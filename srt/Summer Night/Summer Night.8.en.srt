1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,988
We’ll tell them when they are ready.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,554
At least, let’s wait until the school break is over.

3
00:00:03,577 --> 00:00:05,211
I don’t want to hurt her feelings.

4
00:00:05,234 --> 00:00:06,857
White, I have something to tell you.

5
00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:08,720
Although she said she only sees me as a friend,

6
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:10,080
my feelings for her haven’t changed.

7
00:00:10,342 --> 00:00:11,530
I’ll tell him.

8
00:00:11,554 --> 00:00:14,102
I’m okay if she has a boyfriend.

9
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:15,085
But in the meantime,

10
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:16,674
I don’t want to hear about it.

11
00:00:16,685 --> 00:00:18,502
Whether we tell him or not, we will hurt him anyway.

12
00:00:18,525 --> 00:00:20,171
Right now, we need to find out who Sunny is.

13
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:23,931
How could you do this to me?

14
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:25,714
You know that I have feelings for Star.

15
00:00:25,737 --> 00:00:28,290
I was wrong to befriend you.

16
00:00:28,308 --> 00:00:29,988
White, calm down.

17
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,902
Ouch!

18
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:33,897
I guess I didn’t know you well just like you said.

19
00:00:33,911 --> 00:00:36,000
And I no longer want to know you.

20
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:49,714
(I’m a selfish person.)

21
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:52,537
Wait, Lune.

22
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:54,217
Sera, can you leave me alone?

23
00:00:57,860 --> 00:01:00,914
(I am weak. I always run away from problems.)

24
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:05,314
(Lune, aren’t you going to send me off?)
(I avoid facing reality.)

25
00:01:05,337 --> 00:01:06,594
Do you like Star?

26
00:01:07,090 --> 00:01:08,080
No.

27
00:01:08,770 --> 00:01:13,611
(I didn’t realize that I hurt people around me many times by doing that.)

28
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,034
How could you do this to me?

29
00:01:16,057 --> 00:01:18,617
This is why you never had friends.

30
00:01:21,490 --> 00:01:23,782
(I lost my best friend because of it.)

31
00:01:30,910 --> 00:01:32,114
Lune.

32
00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:56,605
Lune.

33
00:02:56,925 --> 00:02:58,285
Why did you come to school so early?

34
00:03:00,205 --> 00:03:01,702
What happened to your mouth?

35
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:05,188
It’s nothing.

36
00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:15,497
I’m sorry.

37
00:03:16,490 --> 00:03:17,611
Jewel.

38
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:19,428
Can I switch seats with you?

39
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:21,817
Why?

40
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:27,177
I don’t want to sit here.

41
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:29,794
I’ll take your seat.

42
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,560
Fine.

43
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:52,788
White.

44
00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:08,880
Jewel.

45
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,308
Can I borrow your pen?

46
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:15,988
But he’s handing you one.

47
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:17,680
But I like this one.

48
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:25,600
What the heck is going on with you two?

49
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:38,205
White is still not talking to you.

50
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:41,497
Yes.

51
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:47,794
Darika, you’re in the same class as Tiwakorn, right?

52
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,542
Yes.

53
00:04:49,565 --> 00:04:52,411
If you see him, tell him that I want to talk to him.

54
00:04:52,434 --> 00:04:53,931
Why?

55
00:04:53,954 --> 00:04:56,765
He’s the only one who hasn’t submitted the paper.

56
00:04:56,780 --> 00:05:00,022
If he doesn’t submit it, I’ll have to give him an F.

57
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:04,022
Yes, Miss. He will submit it.

58
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:11,097
How are you going to tell him?

59
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:17,382
If you get your paper back, you can leave now.

60
00:05:17,405 --> 00:05:19,325
Next, Nontarat.

61
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:28,765
Do you think she knows that I used AI to write the whole paper?

62
00:05:28,788 --> 00:05:30,091
I’m worse.

63
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,931
I didn’t submit the paper.

64
00:05:31,954 --> 00:05:32,994
I will definitely get an F.

65
00:05:33,017 --> 00:05:34,377
Tiwakorn.

66
00:05:35,170 --> 00:05:36,400
Tiwakorn, are you here?

67
00:05:36,434 --> 00:05:37,897
Take your paper back.

68
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:39,314
Yes.

69
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:46,594
The last one, Nilawat.

70
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:08,262
Didn’t you say you didn’t submit it?

71
00:06:08,285 --> 00:06:09,908
I didn’t.

72
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,091
I didn’t write this.

73
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,880
Why did you do it?

74
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:33,794
Do what?

75
00:06:33,817 --> 00:06:34,960
This!

76
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:38,114
What is this?

77
00:06:38,137 --> 00:06:40,502
I heard that you didn’t submit it. I just wanted to submit the paper for you.

78
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:42,822
Can you leave me alone?

79
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:47,257
Are you my friend?

80
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:57,908
I don’t have a sh*tty friend like you.

81
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:00,605
White, why don’t you calm down and talk it out?

82
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:03,405
Right.

83
00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:08,194
You should have talked to me.

84
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:11,954
You shouldn’t have done this.

85
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:43,862
Damn it. You need to tell me what’s going on between you two.

86
00:07:48,090 --> 00:07:49,920
Lune is dating Star.

87
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:52,868
Since the school break.

88
00:08:05,770 --> 00:08:07,382
Now, I understand you.

89
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:12,137
Even if he told you the truth,

90
00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:19,177
I think you would still be mad at him.

91
00:08:25,930 --> 00:08:29,257
If I were him, I wouldn’t have the guts to tell you.

92
00:08:32,594 --> 00:08:33,650
Why?

93
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:37,394
Look at you.

94
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:41,668
You always expressed how much she mean to you.

95
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:46,377
So he chose to hide it from me?

96
00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:51,988
We were friends.

97
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,457
Why didn’t he tell me the truth?

98
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,160
I think…

99
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:16,194
Lune had his reason for not telling you.

100
00:09:18,010 --> 00:09:20,057
Stop making excuses for him.

101
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:28,114
Hey.

102
00:09:31,490 --> 00:09:34,320
Do you think I have ever had a secret with you?

103
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,794
You?

104
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:40,845
No way.

105
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:46,800
I have.

106
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,240
I thought I had feelings for you.

107
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:02,365
But now I know that I didn’t.

108
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:06,194
The point is…

109
00:10:07,210 --> 00:10:09,485
I was afraid to tell you too.

110
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:14,811
I was worried that you would feel awkward.

111
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,794
Do I really have a crush on you?

112
00:10:26,010 --> 00:10:27,040
When did you get here?

113
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:28,457
It’s time for the morning assembly.

114
00:10:36,810 --> 00:10:38,674
When we were in Grade 10, right?

115
00:10:43,070 --> 00:10:44,285
Yes.

116
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,200
You knew?

117
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:49,965
Yes.

118
00:10:49,988 --> 00:10:53,748
I could sense it.

119
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:56,902
Why didn’t you say anything?

120
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:07,497
I was worried that you would feel awkward.

121
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:11,691
I think Lune felt the same way.

122
00:11:12,770 --> 00:11:15,977
We all want to protect each other’s feelings.

123
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:21,828
Do you know why we did that?

124
00:11:22,434 --> 00:11:24,360
It’s because we care about each other.

125
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:33,794
You know what kind of person Lune is.

126
00:11:37,690 --> 00:11:39,931
I think you know him best.

127
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:07,234
White.

128
00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:10,880
White, please hear me out.

129
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,000
Hello.

130
00:12:24,034 --> 00:12:27,188
(Hello. The food you ordered has arrived.)

131
00:12:27,211 --> 00:12:30,000
Alright. Please leave it at the lobby. I’ll go get it.

132
00:12:30,034 --> 00:12:31,817
(Okay. Thank you.)

133
00:13:12,590 --> 00:13:14,125
So annoying.

134
00:13:18,388 --> 00:13:20,240
I mean your bandage.

135
00:13:21,897 --> 00:13:23,780
I’m annoyed when I look at it.

136
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:32,514
Why didn’t you put it on properly?

137
00:13:57,210 --> 00:14:00,674
I’m sorry that I hid their relationship from you.

138
00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:02,880
I know I was wrong.

139
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:05,131
You can scold me as much as you want.

140
00:14:05,410 --> 00:14:07,622
This kind of chance doesn’t come along often.

141
00:14:07,970 --> 00:14:09,805
I can scold you without limit.

142
00:14:10,730 --> 00:14:11,840
You, rascal.

143
00:14:12,045 --> 00:14:14,925
How did you end up scolding me first?

144
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,120
So you are not mad at me anymore?

145
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:18,628
I don’t know.

146
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:25,131
I want you to know that things turned out this way,

147
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:29,017
because everyone tried to protect your feelings.

148
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:30,982
You don’t need to tell me that.

149
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:34,480
I heard it many times.

150
00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:37,245
To tell you the truth,

151
00:14:37,714 --> 00:14:39,710
I still feel bad.

152
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:42,925
I get it.

153
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:45,325
You get it?

154
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:49,005
Why wouldn’t I?

155
00:14:49,370 --> 00:14:51,702
Star didn’t tell me either.

156
00:14:52,570 --> 00:14:56,171
I’m the only one who truly understands how you feel.

157
00:14:57,950 --> 00:15:01,954
Yeah, you also have a crush on Star.

158
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:06,845
How do you feel when seeing them together?

159
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:11,645
It hurts.

160
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:17,611
When I see her being herself when she is with him,

161
00:15:20,571 --> 00:15:22,570
I also feel happy.

162
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:28,400
When she is with him, she looks very happy.

163
00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:32,651
I don’t want her smiles to go away.

164
00:15:41,970 --> 00:15:43,462
To be honest,

165
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:47,668
I just feel bad.

166
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:51,234
I was never mad that she chose him.

167
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:57,771
I’m mad because my friends didn’t tell me the truth.

168
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:04,308
He tried to find a chance to tell you.

169
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:08,594
Right now, I think he really wants to apologize to you.

170
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,622
You should reconcile with him soon.

171
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:16,765
I know. I won’t let it drag on for too long.

172
00:16:18,194 --> 00:16:19,710
One day,

173
00:16:21,405 --> 00:16:23,142
I will be able to forgive him.

174
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:28,297
I don’t want to fight with you again.

175
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:30,297
You were so scary.

176
00:16:30,422 --> 00:16:32,765
Baby, calm down. It’s going to be alright.

177
00:16:32,770 --> 00:16:34,514
Don’t touch me.

178
00:16:34,537 --> 00:16:36,091
You’re annoying.

179
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:38,000
I got to go.

180
00:16:38,034 --> 00:16:39,005
Fine.

181
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:57,360
I got to go.

182
00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:16,468
Lune.

183
00:17:22,690 --> 00:17:23,462
Lune.

184
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:25,954
The leading actor is probably dead.

185
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:34,022
Are you thinking about White?

186
00:17:36,370 --> 00:17:37,508
Yes.

187
00:17:38,731 --> 00:17:40,730
I’ll talk to him.

188
00:17:42,730 --> 00:17:49,474
Since that day, I’ve been trying to find a chance to talk to him.

189
00:17:51,890 --> 00:17:53,382
It’s okay.

190
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:56,125
It’s my fault.

191
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,268
I want to fix it myself.

192
00:18:00,590 --> 00:18:02,411
I’m just mad at myself.

193
00:18:02,571 --> 00:18:04,468
I never changed.

194
00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:09,702
I’m the same old guy who always runs away from problems.

195
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:28,388
Lune.

196
00:18:29,330 --> 00:18:30,560
Look.

197
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:40,205
(I know who the girl is. But who is the guy?)

198
00:18:40,228 --> 00:18:43,337
(Star’s boyfriend must be very handsome.)

199
00:18:43,348 --> 00:18:44,594
(I’ll make him pay if I know who he is.)

200
00:18:44,617 --> 00:18:45,988
(The school’s diva is already taken.)

201
00:18:46,011 --> 00:18:47,474
(I’m heartbroken.)

202
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:51,360
Lune.

203
00:18:57,508 --> 00:18:58,891
Did you see this?

204
00:18:59,170 --> 00:19:02,411
Yes. Who is ‘S.T.’?

205
00:19:02,422 --> 00:19:04,925
There’s only one girl in our school whose initial is ‘S.T.’

206
00:19:04,948 --> 00:19:07,325
Right. Who is the guy?

207
00:19:07,497 --> 00:19:11,040
I don’t know but there are only few good-looking boys in our school.

208
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:17,120
Is that you in the photo?

209
00:19:17,154 --> 00:19:19,062
If not, she looks very much like you.

210
00:19:19,085 --> 00:19:20,937
If the photo is you, I’ll be quite shocked.

211
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:22,160
Is that you in the photo?

212
00:19:22,182 --> 00:19:23,700
Can you ask her later?

213
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:25,451
She has been through a lot already.

214
00:19:25,730 --> 00:19:26,822
Fine.

215
00:19:26,845 --> 00:19:29,154
Since she refuses to say anything, it means…

216
00:19:29,177 --> 00:19:30,274
It means what?

217
00:19:30,450 --> 00:19:32,000
You’re being nosy.

218
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,160
It’s okay, Ivy.

219
00:19:37,330 --> 00:19:39,085
The photo is me.

220
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:41,554
Really? So you have a boyfriend?

221
00:19:41,577 --> 00:19:42,674
Who is he?

222
00:19:42,697 --> 00:19:44,960
Is he the guy you talked about that day?

223
00:19:44,982 --> 00:19:45,954
Is he good-looking?

224
00:19:45,970 --> 00:19:48,297
He must be rich.

225
00:19:48,628 --> 00:19:51,005
Is he Paul, this year’s hot guy?

226
00:19:51,028 --> 00:19:55,508
It must be Kong from Grade 12. He is in the same league as her.

227
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:58,000
You want to be the center of attention, don’t you?

228
00:19:58,022 --> 00:19:59,097
Why are you hiding now?

229
00:19:59,108 --> 00:20:00,960
They are popular. Anyone wants to be their friend.

230
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:02,468
You want to hang out with popular kids, don’t you?

231
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:04,537
(The school’s diva is already taken.)

232
00:20:05,497 --> 00:20:07,200
(I’ll make him pay if I know who he is.)

233
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:13,508
He may be someone we don’t know.

234
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,994
Nana, it’s good that you’re here.

235
00:20:19,017 --> 00:20:20,342
Can I talk to you?

236
00:20:20,365 --> 00:20:21,360
Why?

237
00:20:21,630 --> 00:20:25,714
It’s strange if she is dating.

238
00:20:25,737 --> 00:20:27,291
Am I right, Star?

239
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:32,445
Maybe she wants to keep her relationship a secret.

240
00:20:32,811 --> 00:20:34,810
She might not want to tell anyone about it.

241
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:39,600
It’s kind of romantic.

242
00:20:39,622 --> 00:20:40,742
That’s enough, Nana.

243
00:20:41,588 --> 00:20:43,580
Don’t you see that you make Star feel uncomfortable?

244
00:20:43,930 --> 00:20:46,434
All of you, why do you want to know who he is?

245
00:20:46,457 --> 00:20:49,497
So we can tell if he’s right for her.

246
00:20:49,508 --> 00:20:52,662
Right. Star, can you tell us who he is?

247
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:07,908
It’s me.

248
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:19,405
I’m Star’s boyfriend.

249
00:21:21,462 --> 00:21:23,460
Do you want to know anything else?

250
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:29,657
Then excuse us.

251
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:38,034
Thank you for helping.

252
00:21:39,090 --> 00:21:40,708
I help Star,

253
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:44,068
not you.

254
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:09,017
White, can we talk?

255
00:22:10,090 --> 00:22:12,514
I want to apologize about the other day.

256
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:19,131
I’m sorry about the other day.

257
00:22:21,130 --> 00:22:22,491
It’s okay.

258
00:22:23,070 --> 00:22:24,514
I’m okay.

259
00:22:26,010 --> 00:22:31,417
I was going to tell you about Lune and Star.

260
00:22:31,770 --> 00:22:34,457
But Ivy interrupted me.

261
00:22:36,170 --> 00:22:38,800
Can I ask you something?

262
00:22:40,330 --> 00:22:42,605
Why do you like Star?

263
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,040
It’s because…

264
00:22:48,590 --> 00:22:50,822
Star changed me.

265
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:55,097
Is it because she told you about the art club?

266
00:22:57,980 --> 00:22:59,440
How did you know about it?

267
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:02,491
She didn’t come up with the idea.

268
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:06,720
I was the one who told her about it.

269
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:08,697
Star.

270
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:11,314
Why don’t you ask him?

271
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:14,011
It looks like he hasn’t joined any club.

272
00:23:14,430 --> 00:23:15,428
You mean White?

273
00:23:15,451 --> 00:23:17,382
You know him?

274
00:23:17,405 --> 00:23:19,920
Of course, I’m the class president.

275
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:21,714
Right.

276
00:23:22,610 --> 00:23:25,074
Sure, I’ll ask him.

277
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:29,451
When you were a troubled kid and had no friends,

278
00:23:29,474 --> 00:23:31,657
I was watching.

279
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:36,651
I want to be by your side in every moment.

280
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:40,274
I want you to be happy.

281
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,931
I’m sorry, Nana.

282
00:23:51,610 --> 00:23:53,691
But I don’t think of you that way.

283
00:23:58,010 --> 00:23:59,108
Why?

284
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:02,697
After everything I’ve done for you, you still don’t want to be with me?

285
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:07,280
If it weren’t for me,

286
00:24:07,714 --> 00:24:11,542
no one in the school would know that she has a boyfriend.

287
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:15,188
What do you mean?

288
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:18,822
I just wanted you to know that she has a boyfriend.

289
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:22,800
She kept her relationship a secret because she wanted to continue flirting with you.

290
00:24:23,010 --> 00:24:24,502
It’s not like that, Nana.

291
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:30,388
They kept it a secret because…

292
00:24:37,170 --> 00:24:39,634
they didn’t want to hurt my feelings.

293
00:24:39,890 --> 00:24:40,902
No.

294
00:24:40,925 --> 00:24:45,382
If she was not in the picture, you might have loved me.

295
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:49,554
I’m willing to do anything

296
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:53,097
to be with you.

297
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:56,262
Nana.

298
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:05,897
You should learn to love yourself more.

299
00:25:06,776 --> 00:25:09,343
Don’t do this with other guys.

300
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:11,245
I’m sorry.

301
00:25:25,290 --> 00:25:27,474
Love myself more?

302
00:25:56,290 --> 00:25:57,622
I’m sorry.

303
00:26:21,250 --> 00:26:23,177
Who is Star’s boyfriend?

304
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,880
The guy standing next to White.

305
00:26:24,910 --> 00:26:26,422
He’s so damn good-looking.

306
00:26:26,445 --> 00:26:27,097
He’s so hot.

307
00:26:27,108 --> 00:26:27,725
What’s his name?

308
00:26:27,748 --> 00:26:28,422
I don’t know.

309
00:26:28,445 --> 00:26:30,914
Don’t you have better things to do?

310
00:26:30,937 --> 00:26:33,508
Go away. You are scaring Lune.

311
00:26:35,170 --> 00:26:36,982
Don’t pay attention to them, Lune.

312
00:26:37,005 --> 00:26:40,788
This is your fandom name.

313
00:26:45,690 --> 00:26:46,891
You will get used to it.

314
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,622
Tiwakorn.

315
00:26:53,645 --> 00:26:55,382
Go to the principal’s office now.

316
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:03,280
Do you see the video clip of White and his girlfriend?

317
00:27:03,314 --> 00:27:06,411
Yes. Isn’t the girl Nana?

318
00:27:06,434 --> 00:27:08,331
Yes. It’s steaming.

319
00:27:08,354 --> 00:27:10,331
It’s too bad. The clip is so short.

320
00:27:10,354 --> 00:27:12,982
We haven’t seen anything much but the clip already ended.

321
00:27:13,005 --> 00:27:15,988
Right. When did they start dating?

322
00:27:18,570 --> 00:27:19,920
They seem like a good match.

323
00:27:20,250 --> 00:27:21,554
I hope there will be a longer version of the video.

324
00:27:21,565 --> 00:27:22,502
Me, too.

325
00:27:22,525 --> 00:27:23,794
It’s too bad.

326
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:32,788
Suspension?

327
00:27:32,811 --> 00:27:33,897
Yes.

328
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:36,925
I asked the student council to spy on the teachers.

329
00:27:36,948 --> 00:27:38,937
How did they know that White released the video?

330
00:27:38,971 --> 00:27:41,428
It doesn’t matter who released it.

331
00:27:42,090 --> 00:27:44,388
The clip is spreading and reaches…

332
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:46,674
Nana’s mom.

333
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:50,742
Don’t tell me that…

334
00:27:57,702 --> 00:27:59,680
Who is Nana’s mom?

335
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:07,040
Huh?

336
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:08,880
The president of the parent council?

337
00:28:08,914 --> 00:28:10,160
Yes.

338
00:28:10,570 --> 00:28:14,137
She has good connections and creditability with the other parents.

339
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:17,131
I heard that her dad is a politician or something.

340
00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:19,142
He is pretty well-connected.

341
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:22,708
The principal will be cautious with them.

342
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:26,262
Are you sure that your friend didn’t do it?

343
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:28,022
Yes.

344
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:32,034
White will never do something like that.

345
00:28:32,045 --> 00:28:34,971
If you believe in him, then there’s nothing to worry about.

346
00:28:35,950 --> 00:28:42,114
I think your principal will handle the case fairly, focusing on the facts

347
00:28:42,137 --> 00:28:45,028
rather than their connections or influences.

348
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:58,160
Here’s your coffee.

349
00:29:00,490 --> 00:29:03,691
If you don’t take any action to punish this kid,

350
00:29:03,714 --> 00:29:05,451
I will go all out after him.

351
00:29:05,474 --> 00:29:09,154
But I didn’t do it, Master.

352
00:29:11,090 --> 00:29:13,120
Please calm down, Mrs. Wipa.

353
00:29:13,770 --> 00:29:15,291
You didn’t do it?

354
00:29:15,870 --> 00:29:18,285
Then what are you going to say about the video clip?

355
00:29:18,308 --> 00:29:21,714
My daughter’s reputation is ruined.

356
00:29:24,110 --> 00:29:25,085
Nana.

357
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:28,068
Please say something.

358
00:29:33,250 --> 00:29:34,422
Nana.

359
00:29:35,850 --> 00:29:40,022
You need to punish him otherwise I won’t back down on this.

360
00:29:40,430 --> 00:29:43,737
Master, you know what I am capable of.

361
00:29:45,070 --> 00:29:47,520
Mrs. Wipa, please calm down.

362
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:53,131
If we can prove that Tiwakorn did it,

363
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:57,440
I will issue a suspension as his punishment.

364
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:00,685
Suspension?

365
00:30:01,730 --> 00:30:02,685
Yes.

366
00:30:13,790 --> 00:30:15,737
Something is off about this.

367
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:18,160
I don’t know whether something is off or not.

368
00:30:18,194 --> 00:30:21,200
But I’m sure that Nana’s mom will go all in for it.

369
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:23,680
If they want to use the video to stir things up,

370
00:30:23,930 --> 00:30:25,817
why didn’t they release the whole video?

371
00:30:26,430 --> 00:30:30,011
Maybe they didn’t want us to see what happened after that.

372
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:36,514
If we can find the uncut video, it may be useful to White.

373
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:40,297
That’s possible. What do we do?

374
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:44,971
You don’t have to do anything.

375
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:48,480
White, what did Master say?

376
00:30:49,188 --> 00:30:53,634
If there’s no evidence to prove that I did it,

377
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:56,102
I won’t be suspended.

378
00:30:57,640 --> 00:31:02,811
Thank you, you guys, for trying to help me.

379
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:08,308
If you help me with this, you might get into trouble.

380
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:12,857
I don’t want anyone to get into trouble because of me.

381
00:31:13,851 --> 00:31:15,051
White.

382
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:17,520
Why are you giving up so easily?

383
00:31:17,870 --> 00:31:19,280
I carefully think about this.

384
00:31:20,030 --> 00:31:22,754
Whatever I do, someone will get hurt,

385
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:24,914
including Nana.

386
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:29,931
I think it’s best to let it be.

387
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:40,788
(If there is a chance for me to start confronting a problem,)

388
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:43,420
(I think this is my chance.)

389
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:46,880
No.

390
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:48,857
You can’t let it be.

391
00:31:48,868 --> 00:31:50,205
There must be a way to fix it.

392
00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:10,285
Lune didn’t come to school today?

393
00:32:10,650 --> 00:32:13,394
I don’t know. I haven’t seen him.

394
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:15,200
He did come to school.

395
00:32:15,234 --> 00:32:16,810
I saw him this morning.

396
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:19,862
Where is he?

397
00:32:36,190 --> 00:32:38,251
Aren’t you going to do anything about it?

398
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,571
I tried.

399
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:50,091
I tried so hard that I realized I could never change Nana’s mom’s mind.

400
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:52,720
I gave up.

401
00:32:56,130 --> 00:32:58,320
Is that Lune?

402
00:33:11,050 --> 00:33:12,068
Nana.

403
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,177
Wait, Nana.

404
00:33:13,188 --> 00:33:13,874
Nana.

405
00:33:13,897 --> 00:33:15,485
Lune, stop it.

406
00:33:15,497 --> 00:33:17,177
I have nothing to say.

407
00:33:25,870 --> 00:33:27,131
How can I help you?

408
00:33:27,154 --> 00:33:30,674
Can I see the footage of the CCTV at the science lab?

409
00:33:30,697 --> 00:33:31,702
No.

410
00:33:31,725 --> 00:33:34,137
You need to contact Master and get an official request.

411
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:36,982
Can’t you help me? Please, I’m begging you.

412
00:33:37,005 --> 00:33:40,720
Please help me. I lost something very important to me there.

413
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:42,068
I can’t help you.

414
00:33:42,091 --> 00:33:45,897
I’m begging you. Can you help me just this once?

415
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:49,577
Please.

416
00:33:50,308 --> 00:33:51,782
Thank you.

417
00:33:56,750 --> 00:34:00,262
Are there other cameras or a camera in the room?

418
00:34:00,285 --> 00:34:03,497
No, this is the only camera at the science lab.

419
00:34:06,190 --> 00:34:07,577
Thank you.

420
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:27,120
Nontarat.

421
00:34:27,154 --> 00:34:27,860
Hello.

422
00:34:27,885 --> 00:34:29,165
What are you doing here so early?

423
00:34:30,380 --> 00:34:32,800
I want to talk to you about White again.

424
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:39,794
I understand that you are worried about your friend.

425
00:34:40,034 --> 00:34:42,205
But this is a serious matter.

426
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:47,325
Tiwakorn has no evidence to prove that he didn’t do it.

427
00:34:47,790 --> 00:34:52,811
Nutnicha’s mom will never back down on this.

428
00:34:54,210 --> 00:34:55,737
You need to accept the reality.

429
00:35:16,830 --> 00:35:18,080
Hey.

430
00:35:18,570 --> 00:35:20,605
You don’t need to pack your stuff yet.

431
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:24,011
Master will make his decision tomorrow, won’t he?

432
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:27,291
Whether it’s today or tomorrow, it makes no difference.

433
00:35:29,970 --> 00:35:31,691
Can you help me pack my stuff?

434
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:48,902
(I thought if I stood up and dealt with the problem,)

435
00:35:52,430 --> 00:35:54,594
(I would be helpful to someone.)

436
00:35:57,490 --> 00:36:00,571
(But in the end, I can’t do anything.)

437
00:36:04,811 --> 00:36:06,810
(I can’t do anything…)

438
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,320
(to help my best friend.)

439
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:19,828
The door is not locked.

440
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:24,262
Can I take the sprouts?

441
00:36:24,285 --> 00:36:26,285
Sure. Please close the door.

442
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:28,194
Where is the camera?

443
00:36:28,217 --> 00:36:30,000
I took it back yesterday.

444
00:36:30,034 --> 00:36:31,988
I was afraid that it would be stolen if I left it here overnight.

445
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:34,765
I watched the video from the camera yesterday.

446
00:36:34,788 --> 00:36:36,514
I saw someone in the video.

447
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:39,108
So the camera focused on them instead of the sprouts.

448
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:40,582
The video is ruined. Look.

449
00:36:40,605 --> 00:36:43,005
Let’s delete it and take a new one.

450
00:36:43,028 --> 00:36:46,640
Our GPA is important to our admission to med school in the next five years.

451
00:36:46,810 --> 00:36:49,074
That’s right. Let’s delete it.

452
00:36:49,097 --> 00:36:50,925
Wait, wait.

453
00:36:50,948 --> 00:36:52,920
Can I see the video?

454
00:36:52,948 --> 00:36:54,114
Who are you?

455
00:36:54,137 --> 00:36:55,828
Are you here to spy on our project?

456
00:36:56,030 --> 00:36:58,422
I know that everyone wants to know about other group’s performance

457
00:36:58,445 --> 00:37:01,028
because of the norm-referenced grading system.

458
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:06,537
I…

459
00:37:06,750 --> 00:37:08,342
I’m in a med school prep group.

460
00:37:08,365 --> 00:37:10,742
Sure, you can see it.

461
00:37:23,570 --> 00:37:25,222
Can I take the video?

462
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:26,800
Can I take the video?

463
00:37:26,834 --> 00:37:28,571
Are you going to copy us?

464
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:31,120
I’m going to…

465
00:37:31,390 --> 00:37:34,148
submit it to the National Science Olympiad on your behalf.

466
00:37:34,171 --> 00:37:35,920
Sure. Take it.

467
00:37:44,570 --> 00:37:45,908
Thank you so much.

468
00:37:45,931 --> 00:37:47,040
Don’t forget to delete it.

469
00:37:47,074 --> 00:37:50,240
The next time you record a video, switch to manual focus.

470
00:37:50,274 --> 00:37:50,891
I got to go.

471
00:37:52,510 --> 00:37:55,645
Damn. This is why he’s a med school prep.

472
00:37:55,668 --> 00:37:56,731
True.

473
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,314
Everyone.

474
00:38:04,210 --> 00:38:07,988
(This is how it feels when I overcome a problem.)

475
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:13,885
Damn.

476
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:17,302
Where did you get the video?

477
00:38:17,565 --> 00:38:19,690
I was in a med school prep group.

478
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,542
Huh? What?

479
00:38:21,565 --> 00:38:23,474
Forget it. It’s a long story.

480
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:28,137
Let’s upload the video on the internet.

481
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:29,657
Are you sure?

482
00:38:29,950 --> 00:38:33,462
Just showing it to Master would be enough.

483
00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:36,994
It’s enough to prove that White is innocent.

484
00:38:47,060 --> 00:38:48,902
Can you send me the video?

485
00:38:49,850 --> 00:38:50,811
Sure.

486
00:38:52,250 --> 00:38:54,228
Then delete the copy you have.

487
00:38:54,251 --> 00:38:55,337
Huh?

488
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:14,377
I got it.

489
00:39:14,811 --> 00:39:16,000
White.

490
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:19,108
Are you the only one who has the video?

491
00:39:19,131 --> 00:39:20,217
Yes.

492
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:23,062
I’m afraid that it may be leaked and ruin Nana’s reputation.

493
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:25,565
So I want to show it to you first.

494
00:39:27,620 --> 00:39:30,240
I will delete it.

495
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:38,765
I don’t want it to ruin her reputation or mine.

496
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:42,411
Nana already told me the truth.

497
00:39:43,170 --> 00:39:45,588
But she told me after things were already getting out of hand.

498
00:39:45,622 --> 00:39:49,360
You know that I’m the president of the parent council, right?

499
00:39:49,540 --> 00:39:52,925
Her dad is going to run for election.

500
00:39:52,948 --> 00:39:56,022
I can’t let anyone know about this.

501
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:57,817
I’m sorry.

502
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:18,685
White.

503
00:40:22,260 --> 00:40:24,285
Aren’t you going to do anything about it?

504
00:40:26,410 --> 00:40:27,771
What do you want me to do?

505
00:40:27,794 --> 00:40:30,285
Why did you let my mom do that?

506
00:40:31,150 --> 00:40:34,480
Do you know that you will be suspended?

507
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:37,977
So what?

508
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:41,097
What your mom said is right.

509
00:40:41,490 --> 00:40:44,102
This is the way to keep you from being affected by this.

510
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:46,708
It’s not time for you to worry about others.

511
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:49,200
Why don’t love yourself?

512
00:40:51,450 --> 00:40:52,880
What about you?

513
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:56,400
Do you love yourself?

514
00:40:58,620 --> 00:41:02,240
I told you that you need to love yourself more.

515
00:41:05,090 --> 00:41:09,040
I just want you to pay attention to me.

516
00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:15,142
I really care about you.

517
00:41:15,370 --> 00:41:17,337
This is not how it’s supposed to be.

518
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:20,000
I still have the uncut video.

519
00:41:21,140 --> 00:41:23,645
Your mom didn’t delete it from the Trash folder.

520
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:27,931
But I’ll delete it.

521
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:33,611
Even if the uncut video is released,

522
00:41:33,634 --> 00:41:38,080
your mom will never let things go the way we want them to.

523
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:47,428
We are the only people who know the truth.

524
00:42:14,830 --> 00:42:17,862
(White, why did you delete the video?)

525
00:42:17,885 --> 00:42:19,634
(It’s not time to be a hero.)

526
00:42:19,657 --> 00:42:24,217
(Do we have another copy? Can we restore the file from your phone?)

527
00:42:37,090 --> 00:42:38,628
Tiwakorn.

528
00:42:42,300 --> 00:42:44,514
I’ll input codes A, B, and C.

529
00:42:44,537 --> 00:42:47,531
When I debug code A and B, I’ll cross-phase everything.

530
00:42:47,565 --> 00:42:49,954
When I retract everything,

531
00:42:50,590 --> 00:42:52,868
I think we can restore it.

532
00:42:52,994 --> 00:42:56,377
Damn. This is the first time you are being useful.

533
00:42:56,690 --> 00:42:58,000
Jewel, have you ever restored a file before?

534
00:42:58,034 --> 00:43:00,948
No, I watched videos on YouTube and repeated what I heard from movies to look cool.

535
00:43:03,970 --> 00:43:05,805
It’s better than doing nothing.

536
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:09,531
Guys.

537
00:43:10,750 --> 00:43:13,142
You don’t need to do anything anymore.

538
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:16,297
Why are you saying that, White?

539
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:18,788
We are trying to help you.

540
00:43:21,260 --> 00:43:25,074
Thank you for trying to help me.

541
00:43:28,450 --> 00:43:32,148
But from now on, I…

542
00:43:48,380 --> 00:43:50,411
I didn’t get a suspension.

543
00:43:50,434 --> 00:43:51,668
Huh?

544
00:43:52,100 --> 00:43:54,708
You didn’t get any punishment?

545
00:43:54,742 --> 00:43:55,508
Yes.

546
00:43:55,531 --> 00:43:58,331
Why the hell did you make us anxious?

547
00:43:59,380 --> 00:44:01,428
Did Nana’s mom back down?

548
00:44:01,450 --> 00:44:04,742
Nana’s mom…

549
00:44:05,170 --> 00:44:08,537
Nutnicha told me the truth.

550
00:44:09,310 --> 00:44:12,811
She said that you didn’t do what the video clip suggested.

551
00:44:14,670 --> 00:44:17,588
What about Nana’s mom?

552
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:24,982
I think they talked and she agreed to drop the matter.

553
00:44:29,810 --> 00:44:33,348
So Nana confessed everything?

554
00:44:33,371 --> 00:44:35,851
Didn’t her mom say anything?

555
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:41,005
No one can stop Nana’s mom except Nana.

556
00:44:42,091 --> 00:44:47,017
So I thought Nana was the only one who could solve this problem.

557
00:44:47,700 --> 00:44:50,285
Damn. You chose the right time to be a hero.

558
00:44:53,090 --> 00:44:54,491
Anyway,

559
00:44:54,990 --> 00:44:58,480
I want to thank all of you again for trying to help me.

560
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:02,514
You were busy helping me.

561
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:08,342
You know that the person who is worried about you the most is her.

562
00:45:08,365 --> 00:45:10,148
She can’t stay still for a minute.

563
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:12,137
She forced me to debug codes.

564
00:45:12,148 --> 00:45:13,817
Jewel, you are talking too much.

565
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:16,662
I’m just afraid that I will be lonely if my bickering partner is gone.

566
00:45:16,930 --> 00:45:19,691
If he’s gone, I’ll have no one to bicker with.

567
00:45:20,100 --> 00:45:21,211
Really?

568
00:45:21,790 --> 00:45:22,914
Yes.

569
00:45:25,170 --> 00:45:27,394
Let’s go eat and celebrate.

570
00:45:27,417 --> 00:45:28,468
Sure.

571
00:45:28,491 --> 00:45:30,868
Let’s go. I’m hungry.

572
00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:49,325
Lune.

573
00:45:51,100 --> 00:45:52,674
Come with us.

574
00:45:53,390 --> 00:45:54,582
Are you hungry?

575
00:45:57,940 --> 00:45:59,017
Yes.

576
00:46:02,030 --> 00:46:03,222
Lune.

577
00:46:05,020 --> 00:46:07,222
I want to thank you.

578
00:46:07,470 --> 00:46:09,382
In the past few days,

579
00:46:10,320 --> 00:46:12,411
I saw what you did to help me.

580
00:46:15,850 --> 00:46:17,440
Thank you so much.

581
00:46:22,050 --> 00:46:25,382
Does this mean you two have reconciled?

582
00:46:26,850 --> 00:46:27,645
No.

583
00:46:28,685 --> 00:46:33,108
Lune needs to buy me a meal first. Then I’ll stop being mad at him.

584
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:35,960
Sure.

585
00:46:37,460 --> 00:46:39,702
Yeah. I’m going to cry.

586
00:46:39,725 --> 00:46:42,925
My two best friends have finally reconciled.

587
00:46:42,948 --> 00:46:46,365
And I will get a free meal today.

588
00:46:47,050 --> 00:46:49,462
Damn. Aren’t you rich?

589
00:46:49,860 --> 00:46:52,251
I am but I don’t want to pay.

590
00:46:53,650 --> 00:46:57,131
(That’s right. I’m selfish.)

591
00:46:57,360 --> 00:46:58,902
(I am weak.)

592
00:46:58,925 --> 00:47:01,177
(I run away from problems.)

593
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:04,011
(But I am lucky to have friends.)

594
00:47:04,810 --> 00:47:07,314
(They help me to be a better person,)

595
00:47:07,720 --> 00:47:09,394
(and a braver person)

596
00:47:09,645 --> 00:47:12,571
(So I can protect myself and the people that I love.)

597
00:47:12,845 --> 00:47:15,725
(From now on, I’ll become a new person.)

598
00:47:15,930 --> 00:47:20,720
(who learns from my mistakes and won’t let the horrible past happen again.)

599
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:41,394
Lune.

600
00:47:49,390 --> 00:47:50,868
I admit my defeat.

601
00:47:57,180 --> 00:47:58,891
Star chose you.

602
00:48:02,810 --> 00:48:04,914
Don’t ever hurt her feelings.

603
00:48:11,714 --> 00:48:12,948
I promise.

604
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:22,868
Sera.

605
00:48:26,510 --> 00:48:27,988
Lune.

606
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:37,908
It happened again.

607
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:54,285
Someone is here to see you.

608
00:48:54,308 --> 00:48:56,114
Sera is moving to the US and will stay there for a while.

609
00:48:56,125 --> 00:48:59,017
Let’s make the time we have left with Sera a good time.

610
00:48:59,028 --> 00:48:59,542
What are you thinking?

611
00:48:59,565 --> 00:49:01,657
I’m thinking that I want to be a better person.

612
00:49:01,668 --> 00:49:02,822
You can do it.

613
00:49:03,100 --> 00:49:06,491
Ivy, do you think we are replaceable?

614
00:49:06,514 --> 00:49:08,868
Why don’t you ask him again?

615
00:49:08,891 --> 00:49:10,582
Just have a simple meal together.

616
00:49:10,605 --> 00:49:13,017
Make it a quality time for you two.

617
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:15,360
Star, do you think I still have feelings for Sera?
