1
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:09,448
Lune.

2
00:00:13,928 --> 00:00:15,208
I like you.

3
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:19,795
Do you feel the same way?

4
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:23,751
I…

5
00:00:24,088 --> 00:00:26,524
I was a troubled kid.

6
00:00:26,568 --> 00:00:28,693
Until someone came into my life.

7
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:30,515
After that, my life has changed completely.

8
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:33,466
She changed my world.

9
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:35,777
Thank you.

10
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:37,253
Star.

11
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:39,991
I have a secret to tell you.

12
00:00:40,017 --> 00:00:41,120
I like Star.

13
00:00:41,733 --> 00:00:43,730
What about you? Is there anyone you like?

14
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:47,288
Lune.

15
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:56,026
I…

16
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:03,653
I don’t feel the same way as you.

17
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:19,075
I’m sorry if I misled you. I didn’t think of you as…

18
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:19,715
Um…

19
00:01:20,577 --> 00:01:21,710
It’s okay.

20
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:30,613
Thank you for being honest with me.

21
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:33,475
Star.

22
00:01:36,071 --> 00:01:37,608
I’m okay.

23
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,457
I’m really okay.

24
00:01:49,244 --> 00:01:50,373
I got to go.

25
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:11,191
(There have been many times that I didn’t express…)

26
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:15,022
(…my true feelings.)

27
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,413
(But none of them…)

28
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:24,524
(…was more hurtful than this time.)

29
00:02:34,817 --> 00:02:35,937
Star.

30
00:03:10,382 --> 00:03:12,380
Who made you cry?

31
00:03:18,702 --> 00:03:20,168
You don’t need to tell me.

32
00:03:20,471 --> 00:03:22,257
Let’s sleep here tonight.

33
00:03:22,693 --> 00:03:24,888
I’ll stay with you all night, okay?

34
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,471
Thank you.

35
00:03:40,862 --> 00:03:41,484
Come here.

36
00:03:47,697 --> 00:03:49,013
Don’t cry.

37
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:35,733
White.

38
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:36,444
I…

39
00:05:37,537 --> 00:05:38,471
I’ll go to the classroom first.

40
00:05:49,137 --> 00:05:50,470
Give him some time.

41
00:05:51,057 --> 00:05:51,831
Alright.

42
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:57,680
Do you think Sunny’s post is true? She said Star was flirting with White.

43
00:05:57,710 --> 00:05:58,737
I think it’s true.

44
00:05:58,773 --> 00:06:01,395
Otherwise, White wouldn’t pull a stunt like that.
(You’ve been flirting with him. But when he confessed his love, you broke his heart in front of the whole school.)

45
00:06:01,555 --> 00:06:05,982
They say if you watch the video closely, you’ll see Star smirking.

46
00:06:06,017 --> 00:06:07,573
Really? Let me see.

47
00:06:07,608 --> 00:06:09,333
Wait. Stop it.

48
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:17,191
When did my friend smirk?

49
00:06:17,235 --> 00:06:18,346
Take a screenshot and show it to me.

50
00:06:18,382 --> 00:06:21,706
If you can’t find it, can I hit all of you?

51
00:06:22,755 --> 00:06:23,777
Ivy.

52
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:27,831
Thanks.

53
00:06:28,524 --> 00:06:29,440
It’s nothing.

54
00:06:30,817 --> 00:06:32,790
Show me what you’ve got, brats.

55
00:06:34,168 --> 00:06:35,617
Who the heck is Sunny?

56
00:06:35,662 --> 00:06:37,697
The post intentionally attacks you.

57
00:06:37,742 --> 00:06:38,755
Forget it.

58
00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:53,448
What’s up with you two?

59
00:06:57,297 --> 00:06:58,471
Hello, Lune.

60
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:02,764
Let’s go to the classroom.

61
00:07:05,137 --> 00:07:06,533
Don’t mess with me.

62
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:15,155
These two won’t come to the class, will they?

63
00:07:15,564 --> 00:07:17,120
How long will he keep avoiding you?

64
00:07:21,742 --> 00:07:22,915
White.

65
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:26,168
Let’s go to the class.

66
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,275
Lune, can you tell him to go to the class?

67
00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:31,893
The teacher is taking a roll call. Let’s go to the class.

68
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,728
You two should go. Don’t wait for me.

69
00:07:35,795 --> 00:07:37,400
Look at you.

70
00:07:38,568 --> 00:07:41,226
Why are you avoiding Star?

71
00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:42,995
I’m not avoiding her.

72
00:07:43,244 --> 00:07:44,657
Then what the hell is wrong with you?

73
00:07:45,448 --> 00:07:46,650
Are you mad at her?

74
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,577
No, I’m not mad at her.

75
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,240
I just don’t know how to face her.

76
00:08:01,450 --> 00:08:03,057
I need some time to sort my feelings out.

77
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:10,791
It’s good that I have you two by my side.

78
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:29,217
Guys, since you are here, I have an important thing to tell you.

79
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:33,235
I want to put the comics project on a break.

80
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:37,217
I’m not in the mood to do it.

81
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,026
Sure.

82
00:08:41,810 --> 00:08:44,888
We can start again when you are ready.

83
00:08:48,090 --> 00:08:50,702
Your feelings should come first.

84
00:08:54,330 --> 00:08:56,053
Thanks, you guys.

85
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:04,746
I love you so much.

86
00:09:08,570 --> 00:09:11,484
Before the final exam next week, I have the last assignment for you.

87
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:17,928
You need to form a group of five. Please select your members.

88
00:09:18,337 --> 00:09:19,386
I’ll write my name down first.

89
00:09:37,911 --> 00:09:39,022
Back at it again.

90
00:09:40,613 --> 00:09:41,066
Shh!

91
00:09:41,937 --> 00:09:42,862
White.

92
00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:52,773
You can join my group. I need two more members.

93
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:56,746
Nana, I…

94
00:09:56,773 --> 00:09:57,831
White, it’s okay.

95
00:09:59,210 --> 00:10:00,577
Ivy and I will join her group.

96
00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:07,093
Can Ivy and I join your group?

97
00:10:07,253 --> 00:10:08,586
Sure.

98
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:29,457
(Our meeting at the gallery is postponed to 1 pm.)

99
00:10:29,493 --> 00:10:31,777
What the hell did I get up early for?

100
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:39,431
Boonrot, please pull over.

101
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,066
What are you doing?

102
00:10:45,457 --> 00:10:46,631
You.

103
00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:48,871
What are you doing here?

104
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:52,097
My car passed by and I saw you.

105
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:53,484
You have a good memory.

106
00:10:53,528 --> 00:10:56,017
We haven’t seen each other for over two days but you still remember me.

107
00:10:56,053 --> 00:10:57,102
It’s because you are unforgettable.

108
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,280
So what are you doing here?

109
00:11:01,315 --> 00:11:02,995
Do you know how to fix a motorcycle?

110
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:05,840
My bike breaks down.

111
00:11:06,044 --> 00:11:08,302
I have drinks to deliver to customers.

112
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:14,942
I don’t know how to fix it but I can give you a ride.

113
00:11:19,013 --> 00:11:20,000
That car?

114
00:11:23,610 --> 00:11:24,693
Are you serious?

115
00:11:26,430 --> 00:11:28,124
I’m waiting in front of the house.

116
00:11:32,666 --> 00:11:33,955
Hello.

117
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:36,906
Two drinks for you. 200 baht.

118
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:40,533
Thank you.

119
00:11:40,577 --> 00:11:41,537
Right.

120
00:11:43,368 --> 00:11:46,631
Hurry up. We have several deliveries to do.

121
00:11:46,782 --> 00:11:47,555
I got it.

122
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:53,395
Those who do not despise small earnings will never lack.

123
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:57,608
Mom, let’s open a drink stand.

124
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:02,942
Jewel is not answering his phone.

125
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,488
Let’s wait for him here.

126
00:12:08,666 --> 00:12:10,115
He will call us when he gets here.

127
00:12:12,770 --> 00:12:13,600
Look.

128
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:18,133
White, you also came to this gallery.

129
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:37,555
Lune.

130
00:12:38,008 --> 00:12:39,404
Jewel is inside, right?

131
00:12:40,650 --> 00:12:43,342
We should go inside.

132
00:12:47,530 --> 00:12:48,097
Let’s go.

133
00:12:55,590 --> 00:12:58,008
He’s so annoying. Shall I punch him?

134
00:12:58,044 --> 00:13:01,235
It’s alright, Ivy. I’m okay.

135
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:03,230
You always say you’re okay.

136
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:07,022
Wait here. I’ll buy the tickets for you.

137
00:13:08,426 --> 00:13:09,137
Thanks.

138
00:13:15,697 --> 00:13:16,622
Star.

139
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,875
Don’t overthink it.

140
00:13:20,311 --> 00:13:20,844
Huh?

141
00:13:21,390 --> 00:13:23,048
About White,

142
00:13:24,130 --> 00:13:26,684
I think you did the right thing.

143
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:31,733
If you don’t like him, it’s best to reject him.

144
00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:40,995
Even though he feels humiliated,

145
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:48,346
he will get over it. Don’t worry.

146
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,031
White.

147
00:14:39,395 --> 00:14:43,333
Star, I…

148
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,333
- I’m sorry. 		- I’m sorry.

149
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:51,466
I’m sorry for that day.

150
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:55,777
I humiliated you in front of everyone.

151
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:05,742
It’s okay. I’m not mad at you.

152
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:09,777
It was my fault.

153
00:15:12,690 --> 00:15:14,515
I shouldn’t have done what I did.

154
00:15:17,010 --> 00:15:18,062
I’m really sorry.

155
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:25,457
White, it’s okay.

156
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:37,635
To be honest, I don’t mean to avoid you.

157
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:42,666
I just don’t know how to face you.

158
00:15:52,871 --> 00:15:53,920
So…

159
00:15:56,106 --> 00:15:58,195
can we go back to be friends?

160
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,053
Yes.

161
00:16:15,590 --> 00:16:16,817
Let’s go back to be friends.

162
00:16:31,928 --> 00:16:33,920
Even if I could turn back time,

163
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,920
I would still fall for you.

164
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:51,360
If you see my other sides, you might not fall for me.

165
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,208
No.

166
00:16:57,190 --> 00:17:02,222
I didn’t fall for you because you are remarkable or perfect

167
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:13,102
I fell for you because you made me believe in myself.

168
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:15,911
White, you are smart.

169
00:17:16,195 --> 00:17:17,760
You may not realize it yet.

170
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:20,533
I do.

171
00:17:21,690 --> 00:17:28,471
I realized that at least someone saw me even when I was in the darkest place.

172
00:17:32,330 --> 00:17:33,777
You’ve had feelings for me since then?

173
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:39,315
Yes.

174
00:17:48,390 --> 00:17:50,062
I never knew it.

175
00:17:52,390 --> 00:17:57,431
I didn’t think that you would remember it.

176
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:01,262
It's okay.

177
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:06,000
Although I can’t stop my feelings for you,

178
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:13,173
I am glad I have the chance to tell you how I feel.

179
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:21,982
Thank you, White.

180
00:18:31,137 --> 00:18:32,400
I think it’s best for us…

181
00:18:34,970 --> 00:18:35,964
to be friends.

182
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:48,755
Yes.

183
00:19:10,613 --> 00:19:12,610
I only went to work with you for one day.

184
00:19:12,657 --> 00:19:13,662
I’m already exhausted.

185
00:19:14,008 --> 00:19:15,660
Are you doing this every day?

186
00:19:15,822 --> 00:19:16,986
Only sometimes.

187
00:19:17,422 --> 00:19:18,711
But we got many delivery orders today.

188
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:23,751
Hey, aren’t you going to add any condiments?

189
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:26,577
I’m not good at it.

190
00:19:27,050 --> 00:19:32,071
My parents told me that I should eat the food the way they are served.

191
00:19:32,115 --> 00:19:33,493
Otherwise, it would be disrespectful to the chef.

192
00:19:33,555 --> 00:19:37,466
But this chef puts the condiments right in front of you.

193
00:19:37,502 --> 00:19:38,524
I don’t think she would mind it.

194
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:40,302
Give it to me. I’ll do it for you.

195
00:19:52,586 --> 00:19:54,382
Taste it, my flavor.

196
00:20:06,488 --> 00:20:11,120
From the look on your face, I guess you like your food to be sweet.

197
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:37,342
Taste it and see if it’s sweet enough.

198
00:20:44,370 --> 00:20:44,977
How is it?

199
00:20:47,937 --> 00:20:49,930
The one last thing we need.

200
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:52,133
The secret ingredient.

201
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,355
What is it?

202
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:55,431
Chili sauce.

203
00:20:55,635 --> 00:20:56,044
Huh?

204
00:20:56,070 --> 00:20:57,644
Trust me. It’s my recipe.

205
00:21:04,853 --> 00:21:06,355
Taste it.

206
00:21:10,737 --> 00:21:11,475
How is it?

207
00:21:13,010 --> 00:21:14,000
It’s delicious.

208
00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:16,675
Why are you good at this?

209
00:21:17,324 --> 00:21:18,670
You make it look so easy.

210
00:21:19,004 --> 00:21:20,284
It was not easy.

211
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:25,857
Before I found the perfect recipe, I tried and failed dozens of times.

212
00:21:26,177 --> 00:21:29,902
Do you know that the noodle soups in each shop taste different?

213
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:33,608
Even the levels of sourness of the vinegar in each shop are different.

214
00:21:34,770 --> 00:21:38,408
You have the easiest life. Your chef cooks it perfectly for you.

215
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:40,720
In your eyes, my life looks that easy?

216
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:44,542
Maybe because I’m living alone in Bangkok.

217
00:21:44,586 --> 00:21:46,097
So I feel that everything in my life is hard.

218
00:21:46,355 --> 00:21:48,090
What about your friends?

219
00:21:48,746 --> 00:21:50,124
I don’t have many friends.

220
00:21:50,586 --> 00:21:52,968
I transferred to this school in the middle of the semester. So I don’t have many friends.

221
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:56,400
When I’m at school, I have no one to talk to.

222
00:21:56,764 --> 00:21:59,973
To be honest, I talk the most when I’m with you.

223
00:22:11,190 --> 00:22:14,524
I think we all have difficulties in life.

224
00:22:14,755 --> 00:22:16,520
Seasoning the noodles,

225
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,551
it’s so hard for me.

226
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:25,715
There are other difficult things in my life.

227
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:32,888
When the elevator in my house broke down and I needed to use the stairs.

228
00:22:32,933 --> 00:22:36,293
I realized how tiring it was to walk up the stairs.

229
00:22:37,910 --> 00:22:41,813
When my maid was not around and I had to search for my PS5 joystick,

230
00:22:41,857 --> 00:22:45,315
I realized how hard living alone was.

231
00:22:45,351 --> 00:22:46,471
Those are the difficult things in your life?

232
00:22:46,506 --> 00:22:47,191
Yes.

233
00:22:47,790 --> 00:22:50,728
But the most difficult thing is to select clothes from my walk-in closet.

234
00:22:50,764 --> 00:22:54,560
I have hundreds of pieces of clothes. I can’t decide what to wear.

235
00:22:54,604 --> 00:22:56,471
But no one understands this problem I have.

236
00:22:56,506 --> 00:22:59,140
It’s really hard. You know what I mean, don’t you?

237
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:04,720
I know what you mean. I truly understand you.

238
00:23:04,933 --> 00:23:06,373
Let’s eat.

239
00:23:06,930 --> 00:23:10,364
This meal is on me. I want to repay you for helping me.

240
00:23:20,604 --> 00:23:21,324
Sorry.

241
00:23:21,902 --> 00:23:23,031
It’s okay.

242
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:28,160
Are you okay?

243
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:30,293
Yes, I’m okay.

244
00:23:30,770 --> 00:23:33,422
I’m talking about Star.

245
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:38,897
I’m worried about you.

246
00:23:39,146 --> 00:23:41,484
Star shouldn’t humiliate you like that.

247
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:45,635
Thank you for worrying about me, Nana.

248
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:47,768
But I…

249
00:23:47,804 --> 00:23:53,111
To tell you the truth, I think you can find a better girl than Star.

250
00:23:59,950 --> 00:24:02,675
I already talked to Star.

251
00:24:03,093 --> 00:24:05,128
How do you feel?

252
00:24:06,050 --> 00:24:09,226
I feel...

253
00:24:12,230 --> 00:24:15,688
that I need to check out other zones.

254
00:24:15,982 --> 00:24:16,791
Ivy.

255
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:19,697
Are you going to zone B?

256
00:24:20,110 --> 00:24:21,315
Me? Going to zone B?

257
00:24:21,351 --> 00:24:22,488
I’m going with you.

258
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:24,924
I got to go.

259
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:28,275
I’m going to zone B?

260
00:24:28,311 --> 00:24:29,848
Yes, you are.

261
00:25:00,142 --> 00:25:02,435
Lune, did you check out the Pottery Zone?

262
00:25:04,990 --> 00:25:05,804
No.

263
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:07,973
Really?

264
00:25:14,462 --> 00:25:16,435
The pictures in this zone are pretty.

265
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:18,017
Star.

266
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:20,311
About that day, I…

267
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:22,346
This picture is funny.

268
00:25:31,010 --> 00:25:34,888
Star, I’m sorry about that day.

269
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,115
It’s okay.

270
00:25:50,110 --> 00:25:51,360
I’m fine.

271
00:25:53,173 --> 00:25:54,133
I’m okay.

272
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:04,764
That picture is also funny.

273
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:10,444
Can you not do this?

274
00:26:16,755 --> 00:26:17,786
Do what?

275
00:26:22,450 --> 00:26:24,115
I told you I’m okay.

276
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:29,848
Star.

277
00:26:29,875 --> 00:26:31,840
I can go back to be your friend.

278
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:00,151
I’m going to check out other zones.

279
00:27:48,830 --> 00:27:51,831
Dad, you are saying this because you don’t understand me.

280
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:55,448
You’ve never known how I really feel.

281
00:27:57,770 --> 00:28:04,017
I have to force myself to smile in front of everyone but I’m crying inside.

282
00:28:04,490 --> 00:28:08,195
I can neither tell anyone how I feel nor cry.

283
00:28:09,490 --> 00:28:12,551
But I can’t take it anymore. I need to cry and let it out.

284
00:29:09,370 --> 00:29:12,088
This is funny. We were crying a few minutes ago.

285
00:29:13,810 --> 00:29:14,622
That’s true.

286
00:29:14,871 --> 00:29:18,488
Everything you said was exactly how I felt.

287
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:20,711
The more I listened to you, the harder I cried.

288
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:24,595
I barely cried in front of anyone.

289
00:29:26,110 --> 00:29:29,760
Maybe because I don’t want to send out negative energy.

290
00:29:32,990 --> 00:29:38,062
So everyone thinks you are always strong and lively.

291
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:39,653
Yes.

292
00:29:40,590 --> 00:29:44,826
No one knows how I really feel.

293
00:29:47,590 --> 00:29:52,471
There are some days that I can’t take it anymore.

294
00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:55,537
I just want to cry without caring about anything.

295
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,795
Yes, it’s exactly like that.

296
00:29:57,822 --> 00:30:01,235
I feel like I can’t hold it in anymore.

297
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:04,542
I know what you mean.

298
00:30:05,420 --> 00:30:06,480
This is great.

299
00:30:07,370 --> 00:30:08,871
At least…

300
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:13,911
On the day I let it all out, it’s good to have a friend to cry with.

301
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:16,160
Friend?

302
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:20,266
Yes, friend.

303
00:30:21,170 --> 00:30:21,857
Why?

304
00:30:23,170 --> 00:30:27,048
Nothing. I haven’t had this kind of moment for some time.

305
00:30:29,306 --> 00:30:30,177
Why?

306
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:37,271
My dad works in several countries. So I often move.

307
00:30:37,315 --> 00:30:40,391
I’m moving around so often that I barely have any friends.

308
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:47,724
But I’m okay. I’m used to it.

309
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:49,324
It’s fun to go to new places.

310
00:30:49,550 --> 00:30:53,982
It’s like going on a trip alone.

311
00:30:57,530 --> 00:31:01,013
When you are back in Thailand, you can call me.

312
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:02,862
We’re already crying buddies.

313
00:31:03,430 --> 00:31:05,040
We can also be hanging-out buddies.

314
00:31:06,490 --> 00:31:07,262
Do you mean it?

315
00:31:08,250 --> 00:31:09,040
Yes.

316
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:11,644
I’m Star.

317
00:31:12,410 --> 00:31:13,768
I’m Sera.

318
00:31:14,530 --> 00:31:15,768
Sera?

319
00:31:16,530 --> 00:31:17,973
Your name is cute.

320
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,493
Your name is cute too.

321
00:31:30,650 --> 00:31:31,840
I’m fine.

322
00:31:33,670 --> 00:31:34,720
I’m okay.

323
00:31:39,226 --> 00:31:41,220
I’m going to check out other zones.

324
00:31:46,595 --> 00:31:47,220
This way.

325
00:31:47,386 --> 00:31:48,871
This is my picture.

326
00:31:48,915 --> 00:31:53,208
It’s different from the previous picture because I used oil paints.

327
00:31:53,564 --> 00:31:55,937
It’s called “Crying Whale.”

328
00:31:57,790 --> 00:31:58,915
Is the whale crying?

329
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:00,835
I don’t see any tears.

330
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,044
That’s right.

331
00:32:02,290 --> 00:32:08,320
It’s hurting. But no matter how much it cries, no one knows.

332
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:11,760
Because the tears are invisible in the ocean.

333
00:32:12,026 --> 00:32:13,946
We don’t see its tears.

334
00:32:15,466 --> 00:32:17,460
It doesn’t mean it doesn’t feel anything.

335
00:32:25,777 --> 00:32:27,022
Bye.

336
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:31,057
White.

337
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:33,555
I’m leaving.

338
00:32:33,591 --> 00:32:36,391
Do you have another place to be? Do you want to go home with me?

339
00:32:36,417 --> 00:32:39,831
I have…

340
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:42,444
to hang out with Lune.

341
00:32:44,830 --> 00:32:46,488
Thank you, Nana.

342
00:32:49,130 --> 00:32:52,177
I got to go. Bye.

343
00:32:52,530 --> 00:32:54,275
Bye.

344
00:32:56,570 --> 00:32:59,351
Hey, do you think Nana is acting strange?

345
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:03,822
Can you stop being curious about that and help me find Star?

346
00:33:03,848 --> 00:33:04,542
Huh?

347
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:06,328
Star is not with you?

348
00:33:06,355 --> 00:33:07,164
No.

349
00:33:08,330 --> 00:33:11,804
You two can go home. I’ll go looking for her.

350
00:33:17,742 --> 00:33:20,506
After eating bubble tea, I feel so full.

351
00:33:20,817 --> 00:33:23,777
Star, there you are.

352
00:33:24,088 --> 00:33:25,770
I’ve been looking for you.

353
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:28,168
I didn’t go anywhere.

354
00:33:28,610 --> 00:33:30,871
Sera, this is Ivy, my best friend.

355
00:33:30,897 --> 00:33:33,066
Ivy, this is Sera.

356
00:33:33,351 --> 00:33:34,160
Hello.

357
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:35,351
Hello.

358
00:33:35,555 --> 00:33:39,697
Is she your friend? Why have I never met her before?

359
00:33:42,755 --> 00:33:43,368
I…

360
00:33:43,404 --> 00:33:44,906
Ivy, did you find Star?

361
00:33:47,937 --> 00:33:48,791
Lune.

362
00:33:52,290 --> 00:33:53,208
Sera.

363
00:33:58,190 --> 00:33:59,840
Lune, do you know Sera?

364
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:07,155
Excuse me.

365
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:13,022
What’s wrong with him?

366
00:34:28,170 --> 00:34:30,497
Are you the guy who tries to get close with Sera?

367
00:34:30,533 --> 00:34:31,920
Come out and talk to me.

368
00:34:40,666 --> 00:34:41,448
Lune.

369
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:44,702
Star, why are you still here?

370
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:48,700
I’m here to look for a liar.

371
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:57,706
Someone said he was leaving but he’s still here.

372
00:35:01,950 --> 00:35:05,724
What do you want to say to this liar?

373
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:13,671
He always cheers me up and gives me advice.

374
00:35:16,110 --> 00:35:19,084
If one day, I have a chance to be there for him,

375
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,311
I’m not sure I can do it well.

376
00:35:23,662 --> 00:35:24,853
But I want to give it a try.

377
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:27,822
I hope that I can make him feel better.

378
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:31,600
Thank you.

379
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:42,266
Do you remember the day I had a fight on the overpass?

380
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:46,260
You and the other friends came to help me.

381
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:51,075
Hello, I’m Sera.

382
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:55,857
I just moved back from Switzerland because of my dad’s work.

383
00:35:56,580 --> 00:36:00,382
(Sera was a new student who moved to my junior high in the middle of the semester.)

384
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:20,924
(I saw that she didn’t have any friends. So I went to talk to her.)

385
00:36:21,137 --> 00:36:24,951
Sera, why aren’t you going home?

386
00:36:27,530 --> 00:36:29,520
(But I ended up…)

387
00:36:29,564 --> 00:36:30,471
Get down.

388
00:36:32,328 --> 00:36:33,093
You, pr*ck.

389
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:40,871
Lune.

390
00:36:41,980 --> 00:36:43,333
What happened?

391
00:36:48,110 --> 00:36:49,555
Wait, Lune.

392
00:36:49,937 --> 00:36:51,550
Sera, can you leave me alone?

393
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:57,120
Lune.

394
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:03,262
After that day, I resigned from the school.

395
00:37:03,290 --> 00:37:06,426
I chose to leave everything behind, including Sera.

396
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:12,106
That’s why I can’t face her.

397
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:23,733
To be honest, both you and Sera didn’t do anything wrong.

398
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:28,160
If I were Sera,

399
00:37:29,090 --> 00:37:33,671
I would feel terrible if you chose to leave our good feelings because of those boys.

400
00:37:38,230 --> 00:37:39,840
If you choose to run away again,

401
00:37:41,140 --> 00:37:45,262
you will be stuck with the guilty feeling.

402
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:07,324
Why don’t you talk to Sera?

403
00:38:11,610 --> 00:38:14,986
It may help you overcome your nightmare.

404
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:37,866
Sera.

405
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:45,057
I never knew that you were bullied.

406
00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:46,782
I’m sorry.

407
00:38:47,710 --> 00:38:51,191
You don’t need to apologize. I should be apologizing to you.

408
00:38:51,226 --> 00:38:52,986
You did nothing wrong.

409
00:38:53,690 --> 00:38:58,488
I’m sorry for running away that day and also today.

410
00:38:59,870 --> 00:39:03,422
I’m sorry that I didn’t tell you the truth.

411
00:39:03,955 --> 00:39:04,897
I’m really sorry.

412
00:39:04,924 --> 00:39:06,382
Stop apologizing.

413
00:39:06,826 --> 00:39:08,124
It’s okay.

414
00:39:16,330 --> 00:39:18,773
How is your new school?

415
00:39:21,377 --> 00:39:23,370
It’s good.

416
00:39:26,430 --> 00:39:28,577
You must have good friends there.

417
00:39:28,610 --> 00:39:32,195
I talked to Star. It felt really good.

418
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:34,675
Star was very nice to me.

419
00:39:35,550 --> 00:39:38,524
Your friends’ personalities must be similar to hers.

420
00:39:39,350 --> 00:39:43,280
Star is cute and funny.

421
00:39:43,315 --> 00:39:46,284
She asked me to hang out with her.

422
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:50,266
It’s been a long time since someone asked me to hang out with them.

423
00:40:00,302 --> 00:40:01,164
Lune.

424
00:40:02,110 --> 00:40:02,897
Lune.

425
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:07,360
Are you free next week?

426
00:40:08,150 --> 00:40:09,751
I want to ask you to have dinner at my house.

427
00:40:09,786 --> 00:40:11,493
My parents miss you.

428
00:40:19,635 --> 00:40:21,653
Thank you so much.

429
00:40:21,697 --> 00:40:24,080
If you didn’t help me today, I would be in big trouble.

430
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:25,688
It’s nothing.

431
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:29,182
It was fun. I never did anything like this before.

432
00:40:29,690 --> 00:40:31,982
Do you have any place to be?

433
00:40:32,213 --> 00:40:34,551
Why don’t you go inside? I’ll make you a drink.

434
00:40:34,897 --> 00:40:36,890
I have to go to…

435
00:40:37,820 --> 00:40:39,653
Sh*t. The gallery.

436
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:41,084
I got to go.

437
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:44,088
Wait. I haven’t paid you the wage.

438
00:40:44,133 --> 00:40:45,893
You already bought me the noodles.

439
00:40:45,928 --> 00:40:49,626
No. You need to get paid for your work.

440
00:40:52,490 --> 00:40:54,257
This is your wage for today.

441
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:57,537
What is it?

442
00:40:59,884 --> 00:41:01,093
My wage is you?

443
00:41:03,850 --> 00:41:05,973
Do you want it? I’m the grand prize.

444
00:41:10,115 --> 00:41:12,568
Here is your wage for today.

445
00:41:26,220 --> 00:41:26,960
Hey.

446
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:28,871
What about the gallery?

447
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:33,013
Right. I got to go.

448
00:41:36,693 --> 00:41:38,782
I still don’t know your name.

449
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:45,617
The semester is over.

450
00:41:45,653 --> 00:41:48,266
That’s great. Now, you can stop copying my homework.

451
00:41:48,302 --> 00:41:49,751
I never did such a thing.

452
00:41:49,777 --> 00:41:51,555
You always did it.

453
00:41:51,591 --> 00:41:52,302
What?

454
00:41:52,328 --> 00:41:53,502
Everyone.

455
00:41:54,471 --> 00:41:57,191
We won’t be seeing each other for some time.

456
00:41:57,217 --> 00:41:59,564
What are you going to do during the school break?

457
00:42:00,330 --> 00:42:01,120
White.

458
00:42:02,670 --> 00:42:06,488
I don’t have any plans yet.

459
00:42:06,890 --> 00:42:09,955
Do you want to take a summer course in New Zealand with me?

460
00:42:09,982 --> 00:42:12,462
Huh? Summer course?

461
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:15,084
I actually…

462
00:42:15,137 --> 00:42:18,551
He’s taking a summer course?

463
00:42:18,586 --> 00:42:20,675
I think he’d better make sure that he doesn’t need to repeat a grade.

464
00:42:20,702 --> 00:42:22,426
You have such a foul mouth.

465
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:25,920
Actually, I…

466
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:28,533
I’m allergic to sheepskin.

467
00:42:28,737 --> 00:42:29,440
Huh?

468
00:42:33,493 --> 00:42:35,786
No, I mean…

469
00:42:35,946 --> 00:42:39,751
I’m going to study with Ivy.

470
00:42:43,050 --> 00:42:46,728
Right. We are going to study together.

471
00:42:47,090 --> 00:42:51,066
Okay. See you.

472
00:42:51,564 --> 00:42:52,346
See you.

473
00:42:56,533 --> 00:42:58,340
Do we have to study during the school break?

474
00:42:58,382 --> 00:43:00,515
I told you that Nana is acting strange.

475
00:43:00,551 --> 00:43:01,955
I agree.

476
00:43:02,231 --> 00:43:04,035
She’s barely talked to you before.

477
00:43:04,062 --> 00:43:04,737
Guys.

478
00:43:05,395 --> 00:43:07,297
Let’s go have dinner celebrating the end of the exam.

479
00:43:07,333 --> 00:43:08,071
Sure.

480
00:43:08,311 --> 00:43:10,720
I found an Izakaya restaurant.

481
00:43:11,260 --> 00:43:11,946
It’s amazing.

482
00:43:12,311 --> 00:43:13,940
Shall we go there?

483
00:43:14,266 --> 00:43:15,751
Of course, I’m going.

484
00:43:15,786 --> 00:43:17,520
What about you, Lune? Can you go?

485
00:43:17,555 --> 00:43:22,266
Right. You’re having dinner with your ex’s family.

486
00:43:23,590 --> 00:43:24,826
Shall we go with you?

487
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:27,128
He hasn’t invited you.

488
00:43:28,106 --> 00:43:30,231
Star, let’s go to the Izakaya restaurant together.

489
00:43:30,462 --> 00:43:32,373
I…

490
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:37,920
I got to go. I already have a plan for today.

491
00:43:39,170 --> 00:43:40,684
See you next semester.

492
00:43:40,728 --> 00:43:42,791
Go home safely.

493
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:44,017
See you.

494
00:43:48,100 --> 00:43:49,457
She’s acting strange.

495
00:43:50,580 --> 00:43:53,520
Do you think she’s meeting with her crush?

496
00:43:54,010 --> 00:43:55,617
I don’t know. So what?

497
00:43:56,540 --> 00:43:57,742
It’ll be great if she’s going to meet him.

498
00:43:58,740 --> 00:44:02,133
If it makes her happy, I want her to do it.

499
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:09,680
I only hope that her crush will take better care of her than I could.

500
00:44:14,124 --> 00:44:16,120
But if he hurts her,

501
00:44:18,026 --> 00:44:18,888
I won’t let him get away.

502
00:44:21,244 --> 00:44:22,960
Are you going back to be the troubled kid again?

503
00:44:22,995 --> 00:44:25,173
I’m just like you.

504
00:44:25,217 --> 00:44:26,906
Can you stand watching Star feeling hurt?

505
00:44:29,484 --> 00:44:30,320
You’re right.

506
00:44:35,470 --> 00:44:37,075
Excuse me.

507
00:44:40,930 --> 00:44:41,786
Damn.

508
00:44:42,177 --> 00:44:42,791
Shall we go?

509
00:44:44,330 --> 00:44:45,457
Just the three of us?

510
00:44:49,697 --> 00:44:51,450
Hello, Dad. You aren’t home?

511
00:44:51,724 --> 00:44:54,657
I’m calling to tell you that I won’t have dinner at home today.

512
00:44:55,048 --> 00:44:57,528
(Since you have friends, you are barely home.)

513
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:02,408
I’m not having dinner with my friends. I’m going to Sera’s house.

514
00:45:02,435 --> 00:45:03,831
I was going to ask you to go with me.

515
00:45:03,857 --> 00:45:05,830
(Sera came back to Thailand?)

516
00:45:05,857 --> 00:45:07,128
She came back recently.

517
00:45:07,155 --> 00:45:08,142
I’m hanging up.

518
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:09,040
(Hey.)

519
00:45:10,060 --> 00:45:12,835
(When I said you are barely home, I mean it’s a good thing.)

520
00:45:12,862 --> 00:45:18,542
(You have changed a lot. Is it because of your friends or someone else?)

521
00:45:19,350 --> 00:45:21,893
Whatever, Dad. If you have nothing else, I’m hanging up.

522
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:23,644
Tell Sera I miss her.

523
00:45:24,650 --> 00:45:26,737
Alright. Bye.

524
00:45:54,620 --> 00:45:55,831
Wait a moment, Boy.

525
00:45:56,520 --> 00:45:57,724
Sure, Star.

526
00:46:24,420 --> 00:46:27,208
Can I share the rooftop with you?

527
00:46:29,137 --> 00:46:31,280
I guess I won’t come up here again.

528
00:46:35,155 --> 00:46:37,710
What’s wrong with him?

529
00:46:38,053 --> 00:46:40,275
I’m waiting outside.

530
00:46:45,870 --> 00:46:48,835
Lune and I went to the same junior high school.

531
00:46:49,270 --> 00:46:51,457
One day, he disappeared.

532
00:46:52,750 --> 00:46:58,195
When I see him, I am happy, surprised, and worried.

533
00:46:59,500 --> 00:47:00,675
Worried?

534
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:04,168
Lune and I were dating back then.

535
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:15,573
I told you that I often moved. So I was afraid to befriend someone.

536
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:19,031
Because I knew that I would be parted from them.

537
00:47:20,080 --> 00:47:27,022
If there’s someone who understands me, I can overlook the ending.

538
00:47:28,030 --> 00:47:29,484
Lune was that person.

539
00:47:39,570 --> 00:47:41,884
It would be great if you tell Lune this.

540
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:51,351
If he knew it, he wouldn’t have walked away from you like he did that day and today.

541
00:47:55,697 --> 00:48:00,248
I believe that he has his reason to do that.

542
00:48:00,870 --> 00:48:05,182
Whatever he does, there’s always a reason behind it.

543
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:11,662
I guess Sera is the reason behind your answer.

544
00:48:25,660 --> 00:48:27,660
You haven’t come to my house for a long time.

545
00:48:30,010 --> 00:48:32,977
Your house looks exactly the same.

546
00:48:33,288 --> 00:48:33,857
Yes.

547
00:48:35,850 --> 00:48:38,977
I’m happy to see you again.

548
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:41,440
I never thought that we would meet again.

549
00:48:43,480 --> 00:48:44,355
Sera.

550
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,266
I want to apologize about that day again.

551
00:48:48,930 --> 00:48:51,342
It’s okay.

552
00:48:51,528 --> 00:48:55,582
But from now on, if something happens, you need to tell me.

553
00:48:55,617 --> 00:48:56,933
Don’t run away again.

554
00:48:58,110 --> 00:48:58,960
Run away?

555
00:48:58,995 --> 00:49:02,044
Yes, you ran away from me because of someone else.

556
00:49:04,790 --> 00:49:07,066
I was never mad at you.

557
00:49:09,250 --> 00:49:12,515
I believe you have a reason to do that.

558
00:49:13,770 --> 00:49:19,120
I think your reason must be stronger than our feelings.

559
00:49:19,350 --> 00:49:26,062
From now on, you shouldn’t suppress your feelings because of others.

560
00:49:28,180 --> 00:49:32,977
I asked you to come here today because I have something to tell you.

561
00:49:34,380 --> 00:49:36,000
Actually, I…

562
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:37,920
I…

563
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:40,364
I’m sorry, Sera.

564
00:49:41,950 --> 00:49:42,720
Hello.

565
00:49:42,764 --> 00:49:44,897
(Lune, did Star go to see you?)

566
00:49:45,226 --> 00:49:46,053
No.

567
00:49:46,311 --> 00:49:47,093
Why?

568
00:49:47,404 --> 00:49:50,533
(Star is missing. We are looking for her.)

569
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:51,466
Huh?

570
00:49:51,662 --> 00:49:52,933
What’s wrong, Lune?

571
00:49:53,840 --> 00:49:55,813
Sera, I’m sorry. I got to go.

572
00:49:56,142 --> 00:49:57,810
- Lune, wait. 		- What did you say?

573
00:50:09,297 --> 00:50:09,920
Star.

574
00:50:11,370 --> 00:50:12,240
Star.

575
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:15,244
Boy said Star must be in school.

576
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:17,600
But we looked everywhere but we couldn’t find her.

577
00:50:17,831 --> 00:50:19,893
I think she might go somewhere else.

578
00:50:19,928 --> 00:50:21,120
We should separate and look for her.

579
00:50:22,860 --> 00:50:23,671
Star.

580
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:28,906
Star.

581
00:50:29,048 --> 00:50:30,533
She left her phone in the car.

582
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:32,862
I shouldn’t have left her.

583
00:50:34,220 --> 00:50:34,951
Star.

584
00:50:36,320 --> 00:50:37,093
Star.

585
00:50:40,560 --> 00:50:41,306
Star.

586
00:50:41,653 --> 00:50:42,524
Star.

587
00:50:46,310 --> 00:50:47,208
(That’s right.)

588
00:50:47,244 --> 00:50:48,008
Star.

589
00:50:48,360 --> 00:50:49,733
(I always run away from problems.)

590
00:50:50,940 --> 00:50:52,648
(I run away from my own feelings.)

591
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:55,031
(I run away from the girl I love.)

592
00:50:56,010 --> 00:50:58,488
(I run away from my own heart because of someone else.)

593
00:51:15,290 --> 00:51:16,400
(I can’t find her.)

594
00:51:16,453 --> 00:51:18,808
(I went to every place I thought she would go.)

595
00:51:24,320 --> 00:51:25,733
The place where Star would go.

596
00:51:26,680 --> 00:51:29,226
The place where Star would go.

597
00:51:32,220 --> 00:51:38,328
(But now I know, the thing that I need to run away from is the old me.)

598
00:51:42,990 --> 00:51:44,782
Lune, what are you doing here?

599
00:51:44,835 --> 00:51:47,608
It’s chaotic down there. So I like to come up here.

600
00:51:47,653 --> 00:51:48,355
That’s good.

601
00:51:48,666 --> 00:51:50,350
I knew you would be here.

602
00:51:52,650 --> 00:51:53,226
Star.

603
00:52:09,100 --> 00:52:09,893
Shoot.

604
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:13,982
Ten seconds.

605
00:52:16,977 --> 00:52:17,786
Three.

606
00:52:19,640 --> 00:52:20,586
Two.

607
00:52:21,790 --> 00:52:22,471
One.

608
00:52:27,160 --> 00:52:27,920
Star.

609
00:52:34,220 --> 00:52:35,093
Lune.

610
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:19,333
I’m so worried about you.

611
00:53:27,591 --> 00:53:30,080
Aren’t you supposed to be at Sera’s house?

612
00:53:31,250 --> 00:53:32,168
I went there.

613
00:53:36,900 --> 00:53:38,560
Now, I am very certain.

614
00:53:42,620 --> 00:53:43,208
Huh?

615
00:53:45,324 --> 00:53:47,200
I almost ruined everything.

616
00:53:50,770 --> 00:53:52,906
I almost ran away from my own heart again.

617
00:53:56,160 --> 00:53:59,262
I almost suppressed my feelings because of someone else, just like you said.

618
00:54:03,830 --> 00:54:05,377
I don’t want to make the same mistake.

619
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:11,457
I’m sorry. I lied to you that day.

620
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:20,391
I like you, Star.

621
00:54:26,840 --> 00:54:27,928
Will you be my girlfriend?

622
00:54:48,737 --> 00:54:49,386
Yes.

623
00:55:26,440 --> 00:55:29,217
Why didn’t you bring money when you went to make a delivery?

624
00:55:29,244 --> 00:55:31,137
I help my colleague make the delivery. So I didn’t bring any money.

625
00:55:31,164 --> 00:55:33,057
Do you have free time?

626
00:55:33,093 --> 00:55:34,800
Are you mad that I confessed my feelings to Star?

627
00:55:34,844 --> 00:55:37,706
At least, you weren’t afraid to tell her how you feel.

628
00:55:37,751 --> 00:55:40,417
But I wouldn’t dare to cross the friend zone.

629
00:55:40,444 --> 00:55:40,791
(I like you.)

630
00:55:42,010 --> 00:55:43,244
Ivy likes you?

631
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:47,724
Lune, are you okay if I don’t want to tell Ivy about us yet?

632
00:55:47,768 --> 00:55:49,937
Do you think you can take care of Star?
