1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,977
Thank you so much.

2
00:00:01,004 --> 00:00:02,444
If you didn’t help me today, I would be in big trouble.

3
00:00:02,471 --> 00:00:03,600
This is your wage for today.

4
00:00:03,635 --> 00:00:04,577
I’m Star.

5
00:00:04,586 --> 00:00:05,475
I’m Sera.

6
00:00:05,511 --> 00:00:06,711
We’re already crying buddies.

7
00:00:06,764 --> 00:00:07,884
We can also be hanging-out buddies.

8
00:00:07,911 --> 00:00:08,808
Friend?

9
00:00:08,835 --> 00:00:09,490
Yes.

10
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:11,490
I’ll wait with you.

11
00:00:11,528 --> 00:00:14,906
The prize is this broken-neck goose.

12
00:00:14,933 --> 00:00:15,617
I want it.

13
00:00:15,644 --> 00:00:16,480
- I want to join. - I want to join.

14
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:19,831
I started to wonder why you always step in between me and Star.

15
00:00:19,866 --> 00:00:22,284
Are you having feelings…

16
00:00:22,506 --> 00:00:23,715
What did you do?

17
00:00:23,911 --> 00:00:25,075
I like you, Star.

18
00:00:25,324 --> 00:00:26,844
I like someone else.

19
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:29,475
You did well. You weren’t afraid to tell her your feelings.

20
00:00:29,528 --> 00:00:30,195
Unlike me.

21
00:00:30,222 --> 00:00:31,591
Don’t tell me that you…

22
00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:37,848
Being an athlete is so tiring.

23
00:00:38,062 --> 00:00:39,840
We have to practice even during the school break.

24
00:00:40,302 --> 00:00:41,137
I agree.

25
00:00:41,608 --> 00:00:42,951
I feel light-headed.

26
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:46,800
Here.

27
00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:51,751
Ivy, you always read my mind.

28
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:53,111
Thanks.

29
00:01:00,328 --> 00:01:02,577
(Is your practice over? How is it?)

30
00:01:03,178 --> 00:01:06,120
(It’s over. I’m starving.)

31
00:01:06,168 --> 00:01:07,475
(Let’s go eat mala hotpot.)

32
00:01:07,511 --> 00:01:08,968
(I’ll wait for you at the school’s entrance.)

33
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:16,737
Star, do you remember the movie you said you wanted to watch?

34
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:18,106
Yes.

35
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:20,026
It’s currently in the theatre.

36
00:01:20,053 --> 00:01:20,942
Do you want to see it?

37
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,146
Today?

38
00:01:23,173 --> 00:01:23,822
Yes.

39
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:27,715
I already have plans.

40
00:01:27,946 --> 00:01:28,871
Again?

41
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:31,324
Why are you often unavailable these days?

42
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:35,875
It’s not that often.

43
00:01:45,075 --> 00:01:47,070
Can we go watch it another day?

44
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,071
Sure.

45
00:01:56,890 --> 00:01:58,124
I got to go.

46
00:02:01,751 --> 00:02:02,391
Bye.

47
00:02:52,631 --> 00:02:54,390
(When I first befriended Star)

48
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:58,568
(I never imagined that we would go through so many things together.)

49
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:01,448
(The next thing I know,)

50
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:05,564
(Star became my only close friend.)

51
00:03:11,448 --> 00:03:14,720
(I love you, Ivy. Let’s stay friends forever.)

52
00:03:17,653 --> 00:03:19,902
(I guess I can only be her close friend.)

53
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:26,728
Can you write a farewell message for me?

54
00:03:26,764 --> 00:03:28,222
Why do I have to do it?

55
00:03:28,257 --> 00:03:30,728
We’ll attend the same high school anyway.

56
00:03:30,773 --> 00:03:34,133
No. This is a memory of our junior high school life.

57
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,075
Write it for me.

58
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:40,044
I don’t know what to write.

59
00:03:40,071 --> 00:03:42,284
Write anything that you want to tell me.

60
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:12,586
I’ll keep this shirt well.

61
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:14,675
Because it’s full of messages from my special friends.

62
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:19,235
Who are they?

63
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:27,822
Master Mac, Miss Ploy, Eclair, Nana.

64
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,573
And the person who is writing right now is very special to me.

65
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:35,564
The only one missing is a lover because I don’t have one.

66
00:04:38,488 --> 00:04:40,480
I can be your lover.

67
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:46,142
How? I can’t picture it.

68
00:04:46,311 --> 00:04:49,493
Having you as my friend is the best thing.

69
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:06,826
(I like you.)

70
00:05:08,017 --> 00:05:10,010
Didn’t you say you didn’t know what to write?

71
00:05:10,551 --> 00:05:13,395
Your message is longer than the one I wrote to you.

72
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,831
Done.

73
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:21,902
Thanks.

74
00:06:51,671 --> 00:06:53,742
I ate a lot today.

75
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,457
This restaurant is great.

76
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,391
If Ivy went there, she would love it.

77
00:07:00,657 --> 00:07:02,746
You should take Ivy to the restaurant.

78
00:07:07,413 --> 00:07:11,280
She might be suspicious of whom I went to the restaurant with.

79
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,755
You haven’t told her about us?

80
00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:20,017
No, I haven’t.

81
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:26,026
I barely have any secrets with Ivy.

82
00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:28,524
But about this,

83
00:07:29,715 --> 00:07:31,710
I don’t want to hurt her feelings.

84
00:07:32,890 --> 00:07:33,831
Hurt her feelings?

85
00:07:38,568 --> 00:07:40,560
I know that Ivy…

86
00:07:47,111 --> 00:07:49,760
(I like you.)

87
00:07:59,413 --> 00:08:00,195
Star.

88
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:04,302
You can’t get to sleep?

89
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:11,662
I have something to tell you.

90
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,093
I…

91
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,053
Ivy.

92
00:08:21,010 --> 00:08:22,702
I also have something to tell you.

93
00:08:25,210 --> 00:08:31,528
Ivy, do you know that you are the only friend I feel comfortable to be with?

94
00:08:35,244 --> 00:08:36,986
Don’t stop being my friend.

95
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,902
What are you saying?

96
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:48,640
This is strange.

97
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:52,640
But you are right.

98
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:59,413
Having you as my friend is the best thing.

99
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:41,040
Huh? Ivy has feelings for you?

100
00:09:42,684 --> 00:09:43,582
Yes.

101
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:47,582
I have been pretending that I didn’t know.

102
00:09:48,684 --> 00:09:50,680
I don’t know how to tell her.

103
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:56,577
I don’t want to make her feel awkward or hurt her feelings.

104
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:07,528
Lune, will it be okay if I don’t tell Ivy about us?

105
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:14,160
Okay, I get it.

106
00:10:14,951 --> 00:10:17,288
I don’t know how to tell White either.

107
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:21,280
I don’t want to hurt his feelings.

108
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:31,893
I planned to tell him about us when we came down from the rooftop that day

109
00:10:31,928 --> 00:10:32,720
but....

110
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,591
White, I have something to tell you.

111
00:10:35,626 --> 00:10:37,590
Me, too.

112
00:10:37,768 --> 00:10:42,160
Do you remember that I told you I would try to go back to be Star’s friend?

113
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:44,791
Yes.

114
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:51,955
What happened today made me realize that I really care about her.

115
00:10:53,430 --> 00:10:55,600
Although she said she only sees me as a friend,

116
00:10:56,590 --> 00:10:58,026
my feelings for her haven’t changed.

117
00:11:06,124 --> 00:11:08,020
I think it will take a long time…

118
00:11:11,777 --> 00:11:13,137
for me to get over her.

119
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:22,124
What did you want to tell me?

120
00:11:24,462 --> 00:11:25,351
Nothing.

121
00:11:26,106 --> 00:11:27,137
What?

122
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:35,706
Like they said, constant dripping wears away the stone.

123
00:11:37,031 --> 00:11:40,844
I’ll be the constant dripping to wear away the star.

124
00:12:06,933 --> 00:12:11,404
Let’s keep our dating a secret for now.

125
00:12:12,010 --> 00:12:14,355
We’ll tell them when they are ready.

126
00:12:19,111 --> 00:12:21,110
At least, let’s wait until the school break is over.

127
00:12:22,071 --> 00:12:22,817
Sure.

128
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:27,955
So this is our secret on a summer night?

129
00:12:28,284 --> 00:12:28,933
Huh?

130
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:34,906
It’s a secret between the star and the moon.

131
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:49,973
 Love is love, no need to question why

132
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,382
 No need to hesitate, just listen to your heart’s cry

133
00:12:54,417 --> 00:12:59,262
 Hold my hand, let your heart tell you what’s right

134
00:13:16,968 --> 00:13:17,866
A wizard?

135
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,951
(I forgot to bring the change again.)

136
00:13:20,986 --> 00:13:22,782
(Can I pay you back with something else?)

137
00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:27,066
What’s wrong with me?

138
00:13:42,151 --> 00:13:43,060
Stupefy.

139
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:47,937
Damn.

140
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,524
My spell is working.

141
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:52,453
Huh?

142
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:54,453
What did you say?

143
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:05,040
These are for table 2.

144
00:14:14,728 --> 00:14:16,684
Here are your drinks.

145
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:19,760
Heycinedra.

146
00:14:20,017 --> 00:14:20,942
Please enjoy.

147
00:14:26,010 --> 00:14:30,115
(I ordered a drink for you. Hurry up. I’m so hungry.)

148
00:14:30,142 --> 00:14:31,635
(I’m almost there.)

149
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:36,897
Star.

150
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:39,680
Sera.

151
00:14:39,715 --> 00:14:40,622
Hello.

152
00:14:40,808 --> 00:14:42,284
Star, did you come here alone?

153
00:14:42,702 --> 00:14:44,186
Can I sit with you?

154
00:14:46,071 --> 00:14:47,777
Sure.

155
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:51,715
Why did you order two glasses? Do you like the drink?

156
00:14:53,330 --> 00:14:54,177
Sera.

157
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,657
Oh, Lune.

158
00:14:57,330 --> 00:14:58,924
Did you come to meet her?

159
00:14:59,890 --> 00:15:00,897
Umm…

160
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:03,164
That’s right.

161
00:15:03,191 --> 00:15:05,706
We get lonely during the school break.

162
00:15:05,733 --> 00:15:07,937
So we came to hang out together.

163
00:15:08,284 --> 00:15:10,542
We invited other friends as well.

164
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:12,960
Yes.

165
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,791
White is always late.

166
00:15:16,328 --> 00:15:18,764
Is this during your school break?

167
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:20,640
Yes.

168
00:15:20,933 --> 00:15:22,391
Do you want to go to a waterpark?

169
00:15:22,426 --> 00:15:23,511
My family owns it.

170
00:15:24,168 --> 00:15:25,510
I…

171
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:28,035
Don’t think you’re bothering me.

172
00:15:28,062 --> 00:15:31,857
I want to go to a waterpark with friends. I never did it.

173
00:15:35,850 --> 00:15:36,702
I…

174
00:15:36,728 --> 00:15:40,257
If you don’t want to go, it’s okay.

175
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:52,062
I want to go.

176
00:15:53,831 --> 00:15:55,830
Let’s go together, all of us.

177
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:56,720
Right?

178
00:15:57,900 --> 00:16:00,400
Let’s invite all of your friends.

179
00:16:00,435 --> 00:16:02,240
It’ll be fun if we go with a large group of friends.

180
00:16:02,844 --> 00:16:04,840
I’ll call my dad and tell him now.

181
00:16:12,382 --> 00:16:13,973
Waterpark?

182
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:14,728
Yes.

183
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:17,555
Lune and I ran into Sera at the café.

184
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:19,288
So Sera asked us to go with her.

185
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:22,897
Lune said he was going to invite White and Jewel too.

186
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:25,333
Ivy, do you want to go with us?

187
00:16:25,368 --> 00:16:26,426
Of course.

188
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:28,560
If you go, I’ll go.

189
00:16:28,604 --> 00:16:31,210
I won’t let you go with those guys alone.

190
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:38,977
Did you go to the café with Lune?

191
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:43,591
I…

192
00:16:46,648 --> 00:16:48,640
I ran into him.

193
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:50,275
Really?

194
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:54,355
Yes.

195
00:16:57,900 --> 00:16:58,888
I believe you.

196
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:06,728
How are things between you and that person?

197
00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:10,488
Who are you talking about?

198
00:17:10,524 --> 00:17:13,653
The person who made you cry the other day.

199
00:17:14,830 --> 00:17:15,973
Oh, that person.

200
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:21,546
It’s nothing.

201
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:26,248
Okay.

202
00:17:26,417 --> 00:17:30,915
I just wonder if that person can take care of you for me.

203
00:17:32,737 --> 00:17:33,840
Ivy.

204
00:17:33,893 --> 00:17:37,253
If he can’t take good care of you, I’ll kill him.

205
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:40,186
If he makes you sad again, wait and see what I’ll do to him.

206
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,324
Thank you.

207
00:17:56,666 --> 00:17:59,320
What are you doing here during the school break?

208
00:18:00,088 --> 00:18:01,320
I came to get something.

209
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:06,720
What are you doing here?

210
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:10,488
Oh.

211
00:18:11,910 --> 00:18:13,511
I came to get something as well.

212
00:18:13,546 --> 00:18:15,004
I saw the room was messy.

213
00:18:15,377 --> 00:18:17,000
I also have a lot of things on my mind.

214
00:18:17,048 --> 00:18:18,151
So I’m tidying up the room.

215
00:18:27,370 --> 00:18:33,004
I just noticed that each chair reflects the personality of its owner.

216
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:37,822
What are you rambling about?

217
00:18:37,866 --> 00:18:39,146
Take it and clean the room.

218
00:18:41,030 --> 00:18:45,173
Cleaning helps calm you and stop you from overthinking.

219
00:18:46,330 --> 00:18:48,213
When did I say I’m overthinking?

220
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,870
You forced the broomstick into my hand.

221
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:06,657
Ivy.

222
00:19:09,093 --> 00:19:11,090
I never seriously asked you about this.

223
00:19:13,790 --> 00:19:16,106
Were you mad that I confessed my feelings to Star?

224
00:19:18,311 --> 00:19:19,866
Why would I be mad at you?

225
00:19:23,288 --> 00:19:25,280
How did you have the guts to confess your feelings?

226
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:29,457
I just…

227
00:19:34,370 --> 00:19:35,973
I thought I had a shot at it.

228
00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:54,711
At least, you were brave enough to tell her how you feel.

229
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:56,435
Unlike me.

230
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,097
I don’t dare to say anything to her.

231
00:20:04,311 --> 00:20:06,213
It doesn’t matter how I feel.

232
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:11,262
I will never dare to cross the friend zone.

233
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:25,111
You know what?

234
00:20:28,542 --> 00:20:31,520
When I was young, I couldn’t poop anywhere but home.

235
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:35,404
Once, I tried to hold it but I ended up pooping my pants.

236
00:20:36,170 --> 00:20:37,111
Damn.

237
00:20:37,502 --> 00:20:38,951
Why are you telling me this?

238
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:42,506
Everyone has something they are afraid to do.

239
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:44,106
Damn.

240
00:20:51,768 --> 00:20:53,760
No one knew it?

241
00:20:56,900 --> 00:21:01,102
None of your friends knew that you pooped your pants?

242
00:21:02,730 --> 00:21:04,008
No.

243
00:21:04,490 --> 00:21:08,986
Come on. Your poop had to have some smell.

244
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:15,804
Go clean over there.

245
00:21:20,430 --> 00:21:24,408
(Everyone, don’t forget our waterpark date with Sera this Saturday.)

246
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:26,853
(I’m definitely going but I need to bulk up first.)

247
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:27,982
(I’m going too.)

248
00:21:28,017 --> 00:21:30,826
(Damn, I’m going to see Ivy wearing a bikini.)

249
00:21:30,853 --> 00:21:32,204
(Will my eyes go blind?)

250
00:21:32,231 --> 00:21:35,013
(They will go blind because I’ll hit them.)

251
00:21:38,026 --> 00:21:39,022
Lune, are you ready?

252
00:21:39,630 --> 00:21:41,644
Just pick the one that you like.

253
00:21:41,671 --> 00:21:43,093
I can go wait for you outside.

254
00:21:43,128 --> 00:21:45,546
No, I want you to help me pick it.

255
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:47,351
Ready?

256
00:21:47,582 --> 00:21:49,822
Three, two, one.

257
00:21:57,660 --> 00:21:58,648
It looks good.

258
00:21:58,693 --> 00:22:00,640
Let’s take this one. I’ll pay for it.

259
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:03,413
I thought you would act like an overprotective boyfriend.

260
00:22:04,770 --> 00:22:06,275
Actually, I am.

261
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,328
But I want you to choose what you want.

262
00:22:10,346 --> 00:22:11,688
Can I try one more?

263
00:22:11,970 --> 00:22:12,568
Huh?

264
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:14,986
But you already tried five ones.

265
00:22:15,013 --> 00:22:16,613
I have three more to try on.

266
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,471
It’s like you read my mind.

267
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:28,808
Ivy.

268
00:22:28,844 --> 00:22:30,062
What are you doing here?

269
00:22:30,088 --> 00:22:31,360
I came here to have lunch with my mom.

270
00:22:31,404 --> 00:22:33,733
I want to buy a new swimsuit.

271
00:22:33,768 --> 00:22:34,817
So I came into the shop.

272
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,431
What a small world.

273
00:22:37,475 --> 00:22:41,066
This is the shop we always come together.

274
00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:45,626
Right.

275
00:22:46,871 --> 00:22:48,870
Is there any swimsuits that caught your eye?

276
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:51,813
This one is pretty.

277
00:22:55,573 --> 00:22:57,288
(Go away. Go to the fitting room.)

278
00:22:57,911 --> 00:22:58,675
(Go hiding.)

279
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:00,222
(Go away.)

280
00:23:02,044 --> 00:23:02,906
(Go away.)

281
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:07,315
(Ivy.)

282
00:23:09,310 --> 00:23:10,631
(Ivy.)

283
00:23:17,102 --> 00:23:17,786
What are you doing?

284
00:23:22,382 --> 00:23:25,315
This swimsuit looks good, right?

285
00:23:26,510 --> 00:23:28,053
You have such good taste.

286
00:23:28,730 --> 00:23:29,804
I’ll take it.

287
00:23:29,831 --> 00:23:31,173
Let’s go try it on.

288
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:35,920
This shop doesn’t have many swimsuits to choose from.

289
00:23:35,973 --> 00:23:36,960
Let’s go to another shop.

290
00:23:37,004 --> 00:23:40,062
It’s okay. This shop has the largest collections.

291
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:42,320
Let’s go try it on. Take it and follow me.

292
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:52,222
Can I try it first?

293
00:23:54,897 --> 00:23:56,000
What Ivy is doing here?

294
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,564
I don’t know.

295
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:00,737
Star, are you done? Can I see it?

296
00:24:00,764 --> 00:24:02,924
I might want to buy it too. Let me see.

297
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:03,911
What should we do?

298
00:24:04,373 --> 00:24:05,902
Are you done? Why do you take so long?

299
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:07,520
Wait.

300
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:12,595
Okay.

301
00:24:15,031 --> 00:24:15,777
What should we do?

302
00:24:16,773 --> 00:24:17,164
Turn around.

303
00:24:17,191 --> 00:24:17,555
Huh?

304
00:24:18,506 --> 00:24:20,124
Turn around. Come on.

305
00:24:31,230 --> 00:24:32,106
How is it?

306
00:24:32,257 --> 00:24:33,128
It looks good, right?

307
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,755
Let’s wear it together.

308
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:39,475
Why are you in such a hurry?

309
00:24:56,140 --> 00:24:57,040
Let’s go.

310
00:24:57,226 --> 00:24:58,640
Let’s wear it together.

311
00:24:58,684 --> 00:24:59,351
Come on.

312
00:24:59,964 --> 00:25:00,488
Wait.

313
00:25:00,515 --> 00:25:01,440
Come on.

314
00:25:16,650 --> 00:25:17,742
Let’s buy it.

315
00:25:18,017 --> 00:25:18,782
Here.

316
00:25:30,010 --> 00:25:30,862
Excuse me.

317
00:25:31,511 --> 00:25:33,768
I want to try it first. I don’t want to get the wrong size.

318
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:36,960
Wait.

319
00:25:37,288 --> 00:25:38,213
Wait.

320
00:25:41,510 --> 00:25:44,542
The fitting room is available.

321
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:47,146
Go try it on.

322
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,120
Okay.

323
00:25:49,448 --> 00:25:50,666
Try it on.

324
00:26:06,910 --> 00:26:08,506
Don’t you think that guy is acting strange?

325
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:11,155
No, he’s not.

326
00:26:11,342 --> 00:26:12,977
We should try the product before we buy it.

327
00:26:13,004 --> 00:26:14,586
What are you doing?

328
00:26:14,613 --> 00:26:16,017
You’re funny.

329
00:26:16,350 --> 00:26:17,893
Take it off.

330
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,431
My mom is calling me.

331
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:22,888
Are you going home after this?

332
00:26:22,915 --> 00:26:24,204
I’m leaving soon.

333
00:26:24,221 --> 00:26:25,468
You should go back to your mom.

334
00:26:25,617 --> 00:26:26,194
Okay.

335
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:28,274
Thank you.

336
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:29,817
Bye. See you.

337
00:26:29,834 --> 00:26:30,497
Bye.

338
00:26:32,508 --> 00:26:33,508
Thank you.

339
00:26:42,090 --> 00:26:43,542
(Okay.)

340
00:26:55,377 --> 00:26:56,125
Where do you want to go next?

341
00:26:59,450 --> 00:27:00,188
Let’s go that way.

342
00:27:20,291 --> 00:27:22,180
Damn.

343
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:24,885
How many businesses does Sera’s family own?

344
00:27:25,182 --> 00:27:26,474
She is so rich that I got goosebumps.

345
00:27:26,690 --> 00:27:27,742
Hello, everyone.

346
00:27:27,767 --> 00:27:28,916
Sera.

347
00:27:29,170 --> 00:27:33,003
This is my friend. His name is White.

348
00:27:34,181 --> 00:27:36,727
Make yourself comfortable. You can play everything.

349
00:27:37,390 --> 00:27:39,854
Star, didn’t you tell me there would be five of you?

350
00:27:40,109 --> 00:27:41,389
Where is the other one?

351
00:27:43,770 --> 00:27:46,712
Jewel can’t come because he…

352
00:27:49,345 --> 00:27:51,340
This is my chance to show off my figure.

353
00:27:52,050 --> 00:27:54,276
I need to bulk up.

354
00:28:00,830 --> 00:28:02,174
He injured his foot.

355
00:28:02,378 --> 00:28:03,672
His wound needs to be kept away from water.

356
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:05,010
So he can’t come.

357
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:06,749
That’s too bad.

358
00:28:06,770 --> 00:28:08,850
You don’t need to feel bad for him.

359
00:28:08,872 --> 00:28:10,130
It was his fault.

360
00:28:10,850 --> 00:28:12,007
Let’s go play.

361
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:13,323
Come on. Let’s go.

362
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:16,589
I’ll carry it for you.

363
00:28:19,207 --> 00:28:21,200
It’s okay. I’ll carry it for her.

364
00:28:22,312 --> 00:28:23,229
Thanks, Ivy.

365
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:27,236
Hey.

366
00:28:29,476 --> 00:28:31,585
Do you really think you can take care of Star?

367
00:29:00,770 --> 00:29:01,730
Stop spinning it.

368
00:29:02,247 --> 00:29:03,425
Let me get off.

369
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:05,461
You can’t.

370
00:29:05,490 --> 00:29:06,050
Why?

371
00:29:06,618 --> 00:29:07,905
You are too short. You will be drowned.

372
00:29:11,483 --> 00:29:12,138
Ouch.

373
00:29:12,970 --> 00:29:13,578
Star.

374
00:29:13,592 --> 00:29:14,043
Star.

375
00:29:14,072 --> 00:29:14,574
Star.

376
00:29:20,130 --> 00:29:20,800
Star.

377
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:25,883
It’s okay.

378
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:29,076
It’ll get better after cleaning the wound.

379
00:29:30,370 --> 00:29:32,167
I’ll take you to the bathroom.

380
00:29:37,890 --> 00:29:38,923
We’re going to the lady’s room.

381
00:29:39,098 --> 00:29:40,218
You don’t need to follow us.

382
00:29:49,425 --> 00:29:51,420
It’s better to clean it with saline.

383
00:29:51,534 --> 00:29:53,420
I’ll go get it.

384
00:29:58,225 --> 00:30:00,220
I can do it myself, Sera.

385
00:30:01,630 --> 00:30:03,992
It’s okay. Let me do it.

386
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:20,632
Your hands are so gentle.

387
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:23,621
Really?

388
00:30:24,540 --> 00:30:27,505
There’s another person whose hands are gentler than mine.

389
00:30:28,810 --> 00:30:32,574
Do you know that Lune’s hands are very gentle?

390
00:30:34,290 --> 00:30:37,570
When I was young and got injured, Lune was the one who dressed my wound.

391
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:41,920
If he did it, I was not afraid that it would hurt.

392
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:46,385
Is that so?

393
00:30:48,036 --> 00:30:50,030
I never knew it before.

394
00:30:56,500 --> 00:31:01,090
Although Lune looks reserved, he’s actually very kind.

395
00:31:06,050 --> 00:31:12,632
Do you know that he and I promised to get married when we were adults?

396
00:31:17,287 --> 00:31:18,000
Really?

397
00:31:40,930 --> 00:31:42,749
I feel so bummed.

398
00:31:43,650 --> 00:31:46,356
This is peach tea with konjac crystal pearl.

399
00:31:46,385 --> 00:31:47,687
Thank you.

400
00:31:48,487 --> 00:31:49,214
It’s refreshing.

401
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:53,505
Do you want anything else?

402
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:57,629
Huh?

403
00:31:58,152 --> 00:32:00,872
Be careful. You’re spilling it.

404
00:32:08,712 --> 00:32:11,170
Do you want snacks?

405
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:14,370
It’s okay.

406
00:32:14,676 --> 00:32:16,996
We made chicken noodles for lunch.

407
00:32:17,018 --> 00:32:18,676
Please taste it.

408
00:32:21,250 --> 00:32:22,581
I’ll add the condiments for you.

409
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:27,927
You like your food to be a bit sweet.

410
00:32:31,025 --> 00:32:31,585
Give it to me.

411
00:32:45,796 --> 00:32:47,112
Taste it.

412
00:32:51,770 --> 00:32:55,061
Do you want me to add the condiments for you?

413
00:32:57,701 --> 00:32:58,523
It’s okay.

414
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:01,476
I’ll do it myself.

415
00:33:01,665 --> 00:33:02,538
Alright.

416
00:33:04,632 --> 00:33:06,887
My secret ingredient, chili sauce.

417
00:33:08,170 --> 00:33:08,705
How is it?

418
00:33:09,163 --> 00:33:10,014
It’s delicious.

419
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:12,618
Auntie.

420
00:33:12,647 --> 00:33:13,403
What?

421
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:15,120
Can you get me chili sauce?

422
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:16,698
Sure.

423
00:33:16,712 --> 00:33:19,120
Don’t go anywhere.

424
00:33:19,149 --> 00:33:23,170
A maid in the kitchen told me that a stranger is standing in front of the house.

425
00:33:23,214 --> 00:33:25,170
I’ll go check it.

426
00:33:25,730 --> 00:33:28,109
I’ll be right back. Don’t go anywhere.

427
00:33:30,620 --> 00:33:31,549
A stranger?

428
00:33:40,072 --> 00:33:41,141
Star, how are you?

429
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:44,196
It’s just a small wound.

430
00:33:44,225 --> 00:33:45,403
I’m ready to get back in action.

431
00:33:45,990 --> 00:33:47,643
Then let’s go.

432
00:33:48,530 --> 00:33:49,469
Come on, Lune.

433
00:33:55,790 --> 00:33:56,829
Sera, watch out.

434
00:33:59,140 --> 00:34:02,487
Do you know that Lune’s hands are very gentle?

435
00:34:02,730 --> 00:34:05,280
(Sera, watch out.)

436
00:34:12,610 --> 00:34:13,665
Star, do you want some water?

437
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:33,709
Are your hands that gentle?

438
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:39,127
If you don’t want it, you can just tell me.

439
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:04,320
Star.

440
00:35:05,210 --> 00:35:06,203
Do you want to ride on the swim ring?

441
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:08,130
No, I don’t.

442
00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:23,847
Auntie. So who is the stranger in front of the house?

443
00:35:23,883 --> 00:35:25,280
He’s a delivery man from the café.

444
00:35:25,316 --> 00:35:27,690
He forgot to bring the change.

445
00:35:27,723 --> 00:35:29,490
So I came back into the house to get my phone.

446
00:35:30,310 --> 00:35:31,192
Excuse me.

447
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:36,138
Forgot to bring the change.

448
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:40,414
It’s you.

449
00:35:41,789 --> 00:35:43,780
When you make a delivery,

450
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:45,780
why don’t you bring money for change?

451
00:35:46,072 --> 00:35:48,138
I asked the manager to get off work early today.

452
00:35:48,450 --> 00:35:50,087
I’m making the delivery for another staff.

453
00:35:50,116 --> 00:35:51,250
So I didn’t bring the change.

454
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:54,560
Is this your house?

455
00:35:55,610 --> 00:35:56,254
Yes.

456
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:58,974
It’s like the mansion I see in drama series.

457
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:00,400
Really?

458
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:02,370
I think it’s a bit small.

459
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:09,847
What happened to your foot?

460
00:36:11,250 --> 00:36:12,320
It was a small accident.

461
00:36:13,030 --> 00:36:14,269
Why did you run to see me?

462
00:36:16,509 --> 00:36:17,912
So you get off work?

463
00:36:18,690 --> 00:36:19,774
Yes.

464
00:36:20,130 --> 00:36:22,370
A technician is coming to repair the AC in my room.

465
00:36:22,749 --> 00:36:24,370
Do you still have time before the appointment?

466
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:38,647
Star.

467
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:42,923
What’s wrong? Does your wound hurt?

468
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:48,749
No, I’m fine.

469
00:36:50,020 --> 00:36:53,723
Anyone can tell that something is wrong.

470
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:03,367
Lune, I may sound unreasonable.

471
00:37:04,465 --> 00:37:06,460
But can I ask you something?

472
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:17,360
Sera told me that you made a promise to her when you were young,

473
00:37:18,260 --> 00:37:19,643
that you two would get married.

474
00:37:23,860 --> 00:37:26,247
Yes, but we made the promise when we were young.

475
00:37:26,269 --> 00:37:27,316
We weren’t serious about it.

476
00:37:28,140 --> 00:37:28,785
Really?

477
00:37:34,780 --> 00:37:35,592
Are you jealous?

478
00:37:37,190 --> 00:37:39,876
No, I’m not.

479
00:37:40,420 --> 00:37:41,803
I’m not jealous at all.

480
00:37:42,590 --> 00:37:43,483
I just…

481
00:37:45,830 --> 00:37:48,640
Sera is cute and kind.

482
00:37:49,585 --> 00:37:51,580
She knows you really well.

483
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:56,632
I’m worried that your feelings for her might rekindle.

484
00:37:59,770 --> 00:38:01,141
Don’t you trust me?

485
00:38:01,730 --> 00:38:02,770
It’s not like that.

486
00:38:03,076 --> 00:38:04,210
But I…

487
00:38:54,210 --> 00:38:56,305
Lune, what are you doing?

488
00:38:56,734 --> 00:38:57,949
They might see it.

489
00:38:59,970 --> 00:39:00,872
They won’t.

490
00:39:01,410 --> 00:39:02,712
We did it underwater.

491
00:39:06,545 --> 00:39:08,710
I know that you are worried about me and Sera.

492
00:39:09,870 --> 00:39:10,385
But…

493
00:39:11,410 --> 00:39:12,807
We were very young back then.

494
00:39:15,270 --> 00:39:15,789
I…

495
00:39:17,185 --> 00:39:19,207
I can’t turn back time to change my past.

496
00:39:20,610 --> 00:39:24,021
But I want you to know that now I have only you.

497
00:39:24,261 --> 00:39:25,898
I don’t have anyone else on my mind.

498
00:39:27,738 --> 00:39:33,723
No doubt, no fear, no flight

499
00:39:33,745 --> 00:39:35,796
If you don’t believe me, I can reassure you again.

500
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:37,840
I believe you.

501
00:39:37,876 --> 00:39:39,061
No.

502
00:39:39,236 --> 00:39:40,552
No. Stop it.

503
00:39:40,589 --> 00:39:42,407
I said I believe you. Go away.

504
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:45,512
Stop it.

505
00:39:52,180 --> 00:39:53,738
What do you want me to do?

506
00:39:54,650 --> 00:39:55,687
I’m working on the puzzle set.

507
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:57,410
I haven’t finished it

508
00:39:57,687 --> 00:39:58,843
Can you help me?

509
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:02,254
But I haven’t done it before.

510
00:40:02,980 --> 00:40:03,658
It’s not hard.

511
00:40:03,934 --> 00:40:04,676
I’ll teach you.

512
00:40:05,030 --> 00:40:06,007
Do you see this piece?

513
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:08,101
Can you look for it in the pile?

514
00:40:08,138 --> 00:40:10,400
I’ll attach these two pieces to it.

515
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:11,992
Okay.

516
00:40:18,181 --> 00:40:19,789
I found it.

517
00:40:21,330 --> 00:40:23,149
Okay, put it down.

518
00:40:23,980 --> 00:40:26,298
It might be a bit hard to attach these two to it.

519
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,014
You need to push hard.

520
00:40:28,610 --> 00:40:29,970
I’ll attach this one. You do the other.

521
00:40:30,152 --> 00:40:31,425
We need to do it at the same time.

522
00:40:33,629 --> 00:40:35,620
One, two, three.

523
00:40:38,750 --> 00:40:39,738
Why does it not fit?

524
00:40:40,770 --> 00:40:41,330
Push harder.

525
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:48,494
It doesn’t go in.

526
00:40:54,538 --> 00:40:55,934
Are you sure it’s the right hole?

527
00:40:55,970 --> 00:40:56,887
Why it doesn’t go in?

528
00:40:57,640 --> 00:40:59,141
There’s only one hole.

529
00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:00,400
Push harder.

530
00:41:09,390 --> 00:41:10,305
I got it.

531
00:41:27,090 --> 00:41:29,338
Why are you doing this difficult thing?

532
00:41:32,970 --> 00:41:36,160
Why don’t you buy a complete model or hire someone to do it?

533
00:41:36,530 --> 00:41:38,363
You can afford it.

534
00:41:39,650 --> 00:41:41,163
Then it would not be fun.

535
00:41:41,454 --> 00:41:42,443
If I hired someone to do it,

536
00:41:43,789 --> 00:41:45,069
The model would have no meaning to me.

537
00:41:46,050 --> 00:41:49,730
For me, this model is a memory.

538
00:41:51,010 --> 00:41:52,363
When time passes and I look back,

539
00:41:53,870 --> 00:41:57,432
I’ll remember what happened in my life when I built it.

540
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:02,050
I’ll remember the feelings and people who helped me build it.

541
00:42:06,740 --> 00:42:10,370
So you will think of me when you look at it, right?

542
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:18,145
I don’t know.

543
00:42:19,540 --> 00:42:21,912
Now, you see that I don’t use money to buy everything.

544
00:42:21,941 --> 00:42:23,258
Right.

545
00:42:24,196 --> 00:42:26,190
I only put effort into the things that I like.

546
00:42:34,603 --> 00:42:36,600
Don’t you have to go meet the AC technician?

547
00:42:37,490 --> 00:42:40,160
I already postponed the appointment.

548
00:42:40,203 --> 00:42:41,643
I can use a fan tonight.

549
00:42:41,796 --> 00:42:43,709
The weather is not that hot.

550
00:42:44,741 --> 00:42:45,869
It’s so damn hot.

551
00:42:46,385 --> 00:42:48,380
You should call the technician to fix your AC now.

552
00:42:49,730 --> 00:42:53,927
If I leave, I won’t be in the castle.

553
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:10,589
If I stay here, I can enjoy the AC for free.

554
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:30,850
Excuse me.

555
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:33,549
Did you come here alone?

556
00:43:33,876 --> 00:43:34,261
Umm…

557
00:43:34,283 --> 00:43:35,163
Can I sit with you?

558
00:43:36,580 --> 00:43:37,127
What?

559
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:46,196
What? I’m going to help her.

560
00:43:46,334 --> 00:43:47,127
Just wait and see.

561
00:43:58,152 --> 00:43:59,120
Damn.

562
00:44:17,470 --> 00:44:18,072
Move.

563
00:44:27,883 --> 00:44:28,814
Can I take a ball?

564
00:44:34,967 --> 00:44:36,327
He has his way of solving it.

565
00:44:38,980 --> 00:44:39,665
Yeah.

566
00:44:47,240 --> 00:44:47,978
How was it?

567
00:44:47,992 --> 00:44:48,829
It was fun.

568
00:44:48,865 --> 00:44:49,745
I’m exhausted.

569
00:44:50,170 --> 00:44:54,123
Before we go home, let’s take selfies together.

570
00:44:54,145 --> 00:44:54,800
Sure.

571
00:45:05,790 --> 00:45:08,007
Can I stand in the middle?

572
00:45:08,167 --> 00:45:08,950
Sure.

573
00:45:17,149 --> 00:45:18,276
Let me see the pictures.

574
00:45:19,883 --> 00:45:21,192
I want to go take pictures there too.

575
00:45:21,214 --> 00:45:22,269
Sure.

576
00:45:22,580 --> 00:45:23,309
Hey.

577
00:45:27,992 --> 00:45:29,300
You now can take care of yourself.

578
00:45:32,180 --> 00:45:32,654
Huh?

579
00:45:35,250 --> 00:45:37,250
If you want to take care of Star too,

580
00:45:38,890 --> 00:45:40,000
I guess it won’t be too hard.

581
00:45:45,490 --> 00:45:46,545
You knew?

582
00:45:48,910 --> 00:45:51,243
If you’re going to keep your relationship a secret, then don’t make it obvious.

583
00:45:51,980 --> 00:45:55,490
I didn’t mean to hide it from you but…

584
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:56,472
Please take good care of Star.

585
00:46:06,150 --> 00:46:10,916
If you hurt her feelings, I’ll kill you.

586
00:46:29,470 --> 00:46:30,756
Thanks a lot for helping me build the model.

587
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:33,934
If I didn’t have your help, I don’t know when I would finish it.

588
00:46:34,190 --> 00:46:35,178
It’s not a big deal.

589
00:46:35,650 --> 00:46:37,818
I got to put myself into your castle.

590
00:46:38,530 --> 00:46:39,527
That’s good enough for me.

591
00:46:39,830 --> 00:46:40,341
Huh?

592
00:46:45,592 --> 00:46:47,590
For me, this model is a memory.

593
00:46:47,621 --> 00:46:50,043
I’ll remember the feelings and people who helped me build it.

594
00:46:50,065 --> 00:46:52,756
So you will think of me when you look at it, right?

595
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:57,229
The wizard model, doesn’t it resemble me?

596
00:46:58,910 --> 00:47:00,661
Oh, right.

597
00:47:01,090 --> 00:47:02,660
Why? What are you thinking?

598
00:47:03,370 --> 00:47:04,043
Nothing.

599
00:47:04,790 --> 00:47:05,287
Okay.

600
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:06,952
I got to go.

601
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:20,574
Hey.

602
00:47:21,860 --> 00:47:23,520
If you want to come to play again,

603
00:47:24,070 --> 00:47:25,614
Just tell the security that you come to see me.

604
00:47:27,690 --> 00:47:28,632
Tell him you come to see Jewel.

605
00:47:28,770 --> 00:47:29,250
Huh?

606
00:47:30,450 --> 00:47:31,600
What did you say your name is?

607
00:47:32,610 --> 00:47:34,043
Juwen?

608
00:47:35,700 --> 00:47:36,501
Jewel.

609
00:47:37,820 --> 00:47:39,040
Your name is unique.

610
00:47:39,700 --> 00:47:40,487
Jewel.

611
00:47:41,861 --> 00:47:43,860
Okay. I got to go, Jewel.

612
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:45,505
You should go back inside.

613
00:48:08,750 --> 00:48:12,487
Ivy, why don’t you let me walk you home?

614
00:48:15,301 --> 00:48:16,480
Why are you following me?

615
00:48:17,030 --> 00:48:20,523
You are acting strange.

616
00:48:20,730 --> 00:48:21,963
So I come to check on you.

617
00:48:22,630 --> 00:48:23,505
What’s wrong?

618
00:48:24,080 --> 00:48:24,727
Nothing.

619
00:48:26,370 --> 00:48:30,516
Did someone upset you so you need to take a walk to calm down?

620
00:48:37,550 --> 00:48:38,160
Right.

621
00:48:41,030 --> 00:48:43,643
It’s not bad to look at the star from afar like this.

622
00:48:51,860 --> 00:48:56,072
Aren’t they usually far away from us?

623
00:49:17,010 --> 00:49:17,490
Oh.

624
00:49:19,592 --> 00:49:20,378
Ivy.

625
00:49:21,403 --> 00:49:21,956
Are you…

626
00:49:21,985 --> 00:49:23,229
Don’t touch me.

627
00:50:06,510 --> 00:50:07,556
Why are you smiling?

628
00:50:07,592 --> 00:50:09,898
I’m not smiling.

629
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:12,250
You don’t need to give me a ride home.

630
00:50:12,392 --> 00:50:15,156
I want to because you did well today.

631
00:50:15,970 --> 00:50:16,494
Really?

632
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:20,196
What did I do well?

633
00:50:22,040 --> 00:50:26,174
You handled those men who tried to approach me.

634
00:50:30,770 --> 00:50:32,370
I didn’t do anything

635
00:50:35,490 --> 00:50:37,010
I thought you were talking about something else.

636
00:50:38,340 --> 00:50:38,880
Huh?

637
00:50:41,910 --> 00:50:42,625
Nothing.

638
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:45,869
What do you mean?

639
00:50:47,069 --> 00:50:47,847
I forgot.

640
00:50:49,010 --> 00:50:49,789
Lune.

641
00:50:51,780 --> 00:50:52,814
Do you want to see me get mad?

642
00:50:56,741 --> 00:50:57,549
I…

643
00:50:59,854 --> 00:51:00,625
This.

644
00:51:05,540 --> 00:51:06,247
I’m talking about this.

645
00:51:09,658 --> 00:51:11,260
You are getting bolder lately.

646
00:51:15,309 --> 00:51:16,261
Stop it.

647
00:51:16,283 --> 00:51:20,763
You are quite scary when you are mad.

648
00:51:23,380 --> 00:51:24,603
I don’t look scary.

649
00:51:26,430 --> 00:51:27,410
I look very cute.

650
00:51:33,090 --> 00:51:33,789
See?

651
00:51:34,770 --> 00:51:37,454
I’m not dangerous or scary and I won’t bite.

652
00:51:44,870 --> 00:51:46,640
Okay, I believe you.

653
00:51:48,350 --> 00:51:49,403
I believe you.

654
00:51:56,980 --> 00:51:57,920
Go.

655
00:51:58,167 --> 00:51:59,098
Go where?

656
00:51:59,141 --> 00:52:00,480
Go to bed.

657
00:52:01,150 --> 00:52:02,145
I’ll go.

658
00:52:03,020 --> 00:52:04,640
If you give me a goodnight kiss.

659
00:52:09,720 --> 00:52:11,352
Go. It’s bedtime.

660
00:52:11,389 --> 00:52:13,047
Okay, go home safely.

661
00:52:14,180 --> 00:52:15,192
Bye.

662
00:52:21,510 --> 00:52:23,323
Can I take a picture with you, Lune?

663
00:52:23,352 --> 00:52:24,727
Now, I start to feel jealous.

664
00:52:24,756 --> 00:52:27,512
You are the only one who sees this side of me.

665
00:52:27,541 --> 00:52:29,250
Why don’t you give Nana a chance?

666
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:31,454
If I date Nana, I don’t think we will hit it off.

667
00:52:31,476 --> 00:52:32,516
But If I date you.

668
00:52:33,650 --> 00:52:35,367
Why can’t you go have dinner with me?

669
00:52:35,396 --> 00:52:36,574
Everything is easy for you.

670
00:52:36,596 --> 00:52:37,934
Have you ever tried to do anything by yourself?

671
00:52:37,970 --> 00:52:39,396
It was better when we were strangers.

672
00:52:41,789 --> 00:52:43,780
Can we start over?
