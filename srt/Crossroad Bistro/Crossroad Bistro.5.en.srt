00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:10,960
Hello. Shanshan.

5
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,520
What took you so long to answer my call?

6
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:14,640
Are you at home?

7
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,079
I'm a housewife.

8
00:02:17,079 --> 00:02:19,520
Where else can I be if I'm not at home?

9
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,079
Alright, Mrs. Housewife.

10
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:23,240
Prepare to open the door. I'm downstairs.

11
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,280
Here. Take this.

12
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:35,920
What for?

13
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:40,040
My schoolmate came to visit me in Beijing.

14
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,840
We had lunch together nearby.

15
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,920
He bought this for my son.

16
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,640
Then why do you give this to me

17
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:47,160
if he bought it for your son?

18
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,960
My schoolmate

19
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,680
is very forgetful.

20
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,000
He always thinks my son is seven years old.

21
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,320
But my son is 12 now.

22
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:56,800
He is way too old to play with this.

23
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:59,360
Then I remembered your son can have fun with it.

24
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,440
So I brought this to you.

25
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:03,960
Kids can play with these kinds of toys at any age.

26
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,080
It's quite expensive.

27
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:07,200
Just take it back and give it to your son.

28
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:10,960
Come on, don't mention it.

29
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:13,560
Right now, apart from video games,

30
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,160
my son is not interested in anything at all.

31
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,640
Nowadays, kids are all like this.

32
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:17,960
Zhuang is like this too.

33
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,240
If I don't keep an eye on him

34
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,320
and set a time limit,

35
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:22,120
he can spend a whole day sitting in front of the screen

36
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,390
and doesn't even go to the toilet.

37
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,360
What were you doing just now

38
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,240
before I came here?

39
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:28,880
Were you writing?

40
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:30,640
No.

41
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:31,800
Don't even ask.

42
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:34,160
I was upset with my husband.

43
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,440
Did you quarrel with him?

44
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:40,440
I don't have the strength for that.

45
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,760
He hasn't had dinner at home for a week.

46
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,600
There were two times he said he would come back.

47
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,320
But he changed his mind both times.

48
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,920
The other day, my daughter asked me

49
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,760
if dad is having an affair.

50
00:03:51,079 --> 00:03:52,120
She startled me.

51
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,520
Where do kids get this kind of idea?

52
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,600
Normally, I keep her away

53
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,120
from the PEGI 18 dramas.

54
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,080
I told her it's not like that and that her dad is just busy.

55
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:02,240
I wasn't even sure of what I told her.

56
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,440
I texted him just now.

57
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,560
He said he will have dinner with clients again tonight.

58
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,720
The only thing I asked him was

59
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:09,680
if he made any new acquaintances recently.

60
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:11,600
He ended up getting pissed immediately

61
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,740
and said that I have nothing better to do but speculate.

62
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:15,490
He also said that I break the harmony of the family

63
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:17,200
and keep him from devoting himself to work.

64
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,200
So I said if I find a job

65
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,079
and keep myself busy, that will solve everything.

66
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:23,320
Then he asked who will take charge of the kids 
 if I'm working?

67
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:25,120
And he said he doesn't trust nannies.

68
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,320
I was really speechless.

69
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:30,760
Girl,

70
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,120
you talk like a machine gun.

71
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,400
Why did you say you are speechless?

72
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,400
Let me tell you.

73
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,600
If I were your husband,

74
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,760
I wouldn't want to come back, either.

75
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:38,240
You nag too much.

76
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,080
Which side are you on?

77
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:42,120
Do you think I like nagging?

78
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,640
These are nothing but trifles.

79
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:45,920
If you don't let me talk about this,

80
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,950
I will definitely get depressed for keeping it in.

81
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:50,680
I'm really sorry, Shanshan.

82
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,280
It's okay. Tell me what's the problem.

83
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:54,240
Your father-in-law accidentally tripped and fell.

84
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,440
He was just sent into hospital.

85
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,240
Is it serious?

86
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:58,120
Which hospital is he in?

87
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,240
It's Chao-Yang Hospital.

88
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,480
Stay calm. I will go there now.

89
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,720
Contact Shi Daming for me.

90
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,160
Alright. I will contact him on the way.

91
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,120
Don't worry.

92
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,520
Is everything alright?

93
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:08,790
Something came up and I have to leave.

94
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:12,000
Safe journey.

95
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,520
Hello,

96
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,480
the number you have dialed...

97
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,560
Where are you, Shi Daming?

98
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,800
Call me back immediately after turning on the phone.

99
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:32,120
Mom.

100
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,320
Are we having beef stew tonight?

101
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:36,080
Your beef stew is my favorite.

102
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,760
Don't you feel ashamed?

103
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,520
Don't you feel ashamed?

104
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,159
None of your business. You are a pain.

105
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,240
Mom, he is scolding me.

106
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,920
Your brother is a pain.

107
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,200
You are a pain.

108
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,520
You are a pain.

109
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:50,600
The meeting with the client tonight is canceled.

110
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:52,120
I'll have dinner at home.

111
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:56,600
Mom, dad is going home for dinner today.

112
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,040
So you heard it, huh?

113
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:03,360
Mom.

114
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,760
Shanshan. You're here.

115
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:07,840
How is he?

116
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:09,840
He has a bone fracture

117
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:10,880
and is in the operation room.

118
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,000
But he normally has no trouble moving about.

119
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,240
What happened today?

120
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,680
I didn't see the accident.

121
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,840
The neighbors saw it and called the ambulance.

122
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,040
They said he was walking down the garden stairs

123
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,320
when a kid swooshed by

124
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,640
on a skateboard.

125
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:25,160
He tried to avoid the kid but missed his footing.

126
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,480
Don't worry. He will be fine.

127
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:30,760
How is he?

128
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:31,600
The surgery went well.

129
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,640
He should be fine.

130
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:34,350
I was almost scared to death.

131
00:06:34,970 --> 00:06:36,400
As long as there're no complications.

132
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,840
But he has to stay in hospital for a few days 
 for observation.

133
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:40,159
You need to make the payment.

134
00:06:40,159 --> 00:06:40,720
OK.

135
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:41,440
I'll go.

136
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,320
Have a seat, mom.

137
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:48,480
Mom.

138
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:49,360
Shanshan.

139
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,560
Here, this is for you.

140
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,720
We'll need it when dad is discharged.

141
00:06:52,890 --> 00:06:54,760
How much did it cost? I'll transfer the money to you.

142
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,880
There's no need for that. Don't mention it, mom.

143
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,640
Shanshan.

144
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:00,600
Thank you for all your efforts.

145
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,720
Don't mention it, dad.

146
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:03,580
Relax and rest.

147
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:05,690
You need to rest for 100 days 
 to recover from a fracture.

148
00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:06,930
The TADs need to be removed next year.

149
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,720
I didn't expect that.

150
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:09,960
I'm getting old.

151
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:11,000
My senses have blunted.

152
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:13,920
I did it instinctively...

153
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,160
Alright, alright.

154
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,720
Just be happy you got lucky

155
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:18,800
and didn't land with your head.

156
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,280
That was pure luck.

157
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:21,600
Shanshan,

158
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,960
did you get in contact with Daming?

159
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,800
Yeah. He is on his way here.

160
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:25,720
He just got off the plane.

161
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:26,760
Tell him not to come.

162
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,200
He's been working really hard lately.

163
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:29,960
Mom,

164
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:32,800
You've been caring for your son all your life.

165
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,320
He is way over thirty now.

166
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:36,320
How can it be tiring for him to come to the hospital?

167
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,120
His dad has a fracture.

168
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,480
He is supposed to come and visit.

169
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,000
I don't need to be taken care of.

170
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,740
I will be discharged the day after tomorrow.

171
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:42,880
Alright, alright.

172
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:44,640
Eat the stuff.

173
00:07:46,159 --> 00:07:46,920
Shanshan,

174
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:48,760
listen to me.

175
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,280
It's different for Daming now.

176
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:51,480
Didn't he start a company

177
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:53,040
with his schoolmate?

178
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,320
It went on really well.

179
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:56,040
It's really different from the old days.

180
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,600
Get in touch with him more when you have time.

181
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,720
You are very capable. Spend more time teaching him.

182
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:04,200
After all, we are still a family.

183
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:04,880
Right?

184
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,680
Rest assured, mom.

185
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,960
I'm ready to help whenever he is in need.

186
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,000
Shanshan,

187
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,280
I've always treated you as my own daughter.

188
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,080
You and Daming

189
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:15,960
haven't been together for so many years

190
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,200
and you are both single.

191
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,240
Right?

192
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:21,200
Yingjie has grown up a lot.

193
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,160
If you and Daming go on like this,

194
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,600
it won't work.

195
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:26,200
So...

196
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,240
Can you just...

197
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:31,560
Ah right, mom.

198
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,720
Has Yingjie arrived home?

199
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:35,679
You reminded me.

200
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,440
He will be hungry when he comes back.

201
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:40,039
How about you go back home first, Shanshan?

202
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:42,000
Take him to a restaurant for dinner.

203
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,440
I will stay with him.

204
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,640
Let's wait a bit.

205
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,400
I think Shi Daming will arrive soon.

206
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,200
When he's here,

207
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,960
I will take you and Yingjie out for dinner.

208
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:49,800
Daming can stay with dad.

209
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:50,480
There's no need.

210
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,920
I don't need anyone. I can take care of myself.

211
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:54,850
I can't move the right half of my body, but I can still 
 move the left half.

212
00:08:54,850 --> 00:08:55,860
I'm not trying to be brave.

213
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,240
Dad.

214
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,720
How did you hurt yourself? Let me have a look.

215
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:01,680
It's a fracture.

216
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:02,800
Don't get startled so easily.

217
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:03,880
I haven't even touched you.

218
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,120
Why is it so serious?

219
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,080
It's not serious at all.

220
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:06,640
Really?

221
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:09,360
If it's not serious, why did they place several TADs 
 in you?

222
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,200
Dad,

223
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:11,120
you're not young anymore.

224
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,000
Why can't you just be careful?

225
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:13,480
Well...

226
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:15,360
It's not his fault.

227
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:16,840
Thank you.

228
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:18,800
It happens I took a flight back from Shanghai.

229
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,160
Isn't it a coincidence?

230
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,000
Yeah.

231
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:23,920
Coincidence.

232
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:24,520
Coincidence.

233
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:26,920
Now that you're back,

234
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,200
I have something to say.

235
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,020
Let's talk outside.

236
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:32,040
I'll go out now, dad and mom.

237
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:33,920
Sure, of course.

238
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:34,800
Alright. Have some rest.

239
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:42,360
Do you think they can get back together?

240
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:45,680
I want my soup.

241
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,240
What's the problem?

242
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,680
You should stay here overnight.

243
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,440
I have arranged a care worker.

244
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,120
She will start working once dad is discharged.

245
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:55,840
OK.

246
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,150
Thank you for taking care of it.

247
00:09:57,150 --> 00:09:58,760
Did you sort out Yingjie's transfer?

248
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:00,160
It's all done. I've made the payment too.

249
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,340
He can transfer at any time.

250
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,120
Good for you.

251
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,040
Did you tell mom about it?

252
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:07,400
I didn't.

253
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:08,680
Tell her yourself.

254
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,200
I'm just worried it will upset her.

255
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:15,680
You insisted to send Yingjie to an overseas school.

256
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,840
It's definitely your job to tell them the news.

257
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:20,760
The two of them brought the child up.

258
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:22,520
All of sudden, you send him away.

259
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:23,480
If mom gets upset,

260
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:25,640
you'll handle all the consequences alone.

261
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:29,440
Alright.

262
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:30,760
However,

263
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:33,000
as long as it's for Yingjie's benefit, she won't disagree.

264
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:35,840
I'll take her out now.

265
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:36,720
OK.

266
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,680
Don't drive too quickly.

267
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,000
Grandma,

268
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:41,840
do you want this?

269
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,000
I'm full.

270
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:47,200
I still can't get used to western food.

271
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,320
You two can have it.

272
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,680
Mom, do you want this?

273
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:52,080
I'm full. Have it.

274
00:10:58,560 --> 00:10:59,480
Mom,

275
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:01,720
you and dad educate Yingjie really well.

276
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,080
He has good manners.

277
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,280
We can't teach him much knowledge,

278
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:07,160
but we have to teach him basic manners.

279
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:10,000
Otherwise, people will think we fail to educate him.

280
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,320
I was too naive in the past

281
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,680
and always went against you.

282
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:17,520
At that time, I was trying

283
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,360
to keep Yingjie around me.

284
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:20,800
Now I understand

285
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,360
he should be with you.

286
00:11:23,570 --> 00:11:25,440
Let's forget about what happened in the past.

287
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,240
As long as Yingjie is well now,

288
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:30,880
nothing else matters.

289
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,440
Last time, you talked about this a lot.

290
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:42,880
Take it.

291
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:47,680
Why are you looking at me?

292
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,240
Your mom got this for you.

293
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,360
Take it.

294
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:53,560
Thanks, mom.

295
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:54,720
How do you thank me?

296
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,520
Any gesture of gratitude?

297
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:01,840
I was joking.

298
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,680
I need to go to the toilet, grandma.

299
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:06,760
Off you go.

300
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,760
I'm such a bad mother.

301
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:17,240
Even my own son is so distant.

302
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:18,280
He has grown up.

303
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:19,240
He's just shy.

304
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:21,600
Shanshan,

305
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:25,400
we have saved all the money

306
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,800
you gave Yingjie throughout the years.

307
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,640
It's even enough to support him in university.

308
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:31,360
If you have time in the future, come back more 
 and keep him company.

309
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:33,280
Don't just focus on earning money.

310
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,160
Alright, mom.

311
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:41,040
Mom, eat this.

312
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,640
Stop flattering me.

313
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,160
What's wrong?

314
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,440
Who else made a mistake?

315
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,680
It's nothing big.

316
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:48,480
Eat this.

317
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:49,320
Right, mom?

318
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:51,160
He failed the Chinese exam.

319
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,160
Shut your face.

320
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:54,280
I will beat you.

321
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:58,000
Mom, he is scolding me again.

322
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:00,680
How did you fail the Chinese exam?

323
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:02,080
I can understand failing Maths, but...

324
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:03,920
Don't say it like that.

325
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,040
He shouldn't fail any of the exams.

326
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,640
You're right. I was just saying...

327
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:11,720
It's already too much to fail Maths.

328
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:12,960
Why did you also fail Chinese?

329
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,600
It's just a primary school Chinese exam.

330
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:16,800
It's more difficult to fail it than to get a full mark.

331
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:17,360
Yeah.

332
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,480
Tell us, Zhuang.

333
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:20,720
The teacher said

334
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:23,320
although I failed the exam,

335
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,560
it's good that

336
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:26,680
I was being honest.

337
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,400
Do you think that was a compliment?

338
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:29,280
What?

339
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:30,520
Stop playing dumb.

340
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:32,720
Can anyone tell me what happened?

341
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:33,680
The title of the essay

342
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,120
was "A day with my father".

343
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,720
Your son wrote only one sentence.

344
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,560
"My dad hasn't been home for many days."

345
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:39,640
And he got a zero for the essay.

346
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:40,600
How can he not fail?

347
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:43,160
Aren't you bullshitting?

348
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:44,440
When did I not come back home?

349
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:47,960
I'm asleep when you come back.

350
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,600
You're not awake when I go to school.

351
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:52,520
How do I know if you're back or not?

352
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:59,960
Listen, this essay is actually very easy to write.

353
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:03,400
What is the purpose of it?

354
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:04,840
It aims at testing writing techniques.

355
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,290
It's about subjects, predicates, objects,

356
00:14:06,290 --> 00:14:07,880
attributes, adverbials and complements.

357
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,570
It's also about causes, processes and results.

358
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:11,800
Once you master the techniques,

359
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:13,400
you can make up anything.

360
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,160
Are you saying that it's okay to lie?

361
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,560
Did I say anything about lying?

362
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:22,280
Do you know what it means to lie?

363
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:23,320
Lying means

364
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:25,000
to benefit yourself

365
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:28,600
through making up stories

366
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:30,200
or not telling the truth.

367
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,040
The thing is...

368
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:33,960
To be more accurate,

369
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:36,240
what I was talking about is more like fiction.

370
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:37,920
Sure, fiction.

371
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,160
You should be named after that.

372
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:40,640
Remember it, Zhuang.

373
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:42,520
Later on, write everything your dad taught you.

374
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,840
Come on. Don't make trouble.

375
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,240
Make trouble?

376
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,080
You are a neglecting father.

377
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:49,570
How dare you accuse me of making trouble!

378
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:52,080
You are a Literature graduate.

379
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,000
You should teach him some serious stuff.

380
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,220
If I have to teach him, what's the purpose of schooling?

381
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,000
Come on.

382
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:59,520
Let's not have internal conflicts.

383
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:00,960
How about this? You have a day off.

384
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,800
I will help him with the homework after dinner.

385
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:03,360
OK?

386
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:06,160
Dad, can I play a game

387
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:08,520
after finishing my homework?

388
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:09,640
No.

389
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:14,600
I agree.

390
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:20,040
BANMA AI is the choice for you.

391
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:22,480
Mom, look. That's the course.

392
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,120
My classmates said their course

393
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:26,600
is very interesting.

394
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,280
Like, really interesting.

395
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:30,360
Alright, I will download the app for you.

396
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:31,320
OK.

397
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:38,960
Do you want to piss me off?

398
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:40,880
Even if it's a stone,

399
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:42,080
it can get the answer right

400
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,600
after I explain and analyze the question 
 so explicitly.

401
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:44,240
Come over here.

402
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,320
Stand up and do the homework.

403
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:47,200
What's wrong? Can't you think when you sit down?

404
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:50,680
Mom, dad seems to be angry.

405
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:51,600
Really?

406
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:55,480
Why do you always want to drink water and pee?

407
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:56,560
Let me tell you.

408
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,480
If you can't get the answer right, don't you want to pee.

409
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:01,560
Here. I've downloaded it.

410
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:02,600
OK.

411
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:07,360
I have explained it so well to you.

412
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:09,400
Look at this.

413
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:10,280
How many cars are there?

414
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:11,360
How many wheels can you see?

415
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:13,800
Five.

416
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:16,000
How many wheels do five cars have?

417
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,120
Is it so difficult?

418
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:19,200
Go to the toilet, Zhuang.

419
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:24,120
I am educating him.

420
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,080
Why do you interrupt me?

421
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:27,160
Do you think he can solve the problem by holding pee?

422
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:33,400
Now I understand what it means to befriend the distant 
 while attacking the nearby.

423
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,760
When I'm helping him with the homework,

424
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:36,480
I can manage to talk to him from a distance.

425
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,570
But it's difficult to not beat him when I'm too close.

426
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:42,080
You've only fulfilled your duty as a dad for half an hour

427
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:42,920
and you can't take it.

428
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:45,960
I'll leave it to you.

429
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:47,400
I'll go and watch the cartoon with Yuan.

430
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:48,320
Really?

431
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:50,720
Do you know which is the main character of this cartoon?

432
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,840
Can you tell the good from the bad?

433
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:54,120
Why are the good guys nice

434
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:55,280
and why are the bad guys evil?

435
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,560
What bad stuff did the good guys do

436
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:58,020
and what good stuff did the bad guys do?

437
00:16:58,020 --> 00:16:58,960
Do you have any idea?

438
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,440
Your daughter will ask these questions at any moment.

439
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,160
Can you answer these questions?

440
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:06,440
Don't be surprised.

441
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:08,480
I've been living like this every day.

442
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:12,000
A husband like you is referred to

443
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,079
as a cloud partner on the Internet.

444
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:16,480
It means a remote virtual partner who can only 
 be approached

445
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:17,560
through interactive mode.

446
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:19,520
Normally, he is saved to the cloud.

447
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:21,920
The biggest problem is that he can't synchronize.

448
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:24,160
You can't even meet him, not to mention counting on him.

449
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:25,960
Look at you.

450
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:29,040
You're not satisfied unless you make fun of me every day.

451
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:32,880
I'm in charge of dozens of people in a firm.

452
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:34,600
You're in charge of two kids in a family.

453
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,960
Who do you think has more work to do?

454
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,840
If an employee doesn't behave, you can fire him or her.

455
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:41,360
If the kids don't behave, can I fire them?

456
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:43,240
Yeah.

457
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:44,890
I know that it's tiring for you.

458
00:17:44,890 --> 00:17:45,680
Think about this.

459
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:47,000
When I don't have to meet the clients,

460
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,310
don't I get off work on time and come back

461
00:17:48,310 --> 00:17:49,280
to help you every day?

462
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:50,680
Help me?

463
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:54,350
You are a married man.

464
00:17:54,350 --> 00:17:55,760
Do you think to get off work on time

465
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:58,000
and come back home is the greatest favor you can 
 grant me?

466
00:17:58,520 --> 00:17:59,360
You're such a comedian.

467
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,840
[In the library.]

468
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:37,570
[Come back for hotpot.]

469
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:48,520
[Nah, I'm tired. I'll go back to the dorm.]

470
00:18:49,430 --> 00:18:52,490
[Then I'll invite someone else over.]

471
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:55,630
[Be my guest.]

472
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,600
The smell is so nice.

473
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,600
Didn't you say you don't feel like coming here?

474
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:28,120
Wash your hands.

475
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:38,600
Is there any beer left?

476
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:41,160
I have some imported Wurenbacher Belgian white beer.

477
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:41,840
Is it okay?

478
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:43,000
Sure.

479
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:01,560
Why did you prepare so many dishes?

480
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:02,880
What if I didn't come?

481
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:06,560
If I still don't know what you're thinking,

482
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:08,640
we've wasted ten years having a relationship.

483
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:13,600
Are you saying that

484
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,360
you have me in the palm of your hand?

485
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:17,720
I can't even if I want to.

486
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:20,240
You have such a strong personality

487
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,560
and you won't take "no".

488
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,440
Whenever you make a decision,

489
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:26,280
I have to do it the way you like.

490
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,680
I can't even say no.

491
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,120
Really?

492
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:32,160
Yeah.

493
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,480
Let me do the math.

494
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:38,840
Whether it's about if I should apply for a Ph.D. degree

495
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:40,800
or start working after post-graduate studies,

496
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,400
or about if I should do the Ph.D. in Beijing,

497
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,600
or about if we shouldn't live together at all,

498
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:47,200
which of these matters didn't turn out the way you want?

499
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:50,640
If you put it like that...

500
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,720
And then you say that I have a strong personality.

501
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:55,880
I'm almost among the vulnerable populations.

502
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:56,680
Alright.

503
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,160
Here's to you, Mr. Vulnerable.

504
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:01,320
You are mistreated.

505
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:03,200
To me?

506
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:05,000
You're too friendly today.

507
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,280
Do you have something to say?

508
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,120
You didn't waste your IQ at all.

509
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:10,400
Drink it first.

510
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:17,520
The beer is not bad.

511
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,040
I can taste the aroma of fruits.

512
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:20,720
Here's the thing.

513
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:23,040
You Shanshan wants to open a restaurant.

514
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:24,240
She has picked the location.

515
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,240
She wants me to join her.

516
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:29,720
Why is it always You Shanshan?

517
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,600
How many times have I told you?

518
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:32,960
Don't hang out with her.

519
00:21:33,570 --> 00:21:35,480
The two of us and her are not in the same world.

520
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:39,200
I just want to do something for real.

521
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:40,920
Otherwise, what can I do?

522
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:42,800
WeChat business or procurement service?

523
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:44,680
Those aren't proper occupations.

524
00:21:45,690 --> 00:21:47,920
Do you want me to stay at home all day and take care of you?

525
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:50,320
If so, you will be tired of me sooner or later.

526
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:53,480
Let me ask you this.

527
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:56,400
What can you do if you open a restaurant?

528
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:57,720
A chef?

529
00:21:58,280 --> 00:21:59,160
A cashier?

530
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:01,680
I'm one of the shareholders.

531
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:03,080
I invested 300,000 RMB.

532
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:04,920
What?

533
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:06,720
300,000 RMB?

534
00:22:08,330 --> 00:22:09,800
Where did you get all that money?

535
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:11,920
You Shanshan helped me earn it in the stock market.

536
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:13,640
I only had a principle of 100,000 RMB.

537
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,240
It tripled in less than three years.

538
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:16,520
Do you think she will trick me?

539
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,120
I still can't agree.

540
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,760
How much does she earn and how much do you earn?

541
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:22,240
What if the restaurant is out of business?

542
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,800
That amount of money means nothing to her.

543
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:24,400
What about you?

544
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:27,000
It's not even open and you're already jinxing it.

545
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
What's the matter with you?

546
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,960
You have to prepare for the worst of everything.

547
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:31,520
Tell me then, what should I do?

548
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:34,680
Come on.

549
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,880
Why do you have to do something?

550
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:41,080
You're a girl. You don't need a job.

551
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:43,320
Why do I feel you're getting

552
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:45,280
so discontent?

553
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:47,560
Why can't girls have career developments?

554
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:50,760
I didn't mean that girls shouldn't have a career.

555
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:52,920
What I meant was

556
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:54,320
you don't need it.

557
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:57,200
On what grounds?

558
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:58,400
Don't you have me?

559
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:02,040
What if you abandon me?

560
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:04,080
I won't have anything when the time comes.

561
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:05,720
How is it possible?

562
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:07,240
Impossible.

563
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:09,040
It's mere words.

564
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:11,520
Come on.

565
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:13,520
I knew it.

566
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:15,840
You're talking about the marriage certificate again.

567
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:18,960
It's not that I won't marry you.

568
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:23,320
We already made an agreement.

569
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:25,880
Wait until I get the degree,

570
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:27,160
find a job and buy a house,

571
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:28,400
we will get married immediately.

572
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:30,440
I have told my mother about it.

573
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:32,600
She also agrees.

574
00:23:33,150 --> 00:23:33,800
Do you get it?

575
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:37,400
So forget about your investment.

576
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:38,960
Save that 300,000 RMB.

577
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:40,600
Perhaps

578
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:41,560
we can even

579
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:43,240
buy the house earlier

580
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:44,660
and marry ahead of schedule.

581
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:50,040
Li Xiang.

582
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,920
I never asked you to buy a house.

583
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:55,680
You insisted that we won't marry until you buy a house.

584
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:57,680
It's your business and you can take care of it.

585
00:23:58,050 --> 00:23:59,360
I will take care of my own money.

586
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,760
Come on.

587
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,360
You don't love me if you say that.

588
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:08,800
I gave you ten years of my youth.

589
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:10,240
Do you really think that I don't love you?

590
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:29,440
We always argue a bit every time I come back.

591
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:31,800
It's so disappointing.

592
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:36,080
I'm not asking for your approval.

593
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:37,480
I'm just informing you.

594
00:24:58,680 --> 00:24:59,520
I'm here.

595
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:00,720
Are you at home?

596
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:01,680
Yeah.

597
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:04,200
After entering the courtyard, keep walking 
 until you reach the end.

598
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:06,040
The wing on the right side is my place.

599
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:07,040
Alright.

600
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:01,040
Open the door, sister.

601
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:04,360
It's late in the evening. Who is it?

602
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:12,840
There's a ghost.

603
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:19,560
What's the matter?

604
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:20,680
Who is it?

605
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:31,560
What was that?

606
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:33,000
It scared me to death.

607
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:41,320
That's my sister.

608
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,000
Do you remember that I told you

609
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,120
I have an elder sister

610
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:45,720
who kicks anyone who scares her.

611
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:47,640
You have such a bad memory.

612
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:49,680
Why are you still laughing?

613
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:51,880
I was almost scared to death by him.

614
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:53,600
What kind of people are you bringing home?

615
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:55,880
She scared me to death too.

616
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:57,600
I thought I was in the wrong place.

617
00:26:58,120 --> 00:26:59,520
If the neighbors called the police,

618
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:01,680
there would be nothing I can do to clear my name.

619
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:02,680
You deserve it.

620
00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:05,560
Would it happen if you didn't think about the revenge?

621
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:07,000
Also,

622
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:08,920
it's okay if you were in the wrong place.

623
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:10,960
When she opened the door,

624
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:13,720
I saw a great beauty instead of you.

625
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:15,560
If I didn't wear the mask,

626
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:17,520
I probably could have chatted with her for a bit.

627
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:19,360
Sure.

628
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:21,520
Come over and chat with her.

629
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:23,120
I'd rather not.

630
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:26,200
What if your neighbors beat me?

631
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:29,720
You've got a good sister.

632
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:31,640
She certainly knows where the Achilles' heel is.

633
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:33,720
Of course.

634
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:35,200
You scared her first. You deserve it.

635
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:36,840
I left the stuff at your door.

636
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:37,640
Remember to get them.

637
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:39,760
Oh no.

638
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:40,920
My bag.

639
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:42,280
I left the bag at your door.

640
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:47,200
He finally remembered the bag.

641
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:48,920
So what?

642
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:50,520
Do you want to turn around and fetch it?

643
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:51,440
No, thank you.

644
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:52,980
I don't want to see your sister again.

645
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:53,720
How about this?

646
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:55,480
I'm going to the Art Studio tomorrow.

647
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:56,640
It's close to your place.

648
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,200
I'll come to you tomorrow and get it.

649
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:00,000
How about I take it to you tomorrow?

650
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,240
Alright? We'll be close anyways.

651
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:01,880
What do you think?

652
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:05,120
Ask him

653
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:07,360
is he alright after I kicked him like that?

654
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:12,280
My sister told me to ask you

655
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,200
did she destroy your

656
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:16,800
reproduction functions with that kick?

657
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:17,720
It's possible.

658
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:19,080
Let me tell you.

659
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:20,720
If I can't have kids anymore,

660
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,320
I will blackmail your sister.

661
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:23,800
Sure.

662
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:24,400
Welcome.

663
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:25,840
If you become my brother-in-law,

664
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:27,160
I totally approve of it.

665
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:54,920
Good.

666
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:58,440
That's all for today's rehearsal.

667
00:28:58,680 --> 00:28:59,800
See you tomorrow.

668
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:01,560
See you.

669
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:03,000
Goodbye.

670
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:05,280
Bye-bye.

671
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:22,880
The peach and the plum do not speak,

672
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:25,720
yet a path is born beneath them.

673
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:28,000
Hello.

674
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:28,560
Hello.

675
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,280
It's our second handshake.

676
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:33,400
It's actually not the second time.

677
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:35,320
I have met you many times.

678
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:36,200
Really?

679
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:38,560
It's just you didn't notice me.

680
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:42,360
You sing so well.

681
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:45,680
Your calligraphy is so beautiful.

682
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:47,760
Thanks for the compliment.

683
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:49,160
Let me take a photo.

684
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:50,840
I didn't manage to take a photo last time.

685
00:29:50,890 --> 00:29:51,960
The characters evaporated.

686
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:53,440
Alright.

687
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:14,680
Can I help you?

688
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:15,040
Hello.

689
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:16,520
Can I ask if Liu Liangzhou is here?

690
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:23,280
As for the sky,

691
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:25,240
lower the brightness for a bit

692
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:27,440
from here to there

693
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:28,780
and apply a gradient.

694
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:33,160
And the grass from here to there,

695
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:35,800
less green.

696
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:38,120
Lower the saturation level.

697
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:39,160
Right.

698
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:40,840
Lower.

699
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:44,160
OK.

700
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:45,000
The next one.

701
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:50,080
And the shadow.

702
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:52,280
Yeah. More shadow.

703
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:53,080
A bit more.

704
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:55,000
Over here.

705
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:00,160
Make the highlight in this whole area brighter.

706
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:02,080
Yeah.

707
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:02,720
OK.

708
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:03,680
The next one.

709
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:05,920
Lower the saturation level.

710
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:07,400
OK.

711
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:09,200
That will do.

712
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,000
Let's go.

713
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:13,440
Come on.

714
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:16,760
A bit more green.

715
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:20,120
Yes.

716
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:22,680
OK.

717
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:25,480
The next one.

718
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:36,600
Why did you leave?

719
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:38,760
Because you were so absorbed,

720
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:40,600
we didn't want to disturb you.

721
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:42,560
I wanted to buy you dinner.

722
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:44,200
Let's skip today.

723
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:45,080
How about tomorrow?

724
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:46,560
Shall we make the plan tomorrow?

725
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:48,360
OK. Tomorrow it is.

726
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:49,080
OK.

727
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:49,800
Deal.

728
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:50,640
Bye-bye.

729
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:57,720
Sister,

730
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:00,200
has it been

731
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:01,480
a long time since you saw

732
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:03,600
the back of a sturdy guy?

733
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:05,520
What do you mean?

734
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:09,160
I saw the way you looked at Liu Liangzhou just now.

735
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:10,640
You couldn't take your eyes off him,

736
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:13,840
Why are you bullshitting?

737
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:15,800
I was half asleep.

738
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:17,640
I look at all things the same way.

739
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,520
What should we have for dinner?

740
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:22,760
Chai Yong is receiving guests tonight.

741
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:24,080
I have to attend that.

742
00:32:24,910 --> 00:32:26,840
Is it another business of hundreds of millions?

743
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:29,680
Where can he get such a business?

744
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:32,120
It's not about business today.

745
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:34,200
Some of his friends from other places are visiting.

746
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:35,360
It's just a dinner.

747
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:37,000
Then why did he ask you to go?

748
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:39,800
Tell me, why can't he do anything without you now?

749
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:41,840
He is dependent on you. Textbook dependent.

750
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:42,920
Shut up.

751
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:44,880
Why does everything sound weird

752
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,080
when you say it?

753
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:48,160
Why don't you come with me?

754
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:50,760
I'm not attending an old people's meeting.

755
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:53,480
I wanted to bring you with me.

756
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:56,160
Feng Xi asked us to go Karaoke tonight.

757
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:57,600
Who is Feng Xi?

758
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,120
She was the happy dumb girl next to me

759
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:01,080
when I brought you to dinner last time.

760
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:01,920
Do you remember?

761
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:03,120
I see.

762
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:04,520
Have fun.

763
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:09,440
Well, I plan to go back home

764
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:11,440
and read the script first.

765
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:12,800
Where should I drop you off?

766
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:15,240
Why are you so cunning?

767
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:16,800
Can't you just drive me there?

768
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:18,520
It's out of my way.

769
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:21,680
When you want it, everywhere can be in your way.

770
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:23,800
But the thing is, I don't want to do that.

771
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:27,120
I'm falling in love with the sky, the earth

772
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:28,800
and my destined love.

773
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:32,280
I'm thinking about you, waiting for you

774
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:33,680
and I can't focus my mind.

775
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:35,120
What happens now?

776
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:36,520
Did Li Xiang agree?

777
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:37,840
His opinion doesn't matter.

778
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:39,360
Anyways, I agree and that's it.

779
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:42,400
I can't even bother to comment on the two of you.

780
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:49,640
My destined love.

781
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:58,120
Give me a round of applause.

782
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:00,880
I love listening to you singing so much.

783
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:01,880
It's pure happiness.

784
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:02,960
How about I sing another song?

785
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:04,440
You can even sing for the whole night.

786
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:05,920
No problem.

787
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:08,000
I'm called Mrs. Chinese playlist.

788
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:09,440
Tonight, I will prove to you

789
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:11,239
that I'm worthy of the nickname.

790
00:34:11,239 --> 00:34:12,280
Really?

791
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:12,929
Of course.

792
00:34:12,929 --> 00:34:14,480
I'll request the song and you'll sing it.

793
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:15,719
Request whichever song you like.

794
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:16,760
Come on.

795
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:19,480
Feng Xi just told me

796
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:20,360
she likes you.

797
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:22,320
I also like your personality.

798
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:23,880
You're outgoing and cute.

799
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:25,320
Alright, enough of the compliments.

800
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:26,760
I know it.

801
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:28,880
I have something serious to tell you.

802
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:31,199
I plan to open a restaurant.

803
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:32,449
Feng Xi is also a shareholder.

804
00:34:34,230 --> 00:34:34,920
How about that?

805
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:36,480
Are you interested?

806
00:34:38,739 --> 00:34:40,280
Do you want to open a restaurant with me?

807
00:34:42,679 --> 00:34:43,880
Forget about it.

808
00:34:45,239 --> 00:34:46,760
If you don't like a company,

809
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:47,560
tell me which one it is.

810
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:49,679
I can try to put it out of business.

811
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:51,960
You don't have to run it. We have Feng Xi.

812
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:53,400
You just need to make an investment.

813
00:34:54,210 --> 00:34:56,120
I can't promise you how much money you can earn,

814
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:58,280
but at least it's a long-term meal ticket.

815
00:34:58,280 --> 00:34:58,720
Wait.

816
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:00,960
Really, Shan?

817
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:02,920
Why do you choose me?

818
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:04,680
There're so many rich business people around you.

819
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:05,830
No matter which one you pick,

820
00:35:05,830 --> 00:35:07,000
all of them can cooperate with you.

821
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,960
If they join in, it won't feel the same.

822
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:11,800
I planned to do it myself

823
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:13,560
and let Feng Xi run it.

824
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:14,840
But after I told her about it,

825
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:16,310
she wanted to be a shareholder.

826
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,400
I thought it's actually good.

827
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,000
If she invests in it, it's her business too.

828
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,120
It's definitely different from working for others.

829
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:23,720
In for a penny, in for a pound.

830
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:25,360
So I decided to recruit people I like.

831
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:26,720
That's why I came to you.

832
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:27,520
Yeah.

833
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:28,640
Let's do something together.

834
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:29,640
It's so much fun.

835
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:35,280
I think I'll pass.

836
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:37,720
I'm used to following my own inclinations.

837
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:40,040
I fear I would be a liability

838
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:41,200
after I join you.

839
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:42,640
Also,

840
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,800
I don't have so much spare money for investment.

841
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,380
Money is the least important thing.

842
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:47,480
Let's consider it later on.

843
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:49,180
If you don't have enough, I can even lend you some.

844
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:49,880
Just tell me.

845
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:51,680
Honestly, are you interested in this?

846
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:54,520
Bao Xue, you're doomed.

847
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:56,680
Once You Shanshan wants something,

848
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:58,160
she won't give up.

849
00:35:58,160 --> 00:35:59,240
You can't escape.

850
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:03,960
Shan, you're so nice to me.

851
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:06,400
You're even willing to lend me money.

852
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,560
How about this?

853
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:11,240
Allow me to think about it.

854
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:13,200
I'll go back home and seriously consider this.

855
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:14,200
OK?

856
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:17,440
OK.

857
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:19,580
Then let's focus on singing tonight.

858
00:36:19,580 --> 00:36:20,880
Think about it when you go home.

859
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:22,000
I'll ask you out tomorrow.

860
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:22,400
Really?

861
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,440
Tomorrow?

862
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:25,200
Do you want to keep me waiting for half a year?

863
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:29,240
Aren't you Mrs.Chinese playlist?

864
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:30,560
Go on. Don't stop.

865
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:32,200
What do you want to sing? I'll request it for you.

866
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:33,080
Whichever.

867
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:35,960
Request "Yes, I will" for her.

868
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:36,480
Sure.

869
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:38,800
Wait a moment.

870
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:42,040
I haven't agreed to it.

871
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:45,560
Come on. "Yes, I will".

872
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:47,080
I'll say it first.

873
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:48,280
It's just a song.

874
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:49,360
Don't get me wrong.

875
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:51,480
Just sing.

876
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:52,440
Come on.

877
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:53,800
Come on.

878
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:02,440
Morning, Zhao.

879
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,040
Look at the time, it's almost noon.

880
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:12,200
Morning.

881
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:13,680
Morning.

882
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:15,400
Why is it only you?

883
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:16,560
Where's your sister?

884
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:18,080
She just woke up.

885
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:20,160
What will we eat?

886
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:22,120
I won't join you later on.

887
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:24,280
Something cropped up and I need to take care of it.

888
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:26,520
Why don't you get it?

889
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:29,600
I'm giving you a chance

890
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:31,400
to buy the great beauty lunch in private.

891
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:34,320
But the thing is, I don't know your sister well.

892
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:35,160
It will be so awkward.

893
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:36,640
Why are you such a chicken?

894
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:39,000
Listen, my sister is way

895
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:40,720
out of any normal guy's league.

896
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:41,920
Did you tell her about it?

897
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:44,080
Don't worry, I've told her everything.

898
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:45,520
She also wants to apologize for

899
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:46,640
kicking you right on target.

900
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:48,000
Wait for her over here.

901
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:53,120
If you say it like this, I'll get nervous later on.

902
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:56,600
How can you be so timid?

903
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:57,920
Don't make me despise you.

904
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,080
Fine.

905
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:03,200
I shall

906
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:05,120
do as you command.

907
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:45,200
Let's go.
