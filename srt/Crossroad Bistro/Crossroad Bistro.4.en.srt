4
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:31,240
Jade,

5
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:33,160
you're doing my make-up.

6
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:35,240
Usually, only the leading role
 can have this privilege.

7
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:38,760
I feel so honored.

8
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:39,920
Enough.

9
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,000
Don't be glib with me.

10
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,040
Even the director appreciate

11
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,320
that you came and saved the day.

12
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,160
Of course, I must treat you well.

13
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:47,560
Look up.

14
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,640
The director said that
 he'll finish your part in three days

15
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,040
so as not to take too much of your time.

16
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,360
Could you just be honest with me, Jade?

17
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,720
Who cares about my time?

18
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,360
It must be that the leading actor is too busy.

19
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,320
Fine.

20
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,320
You're the smartest, alright?

21
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,120
Jade,

22
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,480
it must be you who recommended me

23
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,320
to the director as the understudy.

24
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:11,320
It's not me.

25
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,040
It's the cameraman.

26
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,240
He showed the director

27
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,840
the video of you riding.

28
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,120
Then the director agreed immediately.

29
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,280
The video of me riding?

30
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:22,000
Yes.

31
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,680
Who is the cameraman?

32
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,640
Liu Liangzhou.

33
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,120
Liu Liangzhou?

34
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:27,760
Correct.

35
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,680
My goodness.

36
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,560
Why do I keep running into him?

37
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:33,840
It must be fate.

38
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,200
You should thank him sometime.

39
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,200
He seems like a nice guy.

40
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:39,440
He's quite professional

41
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,960
and he's got some ideas.

42
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,000
Then, I must thank him.

43
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:44,120
That's it.

44
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:46,040
I'll touch up your lips on the set.

45
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,680
Great.

46
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,600
Jade, you're definitely the best make-up artist.

47
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,040
I look so good.

48
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:53,600
What's this?

49
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:58,840
Jade, is this mask yours?

50
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,920
It's for another film.

51
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:02,320
I came straight over

52
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:03,560
as soon as I was done with that one.

53
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:04,800
I haven't got a chance to go home.

54
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:07,280
This is so cool.

55
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,280
Can I borrow it for a while?

56
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,440
The camera on the track.

57
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,519
Keep the composition.

58
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:23,120
Keep it slow.

59
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:24,520
Why the hurry?

60
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:26,720
Slower.

61
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,120
OK.

62
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,760
Keep it.

63
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:30,480
Hold it.

64
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,880
More.

65
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:37,200
OK.

66
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,760
Turn on one light of Camera B.

67
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,320
OK.

68
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,320
Director, the cameras are ready.

69
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,800
Good. Actors.

70
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:48,640
Mr. Huang,

71
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:49,880
the set is ready.

72
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,280
We can start as soon as you're ready.

73
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,000
Costume!

74
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:52,600
Come here.

75
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,760
We are really grateful

76
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,520
that you can come.

77
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,360
The film will definitely succeed
if we have you.

78
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:58,920
I mean it.

79
00:04:59,120 --> 00:04:59,880
Look.

80
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:00,320
Hmm...

81
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:02,040
Which one do you like?

82
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,320
That's it.

83
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:14,680
Mr. Huang, we can start as soon as you get changed.

84
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,720
Whether I play a role or not depends on three things.

85
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,360
First of all,

86
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,400
the script must be good.

87
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,120
Of course.

88
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,000
The characters are interesting.

89
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:22,360
Sure.

90
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,200
The lines are sophisticated.

91
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,080
Sure.

92
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,880
So let me ask you.

93
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,960
Which one can you offer me?

94
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,320
Give me one reason.

95
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,720
Do you think I'll play in your film

96
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,560
just for the pitiful remuneration?

97
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,560
I don't need any explanation.

98
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,720
Enough.

99
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,080
I need to see a good script,

100
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:45,680
alright?

101
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,120
Talk to my agent directly.

102
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:49,680
I'm in the middle of shooting right now.

103
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:50,360
OK.

104
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:53,520
Bo.

105
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:55,840
Director.

106
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:58,320
Haven't seen you for a while.

107
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:58,760
Thank you.

108
00:05:58,760 --> 00:05:59,960
Thanks a lot. Take a seat.

109
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,920
It's great that you can come.

110
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:03,680
You look good,

111
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:04,640
Director.

112
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:05,600
Just now,

113
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,080
I noticed that you were so angry.

114
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:08,800
I thought you meant my film.

115
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,480
I wouldn't dare!

116
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,480
Then I knew you were on your phone.

117
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,200
Of course.

118
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:13,800
Right.

119
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,800
I sent you a script

120
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,120
a while ago.

121
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,800
It's my next film.

122
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,320
Have you got a chance to take a look?

123
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,840
Another one?

124
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:25,200
It's the one I gave you the other day.

125
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:29,320
Is it a story

126
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:31,280
between one person and another?

127
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:32,280
Yes, that's the one.

128
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:36,400
I bet you have too many scripts to read.

129
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,800
Now that you're here,

130
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,240
let me tell you

131
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,920
what the story is about.

132
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,760
I'll give you a brief idea.

133
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:44,200
Director.

134
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,240
The story is about...

135
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:47,240
Director, excuse me.

136
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,800
But we don't have enough time.

137
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,800
Bo has a flight to catch at 4:00 PM.

138
00:06:51,159 --> 00:06:53,080
We need to start shooting now.

139
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,320
I'm terribly sorry.

140
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,600
You have another one at Hengdian?

141
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,920
Yes, the shooting is in the evening.

142
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,000
I just come and go between the two places.

143
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,240
Alright. Let's start right away.

144
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,640
I came today because you're the director.

145
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:03,320
Sure, I understand.

146
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:04,480
Let's start.

147
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,160
Thanks.

148
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,440
Costume! Get to work.

149
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:10,520
Thank you. I really appreciate it.

150
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:12,880
Which scene?

151
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:14,760
Episode 95, Scene 36.

152
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,080
Tell me the content and the mood.

153
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:20,120
Mr. Huang, it's about the two of us
seeing each other again after a long time

154
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,480
and we feel sad

155
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,720
talking about the past.

156
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,120
Nice to meet you.

157
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:24,880
Nice to meet you.

158
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,320
OK, I know.

159
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:34,320
I'm ready.

160
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:37,159
Sir, do we need a rehearsal first?

161
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,120
No need. I have no time.

162
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:39,840
Be quick.

163
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,000
What are we waiting for?

164
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,320
Hurry up!

165
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:52,880
Everyone, get ready!

166
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:53,600
Are we shooting or not?

167
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,120
Costume!

168
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:54,640
Quickly.

169
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:55,240
Get ready for action.

170
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:57,040
From the moment I enter the scene, right?

171
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,120
That's right.

172
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,400
OK. Everyone be quiet.

173
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,320
Get ready for action.

174
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,120
Ready?

175
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,320
Wait. I need to summon up my emotions.

176
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,200
Sorry.

177
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,240
Let me know when you're ready.

178
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,400
Alright, Mr. Huang?

179
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:30,800
Attention.

180
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:31,320
Audio!

181
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:32,320
Audio is ready.

182
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:33,520
Camera.

183
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:35,960
Action.

184
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:05,320
I haven't seen you for so many years.

185
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,560
You haven't changed a bit.

186
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:18,560
One. Two.

187
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,640
One. Two. Three. Four. Five.

188
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,600
Have you ever thought of coming to see me?

189
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:40,480
You gave me your promise and you left.

190
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,600
For that promise, I've waited three years.

191
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:52,000
Look at him.

192
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,160
He's such a veteran.

193
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:57,320
Now that he sits in the center of the scene,

194
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:00,680
the camera will give him all frontal shots

195
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:03,040
while that girl will only show her back in the picture.

196
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,640
One. Two. Three. Four. Five. Six. Seven.

197
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:22,680
Seven. Six. Five. Four. Three. Two. One.

198
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:23,760
Three. Two. One. Three. Two. One.

199
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:24,800
Four. Five. Six. Seven. Three. Two. One.

200
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:25,960
Enough. Say no more.

201
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,640
I've been waiting for you for the last three years.

202
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:33,480
Every night, I waited for you to contact me.

203
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,800
But you never did.

204
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,840
You haven't sent a single message.

205
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,840
I came here today to say goodbye.

206
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:43,960
We're over.

207
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:03,560
One. Two. Three.

208
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,160
One. Two. Three.

209
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:09,880
One. Two. Three.

210
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,680
One. Two. Three. Four. Five. Six.

211
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:20,160
Seven. Eight. Nine. Ten.

212
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:27,120
Jack. Queen. King. Ace.

213
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:32,600
Stop.

214
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,840
Just let me go.

215
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:35,640
To be honest,

216
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:37,080
I've thought everything through

217
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,520
before I came here.

218
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:40,080
As soon as I step out of this cafÃ©,

219
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:42,320
we are strangers.

220
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,440
I mean it.

221
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:46,280
Don't come to see me anymore.

222
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:46,800
I mean it.

223
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:49,440
I...

224
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,520
One.

225
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:53,920
Two. Three.

226
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:58,880
Do-u-zo yo-ro-shi-ku

227
00:11:58,880 --> 00:11:59,520
go-za-i-mas.

228
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:00,240
Sa-yo-na-ra.

229
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:07,000
We haven't cut yet.

230
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,440
I'm sorry.

231
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:09,400
Sorry.

232
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,640
Director, I think that will do.

233
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,560
If you don't cut, I'll need to speak French.

234
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,400
Did you get carried away?

235
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,120
What about it?

236
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:26,480
You're good.

237
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:27,600
Thanks, Director.

238
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,200
I'm not talking about you.

239
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,760
I meant Mr. Huang.

240
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:32,360
In the past,

241
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:35,640
I only heard about true artists.

242
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:36,520
Today,

243
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:38,440
I witnessed one in person.

244
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,240
You're flattering me.

245
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:41,200
Honestly, I could have done better.

246
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,480
How about

247
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:45,040
we take a look?

248
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,040
Director,

249
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:47,680
we don't have much time.

250
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,120
Right. I see.

251
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:50,840
Excuse me.

252
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:53,280
Alright, Director. I'll see you soon.

253
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:55,000
Safe flight!

254
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,280
Thanks for your time, Mr. Huang.

255
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:59,720
It's been an honor.

256
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,480
What's your name?

257
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:03,080
My name is Bao Xue.

258
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:05,680
Can I see your whole face?

259
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,080
You should play an old woman.

260
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,680
The pot is here!

261
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:20,320
Brother,

262
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,680
would you like beer or wine?

263
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,720
Hot pot goes perfectly with wine.

264
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,600
Nothing is better than a bottle of Lang.

265
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,520
Did you invite Bao Xue?

266
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,600
I told her when we wrapped up.

267
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,760
If she comes, we'll just add a pair of chopsticks.

268
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:31,880
If not, that's fine, too.

269
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:33,480
Let me tell her.

270
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,000
Oh, another thing.

271
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,560
The director asked me to have dinner
 with the sponsors.

272
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:47,320
Cheers.

273
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:47,920
Cheers.

274
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,280
It must be Bao Xue.

275
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:53,840
Jade.

276
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:55,240
It might be the director.

277
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,000
I'll go.

278
00:13:58,960 --> 00:13:59,880
That's impossible.

279
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,200
Who is that?

280
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,440
What kind of ghost is that?

281
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:30,760
Hey!

282
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:32,640
It was you, wasn't it?

283
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:36,000
I was what?

284
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,240
What are you talking about?

285
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:37,960
Fine.

286
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:39,560
Continue your show.

287
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,680
Do you think I'm an idiot?

288
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,160
What show?

289
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,320
I don't know what you're talking about.

290
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:47,440
Do you think I couldn't recognize this?

291
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,240
You've gone too far.

292
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:51,840
Come.

293
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:52,720
Let's join the guys.

294
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:53,600
Jade,

295
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,440
did I scare the hell out of Liu Liangzhou?

296
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,200
I was scared to death myself, let alone him.

297
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,280
This mask

298
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,360
is just awesome!

299
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,520
Enough. Let's go.

300
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:04,680
You have to apologize to him.

301
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:09,600
Now, when I see your face,

302
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,160
I only see that scary mask.

303
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:15,520
Sorry for my recklessness.

304
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:18,120
I beg your pardon, heroes.

305
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:20,440
I'd like to apologize with this wine.

306
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:21,920
One bottle.

307
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:22,760
Don't be silly.

308
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:23,600
We don't even have one bottle.

309
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:25,280
Don't even think you can beat me in drinking.

310
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:26,520
Maybe you'll be under the table

311
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:28,240
before you have a taste of any dish.

312
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:29,200
I'll take this one.

313
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,040
No need.

314
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:31,200
This is real wine.

315
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:32,240
Don't worry.

316
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:33,360
Are you serious?

317
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,000
That's enough.

318
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:35,920
Apologies accepted.

319
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,200
Sit down and eat.

320
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:39,360
Jade is the best.

321
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,120
I need to use the bathroom.

322
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,200
Liu Liangzhou.

323
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,360
I didn't expect

324
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:50,560
that you were scared to death.

325
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,040
Maybe you should drink.

326
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:53,560
Wine makes a coward bold.

327
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:54,800
Nonsense.

328
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:56,320
I'm not a coward.

329
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,480
Why don't you try it?

330
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:58,640
Sure.

331
00:15:58,640 --> 00:15:59,480
Listen.

332
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:00,960
I'm more daring than you are.

333
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,440
If someone scares me like that,

334
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:03,800
I'll just hit him.

335
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,120
I have a cousin.

336
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,280
She'll just kick his ass.

337
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:08,120
Brag as much as you like.

338
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:09,280
Alright, you two.

339
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:10,920
Let's raise our glasses.

340
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:12,680
We need to thank Bao Xue

341
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,240
for saving our day.

342
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,120
Come on. Cheers.

343
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,960
It was my honor.

344
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:18,120
Anyway, when we were wrapping up,

345
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:19,400
the director did praise you.

346
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:20,720
He thinks you are good.

347
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:23,360
Like this?

348
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:31,600
One. Two. Three. Four. Five. Six. Seven.

349
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:36,480
Seven. Six. Five. Four. Three. Two. One.

350
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:38,920
Jack. Queen. King. Ace.

351
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,080
Like this?

352
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,440
He is the leading actor even if he only counts numbers.

353
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,840
But you'll always be a walk-on however good you are.

354
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:49,200
It's none of your business. I enjoy it.

355
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,360
You should learn how to talk to people.

356
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:53,320
In my opinion,

357
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:54,800
you are both single.

358
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,080
Why don't you two make a couple?

359
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:58,800
I agree.

360
00:16:58,800 --> 00:16:59,920
They are a good match.

361
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:00,720
Don't.

362
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,080
To me,

363
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:05,200
she's just my mate.

364
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,960
And to me, he's not a man.

365
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:13,599
We actually meant the same thing.

366
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,520
Why does it sound so unpleasant

367
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,079
when you say it?

368
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:20,280
Because the Chinese language is so profound.

369
00:17:22,599 --> 00:17:23,599
Cheers, mate.

370
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:26,560
Cheers,

371
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:27,960
sis.

372
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:28,079
Sis?

373
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:34,520
Where are you going?

374
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:36,240
I'm going to work.

375
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,440
What kind of work do you need to do at this hour?

376
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:40,760
I'll have dinner with my boss
to talk about some business.

377
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,120
I'm off, Grandma.

378
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:43,120
See you.

379
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:48,240
It's so early. This must be a big deal.

380
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,440
Shanshan,

381
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,160
Zhao passed away.

382
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:56,400
Hello?

383
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:01,880
When?

384
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:03,520
Early in the morning.

385
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:06,920
Was he ill?

386
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:08,480
Suicide.

387
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:17,680
The annual investment
in high-tech manufacturing industry

388
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:18,560
and equipment manufacturing industry

389
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:21,600
has increased by 17%

390
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,120
and 8.6% respectively than the previous year,

391
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,440
the growth rates being 2.8%

392
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,840
and 4.2%.

393
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,760
The high-end development
of the manufacturing industry is gaining momentum.

394
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:32,880
The renewal of old capacity
and the development of new capacity are accelerating.

395
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:36,200
Investment in energy-intensive 
manufacturing industries has declined from last year.

396
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,080
China has implemented

397
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:39,080
agreed tariffs on part of the products

398
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:40,320
originating from twenty-three
 countries and regions.

399
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,160
Therefore, we suggest increasing positions

400
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,520
in the companies

401
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,840
involved in the sourcing and import and export

402
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:48,000
of the related ninety-four raw materials.

403
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,880
These are the latest trends.

404
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:51,720
Ms. You, what do you think?

405
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,400
A smart man does not stand by a crumbling wall.

406
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,800
Just go with the flow.

407
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:00,760
OK.

408
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,400
One more thing.

409
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:05,520
The cloud service we are using

410
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:06,440
is about to expire.

411
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:09,400
If we switch to the vendor recommended by Mr. Zhao,

412
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,400
we can save a lot more than before.

413
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,680
But recently,

414
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:13,960
I couldn't get in touch with him.

415
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:17,040
So I would like to seek your opinion.

416
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:18,520
Renew the current service.

417
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:19,800
OK.

418
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:21,760
Then do I need to tell Mr. Zhao

419
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:22,400
that we've made our decision?

420
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,200
No need.

421
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,240
Just do as I said.

422
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,280
Sure.

423
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,400
Ms. You, Mr. Ge is here.

424
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:31,480
He's waiting outside.

425
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:32,640
Let him in.

426
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:33,800
OK.

427
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:45,240
About two years ago, Zhao borrowed 
two thousand from me

428
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:46,680
and said he would return it in half a year.

429
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,240
But one year passed and he didn't return it.

430
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:49,800
Do you know

431
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:52,800
that my company wasn't doing well last year?

432
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:56,240
I really had no choice

433
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,600
but to ask him about that money.

434
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:58,880
He returned the money bit by bit

435
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,360
and finally repaid all of it by last month.

436
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:02,800
To be honest,

437
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:04,560
I didn't mean to push him.

438
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,600
I know he was not doing well.

439
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,240
But I also have a life to live.

440
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:11,440
I didn't expect he would...

441
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,400
If I had known,

442
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,400
I would never have asked about the money.

443
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,680
He's gone already.

444
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,880
You don't need to blame yourself.

445
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:28,240
It didn't take him one day to make that decision.

446
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:29,600
Actually, a while ago,

447
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:32,080
I ran into him at the racecourse.

448
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:34,960
He and his daughter were riding horses.

449
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:37,040
At that time,

450
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:39,560
he seemed perfectly fine.

451
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:48,160
I feel I am also responsible for this.

452
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:50,560
Usually,

453
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:52,800
we only asked him about his work,

454
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:53,800
about whether he made money.

455
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:56,480
No one asked him if he was happy.

456
00:21:58,640 --> 00:21:59,800
Shanshan,

457
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,240
how much did he owe you?

458
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:05,960
Not much.

459
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:07,360
What are you gonna do?

460
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:08,600
What can I do?

461
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:09,720
Just let it go.

462
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,280
Let it go?

463
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:14,360
This is not a small figure.

464
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:18,360
I heard that he had a store,

465
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:20,000
which may be worth five or six million.

466
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,560
Shanshan, I'm not taking advantage.

467
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:27,120
One has to pay off his debt. It's just natural.

468
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:28,720
If there is a chance,

469
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,560
maybe we should take a shot.

470
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:39,160
It was Bin who introduced me to this circle.

471
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:42,200
If it wasn't for him, I wouldn't be who I am today.

472
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:45,080
Just let it go.

473
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:48,080
Have some respect for the deceased.

474
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,280
What?

475
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:57,640
Nothing.

476
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,200
Shanshan,

477
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:01,600
I'm

478
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:04,080
impressed.

479
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:21,160
In the past year,

480
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:22,160
he had many sleepless nights.

481
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:25,800
He often sat in the living room sighing.

482
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:27,680
At first,

483
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,840
I thought he was just stressed out by his work.

484
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:33,080
I knew he owed you both money.

485
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:36,440
Before the Spring Festival, Ge came here once.

486
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:40,600
They had a fight in the study.

487
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,240
It was a big fight.

488
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:46,040
After Ge left,

489
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:48,160
I asked him what it was about.

490
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:50,680
But he wouldn't tell me.

491
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,480
Sister,

492
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:01,920
I really didn't expect

493
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:04,160
that Bin would make this choice.

494
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,360
If I had noticed anything

495
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:07,960
and talked to him, he wouldn't have...

496
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:09,080
Shanshan,

497
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:12,240
it's just fate.

498
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:16,040
Aunt, have some water.

499
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:18,520
Thanks, Tianyi.

500
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:23,920
Sister,

501
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:25,720
please don't blame Ge.

502
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:27,880
It was difficult for him, too.

503
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:34,200
I don't blame him.

504
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:39,160
Half a year ago, he insisted on our divorce.

505
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:42,360
He said he didn't want to drag me and Tianyi in.

506
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:45,200
He also planned
to transfer the ownership of the house to me.

507
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:49,160
I knew something went wrong.

508
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:52,160
But he wouldn't tell me a word.

509
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:55,160
He said he would re-marry me after everything was over.

510
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:57,920
I thought I didn't want him to get upset,

511
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:59,280
so I agreed.

512
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:05,160
Last month, he was sued.

513
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:06,720
Then I knew

514
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:10,760
it was something serious.

515
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
I told him

516
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:20,280
that if it was about debt, we could just sell the house

517
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:23,440
to repay as much as we can.

518
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:26,160
Compared to the hard days we've been through,

519
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:28,520
this was nothing.

520
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:31,160
But he just wouldn't agree.

521
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:32,720
He even told me

522
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,920
that he found a solution.

523
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:38,160
That weekend,

524
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:41,160
we went on a trip for two days.

525
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:44,680
Then, he sent me and the kid to my mom's.

526
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:48,560
He said he had some business to deal with

527
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:50,520
and would pick us up later.

528
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:54,920
The next day, I kept calling him

529
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,600
but he never answered.

530
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:03,240
When I came home,

531
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,800
I saw him

532
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:11,040
hanging in the garage.

533
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,920
I'm so sorry.

534
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:29,160
I know he owed you a lot of money.

535
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:33,280
I will sell this house

536
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:34,680
and pay the plaintiff back first

537
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:36,240
so that the court will unfreeze the store.

538
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:38,280
Then I'll sell the store to repay you.

539
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:39,160
Sister,

540
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,440
you took me wrong.

541
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,120
I didn't come to ask for the money.

542
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:49,120
Bin is gone.

543
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:51,600
But you and Tianyi need to go on.

544
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:53,920
You can't sell the house.

545
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,360
Sister, if you allow me,

546
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:02,160
I will help you sell the store at market price

547
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:04,560
and you can use that money to repay the plaintiff

548
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:06,240
so that he can withdraw the charge.

549
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,360
Whenever you come across any difficulty,

550
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:09,920
let me know.

551
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:13,720
How can I do this, Shanshan?

552
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:14,440
I won't.

553
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:16,280
Sister,

554
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:17,680
I've said it many times.

555
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:22,080
I'll always be grateful to Bin.

556
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:35,920
Grandma,

557
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:36,920
you have something to say to me?

558
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:38,840
Take a seat.

559
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:43,480
We need to talk.

560
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:46,080
About what?

561
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:48,920
Where did you get those

562
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:51,000
expensive clothes and handbags?

563
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,280
Grandma!

564
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:53,960
How could you go through my stuff?

565
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:57,400
If something questionable has come into my house,

566
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:59,120
I want to know where it's from.

567
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:00,800
What do you mean by "questionable"?

568
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:02,480
I didn't steal them.

569
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:03,720
How did you buy it?

570
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:04,680
With money, of course.

571
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:05,720
Where did you get the money?

572
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:07,600
I earned it!

573
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:08,440
I told you

574
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:09,880
I have a job now.

575
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:11,640
What on earth have you been doing?

576
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:14,920
Every now and then, you went out in the evening

577
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:18,360
being all glamorous.

578
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:20,960
Then you came back
in the middle of the night smelling like alcohol.

579
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,800
Tell me the truth.

580
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,480
What is your job?

581
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:26,120
Public relations.

582
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:28,720
What do you do specifically?

583
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:32,800
Grandma, why are you interrogating me like a criminal?

584
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:36,360
I just accompany my boss
to talk business with our clients.

585
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:38,160
In what kind of place?

586
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:39,600
Over dinner.

587
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:42,360
So you make money by eating and drinking?

588
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,480
That's just part of my job.

589
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:47,640
You're a healthy young lady.

590
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:50,640
Why can't you just find a decent job?

591
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:54,840
How is this job not decent?

592
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,360
I have my salary and social securities.

593
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:00,400
I also have a bonus for each deal I contribute to.

594
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:02,680
Don't make it sound so noble.

595
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:04,920
Do you think I know nothing at all?

596
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:07,560
This is called a professional escort.

597
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:10,240
It's illegal.

598
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:11,440
Wait a second.

599
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:14,520
Do you think I'm an escort?

600
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,280
What's the difference?

601
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:18,480
What kind of grandma would say something like this?

602
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,360
If you hadn't done those things
that humiliated our family,

603
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:21,680
I wouldn't have said that.

604
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:23,720
Humiliate our family?

605
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:24,400
Correct.

606
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:26,480
You used that word on me?

607
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:28,200
Yes.

608
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:31,600
I have a normal job
 and I need to meet clients sometimes.

609
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,680
I didn't pick up any bad habits.

610
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:36,600
I never spent a whole night outside,
 nor did I steal or anything.

611
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:38,000
How did I humiliate our family?

612
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,640
I think you've gone too far, Grandma.

613
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:41,120
Don't give me that.

614
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:42,360
This is for your own good.

615
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:44,640
Either you quit your job,

616
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,680
or you move out. I can't stand seeing you like this.

617
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:49,000
If anyone knew it, how would they see me?

618
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:51,040
OK.

619
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:53,120
I'll move out.

620
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:55,040
I won't bother you anymore. You happy?

621
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:59,400
Look at you.

622
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:01,520
You don't have a decent job

623
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:04,120
and you don't know how to manage your life.

624
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:06,440
Who will marry you?

625
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:08,760
Why do I have to get married?

626
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:11,280
Why can't I just live on my own?

627
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:14,280
I'll live the way I want. It's my own business.

628
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:28,320
Where are you going?

629
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:29,720
Shanshan has something to talk to me about.

630
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:30,720
So I'm going to meet her.

631
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:33,960
Shanshan again?

632
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:35,280
She really has something to talk about.

633
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:37,720
Wait a second.

634
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:38,800
Wait.

635
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:40,920
What does she have to talk about

636
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:42,680
except drinking and laughing

637
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:43,760
with those men?

638
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:45,080
What,

639
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:46,320
she plans to find a good match for you

640
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:48,280
and then tear us apart?

641
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:50,600
Who wants to tear us apart?

642
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:52,960
Why are you always so suspicious?

643
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,760
It's just a matter of time if I don't keep an eye on you.

644
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:58,360
Li Xiang!

645
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:00,520
I will never cheat on you because I love you,

646
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:02,120
not because you keep an eye on me.

647
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:03,520
Is this so hard to understand?

648
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:05,280
She's waiting downstairs.

649
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:06,960
You're the one talking nonsense.

650
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:10,280
If you don't tie a tree to a stake,
it won't grow straight. Let alone a human being!

651
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:12,880
So, have I ever tied you up?

652
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:14,440
You don't need to because I am not like you.

653
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:16,960
Whatever you say.

654
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:20,240
Don't come home if you dare!

655
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:39,800
Where are we going?

656
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:40,800
Why are you being mysterious?

657
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:42,240
Enough talk. Just get in.

658
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:16,800
This is the store I talked about.

659
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:19,080
The facilities and the location are both good.

660
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:21,480
You already bought it?

661
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:25,200
You rich girl.

662
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:28,760
What do you think we should do with this place?

663
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:30,920
What about a foot bath center?

664
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:35,160
Great, as long as you're willing to wash someone's feet.

665
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:36,640
Then, a gym?

666
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:39,800
There are already two or three gyms nearby.

667
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:42,120
The smallest of them is twice the size of this place.

668
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:46,280
Or a restaurant?

669
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:49,960
That's a good idea.

670
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:52,720
Then each time we get together,
we don't need to worry how late it gets.

671
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,320
And no one can force us to leave.

672
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:54,880
That's right.

673
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,720
Also, as you have so many friends,
we don't need to worry about the revenue.

674
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:58,600
Then, a restaurant it is.

675
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:02,000
But we need to find a reliable manager.

676
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,920
I don't have time to be here every day.

677
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:05,680
I can try.

678
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:08,080
My family used to run a restaurant.
I have some experience.

679
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:12,880
Congratulations, Manager.

680
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:16,320
You finally have a full-time job.

681
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:19,720
That's a deal.
I'll be the sponsor and you'll be the manager.

682
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:22,480
But I don't want to be your employee.

683
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:24,120
I want to be a shareholder, too.

684
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:26,000
Have you got enough money?

685
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,440
Over the years, you've helped manage my stocks.

686
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:30,600
And I don't spend much.

687
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:32,160
So I've saved around 300,000.

688
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:33,840
300,000!

689
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:35,640
You are certainly good at saving.

690
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:37,160
Of course.

691
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:39,760
Tell me the figures when you have them.

692
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:41,720
I'll invest 300,000. Let me know how many shares I have.

693
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:44,680
Friendship is friendship. Business is business.

694
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:46,240
Great.

695
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,800
Wait for my call.

696
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:58,720
I can't live at Grandma's right now.

697
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:00,960
She did hurt me.

698
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:04,520
She hurt you, so you seek refuge here?

699
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:10,040
Just tell me, do you want me here or not?

700
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:12,400
If not, I'll just live in a hotel.

701
00:34:14,679 --> 00:34:16,400
My place is so small.

702
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:17,800
It's OK when I live alone.

703
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:18,920
But if we both live here,

704
00:34:19,239 --> 00:34:21,080
it's kind of crowded.

705
00:34:21,719 --> 00:34:22,719
Bao Xue,

706
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:25,600
why are you so ungrateful?

707
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:29,639
Did I buy you your first underwear?

708
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:33,320
Did I buy you your first lipstick?

709
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:36,679
And your first pair of heels?

710
00:34:36,679 --> 00:34:38,400
I bought that, too!

711
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:39,480
You've said this a million times.

712
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:40,520
Jesus.

713
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:41,480
What's more,

714
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:43,960
you fought with a boy in your class.

715
00:34:44,199 --> 00:34:46,080
Who gave him a bloody nose?

716
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:47,719
Me!

717
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,360
You ungrateful little thing.

718
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:51,320
Now I see you for what you are.

719
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:53,800
Alright! Could you just stop, please?

720
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,480
I don't want to hear these anymore.

721
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:57,080
You sleep in my bed and I sleep on the couch.

722
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:57,760
OK?

723
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:05,920
Fine.

724
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:30,920
Your calligraphy is really good.

725
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:34,040
Hello.

726
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:35,760
Hello.

727
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:37,200
My name is Bai Jinghui.

728
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:38,160
My name is Lv Zheng.

729
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:39,640
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

730
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:42,880
I often see you here practicing calligraphy.

731
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:44,600
But I never had a close look.

732
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:47,040
You're really good at this.

733
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:48,360
No, I'm just doing it for fun.

734
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:49,600
Are you

735
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:50,840
in the Tai Chi group?

736
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:53,600
No, I'm in the chorus.

737
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:54,840
Come and have some fun.

738
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:57,480
I can't sing.

739
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:00,200
Everyone can sing.

740
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:01,480
We're not doing anything professional.

741
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
Just singing

742
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,560
and practicing breathing.

743
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:06,720
It can also help increase lung capacity.

744
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:08,240
It is said

745
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:10,440
that people who sing often live longer.

746
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:11,000
Really?

747
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:11,680
Sure.

748
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:13,000
I'm afraid

749
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,240
that as soon as I open my mouth,

750
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:16,440
everyone will run away.

751
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:19,000
Alright then.

752
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,280
I won't hold you up any longer.

753
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:22,320
Can I take a picture?

754
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:23,080
Of course.

755
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:28,000
But it dried up.

756
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:31,720
Maybe next time.

757
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:34,160
Sure.

758
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:35,200
Alright.

759
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:36,520
Bye-bye.

760
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:07,520
What are you doing here?

761
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:10,200
I'm jogging nearby.

762
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:11,560
I thought you might be here,

763
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:13,440
so I took the chance

764
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,480
to appreciate the high art of the elders.

765
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:17,000
Where is your sister?

766
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:21,560
I guess so.

767
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:24,800
She couldn't sleep last night.

768
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:26,920
Since you drove her away yesterday,

769
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:29,600
she cried for a whole night and didn't sleep at all.

770
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:32,000
Do you think I'm an idiot?

771
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:34,200
If she was so weak,

772
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:36,600
she wouldn't have been stubborn with me.

773
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:40,920
Fine. I can hide nothing from you.

774
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:43,560
You certainly know your granddaughter well.

775
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:45,640
Grandma,

776
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:47,800
when I lived in your place,

777
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:49,160
I was naughty, too.

778
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:50,360
But why didn't you ask me to move out?

779
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:53,560
Are you seeking compliments?

780
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:56,040
You care about people.

781
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:57,640
You know how to make people happy.

782
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:01,600
You are so different from your sister.

783
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:03,600
Look at her.

784
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:05,600
Every day,

785
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:07,800
if I didn't talk to her,

786
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:10,960
she wouldn't even notice me.

787
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:15,600
She just greeted me once or twice each day.

788
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:19,000
Then she would just play with her phone or computer,

789
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:21,600
or have dinner with someone.

790
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:24,040
Having dinner with clients

791
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:26,040
is part of her job, Grandma.

792
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:27,560
What kind of job is that?

793
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:29,440
When I asked her,

794
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:30,760
she couldn't explain it clearly.

795
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:34,160
If I take a guess, there's nothing good there.

796
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:37,600
Listen.

797
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:40,800
I don't understand the world of the young.

798
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:43,880
But there are two principles you must adhere to.

799
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:45,160
First,

800
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:46,720
don't get yourself into the hospital.

801
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:47,600
Second,

802
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:48,800
don't get yourself into the police station.

803
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:50,800
Then you can rest assured.

804
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:52,640
You don't need to worry about her

805
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:54,480
in terms of self-protection.

806
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:55,400
When she was abroad,

807
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:56,880
she had practiced taekwondo for two years.

808
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:00,200
If you really run into a bad guy,

809
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:02,080
what you've learned

810
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:03,880
can do nothing.

811
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:06,600
You think so?

812
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:08,600
Then you were so tough with her.

813
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:10,400
You drove her away like that yesterday.

814
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:12,080
She had no choice but to pack and leave.

815
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:13,080
Given that she's such a pretty young lady,

816
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:14,720
aren't you worried if she bumps into some bad guy?

817
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:16,240
I didn't drive her away.

818
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:18,600
She left herself.

819
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,280
Plus,

820
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:23,120
she practiced taekwondo, right?

821
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:26,640
Didn't you just say

822
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:28,260
that taekwondo is useless?

823
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:32,400
I know she wouldn't go far away.

824
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:33,600
She must have gone to yours.

825
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:35,840
Your place is not far from mine.

826
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:38,240
So I'm not worried at all.

827
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:41,080
No wonder why you're so calm.

828
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:42,640
You didn't even respond to my messages.

829
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:45,160
Now I know. Because you're a prophet, Grandma!

830
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:47,400
Also, the chorus has plans today,

831
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:49,800
so I went to bed early last night.

832
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:52,240
Alright. I'll talk to you later.

833
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:53,640
I need to go back.

834
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:55,800
You can go home if you're done jogging.

835
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:57,840
Grandma, I want to listen to you singing.

836
00:39:57,840 --> 00:39:59,560
I'll just jog around.

837
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:00,600
Fine.

838
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:02,640
Take care.

839
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:03,280
OK.

840
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:03,880
Alright.

841
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:05,080
Take it easy, Grandma.

842
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:05,800
I will.

843
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:06,600
Enjoy.

844
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:17,280
Hello?

845
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:18,880
Hello.

846
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:21,360
I'm back. Are you home tonight?

847
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:23,200
I think so.

848
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:24,600
Why? Do you want to take me to dinner?

849
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:26,880
I may take you to dinner
after I finish my work in a day or two.

850
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:29,400
My friend gave me some local products.

851
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:30,240
Just let me know where you live.

852
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:31,200
I'll send you some this evening.

853
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:32,920
You'll send me some local products?

854
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:34,600
Wait.

855
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:37,280
Wait a second. I want to confirm something with you.

856
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:40,600
Are you

857
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:41,600
pursuing me?

858
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:43,200
I always see you as my sis.

859
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:45,880
Mate,

860
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:46,760
I pursue you?

861
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:49,600
Are you still in your dream?

862
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:51,600
Just send me the location.

863
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:53,520
Now I'm relieved.

864
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:56,200
Sure. I'll send you the location right now.

865
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:57,800
Thank you, sis.

866
00:40:57,800 --> 00:40:59,080
Take care.

867
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:00,960
Alright. See you.
