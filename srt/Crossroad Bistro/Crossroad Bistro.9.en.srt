3
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:01,960
Search this chef

4
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:03,440
on the internet.

5
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:05,200
Everyone gives him five stars.

6
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,640
They have so many dishes.

7
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,680
It's so difficult to book him

8
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,910
because he's too popular.

9
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:09,520
The food is good.

10
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,840
Come on. Cheers.

11
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:13,600
I haven't seen you for a while.

12
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:18,800
Pepper salt short ribs.

13
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:19,760
Enjoy.

14
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,120
Give me one.

15
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,400
Go on.

16
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:23,960
OK.

17
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,640
I'll have another sip.

18
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:29,240
Come on.

19
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:37,800
Don't touch it.

20
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,120
The knife is sharp.

21
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:41,480
Don't cut yourself.

22
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,240
Cut the crap.

23
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,720
I've used all kinds of sharp knives.

24
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,079
Sure.

25
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:48,320
I know you're an expert.

26
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,400
But the platform has rules.

27
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,480
Customers aren't allowed to touch chefs' stuff.

28
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,600
If you really hurt yourself,

29
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,700
I won't be able to explain myself.

30
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:55,780
Why do you cherish them so much?

31
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:57,520
What's wrong with me playing with the knives?

32
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,360
If you really cut yourself,

33
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,160
it would be bad.

34
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:06,240
Fine.

35
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:07,720
Makes sense.

36
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:08,880
Makes sense.

37
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,080
Alright.

38
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,120
Take a seat.

39
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,560
The last dish will be ready very soon.

40
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:13,920
Do your job.

41
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,080
We complimented you a lot.

42
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,320
Be quick.

43
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:30,360
What were you doing?

44
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:31,600
Nothing much.

45
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,640
I went to the toilet.

46
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:33,360
You missed a cup.

47
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,320
Don't you know?

48
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,160
Drink it now.

49
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:35,680
That's quick.

50
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:36,280
Drink.

51
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:41,760
Will it do?

52
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,720
Sweet and sour mandarin fish.

53
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,320
Put it close to Hu.

54
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:47,040
Here.

55
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,320
Put it over here.

56
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,720
Can you reach it?

57
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:50,560
Yeah.

58
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,640
Alright, dudes.

59
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,160
I've finished cooking.

60
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,480
That's the end of today's service.

61
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,440
Is that all?

62
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,000
Wait a minute.

63
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:01,960
Come on, bro.

64
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,120
A toast to you.

65
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:04,680
Here, drink.

66
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:05,480
The platform has rules.

67
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:07,280
I'm not allowed to drink during service.

68
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,000
Bullshit.

69
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,040
What will happen if you drink?

70
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:10,960
Drink.

71
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,920
It's not convenient because I drove here.

72
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,600
Just use chauffeur service.

73
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:16,040
What's the problem with it?

74
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:17,240
I'm sorry.

75
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,600
Mine is a motorcycle.

76
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,959
I can't get a chauffeur.

77
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,560
You're a damn cook.

78
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:32,440
You're not that different from a damn beggar.

79
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:33,760
What are you so proud of?

80
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,600
We respected you but you don't do the same, right?

81
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,280
You don't let me touch the knives.

82
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,360
You don't drink with us, either.

83
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:42,280
Are you looking down on my bro?

84
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:42,800
Let me tell you.

85
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:43,560
If you don't drink,

86
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,880
the moment you walk out the door,

87
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,120
I will call the police

88
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,480
and say you carry banned knives.

89
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,640
Do you believe me?

90
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,320
Then call the police.

91
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,120
Ertou.

92
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,120
Sit.

93
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,640
Everyone, sit.

94
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:01,720
Let's drink.

95
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,120
Go on. Cheers.

96
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,400
Sorry, dude.

97
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,440
My bro drank too much.

98
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:15,640
Go if you want.

99
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,880
I'm gonna beat you.

100
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,840
Did you drink too much?

101
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:26,160
We're in a society with the rule of law.

102
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,200
Do you know that?

103
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,640
Who do you want to beat?

104
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:30,600
Tell me, who do you want to beat?

105
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,050
Bro.

106
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:32,880
I was just pissed he didn't show respect to you.

107
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,280
Cut the crap.

108
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,360
Just give him a bad review and that's it.

109
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,560
You're stupid.

110
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,960
That's brilliant, Hu.

111
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,560
Genius.

112
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,520
Just think.

113
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:47,600
Good idea.

114
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:49,720
A toast to you.

115
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:50,880
Why didn't I think of that?

116
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,040
Do you get what I mean?

117
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:23,800
Hello.

118
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:27,640
Hello, I'm the customer service staff from Aihao Food.

119
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:29,800
Is it Chef Zhao Henan?

120
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,080
Yes. It's me.

121
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,840
A customer just gave you a bad review.

122
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,440
Do you know about this?

123
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,600
I guessed it.

124
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,480
Our platform focuses on customer service.

125
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:40,640
We do everything to make customers satisfied.

126
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:42,280
We have checked and confirmed

127
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:44,440
the bad review is from a reliable source and it's valid.

128
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:47,159
Please contact the customer and apologize 
 as soon as possible.

129
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:47,940
Wait.

130
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:50,320
Even if you're a service platform, you need to 
 have proper attitudes.

131
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:50,960
Right?

132
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,480
If customers have unreasonable requests,

133
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,800
do I still have to satisfy their needs?

134
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,360
You can refuse unreasonable requests.

135
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,120
But the customer said

136
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,120
he just wanted to check your kitchenware.

137
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,120
That's not an unreasonable request.

138
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:06,320
Please contact the customer and apologize 
 as soon as possible.

139
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:08,200
The platform will follow up with the process.

140
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:10,160
If it went wrong because of my cooking skills

141
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,160
or my service attitude,

142
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,680
I would've taken responsibility for everything 
 that happened.

143
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:15,880
But as for today's matter,

144
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,080
I will never apologize.

145
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:18,800
Mr. Zhao Henan,

146
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,640
if you can't follow the platform's rules

147
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:21,480
and do your job,

148
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,840
we will suspend your right

149
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:25,280
of taking orders.

150
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,000
After you apologize,

151
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:27,520
the platform...

152
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,080
There's no need for suspending anything.

153
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:30,120
I quit.

154
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,000
Are you hungry?

155
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:00,760
No.

156
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:02,600
What about you?

157
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,080
If we don't have a chef, we can't open for business.

158
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:07,600
I don't have any appetite whenever I think about that.

159
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,920
We have to be careful about recruiting chefs.

160
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,160
Put quality before quantity.

161
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,920
But we can't go on like this.

162
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,440
What about I talk to him?

163
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:17,840
Never mind.

164
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,320
It's been a week.

165
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:21,040
You've been texting him every day.

166
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,240
Has he replied to you?

167
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,800
He is difficult to deal with.

168
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,520
But maybe we can find a way.

169
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:31,240
How about we improve the benefits

170
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,159
and raise his salary?

171
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,280
Give me an amount.

172
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:37,120
What's the highest we can afford?

173
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,240
I'll try again.

174
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:42,720
Young comrade.

175
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:47,480
You have a perfect attitude towards your work.

176
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,280
But as someone with experience,

177
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,440
I have to tell you this.

178
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,240
In the world of grown-ups,

179
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:55,130
the sentence "Where there is a will, there is a way"

180
00:08:55,130 --> 00:08:56,560
is a lie.

181
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,120
Hello?

182
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,080
OK.

183
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,680
How about now?

184
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:17,840
We're in the restaurant.

185
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,120
Alright. See you later.

186
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,120
What happened?

187
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,600
Old comrade.

188
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,760
In the world of minors,

189
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:33,800
the sentence "Where there is a will, there is a way"

190
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,360
isn't a lie.

191
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:37,720
Shameless.

192
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,560
You, a minor?

193
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:41,800
He will be here soon.

194
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:46,960
When was the last time you eat?

195
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:47,840
You're starving.

196
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,880
You have no idea.

197
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:52,690
In the past week, we tried to recruit a chef and ate 
 so many big dishes

198
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:55,200
from north to south that we almost got disgusted 
 by them.

199
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,000
The thing is,

200
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,840
not everyone can cook well.

201
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,880
We think most of them are not good at cooking.

202
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,680
The noodle is so tasty.

203
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:03,840
Keep it in mind.

204
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,400
We have to add the noodle to our menu.

205
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,200
OK.

206
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,200
Let's talk.

207
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,920
What changed your mind?

208
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17,800
Is it because Feng Xi

209
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,240
insisted with perseverance

210
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,440
and moved you?

211
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,440
It's part of the reason.

212
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,640
What's the other part of the reason?

213
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:27,560
I have quit the job at the platform.

214
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:28,360
You quit?

215
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,040
That's all of a sudden.

216
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,120
What happened?

217
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:34,240
I won't

218
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,080
mention the reason.

219
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:37,240
It's mainly because I don't want to be idle.

220
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:38,280
Alright.

221
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,520
If you don't want to talk about it,

222
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:40,130
we won't ask.

223
00:10:40,130 --> 00:10:41,560
Then let's talk about salary and benefits.

224
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:42,520
What do you have in mind?

225
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:43,400
Just tell us.

226
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,160
I don't have much in mind.

227
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:46,120
I can accept

228
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,200
your offer before.

229
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,160
However,

230
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,600
I have an additional condition.

231
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:51,480
If you can do that,

232
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:52,400
I can work here.

233
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:55,520
What condition?

234
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:57,840
Trust me with

235
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,120
everything in the kitchen.

236
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,040
You aren't professionals.

237
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:01,160
Don't boss me around.

238
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,200
But you have my words.

239
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:03,720
The things I do

240
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,120
will definitely make you satisfied.

241
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:06,920
No problem.

242
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:11,320
Manager Feng gave you her words.

243
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,760
I raise both hands in approval.

244
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,280
Then,

245
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:16,200
there's nothing else.

246
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,880
When can you be on board?

247
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:18,760
Anytime.

248
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,320
Simple and direct.

249
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,200
We'll sign the contract today.

250
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,840
I have prepared the contract.

251
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:38,840
Alright.

252
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:40,040
Give me the pen.

253
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,480
Don't you want to check the details?

254
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,400
All contracts serve cultured men 
 but not backstabbers.

255
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:46,160
If you trust me,

256
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,280
I trust you too.

257
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:54,680
That's great.

258
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:56,920
You've solved an extreme emergency for us.

259
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:58,720
In this case,

260
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,240
we will be able to open as scheduled.

261
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,440
Then,

262
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,280
see you tomorrow?

263
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:05,360
See you tomorrow.

264
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,000
OK.

265
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,680
Tomorrow is New Year's Eve.

266
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:08,720
Mh.

267
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:09,760
How about this?

268
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:11,040
Rest for another day.

269
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,920
Come to work after the holiday.

270
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:15,240
Sure.

271
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,200
It's settled, then.

272
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,640
May we have a pleasant cooperation.

273
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,680
Pleasant cooperation.

274
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:27,280
[Crossroad Bistro]

275
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,080
Hi.

276
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,040
What's wrong?

277
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:56,160
Are you sick?

278
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:57,920
Who is it?

279
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:00,720
Liu Liangzhou.

280
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:05,640
Liu Liangzhou?

281
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:11,920
Bao Xue is not here.

282
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:13,440
I know.

283
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,360
She told me.

284
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,200
It's the last day of 2018.

285
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,520
I want to buy you lunch.

286
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,560
How about dinner?

287
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:30,000
I went to sleep after three o'clock last night.

288
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,360
I'm too sleepy.

289
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,200
Bye-bye.

290
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:49,640
You're still playing.

291
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:50,600
Why aren't you packing?

292
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:51,560
I'm leaving.

293
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:53,530
Don't ask.

294
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:56,530
The director told us to buy tickets for ourselves

295
00:13:56,530 --> 00:13:58,240
and apply for reimbursement, right?

296
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:58,880
Yeah.

297
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,680
I completely forgot about it.

298
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:02,760
When I remembered it and checked,

299
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:05,040
there were only first-class tickets left.

300
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:06,360
Never mind.

301
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:08,320
I'll go back a few days later.

302
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,320
Are you staying here all alone for New Year's Eve?

303
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:10,900
Yeah.

304
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:13,440
But I think first-class tickets aren't that 
 much more expensive.

305
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,960
And it's so nice to stay with family members 
 on New Year's Eve.

306
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,320
Never mind.

307
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:19,400
There's no need to throw that money away.

308
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:20,340
Also,

309
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:23,320
even the producer and the director bought 
 economy class tickets.

310
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,360
I'm just a supporting actress.

311
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,400
If I'm in the first class,

312
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:26,720
how weird would that be?

313
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:27,680
Off you go.

314
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,960
See you later when you're back.

315
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:30,760
Alright.

316
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:32,120
What you said makes sense.

317
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:33,720
Xue.

318
00:14:35,090 --> 00:14:37,200
I'll leave the One Nest from Yan Palace to you.

319
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,750
It will keep you company on New Year's Eve.

320
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:40,240
Is it a New Year gift?

321
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,400
Thanks.

322
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:43,400
Happy New Year.

323
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:44,520
Bye-bye.

324
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:07,440
This one.

325
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,560
This one?

326
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:09,080
OK.

327
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:10,200
Two circles.

328
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,400
Two circles. Anyone?

329
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,080
I don't recognize the number.

330
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,720
Don't answer these calls at all.

331
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:19,040
They're probably sales promoters.

332
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,280
They could even be swindlers.

333
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:21,440
Two circles.

334
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,040
Two circles again.

335
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:25,520
What an old lady.

336
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:28,080
She has some vigilance.

337
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:31,080
This one.

338
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,240
It's the same number.

339
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:36,680
Take the call.

340
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:39,640
Hello.

341
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:41,760
Hello.

342
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:42,520
Is it

343
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:44,600
Ms. Bai Jinghui?

344
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:45,720
Yes.

345
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:46,800
Who's that?

346
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:48,400
Can I help you?

347
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:49,880
Here's the thing.

348
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:50,800
I am from

349
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,760
Hainan People's Hospital.

350
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:55,840
Do you have a relative named Bao Xue?

351
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:56,840
Yes.

352
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:58,040
What happened to her?

353
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:00,640
When she was filming in Hainan,

354
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:01,920
she was injured.

355
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:03,760
Injured?

356
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:04,640
Is it serious?

357
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:05,680
What kind of injury?

358
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:09,000
It's really serious.

359
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,920
Her eyes were

360
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:13,600
hurt by some poisonous gas.

361
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:14,560
Eyes?

362
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:17,480
She needs a retinal transplant.

363
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:19,200
You have to send 20,000 RMB.

364
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,400
If you don't do it in time,

365
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:22,400
she will lose her eyesight.

366
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:23,960
Doctor,

367
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:24,880
I'm sorry.

368
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:27,200
I didn't hear you clearly.

369
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,200
What was the

370
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:30,400
surgery you talked about that Bao Xue needs?

371
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:33,720
It's a retinal transplant.

372
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:36,560
You swindlers.

373
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:38,560
You only deceive old people.

374
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:41,680
Let me tell you.

375
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:44,240
I've been working in hospitals all my life.

376
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:46,240
I have never heard of

377
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,840
any retinal transplant.

378
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:50,800
Even if you are a swindler,

379
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,720
you have to learn something professional.

380
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:53,600
She's so evil.

381
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:54,640
I will call the police now.

382
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:55,840
Don't do it.

383
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:56,680
Granny, it's me.

384
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:57,560
It's me, Xue.

385
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:58,920
I was joking with you.

386
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,400
You're such a naughty kid.

387
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:05,200
Do you want to scare me to death?

388
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:07,760
If it wasn't for Doctor Lv,

389
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,400
I would've fallen into your trap.

390
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:11,839
Even if you did, it would be okay.

391
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:13,359
It's called

392
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:15,000
charity begins at home.

393
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:16,680
Where are you?

394
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,680
I'm still in Hainan.

395
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:21,440
Didn't you say you will be back today?

396
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,800
But I haven't finished filming.

397
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,560
I will be back after I finish filming.

398
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:26,880
Granny.

399
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:30,480
I can't stay with you on New Year's Eve this year.

400
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,520
Do you miss me?

401
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:34,400
Even if I do, you can't come back.

402
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:36,480
What about you?

403
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:37,880
Is there anyone with you?

404
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,120
Yeah.

405
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,320
There're many people in the crew here.

406
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:41,960
Rest assured.

407
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,080
I won't starve.

408
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:45,200
Good, then.

409
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,240
Stop trying to scare me.

410
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,920
How old am I?

411
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,760
What if anything happens to me?

412
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,000
Alright, I know.

413
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,880
I'm sorry, okay?

414
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:55,520
But, granny,

415
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:56,680
I really have to

416
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:58,320
praise you seriously.

417
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,080
I am so happy that

418
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,160
you went through the challenge.

419
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:03,880
The challenge?

420
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:05,880
You're so annoying.

421
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:06,920
Granny,

422
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:09,320
I have to hand over the important task of

423
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:11,680
keeping you company on New Year's Eve to my sis, then.

424
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:13,240
You have to promise me.

425
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:14,840
Don't argue when you meet each other.

426
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:15,920
Okay?

427
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:17,800
If I get angry so easily,

428
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,520
I'd be pissed to death long ago.

429
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:22,240
I want her to be good.

430
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,000
Yes. She surely knows.

431
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,120
Anyways,

432
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,040
when you meet,

433
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:27,000
you have to be good.

434
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,200
Don't argue.

435
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,000
After I finish filming here,

436
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,920
I will come back to you immediately.

437
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:33,920
Granny, I won't talk to you.

438
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,360
The filming will begin soon.

439
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:36,520
Hereby I wish you

440
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:38,400
a happy New Year.

441
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,000
I love you.

442
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:40,840
OK.

443
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:41,840
Happy New Year.

444
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:44,520
What a kid.

445
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:45,680
She's so annoying.

446
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:03,360
Hello.

447
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,040
Hello, sister.

448
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:05,960
I found out

449
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:08,480
there's a mysterious male intellectual 
 at granny's place.

450
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,640
When you go back tonight, do thorough research for me.

451
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:11,720
If there's any news,

452
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:12,800
tell me any time.

453
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:13,680
Do you understand?

454
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,720
Don't be paranoid.

455
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,200
What gossip can there be?

456
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:19,920
They just play Mahjong together.

457
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:21,840
I just woke up.

458
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:22,960
I will go back soon.

459
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:26,000
I've told granny just now.

460
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,320
Be good when you meet each other.

461
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:28,960
Don't make her angry.

462
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,520
Whatever she says or does,

463
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:31,520
it for your good.

464
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:32,720
Do you understand?

465
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,040
Yes.

466
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:35,120
She's my grandma.

467
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:37,000
Do you think I'm really upset with her?

468
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:38,640
You're so sentimental.

469
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:39,360
Alright.

470
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:40,090
That's it, then.

471
00:19:40,090 --> 00:19:41,660
I wish you a happy New Year in advance.

472
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:42,600
I'll hang up.

473
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:43,240
Bye-bye.

474
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:44,520
Bye-bye.

475
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,200
Xiaoyu.

476
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,120
Why are you here?

477
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:17,760
I'm picking you up for dinner.

478
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,480
When did I agree?

479
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:21,520
At noon.

480
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:22,920
I asked you out for lunch.

481
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:24,160
You were still in bed.

482
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:25,760
So we changed to dinner.

483
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,520
I forgot.

484
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,280
Have you been waiting since noon?

485
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,560
I don't have anything to do, anyways.

486
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:34,000
So I took a nap in the car.

487
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:36,880
I am so sorry.

488
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:38,800
But I've promised my grandma

489
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:40,120
to go back for dinner.

490
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:43,160
It's okay.

491
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,240
I can drive you there.

492
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,840
I already feel so bad for standing you up.

493
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:48,440
I'll just call a cab.

494
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:50,340
It's really okay.

495
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:51,400
If I go back alone at this time,

496
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:52,720
the traffic will be bad anyway.

497
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,810
Just think of it as keeping me company and talking to me.

498
00:20:54,810 --> 00:20:55,560
Get in the car.

499
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:56,920
Alright, then.

500
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:08,200
How are your grandparents on your dad's side?

501
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,720
My grandpa passed away ten years ago.

502
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,440
My grandma lives alone now.

503
00:21:15,970 --> 00:21:18,240
Then why don't we take your grandma out for dinner?

504
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,000
It's my treat.

505
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:21,240
That's too much.

506
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:23,040
No, it's not.

507
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:24,240
It's more fun with more people.

508
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,920
I'll drive you back after dinner.

509
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:27,560
Call her now.

510
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:28,920
Don't make her cook.

511
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:37,920
It's so heavy.

512
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:40,200
Is it made of hardwood?

513
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,400
It's quite heavy.

514
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:44,160
It's a piece of old furniture left by my father.

515
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:46,520
I normally move it with friends I play Mahjong with.

516
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:47,880
Now that you're here,

517
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,960
I won't trouble them.

518
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:55,680
See you.

519
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:58,240
Lv.

520
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:00,440
What's wrong?

521
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:03,600
It's okay.

522
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:04,440
I'll go.

523
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:08,600
Why are you less straightforward than a woman?

524
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:10,360
Just tell me what it is.

525
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:12,560
To be honest,

526
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:14,880
it's nothing serious.

527
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,080
Nothing serious?

528
00:22:16,930 --> 00:22:19,440
Then I wish to know what flirtatious thing 
 you have in mind.

529
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:20,520
Flirtatious?

530
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:22,560
No.

531
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:23,840
I didn't mean that.

532
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,480
Here it is.

533
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,280
It's New Year's Day tomorrow, right?

534
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,120
I was just thinking about

535
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:31,800
having dinner

536
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:32,680
with you

537
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:34,080
tonight.

538
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:38,200
My granddaughter will come back this evening.

539
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,600
If you don't mind,

540
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:41,960
let's have dinner together.

541
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:44,400
Then I won't bother you.

542
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:46,640
What about tomorrow?

543
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:49,480
My normal university 
 will have a classmate reunion party tomorrow.

544
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:51,240
I was just thinking

545
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:52,120
should I go or not?

546
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:53,720
Then will you go

547
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:54,400
or...

548
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,240
Xiaoyu.

549
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:01,320
Will you come back for dinner?

550
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:08,520
I won't go.

551
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,520
It's a gathering of young people.

552
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:11,920
What am I there for?

553
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:13,200
No, I won't go.

554
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:15,120
Have fun.

555
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,840
New Year's Day isn't the same as Spring Festival.

556
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:21,000
It doesn't matter.

557
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:22,840
Don't worry about me.

558
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:27,000
Drink less.

559
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:28,680
Be safe.

560
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,520
No matter who you got it from,

561
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:33,200
you shouldn't drink too often.

562
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:34,920
OK.

563
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:36,080
Rest assured.

564
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:36,640
OK.

565
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:38,920
Happy New Year.

566
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:43,520
She has something to do and won't come back.

567
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:45,120
Let's keep each other company.

568
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:46,640
Alright.

569
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:47,800
To eat with them

570
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:49,480
is like icing on the cake.

571
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:50,400
But to eat with you

572
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,080
is like offering fuel in snowy weather.

573
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:52,920
Tell me,

574
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:54,640
am I right?

575
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,040
Completely.

576
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,320
There's a new restaurant

577
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:01,920
outside the south gate of the park.

578
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:04,640
Shall we go there for dinner?

579
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:05,800
We're not going anywhere.

580
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:07,360
Tonight,

581
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:08,560
I will make you

582
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:09,800
the big dumplings

583
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:11,000
with Bai's recipe.

584
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,760
I really look forward to it.

585
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:15,080
What should I prepare?

586
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:17,520
Just prepare your appetite.

587
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:47,920
Have you had dinner?

588
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:48,720
Yes.

589
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:35,160
It's complete.

590
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,400
Years go by.

591
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:47,000
Time flies.

592
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:48,720
Yeah.

593
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,480
After my husband passed away,

594
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:53,080
I dreaded the New Year.

595
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:56,240
It reminds me of so many things

596
00:26:58,280 --> 00:26:59,760
and makes me uncomfortable.

597
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:02,080
It's the same with me.

598
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:04,080
On normal days,

599
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,280
it feels alright.

600
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:08,600
But when the festivals come,

601
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:17,520
I just feel

602
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,240
really lonely.

603
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,320
In the future,

604
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:31,760
let's

605
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:34,520
keep each other company on New Year's Eve.

606
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:37,200
OK.

607
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:43,160
This year feels

608
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:46,200
so heartwarming.

609
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,400
Thank you.

610
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:55,560
Are there any seats left?

611
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:56,920
Yes. Just a moment.

612
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:59,080
Hey handsome,

613
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:00,560
can I ask you something?

614
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:02,190
Do you think you can share the table

615
00:28:02,190 --> 00:28:03,080
with the beauty over here?

616
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:04,190
There're many customers tonight.

617
00:28:04,190 --> 00:28:05,040
The tables are all taken.

618
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,360
No problem. Come here. Sit.

619
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:07,650
Thank you, take a seat.

620
00:28:07,650 --> 00:28:09,080
It's nice to have good business.

621
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:09,970
What do you want to order?

622
00:28:09,970 --> 00:28:12,120
0.15kg of three delicacies stuffed dumplings, 
 please. Thanks.

623
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:12,800
Alright.

624
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:15,080
Three delicacies stuffed dumplings. Here.

625
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:16,520
Thanks.

626
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:18,040
Here. Hot dumplings.

627
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:19,160
Three delicacies stuffed.

628
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:20,840
That's great.

629
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:21,680
Here's the dish.

630
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:22,880
Thanks.

631
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:26,360
What's wrong?

632
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:28,480
This is for him.

633
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:31,720
I'm so sorry.

634
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:32,480
Sorry.

635
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:33,480
I was just...

636
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:33,990
It's alright.

637
00:28:33,990 --> 00:28:34,940
They're all dumplings.

638
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:35,680
Eat first.

639
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:37,040
Thank you, then.

640
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:37,640
Alright.

641
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:39,080
Yours will be served soon.

642
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:41,640
I'm so sorry.

643
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:42,320
I was too hungry.

644
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,440
I ordered three delicacies stuffed dumplings, too.

645
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:45,720
Eat mine later on.

646
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:46,200
It's alright.

647
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:47,280
Eat them since you're hungry.

648
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:49,080
I'm so sorry.

649
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:51,000
Here.

650
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:53,200
Ms. Bai.

651
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:54,720
Here's a toast

652
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:55,520
to you.

653
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:57,440
I have to thank you.

654
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:58,240
Doctor Lv,

655
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,800
It's alright.

656
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:01,800
Our kids are not around.

657
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:03,160
We keep each other company.

658
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:05,040
Don't thank me.

659
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:06,080
I also need to

660
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:07,120
thank you.

661
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:07,840
Don't say that.

662
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:08,480
Cheers.

663
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,240
Bottoms up.

664
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:12,920
Taste it.

665
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:13,680
OK.

666
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,120
It's so delicious.

667
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:23,880
Ms. Bai.

668
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:26,120
They're the most delicious

669
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,120
dumplings

670
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:28,560
I've ever had in 70 years.

671
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:31,040
Really?

672
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:31,760
Yes.

673
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:33,280
I'll have another one.

674
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:36,840
Slow down.

675
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:38,440
No one is taking it away from you.

676
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:39,480
We're not in a hurry.

677
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:40,520
You're right.

678
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:41,920
I'm just

679
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:44,120
planning to leave before midnight.

680
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:45,640
Do you mind?

681
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:46,640
Sure.

682
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:48,520
Is there any reason behind it?

683
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:49,720
Nothing much.

684
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:52,200
It's just after midnight,

685
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:53,440
we will

686
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:57,200
know each other for two years.

687
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:10,880
Thanks.

688
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:11,960
Here.

689
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:23,660
Coming.

690
00:30:23,660 --> 00:30:24,560
Here come the dumplings.

691
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:25,520
Here.

692
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:26,840
Have these, instead.

693
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:28,120
Great.

694
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:29,880
That was fun, eating the wrong dumplings.

695
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:30,560
I am so sorry.

696
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:31,280
It's okay.

697
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:32,080
I'm sorry.

698
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,280
Eat it while it's hot.

699
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:34,960
Then I'll start eating if you don't mind.

700
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,480
Don't say it like that.

701
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:39,280
You should have the dumplings first.

702
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:40,800
I am so sorry.

703
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:48,400
To be honest,

704
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:52,800
I think the dumplings they make are just average.

705
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:54,680
They can't compare with the ones my grandma makes.

706
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:57,800
Judging from your accent,

707
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:59,000
are you from the north?

708
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:00,800
Are you from the north too?

709
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,400
Many friends around me

710
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,260
are northerners, too.

711
00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:05,160
When it comes to dumplings,

712
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:07,160
people all think their mom,

713
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:08,200
or grandma,

714
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,400
or wife makes the best dumplings.

715
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:12,080
But my granny does make the best dumplings.

716
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:14,160
I mean it. I'm not bragging.

717
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:15,760
My granny is so good at making the stuffing.

718
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:17,500
When you bite the dumplings after she boils them,

719
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:19,120
the whole block can smell how nice they are.

720
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:20,720
When you say it like that,

721
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,670
even I want to eat the dumplings your granny makes.

722
00:31:22,670 --> 00:31:24,840
You can feel how delicious they are 
 through my account, right?

723
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:26,300
Through your account, yeah.

724
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:26,920
It's not just him,

725
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:27,880
even I want to eat those.

726
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:30,680
Dear sir.

727
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:31,760
I'm so sorry.

728
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:33,320
Please don't mind.

729
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:34,240
Although in my mind,

730
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:36,000
my granny's dumplings indeed taste better,

731
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:36,800
the thing is

732
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:38,800
water afar quenches not fire.

733
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:39,520
It's New Year's Eve.

734
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:40,720
To find a seat

735
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:42,400
and eat your dumplings

736
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,270
already make me feel so happy.

737
00:31:44,270 --> 00:31:45,280
Nothing wrong with that.

738
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:46,560
You're totally right.

739
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:47,360
Homemade dumplings

740
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:49,250
are always tastier than those in restaurants.

741
00:31:49,250 --> 00:31:49,840
Right.

742
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:50,600
Today,

743
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:51,320
some customers

744
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:52,520
are northerners, too.

745
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,400
They can't eat homemade dumplings.

746
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:55,440
So they make do with mine.

747
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:56,560
At least

748
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:58,040
it feels a bit like home, right?

749
00:31:58,040 --> 00:31:59,720
That's not make do at all.

750
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:00,240
Bro.

751
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:01,880
You're doing charity.

752
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:03,200
Charity?

753
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:03,760
Sis,

754
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:04,880
you're so good at words.

755
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:06,400
I'm not.

756
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:08,320
Right. Just for the sake of your words,

757
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:10,320
I'll offer you a plate of dumplings for free, okay?

758
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:11,960
That's so kind of you.

759
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:13,040
Then I'll take it.

760
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:13,800
Of course.

761
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:14,910
What stuffing would you like?

762
00:32:14,910 --> 00:32:16,050
Can I have pickled mustard green?

763
00:32:16,050 --> 00:32:16,560
Of course.

764
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:17,620
I'll eat whatever you serve.

765
00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:18,160
Alright.

766
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:20,560
Wait.

767
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:22,600
The two of you

768
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:23,880
meet by chance.

769
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:24,720
Are you going to

770
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:25,960
just chat?

771
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:27,440
What else?

772
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:28,720
Drink something, at least.

773
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:30,280
Dumplings go well with alcohol.

774
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:31,280
Right?

775
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:32,560
It makes sense.

776
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:33,400
Right?

777
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:34,560
I can drink.

778
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:36,040
Can you drink?

779
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:37,400
I can.

780
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:40,480
Let's each have a bottle of

781
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:42,040
Little Lang Liquor. How about that?

782
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:42,640
OK.

783
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:43,190
Sir.

784
00:32:43,190 --> 00:32:44,760
Two bottles of Little Lang Liquor.

785
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:46,000
Sure.

786
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:48,840
I even have to remind you of this.

787
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:50,440
Good job reminding.

788
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:04,240
What are you laughing at?

789
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:08,960
Do all men fancy women like that?

790
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:13,320
Stop kidding me.

791
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:15,320
Then why did you check her?

792
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:16,720
You were so absorbed.

793
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:20,720
I was wondering

794
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:22,080
does she realize

795
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:24,240
her plastic surgery is too much?

796
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:26,920
But don't many actors and actresses do 
 plastic surgeries?

797
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:28,200
Trust me, it's not true.

798
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:30,440
They just adjust a bit,

799
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:31,600
like tattooing eyebrows,

800
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:32,680
injecting BOTOX

801
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:34,000
and doing a bit of Rhinoplasty.

802
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,640
They do it to look good on camera.

803
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:37,960
Actors and actresses need to have unique features.

804
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:40,680
She can't be an actress.

805
00:33:40,890 --> 00:33:42,520
She should be a social media influencer.

806
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:44,360
All those influencers look the same.

807
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:46,280
You did quite some research on this.

808
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:48,170
Not really.

809
00:33:48,170 --> 00:33:49,880
I just always hear people talking about it.

810
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:54,360
Which do you think is better,

811
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:56,200
slightly adjusted faces

812
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,920
or natural ones?

813
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:04,320
Natural faces

814
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:07,400
are very difficult to define, to begin with.

815
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:09,639
It's true that some people

816
00:34:09,639 --> 00:34:10,880
never did plastic surgeries.

817
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:12,050
But they do makeup.

818
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:13,159
When she removes her makeup,

819
00:34:13,159 --> 00:34:14,560
you can't recognize her at all.

820
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:16,480
Do you think that counts as natural?

821
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:18,800
But the desire to look attractive is universal.

822
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,239
As long as it's not too much, it's fine.

823
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:23,760
Tell me then.

824
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:25,840
Does my sis need plastic surgery?

825
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:28,120
Bao Xue?

826
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:29,880
She doesn't need it at all.

827
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:30,679
When you look at

828
00:34:30,679 --> 00:34:32,120
her facial features separately,

829
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:33,239
they're all normal.

830
00:34:33,239 --> 00:34:34,639
But when you assemble them,

831
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:36,000
they match each other well.

832
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:37,040
Yeah.

833
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:38,960
When you look at her being so happy,

834
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:40,280
you feel close to her.

835
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:41,719
In my opinion,

836
00:34:42,199 --> 00:34:43,040
she doesn't need it.

837
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:44,199
It's just right.

838
00:34:44,989 --> 00:34:46,920
Even if she does just a bit, it would be much.

839
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:49,159
You are good at chatting.

840
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:51,199
What about me?

841
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:52,920
You?

842
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:56,320
You're not just right.

843
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:59,760
Am I not even as good as my sis?

844
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:03,760
You are perfect.

845
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,360
Do all photographers like you

846
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:09,120
flatter actresses in the same way?

847
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:10,280
Trust me, no.

848
00:35:10,730 --> 00:35:12,720
None of the actresses I cooperated with

849
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:14,080
is as good-looking as you.

850
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:15,920
It's real. I'm not lying to you.

851
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:17,880
Then I can smuggle a bit.

852
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:19,760
I agree.

853
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:29,760
Am I that kind of girl

854
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:31,680
who looks perfect

855
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:33,240
in all angles?

856
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:36,240
You're not like that.

857
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:38,440
I think

858
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:41,200
your left face is less pretty than your right one.

859
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:45,760
What's wrong?

860
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,640
I just complimented your chatting skills.

861
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:49,040
Did you waste the wine?

862
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:53,720
I'll drink this as an apology.

863
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:54,920
I agree.

864
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:08,200
What will you do later on?

865
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:09,680
Later on?

866
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:11,560
Are you not going home?

867
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:12,800
Shall we

868
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:14,280
do the countdown together?

869
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:15,840
I'm not going to nightclubs.

870
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,150
I'm not talking about nightclubs.

871
00:36:17,150 --> 00:36:17,880
Let's watch a movie.

872
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:19,920
Sure.

873
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:21,720
I'm waiting.

874
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:23,200
Sure. Cheers.

875
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:27,160
That's more like it.

876
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:28,040
Good.

877
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:32,920
You can really drink.

878
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:34,600
I inherited it from my family.

879
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:35,400
A cousin of mine

880
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:36,760
has even higher alcohol tolerance.

881
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:38,600
Have you ever been drunk?

882
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:39,800
I almost never was.

883
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:41,360
OK, that's about it.

884
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:43,120
If you get drunk, you'll feel uncomfortable

885
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:44,240
and bring trouble to others.

886
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:44,920
Am I right?

887
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:47,800
You're a pearl among women.

888
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:50,560
You're too kind.

889
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:52,440
You speak too highly of me as a friend.

890
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:56,560
How should I call you?

891
00:36:58,120 --> 00:36:59,560
How should I call you?

892
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:00,920
Don't ask.

893
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:01,680
If you know too much,

894
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:02,920
it will trouble you.

895
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:04,680
You're really interesting.

896
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:06,000
If you get drunk,

897
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,520
I won't even know who you are.

898
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:09,980
We don't know who will get drunk.

899
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:11,120
Don't worry about me. Rest assured.

900
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:12,080
All things can go wrong.

901
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:13,360
Cheers. Bottoms up.

902
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:14,360
Come on.

903
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:15,060
Don't shrink back.

904
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:15,800
Don't drag your feet.

905
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:16,440
Cheers. Bottoms up.

906
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:17,960
Cheers. Bottoms up.

907
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:23,680
You're good.

908
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:26,440
Boss.

909
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:28,280
Two more bottles of Little Lang Liquor.

910
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:48,640
Hello.

911
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:49,840
Hello.

912
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:51,000
What are you doing?

913
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:52,170
I...

914
00:37:52,170 --> 00:37:53,880
just came back from the supermarket.

915
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:55,080
Yesterday, didn't you tell me

916
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:56,920
the food there doesn't agree with you?

917
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:57,720
Yeah.

918
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:00,200
It's either sausages or beer.

919
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:02,440
Look.

920
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:04,240
What's this?

921
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:05,480
I'm making a tutorial.

922
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:07,120
Turn on the screen recording.

923
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:08,600
I'll teach you step by step.

924
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:10,440
Then you'll be able to cook for yourself.

925
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,160
That's so much trouble.

926
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:13,720
Just record the video

927
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:15,120
and send it to me.

928
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:17,800
But we can't communicate if I just make videos.

929
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:20,080
Why do you need communication for mere cooking?

930
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:23,880
It's New Year's Eve today.

931
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:25,920
Just think of it as spending time with me.

932
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:27,400
You left all of a sudden.

933
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:28,200
It's been so long.

934
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:30,360
How many times have you called me?

935
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:31,650
When I wonder if you eat well

936
00:38:31,650 --> 00:38:32,520
or live well,

937
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:33,760
I have to keep asking you.

938
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:35,560
There you go again.

939
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:37,080
I'm just too busy.

940
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:38,800
Do you think I am here for leisure?

941
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:40,640
I started unpacking the moment I arrived here.

942
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:41,760
It's not like you don't know it.

943
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:42,920
Ever since I was young,

944
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:44,480
when did I have to tidy up the room?

945
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:46,120
Also, think about jet lag.

946
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:47,200
I'm almost tired to death.

947
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:49,120
And then,

948
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:51,160
I had to start working almost immediately in the lab.

949
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:52,760
When I arrive home,

950
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:54,920
I don't even have the strength to take off my clothes.

951
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:57,040
Finally, I have a day off today.

952
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:58,280
Then what do you do?

953
00:38:58,280 --> 00:38:59,640
Not only do you want to teach me to cook,

954
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:01,280
but you also ask me to communicate with you.

955
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,880
Can you be a bit considerate?

956
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:06,760
I am considerate.

957
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:08,600
I was just trying to be nice.

958
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:10,160
I appreciate that.

959
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:14,080
If you really want to be nice,

960
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:15,410
just let me have some time off.

961
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:17,800
I have to attend a New Year's Eve banquet

962
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:18,920
in the school in the evening.

963
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:22,240
Alright.

964
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:23,500
You should've told me earlier.

965
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:24,400
I have

966
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:25,960
prepared everything.

967
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:27,880
Alright, babe.

968
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,440
Leave them for yourself.

969
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:32,560
I'm begging you.

970
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:33,760
Let me catch up on lost sleep.

971
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,600
I wish you a happy New Year in advance.

972
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:39,040
OK.

973
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:40,240
Happy New Year.

974
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:42,840
Happy New Year.

975
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:18,680
[Shanshan]

976
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:14,640
Hello,

977
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:16,800
the number you have dialed is powered off.

978
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:17,680
Sorry,

979
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:18,480
the phone...

980
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:41,040
Here.

981
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:41,800
Let me show you

982
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:43,320
a new skill today.

983
00:40:44,430 --> 00:40:45,520
The double stroke roll.

984
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:47,720
As the name suggests,

985
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:49,360
strike it

986
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:50,240
twice per hand

987
00:40:50,540 --> 00:40:51,720
with both hands every time.

988
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:55,720
Take it slow.

989
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:03,920
Hei.

990
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:05,720
Hei.

991
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:07,440
Come in.

992
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:09,120
Shanshan.

993
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:09,840
Youyou.

994
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:10,360
Hi, Youyou.

995
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:11,320
Happy New Year.

996
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:12,600
This is for Hei.

997
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:13,500
That's so nice of you.

998
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:14,660
Happy New Year, Shanshan.

999
00:41:14,660 --> 00:41:15,240
Hei.

1000
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:16,080
Happy New Year.

1001
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:16,920
Happy every year.

1002
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:17,280
Hi, Hei.

1003
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:17,840
Lao.

1004
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:19,000
Come on.

1005
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:19,880
Get inside.

1006
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:21,200
It must be very cold outside.

1007
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:21,880
It's alright.

1008
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:23,240
Come here.

1009
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:24,480
Let's

1010
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:25,480
have some drinks.

1011
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:26,280
Have you

1012
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:27,360
fixed my drum?

1013
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:30,080
I fixed it for you just before the new year.

1014
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:31,600
Try it.

1015
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:32,320
OK.

1016
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:34,800
There's some alcohol on the small cabinet.

1017
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:36,000
Help yourself.

1018
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:37,320
Try it.

1019
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:39,600
Get us some food, Shanshan.

1020
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:44,280
Its youth is back.

1021
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:03,240
Come on.

1022
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:04,520
Here.

1023
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:36,560
Thanks.

1024
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:56,320
Cheers.

1025
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:57,080
Happy New Year.

1026
00:42:57,080 --> 00:42:57,920
Happy New Year.

1027
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:00,120
Happy New Year.

1028
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:01,200
Hei.

1029
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:02,680
Don't always stay indoors.

1030
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:03,920
Play with us again.

1031
00:43:04,330 --> 00:43:06,000
It's better if I don't do performances.

1032
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,520
I'm comfortable here.

1033
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:08,160
Shanshan.

1034
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:09,240
Persuade him.

1035
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:11,520
It's so much fun performing with us.

1036
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:13,040
I won't do that.

1037
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:15,080
Let him do whatever he likes.

1038
00:46:47,960 --> 00:46:48,840
Here.

1039
00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:50,000
It's my New Year gift

1040
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,800
for the next year.

1041
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:57,320
It's the fifth year

1042
00:46:57,320 --> 00:46:58,720
since we've been together.

1043
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:00,280
Time

1044
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:01,480
flies.

1045
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:09,200
Let's make the party tonight cooler.

1046
00:47:14,360 --> 00:47:15,920
Give me some noise.

1047
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:19,720
Be more excited.

1048
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:24,480
Raise all your hands up.

1049
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:42,120
Let's dance.

1050
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:44,560
Dance.

1051
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:45,240
I can't dance.

1052
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:46,320
I can't.

1053
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:48,320
It's okay. I can't either.

1054
00:47:48,320 --> 00:47:50,320
No one knows us, anyways.

1055
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:51,440
Let's go.

1056
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:54,520
Scream.

1057
00:48:13,840 --> 00:48:15,080
Listen to me,

1058
00:48:15,080 --> 00:48:16,640
everybody.

1059
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:18,320
The New Year is almost here.

1060
00:48:18,320 --> 00:48:20,080
Everybody, get prepared.

1061
00:48:20,080 --> 00:48:21,320
Let us hear you.

1062
00:48:21,320 --> 00:48:22,840
Let's do the countdown together.

1063
00:48:22,840 --> 00:48:23,480
Come one.

1064
00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:24,840
Ten.

1065
00:48:24,840 --> 00:48:26,200
Nine.

1066
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:27,560
Eight.

1067
00:48:27,560 --> 00:48:28,840
Seven.

1068
00:48:28,840 --> 00:48:30,200
Six.

1069
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:31,480
Five.

1070
00:48:31,480 --> 00:48:32,680
Four.

1071
00:48:32,680 --> 00:48:33,840
Three.

1072
00:48:33,840 --> 00:48:35,040
Two.

1073
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:35,800
One.

1074
00:48:35,800 --> 00:48:38,200
Happy New Year.

1075
00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:38,920
At this moment,

1076
00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:40,000
Open your arms wide

1077
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,680
and hug the person next to you.

1078
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:46,520
Happy New Year.

1079
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:56,400
Thank you for today.

1080
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:58,000
Happy New Year.
