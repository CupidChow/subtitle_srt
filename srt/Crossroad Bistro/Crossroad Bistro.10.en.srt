4
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:09,400
Hi, Sun.

5
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,039
These tablewares are brand new.

6
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:12,040
Clean them carefully.

7
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:12,720
OK, Ms. Feng.

8
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:13,600
Rest assured.

9
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,640
We're officially open for business tomorrow.

10
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,360
If you have any problems, tell me now.

11
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,640
It's all good.

12
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:28,920
Are there any other ingredients and materials 
 you need?

13
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:29,720
Yes.

14
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,320
Then it's all fine with me.

15
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,800
I'll say a few words.

16
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,640
Pull yourselves together for tomorrow, everyone.

17
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:39,840
After all, it will be the first time we 
 present ourselves as a team.

18
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,000
We have to make sure nothing wrong

19
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
happens in all processes.

20
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:42,880
Do you understand?

21
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:43,760
- Understood. 
 -Sure.

22
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,120
You're dismissed.

23
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:47,160
Are the ingredients enough?

24
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:48,079
Yes.

25
00:02:48,079 --> 00:02:48,530
I told you,

26
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:49,520
trust me with the kitchen.

27
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,480
Don't worry.

28
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:51,840
Feng Xi,

29
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:52,920
you still have to confirm

30
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:54,040
how many customers and dishes

31
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,190
we have to prepare for tomorrow.

32
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:55,960
I need to know these.

33
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,040
Tonight,

34
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,720
I need to prepare the food in advance.

35
00:02:58,720 --> 00:02:59,440
OK.

36
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:00,520
I'll leave you to it.

37
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,440
Alright.

38
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,760
Stir fry both sides

39
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,480
of the chicken wings until golden brown.

40
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:08,520
OK.

41
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,640
Then add light soy sauce,

42
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:11,720
dark soy sauce,

43
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:12,760
ginger, chives,

44
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:13,680
MSG

45
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,160
and a bit of salt.

46
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,320
Then add come coke

47
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:18,079
until it fully covers the chicken wings.

48
00:03:18,079 --> 00:03:19,440
Boil it with high heat

49
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,360
and simmer to make the sauce thicker.

50
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,400
Now repeat the recipe.

51
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,560
Ms. Bai,

52
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,560
why is this dish so complicated?

53
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,120
It's not complicated.

54
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:28,720
Recite it to me.

55
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:29,400
Grandma.

56
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,400
I'm back.

57
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:32,200
Welcome back, Xue.

58
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:33,480
Who is this?

59
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,079
This is Doctor Lv.

60
00:03:35,079 --> 00:03:37,040
This is my granddaughter, Xue.

61
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:39,760
Nice to meet you, Doctor Lv.

62
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:40,800
Hello, Xue.

63
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:42,800
Ms. Bai,

64
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,360
both your granddaughters

65
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,320
are so pretty.

66
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,680
Thank you for the compliment, Doctor Lv.

67
00:03:55,079 --> 00:03:57,000
What's the gossip?

68
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:59,560
He is courting grandma.

69
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,040
On New Year's Day,

70
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,560
I went here to keep grandma company.

71
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,560
When I entered the flat,

72
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,520
I saw the two of them cooking together.

73
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,480
I immediately felt I was redundant

74
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:10,560
and went away quickly.

75
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,320
Then grandma called me.

76
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,960
She said on New Year's eve,

77
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,320
Doctor Lv kept her company.

78
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:16,959
A few days ago,

79
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:19,040
the two of them went on a trip to a mountain.

80
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,360
Oh my gosh.

81
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,880
When did they start to like each other?

82
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,080
What do I know?

83
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,440
Grandma.

84
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:32,159
Are you staying this time?

85
00:04:32,159 --> 00:04:34,120
I'm going to Hengdian World Studios next week.

86
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,840
You need to get some rest.

87
00:04:38,159 --> 00:04:40,400
I thought you'd be back after New Year.

88
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,680
Then you went to Shanxi Province.

89
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,600
Do you think I don't want to come back?

90
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,430
But they wanted me

91
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:45,920
for that drama so much.

92
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:48,270
The producer said it.

93
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:49,010
If I wasn't in it,

94
00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:49,980
the director would quit

95
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:52,020
and the TV station wouldn't broadcast that drama.

96
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:52,400
Just tell me,

97
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,960
am I important?

98
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,280
You're too important.

99
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:57,320
Nonsense.

100
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,680
Be more serious.

101
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:00,360
Grandma.

102
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:02,240
Let me ask you something serious.

103
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:02,920
Sure.

104
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,600
Is that senior gentleman

105
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:07,120
courting you?

106
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,400
Where do you get that idea from?

107
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:12,160
I saw it from the way he looked at you.

108
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,000
We are old

109
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,080
and the color of our pupils becomes grey.

110
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,110
How can you tell anything from the look he gave me?

111
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:19,720
Just tell me if I'm right.

112
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,640
If so, then what?

113
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:22,760
If not, then what?

114
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:23,800
Sis,

115
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,360
grandma admitted it.

116
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,960
You are such a gossip.

117
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,480
My dear old lady,

118
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:34,880
you are pushing me so hard.

119
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:37,280
I'm 25 years old and I'm single.

120
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,200
You're over 70 years old.

121
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,470
Still, you have a suitor who follows you around the world.

122
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:42,320
When I see the smile of happiness on your faces,

123
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,560
I think about Shameful, the title track

124
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:47,120
of the band Black Panther.

125
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:50,560
Enough of these titles.

126
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,840
It's just he and I are both old.

127
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,000
We keep each other company.

128
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:54,760
Sis.

129
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:56,320
Did you hear her?

130
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:58,159
She talks about love in old age

131
00:05:58,159 --> 00:06:00,360
with such a plain tone.

132
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,880
I admire you so much, grandma.

133
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,040
Drink the soup.

134
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,520
When you finish, carry on with your work.

135
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:09,360
I don't even know what I'm going to do.

136
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:11,280
My plan

137
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,280
was to go to Huairou for filming.

138
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,320
I went here to check on you.

139
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:16,920
Now I see you're so happy,

140
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:20,000
I can leave in peace.

141
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,570
Don't jinx yourself, girl.

142
00:06:21,570 --> 00:06:22,960
Are you joining a filming crew?

143
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:23,320
Yeah.

144
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:25,060
The restaurant is open for business tomorrow.

145
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:26,200
I do remember it.

146
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,720
I'll leave for one day only.

147
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,160
Wait.

148
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,160
To be exact, it's just one night.

149
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:30,840
I won't be absent.

150
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:32,500
Isn't it stupid to not earn money when I can?

151
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:32,880
Right?

152
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,120
You are so money-hungry.

153
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,920
Congratulations, you get it right.

154
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,440
I am determined to earn money

155
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:39,880
and replace my shabby car which squeaks

156
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:41,840
when touched anywhere but the horn button.

157
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,320
But don't work too hard.

158
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:44,720
If you wear yourself out,

159
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,440
the money you earn

160
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:47,970
won't be enough for the treatment.

161
00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:48,960
Don't worry about that.

162
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,040
I can handle everything.

163
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,200
Grandma,

164
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,080
come to the opening tomorrow

165
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,840
and bring Doctor Lv with you.

166
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,400
I've been trying to persuade her for a while.

167
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,840
She just won't go.

168
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:00,240
Why?

169
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,960
It's your business.

170
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,040
If we want to visit,

171
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,720
we can go there any day.

172
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,760
Why would we try to squeeze in tomorrow?

173
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:09,240
Take good care of the customers tomorrow.

174
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,920
We won't make it harder for you.

175
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:12,840
True.

176
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,560
It makes sense.

Then don't come, grandma.

Yeah.

Aren't you concerned about electricity bills?

196
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,720
I just want to turn them on and check

197

if any is broken.

198
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,000
I'll turn them off soon.

adjusting the menu,

202
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:11,960
keeping an eye on the kitchen,

203
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:13,600
making banners, picking up flowers,

204
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,160
and arranging for tomorrow's photos

205

and videos.

206
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:19,840
I also sent invitations to those working in business, 
 taxes and fire and rescue.

on everything.

211

It's indeed difficult to be a boss.

212

I heard Ms. You said

213
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,799
she will give you three days off

219

and launch it on three delivery apps.

The Greman brand Wurenbacher is doing a promotion

221
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:52,440
on imported beer at our place.

222
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,560
They even sent the clothes here.

223
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,440
These are too much for my brain.

224
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,920
Don't they take care of the business?

225
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:01,160
Since the beginning, Yu and Xue made it clear

226
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,040
that they won't run it.

227
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:02,560

00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:03,720
I don't have much to do anyway,

229
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,200
so I offered to take over.

230

Who would've known that I was looking for trouble?

00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,800
Come here whenever you want.

348
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:11,000
Good.

349
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,400
Will you charge us, Ms. You?

350
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:13,600
If you buy a membership card today,

351
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,190
everything will be free from now on.

352
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,280
Alright. I'll do it.

353
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:19,160
Let's do it.

354
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,360
On the count of three.

355
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:22,560
One,

356
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:23,200
two,

357
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,000
three.

358
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:26,280
♫We are♫

359
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:29,780
♫Who we are♫

360
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:34,100
♫We're there for each other in laughter and tears♫

361
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:37,030
♫We are by each other's side♫

362
00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:39,180
♫We have agreed♫

363
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:40,580
♫That we will stay together♫

364
00:13:40,830 --> 00:13:44,980
♫And fight till the end of time♫

365
00:13:45,610 --> 00:13:47,790
♫Little did we know that in front of life♫

366
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:51,040
♫We♫

367
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:52,080
[Crossroad Bistro]

368
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:56,650
♫We don't stand a chance♫

369
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:54,760
Come here.

370
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:55,800
Show me your forehead.

371
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,200
That won't work.

372
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,440
You have to rub it with your palm.

373
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,200
Rub it?

374
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:06,880
Here it goes.

375
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:07,800
-Hold still. 
-Be gentle.

376
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,040
It hurts.

377
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:12,960
Have you finished?

378
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,040
I can feel your pain.

379
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,600
Dear me.

380
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:18,360
You'll heal faster.

381
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:20,160
Sis, I've always been in other cities.

382
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:20,960
I haven't visited it

383
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,440
after the decoration is done.

384
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,440
The decoration is quite...

385
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:25,240
How is it?

386
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,160
Nice, right?

387
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:31,000
It's alright. Not bad.

388
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,160
A bit better than nothing at all.

389
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,680
Just a bit.

390
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,760
You really damaged your brain.

391
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,280
You can't even tell good from bad.

392
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:41,720
I met a despicable guy and had a car crash recently.

393
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:42,880
Should I set off firecrackers

394
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,310
to get rid of the bad luck?

395
00:14:44,310 --> 00:14:45,760
But firecrackers are not allowed.

396
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:46,480
It's alright.

397
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,120
You can set it with yourself anyways.

398
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,200
The shareholder of Crossroad Bistro

399
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,440
bumped her head just like a firecracker.

400
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:54,480
Why do you have to make jokes like that?

401
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:55,840
Will it kill you to be nice to me?

402
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:57,560
It's the opening today.

403
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:58,320
Don't you mention that word!

404
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,240
It's bad luck.

405
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:02,320
It's all your fault.

406
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,360
You made me say it.

407
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,160
You're just

408
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:05,320
such a pain.

409
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,280
Yu Songyang.

410
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,400
I'll leave her to you.

411
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:08,920
I'll join Ms. Chai.

412
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:10,280
Alright. Off you go.

413
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:11,640
Wait.

414
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:13,760
Do you really trust me with him?

415
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,240
What if something bad happens to me?

416
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,560
What would you do?

417
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:17,960
If something happens to you,

418
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:18,960
I will take care of you.

419
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:19,920
Don't push your luck.

420
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:20,600
We agreed.

421
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:21,480
We can chat

422
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:22,880
but nothing more will happen.

423
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,680
You finally found someone at your level.

424
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:26,040
Have a nice chat,

425
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:26,800
the two of you.

426
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:27,880
Damn it.

427
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:28,560
Sis,

428
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:30,520
why can't I see Liu?

429
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:31,600
Didn't you invite him?

430
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,480
I did.

431
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:33,960
But he is filming in northeast China.

432
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:34,640
When he comes back,

433
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:36,380
we will celebrate our birthdays together.

434
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:39,600
You've made great progress in your relationship.

435
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,800
What are you talking about?

436
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,240
Stop this nonsense,

437
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,680
He and I are just friends.

438
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:49,000
Are you hungry?

439
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,040
I can get you something to eat.

440
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:50,680
There's no need.

441
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:53,640
I shall take a look at the prosperity of my dynasty.

442
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,280
Enjoy it.

443
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:00,760
Welcome.

444
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:02,520
Hello, we're Ms. You's friends.

445
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:03,720
OK. Welcome.

446
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:04,800
Get inside.

447
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,520
It's troublesome to bring a kid around.

448
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:07,480
We tried our best

449
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:09,260
but didn't see the ceremony of cutting the ribbon.

450
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:09,960
It's alright.

451
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:10,640
This way, please.

452
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,240
The decoration is so nice.

453
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:14,240
Thank you.

454
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,040
This way, please.

455
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:16,800
Come on. Let's follow her.

456
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:26,280
Chef.

457
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:27,880
Almost all the cold dishes are served.

458
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:28,720
OK.

459
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:29,680
Let do the hot dishes.

460
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:30,800
Alright.

461
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:34,890
My dear gourmet bloggers,

462
00:16:34,890 --> 00:16:36,200
advertise the restaurant for me.

463
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:38,200
We count on you to make it an internet-famous restaurant.

464
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,120
No problem. Trust us with it.

465
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,320
The second table in the middle.

466
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,360
I'll have a drink with you.

467
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,040
Take a seat first.

468
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,640
Shanshan.

469
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:46,880
Thank you.

470
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,400
Congratulations.

471
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:49,240
Thanks.

472
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,520
Let me introduce him to you.

473
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:51,760
This is my husband, Du Shijun.

474
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:52,720
Hello.

475
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:53,960
I'll make an introduction too.

476
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,000
This is Feng Xi, the manager.

477
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,200
She is also a shareholder.

478
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:57,560
Yeah.

479
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:58,320
Talk to her

480
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,220
if you want to dine here.

481
00:16:59,220 --> 00:16:59,640
OK.

482
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:00,840
Welcome.

483
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:01,210
Thank you.

484
00:17:01,210 --> 00:17:02,440
Let's add each other's contact later on.

485
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:02,800
Alright.

486
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:03,600
Have fun chatting.

487
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:04,760
I'll go and work outside.

488
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:06,319
Ms. You,

489
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:07,359
we've met each other before.

490
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:09,319
When was it?

491
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:11,160
It was last summer

492
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,480
at Liangma Restaurant.

493
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:14,880
Were you having dinner with Mr. Ge?

494
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,920
I saw you when I toasted Mr. Ge.

495
00:17:20,359 --> 00:17:21,240
It's alright. Don't worry.

496
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,319
You forgot.

497
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:23,359
We'll know each other after today.

498
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:24,640
I'm so sorry.

499
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:25,880
Ge is here too.

500
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:26,359
Really?

501
00:17:26,359 --> 00:17:26,960
Just over there.

502
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:27,920
Then I'll greet him later on.

503
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:28,440
OK.

504
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:29,560
I'll find a table for you first.

505
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:30,800
Come here, darling.

506
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,780
I have arranged special seats for you.

507
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:33,680
Come here and sit.

508
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:34,880
Wow, designated seat.

509
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:35,800
Ya,

510
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:37,880
get them some nice dishes.

511
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:38,960
Have a seat over here.

512
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:39,400
OK.

513
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:39,920
Thanks.

514
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:41,160
You're all my friends.

515
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,600
Come on, make some self-introduction.

516
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:43,920
I'm Du Shijun.

517
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:47,880
Why are you still standing there?

518
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:50,040
You're behind the schedule.

519
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:53,600
Ge,

520
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,280
Du Shijun is here.

521
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,040
I didn't expect he is the husband of my friend.

522
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:58,320
Isn't it a coincidence?

523
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:59,400
Really?

524
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,120
Later on,

525
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,200
I'll get over there and greet him.

526
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:01,560
Right.

527
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:02,480
Shanshan.

528
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,160
In my opinion,

529
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:05,680
Dai Xiaoyu is fabulous.

530
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,000
Do you get what I mean, Yu?

531
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:09,920
You are very beautiful.

532
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:11,320
However,

533
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:14,360
you don't take your beauty seriously.

534
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:16,840
This makes you completely different

535
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:18,080
from many women around me.

536
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:19,400
You

537
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:21,240
have something really valuable,

538
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:23,080
but you don't think of it as a big deal.

539
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,480
That's so great.

540
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:25,920
I mean it, Dai Xiaoyu.

541
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:28,360
You're so great.

542
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:29,640
Mr. Chai,

543
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:31,800
since you admire me so much,

544
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,880
buy a membership card over here.

545
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:35,640
Yu is right.

546
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:36,720
It's a piece of cake.

547
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,120
I'll do it now.

548
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:39,280
50,000 RMB.

549
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,080
You should do it too.

550
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,240
Support them with action.

551
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:42,240
Alright?

552
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,920
In the future, no matter it's a meeting with clients

553
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:45,680
or friends,

554
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:46,680
I will come here.

555
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:48,160
I will support

556
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,480
Crossroad Bistro

557
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:51,080
with action.

558
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:51,640
Let's drink.

559
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:51,960
Cheers.

560
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:52,640
Cheers.

561
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:53,600
Cheers.

562
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:56,200
We wish

563
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:57,520
Shanshan

564
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:58,560
and Dai Xiaoyu

565
00:18:58,560 --> 00:18:59,560
have a prosperous business

566
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:00,380
and earn a lot of money.

567
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:01,880
Thank you.

568
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:05,920
Have fun.

569
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,400
I'll introduce Yu to a friend.

570
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:08,320
OK.

571
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:10,120
Come back later on.

572
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:15,080
Yu,

573
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:18,920
we are partners

574
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:20,040
and friends.

575
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:21,960
I have to remind you a bit.

576
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:23,680
Chai is not bad

577
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:25,640
in terms of personality.

578
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:27,800
However, he will never change

579
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:28,640
his lust

580
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:29,560
for women.

581
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,320
He married four wives and divorced all of them.

582
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,800
I understand. I know where to stop.

583
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:36,400
It's not about where to stop.

584
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,200
I'm afraid it won't be under your control.

585
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:40,800
Find a chance

586
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,400
and get away from him.

587
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:43,440
You're so clever.

588
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:44,680
There's nothing you can't do.

589
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:45,960
Also, I can help you.

590
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:47,800
Thank you, Shan.

591
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,200
I'll think about it.

592
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:50,560
Let's not

593
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:51,520
talk about this today.

594
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:52,840
We have so many friends to attend to.

595
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:53,560
Alright.

596
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:54,680
When you have time after this,

597
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:55,610
have a proper chat with me.

598
00:19:55,610 --> 00:19:55,960
Alright.

599
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:56,800
Come on.

600
00:19:59,120 --> 00:19:59,840
Everyone.

601
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:00,800
Si Meng,

602
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,320
I'll introduce a friend to you.

603
00:20:03,330 --> 00:20:04,800
This is Si Meng and this is Du Shijun.

604
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:05,600
They are a couple.

605
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:06,920
This is Dai Xiaoyu, my shareholder.

606
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:07,760
Hello.

607
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:08,960
Welcome.

608
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,040
Enjoy the meal.

609
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:12,160
It feels like your wedding.

610
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:13,280
A newly married couple.

611
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:14,400
There you are.

612
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,080
Good, you're here.

613
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,640
Let me introduce you.

614
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:18,720
This is Bao Xue.

615
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:19,480
They are sisters.

616
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:20,320
She is an actress.

617
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,050
Nice to meet you.

618
00:20:21,050 --> 00:20:22,520
This is Si Meng and this is Du Shijun.

619
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:23,360
They are a couple.

620
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:24,640
I'm just a nameless actress.

621
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:28,600
Mr. Du.

622
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:30,640
We've met before, do you remember?

623
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,040
Were all of us present at that time?

624
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:33,640
You're right.

625
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:34,760
We had a meal together.

626
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:36,360
Were you there too?

627
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:36,760
Yes.

628
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:38,200
That day, I toasted Mr. Ge.

629
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:40,630
Your memories are so accurate.

630
00:20:40,630 --> 00:20:41,920
It's easy to remember him.

631
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:44,320
You've had many meals with pretty girls behind my back.

632
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:45,200
It's not like that.

633
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,280
That was just a coincidence.

634
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:47,680
Come on.

635
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:49,000
Let me introduce another guy to you.

636
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:50,560
This is Yu Songyang,

637
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:52,120
the designer of this restaurant.

638
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,120
The design looks so nice.

639
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:55,840
I was just telling him.

640
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,760
It's exactly what I like.

641
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:58,840
You've got such great taste.

642
00:20:58,840 --> 00:20:59,920
Thank you.

643
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:01,600
Let's add WeChat contacts later on

644
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:02,370
and join a group chat.

645
00:21:02,370 --> 00:21:04,160
If you want to eat anything, it'll be convenient.

646
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:05,440
Just tell me in the group chat.

647
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:06,960
Thanks. That's so nice.

648
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,880
Then I will organize all the meetings

649
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:09,960
in my firm over here.

650
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:12,800
Then you will have the same discount as Si Meng.

651
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:13,640
Big discount.

652
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:14,560
Alright.

653
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:17,040
I'll take them to a couple of friends.

654
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:17,840
OK.

655
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:18,640
Remember the group chat.

656
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:19,720
Talk to you later.

657
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:23,560
Come here.

658
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:27,280
All shareholders are over here.

659
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:34,560
OK.

660
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:35,240
It's alright.

661
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:36,520
You have the address now.

662
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:38,480
Come any time if you want to eat something.

663
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:41,160
It turns out Safflower Oil is really useful.

664
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:41,800
Yes, I have it.

665
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:42,800
I received your flowers.

666
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:43,800
Thank you.

667
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,520
Comrades,

668
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:47,560
should we also celebrate?

669
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:49,040
That's for sure.

670
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:50,200
Here, Feng Xi.

671
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:51,640
Yes?

672
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:53,040
Here's to you.

673
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:53,880
Why?

674
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:57,960
The three of us

675
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:59,360
have different things to do.

676
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,920
We can't stay here all day long.

677
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,720
The future of this place counts on you.

678
00:22:03,050 --> 00:22:03,840
In the past few days,

679
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,160
you've been so busy with the opening.

680
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:06,000
I know you worked hard.

681
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,360
I saw it all.

682
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,600
I'm giving you three days off.

683
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:09,400
Get some good rest.

684
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:10,920
There's no need.

685
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:12,320
Get some rest.

686
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,000
Feng Xi,

687
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:17,440
Shan is totally right about it.

688
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:19,520
Today, I see

689
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,600
your working mode for the first time.

690
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,200
You are so devoted

691
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,280
and tend to everything.

692
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:26,300
I admire you from the bottom of my heart.

693
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:27,560
Here's to you.

694
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:28,800
Come on, don't say it like that.

695
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:29,720
I mean it.

696
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:30,240
Here's to you.

697
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:31,560
Feng Xi, thank you for your hard work.

698
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:32,200
Here's to Feng Xi.

699
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,440
Thank you.

700
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:34,840
Cheers. A toast from me too.

701
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:40,840
When you said I tend to everything,

702
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,760
did you mean every detail?

703
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:03,720
Morning, Sun.

704
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:04,520
Ms. Feng.

705
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:05,440
You're here early.

706
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:06,920
Thanks for your work.

707
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:08,120
You're welcome.

708
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:11,680
What's wrong?

709
00:23:13,310 --> 00:23:14,680
When Fan arrived here today,

710
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:16,620
he found out the cooking smell is still in the kitchen.

711
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:17,320
So we're checking.

712
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,800
Didn't you realize it yesterday?

713
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:22,920
We didn't notice when we were cooking.

714
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:25,000
The clogging shouldn't be serious.

715
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Otherwise,

716
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,680
no one can stand staying in the kitchen.

717
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:31,000
Look.

718
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:32,880
That's it.

719
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:39,560
Who was in charge when they

720
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:40,740
changed the facilities?

721
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:42,800
Me.

722
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,200
Did you fall with him

723
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,320
because of this?

724
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:54,840
Yeah.

725
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,560
You just told me

726
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:59,000
after you split up,

727
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,240
He gave you some money.

728
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:02,000
Did you take it?

729
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:03,600
Yes.

730
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:10,400
What's the problem?

731
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,040
Do you think I shouldn't have taken it?

732
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:14,360
It's your choice.

733
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:15,760
You shouldn't be blamed for taking it.

734
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:16,640
But if it were me,

735
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,200
I definitely wouldn't have taken it.

736
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,200
But that would be a bigger loss.

737
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,720
My five years of youth...

738
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:22,600
Stop it now.

739
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:24,000
I can't stand these words.

740
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:25,840
Feng Xi is just like you.

741
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:28,200
Every time I say I don't think she and Li Xiang 
 will have a future,

742
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,240
she goes like

743
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,760
"but it has been for ten years since I was young".

744
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:33,360
Whether it's five

745
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:34,320
or ten years,

746
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:36,080
that's your own choice.

747
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:37,400
Did anyone

748
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:38,160
point a gun at your head

749
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:39,400
and force you to stay with him?

750
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:42,960
Let me tell you.

751
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:43,720
It is five years

752
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:44,600
in your life.

753
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:46,080
But it's also five years in his life.

754
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:48,280
Time is the fairest to the two of you.

755
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:49,720
Fair?

756
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,120
I don't think fairness exists in the world.

757
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,160
I paid all the expenses

758
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:55,880
for his treatment

759
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:57,080
and nutrition.

760
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:59,040
I have every reason to take that money.

761
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:00,320
What would you do if it were you?

762
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:01,650
Would you turn around and leave?

763
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:06,200
Are you trying to quarrel with me?

764
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:10,280
Maybe we have different personalities.

765
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:13,680
When I

766
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:14,800
got the divorce,

767
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:16,080
I didn't have any money with me.

768
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:17,480
He said he would give me some,

769
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:18,600
but I simply refused that.

770
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,200
Do you know why?

771
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:21,760
Because I think

772
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:23,800
if I took his money,

773
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:25,320
we would be even.

774
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:26,720
Then he will feel

775
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,600
that he has compensated me with money.

776
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:33,480
We're no longer young

777
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:35,000
and we can't go back.

778
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,120
Everyone knows

779
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:37,480
how it works.

780
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,480
But my opinion is

781
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,120
we can't just put a price tag

782
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:45,440
on our youth and ask for money, right?

783
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:47,640
When you take his money,

784
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:48,680
it means

785
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:50,560
he pays for your youth.

786
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:52,600
Then his conscience is clear.

787
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,360
I know him too well.

788
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,480
He wouldn't be easy on himself.

789
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,080
You still hate him, right?

790
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:08,960
Yes.

791
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:10,840
Then you still haven't let it go.

792
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,240
What should I tell you, then?

793
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:14,480
That I don't hate him?

794
00:26:14,930 --> 00:26:16,520
I just forget about everything

795
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:17,560
that happened in the past

796
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:18,760
and become friends with him?

797
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:20,760
I can't manage that.

798
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:23,960
You've been back for so long.

799
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:24,840
Has he ever contacted you?

800
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:26,800
He's been trying to.

801
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:30,120
In my opinion,

802
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:32,280
better a little loss than a long sorrow.

803
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:34,240
You'd better make it clear

804
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:35,440
and put an end to it.

805
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:36,880
Don't waste time.

806
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,360
It has already ended.

807
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:40,000
It's impossible for us to be together anymore.

808
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,240
That's not an ending.

809
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:42,680
You've been running away from it.

810
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:45,000
Do you think

811
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,480
when someone disappears from a relationship,

812
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:48,200
the other person

813
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:50,000
will get used to it as time goes by?

814
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,400
It's impossible.

815
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:53,000
Unless you die.

816
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:55,880
Otherwise,

817
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,360
the two of you will continue to be like this,

818
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:58,800
just like cats chasing rats.

819
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:04,400
The will

820
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,560
is a solid proof

821
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:06,880
that he doesn't care about you

822
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:09,040
at all.

823
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:11,000
I don't understand why you are still hesitating.

824
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:15,320
Can you listen to me?

825
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:18,200
Your life is precious.

826
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,040
It's unworthy to waste

827
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:21,760
one more minute of your life on him.

828
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:26,440
You're right.

829
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:27,440
So?

830
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:29,400
I have to end it.

831
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:31,360
That's how you start

832
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:32,600
a new life

833
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:34,120
and completely let go of the past.

834
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:39,440
I used to worry every day

835
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:41,280
if he would contact me

836
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:42,840
or call me all of a sudden.

837
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:45,000
After chatting with you,

838
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:46,440
I suddenly

839
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:47,800
have an insight into the problem.

840
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:49,640
Thank you.

841
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:51,320
Don't thank me.

842
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:54,160
I just can't stand seeing people around me feel wronged.

843
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:57,680
I want to offer all of you solid support.

844
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:06,040
What type of tea do you want?

845
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:08,080
Aged white tea will do.

846
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:10,080
It's good for old people like me.

847
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:10,880
Xue.

848
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,040
I'll order it for you later.

849
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:13,200
Xue.

850
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:15,560
Coming.

851
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:16,480
Come here.

852
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:17,840
Let me introduce her to you.

853
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:19,200
This

854
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,120
is my grandma.

855
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:21,040
Also my cousin's grandma.

856
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:22,800
How should I address you?

857
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:23,680
It doesn't matter.

858
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:24,760
Hello, my dear grandma.

859
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:27,840
That's it.

860
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:29,600
This is Doctor Lv.

861
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,560
He's a friend of my grandma's.

862
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:33,960
Hello, Doctor Lv.

863
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:34,600
Nice to meet you.

864
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:36,520
Which hospital do you work for?

865
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:38,160
Beijing University Seventh Hospital.

866
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:39,240
That's a big hospital.

867
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:40,120
But I've retired.

868
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:41,600
Here.

869
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,400
Let me seriously introduce her to you.

870
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:44,400
This

871
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:45,840
is the woman I talked about

872
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:47,320
so many times.

873
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:47,680
OK.

874
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:49,000
She's the biggest shareholder here.

875
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,530
She is also the 200th on 
 the top 100 Entrepreneurs' Association

876
00:28:51,530 --> 00:28:52,640
for Businesswomen

877
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:53,640
Her name is You Shanshan.

878
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:55,600
Don't listen to her.

879
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:56,600
She is young and capable.

880
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:57,600
You flatter me.

881
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:59,600
Xue always makes jokes.

882
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:01,120
Did she make it harder for you?

883
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:02,210
Of course not.

884
00:29:02,210 --> 00:29:03,120
If it wasn't for her,

885
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,320
we wouldn't have had so much fun.

886
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:05,280
Listen to her.

887
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:06,280
Ah, right.

888
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:07,560
These are couplets

889
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:09,560
my grandma gifts us.

890
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:15,040
The wine smells nice when the customers arrive.

891
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:16,800
The tea is kept warm when the customers leave.

892
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:18,280
Great couplets and great calligraphy.

893
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,080
It's a present from me

894
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:21,210
and Doctor Lv to celebrate

895
00:29:21,210 --> 00:29:22,160
the opening.

896
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:24,480
We're not sure what young people like

897
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:25,840
and prepared the couplets.

898
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:27,400
Doctor Lv wrote it.

899
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:28,400
For me,

900
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:30,040
it's just a hobby.

901
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:30,560
I'm glad

902
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:31,680
as long as you like it.

903
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:32,720
Of course, we like it.

904
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,240
The couplets match the decoration so well.

905
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:34,880
Yeah.

906
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:35,720
Doctor Lv,

907
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:37,880
let's have a proper drink later on.

908
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:39,160
Thank you a lot.

909
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:40,040
Let's sit down.

910
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:41,080
I have prepared the dishes.

911
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:41,840
I'll tell them to serve.

912
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:42,720
Alright.

913
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,160
Come on. Have a seat.

914
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:44,920
Doctor Lv, here.

915
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:46,280
Doctor Lv, take the seat of the host.

916
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:46,760
No.

917
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:47,800
It's your big day.

918
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:49,000
You should sit over there.

919
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,360
Come on. Have a seat.

920
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:51,190
Sit over here, then.

921
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:56,200
Hello.

922
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:00,800
Did you come back just now?

923
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:01,720
Yeah.

924
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:03,210
I wanted to tell you to bring Yu.

925
00:30:03,210 --> 00:30:05,000
I was planning to take you out for dinner

926
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,430
after returning the equipment together.

927
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:07,560
We won't join.

928
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:09,480
I ate too much tonight.

929
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:11,440
My sis

930
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:13,600
asked me to pay tribute to you.

931
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:14,800
She is meeting clients

932
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:16,200
with her boss in the club.

933
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:19,360
Take this.

934
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:20,520
What's this?

935
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:22,640
It's One Nest of Yan Palace.

936
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:23,640
It's for your grandma.

937
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:24,920
Wait.

938
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:26,960
It's your cousin's grandma.

939
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,280
Never mind, she's your grandma too.

940
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:31,400
You have learned

941
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:33,600
to curry favor with my grandma.

942
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,760
You are devoted to courting my sis.

943
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:37,360
I prepared gifts for the two of you.

944
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:39,520
I was told

945
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:40,680
the nest

946
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:41,960
nourishes the lung

947
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:43,120
and is anti-aging.

948
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:45,080
It's very good for girls.

949
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:46,400
Many girls eat this

950
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:47,320
to be young and healthy.

951
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:49,640
You must've done your research.

952
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:50,760
You're dedicated.

953
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:51,520
Thank you.

954
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:54,520
However,

955
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:55,640
the thing my sis and I

956
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:56,680
need the most

957
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:57,760
is not this.

958
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:59,000
What is it then?

959
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,720
Both of us need love.

960
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:03,200
Well, I have that for you.

961
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,840
Save all of that for my sis.

962
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:05,870
I won't take away your love

963
00:31:05,870 --> 00:31:07,280
which is scarce, to begin with.

964
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:10,840
Did your cousin

965
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:12,160
tell you that we will celebrate

966
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:13,440
our birthdays together?

967
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:14,720
Yes, she did.

968
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:16,450
She said in these few days when you're not here,

969
00:31:16,450 --> 00:31:17,600
you confirmed 50 times with her.

970
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,160
I was just worried

971
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:21,200
that she would forget.

972
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:22,360
Don't worry.

973
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,080
Even if she forgets her name,

974
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:25,320
she won't forget about this.

975
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:25,800
OK.

976
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:26,680
I'm glad then.

977
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:28,480
Alright.

978
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,240
Let me thank you again

979
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:30,920
for my sis,

980
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:31,640
my grandma

981
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:32,600
and myself.

982
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:33,480
Thank you.

983
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:34,720
I'll go, then.

984
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:35,520
OK.

985
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:36,760
OK. Bye-bye.

986
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:37,280
Bye-bye.

987
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:38,600
Tell me when you arrive home.

988
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:53,600
Hello.

989
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:55,920
What are you eating?

990
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:58,560
I'm eating

991
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:00,840
pork jerky from Bestore.

992
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:03,440
I really like this kind of meat recently.

993
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:05,040
It's so tasty.

994
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:08,000
My club is doing an activity.

995
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:09,480
I'm in Jiangxi Province.

996
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:11,080
What kind of activity?

997
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:12,600
Eating barbecue together?

998
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:14,880
Why can't you think about anything other than food?

999
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:17,280
-Rock climbing.
-Rock climbing?

1000
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:19,440
Is it that kind of activity

1001
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:21,480
where you don't have any protections

1002
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:22,200
and are likely to

1003
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:23,680
"game over" any moment?

1004
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:27,200
Why are you doing this?

1005
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:29,440
It's so dangerous.

1006
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:31,000
I've been doing this for years.

1007
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,760
It's not difficult this time.

1008
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:34,480
When will you come back?

1009
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:35,760
In three days.

1010
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:36,440
What's the matter?

1011
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:39,640
Never mind.

1012
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:41,120
I had planned

1013
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:42,160
to invite you to a shared

1014
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:43,120
birthday party

1015
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:44,200
between my sis and the guy

1016
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:45,640
who pursues her.

1017
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:48,480
It seems like you won't have the chance.

1018
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:50,480
Then I'll celebrate it for her again when I'm back.

1019
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:51,320
That will work too.

1020
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:55,200
Do keep yourself safe.

1021
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,880
You care about me a lot.

1022
00:33:00,140 --> 00:33:01,920
Even it's a stranger who does dangerous stuff,

1023
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:03,040
I would tell him to take care.

1024
00:33:03,730 --> 00:33:05,280
Alright. I'll continue with the drama.

1025
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:06,320
That's it. I'll hang up.

1026
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:06,640
Bye-bye.

1027
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:07,960
Good night.

1028
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:27,080
Damn.

1029
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:31,960
I'm doomed.

1030
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:33,960
Damn. Damn.

1031
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:36,080
Oh my god. Damn.

1032
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:36,720
Sis,

1033
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:37,640
damn it.

1034
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:38,920
What's the problem?

1035
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:41,320
I'm going to have a problem.

1036
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:42,720
What kind of problem?

1037
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:44,800
I just invited Yu Songyang

1038
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:45,940
to your birthday party.

1039
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:47,520
He said he's away and has some stuff to do

1040
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:48,360
and that he can't join.

1041
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,440
Then just leave him.

1042
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:52,600
That's not the problem.

1043
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:54,600
All of a sudden, I just felt

1044
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:56,040
I was at a loss.

1045
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:57,000
Do you get what I mean, sis?

1046
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,060
When he said he can't come,

1047
00:33:58,060 --> 00:33:59,840
I felt at a loss all of a sudden.

1048
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:02,640
I was there, eating the pork jerky and it was so tasty.

1049
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:03,400
All of a sudden,

1050
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:04,800
I lost my sense of taste.

1051
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,120
Why are you making waves at midnight?

1052
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:10,360
I thought you lost your virginity.

1053
00:34:11,159 --> 00:34:12,679
If I carry on feeling at lost,

1054
00:34:12,679 --> 00:34:15,840
I'll lose my virginity sooner or later.

1055
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:17,560
Isn't that a piece of good news?

1056
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:18,760
Grandma and your mom

1057
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:20,480
both want you to find a boyfriend.

1058
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:21,960
Make them happy, make them smile.

1059
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:22,920
They might be happy,

1060
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:24,560
but I'm not.

1061
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:27,440
Why are you so dramatic?

1062
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,120
Why are you unhappy about this?

1063
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:30,040
Sis,

1064
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:31,400
do you know what he is doing right now?

1065
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:33,719
Rock climbing.

1066
00:34:33,719 --> 00:34:34,400
I am already

1067
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:36,040
so worried about him right now.

1068
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:38,840
How can I be happy?

1069
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:40,520
But he used to do these when he was abroad.

1070
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:49,199
It's so annoying.

1071
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:50,920
Love flows

1072
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:52,840
as overwhelming as a tornado.

1073
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:00,600
Is there anything wrong with you?

1074
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:03,400
You don't understand the love between artists.

1075
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:19,160
Quiet, please.

1076
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:20,080
This is

1077
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:23,200
the 18th birthday

1078
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:24,680
of Dai Xiaoyu and me.

1079
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:28,640
Alright.

1080
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:29,840
30th birthday.

1081
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:35,240
We were born on the same day in the same month of the same year.

1082
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:38,640
We just talked about something.

1083
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:39,960
From now on...

1084
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:42,000
You shall solve your problem of being single.

1085
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:45,520
Stop it.

1086
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:47,080
From now on,

1087
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:49,560
I call her Dai

1088
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,880
and she calls me Liu.

1089
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:55,600
Why do they make a fuss about this?

1090
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:57,600
It's just pure friendship

1091
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:58,880
between the two of us.

1092
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:02,760
Alright.

1093
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:04,840
Wait a moment, I haven't finished.

1094
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:06,480
Well...

1095
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:08,840
What was I about to say?

1096
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:09,520
You forgot it.

1097
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:11,360
You forgot it.

1098
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:12,120
I forgot it.

1099
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:14,040
It's all because of you.

1100
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:15,080
Dude, listen.

1101
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:17,440
If you're bad at words, shut up.

1102
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:18,560
Don't keep us from drinking.

1103
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:21,160
However, we only have one question.

1104
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:22,400
Who is this pretty lady

1105
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:24,320
to you?

1106
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:26,160
Just be honest with us, okay?

1107
00:36:27,570 --> 00:36:29,040
If you confess, we'll be hard on you.

1108
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:30,200
If you don't, we'll be harder on you.

1109
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:31,280
Come on.

1110
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:33,360
Can't normal friends celebrate birthdays together?

1111
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:34,200
No.

1112
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:39,920
Dai,

1113
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:47,280
If you say it like that,

1114
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:50,640
let's do something that can't be undone.

1115
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:53,880
After all, we are

1116
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:54,960
a match made in heaven.

1117
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:57,220
I'm not doing whatever you're talking about.

1118
00:36:57,220 --> 00:36:58,600
Do you still want to be friends with me?

1119
00:36:58,600 --> 00:36:59,560
Stand away from me a bit.

1120
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:00,320
Dude,

1121
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:02,280
seems like you don't have a chance.

1122
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:05,480
Even if I did, you ruined it.

1123
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:12,480
Wow, a present.

1124
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:15,760
That's a big ring.

1125
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:19,120
Because your family name rhymes with wear,

1126
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:21,040
I'm gifting you something to wear.

1127
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:23,240
Although this bracelet isn't very expensive,

1128
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:25,880
I customized it from a craftsman.

1129
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,880
Your name

1130
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:29,080
and your birthday

1131
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:30,280
are carved on it.

1132
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:31,800
Did you carve your name and your birthday

1133
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:32,960
on it as well?

1134
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:43,640
Thank you, Liu.

1135
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:46,200
I haven't got any presents for you.

1136
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:48,680
My gift for Liu today

1137
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:52,360
is that I'll pay for this birthday party.

1138
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:57,240
Why don't the two of you hug each other?

1139
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:58,040
Bao Xue.

1140
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:00,000
Don't.

1141
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,320
Yu doesn't like him.

1142
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:02,600
I was just kidding.

1143
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:04,520
Wait and see.

1144
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:05,560
Since your sis said it,

1145
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:07,520
we can't let her down.

1146
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:09,120
Come here.

1147
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:11,360
Happy birthday.

1148
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:16,960
Here. Let's give a toast to Mr. and Ms. Birthday.

1149
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:18,920
Cheers. Happy Birthday.

1150
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:21,800
Happy Birthday.

1151
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:38,140
