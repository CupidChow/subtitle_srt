How is that profound?

Chickens and ducks won't go inside the coops.

I'm also talking about relationships, Sister.

Why do the fish in Houhai Lake

84
00:04:56,159 --> 00:04:57,680
keep jumping out of water

85
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:58,640
before heavy rain?

86
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:00,120
Because the air pressure

87
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:02,320
disrupts the relationship between the fish and the water.

88

that Chai Yong

105
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:35,200
may have ulterior motives towards Xiaoyu?

106
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,080
I think so.

107
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,640

175
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:39,560
Remember to plug it in

176
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:41,320
an hour later.

177
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:42,160
I've moved everything in it

178
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,760
to the freezer.

179
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,160
Look.

180
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,040
Move these with sticky notes

181
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,680
back to the refrigerator once it's plugged in.

182
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,400
Or, if we thaw them tomorrow,

183
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:52,400
we won't be able to run the restaurant at all.

184
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:53,280
Got it.

185
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:54,600
As to the fish you mentioned,

186
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,120
don't forget to put them

187
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,520
in the refrigerator.

188
00:09:58,680 --> 00:09:59,520
Don't worry.

189
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:00,360
Got it?

190
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,080
No problem.

191
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,320
I'm off then.

192
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,040
See you.

193
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,040
See you.

194
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:08,080
Dai Xiaoyu.

195
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,240
When we were about to leave,

196
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,480
Liu asked you out for dinner the day after tomorrow.

197
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:12,880
Why did you say no?

198
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:16,840
I can see it on your face. Something must be going on.

199
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,680
I don't think we should get any closer.

200
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:22,960
What?

201
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,280
Why?

202
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:25,760
You like him, don't you?

203
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,240
What's the problem?

204
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,000
Maybe I liked him for a moment.

205
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:31,880
But that doesn't mean we're right for each other.

206
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,160
What do you mean by "right"?

207
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:35,600
Tell me what "right" is.

208
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,120
Why do you have to be so materialistic?

209
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,680
You just want to be with someone

210
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:43,120
who has a big house and a luxury car, don't you?

211
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,480
No.

212
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:47,000
It just occurred to me

213
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,800
that I'm already 30.

214
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,240
I can no longer take risks on impulse.

215
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,320
He's a nice guy.

216
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,600
But he has no plans for the future.

217
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,840
He could just spend all his money

218
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,000
on something useless.

219
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,800
I can't live with him like that.

220
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:02,920
If I'm with him,

221
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:04,440
I may be happy for a while.

222
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:05,880
But we won't have a stable life.

223
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:08,320
You don't need to rush anything.

224
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:10,120
Look at Yu Songyang and me!

225
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,280
Even though we seem to get along,

226
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:13,000
we are different in many aspects.

227
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,440
It takes time to know someone.

228
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:17,960
You two have different hobbies.

229
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:20,960
But Liu and I have different values.

230
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,760
This isn't something that time can solve.

231
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,400
It just won't work out between us.

232
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,520
So I don't want to waste his time.

233
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:30,440
I'll just gradually withdraw from him.

234
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:31,080
Wait.

235
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:31,680
Sister,

236
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,560
in my opinion,

237
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:35,280
don't draw conclusions too early.

238
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:36,840
You already thought about

239
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:37,960
your future together.

240
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:38,720
It means

241
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:41,160
that you still have feelings for him.

242
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,880
Give each other a chance.

243
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:45,760
Maybe he will change for you.

244
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:46,520
Right?

245
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:49,360
I won't ask anyone to change for me.

246
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:52,000
Because I'll never change for anybody.

247
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:55,680
Do not impose on others
what you yourself do not desire.

248
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:58,440
Nothing is definite.

249
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,040
The only thing predictable about life

250
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,240
is its unpredictability.

251
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,120
Thanks.

252
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,080
Good night.

253
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,760
Just think about what I said.

254
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:16,240
Hello?

255
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,320
I'm not disturbing you, am I?

256
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:20,440
Not at all.

257
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,000
I'm home now.

258
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,120
Where are you?

259
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,160
I'm at the restaurant.

260
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:27,200
I haven't shown you our restaurant, have I?

261
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,240
Let me show you around.

262
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:33,920
Feng Xi,

263
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,160
I've got something to tell you.

264
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,080
Sure.

265
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:40,320
We should break up.

266
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:45,400
Wait a second.

267
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:46,240
Hang on.

268
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,320
Hello. It's your delivery.

269
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:53,160
Thanks.

270
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:53,960
No problem.

271
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:18,720
Feng Xi,

272
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,760
I know you're upset.

273
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:26,080
Me too.

274
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,080
But I have to be honest with you.

275
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:31,200
I don't want to waste your time.

276
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,960
You don't want to waste my time?

277
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:36,880
Oh, you're so generous!

278
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,160
We've been together for ten years.

279
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:45,240
Now you're telling me
that you don't want to waste my time?

280
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,160
Li Xiang, how could you be so heartless?

281
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:51,880
Go ahead.

282
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,960
I'll accept anything you say

283
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,040
if it makes you feel better.

284
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:06,920
May I know why?

285
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:08,200
Feng Xi,

286
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,200
I don't think we are compatible
in terms of temperament.

287
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:12,440
Temperament?

288
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,440
When you were pursuing me,

289
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,000
have you thought about our temperaments?

290
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:18,880
I stayed by your side
from your middle school to postdoctoral study.

291
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:20,760
Why have you never mentioned
our temperaments are incompatible?

292
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:24,040
When I took care of you

293
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:24,960
like your mom,

294
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,520
have you ever thought about our temperaments?

295
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:27,840
When you

296
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:28,600
wanted to sleep with me,

297
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:30,320
why didn't you consider
that our temperaments are incompatible?

298
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,080
Now you're so successful,

299
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:33,880
a promising scientist.

300
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:35,680
Suddenly, you feel
that we have incompatible temperaments?

301
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:37,840
Li Xiang,

302
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:42,000
why did you do this to me?

303
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,640
You ungrateful jerk!

304
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:47,520
Feng Xi,

305
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:49,120
can you calm down?

306
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:52,480
I really want to talk to you.

307
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:53,640
If you want to curse me,

308
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:54,600
go ahead.

309
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,240
I'll listen to every word you say.

310
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,480
I'll wait for you to calm down

311
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,720
so that we can talk.

312
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:14,960
I don't want to talk.

313
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,480
Don't imagine anything.

314
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:21,240
There's no one else.

315
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:26,360
You know, during my time abroad, I realized

316
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:28,040
that it's my first time to live on my own,

317
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:31,040
the first time to live without you.

318
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,880
I've learned to take care of myself.

319
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:36,560
I realized

320
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,600
that it's not so hard to take care of myself.

321
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,000
What's more, it occurred to me

322
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:43,760
that my feelings for you

323
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:45,920
have always been an emotional attachment

324
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,280
instead of love.

325
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:51,000
I don't want to lie to you.

326
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:55,320
Now I just want to focus all my time and energy

327
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:57,840
on my research and career.

328
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:59,560
To be honest,

329
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:02,760
every time I come back to my dorm,

330
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,320
I start thinking about us.

331
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:07,720
It just distracts me and exhausts me.

332
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:11,480
If I have some time to my own,

333
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:12,920
I just want to read more

334
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:15,320
or talk to my tutor.

335
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:18,440
At this stage of my life,

336
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,600
I don't want to spend time

337
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,480
on relationships.

338
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:25,320
But I love you so much.

339
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:27,960
Li Xiang, how could you?

340
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:35,600
What do I need to do to make you come back?

341
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:38,480
Feng Xi, you don't need to do anything.

342
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:40,840
Just start your own life.

343
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:55,360
I'm sorry, Feng Xi.

344
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:01,000
I don't love you anymore.

345
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:04,319
That's all I want to say.

346
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:49,680
[Crossroad Bistro]

347
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:18,760
Who's there?

348
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,200
Why did you sleep here?

349
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,360
How much did you drink?

350
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,120
Not much.

351
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:43,240
Did you cry?

352
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:45,400
No.

353
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:48,760
Did you put the fish in?

354
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:50,240
Yes.

355
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:09,400
Where is the fish?

356
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:14,600
Here.

357
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,800
You froze the fish?

358
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,040
Are you an idiot?

359
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:20,000
Get out of my way.

360
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:24,160
I forgot.

361
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:25,160
You forgot?

362
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:28,920
Here. Take a look yourself.

363
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,360
Look at it!

364
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,920
Even if you had put it outside,

365
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:34,880
it would've been OK with all the ice packs.

366
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,480
You just ruined the fish by freezing it.

367
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,240
Do you know that?

368
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:38,320
It's all ruined.

369
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:40,840
And also, I told you

370
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:42,120
to move the food from the freezer back to the refrigerator.

371
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:42,840
Did you do that?

372
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:44,480
Are they still in the freezer?

373
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:45,920
I told you what to do specifically, didn't I?

374
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:47,000
What can we do now?

375
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,080
Tell me!

376
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,440
Should we even open the restaurant today?

377
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:50,840
Maybe we'll just serve vegetarian dishes!

378
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,360
How could you fail

379
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:54,120
at something as simple as that?

380
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:11,000
I'm sorry.

381
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:30,040
All right.

382
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,120
Stop crying.

383
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:34,440
Stop crying.

384
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:37,840
Tell them immediately.

385
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:39,120
We can't do it today.

386
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:40,760
Please.

387
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,520
There might be other ways.

388
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:57,720
Feng Xi.

389
00:20:58,680 --> 00:20:59,480
Li Xiang again!

390
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:01,520
Can you think of anything other than him?

391
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:02,880
Not only do I want to yell at you,

392
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:04,400
I also want to punch you in the face!

393
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:08,960
Wait for my call.

394
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:24,960
Hello?

395
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:26,720
I'm up.

396
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:30,560
What?

397
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:35,080
How did that happen?

398
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:43,280
Xiaoyu,

399
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:44,880
I'm sorry.

400
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,800
You feel sorry?

401
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:50,720
Maybe I should thank you.

402
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:52,280
Thanks to you,

403
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:53,480
I'll become famous across the company.

404
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:54,680
Do you have any idea?

405
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:57,440
I promised to my boss and clients,

406
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:59,480
and you promised to me.

407
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:01,280
Your promises are just jokes, huh?

408
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:03,520
I didn't mean it.

409
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:06,120
I was too sad.

410
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,960
Go home if you're sad!

411
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:09,360
This is business!

412
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:12,600
Do you think we invest in your personal growth?

413
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:15,360
Maybe we should hug you and cry for you.

414
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:19,160
Do you know how important this guest is for Mr. Chai?

415
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:20,040
Do you have any idea

416
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:22,400
how difficult it was even to buy that fish?

417
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:25,600
This is literally a dinner for the fish!

418
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:27,400
What can I do now?

419
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:29,120
Any alternative?

420
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:31,480
How do I tell Mr. Chai?

421
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,240
Back then, I actually didn't trust your ability.

422
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,200
But You Shanshan trusts you.

423
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:43,240
Do you know why?

424
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:45,600
Because even though you're not young,

425
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,480
you have little experience,

426
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:49,400
especially with men.

427
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:50,400
Xiaoyu,

428
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,320
I'm also responsible for this.

429
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:53,200
If I hadn't...

430
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,720
Don't speak for her!

431
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:56,720
If I don't scold her hard this time,

432
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,240
she'll just do it again.

433
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:02,520
Are you clear?

434
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:03,760
Enough!

435
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:07,360
We should focus on the problem.

436
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,640
Control your emotions a bit.

437
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,440
What's the point of yelling at her?

438
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:11,840
We should figure something out

439
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:13,520
instead of wasting time here.

440
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:14,800
Even if you cursed her to death,

441
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:16,320
the fish would still be ruined.

442
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:20,920
Listen.

443
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:26,720
I'll go to every seafood market to find the fish.

444
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,240
Post on your WeChat Moments

445
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,160
to ask if any of your peers can help.

446
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:31,520
Of course.

447
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:33,080
Xiaoyu.

448
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:34,800
Xiaoyu.

449
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:39,760
Calm down.

450
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,160
Give Chai Yong a call

451
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,480
and tell him everything.

452
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:44,680
Don't lie.

453
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:45,960
No matter how angry he gets,

454
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:47,000
you'll have to face it.

455
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:48,800
At least, you can show him a good attitude.

456
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,440
I'm off to find that fish.

457
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:07,080
Don't be upset anymore.

458
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:24,320
Do you know who my guest is?

459
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:28,560
Liu Zhaoxi, the founder of Mache.

460
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:31,640
Do you know how important this dinner is?

461
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,480
It's a project of hundreds of millions.

462
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:39,720
Do you know how much trouble

463
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:42,200
I went through only to get this empurau fish?

464
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,800
Do you have any idea how much money I spent

465
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:44,720
and how many calls I made?

466
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:45,840
Mr. Chai,

467
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:47,480
it's all my fault.

468
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,040
I'm also responsible for this.

469
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:50,440
Please calm down.

470
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,160
Let's find a solution.

471
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:53,440
No matter what happens,

472
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,400
this dinner is on us.

473
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:57,320
Do you think I need you to pay for this dinner,

474
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:58,360
Dai Xiaoyu?

475
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:01,240
You know that I chose your restaurant

476
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:03,160
as a favor to your business, right?

477
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:05,200
Dai Xiaoyu,

478
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:07,600
did you tell me so confidently

479
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:08,840
that everything would be OK?

480
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:09,960
Did you?

481
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:13,640
Then why didn't you keep a close eye on it?

482
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:15,600
I pay you every month

483
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,280
so that

484
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:19,600
you can ruin important deals for me,

485
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:20,640
right?

486
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:22,800
Mr. Chai,

487
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:24,360
I think it's more important

488
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:25,920
that we figure something out first.

489
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:27,320
You may yell at me all you want.

490
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:28,440
But the problem is still there.

491
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:29,760
Who can figure anything out?

492
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:32,800
Me?

493
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,240
I spent all the money

494
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:37,320
only to find out that you ruined my fish.

495
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:38,760
And I need to figure something out?

496
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,600
Sorry, I can't!

497
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:43,920
Just search every seafood market in Beijing

498
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:45,520
to find that fish.

499
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:47,880
Ms. You has gone

500
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,680
to the best seafood markets in Beijing

501
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:51,680
and bought the best leopard coral trout
and hairy crabs.

502
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:54,640
Do you think I can't eat these anywhere else?

503
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:59,280
Do you know what empurau fish is?

504
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:02,680
Anyway, you must give me a solution.

505
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:04,640
I already told the clients about that fish.

506
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:08,440
The dinner will start at six this evening.

507
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:10,040
If you embarrass me

508
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:12,800
because of this,

509
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,240
I'll fire you

510
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:19,000
and refund my membership card here.

511
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:22,720
I've never heard of

512
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:23,920
something as stupid as this.

513
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:33,040
OK, I see.

514
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,640
I'm not scaring you.

515
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:37,560
But if anything goes wrong today,

516
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:38,960
Mr. Chai will refund his card

517
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,680
and you'll cover the loss.

518
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:44,880
Thanks, Dad.

519
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:47,120
How's it going?

520
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:48,080
Yi Tang,

521
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:49,240
prepare the soup.

522
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:50,320
Use sea cucumbers, abalone,
matsutake, and chicken as the base.

523
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:52,040
Meanwhile,
prepare eight Lion's Head meatballs with crab meat.

524
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:52,920
OK. Got it.

525
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:53,800
Fan,

526
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,240
make an M7 steak, half-cooked.

527
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:56,120
Steam the crabs and fish

528
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:57,280
that Ms. You bought.

529
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:58,200
And prepare a bottle of Qinghua Lang wine.

530
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:58,920
Sure.

531
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:00,000
Sun,

532
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,160
get me the best soft tofu immediately.

533
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,240
How much do you need?

534
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:04,400
How many of them?

535
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:05,680
Six.

536
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:06,400
Then six servings.

537
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,160
I'll call my driver.

538
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:08,640
Come with me.

539
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,360
Just wait here.

540
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:25,400
I'll let you know when to come in.

541
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,120
OK.

542
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,600
The courses I ordered today

543
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:29,840
are nothing special.

544
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:30,640
You're too kind.

545
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:31,840
Just like homemade dishes.

546
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:32,920
Mr. Chai.

547
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:34,680
Let me introduce this lady.

548
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:35,160
Mr. Liu,

549
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:35,920
this is my friend

550
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:38,080
and the owner of this restaurant, You Shanshan.

551
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,120
Mr. Liu.

552
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:40,280
Nice to meet you, Mr. Liu.

553
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:41,120
Nice to meet you, Ms. You.

554
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:43,360
I don't feel comfortable when people call me "Mr. Liu".

555
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:44,320
Even in my company,

556
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:45,880
nobody calls me that.

557
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:48,520
Then how do you prefer to be addressed?

558
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:50,120
We call him Dr. Liu.

559
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,280
You can also call me Charles.

560
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:53,520
Then I'll do as everyone else does.

561
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:54,800
Dr. Liu.

562
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:58,560
Actually, I'm here to apologize to you.

563
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:02,000
How come?

564
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:03,160
Let me explain.

565
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,880
Due to the omission in our work,

566
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:06,760
we accidentally froze the empurau fish

567
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:08,680
Mr. Chai bought it specially for you.

568
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:09,920
I know you must have heard

569
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:10,600
that empurau fish

570
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:13,120
must be cooked fresh.

571
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:15,120
It's our fault.

572
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,360
I apologize with all my heart.

573
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:19,880
Ms. You, you don't need to do that.

574
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:21,760
Don't...

575
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:25,280
Shanshan…

576
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:26,040
It's our fault.

577
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:26,720
…sit down.

578
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:28,000
You shouldn't have.

579
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:29,040
Sit.

580
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:32,680
Ms. You, you're too kind.

581
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:33,960
I came here today

582
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:36,080
not just for dinner.

583
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:38,040
What matters

584
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:38,960
is that this afternoon

585
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:41,120
Mr. Chai and I had a good meeting.

586
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:42,360
In my view,

587
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:43,960
what's most important

588
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:45,360
is that our companies cooperate successfully

589
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:47,080
on this project.

590
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:48,040
You're right.

591
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:49,560
As to what kind of fish we eat,

592
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:51,240
I don't think it really matters.

593
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:51,960
What do you think, Mr. Chai?

594
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:52,560
Of course.

595
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:54,640
You see? I told you

596
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:55,560
that Mr. Liu is a generous person.

597
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:56,240
Of course.

598
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:57,200
Thanks for your understanding.

599
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:58,320
Please allow me

600
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:00,200
to make an apology.

601
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:01,000
No worries.

602
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,200
Thank you, Mr. Chai.

603
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:05,000
Suit yourself.

604
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:06,680
Mr. Chai,

605
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:08,120
actually, people in the IT industry

606
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,560
are quite different.

607
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:11,000
We don't stick to the rules.

608
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:14,600
I don't have a dress code for my employees.

609
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:16,360
It's OK as long as they're comfortable.

610
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:19,080
In my view, we don't need to force anything.

611
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:21,040
What is meant to happen will happen.

612
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:21,600
Do you agree?

613
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:22,800
Absolutely.

614
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:24,320
It's just so hard

615
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:25,760
to have a boss like you.

616
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:26,360
Right?

617
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,160
Definitely.

618
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:29,360
To show our sincerity,

619
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:31,920
we especially changed the main course.

620
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:34,480
Can we serve it now?

621
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:36,600
Sure.

622
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:37,920
Go ahead.

623
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:41,040
Feng Xi, serve the main course.

624
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:42,240
OK.

625
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:53,360
What our chef is making for our guests

626
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:55,240
is called hydrangea tofu.

627
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:26,920
The tofu is cut 80 times horizontally

628
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:28,360
and 80 times vertically.

629
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:29,720
The chef can't cut off any piece

630
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:31,520
and must make sure that each cut is of the same depth.

631
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:52,600
Then the tofu is slightly shaken in the water

632
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:54,240
so that it blooms

633
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:57,640
into a hydrangea flower with 6,400 petals.

634
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:03,360
Steamed Lion's Head meatballs with crab meat,
coupled with hydrangea tofu.

635
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:05,840
And the soup has sea cucumbers,
abalone, and matsutake as its base,

636
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:06,000
海参 鲍鱼 松茸吊的汤

637
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,400
enhanced by the aroma of white wine.

638
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:09,880
Enjoy.

639
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:11,160
Dr. Liu,

640
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:14,000
the tofu was cut 80 times horizontally and 80 times vertically.

641
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:17,600
It even turned into a flower with 6,400 petals.

642
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:18,720
The chef's cutting skill

643
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:20,680
is just magnificent.

644
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,120
It's amazing.

645
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:24,680
What an exquisite dish!

646
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:27,680
The spring rain promises a good year,

647
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:29,840
and the lions and hydrangea flowers symbolize good luck.

648
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:33,240
Mr. Chai, Dr. Liu, I wish us a successful cooperation!

649
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:34,600
Thanks.

650
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:39,360
Dr. Liu,

651
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:41,400
I took the liberty

652
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:45,120
to change the main course
from empurau fish to hydrangea tofu.

653
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:47,040
I hope you like it.

654
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:47,960
Mr. Chai.

655
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:51,000
Even though empurau fish is very rare,

656
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:52,520
I'll always have a chance to taste it.

657
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:55,840
I've heard so much about hydrangea tofu.

658
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:57,200
But I never had a chance

659
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:58,640
to see for myself how it's made.

660
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:00,560
Today I'm so lucky

661
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:02,160
to watch the whole process.

662
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:03,280
Don't mention it.

663
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:04,400
What's more,

664
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,680
I like what it symbolizes.

665
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:07,760
Enlighten me.

666
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:09,600
The hydrangea flower

667
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:13,600
symbolizes a promising future

668
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:16,120
that we will make together.

669
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:18,080
Dr. Liu knows it too well.

670
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:19,600
You totally got our intentions.

671
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:20,320
Right?

672
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:21,800
Come on. Fill your glasses.

673
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:22,760
Come on.

674
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:24,720
Shanshan, Xiaoyu, raise your glasses.

675
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:28,800
Let's wish
that Dr. Liu and I will work together successfully.

676
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:31,360
Wish us all good luck!

677
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:33,120
Good luck!

678
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:34,000
Thanks.

679
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:37,240
Have a taste.

680
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:38,760
I can't bear to see it ruined.

681
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:40,800
I'll prepare a big red packet for Zhao Haonan.

682
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:42,600
Absolutely.

683
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:00,720
Why are you washing the dishes?

684
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:03,360
That's OK.

685
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:09,800
Just go home.

686
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:13,360
All right.

687
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:29,120
Why are you still here?

688
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:31,760
Get on. I'll ride you home.

689
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:35,080
♫ Bitter, spicy, savory, sweet, sour♫

690
00:33:37,210 --> 00:33:41,480
♫ Love, hate, emotions, revenge, grudges♫

691
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:49,950
♫ My mood is on a rollercoaster ride♫

692
00:33:48,880 --> 00:34:30,600
[Please wear a helmet and drive safe.
 Do not imitate this scene.]

693
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:56,200
♫ We are on the crossroad♫

694
00:34:11,389 --> 00:34:14,650
♫ Don't look back♫

695
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:18,100
♫ Just let me go♫

696
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:20,900
♫ Give me a warm hug♫

697
00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:25,190
♫ A kiss that feels distant♫

698
00:34:25,420 --> 00:34:28,380
♫ I can't curb my enthusiasm♫

699
00:34:28,659 --> 00:34:32,010
♫ I will always remember my dream♫

700
00:34:32,429 --> 00:34:34,780
♫ Forever and ever♫

701
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:40,960
♫ It's the promise I'll never break♫

702
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:52,239
You saved the day.

703
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:53,719
Thank you.

704
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,040
Don't thank me.

705
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:57,680
You should thank my dad.

706
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,280
He taught me how to make that dish.

707
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:01,800
He taught you via the phone?

708
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:03,080
Are you kidding me?

709
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:04,520
It was on the first day

710
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:06,240
I started to work as a chef.

711
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:07,680
He taught me that after I got home.

712
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:10,640
Your father is a chef, too?

713
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:12,200
Yes.

714
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:16,080
Please send my gratitude to your father.

715
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:20,960
I didn't know you just broke up.

716
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:23,600
I kind of lost my temper.

717
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:25,040
I hope you don't mind.

718
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:28,840
But I have to say something.

719
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:32,720
Even though we got through today,

720
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,080
I don't have a lot of skills

721
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:35,960
to save you every time.

722
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:37,400
If this happens again,

723
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:38,880
I'll just quit.
