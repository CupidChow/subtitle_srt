4
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,120
Stop whining.

5
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,160
Put it on.

6
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:42,800
Zhuang.

7
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,680
Are you up? Hurry up.

8
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,480
You don't want to be late for school.

9
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,600
Morning, everyone.

10
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,320
Good morning, daddy.

11
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:12,840
Morning.

12
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,520
Time for breakfast.

13
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,920
What are you doing?

14
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:20,079
Are you eating or playing?

15
00:03:20,079 --> 00:03:21,760
Mix and match?

16
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,200
Mommy.

17
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,760
I think he is making a luxurious meal.

18
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:26,840
You eat it.

19
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,440
I'll watch you eat.

20
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,320
Are you wearing perfume?

21
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,840
Isn't that bottle of Dior for me?

22
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:34,560
It is for you.

23
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,480
But not for you to wear it at work.

24
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,640
I bought it for you to wear after showers.

25
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:39,520
Too fragrant.

26
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,200
Then I made a mistake.

27
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,600
I want to talk to you.

28
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:51,840
I'm busy in the morning.

29
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,400
Can you wait until I come back tonight?

30
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,120
I wanted to talk to you yesterday.

31
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:58,079
But I couldn't because you were so drunk.

32
00:03:58,960 --> 00:03:59,880
OK. What's it?

33
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,520
You Shanshan opened a restaurant.

34
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,920
She wants me to one of the shareholders.

35
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:04,880
Can I?

36
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:10,360
Can I say no?

37
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:13,480
I want to do something on my own.

38
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:16,720
I work hard outside.

39
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,160
You work hard at home.

40
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,459
How nice!

41
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:21,640
A perfect match!

42
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:23,080
I don't understand why you always

43
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:25,640
want to break it.

44
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,320
What for?

45
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:29,080
I don't want to be a nanny for you all my life.

46
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:30,120
OK?

47
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,720
Listen to yourself.

48
00:04:34,159 --> 00:04:36,000
We are all working for this family.

49
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,560
It's just that we have different positions.

50
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,920
It's not about our positions in the family.

51
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:42,040
I just want to live a more fulfilling life.

52
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,200
OK?

53
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,120
Mommy.

54
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,840
I'm full.

55
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:52,200
Go get ready for school.

56
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,040
OK.

57
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:53,440
Zhuang.

58
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,720
Take your sister to pack her bag.

59
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,680
Thanks, mommy.

60
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:57,920
Wipe your mouth.

61
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,760
Don't use your hand. Use tissue.

62
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:00,680
Go. Go. Go.

63
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,280
Bye, daddy.

64
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:11,000
How much will it cost?

65
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:11,880
Not much.

66
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,120
300,000 RMB.

67
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,440
Didn't you just meet her?

68
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,920
How many times have you met?

69
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,360
Have you been to her house?

70
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,040
Have you been to her company?

71
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,680
She wants 300,000 RMB from you.

72
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,440
Are you sure she is not a fraud?

73
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:34,720
Do you think I'm a fool?

74
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,580
That I can't distinguish the good from the bad,

75
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:37,520
right?

76
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,500
Don't you often sign contracts 
worth millions of RMB

77
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:41,320
as soon as you meet a client?

78
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,200
It's different.

79
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,200
We take money.

80
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,800
We don't pay others.

81
00:05:47,159 --> 00:05:48,520
300,000.

82
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,800
That's not 300.

83
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,400
We don't have that much spare cash.

84
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,520
We do.

85
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,200
Yea, we do.

86
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,280
If you spend it,

87
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,840
how should we pay for the daily expenses?

88
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,840
What about the mortgage?

89
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,800
The children?

90
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,720
We have four parents

91
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,120
who are not getting any younger.

92
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:05,840
We will be broke if any of them gets sick.

93
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:08,160
You can't be unprepared.

94
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,000
Don't expect restaurants

95
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
to be a stable income.

96
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,360
Good if it's profitable.

97
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,520
But what if it's not?

98
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:19,640
You Shanshan is successful.

99
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:21,280
We can't compare with her.

100
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,640
If you lose every penny,

101
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:24,240
what are you gonna do then?

102
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,080
Xu from the audit department

103
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,280
has saved some money.

104
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,640
One day, he decided to

105
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,080
invest in stocks with his friends on a whim.

106
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:33,800
He swore that

107
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,400
he would only do short-terms and not be greedy.

108
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,120
After several successful investments,

109
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:38,760
he went bold

110
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:39,720
and invested all his money.

111
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:40,200
Well,

112
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,120
he was wiped out.

113
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,080
And now,

114
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:45,400
his mother-in-law needs money for surgery.

115
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,920
He's borrowing money from everyone,

116
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,520
like a loser.

117
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:50,280
If only he hadn't invested in the first place...

118
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,320
I also knew someone
 who opened a beauty salon with friends.

119
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:55,240
OK. You can stop it.

120
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,080
Eat your breakfast.

121
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,960
They are all real-life lessons.

122
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:58,880
Right in front of your eyes.

123
00:06:58,880 --> 00:06:59,400
What...

124
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,920
Let's pretend I didn't say anything, OK?

125
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,240
Stop nagging.

126
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:08,340
I don't have to entertain clients today.

127
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,760
I'll come home for dinner after work.

128
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:12,400
I've missed your cooking.

129
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,320
The food at home is always better than outside.

130
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:30,480
Get on the bus.

131
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,120
Goodbye, mom.

132
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,000
Bye.

133
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:34,840
Good morning.

134
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:35,520
Morning.

135
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:36,520
Good morning, sweethearts.

136
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:37,360
Good morning.

137
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,560
Hello.

138
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,040
Take care.

139
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:39,880
Get on one by one.

140
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:41,080
Be careful.

141
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:42,480
Sit.

142
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,920
Sit in your seat.

143
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,680
The editor recommended 
your official account to me.

144
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,160
I've read every issue.

145
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:25,160
Your essays and stories

146
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:27,920
are novel and unique.

147
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:29,600
Thank you.

148
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,400
Are you familiar with our editor?

149
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,110
We are e-friends.

150
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:35,890
We've known each other for a long time,

151
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:37,120
but we only chatted online

152
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:37,860
and never met.

153
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:39,880
She is in a meeting.

154
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:42,620
You can see her in a while.

155
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:43,480
OK.

156
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:45,280
I invite you over this time

157
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:47,040
because I want to talk to you about something.

158
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:51,440
We want to select several of your short stories

159
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,240
and make them into a short video series.

160
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,640
Would you let us do that?

161
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:57,280
Of course.

162
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:59,400
But I have never been a screenwriter.

163
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:00,240
I don't know...

164
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,480
Don't worry.

165
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,560
We just want to buy your copyright.

166
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,360
The screenwriters of our company

167
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,680
will adapt it into a script.

168
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,080
Here are a few works

169
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,480
I picked out from your articles

170
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:15,000
Here, take a look.

171
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:21,160
There are 20 articles

172
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,640
in total.

173
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,400
10,000 RMB

174
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:27,760
per article.

175
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,440
Is that okay?

176
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:32,680
Sure.

177
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,520
Great.

178
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:38,360
If you have no objection,

179
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:40,400
we can sign the contract now.

180
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,360
-Alright?
-OK.

181
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,000
Here is the contract.

182
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:52,480
Hello?

183
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,320
Are you free at noon?

184
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,360
Let's have lunch together. My treat.

185
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:00,600
Don't ask.

186
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,920
I'll book a place and tell you.

187
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,600
See you later. Bye.

188
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:25,640
Did you win the lottery?

189
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:27,560
I'm happier than winning the lottery.

190
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,000
Won the lottery twice in a row?

191
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,880
It's not the lottery.

192
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:34,600
My articles are going to be 
made into a short TV series.

193
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:37,560
The film company gave me 
200,000 RMB contribution fees.

194
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:40,000
200,000  RMB!

195
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:42,440
Seriously speaking,

196
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:44,080
This is the biggest money

197
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:46,280
I have ever made.

198
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:48,120
I really admire you literati.

199
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:50,200
200,000 RMB for an article.

200
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,680
If you write 100 stories,

201
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,440
you'll soon be a billionaire.

202
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,200
Not one.

203
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:56,080
Twenty.

204
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,040
Twenty stories

205
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,160
for 200,000 RMB?

206
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:03,200
How many words do you have to write in one article?

207
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,600
A few thousand words.

208
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,120
Then it's not good.

209
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,200
I heard from Bao Xue,

210
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,560
The screenwriter of her TV series

211
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,800
writes about 10000 words for one episode

212
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,000
and gets hundreds of thousands RMB of pay.

213
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,160
I can't compare with them

214
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:17,600
I'm satisfied with what I got now.

215
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,680
You should work harder.

216
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,040
If you write ten more articles,

217
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:24,080
you will be able to invest in the restaurant.

218
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,200
Don't get me started on that.

219
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:28,120
I told my husband about this in the morning.

220
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:29,920
He didn't agree.

221
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,280
We almost had a fight.

222
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,480
I know you are not the decision-maker of your house.

223
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:38,640
But I have to say.

224
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,160
There are risks in business.

225
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,000
It's normal for your husband to disagree.

226
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,840
Don't quarrel with him about this.

227
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,280
It's not worth it.

228
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:46,000
If he

229
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
gets furious and throws you out,

230
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,120
and make you a broken divorcee with two children,

231
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:55,520
I'll feel incredibly guilty.

232
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,680
Thank you for your warm words.

233
00:11:58,680 --> 00:11:59,640
I appreciate that.

234
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:00,640
Now eat.

235
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:02,120
I think I'm so cute.

236
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:04,440
The soup is good.

237
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,960
I want to taste yours.

238
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:08,160
Boys and girls.

239
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,280
We are home.

240
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:10,560
Come on.

241
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,440
Be ready to get off.

242
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,120
Come.

243
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:15,640
Get off.

244
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:16,800
Going home.

245
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:17,320
Mom.

246
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,960
Watch out.

247
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,720
Our teacher gave us a reading list.

248
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:22,120
Reading list?

249
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:23,560
Go.

250
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:24,880
Let's pick up your sister 
and go to the bookstore.

251
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,280
Come in.

252
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:32,800
Let's go.

253
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,560
Listen,

254
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,120
I'm in a good mood today.

255
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,880
You can pick whatever you want.

256
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:40,240
Go.

257
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:40,800
Great!

258
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:41,800
Shhhh.

259
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,160
Zhuang. Look after your sister.

260
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:43,960
Got it.

261
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:09,440
Zhuang.

262
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:13,560
Mommy seems to be different today.

263
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:19,360
She bought me tons and tons of snacks today.

264
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,120
Yeah.

265
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:24,360
She didn't force me to do homework today.

266
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:33,920
You don't need to urge me like 800 times a day.

267
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,640
I am trying!

268
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:36,800
Yeah. I'm on the waiting list.

269
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:37,960
He is very famous.

270
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:39,680
Straight five-star reviews.

271
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:41,200
By the way,

272
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,760
the platform prohibits chefs from

273
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:44,000
going to restaurants to cook.

274
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:46,520
I'll make an appointment at my house.

275
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:47,560
Are you coming?

276
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,400
I can't make an appointment tonight.

277
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,760
How about tomorrow at noon?

278
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:53,800
OK.

279
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:57,280
You pay for it.

280
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:57,920
OK.

281
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:00,800
OK.

282
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:01,880
Bye.

283
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:05,840
Du Shijun.

284
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:06,560
Dinner.

285
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:07,360
Coming.

286
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,920
We are having dumplings.

287
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:10,720
Dumplings.

288
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,560
Is it New Year?

289
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:15,120
No, we can have dumplings any day we want.

290
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:17,960
How about some liquor?

291
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,040
What's happening?

292
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,440
Shunpin Lang Spirits.

293
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:23,560
Rich flavors.

294
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:24,400
Strong aroma.

295
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:25,520
Nice.

296
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,280
Do you have any good news?

297
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:28,120
Take a guess.

298
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:29,120
Daddy, you should say

299
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,920
you take a guess whether I take a guess.

300
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:31,680
I have to guess.

301
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:32,840
Eat.

302
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,600
Could it be...

303
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:36,880
Zhuang, you got two As?

304
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,520
You're drunk before you drink it.

305
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,240
Dad,

306
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:43,120
Don't give me so much pressure, OK?

307
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:44,920
Pressure is motivation.

308
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:50,160
Are they

309
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,920
going to have a brother or a sister?

310
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:53,760
Really?

311
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:56,200
I'd like a brother.

312
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,080
Why?

313
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,240
Sisters are high-maintenance.

314
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,920
Do you even know what is high-maintenance?

315
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,160
Mommy.

316
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:05,800
Can you give birth to a cute puppy for me

317
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:09,240
after giving birth to my brother?

318
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:11,120
A toy poodle would be the best.

319
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,920
You are silly.

320
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:14,400
Only a dog can give birth to a dog.

321
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:15,920
Humans can only give birth to humans.

322
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:18,800
What is it?

323
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:23,320
The article I wrote

324
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,760
was bought by a film company.

325
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,080
They gave me 200,000 RMB as contribution fees.

326
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,080
How much?

327
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:31,800
200,000?

328
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:36,440
Then I'll have to

329
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:37,880
make a toast

330
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:39,320
with our son and daughter

331
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:40,440
to you, a great mother.

332
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,840
You drink it.

333
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:42,840
Bottoms up!

334
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,800
I want to drink too.

335
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:45,720
Cheers!

336
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:46,600
Me, too!

337
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:47,520
Cheers!

338
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:49,400
Congratulations to mommy.

339
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:54,000
This is my drink.

340
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,400
You haven't drink it yet.

341
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:58,600
I'll have to say.

342
00:15:58,600 --> 00:15:59,840
We cannot get carried away.

343
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:01,080
Don't be dazzled

344
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:03,200
by the victory.

345
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,120
This money will be used to repay the mortgage.

346
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,660
At the end of the year,

347
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:13,880
I'll get my dividend.

348
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:15,920
Then our mortgage

349
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,880
will be completely paid off.

350
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:20,200
Good idea!

351
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:21,520
Isn't it?

352
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:23,200
How about this arrangement?

353
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,360
Great!

354
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:28,400
Thank you, mommy.

355
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,760
Thank you for being a great mommy!

356
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:55,120
Who allowed you to paint here?

357
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:58,160
All of our teachers

358
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,760
draw on the wall of the kindergarten.

359
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,520
The wall of your kindergarten

360
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:03,720
is used for painting.

361
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:05,040
Ours is not!

362
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:07,119
Look at what you've done to this frame.

363
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,560
Why?

364
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:13,839
Why can I paint on the walls of the kindergarten,

365
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:17,359
but not on the wall of our house?

366
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:18,680
No reason.

367
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:19,800
You just listen to what I tell you.

368
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:20,960
No painting on this wall.

369
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:30,160
Mommy, why don't you comfort me?

370
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,040
What you did is wrong.

371
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:32,440
Why should I comfort you?

372
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:36,280
I used to cry like this.

373
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:38,080
Look, I can't wipe it off.

374
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:42,520
I want to run away from home.

375
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:48,440
What a temper.

376
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:50,080
Be my guest.

377
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,160
Take care.

378
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:53,120
Check the traffic lights when crossing the road.

379
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,280
Who is it?

380
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,560
Didn't you run away from home?

381
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:38,640
I have half a Banma session left.

382
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:39,800
I want to finish it,

383
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,320
then have dinner and go to bed.

384
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:44,080
I will go tomorrow.

385
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:47,800
Then you must keep your words.

386
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,840
You have to leave tomorrow after all those things.

387
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,240
Change your shoes.

388
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:53,920
Good girl.

389
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:55,800
Never miss a lesson

390
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,320
even if you want to run away from home,

391
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:58,400
Right?

392
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:11,440
I tried on a dress I got before marriage

393
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:13,000
the other day.

394
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,720
I am no longer fit.

395
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,240
You were energetic when you were twenty years old.

396
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:21,000
And elegant when you are thirty.

397
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,480
No need to be upset.

398
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,760
There are four moods of life.

399
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:27,880
Hurt but not talking about it.

400
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:28,960
Laughing but not saying a word.

401
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,280
Confused but not lost.

402
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:31,240
Shocked but not chaotic.

403
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:33,360
I didn't achieve any of them.

404
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:36,200
No wonder we are married.

405
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:38,120
I can't achieve any of those four,

406
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:39,720
just like you.

407
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,520
You are excellent enough.

408
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:42,720
Almost a role model

409
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,480
for all wives.

410
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,560
Don't make it too hard for

411
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:47,800
other women.

412
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:54,840
Look at me.

413
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:57,600
Am I old?

414
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:58,480
No.

415
00:19:58,480 --> 00:19:59,920
Did you look?

416
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,120
Look carefully.

417
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:05,360
Look closer.

418
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:06,640
Let me wipe my glasses.

419
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:17,000
What a beautiful face.

420
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,200
Not old at all.

421
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,640
Even if you are getting old

422
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,600
I'll grow old with you.

423
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:24,520
The older the man, the more valuable they are.

424
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:26,720
It's the total opposite for women.

425
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:29,200
You are still young.

426
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,800
What are you talking about?

427
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:32,120
Should those who are older than you

428
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:34,800
look for a place to hang themselves now?

429
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:45,440
Stop looking at your phone.

430
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,680
What if one day

431
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:52,600
I become bald

432
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:54,320
and saggy.

433
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:55,520
My eyes look like this

434
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,200
and my nasolabial folds like this.

435
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:57,880
My mouth and

436
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:00,160
dimples become like this.

437
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:01,960
Would you still look at me like this?

438
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,200
I'll still want to look at you in this position.

439
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,920
But I don't know if I can see clearly.

440
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,720
I'm talking seriously.

441
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:13,200
Men just can't be trusted.

442
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,640
What?

443
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:17,160
I should apply more skincare products.

444
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,640
They are more reliable.

445
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,000
You can't rely on those

446
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,240
to stay young forever.

447
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:25,240
You should exercise more.

448
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:28,080
These at least make my skin bright.

449
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,480
Besides, I do exercises.

450
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:30,440
I do yoga every day

451
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:31,600
after kids go to school.

452
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:33,680
That's good.

453
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,280
Don't worry.

454
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:38,560
If you are so old as you say,

455
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:40,080
I'll be probably

456
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,920
dead already.

457
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:43,280
Don't say that.

458
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:44,880
What if I die before you?

459
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:47,840
Then I'm gonna date

460
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,720
a sixty-year-old girl.

461
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:54,760
Sixty years old.

462
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:57,560
Go and get one.

463
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:58,200
What are you doing?

464
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:59,000
I dare you.

465
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
No. Stop.

466
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Stop. Stop.

467
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:04,040
Are you gonna eat me?

468
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:43,960
Hello.

469
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:45,280
I'm the chef you ordered, Zhao Hyeonan.

470
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:46,560
Hi, come in.

471
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:48,760
I'll take that.

472
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:50,040
Thanks.

473
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:50,720
Should I take off my shoes?

474
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:51,440
No.

475
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:55,440
Give it to me.

476
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:56,440
Thanks.

477
00:22:58,960 --> 00:22:59,760
I put my clothes there.

478
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:06,080
Can I start working now?

479
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:06,840
Yeah.

480
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:11,920
What do you think?

481
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:12,920
Are they good?

482
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:14,680
So good.

483
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:16,800
It's better than what I can order in restaurants.

484
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,080
That's good.

485
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:18,840
If it's ok,

486
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:20,120
please give me a five-star review.

487
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:21,040
Thanks.

488
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:43,800
Here is something.

489
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:44,720
Well,

490
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:46,840
My friend and I opened a restaurant.

491
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:48,000
Would you like to...

492
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,360
Sorry.

493
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:50,440
Platform regulations.

494
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:52,280
We are not allowed to cook in any restaurants.

495
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:53,600
Not cooking.

496
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Well, it is cooking.

497
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,640
But it's not like this.

498
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:58,880
I see what you mean.

499
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:01,640
I don't accept recruitment from any restaurant.

500
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:04,560
Thank you.

501
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:09,040
What do you...

502
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:20,720
Come on.

503
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:23,360
Way to go.

504
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:24,240
Have you ever met

505
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,080
a handsome guy in real life?

506
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:27,240
I...

507
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:29,200
I didn't know what to say.

508
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,360
I finally said two words,

509
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:31,760
and he left.

510
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:32,400
Of course.

511
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,720
No one will talk to you

512
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:34,640
if you keep being a nerd.

513
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,640
An opportunity is wasted.

514
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:37,280
I don't care.

515
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:38,320
Make another appointment.

516
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:39,520
And,

517
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:42,120
Why did you ask him to cook homely dishes?

518
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:43,600
Are you trying to save money for me?

519
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:45,880
We don't need him to 
cook homely dishes in our restaurant.

520
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:48,120
Can you test him with some difficult dishes?

521
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:48,800
OK. OK.

522
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,480
I'll make another appointment now.

523
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:51,200
I'm telling you,

524
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,880
if you can't make it,

525
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,280
I'll send you to a culinary school.

526
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:55,480
I mean it.

527
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:57,120
Bye-bye.

528
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:00,960
She is no good.

529
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,760
Total wuss.

530
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:19,440
Hello?

531
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:20,480
Hi.

532
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:21,520
I'm Zhao Hyeonan, the Chef.

533
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:22,840
Did you just place an order?

534
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:23,600
Hello.

535
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,080
Yeah.

536
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:27,480
I just saw that all the slots were booked.

537
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:28,600
One client canceled.

538
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,160
Great.

539
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:32,440
You cooked my lunch today.

540
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:37,320
What do you want this time?

541
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:41,480
Should I upload the menu to the platform?

542
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:42,560
Or,

543
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:43,920
Can I friend you on WeChat?

544
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:45,080
Please send it to the platform.

545
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:46,360
Do I prepare the ingredients?

546
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:47,680
Yeah.

547
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:49,600
OK.

548
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:50,160
See you.

549
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:52,000
See you later.

550
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:58,800
Appointment made.

551
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:00,400
Consider it done.

552
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:04,360
Hello?

553
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:05,720
Hello.

554
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:07,000
Get downstairs.

555
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:07,720
Let's have dinner.

556
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:09,920
It is not the weekend.

557
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:11,280
Why are you here?

558
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:12,640
I've got good news.

559
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:13,480
Let's have hot pot.

560
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:14,200
Hurry up.

561
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:15,600
Come upstairs.

562
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:16,560
I got something for dinner.

563
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:19,640
Come.

564
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:20,200
OK.

565
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:32,720
My work is done.

566
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:33,800
If you are satisfied,

567
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:35,080
please give me a five-star review.

568
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:36,200
Thanks.

569
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,120
May I ask why

570
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:42,120
you don't want to work in a restaurant?

571
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:45,480
I have worked in several restaurants before.

572
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:46,720
Didn't end up well.

573
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:48,560
These owners only wanted to

574
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:50,600
make quick money

575
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:52,040
and maximize profits.

576
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:53,600
They didn't treat us chefs as equal humans.

577
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:56,400
Maybe in their mind,

578
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:57,560
chefs should just work hard

579
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:58,440
to earn the salary,

580
00:27:58,440 --> 00:27:59,320
and keep the mouth shut.

581
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:01,480
Of course,

582
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:02,760
it's not entirely their fault.

583
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:04,560
I stick closely to

584
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:06,040
my principles.

585
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:08,200
Sometimes,

586
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:10,920
I can be stubborn.

587
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:14,840
You're home.

588
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:20,480
This is...

589
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:21,480
This is Zhao Henan.

590
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:22,640
A chef.

591
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:23,840
This is my boyfriend.

592
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:26,240
Hello.

593
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:29,560
Then I'm leaving.

594
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:32,320
My friend asked me to do this.

595
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:34,000
Can you make time

596
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,560
to come to our restaurant?

597
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:37,320
You can meet my partner.

598
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:39,160
If you don't want to work with us,

599
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:41,360
at least you can give us some advice,

600
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:42,960
so I can report to my boss.

601
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:46,560
All right.

602
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:47,640
Contact me later.

603
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:48,360
OK.

604
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:49,480
Thanks.

605
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:52,080
Bye.

606
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:53,520
Goodbye.

607
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:57,400
See you.

608
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:04,960
What?

609
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:06,040
Wash your hands. Let's have dinner.

610
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:14,760
Why did you hire a cook for your home?

611
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:18,520
You Shanshan asked me to hire him.

612
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:19,400
She wants me to talk to him

613
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:21,280
while he is cooking here,

614
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:22,840
to see if he wants to work in our restaurant.

615
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:25,120
Why didn't she hire him at her house?

616
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:28,720
She never cooks in her house.

617
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:32,480
Feng Xi.

618
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:35,640
Are you telling the truth?

619
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:37,600
Can you eat

620
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,000
all the dished alone?

621
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:40,800
If I didn't come today,

622
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:42,960
would you two have a candlelight dinner right now?

623
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:45,640
What...

624
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:48,000
What are you talking about?

625
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:52,040
We've been together for ten years.

626
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:54,160
Can't I even have your trust on this?

627
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:58,400
Why are you mad?

628
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:00,480
The chefs I usually see

629
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,080
have big heads and thick necks.

630
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:03,760
Suddenly I see such a good-looking one

631
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,480
at my girlfriend's house.

632
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:05,920
What?

633
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:07,480
I can't even ask?

634
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:09,880
Let's just have dinner.

635
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:10,920
I have work to do.

636
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:31,840
Don't be upset.

637
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:33,960
I did this because I care about you.

638
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:47,920
He is good.

639
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:49,840
Have some of this.

640
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:55,040
Listen,

641
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:58,880
I have great news

642
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,640
for you today.

643
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:03,000
You know what?

644
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:06,920
I'm going to Germany.

645
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:13,320
This time we are going to Germany

646
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:15,760
to study as top talents.

647
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:18,240
They believe that the subject we are studying

648
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:19,900
will have a significant impact

649
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:21,800
on the global biological sciences.

650
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:25,080
I am now a postdoc.

651
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:26,440
When I come back,

652
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:28,560
I'll be at least a professor.

653
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:31,400
I'll have the status and the money.

654
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:32,720
Isn't it good?

655
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:34,480
I'm so happy thinking about it.

656
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:36,680
I'll be the first postdoc overseas returnee

657
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:38,400
in my hometown.

658
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:40,960
My parents will be so proud when I go back home.

659
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:43,200
No.

660
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:44,400
I can't go back.

661
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:46,880
They'll drink me under the table.

662
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:50,920
We'll have a welcome banquet for three days in a row.

663
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:53,880
I've decided that

664
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:55,400
I'll buy a new big house

665
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:56,760
for my parents.

666
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:59,360
And we'll keep the old one.

667
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:01,080
They can live wherever they want.

668
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:03,000
And my tutor.

669
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:05,240
He loves fishing.

670
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:08,200
I'll give him the two 
most expensive fishing rods as a gift.

671
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:10,480
I can never make it without him.

672
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:12,480
I have to return his favor.

673
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:13,560
Am I right?

674
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:15,360
And my cousin.

675
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:16,720
He always wants his child

676
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:18,160
to transfer to a school in Beijing.

677
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:20,060
I'll make it happen.

678
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:22,440
His child can live with me when he's in Beijing.

679
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:23,440
Piece of cake.

680
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:26,440
And my classmate, Jun.

681
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:27,320
You've met him.

682
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:29,480
What's his dream?

683
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:30,880
To be a driver.

684
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:32,800
That's kinda pathetic.

685
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:35,680
I'll try to get him to Beijing,

686
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:37,320
and he can be my chauffeur.

687
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:45,480
Look at me.

688
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:48,400
Am I a little bit cocky?

689
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:58,720
What about me?

690
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:04,320
What?

691
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:07,160
Is there me in your future.

692
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:37,320
I'll show you the kitchen.

693
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:46,480
This room is for washing dishes.

694
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:54,680
This room is for cold dishes.

695
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:33,840
Don't lose the notes I wrote to you.

696
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:35,080
They'll be useful.

697
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:36,520
Don't worry. We won't.

698
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:38,159
Are you sure you don't want to work here?

699
00:34:39,719 --> 00:34:41,159
Thank you for your trust.

700
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:42,800
Currently,

701
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:43,920
I don't have the plan

702
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:44,960
to work in a restaurant.

703
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,360
Sorry.

704
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:47,840
Don't be.

705
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:48,520
Like what you said,

706
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:49,600
currently not.

707
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:50,159
Contact us

708
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:51,480
whenever you change your mind.

709
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:54,040
You'll always be welcomed here.

710
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:54,920
Thanks.

711
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:57,960
Word of advice.

712
00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:00,080
Prepare the kitchen

713
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:01,080
as soon as possible.

714
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:02,560
Otherwise, it will hold back

715
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:03,560
your opening.

716
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:04,400
We'll keep that in mind.

717
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:05,320
OK. Goodbye.

718
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:15,200
There are people addicted to love or drama.

719
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:17,280
He is addicted to cooking.

720
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:18,360
He is more than a chef.

721
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:20,320
I think you are addicted to him.

722
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:21,680
Hurry up and find the next one.

723
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:45,920
I don't have to taste it.

724
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:47,440
If we cook for the construction site,

725
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:48,560
we can choose him.

726
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:08,920
This looks nice.

727
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:10,120
Listen to me.

728
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:11,160
The chef's face

729
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:13,080
looks at odds with our restaurant.

730
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:16,640
This one?

731
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:18,120
Isn't this too salty?

732
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:19,000
Yeah.

733
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:21,240
Try this plate.

734
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:23,640
Nope.

735
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:26,800
I'll throw up if I have one more bite.

736
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:28,960
Have we tried ten?

737
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,080
At least.

738
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:31,480
Twelve.

739
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:34,040
These chefs should be experienced,

740
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:36,440
right?

741
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:38,080
Yeah.

742
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:39,360
They make good dishes.

743
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:41,080
But I can't remember any of them after I ate it.

744
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:43,400
That guy looks so greasy.

745
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:46,440
He is totally inconsistent with
 the aesthetics of our restaurant.

746
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:47,600
I think you two

747
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:49,840
are too into that Zhao Henan.

748
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:51,840
You can' forget about him.

749
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:54,840
I'm not that shallow.

750
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:56,240
But I have to say,

751
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:58,520
it's really hard to find

752
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,120
a chef who cooks delicious food

753
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:03,040
and is a treat for the eyes.

754
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:06,600
What should we do now?

755
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:07,960
Keep looking.

756
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:13,040
This box

757
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:14,800
is your winter clothes.

758
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:18,040
This box is all your summer clothes.

759
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:20,560
These sauces

760
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:22,480
are familiar flavors from your hometown.

761
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:23,000
I got it.

762
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,520
This bag has

763
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:25,600
commonly used medicine.

764
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:26,840
I've labeled them for you.

765
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:27,760
Don't take the wrong ones.

766
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:30,600
I major in biology.

767
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:31,800
I won't take the wrong medicine.

768
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:33,520
This bag is for toiletries.

769
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:34,200
Don't fuss.

770
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:35,000
Come and hug me.

771
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:35,640
Come on.

772
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:36,560
And this.

773
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:37,880
A steam iron.

774
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:40,070
Remember to iron your suits and shirts

775
00:37:40,070 --> 00:37:40,880
when I'm away.

776
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:42,400
I don't want people
 to laugh at your crumpled clothes.

777
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:43,320
OK.

778
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:45,280
This is

779
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:46,760
a German adapter.

780
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:47,920
And,

781
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:49,080
warm socks.

782
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:50,280
Gloves.

783
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:53,280
I also bought you a pair of warm shoes.

784
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:55,400
I'm going to Germany,

785
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:56,520
not the Arctic.

786
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,560
New down jacket.

787
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:00,520
Try it on.

788
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:02,360
I'm good.

789
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:03,160
No need.

790
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:04,480
I know it'll fit.

791
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:06,520
Try it on for me.

792
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:07,320
No. No.

793
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:08,880
I want to look.

794
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:13,440
I'd say,

795
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:14,720
you should just

796
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:16,280
pack yourself in the box.

797
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:18,000
When I miss you,

798
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,400
I don't need to find a substitute.

799
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:22,760
This is the first time

800
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:24,960
you travel without me.

801
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:26,680
How can I not worry?

802
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:30,120
You drink a lot of hot water there.

803
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:31,280
Eat fruits.

804
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:33,560
Fruits are rich in vitamins.

805
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:34,640
OK?

806
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:36,960
If you really love me,

807
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:39,120
let me enjoy my

808
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:41,680
my hometown meal

809
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:42,800
tonight.

810
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:44,080
What?

811
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:46,960
It's dinner time!
