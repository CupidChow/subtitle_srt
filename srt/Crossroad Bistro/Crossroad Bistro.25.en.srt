4
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,920
I remember during my first year in Norway,

5
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,200
it was so cold one day.

6
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:08,800
So I was just craving dumplings.

7
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:09,960
There were only two Chinese restaurants

8
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:13,040
within five kilometers of where I lived.

9
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:14,440
One was a hot pot restaurant.

10
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,240
The other was Cantonese.

11
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:18,320
So,

12
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:19,560
which one did you choose?

13
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,000
I chose a Michelin 3-star restaurant

14
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,240
in downtown Oslo which was 30 km away.

15
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,680
Because it was
the only restaurant that served dumplings.

16
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:28,840
You wanted dumplings that much?

17
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,120
Of course.

18
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,880
I just had to have it at that moment.

19
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,480
And I didn't have a car at that time.

20
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:37,160
So it took me one and a half hours to get there.

21
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,040
You know what?

22
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:39,720
They sold out?

23
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,480
No, it was even worse.

24
00:02:42,079 --> 00:02:43,160
I looked at their menu.

25
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,320
They had dumplings indeed.

26
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,680
And one of the chefs

27
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,240
had worked in Shanghai for a year.

28
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,640
But, you know,

29
00:02:50,079 --> 00:02:53,000
they make dumplings quite differently in the south.

30
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,840
The fillings are sweet.

31
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,240
The dumplings there were so expensive.

32
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:58,200
It was 15 euros for one serving

33
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,200
and there were only three.

34
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,240
Did you have dumplings at last?

35
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,080
Of course.

36
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,360
I thought since I was already here,

37
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,320
why not?

38
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,240
I ordered one serving after another,

39
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,520
so they kept making dumplings.

40
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,160
In the end,

41
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:12,000
I had thirty-six dumplings.

42
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,560
Thirty-six?

43
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,240
Mm.

44
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:16,760
That's 180 euros.

45
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:20,400
That's why it was worse than them selling out.

46
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,680
That day, I spent all my money.

47
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,440
I didn't even have any left to go home.

48
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,400
Thank god, Shen Peihong

49
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,320
called a taxi and picked me up.

50
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:29,800
Who is Shen Peihong?

51
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:31,360
My roommate

52
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,880
and Yu Songyang's ex-girlfriend.

53
00:03:35,079 --> 00:03:37,000
So you've known Yu Songyang since then?

54
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:38,440
Yes.

55
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:43,280
Don't mention Shen Peihong in front of Bao Xue.

56
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,560
I know my sister well.

57
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,720
She'll be jealous.

58
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:46,760
If you don't mention it,

59
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:47,720
I won't.

60
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:49,440
Dai Xiaoyu.

61
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:51,560
Mr. Chai?

62
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,600
Xiaoyu,

63
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:53,560
you had an accident

64
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,760
and you didn't even tell me.

65
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:58,200
I just don't want you to be worried.

66
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,440
I'm all right now.

67
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:00,360
I can go home tomorrow.

68
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,440
Don't be ridiculous.

69
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:01,960
Look at you.

70
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:04,560
I can't even bear to see you like this.

71
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,080
Let me introduce you two.

72
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,880
This is my friend, Liu Liangzhou.

73
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:08,440
This is Mr. Chai.

74
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,080
I'm Chai Yong.

75
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:09,600
Nice to meet you, Mr. Chai.

76
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,440
Nice to meet you.

77
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,200
Shanshan only told me about you yesterday.

78
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,760
I feel so embarrassed.

79
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,160
May I talk to you alone?

80
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,120
I'll wait for you over there.

81
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:22,960
When we are finished,

82
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,600
I'll send her back to her room,

83
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:25,600
all right?

84
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,040
OK.

85
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:26,560
All right then.

86
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,160
See you later.

87
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,400
He seems to like you a lot.

88
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,480
He's so kind.

89
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,200
He even gave me his blood when I was in operation.

90
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:44,880
Have you thanked him?

91
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,040
Mm.

92
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,680
I'll treat him to dinner sometime.

93
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,280
Do you have anything to say to me?

94
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,120
Shanshan

95
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,680
only told me about this yesterday.

96
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,400
To be honest,

97
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,520
I couldn't sleep last night.

98
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:58,920
I'm your supervisor

99
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,560
in the workplace.

100
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,960
But outside of work,

101
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,160
I always see you as my little sister.

102
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:06,920
So I came here today

103
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,000
to give you some advice.

104
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,200
Whether you like it or not,

105
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:11,880
it's for your own good.

106
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,240
Why are you beating around the bush?

107
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:16,520
Just say it.

108
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,680
I've been doing business for many years.

109
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,440
Whether it's my clients or staff,

110
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,720
I see everyone as my friend.

111
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:24,360
So,

112
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:25,920
apart from work,

113
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:27,880
they often come to me for help

114
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:29,160
or advice.

115
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,320
Tell you what,

116
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,680
I once introduced a divorce attorney to my client

117
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,040
to help with a divorce case.

118
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:34,800
Do you believe it?

119
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:39,080
But I never interfere with anyone's decisions.

120
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,120
However,

121
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:43,440
as to this matter,

122
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:46,120
whether as your boss or as a friend,

123
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,960
I want to tell you something serious.

124
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,840
Stay away from that man.

125
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:54,280
Don't hesitate a single bit.

126
00:05:56,159 --> 00:05:57,440
Don't worry.

127
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,040
I never hesitated.

128
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,280
Pestering isn't love.

129
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:05,400
He is just being selfish
and wants to have you all to himself.

130
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,880
What happened, happened.

131
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,440
There's no point in blaming anyone.

132
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,520
But in this world,

133
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:13,600
there must be someone out there

134
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:15,920
who is willing to accept you as you.

135
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:17,360
Therefore,

136
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,680
he will love you without holding back

137
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,560
and you will love him the same way.

138
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:25,360
If you live every day with all your heart

139
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:27,760
and believe that there is someone like this,

140
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,200
he will appear sooner or later.

141
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,640
Why are you laughing?

142
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,200
I've never heard you

143
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:38,520
talking about this so seriously before.

144
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:40,480
It's so weird.

145
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:42,800
I never gave someone life advice like a brother.

146
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:43,640
This is my first time

147
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,480
and Dai Xiaoyu laughed.

148
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,000
Then, tell me,

149
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,640
is your wife the one?

150
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,840
I'm sure

151
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,760
that she thinks I am the one.

152
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,360
Xiaoyu, you are so smart.

153
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,240
You know what I'm talking about.

154
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,320
But I have to say it out loud.

155
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:10,400
This is my responsibility as a friend.

156
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:11,520
You just

157
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,920
take care of yourself.

158
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,040
Don't worry

159
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,680
about your job.

160
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,400
I'll always save the position for you.

161
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,120
Let me know if anything.

162
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,240
Thanks, Mr. Chai.

163
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,800
Uncle. Aunt.

164
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:26,600
You are here.

165
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:27,360
Mr. and Mrs. Dai.

166
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:29,640
Songyang.

167
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:31,600
Take a seat.

168
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,080
No, thanks.

169
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,320
I'll help with the packing.

170
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,400
You don't need to.

171
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:35,120
No problem.

172
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,360
You do the bathroom and I'll help them.

173
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:36,960
OK.

174
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:39,920
Aunt,

175
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,960
my sister texted me

176
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,240
that she can go home tomorrow.

177
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,080
Right.

178
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,159
The doctor examined her
and everything seemed all right.

179
00:07:46,159 --> 00:07:47,800
So she can go home now.

180
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:48,840
If that's the case,

181
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,159
it's best for her to rest at home.

182
00:07:50,159 --> 00:07:51,080
Where is she?

183
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:53,280
Liangzhou took her for a walk.

184
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,080
Who sent this?

185
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:00,160
Did Peng Pai come again?

186
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,080
He wouldn't dare.

187
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,640
It was sent by Xiaoyu's boss,

188
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:03,760
Mr. Chai.

189
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,320
Uncle,

190
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,360
did my sister tell you?

191
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:14,920
About what?

192
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:17,160
She wants to live at Granny's after she's discharged.

193
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,200
Yes, she did.

194
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,800
Actually, I've rented an apartment for her.

195
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:21,720
Liangzhou helped me choose the place.

196
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:23,240
But she insists on living at her grandma's.

197
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,720
She wouldn't listen to my advice.

198
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,160
Then I thought

199
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:27,440
it might be a good idea.

200
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:28,160
You know,

201
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:30,080
we can't keep accompanying her here,

202
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,160
right?

203
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:32,480
Xue,

204
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,120
your uncle and I haven't retired yet.

205
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,120
In order to come here,

206
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,559
we needed to ask for leave.

207
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:38,080
If she lives at her grandma's,

208
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,280
we won't have to worry about her.

209
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,280
At least,

210
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:42,000
she doesn't need to order in every day.

211
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:42,919
All right.

212
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:44,240
We'll let her decide.

213
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,960
Absolutely, Uncle. Just let her decide.

214
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,640
Let her live at Granny's if she wants.

215
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,320
I have no work to do today.

216
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,400
So I'll ask Songyang

217
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,880
to drive me to Granny's

218
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,920
so that I can get my sister's room ready.

219
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:57,120
Once you finish the paperwork at the hospital,

220
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:59,080
you can send my sister home right away.

221
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,120
Xue, how about this,

222
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,680
when you arrive tomorrow,

223
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,760
you go in first and tell her about it.

224
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:05,960
See how she takes it.

225
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,240
I'll wait outside.

226
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:08,360
Let me know if she's willing to see me.

227
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,920
No, Uncle.

228
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,360
If you are right at her door

229
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,560
and don't go in,

230
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,120
it will only make her angrier.

231
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,600
Darling,

232
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,640
what's most important is that Xiaoyu gets better soon.

233
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,360
Nothing else matters as much.

234
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,600
Xue is right.

235
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,040
All right.

236
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,240
That's what we'll do.

237
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,200
It seems that we're almost done.

238
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,600
Here. Careful.

239
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:50,600
Mr. Dai, allow me.

240
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,320
I'm OK.

241
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,280
Don't.

242
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:53,360
Let me try it myself.

243
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,360
Are you sure?

244
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:55,360
Careful.

245
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:01,720
It still hurts, doesn't it?

246
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:02,480
Of course.

247
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,920
The wound hasn't healed yet.

248
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,920
It's not only the wound. I ache all over.

249
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,160
Uncle. Aunt.

250
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:14,080
Sir, I'll do it.

251
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,040
Xiaoyu,

252
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,960
I'll stay here

253
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:29,240
while your family spend some time together.

254
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:31,840
Liangzhou,

255
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,320
thank you for the last couple of days.

256
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:35,400
Don't mention it. Have a good rest.

257
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,600
I'll come to see you later.

258
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,520
Mr. Dai, I'll wait for you here

259
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:40,840
and drive you to the airport.

260
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,080
I appreciate it.

261
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,360
No problem, Sir.

262
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:45,640
Thanks, Liangzhou.

263
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:46,680
See you later then.

264
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,000
Bye-bye.

265
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:49,400
Take it slow.

266
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:49,960
Mm.

267
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,080
Xue,

268
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,360
have you told your granny about it?

269
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:59,240
Don't worry. I already told her.

270
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:03,040
Anyway, I told her everything I know.

271
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,360
I didn't hide anything.

272
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:06,400
How did she take it?

273
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,720
She didn't say a word.

274
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:10,880
It was weird to me, too.

275
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,160
As I see it,

276
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:16,760
she was saving it for today.

277
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:24,440
Uncle,

278
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:26,320
don't worry too much.

279
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,800
Whatever she's going to say,

280
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:28,920
just accept it.

281
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,240
Also,

282
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:32,560
you can rest assured

283
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:34,840
that my sister will be taken good care of.

284
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,560
Granny loves her so much.

285
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:37,840
I know.

286
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:10,640
Mom,

287
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,680
I have to bother you this time.

288
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,600
She's my granddaughter.

289
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:27,760
What do you mean by "bother"?

290
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,240
Mom,

291
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:33,040
do you have

292
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:36,120
anything to say to us?

293
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:37,800
I know

294
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,280
that over these years…

295
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:41,120
I don't want to talk about it.

296
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:44,600
I just want to ask you one question.

297
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:45,200
Mom,

298
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:46,920
anything.

299
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,560
What happened to Xiaoyu is something big.

300
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:54,600
If Xiaoyu hadn't insisted on living here,

301
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,440
when would you tell me?

302
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,320
Mom,

303
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,440
we didn't mean to hide it from you.

304
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,240
We were afraid…

305
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:03,960
What,

306
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,760
you were afraid that if I went there,

307
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:07,280
I would cause trouble?

308
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:08,360
Mom,

309
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:10,960
why did you say something like that?

310
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:13,000
Given your age,

311
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:15,040
we were worried that if you got too emotional,

312
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,960
your health would be affected.

313
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,760
Thanks for your consideration.

314
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,480
At my age,

315
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:23,080
I've seen everything.

316
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,040
And you were worried that I couldn't take it?

317
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:26,680
Listen to me.

318
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:29,280
You're lucky that Xiaoyu is OK this time.

319
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:32,880
If anything had happened to her

320
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,480
and if I hadn't seen her for the last time,

321
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:38,040
I would hate you for the rest of my life.

322
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:38,880
Mom!

323
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Mom, it was our fault.

324
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,480
We didn't think it through.

325
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,760
And we lost our senses

326
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,880
seeing Xiaoyu like that.

327
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:49,600
Please don't be mad.

328
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:57,960
Where are you going?

329
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,240
I need a cigarette.

330
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:00,680
Just smoke right here.

331
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,720
You are my son.

332
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,200
Who says I don't allow you to smoke here?

333
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,000
If any neighbor sees you,

334
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:09,320
how will they think of me?

335
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:14,840
Use your father's ashtray.

336
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:16,920
Wash it after you use it.

337
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:34,600
Go home when you finish that cigarette.

338
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,800
You two haven't retired yet.

339
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,560
You still need to go to work.

340
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:39,240
Xiaoyu will live here.

341
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:42,040
If you're concerned,

342
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:46,160
go ahead and install a monitor in my house.

343
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:47,240
I won't mind.

344
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:48,040
Mom.

345
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:49,960
Why would we?

346
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,120
We have nothing to worry about

347
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:54,800
if Xiaoyu lives here.

348
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,480
Bear with me.

349
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,880
You are not young anymore.

350
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:04,040
Take care of yourselves.

351
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,760
If anything happens to either of you,

352
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:08,200
it will be a disaster for Xiaoyu.

353
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,840
Taking care of yourselves

354
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:14,680
is the best way to support her.

355
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:16,480
That's true.

356
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:17,720
Mom,

357
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:19,480
you're right.

358
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:20,760
Then,

359
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:22,680
shall we…

360
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:23,640
Go home.

361
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:30,360
Just go.

362
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,760
Take your father's ashtray

363
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,920
back with you.

364
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,920
I'll need it when I come again.

365
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,040
Mom.

366
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,040
I am sorry.

367
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:55,400
I shouldn't have upset you.

368
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:00,320
Mom.

369
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:03,640
Mom.

370
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:07,600
Mom.

371
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:13,920
Mom.

372
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:15,080
Mom.

373
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,040
I like this one.

374
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,440
Have this one blown up for me.

375
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:39,280
You should wear more clothes.

376
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:40,240
Mm.

377
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,680
It's getting cold.

378
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:44,520
You were so pretty

379
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:48,160
when you were young, Mom.

380
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:52,600
I'm even prettier now.

381
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:57,720
Mr. Dai,

382
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:59,280
which terminal is your flight?

383
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:00,160
It's Terminal 2.

384
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:00,840
OK.

385
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:02,240
Liangzhou,

386
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:05,160
we've bothered you a lot in the last few days.

387
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,640
I'm sorry if we have interrupted your work.

388
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:08,760
That's all right, Mrs. Dai.

389
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:09,720
I've been on a break.

390
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:11,040
I have a business trip next week.

391
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,119
Liangzhou,

392
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,640
as a photographer,

393
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:15,760
are you often away on business for a long time?

394
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:17,440
Not necessarily.

395
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:18,680
I may be away for months

396
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:21,160
or several days in some cases.

397
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,119
Liangzhou is a photographer.

398
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,440
Great.

399
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:28,640
Xiaoyu loves having her pictures taken.

400
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,640
You can take her pictures more often.

401
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:32,320
Liangzhou makes films.

402
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:33,120
I do everything.

403
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,960
I took Xiaoyu's pictures previously.

404
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:35,480
How about this,

405
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:37,280
next time you come to Beijing,

406
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,080
I'll invite you to my studio

407
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:39,280
and show you her pictures.

408
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,200
That's great.

409
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:43,120
Liangzhou,

410
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,440
I have something to say.

411
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:47,600
I hope you don't mind.

412
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,720
Anything, Mr. Dai.

413
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,080
We both know

414
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,640
that you are good to Xiaoyu.

415
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:55,040
My wife and I

416
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:56,520
both like you.

417
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:58,320
Xiaoyu also likes you.

418
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:00,360
She talks to you about everything.

419
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,080
What I'm saying

420
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:03,840
is that

421
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,760
after we leave Beijing,

422
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,520
could you spend more time with her?

423
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:10,400
Don't worry, Sir.

424
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:12,560
I'll spend more time with her.

425
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,920
But sometimes,

426
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:17,640
she can be headstrong.

427
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:19,200
Please don't blame her.

428
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:21,160
I can be headstrong, too.

429
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,280
Don't you remember?

430
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:24,280
Xiaoyu and I were born on the same day.

431
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,960
And we have the same blood type and zodiac sign.

432
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:28,440
So we understand each other very well.

433
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,520
Glad to hear it.

434
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:33,600
Just think twice before you make any decision.

435
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:36,280
Both of you
have to take responsibility for what you do.

436
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,360
But don't worry.

437
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,200
My wife and I

438
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,120
won't interfere with anything.

439
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:44,520
I know, Sir.

440
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:49,000
If you come to Hangzhou for business someday,

441
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,040
just come to see me.

442
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,680
We're happy to have you anytime.

443
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:53,640
Make sure you come.

444
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:55,560
OK, I will.

445
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:00,040
It's not long after Xiaoyu had the operation.

446
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,880
What do you think is good for her?

447
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:06,320
You can buy something rich in collagen.

448
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,160
But she doesn't like pig trotters.

449
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:10,080
Apart from pig trotters,

450
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,840
there are many things rich in collagen.

451
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:13,440
Tell me one.

452
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,880
Except for stimulating food, such as fish,

453
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:17,680
you see,

454
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:19,680
there are beef tendon, tremella,

455
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,520
chicken feet,

456
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:23,160
and soy products.

457
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:24,520
I see.

458
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:26,960
I'll stew the chicken feet with soy sauce.

459
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:28,480
And then,

460
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:30,240
I'll make sauce-fried tendon,

461
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:32,840
meatball soup with bok choy and tofu,

462
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:36,120
and tremella lotus seed soup.

463
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,280
What do you think?

464
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:39,720
Mrs. Bai,

465
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:41,880
even if you make these all at once,

466
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:43,800
Xiaoyu can't take in all the nutrients.

467
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:45,120
As I see it,

468
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,000
you don't need to make too much

469
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:49,080
for the three of you.

470
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:51,440
You can cook the same materials
in different ways from time to time

471
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,200
so that the kids won't get tired of the same dishes.

472
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:54,720
No,

473
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,080
it's just enough for the four of us.

474
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:58,480
I'm not going to join you today.

475
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,040
Why not?

476
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,400
Are you too shy to go?

477
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,240
You must come.

478
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,600
Today is my grandson's birthday.

479
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,280
My son invited us to dinner at a restaurant.

480
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:08,200
I'll go as soon as

481
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,400
you've bought everything you need.

482
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:12,240
So you're going to have a big meal.

483
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:15,360
Sister, these are your summer clothes, right?

484
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:16,920
Then I'm not taking them out.

485
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,400
Your closet is almost full.

486
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:19,040
Mm.

487
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,120
Don't you have work today?

488
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,040
Yes.

489
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:26,000
But the shooting is in the evening.

490
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:28,120
I'll go to the set after dinner.

491
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:33,400
Bao Xue,

492
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:36,440
I want to ask you a question.

493
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:38,520
You must answer me immediately.

494
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:43,000
All right.

495
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:44,400
Go ahead.

496
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:49,040
During the days in hospital,

497
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:52,160
Liu Liangzhou not only gave me his blood,

498
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:54,200
but also took care of me meticulously.

499
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:57,120
I know he loves me.

500
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:59,200
Do you think I'm a bad person

501
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,880
if I don't accept him?

502
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:01,560
Yes.

503
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:03,240
But,

504
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:07,120
gratitude is different from love.

505
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:09,840
You have to think carefully.

506
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:13,240
Do you want to marry the one you love

507
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,640
or the one you owe?

508
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,640
On the other hand,

509
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:22,280
a marriage resulting from gratitude

510
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:23,600
is not necessarily a bad one,

511
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:24,200
right?

512
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:27,280
This is where I struggle.

513
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:38,440
Ms. Hua?

514
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:40,840
The Ms. Hua in show business?

515
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:41,480
Mm.

516
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:45,040
Hello, Ms. Hua.

517
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:50,640
I'm fine.

518
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:52,560
I'm already home.

519
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:57,080
Thanks for asking.

520
00:21:58,120 --> 00:21:59,200
I'm all right.

521
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:05,920
Of course. I'll tell her.

522
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:10,080
All right then.

523
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:11,640
Thank you, Ms. Hua.

524
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:13,000
Bye-bye.

525
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,920
What's up?

526
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:20,240
You finally made it.

527
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,280
What do you mean?

528
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:26,120
A new director is going to make a movie.

529
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:29,360
Ms. Hua recommended you as the leading actress.

530
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:31,840
Are you serious?

531
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,720
I'm going to play the first leading role

532
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:40,800
in my life.

533
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:43,640
Listen.

534
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:45,120
You must do it right.

535
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,560
Don't embarrass me.

536
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:48,800
Don't worry.

537
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:51,040
I promise not to disappoint you.

538
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,600
Thanks, Sister.

539
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:57,120
Are you OK?

540
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:58,200
I'm so sorry.

541
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,240
What great news!

542
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,320
I'm so happy.

543
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:04,280
Thanks.

544
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:16,080
I didn't prepare any gifts for your grandson.

545
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:17,880
This is a small gesture of mine.

546
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:19,960
Mrs. Bai, I can't take it.

547
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:21,120
I insist.

548
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:22,560
Nowadays,

549
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:24,560
young people send red packets via smartphones.

550
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,320
Let's do it the old way.

551
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:28,880
It's nothing much. Only my best wishes.

552
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:31,000
You have to take it.

553
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:34,240
Don't embarrass me in front of so many people.

554
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:36,920
Just take it.

555
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:39,240
Let's go.

556
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:40,680
All right. I'll take it.

557
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:46,840
Grandma,

558
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:48,320
why don't you have any?

559
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:49,400
I've had a lot.

560
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:56,240
Granny, have some soup.

561
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:58,240
Just help yourselves.

562
00:23:58,640 --> 00:23:59,680
I'll have it later.

563
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:11,320
Here, eat more.

564
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:15,160
Grandma.

565
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:16,160
Granny.

566
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:17,400
Why are you crying?

567
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:20,680
I'm OK. I'll fully recover soon.

568
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:22,840
Every child in our family

569
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:26,600
is so kind and smart.

570
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,200
Why did something bad happen to you?

571
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:40,640
It's just painful to see you like this.

572
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:42,720
My kid.

573
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,120
That's all right, Grandma.

574
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:53,520
Granny.

575
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:00,400
Please stop crying, Granny.

576
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:10,520
Have more.

577
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:12,800
You, too.

578
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:19,280
Granny, don't cry.

579
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:47,600
One. Two. Three.

580
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:23,440
Have you arrived in Beijing?

581
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:27,120
We just arrived, Mom.

582
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:30,280
Feng Xi, take care of yourselves.

583
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:31,440
Don't make me worry about you.

584
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,160
OK, Mom.

585
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:36,120
I know, Mom.

586
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:40,120
It's our first time in Hubei.

587
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:41,640
We want to travel around here.

588
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:42,440
Don't worry.

589
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:44,000
The four of us are together.

590
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:47,280
OK, Mom.

591
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,160
Bao Xue.

592
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:52,840
Hello.

593
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:54,240
Why are you so early after a night of shooting?

594
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:55,040
I have some business to deal with.

595
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:55,600
See you.

596
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:56,440
Bye-bye.

597
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:05,120
Come to the restaurant at six tonight.

598
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:07,280
Please turn down any other invitations.

599
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:08,400
Everyone must be there.

600
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:15,560
Everyone must be there.

601
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:25,240
Everyone must be there.

602
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,640
You don't need to notify me.

603
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:29,600
I go to the restaurant every day because of you.

604
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:52,040
What's Feng Xi up to?

605
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:53,640
I've no idea.

606
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:55,560
Why is she being mysterious?

607
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,800
I'm so bored.

608
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:00,880
I want to join you.

609
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,920
I can walk on my own now.

610
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:04,400
Will Granny allow you to go out?

611
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:06,240
Probably.

612
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:07,400
I won't drink.

613
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:08,400
Of course, you won't.

614
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:09,960
Even if you want to,

615
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,160
no one dares to give you any.

616
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:13,640
I miss you all.

617
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:15,640
So I'll tell Grandma that I'm going

618
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:17,560
and I will be back early.

619
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:19,200
How about this?

620
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:21,960
Just ask Liangzhou to pick you up.

621
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:23,640
Ask him to join us today.

622
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:25,600
He will be on a business trip soon, right?

623
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:27,280
OK.

624
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:29,000
Have you arrived at Ms. Hua's company?

625
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:30,800
I'm almost there.

626
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:31,680
Maybe two minutes away.

627
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:33,120
Tell me when you're done.

628
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:34,360
OK.

629
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:36,560
Bye-bye.

630
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:25,760
I was scared to death.

631
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:28,040
You wanted to scare me first.

632
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:29,760
But it was too obvious.

633
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:32,280
I have to do it again.

634
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:33,280
Fine. Go ahead.

635
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:42,160
Oh my god.

636
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,840
Are you kidding me?

637
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:45,840
You suck at acting.

638
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:53,320
Why were you acting mysteriously?

639
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:54,920
What on earth did you ask me to come for?

640
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,360
Listen.

641
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:58,080
I have two pieces of news.

642
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:59,240
I'll hear the good one.

643
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:01,040
Let me finish.

644
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:03,720
I have two pieces of good news.

645
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:04,480
Nope.

646
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:06,040
I have three pieces of good news.

647
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:07,840
Which one would you like to hear first?

648
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:09,320
How do I choose?

649
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:12,200
Just pick one.

650
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:13,080
The second one.

651
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:15,240
So the second one is

652
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:17,560
that Ms. Dai, the one who is in recovery,

653
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:18,840
and who is my sister,

654
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:20,160
got a boyfriend

655
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:21,400
at 11 p.m. yesterday

656
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:24,240
officially.

657
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:25,600
Liu Liangzhou?

658
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:28,120
How smart you are!

659
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:29,200
Who else can it be?

660
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:31,000
They are quite a good match.

661
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:32,440
And Liu Liangzhou is quite adorable.

662
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:33,560
That's right.

663
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:35,400
It's not news as it's nothing unexpected.

664
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:37,280
Choose your next one.

665
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:37,920
The third one.

666
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:40,800
The third one is

667
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:42,720
that Feng Xi sent us a message

668
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,360
to invite everyone to dinner tonight.

669
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:46,560
Even though I don't know why yet.

670
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:48,040
But my instinct tells me

671
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:50,400
that it must be something good.

672
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:51,360
Does this even count as good news?

673
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:52,440
Of course.

674
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:53,760
Fine.

675
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:55,080
The first one.

676
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:58,000
You finally asked about the first one.

677
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:01,840
Do you know who Ms. Hua is?

678
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:03,400
I remember you mentioned it.

679
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:04,400
Isn't she an agent?

680
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:05,320
No.

681
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:08,040
She's not just any agent.

682
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:11,160
She is a top, unbeatable, super agent.

683
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:12,720
She signed a contract with you?

684
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:14,800
This is her company.

685
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,680
I just came out from there.

686
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:18,600
I feel that Ms. Hua is a really kind person.

687
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:20,600
She even sent someone to pick me up

688
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:23,160
from the hotel I stayed in.

689
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:24,280
In a tractor?

690
00:32:25,290 --> 00:32:28,520
♫I am a mischievous kid♫

691
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:27,040
It's Buick GL8.

692
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:29,280
Much better than a tractor.

693
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:32,240
♫Laughing and Enjoying myself♫

694
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:30,200
Seriously,

695
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:30,960
there is an arthouse film

696
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:33,040
that she wanted me to take an audition for.

697
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:36,490
♫My dreams are within my reach ♫

698
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:34,840
I wish you had seen it back there.

699
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:37,400
The whole audition

700
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:39,560
just went so smoothly.

701
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:42,320
♫All those big talks that I don't understand♫

702
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:40,680
I beat everyone else

703
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:41,520
effortlessly

704
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:42,600
and got the leading role.

705
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:44,040
It's basically settled down.

706
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:45,390
♫They have nothing to do with me♫

707
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:45,560
They already started the law approval process.

708
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:49,580
♫Don't be afraid of the thunderstorm♫

709
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,080
Look.

710
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:49,760
They already gave me the script.

711
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,200
Once I finish this film,

712
00:32:51,490 --> 00:32:56,350
♫We are who we are♫

713
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:54,160
I will officially become

714
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:56,800
an actress at Ms. Hua's company.

715
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:58,560
This is some good news indeed.

716
00:32:58,310 --> 00:33:01,170
♫We're there for each other in laughter and tears♫

717
00:32:58,560 --> 00:32:59,360
You must invite me to dinner.

718
00:32:59,360 --> 00:32:59,960
Right?

719
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:01,200
What about you pay for it?

720
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:04,040
♫We are by each other's side♫

721
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:04,000
Didn't you say that Feng Xi invited us tonight?

722
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:07,500
♫We will stay together♫

723
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:07,320
But I want to have ice cream now.

724
00:33:08,190 --> 00:33:11,810
♫And fight till the end of time♫

725
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:09,520
All right.

726
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:10,760
Easy-peasy.

727
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:13,160
Let's go.

728
00:33:12,890 --> 00:33:16,900
♫Little did we know that in front of life♫

729
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:15,920
I'm going to order a large size.

730
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:17,000
We must celebrate it.

731
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:18,600
And I'll sing a song for you.

732
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:19,560
Great.

733
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:24,240
♫We don't stand a chance♫

734
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,600
I'll get back to work tomorrow.

735
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:33,560
You can rest now.

736
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:36,640
All right, you two.

737
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,720
You asked for one week's leave

738
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:40,280
to get married, huh?

739
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:46,320
Tell me the truth.

740
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:47,680
Did you

741
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:49,600
seduce your female supervisor?

742
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:50,440
Or did you

743
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,160
take advantage of your position

744
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:54,360
to seduce the most talented employee?

745
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:55,080
Tell me.

746
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:57,200
This should be called

747
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,640
a perfect combination
between core management and a top employee,

748
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:00,360
all right?

749
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:02,280
Jesus.

750
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:03,120
Don't you think

751
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:05,120
that this is something worth celebrating?

752
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:06,240
Absolutely.

753
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:08,520
I'm so impressed.

754
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:09,440
Take a seat.

755
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:10,639
My goodness.

756
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:12,600
You guys are too quick.

757
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:17,000
Everyone.

758
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:17,840
The first toast

759
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:19,960
is to the new couple.

760
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:21,920
Thanks, Shanshan.

761
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:22,960
Till death do you apart.

762
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:23,600
Thanks.

763
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:24,880
Congratulations!

764
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:26,159
Thanks.

765
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:30,440
Why did I sound like the MC?

766
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:31,560
Because you are.

767
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:32,520
The second toast

768
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:35,280
is to Xiaoyu.

769
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:37,480
Thank god you're safe and sound.

770
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:38,960
Safe and sound?

771
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:39,960
What do you mean?

772
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:40,679
Everyone,

773
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:42,199
let's drink to Xiaoyu.

774
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:43,360
Cheers.

775
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:44,280
Thanks.

776
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:49,239
Xiaoyu, what happened?

777
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:51,639
Why did I know nothing?

778
00:34:52,199 --> 00:34:54,040
Xi, I'll tell you later.

779
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:55,719
I'd like

780
00:34:55,719 --> 00:34:57,040
to take this opportunity

781
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:58,160
to make a toast

782
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:00,200
to Liangzhou.

783
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:02,120
Take it slow.

784
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:02,600
Stand up.

785
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:03,680
She can drink much more than you do.

786
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,320
Where did that come from?

787
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:07,240
Don't worry.

788
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:08,640
I'm so happy right now.

789
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:10,040
Liangzhou,

790
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:11,800
thank you.

791
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:14,840
All right. Shall we start?

792
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:15,560
Of course.

793
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:16,400
Let's start.

794
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:17,080
Fill that up.

795
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:18,280
Ding, here's to you.

796
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:19,400
Good.

797
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:33,400
It seems that

798
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:34,840
you haven't drunk enough at dinner.

799
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:36,440
I only had a little.

800
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:38,280
Looking at the three couples,

801
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:40,320
I felt like I was the extra one.

802
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:41,800
So I found an excuse to leave.

803
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,480
Now that each of your friends

804
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:46,000
has found somebody,

805
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:48,200
you should be happy for them.

806
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:50,760
Do I look unhappy?

807
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:52,480
You come here

808
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:53,880
either when you're not happy

809
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:55,480
or

810
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:57,320
when you are stressed out.

811
00:35:58,640 --> 00:35:59,840
That's why

812
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:02,240
your place is like a temple for me.

813
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,920
But I came for something else.

814
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:09,200
Long asked you to speak to me, right?

815
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:12,000
I know he already talked to you,

816
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:12,640
right?

817
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,440
He came to see me

818
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:16,920
and asked me to convince you
to get back to your old business.

819
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:19,880
I've been happy with my little workshop

820
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:21,080
over the years.

821
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,520
I don't think I want to change anything.

822
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:25,840
Anyway, I came.

823
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:30,480
I didn't come to convince you,

824
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:32,240
but to make him give up.

825
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:34,280
You know me well.

826
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:41,200
On the other hand,

827
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:45,280
I would love to see you again

828
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:47,560
on stage playing the drums.

829
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:57,120
Hello?

830
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:59,120
Xiaodong.

831
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:00,920
That's right.

832
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:02,640
Let's talk face to face.

833
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:03,280
All right.

834
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:05,240
See you tomorrow.

835
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:06,880
See you.

836
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:08,200
Which Xiaodong?

837
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:09,160
The one working at the hospital?

838
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:10,160
Yes.

839
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:11,080
That's him.

840
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:12,800
Are you all right?

841
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:13,760
I'm fine.

842
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:15,280
We're seeing each other tomorrow just to talk.

843
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:16,120
Really?

844
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:16,920
I'm fine, really.

845
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:18,160
Grab the Hang.

846
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:19,440
Let's play some music.

847
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:21,680
It's been so long since our last time.

848
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:01,040
I pause and you continue.

849
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:11,080
One. Two. Three. Go.
