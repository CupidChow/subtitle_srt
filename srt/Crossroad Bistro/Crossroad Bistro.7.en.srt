[Ep07]

4
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:01,120
These are

5
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:03,240
some of the designs I've done in recent years.

6
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,760
Our design plan this time is mainly about

7
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:08,120
the combination of tradition and modernity.

8
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,479
This is my previous design

9
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:11,720
themed by space and time.

10
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:14,640
It's full of plagiarisms.

11
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:18,160
How is it going?

12
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:21,240
Not well.

13
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:22,840
I have met five people

14
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:24,000
in the past two days.

15
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,720
None is qualified.

16
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:26,520
Too expensive?

17
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,040
It's not about money.

18
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,160
Their designs are all so tacky

19
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,240
and expensive as hell.

20
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:36,000
In such matters,

21
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
my idea is

22
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,880
to first recognize their design philosophy,

23
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,920
and spend as little as possible.

24
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:41,600
Am I right?

25
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:42,400
Huh?

26
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:43,280
Yeah.

27
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,440
Xiaoyu.

28
00:02:54,079 --> 00:02:54,880
Didn’t you say that

29
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:57,040
you know someone who does interior design?

30
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,160
Did you find him?

31
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,280
He replied to me that

32
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,360
he is on a case right now.

33
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:05,920
There is no conflict. He can take this job.

34
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:08,160
He is very professional.

35
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,960
He must finish the case before taking the next one.

36
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,560
Unlike some designers,

37
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:14,280
who take the order anyway

38
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,760
just for the money.

39
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,240
The way you describe him

40
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:20,200
really interests me.

41
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,200
How did you two meet?

42
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,920
He was my roommate’s boyfriend

43
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,440
when I was studying in Norway.

44
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,079
He came back to China after graduation.

45
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,160
Where's your roommate?

46
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,600
She's still in Norway.

47
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,120
Did they break up?

48
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,000
Yeah.

49
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,280
I have to meet this guy.

50
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:42,320
Set up a meeting.

51
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:43,840
Got it.

52
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,240
Shanshan.

53
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,760
Why are you giving me a gift again?

54
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,320
My friends, a couple,

55
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:07,040
rented a greenhouse in the suburbs.

56
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,560
These are the strawberries they grow.

57
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,280
No pesticides are used.

58
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:11,720
They gave me two boxes.

59
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:12,520
I can't eat that many.

60
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,760
So I want to give you some.

61
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,040
Come whenever you like.

62
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,399
But don't bring anything next time.

63
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:17,160
OK?

64
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,360
Of course not.

65
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:19,800
Is tea okay?

66
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:20,279
Sure.

67
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:21,760
Are you writing?

68
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:22,440
Yeah.

69
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,040
Whenever I can.

70
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:25,560
Do you

71
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,040
do this every day?

72
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:28,400
Ummm...

73
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:30,280
You won't have time to write

74
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:31,400
when the kid comes home, right?

75
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,760
I can have a longer time

76
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,200
when my child and husband are asleep.

77
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:37,240
Can you live like that every day?

78
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,200
What can I do?

79
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,240
Be careful. It's hot.

80
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,360
Is it okay

81
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,800
for your husband to sleep alone

82
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,159
every day?

83
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47,280
Haven't you heard that?

84
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,360
The standard configuration

85
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,400
of a mature and stable family,

86
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,240
is a perfect gentleman

87
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,320
and a woman who can't be turned on.

88
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,040
People talk about the seven-year itch.

89
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,120
We have been married for almost nine years.

90
00:04:58,159 --> 00:04:59,640
We would feel awkward

91
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:00,800
holding hands on a whim.

92
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,360
Well.

93
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,680
Everything about your married life

94
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:07,920
is new to me,

95
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,920
as if I had never been married.

96
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,520
When did you start being like this?

97
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:14,930
From the moment you went to the toilet
 with the door open,

98
00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:17,040
and he came in calmly and shaved in front of the mirror,

99
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,280
your love has been sublimated.

100
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,280
Are you two

101
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,360
not in love anymore?

102
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,520
We are good friends,

103
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:25,520
so don't break my heart,

104
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:26,160
OK?

105
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:26,800
OK.

106
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:31,360
I have evolved from a passionate wife

107
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,640
to an indifferent middle-aged woman.

108
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,240
My husband takes half of the credit,

109
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,680
and my child takes another half.

110
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:37,760
You have a child too.

111
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:38,880
You don't need me to tell you that.

112
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:39,560
Um.

113
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,520
The husband who enters marriage

114
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,840
will degenerate into a name very soon.

115
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,320
For seven days a week,

116
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:47,000
he has to work for five days.

117
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,240
Because of his business,

118
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,120
he has to socialize from time to time.

119
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,920
Even if he’s at home on weekends,

120
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:54,080
he’s not really at home.

121
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,760
Before the advent of social media,

122
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,800
he used to lie on the sofa watching videos.

123
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,160
He first watched the full set of Discovery.

124
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,440
From volcanic eruption

125
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:03,840
to gorilla growth.

126
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,160
Later he started watching

127
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,440
war documentaries.

128
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,920
From the World War I

129
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,320
to the Libyan War.

130
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,160
After having a smartphone,

131
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,560
he started to play games and scroll down Twitter.

132
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:15,160
He has no time to communicate with me

133
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:17,560
on the emotional level.

134
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,680
Enough about me.

135
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,080
Why did you come here?

136
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,840
Just to deliver strawberries?

137
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:29,520
I

138
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,600
am here to bring you medicine.

139
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:34,440
What medicine?

140
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,480
The medicine for your complaint.

141
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,240
Let's come straight to the point.

142
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,600
I want to open a restaurant.

143
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,200
It's already open, to be precise.

144
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:44,480
I want to get you in.

145
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,400
300,000 RMB.

146
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,560
10% of the shares.

147
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,240
In or out?

148
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:51,520
Huh? Huh? Huh?

149
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,800
Is that the only word you can say?

150
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,360
This is a bit sudden.

151
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,720
What event in life didn't happen suddenly?

152
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,320
Now this restaurant,

153
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:01,760
including me,

154
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:02,880
has four shareholders.

155
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,040
You can be the fifth.

156
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:06,160
Consider it a nice distraction,

157
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:08,480
so you don’t have to 
face your husband and child every day

158
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:10,240
and enter menopause early.

159
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,040
But this is huge,

160
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,760
I need to discuss this with my husband.

161
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:25,760
Look at you.

162
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:26,800
All right.

163
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,280
Take your time.

164
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,600
I'll keep this position for you anyway.

165
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,680
I'm busy. Gotta go.

166
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:31,320
Tell me

167
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:32,520
when you make up your mind.

168
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:33,000
OK.

169
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,440
You are leaving now?

170
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:34,960
Yeah.

171
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,080
Not stay for dinner?

172
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:36,680
Nope.

173
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:38,120
OK.

174
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,000
Take care.

175
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:39,600
Bye-bye.

176
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:51,480
Sorry.

177
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,080
It's so hard to drive in the alleys.

178
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:53,520
Come on.

179
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:54,240
Hop on.

180
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:57,600
Long time no see.

181
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:59,240
Why don't you stay in Norway

182
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,320
but come back to Beijing?

183
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:01,280
I'm back for you.

184
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,000
Cut it out.

185
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,240
Buckle up.

186
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,200
How long it's been since we last met?

187
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,120
About five or six years?

188
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:26,240
Why haven't you changed a bit?

189
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:27,920
You haven't, either.

190
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,320
Have you finished your case?

191
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,240
Almost finished.

192
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:36,960
That's great.

193
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:48,400
How do you feel?

194
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:49,880
The layout is not bad.

195
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,240
Then what do you say?

196
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:52,680
Some time ago,

197
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:54,320
I just finished designing a theme restaurant.

198
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:55,560
I can show you my work.

199
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:56,960
If you are interested in

200
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,440
our design philosophy,

201
00:08:58,560 --> 00:08:59,400
we can talk about it.

202
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:00,760
Let's do it now.

203
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,200
Follow me.

204
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:05,920
OK.

205
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,160
Do you think it'll work?

206
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:10,080
Good first impression.

207
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,240
But I don't know about his capacity.

208
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,340
Let's take a look at his works.

209
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:13,720
Follow that yellow car.

210
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,440
When designing this restaurant,

211
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:20,480
I used the concept of space folding.

212
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,280
I restructured the arch elements

213
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:24,440
in classical architecture,

214
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,840
and incorporated them 
into contemporary aesthetics.

215
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,600
I want to blur the boundary

216
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,840
between the wall and the roof.

217
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,340
So I winded the wall

218
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,160
and extended it into the ceiling.

219
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,000
I used a tailor-like technique

220
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:37,360
to attach the copper material

221
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,680
to the curved surface.

222
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:40,400
For the key vision,

223
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:42,200
I used glass with western classical colors,

224
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:45,280
so as to bring a surreal experience to the diners

225
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,440
I used silk noodles for the table cloth.

226
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:50,680
Its reflection

227
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:53,160
echoes the color of copper.

228
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,840
Do you also design the tablecloth?

229
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:56,560
Of course.

230
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:57,720
Including tableware.

231
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,800
If you just eat to fill your stomachs,

232
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,120
then why do you decorate?

233
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,520
Splashing water to sweep the floor,

234
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,160
setting up a few tables and chairs

235
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,200
like hole-in-the-wall places.

236
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:10,400
Do you want that kind of restaurant?

237
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:12,320
Then you don’t need to

238
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,320
spend the money to hire a designer.

239
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,080
In my opinion,

240
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:20,120
Restaurants are not only to fill our stomachs,

241
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:21,840
but also to socialize.

242
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,760
An all-rounded design,

243
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,280
including details,

244
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:27,040
as long as it is related to aesthetics,

245
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:27,800
I'll be in charge.

246
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,280
What do you think?

247
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:32,280
I think it's so cool.

248
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:33,480
Beautiful.

249
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:35,280
See?

250
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:37,800
This space echoes your aesthetics.

251
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,400
But I think...

252
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,760
Here...

253
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:44,600
You think it's bad?

254
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,440
No. No.

255
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,920
It's terrific.

256
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,720
But...

257
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:49,920
It's okay, just tell me.

258
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,560
How much is the average cost here?

259
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:53,200
500 RMB.

260
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:55,320
That's awkward.

261
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:57,520
500 RMB is not too much,

262
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:59,400
but ordinary people can’t afford it.

263
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,480
Isn't it kind of light luxury?

264
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:01,760
And also.

265
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:02,760
Look.

266
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:03,720
These places

267
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,120
can obviously be used to set up tables,

268
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,480
but you placed decorations instead.

269
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,280
This virtually limits the number of diners

270
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:09,320
and reduces the turnover.

271
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,240
You are right.

272
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,870
I want to ask you that

273
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:19,920
would you come here to eat?

274
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:23,400
I'm afraid not.

275
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:25,560
Let's put it this way.

276
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:26,800
If I want to entertain

277
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,200
important clients,

278
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,240
I will choose a more magnificent place,

279
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,640
because that kind of banquet does not have a budget.

280
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,040
But if I have a gathering with friends,

281
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,560
I won’t consider the decoration.

282
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:36,560
I would only focus on

283
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:37,680
how good the food is.

284
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:43,720
Sorry.

285
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:44,640
We are not professional.

286
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:45,680
Please don't mind.

287
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:47,640
Whatever a client says,

288
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,360
it's not about being professional or not.

289
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:50,960
It's about their needs.

290
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:52,680
To be frank,

291
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:54,280
it's about what kind of people

292
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,560
are their target customers.

293
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,040
In other words,

294
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:02,000
If this restaurant were near the embassy district,

295
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,920
I wouldn’t feel so strange.

296
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,520
But here,

297
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:07,800
I feel awkward.

298
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:08,760
The surrounding area

299
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:10,280
is full of hole-in-the-wall restaurants

300
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:12,120
like hot pot and barbecue.

301
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,320
Among them,

302
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,960
this place is either

303
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,200
a triton of the minnows,

304
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,680
or a pain in the ass.

305
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:21,120
We have considered everything you said.

306
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,280
There are two reasons why I am satisfied with this work.

307
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:25,160
First, the design philosophy

308
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:26,560
is highly completed.

309
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:27,920
And second,

310
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,880
it is in full compliance 
with the client’s requirements.

311
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:31,520
We have to present

312
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:32,800
what the client needs.

313
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:34,200
It can be said that

314
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,240
clients and designers

315
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,160
hit it off.

316
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,120
So,

317
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,920
you will also listen to the opinions of

318
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,520
non-professionals like us at work.

319
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:42,240
Of course.

320
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:44,560
If you don’t follow the boss’s will,

321
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,160
you’ll be exhausted and make no money.

322
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:51,160
Designers are indeed working with art,

323
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:52,240
but first,

324
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,400
we are in the service industry.

325
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:54,920
Great.

326
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:56,800
I appreciate your attitude towards work.

327
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:58,920
Give us a design plan.

328
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:00,440
Sure.

329
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,160
Do you want a pain in the ass,

330
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:04,440
or a hole-in-the-wall one?

331
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:07,560
The shareholders of this restaurant

332
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:08,840
are all women.

333
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:10,480
Be romantic.

334
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:15,040
OK.

335
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:17,200
Romantic it is.

336
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:31,800
Mrs. Bai.

337
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:32,960
What would you like today?

338
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,520
A bowl of beef noodles is fine.

339
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:36,040
OK.

340
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:37,920
Mrs. Bai.

341
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,480
I didn't see you this morning.

342
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,480
I went to other places this morning,

343
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:44,360
so I didn't go to the park.

344
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,080
I see you don't want to cook, too.

345
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:49,000
I can eat here

346
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,840
three or four times a week.

347
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,000
That's not good.

348
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,600
One or two meals out are ok.

349
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,760
It’s bad for your stomach

350
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:56,040
to eat out all the time.

351
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:57,040
I am used to it.

352
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:00,080
Your wife doesn't like to cook?

353
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,760
My wife died.

354
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:02,520
Five years ago.

355
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:05,720
Sorry to hear that.

356
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,040
You have some too.

357
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:10,200
My husband passed away ten years ago.

358
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:13,680
I'm so hungry.

359
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,760
The older you are,

360
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,800
the faster time passes.

361
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:20,880
Tell me about it.

362
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:22,680
Since retiring,

363
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:24,640
I found that

364
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:27,240
I get up in the morning,

365
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:29,240
and blink my eyes,

366
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,520
and it's dark already.

367
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,920
It's like someone is driving me with a whip.

368
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,400
In the past,

369
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:38,120
I felt that death was

370
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,280
far away from me.

371
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,480
But it's getting closer now.

372
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,320
You have nowhere to hide.

373
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,080
Now, I only hope that

374
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,040
when my day comes,

375
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,560
it'll be fast.

376
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:53,480
The last thing I want

377
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,320
is to make my children suffer with me.

378
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:57,040
Old people

379
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,240
all think so.

380
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:58,960
But,

381
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:00,240
you have to be impossibly lucky

382
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,440
to not suffer at all.

383
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:06,680
What did you do for a living before retiring?

384
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:08,760
Radio station.

385
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,400
Music editor.

386
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:11,600
No wonder.

387
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,000
Your voice is nice.

388
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:14,600
Professional.

389
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,480
Besides handwriting,

390
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,360
what do you usually do in your spare time?

391
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,360
I...

392
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:23,360
read books

393
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:24,560
and play chess.

394
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,280
I play mahjong twice a week.

395
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:28,360
I like to sing,

396
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,760
play the piano,

397
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:30,720
and do some sports.

398
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:32,840
That's nice.

399
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,480
Where do you play mahjong?

400
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,400
In my house.

401
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:37,200
Do you know how to play?

402
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,040
No.

403
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:39,240
Come to my house.

404
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,080
I can teach you.

405
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,760
Playing mahjong can
 strengthen your hands and brain,

406
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:44,440
and prevent Alzheimer's disease.

407
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:45,880
Here, friend me on WeChat.

408
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,440
Mrs. Bai, you are so fashionable.

409
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:49,560
I do have the WeChat app.

410
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:50,240
But,

411
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,960
I don't know how to friend people.

412
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:52,800
I'll teach you.

413
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:54,880
I also play poker

414
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:55,880
online.

415
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:57,160
Here, let me see.

416
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:58,720
Find your Wechat.

417
00:15:58,720 --> 00:15:59,720
There it is.

418
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:10,080
[Shen Peihong]

419
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:14,920
What?

420
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,840
Can't I call you for no reason?

421
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:18,880
Staying up late to work again?

422
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:21,720
Thank you for your concern.

423
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,440
Where have you been lately?

424
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,960
Nowhere.

425
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:25,960
Not in the mood.

426
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:27,480
Not in the mood?

427
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:28,760
Didn't you say that

428
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:31,000
it’s not heavy to carry a mountain on your back?

429
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,720
I said curtain, not mountain.

430
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:35,960
Babe, I'm going to the coffee shop.

431
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:37,720
You need anything?

432
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:39,240
No, I'm ok.

433
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,240
He didn't sound like Chinese.

434
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:43,560
Babe,

435
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:44,280
come here.

436
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:46,360
Come.

437
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:50,080
This is Olaf.

438
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:55,520
You really don't need anything?

439
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:56,240
No.

440
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:57,600
OK.

441
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:01,960
Public display of affection at night?

442
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:03,960
At night?

443
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,280
Here

444
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:07,560
is the afternoon.

445
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:09,119
OK.

446
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,720
I'm happy to see

447
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:11,960
you are so happy.

448
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:14,960
Are you still single?

449
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:18,680
The shepherd has to graze the sheep for a year

450
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:20,319
and let the grass grow for a year.

451
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:21,560
Why so hurry?

452
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:22,839
Didn’t you say that

453
00:17:22,839 --> 00:17:24,800
you want to live the life of a shepherd?

454
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:25,960
Sunbathing every day

455
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,440
and don’t have to think about anything.

456
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:28,800
That's my dream.

457
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:31,320
Is there a lot of work in China now?

458
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:32,920
Not bad for this year.

459
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:36,360
Some blew me off but came back to me again.

460
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:39,280
Do you remember

461
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,440
the girl who shared the apartment with you before?

462
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:44,000
Dai Xiaoyu.

463
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:44,960
Yeah.

464
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:45,840
That's her.

465
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:48,400
She offered me a job placement.

466
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,000
I am negotiating with them now.

467
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:52,240
I'm looking for her.

468
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:54,960
Give me her contact information.

469
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,240
OK, I'll send it to you.

470
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:58,840
What job placement?

471
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:00,760
A restaurant

472
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,160
owned by a bunch of women.

473
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:07,360
My partner has been persuading me that

474
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,040
working for women is not a piece of cake.

475
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:11,480
I didn't agree.

476
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:13,400
But lately,

477
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:14,640
I've learned my lesson.

478
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,240
Your partner is right.

479
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,880
Working for women can be difficult.

480
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:19,920
But if you complete this job,

481
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:22,280
you'll be the number one designer in the industry.

482
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,840
You'll be able to handle both male and female clients.

483
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:26,560
Actually, I have some ideas

484
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:28,120
for the design of this restaurant.

485
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:30,560
I'm just flustered whenever
 I have to deal with female clients.

486
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:32,000
Don't be.

487
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,400
I believe you.

488
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:35,040
As long as it's not a romantic relationship,

489
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:36,920
you can get along well with anyone.

490
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:37,640
Go get them!

491
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:39,760
Are you trying to encourage me, Miss Shen?

492
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:42,080
Kind of.

493
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:44,360
Thank you.

494
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:27,600
What do you think?

495
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:33,360
Generally, I'm satisfied.

496
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:35,320
Do you have a quotation?

497
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:36,800
My job is to design.

498
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,320
You talk about money.

499
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:41,440
Ms. You.

500
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:42,120
Have a look, please.

501
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:50,080
That much?

502
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:55,280
Ms. You, we are not profiteers.

503
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:57,320
All prices are marked clearly.

504
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:59,160
You can ask the merchants.

505
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:06,960
I'll check it with you one by one.

506
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:08,040
No need.

507
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,960
I won’t understand even if you explain.

508
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,240
I stick to the price I quoted before,

509
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:12,440
we can sign the contract if you can do it.

510
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:13,480
If not,

511
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:14,400
I'll find someone else.

512
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:20,840
Ms. You.

513
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:22,480
How about

514
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:23,360
you raise your offer a bit,

515
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,320
and we cut down the price

516
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:26,600
a little,

517
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,800
then we can make a deal.

518
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,880
It is really difficult for us

519
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,720
to accept your quotation.

520
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:43,600
Mr. Gu.

521
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:45,960
It's business we are talking about here.

522
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:48,200
I can't put you in a difficult situation,

523
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,160
can I?

524
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:50,880
It's okay.

525
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:52,400
You think about it.

526
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,920
Feel free to contact me.

527
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:55,760
I should go.

528
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:59,080
Take care.

529
00:20:59,080 --> 00:20:59,600
OK.

530
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:07,480
What a businesswoman.

531
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:11,040
I told you to be moderate,

532
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,200
but you have to raise the price.

533
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:21,920
If you ask me,

534
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,480
we should forget about this job.

535
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,120
Reasons?

536
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:30,640
Bro.

537
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:34,000
It's just for your own good.

538
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:35,720
First,

539
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:37,280
we can barely profit

540
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:38,960
from that offer.

541
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:40,720
Second,

542
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,360
negotiating with women

543
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:43,720
is time-consuming, laborious,

544
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:45,400
and particularly difficult.

545
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,360
One woman is fine,

546
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:47,520
but you are dealing with many,

547
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:48,720
that's a mess.

548
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:51,520
If they change their mind by day,

549
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:53,360
you'll wish you didn't accept this job.

550
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:00,440
I am

551
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:01,720
several years older than you.

552
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:04,480
I have more experience than you 
in dealing with society and women.

553
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:06,160
Remember.

554
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:07,720
Unless you have to,

555
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:10,600
don't get involved with women who have money,

556
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:12,240
leisure, and friends.

557
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:15,640
You were hurt by more women than me.

558
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:16,640
I'll trust you on that.

559
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:20,200
I'm telling you,

560
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:22,480
the layout of their restaurant is unique.

561
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:23,760
If they don’t use this design draft.

562
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,040
I don't think others will use it.

563
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:29,120
If you really decide to let go,

564
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,840
I say you give them this draft

565
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:32,400
and let them construct it by themselves.

566
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,680
No.

567
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:41,040
Take a chill pill.

568
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:41,720
Calm down.

569
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:44,120
You can't just give it away.

570
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:48,320
OK.

571
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:50,320
There is a profit after all.

572
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,120
We'll take this job.

573
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:56,560
What a businessman.

574
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:04,160
Did you hear from Yu Songyang?

575
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,200
No.

576
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,280
Ask him.

577
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:09,440
Ask what?

578
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:11,920
If he doesn't reply, then the game is over.

579
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:15,800
Why did you do that?

580
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:18,120
If you like the plan, you should make the deal.

581
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,160
Thanks to your bargaining,

582
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:21,600
now we don't have a designer.

583
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:24,480
Why didn't any designer

584
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:25,960
I've met want to take this job?

585
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:27,720
What's the problem?

586
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:28,960
You.

587
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:32,360
Can you blame me?

588
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:33,760
Negotiations

589
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,680
are about moves and countermoves.

590
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,000
I didn't expect them to surrender

591
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,120
in the first round.

592
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:44,280
No, ask him, Xiaoyu.

593
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:46,080
Why don't you ask?

594
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:49,120
Whoever asks first is in the passive position.

595
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:49,960
You ask him.

596
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:51,120
But don't ask directly.

597
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:53,360
Just pretend you don't care.

598
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:55,000
Beat around the bush.

599
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,480
Give yourself a break.

600
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,120
Drama queen.

601
00:23:58,360 --> 00:23:59,560
What do you know?

602
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:02,680
Ask him now.

603
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:07,160
Bao Xue should do this.

604
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:08,520
She is professional.

605
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,600
Don't text. Call him.

606
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:20,840
Hello?

607
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:22,440
Hello, Xiaoyu.

608
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:25,160
Could you ask Ms. You Shanshan

609
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:26,640
why she didn't answer the phone?

610
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,760
Mr. Gu has called several times.

611
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:30,760
I'll tell her.

612
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,680
I'm in a meeting. Gotta go.

613
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:35,720
OK.

614
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:37,040
What?

615
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:37,680
What did he say?

616
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,080
Shanshan.

617
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,800
Mr. Gu called you several times.

618
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:42,720
You didn't answer one.

619
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,480
No, he didn't.

620
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:46,520
Oh yes, he did.

621
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:48,920
But look at this number.

622
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,200
It is obviously chosen randomly.

623
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:51,600
I thought it was from

624
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:52,840
an MLM organization.

625
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:54,520
Call him back now.

626
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:55,720
He said yes.

627
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,240
Great!

628
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:02,200
See?

629
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,720
My way worked!

630
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:04,600
You both should learn.

631
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:06,280
Especially you, Dai Xiaoyu. Shut up.

632
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:22,600
Coming.

633
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:31,080
Mrs. Bai.

634
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:32,840
Welcome.

635
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:33,560
Come on in.

636
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:36,600
Do I need to change to slippers?

637
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:37,480
No need.

638
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:38,480
OK.

639
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:41,120
I got it.

640
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:42,960
You can watch us play mahjong.

641
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:43,840
No problem.

642
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:45,760
That's what I'm here for.

643
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:47,040
You sit here,

644
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:48,520
and watch us play for a while.

645
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,320
After I win this game,

646
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:51,640
I'll make you tea.

647
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:53,080
Sit here.

648
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:57,560
How should we call you?

649
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:58,440
I'm Lu.

650
00:25:58,440 --> 00:25:59,120
L-U, Lu.

651
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:02,560
Where did you work before retiring?

652
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:03,680
Peking University Seventh Hospital.

653
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:06,480
A doctor!

654
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:07,960
What specialty?

655
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:08,960
Pediatrics.

656
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:10,280
Are you doing background research?

657
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:12,320
It's ok.

658
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:18,640
Your house is clean.

659
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,480
You made the house a warm,

660
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:21,880
cozy place to live.

661
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,240
I set a rule for myself.

662
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:28,800
Things that will not be used in one year,

663
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:31,280
and clothes that won't be worn in two years,

664
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:32,760
will be disposed of.

665
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:35,440
I give them away if anyone wants them.

666
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:36,200
If not,

667
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:37,600
I‘ll sell them

668
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:38,480
as waste recovery.

669
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:42,040
Are your children in Beijing?

670
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:44,880
They are all married.

671
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:47,440
One is in the south of the city 
and the other in the north.

672
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,920
They visit me on holidays.

673
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:51,400
We make phone calls

674
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,640
if needed.

675
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:55,720
You should hang out more often.

676
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,040
People our age

677
00:26:58,040 --> 00:26:59,520
can't stay at home all the time.

678
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,480
You should be more socially active.

679
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:03,840
Otherwise,

680
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:04,840
you will grow old fast.

681
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:07,040
You are so outspoken.

682
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:08,720
Good attitude towards life.

683
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:16,840
I'm here. Where are you?

684
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:18,040
I'm on the terrace outside.

685
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,040
Through the door, I'm on your right.

686
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:31,480
Sit.

687
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:36,680
Thank you

688
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:38,240
for coming to see me.

689
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:40,080
Don't be a stranger.

690
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:41,480
I'm here just to tell you

691
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:43,240
that Xiaoyu now lives in Beijing.

692
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:44,720
She invested in a restaurant.

693
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:46,320
Invested in a restaurant?

694
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:48,840
Doesn't sound like her.

695
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:50,560
It's true.

696
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:52,160
That restaurant is called...

697
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:53,200
Crossbow...

698
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:53,800
No.

699
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:54,640
It's...

700
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,680
Crossroad Bistro.

701
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:59,480
My ex, an interior designer,

702
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:01,000
is decorating the restaurant now.

703
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,640
He gave me Xiaoyu's phone number.

704
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:06,040
Give me her number, please.

705
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:07,040
And,

706
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:08,640
do you know where the restaurant is?

707
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:11,080
I didn't ask about it.

708
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:14,280
Could you please

709
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:15,480
ask for me?

710
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,160
Don't tell them it's for me.

711
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:19,920
Are you guys

712
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:21,520
OK?

713
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:27,760
I didn't handle some things very well.

714
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,040
Xiaoyu was mad at me,

715
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,040
so she left.

716
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:34,760
She hasn't changed her temper.

717
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:39,440
You two have been together for a long time.

718
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:40,640
You should get married.

719
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:41,280
Yeah.

720
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:42,480
I think so too.

721
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:44,760
Plus,

722
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:46,720
Xiaoyu's birthday is coming soon.

723
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,440
I want to go back and surprise her.

724
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:52,400
And we can discuss the wedding.

725
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,120
OK.

726
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:55,880
I'll ask it for you.

727
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:56,760
I will tell you when I know.

728
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:58,240
Thank you so much.

729
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:01,160
I'm talking about the overall effect.

730
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:02,920
But we have to calculate the cost.

731
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:04,600
Will the overall effect appear out of nowhere?

732
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:05,000
No.

733
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,680
It is piled up with our money.

734
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:08,080
They are all stated in this plan.

735
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:09,360
I did not make additional requirements.

736
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:09,720
So?

737
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:12,080
Then you can do it according to the plan.

738
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:14,320
I don't understand why we are arguing.

739
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:15,120
I mean,

740
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,280
can you unite your opinions?

741
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:19,000
I met three out of four shareholders.

742
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,760
Everyone has their own idea and changes it by day.

743
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:22,160
Everyone wants to be the boss.

744
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:23,480
What should I do?

745
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:25,600
Their thoughts are just fine-tunings.

746
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:26,440
A hundred fine-tunings

747
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:28,480
are equivalent to overturning the plan 
and doing it again.

748
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:31,240
OK, I know what you mean.

749
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:33,160
Well then, just listen to me.

750
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:33,840
But your problem is,

751
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:35,320
you often give up what shouldn’t be given up

752
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:36,840
and insist on what shouldn’t be insisted on.

753
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:40,360
I don't know what to say.

754
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:41,920
What do you say?

755
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:44,520
Stop that.

756
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:45,160
Excuse me.

757
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:45,680
Sorry.

758
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:46,960
Stop.

759
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:49,440
We should set some ground rules.

760
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:50,560
First,

761
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:52,600
you can provide constructive opinions

762
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:54,320
after thinking thoroughly.

763
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:54,800
Second,

764
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:55,560
decisions

765
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:57,440
cannot be changed after twelve hours.

766
00:29:58,120 --> 00:29:58,880
Third,

767
00:29:58,880 --> 00:29:59,880
I have the final decision

768
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:01,120
on whether to adopt your opinions.

769
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:03,080
But if you...

770
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:04,200
Think thoroughly.

771
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:07,360
I have only one question.

772
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:08,840
If I listen to you,

773
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:10,240
who will be responsible for overspending?

774
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:11,240
As long as you don’t make changes,

775
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:12,600
it won't be over budget under my watch.

776
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:13,400
OK, you'll be the boss.

777
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:14,920
Any overspending will be 
deducted from your balance.

778
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:16,000
Do you accept that?

779
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:18,160
If you do, then fine by me.

780
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:21,880
I have never seen someone like you.

781
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:24,960
OK.

782
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:26,640
People,

783
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:27,840
let's keep working.

784
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:28,880
We're in a hurry.

785
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:30,920
Let's see the materials.

786
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:31,920
No, I'm not going.

787
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:32,640
It's your call.

788
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:33,280
Wow, chinoiserie.

789
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:34,560
Very attentive.

790
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:36,280
He has all the light boxes ready for us.

791
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:43,720
[Crossroad Bistro]

792
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,000
Beautiful.

793
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:42,000
Let's go in and have a look.

794
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:55,640
Welcome.

795
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:00,800
What?

796
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:02,440
Anything wrong?

797
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:05,280
I can't find a word to praise you.

798
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:06,880
You startled me.

799
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:10,160
What do you think?

800
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:13,000
Flashy.

801
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:14,480
It's raunchy...

802
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:15,040
It's romantic.

803
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:17,760
Storming an iron-wall pass.

804
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:19,000
Starting the long march from now.

805
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,400
Are you posting chicken soup for the soul again?

806
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:21,760
Wonderful.

807
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:23,520
I divided the yard

808
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:25,080
behind the front hall into two spaces.

809
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:27,960
One side is the indoor garden,

810
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:29,440
and the other is private rooms.

811
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,480
The lighting of the indoor garden

812
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:34,920
makes customers feel like spring all year round.

813
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:36,360
If you think

814
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:37,760
it's a waste of space,

815
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:39,840
you can move all these plants out.

816
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:41,720
As long as you don’t find it ugly,

817
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:43,360
you can put them on the table.

818
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:48,120
There are movable partitions in private rooms.

819
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:51,800
Customers' needs for large space

820
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:53,760
or privacy can be met.

821
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,600
This wall took me a long time.

822
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:02,240
You can’t afford to hang expensive paintings,

823
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:04,280
but I think it’s too ugly to hang cheap ones.

824
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:05,520
So I chose

825
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:07,080
a lot of mirrors for decoration.

826
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:08,760
It doesn't cost much,

827
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:10,800
and it's tasteful.

828
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,200
The fishes

829
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:17,440
are a gift from me.

830
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:19,080
I hope your restaurant

831
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:20,040
runs as smoothly as a fish swims.

832
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:23,200
Isn't your name Yu Songyang?

833
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:25,360
You should give us some sheep.

834
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:27,160
Why fishes?

835
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:29,040
You picky women.

836
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:31,400
My work is done here.

837
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:32,480
Perfect.

838
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:34,880
I'll settle the balance for you in a while.

839
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:36,640
You are the first client

840
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,280
who's not late in paying the balance.

841
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:38,960
Any friends of yours

842
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,640
can enjoy 30% off in this restaurant for life.

843
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:41,520
Thanks.

844
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:43,240
Can the 30% discount be used as payment to you?

845
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:43,800
Knock it off.

846
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:46,240
Sly.

847
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:49,560
Aren't there four shareholders?

848
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:51,400
Who is the fourth one?

849
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:53,800
The fourth shareholder is my cousin.

850
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:55,080
She is filming out of town.

851
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:56,800
A celebrity?

852
00:33:58,080 --> 00:33:59,560
That'll be good.

853
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:00,320
She is an extra.

854
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:06,600
Does You Shanshan pick on her as she does with you?

855
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:09,239
Of course.

856
00:34:09,239 --> 00:34:11,159
But my cousin has a glib tongue,

857
00:34:11,159 --> 00:34:12,480
so Shanshan can't outspeak her.

858
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:14,639
But we are only joking.

859
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:15,719
No one will get mad.

860
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:18,760
You don't have problems with Shanshan, do you?

861
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:20,880
Why do you ask that?

862
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:22,679
I see you two arguing a lot.

863
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,040
I don't want you to take it wrong.

864
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:26,679
You Shanshan is

865
00:34:26,679 --> 00:34:28,320
quite straightforward,

866
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:29,760
and sometimes a bit mean.

867
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:32,040
But she is awesome.

868
00:34:33,639 --> 00:34:34,719
Running a company,

869
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:35,600
investing in stocks,

870
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:36,719
and now opening a restaurant.

871
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:39,120
I think she must be a very strong person.

872
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:42,280
No woman is strong on every side.

873
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:44,560
She must have a soft side too.

874
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:46,440
It's just that she won't show it to you.

875
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:50,360
You speak like you understand women.

876
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:51,920
Shen Peihong has told me about your

877
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:54,120
relationships a thousand times.

878
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:58,560
By the way,

879
00:34:58,560 --> 00:34:59,480
she asked

880
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:00,760
for your contact information

881
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:02,120
and your restaurant address a while ago.

882
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:04,200
What for?

883
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:05,360
I don't know.

884
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:06,360
I didn't ask.

885
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:07,960
Did you give it to her?

886
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:08,760
Yeah.

887
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:10,840
What?

888
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:14,880
Nothing.

889
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:26,920
That's correct.

890
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:28,080
Then I'm leaving.

891
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:29,080
Thank you.

892
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:31,200
Thanks.

893
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:33,720
So much stuff.

894
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:35,640
Where can we put them?

895
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:37,760
Cooks should be doing this.

896
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,280
They all have different habits.

897
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:40,160
They might feel not handy

898
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:41,240
if we arrange them.

899
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:42,040
Speaking of that.

900
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:43,920
Our chef quit at the last minute.

901
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:45,160
He stood us up.

902
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:47,520
Don't be too worried.

903
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:48,600
There's gotta be a way.

904
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:50,280
How can I not worry?

905
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:52,720
The restaurant is about to open, but the chef is gone.

906
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,120
You keep checking on

907
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:58,520
the online recruitment.

908
00:35:58,520 --> 00:35:59,920
I'll ask someone I know.

909
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:00,400
And,

910
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:02,040
ask Xiaoyu to find as well.

911
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:03,120
OK.

912
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:16,120
Good evening, everyone.

913
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:17,360
I am today's chef.

914
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:18,920
My name is Zhao Henan.

915
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:20,240
These are my assistants.

916
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:21,920
That's the end of my self-introduction.

917
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:23,120
This is a

918
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:24,960
deep-sea yellowfin tuna.

919
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:26,520
Its body-fat is

920
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:28,560
about 3% to 6%.

921
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:30,400
Later,

922
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:32,840
you can taste it by color.

923
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:35,000
The dark red part is Akami,

924
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,400
which is the part with the least fat.

925
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:39,120
Next is Chutoro.

926
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:40,840
The light red part is Otoro.

927
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:43,240
Now I will disassemble

928
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:45,760
this yellowfin tuna for everyone.

929
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:24,600
Today,

930
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:26,800
who is interested in trying the fisheyes?

931
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:28,160
Wait.

932
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:29,160
I’ll count down from three.

933
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:30,400
Raise your hands together, OK?

934
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:31,160
Three.

935
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:31,720
Two.

936
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:32,400
One.

937
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:33,640
I'll do it.

938
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:35,360
I said,

939
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:37,200
there are only two fisheyes today.

940
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:38,760
Gentlemen, put your hands down.

941
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:42,440
Ladies first.

942
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:43,360
I saw

943
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:45,520
this lady is the first to raise her hand.

944
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:46,680
You are the first lucky one.

945
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:47,840
You are the second.

946
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:49,360
Ma'am,

947
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:51,040
If you eat this fisheye today,

948
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:52,400
you will be twenty years old tomorrow.

949
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:53,440
I'm afraid the man next to you

950
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:54,680
will no longer recognize you.

951
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:56,280
Twenty years old,

952
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:57,320
really?

953
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:58,480
Well.

954
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:00,000
My duty here is fulfilled.

955
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,960
The banquet is about to begin.

956
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:03,600
Thank you all.

957
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:04,560
Thanks.

958
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:05,320
Goodbye.

959
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:11,160
What do you think?

960
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:12,960
I haven't tried it yet. How do I know?

961
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:15,960
I'm asking what you think of the chef.

962
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:18,480
Of course he's good.

963
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:21,080
Good-looking too. Awesome cutting skills.

964
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:23,640
But he's not suitable for our restaurant.

965
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:24,840
We don't serve Japanese food.

966
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:30,200
Guan,

967
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:33,720
Is the chef from your club?

968
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:34,520
Ms. You.

969
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:35,880
Don't flatter me.

970
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:37,880
How can my chefs do this?

971
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:39,560
He was recommended by a friend of mine.

972
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:40,440
I think

973
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:42,680
we found him on a network platform.

974
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,800
But I can tell you that

975
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,960
not only did they disassemble this big fish,

976
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:48,440
but make all the dishes

977
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:49,520
in this house.

978
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:51,320
He is good.

979
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:53,240
Indeed he is.

980
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:55,360
Which network platform is it?

981
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:56,520
Um...

982
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:58,000
I don't know.

983
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:00,240
Chef,

984
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:01,160
which platform are you from?

985
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:02,000
Hobby Kitchen.

986
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:03,880
Hobby Kitchen?

987
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:09,720
What?

988
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:10,800
Do you want him?

989
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:14,240
I will try it now.

990
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:23,120
Did you find him?

991
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:24,960
Nope, he was fast.

992
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:27,040
Download this app now.

993
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:28,440
Get me an appointment with Zhao Henan.

994
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,160
You can shelve the online recruitment for a while.

995
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:32,600
If he says yes,

996
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:34,560
we'll meet him at our restaurant.

997
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:35,480
We have everything in the kitchen.

998
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:36,200
Okay?

999
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,800
We can also talk about remuneration.

1000
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:40,320
Call me if you have any questions.

1001
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:42,200
It's been busy in the company,

1002
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:43,960
I can't worry about the restaurant all the time.

1003
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:44,520
Sure.

1004
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:46,600
But I can't guarantee you anything.

1005
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:47,920
You have to make it.

1006
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:51,640
You cannot fail on this one.

1007
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:52,960
If you fail,

1008
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:54,640
I will send you to a culinary school.

1009
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:57,240
You will learn from cutting and preparing food.

1010
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:00,600
I will study this app.
