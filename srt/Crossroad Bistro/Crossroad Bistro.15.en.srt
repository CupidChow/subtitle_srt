00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:02,040
She must be really scared.

5
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,960
I heard her shouting in the car from a distance.

6
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,320
When she sat next to me,

7
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:07,090
I couldn't even hear the engine.

8
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:07,800
If I didn't know,

9
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:09,360
I'd have thought you're killing someone.

10
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:12,000
Have a can of War Horse.

11
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:13,640
Get more energy.

12
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:14,480
Alright.

13
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,280
Thanks, Jun.

14

Yu Songyang.

15
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:20,440
I need to pick up my bag from your car.

16
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,680
I have to go back.

17
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,800
Stay for longer and have fun.

18
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,570
Excuse me.

19
00:02:23,570 --> 00:02:24,250
I've got stuff to do.

20
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:24,880
I'll be off.

21
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:25,579
See you next time.

22
00:02:25,579 --> 00:02:26,360
Bye-bye.

23
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,160
That's quick.

Xue.

25
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:31,360
What's the problem?

26
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:33,160
I'm gonna kill Dai Xiaoyu when I go back.

27
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,280
She made up with Peng Pai.

28
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:42,200
Would you feel that I'm a big loser?

29
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:44,600
No.

30
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:45,600
How do you live

31
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:46,480
and who do you live with

32
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,960
are totally up to you.

33
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:52,040
I know I let you down a lot.

34
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,680
I do think you should be better than this.

35
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,680
I was just thinking

36
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,560
that I'm 30 now.

37
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:04,800
I can't act on impulse anymore.

38
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,800
It's time I have a stable life.

39
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:08,720
Xiaoyu,

40
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,400
do you think that you might have

41
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,840
misunderstood the meaning of stability?

42
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,240
A life without worries

43
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,160
counts as stable, right?

44
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,920
Are you sure a life with someone like him

45
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,040
is without worries?

46
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:26,040
Never mind.

47
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,280
Let's not talk about this.

48
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,000
Tell me your plans for the next step.

49
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,240
I plan to go back

50
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:33,600
to Norway with him.

51
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:34,760
If so,

52
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:35,840
I can return your investment.

53
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,760
But I don't want that.

54
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:39,920
Do you want to kick me out?

55
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,079
The thing is,

56
00:03:43,079 --> 00:03:44,800
I prefer to make things clear.

57
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:45,880
We have been friends.

58
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:47,680
I won't kick anyone out without reason.

59
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,120
But you understand

60
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,960
that I bit your boyfriend's head off.

61
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,960
I'm afraid I won't be able to talk to him again.

62
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,640
Also, I do not wish to see him again.

63
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,520
If this continues,

64
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,240
it would be difficult

65
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:01,880
to keep being your friend.

66
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,560
I understand.

67
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,840
I don't want to go back to Norway any soon.

68
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,080
Also, I don't want to

69
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,320
quit the job Chai Yong gave me.

70
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:17,040
That's my career, after all.

71
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:19,880
Even if I marry him,

72
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:21,440
I won't be so dependent

73
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,560
on him like before.

74
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:27,680
I respect all your decisions.

75
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,440
If you're willing to keep cooperating,

76
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,520
I'm fine with that.

77
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:31,360
There is only one thing.

78
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:34,000
Never let him

79
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:34,880
come to this place again

80
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:37,480
in case he and I meet and both get embarrassed.

81
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,159
You're so calm.

82
00:04:41,159 --> 00:04:42,520
It scares me a bit.

83
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,920
I'd rather you scolded me.

84
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,560
Never mind.

85
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:50,880
I can't force you

86
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,280
to live the way I want you to live.

87
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,640
As long as you're happy, it's good.

88
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,440
I just don't want

89
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:57,400
to let this matter

90
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,360
affect our relationship.

91
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:01,560
My opinion remains the same.

92
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,120
We can still be partners.

93
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,920
But as friends,

94
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:06,880
our relationship will be difficult to stay the same.

95
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,640
Alright.

96
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:14,920
I'll be off.

97
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,600
Chai will host a dinner here tomorrow,

98
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,160
but I won't be able to come.

99
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,600
No problem. Tell Feng Xi about it.

100
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:22,880
OK.

101
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:31,440
Leave the private room to Mr. Chai tomorrow evening.

102
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:32,560
Sure.

103
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:35,640
Are you alright?

104
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:37,360
I'm fine.

105
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:38,640
How about you?

106
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,600
I'm good.

107
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,760
I'll get used to it soon.

108
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:45,840
I'll be off, then.

109
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,640
I have things to do tonight and won't be here.

110
00:05:50,159 --> 00:05:51,040
Don't worry.

111
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:08,120
How can I not worry when seeing you like this?

112
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,160
Have you contacted him in the past few days?

113
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:15,640
No.

114
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,080
Why do I feel Xiaoyu doesn't look right, either?

115
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,080
What's the matter with her?

116
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,080
You are the same.

117
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,920
Both of you keep me worrying.

118
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:36,360
Hello.

119
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,240
Hello, Dai.

120
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:39,080
When will you come today?

121
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,360
But didn't we agree that I'll take photos of you today?

122
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,040
Sorry.

123
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,520
I forgot about it.

124
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,240
Come here if you don't have things to do.

125
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,600
I'm alone today, anyways.

126
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,880
Come any time.

127
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,680
Alright. I'll go there.

128
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,720
But I can't take photos today.

129
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,320
I have something to tell you.

130
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:07,360
Alright.

131
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:14,080
Dai.

132
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,240
There's one thing that I'm actually

133
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,200
better at compared with him.

134
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,240
You're more decisive when it comes to me.

135
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,080
I really don't want to waste your time.

136
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,080
Have you ever liked me?

137
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,200
I admit

138
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:38,720
that I feel happier with you

139
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,600
than when I'm with him.

140
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:41,600
But...

141
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,560
But you feel that with me,

142
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,680
you don't feel safe.

143
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,640
I realized it the other day when we

144
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,360
bought the video camera.

145
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,280
Indeed,

146
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:55,960
I don't have much of a plan.

147
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:57,880
I spend more than I earn

148
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,160
and haven't managed to save much.

149
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,360
But I can feel I have a bright future.

150
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,280
I know.

151
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,440
But men and women are different.

152
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,400
I'm already 30 now.

153
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:11,960
So what?

154
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,680
Are you half-dead?

155
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,320
You're only 30

156
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:18,400
and you want to live a life like a 60-year-old.

157
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,920
Do you think that's a stable life?

158
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:22,840
Liu.

159
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:26,880
I'm sorry.

160
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,600
You don't need to feel sorry.

161
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:38,960
I like you

162
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,039
from the bottom of my heart.

163
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:42,280
You refuse me

164
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,760
from the bottom of your heart, too.

165
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:45,160
Cheers, Dai.

166
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:49,440
We can still be friends, right?

167
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:51,680
Of course,

168
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:53,600
as long as you want to.

169
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:55,520
I do.

170
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:57,640
Wish you happiness.

171
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:00,760
Wish you happiness, too.

172
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,880
I've felt bad enough today.

173
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,520
Even you scold me.

174
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,960
I know what I did is unfair to Liu Liangzhou.

175
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,800
But that's what I think.

176
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,000
I just want to have a stable life.

177
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,040
What's wrong with it?

178
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:19,440
Sis.

179
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,320
Don't get angry at me.

180
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,840
I don't want to educate you

181
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,920
or stop you from having a happy life.

182
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,440
I just feel it's not good enough for you.

183
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,520
I also feel Liu is wronged.

184
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:29,440
Alright?

185
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,000
I will be the one to decide

186
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:31,920
if it's good enough for me.

187
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,320
If you feel for him so much,

188
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,720
use all resources you have

189
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:36,800
and find someone else for him.

190
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:37,520
You're right.

191
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:38,960
I really have to fill up

192
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,080
the hole you left in Liu.

193
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,000
Otherwise, I fear he will die for love.

194
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,200
That's too much.

195
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,080
When I left today,

196
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:47,360
he looked quite normal.

197
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,800
He was emotionally stable.

198
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:44,600
The movie starts at 6:00.

199
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,160
Don't be late.

200
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,440
The plans have changed.

201
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,320
6:30.

202
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,160
I'll meet you at the private room in Crossroad Bistro.

203
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,000
What else have you messed up?

204
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:05,040
I'm planning to introduce a girl to Liu Liangzhou.

205
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,760
You have to work with me.

206
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:07,440
I have to go.

207
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,880
I've arrived at Liu's place.

208
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:19,960
You're a proper photographer and an artist.

209
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:22,320
It's just a small setback, and you're already half dead.

210
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:23,560
I'm so disappointed.

211
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:24,200
I mean it.

212
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,540
Stop that.

213
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:28,480
You won't understand unless you experience it.

214
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,880
Listen, Liu.

215
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:31,440
You have only two choices.

216
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:32,280
First,

217
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:33,720
cross your fingers every day

218
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:35,680
and hope that my sis and Peng Pai break up again.

219
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:36,320
Second,

220
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,120
find yourself a new girl

221
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:40,160
and fill up the gap in your heart.

222
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,800
I choose neither.

223
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,400
But you can't stay like this, either.

224
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,400
Drinking yourself to oblivion

225
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:47,360
and crying your heart out?

226
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,120
When did I cry my heart out?

227
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,640
Then be quick.

228
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:55,200
Wash your face with water instead of tears,

229
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,640
get changed, and make yourself handsome.

230
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:57,240
Come with me.

231
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:58,480
Be quick.

232
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,440
Get up.

233
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:03,280
Never mind that bleeding heart.

234
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:06,280
Never mind those teary eyes.

235
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:08,200
Today, let me

236
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,240
have a drink

237
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,600
with you.

238
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:13,000
Go on, wash your face.

239
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,760
What's the plan, the three of you?

240
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:18,400
Here.

241
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:19,240
Drink a can, too.

242
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,560
Hefeweissbier from Wurenbacher.

243
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:21,680
Let's drink together.

244
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,920
I can't drink with you.

245
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,600
I still have to keep an eye on the restaurant.

246
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:26,400
Do you know,

247
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,400
Liu?

248
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:29,080
Feng Xi is a woman of profession

249
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:29,800
and responsibility.

250
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,440
She is very devoted.

251
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:32,720
Most importantly,

252
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,360
she is great at taking care of others.

253
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:36,280
She can take care of people so well

254
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:37,440
from up to down

255
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,440
and from inside to outside.

256
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,200
She's so much better at this than my sis.

257
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,400
I mean it, Feng Xi.

258
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:43,160
I really

259
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:45,360
have to learn it from you.

260
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,040
I can't take care of people at all.

261
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:50,080
Am I right, Yu?

262
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:53,200
She's being very honest.

263
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,200
Bao Xue really doesn't know how to take care of others.

264
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:56,760
Feng Xi is so much

265
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:58,200
better than she and her sis in this.

266
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:00,400
Have you been drinking honey?

267
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,800
There's no honey at all.

268
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,400
We're just being honest, can't we?

269
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:05,080
I'm just not as clever as you.

270
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,680
If I didn't devote more,

271
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:08,840
clever people like you wouldn't be friends with me, 
 right?

272
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:10,080
Hear, hear.

273
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:12,480
She's also very modest.

274
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,400
Feng Xi.

275
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:14,520
Yeah.

276
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:16,320
The restaurant totally depends on you.

277
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:17,760
They always tell me that.

278
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:18,680
Right.

279
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:19,280
You're devoted.

280
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:20,280
Cheers.

281
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:21,760
Here's to you.

282
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:23,400
I'll empty it. Be my guest.

283
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:24,160
Thanks.

284
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,400
It might work.

285
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,280
Did you hear what he said just now?

286
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:30,800
"I'll empty it. Be my guest."

287
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:31,800
Liu,

288
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:33,200
you're a true man.

289
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,560
You have a tender heart for the lady.

290
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:35,680
You know how to cherish girls.

291
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,920
He's so much better than that nerd of yours in Germany.

292
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:38,680
It's a happy moment.

293
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:39,480
Don't mention him.

294
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:40,200
Alright, alright.

295
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,000
I won't.

296
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,040
Feng Xi,

297
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:44,440
what do you

298
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,040
think of Liu?

299
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:47,960
He's a good man.

300
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:49,800
Liu,

301
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:51,880
what do you think of Feng Xi?

302
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:53,440
What do you mean?

303
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,240
Are you trying to

304
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:00,960
make a match between...

305
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,560
Exactly, that's what I mean.

306
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,360
Charity begins at home.

307
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:07,520
Bao Xue.

308
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,800
That's annoying.

309
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:11,720
Just ignore her.

310
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,000
She has a thick head.

311
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,000
I'll return to work.

312
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:14,560
Wait.

313
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,280
You look like such a match when sitting together.

314
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:17,720
It was such a harmonious scene.

315
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:18,760
Come on, stop it.

316
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:20,680
Why are you pulling me?

317
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,840
Can you do something reliable?

318
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:24,040
Why am I not reliable?

319
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:25,960
I was being helpful. What's wrong with that?

320
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,320
I told you.

321
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,160
It won't happen.

322
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:28,960
Look at you.

323
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:30,640
Liu,

324
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,440
tell me the truth.

325
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:34,760
Do you think Feng Xi is not good enough for you?

326
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,680
What are you talking about?

327
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:37,960
It's not about

328
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,120
if she's good enough for me.

329
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:40,360
Forget about it.

330
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:41,480
Just stop it for a while.

331
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:43,120
They don't have feelings for each other.

332
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:43,720
Why do you...

333
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:45,360
You're making it too difficult for me.

334
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,520
What type do you like?

335
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:54,920
You're having a drink.

336
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:56,040
Come here. Sit and eat something.

337
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:57,840
I'm tired to death today.

338
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,280
I haven't eaten anything the whole day.

339
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,920
Why are you here today?

340
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,880
We're helping Liu to get rid of his sorrows.

341
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,760
My sis doesn't know chalk from cheese

342
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:08,440
and did something so outrageous.

343
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,640
I worry that he'd kill himself at home

344
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:12,480
and took him here for emotional treatment.

345
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:15,920
Whose drink is this?

346
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:17,120
Feng Xi.

347
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,120
But she barely touched it.

348
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:19,680
Cheers, Liu.

349
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:20,520
I'm sorry.

350
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:21,560
A toast to you.

351
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,120
From now on,

352
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,760
you're welcomed to this place any time.

353
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,800
I'll gift you a life-long membership card with 
 a 30% discount.

354
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:30,640
In the future,

355
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:32,080
order whatever food or drink

356
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:33,320
you want.

357
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:34,880
But that's the same with me.

358
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:36,760
You

359
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:38,360
contributed to us.

360
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:40,000
He is hurt by us.

361
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:40,920
Different reasons,

362
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:42,200
same treatment.

363
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,080
Thanks, Shan.

364
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,320
You haven't hurt me.

365
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,880
Let's not talk about the past.

366
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:55,800
Shan?

367
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,120
Liu.

368
00:15:58,350 --> 00:15:58,850
Shan

369
00:15:58,850 --> 00:16:00,020
has wealth, a career,

370
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:01,440
a good appearance and a fit body.

371
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,280
As the saying goes,

372
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:04,490
“A wife three years older than the husband 
 ensures a richer life.”

373
00:16:04,490 --> 00:16:05,640
Shan happens to be single.

374
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:07,080
If you are with Shan, you can save yourself

375
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:09,080
decades of years of hard work earning money.

376
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:09,680
Shan,

377
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:10,720
don't you like photography?

378
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:13,400
Liu is a senior photographer.

379
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:14,280
He can take photos for you.

380
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:15,440
Stop it.

381
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,480
Especially...

382
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:20,160
What are you plotting?

383
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:24,240
Do you have nothing else to do when there's not filming?

384
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,660
Right. She really has nothing else to do.

385
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:26,680
Shan, let me tell you.

386
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:28,040
Before you arrived,

387
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:29,640
she tried to push Feng Xi to me.

388
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:31,120
After you arrived,

389
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,680
she tries to push you to me.

390
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:33,640
Liu,

391
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:35,200
I have realized.

392
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:37,080
There's something wrong with her family gene.

393
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:38,360
She is the same as her sis.

394
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:39,480
Unreliable.

395
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:41,920
Let me explain it, Shan.

396
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,720
I really did it for your good.

397
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:45,000
Don't you like photographers?

398
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,320
Liu is a photographer. Take photos

399
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:46,920
and I'll help you...

400
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:47,500
Eat something.

401
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:48,890
Wait. Which side are you on?

402
00:16:48,890 --> 00:16:50,600
Why do you try to make a match between everyone?

403
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:52,240
What about you push me to someone else too?

404
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:52,920
Let's have a drink.

405
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:53,800
Let's drink.

406
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:54,480
Sure.

407
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:55,440
Here.

408
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,720
Which type do you like?

409
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:00,000
You're so troublesome.

410
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,840
[Crossroad Bistro]

411
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,760
A dish ordered in-store was sent back yesterday.

412
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:08,720
Yi Dang.

413
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:10,000
It was my fault.

414
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,520
I mistook a medium-rare steak and rice

415
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:12,480
as a medium.

416
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:13,640
Consider it my fault.

417
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:14,599
It's okay.

418
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,079
Don't do it again.

419
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:18,079
Xi,

420
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,760
a vase was broken in the private room last night.

421
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:20,920
I know.

422
00:17:21,079 --> 00:17:22,800
A kid accidentally broke it when running around.

423
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,060
The customer has compensated us.

424
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:26,680
Have you written the discounted dish for today?

425
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:27,359
Not yet.

426
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:28,280
I'll do it now.

427
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:32,200
What was it? Abalone Sauce Dish and...

428
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,480
Assorted Mushrooms.

429
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:35,400
That's a good match.

430
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:36,800
Can't you remember it?

431
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:37,960
You need to ask every time.

432
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,200
Anything sold out?

433
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,320
Not yet.

434
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,000
OK.

435
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,360
Any other problems, everyone?

436
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,640
Did we get rid of the bad review from the day before?

437
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,440
We have apologized.

438
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:51,720
The customer hasn't replied.

439
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:52,560
What then?

440
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:53,840
Nothing happened.

441
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:55,200
Never mind.

442
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:56,640
Get prepared, guys.

443
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:57,400
Today...

444
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:58,400
Do you know that

445
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:00,840
these deliberate bad reviews can 
 destroy a restaurant?

446
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:02,690
Nan,

447
00:18:02,690 --> 00:18:03,940
I don't think we did anything wrong.

448
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:06,350
When he placed the order, 
 we asked him if there's anything he doesn't eat.

449
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:06,910
He denied.

450
00:18:06,910 --> 00:18:08,800
After we served fried black tiger shrimp with garlic,

451
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,690
he said he doesn't eat garlic and demanded to 
 return the dish.

452
00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:11,400
Wasn't that nonsense?

453
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,320
Yeah.

454
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:13,600
I just pointed out

455
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,400
that he didn't say it in the beginning.

456
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:16,200
He said

457
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,110
"Never mind. Leave it here."

458
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:18,460
And immediately wrote a bad review,

459
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:19,890
saying that we have bad service attitudes.

460
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:20,360
Stop it.

461
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:21,000
It's not us.

462
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:21,680
It's you.

463
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:23,880
What's wrong with my attitude?

464
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,280
Why did you reason with him?

465
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:26,960
Just say sorry

466
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:28,240
and send the dish back.

467
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:30,680
He didn't make it clear,

468
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:32,200
why should we pay for that?

469
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,080
Ms. Feng,

470
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:34,680
can you calculate?

471
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,040
Do you know how many customers

472
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:37,480
you will lose because of a bad review?

473
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,240
How much does a dish cost?

474
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,320
Tell me.

475
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:43,280
What should I do?

476
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:44,720
Contact him in private.

477
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:46,600
Coupons.

478
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:47,840
Discounts.

479
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:49,280
Free dishes.

480
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:50,520
I'll let you decide.

481
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:52,320
If you say so,

482
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:53,480
anyone can write a bad review

483
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:54,520
and dine and dash.

484
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:56,600
I'm not trying to argue with you.

485
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,040
We are open for business.

486
00:18:58,040 --> 00:18:59,480
We're bound to see all kinds of people.

487
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:01,520
We aim to earn money,

488
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:03,080
not to dwell on the morality of customers.

489
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:08,000
Alright.

490
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,360
I won't repeat today's tasks.

491
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:11,720
Work hard, everyone.

492
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:13,840
Try to break the record again at the end of the month.

493
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,920
20 minutes to go before we start the service at 11:00.

494
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:18,360
Don't slack.

495
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:20,440
Alright?

496
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:21,320
You're dismissed.

497
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:25,600
Hello. May I ask who's in charge?

498
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:26,560
I am.

499
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:28,640
May I ask who you are?

500
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,660
We are from the Office of Emergency Management.

501
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:31,760
We want to have a look around.

502
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:32,400
Go on.

503
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:34,160
Show us the kitchen first.

504
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:34,960
Sure.

505
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:40,480
Wait a moment, please.

506
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,840
This is against the regulation.

507
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:47,560
What's wrong with this?

508
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:50,040
Are there any other fire exits in your restaurant?

509
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:50,960
No.

510
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:53,040
Then you have to change the stairs into a ramp.

511
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,120
A ramp?

512
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:57,400
Then customers and staff

513
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,440
will easily trip over.

514
00:19:58,440 --> 00:19:59,020
Listen to me.

515
00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:00,120
According to the regulations,

516
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:00,790
fire exits

517
00:20:00,790 --> 00:20:01,810
need to have accessibility.

518
00:20:01,810 --> 00:20:02,570
If there's a fire,

519
00:20:02,570 --> 00:20:03,470
fire-fighting equipment

520
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:04,760
needs to go through without any problem.

521
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:05,880
It's a potential safety hazard.

522
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:06,880
What if customers trip over?

523
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,240
That's a potential safety hazard, too.

524
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:09,600
We regret to inform you

525
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,080
that you have to cooperate with us.

526
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:12,610
You have to shut down until changing this.

527
00:20:12,610 --> 00:20:13,240
Shut down?

528
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:14,920
Why are you finding fault with us?

529
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:16,160
They're just two or three staircases.

530
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:18,200
You can lift practically any equipment 
 with these stairs.

531
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,400
Why do you accuse us?

532
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,570
Who is finding fault with you?

533
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:21,600
Sir, Madam.

534
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:22,960
It's hot.

535
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,600
Drink some water and don't be angry.

536
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:25,200
You're right.

537
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,240
It's our responsibility.

538
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:26,660
We will

539
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:27,810
rectify and improve it right away.

540
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:28,600
We don't need water.

541
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:29,960
Please do understand that

542
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,120
our duty

543
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,560
is to keep everyone safe.

544
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:34,000
We do.

545
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,280
We'll do it right now.

546
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:35,960
OK.

547
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,040
Our number is on the notice.

548
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:39,520
Call us when you finish it.

549
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:40,320
OK.

550
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:41,160
Let's go.

551
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:42,200
Alright.

552
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,200
Madam.

553
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:43,960
Safe journey.

554
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:00,720
Are you stupid?

555
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,880
They were bullying us.

556
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:03,920
Feng Xi.

557
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:06,240
Do you have a delusional disorder of being prosecuted?

558
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,040
It's their job.

559
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:09,440
Everything they said makes sense.

560
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:10,560
When they find the problem,

561
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:12,680
we have to figure out a way to deal with it.

562
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:15,280
Why did you get so emotional and argue so much?

563
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:22,760
Why aren't you working?

564
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:24,320
What's left to do when we are shut down?'

565
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:33,360
We need to

566
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:34,560
ask Yu Songyang to solve this.

567
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,440
Why do you need him?

568
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,160
He's a designer,

569
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:39,080
not a foreman.

570
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:41,800
Then I'll call You Shanshan

571
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:42,800
and ask her to solve it.

572
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:46,320
Can you not turn to her whenever tiny problems occur?

573
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:47,960
What's the point of you being the manager?

574
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:51,120
Who should I ask for help to solve this?

575
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:52,520
Me.

576
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:53,880
We're shut down now.

577
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:54,960
I have nothing to do, anyways.

578
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,040
Alright.

579
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:57,280
Trust this with me.

580
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:59,320
Go and persuade the customer

581
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:00,480
to delete the bad review.

582
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:02,600
OK.

583
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,330
Where did you get these planks?

584
00:22:28,330 --> 00:22:29,600
Building material wholesalers.

585
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:30,640
It's so convenient nowadays.

586
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:31,550
Whatever size you need,

587
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:32,640
they can cut it for you.

588
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:33,960
We just need to fasten the nails.

589
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:35,440
Did he delete the bad review?

590
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:36,880
You were right.

591
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,200
The moment I refunded him in full,

592
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,560
he deleted the bad review immediately.

593
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:40,200
That's it, done.

594
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:42,680
I just feel unhappy

595
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,520
as if he robbed me.

596
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:47,560
Another restaurant I worked for

597
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:50,560
was reported by deliberate customers several times

598
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:52,450
because of fire safety and hygiene problems.

599
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,240
Not long after it opened,

600
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:56,320
we even saw

601
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:57,600
people who ask for

602
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:58,440
a discount

603
00:22:58,440 --> 00:22:59,520
right after eating,

604
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:01,240
threatening if we don't agree,

605
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:02,360
they will write a bad review.

606
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:03,680
There're more interesting things.

607
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,520
The waiter caught a customer putting hair 
 in a dish on site

608
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:07,680
but the customer refused to admit

609
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:08,830
and demanded a free meal.

610
00:23:08,830 --> 00:23:09,440
What can you do?

611
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:10,320
Can you beat him?

612
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:12,450
There're all sorts of shameless people.

613
00:23:12,450 --> 00:23:13,880
They're making something out of nothing

614
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:14,840
while you remain honest.

615
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:16,280
How do you reason with them?

616
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:17,400
These evil guys

617
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,720
are spoiled by people like you.

618
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,640
The most foolish way to die

619
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,240
is to be pissed to death by evil guys.

620
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:27,600
You're so good.

621
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:29,280
You can not only cook

622
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,320
but also do a carpenter's job.

623
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:32,200
You're such a skillful man.

624
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:34,280
It is always good to have more skills.

625
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:35,440
If I can do it myself,

626
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:36,280
I won't trouble others.

627
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:37,560
Go on.

628
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,360
Find some bin bags.

629
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:41,160
OK.

630
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:46,720
You're so thoughtful.

631
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,120
You even bought the paint.

632
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,680
Red catches the eye.

633
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:50,920
The fire safety staff must like it.

634
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:52,320
If you were the boss,

635
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,460
you'd definitely be better than me.

636
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:54,960
Don't change the subject.

637
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:55,960
I have something to tell you.

638
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:58,600
I have something to tell you, too.

639
00:23:58,600 --> 00:23:59,480
You go first.

640
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:00,640
You're the boss, you go first.

641
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:04,400
In the past few days,

642
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,040
I examined the menu and realized

643
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:07,440
one-fourth of the dishes

644
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:08,960
are never ordered online or in-store.

645
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,240
Let's just take them off

646
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,670
and replace them with new dishes.

647
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:13,680
What's the problem?

648
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:15,480
I already have

649
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:17,160
seven or eight new dishes in mind.

650
00:24:17,550 --> 00:24:18,920
We have the same idea by coincidence.

651
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:20,080
What were you about to tell me?

652
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:20,880
It's the same.

653
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:21,880
Alright.

654
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:22,760
It's settled, then.

655
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:24,200
When you have time,

656
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:25,560
cook all the new dishes.

657
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:27,120
I'll ask Liu Liangzhou for help

658
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,120
and take photos of them.

659
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:29,520
We'll reprint the menu.

660
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:30,710
Sure.

661
00:24:30,710 --> 00:24:31,680
I'll do as you command, boss.

662
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:32,720
Manager Feng,

663
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,520
what's happening today?

664
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:35,480
Are you closed?

665
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:37,320
We are shut down to rectify today.

666
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:40,640
When will you reopen?

667
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,320
We'll try to open it tomorrow.

668
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:43,640
OK.

669
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:45,240
Let's go to another restaurant.

670
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:45,960
Come back tomorrow.

671
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:46,640
OK. Bye-bye.

672
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:47,240
Alright.

673
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:48,240
Bye-bye.

674
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:51,680
Stay away from it

675
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:52,990
in case the spray gets on your face.

676
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:57,240
All done.

677
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:01,360
It's not ugly like this.

678
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:03,440
Boss,

679
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:05,240
give me the money.

680
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:07,660
I'll surely give you a thick red packet.

681
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:10,560
Who asked for a red packet?

682
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:12,520
I want the money for the materials.

683
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:13,840
I'll include that in.

684
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:15,400
Ding,

685
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:16,680
get me a bottle of 480 Lang Liquor.

686
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:18,760
All bosses are black-hearted.

687
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,080
Add it to my account.

688
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:23,640
I gift this to you.

689
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:25,240
Thank you.

690
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:26,120
You're my benefactor.

691
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:27,440
Alright.

692
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:28,200
I'll cook a few dishes.

693
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:29,000
Let's drink together.

694
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:30,600
OK.

695
00:25:31,450 --> 00:25:33,240
Which account should I put the dishes on?

696
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:50,480
Don't shout at me in front of so many staff in the future.

697
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:53,120
Maybe I'm just a small manager, but I'm also a partner.

698
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:55,920
Did I hurt your pride?

699
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,240
I'll drink first to apologize.

700
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:07,600
This alcohol is good.

701
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,560
I'm okay when You Shanshan and Dai Xiaoyu scold me.

702
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:12,540
When you also scold me,

703
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:14,640
I feel like a broken drum hit by everyone.

704
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:16,120
Alright.

705
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:17,320
Don't overthink.

706
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:18,960
It has passed.

707
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:21,040
Here.

708
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:22,480
Try this.

709
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:27,360
It's hot.

710
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:31,000
What do you think?

711
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:35,520
It's tasty.

712
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:36,760
It's a new dish.

713
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,160
Lychee Prawn Balls.

714
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:43,040
Set a price, boss.

715
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:46,840
This dish tonight

716
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:48,600
is priceless.

717
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:54,720
Thank you.

718
00:26:58,160 --> 00:26:58,840
How do you thank me?

719
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:03,000
I'll

720
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:04,040
fill the cup.

721
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:07,960
I'll empty it.

722
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:38,640
I'm so tired.

723
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,040
I don't want to organize things.

724
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:41,880
You're tired, right?

725
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:43,440
I'll get it done for you.

726
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:48,520
Buy a carpet tomorrow

727
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:49,910
for the floor underneath you.

728
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:51,080
Another one

729
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:51,960
for here and another one

730
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:53,480
for the tea table.

731
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:56,560
The renting price is over 20,000 RMB per month.

732
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:59,720
You bought so much extra stuff.

733
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:01,960
Are you not planning to go back to Norway?

734
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:14,960
Well...

735
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:17,520
When I wasn't with you,

736
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:18,800
I always thought about you

737
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:21,240
in your position right now.

738
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:25,960
But you haven't answered me.

739
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:26,720
What?

740
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:28,680
Are you not planning to go back to Norway?

741
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:34,200
I was thinking

742
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:38,960
that you don't wish to

743
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:41,000
quit your current job

744
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:41,640
and that

745
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:42,760
you really like the restaurant

746
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:44,320
opened by you and your friends.

747
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:46,440
It means

748
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:48,400
you need to spend a lot of

749
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:49,280
time here.

750
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:51,160
Considering the situation we're in,

751
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:53,320
I'll travel between Norway and China for now.

752
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:55,120
I can manage to move

753
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:56,400
my main business

754
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:57,400
from Norway

755
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:58,320
to China within one year.

756
00:28:58,840 --> 00:28:59,760
In that case,

757
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:02,560
we won't be parted anymore.

758
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:07,520
This time, it's not just words.

759
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:09,960
I have contacted two companies that are willing

760
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:11,320
to cooperate in the past few days.

761
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,200
I'll deliver my promises.

762
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:19,440
But you've been working on

763
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:21,080
the company there for so many years.

764
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:23,440
I don't want you to give up your business there

765
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:24,760
just because of me.

766
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:26,440
It's a business transformation,

767
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:27,400
not losing my job.

768
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:28,120
Right?

769
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,040
Also, I've thought about it.

770
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:31,360
If you want to go back to Norway,

771
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:32,280
I will follow you.

772
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:33,440
Right?

773
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:34,760
We keep renting this place.

774
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:35,760
When you come back,

775
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:37,360
you can stay here once in a while.

776
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:40,440
That's such a waste.

777
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:42,080
If we stay in hotels when we come back,

778
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:43,200
it won't cost much.

779
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:45,080
There's no need for a long-term lease.

780
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,800
That's not the same.

781
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:48,800
When you stay in hotels,

782
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,120
don't you feel it's always like traveling?

783
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:52,200
It's not like going home.

784
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:54,480
When we have a flat,

785
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:55,560
we can call it home.

786
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:57,480
I want you to feel like coming back home.

787
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:58,520
Also, I've thought about it.

788
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:00,400
If the cash flow is good,

789
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,760
we can actually buy a flat

790
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:03,440
in Beijing.

791
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:06,360
To be honest,

792
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:07,520
I don't always have to

793
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:08,720
manage the restaurant.

794
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:10,130
Before this,

795
00:30:10,130 --> 00:30:11,160
I went there every day

796
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:12,520
because Feng Xi just broke up

797
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:13,880
and often made mistakes.

798
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:16,680
Also, I have shares in the restaurant

799
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:18,240
and can't just withdraw when I want.

800
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:18,960
What for?

801
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:20,360
Do you plan to

802
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:21,360
get your money out

803
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:22,640
and buy the flat with me?

804
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:24,520
There's no need.

805
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:25,680
As long as you're happy

806
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:27,960
about the restaurant, it's fine for me.

807
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:29,880
It doesn't matter that much if you earn money or not.

808
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:30,800
Don't be too anxious.

809
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:33,440
I don't want to depend on you for everything.

810
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:35,320
If this goes on,

811
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:37,080
I will gradually lose myself.

812
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:40,040
I don't want to go back to the life I lived before.

813
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:43,600
In the past,

814
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:44,480
I never realized

815
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,600
you have such a passion for work.

816
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,440
What did you tell me the other day?

817
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:50,000
That boss of yours, Mr. Chai.

818
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:51,720
He offers you a job

819
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:52,920
without much pressure

820
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:53,960
but with a good salary.

821
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:55,920
I was wondering

822
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:58,640
where you can find such a great boss?

823
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,240
Do you also think he overpays me?

824
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:03,440
Then tell me.

825
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:06,480
Is there a stupid boss?

826
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:09,520
Chai is not stupid.

827
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:12,440
Back then, it happened that the girl

828
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:14,080
from his company

829
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:15,680
who always entertain clients

830
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:17,160
with him was pregnant

831
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:18,720
and quit her job.

832
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:19,840
He had no candidate

833
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:20,960
and had his eyes on me.

834
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:23,280
He what?

835
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:25,480
Had his eyes on me.

836
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:26,360
Exactly.

837
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:27,120
Right?

838
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:28,680
When you work with him,

839
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:31,120
why would I not worry

840
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:32,480
and overthink?

841
00:31:33,130 --> 00:31:35,280
Are you afraid that he is up to something bad with me?

842
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:35,960
Yes.

843
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:37,240
I'm extremely afraid.

844
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:41,440
I think he was like that in the beginning.

845
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:44,160
But on my first day at work,

846
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:46,920
I helped him saved a big contract.

847
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:47,720
I was even surprised

848
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:49,120
that I have such great capacity.

849
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:51,600
Since then,

850
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:53,880
Chai was impressed by me.

851
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:54,920
Also,

852
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:56,880
I made it very clear the day I was on board

853
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:59,080
that I'm here for work,

854
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:00,640
not for affairs.

855
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:02,360
I believe what you said.

856
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:03,360
You're so clever.

857
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:05,720
If anyone is up to no good with you,

858
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:07,160
his efforts will be in vain, right?

859
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:09,680
There're so many things.

860
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:11,120
You can't finish organizing today.

861
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:12,400
Let's continue tomorrow.

862
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:13,480
I'm getting sleepy.

863
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:14,720
OK.

864
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:16,360
Let's do it tomorrow.

865
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:18,280
Let's go to sleep.

866
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:21,720
You sleep in the bed

867
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:23,320
and I sleep on the couch.

868
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:25,560
Come on.

869
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:27,680
Don't make me look so heartless.

870
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:29,990
Then let's do it just like the old days.

871
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:38,480
Here we go.

872
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:41,240
Have you put on weight?

873
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:42,200
Am I heavier?

874
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:42,880
Yeah.

875
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:50,640
Isn't it nice?

876
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:52,560
Not only it complies with fire safety requirements,

877
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:53,400
but it looks nice.

878
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:54,280
You're right.

879
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:55,400
We have to comply with the rules.

880
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:56,800
Safety is the most important matter.

881
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:58,230
Where's the notice I gave you yesterday?

882
00:32:58,230 --> 00:32:58,840
Here.

883
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:02,320
Alright.

884
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:03,440
Let's cooperate with

885
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:04,520
each other in the future.

886
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:05,350
It's not easy for us.

887
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:07,390
Let's not make it more difficult for each other.

888
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:08,920
Safe journey.

889
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:09,600
Goodbye.

890
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:17,760
Hello.

891
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:18,800
Here's a package for you.

892
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:20,040
We're still resting.

893
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:20,800
Please keep quiet.

894
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:22,960
Thanks.

895
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,000
Close the door for me, please.

896
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:35,640
Did that guy wake you up?

897
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,680
Why are you up so early?

898
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:39,960
Early?

899
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:40,920
It's midday already.

900
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:44,760
How about this?

901
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:46,920
Am I efficient?

902
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:48,260
I just ordered the carpet last night

903
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:49,800
and they deliver it this morning.

904
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:58,240
How about this?

905
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,440
You like the pattern

906
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:02,200
and the color, right?

907
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:03,400
They're fine.

908
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:05,440
Yeah?

909
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:07,160
If we put something

910
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:08,840
of our own, this place

911
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:10,320
will look more like home.

912
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:17,320
I want to

913
00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:19,440
visit your grandma with you this afternoon.

914
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:22,560
Let's wait a bit more time.

915
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:23,880
OK.

916
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:25,920
You can also invite

917
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:27,120
your sis and your friends

918
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:29,440
here for lunch or dinner, right?

919
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:31,679
Later on.

920
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:33,880
Do you have plans for today?

921
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:37,600
Bao Xue said we need to go to the restaurant 
 and try new dishes.

922
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:41,320
I can go with you.

923
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:43,199
I haven't tried the dishes from your restaurant.

924
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:45,920
Forget about it.

925
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:48,880
I'm afraid it'll be awkward when you meed You Shanshan.

926
00:34:51,159 --> 00:34:52,679
Why would that be awkward?

927
00:34:52,679 --> 00:34:54,800
We have to meet each other sooner or later, right?

928
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:56,159
Also, you are her good friend.

929
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:58,520
When she sees that you are so happy,

930
00:34:58,520 --> 00:34:59,680
she should bless you.

931
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:01,600
I'd rather not.

932
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:03,010
I won't go there today.

933
00:35:03,010 --> 00:35:04,440
They asked for Liu Liangzhou's help

934
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:05,720
to take photos of new dishes.

935
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:07,760
It's better if I don't go and make him upset.

936
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:08,920
I'll go to the company.

937
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:10,200
Chai is back today.

938
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:27,200
It's so pretty.

939
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:29,400
What's the name of this?

940
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:39,520
Have a bowl, too.

941
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:41,800
I can't eat this.

942
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:43,840
This is really good.

943
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:44,920
I've been eating it for a while.

944
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:45,600
Look.

945
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:47,520
My skin has become so smooth now, right?

946
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:50,400
It's a specialty only for you from your dear Yu Songyang.

947
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,800
You should eat more.

948
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:53,480
Come on, have a bowl.

949
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:54,560
Shan,

950
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:56,360
Feng Xi told me

951
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:57,320
that we were shut down

952
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:59,080
some time ago.

953
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:02,680
We didn't pass the fire safety check.

954
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:04,240
We had to change the stairs

955
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:05,560
in the front hall into a ramp.

956
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:07,340
We were closed for one day just because of that.

957
00:36:07,340 --> 00:36:08,560
Why didn't you come to me?

958
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:09,520
It's okay. We've solved it.

959
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:12,520
How much money did you bribe them?

960
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:15,000
Who dares taking a bribe nowadays?

961
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,280
We followed the rules.

962
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:17,800
I really thought

963
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,080
Feng Xi would come to you.

964
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:21,000
I didn't expect they solved it by themselves.

965
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:21,600
They?

966
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:23,320
Feng Xi and who?

967
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:24,720
Zhao Henan.

968
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:28,120
They can be a good match.

969
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:29,680
There you go again.

970
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:30,880
Come on, stop it.

971
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:31,440
I mean it.

972
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:32,800
The first dish is here.

973
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:45,920
This looks really like

974
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:47,840
white sheets hung out on the balcony.

975
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:49,840
You're right.

976
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:51,720
The name Zhao Henan gave it

977
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:53,200
is Hung Out White Meat.

978
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:54,640
That's a vivid description.

979
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:56,000
It's mine after the photos are taken.

980
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:56,800
Have you set the price?

981
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:57,800
Not yet.

982
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:59,960
We will try four new dishes today.

983
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:00,880
We also have

984
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:01,860
Lychee Prawn Balls,

985
00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:03,800
Baked Cheese Boston Lobster with Green Mustard

986
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:05,520
and Jerky and Prawn Cake Sandwich.

987
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:07,570
Let's set the price together after trying all of them.

988
00:37:07,570 --> 00:37:08,000
OK.

989
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:08,930
Are they all prawn dishes?

990
00:37:08,930 --> 00:37:09,400
Yes.

991
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:11,110
All prawn dishes except for Hung Out White Meat.

992
00:37:11,110 --> 00:37:11,720
How did it go?

993
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:13,720
I'll have a look.

994
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:19,560
I really want to start eating.

995
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:20,400
Don't be impatient.

996
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:21,720
He hasn't finished taking photos.

997
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:25,520
That's a nice photo.

998
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:27,480
Look at those highlights.

999
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:28,320
The grease

1000
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:29,480
makes it look so appetizing.

1001
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:30,720
How did it go?

1002
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:31,800
Did you get a good photo?

1003
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:33,560
I really want to eat it.

1004
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:35,120
I think so.

1005
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:35,880
You can start eating.

1006
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:37,280
Come on.

1007
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:40,200
I will have a proper taste of this.

1008
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:41,960
Liu.

1009
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:43,560
Liu.

1010
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:45,840
A classmate of mine

1011
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:47,640
just broke up recently.

1012
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:49,160
She looks really like the younger Song Jia.

1013
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:50,440
She is elegant, generous

1014
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:51,520
and not a trouble at all.

1015
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:53,320
She is so much more reliable than Dai Xiaoyu.

1016
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:54,000
Tomorrow,

1017
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,200
I will tell her to go to your studio to take photos.

1018
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:57,040
You can

1019
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:58,120
swoop in on her.

1020
00:37:58,120 --> 00:37:59,440
Come on, that's enough.

1021
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:00,400
Can you

1022
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,280
stop mentioning Dai Xiaoyu?

1023
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:04,040
I'm not desperate for women.

1024
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:05,840
It's so delicious.

1025
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:06,840
The meat melts in my mouth.

1026
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:07,680
Really.

1027
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:08,880
Don't be angry.

1028
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:10,680
Try it.

1029
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:13,440
Leave some to me.

1030
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:14,880
Here.

1031
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:16,320
Here we go.

1032
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:18,200
If it's my decision, I'll pick the one we saw just now.

1033
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:19,840
Put effort into learning it when you go back

1034
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:20,560
and cook for my sis.

1035
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:21,360
Here, Shan.

1036
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:22,080
Thanks.

1037
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:23,280
Why don't you learn it?

1038
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:26,240
Don't challenge me.

1039
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:28,640
I will study it when you're away.

1040
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:30,760
When I learn it, I'll make it for someone else.

1041
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:33,160
Where are you going?

1042
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:33,880
A business trip?

1043
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:35,540
Great Cloudy Mountains in Hengnan.

1044
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:38,400
Business trip, my ass.

1045
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:40,040
It's like seeking death.

1046
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:42,240
I'm sorry.

1047
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:43,240
I can't mention that word.

1048
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:43,680
I forgot.

1049
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:44,560
I can't mention "death".

1050
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:47,240
He is going to climb high mountains.

1051
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:47,960
Rock climbing.

1052
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:48,920
Free climbing.

1053
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:51,200
It's over a hundred meters.

1054
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:52,520
He won't even have climbing ropes.

1055
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:53,840
What if he misses a step

1056
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:55,760
and makes a mistake that brings eternal regret?

1057
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:58,880
Why does it sound so dangerous?

1058
00:38:58,880 --> 00:38:59,720
Why do you go there?

1059
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:02,360
Can you not go?

1060
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:04,240
I really don't feel good about it.

1061
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:06,560
Free climbing isn't climbing with eyes closed.

1062
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:08,560
We do use climbing ropes before we start.

1063
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:10,720
You need to be familiar with every route

1064
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:12,880
and remember all the grips.

1065
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:13,800
I even know in my dreams

1066
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:15,280
where to step and where to grab.

1067
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:16,440
Rest assured.

1068
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:17,160
I have put them

1069
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:18,400
completely in my consciousness.

1070
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:19,960
Songyang, I don't really understand.

1071
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:21,400
Does it mean that with the climbing rope,

1072
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:22,200
you won't be in danger

1073
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:23,200
even if you miss a step?

1074
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:25,300
Nothing is completely secure.

1075
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:27,300
The possibility that you're hit by a car

1076
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:28,960
is higher than making a mistake in free climbing.

1077
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:29,520
Nonsense.

1078
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:31,000
It won't be me.

1079
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,400
I don't think you are right.

1080
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:34,680
If you were hit by a car,

1081
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:36,280
you'd probably be saved.

1082
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:38,000
But if you accidentally fall

1083
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:38,800
in free climbing,

1084
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:40,520
you'll be smashed into pieces.

1085
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:42,160
Don't worry.

1086
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:44,800
This time, my friend will do the free climbing.

1087
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,400
I will be in charge of the climbing rope

1088
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:48,080
and record the whole process for him.

1089
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:49,320
It won't be me until the next time.

1090
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:51,760
Don't worry.

1091
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:55,280
Why am I in love with such a crazy man like you?

1092
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:56,840
What can you do about it?

1093
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,040
Be safe.

1094
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:00,680
Rest assured.

1095
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:02,640
Here, have a look.

1096
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:03,520
How's this?

1097
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:04,880
It's eye candy.
