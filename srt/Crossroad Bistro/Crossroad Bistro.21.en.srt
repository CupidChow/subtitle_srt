4
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:01,920
Sis.

5
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,480
How long will you 
keep your relationship a secret?

6
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:06,120
I think it's time for you to introduce

7
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,680
Peng Pai to grandma, isn't it?

8
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:09,880
What's the hurry?

9
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:11,800
I'm thinking about

10
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,440
going back to Hangzhou these days.

11
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,520
You told your dad?

12
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,400
Nope.

13
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:22,560
What a competitive family you have.

14
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,079
You against your father.

15
00:02:24,079 --> 00:02:26,040
Your father against his mother.

16
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:28,120
It's no big deal.

17
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:30,079
All you need is a couple of words.

18
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:31,760
A couple of words.

19
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,520
We would fight within three sentences.

20
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,000
I've made my mind.

21
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,280
I won't discuss this with anyone.

22
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,280
We will let them know

23
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:42,720
after we get married.

24
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,000
Just so they could know that we are doing okay.

25
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,400
As for grandma,

26
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,640
she should be fine with it

27
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,120
as long as you are around.

28
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,880
When do you plan to get married?

29
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,400
He's been busy at work lately.

30
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,720
And it's not going very well.

31
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,000
Maybe in a while.

32
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:01,840
As long as you can get married

33
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,160
before you are too old.

34
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,200
Why are you more anxious than me?

35
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:10,480
I'm really anxious for you.

36
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,760
Maybe granny can beat you to it.

37
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,040
If you wait long enough,

38
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,240
maybe Doctor Lu and granny will get married

39
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,680
before you do.

40
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,640
That'll be good.

41
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:20,800
Good?

42
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:21,840
Woman.

43
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,560
Why are you not motivated at all?

44
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:25,040
What did you say?

45
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,200
I do whatever I like.

46
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,040
Granny, I don't want rice.

47
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,200
Why?

48
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,920
Hunger strike?

49
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,840
I'll start shooting in Huairou tomorrow.

50
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,600
When I went to get makeup last time,

51
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,520
the director said that I gained weight.

52
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,400
You did not.

53
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,800
Does he want a skeleton?

54
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:50,160
Grandma, ignore her. I'll eat.

55
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:50,880
Atta girl.

56
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:54,960
You never eat rice.

57
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:57,160
What happened today?

58
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:59,000
Grandma made us such delicious food.

59
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,600
It'll be a huge waste to not eat rice.

60
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,040
I don't know what's going on with me recently.

61
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,080
I always feel hungry.

62
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:08,400
What?

63
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,400
Why is it so fishy?

64
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:11,280
Fishy?

65
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,280
Let me try it.

66
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:17,240
I don't think so.

67
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,240
Just don't eat it.

68
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:19,959
Here.

69
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:20,920
Have some ribs.

70
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:23,880
Granny.

71
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:25,960
Do you remember,

72
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:26,560
when I was young,

73
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,560
I was in a painting competition?

74
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,640
You took me there.

75
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:31,840
I won the first prize.

76
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:32,720
Do you remember that?

77
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:33,640
Of course, I do.

78
00:04:34,159 --> 00:04:35,680
That was a long time ago.

79
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,600
Granny, did you keep that certificate?

80
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,320
Why should she keep that garbage?

81
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,360
I need it.

82
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,800
Granny. Please think about it.

83
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,880
Did you keep the certificate?

84
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:46,960
I did.

85
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,680
When you were little,

86
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,080
Xiaoyu was a straight-A student.

87
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,200
She brought home lots of 
certificates of merit every year

88
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,600
that it was not new to her anymore.

89
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,680
Xue was not as good.

90
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,880
You didn't get a certificate of merit often.

91
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,040
You even tried to go to bed with them.

92
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:02,120
Granny.

93
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:03,800
Can you see the gap?

94
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:04,720
Yeah.

95
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,840
That's why you don't cherish

96
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:08,520
what you should cherish now.

97
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:09,800
Still, better than you.

98
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,960
See everything as a treasure.

99
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:12,840
I do whatever I like.

100
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:15,080
Bite me. Bite me.

101
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:17,200
It's in the storeroom cabinet.

102
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,360
Get it yourself.

103
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,120
Thank you, granny.

104
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:25,920
Look at all these dishes.

105
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,000
You don't eat any of them.

106
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,200
But eating rice with soup?

107
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:31,960
I love your spicy and sour soup.

108
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:33,560
The world's best.

109
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,360
Then have some more.

110
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,400
Granny!

111
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,080
What?

112
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,200
What's so fuss about?

113
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,320
How could you do that?

114
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,240
Not telling us this?

115
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,800
We are family!

116
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:50,240
It's not a big deal.

117
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,480
Not a big deal?

118
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,400
Bone fracture is not a big deal?

119
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,920
Grandma!

120
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,240
Alright. Alright.

121
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,680
Sit down and eat.

122
00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:59,760
It's really not a big deal.

123
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:00,640
I am all cured now.

124
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:01,680
Look.

125
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,920
Why can you rely on us more?

126
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:10,200
Why didn't you tell us about your injury?

127
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:11,800
You don't like us?

128
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,120
You didn't want us to take care of you?

129
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:14,480
I appreciate it.

130
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,080
But you are all very busy.

131
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,120
It's really not a big deal.

132
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,000
Two days.

133
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,080
I learned to eat with my left hand in two days.

134
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,400
Check this out.

135
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,600
Don't think we will let you off easily.

136
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:30,560
We are not kidding.

137
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,480
Look at the date.

138
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,320
A long time ago!

139
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:36,120
It must be so inconvenient for you, living alone.

140
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:38,200
I doubt it.

141
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,800
Why didn't you ask us to take care of you?

142
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,120
There must be somebody who did our job.

143
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,880
Doctor Lu.

144
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,240
He visited me often.

145
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,080
He helped me out.

146
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:49,200
See? What did I say?

147
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,440
Somebody did our job.

148
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:52,159
That's why we were not wanted.

149
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,600
I'm getting a bit jealous.

150
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,600
Now, old lady.

151
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,520
When are you going to have it?

152
00:06:59,159 --> 00:07:00,400
Have what?

153
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,160
The wedding.

154
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:06,280
A wedding for people my age?

155
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:08,480
It's nice enough to

156
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,640
have a company in old age.

157
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:10,560
No way.

158
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:12,640
You must have a fabulous wedding.

159
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,480
It's the most important thing in your life.

160
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,040
It cannot be low-key.

161
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:20,880
I won't have a wedding

162
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,120
until I attend both of yours.

163
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,000
So.

164
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,240
You.

165
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,840
When will your wedding be?

166
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:29,640
Mine?

167
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:33,280
I'm still young.

168
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,240
I'm not in a rush.

169
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:37,240
What about him?

170
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,920
Have you met his parents?

171
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,360
Do they like you?

172
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,800
Granny.

173
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:43,800
Rest assured.

174
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,760
Everything will be just fine.

175
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,320
Stop worrying about me.

176
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:48,240
If you really want to,

177
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,360
you can ask Dai Xiao...

178
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,680
Grandma. This is amazing.

179
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,440
I want a refill.

180
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,159
Sure.

181
00:07:54,159 --> 00:07:55,480
Let me.

182
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,240
Thank you, grandma.

183
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,560
Be careful.

184
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,240
Hello.

185
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:14,920
Hello.

186
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:15,640
Table for two?

187
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:18,080
Miss.

188
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,600
Are you Feng Xi?

189
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,200
Yes, I am. And you are?

190
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,000
We are Zhao Henan's parents.

191
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:26,040
What a pleasure. Please come in.

192
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:26,680
Thanks.

193
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:29,640
Beware of the steps.

194
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:30,720
Of course.

195
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,919
Let's sit inside. It's quiet there.

196
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:34,679
OK.

197
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,200
Please sit down.

198
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,840
Wen. Clean it up.

199
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,520
I'll get Henan.

200
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:42,880
No. Don't bother.

201
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:43,640
Let him work.

202
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:44,960
Ding. Two cups of tea here.

203
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:56,960
Your parents are here.

204
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,560
My parents are here?

205
00:08:58,560 --> 00:08:59,320
Yi Tang.

206
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,080
Watch my station.

207
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:00,600
OK.

208
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,080
Feng Xi, wait.

209
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,840
Don't forget what I told you.

210
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,680
Never.

211
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:12,800
OK. Let's go.

212
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:20,920
Why all of a sudden?

213
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:22,040
I told you to

214
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:23,440
tell me before you come.

215
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,040
I will pick you up.

216
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,240
I've worked in the kitchen all my life.

217
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:29,320
I know how busy you are at this time.

218
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:30,240
So we took a taxi

219
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,440
and came by ourselves.

220
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,600
Yeah. No worries.

221
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,360
Mr. and Mrs. Zhao.

222
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:35,440
Try our dishes.

223
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:36,480
Thank you.

224
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,360
You're welcome.

225
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,000
Enjoy.

226
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,480
I'll come over when I finish my work.

227
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:40,120
Sure.

228
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:40,800
Go ahead.

229
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:41,400
OK.

230
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:47,560
Not bad.

231
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:50,200
It's just a little bit undercooked.

232
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,360
It shouldn't.

233
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,640
Lower your voice.

234
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:53,920
You have to be a know-it-all.

235
00:09:58,760 --> 00:09:59,560
Son.

236
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,320
How long?

237
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:03,480
Nine months.

238
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,520
It's been nine months before you tell us?

239
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,320
What a good son!

240
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,600
Didn't I tell you all in advance?

241
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:14,160
Your mother is asking about you and the girl.

242
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,280
How long have you dated?

243
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:16,000
Yeah.

244
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:18,600
We...

245
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,520
Not long.

246
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:20,640
A month or two.

247
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,360
As people say,

248
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,040
love will come in time.

249
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:23,720
Right?

250
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:27,080
Son.

251
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,240
I think Feng Xi

252
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,600
is a lovely girl.

253
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:31,520
Look at her face.

254
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:32,880
Always smiling.

255
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:33,760
I like her.

256
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,200
Mr. Zhao, how do you think?

257
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,760
Not bad.

258
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:38,560
Henan said that

259
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,200
you are the real expert.

260
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,520
Please give us a review.

261
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:41,960
Good.

262
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,040
Very good.

263
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:44,080
Thank you.

264
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,000
Come here.

265
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,160
Take a break.

266
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,040
Get up.

267
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:47,880
OK.

268
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:48,400
Come here.

269
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,360
Sit.

270
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,800
Sit here.

271
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:53,120
Feng Xi.

272
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,920
Where are you from?

273
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:55,960
Jingzhou, Hubei province.

274
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,560
A girl from Hubei.

275
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:58,680
Wonderful.

276
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:00,640
Girls from Hubei are capable 
and able to keep a family.

277
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:03,520
Feng Xi.

278
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:04,840
Does Henan.

279
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:05,880
treat you well?

280
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,560
Of course.

281
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:10,360
Henan is just like his father.

282
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,680
So stubborn.

283
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,640
Sometimes he can be not that lovable.

284
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:14,920
Don't be mad at him.

285
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:15,880
I won't.

286
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:16,920
He is a nice guy.

287
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,240
Really?

288
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,120
Dad.

289
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,640
How long will you stay this time?

290
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:21,880
Four or five days.

291
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:22,240
Yes.

292
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,360
We will go to Shandong

293
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,080
to visit our old classmates after this.

294
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:25,840
Good for you.

295
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:26,840
Oh right.

296
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:27,920
Did you book a hotel room?

297
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,600
We've already made a reservation.

298
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,400
We won't cause any trouble to you.

299
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:33,720
Henan.

300
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:34,200
Look.

301
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,280
It's very hard for you to run this restaurant.

302
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:37,480
In the next few days,

303
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:38,840
your dad and I will go to your place

304
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:40,880
and cook you some of his special dishes.

305
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,080
You can relax a bit.

306
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,200
Great.

307
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,520
I got work to do in the kitchen.

308
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:47,920
Dad. Mom. Enjoy the food.

309
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:48,440
Feng Xi.

310
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,520
Take good care of my parents.

311
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:50,320
Sure.

312
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,000
What a good game you've played.

313
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:57,080
Now you can't get yourself out.

314
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,080
Alright.

315
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,880
Don't worry.

316
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,640
Take things as they come.

317
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:03,640
Act the full set.

318
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:04,360
OK?

319
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,120
I have a car.

320
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,240
I'll let the driver take it there in a while.

321
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,120
For the following days,

322
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,040
Henan can drive this car

323
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,280
and show his parents around.

324
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,760
Are you asking me that?

325
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:18,160
You are their future daughter-in-law.

326
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,400
If you ask me,

327
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:20,880
I will keep them company.

328
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:23,800
No worries.

329
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:26,000
I can watch the restaurant for a while.

330
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,080
OK?

331
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:30,160
Stop nagging.

332
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,440
It's a piece of cake for me.

333
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:33,480
Eight companies.

334
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:34,480
And I'm still alright.

335
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:35,680
Gotta go.

336
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:37,040
What?

337
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,480
The proposal for the 
Wednesday meeting has been sent to you.

338
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:39,160
Please take a look.

339
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:39,920
OK.

340
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:46,640
Ms. Feng, dinner.

341
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:47,520
OK.

342
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,800
Now the game is getting serious.

343
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:56,920
I should apologize to you.

344
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:58,800
I didn't expect

345
00:12:58,800 --> 00:12:59,960
my mom would do that.

346
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:02,080
What can we do?

347
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,480
We should act the full set.

348
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:05,920
You can't tell them that

349
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,400
you lied to them right now.

350
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,960
Should I just tell them the truth?

351
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:10,680
Don't.

352
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:13,480
You don't want to make your mad at you.

353
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,240
What else can we do?

354
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:19,120
You heard them.

355
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,080
My mom said

356
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,720
she'll let my dad go to your place and cook for us.

357
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:26,800
My place?

358
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,400
I thought

359
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:30,840
we'll go to your place.

360
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:32,480
We can't.

361
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:33,800
I have a roommate.

362
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,680
I can't ask him to move out.

363
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:37,800
Please.

364
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,440
You make so much money.

365
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,440
But you don't even

366
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,760
get yourself a private space?

367
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:44,000
I save my money to buy a house.

368
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,320
I don't want to get married

369
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,280
without a house.

370
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:49,080
Funny.

371
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,600
You look cool.

372
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:51,920
I thought

373
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,600
you'd spend all your money.

374
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,680
I'm kinda surprised.

375
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,360
You are a nice guy.

376
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:57,680
Cut it out.

377
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:58,880
Don't tease me.

378
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:00,800
Think about what we should do.

379
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:07,880
What can we do?

380
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,080
Go to my place.

381
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:12,280
Listen.

382
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:14,000
You Shanshan will send a car over later.

383
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,080
You can show them around.

384
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,880
I'll go home and make the house clean.

385
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:18,600
What?

386
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,000
Are you silly?

387
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
I have to make the place

388
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,600
look like two people are living here.

389
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:25,160
Right.

390
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:26,600
You remind me.

391
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,480
I should go back to my place

392
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,240
and get some clothes to put in your house.

393
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,080
We don't want to get busted.

394
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:33,200
Just several days.

395
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,520
We can make it.

396
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:36,800
Never thought we can use

397
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,200
your funny ideas.

398
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:40,960
I have no choice.

399
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:44,240
My parents just arrived.

400
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:45,800
I have to take a half-day off

401
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:47,600
to accompany them this afternoon.

402
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:48,720
Sure.

403
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:49,920
Sounds about right.

404
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52,480
But I can't stay with them every day.

405
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,760
The kitchen needs me.

406
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:00,720
I got it.

407
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:02,600
Let's take turns.

408
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,040
That'll be great.

409
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,360
Thank you.

410
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,240
Let's have dinner.

411
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:20,560
I'll get it.

412
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:21,680
Let me.

413
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:23,120
That's the food I ordered.

414
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:27,680
Your takeaway.

415
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:28,040
Thanks.

416
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:29,520
Enjoy your meal.

417
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,240
Hot and Sour Rice Noodles.

418
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,040
Yeah.

419
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:41,680
Didn't you eat at grandma's house?

420
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:43,360
I'm hungry now.

421
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:43,920
If so,

422
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,520
get something nutritious.

423
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:46,720
What's that?

424
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,800
I want to eat it.

425
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:16,520
Hello?

426
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:24,240
Where are you now?

427
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:31,160
OK.

428
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:32,600
Be right there.

429
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:47,320
Xiaoyu.

430
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:47,800
Hmm?

431
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:49,000
I need to go out for a while.

432
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,400
Isn't that dinner party at night?

433
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:52,520
Why so early?

434
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:55,400
They said we need to talk before dinner.

435
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:57,200
OK.

436
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,140
Don't drink too much.

437
00:16:58,180 --> 00:16:59,240
Don't worry. I won't drink tonight.

438
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:00,160
I'll be back after dinner.

439
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:01,360
Bye.

440
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:03,080
Bye-bye.

441
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,200
Does your mother know that you came to Beijing?

442
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:09,200
No.

443
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,800
You are always a brave kid.

444
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:13,920
Such a long way.

445
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:15,200
What if something goes wrong?

446
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:16,960
I am not a kid anymore.

447
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:19,640
Dad.

448
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:22,319
Do you support me studying abroad?

449
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:23,200
Studying abroad is good.

450
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,960
I definitely support you.

451
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:29,760
But I...

452
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:32,080
I have been abroad for so many years.

453
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:33,480
To be honest,

454
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:35,640
foreign universities

455
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:37,200
are not as good as you think.

456
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,560
Nonsense.

457
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,080
If foreign universities are no good,

458
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:42,840
why did you go for further studies?

459
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,240
If you didn't go,

460
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,000
you would never know this woman,

461
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:47,800
and our family wouldn't be like this.

462
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:48,720
Ivy.

463
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:51,480
It's not what you think.

464
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:53,800
The problem between me and your mother

465
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:56,160
does not involve anyone else.

466
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,160
It's because she and I...

467
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:57,880
Never mind.

468
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,600
I don't want to talk about your problem.

469
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:03,960
You are already divorced.

470
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,480
Nothing you say can change it.

471
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,680
I just want to know

472
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:11,160
whether you support me studying abroad.

473
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:13,440
Of course, I do.

474
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,680
But you want so much money at once.

475
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:18,360
I don't have that much right now.

476
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:19,800
Then that means no.

477
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,360
I said I'm supportive.

478
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:24,520
I am your daughter.

479
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,200
How can you support my studies without money?

480
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:28,920
With your mind?

481
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:37,080
Why didn't you ask your mother first?

482
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,280
I gave her the house and car in Shanghai,

483
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,080
and everything about the company.

484
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:43,480
She has more money than me now.

485
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:45,080
I asked her.

486
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:46,600
She said no.

487
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:47,240
If that's the case,

488
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:48,680
why do you still want to go?

489
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:50,080
Dad.

490
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,560
I didn't come all the way here

491
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:55,360
to fight with you.

492
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:59,520
The reason why my mother 
didn't allow me to study abroad

493
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:02,080
is that she's afraid that I will never come back. 
Like you did.

494
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:06,240
But didn't you tell me since I was young?

495
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,680
If you're determined to do something, 
you must stick to it.

496
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,520
I can't give up my own future

497
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:12,480
just because of her worries.

498
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:16,760
I plan to go abroad

499
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:18,280
before senior high.

500
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:20,520
I want to spend the first two years 
in a local high school

501
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:21,800
to overcome the language barrier.

502
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:23,280
And then go to university.

503
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:24,800
I know

504
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:27,120
two million RMB is not a small number.

505
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:28,960
But I did the math.

506
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,080
I do need that much.

507
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:30,760
I know.

508
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,680
I didn't demand an exorbitant price.

509
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:34,640
I know.

510
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,000
But now, I...

511
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,680
Is all your money in the hands of that woman?

512
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,680
Xiaoyu didn't control my money.

513
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:46,880
My business is not stable right now.

514
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,160
Don't lie to me.

515
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,240
That kind of woman.

516
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,080
If she doesn't control your money,

517
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,600
why would she be with you?

518
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,160
What else does she want besides money?

519
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:56,080
Ivy!

520
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,280
Don't slander her.

521
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:16,920
Ivy.

522
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:19,600
You have to trust dad.

523
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,080
I do love you.

524
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:25,480
I know.

525
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:26,720
The problem between my mother and I

526
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,360
hurt you a lot.

527
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:29,920
I feel so guilty for you.

528
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:33,480
So I will try my best

529
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,280
to meet your request,

530
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,560
OK?

531
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:40,120
I just want to study abroad.

532
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:43,280
I hope you can give me an answer.

533
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:46,200
OK.

534
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:48,240
I promise you this.

535
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,280
You can choose a school now.

536
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:52,080
Don't worry about money.

537
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:52,960
After you go abroad,

538
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,440
I will pay for your living expenses

539
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:55,680
and tuition fee.

540
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,560
What if you go back on your words halfway?

541
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:00,680
When you grow up,

542
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:02,120
have I ever failed you

543
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:03,480
on anything that I promised you?

544
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,600
Trust me.

545
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,600
I'll book you a plane ticket now.

546
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:15,440
Go back to Shanghai.

547
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,720
Don't make your mother worry.

548
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:20,520
Dad.

549
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:25,480
Do you love me or Dai Xiaoyu?

550
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:26,880
You are not a kid anymore.

551
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,240
This is a kid question.

552
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,080
I just want to know.

553
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:30,320
Those are two different things.

554
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:32,920
Different.

555
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:45,520
My phone is out of battery.

556
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:47,760
Can I borrow yours?

557
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:50,840
Here.

558
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,640
Don't you have to go to dinner with your client?

559
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:31,440
Yeah.

560
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,240
But I have to book your plane ticket first.

561
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:34,160
It's okay.

562
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:35,360
I booked one.

563
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:36,800
You can go.

564
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:40,640
Ivy.

565
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:43,040
From now on, don't travel this far

566
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:44,480
without your mother's permission.

567
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,480
OK?

568
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:47,280
Call me if you need anything.

569
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:15,840
Who is it?

570
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:19,000
Is this Dai Xiaoyu's house?

571
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:24,240
Who are you?

572
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:27,120
My name is Peng Man.

573
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:30,400
Can I help you?

574
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:32,080
You are rude.

575
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:34,200
Aren't you gonna let me in?

576
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:38,520
Change your shoes.

577
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:07,800
This house is far worse than ours.

578
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:09,640
But it's not totally bad.

579
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:11,760
At least it's clean.

580
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:16,440
It must be cleaned up by a cleaner, right?

581
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,600
You don't look like doing housework often.

582
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,000
How do you know I live here?

583
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:26,520
This is a house my dad rented.

584
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:28,960
It shouldn't be a surprise that I know it.

585
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:31,760
Did your dad let you come?

586
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:34,000
I don't think it's necessary

587
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
to get his approval for this kind of thing.

588
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:37,320
He is so busy.

589
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:40,440
You've met him.

590
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:43,000
Whether I've met him or not

591
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,360
is none of your business.

592
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:47,080
Can you ask something that 
has much to do with you?

593
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:54,080
You don't even have politeness and manners.

594
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:56,160
I don't want to talk to you.

595
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:08,280
You are prettier than I thought.

596
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:11,240
You came all the way

597
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:12,400
to compliment me?

598
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:13,480
Oh, don't take me wrong.

599
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:16,280
I just want to see the person

600
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:18,200
who made me from two-parent to single parent.

601
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,320
What does she look like?

602
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:23,040
I know why my dad

603
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:24,720
was hooked up by you.

604
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:29,240
Whatever you think.

605
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:31,800
But now listen to you,

606
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:33,360
I finally know why

607
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:35,200
your dad had to divorce your mother.

608
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:37,560
You're good at getting people to dislike you.

609
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:39,200
Just like your mother.

610
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:43,280
I know that you are a gold digger.

611
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:45,400
Do you control all my dad's money?

612
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:48,240
Hold on to it.

613
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:50,000
Don't end up losing both your man and money.

614
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:52,160
In your eyes,

615
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:54,200
your dad is so unreliable.

616
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:58,200
I'm just being kind to remind you

617
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:01,080
that he can leave me and my mom for you.

618
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:07,080
Maybe he can leave you for someone else.

619
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:09,760
Thank you for your consideration.

620
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:10,600
Laugh while you can.

621
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:13,160
You will cry someday.

622
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:21,160
You are quite talkative.

623
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:22,680
I understand now.

624
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:24,600
You are here to piss me off.

625
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:26,960
Do you think I owe it to your family?

626
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,120
Kid.

627
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:30,360
Go back home.

628
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,840
You are not the one to talk.

629
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:35,400
You can blow off all your steam at your home.

630
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:37,840
Boil the Huangpu River if you can.

631
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:38,920
That's something.

632
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:41,120
My relationship with Peng Pai

633
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:42,400
has nothing to do with anyone.

634
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:43,880
You are his daughter.

635
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:44,920
I won't shame you.

636
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,080
But only for this time.

637
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:48,880
Get out.

638
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:50,640
Are you mad?

639
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:55,240
You are mad.

640
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,200
I'm happy to see you upset.

641
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:01,080
I am happy for my mother.

642
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:06,320
Do you think you can make me angry like this?

643
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:09,560
I guess I will disappoint you.

644
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:14,920
Do you know what this is?

645
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:17,880
You...

646
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:19,040
So you do know.

647
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:20,440
I knew you would

648
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:22,360
have a baby out sooner or later.

649
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:23,760
My mom thought it a long time ago.

650
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:25,240
You two are so smart.

651
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:27,280
It's all for money anyway.

652
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:29,200
One more person means one more share.

653
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:31,880
I'm happy to see you upset.

654
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:34,600
I am happy for the baby in my belly.

655
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:37,080
I can imagine

656
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:39,280
how happy your dad will be,

657
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:40,320
if he knows.

658
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,600
Dai Xiaoyu, shame on you!

659
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:51,800
Say that again?

660
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:54,320
I will slap you.

661
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,240
Close the door.

662
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:25,160
Mom. Dad.

663
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:26,360
Look! It's the national stadium.

664
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:30,080
That's the national stadium.

665
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:31,760
It's huge!

666
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:32,360
Yeah.

667
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:32,800
Please,

668
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:34,080
drive slowly.

669
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:34,760
I want to take a photo.

670
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:36,680
Please get closer to it.

671
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,080
Look at this.

672
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:41,160
Pretty good.

673
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:43,520
Good.

674
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:29,640
I'm home.

675
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:31,240
You're home.

676
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:33,640
Wash your hands.

677
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:35,680
Dinner is almost ready.

678
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:39,600
Did you cook?

679
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:42,040
Or who else?

680
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:43,280
You?

681
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:45,520
Look at the table.

682
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:46,400
If you didn't tell me,

683
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:47,920
I would think we were robbed.

684
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,000
Huh. Man.

685
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,640
You'll see.

686
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:56,080
Come.

687
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:57,040
What?

688
00:29:59,040 --> 00:29:59,920
See?

689
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:02,360
I told you I won an award for painting.

690
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:05,680
Little painter?

691
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:09,040
You went to your granny's house for this?

692
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,560
You didn't believe me!

693
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:13,280
So I have to prove it.

694
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:17,120
Look at your painting.

695
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:17,920
Who can believe

696
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:18,920
that you've won an award?

697
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:20,360
Did you buy that award?

698
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:22,600
I'm telling you.

699
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:23,960
I'm going to put my award certificate

700
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:25,960
with my masterpiece,

701
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:27,320
as a reminder to you

702
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:28,320
that in this house

703
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:30,720
you are not the only one who can draw.

704
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:32,960
A particularly ugly painting

705
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:35,240
and a particularly worthless certificate

706
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:37,240
are hung together.

707
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:39,160
Perfect match!

708
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,000
I see you're not hungry,

709
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:42,280
I'll throw it away.

710
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:43,040
No. No. No.

711
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:44,080
I want to eat.

712
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:44,840
Your first time cooking.

713
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:46,320
I have to taste it.

714
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:48,640
Why do you have to be so mean?

715
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:49,560
I was kidding.

716
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:52,720
Today, as s gift, I got you an Eichbaum beer

717
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,080
imported with the original packaging.

718
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:56,160
Rich wheat fragrance.

719
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:57,320
Try it.

720
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:58,320
Remember.

721
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:00,600
This is my first time cooking.

722
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:01,680
Say something nice

723
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:02,480
after you taste it.

724
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:03,560
Do you hear me?

725
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:05,200
Wait for my compliment!

726
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:10,280
Try this first.

727
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:13,960
My chef cooked this for me!

728
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:21,280
How's it?

729
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:28,760
Why don't you speak?

730
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:30,880
What? Are you trying to find the word?

731
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:33,560
Did you taste it?

732
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:35,080
No.

733
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:36,760
It's was in the pot. How can I taste it?

734
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:37,880
It was hot.

735
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:39,920
Good.

736
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:41,640
I just think

737
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:43,080
it needs more salt.

738
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:56,160
It does need more salt.

739
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:58,400
I didn't add salt.

740
00:31:58,400 --> 00:31:59,040
I forgot.

741
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:00,200
Wait.

742
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:05,360
A little salt.

743
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:12,480
Can we still eat it?

744
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:16,800
It depends on how much rice you cooked.

745
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:40,160
If you don't you tell me this,

746
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:42,840
I really didn't know that

747
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:44,840
Ivy can do these things.

748
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:46,400
Well, you know now.

749
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:48,080
She is young and ignorant.

750
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:49,880
Very competitive,

751
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:50,920
like her mother.

752
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:52,600
I apologize to you on her behalf.

753
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:55,680
I'm not so narrow-minded.

754
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:56,520
I know.

755
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:58,720
Well.

756
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:01,440
Don't get upset because of a kid.

757
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:05,080
I just don't understand.

758
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:06,600
You went to meet your daughter.

759
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:09,000
Why did you tell me to meet the client?

760
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:11,080
I don't want you to worry.

761
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:13,320
A kid at that age

762
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:15,200
came all the way

763
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,720
from Shanghai to Beijing.

764
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:18,560
I didn't know what she wants.

765
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:19,560
Besides, I didn't know

766
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:21,080
if she came alone.

767
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:23,120
Are you afraid that I would

768
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:24,240
come along if you tell me the truth?

769
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:27,280
Honestly,

770
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:27,960
yes.

771
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,960
You have a strong personality.

772
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:33,280
If Ivy's mother

773
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:34,600
came with her,

774
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:36,200
how awkward it would be

775
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:37,640
when you met her.

776
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:39,160
You don't know me that well.

777
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:41,040
Anyway, I meant no harm.

778
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:42,440
Please don't be mad, okay?

779
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:45,000
I'm not mad.

780
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:48,040
You can't break a family.

781
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:49,480
Kinship fights everything.

782
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:50,360
Right?

783
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:54,400
Thank you for understanding.

784
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:55,600
Thanks.

785
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:57,480
I'm not following you.

786
00:33:58,320 --> 00:33:59,800
I feel you.

787
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:01,920
Yeah.

788
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:04,560
So,

789
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:06,080
the problem between you and your parents

790
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:07,600
needs to be solved one day.

791
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:10,159
I'm not talking about that.

792
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:11,239
What?

793
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:15,560
Mr. Chai travels a lot lately.

794
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:17,000
When he comes back next week,

795
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:19,719
I will go to him for resignation.

796
00:34:19,719 --> 00:34:20,960
Resignation?

797
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:23,159
Why?

798
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,560
Do you want to know the answer?

799
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:27,760
Yes, tell me.

800
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:56,880
No.

801
00:34:58,760 --> 00:34:59,520
No.

802
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:01,760
What no?

803
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:12,080
Xiaoyu.

804
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:16,400
We can't keep this baby.

805
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:16,920
Why?

806
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:18,680
Please calm down.

807
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:20,160
Would you listen to me?

808
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:27,120
As a father,

809
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:29,480
I think I was not good enough

810
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:31,600
to Ivy for all these years.

811
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:32,840
The most important years

812
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:33,720
in her growth,

813
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:35,000
I was not by her side.

814
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:36,440
I didn't even fulfill

815
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:38,960
the duties and responsibilities of a father.

816
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:40,920
Ivy has grown up.

817
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:43,800
She came to you today.

818
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:46,000
On the surface, it seems a conflict with you.

819
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,120
But at the root,

820
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:49,000
it's her resentment towards me.

821
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:50,840
Yes.

822
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:53,720
I divorced Ivy's mother

823
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:54,600
But,

824
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:57,680
in my mind,

825
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:59,360
I want to make it up

826
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:01,360
as much as possible for the damage caused to her

827
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:03,480
by not giving her enough love and care

828
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:05,280
in the past years.

829
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:13,400
I am a forty-two-year-old man.

830
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:15,040
If a man at my age

831
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:16,480
wants to have another child,

832
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:17,320
first,

833
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:19,600
I'll definitely not have enough energy.

834
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:21,480
Second and foremost,

835
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:23,600
Ivy may not be able to accept this.

836
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:24,080
If so,

837
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:25,280
it will make our family

838
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:27,360
extremely complicated.

839
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:28,400
Ivy. Ivy!

840
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,280
All you think about is your daughter.

841
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:31,120
Have you considered me?

842
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:31,960
I didn't ignore you.

843
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:33,360
I didn't say we should never have children.

844
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:34,600
Right?

845
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:35,880
I just want to push it off a bit.

846
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:37,520
You are still young.

847
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:37,880
Right?

848
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:38,960
When the time is right,

849
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:39,960
when Ivy can accept this,

850
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:41,360
we can think about it then.

851
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:42,400
I am young?

852
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:44,320
I am thirty years old.

853
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:46,520
Are you getting younger?

854
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:48,880
No energy at forty-two,

855
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:50,320
but full of energy at fifty-two?

856
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:50,960
Calm down.

857
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:52,080
Let's not be emotional.

858
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:53,400
Am I emotional?

859
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:55,600
At least I still have emotions.

860
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:57,000
Not as cold and ruthless as you.

861
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,160
I am calm,

862
00:36:58,160 --> 00:36:59,080
not cold.

863
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:00,760
Don't play the words with me.

864
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:04,280
The baby is here.

865
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:06,040
I'm gonna give birth to it.

866
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,520
Take responsibility if you want to.

867
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,240
Leave if you don't.

868
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:13,600
This child is mine.

869
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:16,120
It's in my body now.

870
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:18,440
I have the power to decide its life and death.

871
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:19,600
This is my child too.

872
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:20,280
I also have the power.

873
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:21,480
No, you don't.

874
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:49,440
Xiaoyu.

875
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:54,920
We are all adults, right?

876
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:56,200
Adults

877
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:59,040
should analyze things objectively and calmly

878
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:01,320
when making decisions.

879
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,240
Otherwise,

880
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:04,880
we will repeat the old mistakes.

881
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:06,560
Never be as willful as a child.

882
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:08,400
Or we will regret it.

883
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:09,480
Do you know that?

884
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:13,880
Xiaoyu. Xiaoyu!

885
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:15,400
Xiaoyu.

886
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:16,840
Listen to me.

887
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:18,680
I will contact a hospital now.

888
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:19,920
When I'm done,

889
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:22,440
we will

890
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:28,320
go to the hospital and

891
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:31,000
dispose of it.

892
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:32,560
Then we get married.

893
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:33,680
When the time is right,

894
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:34,920
and everything is settled,

895
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:35,920
I promise,

896
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:38,720
I promise we will have

897
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:40,200
a child of our own.

898
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:41,800
OK?

899
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:43,520
It's okay.

900
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:46,200
It's okay.

901
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:49,160
It's okay, Xiaoyu.

902
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:57,200
Peng Pai.

903
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:00,560
In your daughter's eyes,

904
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:02,160
you are an unreliable man.

905
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:05,280
She seems to know you better than I do.

906
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:21,800
I finally know what kind of person you are.

907
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:25,440
But I tell you,

908
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:28,240
I don't accept.

909
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:29,760
I don't accept a man

910
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:32,040
who keeps saying that he loves me

911
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:34,760
but let me get rid of his child.

912
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:37,480
I don't accept the person I love

913
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:41,000
telling me to kill his child.

914
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:45,040
I am deserted by my family because of you.

915
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:48,240
And now you are asking me to get an abortion?

916
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:49,920
I don't accept!

917
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:51,120
No!

918
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:58,480
Xiaoyu.

919
00:39:58,480 --> 00:39:59,720
Let go of me!

920
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:00,320
Stop!

921
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:01,560
Stop that!

922
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:02,680
You said I don't think about you!

923
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:03,920
Have you thought about me?

924
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:04,920
Look.

925
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:06,200
Listen to me.

926
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:07,520
Let's not settle this now.

927
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:08,320
You think about it.

928
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:09,400
And we can make a decision then, OK?

929
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:10,520
OK?

930
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:12,400
Don't follow me.

931
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:14,840
I will kill myself if you follow me!

932
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:16,520
Xiaoyu.
