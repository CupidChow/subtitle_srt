I know,

153
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,800
when it comes to relationships,

154
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,240
if you can't figure it out,

155
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,800
whatever we say is useless.

156
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,200
But I want to remind you that

157
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,960
if you like him, fight for him.

158
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,840
Don't always care about self-esteem and shame.

Take me and Zhao Henan as an example.

If he didn't take the initiative

00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,040
and I didn't make a move,

162
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,760
then maybe we wouldn't get married.

who takes the initiative?

168
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:47,880
Now between me and him,

169
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:49,400
it's not about who takes the initiative.

170
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,760
It's about whether it's necessary.

171
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,560
Then you just ask yourself a question:

172
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:57,760
do you still love him?

173
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:59,360
If yes, fight for him.

174
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,160
If no,

175
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:01,840
just drop it.

Are you giving a lesson to her?

177
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:05,840
Xue.

178
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:06,720
Thank you.

179
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:09,480
Wait,

180
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:10,920
where were we?

181
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,400
You were saying,

182
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,200
"just drop it."

183
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,000
Yeah.

184
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,640
Yes or no. Choose one.

185
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:19,640
Are you trying to pay tribute to your single life?

186
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:20,720
Chef Zhao.

187
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:21,480
Feng Xi can't drink.

188
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,440
You drink with me.

189
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,400
I can't drink, either.

190
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,480
I drove here.

191
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:27,840
You are two people.

192
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,200
Can't you let Feng Xi drive?

193
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:29,920
Drink with me.

194
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:30,640
Well.

195
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:31,800
Don't let him drink.

196
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:32,800
He can't drink much.

197
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,320
When you are satisfied,

198
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,800
he probably needs to have his stomach pumped.

199
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:39,360
Oh, I see.

200
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,640
Trying to get pregnant.

201
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:41,920
OK. Fine.

202
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:43,760
What?

203
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,880
Why are you telling them about everything?

204
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,080
That's okay.

205
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,480
It's nothing to be ashamed of.

206
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:55,600
Oh my god!

207
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,320
What?

208
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:57,720
I should just go.

209
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:58,880
I'll take a taxi.

210
00:09:58,880 --> 00:09:59,920
We can drive you home.

211
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:00,720
It's so cold.

212
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:01,400
No, thanks.

213
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:03,720
I've seen enough of that.

214
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,000
You continue to breed your

215
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,400
four-legged gold swallowing beast.

216
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:08,160
Bye.

217
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:09,720
Bye.

218
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:12,480
What swallowing beast?

219
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:13,880
She means child.

220
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,680
Four-legged gold swallowing beast.

221
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:19,840
Sounds about right.

222
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,240
What do you mean?

223
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:42,360
Yu Songyang.

224
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,360
You promised me.

225
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,400
Remember?

226
00:10:58,680 --> 00:10:59,760
You went back on your word!

227
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:00,760
Are you aware?

228
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,800
If you quit the job,

229
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:11,000
I'll cancel my ticket tomorrow right now.

230
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,120
Fine.

231
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:18,680
Good luck.

232
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,320
Hello, sis.

233
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:56,920
Are you asleep?

234
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,440
Could you come to my place now?

235
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,520
I'm at home.

236
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:11,560
Sweetie.

237
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:13,120
Why don't you sleep?

238
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:13,880
One sec.

239
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,600
You want to buy a house?

240
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:20,560
Yeah.

241
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:28,880
Look.

242
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:31,960
This apartment is big.

243
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,240
But the location is bad.

244
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:34,720
This one is well-located.

245
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,120
But it's small.

246
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,440
The total prices are about the same.

247
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:38,600
I

248
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:39,680
tend to choose

249
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:41,520
the well-located one.

250
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,240
If we choose this one,

251
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,960
we need to apply for this much mortgage.

252
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:49,400
Twenty years.

253
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:50,840
We pay off this much every month.

254
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,000
Mortgage plus car loan.

255
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:53,000
Just over 20,000 in total.

256
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,280
I think I can make it.

257
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:57,920
Why so rush to buy a house?

258
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:59,440
A house makes a home.

259
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,880
A house makes a home.

260
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,680
Although it's a bit small,

261
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,520
it's our home.

262
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:12,840
Wonderful.

263
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:14,760
A few days ago,

264
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:17,040
my relative said he is going to come back to China.

265
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,240
We can't live here anymore.

266
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:21,840
Then we

267
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,440
don't have to rent a house.

268
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,280
You want me over in the middle of the night

269
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:59,640
to watch you perform mime?

270
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,040
Sis,

271
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,600
I think we are really over this time.

272
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,400
Do you want to break up?

273
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:11,040
Then why did you take the job?

274
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,160
No man wants to

275
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:15,280
watch his girlfriend make a nude scene.

276
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:20,120
Yu Songyang was just being normal.

277
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,480
I know you so well.

278
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:25,840
You are just getting in a rage.

279
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:27,200
You have to take this job.

280
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,640
I really believe

281
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:31,240
this is a character that can show my acting skills.

282
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:34,800
You can't perform your acting skills 
without taking off your clothes?

283
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,560
Then don't be an actress.

284
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:38,720
In foreign countries,

285
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,000
there are tons of actors who can do nude scenes.

286
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:43,080
The judges won't give you an award

287
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:44,160
just for being nude.

288
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:45,000
In our country,

289
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,320
cinemas may not dare to show those nude scenes.

290
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:49,040
In the end, you'll lose your boyfriend.

291
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,440
And you don't get to be in movies.

292
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:53,480
Don't you understand that?

293
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,520
When did you become an exhibitionist?

294
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:02,240
He didn't come to coax me.

295
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:57,800
Hello.

296
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,240
Hi.

297
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:10,200
To the south station.

298
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:21,720
Xue.

299
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,280
Director.

300
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:25,480
I adjusted the shooting order.

301
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:27,400
We'll shoot scene 35 in a while.

302
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:28,320
Scene 35!

303
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,560
I'm not ready yet.

304
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:33,120
I want you to be unprepared.

305
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,960
Haven't you seen the actor yet?

306
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:36,920
That's right.

307
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:38,680
I want that strangeness.

308
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:40,440
If you meet the actor

309
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:41,280
and get acquainted,

310
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:43,400
you'll have to act this strangeness.

311
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:44,000
OK?

312
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,280
I want you to show it naturally.

313
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:46,560
OK.

314
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:47,080
Good.

315
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:47,960
When the lights are ready,

316
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:48,720
we'll shoot.

317
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,400
I am your boyfriend

318
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,440
and maybe your future husband.

319
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,839
I don't want you to do such a scene.

320
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:17,839
OK?

321
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:19,319
I am a professional actress.

322
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:42,280
OK. Let me introduce you guys.

323
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,720
This is the hero.

324
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:44,520
This is the heroine.

325
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:45,560
Hello.

326
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:47,560
Our first shot

327
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:49,400
will follow the male lead

328
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,800
slowly crawling in from this window.

329
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:52,360
After you enter this room,

330
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:54,040
take a look around.

331
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:55,240
At this moment,

332
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,840
you hear the sound of water inside.

333
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:58,520
You come this way.

334
00:17:58,520 --> 00:17:59,000
And the machine

335
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,520
will follow your back.

336
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:02,880
You walk here

337
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,080
and open this door quietly.

338
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:07,000
Then you lean in.

339
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:07,960
Now.

340
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:08,520
Bao Xue.

341
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,560
You'll be taking a shower here.

342
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:11,600
OK.

343
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,720
You hear something.

344
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,800
Then you suddenly turn around and ask,

345
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:17,760
"Who is it?"

346
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:18,760
Who is it?

347
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:19,560
Yes.

348
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:20,400
Then...

349
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:21,520
Well?

350
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:22,680
Director.

351
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:23,800
Isn't this scene

352
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:26,080
only shooting my back?

353
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,440
If I suddenly turn around

354
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:28,920
and say the line,

355
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:29,760
then my front

356
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:31,560
will be totally exposed.

357
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,000
In real life,

358
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,080
when you're taking a shower,

359
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:36,560
if you hear something outside,

360
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,040
you have to wrap yourself

361
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:39,240
in a bath towel first,

362
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,360
and then check

363
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:41,480
what's happening outside,

364
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:42,920
right?

365
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:43,400
Right.

366
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:44,680
That's how we will do it.

367
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:47,160
Well.

368
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:47,960
Director.

369
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,640
Can you help me with this?

370
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:50,440
Could you edit

371
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:51,960
this scene?

372
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:52,760
Please?

373
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,560
I designed to do it in one take.

374
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,320
If I edit,

375
00:18:58,600 --> 00:18:59,840
it'll be tacky.

376
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:05,760
Come on.

377
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:06,960
Clear the set.

378
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:07,560
Clear.

379
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:08,640
Let's give it a go.

380
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:09,360
Come on.

381
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:10,800
Everybody, out.

382
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:11,880
Let's go through it.

383
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:12,840
Go through it.

384
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:14,600
Here comes the machine.

385
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:18,280
Everybody quiet.

386
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:19,400
Quiet.

387
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:20,200
Ready?

388
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,520
Director!

389
00:19:28,160 --> 00:22:27,240
[Extreme sport: do not imitate.]

390
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:19,720
Songyang.

391
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:20,800
OK.

392
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:34,360
Slack!

393
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:47,840
Conquer it for me.

394
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:28,400
Life is about

395
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:30,800
pursuing happiness.

396
00:22:30,560 --> 00:23:08,600
[Extreme sport: do not imitate.]

397
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:41,640
Down!

398
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:24,080
Xue.

399
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:26,680
You are right.

400
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:30,760
Life is about pursuing happiness.

401
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:49,200
I quit.

402
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:52,720
I miss you.

403
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:05,360
I'm really sorry, director.

404
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:08,520
I will return the deposit to you today.

405
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,960
I can even make compensation to you.

406
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:22,680
All right.

407
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,000
I won't make it hard for you.

408
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,360
I'm truly sorry.

409
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:29,520
So sorry.

410
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:34,640
I understand.

411
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:36,800
Thank you.

412
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,560
Remember to invite me to your wedding.

413
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:54,080
Thank you.

414
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,600
Zhao Henan wants you.

415
00:24:58,600 --> 00:24:59,440
OK.

416
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:02,960
Welcome.

417
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:06,680
What?

418
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:08,960
The Purjoy salad dressing

419
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:10,400
is almost our shop's signature.

420
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,760
Do you just want me to compliment you?

421
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:13,640
I'm busy out there.

422
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:15,760
No. I want to say that

423
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:17,600
let's go see the house after work.

424
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:20,840
Wouldn't that be too late?

425
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,040
The house-owners said they can wait for us.

426
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:23,720
Really?

427
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:24,440
Hmm.

428
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:25,600
OK.

429
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:27,360
Is that all?

430
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,280
You can tell me after work.

431
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:29,840
Well.

432
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:30,360
Wait.

433
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:34,200
Give this to table three.

434
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:34,960
It's on me.

435
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:39,080
Who?

436
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:41,680
The house-owners.

437
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:44,320
OK.

438
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:44,800
OK.

439
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:52,240
This house is 80 square meters.

440
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:53,760
Two bedrooms upstairs.

441
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:54,960
A living room downstairs.

442
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:56,480
We haven't lived in this house

443
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,440
since it was done last year.

444
00:25:58,120 --> 00:25:58,840
Why?

445
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,360
My wife was pregnant.

446
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:03,680
My mother was worried about formaldehyde.

447
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:05,000
She let us live with her so she could

448
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,200
take care of my wife.

449
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:09,000
I need capital

450
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:09,880
for my business now.

451
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:11,600
So I decided to sell it.

452
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:16,440
Furniture and appliances

453
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:18,320
are all branded.

454
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:19,360
We planned to live here,

455
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:20,600
so,

456
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:21,560
we got quality stuff.

457
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,280
You guys

458
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:25,680
can move in with a toothbrush.

459
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:27,560
Isn't that nice?

460
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:28,040
Yeah.

461
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:28,920
Look.

462
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:29,680
Can you give us

463
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:31,280
a better price?

464
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,000
Dude.

465
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,360
Sorry, I really can't.

466
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:37,880
This apartment

467
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:39,600
cost me 300,000 RMB on decoration alone.

468
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:42,440
I know it's not easy for you to stay in Beijing.

469
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:43,680
I'm giving you

470
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:44,520
the best price.

471
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:46,960
Today at your restaurant,

472
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:49,120
I see you two are reliable people.

473
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,400
My apartment

474
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,120
will be in good hands.

475
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:56,440
So?

476
00:26:58,880 --> 00:26:59,560
Good.

477
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:00,240
Then should we buy it?

478
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,000
OK.

479
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,040
It's settled.

480
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:04,880
Thank you.

481
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:06,920
Great.

482
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:08,200
We have a house.

483
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:36,640
Hei didn't want me to tell you this.

484
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:39,600
I don't understand.

485
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,360
Why is it so fast?

486
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:42,840
It's not, actually.

487
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:44,920
Hei was being uncooperative.

488
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:51,280
He said he didn't want to lie in the hospital bed

489
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:52,400
and drift through life.

490
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:54,200
Can't even use the toilet on his own.

491
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:55,320
Living like that

492
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:56,240
is dehumanizing.

493
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,200
Is there any other way?

494
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:59,160
Or if we

495
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:00,720
find some targeted drugs?

496
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:01,720
It's too late.

497
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:03,280
Lungs and rectum.

498
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:04,880
Double primary malignant tumor.

499
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:05,760
Cancer has spread to

500
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:06,600
his thoracic spine,

501
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:07,080
lumbar spine,

502
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:07,920
and pelvis.

503
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:10,360
There are signs of 
spreading to the lymph at any time.

504
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:14,160
Based on your experience,

505
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:16,640
how...

506
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,400
how long does he have?

507
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:22,120
Optimistically,

508
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:23,920
a year.

509
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:25,920
Pessimistically,

510
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:28,120
any time.

511
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:34,560
Well.

512
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:35,960
Does he know that you come to me?

513
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:39,200
Shanshan.

514
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:41,040
Take my word.

515
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:43,880
It's better not to let him notice

516
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:45,800
that you already know about this.

517
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:47,080
Otherwise,

518
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:48,560
he will be under even greater pressure.

519
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:50,080
I have known him for more than 30 years.

520
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:52,000
Dignity means

521
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,160
the world to him.

522
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:57,480
I know. Don't worry.

523
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:00,440
Thanks.

524
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:02,680
Pleasure.

525
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:05,520
I'll have an operation later.

526
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:06,520
I have to go.

527
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:07,480
Be strong.

528
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:09,320
Strong.

529
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:20,000
Hello?

530
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:21,240
Xiaoyu.

531
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:22,680
I'm here.

532
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:25,320
Just off the plane.

533
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:26,360
OK.

534
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:28,200
See you later.

535
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:47,880
Where are you going?

536
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:48,920
To meet a friend.

537
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:50,160
Then I'll go to the company.

538
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:52,680
You haven't recovered yet.

539
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:54,000
Why so rush to work?

540
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:55,800
I've recuperated for more than two months.

541
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:56,880
All good.

542
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:58,480
The company keeps my job for me

543
00:30:58,480 --> 00:30:59,800
and pays me a salary.

544
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:00,920
I have to show up at least.

545
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:02,560
That's true.

546
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:06,120
Fasten the buttons.

547
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:08,440
You should wear layers.

548
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:09,880
It's cold outside.

549
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:11,240
I know.

550
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:13,720
Today is the winter solstice.

551
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:15,760
We'll have dumplings tonight.

552
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:18,120
I have dinner plans with Liu Liangzhou.

553
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:19,560
Bring him here.

554
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:22,280
Xue and Yu will come, too.

555
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:23,840
All right.

556
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,120
I'm off.

557
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:26,160
OK.

558
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:26,880
Bye, grandma.

559
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:27,440
OK.

560
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:28,400
Bye-bye.

561
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:29,240
Take care.

562
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:29,800
OK.

563
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:51,760
Xiaoyu.

564
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,800
I missed you!

565
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:02,120
How's it going?

566
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:03,640
Is Beijing cold for you?

567
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:05,520
Do you forget where I came back from?

568
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:06,480
Is Beijing colder

569
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:07,640
than Norway?

570
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:09,000
Sure.

571
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:11,360
How are you?

572
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:12,360
Do you feel better now?

573
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:13,560
I'm all right.

574
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:14,840
I can eat and sleep well.

575
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,160
What about your love life?

576
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:19,200
Well.

577
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:21,360
It's okay.

578
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,480
He is a good boyfriend.

579
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:26,800
But I always feel weird between the two of us.

580
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:28,600
Are we in a relationship or are we not?

581
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:30,680
Whatever.

582
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:32,360
Never mind.

583
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:33,080
I'll shut up.

584
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:34,920
Or you'll call me a baby.

585
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:35,960
OK.

586
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:37,080
I won't ask.

587
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:39,560
How is work?

588
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:41,480
Don't mention it.

589
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,160
I have been off for months.

590
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:44,280
And they still pay me salary.

591
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:45,960
I'm all ashamed.

592
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:48,200
I was going to the company today.

593
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,600
But you came back.

594
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,400
I must meet you first.

595
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:53,160
Let's talk about you.

596
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:54,520
Why did you come back suddenly?

597
00:32:58,760 --> 00:32:59,880
Something happened at home.

598
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:02,040
I am back here to deal with it.

599
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:06,400
You seem worried.

600
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:07,120
What's wrong?

601
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:09,840
I'm just tired.

602
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:12,080
It was

603
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:13,280
a long flight.

604
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:14,760
Also, I'm still jet-lagged.

605
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:16,760
Are you in a hurry to go back?

606
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:17,400
No.

607
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:18,480
Listen to me.

608
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,800
Go home and get a sound sleep.

609
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:22,200
I'll treat you to dinner tomorrow.

610
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:23,760
Okay.

611
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:26,080
Are you sure you're okay?

612
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:28,400
You don't seem well to me.

613
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:30,800
Why would I lie to you?

614
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:31,680
I'm fine.

615
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:32,640
Alright.

616
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,080
Then, it's a date.

617
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:35,320
See you at dinner tomorrow.

618
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,080
I'll text you the location later.

619
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:40,560
I am telling you the truth.

620
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:42,080
They're not stories.

621
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:43,680
Over the past few weeks,

622
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:45,360
I've been meeting them all by myself.

623
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:48,960
I love listening to your stories.

624
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:50,600
Then, I'll tell you another one.

625
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:52,120
Do you remember the client from Fujian?

626
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:54,000
He came the other day.

627
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:54,920
He brought two bottles

628
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:56,560
of great wine.

629
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:58,320
I've never heard of the brand.

630
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:00,200
It tasted soft

631
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:01,800
and the aftertaste was intense.

632
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,200
I was tipsy after two glasses.

633
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:05,800
Do you know how much he could drink?

634
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:07,920
He drank a 40 ml. glass of wine

635
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:09,560
down in one.

636
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:11,120
How could I keep up with him?

637
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:11,679
Two glasses,

638
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:12,719
and I got tipsy.

639
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:14,000
Then, I left some wine in my glass every time.

640
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,400
I just left it there.

641
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:16,199
He saw it.

642
00:34:16,199 --> 00:34:17,320
Do you know what he said?

643
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:18,280
"Mr. Chai.

644
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:19,880
You can waste life.

645
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:21,280
But you can't waste good wine."

646
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:24,199
Do you know?

647
00:34:24,199 --> 00:34:25,520
At that moment, all I could think about

648
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:27,639
was how much I missed you.

649
00:34:27,639 --> 00:34:28,800
If you were there,

650
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,520
you'd have defeated them all.

651
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:32,639
So, you missed me

652
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:34,400
'cause I could drink for you?

653
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:36,360
Not just that.

654
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:37,679
Xiaoyu, you see.

655
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:38,679
You can drink

656
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:39,560
and

657
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:40,679
you still have a clear mind

658
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:42,239
after you drink.

659
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:43,880
Whatever tricks they play

660
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:44,960
and whatever traps they're setting up,

661
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,639
you can see them all.

662
00:34:47,159 --> 00:34:48,800
This is your strength.

663
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:49,840
I can't do that.

664
00:34:50,199 --> 00:34:50,880
I am a boss.

665
00:34:51,239 --> 00:34:51,760
I have

666
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:52,400
to drink.

667
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:53,560
But if I do,

668
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:54,400
I can't think straight.

669
00:34:55,159 --> 00:34:56,040
That day,

670
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:56,920
after drinking,

671
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:58,840
they showed me a contract.

672
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:00,400
I

673
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:01,600
didn't know what had gotten into me,

674
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:02,960
but before I even realized it,

675
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:03,960
I was holding it

676
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:04,720
and staring at it.

677
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:05,640
I was reading it

678
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:06,800
word by word.

679
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:07,880
You used to do that for me.

680
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:09,320
I was staring at it

681
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:11,280
and spotted a problem.

682
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:14,280
The payment date

683
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:15,520
was

684
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:17,040
extended by a month.

685
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:18,960
They were trying to get me to sign it

686
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:19,840
while I was drunk.

687
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:20,920
They were tricking me.

688
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:24,200
How embarrassed that must have been!

689
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:25,640
What did you do?

690
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:26,960
I told them straight away!

691
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:31,920
Honesty is a must for any business.

692
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:34,480
If the wine is no good, then get another bottle.

693
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:37,120
If the partner is not honest,
 then cooperate with others.

694
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:38,880
Doing business

695
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:41,240
is all about integrity.

696
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,080
We are businessmen.

697
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:45,080
They just got my point after hearing me say this.

698
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:45,960
They

699
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:47,200
took out another contract immediately.

700
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:49,080
"Mr. Chai. It's a mistake.

701
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:51,760
This is the right one."

702
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:53,920
They were sly.

703
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:54,640
See?

704
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:57,200
Have a look.

705
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:58,200
What do you think?

706
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:01,960
You made quite a fortune!

707
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:04,800
Seems that you can

708
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,880
make it on your own after I left.

709
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,200
Dai Xiaoyu.

710
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:10,880
I

711
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:13,280
need to start getting used to

712
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:14,480
life

713
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:15,680
without you.

714
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:19,360
I have recovered.

715
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:21,200
I can come back to work any minute now.

716
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:22,120
Xiaoyu.

717
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:23,520
I asked you here today

718
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:24,960
to talk to you about something serious.

719
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:27,800
I'm all ears.

720
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:29,600
Recently,

721
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:31,360
there has been

722
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:32,520
someone trying to poach you.

723
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:33,640
Who is it?

724
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:34,360
Let me finish.

725
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:36,760
As far as I'm concerned,

726
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:37,600
I won't

727
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:38,680
allow it.

728
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:41,640
Although it hasn't been a year

729
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:42,520
since you joined us,

730
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:43,600
I do feel that

731
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:44,560
you are

732
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:45,600
trustworthy.

733
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:47,400
When I got home,

734
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:49,040
I told my wife

735
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,160
about it.

736
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:51,480
Do you know what she said?

737
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:53,840
"Chai,

738
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:57,480
it's a crime that you force

739
00:36:57,480 --> 00:37:00,840
Dai Xiaoyu to work for you."

740
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:05,160
You are now singing my praise

741
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:07,680
with these meaningless words.

742
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:10,080
I know that

743
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:11,760
a company operates according to

744
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:13,120
certain plans and schemes.

745
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:15,000
You've been kind enough to me.

746
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:16,680
It's okay.

747
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:17,600
I will respect

748
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:18,520
any decisions you make.

749
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:19,880
It's not what you think.

750
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:21,920
My company is doing great.

751
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:23,640
Nobody is getting laid off.

752
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:24,480
Dai Xiaoyu.

753
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:27,040
I am just putting myself in your shoes.

754
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:28,280
With your educational background

755
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:29,240
and your competence,

756
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:30,080
you can do

757
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,040
much better than this job.

758
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:34,800
It's not about making money.

759
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,160
I just think

760
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:37,640
you should

761
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:40,000
take a further step in your career.

762
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,640
So, I have given my permission.

763
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:45,560
But it's up to you.

764
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:49,200
Who on earth is this someone?

765
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:50,680
It's someone you know.

766
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:56,800
Ms. Hua?

767
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:59,440
You're so clever.

768
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:03,160
I don't know.

769
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:05,120
I am not that good.

770
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:06,560
Don't be so hasty.

771
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:09,000
Think about it.

772
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,280
This is something huge.

773
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,560
When you think it through,

774
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:13,760
call Ms. Hua.

775
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:15,440
She's been waiting to hear from you.

776
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,760
It's late.

777
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:22,720
I'll pack the rest.

778
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:23,840
I'll drive you back.

779
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:25,760
Do you have a new toothbrush here?

780
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:27,640
I...

781
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:29,080
I am not going back tonight.

782
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:31,680
I think we should break up.

783
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:33,960
I love you.

784
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:37,680
This will be the last time I say it to you.

785
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:40,440
You helped me

786
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:42,120
convince Peihong to work at our company

787
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:43,320
and gave 10%

788
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:44,880
of your shares

789
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:45,760
to her.

790
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:46,480
Truth be told,

791
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:48,000
you're so generous.

792
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:50,280
Sorry, guys.

793
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:51,760
I gotta go.

794
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:52,760
I'll see you out.

795
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:54,400
It's okay. Stay.

796
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:55,800
You're seriously leaving?

797
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:57,440
Do you really think it's nothing

798
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:59,400
from a man's perspective?

799
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:01,160
Shen Peihong and I broke up years ago.

800
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:02,200
And we will never

801
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:03,960
get back together.

802
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:05,240
Don't tell me that.

803
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:06,720
Explain it to her when you go back.
