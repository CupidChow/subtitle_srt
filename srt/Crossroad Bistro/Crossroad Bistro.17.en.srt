What do you want?

7
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:16,079
There is a problem with your marriage.

8
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,200
I think

9
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,000
if a man

10
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:21,680
has done nasty things,

11
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,560
he should not pretend to be a gentleman,

12
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,720
just be nasty all the way.

13
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,640
That's a cool persona.

Persona.

15
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,760
Do you know what a persona is?

16
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,560
It's personality

and breeding.

18
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,760
You have a vulgar personality,

and poor breeding.

Look at how miserable you are right now.

Now you are talking about feathers?

You are born to be a mother.

96

and can achieve a great cause.

Didn't you feel bitter?

Of course, I did.

I can cook you a meal.

104

I never cook.

105
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:00,720
If you are hungry,

I'm not hungry.

108
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,720
Now, only housework

109
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,360
can distract me.

00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,159
What do you want to eat?

111
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:38,880
I want...

Tomato and Egg Noodles.

113

Turn on the microwave.

00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,560
OK. Go play.

Let's order takeaway.

145
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:04,800
OK?

146
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,480
So we can all have what we want.

147
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,000
OK.

148
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,080
Rest assured.

I'll order now.

150

You really don't take a bite?

151
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,360
Your husband cheated,

152
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:42,200
but you are punishing yourself with a fast.

If I were a man,

I would marry you.

00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:54,440
Please don't make it worse.

157
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:08,080
You've stayed with me for less than two hours,

158
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,960
yet you checked your watch eight times in total.

159
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,960
It feels like twenty years.

Have you finished your homework?

163
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,400
Then when you finish your dinner,

164
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:28,360
take a bath and go to bed.

165

I don't want to take a bath by myself.

00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:33,120
I want to wait for mommy to give me a shower.

167
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:33,920
If mommy doesn't come back,

168
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,120
you won't take a shower?

169
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,720
What if she doesn't come back forever?

170
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:40,560
Why would she do that?

171
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:41,800
I said, what if.

172
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,440
I don't want that.

You have to learn to
 take a bath by yourself, Yuanyuan.

00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:51,880
I don't want to!

177
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,800
I want mommy to give me a bath.

178
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:55,920
I don't want to do it by myself!

179
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,960
I don't want anybody else!

180
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,120
You take a bath by yourself today.

181
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,200
No going to bed before a shower.

182
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,200
No!

183
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,920
I want mommy!

184
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,920
I want mommy!

185
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,640
I want mommy!

186
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,320
She is a lot.

187
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:14,840
Dad.

188
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:15,400
Don't ask me.

189
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:16,360
I know nothing.

190
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,280
Are there more fries?

191
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,320
If you want to stay over,

192
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,800
go take a bath.

193
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,080
If you are worried about your kids,

194
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:40,320
go home immediately.

195
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,200
Standing awake in the middle of the night.

196
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:43,800
What are you? An owl?

197
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,880
I can't sleep.

198
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,000
That's good.

199
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:50,480
Go home now.

200
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,600
Interrogate Du Shijun.

201
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,000
Ask him if he is just having an affair

202
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,360
or he wants a divorce.

203
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,040
If I see him,

204
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:56,960
I'll feel sick.

205
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,200
That is your home.

206
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,120
Your kids.

207
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,080
Your house.

208
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,200
If you feel sick,

209
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,200
ask him to go away!

210
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:03,240
I've never heard that

211
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:05,200
people who did nothing wrong kick themselves out.

212
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,240
And your phone.

213
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:06,880
Turn it on.

214
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:07,880
No.

215
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:10,280
You have to know his attitude.

216
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:11,520
I don't care

217
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:12,600
about his attitude.

218
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,080
Playing hard?

219
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,080
Password?

220
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,440
Hurry up.

221
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,440
What did he say?

222
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:32,400
Where are you going?

223
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,520
Yuanyuan had an accident.

224
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:34,520
Don't drive.

225
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:35,320
I'll drive you there.

226
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,600
Wait for me to change.

227
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,280
Hello.

228
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:56,440
Has a child named Du Yuanyuan

229
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:57,400
been sent over just now?

230
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:58,280
Go straight and turn right.

231
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:59,040
She's having gastric lavage.

232
00:12:59,040 --> 00:12:59,840
Okay. Thank you.

233
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:05,920
Where have you been?

234
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:06,640
What happened?

235
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:07,840
Yuanyuan swallowed

236
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:08,760
his brother's toy.

237
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:09,680
A toy?

238
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,280
How big?

239
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,160
Just a small piece.

240
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,440
Yuanyuan insisted on

241
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:15,240
playing with Zhuang's toy.

242
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,000
They fought over it.

243
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,320
Yuanyuan took it and stuffed it in her mouth.

244
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,440
Zhuang ran after her

245
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,440
and pushed her.

246
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,600
Yuanyuan fell over

247
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:21,280
and swallowed it.

248
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:22,720
Good baby-sitting!

249
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,120
What the hell were you doing?

250
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:24,800
I...

251
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:25,800
Quiet, please.

252
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,400
I looked away for one second.

253
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:27,960
I...

254
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:28,920
Of course.

255
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:30,960
How can you still see us now?

256
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,800
What are you talking about?

257
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:33,720
Where is Zhuang?

258
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:34,440
I left him at home.

259
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:35,120
What can he do here?

260
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:35,920
Make a mess?

261
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,200
Lef...

262
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:39,200
You left him at home alone?

263
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:40,720
You go home and take care of him now.

264
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:41,960
Why are you yelling at me?

265
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:42,680
I haven't asked you yet.

266
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:43,200
Oh crap.

267
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:43,640
Look at this.

268
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:44,400
You should be yelled at!

269
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,120
Where have you been?

270
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:45,960
Your phone was off.

271
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:46,520
I was dead!

272
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:47,360
Patient's family.

273
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,120
What are you arguing?

274
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:51,360
This is the hospital. Go home and fight.

275
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,400
Sorry.

276
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,000
How is Du Yuanyuan now?

277
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:56,280
She is fine now.

278
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:57,920
The toy has been vomited out.

279
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,240
She must eat liquid food at home for two days.

280
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:01,760
Pay attention to her.

281
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:02,800
Sure. Thank you.

282
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:10,560
Zhuang. Put down the phone.

283
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:11,960
Go back to your room to sleep.

284
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,880
We'll talk about this tomorrow.

285
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:15,280
Come here.

286
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:15,920
Now.

287
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:31,160
You scared mommy to death today.

288
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:31,760
Do you know that?

289
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:33,360
Mommy.

290
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:35,320
Don't go.

291
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:37,280
Could you please stay?

292
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:38,160
Mommy won't go.

293
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:41,000
I'll read you the story of the little white cat.

294
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:41,720
OK?

295
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:42,520
Umm.

296
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:45,880
Ready?

297
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:53,880
The little girl said

298
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:57,000
the little white cat doesn't have mommy anymore.

299
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,120
It's still raining outside.

300
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:03,840
If we take it back again,

301
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,320
it'll die in the rain.

302
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:08,840
Let's keep it.

303
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:11,760
Her mommy was quiet for a moment.

304
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:16,760
She touched the little 
white cat's head with her hand.

305
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:20,840
The little white cat purred

306
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,960
and rubbed her head against her mother's hand.

307
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:25,880
The mother grinned.

308
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:28,360
"What a cute little thing." She said.

309
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,600
Do I have no name?

310
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,720
Don't you usually call me that?

311
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:50,400
What a life.

312
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,360
I lost my soul

313
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:53,680
and my name.

314
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:58,080
I don't understand.

315
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,600
What exactly happened?

316
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:02,000
You just threw a bomb here.

317
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:03,680
And I was blown up.

318
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:04,680
Even if I die,

319
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:06,160
I have to know the reason.

320
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:07,360
What did I do

321
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,960
that made you so mad at me?

322
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:15,920
You never really

323
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,560
listen to what I say.

324
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:21,680
I have said everything I can say.

325
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:23,280
I don't want to talk to you anymore.

326
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:25,760
You know perfectly

327
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:27,120
what you've done to me

328
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:28,320
and to this family.

329
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:30,560
Do you really need me to remind you?

330
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:33,040
Please give me a hint.

331
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,360
I have absolutely no idea.

332
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:37,920
What have I done wrong

333
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:38,760
to make you upset?

334
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,160
Even if I am guilty of a crime,

335
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:43,600
you'll need to publicize 
the reason for your judgment.

336
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:49,840
Publicize. Huh?

337
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:20,119
What is this?

338
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:22,680
Where did you get that?

339
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:27,240
How is this possible?

340
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:28,640
It...

341
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,240
I've never!

342
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:30,920
That's fake!

343
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:31,800
How could I be with her?

344
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,920
I talked to this woman named Wei Lan.

345
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:35,640
What?

346
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:37,280
What have you talked to her?

347
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:39,040
Nothing happened between me and her!

348
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:40,120
Nothing needs to be talked about!

349
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:41,440
Then what's with this photo?

350
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,240
How do I know?

351
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,200
How did she have my phone number?

352
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,120
I don't know!

353
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,000
I...

354
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,480
I swear to god.

355
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:50,920
I know nothing about this!

356
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:52,480
I knew I was framed!

357
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,920
Du Shijun, do you still have a conscience?

358
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:58,440
Let's not fight.

359
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:00,640
Let's figure this out first, okay?

360
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:01,480
I won't give you a chance,

361
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:03,360
even if you want to fight.

362
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,120
You don't deserve it.

363
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:08,880
Si Meng.

364
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,880
How can I fall in love with someone else?

365
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:13,200
Why should I fall in love with someone else?

366
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,280
I am someone else in your eyes.

367
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:30,440
What do you want?

368
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:32,280
What do I want?

369
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:33,800
What can I do?

370
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,600
Will you even listen to me?

371
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:39,680
Ridiculous.

372
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:12,400
The love that once soul-stirring

373
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,800
has been buried by your own hands.

374
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:17,640
Don't say stuff like that.

375
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:20,960
Safely passed the seven-year itch,

376
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,120
I thought there is nothing more to worry about.

377
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:27,440
I didn't expect the nine-year tribulation.

378
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:30,440
I always feel like

379
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:32,360
I'm not your wife.

380
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:37,600
You want me to spoil you like a mother.

381
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:40,880
Do you have the obedience of a son?

382
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:44,240
You want me to respect you like a father.

383
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:46,680
Do you shoulder the responsibilities of a dad?

384
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:53,120
When did you become so vicious?

385
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,520
It's totally groundless.

386
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:57,200
If you put it that way,

387
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,360
it feels like a big deal.

388
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:00,880
It may be a small thing to you,

389
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:04,240
but it is huge for me.

390
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:06,480
It is you who is having a fair.

391
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,520
Why should I be humiliated?

392
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,840
Are you all thinking about her now?

393
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,560
After your nagging,

394
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:19,720
from now on,

395
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:21,080
it'll be hard not to.

396
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:25,040
Get out of this room.

397
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:27,720
Never enter this room again.

398
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:29,080
Never lie on this bed again.

399
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:31,720
Get out.

400
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:42,080
I'm not angry with you.

401
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:43,440
I just want to say.

402
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:44,120
Si Meng.

403
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:45,160
I didn't do anything.

404
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:47,640
You can't doubt me like this just because of a photo.

405
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,800
Your distrust of me

406
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:51,880
makes me so disappointed.

407
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:54,680
But I will figure this out for you.

408
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:17,080
Mr. Du.

409
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:21,640
What's wrong?

410
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:22,520
Why so mysterious?

411
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,160
I want to ask you something.

412
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:25,600
Last time, at the company party,

413
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,720
I got unconscious,

414
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,040
who took me to the hotel room?

415
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:31,080
Me.

416
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:33,160
And?

417
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:35,240
And Wei Lan.

418
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,120
Did you leave first?

419
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:38,840
No.

420
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:39,680
We left together.

421
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:40,920
Then?

422
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,000
Then...

423
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,040
Then we each called a taxi,

424
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:45,680
left the hotel and went home.

425
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:47,920
What happened?

426
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:49,880
Nothing.

427
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:51,880
I'm just asking.

428
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,080
Have you lost something?

429
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:54,320
No.

430
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:55,120
It's okay.

431
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:56,200
You can leave.

432
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:58,280
Do you have Wei Lan's number?

433
00:22:58,280 --> 00:22:59,000
Yeah.

434
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:00,760
Give it to me.

435
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,320
I can do it now.

436
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,200
Call me if you need anything.

437
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:56,640
Hello?

438
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,560
How was the interrogation?

439
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:01,600
Of course,.

440
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,640
As expected,

441
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:07,240
the filthy couple is trying to 
make their confessions identical.

442
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,040
I gotta go.

443
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:26,760
Why do you want to do this?

444
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:31,280
I want to shine a new light

445
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:32,800
on your lukewarm life.

446
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:34,880
My life has nothing to do with you.

447
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,880
If you want anything, come to me.

448
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:39,120
If you dare to hurt her,

449
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:40,920
I will hunt you down.

450
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:44,440
I never loved you.

451
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:46,360
Why are you yelling at me?

452
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,520
Do you want to tell more people about this?

453
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:52,960
A persona is a personality

454
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:54,400
and breeding.

455
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:55,980
You have a vulgar personality

456
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:57,360
and poor breeding.

457
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:01,600
Sounds familiar?

458
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:08,640
My wife said that.

459
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:12,880
Why are you doing this to us?

460
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:16,520
Just because I didn't keep you in the office?

461
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:19,400
I see you've been working so hard 
to pretend to be a good husband.

462
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,480
I want to ease your burden.

463
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:24,800
Just because I didn't keep you in the office?

464
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:33,240
You kicked me out of the company.

465
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:36,360
I'll kick you out of your family.

466
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:42,520
Du Shijun.

467
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:45,760
This is called retribution.

468
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:04,840
Did you fake that photo?

469
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:05,920
Of course, not.

470
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:06,880
I'm telling you, Wei Lan.

471
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,800
I will never touch you even if I was unconscious.

472
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:12,200
How can you say "never" when you were unconscious?

473
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:14,960
Your logic is not suitable for accounting.

474
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:16,800
You can be a good stand-up comedian.

475
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:20,760
Say it.

476
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:22,160
How much do you want to end this?

477
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:25,920
Now you are talking like an accountant.

478
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:28,680
Want to accuse me of blackmailing?

479
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,320
What do you want from me?

480
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:37,720
Your IQ is getting lower and lower.

481
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:43,520
I am not interested in you at all.

482
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:45,000
I...

483
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,840
You can slap me.

484
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:52,080
Take care, Mr. Du.

485
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:06,360
Stop there.

486
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:10,640
I stopped.

487
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:12,320
Have you lost your mind?

488
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:15,080
Who do you think

489
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:16,360
knows him better? You or me?

490
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:19,640
At least,

491
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:21,560
I know him better than you after he drinks.

492
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:23,320
Do you have a sense of shame?

493
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:27,640
You asked for it.

494
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:28,720
I'm telling you.

495
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,160
He won't leave me and my children,

496
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:31,800
even if I make him.

497
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:33,760
Because he dares not 
to admit his relationship with you.

498
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:35,680
He is just fooling around with you.

499
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:36,880
Don't mistake it for love.

500
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,120
I just don't understand women like you.

501
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:40,600
The husband cheated,

502
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:42,440
but the wife always clears up the mess.

503
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:44,520
Without an income,

504
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:45,600
you have to rely on his support.

505
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:48,000
So you have to swallow the bitterness.

506
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:51,000
Do you know what you are

507
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,040
in my eyes?

508
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:55,160
You're a mouse that can't see the light.

509
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:57,600
We are not even the same species.

510
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:01,560
Where to?

511
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:03,240
Antarctica.

512
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:05,280
Then you should take a taxi across the road.

513
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:07,160
Go back to your mouse hole.

514
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:31,160
Let's play!

515
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:41,080
Mommy.

516
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:42,280
What's our dinner today?

517
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:44,040
I'm starving.

518
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:45,880
I'll order you some food.

519
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:46,320
OK?

520
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:47,200
Delivery.

521
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:48,080
I want to eat at McDonald's.

522
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:50,760
Mom, I want the toys from McDonald's.

523
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:51,800
You got them.

524
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:00,120
Look, Zhuang.

525
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:01,880
Like this.

526
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:33,440
You can have the bear.

527
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:35,640
It's the bad guy.

528
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:43,040
Zhuang. Yuanyuan.

529
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:44,760
Stop playing.

530
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:46,880
Mommy wants to ask you a question.

531
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:49,680
Zhuang.

532
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:55,880
What is the question?

533
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:57,880
Question!

534
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:00,040
I want to ask you

535
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:03,880
if,

536
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:07,560
I mean if,

537
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,720
your daddy and I are separated,

538
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:14,520
who do you want to live with?

539
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:17,040
Are you getting divorced?

540
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:19,040
Did you hear me?

541
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:22,000
I said if.

542
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:25,160
That's tricky.

543
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:28,240
I know you said if.

544
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:29,880
One of you must have done something wrong.

545
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:30,480
Yeah.

546
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,560
So? What do you say?

547
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:34,880
Who do you pick?

548
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:36,680
I'll live with whoever did nothing wrong.

549
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,040
What about Yuanyuan?

550
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:46,160
I...

551
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:48,760
I pick daddy.

552
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:50,760
Why?

553
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:54,680
Because mommy can rest if I do so.

554
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:02,400
Love you, mommy.

555
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:07,800
You are really a sweetheart.

556
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,320
Go play.

557
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:14,360
Mommy, I give you a puppy.

558
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:27,800
Mom.

559
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:29,560
What?

560
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:31,960
Is dad having an affair?

561
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:34,240
Who said that?

562
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:35,800
My classmate, Ye Bolin said it.

563
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:38,160
How did he know?

564
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:41,000
He said his mother told him so.

565
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:41,960
His dad

566
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:44,360
divorced his mother.

567
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,720
It's funny that his mom

568
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:51,280
told him that.

569
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:53,480
Don't worry about their business.

570
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:56,480
I told you that

571
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:57,840
it was hypothetically.

572
00:31:58,120 --> 00:31:58,600
Mom.

573
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:00,120
If dad cheated on you,

574
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:02,000
I would live with you.

575
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,520
Let's ignore him.

576
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:30,920
Daddy.

577
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:33,120
Dad.

578
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:35,320
Why are you eating this?

579
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:36,800
Where's mommy?

580
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:39,920
Mommy said she wasn't feeling well.

581
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:41,760
She didn't want to eat.

582
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:43,360
Now she is resting in her bedroom.

583
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:06,040
Get out.

584
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:29,040
You are up.

585
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:30,840
Are you hungry?

586
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:35,400
Check your phone.

587
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:00,200
Congratulations, Du Shijun.

588
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:02,120
What a lovely boy.

589
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:03,520
Do you have a name yet?

590
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:04,080
No?

591
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:05,240
I'll pick one for you.

592
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:08,040
If it's a boy, Du She.

593
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:08,960
If it's a girl, Du Shu.

594
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:11,080
You can be a filthy family.

595
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:26,639
Give that to me.

596
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:47,080
Talk.

597
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:00,880
How many times do I have to tell you?

598
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:03,440
It's groundless.

599
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:05,000
We are not what you think.

600
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,640
What do I think?

601
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,960
All you need is to get married to her.

602
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:16,840
I was too drunk that day.

603
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:19,640
I can't remember a thing.

604
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:23,720
When I asked you about the photo last time,

605
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:25,680
you were so sure that

606
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:26,800
you hadn't done it.

607
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:30,360
And today, you don't remember?

608
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:35,800
Don't you know

609
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:38,440
how important this family is to me?

610
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:40,720
You know it.

611
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:47,280
I thought I knew.

612
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:50,320
Cut out the crap.

613
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:51,600
Just say what do we do now.

614
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:01,240
Divorce.

615
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:04,160
There is no discussion about this.

616
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:08,120
I don't want to keep doing this.

617
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:11,080
You've done what you've done.

618
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:13,680
No matter she keeps it or not.

619
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:15,000
Whatever you do in the future

620
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:16,840
will have nothing to do with me.

621
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:19,640
A fetus is a life.

622
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:22,880
I can't get over that.

623
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:25,080
I can't persuade myself, either.

624
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:27,800
I was hammered.

625
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:30,000
How could I?

626
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,440
Who knows if you were really that drunk?

627
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:33,680
Ask Yongjie.

628
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:35,080
He is your subordinate.

629
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:36,720
Of course, he will back you up.

630
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:38,880
Nothing I say can change your mind, can I?

631
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:41,480
Save your words.

632
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:45,080
Tell her to keep that baby.

633
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:48,320
We can run a paternity test after it's born.

634
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:50,520
If it's mine.

635
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:51,560
You can hit me, curse at me,

636
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:52,280
and divorce me.

637
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:53,240
I'll take them all.

638
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:55,040
But if it's not mine,

639
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:57,280
can we keep living our life?

640
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:58,200
No way.

641
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:00,880
That's easy for you to say.

642
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:04,720
You want me to wait another ten months?

643
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:05,440
In the ten months,

644
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:07,240
I will feel sick whenever I think of

645
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:07,920
that child is yours.

646
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:09,360
How can I live a life like that?

647
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:10,800
We have to pretend to be okay

648
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:11,920
in front of the children,

649
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:12,600
right?

650
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,560
I'm telling you, Du Shijun.

651
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,560
Our children are old enough.

652
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:18,520
They'll know.

653
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:20,080
Do you know what

654
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:21,160
Zhuang said to me this afternoon?

655
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:24,200
He asked me if dad's having an affair.

656
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:25,600
I don't know how to answer him.

657
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:27,920
I wanted to say yes.

658
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:30,680
I'm afraid of hurting your image in their mind.

659
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:32,880
If I said no,

660
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:35,000
I would be lying to my children.

661
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:37,880
But I lied.

662
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:39,720
Till now,

663
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:41,280
I still choose to protect you.

664
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:44,600
Du Shijun, why are you doing this to me?

665
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:46,280
I give birth to two children for you.

666
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:48,800
Do you think that's easy?

667
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:04,280
Whoever cheated gets no money in the divorce.

668
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:05,280
That's the rule.

669
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:09,440
I'll get the children, the house, and the car.

670
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:12,000
You will pay the rest of the mortgage.

671
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:14,600
Child support should be paid every month
in accordance with the law.

672
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:17,000
If you agree,

673
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:18,760
I will draft an agreement tomorrow.

674
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:20,440
I disagree!

675
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:22,720
I'm innocent!

676
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:24,240
Why should I agree?

677
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:26,960
It's not up to you, Du Shijun.

678
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:28,240
All these years,

679
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:29,840
I've been a good wife.

680
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:32,640
I understand it's a part of your job

681
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:35,000
to socialize, to drink, even to flirt.

682
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,920
I've always turned a blind eye to it.

683
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:40,600
But now there is a baby.

684
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:44,600
A baby!

685
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:48,240
Now.

686
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:49,480
Pack up and get out.

687
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:52,560
Never enter this home again.

688
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:54,400
I feel sick at the sight of you.

689
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:57,840
Get out.

690
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:00,840
Where can I go?

691
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:02,360
I don't care!

692
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:03,880
Go to her place.

693
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:06,240
You can take care of her.

694
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:07,520
She is a pregnant young lady

695
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:08,560
without a husband.

696
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:09,560
It's no piece of cake.

697
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:10,200
Right?

698
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:11,680
Go.
