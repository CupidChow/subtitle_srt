Do as I say.

110
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:32,600

Then we're all on the same page.

121

What is

124
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,000
inappropriate about that?

125
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,800
If he says so,

126
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,120
then I don't have a problem with it at all.

127

As long as it's reasonable,

00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:29,040
I'll make it happen.

00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,080
I think

146
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,480
you can make that decision.

to work as an employee.

152
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,920
That's beneath her, right?

What do you think, uncle?

00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:01,480
I suggest

155
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:03,840
maybe we can

156
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,800
sell 5%

157
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:08,000
of each of our shares to her

158
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,680
at the original stock price.

159
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:13,720
This way, we'll be partners.

How about this, Gu?

00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,400
Don't ask her to buy shares.

I'm fine with that. What do you say, Peihong?

167
00:07:37,159 --> 00:07:38,600
Then, that's settled.

168
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:41,120
I'll ask the lawyers to draft a contract.

00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,360
All the better.

176
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,080
Dinner together.

177
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:53,800
My treat!

178
00:07:55,159 --> 00:07:56,520
That's settled. See you.

179
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:00,720
That cheapskate rarely pays for dinner.

180
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:01,680
Let him.

181
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:03,920
Thank you.

182
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,160
Grandma.

183
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,480
That's a lot of dumplings.

184
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:09,880
I want to make sure we have enough.

185
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,520
The last time

186
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:14,000
we invited two young men

187
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,600
to have dumplings

188
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,440
was 28 years ago.

189
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,360
Back then,

190
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,640
you were only two years old.

191
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:23,400
Bao Xue's parents hadn't got married

192
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,400
and were here for Lunar New Year for the first time.

193
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,320
Granny, does your memory serve you right?

194
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:28,920
We had dumplings together

195
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,800
to celebrate New Year after that.

196
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:31,320
But then,

197
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,919
they were no young men anymore.

198
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,679
Now I get it.

199
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,080
By the way,

200
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:41,720
do you still remember

201
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:42,559
Shen Peihong,

202
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:43,440
my roommate in Norway?

203
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,560
She's in Beijing now.

204
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:46,760
I know.

205
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,040
Yu Songyang told me.

206
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,320
You're having dinner tomorrow, right?

207
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,040
Yeah.

208
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,240
You don't mind, do you?

209
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:57,160
It's just dinner with old schoolmates.

210
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:58,520
There will be other people, too.

211
00:08:58,520 --> 00:08:59,360
Besides,

212
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,640
I will be watching him.

213
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:01,800
Why would I mind?

214
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:02,960
You'll be there?

215
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:04,440
Of course.

216
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,120
Yu Songyang invited me.

217
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,040
So, why not?

218
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,680
I'd seem petty if I didn't go.

219
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:09,960
Sis, you're so generous.

220
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,600
Of course.

221
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:13,240
Give me some chores.

222
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,440
I am boring.

223
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,040
You?

224
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:15,960
Come on.

225
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:18,040
We'll be grateful if you don't make a mess.

226
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:20,480
Leave.

227
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,840
Go stay with your boyfriend.

228
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:22,880
Have a chat or something.

229
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:25,880
I don't know what to say to him.

230
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,120
I came here because I felt awkward over there.

231
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,160
When you're in love, you don't need to talk.

232
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,000
You can just stare at each other and feel happy.

233
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,440
That'd be so awkward.

234
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,320
What are you mumbling about?

235
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,440
You want chores, right?

236
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,440
Set the table.

237
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:42,640
Okay.

238
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,080
She rarely does that.

239
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,600
The Wurenbacher tastes good.

240
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,440
Want one?

241
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,440
I need to drive.

242
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:54,360
You go ahead.

243
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,640
You're right not to drink if you're driving later.

244
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:58,600
Bao Xue told me

245
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,800
you're going on a business trip tomorrow.

246
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:01,560
Yeah.

247
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:02,800
I was supposed to go in October,

248
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:03,880
but

249
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,520
it got postponed.

250
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:06,840
How long are you going?

251
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:08,520
I won't be back till March.

252
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:09,840
It takes longer to film a costume drama.

253
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,920
Why is that?

254
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:14,480
It's different from modern drama.

255
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,280
Taste this.

256
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:18,360
Without chopsticks?

257
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,040
I forgot.

258
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:19,800
Just grab one.

259
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:23,720
It's hot.

260
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,080
So?

261
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:31,240
Yum.

262
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,040
Amazing.

263
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:34,240
Granny, it tastes perfect.

264
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,800
Am I a lab rat to you?

265
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:41,160
Dad makes the best dinner.

266
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:45,000
The Fish of Fortune is done.

267
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:49,200
Dad, can I try it?

268
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,560
You're getting better at cooking.

269
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,720
Are you hungry?

270
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:54,240
The dumplings are ready.

271
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,000
I'll go get them.

272
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,080
Try the fish dad made.

273
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:00,720
It's hot.

274
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,240
All done.

275
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:04,640
Dig in.

276
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,240
I was very efficient, right?

277
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,520
How did it go this afternoon

278
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:13,520
at the company?

279
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,360
Ma doesn't think I'm writing fast enough.

280
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:17,960
He suggested I write somewhere alone.

281
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:19,400
Alone?

282
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:20,640
Where?

283
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:21,600
Aranya.

284
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:23,800
Aranya?

285
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:26,280
You're going to the seaside in winter?

286
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,840
That's when it's quiet there.

287
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:28,880
How can I write

288
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,280
with so many visitors in summer?

289
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,120
You said yes?

290
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:33,280
Not yet.

291
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:34,960
I had thought

292
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,240
I'd finish the two-month work

293
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:37,920
in a month.

294
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,120
But it didn't go as planned.

295
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:42,000
Back then, no one rushed me to write.

296
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,800
I used to write some every day.

297
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,000
But now,

298
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:47,840
I often stay up all night in front of the laptop

299
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,360
without writing anything.

300
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,440
Yeah.

301
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,360
There are too many distractions at home.

302
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,480
That's why I can't leave.

303
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:57,160
If I leave you in charge,

304
00:11:58,520 --> 00:11:59,560
you'll go crazy.

305
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:01,680
Making money is...

306
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:02,800
It's a shitty business.

307
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:04,880
We're eating!

308
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,000
Language!

309
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,440
Where did you learn that word?

310
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,800
I didn't teach him to say that.

311
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:20,880
Alright.

312
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,040
I'm fine. You can go back.

313
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:23,640
What are you doing?

314
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:25,600
You'll leave tomorrow.

315
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:26,680
I'll help you pack.

316
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:29,320
Let's go.

317
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:50,320
Have a rest.

318
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,800
I'll do it myself.

319
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:52,960
Allow me.

320
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:56,560
Do you think I am too slow?

321
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:58,400
Absolutely not.

322
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,440
I just thought you could use a rest

323
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,720
since you just recovered.

324
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:04,840
I'm fine.

325
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:05,600
I'll do it.

326
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:07,880
It won't take long.

327
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:09,760
Go take a rest.

328
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:12,880
Go.

329
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:27,760
It's late.

330
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:30,040
I'll pack the rest.

331
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:31,320
Let me drive you back.

332
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,720
Do you have a new toothbrush here?

333
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:36,560
I...

334
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,040
I am not going back tonight.

335
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:46,360
Xiaoyu.

336
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:48,120
Come.

337
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:49,880
Sit over here.

338
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,560
I've been doing a lot of thinking.

339
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,120
I have.

340
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,440
I don't want to say this,

341
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:13,280
but I have to.

342
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:16,040
It's for our own good.

343
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,600
What is it?

344
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:23,120
I think we should break up.

345
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,720
Why?

346
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,120
Hear me out.

347
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,280
Recently,

348
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:34,080
I've been observing you.

349
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:36,520
I can feel

350
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:39,320
that you're trying so hard to fall in love with me

351
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:41,160
and be my girlfriend.

352
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,880
But you won't develop feelings for me
 through pretending.

353
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:45,640
You either love me

354
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:47,240
or you don't.

355
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:48,640
I can see it.

356
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:55,160
I admit that I love you.

357
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:57,280
And I don't want to lose you.

358
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:58,840
But if we keep doing this,

359
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:00,240
you'll be miserable.

360
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:03,400
We won't be happy.

361
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,240
Remember you asked me to change the photo?

362
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,160
You were trying to tell me

363
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:14,560
you were jealous, right?

364
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,840
You were afraid that I might think

365
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:18,120
you don't care for me.

366
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,280
But

367
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,240
you started to play with your phone

368
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,320
before I even put the old photo away.

369
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:28,080
That means you were only pretending to be jealous.

370
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,440
You help me with all the packing.

371
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,760
I know you're trying to prove to me

372
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:36,080
that you care for me.

373
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:37,440
But

374
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,840
these are just methods.

375
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:41,080
They are not from your heart.

376
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,360
During dinner tonight,

377
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:49,640
we talked about Bao Xue

378
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:51,600
and Yu Songyang getting married.

379
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:54,520
Did you notice the way they looked at each other?

380
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,200
That was the look of two people

381
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,440
who are truly in love.

382
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:01,640
But I glanced at you,

383
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:04,360
and you were avoiding eye contact with me.

384
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:07,080
You weren't pretending at that moment.

385
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,320
You did that without even knowing it.

386
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:13,600
And that's because you don't love me.

387
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,800
Right?

388
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:20,240
I can pretend I haven't noticed any of these,

389
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,400
and we can keep on living like this.

390
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,520
But I think if I do that,

391
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:28,280
I'd be too selfish.

392
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:30,720
Xiaoyu,

393
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:33,080
everything I've done for you,

394
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:35,120
I did them willingly.

395
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:38,280
I don't expect anything in return.

396
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,200
If we stay together,

397
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,000
I hope it's because

398
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,680
you truly love me

399
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,520
rather than feeling guilty.

400
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,640
I don't want you to be with me so that you can repay me.

401
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:55,160
Do you understand?

402
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:06,640
I am sorry, Liu.

403
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:10,280
I think I owe you too much.

404
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,160
When I finish shooting,

405
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:22,800
buy me a drink.

406
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:31,280
I'll buy you as much drink as you'd like.

407
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:53,800
Xiaoyu,

408
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,200
I love you.

409
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,200
This will be the last time I say it to you.

410
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,720
I won't say it anymore.

411
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:44,280
Go to bed.

412
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:46,960
I fell asleep.

413
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:48,880
Even coffee doesn't work now.

414
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:52,760
I am immune to caffeine now.

415
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,800
I'll finish this paragraph first.

416
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:00,320
Go to Aranya.

417
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:02,120
No.

418
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:03,640
Our family needs me.

419
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:07,880
Do as I say.

420
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:10,720
Just go.

421
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,920
Or you won't be able to finish your book,

422
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,560
and you won't be able to take care of us.

423
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,240
Plus, you might get sick.

424
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:16,960
It's a lose-lose for all.

425
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:22,160
If you go, at least

426
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,720
you can focus on one thing

427
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:25,000
and be more efficient.

428
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:27,400
You can come back when you finish it.

429
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:28,880
I'll take care of the kids.

430
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,840
Then, you can visit me on weekends.

431
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:36,200
We'll go find you

432
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,240
when you're almost done.

433
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:40,840
Let's go to bed.

434
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:41,720
Yeah.

435
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:43,840
I'll save the file.

436
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:50,920
You must be exhausted.

437
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:51,920
You did great.

438
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:05,080
Dai Xiaoyu, you're so slow!

439
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:08,040
Are you ready or not?

440
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:10,760
I know.

441
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:13,480
Thank you for understanding.

442
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:15,640
You said five minutes.

443
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:17,440
How many five minutes has it been?

444
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:18,760
Okay.

445
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,400
I'll visit you before Lunar New Year.

446
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:22,760
Great, bye.

447
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:27,760
Stop rushing me.

448
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,400
I was on the phone with Hua.

449
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:30,200
Hua?

450
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:33,200
She wasn't

451
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,960
angry with me about last time, was she?

452
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:35,960
She wasn't.

453
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:37,320
She's very understanding.

454
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:41,960
So?

455
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:43,600
When are you going to work for her?

456
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:46,520
I told her that Mr. Chai has been good to me.

457
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,360
I'd be ungrateful if I leave now.

458
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,200
I'll stay and help him for a while longer.

459
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:53,360
Hua said that since it's the end of the year,

460
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,960
I can wait after the New Year vacation
 to make a decision.

461
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:00,000
So, Hua likes you a lot.

462
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,280
The Hua I know

463
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,240
is someone

464
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,080
who wouldn't wait

465
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:05,200
more than one day to do the things she wants.

466
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:08,000
Let's go.

467
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:09,640
Where are we going?

468
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:10,600
Afternoon tea?

469
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:12,840
Let's go shopping.

470
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:14,120
Shopping?

471
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:16,080
Can't you just buy things online?

472
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:18,880
Shanshan's birthday is next month.

473
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,440
Let's pick a gift for her.

474
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:21,920
Great.

475
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:24,200
Have you thought about what to buy her?

476
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:25,160
No.

477
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:26,160
No?

478
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,160
She likes watches.

479
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:29,880
Too expensive.

480
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:31,960
I'm here.

481
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,000
I'm in the house.

482
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:33,680
You're here?

483
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:34,720
How's everything?

484
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:35,840
I'll show you.

485
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:40,920
Here's the couch, the TV,

486
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:46,720
and the sea.

487
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:48,480
Nice.

488
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:49,400
Is this where you live?

489
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:51,080
What are you doing?

490
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:52,600
I just finished a meeting.

491
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:54,240
Alright.

492
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,080
I'll unpack and then start to write.

493
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,560
Don't be late to pick up the kids.

494
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:58,680
I won't. Don't worry.

495
00:21:58,880 --> 00:21:59,600
I won't be late.

496
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,200
Bye.

497
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:20,520
I just realized that

498
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,760
this is the first time I've lived in a hotel alone

499
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:24,720
since we got married.

500
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:29,640
[Crossroad Bistro]

501
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:30,720
Try this.

502
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:31,960
This is our specialty.

503
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:32,720
Okay.

504
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:34,840
Come on.

505
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:36,320
Let's fill our glasses.

506
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:37,360
I'll propose a toast.

507
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:40,440
First,

508
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:42,040
I want to toast Shen Peihong,

509
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:44,120
our goddess

510
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:46,120
who's traveled thousands of miles

511
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:47,800
and came back to her homeland with glory.

512
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:51,720
Such weird word choices.

513
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:52,400
I was being poetic.

514
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:53,280
Thank you.

515
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:54,080
Welcome back.

516
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,360
You've started drinking already.

517
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:57,680
This is Feng Xi,

518
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:58,840
our partner.

519
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:00,000
Hello.

520
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,560
Feng Xi, have dinner with us.

521
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:03,720
I'm good.

522
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:05,080
There are many customers out there.

523
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:06,360
Enjoy yourselves.

524
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:09,720
Come join us when you're less busy.

525
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:10,440
Okay.

526
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:15,320
Why is every partner of yours

527
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:16,760
a beautiful lady?

528
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:18,840
Don't get any ideas.

529
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,320
She's taken.

530
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,480
Come on.

531
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:23,960
I was just giving praise.

532
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,280
What are you talking about?

533
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:27,000
Give me a break. I know you too well.

534
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:29,400
The second toast

535
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:32,040
is to Ms. Dai Xiaoyu.

536
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:33,440
Me?

537
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:35,920
We three were schoolmates
 at the architecture college.

538
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:38,360
You were Peihong's roommate.

539
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:39,840
I've heard

540
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,400
so much about you.

541
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:43,320
Now that I've finally met you, I'd be honored

542
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:47,000
to add you on WeChat.

543
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,240
Come on. Cheers.

544
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:48,800
Cheers.

545
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:49,440
Cheers.

546
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:52,600
What's wrong with you today?

547
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:53,960
You're so talkative today.

548
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:55,600
What?

549
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:57,960
Our company is joined with such a talented person.

550
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,480
I am in a good mood!

551
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:01,120
Give me a break.

552
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,200
Fill your glass.

553
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,520
Let's have a drink.

554
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:05,560
Okay, allow me to fill your glass.

555
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:06,720
Pace yourself.

556
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:07,520
Yu,

557
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:09,440
all jokes aside,

558
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:12,760
you helped me convince Peihong to work with us,

559
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:14,040
and you gave 10%

560
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:16,360
of your shares to her.

561
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:18,800
Seriously, you're such a good friend.

562
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:23,120
Sincerely, I raise my glass to you.

563
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,080
We are a team in the future.

564
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,480
Save the formalities.

565
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:27,320
Peihong,

566
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:29,520
shouldn't you drink to him as well?

567
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:31,480
Of course.

568
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:34,040
Cheers.

569
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:42,040
Help yourselves.

570
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:43,560
Gu.

571
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:45,840
Drink less. Eat more.

572
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,560
I'm fine. I am just too happy.

573
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:48,800
Bao Xue.

574
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:51,000
This one is to you.

575
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:53,080
For what?

576
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:55,400
For having a good eye.

577
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,320
Yu Songyang

578
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:58,480
is the perfect choice for a husband.

579
00:24:59,040 --> 00:24:59,800
He's loyal and generous

580
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:01,960
to friends.

581
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:03,200
He's reliable at work.

582
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:03,960
And he

583
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:05,840
loves you truly.

584
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:06,760
Come on.

585
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:07,760
I'll drink to you.

586
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:09,680
He is generous indeed.

587
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:16,840
I just remembered

588
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:18,000
I talked to a producer this afternoon

589
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,280
and we're supposed to meet tonight.

590
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:20,440
I totally forgot about it.

591
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:22,160
Silly me.

592
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:24,640
Sorry, guys.

593
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:26,160
I gotta go.

594
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:27,800
Peihong,

595
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:28,560
sorry I can't

596
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:29,680
stay for dinner.

597
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:30,200
This is to you.

598
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:31,360
It's fine.

599
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:32,160
I'll...

600
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,240
Bye.

601
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:36,360
Why didn't you tell me?

602
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:38,800
I'll see her out.

603
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,160
It's alright. I'll walk myself out.

604
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:41,680
You're seriously leaving?

605
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:44,000
It's alright. Don't mind us.

606
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:45,240
I'll give her a ride.

607
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:53,840
Did I say something wrong?

608
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:05,240
Bao Xue.

609
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:07,360
You've been drinking. You shouldn't drive.

610
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:08,680
I won't.

611
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:09,520
I'll get a taxi.

612
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:13,720
It's late.

613
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:15,280
Maybe you can have a rain check?

614
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:16,400
The taxi is here.

615
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:17,840
Sis, go inside.

616
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:18,920
It's cold out here.

617
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:19,760
Bye.

618
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:20,920
Take care.

619
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:23,680
Call me when you are there.

620
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:26,800
Let's go back.

621
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:31,800
Do you really believe she's meeting the producer?

622
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:34,400
What else?

623
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,080
Can't you tell she's mad?

624
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,040
Why?

625
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:40,560
You got Shen Peihong a job

626
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:41,840
and gave your shares to her.

627
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:42,560
Yet you didn't

628
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:44,000
consult Bao Xue about such a huge decision.

629
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:45,920
It's nothing.

630
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:47,080
I was just helping out

631
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:48,120
an old friend.

632
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:50,040
Is she seriously mad about that?

633
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:52,440
Is it really nothing to you

634
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:54,200
from a male's perspective?

635
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,200
Shen Peihong and I broke up years ago.

636
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:57,040
Besides, we

637
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:59,080
will never get back together.

638
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:00,240
Don't tell me that.

639
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,520
Explain it to her when you go home.

640
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,600
What's happening?

641
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,000
I can't believe it.

642
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:17,000
I thought Bao Xue knew all about it.

643
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:20,560
I wouldn't have said anything if I had known better.

644
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,320
It's not your fault.

645
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,600
When you guys were together,

646
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:25,960
did he do anything like this?

647
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:29,080
If he had done things like this,

648
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:30,280
I would've taught him not to do it ever again.

649
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:37,200
Peihong, I am so sorry.

650
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:38,800
Bao Xue is young. She can be unreasonable.

651
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:41,600
I think you're the unreasonable one.

652
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:42,960
Well said.

653
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:45,280
Why are you blaming me?

654
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:46,760
Who else should we blame?

655
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:48,560
Didn't I tell you yesterday

656
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:50,680
to consult Bao Xue at home?

657
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,040
What if she disagreed?

658
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:53,560
If you consulted her ahead of time,

659
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:54,920
she would agree to it for sure.

660
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:55,920
But you didn't tell her anything,

661
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:57,960
which changed the nature of the whole thing.

662
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:00,280
I blame you for being a blabbermouth.

663
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:05,600
Aren't you gonna defend me?

664
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,880
Why am I being criticized?

665
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:09,640
Never mind.

666
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:11,600
I'll just try to cheer her up.

667
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:12,800
Come on.

668
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,240
What?

669
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:07,720
Don't be mad.

670
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:09,040
I made a mistake, okay?

671
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:11,240
What did you do wrong exactly?

672
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:12,320
I...

673
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:16,200
I shouldn't have given my shares to her

674
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:17,240
without asking for your permission.

675
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:20,920
Didn't we reach a consensus that

676
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:22,640
I won't interfere with your business,

677
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:24,560
your shares, and your money?

678
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:26,200
You have the right to give her
 as many shares as you want.

679
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:28,560
You don't have to pretend to be sorry.

680
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:34,080
Then let's talk.

681
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:34,880
About what?

682
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,600
You don't even know why I am mad.

683
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:37,840
What's there to talk about?

684
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:38,720
Tell me, then.

685
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:39,560
I won't be able to guess it

686
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:40,600
in a million years.

687
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,120
How about this?

688
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,320
Tell me this one time.

689
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,520
I promise I won't make the same mistake ever again.

690
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:47,560
Okay?

691
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:52,880
Yu Songyang.

692
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,400
If you wanna talk,

693
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:57,720
then, I'll have a nice talk with you.

694
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:01,080
How old are you, huh?

695
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:02,520
Why do you have such a low EQ?

696
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:05,160
What does it have to do with EQ?

697
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:06,480
I've told you

698
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,040
we didn't break up 'cause we fought a lot.

699
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:09,320
There was no bad blood.

700
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:12,040
It was one of those

701
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:14,000
most peaceful breakups between us, okay?

702
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:15,240
So, I think of her

703
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:16,840
as an old friend.

704
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:17,480
Now she's...

705
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:18,120
A friend?

706
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:20,280
Can you be friends with your ex?

707
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:20,920
Can't I?

708
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:22,240
Can you?

709
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:25,720
Can't I?

710
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:27,080
Never mind.

711
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:33,240
What do you want me to do?

712
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:36,400
I'll forgive you

713
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,840
for not telling me

714
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:39,080
you were meeting with her.

715
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:40,880
Now you helped her find a job.

716
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,120
You even gave her your shares.

717
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:42,960
This is huge.

718
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:44,480
Why did you hide it from me?

719
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:45,800
You said you won't interfere with my work.

720
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:47,120
It's not the same.

721
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:48,840
We're talking about respect.

722
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:51,560
I won't interfere with your decisions.

723
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:53,240
But I am your girlfriend.

724
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:54,560
I have the right to know.

725
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:56,480
I was afraid you'll say no.

726
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:57,960
Were you afraid I'll say no,

727
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:59,800
or that you'll lose face in front of her

728
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:01,000
if I say no?

729
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,200
I'd promised her back then.

730
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:03,000
Fine.

731
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:05,240
So, correct me if I am wrong,

732
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:07,720
but you think it's more important to look good

733
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:08,840
in front of your ex

734
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:10,800
than care about my feelings.

735
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:11,920
You're distorting the argument.

736
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:13,000
Why are you yelling at me?

737
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:14,480
Are you embarrassed that I am right?

738
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:15,760
If you behave like this,

739
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:19,440
then I can't continue this talk.

740
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:20,120
I've told you that

741
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:21,040
nothing's going on between...

742
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:22,080
I know.

743
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:24,160
You two broke up years ago.

744
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:25,840
And I know your feelings for me are real.

745
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:26,520
Then, why are we even...

746
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:27,480
However,

747
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:30,040
you can't help her behind my back.

748
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:33,000
If you think I am petty,

749
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,200
then so be it.

750
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:36,200
You can be nice to her

751
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:37,760
and help her all you want

752
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:39,160
with me knowing about it.

753
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:40,360
You can give all your shares

754
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:41,640
or the whole company to her,

755
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:43,160
let alone 10% of the shares.

756
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:44,120
I don't care.

757
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:45,520
But I must tell you this.

758
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:46,480
I feel uncomfortable

759
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:48,040
with the fact that you and your ex

760
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:50,920
are working together.

761
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:55,120
Why are you so mad at me

762
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:56,240
and arguing with me

763
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:56,680
over her?

764
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:57,600
It's not about her.

765
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:59,000
It's about you.

766
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:00,760
Don't distort the argument.

767
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:07,080
Fine.

768
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:08,880
Bao Xue, tell me.

769
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:10,080
What should I do

770
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:11,120
to make you comfortable?

771
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:12,560
Can we just move on from this?

772
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:14,000
I don't want you to do anything.

773
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:15,800
We've made a deal long ago.

774
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:17,520
We'll never force each other

775
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:20,000
to do anything against their will.

776
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:20,760
Right?

777
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:22,400
I believe that nothing will happen

778
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:23,200
between you and her.

779
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:25,520
And I won't break up with you

780
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:26,920
because of this.

781
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:28,280
So, just let time

782
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:30,080
do the magic.

783
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:31,240
Therefore,

784
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:33,240
please give me some time.

785
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:34,480
Don't push me.

786
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:35,320
Okay?

787
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:36,880
I...

788
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:45,240
Come on.

789
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:53,000
Zhuang, are you dressed?

790
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:54,760
Hurry.

791
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:56,400
Open the door.

792
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:57,840
Let's go.

793
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:02,720
Hurry.

794
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:29,360
Hello.

795
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:31,280
Welcome to Bestore, where you can get

796
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:32,920
over one hundred kinds of high-quality snacks.

797
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:35,600
Pretty girl, what would you like?

798
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:37,000
We're here to buy

799
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:40,240
my mom's favorite pork jerky.

800
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:42,560
Great. What else does your mom like?

801
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:44,160
Scallops,

802
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:45,480
pistachios,

803
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:47,760
almonds, and preserved mango.

804
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:49,840
These are your favorite snacks.

805
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:52,120
Don't scare your sister.

806
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:53,040
We all like those.

807
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:54,400
We'll have two packs of everything.

808
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:56,160
Here. We look forward to seeing you again.

809
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:56,720
Thanks.

810
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:58,600
Let's go. Let's go see mom!

811
00:33:58,600 --> 00:33:59,880
Let's go!

812
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:02,640
Honey.

813
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:05,160
Lunch is ready.

814
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,200
Sweetie.

815
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:08,400
What?

816
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:09,360
Look!

817
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:15,760
What does it mean?

818
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:16,920
Stop it.

819
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:20,880
I am gonna be a father?

820
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:22,159
I am gonna be a father?

821
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:22,719
Yeah!

822
00:34:25,159 --> 00:34:26,600
I am gonna be a father!

823
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:30,400
Careful, don't hurt our baby.

824
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:31,960
Let's eat.

825
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:34,960
Eat plenty.

826
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:37,040
Look how happy you are.

827
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:38,880
I am gonna be a father.

828
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:42,520
This will be a family of three.

829
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:44,000
I'll be cooking for three, too.

830
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,320
Of course.

831
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:46,440
Honey.

832
00:34:47,719 --> 00:34:49,080
When our son grows up,

833
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:50,400
I'll teach him how to cook.

834
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:52,719
Are you silly?

835
00:34:53,239 --> 00:34:54,600
So that he can cook for us.

836
00:34:59,040 --> 00:34:59,840
Hold on.

837
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,320
Hello, delivery from JD.COM.

838
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:07,720
Thanks.

839
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:09,320
No problem.

840
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:21,160
Wait a sec.

841
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:28,880
Come here.

842
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:31,120
I bought you a down jacket.

843
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:33,440
Wear the new one.

844
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:35,400
I'll wash this one.

845
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:41,240
You just bought it?

846
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:43,320
Yeah, from Global.JD.COM.

847
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:46,840
Try it on and see if it fits.

848
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:01,680
It fits perfectly.

849
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,360
Looks good.

850
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:16,480
I'm going to work.

851
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:18,680
Go.

852
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:49,920
What is it?

853
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:50,800
The contract.

854
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:52,320
For Peihong.

855
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:54,080
Why don't you just give it to her?

856
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:55,240
Her mom was discharged this morning.

857
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:56,160
She'll be late.

858
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:57,880
I need to go out in a minute.

859
00:36:58,040 --> 00:36:59,200
Fine. Leave it here.

860
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:05,960
Was Bao Xue furious last night?

861
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:08,640
How was she

862
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:09,760
when you were leaving the house?

863
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:12,840
Last night,

864
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:15,440
she was angrier than the angry birds.

865
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:17,360
I thought I'd better not argue with her

866
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:18,520
since she was furious

867
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:20,400
and wait till she calms down.

868
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:23,520
But in the morning, it was like nothing had happened.

869
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:25,320
She was awfully nice.

870
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:25,840
See?

871
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:26,760
She even bought me a jacket.

872
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:28,760
It was all very unsettling.

873
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:32,520
Tell me, do you

874
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:33,960
enjoy suffering?

875
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:36,440
Now she can't be nice to you?

876
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:41,000
I think

877
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:42,480
she just came to her senses

878
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:44,280
and chose to believe you.

879
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,240
Come to think of it,

880
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:48,160
Bao Xue is young but considerate.

881
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:51,080
If it were my wife,

882
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:53,080
she'd make a scene.

883
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:54,520
Do you even have a wife?

884
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:55,800
My ex-wife.

885
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:56,680
Alright?

886
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:59,680
Stop discriminating against divorced people.

887
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:01,600
My office is stinky because of your cigarette smell.

888
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:03,800
Look at yourself.

889
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:06,720
Peihong.

890
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:07,560
You're here early.

891
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:09,600
I came as soon as I dropped my mom home.

892
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:10,240
Great.

893
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:11,520
Have a seat.

894
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:13,560
You come over here.

895
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:24,600
Here are two contracts.

896
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:28,200
One is the partnership contract.

897
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:29,640
It's for you.

898
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:31,640
The other is for the transfer of shares

899
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:32,800
from Yu Songyang.

900
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:33,800
Take it.

901
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:36,200
You two

902
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:37,000
shall read

903
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,760
every word of it thoroughly.

904
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:40,360
If everything in there is correct,

905
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:41,240
you can sign the contract.

906
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:50,040
I want to tell you something.

907
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:53,360
I told you I'm gonna stay in China.

908
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:56,160
I made the decision 'cause my mom was sick,

909
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:57,040
and I was worried.

910
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:59,400
Now that she's discharged

911
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:01,000
and looks fine,

912
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:02,600
I've decided

913
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:03,680
to go back to Norway.

914
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:06,560
Peihong,

915
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:07,760
please don't feel pressured.

916
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:09,040
I've talked to Bao Xue.

917
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:09,920
She won't...

918
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:11,200
That's not it.

919
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:14,840
It's just that I've been doing a lot of thinking.

920
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:17,640
I've been abroad for so many years

921
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:19,720
and I've got a stable job.

922
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:20,880
I'm used to life back there.

923
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:22,600
I'm afraid I won't adjust well

924
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:24,120
if I come back to China.

925
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:24,960
So,

926
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:26,080
it's not for any other reasons.

927
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:29,360
I am here to say goodbye.

928
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:30,680
For what it's worth,

929
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:32,360
I'm deeply moved that

930
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:34,480
you two are willing to help me.

931
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:36,760
Peihong, is it...

932
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:37,600
Stop it.

933
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:39,400
You know me well, don't you?

934
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:40,680
I've made up my mind.

935
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:41,640
I've booked my flight.

936
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:46,680
Okay.

937
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:48,200
Peihong,

938
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:50,760
I respect your decision.

939
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:53,320
When are you leaving?

940
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:54,480
We'll see you off.

941
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:55,840
It's alright.

942
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:57,560
You are busy.

943
00:39:57,560 --> 00:39:58,720
My parents will see me off.

944
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:02,840
Please give this

945
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:03,640
to Bao Xue.

946
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:10,280
This is for Bao Xue.

947
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:13,960
Okay.

948
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:15,600
Guys,

949
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:16,880
see you.

950
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:24,800
Thanks.

951
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:26,600
Take care of yourself.

952
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,040
Bye-bye.

953
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:44,680
Take care.
