I have no choice but to see you.

93
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:55,480

94
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,400

00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:00,920

97
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:01,920
That's impossible.

But I didn't do anything.

99
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:08,080
Are you so sure that you did nothing?

100
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,360
Didn't you just say

101
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,640
that you were too drunk to know what happened?

102
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,320
Maybe that woman took the initiative.

103
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,720
It's not about who took the initiative.

104
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:18,800
I know myself well.

105
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:21,040
If I'm drunk,

106
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:22,960
I…

107
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:23,640
I just…

108
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:24,880
can't.

109
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,240
The problem is not

110
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,320
whether I did it or not.

111
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,360
The problem is that she doesn't believe a word I say.

112
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:32,200
Of course.

113
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,680
If you want her to trust you,

114
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,240
you have to prove it.

115
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,920
Otherwise, there's nothing I can do.

116
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:41,240
But I can't find that woman at all.

117
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,400
Did you try?

118
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:44,560
Of course.

119
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,320
She deleted me on WeChat.

120
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,120
Then I got her number

121
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,240
and called her.

122
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:49,880
I told her

123
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:52,200
that nothing happened between us.

124
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,520
And I suggested that we should meet.

125
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:54,640
So we met at a cafe.

126
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,080
She made it clear

127
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,640
that because I didn't make her an employee,

128
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,280
she wanted me to be kicked out of my family.

129
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,200
Then I asked her how much money she wanted

130
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,680
so that she would stop.

131
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:04,880
She didn't say a word

132
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:05,520
and just left.

133
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:06,880
I felt so helpless then.

134
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,240
I just sat there paralyzed until she left.

135
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,760
Then I tried to call her but she turned off the phone.

136
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:12,160
Are you an idiot?

137
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,120
You even thought of giving her money?

138
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,280
I didn't.

139
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,320
If you have this intention,

140
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,120
she'll have something on you

141
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,040
and you'll be really doomed.

142
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,760
Then everything she said will become real.

143
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:21,840
I have no idea what to do.

144
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:22,720
It's just…

145
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,840
Have you heard of anything as ridiculous as this?

146
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,440
Let me get this straight.

147
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,080
If you had cheated on Si Meng…

148
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:36,760
No, I didn't.

149
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:37,760
I'm telling the truth.

150
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,200
Do you believe me?

151
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,520
It makes no difference whether I believe you or not.

152
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:44,520
The problem is that Si Meng won't believe you.

153
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,000
OK, go on with your assumption.

154
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,760
Assume that you had cheated on her.

155
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:51,480
All right?

156
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,320
And that woman is pregnant with your baby.

157
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,840
If she didn't want anything

158
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:58,160
and just disappeared,

159
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:00,240
but suddenly showed up now,

160
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,080
there are only two possibilities.

161
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:03,880
A,

162
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:05,480
she wants your money.

163
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:07,320
Or B, she wants you.

164
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,160
Right?

165
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:09,520
Right.

166
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:10,800
If she wants your money,

167
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,960
she'll send the evidence

168
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:15,000
to your company.

169
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:15,800
If so,

170
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:16,680
in order to cover it,

171
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:17,920
you have to give her money.

172
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:19,440
If she wants you,

173
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,120
she'll send the evidence to Si Meng.

174
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:22,720
Once Si Meng sees it,

175
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:23,920
she'll definitely divorce you.

176
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,280
Then you and that woman are real.

177
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:26,800
But there's nothing between us.

178
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,480
That's the problem.

179
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:30,360
If you're telling the truth,

180
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:32,160
what does she really want

181
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:32,880
by doing this?

182
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:33,600
Exactly. For what?

183
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,680
I'm asking you.

184
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:36,680
But…

185
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,200
According to her,

186
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,320
she just wanted to get back at me.

187
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,680
So she's even willing to get pregnant

188
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:42,120
just to get back at you?

189
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,400
Do you actually believe it?

190
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,080
Then what?

191
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,160
You're lying.

192
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:55,160
I swear to God.

193
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:56,080
If I'm lying,

194
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,680
I'll be hit by a car when I go out.

195
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,160
What's more,

196
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,000
I am a person

197
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,280
who has self-respect.

198
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:03,120
If I had really done that,

199
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,120
I wouldn't have come to you shamelessly.

200
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,480
I'd just disappear on my own.

201
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,360
But I have a happy family.

202
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,720
I wouldn't let her destroy it

203
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:13,400
just because she's seeking revenge.

204
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:27,720
Listen to me.

205
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,760
In my view, it is imperative

206
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:32,680
that you find Wei Lan.

207
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,640
Once you have found her,

208
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:36,640
we'll know whether she's really pregnant.

209
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:38,440
If yes,

210
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,240
even if that baby is not yours,

211
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:40,240
it has to be someone else's.

212
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:41,920
As long as we find her,

213
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:44,160
we can find the father of that baby.

214
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:46,160
Then the truth will be clear

215
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,520
when everyone is there.

216
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:48,960
But, of course,

217
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:52,360
if the child turns out to be yours,

218
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:53,640
you have to admit it.

219
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:58,000
What if she's not pregnant?

220
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,040
In that case,

221
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,320
at least you can prove that she was framing you.

222
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,800
That's exactly what she's done.

223
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:03,920
I regret it so much

224
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:06,080
that I didn't record our talk that day.

225
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:07,480
But the problem is,

226
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:09,640
how can I prove that I did nothing that night?

227
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,200
I don't think you can prove anything.

228
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:15,760
There was no camera

229
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,360
in the hotel room.

230
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,000
Right?

231
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:25,040
Then why are we wasting time here?

232
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,880
But anyway,

233
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:31,000
even if you can't prove you didn't do it,

234
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,360
at least you have a chance to prove

235
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:33,160
that she lied.

236
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:33,960
Correct?

237
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:35,920
As long as you can prove that she lied,

238
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,080
you'll gain the upper hand.

239
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,040
By then,

240
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,560
I'll talk to Si Meng for you.

241
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:42,760
Maybe

242
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:44,200
your marriage can still be saved.

243
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:52,000
Maybe there's no other way.

244
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:53,400
But…

245
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:54,680
I just can't find her.

246
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:55,480
Even if I keep calling her,

247
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:56,160
she…

248
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,520
she just won't take it.

249
00:13:58,720 --> 00:13:59,120
Fine.

250
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,320
I'll help you find her.

251
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,600
I have my way.

252
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,440
Du Shijun,

253
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:07,920
I'll be honest upfront.

254
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:11,240
I'm helping you, but I'm actually helping Si Meng.

255
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,200
If you lie to me,

256
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:15,680
I'll help Si Meng to destroy you.

257
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,400
Your life will be miserable.

258
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:22,840
Thanks, Ms. You.

259
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,840
Don't call me Ms. You.

260
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,640
We are not business partners.

261
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,440
Then I'll call you Shanshan.

262
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:36,320
Shanshan,

263
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:37,480
can I

264
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:39,120
ask you another favor?

265
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:40,520
Sure.

266
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:44,520
She's still really mad at me

267
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,000
at the moment.

268
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:47,720
I don't think I can go home.

269
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:49,280
I'll stay at the hotel.

270
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:50,520
I wonder

271
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:53,520
if you could spend some time with her.

272
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:54,880
I'm afraid that if she's on her own…

273
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:56,720
Now is not the time.

274
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:57,920
If I visit her now,

275
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:59,440
she'll know that you asked me to.

276
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,800
It'll be counter-productive.

277
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:04,280
I see.

278
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:07,760
Don't worry.

279
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,560
I know her too well.

280
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,440
She must be on the verge of breaking down.

281
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:13,400
She'll call me soon.

282
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:14,720
Then thanks in advance.

283
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:17,280
I never

284
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:19,040
hurt anyone.

285
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,400
But if anyone

286
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:21,600
hurts me and my friends,

287
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:22,720
I'll make him pay for it.

288
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:33,040
She indeed blocked you on WeChat.

289
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,880
I told you.

290
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:36,720
You just wouldn't believe me.

291
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,280
It's already 30 seconds.

292
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:41,680
But seriously,

293
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:43,840
she was so worried about you.

294
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,840
Couldn't you just say something to comfort her?

295
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:48,640
I know my sister too well.

296
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,680
Even though she seems carefree,

297
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:51,880
she's really stubborn.

298
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:53,560
You need to say what she wants to hear.

299
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:54,640
After she calms down,

300
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:55,840
everything will be OK.

301
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:57,000
And you can continue to do whatever you want.

302
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:59,160
But you just had to trigger her.

303
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:00,640
Now everyone is hurt.

304
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:02,560
Zhiyuan fell off the cliff right in front of me.

305
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:05,000
The last few days, as soon as I closed my eyes,

306
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,600
I saw him falling off the cliff

307
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,120
and the look on his face.

308
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:19,320
Then he got farther and farther away.

309
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:21,680
I could also hear

310
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:24,720
the last word he cried out when he fell,

311
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,040
Songyang.

312
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:31,880
She forced me to give her an answer in that situation.

313
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:33,520
What did she expect me to say?

314
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:37,880
Personally,

315
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:39,920
I totally get it.

316
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,360
Zhiyuan's death

317
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:48,880
might be a pity for others.

318
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:51,520
But the pain will stay

319
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:52,920
with his family forever.

320
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55,800
A man

321
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,960
should keep his word.

322
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:01,600
But I'm Baoxue's sister.

323
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:03,360
I have to be selfish on this.

324
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:05,839
Baoxue is also your family.

325
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:07,960
I know her too well.

326
00:17:08,359 --> 00:17:09,760
If anything happened to you,

327
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:10,800
trust me,

328
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,160
she would stay single for the rest of her life.

329
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,280
That's why I should be honest with her.

330
00:17:15,079 --> 00:17:16,040
I can't promise her anything

331
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:17,119
that I can't do.

332
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:18,440
Sometimes,

333
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:19,960
a white lie

334
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:21,960
can ease up the relationship between two people.

335
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:25,480
You're in no position to say that.

336
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,560
Don't you feel embarrassed for yourself?

337
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:31,040
Whether Baoxue accepts your apology or not,

338
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:32,360
as long as you still love her,

339
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:34,240
you should comfort her.

340
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:34,640
Correct.

341
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,080
Just admit your fault.

342
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:37,680
Don't explain anything.

343
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:38,920
Just let her express her feelings.

344
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:40,520
According to my experience,

345
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:41,040
you won't break up.

346
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:44,160
You surely have a lot of experience.

347
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:44,880
Come on.

348
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,120
Tell me.

349
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:47,360
Where did you get your experience?

350
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:48,320
Don't turn it on me.

351
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:49,400
I'm just offering my opinion.

352
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,120
The point is

353
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,160
that they won't break up.

354
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,880
Anyway, she was so determined to leave me that day.

355
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:54,680
She didn't even turn around.

356
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:55,520
She won't take my call.

357
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:56,960
And she blocked me on WeChat.

358
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:58,920
She won't even give me a chance to explain.

359
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:01,600
Did you actually hear what I said?

360
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:02,920
It's not about explanation.

361
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:04,040
You need to apologize.

362
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:05,800
But I don't know what I did wrong.

363
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:07,200
What should I apologize for?

364
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,080
Do you mean, like,

365
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,920
"Sorry, I told you the truth?"

366
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,000
I don't think

367
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,800
you understood a word I said.

368
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,040
If you apologize for your mistake,

369
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,280
it's just natural.

370
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:21,640
If you apologize for nothing,

371
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:22,560
it's called generosity.

372
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:23,920
In other words,

373
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:24,880
the point is not

374
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:25,480
whether you apologize or not.

375
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:26,320
The point is

376
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:27,840
whether you are willing

377
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,360
to forget your ego

378
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,840
in front of the woman you love.

379
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,120
You need to love her

380
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,040
and protect her.

381
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:35,040
This is more important

382
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:36,840
than anything, right?

383
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,440
Look at him.

384
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:44,280
A person as evil as him

385
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:46,120
knows how to beg for forgiveness.

386
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:47,000
Why can't you?

387
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:48,960
It's too hard.

388
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:50,520
Sleeping is easy.

389
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:51,480
Why don't you just go to sleep?

390
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:52,560
But you can't sleep, right?

391
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:54,000
Do you think there's anything easy?

392
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:55,720
It's not that hard, Songyang.

393
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:57,120
It must be easier

394
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:58,240
than hanging on to that

395
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,200
for so long.

396
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,360
I think this is much easier.

397
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,560
It just occurred to me

398
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:08,400
that the last time the three of us had a drink

399
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,720
was when we were in Norway.

400
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,120
Time flies.

401
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,120
Xiaoyu,

402
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:19,560
you rent an apartment?

403
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:20,480
Yes.

404
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:22,160
How can she rent…

405
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,120
What are you two hiding?

406
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:29,080
Nothing.

407
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:30,600
Granny,

408
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:31,600
I'm saying

409
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:32,720
that someone like her

410
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:35,240
can't even look after herself.

411
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:38,600
Don't slack on your meals.

412
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,160
You should learn how to cook.

413
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,760
Don't always order in.

414
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:43,240
OK.

415
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:44,560
Just eat your dumplings.

416
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:46,240
You're not eating?

417
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:47,640
How can these

418
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:49,760
be enough for you two?

419
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:51,320
I'll get more.

420
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:56,240
Don't mention Peng Pai.

421
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,120
When are you telling Grandma?

422
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:00,760
She'll know it sooner or later.

423
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:02,040
Just leave things as they are.

424
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:03,720
If you tell her now,

425
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:04,920
she'll ask a bunch of questions,

426
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:05,920
some serious questions.

427
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:07,800
You are in a relationship. That's all.

428
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:08,840
What are you afraid of?

429
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:09,720
Then what about you?

430
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:12,320
What about the relationship between you

431
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:13,480
and Yu Songyang?

432
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:14,760
Maybe I should tell Grandma

433
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:15,920
so that she can teach you a lesson.

434
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,240
Who's in a relationship with him?

435
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:18,840
At least it's not me.

436
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:20,200
Let him live in his dreams.

437
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,720
I assume you use all the skills

438
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,160
you learned in the acting classes on me.

439
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:24,640
Listen.

440
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,200
If I was the director,

441
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,680
you wouldn't get away with this one.

442
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:28,800
It's so superficial.

443
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,360
Don't try to convince me.

444
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:32,360
I won't forgive him.

445
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,000
So many days passed.

446
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,520
He didn't even come to see me.

447
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,880
Maybe he really thinks that time heals everything.

448
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:38,400
Right.

449
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:39,800
As time goes by,

450
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:41,800
I'll just forget this person completely.

451
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:42,760
That's for sure.

452
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,480
You even blocked him.

453
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,320
So?

454
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,320
If he can't even find a way to contact me,

455
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:49,920
he should not be in any relationship at all.

456
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:52,040
What are you murmuring?

457
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:53,160
I was saying

458
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:54,600
the dumplings are so good.

459
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:56,520
Have you had any?

460
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:58,720
Of course.

461
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:01,280
I don't even need to taste it.

462
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,200
It must be great.

463
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,400
I just know it when I see them.

464
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:11,840
Grandma,

465
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:14,120
it's not Spring Festival or anything.

466
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:15,240
Why did you make dumplings?

467
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:18,240
I  made them for the trip.

468
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:20,720
Where are you going?

469
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,120
I'm going to Aranya for a few days

470
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,840
with Dr. Lv and others.

471
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:27,880
Aranya?

472
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:31,880
You even know such a popular destination.

473
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:33,200
Do you know

474
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,560
that this is a place where you'll lose…

475
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:39,400
You'll lose your mind when you see the scenery.

476
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,000
When I went there with Yu…

477
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:44,280
See?

478
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:46,320
You just can't forget.

479
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:46,840
Shut up.

480
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:47,680
What are you talking about?

481
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:49,360
Nothing.

482
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:51,000
Aranya?

483
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:52,080
Where is that?

484
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:53,200
I've never been there.

485
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:56,320
Granny,

486
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:57,680
I remember

487
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:58,800
that you and Dr. Lv

488
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:00,720
went on a trip not long ago.

489
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,280
And you just ate hours ago.

490
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,000
Who says

491
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:06,320
that we can only go out once?

492
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,200
Grandma.

493
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,520
Is this trip

494
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,360
a romantic one?

495
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:14,400
I told you.

496
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:17,920
You can only know a person

497
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:20,000
when you travel with him.

498
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:22,240
So a romantic trip it is.

499
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:24,080
Don't worry about me.

500
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:25,960
As long as you take care of yourselves,

501
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:27,160
I'll be relieved.

502
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:29,760
Everyone has worked hard lately.

503
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,160
Just go home when you finished.

504
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:36,760
Excuse me.

505
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:38,640
Are you still open?

506
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:42,320
Sorry.

507
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:43,680
We're closed.

508
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:46,320
Could you just cook some simple courses for us?

509
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,040
We specially came here.

510
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:49,880
I'm so sorry.

511
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:50,920
What about

512
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:52,040
you come here tomorrow?

513
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:53,720
Let me explain.

514
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,880
My boyfriend just came back from abroad.

515
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:57,480
I wanted to bring him here for dinner.

516
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:59,920
I even booked a table tonight.

517
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:01,480
But his flight

518
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:02,880
was three hours late.

519
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:04,480
She mentioned your restaurant a lot.

520
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:05,920
She really likes it here.

521
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:06,720
But…

522
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:08,520
He's leaving tomorrow.

523
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,840
Can you do me a favor?

524
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:12,440
We won't stay long.

525
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:14,080
We'll just order your specialties.

526
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:15,000
Let them take a seat.

527
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:21,880
Take a seat, please.

528
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:22,640
Thank you.

529
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,720
One of you is abroad

530
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:31,160
and the other is at home.

531
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,280
You are far away from each other.

532
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:33,480
But you are still so close.

533
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,680
No matter how busy he is,

534
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,840
he comes to see me each month.

535
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:39,120
But he won't need to anymore.

536
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,120
Why?

537
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:43,880
Because we're getting married.

538
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:47,240
After we are married,

539
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:48,720
I'll go to Canada with him.

540
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:50,320
So this is the last time

541
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:51,640
he came back to Beijing alone.

542
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,240
I wish you all the best.

543
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:56,560
Thank you.

544
00:23:58,640 --> 00:23:59,200
Have some water.

545
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:00,000
Thanks.

546
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:11,960
Why are you staring at me?

547
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:14,440
What, I'm not allowed to?

548
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,800
It seems that something's bothering you.

549
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:19,560
Before I came here, yes.

550
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,320
Then, will you

551
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:22,160
talk to me about it?

552
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:30,720
Recently,

553
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:31,640
whether it's my company,

554
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:32,480
or the restaurant,

555
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,200
or my friends,

556
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:38,200
nothing is going well.

557
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:40,800
I did want to talk to you before I got here.

558
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:42,840
But then I thought,

559
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:45,400
what's the point of telling you about it?

560
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,720
You would definitely tell me

561
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,520
that it's not important.

562
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:49,560
You know,

563
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:51,360
now I can see the truth behind most things

564
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:52,680
because you always tell me

565
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:54,000
that it's not important.

566
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:56,240
Thanks to you,

567
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,440
I've got many things done.

568
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:58,840
You always tell me

569
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:00,680
to allow for any possibility.

570
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:01,960
Today,

571
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:03,720
I have so many friends

572
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:05,280
also because

573
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:07,280
you told me

574
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:09,240
to help my friends as much as I can.

575
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:11,080
Why does it sound like

576
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:12,640
I'm your mentor?

577
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:14,880
Don't flatter yourself.

578
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,200
You're not a mentor for sure.

579
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:18,440
Do you know what a mentor does?

580
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:20,120
A mentor

581
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:22,400
not only points out the student's problems,

582
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,040
but also helps him solve them

583
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:25,160
so that he can improve himself.

584
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:26,040
And what is this?

585
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:29,200
It's called preaching the truth,
imparting knowledge, and resolving doubts.

586
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:30,440
You

587
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:34,160
don't impart knowledge or resolve doubts.

588
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:35,640
You only preach the truth.

589
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:38,080
You know,

590
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:39,480
sometimes when I see

591
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:41,400
a missionary on TV,

592
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:43,320
I just want to take off his robe

593
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:45,080
and put it on you.

594
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:50,240
I often think about

595
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:53,560
what on earth

596
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:54,760
do I come to you for?

597
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:56,600
What are you to me?

598
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:58,760
A lover?

599
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:02,400
But there are no lovers like us.

600
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:04,160
A friend?

601
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,520
But I feel that what's between us

602
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:11,080
is much more than friends.

603
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:13,520
Then I realized

604
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:16,200
that your place is like a temple to me

605
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:18,440
and you're the monk in it.

606
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:21,320
Every day, you do the same things.

607
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:22,840
Striking the bell and reciting scriptures.

608
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:24,240
Reciting scriptures and striking the bell.

609
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:25,720
I come here

610
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:27,200
to purify my soul.

611
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:29,400
I come here from the hustle and bustle of life.

612
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:31,600
Then I hear you striking the bell
and reciting the scriptures.

613
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:32,960
You don't need to say anything.

614
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,320
I just sit here

615
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:35,760
reflecting on everything by myself.

616
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:38,480
And I'll find peace.

617
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:41,560
Everything suddenly seems

618
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,920
so clear to me

619
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:45,560
and I can finally let it go.

620
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:47,440
Then

621
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,280
I go back to the secular life

622
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:51,200
to deal with challenges that come my way.

623
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:57,960
A friend of mine

624
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:00,040
has poor taste in men.

625
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:03,640
She wanted to marry an unreliable man.

626
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:04,880
So many times,

627
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:06,480
I just wanted to yell at her.

628
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:07,640
But once I was about to,

629
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:09,040
I thought of what you told me.

630
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:10,360
"Allow for any possibility."

631
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:13,600
And another friend of mine

632
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:14,080
is having a crisis

633
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:15,600
in her family.

634
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:17,400
She suspects that her husband cheated on her.

635
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:18,560
She came to me for help.

636
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:22,120
But what do I have to do with that?

637
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:24,240
Then I remembered that you told me

638
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:26,560
to help as much as I can.

639
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:29,480
See?

640
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:32,720
You've had a huge influence on me.

641
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:35,360
But in my opinion, every choice you made

642
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:37,960
is out of the kindness of your heart.

643
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:40,200
It has nothing to do

644
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:41,920
with anyone's influence.

645
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:45,600
I truly believe

646
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:49,280
that you have influenced me a lot.

647
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:51,200
How about you marry me?

648
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,760
Don't make fun of me.

649
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,240
No, I'm not.

650
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:59,800
I'm scamming you.

651
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:01,920
A worshiper wants to marry a monk.

652
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:04,440
But the monk has done nothing.

653
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:05,400
That's right.

654
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:06,520
All right. I'll leave you alone.

655
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:07,880
I'm exhausted.

656
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:10,160
I'll go to sleep.

657
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:13,800
Why don't you go home?

658
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:14,720
I need to finish the work.

659
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,360
You can't sleep with the noise.

660
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:17,800
Oftentimes,

661
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:20,200
I would drink a lot

662
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:22,240
and stay at a karaoke club until the early hours.

663
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:23,600
When I get home,

664
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:24,880
I still have to take half a tablet of melatonin.

665
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:26,880
I'm just curious

666
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:27,600
why is it that as long as I'm here,

667
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,480
I can fall asleep fast.

668
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:31,960
How about

669
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:33,000
you sleep in the bedroom?

670
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:34,880
No, I'll sleep right here,

671
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:36,760
right on this couch.

672
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:39,000
It's best for meditation.

673
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,040
Shanshan.

674
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:28,200
Shanshan.

675
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:30,240
I don't want to wake you,

676
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,040
but you have a call.

677
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:33,360
Who is it?

678
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:34,280
Feng Xi.

679
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:36,400
Thanks.

680
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,360
What's up?

681
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:48,560
Which hospital?

682
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:51,200
I'll be there right away.

683
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,000
What happened?

684
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,960
A guest was injured at our restaurant.

685
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,120
I have to go to the hospital.

686
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:58,200
Your driver went home.

687
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:59,040
I'll drive you there.

688
00:29:59,040 --> 00:29:59,720
No, thanks.

689
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:00,480
I don't want to waste your time.

690
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:00,840
Allow me.

691
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:01,840
The guest must be so angry now.

692
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:04,160
What if it's someone who is difficult to deal with?

693
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:05,680
I'll take my key.

694
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:12,760
Here. Careful.

695
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:14,200
Thanks.

696
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:15,720
Thank you.

697
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:16,920
It's our fault.

698
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:17,480
Don't worry.

699
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:18,920
We will take responsibility for this.

700
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:19,480
That's right.

701
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:21,280
Thank god it's not a fracture.

702
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:22,240
I'm all right.

703
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:23,520
You can go home.

704
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:25,080
You're lucky enough.

705
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:27,800
May I

706
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:29,080
speak to you outside?

707
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:29,480
Me?

708
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:30,200
Yes.

709
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:30,880
OK.

710
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:32,800
I'll be back.

711
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:39,480
Thanks. But you don't need to.

712
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:40,800
We weren't careful enough.

713
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:42,200
I never meant to scam you.

714
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:44,440
You have to take it.

715
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:45,520
No matter what the cause is,

716
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:46,480
it happened at our restaurant.

717
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:47,640
So we must take responsibility.

718
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:49,320
I already paid for the treatment.

719
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,200
You can use this for her recovery.

720
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,080
If anything comes up later on,

721
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:53,320
feel free to contact me anytime.

722
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:53,960
OK.

723
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:55,560
May I add you on WeChat?

724
00:30:58,560 --> 00:30:59,040
Here.

725
00:30:59,040 --> 00:30:59,920
Scan my code.

726
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:05,960
Just for your attitude on this matter,

727
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:07,160
we will not bother you anymore.

728
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:09,680
I'm so sorry.

729
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:11,280
But I must remind you.

730
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:12,280
The slope in your restaurant

731
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:13,600
is indeed a threat

732
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:14,840
to the customers' safety.

733
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:16,080
One can easily slip on it.

734
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:18,800
At first, we had steps there.

735
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:19,440
Then the fire department did a review

736
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:20,360
and told us to change the steps into a slope.

737
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:21,840
I had no choice.

738
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:23,720
But after what happened today,

739
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:24,360
I guarantee

740
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:26,080
that we will find a solution.

741
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:26,920
All right.

742
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:28,120
Thanks a lot.

743
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:29,000
That's all right.

744
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:45,920
It's getting loose

745
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:46,880
after so many people stepped on it.

746
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:47,440
It's my fault.

747
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:49,240
I was only thinking about getting back to business.

748
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:50,600
I should have fixed it to the floor.

749
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:53,280
No.

750
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:56,480
It's not about whether it's fixed or not.

751
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,240
The slope is just not safe enough.

752
00:31:58,240 --> 00:31:59,800
People slip on it easily.

753
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:01,560
The other day, a bit of soup dropped on it.

754
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:03,000
I just slipped and fell.

755
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,520
So steps do not
meet the fire department's requirement,

756
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:05,840
while a slope is dangerous.

757
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:08,360
Are you kidding me, God?

758
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:17,960
I've made up my mind. Remove it.

759
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:18,600
Remove it?

760
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:19,560
Yes.

761
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:20,880
What if they come to check again?

762
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:24,120
We'll widen the back door

763
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:25,520
to make it into a fire escape.

764
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:27,400
Then the fire fighting equipment can come in.

765
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:29,800
What's the most important thing?

766
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:30,720
Our guests' safety, of course.

767
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:32,840
Just remove it.

768
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:33,560
I agree.

769
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:40,280
All of you

770
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,360
listen to me.

771
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:44,400
As long as there's one guest here,

772
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:46,320
keep the lights on.

773
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:48,120
Don't save on the electric bill.

774
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:49,520
Today we're just lucky that the guests are nice.

775
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:50,880
If we had run into someone difficult,

776
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,720
they would have brought us down.

777
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:55,760
Any problem?

778
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:57,720
Jesus.

779
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:58,720
Nothing

780
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:03,400
went smoothly for me today.

781
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:04,720
What happened?

782
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:06,680
What did Mr. Du meet you for?

783
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:10,000
Nothing.

784
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,160
I don't want to talk about it.

785
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:13,960
Just go home.

786
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:36,240
I'm so tired.

787
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:39,880
You're like the big sister

788
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:42,200
among your friends.

789
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:45,600
Of course you feel tired.

790
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:51,400
I realized that only when I'm with you

791
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:55,000
can I feel like a woman.

792
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:00,520
Do you think so?

793
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:04,360
As long as

794
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:07,640
you are happy.

795
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:18,880
I'm up.

796
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:20,280
What's the matter?

797
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:25,159
You found her?

798
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:27,639
Thank you so much.

799
00:34:27,639 --> 00:34:29,920
You did me a favor indeed.

800
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:30,840
Don't worry.

801
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:32,719
I will keep it a secret.

802
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:34,520
I'll take you to dinner sometime.

803
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:35,920
Thanks!

804
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,280
Everybody,

805
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:46,239
come to the restaurant at 12:00 PM.

806
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:47,520
We'll have a meeting.

807
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:53,679
Baoxue,

808
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:55,280
I'm afraid your sister is still sleeping.

809
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:56,719
You must wake her up.

810
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:05,440
Du Shijun,

811
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:07,280
I found Wei Lan.

812
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:08,080
Wait for my update.

813
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:09,120
Don't make any move.

814
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:22,560
Si Meng sent me a message.

815
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:24,080
I'll go to meet her.

816
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:25,160
If no further questions,

817
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:26,440
we'll carry out the plan.

818
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:27,160
Mm.

819
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:28,960
Later, I'll send her a photo

820
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,200
and the addresses of her company

821
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:31,640
and her home to the chat group.

822
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:34,400
We won't violate the law,

823
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:35,760
will we?

824
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:37,840
You only need to follow her.

825
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:39,040
You don't need to hit her or yell at her.

826
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:40,040
Why is it not legal?

827
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:41,960
No problem.

828
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:48,720
How are you?

829
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:51,440
Has Yu Songyang contacted you yet?

830
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:53,880
I won't talk to him even if he contacts me.

831
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,000
Don't mention him.

832
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,320
I'm annoyed even by hearing his name.

833
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:00,280
For your information,

834
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:01,840
I'm available before 11:00 AM

835
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:03,440
and after 2:00 PM.

836
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:05,040
But I have to get back before six in the afternoon.

837
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:05,720
OK.

838
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:07,320
I have a dinner to go to with Mr. Chai.

839
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:08,480
I can follow her until five o'clock.

840
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:10,240
And I'm available tomorrow the entire day.

841
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:11,000
Good.

842
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:11,840
I'll be in charge of the night.

843
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:13,000
I don't want to go home anyway.

844
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:17,960
All right.

845
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:18,800
Here.

846
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:20,000
With this tea,

847
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:21,560
I'd like to thank you all.

848
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:22,680
Don't mention it.

849
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:24,480
We'll do our best to help Si Meng.

850
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:30,000
Thank you all in advance.

851
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:30,920
Don't worry.

852
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:31,960
Nothing can go wrong.

853
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:33,040
Trust us.

854
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:33,880
Remember, you're the first.

855
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,000
Watch her near her company.

856
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:35,840
Mm.

857
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,480
Let me emphasize something.

858
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:42,960
No matter when

859
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:44,840
and where, keep a close eye on her.

860
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:45,440
Also,

861
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:46,640
if you find any clue,

862
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:47,600
take a picture of it.

863
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:49,120
If she's out having dinner with someone,

864
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:50,440
you need to know what she orders,

865
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:51,280
what they talk about,

866
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:52,600
and what they drink.

867
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:53,560
Don't slack off.

868
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:55,640
We'll see if we can find any clue.

869
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:57,480
Let's take a picture.

870
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:02,000
Watch her closely.

871
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,000
When she gets home,

872
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:03,960
don't leave yet.

873
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:05,240
Wait and see if someone

874
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:06,360
goes to her place during the night.

875
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:07,880
Then, another one of you
does the same thing the next day.

876
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:09,320
My instinct tells me

877
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:11,480
that within three days,

878
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:13,160
we'll get something.

879
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:14,560
Remember,
it mustn't be the same person two days in a roll

880
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:16,200
and you have to wear different clothes each time.

881
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:17,960
Avoid direct eye contact with her.

882
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:19,000
You must do everything

883
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,800
as they do in crime movies.

884
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:22,920
You can lose her. But don't get her attention.

885
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:25,120
Tell me immediately if you get anything.

886
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:25,800
Copy.

887
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:27,280
Let's do this.

888
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:37,440
You come to see me every day.

889
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:39,360
What about your work?

890
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:41,240
Don't worry.

891
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:42,960
I'm your friend and that's what friends do.

892
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:46,840
Thanks.

893
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:54,520
Over the last few days,

894
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:56,840
I browsed job postings every day.

895
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:59,000
But it only frustrated me more.

896
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:02,720
At my age,

897
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:04,800
I don't have any experience

898
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,040
and I have two kids.

899
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:07,080
I don't have the energy

900
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:08,320
for entry-level positions.

901
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:10,000
No one will hire me for intermediate-level positions.

902
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:12,400
Let alone management-level.

903
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:14,240
The pitiful amount I earn by writing children's books

904
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:15,840
won't even cover our daily costs.

905
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:17,480
I literally gave him everything.

906
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:20,640
How could he do this to me?

907
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:25,200
Before we know the truth,

908
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:26,680
could you stop making yourself more miserable?

909
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:31,920
I believe I am a well-informed person.

910
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:34,080
I've dealt with all sorts of people.

911
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:35,080
The other day, when your husband

912
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:36,400
came to talk about it with me,

913
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:37,920
I actually carefully observed

914
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:39,240
his overall state and the look on his face.

915
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:41,600
I don't think he was lying.

916
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:45,720
I just can't stand any moral defect.

917
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:48,200
I know he loves this family.

918
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:49,640
He also

919
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:50,960
cares about me.

920
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:51,880
But

921
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:55,680
everyone makes mistakes.

922
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:57,200
Who knows if he lost his mind

923
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:58,520
and did something stupid?

924
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:02,680
I asked him to leave the other day.

925
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:04,280
As soon as he left,

926
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:06,400
I was thinking about

927
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:08,560
whether I should make the decision

928
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:09,640
after the baby is born

929
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:10,840
and they do a paternity test.

930
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:13,960
But my answer is no.

931
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:17,280
I can't accept the fact

932
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:19,040
that apart from Zhuang and Yuanyuan,

933
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:20,920
there might be another child

934
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:22,760
whose father is Du Shijun.

935
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:25,440
Not even the possibility of it.

936
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:28,400
I totally get it.

937
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,320
I didn't come to talk you
into getting back together with him.

938
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:31,440
At last,

939
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:32,400
if the test shows

940
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:34,240
that the baby is your husband's,

941
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:34,840
then no more talking.

942
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:35,640
Just get a divorce.

943
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:36,920
What are you scared of?

944
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:38,360
I can help you raise your children.

945
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:46,840
I need to take this call.

946
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:55,720
Hello?

947
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:57,920
Hello.

948
00:39:58,360 --> 00:39:59,120
Where are you?

949
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:00,320
Are you with Si Meng?

950
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:01,200
Yes.

951
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:03,000
Have you got anything?

952
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,840
It's not just anything.

953
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:07,640
It's a life-saver.

954
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:09,680
Don't beat around the bush.

955
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:10,520
Where are you?

956
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:12,360
I'm at the convenience store

957
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:14,440
on the ground floor

958
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:17,840
of Wei Lan's company.

959
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:19,280
Can you just stop it?

960
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:21,000
What did you discover?

961
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,000
Be quick.

962
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:24,880
I found that she's purchasing tampons.

963
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:27,040
How about that?

964
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:28,600
I made a big contribution, didn't I?

965
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:31,280
Are you sure

966
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:33,320
that she's buying for herself?

967
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:35,000
Are you serious?

968
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:35,440
But

969
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:37,400
how can I be sure about this?

970
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:40,000
Is there any way I can prove it?

971
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,960
Why would I know?

972
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:44,000
It's time to use your talent.
