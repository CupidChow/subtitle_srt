00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:07,480
Mom.

5
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,160
Mom, mom.

6
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,000
Why are you here?

7
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,480
I have a meeting in Beijing.

8
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:17,640
Come on.

9
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:18,320
Let's go back home.

10
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:19,120
Let me do it. Don't take this.

11
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,079
Allow me.

12
00:02:20,079 --> 00:02:21,200
Alright.

13
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:23,680
I have to listen to you on everything.

14
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,640
Why didn't you call me?

15
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,840
It was all of a sudden.

16
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,200
But it doesn't take long to make a call.

17
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,480
It's not even one minute.

18
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,680
I see, you just don't want to say hi to me.

19
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:34,440
If that's the case, why am I here?

20
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,920
Never mind. Let's go home first.

21
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:37,880
What do you want to eat?

22
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:40,040
A stir-fried dish will do.

23
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,079
Ms. You,

24
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,920
you have such a nice place.

25
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,160
It can be used for both work and leisure.

26
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:48,040
That's a perfect balance

27
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:49,040
and a double advantage.

28
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:51,040
Good.

29
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:54,920
Feng Xi,

30
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:57,680
are you posting chicken soup for the soul again 
 on WeChat moments?

31
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,320
I have to express my feelings.

32
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:01,520
Only by sitting here can I understand

33
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,360
the meaning of a peaceful and steady life.

34
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,600
What is a peaceful and steady life?

35
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,440
It's just being rich with fewer people around.

36
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:07,360
Classic.

37
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,120
That's what I will post.

38
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:10,440
Right, Shan.

39
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,000
I still don't have your WeChat contact.

40
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:12,880
Come on. Scan the QR code.

41
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:16,680
If you become a shareholder,

42
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,720
I'll let you scan me from head to toe.

43
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:20,560
Alright, alright.

44
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,960
Come on, sit down.

45
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:22,880
Just invest.

46
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,280
I feel so pressed.

47
00:03:26,079 --> 00:03:27,400
For real, let me think about it.

48
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,240
I mean it.

49
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,880
The phrase doing business

50
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:30,560
has never appeared

51
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,600
in the dictionary of my life.

52
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:34,720
You have to allow me some time to consider it.

53
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:35,520
Right?

54
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,640
It's the same as investing in real estate 
 or the stock market.

55
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:38,920
When you are making preparations,

56
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,640
good chances slip away.

57
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:45,680
Do it.

58
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,000
I will lend you the money.

59
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,760
I won't even charge interest.

60
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:54,600
Girl,

61
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,800
are you dumb or what?

62
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,760
It's such a great chance. Why are you still not taking it?

63
00:03:58,640 --> 00:03:59,400
It's not like that.

64
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:02,280
I just felt it's too good to be true.

65
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,720
That's why I hesitate.

66
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:04,800
To me,

67
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:07,000
it feels like

68
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,280
a pie in the sky.

69
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:10,800
Why? Don't you believe it exists?

70
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:11,560
I do believe it.

71
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,760
But I do not believe that the pie

72
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:15,240
will belong to a dumb girl like me.

73
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:17,480
I don't believe it.

74
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,760
It's my first time

75
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:21,399
seeing someone run away from something good 
 without hesitation.

76
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,520
Maybe I'm a bit pessimistic.

77
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,080
I always wonder

78
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:26,800
what have I done to deserve

79
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,600
you involving me in such a nice chance?

80
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,480
You even offer money when I don't have it.

81
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,280
It's not likely to happen.

82
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:33,840
Alright.

83
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,400
I'll answer your questions now.

84
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:38,840
Please.

85
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:44,920
First of all,

86
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,640
I liked you a lot when I first met you.

87
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:50,040
This counts as a reason, right?

88
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:52,480
Second,

89
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:54,320
I understand that in the show business,

90
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,920
as long as you're not a superstar,

91
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,400
you can't earn much money.

92
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:58,960
Then think of my recruitment

93
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,880
as a cushion to fall back on.

94
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:03,520
After all, you can't turn down an extra income.

95
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,200
Also,

96
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,360
when I mentioned this yesterday,

97
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:10,280
I noticed the change in your expression.

98
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:12,680
Deep down, you were not refusing it.

99
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,630
Maybe the only problem is you don't have money.

100
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,200
Then I'm willing to offer help.

101
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:21,920
I don't want to see my friends

102
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:24,560
unable to do something because they don't have 
 enough money.

103
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,160
In addition,

104
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,440
I'm not giving you money to spend.

105
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,440
We will earn money together.

106
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,240
If you don't have enough money for a house or a car,

107
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,760
I probably wouldn't lend it to you.

108
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:36,480
It's different to spend the borrowed money 
 or to make a profit from it.

109
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,360
Right?

110
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:38,720
And one last thing,

111
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,200
which is also the most important one

112
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:44,440
is that I believe you will become famous.

113
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,440
I'm gambling on your future.

114
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,680
I mean it. If you become famous

115
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,680
and you are the shareholder of my restaurant,

116
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:54,280
you will be my spokesperson free of charge.

117
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:09,240
Make up your mind now.

118
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:09,920
Are you in or not?

119
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:10,960
I'm in.

120
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,440
I suddenly remember

121
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:17,760
someone I know is almost perfect for

122
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:19,720
opening the restaurant with us.

123
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:20,720
But I'm not sure

124
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:23,000
if you're happy about having another person on board.

125
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:25,480
Who is it?

126
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:27,800
I only have two conditions.

127
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,040
Firstly,

128
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,960
you have to know this person well.

129
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:31,800
Secondly,

130
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:33,040
she has to be a woman.

131
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,840
She seriously fits these.

132
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:42,760
A seafood and mango salad

133
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,240
and a vegetable and root soup, please.

134
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,720
I will have JamÃ³n Joselito

135
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,159
and paella.

136
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,120
We'll order the house wine.

137
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:54,960
Thanks.

138
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,920
Are you a Virgo?

139
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:17,960
Are you?

140
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,080
I'm not.

141
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,480
I'm an Aquarian.

142
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,480
I'm an Aquarian, too.

143
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:24,960
My rising sign is Vergo.

144
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:27,640
Are you also an Aquarian?

145
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,800
You don't look like one.

146
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:31,480
I was born on the first day of Aquarian.

147
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,760
So I resemble a Capricorn more.

148
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:34,720
I was born on the first day of Aquarian, too.

149
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,440
The 20th of January.

150
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,520
What's your zodiac animal?

151
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:39,680
Dragon.

152
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:40,480
What about you?

153
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:41,760
The same.

154
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,440
Are you 12 years older than me?

155
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:46,200
Are you a 17-year-old born in 2001?

156
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,440
I was born in 1989.

157
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,680
I'm almost 30.

158
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:53,080
We were born on the same day of the same month 
 in the same year.

159
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,800
What a coincidence!

160
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,280
Really?

161
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,200
Yeah.

162
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,440
Are you lying to me?

163
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:06,560
See for yourself.

164
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,160
What's the problem?

165
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:15,880
Nothing.

166
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,920
I can't stand such a stupid ID photo.

167
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,760
But all ID photos are like this.

168
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,840
Show me yours.

169
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,560
You wish.

170
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:30,600
Then how do I know you're not lying to me?

171
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,799
Believe it or not.

172
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,000
I believe you.

173
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:42,200
I do.

174
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:46,560
Later this year,

175
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:49,040
let's celebrate our birthdays together.

176
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:52,280
I never celebrate my birthday.

177
00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:55,120
I always think celebrating aging one more year

178
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,360
is really sad.

179
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:58,440
Don't think about it like that.

180
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,680
Sometimes we celebrate birthdays for happiness.

181
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:01,960
A bunch of people drink together,

182
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,040
get rid of the bad feelings

183
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,000
and welcome the happy future.

184
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:09,160
If you put it like that, it makes sense.

185
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,960
You've been analyzing me for so long,

186
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,200
I actually really want to know more about you.

187
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,560
Tell me something about yourself.

188
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:17,200
Me?

189
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,240
What do you want to know?

190
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,240
Tell me

191
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:21,480
what did you do to be like this?

192
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,720
Well, career-wise,

193
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:26,640
it's just

194
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:29,480
an act of revenge I've been plotting for a long time.

195
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:33,560
Why don't I have such pursuit?

196
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,080
Because you're not poor.

197
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:37,400
Who says I'm not poor?

198
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:39,670
Do you think just because I'm not starving or homeless,

199
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:40,440
it means I'm not poor?

200
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:42,800
I can't afford many things that I like.

201
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:43,720
But it's alright.

202
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,200
I'm particularly good at soothing myself

203
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,640
and telling myself that the grape is sour.

204
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:47,720
I just tell myself,

205
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,280
I can't afford it, so what?

206
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:51,720
No matter how rich I become, Bill Gates will 
 always be richer.

207
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,000
That's the problem.

208
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:55,160
You are not rich,

209
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:56,600
but you're not desperate, either.

210
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,160
because you have a way out.

211
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:01,280
I have a way out.

212
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,880
My way out is calling me.

213
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:05,600
It's my mom.

214
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:10,200
Hey mommy, where are you?

215
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,840
I'm at your grandma's.

216
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:13,120
Look.

217
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:15,520
Hello.

218
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:16,400
Grandma.

219
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,160
Mom, are you in Beijing?

220
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:19,320
I'm here for a meeting.

221
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:20,960
Then wait for me at grandma's place.

222
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:21,960
I'll get back home now.

223
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:22,880
OK.

224
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,240
Don't rush.

225
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:25,760
Safe journey.

226
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:26,400
Alright.

227
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:27,040
Kisses for you.

228
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:27,600
Bye-bye.

229
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,360
I need to go to my mom.

230
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,400
She doesn't come here often.

231
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:31,760
Off your go, find your way out.

232
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:32,600
Alright.

233
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,600
What about the business?

234
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,120
That's a deal.

235
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:35,760
Come on.

236
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:36,840
Bye-bye.

237
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:37,560
Bye-bye.

238
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:38,600
Bye-bye.

239
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:41,920
Bao Xue.

240
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,000
I think she is

241
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:45,960
great fun.

242
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:48,040
She is good at the way of speaking,

243
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:50,480
but deep inside, she is a kid who never grows up.

244
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,680
Then introduce yourself to me.

245
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:01,520
Me?

246
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:08,880
What do you mean?

247
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,480
I'm just checking you on behalf of my sister

248
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,760
in case our efforts are wasted.

249
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:23,920
Do you think I want a relationship with her?

250
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:27,200
When I'm with her,

251
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,920
I always forget that she's a woman.

252
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:31,760
She and I are

253
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:33,560
just like brothers.

254
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:40,520
I thought I'm on a mission.

255
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,200
It turns out I think too much.

256
00:11:44,890 --> 00:11:45,640
It's not like that.

257
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:46,680
Don't get me wrong.

258
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:49,880
She's been like a boy

259
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,160
ever since she was a kid,

260
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:55,560
jumping around like a monkey.

261
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,680
But when it gets serious,

262
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:58,610
she is frightened.

263
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,080
Every time she did something wrong,

264
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,840
I solved the problem for her.

265
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:03,840
I believe what you said.

266
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:10,760
Last time, I hurt you by mistake.

267
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:12,160
It will be my treat.

268
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:13,620
I disagree.

269
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:14,760
No guy asks a girl to pay the bill

270
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:16,120
when the two of them go out for a meal.

271
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:19,240
You're a gentleman, aren't you?

272
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,360
Of course.

273
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:23,280
In my world,

274
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:24,760
I will only let the girl pay the bill

275
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,000
under one circumstance.

276
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:26,960
Which is?

277
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:30,120
Which is when she is my future wife

278
00:12:31,530 --> 00:12:33,040
because she is in charge of my money.

279
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:37,840
That's a good habit.

280
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:38,800
Alright.

281
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,040
You can pay the bill this time.

282
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,000
I will pay the next time.

283
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,320
Don't you ever worry about paying!

284
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:44,960
Waiter.

285
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:45,880
Bill, please.

286
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:51,480
It's been ten years since dad passed away.

287
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,680
When a man dies, it's like a light goes out.

288
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:57,680
His breath turns into wind and flesh into ash.

289
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:02,040
After your dad's funeral,

290
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,480
all my strength was gone.

291
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:07,360
I even felt my bones couldn't support me.

292
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,640
After you left,

293
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:14,120
I lay on the bed

294
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,040
for two whole days.

295
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:20,000
Then you bought a train ticket

296
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,320
and disappeared for two years.

297
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,560
We didn't hear anything from you.

298
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,320
Your brother fell out with me

299
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:29,480
for your dad's savings

300
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,200
and his house.

301
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,760
I just wanted to get out

302
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,280
and hide in a quiet and peaceful place.

303
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:39,000
Is it Jiuzhaigou in the picture on the wall?

304
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:41,240
Yeah.

305
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:44,320
I remember I sent you

306
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,520
a postcard from there.

307
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:48,840
It's hot.

308
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:51,760
After I got the postcard,

309
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,040
I called you immediately.

310
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,480
But your phone was turned off.

311
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:55,480
Why couldn't you just

312
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:57,160
give me a call and let me

313
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:58,280
know that you were safe?

314
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:00,600
You know perfectly well that we were all thinking 
 about you.

315
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,000
Why do you have such a cold heart?

316
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:03,600
My dear old lady.

317
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:09,960
My whole life has been tangled with your dad.

318
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:12,920
I don't want you to bother me.

319
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:15,520
I just want to live a life

320
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:18,280
I want to live.

321
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:21,760
Your words are really hurtful to me.

322
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:23,680
We care about you

323
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,480
but you say we bother you.

324
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:29,040
I know that you are filial.

325
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:32,800
You're different from your brother.

326
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:38,120
You and my brother will eventually reconcile.

327
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,080
Blood is thicker than water.

328
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:42,440
My brother

329
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,360
makes you unhappy.

330
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,360
He's indeed a bit narrow-minded.

331
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,560
But he's your son, after all.

332
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:50,120
He doesn't mean anything bad.

333
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:51,840
Nothing bad?

334
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,320
Then what is bad for you?

335
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,120
Is it murder and arson?

336
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:57,480
Is it not bad if he wants my house?

337
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:01,120
He wants to provide for you when you're old.

338
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,280
Him? Providing for me?

339
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:05,160
If he does, I'd been dead a long time ago.

340
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:08,120
Alright. Let's not talk about this.

341
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:10,160
You're being stubborn again.

342
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:11,760
Anyways, since my brother was a kid,

343
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,460
everyone says he has your temper.

344
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:15,560
He is straightforward and doesn't know how to be gentle.

345
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:16,560
He has my temper?

346
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:17,960
He is not like me.

347
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,320
He is like my enemy.

348
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,560
I'm not as selfish as him.

349
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:24,320
It's only your opinion that he's selfish.

350
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:28,360
Are you here only to try and persuade me?

351
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,360
Are you trying to be a peacemaker between me and him?

352
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:32,600
It's not like that.

353
00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:34,000
I won't make you angry anymore.

354
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:35,560
I won't, alright?

355
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:38,720
I won't mention a thing about you and your son.

356
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:39,320
Alright?

357
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:41,560
Calm down.

358
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:42,200
Calm down.

359
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,560
My dear old lady.

360
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:44,320
Don't be upset.

361
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:55,400
I was wondering why Xue is so handful.

362
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:57,480
It turns out she is like you.

363
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,960
She's almost 26 years old.

364
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:02,080
She's always in different crews.

365
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,440
She doesn't do proper jobs

366
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,480
and doesn't have a stable relationship.

367
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:09,560
Don't be a back-seat driver.

368
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:11,000
You should mind your own business.

369
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:12,440
Let her take care of herself.

370
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,720
You should go back and live happily

371
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:17,440
with Qidong.

372
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:19,200
That's better than everything.

373
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,240
We are living happily.

374
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:24,680
Your husband

375
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:27,440
is 100 percent nice

376
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,840
to his wife and child.

377
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:31,280
When you were still in a relationship,

378
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:33,520
he was never an eyesore to me.

379
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:35,640
He has a good career

380
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:36,840
and also takes care of the family.

381
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,520
He is reliable in general.

382
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:41,880
Your dad is not like that,

383
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:45,200
he lay on the sofa every time he came back home,

384
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:46,720
opening his mouth

385
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:47,640
and waiting

386
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:49,760
for me to feed food into his mouth.

387
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:51,960
I have never seen anyone

388
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,360
who is worse at taking care of himself.

389
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,200
To look for a pair of glasses,

390
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:58,560
he would even check the cupboard.

391
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:02,400
He had stomach problems since a young age.

392
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:05,400
One time, I attended a class reunion.

393
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:07,400
I made some dumplings

394
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:08,960
and put them on the bamboo board.

395
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:10,720
I even wrote him a note

396
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:12,119
telling him

397
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:14,599
to boil the dumplings when he gets back.

398
00:17:14,599 --> 00:17:16,040
Who would've thought

399
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:18,160
he can't even boil?

400
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:21,079
So he ate the medium-rare dumplings

401
00:17:21,079 --> 00:17:22,760
with raw garlic.

402
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:25,040
What do you think happened?

403
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,960
He ended up having gastritis

404
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:29,320
and couldn't eat anything

405
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:31,560
for half a month.

406
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:34,800
He complained about stomachache all day long.

407
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:36,960
Do you think he was in pain?

408
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:39,200
His pain was nothing compared with what I suffered.

409
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:41,560
Whenever I heard his "Ouch" at night,

410
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:43,880
I would get him the medicine

411
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:44,800
and rub his belly.

412
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:47,240
If the pain was too much for him,

413
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:49,160
I would go on the street,

414
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,640
call a cab

415
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:53,680
and take him to the hospital for emergency treatment.

416
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:01,560
You took care of my dad so well.

417
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:03,040
Yeah.

418
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:04,720
Mom,

419
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,560
I've always wanted to ask you this.

420
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,920
The day dad passed away,

421
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,920
you didn't shed a single tear in the hospital.

422
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:15,360
When we bid him the last farewell

423
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:18,000
and buried his ashes, you weren't there either time.

424
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:20,040
On Tomb Sweeping Festivals

425
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:21,400
and his death anniversaries,

426
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,320
you never visited his tomb.

427
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,720
What were you thinking?

428
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,000
None of you has any idea

429
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,560
what your dad looked like when he died.

430
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:36,760
He was intubated all over the body

431
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:41,320
and suffered all the pain on earth.

432
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,240
If it wasn't illegal,

433
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:48,400
I would've pulled out the tubes long ago.

434
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:52,200
In the last week,

435
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:55,960
I cried all my tears

436
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:57,800
and wouldn't cry anymore.

437
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:00,520
I have to say it again.

438
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:02,880
When he was alive,

439
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,360
I treated him well.

440
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,440
When he passes away,

441
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:10,520
I still have to carry on with my life.

442
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:14,040
Even if I cried my heart out,

443
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:16,920
would I be able to bring him back?

444
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:21,200
If I went around with a long face all day long,

445
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:23,640
you would worry about me

446
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:27,360
and I wouldn't have a happy life.

447
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,200
Mom,

448
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,720
you're brilliant.

449
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:34,920
The thing I admire most

450
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,600
is that you know when to let go

451
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,800
If I didn't let go, what could I do?

452
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:44,960
Should I follow him and die?

453
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:47,480
Follow me instead.

454
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:48,480
Let's move to Shenzhen.

455
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:49,600
Shall we?

456
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:50,720
After I retire,

457
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:52,880
I will come back to Beijing with you.

458
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:55,240
When you are not with me,

459
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:58,040
I worry about you and can't have peace of mind.

460
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,600
If I live with you,

461
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,280
I would worry a lot

462
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,600
and wouldn't have peace of mind.

463
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,200
It's been ten years and I'm used to living alone.

464
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:07,080
If I go to your place,

465
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:10,160
would I be able to keep my lifestyle?

466
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,000
Of course, you can.

467
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:13,920
No.

468
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:19,520
I don't want to be an unwanted

469
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:20,200
mother-in-law.

470
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:22,760
What are you talking about?

471
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,840
He won't think of you like that.

472
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:26,360
I told you I won't go.

473
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:27,880
Let's not talk about this anymore.

474
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:28,840
Alright, alright.

475
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:30,000
When you get stubborn,

476
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,160
I can't do anything about it.

477
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,800
Let me show you something.

478
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:36,760
This.

479
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,680
This is called JD Health.

480
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,200
You can find JD family doctor in it.

481
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:44,600
Whenever you feel uncomfortable,

482
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:46,640
you can call or video-call

483
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,400
their doctors and tell them about it.

484
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:53,920
Mommy.

485
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:00,440
My waist.

486
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:01,160
My waist hurts.

487
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:03,360
You're such a kid.

488
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,280
Your mom is almost 50 years old.

489
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,360
You put 50 kilos of your weight on her.

490
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,280
My dear Chengcheng,

491
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:11,120
how is my dear Qidong?

492
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:13,360
He is very well.

493
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:15,000
But he misses you a bit.

494
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,280
Manners, manners.

495
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:18,040
If you don't cover your belly,

496
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:19,160
you will catch a cold.

497
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:20,760
But it's fashion.

498
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:48,800
Did you miss me?

499
00:21:50,270 --> 00:21:52,660
Do you remember my high school classmate Mengmeng?

500
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:53,560
Yeah.

501
00:21:54,590 --> 00:21:56,040
She got her marriage certificate today.

502
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:59,360
Of all my classmates, I'm the only one still not married.

503
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:03,120
But we agreed.

504
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,440
We won't talk about it until I get the Ph.D. degree.

505
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:10,080
I have been waiting since your undergraduate studies

506
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,400
to your post-doctorate degree.

507
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:12,800
You are still telling me to wait.

508
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,120
We agreed.

509
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:17,800
Don't go back on your words.

510
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:26,040
Do you miss me?

511
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:26,880
No.

512
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:28,640
What did you say?

513
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:29,800
No.

514
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:31,600
No?

515
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:32,880
Do you miss me?

516
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:33,920
No.

517
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:35,080
Say it again?

518
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:35,640
Alright.

519
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:47,240
There were at least four dishes for breakfast

520
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:49,120
in my family

521
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:51,640
before I got married.

522
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,400
In your dad's family,

523
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:56,400
there's only a bit of porridge.

524
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,120
They would

525
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:58,200
scrap the pot with a spoon

526
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,120
and make such big noise.

527
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:02,760
Then why did you like dad?

528
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:06,040
To make it sound trendy,

529
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:07,480
he was super talented

530
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:09,600
and his something score is off the chart.

531
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:10,880
Something score?

532
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:11,960
What is it?

533
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:13,920
Face score.

534
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:14,800
That's the word.

535
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:15,640
Face score.

536
00:23:15,850 --> 00:23:17,280
His face score was off the chart.

537
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:18,200
Mom,

538
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:20,680
so you also like handsome guys?

539
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:21,240
Who doesn't?

540
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:23,160
I'm not an ugly woman, after all.

541
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:28,480
In my opinion,

542
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:29,480
Liu Liangzhou

543
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:31,000
is a combination

544
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,280
of a Maths guy and an Arts guy.

545
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:35,320
He has very strong hands-on skills.

546
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:37,120
When we were in the same team,

547
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:38,840
we came across many dysfunctional problems

548
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:40,360
from a big generator

549
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:41,760
to a small selfie stick.

550
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:42,640
As long as it's a mechanical problem,

551
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,120
he always managed to fix it.

552
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:47,280
If you live together with a guy like this,

553
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:49,360
he will be of great help.

554
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:51,720
What does it have to do with me?

555
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,360
I'm sleepy because I ate too much.

556
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:01,280
I'll go upstairs and lie on the bed.

557
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:03,080
I'll do the same.

558
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:04,480
Both of us will be scolded.

559
00:24:05,450 --> 00:24:08,320
I'm just washing the dishes. Why do you have to 
 make it such a big deal?

560
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,760
Do you think I call you my elder sister for nothing?

561
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:11,280
Elder sister.

562
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:12,560
You can be my elder sister too.

563
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,120
Come on.

564
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:18,360
The task will get easier if the two of us help each other.

565
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:19,360
Right?

566
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:20,520
Finish washing the dishes now

567
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:22,160
and watch dramas in my room.

568
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:25,080
Come on.

569
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,040
I don't want to go back to the dormitory.

570
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:36,720
You have to.

571
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:39,520
Don't you know what they all say?

572
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:42,680
If you live together before getting married, 
 you'll soon be tired of each other.

573
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:45,280
These couples usually break up before getting married.

574
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:48,240
Who said it?

575
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,080
It's just how the saying goes.

576
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:51,760
Who is the saying?

577
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:52,680
I don't know him.

578
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:54,440
I don't care. I'm going to sleep.

579
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:56,800
Stop it.

580
00:24:58,880 --> 00:24:59,640
Come on.

581
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:04,840
I have ironed your clothes.

582
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:06,000
Take a shower

583
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,360
and come back here next week.

584
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:08,520
Just one night.

585
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:10,840
Come on, it's just one night.

586
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:12,400
No.

587
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:14,560
One night will become one month.

588
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:16,160
And then it will go on to one year.

589
00:25:16,570 --> 00:25:18,960
We can have our whole life together after marriage.

590
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,470
We can afford to not stay together tonight.

591
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:24,520
Come on.

592
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:28,760
Go now.

593
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:32,480
Are you going or not?

594
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:44,920
Sister.

595
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,800
Why are you looking at me so suspiciously?

596
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:57,640
Dear sister,

597
00:25:58,040 --> 00:26:00,080
do you have 50,000 euros?

598
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:02,760
What do you want?

599
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:06,120
A friend of mine

600
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:07,680
is doing fundraising for a restaurant.

601
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:09,440
She wants me to be a shareholder.

602
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:10,680
Did you invest?

603
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:11,920
I am planning to.

604
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:15,160
Opening a restaurant is way less profitable than 
 investing in stocks.

605
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:17,200
But investing in stocks is way less fun.

606
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:18,520
Also,

607
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:20,400
I have no idea how to play the stock market.

608
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:23,160
Do you have money?

609
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:24,640
No.

610
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:27,680
You say it with such confidence.

611
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:29,960
Then why are you making these plans?

612
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,920
I want you to join it.

613
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:37,960
Come on, mind your own business.

614
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:43,480
Exactly, life should be a vibrant business.

615
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,240
Should I live my life like you?

616
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:47,520
Check yourself.

617
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,040
I can see continence from your face.

618
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:50,400
You're already in old lady mode.

619
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,320
What's the point of living a life like this?

620
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:54,800
Suppose there's no point, should I suicide?

621
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:55,560
I didn't mean that.

622
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,360
What I mean

623
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:00,120
is you should make your life more interesting.

624
00:27:03,930 --> 00:27:05,640
How do you define an interesting life?

625
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:08,160
Opening a restaurant.

626
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:10,960
I'm not business material.

627
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,120
I forbid your self-denial.

628
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:13,640
You went abroad for graduate studies.

629
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:16,000
It's proof that you're so much cleverer than me.

630
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
It's not the same.

631
00:27:18,390 --> 00:27:19,920
But I don't think that's what matters.

632
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:21,200
The problem is

633
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:21,920
you're lazy.

634
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,440
Congratulations on getting it right.

635
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:26,840
I am lazy.

636
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:29,280
It's tiring to open a restaurant and make a profit.

637
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:30,600
You have to be diligent.

638
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:32,160
I can never do that.

639
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:35,320
It's such a big world.

640
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:37,880
Just get out of bed and experience more, sister.

641
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:39,320
What do you want me to experience?

642
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:41,840
I do not believe

643
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:43,960
a bunch of women can run a restaurant well.

644
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:47,400
I can't just throw away that money.

645
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,440
After all,

646
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,720
I spent five years earning it when I was young.

647
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:54,600
Then it's another reason why you shouldn't 
 put it in the bank.

648
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:56,040
Can you bear seeing it

649
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:57,920
devaluating every day?

650
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:01,000
Don't you think about my money!

651
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:02,800
But I won't waste it.

652
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:03,560
It's an investment.

653
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:05,080
Money begets money.

654
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:06,160
You only have 50,000 euros.

655
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:07,800
It's not enough for the rest of your life, right?

656
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:09,400
You're such a miser.

657
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,760
What's wrong with being a miser?

658
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:14,640
At least I can keep the money.

659
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:16,400
It's always better than if you can't keep it.

660
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:19,240
I have no relatives and I live under other's roofs.

661
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:20,720
If I waste that money,

662
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:22,400
I'll have to kill myself.

663
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,240
You won't end up like that.

664
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,640
Nothing you say will change my mind.

665
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:27,200
I told you I'm not investing and I won't.

666
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:35,000
How about this?

667
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,000
Lend me the money.

668
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:36,600
No.

669
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:39,640
I will pay interest.

670
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:41,840
I will pay more than the banks pay you.

671
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:43,920
How about 15 percent?

672
00:28:47,510 --> 00:28:48,720
If you don't lend me the money,

673
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,480
I will ask the bank for a loan.

674
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:51,720
Their interest rate is lower.

675
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,040
How much do you want?

676
00:28:58,720 --> 00:28:59,590
300,000 RMB.

677
00:28:59,590 --> 00:29:01,040
I'll pay you back in one year.

678
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:03,000
Interest included, how much is it?

679
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,200
345,000 RMB.

680
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:08,040
You're brilliant.

681
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:10,400
What if you can't pay me back?

682
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:14,160
I will sell the house and get the money.

683
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:17,440
A statement doesn't count as a binding contract.

684
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:19,760
I hereby offer an IOU.

685
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:28,560
What are these that you got?

686
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:30,560
New skincare products.

687
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:32,200
It's a whole set of INGLEMIREPHARM'S products.

688
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:33,920
I heard it's an activating product

689
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:35,220
that helps brighten the skin.

690
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:37,520
I think I should treat myself better

691
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:39,560
and be positive in life.

692
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:42,640
You should've done that a long time ago.

693
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:44,520
When the restaurant is open

694
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:46,520
and you stand in front of it,

695
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:48,400
people will think it's a salon

696
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:49,920
if they don't know it's a restaurant.

697
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:51,480
Your skin is luminous.

698
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:54,720
It's time to talk about some serious stuff.

699
00:29:54,910 --> 00:29:56,720
We have to decide the name of our restaurant.

700
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:57,920
I need to register it.

701
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:03,560
All shareholders are women.

702
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:04,880
How about "Women's Session"?

703
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:05,480
There you go.

704
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:07,360
It really sounds like a salon.

705
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:08,500
Or a postpartum care center,

706
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:09,040
if not a salon.

707
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:10,200
We'll take the naming job from you.

708
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:12,120
What on earth was the name you came up with?

709
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:13,240
Bao Xue, give us an idea.

710
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,360
Don't make me do it.

711
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:16,040
OK?

712
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:17,880
I really can't think of anything.

713
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:18,760
Opening a restaurant

714
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:20,720
is too far away from my ideal of becoming

715
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,800
a performance artist.

716
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:24,480
It's like walking at an intersection.

717
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:27,120
I really have no idea at all.

718
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:35,160
Let's call it Intersection Bistro.

719
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:36,480
How about that?

720
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:39,000
Intersection Bistro.

721
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,680
Intersection Bistro.

722
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:41,920
To put it simply,

723
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,160
the name means

724
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:45,000
that we do dishes of all places.

725
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,960
But if you think more about it,

726
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:48,480
in many cases,

727
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:49,400
the ways of life

728
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:50,720
women choose in the beginning

729
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:53,220
are almost always completely different from 
 the lives we live.

730
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:55,200
It's just like going the wrong way in an intersection.

731
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,440
That's quite deep.

732
00:30:56,650 --> 00:30:57,760
But Intersection Bistro

733
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:59,680
doesn't really sound like a restaurant.

734
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:02,470
At least it's better than names like 
 House of Happiness, Fortune or Spring.

735
00:31:02,470 --> 00:31:03,430
It's just my idea.

736
00:31:03,430 --> 00:31:04,760
We can think of something else.

737
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:06,120
Intersection Bistro.

738
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:08,360
But the word intersection

739
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:10,160
feels a bit internal and not appealing.

740
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:12,200
How about we call it

741
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:14,120
Crossroad Bistro?

742
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:16,320
Crossroad Bistro.

743
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:17,600
It's a bit weird.

744
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:18,880
Weird?

745
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,720
I think it's okay to sound weird.

746
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:23,280
People remember weird names better.

747
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:25,520
Crossroad Bistro.

748
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:27,360
I think it will work.

749
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:29,400
Crossroad Bistro, it is.

750
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:31,680
Let's vote.

751
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:33,960
OK.

752
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:34,880
Alright, come on.

753
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:36,310
Give me your identity cards

754
00:31:36,310 --> 00:31:38,360
and transfer the investment to the account I gave you.

755
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:39,960
I have prepared these a long time ago.

756
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:41,600
I even stole my sister's identity card.

757
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:42,360
Be quick.

758
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:42,880
OK.

759
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:45,160
Are you sure your sister won't call the police 
 and arrest you?

760
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:46,000
I am most certain.

761
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,240
I know her well.

762
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:49,200
She won't do that.

763
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:53,600
Aunt.

764
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:54,200
You're back.

765
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:55,200
Grandpa.

766
00:31:59,000 --> 00:31:59,520
Sister.

767
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:00,160
Come over.

768
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:01,480
I need to show you something.

769
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:06,720
What is it?

770
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:08,360
Come here.

771
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:20,200
Congratulations.

772
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:22,000
You have a business now.

773
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,120
The same goes for you.

774
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:24,280
Congratulations.

775
00:32:28,230 --> 00:32:30,560
Did you make me a shareholder with the money I lent you?

776
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:31,400
What do you think?

777
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:32,920
Isn't it a pleasant surprise?

778
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:35,200
Did you ask for my approval?

779
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,000
I did.

780
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:36,960
You refused.

781
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:38,740
Then why did you do it knowing that I disagree?

782
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:40,320
Sister.

783
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:41,920
This is a great chance

784
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:43,720
to earn money and support yourself.

785
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:45,840
Others can't get this chance at all even if they try hard.

786
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:47,400
I pulled some strings

787
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:49,080
to get the chance for you.

788
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:50,480
But I don't want this.

789
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:51,200
I'm telling you.

790
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,200
Get me out of this right now

791
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:53,290
and give me my money back.

792
00:32:53,290 --> 00:32:54,080
Take it easy.

793
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:55,880
Listen to me, okay?

794
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:57,440
If we earn money from the restaurant,

795
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:59,000
you can have the shares.

796
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,160
If we lose money,

797
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:01,960
the shares are mine.

798
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:02,600
One year later,

799
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:03,640
I will pay you back in full

800
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:05,120
with interest included.

801
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:06,240
How about this?

802
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:09,880
Sister, we grew up together.

803
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:11,600
Have I ever gone back on my promises?

804
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:12,360
Right?

805
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:16,160
Also, you have our contract.

806
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:17,360
We put it down in black and white.

807
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:19,560
You won't get the short end of the stick.

808
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:21,120
Why did you do that?

809
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:23,000
How dare you make the decision for me!

810
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,680
That's just because you won't make the decision for yourself.

811
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:27,400
Ever since you were a kid, you have been so stupid

812
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:30,080
with money that you can even smash a dent on the ground.

813
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:31,080
A dent is so boring.

814
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:33,240
I would dig a well.

815
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:35,000
Then I will put up a notice next to the well,

816
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:35,640
saying

817
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:37,720
don't forget to thank the one who made the well.

818
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:41,240
But you've pushed me into the well now.

819
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:45,720
Sister, to be honest,

820
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:47,520
I did it for your own good.

821
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:49,600
That's my least favorite sentence.

822
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:51,680
What do you mean by for my own good?

823
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:53,440
Do you have any idea what I consider as good?

824
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:55,000
Getting something for nothing.

825
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:58,320
Who said I'm getting something for nothing?

826
00:33:58,320 --> 00:33:59,080
Tell me,

827
00:33:59,080 --> 00:33:59,970
can you get me out of this?

828
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:01,600
No.

829
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:08,440
You make me so anxious.

830
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:14,120
Come on.

831
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:16,199
Don't be upset, Dai Xiaoyu.

832
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:19,120
Know that eventually, you will tell the story

833
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:21,719
that upset you in the past with a smile.

834
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:24,679
I can't vent my anger

835
00:34:24,679 --> 00:34:25,760
even if I kick you.

836
00:34:26,199 --> 00:34:27,080
Alright.

837
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:28,050
Kick me if you want.

838
00:34:28,050 --> 00:34:30,440
If you're cruel enough to kick a sister 
 who treats you so well,

839
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:31,199
then do it.

840
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:32,239
I believe you will admire my

841
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:33,679
clever decision before long.

842
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:34,880
Kick me.

843
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:36,120
I will...

844
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:40,639
Why did you slap me for real?

845
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:47,920
The only thing you invest in is the building.

846
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:49,880
Then you have 70 percent of the shares.

847
00:34:52,679 --> 00:34:53,800
Around this place,

848
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,440
the monthly rent of such a big building

849
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:57,240
is at least 120,000 RMB.

850
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:59,160
The annual rent is 1,440,000 RMB.

851
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:01,160
I made a rough calculation.

852
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:02,080
The decorations

853
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:03,840
will cost approximately over one million RMB.

854
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:05,840
The cost of these two is three million RMB.

855
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:07,560
I haven't added the operation cost.

856
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:09,000
The three of you

857
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,600
invest 900,000 in total.

858
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:12,200
I will pay for all the rest.

859
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:15,240
Now it makes sense.

860
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:17,480
To tell you the truth,

861
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:19,880
I'm not expecting to earn money from the restaurant.

862
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:22,120
I just want a convenient place for meeting friends.

863
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:22,760
But of course,

864
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:23,440
it's a business

865
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:24,520
after all.

866
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:25,720
I won't just leave it there.

867
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:27,320
I can't think of it in the same way.

868
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:28,920
I can't earn money from doing anything else.

869
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:31,120
The restaurant is all I can count on

870
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:33,120
to earn money and support myself.

871
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:34,040
It's the same with me.

872
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:36,080
When the restaurant is open, I will work full time

873
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:37,000
and do nothing else.

874
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:39,400
What about you?

875
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:40,320
Me?

876
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:43,510
I have prepared for the worst.

877
00:35:43,510 --> 00:35:44,560
If it's a losing business,

878
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:45,760
I will think of it

879
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,800
as the cost of experiencing life.

880
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:48,440
I see.

881
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:51,020
We should never trust her

882
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:52,480
with the operations of the restaurant.

883
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:53,680
She already plans her way out.

884
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:56,640
We made an agreement long ago.

885
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:58,160
I am the spokeswoman of the restaurant.

886
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:00,080
I make the investment, but I won't run the business.

887
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:01,000
Are you a mascot?

888
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:04,760
How about you, Xiaoyu?

889
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:06,040
I don't know how to operate a business,

890
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:07,480
so I won't be a manager.

891
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:09,840
However, I can supervise the managing department

892
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:11,560
so that I will know how my money is spent.

893
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:13,640
Feel free to supervise.

894
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:15,040
Feng Xi.

895
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:15,880
Yes?

896
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:17,360
Since you offer yourself,

897
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:19,160
we will trust you with

898
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:21,080
the bistro's management.

899
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:24,440
If anything goes wrong,

900
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:25,240
tell me.

901
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:26,840
We will solve it in shareholders' meetings.

902
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:28,160
OK.

903
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:29,440
I will do my best.

904
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:36,080
Have you gone through

905
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:37,160
the formalities

906
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:39,440
on fire, hygiene and taxes?

907
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:41,440
We don't have to worry about these.

908
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:43,240
You Shanshan has arranged for people to do these.

909
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:44,360
Don't worry.

910
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:46,400
Why do you trust her so much?

911
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:47,800
We come from the same place.

912
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:51,600
Don't you know that

913
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:53,320
family members and people like you are the first

914
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:54,960
to be tricked by a pyramid scheme

915
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:56,680
You are so paranoid.

916
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:59,880
You Shanshan is the most trustworthy person around me.

917
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:03,000
Give me an example.

918
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,920
She helped me earn most of my investment

919
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:07,240
in the stock market.

920
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:08,240
Really?

921
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,120
Her instincts are accurate.

922
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:11,840
As far as I know,

923
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:14,080
she probably never had a losing business.

924
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:17,360
You're not with her all day long.

925
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:19,240
Even if she lost money, she won't tell you.

926
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:20,720
Only the result matters to me.

927
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:23,000
I also know her other clients.

928
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,880
Everyone is willing to entrust her with stocks.

929
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:26,280
We never lose money.

930
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:26,880
Yeah.

931
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:28,760
Once she senses any risks,

932
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:30,040
she gets the money back immediately.

933
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:31,170
She's very accurate about it.

934
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:32,840
I always feel

935
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:35,000
an expert is helping her with it.

936
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:36,320
Is there an expert?

937
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:37,680
I don't think so.

938
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:49,080
I'm so hungry.

939
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:49,680
I'm so tired.

940
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:50,520
I'm so pissed.

941
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:51,480
Come on. Let's have dinner.

942
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:53,040
It's my treat.

943
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:53,840
Let's have a hotpot.

944
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:54,800
Tell Bao Xue to come.

945
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:55,360
OK.

946
00:37:59,400 --> 00:37:59,920
Come on.

947
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:01,000
Cheers.

948
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,720
Drink Langjiu Liquor when you eat a hotpot,

949
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:04,760
you shall have a nice husband.

950
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:05,640
Cheers.

951
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:06,240
Cheers.

952
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:11,440
Whenever you mention the word husband,

953
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:13,320
I worry for Feng Xi.

954
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:14,520
Do you remember Mengmeng?

955
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:15,460
Even she got married.

956
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:17,560
I've prepared money as your wedding gift long ago.

957
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:19,320
When can I give it to you?

958
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:21,000
Can't you just be kind

959
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:21,960
and comfort me a bit?

960
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:23,760
Let me comfort you.

961
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:26,760
How about

962
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:28,080
I tell you the truth now?

963
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:29,600
I think you

964
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:31,200
don't really want to get married.

965
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:32,160
Nonsense.

966
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:33,480
I've been waiting for 10 years.

967
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:35,280
There's another explanation for the waiting,

968
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:36,640
which is not taking action.

969
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:38,440
In terms of marrying,

970
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:39,600
if both the man and the woman

971
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:40,600
want to do it,

972
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:41,720
they can get the certificate

973
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:43,040
for nine RMB any moment.

974
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:45,880
You don't have to wait for ten years at all.

975
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:47,040
The truth is that

976
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:48,200
you've been waiting

977
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:49,480
not for a marriage,

978
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:51,080
but for a new start

979
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:53,000
to change the lives you are living now.

980
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:54,800
I don't think

981
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:57,560
there's love left between the two of you.

982
00:38:57,560 --> 00:38:59,760
You're just used to waiting together.

983
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:02,480
Shan, come on.

984
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:04,800
Would it kill you to say something nice?

985
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:05,960
Are you for real?

986
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:07,200
It won't kill me.

987
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:08,960
But it will kill Feng Xi.

988
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:12,440
She will die of stupidity if all she hears 
 are nice words.

989
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:14,160
She always talks like that to me.

990
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:15,760
She always pokes a hole in my heart

991
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:16,960
through every accurate word

992
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:19,360
and then puts a bandage on it.

993
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:21,170
That's because you are too dumb.

994
00:39:21,170 --> 00:39:22,690
I need to tell you the truth from time to time.

995
00:39:22,690 --> 00:39:24,600
Maybe there's less than ten percent of a chance

996
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:25,880
I can make you realize the truth.

997
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:27,040
If my words don't hurt,

998
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:28,320
you will fall asleep just looking at

999
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:29,760
traffic signals at a crossroad.

1000
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:33,240
Listen, Feng Xi.

1001
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:34,840
I believe

1002
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:36,760
that you and Li Xiang

1003
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:37,360
must have

1004
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:39,080
loved each other in the beginning.

1005
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:39,680
Right?

1006
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:41,240
But when it goes on for ten years,

1007
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:42,960
it has become a habit long ago.

1008
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:44,040
Right now,

1009
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:44,760
he is tepid

1010
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:45,640
and almost unconcerned.

1011
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:46,120
In my opinion,

1012
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:47,760
you're not his girlfriend at all.

1013
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,760
You're just his free nanny

1014
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:52,120
taking care of all his daily needs.

1015
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:53,360
He knows it too well.

1016
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:54,080
Do you know?

1017
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:55,520
This is a losing business.

1018
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:56,920
No girls would do it.

1019
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:58,480
Stop this nonsense.

1020
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:00,120
Li Xiang is not what you think.

1021
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:03,720
Your IQ is lower than the horizon

1022
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:05,160
and it remains there.

1023
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:07,520
Not even a level 12 tornado can plug you out.

1024
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:09,960
I've had enough of you, You Shanshan.

1025
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:10,900
So what?

1026
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:12,120
Boil the tripes for 20 seconds.

1027
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:13,080
I will break with you.

1028
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:18,040
Feng Xi,

1029
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:19,760
do you have any conscience?

1030
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,480
We've known each other for so long.

1031
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:26,760
How many times have said you want to break with me?

1032
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:28,320
At least a hundred times.

1033
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:30,120
Show me your determination and do it for real.

1034
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,440
But before doing that,

1035
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:33,160
at least

1036
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:34,440
pay the bill first.

1037
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:35,960
You said we should have the hotpot.

1038
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:45,120
You can still be saved.

1039
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:46,520
You can tell who really cares for you.

1040
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:47,880
Good. Congratulations.

1041
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:50,680
Waiter.

1042
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:52,000
Duck blood, please.

1043
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:52,840
OK.

1044
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:56,040
Don't just eat.

1045
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:58,240
You have to participate.

1046
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:00,960
Tell me if I am right.

1047
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:03,960
I don't know much about it,

1048
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:05,040
so I shouldn't comment.

1049
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:08,480
Shan, in my opinion...

1050
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:10,920
What do you think?

1051
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:14,040
I think there's something

1052
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:16,320
really amazing about you.

1053
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:18,920
You can put a relationship problem

1054
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:20,080
in the context of the market

1055
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:21,680
within the shortest amount of time.

1056
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:23,680
Isn't it nice?

1057
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:24,800
Simple and to the point.

1058
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:25,600
Right?

1059
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:28,240
Of course not.

1060
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:31,320
On the market,

1061
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:33,800
it just about supply and demand.

1062
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:36,920
Fundamentally, there is nothing wrong with it.

1063
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:40,160
However, the trickiest problem

1064
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:41,840
in a relationship

1065
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:43,120
is the emotions.

1066
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:45,720
It's way beyond all supplies and demands.

1067
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:47,920
If you always mix the two together,

1068
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:49,640
people will think you are

1069
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:53,000
are a utilitarian.

1070
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:00,440
Maybe it's a bit too much to say it like that.

1071
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:01,440
Am I a utilitarian?

1072
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:03,880
Am I like that to you guys?

1073
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:05,720
I don't agree with you at all.

1074
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:06,280
Listen to me,

1075
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:07,120
a long term

1076
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:09,320
and stable relationship

1077
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:11,080
has to be like supply and demand.

1078
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:14,200
You need to give your partner all he wants in terms of

1079
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:15,880
spiritual needs,

1080
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:16,400
money

1081
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:17,640
and companionship.

1082
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:18,320
Am I right?

1083
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:19,720
Only when you know his demands

1084
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:21,000
can you supply the right things.

1085
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:21,800
Right?

1086
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:23,560
You also need to know your demands.

1087
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:24,640
Figure it out.

1088
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:25,880
It won't take away any of your time

1089
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:27,440
offering unconditional love.

1090
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:28,880
I completely put myself

1091
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:30,320
in her shoes.

1092
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:31,840
Then you think I'm a utilitarian.

1093
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:38,640
Am I like that?

1094
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:39,520
This is

1095
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:42,320
exactly what I meant.

1096
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:43,320
Do you know?

1097
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:44,320
Honestly,

1098
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:45,160
it is

1099
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:46,840
easy to misunderstand you.

1100
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:49,360
From what I saw in you during this period,

1101
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:51,680
I can see that you're not a utilitarian.

1102
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:53,360
Look.

1103
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:55,200
Look at this artist.

1104
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:56,760
She is incisive.

1105
00:42:57,400 --> 00:42:58,880
But your words are utilitarian.

1106
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:00,480
Don't make her look good.

1107
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:01,680
She is a dickhead.

1108
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:02,560
Feng Xi.

1109
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:04,280
I've told you you picked the wrong man long ago.

1110
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:06,720
I've made my way out.

1111
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:08,120
No one can trick me anymore.
