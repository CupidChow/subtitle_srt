Sir,

4
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,440
are you tired?

5
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:04,760
I'm fine.

00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,920
How is she, Doctor?

7
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,240
We must remove her uterus.

8
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,120
All right?

9
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:12,440
How is she?

10
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:14,240
Get out of here right now.

If my uncle

knows what really happened,

13
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,120
he'll just kill you.

14
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:19,880
I'll come tomorrow.

15
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:20,920
Get out.

00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:21,840

00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,920
do your parents know about you and Henan?

Everyone in your family is so kind.

Over the past few days,

22
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:35,640
sometimes I got confused

23
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:37,360
and forgot it was not real.

24
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,600
I want to go to Crossroad Bistro tomorrow

25

to help You Shanshan with her business.

26
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:42,240
Sure.

27
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:43,680
This is my friend Si Meng.

00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:45,680
She will help with the business in the next few days.

Let's make a toast.

35
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,320
Mr. Chai,

36
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:09,040
why didn't you bring Xiaoyu today?

37
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,960
I called her, but she didn't pick up.

38
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:12,680
Then, I thought, I'm having dinner with Mr. Ma

39
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:13,800
instead of any client.

40
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:14,400
Right.

41
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,040
So that's fine.

42
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,840
Then you made a mistake.

43
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:18,880
Without Xiaoyu,

44
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,720
you'll get wasted sooner than Mr. Ma.

45
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:21,560
That's true.

46
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:22,800
He can actually drink.

47
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:24,600
Shanshan,

48
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:25,600
tell you what,

49
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:26,800
have you noticed

50
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,240
that everyone drinks less in a business dinner?

51
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:31,320
Why?

52
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:32,720
Because everyone is careful.

53
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,760
They are afraid of falling into a trap.

54
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,320
Therefore,

55
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:40,240
it's always easier to have dinner with friends.

56
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,640
We can drink as much as we want,

57
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:42,440
right?

Such an honor.

65
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,480
Shanshan, I feel that you're not yourself today.

66
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,160
You drank even less than me.

67
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,200
Why do you look so disoriented?

68
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,760
She's just tired.

69
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:05,520
Actually, that's not the only reason.

70
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,920
Feng Xi took some days off.

71
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,840
So I had to be here every day.

72
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:11,200
I thought

73
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:14,000
that nothing goes wrong
even if I have eight companies.

74
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,560
Let alone a restaurant.

75
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:18,200
But then, everything turned out wrong.

76
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,120
Everyone has their own area of expertise.

77
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:23,120
Even though you have eight companies,

78
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,840
your teams are well-trained.

79
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,640
So you only need to tell them what to do.

80
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:27,960
What is catering?

81
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,680
It covers everything.

82
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,360
It requires hard work.

83
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,440
Most of the time, you're a hands-off boss.

84
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,560
Why do you think you can do this?

85
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:36,400
You're right.

86
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,720
In the last couple of days,

87
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,960
I was suddenly impressed
by what Feng Xi had been doing.

88
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,520
It's not something that anyone can do.

89
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,800
She has been doing this for a year or so.

90
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,080
I must make a toast to her now.

91
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:45,880
Me too.

92
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:46,680
To Feng Xi.

93
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,240
Even though I haven't met Feng Xi,

94
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,159
I'd like to drink to her, too.

95
00:04:49,159 --> 00:04:50,400
Here, let's raise our glasses.

96
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,280
To Feng Xi.

97
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,040
Shanshan,

98
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,880
you have eight companies?

99
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,000
Tell you what, Mr. Ma,

100
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:00,840
this friend of mine

101
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,160
is just talented in every way.

102
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,160
Mm.

103
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,840
I'm a nobody compared with Mr. Ma.

104
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,280
Mr. Ma, Mr. Chai told me

105
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:10,920
that you created a miracle the first time

106
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,120
you entered show business.

107
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:16,040
He bought four novels at a low price

108
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,280
and all of them went viral.

109
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,880
He made loads of money

110
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,080
by selling the rights of adaptation.

111
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,040
I was just lucky.

112
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:23,960
It was luck.

113
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,600
Come on.

114
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,800
We all do business.

115
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,200
We know better than others
that there isn't such thing as luck.

116
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,840
It's all about your ability.

117
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,800
There's nothing wrong

118
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,240
with Shanshan's words.

119
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:37,000
Why is Mr. Ma successful in this field?

120
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:40,640
Because he is a middle-aged art boy himself.

121
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:42,920
Right, middle-aged.

122
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,960
He is a bookworm.

123
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:46,440
Therefore, as soon as he reads it,

124
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,960
he'll know whether it's a good story or not.

125
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,440
It sounds like

126
00:05:51,159 --> 00:05:53,080
an opportunity is right in front of me.

127
00:05:53,159 --> 00:05:54,040
What do you mean?

128
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,920
This friend of mine is a woman of letters.

129
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,120
She writes fairy tales.

130
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:00,800
Mr. Ma,

131
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,560
could you take a look at her works

132
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:04,520
and give her a chance if there's any?

133
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:05,480
Of course.

134
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:06,640
No problem at all.

135
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:08,000
Thanks, Mr. Ma.

136
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,080
Cheers.

137
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:14,800
Take it slow.

138
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,400
I can't drive you home today.

139
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:18,960
I rarely have a chance to relax.

140
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,120
The last time I got drunk

141
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,760
was before I had my second child.

142

She reminds me of the old days.

143

Mr. Ma,

144
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,400
when we were fresh out of college,

145
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,800
each time we got together,

146
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,760
remember what we did after getting drunk?

147
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,680
Reciting poems.

148
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,520
We could just do that all night.

149
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:41,120
We laughed and cried as we recited poems.

150
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,840
How young we were!

151
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:43,640
Absolutely.

152
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:44,800
The good old days.

153
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,480
Back then, before we got together for dinner,

154
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,280
we had to prepare three days in advance

155
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,520
in case we went out of poems.

156
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:54,240
That's right.

157
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,520
Mr. Chai,

158
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:57,080
I didn't know

159
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:58,720
this side of you.

160
00:06:59,080 --> 00:06:59,840
Tell you what, Shanshan,

161
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,040
you underestimated me.

162
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:03,080
When I was young,

163
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:04,600
I had all poems at my fingertips.

164
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:06,560
Back in college,

165
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:08,680
you know,

166
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,880
a lot of girls

167
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,640
pursued me.

168
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,360
For what?

169
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,480
To beat you up?

170
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:17,960
He's not bragging.

171
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,080
He was really popular at that time.

172
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,080
So popular.

173
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:22,120
To be honest,

174
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,200
a line of girls were waiting to pursue him.

175
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,280
He was too busy to deal with everyone.

176
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,120
I was really busy.

177
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,280
What about now?

178
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:28,920
Mr. Chai is just as popular as before.

179
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:29,760
He's still got it.

180
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:30,680
Not bad.

181
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:31,840
Let me tell you something, Shanshan.

182
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:34,040
Let me show you my talent.

183
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:35,240
Please.

184
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,480
Listen carefully.

185
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,440
"How many

186
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:43,720
loved your moments of glad grace,

187
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:47,520
And loved your beauty with love false

188
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:49,840
or true."

189
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,240
He's looking at you fondly.

190
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:52,600
Who wrote it?

191
00:07:53,159 --> 00:07:53,800
Who?

192
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,400
Don't stop. Go on.

193
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,880
I forgot the lines. But who?

194
00:07:57,159 --> 00:07:58,800
Don't tell me it's Zhao Zhao.

195
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,480
Do you really think I didn't go to college?

196
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,040
It's Yeats' poem.

197
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:04,760
Good.

198
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,360
Don't praise her yet.

199
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,640
It was an easy one.

200
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,040
So easy.

201
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,000
Let me give you a hard one.

202
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,440
Wait a minute.

203
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:14,360
You can save yours for later.

204
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,640
Let me do an easy one.

205
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:16,800
Please.

206
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,280
"A ragged urchin,

207
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:22,800
aimless and alone,

208
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,520
Loitered about that vacancy;

209
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:25,800
a bird

210
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:29,240
Flew up to safety from his well-aimed stone."

211
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:31,680
I know this one.

212
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,799
Is it…

213
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:33,320
Wait.

214
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,280
Don't say it.

215
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,000
Who?

216
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:36,679
I'm so close. Don't say it. It's…

217
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:37,960
W. H. Auden.

218
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,120
The Shield of Achilles.

219
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,120
Right, W. H. Auden.

220
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:42,360
I was about to say it.

221
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:42,960
All right.

222
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,200
Stop it.

223
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,240
Don't pretend.

224
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:46,880
See?

225
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:47,800
I didn't brag at all.

226
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,160
She is good.

227
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,360
Four years of Chinese literature
is not a waste of time.

228
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,160
Absolutely.

229
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:54,160
"We had dreams back then,

230
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,040
About literature,

231
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,240
About love,

232
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,880
About a journey across the world.

233
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,880
Now deep into the night we drink,

234
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:05,160
With the clattering sound of glasses

235
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:08,640
And that of shattered dreams."

236
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:09,720
The Visitor from Poland.

237
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,400
Bei Dao.

238
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,440
All right.

239
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,640
Another round.

240
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:15,320
Come on.

241
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,560
You must drink two cups.

242
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:17,320
Two, of course.

243
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:22,040
"Time and the bell

244
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:23,960
have buried the day,

245
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,480
The black cloud carries the sun away.

246
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:29,160
Will the sunflower turn to us."

247
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,120
No, it won't.

248
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:32,640
I don't know this one.

249
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:34,840
T. S. Eliot.

250
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:36,680
Yeah.

251
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,800
Come on. Let's drink to this one.

252
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,640
Here's to the poet.

253
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,120
Cheers.

254
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:46,960
Honey.

255
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:47,640
You're finally here.

256
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:48,800
What are you doing here?

257
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,200
Let me introduce him. This is Du Shijun.

258
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:52,800
Du Shijun.

259
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:53,680
We met before.

260
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:54,640
I'm Chai Yong.

261
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:55,440
This is my husband.

262
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:56,320
Mr. Chai.

263
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,160
Haven't seen you for a while.

264
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:58,600
Let me introduce you two.

265
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,000
This is Mr. Ma.

266
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:00,880
We went to the same college.

267
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:02,680
Take a seat.

268
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:04,360
Why are you here?

269
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,280
How much have you drunk?

270
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:06,720
I assume she's got depressed

271
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:07,840
as she always stays at home.

272
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:08,680
Shut up.

273
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:10,360
I'm not depressed at all.

274
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,720
I'm so happy.

275
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:13,560
Let me tell you something.

276
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,280
My husband loves me so much.

277
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:17,800
He even transferred

278
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,240
to another department for me.

279
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,120
Am I right?

280
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:22,920
Mr. Du,

281
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:23,920
you know what,

282
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:26,320
your wife is so talented.

283
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:29,120
She reads a lot.

284
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,440
We were reciting poems.

285
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,400
She knows

286
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,600
much more

287
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,120
than both of us together.

288
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,320
I'm so humbled.

289
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,120
I'm really impressed.

290
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:39,160
Look how I beat them.

291
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,320
Still not enough?

292
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:42,600
You've been beating us all night.

293
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,600
She's the Thanos of the world of poetry.

294
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:46,200
"Fresh blows the wind

295
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,480
To the homeland.

296
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,000
My Irish child,

297
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,360
Where are you waiting?"

298
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:53,440
Who wrote it?

299
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:54,920
It's…

300
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:56,880
Isn't it…

301
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:57,920
T.S. Eliot.

302
00:10:58,680 --> 00:10:59,960
The Waste Land.

303
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:00,800
Right.

304
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,400
They got it.

305
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,240
I'll drink.

306
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:05,360
Let's drink this one together.

307
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,320
Cheers.

308
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:09,120
All right. That's enough.

309
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:11,920
Shall we stop right here?

310
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,200
I'll give you another one.

311
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,400
Leave me alone. I'm not drunk.

312
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,960
"I have measured out my life

313
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:22,320
with coffee spoons;

314
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:25,080
I know the voices dying with a dying fall

315
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:29,240
Beneath the music from a farther room."

316
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:31,280
Who wrote it?

317
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:32,120
It's…

318
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:34,240
Wait a second…

319
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,160
I bet you don't know this one.

320
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:36,480
This is an improvisation by Si Meng.

321
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:39,240
Don't be ridiculous.

322
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,480
Let me tell you.

323
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,320
It's also by T.S. Eliot.

324
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,040
Why do you like him so much?

325
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,280
You've recited all his poems the whole evening.

326
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,800
His wife was a dancer.

327
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:49,880
Definitely.

328
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,040
I've got one.

329
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,320
It was mentioned a lot in the movie Interstellar.

330
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:01,440
"Do not go…"

331
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:03,800
What's next?

332
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:07,040
"Do not go gentle into your night."

333
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:07,960
No.

334
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:10,400
"Do not go gentle into that good night."

335
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:12,720
Dylan Thomas.

336
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,040
Bingo.

337
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:14,640
Raise your glasses.

338
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,320
Bottoms up, and let's call it a night.

339
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:17,560
She's so talented.

340
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:18,200
Cheers.

341
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,320
I got her.

342
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,200
Cheers.

343
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,400
What a wonderful evening.

344
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:23,480
A feast of poetry.

345
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:26,360
Shall we go home?

346
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:26,920
Sure.

347
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:28,240
Let's go.

348
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:28,880
That's it?

349
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:29,720
Mr. Du, let's go home.

350
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:30,520
Take care of her.

351
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:31,200
Sure.

352
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:31,680
All right?

353
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:32,240
What a night.

354
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,360
Indeed.

355
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:35,200
Am I good?

356
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:38,440
Honey, do you know Dylan Thomas?

357
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,600
I will know someday.

358
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,400
Honey,

359
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:45,960
do you know Dylan Thomas?

360
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,320
Dylan Thomas!

361
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,560
You've been saying it all the way.

362
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:50,280
Come on.

363
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,480
You know,

364
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:57,320
he was an alcoholic.

365
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:00,600
He drank himself to death when he hadn't yet turned 40.

366
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,160
Such a shame.

367
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,160
If you keep drinking like this,

368
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,080
you'll end up like him

369
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,360
before you turn 40.

370
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,880
Honey, I want to throw up.

371
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:13,640
Honey,

372
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:15,280
Mr. Ma said…

373
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,400
He said…

374
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:21,080
What?

375
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,520
He said that he would buy my next book.

376
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,360
Great.

377
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:32,600
I should have hugged him before we left.

378
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:39,600
That's all right.

379
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,080
Just hug the toilet as if it was him.

380
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:41,840
As long as you have something to hug.

381
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,200
Dad,

382
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:44,960
what's wrong with my mom?

383
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,200
She's seeking inspiration.

384
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,760
Go back to bed.

385
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:50,480
Just go.

386
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:53,400
You're so noisy.

387
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:54,680
Hurry up.

388
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:01,840
Well,

389
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,280
your son saw you like this.

390
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:06,480
Would you like some?

391
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:08,400
No, thanks.

392
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:09,800
Drink all you want.

393
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:11,920
Bottoms up.

394
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,360
Are you serious?

395
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:19,120
I don't feel well.

396
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,520
All right. Relax.

397
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,080
Mom.

398
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,600
I'm thirsty.

399
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:30,960
I know.

400
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:35,160
But the doctor said you can't drink yet.

401
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,680
Just hang in there,

402
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:37,880
all right?

403
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:53,320
Liangzhou.

404
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:56,720
Just go home and get some sleep.

405
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:57,520
I'll stay.

406
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,800
You gave so much blood today.

407
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:01,720
I'm OK.

408
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:02,920
I want to stay here for her.

409
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:08,840
Can you do me a favor?

410
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:11,840
Sure.

411
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,200
This is the key to Peng Pai's apartment.

412
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:18,400
Tomorrow, go to his place

413
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:20,800
and pack all of my sister's stuff

414
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,160
to your place for the moment. All right?

415
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:24,840
OK.

416
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,120
I'll go with you.

417
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:28,120
Uncle.

418
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,520
You don't need to.

419
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:31,920
He can do it on his own.

420
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:32,720
That's right.

421
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:35,000
Also, I booked a hotel room nearby.

422
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:37,200
Why don't you and Aunt have a rest there?

423
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:38,680
I'm not tired.

424
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:40,880
I'll go with you tomorrow.

425
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:46,560
Have you told Granny yet?

426
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:47,880
No.

427
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,400
I'm afraid she would come right away

428
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:51,680
if she knew.

429
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,400
So I didn't tell her.

430
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:55,920
I agree. Don't tell her now.

431
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,920
Let's wait until Xiaoyu is discharged.

432
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:00,400
I agree.

433
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:24,640
Hello?

434
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,360
Why are you calling so early?

435
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,360
Why didn't you tell me?

436
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,640
Where are you now?

437
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:37,520
Ms. You.

438
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:38,880
Is everyone here?

439
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:39,720
Yes.

440
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:41,760
Mr. Cheng asked when you would arrive.

441
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:42,880
Tell him I'm here.

442
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:43,720
I'll join you in a minute.

443
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:44,240
OK.

444
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:48,480
Bao Xue.

445
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:49,080
Shanshan.

446
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:50,520
My sister had an accident.

447
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:53,080
How is she?

448
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,440
She's already out of danger.

449
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:56,920
When did this happen?

450
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,400
Yesterday afternoon.

451
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:00,680
Why did you wait till now to tell me?

452
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:02,240
I hadn't got a chance to.

453
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,319
Which hospital is she in?

454
00:17:05,319 --> 00:17:06,319
Chaoyang Hospital.

455
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:07,760
I'll be there.

456
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,280
Everyone's ready.

457
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:10,040
We're waiting for you.

458
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,079
I have something urgent to deal with.

459
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:13,200
Let's have the meeting in the afternoon.

460
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:13,839
OK.

461
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:43,320
Du Shijun.

462
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,520
Du Shijun!

463
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:46,920
Your mother is awake.

464
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:53,520
You're awake, Goddess of Wine.

465
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:56,000
Was I drunk last night?

466
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,000
Almost.

467
00:17:58,480 --> 00:17:59,680
You were almost in heaven.

468
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,640
I still feel sick.

469
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:04,800
Get up already.

470
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:05,760
I made wonton soup.

471
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,080
You'll feel better in your stomach

472
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:08,240
after you have some soup.

473
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:11,640
Come here.

474
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,080
Sit.

475
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,960
I know it's been hard for you.

476
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:25,880
What?

477
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:30,080
I really understand you now.

478
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,920
You had to drink at business dinners.

479
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,040
Even though you felt sick in the morning,

480
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:37,120
you had to get up and go to work.

481
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:39,200
It was tough.

482
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,680
I only got drunk once

483
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:43,680
and I feel like hell the next morning.

484
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:45,480
I

485
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:46,880
don't feel comfortable

486
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:49,640
in my stomach.

487
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:50,960
Well,

488
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:52,320
you should take it easy.

489
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:55,120
Dylan Thomas

490
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,040
drank himself to death before he was 40.

491
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:00,920
You know Dylan Thomas?

492
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,680
I'm so impressed.

493
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,120
You don't remember anything, do you?

494
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:08,360
I told you that when I was drunk, right?

495
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:10,960
I need a hug.

496
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:16,480
I appreciate it, my darling.

497
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:26,840
You're here.

498
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:27,680
Do you want to go inside?

499
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:28,400
Shanshan.

500
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,520
Close the door.

501
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,360
My sister is awake. Don't you want to see her?

502
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:33,600
I'll go inside later.

503
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:34,640
I can't bear to see her like that.

504
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:36,120
I'll come again

505
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:37,200
when she gets better.

506
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:39,480
The doctor said

507
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:41,000
that she's out of danger now.

508
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:41,880
Don't worry.

509
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,080
What are you doing here?

510
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,600
Didn't I tell you not to come again?

511
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:58,000
I came to see Xiaoyu.

512
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,240
She's like this because of me.

513
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,320
I'll take my responsibility.

514
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:01,240
No need.

515
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:03,680
You don't understand human language, do you?

516
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:05,160
Then let me say it again.

517
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,520
It's over between you and my sister.

518
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:09,440
Even so, I need to hear Xiaoyu say it.

519
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:12,920
Xue.

520
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,200
You want to see her?

521
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:14,640
Listen.

522
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,200
I won't let you get near her.

523
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,360
What are you doing?

524
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:42,120
Why did you even greet him?

525
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:44,360
What did I do?

526
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:45,320
I was just being polite.

527
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:46,200
Being polite?

528
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:48,040
Do you need to be polite with him?

529
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:49,040
Why didn't I know

530
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,120
that you're such a gentleman?

531
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:51,720
Enough.

532
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:54,920
It's so stupid of you

533
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,200
arguing over him.

534
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:01,120
Do you need anything else?

535
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:05,080
Don't worry.

536
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:06,920
Have you got enough cash?

537
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:07,840
Yes.

538
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:10,360
Let me know if anything.

539
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:14,000
Call me if that bastard comes again.

540
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:18,920
All right. Calm down.

541
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:21,520
Drive me to the set.

542
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,200
I'll come back when I finish today's shooting.

543
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,920
OK. I'll be there with you. Let's go.

544
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:26,520
Just calm down.

545
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:31,160
Please wait a minute.

546
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:32,440
I'll go and grab the menu.

547
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:37,640
My only regret

548
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:39,600
is that I don't know who Mr. Lu's brother-in-law is.

549
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,720
If I knew,

550
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:42,680
I would beat him up.

551
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:43,960
Excuse me, Sir.

552
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:46,320
No smoking is allowed here.

553
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:47,440
Let me finish this one.

554
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:49,280
What about you smoke outside?

555
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:50,000
I'm sorry.

556
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
But we have rules here.

557
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,880
Every restaurant has its rules,

558
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:53,480
right?

559
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:55,720
But the rules are made by people.

560
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,720
We have other guests here.

561
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:58,720
Sorry to bother you.

562
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,000
But could you please put that out?

563
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:10,200
Are you satisfied?

564
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:12,200
Where's the restroom?

565
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:14,920
Down the hall.

566
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:16,560
Thank you.

567
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:18,680
Excuse me for a minute.

568
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,200
I need to go to the restroom.

569
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:31,200
Someone's in here.

570
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:36,080
Excuse me.

571
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:37,200
Do you have another restroom?

572
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:38,280
Go further inside.

573
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:39,480
Go past the VIP rooms and you'll see.

574
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:40,280
Thanks.

575
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:24,000
Have you got all of Xiaoyu's stuff?

576
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:25,640
I've checked everywhere.

577
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:26,760
I think I have everything.

578
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:30,680
Let's go.

579
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,120
Excuse me.

580
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:49,720
You…

581
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:50,960
What are you doing?

582
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:54,080
We've packed Xiaoyu's stuff.

583
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:54,800
You can pack her things

584
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,360
but only with my permission.

585
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,080
Sir,

586
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:11,680
I know you're mad at me.

587
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:13,640
But I didn't mean to hurt Xiaoyu.

588
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:14,160
Actually…

589
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:15,360
Don't say her name.

590
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:20,000
Kid,

591
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,800
don't you ever come near her!

592
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:25,960
Or,

593
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:28,000
I'll come after you with everything I have.

594
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,520
Uncle,

595
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:30,440
calm down.

596
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:35,600
Let's go.

597
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:43,800
I don't want to see you again.

598
00:24:58,760 --> 00:24:59,680
Uncle,

599
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:02,240
you scared me a bit just now.

600
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:03,240
You were awesome.

601
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:06,320
I was being nice to him.

602
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:07,360
If he dares to push it further,

603
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:08,680
I'll definitely kill him.

604
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:11,800
Xiaoyu almost lost her life

605
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:13,360
because of him.

606
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:14,920
It is said that a father

607
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:16,560
would do anything for his daughter.

608
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:18,440
Now I see.

609
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:19,160
Of course.

610
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:20,960
You're too young to understand it.

611
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:23,280
You'll feel it when you have children.

612
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,560
I don't like kids.

613
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:40,560
Where are we going?

614
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:44,240
Bao Xue asked me to put Xiaoyu's stuff at my place.

615
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,200
No.

616
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:46,880
Listen.

617
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,440
Drive me to a real estate agency.

618
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,080
I need to rent an apartment.

619
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:52,200
When Xiaoyu is discharged, she'll have her own place.

620
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,440
She can live with Bao Xue.

621
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:56,000
She can't live there forever.

622
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,640
Once we have found a place,

623
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:58,840
we'll move her stuff there.

624
00:25:58,920 --> 00:25:59,720
If we drop it at your place now,

625
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:01,400
we'll have to move it over again.

626
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:03,640
OK.

627
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,960
How old are you?

628
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:08,600
That's something interesting.

629
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:11,680
I was born on the same day as Xiaoyu.

630
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:12,680
And we have the same blood type.

631
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:14,760
What a coincidence!

632
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,160
What do you do?

633
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:18,320
I'm a photographer.

634
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:19,680
Photographer?

635
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:21,200
Do you shoot films?

636
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:21,960
Everything.

637
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:23,680
Everything?

638
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:26,240
Well.

639
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:30,400
I assume you don't have a steady income.

640
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,080
I don't earn as much as those rich men.

641
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:33,360
But my life is quite free.

642
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:35,640
You should

643
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:37,440
work hard towards your goal

644
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,000
while you're still young.

645
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:42,560
I was too tough

646
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:44,480
on Xiaoyu before.

647
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:47,560
But it didn't do her any good.

648
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:49,680
Do your parents support you

649
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:50,880
in doing what you love?

650
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:51,880
Actually, yes.

651
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:05,320
How did it go?

652
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:06,960
Take a look yourself.

653
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:11,560
20,000!

654
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:16,480
It must be that drunk.

655
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:17,960
I didn't let him smoke.

656
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:20,120
So he complained that people in the VIP rooms smoked.

657
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:22,760
He even took a picture.

658
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:25,880
It's so hard running a restaurant.

659
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:28,960
Even if you adhere to every single rule,

660
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:30,720
you can't prevent anyone
from complaining to the authority.

661
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,720
This is the first time we got complained.

662
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:35,000
We usually don't allow anyone to smoke here.

663
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:37,280
But they were Ms. You's friends in the VIP room.

664
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:39,360
So I could only pretend I didn't see it.

665
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:40,920
Rules are rules.

666
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:42,880
No matter whose friends come,

667
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,440
no one is allowed to smoke.

668
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:48,120
You didn't tell Shanshan, did you?

669
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:48,920
No.

670
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:50,680
You told me not to.

671
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:51,120
Right.

672
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:52,120
Don't tell her.

673
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,440
I was here to help her.

674
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:55,760
But instead of easing her burden,

675
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:56,440
I incurred a fine of 20,000 yuan.

676
00:27:58,120 --> 00:27:59,160
I feel so embarrassed.

677
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:02,320
But you shouldn't pay for it.

678
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:03,640
Of course, I should.

679
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:05,400
This was my fault.

680
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:07,960
If I was nicer to him,

681
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:08,840
all this wouldn't have happened.

682
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:10,440
It's not like that.

683
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:13,920
Ms. Si,

684
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:15,840
how is Xiaoyu?

685
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,000
She had an operation.

686
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,440
She's safe now.

687
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:21,600
But she needs to stay in hospital for a while.

688
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:25,080
Shanshan also asked me to remind you.

689
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:26,600
Do not tell Feng Xi

690
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:27,760
about Xiaoyu.

691
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:30,440
Wait until she's dealt with her own matters.

692
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:33,080
Have you got it?

693
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:35,600
Don't tell Shanshan about the fine.

694
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:38,360
And don't tell Feng Xi about Xiaoyu.

695
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:39,280
Mm.

696
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:40,440
I got it. Don't worry.

697
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:43,360
I'll pay the fine later.

698
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:48,960
Finally, they're leaving tomorrow.

699
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:50,360
Keep it down.

700
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:51,760
When it's all finished,

701
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:54,000
I must thank you.

702
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:57,400
Then let me think carefully about how you can thank me.

703
00:28:58,280 --> 00:28:58,920
Sure.

704
00:28:58,920 --> 00:28:59,720
No problem.

705
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:00,880
Mom.

706
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:02,320
When is your train tomorrow?

707
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,480
It's 10 o'clock in the morning.

708
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:05,600
Don't worry.

709
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:06,960
We'll call a taxi.

710
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:08,120
No, Auntie.

711
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:09,480
We'll take you to the station.

712
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:10,440
There's no need.

713
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:11,120
All right, Mom.

714
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:12,200
That's the plan.

715
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:13,640
Fine.

716
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:17,040
You first, Feng Xi.

717
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:21,960
We're leaving tomorrow.

718
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:22,840
Son,

719
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:25,480
let me teach you two new courses.

720
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:26,200
All right.

721
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,280
I'd love to learn more from you.

722
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:45,080
Don't be mad, Mom.

723
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:47,120
Let me explain.

724
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:47,560
Dad.

725
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:48,840
Help me talk to my mother.

726
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:54,680
Careful, Mom.

727
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:58,440
Dad.

728
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:08,640
Feng Xi.

729
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:13,840
You can yell at me if you want.

730
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:17,160
I know you are upset.

731
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:19,400
I don't want to yell at you.

732
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:21,480
I have nothing to say.

733
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:25,920
Do you have anything to say?

734
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:28,360
If not, can you leave?

735
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:31,280
Please.

736
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,360
Don't treat me like that.

737
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:34,320
It's not what you think.

738
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:36,320
Feng Xi,

739
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:41,480
I will never leave you again from now on.

740
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:42,280
I won't leave again.

741
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:45,760
Let's…

742
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:48,360
Let's get back together.

743
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,480
Are you serious?

744
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:55,440
Do you think no one will ever love me?

745
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:15,920
All right.

746
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:17,480
It's too late. Go back to your place.

747
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:19,960
We'll leave on our own tomorrow.

748
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:20,800
Please.

749
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:22,120
I'll see you off.

750
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:22,880
No, thanks.

751
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:24,760
Zhao Henan.

752
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:26,440
You've really grown up, haven't you?

753
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:28,720
You even dared to lie to us.

754
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:29,640
To be honest,

755
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:31,760
the first time I went to Feng Xi's place,

756
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:33,120
I felt something was not right.

757
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:34,200
All right. All right.

758
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:35,880
Don't act like you knew everything all along.

759
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:37,240
You don't believe me?

760
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:38,920
Let me ask you.

761
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:40,720
As soon as I stepped into her apartment,

762
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:42,760
the men's slippers at the door

763
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:44,480
were brand new.

764
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:45,720
Didn't you notice that?

765
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:46,440
Also,

766
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:47,640
the personal care products for men

767
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:49,560
in the bathroom were brand new.

768
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:51,000
Was that just a coincidence?

769
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:52,880
You used everything up right before we came?

770
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:54,120
Plus,

771
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:54,960
if they had been together

772
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:56,480
for so long,

773
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:58,840
why didn't I see any picture of them together?

774
00:31:58,840 --> 00:31:59,880
Is that normal?

775
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,560
Why didn't you say it back then?

776
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:02,920
I didn't say it

777
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:06,040
because I couldn't believe he would lie to us.

778
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:11,840
Henan.

779
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:14,560
I had been doing political work all my life.

780
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:16,600
It only takes me a second
to see through anyone or anything.

781
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:19,120
Why didn't I reveal the truth?

782
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:22,120
Because I would rather believe it was a coincidence.

783
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:23,880
I didn't expect that you would actually lie to us.

784
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:24,880
How dare you!

785
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:26,560
Do you think we are both idiots?

786
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:31,520
Henan.

787
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:33,000
Apologize to your mother.

788
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:43,960
Don't lie to us ever again.

789
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:45,960
We are family.

790
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:47,480
We should be honest with each other, all right?

791
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:50,200
I just don't want Mom

792
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:51,240
to keep introducing me to some girls.

793
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:52,880
So I asked Feng Xi

794
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:54,240
to pretend to be my girlfriend.

795
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:55,480
I didn't mean bad.

796
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:57,480
I thought if we got through
the last couple of days, everything would be fine.

797
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:58,720
I didn't expect

798
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,200
that her ex-boyfriend would appear suddenly.

799
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:00,880
Right.

800
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,000
As you said,

801
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:04,160
it's her ex-boyfriend.

802
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:06,040
If they already broke up,

803
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:07,880
Feng Xi is single now.

804
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,600
Any man can pursue her.

805
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,040
Why did he

806
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:12,640
act like he was entitled to be there

807
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,840
while you ran away as if you did something wrong?

808
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:15,960
Henan.

809
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:17,240
You are a man.

810
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:19,440
You did nothing wrong. What are you afraid of?

811
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:20,440
I'm not afraid of him.

812
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:21,480
I didn't want to embarrass you two.

813
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:22,400
Why would I be embarrassed?

814
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:24,280
Whoever ran away was the one embarrassed.

815
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:25,800
All right.

816
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:27,040
That's enough.

817
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:36,000
Mom,

818
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,120
do you like Feng Xi?

819
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:38,520
Why?

820
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:40,880
Why does it matter if I like her or not?

821
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:41,840
Anyway, I like her.

822
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:43,360
Where are you going?

823
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:47,480
Mom is right.

824
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:48,880
Whoever ran away was the one embarrassed.

825
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:50,200
Let him go.

826
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,240
Wait…

827
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:54,960
Don't stop him.

828
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:00,240
Have some water.

829
00:34:09,159 --> 00:34:10,280
Feng Xi,

830
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:12,199
I've been missing you a lot.

831
00:34:13,719 --> 00:34:14,800
Really.

832
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:16,560
Really?

833
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,480
You broke up with me

834
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:22,840
and haven't said a word for so long.

835
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:25,199
I didn't know it's because you're busy missing me.

836
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,400
You must be mad at me still.

837
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:30,199
I know.

838
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:33,920
I broke your heart.

839
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:36,880
I didn't get in touch

840
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:38,880
because I feel ashamed of myself.

841
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:42,280
I admit

842
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:45,400
that in the past few months,

843
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,760
I got too occupied with my research,

844
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,639
so much so

845
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:53,120
that I felt any relationship

846
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:56,320
would be a burden for me

847
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:57,440
and would drag me behind.

848
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:01,880
I was so stupid.

849
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:03,920
But now

850
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:06,560
I don't think so anymore.

851
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:13,080
You were right.

852
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:16,720
We were together for ten years.

853
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:20,880
It's not something

854
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:23,000
you can just let go.

855
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:26,200
But I already let it go.

856
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:28,680
But you can pick it up.

857
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:29,840
It won't be a problem.

858
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:36,680
Sorry.

859
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:37,920
I know

860
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:40,640
I have no right to talk to you like this.

861
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,520
You know what,

862
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:51,960
each time I saw my colleagues

863
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:54,080
who have their careers

864
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:55,840
as well as their happy family lives,

865
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:59,920
I suddenly felt so lonely.

866
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:02,960
But whenever I felt that way,

867
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:06,480
I don't know why

868
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:10,240
but I just missed you so much.

869
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:12,720
Feng Xi.

870
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,480
I beg you.

871
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:19,320
Could you give me another chance?

872
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:21,360
I know I made a mistake.

873
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:22,560
I was so naive.

874
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:24,960
I was so selfish.

875
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:27,760
I did everything wrong.

876
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:30,520
Please, will you give me another chance?

877
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:31,400
As long as you forgive me,

878
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:32,600
I'll do anything to love you.

879
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:33,480
I swear.

880
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:34,920
Another chance?

881
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:37,160
I gave you ten years

882
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:38,880
and you just threw it away in five minutes.

883
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:47,920
Right after you broke up with me,

884
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,160
you must know how upset I was.

885
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:52,680
But have you ever asked how I was?

886
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:56,160
At least you may have asked as a friend.

887
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:57,200
Have you?

888
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:01,440
I'm just afraid…

889
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:02,440
Right. You're afraid of everything.

890
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:05,160
But have you ever considered my feelings?

891
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:10,200
Please.

892
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:11,600
Just give me one more chance.

893
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:13,400
If I do it ever again,

894
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:15,520
I won't bring that up ever.

895
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:16,360
I'll disappear from your life.

896
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:18,160
What kind of chance are you asking for?

897
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:21,360
Should I wait for you to marry me
after you get your degree abroad?

898
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:21,960
Yes.

899
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:23,880
I'll marry you.

900
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:25,840
But you don't need to wait any longer.

901
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:27,240
I came back this time

902
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:29,920
just to marry you and get all formalities done.

903
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:32,560
Then I'll bring you and my parents to Germany.

904
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:34,640
This is my plan.

905
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:36,360
You know, they are old now.

906
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:40,840
I see.

907
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:47,200
I thought you suddenly had a conscience.

908
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:52,600
So you're worried that as your parents get older,

909
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:53,880
there needs to be someone to take care of them.

910
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:56,120
So you should marry me

911
00:37:58,280 --> 00:37:59,960
so that I can take care of your family

912
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:01,440
and you don't need to pay for a nanny.

913
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:02,640
Why do you think like that?

914
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:07,040
I'll marry you because I love you.

915
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:08,600
They are not the same thing.

916
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:19,000
Send a text to your son.

917
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:21,280
No, I won't.

918
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:22,840
Let him deal with it himself.

919
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:25,480
A man should be brave enough

920
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:28,000
to fight for things he wants.

921
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:29,720
That is my son.

922
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:33,080
You're enjoying this, aren't you?

923
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:34,680
They are still young.

924
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:36,120
What if they start a fight?

925
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:38,200
When will you ever know

926
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:39,800
how to observe a situation?

927
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:42,080
I had been doing political work all my life.

928
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:44,240
It only takes me a second
to see through anyone or anything.

929
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:45,240
Tell you what,

930
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:47,280
if Henan goes back now,

931
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:49,200
there won't be any fight at all.

932
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:51,280
Instead, he and Feng Xi may become a real couple.

933
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:52,720
Do you believe it?

934
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:56,600
Don't act like you're a prophet.

935
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:58,720
Let's wait and see.

936
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:00,520
I already have a boyfriend.

937
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:01,560
We love each other.

938
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:02,600
Feng Xi,

939
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,520
don't fool yourself.

940
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:06,720
I know

941
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:08,680
you're still in love with me.

942
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:11,080
Do you really think

943
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:12,840
that cook loves you?

944
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:14,120
If he loved you,

945
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:15,840
why would he run away immediately?

946
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:18,560
Open the door.
