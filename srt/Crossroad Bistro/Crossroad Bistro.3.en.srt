4
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:19,640
Wake up, you cheap drunk.

5
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,520
Didn't you say

6
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,079
that you can drink no more than one bottle?

7
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:30,680
I can drink anyone under the table.

8
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:33,000
You must be thinking that I'm a legend.

9
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:36,560
Don't you feel lucky to have met me?

10
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:39,040
I always feel lucky that I've met you.

11
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,480
Are you recording?

12
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,079
Hello?

13
00:03:27,079 --> 00:03:27,560
Hello.

14
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,560
May I speak to Shen Peihong?

15
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,680
This is she.

16
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,000
Who is it?

17
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:32,960
I'm Peng Pai,

18
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,360
Xiaoyu's boyfriend.

19
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:36,079
I'm not sure if you remember me.

20
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,760
Yeah, I remember.

21
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:42,760
I'm calling to ask

22
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:44,600
if you've seen Xiaoyu recently.

23
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:47,200
I helped her to choose a wedding dress last month.

24
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,840
Have you two met since then?

25
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:51,320
I remember we met a few days ago.

26
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:52,120
Right.

27
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,760
She came to see me a few days ago.

28
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:56,200
Xiaoyu.

29
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,000
You began to cry as soon as you came.

30
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,320
You haven't said a word.

31
00:03:58,760 --> 00:03:59,200
What's wrong?

32
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,720
Can you just tell me?

33
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:06,040
I don't even know how to say it.

34
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,640
You two had a fight?

35
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:13,120
Xiaoyu.

36
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,560
What happened?

37
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,040
Don't ask.

38
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:23,280
She just kept crying.

39
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,160
She wouldn't tell me anything.

40
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,760
I thought maybe you two had a fight.

41
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,760
It's just

42
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:30,680
we had some squabbles.

43
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,480
She was so headstrong that she just left.

44
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:35,960
I checked her ticket

45
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:37,080
and I knew she went back to China.

46
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,600
But she changed her number

47
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,200
and unfriended me

48
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:40,920
on all social media

49
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,159
and WeChat.

50
00:04:42,159 --> 00:04:42,760
I

51
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:44,040
can't find her.

52
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,080
Do you know any other way to contact her?

53
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,760
She went back to China?

54
00:04:49,159 --> 00:04:51,280
Is it as bad as that?

55
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,400
What on earth happened between you two?

56
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,640
But she didn't even tell me.

57
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:55,840
What can I do?

58
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:57,880
It's really nothing serious.

59
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,400
Could you do me a favor

60
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,240
and try

61
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,800
to find out where she is?

62
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,400
Listen,

63
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:06,000
I'll keep an eye out for you.

64
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,600
I'll call you as soon as I get in touch with her.

65
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,200
Alright?

66
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:08,720
Of course.

67
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:09,920
Thank you so much.

68
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:10,840
Keep in touch.

69
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,280
See you.

70
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,240
One part of our business

71
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,520
is to bridge the cooperation

72
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:41,120
between commercial clients and movies and TV series;

73
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,640
that is, product placement

74
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:44,880
in movies and TV series for our clients.

75
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:46,880
Mostly, we deal with

76
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:49,640
the marketing team of the client,

77
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,680
or the producer of a film or a TV series.

78
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,200
Most of our deals

79
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,640
are closed over a dinner table.

80
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:57,159
So, I join your company

81
00:05:57,159 --> 00:05:58,640
to have dinners with clients, right?

82
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:01,280
It takes a high EQ

83
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,480
to know when to heat up the conversation,

84
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,480
how to manage the tempo of the conversation,

85
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:06,120
what to talk about,

86
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,720
and what should not be talked about.

87
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:09,440
Do you understand?

88
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,720
It seems that

89
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,000
that's a lot of responsibility.

90
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,880
I'm not sure I'm competent.

91
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,240
Give it a try,

92
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:16,960
OK?

93
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,320
Let's just

94
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:19,800
give it three months.

95
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,080
During this time,

96
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,560
we'll try working with each other.

97
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,600
Right now, it looks like you're doing me a favor.

98
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,560
But in the long run,

99
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,560
as you gain more experience,

100
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,880
don't you think you're also

101
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,000
expanding your connections?

102
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,240
Come in.

103
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:33,159
Mr. Chai,

104
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:34,360
Ms. Dai's onboarding formalities

105
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,280
are done.

106
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,200
Let her take a look.

107
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:37,920
Ms. Dai,

108
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,120
this is the contract you signed.

109
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,040
Here's your copy.

110
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:40,800
Your monthly salary

111
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:41,880
will reach your bank account

112
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,680
on the 15th of each month.

113
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,400
Your social securities
will take effect from next month.

114
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,760
Do you have any questions?

115
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,440
No, thanks.

116
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,240
Bring two bottles

117
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,240
of Fusi water, please.

118
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,560
I need to brew the tea.

119
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,000
Of course.

120
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,400
As we agreed,

121
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:58,960
for each deal

122
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,400
that is closed,

123
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,920
as long as you have participated in it

124
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:04,080
and played an important role,

125
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:05,800
you'll be rewarded.

126
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:06,880
Here.

127
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,560
With this tea,

128
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,520
I sincerely welcome you,

129
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:11,760
Ms. Dai Xiaoyu,

130
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:13,480
to join our company.

131
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:14,960
Thanks, Mr. Chai.

132
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:19,880
The tea is really good.

133
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,200
Good tea elevates good water.

134
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,760
Good water makes good tea.

135
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:24,400
Both are indispensable.

136
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:26,560
I've made an appointment for you with Ms. Hua.

137
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,920
She's in Beijing only for today.

138
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,840
See you at the club at 6 PM.

139
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,080
Great, Mr. Kong.

140
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,480
I'll definitely be there

141
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,240
at 6 PM tonight.

142
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,200
Come together with me tonight.

143
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,680
We're going to meet Ms. Hua.

144
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,960
She's the boss

145
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,880
of the largest talent agency in China.

146
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:43,960
Do your homework,

147
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:44,600
OK?

148
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,440
Oh, Chun Lei is a talent of her company.

149
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,920
Do you know Chun Lei?

150
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:48,840
Of course.

151
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:49,680
He's a real man.

152
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:50,680
He works at her company.

153
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:53,320
It's so hard to make an appointment with Ms. Hua.

154
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:56,040
It's only for the sake of Mr. Kong, CEO of New Dream,

155
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,040
that she agreed to meet me.

156
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,600
So, tonight,

157
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,080
we need to cooperate with each other.

158
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:00,720
I

159
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,440
will make Ms. Hua happy

160
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,960
and you make sure Mr. Kong is happy.

161
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:04,320
OK?

162
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:06,120
Don't let Mr. Kong feel bored.

163
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:06,720
OK.

164
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,840
Do you know Mr. Kong?

165
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:10,440
Mr. Kong?

166
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,800
I saw him on TV.

167
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,600
But he looks like a typical science geek.

168
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,160
I'm not sure if he can drink much.

169
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,840
That's why you need to talk to him.

170
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,960
You can talk about the latest TV series of New Dream.

171
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,520
Talk about the most popular ones.

172
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:22,000
Compliment him.

173
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,640
Tell him how talented he is.

174
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,160
Mr. Chai.

175
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,920
I'd like to make something clear first.

176
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:30,720
Go ahead.

177
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:33,520
You may give me guidance in terms of work.

178
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:34,640
If I do something wrong,

179
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,440
you can certainly criticize me.

180
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:38,480
But I'm not a frivolous girl.

181
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,799
That's my bottom line.

182
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,919
Then I'll criticize you right now.

183
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:44,800
Dai Xiaoyu,

184
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,560
how could you

185
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,800
think so negatively

186
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,040
of what we do here?

187
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,560
Mr. Chai, you're funny.

188
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:20,200
Good afternoon, ma'am.

189
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:21,840
Everyone,

190
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:22,760
you can get off now.

191
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:23,440
We arrived.

192
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,480
Mom!

193
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,440
Zhuang.

194
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,440
Mom,

195
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,640
we're asked to pay for the snacks tomorrow.

196
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:29,560
Say goodbye to your teacher.

197
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:30,320
Bye-bye.

198
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:32,720
We need to pay for the snacks.

199
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:33,400
I know.

200
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,760
The teacher already told us in the chat group.

201
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:36,080
Please remember to pay.

202
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,520
I already paid.

203
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:47,800
Yuan.

204
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,080
I'm here.

205
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,760
Mom!

206
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:51,840
You want me to carry you?

207
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,040
Zhuang, please take this for me.

208
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:53,760
Carry me.

209
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,280
Mom.

210
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:59,080
Say goodbye to your teacher.

211
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:00,400
Bye-bye.

212
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,160
Come on, Zhuang.

213
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,160
Mom.

214
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:04,960
What did you do today?

215
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:07,240
Today in kindergarten,

216
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,400
the teacher asked us

217
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,400
to talk about our mothers.

218
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,120
What did you say?

219
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,480
I said that

220
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,480
my mom is the prettiest.

221
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:17,200
How sweet of you!

222
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,240
And what else?

223
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,320
The teacher also asked us

224
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,080
to talk about our mothers' jobs.

225
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,200
So, what did you say?

226
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,720
I said my mom bathes people.

227
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,280
That's not true.

228
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:30,000
Except for you and your brother,

229
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,360
who else did I bathe?

230
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,680
I remember you also bathed Dad.

231
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,080
Nonsense.

232
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:36,680
Your father is an adult and he can do it himself.

233
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:40,880
Mom.

234
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:41,680
What's up?

235
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:44,560
Can we have a puppy?

236
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,000
No.

237
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:47,760
Why?

238
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,680
I'm busy enough raising you two.

239
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:52,040
I don't have time to walk the dog.

240
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:54,920
Mom, that's OK.

241
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:56,600
I can help you.

242
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:57,800
It's not my idea to have a puppy.

243
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:58,800
What do you help me with?

244
00:10:58,800 --> 00:10:59,960
Go and do your homework.

245
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,880
I think Dad can walk the dog.

246
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,400
That's right.

247
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,120
Then you can't blame him anymore

248
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,000
for not doing anything.

249
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,920
Do you think I have a reason to blame him?

250
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,200
I'm only seven.

251
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:14,920
Don't ask me

252
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:17,320
questions that you adults can't even answer.

253
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,240
Naughty.

254
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,720
Where did you learn that?

255
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,200
Internet.

256
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,240
I think

257
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,760
Mom is right.

258
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:26,560
Go and wash your hands.

259
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,520
Dinner will be ready soon.

260
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:32,280
Have more vegetables.

261
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:34,920
Take your time.

262
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:39,600
Mom, I think I'm full.

263
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,840
Then don't force yourself.

264
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:41,920
Just finish your soup, OK?

265
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:42,680
OK.

266
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:44,400
Mom.

267
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,880
When will Dad come home?

268
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:48,240
He promised to play games with me.

269
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,960
He was invited to dinner this evening.

270
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:52,160
So you'll play by yourself.

271
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,280
He often breaks his word.

272
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:59,960
It seems that I have to fight the enemies on my own.

273
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,080
You can only play one round today

274
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,640
before you go to bed.

275
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,520
Put the bones on the paper.

276
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:15,640
Ms. Hua.

277
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:16,600
Sorry,

278
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,520
I don't drink.

279
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:23,760
Mr. Kong.

280
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:24,800
Mr. Chai.

281
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,680
Ms. Hua.

282
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:27,880
Both of you

283
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:29,400
had great partnerships with New Dream.

284
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:32,240
Today I'm here to introduce you to each other

285
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,920
as Mr. Chai has a favor to ask of Ms. Hua.

286
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,160
I have another dinner to go to.

287
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,200
So I'll leave you alone.

288
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,640
Excuse me.

289
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:39,280
I really appreciate it.

290
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:41,000
Thank you so much, Mr. Kong.

291
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,160
I'm so honored to have dinner

292
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:43,920
with Ms. Hua,

293
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:44,960
thanks to Mr. Kong.

294
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:45,640
Sorry,

295
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:46,240
I've got to get going.

296
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,160
Of course.

297
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,440
Excuse me.

298
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,000
No problem.

299
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:50,320
We're good here.

300
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,280
All right. See you.

301
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:51,880
See you.

302
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:04,560
Mr. Chai.

303
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:05,920
Go ahead.

304
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:06,760
What do you need?

305
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:07,680
Ms. Hua, see,

306
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,720
Guan Xiong's company, Xin Li Liang,

307
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:10,720
is producing a TV series.

308
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:11,240
Right.

309
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:14,240
My company is in charge

310
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,680
of the product placement of this series.

311
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,400
Yesterday, the producer called

312
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:20,640
and told me that the contract was almost finalized.

313
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:22,880
But suddenly, Chun Lei quit.

314
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,680
We don't know what happened.

315
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,400
Do you think

316
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:27,440
you could do me a favor

317
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,360
and ask him back, Ms. Hua?

318
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:29,960
Is that possible?

319
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:30,720
With this cup of wine,

320
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:31,120
you...

321
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,360
I'll drink it bottom-up.

322
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:33,640
It's my honor.

323
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:34,640
Thanks, Ms. Hua.

324
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,080
Mr. Chai.

325
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:39,720
I can't help you with this one.

326
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:43,320
Previously,

327
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:45,760
when I talked to the producer,

328
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:48,160
they made it clear

329
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,920
that Yishan is the leading actor

330
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,440
and Chun Lei plays the supporting role.

331
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:52,600
Chun Lei

332
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,440
likes this role

333
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:55,400
and therefore agreed.

334
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:57,760
But yesterday,

335
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,520
we heard

336
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:02,400
that Peng will play the leading role.

337
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:05,720
He's so young.

338
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:08,080
And they asked Chun Lei to be his supporting role?

339
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:11,160
I don't think this makes sense in every way.

340
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,880
Ms. Hua, I totally get it.

341
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,760
But there's one thing.

342
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:20,840
We've made it clear

343
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:21,960
from the very beginning

344
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,560
that the leading actor is a young man.

345
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:26,800
But not all young actors are the same.

346
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,080
If the leading actor is,

347
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:28,680
say,

348
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:29,800
Qianxi,

349
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:30,800
Haoran,

350
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:31,560
or Huang Xuan,

351
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:32,840
then there's no problem at all.

352
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,440
Because each one of them has got something.

353
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:36,840
What does Peng have?

354
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:38,960
He only became famous for the Brothers

355
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:40,000
who Overcome All Obstacles.

356
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,480
That is a reality show,

357
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:43,040
not a piece of art.

358
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,760
Chun Lei played
in so many popular series over the years.

359
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,080
And now you ask him to play a supporting role for Peng?

360
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:49,240
Once people know this,

361
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:51,800
how do we get proper roles for him anymore?

362
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,000
You can ask around yourself.

363
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,160
Any producer who wants Chun Lei

364
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:56,760
would give him the leading role.

365
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,400
Ms. Hua, please allow me to be frank.

366
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,440
Sure.

367
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,400
Is it possible

368
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:03,960
that

369
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:05,600
the problem

370
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,560
lies in the money?

371
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,200
What about this?

372
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:08,960
For Chun Lei,

373
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:11,040
apart from the remuneration from the crew,

374
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,440
our client will pay him separately.

375
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,560
It's not about money.

376
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,800
Look, Ms. Hua.

377
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:19,720
We are both agents.

378
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:21,040
You

379
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:22,680
speak on behalf of your talents.

380
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:23,640
Me?

381
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:25,040
I embed ads

382
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,120
for my clients.

383
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:27,200
But the main difference between us is

384
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,360
that you can make the call

385
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:30,040
regarding the business of your talents.

386
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:30,880
But in relation to my clients' businesses,

387
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:33,160
my words don't count.

388
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:34,760
Now they believe

389
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:35,520
that Chun Lei

390
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:37,440
is a perfect match

391
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,640
with their brand's character.

392
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:40,320
I have a thought.

393
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,160
I'll invite you

394
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:42,360
and everyone else to dinner.

395
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:44,320
And you can bring Chun Lei here.

396
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:45,840
I'll talk to him

397
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:46,760
face to face.

398
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:48,480
I won't say yes even if he does.

399
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:55,360
Could you please help me here?

400
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,120
Ma'am.

401
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:57,120
Ms. Hua.

402
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:02,520
Mr. Chai.

403
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:05,240
I know

404
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:05,960
it's difficult for you

405
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:07,880
to act as a go-between.

406
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:10,560
What about this?

407
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:11,000
Please.

408
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,200
I'll give in a little.

409
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,720
You can tell them

410
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:15,680
that as long as

411
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,360
Chun Lei's name is above Peng's

412
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,320
in the credits,

413
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,440
maybe

414
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:22,800
there's still space for negotiation.

415
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:25,040
Ma'am,

416
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:27,720
you're a senior in the industry.

417
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:30,760
You certainly know that there's no such rule.

418
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:32,600
It's not appropriate

419
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,560
to put the supporting actor's name

420
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:36,160
above the leading actor's.

421
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,640
Why?

422
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:39,360
It's all about seniority.

423
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,560
Whether in terms of acting

424
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:41,400
or seniority,

425
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:41,960
don't you agree

426
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:44,080
that Chun Lei's name should be above Peng's?

427
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,720
Ms. Hua, according to you,

428
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:48,000
the actors who play parents in this series

429
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,080
are all senior artists.

430
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:50,760
So their names should be at the top of the credits?

431
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:51,560
Sure.

432
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:52,880
Go ahead.

433
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,800
I have no problem with putting these artists' names

434
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,720
above Chun Lei's.

435
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:58,520
But

436
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:00,800
definitely not below Peng's.

437
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:06,319
Mr. Chai.

438
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:07,920
I think

439
00:17:08,359 --> 00:17:09,359
we're still friends

440
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:11,760
even if we can't reach an agreement.

441
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,400
We have years ahead of us.

442
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,440
There may be plenty of opportunities for us.

443
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:15,880
Alright?

444
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:16,480
OK.

445
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:17,119
You're right.

446
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:18,720
Here.

447
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:19,560
Pour some tea

448
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:20,920
for Ms. Hua. The tea's cold.

449
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:24,839
We were too busy talking.

450
00:17:24,839 --> 00:17:26,680
I only noticed this girl when she got up.

451
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:28,359
So pretty.

452
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,440
Are you an actress?

453
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:31,600
No.

454
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,000
I work for Mr. Chai.

455
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:33,760
Ms. Hua,

456
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,240
if she were an actress,

457
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:36,120
she would be trembling in front of you,

458
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:37,680
given your status in the circle.

459
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,120
This is our new employee.

460
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:41,880
She just came back from abroad.

461
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:43,000
Here,

462
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:43,760
take this wine

463
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,240
and make a toast to Ms. Hua.

464
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,240
Ms. Hua,

465
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:48,240
allow me to borrow your wine

466
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,560
and make a toast to you.

467
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:51,840
It's my pleasure, Ms. Hua.

468
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:53,880
Take it easy.

469
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:55,480
You didn't have to.

470
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,840
People say that wine makes a coward bold.

471
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,760
May I speak my mind?

472
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:03,600
Go ahead.

473
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:05,920
If I happen to offend you,

474
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:07,240
I don't mean any of it.

475
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:08,680
I'm asking for your forgiveness in advance.

476
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:09,760
Just say it.

477
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:12,800
I

478
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,600
am not familiar with your industry.

479
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:16,680
But my cousin is an actress.

480
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:17,800
I don't remember

481
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:18,800
how many times

482
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,360
I've heard your name from her.

483
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,480
Let alone Chun Lei.

484
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:23,440
He's been a legend,

485
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,880
a great actor.

486
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:25,840
Young lady.

487
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,480
Don't beat around the bush.

488
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:28,480
Alright? Sit down.

489
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,280
Say what you want to say.

490
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:32,840
I really like Chun Lei's works.

491
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:34,080
He's a real man.

492
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:35,560
But today,

493
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:36,760
I heard from you

494
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:38,360
that he quit the role

495
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:39,320
just because it's a supporting role.

496
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:42,080
Suddenly, I think I had a wrong opinion about him.

497
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,120
Xiaoyu,

498
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,080
don't be ridiculous.

499
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:45,680
Let me be clear.

500
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:47,480
This is not Chun Lei's choice.

501
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:48,920
It's my decision.

502
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,040
No, ma'am.

503
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:51,640
I don't think this is your intention.

504
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:53,800
Because this decision

505
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:56,320
will only lead you to a dead end.

506
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:57,640
It's not humiliating at all

507
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:59,040
to be a supporting role for a newcomer.

508
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:00,360
It's an artist's virtue.

509
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,200
If a supporting actor

510
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:04,080
insists that his name appear above the leading actor's

511
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,200
only because of seniority,

512
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,080
this is something to be ashamed of.

513
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,400
You are among the top agents

514
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,680
in this industry with a high reputation.

515
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:12,320
I believe you won't do this.

516
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,560
As far as I can see,

517
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:14,560
you must be caught in between.

518
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:15,480
Xiaoyu,

519
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:16,680
watch your words.

520
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:17,520
Don't forget who you're talking to.

521
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:17,880
Well.

522
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:18,520
You

523
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:20,640
don't have to flatter me.

524
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:22,800
I bet you have more to say.

525
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:25,120
I'll indulge you today.

526
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,480
Say everything you want to say.

527
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:29,720
It's difficult for Mr. Chai

528
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:31,280
or the crew

529
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:32,920
to say something directly.

530
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,600
Even though

531
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:36,840
Chun Lei is unbeatable

532
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:37,680
in terms of experience,

533
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:38,360
acting,

534
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:39,840
and seniority,

535
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:41,800
from the platform's perspective,

536
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:44,160
he's not as popular as Peng.

537
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,760
Maybe

538
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,360
we should face the truth.

539
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:49,280
Then why don't you

540
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,640
just ask Peng to play the role?

541
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:53,320
Why do you have to get Chun Lei in?

542
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:55,920
The director doesn't care
if Chun Lei plays that role or not.

543
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,120
He always has alternatives

544
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,560
for the supporting role.

545
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:00,840
It's all for the sake of our client from Hai Lan.

546
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:02,720
He insists on Chun Lei playing that role.

547
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,760
If we choose someone else,

548
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:06,560
the deal will be broken.

549
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:08,800
This shows from another perspective

550
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:09,560
that Chun Lei

551
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:11,760
has his own value.

552
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:13,840
Ms. Hua,

553
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,280
you said

554
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,800
that Chun Lei only plays the leading role.

555
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,520
But let me ask you.

556
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:21,920
Do you think
there are no supporting roles in those series?

557
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:25,720
Do you mean
that none of the supporting roles is good enough

558
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:27,160
and they don't deserve our respect?

559
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,560
They are not ashamed of their roles.

560
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:30,840
Don't test my temper.

561
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,040
Go on.

562
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:36,920
At first,

563
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:38,840
it's because Chun Lei read the script

564
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:40,120
and liked this role

565
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:41,480
that he agreed to play it.

566
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,520
And he's always wanted
to cooperate with Director Ouyang, right?

567
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:45,440
Right.

568
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:47,040
Then what's the problem?

569
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:48,840
Chun Lei agreed to join the series

570
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:50,320
for the sake of the script and the director.

571
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,080
He didn't agree because Peng is in it.

572
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:54,280
If he gives up this role

573
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:55,120
only because

574
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,440
he doesn't want to be a supporting role

575
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:58,560
for a newcomer,

576
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,520
it will be such a shame.

577
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:02,080
What's more,

578
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:03,720
an actor should earn people's respect

579
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,960
by being good at his job.

580
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:07,800
If his name is on the top,

581
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,000
but his acting is lame,

582
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,440
don't you think it'll be more humiliating?

583
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:13,920
Whoever is the leading actor

584
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:15,360
will be responsible for the rating.

585
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:18,760
It must be such a relief on Chun Lei's part.

586
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:20,160
If the rating is good,

587
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:22,080
Chun Lei will be the one who deserves credit.

588
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:23,360
If the rating is bad,

589
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:25,120
Peng will be the target of criticism.

590
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,000
What will you lose?

591
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:29,240
Did you study accounting?

592
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:30,960
You certainly did some calculations.

593
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,360
I just have a thick skin.

594
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,040
If I have offended you already, then I'll just continue.

595
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:37,080
If I were Chun Lei,

596
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:38,880
I would not only play this role,

597
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:39,640
but also

598
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:42,000
help Peng with his acting

599
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,760
if I have time and energy.

600
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:46,280
We would work together
to present a good show to the audience.

601
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:48,080
Then, the producer,

602
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:48,760
the director,

603
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:50,080
and Peng,

604
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:50,880
would all

605
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,760
speak highly of Chun Lei.

606
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,160
The respect that Chun Lei earns this way

607
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:57,880
would be much more
than his name being on top of the credits.

608
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:59,440
Only when the experienced help the young

609
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,640
will this industry have a future.

610
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,480
What do you think, Ms. Hua?

611
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:09,240
As I said,

612
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:11,200
this is not Chun Lei's choice.

613
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,320
It's mine.

614
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:14,240
If you think we're petty,

615
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,640
then it's me,

616
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:17,040
not Chun Lei.

617
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:18,440
No, Ms. Hua.

618
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:19,600
As soon as you came in,

619
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,960
I've been listening to you talking.

620
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:23,760
You are clear-minded

621
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:26,280
and cool-headed.

622
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:28,240
You treat the talents as your own family.

623
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,920
You let them take all the glamour,

624
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:31,560
while you put up with all the trouble.

625
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:32,920
Across the industry,

626
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:34,080
everyone doesn't call you Big Sister

627
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:35,120
for nothing.

628
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:36,480
What's your name again?

629
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:37,720
Dai Xiaoyu.

630
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,200
Dai Xiaoyu, listen.

631
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:44,040
No one dares to speak of Chun Lei like this

632
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:45,440
in front of me.

633
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:47,640
You

634
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:49,400
gave me all the harsh words

635
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:51,480
and then made up with all the compliments.

636
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:52,880
You acted like you were so genuine

637
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:53,640
and straightforward.

638
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:54,920
You slapped me and then gave me some sugar.

639
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:56,240
You pretended to be joking but you actually meant it.

640
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:57,520
In fact,

641
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:00,480
it was just a desperate move.

642
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,240
You took a leap of faith.

643
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,760
Am I right?

644
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,280
Excuse me, Ms. Hua.

645
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:06,920
I just think that...

646
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:09,000
Don't tell me what you think.

647
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:12,200
I only care what I think.

648
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,680
I think

649
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:16,760
you're right.

650
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:21,160
Your words were harsh.

651
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:22,680
But I heard every one of it.

652
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:25,280
Do you know what moved me most?

653
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:29,560
You said

654
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:33,120
that only when the experienced help the young

655
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,040
will the industry have a future.

656
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:36,560
Even though you're young,

657
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:38,400
you are capable of saying something like this.

658
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,560
I have confidence in you.

659
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:41,080
Come on, pour me some wine.

660
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:43,080
Cheers, Ms. Hua.

661
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,640
Actually, you are not moved

662
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:49,160
by that sentence I said.

663
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:49,960
I know

664
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:52,440
you're weighing the pros and cons for Chun Lei.

665
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:57,720
Where did you find this clever one?

666
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:59,280
Ms. Hua, it's all fate.

667
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:00,680
Really, it's just fate.

668
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:03,080
Whether it was Chun Lei's decision

669
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:04,440
or mine,

670
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:05,520
from now on,

671
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:06,760
it's water under the bridge.

672
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:07,360
Mr. Chai,

673
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:10,120
ask the producer to send me the contract

674
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:11,720
tomorrow.

675
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:13,320
Initiate the law approval process.

676
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:14,840
We need more wine, Ms. Hua.

677
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,320
Use this cup.

678
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:19,800
Here, Xiaoyu.

679
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:20,320
Come on.

680
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:21,680
Thank you.

681
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:22,480
No problem.

682
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:23,360
Here you are.

683
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:25,640
Mr. Chai,

684
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:26,640
you don't need to

685
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:29,040
envy me for having so many talents.

686
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:31,080
You have Xiaoyu and that's enough.

687
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:31,640
Listen to me.

688
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:32,600
Treat her well.

689
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:34,400
Or I'll steal her from your company.

690
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:34,840
Of course.

691
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:36,480
I certainly will treat her well.

692
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:41,920
You said that your cousin

693
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:43,520
is an actress?

694
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,360
Yes.

695
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:46,120
She's not a star, just a random actress.

696
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:47,960
Let me add you on WeChat.

697
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:49,280
You may introduce her

698
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:51,120
to me someday.

699
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:51,920
Sure.

700
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:53,800
I won't brag about other things.

701
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:54,840
But in terms of acting,

702
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:56,400
I can tell immediately

703
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,080
if someone has the gift.

704
00:24:58,480 --> 00:24:59,480
That's great.

705
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,640
Ms. Hua agreed.

706
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:04,680
I told you that you can trust me.

707
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:07,360
You're bragging already.

708
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:08,320
Listen,

709
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:09,600
I agreed because I had some wine.

710
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,000
I may break my word tomorrow.

711
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,440
You won't.

712
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:25,000
Mr. Chai, what is this...

713
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:27,280
Dai Xiaoyu.

714
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:28,280
Tonight,

715
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:30,240
you made a great contribution.

716
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:31,640
This is your reward.

717
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:33,600
But this is too much.

718
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:36,040
Do you know how much we will make with this contract?

719
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:39,600
So it's only 1% of it.

720
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:40,440
Very appropriate.

721
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:42,040
Fine.

722
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,520
Then I'll take it.

723
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:44,560
Besides,

724
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:46,280
you really blew my mind this evening.

725
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:47,720
You put Ms. Hua

726
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:49,760
on a pedestal,

727
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:52,760
and then she couldn't get down.

728
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:54,960
I really didn't plan it.

729
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,520
You can't plan it.

730
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:59,400
It would be counterproductive.

731
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,240
Dai Xiaoyu, do you know

732
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:02,920
that you have three advantages

733
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:05,800
and you only used two of them?

734
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:08,000
First,

735
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:09,400
you're smart.

736
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,000
Second,

737
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,160
you can drink.

738
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:12,400
One bottle of wine

739
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:15,560
and you were on the right path to convince Ms. Hua.

740
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:17,480
Third,

741
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:19,000
you're pretty.

742
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:20,840
But with Ms. Hua,

743
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:23,200
you haven't got a chance to use it.

744
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:25,160
Once you make full use

745
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:26,520
of all your advantages,

746
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,720
you'll be unbeatable.

747
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:32,320
Dai Xiaoyu

748
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,760
will become

749
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:35,000
an indispensable figure

750
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,520
of our company.

751
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:40,040
Thanks for your advice, Mr. Chai.

752
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:41,160
Work hard.

753
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:42,280
Fighting!

754
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:53,440
I'm back.

755
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:54,600
Dad.

756
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:56,480
Where's your mother?

757
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:58,960
She's in a shower.

758
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:01,800
So you seized the chance to watch TV, right?

759
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:02,520
Right.

760
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:03,440
What are you watching?

761
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:04,960
The Dynasty of Sword.

762
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:06,360
Wow, an action movie.

763
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:08,560
You're early today.

764
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:10,480
I came back as soon as we finished.

765
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:11,600
How much did you drink today?

766
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:12,800
Just a bit.

767
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:14,000
You know Wu.

768
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,400
He wouldn't let anyone stay sober.

769
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:18,240
My son,

770
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,600
how's your homework going?

771
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,480
I've finished the math homework.

772
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:22,240
As to the composition...

773
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,000
I don't know how to write it.

774
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:24,480
You don't know how?

775
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:25,120
Ask your mother.

776
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:26,600
She can help you with it.

777
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:28,840
It's easy for you to give orders.

778
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:30,640
Daddy loves to give orders.

779
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:31,920
You majored in liberal arts.

780
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:34,360
You must be good at writing, right?

781
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:35,760
So you science students

782
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:37,040
are good at drinking?

783
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:37,520
Please.

784
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:39,440
It isn't that I love drinking or something.

785
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:41,560
If you don't love it, no one can force you.

786
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:45,320
It's just work and life.

787
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:48,960
You surely know how to sublimate yourself.

788
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:50,760
What else can I do?

789
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:53,600
Drinking is part of my job.

790
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:56,000
If I don't make money,

791
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:59,000
how can you live like this?

792
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,040
Live like what?

793
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:02,680
Look at me.

794
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:04,080
Do I look like my life is easy?

795
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:06,920
Come closer.

796
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:11,760
You're the mother of two kids.

797
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,240
Why are you still so beautiful?

798
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:17,640
Don't you get clever with me!

799
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:20,160
Have some mercy, please.

800
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:21,040
During the day,

801
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:22,080
I sit at my desk.

802
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:23,560
In the evening, I sit at the dinner table.

803
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:26,240
I almost got piles.

804
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:28,520
What's the subject of your composition?

805
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:29,640
"My Dad".

806
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:32,080
Isn't this a piece of cake?

807
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:33,080
You can just write

808
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:35,000
that your dad's name is Du Shijun.

809
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,560
During the day, he goes to work

810
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:37,600
and I go to school.

811
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:39,040
In the evening, he comes back from work

812
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,240
drunk

813
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:41,840
and sleepy.

814
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:43,080
I don't know how he thinks of me

815
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:44,560
and I don't know how I should think of him.

816
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:45,440
Hey, lady.

817
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:47,000
Who teaches one's son like that?

818
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,320
Please, tell me how you would do it.

819
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:52,880
Don't push me.

820
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:57,760
Zhuang.

821
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:00,120
Grab your notebook.

822
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:00,760
Come here.

823
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:02,400
Go. You can do it.

824
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:05,560
Have you finished?

825
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:06,760
OK, let's brush your teeth and go to bed.

826
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,920
It's just a composition.

827
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:16,320
Here.

828
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:17,080
Come here.

829
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:18,920
Here you are.

830
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:19,920
OK, I'll take it.

831
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:21,800
I don't want to eat it.

832
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:23,080
Fine, give it to me.

833
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:26,240
"My Dad".

834
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:28,520
Who is your dad?

835
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:29,760
Du Shijun.

836
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,160
What does he do?

837
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:33,800
He's an accountant.

838
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:35,960
Does your dad treat you well?

839
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:38,160
He treats me...

840
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:39,240
Yes, he treats me well.

841
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:41,200
Does your dad treat your mom well?

842
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,160
Not bad.

843
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:45,240
Who's the breadwinner

844
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:46,200
of the family?

845
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:16,200
Mom,

846
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:18,280
my dad fell asleep.

847
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:19,320
The composition is due on Monday.

848
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:21,000
I don't want to do it anymore today.

849
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,240
Then you don't have to do it.

850
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:23,680
Just go to bed.

851
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:25,200
I can close the door by myself.

852
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:26,800
Go right to sleep, alright?

853
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:41,840
You fell asleep?

854
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,240
No, I'm watching him.

855
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:45,040
You are watching him in your dreams.

856
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:46,840
Come on. Take a shower and go to sleep.

857
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:47,720
Where is he?

858
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:48,960
What are you talking about?

859
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:49,440
But...

860
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:51,240
Why did I think you could help with the homework?

861
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:53,680
I just rested my eyes for a bit.

862
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:54,720
You must be kidding me.

863
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:55,960
Where is he?

864
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:58,480
I already helped him set up the structure.

865
00:30:58,480 --> 00:30:59,560
Be quiet.

866
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:02,360
Take your shower.

867
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:53,760
It's midnight. When are you going to bed?

868
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:57,280
I've finally got some time to my own. Let me write more.

869
00:31:58,600 --> 00:31:59,920
You just go to bed, OK?

870
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:02,640
As soon as I took a shower,

871
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:04,120
I'm not sleepy anymore.

872
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,080
This Thursday

873
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:09,200
will be the parents' evening for Zhuang's class.

874
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,520
It's your turn.

875
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:12,960
What's the date on Thursday?

876
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:14,520
No.

877
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:15,800
Thursday...

878
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:16,400
I can't do it on Thursday.

879
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:17,800
I've got two meetings in the afternoon.

880
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:19,600
I almost forgot.

881
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:22,240
Zhuang is in the second grade now.

882
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:25,280
You've never shown up in his class.

883
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:27,280
The teacher has never met Zhuang's father.

884
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:30,000
This is exactly what is called "solo parenting".

885
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:33,200
What "solo parenting"?

886
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:35,680
That is tough.

887
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:37,040
So you know that's tough.

888
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:39,520
And you just comprehensively demonstrated

889
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:41,680
how a ghost father raises his children.

890
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,360
Hey, writer,

891
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:44,440
why did you waste

892
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:46,000
all your talent on me?

893
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:54,160
Maybe we actually need a babysitter.

894
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:56,000
That way, I'll have my own time.

895
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,200
And I'll use my talent in writing

896
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:00,800
and share your burden of raising the family.

897
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:05,240
Haven't we talked this through already?

898
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:06,720
I don't need you

899
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,560
to make money for this family.

900
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:09,880
You take just rest assured

901
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:11,640
and be a housewife.

902
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:13,440
How great is that!

903
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:16,640
I just

904
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:18,960
want to do something of my own.

905
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:22,480
Don't you think

906
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:24,560
I'm no different than a babysitter?

907
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:25,920
I can hire someone

908
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:27,360
to be the babysitter,

909
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:29,120
so that I can do something I want to do.

910
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:30,400
OK?

911
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:35,200
But the problem is

912
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:38,200
if some stranger lives in my house,

913
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:39,560
it will make me feel

914
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:41,040
that it's not my home.

915
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:43,160
Do you think I can still wear this after a shower?

916
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:44,120
Now, it's OK

917
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:45,880
even if I'm half-naked in my own house.

918
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:48,640
But if someone else is here,

919
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:50,000
it won't be appropriate.

920
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,960
I'll be so uncomfortable.

921
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:54,200
You're giving up eating in fear of choking.

922
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:55,520
No, I'm not.

923
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:58,280
Let's think about something specific.

924
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:00,240
Who will help the children with their homework?

925
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:02,080
You can't rely on the babysitter to do that, right?

926
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:03,640
At last, you have to do it yourself.

927
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:05,840
By then, you'll feel more tired than now.

928
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:09,280
I'll make the decision, alright?

929
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,440
Just hang in there for a bit longer.

930
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:12,520
As soon as the children go to middle school,

931
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:14,960
the boarding school,

932
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,760
you'll have all your time back.

933
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:17,880
You can do whatever you want,

934
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:18,880
whatever you love.

935
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:20,199
And I'll do it with you.

936
00:34:20,199 --> 00:34:22,080
Middle school is far away.

937
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:23,320
Nonsense.

938
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:26,080
I feel that I was pursuing you only yesterday.

939
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:26,960
And in the blink of an eye,

940
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:28,000
my children are this tall.

941
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,360
That is in the blink of your eye.

942
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:32,159
I lived through every second of it.

943
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:38,440
You see,

944
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:41,000
the kids will grow up without your knowing it.

945
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,199
By that time, even if you want to take care of them,

946
00:34:42,199 --> 00:34:43,760
they may not give you the chance.

947
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:47,360
Fine.

948
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:48,520
I got sleepy again.

949
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:49,000
Come on.

950
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:49,719
Let's go to bed.

951
00:34:49,719 --> 00:34:51,440
No. I'll finish this part.

952
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:54,920
OK.

953
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:55,840
Then I won't sleep, either.

954
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:57,880
I'll wait for you in bed.

955
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:14,280
Are you being cute with me?

956
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:15,960
How old are you?
