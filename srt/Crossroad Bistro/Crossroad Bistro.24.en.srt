He's only a chef.

I don't care.

Right now,

144
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,600
The last thing I can do

145

is to allow you to stay over tonight.

146
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,159

Otherwise, I'll call the police.

150

Did you come to save me from it

151
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,800
or confess your love?

I was returning the favor.

154

Every word I said was
from the bottom of my heart.

155

If these things

156
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,440
didn't happen,

157
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,680
would you keep these words
to yourself forever?

158
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:25,880
I realize

159
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,520
you really need to be pushed.

160
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:29,160
You started with

161

giving a long speech.

162
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,320
Have you ever thought about

163
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,679
what if I don't accept you?

164
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,000
How do you know
I haven't thought of it?

I have.

166

If I hadn't said these words,

167
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,640
I'd have been very contented

168
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:45,720
with just seeing you in the bistro.

169
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,240
If I said something you don't accept,

170
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,120
I'd resign tomorrow.

171

Resign?

How dare you?

173
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:54,520
Just imagine.

174
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:56,400
If you had rejected me

175
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,960
and I had to see you every day in the bistro,

176
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,080
how would I carry out my work?

177
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:05,320
When did I reject you?

178
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,080
Do you mean

179
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,200
you said yes?

180
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,720
I was going to say yes,

181
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,960
but now I need to consider it more.

182
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:16,480
Wait.

183
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,720
Consider what?

184
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:18,960
What do you need to consider?

185
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:21,160
I don't want you to think

186
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:24,440
the reason why I accept you

187
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,800
is that I fear the bistro
can't go well without you.

188
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,800
Why would I resign

189
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:29,880
if I'm doing a good job?

190
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:35,760
Repeat

191
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,200
what you just said.

192
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:39,180
What?

193
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:40,680
Say it.

194
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,240
Don't look at me like this.

195
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:47,160
Now my mind is a blank.

196
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:49,440
Take your time.

197
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,000
Think about it.

198
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,160
Feng Xi.

199
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,400
I don't know since when

200
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,360
I started to care about you.

201
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:14,760
When I saw you hustling

202
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:16,480
around the bistro,

203
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,000
I felt bad.

204
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,160
When I saw your ex

205
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,960
badgering you,

206
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:27,680
I felt bad.

207
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,200
I felt not only bad,

208
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:32,000
but heartbroken.

209
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,400
I think I am in love with you.

210
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,520
So I've decided that,

211
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,440
from now on,

212
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,880
you

213
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,240
will be taken care of by me.

214
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:12,360
Period.

215
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:15,960
What's wrong?

216
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,280
I'm fine.

217
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,480
I'm fine.

218
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:24,880
So, will you say yes?

219
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,040
Don't worry.

220
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,200
I will take good care of you.

221
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:27,880
Feng Xi.

222
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:28,840
What?

223
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:30,920
Do you carry your ID card with you?

224
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:32,920
Yes.

225
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:33,560
What's wrong?

226
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:34,440
Weren't you being kind

227
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:36,400
to let him stay over?

228
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:37,760
I'm worrying

229
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:38,880
you could be homeless.

230
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:43,000
I was going to stay in a hotel.

231
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,640
What about me?

232
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:54,160
Can't you go home?

233
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:56,560
It's not home

234
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:57,520
without you.

235
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,760
Why didn't I find

236
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:02,360
you are so glib?

237
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:05,080
I'm not glib.

238
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:06,320
I am just

239
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,560
being spontaneous.

240
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:10,160
All right.

241
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,720
You can sleep with your dad tonight.

242
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:13,120
And I'll sleep with your mom.

243
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,200
No problem.

244
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,560
I'm okay with that.

245
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,000
But I'm afraid my mom won't agree to it.

246
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:31,280
Feng Xi.

247
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,360
I don't blame you.

248
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:34,560
I don't have to think about it.

249
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:35,360
This bad idea

250
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,720
must come from Henan.

251
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:38,720
You don't need to apologize to me.

252
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:40,680
Mom.

253
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:42,200
Now you're relieved.

254
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,440
So, can I say

255
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:45,480
we didn't cheat you?

256
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,640
It's not cheating.

257
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:48,280
It's called,

258
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:50,240
"Good things take time."

259
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:50,720
Yes.

260
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:56,120
It isn't a wasted trip.

261
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:57,440
We're relieved to see

262
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,560
you two are together.

263
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:03,120
If I'm right,

264
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,480
Henan and you

265
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,840
have been into each other

266
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:07,120
for a while.

267
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:08,560
But

268
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:11,000
none of you wants to say it out,

269
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:11,600
right?

270
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:12,720
Auntie.

271
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,040
You have sharp eyes.

272
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:14,600
Yeah.

273
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,600
I've been an ideaistic mentor all my life.

274
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,760
A glance will suffice...

275
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,240
To see everything through!

276
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:29,000
Although you just started to get serious,

277
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:32,040
every word I said still counts.

278
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:33,600
Feng Xi.

279
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,720
Talk to your parents

280
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:37,320
and ask for their opinions.

281
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,480
All right?

282
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,160
Okay.

283
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:41,800
Then we shall meet together.

284
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:42,600
Dad.

285
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:43,920
Here we go again.

286
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:47,760
Bad boy.

287
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:48,880
You are a lucky dog.

288
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:05,520
Is everyone asleep?

289
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:06,760
Yes.

290
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,320
Will you finish soon?

291
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:12,920
Send.

292
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:13,840
Yes.

293
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:17,000
Not yet.

294
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,520
I'm still awake.

295
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,680
Who is that? It's so late.

296
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:21,560
You Shanshan.

297
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:22,960
She asked me if I'm awake.

298
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:35,080
Your face has fallen

299
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:37,400
since we finished dinner.

300
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:38,920
Tell me.

301
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:40,520
Are you angry with me?

302
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,000
The two audited statements need to

303
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,200
be approved tomorrow morning.

304
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,840
I'd feel unsettled if I didn't finish them.

305
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,600
I know you.

306
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:51,080
Since I told you

307
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,800
I paid the fine of 20,000 yuan,

308
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,240
you have been sulky.

309
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:57,120
I know you're upset.

310
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,400
I also feel sorry about the fine.

311
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:01,120
But it's my fault.

312
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,600
I was emotional then.

313
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:04,160
For the first time,

314
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,840
You Shanshan asked me for a favor.

315
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:07,760
I couldn't let her down,

316
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:08,800
right?

317
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:10,200
Yes.

318
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,280
This is why I think

319
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:12,280
you are awesome.

320
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,920
People run restaurants for profits.

321
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,120
But my wife runs the bistro

322
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,000
for loss.

323
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,360
Over 20,000 yuan per day.

324
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,560
See?

325
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,320
I knew you would bust on me.

326
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,560
I'm just kidding.

327
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,080
I'd be lying if I told you

328
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,080
I don't care about the fine.

329
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,120
But it's not like

330
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,040
the fine is killing me.

331
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:32,680
Let's just say it's your tuition fee.

332
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:35,880
I really understand.

333
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:36,760
If I were you,

334
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:37,640
I'd do so, too.

335
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:39,520
There, there.

336
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:40,440
Don't be stressed.

337
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:41,800
We can earn the money back.

338
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:43,920
Don't be depressed by that.

339
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,360
Are you really fine with it?

340
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:49,760
Could they return the money back

341
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:51,280
if I was furious?

342
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:52,160
What's more,

343
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:53,360
if the anger made me ill,

344
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,840
20,000 yuan doesn't suffice
to see a doctor.

345
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:55,440
Right?

346
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,040
Yes.

347
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:57,600
Good to see you're not angry.

348
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:02,640
Who's that again?

349
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:03,640
It's late at night.

350
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:04,720
Could it be You Shanshan?

351
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,240
She just asked me if I am still awake.

352
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:13,400
Who is it?

353
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:14,560
Mr. Du.

354
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:15,359
It's me,

355
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:16,680
Cheng Kai from Ms. You's company.

356
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:19,960
Mr. Du.

357
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:20,560
Mrs. Du.

358
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:21,280
Cheng.

359
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:21,760
I'm so sorry

360
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:22,839
to interrupt you so late.

361
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,240
Come in.

362
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:28,640
I am commissioned by Ms. You

363
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,160
to send this to you.

364
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:31,760
What is it?

365
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:37,560
What do you mean?

366
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:38,920
Ms. You said

367
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:39,800
the incident was due to

368
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:42,320
the poor management of the bistro.

369
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:42,920
The loss

370
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,120
cannot be taken by you.

371
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:44,680
No.

372
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:46,120
I had a poor attitude.

373
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:47,680
I should take responsibility.

374
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:48,800
I should pay the fine.

375
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,200
Don't say no again.

376
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,120
Ms. You is in a social activity now.

377
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:54,560
Otherwise, she'd come in person.

378
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:56,160
She also said

379
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,640
if you don't take it,

380
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:58,320
tomorrow

381
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:59,960
I won't be allowed to enter the company.

382
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:02,480
Please don't give me a hard time.

383
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:05,440
Then take it.

384
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,120
Don't put him in a tough position.

385
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,880
Later you can talk to Shanshan
when you meet her.

386
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:12,840
All right.

387
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:14,120
Thank you

388
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:15,440
for coming late at night.

389
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:16,640
You're welcome.

390
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:18,160
Good night.

391
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:18,920
See you.

392
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:19,960
See you later.

393
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,840
This is very inappropriate.

394
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:35,480
You Shanshan

395
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:37,520
is decent.

396
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:41,400
If you don't take the money,

397
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,600
you will be more embarrassed
when seeing her next time.

398
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:46,520
Ba Xiaoding.

399
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:48,760
It must be her who betrayed me.

400
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,640
She is on You Shanshan's payroll.

401
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:55,560
Why would she be on your team?

402
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:57,120
Besides,

403
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:58,800
the money doesn't hurt you.

404
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:01,640
That's true.

405
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:03,960
All right.

406
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:06,240
That's it.

407
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,080
Tomorrow morning, take the kids to school

408
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:10,240
and I'll send the statements.

409
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:11,800
Let's go to bed.

410
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,640
Happy?

411
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:15,280
Are you happy to see the money?

412
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:16,400
Why would I be happy?

413
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:18,360
I'll sleep with it under my pillow.

414
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:26,600
I seemed to

415
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:28,920
be buried in dirt for a day.

416
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:30,680
Did you play the role of a groundhog?

417
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:31,760
That's pretty much it.

418
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:33,040
My servant.

419
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:34,200
Get me a seat.

420
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:35,280
Yes, my lady.

421
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,600
Do you think

422
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,080
I can go to the hospital now?

423
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:44,600
It's late.

424
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:45,880
If you go now,

425
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:46,960
Xiaoyu will already be asleep.

426
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,440
What about tomorrow morning?

427
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,080
Songyang.

428
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:00,000
I'd like to ask you a serious question.

429
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,440
How serious?

430
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:04,640
If I can't

431
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,240
have a baby,

432
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:08,640
will you dislike me?

433
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:15,240
You are hesitating!

434
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:17,280
I'm not.

435
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,840
Slow responses

436
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:19,600
are lies.

437
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,520
I can go for DINK.

438
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:23,360
I just

439
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:24,960
thought about Xiaoyu.

440
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,520
I was thinking of my cousin.

441
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,480
What is she going to do?

442
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:43,240
Now many people don't want kids.

443
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:45,600
I'm telling you.

444
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:46,720
They don't want kids

445
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:47,680
mostly because

446
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:49,240
they think raising kids is too stressful.

447
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:50,400
But when they are better off,

448
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,440
they will regret it.

449
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:52,400
Think about the rich.

450
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,120
How many of them don't want kids?

451
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:56,920
I know many people divorce

452
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:59,600
because they don't have kids.

453
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:02,520
I can't agree with you.

454
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:04,880
We can't use kids

455
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:07,120
to maintain our marriage.

456
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,360
I also heard that

457
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:12,200
men without kids

458
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,760
don't want to go home.

459
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:16,480
Where did you hear that from?

460
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,040
Those who love their family

461
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:19,440
want to go home.

462
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:20,200
Those who don't

463
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:22,080
won't go home even if you have eight kids.

464
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:26,480
I have an idea.

465
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:28,720
Another terrible idea?

466
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,240
I mean it.

467
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,000
Sit still and listen to me.

468
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:36,600
I've decided that

469
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:39,800
no matter whom my cousin will marry,

470
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:41,960
no matter whether this man
wants to go home,

471
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:44,280
if we

472
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:46,680
have two kids,

473
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:47,360
one of them

474
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:48,920
can call Xiaoyu Mom,

475
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:49,680
all right?

476
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,920
I'm okay with that.

477
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:57,760
But...

478
00:21:58,120 --> 00:21:58,840
What?

479
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:01,760
Could they not call that guy Dad?

480
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:03,960
I'll kill you!

481
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:05,840
I'm just kidding.

482
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:06,480
Got it?

483
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,080
Stop kidding me.

484
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,320
Get up.

485
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,840
We need to go to the station.

486
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:34,960
Get up.

487
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:52,480
Henan.

488
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:54,600
Thank you for showing us around these days.

489
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,240
Sleep more.

490
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,280
We changed our train to this morning.

491
00:23:58,280 --> 00:23:59,400
Now we are aboard.

492
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:01,600
They already left?

493
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:05,480
Feng Xi is a good girl.

494
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:07,440
We like her very much.

495
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:08,640
Treat her well.

496
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,400
Listen to her every word.

497
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,640
Her life in Beijing isn't easy.

498
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:13,840
You need to

499
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:15,760
give her a sense of security.

500
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,920
We wish you happiness.

501
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:19,640
I'm not nagging you.

502
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:21,200
When Feng Xi makes her decision,

503
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,400
tell me.

504
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,520
We'll go to Hubei to make a proposal.

505
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:27,000
But you can't rush her or force her.

506
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,520
She'll make her own decisions.

507
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:32,320
See?

508
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:33,680
This ideaistic mentor

509
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:35,200
is really good at talking.

510
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:37,680
Auntie is impressive.

511
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:40,600
She makes me feel if I don't marry you,

512
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:42,160
I'll feel sorry for her.

513
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:42,960
Don't.

514
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,520
Please don't feel that

515
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:45,840
Mom is guilting you.

516
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:46,680
Really.

517
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,200
You have the control.

518
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,800
If you don't want to marry me,

519
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:52,080
it's okay.

520
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:53,840
I didn't say no.

521
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,160
Then,

522
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:58,200
why not

523
00:24:58,560 --> 00:24:59,720
give me a deadline?

524
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:01,920
Deadline?

525
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,480
It's not a task.

526
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:04,720
See?

527
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:06,360
You are not sincere again.

528
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:09,640
I'm afraid you won't treasure me

529
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:11,440
if I marry you too early.

530
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:17,840
What's the point of being early or late?

531
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:20,120
You and your ex...

532
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:21,520
You waited ten long years.

533
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:22,520
In the end,

534
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:23,640
he's not reliable.

535
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:25,240
A ten-year relationship isn't reliable.

536
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:26,360
Will our flash marriage be reliable?

537
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:28,160
It's not a flash marriage.

538
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:30,320
Look.

539
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,760
We have spent time together for a long time.

540
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:34,920
We also know each other.

541
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:35,960
Besides,

542
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,560
we are not newly acquainted.

543
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:39,920
That's right.

544
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:46,000
I'm just not ready.

545
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:58,040
Do you want to marry me?

546
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,560
What?

547
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:00,680
You can't wait?

548
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:05,760
I can't wait.

549
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:07,000
Auntie said that

550
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:07,880
you can't rush me.

551
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:09,120
I have the control.

552
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:10,720
Naughty girl.

553
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:18,440
You took advantage of me.

554
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:20,960
Watch it.

555
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,640
I just seized the opportunity.

556
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,080
Are you willing to marry me?

557
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:33,840
Well, even a ten-year relationship
isn't reliable.

558
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,400
You are the one.

559
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:37,280
I don't want to bother
to find another one.

560
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:39,880
Give me a deadline.

561
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:44,080
Now you have the control.

562
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:45,280
You can set a deadline.

563
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:48,440
Don't regret it.

564
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,360
I won't.

565
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:02,840
Mom.

566
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:04,040
We are getting married.

567
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:05,280
See you in Jingzhou, Hubei.

568
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:07,920
This is too soon.

569
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:10,200
I haven't told my parents.

570
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:12,560
You gave the control to me.

571
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:14,200
Look.

572
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:16,000
I'll go to your hometown with you.

573
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,200
We will tell

574
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:18,480
your parents together.

575
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:25,760
I thought we were not serious.

576
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:30,280
But now, we have a home.

577
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:33,280
Yes.

578
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,000
I thought we were not serious.

579
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:38,000
But now, we have a home.

580
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:47,800
I love you.

581
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:56,720
Manager Feng.

582
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:58,880
Manager Feng.

583
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:00,960
Could you refocus on our business?

584
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:03,400
What?

585
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:05,640
Zhao Henan's parents have left.

586
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:07,040
Why do you need a week more?

587
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:11,600
Stop beating around the bush.

588
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:13,800
I'm telling you that this week,

589
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:15,720
All my time was used on the road

590
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:17,640
between the bistro and the company.

591
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:19,800
Cut the crap!

592
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:22,720
Bao Xue is filming.

593
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:24,840
Xiaoyu doesn't feel well recently.

594
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:28,920
Or can you ask Henan to come back first?

595
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:31,880
Both of you!

596
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:34,000
What are you going to do?

597
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:39,880
Okay.

598
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:41,080
I won't ask.

599
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:42,680
A week, right?

600
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:44,560
If you don't return after a week,

601
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:46,080
I will get someone else.

602
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:52,160
Okay.

603
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:53,000
A week.

604
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,360
Only a week.

605
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:55,640
Bye.

606
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:58,040
Your friend was looking for you.

607
00:28:58,520 --> 00:28:59,080
Who is it?

608
00:28:59,080 --> 00:28:59,800
I don't know.

609
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:01,360
Where is the person now?

610
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:02,200
He said

611
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:03,800
he will wait for you at the cafe.

612
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:05,160
That's it.

613
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:18,920
Dalong.

614
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:21,840
Shanshan.

615
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:24,560
Long time no see.

616
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:26,160
You still remember me.

617
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,040
I'm so happy.

618
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:28,320
How could I forget you?

619
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:29,640
I've seen you on TV many times recently.

620
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:30,600
Really?

621
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:32,200
Your career is on a prosperity

622
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:32,880
No, no.

623
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:33,760
You are better than me.

624
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:34,760
We're not comparable.

625
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:35,920
We're not in the same industry.

626
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:36,600
Want some drink?

627
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:37,640
The same as usual.

628
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:38,160
OK.

629
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:41,760
You look good.

630
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:42,440
Really?

631
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:43,680
If you'd listened to me,

632
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:44,920
you could have been famous earlier.

633
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:46,320
Mr. Hei told me

634
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:47,920
you are smart

635
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:48,800
and talented,

636
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:50,120
but you just don't know where to go.

637
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:51,560
You know what?

638
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:53,000
Thank you so much

639
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,320
for criticizing me.

640
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:55,880
Otherwise, I couldn't have been where I am today.

641
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:58,320
All right.

642
00:29:58,640 --> 00:29:59,760
My pleasure.

643
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:01,360
Since we met last time,

644
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:02,160
it's been...

645
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:05,000
Four or five years, right?

646
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:05,880
Four years or five years?

647
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:07,200
Five years. Almost five years.

648
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,360
I remember it's five years.

649
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:10,000
How time flies!

650
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:10,680
Sure.

651
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:15,320
Three, two, one, go!

652
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:19,360

How is it?

687
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:32,480
To be honest?

688
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:33,680
Of course.

689
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:36,000
I've seen many musicians

690
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,240
who visited Mr. Hei.

691
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:37,800
You

692
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:38,560
are very talented.

693
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:39,440
Speak louder, please.

694
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:41,080
Please.

695
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:42,280
You are very talented.

696
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:42,920
Thanks.

697
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:46,360
But don't do concerts here.

698
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:47,760
Where can I go?

699
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:49,200
How can you be famous

700
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,600
by doing concerts here?

701
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:52,600
I don't want to be famous.

702
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:53,880
I think I'm good.

703
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,560
Those who are not as good as you

704
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:58,280
have signed with companies

705
00:31:58,280 --> 00:31:59,800
and have been in many shows.

706
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:01,440
They are both famous and rich.

707
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:02,360
Look at you.

708
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:04,360
I think I am fine.

709
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:06,280
I don't want to be a star.

710
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:07,240
Let it go.

711
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:09,040
See.

712
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:10,040
Every time I talk about this,

713
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:11,800
he becomes defiant.

714
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:12,720
It's okay.

715
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:14,560
I was young once.

716
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:16,120
It's not a problem.

717
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:18,000
Continue

718
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:19,160
to sing.

719
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:19,600
Yeah.

720
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:21,120
Here we go.

721
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:24,800
♫Orchid grows on the mountaintop♫

722
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:27,440
♫Emitting rich fragrance
among rocks and cracks♫

723
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:29,880
You're right.

724
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:32,080
Doing concerts at home every day

725
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:33,200
can't help me be famous.

726
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:33,840
Right?

727
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:35,680
You still remember it.

728
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:37,000
Did you hold a grudge?

729
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,680
Kind of.

730
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:41,520
Those young people who used to play with you...

731
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:42,760
How are they?

732
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:44,400
Everyone has been busy recently.

733
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:45,760
We are not keeping in touch.

734
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:48,320
Did they think I was a fool back then?

735
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:50,200
I began to lecture you once I walked in.

736
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:52,080
They didn't think you were a fool.

737
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:54,000
But they thought you were mysterious.

738
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:55,360
Come on.

739
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:56,880
I am mysterious?

740
00:32:58,440 --> 00:32:59,920
Go ahead.

741
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:01,720
Stop drinking and tell me everything.

742
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:05,000
I am just organizing my thoughts.

743
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,040
You two are so gossipy.

744
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:07,160
Take it easy.

745
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:08,040
So,

746
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:10,120
what do you two want to know?

747
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:11,280
I just want to know that

748
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:12,320
since she keeps nagging you,

749
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:14,160
don't you find her annoying?

750
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:15,840
Yeah.

751
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:17,200
If we nagged you like that,

752
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:17,960
you would be furious.

753
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:18,760
Yes.

754
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:23,520
It's a long story.

755
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:25,480
You guys know that

756
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:27,200
I respect Mr. Hei very much, right?

757
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:27,840
Yes.

758
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:29,680
Do you know

759
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:31,360
why he has disappeared

760
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:33,720
from the network since last year?

761
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:35,800
Because of her?

762
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:36,720
Yes.

763
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:38,240
She is a Sugar Mama?

764
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:39,040
Sugar Mama?

765
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:39,680
Shanshan

766
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:42,440
isn't born with a silver spoon.

767
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:46,080
She made the silver spoon.

768
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:47,600
She has kids?

769
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:48,720
She divorced.

770
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:49,800
Later she focused on

771
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:51,280
her career.

772
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:53,400
Now she is quite successful.

773
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:55,200
Or I won't respect her so much.

774
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:57,160
It's said she met Mr. Hei

775
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:59,320
in a social activity.

776
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:01,640
At that time, Shanshan

777
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:03,000
loved playing the drum.

778
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,280
She desperately wanted to learn from Mr. Hei

779
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:06,640
and asked him to teach her.

780
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:08,080
You know that Mr. Hei

781
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:09,639
is always smiley

782
00:34:11,159 --> 00:34:12,320
and doesn't refuse people.

783
00:34:12,679 --> 00:34:14,000
Luckily,

784
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,960
they kept a proper distance

785
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,280
except for having one lesson

786
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:20,199
every week.

787
00:34:20,199 --> 00:34:21,360
Until one day,

788
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:22,960
something happened.

789
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:29,480
Shanshan had a friend

790
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:30,960
living in Mi County.

791
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:31,960
Her friend opened a bar.

792
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:34,159
Shanshan graciously invited Mr. Hei

793
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:36,199
to attend the opening ceremony.

794
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:37,960
Unfortunately,

795
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:39,159
at that night,

796
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:41,159
a local gang

797
00:34:41,159 --> 00:34:42,400
got drunk.

798
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:43,120
They created a scene

799
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:43,880
and fought.

800
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:45,480
It was a huge fight.

801
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:47,480
It's said someone even died.

802
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:49,120
I know it.

803
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:49,400
Right?

804
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:50,400
I saw it on TV.

805
00:34:52,199 --> 00:34:53,560
That night was chaotic.

806
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:54,679
Shanshan

807
00:34:54,679 --> 00:34:55,880
got stuck in the toilet.

808
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:57,080
Mr. Hei came to rescue her.

809
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:58,400
The two of them

810
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,680
were just about to rush out hand-in-hand.

811
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:02,680
Suddenly a bunch of hooligans came toward

812
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:04,160
and surrounded them.

813
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:06,920
Shanshan was brave.

814
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:07,880
At that time,

815
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:10,680
she immediately stood in front of Mr. Hei

816
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:12,480
to protect him.

817
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:16,360
So cool, right?

818
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:18,600
They

819
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:19,920
held one bottle in their left hands

820
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:21,160
and another in their right hands.

821
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:23,560
They fought their way out.

822
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:24,960
When they were about to
rush out of the bar,

823
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:27,000
they met another bunch of hooligans.

824
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,440
One of them

825
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:30,280
held a knife in hand.

826
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:32,040
Without any reason,

827
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:33,280
the guy rushed to cut Shanshan.

828
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:34,760
Seeing that,

829
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:36,000
Mr. Hei rushed

830
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:38,760
and used his left hand to parry.

831
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:41,320
How could he use his hand to parry?

832
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:42,120
You know

833
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:43,600
Mr. Hei is an artist.

834
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:45,400
He didn't know how to fight.

835
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:48,640
What happened later?

836
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:49,480
I heard that these hooligans

837
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:50,920
were caught.

838
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:52,520
The police got them all.

839
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:54,000
I heard that the longest jail sentence

840
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,520
is ten years.

841
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:58,480
But I feel sorry for Mr. Hei's hand.

842
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:02,120
He uses his hand to make a living.

843
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:04,680
Poor guy.

844
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:08,000
Luckily, his joint was repaired

845
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
by surgery.

846
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:12,000
But Shanshan still thought

847
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,680
she owed Mr. Hei a lot.

848
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:16,320
She decided to take care
of him for the rest of his life.

849
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:18,560
But Mr. Hei is independent.

850
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:19,400
Later, Shanshan invested

851
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:21,120
in a studio for him.

852
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:23,400
He doesn't play the drum anymore.

853
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:25,800
Now he makes drums.

854
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:29,360
Now you know

855
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:31,240
why I respect them so much.

856
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:33,240
This couple is respectable.

857
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:34,280
Look at you.

858
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:35,560
They are not a couple.

859
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:36,920
Well,

860
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:38,080
they are not a couple,

861
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:39,280
but they are better than a couple.

862
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:42,200
Dalong.

863
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:44,440
This time you visit me

864
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:45,800
is not only for catching up, right?

865
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:47,400
You can guess.

866
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:50,080
Just get to the point.

867
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:52,480
Investment or connections?

868
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:53,040
Wow.

869
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:54,400
You really are a boss.

870
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,040
You get to the point.

871
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:57,760
But

872
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:59,800
I don't actually need

873
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,320
the two things you said.

874
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:02,480
What else do you want?

875
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:04,200
I'll get to the point, then.

876
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:05,000
Say it.

877
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:06,640
Well, Shanshan.

878
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:08,680
After I went famous,

879
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:10,720
I found so many young people

880
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:11,920
are just like the young version of me.

881
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:13,240
They also need platforms.

882
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:14,480
In fact, these young people

883
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:16,080
are very talented.

884
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:17,640
But I'm afraid there's no place
to develop their talents.

885
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:18,560
So,

886
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:20,120
I produced a show.

887
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:20,960
I've already invited

888
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:21,880
popular musicians

889
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:23,560
to be mentors

890
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:24,560
in this show.

891
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:26,520
But one important position

892
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:27,440
is still vacant.

893
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:28,640
The music director.

894
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:33,200
Are you trying to

895
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:34,760
invite Mr. Hei?

896
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:35,560
Yes.

897
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:36,920
Then talk to him.

898
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:38,680
If this can work,

899
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:40,280
why will I talk to you?

900
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:40,920
You've tried?

901
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:42,040
I've tried.

902
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:43,640
But it didn't work at all.

903
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:45,200
You know Mr. Hei.

904
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:46,680
When I was talking to him,

905
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:48,120
he looked at me with a smile on his face.

906
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:51,560
Or he used his hand as an excuse.

907
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:53,200
I said, "Bro,

908
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:54,360
don't fool me.

909
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:56,360
You have already recovered.

910
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:57,960
And you're independent."

911
00:37:58,440 --> 00:37:59,160
Yes.

912
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:01,120
I gave him the best offer.

913
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:02,200
The best offer.

914
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:03,800
But he still said no.

915
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:04,520
He didn't want to come.

916
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:08,600
He's always been like that.

917
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:09,680
He won't do anything

918
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:11,160
if he doesn't want to.

919
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:12,200
He doesn't care about

920
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:13,480
people's reputations and money.

921
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:15,120
I know.

922
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:16,880
But you also know his influence

923
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:18,040
in the music industry.

924
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:19,240
He is the big shot.

925
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:21,720
I worry that if he doesn't come,

926
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,000
my show will be a failure.

927
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:26,880
Please help me.

928
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:30,840
I'm not sure if I could.

929
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:34,160
Have a try, okay?

930
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:35,320
Give it a try.

931
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:36,320
I'm waiting for the good news.

932
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:37,560
Wait.

933
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:39,720
I can't promise to give you the good news.

934
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:40,880
But I can guarantee

935
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:42,240
I can get you some information.

936
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:44,480
That will work.

937
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:46,120
Try your best, Shanshan.

938
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:47,480
Try your best.

939
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:49,800
All right.

940
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:17,000
Sir.

941
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:18,480
Could I

942
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:19,720
bum a cigarette?

943
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:22,920
Thanks.

944
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:41,880
Flying abroad?

945
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:42,520
Yes.

946
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:44,000
Where are you heading to?

947
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:45,640
Munich.

948
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:46,640
What about you?

949
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:48,200
Oslo.

950
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:04,040
See you.

951
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:14,600
