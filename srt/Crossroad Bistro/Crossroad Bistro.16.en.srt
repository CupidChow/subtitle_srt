he has to cooperate with the investigation, right?

175
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:59,160
Recording witness statement.

176
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,600
And contacting the victim's family.

177
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:04,400
When the family members are there,
 he has to help with the funeral.

178
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,960
After all these things are done,

179
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:07,360
don't you have to allow him

180
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,240
to grieve for his dead buddy?

181
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,200
He's got this bunch of things.

182
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:13,080
Does he have time to reply to you?

183
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:13,960
What about me?

184
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,960
I'm so unimportant in his heart, am I?

185
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,160
Look at you.

186
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:28,200
Little woman's little mind

187
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,720
is what you have.

188
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,000
Did you act to be generous

189
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,200
with us before?

190
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,880
I am a little woman.

191
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:34,520
From now on,

192
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:36,760
I won't act to be generous.

193
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:38,920
Fine.

194
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:42,680
Don't come back.

195
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,640
I won't meet him when he comes back.

196
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:42,560
[Zhang Zhiyuan]

197
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:40,080
[Zhang Zhiyuan]

198
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:41,560
Zhiyuan.

199
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,560
I'll remember my promise.

200
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:48,120
[Zhang Zhiyuan]

201
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,200
I will have you beside me to the summit.

202
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:20,200
Yu Songyang.

203
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:24,640
What do you think life's about?

204
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:27,360
Why are you asking this?

205
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:32,120
I just saw Zhiyuan's epitaph saying that

206
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:35,720
life is about challenging ourselves.

207
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:38,760
Yeah.

208
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:43,320
Is it?

209
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:48,160
What do you think?

210
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:51,720
I think life is about

211
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:53,760
the pursuit of happiness.

212
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:04,160
Maybe we have different understandings.

213
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,240
I don't think it's different understandings.

214
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,560
I think we have different values.

215
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,360
Don't talk about the values.

216
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,560
Everyone is independent.

217
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:18,840
We don't have to be consistent.

218
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:23,920
Yu Songyang. You are so selfish to say that.

219
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:27,200
Since the day of Zhiyuan's accident,

220
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,440
I have been worried as hell.

221
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:30,400
I'm afraid that one day,

222
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,160
I can never meet you again.

223
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,240
When I was in the cemetery today,

224
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:38,880
I looked at the tombstone

225
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:39,480
and thought,

226
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:41,680
"If the name engraved on the tombstone is yours,

227
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:43,800
what should I do?"

228
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:48,360
When I think of it, I feel terrified.

229
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:50,520
Yet I can't help but think that.

230
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:55,280
Challenging ourselves.

231
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:00,520
You lost your friend to challenges.

232
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:02,080
Do you still want to continue?

233
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,600
Are you finished?

234
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,040
Can you understand when I tell you?

235
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:08,520
Challenges come with risks.

236
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:10,800
No one wants it to happen.

237
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,200
What happened, happened!

238
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:16,840
What happened, happened?

239
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:23,240
That's easy to say.

240
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:24,880
Yes. I'm telling you.

241
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,600
I can't understand at all.

242
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:27,520
Zhiyuan is so young.

243
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,160
Should he end like this?

244
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,120
Have you guys

245
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:34,080
thought about your parents?

246
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:35,560
Don't you feel a little guilty

247
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:38,280
towards the people who gave you life?

248
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:39,840
Yu Songyang. Let me ask you.

249
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:42,360
Were you scared when that happened?

250
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,240
Yes.

251
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:54,920
I stuck my whole body to the cliff

252
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:56,440
and didn't dare to move.

253
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:02,040
What was in your mind?

254
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:03,440
What could I think?

255
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:04,600
My legs were shaking.

256
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:06,120
I would have died without a safety rope.

257
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:07,600
So you know that!

258
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:09,480
And you still want to climb?

259
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:13,520
Have you thought about me?

260
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,080
Have you ever thought about

261
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:19,800
whether Bao Xue would worry about me?

262
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:21,360
What if Bao Xue collapses

263
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:22,560
if I die?

264
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:23,880
What if Bao Xue is scared?

265
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:26,120
Have you ever thought of me for a moment?

266
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:28,920
Listen. Yu Songyang

267
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:29,800
Till today,

268
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:32,280
I have never been so worried about a person.

269
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,400
This feeling sucks!

270
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:37,880
I don't ever want to experience it again.

271
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,360
Sorry.

272
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:44,680
I owe you an apology.

273
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:45,320
I'm sorry.

274
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:46,720
Don't say sorry to me.

275
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:48,200
I want a word from you today.

276
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:51,640
Either you quit risking your life or quit me.

277
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:53,440
Pick one.

278
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:01,280
Xue, you're tired.

279
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,640
Let me drive you home to have some rest, okay?

280
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:03,400
Pull over.

281
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:04,720
Would you stop that?

282
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,640
I'm asking you to pull over!

283
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:09,000
If you don't stop the car, I'll jump!

284
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:41,360
Xue, do you have to make a scene?

285
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:49,520
Do you still think I'm making a scene?

286
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:51,840
Didn't we agree that

287
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:54,240
we'll never force each other

288
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:56,040
to make any decisions against their will?

289
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:04,200
Yes.

290
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:06,760
I said that.

291
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:08,720
Let's calm down and go home, OK?

292
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:10,840
Can I force myself now?

293
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:11,760
I force myself

294
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,640
to leave you now.

295
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:38,840
♫ Don't look back♫

296
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:42,060
♫ Just let me go♫

297

♫ Give me a warm hug♫

298

♫ I can't curb my enthusiasm♫

♫ It's the promise I'll never break♫

303
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:44,360
Can I ask you something?

304
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:46,400
Sure.

305
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:50,360
Are you still in touch with

306
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:52,000
that intern recently?

307
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,560
Why are you mentioning her?

308
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:58,320
I'm just asking

309
00:26:58,320 --> 00:26:59,880
if you are still in touch.

310
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:01,080
Of course not.

311
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:02,680
I never contacted her.

312
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:04,640
It's been a while.

313
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:06,120
Are you still on that?

314
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:08,600
I just saw a mistress

315
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:09,920
in that TV show.

316
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:11,560
I let my imagination run wild.

317
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:14,280
If you think I cheat on you

318
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:15,480
when you see a mistress on TV,

319
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:16,680
then can I do the same

320
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:17,920
when I see a mister?

321
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:20,120
I'll find one if you say so.

322
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,280
So you're not in touch with her.

323
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:23,560
No need to yell.

324
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:25,280
Do your work!

325
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:35,480
Unreasonable.

326
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:37,000
This is your desk.

327
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:39,000
This is your name badge.

328
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,520
This is a new colleague

329
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:46,040
in our company.

330
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:47,200
Let's give her a warm welcome.

331
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:51,200
Hi, everyone.

332
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,240
My name is Wei Lan.

333
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:53,720
It's a pleasure to meet you all.

334
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:55,600
Pretty girl.

335
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:09,240
[Someone's wife]

336
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:23,520
See you soon.

337
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:50,920
A creamy mushroom soup.

338
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:53,000
And a traditional beef pasta.

339
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:28,560
How can you be sure

340
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:30,560
it was me who's waiting for you?

341
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,800
Mr. Du showed me your picture.

342
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:49,080
Don't you realize that

343
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:51,480
this is a battle

344
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:53,600
that hurts both sides?

345
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,840
As long as it hurts you worse, I'm happy.

346
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,200
How did you

347
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:06,720
hook up with him?

348
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:10,800
I won't answer this question.

349
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:11,960
Slept together?

350
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:15,440
Check the photo.

351
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:16,880
Let the facts speak.

352
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:29,400
What do you want?

353
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:37,000
I want to tell you that

354
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:39,200
your relationship is not what you want.

355
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:40,800
Do you know what I want?

356
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:43,560
You are so old enough.

357
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:45,520
Do you have to ask me?

358
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:54,440
This is between you two.

359
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:56,160
Solve it by yourself.

360
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:57,440
Don't badger me.

361
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:58,760
Please.

362
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:01,160
It's not between me and him.

363
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:02,600
It's between you and him.

364
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:06,720
There is a problem with your marriage.

365
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,639
Are you the one to talk about

366
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:10,360
the problem with our marriage?

367
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:13,360
Doesn't this involve me?

368
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:15,800
You asked me to talk.

369
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:23,080
Do you know what marriage is?

370
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:26,360
No.

371
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:27,960
Marriage

372
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:30,000
is at least a commitment.

373
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:30,880
Do you know that?

374
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:35,280
This commitment

375
00:34:35,719 --> 00:34:37,120
is confirmed

376
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:39,040
by the life of every day, every minute

377
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:40,440
and every second.

378
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:43,080
You can see how vulnerable his commitment is.

379
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,600
What you have locked in your drawer

380
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:47,880
is a contract of marriage.

381
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:49,360
You

382
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:51,600
are no longer in his heart.

383
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,800
How can you be so shameless?

384
00:34:58,400 --> 00:34:59,960
You are not so decent.

385
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:00,920
What do you want?

386
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:02,520
What exactly do you want?

387
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:06,280
I think

388
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:08,160
if a man

389
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:10,920
has done nasty things,

390
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:12,800
he should not pretend to be a gentleman,

391
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:13,920
just be nasty all the way.

392
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:15,880
That's a cool persona.

393
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:17,320
Persona.

394
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:19,000
Do you know what a persona is?

395
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:20,880
It's personality

396
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:21,880
and breeding.

397
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:24,120
You have a vulgar personality

398
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:25,440
and poor breeding.

399
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:29,080
Look at how miserable you are right now.

400
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:32,080
That attitude really isn't helping.

401
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:34,880
Waitress.

402
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:38,040
A cup of coffee.

403
00:35:58,720 --> 00:35:59,400
Extra sugar.

404
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:47,480
Remember to

405
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:49,880
pick up Zhuang at 4:30

406
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:52,240
and Yuanyuan at 5 o'clock.

407
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:53,640
What happened now?

408
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:54,560
I'm leaving.

409
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:58,280
You can have the house from now on.

410
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:00,240
You can invite

411
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:01,480
whoever you want to invite.

412
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:05,040
Hello?

413
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:08,520
Mrs. Du?

414
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:11,360
Who else can it be?

415
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:12,720
What's wrong?

416
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:15,080
I have no clue.

417
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:16,440
She was fine in the morning.

418
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:17,160
She said something

419
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:18,320
and hung up the phone.

420
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:21,360
Then tonight...

421
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:26,360
You guys go.

422
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:27,120
I'll pass.

423
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:28,000
I don't want to irritate her.

424
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:28,480
Sure.

425
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:29,240
No problem.

426
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:30,880
You should go home.

427
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:33,520
Bummer!

428
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:35,680
Wait a sec.

429
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:38,920
A little present.

430
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:39,720
Why?

431
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:41,960
I planned to give it to you at dinner.

432
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:43,520
Happy Birthday.

433
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:44,160
Oh wow.

434
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:45,160
Thank you, Mr. Du.

435
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:46,840
OK, go ahead.

436
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:49,720
You haven't signed it yet.

437
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:50,600
Right.

438
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:54,400
Let me see.

439
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:08,720
How come you have time to call me

440
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:10,840
at the rush hour of housewives?

441
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:13,600
I am homeless.

442
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:17,960
I want to find a place to rest.

443
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:20,160
What's happening?

444
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:21,120
Did you have a fight?

445
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:26,240
Yeah.

446
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:29,040
That's ok. Come to my place.

447
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:34,640
I don't want to meet anyone other than you.

448
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:40,200
I will send you an address.

449
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:41,360
You can go to my house.

450
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:42,920
Lie down wherever you like.

451
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:44,280
OK.

452
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:52,920
It can be seen in last year's financial statements

453
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:55,600
that their total assets 
in the import and export business,

454
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:56,760
compared to last year,

455
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:58,360
showed a negative growth rate

456
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:00,520
of up to 15%.

457
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:01,240
In addition,

458
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:02,200
due to the strengthening

459
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:04,680
of European import 
and export medical device control,

460
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:07,200
tariffs have been adjusted.

461
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:09,120
In this global context,

462
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:10,520
the companies that bid last year

463
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:12,680
are all experiencing capital shortages.

464
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:14,120
In this case,

465
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:15,640
we need to re-check

466
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:17,440
the financial report in detail.

467
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:18,160
Hello? Who is it?

468
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:20,880
I am Yuanyuan's teacher.

469
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:22,640
Ms. Zhang.

470
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:25,760
Yuanyuan's mother hasn't come yet.

471
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:27,640
I called her, but her phone turned off.

472
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:30,040
Please pick up your child right now.

473
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:33,000
Right, Ms. Zhang.

474
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:33,880
I'm on the way.

475
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:35,160
Be right there.

476
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:41,720
Yongjie, tell Mr. Lu that

477
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:42,720
I can't attend the meeting.

478
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:43,440
It's my children.

479
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:44,560
I have to go.

480
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:47,840
Yuanyuan, don't move. I'll pick up your brother.

481
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:53,360
Sorry.

482
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:56,120
Who is this person?

483
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:57,400
My dad.

484
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:58,920
Yes, I am his father.

485
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:00,480
I have never met you before,

486
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:01,720
so I have to make it clear

487
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:03,040
before letting you take him.

488
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:04,040
Of course.

489
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:04,560
I'm sorry.

490
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:05,240
I was too busy today.

491
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:06,520
His mother usually picks him up.

492
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:07,840
Sorry, daddy is late.

493
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,520
Sorry. Can you forgive me?

494
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:10,240
Hum.

495
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:12,040
Thank you.

496
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:12,720
Go.

497
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:14,440
Thank you.

498
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:19,240
Hurry up. Your sister is waiting for you in the car.

499
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:20,120
Here.

500
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:21,960
Zhuang.

501
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:31,040
Your mommy has really spoiled you.

502
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:32,200
You don't know how to change shoes.

503
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:36,440
Son.

504
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:37,600
You're fast.

505
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:38,800
I'll do it.

506
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:43,480
All right.

507
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:52,520
Daddy.

508
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:54,200
Didn't you say that

509
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:55,840
mommy is cooking at home today?

510
00:41:58,680 --> 00:41:59,240
Don't worry.

511
00:41:59,240 --> 00:41:59,960
Daddy will cook.

512
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:01,160
You'll be fed.

513
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:01,800
Yeah.

514
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:11,800
Tell me what you want to eat.

515
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:13,400
I want beef noodles.

516
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:14,760
I want curry rice.

517
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:17,120
I want creamy mushroom soup.

518
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:17,840
