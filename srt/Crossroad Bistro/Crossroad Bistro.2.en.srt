00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,640
We've prepared six cold dishes

5
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,240
and ten hot dishes.

6
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:08,479
Do you want them now?

7
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:09,919
Serve the cold dishes first.

8
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:10,919
We're waiting for someone.

9
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:12,320
The hot dishes can wait.

10
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:12,840
Okay.

11
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:14,920
Bao Xue.

12
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,920
She was in the play that we invested in.

13
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,000
She's got a great personality.

14
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Hello.

15
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:20,800
Xue.

16
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,200
I'm co-hosting this dinner with a business partner

17
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:23,720
of Mr. Chai.

18
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:25,440
It's been a long time since we last met,

19
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,079
so I invited you here.

20
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,560
She can certainly bring joy to the dinner.

21
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:30,680
Come in.

22
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,920
Allow me to introduce her.

23
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:34,640
This is my sister, Dai Xiaoyu.

24
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:35,560
She's free today,

25
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,720
so I'm taking her here for dinner.

26
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:40,120
This is Mr. Ge,

27
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,880
the investor of my last play.

28
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:43,720
Hello.

29
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:44,400
This is...

30
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,360
Chai.

31
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,120
Chai.

32
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:47,560
Mr. Chai.

33
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,160
Hello.

34
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,960
You've never told me

35
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,000
you have a sister.

36
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,640
She just came back from abroad.

37
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,840
You wouldn't be able to see her
 even if I had told you.

38
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,320
You two are...

39
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,600
Siblings?

40
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:59,160
Her dad is my uncle.

41
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,120
We look alike, don't we?

42
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,400
You are the most beautiful sisters

43
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,120
the world will ever see.

44
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,320
We don't know

45
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,560
about that.

46
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:10,320
Wait till we get married

47
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:11,680
and have daughters.

48
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12,560
Right.

49
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,120
You're so funny.

50
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,520
Shanshan's held up by work.

51
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,320
She'll be here later.

52
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,120
She asked us to start without her.

53
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,120
No way.

54
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,440
We must wait for her.

55
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:20,600
How about this?

56
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,840
Let's sit down and chat.

57
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:22,760
You're in charge of the seating.

58
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:25,640
We'll leave the center seat to Ms. You.

59
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:27,320
Chai, let's sit next to her.

60
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:27,560
Okay.

61
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,480
Xue, sit next to me.

62
00:03:29,079 --> 00:03:30,240
Xiaoyu, sit over here.

63
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:31,280
Okay.

64
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,160
Hello.

65
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:32,760
I'm Feng Xi.

66
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:33,280
I am Bao Xue.

67
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,880
She said that you came back from abroad.

68
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:35,760
Where abroad?

69
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:36,520
Norway.

70
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,280
What were you doing there? Study?

71
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,360
I was there for my bachelor's and master's degrees.

72
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:42,800
What do you do now?

73
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:45,120
I just came back. I haven't thought about it yet.

74
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,040
There's no hurry.

75
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:48,920
Do you mind if I add you on WeChat?

76
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:52,480
Do it.

77
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,079
Okay.

78
00:03:54,079 --> 00:03:54,800
I'll add you.

79
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:55,680
Okay.

80
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:57,680
Come on, Chai.

81
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:58,800
You said we must wait for her.

82
00:03:58,800 --> 00:03:59,920
And now you wanna start without her.

83
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,360
It's You Shanshan we're talking about.

84
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,080
Come on, we've been waiting for this long.

85
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:03,800
We can wait a while longer.

86
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:04,800
Who knows when she will...

87
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:05,240
Let's wait.

88
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,120
Mr. Ge.

89
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,080
Mr. Du.

90
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:09,960
I heard your voice when I was passing by.

91
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:11,400
What are you doing here?

92
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,080
I wanted to come over here and say hello.

93
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,960
Are you clairvoyant or what?

94
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:15,800
Yeah.

95
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:16,560
This is

96
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,600

98
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:21,279
our long-term business partner.

99
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:22,760
Nice to meet you.

100
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:23,480
Nice to meet you all.

101
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:28,600
Ms. You.

102
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,320
Tell the other waiters.

103
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,840
No one shall get the check other than me.

104
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:31,400
Okay.

105
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:33,720
Sorry, guys.

106
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,600
I got held up in the office.

107
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,440
Sorry.

108
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:40,080
This is the real host of the dinner tonight.

109
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,840
Ms. You Shanshan.

110
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:42,640
Ms. You.

111
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:44,440
This is my old friend, Mr. Du Shijun.

112
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,040
Nice to meet you, Ms. You.

113
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,600
Excuse me for one sec, Mr. Du.

114
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,280
I'm late. I need to punish myself.

115
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,120
What do you call this?

116
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,400
It's called "down in one."

117
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,560
Down in one!

118
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,360
Girl, I haven't seen you before.

119
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,600
Hello.

120

Such a beautiful lady.

121
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,480
Thanks.

122
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,360
Your wife?

123
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,280
Come on.

124
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,640
It's the first time I met her.

125
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,440
She's my sister.

126
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:10,120
Sorry.

127
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:12,240
But I'm sure about one thing.

128
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,640
He's added you on WeChat,

129
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:14,240
right?

130
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,120
-Yeah.
-Yes.

131
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:16,400
Come on.

132
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,120
Drink with me.

133
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,600
You're WeChat friends already.

134
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,400
Come on, drink!

135
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:21,880
Cheers.

136
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,960
Nice to meet you.

137
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:24,440
Nice to meet you.

138
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:25,160
Welcome, Ms. You.

139
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:25,920
Cheers.

140
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,720
Isn't Shanshan amazing?

141
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:34,320
Truly amazing.

142
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,840
Then, I'll leave you to enjoy dinner.

143
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:36,800
Have a good time.

144
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:37,120
Okay.

145
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:37,720
Great.

146
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:38,800
Bye-bye.

147
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:39,360
See you.

148
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:39,880
Okay.

149
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:40,680
Bye.

150
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:41,320
Take care, Mr. Du.

151
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:42,320
Bye-bye.

152
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:43,800
Try the food.

153
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:44,760
Waiter.

154
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,480
Serve the hot dishes.

155
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:47,600
Okay.

156
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,400
These two beautiful girls are...

157
00:05:51,159 --> 00:05:53,200
I had introduced them before you came.

158
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,320
This is my friend.

159
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:54,960
Bao Xue.

160
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:55,840
An actress.

161
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:56,480
This is her sister.

162
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,200
Xiaoyu.

163
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,159
Ms. Shanshan.

164
00:05:59,159 --> 00:06:01,640
Yu and Xue, meaning rain and snow.

165
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:02,800
Sounds chilling.

166
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:05,280
Then let's have a drink and get warm!

167
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:06,960
Great.

168
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,720
Shanshan, tell you what.

169
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:14,520
We'd already had a drink with Xiaoyu before you came.

170
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,520
From the moment she got here,

171
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:17,800
she's never missed a toast.

172
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,160
Look at her now.

173
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:21,080
She's so calm that I can't even hear her heartbeat.

174
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,840
Come on, Mr. Chai.

175
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,400
Her heart still needs a beat.

176
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,560
It needs to beat fast and strong.

177
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,360
Otherwise, we'd be drinking with a corpse.

178
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,520
You're right.

179
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:31,760
You are such a badass.

180
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,440
Here. I'll make a toast

181
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:36,600
to Ms. Shanshan, Mr. Chai, and Mr. Ge.

182
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:38,840
Sit down.

183
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,800
You can't toast to the three of us with just one drink

184
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,280
just because you're pretty.

185
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:46,760
Down in one!

186
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:48,920
Okay.

187
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:00,040
See?

188
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,000
Impressive.

189
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:01,920
Amazing, huh?

190
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,520
Yeah.

191
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,520
Are you born a great drinker

192
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,240
or did you practice to get this good?

193
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,840
I think it runs in the family.

194
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,360
My grandpa could drink a lot when he was alive.

195
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:14,680
He drank alcohol his whole life

196
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:16,040
without damaging his liver.

197
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,440
I think

198
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:20,440
he's got more ALDH in his body than others.

199
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,120
Do you need

200
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,920
one more shot of anesthetic than others in surgery?

201
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,920
One more is not enough.

202
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,680
I need general anesthesia even for a tooth removal.

203
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:29,960
See?

204
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:31,120
A group of

205
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:31,880
young people

206
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,800
with dreams and ambition.

207
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:34,680
The church looks good.

208
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:35,400
Right?

209
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,760
They think businessmen

210
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,159
are all under-educated.

211
00:07:40,159 --> 00:07:41,320
But let me tell you this.

212
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,640
Those who've made a fortune

213
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:46,120
can't be stupid.

214
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,240
What's that song again?

215
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,000
No one can become successful effortlessly.

216
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:53,840
You need to understand how important money is

217
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,080
so that you can save money.

218
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:56,000
Got it?

219
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:58,520
It doesn't matter if I got it.

220
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,120
I don't have money to save.

221
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,360
Then make some.

222
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:03,680
How?

223
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,080
Here is an opportunity for you right now.

224
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,640
I'm all ears.

225
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:09,640
Have dinner with me.

226
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,080
Don't take me wrong.

227
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:20,360
A large part of our business

228
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,320
is publicity.

229
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:24,160
A lot of contracts are signed on the dinner table.

230
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,400
Xiaoyu,

231
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,160
you're good-looking.

232
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:28,920
You're elegant.

233
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,440
You're well-educated.

234
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,080
These are your advantages.

235
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,520
Use them!

236
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:37,240
I don't know your business well.

237
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,720
You can learn!

238
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,600
As long as you know a little bit, you're good to go.

239
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:42,919
Okay.

240
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,880
I'll think about it, alright?

241
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:45,840
Understood?

242
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:46,800
Think it over.

243
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:47,880
No pressure at all.

244
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:48,600
Okay.

245
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,960
Shanshan said you two are from the same city.

246
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:51,520
Yeah.

247
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:52,560
Where are you from?

248
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:53,880
Jingzhou, Hubei.

249
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,320
Jingzhou, as in the Jin Province Liu Bei lost?

250
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:57,960
Yeah?

251
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:58,880
Yeah.

252
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,480
How long have you been in Beijing?

253
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:03,360
My boyfriend came here for his Ph.D.

254
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,720
So, I came here with him.

255
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,560
Should be three years now.

256
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,480
Three years?

257
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:11,000
Then he's graduated now, right?

258
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,080
He got offered a fellowship.

259
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:14,320
God!

260
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,360
A mega intellect!

261
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,680
How did you meet?

262
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:20,880
We were classmates in middle school.

263
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:23,080
He had good grades

264
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:25,240
and got into a university in the provincial capital.

265
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,280
I started to work after graduating from
 the vocational school.

266
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,960
He went to grad school
 after obtaining his bachelor's degree.

267
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:34,360
I used to get on the long-distance bus
 and visit him every month.

268
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,880
Then he started his Ph.D program and went to Beijing.

269
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,000
I thought to myself,

270
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,040
"It's more than 1,000 km."

271
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,600
So, I quit my job

272
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,880
and came here to be with him.

273
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,960
Luckily, a relative of mine is abroad,

274
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,240
so I can live in his apartment.

275
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,720
It's right next to my boyfriend's uni.

276
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,720
Do you live together?

277
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:52,560
No.

278
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:55,560
My pals who've been through this told me

279
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:56,560
not to live with him.

280
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:00,960
So, he lives in the company dorm.

281
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,320
He brings laundry to my place

282
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,920
every weekend

283
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,400
and I make a nice meal

284
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,680
for him.

285
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,600
Now that we're in the same city,

286
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,960
we can see each other all the time.

287
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,400
It's easier for both of us.

288
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,880
Don't you want to get married?

289
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:16,720
We do.

290
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:17,880
After he graduates.

291
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,240
What about you?

292
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,440
Got a boyfriend?

293
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,320
Me?

294
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:23,760
Well, I had a boyfriend.

295
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:27,600
Handsome gentlemen and beautiful ladies,

296
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,520
join me in horse-riding tomorrow.

297
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:31,920
What? Horse-riding?

298
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,640
Don't just drink.

299
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,880
You need to exercise.

300
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:38,880
I can't go.

301
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,280
I've got a meeting tomorrow.

302
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:41,040
I can't, either.

303
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,440
I'm going to play golf tomorrow.

304
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,440
Bummer.

305
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,640
How about you three?

306
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:47,680
Count me out.

307
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:48,840
Physical exercises scare me.

308
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,200
Just let me sleep in.

309
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:52,200
You?

310
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,560
I am free.

311
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:53,880
But...

312
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:55,440
But what? You're going.

313
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,160
You?

314
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,600
I can go.

315
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,200
I am not as lazy as my sister.

316
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,520
Okay!

317
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:01,480
That's a deal.

318
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:02,240
Okay.

319
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:07,560
Bao Xue.

320
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,960
Where did you graduate?

321
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,280
The Central Academy of Drama.

322
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,480
Great school.

323
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,360
I heard that there are three systems in acting.

324
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:16,080
Stanislavski's system,

325
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:16,760
Brecht's system,

326
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,520
and the system created by Mei Lanfang.

327
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,200
I don't know about the first two.

328
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:21,000
But I think

329
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,720
Mei Lanfang's system must be the greatest one.

330
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,040
Which system do you use?

331
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,520
I use the system of Mei Lanfang's brother,

332
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:27,440
Mei Lanzhu.

333
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,880
Mei Lanzhu?

334
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,840
Does Mei Lanfang even have a brother?

335
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:33,080
I've never heard of him.

336
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,200
Don't listen to her.

337
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,160
It's not so much Mei Lanzhu

338
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:36,760
as she's making a joke.

339
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:38,720
I'm not making a joke.

340
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:41,000
I'm just making fun of myself, Shanshan.

341
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,240
I've graduated for three years

342
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,160
and still am an extra

343
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,800
on different sets.

344
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,960
I think you're so funny.

345
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,360
You should try comedy.

346
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,120
You don't understand.

347
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,760
The core of every comedy is a tragedy.

348
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,240
Just look at those legendary comedians.

349
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:57,240
Deep down inside, they are

350
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:59,480
very sensitive, fragile, and depressed.

351
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:00,520
People like me

352
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:01,600
that are optimistic

353
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,520
and can get over anything

354
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:05,120
are perfect for tragedies.

355
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,240
Because however tragic the story is,

356
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:09,160
I can make sure to break character afterward.

357
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,640
You know yourself quite well.

358
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:12,480
So, people like you

359
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,160
who don't take things seriously

360
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:15,440
are fundamentally

361
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,080
very confident, right?

362
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:22,000
Way to talk me up, Shanshan!

363
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,080
Feels great.

364
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:25,680
Shanshan.

365
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:26,800
All jokes aside,

366
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,880
if I can't even get a part as an extra,

367
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:29,840
I'll work for you.

368
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,560
Ma'am.

369
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,440
Do you own this jockey club?

370
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:45,920
How could I?

371
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,360
I'm just a member here.

372
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:49,560
Shanshan.

373
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,240
Seriously, I'll work for you from now on.

374
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:53,320
You don't even know what I do for a living,

375
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,840
and you're already applying to work for me?

376
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,000
Aren't you afraid I'll kidnap you?

377
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,480
Kidnap me?

378
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,920
I'm a nobody.

379
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:00,920
Even a kidnaper

380
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:01,920
would let me go.

381
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,400
He'd keep my clothes maybe.

382
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:05,040
Don't worry.

383
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,400
I won't kidnap you.

384
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:08,160
But maybe I'll eat you alive!

385
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,760
You've got a big appetite, Shanshan.

386
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:12,120
Trying to eat me alive?

387
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:12,880
Shanshan.

388
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:14,680
Bin.

389
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:16,120
I rarely see you here.

390
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,440
It's been long since you came here.

391
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,680
I've called you many times

392
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:20,600
asking you out for dinner

393
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:21,600
and you rejected me.

394
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,200
Turns out you're hiding here trying to avoid me.

395
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,040
I wasn't avoiding you.

396
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:26,520
Let's have lunch together

397
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:27,200
and we can talk.

398
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:27,880
Okay.

399
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:35,600
See?

400
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:37,120
That girl looks so cool

401
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,640
on the horse.

402
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,120
Will we look like her later?

403
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:41,760
No way.

404
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:46,320
Don't you have any faith in me?

405
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:49,080
Now, I'll take you to have a look at the horses here.

406
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,680
Find me a steady one.

407
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,440
I don't wanna fall down.

408
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,200
Don't worry.

409
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,480
I've arranged a coach for you.

410
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:56,720
You won't fall.

411
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:57,720
Tell you what.

412
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:59,320
Horses understand humans well.

413
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:01,080
But, they're also bullies.

414
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,680
The minute you stand in front of them

415
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:03,720
and they can sense

416
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:05,440
if you know how to ride.

417
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,920
Really, Shanshan?

418
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:10,320
How do equestrians walk?

419
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,320
I'll learn their walks

420
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:12,760
and see if I can trick the horse.

421
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:15,920
This is mine.

422
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:18,120
Its dad was the champion in the Dressage World Cup.

423
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:20,320
Its mom was the champion in the European Pageant.

424
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,440
A royal!

425
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,480
What is it called?

426
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:25,560
Cigar.

427
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:27,800
Miss me?

428
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,080
Cigar.

429
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:33,040
Shanshan.

430
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:33,920
Does it bite?

431
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,360
I wanna touch it.

432
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,440
Try it.

433
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:38,600
Cigar.

434
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:45,160
One, two, three.

435
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:47,600
Fair ladies,

436
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:48,640
can you do me a favor?

437
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:51,000
We're shooting an ad here.

438
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,520
Can you help me

439
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,520
do a scene as extras?

440
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:55,720
It's your lucky day.

441
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:56,320
She is

442
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,720
a professional extra.

443
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:01,800
Bao Xue?

444
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,720
Liu Liangzhou!

445
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:04,400
What a coincidence!

446
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,600
What brings you here?

447
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:07,600
You know each other?

448
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,040
Let me introduce him.

449
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:11,040
He's the photographer of my last play.

450
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,200
Liu Liangzhou.

451
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:14,800
You know how to choose a set.

452
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,000
What are you shooting?

453
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:16,920
An ad.

454
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:18,080
War Horse

455
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,080
functional beverage.

456
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,120
Jade is here, too.

457
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:25,880
She is?

458
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:27,760
Great.

459
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:28,640
Great.

460
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:30,200
They'll help you

461
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:30,720
with makeup.

462
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,080
Okay.

463
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:33,400
I can't go with you.

464
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,760
I've got a thing later.

465
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:35,920
I can't shoot the ad with you.

466
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,080
Practice before shooting.

467
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:37,880
Careful.

468
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:38,920
Okay.

469
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:40,480
Feng Xi, let's go.

470
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:41,480
Lead the way!

471
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,320
Jade!

472
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,960
I've got two extras for you.

473
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:45,760
Look who it is.

474
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:50,760
What are the odds!

475
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:51,760
How come you are here!

476
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:53,040
Where did you find her?

477
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,360
Jade, I miss you so much!

478
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,080
How's study?

479
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,000
Good.

480
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:00,880
You can't prioritize horse-riding

481
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,440
over study.

482
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:03,200
Bin.

483
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:06,800
How's business going?

484
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:08,880
Not good.

485
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:11,200
Tianyi.

486
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,560
Let me have a word with Ms. Shanshan.

487
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:13,120
Okay.

488
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:18,680
Shanshan.

489
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:19,920
I'm so sorry.

490
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,360
I'm having people keep an eye on the money.

491
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,640
Once it's in,

492
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:26,520
I'll pay you up immediately.

493
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:28,560
Bin, I'm not here to rush you.

494
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:33,160
Give me some time.

495
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,120
Tomorrow,

496
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,040
I'll pay some of the interest.

497
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,040
Bin,

498
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:39,880
we're friends.

499
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:42,000
I got into this business because of you.

500
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,120
You don't need to pay interest.

501
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:44,720
Just give the principal back

502
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:45,840
when the cash flow is normal.

503
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:49,920
Shanshan.

504
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:50,960
Thanks.

505
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,079
Granny.

506
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,359
Sis.

507
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:20,480
You're back!

508
00:17:21,079 --> 00:17:22,400
Granny, where is Xiaoyu?

509
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:24,200
She's out.

510
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:26,720
She said she wanted to check on this company.

511
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,440
I'm exhausted.

512
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:46,160
Great.

513
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:48,720
Were you doing heavy-lifting?

514
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:52,600
I went to a spontaneous horse-riding
 with two friends.

515
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:53,520
I can't feel

516
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,160
my back and my hips anymore.

517
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:56,920
Granny, can you give me a massage?

518
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:00,720
I used to cycle to the mountains

519
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:03,800
and get spring water in my 50s.

520
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:06,040
I can't compete with you.

521
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:06,840
You were

522
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:09,240
nurtured by the love of my grandpa.

523
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:11,720
Who's stopping you to find love?

524
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,680
Finding love is way tiring than horse-riding.

525
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:16,080
If I get dumped, I'll need over a month to recover.

526
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,120
No, thanks.

527
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,440
You were asking for it.

528
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,560
I met a bad guy.

529
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:22,000
Okay?

530
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:24,960
Granny,

531
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:27,000
can you make me noodles?

532
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:27,720
After I'm full,

533
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:28,640
I'll set up a trap

534
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,400
and catch a boyfriend for you.

535
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,440
For me?

536
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:33,520
Don't bother.

537
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:36,320
You're the best!

538
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,040
Don't lean on the fridge.

539
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:49,600
Look at yourself.

540
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:51,920
Granny,

541
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:53,320
I heard you singing along the piano

542
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:55,920
when I was coming in.

543
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,240
Your voice

544
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:58,400
was so pure.

545
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,480
You don't sound like someone in their 70s at all.

546
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,680
I was a voice major in a normal school, after all.

547
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,560
I didn't have all the soup

548
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:06,920
in my school for nothing.

549
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:10,960
The old saying was referring to rice.

550
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,200
How come it's soup with you?

551
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:15,000
Back then, we didn't have sufficient food.

552
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:17,240
I left

553
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:18,720
all the food coupons to your grandpa.

554
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,760
Soup was free.

555
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:23,840
I get it.

556
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:26,400
You were trying to use food coupons

557
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,600
in exchange for

558
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,480
the love and obedience of my grandpa.

559
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,520
You're quite a visionary!

560
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,160
Don't try to sweet-talk me.

561
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,880
If he had really listened to me,

562
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:39,120
I wouldn't have lived such a hard life.

563
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:41,280
Your life is hard?

564
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:43,520
I think you are just too greedy.

565
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:46,000
When my grandpa was with you,

566
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,080
he didn't dare to

567
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:50,440
disagree with a single word

568
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:51,840
you said.

569
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,480
What more do you want?

570
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:56,640
He didn't disagree with me verbally.

571
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:59,080
But he kept giving away stuff.

572
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:00,160
If it were not for me,

573
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,280
he'd already

574
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,720
given away all the family fortune.

575
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:09,360
Your mom went to Shenzhen for a job after graduation.

576
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:12,600
She moved back to Beijing when she was having you.

577
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,120
I was there to take care of her.

578
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:16,760
She wanted to go back to Shenzhen

579
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:18,320
after her maternity leave.

580
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:20,040
I was worried about you two,

581
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:22,520
so I asked her to leave you here

582
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,880
so that I could take care of you with your grandpa.

583
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,080
Your uncle thought

584
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,880
your mother was taking advantage.

585
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:31,120
So,

586
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,240
he sent Xiaoyu

587
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,440
to a childcare center in Beijing right away.

588
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:36,560
Your grandpa said to me,

589
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:37,640
"We shall not

590
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:40,000
play favorites.

591
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,280
It's good to

592
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:43,520
have two granddaughters with us.

593
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:47,000
This way, life after retirement won't be so lonely.

594
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,120
And they can

595
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:49,360
keep each other company."

596
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:51,000
Before I even said anything,

597
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
he had already opened his arms

598
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,560
to welcome Xiaoyu.

599
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:56,600
You call this obedience?

600
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:58,040
I was so angry.

601
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:00,840
So,

602
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:04,080
you raised both me and my sis.

603
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,280
Yeah.

604
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:08,000
I gave you the same food

605
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,400
and provided you with
 the same environment.

606
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,560
But you two

607
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:13,440
have turned into totally different people.

608
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:15,640
As they say, the apple

609
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:16,800
doesn't fall far from the tree.

610
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:19,880
You and your parents are kind and honest.

611
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:22,080
Your uncle

612
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,040
and his wife

613
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:26,560
only think about themselves.

614
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:28,720
Granny.

615
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:30,680
Why did you

616
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,480
and my uncle...

617
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:34,840
Can we not talk about him?

618
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:36,800
Back when I was little, you wouldn't tell me

619
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,360
because I wouldn't understand.

620
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:39,320
Now that I'm an adult,

621
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:41,040
at least tell me some of it.

622
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:42,400
If you know too much,

623
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,040
it'll become a burden.

624
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:47,200
It is a burden that I keep wondering about it.

625
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:47,960
For all these years,

626
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:49,600
you always get upset

627
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,480
when I mention my uncle and his wife.

628
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:53,680
What happened between you?

629
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:55,440
I don't wanna talk about them.

630
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:57,680
Come on!

631
00:21:58,560 --> 00:21:59,960
Just tell me!

632
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,880
If you don't tell me,

633
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:02,960
I'll crash this egg

634
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,520
on my head.

635
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:05,520
The neighbors

636
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:06,440
will then say that

637
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:07,720
an old lady here

638
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:08,680
used an egg

639
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:10,680
to force her own granddaughter to kill herself.

640
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:11,360
Are you telling me or not?

641
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:12,400
I'll crash it.

642
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,320
I'm doing it.

643
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:14,520
Stop it.

644
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:15,960
Put it down.

645
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,560
Who are you trying to threaten?

646
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:19,240
Will you tell me?

647
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:20,400
A lot of things happened.

648
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,560
Which one do you want to know?

649
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:23,480
Let's start with what happened
 when grandpa was still alive.

650
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:29,840
I'm falling apart.

651
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:33,440
I'm hungry. What do you want for dinner?

652
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,080
Let's order in.

653
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:39,080
My legs hurt.

654
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:44,520
You should

655
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:46,080
stay away from Yuan Shanshan.

656
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,640
Look who she's with all day.

657
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,000
They're all old perverts.

658
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:52,760
They say they take you for outdoor activities

659
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:54,400
because they're good for health.

660
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,480
But the truth is that

661
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:56,840
their minds are dirty.

662
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:00,840
I think you're the one with a dirty mind.

663
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:02,080
I don't wanna argue with you.

664
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,400
My shoulders hurt.

665
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:06,320
Your shoulders?

666
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:08,720
I thought your legs hurt.

667
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,360
My shoulders hurt because of your words.

668
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:13,560
I'm calling You Shanshan now

669
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:16,040
and ask her to go to those dinners by herself

670
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:17,320
and leave you alone.

671
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:21,040
I'm back here once a week

672
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:22,360
and you're lying there like a corpse.

673
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:23,600
Then why do I even come back?

674
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:25,680
Call her, call her now.

675
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:27,000
You've got her number, right?

676
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,560
Call her if you're not afraid of her yelling at you.

677
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:29,840
Fine.

678
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:31,800
I'm just being sensible.

679
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:32,680
Why would she yell at me?

680
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:33,680
I'll call her now.

681
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:40,280
Hello?

682
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:41,280
You Shanshan.

683
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:42,840
This is Li Xiang.

684
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,080
Yes?

685
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:44,880
Well...

686
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:46,720
I'll just be blunt here.

687
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:48,360
Please, don't

688
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:49,160
ever

689
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:50,280
take my girlfriend

690
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:51,560
out to your dinners.

691
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:52,240
Alright?

692
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:54,720
I don't care if you want to help her

693
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:56,520
or think of her as a friend.

694
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:58,160
It has now seriously affected

695
00:23:58,160 --> 00:23:59,280
our relationship.

696
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:02,800
If you've got anything against us,

697
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:04,000
let's talk.

698
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,840
If you've got anything against me,

699
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:07,200
we can talk, too.

700
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,480
Stop bothering us like this.

701
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:10,160
Okay?

702
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:12,240
Alright, Li Xiang.

703
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:14,240
Are you done?

704
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:15,880
I took her out

705
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:17,920
because I wanted her to see the world

706
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:20,880
and add more excitement to her dull life.

707
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:23,240
I wasn't pushing her toward any other men.

708
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:25,400
What else shall she do?

709
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:27,920
Wait for you at home 24/7

710
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:29,240
and look after you?

711
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:30,720
What do you think she is?

712
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,320
Your girlfriend, or your mom?

713
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:34,680
You can't be so selfish, got it?

714
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:36,880
You started whining the minute I picked up the phone.

715
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:38,200
Let me ask you a question.

716
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:39,840
Are you there?

717
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:40,640
What?

718
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:41,720
Who's the man here, you or me?

719
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:29,680
You got yelled at, right?

720
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:34,320
She's born unreasonable.

721
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:36,000
I was just being a bigger man.

722
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:39,600
Come on.

723
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,160
I won't go out with her anymore, okay?

724
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:41,800
Okay.

725
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:43,960
What's for dinner?

726
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:45,040
I'll order in.

727
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:47,240
I've eaten at the college cafe for a week.

728
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:49,000
I want to eat something you make.

729
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:54,000
Then, give me a massage.

730
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:56,960
You're amazing.

731
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,400
Feels good.

732
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:06,400
You should've done this sooner.

733
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,320
You just had to call her.

734
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:09,800
Since the dawn of time,

735
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:11,360
intellects have never once

736
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:14,440
won an argument with unreasonable broads.

737
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:16,920
Then why did you even bother?

738
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:23,040
It all goes back to a decade ago.

739
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,160
We got a sum of money

740
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:27,000
from the demolition of our old house.

741
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:29,680
Then, you bought this house, right?

742
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:31,080
Yeah.

743
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:32,080
But back then,

744
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:33,720
we hadn't got the money.

745
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,920
Once your uncle heard about the news,

746
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:39,200
he got back here

747
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,440
from Hangzhou immediately

748
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:44,160
and started to do all the housework.

749
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:45,680
Cooking, buying groceries,

750
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:48,000
looking after us, and all that.

751
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,440
I sensed there was something wrong.

752
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:52,560
Just have a look with mom.

753
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:54,040
You'll sleep in the east bedroom.

754
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:55,640
Mom.

755
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:56,800
You haven't been back for long.

756
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:58,320
So I've put the beddings away.

757
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:00,440
Mom, you don't have to do this.

758
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:01,880
I can do it myself.

759
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:02,480
Sit here.

760
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:03,560
Come on.

761
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:05,360
Mom.

762
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:06,960
I'll make you some tea.

763
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,120
No need.

764
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:09,520
I'll share the cup with her.

765
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:12,680
Is there anything you want to tell us?

766
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:13,920
Mom.

767
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:15,280
What thing?

768
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:17,480
I'm just here to see you.

769
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:19,720
Say it.

770
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:21,920
Dad.

771
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:22,760
Then I'll talk.

772
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:25,920
Mom.

773
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:28,040
Now that

774
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:30,680
you two are getting older,

775
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:34,160
and this house

776
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:35,880
is being demolished soon,

777
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:37,000
I don't think

778
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,440
you two should

779
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:39,400
rush yourselves

780
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:41,520
into buying a new house.

781
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:43,520
I've got a proposal.

782
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:45,720
I want to buy a new apartment in Hangzhou.

783
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:48,080
I think you two

784
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,120
can come to Hangzhou.

785
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,000
Besides,

786
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,400
we can put the money

787
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:52,280
together

788
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:53,840
and buy a bigger house.

789
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:58,080
I knew you must be up to something.

790
00:27:58,840 --> 00:27:59,520
Mom.

791
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:00,720
I wasn't up to anything.

792
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,400
This is good for us.

793
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:03,880
The weather in the south is more accommodating.

794
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:04,280
Yeah.

795
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:04,960
I like it there.

796
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:06,920
It's too dry

797
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:07,680
in Beijing.

798
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:08,520
Yeah.

799
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:09,840
Houjiang,

800
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:11,760
how big of a house do you wanna buy?

801
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,480
Have you seen any houses yet?

802
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:15,240
I haven't thought about how big of a house I wanna buy.

803
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:16,080
But

804
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:17,600
it's close to the West Lake.

805
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:19,520
I don't agree.

806
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:22,720
Moving at our age

807
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:23,800
can be detrimental.

808
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:26,520
Me and your dad, we're old.

809
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,240
Why would we leave our home?

810
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:31,480
Mom.

811
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:33,880
What do you mean, leave your home?

812
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:35,520
When you move to Hangzhou,

813
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:37,000
that place will be your home.

814
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:39,840
I've lived here all my life.

815
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:43,040
I won't adjust to the new life in the south.

816
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:45,160
I'm not going.

817
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:48,120
If your dad wants to go,

818
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:49,440
take him with you.

819
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:52,080
I'll just find a community

820
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:53,880
near the hospital

821
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:55,240
and buy a house big enough

822
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:57,360
for the two of us to live.

823
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:02,160
What do you say

824
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:03,160
we buy a house

825
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,800
farther away from the city center

826
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:05,880
and save money

827
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:07,080
for Houjiang to buy a big one?

828
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:08,200
Dad.

829
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:09,440
Farther away?

830
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:11,120
How far?

831
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:13,480
Houses beyond the 5th ring are cheaper.

832
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:14,880
But can we move there?

833
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:17,040
If we're not well and want to go to the hospital,

834
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:18,200
it'd be so troublesome.

835
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:19,800
If you ask me,

836
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:22,440
I think you should buy

837
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:23,640
what you can afford.

838
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:25,040
It's just the three of you.

839
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:27,000
Why do you need a big house?

840
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,280
Buy a small one for now.

841
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:30,040
When you get rich,

842
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:32,200
you can buy the whole West Lake

843
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:33,800
if you can afford it.

844
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,400
I won't take advantage of you.

845
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:38,560
Stop eyeing our life savings

846
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:39,400
all day.

847
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:41,400
Mom.

848
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:44,120
I was just making a proposal.

849
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:46,000
We don't have to do it if you don't agree.

850
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,400
Why do you have to be so mean about it?

851
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:50,000
Anyway, I won't go anywhere.

852
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:52,920
You can all

853
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:54,880
forget about the demolition settlement.

854
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:56,800
We'll use it to buy a house.

855
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:58,640
It's settled.

856
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:01,000
Don't try to sway me.

857
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:03,480
Go to bed.

858
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:05,480
You need to go back tomorrow.

859
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,040
He's just being considerate.

860
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,480
Some kids

861
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:31,400
want to buy their parents a bigger house.

862
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:33,600
But he wants to use our money

863
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:35,400
to buy himself a big house.

864
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:36,880
You call that considerate?

865
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:41,320
You've always been clever.

866
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,520
But when it comes to our son,

867
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:46,840
you become stupid immediately.

868
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:48,880
I am getting older.

869
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:52,600
I can't allow myself to be homeless in my last years.

870
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:55,280
How's that possible?

871
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,440
If we pay for the house,

872
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:01,080
then it will be our home, right?

873
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:03,880
Two families living under the same roof.

874
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:05,800
Who'll be in charge?

875
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:07,880
Me, or Zhu Min?

876
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:10,000
We're family.

877
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,280
Whoever makes the right decision
 should be in charge.

878
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:17,160
Those are the most useless words in the world.

879
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:18,560
How do you define "right?"

880
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:20,720
Everyone has their reasons.

881
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:23,520
How will you decide

882
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:24,840
who's right?

883
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:27,200
You old thing,

884
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,640
you're so bossy-boots.

885
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:31,080
You were so harsh

886
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:32,800
on him just now.

887
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:35,640
He must be heartbroken hearing all that.

888
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:37,320
That's none of my business.

889
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:39,800
I've raised him from a kid.

890
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:41,200
My conscience is clear.

891
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:48,760
Then, we bought this house.

892
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:51,240
And your uncle stopped bothering us for a while.

893
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:54,280
6 months later,

894
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:57,960
when we had just finished decorating

895
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:01,000
and wanted to sit back and relax,

896
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,280
trouble found us again.

897
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:03,520
My uncle came back?

898
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:04,480
No.

899
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:05,800
He was afraid to see me.

900
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:09,640
He called your grandpa in secret.

901
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:12,000
Houjiang called today.

902
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:13,520
I know.

903
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,400
I need to discuss something with you.

904
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:18,920
A good thing or a bad thing?

905
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:20,160
A good thing.

906
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:22,640
Xiaoyu is going to study in Europe.

907
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:25,120
A good thing, indeed.

908
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:26,720
She has two options.

909
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:29,040
She can either go to this uni in the UK

910
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:30,640
that only offers a partial scholarship.

911
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:33,840
But, the cost of living will be lower.

912
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:36,720
Or she can go to this uni in Norway

913
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,160
with full scholarship

914
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:40,760
and high cost of living.

915
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:44,920
This is the first one to study abroad in our family.

916
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:47,040
What do you want to do?

917
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:49,520
Hear me out.

918
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:51,280
She'll be gone for a year.

919
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:53,400
It'll cost less than 200k

920
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:55,480
for tuition and living expenses.

921
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:57,520
I don't think it's too much.

922
00:32:57,520 --> 00:32:58,320
Not much.

923
00:32:58,920 --> 00:32:59,880
Not little, either.

924
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:02,000
He can send her there if he can afford it.

925
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:05,600
They just bought a house, though.

926
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:07,800
We also just bought a house.

927
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:09,360
We can't afford to fund them.

928
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:11,040
But we still have

929
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:13,000
1 million yuan in the checking account.

930
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:13,800
Stop.

931
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,800
Dai Wangxi, listen to me.

932
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:20,840
I only pay for the tuition fee of our children.

933
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:23,280
I paid for Houjiang's undergraduate study

934
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:24,240
and Chengcheng's

935
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:25,400
postgraduate study.

936
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:26,400
That's it.

937
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:29,600
I've done my part.

938
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,480
Stop trying to

939
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:34,280
shoulder others' responsibility.

940
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:39,160
Forget about

941
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:40,400
the money in the checking account.

942
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:45,000
I remember the day of my grandpa's cremation.

943
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,960
I went to school that afternoon.

944
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:49,320
I saw my mom crying when I got back.

945
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:52,040
I kept asking her what happened,
 but she wouldn't tell me anything.

946
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:54,680
It was my dad that told me what happened.

947
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,200
He said that

948
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,720
my uncle got into an argument with you.

949
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:00,480
The day your grandpa died,

950
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:03,720
your uncle called me out

951
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:05,800
at the family funeral hall.

952
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:11,679
Mom.

953
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:14,600
Your lips are so dry that they're chapped.

954
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:16,159
Have some water.

955
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:27,400
Mom.

956
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:30,080
What's your plan for the future?

957
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:32,560
I'll just try to get by every day.

958
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:35,040
I've got no plan.

959
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:38,440
You've been taking care of my dad for so many years.

960
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:41,440
Now that he's gone,

961
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:44,800
and you're getting older,

962
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:46,520
how about

963
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:48,080
you come with me to Hangzhou?

964
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:51,120
I'm fine here.

965
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,760
I'll add to your plate if I live with you.

966
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,080
Don't say that.

967
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:56,440
It's our duty

968
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:58,280
to take care of you when you're old.

969
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:05,200
You guys are already under pressure,

970
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:07,160
supporting Xiaoyu's study abroad.

971
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:07,960
Mom.

972
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:09,040
My brother's under pressure.

973
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:10,320
I'm not.

974
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:11,520
How about you

975
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:13,320
live with me in Shenzhen for a while?

976
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:15,640
You can come back whenever you want to.

977
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:16,280
Chengcheng.

978
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:17,520
I think

979
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:18,960
mom should live with me.

980
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:19,920
I won't go anywhere.

981
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:23,480
Come back and visit me

982
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:25,720
if you miss me.

983
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:28,000
Why are you so stubborn?

984
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:29,960
You're

985
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:32,280
welcome to either of our houses.

986
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:33,560
Think about it.

987
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:34,760
You're already old.

988
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:36,440
It'll be too much work for you

989
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:38,560
to take care of a house this big.

990
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:47,800
Just say it.

991
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:50,120
What do you want?

992
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:57,840
Mom.

993
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:00,160
Here's the thing.

994
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:02,560
I do need a small favor.

995
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:04,600
But to be clear,

996
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:07,120
I won't take advantage of you.

997
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:09,480
I am

998
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:11,080
running a business.

999
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:12,280
I need money.

1000
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:14,160
I

1001
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:16,040
was planning to take out 
a loan on my house in Hangzhou.

1002
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:17,200
But that wasn't enough.

1003
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:19,040
Do you think

1004
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:21,160
you can

1005
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:23,160
lend me some money?

1006
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:25,800
Maybe we can take out a loan on this house

1007
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:28,840
and I will

1008
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:31,040
pay you back with interest.

1009
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:34,280
I knew it.

1010
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:36,680
You're up to something.

1011
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:39,800
Your father just died,

1012
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:42,080
and you're already after the house.

1013
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,240
Where do you want me to go?

1014
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:45,320
Come on.

1015
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:46,800
It's just a mortgage.

1016
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:47,680
We're not selling it.

1017
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:48,840
You'll still own it.

1018
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:50,360
What if your business fails?

1019
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:53,800
I'll sell the house in Hangzhou

1020
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:54,360
and pay you back.

1021
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:55,800
You just said

1022
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:57,520
the house in Hangzhou

1023
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:58,760
is not worth this much.

1024
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:01,840
Well...

1025
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:03,360
The price will go up in years.

1026
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:05,320
You are

1027
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:08,200
always thinking about

1028
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:10,680
your self-interest.

1029
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:12,760
When your dad was alive,

1030
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:15,400
his savings before retirement

1031
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:17,360
and his property after retirement,

1032
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:20,520
you wanted them all.

1033
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:22,320
But did you give me any of those?

1034
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:24,080
I was wise not to give them to you.

1035
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:25,440
Do I owe you?

1036
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:27,880
I'll say this upfront.

1037
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:29,800
As long as I am alive,

1038
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:31,880
I will be in charge of this house.

1039
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:32,640
Mom.

1040
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:34,520
You only ask us to do things for you,

1041
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:36,280
but you never do things for us.

1042
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:38,160
Other parents

1043
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:39,560
try their best

1044
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:40,680
to help their kids.

1045
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:41,680
And you?

1046
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:44,240
Well, I've said enough.

1047
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:45,280
Don't worry.

1048
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:46,240
I will

1049
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:47,960
pay you back in the future.

1050
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:50,040
Do I need to be

1051
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:52,480
sucked dry

1052
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:55,320
to prove that I am a good mother?

1053
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:56,240
Mom.

1054
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:58,040
Take a break, okay?

1055
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:00,160
Have I done you any wrong?

1056
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:02,640
Have I ever starved you?

1057
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:04,600
Have I ever kept you from good education?

1058
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:05,240
There are things

1059
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:07,680
other than food and education.

1060
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:08,920
You ask us for money to do business,

1061
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:10,960
support your kid,

1062
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:12,760
and buy a house.

1063
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:14,000
What more do you want?

1064
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:14,680
Mom.

1065
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:16,400
Even crows feed their parents.

1066
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:19,720
You're a father now.

1067
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:20,720
How will you be a role model

1068
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:22,520
to Xiaoyu if you keep acting like this?

1069
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:23,800
I want to look after you in your final years.

1070
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:26,080
Doesn't that count as repaying you?

1071
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:27,520
You want to sell my house

1072
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:30,440
and get the money to look after me

1073
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:32,560
and support your whole family.

1074
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:35,120
You and your wife are strong and capable.

1075
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:36,320
You're healthy human beings.

1076
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:38,960
And yet you're asking me, a 70-year-old, for money?

1077
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:40,320
Don't you feel guilty?

1078
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:41,640
I told you.

1079
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:43,600
I'm just putting your house on mortgage.

1080
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:47,120
If you don't believe me,

1081
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:47,720
how about this?

1082
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,120
We can

1083
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:55,320
write it down

1084
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:56,400
and sign an agreement, okay?

1085
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:57,760
I'm not signing anything.

1086
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:00,200
What if you show it to others

1087
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:02,120
and accuse me of being insensitive?

1088
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:03,400
I'll be the bad guy in others' eyes.

1089
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:05,920
How come you just can't understand me?

1090
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:08,280
No mother is like you.

1091
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:10,360
Guarding against your own child as if I'm a thief.

1092
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:11,640
If other mothers are good enough,

1093
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:12,840
you can be their son.

1094
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:16,360
You should think before you speak.

1095
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:18,480
If you're ever ill,

1096
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:20,280
you'll have to rely on us, won't you?

1097
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:21,560
Rely on you?

1098
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:23,640
I dare not dream of it.

1099
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:27,240
Among all the 200 bones in my body,

1100
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:29,040
there's still a backbone.

1101
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:31,520
Dai Houjiang.

1102
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:35,080
You're my son, after all.

1103
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:39,160
I gave birth to you, and I raised you.

1104
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:42,960
But now,

1105
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:44,680
you're treating me as an enemy.

1106
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:46,200
Great.

1107
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:48,200
Great!

1108
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:51,800
From now on,

1109
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:54,520
let's cut all connections.

1110
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:56,480
I am not your mother.

1111
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:58,800
And you are not my son.

1112
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:00,320
If you insist,

1113
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:02,760
I won't try to talk you out of it.

1114
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:06,600
In the future,

1115
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:09,520
if anything happens, don't come to me.

1116
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:11,600
Go to Chengcheng instead.

1117
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:16,080
Get out of here.

1118
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:19,000
Get out!

1119
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:20,160
Mom.

1120
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:20,880
You...

1121
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:21,560
Okay.

1122
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:23,160
I'll leave.

1123
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:27,520
Stay out of this.

1124
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:28,880
It doesn't concern you.

1125
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:49,840
Don't be angry,

1126
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:51,040
granny.

1127
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:53,160
I've not spoken to your uncle

1128
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:55,200
for ten whole years already.

1129
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:57,960
Tell me.

1130
00:40:59,040 --> 00:40:59,880
We, as parents,

1131
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:02,920
have put so much effort into raising a kid.

1132
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:04,320
And this is what we get.

1133
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:06,520
Did I do anything wrong?

1134
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:08,480
Of course, not.

1135
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:10,440
But I've gotta say something.

1136
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:12,160
Do bear with me.

1137
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:13,960
If my uncle

1138
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:16,040
comes to you for a favor,

1139
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:17,360
will you help him?

1140
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:18,160
No.

1141
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:23,520
If he comes to apologize to me,

1142
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:25,720
I'll forgive him.

1143
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:27,280
But again,

1144
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:29,840
if he's hungry, I'll prepare all the food he needs.

1145
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:31,680
But if he wants money, I won't give him any.

1146
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:33,520
I've done my job as a mother.

1147
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:35,600
See?

1148
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:37,320
You two are the same.

1149
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:39,320
No one is willing to back down.

1150
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:40,520
You're waiting for him to apologize.

1151
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:42,120
He's waiting for you to call him.

1152
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:43,360
Call him?

1153
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:45,040
It should be the other way around.

1154
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:48,000
Did I give birth to him, or he me?

1155
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:49,400
Granny.

1156
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:52,840
You can't play the seniority card.

1157
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:54,560
If I didn't play that card,

1158
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:58,320
can you even sit here in this house,
 worried about nothing?

1159
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:01,560
I get it.

1160
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:03,880
You kept asking when I wouldn't tell you.

1161
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:04,720
Now that I told you,

1162
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:06,440
how come you're on their side?

1163
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:07,960
Who's on their side?

1164
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:08,920
You are!

1165
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:09,680
I am not.

1166
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:12,840
I will always be on your side.

1167
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:16,200
It's just that after I heard the story,

1168
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:17,080
I think

1169
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:19,240
it doesn't have to be like this.

1170
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:20,960
You're saying I made a mountain out of a molehill?

1171
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:23,360
No.

1172
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:26,160
I feel for you.

1173
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:27,320
I condemn the intolerable behavior

1174
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:28,880
of my uncle!

1175
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:30,520
Over these years,

1176
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,680
I've never mentioned it to anyone.

1177
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:36,560
You're right.

1178
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:38,040
When I know too much,

1179
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:40,200
it will become a burden.

1180
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:43,160
Granny.

1181
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:45,280
Do you think Xiaoyu

1182
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:46,440
knows about this?

1183
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:49,400
She must know that I had a fallout with her dad.

1184
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:52,240
But she may not know what caused it.

1185
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:54,800
If your uncle

1186
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:57,480
wants to tell his side of the story,

1187
00:42:57,920 --> 00:42:59,480
I'd be

1188
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:01,400
the unreasonable one for sure.

1189
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,760
So, my uncle is not so bad.

1190
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:05,720
Not so bad, my ass.

1191
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:07,560
He's just too embarrassed to tell her.

1192
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:10,920
Granny, you're

1193
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:12,040
such a logical person.

1194
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:14,000
It's not about being logical.

1195
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:17,480
Harbor no ill-will toward others,

1196
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:20,240
but always be mindful of the ill-will
 toward yourself.

1197
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:23,400
I've never harmed anyone in my life.

1198
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:25,200
But I won't allow anyone to harm me

1199
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:27,920
that easily.
