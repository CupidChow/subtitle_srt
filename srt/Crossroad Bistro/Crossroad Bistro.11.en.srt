00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:56,200
Liu, come over here.

6
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,400
Let me make the introduction.

7
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,160
This is Liu Liangzhou, my boyfriend.

8
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,320
And this

9
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:07,280
is Peng Pai, my friend in Norway.

10
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:12,600
Welcome.

11
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:16,800
I haven't seen you in a while.

12
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,280
When we were in Norway,

13
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,480
you said you like this car.

14
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:23,160
I said it's impractical.

15
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,560
It was my fault for not gifting it to you.

16
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,800
It's your birthday today.

17
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,440
I bought it for you.

18
00:03:28,079 --> 00:03:29,320
I hope you still need it

19
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,480
and you still like it.

20
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:33,880
Happy Birthday!

21
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,400
Bao Xue,

22
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,280
take it from me as a gift.

23
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:48,800
Wait.

24
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,320
Mr. Peng gifted it to you,

25
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,440
but you're giving it to me.

26
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,200
Are you sure?

27
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,480
If you don't think fit,

28
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:55,600
use it as a prize for a lucky draw.

29
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,280
Give it to anyone who wins it.

30
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,160
I do think fit.

31
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:00,960
Thanks, sis.

32
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,040
I'll take it.

33
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,440
Are you alright with it?

34
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:04,760
I'm alright.

35
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:05,600
The car belongs to you.

36
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:06,960
You can give it to anyone you want.

37
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,840
Do you know what he gifted me?

38
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,800
He gave me all his heart.

39
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,640
Let's drink a toast to Mr. Peng together.

40
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:22,880
Get the wine.

41
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:23,800
Give me a cup.

42
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,200
Thank you for your generosity.

43
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:29,960
Dai,

44
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:33,080
How should I address Mr. Peng?

45
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:34,360
Is he more like an elder brother

46
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,360
or an uncle?

47
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,800
Let me see.

48
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:37,960
My sis calls him bro.

49
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:39,360
But he's too old for you, call him uncle.

50
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,200
Uncle.

51
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,240
I need to talk to you.

52
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:49,760
I'll wait for you outside.

53
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,760
Good.

54
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:57,760
Yaozhi.

55
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,159
Bring me the guitar.

56

57

You're still here.

00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,440
This is my studio.

91
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,840
There're so many photos.

92
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:28,280
Apart from being an actor most of the time,

93
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:29,640
I'm also a photographer.

94
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,760
Many celebrities come to me for photo sessions.

95
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:33,280
I live here, too.

96
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:40,679
Xiaoyu.

97
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,000
This place looks nice.

98
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:53,920
Sit here.

99
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,240
Let me take some photos for you.

100
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:56,800
Sure.

101
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,360
Give me any pose you like.

102
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,760
Did you have fun?

103
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,840
I'm not an idiot.

104
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,640
I know I was acting with you.

105
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,360
He's your boyfriend, right?

106
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,080
My ex.

107
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,000
You used me to get rid of him.

108
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,240
I just want him to give up soon.

109
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,680
Your professionalism makes these so different.

110
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:40,800
I'll photoshop the photos for you,

111
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:41,440
adjust the tone

112
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,560
and send them to you later on.

113
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:43,840
OK.

114
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,320
How long

115
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,560
do you plan to act in front of him?

116
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,480
Is it till tomorrow morning

117
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:07,600
or half a month later?

118
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,720
My acting stops at your studio.

119
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,280
It's a short video.

120
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,000
Do you want it to be a soap opera?

121
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,120
I can act in it with all my life.

122
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:43,440
Let's go, sir.

123
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,520
Your sister is heading back.

124
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,720
You're so stupid.

125
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,560
But I gave you such a good chance.

126
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:03,800
When she arrives home,

127
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:04,760
tell me.

128
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:05,840
OK.

129
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,320
Is everything alright between you?

130
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,880
There's still no place for me in your sister's heart.

131
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:16,880
Be patient.

132
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:18,480
Give her a bit of time.

133
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:20,000
I'm leaving tomorrow.

134
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,440
Spend more time with her when you're free.

135
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:00,880
Sorry, sir,

136
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,560
we're not open for business yet.

137
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:03,520
I'm not a customer.

138
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:04,720
I'm looking for someone.

139
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:05,680
Who are you looking for?

140
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:06,640
Is Dai Xiaoyu here?

141
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:07,640
No.

142
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:10,120
When does she usually come?

143
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,320
She doesn't come here often.

144
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,240
Ms. You, he is looking for Ms. Dai.

145
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,520
Are you Mr. Peng?

146
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:20,720
Yes, I am.

147
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,200
I know that

148
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,880
I hurt Xiaoyu a lot.

149
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,280
I also tried my best

150
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,560
to apologize to her sincerely.

151
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,880
It's not about an apology.

152
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:34,960
You stabbed her and drained her blood.

153
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,320
Do you think apologies work?

154
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,440
Even if you stitch the wound,

155
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:40,960
the scar will always be there.

156
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,000
You must know

157
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:43,840
how it works.

158
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:44,880
Yes, I do.

159
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:48,160
That's why I want to make it up to her.

160
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:49,920
I came back

161
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:50,960
to Shanghai

162
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,280
to get a divorce.

163
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:54,080
You've been with her for five years.

164
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:56,160
You only think about the divorce now.

165
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:57,880
Isn't it a bit late?

166
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:00,800
You shouldn't screw around if you're still married.

167
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,120
I didn't screw around with her.

168
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,520
I really am in love with Xiaoyu.

169
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,280
Mr. Peng,

170
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:12,160
I don't think you know what love is.

171
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:14,800
You know

172
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:15,640
that Xiaoyu is willful.

173
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:16,920
I've been patient and tolerant.

174
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:17,680
I know that I...

175
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:18,860
But patience and tolerance

176
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:20,760
are included in love by default.

177
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,320
For example, if my chef

178
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:24,400
tells me

179
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:25,240
"Oh look, boss,

180
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,600
I can cook this raw food",

181
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:28,440
do you think he should be proud?

182
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,240
Here's my advice.

183
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:41,040
Don't come to Xiaoyu again.

184
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:46,760
I...

185
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:48,080
I will not give Xiaoyu up.

186
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,320
That's not for you to decide.

187
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,640
Who are you to say that?

188
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:53,600
I am her friend.

189
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,600
As long as I'm here,

190
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:58,800
don't you dare hurt her again.

191
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,200
Good.

192
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:09,560
We shall see

193
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:12,480
what happens next.

194
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:16,640
What are you laughing at?

195
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,840
Stop playing the bully.

196
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,760
You don't have the acting skills.

197
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,520
Judging from what you have done,

198
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:24,720
I am most certain

199
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:27,320
you have never got into a fight with anyone.

200
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:29,760
If you have the balls at all,

201
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:31,280
you wouldn't have kept quiet

202
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:32,760
when she gave the car key to someone else

203
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:34,640
right in front of you on that day.

204
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:37,680
You were extremely selfish

205
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:38,760
when you were with her

206
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:40,560
but want to fight like Kilkenny cats
 after breaking up.

207
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,720
And then you claim that you love her.

208
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:45,040
Don't you think it's ridiculous?

209
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:46,800
If I were you,

210
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,600
I'd get lost and go back to Norway long ago.

211
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:51,720
Have a new life.

212
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:54,440
Let go of Dai Xiaoyu and let go of yourself.

213
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:56,960
If you don't let go of her, I won't let you get away with it.

214
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,120
Mr. Peng,

215
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,920
have I made myself clear?

216
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:34,600
Zhao Henan.

217
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:35,480
What's wrong?

218
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:36,680
A dish for table No.7 is sent back.

219
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:37,680
Why?

220
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:38,760
The customers complained

221
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:40,160
that the pork liver is overcooked.

222
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:41,640
Yi Dang.

223
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:45,040
Did you make this?

224
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,120
Refire.

225
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:48,280
Chef.

226
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,720
Can you show me how to make it?

227
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,520
I think there's nothing wrong with the way I did it.

228
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:54,280
Come here.

229
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,560
You must heat the oil to a high temperature,

230
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:19,200
deep fry the liver for no more than thirty seconds 
 and drain immediately after.

231
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:20,680
Otherwise, the liver won't be in good shape

232
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:21,960
if the oil keeps heating it.

233
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:35,920
The lower the temperature is, the longer it takes 
 to cook the liver

234
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:37,280
and the drier it becomes.

235
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,360
Can you remember?

236
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:44,840
Yes, chef.

237
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:46,920
Don't do that again.

238
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:47,960
Now wash the wok.

239
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:55,040
Why aren't you paying respect to a royal concubine?

240
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:57,840
Greetings to you, my lady.

241
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:00,640
Good, good.

242
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,600
Where are you now?

243
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:03,800
I'm in the company.

244
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,640
How long has it been since we last met?

245
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:07,599
41 days.

246
00:17:08,839 --> 00:17:10,240
Is it still cold in Beijing?

247
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,960
I'm not wearing cotton-patted jackets but T-shirts.

248
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:14,040
I heard it's over 20 degrees over there.

249
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:15,599
It's even warmer than here.

250
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:17,040
Then why don't you come back soon?

251
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:18,760
Feel the warmth of spring.

252
00:17:19,319 --> 00:17:21,359
It won't take long. We will wrap soon.

253
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:24,480
But I have to go to Tianjin first.

254
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,339
Because I will act in

255
00:17:25,339 --> 00:17:27,280
a three-day stage play over there.

256
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:29,600
Alright. I will give a dinner for you when you're back.

257
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:32,440
Then I will list the dishes I want to eat.

258
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,720
All actors and actresses in place.

259
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,800
There's no time. The filming will begin.

260
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:37,640
Bye-bye.

261
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:38,520
Bye-bye.

262
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,840
Another performance is done.

263
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:51,080
Miaomiao, let's have a midnight snack later.

264
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,880
Alright. Let's remove the makeup first.

265
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,160
Yeah, let's do it.

266
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,480
Today was not bad.

267
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:58,480
You did a great job, everyone.

268
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,160
Hello.

269
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:27,080
May I ask who it was

270
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:29,480
that sent me so many messages?

271
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:34,360
I was on the stage.

272
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:37,720
It's a play, dude.

273
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:39,160
Do you think it's some kind of soap opera

274
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:41,240
where I can take a rest between shootings?

275
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:45,200
Tomorrow is the last performance.

276
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,720
Why? Are you missing me like crazy?

277
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:53,160
It's Chinese people's traditional value 
 to admit things bravely.

278
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:55,760
Me?

279
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:57,480
I didn't miss you at all.

280
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,560
Alright, alright.

281
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:02,640
I know.

282
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,640
Ok. Alright.

283
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:05,840
I'll go.

284
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:06,960
Bye-bye.

285
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,880
Don't arrange anything this evening.

286
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:39,320
Chongqing Hotpot. It's my treat.

287
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,600
It's too late. Arrangements are made.

288
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:45,240
That's my bro. You saved me money.

289
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:05,480
Starting navigation now.

290
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,960
[Tianjin Port]

291
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,560
[Tianjin Boundary]

292
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:10,200
[Tianjin City Center]

293
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:15,480
Students,

294
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:18,240
our school is taken over by the troops.

295
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,360
I will give you one last lesson today.

296
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:24,920
Please open the textbook.

297
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:28,560
We are studying

298
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:31,520
Farewell today.

299
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,560
It's written by Li Shutong

300
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:37,400
when he was bidding a good friend Xu Huanyuan farewell.

301
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:39,600
I will read it to you first.

302
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:46,800
Outside the resting arbor, beside the ancient thoroughfare;

303
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:51,040
The fragrant grass so green, stretching to meet the sky afar.

304
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:55,400
The evening breeze brushing the willow,

305
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:57,080
the flute sound lingering;

306
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:01,400
The setting sun beyond hills and mountains.

307
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:02,800
Ms. Zhou.

308
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:07,160
The troops are at the school gate.

309
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,880
A senior official said if you don't leave,

310
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,960
they will blow up the roof.

311
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:16,960
Let's go.

312
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:21,040
I know.

313
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:27,880
At the verge of heaven, at the four corners of the earth,

314
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,760
My bosom friends are half gone and no longer seen.

315
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:34,480
With a gourdful of turbid wine, enjoy the last moment of pleasure;

316
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:38,360
The parting dream turning cold this very night.

317
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:33,440
Honestly,

318
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,120
when I saw you appear out of nowhere,

319
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:37,400
I was indeed a bit moved.

320
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,640
Don't get moved yet.

321
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:45,640
Sign it for your fan.

322
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,840
Come on. Are you making fun of me?

323
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:50,680
Of course not, I'm a decent man.

324
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:52,400
It was my first time seeing you on stage.

325
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,720
That's monumental.

326
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,720
Was my performance alright?

327
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:01,880
Let me say the truth.

328
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:05,720
I think you really

329
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:07,400
outshined the female lead.

330
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:09,880
You're usually not serious at all,

331
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:11,560
but you played the sad role

332
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:14,360
so well.

333
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:16,000
I even cried.

334
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:18,640
I won't buy that.

335
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:20,560
I'd be a pig if I lied to you.

336
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:21,960
Don't you degrade pigs!

337
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:27,240
Is there something wrong with you?

338
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:30,480
Did you seriously spend 980 RMB
 for my supporting role?

339
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:32,880
Who told you it's 980?

340
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:34,480
The scalper in front of the theater

341
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:35,640
profited 500 from me.

342
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,760
Why did you buy a pig in a poke?

343
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:42,240
Let me tell you.

344
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:43,480
From what I could see,

345
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:46,800
everyone on the stage was black and white,

346
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,600
only you had colors.

347
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:51,080
It was worth it.

348
00:23:56,080 --> 00:24:00,920
You gave me goosebumps.

349
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,080
But your words

350
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:08,480
are somehow so appealing to me.

351
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:12,680
What are you going to do?

352
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:14,240
Returning to Beijing?

353
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:16,720
Aren't you going home?

354
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:17,760
Yeah, I am.

355
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:20,720
Get my luggage with me first.

356
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:23,520
Here we go.

357
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:26,880
Take it, my fan.

358
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:28,520
Thank you.

359
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:32,000
I will mount it on the wall when I go back.

360
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,800
She was like, "Why are you here?"

361
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:57,360
But the actor didn't know

362
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:58,840
it was in the script.

363
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,960
So he told the actress:

364
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:03,000
"Sis, I'm a swing."

365
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:06,280
Then everyone laughed like crazy.

366
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:08,440
He even said it on stage with a lowered voice.

367
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:09,800
You know?

368
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,520
It was super funny.

369
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:13,720
Anything could happen on stage.

370
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:15,360
I thought it's just about forgetting the lines.

371
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:16,040
Then, they just...

372
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:17,280
Of course no.

373
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:18,840
Forgetting lines isn't even a problem.

374
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:20,880
Seriously, there're so many accidents on stage.

375
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:25,880
What's happening?

376
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:30,040
Why has the elevator stopped?

377
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:38,120
What's happening now?

378
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,480
I'll go check.

379
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:44,920
Careful.

380
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,640
We're not trapped here, are we?

381
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:53,120
Any findings?

382
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:56,720
Don't worry. I'm trying to do something.

383
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:00,360
Hello. Is anyone there?

384
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:02,760
There's something wrong with the elevator.

385
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:04,120
Anyone there?

386
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:05,080
Can you hear me?

387
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:05,840
Hello.

388
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:08,520
The elevator breaks down. We are falling.

389
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:09,880
Can you hear me?

390
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:11,400
- Hello. 
 - Hello?

391
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:13,680
We're doomed.

392
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:15,640
If I die here,

393
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:17,840
it will be too unfair.

394
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:19,440
Can you hear me?

395
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:21,680
Yes, I can.

396
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:23,720
Are you trapped?

397
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:25,320
Yes, we're trapped.

398
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:27,360
Which floor are you on?

399
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:30,640
I can't see it.

400
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:31,680
Calm down.

401
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:33,600
It's okay. Stop crying.

402
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:36,760
As long as it's not falling, we're safe.

403
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:39,200
It's alright. Let's stay here

404
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,200
and wait for them to rescue us.

405
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,640
What if they don't come?

406
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:42,600
You pressed so many buttons

407
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:44,040
but nothing happened.

408
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:45,080
We're doomed.

409
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:46,920
If the elevator falls,

410
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:48,240
we will fall to death.

411
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:50,520
If no one comes to help us, we will starve to death.

412
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:51,960
No one starves to death that easily.

413
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:53,960
I am very much hungry now.

414
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,760
I will surely die before you.

415
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:57,320
We're dead.

416
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,320
Anyone there?

417
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:02,600
Come on. Stay quiet for a moment.

418
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:04,080
No one will hear your cry.

419
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:08,560
I, Yu Songyang,

420
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:09,720
hereby solemnly promise

421
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,680
if anything happens to me

422
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:14,120
and I die,

423
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:15,280
I will donate

424
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:16,720
all my properties

425
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,040
to Ms. Bao Xue

426
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:19,240
without asking for any returns.

427
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:22,360
Do you feel reassured?

428
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:25,720
Come on.

429
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:26,760
We're together.

430
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:28,160
If you die, I won't survive either.

431
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:31,040
Your favor is so cheeky.

432
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,280
So you aren't that scared.

433
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:35,560
Why are you still laughing?

434
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:36,720
Come on, get up.

435
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:37,680
No, I won't.

436
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:38,680
What if it falls later on?

437
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:39,920
Listen to me.

438
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:42,120
It will save your life.

439
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:43,560
Now listen.

440
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:47,120
If the elevator falls all of a sudden,

441
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:50,360
make good use of the last few seconds,

442
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:51,840
jump on me

443
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:53,280
and hug me tight.

444
00:27:53,650 --> 00:27:54,480
Do you remember?

445
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:57,520
Are you ashamed of yourself?

446
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:59,520
Why do you still have this perverted idea before dying?

447
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,200
Why are you so dirty?

448
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:03,360
Listen carefully.

449
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:05,560
When the elevator crashes,

450
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:07,760
you will be on me and my feet will touch the ground first.

451
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:09,240
That tiny bit of buffer

452
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:10,960
will give you a better chance of surviving.

453
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:12,160
Do you understand?

454
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:14,600
Use me as a buffer now!

455
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,520
We're dying!

456
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,200
We're all gonna die!

457
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:27,000
The will is invalid now.

458
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:35,280
I was scared to death.

459
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:36,880
I'm sorry, madam.

460
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:37,960
We are too late.

461
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:39,320
You are too early.

462
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:43,360
Fix your elevator properly.

463
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:45,560
- I'm so sorry. 
 - Sorry.

464
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:57,560
How much money do you have?

465
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:03,240
I bought the flat and car with a loan.

466
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:06,840
So you were trying to dig me into a hole.

467
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:20,640
Today, you did two things

468
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,520
that move me a lot.

469
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:27,080
What will you do to thank me?

470
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:31,200
I'll buy you a midnight snack.

471
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:35,920
It's so late.

472
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:37,280
Not many places are open now.

473
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:39,960
Where do you want to go?

474
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:47,280
My place.

475
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,680
I have good food and good drinks.

476
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:57,080
Do you want to go?

477
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:02,840
Are you a mute?

478
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:04,120
Do you want to go or not?

479
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,200
Why are you so chatty?

480
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:07,960
If I say nothing, I'm giving consent to it.

481
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:15,200
We're here.

482
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,720
Is it your place?

483
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:20,480
What kind of place is it?

484
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:22,200
Why does it look like a factory?

485
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:33,120
Make yourself at home.

486
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:40,880
Is that you?

487
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:42,480
Yeah.

488
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,040
Do you have a vase?

489
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:45,600
Give it to me first.

490
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:55,920
What's this?

491
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:58,680
It's for my daily training.

492
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:26,160
Did you really design this place?

493
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:27,240
Yeah.

494
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,400
I used the cheapest chipboard.

495
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:31,320
No one else uses it in decoration.

496
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:34,280
That's cool.

497
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:35,680
I like it.

498
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:36,880
Here. You're hungry.

499
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:38,120
Have an apple first.

500
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:39,480
Thanks.

501
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:40,440
Have a look around.

502
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:41,640
I'll cook a steak for you.

503
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:43,880
I didn't know you can cook.

504
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:49,120
I'll deal with the flowers, then.

505
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:51,400
The vase is over there.

506
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:27,560
Men who can cook are so sexy.

507
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:33,400
I'm not Mr. So Sexy. I'm just me.

508
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:04,040
I have a good wife at home.

509
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:05,960
Be quiet. The children are asleep.

510
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:08,600
How much did you drink?

511
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,360
I controlled it well.

512
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:11,600
Be quiet.

513
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:14,040
Cao wanted to keep drinking

514
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:15,840
but I stopped him with determination.

515
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:18,560
I only had two more bottles of beer.

516
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:04,480
It was all because of that two bottles of beer.

517
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:07,960
Here. Drink some honey water.

518
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:16,320
No. Don't touch me.

519
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:30,639
Why did you break up with Shen Peihong?

520
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:32,840
My sis says she's nice.

521
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:36,199
Why do all women love to ask this kind of question?

522
00:34:37,159 --> 00:34:38,920
All women?

523
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:40,400
Who else asked?

524
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:43,440
Everyone.

525
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:46,199
Tell me the truth.

526
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:48,960
How many girlfriends did you have?

527
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:56,800
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven,

528
00:34:56,800 --> 00:35:00,000
eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve...

529
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:01,840
...a hundred...

530
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:03,600
Less than 200.

531
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:06,520
Don't try to get away with it.

532
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:08,560
Be specific. How many were there?

533
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:10,440
Three.

534
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:13,800
Is that what you call less than 200?

535
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:15,000
But it is less than 200.

536
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:18,400
But you haven't told me.

537
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:20,800
Why did you break up with Shen Peihong?

538
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:25,360
When a couple gets together,

539
00:35:25,570 --> 00:35:27,280
it's because they appreciate each other.

540
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:29,720
If they stay together, they tolerate each other.

541
00:35:30,090 --> 00:35:31,760
It was difficult for me and her to tolerate

542
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:33,600
each other because of our personalities.

543
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:35,680
Both of us can't stand bad behaviors at all.

544
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:45,840
I am very good at tolerating others.

545
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:48,400
My last boyfriend is one year younger than me.

546
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:49,680
He's a boy

547
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:52,480
who never grows up.

548
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,240
I had to be his dad one minute

549
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,400
and his mom another the next.

550
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:56,800
Apart from his daily routines,

551
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:58,440
I had to take care of everything else.

552
00:35:58,440 --> 00:35:59,520
Even when it was like that,

553
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:01,640
I stayed with him for almost half a year.

554
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,520
But ever since that,

555
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:05,240
I swear

556
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:06,840
I will never ever

557
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:08,920
get into a relationship with any boys younger than me.

558
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:11,160
Because it's so tiring.

559
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:16,160
Did you both decide to break up?

560
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:19,040
No.

561
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:20,080
I brought it up.

562
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:23,040
He didn't really want to break up with me.

563
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:25,360
Then it's not surprising.

564
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:28,440
Love doesn't last forever.

565
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:31,320
Love works like that all over the world.

566
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:35,680
Falling in love is like being deeply hypnotized 
 by each other.

567
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:38,240
The best outcome is when both wake up together.

568
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:40,290
The worst is when one wakes up first

569
00:36:40,290 --> 00:36:41,920
while the other one is still dreaming.

570
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:43,400
You

571
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:45,520
were the one who woke up first.

572
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:51,680
If I didn't wake up,

573
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:53,960
you wouldn't be seeing me right now.

574
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:56,760
Fine.

575
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:58,000
I'll wake up first next time.

576
00:36:59,020 --> 00:37:00,280
What are you talking about?

577
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:01,880
You're so bad at words.

578
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:03,880
We'll wake up together.

579
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:09,880
Do you want to know

580
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:12,320
how many exes I have?

581
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:13,760
No.

582
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:15,760
Wrong answer. You do.

583
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:18,600
You want it a lot.

584
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:22,040
Fine.

585
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:25,120
Ask me then. Ask.

586
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:28,480
How many boyfriends did you have?

587
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:36,560
500?

588
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:37,960
5,000?

589
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:40,960
I woke up 5,000 times.

590
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,440
[Li Xiang]

591
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:56,720
What are you doing?

592
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:58,960
You have nothing to do.

593
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:00,520
But I'm busy over here.

594
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:01,960
I'm really busy these days.

595
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:03,560
Talk to you later when I have time.

596
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:37,240
We're running out of beer.

597
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:38,680
Do you really want more?

598
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:42,280
It's just one small barrel. You're not sincere.

599
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:44,040
Alright.

600
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:46,840
You can have your way today.

601
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:50,240
It's a deal, then.

602
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:51,520
You need to make me experience

603
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:53,040
extreme sports with you.

604
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:54,440
Okay?

605
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:56,800
Deal.

[On the next episode]

607
00:38:56,840 --> 00:39:01,480
[Extreme sports: do not imitate without training]

608
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:02,720
Do you want to die?

609
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:08,000
Don't move.

610
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:09,000
Ms. Bai.

611
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:11,000
Try to lie on your back.

612
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:12,840
I'm on my way now.
