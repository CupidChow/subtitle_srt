tell your granny about this yesterday?

don't keep it from her.

If she knows about this,

98
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,480
she will put down everything, come here

Think before you say it.

111

It looks the same as when we were dating.

you should be secretly happy.

What's the new script about?

151

Can I have breakfast?

00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:27,920
Breakfast?

156
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,440
It will be lunchtime if you survive 
 another half an hour.

157
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,039
Eat the pills.

158
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,039
But I have recovered.

159
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:36,440
Can I stop taking them?

160
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:39,120
As you said, medicine has its side effect.

161
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,000
Only the doctor can judge if you have recovered.

162
00:08:41,669 --> 00:08:43,559
Wait until the follow-up checks the day after.

163
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,600
If the doctor says you don't have to take them,

164
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,600
you can stop then.

165
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,800
But now, you have to take them.

166
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:49,560
OK.

167
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,080
Grandma,

168
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,920
why don't you go and sing these days?

169
00:08:58,560 --> 00:08:59,400
It's getting cold.

170
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,720
We have suspended the activities.

171
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:05,200
It's windy these days, and the temperature will drop.

172
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,880
You're not allowed to go out, too.

173
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,080
I see.

174
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,680
How long has it been since you

175
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:22,760
started writing?

176
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,440
Almost three years.

177
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:29,200
Did you

178
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,240
get in contact with other companies before?

179
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,120
Yes, I did.

180
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:34,400
I have a WeChat public account for writing.

181
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,480
Before this, a company

182
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,500
liked the novels I wrote in the public account

183
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:40,080
which are all about different characters.

184
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,960
They wanted to use the stories as short film plots.

185
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,240
Have you talked about this fairy tale

186
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:47,880
with any other companies?

187
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:48,760
No.

188
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:50,840
I wasn't planning to write a fairy tale anyway.

189
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:52,200
But,

190
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,600
after I had a daughter,

191
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,720
she asked me to tell her

192
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,040
bedtime stories every night.

193
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:58,400
You know, just to put her to bed.

194
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,800
I was making up stories.

195
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:01,680
But when it went on,

196
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:04,000
I found out everything was connected

197
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,720
and the logic became clearer.

198
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,360
That's why I started writing.

199
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:11,000
But that's how things happen in general.

200
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:14,040
The most precious stories are written

201
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,880
when you don't intend it.

202
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:20,120
Many things grow in the gardens

203
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,800
that were never sown there.

204
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:26,320
Right.

205
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,320
My colleagues

206
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:30,400
are in charge of evaluation and I

207
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:31,330
have read your work.

208
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:33,240
All of us like it a lot.

209
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:34,080
Thank you.

210
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,400
But I have a proposal.

211
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:37,640
Tell me.

212
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,760
With the material you present me,

213
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,960
if we were to publish them,

214
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,360
they are too much for one book

215
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,600
but not enough for two.

216
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,040
My suggestion is

217
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:49,600
to do two things at the same time.

218
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:51,960
On the one hand,

219
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,280
finish what you're writing now

220
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:56,640
and make the length of the story enough for two novels.

221
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,640
We can immediately publish a set of

222
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:01,520
fairy tales with two volumes

223
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:03,600
with your names on them.

224
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,320
On the other,

225
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:07,080
I have contacted friends

226
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,280
from an internet platform.

227
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:09,920
Together, we can

228
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,360
record a set of audible books

229
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,720
specifically for kids

230
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,800
as bedtime stories.

231
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:15,880
This way,

232
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,560
many parents

233
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:19,240
can save a lot of time.

234
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:22,240
In the future, if the market response is good,

235
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:25,280
we also plan to make it into an animated cartoon.

236
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:26,880
What do you think?

237
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:27,720
Sure.

238
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:29,440
Of course, I agree.

239
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:30,960
Good, then.

240
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:33,120
Here's a contract.

241
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:35,240
The terms are very detailed.

242
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,800
Take it back and have a look.

243
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,760
If you have any questions,

244
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,200
contact me anytime.

245
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:41,640
OK.

246
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,360
I'll have a look now.

247
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,360
It's worth a lot.

248
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:03,160
Copyright is the most valuable.

249
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,160
Although the payment is good,

250
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,440
your work pressure

251
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:10,000
will be quite heavy after signing the contract.

252
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,720
You can't write only when you have time

253
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:13,960
just like before.

254
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,080
All the clients

255
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,760
are waiting for you to deliver something.

256
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:18,680
Rest assured.

257
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:20,920
I will never delay what I promise you.

258
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:21,920
OK.

259
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,360
I look forward

260
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:27,520
to working with you.

261
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,400
Me too.

262
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,320
Liu.

263
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,600
I'd like to ask you something.

264
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,920
When others take a photo,

265
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:47,280
the person is in focus

266
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:48,840
and the background is blurred.

267
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:50,440
But in my photo,

268
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,800
both the person and the background are in focus.

269
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,600
What's the reason?

270
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,000
If I guess it right,

271
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,400
you are using a normal lens.

272
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:58,400
Yeah.

273
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,960
When I bought the camera,

274
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:01,400
it was included in the whole set.

275
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,640
If you want to take a portrait,

276
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:04,480
you need to use a medium telephoto lens.

277
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:08,720
I need to buy a medium telephoto lens.

278
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:10,000
You don't have to buy one.

279
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:10,880
I can gift you one.

280
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:12,400
That's too kind.

281
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:13,400
How about this?

282
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,920
Make me an offer and I'll buy it.

283
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:15,880
It's okay.

284
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:16,730
I have several.

285
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:17,560
Let's do it like this.

286
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:18,560
When you have time,

287
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:19,520
come to my studio.

288
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:20,730
I can teach you photography.

289
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:23,000
I'm retired.

290
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,040
I have time every day.

291
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,160
How about tomorrow?

292
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:29,360
Tomorrow?

293
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,280
No problem.

294
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:32,240
That's great.

295
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,040
After I know how to do it,

296
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:36,080
I can take photos of Mrs. Bai.

297
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,760
Bring her with you.

298
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:39,920
Thank you.

299
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,780
Go to the living room and stay with Liu.

300
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:43,600
It's okay.

301
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,280
He and Doctor Lu are chatting happily.

302
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:47,320
I will kill the mood.

303
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,000
Grandma,

304
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,480
what do you think of Liu?

305
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:54,800
What do you mean?

306
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,600
He looks really good, right?

307
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,040
But you can't earn a living by good looks.

308
00:15:00,830 --> 00:15:02,440
As long as he treats you well, it's fine.

309
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,800
He treats me well indeed.

310
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:06,120
But it's still the probation period.

311
00:15:06,450 --> 00:15:07,800
What's the probation period for?

312
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:10,600
Even when you buy a television, you have to 
 test the quality.

313
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:12,200
When it's a living person,

314
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,440
you have to be more careful.

315
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,920
You don't want eye candy.

316
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,080
Why are you judging others?

317
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:19,160
You only have good looks left.

318
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:20,440
Exactly.

319
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:22,520
I have more reason to find a practical guy.

320
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,280
You're like a criminal suing the victim.

321
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:26,240
You're in the wrong

322
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,840
but defend yourself by sophistry.

323
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,440
Tell Liu

324
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:30,840
not to hurry back.

325
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,720
Let's have dinner at home.

326
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,280
I will cook him dinner.

327
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:36,360
I'll make pearl-like glutinous rice and pork balls.

328
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:38,680
I don't need to tell him.

329
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:39,840
He isn't in a hurry at all.

330
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:40,720
I'll also make

331
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,440
Yam pork ribs soup.

332
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:43,640
No.

333
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,040
Liu Liangzhou is allergic to yam.

334
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:47,480
What isn't he allergic to?

335
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:51,800
He can't eat

336
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,400
lotus root,

337
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,040
okra and anything

338
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,040
that is sticky inside.

339
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,360
Alright.

340
00:15:58,720 --> 00:15:59,880
Pork rib soup, then.

341
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:00,840
I won't add the okra.

342
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:02,600
Perfect.

343
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,280
I'll thank you for him.

344
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:11,320
What do you think?

345
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:12,880
Any problems?

346
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Very formal.

347
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:18,720
Very carefully phrased.

348
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:19,760
What else?

349
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:22,960
Very strict.

350
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:25,920
In what way?

351
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,520
The terms are way too detailed.

352
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:32,360
If you can't accomplish or fulfill

353
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:33,720
any of these,

354
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:35,800
you might be liable for the breach of the contract.

355
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:37,560
Then it's alright if I don't break the terms, right?

356
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:44,160
But you need to work very hard in the next few months.

357
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:47,320
I don't mind hard work.

358
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,520
I've thought it through.

359
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:50,400
It's always better early than late.

360
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,000
They give me two months

361
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:52,920
to finish the novel, right?

362
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,760
I'm going to finish it in one month.

363
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:58,320
Then you will have no time at all

364
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,400
to take care of our family.

365
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,360
But didn't you promise me to spend

366
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,920
more time taking care of the children

367
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:06,359
and the family?

368
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:07,720
You regret it, right?

369
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:08,599
No.

370
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:09,960
I was just saying

371
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,640
because you won't have any time for our family,

372
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:14,280
I will do it.

373
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:15,880
No problem.

374
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:17,680
I'm just afraid

375
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:20,520
that I am

376
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:21,319
a clumsy person.

377
00:17:21,319 --> 00:17:22,800
You're not clumsy.

378
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,200
Don't overestimate me.

379
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:27,880
I've been thinking.

380
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:30,040
How about

381
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:31,440
we hire a nanny?

382
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,120
What do you think?

383
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:33,200
Don't.

384
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:36,720
Nannies can't be as devoted to the children as the dad.

385
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:38,800
I knew you'd be waiting to say this.

386
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,240
Tell me the truth.

387
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,120
Were you startled to see my royalties?

388
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,840
In the end, writers like you are the best.

389
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:53,880
You can just be idle.

390
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:55,080
But once you start working,

391
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,560
others will envy you.

392
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,000
Just tell me, am I good?

393
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:02,320
In the future,

394
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:03,880
you don't have to go to work.

395
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:05,960
I will write and provide for you,

396
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:07,560
OK.

397
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:10,240
You're really good.

398
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:13,240
After finishing this book,

399
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:14,320
I'll write a new one.

400
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:15,760
I have already named it.

401
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:18,680
It's called Forcing My Husband to Be A Toy Boy.

402
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:20,440
I'll write one too.

403
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:22,880
I'll call it Proudly Being a Toy Boy.

404
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:55,320
One, two, three, four.

405
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:02,560
I want to try, too.

406
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:03,840
Here.

407
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:12,800
One, two, three, four.

408
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:15,440
Come on.

409
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:23,640
One, two, three, four.

410
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:27,840
Good.

411
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:29,600
Shake it evenly.

412
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,320
Use the same strength back and forth.

413
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:34,640
One, two, three, four.

414
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:35,400
Good.

415
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:41,480
I haven't seen you so excited for many years.

416
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:44,080
Your birthday is approaching.

417
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:46,080
But you know that I never celebrate birthdays.

418
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:47,840
Let's celebrate it this time.

419
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,280
What for?

420
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,560
I just want to celebrate it for you.

421
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:59,000
Look at me.

422
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,720
Is there something wrong?

423
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,040
What could possibly go wrong?

424
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,200
I'm alright.

425
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,200
What medicine did you take?

426
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:11,720
The supplements you bought me.

427
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:16,160
Look. The supplements.

428
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:16,980
I didn't lie to you.

429
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:25,200
But we agreed

430
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,010
that we won't keep anything from each other.

431
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:28,800
You're so suspicious.

432
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:30,160
I'm not keeping anything from you.

433
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:35,640
[Crossroad Bistro]

434
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:45,200
Let's go.

435
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:48,080
It's windy outside and must be really cold.

436
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,440
Listen to me and take a taxi.

437
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:50,560
I'll ride the motorcycle alone.

438
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:52,200
Aren't you cold?

439
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:54,800
I'm used to it.

440
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:56,320
No.

441
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:57,800
We are a family, right?

442
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,760
We have to share joys and sorrows.

443
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:01,840
What about we both take the taxi?

444
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:04,200
It's not safe to leave the motorcycle here all night.

445
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,640
Be good. Take the taxi.

446
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:09,240
No.

447
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:13,040
Alright, then.

448
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:30,160
Hop up.

449
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:35,440
Hug me tight and you won't be cold.

450
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:10,920
Why are you still awake?

451
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:12,440
I'm not sleepy yet.

452
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:13,320
Go to bed first.

453
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:18,760
I'll pour more water for you.

454
00:22:22,030 --> 00:22:23,640
Why are you drinking coffee at this time?

455
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:25,520
You don't plan to sleep tonight, do you?

456
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,040
Go to bed first.

457
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:29,120
I'm fired with creative inspiration.

458
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,640
My proverbial juice is starting to flow.

459
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:36,720
Don't be too tired.

460
00:22:43,650 --> 00:22:44,600
Hurry up and get inside.

461
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:45,520
I'm so cold.

462
00:22:58,760 --> 00:22:59,880
You're frozen.

463
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:01,800
My face is numb thanks to the wind.

464
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:03,840
Do nothing else

465
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,160
and take a hot shower now.

466
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,040
Be good.

467
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:45,160
Don't tell me you haven't slept.

468
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:47,360
I'm sleepy.

469
00:23:47,830 --> 00:23:49,280
I don't have the strength to write.

470

Good job.

471
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,920
You work too hard.

472
00:24:00,310 --> 00:24:02,200
I'll take the children to school later on.

473
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:05,000
But you need to pick them up for me today.

474
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:08,880
I need to go to the client's place this afternoon.

475
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,200
I will get back

476

after dinner, more or less.

519
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:13,000
The camera is good.

520
00:25:11,830 --> 00:25:15,370
♫And fight till the end of time♫

521
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:13,840
No.

522
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,880
You look good.

523
00:25:16,290 --> 00:25:18,420
♫Little did we know that in front of life♫

524
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:20,800
I didn't even think I'd take such a good photo.

525
00:25:18,590 --> 00:25:20,530
♫We♫

526
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:23,120
It looks great.

527
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:24,240
Liu.

528
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:27,600
♫We don't stand a chance♫

529
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:26,160
Mrs. Bai

530
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,440
deserves

531
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:29,560
such a great camera.

532
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:31,880
♫Don't leave me. Don't miss me♫

533
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,120
The camera's good.

534
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:32,000
The lenses are nice, too.

535
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:34,680
But people are vital in photography.

536
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:35,190
♫Things aren't always what they're supposed to be♫

537
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:37,800
The photographer and the model need to connect

538
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:38,940
♫Don't talk to me. We all make compromises♫

539
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:39,600
to achieve a good photo.

540
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:46,290
♫We are on the crossroad♫

541
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:42,240
You see?

542
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,440
Dr. Lu, believe it or not.

543
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:45,440
If the model is Xiaoyu, I'll do a better job than you.

544
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:46,200
Of course.

545
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:47,400
It's the same.

546
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:48,400
If I take a photo of Mrs. Bai,

547
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:49,720
I'll never be as good as you.

548
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:51,760
You two both did well.

549
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:52,800
So great.

550
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:53,880
Looks awesome.

551
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:55,160
Liu.

552
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:57,000
Come here.

553
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:57,960
Coming.

554
00:25:58,040 --> 00:25:59,200
Don't mind us.

555
00:25:59,200 --> 00:25:59,960
We'll check the photos.

556
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:00,720
Okay.

557
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:07,920
What's wrong?

558
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:09,280
Who's she?

559
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:10,680
Jin Chen.

560
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:12,040
An actress. You don't know her?

561
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:14,440
Is she beautiful in person?

562
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:15,680
Not as beautiful as you.

563
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,120
But you took such a good photo of her.

564
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:18,600
You just said you can only take a good photo

565
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:19,600
when you connect with the model.

566
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Well...

567
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,400
Listen to yourself.

568
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:24,280
Do you like her?

569
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:25,920
What are you talking about?

570
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:26,920
I only like you.

571
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:28,440
Then when do you hang her photo out here?

572
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,080
This is work.

573
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:33,280
I don't want her here.

574
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:34,520
I put this photo here to show the clients.

575
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:35,520
Put it away.

576
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:36,640
Or, I'll get angry.

577
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:41,280
How about I put your photo up here?

578
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,440
Like you have a choice.

579
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:45,680
But she does look pretty.

580
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:52,360
Xiaoyu.

581
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:55,520
I don't have any large portraits of yours.

582
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:58,480
I'll pick one

583
00:26:58,480 --> 00:26:59,600
and print it in a large format, okay?

584
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:10,320
I've told you already.

585
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,680
I am doing an indie film.

586
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,120
The director told us

587
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:16,640
our film will win big awards in Europe.

588
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,120
Give me a break.

589
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:19,840
An indie film?

590
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:22,200
You haven't started shooting

591
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:23,040
and you're thinking about awards?

592
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:25,000
What indie film is that?

593
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:26,520
I think it's vanity.

594
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:29,760
Come on.

595
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,240
You didn't even read the script

596
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:32,720
and yet you're so judgmental.

597
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:34,280
I think my part is beautifully written.

598
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:34,880
Seriously.

599
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:36,240
Besides,

600
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:39,400
it is a once-in-a-lifetime

601
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:40,640
opportunity for me.

602
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:47,440
Bao Xue,

603
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:49,200
think about it.

604
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:53,240
There are so many great actors.

605
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:55,720
Why did they choose you?

606
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:58,760
Hua introduced me to them.

607
00:27:58,760 --> 00:27:59,840
Will Hua marry you?

608
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,720
Are you trying to pick a fight?

609
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:07,080
I am, actually.

610
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,560
I am your boyfriend.

611
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:12,040
Maybe I'll be your husband one day.

612
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:14,400
I don't want you to star in a film like this.

613
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:15,560
Will you listen to me?

614
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:18,000
You said it's a back shot.

615
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
What if the director

616
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:19,680
wants you

617
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:21,000
to do a frontal nude scene for artistic effect?

618
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:22,960
You'll have signed the contract by then.

619
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:24,360
Will you turn around?

620
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:25,880
I am a professional actress.

621
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:28,720
If that is what the part needs,

622
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:30,720
I will turn around.

623
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:31,920
Needs?

624
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:36,040
Have you seen Malena?

625
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:37,640
In the end,

626
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:38,680
the leading actress was stripped naked

627
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:40,040
and humiliated in the piazza.

628
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:43,440
The scene is a mockery and exposure
 of the darkest human nature.

629
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:46,080
And The Dawns Here Are Quiet.

630
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:47,640
There is nudity in that film, too,

631
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:50,280
to praise the youthful life.

632
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:51,720
Those films need scenes of nudity.

633
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:53,280
Why does your crappy film need nudity?

634
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,240
It's a scene of you taking a shower.

635
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:57,400
It's purely for marketing purposes.

636
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:58,760
Yu Songyang.

637
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,200
I am an adult.

638
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:01,720
Don't I have the right

639
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:04,320
to my body?

640
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:05,280
If that's the case,

641
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:08,720
then why do I need

642
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:10,160
your permission to go climbing?

643
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:12,400
That's not the same, okay?

644
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,200
What's not the same?

645
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:15,800
You're comparing your hobby with my career.

646
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,920
My girlfriend is doing a nude scene.

647
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:19,360
Don't I have the right to feel uncomfortable?

648
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:20,240
You do.

649
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:21,520
You're making me very uncomfortable.

650
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:25,640
Why are you so selfish?

651
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:27,920
I gave up mountain climbing for you.

652
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:30,040
Do you know how miserable I feel?

653
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:34,840
You feel miserable giving that up?

654
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:36,080
Yu Songyang.

655
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:38,040
You told me before that

656
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:39,400
you gave up mountain climbing

657
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:40,560
because you love me.

658
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:42,600
I thought you were feeling happy.

659
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:43,840
Turns out you feel miserable.

660
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:47,600
If

661
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:50,000
our relationship makes you miserable,

662
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:52,840
let's just end it,

663
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:53,880
shall we?

664
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:54,760
I hate to see you miserable.

665
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:03,440
If you can give up on us so casually,

666
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:05,760
then I won't pester you.

667
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:06,400
Right?

668
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:07,240
Yeah.

669
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:08,840
Why are you doing this?

670
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:29,080
I'll get the check.

671
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:30,480
Okay. This way.

672
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:01,760
Hello.

673
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:03,920
Where is the man who was sitting here?

674
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:04,760
He paid the check and left.

675
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:07,360
Is this your phone?

676
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:08,640
Yes.

677
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:09,360
Thank you.

678
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:10,200
It's alright.

679
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:21,000
Hello?

680
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:24,000
You just left me there by myself, right?

681
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:27,440
I don't want to hear you explain.

682
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:28,520
Just go.

683
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:29,520
Bye.

684
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:05,200
Stop it, alright?

685
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,440
I thought you had left.

686
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:08,080
Would I have left my phone there if I had left?

687
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:09,240
I didn't see your phone.

688
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:10,080
That means

689
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:11,720
you never even thought about calling me.

690
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:13,040
I left on an impulse.

691
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:14,080
And you just did the same?

692
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:14,560
Fine.

693
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:15,960
Let's just leave each other.

694
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:19,800
Where are you going?

695
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:24,440
I'm meeting the director to sign the contract, okay?

696
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:25,200
Bao Xue.

697
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:27,360
You don't care about my feelings at all.

698
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:28,480
Think about it.

699
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:29,120
If you leave now,

700
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:29,520
then we are...

701
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:30,320
Whatever.

702
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:34,720
Open the door.

703
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:36,360
Bao Xue.

704
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:44,920
Did you sign the contract?

705
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:46,480
Yes.

706
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:52,680
The coffee is bitter.

707
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:56,120
The beans are from Yunnan province.

708
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:58,120
Not the same as others.

709
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:00,800
It tastes astringent at first.

710
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:01,880
But the aftertaste is sweet.

711
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:04,560
And the coffee with sugar and milk in it?

712
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:05,720
It tastes sweet at first.

713
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:07,200
But the aftertaste is astringent.

714
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:10,240
Interesting.

715
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:12,600
Ma'am,

716
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:14,360
you look young.

717
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:16,880
I think we're of similar age.

718
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:20,600
Don't call me ma'am.

719
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:22,360
We are of the same age.

720
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:28,120
What gave you the idea

721
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:29,400
of doing a film in this genre?

722
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:31,720
There are so many interesting genres.

723
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:34,880
Do you think people are born virtuous?

724
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:39,880
Aren't they?

725
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:41,840
Virtue

726
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:44,280
is taught.

727
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:45,800
Many kids know that

728
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:47,000
if they cry,

729
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,840
they can get whatever they want.

730
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:50,840
Sometimes, they lie to adults

731
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:52,360
to get sympathy and love.

732
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:55,120
Some people think these kids are cute and smart.

733
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:56,680
But in fact,

734
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:58,720
this is human nature.

735
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:02,240
We are born selfish and greedy.

736
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:04,640
When we were kids,

737
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:06,440
we shared our toys and snacks

738
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:07,600
with other kids

739
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:08,600
to make them happy,

740
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:09,040
right?

741
00:34:09,639 --> 00:34:10,239
That was because

742
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:12,280
we were taught to do so by our teachers and parents.

743
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:15,480
Many people didn't receive such education
 when they were kids.

744
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:17,199
So they might commit crimes.

745
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:19,400
So, I'm making this crime film

746
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:21,280
to get to the bottom

747
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:22,080
of this issue,

748
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:23,600
so more people can learn about

749
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:25,960
those who have never received education.

750
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:27,000
Then we can help them

751
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:28,960
and thus make this world a better place.

752
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,880
If I hadn't seen you for myself,

753
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:33,920
I wouldn't have believed

754
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:35,520
I am hearing this from

755
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:37,320
a young girl in her twenties.

756
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:40,639
To be honest,

757
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:43,560
my father funded this film.

758
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:45,800
He...

759
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:48,080
He's always wanted me to make some comedy.

760
00:34:48,199 --> 00:34:49,000
He said to me,

761
00:34:49,159 --> 00:34:50,760
"Make yourself happy.

762
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:52,040
Make others happy, too."

763
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:53,520
But, there's

764
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:55,159
only so much happiness in the world.

765
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:56,719
Let me ask you.

766
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:00,120
What are the seven emotions in Buddhism?

767
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:03,200
Joy, anger, grief, sentiment, sadness, fear, and surprise.

768
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:05,000
Yes.

769
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:06,840
Among the seven words,

770
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:09,280
only one means happiness,

771
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:10,280
which means

772
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:12,080
most of our emotions

773
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:13,520
are not happy ones.

774
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:15,440
I said to my dad,

775
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:18,600
"We might lose money on this film,

776
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:19,560
but you gotta let me

777
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:21,360
do something I like.

778
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:22,760
Maybe later,

779
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:23,840
I'll make something you like

780
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:25,320
to make it up to you."

781
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,920
Do you know Pedro Almodovar?

782
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:30,040
Yes.

783
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,040
I've watched one of his films

784
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:32,920
called Talk to Her.

785
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:35,920
Have you seen Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down! ?

786
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:37,240
No.

787
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:38,760
This film that I want to make

788
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:39,400
is partly

789
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:41,120
inspired by that film.

790
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:42,480
Is that so?

791
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,240
What is it about?

792
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:45,280
It's about a story

793
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:46,560
where I love you

794
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:47,560
but you don't love me.

795
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:49,040
So I have to tie you up and tie you down

796
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:50,960
until you fall in love with me.

797
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:52,440
In the end, you'll realize that

798
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:53,560
in this whole world,

799
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:55,280
I am the only one that loves you the most.

800
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:01,280
It sounds

801
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:02,920
nothing like the film

802
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:04,400
we are making.

803
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:05,440
They're the same.

804
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:07,720
They're all about love and abduction.

805
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:09,240
Besides Almodovar,

806
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:10,440
you know Kim Ki-duk?

807
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:11,160
Yeah.

808
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:12,720
Have you seen his 3-Iron?

809
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:13,880
No.

810
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:16,920
I've got a copy.

811
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:17,920
I'll show you.

812
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,480
I've got both. You can watch them back home.

813
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:23,760
Okay.

814
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:24,440
Yeah.

815
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:25,720
See if they'll help you build up character.

816
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:27,240
This film

817
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:28,080
doesn't have many lines.

818
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:29,640
So it requires you to act it out.

819
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:31,640
You can study these films

820
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:32,640
and build up your character.

821
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:33,440
Will do.

822
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:34,040
Great.

823
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:35,520
Then there is

824
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:37,080
the nudity part.

825
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:38,120
Are you okay with that?

826
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:41,680
If that scene

827
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:43,400
is really needed in the film,

828
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,040
then I am okay.

829
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:46,600
Great.

830
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:56,280
Hello, honey.

831
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:57,040
Sweetie.

832
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:58,400
Where are you?

833
00:36:58,440 --> 00:36:59,680
I am waiting for you to go home together

834
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:01,520
Come to the shop.

835
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:04,000
Okay.

836
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:14,520
Sweetie.

837
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:16,360
Whose car is this?

838
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:17,320
Hop on!

839
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:18,440
Go on.

840
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:26,680
Whose car is this?

841
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:28,280
Ours.

842
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:33,040
I won't ride a motorcycle in the future.

843
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:34,080
I'll drive this instead.

844
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:35,240
You

845
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:38,400
won't have a cold nose anymore.

846
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:45,760
Great.

847
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:52,400
Why me?

848
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:54,480
Why me?

849
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:55,880
If you don't do this film,

850
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:59,320
I'll cancel my flight for tomorrow.

851
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:00,920
Okay.

852
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:02,360
Good luck.

853
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:07,980
♫Love, hate, emotions, revenge, grudges♫

854
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:06,040
Is there any other way?

855
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:07,040
Or maybe

856
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:08,840
we can try targeted therapy.

857
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:09,840
It's too late.

858
00:38:10,180 --> 00:38:15,980
♫My mood is on a rollercoaster ride♫

859
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:12,880
We found primary tumors in his lungs and colon.

860
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:15,440
The cancer cells have spread to his pelvic, 
thoracic and lumbar vertebrae.

861
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:18,160
They'll travel through the lymph system anytime.

862
