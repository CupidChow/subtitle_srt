4
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:20,600
You're talented, huh?

5
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:29,560
Do you feel that I am really childish?

6
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:32,000
No.

7
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,000
After we experienced this,

8
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:36,440
I actually think sometimes I was the childish one.

9
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:37,880
My HQ is low.

10
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:39,920
From now on, I will study hard and make progress 
 every day.

11
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,960
What's your plan for studying?

12
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,320
In the future,

13
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:46,040
I'll just get more relationship experiences.

14
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,800
Then I have to nip your plan

15
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:54,240
in the bud.

16
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,720

What marks did you get in the final exams?

42
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,120
100.

100.

46
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,760
Absolutely true.

47
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:56,920
He got all the answers right

48
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,440
but forgot to write his name.

♫We don't stand a chance♫

50

It's 100, anyway.

51
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:01,840
His teacher said

52
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,480
if he forgets it again, he will not pass.

53

Don't do it again.

56
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:06,600
Take it serious.

57
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:09,440
♫Fortune or doom♫

58
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:07,520
Mom.

59
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,400
I have news, too.

60
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,360

♫Loss or gain♫

62
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:12,440
I finished all the courses on Banma AI KE.

63
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:14,200
I also got three stars

64
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,280
for all of them.

65
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,360

66
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:19,029
♫We are on the crossroad♫

67
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,279
You're excellent, too.

68
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:19,120
Wife, how about

69
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,160
your novels?

70
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,800
Ten minutes before you knock,

71
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,560
I finished the last word.

72
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,160
Wonderful.

73
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:27,480
It seems like the retreat works a lot.

74
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,520
16 days, right?

75
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:29,280
Yeah.

76
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,160
You're really tough.

77
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,280
Are you hungry, Zhuang?

78
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,280
I'm starving.

79
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,560
Let's go. I'll take you to lunch.

80
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,280
Let's go.

81
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:35,720
To lunch.

82
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,360
This place is not bad.

83
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,159
Dad.

84
00:04:38,159 --> 00:04:40,560
I really want to have milk and bread.

85
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,770
Your daughter wants milk and bread.

86
00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:43,520
They're just ahead.

87
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,620
I'll get them for you later on.

88
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:45,159
OK.

89
00:04:45,159 --> 00:04:46,720
You know how to apply what you've learned.

90
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,320
Banma AI KE is useful.

91
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:52,200
There are still a lot of people here in cold winter.

92
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:54,000
All of them are property owners here.

93
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,960
There aren't many tourists.

94
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:56,800
Really?

95
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:57,360
Yeah.

96
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,120
Let's sit there.

97
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:03,440
The amenities match this place.

98
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,280
They do, right?

99
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:05,640
Sit.

100
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:06,650
After we finish eating,

101
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:08,150
I will take you outside for a walk.

102
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:08,720
OK.

103
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:12,480
Here.

104
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,720
Bread and milk for Yuanyuan.

105
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,080
What's this?

106
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,040
We're going to an art museum.

107
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,120
An art museum.

108
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:22,440
I think it looks like a hole over here.

109
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:24,160
Zhuang, keep an eye on your sister.

110
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,120
I will.

111
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,280
This place echoes.

112
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,440
I have an idea.

113
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:38,720
What is it?

114
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:43,320
We have a flat and a car.

115
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:44,760
Your income isn't low.

116
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:45,680
We don't

117
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:48,040
have to spend too much on the two kids.

118
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,480
After I receive the royalty this time,

119
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:51,000
I plan to use it for investment.

120
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,040
What do you think?

121
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:56,360
Are you going into the stock market with You Shanshan?

122
00:05:56,810 --> 00:05:58,800
Why do you only think about the stock market?

123
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,800
Do you want to invest in Crossroad Bistro?

124
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:08,560
Can you come up with something 
 unrelated to You Shanshan?

125
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:15,040
I can't think of anything, then.

126
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,840
I want to buy a house here.

127
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:20,680
Here. Hold them.

128
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,640
Drink slowly. They're hot.

129
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:23,560
Thanks.

130
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:25,360
Let's go.

131
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:27,130
These days

132
00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:28,040
I've been staying here.

133
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:30,600
When I couldn't continue writing, I went out for a walk.

134
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,360
I realize this is a really nice place.

135
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,200
Look, a supermarket is over here.

136
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,520
The canteen is over there.

137
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,600
There's also a restaurant,

138
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,640
a cinema,

139
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:38,600
a hospital,

140
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,320
a bar

141
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:40,040
and everything.

142
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,040
They have everything.

143
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:44,360
But I wonder if we must buy a flat here.

144
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:45,960
Think about five-star hotels.

145
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:47,440
How much do they cost per day?

146
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,960
How many days a year will you stay there?

147
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:50,530
With this frequency,

148
00:06:50,530 --> 00:06:52,200
even if you continue for the rest of your life,

149
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,040
it won't cost half as much as buying a flat.

150
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,920
You are genuinely

151
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,280
a professional accountant.

152
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:01,040
But you didn't calculate right.

153
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,880
Staying in hotels is traveling.

154
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,520
Buying a flat is settling down.

155
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:05,920
With a flat,

156
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,200
it won't be part of my travel plan

157
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,840
the next time we come here.

158
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:10,160
It will be returning home.

159
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,520
If we don't have enough time,

160
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:15,040
we can entrust the flat to the B&B service center.

161
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,200
We just need to collect the rent

162
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,640
and don't have to worry about anything else.

163
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:18,880
Let me put it this way.

164
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:21,840
It's not that I must buy a house by the sea.

165
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,320
I want a way of living

166
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:25,400
that allows me to escape from the city.

167
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,480
That's why I said

168
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:29,720
it's not just about money or calculation.

169
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,240
Can you understand if I put it like this?

170
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,560
Why are you looking at me?

171
00:07:39,159 --> 00:07:41,760
Have you been planning this speech for several days?

172
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:45,159
Just tell me if I have your support or not.

173
00:07:45,159 --> 00:07:46,130
I agree with the sense

174
00:07:46,130 --> 00:07:47,409
of escape that you talked about.

175
00:07:47,409 --> 00:07:47,920
OK.

176
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:48,920
And then...

177
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:49,360
This

178
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,000
is real estate, after all.

179
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:51,680
OK.

180
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,480
You like it.

181
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,240
A wife's decision can never go wrong.

182
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:56,720
Let's buy it.

183
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,760
Mom, can I go there?

184
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:00,640
Go on and take your sister.

185
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:01,600
With your support,

186
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,840
I will put it on my calendar, okay?

187
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:04,960
You've made up your mind.

188
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,760
Let's skip the democratic procedure, alright?

189
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,160
Today,

190
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,880
does it count as you're back in business?

191
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:24,760
Shanshan.

192
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:26,760
Your friends don't know Hei yet, right?

193
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,240
Properly introduce him later on.

194
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:28,840
There's no need.

195
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,200
I'll go and greet them now.

196
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,880
Happy birthday.

197
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:40,280
Thank you.

198
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,480
Shan.

199
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:43,200
Happy birthday.

200
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,440
Thank you.

201
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,360
Happy birthday.

202
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:45,880
Thanks.

203
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:47,560
Happy birthday.

204
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:48,920
Haven't you brought anything?

205
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:50,360
Of course, I prepared a gift.

206
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:50,920
Here.

207
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:51,880
Thanks.

208
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,000
For tonight,

209
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
bon appetit!

210
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:54,470
Alright?

211
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:55,360
Don't worry about that.

212
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,440
We will enjoy ourselves.

213
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,560
Take care of yourself.

214
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:58,280
Alright.

215
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:58,840
OK. Let's go there.

216
00:08:58,840 --> 00:08:59,280
Go on.

217
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:00,080
OK.

218
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,120
Boss.

219
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:03,080
Happy birthday.

220
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,120
Thank you.

221
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,120
But you never celebrate birthdays.

222
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,520
I want to do it this year, can't I?

223
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:11,640
Happy birthday, Ms. You.

224
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,000
Don't use that title, okay?

225
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,240
Stop saying "Ms."

226
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,550
Happy birthday, Shan.

227
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:18,600
You don't have to work today.

228
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,560
You can drink.

229
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:20,680
Alright. I'll try.

230
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:21,760
She will skip it.

231
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,680
You spoil your wife so much.

232
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,680
I'm pregnant.

233
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,600
Good news.

234
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,720
Feng Xi is pregnant.

235
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,200
Really?

236
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,360
It's been a few months.

237
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,720
I knew it not long ago.

238
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,120
I haven't been to the hospital.

239
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:43,900
Congratulations.

240
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:46,480
Don't forget to invite us

241
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,080
to dinner.

242
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:48,960
I'll answer the phone.

243
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:49,560
Alright.

244
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:00,480
Shanshan.

245
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,840
Happy birthday.

246
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,400
Happy birthday, Shanshan.

247
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:05,000
Where are you?

248
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,560
We're in Aranya.

249
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:07,880
Mom, I want to talk to Aunt Shan, too.

250
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:09,560
Yuanyuan and Zhuang want to speak to you.

251
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:14,160
Happy birthday, Aunt Shan.

252
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,160
Thanks.

253
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:16,640
Thank you, Zhuang and Yuanyuan.

254
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:17,680
It's so overwhelming.

255
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:18,240
Alright.

256
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,280
It's really lively over there.

257
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:21,080
We won't take up your time.

258
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:21,440
OK.

259
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,680
Let's meet after you come back.

260
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:28,920
Bye-bye.

261
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,320
It's Shanshan's birthday today.

262
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,320
Happy birthday, Shanshan.

263
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:40,800
My two bros and I

264
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,800
will perform first.

265
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:44,000
One.

266
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:44,360
Two.

267
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:44,880
Three.

268
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:45,640
Four.

269
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:57,440
One.

270
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:57,880
Two.

271
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:58,320
Three.

272
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:58,960
Four.

273
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:22,280
Happy birthday.

274
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,360
Isn't your wife here?

275
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,800
She was here and has left.

276
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,880
She is getting old and sleeps early.

277
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,080
She nurtures her health.

278
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:58,720
Dance with me.

279
00:11:58,720 --> 00:11:59,800
I don't know how to.

280
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,440
Dance with me.

281
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:04,080
I'm not doing that.

282
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,560
I will dance with my wife.

283
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,120
Mr. Chai,

284
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:13,920
let's dance.

285
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,120
What's wrong?

286
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:24,920
It's okay.

287
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:01,240
Who is he to you?

288
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:05,440
My loved one.

289
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:13,839
Shan.

290
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:15,880
Where is Shan?

291
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:18,599
She was here just now.

292
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:19,640
Haven't you noticed?

293
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:21,280
He has disappeared, too.

294
00:17:27,869 --> 00:17:32,060
♫ Bitter, spicy, savory, sweet, sour♫

295
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:39,240
♫ Love, hate, emotions, revenge, grudges♫

296
00:17:41,670 --> 00:17:47,790
♫ My mood is on a rollercoaster ride♫

297

♫ We are on the crossroad♫

00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:15,790
♫ Just let me go♫

300
00:18:16,090 --> 00:18:18,480
♫ Give me a warm hug♫

301

♫ A kiss that feels cold♫

302

♫ I can't curb my enthusiasm♫

303

♫ I will always remember my dream♫

♫ It's the promise I'll never break♫

♫ It's the promise I'll never break♫

318
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:32,560
How did the negotiation go?

319
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:36,040
I was talking to you.

320
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:40,160
After having lunch,

321
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:41,960
you started checking the phone.

322
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:43,440
Wait a moment.

323
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:44,280
Let me see.

324
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:45,320
Come on.

325
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:46,320
Let me see.

326
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,560
Nailed it.

327
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:49,600
What is it?

328
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,720
From now on,

329
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:52,960
I am a proud driver

330
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,080
working for online car-hailing platforms.

331
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:57,000
Online car-hailing driver?

332
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:57,820
Let me tell you.

333
00:20:57,820 --> 00:20:59,480
The drama I went to talk about in the morning

334
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:01,820
requires me to play the role of 
 an online car-hailing driver.

335
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:03,600
I have to experience it in life, right?

336
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:04,520
Come on.

337
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:06,440
Your car doesn't fit the requirements at all.

338
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:07,720
The crew is really reliable.

339
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:09,560
They have arranged a car for me.

340
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:11,920
How long will you do it?

341
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:13,280
As long as I need,

342
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:16,040
until I feel like the character in the drama.

343
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,880
But aren't you a supporting actress?

344
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:21,160
What's wrong with supporting actresses?

345
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:23,440
If a supporting actress doesn't perform well,

346
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:26,280
she will never have the chance to become 
 a leading actress.

347
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,160
But you are such a bad driver.

348
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:30,040
Can you manage it?

349
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,800
Don't belittle me.

350
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:33,040
It's not like you don't know.

351
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:33,720
I have been

352
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:35,640
an experienced driver for five years.

353
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:36,720
I know.

354
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:40,520
I'll leave.

355
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:41,600
What are you going to do?

356
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,470
I'll go and accept requests.

357
00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:45,080
You stay in character really quickly.

358
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:46,440
Of course.

359
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:49,160
I hope I can pick up a handsome guy in my first service.

360
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:56,360
Hello.

361
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:57,280
Can I ask

362
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:59,360
if your number ends in 9090?

363
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:00,920
Yeah.

364
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:03,840
Shall we follow the navigation?

365
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:04,960
Go.

366
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:06,840
Please buckle up.

367
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:08,440
We will set off now.

368
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,720
You are just a girl.

369
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:21,040
Why do you do this as a job?

370
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,000
There's nothing wrong

371
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,840
with girls doing this, right?

372
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:27,040
Men and women are equal nowadays, right?

373
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:28,360
All of us

374
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:29,720
earn money through working.

375
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:30,440
Right?

376
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:32,360
Right.

377
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:35,720
Thumbs up for you.

378
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:37,600
Please buckle up.

379
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:41,880
I...

380
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:58,040
Hello.

381
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:00,120
My dear partner.

382
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:03,000
Bring me the large bucket.

383
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:04,880
What happened?

384
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,200
Wait for me.

385
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:12,720
I've washed it with three buckets of water.

386
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,120
Why does it still smell so bad?

387
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:19,920
I can't breathe.

388
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,040
The first day at work

389
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:25,560
and you learn a lesson.

390
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:26,720
Damn right.

391
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,880
The biggest experience I got today

392
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:31,760
is that after 9 p.m,

393
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:34,840
I have to keep a close eye on drunk alert.

394
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:46,240
What did she eat?

395
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:47,000
Stop talking.

396
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,200
Hold your breath.

397
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:01,920
[Anniversary Sale, 30% off on everything]

398
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:49,840
Hello.

399
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:52,920
Check out from the long-term rented room 
 at the hotel.

400
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:54,800
Move all the things to the drum workshop.

401
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:58,280
Now.

402
00:24:58,280 --> 00:24:59,240
Do it now.

403
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:37,440
What's wrong, Ms. You?

404
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:39,000
Ask Manager Feng to come in.

405
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,080
OK.

406
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:42,640
Here, sis.

407
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:43,560
Let's drink.

408
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:44,520
Cheers.

409
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:48,280
We shouldn't skip anyone between us.

410
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,120
Songyang, let's drink.

411
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:52,920
Alright, let's drink.

412
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:53,520
Cheers.

413
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:54,080
Here.

414
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:54,760
What's the problem?

415
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:55,840
Skipping no one.

416
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:59,200
Come here

417
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,560
and sit.

418
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:04,000
I'm not asking you to drink.

419
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,760
Just sit down and stay with me.

420
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,160
Chat with me.

421
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:09,200
There are so many people outside.

422
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,120
You don't have to be there.

423
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:11,000
You have no idea.

424
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,560
There are so many customers today.

425
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:14,200
We will probably break the record again.

426
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:16,200
I won't drink with you.

427
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,760
I'll drink tea instead of alcohol.

428
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:18,760
I wish you

429
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:20,160
a happy anniversary.

430
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:23,280
Happy anniversary.

431
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:26,800
Thanks for your hard work.

432
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:28,000
OK. Go on drinking.

433
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,160
I will return to work.

434
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:30,640
She works hard.

435
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,400
Feng Xi is so responsible.

436
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:34,360
She is pregnant,

437
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:36,000
yet she still works so hard.

438
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:37,480
Get me a cup of water.

439
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:38,760
Feng Xi

440
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:42,560
is a good person.

441
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:45,880
She is part of my family.

442
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:52,080
Hei is your loved one

443
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:54,080
and Feng Xi is your family.

444
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:56,920
What are us to you, then?

445
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:58,480
We are her

446
00:26:59,240 --> 00:26:59,880
bitches.

447
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:03,240
No.

448
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,040
The two of you

449
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:10,120
are my lovers.

450
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:15,240
Cheers, lovers.

451
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:15,960
Cheers.

452
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:17,320
Happy anniversary.

453
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:19,320
Happy anniversary.

454
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:21,840
I won't join the celebration between lovers.

455
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,040
It has nothing to do with you.

456
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:29,080
What is Chai

457
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:30,440
busy with recently?

458
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:31,920
It's almost the end of the year.

459
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:34,160
We've put off a lot of things to the next year.

460
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:35,960
These days, I just have to see a few clients with him

461
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:37,120
and nothing else.

462
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,440
What about you two?

463
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:42,000
Where will you stay during the New Year?

464
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,760
We will stay here

465
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:45,440
for this New Year.

466
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:46,520
My parents

467
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:47,640
will return to Beijing.

468
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:48,760
Then,

469
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:50,800
his parents will come here, too.

470
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:53,520
The two families plan to

471
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:54,400
meet this year.

472
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,640
Feng Xi

473
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,320
is happy with Zhao Henan.

474
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:06,600
You are happy together, too.

475
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:07,960
Not to mention Si Meng.

476
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:08,920
She's on the beach.

477
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:12,920
We are the unhappiest ones.

478
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:17,120
What are you talking about?

479
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:19,680
Those who have the same misfortune 
 sympathize with each other.

480
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:20,760
Shan,

481
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:21,920
what are you thinking about?

482
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:22,840
Tell me.

483
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:26,640
How about

484
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:28,720
we take a holiday overseas

485
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:29,880
and return in the New Year?

486
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:32,560
That's great.

487
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:33,640
I'm okay with that.

488
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:37,160
You're okay with that?

489
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:40,160
But uncle and aunt will come here today.

490
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:41,800
What are you planning?

491
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:43,680
But you're staying at home, right?

492
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:44,800
It's settled.

493
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:46,680
Alright,

494
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:47,920
just relax

495
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:49,240
and have a happy holiday.

496
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:50,960
You've got us at home.

497
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:51,640
Come on.

498
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:52,440
Cheers.

499
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:53,760
Cheers.

500
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:57,920
I'm happy.

501
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:07,720
Wife,

502
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:09,400
here.

503
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:10,200
Drink the nest soup.

504
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:11,600
It nourishes you in a slow but steady way.

505
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:12,870
It's good for you and the fetus.

506
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:16,120
Have you thought about it?

507
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:17,400
How many days should we rest?

508
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:19,080
I've thought it through.

509
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:21,440
We don't have many private rooms, so we won't 
do new year dinners.

510
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:23,520
The vacation starts from the day 
 before New Year's Eve

511
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:26,100
and ends on the seventh day of the New Year. 
 We will go to work on the eighth.

512
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:26,880
The eighth?

513
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:30,880
Many sellers won't return to work

514
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:31,800
on the eighth.

515
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:33,720
The vegetables are easy to get.

516
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:35,440
Look.

517
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:36,680
We have to prepare these

518
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:38,920
before the New Year.

519
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:41,000
Otherwise, we won't be able to open for business on the eighth.

520
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:43,400
Alright.

521
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:44,040
Settled?

522
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:44,600
Yeah.

523
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:50,400
When should the two of us...

524
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:51,800
No.

525
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:53,120
It's the three of us.

526
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:54,600
When should we return to my hometown?

527
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:58,240
There're many customers before the New Year.

528
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:58,960
Let's

529
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,800
return on the day before New Year's Eve.

530
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:03,960
Okay.

531
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:05,720
What about your parents?

532
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:07,200
They will go to my grandma's place in Wuhan

533
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,000
on New Year's Eve.

534
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,050
They will go to your hometown 
 on the third day of the New Year.

535
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:12,920
Don't forget to book the tickets for them.

536
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:14,640
You don't have to remind me.

537
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:14,600
Why are you looking at me?

538
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:40,440
