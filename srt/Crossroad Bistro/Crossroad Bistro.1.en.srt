00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,280
Have you picked a wedding date?

4
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:38,720
Should be on the 20th of next month.

5
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:41,560
Have you told your parents?

6
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,040
No.

7
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,400
Forgive me for saying this,

8
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,960
but I still think you need to tell them about it.

9
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:56,520
We've not spoken for two years.

10
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:59,800
My dad has burnt all the bridges

11

to separate me and Peng Pai.

He said he never wants to see me again.

13
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,320
What about your mom?

14
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,600
You're not talking to her, either?

15
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:10,080
She's on my dad's side.

When it comes to this, parents usually mean well.

20
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,560
Maybe they just handled it poorly.

21
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,920
Does that mean I have to do as they say?

22

First of all, I am not a homewrecker.

Second, I don't ask them for money.

What have I done wrong?

25
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,800
People can change the way of handling things.

26
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,160
But it's them who handled it wrong should change.

Then suddenly, I felt

111
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:49,080
I was shrinking to this big

112
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,480

00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,160
But you're still married to her.

177
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:15,280
If I didn't want to marry you so badly,

178
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:16,080
you wouldn't have even

179
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,480
sent the divorce paper to your ex, right?

180
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:18,760
We've separated for 7 years.

181
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:19,840
7 years!

182
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,360
I have no feelings for her.

183
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,880
We just didn't sign the divorce paper.

184
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,040
I get it now.

185
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,320
I am less important than a divorce paper.

186
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:29,080
You're twisting my words.

187
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,480
Excuse me?

188
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,960
I should be grateful that you got ill.

189
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:35,400
Otherwise, I'll never know about all this.

190
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:37,120
As long as you're still married,

191
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,480
I'll be the homewrecker.

192
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:40,960
Your wife and your daughter will think

193
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,080
you want to divide your property

194
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:44,040
because you've got a calculating lover abroad.

195
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:45,280
Thank you very much.

196
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:46,200
Because of you,

197
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,200
I've now become the kind of person I hate the most.

198
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:52,240
I've never intended to lie to you.

199
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,480
I've always wanted to get a divorce,

200
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:55,200
but I've been too busy to deal with it.

201
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,240
I couldn't go back to China

202
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,840
and sign the divorce paper.

203
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,760
That's the only reason why I didn't do it!

204
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:10,400
Xiaoyu.

205
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,200
I'll just divorce her

206
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:14,680
and give her and my daughter my property in China.

207
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:16,080
Then we can live

208
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:18,400
a happy life here, okay?

209
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,080
What about your will?

210
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:24,080
It's written clearly on the will

211
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:27,160
that if you die of any cause,

212
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:28,920
90% of your property

213
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:31,360
will go to your daughter.

214
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,000
The other 10% will go to your wife.

215
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:34,280
Did I remember it right?

216
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,960
It was outdated.

217
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:39,160
I can update it after I divorce her.

218
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,040
I've spent five of my best years with you.

219
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,160
When you were sick, I was running around

220
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,720
taking care of you.

221
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,840
What am I to you?

222
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:57,600
A nurse?

223
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,480
Even a nurse gets paid daily.

224
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,280
And me?

225
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,800
I'm your secret lover.

226
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,160
What are you talking about?

227
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:14,800
Calm down, will you?

228
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:19,320
It all happened so quickly.

229
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:21,200
I didn't prepare for it.

230
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:22,880
Nevertheless,

231
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,600
it was never my intention to do this to you.

232
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,080
You know that, right?

233
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,480
I know it a bit too well.

234
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,240
It's all written on the document.

235
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:31,960
I'm not illiterate.

236
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,000
I can read.

237
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,160
You're despicable.

238
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:37,760
Think all you want.

239
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:38,880
Whatever.

240
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:43,960
I made a mistake about the divorce.

241
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:45,280
I wanted to deal with it later.

242
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:46,360
It's just a matter of time.

243
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:47,400
My ex-wife was fine with it.

244
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:48,400
Stop right there.

245
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:50,720
You haven't divorced her yet.

246
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:51,760
She's still your wife.

247
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:52,800
Not your ex-wife.

248
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,320
Do you have to get all technical about it?

249
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,480
Shouldn't I?

250
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:57,280
No!

251
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:59,200
I almost married you.

252
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,440
I think we can

253
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:16,400
take a break and calm down.

254
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,040
I'll leave for Manchester for a 3-day business trip.

255
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:19,720
We can talk it over

256
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,760
when I come back.

257
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:23,440
I will keep

258
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,040
my promise to you.

259
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,480
Xiaoyu, I am back

260
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:48,880
Xiaoyu?

261
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:05,400
Xiaoyu?

262
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:41,440
Sorry, the subscriber you dialed is out of service.

263
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,240
Hello, sis.

264
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:56,880
It's midnight where you are, right?

265
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,440
Have you not slept yet or already gotten up?

266
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,360
How's everything going?

267
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,160
Which date should I book my flight for?

268
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:06,319
That I don't care.

269
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,520
I booked my flight for yesterday.

270
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:10,040
What?

271
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,560
Where were you going?

272
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:14,359
I'm in Beijing visiting my grandma and my sister.

273
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:44,300
[Ep01]

274
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:43,880
Xiaoyu?

275
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,360
Grandma.

276
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:58,080
Why are you back?

277
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:02,600
Grandma.

278
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:04,960
Great.

279
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:09,680
Just spend some time with me.

280
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:11,040
Don't buy anything.

281
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:12,360
Just a token of my gratitude.

282
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:13,600
Yeah, granny.

283
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,640
It's time that she did it.

284
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:16,920
These are all premium snacks.

285
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,800
I'll take them all if you don't like them.

286
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,160
You wish.

287
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:21,080
I like them.

288
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:22,640
Right.

289
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,360
Grandma, keep them all.

290
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:25,800
These are yours.

291
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:28,080
There's no such thing as enough Bestore snacks.

292
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:29,680
Granny.

293
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:30,360
When I was little,

294
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:31,880
you used to peel walnuts for us.

295
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:33,640
Today, I'll peel walnuts for you.

296
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:35,720
Great, thanks.

297
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,040
Thank you, grandma.

298
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:41,400
You're using my sweet gesture to please her?

299
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:43,080
How could you do that?

300
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:43,880
Xiaoyu.

301
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:47,320
You've never had a full-time job

302
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:49,480
since you finished your postgraduate study.

303
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:55,160
There's no such thing as a full-time job anymore.

304
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:56,200
They're all temps.

305
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:00,240
Even government officers are contract employees.

306
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,600
They can quit whenever they want to.

307
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:03,720
Life is slow abroad,

308
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,040
so I've become lazy and casual

309
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:06,800
after staying there for long.

310
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:08,040
You can't be like this.

311
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:09,600
You're young.

312
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,800
You can't just sit around all the time

313
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:12,920
like us old people.

314
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:14,240
Yeah.

315
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:15,760
I think

316
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:18,160
I won't go back for now.

317
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:20,280
I'll live here with you for a while.

318
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:22,440
I'll move out once I find

319
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:23,880
a good job and an apartment.

320
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:24,920
What do you say?

321
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:27,520
No problem.

322
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:30,080
But I'll be upfront with you.

323
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,560
Don't stay for too long.

324
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:33,040
I'm used to living here alone.

325
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:34,200
It's kinda inconvenient

326
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,680
with someone else here.

327
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:38,120
Okay.

328
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:42,160
Granny.

329
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:44,840
I also love your sweet-and-sour ribs.

330
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:46,080
I've mentioned it several times

331
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:48,120
and you didn't even make them once.

332
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:51,080
It's been years since she last had this dish.

333
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:53,680
Just now,

334
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:55,880
when I glanced over Xiaoyu,

335
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:58,040
I almost didn't recognize you.

336
00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:00,480
She is getting prettier and prettier.

337
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:01,440
You, on the contrary,

338
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,000
are getting uglier.

339
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:07,000
Granny! I am what they call a "second-glance beauty."

340
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:10,400
That's why you are not famous yet.

341
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,800
The directors always choose beauty at first glance.

342
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,360
You are one of those first-glance beauties.

343
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:16,800
But you don't even have a proper career.

344
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,000
What's a proper career?

345
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:18,840
Like yours?

346
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:20,360
Of course.

347
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:21,320
I don't steal or rob people.

348
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:22,760
I love my country.

349
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:24,840
It's better than someone
 who hasn't found her career path.

350
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:27,920
When you can't find the right path,

351
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:30,360
it's better to just stop where you are.

352
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:31,160
I...

353
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:33,320
You haven't changed a bit.

354
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:36,200
Two minutes into a nice conversation

355
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,920
and you're already arguing.

356
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:38,880
Dinner is ready.

357
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:41,560
She's been picking on me since I was a kid.

358
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:44,200
I can take whatever criticism comes my way.

359
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,600
I picked on you 'cause you were a loser.

360
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:47,520
When we were at school,

361
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:49,400
you didn't even know
 how to simplify a complex fraction.

362
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:53,160
Just look at those roles you play.

363
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:55,280
You can't even get a medium close-up.

364
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:58,360
I have to hit pause to find you in a scene.

365
00:22:58,720 --> 00:22:59,960
You're 25 already.

366
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:01,520
Yet you are still one of the extras.

367
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,760
What are you thinking?

368
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:05,840
Once

369
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:07,120
I have a goal in life,

370
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:08,560
I have the courage

371
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:10,320
and an inexhaustible passion to achieve it.

372
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:12,360
You're four years older than me.

373
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:14,160
Let's talk about what you've achieved in life.

374
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,280
Yes, Xiaoyu.

375
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,840
I opened a coffee shop.

376
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:23,160
But then it went out of business.

377
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:25,680
How come?

378
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:28,680
Business

379
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:30,360
is complicated.

380
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:32,600
Come on.

381
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:33,880
Stop with those

382
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:35,760
empty excuses, alright?

383
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:38,000
Running a business is hard work.

384
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:38,760
But you're always sleeping.

385
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:40,560
How can you work day and night on business?

386
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:41,280
Yeah.

387
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:42,680
I can't get up early.

388
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:43,480
I can't stay up late.

389
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:44,880
Sis.

390
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:45,760
I admire you.

391
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:46,400
I really do.

392
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,800
You've always kept the virtue

393
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:50,720
of being lazy.

394
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:53,440
You just have to slap me right in the face, right?

395
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:55,400
No way! Your face is too pretty.

396
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:56,640
I don't have the heart to slap you.

397
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:57,240
Let me kiss you.

398
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:58,120
Come on.

399
00:23:58,120 --> 00:23:59,720
Stop it.

400
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:00,720
Just eat.

401
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:03,360
You were like this when you were kids,

402
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:05,480
always arguing when you were together.

403
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:07,360
The big sister

404
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:08,840
had to be the best in every aspect.

405
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:10,080
The little one

406
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,320
always messed around.

407
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:14,760
Xiaoyu couldn't win an argument with Bao Xue

408
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:17,040
so she'd use fists instead of words.

409
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:21,640
Then Bao Xue would jump around like a monkey.

410
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,440
But she's someone

411
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,920
who never learns.

412
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:27,720
She'd follow you around

413
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:28,880
calling you sis

414
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,280
when you were

415
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:31,560
still mad.

416
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:33,720
When did that ever happen?

417
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:35,280
I don't remember it.

418
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:36,880
Stop it.

419
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:39,400
Your brain is like a giant sieve.

420
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:40,640
Yeah.

421
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,440
I only remember the useful things.

422
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:26,080
You Shanshan?

423
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,360
Are you You Shanshan?

424
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:31,000
You are...

425
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,560
I was on the flight to Lhasa on 14th May.

426
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:35,720
It's you!

427
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:36,600
That girl...

428
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:37,920
Which girl?

429
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:39,360
Yeah, I'm Si Meng.

430
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:40,960
What a coincidence! You live in the neighborhood?

431
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:43,080
No, I just shop here often.

432
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:44,400
I've been meaning to thank you.

433
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,040
If you hadn't consoled me and talked to me,

434
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:47,400
I would've been falling apart.

435
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:48,920
Don't mention it.

436
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:50,240
We're of similar age,

437
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:51,560
but clearly, you haven't gone through

438
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:52,600
as much as I did.

439
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:54,640
You gave me a chance to be the big sister.

440
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:56,920
You can go before me.

441
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:59,240
I can't do that. There are so many people behind you.

442
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:00,360
I'll use my card.

443
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:15,640
I thought we'd agreed to it.

444
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:20,280
Just give me 10% more of the share, okay?

445
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,560
Whose purse is it?

446
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:25,080
Who left a purse here?

447
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:29,400
Let me see. It seems to be my friend's purse.

448
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:32,520
I'll take it. Thanks.

449
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:34,120
You Shanshan.

450
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:36,400
You Shanshan!

451
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:37,240
I'll give you

452
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:38,880
more share in the next project.

453
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:40,200
You Shanshan.

454
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:42,440
You Shanshan!

455
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:21,600
I've refilled your glass for you.

456
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:22,160
Okay.

457
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:44,000
Drive me back to the firm first.

458
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:44,800
Okay.

459
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:46,360
You Shanshan!

460
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:50,920
What are you doing here?

461
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:52,640
Did you lose something?

462
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:54,000
Is this yours?

463
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:57,400
You were so careless.

464
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:59,840
I didn't even realize that I lost my purse.

465
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:01,520
Check if everything is in there.

466
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:02,240
There's no need.

467
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:04,160
You wouldn't bring it to me if anything is missing.

468
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:07,400
Thanks.

469
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,240
You helped me last time.

470
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:10,440
I helped you today.

471
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:12,480
I have repaid your favor.

472
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:14,080
Are you free now?

473
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:15,080
Yes.

474
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:18,360
You must be busier than me.

475
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:20,080
That depends on how you see it.

476
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:22,120
Sometimes, I've got my plate full all day.

477
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:23,960
Sometimes, I don't have anything to do.

478
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:25,480
You, on the contrary,

479
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:26,560
need to do all the housework

480
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:27,880
while raising two kids.

481
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:29,320
You must be busy all the time.

482
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:31,680
Thanks for understanding.

483
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:35,760
I went to Lhasa to sponsor a charity event.

484
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:36,880
Why did you go there?

485
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:38,240
Don't get me started.

486
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:40,440
My parents insisted on driving to Lhasa themselves.

487
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:42,800
They're so cool!

488
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:44,840
But my mom was hit by AMS the minute she got there

489
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:46,120
and ended up in a hospital.

490
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:47,600
I was worried sick.

491
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:49,480
So I decided to book a ticket and fly there.

492
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:52,080
Unfortunately, the tickets for that day were sold out.

493
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:53,120
So, I booked the flight to Lhasa

494
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:54,760
that transferred from Chengdu.

495
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:56,160
Are they alright?

496
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:57,560
They are.

497
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:58,880
But I almost died.

498
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,840
Seriously, looking at you now,

499
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:05,280
I can recall how scared you were the other day.

500
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:06,040
I really can.

501
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:07,920
You cried so hard that your eyes were swollen.

502
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:09,200
You wouldn't listen to me at all.

503
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:11,360
I was like, "Stop crying, girl.

504
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:13,080
Just leave it to fate."

505
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:14,840
I didn't want to cry,

506
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:16,040
but I was too scared.

507
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:17,960
My legs kept shaking the whole time, you know?

508
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:19,720
I admire you.

509
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:21,960
How did you manage to stay calm in danger?

510
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:24,560
I've experienced all that life has to offer.

511
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:26,040
It wouldn't be such a pity

512
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:27,160
if I just dropped dead

513
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:28,280
without having to suffer.

514
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:29,560
In 18 years,

515
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:30,840
I'd come back a new man in my next life.

516
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:31,920
Right.

517
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:33,360
That is exactly what you said to me.

518
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:35,160
I felt much more relaxed

519
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:36,560
after hearing those words.

520
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:39,480
It's lunchtime.

521
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,080
Let's have lunch together.

522
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,760
My washing machine has been acting up.

523
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:43,960
I'm having it repaired this afternoon.

524
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:45,080
I need to go back and wait for the repairman.

525
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:48,760
I thought you had something important!

526
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:50,280
I know

527
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:52,600
a repairperson for washing machines.

528
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:53,800
He's an expert.

529
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:55,640
He'll fix your washing machine for good.

530
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:57,400
Who is he? Recommend him to me.

531
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:01,480
Cancel your appointment

532
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:02,280
and give me your address.

533
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:03,640
I'll ask him to go there now.

534
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:05,000
I'll go with you.

535
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:06,600
You want to come with me?

536
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:08,400
Don't you have to work?

537
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:12,680
It's a bit awkward to say it out loud

538
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:14,920
but I own the whole firm,

539
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:16,720
so no one's checking my attendance.

540
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:20,280
It's so good to be a boss.

541
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:21,880
I'll cancel it then.

542
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:22,600
Yeah.

543
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:28,520
Granny!

544
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:33,040
What are you making? Smells so good!

545
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:34,840
Red-braised pork, your favorite.

546
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,040
Great.

547
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:39,200
I'll cook the eggplant, then we're good to go.

548
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,240
Okay.

549
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:42,680
Granny, where is Xiaoyu?

550
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:44,840
Still sleeping.

551
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:48,000
Still?

552
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,080
She doesn't go to bed at night

553
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:50,280
and doesn't get up in the morning.

554
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:51,880
Every day at noon,

555
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:53,600
she gets out of her bed

556
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,000
after I put lunch on the table.

557
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:56,240
After lunch,

558
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:58,200
she just leaves the dirty dishes in the sink.

559
00:31:58,280 --> 00:31:59,760
Leave them.

560
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:00,680
Just ignore them

561
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:01,640
and wait for her to do the dishes.

562
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:03,040
Then, I might have to wait

563
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:05,440
until the dishes are covered in mold.

564
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:07,320
She's unbearable!

565
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:09,040
Wait here.

566
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:10,480
I'll get her out of bed.

567
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:24,400
What?

568
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:27,320
You're having sweet dreams

569
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:29,520
while granny is doing all the work!

570
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:31,800
Older people need less sleep.

571
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:33,720
I'm still young.

572
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:35,040
I need to sleep.

573
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:39,000
Then, don't sleep before her eyes.

574
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:39,960
Rent an apartment

575
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:41,160
and move out!

576
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:44,880
A decent one-bedroom apartment

577
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,880
costs 5-6,000 yuan per month.

578
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:48,600
I don't even have a job.

579
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:50,760
How can I afford that, sis?

580
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,400
Still, you can't ask granny

581
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:54,560
to shoulder your burdens.

582
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:58,680
My last name is Dai.

583
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,480
My dad's her son.

584
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:02,200
When I have nowhere else to turn,

585
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:04,440
it makes sense that I turn to the Dai family.

586
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:06,720
Come on.

587
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:09,680
I thought you've cut ties with your dad.

588
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:11,960
And your dad cut ties with his mother.

589
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:13,320
So, tell me,

590
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:15,080
What part of it

591
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:16,240
makes sense?

592
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:20,680
You're just jealous of me

593
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:22,120
'cause you can't take any advantages.

594
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:24,560
I am jealous? Me?

595
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:28,480
Tell you what.

596
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:30,360
There are a lot of things you don't know.

597
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,720
I didn't know them either at first.

598
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:34,320
But granny told me.

599
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:35,560
Great stories.

600
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:42,040
When I graduated middle school,

601
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:43,320
I wasn't a registered resident in Beijing,

602
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:44,800
so I couldn't take the college entry exams here.

603
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:46,960
Therefore, I went back to Shenzhen for high school.

604
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:48,960
Then I got into the Central Academy of Drama

605
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,720
and have been living in Beijing since graduation.

606
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:53,640
My mom asked me to move in here

607
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:55,240
and keep granny company.

608
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:58,560
Then, your dad got furious with my mom

609
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:00,240
'cause he thought

610
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:01,640
my dad was after granny's house

611
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:03,240
so he wanted me here as a placeholder.

612
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:05,920
My dad was mad as a hornet.

613
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:06,920
Just think about

614
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:08,560
how over the line your dad was.

615
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:11,639
What does all this

616
00:34:11,639 --> 00:34:12,960
have to do with me?

617
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:16,480
You just said you belong to the Dai family.

618
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:19,480
We're totally different people.

619
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:21,760
Although he made a scene, I can still live here.

620
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:23,000
Oh, now

621
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,320
you want to deny connections with him.

622
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:28,360
Dai Xiaoyu. I think

623
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:30,920
you really are like my uncle.

624
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:34,080
You were born selfish, weren't you?

625
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:36,040
Say that again!

626
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:38,840
I will step up and fight against you,

627
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:41,560
you pathetic egoist!

628
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:42,800
I'll say it 100 times more.

629
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:45,400
Dai Xiaoyu, you're a selfish and pathetic egoist.

630
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:48,120
Spare the rod, spoil the child!

631
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:49,679
Granny!

632
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:51,480
Dai Xiaoyu! You're a selfish

633
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:52,480
and pathetic egoist!

634
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:53,280
Stop!

635
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:53,679
You are...

636
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:54,199
I will not stop.

637
00:34:54,199 --> 00:34:55,320
Say that again!

638
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:56,480
Stop right there.

639
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:57,600
Dai Xiaoyu! Help!

640
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:58,480
You blabbermouth!

641
00:34:58,480 --> 00:34:59,480
Granny!

642
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:00,960
Granny, help!

643
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:01,720
Granny!

644
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:03,040
Do you have nothing else to do?

645
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:04,200
Stop messing around!

646
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:05,880
Set the table for dinner.

647
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:08,000
Granny told us to set the table!

648
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,280
Out of my way.

649
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:10,240
You get out of my way.

650
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:16,800
The eggplant smells so good.

651
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:19,480
Granny, she just kicked me.

652
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:20,840
Are you hurt?

653
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:26,960
The hot and sour soup granny made

654
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:30,040
tastes better than that in any restaurant.

655
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:31,920
Then have some more.

656
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:34,600
You eat less than a kitten every day to lose weight.

657
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:36,080
You'll get sick.

658
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,000
Don't mind her, grandma.

659
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:39,680
I'll have some.

660
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:40,800
I don't need to lose weight.

661
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,080
That's true.

662
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:44,000
But you only have one meal a day.

663
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:45,920
If Xue didn't come here,

664
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:48,480
your first meal would be dinner.

665
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:50,040
Grandma.

666
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:52,080
I'm still jet-lagged.

667
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:53,360
You?

668
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:55,200
Just admit that you like to sleep in.

669
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:56,960
Stop blaming it on jet lag.

670
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:58,560
The time difference is only 6 hours.

671
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:00,160
Are you serious?

672
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:01,280
Yes, I am.

673
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:02,320
I am very tired.

674
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:03,680
Granny.

675
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:05,800
She's planning to stay here forever.

676
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:08,000
You should be careful.

677
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,080
Be sure to

678
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:10,840
hide the deed, your gold,

679
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:12,440
and the precious

680
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:13,600
jade bracelet.

681
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:15,080
All joking aside,

682
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:17,640
I won't rush you since you're still jet-lagged.

683
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:20,360
But you can't stay at home

684
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:22,920
and sleep all day.

685
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:24,280
How will you get anything done like that?

686
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:27,560
I want to do something.

687
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:29,360
But I need to do it one step at a time.

688
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:31,480
Take the first step, then.

689
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:32,840
You've got so many excuses.

690
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:33,840
Granny.

691
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:35,520
Don't make dinner for her tonight.

692
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:37,360
I'll take her out to dinner to shut her up.

693
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:38,880
I'm not going.

694
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:39,800
It's too much work.

695
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:41,760
See?

696
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:43,600
That's not an excuse.

697
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,200
You have to go.

698
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:46,920
You have to go.

699
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,240
My house is a bit messy.

700
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:54,520
Hope you don't mind.

701
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:56,680
That's what it's like to have kids.

702
00:36:56,680 --> 00:36:57,800
It's always messy.

703
00:36:58,360 --> 00:36:59,480
Such a big apartment

704
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:00,920
in this premium location.

705
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:03,680
Your husband must make a lot of money.

706
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:04,880
Well, he's alright.

707
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:07,080
He's a partner in an accounting firm.

708
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:08,560
It pays well.

709
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,720
We live here because of the kids.

710
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:11,920
It's close to their school.

711
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:14,440
That must be the repairman.

712
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:19,040
Hello.

713
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:20,440
May I ask for You Shanshan?

714
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:21,400
It's me.

715
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:23,000
You're fast.

716
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:25,000
What is all this?

717
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,480
I thought they're here to repair it?

718
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:29,440
Replacement is the most effective way of repairing.

719
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:31,840
I've seen this model before.

720
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:32,920
It's super expensive.

721
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:33,840
That's the latest model, right?

722
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:34,280
Yeah.

723
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:36,480
You need to pick the expensive ones

724
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:37,760
for stuff you use a lot.

725
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:39,080
Spare no expense.

726
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:40,440
Ours is pretty expensive already.

727
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:42,000
Then it's not expensive enough.

728
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:43,440
Where do you want it?

729
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:44,600
Get it in first.

730
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:45,280
Inside.

731
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:46,880
Over there.

732
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,480
Careful.

733
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:53,480
Here is fine.

734
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:54,600
Okay.

735
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:57,000
Thank you.

736
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:59,360
You're really something.

737
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:00,160
How much is it?

738
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:01,120
I'll transfer the money.

739
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:02,480
Don't!

740
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:03,960
Consider it a gift.

741
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:05,040
No way!

742
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:06,160
I can't let you pay for it.

743
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:06,760
Are you kidding?

744
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:08,800
Stop it.

745
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:10,560
Do you know how much time

746
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:12,560
you've saved me by returning my purse?

747
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:13,800
Two weeks.

748
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:15,000
Do you know how much money

749
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,040
I can make in two weeks?

750
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:17,360
How much? I'd love to know.

751
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:21,000
Well, way more than what that washing machine costs.

752
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:23,520
So, just take it.

753
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:26,000
Although we've only met twice,

754
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,120
we did go through moments of life and death together.

755
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:28,240
Right?

756
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:29,960
Just take the gift if you think of me as a friend.

757
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:31,440
I feel bad.

758
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:32,240
I can't ask you to pay for it.

759
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:33,840
Stop it.

760
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:34,480
Seriously,

761
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:35,400
I am starving now.

762
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:36,880
Can you get me something to eat?

763
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:38,000
Of course.

764
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,080
One sec.

765
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:39,840
You're unbelievable.

766
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:41,840
You kept it from me all this time!

767
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:45,160
Now you know why I don't want you

768
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:47,360
to mention it in front of grandma.

769
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:52,800
How are you feeling now?

770
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:54,200
Still upset?

771
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:56,680
I'd be lying

772
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:57,920
if I say I'm not upset.

773
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:00,240
But I'm alright.

774
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:02,880
I'm stronger than I thought I'd be.

775
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:05,240
When I first knew it,

776
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:07,720
I thought I'd cry all day

777
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:09,120
for a long time.

778
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:13,000
But on my flight back,

779
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,280
I kept telling myself

780
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:16,520
that I made the right decision,

781
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:18,800
that I had to do this.

782
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:21,000
Once I started to see it that way,

783
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:23,240
I felt at ease.

784
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:30,560
The only thing I couldn't get over

785
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:33,080
is that I feel

786
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:33,960
I've wasted

787
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:36,240
all of my youthful years.

788
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:38,320
I feel sorry for myself...

789
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:42,760
Come on.

790
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:45,600
What?

791
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:48,760
My shoulder is broad.

792
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:50,280
You can lean on it.

793
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:55,120
Your shoulder is everything but broad.

794
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:56,600
It hurts!

795
00:39:58,160 --> 00:39:58,600
What?

796
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:00,000
You don't want my shoulder?

797
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,520
Then, I'll find someone else for you.

798
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:02,840
Thank you.

799
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:05,240
If there really is someone reliable, 
keep him for yourself.

800
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:08,560
Ungrateful.

801
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:11,440
It's so intelligent.

802
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:13,440
And they say money can't buy everything.

803
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:15,960
Seriously,

804
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:17,840
it's so good.

805
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:20,200
You can be a chef.

806
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,480
Practice makes perfect.

807
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:23,560
If you like it so much.

808
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:25,320
you're always welcome to come eat with us.

809
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,520
Then, I'd get so fat.

810
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:28,560
Is that enough?

811
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:29,440
There's more in the pot.

812
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:30,680
I'll get you more.

813
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:31,880
That's enough.

814
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:34,280
My stomach is about to explode.

815
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:36,520
It's been too long
 since I last had this big bowl of noodles.

816
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:38,200
I haven't asked you.

817
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:39,840
What does your firm do?

818
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:41,960
Anything that makes money.

819
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:43,200
Still holding out on me, are you?

820
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:45,960
I'm not.

821
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:47,080
I'm an investor.

822
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:49,000
So I invest in whatever is profitable.

823
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:51,400
I've recently just invested in this company

824
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:53,680
that does cloud storage and other services.

825
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:55,760
Yeah, everything is on the cloud now.

826
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:57,280
You can raise a plant,

827
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:58,040
raise a cat,

828
00:40:58,040 --> 00:40:59,400
or even find a partner on the cloud.

829
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:01,240
Find a partner on the cloud?

830
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:03,840
We don't have that service.

831
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:05,080
Well, you'd better not.

832
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:06,120
It might be borderline

833
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:07,120
pornography.

834
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:10,200
You're quite funny.

835
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:11,960
You are not like

836
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:12,920
most of the housewives

837
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:14,160
that I know.

838
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:15,760
I saw that

839
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:16,760
there are many books

840
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:18,560
in your den.

841
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:20,080
I seriously doubt

842
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:22,080
that you're one of those intellects

843
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:23,400
that got sidetracked by housework.

844
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:24,920
What intellect?

845
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:26,400
I only have a bachelor's degree.

846
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:27,520
Even postgraduates dare not say

847
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:29,080
they're intellects.

848
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,000
Where did you graduate?

849
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:32,760
What's your major?

850
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:35,320
I majored in Chinese at Beijing Normal University.

851
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:36,000
What about you?

852
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:38,160
Me?

853
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:41,520
Economics, UIBE.

854
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:42,880
I dropped out.

855
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:43,800
Dropped out?

856
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:45,680
Why didn't you finish your degree?

857
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:48,120
I was stupid.

858
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:49,680
I fell in love

859
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:51,760
in my freshman year.

860
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:53,640
I was misguided by those

861
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:54,760
lovey-dovey stories.

862
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:55,360
Sophomore year,

863
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:57,080
I was adamant about getting married.

864
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:57,920
Senior year,

865
00:41:58,560 --> 00:41:59,240
I got pregnant.

866
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:00,920
Then I dropped out to have a baby.

867
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:03,560
Then your kid must be big now.

868
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:05,760
12 years old.

869
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:06,920
I couldn't even tell

870
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:08,080
that you're also a mom.

871
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:11,000
What does your husband do?

872
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,320
Nothing.

873
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:13,840
He just idles around.

874
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:15,280
And you're not fighting with him?

875
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:17,640
Well,

876
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:19,480
we got divorced.

877
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:23,360
That's too much information.

878
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:25,200
I think we were never prepared

879
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:26,360
to get married in the first place,

880
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:28,160
let alone become parents.

881
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:31,600
Tell you what, ever since I married into his family,

882
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:33,080
things have been weird.

883
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:35,080
His mother was so on guard against me.

884
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:36,680
She'd tell people

885
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:38,800
that I got pregnant so that I could keep her son.

886
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:41,160
Since I wasn't originally from here,

887
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:43,760
she thought I was looking for a patron
 to stay in the big city.

888
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:45,040
I had argued with her

889
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:46,560
over this several times.

890
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:47,920
But not once did Shi Daming...

891
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:49,600
Shi Daming is my ex.

892
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:51,200
Not once was he on my side.

893
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:52,160
Why?

894
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:55,360
Because his mother is in charge of

895
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:56,560
the family fortune.

896
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:59,240
He has to ask her for every cent he's spending.

897
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:01,400
Then,

898
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:02,920
after our child was born,

899
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:05,040
I put up with him for two more years.

900
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:07,440
We even had to ask his mother

901
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:09,360
for money to buy baby formula.

902
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:12,200
I couldn't live like that anymore.

903
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:13,440
So, I filed for divorce.

904
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:15,160
And he agreed to it?

905
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:16,240
He didn't,

906
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:18,200
but his mother did.

907
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:19,960
Because back then,

908
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:21,800
his mother wanted to set him up with this girl

909
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:23,640
who is the daughter of her boss.

910
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:25,680
She saw the divorce

911
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:27,880
as an opportunity.

912
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:29,680
So, she said to me,

913
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:31,480
"Shanshan,

914
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:34,360
you two are not meant for each other.

915
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:36,560
You're too good for my son."

916
00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:38,320
She's unbelievable.

917
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:40,120
She asked her son to give me a sum of money.

918
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:41,720
I didn't take it.

919
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:44,680
Are you still in touch with each other?

920
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:45,680
Yes.

921
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:47,640
I used to take my son to travel

922
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:49,120
when I had time.

923
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:51,120
I'm now planning to send my son abroad.

924
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:54,120
Do you hate his mother?

925
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:55,640
There was a time

926
00:43:55,640 --> 00:43:57,280
when I would gnash my teeth

927
00:43:57,280 --> 00:43:58,720
even mentioning her.

928
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:01,640
But later on,

929
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:02,920
I learned something about her

930
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:05,080
and my hatred went away.

931
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:08,280
What about her that caused this 180-degree change?

932
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:14,560
I have a friend who's a nurse.

933
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:16,640
I had my baby

934
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:18,280
in her hospital.

935
00:44:19,120 --> 00:44:22,240
She said that I was having a heart failure
 caused by obstructed labor.

936
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:23,840
They asked a family member to sign a paper

937
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:25,960
and decide who to save if anything happened.

938
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:28,120
My mother-in-law decided to save me
 without hesitation.

939
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:32,960
I cried

940
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:34,520
when I heard about it.

941
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:38,520
And I couldn't hate her anymore.

942
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:44,640
Then, my firm got bigger and bigger.

943
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:46,640
I didn't have time or the energy

944
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:48,120
to fixate on the past.

945
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:51,840
You really are a person with stories.

946
00:44:53,120 --> 00:44:55,240
I write stories on the internet sometimes.

947
00:44:55,560 --> 00:44:56,480
If you don't mind,

948
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:58,280
can I write about your experience?

949
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:04,080
Turns out that you've been chatting with me

950
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:06,240
for writing material.

951
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:08,400
I honestly think you've got a great story to tell.

952
00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:10,160
If it ever gets published,

953
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:11,360
I'll cut you in on the royalty.

954
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:12,360
No need.

955
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:14,880
I know that you writers don't make much.

956
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:16,600
The money won't do me any good.

957
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:17,960
How about this?

958
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:21,280
If it gets published,

959
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:22,720
you can buy me dinner.

960
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:23,920
That's all you want?

961
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:25,160
How about this?

962
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:26,440
My husband has a social tonight.

963
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:28,080
If you're available, wait till I pick up the kids

964
00:45:28,080 --> 00:45:29,280
and we can have dinner together.

965
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:31,400
I'll buy you dinner now,

966
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:32,760
regardless if the story gets published or not.

967
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:34,520
I'm not being polite

968
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:35,320
but I've got plans tonight.

969
00:45:35,320 --> 00:45:36,680
I need to go back to the firm.

970
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:38,480
Then, I need to attend this dinner.

971
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:39,560
I need to go home to change.

972
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:40,760
Well.

973
00:45:40,760 --> 00:45:41,800
If you're free tonight,

974
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:43,920
you can take your kids and join us.

975
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,360
Maybe another time.

976
00:45:46,360 --> 00:45:48,040
The kids need to do homework.

977
00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:49,160
You know that I've got more things

978
00:45:49,160 --> 00:45:50,560
going on than you.

979
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:52,360
Okay. Keep in touch.

980
00:45:52,360 --> 00:45:53,080
Bye.

981
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:55,160
Well, you know where I live now.

982
00:45:55,160 --> 00:45:56,680
You're welcome to drop by anytime.

983
00:45:57,160 --> 00:45:58,760
It is fate that

984
00:45:58,760 --> 00:45:59,920
brought us together.

985
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:01,840
Thank you for the washing machine.

986
00:46:01,840 --> 00:46:03,200
I will transfer the money to you later.

987
00:46:03,560 --> 00:46:04,880
Stop mentioning it!

988
00:46:06,080 --> 00:46:07,600
Bye-bye.

989
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:09,320
Drive safe.

990
00:46:09,320 --> 00:46:10,080
Okay.
