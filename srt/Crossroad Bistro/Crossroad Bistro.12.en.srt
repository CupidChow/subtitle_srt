00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:01,880
What about that picture?

5
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,560
Where were you?

6
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,520
I was in the U.S.

7
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,880
I really admire people like you

8
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:14,240
who dare to risk your lives.

9
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,680
Extreme sports are so dangerous.

10
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,079
You guys would just climb a cliff

11
00:02:19,079 --> 00:02:20,400
without any protection.

12
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,240
Any moss on the rock

00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,520
or any loose rock

14
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,720
may cost you your life.

15
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,640
I want to interview you.

16
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,280
Why do you do that?

17
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,600
Aren't you scared?

18
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,800
I'll be lying if I say I'm not.

19
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,280
But what I'm more scared of

20
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,360
is a boring life.

21
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
There's so much fun in life.

22
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:48,160
Why is it only fun when you risk your life?

23
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:48,960
See?

24
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,240
We have different

25
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,440
cognitive styles.

26
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,400
Do you know that extreme circumstances

27
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:56,079
can unlock your potential?

28
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:57,600
I see.

29
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,920
For example,

30
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:02,160
if a tiger was after me,

31
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:03,960
I would run faster than Bolt.

32
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:04,920
Am I right?

33
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,120
How smart you are!

34
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,800
Thank you.

35
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:12,480
It was so easy for our ancestors

36
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:13,880
to climb up and down a cliff.

37
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,200
It's just

38
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,480
that we regress in this regard.

39
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,360
Nevertheless,

40
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,400
we don't just do it. We train ourselves

41
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,800
in a scientific way.

42
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,079
I want to challenge myself

43
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:25,040
physically and psychologically,

44
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,280
instead of staying in my comfort zone.

45
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:30,280
When you have finally made a breakthrough,

46
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,040
conquered a cliff,

47
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,360
and stand on the edge of it,

48
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,280
you'll just feel…

49
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,960
What?

50
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,280
Awesome.

51
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,280
I just can't feel it.

52
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,920
I still think it's scary.

53
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,480
Listen.

54
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:52,079
The utmost danger in the world

55
00:03:52,079 --> 00:03:53,760
is your fear inside.

56
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,520
Once you overcome your inner fear

57
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,640
and take that first step,

58
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:58,800
you'll be safe.

59
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,840
Let me give you an example.

60
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:03,560
Let's see snowboard carving.

61
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:04,840
As long as you shift your weight

62
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:07,000
to the side of the cliff,

63
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,800
you can easily switch between the edges

64
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:10,400
while staying safe.

65
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:11,720
This is just mechanics.

66
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:14,400
You can't do it because you fear it.

67
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,120
Therefore, you'll fall harder.

68
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,640
Here's another example.

69
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,880
Free climbing.

70
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,000
When you train on the ground,

71
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,720
your arm span

72
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,120
and arm strength all seem good.

73
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:33,000
But why can't you do it

74
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,720
when you're climbing on the cliff?

75
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,360
It's also because of your fear.

76
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,920
Overcoming your fear

77
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,040
and pushing yourself to your limits

78
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,840
make you much happier

79
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,960
than making money and living in a big house.

80
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,400
If you're right,

81
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,680
then why are there so many accidents

82
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,600
each year around the world?

83
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,159
Are they all because of fear?

84
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,640
Not all of them.

85
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:59,159
If you come across loose rocks,

86
00:04:59,159 --> 00:05:00,000
then it's your destiny.

87
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:02,480
It has the same odds of you being hit by a car.

88
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:09,440
People choose different ways of life.

89
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,040
Some prefer an easy life.

90
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,240
Others like adventures.

91
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,560
It's just that people are different.

92
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:20,760
In fact,

93
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:21,840
I'm not the kind of person

94
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,920
who sticks to the rules.

95
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,000
To be honest,

96
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:27,720
before I knew you,

97
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:30,040
I thought I am the most daring person.

98
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:32,800
But after what you said, I feel

99
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,600
that I may have misunderstood

100
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,840
the word "daring".

101
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,360
If you're interested,

102
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,520
let's go and have some fun tomorrow.

103
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,080
Don't worry.

104
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:42,120
I'll make sure that you're safe.

105
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:51,920

106
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,680

109
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,480
Are you crazy?

110
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:15,200
The next turn is the most thrilling one.

111
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,520
We had a good one today.

112
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:47,280
What do you think?

113
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,120
Was it exciting?

114

What, you feel sick?

117
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,240
Did you throw up?

118
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,720
No, but almost.

119

She didn't throw up on you, did she?

120

No.

121
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,640
Thank god.

122
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,400
I'm afraid if I move my hand,

123
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,240
my heart will jump out of my mouth.

124
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,560
Alright. It can't be that bad.

125
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,240
Get down.

126
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:14,120
Come on.

127
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,960
Don't. Don't touch me.

128
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:17,720
My legs are numb. I need a few minutes.

129
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,720
Let me see what you've got in your camera.

130
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,840
What are these?

131
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:30,320
It's just you shouting.

132
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:31,480
Is it a horror movie?

133
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:33,960
Do you expect me to take your pictures?

134
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,400
I was too busy worrying about my life.

135
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,480
You scared the hell out of me.

136
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:38,840
Do you know

137
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:40,159
that from my viewpoint,

138
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:41,200
you almost fell off the cliff?

139
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:44,320
You were just this close to the edge.

140
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,040
If you had not been careful enough,

141
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:47,400
you could have just died.

142
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,520
This is the game of brave men.

143
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:51,200
We have been trained.

144
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,920
And we've practiced here many times.

145
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:54,320
Rest assured.

146
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:55,760
I'm safe.

147
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,120
It is very rare

148
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,560
that any danger happens.

149
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,440
Right?

150
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:01,240
Fine.

151
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,360
I surrender.

152
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,080
I mean it.

153
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:04,680
If you do this again,

154
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:05,600
just don't drag me in.

155
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:08,800
I don't want to witness any tragedy.

156
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:12,400
Are you afraid of losing me?

157
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,400
Whatever you think.

158
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,960
If anything happens to you, no one will send me home.

159
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:20,680
We still have Yaming.

160
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:21,320
Come on.

161
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,240
Yaming,

162
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:23,840
do you need a girlfriend?

163
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,240
Of course.

164
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,520
I'll tell your wife.

165
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,480
May I interview you,

166
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,520
my hero?

167
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,240
Do you have anything else

168
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,800
that you haven't told me?

169
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,360
You must be honest.

170
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:47,200
The other day, when I went to Tianjin to watch a play,

171
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,760
I robbed two banks on my way.

172
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:50,880
After the play,

173
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:53,400
I kidnapped a young lady.

174
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,520
But so far, I haven't decided

175
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,800
whether to kill her or keep her?

176
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,440
Hello? Is it Inspector Black Cat?

177
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,360
I have a big mouse in my car.

178
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,640
I'm talking him into turning himself in.

179
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,600
Please bring with you

180
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,680
a big cage, heavy leg irons,

181
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:12,840
tiger bench, and pepper spray.

182
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,160
After all the torture,

183
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,280
he'll definitely confess his sins.

184
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,400
Why bother?

185
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,920
Just seduce me with your beauty
 and I'll confess anything.

186
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,640
You wish.

187
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:23,880
Or should I seduce you?

188
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:35,680
Thank you.

189
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,280
Thank you, Mr. Li, for your trust.

190
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:42,960
This is just our job.

191
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:43,680
Alright.

192
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:44,320
Sure.

193
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,160
See you.

194
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,120
Mr. Du, here's your lunch.

195
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:47,920
Why is it you?

196
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:48,720
Where's Zhao?

197
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,120
He's on leave today.

198
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:54,960
The Administration Department 
has made some progress.

199
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:57,040
We can even have sushi for lunch now.

200
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:04,720
Mr. Du.

201
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:10,600
Mr. Du.

202
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,040
Is the contract with New Century ready?

203
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:12,560
Yes.

204
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:13,200
I'll need it this afternoon.

205
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:13,560
No problem.

206
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,160
Mr. Du.

207
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:16,680
The sushi is quite good, isn't it?

208
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:17,640
What sushi?

209
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,680
We have fish-flavored shredded pork
 and shredded potatoes.

210
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,440
Mr. Du.

211
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:45,920
Is it Mrs. Bai?

212
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,800
I'm at the market.

213
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:49,000
If you need anything,

214
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:49,680
I'll just buy you some.

215
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:50,680
No, thanks.

216
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,920
I have a stomachache.

217
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,360
When did it start?

218
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,600
Are you sweating?

219
00:11:58,640 --> 00:11:59,760
Just don't move,

220
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:00,480
Mrs. Bai.

221
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,640
Keep lying down.

222
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:04,360
I'm coming right away.

223
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,200
Change your shoes.

224
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:17,880
Don't talk.

225
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,040
You're not sweating.

226
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,120
What's wrong with me?

227
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,280
Don't scare me.

228
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:40,720
Does it hurt here?

229
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:41,680
Yes.

230
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,240
Does it hurt much?

231
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,120
It hurts because you're pressing it too hard.

232
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:48,760
I'm asking if your heart aches.

233
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,480
No.

234
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,880
Does your stomach ache?

235
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:53,880
My stomach

236
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,840
aches from time to time.

237
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,560
What's the matter?

238
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:01,720
Why are you so nervous?

239
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:03,440
Am I going to die?

240
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,120
Hmm…

241
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,160
What did you have for lunch?

242
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:11,680
Some leftovers from yesterday.

243
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:14,000
Maybe I didn't heat it thoroughly.

244
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:17,440
I've told you so many times.

245
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:21,200
Don't eat leftovers. No one forces you to.

246
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,240
Not only do leftovers

247
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:25,400
cause gastrointestinal symptoms,

248
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:26,760
but they also

249
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:28,800
produce aflatoxin

250
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:31,480
which may lead to cancer.

251
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:33,520
OK. I know.

252
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,520
Look at you.

253
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,440
As soon as you came in, you felt my pulse

254
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:38,680
and checked my heart.

255
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:39,640
People may think

256
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,200
I've got some serious disease.

257
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,280
I'm not joking.

258
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:44,800
When someone old

259
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,240
feels these symptoms,

260
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,800
it's likely to be a heart attack.

261
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:49,600
Does stomachache

262
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,960
have anything to do with a heart attack?

263
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:53,480
My big brother

264
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:55,440
died from this two years ago.

265
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,160
At that time,

266
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:00,000
he only felt that his stomach ached.

267
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,160
My nephew

268
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:02,880
made porridge for him.

269
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,400
But he didn't feel any better after having it.

270
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:05,560
It was winter.

271
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,200
But he kept sweating.

272
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,520
Even his sweater vest was wet.

273
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:12,840
At around 10:00 in the evening,

274
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:14,520
he found it difficult to breathe.

275
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,680
His family called the ambulance immediately.

276
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:17,800
But when they arrived at the hospital,

277
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,760
he was gone

278
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:21,240
before the doctors could save him.

279
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:23,840
That's why

280
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,760
I fear

281
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,680
that you might be in the same situation.

282
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,320
From now on,

283
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:31,920
if you ever feel like this again,

284
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:32,840
you should…

285
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:34,520
Come here.

286
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,400
Push your back

287
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:43,720
against the chair.

288
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,280
Let the chair

289
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,920
push up against your back.

290
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,440
When you do this,

291
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,960
if your heart still aches much,

292
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:54,480
call the ambulance immediately.

293
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,840
How are you feeling now?

294
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:00,760
I'm fine.

295
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:06,400
I'll make you some porridge.

296
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,440
Do you know how?

297
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,600
Porridge

298
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,120
is the only thing I can make.

299
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:14,560
Have you ever fished?

300
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:15,680
Yes.

301
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,040
But I never caught any fish.

302
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:19,800
If we catch one later, please don't get too excited.

303
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:21,400
People like to be quiet when they're fishing.

304
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,600
"Me and my motherland…"

305
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,520
Give me the bait.

306
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,600
We got one!

307
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,000
Quickly.

308
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:58,280
Here. Here.

309
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:00,760
Take it slow.

310
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:01,600
Be careful.

311
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,480
Alright. We can let it go.

312
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,560
You said you want to have fish for dinner.

313
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:11,360
I want salmon.

314
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,880
Is this salmon?

315
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:15,480
This is freshwater.

316
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:16,800
How do I find any salmon here?

317
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:17,880
You can't be serious.

318
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,640
Maybe I'm not a serious actress.

319
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:21,760
But I'm serious about making jokes.

320
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:24,680
I see.

321
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:31,840
Bye-bye, Fish.

322
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:39,280
Here.

323
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:41,840
Try it.

324
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:46,520
How is it?

325
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:48,600
To be honest,

326
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:49,680
when I took a bite,

327
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:50,840
I was thinking about nothing

328
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:52,680
but peace.

329
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:54,760
I feel that when I'm with you,

330
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:56,280
I'm not bothered by anything anymore.

331
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:57,480
Tell me.

332
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:58,960
Have you

333
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:01,280
secretly trained yourself to cook?

334
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:02,360
Or,

335
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:05,560
you have cooked for so many ex-girlfriends

336
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:07,319
and you're getting better and better?

337
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:09,359
I started to cook as young as seven.

338
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,680
My grandpa taught me how to cook.

339
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:13,880
He said that one has to learn how to cook.

340
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:15,599
A person who cooks

341
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:17,319
never worries about his meals.

342
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:21,839
I feel like I never lived.

343
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:24,280
He had been telling me a truth since I was a kid.

344
00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:26,880
Only when you're capable of taking care of yourself

345
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:29,840
will you be able to take care of others.

346
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,040
People who don't even love themselves

347
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:32,080
are incapable of loving someone else.

348
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,640
But there's another type of person.

349
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:35,440
They

350
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:37,320
only love themselves.

351
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:38,080
Let's put it this way.

352
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:41,200
People who love themselves
aren't necessarily capable of loving others.

353
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,640
But people who don't love themselves first

354
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:43,840
are incapable of loving anyone.

355
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,520
Are you going to work tomorrow?

356
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:49,160
Yes.

357
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:50,000
Why?

358
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:52,240
I can't wait for you to take me out again for fun.

359
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:55,760
Just wait for my call.

360
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:58,040
I need to finish the current project first.

361
00:17:58,280 --> 00:17:59,360
What have you been doing?

362
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:00,480
I'm designing a hotel.

363
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:03,040
A hotel?

364
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:06,760
Can I have a look?

365
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:09,280
Come.

366
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:22,880
I like it.

367
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,320
This is the Executive Lounge.

368
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:27,880
So cool.

369
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:29,840
This is a Presidential Suite.

370
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:31,560
Amazing.

371
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,920
Don't flatter me. This is just routine work.

372
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:37,880
Have you ever stayed in a Presidential Suite?

373
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:39,400
No.

374
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:40,520
You?

375
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:42,880
Me neither.

376
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:45,160
How could I ever have that privilege?

377
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:47,680
Only superstars stay in Presidential Suites.

378
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:50,600
And if they don't, people will laugh at them.

379
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:51,600
But if someone like me

380
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,880
stay in a Presidential Suite,

381
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:54,800
I'll be looked down upon, too.

382
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:57,080
You do it fair and square

383
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:58,200
with your own money.

384
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,320
Why would anyone have a negative opinion about that?

385
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:01,600
That's exactly why

386
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,160
people will despise me.

387
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:03,880
You see,

388
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:05,920
the superstars stay in Presidential Suites

389
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,480
as part of the crew's budget.

390
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,560
If I spend my own money to stay in a Presidential Suite,

391
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:11,360
I'll definitely be laughed at.

392
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,080
It seems that there is

393
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:14,920
a clear chain of disdain in your industry.

394
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:18,200
This is not

395
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,360
where the real contempt lies.

396
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:20,360
What else?

397
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,480
Let's not talk about the big shots.

398
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,200
Just take ordinary actors and actresses for example.

399
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,880
Theater actors look down upon film actors.

400
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,360
Film actors look down upon TV actors.

401
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:31,040
TV actors look down upon video influencers.

402
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:34,840
Then who makes the most money?

403
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,640
That is an interesting question.

404
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:38,560
In terms of income,

405
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:39,680
it's exactly the opposite.

406
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:40,800
Influencers

407
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,320
make the most money in the shortest time,

408
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,360
while theater actors

409
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:44,320
make the least.

410
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:45,760
But as far as I know,

411
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:48,800
only theater actors are true actors.

412
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:51,200
Absolutely.

413
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:55,840
Acting on a stage is the biggest challenge
 for an actor.

414
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:56,880
Just think about it.

415
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:58,560
A play usually lasts about one hour or two.

416
00:19:58,560 --> 00:19:59,320
There's no NG

417
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:01,040
or post-editing.

418
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:03,280
There's no room for mistakes.

419
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:04,840
What if you accidentally make a mistake?

420
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,160
In that case,

421
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:08,360
you must not let the audience notice it.

422
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:10,680
This is where you see

423
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:12,720
the real stuff of an actor.

424
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,280
That is indeed some real stuff.

425
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,600
I'm a theater actor.

426
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,680
What is it like in your industry?

427
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:24,200
Do you also have a chain of disdain?

428
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,000
Of course.

429
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:27,040
For example,

430
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:28,960
a hotel project

431
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:31,080
usually takes long and the profit is just average.

432
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,680
I can only get fully paid after the hotel opens.

433
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:36,200
I stay in this profession out of true love.

434
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:39,280
Hotel designers look down upon interior designers.

435
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,080
Interior designers

436
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,960
look down upon office designers.

437
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:46,840
Then who earns the most?

438
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Office designers, of course.

439
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:51,640
It's easy work and easy money.

440
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:52,680
And the projects usually don't take long.

441
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:57,080
I love theater.

442
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:59,680
You love designing hotels.

443
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:02,400
Give me five.

444
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:05,080
We are such a good match.

445
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:08,560
We both love what we do more than money.

446
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,320
But I also love money.

447
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:14,440
Then I'll stop pretending.

448
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:16,200
You love your job.

449
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:16,920
As well as money.

450
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:18,120
High five.

451
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:24,520
Mom.

452
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:28,680
Is Dad out for dinner again?

453
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:31,800
Yes. It's part of his job.

454
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:33,600
Then I will find a job in the future

455
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:36,480
where I can have the best food.

456
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:37,360
Good for you.

457
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:39,440
Then you must study hard.

458
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:40,960
I don't want to study.

459
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:41,800
Why?

460
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:43,760
Because Dad was an underachiever

461
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,320
and Mom was a straight-A student.

462
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:47,600
Who told you that?

463
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:48,840
My brother.

464
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:51,680
Your brother was joking.

465
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:52,880
Your dad was also a straight-A student.

466
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,720
Your brother is the only underachiever in our family.

467
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:57,200
I can hear you, alright?

468
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:57,880
Mom.

469
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:00,120
I want to be an underachiever, too.

470
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:01,880
Brother, give me five!

471
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,000
Then you definitely won't find a job

472
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,040
where you can make money and eat the best food.

473
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:11,880
OK. Thanks.

474
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,280
What would you like for lunch, Mr. Du?

475
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:14,800
Don't bother.

476
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,560
I'll take a lunchbox.

477
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:20,840
Thanks for the sushi you ordered the other day.

478
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:22,760
Did you like it?

479
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:24,720
I don't have a good stomach for it.

480
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,120
Then let me find you something else.

481
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:28,480
No, thanks.

482
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:29,520
Wei Lan,

483
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,480
do you have anything to say to me?

484
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:35,800
Sit.

485
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:40,000
Mr. Du,

486
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,040
my internship is going to end.

487
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:43,640
I love this firm.

488
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:45,320
I want to stay.

489
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:50,120
You'll be notified

490
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:52,000
after the HR evaluation is done.

491
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:53,600
They already talked to me.

492
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:55,280
I was rejected.

493
00:22:58,600 --> 00:22:59,480
Do you know why?

494
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,240
No, I don't.

495
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:11,560
This evaluation will have an impact on my career.

496
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,440
Could you please write me another one?

497
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:27,720
As far as I know,

498
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:30,640
during your internship,

499
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,960
you participated in the teambuilding

500
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,160
of the Audit Department, right?

501
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:34,920
Yes.

502
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,720
They invited me.

503
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:39,040
You also participated in the teambuilding

504
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:40,000
of the Consulting Department?

505
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:40,760
Is that correct?

506
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:43,280
They sent an email to all.

507
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:44,360
I assume anyone could go.

508
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:46,520
The result is

509
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:49,040
you didn't pass two of the four tests.

510
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:50,200
How do you think

511
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:52,280
I should re-write this evaluation report?

512
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:58,480
Mr. Du,

513
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:01,640
honestly, this is not a profession I'm passionate about.

514
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,560
But it's in great demand and therefore, 
there are plenty of positions out there.

515
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:07,000
I want to continue in this field.

516
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:08,800
If you chose your major

517
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:10,120
because of this,

518
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:13,040
then I think

519
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:16,800
you're probably not suitable for accounting.

520
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:19,560
If you don't like it,

521
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:20,680
you won't do it well.

522
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:22,600
Even if you haven't made mistakes so far,

523
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:23,720
it's just a matter of time.

524
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:25,480
In this profession,

525
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:27,520
a tiny mistake may send you to jail.

526
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:28,560
Do you understand?

527
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:31,480
I think the HR department made the right decision.

528
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:36,760
Does this world operate

529
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:38,600
according to your standards?

530
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,480
Not as huge as that.

531
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:41,920
It's just that each firm

532
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:43,960
has its own standards.

533
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:45,400
Did you easily pass

534
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,800
all exams in your life?

535
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:49,240
Not necessarily easy.

536
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:50,600
But I passed them.

537
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,720
And I never took an exam twice.

538
00:24:59,480 --> 00:24:59,800
Wei Lan,

539
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:01,000
you're a smart girl.

540
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:03,640
But as I see it,

541
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:06,080
you seem to invest more

542
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:08,280
in socializing.

543
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:10,880
Have you ever thought of investment banks?

544
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:12,720
They may suit you better than an accounting firm.

545
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:15,080
If you need,

546
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:16,320
I can make a recommendation.

547
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:20,000
Mr. Du,

548
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:22,400
I have another week to go here.

549
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:24,080
If I make some progress,

550
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:26,480
will you write a new evaluation report for me?

551
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:29,840
No.

552
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:32,400
I don't have any prejudice against you.

553
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:33,920
Don't take it personally.

554
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:36,160
I just truly believe

555
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:38,000
that you are not suitable for this job.

556
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:44,160
All right?

557
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:00,800
Have you seen Wu Qing?

558
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:01,640
No.

559
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:02,640
If you see her,

560
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:03,720
tell her I'm looking for her.

561
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:05,160
Have you talked

562
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:06,840
to Wei Lan, the intern?

563
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:10,400
She already knew the evaluation result.

564
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:13,040
So she was rejected?

565
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,720
This is not my own decision.

566
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,240
You gave her a "Pass", didn't you?

567
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:19,240
Never mind.

568
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:20,760
Only your signature matters.

569
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:23,320
Our signatures are nothing but punctuation marks.

570
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:33,840
Yongjie,

571
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,520
I'd like to hear your opinion.

572
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:38,640
Am I right or wrong?

573
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:41,240
There's nothing right or wrong

574
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:42,280
in this kind of decision.

575
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:43,120
Don't you think so?

576
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:50,920
Then can you tell me

577
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:53,480
your reason for letting her stay?

578
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:55,600
I just think

579
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:57,720
that she was fresh out of graduate school

580
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:58,880
hoping to land her first job.

581
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:00,800
She has just taken the first step in her life

582
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,360
and you're teaching her a lesson?

583
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:04,880
Can you just give her a chance to grow?

584
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:06,880
She's a nice girl

585
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,360
and has been getting along with us.

586
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:10,200
Yongjie, which do you think

587
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:12,880
is more important,

588
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,320
working skills or social skills?

589
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:15,760
I'm not saying she's not competent.

590
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:17,240
Allow me to finish.

591
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:18,720
It's not that she doesn't have skills.

592
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,720
But she doesn't use her skills right.

593
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:23,440
What are the most
important qualities for this profession?

594
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:25,560
Being down-to-earth and rigorous.

595
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:26,880
It's not just about networking.

596
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,480
You can neither harm the interests of clients

597
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:31,320
nor ignore professional ethics.

598
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:32,480
This is what we should know

599
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:33,160
from the first day we get into this business.

600
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:33,800
Do you agree?

601
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:37,040
If you forgive her for a small mistake today,

602
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:39,240
tomorrow she might undermine the clients' interests,

603
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:39,960
or even worse,

604
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:42,320
the ethics and reputation of the whole profession.

605
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,640
Then you're actually doing her no good.

606
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:46,240
You may harm all the peers in our profession.

607
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:50,640
In fact,

608
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,320
I never had a negative opinion about her.

609
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:54,040
What I believe

610
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:56,160
is that she's not suitable for this job.

611
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,080
Maybe I was still hesitating

612
00:27:59,080 --> 00:27:59,960
when you came in.

613
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:00,680
But now

614
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:02,440
I can tell you for sure

615
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:04,320
that I trust my decision.

616
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:06,080
Go back to your work.

617
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,320
Hello? Bao Xue.

618
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:23,320
What are you doing?

619
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:27,120
Do you have plans today?

620
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:30,960
Where's your sister?

621
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:36,040
You can come if you are both free.

622
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:41,080
I'm in the studio.

623
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:42,040
I have a shooting session today.

624
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:43,640
Do you want to know who's the model?

625
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:44,400
Who?

626
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,280
Zhang Yishan.

627
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:49,640
Are you serious?

628
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:51,040
Of course. Just come and see.

629
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:54,800
Can I take a picture with him?

630
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:59,360
He's my favorite actor!

631
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:00,400
Great.

632
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:01,400
Wait for us.

633
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:02,480
We're coming right away.

634
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:03,720
Alright. I'll wait for you.

635
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:04,280
See you.

636
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:05,240
Great. See you.

637
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:09,760
Sister!

638
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:12,960
Liu Liangzhou just called.

639
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,440
Do you know whose photos he will take today?

640
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:17,120
Zhang Yishan!

641
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:21,000
He's the best.

642
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:22,920
Sister, have you seen any of his TV series?

643
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:23,760
His smiles.

644
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:24,520
His wickedness.

645
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:25,640
I just

646
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:27,840
love him so much.

647
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:29,600
Stop acting like an idiot.

648
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:30,800
Sister,

649
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:31,280
let's go.

650
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:32,080
We need to hurry up.

651
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:32,800
Go.

652
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:33,600
I'm not going.

653
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:34,320
Suit yourself.

654
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:36,880
Just go with me.

655
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:38,960
Don't you miss your Liu Liangzhou?

656
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:40,960
My Liu Liangzhou?

657
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:42,280
Don't be ridiculous.

658
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:44,120
What about the other day?

659
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:46,320
That was not nice of you to drag him into that.

660
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:48,120
You should apologize to him in person.

661
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:48,800
Right?

662
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:51,400
I already apologized to him.

663
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:53,840
I don't want to disturb him when he's working.

664
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:57,560
Sister, please.

665
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:58,760
Just be my company,

666
00:29:58,760 --> 00:29:59,480
alright?

667
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:00,800
I don't want to go alone.

668
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,400
I'll feel sad and lonely.

669
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:03,240
Come with me.

670
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:03,920
Let's go.

671
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:16,600
Yishan,

672
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:18,280
follow my lead.

673
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:21,760
Just look in her direction.

674
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:31,080
So I'll just look at you.

675
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:33,000
But you don't need to be like you're taking an oath.

676
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:37,360
She just can't help herself
 when she sees someone she admires.

677
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:38,240
I hope you don't mind.

678
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:39,600
Not at all.

679
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:41,360
I'm confident in myself.

680
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:43,840
I have confidence in you, too.

681
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:46,440
I don't think Zhang Yishan
will see her as a potential girlfriend.

682
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:49,400
Then he doesn't have good taste.

683
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:51,000
Yishan,

684
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,320
loosen up a bit.

685
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:53,200
Give me a smile.

686
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:54,600
I don't hate to smile.

687
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:55,760
But I hate it when I have to fake it.

688
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:57,320
I just can't fake a smile.

689
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:01,520
Did you capture that?

690
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:02,840
That is my true emotion.

691
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:04,160
Yes, I did. It's great.

692
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:10,880
Now I know

693
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:11,680
why

694
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:14,280
male stars contribute more to the box office
 than female stars.

695
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:15,240
Why?

696
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:16,280
Imagine.

697
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:17,800
If a girl likes some good-looking actor,

698
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:19,560
she'll ask her boyfriend to go to the cinema with her.

699
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:21,520
So they'll buy two tickets.

700
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:24,240
But if a boy likes some pretty actress, he won't dare

701
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:26,000
to ask his girlfriend to watch that movie together.

702
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,560
Because it only leads to a fight.

703
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:29,040
You have a point.

704
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:30,360
Yishan, that's all for today.

705
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:31,000
Great.

706
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:33,320
Don't take that off yet.

707
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:35,200
Mr. Zhang,

708
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,760
do you mind taking a picture with me?

709
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:39,080
Look, we wear the same color today.

710
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:40,040
Such a coincidence!

711
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:40,800
OK. No problem.

712
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:41,720
Thank you so much.

713
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:43,840
I'm just speechless.

714
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:44,800
Good for her.

715
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,280
Sorry, lady.

716
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:47,280
We have to go.

717
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:47,920
Please hurry.

718
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:48,400
Of course.

719
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:49,440
Allow me to take another one.

720
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:53,200
What do you think?

721
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:53,680
Do you like it?

722
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:54,240
Hello.

723
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:55,280
Excuse me.

724
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:56,480
I just want to remind you that...

725
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:57,080
I know.

726
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:58,480
I won't post on Weibo or WeChat Moments.

727
00:31:58,480 --> 00:31:59,480
I'll keep them to myself.

728
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:00,560
Thanks for your understanding.

729
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:01,440
No problem.

730
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:02,120
Bye, everyone.

731
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:04,240
Actually, I'm an actress.

732
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:05,160
I ran into you

733
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:06,320
a few times in Hengdian.

734
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:07,600
But I never had a chance to say hi.

735
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:08,400
Next time.

736
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:10,040
We'll greet each other next time.

737
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:11,880
I really love your works.

738
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:13,560
Calm down.

739
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:15,680
I'm not finished.

740
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:17,040
He's busy.

741
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:18,360
Xiaoyu.

742
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:20,240
It's hot.

743
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:20,800
Thank you.

744
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:23,800
This is his signature wicked smile.

745
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:26,080
Can I get obsessed with some pretty actress

746
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:27,240
just like you do

747
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:27,760
with Zhang Yishan?

748
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:28,800
I'll kill you.

749
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:30,080
See?

750
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:31,160
I'm totally right.

751
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,560
Look. I have another one.

752
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:34,320
This is 30,000

753
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:35,680
after tax.

754
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:36,880
I'm off then.

755
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:38,120
Thanks. See you.

756
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:49,560
Tianyi.

757
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:50,680
This is 300,000 in total.

758
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:52,120
Why don't you just transfer it to me?

759
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:53,400
I withdrew these notes on purpose.

760
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:54,520
It's just a ritual.

761
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:00,000
What is this?

762
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:02,000
My baby.

763
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:20,680
That is some cool stuff.

764
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:22,280
Is this for film-shooting?

765
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:23,320
In the past,

766
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:25,120
in the age of film photography,

767
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:27,520
this was the Rolls-Royce of cameras.

768
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:29,080
The body alone

769
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:31,160
was worth an apartment in Beijing back then.

770
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:32,680
The matte box alone

771
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:34,000
is worth tens of thousands of dollars.

772
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:37,440
Do they still work?

773
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:39,160
It works just fine as soon as you install the film.

774
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:41,160
But unfortunately, it's the digital age now.

775
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:42,680
I can't buy the film anywhere.

776
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,360
So you bought it just to enjoy the sight of it.

777
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:45,080
It's an antique.

778
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:46,600
It's worth collecting.

779
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:48,240
Songyang knows me.

780
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,960
You spent 300,000 on this piece of iron?

781
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:52,160
Do you think 300,000 is too expensive?

782
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:55,560
But in fact, I was so lucky to get this for 300,000.

783
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:57,800
I still need a lens.

784
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:58,920
I've already asked about the price.

785
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,160
I can get one for 150,000.

786
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:02,560
It'll be perfect when I get it.

787
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:03,640
Liangzhou, you have my support.

788
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:04,640
I just don't have the money.

789
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:05,400
If I was rich,

790
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:06,200
I would just buy one for you

791
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:08,040
to complete your set.

792
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:09,960
I'll start another project soon.

793
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:11,199
I'll buy it as soon as I get the remuneration.

794
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:13,840
What do you think?

795
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:14,840
It's amazing.

796
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,600
Everyone has something he or she likes.

797
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:19,280
You spend your money on these.

798
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:21,199
I spend my money on adventures.

799
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:22,000
Right.

800
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,480
You do extreme sports.

801
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:24,800
Extreme sports?

802
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:26,000
It's just him digging his own grave.

803
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:28,040
You won't die as long as you don't seek death.

804
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:28,960
Now I know.

805
00:34:29,239 --> 00:34:32,040
Neither of you is built for an ordinary life.

806
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:33,199
Liu Liangzhou,

807
00:34:33,719 --> 00:34:35,320
look at my sister's face.

808
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:38,679
Xiaoyu,

809
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:39,840
smile.

810
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:43,480
You can just give up.

811
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:46,560
Listen, my sister will never understand.

812
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:47,600
If she has money,

813
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:49,040
she'll spend it on handbags.

814
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:50,880
That is a real investment.

815
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:52,199
See?

816
00:34:52,199 --> 00:34:53,000
So corny.

817
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:56,320
The bags are always there. You can buy them anytime.

818
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:57,920
But you can't necessarily buy this

819
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,240
even if you have the money.

820
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:00,880
Then I'm happy for you.

821
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:02,440
Hello? Who ordered takeaway?

822
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:04,360
Me.

823
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:06,040
So everybody is here and dinner is ready.

824
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:07,440
I'll make the first toast.

825
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:10,760
On behalf of our firm,

826
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,720
I'd like to thank Mr. Chen

827
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:15,240
for entrusting us with such important work.

828
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:17,080
Overall, we did a good job.

829
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:19,640
Through our close cooperation,

830
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:21,200
Mr. Chen's company

831
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:23,160
successfully went public.

832
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:25,760
Let's raise our glasses.

833
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:27,160
Congratulations, Mr. Chen.

834
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:28,240
Cheers.

835
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:28,840
What a good day!

836
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:29,640
Congratulations.

837
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:31,200
Cheers.

838
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:34,960
Great.

839
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,840
I'll make the second toast.

840
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:38,640
Of course.

841
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:40,680
I am grateful

842
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:44,720
to your firm for all the support you provided.

843
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:47,320
I look forward to our long-term partnership.

844
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:47,960
All right?

845
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:48,800
To our future cooperation!

846
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:51,200
Come on. Cheers.

847
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:52,520
Thank you, Mr. Chen.

848
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:53,880
Thanks, Mr. Chen.

849
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:57,040
Mr. Du.

850
00:35:58,680 --> 00:35:59,640
Wei Lan?

851
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:01,240
What are you doing here?

852
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:02,760
It's such a coincidence.

853
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:04,720
The furnishing style of this restaurant
 is quite unique.

854
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:05,520
So I came to check it out.

855
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:07,440
I didn't know you are here, too.

856
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:08,400
Mr. Du,

857
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,040
who is this?

858
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:13,440
She's an intern at our firm.

859
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:14,800
Her name's Wei Lan.

860
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:16,880
So it's one of our own.

861
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:18,600
Have you eaten?

862
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:19,480
It's alright.

863
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:21,440
I'll just eat by myself.

864
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:22,520
Wait.

865
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:24,400
Mr. Du,

866
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:25,880
she can join us.

867
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:27,920
It might be inconvenient.

868
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:29,240
There's nothing inconvenient.

869
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:30,880
Come in.

870
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:32,160
Add a chair.

871
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:34,920
Sit.

872
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:35,800
Just take a seat.

873
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:36,920
Come on.

874
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:37,840
Sit down.

875
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:38,840
Thanks.

876
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:41,480
Thank you.

877
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,360
May I borrow your wine?

878
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:51,600
Mr. Chen.

879
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:52,400
Mr. Du.

880
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:54,240
I'm sorry to interrupt.

881
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:55,280
I'll apologize with this wine.

882
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:04,080
May I borrow more?

883
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:11,680
Mr. Du,

884
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:13,160
this one is to you.

885
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:14,680
I won't forget

886
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:15,960
what you told me in the afternoon.

887
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:17,400
Thanks for your advice.

888
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:20,320
Don't mention it.

889
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:23,120
Sometimes I have to be cruel to be kind.

890
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:25,320
Please don't take it personally.

891
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:28,680
It seems that

892
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,400
the partners in your firm

893
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:32,760
really care about the employees.

894
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:35,160
This is so precious.

895
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:37,440
Thanks. I feel embarrassed.

896
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:42,600
Mr. Chen, this one is to you.

897
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:43,800
To me?

898
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,120
For what?

899
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:50,720
To the fact

900
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:52,800
that you're brilliant at making your choice.

901
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:53,800
Am I?

902
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:56,120
Of course you are.

903
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:57,880
Thanks for choosing us.

904
00:37:58,600 --> 00:37:59,680
Mr. Du,

905
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:01,880
you made a good choice, too.

906
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,560
You have such a good employee.

907
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:05,400
You must drink this one, too.

908
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:08,440
Alright. I'll take this one.

909
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:11,120
Thanks.

910
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:12,120
Cheers.

911
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:19,880
Cheers.

912
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:20,800
Have some tea.

913
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:21,880
It'll help you sober up.

914
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:26,320
Mr. Du.

915
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:34,400
Mr. Du.

916
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:36,960
As you saw this evening,

917
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:38,320
Mr. Chen

918
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:39,880
was definitely impressed by me.

919
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:42,240
It shows that I'm competent for this job.

920
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:46,080
Can you just transfer me to Asset Valuation?

921
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:48,240
I won't let you down.

922
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:53,880
You followed me here, didn't you?

923
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:57,000
Of course not. It was a coincidence.

924
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:59,520
You really think I'm a fool, don't you?

925
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:03,960
As I said, you are smart.

926
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:07,240
But can you please apply your talent

927
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:09,840
to the right things?

928
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:13,920
I don't know what you're talking about.

929
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:17,040
You listened outside for a while
 before you came in, right?

930
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:20,760
Why did you say that?

931
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:22,600
Stop it.

932
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:26,960
If you didn't,

933
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:29,240
how come that you called him Mr. Chen directly?

934
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:31,240
Have I introduced you two?

935
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:32,560
Or do you know him?

936
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:38,400
Listen to me.

937
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:40,760
I won't

938
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:42,840
feel sorry for you

939
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:45,000
after what you did.

940
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:48,400
You only made me hate you more.

941
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:52,880
Mr. Du, I think there's some misunderstanding
 between us.

942
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:55,160
What about we go somewhere else?

943
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:56,840
I'm going home.

944
00:39:58,120 --> 00:40:00,080
My wife is waiting for me.

945
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:11,680
Be careful.

946
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:16,640
Don't touch me.

947
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:18,520
Let me help you.

948
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:24,280
I'll call a designated driver for you.
