00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:23,640
Well.

181
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,160
I don't know.

182
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,360
What Han?

183
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:28,600
If you don't know him,

184
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,800
why did you say his name?

185
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,200
I did?

186
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,200
No way.

187
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,640
I don't know Han.

188
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,120
What are you talking about?

189
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,120
Wait. Wait.

190
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:41,600
Let's make it clear.

191
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:43,280
Who is Han?

192
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,840
I don't know him.

193
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,280
I don't know him well.

194
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:49,440
What?

195
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,080
You just said you didn't know him.

196
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,600
Now you don't know him well?

197
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,400
Who the hell is Han?

198
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,360
I just can't

199
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,760
keep secrets, can I?

200
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:02,680
OK, I'll tell you.

201
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:03,840
You can't get mad.

202
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,520
Han...

203
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,240
He is some guy I just met.

204
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,600
Single, cute,

205
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,800
and kind of rich.

206
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:15,840
What?

207
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,200
Let me finish.

208
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:21,240
When I first met him,

209
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,560
I felt that

210
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,000
the smell of him

211
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,600
really appealed to me.

212
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,440
So I asked him.

213
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,280
I said,

214
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:29,960
Han, what do you do for a living?

215
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,520
Guess what he said.

216
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:33,080
How should I know?

217
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:35,240
He said he's from Shanxi Province.

218
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,240
His family owns a big factory,

219
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,840
producing vinegar only.

220
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:40,440
So I said,

221
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:43,000
what a coincidence!

222
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,600
My boyfriend loves vinegar.

223
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:45,800
Then he said,

224
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:46,880
Miss,

225
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,120
now you are Han's friend.

226
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,280
No matter when,

227
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,640
say my name, and you'll get vinegar.

228
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:52,760
That's it.

229
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,960
Are you kidding me?

230
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,200
Are you playing with me?

231
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:58,840
Huh?

232
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:00,480
You asked for it.

233
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,640
I said I don't know him.

234
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:02,920
You had to ask.

235
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:04,080
You are bad.

236
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:05,720
Tell me.

237
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:06,880
Did you get jealous?

238
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:08,960
I smelt something sour.

239
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,560
So strong.

240
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,240
Eat my fart.

241
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:12,920
That's not funny.

242
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:13,880
Eat fart?

243
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,400
You'd better eat it yourself.

244
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,560
I'll pass.

245
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:17,920
You are so bad.

246
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:18,360
I was busy.

247
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,680
You had to make me stop.

248
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,880
You are bad.

249
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:25,280
You could have spent the whole time

250
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:27,840
chatting with me rather than being jealous.

251
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:29,400
OK. OK.

252
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,440
I'll play with you.

253
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,000
That's more like it.

254
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,120
What do you want to play?

255
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,120
I'm thirsty.

256
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:36,440
Pour me a glass of water, please.

257
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:37,560
OK. OK.

258
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:38,520
It's my sister.

259
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,160
Hello?

260
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:46,760
I'm at Yu Songyang's house now.

261
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:47,640
What happened?

262
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:53,840
Where are you right now?

263
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:55,720
OK.

264
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:56,680
I got it.

265
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:57,240
Wait for me.

266
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,200
I'll be right back.

267
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:58,840
OK. Bye.

268
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:01,040
My sister had a huge fight with Peng Pai.

269
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:02,480
I have to go home now.

270
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,560
Is she okay?

271
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:04,640
Not so good.

272
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,040
Crying so hard.

273
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:06,780
Do you want me to go with you?

274
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:07,440
It's okay.

275
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,920
You still have work to do.

276
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,640
Sweetheart.

277
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,960
I will go to Huairou tomorrow.

278
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,440
Be good.

279
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:18,600
Huairou is not far.

280
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:19,960
I'll visit you when I'm done.

281
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:20,680
Hmm.

282
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:23,760
OK, I should go.

283
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:25,600
Call me if you need anything.

284
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,240
OK.

285
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,440
Be careful.

286
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,600
OK. Bye.

287
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:38,760
Sorry, the number you have dialed is busy.

288
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:40,520
Please try again later.

289
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:55,000
Sorry, the subscriber you have dialed is power off.

290
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:03,280
Sorry,

291
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:05,520
the subscriber you have dialed is power off.

292
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:34,360
Hello.

293
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:35,200
Hello.

294
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,480
Excuse me.

295
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:37,360
Is Dai Xiaoyu here?

296
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:38,760
No.

297
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:39,480
OK.

298
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:43,420
What about Bao Xue?

299
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:44,040
Is she here?

300
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:45,600
No, she's not here, either.

301
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,160
Is there anything you need?

302
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:49,160
No.

303
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:50,680
Thank you.

304
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:03,600
Well,

305
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:05,960
Henan's father

306
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:08,080
has been in the kitchen for his whole life.

307
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,000
But when he watches TV,

308
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,440
still, food shows.

309
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:13,440
He loves what he does.

310
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:14,640
Mrs. Zhao.

311
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:16,560
Where do you want to go tomorrow?

312
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,240
I heard from our old classmates

313
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,680
that there is a temple

314
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,280
called Hongluo Temple in Beijing, right?

315
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:21,800
Yeah.

316
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:23,560
Do you want to go?

317
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:24,280
Sure.

318
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:25,440
Then let's go there.

319
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,640
I heard that it's a great place 
to pray for a good marriage.

320
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,200
I'll burn some incense and pray for you.

321
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:31,800
Sure.

322
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:34,200
Wherever you want to go.

323
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:34,720
Great.

324
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:35,920
Hmm.

325
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:36,640
Enough of TV.

326
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:37,840
Let's go back to the hotel.

327
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:39,480
It'll be over in a few minutes.

328
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:40,960
Turn it off now.

329
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,960
They need to go to bed.

330
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:45,160
I'll go get Henan.

331
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:46,360
No need.

332
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:47,480
We can go by ourselves.

333
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:48,440
Don't bother.

334
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:49,320
Let him sleep.

335
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,200
OK.

336
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,480
I'll get you a cab.

337
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:55,160
See you tomorrow.

338
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:55,720
See you.

339
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:56,480
Goodbye.

340
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:57,920
Go home and rest.

341
00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:58,800
Go.

342
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,040
Bye-bye.

343
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:47,680
You're awake.

344
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,160
How did I fall asleep?

345
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,200
I found that

346
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:12,000
showing them around 
is more tiring than cooking in the kitchen.

347
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,680
Your parents went back to the hotel.

348
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,720
Thank you for these days.

349
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:20,880
You are a good actress.

350
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,240
My dad and my mom

351
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,880
really believe you are my girlfriend.

352
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:27,840
Your parents

353
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:29,440
and you are all very kind.

354
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:32,360
When I was with them these days,

355
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,920
sometimes I forgot

356
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:36,560
that I am just pretending.

357
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:42,280
OK.

358
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:44,040
Good night.

359
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:45,040
I should go.

360
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:46,440
Hmm.

361
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:07,800
Bye.

362
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:09,360
Bye.

363
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,640
Can you see the lights here from outside?

364
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,160
Of course, yes.

365
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,040
Then turn off the light.

366
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,040
He will definitely come here to find me.

367
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,200
I don't want to see him.

368
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:58,000
Sis.

369
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,400
I don't think this is a long-term solution.

370
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,520
If he comes over today and sees a dark room,

371
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:04,200
he'll probably come here again tomorrow.

372
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,319
If you are really

373
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:08,319
determined this time,

374
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:10,240
you should talk to him face to face.

375
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,000
When I heard

376
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:19,160
what he said to me today,

377
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:22,760
I felt like another word with him

378
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:25,680
would be a total insult to me.

379
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:27,119
How could I talk to him?

380
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:30,480
I can't.

381
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,280
I want to stay here for tonight.

382
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:38,880
I left home in a hurry,

383
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:39,840
so I didn't bring anything.

384
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:42,160
I will find a hotel tomorrow.

385
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:44,560
Why hotel?

386
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:45,920
What's wrong with my place?

387
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:46,600
No.

388
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,160
He will definitely come here to find me.

389
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:53,320
But you didn't bring anything with you.

390
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:54,840
Not even clothes to change.

391
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:55,840
What should you do?

392
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,760
I can wear yours.

393
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,880
When you finish shooting,

394
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:02,680
you can go to his place

395
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:04,200
and get all my stuff for me.

396
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:06,400
OK.

397
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:13,000
You have cried your eyes out.

398
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:13,520
Now,

399
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:14,480
you should take some rest.

400
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:19,120
Bao Xue.

401
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:26,680
Bao Xue?

402
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:36,040
Xiaoyu?

403
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:55,600
Xiaoyu.

404
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:11,480
He's gone.

405
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:22,760
Why am I so unlucky?

406
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:27,000
There, there.

407
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,520
Stop overthinking.

408
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:31,760
I think you are right.

409
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:33,960
Your child. Your decision.

410
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:36,400
If you really want to have it,

411
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,240
I will raise the baby with you.

412
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,000
Yuanyuan fell asleep.

413
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:51,160
She just finished the course on Banma AI KE.

414
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:52,040
You know what?

415
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:53,640
Our girl likes it.

416
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:54,960
Look at this study report.

417
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,240
All three stars.

418
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:58,920
Our daughter used to

419
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:00,320
study only under watch.

420
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,480
Now she learns on her own initiative.

421
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:04,240
How nice!

422
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,600
If a kid can study

423
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,440
without parents' supervision,

424
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:11,000
that'll be the best.

425
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,840
I want to tell you something.

426
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:15,960
Sure.

427
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:19,080
Starting tomorrow, I want to go to Crossroad Bistro

428
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:21,120
and help You Shanshan for a few days.

429
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:24,200
Is her restaurant

430
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,120
understaffed?

431
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,520
Feng Xi has to take days off.

432
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:29,600
You Shanshan needs to 
watch the store herself for a few days.

433
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:30,800
I'm thinking that

434
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:32,320
I'm kind of free.

435
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,040
Go ahead.

436
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:39,280
Will you pick up the children?

437
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,360
Sure.

438
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:41,160
Who else?

439
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:43,280
Du Shijun.

440
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:46,920
I think something is wrong with you.

441
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:48,560
What's wrong with me?

442
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:49,400
Usually,

443
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,880
you must have tones of questions.

444
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:53,480
Why did you agree so fast today?

445
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:54,800
You...

446
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:58,800
In the past, I didn't support your work.

447
00:20:58,800 --> 00:20:59,480
So you were unhappy.

448
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:01,080
Now I support you, but you think I'm weird.

449
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:03,000
Who is weird, really?

450
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,120
It's unnatural.

451
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,600
Your reaction is strange.

452
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:12,400
Recently,

453
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,400
you come home early,

454
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:15,280
you cook,

455
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:17,560
and you even put Yuanyuan to bed just now.

456
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:18,800
Be honest with me,

457
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:19,800
did you do something bad

458
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:21,120
behind my back again?

459
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,760
You are quite observant.

460
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,680
I did do one thing.

461
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:29,560
What thing?

462
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,120
Through my hard work,

463
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:35,600
the department I am in charge of

464
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:36,360
shifted.

465
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:40,840
It used to be the evaluation department,

466
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:42,040
and now it is the audit.

467
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:43,800
Why?

468
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:46,360
Since that incident happened,

469
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,480
I have been thinking for a long time.

470
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:51,400
I think I should

471
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:53,760
respect your ideas and choices.

472
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:55,880
I shouldn't always say

473
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:57,080
that I'm the breadwinner

474
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,320
and keep you in the house.

475
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:00,160
When we had that trip,

476
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:00,960
you said that

477
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,520
we need to change.

478
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:05,520
Can't agree more.

479
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:06,920
We must change.

480
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,400
And I think, not just us.

481
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,720
Everyone needs to change as well.

482
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:11,400
And it should start with me.

483
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,960
You should have your time,

484
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,000
your space,

485
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,440
and your own circle of friends.

486
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:21,040
Now that I'm in the audit department.

487
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:23,040
There will be less entertainment than before.

488
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:24,880
Things that can be discussed in the office

489
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,800
don't have to be taken to the dinner table.

490
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:28,600
In this way,

491
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:30,160
I can take care of my family more.

492
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:32,040
If you get busy someday,

493
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:33,720
this house won't be messed up.

494
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:34,400
Right?

495
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,760
Did I hear you right?

496
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,200
I was just kidding.

497
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:46,200
Well,

498
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:48,560
I mean it.

499
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:49,440
In the future,

500
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:50,920
I will pick up the kids most of the time.

501
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:52,720
You can do your own thing.

502
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,120
If you have nothing to do, you can just

503
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:55,840
stay at home and write

504
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:56,680
or cook.

505
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,600
If sometimes I have entertainment,

506
00:22:58,600 --> 00:22:59,720
I will tell you in advance.

507
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:00,840
OK?

508
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:03,240
Is it perfect?

509
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:03,880
Hmm.

510
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:07,720
After hearing what you said,

511
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:11,000
I almost want to thank Wei Lan for this.

512
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:13,000
What?

513
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,040
You thank her?

514
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:15,720
This is what I realized by myself

515
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:17,400
after I was vindicated, OK?

516
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,480
Don't thank her!

517
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:21,280
Do the policemen have to thank the criminals

518
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:22,960
for catching them?

519
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:24,960
Your analogy

520
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,800
is quite accurate.

521
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:27,440
Of course.

522
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,680
I'm in the audit department now.

523
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:29,960
I have to be accurate.

524
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:31,360
Now,

525
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:32,760
can we not talk about her?

526
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:33,720
OK.

527
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:34,760
Never.

528
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:38,320
I'll be mad if I hear her name again.

529
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:41,160
If I weren't your husband,

530
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:42,280
I would be mad at you.

531
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:44,840
I'll go brush my teeth.

532
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:53,120
OK.

533
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:56,440
Today is my first morning meeting with everyone.

534
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,120
Well...

535
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:01,640
Uh...

536
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:04,760
What do you guys usually talk about 
in the morning meetings?

537
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:10,520
All right. All right.

538
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:12,240
Let me introduce someone to you.

539
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,480
This is my friend Si Meng.

540
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:14,160
For the next few days,

541
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:15,800
she will help us in the restaurant.

542
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:16,640
Good morning.

543
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,600
Thank you for your hard work.

544
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:20,840
Without further ado,

545
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:21,760
what you did

546
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:22,440
when Feng Xi was here,

547
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:23,760
now keep doing it.

548
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:47,160
Hello.

549
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:47,960
Sis.

550
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:48,840
What are you doing?

551
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:50,960
I'm having breakfast.

552
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,320
Did you sleep well last night?

553
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:53,880
No.

554
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:57,040
I'll go back to sleep later.

555
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:58,040
Are you there yet?

556
00:24:58,040 --> 00:24:59,320
About that,

557
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:00,480
I found out that the crew arranged

558
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,520
a double room for me this time.

559
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:04,720
Come after you finish your breakfast.

560
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,600
Is it okay for me to go?

561
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:08,320
I can say you are my assistant.

562
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:09,840
Is that appropriate?

563
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,720
Sure.

564
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:12,640
If you're here,

565
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:13,840
I can take care of you.

566
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:14,800
I'll worry

567
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:15,920
if you stay alone.

568
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:16,800
Be a good girl.

569
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,960
Come right after breakfast.

570
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:19,640
OK.

571
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:21,240
Send me your location. Is it far?

572
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:22,720
No.

573
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:24,720
It's only one and a half hours by taxi.

574
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,160
Okay, I'll leave in a while.

575
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:27,160
Great.

576
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:27,640
OK.

577
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:28,680
See you later.

578
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:29,880
Bye.

579
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:48,480
Excuse me?

580
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:49,920
Yeah?

581
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:51,200
Are you sleepy?

582
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:53,840
I'm okay.

583
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:54,800
Not sleepy.

584
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,360
If you are sleepy,

585
00:25:58,360 --> 00:25:59,440
I can take another cab.

586
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:00,960
I'm fine.

587
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:33,000
Copy that.

588
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:33,720
Thanks.

589
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:40,640
I've got good news.

590
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,640
I don't have to shoot today!

591
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:56,080
Sis, where are you?

592
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:58,280
Hello?

593
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:00,120
Are you a friend of the phone's owner?

594
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:03,200
You are?

595
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:21,640
Excuse me! Sorry!

596
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:24,000
Excuse me!

597
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:24,920
My sister had a car accident.

598
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:25,560
Can I take this cab?

599
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:26,480
Thank you.

600
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:27,960
Chaoyang Hospital, please.

601
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:31,160
Uncle.

602
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:33,640
I am Xue.

603
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:44,880
Hello?

604
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:48,760
Shut up and listen to me.

605
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:51,800
My sister had a car accident just now.

606
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:53,600
She's in the ER.

607
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:56,760
I'm telling you, Peng.

608
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:59,440
If anything happens to my sister,

609
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:01,680
I'll kill you!

610
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:06,560
Please,

611
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:11,000
can you drive faster?

612
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:17,160
Hello.

613
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:18,200
I'm done...

614
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:21,520
What happened?

615
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:24,080
My sister had a car accident.

616
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,920
Bao Xue!

617
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:42,960
How is she?

618
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,520
Still in the operating room.

619
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,120
She'll be fine.

620
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:47,320
Doctor.

621
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:48,520
Doctor, how is she?

622
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:49,960
Are you Dai Xiaoyu's kin?

623
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:50,840
I am.

624
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:51,800
I am her cousin.

625
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:53,160
Her parents are on the way here.

626
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:55,160
You can tell me everything.

627
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:58,320
The patient's wound is not very large.

628
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,360
But the glass cuts are too deep.

629
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:02,120
Plus, she is two months pregnant.

630
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:02,920
The external squeeze

631
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:04,480
caused her inner wall to rupture.

632
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:06,280
There is also trauma on the outer wall,

633
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:07,880
which is causing extensive bleeding.

634
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:10,360
The uterus must be removed now.

635
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:11,360
We need your signature.

636
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:12,200
OK?

637
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,840
Doctor, please.

638
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:18,560
Is there any other way?

639
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,480
I can understand your feelings.

640
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:21,000
But now,

641
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,640
there is really no other way.

642
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:25,280
The patient's bleeding hasn't stopped yet.

643
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:27,360
Can you make a decision?

644
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:29,200
The patient really can't wait.

645
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,480
Please decide quickly.

646
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:31,040
OK?

647
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:34,680
I'll sign.

648
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:37,160
Also, I need to tell you that

649
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:39,480
now the blood bank in our hospital is running short.

650
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:41,640
It'll be best if her immediate family members 
can make blood transfusion.

651
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:43,680
When will her immediate family members arrive?

652
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:46,160
Her parents are coming from Hangzhou.

653
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:47,840
They will arrive in the evening.

654
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:48,600
What should I do?

655
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:50,520
If we transfer blood from other hospitals,

656
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:51,600
I'm afraid the time...

657
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:52,520
Doctor,

658
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:53,920
My blood type is the same as hers.

659
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:54,440
Take mine.

660
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:56,200
What is your relationship with the patient?

661
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:56,760
Friends.

662
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:58,080
Take a blood compatibility test.

663
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:59,320
If your blood groups are compatible,

664
00:29:59,320 --> 00:29:59,880
we can do it, OK?

665
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:00,240
Yes.

666
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:01,800
Prepare him chocolate or something.

667
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:02,640
OK.

668
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:03,200
Thanks.

669
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:08,560
Don't worry.

670
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:09,800
Thank you, Liu.

671
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:10,760
She will be fine.

672
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:18,720
Please,

673
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:21,400
I'm begging you.

674
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:25,280
Please ask the doctor to come up with another way.

675
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,120
Aunt.

676
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:28,480
She keeps bleeding now.

677
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:31,480
If I don't sign, it will be too late for her.

678
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:32,920
Don't blame me.

679
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:35,440
Xue.

680
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:37,160
Sign the form now.

681
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:38,720
Her life matters the most.

682
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:40,360
Xue.

683
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:41,520
We'll be there in a while.

684
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:44,160
OK.

685
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:51,040
She is only 30 years old.

686
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:55,760
How can she face the fact?

687
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:04,640
Liu Liangzhou.

688
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:06,160
Who is Liu Liangzhou?

689
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:06,680
I am.

690
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:07,680
Come. Please check this.

691
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:09,080
Is your name Liu Liangzhou?

692
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:09,320
Yes.

693
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:11,000
Can you confirm that you have type O blood?

694
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:11,320
Yes.

695
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:13,480
You want to make 
a voluntary blood donation to Dai Xiaoyu, right?

696
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:13,960
Yes.

697
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:15,160
OK, come with me.

698
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:15,920
OK.

699
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:18,200
[Operation]

700
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:21,400
The baby is gone.

701
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:25,560
Not just the baby,

702
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:26,880
so is her uterus.

703
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:29,840
Now your daughter can have a dad of her own.

704
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:30,920
Can you stop talking?

705
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:34,360
Please?

706
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:37,520
I didn't want this to happen.

707
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,360
Shut up!

708
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:48,280
How is she, doctor?

709
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,080
The patient is out of danger.

710
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:51,920
Now she is transferred to ICU.

711
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:54,840
Can we see her now?

712
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:56,080
Not yet.

713
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,440
She's bled so much

714
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:59,360
that she has to be observed in the ICU for a few hours.

715
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:00,740
If there is no more problem,

716
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:02,200
she can be transferred to the surgical ward.

717
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:03,320
You can see her then.

718
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:03,980
Thank you.

719
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:05,280
Also, she has to be admitted for a few days.

720
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:06,520
You should prepare some things

721
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:07,520
for her hospitalization.

722
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:08,320
Of course.

723
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:09,040
No problem.

724
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:10,680
I'll buy the stuff.

725
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:12,480
I'll go.

726
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:13,480
Let him do it.

727
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:16,240
And,

728
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:17,400
thank you.

729
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:26,200
Liu.

730
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:30,560
Thank you.

731
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:33,720
Don't say that.

732
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:35,520
You don't need to say that to me.

733
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:37,680
You saved my sister's life.

734
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:40,280
She is also my friend.

735
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,360
Don't cry.

736
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:47,960
Sit down.

737
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:54,120
Excuse me, nurse.

738
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:55,000
Where is Dai Xiaoyu?

739
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:55,920
C15.

740
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:56,720
Okay, thank you.

741
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:57,840
Thanks.

742
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:01,720
Uncle, aunt.

743
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:02,440
Xue.

744
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:03,760
Hello.

745
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:06,000
I'm Peng Pai.

746
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:09,000
How is she now?

747
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,360
She just fell asleep.

748
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:11,400
You can go in.

749
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:12,480
OK.

750
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:17,080
You. Go away.

751
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:41,680
Xue.

752
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:44,320
How did that happen?

753
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:45,440
Xue.

754
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:47,840
Aunt.

755
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:49,080
Aunt.

756
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:50,600
I can't explain to you

757
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:52,200
the whole thing clearly right now.

758
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:53,280
When she wakes up,

759
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:55,200
I'll tell you everything then, okay?

760
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:57,080
What did the doctor say?

761
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:58,520
How is Xiaoyu?

762
00:33:58,520 --> 00:33:59,720
The doctor said

763
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:01,840
she is out of danger now.

764
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:03,200
She just woke up for a while,

765
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:04,680
and now she is asleep again.

766
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:11,320
Sit here.

767
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:16,520
There was a young man out there.

768
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:17,440
Who is he?

769
00:34:17,719 --> 00:34:19,760
He is a friend of ours.

770
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:21,120
Before you came,

771
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:23,440
he donated blood to her.

772
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:29,320
Xiaoyu.

773
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:40,840
Mr. Dai.

774
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:46,199
What's your name?

775
00:34:46,679 --> 00:34:48,080
My name is Liu Liangzhou.

776
00:34:58,880 --> 00:34:59,960
Thank you.

777
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:02,200
My pleasure.

778
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:04,960
Xiaoyu.

779
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:06,480
You're awake.

780
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:07,960
Xiaoyu?

781
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:14,840
Sis.

782
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:16,720
Don't move now.

783
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:17,920
You can't move now.

784
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:20,920
Mom.

785
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:24,680
Dad.

786
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:26,920
Xiaoyu, don't get too excited.

787
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:28,320
Dad is here.

788
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:33,400
When you were in the OR,

789
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:35,840
it was Liu who gave you his blood.

790
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:38,600
Dai.

791
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:39,720
Get out.

792
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,040
I'll be near the door.

793
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:47,480
Call me if you need anything.

794
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:52,840
Get out.

795
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:10,320
Thank you.

796
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:13,440
I will go home now

797
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,520
and come again tomorrow.

798
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:16,480
Don't show up in front of us anymore.

799
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,120
I know you hate me.

800
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:24,360
But it has happened.

801
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:26,280
You hating me can't solve any problem.

802
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:27,120
What I can do now

803
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:28,880
is to try my best to make it up to her.

804
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:29,400
I will

805
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:32,080
book a hotel room for her parents to stay.

806
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:33,880
I have booked one.

807
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:34,600
And,

808
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:36,000
You don't have to

809
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:38,240
feel stressed about this.

810
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:40,160
We don't need you to make it up to us.

811
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:40,800
You

812
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,960
just go back and live your life.

813
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:44,600
I can tell you this explicitly.

814
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:45,480
Peng Pai.

815
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:49,080
Your relationship with my sister
 is absolutely over.

816
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:52,000
Everything she has been through today
 is caused by you.

817
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:52,960
You and she

818
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,640
are never, ever getting back together.

819
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:55,120
Xue.

820
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:57,120
I don't want to argue with you.

821
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:58,360
Can you calm down?

822
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,280
If Xiaoyu

823
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:01,640
could calm down today,

824
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:03,400
she wouldn't have had such a big accident.

825
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:07,480
I won't make excuses.

826
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:08,760
But I'm telling you

827
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:10,320
I care about Xiaoyu.

828
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:11,120
I love her very much.

829
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:11,920
I will take care of her

830
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:12,880
no matter what happens to her.

831
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:14,760
Cut it out!

832
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:15,280
Listen,

833
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:16,520
what you're saying now

834
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:18,200
sounds like farting to me.

835
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:18,920
OK?

836
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:22,200
I'm calm enough now.

837
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:24,200
If I calm down more, I'll freeze.

838
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:28,800
I suggest you leave now.

839
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:30,320
If my uncle finds out

840
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:32,160
why this happened,

841
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:33,920
he will definitely kill you.

842
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:35,600
Fuck off.

843
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:41,760
I'll come tomorrow.

844
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:42,640
Fuck off!

845
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:43,760
I'll come tomorrow.

846
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:50,240
What?

847
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:54,340
You should go in there and stay with them.

848
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:55,680
I'll buy you something to eat.

849
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,760
Thanks, Liu.

850
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:00,680
Go in there.

851
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:12,320
Xiaoyu.

852
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:26,840
Mom.

853
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:31,280
I'm sorry.

854
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:34,680
Xiaoyu.

855
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:38,120
I don't blame you.

856
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:41,840
How can I blame you?

857
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:43,600
Don't say sorry.

858
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:52,440
Dad.

859
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:55,600
I'm sorry.

860
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:57,120
Xiaoyu.

861
00:38:58,400 --> 00:38:59,800
I'm the one who's sorry.
