4
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:11,520
Excuse me. Thanks.

5
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:25,440
Has the car arrived?

6
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,079
It's so far away.

7
00:02:28,079 --> 00:02:29,640
Will we come back after visiting?

8
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:30,520
Of course not.

9
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,040
Even if we do, they'd be off work.

10
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:32,680
After you.

11
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:33,280
OK.

12
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,480
What will you have for dinner?

13
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:47,760
Yuan eats some stuff at kindergarten.

14
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:48,960
When she comes back,

15
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,000
she just eats some snacks.

16
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,600
Over the past few days,

17
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,720
Zhuang had enough fast food for a year.

18
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,640
But his body is growing.

19
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,920
He can't just eat fast food every day, right?

20
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,320
I know that, too.

21
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,280
But these days,

22
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,520
I don't even have the mood to do the grocery and cook.

23
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,760
Argue as you wish,

24
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,240
just don't involve the kids, okay?

25
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,360
Here's the thing.

26
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,280
Listen to me.

27
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,680
Take your kids to my restaurant from now on.

28
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,120
My chefs don't put MSG in the food.

29
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,360
Order any dish that you like.

30
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,280
It'll be on me.

31
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,840
It's alright. There's no need.

32
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:23,240
I've been causing so much trouble to you 
 in the past few days.

33
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,280
Don't mention it.

34
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,600
It's not a problem for me at all.

35
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,770
Even if you take your kids to my place for dinner 
 every day,

36
00:03:27,770 --> 00:03:28,600
I can afford that.

37
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,240
Si Meng.

38
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,600
You really have to adjust yourself.

39

Whether you get a divorce or not,

40
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:41,200
you have to carry on with your life, right?

41
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,240
Indeed, I injured

42
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:46,560
1,000 enemy soldiers and lost 800 of mine.

43
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,079
800?

44
00:03:48,079 --> 00:03:49,440
It's like 3,000, alright?

45
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,600
Don't forget you have two kids.

46
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,520
Do you have something to do?

47
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,000
Attend to your business.

48
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,080
Don't worry about me.

49
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:05,800
I do have something to do.

50
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:09,240
Pick up the kids and go straight to my place for dinner.

51
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,000
Alright?

52
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:10,960
It's alright.

53
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,240
There's no need, really.

54
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,280
I'm not being ungrateful.

55
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:17,120
I'll do the grocery later on.

56
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:18,920
After I pick them up,

57
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:19,839
I'll cook dinner.

58
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,800
Alright, I'll go.

59
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:24,400
I'll walk you out.

60
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,960
You don't have to. Just sit there.

61
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:48,920
Du Shijun.

62
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:51,120
Send me Wei Lan's diagnosis from the hospital.

63
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,440
There's no need. Wait for my message.

64
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:30,840
Chai,

65
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:31,800
I remember

66
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,880
that you know someone from Beijing No.7 Hospital, right?

67
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:37,600
No one is sick.

68
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,080
I want to cooperate with them on one project.

69
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,000
Of course, I think about you when there's a profit.

70
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:48,080
Alright then, ask them for me.

71
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:50,840
I'll wait for your news.

72
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:51,920
OK.

73
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,000
I remember

74
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,040
we had dinner with someone from

75
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:00,160
Beijing No.7 Hospital, right?

76
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:03,160
Go through your contacts

77
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:05,300
and see if there's anyone from Beijing No.7 Hospital.

78
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,720
Beijing No.7 Hospital?

79
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,920
Hi, Granny. What are you doing?

80
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:27,760
I just lay down.

81
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:28,800
I want to sleep for a bit.

82
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,120
Granny,

83
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,680
did you mention

84
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,560
that Doctor Lv

85
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,120
worked in Beijing No.7 Hospital?

86
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,200
Yeah.

87
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,400
That's so great.

88
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:37,880
Granny,

89
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:40,159
I would like to ask Doctor Lv's for a favor.

90
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,920
But he's been retired for so many years.

91
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,680
What can he help you with?

92
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,720
It's okay that he is retired.

93
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,800
Some of his former colleagues must still be 
 in the hospital.

94
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:50,640
Right?

95
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:52,280
Granny, it's an urgent matter for real.

96
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:52,840
Can you just

97
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:53,520
help me

98
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:54,600
and ask him about it

99
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,040
for me, okay?

100
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:59,240
You're so troublesome.

101
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:00,720
Alright.

102
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,040
I'll call him.

103
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,320
Tell me

104
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,200
what's the matter.

105
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:06,440
I can't

106
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:08,040
explain it properly on the phone.

107
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:08,800
How about this, granny?

108
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,320
Tell him to go to your place right now.

109
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,360
I'll be back immediately.

110
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,960
Let's talk about this in person, okay?

111
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:14,600
OK.

112
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,240
Alright.

113
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:21,480
Comrades.

114
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,480
I have found him.

115
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,920
Later on, wait for my news.

116
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,800
What do you think?

117
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,159
Is it authentic?

118
00:07:34,159 --> 00:07:35,080
I can't tell.

119
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,200
I can't say it's fake

120
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,800
just by looking at the diagnosis.

121
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,360
After all,

122
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:42,040
I have been retired for so long.

123
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,520
Doctor Lv,

124
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:46,280
can I ask if you have any acquaintances

125
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:47,720
working in the hospital?

126
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,040
Well, yeah.

127
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,400
The current vice president

128
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,000
used to work in my department.

129
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,960
That's perfect.

130
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:57,320
Is it convenient for you to send the vice president

131
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58,880
messages on WeChat or call him

132
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:00,240
and ask him to check it?

133
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,080
Alright?

134
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,800
People of my age

135
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:03,960
are very conventional.

136
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:05,360
Sending messages on WeChat

137
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,800
feels very distant.

138
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:08,560
How about this?

139
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:10,280
I'll go to the hospital with her.

140
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,960
Just make a phone call.

141
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,400
You're not young anymore.

142
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,160
Don't let young people boss you around.

143
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:17,560
Granny,

144
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,720
you care about him a lot.

145
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,200
You're so bossy.

146
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,800
It's okay.

147
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:22,760
I'll think of this as a walk.

148
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:24,520
I can also visit my old colleague.

149
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,240
Come back soon, then.

150
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,280
I'll arrive at Beijing No.7 Hospital in half an hour.

151
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:31,640
OK.

152
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:32,559
Take care.

153
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:34,080
Alright.

154
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:38,360
Dong,

155
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,280
sorry to trouble you.

156
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:41,919
It's my pleasure.

157
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:43,120
Teacher,

158
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,800
you're still calling me Dong.

159
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,880
Everyone in the hospital addresses me as Senior Dong.

160
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,260
But when you address me like that,

161
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:49,080
I feel as if

162
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,000
I'm very young.

163
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,720
You will always

164
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:53,480
be Dong

165
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:54,280
to me.

166
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:55,200
Yes, of course.

167
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:56,440
Teacher,

168
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,840
how can I help you today?

169
00:08:58,520 --> 00:08:59,080
Xue,

170
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,400
can you show him?

171
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,400
OK. Just a minute.

172
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:05,600
They want to

173
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,640
ask for your help to check this diagnosis.

174
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,560
What would you like to know?

175
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:14,760
Here's the thing.

176
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:17,560
The patient to who this diagnosis belongs

177
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:19,020
is an employee in my company.

178
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:20,440
We require all employees to hand in

179
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:22,160
medical reports before they start working.

180
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,440
Her medical reports passed our check.

181
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,760
However, we

182
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:26,920
found out about this.

183
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:28,320
So, I think either this diagnosis

184
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,080
or the medical report

185
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,480
is fake.

186
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,520
Yeah.

187
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:32,680
First, let's not talk about

188
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:35,580
the fact that she needs maternity leave right after 
 getting on board.

189
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:36,480
Falsifying reflects

190
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,920
that she doesn't have good qualities.

191
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:38,440
Yeah.

192
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,040
Right?

193
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:39,760
Yeah.

194
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:40,760
You're right.

195
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:44,200
But just by looking at the picture,

196
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,120
I can't see a big problem.

197
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:51,400
Take a closer look at it.

198
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,160
Just a moment.

199
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:01,800
Hello.

200
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:02,960
Obstetrics and Gynecology.

201
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,200
Yes, Dong Peng speaking.

202
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,760
Check for me

203
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:08,240
on which day

204
00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:09,680
doctor Yang Xiaochen returned?

205
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:14,720
OK, I see.

206
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:17,400
So?

207
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:19,120
Any findings, president?

208
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:22,760
The doctor who signed

209
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:25,080
the diagnosis indeed works at this hospital.

210
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:27,320
However,

211
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:29,440
she wasn't in the office

212
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:30,880
on the day

213
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,480
of the signing and stamping.

214
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,480
She was on holiday.

215
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,880
She hasn't returned yet.

216
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,560
Therefore, the diagnosis...

217
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:37,840
It's fortified.

218
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,560
Nowadays,

219
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:40,920
they can fortify

220
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:41,680
really well.

221
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,080
That's a new experience.

222
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,640
They almost tricked me.

223
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,800
Thank you.

224
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:47,520
Dong.

225
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:48,480
Thank you a lot.

226
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:50,200
It's not a small thing.

227
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,480
You need to report it to the police.

228
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:53,000
Right?

229
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:53,680
Yeah.

230
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,560
Doctor Lv is completely right.

231
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:56,240
President Dong,

232
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,320
take this chance

233
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:59,130
and seriously report it to the police.

234
00:10:59,130 --> 00:11:00,920
It's even better if you can follow the clues

235
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:02,800
and catch all those frauds.

236
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:03,560
I will.

237
00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:04,880
Thank you for providing

238
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,440
this material to me today.

239
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,880
We should be the ones thanking you.

240
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:09,560
You helped us a great deal.

241
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:10,840
Thank you, President Dong.

242
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,200
Just talk to me here.

243
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,600
Why do we need to go outside?

244
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,480
There are things

245
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,760
you can't discuss in front of the kids, right?

246
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:42,400
Then let's wait until they fall asleep.

247
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:44,840
I can't just

248
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:46,400
leave them alone at home.

249
00:11:46,930 --> 00:11:47,770
Rest assured.

250
00:11:47,770 --> 00:11:49,560
I have sent messages to your husband on WeChat

251
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:50,680
and told him to come back.

252
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:55,120
Why didn't you inform me first?

253
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:55,880
Even if I did,

254
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:57,880
you wouldn't agree.

255
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,440
Alright. Just listen to me.

256
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,200
Okay?

257
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,560
Later on, leave the kids to him

258
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,120
when he is back.

259
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:05,680
Get changed and leave with me.

260
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:06,920
Stay at my place tonight.

261
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,760
I have to talk to you properly.

262
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:10,360
But you have no idea.

263
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:13,000
The last time he attended to the kids alone, 
 things went wrong.

264
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:13,760
Tell me, what if...

265
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:14,400
What if?

266
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,960
Don't overthink.

267
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:17,960
He must have learned from his mistakes.

268
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,320
I'm back.

269
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,400
Dad.

270
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,400
Wash your hands and have dinner.

271
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,680
Dad, hug me now.

272
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:30,960
Dad.

273
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:33,640
Dad, where did you go in the past few days?

274
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:34,960
I was on a business trip.

275
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:35,680
Dad.

276
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,120
Will you leave again?

277
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:38,640
That

278
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:39,720
depends on my supervisor.

279
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,040
I'll get changed.

280
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:47,480
I need to go out with your mom.

281
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:48,880
Be good at home.

282
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:49,320
OK.

283
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:50,200
Aunt Shan,

284
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:51,920
will you and mom

285
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,360
come back soon?

286
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,200
I can't

287
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,760
allow your mom to come back.

288
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,040
Because your mom

289
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:59,360
will stay at my place tonight.

290
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,680
Alright.

291
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:01,680
Aunt Shan,

292
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,520
I promise I will be really good.

293
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:04,240
Okay.

294
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:05,760
I

295
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,400
put my hands up and promise it.

296
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:07,840
Be good.

297
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:08,440
Mom

298
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:09,920
Here're hand hearts.

299
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:10,440
Love you.

300
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:12,180
Hand hearts. I love you.

301
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:12,880
Alright, enough.

302
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,440
Wash your hands and eat dinner now.

303
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:15,240
OK.

304
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,400
Be good.

305
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:21,840
Let's eat.

306
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:32,080
I have understood what you said.

307
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,200
Thank you, Shanshan.

308
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,440
But this is a challenge for me.

309
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:48,160
I know I have to go through it.

310
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:50,600
For the sake of this family,

311
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:51,600
the sake of the kids

312
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,590
and the sake of myself,

313
00:13:52,590 --> 00:13:53,840
I have to go through it.

314
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:56,560
Si Meng,

315
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:59,560
I really think you're so much happier than I am.

316
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,800
Do you understand what challenge means?

317
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:07,240
If you got the opposite result from it,

318
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:09,760
it's barely enough a challenge.

319
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,440
But almost everything is settled now.

320
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:12,920
At most,

321
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:15,760
it's just a glitch in your life.

322
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,080
When I

323
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,480
look at it now, it is just a glitch.

324
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:22,080
But the challenge I'm talking about

325
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:24,360
is not just this matter.

326
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:27,400
Is there anything else I need to know?

327
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:31,560
I think Wei Lan is just like a magnifier

328
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:34,320
showing me

329
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,560
the real problems between me and Du Shijun.

330
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,480
It's about distorted family relationships

331
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:43,800
and toxic ways of living.

332
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:48,280
You're so worthy of

333
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:50,200
a top student majoring in Chinese.

334
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:52,720
Can you not concoct worry to compose poems?

335
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:55,560
If you have unhealthy and toxic family relations,

336
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:57,520
how would those in true adversity

337
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:58,640
feel about this?

338
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:00,040
I'm not pretentious.

339
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:02,320
I'm not being unreasonable, either.

340
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,360
Over the past few days

341
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:10,760
when Du Shijun wasn't back,

342
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:14,000
I've been thinking

343
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:17,000
about why this matter affects me so much.

344
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,400
The impact is so big that when I want to 
 go through it again,

345
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:20,440
even my

346
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:21,720
hair stands on end.

347
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:23,880
My conclusion is that

348
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,120
my family relationship is distorted.

349
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:29,200
I have been putting myself down too much.

350
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:33,000
I have devoted everything I have to this family.

351
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,240
This family is all I have.

352
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:39,600
I don't have a way of escape.

353
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,720
Apart from Du Shijun cheating,

354
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:43,520
if anything happens to either Zhuang

355
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:44,400
or Yuan,

356
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:46,200
it would totally crush me.

357
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:47,600
I can't stand

358
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,440
signs of trouble anymore.

359
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,360
I'm swayed by considerations of gain and loss.

360
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,160
I look like

361
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,040
a grumbling prickly woman.

362
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:58,520
That's the true challenge I'm talking about.

363
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:02,520
What do you plan to do to go through it?

364
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,520
I have no idea.

365
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:16,280
When I said you're unreasonable,

366
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:17,760
you didn't admit it.

367
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:19,000
Let me give you an example.

368
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,440
When we hold a shareholders meeting

369
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:21,920
and someone proposes a scheme,

370
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,560
I have to speak my mind

371
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:24,960
and give corresponding

372
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:27,120
suggestions if I disagree.

373
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,480
Do you know what it's called?

374
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,240
Bury the victims if you commit murder.

375
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:31,920
If you raise a question

376
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:32,970
but don't give a solution,

377
00:16:32,970 --> 00:16:34,840
you refuse to bury the victim after killing him.

378
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:36,600
Then what?

379
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:39,560
You need to digest this through

380
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:44,720
a process with time.

381
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,000
I need courage, too.

382
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:49,160
Of course, you do.

383
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:52,120
I don't want to stay like this anymore.

384
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:54,440
We have to change the relationship.

385
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,520
I graduated from a famous university

386
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:00,040
but ended up a professional housewife.

387
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:01,320
I'm not content with it.

388
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:03,800
I'm not living a happy life.

389
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:05,440
I do not wish to be

390
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:07,800
a parasite totally depending on my husband,

391
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,720
dying if he abandons me.

392
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,480
If I continue to live like this,

393
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,079
I'd definitely go mad.

394
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:18,680
Is it your first time thinking about this?

395
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:19,520
No.

396
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:21,440
I thought about this a long time ago.

397
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,319
What happened then?

398
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:24,640
I just swallowed it back.

399
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:25,640
Therefore,

400
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:26,800
Wei Lan

401
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:28,280
was like a match

402
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:31,560
that set off the explosion of this idea again.

403
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:33,560
Si Meng.

404
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,000
Look at how old your kids are.

405
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,720
What were you doing before?

406
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:40,160
Listen,

407
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,560
talking about it is enough.

408
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:42,880
When the sun rises tomorrow,

409
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:43,610
you're still you

410
00:17:43,610 --> 00:17:44,880
and Du Shijun is still him.

411
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:47,000
Enjoy your life, okay?

412
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:49,120
It's easy to talk about changes,

413
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,080
but who succeeds

414
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:52,280
in changing without getting hurt badly?

415
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:54,920
You're not a tough person.

416
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:58,840
Also,

417
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:01,280
do you really think it's easy to be a housewife?

418
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,200
Can all living creatures do it well?

419
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,160
You'd be despising housewives if you think like that.

420
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,560
I'm not despising housewives.

421
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:07,600
I'm despising myself.

422
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:08,680
I look down on myself.

423
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:10,160
Alright.

424
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,240
Let me tell you the truth.

425
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,880
When Du Shijun came to me the other day,

426
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,720
I was really moved by his sincerity.

427
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,280
Both of you love this family so dearly.

428
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:26,120
So I would like to believe that he hasn't fallen in love 
 with someone else.

429
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:27,920
I can't stand seeing such a perfect family

430
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:29,400
destroyed by a woman like that.

431
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,240
That's why I'm willing to help you through.

432
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,000
I won't stop you from despising yourself.

433
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,480
But I have to tell you

434
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:36,520
that the truth

435
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:38,080
of this matter has been revealed.

436
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:39,800
Before you come up

437
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:42,000
with a plan to change the current situation,

438
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:44,640
just enjoy your life, okay?

439
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,440
Alright?

440
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:49,480
Alright.

441
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:51,360
Then stop thinking about this,

442
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:52,240
okay?

443
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,160
I have finally fulfilled my job

444
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:56,800
as a neighborhood committee staff.

445
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:57,720
Let's go to sleep.

446
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:00,040
Don't sleep now.

447
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:00,890
Let's talk a bit more.

448
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:02,140
What else should we talk about?

449
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:03,560
Look at the time, sis.

450
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,440
What should I do tomorrow?

451
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:07,920
What do you mean?

452
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:10,080
I still need to meet her again.

453
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:13,840
My dear sis,

454
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:16,320
why are you still insisting?

455
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:17,840
Wei Lan isn't pregnant.

456
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:18,880
Your husband didn't cheat.

457
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,840
That's the end of it.

458
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:22,080
Take your time to think about

459
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:23,620
the distorted and toxic relationship.

460
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:24,880
Why do you want to meet her?

461
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,360
Before I hear the truth directly from her,

462
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:30,680
I haven't beaten her for real.

463
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,520
You have won.

464
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:34,560
My dear sis.

465
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:37,920
Do you have to see her?

466
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:38,680
Yes.

467
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:45,160
Then you really need to have good acting skills tomorrow.

468
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,120
How should I act?

469
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:47,000
Can you smile?

470
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:14,560
Who is it?

471
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:16,240
It's me.

472
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:23,400
Hi.

473
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,200
Please put the package outside the door.

474
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:38,200
What do you want?

475
00:20:40,430 --> 00:20:41,560
Why did you make that noise?

476
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:42,840
Go straight to the point.

477
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:44,960
Just let me get in the room.

478
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:46,200
No.

479
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:48,000
It's not convenient.

480
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:49,880
My boyfriend is here.

481
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:52,840
Then it's my chance to meet him.

482
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:54,160
As his predecessor,

483
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,640
I have to show him the ropes, right?

484
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:57,400
There's no need.

485
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:59,800
He takes care of me so much better than you.

486
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:03,000
Why are you covering your nose?

487
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,760
You're so much stinkier than my feet.

488
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:05,400
Alright.

489
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,160
I won't joke now, Xue.

490
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:09,240
Last time,

491
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:10,200
it was my fault.

492
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:10,880
I was wrong.

493
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:11,680
I apologize to you.

494
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:14,000
I've been missing you a lot these days.

495
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:16,400
Don't be angry,

496
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,120
okay?

497
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:22,480
That's it?

498
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:28,680
Let me ask you.

499
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:31,720
Why didn't you come to me earlier?

500
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,120
I was busy at work in the company.

501
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,320
I even went on a business trip.

502
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:39,720
So, work is more important for you.

503
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:40,840
Sure.

504
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:42,400
I wish you

505
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,280
great promotion

506
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:45,400
and a good career.

507
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,000
Bye-bye.

508
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:47,080
Wait.

509
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:51,400
Xue.

510
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:54,760
I...

511
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:47,160
I need some nice fragrance at home.

512
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:49,000
Bring me back the flowers.

513
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:49,640
I...

514
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:01,440
I'll be back soon. Wait for me.

515
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:27,160
Is anyone in?

516
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:48,280
Xue.

517
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:50,570
What took you so long?

518
00:23:50,570 --> 00:23:52,570
Alright, there's no need to give me the flowers.

519
00:23:52,570 --> 00:23:53,240
I'm sleepy.

520
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:55,040
Go back. Bye-bye.

521
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:02,840
He really thought I need the flower.

522
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:05,520
He came back to you. What else do you expect?

523
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:07,960
He really pissed me a lot.

524
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:09,480
What did he do exactly?

525
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,400
From what I know about him,

526
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,080
he must have gotten pissed and threw away

527
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,520
the flowers the moment he went out.

528
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,100
Then, when he heard that I wanted the flowers,

529
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:18,640
he hurried to find a place for new ones.

530
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:21,800
Why is he so funny?

531
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,000
Tell me, sis.

532
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,240
Is he stupid or what?

533
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:26,800
He's fine.

534
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,200
At least, he is honest.

535
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,280
He has

536
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:31,920
a relatively high IQ,

537
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:33,720
but his EQ is killing me.

538
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:36,720
Just quit while you're ahead.

539
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,240
You can't stop caring about each other.

540
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:39,640
Don't act up.

541
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:40,680
These days,

542
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:41,840
I will organize a meeting.

543
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:42,960
Let's meet up together.

544
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:44,440
It doesn't work like that.

545
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:47,160
He thinks that he can get away with it

546
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:48,640
if he randomly butters me up.

547
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,480
I won't give him an out.

548
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,000
You're exhilarated, aren't you?

549
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:53,800
What do you want, then?

550
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:57,280
Unless he promises to me

551
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:58,480
that he won't

552
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:00,340
do such things ever again in front of everyone,

553
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:01,840
there's no need to discuss.

554
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,360
These are her original words.

555
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:06,080
Do as you see fit.

556
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:06,720
Alright.

557
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:07,600
I see.

558
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:08,720
Thanks.

559
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:09,800
Bye.

560
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:30,440
Do you remember?

561
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:32,520
There're eight words.

562
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:33,280
Be tepid, not angry.

563
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:34,690
Neither humble nor arrogant.

564
00:25:36,150 --> 00:25:38,100
I'll wait for you over there on the second floor.

565
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:39,560
Here she comes.

566
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:40,520
Qinghao, right?

567
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:54,960
What do you want?

568
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:57,320
Don't be afraid.

569
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:59,320
I just want to talk to you.

570
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:01,000
I'm not afraid.

571
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,120
I have nothing to tell you.

572
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:04,240
Then I'll go upstairs and stay for a bit in your company.

573
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:06,080
Wait.

574
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,960
Without knowing your background,

575
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,560
I wouldn't have come to you.

576
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,400
Are you threatening me?

577
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:21,320
Of course.

578
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:23,480
I am threatening you.

579
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:26,440
Let's go over there.

580
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,000
We should have a drink and chat.

581
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:15,480
Here.

582
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:16,280
Help yourself.

583
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,120
Order anything you want.

584
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:19,320
There's no need.

585
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:20,670
I'll go when we finish talking.

586
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:23,600
Two cups of water for now, please.

587
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:25,400
I want icy water.

588
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,120
She will have

589
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:27,520
a cup of hot water.

590
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:28,800
She can't drink cold stuff.

591
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:30,000
Alright. Please wait a moment.

592
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:30,880
Thanks.

593
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:51,240
How's your new job?

594
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:53,680
Go straight to the point.

595
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,200
You're so young and impatient.

596
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,480
I just want to ask you about one thing.

597
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,800
Does this new company

598
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:03,200
know that you are pregnant?

599
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,520
None of your business.

600
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,680
I'm really confused.

601
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:09,240
Don't you have to hand in the medical report 
upon onboarding?

602
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:10,880
If they knew that you are pregnant,

603
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,640
they wouldn't have hired you, right?

604
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,440
These capitalists

605
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:15,720
will never allow employees to take

606
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:17,850
maternity leave not long after getting on board, right?

607
00:28:17,850 --> 00:28:18,800
I'll say it again.

608
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,600
It's none of your business.

609
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:22,480
Thanks.

610
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:31,200
To tell you the truth,

611
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:33,120
when you

612
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:35,800
sent me this the other day,

613
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:37,480
I was indeed pissed.

614
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:39,480
But he totally refused to admit it

615
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:41,560
and wouldn't tell me anything about you.

616
00:28:41,790 --> 00:28:43,520
When I was worried that there's no proof,

617
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:45,320
you sent me this again.

618
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:48,040
It's exactly what I wanted.

619
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:49,400
That day, I slapped him hard

620
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:51,680
in the face the moment he arrived home.

621
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:52,720
I didn't expect that

622
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:55,160
I slapped the truth out of him.

623
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:56,880
He said he refused you

624
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,010
and kept trying to run away.

625
00:28:58,010 --> 00:28:59,800
You forced him to do it.

626
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:01,280
He felt wronged.

627
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:02,600
Then,

628
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:05,200
he also told me the details of what happened between you.

629
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:08,200
Even I was really embarrassed.

630
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:10,760
Then I thought it's okay

631
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:12,770
to swallow a bitter pill and not talk about it.

632
00:29:12,770 --> 00:29:13,840
However, I thought about it.

633
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:14,720
I don't think

634
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:18,080
you managed to take liberties.

635
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:22,280
Why is he so shameless?

636
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:23,160
I think

637
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:24,960
I still have to call your company

638
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,490
and tell them about your pregnancy.

639
00:29:26,490 --> 00:29:27,400
You and your husband

640
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:29,040
both love to destroy my future, right?

641
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:31,480
You have wronged me.

642
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:33,160
I really mean no harm.

643
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:35,160
I think the new company you're in

644
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:36,480
has a lot of workloads.

645
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:38,760
It's bad for the fetus.

646
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:40,080
You're all alone.

647
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:41,440
Without a husband,

648
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:43,080
it's not easy at all to carry a baby.

649
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:53,280
Look at me.

650
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:58,080
Do you want me to make the phone call?

651
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:02,720
The truth is

652
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,640
nothing happened between me and him that day.

653
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:13,320
Because of Mr. Du,

654
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:14,840
I couldn't stay in the firm.

655
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:17,200
I tried to get him on my side,

656
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:19,680
but he humiliated me time after time.

657
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:21,480
That's why I decided to do so.

658
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:25,440
He made me lose my job.

659
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:27,000
I just wanted to cause trouble.

660
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:29,080
I didn't expect you solved the case.

661
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:35,280
Did you spend a few hundred RMB

662
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:36,520
on this diagnosis?

663
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:38,440
You really don't care about the investment.

664
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:40,920
You're bad if you harm others to profit yourself.

665
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:42,480
With conscience, you can still be saved.

666
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,520
You're stupid if you harm others and yourself.

667
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:47,000
That requires a good education from reality.

668
00:30:47,210 --> 00:30:48,880
Which type do you think you belong to?

669
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:52,480
You seduced your superior

670
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:53,880
and fortified a diagnosis.

671
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:55,240
With these pieces of evidence,

672
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:56,200
you won't get away with it

673
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:57,670
whether I report them to the police

674
00:30:57,670 --> 00:30:59,060
or the leaders in your company.

675
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:02,000
You're so young.

676
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,560
You don't think about the consequences.

677
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:04,960
You'd do anything

678
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,160
to vent your spleen.

679
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:08,000
But you have to remember this.

680
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:10,160
The world will treat you

681
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:11,800
in the same way you treat the world.

682
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:23,000
I apologize to you.

683
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:26,280
Please don't tell my company about it.

684
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:37,640
Let me also tell you the truth.

685
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,440
I planned to come here

686
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:43,080
and get my revenge.

687
00:31:43,270 --> 00:31:44,960
Because I have all the evidence about you

688
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:46,760
and I can finally fight back.

689
00:31:51,650 --> 00:31:53,080
However, I found out that this job

690
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:54,680
is probably really important to you.

691
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:57,480
You lowered your head

692
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:59,760
and apologized to me for this job.

693
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:01,080
You even asked me to forgive you.

694
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:06,040
I start to pity you all of a sudden.

695
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:13,640
But it doesn't stop me from hating you.

696
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:17,240
I hope

697
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:19,240
that you apologized because

698
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:20,360
you did something wrong,

699
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:22,120
not because you're forced

700
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:23,080
to apologize out of fear.

701
00:32:32,090 --> 00:32:33,200
If nothing goes wrong,

702
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:35,160
this should be the last time that we meet.

703
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:37,600
Please

704
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:40,720
never ever appear in my life again.

705
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:41,760
Otherwise, I won't

706
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:43,440
talk to you with such good manners again.

707
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:45,200
This is the end of it.

708
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:46,530
Go.

709
00:32:46,530 --> 00:32:47,400
Are you going to...

710
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:49,240
Can you not understand the meaning of an end?

711
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:53,240
Thank you.

712
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:01,560
I'm sorry.

713
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:18,040
How was it?

714
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:20,160
You're so excellent.

715
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:24,280
You told me

716
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:25,240
not to burn the bridges.

717
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:34,080
You've heard what you wanted

718
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:35,600
and said what you intended.

719
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:37,280
Why do you still look so unhappy?

720
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:40,280
Shanshan.

721
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:43,080
Just now,

722
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:44,560
I saw her figure and appearance

723
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:46,320
and felt she is so young.

724
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:48,560
I do think I'm getting old.

725
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:50,080
If Du Shijun cheated,

726
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:51,560
it wouldn't be surprising.

727
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:52,120
See?

728
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:53,000
There you go again.

729
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,080
Have you finished?

730
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:56,920
Yes, I have.

731
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:58,760
Let's have lunch.

732
00:33:59,120 --> 00:33:59,640
Come on.

733
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:02,920
I haven't been eating for days.

734
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:04,400
I was so pissed.

735
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:06,880
We need to have a big meal tonight.

736
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:10,639
Where should we go?

737
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:11,840
Where else?

738
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,199
Crossroad Bistro, of course.

739
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:19,639
[A harmonious family is the key to success.
 See you at Crossroad Bistro at 7 PM.]

740
00:34:22,679 --> 00:34:23,480
Xiaoyu.

741
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:24,280
I'll leave.

742
00:34:25,030 --> 00:34:26,719
Do you have to be away for two weeks?

743
00:34:27,239 --> 00:34:28,120
I'll try to be quick.

744
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:30,320
Be good.

745
00:34:33,719 --> 00:34:34,560
One more kiss.

746
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:36,600
I'll go.

747
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:38,800
Bye-bye.

748
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:41,400
Eat less junk food.

749
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:42,120
OK.

750
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:49,960
Have you thought it through?

751
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:51,560
That doesn't matter.

752
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,679
I'll butter her up for now.

753
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:56,320
I believe that

754
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:57,560
she can definitely understand me.

755
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,600
I've been thinking about nothing but her.

756
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:03,480
Keep these sappy words for my sis.

757
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:05,520
Come to the restaurant tonight.

758
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:06,760
It's a reunion dinner.

759
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:08,200
A reunion dinner?

760
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:10,560
Is it just for me?

761
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:11,960
Don't be so nosy.

762
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:12,960
Will you be there?

763
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:14,040
I have to be there.

764
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:16,040
Come in.

765
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:16,880
I'll hang up now.

766
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:20,520
Keep your voice down.

767
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:22,160
I heard everything.

768
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:24,840
Where are you going?

769
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:26,480
You have to be there?

770
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:27,760
To meet my girlfriend.

771
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:29,800
Did you make up?

772
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:30,920
It's not making up.

773
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:32,560
Nothing wrong happened to begin with.

774
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:33,720
Come on.

775
00:35:33,910 --> 00:35:35,560
Look at yourself in the past few days.

776
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:36,560
You were so spiritless,

777
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:38,000
saddened and discouraged all day long.

778
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,600
I saw through you.

779
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:46,400
Let me ask you something serious.

780
00:35:46,670 --> 00:35:48,680
Where are the design sketches our clients want?

781
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:49,400
Here.

782
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:51,400
Can you just them to me?

783
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:52,690
Bro, it's been four days.

784
00:35:52,690 --> 00:35:54,600
I will give them to you before getting off work.

785
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:55,880
Is that a promise?

786
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:56,880
Yes.

787
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:01,040
Joy puts heart into a man.

788
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:05,680
Hurry up.

789
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:07,400
Don't go home if you can't finish it.

790
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:14,720
They're here.

791
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:15,920
Can you see your brother?

792
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:16,840
Look.

793
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:19,640
Brother.

794
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:21,040
Be careful.

795
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:22,840
Go on. Go to your mom.

796
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:23,400
Dad.

797
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:24,960
Hi, you're Zhuang's dad.

798
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:25,400
Hi, Ms. Zhang.

799
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:26,400
Go on, baby.

800
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:27,360
Brother.

801
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:28,680
Come on. Let's get on the side.

802
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:30,480
Do you have a lot of homework today?

803
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:31,360
Not a lot.

804
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:33,760
I have finished them at school.

805
00:36:33,820 --> 00:36:35,320
Then let's have dinner in a restaurant.

806
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:36,960
Alright.

807
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:39,080
What are you waiting for? Let's go.

808
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:40,160
Where's mom?

809
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:41,480
She is waiting for us in the restaurant.

810
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:42,840
Hurry up, then.

811
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:43,960
Mom.

812
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:53,680
Dad,

813
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:55,480
have you stopped

814
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:56,920
arguing with mom?

815
00:36:58,640 --> 00:36:59,680
Did we ever argue?

816
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:01,720
Don't think of me as a kid, okay?

817
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:03,480
I know that you quarreled.

818
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:08,440
Alright.

819
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:09,920
You're a big boy now, son.

820
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:11,200
You know everything.

821
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:14,280
Don't worry.

822
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:15,560
We won't argue anymore.

823
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:17,840
That's good, then.

824
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:19,360
The most stupid thing is

825
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:21,760
to quarrel with someone you love.

826
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:25,000
Are you teaching me a lesson?

827
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,120
Of course.

828
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:29,600
OK.

829
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:32,600
Everyone,

830
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:33,800
I'll say something first.

831
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:36,200
We brought a lot of trouble

832
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:38,040
to you for what happened,

833
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:39,680
especially Shanshan.

834
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:41,960
If it wasn't for you,

835
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:44,000
there would be nothing I can do to clear my name.

836
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:46,560
We would probably still be in a cold war

837
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:47,200
or even

838
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:48,480
in a worse status.

839
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:50,840
I won't talk too much.

840
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:51,800
Thank you.
