4
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,079
I want to fly.

5
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:24,600
I want to fly.

6
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,000
Excellent!

7
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,400
Mom!

8
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,079
I got three stars in Banma AI English again!

9
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,400
Good girl!

10
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,200
Keep it up.

11
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,040
OK.

12
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:37,320
Mom!

13
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,120
I've finished my homework.

14
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:40,440
All of it?

15
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,560
I got my math homework done.

16
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:43,720
And I have two Chinese compositions to go.

17
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:44,840
But I don't want to do it today.

18
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,280
All right. Take a rest.

19
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,160
Anyway, school will start soon.

20
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,360
What you do with it is your business.

21
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:51,560
Got it.

22
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,040
Mom, I want to play video games.

23
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,200
I'd like to use Dad's computer.

24
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:55,560
Video games again?

25
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,320
You play them every day.

26
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,480
You want to be short-sighted?

27
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:07,280
Go ahead.

28
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:04,600
There there. Don't be sad.

29
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,240
Xiaoyu's words were hurtful.

30
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:10,600
But you need to understand her.

31
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,880
If the situation weren't reversed,

32
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,840
she would lose her job.

33
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,640
I don't blame her.

34
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,240
Then who do you blame?

35
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,760
Yourself?

36
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:26,240
We can't punish ourselves
for others' mistakes.

37
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,040
Right?

38
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,760
I know you're sad.

39
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:33,360
And I know you don't want to let go.

40
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,840
But what could you do?

41
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,320
He's gone.

42
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:45,200
Ten years.

43
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,920
I need some time to deal with it.

44
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:49,080
I can't give you time.

45
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:54,360
You need to be occupied with things,

46
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,760
so you are too busy to think nonsense.

47
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:03,120
We have our own mountains to climb.

48
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,800
But this time,

49
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:06,680
no one can help you.

50
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:07,840
You can only rely on yourself.

51
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,360
We've known each other for a long time.

52
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,200
Have you seen me cry before?

53
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:19,960
If you want to cry,

54
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,160
cry on my shoulder.

55
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:22,880
Okay?

56
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,200
Let it all out.

57
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:31,120
Come on.

58
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,480
There, there.

59
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:34,880
Feel free to cry.

60
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,159
After finishing crying,

61
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:38,280
you can wash your face, put on makeup,

62
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:41,920
and be pretty.

63
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:42,640
After leaving here,

64
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:44,760
you'll still be the general manager
of Crossroad Bistro.

65
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,200
Okay?

66
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,000
Quiet, please.

67
00:05:54,159 --> 00:05:55,600
May I have your attention?

68
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:56,720
Before we get started,

69
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,360
may I invite Mr. Du
to deliver an opening speech?

70
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,520
Come on.

71
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,120
Welcome.

72
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:06,920
All right.

73
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,960
I just want to say a few words.

74
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,080
You've been busy for half a year.

75
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,280
This dinner

76
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:15,320
is a reward for you.

77
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:17,680
Why today?

78
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:18,920
It's not a special occasion.

79
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:19,800
It's just that

80
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:21,840
four of our colleagues

81
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,200
will take a business trip this weekend.

82
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:23,880
Yes.

83
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:25,240
So, carpe diem!

84
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,240
Enjoy ourselves.

85
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,960
But don't miss work tomorrow.

86
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:29,400
All right?

87
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,520
Mr. Du, don't worry.

88
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,159
In the past year, our department

89
00:06:32,159 --> 00:06:33,840
ranked second in terms of performance.

90
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:34,880
This can't be realized

91
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,920
without the brilliant leadership of Mr. Du.

92
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,080
It's all thanks to Mr. Du's leadership

93
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:38,960
that we can make headway.

94
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:39,440
Is it right?

95
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:40,200
Yes.

96
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,600
Let's toast Mr. Du.

97
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:42,680
Come on.

98
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,800
You need to drink Baijiu. Come on.

99
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,040
Here's to Mr. Du!

100
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,200
Here's to everyone.

101
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:48,480
Cheers.

102
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,120
Let's eat!

103
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:54,159
Wu Qing.

104
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,159
Cheers.

105
00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:00,040
You've passed the intern program.

106
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,480
Welcome to our team.

107
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:02,640
Thank you.

108
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,200
Keep up the good work.

109
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,080
Good.

110
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:15,640
Mom.

111
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,120
Why are you not eating?

112
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,360
I am.

113
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,600
You need to eat more.

114
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:35,760
Mom.

115
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:37,040
What's wrong with you?

116
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:39,680
Nothing.

117
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:43,080
Why did you wash it again and again?

118
00:07:45,159 --> 00:07:46,600
The stain can't be removed.

119
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,440
Have you finished?

120
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:51,480
Yes.

121
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,360
Me, too.

122
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,960
Yuanyuan, go watch cartoon.

123
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,000
Mom.

124
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:57,840
I want to play three more rounds.

125
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,480
The last three rounds.

126
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,000
Fine.

127
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:01,440
Go ahead.

128
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,560
Once you're finished,

129
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,920
go back to your room and read.

130
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,120
Go watch cartoon.

131
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,000
But only one episode.

132
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:09,120
Mom.

133
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,880
Are you upset?

134
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:18,160
No, I'm not.

135
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:20,000
I'm happy.

136
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,240
Dad said that

137
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:25,120
the man of virtue should be undemonstrative.

138
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,680
Do you even know what that word means?

139
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,400
It means that

140
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:33,400
people can't tell if you're happy or not.

141
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:36,320
You know everything.

142
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:38,200
You can tell I'm upset.

143
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:41,080
It proves I'm not a man of virtue, right?

144
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,360
That saying is only suitable for men.

145
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:44,720
But Mom,

146
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:45,520
you are a woman.

147
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:47,320
So it should be,

148
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:50,240
"a woman needs to be undemonstrative."

149
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,200
Smart girl.

150
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,680
But I'm not upset.

151
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:58,000
Go watch cartoon.

152
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,520
OK.

153
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:29,400
Mr. Du.

154
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,440
Mr. Du.

155
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:35,400
This is our farewell dinner.

156
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,520
Thank you for your tolerance so far.

157
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:40,640
Bottoms up.

158
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,280
You...

159
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:43,920
You should thank

160
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,440
your mentors more.

161
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,800
You are their leader.

162
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:52,160
I also need to thank the leader of my mentors.

163
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,160
You drank a lot that day.

164
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:58,680
When you went home,

165
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:00,520
was your wife angry?

166
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,040
My wife

167
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:08,160
is not petty.

168
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,720
That is because she doesn't love you enough.

169
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,400
That is because she trusts me.

170
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,240
You don't understand.

171
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:19,320
Don't look down upon Gen Z.

172
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:22,320
We know as much as you millennials do.

173
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,920
You can't even

174
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,360
trust your colleagues a little bit.

175
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,720
Do you really think you understand

176
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:34,120
trust in marriage?

177
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,880
Show me her photo.

178
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:46,800
Why would I show you my wife's photo?

179
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:49,840
Because I want to know

180
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:54,680
what a sensible and tolerant wife

181
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:56,160
looks like.

182
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:21,080
Use your phone to take a photo of us.

183
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,800
Send it to her.

184
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,240
Wei Lan.

185
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:29,520
You can't tell if she is sensible from her face.

186
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:32,480
And tolerance isn't meant to be challenged.

187
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:35,160
You seem to lack

188
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:36,400
some family education.

189
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:37,880
But I don't blame you.

190
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:40,760
I know you want to stay.

191
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
But I can tell you explicitly

192
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:45,720
that you're not suitable for our firm.

193
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:48,280
It doesn't mean you're not good.

194
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:49,640
You are unsuitable.

195
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,160
Unsuitable.

196
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:52,840
Can you

197
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:54,120
understand this word?

198
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:00,200
Yes, I can.

199
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,360
So, I won't hesitate anymore.

200
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,160
I'll leave then.

201
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,240
You don't have to wait.

202
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,840
You can leave now.

203
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:09,800
Bro.

204
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:10,880
Did you drink too much?

205
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,000
Wei is a good girl.

206
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,800
Don't defend her.

207
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,600
Nobody in this room

208
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,280
is smarter than her.

209
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:22,880
Our industry requires rigor and steadiness.

210
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,320
Have I told you before?

211
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:30,120
No one here

212
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:32,600
is the best in this industry.

213
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,120
But why do I keep you in the firm?

214
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:36,480
This is because you are honest.

215
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:40,280
You mean I'm not honest?

216
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,280
Ask everyone.

217
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,240
Ask everyone.

218
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,360
You can ask everyone

219
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,120
about my attitude toward work

220
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:51,440
and how I've been treating them

221
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,360
for the past few months.

222
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:59,240
You have the right to dislike me.

223
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,960
You can have a problem with me.

224
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:03,080
But you can't insult me.

225
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,680
You are not happy, right?

226
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,680
Are you happy?

227
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,600
Yes, yes.

228
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,640
Then, I apologize to you.

229
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:21,040
Okay?

230
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:22,320
Sorry.

231
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:37,520
The number you have dialed 
is temporarily unavailable.

232
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:39,640
Please try again later.

233
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,480
Go home.

234
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:06,440
I'll take care of Mr. Du.

235
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,160
Go.

236
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,080
Mr. Du.

237
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:17,040
Mr. Du.

238
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,640
Mr. Du.

239
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:20,920
Wake up.

240
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:25,080
He's passed out.

241
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,280
Why not use his fingerprint to unlock the phone

242
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:30,720
and call his wife?

243
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:33,920
Who will make the phone call? You?

244
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,080
It would be inappropriate.

245
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:35,840
You do it.

246
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:36,800
No.

247
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:39,280
Mr. Du drank a lot once last year.

248
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:40,720
I sent him home.

249
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,520
His wife rained angry words down on me.

250
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,840
Does she not know what his job is like?

251
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:46,280
She does, of course.

252
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,880
But he was that drunk

253
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:49,200
and noisy at home.

254
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,520
He would inevitably bother the kids.

255
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:52,960
Mr. Du hasn't been that drunk for a while.

256
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,280
I don't know what's wrong today.

257
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:56,520
Wei.

258
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:59,320
His words are inappropriate today.

259
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:00,400
Don't take it to heart.

260
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,760
He's drunk.

261
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,200
I apologize to you on his behalf.

262
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:05,200
In wine, there is truth.

263
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,360
I know he has a problem with me.

264
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:08,360
But it doesn't matter.

265
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:09,960
I'll be out of his sight soon.

266
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:11,640
Mr. Du

267
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:14,840
is very strict with work.

268
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,360
It's nothing personal.

269
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,040
If he doesn't criticize me for a while,

270
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:19,240
I will feel at a loss.

271
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:20,000
I'm telling you.

272
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:22,600
All right.

273
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:23,400
Enough about that.

274
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:25,720
What should we do now?

275
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:26,840
He is that drunk.

276
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,520
We cannot leave him here.

277
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:33,000
I will go to reception to get a room.

278
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:34,880
Wait for me.

279
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,520
Then, you can help me get him to the room.

280
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:58,240
This way.

281
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:01,200
This way.

282
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,840
So heavy!

283
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:13,120
Wait. Let me get the room card.

284
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:18,400
Slow down. Be careful.

285
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:19,320
Be careful with his feet.

286
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:43,560
Glasses.

287
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:46,200
His phone.

288
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,600
Bag.

289
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:31,320
You know what? It has nothing to do with your abilities.

290
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:32,920
Wei Lan, for real.

291
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:34,680
I'll send you home.

292
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,440
No, thanks. I called a taxi.

293
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:37,240
See? I've already called.

294
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:38,400
No, cancel it.

295
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,320
I can drive you home.

296
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:39,760
No.

297
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:40,320
You don't have to.

298
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:41,040
Cancel it.

299
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:42,080
I'll get you home.

300
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:43,280
Here it comes.

301
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:44,600
See you.

302
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:46,080
Take care.

303
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:51,840
Take care.

304
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:53,920
Good luck.

305
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:55,280
Good luck.

306
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:56,760
Bye.

307
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:09,520
Sir.

308
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,560
I left something in the hotel.

309
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:13,200
Could you turn around?

310
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:13,960
No problem.

311
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:28,360
Mr. Du.

312
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,920
Why are you still up?

313
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:04,280
I'm waiting for you.

314
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:06,960
Why?

315
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:07,920
Go to bed.

316
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:08,800
What time is it?

317
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:10,240
You need to take the kids to school later.

318
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:11,440
Where have you been?

319
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:18,320
I drank a lot at the office party.

320
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,160
Yongjie

321
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:20,480
got me a room.

322
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:21,440
I slept for a while

323
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,120
to sober up.

324
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:24,280
When I woke up, it was morning already.

325
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,400
You slept alone?

326
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:28,280
Of course.

327
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:29,040
Who would I sleep with

328
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:29,800
if I didn't sleep alone?

329
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:30,520
Come on. Let's go to bed.

330
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:36,160
Go to bed with the red lips.

331
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:38,440
What red lips?

332
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:41,640
You are still acting, huh?

333
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:44,880
What are you talking about?

334
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,240
Why am I acting?

335
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:49,920
Your phone.

336
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:51,840
What?

337
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:53,680
Give it to me.

338
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:57,640
Could you tell me what you...

339
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:58,720
Give your phone to me.

340
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:00,600
All right. Be quiet.

341
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:07,040
Why can't I unlock it?

342
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:09,200
Did you delete my fingerprint?

343
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:11,680
Why would I do that?

344
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:12,880
Why would I delete your fingerprint?

345
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:19,920
It's greasy.

346
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:21,680
It's unlocked now.

347
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:31,080
What happened?

348
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:33,000
You've never gone through my phone before.

349
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,800
People can change.

350
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:40,720
You've cleaned up your phone, huh?

351
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,520
What do you mean?

352
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:45,960
Can we get to the point?

353
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:47,360
Get to the point?

354
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:48,120
Sure.

355
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,120
What are you doing?

356
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:55,760
Check out the collar.

357
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:03,160
What's wrong?

358
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:06,880
What is it?

359
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:09,840
Now you're asking me what it is.

360
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:12,360
Don't play dumb.

361
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:15,160
I have no idea at all.

362
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:18,000
All right. Du Shijun.

363
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:20,600
You'll never admit you're wrong.

364
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:23,120
I tried ketchup and jam today.

365
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:23,880
They can be removed.

366
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:24,920
But this stain cannot.

367
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:26,960
I'm going to tell you what it is.

368
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:28,080
It's a lipstick stain.

369
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,040
What are you doing?

370
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:35,800
I know.

371
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:36,800
I just remembered.

372
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:39,600
It's her!

373
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,440
She left lipstick on my clothes on purpose.

374
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:43,960
Now you remembered.

375
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:46,120
Right on time!

376
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:47,520
Who is she?

377
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:51,120
An intern in my company.

378
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:54,480
You've never mentioned her before.

379
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:56,680
Why did she do that?

380
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:57,520
I didn't tell you the reason

381
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:58,240
why I got drunk today.

382
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,840
She pissed me off.

383
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:01,320
That young lady

384
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:02,160
will do anything

385
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:03,400
to achieve her goal.

386
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:05,440
She...

387
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:06,640
She...

388
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,120
She is an intern, right?

389
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,000
Well.

390
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,160
I didn't sign to let her pass the program.

391
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:13,680
So, she can't stay.

392
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:15,000
She came to cozy up to me.

393
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,120
She wanted to stay in our department.

394
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:17,320
It's impossible.

395
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:18,720
I just said what I thought.

396
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:19,960
Maybe she got hurt by that.

397
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:20,840
This is her revenge.

398
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:22,360
Keep going on with your story.

399
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:27,920
It's not a story.

400
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:29,320
I swear to God.

401
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:31,000
Every word I said is true.

402
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:33,000
Young

403
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,280
and beautiful, right?

404
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:36,120
Don't talk like that.

405
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:39,120
Over these years,

406
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,880
I've been loyal to you.

407
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:44,240
Yes, my job

408
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,280
involves many social activities.

409
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:46,920
But at festivals and weekends,

410
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,600
all I think is to go home early

411
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:49,800
and spend time with you and the kids.

412
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:50,960
Right?

413
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:52,960
When I receive calls

414
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,160
or texts,

415
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:55,920
I never hide them from you,

416
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:56,640
right?

417
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:57,240
Even the late-night ones.

418
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:00,120
You have no reason to doubt me.

419
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:06,240
Is the result of her internship

420
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:08,240
determined by you alone?

421
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:09,640
There're so many people in your company.

422
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:11,120
Why didn't she take revenge on others?

423
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:12,240
Why didn't she take revenge on HR?

424
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:13,720
Why not take revenge on your partner?

425
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,480
Maybe you gave her a promise

426
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:18,120
and then went back on it.

427
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:19,560
You can't talk like that.

428
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:21,360
She fears nothing.

429
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:22,240
She'll do anything.

430
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:23,320
I won't be surprised.

431
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:25,480
She is

432
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:27,560
taking revenge.

433
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:29,080
If you don't trust me,

434
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:30,160
she will win.

435
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:31,640
She is evil.

436
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:32,880
But you can't fall into her trap.

437
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,840
Du Shaojun, stop playing the victim.

438
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:40,600
Haven't I given you enough trust
all these years?

439
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,760
It's my first time
to deal with this kind of thing.

440
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:45,240
Instead of asking you,

441
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:46,400
what else can I do, tolerating you?

442
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:49,840
Should I suck it up and reflect on

443
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:52,200
how overly tolerant I have been
 after you kick me out?

444
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:52,840
Huh?

445
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,840
I don't mean that.

446
00:26:58,160 --> 00:26:59,920
You are the hostess.

447
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:01,640
You can ask and I should answer.

448
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:02,640
But

449
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:05,760
you need to trust me.

450
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:06,320
Why don't you

451
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:08,640
let me explain?

452
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:28,600
You know what?

453
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,200
Go to my company with me tomorrow.

454
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:34,120
I will ask her to come.

455
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:36,120
We can confront each other.

456
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:36,960
Does it work for you?

457
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,200
You know I won't go.

458
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:39,080
I have dignity.

459
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,040
Right, you have dignity.

460
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:42,200
So do I.

461
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:42,920
So, why are we

462
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:44,400
bothering about that shameless woman?

463
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:48,840
Dear.

464
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:50,960
In God's name,

465
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:53,360
after falling in love with you,

466
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:55,280
there's no room in my heart for anyone else.

467
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,280
How about this?

468
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:06,800
Starting tomorrow,

469
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:08,120
no, from now on,

470
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:09,640
I'll be under your watch, 24/7.

471
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:12,000
Video-call me anytime.

472
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:13,120
I must answer every call.

473
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:14,720
I can't reject it for any reason.

474
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:17,840
If there're no social activities,

475
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:20,400
I will go home on time
to be with you and the kids.

476
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:21,440
If there are activities,

477
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:22,120
when I arrive,

478
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:23,240
I'll immediately video-call you.

479
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:24,760
I'll tell you everything

480
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:26,800
from the venue to the attendees, okay?

481
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,640
What will people think of me?

482
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:31,040
They'll say Mr. Du's wife is petty.

483
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:31,520
I don't care.

484
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:32,320
I just want my wife to be happy.

485
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:33,120
It's none of their business.

486
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:34,440
Knock it off.

487
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:37,240
I'm telling you.

488
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:39,480
If it happens again, I'll divorce you.

489
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:40,800
I won't listen to your explanation.

490
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:42,880
That's right.

491
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:43,680
Divorce me immediately.

492
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:45,600
I won't take a dime with me.

493
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:46,480
You keep the money.

494
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:47,720
I'll handle the mortgage, alright?

495
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:51,560
I'm not stupid.

496
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:52,880
I won't give you such an opportunity.

497
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:55,520
Hope you can keep your words.

498
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:59,320
Speaking of which,

499
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:01,880
I need to be clear

500
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:03,600
that in one case,

501
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:05,080
I can't answer your video call.

502
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:09,040
I can't answer it when I'm in the toilet.

503
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,600
You see, if you accidentally saw someone's husband,

504
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,240
she'd want to see me, too.

505
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:15,200
You're so annoying.

506
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:17,640
Don't be mad.

507
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:19,240
Go take a shower.

508
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:20,200
You smell like alcohol.

509
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:20,960
Stay away from the bedroom.

510
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:22,040
Okay.

511
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:22,840
I'll take a shower now.

512
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,480
I am so sorry.

513
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:28,400
You're up all night worrying about me.

514
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:32,160
Cheer up.

515
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:34,120
I'll go take a shower.

516
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:19,320
[Crossroad Bistro]

517
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:42,240
Aloha.

518
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:43,640
What are you doing?

519
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:46,240
Doing pilates.

520
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:49,280
You done?

521
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:51,040
Anytime.

522
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:52,680
Wait for me.

523
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:54,120
I'll take you to do something thrilling.

524
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:56,160
I'll be upfront.

525
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:57,800
I won't go bungee jumping.

526
00:30:58,560 --> 00:30:59,720
You'll like this one.

527
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,200
Okay.

528
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:04,560
See you later.

529
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:12,440
Where are you going?

530
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:13,480
What's wrong?

531
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:15,240
Stop it. We've got a proposal this afternoon.

532
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:16,880
I gave you the plan, didn't I?

533
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,400
You can handle the proposal by yourself.

534
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:22,960
You've been hiding in your office

535
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:25,360
and staring at your phone
 with a silly smile on your face.

536
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:26,640
Are you dating someone?

537
00:31:28,010 --> 00:31:28,960
You were spying on me?

538
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:30,480
Come on.

539
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:32,400
Do you think you're that important?

540
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:36,360
Tell me. What does she do?

541
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:38,000
She's an actress.

542
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:39,280
An actress?

543
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:41,480
Is she faithful? Showbiz is complicated.

544
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:42,760
There are faithful and unfaithful people

545
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:44,360
in every industry.

546
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:46,560
You work in an office, but are you faithful?

547
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:49,360
Am I not?

548
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:50,960
You're in your 40s and not married.

549
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:52,200
You get a new girlfriend every week.

550
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:53,640
Stop being mean.

551
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:54,560
Bye.

552
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:56,640
Always answer your phone!

553
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:58,440
Okay. I'll turn it off later.

554
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:11,520
Be honest with me.

555
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:13,120
Are you going to kidnap me and sell me?

556
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:15,080
Sell you? Come on.

557
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:16,240
I'd lose money for that.

558
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:17,400
Might as well keep you to myself.

559
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:20,160
Let's go auto racing today!

560
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:21,040
Auto racing?

561
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:36,200
That's a new girl.

562
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:39,800
Songyang, this is?

563
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:43,600
We've met before.

564
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:44,840
That was not her.

565
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:46,920
It was her.

566
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:48,560
Keep acting.

567
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:49,440
You guys.

568
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:50,120
Ignore them.

569
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:51,640
Niu, enough with the jokes.

570
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:53,520
Miss, Don't mind them.

571
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:54,920
They're always joking.

572
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:56,000
It's alright.

573
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,040
I've gotten a vaccination

574
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:58,800
and am now immune to vulgar language.

575
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:00,120
Stop joking.

576
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:00,760
Hop on.

577
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:02,960
Let's go.

578
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:06,840
Let's go!

579
00:33:07,800 --> 00:34:08,480
[Extreme sport: do not imitate without proper training.]

580
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:09,680
Let's go!

581
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:20,239
Xiaoyu!

582
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:29,480
May I help you?

583
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:32,719
I've been waiting for you for two days.

584
00:34:33,239 --> 00:34:34,520
I want to have a talk.

585
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:38,600
I don't think it's necessary.

586
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:43,840
I know you hate me.

587
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:46,520
But it'll only take you a minute.

588
00:34:47,159 --> 00:34:48,560
Just talk to me, okay?

589
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:51,199
Alright.

590
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:54,040
We need to have closure face to face.

591
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:55,239
Let's go to the bistro.

592
00:34:55,239 --> 00:34:56,280
Let's go there.

593
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:04,360
Actually, there's not much to talk about.

594
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:08,600
You know what I think.

595
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,120
I don't want to repeat to you

596
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:12,560
the things you've done to me.

597
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:14,920
This is it for us.

598
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:18,160
Say what's on your mind.

599
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:19,040
I'm needed at the bistro.

600
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:26,600
Xiaoyu, I know I've hurt you badly.

601
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:30,600
I'll show you something first.

602
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:32,760
Then you can decide.

603
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:42,520
I came back to Shanghai

604
00:35:43,340 --> 00:35:45,120
and took care

605
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:46,400
of all the paperwork.

606
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,400
This is the divorce certificate.

607
00:35:55,490 --> 00:35:56,540
The notary for my property.

608
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:58,400
They can have the house in Shanghai.

609
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:00,760
My business and property overseas

610
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,360
will belong to us.

611
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:08,720
This is the will.

612
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,360
If I die,

613
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:13,400
for whatever reason,

614
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:15,360
you and my daughter

615
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,600
will each inherit half of my property.

616
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:32,920
And this.

617
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,520
This is my future.

618
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:43,640
Here.

619
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:48,480
The notary and the will

620
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:50,560
take effect on the day we get married.

621
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:54,760
Xiaoyu, I love you truly.

622
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:57,840
I don't even know how I went through

623
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,560
the whole year without you.

624
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:02,640
I don't know

625
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:04,000
how much medicine to take for my recovery.

626
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,120
I don't know

627
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:06,360
where everything is in the house.

628
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:09,480
I can't live my life without you.

629
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:15,080
I made a mistake.

630
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:16,720
There's no excuse.

631
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:19,520
I just hope you can give me a second chance.

632
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:21,400
We were together for five years.

633
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:25,000
I don't believe...

634
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:29,280
I don't believe that you don't love me anymore.

635
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:32,280
I hurt you.

636
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:33,320
I'll try my best to make it up to you.

637
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:38,280
Besides,

638
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:42,550
I've registered a new company in China.

639
00:37:42,550 --> 00:37:43,640
I've rented an apartment.

640
00:37:44,190 --> 00:37:45,560
I'll travel between China and Norway.

641
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:48,040
If you want,

642
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:49,000
we can go back to Norway.

643
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:49,680
It's up to you.

644
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:53,040
I will be

645
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:54,120
wherever you are.

646
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:56,120
I'll go wherever you want to go.

647
00:37:58,320 --> 00:37:59,400
I just can't...

648
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:03,240
I can't afford to lose you again.

649
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,280
I do want these things you showed me.

650
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:13,280
I admit that I am materialistic.

651
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:15,040
I understand you, Xiaoyu.

652
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,000
You should be.

653
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:17,600
But now, I hate you even more.

654
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:21,000
Do you know why?

655
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:25,920
You could've done these long ago.

656
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:28,680
But you just have to do it

657
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:29,880
after you've hurt me.

658
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:33,200
What am I to you?

659
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:36,400
Why are you doing this to me?

660
00:38:57,720 --> 00:38:58,720
Forgive me.

661
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:01,880
Give me a second chance, please.

662
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:32,720
Forgive me.
