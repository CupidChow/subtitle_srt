00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:01,440
Granny,

5
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:02,840
let me peel an orange for you.

6
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,280
I bought them from JD.COM.

7
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,040
They're very sweet.

8
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:07,880
Did this man

9
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:10,320
play your father once?

10
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,240
Yes,

11
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,320
he played my father once.

12
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,320
Granny, you've got such good memories.

13
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,760
Ms. Bao,

14
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,160
aren't you booked for today?

15
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:20,480
I am.

16
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,560
I will go after lunch.

17
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,520
If you want to gain a new experience,

18
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,320
do it in the day.

19
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,040
Don't

20
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,520
drive out in the dark.

21
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,120
Right.

22
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,920
Or you'll have to wash your car
 in the middle of the night.

23
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,440
Alright, alright.

24
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:37,400
Sis,

25
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,360
when do you and Shanshan leave?

26
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,079
In a couple days.

27
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:43,560
We'll wait till she finishes her work.

28
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,880
I need to see some clients with Mr. Chai.

29
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,079
I'll drive you to the airport.

30
00:02:48,079 --> 00:02:48,680
It's alright.

31
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,280
Shanshan will pick me up.

32
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:52,280
Grandma.

33
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:54,720
I can't celebrate Lunar New Year with you.

34
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:58,720
Youngsters nowadays don't respect traditions.

35
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,360
You're even

36
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,000
celebrating Lunar New Year abroad.

37
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,560
I'll bring gifts to you.

38
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,160
What about my gifts?

39
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,240
You can buy yourself a gift.

40
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,920
I need to remind you.

41
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:10,920
If you leave,

42
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:14,000
you won't be able to make it to my wedding.

43
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,320
Quiet down!

44
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:20,240
Granny!

45
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:22,040
Are you really going to marry Dr. Lu?

46
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,120
Oh my god!

47
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,000
You guys are so cool!

48
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,640
Congratulations, Grandma!

49
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:27,680
I want to give you a kiss.

50
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:28,560
Kisses.

51
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,840
When I heard you shout,

52
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:34,160
I thought you two didn't approve of it.

53
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,400
Why would we?

54
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,240
Granny, I raise my hands and my legs to vote for yes!

55
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,720
Me, too!

56
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,760
Granny, look!

57
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:42,400
You've got eight votes now.

58
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,680
Nobody dares to disapprove!

59
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,440
Alright.

60
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:46,720
Granny.

61
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,040
When are you going to get the certificate?

62
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,079
A week after the New Year.

63
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,560
We'll go to city hall

64
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,520
right when it's open.

65
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,160
I'll be back before that.

66
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,079
I'll go there with you.

67
00:03:56,079 --> 00:03:57,280
Then, I'll go, too!

68
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:02,720
Granny, you're gonna be a bride!

69
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:08,680
Here's to you.

70
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:09,600
Cheers.

71
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:13,680
Why are you buying me dinner today?

72
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:20,399
Allow me to fill your glass.

73
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:21,880
Dad.

74
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,160
Here's the thing.

75
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,080
My sister and I

76
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,000
are both good kids, right?

77
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:27,760
Of course.

78
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,280
We've known about

79
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:31,040
you and Mrs. Bai

80
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,240
and we didn't disapprove of it,

81
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:32,760
right?

82
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:33,520
Yes.

83
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,960
It's been long since mom was gone.

84
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,680
We understand you

85
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,159
from the bottom of our hearts.

86
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:40,520
But,

87
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:42,000
Mrs. Bai and you

88
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,280
are old.

89
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,680
Just keep each other company.

90
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,000
But why do you have to get married?

91
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,200
Marriage

92
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,200
makes it official.

93
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,120
Nowadays,

94
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,400
there's a popular saying,

95
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,360
"If you just want to date someone but not marry her,

96
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:58,560
then you're a jerk!"

97
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:01,160
Now you know all the popular sayings.

98
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:02,880
Tell you what.

99
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,800
When it comes to people your age,

100
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,120
they won't think of you

101
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:08,200
as a jerk whether you get married or not.

102
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,200
Then, why not get married?

103
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,880
Can you try to be more empathetic?

104
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,400
How am I not empathetic?

105
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:15,760
Well.

106
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:17,360
If one day, you just...

107
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:18,600
Die?

108
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:18,960
Right?

109
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:19,680
Hold on, dad.

110
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:21,760
Don't say that!

111
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:22,560
Knock on wood.

112
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,480
Knock on it.

113
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,920
I mean...

114
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,560
If...

115
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:33,800
If one day,

116
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:34,440
you pass away,

117
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,000
then, on the...

118
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:36,760
This thing...

119
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:38,520
On this thing,

120
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:39,880
whose name

121
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:41,400
shall we engrave next to you?

122
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,480
Is it gonna be my mom

123
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,840
or Mrs. Bai?

124
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,800
I haven't thought about it.

125
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:46,800
See?

126
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:50,800
You can engrave

127
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,000
your mom's name on the left,

128
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:52,600
and Mrs. Bai's name

129
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,000
on the right.

130
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,040
My name will be in the middle.

131
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:56,320
Can you do that?

132
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,080
Both of them!

133
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,600
Dad, you're such a playboy.

134
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,120
How can you be that irresponsible?

135
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,280
If you've got both names on it,

136
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,240
then

137
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:07,400
whose name will be engraved on the tombstone of Mr. Bai?

138
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,280
Son,

139
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:13,280
I knew it.

140
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,000
You bought me dinner

141
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,200
for a reason.

142
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,480
I've thought about it.

143
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,640
When I am gone,

144
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:23,440
you can just scatter the ashes of your mom and me

145
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,680
into the ocean.

146
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:25,800
The ocean?

147
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:26,520
I can't do that!

148
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:27,280
Why not?

149
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,160
You can save on the gravesite.

150
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,040
It's not about saving.

151
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:31,920
The old saying is

152
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,000
"The deceased will only rest in peace when buried."

153
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,520
Not scattered into the ocean!

154
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:34,920
Besides,

155
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:35,800
where should we pay tribute to you

156
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:36,880
on tomb-sweeping day?

157
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,159
Should I just go to the beach

158
00:06:38,159 --> 00:06:38,760
and yell at the ocean

159
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:40,400
that I miss you?

160
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,480
I will be in your heart.

161
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,280
Dad,

162
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,080
just tell me

163
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:48,480
if there's any chance

164
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,720
that I can change your mind.

165
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,000
I am

166
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,400
as determined

167
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,560
as if my heart is made of iron!

168
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,000
An iron heart doesn't mean determined!

169
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:00,600
Dad!

170
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,160
I think you're

171
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,600
ironhearted to me!

172
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:05,360
Son.

173
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,960
Come on, drink with me!

174
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:11,040
Cheers.

175
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,280
Thank you for supporting me.

176
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,040
Come on.

177
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,400
I just can't with you.

178
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,200
Cheers.

179
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,360
Hello.

180
00:07:58,760 --> 00:07:59,600
Mom.

181
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,360
We've booked our flight back.

182
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,200
We'll leave three days before the Lunar New Year.

183
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:03,800
The flight is in the morning.

184
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,320
We'll be home by the afternoon.

185
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,360
Okay.

186
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,120
When will Qidong and Chengcheng

187
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,080
be back?

188
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:13,760
One day after you, around midday.

189
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:15,720
Mom.

190
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:19,120
You don't sound well to me.

191
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,360
Are you alright?

192
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:24,120
I have difficulty breathing.

193
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:27,120
My stomach hurts.

194
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,280
Did you catch a cold outside?

195
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:32,320
Drink some warm water

196
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,240
and see if it helps.

197
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,320
Besides,

198
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,280
who's with you at home?

199
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:40,480
Nobody.

200
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:41,320
Mom, listen to me.

201
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,080
Don't panic.

202
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,120
I'll call Xiaoyu right away

203
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,080
and ask her to come back.

204
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:46,840
Okay.

205
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:48,360
Alright.

206
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:50,240
Bye.

207
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:54,040
I am being serious.

208
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:55,840
When old people

209
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,240
encounter this situation,

210
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:59,680
it is very likely to be myocardial infarction.

211
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,480
Press your back

212
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:03,000
against the chair.

213
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,480
If you feel

214
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,360
stabbing

215
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,000
chest pain,

216
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,000
you need to

217
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,760
call for an ambulance right away.

218
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,320
Got it?

219
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,960
[Bao Xue]

220
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:50,080
[This is the end of Bai Jinghui's storyline.]

221
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,800
Chengcheng and I

222
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:44,240
were organizing your grandma's belongings

223
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,560
and found two letters

224
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,360
addressed to you two.

225
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,240
We will

226
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,480
read the letters

227
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,280
to

228
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,280
the both of you.

229
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:01,920
Sit down.

230
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:02,560
Sit.

231
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:21,520
The will.

232
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,000
After I die,

233
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:29,000
Houjiang and Chengcheng

234
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:31,200
shall bury me

235
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,920
with my husband Wangxi.

236
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,880
If Dr. Lu Zheng

237
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:37,040
is still alive,

238
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,080
please apologize to him

239
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:41,560
on my behalf.

240
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:43,320
We got to know each other

241
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:45,560
in our last years.

242
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:47,960
I, Bai Jinghui,

243
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,120
am utterly grateful.

244
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,400
I will repay his kindness in my next life.

245
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:55,800
I have a house

246
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,240
under my name.

247
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,200
I will give it to

248
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:01,760
my granddaughter

249
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,000
Dai Xiaoyu.

250
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:09,120
No one

251
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:12,840
shall object to this.

252
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:17,160
Signed by

253
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:19,920
Bai Jinghui.

254
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:47,160
Xue,

255
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:50,600
when you read this letter,

256
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:53,880
I will have already left you.

257
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,240
When you were a kid,

258
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,920
I asked you to call me Grandmother.

259
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:02,400
You said other kids would call Granny

260
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:05,360
and if you called me Grandmother,

261
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:06,800
they'd laugh at you.

262
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:10,640
So, you insisted on calling me Granny.

263
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:13,720
For all these years,

264
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:16,600
I've never told you that

265
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:20,440
I wanted to hear you call me Grandmother.

266
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:30,640
I am 74 years old now.

267
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:33,040
I am

268
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,240
at death's doorstep every day.

269
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:39,160
In case of leaving any disputes

270
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:40,760
for my descendants

271
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:43,480
if I die all of a sudden,

272
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:45,720
I asked the lawyers

273
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:47,200
to write my will

274
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,760
and had it notarized.

275
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:50,320
I will leave my house

276
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,680
to your sister Xiaoyu.

277
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,240
Xue,

278
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:59,120
please forgive Granny

279
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,320
for making this decision

280
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:03,240
without consulting you.

281
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,840
You were raised by me.

282
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,720
I care for you the most.

283
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,400
But I know that

284
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:13,600
no matter how generous

285
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,320
and considerate you are,

286
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,880
you will feel uncomfortable

287
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:20,160
when you see this will.

288
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:23,680
My girl,

289
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,800
I've lived a fulfilling and happy

290
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,680
life.

291
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:30,560
I am fulfilled

292
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:33,320
because I love my life.

293
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,280
I am happy because I have a warm family.

294
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,240
You will

295
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,960
have your own family

296
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,320
and your own kids.

297
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:45,040
You will find your happiness.

298
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:47,960
But your sister is different.

299
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,680
She is not as lucky as you

300
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:54,040
to have found the love of your life.

301
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:56,520
The car accident

302
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:00,080
has deprived her of the ability to have kids.

303
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,080
She will have

304
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:04,119
a harder life than you.

305
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:07,319
In many aspects,

306
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,079
I can't help Xiaoyu at all.

307
00:17:11,319 --> 00:17:13,680
So, before I pass away,

308
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:17,079
I have to give her a hand

309
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:19,359
so that she can focus on her career

310
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,800
and her life

311
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,599
without having to worry about the future.

312
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,280
In Beijing,

313
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,520
besides the Crossroad Bistro gals,

314
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:30,560
she's got no family

315
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:32,480
other than you.

316
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:33,720
Xue,

317
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:35,920
can you understand

318
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:37,520
my intentions?

319
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:40,760
Our journey has ended.

320
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:43,720
I don't want you to be sad for me.

321
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:47,640
Live your life to the fullest.

322
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:49,640
I will watch over you.

323
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:03,800
Dad.

324
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:07,360
I'm not a good daughter.

325
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:10,280
I am sorry to upset you.

326
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,600
Your grandma

327
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:21,320
loves you deeply.

328
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:44,200
I've gone through so much in the past year.

329
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:54,080
I want to go on a trip and clear my head before New Year.

330
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:56,000
Go.

331
00:19:58,600 --> 00:19:59,960
We'll stay here.

332
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:30,720
Hello, mom.

333
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:33,800
I need to tell you something.

334
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:37,480
Bao Xue's granny

335
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:38,800
passed away.

336
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:43,920
Myocardial infarction.

337
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,720
Maybe you shouldn't come over for Lunar New Year.

338
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,120
It's not a good time

339
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:50,040
for you to meet.

340
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:51,360
Okay.

341
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,280
I will keep her company.

342
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:57,400
We'll go home to see you

343
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,760
in about a week after New Year.

344
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,040
Okay, got it.

345
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,280
Dr. Lu.

346
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:17,400
What do you need?

347
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:18,480
See?

348
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:19,720
You're sharpening your knife again.

349
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:20,800
Sorry.

350
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:21,480
I forgot.

351
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:22,400
I'll stop it.

352

please bless Yu Songyang with a safe return.

Songyang,

I am just too afraid of losing you.

But until today,

536
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:14,719
I still can't accept this decision of yours.

537
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:17,600
I believe most people are like me.

They consider happiness as their lifelong pursuit.

if you want to be happy,

I said that

545

I won't interfere with your decisions.

546
00:34:41,639 --> 00:34:43,679
You want to keep your promise to a friend.

547
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:46,199
I respect this decision

548
00:34:46,199 --> 00:34:48,560
even if I don't agree with it.

549
00:34:51,239 --> 00:34:52,600
I will pray for you.
