It's my treat.

Hello.

It's been a long time since I last saw you.

17
00:02:24,079 --> 00:02:25,400
A long time, indeed.

Where do you work to make a fortune recently?

I'm making money at home.

Where's Yu Songyang?

He's on the way. He will be here very soon.

Hi, Aunt Shan. Hi, two aunts.

27
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,760
Hello.

28
00:02:42,079 --> 00:02:43,280
Sit over here.

29
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,400
Little kids,

30
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:46,920
let me tell you.

31
00:02:47,079 --> 00:02:50,280
This is elder sister Xiaoyu.

32
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,390
I am elder sister Xue.

33
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:52,840
Don't call us aunties in the future.

34
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:53,280
Alright?

35
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,880
Elder sisters, not aunties.

36
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:55,960
Hi, elder sister Xue.

37
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:56,960
Hi, elder sister Xiaoyu.

38
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:57,960
Hi, elder sister Xiaoyu.

39
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,240
Hi, elder sister Xue.

40
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:01,680
Here.

41
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,160
A bottle for each of you

42

These are white peach-flavored Purjoy Yogurt.

44
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:07,480
But remember,

45
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:09,560
these are awards for calling us elder sisters.

46
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:10,880
Do it again.

47
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:12,480
Hi, elder sister Xue.

48
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,480
Thank your elder sister.

49
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,200
Thanks, elder sister.

50
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,800
Poor kids.

51
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,840
It's just for food.

52
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,520
You're making the kids embarrassed.

53
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:22,300
Have you seen any sisters as old as you?

54
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:24,780
Even if I'm eighty, I prefer others address me 
 as elder sister.

55
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:25,320
Sit.

56
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,890
It's nice to be called an elder sister.

57
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:28,840
Right, Xue.

58
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:31,040
Why isn't your boyfriend, the great designer, here?

59

Si Meng,

60
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:34,360
Don't rub it in.

61
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:36,760
I feel distressed whenever someone mentions him.

62
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,079
Don't feel that way.

63
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,280
Come here, Zhuang.

64
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,079
Sit next to me.

65

66
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:47,560
Let me ask you something.

67
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,000
Do you like the yogurt?

68
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:49,880
It's good.

69
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,800
Yeah. I was wrong before.

70
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:17,640
I apologize to you.

71
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,440
I've thought it through.

72
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,560
After I decided to detoxify you, I...

73
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:22,610
Detoxify me?

74
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:23,850
If you already detoxified me,

75
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:24,860
why did you say "after"?

76
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:25,600
I didn't mean that.

77
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,340
I said it wrong.

78
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I said it wrong.

79
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:29,920
What I meant

80
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:31,360
was...

81
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:32,040
I...

82
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,440
For now, I decide to detoxify the dangerous activities,

83
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,159
try to work hard

84
00:04:36,159 --> 00:04:37,520
and keep you company when I have time.

85
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,240
For now?

86
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,480
How long, to be exact?

87
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:43,800
You're the boss.

88
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,800
I didn't force you to do anything.

89
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,159
I offered it.

90
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:51,400
I mean it.

91
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,080
I haven't eaten or slept well these days

92
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,000
and I can't even focus on work

93
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,520
just because I miss you.

94
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,590
I do like extreme sports,

95
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:03,560
but when I think about it, I have to stay alive first.

96
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:05,480
And I can't live well without you.

97
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,040
Xue.

98
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:10,720
That's enough.

99
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,560
Stop it.

100
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:12,680
That's so cheesy.

101
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:13,840
I'm covered with goosebumps.

102
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:14,450
See?

103
00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:15,720
I have more cheesy words to say.

104
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:16,200
Alright.

105
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,240
Stop it, okay?

106
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,320
Do I have your forgiveness?

107
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:24,200
You're such a cunning guy.

108
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:25,840
Are these flowers from yesterday?

109
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:26,840
I swear by my conscience.

110
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:27,640
I bought them just now.

111
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:28,040
It can't be.

112
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,160
They must be from yesterday.

113
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,310
Damn. They're going to argue.

114
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:31,240
What a jerk!

115
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,520
It's just flowers.

116
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:35,990
You took them away and gift them again the next day.

117
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:36,640
Cunning.

118
00:05:37,159 --> 00:05:38,600
I'm not a man if I lie to you.

119
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,640
I really bought new ones.

120
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:41,880
I threw away yesterday's flowers.

121
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,000
Voila, a goof.

122
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,360
The truth slipped out.

123
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,360
I didn't let you get in yesterday

124
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,880
so you just threw away the flowers.

125
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:51,960
You've got some temper, Yu Songyang.

126
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:53,320
Yesterday, it was...

127
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,400
So what?

128
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,720
How could you throw away the flowers?

129
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,720
Give him an out.

130
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,520
Be good. Stop arguing.

131
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:03,800
Zhuang.

132
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,320
What did you say to me in the car?

133
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,800
Tell this uncle again.

134
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:10,040
The most foolish thing is when a couple in love 
 argue with each other.

135
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,720
Where did you learn that from?

136
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,040
Internet.

137
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,720
Kids nowadays are too good.

138
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:15,800
Right?

139
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,160
I can't do anything to your two babies.

140
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:18,880
I mean it.

141
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,240
Here, Yuan.

142
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,120
I gift you a bunch of flowers.

143
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,840
Elder sister Xue,

144
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:27,880
didn't uncle gift the flowers to you?

145
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,800
She knows everything.

146
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,320
Don't ever try to trick us.

147
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:33,440
You're so good.

148
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:35,840
What you did was absolutely correct.

149
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,159
From now on, call him uncle

150
00:06:37,159 --> 00:06:38,159
and call me elder sister.

151
00:06:38,159 --> 00:06:39,080
Okay?

152
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,120
Now try it.

153
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:40,920
Uncle.

154
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,560
Come on. Let's sit down.

155
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:46,680
Let's eat.

156
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,080
The smell is so nice.

157
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:07,840
Of course.

158
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:08,440
Let's go.

159
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:18,680
Everyone.

160
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,680
I'll say something first.

161
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,360
We brought a lot of trouble

162
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:24,200
to you for what happened recently,

163
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:25,880
especially Shanshan.

164
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:27,680
If it wasn't for you,

165
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,000
there would be nothing I can do to clear my name.

166
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,760
We would probably still be in a cold war

167
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:34,400
or even in a worse status.

168
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:36,880
I won't talk too much.

169
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:37,600
Thank you.

170
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,080
Cheers.

171
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:39,800
Cheers.

172
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,360
After this drink,

173
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,760
it's the end of the thing that happened.

174
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,720
Nobody mentions it from now on.

175
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,880
The reunion dinner today is meant for two couples,

176
00:07:57,159 --> 00:07:58,200
Si Meng and Du Shijun

177
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,680
and Xue and Yu Songyang.

178
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,480
I asked the chef

179
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,240
to prepare a special dish for you.

180
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:05,360
Serve it, Feng Xi.

181
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,200
Coming.

182
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,440
It's a new dish proposed by Shanshan

183
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:18,880
and especially created by Henan.

184
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,960
I stewed this using good ingredients

185
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:24,520
like Liaoning sea cucumbers, a soft-shelled turtle 
 and fish maws.

186
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:26,560
The sea cucumber is a homophone for "get."

187
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:29,120
The soft-shelled turtle is a homophone for "going back."

188
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,000
The salmon head broth is a homophone for "together."

189
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,799
Feng Xi named this dish.

190
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:35,360
It's called Getting Back Together.

191
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,000
We wish you love each other dearly.

192
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,559
That's a good message.

193
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,240
Very good.

194
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,559
I want to take a photo with my phone.

195
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:42,600
Getting Back Together.

196
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:44,880
Away with that.

197
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,840
I'm complimenting the name of the dish.

198
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,840
Listen, old couple.

199
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,760
You have gotten back together.

200
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:54,240
Kiss each other now.

201
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:55,280
Come on.

202
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:59,000
Kiss.

203
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,280
You love each other dearly. Kiss.

204
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,080
Alright.

205
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,720
Don't just boo them.

206
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:10,840
It's your turn.

207
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,000
Come on.

208
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,440
Why do you imitate them?

209
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:20,360
It's not creative at all.

210
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,760
How about we run naked?

211
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,560
You are so nasty.

212
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,080
Don't make me worried about you in the future.

213
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,360
Okay?

214
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,120
I promise.

215
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,480
She cries.

216
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:57,000
Poor eyes.

217
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:58,480
Alright.

218
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,440
Stop crying.

219
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,800
Don't make me worried again.

220
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:02,920
Alright.

221
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,120
Keep quiet.

222
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,400
Take a shower and go to bed.

223
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,800
Is Zhuang asleep?

224
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:33,600
Yeah.

225
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:26,120
...those so-called abnormal people

226
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,720
who are not understood by society

227
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,120
and those referred to as crazy people.

228
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:31,920
What's the point of their existence?

229
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,520
In my opinion,

230
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:35,760
the meaning of their existence

231
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:37,080
is to make this world

232
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:39,120
more wonderful.

233
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:39,840
Is that Li?

234
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,000
I will introduce someone

235
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:49,120
you should be familiar with.

236
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:51,040
His name is

237
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:51,920
Yu Songyang.

238
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:00,880
Come on. Take a seat here.

239
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:04,680
Go and play.

240
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:08,960
Feel at home.

241
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:13,960
I'll make you tea.

242
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:15,640
Thanks.

243
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:25,600
Please say thanks to everyone for me,

244
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:26,840
Songyang.

245
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:30,640
With the climbing gym Zhiyuan left us,

246
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:32,200
the kid and I can manage to

247
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,160
make a living.

248
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,240
Does Zanzan know about it?

249
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,200
Yes.

250
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:38,640
I told him right in the beginning.

251
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:40,000
Zhiyuan and I have the same opinion

252
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,480
in educating the child.

253
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:43,240
I will never lie to him

254
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:45,000
no matter what happens in the future.

255
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,280
But he is still so young.

256
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:47,440
Exactly.

257
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,520
Small kids have a limited understanding of the world.

258
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:51,920
He forgets about things in a while.

259
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,250
He asked me a lot in the beginning.

260
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:53,800
Where's dad?

261
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:55,200
Will he never come back?

262
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:56,920
I said,

263
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:58,840
"No, dad will never return."

264
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,320
He was really sad in the beginning.

265
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,600
But he is a kid, after all.

266
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,720
When he plays something else

267
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,880
and gets distracted, he forgets after a while.

268
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,160
Sometimes when I scold him,

269
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,200
he sneaks my phone and sends messages to his dad

270
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:11,480
on WeChat

271
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:13,440
saying something like, "Dad, mom is doing

272
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,400
"this and that to me again."

273
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,240
Songyang.

274
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:22,440
I...

275
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:26,440
want to ask for your help.

276
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:28,720
Zhiyuan must have told you about it.

277
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:30,800
I remember. Don't worry.

278
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:31,640
No problem.

279
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:34,120
Zanzan.

280
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:35,240
Come here.

281
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:37,360
Mom.

282
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,800
Hi, Uncle Songyang. Hi, aunt.

283
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:40,800
Hello.

284
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:41,600
Zanzan.

285
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,120
Come here.

286
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:45,320
From now on, Uncle Songyang is not just your uncle.

287
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,360
What should I call him?

288
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:48,080
Your dad said you should call him godfather.

289
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,320
Go on.

290
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:52,360
Godfather.

291
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:53,880
Louder. Who can hear you?

292
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:54,960
Godfather.

293
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,120
Come here.

294
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,360
Let me hug you.

295
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:00,760
My darling.

296
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,480
How's my boy?

297
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:05,440
He will certainly grow up to be a man much better
  than you.

298
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,480
Of course.

299
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,120
Godfather.

300
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:12,040
Mom said dad won't return forever.

301
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:13,800
Is it true?

302
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:17,280
Yes.

303
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:19,680
But what if I miss him?

304
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:20,880
Then come to me.

305
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:21,520
Okay?

306
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:25,920
Can you play with me?

307
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,120
Of course, I can.

308
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:31,240
Can you teach me how to climb just like dad did?

309
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,400
Of course.

310
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,720
Let's go now.

311
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:35,800
Now?

312
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:37,400
OK.

313
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,640
Let's go.

314
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,480
Be good, Zanzan.

315
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,320
Songyang cares about you a lot.

316
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,680
How do you know?

317
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,880
He looks at you before making a promise.

318
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,240
That means he cares about you.

319
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:56,840
Nothing escapes your eyes, Li.

320
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,440
You have an eye for detail.

321
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:00,200
Do you support him in rock climbing?

322
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,120
Did Yu Songyang tell you something?

323
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:05,160
It's not like that.

324
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:06,720
I was just randomly asking.

325
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:07,440
Because...

326
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,040
You know it, right?

327
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:11,560
Zhiyuan fell right in front of him.

328
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:14,320
So,

329
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:17,320
do you think it's okay if he keeps doing extreme sports?

330
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,600
To tell you the truth,

331
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,400
I...

332
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:25,960
don't really support him.

333
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,520
Maybe I am not strong enough

334
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:29,600
to handle the burden.

335
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:30,440
So,

336
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:31,520
whenever I think about it,

337
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:32,560
I just...

338
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:36,120
If it was me,

339
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:37,800
I wouldn't have your reaction.

340
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,080
Do you mean I'm cold-blooded?

341
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,120
No.

342
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,080
No. I didn't mean that.

343
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:42,600
Li.

344
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:43,230
It's alright.

345
00:15:43,230 --> 00:15:44,880
There's nothing wrong with thinking like that.

346
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,520
You have the most normal way of thinking.

347
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,240
Indeed,

348
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:51,480
this is not easy.

349
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:53,880
On the day of the accident,

350
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:54,780
I was indeed struck

351
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:55,320
the moment

352
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:57,320
I went there.

353
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:58,880
I stood there and couldn't move.

354
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,440
I was just there with my mind completely blank.

355
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:01,240
I didn't have time

356
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:02,240
to cry or to do anything.

357
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:03,440
I was so,

358
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:05,080
so scared.

359
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,960
When did I start to recover a bit?

360
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:09,960
It was when I got back home and started to pack his stuff.

361
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:12,280
When I looked at his equipment,

362
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:14,520
his clothes

363
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:18,200
and the photos of rock climbing on his phone,

364
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:20,280
that was the time

365
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:22,360
I felt

366
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:23,320
that perhaps

367
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:24,960
he is gone.

368
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:28,720
I'm alright.

369
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,000
Indeed,

370
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,160
it was difficult to accept in the beginning.

371
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,240
However,

372
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:37,240
it's not an easy thing anyways.

373
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:42,360
I think you have a relatively good mindset.

374
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:43,200
I feel alright.

375
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,600
Sometimes, I'm good.

376
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:46,160
How did you manage to bounce back?

377
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:50,640
How is it possible to bounce back from something 
 like this?

378
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:52,960
I didn't mean to leave it behind.

379
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:54,200
I just had to leave it behind.

380
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,120
What do you think I can do?

381
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,120
I still have a kid to bring up.

382
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,920
I have to cook on time

383
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:00,360
and send him to school on time.

384
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:02,360
There's no other way.

385
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:04,400
Alright.

386
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,280
No problem.

387
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:07,720
What else can I do when it falls on me?

388
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,240
Do you really not blame him?

389
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,440
He just

390
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:14,440
left, leaving you and the kid.

391
00:17:18,359 --> 00:17:19,400
Well.

392
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:23,240
I can't blame him.

393
00:17:24,839 --> 00:17:25,960
I don't blame him.

394
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,319
It's because

395
00:17:27,319 --> 00:17:28,560
I understand him.

396
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:31,560
I understand what he thinks.

397
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:32,520
In my mind,

398
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:33,880
he is a hero.

399
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:36,520
In the past,

400
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:38,320
We told Zanzan

401
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:39,600
when he was young

402
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,600
that he has to learn

403
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,280
to make decisions for himself.

404
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:43,560
After making the decision,

405
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:45,240
you can't regret it.

406
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:47,120
You have to take responsibility for the decisions

407
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:48,360
you make.

408
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,600
After Zhiyuan's accident, I asked Zanzan,

409
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:51,400
"Do you still

410
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:54,920
want to carry on with rock climbing?

411
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:58,200
If you tell me you don't want to do it anymore,

412
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,160
we will stop it.

413
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,360
I won't force you."

414
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,120
He said,

415
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:03,240
"No.

416
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:05,080
"Mom, I want to do it.

417
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:06,160
"I like it.

418
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,320
"When I grow up,

419
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:13,200
"I will conquer

420
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,400
"the mountains dad hasn't conquered."

421
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,320
That's what he said.

422
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,400
What else can I say?

423
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:22,640
The only thing I can do is to ask Songyang

424
00:18:24,030 --> 00:18:25,800
to check if Zanzan has a talent for it.

425
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:27,560
If he is like his dad, then he can learn

426
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:28,440
and just do it.

427
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:32,840
Yes, step hard.

428
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,920
Come on, be quick.

429
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:56,480
When you were training with Zanzan,

430
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,560
Li told me a lot.

431
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:00,200
What did she say?

432
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:03,200
I won't tell you.

433
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,280
What do you think about Li?

434
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:09,960
Tell me the truth.

435
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:12,200
Do you really hope that I can support you

436
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:14,320
the way she supported Zhiyuan?

437
00:19:15,670 --> 00:19:17,080
This question is a death trap.

438
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,240
Just tell me. I promise I won't be mad.

439
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:23,920
Of course, I hope that we can support

440
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:25,880
each other's hobbies.

441
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:28,600
But we need time to see if things like this can 
 stand the test.

442
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:32,560
So?

443
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:34,200
So,

444
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,480
I think you did pretty well.

445
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,000
When I was training with Zanzan,

446
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
you didn't even stop me.

447
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,280
Don't butter me up.

448
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:43,040
I let you do that because of Zanzan.

449
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:44,960
Don't forget that you're in rehabilitation.

450
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:47,600
But I said I would quit dangerous stuff.

451
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,160
That's not dangerous.

452
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:50,320
You can't forbid me from that.

453
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:50,970
Very well.

454
00:19:50,970 --> 00:19:52,200
You're pushing your luck.

455
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:54,240
You're trying indirect ways to get what you want, right?

456
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:55,920
If you want to climb rocks,

457
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,680
you're only allowed to play with Zanzan.

458
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,080
Alright.

459
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:02,800
I promise you.

460
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:06,760
Where are you going?

461
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:07,800
What do you think?

462
00:20:07,970 --> 00:20:09,410
Did you get a godson just like that?

463
00:20:09,410 --> 00:20:10,990
Don't you need to buy some gifts for him?

464
00:20:10,990 --> 00:20:11,890
Shame on you, godfather.

465
00:20:11,890 --> 00:20:12,720
You're so stingy.

466
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:14,800
How thoughtful.

467
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:18,680
Hi, Ms. Bai.

468
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,120
Let me see.

469
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,000
What are you doing?

470
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,360
Who else sharpens the knife in front of customers?

471
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:27,520
It's just my habit.

472
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:28,240
Alright.

473
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:29,240
I won't sharpen it.

474
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:31,640
She can't tolerate any mistakes.

475
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:33,920
We know each other well.

476
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:34,960
I did it for his good.

477
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:37,600
If it was someone else, I would turn around and walk away.

478
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,120
You're absolutely right, Ms. Bai.

479
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:39,810
Alright.

480
00:20:39,810 --> 00:20:40,880
Which piece would you like?

481
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,200
This piece is tender.

482
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:44,320
Do you want beef or lamb?

483
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:47,760
You said you will teach me how to cook, right?

484
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,360
Let's buy anything easy to make.

485
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,440
Then we will steam a fish.

486
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:52,920
Let's go and buy fish.

487
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:54,040
Come on.

488
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:54,920
Alright. We'll go.

489
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,480
Don't sharpen the knife like that again.

490
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:56,880
Ms. Bai.

491
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:57,680
See you next time.

492
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:58,800
But this piece is really tender.

493
00:20:58,800 --> 00:20:59,280
Look.

494
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,400
You scared her away by sharpening the knife.

495
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,240
But I said I won't do it again.

496
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:04,800
Alright. We will be back next time.

497
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:05,600
Next time.

498
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:06,360
Come on.

499
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:07,280
See you next time.

500
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,080
Leave it here.

501
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:14,040
I'll do it.

502
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:16,680
Don't touch anything.

503
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:17,320
Stand over here.

504
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:19,120
Leave everything to me.

505
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:19,560
OK.

506
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:23,800
Today, you just have to talk and tell me what to do.

507
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:24,640
I'll do everything.

508
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:27,240
Hello, delivery.

509
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:30,920
Coming.

510
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:38,800
Where does it hurt?

511
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:40,000
Come here.

512
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:42,000
Are you alright?

513
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:43,320
- No. 
 - No.

514
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:45,280
Come here.

515
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:46,360
Slow down.

516
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:50,520
I have bandaged you up.

517
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:51,920
Get some good rest when you go home.

518
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:52,440
OK.

519
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:53,280
Hello, president.

520
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:53,840
Thanks, doctor.

521
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:54,450
Hi, Doctor Lv.

522
00:21:54,450 --> 00:21:55,160
Hi, Dong Peng.

523
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,120
You are here as well.

524
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,160
Ms. Bai.

525
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,400
This is Vice President Dong.

526
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:03,120
Thank you for coming here.

527
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,520
Don't worry. Sit, please.

528
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:06,520
I'm Doctor Lv's student.

529
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:07,800
I have to check on you.

530
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:09,400
The doctor says it's a fracture.

531
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:10,520
It's nothing serious.

532
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,800
I will be fine after resting for 10 to 15 days.

533
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:14,680
Indeed, the elderly

534
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:16,120
need to be more careful.

535
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:19,640
You need to eat more food with a good amount of calcium.

536
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:21,280
Women lack calcium more easily.

537
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:22,760
Yeah, sunbathe more.

538
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:24,360
You also need to do a bit of

539
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:26,120
easy exercise at normal times.

540
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:27,080
You're right.

541
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:29,160
I normally don't have enough exercise.

542
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:31,180
Looks like I have to work out more in the future.

543
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:32,560
It's mainly my fault.

544
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:33,920
I didn't take care of her.

545
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:34,920
It's not like that.

546
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,240
Madam,

547
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:37,360
don't do any housework

548
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:38,360
after you go back home.

549
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,360
Is there anyone to take care of you at home?

550
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:40,840
I will.

551
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,320
With Doctor Lv,

552
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:46,440
I won't worry about it anymore.

553
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:48,720
Doctor Lv, look.

554
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:49,980
If the head nurse didn't tell me

555
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:50,730
you're here today,

556
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:51,960
I wouldn't know about it at all.

557
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:53,800
Do tell me next time you're here.

558
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:56,000
Come to me if you need any help.

559
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,840
Go back to work, Dong.

560
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:58,600
It's not urgent.

561
00:22:58,600 --> 00:22:59,320
Alright.

562
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:00,080
Madam.

563
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:01,880
Get some good rest after going back home.

564
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:02,560
Goodbye, Doctor Lv.

565
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:03,180
Bye, madam.

566
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:04,160
Thank you, President Dong.

567
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:04,950
It's my pleasure.

568
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:05,600
Bye.

569
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:07,240
Let's go.

570
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:08,400
Ms. Bai,

571
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,640
I still think we should tell Xiaoyu

572
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:11,440
and Xue.

573
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,000
There you go again.

574
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:14,960
When I say we won't tell them, we won't.

575
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:18,120
It's not an illness that disables me from 
 taking care of myself.

576
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:19,440
Listen to me.

577
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,440
Let's go.

578
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,400
Take away the record, madam.

579
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,160
Thanks.

580
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:24,400
OK.

581
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:26,160
Thank you, Doctor Li.

582
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:26,840
Bye.

583
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,080
Bye.

584
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,280
I'm so full.

585
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:41,800
You lay down the moment you're full.

586
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:48,640
Let's have some desserts.

587
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:52,000
There were desserts, and you didn't eat.

588
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,960
I just like desserts made by Cheese.

589
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:57,760
Yu Songyang.

590
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,800
We're still fixing our relationship.

591
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:01,720
You'd better behave well.

592
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:03,720
Otherwise, I will flick you any moment.

593
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:06,840
Flick, flick, flick.

594
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:07,840
I'll do as you command.

595
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:21,760
Hi, granny.

596
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,260
Have you received the strawberries

597
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:24,000
I sent you?

598
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,440
Are they sweet?

599
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,520
Granny, here's the thing.

600
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:31,720
I have something to do recently.

601
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,600
I haven't finished it.

602
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:36,360
So I probably won't have time to visit you.

603
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:37,920
Be good

604
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:41,200
and stay together with Doctor Lv.

605
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:43,880
Alright.

606
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:44,480
That's it, then.

607
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:45,480
Bye-bye.

608
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,600
Why are you smiling?

609
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:51,960
You worry about her so much.

610
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:58,080
These strawberries are sent by my granddaughter.

611
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:00,240
She keeps asking if I ate them.

612
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:01,560
Did you tell her

613
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:03,160
that you fell hard

614
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:05,000
just because of these strawberries?

615
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:06,880
Why would I tell her?

616
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,320
She can't bear the pain for me.

617
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:09,840
If she comes back,

618
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,320
she will make a fuss.

619
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:15,080
But I want to bear the pain for you.

620
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:17,320
Listen,

621
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:18,600
these days,

622
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,560
you need to come here and cook for me.

623
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,840
I'm not used to eating in restaurants.

624
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:24,960
Alright.

625
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:27,760
As long as you want to teach me, I will be here and learn.

626
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,840
The fish is ready.

627
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:31,960
I'll go.

628
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:33,960
Slow down.

629
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,920
Don't hurt yourself too.

630
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:37,560
It's okay.

631
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:45,560
Did you burn yourself?

632
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,120
You're so clumsy.

633
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:52,480
Did you burn yourself?

634
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:53,360
I'm alright.

635
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:54,560
You burnt yourself.

636
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:56,080
The more I want to show you,

637
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:57,960
the worse I perform.

638
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:00,920
Put it down.

639
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:06,600
Add the seasoned soy sauce for seafood.

640
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:07,680
Alright.

641
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:11,760
Good.

642
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,800
Put the shredded chives

643
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:16,280
on the fish.

644
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:20,280
Be quick.

645
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:21,440
The oil will catch fire.

646
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,640
Turn off the fire.

647
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:30,320
You can't multitask at all.

648
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:32,080
It's my first attempt, after all.

649
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:33,160
Splash the oil.

650
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:38,480
All of it?

651
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:39,280
All of it.

652
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:41,920
OK.

653
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:42,600
That's enough.

654
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,120
The dinner is accomplished.

655
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:51,440
We can start eating.

656
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:52,160
Where's the rice?

657
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:59,800
I forgot to turn the rice cooker on.

658
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:06,880
May I speak to the person in charge?

659
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:10,240
Who are you?

660
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:12,360
We're from the Administration for Market Regulation.

661
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:14,880
Just a moment.

662
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,140
I will inform the manager for you.

663
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:16,640
OK.

664
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:23,760
Feng Xi.

665
00:27:24,130 --> 00:27:26,080
Don't forget the fire safety incident last time.

666
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:26,800
Mind your attitude.

667
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:27,520
I know.

668
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:32,160
Hello.

669
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:32,600
Hello.

670
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:33,880
I'm the manager here.

671
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:35,560
Get them two cups of water, Ding.

672
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:36,440
OK.

673
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:38,280
Sit, please.

674
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:40,120
We're here because we received a report

675
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:42,120
that you have food safety problems.

676
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:42,800
Report?

677
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:44,280
Who reported it?

678
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:45,440
I'm afraid we can't tell you that.

679
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:47,040
Here's the material.

680
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:48,160
Please cooperate.

681
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:48,960
I'm listening.

682
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:49,920
What can we do to cooperate?

683
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:51,440
You have a dish called

684
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:53,120
Jerkies and Prawn Cake Sandwich.

685
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:53,520
Right?

686
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:54,000
Yes.

687
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:55,840
Can you make one for me?

688
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,440
We need to get into the kitchen.

689
00:27:58,920 --> 00:27:59,920
The jerkies we use are

690
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:01,840
from Macao and shipped by air.

691
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:03,880
The prawn cakes are made from fresh prawns.

692
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:16,360
Put is down now.

693
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:21,600
What's wrong?

694
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:22,600
Give me the knife.

695
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:28,400
You need to separate knives for raw 
 and cooked food, right?

696
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:29,200
Yes.

697
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:31,760
There're jerkies and prawn cakes in this sandwich.

698
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:33,720
I also see lettuce and tomatoes, right?

699
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:34,360
Yes.

700
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:35,080
Let me ask you.

701
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:38,320
Is this knife for raw or cooked food?

702
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:43,360
Don't you separate raw and cooked food?

703
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:48,000
But five-star hotels also

704
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,600
cut their sandwiches in half from the middle.

705
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,370
Are their knives for raw or cooked food?

706
00:28:51,370 --> 00:28:53,200
Even five-star hotels need to suspend business

707
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:55,400
for rectification if they can't meet 
 hygiene standards.

708
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:56,400
You are right.

709
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:57,760
What do you think we need to do?

710
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:58,480
We will cooperate.

711
00:28:58,560 --> 00:28:59,200
Let's talk outside.

712
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:00,360
OK.

713
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:22,760
If I wasn't at home during the weekend,

714
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:23,920
where else can I be?

715
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:27,920
Why have we been suspended again?

716
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:29,520
What happened?

717
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:33,120
Come on.

718
00:29:34,010 --> 00:29:35,800
Let's take this dish off the menu first.

719
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:37,280
Don't get suspended because of this.

720
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:38,400
Right.

721
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:41,080
I invited people to have dinner there.

722
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:45,440
We're not opening. Can't we just serve ourselves?

723
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:47,560
Prepare the food.

724
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:54,480
It's so troublesome.

725
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:00,760
It's just an inspection.

726
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:01,920
Why are you so worried?

727
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:03,840
Take my place if you can manage.

728
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:04,840
I can't.

729
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:06,760
I have never written a self-criticism since young.

730
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:08,040
You have the experience, at least.

731
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:10,920
But last time, I wrote it for you.

732
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:12,720
Still, you did it before.

733
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,280
You must be more experienced than me.

734
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:20,440
Come on.

735
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,040
I'll give you an example.

736
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:24,680
Distinguished leaders,

737
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:30,760
We know the seriousness of our mistakes.

738
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:34,960
Before coming up with a solution,

739
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,560
we will take this dish off the menu.

740
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:38,040
In the future, we promise

741
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:40,960
there will never be similar problems again.

742
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:42,200
We also promise

743
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:44,560
that we won't make the same mistake again.

744
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:46,960
Sign it.

745
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:48,480
Best regards.

746
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:51,440
Is that all?

747
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:53,720
It's like primary school students making sentences.

748
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:55,920
That's the same idea.

749
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:57,360
Improvise a bit.

750
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:59,160
If you can't do it, ask Henan for help.

751
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:03,280
Where's Henan?

752
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:05,240
He said he'll go out and think about a solution.

753
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:08,120
If he can't do it inside the restaurant,

754
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:09,640
why does he think he can do it outside?

755
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:11,920
We can't always be suspended.

756
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:12,560
I mean it.

757
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:14,480
Let's just take it off the menu.

758
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:16,080
You're not working in the restaurant.

759
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:17,160
You don't know the situation.

760
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:19,280
Do you have any idea how many of these

761
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:20,800
sandwiches we sell each day

762
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:22,120
for dine-in and takeaway?

763
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:23,240
How many?

764
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:24,800
At least 50.

765
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:26,840
Our record is 102 orders in a day.

766
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:28,480
The price is 38 RMB each.

767
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:29,880
With this sandwich only,

768
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:31,680
we can receive a few thousand RMB each day.

769
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:33,640
Don't tell me to take it off.

770
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:35,960
We can't do that, then.

771
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:37,960
How about this?

772
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:40,760
We serve it as a whole.

773
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:42,240
Let's see which is the biggest.

774
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:45,200
Stop being annoying.

775
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,040
Let him think about it first.

776
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:47,840
He can think about it.

777
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:48,920
But you need to write it, too.

778
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:50,200
Hand it in tomorrow.

779
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:51,160
Pay the fine, too.

780
00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:53,000
We have to reopen tomorrow. Understood?

781
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,040
Alright. Stop nagging.

782
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:56,600
Me, nagging?

783
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:58,000
Who called me in the morning,

784
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:58,680
whimpering

785
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:00,600
and said, "We're suspended again"?

786
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,920
Tell me, have we crossed someone?

787
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,120
You're so annoying.

788
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:14,560
I just thought about something.

789
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:29,160
Hi, Mr. Lu.

790
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:30,640
Shanshan.

791
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:31,880
Why are you alone?

792
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:33,200
I arrived here first.

793
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,400
My friends are on the way.

794
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:35,920
Let's have an agreement.

795
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:37,640
It's my treat today. Don't you ask for the bill!

796
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:38,360
I can't agree.

797
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:41,480
I come here for dinner to support you.

798
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:42,760
I can't let you pay for dinner.

799
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,080
To be honest,

800
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:45,520
something went wrong in my restaurant.

801
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:46,560
We're suspended from rectifying.

802
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:48,240
If you pay, it counts as I'm opening for business.

803
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:49,800
That would be my mistake.

804
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:50,720
Next time.

805
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:51,560
Next time.

806
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:52,720
Alright.

807
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,280
If you insist.

808
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:55,130
Sit here.

809
00:32:55,130 --> 00:32:56,280
I'll arrange the dishes for you.

810
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:57,000
Alright.

811
00:32:57,400 --> 00:33:00,720
[Crossroad Bistro]

812
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:16,240
What do you think this knife is for, raw or cooked?

813
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:19,800
A disposable knife.

814
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:23,480
Why are you so clever?

815
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:29,320
Not bad.

816
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:30,600
Very deep.

817
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:32,560
Also, you have literary talent.

818
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:34,200
I'm not as talented as you.

819
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:35,400
I'm not talented at all.

820
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:36,400
These are

821
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:38,680
just lousy ideas.

822
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:44,840
Why do I feel

823
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:46,560
this sandwich is so tasty today?

824
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:49,960
You have solved two difficult problems for me.

825
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:50,840
What can I do to thank you?

826
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:55,000
Don't thank me.

827
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:56,320
How about

828
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:58,360
you help me out?

829
00:33:58,760 --> 00:33:59,400
Tell me.

830
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:03,480
My parents

831
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:04,960
always urge me to find a girlfriend.

832
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:07,280
You know what my mom is like.

833
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:09,600
Once in a while, she asks others to introduce girls to me.

834
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:11,000
She also insists that I should meet them.

835
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,010
To meet some of them, I even had to go back to my hometown.

836
00:34:13,010 --> 00:34:15,400
I just paid lip service and said I already 
 have a girlfriend.

837
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:16,840
Then?

838
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:18,520
Autumn is coming.

839
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:20,320
They said when the weather cools down,

840
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:21,679
they will come to Beijing and visit me.

841
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:23,560
If I find a girlfriend

842
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:25,000
before they come and visit,

843
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:25,980
don't worry about it.

844
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:28,880
If I didn't, can I ask you to...

845
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:35,000
To what?

846
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:45,480
Can I ask you to tell Sun

847
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:46,320
and persuade her?

848
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:48,080
Ask her to pretend to be my girlfriend.

849
00:34:50,199 --> 00:34:51,760
Do you want to piss your mom off to death

850
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:54,280
or do you want to be beaten to death by Sun's husband?

851
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:05,400
Hello.

852
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:06,200
Hello.

853
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:07,000
Two guests?

854
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:07,480
Yes.

855
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:08,920
Girl,

856
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:10,960
you're Feng Xi, right?

857
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:11,680
Yes.

858
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:12,560
Who are you?

859
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:14,400
We're Zhao Henan's parents.

860
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:16,320
Hello, uncle and aunt.

861
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:17,120
Come in, please.

862
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:18,360
Your parents are here.

863
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:19,200
My parents?

864
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:20,840
Don't forget what I told you.

865
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,160
I won't.

866
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:24,640
Why do you do this surprise attack?

867
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:25,880
At first sight,

868
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:27,440
Feng Xi looks very joyous.

869
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:29,320
She is always smiling.

870
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:30,600
I like her.

871
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:31,840
Nan.

872
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:32,920
Look,

873
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:34,720
it's hard work running this restaurant.

874
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:36,000
These days,

875
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,400
your dad and I will go to your place.

876
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:39,320
Your dad can cook some signature dishes

877
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:40,680
and help the two of you relax.
