00:01:02,899 --> 00:01:03,983
Dad!

6
00:01:04,401 --> 00:01:06,152
Motherfucker...

7
00:01:09,489 --> 00:01:11,925
- Fucking bastard!
- What? What is it?

8
00:01:11,991 --> 00:01:13,385
You call that driving, asshole?

9
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:16,429
Yeah, I drive like this,
you fucking bitch!

10
00:01:16,496 --> 00:01:17,806
What did you say?

11
00:01:17,872 --> 00:01:21,935
Sir, you got a kid, go on
your way, fucking hobo!

12
00:01:22,001 --> 00:01:24,713
- I'm a hobo now?
- What are you gonna do?

13
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:28,359
- Do something! Go on!
- Get out of there!

14
00:01:28,425 --> 00:01:30,944
- You got worked up, fucker!
- Come on out!

15
00:01:31,010 --> 00:01:33,614
Do something, dipshit!

16
00:01:33,679 --> 00:01:35,598
You picked on the wrong guy.

17
00:01:40,645 --> 00:01:43,481
Dad! Don't do it, please don't!

18
00:01:44,607 --> 00:01:46,025
Dad, let's just go!

19
00:01:46,359 --> 00:01:47,359
Dad!

20
00:01:48,194 --> 00:01:51,006
- Dad! Please!
- You son of a bitch!

21
00:01:51,072 --> 00:01:52,383
Dad, please stop!

22
00:01:52,449 --> 00:01:53,676
Come at me, fucker!

23
00:01:53,742 --> 00:01:55,160
Hit me, come on!

24
00:02:05,044 --> 00:02:06,379
Oh my...

25
00:02:08,882 --> 00:02:11,926
Oh... Oh god!

26
00:02:13,052 --> 00:02:15,597
A girl is pinned down!

27
00:02:16,264 --> 00:02:19,642
Someone do something!

28
00:02:20,267 --> 00:02:22,520
Call 911! Now!

29
00:02:28,693 --> 00:02:31,296
- Where is the blood coming from?
- Right here.

30
00:02:31,362 --> 00:02:33,090
- We need tape.
- Tape! Tape!

31
00:02:33,156 --> 00:02:34,824
More. Yes, give it here.

32
00:02:35,366 --> 00:02:36,743
Here it is.

33
00:02:40,413 --> 00:02:41,664
Give me some more.

34
00:02:47,545 --> 00:02:48,545
Run!

35
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:49,964
Run!

36
00:02:55,386 --> 00:02:56,554
That's it!

37
00:03:15,114 --> 00:03:16,574
Out of the way!

38
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:20,035
Get off, get off!

39
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,473
Daddy must be home.

40
00:03:41,391 --> 00:03:42,725
He's here.

41
00:03:43,434 --> 00:03:44,769
Where's Ji-su?

42
00:03:44,936 --> 00:03:47,748
She's in the workout room,
what'd you like for dinner?

43
00:03:47,814 --> 00:03:50,358
Could you make me some ramyun, please?

44
00:03:51,317 --> 00:03:52,402
Of course.

45
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:09,085
Welcome home, did you have dinner?

46
00:04:09,544 --> 00:04:10,795
I'm gonna have some ramyun.

47
00:04:11,212 --> 00:04:12,881
Always ramyun.

48
00:04:13,381 --> 00:04:16,318
Our maid specializes in
traditional Korean food.

49
00:04:16,384 --> 00:04:17,802
She's very good.

50
00:04:18,177 --> 00:04:20,614
You're the one who should
eat, and stop working out.

51
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:22,473
I need to lose 4kg more.

52
00:04:22,974 --> 00:04:24,684
You're already so pretty.

53
00:04:25,351 --> 00:04:27,270
Because I work out.

54
00:04:38,281 --> 00:04:40,742
Hye-yoon, going somewhere?

55
00:04:42,201 --> 00:04:44,996
To uncle's, Si-ho needs
some help with math.

56
00:04:45,413 --> 00:04:46,414
I see.

57
00:04:47,248 --> 00:04:48,725
I told stepmom about it.

58
00:04:48,791 --> 00:04:50,376
Could you stop saying 'step'?

59
00:04:50,627 --> 00:04:51,711
Why?

60
00:04:55,298 --> 00:04:56,817
If it gets late, I'll call ahead.

61
00:04:56,883 --> 00:04:58,051
Sweetie.

62
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:00,345
Got any spending money?

63
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:01,721
Thank you.

64
00:05:02,096 --> 00:05:05,617
You should be, there's
no ATM like your dad.

65
00:05:05,683 --> 00:05:08,269
I readily volunteer. So, how much?

66
00:05:10,563 --> 00:05:12,440
I'll put it on your desk.

67
00:05:14,108 --> 00:05:19,864
<i>A road rager who killed another
driver was apprehended by the police.</i>

68
00:05:20,031 --> 00:05:24,136
<i>They will investigate this incident
as a retaliatory auto assault.</i>

69
00:05:24,202 --> 00:05:26,079

<i>A moment later, an SUV stops in front.</i>

<i>YTN, Kim So-jin.</i>

80
00:05:56,359 --> 00:05:58,486
Osung Group's third son?

81
00:06:00,947 --> 00:06:03,992
Do I have to do this?

82
00:06:11,249 --> 00:06:12,500
How much?

83
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:17,213
Hello.

84
00:06:19,382 --> 00:06:20,383
How is she?

85
00:06:21,551 --> 00:06:24,512
Dr. Yang, I was told
the surgery went well,

86
00:06:24,929 --> 00:06:27,140
but why isn't she speaking yet?

87
00:06:27,849 --> 00:06:29,726
It's likely from the shock.

88
00:06:30,685 --> 00:06:32,395
There was no damage to her brain.

89
00:06:32,687 --> 00:06:34,981
Doctor, will she ever walk again?

90
00:06:35,815 --> 00:06:38,860
She'll walk, run, go to school,
and everything in between.

91
00:06:38,985 --> 00:06:41,988
Her dad was a baseball player.

92
00:06:42,655 --> 00:06:44,466
The driver thought he was a thug,

93
00:06:44,532 --> 00:06:48,161
because he had a bat in the
car, and a tattoo on his arm.

94
00:06:48,453 --> 00:06:54,042
But it's this one, it's got our
daughter's name and footprints.

95
00:06:54,208 --> 00:06:56,753
I got the same one too!

96
00:07:05,053 --> 00:07:08,514
I wasn't gonna cry in the hospital...

97
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:21,402
There's a chapel in the lobby,
you can cry freely there.

98
00:07:24,155 --> 00:07:25,656
Thank you...

99
00:07:28,493 --> 00:07:30,178
She's the one from the news, right?

100
00:07:30,244 --> 00:07:31,245
Yes.

101
00:07:31,496 --> 00:07:32,914
It's a pity.

102
00:07:33,331 --> 00:07:37,001
She'll need follow up surgery.
Check her condition and get a date.

103
00:07:37,251 --> 00:07:39,253
That might be tough.

104
00:07:40,505 --> 00:07:41,547
Why?

105
00:07:42,298 --> 00:07:44,884
Admin said they haven't
paid the bill yet.

106
00:07:45,718 --> 00:07:48,054
So heartless...

107
00:07:48,721 --> 00:07:51,390
Still set a date, saving
a life is the priority.

108
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:55,019
What if you get scolded
again like last time?

109
00:07:55,603 --> 00:07:57,396
I'll say that you did it.

110
00:08:00,274 --> 00:08:03,569
<i>Fuck it! Let's go!</i>

111
00:08:04,529 --> 00:08:08,574
<i>Bam! We gotta take down
that asshole on the road!</i>

112
00:08:09,367 --> 00:08:11,178
Here comes the bat.

113
00:08:11,244 --> 00:08:12,304
- He has to.
- Hit him.

114
00:08:12,370 --> 00:08:13,221
- Hit him.
- Do it.

115
00:08:13,287 --> 00:08:14,139
- Hurry!
- Go!

116
00:08:14,205 --> 00:08:14,640
Hit him!

117
00:08:14,706 --> 00:08:16,266
<i>Fucking crush him!</i>

118
00:08:16,332 --> 00:08:19,210
<i>Those asshole drivers gotta be slammed!</i>

119
00:08:19,961 --> 00:08:20,896
Is he dead for real?

120
00:08:20,962 --> 00:08:24,274
<i>Guys, I used all my creds
to bring you this footage.</i>

121
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:27,969
<i>Make sure you like and subscribe...</i>

122
00:08:43,109 --> 00:08:44,276
Wanna vape?

123
00:09:15,223 --> 00:09:16,267
I got it.

124
00:09:21,814 --> 00:09:23,816
- I'm home.
- Welcome.

125
00:09:24,483 --> 00:09:27,111
Is Jae-wan back? My son Jae-wan.

126
00:09:27,319 --> 00:09:29,739
It's Jae-gyu, your doctor son.

127
00:09:30,031 --> 00:09:33,409
Tell Jae-wan to come home.
He needs his dinner.

128
00:09:33,743 --> 00:09:37,079
Why do you keep asking for
that useless lawyer son?

129
00:09:37,413 --> 00:09:39,999
He had a baby at his age,
and is busy singing lullabies.

130
00:09:42,376 --> 00:09:43,376
I'm gonna go.

131
00:09:46,047 --> 00:09:48,108
I need to fix Jae-wan dinner.

132
00:09:48,174 --> 00:09:51,177
Mother, this is your home.

133
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:52,428
You crazy bitch!

134
00:09:52,803 --> 00:09:54,448
How dare you try to
starve Jae-wan to death!

135
00:09:54,472 --> 00:09:55,932
She's keeping me locked up.

136
00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:57,659
- Mother!
- Mom...

137
00:09:57,725 --> 00:10:00,102
Don't touch me, you goddamn shrew!

138
00:10:02,521 --> 00:10:03,521
Mom!

139
00:10:04,690 --> 00:10:06,234
What's with you?

140
00:10:18,579 --> 00:10:20,622
Please lie down, ma'am.

141
00:10:24,919 --> 00:10:27,771
Mother is so full of energy.

142
00:10:27,838 --> 00:10:30,550
Ma'am, you're so strong.

143
00:10:52,113 --> 00:10:53,281
Are you okay?

144
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:54,824
Yeah.

145
00:10:56,993 --> 00:10:58,786
I'm used to it by now.

146
00:10:59,495 --> 00:11:03,541
Tell your brother to leave
all her inheritance to me.

147
00:11:05,626 --> 00:11:08,795
Yeah, okay...

148
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:11,173
Come on.

149
00:11:14,302 --> 00:11:16,154
Hye-yoon's stepmom called.

150
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:17,220
Why?

151
00:11:17,596 --> 00:11:19,598
For dinner, of course.

152
00:11:20,598 --> 00:11:23,411
She wanted to fix a date so
Jae-wan could reserve a table.

153
00:11:23,477 --> 00:11:27,249
Is he starting a gourmet club?

154
00:11:27,315 --> 00:11:29,209
Will she bring her rice cakes again?

155
00:11:29,275 --> 00:11:32,153
It was good, bean
paste flower, wasn't it?

156
00:11:36,032 --> 00:11:39,827
Rice cakes are just rice
cakes, trying to sound all fancy.

157
00:11:40,953 --> 00:11:43,080
She's got a ton of licenses too.

158
00:11:43,664 --> 00:11:48,186
Nail art, pilates, yoga, floristry,
she does everything.

159
00:11:48,252 --> 00:11:54,550
She hit the jackpot, getting noticed
while delivering rice cakes to a law firm.

160
00:11:57,261 --> 00:11:59,847
He sure is consistent.

161
00:12:00,473 --> 00:12:02,993
He loved rice cakes since he was a kid.

162
00:12:03,059 --> 00:12:05,436
Battering the rice cake girl now.

163
00:12:20,034 --> 00:12:21,327
Hi, Hye-yoon.

164
00:12:21,786 --> 00:12:22,971
I'll be off.

165
00:12:23,037 --> 00:12:25,206
Hye-yoon, thank you for your help.

166
00:12:26,791 --> 00:12:30,061
Honey, she came to tutor Si-ho.

167
00:12:30,127 --> 00:12:32,630
Thank you, Hye-yoon.

168
00:12:32,838 --> 00:12:34,357
He's studying hard?

169
00:12:34,423 --> 00:12:36,717
Yes, he's doing his homework.

170
00:12:38,302 --> 00:12:41,448
Don't just stand there,
give her some allowance.

171
00:12:41,514 --> 00:12:43,140
Yes, of course.

172
00:12:43,516 --> 00:12:44,892
Thank you.

173
00:12:48,521 --> 00:12:50,815
I got no cash, you got any?

174
00:12:50,898 --> 00:12:53,150
This is so embarrassing.

175
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:56,694
Wait, I might have some in my room.

176
00:13:00,449 --> 00:13:01,992
I'm just gonna go.

177
00:13:05,162 --> 00:13:07,456
No need to say good bye to grandma.

178
00:13:08,749 --> 00:13:10,876
She must be a handful, aunty.

179
00:13:14,295 --> 00:13:16,715
Hye-yoon, I almost forgot.

180
00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:34,442
Dope.

181
00:13:39,155 --> 00:13:40,156
Here.

182
00:13:46,662 --> 00:13:47,972
Thank you, aunty.

183
00:13:48,038 --> 00:13:51,559
That's not free,
consider it an advance.

184
00:13:51,625 --> 00:13:54,712
Let's volunteer together
when you go to college.

185
00:13:55,963 --> 00:13:56,964
Sure.

186
00:14:00,425 --> 00:14:02,553
Uncle is really taking his time.

187
00:14:07,683 --> 00:14:10,269
Judging from the incident report,

188
00:14:10,978 --> 00:14:15,458
the deceased intimidated you first
while wielding a weapon, right?

189
00:14:15,524 --> 00:14:16,210
That's right.

190
00:14:16,276 --> 00:14:18,627
You felt threatened for your life,

191
00:14:18,694 --> 00:14:22,990
and due to extreme fear, you
only wanted to get out of there.

192
00:14:23,616 --> 00:14:24,617
Yes.

193
00:14:25,367 --> 00:14:27,512
I never thought he'd
attack so suddenly.

194
00:14:27,578 --> 00:14:28,871
That's just it.

195
00:14:30,915 --> 00:14:33,726
You weren't trying to fight,
but made a mistake

196
00:14:33,792 --> 00:14:35,753
while fleeing, that's the fact.

197
00:14:36,212 --> 00:14:39,340
You swore because you were panicking.

198
00:14:41,175 --> 00:14:47,806
In the security cam footage,
you reversed first.

199
00:14:51,644 --> 00:14:55,523
You were securing space
to swerve around him.

200
00:14:59,735 --> 00:15:00,736
Yes.

201
00:15:01,487 --> 00:15:06,992
Your memory may feel fuzzy, but
your testimony must be consistent.

202
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:11,288
Yes, attorney Yang.

203
00:15:13,415 --> 00:15:16,377
We're continuing to work with
the victim's family to settle.

204
00:15:16,544 --> 00:15:18,128
They won't last long.

205
00:15:19,630 --> 00:15:21,423
What if they don't settle?

206
00:15:24,134 --> 00:15:27,846
Everyone gets weak
before their children.

207
00:15:59,086 --> 00:16:00,855
Yo! You love to suck, huh?

208
00:16:00,921 --> 00:16:02,298
Suck, suck, suck!

209
00:16:02,673 --> 00:16:03,424
You sick fuck.

210
00:16:03,674 --> 00:16:05,175
So disgusting!

211
00:16:05,801 --> 00:16:06,362
You okay?

212
00:16:06,428 --> 00:16:08,154
- Sorry, man.
- Let me see.

213
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:10,055
I'm sorry, moron.

214
00:16:11,765 --> 00:16:12,808
What are you doing?

215
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:14,768
What the hell.

216
00:16:17,730 --> 00:16:18,665
What the...

217
00:16:18,731 --> 00:16:19,898
Let's go.

218
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,241
Delete that.

219
00:16:29,575 --> 00:16:30,743
Fine.

220
00:16:31,035 --> 00:16:33,454
Why let them step all over you?

221
00:16:34,830 --> 00:16:35,830
What is it again?

222
00:16:38,292 --> 00:16:40,836
You know that adults are
having dinner tonight?

223
00:16:41,712 --> 00:16:42,713
Yeah.

224
00:16:44,256 --> 00:16:46,300
Let's get some fresh air.

225
00:16:48,927 --> 00:16:51,972
You'll be hungry after classes at 11.

226
00:16:53,390 --> 00:16:55,976
Don't eat junk food from
convenience stores.

227
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:59,706
The maid will fix you something
when you get home.

228
00:16:59,772 --> 00:17:00,773
<i>Okay.</i>

229
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,859
Don't watch too much YouTube.

230
00:17:06,111 --> 00:17:07,446
Si-ho?

231
00:17:08,072 --> 00:17:09,365
Are you listening?

232
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,658
Can you hear me?

233
00:17:13,744 --> 00:17:14,870
Is it Si-ho?

234
00:17:17,956 --> 00:17:19,583
Can you go alone?

235
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:24,171
Mother got rowdy earlier,
and scolded the maid too.

236
00:17:27,716 --> 00:17:29,968
You got all dolled up
and you'll just go home?

237
00:17:30,594 --> 00:17:32,930
You put in so much effort today.

238
00:17:34,764 --> 00:17:36,200
Not as much as Mrs. Yang.

239
00:17:36,266 --> 00:17:38,310
Could you stop with 'Mrs. Yang'?

240
00:17:38,769 --> 00:17:40,062
It'll become a habit.

241
00:17:40,396 --> 00:17:42,916
I don't have the will to
call her by her name.

242
00:17:42,982 --> 00:17:44,441
I can't be too friendly with her.

243
00:17:46,068 --> 00:17:48,421
You're not getting insecure
over it, are you?

244
00:17:48,487 --> 00:17:49,696
Are you nuts?

245
00:17:50,114 --> 00:17:53,826
How is she better than
me? Besides her youth?

246
00:17:54,576 --> 00:17:56,578
- That's it.
- What is?

247
00:17:56,995 --> 00:17:58,247
Her youth.

248
00:17:58,789 --> 00:18:00,456
Youth is everything.

249
00:18:01,583 --> 00:18:05,212
Do you feel wronged that
you married an older woman?

250
00:18:09,633 --> 00:18:11,635
I'll admit what I have to.

251
00:18:12,011 --> 00:18:14,221
Come on, I'm just kidding.

252
00:18:17,014 --> 00:18:21,020
You really are stunning tonight.

253
00:18:29,485 --> 00:18:30,612
For real.

254
00:18:46,253 --> 00:18:47,254
Get in.

255
00:18:56,054 --> 00:18:57,306
Hello to you too.

256
00:19:07,941 --> 00:19:10,860
You know Jaiden, the UCLA dude.

257
00:19:30,923 --> 00:19:33,109
Could you...

258
00:19:33,175 --> 00:19:34,468
One moment...

259
00:19:38,764 --> 00:19:40,014
Good evening!

260
00:19:40,516 --> 00:19:41,850
Money is everything.

261
00:19:43,936 --> 00:19:46,897
Feel wronged? Admit what you have to.

262
00:19:49,023 --> 00:19:50,126
You're here!

263
00:19:50,192 --> 00:19:51,693
Evening, Yeon-kyung.

264
00:19:52,319 --> 00:19:54,404
We should've arrived earlier.

265
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:55,989
Have you been well?

266
00:19:58,992 --> 00:20:00,511
You're so beautiful today.

267
00:20:00,577 --> 00:20:04,474
Who'd take you for a new mom?

268
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:07,584
Stop saying things you don't
mean and let's go inside.

269
00:20:48,083 --> 00:20:53,213
Back in 1755, during Louis XV's rule,

270
00:20:53,504 --> 00:20:56,818
Richelieu of Bordeaux
returned to Paris,

271
00:20:56,884 --> 00:20:59,946
and the king asked him his
secret to keeping his youth,

272
00:21:00,012 --> 00:21:02,990
and Richelieu said he found
the fountain of youth,

273
00:21:03,056 --> 00:21:05,475
and gifted this wine to the king.

274
00:21:05,893 --> 00:21:07,686
- Drink as you like.
- Wow.

275
00:21:09,187 --> 00:21:10,856
Then I should drink plenty.

276
00:21:11,857 --> 00:21:13,459
Please drink as much as you like.

277
00:21:13,525 --> 00:21:15,485
We brought two bottles.

278
00:21:19,406 --> 00:21:23,201
I could be paged at any moment.
So, tell us why we're here.

279
00:21:24,453 --> 00:21:25,787
It's about mom.

280
00:21:27,372 --> 00:21:29,975
I looked into a nursing
home that's quite good.

281
00:21:30,042 --> 00:21:31,227
A nursing home?

282
00:21:31,293 --> 00:21:33,937
Jae-gyu, it's a nursing
home in name only.

283
00:21:34,004 --> 00:21:36,089
It's more like a luxury resort.

284
00:21:36,924 --> 00:21:38,025
A resort?

285
00:21:38,091 --> 00:21:43,196
There are specialists and nurses
on site working around the clock.

286
00:21:43,263 --> 00:21:47,368
They'll do laundry, clean and provide
meals and topnotch service too.

287
00:21:47,434 --> 00:21:49,370
The exercise facilities are incredible.

288
00:21:49,436 --> 00:21:51,437
You two should live there then.

289
00:21:53,732 --> 00:21:57,194
Jae-gyu, don't just look
at it so pessimistically.

290
00:21:57,444 --> 00:22:02,908
The staff takes care of residents
better than their own children do.

291
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,635
You're so selfish.

292
00:22:04,701 --> 00:22:06,637
Si-ho will be prepping
for college soon.

293
00:22:06,703 --> 00:22:09,373
He'll need her full attention.

294
00:22:09,748 --> 00:22:11,850
Yeon-kyung can't let out a peep.

295
00:22:11,917 --> 00:22:13,126
Am I right?

296
00:22:17,547 --> 00:22:20,634
College prep is indeed a full time job.

297
00:22:22,427 --> 00:22:26,098
You and I are terrible brothers.

298
00:22:27,391 --> 00:22:30,936
I wanted to bring mom home
after Hye-yoon goes to college,

299
00:22:32,104 --> 00:22:33,855
but I got a baby now.

300
00:22:34,481 --> 00:22:39,945
Come on, a baby at
your age is like a trophy.

301
00:22:44,658 --> 00:22:49,204
They require $200,000
deposit, and $6,000 monthly,

302
00:22:50,038 --> 00:22:50,891
so just cover $1,000 a month.

303
00:22:50,956 --> 00:22:53,250
Seriously? Money is not the issue!

304
00:22:53,625 --> 00:22:57,045
You're outside all day,
but think about her.

305
00:22:57,879 --> 00:23:02,009
She wouldn't have
offered if she wasn't willing.

306
00:23:02,342 --> 00:23:06,113
We had no choice back then,
with my first wife's passing.

307
00:23:06,179 --> 00:23:09,116
I even sent Hye-yoon to your place.

308
00:23:09,182 --> 00:23:13,061
Thinking about that time,
I'm so thankful to Yeon-kyung.

309
00:23:15,397 --> 00:23:17,648
I should've taken in mother then.

310
00:23:21,945 --> 00:23:26,300
I learned that being a mom to
a high school senior is no joke.

311
00:23:26,366 --> 00:23:29,161
And Hye-yoon even takes
care of herself quite well.

312
00:23:29,369 --> 00:23:30,369
Excuse me.

313
00:23:30,787 --> 00:23:32,164
Yes?

314
00:23:33,874 --> 00:23:36,960
Are you implying that Si-ho
can't do anything himself?

315
00:23:38,712 --> 00:23:41,506
No, of course not...

316
00:23:51,683 --> 00:23:53,393
This is puffer fish sashimi.

317
00:23:56,772 --> 00:24:00,609
Alongside it is 20-year-old
soy sauce. Have a great meal.

318
00:24:01,068 --> 00:24:04,071
Can I get some hot pepper paste?

319
00:24:04,529 --> 00:24:06,364
Yes, I'll bring you some.

320
00:24:12,370 --> 00:24:13,556
Nice! Nice!

321
00:24:13,622 --> 00:24:15,040
We lost again!

322
00:24:16,208 --> 00:24:17,209
Oh man...

323
00:24:20,796 --> 00:24:22,464
Chug it!

324
00:24:22,756 --> 00:24:25,842
Chug it! Chug it!

325
00:24:25,967 --> 00:24:28,470
Chug it! Chug it!

326
00:24:28,595 --> 00:24:29,530
Chug it!

327
00:24:29,596 --> 00:24:32,283
He can't drink. I'll drink it for him.

328
00:24:32,349 --> 00:24:35,435
Drinking is not even a
penalty for a whale like you.

329
00:24:45,195 --> 00:24:48,240
<i>The person you're
calling is not available...</i>

330
00:25:07,843 --> 00:25:11,680
<i>Where are you, Si-ho?
Call me after private class.</i>

331
00:25:12,889 --> 00:25:14,516
This is suffocating.

332
00:25:17,811 --> 00:25:19,729
I can't breathe...

333
00:25:20,981 --> 00:25:22,232
Oh gosh.

334
00:25:28,405 --> 00:25:29,823
How was the food?

335
00:25:31,658 --> 00:25:32,783
Very good.

336
00:25:33,326 --> 00:25:34,744
Pretty good, right?

337
00:25:36,329 --> 00:25:38,331
I'm glad you enjoyed it.

338
00:25:38,748 --> 00:25:40,601
This restaurant was featured
in the Michelin Guide...

339
00:25:40,625 --> 00:25:42,294
Is that so?

340
00:25:46,423 --> 00:25:50,177
Could we be friends?

341
00:25:51,052 --> 00:25:56,433
No, I prefer not. I'd be uncomfortable.

342
00:25:59,269 --> 00:26:02,105
Yes, ma'am.

343
00:26:23,001 --> 00:26:24,001
Here.

344
00:26:27,422 --> 00:26:28,422
Here?

345
00:26:28,548 --> 00:26:29,548
No, to the right.

346
00:26:29,591 --> 00:26:31,009
Here?

347
00:26:32,219 --> 00:26:33,802
Look at the mirror.

348
00:26:44,397 --> 00:26:45,941
What is she on about?

349
00:26:49,027 --> 00:26:50,820
Ugh, really?

350
00:26:55,158 --> 00:26:56,910
Mom called.

351
00:26:57,702 --> 00:27:01,706
She said Yeon-kyung was
emptying her bank account.

352
00:27:04,542 --> 00:27:07,545
Nothing your wife does
will put her in good light.

353
00:27:07,754 --> 00:27:12,026
To be frank, you just don't
want to lose face as a doctor

354
00:27:12,092 --> 00:27:14,344
for sending his mom to a nursing home.

355
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:16,429
Lose face?

356
00:27:17,222 --> 00:27:19,808
Fine, how come you don't save face?

357
00:27:20,558 --> 00:27:23,520
I stopped caring for that
after having a baby in my 50s.

358
00:27:24,312 --> 00:27:27,232
Anyway, I get nervous whenever 
you want to have dinner.

359
00:27:27,607 --> 00:27:31,069
Always saying nonsense after
feeding me expensive food.

360
00:27:31,735 --> 00:27:32,988
By the way,

361
00:27:34,781 --> 00:27:38,243
your hospital's treating
Kim Na-rae, right?

362
00:27:40,036 --> 00:27:41,847
I'm representing her perpetrator.

363
00:27:41,913 --> 00:27:45,166
Incredible. You'll do
anything for money.

364
00:27:46,001 --> 00:27:47,811
Her mother implies
that it was intentional.

365
00:27:47,877 --> 00:27:50,814
That's her opinion. It
looks to be self-defense.

366
00:27:50,879 --> 00:27:53,400
At worse, involuntary manslaughter.

367
00:27:53,466 --> 00:27:55,319
How can you tell?

368
00:27:55,385 --> 00:27:57,988
That's not important.
It's the law that judges.

369
00:27:58,054 --> 00:28:01,492
The kid's hurt and her dad's dead,
and the truth isn't important?

370
00:28:01,558 --> 00:28:03,661
Just involuntary manslaughter?

371
00:28:03,727 --> 00:28:07,187
It's not me saying that, it's the law.

372
00:28:08,023 --> 00:28:10,709
Tell her mom to settle this.

373
00:28:10,775 --> 00:28:14,112
Who do you think will
bleed if they go to trial?

374
00:28:15,238 --> 00:28:17,282
And you'll be the one
who will bleed them.

375
00:28:20,952 --> 00:28:23,413
Make sure you save her.

376
00:28:23,705 --> 00:28:26,833
We want that more than anything.

377
00:28:28,126 --> 00:28:30,920
You have a thing for
making me lose my appetite.

378
00:28:31,129 --> 00:28:33,648
You're doing your work,
and I'm doing mine.

379
00:28:33,715 --> 00:28:38,112
You're doing it to make money,
and I'm doing it to save people.

380
00:28:38,177 --> 00:28:43,075
I'm evil and you're
noble, so be a filial son.

381
00:28:43,141 --> 00:28:46,561
Why? You're the one with more kids.

382
00:28:48,897 --> 00:28:49,898
Hey.

383
00:28:51,816 --> 00:28:53,068
Filial son.

384
00:28:54,402 --> 00:28:56,672
<i>Keep your mother's
smile for a long time.</i>

385
00:28:56,738 --> 00:28:58,948
<i>Treatment begins as soon as you enter.</i>

386
00:29:04,704 --> 00:29:08,541
Rich people first again?
Looks like they're gone already.

387
00:29:09,751 --> 00:29:11,628
If you're jealous,
open your own clinic.

388
00:29:12,003 --> 00:29:14,547
He got his key and
went to the parking lot.

389
00:29:16,257 --> 00:29:18,802
A lawyer who drinks and drives.

390
00:29:20,762 --> 00:29:22,889
What did you two talk about?

391
00:29:24,057 --> 00:29:26,101
Free meals do not exist.

392
00:29:26,393 --> 00:29:28,829
I'm lucky if I don't get an
upset stomach from his meal.

393
00:29:28,895 --> 00:29:30,622
Come on.

394
00:29:30,688 --> 00:29:34,025
Plenty of brothers never share a meal.

395
00:29:34,317 --> 00:29:36,027
I guess you had fun tonight.

396
00:29:36,694 --> 00:29:37,987
That resort...

397
00:29:38,738 --> 00:29:42,659
I mean nursing home.
Should we check it out?

398
00:29:42,951 --> 00:29:43,993
What?

399
00:29:45,537 --> 00:29:47,014
You want to?

400
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:49,332
I heard about that place.

401
00:29:49,499 --> 00:29:52,794
- Top medical staff...
- Sir! Over here!

402
00:29:57,757 --> 00:29:59,342
Sorry for being late!

403
00:30:05,265 --> 00:30:06,641
What was that?

404
00:30:06,975 --> 00:30:09,477
What would've happened
if I swerved and hit you?

405
00:30:09,769 --> 00:30:11,205
Go away!

406
00:30:11,271 --> 00:30:14,190
Would it have been
intentional or by mistake?

407
00:30:14,441 --> 00:30:19,737
The court will take into account
that you were standing on the road.

408
00:30:20,238 --> 00:30:21,799
But if you hire

409
00:30:21,865 --> 00:30:25,743
an expensive lawyer like me,
it'd be involuntary manslaughter.

410
00:30:26,327 --> 00:30:27,328
Later.

411
00:30:28,329 --> 00:30:29,581
See you soon!

412
00:30:30,039 --> 00:30:31,039
Ma'am!

413
00:30:37,922 --> 00:30:39,591
That crazy bitch...

414
00:30:52,645 --> 00:30:54,397
Don't speak fucking English!

415
00:31:07,452 --> 00:31:08,346
Aren't we going home?

416
00:31:08,412 --> 00:31:10,330
Holy fucking shit!

417
00:31:11,539 --> 00:31:12,832
Christ...

418
00:31:20,048 --> 00:31:23,551
Si-ho! Wait for me!

419
00:32:48,344 --> 00:32:50,030
Why didn't you answer your phone?

420
00:32:50,096 --> 00:32:51,764
Did something happen?

421
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:54,559
I didn't know my phone was off.

422
00:32:55,476 --> 00:32:59,188
I called your private class,
you didn't attend math.

423
00:32:59,814 --> 00:33:03,651
I was tired after English, so
I napped at the gaming café.

424
00:33:05,737 --> 00:33:09,157
You know how hard it was
to get you into that class?

425
00:33:09,407 --> 00:33:11,784
Others are studying harder than you.

426
00:33:12,619 --> 00:33:15,496
What? A gaming café? With who?

427
00:33:16,289 --> 00:33:19,542
Forget it, don't be dramatic.

428
00:33:22,337 --> 00:33:23,713
Did you drink?

429
00:33:24,172 --> 00:33:26,549
Really? I'm going to sleep.

430
00:33:27,925 --> 00:33:29,552
Hey, Si-ho!

431
00:33:31,596 --> 00:33:33,431
I'm so exhausted!

432
00:33:39,145 --> 00:33:40,271
Sweetheart.

433
00:33:41,397 --> 00:33:44,025
If it's too much, should
we drop some classes?

434
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:46,444
Hm?

435
00:33:52,408 --> 00:33:53,927
<i>Student Record</i>

436
00:33:53,993 --> 00:33:57,830
He transferred to this neighborhood
during middle school, right?

437
00:33:58,539 --> 00:33:59,434
Yes.

438
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:03,103
He was already behind
when he transferred.

439
00:34:03,169 --> 00:34:06,547
If he falls behind anymore,
he won't go to a good college.

440
00:34:10,259 --> 00:34:17,350
Can't your husband create a
field study for him at the hospital?

441
00:34:21,604 --> 00:34:23,439
Must we go that far?

442
00:34:25,566 --> 00:34:26,818
Good morning!

443
00:34:28,027 --> 00:34:30,029
<i>He's still not adjusting at school.</i>

444
00:34:30,613 --> 00:34:35,034
His homeroom teacher asked
if he could try a field study.

445
00:34:35,493 --> 00:34:38,830
Yeah, field study is great,
ask him if he wants to.

446
00:34:39,706 --> 00:34:43,209
No, I have to ask you.

447
00:34:44,585 --> 00:34:46,921
Because he'll do it at your hospital.

448
00:34:51,342 --> 00:34:52,342
Here?

449
00:34:52,552 --> 00:34:54,887
Let him get some dad benefits.

450
00:34:56,097 --> 00:34:58,015
<i>Let's not do that.</i>

451
00:34:59,934 --> 00:35:01,728
<i>You're making me sad.</i>

452
00:35:02,478 --> 00:35:04,772
<i>You said you'd pay
more attention to him.</i>

453
00:35:06,065 --> 00:35:09,068
Not paying attention is
paying attention at that age.

454
00:35:10,737 --> 00:35:15,116
Are you gonna keep this up?
Pretending to be the good cop?

455
00:35:15,450 --> 00:35:18,244
Who will get the blame
if he gets bad results?

456
00:35:23,875 --> 00:35:24,875
All right.

457
00:35:25,376 --> 00:35:27,085
<i>I'll talk to Si-ho fir...</i>

458
00:35:40,475 --> 00:35:44,353
The defendant felt
threatened for his safety,

459
00:35:44,896 --> 00:35:49,859
and stepped on the accelerator in
order to swerve around the victim.

460
00:35:50,193 --> 00:35:55,448
He panicked and could not swerve
enough to avoid hitting him.

461
00:35:56,073 --> 00:36:01,579
The defendant is remorseful of
the incident and is doing his best

462
00:36:01,954 --> 00:36:04,099
to settle with the victim's family.

463
00:36:04,165 --> 00:36:08,562
The defendant's act was
not intentional murder,

464
00:36:08,628 --> 00:36:12,465
but involuntary manslaughter
stemmed from a mistake.

465
00:36:16,177 --> 00:36:17,929
It's daddy.

466
00:36:36,489 --> 00:36:38,366
- Rice broth?
- Yeah.

467
00:36:40,034 --> 00:36:41,285
More milk?

468
00:37:03,181 --> 00:37:06,768
About volunteering at my hospital,

469
00:37:07,353 --> 00:37:11,524
you don't have to do
it, if you don't want to.

470
00:37:13,359 --> 00:37:15,170
If you think you'll be
proud of yourself...

471
00:37:15,236 --> 00:37:16,445
What do you think?

472
00:37:19,448 --> 00:37:23,619
I honestly don't think you should.

473
00:37:24,787 --> 00:37:26,497
If that's okay with you.

474
00:37:28,249 --> 00:37:29,250
Why?

475
00:37:31,294 --> 00:37:35,797
I want you to become
someone with high integrity.

476
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:40,052
Even if you don't go to a good college.

477
00:37:45,558 --> 00:37:47,685
All right, I won't do it.

478
00:37:48,768 --> 00:37:50,730
Good, that's my son.

479
00:37:52,398 --> 00:37:54,817
How do I tell this to mom?

480
00:38:32,939 --> 00:38:34,398
- Good morning.
- Hello.

481
00:38:36,901 --> 00:38:38,319
Good morning!

482
00:38:39,527 --> 00:38:40,964
- Good morning.
- Welcome.

483
00:38:41,030 --> 00:38:42,424
- It's been too long!
- Good to see you.

484
00:38:42,448 --> 00:38:43,866
Indeed.

485
00:38:44,617 --> 00:38:47,954
<i>Heshani is the girl we must focus on.</i>

486
00:38:49,163 --> 00:38:53,167
<i>At the age of 14, who requires
attention and protection,</i>

487
00:38:54,669 --> 00:39:00,591
<i>Heshani had to support herself
amidst her family's indifference.</i>

488
00:39:01,759 --> 00:39:04,446
<i>She resorted to panhandling,</i>

489
00:39:04,512 --> 00:39:08,349
<i>having grown up with dark
and scary childhood memories.</i>

490
00:39:09,684 --> 00:39:14,788
<i>And poverty made her weak,</i>

491
00:39:14,855 --> 00:39:19,944
<i>ignorance and abuse
made her life even darker.</i>

492
00:39:21,737 --> 00:39:25,950
<i>Heshani needs your attention and love.</i>

493
00:39:26,575 --> 00:39:29,262
<i>... assault against a homeless man.</i>

494
00:39:29,328 --> 00:39:33,141
<i>This incident was almost ignored,
but a security camera witnessed...</i>

495
00:39:33,207 --> 00:39:36,002
That story is blowing up lately.

496
00:39:36,752 --> 00:39:37,753
Yeah?

497
00:39:38,129 --> 00:39:41,757
<i>2 assaulters are wanted,
here is the full story.</i>

498
00:39:42,633 --> 00:39:47,822
<i>At 11:45 PM, a young couple starts
assaulting a man on the street.</i>

499
00:39:47,888 --> 00:39:48,574
How's Si-ho?

500
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:51,785
<i>The victim tries to defend himself
but the assault continues...</i>

501
00:39:51,851 --> 00:39:54,245
Yes, of course.

502
00:39:54,311 --> 00:39:55,980
He must be so big now.

503
00:39:56,397 --> 00:40:01,294
My boy doesn't listen to
me, that little bastard...

504
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:05,422
<i>They are seen dragging the
unconscious man into a dark alley.</i>

505
00:40:05,489 --> 00:40:07,050
- Careful.
- Yeah.

506
00:40:07,116 --> 00:40:11,203
<i>The assaulters are presumed
to be in their late teens.</i>

507
00:40:29,847 --> 00:40:34,786
<i>The owner of the security
camera reported to the police,</i>

508
00:40:34,852 --> 00:40:37,122
<i>and they are in search
of these two teens.</i>

509
00:40:37,188 --> 00:40:38,773
<i>Here's the full story.</i>

510
00:40:39,398 --> 00:40:44,652
<i>At 11:45 PM, a young couple starts
assaulting a man on the street.</i>

511
00:40:45,321 --> 00:40:47,549
<i>The victim tries to defend himself,</i>

512
00:40:47,614 --> 00:40:50,301
<i>but the assault
continues indiscriminately.</i>

513
00:40:50,367 --> 00:40:52,679
<i>The victim collapses on the ground,</i>

514
00:40:52,745 --> 00:40:55,498
<i>but the assault goes
on for over 30 minutes.</i>

515
00:40:55,915 --> 00:40:59,060
<i>They are seen dragging the
unconscious man into a dark alley.</i>

516
00:40:59,126 --> 00:41:04,507
<i>The assaulters are presumed
to be in their late teens.</i>

517
00:41:52,429 --> 00:41:53,639
I'm home.

518
00:42:28,757 --> 00:42:30,593
Put your clothes on.

519
00:42:54,992 --> 00:42:56,160
What is it?

520
00:42:57,953 --> 00:42:59,830
I saw something.

521
00:43:02,917 --> 00:43:04,043
See what?

522
00:43:06,128 --> 00:43:10,758
Two teens beating someone up.

523
00:43:16,722 --> 00:43:18,224
Did you see it?

524
00:43:23,604 --> 00:43:25,064
What is it?

525
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:29,151
One of the teens in the video...

526
00:43:39,703 --> 00:43:42,206
wore the same shirt as yours.

527
00:44:07,898 --> 00:44:09,316
It wasn't me.

528
00:44:10,776 --> 00:44:12,277
What's with you?

529
00:44:20,286 --> 00:44:21,370
Right.

530
00:44:22,288 --> 00:44:23,413
Right.

531
00:44:24,873 --> 00:44:26,333
It wasn't you.

532
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:37,511
It wasn't, it wasn't...

533
00:44:38,595 --> 00:44:39,972
Of course not...

534
00:44:48,980 --> 00:44:50,149
Come on in.

535
00:44:51,233 --> 00:44:52,901
Darling, what brings you here?

536
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:55,654
I want to talk to you about something.

537
00:44:57,156 --> 00:44:58,157
Yeah?

538
00:45:01,701 --> 00:45:02,701
What could it be?

539
00:45:03,162 --> 00:45:07,333
I know a girl, who might be in trouble.

540
00:45:08,542 --> 00:45:11,045
A girl you know? A friend?

541
00:45:11,503 --> 00:45:16,401
Not really a friend,
just a junior I know.

542
00:45:16,467 --> 00:45:18,384
<i>Legal Affairs Guideline</i>

543
00:45:18,509 --> 00:45:20,429
<i>The Art of Innocence</i>

544
00:45:21,347 --> 00:45:22,431
Go on.

545
00:45:26,143 --> 00:45:31,482
Dad, keep what I tell
you strictly confidential.

546
00:45:32,399 --> 00:45:37,363
You came to retain my services?

547
00:45:50,084 --> 00:45:51,251
What is it?

548
00:45:52,044 --> 00:45:53,587
Something serious?

549
00:46:34,002 --> 00:46:37,005
In your view, is this a crime,

550
00:46:37,881 --> 00:46:40,551
or can you make it go away?

551
00:46:54,648 --> 00:46:55,732
What are you doing?

552
00:46:56,024 --> 00:46:58,360
What was she wearing
when she came home late?

553
00:47:09,371 --> 00:47:10,371
This one.

554
00:47:13,333 --> 00:47:15,669
Why?

555
00:47:17,129 --> 00:47:18,714
What is it?

556
00:47:20,591 --> 00:47:23,927
<i>2 teenagers brutally
assaulted a homeless man.</i>

557
00:47:26,054 --> 00:47:27,556
<i>What do you think?</i>

558
00:47:27,931 --> 00:47:30,993
<i>...a security camera
witnessed the entire incident.</i>

559
00:47:31,059 --> 00:47:34,538
<i>The owner of the security
camera reported to the police,</i>

560
00:47:34,605 --> 00:47:38,334
<i>and they are in search
of these two teens.</i>

561
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:39,902
<i>Here's the full story.</i>

562
00:47:40,527 --> 00:47:42,196
Do we have a lighter?

563
00:47:42,863 --> 00:47:46,366
<i>...a young couple starts
assaulting a man on the street...</i>

564
00:48:02,216 --> 00:48:04,551
The victim has not regained
his consciousness.

565
00:48:06,011 --> 00:48:08,514
Let's start on the facial
composite when he wakes up.

566
00:48:09,431 --> 00:48:14,645
Yeah, and look into co-ed high
schools nearby and text me.

567
00:48:15,354 --> 00:48:16,355
Right away.

568
00:48:16,897 --> 00:48:18,815
Okay, thanks.

569
00:48:20,275 --> 00:48:23,237
We have to check cell signals
that passed through that alley.

570
00:48:24,279 --> 00:48:25,906
Get on it right away.

571
00:48:27,324 --> 00:48:28,575
Let's get them.

572
00:48:28,909 --> 00:48:30,076
Yes, sir.

573
00:48:39,962 --> 00:48:43,733
This is a service station
that runs 24 hours a day.

574
00:48:43,799 --> 00:48:47,652
We are able to meet any
emergencies that come up.

575
00:48:47,719 --> 00:48:52,492
As you know, our facility provides
both western and eastern medicine.

576
00:48:52,558 --> 00:48:55,393
And we have 4 live-in specialists.

577
00:49:06,363 --> 00:49:08,532
What's with you, drinking in daylight?

578
00:49:13,036 --> 00:49:14,121
Jae-gyu.

579
00:49:14,663 --> 00:49:15,663
Yeah?

580
00:49:16,498 --> 00:49:21,210
Now that I'm a parent, I think
I understand parents a bit.

581
00:49:22,212 --> 00:49:25,215
But I understand my
child less and less.

582
00:49:26,133 --> 00:49:28,051
I bet mom felt the same way.

583
00:49:31,221 --> 00:49:32,973
Can you figure Si-ho out?

584
00:49:34,474 --> 00:49:36,685
Kids nowadays don't
talk to their parents.

585
00:49:38,020 --> 00:49:39,813
Teens even more so.

586
00:49:48,280 --> 00:49:52,492
There's an assault video
that's going viral online.

587
00:49:54,161 --> 00:49:55,704
It was on the news too.

588
00:49:56,413 --> 00:50:01,501
Two teens assaulted a homeless man.

589
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:02,960
So?

590
00:50:05,088 --> 00:50:07,049
I think they're our kids.

591
00:50:10,802 --> 00:50:12,054
What are you talking about?

592
00:50:12,804 --> 00:50:14,640
Hye-yoon and Si-ho.

593
00:50:16,391 --> 00:50:21,146
The homeless man is in the ICU.

594
00:50:22,689 --> 00:50:24,483
He's not looking good.

595
00:50:28,027 --> 00:50:29,279
Wait...

596
00:51:37,222 --> 00:51:40,058
What happened? Was it an accident?

597
00:51:41,143 --> 00:51:42,143
A small deer.

598
00:51:43,061 --> 00:51:46,815
You should've gone to the
ER, why did you come home?

599
00:51:51,236 --> 00:51:52,463
Here's the next news.

600
00:51:52,529 --> 00:51:55,383
<i>In an underpass only 10
minutes from a police station,</i>

601
00:51:55,449 --> 00:51:59,637
<i>2 teenagers brutally
assaulted a homeless man.</i>

602
00:51:59,703 --> 00:52:04,975
<i>This incident was almost ignored,
but a security camera witnessed</i>

603
00:52:05,041 --> 00:52:06,768
<i>the entire incident...</i>

604
00:52:06,835 --> 00:52:08,085
You knew.

605
00:52:11,047 --> 00:52:12,047
Knew what?

606
00:52:12,340 --> 00:52:14,259
It's Si-ho and Hye-yoon, right?

607
00:52:16,261 --> 00:52:17,012
What?

608
00:52:17,262 --> 00:52:19,931
Is this them? Look at it!

609
00:52:23,393 --> 00:52:26,855
How is that Si-ho, no way.

610
00:52:29,232 --> 00:52:30,232
He said no.

611
00:52:30,484 --> 00:52:31,735
You talked to him?

612
00:52:33,111 --> 00:52:34,964
Yeah, he said it's not him.

613
00:52:35,030 --> 00:52:36,323
It's not?

614
00:52:37,574 --> 00:52:38,742
You sure?

615
00:52:40,869 --> 00:52:41,887
Here's the next news.

616
00:52:41,953 --> 00:52:44,724
<i>In an underpass only 10
minutes from a police station,</i>

617
00:52:44,790 --> 00:52:49,044
<i>2 teenagers brutally
assaulted a homeless man.</i>

618
00:52:51,087 --> 00:52:52,506
Stop watching that!

619
00:53:03,183 --> 00:53:04,601
Where is he right now?

620
00:53:05,352 --> 00:53:06,520
Don't.

621
00:53:07,896 --> 00:53:09,439
Just trust him.

622
00:53:09,815 --> 00:53:11,525
A parent should trust their child.

623
00:53:11,691 --> 00:53:13,568
This is beyond a trust issue!

624
00:53:14,527 --> 00:53:16,363
It's not him!

625
00:53:28,083 --> 00:53:29,876
Si-ho, I need to talk to you.

626
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:33,105
You step outside.

627
00:53:33,171 --> 00:53:34,398
He said it's not him.

628
00:53:34,464 --> 00:53:35,507
Si-ho.

629
00:53:36,383 --> 00:53:37,551
It's not me.

630
00:53:39,469 --> 00:53:40,512
Yang Si-ho.

631
00:53:40,762 --> 00:53:42,782
I didn't even ask you a question.

632
00:53:42,848 --> 00:53:44,808
I already finished talking to mom.

633
00:53:45,183 --> 00:53:46,935
Finished talking about what?

634
00:53:49,396 --> 00:53:51,439
Look into my eyes and tell me!

635
00:53:51,857 --> 00:53:53,584
Mother will hear you, he said no!

636
00:53:53,650 --> 00:53:55,277
You stay out of this!

637
00:53:57,279 --> 00:53:58,697
That wasn't me.

638
00:54:11,126 --> 00:54:12,878
Look into my eyes and tell me.

639
00:54:19,384 --> 00:54:21,177
I told mom already.

640
00:54:21,511 --> 00:54:24,848
Yang Si-ho! Is this you or not?

641
00:54:29,561 --> 00:54:30,561
No.

642
00:54:30,979 --> 00:54:32,063
It's not?

643
00:54:32,730 --> 00:54:34,232
Are you sure?

644
00:54:34,608 --> 00:54:36,735
He says no.

645
00:54:36,860 --> 00:54:38,337
Are you absolutely sure?

646
00:54:38,402 --> 00:54:40,196
Goddammit, it's not me!

647
00:54:41,072 --> 00:54:43,241
Are you nuts?! How could you hit him!

648
00:54:44,200 --> 00:54:45,053
Is it you or not!

649
00:54:45,119 --> 00:54:46,846
He denied it, stop it!

650
00:54:46,912 --> 00:54:48,097
Hye-yoon spilled everything!

651
00:54:48,163 --> 00:54:49,663
I don't know! It's not me!

652
00:54:50,081 --> 00:54:51,416
I don't even remember!

653
00:54:53,001 --> 00:54:55,980
Then are you saying she did it alone?

654
00:54:56,046 --> 00:54:57,922
Yeah, I didn't hit him!

655
00:54:58,506 --> 00:55:01,235
That bastard spit on us
and swore at us first!

656
00:55:01,301 --> 00:55:02,902
We were going to walk away,

657
00:55:02,969 --> 00:55:06,806
then he picked fight with us, and
she tried to shove him away.

658
00:55:07,431 --> 00:55:10,101
I only hit him a few times...

659
00:55:11,311 --> 00:55:13,288
You little...

660
00:55:13,355 --> 00:55:18,360
You're used to getting beaten
up, why hit someone suddenly?!

661
00:55:18,652 --> 00:55:21,488
- Come with me! Come!
- Honey, don't! No!

662
00:55:27,619 --> 00:55:28,703
Mom...

663
00:55:35,543 --> 00:55:38,630
Please, honey. Don't hit him.

664
00:55:40,590 --> 00:55:42,926
Please go, mother.

665
00:55:44,594 --> 00:55:47,514
He may look gentle, but he's cruel.

666
00:55:47,931 --> 00:55:49,099
Be careful.

667
00:55:49,641 --> 00:55:52,310
Okay, please go back to sleep.

668
00:56:31,766 --> 00:56:35,395
Our maid went all out for you.

669
00:56:37,063 --> 00:56:38,440
Have plenty.

670
00:56:39,649 --> 00:56:41,484
Is this someone's birthday dinner?

671
00:56:43,486 --> 00:56:46,406
I don't know if it's good
news or bad news for us,

672
00:56:46,739 --> 00:56:49,301
but the victim is still in a coma.

673
00:56:49,367 --> 00:56:51,161
What if he wakes up?

674
00:56:52,579 --> 00:56:54,831
We'll have to come up with a plan,

675
00:56:55,165 --> 00:56:57,935
but the real problem
is how viral the video is.

676
00:56:58,001 --> 00:57:00,545
Who'd recognize them as our kids?

677
00:57:01,046 --> 00:57:04,090
We know because we're their parents.

678
00:57:04,424 --> 00:57:07,552
Who knows, the video
isn't very clear though...

679
00:57:09,345 --> 00:57:11,056
Only Hye-yoon's face was visible.

680
00:57:11,848 --> 00:57:14,159
And just Si-ho's back.

681
00:57:14,225 --> 00:57:15,685
Is that important right now?

682
00:57:20,355 --> 00:57:21,858
Of all days,

683
00:57:23,068 --> 00:57:27,447
it's the day we got
together to have dinner.

684
00:57:27,697 --> 00:57:30,241
I told you we shouldn't go.

685
00:57:30,617 --> 00:57:31,910
I feel sorry.

686
00:57:32,368 --> 00:57:35,538
You feel sorry?

687
00:57:37,499 --> 00:57:40,210
I meant, I'm sorry.

688
00:57:43,713 --> 00:57:47,592
Why is this woman present
during our family meeting?

689
00:57:47,842 --> 00:57:49,945
Yeon-kyung, how could
you call her that?

690
00:57:50,011 --> 00:57:51,280
I have to change diapers.

691
00:57:51,346 --> 00:57:52,555
Do it here.

692
00:57:54,224 --> 00:57:55,642
We're eating here.

693
00:57:55,975 --> 00:57:57,644
Ji-su, please sit down.

694
00:58:06,653 --> 00:58:07,862
What is it?

695
00:58:10,824 --> 00:58:12,909
Get it to him in a lump sum.

696
00:58:14,619 --> 00:58:17,539
What could he say when he
can have the money now?!

697
00:58:18,498 --> 00:58:19,999
What the hell for?!

698
00:58:20,834 --> 00:58:23,461
If he was going to listen, he
would've already done so!

699
00:58:23,795 --> 00:58:25,588
Just get it done at once!

700
00:58:50,029 --> 00:58:51,256
What do the police know?

701
00:58:51,322 --> 00:58:55,451
There's no witness report,

702
00:58:55,702 --> 00:58:57,412
and the victim hasn't been IDed.

703
00:58:58,413 --> 00:59:00,224
Hye-yoon said there
wasn't anyone around.

704
00:59:00,290 --> 00:59:02,792
What if they turn themselves in?

705
00:59:03,293 --> 00:59:04,419
Honey!

706
00:59:06,921 --> 00:59:08,882
Will they get an extenuation?

707
00:59:09,632 --> 00:59:11,902
They'll need to retain a lawyer.

708
00:59:11,968 --> 00:59:14,429
Once charges are filed,

709
00:59:15,138 --> 00:59:18,766
it's crucial to know which
prosecutor will take on this case.

710
00:59:23,730 --> 00:59:25,231
What if they don't get caught?

711
00:59:25,940 --> 00:59:27,209
And if the homeless man dies...

712
00:59:27,275 --> 00:59:28,710
Then our kids become killers.

713
00:59:28,776 --> 00:59:30,320
Don't talk like that!

714
00:59:32,155 --> 00:59:33,531
I'm a doctor.

715
00:59:34,073 --> 00:59:35,783
I can't wish someone to die.

716
00:59:35,992 --> 00:59:36,992
Jae-gyu.

717
00:59:39,704 --> 00:59:44,667
Do you really want them
to turn themselves in?

718
00:59:48,421 --> 00:59:50,506
They have to be responsible.

719
00:59:53,551 --> 00:59:54,886
What about you?

720
00:59:55,637 --> 00:59:57,347
What do you want?

721
01:00:00,141 --> 01:00:01,351
I don't...

722
01:00:03,686 --> 01:00:07,690
want them to go to trial, nothing more.

723
01:00:08,107 --> 01:00:09,334
You want this covered up?

724
01:00:09,400 --> 01:00:11,253
We have to think about their future.

725
01:00:11,319 --> 01:00:16,741
And taking responsibility
isn't only reserved for them.

726
01:00:17,116 --> 01:00:21,013
It'd be problematic if a hotshot
lawyer's child becomes a killer?

727
01:00:21,079 --> 01:00:24,433
Be realistic, you saw those articles,

728
01:00:24,499 --> 01:00:28,002
public sentiment on
parents of these cases.

729
01:00:28,544 --> 01:00:34,359
I just want to assess the situation
as it develops and make a decision.

730
01:00:34,425 --> 01:00:38,596
So, wait till he dies and it
becomes a perfect crime?

731
01:00:38,805 --> 01:00:43,577
He won't live or die
because we want it that way.

732
01:00:43,643 --> 01:00:45,728
Do you even have a conscience?

733
01:00:52,694 --> 01:00:55,029
Which hospital is the victim at?

734
01:00:55,530 --> 01:00:56,531
Why?

735
01:00:57,865 --> 01:01:00,785
Just asking, I feel bad.

736
01:01:01,953 --> 01:01:04,163
You want to go visit him?

737
01:01:05,123 --> 01:01:09,877
I asked because I feel helpless,
as there's nothing we can do now.

738
01:01:10,295 --> 01:01:11,838
Why isn't there any?

739
01:01:12,463 --> 01:01:14,173
Exactly what I said.

740
01:01:14,716 --> 01:01:17,719
There's nothing we can
do to help the victim,

741
01:01:18,386 --> 01:01:20,305
and same for the kids.

742
01:01:21,723 --> 01:01:23,308
Nothing we can do?

743
01:01:25,226 --> 01:01:30,398
I told you, she wouldn't say
that if she was the real mother!

744
01:01:31,607 --> 01:01:32,418
Calm down.

745
01:01:32,484 --> 01:01:35,587
How could I? You're talking
about taking them to the police!

746
01:01:35,653 --> 01:01:36,653
Yeon-kyung.

747
01:01:36,696 --> 01:01:41,409
We're coming up with
options, so please calm down.

748
01:01:43,536 --> 01:01:44,996
Honey, Sa-rang.

749
01:01:45,621 --> 01:01:46,748
I'm leaving.

750
01:01:47,665 --> 01:01:51,044
How could a father
not take his son's side?

751
01:01:52,253 --> 01:01:54,630
You must be so proud to
be so rational right now.

752
01:01:55,173 --> 01:01:57,925
Kill me first if you say
anything like that again!

753
01:02:05,767 --> 01:02:10,980
When Si-ho was bullied at school,

754
01:02:12,106 --> 01:02:15,109
he was all 'Mr. Moral Compass'.

755
01:02:16,527 --> 01:02:18,529
Why are you bringing that up!

756
01:02:19,781 --> 01:02:24,952
If kids turned out like parents
intended, why'd anyone go to church?

757
01:02:26,120 --> 01:02:28,664
He has no clue how
worried and upset I was!

758
01:02:30,583 --> 01:02:33,044
You idiot, how could you not get it!

759
01:03:28,182 --> 01:03:30,643
How will you make
him take responsibility?

760
01:03:32,145 --> 01:03:34,313
Will you really let him go to juvie?

761
01:03:35,314 --> 01:03:42,822
A man could die, but you want
him to eat his meals, go to school,

762
01:03:43,698 --> 01:03:46,617
and live like nothing happened?
That makes sense?

763
01:03:49,078 --> 01:03:51,789
Hye-yoon's stepmom was right.

764
01:03:52,665 --> 01:03:54,375
There's nothing to do.

765
01:03:57,086 --> 01:03:59,088
Not a damn thing.

766
01:04:36,751 --> 01:04:37,877
Come with me.

767
01:04:41,380 --> 01:04:42,715
Where are you going?

768
01:04:43,591 --> 01:04:44,592
Get in.

769
01:04:45,009 --> 01:04:45,528
What?

770
01:04:45,594 --> 01:04:46,719
Get in the car!

771
01:04:49,472 --> 01:04:51,474
- Where are you going?
- The police station.

772
01:04:51,641 --> 01:04:53,059
What's with you?!

773
01:04:53,476 --> 01:04:55,603
Just stop it, are you nuts?!

774
01:04:55,853 --> 01:04:58,439
You won't report this,
you think you can?

775
01:04:58,940 --> 01:04:59,940
Yes.

776
01:05:07,573 --> 01:05:08,783
Then do it.

777
01:06:44,879 --> 01:06:47,632
What'd I do if I was
Hye-yoon's birth mom?

778
01:06:50,718 --> 01:06:53,179
Where should I put this?

779
01:06:53,763 --> 01:06:55,681
I had this thought,

780
01:06:56,724 --> 01:07:00,519
am I earnestly worrying about Hye-yoon,

781
01:07:01,687 --> 01:07:05,941
or worrying about you, Sa-rang and me.

782
01:07:10,321 --> 01:07:15,242
Have you ever openly talked with her?

783
01:07:16,994 --> 01:07:21,290
This is their matter, but
we aren't even curious

784
01:07:22,375 --> 01:07:24,835
about what they think.

785
01:08:11,924 --> 01:08:13,134
Why sigh?

786
01:08:16,262 --> 01:08:17,388
It's nothing.

787
01:08:19,849 --> 01:08:21,851
What will you do with him?

788
01:08:27,064 --> 01:08:29,150
If you ever mention reporting again,

789
01:08:31,777 --> 01:08:33,487
I will kill you.

790
01:08:37,533 --> 01:08:40,077
You saved the lives
of so many children.

791
01:08:41,120 --> 01:08:43,956
We did so many good deeds!

792
01:08:46,751 --> 01:08:48,586
We deserve that.

793
01:08:49,920 --> 01:08:51,796
Don't we?

794
01:09:04,143 --> 01:09:05,227
Here.

795
01:09:09,314 --> 01:09:12,026
Ha-yul, are you taking all your meds?

796
01:09:13,527 --> 01:09:15,946
Na-rae, Kim Na-rae.

797
01:09:19,950 --> 01:09:21,786
Right, Na-rae.

798
01:09:22,620 --> 01:09:25,997
Yes, she's taking all her meds.

799
01:09:26,207 --> 01:09:28,059
We'll continue monitoring her.

800
01:09:28,125 --> 01:09:33,606
Doctor, do the new meds
have any side effects?

801
01:09:33,671 --> 01:09:35,567
Is there a problem?

802
01:09:35,633 --> 01:09:38,344
Did you not explain the meds
properly to her guardian?

803
01:09:38,636 --> 01:09:40,262
I sure did.

804
01:09:40,429 --> 01:09:41,930
Then why is she asking that?

805
01:09:43,015 --> 01:09:45,285
I don't know, I'll explain it to...

806
01:09:45,351 --> 01:09:48,604
It's because you didn't
do it right the first time!

807
01:09:49,772 --> 01:09:52,650
I'm really sorry.

808
01:09:53,651 --> 01:09:57,613
Na-rae woke up 3 times last night,
so I thought it could be the meds.

809
01:09:59,573 --> 01:10:01,033
I guess not...

810
01:10:03,994 --> 01:10:05,412
Doctor.

811
01:10:06,539 --> 01:10:08,582
Your handkerchief.

812
01:10:09,416 --> 01:10:10,416
Oh...

813
01:10:12,670 --> 01:10:15,523
I'll explain it later. Sorry.

814
01:10:15,589 --> 01:10:17,049
Hello.

815
01:10:31,647 --> 01:10:32,791
You tattled on me, huh?

816
01:10:32,857 --> 01:10:34,083
You spilled your guts first.

817
01:10:34,149 --> 01:10:36,944
What's with that tone?
Gonna be an asshole now?

818
01:10:37,695 --> 01:10:39,488
So why did you have to tell uncle?

819
01:10:39,780 --> 01:10:42,366
The video's going viral,
I had to do something.

820
01:10:42,700 --> 01:10:46,345
I told him it was a friend's case,
but you told the truth, asshole.

821
01:10:46,412 --> 01:10:49,474
You lied that I beat him up
and you just stopped it.

822
01:10:49,540 --> 01:10:54,295
That's the truth, you
went crazy first, moron.

823
01:10:56,213 --> 01:10:58,757
I'm so fucked because of you.

824
01:11:03,595 --> 01:11:05,014
What did your dad say?

825
01:11:05,805 --> 01:11:09,202
He went ballistic, he was
gonna drag me to the police.

826
01:11:09,268 --> 01:11:11,353
To the police? You?

827
01:11:11,645 --> 01:11:14,607
Yeah, mom was bawling.

828
01:11:16,150 --> 01:11:18,152
It was embarrassing.

829
01:11:19,069 --> 01:11:21,405
Shit, uncle went all out.

830
01:11:25,284 --> 01:11:29,138
When I get accepted, I'm going
to my church, wanna come?

831
01:11:29,204 --> 01:11:30,747
I'm going back to my chapel.

832
01:11:30,956 --> 01:11:33,876
Yeah, good thinking.

833
01:11:34,960 --> 01:11:38,380
Volunteer there, like your dad.

834
01:13:11,640 --> 01:13:13,284
Anyway, you did well.

835
01:13:13,350 --> 01:13:16,562
Not at all, you did all the work.

836
01:13:17,021 --> 01:13:19,898
Please visit the victim at the
hospital as soon as possible.

837
01:13:24,862 --> 01:13:27,448
Do I have to go there?

838
01:13:28,532 --> 01:13:34,973
It'll be easier to settle if you
show how apologetic you are.

839
01:13:35,039 --> 01:13:36,832
And advantageous during trial too.

840
01:13:38,542 --> 01:13:40,836
Goddammit...

841
01:13:44,256 --> 01:13:47,342
I retained you to do this for me.

842
01:13:48,677 --> 01:13:50,470
We paid you enough.

843
01:13:55,684 --> 01:13:57,686
I told dad about it.

844
01:13:59,604 --> 01:14:01,899
Give them enough settlement.

845
01:14:02,524 --> 01:14:05,903
It pains me because of that kid.

846
01:14:09,531 --> 01:14:10,657
Good luck.

847
01:14:43,107 --> 01:14:44,191
Hye-yoon.

848
01:14:46,026 --> 01:14:47,986
It's been hard lately, right?

849
01:14:48,987 --> 01:14:50,072
What is?

850
01:14:51,323 --> 01:14:55,536
Is everything all right?

851
01:14:58,372 --> 01:15:00,249
What's with your concern?

852
01:15:22,020 --> 01:15:24,398
What the fuck.

853
01:15:42,791 --> 01:15:44,209
What's going on?

854
01:15:46,170 --> 01:15:47,461
Are you okay with this?

855
01:15:48,255 --> 01:15:50,132
She doesn't look affected.

856
01:15:51,341 --> 01:15:53,260
How could she not?

857
01:15:53,719 --> 01:15:58,557
She's scared, that's
why she came to me.

858
01:15:58,891 --> 01:16:01,685
If we cover it up as
if nothing happened,

859
01:16:03,520 --> 01:16:05,522
will this all disappear?

860
01:16:06,273 --> 01:16:08,150
Is that really best for her?

861
01:16:13,572 --> 01:16:15,282
Honey, she's...

862
01:16:17,075 --> 01:16:19,203
starting to scare me.

863
01:17:57,217 --> 01:17:58,319
Hi sweetie.

864
01:17:58,385 --> 01:18:00,488
<i>Dad! I got accepted.</i>

865
01:18:00,554 --> 01:18:02,615
<i>I got accepted, I'm so happy!</i>

866
01:18:02,680 --> 01:18:04,116
You got in?

867
01:18:04,182 --> 01:18:07,662
<i>Yup, I just checked the
letter. This is amazing.</i>

868
01:18:07,728 --> 01:18:10,081
Congratulations, you did good.

869
01:18:10,147 --> 01:18:14,126
<i>That thing you promised
to buy me, I picked it out.</i>

870
01:18:14,192 --> 01:18:14,878
<i>When you come home...</i>

871
01:18:14,944 --> 01:18:16,820
- Hye-yoon.
<i>- Yeah?</i>

872
01:18:18,363 --> 01:18:19,948
He's dead.

873
01:18:20,699 --> 01:18:21,783
<i>Who?</i>

874
01:18:24,411 --> 01:18:25,871
The homeless man.

875
01:18:26,204 --> 01:18:29,207
<i>Then isn't this over?</i>

876
01:18:34,755 --> 01:18:37,382
<i>I'm getting a call from
friends, I'll call you later.</i>

877
01:18:59,946 --> 01:19:01,490
Yes, go on.

878
01:19:15,545 --> 01:19:18,048
I understand.

879
01:19:57,754 --> 01:19:59,857
It's so dirty.

880
01:19:59,923 --> 01:20:01,776
- Let's get you changed.
- No, no, no!

881
01:20:01,842 --> 01:20:02,777
Oh gosh.

882
01:20:02,843 --> 01:20:05,696
- Not going, not going!
- Mother, this smells terrible.

883
01:20:05,762 --> 01:20:08,348
It's stinky everywhere!

884
01:20:09,766 --> 01:20:10,826
I ain't going!

885
01:20:10,892 --> 01:20:14,104
You're so strong.

886
01:20:15,772 --> 01:20:17,441
Yeah, what is it?

887
01:20:18,191 --> 01:20:19,651
Pull it out.

888
01:20:27,617 --> 01:20:28,743
Okay.

889
01:20:43,925 --> 01:20:45,361
Mother's all changed.

890
01:20:45,427 --> 01:20:47,028
Jesus Christ.

891
01:20:47,095 --> 01:20:50,640
You look so refreshed, and pretty.

892
01:20:51,975 --> 01:20:53,185
So stinky.

893
01:20:53,602 --> 01:20:56,479
- You'll feel better.
- Indeed.

894
01:20:57,689 --> 01:21:00,317
Stinky, stinky.

895
01:21:26,384 --> 01:21:31,723
Code Blue, 4th floor,
pediatrics, Code Blue.

896
01:21:32,307 --> 01:21:33,868
- Cardiac arrest!
- How long since CPR?

897
01:21:33,934 --> 01:21:35,477
2 minutes, doctor.

898
01:21:36,144 --> 01:21:37,395
Move aside.

899
01:21:37,729 --> 01:21:39,489
- Keep squeezing the Ambu bag.
- Yes, doctor.

900
01:21:39,523 --> 01:21:40,524
Connect the EKG.

901
01:21:47,030 --> 01:21:48,406
It's good, we got ROSC!

902
01:21:51,034 --> 01:21:52,034
Prep for surgery.

903
01:21:55,789 --> 01:21:56,831
Give me the tape!

904
01:21:57,415 --> 01:21:58,416
Tape!

905
01:22:25,318 --> 01:22:30,073
<i>That patient from the case you took on.</i>

906
01:22:33,243 --> 01:22:35,078
<i>The surgery went well,</i>

907
01:22:36,496 --> 01:22:38,290
<i>and she's alive.</i>

908
01:22:41,084 --> 01:22:45,255
That's great, you did your work.

909
01:22:46,214 --> 01:22:48,466
<i>I gotta go.</i>

910
01:23:05,233 --> 01:23:06,234
Nice!

911
01:23:10,280 --> 01:23:11,948
Pretty good.

912
01:23:16,995 --> 01:23:18,079
Si-ho.

913
01:23:19,331 --> 01:23:26,129
I'm honestly afraid that you
don't know what you did.

914
01:23:28,673 --> 01:23:32,469
Am I an idiot? How could I not know?

915
01:23:35,347 --> 01:23:37,349
So why did you hide it?

916
01:23:38,725 --> 01:23:40,435
She wanted to.

917
01:23:42,812 --> 01:23:45,357
She said no one would know it was us.

918
01:23:45,732 --> 01:23:49,653
Don't tell me what she
said. Tell me what you think.

919
01:23:52,447 --> 01:23:56,284
I was scared, for real.

920
01:24:04,459 --> 01:24:06,753
I didn't know he'd die.

921
01:24:09,839 --> 01:24:12,217
I didn't even hit him that hard.

922
01:24:14,552 --> 01:24:17,263
I've been beaten up even worse.

923
01:24:21,184 --> 01:24:23,186
And I didn't die...

924
01:24:27,649 --> 01:24:30,777
I was hit far harder by my bullies.

925
01:24:38,159 --> 01:24:39,327
Dad.

926
01:24:41,246 --> 01:24:42,831
What do I do now?

927
01:24:44,582 --> 01:24:46,543
Do I really turn myself in?

928
01:24:47,377 --> 01:24:49,379
Am I going to juvie?

929
01:24:50,921 --> 01:24:56,594
You'll be so embarrassed
of me if I end up there.

930
01:25:00,180 --> 01:25:03,560
A guy like me is better off dead.

931
01:25:09,607 --> 01:25:11,276
You punk...

932
01:25:15,655 --> 01:25:16,865
Si-ho.

933
01:25:17,907 --> 01:25:20,285
Why'd I be embarrassed of you?

934
01:25:21,703 --> 01:25:23,705
I'm always on your side.

935
01:25:24,956 --> 01:25:29,377
I've never doubted
that you'll end up well.

936
01:25:33,339 --> 01:25:34,924
From here on...

937
01:25:37,051 --> 01:25:40,430
you have to be good.

938
01:25:43,767 --> 01:25:44,934
Si-ho.

939
01:25:47,687 --> 01:25:49,397
Do you understand?

940
01:25:52,567 --> 01:25:54,152
Yeah, dad.

941
01:25:56,488 --> 01:25:59,866
I'm going to be good.

942
01:26:00,950 --> 01:26:06,997
I'll study hard and become
a good doctor like you.

943
01:26:07,332 --> 01:26:09,417
And do good deeds.

944
01:26:12,086 --> 01:26:14,756
Sure, sure.

945
01:26:25,850 --> 01:26:27,769
Come on.

946
01:27:51,144 --> 01:27:52,186
Dad.

947
01:27:53,938 --> 01:27:55,523
Hi uncle.

948
01:27:55,857 --> 01:27:57,400
Hey Si-ho.

949
01:27:58,359 --> 01:27:59,359
Si-ho.

950
01:28:05,241 --> 01:28:07,744
Thank you for looking out for us.

951
01:28:12,790 --> 01:28:15,960
Ask the maid to make you dinner.

952
01:28:16,419 --> 01:28:17,586
I will.

953
01:28:19,546 --> 01:28:21,382
Oh yeah, look at this.

954
01:28:26,054 --> 01:28:30,516
Tada! You promised me
a car if I got accepted.

955
01:28:31,309 --> 01:28:32,309
How's this?

956
01:28:45,198 --> 01:28:46,324
Welcome home.

957
01:28:46,783 --> 01:28:47,825
Not getting ready?

958
01:28:51,245 --> 01:28:52,956
I'm thinking of not going.

959
01:28:53,414 --> 01:28:54,540
How come?

960
01:28:58,336 --> 01:28:59,629
Just because.

961
01:29:01,839 --> 01:29:03,174
Please come.

962
01:29:04,717 --> 01:29:06,260
It's a family matter.

963
01:29:13,851 --> 01:29:14,852
Okay.

964
01:29:16,813 --> 01:29:18,314
I'll get ready.

965
01:29:24,903 --> 01:29:28,825
<i>Sound has been detected.</i>

966
01:29:35,164 --> 01:29:37,542
<i>- There, there.
- Sa-rang!</i>

967
01:29:41,004 --> 01:29:44,882
<i>- Is that right?
- She's smiling, look!</i>

968
01:29:45,675 --> 01:29:50,738
<i>I learned that life expectancy
of Koreans is 84 years.</i>

969
01:29:50,805 --> 01:29:54,017
<i>But hobos live 46 years.</i>

970
01:30:31,845 --> 01:30:33,347
Have a great meal.

971
01:30:38,770 --> 01:30:40,813
Congrats on Hye-yoon's acceptance.

972
01:30:41,731 --> 01:30:42,731
Congrats.

973
01:30:50,907 --> 01:30:53,076
Mom's moving out first of next month?

974
01:30:53,576 --> 01:30:55,203
Moving in, I mean.

975
01:30:55,578 --> 01:30:59,391
I've been told that it's best to
move when she's still mobile.

976
01:30:59,457 --> 01:31:02,168
So, she can participate
in classes and activities.

977
01:31:08,466 --> 01:31:11,803
I talked to a prosecutor I know.

978
01:31:15,765 --> 01:31:16,765
What for?

979
01:31:17,558 --> 01:31:19,310
I wanted to hear his opinion.

980
01:31:19,811 --> 01:31:20,954
What opinion?

981
01:31:21,020 --> 01:31:22,354
The incident with our kids.

982
01:31:25,483 --> 01:31:26,818
Isn't that all over?

983
01:31:27,193 --> 01:31:29,653
The only thing over is that man's life.

984
01:31:34,033 --> 01:31:35,409
What do you mean?

985
01:31:36,202 --> 01:31:37,620
Is there a problem?

986
01:31:37,829 --> 01:31:39,287
What did he say?

987
01:31:40,706 --> 01:31:44,293
They would be indicted for foul play.

988
01:31:50,758 --> 01:31:52,652
Indicted?

989
01:31:52,718 --> 01:31:57,348
I thought this was over.

990
01:31:58,349 --> 01:32:01,727
When you first insisted
that you report them,

991
01:32:02,728 --> 01:32:06,649
I wondered how a
parent could act like that.

992
01:32:07,233 --> 01:32:12,155
But now that I think about it,
this shouldn't be covered up.

993
01:32:12,738 --> 01:32:16,993
You told me not to be a hypocrite,
so why the change of heart?

994
01:32:17,493 --> 01:32:19,245
Is your conscience acting up?

995
01:32:21,289 --> 01:32:24,375
I was conflicted after my
chat with the prosecutor.

996
01:32:25,209 --> 01:32:26,919
But I changed my mind.

997
01:32:28,171 --> 01:32:32,150
I mean, I finally realized
what I had to do.

998
01:32:32,216 --> 01:32:34,552
What are you saying? Just spill it!

999
01:32:42,518 --> 01:32:44,437
I'm going to get Hye-yoon
to turn herself in.

1000
01:32:45,979 --> 01:32:50,026
And I'll stay on the sidelines.

1001
01:32:52,778 --> 01:32:54,280
For God's sake...

1002
01:32:55,198 --> 01:32:58,885
Did you suddenly become
an agent of justice?

1003
01:32:58,951 --> 01:33:03,164
Jae-wan, you don't mean it, right?

1004
01:33:03,497 --> 01:33:05,767
Si-ho is deeply remorseful.

1005
01:33:05,833 --> 01:33:10,338
This is a settled matter. How
could you decide on your own?

1006
01:33:11,046 --> 01:33:13,942
A person was killed

1007
01:33:14,008 --> 01:33:15,676
but we let it slide?

1008
01:33:16,010 --> 01:33:17,903
Is this really best for our children?

1009
01:33:17,970 --> 01:33:19,805
I'm sick of you brothers!

1010
01:33:20,430 --> 01:33:23,726
Driving me insane in turns!

1011
01:33:25,311 --> 01:33:29,232
It's been tough for us too.

1012
01:33:30,733 --> 01:33:33,444
You there, stay out of this.

1013
01:33:36,697 --> 01:33:38,508
If Hye-yoon's mom was alive,

1014
01:33:38,574 --> 01:33:40,910
she'd have sent her to
the police right away.

1015
01:33:41,744 --> 01:33:43,037
My wife feels the same way.

1016
01:33:44,580 --> 01:33:50,461
No one in the world would know
of this homeless man's existence.

1017
01:33:52,088 --> 01:33:55,049
He could have frozen
to death this winter.

1018
01:33:55,591 --> 01:33:58,594
You want to ruin Si-ho's
life over a person like that?

1019
01:34:00,388 --> 01:34:02,407
That's what the kids said.

1020
01:34:02,473 --> 01:34:04,600
Kids their age are all like that!

1021
01:34:04,892 --> 01:34:07,395
They were naïve and scared!

1022
01:34:08,979 --> 01:34:11,857
They weren't really
trying to kill a person.

1023
01:34:19,365 --> 01:34:21,659
<i>She's smiling, look!</i>

1024
01:34:23,035 --> 01:34:28,141
<i>I learned that life expectancy
of Koreans is 84 years.</i>

1025
01:34:28,207 --> 01:34:32,628
<i>But hobos live 46
years, that's their fate.</i>

1026
01:34:32,753 --> 01:34:33,772
<i>Then...</i>

1027
01:34:33,838 --> 01:34:37,216
<i>He didn't die because of
us, but of natural causes.</i>

1028
01:34:37,591 --> 01:34:39,844
<i>Shit, it's all over then.</i>

1029
01:34:41,429 --> 01:34:42,847
<i>What about your dad?</i>

1030
01:34:43,097 --> 01:34:44,950
<i>I bawled and said I
wanted to be like him.</i>

1031
01:34:45,016 --> 01:34:47,393
<i>He fucking said I can start being good.</i>

1032
01:34:47,643 --> 01:34:49,437
<i>Fuck that.</i>

1033
01:34:49,603 --> 01:34:51,039
<i>Wanna watch it again?</i>

1034
01:34:51,104 --> 01:34:52,398
<i>Play it.</i>

1035
01:34:53,399 --> 01:34:55,359
<i>Sa-rang, wanna watch it too?</i>

1036
01:34:55,901 --> 01:34:59,839
<i>It's so fucking exhilarating
every time I watch it.</i>

1037
01:34:59,905 --> 01:35:02,908
<i>- Sa-rang, this is your sister.
- Don't overreact.</i>

1038
01:35:03,159 --> 01:35:05,661
<i>If it was just you, he
wouldn't have died.</i>

1039
01:35:06,245 --> 01:35:08,080
<i>I knee kicked him so hard!</i>

1040
01:35:09,290 --> 01:35:11,726
<i>How did he not die after that beating?</i>

1041
01:35:11,792 --> 01:35:14,336
<i>Did you fucking see
that? Right in the head.</i>

1042
01:35:14,545 --> 01:35:18,716
<i>So happy he's dead. I covered your ass.</i>

1043
01:35:19,300 --> 01:35:21,677
<i>Fuck that, shut the hell up.</i>

1044
01:35:22,970 --> 01:35:25,598
<i>I should've hit him harder.</i>

1045
01:35:26,307 --> 01:35:28,392
<i>That kick sucked!</i>

1046
01:35:29,018 --> 01:35:30,853
<i>There I go!</i>

1047
01:35:33,147 --> 01:35:34,607
<i>Damn!</i>

1048
01:35:36,567 --> 01:35:38,611
<i>So fucking funny.</i>

1049
01:35:44,116 --> 01:35:47,328
They said those things for fun.

1050
01:35:47,828 --> 01:35:51,791
You took that literally?
They're just kids!

1051
01:35:52,541 --> 01:35:58,881
No, our kids are exploiting
the fact that they're minors.

1052
01:35:59,298 --> 01:36:02,676
So, you'll take care of this legally?

1053
01:36:03,260 --> 01:36:06,281
They should be held accountable,
you said just that.

1054
01:36:06,347 --> 01:36:10,851
You think you can live with
Hye-yoon after reporting her?

1055
01:36:11,185 --> 01:36:13,979
So, cover it up forever for
the sake of family harmony?

1056
01:36:14,604 --> 01:36:16,324
Would I be able to look
Hye-yoon in the eye?

1057
01:36:16,357 --> 01:36:18,501
Jae-wan, you're being too cruel to us.

1058
01:36:18,567 --> 01:36:22,738
He forgave his bullies, but
he has to pay for his crimes?!

1059
01:36:23,155 --> 01:36:25,449
He can live his life in remorse!

1060
01:36:25,950 --> 01:36:28,828
There is such a thing
as jail in our hearts!

1061
01:36:30,121 --> 01:36:33,082
Jae-wan, you need to settle, right?

1062
01:36:33,541 --> 01:36:35,709
A settlement with a
patient in my hospital.

1063
01:36:36,210 --> 01:36:40,798
I'll convince her mom,
listen to me on this, okay?

1064
01:36:41,132 --> 01:36:42,508
Are you brokering a deal?

1065
01:36:43,509 --> 01:36:46,137
I've never asked you for anything.

1066
01:36:47,095 --> 01:36:49,074
I'll convince her mom!

1067
01:36:49,140 --> 01:36:52,435
I'll get that settlement for you.

1068
01:36:52,852 --> 01:36:56,564
Moron, that's nothing at all.

1069
01:36:59,692 --> 01:37:04,589
So you ditched your
conscience for nothing?

1070
01:37:04,655 --> 01:37:09,535
You claim innocence for criminals
but you'll report your own kid?!

1071
01:37:11,495 --> 01:37:12,495
Jae-wan.

1072
01:37:13,997 --> 01:37:15,708
Si-ho is...

1073
01:37:16,625 --> 01:37:18,586
weak.

1074
01:37:18,919 --> 01:37:23,757
He was born feeble, body and mind.

1075
01:37:24,091 --> 01:37:26,886
I didn't realize that before all this.

1076
01:37:28,220 --> 01:37:30,180
But what can I do?

1077
01:37:31,140 --> 01:37:33,392
He's still my son.

1078
01:37:35,060 --> 01:37:38,229
He deserves a second chance!

1079
01:37:46,697 --> 01:37:53,412
What if this second chance makes
him continue to live like this?

1080
01:37:54,872 --> 01:37:58,560
You've got no fucking right to
be so conclusive about my son!

1081
01:37:58,626 --> 01:38:00,645
This isn't fucking you!

1082
01:38:00,711 --> 01:38:06,467
This could be the golden
time to fix our kids.

1083
01:38:08,594 --> 01:38:11,639
They have to pay some price
for their crimes, at least,

1084
01:38:12,139 --> 01:38:14,391
to have a chance to live
with some humanity.

1085
01:38:14,642 --> 01:38:16,143
Enough of your bullshit!

1086
01:38:17,228 --> 01:38:19,122
You won't report them, right?

1087
01:38:19,188 --> 01:38:21,332
You're just trying to mess with me!

1088
01:38:21,398 --> 01:38:22,625
Jae-gyu.

1089
01:38:22,691 --> 01:38:26,028
We lived under one
roof for over 20 years.

1090
01:38:26,612 --> 01:38:29,073
You really think I'd lie to you?

1091
01:38:33,661 --> 01:38:35,704
If you report this, you're dead.

1092
01:38:35,912 --> 01:38:40,209
He's my son! You've got nothing
to do with him, asshole!

1093
01:38:40,459 --> 01:38:45,089
I'm going to the police in
the morning with Hye-yoon.

1094
01:38:52,012 --> 01:38:53,264
Jae-gyu.

1095
01:38:54,055 --> 01:38:55,516
Come with me.

1096
01:39:19,247 --> 01:39:20,934
Don't you dare touch my son.

1097
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:24,211
If you do, I'll kill you.

1098
01:39:46,817 --> 01:39:48,277
I'm really sorry.

1099
01:39:49,236 --> 01:39:53,032
Could you clean this up
and bring out new dishes?

1100
01:39:53,407 --> 01:39:54,051
Yes, sir.

1101
01:39:54,117 --> 01:39:55,200
Honey.

1102
01:39:57,911 --> 01:39:59,246
Let's leave.

1103
01:40:02,416 --> 01:40:03,709
Should we?

1104
01:40:46,543 --> 01:40:47,795
My cell phone.

1105
01:40:48,336 --> 01:40:49,463
I'll get it.

1106
01:40:49,630 --> 01:40:51,006
No, I'll go.

1107
01:40:51,632 --> 01:40:53,050
Stay in the car.

1108
01:40:56,887 --> 01:40:58,990
My apologies. We're
bringing out your car.

1109
01:40:59,055 --> 01:41:00,700
Do you have a cigarette?

1110
01:41:00,766 --> 01:41:02,518
Yes, one moment.

1111
01:41:07,064 --> 01:41:08,148
One second.

1112
01:41:17,491 --> 01:41:18,826
It's all right.

1113
01:43:25,744 --> 01:43:35,796

1120
01:44:15,502 --> 01:44:17,838
Could the two ladies
come forward slightly?

1121
01:44:19,089 --> 01:44:21,133
Check each other's expressions.

1122
01:44:21,592 --> 01:44:22,593
What?

1123
01:44:23,552 --> 01:44:24,803
All good?

1124
01:44:25,220 --> 01:44:27,740
Second son, lighten up please.

1125
01:44:27,805 --> 01:44:28,408
Okay.

1126
01:44:28,474 --> 01:44:32,311
First son, drop your chin a bit,
something bad happen at home?

1127
01:44:33,729 --> 01:44:36,148
Happy faces, that's great.

1128
01:44:36,732 --> 01:44:38,567
