1
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:10,480
Kita! How are you? I missed you so much!

2
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:12,840
How are you? Haven't seen you for a long time.

3
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:14,960
I'm good, what about you?

4
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,320
I'm good, the usual, you know?

5
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:29,960
Um, I was a little bit too happy. I forgot to introduce him. This is Kita. Do you remember? I've told you about him during our time in University.

6
00:01:31,039 --> 00:01:32,080
Hello

7
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:35,160
Hello

8
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:42,479
And this is Kengkla, my friend from the agency. He's also my roommate.

9
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,680
Is Kengkla your best friend from university?

10
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:49,759
Yes, I am

11
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:53,440
We haven't met since then, have we?

12
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:55,440
We haven't.

13
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:59,440
I tried texting you, but you don't even read.

14
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:04,560
That was when we just broke up. Who would dare to read?

15
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,600
I thought it was something else. Why did you choose to break up with me then?

16
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:16,320
Namo, didn't you say you were hungry? Let's go get some food.

17
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:21,200
Oh right? Let's have a meal together since we haven't met for so long.

18
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,240
Are you hungry? So we can talk.

19
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:26,120
Please.

20
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:27,600
I'll wait here.

21
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:36,160
I'll take this one and that one.

22
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:43,880
Umm and which one else should I take? Okay, this one and this one and that one.

23
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:46,480
What would you like to order?

24
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,920
I'd like to have Chicken Kaphrao rice with fried egg on top.

25
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,200
Me too

26
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,440
Then two.

27
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:53,160
Two Kraphrao rice.

28
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,120
Three

29
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:56,000
Alright, three kraphrao rice.

30
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,160
What are you doing lately?

31
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:04,560
Lately? I'm a trainee under MChange. How about you?

32
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:08,640
I'm also a trainee but under KJ Agency.

33
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:12,520
Oh? We're rivals, then.

34
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,080
Yes

35
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:19,040
Where did it go?

36
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,200
What happened?

37
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,360
Nothing; I'm finding something but can’t find it.

38
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,760
Kita, so now you're under MChange. Is it hard?

39
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:41,040
Yes, It's quite difficult. And I'm tired and..

40
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:43,320
Is weight training the main thing you do when you're there?

41
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,840
Does it hurt because you work out so hard? You look muscly.

42
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,760
well, yeah

43
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:53,160
You look buff. Can you tighten your shoulders a bit?

44
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:58,680
Wow, so thick. Your shoulders look circular.

45
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:02,280
Really? maybe because I train so hard.

46
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:04,280
Is that so? Can you help me with training as well?

47
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:08,160
Of course, yes.

48
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,880
I'm glad I met you today

49
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,640
So am I.

50
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,040
You can call me any time

51
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:17,360
I'll go now.

52
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,440
Bye-bye; see you later.

53
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,040
I'm going.

54
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,160
Bye

55
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:31,320
What's wrong with you?

56
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,240
Nothing.

57
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,120
Okay then.

58
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,200
Where did you go?

59
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,880
I went out to find something to eat.

60
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,960
Why didn't you invite me?

61
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,920
I thought you weren't hungry.

62
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,040
I'm sorry.

63
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,800
Don't touch me.

64
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Here! I bought you your favourite cake.

65
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,480
Please don't sulk.

66
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,800
Let me give you a kiss on the cheek.

67
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:34,840
Alright, don't do it again next time.

68
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:42,240
Then go take a shower first, and I'll make you breakfast.

69
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:48,080
Cook later. Let's take a shower together.

70
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,800
Then what are you waiting for?

71
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,080
I'm sorry for causing you trouble.

72
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:53,880
"It's okay, not a big deal. I'm willing to help.

73
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,800
I really feel like I am a burden on everyone

74
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,880
Do you have something to say?

75
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:17,000
Don't think that way. It's an accident. No one wants to hurt their own leg, right?

76
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:24,120
Good, let's go to practise.

77
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:50,080
What's wrong? Why are you angry with me?

78
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,400
I don't like it.

79
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:02,200
You don't like it? like what?

80
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,160
When you met that Kita boy.

81
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:12,960
You made me feel like I'm not there. I'm your best friend, though?

82
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,720
Not funny.

83
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:27,360
I'm sorry.

84
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:31,520
I actually knew it that you're not okay.

85
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,400
But you were cute, so I wanted to tease you.

86
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:44,760
Is it fun for you to toy with other people's feelings like this?

87
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:50,000
I'm sorry.

88
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:01,000
To be honest, I'm not that angry.

89
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,760
If so..

90
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:09,920
we're okay then?

91
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,400
yes

92
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,280
Tonnam

93
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:50,400
What's up?

94
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,160
Let's practise.

95
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:55,560
Fortunately, I'm the one who saw it.

96
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:58,240
If it wasn't me, you and Kengkla will be in trouble.

97
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:59,640
I know.

98
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,520
Like this. One, two, three.

99
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:34,560
Hello

100
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:37,240
Hello

101
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:45,480
Today, I'll give you a new assignment.

102
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:51,120
I'll regroup, so everyone will be able to work together more thoroughly.

103
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:55,720
Today's assignment will be about singing and dancing as usual.

104
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:59,080
Singing and dancing again?

105
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:02,680
Yes, so I can see the improvement from last time.

106
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:07,400
Again? I don't wanna do this anymore.

107
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:10,000
Just do it.

108
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:17,320
The first group includes Trin, Copper and Namo.

109
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:22,320
The second group includes Tul, Kengkla and Mungkorn.

110
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:26,280
The last group, Phupa, Tonnam and Mawin.

111
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:30,200
I'll let Pim hand out the song.

112
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,400
Okay

113
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,880
Pass them on to your friends.

114
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:46,800
This time, I want everyone to give their best effort, focusing on both singing and dancing well

115
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:51,120
The company will grant a 'pass' in the evaluation for those who performed better than last time

116
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,960
Also, this is going to be your song.

117
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:58,240
I hope all of you will do a better job than last time.

118
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:01,280
Anyway, keep going.

119
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:04,040
Thank you.

120
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:16,680
Everyone, come here. Come.

121
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:23,440
So, are we here to be actors or a boy band?

122
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:29,040
I'm getting confused now. Didn't we audition for actors?

123
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,160
Yeah

124
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:32,080
I'm getting bored now.

125
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:38,560
Come on. Keep calm. The company might already have a plan.

126
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,880
We just have to do our best.

127
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:44,280
Let's practise.

128
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:51,480
We can now disperse into the groups we divided up just now.

129
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:54,640
Tul, let's go.

130
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,680
So last time..

131
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,320
Is Mungkorn coming?

132
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:06,160
So they want us to come up with our own choreography?

133
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:18,840
Tonnam

134
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:21,000
Thank you

135
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:30,080
It's itchy, isn't it?

136
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:36,880
Yes and it is very annoying.

137
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,080
When are you taking it off?

138
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:43,240
I'm wearing it for the last day. I also have an appointment with the doctor today.

139
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,880
Do you want me to accompany you?

140
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:55,040
Are you sure? I really appreciate it

141
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:58,320
Of course! I have time now. No worries.

142
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:01,920
Alright then.

143
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:08,760
No need to scratch. You'll be taking it off tomorrow.

144
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:19,960
Did you wait long? My practice ended late.

145
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:24,880
It's okay. Someone on my team had to leave early, so the practice ended more quickly.

146
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,400
Are you upset?

147
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,640
No, I'm not.

148
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,800
If so, why are you making that face?

149
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:40,040
Well, maybe a little bit upset. I'm hungry, and I've been waiting for so long.

150
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,880
I'll get you some yummy stuff then.

151
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:50,360
Um, can I have another yummy thing?

152
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,560
Stop being so cheeky.

153
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,360
I didn't have enough this morning.

154
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,880
Kita

155
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:01,560
Are you tired today?

156
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,320
A little.

157
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,480
What do you want to eat? Hungry?

158
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:06,520
Very much.

159
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:14,000
You just said I'm cheeky but you're the one being cheeky now.

160
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:14,560
I'm joking.

161
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:17,680
I'm up for anything! Let's go; I'm getting super hungry.

162
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,120
Let's go.

163
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:21,640
What should we eat?

164
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:28,680
Are you still here?

165
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:29,800
Yeah

166
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:34,120
I thought you had already left.

167
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:38,840
I continued practising because I feel like I didn't do well today.

168
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,000
Why are you two not leaving yet?

169
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,480
We practised too. I couldn't catch up with the dance.

170
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:53,280
It's good that you're aware of it. Practice makes perfect.

171
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:55,840
Don't assume being the president's nephew gives you the freedom to do whatever you want.

172
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:58,840
I won't be okay with that.

173
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:05,960
What's the matter with him?

174
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:07,960
Don't know. Let's just go.

175
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,400
Take a seat slowly.

176
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,839
Okay

177
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:25,560
Be careful.

178
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:35,480
Here's the medicine. I'm leaving. Call me if you need something.

179
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:36,640
Wait.

180
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:43,800
Can you stay with me for a little while?

181
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:46,520
Sure.

182
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:57,560
I'm very grateful to you for taking care of me.

183
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,560
Anytime.

184
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:05,720
Okay

185
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:08,640
Do you have something on your mind?

186
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,200
You look like you want to say something, but you never actually say it.

187
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,440
Well..

188
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:23,960
So, so I..

189
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:27,080
I've got feelings for you.

190
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,160
Aha

191
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:45,520
Are you cool with the idea of continuing our relationship, I mean, like talking?

192
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:56,000
But if you're not, that's totally okay. I can handle my own feelings.

193
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,440
I don't want to cause you discomfort. I can hold back.

194
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:03,400
I wouldn't want to bother you or make things difficult.

195
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:15,200
Let's talk and get to know each other better.

196
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:21,120
If things click, we can see where it takes us, Sounds good?

197
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:23,240
Yes.

198
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:27,000
I'm going now.

199
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:30,720
Don't forget to take your medicine.

200
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:04,560
Any updates for today?

201
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:13,440
Well, things at KJ Agency aren't moving forward at all. I heard the first evaluation didn't go well.

202
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:20,840
I knew it. Araya alone is not that good.

203
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,360
Why are you so sure about it?

204
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:30,360
Mr. In, we were lovers.

205
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:35,160
Former lovers turned enemies are the most daunting.

206
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:38,200
Because we know each other too well.

207
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:42,520
Hello

208
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:47,560
Have you handled the matter I requested?

209
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:53,480
The process has already started, Boss, but it needs to be done gradually.

210
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:59,160
Great job! I'll leave it in your hands. And, most importantly, keep it under wraps, okay?

211
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:03,800
Roger that.

212
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,400
Oh my god!

213
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:17,640
What happened?

214
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:24,640
This is Kengkla, what could it be? It won't be anything but Mutelu? I'll bet a hundred.

215
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:27,080
I'll bet a thousand.

216
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,320
So what happened, Kengkla?

217
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:33,360
Tonight is a good night.

218
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:38,800
It's the new moon. It's the night of the full moon, the most powerful one

219
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:41,160
You can make a wish about anything, and it will come true.

220
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:52,640
You guys are not leaving early today. I'll take you to pray so that we can be super famous and no one can drag us down.

221
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,200
Good idea, right?

222
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:04,960
Can you walk faster? If you walk this slow, it won't be in time.

223
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:08,480
We're following. Why rush?

224
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:13,160
You're always so excited. Aren't you tired?

225
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:18,960
I mean well; I'm doing this for all of you. So we can pray to the moon for good fortune

226
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:22,680
for our beyond the star project to go big!

227
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,040
I'm starting.

228
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:44,560
Phupa, help me block the wind.

229
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:50,120
The wind is blowing this way.

230
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:51,280
The moonlight is out now

231
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:52,720
Hold on, hold on. It's going to be on time

232
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:56,960
Done. Come on

233
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,440
He looks more serious than when he practises.

234
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:16,840
Of course, he does.

235
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:20,200
I can hear what you're saying. Hands together.

236
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:35,160
Everyone, drink as much as you like tonight. It's a day off tomorrow!

237
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:42,760
But the last one who's sober will have to take care of the party aftermath.

238
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:47,120
Looks like it's going to be me.

239
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:49,560
Tonnam, are you alcohol-tolerant?

240
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:53,200
No, I don't drink.

241
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:54,200
Then you should go home.

242
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:55,680
What?

243
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:59,400
Just kidding.

244
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:06,040
It's okay, you don't have to drink. Just chilling with us.

245
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:09,440
If you're not drinking, fill up my cup.

246
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:11,800
Fill up mine too.

247
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:21,440
That bottle is not strong enough. Yes, that bottle.

248
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:29,360
Hurry up. Fill up mine. Wow, overflowing.

249
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:33,120
I'm going to feel the buzz.

250
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:43,120
Cheers? Come on.

251
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:46,320
Cheers!

252
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:55,560
Phupa, I think we should go home. I'm sleepy now.

253
00:25:55,560 --> 00:26:02,880
Look at Kengkla and Namo. They're both drunk; I don't think they'll be having any more drinks.

254
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:03,560
Okay

255
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:14,160
Namo, Namo, Namo. I'm going now.

256
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:15,800
I'm leaving.

257
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Yes? Oh, okay. Go home safely.

258
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:21,800
Bye Kengkla, bye Namo.

259
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:28,840
I'll carry it.

260
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:30,080
Thank you

261
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:45,440
Kengkla

262
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:53,280
Kengkla, go sleep on the bed properly.

263
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:11,720
Go sleep properly. Let me help.

264
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,640
Get up.

265
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:19,800
Quickly

266
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:23,680
Do you want to throw up?

267
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,800
Where are we going?

268
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:30,560
We're going to sleep.

269
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:35,400
Be careful.

270
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:03,920
Kengkla, don't touch.

271
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:12,240
What's going on?

272
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:24,120
What are you doing?

273
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:29,160
Can I kiss you?

274
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:35,600
Don't be funny.

275
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:39,360
What are you doing?

276
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:51,520
I have a good feeling for you.

277
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,800
But I'm confused.

278
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:07,000
Whether it's really love,

279
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:13,920
or just a strong bond.

280
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:28,600
Kengkla

281
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:33,080
I'm sorry.

282
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:37,960
It's okay, don't worry.

283
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:45,360
Our feelings

284
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:53,040
are the same anyway, right?

285
00:30:56,400 --> 00:31:03,760
No, it's not like that. It's just both of us are drunk.

286
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:09,440
If you don't like me

287
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:14,600
the way I like you,

288
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:22,320
why did we kiss, though?

289
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:36,960
It happened in the heat of the moment. Do you understand?

290
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:41,520
No

291
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:47,440
but I have to, right?

292
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:00,400
I'll take a shower.

293
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:05,720
You made me all sober now.

294
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:52,080
Hello, everyone!

295
00:32:55,040 --> 00:33:02,840
Welcome, everyone, to the press conference for the debut of the boy band Red King from MChange Entertainment.

296
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:12,840
Yes, first of all, please allow me to introduce our CEO. Please come up to the stage.

297
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:26,920
Hello to all honored guests, media, and fans

298
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:31,240
First of all, I want to express my gratitude to everyone who has joined this press conference.

299
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:38,240
Red King is our rookie group, and I aim for them to excel both in their image and dance.

300
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:44,600
The members include Film, Phark, Cream, Phat, Natee and Phuri.

301
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:50,520
Please give them love and support. Thank you.

302
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:55,960
Are you ready?

303
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:58,800
Are you ready?

304
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:06,240
If you're ready, please welcome Red King for their debut performance!

305
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:45,800
Kita, do you know that in our company, fighting is prohibited? It could lead to serious consequences, including termination.

306
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:47,320
Yes, I know.

307
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:50,200
How do you plan to take responsibility for this?

308
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:51,400
But he was the one who started the quarrel with me first.

309
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:52,880
You pissed me off first. / It was you..

310
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:53,520
Stop!

311
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:01,640
Kita, you punched him first.

312
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:08,760
Yes, I did. I'm sorry.

313
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:14,880
So, how do you want to be punished?

314
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:21,760
I've made a decision. To take responsibility for the incident,

315
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:24,560
I'd like to withdraw from the Red King project.

316
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,000
Hold a second.

317
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:27,760
What is it?

318
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:29,280
Why didn't you knock the door?

319
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:31,080
I'm sorry.

320
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:41,080
I understand that what Kita did was wrong, but please don't remove him from the project.

321
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:45,040
Then what do you want me to do? Remove you instead?

322
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:52,560
Is it possible for me to take on his punishment instead and swap positions?

323
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:56,800
Kawi

324
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:59,960
You don't have to do it this way.

325
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:02,560
I don't understand.

326
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:04,640
Give the copyright of the songs you wrote,

327
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:12,360
to the company and I'll pretend this never happened.

328
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:15,960
Mr. Kiat, he punched me.

329
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:28,520
I stand by my words. I will resign from being a teacher here.

330
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:32,160
Please don't.

331
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:37,200
I'm okay. Just doing the right thing.

332
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:48,640
I respect your decision, Kawi but Kita has to take his responsibility.

333
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:53,760
because it's going to be unfair to Film.

334
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:08,480
Kita, I'll remove you from the Red King project but you'll continue to be a trainee in our company.

335
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:11,920
Until we have a new project.

336
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:16,920
I want you to practise and improve yourself, understood?

337
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:19,880
Understood.
