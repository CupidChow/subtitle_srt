1
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:09,920
It is not a difficult dance. Why am I still unable to execute things properly?

2
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:15,240
I know, right? I have singing practice coming up. I am not sure I can handle it.

3
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:17,080
How long will you practice?

4
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:18,160
Until 5pm.

5
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:22,840
We will have a little talk outside

6
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:31,640
Thank you, bro.

7
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:36,640
Hey, are you okay?

8
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,640
Not really.

9
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,479
Mungkorn, where is Mawin

10
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:42,120
Is anything up?

11
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,759
Why does it have to be me every time you bring up his case?

12
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,880
He never shows up for practice.

13
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:49,880
We have yet to begin practising Teacher Kawee's assignment.

14
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:53,160
We cannot even begin practising Teacher Bee's one because of him.

15
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:55,680
What? again?

16
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:02,400
Calm down

17
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,000
Hold on

18
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,560
Go get him.

19
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,280
Why the fuck can't he pick up the phone?

20
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,600
Phupa, calm down a bit.

21
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:30,079
Don't worry, he'll come.

22
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,720
Shoot! I'll get scolded again.

23
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,760
Sorry, I'm late.

24
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,920
Now you show up.

25
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,600
Why the hell can't you pick up the phone?

26
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:16,680
Mungkorn, take it easy.

27
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:21,040
Control your temper.

28
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:26,680
Yes, speak nicely. You don't have to make a storm in a tea cup.

29
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:34,760
Why? Do you want to get away from your guilt? You promised not to come late. You're super irresponsible.

30
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:40,320
With this mindset? Do not even think of being in a boyband. You're dragging us down.

31
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:46,040
Mungkorn, chill out! control your rage!

32
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:57,000
Mawin's matter is better left to adults to handle. Not doing something like this.

33
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,640
Doing this will only have negative consequences. Especially to you.

34
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:10,240
What are you guys doing?

35
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:16,000
You are aware that this room is monitored by CCTV, aren't you?

36
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:24,640
Mungkorn and Mawin, Araya wants to meet you.

37
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:37,159
Continue practising.

38
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:50,200
Hello

39
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:55,040
You know why you're being called, don't you?

40
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,520
We do.

41
00:04:56,520 --> 00:05:00,600
Fighting is another prohibited behaviour.

42
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:07,240
Whatever happened, tell Pim. The company will find a solution to the situation.

43
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:11,080
Do not make judgments based on your feelings. It is not beneficial and will only have negative consequences.

44
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,320
I'm sorry.

45
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:32,120
In Mawin's case, I am aware of your situation, but if you choose this path in life, you must also be able to handle it effectively.

46
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:36,080
I get it. I'm sorry.

47
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:41,800
I won't let this kind of situation happen again. I am going to work on myself.

48
00:05:43,159 --> 00:05:48,040
Words are not as powerful as actions. I will keep an eye on everyone.

49
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:56,960
This must not happen again. Otherwise, the two of you will be dropped from the project. Got it?

50
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,240
We got it.

51
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:08,200
Hey

52
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:15,120
I'm sorry.

53
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,200
I was impulsive just now.

54
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,400
Um

55
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:29,400
I just do not like the fact that you cannot manage your time. You act as if practising is not important.

56
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:37,360
It's not the way you thought. But I have a duty to take responsibility for.

57
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:42,920
A duty? Is there anything more important than practising?

58
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:48,240
Is it really that important? No need to make excuses.

59
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:53,480
I didn't make excuses. I have to work part-time.

60
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:56,800
In order to support myself and my family

61
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:03,120
I am determined, and I have worked hard to make the most of my time.

62
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:08,120
I say this not because I want your sympathy.

63
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:16,240
I just want you to know that I'm doing my best.

64
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:26,400
Do you realise how exhausted I am? I need to practice while also working. What else do you expect from me?

65
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:32,480
I didn't mean to..

66
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:42,400
Unlike you, I have had no familial support from birth. I will not be able to make ends meet if I do not work.

67
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:45,920
I'm really sorry.

68
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:53,480
Never mind. I'm sorry, too.

69
00:07:55,600 --> 00:08:03,880
I only make trouble wherever I go. I simply want you to know that I am doing my absolute best.

70
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:15,560
Being part of this project is my only hope and my sole chance to brighten up my future.

71
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:19,320
Do you understand me?

72
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:58,280
Thank you. I'll pay by cards. Hello, Phu.

73
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,560
Hi, hand me your bag. I'll carry it.

74
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:00,720
Thank you.

75
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,840
Slowly

76
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:07,840
Alright

77
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,760
Are you alright?

78
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,840
I am.

79
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:27,760
How's everything going, guys?
/Hello

80
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:30,360
Are you ready for today's class?
/ Yes!

81
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:37,120
Teacher, Tonnam has a sprained leg, so he probably won't be able to dance.

82
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:46,680
Accidents, I understand, are unavoidable.

83
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:51,000
But we can be careful to prevent it from happening.

84
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:59,840
I would like to offer some criticism. Why don't you realise you should be cautious?

85
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:05,720
Because it will be a burden on your friends

86
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:12,160
I'm sorry.

87
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:18,320
It's okay; it has happened, and there's nothing you can do to change it now.

88
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:23,680
Okay, Tonnam. You can take a break and review the dance for today.

89
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:34,760
Let's continue, the rest of you. Okay, come on.

90
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:41,240
Review from the basics first. Can you still remember?

91
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:49,240
Starting from bouncing. 5 6 7 8 Go! 1 2 3..

92
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:58,120
Hold on. Try again. You guys already forgot. 5 6 7 8 Go! 1 2..

93
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:00,160
Why are you here?

94
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,240
What's wrong?

95
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:17,880
Nothing, I'm just thinking about this and that.

96
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:24,560
If there's anything uncomfortable, please let me know.

97
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:34,200
I miss mom and dad.

98
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,920
Call then if you miss them.

99
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:57,440
I can't call them now; they passed away last month.

100
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,720
I'm sorry.

101
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:16,840
Life is funny sometimes, don't you think so?
It's like..

102
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:26,480
I tried so hard just to be here. I wanted them to be proud of me. But, you see, they're not here anymore.

103
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:29,880
Now, I don't know what I'm trying so hard for.

104
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:46,320
Another thing, I feel like I no longer belong here.

105
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,960
What makes you think that way?

106
00:13:54,840 --> 00:14:00,200
Look at me. I'm not good at dancing.

107
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:09,440
And I hurt my leg. I feel like a burden.

108
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:25,320
I believe in you. You the best in my eyes.

109
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:29,520
The accident is not a big deal.

110
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:37,000
It's okay. I've got your back.

111
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:47,320
Really?

112
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:51,840
Really. Why would I lie to you?

113
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:56,080
I'm sure you can do it.

114
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,160
Okay

115
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,800
Oh? Pim, aren't you leaving yet?

116
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:27,520
I'm about to leave.

117
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:29,040
I'm leaving. Bye.

118
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:33,400
Anyway, I'd appreciate it if you could take care of the boys too. Consider yourself a senior. If there's anything, please help advise and teach them."

119
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:38,640
Consider yourself a senior. If there's anything, please help advise and teach them.

120
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:40,040
Copy that.

121
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:42,720
Wait!

122
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:43,960
Yes?

123
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:50,560
Keep it friendly with a senior and junior vibe; no need to flirt with everyone, okay?

124
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:55,920
I'd rather not keep solving your problems, so let's try to avoid creating more, okay?

125
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:59,760
I'll try, but I won't promise

126
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:02,120
Huh? You're gonna get it!

127
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:03,600
Today is the first testing day. Please make a lot of comments.

128
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,839
So they'll know where to improve and can do it right away.

129
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:08,040
Alright

130
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:14,480
Pim, please take notes on the boys' progress so that we can make improvements in the future.

131
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:15,839
Roger that.

132
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:20,720
For mr.Kong, please take a close look at the boys and determine the best way to adjust their appearance.

133
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:25,040
Or you can watch their show first, so you'll know how to groom them best.

134
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:31,080
Noted! I guarantee our costumes are going to be the best ever.

135
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:36,720
I'm counting on all of you. Let's talk again after the test.

136
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:52,120
Are you guys ready?

137
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:58,280
Hello

138
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:11,800
How's everything going? Are you nervous?

139
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:18,920
For the first evaluation, do your best.

140
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:25,280
I believe everyone is well prepared. So, let's don't waste time.

141
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:37,040
I know everyone is determined, but, to be honest, I'm a bit disappointed

142
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:42,000
I expected something better than this but it's alright.

143
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:50,560
For dancing, Kengkla did the best today but could be better.

144
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:55,720
As for others, you may not yet have the right direction in mind

145
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:59,880
But It's okay. It's a chance for improvement.

146
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:06,120
We might have to practise more basics. I'll talk about it later in class.

147
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:15,000
For singing, you guys need to practise more. Because your singing is still not good yet.

148
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:22,960
For those still out of tune, my advice is to listen more.

149
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:31,720
I like Tul and Trin's singing the most. Don't forget to practise more.

150
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:36,560
The teachers covered everything on point.

151
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:41,120
I quite agreed. From now on, you guys should train harder.

152
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:44,720
I hope to see improvements from everybody next time.

153
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:53,280
Let me be honest, if things don't go well, I might reconsider the project. I don't want to waste money.

154
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:57,320
I want to work with people who give their 100% in their work.

155
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:03,480
Go back and practise. I'm rooting for you all.

156
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:07,600
Thank you for today. See you next time.

157
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:18,280
Thank you

158
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:38,440
Before leaving, everyone goes to Mr. Kong to have your body measurements taken. He'll be in charge of your appearance.

159
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:46,840
How pathetic you all look. Let's take the measurements. Come one! so you can take a rest.

160
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:52,800
Hold it. Help me out. Hurry up boys. Don't you want to go home? Or do you want to stay here with me?

161
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:53,920
Chest..

162
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:09,800
Namo! Namo! Why are you here alone?

163
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:12,600
I'm listening to music and thinking about stuff.

164
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:14,920
Can I listen with you?

165
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:26,000
What song are you listening to?

166
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,120
This one

167
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:19,960
Listening to this song brings up old memories.

168
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:25,160
Do you still remember?

169
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:29,680
How can I forget? Isn't it the one you wrote?

170
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:34,320
Yes, it is.

171
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:38,520
How about singing it again?

172
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:41,440
Good idea

173
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:43,120
But you play the guitar

174
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:45,320
I should, It's my song.

175
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:47,320
Of course.

176
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:51,920
Wait, let me look at the chords first.

177
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:54,840
What? It's your own song. How could you forget the chords?

178
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:57,040
I didn't play it for a while.

179
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:57,840
Alright, alright.

180
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:00,920
I'll hold it for you.

181
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:07,840
Alright, 5 4 3 2 1

182
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:00,480
We have this many members in today's class, right?

183
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:03,880
Yes, that's right.

184
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:08,880
Has anyone done the 'reflection assignment'?

185
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,400
We haven't

186
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:14,920
It's okay. We'll do it together

187
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:22,240
'Reflection assignment', just like its name. The mirror will reflect everything we do.

188
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:28,280
We'll split into two teams. One team is the leader and another team is the follower.

189
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:33,280
Whatever the leader does, the follower has to follow.

190
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:40,400
The most important thing to keep in mind is that the leader must not do anything that can cause harm to the follower.

191
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:46,280
Don't forget to take care of your friends. If you understand, you can pair up now.

192
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:52,640
Phupa pairs up with Tonnam and Namo with Kengkla. Let's start.

193
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:55,920
Be focused. And start when you're ready.

194
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:57,280
Who's gonna be the leader?

195
00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:01,960
Okay, Phupa and Kengklas are the leader.

196
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:21,480
You reflect each other.

197
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:29,920
Keep an eye contact. Be focused. Move closer a bit.

198
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:12,000
That was great, everyone.

199
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,960
Now, switch partners.

200
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:18,920
Bring Tonnam here?
/I'll go there

201
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:23,480
Walk properly and stay here.

202
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:34,360
This time Namo and Tonnam are gonna be the leader.
/ I'll lead.

203
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:41,920
Okay, look at your friends slowly.

204
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:51,200
Keep and eye contact and be focused. Don't forget you're reflecting each other.

205
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:07,920
Tonnam, be concentrated.

206
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:19,000
I learned about concentration and focus today.

207
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:24,360
You learned a lot today. Don't forget to do your homework.

208
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:27,960
And that's it for today.

209
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:36,640
I'll leave. / Take me with you. / No!

210
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:38,000
Phupa

211
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:39,920
hm?

212
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,200
Nothing

213
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:47,560
I'll pack your stuff for you.

214
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:18,480
Is something good? You were walking around with a smile.

215
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,000
I have something to boast about.

216
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,440
hm? what is it?

217
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:26,120
What is this?

218
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:31,880
It's the video of Namo and Kengkla playing guitar and singing together. The views on the video have surpassed 100,000.

219
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,480
People are shipping Kengkla and Namo.

220
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:45,400
At first, I thought I would just post a video, but the response has been surprisingly good.

221
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:52,720
People are starting to ask about their work and talking about the 'Beyond the Star' project.

222
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,000
Good, then.

223
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:58,480
They're talking a lot about Namo and Kengkla.

224
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,480
You did a great job.

225
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:09,520
Um, but if they sue you, you'll be responsible. It has nothing to do with me.

226
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:17,520
You secretly took a video of them and even posted it on social media without their permission. If they're not okay with it, I won't be able to help you."

227
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:28,160
Are we going to abandon each other so easily? I'm trying to help create a trend, and the company also benefits

228
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:33,280
Also, the boys benefit from it. I don't think they would sue me.

229
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:38,320
Who knows? I don't know.

230
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:39,760
Boss!

231
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:43,560
I don't know.

232
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:46,040
Don't know. Don't know. Don't know.

233
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:05,880
Kengkla, I want to sleep.

234
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:18,080
Kengkla!

235
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:29,560
Why are you praying so early in the morning? Don't you think Buddha also wants to sleep like me?

236
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:33,880
Namo, be quiet.

237
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:41,400
I'm praying so that our project will be amazing. Got it?

238
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:49,600
Wake up.

239
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:57,880
Wake up. You'll be late.

240
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:09,240
If you don't get up, you'll go to practise late.

241
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:13,920
But I don't want to get up.

242
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:16,520
Stubborn

243
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:20,120
I'm not stubborn.

244
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:23,560
Do you know what will stubborn kid get?

245
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:33,400
A morning kiss

246
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:40,000
I was waiting for this.

247
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
Then go take a shower, or we'll be late.

248
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:48,480
I'll take a shower later.

249
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:17,440
What do you think?

250
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:19,640
They're getting better everyday.

251
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:24,720
Seeing this makes me a little relieved. I think we should start preparing for their debut.

252
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:26,960
Sounds like a lot of fun.

253
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:33,680
I know, right? Let's see, between MChange and KJ, who's going to win this game?

254
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:41,880
Say the prayers together.

255
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:56,360
Namo, wake up.

256
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:58,120
I'm sleepy.

257
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:03,440
I know but say the prayers first.

258
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:05,440
The monk is saying it, though.

259
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:16,200
Looks yummy. I'll have two. Oh! I don't need a plastic bag, thank you.

260
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:22,880
Are you Namo?

261
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:37,560
Kita! How are you? I missed you so much!

262
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:39,640
How are you? Haven't seen you for a long time.

263
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:41,720
I'm good, what about you?

264
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:45,040
I'm good, the usual, you know?

265
00:36:52,520 --> 00:37:01,600
Um, I was a little bit too happy. I forgot to introduce him. This is Kita. Do you remember? I've told you about him during our time in University.

266
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:04,120
Hello

267
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:07,840
Hi

268
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:14,600
And this is Kengkla, my friend from the agency. He's also my roommate.

269
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:20,680
Is Kengkla your best friend from university?

270
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:22,240
Yes, I am

271
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:25,120
We haven't met since then, have we?

272
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:27,120
We haven't.

273
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:31,160
I try texting you but you don't even read.

274
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:34,560
That was when we just broke up. Who would dare to read?

275
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:41,960
I thought it was something else. Why did you choose to break up with me then?

276
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:47,600
Namo, didn't you say you were hungry? Let's go get some food.

277
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:52,480
Oh right? Let's have a meal together since we haven't met for so long.

278
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:55,440
Are you hungry? So we can talk.
