1
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:28,160
Is something wrong?

2
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:36,880
I'm stressed out. I can't help but worry after seeing Red King debut.

3
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:44,840
Our boys are not making much progress. Their boys are so well-prepared. I don't know if we can compete with them.

4
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:49,720
Araya, don't worry. You must believe in the potential of our company.

5
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:57,120
You should also have faith in our boys. They are giving their all. I see it firsthand.

6
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:58,960
Don't throw in the towel just yet

7
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,160
Thank you, Kong.

8
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:13,160
I just hope it turns out well. Otherwise, we might be in a bit of a bind this time.

9
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,040
What?

10
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,000
I didn't see that coming.

11
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,200
Make a wish.

12
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,360
Hurry up, before the candle goes out!

13
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,480
Oh, this is too close.

14
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:28,800
I'm kidding.

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I wish you all the happiness. Happy Birthday.

16
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,600
Other than cake, I have one more present.

17
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,000
Hold a second.

18
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,880
Where is the present?

19
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:52,360
Just a moment, don't rush me.

20
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:56,720
Wait, where is it? Is it here?

21
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:03,040
You're so cheesy.

22
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,120
This is cute!

23
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:39,680
This is your birthday present from me.

24
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,120
Why?

25
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:06,920
Why did you slap me?

26
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:07,680
Does it hurt?

27
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,680
Of course, it does! Damn you!

28
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:10,840
You slapped me.

29
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:15,880
If it hurts, then this is real?

30
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,760
What are you talking about?

31
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,280
Try slap me.

32
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,480
What?

33
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:27,160
Slap me.

34
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,760
For real?

35
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:29,840
Yes, just slap me.

36
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:35,760
Oh, it really hurts.

37
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:46,840
Namo

38
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,520
Namo, wake up.

39
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,120
Namo! Wake up!

40
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:11,840
I want to sleep. Why are you waking me up?

41
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,840
I'm sleepy. Just let me sleep.

42
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,360
Namo, wake up now! It's your birthday today!

43
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:26,200
If it's my birthday, then let me sleep. Why did you wake me up?

44
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:30,200
It's your birthday, you have to pray and make merit to create positive karma for yourself! Get up!

45
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:32,320
No, I don't want to get up.

46
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,960
Wake up and come with me.

47
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:45,600
Namo, go to the temple with me. Get up, now.

48
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:53,880
Oh, you're so heavy. Hurry up! Quickly! Get up. Pray with me!

49
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,800
How does making merit on your birthday feel?

50
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,640
It feels

51
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:16,120
sleepy

52
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:18,400
But your name is Namo?

53
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,480
I'm sleepy.

54
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,640
Hello

55
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,000
Happy Birthday!

56
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,600
Do you still remember my birthday?

57
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:36,280
Certainly! May happiness always find its way to you.

58
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:39,799
Thank you so much.

59
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:42,799
Do you have plans for today?

60
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:44,480
Why are you asking?

61
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Let's have a meal together.

62
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:50,000
Um, sounds good.

63
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,800
Okay, I'll let you know where we can eat later.

64
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:58,200
Okay, see you. Bye.

65
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,200
Who was it?

66
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:06,120
Kita called to wish me a happy birthday and suggested grabbing a meal together.

67
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:12,400
Okay, so, I think, I'll put this back.

68
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:22,160
Kengkla, why are you taking me here? There are many clothes on the trees.

69
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:25,320
There are many other paths to walk.

70
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:26,680
Isn't it normal?

71
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:28,160
No, it's not.

72
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,200
It's not?

73
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,320
Boys, stay still.

74
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:38,480
Did you know that both of you were cursed?

75
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,240
Let's have a talk. Take a seat.

76
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,360
Why are you hesitating? Come on.

77
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,000
What's wrong with her?

78
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:48,160
I don't know.

79
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,480
Let's go.

80
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,720
You're so trusting.

81
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:53,680
Quicly sit down.

82
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,360
Take a seat.

83
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:01,800
Your horoscopes are compatible and support each other,

84
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:06,360
but it appears that a romantic connection may not be in the cards for you both. Do you know why?

85
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:12,520
Because in your past lives, it seems you guys have been deprived of love.

86
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:19,560
You were cursed because you two ran away, and your parents were very angry

87
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:22,080
That's why you were cursed!

88
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,320
Nonsense. You're quite the storyteller, aren't you?

89
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:28,160
Let's go. It's too hot here.

90
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:32,960
Wait, don't go. I'm not done talking yet. I still have more to tell.

91
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,960
Take a seat.

92
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:45,040
If the fortunes of the two children are separated, whatever you do may not be successful.

93
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:51,760
Considering all your horoscopes, it appears that you need to be together for prosperity!

94
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:04,920
What?

95
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:08,680
See? If you don't believe me, don't be disrespectful

96
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:11,080
Have you lost your mind? That was nonsense.

97
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:17,760
Whether people love each other or not is a matter between two individuals. It's not the result of a curse from a past life, as she said.

98
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,480
You tend to believe in nonsense.

99
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,480
Namo, wait for me!

100
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:34,400
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven..

101
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:47,520
Oh, Poom, when did you come?

102
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:48,960
Just now.

103
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
What's up?

104
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:55,160
I'm frustrated with myself. I still can't dance well.

105
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:59,560
You can do it. Don't put too much pressure on yourself.

106
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:06,320
I want to dance well like the others.

107
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:09,280
No one is born talented.

108
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:12,280
Everyone becomes better through their own efforts.

109
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:16,840
But effort doesn't guarantee success for everyone.

110
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:23,200
Ever heard the saying that effort never hurt anyone?

111
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:29,720
These are clearly the words of a successful person.

112
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:44,000
Let's just say that from now on, if you're uncomfortable, tired or discouraged, just turn this way.

113
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:50,080
I'm always here just like how mountains and headwaters must be together.

114
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:54,320
I don't understand.

115
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:02,880
Phupha means mountains and Tonnam means head waters. If there's mountains, there's headwaters.

116
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:08,680
So, where there are Tonnam, there will be Phupha, right?

117
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:32,600
5 6 7 8 Go 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8

118
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:35,080
Hello, please come in.

119
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:43,240
Hello everyone, today we have guests visiting the company.

120
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:50,000
Why are Mungkorn and Mawin not present?

121
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,520
Mungkorn and Mawin are currently occupied with other commitments.

122
00:13:54,560 --> 00:14:00,480
Okay, everyone, I'd like to introduce Lee and Diya.

123
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:05,160
They will be our partners for the Beyond the Star project.

124
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:06,720
Hello

125
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:12,280
It's a pleasure to meet you all. I hope we will have the opportunity to collaborate.

126
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:16,680
My name is Diya. We may have the opportunity to interact more in the future.

127
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:18,680
If you have any questions or concerns, feel free to come and consult with me.

128
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:21,680
I'm rooting for you all.

129
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:27,080
Starting from now, both of them will also be attending your showcase.

130
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:31,320
They will also be evaluating your performance.

131
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:36,720
I think we should let them continue their practice to make the most of their time.

132
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:41,320
Prim, please accompany Lee and Diya for a tour of our company.

133
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:43,320
Understood, Miss.

134
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:58,440
Following this, the training will become more intense, everyone.

135
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:02,000
Everyone is aware that this is business, correct?

136
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:08,000
Since everything is considered an investment, whenever the company invests in something, we aim for the best outcome.

137
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:14,520
From now on, only the resilient will weather the storm

138
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:19,960
Focus on practising to the utmost, so you won't regret it later.

139
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:24,800
Alright! Let's practise!

140
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:35,240
Okay, ready? 5 6 7 8 Go 1 2 3 4

141
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:44,280
Stop!

142
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:47,520
Cream, turn off the music.

143
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:50,680
Natee, what the hell is happening with your dancing?

144
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:55,080
We've been practising this for quite a while now. Have you ever practised at home?

145
00:15:56,600 --> 00:16:00,600
I'm sorry, but I did practise.

146
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:03,520
Stop talking nonsense.

147
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:11,320
If you claimed to have practiced, we should have seen some improvement.

148
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:18,280
I don't get it. You keep making the same mistake over and over again.

149
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:23,160
You know what? It's frustrating.

150
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:28,680
Take it easy. Let's cool off and talk first.

151
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:32,480
That's right. He'll get better if we continue practising.

152
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:41,480
Okay, we'll take a 30-minute break and practise after that. How does that sound?

153
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:45,280
Really? Perfect! I'm feeling hungry.

154
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:50,960
Cut it out. Have a look around. We're all pretty serious here.

155
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:58,320
Is it okay?

156
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:01,320
Take a rest.

157
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,280
You're doing well.

158
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:08,160
You gave it your all. It's okay. Let's go

159
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:12,880
To be honest with you, I'm hungry too.

160
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:17,079
I didn't dare tell anyone because I didn't want to be scolded.

161
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:23,520
I want to thank you so much, my friend, for taking the scolding in my place.

162
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:28,280
Cream! Come back, I think we need to talk.

163
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:41,240
Until now, I still can't differentiate between you and your brother. You look exactly the same.

164
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:42,840
You can look at our faces.

165
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:44,480
But how?

166
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,160
I look younger

167
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,800
and cuter.

168
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:52,480
I always thought you are the older one.

169
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,480
Copper!

170
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,520
I'll be back.

171
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:20,720
Tul, wait for me.

172
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:23,240
Hey, I was hoping we could have a chat.

173
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:26,360
About what?

174
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:28,680
I know you have something to say. You can say it.

175
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,200
Do you have a crush on Copper?

176
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:37,120
No, I don't.

177
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:45,840
You seem really close to him, like unusually close. Why is that?

178
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:50,880
There's nothing between us. Don't worry.

179
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:57,120
I want to make sure you know that I've liked Copper from the very start.

180
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:58,920
I know.

181
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:05,200
But there's no need to worry. We made a promise, right? That we wouldn't quarrel about boys again

182
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,560
We're just friends.

183
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,320
Is yours yummy?

184
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,200
Yup, you want one?

185
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:35,840
No, thanks.

186
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:43,880
Namo, what are you watching? Why aren't you eating?

187
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:47,560
I'm watching Red King's dance performance. They're damn good.

188
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,520
I want to be like them.

189
00:19:56,280 --> 00:20:01,240
They are amazing, indeed. This is our toughest rival.

190
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:03,240
We have to beat them, no matter what.

191
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:10,200
I feel discouraged now. How can we beat them?

192
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:13,800
Phupha, we have to believe in ourselves.

193
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:17,240
Nothing is beyond our reach with the right effort

194
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,080
Is this okay?

195
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,360
What are you watching?

196
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,440
Let me see.

197
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:58,120
Who was the one who said "If we put our effort, we can beat them!"?

198
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,680
Now you're sitting here looking all pathetic.

199
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:11,960
I don't want everyone to be stressed out; it will only make things worse.

200
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:16,560
I'm stressed to the moon and back.

201
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:19,480
Hey! Come here.

202
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:22,600
I'll help you relieve stress.

203
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:25,560
How?

204
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:28,200
Just come and relax on my lap.

205
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:36,240
You're stressed? You don't have to be stressed.

206
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:37,760
Can we really beat them?

207
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:43,120
I'm not sure. How am I doing with the massage?

208
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:45,680
Um, you're quite good at massaging.

209
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,760
Are you alright?

210
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:23,440
I am.

211
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:32,840
Are you upset with me?

212
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,720
No, I'm not.

213
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:40,840
If I've upset you, please let me know.

214
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:43,880
No, you haven't.

215
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:48,960
Today, I made a lot of mistakes during dance practice.

216
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:55,560
Film scolded me a little, so I'm not feeling well, and I can't catch up with the dance.

217
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:02,160
Despite being the nephew of the company owner, I can't do anything at all.

218
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:18,720
You'll be fine. If you can't do it today, you'll be able to in the future.

219
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:28,600
Don't be disheartened. If you can't do it yet, keep trying to catch up.

220
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:32,040
Opportunity doesn't knock twice.

221
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:39,440
I'm not disheartened. I'm just tired.

222
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:50,000
I've got your back. Opportunities like this don't come easily to anyone.

223
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:56,880
I want you to keep the momentum going.I don't want you to experience what I went through.

224
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:03,120
I promise, I won't give up. I'll also fight for your dream.

225
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:35,720
Is there anything on your mind, baby?

226
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:36,840
Nothing.

227
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:48,920
Are you sure?

228
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,520
Yes, I'm sure.

229
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,600
I just want to try being clingy.

230
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:03,920
Did you do something wrong? Naughty boy.

231
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:05,920
I'm not a naughty boy.

232
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:13,600
I have a little present for you.

233
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:18,240
Oh, this is a sea salt caramel truffle.

234
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:22,320
How did you know this is exactly what I was craving?

235
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:27,040
I noticed you bought it before, so I immediately knew it's something you like.

236
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:36,720
You nagged a lot last time we went to buy it, but it was out of stock. I suggested another brand, but you refused.

237
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,080
You know what?

238
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:44,480
You are..

239
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:47,320
the cutest.

240
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,280
I want to eat it right away.

241
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,200
Are you satisfied now?

242
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:16,920
You are always by my side on my bad days,

243
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:19,520
,and I appreciate that

244
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:30,000
So, how was today? Are you tired? Let me give you a massage.

245
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:32,720
I feel like I do need a massage.

246
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:33,760
Which part hurts the most?

247
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:41,360
Right here and here and also there and there.

248
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:42,560
And also right there.

249
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,160
I don't know where to start.

250
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:49,520
Um, maybe right here?

251
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:55,480
right here?

252
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:01,960
Or right here?

253
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:03,520
Babe.

254
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:10,200
I think you better give me a massage here.

255
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:11,720
Are you sure?

256
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:15,920
Yes, starting from here. And right there, we can save it for later.

257
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:22,960
Who massages with shirts on, anyway?

258
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:27,160
Do you want me to take it off?

259
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:31,720
Let me take it off for you.

260
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:37,640
Why do you keep staring?

261
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:39,480
I can't hold it anymore.

262
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:45,280
Hold what?

263
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:48,560
You're truly the naughty one.

264
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:52,480
I'm only naughty for you.

265
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:57,440
But you know what the punishment is for being naughty, right?

266
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:01,680
No, I don't. But I want to know.

267
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:33,720
How do you see our project shaping up in the future?

268
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:41,640
Right now, I don't see the light at the end of the tunnel.

269
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:48,040
What made you think so?

270
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:58,040
None of us in the project are making progress, myself included.

271
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:10,120
We're not doing well yet. After watching Red King,

272
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:13,640
it seems like we're quite far behind them

273
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:17,000
You've got a point.

274
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:25,760
I think if we try practising harder, we can definitely beat them.

275
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:26,920
We can.

276
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:31,840
I've prayed this much, it has to be successful

277
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:36,680
It's you and your superstitions again, huh?

278
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:39,440
It always works, though.

279
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:47,000
I pray every day because I want our team to succeed.

280
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:56,440
Why not turn the time you spend in prayer into dedicated practice?

281
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:59,680
It's like you're wasting your time.

282
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:06,120
Instead of doing nonsense, how about spending that time on practice to improve yourself? It'll be much better.

283
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:44,000
Kengkla

284
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:49,000
Kengkla

285
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:54,120
Where did he go this early in the morning?

286
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:05,040
What's going on with him again?

287
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,880
Hello, Namo

288
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:22,280
Hi

289
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:24,680
What are you doing here? Don't you go upstairs?

290
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:28,040
I'm here to take a call from my family. I'll head up soon.

291
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:29,240
Okay, see you.

292
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,640
Kengkla, where have you been?

293
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:56,120
Is he angry because of that matter?

294
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:11,360
Let's start from this move. 1  2  3  4
Leg 5  6  7  8 Punch 1  2  3  4 Up 5  6  7 8

295
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:29,600
1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  1  2  3  4
3  5  6  7  8 Punch 1  2  3  4  5  3  6  7 8

296
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:37,480
Stop. Namo, focus. What's wrong with you today? You're always distracted. Please pay attention.

297
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:39,040
I'm sorry.

298
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:45,040
Okay, let's start from the beginning. 5 6 7 8..

299
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:03,360
Which one are you interested in?

300
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:08,520
Just by looking at designs, I found the one I like. But I have to listen to the quality of the sound first.

301
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:13,280
Isn't the sound quality dependent on the headphones?

302
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:16,760
It's actually up to your feeling when you listen to it.

303
00:34:18,199 --> 00:34:20,639
Can I try listening?

304
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:21,760
Sure

305
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:32,960
Babe! This is the rare one. The limited edition.

306
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:35,960
Oh, yes. My father put all his effort into this album.

307
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:38,960
My father put all his effort into this album.

308
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:43,040
And it's the album my father is most proud of.

309
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:50,360
If I want to purchase this tape along with the player, will it be expensive?

310
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:53,960
If you want it, just pay the cost price.

311
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:55,120
Really?

312
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:56,679
Thank you so much!

313
00:34:56,880 --> 00:35:00,000
Hey, babe, guess what? It's a bit steep online.

314
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:06,000
Try listening to it first.

315
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:13,560
His son is taking you to buy it. Take good care of it, young man. It's hard to find now.

316
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:14,760
Thank you!

317
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:40,440
I've prayed this much, it has to be successful

318
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:42,600
It's you and your superstitions again, huh?

319
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:48,200
Instead of doing nonsense, how about spending that time on practice to improve yourself? It'll be much better.

320
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:17,480
Hello, what are you doing? Are you free by any chance?

321
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:20,400
Yes, I am. What's up?

322
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:27,080
I'm thinking about going on busking.

323
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:30,160
So, I called to invite you to accompany me.

324
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:33,600
Why me? Where is Kengkla?

325
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:38,160
He's angry with me, actually.

326
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:47,320
Please come with me. It's a bit embarrassing to go alone.

327
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:52,440
Okay, okay. Send me the location.

328
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,040
Okay

329
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:56,600
See you.

330
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:33,320
No

331
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:53,960
Thank you ver much!

332
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:55,600
Can I take a picture with you?

333
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:56,360
Sure

334
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:06,240
Thank you

335
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:10,000
Thank you a lot.

336
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:18,800
Mr. Kiat. Hello.

337
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:24,160
You are also here?

338
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,120
Yes.

339
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:29,760
I didn't realise that you were here.

340
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:35,040
I just arrived and noticed a lot of people gathering, so I wanted to take a look.

341
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:50,000
You have a fantastic voice. I believe I can help you achieve big things.

342
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:54,880
It seems like you don't belong to KJ Agency. You should consider joining my company

343
00:39:54,880 --> 00:40:00,040
I am confident that I can make you famous.

344
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:07,400
I need some time to consider this matter
