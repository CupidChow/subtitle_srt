1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,480
The case battle between

2
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:11,840
Red King and Beyond the star has ended

3
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,400
and the winner team is

4
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:22,000
The first place

5
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:24,760
goes to

6
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:48,800
KJ's promised project has remained silent.

7
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,000
So what?

8
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:54,800
I don't see any signs of progress.

9
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:59,880
Oh, or it will fail.

10
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Isn't that none of your business?

11
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,400
I see you brag a lot, claiming it must be amazing, must be great.

12
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:14,960
So far I haven't seen anything.

13
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:20,640
Should something like this be kept private?

14
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,800
Like our story?

15
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:31,960
Our story came to an end a long time ago. Why have you not stopped talking about it?

16
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:36,520
Or are you that drawn to me?

17
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,560
Anyway, I hope your project can compete with MChange's.

18
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:55,160
But if there's any sign that you won't make it, let me know. I could help with money.

19
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,080
Let's wait and see.

20
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:10,760
One day, members of Beyond the Stars and KJ Agency will be number one instead of MChange.

21
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,600
Hello, how are you?

22
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,280
Hey, he's here.

23
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,320
Hello, everybody.

24
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:44,120
Hello

25
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:47,360
The president has now arrived. Prepare yourself.

26
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,560
Okay

27
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:33,800
Hello, welcome to Beyond The Star project.

28
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:38,280
A project that will lead everyone to the forefront of the industry.

29
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:49,320
Everyone must focus on training and doing their jobs to the best of their abilities in order to grow themselves to be better in every aspect.

30
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:56,240
I hope everyone gives it their all.

31
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:02,720
And besides everyone standing here
I would like to introduce one more person.

32
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:08,800
He is your agency's senior, and he will also be part of this project.

33
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,280
Please introduce yourself to your friends.

34
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:14,320
Hello

35
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,360
Hello

36
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:20,120
I'm copper. Nice to meet you all.

37
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:30,560
Other than practising, there aren't many restrictions here. Practise, practise, practise.

38
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:35,200
I'm sorry, but isn't love prohibited?

39
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:43,520
Actually, this is considered your personal matter, and the company is unlikely to intervene.

40
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:50,400
But you should be able to consider what you should and should not do.

41
00:06:56,080 --> 00:07:03,160
Do your best, and I'll keep an eye on you all. You're not going to let me down, are you?

42
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,720
No, we won't

43
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,800
Hello, everyone

44
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,480
Hello

45
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:26,360
My name is Kawee. Today's our first meeting.

46
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:32,000
I will first request a quick evaluation of each student's skills.

47
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:34,840
Reay?

48
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,240
ready

49
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:28,200
Thank you so much to everyone. After that, let's try to practise as much as possible.

50
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:33,600
We will regularly run tests to evaluate each individual's ability level.

51
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:39,039
Anyone who has not made progress may be unable to continue with your friends.

52
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,559
Keep fighting everyone.

53
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:44,960
Yes

54
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,800
I'm freaking sleepy.

55
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:56,400
Same here. You should not have invited me out to drink last night.

56
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:03,840
How could you blame me?  Well, you came along. Everyone else was at home.

57
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,880
Oh my goodness, now you're blaming me.

58
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:10,840
Is the teacher coming in today, guys?

59
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,080
I guess not.

60
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:19,400
Look, there's a message instructing us to practise and record a clip.

61
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:23,400
Oh, right, I forgot to check.

62
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:34,560
What happened?

63
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,120
Thanks a lot

64
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,600
Drink now.

65
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,120
Is he the only person in the room?

66
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:56,800
Well, there's only one bottle left. What do you want me to do? huh?

67
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,240
Nothing

68
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,560
I was just curious.

69
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,400
Buy one if you want to drink.

70
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:16,000
I gotta go.

71
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Fighting

72
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,840
Deeya, what brings you here today?

73
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:36,960
I came by for a brief visit.
I'm afraid you'll think this partner has no involvement at all.

74
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:42,040
Who would dare to think such a thing?
Where's In?

75
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,480
In is coming.

76
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:45,760
So you have any news to share?

77
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,680
Was it that obvious?

78
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:52,880
People like you will not want to come here if there is no news to share.

79
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:57,440
In told me to come over and update the story from that side.

80
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:01,160
They have started. What about us?

81
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:10,880
I'll leave you to keep an eye on them, Deeya.

82
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,040
Copy that.

83
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:29,200
How are the boys here?

84
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:35,600
They're not bad. From what I know, they're probably even better than that side.

85
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,360
Feel better now?

86
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:50,000
Seeing them gives me a sense of relief. I don't want it to go wrong. It is not worthwhile to form a boy band. I already failed last time.

87
00:11:53,080 --> 00:12:00,800
Let's give it another shot. There's nothing to be worried about. I believe these boys will not disappoint us.

88
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:03,840
We can beat them anyway.

89
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:15,880
All right, everyone. I'll hand everyone the first task today to put each person's skills to the test.

90
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:23,600
I've already divided everybody into groups. So that everyone can work together.

91
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:26,800
Are you guys ready?

92
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,880
We're ready.

93
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:31,760
Okay, now I'll tell you who the members of each group are.

94
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:37,200
Are you ready? I think you are.

95
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,600
I don't know.

96
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:42,920
The first group's members are Kengkla and Namo.

97
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:49,040
The second group's memebers are Phupha and Tonnam

98
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:54,040
The third group, Mungkorn and Mawin.

99
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:01,360
The fourth group, Tul, Tin and Copper.

100
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,120
Three members?

101
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:05,840
Yes, three members.

102
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:13,800
Yes, this time I will ask each group to come up with a show that expresses your individuality.

103
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:19,560
You have to choose a song and create your own dance moves.
Anyone with an issue is welcome to discuss with me.

104
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:26,720
While we're rehearsing for the show, will there be a teacher coming in to help teach us?

105
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:33,480
Yes, but only once or twice a week to help guide you.

106
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:38,040
The teacher will assist in making the show more complete. The rest is all up to you.

107
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:40,640
And practise a lot.

108
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:41,480
Thank you so much.

109
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:48,800
Yes, it's a real deal after this. Anyway, keep fighting.

110
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,920
Fighting! Thank you.

111
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:57,680
Excited

112
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:58,960
I don't know. I haven't danced.

113
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:02,360
Maybe it depends on what kind of music we choose.

114
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,840
And now, how are you going to get back home?

115
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:10,360
Oh, before we go back, let's get something to eat. So we can try to come up with ideas.

116
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:11,720
Um, good idea.

117
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:16,920
And if we come up with an idea, we'll start practising tomorrow because we don't have much time.

118
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:20,880
That's a good idea because your and my teams can help each other think.

119
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,160
I'm open to everything.

120
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,840
So am I.

121
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:28,320
Let's get going.
Let's go!

122
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,440
You startled me.

123
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:45,960
I miss you. I didn't see you much today.

124
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,120
Why did you hit me?

125
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:55,360
I don't want anyone to see. I still don't want them to know we're dating.

126
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:57,920
I don't see anything wrong with it.

127
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:03,320
How can that be okay? They have regulations against dating. Don't you remember?

128
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:14,520
I remember, but rules are meant to be broken. It sounds like a lot of fun, especially if the company owner's grandson breaks it himself.

129
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:26,720
It's not funny. Uncle Kiat's credibility would be destroyed if others found out. It's important, babe.

130
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:30,000
I need to save my uncle's and the company's face.

131
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:34,400
These days, people believe that I used connections to be part of Red King.

132
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:38,720
Phupha, are you hungry?

133
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:39,880
A little.

134
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:41,280
Here are chives dumplings.

135
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:43,600
Thank you.

136
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:49,080
Hey, let's talk about the show. Does anyone have any ideas? We can help each other think.

137
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:59,080
Let's take it this way. We'll suggest what we're good at or what we enjoy. In order to create the show.

138
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:01,840
I'm good at nothing, though.

139
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:02,600
What?

140
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:10,640
It's not that much. Actually, I think my team can do anything, but I'd rather focus on singing.

141
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:13,840
What about you, Keng?

142
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:17,440
Me? I still can't figure it out.

143
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:18,960
Shit.

144
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,520
Um, what about you?

145
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:24,960
Would I ask you if I knew?

146
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:31,040
So we'll end the meeting and eat today. Let's think again tomorrow.

147
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:37,440
No, let's simply finish it today so we can start practising tomorrow. I don't want to waste time.

148
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:48,240
Mo, believe me, when your stomach is full, you'll come up with ideas.

149
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:50,280
I agree with Keng.

150
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:51,680
but when my stomach is full, I become sleepy.

151
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,560
If so, go sleep. Let's think tomorrow.

152
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:57,200
Okay okay I'll eat first.

153
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:01,080
I'll give this to you. I know you like oily ones.

154
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,599
Well, then I'll go home first.

155
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:11,200
Okay, see you.

156
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:12,720
P'Phu, Can I go with you.

157
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:17,680
OK, I'll drop you off. Will the two of you go with us? I can drop you off.

158
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,280
No problem; we can go home by ourselves.

159
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:22,200
Tell me if you reach home.

160
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:24,160
See ya

161
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:25,440
Bye bye

162
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:35,000
What's wrong?

163
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,960
nothing

164
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,080
I know you're not fine.

165
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,520
You're as good as your name.

166
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:56,640
Of course, you're normally not this type of person. Because the atmosphere around you appears to have changed.

167
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:00,520
If you have something to say to me, say it, or are you upset with me?

168
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:10,720
No, I'm not. I'm stressed. I'm also under pressure. I'm afraid I won't do well.

169
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:22,440
Oh, why are you stressed out? I got your back. If we do it together, it'll turn out great.

170
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:27,520
I'm afraid I'll make a mistake.

171
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:38,800
and I'm afraid I won't be able to continue. You know what my dream is, don't you? This one is also considered very close to it.

172
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:46,200
If something goes wrong I still can't imagine how sad I must be.

173
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:55,440
Let's do this, there's a place I'd like to take you to.

174
00:18:56,600 --> 00:19:00,240
When you go there, I guarantee you will feel more at ease.

175
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:07,360
Go ahead. What are you waiting for? Go ahead. Go quickly.

176
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:10,000
Keng! Where do we go? It hurts!

177
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:16,360
Keng, what are you doing?

178
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,400
Just come in.

179
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,440
hurry

180
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:52,600
You brought me to the temple this late at night. Somebody will find out. That's scary.

181
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:04,800
Don't be afraid that people will find out. You don't have to worry at all. Because I sneaked in often.

182
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:15,640
When it comes to ghosts, you don't have to be scared because late at night like this, thieves are much scarier.

183
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,120
Make a wish now.

184
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:46,640
Mo! Mo!

185
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,480
That was exhausting!

186
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:03,440
It must be.

187
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:05,720
You silly!

188
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,080
Why did you hit me, It hurts.

189
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:11,840
I served you right. You took me to the temple this late at night. We had been tricked by a ghost. See what I mean?

190
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:13,560
You are the one who followed me.

191
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:17,840
Oh my gosh, you dare say that. You really are the person who dragged me here.

192
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:20,280
Did I drag you?

193
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:21,880
You did!

194
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:26,520
I'm sorry, but why would you fear ghosts in a temple?

195
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,240
If you're not afraid, why were you running?

196
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:31,200
I saw you were startled, so I ran.

197
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,960
I'm sick of talking and don't want to talk to you anymore.

198
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:40,800
Or was it a sign from Buddha just now? that has acknowledged our prayers?

199
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:48,160
Mo! Wait for me!

200
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:15,360
You came so early.

201
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:17,040
Yes

202
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:19,760
How diligent.

203
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:25,320
I needed to get there on time, so I came to practise first. So that I'll be able to keep up with others

204
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:27,520
Good, do you need help?

205
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,080
That'd be great.

206
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:42,400
You remember the moves from yesterday, don't you? 5 6 7 8 One, two...

207
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:51,240
Good, next steps are step out and turn around. 5 6 7 8 One two..

208
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:53,600
Wow you came so early.

209
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:56,360
He still can't catch up. So he came to practice first.

210
00:22:57,560 --> 00:23:01,080
Then I'll dance too

211
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:03,840
Come on. I'll lead.

212
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:10,360
Great, you take the lead. Let's start again. Let's dance yesterday's move  5  6  7  8

My ankle

222
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:59,600
Let me see.

223
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:00,760
Hang in there.

224
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:15,960
It's swollen. I'll take you to sit and rest.
Get up slowly. Slowly

225
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:26,400
I'll keep your shoes. Ew, you should wash your feet.

226
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:34,080
Slowly walk. Come on. I'll use a cold compress.
/ Let's continue.

227
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:38,760
Alright, did you have to cross your left leg when you turned?

228
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:40,920
No, right leg. Got it?

229
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:42,520
Slowly walk

230
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:53,400
Sit here first.

231
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,800
Wait for me.

232
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:14,760
It's going to be a little chilly. Hold on. Tell me if you can't stand it.

233
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:20,080
I can do it on my own.

234
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:22,080
It's okay.

235
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:28,160
How is it? Do you feel better now?

236
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:56,560
I'm sorry.

237
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:09,320
Go 1  2  3  4 hand 5  6  7  8 turn 1  2
leg

238
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:11,320
Wait wait, I can't keep up. Take a break.

239
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:16,440
You wanna take a break? / Yes, let me take a sip of water.

240
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:30,480
Keng, Namo. Hello / Hello

241
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,360
Where's Mawin?

242
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:37,520
I thought he's already here. Is he in the locker room?

243
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:41,680
I was there just now, but I didn't see him.

244
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:44,080
I didn't see him either.

245
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:49,040
He's your friend, isn't he? Where is he?

246
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:51,480
How would I know?

247
00:26:51,480 --> 00:27:00,560
Bring him here right away, Korn. It's getting late. I don't want to hear those gripes. You know what I mean?

248
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:02,440
What has that got to do with me?

249
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:09,480
He's your best friend. Just bring him here. / Yes, quickly. We're running late. Go.

250
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:13,920
We're really being late.

251
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:38,360
There you go. Next, please.

252
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:49,000
This will be our recommended menu. / I'd like 1 pink milk and 1 coconut cake. Eat in.

253
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:50,720
120 baht.

254
00:27:53,480 --> 00:28:00,640
Thank you. Please wait a little. Next, please.

255
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:05,000
What's wrong with him? Why can't he just pick up the phone?

256
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:20,400
I recommend this one. It's our bestseller.

257
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:22,920
Alright! Ready? 5  6  7  8 Kick left Right down Left Right 5  6 Kick 7  8  9  1  2  9  3

258
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:28,400
4 5  6  7 Yes, one more time

259
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:38,360
Sorry, I'm late. Continue practising. / Why didn't you pick up the phone?

260
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:46,240
Calm down, Mungkorn.

261
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,200
What's happening?

262
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:53,680
I think they are arguing

263
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:57,400
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to do that.

264
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:01,440
It's my fault. I'm really sorry.

265
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:04,880
You have no responsibility at all. Don't you see that everybody is waiting for you?

266
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:11,480
I'm really sorry. It won't happen again.

267
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:19,720
You're here anyway. Go practise. / Yes, this already wastes a lot of practise time.

268
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:28,120
Okay! Ready? The first move 5  6  7  8 Kick left. Right down. Left Right

269
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:30,120
Let's hurry and take a look.

270
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:33,400
Your ankle hurts this much, do you still have to hurry?

271
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:37,200
I wanna know what happened.

272
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:45,640
I think we should not meddle in their affairs. It's none of our business.

273
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,840
I think I can walk on my own. Ouch!

274
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:54,000
Ton!

275
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:00,000
I'm okay.

276
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:04,360
Are you upset?

277
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:07,960
No, I'm not.

278
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,760
If you aren't, why do you look upset?

279
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:17,040
You just bagged on me.

280
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:21,960
I'm sorry; it wasn't my intention.

281
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:25,880
forget it

282
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:34,080
I'm a bad person. Because I was curious about other people.

283
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:51,080
Ton, I'm sorry. Where are you going? Wait for me. I'm sorry.

284
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:58,040
What you'd like to order?

285
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:01,240
I'd like Yuzu Americano

286
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:05,360
Yuzu Americano. What level of sweetness do you prefer?

287
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:07,360
Half sweet.

288
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:11,720
Please wait for a moment.

289
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:21,600
Hey!

290
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:28,360
Long time no see! You're getting more handsome.

291
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:32,720
You're exaggerating. How are you? Seems like you're loaded these days, huh?

292
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:35,120
Not bad

293
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:39,480
We haven’t met for quite a while. Last time we met was 2 years ago, wasn't it?

294
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:40,840
It was.

295
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:43,200
You were studying abroad.

296
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:47,280
Yes, I was. I just came back after graduating.

297
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:52,360
I think you were right. You made a lot of money as soon as you returned and started your own business.

298
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:55,120
You don't have to toil and hunt for part-time work there.

299
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:58,800
I was lucky that I decided to do so.

300
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:01,400
Did you order?

301
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:03,800
I have. But I haven't got it yet. Do you want to order something

302
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:07,640
I'm alright. I already ate. I'll order later.

303
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:08,720
Okay

304
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:13,720
My schedule has just become extremely full. Class in dancing and singing. Chaotic.

305
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:15,160
You must be busy.

306
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:16,520
Here's your drink.

307
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:19,840
Thank you. / Hey! Mawin. Do you work here?

308
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:25,240
Yes. Enjoy your drink. / Thank you.

309
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,520
Do you know him?

310
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:38,280
He's my junior at the company. Oh! It's time. I have to go practise.

311
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:40,080
Is your company far from here?

312
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:43,160
A little bit. Are you going somewhere next?

313
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:47,200
I'll go home. I have an appointment with my family.

314
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:49,200
Okay, see ya!

315
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:52,720
Copper!

316
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:55,520
what's up?

317
00:33:57,080 --> 00:34:02,400
Please don't tell anyone that I work here.

318
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:08,360
I won't

319
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:13,760
But doing part-time job isn't something embarrassing though.

320
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:19,360
I know, anyways , please keep it as a secret.

321
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:27,920
anyways make time to practise thoroughly. Don't let it disturb your practise time.

322
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:37,520
If a single person is missing, the team will be unable to practise fully. Also, it takes advantage of your friends.

323
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:40,800
I understand

324
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:45,280
If there's anything I can help , let me know. I gotta go.

325
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:48,480
Thank you so much. See you later

326
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:07,040
Did you wait long?

327
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:09,200
No, I didn't. I also just arrived.

328
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:12,440
Let's go inside. It's hot here.

329
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:14,240
Okay okay

330
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:17,280
Hey, you want more old cassette tapes, right?

331
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:23,480
Yes, but I don't know specifically which one. I want to take a look first.

332
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:28,040
Sure. There sure are a lot to choose from. Maybe you'll find the secret ones.

333
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:30,880
Those must be pricey.

334
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:35,960
Have a look first. I have a regular shop. I'll take you there.

335
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:49,440
Please take a look.

336
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:50,480
yes

337
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:02,560
Is this your dad's first album.

338
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:03,720
It is.

339
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:07,800
It's hard to find nowadays.

340
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:09,720
Especially this album.

341
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:15,600
Let me see. Oh, my dad was so handsome at that time.

342
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:20,760
But I look like hime, don't I? Am I handsome just like my dad?

343
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:23,960
Don't flatter yourself.

344
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:28,120
Give it back to me.

345
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:32,960
By the way, do you still listen to my dad's songs?

346
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:39,760
I thought you don't listen to them anymore. Who will listen to them in this day and age?

347
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:44,640
I always listen because I like.

348
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:54,640
When I look closely, you two do look alike. But you're a little bit less handsome than your father.

349
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:57,320
Am I not handsome?

350
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:01,600
I said you're a little bit less handsome. Why can't you just give in to your own father?

351
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:03,840
Who do you like more?
