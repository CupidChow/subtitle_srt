1
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,039
I'm feeling hungry. Any ideas on what we should grab to eat?

2
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:13,960
Why did Kengkla go back home so early?

3
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,480
Is he okay?

4
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,200
I have no idea.

5
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,880
Are you guys in a fight?

6
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:23,760
I'm sorry.

7
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,520
By the way, I want to be as good as you.

8
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:33,120
Big companies are vying to take you.

9
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:45,120
You're already skilled at this. Keep practicing, and you'll continue to improve.

10
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:49,960
What should we eat?

11
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:52,759
How about the chive dumplings?

12
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,120
Sorry for dragging you out at this hour.

13
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,200
It's totally fine.

14
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,840
Are you okay?

15
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:27,160
I am okay.

16
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:35,079
Are you sure? If there's anything you're not okay with, feel free to let me know.

17
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:39,880
Maybe you can vent a bit, so you won't have to handle it all on your own.

18
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,240
It's up to you.

19
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:53,480
You don't need to share if you're not comfortable yet.

20
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:57,480
Alternatively, you don't have to share at all. It's totally fine. Do what makes you feel comfortable.

21
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,680
Actually, I'm currently feeling down.

22
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,840
I'm having a little fight with Kengkla.

23
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,080
I was thoughtless. I criticised his beliefs.

24
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:21,440
And when he started feeling better, I ended up hurting his feelings again.

25
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:27,000
Now I regret saying those things.

26
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:32,120
What do you think your next steps should be?

27
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,360
I want to apologise to him.

28
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:43,640
You know what? To me, he's a really good friend.

29
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:49,240
I don't want to lose him.

30
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:54,320
I think you already know the answer.

31
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,240
I do.

32
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,200
But you don't know where to start, do you?

33
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,160
Kind of.

34
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:19,240
If you're feeling bad, it might be a good idea to apologise.

35
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:25,520
Apologising first doesn't necessarily imply fault or losing.

36
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:29,720
But it means you care.

37
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:39,159
Will he stop being angry with me?

38
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:43,760
First, just say sorry. You won't know until you do it, am I correct?

39
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,080
Thank you.

40
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:56,880
Anytime.

41
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,520
I'm feeling much better now.

42
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:51,320
Damn, seriously?

43
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:59,960
Namo! Namo!

44
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:03,480
Is something wrong?

45
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,880
Are you planning to move to MChange?

46
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,360
I didn't catch that. What did you say?

47
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,680
Come out, and let's have a talk.

48
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:21,040
Okay, wait a second.

49
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:32,159
What's up? Why are you being so loud?

50
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:34,680
What’s crackin’?

51
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:39,760
So?

52
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,520
Are you moving to MChange?

53
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:50,240
Where'd you hear that?

54
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,480
This.

55
00:06:56,120 --> 00:07:00,040
So, you're talking to me now, all because of this matter?

56
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:09,120
Yes, but I won't let you move, no matter what.

57
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,520
Who would I stick with if you moved?

58
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:20,920
You've got loads of friends, practically everyone in the company. You'll be fine.

59
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,960
But there's no one like you.

60
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:32,560
You know me the best.

61
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:39,159
And you made a promise that we'd succeed together.

62
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:13,840
Hey.

63
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,640
I'm sorry.

64
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:26,960
For what?

65
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:33,400
For avoiding.

66
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:42,080
I was really upset, so I didn't feel like talking to you.

67
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:50,000
If you were so upset, why did you choose to talk to me?

68
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:53,560
Are you worried about me leaving and finding happiness on my own?

69
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:57,600
Don't use a sarcastic tone.

70
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,440
But it's true

71
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:08,040
I'm really scared you'll leave.

72
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,720
I also need to apologise

73
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:19,600
for thinking your beliefs were nonsense.

74
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:23,400
I shouldn't have looked down on that.

75
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:29,640
In reality, what doesn't make sense to someone

76
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:33,120
might make perfect sense to another.

77
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:40,800
You don't have to worry.

78
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:49,120
I'm sorry about our promise.

79
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:56,240
I genuinely meant what I said at that time.

80
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:03,440
And if in the future, this project become successful,

81
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:09,760
We'll be able to achieve our dreams and fulfil our promises.

82
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:18,360
I understand.

83
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:23,360
Now, I'm feeling alright.

84
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:31,640
So, I guess we're good now.

85
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,320
Yeah.

86
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,160
What's wrong?

87
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,040
So,

88
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,880
I..

89
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,040
Just say it.

90
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:20,240
I don't dare to say. You can just ask me anything, literally anything.

91
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:27,000
I don't want to ask, but you have something to say, don't you?

92
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,160
I'm not sure how to put it into words.

93
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,400
Will you say it? If not, I'll go now.

94
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,360
Don't go.

95
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:40,080
I'll say it. Have a seat.

96
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:46,760
Hurry up. If you've got something to say, say it fast.

97
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,800
Just say it.

98
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,640
I like you

99
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:01,280
but not in a friendly way.

100
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:11,880
Avoiding you made me realise my true feelings for you.

101
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,600
I can't be without you.

102
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,760
What about you?

103
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:33,480
I won't tell you.

104
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,040
Namo!

105
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:20,960
Overall, it's not that good yet.

106
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:24,520
Copper, you have to be more confident

107
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:25,080
I got it.

108
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:30,000
Namo, it wasn't very good.

109
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:39,920
Trin, I expected more from you.

110
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:47,880
It wasn't good. When you were with Tul, you both did very well. You supported each other.

111
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:53,440
But being separated like this, it clearly looks worse.

112
00:13:56,680 --> 00:14:02,400
You're still quite far behind Tul. Anyway, just practise a lot.

113
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:09,400
Let's correct the mistake you made earlier.

114
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:19,200
Ready! 5 6 7 8 Go 1 2 3 4 Go 5

115
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:25,440
Finished practising? Let's go grab something to eat.

116
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,200
Hm?

117
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:31,960
What's wrong with him?

118
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:46,120
I know how you feel. Don't stress too much.

119
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:49,080
Stressing doesn't make things better.

120
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:56,000
I'll help you with dancing. Don't worry.

121
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:01,280
I got your back.

122
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:06,880
I'll help you as well.

123
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:12,920
Thank you.

124
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:27,680
For Mungkorn and Mawin, who couldn't make it today, I want everyone to fill them in on what we discussed.

125
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:37,160
For this assignment, we need to collaborate because we're up against Red King.

126
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:42,800
To show people that the boys from the Beyond the Star project are as talented.

127
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:45,760
Excuse me.

128
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:51,280
We've just formed the group, and Red King has already made their debut.

129
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:58,640
I know what you're going to say, but if we don't give it a shot, we won't know how prepared we actually are.

130
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:03,600
Isn't this project for finding actors?

131
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:08,320
It seems like we're being trained to become artists.

132
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:14,440
We're finding talented artists.

133
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:20,840
Because in this era, everyone has to be capable of doing everything due to intense competition.

134
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:29,600
But if anyone is not okay or can't handle it, you can withdraw. The company won't say anything.

135
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,960
Anyway, do your best.

136
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:43,440
Roger that.

137
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:50,480
Hey.

138
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:58,600
This isn't what I expected. Why do we have to practise dancing and singing so much?

139
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:04,800
I auditioned here because I want to be an actor.

140
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:13,240
But what we do every day, who is it really for?

141
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:18,440
See? You're starting to feel it, aren't you?

142
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:26,400
Come on, when I look at it from a different perspective, I think if any opportunity comes up, let's just seize it.

143
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:34,560
Because whatever happens, it's all going to become our experience.

144
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:40,480
As Araya mentioned, nowadays, the competition is fierce.

145
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:45,520
We need to be well prepared and excel in every aspect so that we can compete with others.

146
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:54,760
I'll say I understand, but I don't grasp everything.

147
00:17:56,800 --> 00:18:02,680
Hey, why don't you stop overthinking? Didn't you ask me to fight together with you?

148
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:11,080
You should take the time to practice. If you're stressed out, nothing productive will happen. It's just a waste of time.

149
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,600
Let's go pray together.

150
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,080
How frustrating.

151
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:25,200
Why?

152
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:42,880
Take a seat.

153
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:47,040
I bought this for you.

154
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:48,440
Thanks

155
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:57,800
Just take it as my apology for the way I behaved badly towards you that day.

156
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,400
You don't need to apologise.

157
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:05,080
I won't do it again.

158
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:14,280
It's okay. I'm not angry at all. You're fine just being yourself.

159
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:17,920
People who like you like you for who you are.

160
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,000
Okay.

161
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:30,080
I gathered you all today because I want you to be ready for the battle stage with the Beyond the Star project.

162
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:33,160
We have to show them that we're better.

163
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:42,000
But I think it's inappropriate. Why should we lower ourselves to compete with those noobs?

164
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:46,800
It's an opportunity to prove that we are truly great.

165
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:51,800
And on top of that, we get to give Araya's company a good slap in the face if we win.

166
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:59,480
I would like to remind her that KJ agency is in a less advantageous position than us.

167
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:03,640
If that's the case, we'd like to go practise.

168
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:27,920
Hello, Mr. Kiat.

169
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,480
It's time to take action.

170
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:38,640
Copy that.

171
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:48,360
What is the purpose of the battle stage, exactly?

172
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:50,880
It's there to gauge our abilities,

173
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:56,320
or is it just to fulfil Mr. Kiat's needs?

174
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:11,840
You can inform Mr. Kiat so that he's aware of what he's doing.

175
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:16,120
So he won't use our dreams as his tools.

176
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,000
What happened?

177
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:22,000
Nothing

178
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:23,440
Let's go.

179
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:34,920
Has anything happened?

180
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,440
No, we were chitchatting.

181
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,200
I'm hungry, let's find something to eat.

182
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:45,080
Let's go.

183
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,840
Is there something specific you want to eat?

184
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,840
No, I can eat anything.

185
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:59,440
Um, I think we should have some dessert.

186
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:01,400
It will make you feel better.

187
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:02,560
Sounds good.

188
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:09,520
That place looks nice.

189
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:11,520
Aha! Let me grab a drink real quick.

190
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:12,680
Sure!

191
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:19,720
I'll have Frizzy Salak.

192
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:21,920
Okay, please wait a moment.

193
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:29,920
Are you thinking about something?

194
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:32,520
You look stressed.

195
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:35,240
I'm thinking nothing.

196
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:44,120
If there's something bothering you, feel free to let me know.

197
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:49,360
Yes, I know. If there is, I will tell you.

198
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:51,520
Okay!

199
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,960
Your order is ready. It's 25 baht.

200
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,600
Thank you.

201
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:13,880
Namo!

202
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:15,000
Kita!

203
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,480
What are you doing here?

204
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:20,480
I just finished practising, so I'm here to grab something to eat.

205
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,440
And this is..

206
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:28,960
This is my best friend in the company, Natee.

207
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:29,840
Hi.

208
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:31,240
This is Namo.

209
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:34,280
Hold on.

210
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,480
Hello.

211
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:43,360
Hello, is this Namo speaking?

212
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,000
Yes, I'm speaking.

213
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:49,200
I'm Pleng, Mr. Kiat's secretary. Mr. Kiat wants to meet you.

214
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:52,280
Mr. Kiat?

215
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:54,440
That's correct.

216
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,720
He wants to meet me now?

217
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:02,120
Yes, please come and visit so he won't have to wait.

218
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:03,320
I understood.

219
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:07,640
What's going on?

220
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,680
Mr. Kiat wants to meet me.

221
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:12,440
Why?

222
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:13,880
He wants to meet you now?

223
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:14,920
Yeah.

224
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,920
I think it's because he wants me to join his company.

225
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:19,760
I'll go with you.

226
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:23,320
You don't have to. I can go by myself. I don't want to cause you any trouble.

227
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,200
Are you sure?

228
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:27,200
Of course, I can go on my own.

229
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:32,800
So if anything unusual happens, please call me right away.

230
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,360
Alright.

231
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:37,680
Wait, how much is it?

232
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:39,280
It's the exact amount.

233
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:44,080
I must go.

234
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:47,080
Don't forget to call.

235
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:48,160
Okay.

236
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:09,880
Come in.

237
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:18,680
Hello.

238
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:21,120
Have a seat.

239
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:21,920
Thank you.

240
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:29,640
Sorry for being so sudden, I'm an impatient person.

241
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:33,120
By the way, have you made a decision?

242
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:35,240
Will you move to MChange?

243
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,280
I haven't made a decision yet.

244
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:45,440
I don't want to leave Kengkla and my friends at the company.

245
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:48,280
I don't want to betray Ms. Araya.

246
00:25:53,320 --> 00:26:01,360
How about this? If KJ Agency loses the next battle, you'll have to join my company.

247
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:06,560
I'll cover the 2 million contract breakup fee for you.

248
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:12,840
Plus a small amount of gratitude money for you.

249
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:24,720
Anyway, I'll need to consider it first.

250
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:34,560
Okay, if you make a decision, contact Pleng immediately.

251
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:36,920
I got it.

252
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:03,680
Are you alright?

253
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:07,960
Who is Namo?

254
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:14,640
Namo is my friend from high school.

255
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:18,640
Just friend?

256
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:37,520
Namo.

257
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:43,640
Namo, don't go.

258
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,880
I thought it was something else?

259
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,680
So what?

260
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:58,960
Is there anything else you want to tell me?

261
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,400
Well

262
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:10,160
Namo is my ex, but we ended things amicably.

263
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:13,240
So, our relationship is like best friends.

264
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:22,200
You know my intuition is sharp. Don't let it be revealed that you're secretly cheating.

265
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:24,760
Hey.

266
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:33,640
That's never going to happen. I promise.

267
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:16,560
5  6  7  8  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  1
2  3  4  5  6  7 Hey! Stop!

268
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:20,480
Namo! What's wrong?

269
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:23,080
Please focus.

270
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:27,400
I'm sorry.

271
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:28,800
Please focus on practising.

272
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:31,560
It's already very tiring.

273
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:39,280
Let's do the chorus again. 5 6 7 8

274
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:44,600
Are you alright?

275
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:50,480
I'm alright.

276
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,760
That means he's not.

277
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:01,840
If I were in your shoes, I'd probably be worried too.

278
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:06,000
Actually, I'm okay.

279
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:10,840
I'm just afraid of losing.

280
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:14,160
If I lose, I have to join MChange.

281
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,160
Hello

282
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:22,160
Hello, dear.

283
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:27,480
You don't have to worry. I believe you'll be great.

284
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:29,600
What brings you here?

285
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:32,200
Follow the smell of incense sticks, like most spirits do.

286
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:37,560
Just kidding. I heard the sound of people talking, so I followed the noise.

287
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:41,920
Thank you.

288
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:46,480
I suggest you not to worry about this.

289
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:51,080
You have to practise, if you want to win.

290
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:58,400
If you're overly concerned about winning or losing, it means you're already losing.

291
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:06,960
In fact, I think you should quickly regain your composure

292
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:12,640
because we were fully intent on practicing.

293
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:17,600
I agree. I will practise hard too.

294
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:20,640
You won't know until you try.

295
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:25,200
We just have to do our best, right?

296
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:30,480
See? Everyone is ready except you, Namo.

297
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:32,480
Let's go to practise everyone.

298
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:35,560
Let's go.

299
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:37,160
Do our best.

300
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:43,320
It was good, earlier.

301
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:48,080
Trin, you have to dance sharper.

302
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:57,880
If any dance moves have to stop, they really have to stop. Otherwise, if everyone stops and you keep moving, it will stand out.

303
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:05,160
Tul, you have to lower your energy because you're overdoing it.

304
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:09,280
The rest is not bad.

305
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:13,360
I have no advice other than to practice a lot.

306
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:18,520
Noted. Thank you so much. We'll fix it immediately.

307
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:20,520
Thank you.

308
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:25,480
What are you waiting? Let's practise.

309
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:34,600
Ready! 5 6 7 8

310
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:35,880
What's next?

311
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:38,560
Then this.

312
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:43,680
Let me help you.

313
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:47,680
Copper, how to do the first move?

314
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:48,160
Which one?

315
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:50,800
Is it like this for the part where we have to step out?

316
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:54,440
This one goes like this. Let's do it together.

317
00:32:55,240 --> 00:33:00,200
1 2 3 Go! 1 2 3

318
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,280
Wave like this.

319
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:07,280
Bye bye.

320
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:09,000
Really?

321
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:12,040
I was joking. Then you do it like this.

322
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:15,560
You have to do this seducing move.

323
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:17,080
Copper, do it properly.

324
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:22,840
I'll do it properly now. 1 2 3 Go!

325
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:30,960
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8

326
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:33,040
Can you guys stop joking around?

327
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:43,280
How annoying,

328
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:58,280
Tul

329
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:04,360
What's wrong?

330
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:12,960
I don't see any of you being serious about practising. It seems like you're just playing around.

331
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:22,040
I don't want you to be stressed. Practising is already stressful enough.

332
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:26,639
Especially if we take it seriously all the time, we'll get a headache.

333
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:30,480
I just want to make a more relax atmosphere.

334
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:35,560
He's got the point.
We should practise without stress.

335
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:39,239
But we have to compete with Red King.

336
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:44,480
If we don't be serious, we'll definitely lose.

337
00:34:51,159 --> 00:34:54,320
It's my fault. I was the one who started.

338
00:34:58,120 --> 00:35:02,360
I understand why you are upset with me. I'm genuinely sorry.

339
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:08,640
I promise I won't play around again. Please forgive me.

340
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:12,520
Please.

341
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:14,920
Don't use that kind of voice.

342
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:18,480
Just knowing that you have done something wrong is enough.

343
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:23,760
I just want everyone to take practising seriously.

344
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:31,400
Trin is not that great yet. If we continue to play around like this, the result won't be favorable.

345
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:38,120
I understand. I'll help both of you, okay?

346
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:44,000
Oh, you guys reconciled quickly.

347
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:46,480
We should rush back to practise.

348
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:48,400
Go.

349
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:53,640
Be serious. Don't let me catch you playing again.

350
00:35:58,800 --> 00:35:59,880
Thank you.

351
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:01,760
Your dancing improved a lot.

352
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:02,840
Yes.

353
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:09,160
I told you that if you keep practising, you'll get better at it.

354
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:14,000
It's very late now, should we go home?

355
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:14,880
Yes.

356
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:26,080
Phupha, I'm very grateful for everything you've done for me.

357
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:32,240
Whether it's helping me with my practice or taking care of me. And I have something to tell you.

358
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:39,320
Well, I

359
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:44,760
I like you.

360
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:57,000
Tonnam, I'll take you home.

361
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:05,400
See you tomorrow.

362
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:14,240
Do you want to go sit in my room for a bit?

363
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:32,840
Here's your water.

364
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:34,200
Thanks

365
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:09,000
Phupha, when I told you I like you, I truly meant it.

366
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:18,000
I know. I haven't said anything.

367
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:25,520
What shall we do next?

368
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:34,480
Just like I've said, we can try talking first.

369
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:42,280
Um, alright.

370
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:47,800
What's wrong?

371
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:51,400
Nothing.

372
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:02,000
Did I make you doubt it?

373
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:05,680
Who knows?

374
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:09,320
When you take care of me,

375
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:12,960
it might just be in a friendly way.

376
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:23,080
Is this still in a friendly way?

377
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:40,120
Phupha.

378
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:45,120
Do I still make you doubt?

379
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:47,400
No.
