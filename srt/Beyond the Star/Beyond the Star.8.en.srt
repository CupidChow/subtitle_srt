1
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:09,440
Darn, how did I lose?

2
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:11,240
The loser has to go shopping.

3
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:12,770
Get up now.

4
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:14,520
I was about to win.

5
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:16,710
Just go.

6
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:18,910
This sucks.

7
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,490
Let's play another round while waiting.

8
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:24,850
Alright! Players like you must have a match with me.

9
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:26,360
Okay! I'll choose my character first.

10
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:26,860
The same character?

11
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:27,510
Aha!

12
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:16,430
Can I take a bath first? I smell bad.

13
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,490
Then,

14
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:27,030
how about taking a bath together?

15
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:31,760
Are you sure? What if Tul comes back?

16
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:32,710
It's okay.

17
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,510
It won't take long.

18
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:37,650
Please

19
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:45,120
I promise I will hurry and finish it.

20
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:52,440
Okay

21
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:17,790
Trin?

22
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:19,730
Copper?

23
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:23,640
Where are they?

24
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:08,080
Oh? When did you return? I'm hungry and in the mood for BBQ now.

25
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:13,950
Aren't you guys full yet?

26
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:20,870
What do you mean? I don't get it.

27
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:31,800
I saw everything, what the two of you did in the bathroom.

28
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,190
I have a shitty brother.

29
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,480
What did I do wrong?

30
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:49,020
What the heck is wrong with you? Did you already forget what we promised?

31
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,840
Does being around a guy get you that turned on?

32
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:57,070
Does being around a guy get you that turned on?

33
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:03,480
Hey, why are you saying things like that? I'm your brother.

34
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:08,250
If I had a brother like you, I'd prefer to be an only child

35
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:10,340
You bastard!

36
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:12,310
Hey!

37
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:13,590
Stop it!

38
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:25,240
From now on, you and I are no longer brothers.

39
00:06:46,360 --> 00:07:01,380
1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8 Left side
1  2  3  4 Don't forget to point you foot 5  6  7

40
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:10,240
Where are Tonnam, Mungkorn and Mawin?

41
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:14,190
Are they not coming?

42
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:21,240
Mawin requested a week off because he needed to take care of his sick mother

43
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:27,390
And Mungkorn also requested a week's leave because he'd like to help Mawin.

44
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:32,530
I've attempted to reach out to Tonnam, but there's been no response from him at all.

45
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:42,470
Ah, that's alright. So today, we'll continue delving into the details of the dance. You haven't practised in a while, you might forget

46
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:49,920
We'll revise the hook in a moment, prompting muscle memory to come back.

47
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:58,909
Come on! 5  6  7  8  1  2

48
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:09,370
1  2 and 3  4  5  6  7  8 Okay, great!

49
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:14,130
That's it for today. Don't forget to practise a lot.

50
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:17,950
Thank you.

51
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:20,990
Let's eat

52
00:08:27,030 --> 00:08:27,990
Do you want to come with us?

53
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,180
Sure.

54
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,580
Let's go grab some food.

55
00:08:34,169 --> 00:08:36,980
Sorry, I want to be alone.

56
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:11,940
Tonnam doesn't answer the call.

57
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:14,640
What will you do next?

58
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:19,080
But he also picks up the phone.

59
00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:28,540
Can you contact him?

60
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:30,000
No

61
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:34,640
Has anyone gone to see him at his house?

62
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:36,200
We haven't.

63
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:40,940
How about going to his house?

64
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:43,160
I think it's a good idea.

65
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:45,000
Let's go right away.

66
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:46,400
I'll drive.

67
00:09:52,570 --> 00:09:57,600
Tonnam!

68
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,600
He still doesn't answer the call?

69
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,020
Yes

70
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:03,550
So, shall we just climb in?

71
00:10:04,130 --> 00:10:04,950
Shall we?

72
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:07,230
Okay

73
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:08,440
Be careful.

74
00:10:10,390 --> 00:10:17,040
Tonnam!

75
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,700
What to do, Phupa?

76
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,750
What should I do, Namo? Namo, please help me.

77
00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:23,620
Hand me the pillow.

78
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:27,680
Tonnam!

79
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:30,360
Tonnam! Wake up!

80
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,540
Please wake up.

81
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:47,750
Tonnam

82
00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:51,620
He woke up. Are you okay?

83
00:10:55,010 --> 00:10:56,400
Drink some water.

84
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:08,840
Thank you.

85
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:11,410
How do you feel now?

86
00:11:18,570 --> 00:11:20,780
I'm sorry, everyone.

87
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:25,000
I'm sorry I made you worried.

88
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:32,560
It's okay. No need to apologise.

89
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:35,200
You didn't do anything wrong.

90
00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:44,970
If you're not feeling okay, you can always talk to us. We're here to listen.

91
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:51,240
I'm tired.

92
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:56,140
I feel like there's no one beside me.

93
00:11:57,580 --> 00:12:06,840
Since my parents are gone, I feel like I'm fighting alone, and it's exhausting.

94
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:16,360
I feel like I'm not good at anything, and I can't keep up with anyone

95
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:25,560
Even though I tried hard to practise, nothing seemed to improve.

96
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:33,000
I would like to speak as someone who has been with you since the beginning.

97
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:41,220
I assure you that you have improved since the first day, and your dancing has also gotten better.

98
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:48,140
Don't think that no one sees. Many people, including myself, see your efforts.

99
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:52,600
We see it too.

100
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:58,680
Thank you so much.

101
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:11,660
Then, after this, let's give it another shot.

102
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,250
You've got all of us.

103
00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:23,070
You're already doing great.

104
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:35,120
5  6  7  8  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8
1  2

105
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,120
Hey! Tonnam!

106
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:41,820
I'm glad you're back.

107
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:42,750
Are you alright?

108
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:43,990
You're okay now, aren't you?

109
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:47,580
Let's get back to practice.

110
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:49,580
Come on! Let's do it!

111
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:51,880
5 6 7 8

112
00:13:51,960 --> 00:14:00,770
1  2  3  4  5  6  7 and 8  1  2  3  3  4
5  6

113
00:14:00,770 --> 00:14:02,200
What the heck do you think you're doing?

114
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,440
Stop!

115
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:05,880
Tul! What the hell is wrong with you?

116
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:08,610
Stop!

117
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:09,700
What are you doing?

118
00:14:10,930 --> 00:14:13,070
Stop!

119
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:04,680
It's okay, it will pass.

120
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,200
Is it so wrong if we're together?

121
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:22,800
Do you think being honest with your feelings is wrong?

122
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,730
I don't think so.

123
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:38,260
I think we'd better just stop here.

124
00:15:42,170 --> 00:15:46,130
What do you mean? I don't understand.

125
00:15:49,370 --> 00:15:54,490
Let's just be brothers. I don't want to fight with Tul again.

126
00:15:57,620 --> 00:16:01,170
What about me? What did I do wrong?

127
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:09,120
This matter is up to you.

128
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:14,680
Just be honest with yourself and love yourself.

129
00:16:15,690 --> 00:16:17,460
It's just that.

130
00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:23,420
But that's my family.

131
00:16:29,210 --> 00:16:31,620
And I'm just an outsider.

132
00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:52,440
I said everything I wanted to say.

133
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:59,470
Whatever choice you make, I've got to accept it.

134
00:17:13,819 --> 00:17:20,240
Namo, do you believe me? I think we have to  go make merit again.

135
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:27,660
Tonnam's issue is resolved, and now we have Tul and Trin's matter

136
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:33,560
Trouble never comes alone.

137
00:17:35,330 --> 00:17:40,530
Right? There are only troubles. I'm getting a headache.

138
00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:49,580
What should we do now?

139
00:17:54,450 --> 00:17:55,820
I have no idea.

140
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:55,560
I believe this song is going to become popular.

141
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,570
I couldn't agree more.

142
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:04,120
I believe this song has the potential to make our company truly famous.

143
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:07,750
Kita, get ready to become famous.

144
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:10,980
Thank you!

145
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:17,160
Kiat

146
00:19:25,270 --> 00:19:27,840
Isn't this the song you wrote?

147
00:19:29,790 --> 00:19:31,050
It certainly is.

148
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:34,420
Kiat is really bad.

149
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:36,420
This is stealing.

150
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:39,350
I will deal with them, those evil bastards.

151
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:51,680
When I refused to give the song away, he forced me to leave the group.

152
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:55,990
And now he's using the song I wrote. What's going on?

153
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:06,040
You just wait and see. One day, I'll bring down Kiat and his company.

154
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:10,320
Kiat and his company must have experienced the same defeat as you did

155
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:22,140
I gathered everyone here today because there's something I'd like to discuss.

156
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:29,190
I don't think making music would be suitable for our company.

157
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:32,830
Because no matter what, we couldn't compete with MChange.

158
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:36,960
I've decided to change my plans.

159
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:42,750
I agree. Creating a boy band, I can foresee the potential losses.

160
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:46,840
I believe in Ms. Araya, no matter what

161
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:59,200
Alright, then let's restart together.

162
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,890
I want everyone to join in and support each other.

163
00:21:01,890 --> 00:21:02,540
Roger that.

164
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:15,080
5  6  7  8 Up 1  2  3  4  9  5  6
7  8 Down 1  2  3  4 Back 5  6  7 Turn 8

165
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:25,920
Go 1  2 Go 3  4 Go 5  6  7  8  1  9  2
Down 3  4 Back 5  6  9 Go 1  2  3

166
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:33,300
5  6  7 Point 8 This move has to be done slowly before we go to the next verse.

167
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:35,950
Hi

168
00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:37,100
Hello

169
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:39,100
I have something to tell all of you.

170
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:44,720
I have to cancel the boy band project

171
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:45,830
Yes!

172
00:21:47,370 --> 00:21:49,370
There's no need for others to be upset.

173
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:52,580
I will switch to a different project instead.

174
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:54,480
Is that true?

175
00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:56,320
Yes

176
00:21:58,050 --> 00:22:04,610
After this, let's fight together again. I guarantee I won't disappoint anyone.

177
00:22:14,590 --> 00:22:16,740
Breaking News

178
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:23,370
KJ Agency is about to launch an exciting new project. Stay tuned and let's see what unfolds

179
00:22:40,990 --> 00:22:42,930
I'd like to have a conversation with you.

180
00:22:55,210 --> 00:22:57,350
I think I'll distance myself from Copper.

181
00:22:59,330 --> 00:23:00,650
Are you alright?

182
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:06,480
I will try to forget our promise.

183
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:14,450
Today, I see that you are happy.

184
00:23:16,610 --> 00:23:21,310
Seeing you with someone who cares for you makes me feel good.

185
00:23:27,850 --> 00:23:28,980
Tul

186
00:23:32,490 --> 00:23:34,450
Siblings are inseparable

187
00:23:38,170 --> 00:23:39,570
Or is it not true?

188
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:56,160
Thanks

189
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:01,860
What is he going to do?

190
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:03,930
Wait and see

191
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:06,440
Well, it's definitely good.

192
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:08,220
First, take five incense sticks each.

193
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:11,240
Hand them to your friends.

194
00:25:11,250 --> 00:25:12,650
Pass them.

195
00:25:18,090 --> 00:25:22,680
After we get the incense sticks, we'll pray for blessings from the moon

196
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:28,570
Today is a propitious day. If we make a wish to the moon, success is guaranteed to come swiftly.

197
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:32,390
Are you ready? Let's begin.

198
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:12,200
Namo

199
00:26:14,410 --> 00:26:15,310
Yeah

200
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:26,020
Out of the blue, you're aware of my feelings for you, right?

201
00:26:30,870 --> 00:26:31,770
Yeah.

202
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:37,400
So, let's give dating a try, shall we?

203
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:38,480
What?

204
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:42,800
Are you asking me to date you right now

205
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:43,880
Yes

206
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,520
What's gotten into you?

207
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:53,430
Nothing has gotten into me. I just want you to know how I feel.

208
00:26:53,430 --> 00:26:57,300
I just want to get some encouragement before our debut press conference.

209
00:26:59,670 --> 00:27:00,520
Kengkla

210
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:07,120
Did you know that your timing is terrible?

211
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:12,560
hm? Why?

212
00:27:13,570 --> 00:27:18,040
Don't you want to date me?

213
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:25,760
Not like that, but I just want you to focus on the duties you have right now.

214
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,300
Alright

215
00:27:34,030 --> 00:27:35,890
I didn't reject you.

216
00:27:38,070 --> 00:27:40,070
But I just haven't given you an answer yet.

217
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:48,080
Ask me again after the press conference.

218
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,520
But

219
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:58,880
I want it to be romantic, not like this.

220
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:03,340
Okay

221
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:23,000
Hello to all members of the media, as well as our fans here and back home.

222
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:27,600
We are at the press conference for the launch of KJ Agency's new project.

223
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:30,170
Want the scoop?

224
00:28:30,170 --> 00:28:33,200
Let's meet the stars and dive into the excitement.

225
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:44,320
Hello

226
00:28:56,820 --> 00:29:03,660
We are actors from Beyond the Star series.

227
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:20,180
The battle has concluded. Now, do you know who has the upper hand?

228
00:29:21,250 --> 00:29:28,420
I acknowledge that your boys are truly talented, but that doesn't mean my boys aren't good as well.

229
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:36,920
You saw the performance. I lost because you had a larger fan base.

230
00:29:37,890 --> 00:29:45,260
I believe our two companies have different strengths.

231
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:47,020
If we want to go further, let's join forces, shall we?

232
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:50,460
Anyway, two heads are better than one.

233
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:54,670
What will I gain from this deal?

234
00:29:55,850 --> 00:30:02,720
I have the funds. I can provide enough for you to launch numerous projects without any concerns.

235
00:30:03,570 --> 00:30:04,540
Deal.

236
00:30:05,130 --> 00:30:08,940
Hey, won't you take a moment to think?

237
00:30:09,510 --> 00:30:12,640
Is there a lot to consider when it comes to money?

238
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:20,660
Suddenly, there's a source of funds right in front of you. If I don't seize it quickly, I'd be foolish.

239
00:30:45,390 --> 00:30:46,360
Hey

240
00:30:49,790 --> 00:30:51,020
Hey

241
00:30:55,050 --> 00:30:56,080
What's wrong?

242
00:30:57,940 --> 00:31:01,560
Do you remember what we've talked about?

243
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:06,630
What did we talk about?

244
00:31:09,330 --> 00:31:11,400
About you asking me to date you.

245
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:15,570
That I told you I'll give an answer after the press conference.

246
00:31:24,230 --> 00:31:27,220
Aha, I remember.

247
00:31:33,110 --> 00:31:35,540
This is my answer.

248
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:53,840
You made me stunned.

249
00:37:09,270 --> 00:37:12,620
How was it? Was my answer clear enough?

250
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:16,320
Yeah

251
00:37:18,460 --> 00:37:20,000
How about one more round?

252
00:37:43,350 --> 00:37:44,890
Hello

253
00:37:47,130 --> 00:37:48,690
Mr. Kiat?

254
00:37:52,010 --> 00:37:55,130
Are you interested in having KengKla join a special boy band project?

255
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:05,590
I'll tell him right away. Thank you.

256
00:38:06,990 --> 00:38:08,400
What did he say?

257
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:14,520
He wants you to join a special boy band project he's working on.

258
00:38:14,730 --> 00:38:15,590
Are you serious?

259
00:38:15,590 --> 00:38:16,450
I am!

260
00:38:27,460 --> 00:38:28,140
Let's celebrate!

261
00:38:28,150 --> 00:38:28,740
Yes!

262
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:29,520
Yes? Let's go!
