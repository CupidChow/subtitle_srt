1
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:29,039
Boys, who's finished with their hair and makeup?

2
00:01:29,039 --> 00:01:31,360
Come by and show me how it turned out, I want to see how neat it look.

3
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:39,720
Because today's event must be outstanding, exceptional, and truly impressive.

4
00:01:59,080 --> 00:01:59,920
Hey.

5
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:01,080
Oh?

6
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:03,960
Hey! How did you get in?

7
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:09,280
I just walked in, saying I'm your friend.

8
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,120
Are you looking for someone?

9
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:22,960
No, I'm not.

10
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:27,640
You're acting a bit odd today

11
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:32,160
Let's fight today.

12
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:34,160
Do your best.

13
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:36,840
Namo.

14
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:41,760
Yes, Namo. I'm calling you. Come over here

15
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,920
I'll be right back.

16
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,800
Let me help.

17
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,720
It's okay.

18
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,400
Kita

19
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,240
Hello.

20
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,560
How are you? Where's your mum?

21
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,840
How did you get here?

22
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:52,440
Eye and Pim mentioned that your mother is sick, so I hurried here.

23
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,040
That would be correct.

24
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,840
She's waiting for surgery,

25
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:06,960
but the doctor mentioned they still couldn't proceed with the procedure.

26
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,560
But I heard it's an urgent surgery. What are we waiting for?

27
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,200
Well,

28
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:19,360
I don't have enough money.

29
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:35,560
You don't have to worry. I'll take care of it.

30
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,520
You called me. What's going on?

31
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,840
I've got something I need your help with

32
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
What do you need help with?

33
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:57,400
I'd like you to do whatever it takes to ruin the Beyond The Star project.

34
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,080
Pardon?

35
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:04,360
I think I made it clear.

36
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,040
What can I do alone?

37
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:17,440
I heard you and Namo were dating.

38
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:23,640
Approaching that side wouldn't be difficult, would it?

39
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,800
Um

40
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:31,960
Is your mother's health better now?

41
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,480
Yes.

42
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,200
Good

43
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:47,840
Then you would help me, wouldn't you?

44
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:08,440
Who has already done their makeup and hair?

45
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:12,560
Please stay still.

46
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:19,880
Because there are so many of you but only one me. It's very chaotic now.

47
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:24,440
So please have mercy on me.

48
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,720
We understand.

49
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:32,760
Kengkla

50
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:33,840
Yeah?

51
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:38,960
Do you think we can really pull it off?

52
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:50,000
Namo, why do you have to worry? We've already come this far

53
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:51,960
Fight on.

54
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:07,240
Boys, listen up. How's everything going? Don't be nervous, just do your best.

55
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:10,880
Don't forget your goals. What are you here for?

56
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:16,920
Don't forget to eat while you're waiting. It'll give you more energy for the performance. Fighting!

57
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,520
Thank you!

58
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:29,800
I hope you won't be ashamed if you lose today.

59
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:35,360
Have you heard the saying, 'Who laughs last, laughs best"?

60
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,360
Anything can happen.

61
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,960
Are you ready?

62
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:24,000
Who are here for Red King?

63
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:34,640
And who are here for Beyond the Star?

64
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:46,320
Alright! I think everybody's ready.

65
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:55,000
If you're ready, let's enjoy the showcase battle between Red King and Beyond the Star!

66
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:39,440
The showcase battle between Red King and Beyond the Star is over.

67
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:43,400
Now, let's hear comments from the commentators.

68
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:47,720
I want to compliment both teams on your performance

69
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:54,800
Both teams have clearly different styles. It's kind of hard to make a comparison.

70
00:13:55,520 --> 00:14:01,640
I like both teams. You're both very good, but I prefer Red King a little bit more.

71
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:04,320
Your talent and confidence shine through.

72
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:09,560
It might be because Red King has more experience, so Red King dominated the stage.

73
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:13,760
For me, I prefer Beyond the Star's performance.

74
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:18,640
Everyone seems happy to perform in front of the audience, adding to the joy of the spectators.

75
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:23,840
I really liked it for both singing and communication.

76
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:28,000
For Beyond the Star, each member did their homework. All maintained a consistent standard in singing levels,

77
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:33,280
with some even surpassing their practice.

78
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:39,240
Red King did great. Benefitting from having more experience.

79
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:43,160
How did you like the performance?

80
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:49,600
I really enjoyed the performance. It was very impressive. They all did great.

81
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:54,800
Wishing both teams luck.

82
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:59,280
Thank you for the commentary

83
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:12,200
And the winning team is!

84
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:30,280
And the winning team is!

85
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:33,960
Red King!

86
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:51,240
Congratulations to the winning team!

87
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:56,920
And for Beyond the Star, you did great today. Keep on fighting!

88
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:17,880
What a pity.

89
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:22,800
We were so close to winning.

90
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:28,080
It's okay. You're already very good.

91
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,560
Here

92
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,240
An award for someone with talent.

93
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:41,760
Thanks.

94
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:46,600
Let's snap a picture for an Instagram story.

95
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,839
Hey, Kengkla. Let's take a picture together.

96
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:17,319
It's okay, you guys can take pictures first.

97
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:43,200
I'll be back.

98
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:49,440
Is anything wrong?

99
00:17:52,120 --> 00:18:01,320
I just want to say that you did very well today. Nothing much.

100
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:07,640
Then I'm leaving now.

101
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:12,760
Take care.

102
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:14,440
I'm off.

103
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:25,520
Namo.

104
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:27,920
Yes?

105
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:29,520
Well

106
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:38,840
Do you still remember our last conversation about what to do when you lose?

107
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,680
I never said I agreed to your offer.

108
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,320
I just mentioned that I would like to think about it first.

109
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:02,040
I'll stay here.

110
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:07,800
I'm here to prove to you that KJ Agency is just as good as any other.

111
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:16,120
Hope you can do what you said.

112
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:17,440
I will be watching.

113
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:27,520
As for you, we need to have a conversation.

114
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:45,320
Shall we go home now?

115
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:49,800
You can go first. I'll head inside and meet Natee.

116
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:50,720
Okay.

117
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:53,920
See you later.

118
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:24,680
We apologise, Ms. Araya, for causing the company to lose face

119
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:29,720
Forget it, it's okay.

120
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:35,720
At least today, everyone showed me determination and dedication.

121
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:43,920
You did very well. I noticed your improvement.

122
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:47,360
I'm very proud of you all today.

123
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:54,800
You must be very tired after the whole day today

124
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:57,840
Thank you.

125
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:14,280
Tonnam, why did you make a mistake in the dance? You didn't seem focused.

126
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,560
I'm sorry.

127
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:25,560
What about you? You stood in the wrong blocking during both rehearsal and performance.

128
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:28,440
Instead of taking responsibility, you only blamed other people.

129
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:33,680
But at least I didn't make a mistake in the dance

130
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:36,200
If that's the case, Mawin also made a mistake. Why don't you go and scold him?

131
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:38,760
And what are you being nosy about?

132
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:46,680
No, stop it!

133
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:49,480
Stop!

134
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:52,680
What the hell are you guys doing?

135
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:55,720
You're fighting like little kids

136
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:02,080
Hey! If you're going to be like this, please go home.

137
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:06,000
Go back and reflect on yourself.

138
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:10,440
Come back when you're more self-aware.

139
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:22,920
Sorry.

140
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,240
Alright, I'm sorry.

141
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:47,880
Are you hungry?

142
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:51,040
Yes, I am.

143
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:54,040
Do you want to have some?

144
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:56,040
No, thanks. I'm currently on a low-carb diet.

145
00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:00,880
It's very delicious. Please give it a try.

146
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,760
If it's so delicious, why don't you have more?

147
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:14,040
Eat properly. Your mouth is all messy.

148
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:16,000
Where?

149
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,440
It's not messy.

150
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,080
Here.

151
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,560
Phupa

152
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:43,320
I cleaned it up for you.

153
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:46,400
Someone will see us.

154
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:51,560
No one's going to see us. They all went home.

155
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:57,600
Let's go somewhere else. It's too risky here.

156
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:05,920
Here is fine.

157
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:31,400
Let me help.

158
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,120
Thank you so much.

159
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:49,520
How is it? I brought you to make merit. Does it make you feel better?

160
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:51,640
I feel nothing.

161
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:53,280
But how?

162
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:54,240
I'm kidding.

163
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:59,520
My overthinking has lessened.

164
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:07,360
We lost, and there's nothing we can do about it anyway. What about you?

165
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:12,400
I feel a whole lot better. Maybe I've just accepted the fact that we lost.

166
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:15,960
And I've got to punch you in the face.

167
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:17,720
Do you want to punch me one more time?

168
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:18,560
Oh, please let me.

169
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:29,480
Tonnam, are you okay?

170
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:33,640
Yes, I'm okay.

171
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:42,720
It's okay. From now on, let's give it another try.

172
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:45,640
Because we started from zero.

173
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:48,800
Now, there are many people notice us.

174
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:52,720
If we continue to improve, we're going to get better.

175
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:54,560
I believe,

176
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:57,600
Come one, let's give it another try.

177
00:32:58,440 --> 00:32:59,520
Come on.

178
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:00,280
Let's do it.

179
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:01,520
Inside the temple?

180
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:02,240
Why not?

181
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:04,480
You're so slow.

182
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:09,400
Do it quietly. One, two ,three "Hey!".

183
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:10,280
Hey.

184
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:12,920
Please smile. Hey.

185
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:14,400
Let's go.

186
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:31,120
Why are you here alone?

187
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:36,480
Are you stressed about something?

188
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:48,120
I think I will withdraw. I might not be able to continue with you guys

189
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:54,120
Why?

190
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:05,360
Do you really think I am suited for this path?

191
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,280
Why do you feel that way?

192
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:17,960
Why do you feel that way?

193
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:24,800
You guys might shine brighter without me in this project.

194
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,159
Don't think like that.

195
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:33,639
I believe in you.

196
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:42,960
Take your time and reconsider, is it a good idea?

197
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:56,679
I've made a decision, and I hope you understand

198
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:06,320
If that's your decision, I respect it.

199
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,720
Hey! What’s wrong with you?

200
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:23,200
I'm truly sorry, sir.

201
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:27,320
Hey, let me handle it. I apologise on behalf of my friend.

202
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:29,840
My friend really didn't mean to.

203
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:44,640
Hey, can we talk?

204
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:47,320
I'm working.

205
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:55,520
I'm sorry about that day and for not believing that your mum was sick.

206
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:59,600
Can you stop talking about this matter?

207
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:06,800
I know you're angry. I'm genuinely sorry.

208
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:11,200
It was my fault for judging you before knowing the truth.

209
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:13,880
I'm truly sorry.

210
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:16,120
You're a deadweight, heard that?

211
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:17,400
It's none of your business.

212
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:58,360
Forgive me, please.

213
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:11,960
You really won't forgive me?

214
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:17,480
I'm working. Can't you see? Just go back.

215
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:24,560
If you won't forgive me, I won't leave.

216
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:34,200
Okay, I forgive you. Are you satisfied now?

217
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:36,600
Yes, I am.

218
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:40,480
Let me do that.

219
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:45,480
Okay, wipe it.

220
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:46,360
Do you want to do everything instead of me?

221
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:54,520
Make yourself at home, Copper.

222
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:58,280
You can put your bag here.

223
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:05,560
What do you want to drink?

224
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:07,760
Just water would be fine.

225
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:10,480
Water? I'll get it for you.

226
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:19,960
The new dance moves are so difficult. Can you memorise them?

227
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:22,560
Yes, I can.

228
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:27,040
Really? How can you memorise it? There were a lot of dance moves

229
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:30,280
If you practise a lot, then you'll memorise it.

230
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:34,760
I can't memorise anything. My brain can't accept new movements.

231
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:36,200
Here's your water.

232
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:37,120
Thank you.

233
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:42,280
Shall we play a game?

234
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:44,080
That sounds fun.

235
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:46,800
Play a game?

236
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:47,680
Yes.

237
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:48,280
What game?

238
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:50,280
The game we used to play.

239
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:53,880
But last time, you lost to me.

240
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:58,280
It's time for a rematch.

241
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:00,280
Let's see.

242
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:04,840
Yes, let's see. The loser will have to go and buy ingredients for the BBQ alone.

243
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:05,840
Really?

244
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:06,640
Really.

245
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:08,120
Then okay.

246
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:10,320
Do you guys even place bets?

247
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:13,160
Of course.
