1
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,720
There are so many new dance moves.

2
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,720
I know, right?

3
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:10,960
I'll practise at home.

4
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,360
I thought you already left.

5
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,400
Um, I think I'll stay here for a little bit more.

6
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:29,080
Alright, then. See you later.

7
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:30,720
I'll go with you

8
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,680
See you tomorrow.

9
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,280
See you.

10
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:42,600
Are you waiting for me?

11
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:47,280
Um, yeah.

12
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,160
I happened to finish early, and I thought it might be a good time for us to go to the temple together.

13
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,960
Aren't you upset with me?

14
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:09,039
I am upset, but I don't think you'll be the one to make up with me.

15
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,040
You already know that.

16
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,160
Yes, I know.

17
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,280
Going to the temple? That's an odd way to make up, don't you think?

18
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,079
Others choose travel for reconciliation.

19
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,640
So, will you go?

20
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,400
Of course, I will.

21
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,440
If you don't start moving soon, I won't be going anymore.

22
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,520
Kengkla, you forgot your backpack.

23
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:14,240
So, do you want to leave now?

24
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:18,160
Um, if there's nothing else to do then we better leave.

25
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,800
Okay, let's go now.

26
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:20,840
Yes.

27
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,480
Are you Kengkla and Namo?

28
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,040
Um, yes.

29
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:30,200
Can I get a quick picture with both of you? I'm a big fan!

30
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:32,600
Sure!

31
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:40,000
One, two, three.

32
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:49,120
Thank you so much. I'm looking forward to the Beyond the Star project.

33
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,800
Thank you very much.

34
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:53,800
I'm rooting for you.

35
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:54,760
Thank you so much.

36
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:58,440
Alright, let's go.

37
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:11,120
Hello, what are you inquiring about?

38
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,000
I want to meet Araya.

39
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:16,040
Have you had a chance to schedule an appointment?

40
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:19,240
If not, meeting with Ms. Araya might be a bit challenging at the moment

41
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,320
Let Araya know Kiat would like to meet.

42
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,120
Please wait a moment

43
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,000
One moment please.

44
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,920
Pick up the phone.

45
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,159
Is it possible?

46
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,560
Sure, please wait a moment; I'll go get her for you

47
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,320
Ms. Araya, excuse me.

48
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,760
How can I help you?

49
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,000
Ms. Araya, mr. Kiat wants to meet you.

50
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,280
Why did he come?

51
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:24,040
I haven't received any information from Pim about having an appointment.

52
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:27,880
Well....

53
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,080
No problem, please go ahead and call him in.

54
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,400
Roger, allow me a moment, please.

55
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,720
Excuse me, Ms. Araya.

56
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,320
Please come in.

57
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:55,320
What's your business?

58
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:03,440
Just stopping by to say hello

59
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:09,040
I just want to know how's the Beyond the Star project going?

60
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,480
None of your business.

61
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:20,160
I just want to swing by and give some encouragement to my ex.

62
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:25,280
I want to know because you took charge of managing this project on your own like this.

63
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:37,080
If you're curious, why not wait and watch the showcase together?

64
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:42,920
If you're inviting me like this, how could I say no?

65
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,720
I like your outfits today.

66
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,120
Really? I just bought it.

67
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,800
Tonnam, don't make mistakes today.

68
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:58,120
Before you tell him, tell yourself first. You always make mistakes.

69
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:58,880
Me?

70
00:06:58,880 --> 00:06:59,400
Yes, you.

71
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:00,720
Sorry.

72
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:11,560
Hello

73
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,680
Why are there so many people here today?

74
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,280
I was just thinking the same.

75
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:28,760
Hello, everyone. Today, we are honored to have guests joining us to watch our showcase

76
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:33,880
The first two individuals are Kiat and Pleng from MChange Entertainment

77
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,040
Hello

78
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:39,320
You guys are already familiar with our next guest.

79
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:41,920
This is Diya, a former Thai-Korean artist.

80
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:44,560
She will be our special commentator for today.

81
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:45,920
Hello.

82
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:50,000
And the last one is Mr. Lee, an investor.

83
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,520
Hello.

84
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:25,160
Overall, your performance was commendable, but there is still room for improvement.

85
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:29,000
You should focus more on details.

86
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:35,720
When singing, pay attention to your vocal balance.

87
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:40,560
I noticed that towards the end of the lines, you had a bit less power, possibly due to breath control.

88
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,120
Diya, would you like to share any comments?

89
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:49,200
Watching everyone's performances today, I can see that you put in your best effort,

90
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,960
but there are many areas where we can continue to work on.

91
00:09:54,640 --> 00:10:02,160
I'm with you. Work on strength, confidence, and unison in your performance.

92
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:07,400
Mr. Lee, still up for the investment after that performance?

93
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:12,920
If you change your mind and invest with me, there's a good chance you'll see a profitable return.

94
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:19,760
By the way, Namo, you're not bad. You've got charm.

95
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,520
Turning you into a star won't be difficult at all

96
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:32,280
I share the same viewpoint. He's gifted. Ms. Araya, you should take really good care of him.

97
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:43,120
But if you reconsider and decide to join MChange, you would be very welcomed

98
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:47,240
I'm confident that I can certainly elevate you into a superstar.

99
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:03,000
Boss, please remain calm.

100
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,400
What do you think you are doing?

101
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:12,280
What do you mean?

102
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:13,840
I am doing nothing.

103
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,840
Keep your unacceptable behaviour to yourself. We won't tolerate it here.

104
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,480
You can't just take crap from me. Unacceptable!

105
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:28,680
If you can't handle taking care of the boy, it reflects on your amateur skills.

106
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:40,960
Araya, see this? You can't even control yourself.

107
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,560
Mr. Kiat, please.

108
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,800
Let's depart, boss.

109
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,000
Relax.

110
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,960
Guys, come here.

111
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:09,080
What happened?

112
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:12,680
Did you hear what I hear?

113
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:14,120
What do you hear?

114
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:18,440
I heard a loud argument coming from that room.

115
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:21,400
We didn't hear anything

116
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:22,640
You didn't.

117
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,080
You've got a good ear.

118
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,680
Like that one animal.

119
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:30,320
Was that a left-handed compliment?

120
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:33,920
Stop!

121
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:34,680
Tonnam, dodge.

122
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:36,680
Can you please stop?

123
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:09,600
Tonnam, wait up.

124
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,520
Me? again?

125
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:27,320
Tonnam, be careful!

126
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:40,760
Get ahold of yourself! What's wrong?

127
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:43,720
Nothing.

128
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,240
Thanks.

129
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:50,320
Are you really okay?

130
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:57,320
I feel like I didn't do well with today's performance.

131
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:01,280
I'd like to go home alone.

132
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,280
Good job, everyone.

133
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:42,240
I gave you a compliment not to spoil you but to encourage you.

134
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:45,120
You did better.

135
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:53,840
But you still gotta step it up, you're kinda behind.

136
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:59,080
Alright, Film. If he did well, just give him a compliment.

137
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:03,320
I only see you scolding him. Do you want him to leave like the others?

138
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:07,400
That's true. Film is always stubborn.

139
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:13,680
Stop babbling. I'm always like this. What does it have to do with you?

140
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:16,080
I only said the truth.

141
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:20,920
Can we just talk about this matter nicely?

142
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,720
Can you both avoid arguing for just one day?

143
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:25,480
Right.

144
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,520
Have you all finished practising?

145
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:35,320
Yes

146
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:36,720
Why do you have to butt in?

147
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:42,880
Are you okay? Do you want to head back now?

148
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:47,160
Something seems off with those two. Is that Twitter rumour true?

149
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:50,560
What rumor? It's not true.

150
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Alright, that's enough.

151
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:56,920
Let's head back and get some rest. We still have a lot to work on tomorrow.

152
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:00,600
We don't have to stay; just go.

153
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:12,120
I'm.. I'm hungry.

154
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,920
Let's grab a bite before heading back.

155
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,400
But I'm sleepy.

156
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:20,400
Oh, you're sleepy?

157
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:21,800
Yes.

158
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:25,440
Alright, let's head back so you can get some rest.

159
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:32,280
Let's go.

160
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:04,359
You mentioned being sleepy, but here you are.

161
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:07,520
Are you hungry?

162
00:17:08,599 --> 00:17:10,160
I can't sleep.

163
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,480
Is there something on your mind?

164
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:21,720
You can always share with me, you know.

165
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:27,000
I'm alright. I just can't fall asleep.

166
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:34,920
Um, then, how about watching a movie together?

167
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:53,720
Nice smell.

168
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,120
Lean on me.

169
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,440
Why?

170
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:21,360
I forgot to tell you. Today, Film complimented me.

171
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:28,120
He said I got better at dancing.

172
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:34,000
Is this true? If it is, pigs will fly today

173
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:38,560
Let me see if the pigs really fly.

174
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:46,360
I think I saw one flying.

175
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:48,840
Just kidding.

176
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:59,400
Thanks to you. You are the one who supports me, so I don't give up.

177
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:06,440
I'm just a small piece of the puzzle.

178
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:12,240
The crucial part is you, my dear.

179
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:15,600
You're the one who never gives up.

180
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:24,400
I want to give you something.

181
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,800
What is it?

182
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:33,040
You have to play a game with me first.

183
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:39,000
Play a game?

184
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:39,600
Yes.

185
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:42,400
And you have to close your eyes.

186
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:44,640
I have to close my eyes?

187
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:48,480
Yes, you do.

188
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:56,200
Do you even have to cover my eyes?

189
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:13,600
Listen to the rules.

190
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,160
Okay.

191
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:22,760
I'll touch a part of your body.

192
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:27,640
And you have to guess what part of my body touches yours.

193
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,440
Alright?

194
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,160
Alright.

195
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:39,000
I'll start now.

196
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,320
Okay.

197
00:20:57,320 --> 00:21:00,760
Wow, it's big. It must be your foot.

198
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:04,640
Ouch! You hit too hard.

199
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:10,840
Okay, I was joking. It's your left hand.

200
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,000
What about..

201
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,600
this?

202
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:28,760
Your right hand.

203
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:38,000
Next.

204
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:48,920
This is surely your mouth.

205
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:00,840
Baby.

206
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,640
Right hand.

207
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:10,640
Good boy.

208
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,120
Next one.

209
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:26,440
Babe.

210
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,800
Do I still have to guess?

211
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:47,280
Your mouth, definitely.

212
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:06,960
Do you want me to take it off? Or do you want to take it off on your own?

213
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:09,600
Please take it off for me.

214
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:15,240
Don't stop.

215
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:58,240
Do you like what I just gave you?

216
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:02,840
Yes, I do.

217
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:11,880
Glad you like it.

218
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:15,520
How can I not like it?

219
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:19,520
Don't you dare say you don't like it.

220
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,040
Are you not tired?

221
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:45,120
What do you think?

222
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:47,840
Yes, you are.

223
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,360
I better sleep.

224
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:17,640
Hey, what are you doing? Don't you go home?

225
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:20,200
Washing dishes. What a weird question. Can't you see?

226
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:23,120
You're being funny.

227
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:38,280
I feel world-weary lately.

228
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,680
What's wrong? You can tell me.

229
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:46,600
My thoughts are muddled.

230
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:56,120
Hey, can I ask you something?

231
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,560
Why are you being serious out of sudden?

232
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:09,400
Do you think the dream we are striving to achieve will be successful?

233
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:14,520
Because we've tried to fight this far.

234
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:21,320
I also have no idea.

235
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:28,280
If it doesn't work out, I might switch gears and try something else.

236
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:31,320
Don't want to spend more time if it's not paying off.

237
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:33,720
We are not teenagers anymore.

238
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:38,960
But you told me you love singing.

239
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:41,320
Yes, I do love singing.

240
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:47,840
But it doesn't mean I have to be in a boy band.

241
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:51,680
I can sing at nightclubs.

242
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:58,240
What about our promise to make it work together? We said we'd succeed side by side, didn't we?

243
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:01,040
So, what's your take on what I should do next?

244
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:05,360
The situation is not the same as before.

245
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:12,040
What if, in the end, things just can't go on? Why push yourself so hard?

246
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:19,840
What about all my daily prayers for our success, just like we promised? I'm putting in the effort, you know?

247
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:22,560
Can't you tough it out a bit longer?

248
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:28,400
Kengkla, I never asked you to do all of that

249
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:43,680
Why? Are you upset with me again?

250
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:51,360
Why are you saying something like that again? Why do you give up so easily?

251
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:54,960
We're both pretty committed to this project, aren't we?

252
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,960
Let's not start a fight just yet, okay?

253
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:00,640
I'm already beat from dancing. Let's not argue, okay?

254
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:05,000
Up to you then. I won't push the conversation any further.

255
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:38,120
The key is to make sure you're practising those basics every day.

256
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:43,760
You have to practise every day, okay?

257
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:45,400
Okay

258
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:48,880
Next time, let's see some better moves, everyone.

259
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:53,640
Thanks

260
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:55,600
Thank you.

261
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:56,760
See you then.

262
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:04,120
Wait.

263
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:05,280
What?

264
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:06,480
Why the rush?

265
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:10,800
I'm in a hurry to see my mom. She's not doing well.

266
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:47,680
Here's your order.

267
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:54,360
Why? Are you surprised?

268
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:56,360
How do you know I'm here?

269
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:59,640
Did you lie about your mom being sick?

270
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:04,400
Lower your voice. When did I ever lie to you?

271
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:07,200
Come out. We need to talk.

272
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:18,280
Is what you told me about your mom untrue?

273
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:20,600
No.

274
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:26,040
Is the reason you're often late to practice because you're secretly working here?

275
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:34,160
Is practicing not important to you at all? Then why are you holding us back?

276
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:34,960
You're being too harsh!

277
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:35,720
What did I say that was wrong?

278
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
You're really being a deadweight. Got that loud and clear?

279
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:43,280
Butt out!

280
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:11,600
Babe, someone might see us.

281
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,000
I missed you.

282
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:18,200
Seriously though, we're practically inseparable. Aren't you getting tired of me yet?

283
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:19,600
Never.

284
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:23,440
I miss you every time I can't see you.

285
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:26,040
Ew, let go of me.

286
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:27,440
Before someone else sees us.

287
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:31,360
Can I kiss you?

288
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:35,440
Why ask all of a sudden?

289
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:39,240
I just feel like kissing.

290
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:43,040
But you never ask.

291
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:52,760
That was enough.

292
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:55,880
Enough. / One more time.

293
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:57,080
Two more times?

294
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:57,600
No.

295
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:58,280
Three?

296
00:33:58,280 --> 00:33:58,760
Enough.

297
00:33:58,760 --> 00:33:59,480
What about four times?

298
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:07,160
What?

299
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:31,199
There is trouble!

300
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:43,520
Boss, please take a look at this.

301
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:58,280
Bring Kengkla and Namo here.

302
00:34:58,680 --> 00:34:59,360
Copy that.

303
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:12,880
Hello

304
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:14,400
Take a seat.

305
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:23,320
Are you two having a fight right now?

306
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:27,520
Why?

307
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:30,400
Look at this.

308
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:46,200
Some not-so-great news just popped up, and it's not ideal for us.

309
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:53,400
If you've got some free time, how about you go live on social media together for a bit? It might help distract from all this news

310
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:57,280
Got it.

311
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:12,000
Hello, everyone. How's everything going?

312
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:12,840
We are doing great.

313
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:14,160
Yes, we are.

314
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:19,520
I checked out all the Twitter trends and made notes of everyone who's sulking.

315
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,400
We've seen everything.

316
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:28,240
There's nothing happening between us. It's just that we have a lot of practice lately.

317
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:31,360
So, we don't have much time to do lives.

318
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:34,920
Right, we practise very hard.

319
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:39,760
You might not see us much on social media, but we're always together, right?

320
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:42,120
Right! That's correct.

321
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:47,520
We're here today because we miss you guys so much. That's the reason.

322
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:49,320
Yes, we want to meet you all.

323
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:55,280
Well, it's time to hit the practice session now. Even though we're not exactly thrilled, we gotta go.

324
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:59,400
Goodbye, everyone! See you later!

325
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:07,760
Kengkla

326
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:14,000
What's going on with you?

327
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,800
Why the silent treatment?

328
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:20,320
I can't read your mind.

329
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:25,360
Do you really need to ask why I'm like this?

330
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:33,640
You are not happy when I said that I would quit being an artist and do something else.

331
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:40,360
I know

332
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:48,000
Why do you have to overthink? A what did I say that's wrong?

333
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:50,640
I'm just stating the truth.

334
00:37:56,320 --> 00:38:01,520
Maybe you should take a careful look at yourself first.

335
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:08,200
I'm completely drained.
