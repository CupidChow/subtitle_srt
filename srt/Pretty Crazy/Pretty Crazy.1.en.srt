Scan and choose your target.

00:00:52,292 --> 00:00:55,378
Aim with precision. Be decisive.

That's how you get what you want.

4
00:01:07,474 --> 00:01:11,061
As you gain experience, your skills grow.

5
00:01:13,396 --> 00:01:15,774
It's simple and clear.

00:01:17,108 --> 00:01:20,445
But life's not a claw machine.

7
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:26,409
It's way more complicated and difficult.

00:01:36,253 --> 00:01:38,421
- Hey!
- Are you messing with me?

11
00:01:38,421 --> 00:01:40,090
If this is your best,
you better look for a new job.

12
00:01:40,090 --> 00:01:41,007
How did you get in this company?

13
00:01:41,007 --> 00:01:42,050
- I knew you were trouble.
- Are you an idiot?

14
00:01:42,050 --> 00:01:44,803
- Do the job you are told to do.
- Fix this by tomorrow.

15
00:01:44,803 --> 00:01:46,513
How did it end up like this?

16
00:01:46,513 --> 00:01:48,807
Stick it out, man. If you quit, then what?

17
00:01:48,807 --> 00:01:51,434
It wasn't even your fault.

18
00:01:59,192 --> 00:02:02,070
No matter how much I think...

00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:06,074

00:02:29,306 --> 00:02:31,349
Look how she bosses people around.

00:02:31,349 --> 00:02:34,811
Don't buy from her bakery.

25
00:02:34,811 --> 00:02:36,980
There's a bakery here?

26
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:38,982

No, I don't get food delivered.

29
00:03:12,098 --> 00:03:15,226
I pick up side dishes
to have with rice at home.

30
00:03:16,853 --> 00:03:20,982
Of course, I clean the place!

31
00:03:20,982 --> 00:03:24,152
I wash the blankets and clear the dust, too.

Mom, don't you trust me?

34
00:04:39,269 --> 00:04:41,688
She was so beautiful.

35
00:04:44,023 --> 00:04:47,569
If angels were real, they'd look like her.

39

You knew my daughter lived below you.

106
00:12:06,674 --> 00:12:08,175
You tailed her, didn't you?

107
00:12:08,175 --> 00:12:11,846
No. I didn't follow her.

108
00:12:12,638 --> 00:12:17,184
I was just getting milk and…

109
00:12:18,102 --> 00:12:21,898
I thought she was being attacked by a creep.

110
00:12:24,275 --> 00:12:30,489
Have you seen her at night before?

111
00:12:30,489 --> 00:12:32,700
No, never.

- I have.
- Thought so.

114

I saw her in the elevator.
Thought she was possessed.

115
00:12:43,044 --> 00:12:45,463
I thought she was drunk. She attacked me.

- Yes, sir.

- Enough already! - I swear I'll crush it.

I asked you to watch her,
but you already snuck out?

00:17:59,276 --> 00:18:02,529
- Yes.
- And your dad's a high school principal?

186
00:18:02,529 --> 00:18:04,365
They're in the States now, with my sister.

187
00:18:04,365 --> 00:18:05,574
That's fine.

188
00:18:05,574 --> 00:18:07,534
She just had a baby...

189
00:18:08,827 --> 00:18:12,873
Any criminal record?

190
00:18:12,873 --> 00:18:16,377
No! I'm not that kind of person.

191
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:20,297
You like sports?

192
00:18:21,423 --> 00:18:24,218
Not really, but I did taekwondo.

193
00:18:24,218 --> 00:18:25,511
Taekwondo?

194
00:18:25,511 --> 00:18:27,179
And...

195
00:18:27,179 --> 00:18:29,682
Hapkido, kendo...

196
00:18:32,810 --> 00:18:36,272
Table tennis, tennis, badminton,

197
00:18:36,272 --> 00:18:39,316
soccer, basketball, volleyball,

198
00:18:39,316 --> 00:18:42,319
and rowing.

199
00:18:42,319 --> 00:18:45,197
I rowed before the army.

200
00:18:45,197 --> 00:18:48,659
But you don't specialize?

201
00:18:48,659 --> 00:18:49,952
I guess not.

202
00:18:49,952 --> 00:18:53,747
Did you mess up and got fired at your last job?

203
00:18:53,747 --> 00:18:56,250
No, I quit.

204
00:18:56,250 --> 00:19:01,964
It wasn't right for me
to the point it was hurting.

205
00:19:01,964 --> 00:19:05,592
Everyone's hurting.
The whole country's hurting.

206
00:19:05,592 --> 00:19:08,721
Move aside.

207
00:19:08,721 --> 00:19:11,056
Hey, Mister.

208
00:19:11,056 --> 00:19:12,057
Me?

209
00:19:12,057 --> 00:19:14,184
You're hurting, right? How'd you get hurt?

210
00:19:14,184 --> 00:19:15,811
From work.

211
00:19:15,811 --> 00:19:19,690
See? Work hurts us all.

212
00:19:19,690 --> 00:19:22,234
Why are you following us?

213
00:19:22,234 --> 00:19:26,113
About that...

214
00:19:27,531 --> 00:19:33,871
Your daughter acts so odd every time,
like a different person.

215
00:19:33,871 --> 00:19:36,081
I got curious.

216
00:19:36,081 --> 00:19:37,333
Oh yeah?

217
00:19:37,333 --> 00:19:42,796
It won't happen again. I'm not a creep.

218
00:19:42,796 --> 00:19:44,882
Sorry.

219
00:19:48,719 --> 00:19:50,763
Chin up.

220
00:19:50,763 --> 00:19:52,598
Look at me.

221
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:59,188
Listen to this carefully.

222
00:20:00,689 --> 00:20:02,232
Close the curtains.

223
00:20:24,755 --> 00:20:29,510
My daughter's quite different from most people.

224
00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:34,056
Hard to believe, but she is...

225
00:20:34,056 --> 00:20:35,974
possessed.

226
00:20:37,518 --> 00:20:39,061
Listen.

227
00:20:39,061 --> 00:20:44,108
She's a demon. Born with one inside her.

228
00:20:44,108 --> 00:20:52,449
Every night at 2 A.M., it takes over.
Lasts about three hours.

229
00:20:52,449 --> 00:20:54,410
You're the one they got?

230
00:20:54,410 --> 00:20:55,661
Oh, no, no.

231
00:20:55,661 --> 00:20:57,246
He's our neighbor. Nice guy.

232
00:20:57,246 --> 00:20:59,832
- I'll crush your damn skull!
- He looks obedient, right?

233
00:20:59,832 --> 00:21:01,667
It's just for a few days.

234
00:21:01,667 --> 00:21:05,087
I'm not lying. You saw it yourself.

235
00:21:05,087 --> 00:21:08,549
It's not split personality.

236
00:21:09,466 --> 00:21:13,470
It's an ancient family curse.

237
00:21:13,470 --> 00:21:19,184
If we don't offer up what it wants,
who knows what it'll do?

238
00:21:19,184 --> 00:21:25,858
It loves moonlight.
So, it walks around at night.

239
00:21:25,858 --> 00:21:31,405
Seon Ji has no idea that she's possessed.

240
00:21:31,405 --> 00:21:36,785
If she finds out, she won't be able to go on.

241
00:21:37,453 --> 00:21:39,955
Did you hit your head, too?

242
00:21:39,955 --> 00:21:42,541
Stop eavesdropping. Go away.

243
00:21:42,541 --> 00:21:46,086
We are discussing a book. Something for kids.

244
00:21:46,086 --> 00:21:47,254
You're hurt. Go lie down.

245
00:21:47,254 --> 00:21:50,424
What children's story has demons in it?

246
00:21:50,424 --> 00:21:52,426
I'll get going.

247
00:21:52,426 --> 00:21:55,888
Gil Gu, please. Help us.

248
00:21:55,888 --> 00:21:57,055
Sir, I...

249
00:21:57,055 --> 00:21:59,183
Gil Gu!

250
00:21:59,183 --> 00:22:01,477
Thank you.

251
00:22:01,477 --> 00:22:03,145
Sir?

252
00:22:20,454 --> 00:22:22,331
Do I...

253
00:22:23,749 --> 00:22:26,335
look like a demon to you?

254
00:22:26,335 --> 00:22:29,338
No, not at all.

255
00:22:29,338 --> 00:22:34,051
I'm not just any demon. I'm a high-ranking one.

256
00:22:34,051 --> 00:22:41,058
Could someone lowly like you
even see my horns or wings?

257
00:22:41,058 --> 00:22:46,021
These wings here.

258
00:22:46,021 --> 00:22:48,565
See them?

259
00:22:53,695 --> 00:22:56,198
What's that smell?

260
00:23:03,121 --> 00:23:06,124
Stinks like rotting wounds.

261
00:23:09,628 --> 00:23:14,967
What are you searching for so desperately?

262
00:23:16,385 --> 00:23:17,553
Sorry?

263
00:23:17,553 --> 00:23:21,431
Hit the nail on the head? Feel ashamed?
Mad? Let it all out.

264
00:23:21,431 --> 00:23:26,436
You humans are evil inside.
Show who you really are.

265
00:23:29,064 --> 00:23:31,817
I don't think I can handle this.

266
00:23:31,817 --> 00:23:36,405
You should take your daughter
to a specialized hospital.

267
00:23:36,405 --> 00:23:47,708
She pokes at the deep stuff, right?
The things you hide away.

268
00:23:47,708 --> 00:23:50,043
That's because she's a demon.

269
00:23:50,043 --> 00:23:53,839
She loves messing with hearts.

270
00:23:57,551 --> 00:24:04,016
If it's too much,
just protect her like a caregiver.

271
00:24:04,016 --> 00:24:07,644
I'll make it worth your while.

272
00:24:07,644 --> 00:24:11,940
Besides, I wouldn't trust
just anyone with my daughter.

273
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:17,362
We're neighbors, after all.
Only one wall between us.

274
00:24:18,030 --> 00:24:22,868
You're a good man.

275
00:24:23,535 --> 00:24:26,580
What do you do during the day?

276
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:30,626
Hi, I'm Lee Gil Gu. Nice to meet you.

277
00:24:30,626 --> 00:24:36,757
I've heard about you. I'm Jung Seon Ji.

278
00:24:42,554 --> 00:24:45,932
Hi, I'm Jung Ara. Let's start your training.

279
00:24:52,397 --> 00:24:57,361
Feels weird, right?
You'll get used to it in time.

280
00:24:57,361 --> 00:25:03,200
It's a lot, I know. Trust me, I get it.

281
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,577
She really doesn't remember?

282
00:25:05,577 --> 00:25:09,539
Nothing about turning into a demon.

283
00:25:09,539 --> 00:25:13,752
But unlike her, the demon remembers everything.

284
00:25:16,755 --> 00:25:18,590
You still don't believe it.

285
00:25:20,967 --> 00:25:23,595
How can I believe this?

286
00:25:23,595 --> 00:25:28,642
Like it or not, you will.
We've never hired an outsider before.

287
00:25:28,642 --> 00:25:32,771
At first, I was at a loss.

288
00:25:32,771 --> 00:25:34,398
Then my quick wits came up with this plan.

289
00:25:34,398 --> 00:25:36,274
What do you do for work?

290
00:25:36,274 --> 00:25:39,736
I'm taking a break now.

291
00:25:39,736 --> 00:25:42,239
You're jobless.

292
00:25:42,239 --> 00:25:46,910
And you live upstairs. I thought, perfect.

293
00:25:46,910 --> 00:25:48,328
I'll be counting on you.

294
00:25:48,328 --> 00:25:51,707
Hello, I'm Lee Gil Gu. Nice to meet you.

295
00:25:51,707 --> 00:25:55,377
I'm so happy to work here.

296
00:25:57,796 --> 00:26:00,340
When did I say that?

297
00:26:01,174 --> 00:26:04,594
I saw everything. Fool.

298
00:26:06,888 --> 00:26:13,103
Is this some dumb prank?
A YouTube secret camera?

299
00:26:13,103 --> 00:26:15,731
Someone filming me in hiding?

300
00:26:15,731 --> 00:26:18,734
Where's the camera? See, I knew it.

301
00:26:18,734 --> 00:26:20,318
Where is it?

302
00:26:33,081 --> 00:26:37,377
Who do you think you are?
Who'd want to see you get punked?

303
00:26:40,088 --> 00:26:42,257
Feel them. Touch them. Grab them.

304
00:26:42,257 --> 00:26:43,633
What are you doing?

305
00:26:43,633 --> 00:26:46,428
It's okay. Just hold them.

306
00:26:47,387 --> 00:26:48,805
Go on, do it.

307
00:26:48,805 --> 00:26:50,307
Please stop this.

308
00:26:50,307 --> 00:26:52,809
She's asleep. This is between you and me.

309
00:26:52,809 --> 00:26:55,395
Touch them. Feel them.

310
00:27:04,946 --> 00:27:09,826
I think I like you.

311
00:27:09,826 --> 00:27:16,416
Don't forget. It's a demon.
It'll try everything to break you.

312
00:27:16,416 --> 00:27:19,920
If you give in, it wins and it'll get stronger.

313
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:28,011
I really like you, Gil Gu.

314
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:32,557
Lies.

315
00:27:32,557 --> 00:27:34,810
Bullshit!

316
00:27:34,810 --> 00:27:37,395
No one falls for me that fast.

317
00:27:37,395 --> 00:27:39,439
That's never happened.

318
00:27:39,439 --> 00:27:42,234
I'm not falling for this.

319
00:27:43,568 --> 00:27:45,028
All right.

320
00:27:50,242 --> 00:27:51,701
Fonfon.

321
00:27:51,701 --> 00:27:53,912
Welcome.

322
00:27:53,912 --> 00:27:55,831
Welcome.

323
00:27:55,831 --> 00:27:59,251
Cashier boy! See this White Fonfon Chiffon?

324
00:27:59,251 --> 00:28:01,127
Only stock this from now.

325
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,505
And green mint chocolate...

326
00:28:03,505 --> 00:28:07,759
Don't put that out.
Even demons would freak at the taste!

327
00:28:07,759 --> 00:28:11,638
What are you doing? And why talk down to me?

328
00:28:11,638 --> 00:28:12,722
- What? Jeez.
- I'm really sorry.

329
00:28:12,722 --> 00:28:14,558
She's my sister. She has mental issues.

330
00:28:14,558 --> 00:28:15,559
Chop chop. Hurry up!

331
00:28:15,559 --> 00:28:18,103
Is this your first day or something?

332
00:28:18,103 --> 00:28:19,896
Move it, cashier boy!

333
00:28:20,856 --> 00:28:24,109
Ugh. Seriously.

334
00:29:03,690 --> 00:29:06,651
Even real demons wouldn't go that far.

335
00:29:07,986 --> 00:29:10,989
I have a question.

336
00:29:12,365 --> 00:29:16,036
What's a demon doing in Seon Ji's body?

337
00:29:20,165 --> 00:29:26,755
Her ancestor wronged me gravely.
An unforgivable sin.

338
00:29:26,755 --> 00:29:29,174
And she's bearing the punishment.

339
00:29:31,051 --> 00:29:35,680
How long will it last? Forever, of course.

340
00:29:36,848 --> 00:29:41,311
So, obey me completely. Otherwise...

341
00:29:41,311 --> 00:29:45,023
Even I can't guarantee what I'll do to her.

342
00:29:46,691 --> 00:29:50,236
No way. That's insane.

343
00:30:02,207 --> 00:30:06,461
Is she kidding me?

344
00:30:11,675 --> 00:30:13,593
What's with the cicada?

345
00:30:14,719 --> 00:30:17,472
Okay, okay. You're a real demon.

346
00:30:17,472 --> 00:30:21,226
I believe you. Please stop.

347
00:30:24,854 --> 00:30:29,025
Cut the sample bread all the way like this.

348
00:30:31,653 --> 00:30:33,405
What?

349
00:30:34,656 --> 00:30:36,658
Nothing.

350
00:30:38,410 --> 00:30:40,412
You can speak casually, too.

351
00:30:40,412 --> 00:30:45,667
You do it with Ara. It'll help us get closer.

352
00:30:47,627 --> 00:30:52,716
All right. I'll do that.

353
00:30:54,009 --> 00:30:55,552
Okay.

354
00:30:58,179 --> 00:31:02,183
I have class now. See you later.

355
00:31:03,768 --> 00:31:06,563
- Keep cutting.
- Got it.

356
00:31:06,563 --> 00:31:07,814
Take care.

357
00:31:07,814 --> 00:31:09,232
Okay.

358
00:31:12,110 --> 00:31:16,322
You want us to get close?

359
00:31:18,033 --> 00:31:20,368
Me, too.

360
00:31:49,439 --> 00:31:51,941
That's all you got?

361
00:31:53,401 --> 00:31:55,153
Harder.

362
00:31:55,904 --> 00:31:57,697
Harder!

363
00:32:11,795 --> 00:32:15,590
Why is she going around in circles?

364
00:32:19,135 --> 00:32:22,931
Can you come another time?

365
00:32:33,399 --> 00:32:36,986
Really? All sold out?
Look me in the eyes, cashier boy.

366
00:32:36,986 --> 00:32:39,823
I said it's all gone.

367
00:32:41,950 --> 00:32:45,120
I don't have long to live.

You dare lie to me, cashier boy?

370
00:33:20,738 --> 00:33:23,575
- He's a good kid.
- Checkmate!

371
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:47,348
What?

372
00:33:51,728 --> 00:33:55,523
You can switch to this look instantly?

373
00:33:56,566 --> 00:33:59,110
Only top demons can do it.

374
00:33:59,110 --> 00:34:01,529
You look so nice. So pretty.

375
00:34:01,529 --> 00:34:03,489

376
00:34:03,489 --> 00:34:04,866
Come on, let's go.

377
00:34:04,866 --> 00:34:06,993
Here. Look at these stocks.

378
00:34:06,993 --> 00:34:08,953
Pick one that will go to the moon.

379
00:34:16,628 --> 00:34:18,963
Please.

380
00:34:43,905 --> 00:34:50,078
In the name of the Father,
the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.

381
00:34:52,705 --> 00:34:57,669
Come out of that body and perish!

382
00:35:01,673 --> 00:35:04,801
I don't think so. Because I don't want to.

383
00:35:04,801 --> 00:35:08,054
Get out, dammit!

384
00:35:08,054 --> 00:35:09,722

for the rest of her life?

00:35:19,190 --> 00:35:20,817
I don't know.

389
00:35:20,817 --> 00:35:24,237
Anyway, you need to be tougher with her.

390
00:35:24,237 --> 00:35:25,905
Human or demon,

391
00:35:25,905 --> 00:35:29,701
show weakness and they'll walk all over you.

392
00:35:29,701 --> 00:35:34,664
How do you manage that?
You dropped honorifics, too.

393
00:35:34,664 --> 00:35:40,378
She challenged me to a bet,
probably out of boredom.

394
00:35:40,378 --> 00:35:42,964
Said she'd do me any favor if I won.

395
00:35:49,804 --> 00:35:51,306
Poof!

396
00:35:51,306 --> 00:35:53,266
What the heck?

397
00:35:53,266 --> 00:35:56,185
She still doesn't know how she lost to me.

398
00:35:56,185 --> 00:35:59,856
She hasn't asked me to bet since. Idiot.

399
00:36:01,107 --> 00:36:06,738
A bet that big,
and all you did was drop honorifics?

400
00:36:06,738 --> 00:36:10,199
Yeah. Why?

401
00:36:10,199 --> 00:36:11,993
Want to bet?

402
00:36:11,993 --> 00:36:16,080
Pick a toy. I'll win in three tries.

403
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:17,707
And if you do?

404
00:36:18,833 --> 00:36:23,087
You leave her. For good.

405
00:36:25,548 --> 00:36:29,010
All right, all right, fine.

406
00:36:29,010 --> 00:36:37,310
Then tell me how to kick you out of her.

407
00:36:37,310 --> 00:36:42,023
And I drop honorifics, too?

408
00:36:45,276 --> 00:36:47,695
If you lose...

409
00:36:47,695 --> 00:36:53,826

411

No backing out.

412
00:37:20,311 --> 00:37:23,106
All right. Now, please tell me.

413
00:37:23,106 --> 00:37:27,568
I mean, tell me.

414
00:37:27,568 --> 00:37:31,406
Tell me how to get you
out of Seon Ji's body for good.

All right, all right. I'll tell you.

418
00:37:41,833 --> 00:37:43,960
Listen carefully.

419
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:46,796
Say my name and tell me
to get out of this body three times.

420
00:37:46,796 --> 00:37:49,465
I'll leave right away.

Yep.

Watching over you even in dreams.

It's not a person.

465
00:40:56,235 --> 00:40:58,195
Feels more like a dog.

466
00:40:58,195 --> 00:41:05,119
A stray that follows me. Keeps trailing me.

467
00:41:06,912 --> 00:41:10,708

What? Crossing the river?

What are you saying?

508
00:44:21,941 --> 00:44:25,653
Don't just watch. Save her. Please!

509
00:44:47,967 --> 00:44:53,597
This morning at 3 A.M.,
a woman in her 20s jumped off Gunho Bridge.

I found myself cheering.

end up in the Han River?

515
00:45:11,782 --> 00:45:12,992
Why?

516
00:45:12,992 --> 00:45:17,955
She threw a fit. Sick of being stuck here.

517
00:45:17,955 --> 00:45:23,127
You know the trouble I had
drying her hair and clothes?

518
00:45:23,127 --> 00:45:26,297
I should've told you
not to get her near any waterfront.

519
00:45:26,297 --> 00:45:29,466
Did Seon Ji get trained to swim?

520
00:45:29,466 --> 00:45:31,594

begged on his knees.

Said Korea lost a future gold medal.

523
00:45:37,850 --> 00:45:41,645
But you, punk... I trusted you with her.

524
00:45:41,645 --> 00:45:46,817
You backstab me right after I'm discharged?

525
00:45:46,817 --> 00:45:50,070

- Be safe.

532
00:46:04,376 --> 00:46:06,921
Seon Ji's unbelievable.

533
00:46:06,921 --> 00:46:12,134
Even after all that ruckus,
she isn't skipping classes.

534
00:46:12,134 --> 00:46:16,180
French class, right?
Maybe she wants to study abroad.

535
00:46:16,180 --> 00:46:17,890
Yep.

536
00:46:18,807 --> 00:46:24,355
She's eyed a baking school in France for years.

537
00:46:25,606 --> 00:46:29,109
Uncle and I act supportive for now

538
00:46:29,109 --> 00:46:30,986
but man, how do we discourage her eventually?

539
00:46:30,986 --> 00:46:33,739
It's like a ticking bomb.

540
00:46:37,660 --> 00:46:40,871
Why are you so surprised?

541
00:46:40,871 --> 00:46:43,791
What are you doing here, Gil Gu?

542
00:46:43,791 --> 00:46:45,042
Huh?

543
00:46:45,042 --> 00:46:50,089
Didn't know this place existed.
Good spot for a walk.

00:46:50,089 --> 00:46:51,590
Yeah.

545
00:46:55,594 --> 00:46:57,012
Gil Gu.

546
00:46:57,012 --> 00:46:58,097
Yeah?

547
00:46:58,097 --> 00:47:01,225
What did Dad ask of you at this hour?

548
00:47:01,225 --> 00:47:08,357
Never mind. I misunderstood.

549
00:47:13,278 --> 00:47:16,907
Aren't you sleepy?

550
00:47:19,284 --> 00:47:25,749
Today's my mom's memorial day.
Maybe that's why I couldn't sleep.

551
00:47:26,583 --> 00:47:28,961
Oh.

552
00:47:28,961 --> 00:47:33,716
She passed when I was eight.

553
00:47:34,842 --> 00:47:39,263
I tried to forget how she suffered.

554
00:47:39,263 --> 00:47:47,271
But today, I remember her smile.
And her scent when she hugged me.

555
00:47:51,442 --> 00:47:53,152
Sorry. I got all gloomy.

556
00:47:53,152 --> 00:47:58,532
No. If you want to talk, I'm all ears.

557
00:47:58,532 --> 00:48:04,163
I'm really good at listening.
It's one of my few talents.

558
00:48:05,330 --> 00:48:06,999
Okay.

559
00:48:26,018 --> 00:48:29,146
Shall we head back now?

560
00:48:31,607 --> 00:48:37,780
Since we're out, shall we go a bit farther?

561
00:49:57,442 --> 00:49:59,653
So, your feelings are serious.

562
00:50:08,412 --> 00:50:12,040
Put your feet down or I'll whoop your ass.

563
00:50:12,833 --> 00:50:14,585
Hey.

564
00:50:14,585 --> 00:50:16,128
Boo!

565
00:50:24,094 --> 00:50:25,470
You were lying the whole time?

566
00:50:25,470 --> 00:50:28,390
"Gil Gu, what are you doing here?"

567
00:50:28,390 --> 00:50:34,146
"If you want to talk, I'm all ears.
I'm really good at listening."

568
00:50:36,565 --> 00:50:40,194
I played along.
You think I can't tell you apart?

569
00:50:43,614 --> 00:50:47,409
You gonna stick with her forever?
Don't you feel bad for her?

570
00:50:47,409 --> 00:50:50,704
She can't even sleep right.
She'll never study abroad.

571
00:50:50,704 --> 00:50:54,583
Can't you stop already? Please.

572
00:50:54,583 --> 00:50:58,754
Oh là là ! Non, je ne vais pas!

573
00:51:00,422 --> 00:51:04,760
You've never seen real pity.

574
00:51:04,760 --> 00:51:07,596
I told you how you can end this.

575
00:51:07,596 --> 00:51:10,265
Say my name and tell me
to leave this body three times.

576
00:51:10,265 --> 00:51:11,808
I'll leave right away.

577
00:51:11,808 --> 00:51:13,852
There's no other way?

578
00:51:13,852 --> 00:51:17,814
Take me on the bouncy.

579
00:51:17,814 --> 00:51:20,359
You mean trampoline?

580
00:51:20,359 --> 00:51:22,236
Yeah. The bouncy.

581
00:51:22,236 --> 00:51:24,446
If I take you, you'll leave?

582
00:51:26,990 --> 00:51:30,202
Put your heart into making me happy.

583
00:51:30,202 --> 00:51:37,793
If you do that, I'll cut my time by that much.

584
00:51:37,793 --> 00:51:42,256
Then who knows? Maybe one day I'll vanish.

585
00:51:43,382 --> 00:51:46,426
Hold on. Let me check if there's one open.

586
00:51:47,135 --> 00:51:48,887
I'll take you on the bouncy for sure.

587
00:51:48,887 --> 00:51:52,724
What else? Name it.

588
00:51:52,724 --> 00:51:54,893
Bouncy…

589
00:52:01,692 --> 00:52:03,860
Want to go to the beach?

590
00:52:08,156 --> 00:52:11,618
Let's do it. Why not?

591
00:52:11,618 --> 00:52:15,706
But you'll see nothing in the dark.

592
00:52:15,706 --> 00:52:20,585
Then we go during the day.

593
00:52:20,585 --> 00:52:22,421
During the day?

594
00:52:27,050 --> 00:52:28,719
How?

595
00:52:30,053 --> 00:52:38,061
I haven't been to the beach in forever.
Would've been nice with Ara.

596
00:52:38,061 --> 00:52:41,898
How bad is her cold?

597
00:52:41,898 --> 00:52:48,322
Just a light one. Wow, it's vast.

598
00:52:54,995 --> 00:52:59,207
Seon Ji, why are you crying?

599
00:53:01,209 --> 00:53:04,338
Oh, what's this?

600
00:53:05,922 --> 00:53:08,508
Must be the wind.

601
00:53:10,010 --> 00:53:13,513
Can you take a picture of me?

602
00:53:13,513 --> 00:53:16,600
One, two, three.

603
00:53:17,601 --> 00:53:21,772
Got it. Let me show you.

604
00:53:24,524 --> 00:53:27,778
Only one, huh?

605
00:53:37,412 --> 00:53:41,249
Have you tried this?
Apparently they're going viral.

606
00:53:41,249 --> 00:53:45,754
Mint chocolate or plain. Choose one.

607
00:53:53,053 --> 00:54:00,435
This is so nice.
Oh, I've been meaning to ask you...

608
00:54:00,435 --> 00:54:04,231
It might sound weird but...

609
00:54:04,231 --> 00:54:08,151
did we ever watch a movie?

610
00:54:19,788 --> 00:54:27,379
About the movies that night...
You were lying from the start, right?

611
00:54:27,379 --> 00:54:30,757
I thought you could tell us apart.
Guess not.

612
00:54:34,511 --> 00:54:39,307
Today's trip to the beach...
How much time off is that?

613
00:54:39,307 --> 00:54:42,436
An hour? Two?

614
00:54:44,354 --> 00:54:48,066
Five minutes. I'm being generous.

615
00:54:48,066 --> 00:54:53,530
Five? Just five minutes?

616
00:54:54,573 --> 00:54:59,411
Did I enjoy it? No. If anyone did, it was you.

617
00:54:59,411 --> 00:55:04,624
I drove for four hours. I'm wiped out.

618
00:55:04,624 --> 00:55:09,296
Cut me some slack. Give me more time off.

619
00:55:11,423 --> 00:55:13,842
What's wrong?

620
00:55:13,842 --> 00:55:16,761
Why is everyone so dying to get rid of me?

621
00:55:18,430 --> 00:55:24,311
I said to make me happy sincerely,
not sincerely try to get rid of me.

622
00:55:31,401 --> 00:55:33,778
Did you forget who I am?

623
00:56:59,739 --> 00:57:01,825
Here.

624
00:57:01,825 --> 00:57:03,910
Here, rinse your mouth.

625
00:57:12,794 --> 00:57:15,130
Hold still.

626
00:57:15,130 --> 00:57:17,924
At least dust off the dirt.

627
00:57:19,301 --> 00:57:21,845
What if you get sick?

628
00:57:30,312 --> 00:57:38,069
Okay, I'll make you happy sincerely.
You keep your word.

629
00:57:38,903 --> 00:57:40,655
Here goes.

630
00:57:51,791 --> 00:57:54,419
Hey! My throat!

631
00:58:06,056 --> 00:58:07,682
Thank you.

632
00:58:45,303 --> 00:58:47,013
What the hell?

633
00:58:47,013 --> 00:58:49,474
This is how to have fun.

634
00:58:49,474 --> 00:58:51,935
How dare you! Stop now!

635
00:58:51,935 --> 00:58:53,603
- I'll show you real fun.
- Stop it! Cut it out.

636
00:58:53,603 --> 00:58:55,730
This is way more fun.

637
00:59:33,977 --> 00:59:35,854
Where are we?

638
00:59:35,854 --> 00:59:38,732
You like flowers, don't you?

639
00:59:38,732 --> 00:59:41,526
Think a demon likes this crap?

640
00:59:50,869 --> 00:59:52,996
Wow. What's this?

641
00:59:54,247 --> 00:59:55,498
Smile a little.

642
00:59:55,498 --> 00:59:58,251
How dare you tell a demon to smile?

643
00:59:59,169 --> 01:00:03,965
I thought a top-tier demon could do anything.

644
01:00:03,965 --> 01:00:08,428
Guess posing and smiling isn't one of them.

645
01:00:09,387 --> 01:00:10,972
What?

646
01:00:14,100 --> 01:00:17,145
That's good. Great! Gimme more.

647
01:00:17,145 --> 01:00:21,274
Nice! Yes. Something else now.

648
01:00:21,274 --> 01:00:23,526
No. Don't do that. Stop.

649
01:00:23,526 --> 01:00:26,029
One, two, three.

650
01:00:36,831 --> 01:00:40,710
See? Looks great. Like it?

651
01:00:41,503 --> 01:00:45,465
That's not the real me. What's to like?

652
01:00:45,465 --> 01:00:49,803
My true form is hundred times more beautiful.

653
01:00:49,803 --> 01:00:51,805
If you saw me, you'd go blind.

654
01:00:51,805 --> 01:01:00,104
I had huge eyes, a sharp nose, horns.

655
01:01:00,104 --> 01:01:03,983
Famous as a beautiful demon. Look!

656
01:01:07,445 --> 01:01:13,243
I'd definitely go blind.

657
01:01:16,287 --> 01:01:20,792
If you were that famous,
everyone must've known your name.

658
01:01:21,876 --> 01:01:24,504
What did they call you?

659
01:01:25,505 --> 01:01:29,133
They called me this.

660
01:01:29,133 --> 01:01:33,721
Her surname is Nigh, name is Strye.

661
01:01:33,721 --> 01:01:38,518
Nigh Strye! I command you!
Leave that body immediately!

662
01:01:38,518 --> 01:01:43,773
I command you, Nigh Strye...
Leave that body at once.

663
01:01:43,773 --> 01:01:46,484
Keep going. Three times.

664
01:01:49,028 --> 01:01:51,322
Nigh Strye...

665
01:01:51,322 --> 01:01:55,577
30 minutes, Gil Gu!

666
01:01:55,577 --> 01:01:57,370
Well done, son.

667
01:01:57,370 --> 01:02:03,626
You achieved something I couldn't
after buying her a hundred outfits.

668
01:02:03,626 --> 01:02:08,006
Man, I liked you from the start.

669
01:02:08,006 --> 01:02:11,676
While you're at it,
just get rid of that demon for good.

670
01:02:11,676 --> 01:02:13,887
Yes, I will. I'll try.

671
01:02:13,887 --> 01:02:17,682
- Good.
- She cut down 30 minutes just for that?

672
01:02:17,682 --> 01:02:20,143
She really liked the bouncy.

673
01:02:20,143 --> 01:02:22,395
That's where I made the biggest cut.

674
01:02:24,188 --> 01:02:27,692
Let's get rid of her for good tonight.

675
01:02:29,777 --> 01:02:33,781
We'll party like crazy. Let's go wild.

676
01:02:33,781 --> 01:02:35,033
What's your name?

677
01:02:35,033 --> 01:02:36,492
Me?

678
01:02:36,492 --> 01:02:39,329
It's bum-ba-bum, Lee Hee Bum.

679
01:02:39,329 --> 01:02:41,456
- Shall we?
- Go, go.

680
01:02:41,456 --> 01:02:42,999
Let's go!

681
01:02:46,836 --> 01:02:48,171
What's wrong with you?

682
01:02:48,171 --> 01:02:51,925
Answer me! What eyeliner do you use?

683
01:02:51,925 --> 01:02:54,093
It's Devil's Eye from Lily Brown.

684
01:02:54,802 --> 01:02:57,347
Sorry. I'm sorry.

685
01:02:57,347 --> 01:02:59,557
Stick close to me, okay?

686
01:03:42,558 --> 01:03:45,228
What are you doing?

687
01:03:45,228 --> 01:03:47,230
Who might you be?

688
01:03:47,897 --> 01:03:50,900
I'm... her boyfriend.

689
01:04:06,207 --> 01:04:08,001
Are you okay?

690
01:04:10,586 --> 01:04:14,132
Why's your hand shaking so much?

691
01:04:15,758 --> 01:04:19,012
Because my boyfriend's hand is so warm.

692
01:04:33,109 --> 01:04:35,903
When did they get so close?

693
01:04:37,864 --> 01:04:38,990
Beats me.

694
01:04:38,990 --> 01:04:44,912
Ara's quirky, but she makes friends
and boyfriends easily.

695
01:04:44,912 --> 01:04:47,749
Maybe it's her honesty.

696
01:04:49,375 --> 01:04:51,419
What about you?

697
01:04:51,419 --> 01:04:54,005
Not seeing anyone?

698
01:04:54,005 --> 01:05:01,179
It takes more than just heart.
I need to say how I feel.

699
01:05:02,638 --> 01:05:05,892
I tend to overthink.

700
01:05:07,226 --> 01:05:10,271
Or maybe I just lack courage.

701
01:05:13,483 --> 01:05:15,234
Welcome.

702
01:05:34,962 --> 01:05:36,714
How much?

703
01:05:38,674 --> 01:05:42,887
I'll get rid of it. That thing attached to her.

704
01:05:42,887 --> 01:05:44,555
What?

705
01:05:46,641 --> 01:05:51,521
Been there longer than I thought.
She doesn't know, does she?

706
01:05:52,313 --> 01:05:54,982
That thing possessing her.

707
01:05:55,900 --> 01:06:00,947
I poked at it a bit and it reacted right away.

708
01:06:08,287 --> 01:06:11,624
I saw her at a cafe
and followed her for a few days.

709
01:06:11,624 --> 01:06:14,710
I just couldn't ignore it.

710
01:06:15,419 --> 01:06:20,091
Don't worry. I'll get rid of it for sure.

711
01:06:21,926 --> 01:06:26,180
Consider yourself lucky I spotted it.

712
01:06:26,180 --> 01:06:30,977
I'll get on it as quickly as possible.

713
01:06:33,563 --> 01:06:36,607
There's a misunderstanding.

714
01:06:38,651 --> 01:06:40,820
You're bad at lying, huh?

715
01:06:40,820 --> 01:06:42,488
Excuse me?

716
01:06:43,239 --> 01:06:45,950
He said he'd get rid of me, right?

717
01:06:46,951 --> 01:06:49,453
How did you know that?

718
01:06:50,621 --> 01:06:54,584
How many do you think
have tried to exorcise me?

719
01:06:55,918 --> 01:07:00,464
If you trust him and try something stupid,

720
01:07:00,464 --> 01:07:05,261
I'll devour her.

721
01:07:08,014 --> 01:07:10,808
Gil Gu, I'm heading to class.

722
01:07:10,808 --> 01:07:13,019
Okay.

723
01:07:13,019 --> 01:07:15,313
Hey, Seon Ji.

724
01:07:15,313 --> 01:07:17,481
Yeah?

725
01:07:17,481 --> 01:07:19,650
Call me on your way back.

726
01:07:20,902 --> 01:07:26,407
The world's scary these days.
I'll wait at the bus stop.

727
01:07:28,451 --> 01:07:31,120
Okay, I'll call you.

728
01:07:32,830 --> 01:07:35,958
Take care.

729
01:07:44,383 --> 01:07:50,014
I told you, we've tried everything.

730
01:07:50,014 --> 01:07:53,851
But they're all scammers. Just took my money.

731
01:07:53,851 --> 01:07:56,145
That guy's probably one, too.

732
01:07:56,145 --> 01:08:01,108
We don't want to upset it,
let it lash out again.

733
01:08:01,108 --> 01:08:06,030
It's best to slowly cut back its time
while keeping it in check.

734
01:08:14,705 --> 01:08:16,999
Excuse me.

735
01:08:16,999 --> 01:08:23,839
I hurt my arm. Can you help me tie my shoes?

736
01:08:23,839 --> 01:08:25,925
Sure. Just a moment.

737
01:08:33,015 --> 01:08:34,475
Thank you.

738
01:08:34,475 --> 01:08:39,689
This is my favorite candy.
I want to say thank you.

739
01:08:39,689 --> 01:08:42,275
It's really good. You should try it.

740
01:08:43,025 --> 01:08:47,613
Thanks. I'll enjoy it.

741
01:08:51,784 --> 01:08:53,661
It's cold.

742
01:09:28,571 --> 01:09:34,535
Son, I've been meaning to tell you.

743
01:09:34,535 --> 01:09:39,874
You've worked so hard.
I'm ever so grateful for you.

744
01:09:39,874 --> 01:09:43,210
I'm okay. It wasn't that hard.

745
01:09:43,210 --> 01:09:44,378
Have a drink.

746
01:09:44,378 --> 01:09:48,132
I have to walk with Seon Ji later.

747
01:09:48,132 --> 01:09:50,426
Right.

748
01:09:52,345 --> 01:09:54,305
But it's okay.

749
01:09:54,305 --> 01:09:58,809
The demon can't walk long
on a night like this. Gets tired.

750
01:10:01,562 --> 01:10:06,442
I really have a good eye for people.

751
01:10:06,442 --> 01:10:11,072
When I met you, my first thought was...

752
01:10:11,781 --> 01:10:15,785
Hey, Gil Gu. What is it?

753
01:10:15,785 --> 01:10:17,661
Gil Gu!

754
01:10:17,661 --> 01:10:19,288
Gil Gu!

755
01:10:20,539 --> 01:10:22,541
He'll move fast.

756
01:10:22,541 --> 01:10:25,836
I'll get on it as quickly as possible.

757
01:10:26,837 --> 01:10:28,923
He'll wait for when I'm weakest.

758
01:10:28,923 --> 01:10:31,675
Nigh Strye!

759
01:10:37,473 --> 01:10:45,272
Wait, I'm feeling weak.
Like I have no strength.

760
01:10:48,150 --> 01:10:50,444
It's not even the new moon.

761
01:10:53,823 --> 01:10:55,825
I'll call you.

762
01:11:01,956 --> 01:11:04,917
Gil Gu, what's going on?

763
01:11:04,917 --> 01:11:07,294
Can you check where Seon Ji is?

764
01:11:07,294 --> 01:11:09,547
- Why?
- She's not answering her phone. Hurry.

765
01:11:09,547 --> 01:11:13,968
What do you mean she's not answering?

766
01:11:13,968 --> 01:11:17,763
What the... Why is she so far away?

767
01:11:17,763 --> 01:11:20,558
I'll bring her back.

768
01:11:20,558 --> 01:11:22,309
Hey, Gil Gu!

769
01:12:11,567 --> 01:12:14,487
Welcome. That candy was good, wasn't it?

770
01:12:14,487 --> 01:12:16,572
Let me go. Untie me now!

771
01:12:16,572 --> 01:12:20,993
Would you let go if you were me?
After all this trouble.

772
01:12:23,829 --> 01:12:28,125
I'll let it slide once, so stop.

773
01:12:28,125 --> 01:12:32,171
You shouldn't have caught my eyes.

774
01:12:32,171 --> 01:12:36,550
Don't be scared. It won't take long.

775
01:12:36,550 --> 01:12:38,969
You bastard, I won't let you get away!

776
01:12:38,969 --> 01:12:41,305
Untie me now!

777
01:12:41,305 --> 01:12:43,182
I said untie me!

778
01:12:51,232 --> 01:12:52,608
You...

779
01:13:20,302 --> 01:13:26,267
I, Young Sik, the 46th descendent,
present you the second trial.

780
01:13:46,453 --> 01:13:49,790
By the power vested
in our noble family by the moon,

781
01:13:49,790 --> 01:13:52,918
I destroy you here.

782
01:14:24,617 --> 01:14:25,951
Seon Ji…

783
01:14:25,951 --> 01:14:27,494
Seon Ji!

784
01:14:32,166 --> 01:14:35,711
You scared me. How did you get here?

785
01:14:48,098 --> 01:14:55,230
Stay still, don't interfere. I'm helping you.

786
01:14:57,316 --> 01:15:02,279
By kidnapping her? Why go this far?

787
01:15:03,113 --> 01:15:05,866
You wouldn't let me otherwise.

788
01:15:05,866 --> 01:15:10,371
I need a lot of practice to get stronger.

789
01:15:10,371 --> 01:15:15,334
But you're fully taken by this stray spirit.

790
01:15:17,795 --> 01:15:22,049
I'm a demon. A high-ranking one.

791
01:15:26,470 --> 01:15:30,641
You've been lying to him?
Calling yourself a demon?

792
01:15:30,641 --> 01:15:38,482
It's fancier than stray spirit.
You're just a brat pretending.

793
01:15:45,280 --> 01:15:50,744
If I knew you were a fading spirit,
I wouldn't have gone this far.

794
01:15:58,919 --> 01:16:01,547
Ow, my head...

795
01:16:03,006 --> 01:16:06,760
I'm helping you. Why don't you get it?

796
01:16:13,559 --> 01:16:15,352
Come at me.

797
01:16:15,352 --> 01:16:17,354
Come at me, damn it.

798
01:16:19,440 --> 01:16:20,691
Head.

799
01:16:20,691 --> 01:16:23,026
- Head?
- Head!

800
01:16:25,571 --> 01:16:27,072
Head!

801
01:16:29,575 --> 01:16:30,701
You coward...

802
01:16:30,701 --> 01:16:34,288
Stop faking the rant. Fight like a man.

803
01:16:34,955 --> 01:16:37,207
Come at me.

804
01:16:37,207 --> 01:16:40,711
Head! Head! Head! Head!

805
01:16:40,711 --> 01:16:45,132
Stop! Stop! Stop!

806
01:16:45,132 --> 01:16:47,259
Stop!

807
01:16:51,764 --> 01:16:53,098
Head! Head!

808
01:16:53,098 --> 01:16:54,183
Head! Head!

809
01:16:54,183 --> 01:16:56,477
Head! Head!

810
01:17:00,647 --> 01:17:02,274
Head!

811
01:17:09,198 --> 01:17:10,741
Head!

812
01:17:14,453 --> 01:17:16,163
Seon Ji...

813
01:17:38,018 --> 01:17:42,314
It's okay now. You'll never see him again.

814
01:17:55,160 --> 01:17:58,872
If you want to talk, I'm here.

815
01:17:59,498 --> 01:18:02,042
I'm really good at listening.

816
01:18:14,805 --> 01:18:19,977
It was a time when being alive was pain.

817
01:18:21,019 --> 01:18:26,859
With constant droughts and plagues,
no house was without wailing.

818
01:18:28,485 --> 01:18:33,991
I lost my father and sister and was left alone.

819
01:18:37,911 --> 01:18:42,749
One day, a famous shaman came to the village.

820
01:18:43,959 --> 01:18:45,586
Offer life, or all will perish!

821
01:18:45,586 --> 01:18:50,591
She said we'd all die
if we didn't offer a sacrifice.

822
01:18:51,842 --> 01:18:58,724
But there was nothing in the village to offer.

823
01:19:01,977 --> 01:19:05,772
I can't forget the look in their eyes.

824
01:19:08,358 --> 01:19:13,906
That was how I died. I had just turned twenty.

825
01:19:16,033 --> 01:19:23,165
A kind family pitied me
and buried my ashes in a jar.

826
01:19:24,833 --> 01:19:32,007
Inside that jar,
the pain and sorrow slowly faded.

827
01:19:33,175 --> 01:19:38,513
I learned that after 100 years,
I could forget all and be at peace.

828
01:19:39,765 --> 01:19:46,063
But 50 years later,
Seon Ji's great-grandma found me.

829
01:19:46,980 --> 01:19:52,527
Time stopped for me.
If only I waited 50 more years…

830
01:19:54,112 --> 01:19:57,032
Without the jar, I had nowhere to go.

831
01:19:57,032 --> 01:20:00,410
So, I entered the first person I saw.

832
01:20:00,410 --> 01:20:03,246
It was my first time, but it wasn't hard.

833
01:20:05,290 --> 01:20:09,086
I was full of rage
and had nothing to hold me back.

834
01:20:19,137 --> 01:20:25,310
Even before I entered her body,
a life was already growing inside her.

835
01:20:26,144 --> 01:20:30,440
Somehow, I entered that tiny body.

836
01:20:30,440 --> 01:20:35,195
I met Seon Ji's grandma Eun Hye,

837
01:20:37,197 --> 01:20:39,866
her mother Hyun Hwa,

838
01:20:39,866 --> 01:20:44,246
and finally, Seon Ji.

839
01:20:49,084 --> 01:20:57,092
There have been people who noticed
and approached me.

840
01:21:00,095 --> 01:21:02,764
So, I convinced Jang Su to move around often.

841
01:21:02,764 --> 01:21:04,725
This area's value will soon...

842
01:21:04,725 --> 01:21:11,148
Soon what? Rise? You always say that.

843
01:21:11,148 --> 01:21:13,066
I'm sorry.

844
01:21:13,066 --> 01:21:16,820
I was afraid I'd get found out
if we stayed in one place for long.

845
01:21:18,697 --> 01:21:22,492
I was afraid what they'd do.

846
01:21:25,037 --> 01:21:30,417
So, I acted wicked, like a real demon.

847
01:21:31,168 --> 01:21:33,837
So, no one would harm me.

848
01:21:33,837 --> 01:21:36,256
All right, I believe you!

849
01:21:37,049 --> 01:21:44,514
Even at that cost,
I just wanted to be with this family.

850
01:21:48,518 --> 01:21:53,148
It was a joyful, happy time.

851
01:21:55,901 --> 01:21:59,738
But good things don't last.

852
01:22:00,363 --> 01:22:03,950
Please.

853
01:22:03,950 --> 01:22:11,083
Don't stay with Seon Ji. Come with me instead.

854
01:22:15,212 --> 01:22:18,006
I wanted to go with her.

855
01:22:22,094 --> 01:22:24,888
But it wasn't an option for me.

856
01:22:24,888 --> 01:22:29,059
I still had unfulfilled time.

857
01:22:29,059 --> 01:22:31,478
What did that guy mean earlier?

858
01:22:31,478 --> 01:22:37,567
That you'll disappear anyway.
What does that mean?

859
01:22:39,111 --> 01:22:42,155
Vanishing from the world,

860
01:22:42,155 --> 01:22:47,786
to wander in eternal darkness
with painful memories.

861
01:22:52,082 --> 01:22:56,670
On my 1,000th full moon outside the jar,

862
01:22:56,670 --> 01:22:59,005
I will vanish.

863
01:22:59,840 --> 01:23:03,802
On the night the moon becomes full.

864
01:23:06,263 --> 01:23:09,891
Isn't there another way?

865
01:23:10,600 --> 01:23:15,689
Like going to a better place or finding peace?

866
01:23:17,691 --> 01:23:23,572
Only if I can be sealed in that jar again
with true compassion

867
01:23:23,572 --> 01:23:26,616
and spend the remaining 50 years.

868
01:23:27,492 --> 01:23:29,786
But it's useless.

869
01:23:30,495 --> 01:23:38,044
The jar is gone.
No true kindness is left for me in this world.

870
01:23:38,044 --> 01:23:44,676
I said make me happy sincerely,
not sincerely try to get rid of me.

871
01:23:46,136 --> 01:23:49,639
Once I'm gone, everything will be fine.

872
01:23:50,932 --> 01:23:53,393
Like nothing ever happened.

873
01:25:00,669 --> 01:25:04,881
She hasn't gone out in days. Mouth shut tight.

874
01:25:06,216 --> 01:25:09,135
What happened?

875
01:25:09,135 --> 01:25:11,388
What did that scammer do to her?

876
01:25:11,388 --> 01:25:18,144
I'll just quietly disappear in time.
Please don't tell the family.

877
01:25:18,144 --> 01:25:20,855
I don't want to bother them anymore.

878
01:25:23,066 --> 01:25:25,151
Please.

879
01:25:25,777 --> 01:25:32,909
What I said was everything.
Don't worry, it won't happen again.

880
01:25:32,909 --> 01:25:36,204
If you say so...

881
01:25:37,789 --> 01:25:44,045
Even if I hated the demon,
it feels like Seon Ji's suffering.

882
01:25:45,338 --> 01:25:51,136
What did our ancestors do
to make her go through this?

883
01:25:51,136 --> 01:25:54,139
If only I could take her place...

884
01:25:54,139 --> 01:25:56,141
The light keeps going out.

885
01:25:56,141 --> 01:25:58,476
Mr. Jung.

886
01:25:58,476 --> 01:26:03,982
Is her great-grandmother's house still around?

887
01:26:03,982 --> 01:26:08,862
- Why do you ask?
- Just curious. Does it still exist?

888
01:26:08,862 --> 01:26:11,990
Yeah, it's still there.

889
01:26:12,699 --> 01:26:16,411
Where exactly is it?

890
01:26:35,972 --> 01:26:37,599
Thank you.

891
01:28:02,684 --> 01:28:05,895
Shall I give you a good push
for old times' sake?

892
01:28:05,895 --> 01:28:08,523
That's enough. Let's go home.

893
01:28:08,523 --> 01:28:11,317
Already? We just got out.

894
01:28:11,317 --> 01:28:14,279
How about something else?

895
01:28:37,343 --> 01:28:39,679
[Today's Moon: Full Moon]

01:28:39,679 --> 01:28:41,222
[Battery Low: 0%]

897
01:31:12,915 --> 01:31:15,043
Hello?

898
01:32:12,350 --> 01:32:15,520
Can I take this Fonfon Chiffon?

899
01:32:17,897 --> 01:32:18,898
2,500 won.

900
01:32:18,898 --> 01:32:25,321
Jang Su, I'm tired of this.
Get the green one instead.

901
01:32:34,580 --> 01:32:36,416
Let's go.

902
01:32:43,548 --> 01:32:45,383
Thank you.

903
01:32:46,968 --> 01:32:49,971
Have a good one.

904
01:32:57,562 --> 01:33:04,152
You're eating well. Changed your taste?

905
01:33:05,278 --> 01:33:07,864
I can't get used to this.

906
01:33:09,782 --> 01:33:13,828
But eating this, I have no regrets.

907
01:33:16,831 --> 01:33:23,296
You can talk casually now.
I give you permission.

908
01:33:31,137 --> 01:33:35,475
I can speak casually now?

909
01:33:38,102 --> 01:33:46,652
I never crossed the line,
afraid of what you'd do...

910
01:33:46,652 --> 01:33:49,989
But I guess it's fine now.

911
01:33:49,989 --> 01:33:53,242
How many years has it been?

912
01:33:56,454 --> 01:33:59,081
Oh well...

913
01:34:00,166 --> 01:34:03,377
Time flies.

914
01:34:04,754 --> 01:34:09,050
I used to be young, full of energy.

915
01:34:13,304 --> 01:34:17,141
It's all because of you.

916
01:35:20,329 --> 01:35:22,290
What is it?

917
01:35:25,877 --> 01:35:30,548
Jang Su, you've been good.

918
01:35:33,926 --> 01:35:41,058
This neighborhood will soon...

919
01:35:44,312 --> 01:35:46,564
Just trust me.

920
01:35:47,732 --> 01:35:52,236
You and Ara, too.

921
01:35:55,114 --> 01:35:58,743
[To the moon]

922
01:36:04,624 --> 01:36:08,711
No word from Gil Gu yet?

923
01:36:10,630 --> 01:36:17,511
He hasn't called or answered.

924
01:36:19,680 --> 01:36:22,058
Where'd he go?

925
01:36:22,058 --> 01:36:26,729
He said he's going far away.

926
01:36:26,729 --> 01:36:29,398
Hey, Gil Gu!

927
01:36:29,398 --> 01:36:31,108
You little punk, not even calling.

928
01:36:31,108 --> 01:36:33,027
Sorry.

929
01:36:33,027 --> 01:36:36,197
Thank God. Let's go.

930
01:36:49,001 --> 01:36:51,253
What are you playing at?

931
01:36:52,546 --> 01:36:54,715
You like this place.

932
01:36:55,841 --> 01:36:58,928
I've been busy. Sorry.

933
01:36:59,679 --> 01:37:02,014
You wondered where I was?

934
01:37:02,014 --> 01:37:05,101
Did you go nuts while you went missing?

935
01:37:11,190 --> 01:37:15,194
You just have to enter this jar
and spend 50 years, right?

936
01:37:16,821 --> 01:37:21,033
Tell me I'm right. It was so hard to find this.

937
01:37:21,033 --> 01:37:25,830
It had old kimchi in it. About 100 years old.

938
01:37:26,706 --> 01:37:32,128
I cleaned it as best I could.
It still smells a little...

939
01:37:33,129 --> 01:37:41,846
If you go in, I'll keep it safe
for 50 years, maybe even more.

940
01:37:47,059 --> 01:37:53,065
Why go this far?

941
01:37:53,065 --> 01:37:55,609
Do you pity me that much?

942
01:37:58,404 --> 01:38:00,614
Because I hate it.

943
01:38:03,784 --> 01:38:07,705
I hate you disappearing like this.

944
01:38:09,165 --> 01:38:13,210
I want you to forget everything
and go to a good place.

945
01:38:18,382 --> 01:38:24,555
You turn away to hide your smile,
pretend to sleep when I'm tired,

946
01:38:24,555 --> 01:38:26,640
and water dead flowers...

947
01:38:26,640 --> 01:38:29,643
What kind of demon does that?

948
01:38:31,020 --> 01:38:34,565
If you're gonna act like a demon,
do it properly.

949
01:38:34,565 --> 01:38:39,195
I want you to forget all the pain,
all the suffering

950
01:38:40,738 --> 01:38:43,866
and finally be at peace.

951
01:38:48,746 --> 01:38:54,585
You were lonely and hurt, weren't you?

952
01:38:57,421 --> 01:39:00,466
You've been through so much.

953
01:39:28,494 --> 01:39:33,374
It'll all be okay now. Don't cry.

954
01:39:36,919 --> 01:39:41,048
Now, tell me your name.

955
01:39:41,048 --> 01:39:44,593
Tell me your real name.

956
01:39:49,849 --> 01:39:52,393
I am…

957
01:39:54,812 --> 01:39:57,398
My name is...

958
01:40:00,192 --> 01:40:02,319
Moon Yang.

959
01:40:02,319 --> 01:40:04,155
Moon Yang.

960
01:40:06,699 --> 01:40:12,955
Moon Yang.

961
01:40:15,291 --> 01:40:17,835
That's a pretty name.

962
01:40:21,589 --> 01:40:26,594
Moon Yang, are you ready?

963
01:40:57,875 --> 01:41:01,212
I command you, Moon Yang.

964
01:41:02,254 --> 01:41:07,676
Leave that body and enter this jar.

965
01:41:10,971 --> 01:41:14,516
I command you, Moon Yang.

966
01:41:14,516 --> 01:41:19,730
Leave that body and enter this jar.

967
01:41:38,332 --> 01:41:40,668
Give me a smile.

968
01:41:51,136 --> 01:41:53,806
I command you, Moon Yang.

969
01:41:57,559 --> 01:42:00,104
Leave that body now!

970
01:42:33,679 --> 01:42:35,514
Thank you.

971
01:42:35,514 --> 01:42:38,058
Thank you so much.

972
01:42:51,322 --> 01:42:55,242
I command you, Moon Yang.

973
01:42:55,242 --> 01:43:00,581
Leave that body and enter this jar.

974
01:43:14,261 --> 01:43:16,472
Goodbye.

975
01:43:18,557 --> 01:43:21,101
Goodbye, Moon Yang.

976
01:43:51,799 --> 01:43:53,801
Why isn't she waking up?

977
01:43:55,636 --> 01:43:57,346
- You did so well.
- Good job.

978
01:43:57,346 --> 01:43:58,806
Well done, Gil Gu.

979
01:43:58,806 --> 01:44:04,311
After Moon Yang left,
Seon Ji went abroad to study.

980
01:44:04,311 --> 01:44:06,522
Travel safe.

981
01:44:06,522 --> 01:44:08,607
- Go on.
- Take care.

982
01:44:15,072 --> 01:44:18,242
Ara opened her own little shop.

983
01:44:18,242 --> 01:44:21,161
She's doing great on her own.

984
01:44:26,625 --> 01:44:30,838
The boss left
after selling his house and the bakery.

985
01:44:38,554 --> 01:44:44,852
I'm sure it wasn't just because
he made a good profit.

986
01:44:49,857 --> 01:44:51,608
And me...

987
01:44:52,734 --> 01:44:55,154
I started working again.

988
01:44:56,864 --> 01:44:59,283
Doing what I do best.

989
01:45:41,658 --> 01:45:45,537
I'm okay. You think I'm still a child?

990
01:45:46,997 --> 01:45:51,877
Not right away. I gotta make a stop.

991
01:46:19,738 --> 01:46:22,324
That's for customers spending over 10,000 won!

992
01:46:22,324 --> 01:46:24,826
I want to go to the beach, too.

993
01:46:24,826 --> 01:46:29,998
Stay home. You're sick today. Just a little.

994
01:46:32,209 --> 01:46:34,169
I'll take the picture.

995
01:46:37,714 --> 01:46:40,509
One, two, three.

996
01:46:42,553 --> 01:46:44,846
[Gil Gu]

997
01:47:19,673 --> 01:47:21,216
Hello?

998
01:47:21,216 --> 01:47:23,010
Gil Gu.

999
01:47:23,010 --> 01:47:25,178
Seon Ji.

1000
01:47:25,178 --> 01:47:27,264
How have you been?

1001
01:47:28,098 --> 01:47:31,226
Where are you now?
