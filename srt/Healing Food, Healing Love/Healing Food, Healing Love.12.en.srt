00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:37,509
Here.

5
00:01:52,789 --> 00:01:53,340
Excuse me.

6
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:02,670
Do you still want to...

7
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,250
You go first.

8
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:06,650
You first.

9
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:10,990
I mean

10
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:13,800
you didn't eat much.

11
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:18,140
Actually, I've researched this street before.

12
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:19,660
It's so commercialized.

13
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,070
No one runs their individual shops now.

14
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:24,210
In the rat race,

15
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,440
they all strive for low costs and high profits.

16
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:30,500
Few will try to run their own stores.

17
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:36,170
But I think

18
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,720
the ribs we had just now are delicious.

19
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:41,350
But...

20
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:45,090
That owner is quite smart.

21
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:46,780
He used a lot of seasoning

22
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:48,250
to cover up bland ingredients.

23
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:50,350
He added much on purpose,

24
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:51,860
thus, you'll find them very tasty.

25
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,300
Not just me.

26
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:54,540
Everyone thinks it's delicious.

27
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:56,480
But real delicacies

28
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,910
need precise techiques

29
00:02:58,470 --> 00:02:59,790
to reveal their most natural

30
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:01,010
and flavorful taste.

31
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:02,990
Even the best seasoning

32
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:04,350
shouldn't cover their taste.

33
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:06,520
Otherwise, it will make you lose your original thoughts toward food.

34
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:08,660
Don't be blinded by your taste buds.

35
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:11,510
Then, do you have any brilliant insights, Director Zheng?

36
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:13,060
Can you go on tasting?

37
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:14,420
Of course.

38
00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:16,820
Those were far from enough for me.

39
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:17,590
Okay.

40
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:19,450
I'll take you to another place.

41
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:20,700
Let's go.

42
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:24,900
Here you are.

43
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:25,440
Here I am.

44
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:26,100
Have a seat.

45
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:26,340
Okay.

46
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:27,450
Still the same?

47
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:27,960
Yes.

48
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:28,860
Alright.

49
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:31,990
This Zangshu Mutton Soup Store has operated for a long time.

50
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:33,230
It was run by a couple.

51
00:03:33,579 --> 00:03:34,210
But two years ago,

52
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:36,210
her husband died in a car accident

53
00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:37,810
and left two children.

54
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:40,620
Now, she takes care of the shop alone.

55
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:46,300
-Mutton soup is here. -So soon?

56
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:47,190
Be careful.

57
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:48,210
Thank you.

58
00:03:48,850 --> 00:03:49,530
You're welcome.

59
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:50,210
Zheng,

60
00:03:50,210 --> 00:03:51,300
you haven't come here for a long time.

61
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:52,660
Yeah, I've been busy with work lately.

62
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:56,470
Is this pretty girl your girlfriend?

63
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:57,660
No.

64
00:03:57,860 --> 00:03:58,860
She's my colleague.

65
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:00,660
Your colleague?

66
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:01,740
Right.

67
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,010
Ma'am, more soup.

68
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:05,580
Okay, I'll be right there.

69
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:07,990
My workers asked for leave again.

70
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:08,940
Look, I'm as busy as a bee.

71
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:09,900
I'm really sorry.

72
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:10,700
It's okay. Go ahead.

73
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:11,460
I'll do it myself.

74
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:12,860
Sure, come here often.

75
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:14,570
Bring this pretty girl here as well.

76
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:15,520
Sure. You bet.

77
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:15,910
All right.

78
00:04:16,459 --> 00:04:17,190
Enjoy.

79
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:22,210
The owner looks very optimistic.

80
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:24,420
She doesn't look like she has suffered a lot.

81
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:28,750
Let me introduce you to a special seasoning,

82
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:30,850
chili oil she stews with mutton oil.

83
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:33,210
After I first came here and took it,

84
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,460
I was very impressed.

85
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,490
I came here many times to learn from her.

86
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:38,180
But when I made it myself,

87
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,350
I still couldn't get the taste right.

88
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,400
Mutton Fat Chili Oil.

89
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:43,710
Almost done.

90
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:46,980
Be careful. It's hot.

91
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:47,940
Try it.

92
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:52,960
Have some mutton.

93
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:55,030
What an ample quantity.

94
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:55,880
True.

95
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:56,810
A very conscientious owner.

96
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:57,860
Here.

97
00:04:59,659 --> 00:05:00,940
Add less chili oil since you can't eat spicy food?

98
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:01,450
Okay.

99
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:06,040
Thank you.

100
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:09,300
Enjoy it slowly.

101
00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:14,990
Wow, this chili sauce smells so good.

102
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:17,550
With the savory taste of the mutton soup,

103
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:18,940
as well as its mellowness,

104
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:20,860
it can exactly trigger

105
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:22,300
our appetite.

106
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:26,580
Okay. Add some soup.

107
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:27,660
This is so flavorful.

108
00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:31,390
The mutton soup's original muttony taste

109
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:32,659
is not compromised at all.

110
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,510
On the contrary, the bad smell of mutton

111
00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:36,610
is perfectly covered.

112
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:41,540
The last time I tasted this kind of flavor

113
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:43,490
was when I had wonton

114
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,600
at a street stall at my young age.

115
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:47,060
The chili oil of that stall back then

116
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:47,850
extremely added to the good taste as well.

117
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:48,500
Really?

118
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:50,130
You still remember it after such a long time?

119
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:51,860
It's really wonderful.

120
00:05:52,659 --> 00:05:54,460
And the breakfast here is very famous.

121
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:55,760
Especially its Youdunzi

122
00:05:55,850 --> 00:05:56,930
and osmanthus cakes.

123
00:05:57,380 --> 00:05:59,010
You have to wait in long lines every day.

124
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:01,770
And after the shop closes at 10 p.m.,

125
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:02,810
the owner needs to do the night market stall.

126
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:03,950
She is tough for real.

127
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,090
I didn't expect

128
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:08,050
she is such a marvelous woman.

129
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:12,650
As you are so familiar with this shop,

130
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:16,070
did you bring your girlfriend here before?

131
00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:18,190
No.

132
00:06:18,730 --> 00:06:19,730
It's my first time bringing a girl here.

133
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:45,860
Tong.

134
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:47,440
What's wrong, Ying?

135
00:06:47,890 --> 00:06:49,570
Do you think I should take an experience?

136
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:52,100
An experience? Of what?

137
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:54,430
Aren't you writing the Taste and Flavor column?

138
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:57,050
This is the exact reason.

139
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:58,460
I found that I brought back a stack of files

140
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,560
from the field research.

141
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:02,020
But I can only write from the perspective of a customer,

142
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:04,680
instead of that of a food creator.

143
00:07:05,450 --> 00:07:06,300
So I'm thinking

144
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:07,740
if I should experience it

145
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:09,820
and write this article from another perspective?

146
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:10,900
What do you think?

147
00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:13,130
I think it is very interesting.

148
00:07:13,570 --> 00:07:15,650
This way, you can experience it by yourself

149
00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:16,570
from a different angle.

150
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:17,930
Okay.

151
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:19,020
Deal.

152
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,920
I'll go after work.

153
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:21,580
Good.

154
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:29,490
I think it's okay.

155
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:31,140
By the way,

156
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:32,300
is there anyone in the office?

157
00:07:32,570 --> 00:07:33,190
No.

158
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:33,950
They all left.

159
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:35,020
You can go home too.

160
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:35,460
Thank you.

161
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,710
OK. Thank you, Director.

162
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:51,810
Hello, Bai, it's me.

163
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:53,230
What's wrong, Dao?

164
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:55,250
Did you have dinner?

165
00:07:55,450 --> 00:07:56,730
Do you want me to order night snacks for you?

166
00:07:58,460 --> 00:07:59,740
Ying isn't here.

167
00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:01,010
She ordered a takeaway for me.

168
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:01,900
She hasn't gone back?

169
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,240
Do you know where she went?

170
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:04,990
She is gone to learn cooking.

171
00:08:05,730 --> 00:08:06,440
I'll send you the address.

172
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:07,900
My online class starts now.

173
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:08,600
Bye.

174
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:09,330
Fine.

175
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:19,960
[Zangshu Mutton Soup]

176
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:19,310
The mutton soup restaurant.

177
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:24,150
Here. Take your time.

178
00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:25,320
Good boy.

179
00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:26,670
Be careful.

180
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:28,070
Here you are.

181
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:31,110
Boss, get the check.

182
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:31,380
Okay.

183
00:08:32,169 --> 00:08:32,710
The bill, right?

184
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:33,700
Right, how much is it?

185
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:35,220
Alright.

186
00:08:36,169 --> 00:08:38,200
168 yuan in total.

187
00:08:39,570 --> 00:08:40,130
Shen Ying,

188
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:41,620
fetch me a bottle of wine, please.

189
00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:42,330
Okay. Got it.

190
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:43,100
Okay.

191
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:43,900
Let's go. Are you full?

192
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:46,750
Thank you. See you next time.

193
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:52,820
Ying.

194
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:53,530
Table 6, please get the check.

195
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:56,980
Ma'am, I’m leaving now.

196
00:08:57,010 --> 00:08:57,330
OK.

197
00:08:57,550 --> 00:08:58,290
Come again.

198
00:08:58,860 --> 00:08:59,260
Bye.

199
00:08:59,290 --> 00:08:59,820
Okay, bye.

200
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:05,440
You did a great job there.

201
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:07,330
What brings you here?

202
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:08,850
I'm here to take you home.

203
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:11,260
Are you hungry?

204
00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:13,280
I wasn't hungry just now.

205
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:13,940
But I'm hungry now.

206
00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:16,930
Since you're seeing me home,

207
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:19,380
I'll reluctantly treat you to something.

208
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:20,860
Deal. Let's go.

209
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:26,380
Have a try.

210
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:27,160
Okay.

211
00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:29,630
I used to pester my mom every day

212
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:31,040
just for this kind of ice cream.

213
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:32,880
This is my childhood treasure.

214
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:33,900
How is it?

215
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:35,240
Yummy.

216
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:38,540
But this ice cream was bought by me.

217
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:44,330
Please note that the one who pays the money has a say.

218
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:49,910
Let me tell you a story about my childhood.

219
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:53,170
When I was young, my mom wanted me to take piano lessons.

220
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:55,100
But how could I bear to sit still?

221
00:09:55,690 --> 00:09:57,090
The Hong Kong crime and gangster films

222
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,240
were popular back then.

223
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:00,430
So one day, it suddenly struck me

224
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:01,780
that I could imitate a kidnapper

225
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:02,580
and I texted my mom,

226
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,410
saying "I was abducted".

227
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:04,890
My mom was scared to death.

228
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:06,290
So she brought all her colleagues

229
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,060
to search for me.

230
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:08,630
When she found me,

231
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:10,300
she was angry but dared not hit me.

232
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:12,160
Then she kept crying all the way.

233
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:13,020
I was freaked out too.

234
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:14,370
So, I kept crying as well.

235
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:15,820
This is the biggest lie I have ever told

236
00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:16,700
in my life.

237
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:20,890
What about you?

238
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:22,550
Have you lied?

239
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:23,940
Yes.

240
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:26,980
I can't go into the kitchen.

241
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:29,740
Whenever I cook, I will feel dizzy

242
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:30,840
and even faint.

243
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:34,380
Stop lying.

244
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,580
You just don't want to cook.

245
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:38,050
Now that you don't want to cook,

246
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:39,180
you should find

247
00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:41,330
a good wife like me.

248
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:46,660
Shen Ying, actually...

249
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:48,480
I...

250
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:56,290
My stomach suddenly hurts.

251
00:10:57,890 --> 00:10:59,410
Looks like it's due to the ice cream.

252
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:01,250
I think I need to go to the toilet.

253
00:11:02,090 --> 00:11:02,720
Wait for me.

254
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:04,080
Okay.

255
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:05,420
Take your time.

256
00:11:06,690 --> 00:11:08,060
Why would my stomach hurt?

257
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:30,100
Are you done, chef?

258
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,000
This is the last one.

259
00:11:32,810 --> 00:11:33,500
Okay, I got it.

260
00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:54,270
With Director Zheng and Shen Ying joining forces,

261
00:11:54,810 --> 00:11:56,660
the click-through rate of Taste and Flavor column

262
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,040
has increased by an another point.

263
00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:00,400
Bravo!

264
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:02,180
At the same time,

265
00:12:02,290 --> 00:12:02,980
Shen Ying also won

266
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:04,660
Isen's star of the season.

267
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,390
She well deserves it.

268
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:07,980
-Congrats. -Congrats.

269
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:08,440
Shen Ying.

270
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:09,720
Say something.

271
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:10,370
Okay.

272
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:14,500
I can only say that hard work pays off.

273
00:12:15,090 --> 00:12:16,490
But the success of Taste and Flavor column

274
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:18,540
can’t be achieved without everyone’s efforts.

275
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:20,620
Like Fan,

276
00:12:20,890 --> 00:12:23,170
who fought for the selections every day.

277
00:12:23,730 --> 00:12:24,990
And our Zhuang,

278
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:27,210
whose hairline receded every day.

279
00:12:29,690 --> 00:12:30,330
But...

280
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:32,720
the one that I'm most grateful to is Director Zheng.

281
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:34,700
Thank you for giving me

282
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:35,810
a chance to take charge.

283
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,000
In the process,

284
00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:39,430
you also accompanied and encouraged me a lot.

285
00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:42,390
The reason why Taste and Flavor column is a success this time

286
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:44,790
is that Director gave me the biggest support

287
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:45,940
and help.

288
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:46,780
Thank you.

289
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:52,250
Seems like our ShenZhangZhengYi couple

290
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:53,450
has lived up to its reputation.

291
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:56,080
I look forward to your better cooperation in the next issue.

292
00:12:57,370 --> 00:12:57,770
Cheers.

293
00:12:58,020 --> 00:12:58,670
Cheers!

294
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:00,080
Thank you all.

295
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:07,340
Doesn't Yu Sicheng

296
00:13:07,610 --> 00:13:09,240
like to join in such an occasion the most?

297
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:11,220
What's wrong with that bad boy today?

298
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:14,790
Why do you ask me why he doesn't come?

299
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:15,520
How should I know?

300
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:18,660
Is it because he confessed love to you

301
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:19,780
when you shot outside?

302
00:13:20,310 --> 00:13:20,980
No way.

303
00:13:21,490 --> 00:13:22,510
Don't talk nonsense if you don't know.

304
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:23,450
We're in the company now.

305
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:24,260
There are so many people here.

306
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:26,720
If you like him, just tell him.

307
00:13:26,970 --> 00:13:28,230
Don't make us awkward.

308
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:30,450
Stop gossiping.

309
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:31,350
Have fun.

310
00:13:31,370 --> 00:13:33,320
I love you, babies.

311
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:34,420
Congratulations.

312
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:34,930
Congrats.

313
00:13:35,450 --> 00:13:35,980
Director Zheng.

314
00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:48,910
Everyone,

315
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,690
are you ready

316
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:51,740
for Bai's TOEFL tests tomorrow?

317
00:13:52,810 --> 00:13:53,700
This is a test

318
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:55,160
of Bai’s life turning point.

319
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:56,320
I'm long ready for it.

320
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:58,400
I'm in as well.

321
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,440
Get the costumes. And do you remember the slogan?

322
00:14:01,390 --> 00:14:02,710
Recite it three times a day.

323
00:14:03,130 --> 00:14:03,930
No problem.

324
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:05,450
What a pity.

325
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:07,430
I'm going out with my baby tomorrow.

326
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:08,830
Baby?

327
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:10,410
Cheng?

328
00:14:11,710 --> 00:14:12,220
What?

329
00:14:12,530 --> 00:14:13,690
It's my camera.

330
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:17,460
That's right.

331
00:14:18,050 --> 00:14:19,800
Show our momentum.

332
00:14:20,530 --> 00:14:22,320
We shall let Bai feel our warmth.

333
00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:24,560
We can't let grandpa down either.

334
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:36,410
Hello, Zhuang.

335
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:39,010
Should I send a strong man to help you tomorrow?

336
00:14:39,690 --> 00:14:40,700
Your equipment

337
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:41,910
seems like something you may struggle to carry.

338
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:43,890
Who needs a strong man?

339
00:14:44,430 --> 00:14:45,590
I am the strong man.

340
00:14:46,130 --> 00:14:49,390
I'm unlike those youngsters who can't stand working hard.

341
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:56,220
All right.

342
00:14:56,470 --> 00:14:58,240
Good night, baby.

343
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:05,380
[Are you asleep?]

344
00:15:10,210 --> 00:15:16,000
[What are you doing?]

345
00:15:21,850 --> 00:15:22,490
Xinyi,

346
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:23,900
tell me.

347
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:25,580
What should I say

348
00:15:25,810 --> 00:15:27,980
to show my humor and

349
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,410
outstanding wit and wisdom?

350
00:15:37,190 --> 00:15:37,630
Sleep.

351
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:18,980
Zhuang Yan. Zhuang Yan!

352
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:20,680
I like you!

353
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:22,700
Zhuang Yan.

354
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,600
Can you give me a chance?

355
00:16:28,370 --> 00:16:29,440
Why should I text him first?

356
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:47,050
Cheng.

357
00:16:47,370 --> 00:16:49,280
Your Zhuang Yan needs a helper tomorrow.

358
00:16:49,650 --> 00:16:50,600
I'm not exploiting you.

359
00:16:50,890 --> 00:16:51,880
If you don't want to come,

360
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:52,630
you can refuse.

361
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:58,450
Why don't you drink since you've ordered?

362
00:17:08,530 --> 00:17:09,160
My babe.

363
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:10,910
I don't know if you're asleep.

364
00:17:11,710 --> 00:17:13,710
But after I tossed and turned for a long time,

365
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:15,750
I've decided to arrange a worker for you.

366
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:17,619
I've already called him.

367
00:17:17,849 --> 00:17:19,220
It's up to you whether you accept it or not.

368
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:20,300
Good night.

369
00:17:20,930 --> 00:17:21,680
Shen Ying!

370
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:51,660
A big watermelon.

371
00:17:52,550 --> 00:17:54,520
Cut it into two halves.

372
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:56,460
Bai, have some.

373
00:17:57,420 --> 00:17:58,460
I am full.

374
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,430
All right. Just focus on your exam.

375
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:02,100
Turn around.

376
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:03,890
The essence of the sun and the moon...

377
00:18:03,930 --> 00:18:04,790
Zhuang, you're up.

378
00:18:04,910 --> 00:18:05,400
Morning.

379
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:07,760
Today is another energetic day.

380
00:18:07,890 --> 00:18:08,730
Good morning, Yan.

381
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:12,020
What's wrong with Yan?

382
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:13,910
Why do I feel like I owe her two million?

383
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:16,980
She must have been hurt by love recently.

384
00:18:17,290 --> 00:18:19,490
And she was hurt by a younger man.

385
00:18:19,870 --> 00:18:20,490
Bingo.

386
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:21,530
Why are you so dramatic

387
00:18:21,730 --> 00:18:23,800
early in the morning?

388
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:25,970
Ow! That hurts!

389
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:27,910
The adults' world is so complicated.

390
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:33,330
Who is it?

391
00:18:38,690 --> 00:18:39,620
Speak of the devil.

392
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:42,230
Hi, Jian.

393
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:44,640
-Hey, Bai. -Morning.

394
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:45,340
Good luck in the exam.

395
00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:46,040
Thank you.

396
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:50,920
What are you looking for?

397
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:54,820
Zhuang.

398
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:55,980
We have a guest.

399
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:57,220
Come out and welcome him.

400
00:18:57,220 --> 00:18:59,020
We're going to send Bai for the exam.

401
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:00,680
I am leaving in case the scene is unsuitable for a child like me.

402
00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:01,190
Let's go.

403
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:01,600
Go. Go.

404
00:19:01,630 --> 00:19:02,560
Who's it?

405
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:02,910
Hurry.

406
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:08,770
Who's here?

407
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:13,420
Good morning, Mentor.

408
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:15,500
I want to take you somewhere.

409
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:27,170
Yu Sicheng.

410
00:19:29,810 --> 00:19:30,870
What's wrong with you recently?

411
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:34,420
You've been working passively lately

412
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:35,660
and even don't come to work.

413
00:19:36,310 --> 00:19:37,260
Do you want to quit

414
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:39,060
or do you simply disrespect me?

415
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:43,180
Don't you always want to kick me out?

416
00:19:45,290 --> 00:19:46,500
You're not responsible for me anyway.

417
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:50,500
I'm not responsible for you?

418
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:52,020
I've been watching you

419
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:52,740
and instructing you every day.

420
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:53,980
Why am I not responsible for you?

421
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:54,920
That's not what I meant.

422
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:56,150
Then what did you refer to?

423
00:19:56,170 --> 00:19:56,930
Make it clear.

424
00:19:56,950 --> 00:19:57,640
I mean...

425
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:04,860
I mean that day

426
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:06,240
after I declared my love for you,

427
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:07,400
you left without saying anything.

428
00:20:07,550 --> 00:20:09,070
You just pretended nothing happened the next day.

429
00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:10,710
Isn't that being irresponsible for me?

430
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:20,900
From now on,

431
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:22,120
you are my man.

432
00:20:22,810 --> 00:20:25,100
If you dare to slack off again,

433
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:27,120
I'll teach you a lesson.

434
00:20:33,770 --> 00:20:34,410
You said it.

435
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:35,970
What? Do you regret it?

436
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:37,600
It's not too late to regret it now.

437
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:38,440
No, I don't!

438
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:39,390
No.

439
00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:41,980
You can't regret it either.

440
00:20:43,810 --> 00:20:44,390
Childish.

441
00:20:45,770 --> 00:20:47,750
From now on, I'll work from nine to five every day.

442
00:20:47,790 --> 00:20:48,760
If the moon doesn't sleep, I won't sleep.

443
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:49,810
If Yan doesn't clock off,

444
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:51,080
I won't either.

445
00:20:52,110 --> 00:20:53,170
I didn't say that.

446
00:21:43,490 --> 00:21:44,360
Get up, Zheng Dao!

447
00:21:44,390 --> 00:21:45,020
We're going to be late.

448
00:21:45,490 --> 00:21:46,000
What time is it?

449
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:46,950
It doesn't matter.

450
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:47,420
Get up now.

451
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:50,460
What a morning!

452
00:21:50,490 --> 00:21:50,980
I'll answer the door.

453
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:51,810
Come down now!

454
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:02,460
Shen Ying.

455
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:03,270
Why are you here?

456
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:06,940
Are you looking for Zheng Dao?

457
00:22:07,690 --> 00:22:08,050
Yes.

458
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:14,130
Why are you here?

459
00:22:21,910 --> 00:22:23,320
When Bai was sent to the exam room,

460
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:24,950
the company called and said there was an emergency meeting.

461
00:22:25,290 --> 00:22:26,390
And we couldn't get through to you.

462
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:27,380
So here I am.

463
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:32,430
Is this your cat?

464
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:33,020
Right.

465
00:22:33,330 --> 00:22:34,100
It's Zheng Xinyi,

466
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:35,200
Zheng Dao's daughter.

467
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:37,380
Zheng Xinyi.

468
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:39,250
So it's true that you have a illegitimate daughter

469
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:39,920
according to the rumor circulated in the firm.

470
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:42,300
Xu Duo.

471
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:43,510
Put on your clothes

472
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:44,190
and park the car at the door.

473
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:44,780
Go.

474
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:45,360
Roger.

475
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:47,830
Wait a minute.

476
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:57,350
Zheng Xinyi.

477
00:23:00,110 --> 00:23:01,900
Your company's online delicacy column this year

478
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:03,140
is really admirable.

479
00:23:03,570 --> 00:23:04,900
The click-through rate has multiplied.

480
00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:07,580
It's really rare

481
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:08,330
to learn from you.

482
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:09,830
The sales of your magazines

483
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:10,900
are enviable instead.

484
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:21,390
This is Zheng Dao, Director Zheng.

485
00:23:22,290 --> 00:23:22,700
Hello.

486
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:24,350
-Hello. -Nice to meet you.

487
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:27,400
This is our senior editor, Shen Ying.

488
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:28,610
Hello.

489
00:23:28,930 --> 00:23:29,390
Hello.

490
00:23:29,730 --> 00:23:30,900
This is

491
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:32,900
the chief editor of the renowned UNI magazine,

492
00:23:33,290 --> 00:23:33,730
Lisa.

493
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:35,950
Their company has issued many most-read articles.

494
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:37,100
I believe you all know that.

495
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:37,840
Nice to meet you.

496
00:23:39,330 --> 00:23:40,420
Don't stand there.

497
00:23:40,570 --> 00:23:41,100
Have a seat.

498
00:23:41,550 --> 00:23:42,470
This way, please.

499
00:23:43,870 --> 00:23:44,770
There you go.

500
00:23:44,890 --> 00:23:45,200
Okay.

501
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:52,780
First of all,

502
00:23:53,170 --> 00:23:55,180
welcome to Isen.

503
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:57,730
Let's have a look at today's topic.

504
00:23:58,060 --> 00:23:59,620
How to make top articles on delicacies

505
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:01,070
in the industry?

506
00:24:01,870 --> 00:24:02,650
Actually, in my opinion,

507
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:04,360
there should be rich culture

508
00:24:04,530 --> 00:24:05,920
behind exquisite creative delicacies.

509
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:30,100
Director Zheng did a great job today.

510
00:24:30,650 --> 00:24:31,130
Thank you.

511
00:24:31,830 --> 00:24:33,110
May I add you on WeChat?

512
00:24:33,250 --> 00:24:34,070
Of course.

513
00:24:34,430 --> 00:24:34,870
Let me scan your QR code.

514
00:24:35,090 --> 00:24:35,420
Okay.

515
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:38,070
I heard Lisa

516
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:40,140
is a famous beautiful editor in the industry.

517
00:24:40,790 --> 00:24:43,500
She's got Director Zheng's contact information.

518
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:45,620
Is she into Director Zheng?

519
00:24:46,030 --> 00:24:47,070
It must be it.

520
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:48,990
I happen to have some difficulties on an issue,

521
00:24:49,010 --> 00:24:49,850
so I would like to ask you for some advice.

522
00:24:50,310 --> 00:24:51,190
No problem.

523
00:24:51,310 --> 00:24:52,220
We can make an appointment another day.

524
00:24:52,250 --> 00:24:52,740
Really?

525
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:54,610
Of course. No problem.

526
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:56,800
How long will your team stay in this city?

527
00:24:57,750 --> 00:24:59,180
There are only two or three days left.

528
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:01,050
Then, we need to go somewhere else.

529
00:25:01,290 --> 00:25:01,980
You are quite busy.

530
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:04,100
It's the same for everyone.

531
00:25:04,810 --> 00:25:05,770
What do you want for dinner?

532
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:07,360
What do you usually eat?

533
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:09,950
We usually eat casually.

534
00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:11,580
But since you came, we'd sure take you to taste our specialties.

535
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:12,840
Something's going on.

536
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:14,140
Is it appropriate?

537
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:15,980
You're too kind.

538
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:18,620
Director Zheng,

539
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:21,180
recommend some local specialities nearby.

540
00:25:21,610 --> 00:25:22,050
Sure.

541
00:25:23,690 --> 00:25:25,850
They sure will have a meal together later.

542
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:26,450
Right.

543
00:25:26,590 --> 00:25:28,170
Something might happen.

544
00:25:29,150 --> 00:25:30,060
Of course you need to taste

545
00:25:30,090 --> 00:25:30,460
our local food.

546
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:31,120
Great.

547
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:32,870
The seafood here is not bad.

548
00:25:33,190 --> 00:25:34,030
Do you want to try it?

549
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:35,120
Sure. Great.

550
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:36,880
Actually the seafood here

551
00:25:37,050 --> 00:25:37,960
is quite good.

552
00:25:38,130 --> 00:25:40,290
I'll treat you today.

553
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:44,960
What was the top doing?

554
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:45,820
Where was the jungle?

555
00:25:45,850 --> 00:25:46,900
Why didn't it support me?

556
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:48,770
Sis, I'm the jungle.

557
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:50,430
Why didn't you come to save me?

558
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:51,590
I was just behind you.

559
00:25:51,610 --> 00:25:52,850
I sent you a signal.

560
00:25:53,350 --> 00:25:54,630
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

561
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:56,040
You have no team spirit at all.

562
00:25:57,810 --> 00:25:59,980
I played games because I was upset.

563
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:02,910
But now I find that I was quite happy before.

564
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:05,380
Yan.

565
00:26:07,430 --> 00:26:08,400
Carry me through the games, okay?

566
00:26:08,430 --> 00:26:09,070
One against nine.

567
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:09,620
Count me in.

568
00:26:10,170 --> 00:26:11,280
All you know is playing.

569
00:26:11,310 --> 00:26:11,960
Let's go eat.

570
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:13,280
Zhuang.

571
00:26:13,470 --> 00:26:14,220
Don't you want to play games?

572
00:26:14,730 --> 00:26:16,300
Why do you fool around with him?

573
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:22,100
Only wines can help me drown my sorrows.

574
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:23,440
There are no wines.

575
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:24,430
However,

576
00:26:25,070 --> 00:26:25,940
I've prepared too much lunch.

577
00:26:26,110 --> 00:26:26,770
Do you want to join me?

578
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:30,380
Director, you know

579
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:32,420
it's easy to ask you out for a meeting,

580
00:26:32,850 --> 00:26:35,150
but it's hard to ask me out for a meal.

581
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:38,210
Besides, I'm still busy with the column.

582
00:26:38,370 --> 00:26:38,770
Alright.

583
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:40,110
I'll ask Fan Jian then.

584
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:41,430
Hold on.

585
00:26:42,890 --> 00:26:44,850
There is always a solution, right?

586
00:26:45,090 --> 00:26:46,590
My schedule isn't tight suddenly.

587
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:48,210
Where are we going to eat, Director?

588
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:48,860
It depends on you.

589
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:50,080
What a coincidence.

590
00:26:50,830 --> 00:26:51,440
Let's eat here.

591
00:26:52,350 --> 00:26:52,950
No problem.

592
00:26:54,870 --> 00:26:55,910
Wow.

593
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:58,330
I didn't expect you to cook so well.

594
00:26:58,740 --> 00:26:59,980
I'm just saying.

595
00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:02,770
It's warm to hear your compliment.

596
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:04,560
Come on.

597
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:07,520
Why don't you eat?

598
00:27:08,030 --> 00:27:09,870
I ate alone every time.

599
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:12,140
You make it look like I'm a glutton.

600
00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:15,520
I like the way you eat.

601
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:19,470
I mean

602
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:21,680
I like my cooking is appreciated.

603
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:22,390
I am very satisfied.

604
00:27:23,930 --> 00:27:24,880
I see.

605
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:29,430
-Then I will... -What a coincidence.

606
00:27:29,770 --> 00:27:31,080
Your clothes share the same color.

607
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:32,230
And the color of the lunch boxes are also the same.

608
00:27:32,410 --> 00:27:33,700
Is this what they call "cp"?

609
00:27:34,150 --> 00:27:35,980
You know about that, sir?

610
00:27:36,450 --> 00:27:38,700
Aren't they mentioning "cp" online all day?

611
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:40,100
I can also surf the Internet.

612
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:41,520
What can't I understand?

613
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:45,390
That's right.

614
00:27:45,790 --> 00:27:47,140
We are a couple.

615
00:27:47,530 --> 00:27:50,460
But we're a working couple.

616
00:27:59,890 --> 00:28:00,430
Is it good?

617
00:28:01,070 --> 00:28:01,820
Not bad.

618
00:28:12,230 --> 00:28:12,690
Shen Ying.

619
00:28:21,510 --> 00:28:22,100
What?

620
00:28:24,190 --> 00:28:25,040
Go to the hospital with me, okay?

621
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:25,870
What's wrong with you?

622
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:26,720
Are you not feeling well?

623
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:28,700
Mr. Li is in danger.

624
00:28:30,510 --> 00:28:31,280
Okay, I got it.

625
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:32,860
I'll wait for you over there.

626
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:38,970
Tong.

627
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:40,150
Send it to me after the review.

628
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:40,550
Okay.

629
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,080
Mate, we're here.

630
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:05,120
Mr. Li.

631
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:07,180
We're here to see you.

632
00:29:07,870 --> 00:29:08,760
How do you feel?

633
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:18,220
Mr. Li,

634
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:20,700
do you have something to tell us?

635
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,790
Li Fan, Nian.

636
00:29:26,070 --> 00:29:27,610
Come here.

637
00:29:28,230 --> 00:29:31,420
Li Fan? Nian?

638
00:29:31,850 --> 00:29:32,910
Li Fan and Nian

639
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:35,090
are Li's son and daughter-in-law.

640
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:41,580
Dad.

641
00:29:42,150 --> 00:29:42,710
We're here.

642
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:44,440
We're here to see you.

643
00:29:46,490 --> 00:29:49,760
Nian likes mango the most.

644
00:29:51,410 --> 00:29:54,750
Give the mango to Nian.

645
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:55,690
Okay.

646
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:57,320
Give all the mangoes to Nian.

647
00:29:57,860 --> 00:29:58,420
-Dad. -Dad.

648
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:02,380
Don't worry.

649
00:30:05,370 --> 00:30:06,770
Dad, look.

650
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:08,430
I got the mango.

651
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:09,800
Please rest assured.

652
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:10,870
Don't worry.

653
00:30:13,470 --> 00:30:14,620
From now on,

654
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:20,660
don't quarrel anymore.

655
00:30:20,830 --> 00:30:21,250
Okay.

656
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:23,580
Dad, don't worry.

657
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:25,010
We are good.

658
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:26,130
We won't fight.

659
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:28,010
Dad, look, we are cool.

660
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:30,730
Nian.

661
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:36,300
F-F-Forgive him.

662
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:39,910
Dad.

663
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:41,960
I've forgiven him long ago.

664
00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:43,480
We are very close now.

665
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:44,600
Yeah.

666
00:30:44,950 --> 00:30:45,630
She has forgiven me.

667
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:46,660
Please don't worry.

668
00:30:47,930 --> 00:30:52,610
Kiss him if you've forgiven him.

669
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:03,780
Dad, look.

670
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:05,170
I've forgiven him.

671
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:06,560
Yeah. Right.

672
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:12,630
Good. Great. You've forgiven him.

673
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:17,020
Please slow down. Take it slow.

674
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:20,430
I-Is Bai here?

675
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:23,320
I miss her.

676
00:31:24,610 --> 00:31:25,860
Li. Li.

677
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:28,030
Bai is on the way.

678
00:31:28,370 --> 00:31:29,430
She'll be here soon.

679
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:31,100
Take a rest now.

680
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:33,140
She's on her way.

681
00:31:33,780 --> 00:31:34,300
Grandpa.

682
00:31:35,070 --> 00:31:36,400
Bai knows you miss her.

683
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:39,520
So she will be here soon.

684
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:42,350
Take care of Li for me.

685
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:43,720
I’ll go pick Bai up.

686
00:31:44,730 --> 00:31:45,130
OK.

687
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:07,340
Fang.

688
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:08,880
Get on.

689
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:12,390
I finally had a ball today.

690
00:32:12,490 --> 00:32:13,650
Don't you give me a hug?

691
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:16,360
Get in.

692
00:32:19,390 --> 00:32:19,990
Alright.

693
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:21,340
What a buzzkill.

694
00:32:46,060 --> 00:32:46,500
Grandpa,

695
00:32:46,890 --> 00:32:48,660
I went to learn about the universities at the study abroad agency today.

696
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:50,490
There's a university I really like.

697
00:32:50,850 --> 00:32:51,500
Please wait for me.

698
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:53,300
I'm taking Fang's motorcycle,

699
00:32:53,330 --> 00:32:54,220
rushing to see you.

700
00:32:55,170 --> 00:32:55,850
They'll be here soon.

701
00:32:59,810 --> 00:33:00,250
Almost here.

702
00:33:01,790 --> 00:33:03,320
That university is quite beautiful.

703
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:04,440
The tuition is not expensive.

704
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:06,070
If I study hard,

705
00:33:06,330 --> 00:33:07,670
I'll get all my credits soon.

706
00:33:08,130 --> 00:33:10,440
I might get my master's degree in a year.

707
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:11,900
Grandpa.

708
00:33:12,150 --> 00:33:12,840
Please wait for me.

709
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:13,950
You must wait for me.

710
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:15,470
I'll buy canned peaches for you.

711
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:17,140
Call the doctor.

712
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:18,430
Doctor! Doctor!

713
00:33:18,450 --> 00:33:18,760
Grandpa!

714
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:19,340
Nurse!

715
00:33:19,370 --> 00:33:19,810
Grandpa!

716
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:20,780
Come and have a look.

717
00:33:20,780 --> 00:33:21,110
Grandpa!

718
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:22,660
Please make way.

719
00:33:24,750 --> 00:33:25,510
Come on. Check it.

720
00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:25,890
Okay.

721
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:53,810
Ying. Ying.

722
00:33:56,220 --> 00:33:56,830
Thank you.

723
00:33:57,630 --> 00:33:59,100
Well, I'll get back to work.

724
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:05,070
Director Zheng.

725
00:34:08,620 --> 00:34:10,650
Here, iced Americano.

726
00:34:12,699 --> 00:34:13,170
Thanks.

727
00:34:20,290 --> 00:34:22,540
The article of Taste and Flavor enjoys quite many clicks.

728
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:24,050
We just need to follow up afterward.

729
00:34:25,489 --> 00:34:27,050
I'll ask Gao and Zhang

730
00:34:27,090 --> 00:34:28,880
to write the article for the next week.

731
00:34:29,330 --> 00:34:30,300
You just need to supervise them.

732
00:34:32,909 --> 00:34:33,699
What about the rest?

733
00:34:34,570 --> 00:34:35,630
Take a sip and I'll tell you.

734
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:37,800
Fine.

735
00:34:41,730 --> 00:34:43,130
As for everyone's work plans,

736
00:34:43,150 --> 00:34:45,400
I've made the PowerPoint for presentation and checked them with Miranda.

737
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,199
I asked for leave

738
00:34:47,219 --> 00:34:48,590
for you and me this afternoon.

739
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:50,760
Fang must need help now.

740
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:52,239
Whether it's for the store or Li Bai.

741
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:55,830
I was going to ask Miranda for leave.

742
00:34:56,210 --> 00:34:57,430
And ask for yours by the way.

743
00:34:57,730 --> 00:34:59,520
I didn't expect you already did.

744
00:35:00,130 --> 00:35:00,920
Look at your eyes.

745
00:35:01,570 --> 00:35:02,300
What's wrong with my eyes?

746
00:35:02,740 --> 00:35:04,020
Your eyes are swollen like peaches.

747
00:35:04,570 --> 00:35:06,130
Apply the steam eye mask later.

748
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:08,030
Fine.

749
00:35:13,570 --> 00:35:14,950
Actually, when I was young,

750
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:16,970
I was brought up by my grandpa as well.

751
00:35:19,010 --> 00:35:21,220
But he passed away when I was in the middle school.

752
00:35:24,610 --> 00:35:26,560
So I don’t dare to see Bai now,

753
00:35:28,410 --> 00:35:30,060
because I know how grieved she is at the moment.

754
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:35,670
Therefore,

755
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:37,650
you are the one who understands her the best.

756
00:35:38,860 --> 00:35:41,250
Then you shouldn't cry like this.

757
00:35:42,070 --> 00:35:44,110
You should set an example for her, okay?

758
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:53,560
Hello, Yue.

759
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:55,210
-What a coincidence. -What a coincidence.

760
00:35:55,950 --> 00:35:58,240
Are you going to the restroom?

761
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:01,970
Yes, I'm going.

762
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:03,050
Me too.

763
00:36:08,910 --> 00:36:09,470
Thanks.

764
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:27,440
Dr Xu.

765
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:29,210
Thank you for coming here so late.

766
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:31,620
Save the civilities.

767
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:33,330
How is Li Bai recently?

768
00:36:36,270 --> 00:36:36,930
This is?

769
00:36:37,580 --> 00:36:38,600
Bitter Wine Glutinous Rice Ball with Longan.

770
00:36:39,610 --> 00:36:40,720
Li loved it the most.

771
00:36:41,870 --> 00:36:43,350
Li Bai cooked them for the whole night.

772
00:36:44,260 --> 00:36:45,190
But she didn’t eat them.

773
00:36:45,860 --> 00:36:47,070
She went back to sleep afterwards.

774
00:36:49,870 --> 00:36:52,220
Li Bai is missing her grandpa.

775
00:36:55,310 --> 00:36:57,060
Actually, it’s good

776
00:36:57,060 --> 00:36:58,470
for one to miss someone with delicacies.

777
00:36:59,380 --> 00:37:00,780
But after she has done,

778
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:03,360
she didn't talk or eat.

779
00:37:04,330 --> 00:37:05,240
She just left.

780
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:10,010
Has she been like this lately?

781
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:16,180
Recently she often

782
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:18,880
cries herself to sleep.

783
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:24,000
She must be depressed recently.

784
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:27,160
I think you should take her to the hospital

785
00:37:27,550 --> 00:37:28,830
or go to our studio for a check-up.

786
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:30,310
When necessary,

787
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:31,890
she may need some medication.

788
00:37:32,510 --> 00:37:33,770
She doesn't like to go out recently.

789
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:35,570
I can't really say anything.

790
00:37:38,950 --> 00:37:39,480
How about this?

791
00:37:40,310 --> 00:37:41,200
It's getting late today.

792
00:37:41,870 --> 00:37:43,470
Tell me the detailed conditions

793
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:44,440
about Li Bai first.

794
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:46,620
I will sort out a file

795
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:48,400
and send it to my colleagues in the studio.

796
00:37:49,690 --> 00:37:52,280
When Li Bai is in a good mood,

797
00:37:52,650 --> 00:37:53,210
tell me.

798
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:55,070
I'll talk to her then.

799
00:37:56,620 --> 00:37:56,960
Alright.

800
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:02,770
She's been feeling sleepy lately.

801
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:05,800
Last time she came to me,

802
00:38:07,090 --> 00:38:08,260
I noticed that...

803
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:13,050
Are you feeling better?

804
00:38:13,310 --> 00:38:14,070
I'll take a walk with you.

805
00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:15,720
Great.

806
00:38:16,590 --> 00:38:18,070
It's a nice day anyway.

807
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:47,690
Let's go.
