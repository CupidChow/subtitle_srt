00:01:45,539 --> 00:01:45,920
Let's go.

5
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:02,550
What's wrong with you two?

6
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:04,100
So much dilly-dallying!

7
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:05,820
Will you just hold hands?

8
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:07,700
I've been behind you and not daring

9
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:08,660
to turn on the headlight.

10
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:10,070
For fear of disturbing you.

11
00:02:10,570 --> 00:02:11,740
I've got deliveries to make!

12
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:12,860
Here, let me pass now.

13
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:17,980
Really!

14
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:17,370
Zhuang Yan,

15
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,680
you come out to drink on every date.

16
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:21,470
What do you want?

17
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:29,240
What do I want?

18
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:33,460
What could I want?

19
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:37,850
Every time I ask you out to have a drink,

20
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:40,400
you order loads of bottles.

21
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:43,210
What do you want?

22
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:51,200
I... I want nothing.

23
00:03:55,530 --> 00:03:57,420
So you don't want anything.

24
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:10,730
I do. I do.

25
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:12,350
I do.

26
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:20,390
Zhuang Yan,

27
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:22,310
Li Bai didn't get the chance

28
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:25,270
to cherish the time she could spend with her grandpa

29
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:26,930
before he passed away.

30
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:30,820
So let's not have such regrets, okay?

31
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:33,950
I swear!

32
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,150
I, Yu Sicheng,

33
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:37,740
will always cherish

34
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:40,540
every single second I spend with Zhuang Yan.

35
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:43,370
Even if it's just a second,

36
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:45,470
I will make you feel

37
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:48,409
that you are the happiest woman in the world.

38
00:04:57,070 --> 00:04:59,060
Come on. Let's go home.

39
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:04,470
Y-Y-You're leaving already?

40
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:06,700
I haven't had enough.

41
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:07,220
I'm not leaving.

42
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:08,020
I'm not.

43
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:18,210
I can still...

44
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:25,840
I meant

45
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:29,460
going to your place.

46
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:37,670
What did you say?

47
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:44,130
Didn't you suggest

48
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:46,680
that we cherish

49
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:51,570
every single second of our time together?

50
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:13,650
Let's go!

51
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:15,660
Off we go!

52
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:17,970
A bridal carry!

53

56
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:01,850
I've been busy lately.

57
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:03,650
Piles of work to do.

58
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:06,220
I'll be free soon.

59
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:07,660
Why?

60
00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:08,930
Okay.

61
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:11,520
Let's date

62
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,230
when you're free.

63
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:34,930
Morning, Shen Ying.

64
00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:36,710
Morning.

65
00:07:37,659 --> 00:07:38,700
Did you sleep well last night?

66
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:40,580
Me?

67
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:45,150
I slept... very well last night.

68
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:47,080
Good.

69
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:49,860
For me?

70
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:51,260
Really?

71
00:07:57,860 --> 00:07:58,340
How is it?

72
00:08:00,030 --> 00:08:00,470
Delicious.

73
00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:01,360
Let me try it.

74
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:09,780
Not bad.

75
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,530
A little bit better than last time.

76
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:12,100
It's good.

77
00:08:13,290 --> 00:08:14,820
Is that sandwich good?

78
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:16,450
Why did you get the same one?

79
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:18,140
It's good.

80
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:19,900
From the shop at the corner.

81
00:08:21,170 --> 00:08:21,610
Yes.

82
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:23,900
It doesn't look that good.

83
00:08:28,570 --> 00:08:29,420
I made it myself.

84
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:30,500
How is it not good?

85
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:32,460
That's not true.

86
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,230
It's good.

87
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:36,299
Really?

88
00:08:36,929 --> 00:08:37,720
It's delicious.

89
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:42,409
Take your time.

90
00:08:42,539 --> 00:08:43,289
Have some milk.

91
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:49,990
Hello?

92
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:53,420
Okay.

93
00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:01,480
Miranda.

94
00:09:01,770 --> 00:09:02,890
Wait till I get back.

95
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:08,860
I've never seen Miranda

96
00:09:08,890 --> 00:09:10,190
this flustered before.

97
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:12,830
Something is wrong.

98
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:14,540
Has our "demoness"

99
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:16,130
encountered her own romance?

100
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:18,790
I'm telling her that now.

101
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:20,430
Come back. What are you doing?

102
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:22,530
-Miranda! -Stop it.

103
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:23,200
Mentor.

104
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:30,700
Bring me a cup？

105
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:31,490
No problem.

106
00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:38,490
Here comes another one.

107
00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:40,590
I can't take it.

108
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:41,570
Why is it "another"?

109
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:43,250
You know the answer.

110
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:45,970
You don't know what you're thinking?

111
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:48,210
What do you mean?

112
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:49,660
-I don't understand. -Come here!

113
00:09:53,270 --> 00:09:54,580
You did well this time.

114
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:01,540
Since I did well,

115
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:02,970
I'd like some reward.

116
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:11,100
We're at work.

117
00:10:13,930 --> 00:10:14,850
Are you sure?

118
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:16,740
Because after work,

119
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:18,970
it'll be more than just a kiss.

120
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:19,660
You...

121
00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:23,090
Got it.

122
00:10:29,450 --> 00:10:30,860
Mentor, I'm off now.

123
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:39,140
Mr. Yu,

124
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:41,380
most of our restaurants have stayed

125
00:10:41,410 --> 00:10:42,480
at the top in this quarter.

126
00:10:43,190 --> 00:10:44,940
But a few of the high-end ones are declining.

127
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:47,530
I looked into it.

128
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:50,580
There's a high-end restaurant in Donggang District

129
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:51,360
that is growing rapidly.

130
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:54,010
Its name is Si.

131
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,200
Do we defeat it

132
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:02,990
or take it over?

133
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:05,540
According to the information we've collected,

134
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:06,980
their chef

135
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:08,740
is the new director of Isen's food section,

136
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:09,980
Zheng Dao.

137
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:11,490
I also heard that

138
00:11:12,010 --> 00:11:13,500
he has lost the ability to cook.

139
00:11:17,330 --> 00:11:18,060
I think

140
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:20,660
you can consider coming up with a plan for takeover.

141
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:24,220
But do remember,

142
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:25,880
if you can't reach an agreement,

143
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:29,620
then make it disappear.

144
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:43,250
Mr. Yu!

145
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,480
Welcome, Ms. Lin!

146
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:47,650
Pleasure to have you here.

147
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:49,610
Long time no see.

148
00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:52,040
Please have a seat.

149
00:11:56,650 --> 00:11:57,410
Ms. Lin,

150
00:11:58,100 --> 00:11:59,060
I invited you over today

151
00:11:59,930 --> 00:12:02,340
because I have a small favor to ask.

152
00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:03,830
I'm honored.

153
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:06,340
Although

154
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:09,060
Isen's article on Si

155
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:11,050
was only about one dish,

156
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:12,660
it helped Si

157
00:12:13,130 --> 00:12:14,490
attain greater renown.

158
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:16,780
It did much better

159
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:18,770
than the promotional article on our hotel.

160
00:12:19,810 --> 00:12:20,340
Mr. Yu,

161
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:21,740
please believe me,

162
00:12:22,430 --> 00:12:23,960
we worked just as hard

163
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:25,340
on your promotional article.

164
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:28,850
Restaurant Si is fairly special,

165
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:30,440
plus it's newly opened.

166
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:31,990
People are just being curious.

167
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:34,660
Is it special indeed?

168
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:36,350
Ms. Lin,

169
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:38,890
do you know anything about their chef?

170
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:42,930
From what I can see,

171
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:44,940
Isen's article on Si

172
00:12:46,530 --> 00:12:47,950
is the most in-depth one on the market.

173
00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:52,030
Si's kitchen team is a well-kept secret.

174
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:53,820
We wrote the article,

175
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:55,500
but we didn't find out

176
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:56,580
who their chef is.

177
00:12:57,890 --> 00:12:58,530
But...

178
00:12:58,930 --> 00:13:00,620
we'll continue to try.

179
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:03,210
Mr. Yu, if there's anything

180
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:04,940
Isen can do for you,

181
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:06,340
you can let me know anytime.

182
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:08,780
I'll certainly do my best.

183
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,730
Thank you in advance then, Ms. Lin.

184
00:13:14,850 --> 00:13:15,460
I'll see you off.

185
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:17,650
Please, Ms. Lin.

186
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:18,830
Please don't trouble.

187
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:20,420
Allow me.

188
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:23,820
By the way, Ms. Lin,

189
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:25,980
I wanted to ask you,

190
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:29,330
which editor at Isen

191
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:32,440
wrote the article on Si?

192
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:33,480
It's Shen Ying.

193
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:35,050
That cover story

194
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:37,130
that created a lot of buzz

195
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:37,950
was also her work.

196
00:13:38,570 --> 00:13:39,570
Although she's still young,

197
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:42,020
she's a very creative

198
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:43,120
and experienced editor.

199
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:45,670
If you like,

200
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:47,480
I can ask Shen Ying to take charge of your project.

201
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:50,770
Sure.

202
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:52,540
Your company is full of talents.

203
00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:54,030
I'm looking forward to it.

204
00:13:54,090 --> 00:13:54,810
You're too kind.

205
00:13:55,330 --> 00:13:56,300
I'll get going then.

206
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:56,980
Take care.

207
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:08,570
Mr. Yu,

208
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:11,060
we're sponsoring a show

209
00:14:11,370 --> 00:14:13,320
that the popular idol, Guan Guan, is on.

210
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:21,320
Dr Xu.

211
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:22,250
There you are.

212
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:24,900
Ying, I'm really fine.

213
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:26,290
Just think of it

214
00:14:26,730 --> 00:14:28,910
as a chat that you'd normally have with us.

215
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,650
Be good.

216
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:33,510
Let's have chat. Nothing to worry about.

217
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:35,990
You go ahead.

218
00:14:40,050 --> 00:14:41,530
Sit down. Don't be nervous.

219
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:49,910
Thank you.

220
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:00,550
Ying,

221
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,030
I read your article on Si a few days ago.

222
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:04,740
I really liked it.

223
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:10,650
And you looked after me

224
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:11,400
during the photo shoot.

225
00:15:11,890 --> 00:15:13,290
So I want to treat you to dinner.

226
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:14,500
Let's collaborate again

227
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:15,780
sometime soon.

228
00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:19,920
Do you think I should go or not?

229
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:22,700
Sure.

230
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:24,020
Let's meet at Si.

231
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:40,820
"And you looked after me

232
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:41,600
during the photo shoot.

233
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:43,380
So I want to treat you to dinner."

234
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:46,570
"Do you think I should go or not?"

235
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:00,480
A penny for your thoughts?

236
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:04,390
Shall I take you to the hospital for a check?

237
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:05,970
What are you talking about?

238
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,670
If your mind is too narrow,

239
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:09,620
you can have an operation to expand it.

240
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:14,220
Here.

241
00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:17,780
Don't worry.

242
00:16:17,890 --> 00:16:19,090
Si is Fang's territory.

243
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:20,220
I won't do anything to Guan Guan.

244
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:22,700
I'm off.

245
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:38,390
Dr Xu,

246
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:40,810
what should I do if I feel suffocated?

247
00:16:41,530 --> 00:16:43,200
If it's not pathological, hot water is the cure.

248
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:44,750
Don't bother me when I'm shopping with a beauty.

249
00:16:47,450 --> 00:16:48,130
Hot water?

250
00:16:58,890 --> 00:17:00,020
I'm so silly.

251
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:08,569
This way please.

252
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:15,060
Ying, have a seat.

253
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:16,510
Thank you.

254
00:17:16,690 --> 00:17:17,530
Call me if you need anything.

255
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:27,760
Ying.

256
00:17:28,290 --> 00:17:28,890
Guan Guan.

257
00:17:29,430 --> 00:17:30,750
Why are you dressed up like that?

258
00:17:31,670 --> 00:17:32,200
I have no choice.

259
00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:33,150
I have too many fans.

260
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:36,760
Asparagus with Black Truffle.

261
00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:37,470
Thank you.

262
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:37,930
Thank you.

263
00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:38,550
Enjoy.

264
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:40,440
Try it.

265
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:41,620
Okay.

266
00:17:46,330 --> 00:17:47,090
It's so good.

267
00:17:47,850 --> 00:17:48,360
Right?

268
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:50,900
Sunglasses on even while you eat?

269
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:52,030
I might get recognized otherwise.

270
00:17:55,690 --> 00:17:57,280
But doesn't that make you

271
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,240
even more conspicuous?

272
00:17:59,290 --> 00:17:59,840
Really?

273
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:04,360
I guess so.

274
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:06,060
You're indeed experienced.

275
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:08,940
By the way, Ying,

276
00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:10,600
have you been an idol before?

277
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:12,660
You are so beautiful,

278
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:14,090
talented

279
00:18:14,370 --> 00:18:15,210
and experienced.

280
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:16,020
Tell me,

281
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,480
have you been an idol before?

282
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:19,980
No.

283
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:21,100
Not at all.

284
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,310
Do you have my agent's contact information?

285
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:22,870
Yes.

286
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:24,750
I'll ask her to sign you.

287
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,810
You're so good at giving compliments.

288
00:18:31,930 --> 00:18:32,370
I mean it.

289
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:33,280
With all your qualities,

290
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:34,260
success is a sure thing.

291
00:18:35,650 --> 00:18:37,430
You really have a bright future.

292
00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:41,710
Creamy Shrimp Pasta.

293
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:42,220
Thank you.

294
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:42,730
Enjoy.

295
00:18:43,450 --> 00:18:43,930
Thank you.

296
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:45,310
This is the signature dish here.

297
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:46,060
Have a try.

298
00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:46,890
Really?

299
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:58,230
It's okay. I can do it myself.

300
00:18:59,210 --> 00:18:59,890
It's okay.

301
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:03,140
Take your time, Ying.

302
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:05,260
-Okay. -There's no rush.

303
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,240
Give me the notepad.

304
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:08,100
Okay.

305
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:09,790
Do you want the shrimp?

306
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:10,620
No, no, no.

307
00:19:10,690 --> 00:19:11,210
Keep it.

308
00:19:11,230 --> 00:19:11,840
I come here often.

309
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:19,100
-Lamb Chop with Lobster. -Thank you.

310
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:21,190
Enjoy.

311
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:24,420
This is the most famous dish here.

312
00:19:25,050 --> 00:19:25,690
-Yeah? -Have a try.

313
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:26,620
Okay.

314
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:39,850
How is it?

315
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:41,800
This is delicious too.

316
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:42,540
Right?

317
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:43,940
Let me toast you.

318
00:19:44,010 --> 00:19:44,340
Okay.

319
00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:46,630
Thank you, Guan Guan.

320
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:47,680
You're welcome.

321
00:19:49,430 --> 00:19:50,030
Ying,

322
00:19:50,350 --> 00:19:51,190
I need to use the bathroom.

323
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:51,870
Go ahead.

324
00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:52,790
Make a right there.

325
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:11,300
Alone with a man.

326
00:20:11,650 --> 00:20:12,610
Keep your distance.

327
00:20:13,330 --> 00:20:15,210
Longan and red date tea. On the house.

328
00:20:25,050 --> 00:20:26,530
Why does the handwriting look so similar?

329
00:20:27,510 --> 00:20:28,230
Could it be...

330
00:20:29,210 --> 00:20:30,070
Is that even possible?

331
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:32,460
Can anyone hide so well?

332
00:20:34,810 --> 00:20:36,380
But the handwriting is so similar.

333
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:39,820
Ying?

334
00:20:40,850 --> 00:20:41,490
What's wrong?

335
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:42,340
Nothing.

336
00:20:43,970 --> 00:20:45,090
It's just post-meal fatigue.

337
00:20:46,090 --> 00:20:47,470
It doesn't take away from your beauty.

338
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:51,860
Another toast?

339
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:52,990
Sure.

340
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:54,890
Cheers.

341
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:55,870
Cheers.

342
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:02,970
Oh by the way, Ying,

343
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:05,760
no one seems to know who the mysterious chef is.

344
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:07,070
But you, being so resourceful,

345
00:21:07,530 --> 00:21:08,730
should know who the chef is.

346
00:21:09,610 --> 00:21:11,780
Ying, just tell me.

347
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:14,140
I want to know who exactly it is

348
00:21:14,310 --> 00:21:15,520
that has made something this good.

349
00:21:15,970 --> 00:21:16,870
I don't know either.

350
00:21:17,370 --> 00:21:19,410
This question has been bothering me for months.

351
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:27,920
Let me give you a ride.

352
00:21:28,450 --> 00:21:29,650
It's okay.

353
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:30,540
Come on.

354
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:31,460
We need to go

355
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:32,820
try on the costumes for tomorrow.

356
00:21:33,330 --> 00:21:34,240
I don't think it's a good idea.

357
00:21:34,650 --> 00:21:36,030
Aren't we doing that tomorrow?

358
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:37,380
I'm really fine.

359
00:21:37,410 --> 00:21:38,090
You should go.

360
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:39,690
Won't be nice if the press gets the wrong idea.

361
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:41,730
You're right.

362
00:21:41,730 --> 00:21:42,440
Get in now.

363
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:44,100
I'm off then.

364
00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:44,820
Go ahead.

365
00:21:46,290 --> 00:21:46,670
Bye.

366
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:47,220
Bye.

367
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:54,500
You seriously

368
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:55,760
wanted me to leave without saying goodbye?

369
00:21:56,630 --> 00:21:58,730
You're only asked to finish the task given by the sponsor.

370
00:21:58,760 --> 00:21:59,800
Don't overdo it.

371
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:01,820
But she doesn't know anything.

372
00:22:02,490 --> 00:22:03,690
Then what were all those courtesies for?

373
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:05,710
You're right.

374
00:22:15,490 --> 00:22:17,310
Hello? Are you home yet?

375
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:18,240
Not yet.

376
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:19,990
It takes this long?

377
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:23,030
I was working overtime.

378
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:24,340
On my way home now.

379
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:31,850
Since you know Fang so well,

380
00:22:32,170 --> 00:22:34,010
do you also know the mysterious chef of Si?

381
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:36,570
Yes.

382
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,780
If it's okay,

383
00:22:40,810 --> 00:22:42,620
can you introduce us sometime?

384
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:46,470
I need to ask Fang about this.

385
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:48,980
After all, it's his trade secret.

386
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:52,190
Okay, it's a deal.

387
00:22:53,210 --> 00:22:53,780
Sleep early.

388
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:56,300
See you tomorrow.

389
00:22:56,420 --> 00:22:57,020
See you tomorrow.

390
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:17,450
[Alone with a man. Keep your distance.]

391
00:23:26,810 --> 00:23:27,760
Are you asleep?

392
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:32,470
Not yet.

393
00:23:37,510 --> 00:23:40,890
I want to have Sweet Sago Cream with Coconut Milk and Cubilose.

394
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:42,260
Can you make it for me?

395
00:24:06,770 --> 00:24:08,480
Are you asleep?

396
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:13,250
I fell asleep.

397
00:24:21,170 --> 00:24:24,390
Have a good night.

398
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:29,890
Okay.

399
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:31,100
You too.

400
00:24:41,970 --> 00:24:43,650
Oh my god, it's Guan Guan!

401
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:44,490
What's up with him?

402
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:47,260
According to San Media, Guan Guan's got food poisoning.

403
00:24:48,710 --> 00:24:49,490
Which restaurant?

404
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:50,660
Oh no.

405
00:24:50,710 --> 00:24:51,900
It's going to be overrun by his fans.

406
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:54,400
It's said to be Restaurant Si.

407
00:24:56,210 --> 00:24:57,340
Oh my god.

408
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:00,620
Too bad.

409
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:04,630
Today's headlines.

410
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:18,010
You ate there too?

411
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:19,220
I'm fine.

412
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:20,510
How are you feeling?

413
00:25:20,550 --> 00:25:21,980
Have you felt unwell?

414
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:22,930
Did you have a fever?

415
00:25:22,950 --> 00:25:23,780
Did you have diarrhea?

416
00:25:23,810 --> 00:25:24,780
I'm fine.

417
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:25,250
Let me check.

418
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:25,910
I'm really...

419
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:28,820
I'm really fine.

420
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:30,400
Still protective of her bangs.

421
00:25:30,610 --> 00:25:31,590
I guess she's fine.

422
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:33,590
Your stomach's really something, Shen Ying.

423
00:25:33,930 --> 00:25:34,850
I was right to use you to test for poison

424
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:35,570
when we were little.

425
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:37,260
I wouldn't say that.

426
00:25:37,510 --> 00:25:38,880
Be vigilant for the next few days.

427
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:39,900
Let us know immediately

428
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:40,860
if you feel unwell.

429
00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:41,580
Okay.

430
00:25:42,060 --> 00:25:43,100
Don't worry.

431
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:43,800
Look,

432
00:25:44,450 --> 00:25:46,320
I'm still as strong as an ox.

433
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:49,350
Meh.

434
00:25:51,490 --> 00:25:52,510
Don't worry about her.

435
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:54,090
Don't worry.

436
00:25:54,150 --> 00:25:55,240
Take care.

437
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:16,940
[Restaurant Si]

438
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:15,120
Chef Dong,

439
00:26:16,090 --> 00:26:18,650
did you clean the kitchen that evening?

440
00:26:19,770 --> 00:26:21,030
I did everything I was supposed to do.

441
00:26:21,690 --> 00:26:22,590
There was no problem at all.

442
00:26:24,130 --> 00:26:24,770
Are you sure?

443
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:25,800
Yes.

444
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:26,540
What about the front hall?

445
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:29,030
Jojo and Yoyo cleaned the front hall.

446
00:26:29,070 --> 00:26:29,580
No problem there either.

447
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:31,420
Hey guys.

448
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:32,120

00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:56,980
These are all regular ingredients.

463
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:58,220
Shen Ying,

464
00:26:58,630 --> 00:27:00,160
which dish did Guan Guan have the most?

465
00:27:00,970 --> 00:27:02,620
I was too busy eating that day.

466
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:03,740
I didn't pay any attention.

467
00:27:04,070 --> 00:27:04,800
Let me ask you this way.

468
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:05,680
Shen Ying,

469
00:27:06,010 --> 00:27:08,210
what didn't you eat that day?

470
00:27:09,430 --> 00:27:10,420
She didn't eat the Lamb Chop with Lobster.

471
00:27:12,350 --> 00:27:13,260
-Lamb Chop with Lobster. -Thank you.

472
00:27:14,290 --> 00:27:14,760
What's this?

473
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:15,240
Enjoy.

474
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:18,100
This is the most famous dish here.

Okay.

477
00:27:28,130 --> 00:27:29,320
Why didn't you eat that?

478
00:27:31,490 --> 00:27:33,370
Because everything was so delicious,

479
00:27:33,390 --> 00:27:34,560
and I had been eating nonstop.

480
00:27:34,850 --> 00:27:36,530
I was too full to anything more.

481
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:43,820
I'll go check the kitchen.

482
00:27:44,390 --> 00:27:44,990
Maybe

483
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:46,710
there was something wrong with the ingredients of that dish.

484
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:48,870
Chef Dong,

485
00:27:49,290 --> 00:27:49,850
let's go to the kitchen.

486
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,520
We're from the administration office of the commercial street.

487
00:27:54,770 --> 00:27:55,610
Who is the manager here?

488
00:27:56,180 --> 00:27:56,900
He's not in right now.

489
00:27:56,900 --> 00:27:57,720
Why are you looking for him?

490
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:58,640
We got a complaint

491
00:27:58,660 --> 00:27:59,970
about food poisoning.

492
00:28:00,270 --> 00:28:00,990
Routine inspection.

I'm the manager here.

494
00:28:05,170 --> 00:28:05,610
Hi.

495
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:06,730
Let me know what you need.

496
00:28:07,230 --> 00:28:09,140
We need to inspect your restaurant now.

497
00:28:09,550 --> 00:28:11,550
If there is any food safety issue,

498
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,620
you may have to close to remediate it.

499
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:14,480
No problem.

500
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:15,980
We will do our best to cooperate with the inspection.

take this officer to the kitchen.

503
00:28:21,030 --> 00:28:21,470
Okay.

504
00:28:21,650 --> 00:28:22,650
This way please.

505
00:28:23,750 --> 00:28:24,970
Sir, please have a seat.

506
00:28:25,750 --> 00:28:27,240
Please have a seat.

507
00:28:27,270 --> 00:28:28,470
Looks like I need to talk to Guan Guan.

508
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:35,970
I've finished my inspection.

509
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:37,830
So you are...

510
00:28:37,990 --> 00:28:38,470
Hi.

511
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:39,720
I'm the customer

512
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:41,340
who dined with the complainant that evening.

513
00:28:42,050 --> 00:28:43,280
Did you feel unwell

514
00:28:43,470 --> 00:28:44,880
after the meal?

515
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:46,740
Could it have been too mild a case of food poisoning

516
00:28:46,770 --> 00:28:47,890
for you to feel it?

517
00:28:48,650 --> 00:28:50,680
I didn't feel unwell at all.

518
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:52,890
But there was a dish that I didn't touch,

519
00:28:53,210 --> 00:28:54,380
which was Lamb Chop with Lobster.

520
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:55,580
Who is the chef?

521
00:28:56,470 --> 00:28:56,780
I...

522
00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:57,540
I'm the chef.

523
00:28:58,080 --> 00:28:59,510
I was the one who did the cooking that day.

524
00:28:59,830 --> 00:29:01,920
Are you in charge of the daily cleaning procedures?

525
00:29:02,790 --> 00:29:03,130
Yes.

526
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:04,930
Do you pick and handle

527
00:29:05,060 --> 00:29:06,480
the raw materials?

528
00:29:07,030 --> 00:29:07,620
Yes.

529
00:29:08,130 --> 00:29:09,220
Can you confirm

530
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:10,270
that you'll take the responsibility?

531
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:11,890
-It's actually... -I'm the manager.

532
00:29:12,450 --> 00:29:13,260
I'll take the responsibility.

533
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:19,710
Are you okay?

534
00:29:26,650 --> 00:29:27,360
