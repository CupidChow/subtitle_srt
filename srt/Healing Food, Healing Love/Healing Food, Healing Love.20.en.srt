That's it.

00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:41,370
Hello.

8
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:43,380
May I know how to get to the chief editor's office?

9
00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:44,289
I'm looking for Miranda.

10
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:45,370
Hello, madam.

11
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:45,900
May I know your name?

12
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,280
Do you have an appointment with the chief editor?

13
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:49,120
My name is Han Feizi.

14
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:51,150
I have an appointment at 2 p.m.

15
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:52,560
Yes, Ms. Han.

16
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:53,030
Hold on.

17
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,390
I'll get someone to take you there now.

18
00:01:57,580 --> 00:01:58,100
No need.

19
00:01:58,690 --> 00:01:59,490
Are you looking for Miranda?

20
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:00,240
-I'll take you there. -Yes.

21
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:01,700
Thank you.

22
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:02,240
It's nothing.

23
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:03,290
Thank you, Ying.

24
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:04,010
You're welcome.

25
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:05,180
Let's go.

26
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:09,810
Watch the steps.

27
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:17,690
Are you Shen Ying?

28
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:19,980
You know me?

29
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:22,180
Sort of.

30
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:28,650
What's wrong?

31
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:30,130
Is there something on my face?

32
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:31,060
No.

33
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:33,140
I just think you look familiar.

34
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:34,540
I might have seen you somewhere.

35
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:36,340
Hello, Miss Han.

36
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:37,230
We finally meet.

37
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:38,250
I was about to pick you up.

38
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:38,800
Thank you.

39
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:40,660
This is my superior, Miranda.

40
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:41,450
Hello.

41
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:42,260
Hello.

42
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:43,370
I'm back to work.

43
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:43,680
Go ahead.

44
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:46,579
Thank you.

45
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:47,660
You're welcome.

46
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:48,700
Nice meeting you.

47
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:51,100
Hope we can meet again.

48
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,370
We will meet again.

49
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:55,329
Okay.

50
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:56,579
Bye.

51
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:57,190
I'm leaving.

52
00:02:57,220 --> 00:02:57,579
Go ahead.

53
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:02,540
Miss Han, this way please.

54
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:03,260
Okay.

55
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:14,710
I...

56
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:15,630
Boss.

57
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:16,180
Yoyo.

58
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:18,390
This is not expensive, boss.

59
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:19,180
I...

60
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:21,690
Boss.

61
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:22,750
Fang.

62
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:26,780
You’re finally here.

63
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:28,010
Please talk to Mr. Fang.

64
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:33,780
What are you doing, Fang?

65
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:35,370
There's no need.

66
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:36,940
It's nothing serious.

67
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:38,070
Here.

68
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:46,100
What happened?

69
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:48,400
Nothing.

70
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:49,030
It has nothing to do with you.

71
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:52,020
It has nothing to do with me?

72
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:53,970
Fang,

73
00:03:54,579 --> 00:03:55,820
we've been through thick and thin together.

74
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,410
What can't be solved?

75
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:58,480
Enough.

76
00:03:58,500 --> 00:03:59,340
Yu Sheng

77
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:01,180
wanted to buy Si.

78
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:02,560
Haven't I already refused him that day?

79
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:03,500
He came again today,

80
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:05,530
saying he's going to offer me the same salary and benefits.

81
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:06,260
He put it so nicely.

82
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:07,010
Who does he think he is?

83
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:08,660
What's his condition?

84
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:12,580
They'll have the right to decide the dishes.

85
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:15,980
They are targeting me.

86
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:18,459
What about you?

87
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:21,130
When is the acquisition date?

88
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:22,170
The day after tomorrow.

89
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,210
He want to do this before the Golden Fritillaria Competition.

90
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:27,310
His intention is quite obvious.

91
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:29,100
He doesn't want us to participate in the competition.

92
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:30,490
Then he can buy Si at a low price.

93
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,600
We can’t give him the chance.

94
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:35,320
Mr. Fang,

95
00:04:35,659 --> 00:04:36,340
I don't want to sound dramatic,

96
00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:38,020
but since I joined Si,

97
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:39,670
I've taken everyone as my family.

98
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:41,250
I will never leave Si no matter what.

99
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:43,110
Nor will I.

100
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:47,680
Two points.

101
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:49,700
First,

102
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,110
if you work here,

103
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:54,510
don't be dramatic.

104
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:55,810
Second,

105
00:04:58,420 --> 00:04:58,900
let's fight against him.

106
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:00,670
OK.

107
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:02,380
Fang,

108
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:03,580
don't worry.

109
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:00,150
Let's hurry.

110
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:02,370
You must not want me to be late

111
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:03,310
when I judge a competition for the first time.

112
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:05,960
Of course not.

113
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:06,980
Get in.

114
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:23,240
Everything here is fantastic.

115
00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:26,170
Is it that beautiful?

116
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:29,820
That's because you're by my side.

117
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:31,830
These

118
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:33,010
are not as good as a tenth of you.

119
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:36,700
Are you Zheng Dao?

120
00:06:36,850 --> 00:06:37,240
Yes.

121
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:38,460
It's really you.

122
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:39,220
I've heard so much about you.

123
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:41,540
Hello, and you are?

124
00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:42,070
Hello.

125
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:43,830
I'm Qiang, the chef of Beauty from the North.

126
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:44,230
Hello.

127
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:46,350
Are you here to participate in the competition too?

128
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:47,020
Yes.

129
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:48,170
I represent Restaurant Si this time.

130
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:50,390
I've been a big fan of your blog.

131
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:51,710
I've read every article you wrote,

132
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:53,500
especially the one about French...

133
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:56,159
I'll go ahead.

134
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:56,920
Okay.

135
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:04,040
Shen Ying.

136
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:05,310
Manager.

137
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:05,910
What a coincidence.

138
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:10,740
Long time no see.

139
00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:12,810
Look at that person.

140
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:14,460
Really? It's right ahead.

141
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:15,020
Let's go and have a look.

142
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:16,500
Isn't that the opinion leader in the international gastronomy field,

143
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:17,270
Han Feizi?

144
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:18,870
Yes, that's her.

145
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:20,660
She has a high degree of recognition

146
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:21,700
in this industry.

147
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,010
I admire her very much.

148
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:25,300
No wonder

149
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:27,020
other judges are all kept as a secret.

150
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:27,580
She just came back from abroad.

151
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:28,380
Only she was revealed beforehand.

152
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:28,870
Not for a long time.

153
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:30,610
She has drawn a lot of attention for the organizers,

154
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,360
as she was announced as a judge very early.

155
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:37,400
Excuse me.

156
00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:38,070
Okay.

157
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:38,880
Come on.

158
00:07:45,530 --> 00:07:46,159
We meet again.

159
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:49,190
So you are Han Feizi.

160
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:49,820
Why?

161
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:51,850
Don't I look the same as my pictures on the Internet?

162
00:07:54,010 --> 00:07:54,600
It seems that

163
00:07:54,670 --> 00:07:56,310
I should criticize

164
00:07:56,450 --> 00:07:57,570
those photographers.

165
00:07:57,860 --> 00:07:58,990
No, no, no.

166
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,750
I mean,

167
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:01,830
I just didn't expect

168
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:03,400
the one I met

169
00:08:03,530 --> 00:08:05,010
at the reception that day was you.

170
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:05,730
I told you

171
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:07,370
we would meet again.

172
00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:08,860
Miranda told me

173
00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:10,130
you were judging as an opinion leader

174
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:11,410
in the gastronomy area

175
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:12,430
on behalf of Isen.

176
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:13,310
Yes.

177
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:15,680
But I still feel inadequate.

178
00:08:15,790 --> 00:08:17,840
So I need to learn from you.

179
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:18,660
Okay.

180
00:08:21,290 --> 00:08:22,090
I have something to do.

181
00:08:22,330 --> 00:08:23,180
Shall we talk later?

182
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:24,240
Okay, no problem.

183
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:33,890
She's so charismatic.

184
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,080
Mr. Yu.

185
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:36,200
We meet again.

186
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:36,980
You're still so pretty.

187
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:38,860
She's so pretty in person.

188
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:40,780
She's pretty and famous.

189
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:42,100
Yes.

190
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:43,860
Han Feizi came back from France

191
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:45,400
to participate in this competition, right?

192
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:48,700
I heard she rarely appears on public occasions abroad.

193
00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:50,490
I heard that

194
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:52,020
the scandal

195
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:53,110
related to the chef of Si

196
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:54,880
has something to do with her.

197
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:56,090
Really?

198
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:04,850
Excuse me.

199
00:09:18,410 --> 00:09:18,840
Zheng Dao.

200
00:09:39,050 --> 00:09:39,730
Long time no see.

201
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:41,420
I'm back.

202
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:43,540
Look.

203
00:09:43,810 --> 00:09:45,040
they are still very close.

204
00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:47,580
It's just bickering between a couple.

205
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:48,740
Don't you know a couple never holds grudges

206
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:49,660
for too long?

207
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:51,060
You are right.

208
00:09:51,650 --> 00:09:53,120
Maybe Han Feizi came back this time

209
00:09:53,410 --> 00:09:54,490
to make peace.

210
00:09:54,590 --> 00:09:56,910
That chef will surely win this time.

211
00:09:57,380 --> 00:09:58,420
You can't say that.

212
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:00,650
Ms. Han,

213
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:02,860
I'm a reporter from Southern Cuisine.

214
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:04,190
It's such a great stunt

215
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:05,460
that you come back this time.

216
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:06,890
How do you feel about

217
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:08,080
being a judge this time?

218
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:09,460
First of all,

219
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,150
I must thank

220
00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:11,700
the organizer's approval and invitation,

221
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:13,060
which allow me to have a chance

222
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,410
to meet the masters in China.

223
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:16,250
I can't say I'm a teacher

224
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:17,510
or that I can comment on them.

225
00:10:18,070 --> 00:10:19,270
But I think everyone here

226
00:10:19,490 --> 00:10:21,210
has a passion for gastronomy.

227
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:24,000
I hope we can learn from each other.

228
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:25,180
For example, this chef by my side

229
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:27,380
is a chef that I admire

230
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:29,220
and like very much.

231
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:31,220
Ms. Han, you're too modest.

232
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:32,260
Looks like

233
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:34,020
many stories will happen this time.

234
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,530
So in this competition,

235
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:37,660
is there someone you pay special attention to

236
00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:39,740
or whose performance are you looking forward to?

237
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,090
I just mentioned it.

238
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:44,340
The one next to me is the chef of Si.

239
00:10:46,190 --> 00:10:46,820
It happens that

240
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:48,300
we went to college together.

241
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:50,090
When we studied in France,

242
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,070
we used to exchange views quite often.

243
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:53,950
I learned a lot

244
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:56,170
from him.

245
00:10:58,140 --> 00:10:58,950
You flatter me, Ms. Han.

246
00:10:59,650 --> 00:11:00,460
It was not really an exchange of views.

247
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:03,100
It turns out that you know each other well.

248
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,820
This competition offers such a good opportunity.

249
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:05,720
Will you two consider to cooperate?

250
00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:06,480
Of course.

251
00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:07,900
It would be best

252
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,020
if we can have such a chance.

253
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:10,930
I don't have much time.

254
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:12,720
Thank you for the invitation, Ms. Han.

255
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:14,100
I'll leave you guys to it.

256
00:11:17,290 --> 00:11:19,710
It seems like the schedule of this competition is really tight.

257
00:11:19,950 --> 00:11:21,630
Why didn't he tell me

258
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:23,220
Han Feizi is his ex-girlfriend?

259
00:11:23,970 --> 00:11:24,920
Is he

260
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:28,020
afraid that I'll feel inferior after I find out?

261
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:39,950
Why is she prettier

262
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:42,540
and better than me?

263
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:47,190
What's wrong?

264
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:48,780
A beauty has worries too?

265
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:51,570
Don't pry into a beauty's affairs.

266
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:52,600
Knowing too much

267
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:53,700
is not good for you.

268
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:56,010
Okay, I got it.

269
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:57,820
But

270
00:11:58,050 --> 00:11:59,460
the audition will begin soon.

271
00:11:59,770 --> 00:12:02,240
There's not much time left for a beauty to sigh.

272
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,400
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

273
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:05,890
Let's go.

274
00:12:08,530 --> 00:12:11,370
Food tasting is like selecting good movies.

275
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:13,180
Different personal tastes

276
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:15,230
naturally lead to different reviews.

277
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:18,090
Everyone can give their own reviews

278
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:19,540
based on their personal preference.

279
00:12:20,450 --> 00:12:21,970
We have beef tallow hot pot in Chongqing,

280
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:23,320
various kinds of soup in Guangzhou,

281
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,120
and West Lake Fish in Vinegar Gravy in Hangzhou.

282
00:12:25,650 --> 00:12:27,300
Classic eight major cuisines and

283
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:29,650
countless local specialties

284
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:31,260
constitute the major part of

285
00:12:31,410 --> 00:12:34,210
the profound Chinese food culture.

286
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:36,340
The Sichuan Cuisine alone

287
00:12:36,570 --> 00:12:38,180
contains 24 flavors

288
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:40,560
and hundreds of classic dishes.

289
00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:42,200
Now

290
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:45,660
Golden Fritillaria Competition begins!

291
00:12:46,330 --> 00:12:49,270
Great!

292
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:50,460
Here we go.

293
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:51,800
I'm looking forward to it.

294
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:53,310
Yes.

295
00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:10,470
I’m back.

296
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:14,420
Zhuang. Fan.

297
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:42,670
Even you look down on me.

298
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:05,440
The whole world looks down on me.

299
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:12,380
That restaurant

300
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:13,380
is really interesting, isn't it?

301
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:13,880
Yes.

302
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:14,860
Ying.

303
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:15,340
You're home?

304
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:16,220
Wash your hands and eat.

305
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:17,700
Zhuang Yan, hurry up.

306
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:19,500
Don't be so noisy, okay?

307
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:20,260
Okay.

308
00:14:20,450 --> 00:14:21,780
Slow down.

309
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:23,530
Why didn't you turn on the lights?

310
00:14:23,710 --> 00:14:24,420
It's so dark.

311
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:32,620
I'm starving. Come on.

312
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,500
What's wrong, Ying?

313
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:41,580
What's wrong?

314
00:14:45,370 --> 00:14:46,230
Don't be upset.

315
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,210
There is nothing that can't be solved by a good meal.

316
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:48,690
Right?

317
00:14:58,890 --> 00:14:59,770
There. There.

318
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:01,630
Today,

319
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:04,080
I feel aggrieved.

320
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:05,350
What happened?

321
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:06,540
It's okay.

322
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,070
I can give your head a massage if you can't take it anymore.

323
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:10,050
You're so annoying.

324
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:12,220
Alright, stop crying.

325
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:12,980
Don't cry.

326
00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:16,750
I thought

327
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:20,220
I was pretty,

328
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:22,810
excellent,

329
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:24,460
cute,

330
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:27,300
and adorable.

331
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:30,180
Yes.

332
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:31,550
Everyone thinks so.

333
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:34,410
But I met Han Feizi today.

334
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:36,590
She's probably, possibly, maybe...

335
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:39,670
a little too pretty.

336
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:42,190
That's true.

337
00:15:42,310 --> 00:15:43,460
I also saw her today.

338
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:44,540
She is pretty.

339
00:15:47,430 --> 00:15:48,140
You met her too?

340
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:48,660
Yes.

341
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:50,390
That day she came to find Miranda.

342
00:15:50,810 --> 00:15:52,110
I also saw her that time.

343
00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:53,500
Yu Sicheng was there too.

344
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:54,110
He saw her too.

00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:56,460
Yes, I did.

Well,

00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:01,880
is this Han Feizi

348
00:16:02,530 --> 00:16:03,790
really pretty?

349
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:07,770
Did my eyes deceive me today?

350
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:08,820
No, they didn't.

351
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:10,060
She is pretty.

352
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:12,250
She's elegant, too.

353
00:16:23,570 --> 00:16:23,970
Hello.

354
00:16:24,210 --> 00:16:25,250
Hello, Miss Han.

355
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,390
Shengshi Group called us again.

356
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:29,660
He called my number this time.

357
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:32,460
It seems that he has figured out who are around you.

358
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:35,560
Just ignore them

359
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:36,560
and stay away from them.

360
00:16:36,810 --> 00:16:37,140
Okay.

361
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:42,830
Mr. Yu.

362
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:45,910
Mr. Yu.

363
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:48,590
Han Feizi has something to do with Zheng Dao.

364
00:16:53,290 --> 00:16:54,280
You mean

365
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:56,740
they are old acquaintances?

366
00:16:57,650 --> 00:16:57,970
Yes.

367
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:00,880
When studied in France,

368
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:02,880
they were a couple.

369
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:12,520

does Zheng Dao's plagiarism incident

371
00:17:15,869 --> 00:17:17,930
have something to do with Han Feizi?

372
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:18,829
Yes.

373
00:17:19,650 --> 00:17:20,630
Here are some examples of the domestic news.

374
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,440
It was really a big thing at the time,

375
00:17:24,170 --> 00:17:25,430
so there was a lot of media coverage.

376
00:17:31,410 --> 00:17:33,920
Although we can’t contact Han Feizi,

377
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:36,730
she

378
00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:38,820
is not totally useless after all.

379
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:40,540
Yes.

380
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:43,200
Find a familiar media

don't give yourself away.

This time,

385
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:50,780
I need it to be the No. 1 hot topic on social media within an hour.

386

I'll send you the relevant materials.

Senior food critic Zheng Dao is suspected of having plagiarized

the work of the international food critic Han Feizi.

392

Zheng Dao was expelled from a famous French gastronomy competition.

393
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:35,470
How is it possible for him to plagiarize?

394
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:36,740
There must be some misunderstanding.

395
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:41,520
We are not sure about it.

396
00:18:41,970 --> 00:18:43,010

when there's no final conclusion yet.

398

I hope they come out and clarify it.

I don't need to be prepared for such things.

A rumor like this will soon be drown out.

Aren't you going to refute it?

It's not the first time someone started a rumor about me.

Why bother?

I'm really fine.

This is my first time to win the championship.

432
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:57,090
I've been in this city about two years.

I love this city.

Sorry, sir.

For some reasons,

437
00:21:02,690 --> 00:21:04,180
we'll cancel this championship.

438
00:21:04,410 --> 00:21:04,840
Sorry.

I have nothing to do with Zheng Dao.

442

Although we were together before,

443

but we've already been separated for a long time.

444

I'm sorry.

Zheng Dao and I were college classmates.

452
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:25,300
We were also boyfriend and girlfriend.

453
00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:26,880
When we were in college,

454
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:29,210
we liked to try delicious food

455
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:30,850
and taste each other's cooking.

456
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,250
On my birthday,

457
00:22:33,690 --> 00:22:36,770
Zheng Dao made a dessert named Feizi

458
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:38,770
as my birthday gift.

459
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:40,600
I really liked it.

460
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:42,470
That conniving little...

461
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:44,300
-I'm speechless. -He taught me how to make it.

462
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:46,020
Zheng Dao didn't plagiarize any work.

463
00:22:46,930 --> 00:22:48,730
I chose to betray love

464
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:50,940
when faced by the choice between love and career.

465
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:52,250
You're back.

466

Wow.

468
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:57,300
What is this?

469
00:22:58,740 --> 00:22:59,420
This is

470
00:22:59,910 --> 00:23:01,180
named Feizi.

471
00:23:01,610 --> 00:23:02,760
It's named after you.

472
00:23:03,770 --> 00:23:04,600
I made it specially for you.

473
00:23:05,370 --> 00:23:06,090
I want to make it

474
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:07,260
the last dessert in the competition.

475
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:09,810
Haven't you been busy with the competition lately?

476
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:11,990
How do you have time to make this?

477
00:23:12,130 --> 00:23:13,970
I see you've been too tired from preparing for the competition.

478
00:23:14,030 --> 00:23:15,160
I want you to relax a little.

479
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:16,700
And I want to tell you

480
00:23:16,930 --> 00:23:17,470
there's no need

481
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:19,900
to compete with the determination of winning.

482
00:23:20,490 --> 00:23:21,370
When we go back China,

483
00:23:21,770 --> 00:23:22,510
with my ability,

484
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:24,260
I can surely give you a better life.

485
00:23:24,850 --> 00:23:26,370
We don't have to stay here.

486
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:30,600
I will win.

487
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:32,140
And I will stay.

488
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:35,980
Okay, you will win.

489
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:37,100
Try it.

490
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:45,230
Is it good?

491
00:23:49,530 --> 00:23:50,040
Great.

492
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:51,060
Happy birthday.

493
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:55,300
Zheng Dao didn't plagiarize any work.

494
00:23:56,660 --> 00:23:58,420
I chose to betray love

495
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:00,580
when faced by the choice between love and career.

496
00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:01,900
Lastly,

497
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:04,450
I hope you won't be blinded by the rumors

498
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:06,330
and learn the truth.

499
00:24:07,410 --> 00:24:08,650
Don't hurt innocent people anymore.

500
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:09,940
Thank you.

501
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:17,910
Han Feizi is like a goddess.

502
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:20,180
She's such a perfect match for Director Zheng.

503
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:21,550
I agree.

504
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:22,840
She comes out to clarify it,

505
00:24:23,130 --> 00:24:25,350
which means she still loves Director Zheng.

506
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:30,680
I wonder if Director still loves her.

507
00:24:32,590 --> 00:24:33,750
You scared me.

508
00:24:34,090 --> 00:24:34,540
I think

509
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:36,100
Shen Ying and Director Zheng are the best match.

510
00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:38,460
You guys

511
00:24:38,850 --> 00:24:40,090
are too shallow.

512
00:24:41,930 --> 00:24:42,750

513
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:45,640

514
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:50,530
Ying,

515
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:51,520
don't care about what they say.

516
00:24:51,670 --> 00:24:52,510
Don't take it to heart.

517
00:24:53,130 --> 00:24:54,260
Of course.

518
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,720
We'll always support you.

519
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:57,290
You don't need to be afraid of anything!

520
00:24:57,740 --> 00:24:58,300
That's right.

521
00:24:58,620 --> 00:24:59,250
Ying.

522
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:00,300
Just ignore them.

523
00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:01,310
We all support you.

524
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:02,100
Come on.

525
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:06,890
She came out to clarify it for the sake of Zheng Dao,

526
00:25:07,730 --> 00:25:09,300
regardless of the others' criticism to her.

527
00:25:10,570 --> 00:25:12,060
I can't just stand by and watch.

528
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:15,080
I'm the girlfriend.

529
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:20,210
Ying.

530
00:25:20,530 --> 00:25:21,390
Where are you going?

531
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:24,730
Current girlfriend versus

532
00:25:25,310 --> 00:25:26,250
ex-girlfriend.

533
00:25:27,650 --> 00:25:29,290
Don't talk nonsense.

534
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:30,420
Miss Shen is here.

535
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:31,050
Miss Shen is here.

536
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:32,910
Ms. Shen.

537
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:34,040
What do you think about

538
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:35,010
Zheng Dao's plagiarism?

539
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:35,570
Step aside.

540
00:25:35,590 --> 00:25:36,750
Stay away from Ying.

541
00:25:38,770 --> 00:25:40,370
The truth will come out sooner or later.

542
00:25:40,670 --> 00:25:41,790
Zheng Dao didn't plagiarize.

543
00:25:42,010 --> 00:25:42,960
That's right.

544
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:43,540
Ms. Shen,

545
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:44,740
as Zheng Dao's girlfriend,

546
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:45,550
what do you feel about

547
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:46,660
the fact that his ex uploaded a video

548
00:25:46,690 --> 00:25:47,440
on Weibo?

549
00:25:48,230 --> 00:25:49,530
Are they getting back together?

550
00:25:49,570 --> 00:25:50,860
Han Feizi must still love Zheng Dao.

551
00:25:51,070 --> 00:25:51,780
Otherwise, she wouldn't have stood up to clarify it.

552
00:25:51,810 --> 00:25:52,990
Zheng Dao will surely be very touched.

553
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:54,900
He's handsome and she's beautiful.

554
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:55,920
And they both are outstanding.

555
00:25:56,110 --> 00:25:57,630
I'll definitely ship them.

556
00:25:58,800 --> 00:25:59,500
First of all,

557
00:25:59,730 --> 00:26:01,490
I'm very grateful

558
00:26:01,570 --> 00:26:02,560
that Miss Han could come out and clarify it for Zheng Dao.

559
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:04,140
Secondly,

560
00:26:04,650 --> 00:26:06,310
even if she didn't release this video,

561
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:08,500
I would believe in Director Zheng all the same.

562
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:09,750
Director Zheng

563
00:26:10,030 --> 00:26:12,180
has a unique perspective on food reviewing.

564
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:14,510
His cooking skills are excellent, too.

565
00:26:14,670 --> 00:26:16,270
So there's no need for him to plagiarize.

566
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:17,940
Yes, it's not necessary.

567
00:26:17,990 --> 00:26:18,470
Shen Ying,

568
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:19,870
are you with Zheng Dao

569
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:20,850
because of your career?

570
00:26:20,890 --> 00:26:21,280
Yes.

571
00:26:21,850 --> 00:26:22,900
Zheng Dao is the reason

572
00:26:23,270 --> 00:26:25,050
that my career is complete.

573
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:26,140
Shen Ying,

574
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:27,030
is Han Feizi going to

575
00:26:27,050 --> 00:26:28,530
affect your relationship with Zheng Dao?

576
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:29,790
If Zheng Dao really plagiarized,

577
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:30,780
how would you face him?

578
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:31,990
Sorry, I have something to do.

579
00:26:32,030 --> 00:26:33,190
Wait, one more question.

580
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:33,720
Wait no more!

581
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:34,550
Ying, go!

582
00:26:34,570 --> 00:26:35,320
Excuse me.

583
00:26:35,350 --> 00:26:36,350
Stop chasing.

584
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:36,900
Seriously!

585
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:40,060
I'll leave the rest to you.

586
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,820
Zheng Dao made a dessert named Feizi

587
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,370
as my birthday gift.

588
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:53,850
Zheng Dao didn't plagiarize any work.

589
00:26:55,190 --> 00:26:56,950
I chose to betray love

590
00:26:57,770 --> 00:26:59,080
when faced by the choice between love and career.

591
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:00,630
Lastly,

592
00:27:01,330 --> 00:27:03,280
I hope you won't be blinded by the rumors

593
00:27:03,730 --> 00:27:04,860
and learn the truth.

594
00:27:06,150 --> 00:27:07,470
Don't hurt innocent people anymore.

595
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:17,450
Shen Ying,

596
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:18,800
are you with Zheng Dao

597
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:19,700
because of your career?

598
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:20,690
Zheng Dao is the reason

599
00:27:21,020 --> 00:27:22,780
that my career is complete.

600
00:27:23,450 --> 00:27:24,010
Shen Ying,

601
00:27:24,050 --> 00:27:24,850
is Han Feizi going to

602
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,380
affect your relationship with Zheng Dao?

603
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:27,630
If Zheng Dao really plagiarized,

604
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:28,590
how would you face him?

605
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:29,660
Sorry, I have something to do.

606
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:30,890
Do you also

607
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:33,770
choose to be with me

608
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,300
because you want get something from me?

609
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:38,340
Shen Ying.

610
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:40,380
Tell me

611
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:43,070
what are your real thoughts.

612
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:46,560
Is this video real?

613
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:47,680
Go back and rest early.

614
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:49,460
The competition is tomorrow.

615
00:27:52,030 --> 00:27:52,720
See you.

616
00:27:59,470 --> 00:28:00,120
First of all,

617
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:02,110
I'm very grateful

618
00:28:02,130 --> 00:28:03,210
that Miss Han could come out and clarify it for Zheng Dao.

619
00:28:04,110 --> 00:28:04,700
Secondly,

620
00:28:05,210 --> 00:28:06,840
even if she didn't release this video,

621
00:28:07,450 --> 00:28:09,330
I would believe in Director Zheng all the same.

622
00:28:09,650 --> 00:28:10,250
Director Zheng

623
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:12,840
has a unique perspective on food reviewing.

624
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:14,420
Yes.

625
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:15,860
Zheng Dao is the reason

626
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,070
that my career is complete.
