2
00:01:32,539 --> 00:01:34,440
[Episode 17]

3
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:39,850
As expected from a restaurant that everyone compliments,

4
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:41,720
the ingredients here are really luxurious.

5
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,850
The moral standing of the chef decides the lower limit of a dish.

6
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:54,660
What do you think of this dish then?

7
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:55,710
There is no lower limit.

8
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:59,210
What do you mean by that?

9
00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:01,540
Home-style dishes need homely ingredients.

10
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:02,660
They're mainly about emotions,

11
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:04,050
instead of extravagant ingredients.

12
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:07,570
Why do you talk more and more like me?

13
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:10,979
Home-style dishes have now entered the restaurant.

14
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:13,920
The possibility and feasibility

15
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:17,600
of emotional bond between chefs and customers

16
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:18,490
are very low.

17
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:20,160
So,

18
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:23,980
your so-called emotions are out of the question.

19
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:26,480
That's why moral standing decides the lower limit.

20
00:02:27,329 --> 00:02:29,480
If chefs don't even care about the customers' feelings,

21
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:32,750
how can they make delicious home-style dishes?

22
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,440
Don't you think

23
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:40,840
that is just idealism?

24
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:42,520
Don't you think you're cold-hearted?

25
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,300
Someone talking to their father

26
00:02:45,329 --> 00:02:46,780
in such an attitude

27
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:48,980
is even colder and more ruthless.

28
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:00,320
Guys,

29
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:01,820
why don’t we

30
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,050
return to the dish itself?

31
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,120
-No! -No!

32
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:09,010
How am I supposed to do the interview like this?

33
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:10,650
Forget it then.

34
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:16,250
Please don't mind, sir.

35
00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:18,400
I'm fine.

36
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:22,930
I'm not petty like someone.

37
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,610
Don't slander me like that.

38
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:25,610
Did I?

39
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,200
I'm just telling the truth.

40
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:48,930
Sorry, sir.

41
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:50,410
It's okay.

42
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:51,640
Sit down.

43
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:53,270
Let's continue our interview.

44
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:54,340
Okay.

45
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:55,500
Sir,

46
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:56,990
I think this dish

47
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:58,730
looks very elegant

48
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:00,450
and it tastes delicious.

49
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:02,060
On top of the egg white,

50
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:04,060
shrimp and crab combine just right.

51
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:07,750
Besides, it is studded with the ham dices and its flavor is enhanced by them too.

52
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:09,580
It's really a top-grade dish.

53
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:10,580
It seems

54
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:12,450
you tasted it attentively.

55
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:13,360
Thank you.

56
00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:15,150
Shen,

57
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:18,190
how is Zheng Dao doing recently?

58
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:20,410
You mean...

59
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:21,760
His health.

60
00:04:22,850 --> 00:04:26,260
No, I mean, is he quarrelsome to others

61
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:27,710
just as to me?

62
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:29,950
He is healthy in body

63
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:31,630
and stable in emotions.

64
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:32,909
Except for just now.

65
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:36,140
That's right.

66
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:37,260
Otherwise,

67
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:42,400
I don't think he could find a girlfriend like you.

68
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:44,200
Sir,

69
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:47,100
when did you find out?

70
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:48,480
Last time

71
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:51,320
when you two were doing live streaming together for Si,

72
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:52,510
I saw it.

73
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:54,980
A father knows his son the best.

74
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:56,320
But this kid

75
00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:58,790
indeed had a bad temper before.

76
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:01,950
I really want to know

77
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:04,510
how you fell in love with him.

78
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:06,680
Actually, when I met him,

79
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,320
he did have a bad temper.

80
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:10,130
We quarreled the first time we met.

81
00:05:10,890 --> 00:05:11,320
Besides,

82
00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:13,530
we have different understandings toward food.

83
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:15,860
At that time,

84
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:18,660
I liked to dig up people and stories behind the food.

85
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:20,320
But he

86
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:23,290
thinks professional food reviews

87
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:25,290
must be based on

88
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,150
the criteria built by scientific data.

89
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:31,440
So what he just told me...

90
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:34,930
Connecting with customers...

91
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:37,500
It's just to debate with me, isn't it?

92
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:39,550
This kid!

93
00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:40,720
After all these years,

94
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:42,370
why is he still so bad-tempered?

95
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:43,520
Sir,

96
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:45,220
not exactly.

97
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:48,020
Because later we gradually found that

98
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:49,420
the soft index of emotions

99
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:50,980
which I approve

100
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:53,020
and the hard index that he acknowledges

101
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:54,900
are both indispensable

102
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:55,950
in food review.

103
00:05:56,450 --> 00:05:57,409
So now,

104
00:05:57,790 --> 00:05:59,090
we have influenced each other.

105
00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:00,700
Besides,

106
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:01,800
we are

107
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:03,940
giving full play to our strong point separately.

108
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:05,380
You can really

109
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:08,210
change Zheng Dao's mind.

110
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:09,980
To be honest,

111
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:12,370
I envy you.

112
00:06:13,170 --> 00:06:13,720
Sir,

113
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:15,410
I think you can do it too.

114
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:16,990
You know,

115
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:18,580
Zheng Dao

116
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:20,050
is cold on the outside but warm on the inside.

117
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:23,100
You

118
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:25,190
don't have to comfort me

119
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,910
with the old cliché.

120
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,420
Here, have some water.

121
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:40,630
I always think that

122
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:43,659
no one can truly be changed by anyone.

123
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:45,750
It's all because of love

124
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:48,680
that we're willing to put aside the prejudice

125
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:50,290
and take a look in each other's heart.

126
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:53,790
To be honest,

127
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,390
except for Zheng Dao's mom,

128
00:06:58,420 --> 00:06:59,409
you're the first person

129
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,390
who firmly believes

130
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,430
that Zheng Dao and I can make up.

131
00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:04,900
His mom?

132
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:06,300
Yes.

133
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:11,660
When his mom was dying,

134
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:15,150
her last call was for me.

135
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:20,210
I was so busy with my career at the time.

136
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:24,180
I neglected taking care of my family.

137
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:28,290
Even when his mother

138
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:33,020
was at her last moment,

139
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:36,240
I couldn't make it to her side.

140
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:42,880
So,

141
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,680
after his mother passed away,

142
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:48,060
all these years,

143
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,940
I still can't forgive myself.

144
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:57,430
And I don't know how to face Zheng Dao, either.

145
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:02,760
Sir.

146
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:05,710
Shen.

147
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:10,520
If anything happens between you and Zheng Dao,

148
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,980
you can come to me anytime, okay?

149
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:16,090
Okay.

150
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:19,080
In that case,

151
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:22,110
we are friends from now on?

152
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:42,260
I thought you already left.

153
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:43,990
Even if I had a problem with him,

154
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:45,100
I have to send you home.

155
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:00,960
Actually, your dad still misses you a lot.

156
00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:03,530
He asked me many questions about you.

157
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:08,380
I don't want you to act as a lobbyist.

158
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:09,530
I don't buy that.

159
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:12,220
If he really cares about me, he'd do that long ago.

160
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:14,720
And I don't want you

161
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:16,620
to please that old man

162
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:19,100
just to be a good daughter-in-law.

163
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:22,860
I'm here as his friend,

164
00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:25,510
not a lobbyist.

165
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:28,420
You've become friends so fast?

166
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:30,530
Your dad also said

167
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:32,480
I could ask him for help in the future.

168
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:34,040
So vulgar.

169
00:09:34,930 --> 00:09:35,610
He'll only cause trouble.

170
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:37,500
What are you talking about?

171
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:40,600
He is just being kind, okay?

172
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:42,330
What good intentions can he have?

173
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,250
Mind your own business, okay?

174
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,580
Fine, I will.

175
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:50,720
I won't say anything anymore.

176
00:09:58,860 --> 00:09:59,940
I'm going back to Fan Jian's house today.

177
00:10:04,410 --> 00:10:05,520
Okay, I'll send you there.

178
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:46,660
You're home.

179
00:10:58,190 --> 00:11:00,630
Didn't you say you were going to Zheng Dao's house after your business trip?

180
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:03,680
Who would care to go there?

181
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:08,020
I guess they had a fight.

182
00:11:11,930 --> 00:11:14,090
I had an interview with Zheng Dao's father today.

183
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:15,660
I didn't know at first.

184
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:17,100
But the minute we got there,

185
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:18,140
he had a fight with his dad.

186
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:19,220
He didn't listen to me at all.

187
00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:22,790
It seems his original family is not a happy one.

188
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:25,490
What does it have to do with the original family?

189
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:26,480
What's all that nonsense?

190
00:11:26,570 --> 00:11:26,940
See?

191
00:11:27,450 --> 00:11:29,180
I told you to go for Ye Zhiqiu.

192
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,570
Both his parents are still alive and they are close.

193
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:32,520
Unlike Zheng Dao.

194
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:37,830
What are you doing?

195
00:11:38,570 --> 00:11:40,400
I'm doing this for your good.

196
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:42,510
Only I can talk about my boyfriend.

197
00:11:42,530 --> 00:11:43,640
Why should I change a boyfriend?

198
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,030
Zhuang.

199
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:48,960
Let me hug you too.

200
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:50,380
Go away.

201
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:53,910
What are you waiting for?

202
00:11:54,410 --> 00:11:56,570
Go get some delicious food for us now.

203
00:11:57,310 --> 00:11:57,670
Go.

204
00:11:58,020 --> 00:12:00,480
You ditch your friend the moment you get a boyfriend.

205
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:19,750
Actually, your dad still misses you a lot.

206
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:22,040
He asked me many questions about you.

207
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,970
I don't want you to act as a lobbyist.

208
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:26,890
I don't buy that.

209
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:29,650
If he really cares about me, he'd do that long ago.

210
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:33,230
I'm here as his friend,

211
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:35,740
not a lobbyist.

212
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:37,650
Mind your own business, okay?

213
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:40,400
Fine, I will.

214
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:42,530
I won't say anything anymore.

215
00:12:58,880 --> 00:12:59,780
[Xu Duo]

216
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:06,590
Where are you?

217
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:09,060
I'm dancing in a night club.

218
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:11,870
Forget it. Go ahead.

219
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:17,070
He fails me at the critical moment.

220
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:22,450
[Fang Siwei]

221
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:28,180
Hello, Siwei.

222
00:13:28,650 --> 00:13:30,030
Hey, get to the point quickly.

223
00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:31,590
I have to go climbing the mountains tomorrow morning.

224
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:32,660
Climbing the mountain?

225
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:35,000
Yes, we're going to collect Chinese Toon buds.

226
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:36,890
Well,

227
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:39,390
I have a favor to ask.

228
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:43,220
I want to apologize to Shen Ying.

229
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:44,890
I want you to tell her for me.

230
00:13:45,830 --> 00:13:47,220
You had a fight with Shen Ying?

231
00:13:47,710 --> 00:13:48,220
What happened?

232
00:13:48,990 --> 00:13:51,940
I shouldn't blame her for being nosy

233
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:53,890
because I was annoyed by Zheng Youwei.

234
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:55,420
I see.

235
00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:56,260
Okay.

236
00:13:57,170 --> 00:13:58,050
Go apologize yourself.

237
00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:00,410
I'm begging you.

238
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:01,020
Really.

239
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:01,640
Do me a favor.

240
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:04,620
You're a man. Why are you so reluctant to apologize?

241
00:14:04,650 --> 00:14:05,530
What's with all that?

242
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:06,760
Listen.

243
00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:08,730
It's like you have to fart with your pants off.

244
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:09,590
It's totally unnecessary.

245
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:10,330
Got it?

246
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:13,500
Pants off...

247
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,160
Hanging up.

248
00:14:35,570 --> 00:14:36,790
I have something to tell you tomorrow.

249
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:51,790
Some of the new restaurants are pretty good.

250
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:52,470
Let's go check them after work.

251
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:57,140
What a coincidence.

252
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,800
Zhuang, you take this elevator too?

253
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:00,860
Who doesn't take the elevator to go to work?

254
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:02,380
You're right.

255
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:05,100
Thank you. See you tomorrow.

256
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:05,900
Mentor.

257
00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:07,760
This is the lunch box I made myself.

258
00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:09,280
It's the first time I cooked.

259
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:10,050
It must be delicious.

260
00:15:10,070 --> 00:15:10,640
Have some.

261
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:11,910
No, thanks.

262
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:15,260
I'll do a trivial thing like operating the elevator for you.

263
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:15,610
Hello.

264
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,210
It's my job to operate the elevator.

265
00:15:17,430 --> 00:15:17,950
Which floor?

266
00:15:21,090 --> 00:15:22,000
-Room 407. -Room 407.

267
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:24,260
I learned a new massage technique.

268
00:15:24,370 --> 00:15:25,250
It's really comfortable.

269
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:25,920
Would you like to try it out?

270
00:15:32,090 --> 00:15:32,620
Yu Sicheng,

271
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:33,590
go to the rooftop with me.

272
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:34,920
Okay.

273
00:15:35,850 --> 00:15:36,260
Okay.

274
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:38,760
Take it.

275
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:40,580
-Take it for me, please. -Okay.

276
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:43,760
Zhuang Yan.

277
00:15:49,090 --> 00:15:49,690
Yu Sicheng,

278
00:15:50,030 --> 00:15:51,070
what's wrong with you today?

279
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:53,580
Nothing.

280
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:57,330
I'm trying to please my future girlfriend.

281
00:15:58,180 --> 00:15:59,810
Who's your girlfriend?

282
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:03,330
Even if you're not now,

283
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:05,740
in the future you will definitely be.

284
00:16:07,430 --> 00:16:08,970
Have you listened to me or not?

285
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:10,640
I've already told you

286
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:11,880
we are not from the same world.

287
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:14,840
Our relationship is over.

288
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:16,300
Zhuang Yan.

289
00:16:17,970 --> 00:16:19,040
It was indeed my fault.

290
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:20,760
I shouldn't have kept it from you.

291
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:22,770
But can you give me another chance?

292
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:24,230
OK?

293
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:26,210
I don't want to.

294
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:28,860
I know

295
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:31,490
I was wrong.

296
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:33,210
It's just right that you're angry.

297
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:34,670
But from now on,

298
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:35,980
can we start over?

299
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:39,780
I've made up my mind.

300
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:40,750
No matter what you think,

301
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,840
I will win your heart back again.

302
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:45,260
I've thought it through.

303
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:46,460
At worst,

304
00:16:47,170 --> 00:16:48,570
I'll cut ties with that old man.

305
00:16:50,590 --> 00:16:51,010
So,

306
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:53,630
can you give me another chance?

307
00:16:55,330 --> 00:16:55,840
OK?

308
00:16:58,310 --> 00:16:59,790
Listen to yourself.

309
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,770
You're still a kid, Yu Sicheng.

310
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:04,020
Do you think it's only a matter

311
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:05,319
between the two of us?

312
00:17:07,770 --> 00:17:08,280
Zhuang Yan.

313
00:17:09,099 --> 00:17:10,230
I will prove

314
00:17:10,270 --> 00:17:10,940
my ability to you.

315
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:11,790
Trust me.

316
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:15,690
Whatever.

317
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:26,910
You're here.

318
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,079
I'm here to tell you

319
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,030
not to try to learn about me through others.

320
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:31,910
You've been neglecting me for 20 years.

321
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,140
Why are you pretending to care now?

322
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:37,950
Dao.

323
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:41,650
It's been so many years.

324
00:17:43,290 --> 00:17:46,070
Whether I was negligent

325
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:47,840
or irresponsible,

326
00:17:48,390 --> 00:17:49,000
I sincerely and

327
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:52,370
seriously apologize to you.

328
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:55,180
I hope you can

329
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:57,090
give me a chance to make up, okay?

330
00:17:59,170 --> 00:17:59,580
It's too late.

331
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:01,370
I advise you

332
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:02,750
not to scheme to approach

333
00:18:02,770 --> 00:18:03,900
the people close to me.

334
00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:06,540
How am I scheming?

335
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:08,410
Do I have that much time?

336
00:18:08,710 --> 00:18:09,020
True.

337
00:18:09,850 --> 00:18:10,640
You are a busy man.

338
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:12,460
I'm really flattered

339
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:14,390
that you start to care about me.

340
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:16,540
Make it clear.

341
00:18:18,910 --> 00:18:20,120
Don't beat around the bush.

342
00:18:20,370 --> 00:18:21,300
Just leave me alone.

343
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:22,520
You didn't care about me before,

344
00:18:22,550 --> 00:18:23,390
and you don't need to care about me now!

345
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:24,170
You...

346
00:18:24,810 --> 00:18:25,780
Morning, sir.

347
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:28,270
Shen is here.

348
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:30,990
Did you come here so early in the morning

349
00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:32,210
just to pick a fight with your dad?

350
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:34,520
No.

351
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:37,560
He's here to learn from me

352
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:39,900
and discuss cooking with me, right?

353
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:42,690
Right, Dao?

354
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:45,060
Yes.

355
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,180
Masters,

356
00:18:49,210 --> 00:18:51,020
what's the way of competition today?

357
00:18:53,210 --> 00:18:54,940
Let's not compete today.

358
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:57,340
Today, we'll work together to make the dish "Treasure in the Snow".

359
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:01,650
L-Let's start then.

360
00:19:02,510 --> 00:19:02,860
Okay.

361
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:19,080
Add some MSG.

362
00:19:20,130 --> 00:19:20,700
MSG?

363
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:21,660
Yes.

364
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:24,280
Is this your secret?

365
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:26,650
We should maintain the savory flavor of the food itself

366
00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:28,410
instead of add mass-produced seasoning.

367
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:35,820
Isn't your salt mass-produced?

368
00:19:37,230 --> 00:19:37,740
Listen to me.

369
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:40,680
Here, add some MSG.

370
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,370
It'll be okay. Trust me.

371
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:24,890
Wait. Here.

372
00:20:34,330 --> 00:20:34,660
Here.

373
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,710
Mom always put in shrimp first.

374
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:41,240
Listen to me.

375
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:42,280
Stir-fry the ham first.

376
00:20:42,730 --> 00:20:43,750
Hurry up. It's going to burn.

377
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:58,880
Crab. Stir it.

378
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:01,170
Stir-fry.

379
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:07,350
Shrimp.

380
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:13,310
Let's put the thickened shrimp in the end

381
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:15,300
so that crab and ham

382
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:16,920
won't get the flavor of the starchy sauce.

383
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:17,930
That would be better.

384
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:19,310
But what if I use lard?

385
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:23,250
Try to cook with this oil this time, okay?

386
00:21:23,570 --> 00:21:24,680
Just listen to your dad.

387
00:21:24,870 --> 00:21:26,710
Maybe the result will be beyond your expectation.

388
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:27,420
Right.

389
00:21:28,110 --> 00:21:29,700
Come on. Stir-fry it.

390
00:21:58,390 --> 00:21:59,510
Let me try this.

391
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:07,510
It's delicious.

392
00:22:11,610 --> 00:22:12,450
Why aren't you eating?

393
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,500
It won't taste good

394
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:17,460
since it was guided by him.

395
00:22:19,950 --> 00:22:20,960
Smell it.

396
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:22,650
See if this "Treasure in the Snow"

397
00:22:22,670 --> 00:22:23,870
is different from other dishes.

398
00:22:41,050 --> 00:22:43,040
The shrimp tastes better and fresher.

399
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:45,950
Why is that?

400
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:49,580
You don't think the MSG is unnecessary anymore, right?

401
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,710
The taste of MSG is indeed gone.

402
00:22:56,530 --> 00:22:58,360
What tastes are left then?

403
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:04,720
The freshness of the ham

404
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:06,330
and the savory taste of the crab.

405
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:09,730
And they're passed to the shrimp by oil.

406
00:23:16,810 --> 00:23:17,930
Here, eat some more.

407
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:20,220
You too.

408
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:21,330
Thank you.

409
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:34,660
Dao, are you home?

410
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:36,840
Your dad asked me to bring you dinner.

411
00:23:38,190 --> 00:23:39,120
Why is nobody in?

412
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:40,630
Dad,

413
00:23:40,850 --> 00:23:41,850
when are you coming back?

414
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:43,450
What are you doing?

415
00:23:43,670 --> 00:23:44,820
What took you so long to answer the phone?

416
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:45,910
Tell me.

417
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:47,330
Did you watch TV secretly again?

418
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:49,270
Dad, I didn't.

419
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:51,650
I'm scared being alone at home.

420
00:23:51,990 --> 00:23:53,970
You are a man. What are you afraid of?

421
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:55,660
I've asked someone to bring you dinner.

422
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:56,610
Go and open the door.

423
00:23:57,070 --> 00:23:57,840
Okay, Dad.

424
00:23:59,130 --> 00:24:00,080
How was your exam?

425
00:24:01,010 --> 00:24:01,580
Full marks.

426
00:24:02,030 --> 00:24:02,850
Okay.

427
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:05,160
Zheng Youwei, where are you?

428
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:06,470
All right.

429
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:07,430
I'm hanging up.

430
00:24:41,290 --> 00:24:42,900
I'm sorry, Dao.

431
00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:45,690
I made all the custom-made set meals today,

432
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:47,970
but I didn't make it on time to see you off.

433
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:52,490
Good food contains warmth and love.

434
00:24:53,290 --> 00:24:54,640
It can also express a person's feelings.

435
00:24:55,420 --> 00:24:57,240
You don't feel anything special if you eat alone.

436
00:24:57,740 --> 00:24:59,190
But once someone waits for you at home,

437
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:00,290
and eats with you,

438
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:02,630
you will realize that life is well worth living.

439
00:25:03,570 --> 00:25:04,540
That is the taste of home.

440
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:05,630
Sir,

441
00:25:06,290 --> 00:25:07,660
I want to take a photo of you both.

442
00:25:10,110 --> 00:25:10,540
Sure.

443
00:25:11,970 --> 00:25:13,950
Come on.

444
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:15,950
Get a little closer.

445
00:25:16,430 --> 00:25:17,570
Look at the camera.

446
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:19,610
Look at the camera.

447
00:25:20,010 --> 00:25:22,380
Three, two, one.

448
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:24,180
Smile a little.

449
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:25,710
One more time.

450
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:27,030
One more time.

451
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:29,300
Three, two, one.

452
00:25:29,570 --> 00:25:30,220
Yeah!

453
00:25:32,690 --> 00:25:33,670
Sir, have a look.

454
00:25:34,610 --> 00:25:35,040
How is it?

455
00:25:37,490 --> 00:25:38,170
Isn't it great?

456
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:43,270
I didn't expect that every family has its own frustrations.

457
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:49,620
Every one of us

458
00:25:50,630 --> 00:25:51,900
buries our truest feelings

459
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:53,880
deep inside,

460
00:25:56,030 --> 00:25:58,070
turns our closest person away,

461
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:00,850
and makes our life like an isolated island.

462
00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:03,860
Shen Ying.

463
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:06,100
I thought about it.

464
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:09,660
The relationship between my father and I is so awkward.

465
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,280
I should be responsible for a larger part of it.

466
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:15,430
I have never thought about his feelings.

467
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:18,050
I just blamed everything on him.

468
00:26:19,390 --> 00:26:20,380
I should reflect on

469
00:26:20,410 --> 00:26:21,180
our relationship.

470
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:24,660
That's not what I want to say.

471
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:26,580
What I want to say is,

472
00:26:27,330 --> 00:26:28,700
no matter what you are like right now,

473
00:26:29,070 --> 00:26:30,070
no matter how your family

474
00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:32,680
has affected your personality,

475
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:34,890
you don't have to change yourself

476
00:26:35,870 --> 00:26:37,500
or be responsible for others' opinions.

477
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:40,120
As long as you feel comfortable,

478
00:26:42,130 --> 00:26:43,170
as long as your personality

479
00:26:43,730 --> 00:26:45,900
doesn't affect your life

480
00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:47,450
or your feelings,

481
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,370
what others think is not important at all.

482
00:26:55,430 --> 00:26:56,360
What matters is

483
00:26:56,620 --> 00:26:58,020
that you have to accept yourself

484
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:00,780
from the bottom of your heart.

485
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:04,500
And those who love you will love you forever.

486
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:07,140
They won't give up on you

487
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:08,980
just because you're different from others.

488
00:27:10,530 --> 00:27:13,180
At least you dad won't.

489
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:15,830
Neither will I.

490
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:20,190
Shen Ying.

491
00:27:21,590 --> 00:27:22,060
I love you.

492
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:33,930
Thank you.

493
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:41,710
Mr. Yu.

494
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:44,350
This is the latest issue of Isen Weekly.

495
00:27:56,060 --> 00:27:58,420
Our memory of taste can distinguish love and hate most clearly.

496
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:00,190
"Treasure in the Snow"

497
00:28:00,210 --> 00:28:01,910
is not just a simple dish.

498
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:03,770
It is the best proof of love

499
00:28:04,340 --> 00:28:05,330
between father and son.

500
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:21,520
[Zheng Youwei]

501
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:21,520
[You are welcome at any time.]

502
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:22,220
Thank you.

503
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:26,300
You're welcome. We're family.

504
00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:30,020
I've read the article.

505
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:30,940
It was quite good.

506
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:33,120
Treat Shen well.

507
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:40,410
We'll visit you when we're free.

508
00:29:03,730 --> 00:29:05,850
Let's have a chat if you're available.

509
00:29:08,930 --> 00:29:09,760
Sure.

510
00:29:10,730 --> 00:29:14,270
Let's talk while eating.

511
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:16,240
Let's go.

512
00:29:18,330 --> 00:29:20,650
[Restaurant Si]

513
00:29:18,810 --> 00:29:20,310
-Cheers. -Good job, all of you.

514
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:29,390
Why isn't Mr. Zheng here?

515
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:30,470
It's too late,

516
00:29:30,570 --> 00:29:31,300
so I let him rest.

517
00:29:31,780 --> 00:29:33,530
Let's go to his restaurant sometime.

518
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:35,060
I think his cooking

519
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:36,030
is much better than Zheng Dao's.

520
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,120
I agree.

521
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:38,940
I'm right here.

522
00:29:40,050 --> 00:29:40,820
But,

523
00:29:41,050 --> 00:29:42,210
sometimes I feel kind of weird

524
00:29:42,390 --> 00:29:43,900
to have a celebration dinner

525
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:45,530
without Yu Sicheng.

526
00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:47,740
Why are you bringing it up?

527
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:48,620
I'm just worried about

528
00:29:48,650 --> 00:29:49,850
the progress of my bestie's life stages.

529
00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:50,900
Shut up!

530
00:29:52,530 --> 00:29:53,200
Bai.

531
00:29:53,790 --> 00:29:55,340
Why don't you study but instead play with your phone?

532
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:56,750
I'm telling Yu Sicheng

533
00:29:56,780 --> 00:29:58,100
that Jian misses him.

534
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:01,920
Why don't you tell him

535
00:30:02,370 --> 00:30:04,090
that we all miss him?

536
00:30:04,630 --> 00:30:05,130
Sure.

537
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:06,680
Come on.

538
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:09,510
Cheers.

539
00:30:09,710 --> 00:30:10,020
Okay.

540
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:24,540
Everyone says they miss you.

541
00:30:28,570 --> 00:30:29,000
So,

542
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:32,000
do you miss me too?

543
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:38,430
Someone must be thinking about you.

544
00:30:39,590 --> 00:30:40,830
Say no more.

545
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:42,960
It must be Yu Sicheng.

546
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:46,500
Guys,

547
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:48,090
this is supposed to be a celebration dinner.

548
00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:49,940
Stop talking nonsense, okay?

549
00:30:50,990 --> 00:30:51,290
Yes.

550
00:30:51,770 --> 00:30:53,330
Come on, let's celebrate.

551
00:30:53,430 --> 00:30:54,280
Okay, cheers!

552
00:30:54,340 --> 00:30:54,920
Me too.

553
00:30:54,950 --> 00:30:55,740
Keep it up.

554
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:56,400
Keep up the good work.

555
00:31:00,730 --> 00:31:01,120
Morning.

556
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:01,480
Hello. Hello.

557
00:31:02,990 --> 00:31:03,380
Morning.

558
00:31:03,990 --> 00:31:04,910
It's strange.

559
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:06,870
Yu Sicheng hasn't been here these two days?

560
00:31:07,250 --> 00:31:08,520
Yu is on leave these days.

561
00:31:08,630 --> 00:31:09,260
Something came up at home.

562
00:31:10,770 --> 00:31:12,460
I haven't received the document I needed.

563
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:13,540
Forget it.

564
00:31:13,670 --> 00:31:14,550
I'll find someone else.

565
00:31:15,390 --> 00:31:18,090
He just made up his mind two days ago,

566
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:19,960
and yet he's disappeared now

567
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:21,650
even without notice.

568
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:24,680
I don't know what he's up to.

569
00:31:25,330 --> 00:31:25,680
See?

570
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:28,090
Photographer Zhuang is getting anxious.

571
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:29,980
Yu is someone.

572
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:31,630
This must be the legendary unfailing

573
00:31:31,670 --> 00:31:33,320
trick of playing hard to get.

574
00:31:34,850 --> 00:31:35,630
What?

575
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:37,230
What did you find out?

576
00:31:37,830 --> 00:31:38,820
Tell me.

577
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:40,880
You won't understand.

578
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:42,720
Zhang, Qi,

579
00:31:43,330 --> 00:31:45,080
if you can't finish the articles

580
00:31:45,110 --> 00:31:46,260
tonight,

581
00:31:46,430 --> 00:31:47,350
you can meet me with your head in your hand tomorrow.

582
00:31:47,930 --> 00:31:48,830
We're on it.

583
00:32:06,630 --> 00:32:07,310
Zhuang Yan,

584
00:32:07,750 --> 00:32:08,330
are you off work?

585
00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:09,830
Would you please come to this place?

586
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:10,970
I'll send you the address.

587
00:32:14,690 --> 00:32:15,220
What is it?

588
00:32:18,670 --> 00:32:19,120
It's a secret.

589
00:32:19,810 --> 00:32:20,520
You must come!

590
00:32:21,150 --> 00:32:22,280
You won't regret it.
