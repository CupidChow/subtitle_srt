00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:30,490
barely improving?

176
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:32,290
They're all going to that newly opened

177
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,890
Restaurant Weijia across the street.

178
00:07:42,090 --> 00:07:43,080
What are you two doing?

179
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:45,310
Chef Dong.

180
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:46,900
Are you that free?

181
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:48,930
Have you checked the dishes in the kitchen?

182
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:50,690
We've checked several times already.

183
00:07:52,450 --> 00:07:53,000
Exactly.

184
00:07:53,409 --> 00:07:54,540
Even on a Saturday,

185
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:56,620
we're not having many customers in the morning.

186
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:57,960
We've been idle for a while now.

187
00:07:58,510 --> 00:07:59,300
That's right.

188
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,240
It's getting quieter here.

189
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:11,180
Listen, you two...

190
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:12,220
Hey,

191
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:14,140
you two work hard, okay?

192
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:24,020
Hello, miss.

193
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:30,360
Hello, miss. Welcome.

194

Hello, miss,

195
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:32,059
how many people, please?

196
00:08:33,049 --> 00:08:34,049
Is this your first time here?

197
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:35,070
Do you need

198
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:36,090
any recommendations?

199
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:37,620
Please.

200
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:40,679
Miss,

201
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,130
here's our menu.

202
00:08:42,289 --> 00:08:42,940
Please have a look.

203
00:08:43,409 --> 00:08:44,660
Can I order something not on the menu?

204
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:47,740
We'll need to check with our chef.

205
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:49,580
Normally, our custom-made sets

206
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:51,140
-require... -Please ask your chef then.

207
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:52,440
I'd like

208
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:54,020
a Rose Mont Blanc.

209
00:08:55,330 --> 00:08:57,610
And... that is all?

210
00:08:58,260 --> 00:08:58,570
Yes.

211
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:00,140
Okay.

here's the order ticket.

214

what's up with Chef Zheng?

219
00:09:16,270 --> 00:09:17,990
I smell danger.

220
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:20,970
Is Ying getting a rival in love?

221
00:09:21,050 --> 00:09:21,940
I think so.

222
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:22,990
And a strong one, too.

223
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:25,140
Hello.

224
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:26,200
How can I help you?

225
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:27,330
I'd like to see the bracelets.

226
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,160
Okay, this way.

227
00:09:29,710 --> 00:09:32,070
There's this one called "Peace Angel."

228
00:09:34,930 --> 00:09:35,860
May I try it on?

229
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:36,310
Sure.

230
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:40,660
The size is right.

231
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:43,580
Are there any bracelets for couples?

232
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:44,050
Yes.

233
00:09:44,170 --> 00:09:44,770
I'll get them for you.

234
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:45,660
Okay.

235
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:48,060

Thank you.

Please have a try.

238
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:05,570
What's wrong, ma'am?

239
00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:07,290
Are you not happy with it?

240
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:08,590
It's not that.

241
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:09,940
It's good.

242
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:11,940
But the taste has changed.

243
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:14,140
There's sea salt in it now.

244
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:17,400
I'm really sorry.

245

Shall we make you another one?

00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:21,270
No need.

The bill, please.

00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:24,950
Sorry.

I'll get it.

That woman just now.

00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,720
Might have been left by a female guest just now.

264

A female guest?

265
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,230
She only ordered a Rose Mont Blanc.

Why don't we

278

skip this competition?

279
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:34,600
We can figure something else out.

280
00:12:37,650 --> 00:12:39,160
This is an opportunity for us

Have a seat.

293
00:13:16,450 --> 00:13:17,650
I went to buy milk tea.

294
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,150
Didn't I tell you

295
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:20,110
not to drink this?

296
00:13:20,370 --> 00:13:20,970
Try it.

297

This one is really good.

298
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:22,870
I queued for a long time

299
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:23,710
and I haven't tried it yet.

300
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:24,990
I saved the first sip for you.

301
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:31,020
How is it?

302
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,210
I think there's a lot of sugar in it.

303
00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:36,390
You're lying.

304
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:39,900
It's good.

305
00:13:41,650 --> 00:13:42,060
Okay.

306
00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:43,330
It's good if you like it.

307
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:45,620
But it's really not that healthy.

308
00:13:46,030 --> 00:13:46,820
Try to go easy on that.

309
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:52,980
So, why did you want to see me?

310
00:13:53,270 --> 00:13:53,680
Right.

311
00:13:55,430 --> 00:13:56,910
I have a gift for you.

312
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,320
A love lock.

313
00:14:09,830 --> 00:14:12,310
A couples' handcuff that will lock up your freedom.

314
00:14:13,370 --> 00:14:14,100
Give me your hand.

315
00:14:14,450 --> 00:14:14,940
Let me put it on for you.

316
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:18,280
Here.

317
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:25,490
I have one too.

318
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:27,400
It's a couple set?

319
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:30,020
They're pretty.

320
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:33,180
I picked a simple design.

321
00:14:33,370 --> 00:14:34,500
So you can wear it at work.

322
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:36,260
If you dare to take it off,

323
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:38,860
I'll beat you.

324
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:44,670
Don't worry.

325
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:45,820
I won't take it off.

326
00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:48,970
This is the first time I've received

327
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:50,530
such a meaningful gift.

328
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:54,200
By the way, what is this?

329
00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:55,260
Why is there only half a heart?

330
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:57,460
I have the other half.

331
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:00,600
You can snap the two halves together

332
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:02,630
and make it a complete heart.

333
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:04,690
And then,

334
00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:07,220
you'll be locked by me.

335
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:11,580
I like being locked by you.

336
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:30,350
Aren't they pretty?

337
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:41,910
This is the annual Golden Fritillaria Competition.

338
00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:44,850

00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,120
Yes.

340
00:15:47,170 --> 00:15:47,970
That means

341
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:49,380
we'll get to taste

343
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:53,210

00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:54,730
experience something like that.

345
00:15:56,010 --> 00:15:57,780
I'm willing to do anything for Isen!

346
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:00,900
This is serious business.

347
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:03,450
We got invited by the organizers

348
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:05,820
because of the popularity of our food column.

349
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:09,840
Director Zheng and Shen Ying have contributed greatly to this.

350
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:16,610
From what I've heard,

351
00:16:17,330 --> 00:16:19,050
this year's Golden Fritillaria Competition

352
00:16:19,190 --> 00:16:20,380
has raised its criteria.

353
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:22,900
Every nominated restaurant

354
00:16:23,130 --> 00:16:25,170
will be visited by judges incognito.

355
00:16:25,690 --> 00:16:26,680
And the jury

356
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:29,280
is more diverse and younger in average age.

357
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:31,020
I suppose...

358
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:33,800
Director Zheng

359
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:35,860
will want to keep a low profile for a bit.

360
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:37,010
Of course.

361
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:39,340
As for Shen Ying,

362
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:41,820
she's experienced in gastronomical exploration.

363
00:16:42,170 --> 00:16:43,170
You're all aware of

364
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:44,760
the click-through rates

365
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:45,820
of her previous articles.

366
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:48,240
I thought long and hard

367
00:16:48,490 --> 00:16:49,220
before landing on

368
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,670
the decision that I think is the best for Isen.

369
00:16:51,850 --> 00:16:52,380
Therefore,

370
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:54,380
I nominated Shen Ying

371
00:16:54,810 --> 00:16:57,420
as the opinion leader in gastronomy this time.

372
00:16:58,500 --> 00:16:59,540
Do you have any objections?

373
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:00,300
No.

374
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:01,550
No.

375
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:04,780
I think it makes sense.

376
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:05,339
Okay.

377
00:17:05,869 --> 00:17:06,730
It's settled then.

378
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:08,190
Shen Ying,

379
00:17:08,490 --> 00:17:09,800
come to my office later.

380
00:17:11,099 --> 00:17:11,619
That's all for now.

381
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:14,119
Let's go.

382
00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:14,950
Let's go.

383
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:24,290
Don't worry.

384
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:25,599
I'll be there.

385
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:36,210
Come in.

386
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:45,900
I don't think I've fully understood what you were saying

387
00:17:46,770 --> 00:17:47,980
during the meeting.

388
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:49,180
I knew you wouldn't.

389
00:17:49,370 --> 00:17:50,320
That's why I asked you to come.

390
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:52,380
It was my decision to have you

391
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,540
participate in the competition

392
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:54,560
on behalf of Isen.

393
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:56,620
In the competition,

394
00:17:57,140 --> 00:17:58,100
you're expected

395
00:17:58,120 --> 00:17:59,730
to show the professionalism of our food column.

396
00:18:00,210 --> 00:18:01,020
Don't let me down.

397
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:02,420
Thank you for giving me this opportunity.

398
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:04,270
But there're still a few questions

399
00:18:04,290 --> 00:18:05,370
I wish you could answer.

400
00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:06,600
Go ahead.

401
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:07,700
I think everyone knows

402
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,840
that Director Zheng surpasses me

403
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:10,730
in both professionalism

404
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:11,510
and influence.

405
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:12,780
Why did you choose me?

406
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:15,520
I have my reasons.

407
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:18,460
You've always been someone I value.

408
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:21,140
And everyone has seen your progress

409
00:18:21,390 --> 00:18:22,630
in the food column.

410
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:24,120
So what's wrong?

411
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:25,460
Being timid

412
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:27,140
is not your style.

413
00:18:28,530 --> 00:18:29,120
But still,

414
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,680
I'm only an editor.

415
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:34,020
Director Zheng is much more experienced.

416
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:36,780
Shen Ying,

417
00:18:38,670 --> 00:18:40,510
I believe you're aware of the negative press

418
00:18:40,770 --> 00:18:41,970
surrounding Director Zheng lately.

419
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:43,060
If I'm honest,

420
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:45,540
it's not only affecting himself,

421
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:47,020
but it's also had

422
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:48,570
much negative impact on Isen.

423
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,610
So the higher-ups think that,

424
00:18:50,890 --> 00:18:51,980
for the time being,

425
00:18:52,490 --> 00:18:53,940
it's not suitable for him

426
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:55,640
to attend public events on behalf of Isen.

427
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:57,250
Besides,

428
00:18:57,380 --> 00:18:58,380
although you're less experienced,

429
00:18:58,590 --> 00:18:59,650
I trust your ability.

430
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,240
I promoted you myself.

431
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:05,330
Are you questioning my judgment?

432
00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:06,420
No, Miranda.

433
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:07,740
I didn't mean that.

434
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:11,340
I see it now.

435
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:13,770
I will show my professionalism

436
00:19:13,970 --> 00:19:14,880
participating in the competition

437
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:16,420
on behalf of Isen.

438
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,780
That's the Shen Ying I know.

439
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:20,480
As for the details,

440
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:21,740
I'll ask the jury

441
00:19:21,770 --> 00:19:22,500
to get in touch with you.

442
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:23,380
No problem.

443
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:25,350
In this year's competition,

444
00:19:25,450 --> 00:19:26,920
there's a judge of particular importance

445
00:19:27,210 --> 00:19:27,940
called Han Feizi.

446
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:29,520
She just came back from France.

447
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:32,100
Do your homework in advance

448
00:19:32,190 --> 00:19:33,400
and make her acquaintance.

449
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:34,900
Han Feizi?

450
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:36,970
Do you know her?

451
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:39,670
But I think

452
00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:41,630
I have seen this name somewhere.

453
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:45,820
It's only normal that you've seen this name.

454
00:19:46,870 --> 00:19:48,060
While she was in France,

455
00:19:48,370 --> 00:19:49,870
it took only one dessert

456
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:52,020
for her to become a WPTC

457
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:52,740
champion.

458
00:19:53,090 --> 00:19:54,410
She is also a famous figure

459
00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:55,760
in Europe's food scene.

460
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:57,150
Besides,

461
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,080
her gastronomical and industry insight

462
00:19:59,100 --> 00:19:59,980
is also invaluable.

463
00:20:00,770 --> 00:20:01,900
If you can learn something from her,

464
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:03,700
then not only our company,

465
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:05,140
but you yourself in the long run,

466
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:06,550
will benefit from it.

467
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:08,770
This is also a decision made by the higher-ups.

468
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:10,080
Okay, I see.

469
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:12,300
If there's nothing else,

470
00:20:12,610 --> 00:20:13,220
I'll be off now.

471
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:14,320
Go ahead.

472
00:20:26,730 --> 00:20:27,590
Go get the car.

473
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:28,200
Okay, Mr. Yu.

474
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:31,770
Mr. Yu,

475
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:32,460
it's all set.

476
00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:33,310
It's someone from my team.

477
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:35,280
And no one is suspicious about

478
00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:36,780
why Zheng Dao won't be a judge?

479
00:20:37,090 --> 00:20:38,500
He's already in too much trouble himself

480
00:20:39,090 --> 00:20:40,530
to think about these things now.

481
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:42,110
As befits you, Ms. Lin.

482
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:43,890
Very thorough indeed.

483
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:46,810
And you will keep

484
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:48,460
your promise?

485
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:50,450
Ms. Lin,

486
00:20:51,870 --> 00:20:53,130
since we started this cooperation,

487
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:55,430
we're in this together.

488
00:20:56,270 --> 00:20:56,870
Rest assured.

489
00:20:57,650 --> 00:20:58,420
You too.

490
00:20:59,930 --> 00:21:00,350
Bye.

491
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,040
It's such a good thing.

492
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:46,640
Why is she looking depressed?

493
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:47,570
Yeah.

494
00:21:47,790 --> 00:21:48,700
What could a judge-to-be

495
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:49,640
be unhappy about?

496
00:21:50,230 --> 00:21:50,870
Something's wrong.

497
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:53,470
I think I smell gossip.

498
00:21:56,110 --> 00:21:57,310
Is it because of Director Zheng Dao?

499
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:58,670
Why are you here?

500
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:00,460
We are all friends.

501
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:01,490
We spill the tea.

502
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:04,370
By the way, isn't Director Zheng Dao

503
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:06,270
not doing so well lately career-wise?

504
00:22:07,290 --> 00:22:08,420
It seems Miranda's trying

505
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:10,290
to make a clean break with him.

506
00:22:10,870 --> 00:22:11,630
I think so.

507
00:22:12,510 --> 00:22:14,900
Ying and Director Zheng are a couple,

508
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:17,830
and Director Zheng is apparently being targeted.

509
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:20,690
It seems Miranda's got a "women's alliance" going on.

510
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:22,710
Then the two of us will have no way out.

511
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:24,790
What should we do?

512
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:27,340
Is my career doomed now?

513
00:22:27,710 --> 00:22:28,550
I was still hoping

514
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:29,980
to taste some desserts from the competition.

515
00:22:31,710 --> 00:22:32,950
How very ambitious!

516
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:35,940
You three,

517
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:37,780
before you get off work,

518
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:39,440
sort out and give me the sales data

519
00:22:39,470 --> 00:22:40,070
of last year.

520
00:22:40,630 --> 00:22:41,160
Okay.

521
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:42,250
All right.

522
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:44,060
Let's go.

523
00:22:44,310 --> 00:22:45,020
It's on you!

524
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:06,710
How's the investigation going?

525
00:23:07,810 --> 00:23:09,380
Zheng Dao has accepted the invitation.

526
00:23:10,010 --> 00:23:11,200
He will participate as a chef

527
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:13,510
on behalf of Si in the Golden Fritillaria Competition.

528
00:23:15,570 --> 00:23:16,100
Sure enough,

529
00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:17,980
he's still the Zheng Dao I know.

530
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:19,710
But...

531
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:21,360
there's someone called Shen Ying,

532
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:23,930
who will also be one of the expert judges.

533
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:25,260
From what I've learned,

534
00:23:25,670 --> 00:23:26,920
her connection with Zheng Dao

535
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,000
is not a simple one.

536
00:23:31,090 --> 00:23:32,470
Shen Ying?

537
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:40,180
Oh my god!

538
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:41,460
That's quite some accomplishment.

539
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:45,900
The champion of WPTC in 2016.

540
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:49,480
WPTC stands for World Pastry Team Championship.

541
00:23:49,510 --> 00:23:50,950
It's held every two years,

542
00:23:50,970 --> 00:23:52,950
and is, alongside the World Pastry Cup,

543
00:23:52,990 --> 00:23:54,230
which is held in Lyon in the next year,

544
00:23:54,250 --> 00:23:55,880
one of the most important pastry competitions.

545
00:23:55,950 --> 00:23:59,000
It's a grand event that showcases

546
00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:01,290
the highest level of dessert-making in the world.

547
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:03,700
What have I done

548
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:06,150
to deserve this chance to be a fellow judge of hers?

549
00:24:07,490 --> 00:24:08,170
She's pretty.

550
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:10,230
Reading gossips during working hours?

551
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:12,940
How did you walk without making any sound?

552
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:14,070
You scared me.

553
00:24:14,930 --> 00:24:15,560
Sis,

554
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:17,080
I've been behind you for a while.

555
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:18,360
How did you not realize?

556
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:19,840
What's wrong?

557
00:24:20,970 --> 00:24:23,600
Haven't you become a judge of the Golden Fritillaria Competition?

558
00:24:23,810 --> 00:24:25,010
Having expert issues?

559
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:27,680
Don't you know my little tricks?

560
00:24:27,870 --> 00:24:29,070
Only useful for writing articles.

561
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:30,550
Can't make me an expert.

562
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:33,800
Why did you read his ex-girlfriend's bio then?

563
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:35,040
Sensing some crisis?

564
00:24:37,130 --> 00:24:38,000
Ex-girlfriend? Who?

565
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:44,390
You mean, Han Feizi

566
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,640
is Zheng Dao's ex-girlfriend?

567
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:51,370
Honestly, sis,

568
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,880
will you use your head?

569
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,240
You really have a strong enemy this time.

570
00:24:55,850 --> 00:24:56,640
Very fierce indeed.

571
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:57,430
How did you know?

572
00:24:58,660 --> 00:25:00,740
Jojo and Yoyo spilled it, of course.

573
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:02,960
You're probably the only one at Si who doesn’t know.

574
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:05,180
And I have another thing to tell you.

575
00:25:05,410 --> 00:25:06,240
Si is also

576
00:25:06,490 --> 00:25:08,260
participating in the competition.

577
00:25:09,070 --> 00:25:11,310
And Han Feizi recommended it herself.

578
00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:14,110
Si is participating in the competition?

579
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:15,860
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

580
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:16,590
Stop it.

581
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:17,750
Calm down.

582
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:20,500
It wasn't easy for Si either.

583
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:22,240
They're in great danger this time.

584
00:25:23,050 --> 00:25:24,280
All right, don't worry.

585
00:25:24,430 --> 00:25:25,310
If anything happens,

586
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:27,860
you can lean on my shoulder.

587
00:25:28,210 --> 00:25:29,200
"Lean on your shoulder"?

588
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:31,930
Is that even strong enough?

589
00:25:32,510 --> 00:25:33,910
Talking about "leaning on."

590
00:25:33,970 --> 00:25:35,140
You're the last person

591
00:25:35,330 --> 00:25:36,220
that I can lean on.

592
00:25:36,250 --> 00:25:36,760
You realize?

593
00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:38,150
Well... excuse me?

594
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:39,680
Live streaming?

595
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:40,840
Don't touch anything.

596
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:41,890
I'm coming to tidy it up for you.

597
00:25:56,210 --> 00:25:57,050
I have something to tell you.

598
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:58,810
I'll send you the address.

599
00:25:58,840 --> 00:25:59,600
Come after work,

600
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:00,520
okay?

601
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:01,900
Not showing up for the entire day,

602
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:03,200
and now you ask me to come.

603
00:26:04,290 --> 00:26:05,050
What's all this?

604
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:20,810
-Thank you, sir. -Take care.

605
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:22,400
Hello,

606
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:23,730
are you Miss Shen Ying?

607
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:24,670
Yes.

608
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:26,370
Mr. Zheng Dao has made a reservation.

609
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:27,290
Please follow me.

610
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:28,090
Okay.

611
00:26:28,810 --> 00:26:29,720
What's the deal

612
00:26:29,930 --> 00:26:30,790
with all this ceremony?

613
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:17,710
Honey,

614
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:19,930
happy anniversary.

615
00:27:30,330 --> 00:27:31,670
You prepared all this?

616
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:33,930
Do you like it?

617
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:40,410
It's kind of cheesy.

618
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:42,600
But...

619
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:45,810
I like it.

620
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:56,420
Do you have something to tell me?

621
00:27:58,620 --> 00:27:59,280
First,

622
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:02,230
as you're going to be a judge of the Golden Fritillaria Competition,

623
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:04,340
I know you're under pressure,

624
00:28:05,090 --> 00:28:05,830
but I believe

625
00:28:06,130 --> 00:28:07,490
you'll do very well.

626
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:13,680
Second,

627
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:15,200
I've decided

628
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:17,900
to let Si participate in this competition too.

629
00:28:21,410 --> 00:28:22,650
Have you decided?

630
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:25,450
As a chef?

631
00:28:26,470 --> 00:28:27,390
I have.

632
00:28:28,610 --> 00:28:29,120
And so

633
00:28:29,870 --> 00:28:31,680
I wanted to tell you this in person today.

634
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:34,400
Shen Ying,

635
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:37,390
what I really want to tell you is,

636
00:28:38,890 --> 00:28:41,440
the reason why I'm participating in the competition

637
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:42,480
as a chef

638
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:45,160
is first and foremost you.

639
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:47,400
You gave me the motivation.

640
00:28:48,130 --> 00:28:49,980
You healed me with your warmth.

641
00:28:51,890 --> 00:28:52,930
You helped me regain

642
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:56,230
my passion for food and my confidence,

643
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:59,500
and taught me the true meaning of food.

644
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:01,690
In the past 100 days,

645
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:05,010
you gave me so much more

646
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:09,160
than what you might think you did.

647
00:29:10,690 --> 00:29:11,940
I want to restore Si's reputation

648
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:15,790
with my own efforts.

649
00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:26,910
I didn't know I was so important to you.

650
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:31,040
You took advantage of me.

651
00:29:33,130 --> 00:29:33,640
Yes.

652
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:35,440
I'm lucky

653
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:38,340
to have taken advantage of you.

654
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:45,960
Judge Shen,

655
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:47,830
here's to you.

656
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:51,440
Congratulations on your comeback, Chef Zheng.

657
00:31:08,150 --> 00:31:09,220
Bustling about

658
00:31:09,770 --> 00:31:10,680
in the ocean of life.

659
00:31:11,790 --> 00:31:13,670
Happiness is probably where I'm at.

660
00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:15,460
Repeat.

661
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:18,000
Repeating everything gladly.

662
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:21,170
Every day, with the people I love,

663
00:31:21,650 --> 00:31:23,450
working, eating, chatting.

664
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:25,280
Repeating promises and dreams.

665
00:31:26,410 --> 00:31:27,730
Preparing for the Golden Fritillaria Competition

666
00:31:27,790 --> 00:31:29,220
has been a major change for me.

667
00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:31,890
I can really feel my world

668
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:33,190
changing again.

669
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:35,330
The difference is,

670
00:31:36,050 --> 00:31:36,780
this time,

671
00:31:37,650 --> 00:31:39,530
we are with the people we love.

672
00:31:43,810 --> 00:31:46,480
Life is about sharing the day's meals

673
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:47,720
with the people I love,

674
00:31:48,850 --> 00:31:50,550
and feeling the gentleness and happiness

675
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:52,740
in each other's eyes in our free time.

676
00:31:54,890 --> 00:31:56,270
I think I'm starting to believe in fate.

677
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:58,400
Because it's him.

678
00:32:00,410 --> 00:32:02,580
If this is fate,

679
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:05,500
I'm willing to start over and over again.

680
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:09,260
To meet him and fall in love with him.

681
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,200
How is the competition going?

682
00:32:22,830 --> 00:32:23,630
As far as we know,

683
00:32:24,210 --> 00:32:25,520
Si has confirmed that it will participate.

684
00:32:25,930 --> 00:32:26,770
