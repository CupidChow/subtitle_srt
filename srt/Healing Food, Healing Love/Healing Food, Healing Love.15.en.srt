00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:37,020
Restaurant Si is opening soon.

4
00:01:37,039 --> 00:01:38,430
Whether they can salvage their reputation,

5
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:39,650
let's wait and see.

6
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:48,780
Stop the business! No reopening!

7
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:51,940
-Stop the business! No reopening! -Let's enter from the back door.

8
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:55,140
Stop the business! No reopening!

9
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:56,860
Stop the business! No reopening!

10
00:01:59,289 --> 00:01:59,880
Here you are.

11
00:02:02,110 --> 00:02:02,480
Yes.

12
00:02:04,010 --> 00:02:04,940
Director Zheng.

13
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:06,790
Are you going to treat us to a meal?

14
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:07,750
No problem.

15
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:10,220
Let's get down to business.

16
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:11,090
Of course.

17
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:12,610
Director Zheng knows that

18
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:13,600
he needs to buy us a meal when he has a girlfriend.

19
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:14,560
What about you?

20
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:15,750
I will.

21
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:16,500
I will definitely do it.

22
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:19,560
You're just an intern. Why do you want to treat us?

23
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:21,950
It's because I stole you from them.

24
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:23,860
Then, I'll pay half of the bill.

25
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:25,400
You are always right.

26
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:27,020
Enough. Zheng Dao.

27
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:28,270
Go to work in the kitchen.

28
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:29,010
Got it.

29
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:30,310
Let's go.

30
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:33,660
Chop. Chop.

31
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:37,310
We should get back to work.

32
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:38,110
Professor Yang is here.

33
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:38,910
I'll go pick him up.

34
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:40,060
Let me do it. I'll go.

35
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:40,780
Thanks.

36
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:41,550
Thank you.

37
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:42,100
-It's alright. -Thanks.

38
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:43,970
Mr. Fang,

39
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:46,200
the lamb chops you ordered are here.

40
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,260
-Thank you. Thank you. -These are our lamb chops.

41
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:49,460
Well,

42
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:50,500
we've prepared roast duck

43
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:51,960
for you today.

44
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:52,660
At the lounge.

45
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:54,329
What about taking a rest there?

46
00:02:54,730 --> 00:02:55,500
It's too troublesome.

47
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:57,050
It's not a big deal. It's really nothing.

48
00:02:57,579 --> 00:02:58,380
Right, Chef Dong?

49
00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:00,310
Right, roast duck.

50
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:01,980
This way, please.

51
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:02,720
Yes. Thank you.

52
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:03,520
Thank you. This way.

53
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:04,670
Thank you. Thank you so much.

54
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:05,450
You're welcome.

55
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:05,980
Come on.

56
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:06,690
This way, please.

57
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:09,970
Fang.

58
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:12,860
This way.

59
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:13,610
Professor Yang.

60
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:16,110
-Hello. -Nice to meet you.

61
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:17,850
Would you like to take a rest before we start?

62
00:03:17,890 --> 00:03:19,010
I can work anytime.

63
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:20,220
That'd be great.

64
00:03:20,829 --> 00:03:22,079
Well, are we ready?

65
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:22,900
Almost.

66
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:23,500
It's okay.

67
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:24,780
Then let's...

68
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:25,180
No problem.

69
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:25,620
Get started.

70
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:29,860
Please come in.

71
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:30,420
Let's go.

72
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:32,320
This is the internal condition.

73
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:33,110
Ladies and gentlemen,

74
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:35,070
we're inside Restaurant Si.

75
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:39,440
Shutting down and remediating!

76
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:39,860
Mr Yu.

77
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:41,290
The live stream is about to begin.

78
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,890
Hello, everyone.

79
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:47,130
This is Isen Magazine's live stream.

80
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:49,829
I'm your old friend, Fan Jian.

81
00:03:50,579 --> 00:03:52,230
Why is Young Mr. Yu here?

82
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:53,510
...the reopening day.

83
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:56,430
Today, Isen will be live broadcasting

84
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:57,750
the brand-new plan of Restaurant Si.

85
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:58,900
What Young Mr. Yu?

86
00:03:59,050 --> 00:03:59,890
Next, let's welcome...

87
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:01,390
He's just a worker now.

88
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:04,210
Mr. Fang Siwei to make an introduction.

89
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:05,730
Let's give him a big round of applause.

90
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:08,130
Isn't this the work he asked for?

91
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:09,260
Dear media...

92
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:10,910
He has no ambition at all.

93
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,520
I'm the owner of Restaurant Si, Fang Siwei.

94
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:14,560
First,

95
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:17,399
I would like to apologize to you for the issue

96
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:20,510
on behalf of the whole members from Restaurant Si.

97
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:23,060
Today,

98
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:25,090
in front of you,

99
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:26,720
we will remake

100
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:28,300
our signature dish,

101
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:29,400
Lamb Chop with Lobsters.

102
00:04:29,890 --> 00:04:31,400
We will invite media

103
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:35,020
and audience to be our witnesses.

104
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:38,090
Who has the guts to eat your food after the food poisoning incident?

105
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,640
Yeah, who dares to?

106
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:40,640
Do you have the nerve?

107
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:43,170
I dare not.

108
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:43,700
Everyone,

109
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,760
I know you must have concerns about this.

110
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:49,320
So for our production today,

111
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:50,440
we've invited

112
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:52,650
an expert on food safety

113
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:56,570
who will supervise, inspect and guide us during the whole process.

114
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:57,790
That's more like it.

115
00:04:58,010 --> 00:04:58,830
More like it?

116
00:04:59,030 --> 00:04:59,920
What if he's an accomplice?

117
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:00,960
Right.

118
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:03,150
Let's welcome the professor

119
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:05,790
of the Food Safety Department from East China University,

120
00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:07,260
Professor Yang Minglin.

121
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:10,490
I don't know who the professor is.

122
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:11,900
Hello, everyone.

123
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,150
My name is Yang Minglin.

124
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,860
Today's test will be carried out meticulously

125
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:17,700
according to the national standard

126
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:20,170
and I will reveal the result to the public.

127
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:21,860
Please rest assured.

128
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:26,490
Who is Yang Minglin?

129
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:27,440
Let me search him online.

130
00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:35,090
He is indeed a professor at East China University.

131
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:36,500
But

132
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:37,950
we have plan B.

133
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:40,860
So today,

134
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:42,830
under the supervision of Professor Yang,

135
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:44,280
if our dish

136
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:46,659
has any problems,

137
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,930
I will close the restaurant immediately

138
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:50,010
to show we're a responsible team.

139
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:53,560
Thank you.

140
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:54,220
Here, Professor.

141
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:54,650
All right.

142
00:05:54,890 --> 00:05:56,210
Taking account of

143
00:05:56,330 --> 00:05:56,820
food hygiene,

144
00:05:57,010 --> 00:05:58,409
only Isen's photographer team

145
00:05:58,430 --> 00:05:59,020
can enter.

146
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:00,070
Other media

147
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:01,460
can watch it on our big screen.

148
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:04,690
There will be live stream on the inspection in the kitchen.

149
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:05,330
Thank you.

150
00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:11,560
Okay, everyone.

151
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:14,400
This is the kitchen of Restaurant Si.

152
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:16,500
We can see that this is the refrigerator.

153
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:17,580
Professor Yang

154
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:19,060
is testing carefully.

155
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:19,910
Okay.

156
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:20,980
Camera, follow us.

157
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,040
This is the place

158
00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:26,590
where every delicious dish is produced.

159
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:28,800
This should be the lobster

160
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:30,350
they're going to cook.

161
00:06:31,210 --> 00:06:31,620
Alright.

162
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,440
Let me ask Chef Zheng Dao.

163
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:34,740
Do you have any tips

164
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:36,340
when you select the lobster?

165
00:06:36,690 --> 00:06:38,620
When we choose ingredients,

166
00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:39,400
we will always uphold the principle

167
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:41,230
that we will select fresh and premium ones hygienically.

168
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:42,560
During our selection of the lobster this time,

169
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:44,040
we chose between a Australian lobster

170
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:44,840
and a Canadian one.

171
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:45,580
Finally,

172
00:06:45,790 --> 00:06:47,260
we selected the latter.

173
00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:48,760
Because the ocean where it grew

174
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:49,970
is pure and cold,

175
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:52,200
thus, it is fresher and firmer.

176
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:54,630
It will be more delicious with the lamb chop.

177
00:06:54,730 --> 00:06:55,170
Yes.

178
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:57,020
This is our test result certificate.

179
00:06:57,550 --> 00:06:58,290
It must be

180
00:06:58,510 --> 00:07:00,770
in accordance with the national food safety regulations.

181
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:01,880
You can take a look.

182
00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:03,510
Sicheng,

183
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:04,910
show it to Professor Yang.

184
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:06,020
Okay.

185
00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:07,110
Ladies and gentlemen,

186
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:08,580
considering confidential information,

187
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:10,260
we will blur some details

188
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:11,570
on the document

189
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,160
-and present it to you online. -Fighting.

190
00:07:13,530 --> 00:07:13,960
All right.

191
00:07:14,570 --> 00:07:15,240
Let's turn back here.

192
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:18,660
Chef Zheng Dao,

193
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:20,520
are the lamb chops you just mentioned

194
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:21,860
imported from abroad

195
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,440
as the lobster was?

196
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:24,870
Actually, no.

197
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:26,230
Our lamb chops

198
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:28,020
have always been provided by Weijia Group.

199
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:29,390
Just like this one,

200
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:30,810
it was just sent by Weijia Group.

201
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:32,360
Excuse me,

202
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:34,520
is this the spare ingredient?

203
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:35,960
No.

204
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:38,030
This is the lamb chop

205
00:07:38,170 --> 00:07:39,580
provided by another supplier.

206
00:07:40,659 --> 00:07:41,240
I see.

207
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:42,050
Okay.

208
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:43,380
Let's move up the camera.

209
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:44,640
Dear audience,

210
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:46,470
we can see that Professor Yang

211
00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:47,990
is still conducting a detailed examination.

212
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:49,720
We will show it to the viewers

213
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:51,070
through picture in picture.

214
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:52,400
If you're interested,

215
00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:54,310
please watch it

216
00:07:54,409 --> 00:07:55,170
at the bottom-right corner of the screen.

217
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:56,180
All right.

218
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,010
Let's turn back.

219
00:07:57,950 --> 00:07:59,290
This is Chef Zheng Dao

220
00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:00,320
we've just mentioned.

221
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:02,130
He is also the mysterious and renowned chef

222
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:04,270
of Restaurant Si.

223
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:04,990
Today,

224
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:06,380
he will personally make

225
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:08,050
Lamb Chop with Lobster for us.

226
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:09,710
Then Chef Zheng,

227
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:11,310
before cooking this dish,

228
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:12,580
do you have anything

229
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,240
to tell the audience?

230
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:16,900
No.

231
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:18,660
Please wait for the dish.

232
00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:20,060
OK. Thank you.

233
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,700
Mr. Fang,

234
00:08:22,170 --> 00:08:22,860
do you have any heads-ups

235
00:08:22,890 --> 00:08:24,650
for Chef Zheng Dao?

236
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:26,240
I'm 100 percent confident in

237
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:28,080
Chef Zheng's ability.

238
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,070
Mr. Fang.

239
00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:31,180
If the production of this dish is disclosed,

240
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:33,360
aren't you worried that other restaurants will learn it?

241
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:36,120
Even if they learn the secrets

242
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:38,409
and the methods, so what?

243
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:41,070
They can't make it well either

244
00:08:41,710 --> 00:08:42,659
if they don't enjoy the same understanding and skills of Chef Zheng.

245
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:43,880
Dear friends,

246
00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:46,880
this is the absolute confidence of a high grade restaurant.

247
00:08:47,890 --> 00:08:48,240
Okay.

248
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:49,380
Let's not disturb him.

249
00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:51,160
Let's continue to have a look at Professor Yang's test.

250
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:53,680
Is that okay?

251
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:55,350
Don't worry.

252
00:08:56,650 --> 00:08:58,020
Don't force yourself if it doesn't work.

253
00:08:58,490 --> 00:08:59,460
Don't worry. I'm fine.

254
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:11,620
Can you guarantee the quality?

255
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:13,510
It was just an illusion.

256
00:09:14,290 --> 00:09:14,890
Who said that?

257
00:09:15,610 --> 00:09:16,320
That's right.

258
00:09:16,450 --> 00:09:18,850
They're putting on a show this time.

259
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,780
They can't be so professional

260
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:22,280
during their real operation.

261
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:24,730
The kitchen is so clean.

262
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:29,520
Don't be fooled by this illusion.

263
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:31,020
Many restaurants can't meet such a standard.

264
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:32,580
It's impossible for them

265
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:33,580
to keep it when running.

266
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:42,340
It all fits the rules.

267
00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:42,880
Yes.

268
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:44,170
There's no problem during the production.

269
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,530
Why would such news broke before?

270
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:14,380
Our dish

271
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:16,140
is being cooked now.

272
00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:17,640
Among the media who is present,

273
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:19,760
two of you can have a chance to taste

274
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:21,620
the signature dish of Restaurant Si,

275
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:22,770
Lamb Chop with Lobsters.

276
00:10:23,570 --> 00:10:24,640
You each

277
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:26,380
have a number of your own.

278
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:28,790
Now we will draw two numbers,

279
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:30,910
whose holders will be our lucky tasters.

280
00:10:36,130 --> 00:10:36,660
Number five.

281
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:49,580
Who do you think is the next one?

282
00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:51,880
Number six.

283
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:52,670
Here.

284
00:10:53,370 --> 00:10:53,780
Okay.

285
00:10:54,910 --> 00:10:56,670
We have two lucky tasters now.

286
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:57,270
Then,

287
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:59,470
please sit at our table

288
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:00,870
and taste the dish.

289
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:05,980
Now,

290
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:07,610
Professor Yang's test result

291
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:09,660
has been shown to everyone.

292
00:11:10,850 --> 00:11:11,780
Let's welcome Professor Yang

293
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,780
to explain the test result.

294
00:11:14,210 --> 00:11:15,030
Professor Yang, please.

295
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:17,460
The test result today is

296
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:19,310
that the kitchen has no hygiene problem.

297
00:11:20,190 --> 00:11:22,530
But there is indeed something wrong with the ingredients.

298
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:25,510
There are two lamb chops today.

299
00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:27,430
One of them has a problem.

300
00:11:28,430 --> 00:11:30,830
How about asking Mr. Fang

301
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:32,130
to introduce these two lamb chops?

302
00:11:35,090 --> 00:11:36,070
Everyone,

303
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,710
for the two ingredients today,

304
00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:40,370
one is from our usual supplier,

305
00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:41,170
Weijia Group.

306
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:42,900
And the other one

307
00:11:43,090 --> 00:11:45,080
is from an unknown supplier.

308
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,490
Let's ask Professor Yang

309
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:49,500
to answer

310
00:11:49,770 --> 00:11:51,870
which lamb chop got the problem.

311
00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:53,110
Professor Yang, please.

312
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:54,870
Something is wrong with Weijia's chop.

313
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:56,960
Who is the owner of Weijia?

314
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:58,190
We should expose

315
00:11:58,220 --> 00:11:59,020
this delinquent supplier

316
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:00,110
and find the owner behind it.

317
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:03,300
The test report of Restaurant Si

318
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:04,060
has come out.

319
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,550
The truth has been revealed.

320
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:06,440
Wait.

321
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:09,330
Who can prove that this sample lamb chop

322
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:11,560
must be provided by Weijia Group?

323
00:12:12,890 --> 00:12:13,730
The deliveryman is here.

324
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,390
Excuse me, buddy,

325
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,650
did you deliver today's package?

326
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:21,660
Yes.

327
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:24,580
Are you sure the number is 912?

328
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:25,670
This one?

329
00:12:26,190 --> 00:12:26,700
Yes.

330
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:28,370
Okay, thank you.

331
00:12:37,010 --> 00:12:39,550
Now that the truth has come to light,

332
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:40,360
Rest assured.

333
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,800
We've also prepared

334
00:12:42,950 --> 00:12:44,990
Lamb Chops with Lobsters without problems

335
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:46,510
for the media and audience present

336
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:47,500
to have a try.

337
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:48,260
Thank you.

338
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:15,380
I am sorry.

339
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:16,420
I'm late.

340
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:19,480
I'm exhausted from running.

341
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,300
What took you so long?

342
00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:22,470
Really.

343
00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:23,120
Let me tell you.

344
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:24,600
It's too hard to ask for leave.

345
00:13:24,810 --> 00:13:25,580
I have no choice.

346
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:26,810
Put it over there.

347
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:35,380
Son.

348
00:13:38,210 --> 00:13:38,830
Come home with me.

349
00:13:41,970 --> 00:13:43,180
Who is your son?

350
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,100
Yu Sicheng.

351
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:47,630
Didn't you hear me?

352
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:55,850
What on earth do you want?

353
00:13:56,190 --> 00:13:57,100
What else do I want?

354
00:13:57,850 --> 00:13:58,780
I'm here to take you home.

355
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:01,470
Who is this old man?

356
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,740
This is Mr. Yu Sheng from Shengshi Group.

357
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:06,280
The shop across the street

358
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:08,050
is Shengshi Group's property.

359
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:13,500
Director Zheng.

360
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:15,100
We meet again, my old friend.

361
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:17,630
What fate.

362
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:19,000
We just met once.

363
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:20,360
It's not friends.

364
00:14:25,650 --> 00:14:26,190
Sicheng.

365
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:27,440
Come home with me.

366
00:14:28,030 --> 00:14:29,690
This is not what you should do.

367
00:14:39,210 --> 00:14:39,660
Don't touch me.

368
00:14:41,690 --> 00:14:42,360
I'm not going back.

369
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:51,190
I'm leaving.

370
00:14:59,480 --> 00:14:59,890
Sicheng.

371
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:02,260
Do you have anything to say?

372
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:06,060
I didn't mean it.

373
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:07,550
What do you mean?

374
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:10,270
The issue of Si has something to do with you?

375
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:10,940
Absolutely not.

376
00:15:12,610 --> 00:15:13,050
But

377
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:15,630
Weijia's legal person

378
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,130
is a distant relative of mine.

379
00:15:20,350 --> 00:15:21,260
So your dad

380
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:24,810
collaborated with Weijia’s exclusive cold chain

381
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:26,740
to supply unqualified ingredients to Si?

382
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:27,580
Yes and no.

383
00:15:28,650 --> 00:15:30,540
Weijia’s legal person is just a cover.

384
00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:32,370
Yu Sheng

385
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:35,570
has the final say.

386
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:37,150
So he didn't collude with

387
00:15:37,290 --> 00:15:38,190
but appoint them directly.

388
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:40,880
It seems that

389
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:42,320
it's the thing.

390
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:45,830
As for the reason,

391
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:47,570
like his secretary said,

392
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:48,950
Si is their rival.

393
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,000
It seems

394
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,160
he did that

395
00:15:54,010 --> 00:15:54,730
in order to defeat Si.

396
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:57,420
So you just watched

397
00:15:57,450 --> 00:15:58,380
your dad to set a trap to Si?

398
00:15:58,820 --> 00:15:59,910
How are you so brazen to help us here?

399
00:15:59,930 --> 00:16:00,890
Shame on you!

400
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:01,910
How dare you!

401
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:05,330
Zhuang Yan.

402
00:16:08,850 --> 00:16:09,460
Yu Sicheng.

403
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:11,310
How did you know Yu Sheng's plan?

404
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:15,520
I...

405
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:20,730
I've been busy with you these days.

406
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:22,140
I knew a lot of information.

407
00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:23,590
I saw Weijia today

408
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:25,660
and Yu Sheng,

409
00:16:26,810 --> 00:16:27,980
then I realized what happened.

410
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:29,360
So you didn't know in advance?

411
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,370
You just found it out today?

412
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:31,090
Of course.

413
00:16:31,770 --> 00:16:32,370
If I had known,

414
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:33,480
I would have told you in advance.

415
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:34,860
I just found out today

416
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,880
that Si's supplier is Weijia.

417
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:45,210
Okay.

418
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:48,450
We believe you didn't lie to us.

419
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:50,160
The problem of Si has been solved.

420
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:51,410
Let's move on.

421
00:16:53,270 --> 00:16:56,430
But for the matter between you and Zhuang Yan,

422
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:58,750
and the fact that you hid your identity from her,

423
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:00,880
you have to solve it by yourself.

424
00:17:07,099 --> 00:17:08,380
What are you waiting for?

425
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:10,230
She's gone.

426
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:10,740
Go after her!

427
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:12,750
Go now.

428
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:18,660
Zhuang Yan.

429
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,119
Zhuang Yan, calm down.

430
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:24,030
Listen to me.

431
00:17:24,369 --> 00:17:26,200
I witnessed everything with you today.

432
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:28,040
I only found out when I saw Yu.

433
00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:29,080
I swear.

434
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:30,660
I really didn't know

435
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:33,330
the supplier of Si is Weijia.

436
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:34,870
Yu Sicheng.

437
00:17:35,570 --> 00:17:36,240
You have seen

438
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:38,790
how much effort everyone has made for Si.

439
00:17:39,650 --> 00:17:41,550
In the end, your family is the one behind it.

440
00:17:41,790 --> 00:17:43,350
You really didn't know?

441
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:44,140
Zhuang Yan.

442
00:17:44,170 --> 00:17:45,470
How can I make you believe me?

443
00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:46,820
I-I really...

444
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:47,270
Fine.

445
00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:49,280
I'll take it as you didn't know.

446
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:51,770
But why didn't you tell me he is your father?

447
00:17:55,610 --> 00:17:56,260
I think

448
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:58,490
he and I are different individuals.

449
00:17:58,890 --> 00:17:59,700
I am the one who's dating with you.

450
00:17:59,730 --> 00:18:00,800
Not him.

451
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:05,070
I don't know why you care about this.

452
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:10,390
So you think you don't need to tell me this.

453
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:12,680
You mean I thought too much.

454
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:14,940
All right. All right.

455
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:16,460
I was wrong.

456
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:17,930
I apologize.

457
00:18:18,670 --> 00:18:20,350
It's my fault for hiding my dad's identity.

458
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:21,580
I'm sorry.

459
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:23,950
Don't be angry, okay?

460
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:24,930
Yu Sicheng,

461
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:27,050
can you not talk

462
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:28,240
like a child?

463
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:29,340
Do you think

464
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:31,220
it's as simple as it seems?

465
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:36,150
It's not your bad.

466
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:38,890
From the beginning,

467
00:18:38,890 --> 00:18:40,300
we are not from the same world.

468
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:42,770
What do you mean?

469
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:49,300
Let's reconsider

470
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:50,520
our relationship.

471
00:19:03,730 --> 00:19:04,260
Zhuang Yan!

472
00:19:21,370 --> 00:19:21,730
Mentor.

473
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:23,450
This is my plan for the next few days.

474
00:19:23,450 --> 00:19:23,990
I see.

475
00:19:24,290 --> 00:19:24,700
Leave it there.

476
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:01,060
Yu is pitiful indeed.

477
00:20:11,090 --> 00:20:11,670
Sicheng.

478
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:14,650
You treated me to milk tea for many times.

479
00:20:14,830 --> 00:20:15,850
Let me treat you this time.

480
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:19,340
It was for everyone.

481
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:20,530
You're welcome.

482
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:24,740
Then, I'll put it here.

483
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:26,410
Remember to drink it.

484
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:35,160
What's wrong?

485
00:20:37,990 --> 00:20:39,110
I'm not feeling well.

486
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:41,050
Watching Sicheng feeling sad,

487
00:20:41,290 --> 00:20:42,400
I feel sad too.

488
00:20:47,210 --> 00:20:47,760
Tong.

489
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:50,900
You know what you should do.

490
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:52,320
What should I do?

491
00:20:59,870 --> 00:21:00,330
He

492
00:21:01,290 --> 00:21:02,500
is just a young master

493
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:04,000
who is careless.

494
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:06,430
It's rare for him to be upset.

495
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:09,670
Let him experience life.

496
00:21:11,330 --> 00:21:12,320
I mean

497
00:21:13,010 --> 00:21:14,310
time proves everything.

498
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:48,890
Xu Duo.

499
00:21:51,130 --> 00:21:51,550
Xu Duo.

500
00:21:55,530 --> 00:21:56,660
Good job, Zheng Dao.

501
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:01,590
Here.

502
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:06,790
I entrust my daughter to you.

503
00:22:07,210 --> 00:22:07,900
Take good care of her.

504
00:22:09,010 --> 00:22:09,340
Wait.

505
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:15,920
We will watch a movie later.

506
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:17,240
Don't come over.

507
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:18,800
Take it.

508
00:22:20,290 --> 00:22:20,720
Go.

509
00:22:42,090 --> 00:22:43,780
Don't forget to buy us a meal to celebrate your relationship.

510
00:22:45,870 --> 00:22:46,260
Sure.

511
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:50,500
Director Zheng said "sure".

512
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,580
When will it be?

513
00:23:00,310 --> 00:23:01,360
It's better to do it soon.

514
00:23:01,570 --> 00:23:02,170
Tonight is the deal.

515
00:23:03,390 --> 00:23:04,700
Tonight is the deal. You hear me?

516
00:23:07,730 --> 00:23:08,120
Go on.

517
00:23:08,610 --> 00:23:08,970
Okay.

518
00:23:16,050 --> 00:23:16,640
Mr. Fan Jian,

519
00:23:16,990 --> 00:23:17,900
this is your wine today.

520
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:20,620
Director Zheng.

521
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:21,990
You're so generous.

522
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:23,100
So lavish.

523
00:23:25,210 --> 00:23:27,230
On this beautiful day with summer night breeze,

524
00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:28,040
let us enjoy the red wine.

525
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:29,520
Very romantic.

526
00:23:30,350 --> 00:23:31,740
Stop being a henchman.

527
00:23:32,770 --> 00:23:33,520
Stop talking.

528
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:36,210
The one who pays has a say.

529
00:23:37,010 --> 00:23:37,480
Besides,

530
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:39,020
when I praise him,

531
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:40,970
I bet you are elated inside.

532
00:23:43,790 --> 00:23:45,000
I'm delightful for real.

533
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:46,860
All right.

534
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:48,140
Director Zheng,

535
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:50,080
are you ready to accept my interview?

536
00:23:51,330 --> 00:23:52,750
What kind of interview is that?

537
00:23:52,870 --> 00:23:54,150
It's more like torture.

538
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:55,110
What?

539
00:23:55,870 --> 00:23:57,890
How dare I torture Director Zheng?

540
00:23:59,650 --> 00:24:00,280
I'm ready.

541
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:00,860
Go ahead.

542
00:24:01,330 --> 00:24:01,880
The first question.

543
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:03,300
Mr. Zheng Dao.

544
00:24:03,830 --> 00:24:04,720
When did you start to

545
00:24:05,170 --> 00:24:07,000
have feelings for Shen Ying?

546
00:24:09,910 --> 00:24:11,320
It's hard to answer.

547
00:24:12,290 --> 00:24:14,380
But I feel that our relationship

548
00:24:14,950 --> 00:24:16,280
is like destiny.

549
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:24,520
If I have to say,

550
00:24:25,330 --> 00:24:27,300
I think it was the first time I saw you.

551
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:28,900
When we first met,

552
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:30,690
I don't think I left you a good impression.

553
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:31,520
Who are you?

554
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:32,130
She's mine.

555
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:32,840
Get out of my way!

556
00:24:37,610 --> 00:24:38,710
Wong Fei-hung!

557
00:24:44,050 --> 00:24:44,490
Enough!

558
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:45,930
I'm sorry

559
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:48,790
to have let you come with blessings...

560
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:50,430
I sincerely hope that

561
00:24:52,890 --> 00:24:54,440
the next wedding you attend

562
00:24:56,630 --> 00:24:59,450
will be full of love and happiness.

563
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:04,540
Are you sure?

564
00:25:05,730 --> 00:25:06,200
Yes.

565
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:08,830
What's the doubt?

566
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:10,460
It's just love at first sight.

567
00:25:11,370 --> 00:25:11,980
Next question.

568
00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:14,440
When did you decide

569
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:16,220
to date Shen Ying?

570
00:25:20,530 --> 00:25:21,700
When I first saw

571
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,410
the videos in her camera.

572
00:25:25,510 --> 00:25:27,420
Drink with me.

573
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:29,260
Fly.

574
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:30,530
I won't tell anyone.

575
00:25:32,370 --> 00:25:33,490
What are you talking about?

576
00:25:33,570 --> 00:25:34,260
You haven't deleted it, have you?

577
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:36,980
Alright.

578
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:37,810
Next question.

579
00:25:39,330 --> 00:25:42,140
How many girlfriends have you had?

580
00:25:43,610 --> 00:25:45,090
Don't ask this question.

581
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:45,680
Next.

582
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:48,580
It's okay.

583
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:49,850
I dated one before.

584
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:54,110
Why did you break up?

585
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:58,440
I don't think it's polite to talk about the ex.

586
00:26:00,990 --> 00:26:01,900
Respect your ex.

587
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:03,160
Good.

588
00:26:03,950 --> 00:26:04,390
Zhuang.

589
00:26:04,890 --> 00:26:05,790
Do you have any questions?

590
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:07,390
No.

591
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:09,680
Congratulations, Director Zheng.

592
00:26:10,050 --> 00:26:11,450
You passed our review.

593
00:26:12,610 --> 00:26:14,260
Please send me the date and the time when you were born.

594
00:26:14,950 --> 00:26:16,500
I'll learn about your fortune as soon as possible.

595
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:18,020
Great.

596
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:19,700
I'll send them to you tonight.

597
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:20,780
Okay.

598
00:26:21,810 --> 00:26:23,230
Now,

599
00:26:24,030 --> 00:26:26,690
Congratulations to ShenZhangZhengYi couple.

600
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:28,470
Wish them a harmonious marriage.

601
00:26:29,090 --> 00:26:30,020
I'll keep working hard.

602
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:31,200
Cheers!

603
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:31,770
Cheers.

604
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:35,100
Right,

605
00:26:35,270 --> 00:26:36,240
we have

606
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:38,480
a piece of good news to you.

607
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:40,530
Could it be that...

608
00:26:42,210 --> 00:26:43,960
We asked for leave from the company.

609
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:45,360
We're going to use up leave

610
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:46,500
for this year.

611
00:26:46,890 --> 00:26:47,500
You scared me.

612
00:26:47,610 --> 00:26:49,240
I thought I am going to be a great-uncle.

613
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,380
You should run your words together.

614
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:53,160
None of your business.

615
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:54,180
Cheers.

616
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,800
Vacations, here we come.

617
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:07,170
Zheng Dao.

618
00:27:08,730 --> 00:27:09,260
Xu Duo.

619
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:10,960
Are you here to monitor me?

620
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:11,930
What do you want?

621
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:15,020
I'm here to borrow the bottle opener.

622
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:19,670
Good buddy.

623
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:20,100
Take it.

624
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:21,180
Leave now.

625
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:21,750
Bye. Bye.

626
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:22,180
I...

627
00:27:25,230 --> 00:27:25,760
I am sorry.

628
00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:26,810
[Application Files for Studying Abroad]

629
00:27:29,420 --> 00:27:30,380
Why are you peeking again?

630
00:27:30,730 --> 00:27:31,870
I left all my annual leave to you.

631
00:27:32,070 --> 00:27:32,700
Haven't you seen me enough?

632
00:27:32,830 --> 00:27:34,470
I'm not peeking.

633
00:27:34,910 --> 00:27:36,050
I'm looking at you fairly and squarely.

634
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:41,130
Can I ask for a fair and square kiss?

635
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:53,760
Why didn't Xu Duo come to pick me up in person today?

636
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:55,900
He's working overtime today.

637
00:27:56,630 --> 00:27:57,820
We pick you up for him.

638
00:27:57,980 --> 00:27:58,460
What do you think?

639
00:27:58,460 --> 00:27:59,260
Are you satisfied, Bai?

640
00:28:00,490 --> 00:28:00,980
No.

641
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:03,140
What should we do

642
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:04,340
to satisfy Bai?

643
00:28:04,990 --> 00:28:06,070
Get married soon.

644
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:07,420
Before I go abroad.

645
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:10,470
I promise you.

646
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:24,430
You are here.

647
00:28:24,830 --> 00:28:25,540
Dr Zhang is waiting for you.

648
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:26,190
Go in now.

649
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:28,720
Cooperate with the doctor.

650
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:32,610
I'm going to the clinic.

651
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:34,340
I'll ask the receptionist to get you some water later.

652
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:35,010
Okay.

653
00:28:35,250 --> 00:28:35,690
See you later.

654
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:36,740
Have a seat.

655
00:28:47,210 --> 00:28:49,720
Do you think Li Bai will be cured?

656
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:51,140
Why not?

657
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:52,980
You can cook now.

658
00:28:58,960 --> 00:28:59,650
You know what?

659
00:29:00,590 --> 00:29:02,020
When I took an optional course,

660
00:29:02,050 --> 00:29:02,980
I once read

661
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:05,780
Freud thought

662
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:10,070
the boundary between the normal and the abnormal

663
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:11,350
was evident.

664
00:29:13,190 --> 00:29:14,040
He firmly believed

665
00:29:14,070 --> 00:29:15,790
he was a normal and healthy person.

666
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:18,990
But as time went by,

667
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:21,180
he realized

668
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:25,940
that the abnormal and unhealthy people

669
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:28,460
were the majority.

670
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:37,360
Thank you.

671
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:43,020
Bai.

672
00:29:43,430 --> 00:29:45,400
Love in your mind mirrors love in my mind and vice versa.

673
00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:47,960
You in my mind are worthy of love.

674
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:50,370
And I in your mind am also worthy of love.

675
00:29:50,930 --> 00:29:52,100
More importantly,

676
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:53,460
to get your love,

677
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:54,830
I have to love you first.

678
00:29:55,510 --> 00:29:57,060
Some love should be said earlier.

679
00:29:57,300 --> 00:29:58,470
It'll be more regretful if you miss telling it.

680
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,490
Don't keep things to yourself.

681
00:30:01,610 --> 00:30:02,450
Now,

682
00:30:03,010 --> 00:30:05,500
you can bravely try what you want to do.

683
00:30:19,010 --> 00:30:20,050
Hey, what's wrong?

684
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:23,710
I can't find my application files.

685
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:25,560
Can you help me find them?

686
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:26,670
Sure. Where are they?
