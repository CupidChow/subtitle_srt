00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:34,610
[Episode 9]

3
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,360
How much whipped cream did you use?

4
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:40,580
Two point three liters.

5
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:41,950
Then it may run out.

6
00:01:42,289 --> 00:01:43,620
The food team only prepared three liters of the cream,

7
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:45,030
which is enough for you to shoot 20 times.

8
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:47,100
How about this?

9
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:47,890
I'll go buy it now.

10
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:49,350
Shen Ying.

11
00:01:59,259 --> 00:02:00,930
The cream was prepared by me beforehand,

12
00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:01,540
which is hard to buy.

13
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:02,870
And it's so far from shops.

14
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:03,940
It'll be dark when you come back.

15
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:05,680
Alright.

16
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:07,410
Is there any

17
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:08,419
substitute?

18
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:10,580
Just now...

19
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:12,360
I just saw the whipping cream of the same brand.

20
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:14,670
I managed to use whipping cream to make foam before.

21
00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:15,500
We can have a try.

22
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:16,640
No.

23
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:19,829
The foam made by whipping cream is easily bursted.

24
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:20,880
It's not good for the shooting.

25
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:26,510
I see there’s a lot of whipping cream left.

26
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:27,300
I can keep generating the cream

27
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:27,990
and renewing the props.

28
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:28,870
But the point is

29
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:30,870
if the taste changes,

30
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,700
we will need change the ingredients into whipped cream when the dessert goes public.

31
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:36,240
What are you going to do?

32
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:38,470
Change the dessert into one

33
00:02:38,579 --> 00:02:39,700
-that only needs whipping cream. -that only needs whipping cream.

34
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:46,690
Point taken.

35
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,380
This time, the Odd Dessert of Bitter Gourds is very eye-catching.

36
00:02:58,010 --> 00:02:59,680
And Guan Guan's popularity

37
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:01,850
boosted Thirty Degrees South Latitude's data, which left others in the dust.

38
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:04,090
Its sales have reached the first place in the city,

39
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:06,100
much more ahead than the second place.

40
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:09,860
Everyone did a good job.

41
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,130
Next,

42
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:12,450
let's keep working hard

43
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:14,890
and deepening our cooperation with Shengshi Group.

44
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:18,230
Miranda, I have a question.

45
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:19,130
Go ahead.

46
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:20,870
This time, one of Thirty Degrees South Latitude's branches

47
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:22,050
used shoddy ingredients.

48
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:24,510
They replaced ordinary cream nearing its expiration date

49
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:26,340
with the whipped cream we originally planned.

50
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,520
This is not as good as the cream you ordered.

51
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:30,410
But it won't be too bad.

52
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:33,700
The cream will expire today.

53
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:37,820
Theoretically, it hasn't yet.

54
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:39,579
It will expire after 23:59

55
00:03:39,579 --> 00:03:40,220
tonight.

56
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:41,810
The cream nearing its expiration date

57
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,320
means it's not expired yet.

58
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:45,270
Is there any food safety issues?

59
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:46,880
True, there isn't.

60
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:49,250
But if Zheng Dao, Shen Ying, and I

61
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,140
didn't ask for it,

62
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:52,090
they wouldn't change back to the original ingredients.

63
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:52,780
Here's the thing.

64
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:54,260
You have made our Odd Dessert of Bitter Gourds

65
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,190
famous now.

66
00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:56,570
Besides,

67
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:58,050
the ordinary cream

68
00:03:58,260 --> 00:03:59,740
has passed the safety test.

69
00:04:00,050 --> 00:04:00,920
So I think

70
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:02,320
it's okay if we use this.

71
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:03,910
Manager,

72
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:04,860
when we make delicacies,

73
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,090
we should always strive for the best.

74
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:07,620
If you use "it's okay"

75
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:08,780
to cover up

76
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:09,860
the shoddy ingredients this time,

77
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:11,420
how can we make good food like this?

78
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:12,620
Ms. Shen,

79
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,340
I'm the manager of this branch.

80
00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:15,930
The profit of this shop

81
00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:17,500
is the manager's priority.

82
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:18,750
Manager,

83
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:21,820
is the new dessert plan I gave you

84
00:04:21,899 --> 00:04:23,540
not enough for you to cover the cost?

85
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:28,760
Manager,

86
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:31,300
if you insist on doing this,

87
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:32,580
I'll expose you in the industry

88
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:34,110
and make you disappear from the top.

89
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:36,550
I won't stop you from ruining Thirty Degrees South Latitude.

90
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:37,950
But I won't let you go

91
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:39,420
if you mar the image of Isen.

92
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:42,180
We did succeed this time,

93
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:44,190
but who can supervise

94
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:45,070
the quality of the production afterward?

95
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:47,130
Let Thirty Degrees South Latitude take control of it themselves.

96
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,120
After all, we are service provider.

97
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:51,320
We have to work for our clients.

98
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:53,909
As long as nothing serious happens, it's okay.

99
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:54,770
Absolutely not.

100
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:56,530
We can't damage our reputation.

101
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:57,940
Even if we are service provider,

102
00:04:58,350 --> 00:04:59,430
we must urge our clients

103
00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:01,160
to fulfill their promises to consumers.

104
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:01,950
After all,

105
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:03,600
we are the largest food media in China.

106
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,290
I agree with Director Zheng.

107
00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:16,430
Coming.

108
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:17,980
Thank you.

109
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:18,740
You're welcome.

110
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:20,650
Is it fine to talk to Miranda like this today?

111
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,560
But if I didn't say that,

112
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:26,150
with these ingredients in my hands,

113
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:27,260
I couldn't persuade myself.

114
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:29,730
It's okay.

115
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:31,370
The person next to you is always like that,

116
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:32,409
and he's fine as well.

117
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:39,140
Now that I know Mr. Fan,

118
00:05:39,890 --> 00:05:41,640
how about I treat you a meal there

119
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:43,370
after work?

120
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:44,050
What do you think?

121
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:44,920
Great.

122
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:46,110
Thank you.

123
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:47,310
I'll wait for you downstairs.

124
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:47,800
Okay.

125
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,060
Don't bother.

126
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:50,920
Shen Ying is used to taking my car, right?

127
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:03,220
Hello?

128
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:06,140
Okay, I'll be right there.

129
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:11,060
Zhiqiu,

130
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:12,440
you can go now if you are busy.

131
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:13,540
As for Shen Ying,

132
00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:14,810
I'll take her there.

133
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:15,520
See you later.

134
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:21,830
See you later.

135
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:26,070
Bye.

136
00:06:26,890 --> 00:06:27,260
Bye.

137
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:40,550
Mr. Yu.

138
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,960
About the cooperation project with Isen,

139
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,760
the store manager called.

140
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:48,260
He said he was under great pressure due to the cost.

141
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,200
Isen seeks for delicacies passionately.

142
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:52,580
But I make desserts commercially.

143
00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:55,740
But the relationship between Isen and Ye Zhiqiu...

144
00:06:58,850 --> 00:07:01,690
Let them mind their own business.

145
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:02,660
Note that.

146
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:03,440
This restaurant is really good.

147
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:04,670
[A food safety problem was found in Thirty Degrees South Latitude.]

148
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:05,310
We came to the scene immediately

149
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:06,640
to interview those who are involved.

150
00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:07,740
Unfortunately,

151
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:08,680
no one is in charge.

152
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:09,940
I've received the email.

153
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:11,330
That's all for now.

154
00:07:12,810 --> 00:07:13,250
Miranda,

155
00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:15,760
can you give me a reasonable explanation?

156
00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:16,500
Have a seat.

157
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:21,190
What we care about more

158
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:22,770
is the current reputation.

159
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:25,100
The company's top priority isn't to put the blame

160
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:25,830
but to correct the mistake.

161
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:28,680
Deleting bad comments and leaving good ones massively by the PR department

162
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,240
is the softest way

163
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:32,320
we can do it now.

164
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:33,960
Now,

165
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:35,930
I just let the derailed train

166
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,659
back to its original track.

167
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:39,500
I don't care about your so-called track.

168
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:41,350
In the dessert industry,

169
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:42,340
if we

170
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:43,580
can't even stick to

171
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:44,540
the basic industry bottom line,

172
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:46,659
there's no way for Thirty Degrees South Latitude

173
00:07:46,659 --> 00:07:48,100
to enjoy a brighter future.

174
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:48,770
Zhiqiu,

175
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,860
you need to think before you speak.

176
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,860
I think I need to reconsider

177
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:55,130
the collaboration with Thirty Degrees South Latitude.

178
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:56,580
Zhiqiu,

179
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:00,730
our cooperation has just begun.

180
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:03,180
I think I am obligated to remind you

181
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,020
to uphold the spirit of the contract.

182
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:12,510
People who differ in their principles do not work together.

183
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:14,770
Goodbye.

184
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:50,710
Chief Editor Lin.

185
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:52,520
It's been a long time.

186
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:53,460
Mr. Yu,

187
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:54,720
I'll cut to the chase.

188
00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:56,590
The Odd Dessert of Bitter Gourds project we've worked on together

189
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:57,660
is questioned about the freshness.

190
00:08:58,340 --> 00:08:59,600
Did your people tamper with it?

191
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:01,180
My partner,

192
00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:03,420
I don't like what you said.

193
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:05,650
Will I harm your benefits?

194
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:07,350
What you've done

195
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,000
is extremely bad for our magazine's reputation.

196
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:10,350
You have to take the responsibility.

197
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:11,720
As a businessman,

198
00:09:12,090 --> 00:09:14,320
the most essential thing is to maximize the benefits.

199
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:17,630
I don't think you don't understand that.

200
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:19,430
Oh, yes.

201
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:21,810
If Isen

202
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:23,920
can't even handle this,

203
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,450
we may have to

204
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:29,240
reconsider our cooperation.

205
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:32,550
After all, it's not good if one side drags the other side down.

206
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:34,990
I'll think about it.

207
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:36,410
Okay.

208
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:43,480
For the incident of Odd Dessert of Bitter Gourds,

209
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,480
we must offer a solution.

210
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:48,110
I have already arranged the solutions

211
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:49,280
to the risk control and public relations.

212
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:52,120
I'm doing it from the company's perspective

213
00:09:52,770 --> 00:09:54,940
to avoid our reputation being ruined as much as we can.

214
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:57,440
But now,

215
00:09:57,580 --> 00:09:59,090
about Ye Zhiqiu's termination

216
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:01,470
and Thirty Degrees South Latitude's investment withdrawal,

217
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:03,020
we must give an explanation.

218
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:06,780
Someone from Isen needs to stand out

219
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:08,190
to take the blame.

220
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:10,540
Yes.

221
00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:12,090
What?

222
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:13,950
Do you want Zheng...

223
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:16,770
Want Director to take the blame?

224
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:18,060
-He didn't do anything wrong. -Shen Ying.

225
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:19,600
But...

226
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:20,450
The decision I made

227
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:21,750
is to protect Isen.

228
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:23,660
Think it before you speak.

229
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:25,390
Shen Ying.

230
00:10:29,770 --> 00:10:30,690
I only have one problem.

231
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,260
It's about the cream.

232
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:34,790
Looks like Director Zheng has investigated it in private.

233
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:37,100
If I give you a solution

234
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:38,340
within three days,

235
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:40,130
can we turn to the next page?

236
00:10:41,090 --> 00:10:42,000
What if you can't solve it?

237
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:42,970
I'll leave Isen.

238
00:10:48,170 --> 00:10:49,050
You make it serious, Director Zheng.

239
00:10:49,490 --> 00:10:50,450
I look forward to your good news.

240
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,340
Thank you for sending me home.

241
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:11,630
I'll go home now.

242
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:14,750
What's wrong?

243
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:16,670
I want to say

244
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,150
you don’t have to dwell on it.

245
00:11:19,090 --> 00:11:20,710
I'm confident about

246
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:21,650
what I told Miranda this afternoon.

247
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:24,410
But I'm still a little worried.

248
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:25,950
Well,

249
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:27,290
are you worried about me

250
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,090
or him?

251
00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:34,500
One of you is my best friend,

252
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:39,040
and the other is my...

253
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,630
Of course I'm worried about you both.

254
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,330
Don't worry.

255
00:11:47,330 --> 00:11:48,140
I know what to do.

256
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,270
Have you found a countermeasure?

257
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:51,610
I got one.

258
00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:53,290
And I've discussed it with Ye Zhiqiu this afternoon.

259
00:11:53,950 --> 00:11:54,510
Don’t worry.

260
00:11:54,850 --> 00:11:56,020
I knew it.

261
00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:58,120
I was worried the whole afternoon for nothing.

262
00:11:59,210 --> 00:12:00,690
So what's your solution?

263
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:02,170
The high cost of cream

264
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,930
is firstly due to the direct cost of the ingredients,

265
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:05,860
and secondly because of the indirect cost of transportation and so on.

266
00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:07,580
If it's about the cost,

267
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:08,290
it is easy to solve.

268
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:10,150
Please tell me.

269
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:13,900
I’ve contacted the suppliers in India.

270
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:15,520
Ye Zhiqiu has gone to check it.

271
00:12:16,010 --> 00:12:18,190
The goods from other suppliers will arrive tonight.

272
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:19,560
It's you indeed.

273
00:12:19,810 --> 00:12:20,470
Fabulous!

274
00:12:22,490 --> 00:12:23,370
So don't worry.

275
00:12:23,770 --> 00:12:24,150
Go home.

276
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:25,020
Okay.

277
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:27,190
I hope everything goes well.

278
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:30,150
I'm leaving.

279
00:12:30,210 --> 00:12:30,630
Okay.

280
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:41,500
Bye.

281
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,170
Why are you so silly?

282
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:55,100
Why are you still as the same as when you were a kid?

283
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:56,020
What?

284
00:12:57,140 --> 00:12:57,900
Morning, Director.

285
00:12:58,460 --> 00:12:59,210
What's your face

286
00:12:59,210 --> 00:13:00,540
so gloomy in the morning?

287
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:03,240
It sets off his white teeth.

288
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,590
Indeed.

289
00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:07,120
Why did you two arrive here together?

290
00:13:08,410 --> 00:13:09,530
When I was young,

291
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:10,740
I went to school with Shen Ying every day.

292
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,110
And now, I go to work with her.

293
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:14,750
It's not against your staff rules, right?

294
00:13:16,070 --> 00:13:17,600
Alright, stop showing off.

295
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:18,450
Let's go.

296
00:13:18,530 --> 00:13:19,700
I hope everything is going on well today.

297
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:20,430
Go.

298
00:13:20,650 --> 00:13:21,110
Let's go.

299
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:24,460
I've heard a lot about you, Mr. Yu.

300
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:25,100
Nice to meet you.

301
00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:26,080
Nice to meet you.

302
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:27,740
Hello.

303
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:29,130
Hello.

304
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:32,840
You are really young and promising.

305
00:13:33,050 --> 00:13:35,030
Once the Odd Dessert of Bitter Gourds was introduced,

306
00:13:35,450 --> 00:13:36,520
we won a great victory.

307
00:13:37,070 --> 00:13:39,220
Mr. Ye is indeed talented.

308
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:40,690
You deserve your fame.

309
00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:41,940
Mr. Yu, I'm flattered.

310
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:43,020
Let's

311
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:44,760
get to the point.

312
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:49,750
Young people really are pragmatic and straightforward.

313
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:51,270
Let's get started.

314
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:56,740
In fact, your company's biggest concern

315
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:57,590
is profit.

316
00:13:57,940 --> 00:13:59,120
This doesn't contradict

317
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:00,800
my worries.

318
00:14:01,690 --> 00:14:03,000
We have successfully built

319
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:04,000
the cream supply channel as we planned.

320
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:05,350
It can provide Thirty Degrees South Latitude with the cream.

321
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:07,260
The cost is one third of the original one.

322
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:22,190
Can you guarantee they are the same goods from the same places?

323
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:22,930
Sure.

324
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:25,180
What's the condition for the exchange?

325
00:14:25,710 --> 00:14:26,670
We need you to hold

326
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:29,570
a public dessert tasting that everyone can attend,

327
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:31,930
and invite all dessert bloggers and influencers.

328
00:14:32,450 --> 00:14:33,580
It will be led by Thirty Degrees South Latitude

329
00:14:33,770 --> 00:14:34,450
and reported by Isen,

330
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:35,990
in order to reverse the current reviews on us.

331
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,740
Isen boasts talents indeed.

332
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:57,320
Deal.

333
00:15:04,650 --> 00:15:05,660
Cheers.

334
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:11,380
Shen Ying made progress quickly.

335
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:12,920
All thanks to Director Zheng.

336
00:15:13,570 --> 00:15:14,000
Not at all.

337
00:15:14,530 --> 00:15:15,690
It's because Miranda taught her well.

338
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:16,990
After this tasting,

339
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:18,170
the reputation of  the Odd Dessert

340
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,330
has elevated to the next level.

341
00:15:19,570 --> 00:15:20,160
Yes.

342
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,310
I've seen many media praises.

343
00:15:22,590 --> 00:15:24,660
Mr. Zheng and Mr. Ye contributed a lot.

344
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:26,040
Of course,

345
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:27,540
the fact that Ying stood out bravely

346
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:28,370
is also very moving.

347
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:30,520
Our Ying

348
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:31,640
is still like her younger self

349
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:33,390
who couldn't stand watching Zhiqiu to be bullied.

350
00:15:34,090 --> 00:15:34,770
When she was a child?

351
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:36,750
Right.

352
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:38,620
They grew up together from a young age,

353
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:40,110
almost as early as when they were toddlers.

354
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:40,900
As long as...

355
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:42,500
Stop it. Stop it.

356
00:15:42,930 --> 00:15:44,050
Water under the bridge.

357
00:15:44,070 --> 00:15:44,670
Don't mention it.

358
00:15:45,130 --> 00:15:45,770
Yeah.

359
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:46,780
Let's drink.

360
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:47,770
Cheers.

361
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:53,540
We are all Isen's contributors.

362
00:15:53,690 --> 00:15:55,520
I didn't expect Shen Ying to be so capable now.

363
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:56,910
Look.

364
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:58,700
Let's all relax tonight.

365
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:00,050
I have other things to do.

366
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:00,870
I'll leave now.

367
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:05,060
Goodbye, Chief Editor.

368
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:05,530
Have fun.

369
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:06,230
Okay.

370
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:09,940
Here.

371
00:16:10,290 --> 00:16:11,320
Let's have another toast.

372
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:11,700
Okay.

373
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:13,310
Cheers.

374
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:24,730
Today,

375
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:26,190
the reason I called you here

376
00:16:26,370 --> 00:16:27,250
is simple.

377
00:16:27,650 --> 00:16:29,000
We're all gossip onlookers.

378
00:16:29,850 --> 00:16:30,730
As you all know,

379
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:32,810
Shen Ying

380
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:34,600
has recently attracted two men.

381
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:40,940
One is Mr. Zheng Dao, the macho director of our company.

382
00:16:41,290 --> 00:16:41,940
And the other

383
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:46,420
is the new considerate man, Mr. Ye Zhiqiu.

384
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:47,890
All of you here

385
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,040
are Shen Ying's best friends and colleagues.

386
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:50,890
So?

387
00:16:51,070 --> 00:16:52,630
As we try to keep the competion

388
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,280
fair and open,

389
00:16:54,570 --> 00:16:56,090
now, let's take sides.

390
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,000
Let's vote for

391
00:16:58,220 --> 00:16:59,910
the Shen Ying's boyfriend we like.

392
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:00,770
However,

393
00:17:01,210 --> 00:17:03,890
we need to explain the reasons for voting.

394
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:04,730
Okay?

395
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:05,420
Sure.

396
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:06,089
Okay.

397
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:09,390
Fan Jian,

398
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:11,050
are you bored?

399
00:17:11,390 --> 00:17:12,740
You take Ying as a bet?

400
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:14,010
What do you mean?

401
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:14,630
What I am doing

402
00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:17,380
is called respecting the popular opinion.

403
00:17:17,530 --> 00:17:18,020
You get it?

404
00:17:18,849 --> 00:17:19,550
Right.

405
00:17:20,290 --> 00:17:22,220
The masses have sharp eyes.

406
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:26,020
Alright.

407
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:27,650
Let's vote now.

408
00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:30,690
I am very angry

409
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:32,800
because these two handsome guys are not mine,

410
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:35,730
but Shen Ying treats me well.

411
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:37,220
I still have to

412
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:38,230
care about her marriage.

413
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:43,560
As a result, I vote for...

414
00:17:45,570 --> 00:17:48,320
Ye, Ye, Ye...

415
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:49,860
Director Zheng.

416
00:17:51,050 --> 00:17:51,680
Why?

417
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:52,750
The reason is that

418
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:55,360
a macho leader is the most tantalizing.

419
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:57,370
Although

420
00:17:57,390 --> 00:17:59,370
Shen Ying excels in her job,

421
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:02,130
there's always a more competent person than her.

422
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:03,810
If the strong ones go together,

423
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:06,000
they will definitely have a more competent baby.

424
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:08,890
According to your words,

425
00:18:09,070 --> 00:18:10,310
since both of them are aggressive,

426
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:11,590
their baby

427
00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:13,980
will live under two mountains since it is born.

428
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:15,070
Will it be able to survive?

429
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:16,170
I don't agree.

430
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:18,420
I think...

431
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:20,240
I vote for Ye.

432
00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:21,250
The reason?

433
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:22,660
It's simple.

434
00:18:23,130 --> 00:18:25,710
Ye and Shen Ying are childhood friends

435
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:26,850
who have a special bond.

436
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:28,960
And most importantly,

437
00:18:29,470 --> 00:18:31,220
Shen Ying has a bad temper.

438
00:18:31,290 --> 00:18:32,180
She just needs

439
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:34,030
this kind of good man who takes good care of her.

440
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:34,620
Right?

441
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:36,950
This is called "complementing each other".

442
00:18:37,430 --> 00:18:38,310
Only in this way can they live in peace.

443
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:38,860
Okay.

444
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:40,320
Now one to one.

445
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:42,110
Let's continue to vote.

446
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:43,130
-Bye. -Leaving, Ying.

447
00:18:57,680 --> 00:19:00,790
Ye.

448
00:19:00,810 --> 00:19:02,140
Ye. Ye. Ye.

449
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:02,620
OK.

450
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:05,660
Ye Zhiqiu is leading for now.

451
00:19:05,690 --> 00:19:07,700
Ye! Ye! Ye!

452
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:08,360
Right.

453
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:09,340
It's Ye Zhiqiu.

454
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:10,980
Ye.

455
00:19:11,050 --> 00:19:12,140
Ying, what brings you here?

456
00:19:12,450 --> 00:19:13,610
What are you doing?

457
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:17,100
Why did you put their photos

458
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:17,810
on it?

459
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:21,460
Take a guess.

460
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:26,520
Are you going to introduce marriage prospects to them?

461
00:19:27,130 --> 00:19:27,800
Ying.

462
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:29,700
You do have an odd mindset.

463
00:19:31,410 --> 00:19:32,110
Ying.

464
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:34,390
Have a seat.

465
00:19:36,130 --> 00:19:37,250
Let me ask you a question.

466
00:19:38,090 --> 00:19:39,430
If you were a woman...

467
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:40,810
No.

468
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:43,680
I mean if you are a woman...

469
00:19:47,550 --> 00:19:48,520
What are you trying to say?

470
00:19:49,490 --> 00:19:50,560
I just want to say

471
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:52,670
when this world is destroying

472
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:54,350
and only these two man will marry you,

473
00:19:54,410 --> 00:19:55,290
if you are asked to choose one,

474
00:19:55,370 --> 00:19:55,880
which one will you choose?

475
00:19:57,140 --> 00:19:57,960
Only two of them?

476
00:19:58,940 --> 00:19:59,540
I will choose neither of them.

477
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:00,510
Why?

478
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:02,130
That won't do.

479
00:20:02,330 --> 00:20:04,360
If you don't choose, the earth will be destroyed.

480
00:20:04,810 --> 00:20:06,260
Then let it be.

481
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:08,040
But I think

482
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:09,910
they look good together.

483
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:11,610
Why don't we let them pair up

484
00:20:11,950 --> 00:20:12,800
in case they harm others?

485
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:14,180
Fine.

486
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,210
Sit here and watch the competition yourself.

487
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:16,500
Zhuang Yan, vote.

488
00:20:16,870 --> 00:20:17,310
It's your turn.

489
00:20:17,910 --> 00:20:18,880
I won't get involved.

490
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:19,940
Besides,

491
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:21,640
will our votes work?

492
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:24,580
It depends on Ying.

493
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:34,100
I'm telling you,

494
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:35,650
it can't be wrong.

495
00:20:47,570 --> 00:20:49,330
Your shooting plan is not bad.

496
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:50,920
It only needs some improvement.

497
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:54,060
Yu Sicheng, good for you.

498
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:56,500
Your lighting plan

499
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:57,400
can be more specific.

500
00:20:57,420 --> 00:20:58,100
Director Zheng,

501
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,600
what do you think of our ideas?

502
00:21:06,950 --> 00:21:07,710
Let's go on.

503
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:10,910
I think this should be...

504
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:14,920
Let me see yours.

505
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:17,400
The situation is so tense.

506
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:20,490
I don't think we'll be able to get the winner for a while.

507
00:21:22,330 --> 00:21:24,520
I think it's hard for Ying to get married.

508
00:21:26,210 --> 00:21:27,120
What are you talking about?

509
00:21:33,470 --> 00:21:34,290
Come and have a look.

510
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:36,890
Someone sent you a gift today.

511
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:37,940
Take a look and guess who sent it.

512
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:41,650
Look at the package.

513
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:43,350
It's quite expensive.

514
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:44,460
Open it.

515
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:50,340
My goodness.

516
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:53,260
What kind of romantic plot is this?

517
00:21:53,910 --> 00:21:54,740
Who sent it?

518
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:55,660
Here. Here.

519
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:56,430
Have a look.

520
00:21:58,060 --> 00:21:59,610
"I want to invite you to my friend's dinner party

521
00:21:59,970 --> 00:22:01,300
as my partner."

522
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:03,260
"I wonder if I can have the honor."

523
00:22:03,770 --> 00:22:05,170
"Ye Zhiqiu."

524
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:13,980
In my opinion,

525
00:22:14,330 --> 00:22:14,980
Ying,

526
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:16,750
just grab this opportunity

527
00:22:17,010 --> 00:22:18,350
to get Prince Ye.

528
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:21,370
It's still early.

529
00:22:21,390 --> 00:22:22,170
What's more,

530
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:24,380
why is Ye Zhiqiu a prince?

531
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:25,770
He is at most

532
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:27,800
my cute little brother.

533
00:22:29,950 --> 00:22:33,110
If Prince Ye is happy...

534
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:35,720
Prince Zheng will be unhappy.

535
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:39,210
Stop talking nonsense.

536
00:22:39,910 --> 00:22:40,830
Neither of them are not my types.

537
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:43,360
I think both of them are the best.

538
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:45,140
Don't be ungrateful.

539
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:47,030
Look.

540
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:48,350
If you hesitate more,

541
00:22:48,390 --> 00:22:50,270
Jian will go for it himself!

542
00:22:50,290 --> 00:22:51,130
Of course.

543
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:52,110
I want to go.

544
00:22:52,130 --> 00:22:53,170
But no one invites me.

545
00:22:53,610 --> 00:22:54,920
Come on, this is your chance.

546
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:56,020
The dress is ready.

547
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:57,100
Go, Princess Elsa.

548
00:22:57,130 --> 00:22:58,620
Who's going to wear your dress to attend the party?

549
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:05,450
Do you like the present?

550
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:06,590
Thank you.

551
00:23:07,150 --> 00:23:07,670
Come down.

552
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:09,050
I have something to tell you.

553
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:10,900
Are you downstairs?

554
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:18,640
Come down.

555
00:23:19,430 --> 00:23:20,320
I have some words to tell you.

556
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:28,400
Chubby.

557
00:23:29,330 --> 00:23:30,830
When did you learn to pick up girls?

558
00:23:31,050 --> 00:23:32,760
You've learned to send flowers to girls.

559
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:35,150
Is the dress beautiful?

560
00:23:35,570 --> 00:23:36,410
You have good taste.

561
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:41,020
I...

562
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:43,280
I have something to tell you.

563
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:43,740
Stop.

564
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:47,300
Are you going to declare your love for me?

565
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:49,000
We are

566
00:23:49,090 --> 00:23:50,230
brothers forever.

567
00:23:50,530 --> 00:23:51,570
You'll always be my little brother.

568
00:23:51,590 --> 00:23:52,790
I'll always be your female big brother.

569
00:23:53,490 --> 00:23:54,310
Don't cross the line.

570
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:55,940
I don't care.

571
00:23:56,590 --> 00:23:57,240
I just want to say it.

572
00:23:58,430 --> 00:23:58,810
Shen Ying.

573
00:23:59,450 --> 00:24:00,070
I like you.

574
00:24:04,470 --> 00:24:05,250
Actually,

575
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:06,990
I can feel

576
00:24:08,330 --> 00:24:09,110
you don't like me.

577
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:16,030
Do you remember when we were young?

578
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:17,640
Once after school,

579
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:20,140
because I didn't finish cleaning the classroom,

580
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,080
I stayed at the class till the last,

581
00:24:21,850 --> 00:24:22,770
which caused the monitor on duty

582
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:25,310
to stay with me.

583
00:24:26,090 --> 00:24:27,520
Because I was very fat when I was young.

584
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:30,040
I felt inferior.

585
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:31,690
I didn't have many friends.

586
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:34,420
The monitor called me a stupid pig.

587
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:36,440
I believed it myself.

588
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:37,920
I thought

589
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:40,130
no one would care about me.

590
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:42,230
If it weren't for you,

591
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:43,660
I would have gone home

592
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:44,620
and cried under the quilt.

593
00:24:46,130 --> 00:24:46,960
It's you who told me

594
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:49,170
to believe in myself.

595
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:50,620
Be confident.

596
00:24:52,250 --> 00:24:55,090
You gave me a lot of courage,

597
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:59,360
including the one to confess my love to you today.

598
00:25:01,210 --> 00:25:01,710
It's you

599
00:25:02,810 --> 00:25:04,100
who made me want to be a better person.

600
00:25:14,350 --> 00:25:15,310
If I were you,

601
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:17,790
I would take a leave and rest for two days.

602
00:25:16,030 --> 00:25:16,660
[Invitation]

603
00:25:18,530 --> 00:25:19,410
Why the leave?

604
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:19,980
Are you sick?

605
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:21,110
Only when I rested well

606
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:21,940
would I be able to

607
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:24,000
go to the party with Ye Zhiqiu in two days.

608
00:25:28,410 --> 00:25:29,060
Director Zheng.

609
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:33,520
I was just kidding.

610
00:25:34,030 --> 00:25:35,100
I need to go to the restroom.

611
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:38,410
He's talking nonsense.

612
00:25:38,730 --> 00:25:40,000
How could I ask for leave?

613
00:25:40,130 --> 00:25:40,950
Work first.

614
00:25:43,630 --> 00:25:44,220
I've seen this.

615
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:44,690
Not bad.

616
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:47,140
Thank you, Director.

617
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:20,030
Hello, what's up?

618
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:21,370
Mate, it's me.

619
00:26:21,890 --> 00:26:24,320
I heard there's an opening dinner in Liumu Hall.

620
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:26,350
You are well-informed.

621
00:26:26,490 --> 00:26:27,250
You even know that?

622
00:26:28,710 --> 00:26:29,160
Mate,

623
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:30,450
actually, I...

624
00:26:30,890 --> 00:26:31,600
I still...

625
00:26:31,630 --> 00:26:32,100
What?

626
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:33,280
You want to go, right?

627
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:34,070
Yes.

628
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:37,520
I'm not familiar with the landlady of Liumu Hall.

629
00:26:37,790 --> 00:26:40,250
But Sis Qin is quite familiar with Xu Duo.

630
00:26:40,430 --> 00:26:41,020
Sis Qin?

631
00:26:41,590 --> 00:26:42,130
Sis Qin.

632
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:44,020
I'm Xu Duo's friend, Fang Siwei.

633
00:26:44,110 --> 00:26:45,080
We met in Beijing before.

634
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:45,890
Do you remember me?

635
00:26:45,910 --> 00:26:46,670
I remember you.

636
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:47,540
Thank you, Sis Qin.

637
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:49,420
It's Sis Qin

638
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:50,810
who chased after Xu Duo many years ago?

639
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:52,830
You still remember that?

640
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:54,170
It's so funny.

641
00:26:56,010 --> 00:26:56,340
Fine.

642
00:26:56,610 --> 00:26:57,340
I got it, Mate.

643
00:26:57,340 --> 00:26:57,760
Thank you.

644
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:01,620
Dr Xu.

645
00:27:01,910 --> 00:27:02,390
What?

646
00:27:02,930 --> 00:27:03,740
Seven o'clock tonight.

647
00:27:03,930 --> 00:27:04,890
At Restaurant Si.

648
00:27:06,370 --> 00:27:07,330
You have a conscience now?

649
00:27:08,610 --> 00:27:10,060
I'll leave Sis Qin to you.

650
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:14,400
I'm here. I'm here.

651
00:27:14,530 --> 00:27:14,990
Sis Qin.

652
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:15,940
Long time no see.

653
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:16,580
Don't call me sis.

654
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:17,660
It sounds like I am older.

655
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:18,730
Just call me Jun.

656
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:19,740
Hello, Dr Xu.

657
00:27:19,850 --> 00:27:20,850
Are you mad, Zheng Dao?

658
00:27:20,910 --> 00:27:21,750
What are you doing?

659
00:27:22,070 --> 00:27:23,460
There's an opening dinner in Liumu Hall.

660
00:27:23,570 --> 00:27:24,240
I wanna attend.

661
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:25,670
Is Shen Ying going too?

662
00:27:26,790 --> 00:27:27,240
Yes.

663
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:28,140
I'll go as well if she goes.

664
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:29,460
You sold your brother for a woman.

665
00:27:30,030 --> 00:27:31,220
The point is that it is...

666
00:27:32,050 --> 00:27:32,920
Sis Qin.

667
00:27:34,010 --> 00:27:35,840
You have to do anything for your brother.

668
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:38,150
Sis, recently...

669
00:27:38,170 --> 00:27:38,810
No, Jun,

670
00:27:39,170 --> 00:27:40,410
recently, really...

671
00:27:40,530 --> 00:27:41,410
Look, after so many years,

672
00:27:41,430 --> 00:27:42,510
I still think you haven't changed a bit.

673
00:27:42,710 --> 00:27:44,270
Dr Xu is getting more and more good-looking.

674
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:45,620
Not at all.

675
00:27:45,650 --> 00:27:46,010
I mean it.

676
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:47,180
Compared to you,

677
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,120
I am way left behind.

678
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:49,930
Jun, let me give you another set of skin care products.

679
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:51,380
Sure. Great.

680
00:27:52,150 --> 00:27:52,990
Next time.

681
00:27:53,060 --> 00:27:53,860
