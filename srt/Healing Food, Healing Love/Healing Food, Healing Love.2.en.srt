00:01:35,690 --> 00:01:36,620
Of course,

4
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:37,780
the one with the best data

5
00:01:38,570 --> 00:01:39,210
is Shen Ying.

6
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:40,210
I'm sorry.

7
00:01:41,229 --> 00:01:41,990
I'm sorry.

8
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:43,050
Director, I'm sorry.

9
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:45,530
What? You?

10
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:48,780
Sit down.

11
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:57,660
What's going on?

12
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:06,100
Okay.

13
00:02:06,370 --> 00:02:07,250
Let's continue.

14
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:08,810
This Black Pearl Restaurant

15
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,280
has won the first place in all the lists

16
00:02:10,509 --> 00:02:12,180
in just one hour.

17
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:14,090
The data of forwarding is also very good.

18
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:17,380
Thank you for your support, everyone.

19
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:18,450
Thank you.

20
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:26,170
But

21
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:27,660
I think

22
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:29,010
90% of this report

23
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:30,350
was fabricated

24
00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:31,520
by Editor Shen.

25
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:32,860
It doesn't focus on

26
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:34,660
the making or the presentation

27
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:35,540
of the dishes.

28
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:36,940
Instead, it focuses mainly

29
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:39,550
on some privacy that has nothing to do with cooking.

30
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:41,140
I think Editor Shen

31
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:42,380
is fit to be transferred to our Entertainment Department

32
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:43,300
and to be an entertainment reporter.

33
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:45,340
You'll definitely shine

34
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:46,070
like a diamond there.

35
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,040
Hey you, paratrooper.

36
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:49,050
It should be Director.

37
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:53,420
Okay.

38
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:55,380
Mr. Director,

39
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:57,740
maybe you haven't  worked out the situation yet.

40
00:02:58,370 --> 00:02:59,510
This report was added urgently.

41
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:00,790
The market and business sector

42
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:02,300
only gave me 24 hours.

43
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,690
I had to hand in the draft that afternoon.

44
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:05,550
Please tell me how I could have time

45
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:07,660
to do an in-depth research and interview?

46
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:08,740
Having no time?

47
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:10,170
Can that be the reason you fabricated it?

48
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:11,880
If you think the work assignment is unreasonable,

49
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:13,340
you can refuse and file a complaint.

50
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:14,980
Maybe because you just came back,

51
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:16,690
you still don't understand the situation in China.

52
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:18,860
We put expediency over other factors

53
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:20,210
when it's urgent.

54
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:20,980
Firstly,

55
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:22,020
I didn't come back yesterday.

56
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:22,840
Secondly,

57
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:25,100
in my view, this is just your own empiricism.

58
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:26,380
Isen

59
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:29,220
becomes one of the magazines with the biggest circulation in the world,

60
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,380
which I don't think relies only on expediency.

61
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:33,450
All right.

62
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:35,130
Please calm down.

63
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:37,579
Shen Ying, sit down.

64
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:40,010
Have a seat, Director Zheng.

65
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:46,630
Director Zheng brought us

66
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:47,840
many subversive views today.

67
00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:48,940
Good.

68
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:50,390
New Media Department

69
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:51,460

70
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:52,560
to promote its development.

71
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,890
I think we may also need

72
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:57,050
some time

73
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:58,250
to adapt to each other.

74
00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:00,630

75
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:02,170
is patient enough.

76
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:03,390

81
00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:12,130
provide us with a brand new perspective and direction.

82

According to the data monitoring of Marketing Department,

83
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:16,010
a private home cuisine restaurant

84
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:17,769
is emerging really fast recently.

85
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:21,029
The popularity of this restaurant

86
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:22,730
has reached the top of the professional list.

87
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:24,950
This restaurant is very special.

88
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:25,830
In public,

89
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:28,100
it never adopts the business mode of monetizing popularity.

90
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:29,200
It adopts a reservation system.

91
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,600
Plus, this restaurant

92
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:34,260
has never agreed to be interviewed by any media.

93
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:35,480
Its operation is very low-profile.

94
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:37,780
I think if we can get

95
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:39,480
its first in-depth report,

96
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:41,909
it will be the first big event

97

of our New Media Department.

98
00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:47,050
Only... it's very difficult.

99
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:49,740
I'll go.

100

What do you think, Director Zheng?

101
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:54,940
Sure.

102
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:56,230
How about the deadline of your report?

103
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:58,020
Within 24 hours.

104

I'm looking forward to it.

I have this invitation card,

120

so can I skip the reservation?

121

Of course.

122

you can only enjoy our basic set meal.

Nice to meet you.

146

Our chef is quite picky.

147

Take the mysterious chef who's busy with the career for example.

175
00:08:10,530 --> 00:08:11,980
He thinks about food whole-heartedly.

176
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:13,700
But to participate in

177
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,110
a world-class chef competition,

178
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:16,380
he failed to meet

179
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:18,330
his terminally ill lover for the last time.

180
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:21,820
To commemorate his lover,

181
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:23,990
he replaced the scallop with egg white,

182
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:25,850
to remind himself of this

183
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,280
and to commemorate his love.

184
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:30,500
Because the egg white without the yolk

185
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:32,429
is just like himself without his lover,

186
00:08:33,330 --> 00:08:34,080
it will never be complete anymore.

187
00:08:34,530 --> 00:08:36,780
Add an egg to the instant noodles, and bad luck will get lost.

188
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:56,740
What's going on?

189
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:58,620
That jinx hasn't replied yet.

190
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:01,390
The new layout is sent. I'll forward it to our group chat.

191
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:02,260
Okay.

192
00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:07,040
What's going on?

193
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:09,780
Zhang,

194
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:11,780
why is the front page article replaced by Director's article?

195
00:09:19,730 --> 00:09:20,100
Come in.

196
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:32,740
Director,

197
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:34,180
have you received the special feature

198
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,840
I sent you last night?

199
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:45,940
Here's the thing.

200
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,380
I planned to

201
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:48,720
publish it today,

202
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:50,450
but you haven't replied all day.

203
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:51,900
Then I saw today's front page article

204
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:52,940
was suddenly changed to your article.

205
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:54,450
So I want to ask what your plan is.

206
00:09:54,450 --> 00:09:55,490
I've read your article.

207
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:57,430
The part where you cited Matt Haig

208
00:09:57,460 --> 00:09:58,100
is not bad,

209
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:00,380
but all the other parts are meaningless.

210
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:02,960
So there's no point in replying you.

211
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:05,380
How is my article meaningless?

212
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:13,530
Did you really eat the food of that restaurant?

213
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,820
Of course.

214
00:10:16,930 --> 00:10:17,420
Really?

215
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,440
Do you think I don't want to eat?

216
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:22,490
Why?

217
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:23,060
Also,

218
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:25,180
that love story is unnecessary.

219
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:26,540
Director, do you have

220
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:27,950
prejudice against love stories?

221
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:29,860
Our readers are most interested in them.

222
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:31,490
That's your personal experience.

223
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:32,540
Isen's popularity is gained

224
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,640
by professional food reviews.

225
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:36,060
We write about food,

226
00:10:36,290 --> 00:10:36,980
instead of interviews.

227
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:39,040
Even if my article about food

228
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:40,220
can't meet your requirements,

229
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:41,970
but what exists is reasonable.

230
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:43,350
Darwinism

231
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:45,990
shouldn't be applied on food reviews.

232
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:54,300
I feel that you're so naive

233
00:10:54,370 --> 00:10:56,280
that you think one dish represents a restaurant.

234
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:57,860
I don't think you should waste

235
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:59,120
the invitation card Miranda gave you.

236
00:10:59,330 --> 00:11:00,140
Go have some food there again.

237
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:06,700
I hope you

238
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,430
won't bring personal grudges to work.

239
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:10,440
You judge others based on your first impressions again.

240
00:11:11,290 --> 00:11:12,840
Everyone is different.

241
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:15,040
Maybe you're the only one who thinks I abuse public power to avenge a personal wrong.

242
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:17,150
Aren't you taking revenge on me under the pretext of company affairs?

243
00:11:17,770 --> 00:11:19,700
If this is your attitude and way of working,

244
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:21,150
is it what you always insist on?

245
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,070
One more thing.

246
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:30,860
I didn't call the police when you took me to the hotel.

247
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:31,660
I've cut you some slack already.

248
00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:33,170
Don't push your luck.

249
00:11:34,930 --> 00:11:35,600
Well,

250
00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:37,460
I did it out of the sense of justice of a normal man.

251
00:11:37,890 --> 00:11:39,060
Taking a half-naked

252
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:40,290
drunk woman

253
00:11:40,610 --> 00:11:42,090
out of a bar full of perverts,

254
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:44,040
I would like to ask you, decent Miss Shen,

255
00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:45,210
what is wrong with that?

256
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:49,910
Please close the door when you leave.

257
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:50,620
Thank you.

258
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:12,290
I've worked all night for nothing.

259
00:12:12,530 --> 00:12:13,290
The bonus is gone, too.

260
00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:15,740
There, there, my dear Ying.

261
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:17,100
Bad luck!

262
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:21,170
I will ask all my connections to find the boss of Si.

263
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:22,180
I must eat in there.

264
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:25,060
A friend of mine said he knows the boss.

265
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,930
Why don't we go to a Karaoke bar tonight?

266
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:28,220
He will attend my birthday party, too.

267
00:12:28,830 --> 00:12:29,940
We call him Master Yu, Yu Sicheng.

268
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:31,060
That's great.

269
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:31,580
Let's talk in person.

270
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:36,510
[Restaurant Si]

271
00:12:41,650 --> 00:12:42,930
Your magazine sent a journalist here to interview.

272
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:43,820
A young girl.

273
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:44,700
She's quite cute.

274
00:12:45,170 --> 00:12:45,700
Cute?

275
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:46,420
Yeah.

276
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:47,680
She said she came to interview.

277
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:49,170
What did she write?

278
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:52,290
Do you care about the guidance of public opionion?

279
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:53,080
I do.

280
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:54,700
Okay.

281
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:57,370
Come on. Take a look.

282
00:12:58,060 --> 00:12:59,340
Let me read it.

283
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:04,600
The exclusive interview of the private home cuisine restaurant Si.

284
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:06,820
Everyone says

285
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,500
the chef of Si has a bad temper.

286
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:11,180
Only when customers savor the food

287
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:12,860
with respect in their heart,

288
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,940
can they eat the most dedicated delicacies

289
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,680
prepared by this mysterious chef.

290
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:20,710
Take the mysterious chef who's busy with the career for example.

291
00:13:20,770 --> 00:13:22,640
He thinks about food whole-heartedly.

292
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:24,180
But to participate in

293
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:26,230
a world-class chef competition,

294
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:29,170
he broke up with his lover.

295
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:31,280
What a master of fabricating rumors!

296
00:13:31,570 --> 00:13:33,630
I think the young lady's writing is quite appropriate.

297
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,130
Excuse me?

298
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:36,270
Come on, bro.

299
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,070
It's a joke.

300
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:39,720
Okay, I take that.

301
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:44,670
Fang, I’m here.

302
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:56,670
Does Bai

303
00:13:56,850 --> 00:13:58,960
yearn for a career of being a chef?

304
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:02,260
I think she has some resentment

305
00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:03,690
about being a chef.

306
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:05,790
Yoyo, give me a glass of water.

307
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:08,530
Thank you.

308
00:14:16,610 --> 00:14:17,600
You ran away from home again?

309
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:21,540
Tell me,

310
00:14:21,710 --> 00:14:23,160
have you changed the Wi-Fi password?

311
00:14:23,370 --> 00:14:25,210
Will you be responsible if I can't pass TOEFL and go abroad?

312
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,090
How many times?

313
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:30,130
Just 234 or 256 times.

314
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:33,620
Bai,

315
00:14:34,210 --> 00:14:36,090
going abroad is not the best choice.

316
00:14:36,390 --> 00:14:37,480
Don't be so stressed.

317
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:40,060
How can you call crossing an overpass running away from home?

318
00:14:40,330 --> 00:14:41,150
I’m speechless.

319
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:44,260
Give Bai the same dish too.

320
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:46,820
Alright.

321
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:47,890
I have to go now.

322
00:14:48,090 --> 00:14:48,710
I'm going to a Karaoke bar.

323
00:14:49,970 --> 00:14:50,460
You?

324
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:51,970
Karaoke?

325
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:54,760
I forgot my keys.

326
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:56,060
I'll find Xu Duo to get the spare keys.

327
00:14:57,690 --> 00:14:59,010
You should change your lock to a combination one.

328
00:14:59,770 --> 00:15:00,960
I'll do it when I'm free. I'm leaving.

329
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:01,850
Bye.

330
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:02,380
Bye.

331
00:15:19,930 --> 00:15:20,530
I'm coming up.

332
00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:21,230
Which room?

333
00:15:23,710 --> 00:15:24,610
The man I want to introduce to you

334
00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:25,340
is here.

335
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:26,800
Be careful.

336
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:30,300
Sicheng.

337
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:31,770
Fan Jian.

338
00:15:32,930 --> 00:15:33,800
Happy birthday.

339
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:34,410
Thank you.

340
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:35,380
Let me introduce you two.

341
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:36,950
This is my best friend, Shen Ying.

342
00:15:37,630 --> 00:15:39,560
This is Yu Sicheng, Master Yu.

343
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:41,880
He's familiar with

344
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:42,630
all the high-end restaurants.

345
00:15:42,810 --> 00:15:43,730
Whichever restaurant you want to go,

346
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:44,520
he can handle it.

347
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:45,570
Really?

348
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:47,350
Hello, Master Yu.

349
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:48,050
I've heard a lot about you.

350
00:15:48,290 --> 00:15:49,200
I'll rely on you then.

351
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:51,130
Just tell me the name of the place.

352
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:53,330
Which four restaurants are so arrogant?

353
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,570
You can't even eat there after waiting for a month.

354
00:15:55,610 --> 00:15:56,560
Is he reliable?

355
00:15:57,450 --> 00:15:57,820
How about this?

356
00:15:58,060 --> 00:15:58,900
You go in and drink first.

357
00:15:59,020 --> 00:15:59,860
We'll talk later.

358
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:03,110
Have fun first.

359
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,030
Maybe he confused the name of Restaurant Si

360
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:07,260
with the number four which sounds exactly the same with Si.

361
00:16:07,310 --> 00:16:08,400
Don't worry. I'll handle it.

362
00:16:08,810 --> 00:16:10,070
I'm running on fumes,

363
00:16:10,090 --> 00:16:11,840
and you're telling me a joke?

364
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:12,660
Do you believe I can kill you?

365
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:13,660
No, please, it's my birthday.

366
00:16:13,690 --> 00:16:14,460
Don't say killing.

367
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:19,150
I can handle it later, okay?

368
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:33,890
How unreliable.

369
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:48,780
Zhuang.

370
00:16:58,030 --> 00:16:59,380
Quiet, everyone.

371
00:17:01,010 --> 00:17:01,690
He's cueing me.

372
00:17:06,450 --> 00:17:07,690
Let me introduce her.

373
00:17:07,829 --> 00:17:10,430
This is the chief photographer in our company,

374
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:12,619
my best friend, Zhuang Yan.

375
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:14,220
Hello, everyone.

376
00:17:15,450 --> 00:17:17,300
She's like the star Yeung Chin-wah.

377
00:17:18,329 --> 00:17:19,490
Okay, let her sing a song.

378
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:20,450
I'll put the song up for you.

379
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:21,500
I really...

380
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:23,200
Hurry up.

381
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:33,250
♫There are ten thousand feelings of missing♫

382
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:37,430
♫The tears sink to the bottom of the sea♫

383
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:41,060
♫Merging into one♫

384
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:43,990
♫Put every piece of memory♫

385
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:46,160
♫Deep into your dream♫

386
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:49,170
♫Dark blue sighs go on♫

387
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:52,700
♫Dark blue sighs go on♫

388
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:56,600
♫I will awaken this pair of eyes♫

389
00:17:57,140 --> 00:17:59,880
♫And tell you♫

390
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:03,990
♫To listen to♫

391
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:06,960
♫The courage of tears♫

392
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:09,010
♫Because of you♫

393
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:12,390
♫Only for you♫

394
00:18:13,570 --> 00:18:14,740
♫I'm heart-broken♫

395
00:18:23,530 --> 00:18:24,570
I just got heart-broken.

396
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:26,810
I've also lost the remuneration and bonus of the article.

397
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:28,740
Nothing is going smoothly.

398
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:29,740
This room. Hurry up.

399
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:31,050
Why am I so unlucky?

400
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:33,300
Somebody help me!

401
00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:48,670
You're so forgetful.

402
00:18:48,810 --> 00:18:49,820
Get a combination lock for yourself.

403
00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:50,780
Okay.

404
00:18:51,010 --> 00:18:51,300
Bye.

405
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:52,080
Why are you here?

406
00:18:52,350 --> 00:18:53,620
You're haunting me like a ghost.

407
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:56,240
It's illegal to destroy someone's family.

408
00:18:57,820 --> 00:18:58,850
You're pregnant.

409
00:18:58,870 --> 00:19:00,310
Can you control your emotions?

410
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:01,770
Don't make a scene and act like a shrew.

411
00:19:02,650 --> 00:19:03,580
Shrew?

412
00:19:03,770 --> 00:19:04,810
Are you calling me a shrew?

413
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:05,630
Say it again. I dare you!

414
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:06,140
Sun Yue!

415
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:10,170
Sun Yue, what are you doing?

416
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:11,060
I'm socializing.

417
00:19:13,090 --> 00:19:13,900
I see.

418
00:19:14,370 --> 00:19:16,740
I knew you two hadn't broken up.

419
00:19:17,630 --> 00:19:18,700
I'm so pissed off.

420
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:20,960
You shameless witch!

421
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:29,220
Are you okay?

422
00:19:30,330 --> 00:19:32,180
You'll make me worried if you drink too much.

423
00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:35,590
Who are you?

424
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:39,920
I'm her boyfriend.

425
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:41,670
Why haven't I seen him before?

426
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:43,470
It's none of your business.

427
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:43,920
Shut up!

428
00:19:44,930 --> 00:19:45,390
Shen Ying,

429
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:47,300
I was wrong about you.

430
00:19:47,610 --> 00:19:49,350
You were just pretending to be innocent.

431
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:49,990
Liu Yu.

432
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:51,860
Watch your mouth.

433
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,530
My suit is custom-made.

434
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:55,020
Do you want to talk about the compensation?

435
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:55,290
You...

436
00:19:55,670 --> 00:19:56,260
No need.

437
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:57,360
It’s really haute couture.

438
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:58,460
Let's go.

439
00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:06,210
Your manuscript hasn't been approved,

440
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:07,330
yet instead of working overtime,

441
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:08,780
you come to stalk your ex-boyfriend?

442
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:11,720
-How am I in any mood to stalk him? -Is this real?

443
00:20:25,730 --> 00:20:26,570
Don't overthink.

444
00:20:26,690 --> 00:20:27,530
Don't gossip.

445
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:28,700
Nothing happened.

446
00:20:28,890 --> 00:20:29,770
Nothing.

447
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:33,210
Someone must be lying.

448
00:20:33,850 --> 00:20:36,660
Is it you whose words and deeds don't match,

449
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:40,300
or the pretentious Director Zheng?

450
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:45,400
You pretended to be enemies in front of everyone.

451
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:47,800
But actually you've hooked up long ago.

452
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:50,300
Tell us the truth.

453
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:51,060
Tell us the truth.

454
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:54,010
Stop gossiping.

455
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:55,920
Nothing happened, okay?

456
00:20:57,900 --> 00:20:58,540
There's a problem.

457
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:00,600
-There's a problem. -There's a problem.

458
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:02,650
-There's a problem. -There's a problem.

459
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:05,020
-There's a problem. -There's a problem.

460
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:14,980
Fan Jian.

461
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:17,080
Mr. Fan!

462
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:18,180
I've been calling you all night.

463
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:19,150
Why didn't you answer?

464
00:21:19,990 --> 00:21:21,230
I drank too much yesterday.

465
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:22,460
I won't drink so much anymore.

466
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:23,660
Forget it.

467
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:25,500
Let me ask you.

468
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:27,610
What's the name of that girl

469
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:28,720
who sang last night?

470
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:30,100
Who?

471
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:31,540
There were so many girls yesterday.

472
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:32,300
How could I remember?

473
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:34,740
Do you mean the girl who sang the love song?

474
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:36,340
She's my best friend.

475
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:37,820
We work in the same company.

476
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:38,710
Zhuang Yan.

477
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:40,070
Zhuang Yan!

478
00:21:40,570 --> 00:21:41,130
Tell me

479
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:42,440
the name of your company!

480
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:45,070
It's nothing.

481
00:21:45,330 --> 00:21:45,810
Okay.

482
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:46,780
Thank you. Bye.

483
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:50,680
Come on.

484
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:54,170
I don't understand.

485
00:21:54,170 --> 00:21:54,770
I'm here looking for someone.

486
00:21:54,770 --> 00:21:55,700
Why can't I go up?

487
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:56,740
You don't have a work identity card

488
00:21:56,790 --> 00:21:57,870
or a visitor's permit,

489
00:21:57,930 --> 00:21:59,530
so you can't enter the Isen Building.

490
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:00,580
Please go back.

491
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:00,840
Wait.

492
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,200
Please go back.

493
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:02,700
Sir,

494
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:05,260
how about this?

495
00:22:06,090 --> 00:22:08,460
Please tell your boss

496
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:10,830
a man named Yu Sicheng is waiting for him.

497
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:11,810
Take the message for me.

498
00:22:11,810 --> 00:22:13,050
It's useless to say this.

499
00:22:13,090 --> 00:22:14,060
Please go back.

500
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:14,900
Go back quickly.

501
00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:15,180
Wait,

502
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:16,620
can't I talk to you nicely?

503
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:17,830
Do you think I have a good temper?

504
00:22:17,850 --> 00:22:19,900
-I can be fierce, you know? -Why make a fuss so early?

505
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:22,450
The security guards work for the property management company.

506
00:22:22,730 --> 00:22:23,700
It's useless to talk to them.

507
00:22:25,670 --> 00:22:26,810
Teacher Zhuang.

508
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:27,660
Beauty Zhuang.

509
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:29,000
