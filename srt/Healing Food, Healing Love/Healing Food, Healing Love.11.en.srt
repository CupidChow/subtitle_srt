[Episode 11]

3
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:38,900
Zheng Dao.

4
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:47,039
What's going on?

5
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:48,479
Why are there women's shoes?

6
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:54,759
Zheng Dao, come and eat.

7
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:56,400
You must be Xu Duo.

8
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:57,280
I'm Shen Ying.

9
00:01:57,460 --> 00:01:58,410
I'm making breakfast.

10
00:01:58,410 --> 00:01:59,300
Do you want to eat with us?

11
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:00,850
What are you making?

12
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:02,740
You'll find out later.

13
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:03,780
Come on.

14
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,160
You came uninvited again.

15
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,090
Have a seat.

16
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:16,390
Wait.

17
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:19,460
Your relationship advances too fast.

18
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:21,600
What's wrong?

19
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:23,310
You were caught in bed,

20
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:24,120
and dare not admit it?

21
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:24,880
I think you...

22
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:39,130
Am I dreaming?

23
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:40,140
Dr Xu,

24
00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:42,230
don't make a fuss over nothing.

25
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:42,940
Sit.

26
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:44,290
Okay.

27
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:48,270
How is it?

28
00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:51,120
The Eight Treasure Rice made with my secret recipe is not bad, right?

29
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:52,270
Ying.

30
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:53,660
Didn't you tell me before

31
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,120
you would only cook this for me?

32
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,050
I'd say this to whoever

33
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:00,600
wants to eat my food.

34
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:02,790
Humph.

35
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:05,080
By the way,

36
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:06,620
this Eight Treasure Rice Congee

37
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:08,780
strengthens spleen and stomach, and soothes the nerves.

38
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:10,050
It's suitable for people who are

39
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:11,690
overweight or suffer from nervosism.

40
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:13,700
Yes, that's right.

41
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:14,470
Shen Ying,

42
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:15,980
why did you go out of your way like this?

43
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:16,780
What are you celebrating?

44
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:19,970
Of course I'm celebrating our Gourmet colomn

45
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,660
becoming the No. 1 among all the magazine columns in China.

46
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,650
I have nothing to do with it then.

47
00:03:25,579 --> 00:03:28,030
Congratulations on you becoming a big shot in the domestic dessert domain.

48
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:36,670
Tastes good.

49
00:03:37,079 --> 00:03:37,520
Shen Ying,

50
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:39,350
I didn't expect you to cook so well.

51
00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:41,500
No wonder you have attracted my

52
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,280
distant and cold friend.

53
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:44,829
He asked me to specially bring back

54
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:46,810
limited edition women's shoes from abroad.

55
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:48,000
Xu Duo!

56
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:49,310
You're awesome.

57
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:54,310
It's the least I can do.

58
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:23,710
Police investigation.

59
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:25,200
You have the right to remain silent.

60
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:26,430
Anything you say

61
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:27,630
can and will be used against you in a court of law.

62
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:28,610
Well,

63
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,400
leniency to those who confess; severity to those who resist.

64
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:32,140
What happened?

65
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,070
You stayed out all night.

66
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:35,680
You didn't come home all night.

67
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:37,480
All night!

68
00:04:38,909 --> 00:04:41,780
Did you go to Prince Ye's hotel

69
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:45,090
or Mr. Zheng's room?

70
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:49,290
My stomach suddenly hurts.

71
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:50,310
What a lame excuse.

72
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:51,620
Tell us.

73
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:52,330
Tell us.

74
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:55,130
They drank themselves

75
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:56,150
under the table last night.

76
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:57,380
Then I went to pick them up.

77
00:04:57,450 --> 00:04:59,040
That's why I've been restless until this morning.

78
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:00,900
You haven't slept the whole night?

79
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:03,400
Don't talk nonsense.

80
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:05,530
But the key point is...

81
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:06,410
which one of them

82
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:07,830
made you go out

83
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:10,050
in the middle of the night,

84
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:12,270
since you're so lazy?

85
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:15,420
Anyhow...

86
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:18,390
it's not Chubby.

87
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:19,660
Then it must be Zheng Dao.

88
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:22,900
Do you really like him?

89
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:26,250
Oh no, no, no...

90
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:28,580
-What should we do? - Zheng Dao is not easy to deal with.

91
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:30,080
Then...

92
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:32,320
you are in a relationship?

93
00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:39,260
I don't know.

94
00:05:45,330 --> 00:05:45,970
Zheng Dao...

95
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:48,150
is not bad.

96
00:05:49,730 --> 00:05:50,540
He's just a bit dark-skinned.

97
00:05:58,140 --> 00:05:59,590
Why is Zheng Dao so funny?

98
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:01,000
He's got a great sense of humor.

99
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:03,300
Who are these two girls?

100
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:05,640
Why did Zheng Dao take pictures with so many beautiful girls?

101
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:06,980
You have nagged me

102
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:09,500
168 times today.

103
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:10,700
I'm so annoyed.

104
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:11,390
Stop it.

105
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:13,720
Hi, how have you been today?

106
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:15,560
Are you hungry?

107
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:16,790
May I buy you dinner?

108
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:27,790
Have you eaten?

109
00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:29,640
I accidentally ordered a double meal.

110
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:30,220
My treat.

111
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:35,070
Morning. Eat...

112
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:36,500
No.

113
00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:37,630
It's not morning, but evening.

114
00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:39,780
Do you want to have dinner? Shall we go?

115
00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:44,050
Forget it.

116
00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:46,560
I'd better not disturb her.

117
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:51,570
Shall we have dinner together tonight?

118
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,610
Shall we have dinner together tonight?

119
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:06,740
Miranda, are you looking for me?

120
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:07,640
Come in.

121
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,970
How is your special feature

122
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:18,350
Taste and Flavor going?

123
00:07:19,090 --> 00:07:20,040
It's going well.

124
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:21,370
The shop has been chosen.

125
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:23,650
The only thing left is to go there in person.

126
00:07:24,290 --> 00:07:24,940
Well done.

127
00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:29,170
Ye Zhiqiu takes a very early flight

128
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:29,870
to go back to Italy tomorrow.

129
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,310
So soon?

130
00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:33,790
Ye Zhiqiu is a top dessert chef.

131
00:07:34,570 --> 00:07:35,320
He is very creative.

132
00:07:36,170 --> 00:07:36,860
Maybe

133
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,490
we'll have another chance to work together.

134
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,030
You and Zheng Dao go see him off tomorrow,

135
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:44,700
on behalf of Isen.

136
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:49,760
I know you two are good friends.

137
00:07:49,909 --> 00:07:50,659
If you see him off,

138
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:51,830
he will be very happy.

139
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:55,880
No problem.

140
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:56,930
That's good.

141
00:07:57,540 --> 00:07:58,210
I'm leaving then.

142
00:07:58,350 --> 00:07:58,750
Go.

143
00:08:05,770 --> 00:08:06,360
Chubby.

144
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:08,780
Why are you here?

145
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:09,560
To see you off.

146
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:11,160
Come on, let me give you a ride.

147
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:11,930
No need.

148
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:13,580
I've already booked a taxi.

149
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:14,760
If we cancel it now,

150
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:15,830
it's not fair to the taxi driver.

151
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:17,900
You really don't need it?

152
00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:19,970
Zheng Dao.

153
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:23,340
Come.

154
00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:30,060
This letter

155
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:32,559
is about everything Shen Ying likes.

156
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:35,799
I wanted to leave it at the reception.

157
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:37,510
Since you're here,

158
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:39,400
I'll give it to you directly.

159
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:41,530
Thank you.

160
00:08:43,809 --> 00:08:44,760
If I have a chance to win her over,

161
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:46,270
I will still seize it.

162
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:50,380
Okay, I got it.

163
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:55,240
All right.

164
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:57,030
I'm leaving.

165
00:08:58,100 --> 00:08:58,540
Shen Ying,

166
00:08:58,940 --> 00:08:59,740
take care of yourself.

167
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:00,620
Don't make me worry.

168
00:09:00,890 --> 00:09:01,540
Be assured.

169
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:02,740
When you arrive,

170
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:03,780
remember to call me.

171
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:05,200
OK.

172
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:07,790
Zhiqiu,

173
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:10,320
take good care of yourself over there.

174
00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:11,170
Have a safe trip.

175
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:13,180
-Enough. -Bye.

176
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,120
Move over.

177
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:15,310
Here.

178
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:20,230
Go.

179
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:21,310
Bye.

180
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:26,580
Take care.

181
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:27,330
Have a safe trip.

182
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:28,340
Bye.

183
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:28,940
Bye.

184
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,390
Bye.

185
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:44,040
What were you two talking about so stealthily?

186
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:46,940
Nothing.

187
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:50,130
I'm neither stupid nor blind, okay?

188
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:52,340
Did you two make some shady deal

189
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:53,980
behind my back?

190
00:09:55,830 --> 00:09:56,470
I suddenly remember

191
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:57,300
there's something to do in Fang's restaurant.

192
00:09:57,380 --> 00:09:58,090
Come with me.

193
00:09:58,620 --> 00:09:59,060
Let's go.

194
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:00,190
Why are we going to Fang's restaurant?

195
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:01,220
I have to clock in.

196
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:04,210
Think of it as dispatched work ordered by Director Zheng.

197
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:05,500
Mentor,

198
00:10:05,810 --> 00:10:06,930
you must be hot.

199
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,320
Hurry up.

200
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:10,400
Let me take it.

201
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:11,580
I'm not hot.

202
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:16,320
The sun is scorching.

203
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:17,480
Don't get burnt.

204
00:10:17,530 --> 00:10:18,250
I'll block the sunshine for you.

205
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:23,260
Take a rest.

206
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:24,640
This one looks good.

207
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:25,970
Don't touch. I'm modifying it.

208
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,550
You do shoot great photos.

209
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:32,330
By the way, mentor,

210
00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:33,130
are you hungry?

211
00:10:34,130 --> 00:10:34,650
No.

212
00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:36,820
No means yes.

213
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:37,690
Okay.

214
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:39,050
I know.

215
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:40,580
Wait for me.

216
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:45,110
No means yes?

217
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:55,410
Are they looking good?

218
00:10:55,850 --> 00:10:56,640
Choose one.

219
00:10:57,020 --> 00:10:58,630
Do you want this or this?

220
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:00,930
I'll have a try.

221
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:01,990
Let me help you.

222
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:06,020
I'll pick a color that suits you.

223
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:09,170
Here, open your mouth.

224
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,540
I'll do it myself.

225
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:15,340
Thank you.

226
00:11:19,650 --> 00:11:20,220
Does it taste good?

227
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:24,050
Have some more.

228
00:11:32,890 --> 00:11:33,890
Coming.

229
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:35,480
Shen Ying.

230
00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:36,890
Shen Ying!

231
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:37,580
Bai?

232
00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:40,340
Fang is taking care of grandpa in the hospital.

233
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,230
So he has no time to take care of her.

234
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:42,480
Li Bai,

235
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:44,260
obey Shen Ying these days,

236
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:45,300
and study hard.

237
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:45,780
Got it?

238
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:47,030
Got it.

239
00:11:47,210 --> 00:11:48,890
Just tell grandpa to rest well in the hospital.

240
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:50,150
I'll behave here.

241
00:11:50,970 --> 00:11:52,210
Grandpa behaves better than you, okay?

242
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:52,750
Go.

243
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:55,320
How is it going?

244
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:56,990
Grandpa Li is not doing well.

245
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:58,630
It's not convenient for Li Bai to stay at my place,

246
00:11:58,850 --> 00:11:59,890
so I brought her here.

247
00:12:00,410 --> 00:12:01,310
Thank you for all the trouble.

248
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:03,940
Don't mention it.

249
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:06,520
Bai and I are good friends, okay?

250
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:08,180
Go back to your business.

251
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:09,600
I guess Fang

252
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:10,690
must need help.

253
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:11,760
Okay, I'm off then.

254
00:12:12,070 --> 00:12:12,520
Bye.

255
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:13,150
Take care.

256
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:14,460
Bye.

257
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:27,250
Ying.

258
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,290
Let me tell you a secret.

259
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:32,380
Go ahead.

260
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:34,710
Are you in love with someone?

261
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:38,750
How did you know I was going to tell you this?

262
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,650
I'm smart.

263
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,070
Tell me which handsome guy it is.

264
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:43,170
Show me the photo.

265
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:49,810
Ying.

266
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:53,890
It's...

267
00:12:56,110 --> 00:13:00,240
Fang Siwei.

268
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:07,250
Bai,

269
00:13:08,810 --> 00:13:10,620
Mr. Fang is indeed an excellent

270
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,080
and charming person.

271
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:13,740
He deserves your love.

272
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:15,850
You don't object?

273
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:16,850
Why should I?

274
00:13:17,810 --> 00:13:19,850
I think true love

275
00:13:21,890 --> 00:13:23,970
shouldn't be restricted by the outside world.

276
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:26,010
Thank you, Ying.

277
00:13:26,530 --> 00:13:28,320
Why are you thanking me, silly girl?

278
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:30,770
I should thank you.

279
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:33,990
Your purity and courage

280
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:37,330
are like a mirror,

281
00:13:38,390 --> 00:13:40,640
reflecting the cowardice and prejudice

282
00:13:42,050 --> 00:13:42,770
of adults like us.

283
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:43,930
Shen Ying,

284
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:46,450
I know who you like, too.

285
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:49,490
Zheng...

286
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:50,710
Stop.

287
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:54,220
Just keep it to yourself.

288
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:55,330
Okay.

289
00:13:58,220 --> 00:13:58,850
All right.

290
00:13:58,870 --> 00:13:59,550
I'm going to sleep.

291
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:00,020
Go to sleep.

292
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:00,800
I'll keep it a secret for you.

293
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:01,990
Okay. Hurry up.

294
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,590
Bai needs to grow taller.

295
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:04,590
Good night. Good night.

296
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:05,180
Go to sleep.

297
00:14:36,770 --> 00:14:37,620
Let go!

298
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:38,830
Let go of me!

299
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:40,890
It's impossible for us.

300
00:14:44,610 --> 00:14:45,440
Don't come to me again.

301
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:16,860
Good morning, Director Zheng.

302
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:17,520
We're going to be late.

303
00:15:18,830 --> 00:15:20,200
Hold on.

304
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:22,910
Director Zheng, Miss Shen Ying.

305
00:15:22,950 --> 00:15:23,830
Hello, Mr. Zheng. Hello, Miss Shen.

306
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:25,100
Hello. Hello.

307
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:34,970
He was fine yesterday.

308
00:15:35,190 --> 00:15:36,210
What happened?

309
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:37,980
Did I offend him?

310
00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:42,820
Hurry up.

311
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:44,670
I'm late.

312
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:49,200
Oh, Shen Ying.

313
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:52,810
I'm sorry, Shen Ying.

314
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:48,920
Director, you're here to get water too?

315
00:16:50,730 --> 00:16:51,130
Yes.

316
00:16:53,530 --> 00:16:54,090
Well,

317
00:16:54,770 --> 00:16:57,220
you're acting weird today.

318
00:16:59,610 --> 00:17:00,360
You're oversensitive.

319
00:17:26,010 --> 00:17:26,650
What are you doing?

320
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:28,470
You wrinkled my shirt.

321
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,040
Fan,

322
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:34,680
I have a question for you.

323
00:17:35,710 --> 00:17:36,520
Shoot.

324
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:40,860
I have a friend

325
00:17:41,630 --> 00:17:43,660
who has met some relationship problems recently.

326
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:46,430
Besides me and Zhuang Yan,

327
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:47,980
what other friends do you have?

328
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:54,250
It's not a real friend.

329
00:17:54,290 --> 00:17:54,960
She is

330
00:17:55,630 --> 00:17:58,510
a reader or a fan of mine.

331
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:00,630
She left me a message.

332
00:18:01,610 --> 00:18:02,430
She said

333
00:18:02,850 --> 00:18:04,190
she has encountered a problem recently.

334
00:18:04,870 --> 00:18:06,130
She was close to a man.

335
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:07,390
But then this man

336
00:18:07,410 --> 00:18:08,680
treats her very well at one time,

337
00:18:08,710 --> 00:18:09,790
and becomes cold at another.

338
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:12,090
He's cold and hot. Near and far.

339
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:14,040
Is he a love-rat?

340
00:18:15,490 --> 00:18:16,260
Not necessarily.

341
00:18:16,810 --> 00:18:17,640
It's just basic operation.

342
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:19,490
Confession of love

343
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:21,100
is what only kids do.

344
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:22,700
Adults should

345
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:24,490
play hard to get.

346
00:18:25,690 --> 00:18:26,330
So,

347
00:18:26,530 --> 00:18:28,920
just press him onto the wall.

348
00:18:29,890 --> 00:18:30,470
It's not me.

349
00:18:30,990 --> 00:18:32,380
It's my reader.

350
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:34,290
Okay, your reader.

351
00:18:34,490 --> 00:18:35,590
Be straight forward.

352
00:18:36,290 --> 00:18:36,780
Press him.

353
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:37,770
And ask him,

354
00:18:39,170 --> 00:18:39,930
"what do you mean?"

355
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:44,610
Does it have to be so direct?

356
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:47,540
It's up to you.

357
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:50,360
Okay, thank you, Fan.

358
00:19:00,690 --> 00:19:01,730
Guan Guan, please...

359
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,040
Yes, stand up a little.

360
00:19:03,070 --> 00:19:03,590
You were blocked a bit.

361
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:07,880
Hold on. Let me check.

362
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:11,120
The morning ones came out, right?

363
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:15,380
Thank you.

364
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:16,140
We're done for today.

365
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:16,970
Let's call it a day.

366
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,240
Time to go.

367
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:19,110
Thank you, everyone.

368
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:22,480
Thank you, Guan Guan.

369
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:23,340
Let me hold it for you.

370
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:24,260
Okay.

371
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:24,900
It's okay.

372
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:26,450
Let me do it.

373
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:27,370
Mentor.

374
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:28,060
Thank you for your hard work today.

375
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,150
-The equipment... -Send the equipment back when it's ready.

376
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:34,370
I have something to tell you.

377
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,270
Look after this.

378
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:35,970
I'm going to pick the photos.

379
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:37,430
Zhuang Yan.

380
00:19:41,010 --> 00:19:41,560
Take this.

381
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:44,030
I'll treat you to dinner tonight.

382
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:48,800
Zhuang Yan.

383
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:50,540
I like you!

384
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:02,070
I said I like you, Zhuang Yan.

385
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:05,230
I'm willing to give my life to you.

386
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:07,280
I thought

387
00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:09,240
I could take good care of you.

388
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:11,660
Now I understand.

389
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:14,800
I need you more.

390
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:26,780
What nonsense are you talking about?

391
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:29,870
Don't you think before you speak?

392
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:31,270
Zhuang Yan, I'm serious.

393
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:31,850
Don't come over.

394
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:35,500
Zhuang Yan,

395
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:37,140
can you give me a chance?

396
00:20:40,170 --> 00:20:41,110
I don't understand what you're talking about.

397
00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:43,850
Zhuang Yan. Zhuang Yan!

398
00:20:44,090 --> 00:20:44,860
What?

399
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:51,100
That way.

400
00:21:04,590 --> 00:21:05,210
Work hard.

401
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:18,300
Is Zhuang troubled?

402
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:20,380
What's wrong?

403
00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:22,210
Isn't Ying busy today?

404
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:23,380
No, not really.

405
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:25,310
So I came to care about

406
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:27,190
my dearest sister.

407
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:32,520
I remember you have

408
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:34,350
a photo needing editing here in my place?

409
00:21:35,070 --> 00:21:36,220
If you're not busy,

410
00:21:36,270 --> 00:21:37,300
I'll take my time then.

411
00:21:37,330 --> 00:21:38,010
I suddenly remembered

412
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:38,910
I have an emergency

413
00:21:38,930 --> 00:21:40,220
to deal with.

414
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:42,160
I'll leave you alone then.

415
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:44,610
You don't care about your sister anymore?

416
00:21:45,950 --> 00:21:49,040
I'll melt you with my warm heart at home.

417
00:21:49,170 --> 00:21:50,460
No more words. Bye.

418
00:22:00,450 --> 00:22:01,110
Fan.

419
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:02,290
Are you thirsty?

420
00:22:04,090 --> 00:22:04,650
No.

421
00:22:06,030 --> 00:22:08,610
Are you really not thirsty?

422
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:14,300
I think I suddenly want to have a drink.

423
00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:16,240
I'll leave you to it.

424
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:17,390
I'll take it.

425
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:21,230
Yu Sicheng has confessed his love.

426
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,320
But Zhuang still doesn't take it seriously.

427
00:22:23,990 --> 00:22:24,940
Should we

428
00:22:24,970 --> 00:22:27,100
go through fire and water for our best friend's happiness?

429
00:22:27,530 --> 00:22:28,720
My dear,

430
00:22:29,010 --> 00:22:30,890
just stay put, okay?

431
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:33,590
This is only the beginning stage of a relationship.

432
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:36,550
It's painful and bitter, but kinda sweet when you savor it.

433
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:38,140
It is hard to resist or to stop.

434
00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:40,080
Don't mess it up.

435
00:22:40,610 --> 00:22:42,130
What bitter and sweet?

436
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,260
Aren't you worried?

437
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,170
I'm vexed to death.

438
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:48,400
Take care of yourself. Make a pot of jasmine tea.

439
00:22:48,430 --> 00:22:49,950
Have some purple-heart radish sesame candy

440
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:51,140
and stay put quietly.

441
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:52,820
That alone is helping your friend

442
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:54,060
pursue her happiness.

443
00:22:55,330 --> 00:22:56,680
What are you talking about?

444
00:22:56,860 --> 00:22:58,410
Can you bear to see Zhuang

445
00:22:58,550 --> 00:22:59,630
having no appetite all day

446
00:22:59,770 --> 00:23:00,450
and no sleep all night?

447
00:23:00,510 --> 00:23:02,020
Mind your own business.

448
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:05,260
Zheng Dao.

449
00:23:07,790 --> 00:23:08,390
Director.

450
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:12,440
Where is he?

451
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:15,710
Fan Jian.

452
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:18,990
Tell me.

453
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:21,510
Your mother gave you a pretty face.

454
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:22,600
Why didn't she give you

455
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:23,920
a matching EQ?

456
00:23:24,050 --> 00:23:26,170
In the end, your uncle has to worry about it

457
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:27,980
and improve your level.

458
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:31,180
Uncle,

459
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:33,900
how do you think I could win his heart?

460
00:23:35,490 --> 00:23:36,770
Look at Zhuang Yan.

461
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:40,310
She only sang a song, but she made Yu Sicheng crazy about her.

462
00:23:40,890 --> 00:23:41,420
What about you?

463
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:44,010
Zheng Dao told you to give it a try.

464
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:46,070
But you were casual like a man.

465
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:48,100
When he suggested to have a try,

466
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:49,410
you just retorted.

467
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:50,570
What else could I do?

468
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:56,140
You mean

469
00:23:56,980 --> 00:23:57,590
I should have given it a try?

470
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:58,990
I mean

471
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,880
you kiss him directly.

472
00:24:01,250 --> 00:24:02,070
Strike while the iron is hot.

473
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:03,240
Occupy his heart,

474
00:24:03,390 --> 00:24:04,320
disturb his thoughts,

475
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:05,270
and succeed in one go.

476
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:09,410
Please enlighten me, uncle.

477
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:13,960
Didn't he ask you to write the next special article?

478
00:24:14,370 --> 00:24:15,410
You just play cute with him

479
00:24:15,570 --> 00:24:16,780
and ask him to work together with you.

480
00:24:17,190 --> 00:24:18,430
If you keep doing it,

481
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:20,220
there will be a chance without doubt.

482
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:25,590
That makes sense.

483
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:27,240
I guarantee your progress will be rapid.

484
00:24:27,630 --> 00:24:28,300
No need for further chatter.

485
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:32,340
Got it.

486
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:36,910
Director,

487
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:39,240
I don't know how to write this article.

488
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:43,790
Can you have a look of it for me?

489
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:45,910
Okay.

490
00:24:56,770 --> 00:24:57,350
Well,

491
00:24:57,740 --> 00:24:58,750
it's already pretty good.

492
00:24:59,000 --> 00:24:59,720
Just keep writing like this.

493
00:25:00,310 --> 00:25:01,990
You can write a good article.

494
00:25:03,350 --> 00:25:04,470
Really?

495
00:25:04,810 --> 00:25:07,910
But I still don't understand.

496
00:25:08,170 --> 00:25:08,720
How about

497
00:25:09,190 --> 00:25:10,870
telling me some more?

498
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:13,670
Are you okay?

499
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:18,860
I'm not okay.

500
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:22,360
I dare not go there alone.

501
00:25:22,550 --> 00:25:23,320
How about

502
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:26,120
going together with me?

503
00:25:30,690 --> 00:25:31,750
I forgot to tell you.

504
00:25:32,170 --> 00:25:34,740
As for exploring the restaurants, I'll go with you all the way

505
00:25:35,330 --> 00:25:36,440
and decide which products to choose.

506
00:25:36,810 --> 00:25:38,090
That way you can write the article faster.

507
00:25:38,930 --> 00:25:39,970
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

508
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:41,440
It made me nervous.

509
00:25:45,890 --> 00:25:48,070
It made me nervous.

510
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:49,420
Alright.

511
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:50,230
I'm good now.

512
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:51,470
See you.

513
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:08,210
It's just a little failure at the beginning of the battle.

514
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,040
I will never

515
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:12,220
flinch at such a small blow.

516
00:26:12,870 --> 00:26:13,840
Didn't the ancient scholars say,

517
00:26:14,250 --> 00:26:15,050
to win a man's heart,

518
00:26:15,070 --> 00:26:16,040
you need to win his stomach first?

519
00:26:17,630 --> 00:26:18,270
I don't believe

520
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:19,980
I can't conquer him.

521
00:26:23,410 --> 00:26:23,980
Shen Ying,

522
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:25,370
who are you going to conquer?

523
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:29,170
I meant the article.

524
00:26:29,470 --> 00:26:31,320
I said I'm going to conquer this special article.

525
00:26:33,250 --> 00:26:33,660
Come on.

526
00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:34,500
You can do it.

527
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:35,380
Come on.

528
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:37,760
I can do it.

529
00:26:41,450 --> 00:26:42,580
Your drawing is quite good.

530
00:26:43,150 --> 00:26:45,470
This is the food map I made myself.

531
00:26:46,650 --> 00:26:47,610
Don't underestimate it.

532
00:26:47,830 --> 00:26:48,880
You'll see how great it is.

533
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:51,780
Good, let's start from here.

534
00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:53,400
Today,

535
00:26:53,850 --> 00:26:55,820
let me, the genius food editor,

536
00:26:56,010 --> 00:26:57,000
show you

537
00:26:57,530 --> 00:27:01,060
a taste of the mortal world.

538
00:27:01,710 --> 00:27:02,150
Let's go.

539
00:27:04,990 --> 00:27:05,590
Boss,

540
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:06,890
I want a portion of fish balls.

541
00:27:07,070 --> 00:27:08,310
A large portion. Original flavor.

542
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:11,190
Pick the chewy ones for me.

543
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:13,080
I like chewy ones. Thank you.

544
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:16,320
Thank you, boss.

545
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:19,930
Take it. You'll have nothing to say.

546
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:21,430
How much is it?

547
00:27:21,530 --> 00:27:22,000
Ten Yuan.

548
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:22,760
Okay.

549
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:25,790
Men are simple.

550
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:27,540
If he has seen all the loftiness,

551
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:29,140
take him to taste a touch of the mortal world.

552
00:27:29,810 --> 00:27:30,780
When he's in a suit,

553
00:27:31,030 --> 00:27:32,680
take him to experience the grassroots life.

554
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:34,220
Anyway,

555
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:36,270
they just want a woman

556
00:27:36,870 --> 00:27:38,490
who allows them to be a kid again.

557
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:41,380
The fish balls here are something

558
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:43,560
you must eat when you come to the university night market.

559
00:27:43,890 --> 00:27:44,720
If you don't eat this,

560
00:27:44,890 --> 00:27:45,630
you've come here in vain.

561
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:49,430
Hot!

562
00:27:50,270 --> 00:27:50,740
Yummy.

563
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:51,570
Slow down.

564
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:56,180
Don't worry.

565
00:27:57,130 --> 00:27:57,700
They're all yours.

566
00:28:11,550 --> 00:28:12,060
Next stop,

567
00:28:12,170 --> 00:28:13,490
I'm going to take you to this place

568
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:15,370
that sells great roasted ribs.

569
00:28:16,450 --> 00:28:16,780
Okay.

570
00:28:24,490 --> 00:28:29,220
Roasted ribs. Roasted ribs.

571
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:34,720
Right over there.

572
00:28:35,350 --> 00:28:35,720
Let's go.

573
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:38,600
Excuse me,

574
00:28:38,630 --> 00:28:39,690
here are the roasted ribs that you ordered.

575
00:28:39,870 --> 00:28:40,460
Enjoy.

576
00:28:40,490 --> 00:28:40,800
Thank you.

577
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:41,420
Thank you, boss.

578
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:43,610
Eat up.

579
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:45,330
The ribs here are really delicious.

580
00:28:45,630 --> 00:28:46,690
After I first had them,

581
00:28:46,870 --> 00:28:48,310
I kept thinking about them for three whole days!

582
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:48,790
Really?

583
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:55,380
Look at you.

584
00:28:55,420 --> 00:28:56,410
You look like you've been starving for three years.

585
00:28:59,320 --> 00:28:59,950
Director Zheng,

586
00:29:00,490 --> 00:29:01,840
you don't usually eat alone, do you?

587
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,250
When you eat alone,

588
00:29:03,530 --> 00:29:06,010
you have to show all your passion,

589
00:29:06,530 --> 00:29:08,740
so that people around you can feel it too.

590
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:10,130
Really?

591
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:11,890
You can have my portion too.

592
00:29:12,190 --> 00:29:13,550
Don't give it to me. Eat.

593
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:14,340
It's really good.

594
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:15,880
I don't think it suits my taste.

595
00:29:16,350 --> 00:29:17,450
Why not?

596
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:18,670
You haven't even tried it. Try it.

597
00:29:18,770 --> 00:29:20,010
Based on my years of experience,

598
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:20,830
it really doesn't suit me.

599
00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:23,260
Fine.

600
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:24,810
I'll eat it for you.

601
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:29,960
Here.
