Ying,

4
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:41,930
is this warm soup good?

5
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:43,340
It’s good.

6
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:45,789
By the way, Bai,

7
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:47,460
you must know

8
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:49,440
which chef made it, right?

9
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,200
Must be the one

10
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:53,780
who likes you, of course.

11
00:01:58,009 --> 00:01:58,640
Who is it?

12
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:01,170
It's...

13
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:03,580
What does a little girl know

14
00:02:03,610 --> 00:02:05,010
about "liking"?

15
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:05,940
Right?

16
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:07,700
Come on, let's have a drink.

17
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:10,139
Shen Ying, go on with your soup.

18
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:39,770
Don't worry.

19
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:40,890
I got the gift.

20
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:45,190
Thank you, my cutest Chubby.

21
00:02:46,329 --> 00:02:46,660
Okay.

22
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:48,300
Bye.

23
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,460
There's something going on.

24
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:55,660
Of course.

Ying's childhood sweetheart

sends his gift every year without fail.

27
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:01,340
Yes,

28
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:02,700
he sends his gift.

29
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:03,590
But no presence at all

30
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:04,810
since he went abroad.

31
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:07,070
At least it's a token of his good wishes.

32
00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:09,910
Someone's being a little sour.

33
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:14,660
But Zhuang,

34
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:16,490
compared with me,

35
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:18,380
don't you have something bigger going on?

36
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,320
What are you talking about?

37
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:23,380
No red herrings, okay?

38
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:25,280
Seriously though, Zhuang,

39
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,040
as this laddie has been

40
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:28,000
persevering for so long,

41
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:30,220
why don't you just give in?

42
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,630
He looks kind of pitiful.

43
00:03:35,079 --> 00:03:35,920
Why are you two

44
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,440
making a fuss too?

45
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:38,420
Can't you see

46
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:39,260
it's just a kid

47
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:40,060
playing around?

48
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:41,670
He's not serious.

49
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:48,900
Why are you coughing?

50
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:49,970
I'm fine.

51
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:51,170
Just a slight cold.

52
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:53,240
Let's swap the hot pot for something else tonight.

53
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:54,850
No way!

54

hot pot on my birthday.

Send Shen Ying an invitation tonight.

69

Tell her that Restaurant Si is offering free hot pot for once

to celebrate its customer's birthday.

Restaurant Si offering hot pot?

72

Did I hear you right?

73

Are you going to cook the base flavoring?

No.

81

I'm only getting the ingredients ready.

82

Chef Dong will cook it for me.

You're in love.

You are in love.

why did you worry about the article

107

when you had such connections at Si?

108

Seems fishy.

109
00:06:31,810 --> 00:06:33,740
Does the boss have a thing for you?

Mr. Fang is just being kind.

111

Then it must be the chef.

112

Or why would they offer

exactly your favorite dish?

114
00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:46,700
I don't even know who it is.

115

Nor do I know him personally.

174
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:18,820
Yes.

175
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:20,540
Buddies since childhood.

176
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:22,260
Let me introduce him properly.

177
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:22,900
This...

178
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:25,140
is my little brother from another mother.

179
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:27,070
You can tell them

180
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:27,940
how I saved you

181
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:28,740
when we were little.

182
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:29,480
I don't mind.

183
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:30,860
Alright, no need to introduce.

184
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:32,450
We know you grew up together now.

185
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,480
You can save the introduction.

186
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:34,420
Alright.

187
00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:35,660
Blow out the candles.

188
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:36,420
Okay.

189
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:51,300
Hello, everyone.

190
00:09:51,370 --> 00:09:52,100
I'm Ye Zhiqiu.

191
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:54,540
I'm honored to join you

192
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:56,580
in celebrating Shen Ying's 27th birthday.

193
00:09:57,220 --> 00:09:57,980
I'd like to wish Shen Ying

194
00:09:58,930 --> 00:10:00,780
a most loving relationship

195
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:02,700
in this new year of your life.

196

Alright.

197

Sit down and eat.

198
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:07,260
Come on latecomer, take a seat.

199
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:08,140
Sit down.

200
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:11,330
This is delicious. Try it.

201
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:12,500
Isn't it?

202
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:14,430
It's alright.

203
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:15,380

205
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:17,500
Thanks but...

206
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:18,250
-How's it going? -My plate's full.

207
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:18,940
What do you mean?

208
00:10:21,010 --> 00:10:22,740
How do they like my hot pot?

209
00:10:24,410 --> 00:10:26,240
How do they like my hot pot?

210
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:28,100
It reminds me...

211
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:31,050
If you don't show up soon,

212
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:33,810
Shen Ying is going to be spoken for.

213
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:38,140
Well...

214
00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:40,380
I'm gonna use the bathroom.

215
00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:42,060
Go ahead.

216
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:43,760
Be quick.

217
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:51,500
Hey guys.

218
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:54,420
-Miranda. -Miranda.

219
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:56,260
Happy birthday, Shen Ying.

220
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:57,700
Thank you.

221
00:10:58,570 --> 00:10:59,400
Really appreciate it.

222
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:02,270
Let me.

223
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:03,460
Didn't you say

224
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:04,660
you had a business meeting

225
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:05,820
about "everyday desserts"

226
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:06,660
and couldn't make it?

227
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:08,660
It's true.

228
00:11:09,130 --> 00:11:11,380
-Put it there. -The person I'm meeting

229
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:12,620
is right here.

230
00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:15,850
Let me introduce to you.

231
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:17,300
This gentleman next to Shen Ying

232
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:19,010
is the dessert chef

233
00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:20,350
who will be collaborating with us.

234
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:21,870
Mr. Ye Zhiqiu.

235
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:24,130
He's studied in Italy

236
00:11:24,530 --> 00:11:26,460
and won many international awards.

237
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:27,980
One of the most promising

238
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:29,660
young dessert chefs of today.

239
00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:30,740
Zhiqiu,

240
00:11:31,210 --> 00:11:32,460
welcome in advance.

241
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:33,180
Thank you.

242
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:36,420
I'll soon be

243
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:37,730
kind of an Isen employee.

244
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:39,260
I will appreciate your help.

245
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:41,090
-Sure. -Zhiqiu told me

246
00:11:41,290 --> 00:11:42,440
he’s a good friend of yours.

247
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:43,500
So we decided to

248
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:44,820
have our meeting here.

249
00:11:45,130 --> 00:11:47,370
Which made it possible for me to come to your birthday party.

250
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:48,420
Director Zheng.

251
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:52,100
Director, you've finished work?

252
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:53,420
Not yet.

253
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,040
I'm just dropping by to ask...

254
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:56,140
Zhuang Yan,

255
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:57,810
that material I was asking for, have you...

256
00:11:57,970 --> 00:11:59,050
Material?

257
00:11:59,770 --> 00:12:00,180
Material.

258
00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:06,520
M-M...

259
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:11,660
Material?

260
00:12:11,770 --> 00:12:13,300
If it's not ready yet,

261
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:14,620
you can give it to me tomorrow.

262
00:12:15,050 --> 00:12:15,860
Now if you'll excuse me...

263
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:16,460
Director Zheng.

264
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:18,620
Since you've come,

265
00:12:18,930 --> 00:12:19,770
join us and have something.

266
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:20,980
Yeah,

267
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:21,650
have a seat.

268
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:22,800
Welcome to my birthday party.

269
00:12:22,830 --> 00:12:23,300
Come on.

270
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:24,370
Come on.

271
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:25,310
Come on.

272
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:25,700
-Come on. -Okay.

273
00:12:30,810 --> 00:12:31,570
And this is...

274
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:33,850
-He's... -Hi, I'm Ye Zhiqiu.

275
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:35,800
We grew up together.

276
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:37,500
Nice to meet you.

277
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:40,220
I'm her superior,

278
00:12:40,450 --> 00:12:40,980
Zheng Dao.

279
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:41,580
Nice to meet you.

280
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:42,580
I've heard a lot about you.

281
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:44,570
Director Zheng is quite famous

282
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:45,610
in the restaurant industry.

283
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:46,610
If possible,

284
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,810
I'd like to seek your advice.

285
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:50,290
You're too kind.

286
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:53,060
I don't really care about what other people think of me.

287
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:55,020
Right,

288
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:56,300
enough with the civilities.

289
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:56,770
Eat.

290
00:12:57,220 --> 00:12:58,570
Come on.

291
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:04,820
Shen Ying,

292
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:06,900
maybe you should go easy on these spicy things

293
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:07,820
with your sore throat.

294
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:09,580
But I haven't had hot pot for so long.

295
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:10,180
I can't help it.

296
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:11,140
Besides,

297
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:12,580
how can I resist this limited-edition

298
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:13,620
Si-exclusive hot pot?

299
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:16,340
You must really love this place.

300
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:18,740
I absolutely love it.

301
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:19,460
Trust me,

302
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:21,060
the chef here is really good at cooking.

303
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:21,770
Give it a try yourself.

304
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:24,090
Indeed.

305
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:25,700
This place has got a good reputation.

306
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:27,140
And you can tell

307
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:28,930
that the chef really spares no effort.

308
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:31,770
Eat up.

309
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:33,530
Director, you seem to be in a good humor.

310
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:34,860
Yeah?

311
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:36,460
As usual.

312
00:13:37,330 --> 00:13:37,780
As usual.

313
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:39,260
Have some more.

314
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:39,540
Okay.

315
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:40,340
It's really good.

316
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:48,160
Actually,

317
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:50,620
you can't really rinse off the greasiness with water.

318
00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:52,400
Adding in some mint

319
00:13:53,010 --> 00:13:53,650
will reduce the spiciness,

320
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:55,660
and is good for your throat.

321
00:13:57,170 --> 00:13:58,050
Thank you, Director.

322
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,460
It's great to be young.

323
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:05,580
Director Zheng,

324
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:07,100
we share our responsibilities at work,

325
00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:08,500
sometimes, inevitably,

326
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:09,460
we stick to our own opinions.

327
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,440
The Gourmet column is doing very well.

328
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:13,950
You've proven your ability

329
00:14:14,330 --> 00:14:15,460
to all of us.

330
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:17,250
As for Shen Ying,

331
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:19,820
she's the best apprentice I've had.

332
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:22,020
I'm sure she'll progress even faster

333
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:23,100
under your guidance.

334
00:14:24,210 --> 00:14:24,540
Thank you.

335
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:25,940
I'll do my best, Miranda.

336
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:28,580
Thank you.

337
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:37,400
What am I doing?

338
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:38,930
Thrusting myself on a pair

339
00:14:38,930 --> 00:14:40,660
that used to be childhood sweethearts.

340
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:42,260
This is crazy.

341
00:15:03,810 --> 00:15:04,360
Shen Ying?

342
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:05,500
What are you doing here?

343
00:15:05,830 --> 00:15:06,790
Director Zheng?

344
00:15:07,170 --> 00:15:08,950
Why are you in the ladies' room?

345
00:15:10,090 --> 00:15:10,940
This is the men's room.

346
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:11,660
Are you drunk?

347
00:15:11,930 --> 00:15:13,020
-Let's get out of here. -I'm not drunk.

348
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:15,100
Careful!

349
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:28,500
Shen Ying.

350
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:31,620
Are you okay?

351
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:34,480
Um...

352
00:15:35,130 --> 00:15:36,450
Fan Jian and Zhuang Yan have left.

353
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:39,060
I will see you home.

354
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:43,420
Shen Ying,

355
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:45,100
let me know if you need anything.

356
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:45,690
I'll be at the door.

357
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:54,110
Thank you.

358
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:56,100
Why did you drink so much again?

359
00:15:56,420 --> 00:15:57,290
That was entirely

360
00:15:57,310 --> 00:15:57,980
unnecessary.

361
00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:02,890
You keep laughing at me anyway.

362
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:04,220
Alright,

363
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:04,940
let me see you home.

364
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:05,260
No.

365
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:08,740
You'll probably take me to a hotel

366
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:10,260
and do things to me again.

367
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:10,660
What?

368
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:12,250
What did I do to you?

369
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:13,060
That video can prove

370
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:13,820
I didn't do anything...

371
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:14,260
So you...

372
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:20,000
Don't mention that video anymore.

373
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:22,840
And...

374
00:16:23,610 --> 00:16:24,570
Director Zheng,

375
00:16:26,010 --> 00:16:30,050
am I really that unattractive?

376
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:40,210
Shen Ying,

377
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:41,380
let's get out of

378
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,160
this men's room first.

379
00:16:52,350 --> 00:16:52,740
This way.

380
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:56,560
You're...

381
00:16:58,290 --> 00:16:58,860
What's...

382
00:16:59,170 --> 00:17:00,110
Chubby?

383
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:02,020
She got drunk and went in there.

384
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:02,890
I'll see her home now.

385
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:04,369
I'll do that.

386
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:07,089
Not very appropriate for a stranger to see her home.

387
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:14,099
I'm not drunk.

388
00:17:15,109 --> 00:17:15,900
-I'll just... -Let's go.

389
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:18,750
Wait...

390
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:28,900
Careful.

391
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:30,660
I'm fine.

392
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:32,260
I'm fine, really.

393
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:33,020
You sure?

394
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:33,980
Come on, let's get you home.

395
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:34,420
Come on.

396
00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:36,860
Be careful.

397
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:37,940
Let's get you home.

398
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:39,580
Listen, Chubby,

399
00:17:40,570 --> 00:17:42,290
I'm not drunk.

400
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:43,510
Okay.

401
00:17:43,810 --> 00:17:44,490
Get in the car.

402
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:04,010
Follow that car.

403
00:18:04,050 --> 00:18:04,340
Okay.

404
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:18,260
Here.

405
00:18:19,550 --> 00:18:19,870
Careful.

406
00:18:21,450 --> 00:18:21,920
Be careful.

407
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:28,580
Ying.

408
00:18:29,050 --> 00:18:29,860
You're back.

409
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:31,170
Are you okay?

410
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:33,090
Who are you?

411
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:35,740
Home come you look so much like

412
00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:38,270
my scumbag fiancé?

413
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:42,970
It's really you.

414
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:45,380
Ying.

415
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:46,900
How dare you come to see me again!

416
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:48,300
You want me to

417
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:49,900
tell that wife of yours?

418
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:52,700
Ying!

419
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:53,220
Let go!

420
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:54,140
Just forget about her.

421
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:55,100
She's a liar.

422
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:55,860
She was lying.

423
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:57,500
She was not pregnant.

424
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:58,060
Sir.

425
00:18:58,060 --> 00:18:59,220
-I've finally realized... -Please drop me there.

426
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:00,060
It's you that I love.

427
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:01,340
Let's get married.

428
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:02,640
Let's start over, okay?

429
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:03,460
Let go of me!

430
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:03,820
Let go!

431
00:19:06,450 --> 00:19:07,730
You're that guy, right?

432
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:10,140
You dumped Ying

433
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:11,060
at the engagement party,

434
00:19:11,130 --> 00:19:11,940
and left with another woman.

435
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:15,760
And who is this guy?

436
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,010
He's not the one I saw last time.

437
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:20,100
What guy?

438
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:21,850
I don't feel like exaplaining.

439
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:23,920
Listen.

440
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:26,010
Get lost now.

441
00:19:26,770 --> 00:19:28,090
I don't want to see you again.

442
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:30,500
Got yourself yet another guy?

443
00:19:31,730 --> 00:19:33,020
I came here today

444
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:34,300
hoping to make up with you.

445
00:19:35,370 --> 00:19:36,650
Turns out I was wrong about you.

446
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:39,060
Listen.

447
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:40,700
Listen up.

448
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:41,780
If you dare

449
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:43,290
harass Shen Ying again,

450
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:45,140
I won't let you get away with it.

451
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:49,770
Listen,

452
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:50,740
Liu Yu,

453
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:55,220
I'm not someone unwanted or unloved.

454
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:58,220
Any of the men around me is better than you.

455
00:19:58,260 --> 00:19:59,490
You hear me?

456
00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:01,870
Now, if you do,

457
00:20:02,010 --> 00:20:03,450
get out of here!

458
00:20:05,910 --> 00:20:06,630
Listen,

459
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:09,060
don't get cocky too soon.

460
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:09,930
This woman

461
00:20:10,370 --> 00:20:11,940
is going to cuckold you sooner or later.

462
00:20:18,410 --> 00:20:18,930
Are you okay?

463
00:20:19,970 --> 00:20:20,290
Here.

464
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:34,100
Sir, let's go.

465
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:34,880
Back to where I was.

466
00:20:36,990 --> 00:20:37,900
Honestly, though,

467
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:39,310
you did say quite some silly stuff

468
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:41,700
just to piss him off.

469
00:20:47,930 --> 00:20:49,150
I'm sorry, Chubby.

470
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:52,730
I made a fool of myself.

471
00:20:54,070 --> 00:20:54,600
If all else fails,

472
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:58,090
we could make do with each other.

473
00:20:58,600 --> 00:20:59,200
Stop.

474
00:21:00,470 --> 00:21:01,100
Chubby,

475
00:21:02,690 --> 00:21:05,600
you're the best buddy I've ever had.

476
00:21:07,450 --> 00:21:08,660
I'm safely home now.

477
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:09,890
Just go.

478
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:11,080
I'm fine.

479
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:47,660
Xinyi,

480
00:21:48,430 --> 00:21:49,250
tell me now,

481
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:51,720
do you ever

482
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:54,140
have this tight feeling

483
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:55,260
in your chest?

484
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:00,020
It's like when...

485
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:01,860
the food you want

486
00:22:02,010 --> 00:22:02,970
is hogged by some other cat.

487
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:05,220
Would you feel sad?

488
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:07,290
What?

489
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:08,700
Beat that cat?

490
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:09,810
No.

491
00:22:10,190 --> 00:22:10,990
Be a good girl

492
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:12,430
and don't fight with other kids.

493
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:13,140
Okay?

494
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:22,060
Shen Ying.

495
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:23,740
Give us the numbers.

496
00:22:24,570 --> 00:22:26,140
How many cars does Ye Zhiqiu own?

497
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:28,090
How many houses, family members and acres?

498
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:28,820
Tell us!

499
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:30,170
Of course.

500
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:31,620
Of course I know these things.

501
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:33,460
I even know how many puppies

502
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:34,340
his dog has had.

503
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:35,480
Are you satisfied?

504
00:22:36,290 --> 00:22:36,780
Yes.

505
00:22:37,390 --> 00:22:38,230
So you know him well.

506
00:22:39,210 --> 00:22:40,400
A perfect match.

507
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:44,580
Oh my god.

508
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:46,090
What are you thinking about?

509
00:22:46,130 --> 00:22:47,770
I was feeling dizzy already.

510
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:49,690
Why aren't you serving me honey water

511
00:22:49,710 --> 00:22:50,590
to help me sober up.

512
00:22:51,090 --> 00:22:52,000
Now is not the time

513
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:53,870
for you to change the subject.

514
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:55,110
After all,

515
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:56,890
this guy may well become

516
00:22:56,890 --> 00:22:58,510
your boyfriend in the future.

517
00:22:58,540 --> 00:23:01,300
We have to make stringent checks on him.

518
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:02,420
Stringent checks.

519
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:07,140
Guys,

520
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:08,820
Ye Zhiqiu is just someone

521
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:09,460
for whom

522
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:11,180
I took up the cudgels when I was little.

523
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:12,340
That's why

524
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:13,740
he's being super-duper nice to me.

525
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:15,340
Stop your uninvited matchmaking,

526
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:15,860
okay?

527
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:17,490
"Super-duper"?

528
00:23:17,690 --> 00:23:19,720
"Nice"?

529
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:21,580
-Sounds good! -Sounds good!

530
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:25,620
I'm his knight in shining armor!

531
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:27,620
How am I his girlfriend to you?

532
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:30,250
Say what you will,

533
00:23:30,270 --> 00:23:31,000
but let me tell you,

534
00:23:31,330 --> 00:23:33,520
it's the deeds, not the words,

535
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:35,240
that really count.

536
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:36,350
The way I see it,

537
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:38,620
the way Ye Zhiqiu acts around you

538
00:23:38,730 --> 00:23:41,970
is not much different from how a boyfriend would behave.

539
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:43,730
That's right.

540
00:23:47,310 --> 00:23:48,490
My dear pals,

541
00:23:48,990 --> 00:23:50,470
there's a huge difference

542
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:52,660
between a friend and a boyfriend, okay?

543
00:23:55,890 --> 00:23:57,200
As your uncle,

544
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:58,810
I must have you understand this.

545
00:23:59,510 --> 00:24:01,830
Turning a friend into a boyfriend...

546
00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:04,620
is much easier than you think.

547
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:06,050
What are you trying to say?

548
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:08,020
Zhuang,

549
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:10,160
I want some water.

550
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:11,170
Fine.

551
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:11,960
I'll get it for you.

552
00:24:18,170 --> 00:24:19,970
Mr. Yu is the most important advertiser to Isen.

553
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:21,860
There are many dessert shops

554
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:22,840
within Shengshi Group.

555
00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:24,580
There're possibilities of future cooperation.

556
00:24:25,570 --> 00:24:27,290
Thirty Degrees South Latitude is famous in the industry.

557
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:28,460
I look forward to it.

558
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:40,260
Mr. Yu.

559
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:40,940
Ms. Lin.

560
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:42,100
Hello.

561
00:24:42,870 --> 00:24:44,670
This is Isen's new dessert chef,

562
00:24:44,930 --> 00:24:45,820
Ye Zhiqiu.

563
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:46,940
Hello, Mr. Yu.

564
00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:47,660
Nice to meet you.

565
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:48,270
Nice to meet you.

566
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:50,560
I heard that Mr. Ye

567
00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:52,420
came back from Italy.

568
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:53,740
A promising

569
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:57,180
young talent in the industry.

570
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,300
It's a great honor

571
00:24:58,300 --> 00:24:59,100
to be introduced

572
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,000
to the owner of Thirty Degrees South Latitude.

573
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:02,810
Oh,

574
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:04,100
please come in.

575
00:25:05,730 --> 00:25:06,860
This way please.

576
00:25:12,250 --> 00:25:12,660
Please have a seat.

577
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:18,860
Ms. Lin,

578
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:19,780
thank you.

579
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:21,930
Thank you very much indeed.

580
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:25,220
For introducing such an excellent talent to me.

581
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:28,980
There're long-standing ties between Isen and Shengshi.

582
00:25:29,710 --> 00:25:30,680
It's only natural, Mr. Yu.

583
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:34,470
Mr. Ye,

584
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:35,810
in my opinion,

585
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:39,020
we should work more closely in the future.

586
00:25:40,130 --> 00:25:40,940
With Isen's help,

587
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,190
we'll win the entire greater China market.

588
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:44,110
Sure, Mr. Yu.

589
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:46,790
I'm quite interested in the Gourmet column

590
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:47,970
launched lately by Thirty Degrees South Latitude.

591
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:50,780
It's indeed a good project.

592
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:52,660
But...

593
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:55,060
No buts.

594
00:25:56,350 --> 00:25:57,360
Yeah, of course.

595
00:25:58,100 --> 00:25:59,740
I believe you've heard of

596
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:01,250
our newly appointed director.

597
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:03,180
Director Zheng is in charge of

598
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,310
the New Media Department.

599
00:26:04,770 --> 00:26:05,940
He communicates directly with the headquarters.

600
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:08,540
Our proposal may fail to get the green light.

601
00:26:11,150 --> 00:26:11,940
Ms. Lin,

602
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:14,890
we're determined to win

603
00:26:15,510 --> 00:26:16,960
the greater China market.

604
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:18,690
Therefore, I'd say that

605
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:19,820
the proposal

606
00:26:20,430 --> 00:26:22,060
will have to get the green light.

607
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:22,820
What do you say?

608
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:24,940
Thank you, Mr. Yu.

609
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:28,820
It's nothing.

610
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:30,820
Mr. Ye,

611
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:33,660
I hope we'll have a pleasant cooperation.

612
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:34,700
Me too.

613
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:40,200
Let me introduce to you,

614
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:41,810
the dessert chef

615
00:26:41,810 --> 00:26:43,860
of renown and will be collaborating with Isen,

616
00:26:44,450 --> 00:26:45,410
Mr. Ye Zhiqiu.

617
00:26:50,250 --> 00:26:50,780
Hello, everyone.

618
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:51,740
I’m Ye Zhiqiu.

619
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:54,420
Hope we'll all enjoy working together.

620
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:00,730
Zhiqiu will also

621
00:27:00,850 --> 00:27:03,130
participate in Shengshi Group's dessert designing process,

622
00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:04,490
collaborating with Shengshi's

623
00:27:04,630 --> 00:27:06,950
most prominent dessert shop, Thirty Degrees South Latitude.

624
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:08,210
And Isen

625
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:09,480
will be in charge of publicity.

626
00:27:09,830 --> 00:27:11,220
So the Gourmet column will report on it

627
00:27:11,390 --> 00:27:12,020
in the next issue.

628
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:13,860
I'd like to hear your ideas

629
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:15,180
if you've got any.

630
00:27:15,610 --> 00:27:16,380
I have an idea.

631
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:19,430
We can invite celebrities to collaborate with Mr. Ye,

632
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:21,790
so that our desserts will be instant success.

633
00:27:22,130 --> 00:27:22,860
What do you think, Zhiqiu?

634
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:24,740
I'd love to do any kind of collaboration,

635
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:25,980
as long as it works.

636
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:27,010
Of course it will.

637
00:27:27,530 --> 00:27:28,680
Celebrity endorsements

638
00:27:28,890 --> 00:27:30,820
will certainly help us achieve greater success.

639
00:27:32,010 --> 00:27:32,580
Objection.

640
00:27:33,470 --> 00:27:34,710
Before we get to celebrity endorsements,

641
00:27:35,410 --> 00:27:36,180
sending in the proposal

642
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:37,540
without having done any field research

643
00:27:37,710 --> 00:27:38,440
is not in compliance

644
00:27:38,970 --> 00:27:39,610
with the standard procedure.

645
00:27:39,850 --> 00:27:40,900
It's urgent.

646
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,280
We can leave the standard procedure aside

647
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:43,410
for the moment.

648
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:45,380
If Thirty Degrees South Latitude and Mr. Ye

649
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:46,610
are both so excellent,

650
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:48,100
there's no rush.

651
00:27:48,570 --> 00:27:49,880
I don't think it's advisable to start the collaboration

652
00:27:50,230 --> 00:27:50,660
in this way.

653
00:27:52,210 --> 00:27:52,780
I agree.

654
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:54,720
For the next issue,

655
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:55,560
Director Zheng and I have been

656
00:27:55,580 --> 00:27:57,220
researching on a street stall project.

657
00:27:57,750 --> 00:27:59,430
If we're really changing it to Thirty Degrees South Latitude,

658
00:27:59,490 --> 00:28:00,780
I think we still need to

659
00:28:00,810 --> 00:28:01,380
research first.

660
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:02,770
I agree.

661
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:04,780
I don't think we should overthrow our standards

662
00:28:05,130 --> 00:28:06,970
only to cater to a collaborator's will.

663
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:09,580
We must stand firm.

664
00:28:10,090 --> 00:28:10,820
I agree.

665
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:12,900
We've been working on the street stall project

666
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:14,290
for quite a few days.

667
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:16,040
We're almost done.

668
00:28:21,270 --> 00:28:21,980
How about this?

669
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:23,420
You have three more days

670
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:25,240
to work on these two proposals

671
00:28:25,910 --> 00:28:26,970
before you present them,

672
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:28,220
and then we'll take a vote.
