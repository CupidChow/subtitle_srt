00:01:36,259 --> 00:01:37,810
Ms. Ma, 5.6.

5
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:42,450
Okay.

6
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:43,820
The judges have all given their scores,

7
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:45,140
and the final score

8
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:47,530
of Restaurant Si is 6.355.

9
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:49,229
It has now fallen off the top ten list,

10
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:51,880
and might fail to be one of the top ten restaurants.

11
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:06,330
Mr. Zheng Dao,

12
00:02:06,610 --> 00:02:07,780
after the selection process,

13
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:09,610
you attended the Golden Fritillaria Competition today

14
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:11,470
and met your ex-girlfriend and your rumored girlfriend

15
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:12,780
on the same stage.

16
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:14,100
Would you like to make some remarks on that?

17
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:15,110
Mr. Zheng Dao,

18
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:17,460
your rumored girlfriend and your ex cheated together

19
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:18,500
and gave you high scores.

20
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,040
Do you have any thoughts on that?

21
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:21,350
Mr. Zheng,

22
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:22,470
your ex and current girlfriends

23
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:23,410
both gave you high scores.

24
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:24,410
Were there personal emotions involved?

25
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:24,920
Excuse me,

26
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:26,340
questions on my works only.

27
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:27,070
Thank you.

28
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:28,250
That's right.

29
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,470
Mr. Zheng, may I ask you

30
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:30,390
one last question?

31
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:32,020
I'm sorry, but...

32
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:34,260
What's your response to your plagiarism scandal

33
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:35,140
at Bocuse d'Or?

34
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:37,350
Everyone,

35
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:39,660
I want to take this opportunity

36
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:42,260
to clarify the misunderstandings from the past.

37
00:02:46,990 --> 00:02:47,720
That scandal

38
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:49,660
about Zheng Dao's plagiarism

39
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,890
at Bocuse d'Or a few years ago

40
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:52,510
is fake.

41
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:54,950
But all major newspapers covered it.

42
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:56,140
They did.

43
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:58,140
But that dish named Feizi

44
00:02:58,500 --> 00:02:59,700
was indeed created by Zheng Dao.

45
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:02,250
I was eager to get my degree,

46
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:04,200
so I took that birthday gift

47
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:06,270
and made it public in advance.

48
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:13,840
I was young,

49
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:15,610
and too eager for quick success.

50
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:17,850
Looking back,

51
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:19,170
I regret it very much.

52
00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:22,050
I lost my boyfriend,

53
00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:24,490
and almost lost

54
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:26,940
my original aspirations with which I entered the food industry.

55
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:33,510
I've contacted the magazines involved.

56
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:34,700
They will correct the attribution

57
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:36,620
and make a statement about it

58
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:38,300
in their latest issue.

59
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:42,660
Ms. Han, do you admit

60
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:44,030
that you committed academic fraud?

61
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:47,290
I'll do my best to take

62
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:48,740
any consequences that may arise.

63
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:52,210
From now on,

64
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:53,460
please pay more attention

65
00:03:53,490 --> 00:03:54,760
to Mr. Zheng Dao's future works,

66
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:56,730
and give me a chance to atone for my sins.

67
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:57,850
Have you ever wondered about

68
00:03:57,870 --> 00:03:59,620
Mr. Zheng Dao's thoughts upon the scandal?

69
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:01,260
I'm speechless.

70
00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:03,460
Why?

71
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:05,620
Shengshi Group must be behind this.

72
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:08,660
Sicheng,

73
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:09,850
that's not what I meant.

74
00:04:10,210 --> 00:04:10,660
I'm sorry.

75
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:11,800
Fan Jian is right.

76
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:15,030
My dad did bribe the judges.

77
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,399
How do you know?

78
00:04:20,029 --> 00:04:22,390
I'd met the journalist who asked Director Zheng questions before.

79
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:24,570
He's from Shengshi Group.

80
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:27,380
I feel really guilty.

81
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:28,340
I'll just...

82
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:31,090
Sit down now.

83
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:32,260
Sit down.

84
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:35,300
Don't be childish.

85
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:37,110
You've spent so much time with us.

86
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:39,180
Don't you know us well enough?

87
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,340
To us,

88
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:42,710
whatever they do,

89
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:43,420
you are you.

90
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:44,820
You did nothing wrong.

91
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:50,540
Think about it, though.

92
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:53,090
Only Shen Ying and Han Feizi

93
00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:54,560
gave some high scores.

94
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:58,350
So Yu Sheng's power can't be underestimated.

95
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:00,160
He did try to contact Han Feizi.

96
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:01,180
And he asked me through Miranda

97
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:02,420
to give a low score to Si.

98
00:05:04,450 --> 00:05:06,700
He even made the offer of the deputy editor position

99
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:07,460
in exchange for that.

100
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:09,140
In other words,

101
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:11,360
you firmly rejected him.

102
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:12,580
What else could it be?

103
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:13,820
When have I ever been someone

104
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:14,860
who'd trade integrity for profits?

105
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:17,490
But...

106
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:19,230
what Han Feizi did this time

107
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:22,020
really impressed me.

108
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:24,540
Everyone,

109
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:26,930
I think, ultimately, this incident

110
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:29,220
happened because of Si.

111
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:30,380
Perhaps

112
00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:32,770
it won't be such a bad thing for Si to be taken over,

113
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:33,350
right?

114
00:05:34,670 --> 00:05:35,260
Fang,

115
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:36,400
it's not over yet.

116
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:38,800
Isen will do an exclusive interview for the Golden Fritillaria Competition.

117
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:41,340
I recommended Si as the interviewee.

118
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:43,080
Han Feizi will be there too.

119
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:45,940
Why is Han Feizi involved?

120
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,470
Because I got to know Zheng Dao relatively late.

121
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:53,100
I don't know much about your cooking in the past.

122
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:55,220
So I thought,

123
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,440
if I were to do this alone,

124
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:58,420
I wouldn't be able to do it well

125
00:05:58,420 --> 00:05:59,300
within such a short

126
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:00,100
period of time.

127
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:01,660
So I invited her.

128
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:06,020
Xinyi,

129
00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:10,240
am I being too fussy？

130
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:12,700
Or is it because of my pride?

131
00:06:15,410 --> 00:06:16,020
What if

132
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:18,280
Shen Ying learns about what happened between us,

133
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:19,700
and starts to overthink?

134
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:27,140
Shen Ying,

135
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:29,140
do you want to know

136
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:30,770
what I've been through?

137
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,090
I'm not curious about the things which

138
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:39,190
won't change anything.

139
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:46,300
10 a.m. tomorrow.

140
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:47,280
Conference room.

141
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:49,740
Please dress up nicely.

142
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:50,930
Love you.

143
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:03,940
Morning, Director.

144
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:04,520
Shen Ying.

145
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:05,730
Are you alone?

146
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:11,900
Why?

147
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:13,600
Has Director Zheng missed me?

148
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:16,860
Our interview today

149
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:19,930
is the perfect opportunity for restoring the reputation

150
00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:21,370
of Si, Isen and Zheng Dao.

151
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:22,830
Don't miss it.

152
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:24,540
Besides,

153
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:26,300
why did Yu Sheng make Si his target?

154
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:27,990
That's because

155
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:29,660
Director Zheng is too excellent.

156
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:31,020
Yu Sheng couldn't beat him.

157
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:32,940
So he had to use such dirty tricks.

158
00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:34,900
We'll work together to make him fail.

159
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:39,600
I...

160
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,270
I need to make a call.

161
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:50,940
The dish "Feizi"

162
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:53,180
was named after me.

163
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:55,940
I have nothing to do with Mr. Zheng Dao.

164
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:57,240
I wonder why

165
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:59,020
you feel this dizziness when you cook.

166
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:02,640
Xu Duo said

167
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:04,460
it's because you feel insecure.

168
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:07,340
If I hold you

169
00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:09,650
whenever you cook,

170
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:11,830
will you feel secure?

171
00:08:33,730 --> 00:08:34,220
I'm in.

172
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:44,059
Real or fake chef...

173
00:08:44,059 --> 00:08:44,740
We're here to try...

174
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:46,780
The controversial chef from Restaurant Si...

175
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:48,130
Guys, I'm here to see my idol!

176
00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:49,300
Restaurant Si...

177
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:50,450
The media are competing for scoops...

178
00:08:50,450 --> 00:08:52,260
Introduced how Restaurant Si was founded...

179
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:54,260
Chef Zheng Dao's experience and achievements...

180
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:56,460
The look of the chef also matters when you pay for your meal...

181
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:57,420
To me,

182
00:08:57,770 --> 00:08:59,760
Mr. Zheng really is

183
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:01,600
an excellent person of ability.

184
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:05,650
I'm very lucky to be with him.

185
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:07,450
He taught me

186
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:09,830
what real delicacy is,

187
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:11,800
and helped me

188
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:14,320
experience the things I love.

189
00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:17,350
I'm very grateful to him.

190
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:21,940
Getting to welcome

191
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:23,750
more challenges and happiness with him

192
00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:28,540
is the luckiest

193
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:30,540
and happiest thing of my life.

194
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:34,140
So I hope

195
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:35,620
you will focus on Zheng Dao's work

196
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,720
and make fair judgments of it,

197
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:41,390
so that all can compete and compare notes in the most efficient way.

198
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:42,940
Thank you.

199
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:45,210
Now,

200
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:46,900
friends and guests, please follow me.

201
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:47,830
We've prepared

202
00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:49,740
Pan-fried Mackerel for you.

203
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:51,370
This way, please.

204
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:52,580
Thank you.

205
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:55,090
This way, please.

206
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:56,340
Both of these tables are available.

207
00:09:58,670 --> 00:09:59,500
Thank you.

208
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:01,580
Now that the interview has been so successful,

209
00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:02,760
I can let things go now.

210
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:04,590
I'm flying back to Paris soon.

211
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:06,640
We're having a celebration party tomorrow.

212
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:07,790
Are you really not coming?

213
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:11,760
Thank you.

214
00:10:15,290 --> 00:10:15,730
Zheng Dao.

215
00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:18,050
Are we still friends?

216
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:19,480
Of course.

217
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:20,790
Thank you.

218
00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:45,830
Waiter.

219
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:47,500
Hello.

220
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:49,980
Please get her a cup of warm water.

221
00:10:50,010 --> 00:10:50,450
Thank you.

222
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:51,380
Okay.

223
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:52,580
And what would you like, please?

224
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:54,100
The same.

225
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:56,940
I'm used to drinking this.

226
00:10:57,410 --> 00:10:59,910
Get her something light and low in alcohol.

227
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:00,780
It's okay.

228
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:02,340
The same as hers.

229
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:03,260
Thank you.

230
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:03,940
Okay.

231
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:14,990
What happened at the competition

232
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,430
was not my intention.

233
00:11:18,330 --> 00:11:19,660
The catering capital behind Yu Sheng

234
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:21,630
has always been the biggest customer group for Isen.

235
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:23,020
Every move of his

236
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:24,870
will directly affect Isen's future and mine.

237
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:27,750
I had no choice.

238
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:30,200
I know.

239
00:11:40,090 --> 00:11:41,250
No one can conceal

240
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:42,830
what it is that they really want.

241
00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:44,380
Right?

242
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:53,270
Miranda.

243
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:57,420
It's been almost 7 years.

244
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:00,350
Thank you.

245
00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:06,010
Seven years in the blink of an eye.

246
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:10,900
I still

247
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:14,440
feel extremely thankful that,

248
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:16,230
seven years ago,

249
00:12:18,690 --> 00:12:19,580
I chose you

250
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:20,610
and promoted you.

251
00:12:22,490 --> 00:12:23,540
You helped me a lot.

252
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:25,960
Thank you.

253
00:12:29,010 --> 00:12:29,530
Go easy on that.

254
00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:30,250
It's too strong.

255
00:12:31,490 --> 00:12:33,680
The wine I drink at business dinners is much stronger than this.

256
00:12:34,190 --> 00:12:34,980
I'm used to it.

257
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:39,460
I'll join you then.

258
00:12:50,530 --> 00:12:51,910
I'm taking the headhunter's advice

259
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:54,580
and leaving Isen.

260
00:12:55,710 --> 00:12:56,910
Do seize this opportunity.

261
00:12:58,580 --> 00:12:59,330
I believe

262
00:13:00,050 --> 00:13:01,040
you'll do better than me

263
00:13:02,090 --> 00:13:03,400
in this position.

264
00:13:05,730 --> 00:13:06,330
Mentor...

265
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:10,700
If everything goes well,

266
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:13,080
you'll be Isen's

267
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:14,870
youngest editor-in-chief.

268
00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:25,620
Put the chairs back.

269
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:28,540
Jojo,

270
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:29,830
work harder.

271
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:31,370
You didn't even wipe the glass clean.

272
00:13:32,810 --> 00:13:33,360
Honestly,

273
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:34,850
is that really necessary?

274
00:13:35,490 --> 00:13:37,370
We've never been afraid of anyone.

275
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:38,750
Mr. Fang

276
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:39,770
and Chef Zheng

277
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:41,240
have never been afraid of anyone.

278
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:42,980
-Enough with that. -Like you know!

279
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,030
Wipe it now.

280
00:13:44,170 --> 00:13:44,760
Wipe it clean.

281
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:45,700
Okay.

282
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:47,190
Be careful!

283
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:47,820
Be careful.

284
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:48,720
Excuse me!

285
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:49,580
Valuables!

286
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:51,020
Make way!

287
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,360
Valuables. Handle with care.

288
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,380
It's just some mung bean congee.

289
00:13:59,510 --> 00:14:01,030
What's with all this fuss?

290
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:02,380
What do you know?

291
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:03,900
Where's Shen Ying?

292
00:14:04,070 --> 00:14:04,910
Why isn't she here yet?

293
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,040
Must be the traffic.

294
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:06,800
I'll take a look.

295
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:07,660
I'm here!

296
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:09,420
I'm here.

297
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:09,980
There you are.

298
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:11,300
Give me a hug.

299
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:23,760
Dad.

300
00:14:25,370 --> 00:14:26,010
Sir.

301
00:14:27,150 --> 00:14:27,600
Master.

302
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:28,950
Grandmaster.

303
00:14:29,610 --> 00:14:30,090
Great grandmaster.

304
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:30,920
Great grandmaster.

305
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:36,270
Master, please take a seat.

306
00:14:42,270 --> 00:14:42,990
And this is...

307
00:14:43,270 --> 00:14:44,510
Master, you must be thirsty.

308
00:14:44,610 --> 00:14:46,120
We prepared mung bean congee for you.

309
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:49,400
The tenderness of the beans

310
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:51,410
was strictly controlled according to your requirements.

311
00:14:58,380 --> 00:14:58,900
Well done.

312
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:02,950
Why are you all on your feet?

313
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:04,630
Sit down. Come on.

314
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:05,750
Sit down.

315
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:10,300
I...

316
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,650
That was my fault.

317
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:13,770
Zheng...

318
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:14,850
Actually,

319
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,080
there were many other reasons.

320
00:15:16,330 --> 00:15:16,770
What...

321
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:18,530
-I'll take the responsibility. -I'll take the responsibility.

322
00:15:21,090 --> 00:15:21,510
Hey,

323
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:23,330
can you just let me finish?

324
00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:25,110
Come on now. Sit down.

325
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:26,380
Sit. Sit down.

326
00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:27,910
Shen Ying,

327
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,180
you say it.

328
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:31,780
Okay.

329
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:36,410
This is...

330
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:37,720
Open it.

331
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:39,830
I'll open it.

332
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:43,630
What is it?

333
00:15:49,210 --> 00:15:50,300
"Congratulations, Restaurant Si.

334
00:15:50,330 --> 00:15:52,290
You've passed the Golden Fritillaria's three-diamond test."

335
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:53,220
Really?

336
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:55,240
Yay!

337
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:56,430
Let me have a look.

338
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:57,500
It's true!

339
00:15:58,660 --> 00:15:59,430
Wait.

340
00:15:59,950 --> 00:16:01,710
Didn't we get a low score?

341
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:05,000
How did we pass this "three-diamond" thing?

342
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:06,370
And Master,

343
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:07,520
how did you know?

344
00:16:07,830 --> 00:16:09,510
I went to pick up Mr. Zheng

345
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:10,770
straight from the committee office

346
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:11,830
and told him first.

347
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:12,590
Yeah.

348
00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:14,000
I thought I'd come here

349
00:16:14,310 --> 00:16:15,570
to comfort you.

350
00:16:16,390 --> 00:16:17,470
But that's not the case now.

351
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:21,170
An instant change of atmosphere!

352
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:22,150
Later,

353
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:24,340
I'll get you a huge basket of flowers

354
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:25,690
to congratulate you!

355
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:26,860
Great!

356
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:28,260
Great!

357
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:29,500
You have been in touch with my dad?

358
00:16:29,850 --> 00:16:30,450
Of course.

359
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:32,810
We are good friends now.

360
00:16:35,310 --> 00:16:36,150
By the way, Miss Shen,

361
00:16:36,610 --> 00:16:37,850
how did we pass the test?

362
00:16:39,650 --> 00:16:40,330
Actually,

363
00:16:40,410 --> 00:16:41,770
the rules have changed this year.

364
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:43,860
They kept it a secret at first.

365
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:46,020
Even for us external judges..

366
00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:47,340
Seriously?

367
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:49,160
So what happened next?

368
00:16:50,330 --> 00:16:50,930
Fang,

369
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,130
you remember

370
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:53,950
the night when Zheng Dao was preparing a new dish,

371
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:56,490
there was a nerdy,

372
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:58,340
programmer-like man in a plaid shirt?

373
00:17:01,510 --> 00:17:01,950
Hello.

374
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:03,620
I'm sorry,

375
00:17:03,770 --> 00:17:04,849
we're closed for the day.

376
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:05,890
Why don't you come tomorrow?

377
00:17:05,910 --> 00:17:07,220
But it's not your closing time yet.

378
00:17:07,430 --> 00:17:09,430
We've been closing earlier to prepare

379
00:17:09,619 --> 00:17:10,960
for the Golden Fritillaria Competition.

380
00:17:11,210 --> 00:17:12,300
I'm really sorry.

381
00:17:12,430 --> 00:17:13,040
Chef Dong.

382
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:15,859
We run the restaurant to serve our guests.

383
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:17,720
Have this gentleman seated now.

384
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:18,560
Okay.

385
00:17:18,770 --> 00:17:20,030
Please have a seat.

386
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:23,480
Have a seat.

387
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:25,210
I do remember.

388
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:27,339
We were already closed for that day.

389
00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:28,790
He came very late

390
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:29,820
and said he wanted to eat.

391
00:17:31,030 --> 00:17:32,110
How could it be him?

392
00:17:32,290 --> 00:17:33,030
He is the CEO

393
00:17:33,050 --> 00:17:34,620
of a famous dot-com in China.

394
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:35,540
And he was very excited

395
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:37,140
when he described that scene

396
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:38,180
to us today.

397
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:41,060
So it was the score that he gave

398
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:42,960
that helped Si turn the tide?

399
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:43,620
Yes.

400
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:44,740
When I was sorting out

401
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:46,400
the result letters for mail,

402
00:17:46,490 --> 00:17:47,450
I really couldn't help it.

403
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:48,800
So I brought it here.

404
00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:53,990
Right.

405
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:56,690
Since today is a celebration day...

406
00:17:56,710 --> 00:17:57,590
There you all are.

407
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:01,130
How lively.

408
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:07,750
I heard you only welcome VIPs here.

409
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:09,080
I wonder

410
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,200
if I can have the honor

411
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:12,900
of having some noodles here.

412
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:22,210
Senior?

413
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:24,330
So you're here too.

414
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:28,090
I'll make it for you today.

415
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:29,410
Dad.

416
00:18:30,990 --> 00:18:31,970
It's okay, son.

417
00:18:32,330 --> 00:18:33,330
Thank you.

418
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:35,610
I'll wait for you here then.

419
00:18:35,910 --> 00:18:36,290
Please.

420
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:45,700
Dao,

421
00:18:46,650 --> 00:18:47,410
take me to the kitchen.

422
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:49,250
Okay, this way.

423
00:18:50,650 --> 00:18:52,050
Master, this way please.

424
00:18:58,540 --> 00:19:00,020
Aren't you going to say hello to your dad?

425
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:01,460
Why?

426
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:02,870
He's obviously up to no good.

427
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:03,320
No.

428
00:19:09,570 --> 00:19:10,470
Brat!

429
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:27,490
Sir, have some water.

430
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:30,050
Thank you.

431
00:20:43,210 --> 00:20:43,850
Director Zheng,

432
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:46,210
will our dads have a fight?

433
00:20:47,070 --> 00:20:47,530
No.

434
00:20:49,210 --> 00:20:49,950
Senior,

435
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:51,830
I'm really lucky

436
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:53,620
to get to have noodles made by you.

437
00:20:56,370 --> 00:20:57,210
I'm honored.

438
00:20:58,410 --> 00:21:01,090
You, big boss of a group,

439
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:03,980
can still

440
00:21:04,810 --> 00:21:07,890
remember this bowl of noodles made by this ordinary chef.

441
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:11,570
What are you talking about?

442
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:13,520
Am I a forgetful person?

443
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:14,900
Besides,

444
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:15,890
don't forget,

445
00:21:16,390 --> 00:21:18,440
I started off with a restaurant.

446
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:20,330
Again?

447
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:21,660
Back then,

448
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:23,180
when you opened the restaurant,

449
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:24,950
Master and I went to visit.

450
00:21:26,970 --> 00:21:28,620
You really shouldn't have mentioned it.

451
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:31,370
It only makes me feel bad when you do.

452
00:21:33,570 --> 00:21:34,230
This bowl of noodles

453
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:35,790
was nothing less than

454
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:37,330
a signature dish in my restaurant.

455
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:39,220
But when Master came,

456
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:41,000
just for a bowl of noodles,

457
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:43,160
he gave me a good scolding.

458
00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:44,280
But...

459
00:21:45,130 --> 00:21:46,160
come to think of it,

460
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:51,120
you and Master really looked down on me,

461
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:52,290
but now?

462
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:57,060
My little restaurant has grown into a food group.

463
00:21:57,660 --> 00:21:58,700
Isn't it irritating?

464
00:22:01,730 --> 00:22:03,330
If you didn't have this drive,

465
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:05,910
you wouldn't have become the boss that you are now.

466
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,380
Alright, enough about me.

467
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:09,620
What's up with you?

468
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:13,060
You want your son to follow in your steps

469
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:14,780
and be a cook?

470
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:17,070
I don't really have the energy

471
00:22:17,630 --> 00:22:18,910
to interfere in those things now.

472
00:22:21,370 --> 00:22:21,720
Hurry up.

473
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:24,020
Try it while it's hot.

474
00:22:24,190 --> 00:22:25,120
Sure.

475
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:28,700
Master

476
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:30,370
devoted his whole life

477
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:33,780
to his career as a cook.

478
00:22:34,170 --> 00:22:35,180
He had

479
00:22:35,410 --> 00:22:36,690
his own principles.

480
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:37,860
So you

481
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:39,460
shouldn't blame him.

482
00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:42,430
As for me,

483
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:47,630
I can tell you in all honesty,

484
00:22:48,210 --> 00:22:51,100
I've never looked down on you.

485
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:56,150
Twenty years ago,

486
00:22:57,030 --> 00:22:58,320
you opened a restaurant.

487
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:00,990
In less than five years,

488
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:03,520
it developed into a chain enterprise.

489
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:05,990
Then you started

490
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:08,960
many more companies related to food.

491
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:12,300
It got bigger and bigger.

492
00:23:12,810 --> 00:23:13,390
Let me tell you,

493
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:14,960
I am

494
00:23:15,690 --> 00:23:18,140
really happy for you.

495
00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:24,480
And it's not just me.

496
00:23:25,650 --> 00:23:26,980
When Master was still alive,

497
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:32,210
he cared about you all the time.

498
00:23:36,090 --> 00:23:37,040
The last time

499
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:41,380
I ate noodles made by Master

500
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:45,700
was more than 20 years ago.

501
00:23:50,110 --> 00:23:50,680
Senior,

502
00:23:53,610 --> 00:23:54,660
I miss our master...

503
00:24:00,290 --> 00:24:00,900
Junior,

504
00:24:02,710 --> 00:24:03,850
it's not sensible

505
00:24:04,270 --> 00:24:06,440
to leave yourself trapped in an obsession.

506
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:09,760
Since you were given the talent to do business,

507
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,530
you may well put it

508
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:13,820
to good use and show your strengths

509
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:14,730
in business.

510
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:19,030
There's no need

511
00:24:19,970 --> 00:24:21,450
to hold on to things of the past.

512
00:24:23,190 --> 00:24:24,030
You and I

513
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:26,160
are both over 50 years old.

514
00:24:27,060 --> 00:24:28,700
What can't we let go?

515
00:24:30,370 --> 00:24:30,890
Senior,

516
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:35,310
why is that you can,

517
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:39,590
but I can never make it taste like this?

518
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:48,380
The water should be boiled slowly.

519
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:51,790
And the noodles cooked slowly.

520
00:24:53,230 --> 00:24:55,540
Life needs to be slow.

521
00:24:56,470 --> 00:24:58,300
Don't rush for everything.

522
00:25:00,330 --> 00:25:01,170
In the end,

523
00:25:02,550 --> 00:25:03,540
don't we all

524
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:06,820
walk to the finish line

525
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:07,800
following our own paths?

526
00:25:08,870 --> 00:25:09,320
Junior,

527
00:25:09,970 --> 00:25:10,830
am I right?
