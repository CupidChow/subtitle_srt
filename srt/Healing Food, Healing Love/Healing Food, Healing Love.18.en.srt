This is the first exhibition of my best friend

00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:26,010
in her life.

7
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:26,900
Congratulations.

What?

00:02:30,579 --> 00:02:31,260
How is it?

10
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:36,020
It's my honor, Zhuang.

11
00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:53,640
You need an answer.

12
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:55,760
I hope you can

13
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:57,540
find the answer here.

Be it good or bad,

we'll always support you.

16
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,110
Hello, Zhuang Yan.

17
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:33,760
My name is Yu Sicheng.

18
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:36,640
It's my first time calling your name directly.

19
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:37,730
It's a bit serious.

20
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:39,840
I feel a bit embarrassed

21
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,410
because it's so formal.

22
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,890
Do you like this exhibition?

23
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:44,730
Look.

24
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:45,860
In order to carry the frames,

25
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,560
I hurt several parts of my hands.

26
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,380
For the sake of my hard work,

27
00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:52,450
shouldn't you praise me?

28
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:54,260
I know

29
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:55,930
your biggest dream

30
00:03:56,450 --> 00:03:57,570
is to hold a photography exhibition.

31
00:03:59,070 --> 00:03:59,579
This time,

32
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,000
with my own efforts...

33
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,350
I didn't rely on anyone else.

34
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:04,280
Not at all.

35
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:06,150
With my own efforts,

36
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:07,950
I accomplished the first thing for you.

37
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:08,920
Of course,

38
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,460
I'll do my best in the future

39
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:13,620
to do the tenth, the 100th, the 1000th,

I have the courage to face the future with you

42
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:23,490
and want to create a future that belongs to us.

Trust me.

46
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:29,840
I will grow up

47
00:04:30,890 --> 00:04:31,930
and become more mature.

48
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:34,250
Believe me.

49
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:52,050
Hi,

50
00:04:55,659 --> 00:04:56,280
Do you like it?

51
00:04:57,860 --> 00:04:58,290
I...

52
00:04:59,260 --> 00:04:59,980
I can't even count

53
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:01,530
how many times I've confessed my love to you.

54
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:02,980
But...

55
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:04,100
Yan,

56
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:07,410
I have a wish.

57
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:09,350
Can I

58
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:11,360
be your

59
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:13,460
assistant,

60

61

62
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,370
and a lifetime partner forever?

63
00:05:58,250 --> 00:05:58,940
It's okay.

64
00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:01,380
I'm here.

65
00:06:02,850 --> 00:06:03,450
Don't cry.

66
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:11,520
Don't cry.

67
00:06:17,890 --> 00:06:18,660
I...

68
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:23,560
haven't said...

69
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:27,590
I like you yet.

70
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:32,220
All right.

71
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:35,690
But I...

72
00:06:36,659 --> 00:06:37,870
dare not accept you.

73
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:42,040
Many factors concerning reality

74
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:44,540
lie between us.

75
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,090
I don't think I'm good enough.

76
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:26,590
Mr Yu.

77
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,510
Young Mr. Yu and the girl named Zhuang Yan

78
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:30,340
go together again.

79
00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:35,390
That brat.

80
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:36,659
Go.

81
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:38,420
Call him over!

82
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:39,840
Roger.

83
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:45,780
So lovey-dovey.

84
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:46,260
They're so sweet.

85
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:46,830
Yan,

86
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:48,100
are you tired after working for a whole day?

87
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:48,500
No.

88
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:49,170
Let me give you a massage.

89
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:50,780
I'm not tired. Stop it.

90
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:54,170
I'll give you a massage when we arrive home.

91
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:57,640
Yan,

92
00:07:57,690 --> 00:07:58,530
let me carry your purse.

93
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:00,060
No, I can carry it myself.

94
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:01,840
How can I let you take it yourself?

95
00:08:02,170 --> 00:08:02,810
My arms are born

96
00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:03,730
to carry your purse.

97
00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:05,100
Look.

98
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:07,080
Be gentle.

99
00:08:09,610 --> 00:08:10,560
What do you want to eat today?

100
00:08:10,930 --> 00:08:11,340
Tell me.

101
00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:12,330
I'll cook for you.

102
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,240
Great.

103
00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:16,010
Well,

104
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:18,460
Sweet and Sour Pork Tenderloin.

105
00:08:19,810 --> 00:08:21,250
Okay, Sweet and Sour Pork Tenderloin.

106
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:22,310
You do the dishes.

107
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:25,850
Yan, wait for me.

108
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:32,110
Young Mr. Yu.

109
00:08:33,049 --> 00:08:33,830
The chairman is waiting for you.

110
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:35,970
Tell him

111
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:38,120
I... am not available.

112
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,460
Please cooperate with me.

113
00:08:40,169 --> 00:08:40,850
Otherwise...

114
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:45,660
You...

115
00:08:48,170 --> 00:08:48,730
Yan.

116
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:50,410
I'm going to talk to the old man.

117
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:51,130
I'll be back soon.

118
00:08:51,770 --> 00:08:52,300
Go back and cook first.

119
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:53,700
Okay.

120
00:08:54,170 --> 00:08:54,680
I'm leaving.

121
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:00,680
There you go.

122
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:23,240
Good tea.

123
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:26,680
You plant it?

124
00:09:28,090 --> 00:09:29,360
You even plant flowers.

125
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:31,290
Let me see.

126
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:36,260
It's... It's not good.

127
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:42,530
The handwriting is good though.

128
00:09:43,810 --> 00:09:44,650
It can rival

129
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,630
the one I drew on the wall in your room

130
00:09:46,810 --> 00:09:47,370
when I was a kid.

131
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:49,180
But if comparing them seriously,

132
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,410
mine is a little better.

133
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:07,590
Mr. Yu, tell me.

134
00:10:08,430 --> 00:10:10,070
What do you want from me?

135
00:10:10,770 --> 00:10:11,980
You suddenly care about me.

136
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:13,700
I'm not used to it.

137
00:10:14,650 --> 00:10:15,570
Look at you.

138
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:17,870
You told me

139
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:20,100
you were going to find your own life.

140
00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:22,960
That's it?

141
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,980
This is the life you want?

142
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,290
Nice shot.

143
00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:33,580
What?

144
00:10:34,850 --> 00:10:37,140
Does your secretary still do photography now?

145
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:38,500
He can come to our company.

146
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:39,830
We have a Photography Department.

147
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:41,870
Look at it yourself.

148
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,490
You even did such a thing

149
00:10:45,130 --> 00:10:46,100
in public.

150
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:47,800
You...

151
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:49,430
You've disgraced the Yu family.

152
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:53,130
What?

153
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:55,700
This is disgrace...

154
00:10:58,430 --> 00:10:59,230
in your eyes.

155
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:01,090
Yu family?

156
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:03,370
What's with the Yu family?

157
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:05,020
Have you forgotten?

158
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:07,290
You also started from a commis chef.

159
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:08,470
And you know what?

160
00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:10,510
This is the first time

161
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:12,910
I've done so many things

162
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:15,940
through my own efforts.

163
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:18,080
You just...

164
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,920
You just saw a few stupid photos

165
00:11:20,390 --> 00:11:21,250
and said such words to me.

166
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:23,010
You never cared about me.

167
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,200
No matter what you say,

168
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:28,460
I'm warning you.

169
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:31,430
If you take one step closer to this woman,

170
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:33,950
don't step foot in the Yu family any longer.

171
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:36,050
Go to your company now.

172
00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:37,610
Resign and go home.

173
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:39,500
What a coincidence.

174
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:40,990
I didn't want to come here at all.

175
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:42,990
Your bodyguard invited me.

176
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:45,090
Fine.

177
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:48,610
You can ask me to leave you alone.

178
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:50,310
But remember,

179
00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:51,730
from now on,

180
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:53,950
you won't get a penny from me.

181
00:11:56,210 --> 00:11:56,770
Okay.

182
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:01,640
The bank card. The credit card.

183
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:03,570
All yours!

184
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:06,020
You...

185
00:12:06,170 --> 00:12:06,810
Listen!

186
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:09,070
From today,

187
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:10,820
I won't show up in front of you,

188
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:11,700
bothering you anymore.

189
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:12,870
Therefore,

190
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:15,380
for my own business, please have mercy on me.

191
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:16,700
Don't interfere in any single one!

192
00:12:18,950 --> 00:12:19,360
Come back.

193
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:21,190
Come back now!

194
00:12:21,410 --> 00:12:21,920
No!

195
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:27,120
Never come back if you have the guts!

196
00:12:38,970 --> 00:12:40,890
How is it going with your dad?

197
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,120
Don't panic.

198
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,130
Impulse causes trouble.

199
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:01,140
Who is it?

200
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:01,720
My takeaway.

201
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:02,660
Fetch it for me.

202
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:05,300
I'm at home.

203
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:06,730
Why do you still order a takeaway?

204
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:09,970
Yu Sicheng.

205
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:11,350
Yan.

206
00:13:11,930 --> 00:13:12,450
What? Did you hurt?

207
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:14,280
What situation?

208
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:17,280
-Yu Sicheng? -Yu Sicheng?

209
00:13:23,590 --> 00:13:24,710
Spill it, Mr. Yu.

210
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:27,450
The case, the bag,

211
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:29,880
and the stuffed animal.

212
00:13:30,370 --> 00:13:31,140
What do they mean?

213
00:13:33,690 --> 00:13:34,810
Simply put...

214
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:38,460
Anyway...

215
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,810
I was kicked out by my father today.

216
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:44,660
Jian,

217
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:46,480
I'm penniless

218
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:49,340
and homeless.

219
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:54,760
Is he trying to...

220
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:56,440
Jian, Ying,

221
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,720
you won't let me live on the street.

222
00:13:59,330 --> 00:13:59,730
Right?

223
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:01,340
Zhuang Yan.

224
00:14:02,330 --> 00:14:02,750
Tell us.

225
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:04,500
Are you two in cahoots?

226
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,580
I swear.

227
00:14:06,610 --> 00:14:07,660
I didn't know anything.

228
00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:10,750
No way.

229
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:12,560
Young Master Yu, instead of inheriting

230
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:13,470
your family property,

231
00:14:13,650 --> 00:14:15,310
you'd rather suffer down here?

232
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:16,510
No.

233
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:18,640
I had a fight with my dad today.

234
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:20,420
But I thought

235
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:22,240
there are bro and sis here

236
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:22,940
who support my dream so much.

237
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:24,330
That's why I decided to fight

238
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:25,360
for once.

239
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:26,540
What dream?

240
00:14:26,970 --> 00:14:28,170
The dream of pursuing Yan.

241
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:32,950
Stop it. Let go.

242
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,060
Stop it.

243
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,040
If I did something wrong,

244
00:14:36,410 --> 00:14:37,700
you can ask the court to punish me.

245
00:14:38,770 --> 00:14:40,680
But I don't want to engage in a public display of affection

246
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:41,770
when I haven't had dinner.

247
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:44,040
What a pity.

248
00:14:44,070 --> 00:14:45,720
There are only three rooms in our house.

249
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:46,910
We each have one.

250
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:49,180
We don't have extra rooms.

251
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:49,690
It doesn't matter.

252
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:51,010
I've made up my mind.

253
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:52,210
Zhuang Yan and I...

254
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:55,810
I...

255
00:14:57,450 --> 00:14:59,170
I like sleeping on the sofa since I was a child.

256
00:14:59,450 --> 00:15:00,050
I can sleep here.

257
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:01,690
Here.

258
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,570
I have an extra quilt.

259
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:06,440
Zhuang Yan.

260
00:15:07,130 --> 00:15:08,540
A grown-up girl will always leave us.

261
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:10,500
I...

262
00:15:10,650 --> 00:15:13,170
actually have a simple question.

263
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:18,350
What should we do

264
00:15:18,370 --> 00:15:19,980
with the bowls after we have meals in the future?

265
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:21,100
I'll deal with them.

266
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,460
How can I let the water that cleans bowls

267
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:24,980
dirty your hands?

268
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,910
Who will do the waste sorting?

269
00:15:28,170 --> 00:15:29,220
I'm good at that.

270
00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:31,020
I've been good at garbage classification since I was a kid.

271
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:32,240
No one is better than me.

272
00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:33,820
The floor...

273
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:35,470
For many days, our marble floor hasn't been...

274
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:36,140
Let me do it.

275
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,360
Don't take it from me.

276
00:15:38,050 --> 00:15:40,640
I promise there will be not a speck of dust on the floor.

277
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,360
I'll lose if there's a hair on it.

278
00:15:44,530 --> 00:15:45,100
Satisfied!

279
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:47,300
Zhuang, I agree. What about you?

280
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:50,900
Then, I... I will say yes as well.

281
00:15:56,420 --> 00:15:58,420
Congratulations to Bai for passing the exam

282
00:15:58,580 --> 00:16:00,820
and having a chance to study in France.

283
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:02,110
Thank you all.

284
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:05,950
I won't refuse a single cup today.

285
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:07,050
I won't refuse it for real.

286
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:07,540
Here.

287
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:08,420
I won’t say no to wines.

288
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:10,780
Mr. Fang is too generous.

289
00:16:11,210 --> 00:16:11,950
Are you full?

290
00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:14,310
Have some fruits.

291
00:16:14,370 --> 00:16:15,290
Help digest the food.

292
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:16,780
Fang is so nice.

293
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,060
Since everyone is here,

294
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:21,540
let's move on to the next topic.

295
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:22,060
OK.

296
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:22,710
Bai,

297
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:24,490
get ready to your gifts.

298
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:25,450
I'll be the first one.

299
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:27,150
Thank you, Ying.

300
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:27,650
Open it.

301
00:16:27,650 --> 00:16:28,310
What is this?

302
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:31,470
It's a recorder

303
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:32,560
which can translate.

304
00:16:32,770 --> 00:16:33,980
If you don't understand when studying abroad,

305
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:35,170
record it and listen to it a few more times.

306
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:37,180
Thank you, Ying.

307
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:37,890
Bai.

308
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:39,470
I don’t know what I should buy you.

309
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:41,280
I've transferred some money to you on WeChat.

310
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:42,540
Take good care of yourself abroad.

311
00:16:42,890 --> 00:16:44,000
Thank you, Dao.

312
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:44,800
Thank you.

313
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:45,500
Bai,

314
00:16:46,010 --> 00:16:48,290
there is a set of airline vouchers.

315
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:49,460
You can use it anytime.

316
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:50,960
When you miss us,

317
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:51,700
fly back at once.

318
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:53,300
Thank you, Yan.

319
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:55,540
What's the point of coming back?

320
00:16:55,610 --> 00:16:56,540
We're just old friends.

321
00:16:56,710 --> 00:16:57,700
Bai, look at your phone.

322
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:00,850
I’ve sent you the contact information of my childhood friend in France

323
00:17:00,890 --> 00:17:01,370
to you.

324
00:17:01,490 --> 00:17:02,180
Don't be shy.

325
00:17:02,210 --> 00:17:03,090
Go find him.

326
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:04,349
He will take you to have fun.

327
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:05,150
Most importantly,

328
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:06,060
French boys

329
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:07,099
are really good and handsome.

330
00:17:07,099 --> 00:17:07,770
All right.

331
00:17:07,770 --> 00:17:08,260
I will stop it.

332
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:09,540
Don’t lead Bai astray.

333
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:10,500
Here.

334
00:17:11,089 --> 00:17:12,990
This is a watch from me.

335
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:14,829
Thank you, Uncle Frank.

336
00:17:14,859 --> 00:17:16,190
I hope you can cherish your time

337
00:17:16,290 --> 00:17:16,970
and study hard.

338
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:17,950
We'll wait for you to come back.

339
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:18,900
Thank you.

340
00:17:19,130 --> 00:17:19,540
Bai,

341
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:21,540
I have nothing special to give you.

342
00:17:21,619 --> 00:17:22,619
I'll give you a notebook.

343
00:17:22,990 --> 00:17:24,240
If you have something on your mind,

344
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:25,240
I'll be online anyway.

345
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:26,160
24/7.

346
00:17:26,609 --> 00:17:27,970
If you really don't want to talk about it,

347
00:17:28,099 --> 00:17:28,900
just write it down.

348
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:29,980
It's a kind of relief.

349
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:31,460
Thank you, Duo.

350
00:17:31,530 --> 00:17:32,620
I really like it.

351
00:17:33,770 --> 00:17:34,370
Where's Fang?

352
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:35,740
I don't know.

353
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:36,660
After dining with us,

354
00:17:36,770 --> 00:17:37,640
he just left?

355
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:41,980
Bai,

356
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:43,190
this is a gift from me.

357
00:17:44,450 --> 00:17:45,280
Sauté Chinese Toon Buds.

358
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:46,940
What is this?

359
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:47,760
What is this?

360
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:50,510
This is the first batch of toon buds

361
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:51,780
before Grain Rain.

362
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:52,950
The leaves are tender

363
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:53,690
and have a scented smell.

364
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:55,060
I specially made it for Bai.

365
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:57,400
Don't supermarkets have them?

366
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:58,660
You need to cook it for half a month?

367
00:17:58,950 --> 00:17:59,530
Seriously?

368
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:00,700
Try it.

369
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:12,000
Grandpa.

370
00:18:16,310 --> 00:18:16,720
Look.

371
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:18,420
What Fang made

372
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:19,910
is really amazing.

373
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,040
Bai is enjoying it so seriously.

374
00:18:23,010 --> 00:18:24,510
She even forgets to leave some for us.

375
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:25,090
Right?

376
00:18:26,570 --> 00:18:27,220
Xu,

377
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:28,420
do you want to have punches?

378
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:30,440
I dare not.

379
00:18:30,790 --> 00:18:32,010
All right. All right.

380
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:33,380
We gather here today

381
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:35,420
mainly to send Bai off.

382
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:36,780
I hope everything goes well for Bai

383
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:39,140
when she studies abroad and comes back.

384
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:39,700
Cheers!

385
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:40,120
Cheers!

386
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:41,060
Cheers.

387
00:18:41,570 --> 00:18:41,980
Congratulations.

388
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:50,140
Don't you have arms?

389
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:50,770
Eat it yourself.

390
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:52,250
Fine.

391
00:18:52,290 --> 00:18:52,960
Let me feed you.

392
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:56,380
I'm here to suffer from public displays of affection again, right?

393
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:57,340
Not just you.

394
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:00,120
Get me one.

395
00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:01,020
Fang,

396
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:01,850
what's that look on your face?

397
00:19:02,570 --> 00:19:02,840
Oh, right.

398
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:03,900
By the way,

399
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:05,800
why are you always single?

400
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:11,700
N-No. I'm fine.

401
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:13,160
Tell me.

402
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:14,720
Yes, tell us.

403
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:15,860
We all want to hear it.

404
00:19:16,370 --> 00:19:17,260
It's okay.

405
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:18,040
Tell us.

406
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:20,080
Alright.

407
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:21,980
If Fang doesn't want to say it,

408
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:23,620
then don't force him.

409
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:25,900
I didn't force him.

410
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:27,380
We are all good friends, right?

411
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:28,560
Let's talk.

412
00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:31,330
T-There's nothing I can't say.

413
00:19:31,530 --> 00:19:31,950
It's just because

414
00:19:33,450 --> 00:19:35,200
I was self-centered when I was young.

415
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:38,090
I always thought I should have my own career.

416
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:40,170
I should gain my place.

417
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:41,010
I should own...

418
00:19:42,310 --> 00:19:45,660
Then, I left feelings and marriage

419
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,240
behind.

420
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,310
So in the end,

421
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,080
I hurt the person who loved me the most.

422
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:56,880
That's all.

423
00:19:57,990 --> 00:19:58,310
Here.

424
00:19:58,970 --> 00:19:59,540
A toast for you.

425
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:07,490
I think I'm more mature these years.

426
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:08,760
I know

427
00:20:08,930 --> 00:20:09,800
there is a responsibilty we should take

428
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:13,770
behind every relationship

429
00:20:14,110 --> 00:20:15,540
and marriage.

430
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:19,890
But I dare not...

431
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:21,100
Dare not... Dare not...

432
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:21,980
I dare not.

433
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:24,720
Here.

434
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:27,330
Okay.

435
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:28,830
I'll make some side dishes

436
00:20:29,330 --> 00:20:31,090
so that you can have something to eat.

437
00:20:31,110 --> 00:20:31,390
Okay.

438
00:20:35,770 --> 00:20:37,150
I need to go to the bathroom.

439
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:44,900
Bai,

440
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:47,460
if you didn't tell Fang Siwei

441
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:49,620
your feelings for him,

442
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:51,600
you may never

443
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:53,570
get out of this relationship.

444
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:56,390
But

445
00:20:58,250 --> 00:20:59,960
I still don't have the nerve.

446
00:21:00,490 --> 00:21:02,010
I just hope you can seize the chance.

447
00:21:12,690 --> 00:21:13,990
I think it tastes good.

448
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:16,330
Fang.

449
00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:17,840
What are you thinking?

450
00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:28,940
Yan, give me a piece of meat and let me have a try.

451
00:21:33,670 --> 00:21:34,370
Have a bite.

452
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,100
Dr. Xu.

453
00:21:38,410 --> 00:21:39,240
Tell me

454
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:42,660
what Li Bai wants.

455
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:44,670
She needs you.

456
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:55,170
Li Bai deserves her own pursuit now

457
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:57,760
at her beautiful age.

458
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:00,960
She deserves her own

459
00:22:02,210 --> 00:22:03,480
vast world.

460
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:07,690
She should meet some right person

461
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:09,330
who belongs to her.

462
00:22:13,690 --> 00:22:14,230
It's not me.

463
00:22:15,630 --> 00:22:16,100
I am not that person.

464
00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:19,850
I'm not.

465
00:22:20,850 --> 00:22:21,350
Fang Siwei.

466
00:22:21,930 --> 00:22:22,560
Li Bai

467
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:25,130
is braver than you.

468
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:38,300
[Pazhou Bridge South]

469
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:44,110
Why don't you let us send you to the airport?

470
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:46,730
The airport shuttle bus is so convenient.

471
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:47,580
Besides,

472
00:22:47,850 --> 00:22:48,940
I'm an adult.

473
00:22:49,570 --> 00:22:51,270
Adults usually leave on their own.

474
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:54,220
I don't want to see those crying scenes.

475
00:22:56,980 --> 00:22:57,780
You

476
00:22:58,620 --> 00:22:59,790
are just a kid.

477
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:01,890
You always act like an adult.

478
00:23:04,090 --> 00:23:06,930
Because I really desire to grow up.

479
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:08,140
Fang,

480
00:23:08,450 --> 00:23:09,940
I just want to grow up quickly

481
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:12,220
and boast the same strength

482
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:12,990
as that of someone I like.

483
00:23:18,690 --> 00:23:20,510
After you arrive there,

484
00:23:20,790 --> 00:23:21,660
take good care of yourself.

485
00:23:21,710 --> 00:23:23,230
If you are bullied,

486
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:25,160
call us anytime.

487
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:27,700
If I

488
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:29,850
want to eat Sauté Chinese Toon Buds abroad,

489
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:30,510
what should I do?

490
00:23:31,430 --> 00:23:32,930
I'll cook for you next time.

491
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:36,940
When is the next time?

492
00:23:37,150 --> 00:23:40,490
J-Just...

493
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:48,620
Give it to me.

494
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:55,300
Let me help you.

495
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:00,080
Thank you, sir.

496
00:24:08,890 --> 00:24:09,690
Fang.

497
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:10,720
You know what?

498
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:12,940
The moon is the only satellite of earth.

499
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:15,460
Li Bai and the moon are close.

500
00:24:16,010 --> 00:24:18,480
So, can I be your only satellite?

501
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:32,190
You are a doctor.

502
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:34,220
How come you have so much spare time to always come to my house?

503
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:36,570
Without beauties,

504
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:37,860
I can only hang out with my friend.

505
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:40,020
Zheng Dao.

506
00:24:40,430 --> 00:24:41,010
Take me out.

507
00:24:41,190 --> 00:24:42,030
It's so boring.

508
00:24:42,170 --> 00:24:42,900
Help.

509
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:48,460
How heartless!

510
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:56,380
Hello, Shen Ying.

511
00:24:57,650 --> 00:24:58,640
Director Zheng.

512
00:24:58,940 --> 00:25:00,330
Did you have a good rest today?

513
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:02,340
I guess you have nothing to do.

514
00:25:04,210 --> 00:25:05,050
How are you today?

515
00:25:08,370 --> 00:25:09,390
After the meeting this morning,

516
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:11,130
Miranda told me

517
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:12,840
to publish the interview in advance.

518
00:25:13,330 --> 00:25:14,800
I have to work overtime tomorrow.

519
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:16,580
What about Director Zheng?

520
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:18,230
Are you free tomorrow?

521
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:19,850
Do you want to go for a walk?

522
00:25:20,630 --> 00:25:21,440
I'm free tomorrow.

523
00:25:21,810 --> 00:25:22,240
Go ahead.

524
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:23,020
What's the matter?

525
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:28,260
Come on.

526
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:28,740
Stop him!

527
00:25:29,210 --> 00:25:30,630
Go! Go!

528
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:34,700
Defence! Hurry!

529
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:35,180
Nice shot!

530
00:25:35,330 --> 00:25:35,940
Come on!

531
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:38,780
Stop him!

532
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:40,060
Keep an eye on him.

533
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:46,620
Fabulous!

534
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:49,500
Beautiful.

535
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:00,400
Bye.

536
00:26:00,430 --> 00:26:01,350
-Bye. -Bye.

537
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:03,430
Come here, buddy.

538
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:08,180
Who are you?

539
00:26:09,690 --> 00:26:11,070
1.8 meters tall. Wearing Kobe.

540
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:12,280
It's you.

541
00:26:12,330 --> 00:26:12,820
Come with me.

542
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:13,780
What?

543
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:15,180
You want to grab a man

544
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:16,300
in broad daylight?

545
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:18,500
I got someone behind me, you know?

546
00:26:19,050 --> 00:26:19,420
Who?

547
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:21,920
I have a fierce elder sister.

548
00:26:22,650 --> 00:26:23,460
For someone like you,

549
00:26:24,530 --> 00:26:25,310
she can beat down ten of them.

550
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:26,420
Really?

551
00:26:26,670 --> 00:26:27,180
She's so impressive?

552
00:26:27,890 --> 00:26:28,390
Are you scared?

553
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:29,890
I advise you to stop now.

554
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:30,740
And behave yourself.

555
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:32,230
Alright, stop being glib.

556
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:33,140
Pack up and go.

557
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:34,890
No, uncle.

558
00:26:35,410 --> 00:26:36,730
Do you think I'm a pushover?

559
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:38,320
I discourage you to commit a crime.

560
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:39,290
Call me brother.

561
00:26:41,930 --> 00:26:42,810
Hey, little brat.

562
00:26:43,090 --> 00:26:44,330
I have to work overtime today,

563
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:45,970
so I sent a strong man to pick you up.

564
00:26:47,070 --> 00:26:47,870
Brother Fan Jian?

565
00:26:48,050 --> 00:26:48,660
No.

566
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:49,440
It doesn't matter.

567
00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:50,380
Anyway,

568
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:51,580
he wears a suit

569
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:53,260
and always maintains a poker face.

570
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:58,880
You are the super...

571
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:01,500
handsome guy my sis mentioned who will come to pick me up, right?

572
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:03,870
It's me.

573
00:27:04,450 --> 00:27:05,170
Pack up and go.

574
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:06,720
That's enough.

575
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:08,570
I suggest you

576
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:11,450
not to be narcissistic in front of me.

577
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:17,600
The car is over here.

578
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:24,860
What took you so long?

579
00:27:25,350 --> 00:27:26,470
I've been waiting for you.

580
00:27:30,530 --> 00:27:30,900
Thanks.

581
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:34,460
This is Shen Ying's younger brother?

582
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:35,940
What a nice guy.

583
00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:38,260
Don't talk nonsense.

584
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:40,270
What's nice?

585
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:43,000
Let me introduce you.

586
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:44,270
This is my neighbor, Xu Duo.

587
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:46,700
Hi, hello.

588
00:27:47,130 --> 00:27:47,610
Hello.

589
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:50,610
I didn't expect Shen Ying who is careless

590
00:27:51,450 --> 00:27:52,300
to have a cute little brother.

591
00:27:54,910 --> 00:27:55,440
I don't blame you anymore.

592
00:27:57,980 --> 00:27:58,420
Let's go.

593
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:00,660
What are you waiting for?

594
00:28:00,710 --> 00:28:01,590
Don't be shy.

595
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:02,020
Come on.

596
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:02,740
Hurry up.

597
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:04,840
Don't be shy.

598
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:05,400
Hurry up.

599
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:13,180
Today, you are Brother Zheng Dao.

600
00:28:13,490 --> 00:28:14,370
Your status has moved to the next level.

601
00:28:16,450 --> 00:28:17,070
Will you go home?

602
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:18,860
Do you still love me?

603
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:23,420
Shut up.

604
00:28:25,050 --> 00:28:26,090
You're so cold to me again.

605
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:27,960
Just like what normal men do.

606
00:28:28,470 --> 00:28:29,350
When they have a new lover,

607
00:28:30,010 --> 00:28:31,010
they'll forget their old ones.

608
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:35,660
What kind of adult topic are you talking about?

609
00:28:37,150 --> 00:28:37,770
Well...

610
00:28:37,830 --> 00:28:38,670
Don't listen to his nonsense.

611
00:28:38,770 --> 00:28:39,330
He likes to joke.

612
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:40,070
What about Xinyi?

613
00:28:40,450 --> 00:28:41,000
What should we do about her?

614
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:42,140
When you go home,

615
00:28:42,170 --> 00:28:44,240
remember to feed her on time, okay?

616
00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:45,690
I didn't want to take you out.

617
00:28:46,530 --> 00:28:47,280
Go home yourself later.

618
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:49,680
I just want to stay with you a little longer.

619
00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:51,490
As long as you are happy.

620
00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:52,900
I'm not important.

621
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:57,490
Send me to the clinic later.

622
00:29:00,250 --> 00:29:01,360
Stop at the subway station ahead.

623
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:02,960
You have to take the highway.

624
00:29:03,610 --> 00:29:04,740
Send her brother back now.

625
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:06,060
Fine.

626
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:10,110
Hello.

627
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:11,620
My parents will be back soon.

628
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:12,610
Let me ask you some questions.

629
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:14,750
Answer whatever I ask.

630
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:16,390
Okay.

631
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:23,010
Will you comment on Shen Ying's Moments?

632
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:24,000
Moments?

633
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:26,620
I don't usually read Moments.

634
00:29:27,850 --> 00:29:29,720
You don't admit your relationship in public?

635
00:29:30,570 --> 00:29:31,300
Scum.

636
00:29:34,490 --> 00:29:35,220
Will you

637
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:37,610
bring her to meet your friends?

638
00:29:38,290 --> 00:29:38,840
Does Xu Duo count?

639
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:41,090
As for others,

640
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:42,700
they are our common friends.

641
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:43,460
She has basically known all of them.

642
00:29:43,850 --> 00:29:44,810
That man just now?

643
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:46,480
Isn't that...

644
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:48,300
your lover?

645
00:29:50,190 --> 00:29:50,860
A marriage fraud?

646
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:54,770
Will you buy her any gift?

647
00:29:54,950 --> 00:29:55,540
Gift?

648
00:29:57,740 --> 00:29:59,620
I'm not good at buying gifts for girls.

649
00:30:00,050 --> 00:30:01,140
Gaslighting!

650
00:30:01,330 --> 00:30:02,220
Strike.

651
00:30:04,090 --> 00:30:04,380
What?

652
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:07,100
Nothing.

653
00:30:07,810 --> 00:30:09,160
Basketball. I talked about basketball.

654
00:30:11,860 --> 00:30:12,730
My stomach hurts.

655
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:13,330
Wait for me.

656
00:30:14,010 --> 00:30:14,500
Don't go.

657
00:30:15,030 --> 00:30:15,560
Wait for me.

658
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:24,330
Hello, mister.

659
00:30:24,530 --> 00:30:25,140
I'm Zheng Dao.

660
00:30:27,250 --> 00:30:27,780
Hello, mister.

661
00:30:27,970 --> 00:30:28,490
I'm Zheng Dao.

662
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:37,640
Dear father and mother,

663
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:38,750
it's urgent.

664
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:40,490
Your daughter met a scumbag.

665
00:30:41,010 --> 00:30:42,650
I've controlled the enemy in our living room now.

666
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:43,490
Come quickly.

667
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:47,150
What?

668
00:30:47,950 --> 00:30:49,330
We're on our way to the scene in a rush.

669
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:50,060
No panic.
