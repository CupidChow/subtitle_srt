176
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:38,570
It's made by Liu Wei.

177
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,020
You call your dad by his name?

178
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:41,940
In our city,

179
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:43,610
everyone is equal in front of delicious food.

180
00:11:58,020 --> 00:11:59,260
I've told you over and over again.

181
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,820
Strawberries are not sour enough in this season.

182
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:02,260
It has to be red raspberries from Yunnan.

183
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:04,740
Now it's overly sweet,

184
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:05,840
the layer is completely gone.

185
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:07,180
What's the use of it looking good?

186
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:09,050
But we've already made the syrup.

187
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:10,960
The process is too complicated.

188
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:12,660
I can't redo it now.

189
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:18,570
Right, go and prepare

190
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,880
Osmanthus flowers, honey, Longjing tea, and a blender.

191
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:21,450
Okay.

192
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:34,140
Shen Ying,

193
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:35,820
come to my office.

194
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:37,180
Okay.

195
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:42,440
She's probably curious about your fiancé...

196
00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:44,560
about your ex-fiancé.

197
00:12:45,410 --> 00:12:46,410
I'm curious too.

198
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:48,220
Why not use your curiosity

199
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:49,410
on your work instead?

200
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:53,660
I'm just concerned for you.

201
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:11,380
The usual.

202
00:13:11,650 --> 00:13:13,650
Hot mocha without milk or sugar.

203
00:13:14,530 --> 00:13:14,850
Sit.

204
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:29,260
Some cosmetics endorsed by the cover girl.

205
00:13:29,530 --> 00:13:31,380
It's the latest. I got you a set.

206
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:33,940
Weren't you taking a two-week leave?

207
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:35,300
Why are you back so soon?

208
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:36,700
Miranda,

209
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:38,740
well...

210
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:41,980
I still want to do the interview with Han Tian Villa's

211
00:13:42,170 --> 00:13:42,920
coffee club.

212
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:46,620
When I asked you last month...

213
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:47,850
I'd still like to try to get the position

214
00:13:47,850 --> 00:13:48,620
of Deputy Editor.

215
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:50,180
But...

216
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:52,500
the headquarters in Italy has already announced

217
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:53,980
that they'd appointed someone

218
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:54,940
to take charge of it.

219
00:13:54,970 --> 00:13:56,020
Someone appointed?

220
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:57,460
Twenty grams of Osmanthus flowers.

221
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:58,130
Soak them in boiling water.

222
00:13:59,570 --> 00:13:59,970
Longjing tea.

223
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,550
Mince and grind it. Make it fine.

224
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:02,930
Pay attention to the water's temperature.

225
00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:04,920
Is this okay?

226
00:14:07,130 --> 00:14:08,310
Add some honey into it.

227
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:08,820
Okay.

228
00:14:10,970 --> 00:14:11,620
Careful with your grinding.

229
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:38,410
The dish "Feizi" is named after me.

230
00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:44,970
It has nothing to do with Mr. Zheng Dao.

231
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:46,770
Zheng Dao and I...

232
00:14:47,450 --> 00:14:48,650
there's nothing between us.

233
00:14:56,670 --> 00:14:57,520
Have a try.

234
00:15:05,710 --> 00:15:07,630
The bitterness of matcha and the fragrance of Osmanthus flowers

235
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:10,340
can neutralize the sweetness of your dessert.

236
00:15:10,990 --> 00:15:11,590
But keep in mind,

237
00:15:11,830 --> 00:15:13,630
you need mint to mix their fragrance.

238
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:14,990
Let the judges

239
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:16,070
drink this

240
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:17,270
before tasting the dessert.

241
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:18,790
I don't think you'll lose.

242
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:21,630
And I haven't named it yet.

243
00:15:21,970 --> 00:15:22,900
Help me think of one.

244
00:15:23,650 --> 00:15:24,350
I have to go now.

245
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:28,020
Thank you, Zheng.

246
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:29,900
Don't forget there's an interview on Monday.

247
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:30,900
Got it.

248
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:35,580
You started it!

249
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:36,920
Stop. Stop.

250
00:15:40,810 --> 00:15:41,890
Wearing a ring while swimming?

251
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:43,620
Think you're the only one who has it?

252
00:15:58,090 --> 00:15:59,290
I have a ring too.

253
00:15:59,510 --> 00:16:01,650
Shen Ying, I'm sorry.

254
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:04,300
I can't marry you.

255
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,500
Alright, stop it now.

256
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:12,200
-Come on catch me! -Wait!

257
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:13,720
You can't catch me!

258
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:16,430
Stop!

259
00:16:16,990 --> 00:16:17,930
It's mine now!

260
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:19,660
Give it back!

261
00:16:28,710 --> 00:16:30,210
Who is this?

262
00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:32,000
So handsome.

263
00:16:34,290 --> 00:16:35,400
-Her again?  -Him again?

264
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:40,140
My ring!

265
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:43,500
Wait...

266
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:46,160
Someone's falling!

267
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:48,480
Be careful!

268
00:16:49,370 --> 00:16:50,460
Someone fell into the pool!

269
00:16:52,030 --> 00:16:53,340
Someone fell into the pool!

270
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:56,390
Grab this now!

271
00:16:56,570 --> 00:16:57,100
Come on!

272
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:09,450
Come on! Grab it!

273
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:20,990
Are you okay?

274
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:29,050
Of course I am!

275
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:32,900
I was Zhouhai City's freestyle champion of the junior group

276
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:35,140
back when I was a student.

277
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:36,030
Besides,

278
00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:37,740
what could happen to me

279
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:39,020
when the water's this shallow?

280
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:41,450
Stop fussing, will you!

281
00:17:53,290 --> 00:17:53,630
Hello?

282
00:17:54,290 --> 00:17:54,890
Mr. Zheng,

283
00:17:55,290 --> 00:17:57,070
you booked dinner at 7:30 p.m.

284
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:57,860
Which is now.

285
00:17:58,010 --> 00:17:59,440
Will you still be here for dinner today?

286
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:02,190
Please change it to 12 p.m. tomorrow.

287
00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:03,590
Okay, Mr. Zheng.

288
00:18:16,690 --> 00:18:17,380
Hello, Miranda.

289
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,270
Where are you, Shen Ying?

290
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:19,690
I'm on my way to get some food.

291
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:20,390
I need an article

292
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:21,900
on Black Pearl Restaurant's dishes now.

293
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:23,510
It's in that resort villa.

294
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:24,580
I've confirmed

295
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:25,800
the reservation with the manager.

296
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:26,950
Go there now.

297
00:18:27,210 --> 00:18:27,980
I'll send you the address.

298
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:29,180
Okay, I'm going there now.

299
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:36,770
[Black Pearl Restaurant]

300
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:37,740
Hello, ma'am.

301
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:38,720
Do you have a reservation?

302
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:39,260
Hello.

303
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:40,920
I'm the food editor from Isen.

304
00:18:41,530 --> 00:18:42,050
My surname is Shen.

305
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:47,410
I'm sorry, Ms. Shen.

306
00:18:47,450 --> 00:18:48,730
We made a mistake

307
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:50,360
and assigned your table to another customer.

308
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:51,260
Would it be okay

309
00:18:51,470 --> 00:18:52,780
if we change your reservation to tomorrow?

310
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:53,510
No.

311
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:54,380
This is for work.

312
00:18:54,730 --> 00:18:55,770
I have to send in the article tomorrow.

313
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:57,220
And I don't suppose

314
00:18:57,220 --> 00:18:58,680
the restaurant would delay the publicity, right?

315
00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:01,050
In that case,

316
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:02,730
since he's not with anyone else,

317
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,280
shall I go and ask him

318
00:19:04,330 --> 00:19:05,440
if he'd agree to share the table?

319
00:19:05,730 --> 00:19:06,770
Okay, thank you.

320
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:12,810
Excuse me, sir.

321
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:14,860
Would you kindly agree to share the table?

322
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:16,300
Okay.

323
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:19,950
Excuse me, ma'am.

324
00:19:20,050 --> 00:19:21,010
He agreed.

325
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:21,700
Please follow me.

326
00:19:21,730 --> 00:19:22,240
Thank you.

327
00:19:28,890 --> 00:19:29,980
-You again? -You again?

328
00:19:31,090 --> 00:19:31,900
Are you following me?

329
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:32,900
Waiter,

330
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:34,510
I won't share the table.

331
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:35,910
Please let this lady leave.

332
00:19:36,830 --> 00:19:37,860
-But... -Right, ma'am.

333
00:19:37,890 --> 00:19:38,970
I'm really very sorry.

334
00:19:40,970 --> 00:19:42,500
Sir, your cheese salad with foie gras.

335
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:43,580
And beef ribs

336
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:45,100
with bratwursts.

337
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:45,940
Go ahead.

338
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:47,220
Wait...

339
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:52,260
Excuse me, sir.

340
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:54,490
Your French lamb chop and fried mushrooms.

341
00:19:55,350 --> 00:19:56,250
That's everything now.

342
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:56,850
-Please enjoy. -Thank you.

343
00:19:57,810 --> 00:19:59,210
Mr. handsome,

344
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:01,260
I'm Isen's food editor.

345
00:20:01,570 --> 00:20:03,780
I need to take some photos

346
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:04,860
for a rush-order article today.

347
00:20:06,290 --> 00:20:06,980
Please.

348
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:08,780
I'll just take a few photos.

349
00:20:08,810 --> 00:20:10,000
Then I'll leave right away, okay?

350
00:20:11,090 --> 00:20:11,520
No.

351
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:17,700
Here's the thing.

352
00:20:18,430 --> 00:20:21,350
Actually, I got dumped recently.

353
00:20:22,570 --> 00:20:25,220
If I lose my job on top of that,

354
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:27,790
how am I going to live on?

355
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:28,220
Enough.

356
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:30,020
You win.

357
00:20:30,710 --> 00:20:31,480
Do it and leave.

358
00:20:32,370 --> 00:20:32,890
Great.

359
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:49,870
Taking photos

360
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,640
and making up some sentimental stories,

361
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:53,550
that's what being a food editor's about?

362
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:56,520
Of course I'd like to taste them myself.

363
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:57,660
Would you let me?

364
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:59,260
But judging food

365
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:00,520
based on sentimental stories

366
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:03,410
is disrespectful to the food,

367
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:05,910
and is utterly unprofessional.

368
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:07,030
Excuse me, sir,

369
00:21:07,570 --> 00:21:09,310
but I think it's up to the readers to decide.

370
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:10,500
Don't you ever think about

371
00:21:10,910 --> 00:21:12,520
those chefs who're dedicated

372
00:21:12,550 --> 00:21:13,260
to cooking?

373
00:21:13,570 --> 00:21:15,110
Is food without sentimental stories

374
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:16,760
boring and worthless?

375
00:21:17,530 --> 00:21:18,490
You underestimate gastronomy.

376
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:25,480
That is your prejudice.

377
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:27,600
I have my professional logic.

378
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:47,410
Sorry, ma'am.

379
00:21:47,950 --> 00:21:48,650
I'm sorry.

380
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:50,930
It's okay. Go ahead.

381
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:51,700
Okay.

382
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:06,050
Jinx,

383
00:22:06,730 --> 00:22:07,580
enjoy it yourself.

384
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:26,200
The ring is gone.

385
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:28,840
And now the camera too.

386
00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:30,680
Ying...

387
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,920
-All the memories gone. -I know you're upset now.

388
00:22:33,010 --> 00:22:33,570
Listen,

389
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:34,980
why don't you open the door now?

390
00:22:35,010 --> 00:22:36,780
Don't lock yourself in the room, okay?

391
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:38,660
Open the door.

392
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:44,630
Ying,

393
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:46,140
open the door

394
00:22:46,170 --> 00:22:47,820
and talk to us, okay?

395
00:22:49,050 --> 00:22:49,620
Ying.

396
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:54,720
Ying, say something.

397
00:22:58,020 --> 00:22:58,570
Ying.

398
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:03,160
Listen.

399
00:23:14,710 --> 00:23:16,210
Ying!

400
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:16,780
Ying!

401
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:18,900
Open the door!

402
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:20,060
Are you alright?

403
00:23:22,330 --> 00:23:23,600
Ying!

404
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:24,770
Ying!

405
00:23:25,050 --> 00:23:25,990
Open the door!

406
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:27,650
Say something!

407
00:23:28,210 --> 00:23:29,820
-Ying! -We're worried about you!

408
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:30,420
Ying!

409
00:23:33,670 --> 00:23:34,440
Ying!

410
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:36,020
Ying, open the door!

411
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:39,600
Let's break the door. Three, two, one...

412
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:42,920
Three, two, one...

413
00:23:48,490 --> 00:23:49,060
Let's drink.

414
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:50,240
Yes!

415
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:51,100
Yes!

416
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:51,970
Yes!

417
00:23:55,330 --> 00:23:57,560
With “Uncle" and Zhuang beside me,

418
00:23:58,620 --> 00:23:59,530
cheering me up,

419
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:02,210
I can't be the most miserable person

420
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,400
in the breakup.

421
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:08,400
But why does it still hurt so much?

422
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:13,660
It feels like this world

423
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:15,510
has suddenly assumed a strange rhythm,

424
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:19,230
slowly flowing near from all directions.

425
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:21,560
It makes me feel that...

426
00:24:22,630 --> 00:24:23,780
this world...

427
00:24:24,330 --> 00:24:26,860
exists in a different way now.

428
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:31,800
I can't understand why,

429
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:35,010
just when I thought

430
00:24:35,030 --> 00:24:37,290
I was becoming the best possible version of myself,

431
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:40,720
I'd find myself alone again.

432
00:24:59,390 --> 00:25:00,110
Xinyi.

433
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:01,800
Waking daddy up?

434
00:25:07,430 --> 00:25:07,920
Up!

435
00:25:24,550 --> 00:25:24,940
Morning.

436
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:28,180
You look good today.

437
00:25:28,310 --> 00:25:29,170
Slept well last night?

438
00:25:40,910 --> 00:25:42,100
Drink some juice. It's good for your health.

439
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:44,100
Dr Xu,

440
00:25:44,530 --> 00:25:45,730
can you send me a message

441
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:46,830
before coming here?

442
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:47,730
Why the formalities?

443
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,280
We're family. Remember?

444
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:53,510
I made this. Try it.

445
00:25:53,890 --> 00:25:55,160
It's really ugly.

446
00:25:55,260 --> 00:25:56,960
Aren't you happy to have such a good friend

447
00:25:57,110 --> 00:25:57,820
who makes breakfast for you,

448
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:58,940
brings it here and eats with you?

449
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:01,080
Can't you keep me company for a bit?

450
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:05,710
Can you speak in a normal way?

451
00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:08,280
If you could cook,

452
00:26:08,370 --> 00:26:09,690
I wouldn't need to get up so early every day.

453
00:26:10,230 --> 00:26:11,230
And I'd be scrounging free meals

454
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:12,470
all the time.

455
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:17,780
Thanks.

456
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:19,980
By the way,

457
00:26:20,410 --> 00:26:21,550
clean up Xinyi's mess for me.

458
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:24,430
Isn't that your job?

459
00:26:24,570 --> 00:26:25,340
Why is it always me?

460
00:26:29,110 --> 00:26:30,020
Zheng Xinyi,

461
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:33,290
your poop really stinks every time.

462
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:40,020
The new director is so handsome.

463
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:43,540
Everyone, pause for a second

464
00:26:43,570 --> 00:26:44,580
and come to the conference room.

465
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:46,120
I have an important announcement to make.

466
00:26:49,550 --> 00:26:51,580
A male star working nearby.

467
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:52,710
Yue, give me a pinch.

468
00:26:52,730 --> 00:26:54,040
He's the new director.

469
00:26:54,260 --> 00:26:55,450
He's said to have been appointed by the headquarters.

470
00:26:55,830 --> 00:26:57,300
He's got his silver bullet.

471
00:26:57,620 --> 00:26:59,100
The bossy kind? He's my type!

472
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:00,100
Come on. Let’s go.

473
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:04,830
Weren't she with us earlier?

474
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:05,570
Where's she?

475
00:27:05,730 --> 00:27:06,540
She went downstairs

476
00:27:06,570 --> 00:27:07,880
to welcome the new director,

477
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:09,750
to give him a good impression

478
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:10,860
of Isen.

479
00:27:11,330 --> 00:27:12,140
Hi, Director.

480
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:15,100
I'm the editor of Isen's food column.

481
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,120
My name is Shen Ying.

482
00:27:16,650 --> 00:27:17,970
To welcome the new director?

483
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:20,010
Then who was that person?

484
00:27:21,010 --> 00:27:22,790
Oh no, little fool!

485
00:27:23,170 --> 00:27:24,060
She's always late.

486
00:27:24,830 --> 00:27:25,880
I'm texting her now.

487
00:27:28,690 --> 00:27:30,090
The director's in the conference room.

488
00:27:32,850 --> 00:27:33,460
No!

489
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:34,230
Mr. Zheng Dao

490
00:27:34,570 --> 00:27:36,330
is a top-class talent

491
00:27:36,350 --> 00:27:37,430
from our headquarters in Italy.

492
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:38,660
His mission here

493
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:39,750
is to launch

494
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:41,750
and oversee the operations of our New Media Marketing Department.

495
00:27:42,010 --> 00:27:42,700
Now join me in welcoming him.

496
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:51,280
Let's get straight to the point.

497
00:27:51,730 --> 00:27:52,450
Behind me

498
00:27:52,730 --> 00:27:54,340
is Isen's work report

499
00:27:54,410 --> 00:27:55,590
for the past five years.

500
00:27:56,150 --> 00:27:57,740
It also reflects your performance in the past five years.

501
00:27:58,250 --> 00:27:59,040
Let me make this clear.

502
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:01,210
Your work in the future is very simple.

503
00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:02,780
Keep to the word “rigor”.

504
00:28:03,070 --> 00:28:04,490
Respecting the dish itself

505
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:06,940
is the key to producing good food-related content.

506
00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:14,300
Isen has become one of the best in the industry

507
00:28:14,450 --> 00:28:15,990
in the past five years.

508
00:28:17,150 --> 00:28:18,790
And this city's food industry

509
00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:21,370
is the bellwether of the country's preferences.

510
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:23,020
But here,

511
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:25,850
I don't see enough expertise in food.

512
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:27,490
Nor do I see

513
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:31,000
