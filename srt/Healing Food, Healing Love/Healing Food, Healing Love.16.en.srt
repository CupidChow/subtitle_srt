[Episode 16]

3
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:00,680
Today is the 17th day since I met Fang.

4
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:03,740
What's so special about 17?

5
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:04,690
Nothing.

6
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:06,290
On this day,

7
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:08,160
I had Fang's cooking for the first time.

8
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:10,660
Although it was not as good

9
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:12,020
as Li's,

10
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:13,500
it was delicious enough.

11
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,160
I hope to have much more of it in the future.

12
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:17,600
How is it?

13
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:19,940
Fang's cooking is not bad, right?

14
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,430
Not bad. Just so so.

15
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:23,930
Listen to yourself.

16
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:25,300
You have no manners.

17
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:29,980
I'm willing to take criticism.

18
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:33,910
Why are you taking photos if it's not good?

19
00:02:34,579 --> 00:02:35,820
I said it's not bad.

20
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:37,140
I didn't say it's not delicious.

21
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:39,550
Plus I just like this plate.

22
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:40,770
What's wrong with taking a photo?

23
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:45,990
Many chefs have come to Li's bistro.

24
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:47,250
Fang Siwei

25
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:48,880
is the first one who'd listen to me.

26
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:51,220
He's really different from other chefs.

27
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,130
It's the weekend,

28
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:55,820
and Fang is designing new dishes again.

29
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:56,790
He's humming a tune.

30
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:58,620
Looks like he's in a good humor.

31
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:29,329
How was it, Bai?

32
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:31,440
What's wrong?

00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:33,260
Aren't you usually

34
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:35,240
cheerful and saying your're liberated after a session?

35
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:37,870
She's fine.

36
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,460
She just needs some time to digest it.

37
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:41,300
Okay, thank you.

Where are the others?

46

I told them to finish up and go home,

No.

It's true that Li Bai is quite young,

but she's already an adult.

88

Making out in public.

110
00:07:56,930 --> 00:07:57,890

Everyone, send me your work in progress.

115
00:08:20,450 --> 00:08:21,500
I'll give you my feedback later.

116

Thank you.

117
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,100
Come in.

118

My new proposal in hard copy.

119
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:31,680
Care to take a look?

120
00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:32,250
Really?

121
00:08:34,419 --> 00:08:35,429
Although most media

122
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:36,460
helped clarify the scandal

123
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:37,510
during our leave,

124
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:39,549
some are still spreading gossips.

125
00:08:40,350 --> 00:08:40,919
As expected.

126
00:08:41,669 --> 00:08:43,340
Yu Sheng won't let us off easily.

If we can't stop the gossiping,

131
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:58,460
we might at least go and enjoy

some good tongues.

133
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:04,220
You're quite humorous.

Of course.

135
00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:07,770
Whoever dares to gossip again

136
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:09,300
will share the fate

138
00:09:12,450 --> 00:09:12,870
Okay.

139
00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:14,670
That'll be our theme then.

140
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:16,900
Keep up the good work.

141
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:18,140
I'm off.

142
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:18,580
Okay.

143
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:21,430
Bye.

144
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,480
Sir, long time no see.

145
00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:24,230
Welcome, Shen!

146

Come on in.

147
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,460
The duck tongues here are my favorite.

148
00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:30,540
Finally

149
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:32,210
bringing your boyfriend here for our duck tongues?

150
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:32,940
Yes.

151
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:35,220
I never brought that scumbag here.

152
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,120
So you're the first one.

153

What do you think?

158
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:41,380
Great.

159
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:42,380
What's your name?

160
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:43,760
Just call me Zheng.

161
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:45,150
The usual?

162
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:45,950
Sure.

163
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:48,100
The specialty here

164
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:49,380
is their Marinated Duck Tongues.

165
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:51,590
The owner told me about the preparation process.

166
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:52,360
Very complicated.

167
00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:53,370
So I couldn't remember it.

168
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:54,420
But the key is

169
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:55,940
the secret sauce that they use.

170
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:57,520
That's what makes them so popular.

171
00:09:57,850 --> 00:09:58,730
It's been a long time.

172
00:09:59,130 --> 00:09:59,790
It's true.

173
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:01,050

Thank you, sir.

These duck tongues

176
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:04,650
don't really look special.

177
00:10:05,290 --> 00:10:05,940
Have a try.

178
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:20,220
The taste is indeed different though.

179
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:21,630
In what way?

180
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,660
I think it's in the broth.

181
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:26,140
Usually the broth is made with pork bones.

182
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:28,020
But here they use duck bones instead.

183
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:29,300
Bingo!

184
00:10:30,950 --> 00:10:32,500
And there's radish in it,

185
00:10:32,530 --> 00:10:34,540
which gives them a subtle taste.

186
00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:35,970
I think it's a great idea.

Of course.

I'm not.

191

He's being modest, sir.

192

205
00:11:23,410 --> 00:11:24,130
Mr. Yu,

206
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:25,960
your father asked me to remind you

207

208

how many memory cards did you bring?

213
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:50,730
I brought two.

214
00:11:50,770 --> 00:11:51,280
Should be enough.

215
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:53,290
Mine is a high-pixel camera.

216
00:11:53,330 --> 00:11:54,050
I'll need four.

217

Fetch me two more.

218

Who knew it'd be you today?

219
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:01,380
Much less what camera you use.

220

I'm not obliged to report to you

221

222
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:09,550
Right, Chief Photographer?

223
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:16,930

If we're to add lamb tongue

in our guide...

231
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:38,620
Can you think of

232
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:39,750
other ways of cooking it?

233
00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:43,990
Stir-frying or saucing it

234
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:45,790
isn't creative enough.

235
00:12:46,610 --> 00:12:49,160
Lamb tongue has a strong smell,

236
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:51,340
and can't be kept for very long.

237
00:12:52,570 --> 00:12:55,580
Is there a recipe that can extend its shelf life

238
00:12:56,130 --> 00:12:58,800
and give it a good flavor at the same time?

239
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:00,980
Have you ever thought about smoking it?

240
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:02,950
Smoking it?

241
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:04,880
Marinate and stew it

242
00:13:05,310 --> 00:13:06,630
before leaving it in the broth for a night.

243

Boil it the next day.

244
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:10,730
We can smoke it with dried tangerine peel,

245
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:11,940
brown sugar and tea.

246
00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:14,020
Lamb is warm in nature.

247
00:13:14,770 --> 00:13:15,880
We can use oolong

248
00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:18,600
or black tea, both of which are similar to lamb in nature.

249
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:19,660
Good idea.

250
00:13:20,370 --> 00:13:23,480
We can use oolong in spring and summer

251
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:25,760
and black tea in autumn and winter.

252
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:26,510
Sure.

I realized

that "not delicious" isn't the opposite of "delicious,"

261
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:46,750
but a timeless component of the dish.

These were smoked with oolong.

00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,200
You're awesome!

344
00:17:12,210 --> 00:17:13,530
Way to go, Ying!

345
00:17:13,550 --> 00:17:14,190
What's making you

346
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:15,380
smile from ear to ear?

347
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:18,109
It's kind of sweet, Ms. Shen.

348
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:19,260
Let me read it to you guys.

349
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,200
Stop it.

350
00:17:20,869 --> 00:17:21,609
Congratulations!

351
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:23,950
The very first article by ShenZhangZhengYi

352
00:17:24,050 --> 00:17:25,329
has become an Isen record-breaker.

353
00:17:25,849 --> 00:17:26,369
Yes.

354
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:28,310
The editors at our partner companies are writing the same thing.

355
00:17:28,530 --> 00:17:29,610
"ShenZhangZhengYi,

356
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:31,290
unflinching and triumphant on their first go.

357
00:17:31,610 --> 00:17:33,510
We look forward to their future recommendations."

358
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:36,850
Don't you all be so kind.

359
00:17:37,010 --> 00:17:38,860
It's making me feel self-conscious.

360
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:41,430
Why don't you tell them I provided the black tea?

361
00:17:43,010 --> 00:17:43,820
Miranda says

362
00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:45,730
our biggest client

363
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:47,230
has taken note of this sensation,

364
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:49,390
and is asking to have an extra planning meeting with us.

365
00:17:49,770 --> 00:17:51,900
Everyone on the gourmet team is required to attend.

366
00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:53,280
The "biggest client"?

367
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:54,700
Yes.

368
00:17:55,050 --> 00:17:56,460
It's Shengshi Group.

369
00:18:04,490 --> 00:18:06,570
I’ll go and get prepared for the meeting.

370
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:08,250
Okay.

371
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:20,860
Please stay.

372
00:18:21,130 --> 00:18:21,820
Goodbye.

373
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:22,980
Thank you, Mr. Yu.

374
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:24,620
I won't see you out then.

375
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:32,780
I just discovered a great barbecue stall.

376
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:33,540
Yeah?

377
00:18:47,410 --> 00:18:48,000
Ms. Zhuang,

378
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:51,020
I disapprove of your relationship with Sicheng.

379
00:18:52,270 --> 00:18:53,280
Compared with you,

380
00:18:53,490 --> 00:18:54,710
Sicheng is still immature.

381
00:18:55,230 --> 00:18:57,120
He's not sophisticated enough to see the greater picture.

382
00:18:58,060 --> 00:19:00,500
I believe you are quite smart.

383
00:19:01,650 --> 00:19:02,970
If you like,

384
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:04,220
I'll introduce you

385
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,350
to other companies in China

386
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:08,450
or even abroad.

387
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:09,460
Of course,

388
00:19:10,090 --> 00:19:11,230
if you have other things on your mind,

389
00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:12,600
I'll try my best to satisfy you.

390
00:19:13,050 --> 00:19:15,500
I think you can understand

391
00:19:15,610 --> 00:19:16,890
my good intentions.

392
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:19,090
You're asking me

393
00:19:20,170 --> 00:19:21,530
to leave Yu Sicheng alone?

394
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:22,360
Yes.

395
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:24,440
Ms. Zhuang,

396
00:19:24,770 --> 00:19:25,650
no offense,

397
00:19:26,490 --> 00:19:27,950
but as Yu Sicheng's father,

398
00:19:28,730 --> 00:19:29,400
this time,

399
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:32,030
I won't let him have his way.

400
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:34,570
What do you mean?

401
00:19:35,310 --> 00:19:36,150
It was your son

402
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:37,220
who wouldn't

403
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:38,400
leave Zhuang Yan alone.

404
00:19:38,890 --> 00:19:39,450
Ms. Shen.

405
00:19:40,970 --> 00:19:41,640
Ms. Shen,

406
00:19:43,210 --> 00:19:44,380
this is a personal matter.

407
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:52,810
Zhuang.

408
00:19:54,930 --> 00:19:55,360
It's okay.

409
00:19:58,380 --> 00:19:58,980
It's okay.

410
00:20:04,890 --> 00:20:05,350
Dong,

411
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:06,410
where's Fang?

412
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:08,030
Away on business.

413
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:12,870
Okay, I'm leaving.

414
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:13,860
Not yet.

415
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:15,940
He asked me to reserve a dish for you.

416
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:16,730
Have it before you leave.

417
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:18,310
Have a seat.

418
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:22,740
What is it you want to see Fang Siwei about?

419
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:24,040
Something personal.

420
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:27,620
He's probably out for some research.

421
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:28,860
You'll have to wait for him.

422
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:33,270
Okay.

423
00:20:34,610 --> 00:20:35,110
Here.

424
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:43,740
Every part of the white fish

425
00:20:43,770 --> 00:20:44,850
is covered in fish bones.

426
00:20:45,330 --> 00:20:47,000
They're there for self-protection.

427
00:20:47,930 --> 00:20:48,850
When you taste it,

428
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:51,250
the slightest bit of rush might leave a bone stuck in your throat.

429
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:53,030
So you have to take your time

430
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:55,910
to enjoy the taste of fresh white fish.

431
00:20:58,350 --> 00:20:59,630
I advised you to cook for Li Bai.

432
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:01,020
Why did you cook for me?

433
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:02,400
What are you mumbling about?

434
00:21:03,150 --> 00:21:04,510
Nothing. Nothing.

435
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:07,020
Trust me,

436
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:07,940
delicious food

437
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:09,040
will cheer you up.

438
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:14,190
Zhuang...

439
00:21:15,430 --> 00:21:15,910
Zhuang.

440
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:31,950
Thank you.

441
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:35,120
I thought

442
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:37,210
you would sever ties with me

443
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:39,030
because of Yu Sheng.

444
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:39,890
What are you talking about?

445
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:42,040
You're a friend to us.

446
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,030
Why should that change

447
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:45,140
because of your father?

448
00:21:52,050 --> 00:21:53,060
But why is she taking it differently?

449
00:21:54,150 --> 00:21:55,780
There're differences between friendship and love.

450
00:21:57,460 --> 00:21:59,850
Sometimes, love requires a stronger sense of security.

451
00:22:02,970 --> 00:22:03,530
Go ahead.

452
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:05,100
Fish tastes better when it's hot.

453
00:22:16,990 --> 00:22:18,820
"Every part of the white fish

454
00:22:19,170 --> 00:22:20,240
is covered in fish bones.

455
00:22:21,810 --> 00:22:23,980
They're there for self-protection."

456
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:27,170
Here, Yu.

457
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:30,480
Thank you.

458
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:35,680
I'm fine.

459
00:22:40,410 --> 00:22:40,890
Yu Sicheng,

460
00:22:41,670 --> 00:22:42,660
let us tell you

461
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:44,280
a bit about Zhuang's past.

462
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:46,280
I guess she didn't.

463
00:22:49,390 --> 00:22:51,510
We went to the same university.

464
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,760
The same school, but different majors.

465
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:56,380
We got to know each other fairly late,

466
00:22:56,550 --> 00:22:57,340
but we got along right away.

467
00:22:57,900 --> 00:22:59,310
So we know a bit more about her than you do.

468
00:22:59,690 --> 00:23:00,170
I hope you don't mind.

469
00:23:01,170 --> 00:23:01,520
It's okay.

470
00:23:03,370 --> 00:23:04,310
Help fill in the blanks

471
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:05,080
where my memory fails me.

472
00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:05,640
No problem.

473
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:08,430
Zhuang grew up

474
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:11,050
in a welfare institution.

475
00:23:12,010 --> 00:23:13,250
That experience made it difficult

476
00:23:13,730 --> 00:23:16,670
for her to open her heart to others.

477
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:18,230
Later,

478
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:19,930
she was adopted by the directress there.

479
00:23:20,230 --> 00:23:20,990
When it was time for university,

480
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:23,170
she finally left the city

481
00:23:23,190 --> 00:23:24,430
that broke her heart

482
00:23:25,670 --> 00:23:26,680
and became friends with us.

483
00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:32,660
And then,

484
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:34,810
she met a guy who made her heart flutter.

485
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:37,540
Fan and I encouraged her

486
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:38,940
to be brave and court him.

487
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:42,580
They stayed happily together

488
00:23:42,770 --> 00:23:43,780
until graduation came.

489
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:46,090
At which point,

490
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:47,340
the guy's parents

491
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:48,580
wanted their son to study abroad

492
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:51,280
and get an investor visa.

493
00:23:52,530 --> 00:23:53,610
Zhuang's background

494
00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:55,410
and the will of the guy's parents

495
00:23:56,230 --> 00:23:57,560
meant that they could only separate.

496
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:06,670
The guy said he would come back to her,

497
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:10,030
but only we knew

498
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:13,100
that it was but a white lie.

499
00:24:15,490 --> 00:24:16,090
So,

500
00:24:16,690 --> 00:24:18,340
Zhuang is actually someone

501
00:24:19,010 --> 00:24:19,880
really sensitive about love.

502
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:22,520
But I believe

503
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:23,670
she just needs

504
00:24:25,050 --> 00:24:27,300
to meet someone whom she'll think is right for her.

505
00:24:32,830 --> 00:24:33,390
I see.

506
00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:36,230
I will get her back.

507
00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:39,420
I never wanted to lie to her.

508
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:44,510
You have our support.

509
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:47,480
But haste makes waste.

510
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:48,520
Take it slow.

511
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:52,230
That's right, Yu.

512
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:55,260
Rome was not built in a day.

513
00:25:02,310 --> 00:25:04,360
That's all for the review.

514
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:06,490
Thank you again for your hard work.

515
00:25:07,530 --> 00:25:09,170
In order to establish Gourmet

516
00:25:09,210 --> 00:25:11,520
as the top in the realm of food review,

517
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:13,400
this week's topic will be

518
00:25:14,070 --> 00:25:16,340
"The Person Behind 'Treasure in the Snow'".

519
00:25:17,130 --> 00:25:18,120
"Treasure in the Snow"

520
00:25:18,150 --> 00:25:19,420
is a famous Cantonese dish.

521
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:20,470
It takes much work to make,

522
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:21,440
and contains many ingredients.

523
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:23,120
The chef behind this dish

524
00:25:23,150 --> 00:25:24,510
must be a master of Cantonese cuisine.

525
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:25,500
We'll go to Guangdong.

526
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:27,610
That's the key point.

527
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:29,780
The person we're going to interview

528
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:31,200
is not a chef of Cantonese cuisine.

529
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:32,940
That's where it's curious.

530
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,680
Why is a chef who doesn't specialize in Cantonese cuisine

531
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:36,890
doing such a good job

532
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:38,250
in making a Cantonese dish

533
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:39,980
that is known for its intricacy?

534
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:42,660
So... there's a story.

535
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:44,370
Right.

536
00:25:45,090 --> 00:25:45,820
These days,

537
00:25:47,510 --> 00:25:48,630
everyone has a story.

538
00:25:55,750 --> 00:25:56,600
It'll still be

539
00:25:56,780 --> 00:25:58,780
Director Zheng and Shen Ying's project

540
00:25:58,930 --> 00:25:59,970
this week.

541
00:26:00,950 --> 00:26:01,910
That's all for now.

542
00:26:04,450 --> 00:26:05,020
Ying,

543
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:07,440
“ShenZhangZhengYi, takes you by surprise!"

544
00:26:07,570 --> 00:26:08,130
Victory!

545
00:26:09,210 --> 00:26:09,580
Victory!

546
00:26:12,310 --> 00:26:12,790
Victory.

547
00:26:31,870 --> 00:26:32,640
Let's have some fruit.

548
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:36,100
Traffic is so bad today.

549
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:38,460
Here.

550
00:26:43,250 --> 00:26:44,060
When I was little,

551
00:26:45,470 --> 00:26:46,390
every spring outing,

552
00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:48,120
my mom would prepare a box of fruit for me.

553
00:26:48,770 --> 00:26:50,760
At that time, other kids brought snacks.

554
00:26:50,790 --> 00:26:51,780
I was the only one eating fruit.

555
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:53,060
So I used to

556
00:26:53,090 --> 00:26:54,480
really envy them.

557
00:26:55,430 --> 00:26:56,430
But now,

558
00:26:57,230 --> 00:26:59,400
I think the fruit my mom prepared

559
00:26:59,430 --> 00:27:00,440
was the best.

560
00:27:00,930 --> 00:27:03,150
Because that was exclusively custom-made for me.

561
00:27:05,770 --> 00:27:06,170
What about you?

562
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:10,780
When I was little,

563
00:27:11,470 --> 00:27:12,560
my mom's best dish

564
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:13,640
was "Treasure in the Snow".

565
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:15,670
That was the best

566
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:16,930
exclusive memory of my childhood.

567
00:27:17,190 --> 00:27:17,910
What a coincidence.

568
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:19,320
What about your dad?

569
00:27:19,540 --> 00:27:20,850
What would he usually cook for you?

570
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:23,910
He...

571
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:26,040
I don't remember.

572
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:29,750
He was not a good husband or father.

573
00:27:30,390 --> 00:27:32,160
After he took over from his mentor,

574
00:27:33,550 --> 00:27:34,840
he just neglected me and my mom

575
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:38,170
until my mom died of illness.

576
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:45,640
It's said that the person we're going to interview,

577
00:27:45,690 --> 00:27:47,520
the big guy behind "Treasure in the Snow",

578
00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:48,660
has been

579
00:27:48,690 --> 00:27:51,200
sticking to the traditions of Chinese cuisine for all these years.

580
00:27:52,050 --> 00:27:53,170
From what I read online,

581
00:27:53,190 --> 00:27:55,450
he likes to use simple cooking methods,

582
00:27:55,990 --> 00:27:56,890
deluxe ingredients

583
00:27:57,030 --> 00:27:58,510
and elegant ornaments

584
00:27:58,750 --> 00:28:00,000
to represent Chinese cuisine.

585
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:02,380
I think he must be

586
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:04,280
a warm and loving person

587
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:06,290
to be able to achieve perfection

588
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:07,500
in simple dishes.

589
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:22,510
"You Wei"?

590
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:25,590
[You Wei]

591
00:28:27,170 --> 00:28:27,870
"You Wei"?

592
00:28:32,770 --> 00:28:34,240
Come on, Zheng Dao.

593
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:41,730
Hello.

594
00:28:42,490 --> 00:28:43,200
Hello, sir.

595
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:44,460
I'm Isen's editor, Shen Ying.

596
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:45,870
Hello, I'm Zheng Youwei.

597
00:28:46,410 --> 00:28:47,410
Here's my card.

598
00:28:49,770 --> 00:28:51,700
This is Zheng Dao, Director at Isen.

599
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:57,820
So it's... Director Zheng?

600
00:28:59,810 --> 00:29:00,610
I see.

601
00:29:01,410 --> 00:29:03,250
Nice to meet you.

602
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:13,650
I'm only realizing now that you share the surname Zheng.

603
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:14,910
What a coincidence!

604
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:15,760
Yes, indeed.

605
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:18,350
That makes us family.

606
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:23,320
Sir,

607
00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:24,270
we're here today

608
00:29:24,290 --> 00:29:25,700
to interview you

609
00:29:25,730 --> 00:29:27,700
about your "Treasure in the Snow".

610
00:29:28,650 --> 00:29:29,280
I see.

611
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:31,690
Why don't you have a seat first?

612
00:29:32,170 --> 00:29:33,900
I'll go and make it for you now.

613
00:29:34,330 --> 00:29:36,330
And we can talk about it

614
00:29:36,890 --> 00:29:37,530
while you try it.

615
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:39,920
That would be great.

616
00:29:39,970 --> 00:29:40,880
Thank you, sir.

617
00:29:41,310 --> 00:29:41,810
Please.

618
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:42,860
Okay.

619
00:29:52,450 --> 00:29:53,060
Mr. Zheng,

620
00:29:53,170 --> 00:29:54,060
you look happy today.

621
00:29:54,090 --> 00:29:54,570
Of course.

622
00:29:54,850 --> 00:29:56,970
Always nice to meet the person most important to you!

623
00:29:58,050 --> 00:29:59,560
Now go and prepare "Treasure in the Snow".

624
00:29:59,910 --> 00:30:00,250
Okay.

625
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:05,990
What's wrong?

626
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:08,140
You're not normally like this during interviews.

627
00:30:10,930 --> 00:30:12,380
Is it because of

628
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:14,070
our conversation in the car?

629
00:30:14,310 --> 00:30:14,710
No.

630
00:30:15,890 --> 00:30:16,510
Don't worry.

631
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:17,790
I'm sorry.

632
00:30:18,370 --> 00:30:19,530
I wasn't managing my emotions well.

633
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:22,700
That's not what I meant.

634
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:24,670
Let's focus on the interview now,

635
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,380
and not dwell on those sad things.

636
00:30:27,490 --> 00:30:27,820
Okay.

637
00:30:30,090 --> 00:30:31,630
Here comes "Treasure in the Snow".

638
00:30:48,070 --> 00:30:48,710
Please excuse me.

639
00:30:48,890 --> 00:30:50,130
This is part of my job.

640
00:30:50,150 --> 00:30:51,010
It's okay. Go ahead.

641
00:30:56,590 --> 00:30:57,140
Have a taste.

642
00:30:59,570 --> 00:31:00,610
Please.

643
00:31:04,890 --> 00:31:07,010
No wonder this restaurant gets tons of compliments.

644
00:31:07,130 --> 00:31:08,700
The ingredients are top grade.

645
00:31:09,470 --> 00:31:09,890
Yes.

646
00:31:10,290 --> 00:31:13,210
The ingredients determine the quality ceiling of the dish.

647
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:19,310
The chef’s character determines the floor.
