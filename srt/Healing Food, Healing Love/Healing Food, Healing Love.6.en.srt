[Episode 6]

3
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:38,509
Hello, welcome.

4
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:39,810
Do you have any reservations?

5
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:41,130
No.

6
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:42,570
Need Two rooms.

7
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:44,190
Two rooms?

8
00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:45,479
Are you sure need two?

9
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:47,820
The most recent Valentine's Day tourist season.

10
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:49,120
Resources are tight.

11
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,170
Don't get me wrong.

12
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,640
We are just colleagues.

13
00:01:52,970 --> 00:01:53,400
OK.

14
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:55,229
Please show me your ID.

15
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:08,060
No wonder the receptionist

16
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:09,820
determine if we're going to live separately.

17
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:11,900
It's so romantic.

18
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:15,100
Well,

19
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:16,329
Take a rest early.

20
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,400
You too.

21
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:47,860
My first business trip with my male boss.

22
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:49,750
Even opening a Love Hotel.

23
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:51,980
If word gets out,

24
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:53,810
my brilliant reputation will not be ruined.

25
00:02:57,970 --> 00:02:59,860
He doesn't like women anyway.

26
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:02,010
Everyone knows that.

27
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:04,110
Forget it.

28
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:05,210
There's nothing going on.

29
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:14,140
Hello?

30
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:15,300
Ying Ying Zi,

31
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:17,100
how dare you ignore my video?

32
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:17,779
Tell me.

33
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:19,600
Have you done anything bad with Zheng Dao?

34
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:20,380
That's why you dare not show me.

35
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:21,730
Tell me the truth.

36
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:26,010
Are you crazy?

37
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:27,530
Director Zheng,

38
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,410
Keep your body as jade for your boyfriend.

39
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:30,660
You even Stay at the Love Hotel.

40
00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:32,690
Are you willing to sleep in separate rooms with your female colleage.

41
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:35,450
Damn it. Slapped in the face.

42
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:36,710
Wait.

43
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:38,580
I know the base.

44
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:39,570
I've never failed.

45
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:42,700
So,

46
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:44,220
Don't forget 20 packs of spicy strips.

47
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:45,380
You lost this time.

48
00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:47,600
I'll tell you, the world is dangerous.

49
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:48,550
Be careful when you see people.

50
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:51,740
My manuscript.

51
00:04:59,270 --> 00:04:59,820
Oh no.

52
00:05:00,450 --> 00:05:01,670
What about my manuscript?

53
00:05:07,010 --> 00:05:08,240
He should have brought a computer too.

54
00:05:17,690 --> 00:05:18,300
What's wrong?

55
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:19,490
It's an emergency.

56
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:28,070
What are you looking at?

57
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:30,960
Come in first.

58
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:38,560
What's wrong with you?

59
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:40,990
My computer fell into the water.

60
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:42,340
I want to borrow your computer.

61
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:43,060
I'm in a hurry.

62
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:45,620
I still have work to do.

63
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:46,409
Hold on.

64
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,310
I'll call the waiter.

65
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:48,340
Okay.

66
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:55,960
Hello?

67
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:57,220
Room 409, please open the door.

68
00:05:58,220 --> 00:05:58,890
I'm in Room 408.

69
00:05:59,210 --> 00:05:59,610
Thank you.

70
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:03,680
The waiter will be here soon.

71
00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:07,050
Well,

72
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:27,330
You can't turn it on.

73
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:29,010
It'll burn.

74
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:30,610
What should I do now?

75
00:06:32,890 --> 00:06:33,670
Use mine.

76
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:37,780
You can use it.

77
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:39,560
Thank you, Director.

78
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,070
Hate.

79
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:54,240
Is it itchy?

80
00:06:56,330 --> 00:06:57,170
So bored.

81
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:04,220
Who is my baby?

82
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,590
I'm your treasure.

83
00:07:13,410 --> 00:07:14,690
Stop it.

84
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:16,100
Are you tickling?

85
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:16,740
Itchy?

86
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:19,540
Right,

87
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:20,660
I just boiled some boiling water.

88
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:21,900
Do you want some coffee?

89
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:22,660
It's itchy. I like it.

90
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:23,500
Let me do it.

91
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:25,070
I was a little sleepy.

92
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:28,700
It's not funny.

93
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:29,820
It's not funny.

94
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:31,300
Let's change another one.

95
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:43,020
Yours. Thank you.

96
00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:45,890
Are you okay?

97
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:48,550
Let me see.

98
00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:49,790
It's okay.

99
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:50,390
It's okay.

100
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,490
This bed is...

101
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:05,960
It's normal for a Love Hotel to have a bed like this.

102
00:08:07,890 --> 00:08:09,210
You're quite an expert.

103
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:09,710
I...

104
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:16,030
Didn't you come with your boyfriend?

105
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:17,180
Boyfriend?

106
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:21,050
Stop pretending.

107
00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:22,420
I know your secrets.

108
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:24,530
We are sisters.

109
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:26,080
Don't be shy.

110
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:27,400
Who told you that?

111
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:28,300
I'm not.

112
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:30,530
Don't worry.

113
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:33,690
I always keep my mouth shut.

114
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:35,130
I won't say anything irresponsible.

115
00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:38,360
And I can understand you.

116
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:47,180
I can prove it now, I'm not.

117
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:48,750
Do you want to give it a try?

118
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:57,770
Hello.

119
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:04,490
Hello.

120
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:06,020
Do you need to open the door?

121
00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:06,250
Yes.

122
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:07,020
The guest is here.

123
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:11,390
It's open.

124
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:16,220
Thank you, Director.

125
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:36,050
Editor's Request.

126
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:37,250
No, no. Director, you first.

127
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:38,120
Editor's Request.

128
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:39,300
Please.

129
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:46,840
Wait.

130
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:51,580
Director Zheng.

131
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:52,460
Shen Ying.

132
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:57,140
Aren't you two on a business trip together?

133
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:58,290
Why are you here so soon?

134
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:00,900
You're quite professional.

135
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:14,440
Take off your sunglasses.

136
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:20,060
Tell me the truth.

137
00:10:20,530 --> 00:10:22,100
What's wrong with

138
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:23,970
this same dark eye?

139
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:26,680
You think we're going on a trip?

140
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:29,280
We're going to work overnight, okay?

141
00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:31,610
Don't talk nonsense.

142
00:10:32,450 --> 00:10:33,010
It's true.

143
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:35,330
I watched the video of Shin Young and Director Zheng.

144
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:36,580
They liked a lot.

145
00:10:37,410 --> 00:10:38,220
I saw it too.

146
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:41,190
I thought there was something

147
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:42,980
is a trick.

148
00:10:45,690 --> 00:10:47,880
A man and a woman are in the same room.

149
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:50,000
He didn't do anything to you.

150
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:51,810
I didn't find anything.

151
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:53,460
Looks like you won.

152
00:10:54,930 --> 00:10:56,370
I ordered ten packs of spicy strips.

153
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:57,700
Yeah!

154
00:10:59,270 --> 00:11:00,230
He's not.

155
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:02,700
No.

156
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:05,240
Didn't you work all night?

157
00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:07,450
What did you do?

158
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:08,940
Shut up.

159
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:11,380
Anyway, he's not...

160
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:20,660
Something's wrong with her.

161
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,270
How strange is she?

162
00:11:30,210 --> 00:11:31,890
Do you know why no one loves you?

163
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:32,260
I'm so jealous.

164
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:34,700
Because you've never had a medium-sized osmanthus wine.

165
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:36,270
I'm so happy.

166
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:37,980
Grandpa is nice to Grandma.

167
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:38,460
Yes.

168
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:39,940
I believe in love again.

169
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:41,900
What I missing is not a grandpa who loves his wife,

170
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:42,860
but

171
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:44,740
who can wait for 19 years.

172
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:45,740
So happy.

173
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,430
Come with me.

174
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:57,060
This is the place.

175
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:03,600
Our Athan has finally risen again.

176
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,680
It's all thanks to the head of the Internet department, Shen Yingniu.

177
00:12:08,070 --> 00:12:10,820
We've developed from a paper media.

178
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:13,030
we're really a big shot in the industry.

179
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:15,110
I can't talk.

180
00:12:15,410 --> 00:12:17,930
It's because Shin Ying and Director Zheng

181
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:18,930
You're a good leader.

182
00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:20,570
Look, everyone.

183
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,330
We're trending on Weibo again.

184
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:24,390
Take a look.

185
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:25,290
Take a look.

186
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:27,650
As the hot topic of 520,

187
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:29,350
Grandma Huiyan's story became popular first.

188
00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:31,890
The bridge in Jiangnan

189
00:12:32,010 --> 00:12:33,140
Grandma's Bluestone Slate.

190
00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:35,160
as a keyword for the warm-up article,

191
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:37,580
the hot search for the coming Valentine's Day

192
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:39,780
With the integration of self-media,

193
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:42,860
Athan Magazine is back to its peak

194
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:45,380
and back to the industry benchmark.

195
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:46,340
I believe in love again.

196
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:47,620
Everyone is happy.

197
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:49,540
Only two of us

198
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,640
are in a strange embarrassment.

199
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:53,160
Shin Young.

200
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:54,800
the warm-up is perfect.

201
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:57,140
What are you going to shoot

202
00:12:57,260 --> 00:12:58,110
on Valentine's Day?

203
00:12:59,530 --> 00:13:00,740
The director hasn't spoken yet.

204
00:13:00,890 --> 00:13:02,100
So I don't know yet.

205
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:04,750
Shin Young.

206
00:13:05,070 --> 00:13:06,650
You used to have a lot of ideas.

207
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:09,060
Why do you listen to Director Zheng now?

208
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:09,540
That's right.

209
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:09,980
Did I?

210
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:11,100
What are you talking about?

211
00:13:13,490 --> 00:13:14,050
Excuse me.

212
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:17,010
Come with me.

213
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:19,130
Okay.

214
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:22,300
Alright.

215
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:24,460
Let's review

216
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:25,010
next quarter.

217
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:31,260
A coffee from a friend.
Thank you, Director.

218
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:33,580
Have a seat.

219
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:40,660
By the way,

220
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:42,740
you did a good job

221
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:43,880
in last Valentine's Day.

222
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:44,980
Thank you, Director.

223
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:50,140
The same thing hasn't been solved yet.

224
00:13:50,210 --> 00:13:52,260
I want to use her popularity

225
00:13:52,810 --> 00:13:54,410
and another Bell Story.

226
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:55,320
What do you think?

227
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:56,190
Okay.

228
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:57,900
We can help Granny Jin find someone.

229
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:02,540
If it's still hot,

230
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:03,850
you can also remedied

231
00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:05,540
The Last Word of Mouth

232
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:10,900
Right,

233
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:13,180
my colleagues said you're pretty.

234
00:14:13,330 --> 00:14:14,160
and good at acting.

235
00:14:14,510 --> 00:14:15,330
Don't tell me

236
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:17,790
you want me to do it again?

237
00:14:19,070 --> 00:14:21,360
We don't have the budget of actors this time.

238
00:14:22,370 --> 00:14:23,650
What a good plan.

239
00:14:25,210 --> 00:14:26,610
So you agree?

240
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:34,820
Give it a try.

241
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:38,870
Try it.

242
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:40,490
Don't waste your talent.

243
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:43,140
Actually, I want to say

244
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:45,460
I'm sorry about that night.

245
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:46,380
I'm sorry.

246
00:14:46,730 --> 00:14:47,500
Don't take it to heart.

247
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:51,780
What is it?

248
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:55,260
Did something happen that night?

249
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:55,980
I don't remember.

250
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:01,980
Thank you for the coffee.

251
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:04,300
What is it?

252
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:05,580
Why can't I remember?

253
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:07,130
What is it?

254
00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:13,920
The story I'm going to tell today

255
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:16,610
is the story of Jin Ringzi and Master Jin.

256
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:19,740
I never thought

257
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:21,230
half a century ago,

258
00:15:21,390 --> 00:15:22,660
a small steamed bun

259
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:24,630
can tolerate such a charming love,

260
00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:28,250
most things in the world will fade.

261
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:32,220
But perhaps the wait across the sea will not

262
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:34,420
I hope Grandma Jin

263
00:15:34,690 --> 00:15:36,580
can wait for the person who took her time.

264
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:39,620
He will come back with his promise.

265
00:15:40,850 --> 00:15:42,450
[Miss Jin]

266
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:57,860
You’re good at it.

267
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:00,580
This is just the beginning.

268
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:03,890
There's a big show coming up.

269
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:04,970
A big show?

270
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:07,940
My head hurts.

271
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:20,730
Hello, Director Jin.

272
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:22,060
Lin Man.

273
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:25,180
This is a great publicity remedy for you.

274
00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:27,470
It's very effective here.

275
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:30,260
I see.

276
00:16:31,010 --> 00:16:31,980
I'm glad you're satisfied.

277
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:34,780
This is the remedy plan we came up with.

278
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:36,220
Besides,

279
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:37,900
this is just the beginning.

280
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:39,330
There will be a big show later.

281
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:41,380
That end,

282
00:16:41,530 --> 00:16:42,420
I can beat it up tomorrow.

283
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:43,640
Okay, thank you, Director Jin.

284
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:45,020
Don't worry about,

285
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,860
Working with our athen

286
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:48,180
I won't let you down.

287
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:48,970
OK.

288
00:16:55,610 --> 00:16:56,380
You...

289
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:10,619
Hello?

290
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:10,920
Hello?

291
00:17:11,369 --> 00:17:12,020
Where are they?

292
00:17:13,410 --> 00:17:15,670
Didn't we say to arrange 30 people for me?

293
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:16,540
Yes.

294
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:17,690
Why is no one here?

295
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:18,700
Isn't it evening?

296
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:19,500
It's evening.

297
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:21,180
It's all arranged for you.

298
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:21,819
8 p.m.

299
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:26,500
How could I be talking about night?

300
00:17:46,090 --> 00:17:46,820
Are you going to confess your love?

301
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:47,580
It's quite romantic.

302
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:49,380
With whom?

303
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:57,010
What are you doing?

304
00:17:57,380 --> 00:17:58,650
Company prohibits open fire.

305
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:03,260
This is an electronic candle.

306
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:04,220
Can't you see?

307
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:05,420
In my eyes,

308
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:06,730
candles are an open fire.

309
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:08,180
So unlucky.

310
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:15,220
I've put up with you for a long time.

311
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:16,520
Brother, I'm sorry.

312
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:17,340
This is my apprentice.

313
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:18,060
He's new here. He's so immature.

314
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:18,950
I'll take him away now.

315
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:19,540
Hurry up.

316
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:20,420
Master.

317
00:18:21,170 --> 00:18:21,500
Let's go.

318
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:22,700
Sorry.

319
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:24,260
Don't take it.

320
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:25,140
Alright.

321
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:25,780
Stop watching.

322
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:26,620
Go to work.

323
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:27,420
Let's go.

324
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:31,900
Yu Si Cheng.

325
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:32,620
What are you doing?

326
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:33,300
This is the company.

327
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:34,580
I don't have time to play with you.

328
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:35,420
I'm not.

329
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:37,040
I like you.

330
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:37,940
I want you to be with me.

331
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:39,050
I want you to be my girlfriend.

332
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:39,850
You're young.

333
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:42,060
I don't like you.

334
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:42,970
I know.

335
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:45,050
But love can be cultivated.

336
00:18:48,490 --> 00:18:49,460
Bullshit.

337
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:52,090
Zhuang Xian.

338
00:18:52,290 --> 00:18:53,390
I must catch up with you.

339
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:54,260
Wherever you go,

340
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:55,190
the sea will wither and rot.

341
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:56,180
Never give up

342
00:18:56,330 --> 00:18:58,090
Persistence is victory.

343
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:02,380
Here's the milk tea.

344
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:07,370
Sure.

345
00:19:09,290 --> 00:19:10,420
Here you are. My goodness.

346
00:19:10,690 --> 00:19:13,570
Xiao Yu, you really win my heart.

347
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:16,220
It's too sinful to drink this.

348
00:19:21,290 --> 00:19:21,980
Comfortable.

349
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:23,710
Master.

350
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:24,240
Thank you.

351
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:26,820
You can't skip milk tea every day.

352
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:39,660
Have you asked Granny Jin?

353
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:41,380
About there's no second shot plan for this time,

354
00:19:42,310 --> 00:19:43,470
I've told Granny Jin.

355
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:44,460
She was very happy.

356
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:46,660
She said she would cook

357
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:47,340
all the dishes Grandpa  likes.

358
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:48,580
That's why I practice every day.

359
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:50,300
What about Master Jin?

360
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:51,820
Does he agree to have a meeting

361
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:52,420
in front of his shop?

362
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:53,750
Of course he agreed.

363
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:55,660
This is a good chance to give you two good advertisement.

364
00:19:59,770 --> 00:20:00,210
Shin Young.

365
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:01,050
I have something to tell you.

366
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:01,660
Come here.

367
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:04,100
What's wrong, Director?

368
00:20:07,770 --> 00:20:08,860
Why are you so mysterious?

369
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:12,420
An old man contacted me

370
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:14,750
He showed me his photo

371
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:15,860
when he was young with Jin Lingzi

372
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:17,530
I've checked

373
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:18,710
It's really Jinzi.

374
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:20,860
She's in Singapore now

375
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:22,250
She plans to come back next week

376
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:24,200
I'll meet Jin Lingzi for the second time

377
00:20:24,310 --> 00:20:25,150
Really?

378
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:27,980
But after a while,

379
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:29,180
his son contacted me again.

380
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:31,020
He said he was too old

381
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:32,140
and didn't want him to come back.

382
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:33,130
He also said

383
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:34,740
after so many years,

384
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:36,980
There's no need to see him.

385
00:20:37,410 --> 00:20:38,340
Why?

386
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:40,010
Why should he decide for grandpa?

387
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:41,410
Grandpa wanted to come.

388
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:43,190
But he's his guardian.

389
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:46,010
Is there really nothing we can do?

390
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:49,060
His family is quite tough.

391
00:20:49,090 --> 00:20:49,890
Don't want him to come.

392
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:55,140
What's wrong?

393
00:20:57,860 --> 00:20:59,420
It's all because the old man's son

394
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:00,780
doesn't want him to come.

395
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:01,960
Tell me.

396
00:21:02,210 --> 00:21:03,690
Shin Young has promised Jin Grandma.

397
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:05,300
She must be very sad now.

398
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:06,480
More importantly,

399
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:08,260
it makes us break our promise.

400
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:10,020
You talk too much.

401
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:11,220
I'm not wrong.

402
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:12,150
Why don't you let

403
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:14,860
that old man's son

404
00:21:15,050 --> 00:21:17,020
thinks he's not feeling well.

405
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:19,580
He's worried something might happen if he comes back.

406
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:23,140
And the nurse is not here.

407
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:25,020
He can't take care of him alone.

408
00:21:26,670 --> 00:21:28,460
Nothing is difficult in the world.

409
00:21:37,530 --> 00:21:37,980
Uncle.

410
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:43,460
Uncle.

411
00:21:43,910 --> 00:21:44,940
Is it aired this weekend?

412
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:45,620
Yes.

413
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:46,860
Can you adjust it?

414
00:21:48,770 --> 00:21:49,370
What's wrong?

415
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:51,340
She means

416
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:53,700
the old man's son can't take care of him alone.

417
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:55,100
All of Us aired Togther,

418
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:55,690
OK.

419
00:21:58,740 --> 00:21:59,580
That's what I mean.

420
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:02,460
So, Mr. Zhuang...

421
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:04,860
Alright.

422
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:07,390
We've worked together at the airport.

423
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:09,460
I'll talk to the airline company.

424
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:11,170
Make sure the old man in on the plane,

425
00:22:11,170 --> 00:22:12,180
will be given special care.

426
00:22:13,690 --> 00:22:14,730
Sure.

427
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:16,100
Me too.

428
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:18,080
I can take care of the whole process.

429
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:21,670
I really love every one of you.

430
00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:27,300
But...

431
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:28,440
Don't worry.

432
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:30,460
I'll talk to his son.

433
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:31,620
I'm 80% sure.

434
00:22:32,290 --> 00:22:34,130
Master, you are so nice.

435
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:37,860
To be honest,

436
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:39,580
I'm really touched.

437
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:52,370
Lin Man,

438
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:55,260
What's your Athen this time?

439
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:56,740
It's been two hours, right?

440
00:22:57,140 --> 00:22:58,300
My shop is still open.

441
00:22:58,300 --> 00:22:59,260
I have to do business.

442
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:00,700
You know what our Athen do,

443
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:01,740
is always trustworthy.

444
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:04,540
Isn't there a saying that good food is not afraid of late?

445
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:05,740
Please calm down.

446
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:06,940
Give us some time.

447
00:23:07,090 --> 00:23:07,620
Hold on.

448
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:10,300
What happened?

449
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:12,100
Dad, don't worry.

450
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:13,310
Auntie will definitely wait for you.

451
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:15,620
Yes, grandpa.

452
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:16,280
Don't worry.

453
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:17,220
Today, even the back.

454
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:18,100
I'll carry you on my back too.

455
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:19,900
Okay, thank you.

456
00:23:23,230 --> 00:23:23,690
Brother.

457
00:23:24,130 --> 00:23:24,730
This Money.

458
00:23:26,770 --> 00:23:27,110
Grandpa.

459
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:27,840
I have an idea.

460
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:28,540
Come with me.

461
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:31,050
Child.

462
00:23:31,690 --> 00:23:32,820
Thank you.

463
00:23:33,570 --> 00:23:34,980
Thank you so much.

464
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:36,980
Thank you.

465
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:38,180
Thank you.

466
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:40,460
The circle is impermanent.

467
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:43,110
It's all in the past.

468
00:23:44,730 --> 00:23:46,660
If he can't come today...

469
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:47,540
It's okay.

470
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:49,620
Isn't that the meaning of parting?

471
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:52,050
Grandma!

472
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:53,500
Jin Grandma!

473
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:55,980
Grandma, look who's here.

474
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:46,720
I'm back.

475
00:24:46,930 --> 00:24:48,040
I'm glad you're back.

476
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:08,610
Hello, Master Jin.

477
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:10,860
Grandma.

478
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:12,740
It was my fault.

479
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:17,340
I failed to inherit my own delicacy.

480
00:25:19,330 --> 00:25:20,140
I’m really sorry.

481
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:22,940
You are a good boy.

482
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:25,700
I will hand it over to you.

483
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:27,220
I'm so relieved.

484
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:35,290
Young man, come on. Do your best.

485
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:46,420
Thank you.

486
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:54,700
Cheers!

487
00:25:58,840 --> 00:25:59,300

Cheers.

497
00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:15,220
Thank you, Mr. Fang.
Cheers.

498
00:26:15,250 --> 00:26:15,860
You’re welcome.

499
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:20,460
I haven’t introduced

500
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:22,140

I hope everyone will take care much later.

504
00:26:27,810 --> 00:26:28,260
No problem.

505
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:29,660
I came here

506
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:30,980
to help you today.

507
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:33,900
And I'm a fan of Shin Young.

508
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:36,850
My goodness.

509
00:26:36,890 --> 00:26:39,100
Our Fans is so small now.

510
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:42,420
That means we're still young.

511
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:44,410
Don't flatter yourself.

512
00:26:45,970 --> 00:26:47,450
A Commitment Spanning Half a century,

513
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:49,270
waiting for a lifetime.

514
