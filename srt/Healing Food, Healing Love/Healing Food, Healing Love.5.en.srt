[Episode 5]

3
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:36,979
Baby.

4
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:37,900
You are at home.

5
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:38,660
Yes.

6
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:41,270
So many packages have arrived.

7
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:42,110
Is there mine?

8
00:01:42,130 --> 00:01:43,570
Yes, have a look.

9
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:45,970
Wow, my razor.

10
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,820
-Is that my Valentines gift? -Yes.

11
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:55,780
Fan Jian.

12
00:01:55,850 --> 00:01:56,660
Director Zheng.

13
00:01:58,390 --> 00:01:58,710
You two...

14
00:01:58,759 --> 00:01:59,120
You two...

15
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:05,230
Director Zheng

16
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:07,350
took me back to pick up a parcel,

17
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:09,150
and borrowed the bathroom.

18
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:11,070
This is my uncle.

19
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:12,610
It's not what you think.

20
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:25,390
Just stop here.

21
00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:25,890
No need to see me off.

22
00:02:27,329 --> 00:02:28,329
I'm not here to see you off.

23
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:29,930
I'm here to remind you.

24
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:32,700
There are many sexual harassment cases recently.

25
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,200
You need to keep a distance from the female employees.

26
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:36,329
I think you misunderstood.

27
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:37,680
I'm here for work.

28
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:39,180
Let me remind you one more thing.

29
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:41,100
As Shen Ying's uncle,

30
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:42,990
I want to remind you that my cousin is single.

31
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:46,160
What about Director Zheng this year?

32
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:58,320
What I said just now was what I saw with my own eyes.

33
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,270
Everything I said is true.

34
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,550
They are not in a relationship?

35
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:01,590
Who would believe that?

36
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,640
Really,

37
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:04,370
Ying,

38
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:06,990
you just tell your uncle the truth.

39
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:08,870
Did he threaten you

40
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:09,640
with unspoken rules in the workplace?

41
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:12,110
What?

42
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:13,550
Ying,

43
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:15,560
Why don't you announce your relationship?

44
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:16,510
It's okay.

45
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,030
You don't need to care about my feelings.

46
00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:19,270
I can understand.

47
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:22,720
Don't try to be a matchmaker.

48
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:23,520
You said Zheng and I,

49
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:26,000
the director and I,

50
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:27,720
you might as well say

51
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:31,900
Yu Sicheng and I are in a relationship, which is more trustworthy.

52
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:34,790
Master,

53
00:03:35,079 --> 00:03:36,310
I'm loyal to you.

54
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:37,550
Go away.

55
00:03:37,829 --> 00:03:38,140
Okay.

56
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:39,990
Anyway,

57
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:41,200
stop talking nonsense.

58
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:43,110
I just got along with the director peacefully.

59
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:43,740
and didn't fight.

60
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:45,100
If you beat him too hard,

61
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:46,270
he will trouble me.

62
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:48,390
He's not trying to threaten you with unspoken rules in the workplace.

63
00:03:49,490 --> 00:03:50,650
Then do I put him in the wrong?

64
00:03:51,079 --> 00:03:52,400
You indeed put him in the wrong.

65
00:03:52,579 --> 00:03:53,860
He has no affection for me.

66
00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:54,890
That's not right.

67
00:03:55,390 --> 00:03:56,630
Why did he find fault with you?

68
00:03:58,410 --> 00:03:58,890
Exactly.

69
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,520
What's the biggest feature of a straight man?

70
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:04,490
The more you like someone,

71
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:06,340
the more you want to bully her

72
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:07,410
and attract her attention.

73
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:09,450
That makes sense.

74
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,280
Since everyone is here,

75
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:26,910
I want to make an announcement.

76
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:28,110
May 20th is coming.

77
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:29,730
We're going to make a special issue on Valentine's Day.

78
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:32,110
I hope you can go around

79
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:33,480
and choose some good streets.

80
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,350
It's best to show

81
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:36,510
the most romantic food in this city.

82
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,600
I'll personally follow up the Middle Street project.

83
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:39,930
Who is with me?

84
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:49,630
I have another case to follow.

85
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:50,330
I'm busy.

86
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:53,110
The project of Central Street is urgent.

87
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:54,190
You follow this project.

88
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:56,800
Okay.

89
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,159
Director Zheng, someone is looking for you.

90
00:04:59,300 --> 00:04:59,990
Xinyi's dad,

91
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:03,720
You know, Xinyi scratched me the whole morning.

92
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:04,500
I'm so annoyed.

93
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,150
I made you breakfast.

94
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:07,950
There's coffee inside.

95
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:09,260
It is made of fresh beans.

96
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,250
You must drink it all.

97
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:10,730
Thank you.

98
00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:17,250
Have you all had enough rest?

99
00:05:20,030 --> 00:05:20,470
Let me see you off.

100
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:20,800
Okay.

101
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,760
What's going on?

102
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:26,390
Ying,

103
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:29,520
It seems that things are different.

104
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:32,960
There's a competitor.

105
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:36,770
I bet ten packs of spicy strips.

106
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,470
They must be a couple.

107
00:05:39,909 --> 00:05:40,790
I raise stakes.

108
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:43,990
But from my years of experience,

109
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I don't think they are.

110
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:48,390
Why don't we take this opportunity

111
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:49,800
to ask around?

112
00:05:51,290 --> 00:05:52,370
I also want to know.

113
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:58,070
I said no problem.

114
00:05:58,140 --> 00:05:58,790
I'll do it.

115
00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:00,370
I'll ask around for you later.

116
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:03,490
Alright, get to work.

117
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:07,370
Afternoon tea is coming.

118
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:08,680
Afternoon tea?

119
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:09,390
Today we have afternoon tea?

120
00:06:10,690 --> 00:06:11,070
Thank you.

121
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:11,750
Well done.

122
00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:12,280
Help me hand them out.

123
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:13,190
Thank you.

124
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:19,510
Afternoon tea is coming.

125
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:23,640
Thank you.

126
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:24,640
Ying,

127
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,960
He even takes away my takeout job.

128
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,760
Will I be fired?

129
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,120
No.

130
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:33,280
As a rich second generation, he's just for fun here.

131
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:34,060
He won't stay long.

132
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:36,840
Just for fun.

133
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:37,310
Thanks.

134
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:39,200
Give him two cups.

135
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:40,070
You are such a boy crazy.

136
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:40,950
Go back to work.

137
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:46,350
Ying,

138
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:48,550
you weren't there when I ordered.

139
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:49,620
I ordered five cups of the same.

140
00:06:49,690 --> 00:06:50,860
No, five cups are different.

141
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:51,560
Help yourself.

142
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:52,330
Give me the rest.

143
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:54,159
No, you can drink it all.

144
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:58,320
Yu, you're too sensible.

145
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:00,160
You don't have to spend so much money anymore.

146
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,550
This is what Yu should do.

147
00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:03,940
Ying,

148
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,260
I just want to ask

149
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:06,880
what my master favors.

150
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:09,300
-Zhuang likes... -About Zhuang

151
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:11,140
I know more than her.

152
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,200
Ask me.

153
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:13,550
Ask him.

154
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:15,240
Then you drink first.

155
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:16,000
Tell me if you need more.

156
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:17,100
Thank you, Yu.

157
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:19,390
Here you are, Tong.

158
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:23,630
Uncle.

159
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:30,760
Drink it.

160
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:33,950
Be careful. It's hot.

161
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:42,630
Uncle.

162
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:50,550
Uncle.

163
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:53,360
So what does my master like?

164
00:07:57,170 --> 00:07:58,020
There are two more boxes tomorrow.

165
00:07:58,420 --> 00:07:59,340
I'll bring them all to you.

166
00:08:02,130 --> 00:08:02,720
Thank you.

167
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:11,100
Master, is everything going well?

168
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:13,330
Master, take me with you next time.

169
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,360
Go away.

170
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:15,420
Don't follow me.

171
00:08:15,450 --> 00:08:16,540
Master.

172
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:29,210
Zhuang Yan is a photographer.

173
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:32,210
Her equipment is usually big and heavy.

174
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:35,059
What do you think she needs?

175
00:08:37,330 --> 00:08:38,490
I understand.

176
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:39,830
Master! Master! Master!

177
00:08:40,049 --> 00:08:40,720
Be careful.

178
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:41,110
Take it.

179
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:41,640
So heavy. Let me hold them.

180
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:42,429
Let me do it.

181
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:43,780
Thank you.

182
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:44,960
Master.

183
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:46,550
How's the preparation?

184
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:47,750
Anything else?

185
00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:48,470
Master,

186
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:50,180
I wiped the camera last night,

187
00:08:50,210 --> 00:08:51,420
but I still feel worried.

188
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:52,020
Master.

189
00:08:52,270 --> 00:08:53,440
This time when we take the phtograph of Bu'erhui,

190
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:55,600
steamed baozi surrounded by smoke will look good on the photos.

191
00:08:55,810 --> 00:08:56,390
Take it.

192
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,310
Do you think we should prepare

193
00:08:58,340 --> 00:08:59,660
some smoke-proof glass?

194
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:00,760
You're smart.

195
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:02,030
[Photography office]

196
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,160
Can I come in?

197
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:07,650
-Why are you here. -You agree.

198
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:12,280
Master.

199
00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:13,930
Is there anything else you can teach me?

200
00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:20,090
Ying,

201
00:09:20,570 --> 00:09:21,200
do you think

202
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:23,420
should we bring them together?

203
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:25,780
No one can match Zhuang.

204
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:28,700
Can you bear

205
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:31,640
to see your second best sister

206
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:32,460
lonely for the rest of life?

207
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:34,380
Who is the second best?

208
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,510
Both of you are my best sisters.

209
00:09:36,890 --> 00:09:38,320
And she won't be lonely for the rest of her life.

210
00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:39,570
Because I'll always be with her.

211
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:41,230
Fine.

212
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:42,890
Then you have a try.

213
00:09:44,890 --> 00:09:47,190
It depends on how the younger brother born in 1999 behaves.

214
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:49,110
How about

215
00:09:49,650 --> 00:09:51,180
why don't we

216
00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:52,590
encourage him

217
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:53,490
to confess his love directly?

218
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:56,310
Editor Shen.

219
00:09:57,290 --> 00:09:57,880
Come with me.

220
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:00,710
Finished?

221
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:03,550
Mr. Fang,

222
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,940
you made such a deal of homemade gorgon fruit by yourself?

223
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:06,760
Of course.

224
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,520
I've been arranged for everything.

225
00:10:09,850 --> 00:10:10,650
The gorgon fruit

226
00:10:11,270 --> 00:10:12,830
soaked in brown sugar water for more than ten seconds

227
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:14,120
is a perfect chance to get it done.

228
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:16,040
And then prinkle osmanthus.

229
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17,270
It's quite Jiangnan style.

230
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,320
All right, go out and accompany grandma.

231
00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:22,350
Okay.

232
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:23,560
We'll wait for you outside.

233
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:24,900
-Bye. -Bye.

234
00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:27,850
Gorgon fruit sweet soup. Please enjoy.

235
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:32,830
Grandma, have a taste.

236
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,690
See if it tastes the same as before.

237
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:40,710
Delicious.

238
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:43,000
It's soft, warm and newly peeled.

239
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:44,160
Delicious.

240
00:10:44,890 --> 00:10:45,900
It looks like Mr. Jin's.

241
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:46,710
Give me the wine.

242
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:48,450
Thank you for your warm heart.

243
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:49,470
Grandma,

244
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:51,220
we don't mean to offend you.

245
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,190
But we really want to know

246
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,530
the story of you and Mr. Jin in Bu'erhui

247
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:57,650
and the story of the gorgon fruit sweet soup.

248
00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:01,490
Please believe us.

249
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:03,570
If you want to hear the story,

250
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:05,840
I'll tell you.

251
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:09,870
My last name is Jin. My full name is Jin Lingzi.

252
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:12,110
The Buerhui Baozi Restaurant

253
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:15,540
indeed has something to do with my family.

254
00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:21,860
At that time, my mother

255
00:11:22,010 --> 00:11:23,770
was a famous singer.

256
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:26,480
Jin Buer's ancestors

257
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:29,000
were chefs of our family for generations.

258
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:32,420
Bu'erhui and Master Jin

259
00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:36,040
are my family and family member that I'll never forget.

260
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:39,780
They witnessed my growth

261
00:11:40,370 --> 00:11:42,010
and my best love.

262
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:52,640
What happened later?

263
00:11:53,150 --> 00:11:55,270
People get old and miss the old time.

264
00:11:55,610 --> 00:11:56,970
Mr. Jin is gone.

265
00:11:57,850 --> 00:12:00,090
Bu'erhui has changed.

266
00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:03,270
Now the taste is gone.

267
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,400
Why do you still want to go?

268
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:06,760
I...

269
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:10,380
I just want to wait.

270
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,040
Waiting for someone?

271
00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:18,110
Later,

272
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:20,670
at the end of spring of 1949

273
00:12:21,010 --> 00:12:22,800
when I was 18 years old,

274
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:26,680
-Madam, it's time to go or it will be late. -our family left Suzhou and went to Hong Kong.

275
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:30,310
We have no home in Suzhou.

276
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:32,800
Jin Buer promised

277
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,660
that he would pass on

278
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:37,180
the Baozi Restaurant that we missed.

279
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:39,700
When we came back,

280
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,130
there was still something hanging in our heart.

281
00:12:42,130 --> 00:12:43,420
When we arrived in Hong Kong,

282
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:46,720
the memories of our hometown were getting farther and farther.

283
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,160
I was deeply influenced by my mom's word since childhood.

284
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:51,470
I inherited the title of my mother

285
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:52,780
and developed in Hong Kong.

286
00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:54,860
I gained popularity for a while.

287
00:12:55,710 --> 00:12:57,830
I didn't know where he was,

288
00:12:57,950 --> 00:12:58,970
but I believed

289
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:02,490
the promise we made is worth waiting for a lifetime.

290
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:04,170
Today,

291
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:06,720
thank you for the gorgon fruit sweet soup.

292
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:10,820
It reminds me of the wonderful old time.

293
00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:14,910
Thank you so much.

294
00:13:17,210 --> 00:13:18,170
I'm leaving.

295
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,000
I hope you can find your lover.

296
00:13:20,530 --> 00:13:21,350
Thank you, Grandma.

297
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:23,310
Be careful on your way back.

298
00:13:23,690 --> 00:13:24,350
Okay.

299
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:26,150
Be careful.

300
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:26,600
Okay.

301
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:28,410
I'll see you off here.

302
00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:28,990
Okay.

303
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:29,780
Give me a hug, grandma.

304
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,120
Thank you for your story.

305
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:34,360
Okay.

306
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:35,710
I'm leaving.

307
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:36,150
Take care.

308
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:42,900
Bye.

309
00:13:52,370 --> 00:13:52,990
Are you touched by the story?

310
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:57,480
There are two types of people,

311
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,480
charming and boring.

312
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,640
Grandma Jin is so charming.

313
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,070
It's misfortune,

314
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:09,260
but also luck.

315
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:18,590
I need to go back to the office to write.

316
00:14:18,830 --> 00:14:19,390
Shen Ying,

317
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:21,980
I don't encourage employees to work overtime.

318
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:24,900
but I want to write the story of Bu'erhui.

319
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:26,050
How?

320
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:27,030
Truth.

321
00:14:27,390 --> 00:14:27,920
Truth?

322
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:30,620
I don't want to flatter Mr. Jin anymore.

323
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:32,580
He doesn't deserve to be written by me

324
00:14:32,890 --> 00:14:34,130
in the column of Buerhui.

325
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:36,140
Like you said,

326
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:37,630
what can touch people's heart

327
00:14:38,850 --> 00:14:40,090
is always the taste of food.

328
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:43,490
Thank you, Shen Ying.

329
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:44,720
I'll take you back to the office.

330
00:14:45,630 --> 00:14:45,920
Okay.

331
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:46,910
Let's go.

332
00:14:56,070 --> 00:14:58,040
Thank you for sending me back.

333
00:14:58,110 --> 00:14:59,610
Thank you for arranging the meeting with Grandma Jin.

334
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:01,960
I also want to thank you for your gorgon fruit

335
00:15:02,170 --> 00:15:03,940
and your coming back to work overtime.

336
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:06,460
We're now even.

337
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:08,680
It's getting late.

338
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:09,350
Go back early.

339
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:16,950
You heard nothing.

340
00:15:17,290 --> 00:15:18,090
Go back to work.

341
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:21,350
Director, see you tomorrow.

342
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:22,190
See you soon.

343
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:23,780
Right away.

344
00:15:24,910 --> 00:15:25,950
Isn't it tomorrow?

345
00:15:32,830 --> 00:15:33,230
Hello.

346
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:34,520
I want to buy one more croissant.

347
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:34,840
Okay.

348
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:35,910
Do you need to heat it up, sir?

349
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:36,390
Yes.

350
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:37,730
Two more pieces of this, please.

351
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:38,740
-Okay, wait. -Thanks.

352
00:15:54,410 --> 00:15:55,850
Didn't you say we'll meet tomorrow?

353
00:15:56,430 --> 00:15:58,100
I said I'll see you soon.

354
00:16:00,690 --> 00:16:01,350
Eat it while it's warm.

355
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:06,310
I'm not hungry.

356
00:16:06,510 --> 00:16:07,920
Why don't you eat?

357
00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:13,830
I think it's better for the person whose belly is complaining.

358
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:17,640
Whose belly is complaining?

359
00:16:19,010 --> 00:16:20,210
I'm going to work overtime. Eat up.

360
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:21,640
Okay.

361
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:31,860
I didn't expect the food from the convenience store to be cooked like this.

362
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:33,210
It's delicious.

363
00:16:39,930 --> 00:16:40,430
Come in.

364
00:16:47,330 --> 00:16:47,920
Director,

365
00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:49,650
have you received the manuscript?

366
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:50,740
Yes.

367
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:51,470
I just finished.

368
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:52,120
How is it?

369
00:16:52,770 --> 00:16:53,320
Good.

370
00:16:53,830 --> 00:16:55,090
That's a good evaluation.

371
00:16:55,850 --> 00:16:57,930
This is the first time you praised me.

372
00:16:59,160 --> 00:16:59,680
Really?

373
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:02,300
I am always impartial.

374
00:17:04,359 --> 00:17:05,630
I'll get off work then.

375
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:07,690
Thanks for your cheese croissant.

376
00:17:08,589 --> 00:17:09,079
Shen Ying,

377
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:10,730
I have also finished my work.

378
00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:11,349
Let me give you a ride.

379
00:17:11,619 --> 00:17:12,270
Don't bother.

380
00:17:12,950 --> 00:17:13,390
Not all.

381
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:15,440
It's too late to take a taxi.

382
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:17,480
And it's not safe for a girl.

383
00:17:19,069 --> 00:17:19,630
Okay.

384
00:17:20,210 --> 00:17:21,150
Not a big deal. Let's go.

385
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:21,790
Okay.

386
00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:41,260
I don't encourage employees to work overtime like that.

387
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:42,480
You don't have to do that.

388
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:44,210
Take care of your own body.

389
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:46,450
You don't look like...

390
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:49,650
Do I look like a workaholic?

391
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:54,200
A workaholic and a despotic landlord.

392
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:58,260
Oh my god.

393
00:17:58,410 --> 00:17:59,170
Can you smile?

394
00:17:59,450 --> 00:18:00,490
The sun is rising from the west.

395
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:24,750
Let me help you.

396
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:32,870
Thank you.

397
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,040
You're off work, Ying.

398
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:18,620
You go back first.

399
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:20,270
Don't we need to wait for you?

400
00:19:20,390 --> 00:19:22,180
I haven't finished the manuscript that Director Zheng asked for.

401
00:19:22,670 --> 00:19:23,470
I'll go with them.

402
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:24,070
Hurry up.

403
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:24,990
Okay.

404
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:26,130
I'll go after I finish this.

405
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:39,820
Oh my gosh.

406
00:19:40,270 --> 00:19:42,080
Why doesn't the period come earlier or later?

407
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:44,120
It comes when everyone has just left.

408
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:47,720
Hello?

409
00:19:48,910 --> 00:19:50,270
Is anyone here?

410
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:51,320
Madam.

411
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:53,540
Is the cleaning lady here?

412
00:19:53,730 --> 00:19:57,900
Is there a kind person who can help me?

413
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:02,790
Hello?

414
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:03,800
Hello, Director.

415
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:05,680
Are you in the office?

416
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,120
Yes, I'm in the office.

417
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:10,240
I may need your help.

418
00:20:11,170 --> 00:20:13,050
That...

419
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:14,550
What?

420
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:16,430
It's...

421
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:19,700
That...

422
00:20:20,810 --> 00:20:21,610
What?

423
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:23,760
Sanitary pads.

424
00:20:26,810 --> 00:20:29,010
I have no choice.

425
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:38,480
Did you bring the shooting plan?

426
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:39,680
All the equipment?

427
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:41,020
Yes, check it.

428
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:41,520
When we arrive,

429
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:42,790
we may not have much time to prepare.

430
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:48,030
♫Ride my beloved motorcycle♫

431
00:20:49,450 --> 00:20:52,250
♫It will never get stuck in traffic♫

432
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:53,560
Yu Sicheng.

433
00:20:55,850 --> 00:20:56,280
Master, hi.

434
00:20:58,910 --> 00:20:59,670
Why aren't you in the company?

435
00:20:59,690 --> 00:21:00,290
Why are you here?

436
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:01,370
I'm going to shoot with you.

437
00:21:01,490 --> 00:21:04,010
Come on...

438
00:21:04,550 --> 00:21:05,830
I really...

439
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:07,020
I'm speechless, okay?

440
00:21:07,050 --> 00:21:09,050
Don't embarrass me, OK?

441
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:10,320
Are you crazy?

442
00:21:11,890 --> 00:21:12,450
Master,

443
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:14,130
Let me talk about you.

444
00:21:14,570 --> 00:21:16,130
It's Valentine's Day.

445
00:21:16,390 --> 00:21:17,270
Your romantic cells

446
00:21:18,350 --> 00:21:19,230
have not been developed fully.

447
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:24,300
But in the future, you have me.

448
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:30,190
Master! Master! Master!

449
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:32,070
Do you want to take my motorcyle?

450
00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:32,930
It will not be stuck in the traffic jam.

451
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:34,150
It's faster than yours.

452
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:35,400
Go back to work.

453
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:43,670
-♫Ride my beloved motorcycle♫ -Fine, have you prepared well?

454
00:21:43,670 --> 00:21:44,800
How many times have I told you?

455
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:45,830
It'll be fine.

456
00:21:49,670 --> 00:21:50,590
What time is it?

457
00:21:50,610 --> 00:21:51,690
Hurry up, okay?

458
00:21:52,650 --> 00:21:54,090
Master, have some water.

459
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:54,760
No, no, no.

460
00:21:54,790 --> 00:21:55,350
Is this okay?

461
00:21:57,590 --> 00:21:59,220
Time to work. Stop playing with your phone.

462
00:22:00,330 --> 00:22:01,230
Master, enjoy the fan.

463
00:22:01,230 --> 00:22:01,760
Come on.

464
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:02,900
Put those things in place.

465
00:22:02,930 --> 00:22:03,610
Get closer to the chair.

466
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:05,400
Move, move, move.

467
00:22:05,790 --> 00:22:06,870
It's about time to invite the actor.

468
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:09,440
Sir,

469
00:22:09,470 --> 00:22:10,550
we've set up the scene.

470
00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:11,350
Okay.

471
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:15,480
Master, enjoy the fan.

472
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:16,780
Hello.

473
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:18,820
Let's take a seat and check the light.

474
00:22:21,910 --> 00:22:22,270
Okay.

475
00:22:22,410 --> 00:22:23,450
Let's start filming now.

476
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:25,580
We need to adjust the collar

477
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:27,970
-a little bit -Master.

478
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:29,660
Let me do it.

479
00:22:31,010 --> 00:22:31,440
Master.

480
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:33,150
Focus on the shooting.

481
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:34,470
Tell me if you need anything.

482
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:35,440
The collar is crooked, right?

483
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:37,460
The collar is crooked.

484
00:22:40,450 --> 00:22:41,420
-OK? -OK.

485
00:22:42,590 --> 00:22:42,970
Sir,

486
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,190
Make your clothes more smooth.

487
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:45,380
Let me do it.

488
00:22:45,870 --> 00:22:46,590
-Make your clothes more smooth. -Yu Sicheng.

489
00:22:49,210 --> 00:22:49,730
Are you playing?

490
00:22:50,510 --> 00:22:51,510
I am helping you.

491
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:56,750
Let's continue.

492
00:22:57,450 --> 00:22:58,830
Master, you use the fan.

493
00:22:58,830 --> 00:23:00,220
You're in the photo.

494
00:23:01,150 --> 00:23:02,350
Stay where you are, okay?

495
00:23:04,110 --> 00:23:05,170
Sorry, let's continue.

496
00:23:06,310 --> 00:23:07,150
Stop playing with your phone.

497
00:23:07,570 --> 00:23:08,450
Yes, look at me.

498
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:10,360
Get closer to me.

499
00:23:10,810 --> 00:23:11,810
Yes, get closer to my machine.

500
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:12,910
Come this way.

501
00:23:13,230 --> 00:23:13,750
Watch out!

502
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:19,960
How are you?

503
00:23:20,170 --> 00:23:20,690
How are you?

504
00:23:21,310 --> 00:23:21,910
Are you okay?

505
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:24,360
I'm fine.

506
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:26,650
-Let me have a look. -Not a big deal.

507
00:23:27,150 --> 00:23:29,230
Stop shouldering it. Take it off. Let me see.

508
00:23:29,530 --> 00:23:30,070
It's too dangerous.

509
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,150
How did you do your job?

510
00:23:31,150 --> 00:23:31,920
You didn't watch it well.

511
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:32,410
I'm sorry.

512
00:23:32,470 --> 00:23:33,110
Let's go to the hospital.

513
00:23:33,650 --> 00:23:34,860
I'm fine. I'm really fine.

514
00:23:34,890 --> 00:23:36,260
It's just a small injury. Look.

515
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:38,350
Luckily, I'm fine.

516
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:39,030
All right.

517
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,160
Go back to work.

518
00:23:40,470 --> 00:23:41,430
We've been busy for so long.

519
00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:42,370
If you leave,

520
00:23:42,450 --> 00:23:43,090
how about them?

521
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:46,590
OK.

522
00:23:49,870 --> 00:23:50,350
Come on.

523
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:52,180
Sorry, buddy.

524
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,010
Let's continue.

525
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:56,470
Okay.

526
00:24:05,730 --> 00:24:06,630
Okay, let's continue.

527
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:10,360
Take a look.

528
00:24:11,270 --> 00:24:11,990
Is this called publicity?

529
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:14,310
What are you writing?

530
00:24:14,310 --> 00:24:15,510
You're in trouble, you know?

531
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:17,520
Miss Jin is arguing with Zheng Tao there.

532
00:24:17,690 --> 00:24:20,140
[Bu'erhui lowers its head to capital and forgets its promises]

533
00:24:18,090 --> 00:24:19,250
Your report

534
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:21,070
caused heated public discussion online.

535
00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:23,490
What did you write?

536
00:24:23,650 --> 00:24:24,490
Don't go in now.

537
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:25,560
Don't you want to die?

538
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:26,540
I invested so much money

539
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:28,850
not to ask you to point your fingers at me

540
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,030
and call me a profiteer.

541
00:24:30,590 --> 00:24:32,070
Don't you know

542
00:24:32,090 --> 00:24:33,010
how important the image is for a company?

543
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:36,290
You hurt me with my money

544
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:37,360
and spread rumors about me.

545
00:24:38,990 --> 00:24:40,330
I'm going to sue you.

546
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:41,670
Director Jin,

547
00:24:42,110 --> 00:24:43,030
don't be angry.

548
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:44,560
Director Zheng has been responsible for

549
00:24:44,590 --> 00:24:45,990
the new media.

550
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:47,970
He doesn't need my review.

551
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,250
But I think

552
00:24:50,330 --> 00:24:52,850
there must be some misunderstanding.

553
00:24:54,430 --> 00:24:55,300
Tell me.

554
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:56,800
I will try my best to help you.

555
00:24:56,830 --> 00:24:57,950
There's nothing to say.

556
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:02,680
You must compensate me for my loss.

557
00:25:02,850 --> 00:25:04,820
I approved the article.

558
00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:08,020
It has nothing to do with my editor.

559
00:25:08,330 --> 00:25:08,890
What did you say?

560
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:09,960
The content is true.

561
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:11,030
It's not fabricated.

562
00:25:11,350 --> 00:25:12,070
What do you mean?

563
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:13,500
What I mean is quite simple.

564
00:25:13,870 --> 00:25:15,710
We Aescn won't be threatened

565
00:25:15,730 --> 00:25:16,410
to change the principle.

566
00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:18,440
Do you want to file a complaint or sue me?

567
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:19,530
Suit yourself.

568
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:20,180
Director Zheng.

569
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:22,450
Okay.

570
00:25:23,270 --> 00:25:24,470
I'll show no mercy then.

571
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:26,680
Miranda,

572
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:30,040
don't blame me for not respecting you.

573
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:32,390
Shen Ying.

574
00:25:32,950 --> 00:25:33,800
-Miranda. -Director Jin.

575
00:25:36,670 --> 00:25:37,710
That report is actually...

576
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:38,790
Mr Jin,

577
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:42,810
you can choose to give up

578
00:25:43,190 --> 00:25:44,750
to terminate the contract by any legal way..

579
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:46,980
I'll fight to the end.

580
00:25:56,380 --> 00:25:57,500
Very good.

581
00:26:00,330 --> 00:26:00,810
Director Jin.

582
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:02,850
Director Jin, calm down.

583
00:26:03,470 --> 00:26:04,030
Director Jin.

584
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:17,690
Why did you take the blame for me?

585
00:26:18,630 --> 00:26:20,240
This happened because of me.

586
00:26:20,790 --> 00:26:21,550
I'm willing to take responsibility.

587
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:23,400
Taste it.

588
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:26,950
You still have the mood to drink coffee?

589
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:28,350
Mr Jin may

590
00:26:28,370 --> 00:26:29,550
report you to the headquarters

591
00:26:29,550 --> 00:26:30,390
and mess with you.

592
00:26:31,150 --> 00:26:32,340
Do you think I'm afraid of them?

593
00:26:39,730 --> 00:26:40,300
I'm sorry.

594
00:26:41,470 --> 00:26:42,480
I was too impulsive.

595
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:45,930
Did you apologize for telling the truth?

596
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,200
I don't want to get you involved.

597
00:26:49,390 --> 00:26:49,990
You're wrong.

598
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:51,380
You didn't implicate me.

599
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,240
I reviewed your articles.

600
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:54,760
I'm your direct leader.

601
00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:57,460
I am the most qualified to take the responsibility.

602
00:26:58,210 --> 00:26:58,930
It's not your turn.

603
00:27:07,190 --> 00:27:07,990
Don't worry.

604
00:27:08,270 --> 00:27:09,340
I'll deal with this.

605
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:10,780
How?

606
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:12,470
Mr Jin and Miranda

607
00:27:12,570 --> 00:27:13,690
are just playing along.

608
00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:17,420
They don't dare to make a fuss

609
00:27:17,590 --> 00:27:18,550
or sue us.

610
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:21,900
This matter is a little complicated.

611
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:22,760
Don't get involved.

612
00:27:23,150 --> 00:27:23,500
Remember,

613
00:27:23,650 --> 00:27:24,980
just do your job.

614
00:27:27,730 --> 00:27:28,270
Okay.

615
00:27:28,690 --> 00:27:29,030
By the way,

616
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:32,080
let me take you to meet my old friends.

617
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:33,470
You can interview them.

618
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:34,320
Okay.

619
00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:35,390
Where are we going?

620
00:27:35,670 --> 00:27:36,140
Central Street.

621
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:37,710
Isn't that my hometown?

622
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:38,510
Yes.

623
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:39,970
I'm going to your hometown.

624
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:40,550
Cheer up.

625
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:41,670
Okay.

626
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:43,590
Taste it.

627
00:28:02,590 --> 00:28:03,430
Is this camera good?

628
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:05,960
Yes.

629
00:28:06,050 --> 00:28:06,560
Thank you.

630
00:28:06,770 --> 00:28:07,210
Good.

631
00:28:10,050 --> 00:28:11,210
Jiangnan Ancient Street like this

632
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:13,090
can attract my childhood memories.

633
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:14,920
When I was young,

634
00:28:14,950 --> 00:28:16,710
my parents liked to come here

635
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:18,660
to buy me meat mooncakes, dumplings with crab roe soup,

636
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:21,220
chicken feet, lardy cake, and oil dough.

637
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:23,080
Have you tasted them?

638
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:24,160
No.

639
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:25,990
I don't like fried food

640
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:27,240
with bad cooking skills and low quality materials.

641
00:28:31,550 --> 00:28:32,800
Does he have any interest?

642
00:28:33,150 --> 00:28:34,830
Maybe he is even not interested in girls?

643
00:28:40,530 --> 00:28:41,170
Lovely cat.

644
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:42,620
Who tied it here?

645
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:44,240
Untie it.

646
00:28:46,910 --> 00:28:47,900
Poor thing.

647
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:51,430
Here.

648
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:54,340
Lovely cat.

649
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,400
Let me hold you.

650
00:28:56,430 --> 00:28:57,830
You won't be afraid if I hold you.

651
00:28:59,150 --> 00:28:59,510
Hello.

652
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:00,930
This is my cat.

653
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:02,840
Your cat. Here.

654
00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:04,860
Thank you. Thank you.

655
00:29:05,490 --> 00:29:06,130
Bye.

656
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:10,590
What are you looking at?

657
00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:12,660
Nothing.

658
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:13,250
Someone is waiting for us.

659
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:13,670
Let's go.

660
00:29:15,410 --> 00:29:16,270
Who's waiting for us?

661
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:17,110
You'll know then.

662
00:29:17,870 --> 00:29:18,350
Grandma.

663
00:29:18,370 --> 00:29:19,170
Zheng.

664
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:19,690
Long time no see.

665
00:29:21,540 --> 00:29:22,290
How about you recently?

666
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:23,680
Yes.

667
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:24,510
Hello, Grandma.

668
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:26,750
This lady is so beautiful.

669
00:29:27,070 --> 00:29:28,380
-Thank you. -Is she your girlfriend?

670
00:29:28,770 --> 00:29:29,180
No.

671
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:31,090
-She is my colleague. -We are colleagues.

672
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:31,860
Okay.

673
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:33,520
Come in.

674
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,240
Husband.

675
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:38,400
-Husband. -Grandpa.

676
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:39,860
Zheng, you're here.

677
00:29:39,950 --> 00:29:40,470
Long time no see.

678
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:41,060
How are you?

679
00:29:41,210 --> 00:29:42,000
Fine.

680
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:42,480
That's good.

681
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,240
I am happy for your coming.

682
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:45,260
Hello, grandpa.

683
00:29:46,070 --> 00:29:46,740
This is Grandpa Yuan.

684
00:29:46,770 --> 00:29:47,360
Hello, Grandpa Yuan.

685
00:29:47,410 --> 00:29:47,910
Grandma Huiyan.

686
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:48,820
Grandma Huiyan.

687
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:50,050
I met them abroad.

688
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:52,920
Grandpa's boiled glutinous rice balls in fermented glutinous rice are amazing.

689
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:55,960
Stop talking nonsense.

690
00:29:56,130 --> 00:29:57,490
Go to get the things you prepared.

691
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:58,080
Okay.

692
00:29:58,250 --> 00:29:58,760
Thank you.

693
00:29:58,760 --> 00:29:59,670
Come, let's sit inside.

694
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:01,950
Here you are. Boiled glutinous rice balls in fermented glutinous rice.

695
00:30:02,190 --> 00:30:02,630
Lady,

696
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:04,680
taste the rice balls I made.

697
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:05,620
Thank you, grandpa.

698
00:30:06,890 --> 00:30:07,210
Have a taste.

699
00:30:07,230 --> 00:30:07,710
Have a taste.

700
00:30:14,770 --> 00:30:15,760
Inside of the rice balls made by grandpa,

701
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:17,510
there is a faint osmanthus fragrance.

702
00:30:17,790 --> 00:30:18,390
It's fragrant and glutinous.

703
00:30:18,990 --> 00:30:19,750
You can't taste it outside, right?

704
00:30:20,250 --> 00:30:20,870
Grandma.

705
00:30:20,890 --> 00:30:21,710
As a local,

706
00:30:21,710 --> 00:30:23,630
I really think these little balls are so authentic.

707
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:25,570
I'm going to introduce my family to eat it.

708
00:30:26,030 --> 00:30:27,480
I am glad that you like it.

709
00:30:27,940 --> 00:30:28,750
Zheng said

710
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,800
you are here to listen to our story?

711
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:31,180
Yes.

712
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:33,610
We're pre-heating for Valentine's Day.

713
00:30:33,780 --> 00:30:35,860
We want to know more about the old generation's story.

714
00:30:37,470 --> 00:30:39,550
It was a long time ago.

715
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:41,900
We were still young back then.

716
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:43,590
We just got married for two years.

717
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:45,700
He left without a word.

718
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:48,200
He asked me to wait for him before he left.

719
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:51,160
He left 19 years.

720
00:30:52,470 --> 00:30:53,540
19 years?

721
00:30:53,870 --> 00:30:54,990
Grandpa, where have you been?

722
00:30:56,150 --> 00:30:57,790
You need to tell the whole story.

723
00:30:58,150 --> 00:31:00,130
Don't let young people think I'm bad.

724
00:31:00,250 --> 00:31:01,410
Okay.

725
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:02,840
Actually,

726
00:31:02,970 --> 00:31:04,810
he was a soldier.

727
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,990
He received a secret mission

728
00:31:07,390 --> 00:31:08,670
because of his special identity.

729
00:31:09,590 --> 00:31:12,090
I waited for him at that alley.

730
00:31:15,950 --> 00:31:16,550
Grandma.

731
00:31:17,010 --> 00:31:18,170
Grandpa has left for a long time.

732
00:31:18,430 --> 00:31:20,110
Were you confident that he would come back?

733
00:31:20,530 --> 00:31:22,750
I was willing to wait for him even if it's a lifetime.

734
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:24,810
After all,

735
00:31:25,180 --> 00:31:27,020
I only want to love him.

736
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:46,220
Promise to grow old together.

737
00:31:46,830 --> 00:31:48,150
Accompany each other for a century.

738
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:52,500
I want to make a love story with a nostalgic theme,

739
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:55,090
but I haven't figured out how to write it.

740
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:57,260
Have you ever thought whether

741
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:58,320
such a love story

742
00:31:58,620 --> 00:31:59,900
can attract young people?

743
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:02,160
Yes.

744
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:04,750
So I want to combine some elements.

745
00:32:06,030 --> 00:32:08,140
But what should I combine?

746
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:10,440
Actually, I think

747
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:11,990
the way that grandparents told stories

748
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:13,520
is the soul of this story.

749
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:15,840
There are various contents right now.

750
00:32:16,430 --> 00:32:17,550
As transmissors,

751
00:32:17,660 --> 00:32:19,180
we shouldn't be limited to the form of words.

752
00:32:19,850 --> 00:32:21,090
We can use more images.

753
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:23,180
It's good,

754
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:25,440
but what grandparents said is too fragmentary.

755
00:32:26,070 --> 00:32:28,030
How should I combine those fragmentary words

756
00:32:28,070 --> 00:32:29,030
together?

757
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:44,840
From the perspective of a young lady,

758
00:32:45,230 --> 00:32:47,260
telling an old but beautiful love story

759
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:49,360
will give people a special sense of freshness

760
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:50,150
and sense of space.

761
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:51,670
Let's start.

762
00:32:52,580 --> 00:32:53,730
I can't.

763
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:56,790
Three, two, one.

764
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:58,400
Okay.

765
00:32:59,330 --> 00:33:00,370
Hello, everyone.

766
00:33:00,490 --> 00:33:02,730
We are at a beach with a beautiful view.

767
00:33:03,150 --> 00:33:04,350
Not far away from here

768
00:33:04,370 --> 00:33:06,040
there is a special bookstore.

769
00:33:06,830 --> 00:33:10,160
The deal of boiled glutinous rice balls in fermented glutinous rice there

770
00:33:10,450 --> 00:33:12,000
has attracted the soul of travelers.

771
00:33:14,990 --> 00:33:15,580
What do you think?

772
00:33:16,550 --> 00:33:17,150
Not bad.

773
00:33:17,490 --> 00:33:19,420
The light is slightly weak.

774
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:22,070
I think it's good.

775
00:33:22,530 --> 00:33:23,030
By the way,

776
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:24,290
where did you book the hotel tonight?

777
00:33:25,390 --> 00:33:26,760
Oh, no. I forgot to book it in advance.

778
00:33:27,110 --> 00:33:27,910
Sorry, Director.

779
00:33:28,690 --> 00:33:29,160
How about this?

780
00:33:29,190 --> 00:33:30,230
I search it online right now.

781
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:37,140
It's weekend today.

782
00:33:37,350 --> 00:33:39,510
The hotel nearby seems to be full.

783
00:33:40,540 --> 00:33:41,100
Really?

784
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:42,980
It's okay.

785
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:44,930
Let's go wherever we meet on the way.

786
00:33:45,210 --> 00:33:45,590
Let's go.

787
00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:47,100
Okay.

788
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:51,180
[Memorable Night Theme Hotel]

789
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:54,490
Hello, welcome.

790
00:33:54,940 --> 00:33:56,100
Do you have a reservation?

791
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:57,330
No.

792
00:33:58,030 --> 00:33:58,800
Two rooms.

793
00:33:59,410 --> 00:34:00,250
Two rooms?

794
00:34:00,670 --> 00:34:01,640
Are you sure it's two?

795
00:34:02,150 --> 00:34:03,500
It's the peak season of vacation on Valentine's Day.

796
00:34:03,810 --> 00:34:04,690
The rooms are in shortage.
