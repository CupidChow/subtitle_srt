[Episode 14]

3
00:01:35,789 --> 00:01:36,229
Hello,

4
00:01:36,509 --> 00:01:37,320
are you Mr. Zheng?

5
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:37,660
Yes.

6
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:38,960
I'm Guan Guan's lawyer.

7
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:39,860
Nice to meet you.

8
00:01:40,729 --> 00:01:41,190
Nice to meet you.

9
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:43,360
Mr. Zheng.

10
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:45,350
Zheng Dao.

11
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:47,820
Come and sit.

12
00:01:48,979 --> 00:01:49,410
Mr. Yu.

13
00:01:50,050 --> 00:01:52,220
The most problematic factor of food poisoning:

14
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:53,330
an evil person does bad things

15
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:54,530
intentionally.

16
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:55,630
But the customer has to prove

17
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:57,740
he was poisoned because of something from Si.

18
00:01:57,860 --> 00:01:59,120
He eats so many kinds of food every day.

19
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:00,360
How can he be sure

20
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:02,120
that it was food from Si that caused it?

21
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,510
The receipt has been given to Guan Guan.

22
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:05,870
It's very easy to prove.

23
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:07,130
Why didn't he call the police?

24
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,180
Why not?

25
00:02:09,139 --> 00:02:10,330
Why not?

26
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:12,130
I thought today's main character

27
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:14,330
would be Guan Guan or his lawyer.

28
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:19,730
Guan Guan's lawyer is also my lawyer.

29
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,760
So it's you who invited me here?

30
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:23,600
Yes.

31
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:25,260
Mr. Yu,

32
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,320
are you meeting me as the Party A of Isen

33
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:29,670
or as somebody else?

34
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:31,140
As far as I know,

35
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:33,500
Guan Guan's talent agency has nothing to do

36
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:34,730
with your group.

37
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:37,770
Guan Guan and I only cooperate indirectly.

38
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:39,350
Today,

39
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:42,870
as the chairman of Shengshi Group,

40
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:46,490
I intend to make a deal with you, Mr. Zheng.

41
00:02:47,079 --> 00:02:47,700
I'm all ears.

42
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:49,420
Are you sure the making process of the dish was all good?

43
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:50,640
I'm sure.

44
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:51,470
He, as an idol,

45
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:52,140
is not involved in catering industry.

46
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:53,190
Why did he take aim at Si?

47
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:54,340
Did someone deliberately frame Si?

48
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:56,180
It's not confirmed that he was indeed poisoned.

49
00:02:56,270 --> 00:02:57,070
Could it be faked?

50
00:02:57,780 --> 00:02:58,800
He has such a tight schedule every day.

51
00:02:58,829 --> 00:02:59,600
He's way too busy.

52
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:00,810
There's no need for him to do this.

53
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,680
There are no grudges between Guan Guan and Si.

54
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:05,290
Maybe they are competitors.

55
00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:06,610
Vicious competition.

56
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:08,670
Vicious competition?

57
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,920
I specially prepared you

58
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:13,420
a cup of Yirgacheffe.

59
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:14,710
Try it.

60
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:16,280
Yirgacheffe.

61
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,490
This kind of coffee is for young people.

62
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:19,380
Yes.

63
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:21,370
I really hope you could

64
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:23,640
join Shengshi Group

65
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:26,130
and become the new mainstay

66
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,530
in the catering industry.

67
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:29,060
After all,

68
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:31,260
we old people

69
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:33,700
can't keep up with the times.

70
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:34,460
Mr. Yu,

71
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:35,610
you're too modest.

72
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:38,730
Compared to Yirgacheffe,

73
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:40,480
I prefer Geisha.

74
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:44,079
"Yirga" means to settle down,

75
00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:46,410
and "cheffe" means wetland.

76
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:51,970
Shengshi Group can provide "comfortable and

77
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,240
warm wetlands" for Mr. Zheng.

78
00:03:56,390 --> 00:03:59,790
We can develop quality products together.

79
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:02,500
I'm very confident of it.

80
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:06,010
Actually, I'm quite confident

81
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:07,230
about the tesing result of the food of Si.

82
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:08,950
But the public opinion has been

83
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:09,730
hugely affected.

84
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:11,880
After the testing,

85
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:13,210
Si will be reopened again.

86
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,100
At that time,

87
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:17,230
how to reconstruct consumers' confidence in Si

88
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:18,870
will be the key issue.

89
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:23,720
What I want to say is,

90
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:25,610
if the making process of our dishes

91
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:26,480
has no problem,

92
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:29,150
no matter how many times we make it,

93
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:30,300
it should be okay.

94
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:34,130
Then let's make Lamb Chop with Lobsters again

95
00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:35,460
on reopening day,

96
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:38,200
and invite everyone to taste it and supervise us.

97
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:41,090
What if bad guys come to frame Fang Siwei again?

98
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,580
Then we can just lure them out of hiding.

99
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:47,450
Why don't we do a live broadcast online

100
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:49,300
during the reopening?

101
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:51,820
We'll beat data traffic with data traffic.

102
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:53,190
They dared to create social pressure with Guan Guan.

103
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:55,180
We'll also use Guan Guan's appeal

104
00:04:55,850 --> 00:04:56,360
to fight back.

105
00:04:58,470 --> 00:04:59,130
Your Geisha.

106
00:04:59,380 --> 00:04:59,820
Thank you.

107
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:03,720
So you like Geisha from the forest.

108
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:04,650
That's right.

109
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:07,140
But this is

110
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,040
Geisha from Shengshi Group.

111
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:13,100
Mr. Zheng,

112
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:14,510
You're too courteous.

113
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:16,010
Mr. Yu,

114
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:17,480
we are essentially strangers.

115
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:18,880
Mr. Zheng,

116
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:22,380
I think you know what I mean.

117
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,640
I came to you directly,

118
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:26,700
instead of Fang Siwei,

119
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,780
because I want to recruit the able man.

120
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:33,730
I value you for your talent.

121
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:37,650
Looks like you know me well.

122
00:05:38,409 --> 00:05:41,040
Know yourself and your enemy, and you'll never be defeated.

123
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:43,040
This should be a principle

124
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:45,310
even kids understand.

125
00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:48,070
Now that you know I'm the chef,

126
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:49,850
you should also know

127
00:05:50,170 --> 00:05:51,300
I don't cook anymore.

128
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:56,120
I did know that.

129
00:05:57,170 --> 00:05:58,140
It's okay if you don't cook.

130
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:02,330
Since you can be the best chef of Si,

131
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:05,080
there must be something special in you.

132
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,200
Why don’t you do it in Shengshi Group?

133
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,270
Here the platform is bigger,

134
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:11,810
and the space is ampler.

135
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:15,780
The roasting of Geisha's

136
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:18,870
beans should stop right before the second crack or immediately after it begins.

137
00:06:19,890 --> 00:06:21,670
If the beans are roasted too lightly, the flavor won't be pure.

138
00:06:22,010 --> 00:06:24,970
Too deeply, the beans will lose the fragrance of flowers and the tart flavor.

139
00:06:25,890 --> 00:06:27,060
Although the process is complicated

140
00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:28,230
and the output is limited,

141
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:29,840
but the quality is exceptional.

142
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:31,920
As for Yirgacheffe,

143
00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:33,230
with its expanded producing area,

144
00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:34,300
increased output,

145
00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:36,430
and a simple making process,

146
00:06:36,970 --> 00:06:38,730
its quality can't be guaranteed.

147
00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:45,780
So you are saying

148
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:48,070
you refuse my invitation?

149
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,050
That's right.

150
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:51,890
Your olive branch should be left

151
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:53,480
to those in need.

152
00:06:57,790 --> 00:06:58,390
Mr. Zheng,

153
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:00,180
I want you to read a contract

154
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:05,670
and see the sincerity of Shengshi Group.

155
00:07:06,850 --> 00:07:07,260
[Employment Contract]

156
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:10,250
[Article IV: Remuneration]

157
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:11,230
Yes!

158
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:15,440
This time, it's going to be an eye for an eye

159
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:16,830
and a tooth for a tooth!

160
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:20,040
I'll contact the media

161
00:07:20,450 --> 00:07:21,930
and we'll make our live streaming

162
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,610
occupy the homepages of all the big apps.

163
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:27,160
Yu Sicheng and I

164
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:29,020
will be in charge of filming and preparations.

165
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:32,860
When a couple work together,

166
00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:33,690
they'll succeed for sure!

167
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:36,930
I sense some smell of jealousy!

168
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:41,760
Excuse me.

169
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:42,590
I have to check my phone.

170
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:44,780
Where are you?

171
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:45,780
I'm coming to

172
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,950
talk to you about the results of our meeting today.

173
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:48,560
OK.

174
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:49,490
I'll send you the address.

175
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:50,360
See you later.

176
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,070
Where are you going?

177
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,690
I'm gonna go spread more smell of jealousy.

178
00:07:58,180 --> 00:07:58,520
What?

179
00:07:58,540 --> 00:07:59,470
I'm going to find Zheng Dao.

180
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:00,800
Zhuang Yan,

181
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:02,280
contact

182
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:03,590
the Singles Protection Association for me.

183
00:08:03,730 --> 00:08:05,490
You might as well go home to sleep.

184
00:08:05,730 --> 00:08:06,660
You can have everything in your dream.

185
00:08:06,970 --> 00:08:07,650
That's right.

186
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:13,140
Mr. Yu,

187
00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:14,400
about this...

188
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:15,450
I'm really sorry.

189
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:18,680
This is our greatest sincerity.

190
00:08:23,090 --> 00:08:24,330
Mr. Zheng, you may not know this,

191
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,060
but we also know something about your past

192
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:27,720
in Europe.

193
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:30,410
As for this Guan Guan incident,

194
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:33,700
we'll make it pass easily.

195
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:35,419
He's just a kid.

196
00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:37,640
It's only normal that a kid has a diarrhea.

197
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,030
Mr. Yu.

198
00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:40,960
It's my own business.

199
00:08:41,429 --> 00:08:42,250
I won't put you to that trouble.

200
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:44,640
I have something to do. I have to go.

201
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:49,130
Mr. Zheng,

202
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:54,140
you may lose something

203
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:57,560
due to today's refusal.

204
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,480
We plan to make Lamb Chop with Lobsters

205
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:12,080
at the reopening.

206
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:14,990
Then we can create a blaze of publicity with the help of the media.

207
00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:16,490
In this way,

208
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:18,360
we can win the reputation and customers back.

209
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:28,100
What's wrong?

210
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:29,120
What do you think

211
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:30,200
of the plan I just proposed?

212
00:09:32,450 --> 00:09:33,000
Pretty good.

213
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:37,110
You were not listening at all.

214
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:42,550
Well, tell me again.

215
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:43,890
This time I'll listen carefully, okay?

216
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:48,260
I said

217
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:50,860
we plan to make Lamb Chop with Lobsters

218
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:52,940
again during the reopening.

219
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:55,640
Qi,

220
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,240
please give me the list of the media

221
00:09:57,270 --> 00:09:57,880
with which Isen has recently cooperated.

222
00:09:58,190 --> 00:09:58,740
Okay, a minute.

223
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:00,360
Tong.

224
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:01,530
I'm here, Frank.

225
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:03,570
My live streaming schedule this month is too tight.

226
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,280
Go and coordinate with our Party A companies.

227
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:07,340
Give me at least two free days.

228
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:08,030
Okay.

229
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:09,040
I'll contact them now.

230
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,230
Why do you suddenly want this?

231
00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:13,870
Is there any new activity to launch?

232
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,130
It's for the reopening of Si.

233
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:16,980
I plan to do an exclusive live streaming of it.

234
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,360
It was quite a big scandal.

235
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:19,130
Will we work

236
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:20,470
in vain?

237
00:10:20,590 --> 00:10:21,940
Don't say that.

238
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:23,150
It's reported that

239
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:24,770
Si was just shut down to reorganize

240
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:25,700
and to wait for the testing results.

241
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:27,150
It's not like the problem is confirmed.

242
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:29,790
When will it open exactly?

243
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,100
I don't know yet.

244
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:33,170
When the results are out,

245
00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:34,430
I'll let you know immediately.

246
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:35,110
Alright.

247
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:35,810
Go back to work.

248
00:10:35,930 --> 00:10:36,530
Go! Go!

249
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:37,010
Come on.

250
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:40,180
Compare the difference

251
00:10:40,210 --> 00:10:42,210
between this one and our live streaming equipment.

252
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:43,620
Then develop a plan

253
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:45,870
most suitable for Si's live streaming.

254
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,180
Make a list for me.

255
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:48,300
No, no, Mentor.

256
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:49,250
That's too much.

257
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:50,670
How long do I have to do this?

258
00:10:50,810 --> 00:10:51,100
I...

259
00:10:52,130 --> 00:10:52,680
Okay?

260
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:54,450
OKay.

261
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:55,470
I'll start now.

262
00:10:56,050 --> 00:10:56,990
Speaking of which,

263
00:10:57,130 --> 00:10:58,570
you're an old friend of Si.

264
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,990
Aren't you even willing to bend over backwards

265
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:01,740
for your friends?

266
00:11:02,210 --> 00:11:02,980
Of course I am!

267
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:05,730
I sure will spare no effort to help them.

268
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:07,720
But Mentor,

269
00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:09,320
when this case is over,

270
00:11:10,850 --> 00:11:11,960
would you like to come to my home for a visit?

271
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:15,490
To your home?

272
00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:22,150
Have some noodles at my place.

273
00:11:26,170 --> 00:11:27,230
Oh my!

274
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:27,950
What's wrong?

275
00:11:27,970 --> 00:11:30,280
The mysterious chef of S-S-Si!

276
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:31,110
What are you stuttering about?

277
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:31,980
What's wrong?

278
00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:33,350
"Chef Zheng Dao

279
00:11:33,530 --> 00:11:36,280
was expelled from European Gastronomy Association.

280
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:39,530
What's his ulterior secret?"

281
00:11:39,810 --> 00:11:41,290
"The mysterious chef of Si

282
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:43,510
finally unveiled his mythical veil

283
00:11:43,530 --> 00:11:44,950
in the Guan Guan poisoning incident.

284
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:48,010
It turns out to be Zheng Dao,

285
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:49,710
the Director of the top magazine Isen."

286
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:53,180
"He was expelled from European Food Association

287
00:11:53,490 --> 00:11:55,230
because he tricked the Association

288
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,020
and was accused of plagiarism in an important competition."

289
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:10,930
[The mysterious chef of Si finally unveiled his mythical veil in the Guan Guan poisoning incident.]

290
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:10,930
[It turns out to be Zheng Dao, the Director of the top magazine Isen.]

291
00:12:08,070 --> 00:12:08,670
"Therefore,

292
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:10,540
with Zheng Dao as Si's chef,

293
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,860
it's almost inevitable that a food safety accident occurred.

294
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:16,360
This time the poisoned victim is Guan Guan,

295
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:18,510
so this incident is covered widely by the media,

296
00:12:18,690 --> 00:12:19,610
hence a great impact.

297
00:12:20,050 --> 00:12:21,180
In our opinion,

298
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:24,640
this is the retribution Zheng Dao gets for his plagiarism."

299
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:28,300
Ying. Ying!

300
00:12:28,830 --> 00:12:29,290
Shen Ying.

301
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:31,350
Come here.

302
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:37,520
You want to see me?

303
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:39,550
When did you decide on the live streaming of Si?

304
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:40,630
Yesterday.

305
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:42,910
The live broadcast needs to go through a process to get approved.

306
00:12:43,290 --> 00:12:44,760
Sorry, it was urgent.

307
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:46,630
This live broadcast will definitely

308
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:47,780
draw a lot of attention for Isen.

309
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:49,710
You know that

310
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:51,310
both Si

311
00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:52,150
and Director Zheng

312
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,470
are in the very center of public opinion.

313
00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:54,270
Have you thought about it?

314
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:56,980
It is true that live streaming is risky.

315
00:12:57,380 --> 00:12:58,580
But I believe in Zheng Dao's moral standing.

316
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,310
The rumor will be clarified eventually.

317
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:01,960
And for Isen,

318
00:13:02,330 --> 00:13:04,520
we can take advantage of Zheng Dao and Si's popularity

319
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:05,980
to attract some fans.

320
00:13:06,270 --> 00:13:07,070
I also believe in Zheng Dao,

321
00:13:08,070 --> 00:13:09,420
whether as a colleague or a friend.

322
00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:13,430
I mean,

323
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,180
aren't you worried that

324
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:18,730
others will steal the exclusive broadcasting rights?

325
00:13:19,850 --> 00:13:20,440
Well...

326
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:21,390
No way.

327
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:23,380
The mysterious chef is Director Zheng.

328
00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:24,550
He would never

329
00:13:24,590 --> 00:13:26,460
authorize the live streaming rights to others.

330
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:33,000
You knew it, didn't you?

331
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,150
That's why you cooperated with Si?

332
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,520
I just found out.

333
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:39,010
I really just found out.

334
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:40,320
Really?

335
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:42,370
I swear.

336
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:44,310
Okay.

337
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:51,500
How could this be?

338
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:53,250
It was your fault!

339
00:13:53,490 --> 00:13:54,860
I was just telling the truth.

340
00:13:54,950 --> 00:13:55,660
Director Zheng,

341
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:56,590
have you read the latest news?

342
00:13:56,610 --> 00:13:57,170
Director Zheng,

343
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,110
is this report true?

344
00:13:58,140 --> 00:13:58,620
Mr. Zheng,

345
00:13:58,650 --> 00:13:59,540
do you have anything to say?

346
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:00,490
Will this report

347
00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:01,250
affect you in Isen?

348
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:01,680
Director Zheng,

349
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:02,990
before this report came out,

350
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:04,790
did Isen's readers know you are a chef?

351
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:05,800
Director Zheng, can you answer me?

352
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:06,640
Tell me.

353
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:07,720
Please answer

354
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:09,330
if this report is true.

355
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,240
Mr. Zheng, please answer.

356
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:12,030
Mr. Zheng, please answer.

357
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,510
Director Zheng.

358
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:15,280
Director Zheng.

359
00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:16,390
Please give us a response.

360
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:17,020
Director Zheng.

361
00:14:22,290 --> 00:14:23,020
I'm here.

362
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:36,960
Follow me.

363
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:43,040
I hope I can be the one

364
00:14:43,070 --> 00:14:44,780
who can help share some of your pressure.

365
00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:46,360
When you are in need,

366
00:14:48,090 --> 00:14:49,050
let me keep you company.

367
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,180
You are the person I want to see the most

368
00:14:53,890 --> 00:14:55,170
when I feel pressured.

369
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,190
I'm honored.

370
00:14:58,450 --> 00:14:59,050
Me too.

371
00:15:07,230 --> 00:15:07,700
Go ahead.

372
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:10,450
I'll urge the HR to approve your leave.

373
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:11,160
Don't worry about it.

374
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:12,210
Sir, please hurry up.

375
00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:13,750
Over there.

376
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:15,190
Mr. Zheng, please wait.

377
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:15,900
Mr. Zheng.

378
00:15:16,490 --> 00:15:17,290
Miss,

379
00:15:17,310 --> 00:15:18,410
what's your relationship with Mr. Zheng?

380
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:19,300
Miss,

381
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,890
can you answer for Mr. Zheng?

382
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:23,280
Miss, please answer us.

383
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,190
Miss, please answer my question.

384
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:26,760
Shen Ying went after Zheng Dao!

385
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:28,430
Shouldn't she?

386
00:15:28,810 --> 00:15:29,580
I mean

387
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:30,860
she went out

388
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:31,750
in such a hurry.

389
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:32,580
What should we do?

390
00:15:33,130 --> 00:15:34,450
Ying is an adult already.

391
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,700
What's wrong with that?

392
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:36,610
What could happen?

393
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:38,390
She's not your niece.

394
00:15:38,390 --> 00:15:39,270
Of course you're not worried.

395
00:15:40,450 --> 00:15:42,060
What do you mean?

396
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:42,560
What?

397
00:15:42,590 --> 00:15:43,450
So you are the only one that knows her well?

398
00:15:43,470 --> 00:15:44,360
I don't know her well?

399
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:45,100
Stop.

400
00:15:46,370 --> 00:15:46,960
How about this?

401
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,200
I'll take Frank down to have a look.

402
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:54,740
Take a good rest when you get back.

403
00:15:55,010 --> 00:15:56,570
We'll try our best to solve the problem.

404
00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:05,530
Dr Xu,

405
00:16:05,970 --> 00:16:07,110
Zheng Dao took a taxi home.

406
00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:08,670
Please keep an eye on his mental status for me.

407
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:11,350
Ying, are you okay?

408
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:12,630
I'm fine.

409
00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:13,710
-How's it? -Good you're fine.

410
00:16:13,710 --> 00:16:14,070
Let's go.

411
00:16:15,890 --> 00:16:16,190
Let's go.

412
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:20,720
Hello?

413
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:21,360
Hello,

414
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:21,920
Mr. Fang,

415
00:16:22,570 --> 00:16:23,490
we are informing you the of testing results.

416
00:16:23,610 --> 00:16:25,770
It turns out the number of bacteria groups has exceeded the standards.

417
00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:28,880
Therefore, you need to suspend your operation for three days.

418
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:30,830
Thank you.

419
00:16:31,050 --> 00:16:31,710
Thank you so much.

420
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:32,100
Thank you.

421
00:16:32,170 --> 00:16:32,570
You're welcome.

422
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:45,750
How is it?

423
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:47,400
The testing results are out.

424
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:48,820
Shutting down for three days.

425
00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:49,920
Three days?

426
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:51,290
Counting from yesterday,

427
00:16:51,430 --> 00:16:54,000
we can open the restaurant the day after tomorrow.

428
00:16:54,690 --> 00:16:55,020
Yes.

429
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,260
Okay, I'll inform everyone.

430
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:56,590
Okay.

431
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:57,360
Fang Siwei,

432
00:16:57,670 --> 00:16:58,560
it's already dark outside.

433
00:16:58,560 --> 00:16:59,470
I'm going to eat now.

434
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:00,730
Okay.

435
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:01,630
Hurry up, Xu Duo.

436
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:03,980
By the way, Dr Xu,

437
00:17:04,109 --> 00:17:05,069
do you want to have dinner together?

438
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:06,810
No, thanks.

439
00:17:06,829 --> 00:17:07,470
Well,

440
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:09,380
I have Zheng Dao's spare car key.

441
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:11,240
Shen Ying is coming to get it later.

442
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:12,130
You go first.

443
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:13,160
You're not eating?

444
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:16,530
Isn't there someone next door who hasn't eaten?

445
00:17:16,710 --> 00:17:17,470
I have to wait for him.

446
00:17:17,619 --> 00:17:18,030
Go ahead.

447
00:17:18,430 --> 00:17:18,760
Okay.

448
00:17:18,790 --> 00:17:19,740
Go and accompany Zheng Dao.

449
00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:21,000
-I'm not coming. -See you tomorrow.

450
00:17:21,690 --> 00:17:22,030
Bye.

451
00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:27,599
[The testing results are out. Si is opening up the day after tomorrow.]

452
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:31,540
Dr Xu.

453
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:32,330
You are here.

454
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:38,580
Here's the key.

455
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:39,730
Thank you.

456
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:40,310
Have some water.

457
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,600
What happened today?

458
00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:51,630
He was surrounded by reporters downstairs.

459
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:53,980
It's all because of the news.

460
00:17:54,210 --> 00:17:55,090
Was Zheng Dao okay?

461
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,330
When I dragged him out of the crowd,

462
00:17:57,830 --> 00:17:58,940
his hands were sweaty,

463
00:17:59,730 --> 00:18:00,800
and his eyes were dull.

464
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:02,310
That's why I was too worried

465
00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:03,430
to let him drive home alone.

466
00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:04,920
What you said about him

467
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:07,250
is not something new.

468
00:18:08,050 --> 00:18:09,650
Actually, I don't care

469
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:10,800
about his past.

470
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,820
But I want to help him get over it,

471
00:18:13,430 --> 00:18:14,710
so I need to learn about his past.

472
00:18:15,290 --> 00:18:16,080
He was never someone

473
00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:18,070
pouring out his grievances on others.

474
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:20,520
Promise me.

475
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:22,080
If I tell you the truth,

476
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:23,240
you won't get cross.

477
00:18:23,930 --> 00:18:25,290
I don't want do tough things that don't please anyone.

478
00:18:25,970 --> 00:18:26,650
Don't worry.

479
00:18:26,670 --> 00:18:27,790
I'm fully prepared.

480
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:33,660
He had a girlfriend

481
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:35,840
when he was abroad.

482
00:18:37,430 --> 00:18:38,190
She is

483
00:18:38,210 --> 00:18:39,540
a dessert chef.

484
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:42,490
They were quite close back then.

485
00:18:42,510 --> 00:18:44,210
They often studied dishes together.

486
00:18:44,610 --> 00:18:45,810
But that woman

487
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:48,210
wanted to migrate so badly

488
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:50,430
that she plagiarized Zheng Dao's new dish.

489
00:18:51,050 --> 00:18:51,930
She even betrayed him,

490
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:54,300
acting as if Zheng Dao had plagiarized her works.

491
00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:01,110
How could this happen?

492
00:19:01,630 --> 00:19:02,960
He really doesn't like explaining.

493
00:19:04,190 --> 00:19:05,930
He left without saying a word.

494
00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:07,360
You have no idea

495
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,530
how terrible the media coverage was at the time.

496
00:19:11,290 --> 00:19:12,220
So...

497
00:19:13,010 --> 00:19:17,410
Zheng Dao gets dizzy as soon as he enters the kitchen.

498
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:19,670
To put it bluntly,

499
00:19:20,330 --> 00:19:21,210
he was harmed so deeply

500
00:19:21,570 --> 00:19:22,360
that he's lost his sense of security.

501
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:23,420
I see.

502
00:19:24,550 --> 00:19:25,330
Have you lied?

503
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:26,130
Yes.

504
00:19:28,090 --> 00:19:29,150
I can't go into the kitchen.

505
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:30,790
Whenever I cook,

506
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:31,990
I will get dizzy,

507
00:19:32,430 --> 00:19:33,190
or even faint.

508
00:19:41,210 --> 00:19:42,380
This time I'll protect him.

509
00:19:46,330 --> 00:19:47,150
I get goosebumps

510
00:19:47,150 --> 00:19:48,270
on hearing your words.

511
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:50,270
It's so much trouble when straight people like you

512
00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:50,770
are in a relationship.

513
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:52,520
I have a date.

514
00:19:53,010 --> 00:19:53,470
I'm off now.

515
00:19:53,810 --> 00:19:54,960
Okay, I'll leave too.

516
00:19:55,990 --> 00:19:57,020
Remember to check on him for me.

517
00:19:57,340 --> 00:19:57,910
Okay.

518
00:19:58,090 --> 00:19:59,140
I'll talk to him tonight.

519
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:03,370
Hello, Ms. Ma.

520
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:05,310
There's a live broadcast tomorrow about Si's reopening.

521
00:20:05,310 --> 00:20:06,710
Can you report it, please?

522
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:08,390
Okay.

523
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:09,250
Thank you, Ms. Ma.

524
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:13,270
How is it?

525
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:15,930
Hello, Yi.

526
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:18,820
-Family, friends. -Do you know that Si is live broadcasting tomorrow?

527
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:20,710
Please support us and forward the post.

528
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:21,490
Thank you.

529
00:20:21,610 --> 00:20:23,370
At the same time tomorrow,

530
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:26,270
I'll wait for you in Isen's broadcasting room.

531
00:20:56,330 --> 00:20:56,790
Shen Ying?

532
00:20:58,460 --> 00:20:59,120
Are you okay?

533
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:00,940
I knocked for a long time but no one answered.

534
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:03,030
Nothing.

535
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:05,380
Oh, change your shoes.

536
00:21:09,330 --> 00:21:11,190
I thought you were not wearing any clothes

537
00:21:11,210 --> 00:21:11,940
like last time.

538
00:21:21,930 --> 00:21:23,100
Do you know

539
00:21:23,270 --> 00:21:25,240
they're making Lamb Chop with Lobsters at Si tomorrow?

540
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:26,730
I know it.

541
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:28,100
You'll go guide them, won't you?

542
00:21:34,990 --> 00:21:35,520
I...

543
00:21:44,690 --> 00:21:45,090
Have some water.

544
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:48,010
I'd better not.

545
00:21:51,370 --> 00:21:52,620
Aren't you the chef of Si?

546
00:21:53,330 --> 00:21:54,150
Who else will do it if you don't?

547
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:57,030
But it's useless for me to go.

548
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:58,540
I feel dizzy whenever I start to cook.

549
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:00,060
I still need Dong to cook.

550
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:07,510
Okay.

551
00:22:08,610 --> 00:22:10,830
Let's put aside the fact that the promotional point tomorrow

552
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:12,580
is that the chef of Si will cook himself.

553
00:22:13,610 --> 00:22:14,190
Let me ask you this.

554
00:22:14,870 --> 00:22:16,750
Who made Sweet Sago Cream with Coconut Milk and Cubilose

555
00:22:17,010 --> 00:22:17,620
last time?

556
00:22:20,370 --> 00:22:21,700
But I mistook salt for sugar.

557
00:22:21,890 --> 00:22:23,560
It was delicious even if you made the mistake.

558
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:24,540
Besides,

559
00:22:25,270 --> 00:22:27,050
the live broadcast tomorrow rectifies not only the name of Si,

560
00:22:28,490 --> 00:22:29,350
but also your reputation.

561
00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:35,350
I don't care about those rumors.

562
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:47,510
You won't shirk if you don't care, okay?

563
00:22:52,690 --> 00:22:53,120
Fine.

564
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:55,180
If you don't do it tomorrow,

565
00:22:55,450 --> 00:22:56,010
I'll do it.

566
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:06,340
Let me see the lobster.

567
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:09,230
This lobster...

568
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:12,670
I'll crush you first.

569
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,970
Shen Ying!

570
00:23:20,270 --> 00:23:22,160
You need to release urine from the lobster first.

571
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:23,820
Let me do it.

572
00:23:24,830 --> 00:23:25,230
Okay.

573
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:13,690
Xu Duo said

574
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,110
you lacked a sense of security.

575
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,040
In the future,

576
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:21,310
whenever you cook, I'll hold you.

577
00:24:22,130 --> 00:24:23,250
Will you feel secure this way?

578
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:30,640
Shen Ying,

579
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:32,730
do you want to learn

580
00:24:33,270 --> 00:24:34,130
about my past?

581
00:24:38,730 --> 00:24:40,620
I don't even want to ask the question

582
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:42,710
when the answer doesn't matter.

583
00:24:55,290 --> 00:24:57,410
How about... we make

584
00:24:58,470 --> 00:24:59,890
Lamb Chop with Lobsters first?

585
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:01,770
It can wait.

586
00:26:33,190 --> 00:26:33,780
Oh no!

587
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:34,650
I'm going to be late.

588
00:26:35,270 --> 00:26:37,230
I shouldn't have slept at your place last night.

589
00:26:38,490 --> 00:26:38,960
Shen Ying,

590
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:42,880
it's still early.

591
00:26:43,210 --> 00:26:43,680
You'll make it.

592
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:47,590
Let's snuggle for a while.

593
00:26:56,620 --> 00:26:57,340
Dear audience,

594
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:58,080
today,

595
00:26:58,120 --> 00:26:59,710
Restaurant Si which has been mired in the food poisoning scandal

596
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:00,660
is reopening.

597
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:03,260
The mysterious chef will come to cook himself.

598
00:27:03,290 --> 00:27:04,330
The boss will appear on camera

599
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:06,240
with the ace broadcaster Fan Jian.

600
00:27:06,450 --> 00:27:08,230
Mentor, I'm coming.

601
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:09,740
Dong.

602
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:10,770
You're here.

603
00:27:11,230 --> 00:27:12,040
Morning, Siwei.

604
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:16,250
Come with me to the kitchen.

605
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:16,660
Okay.

606
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:22,010
Hello, everyone.

607
00:27:22,090 --> 00:27:23,820
This is Youyou Live Stream sponsored by Shengshi Group.

608
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:26,000
Today, I’ll show you the aftermath of

609
00:27:26,430 --> 00:27:27,230
the biggest scandal in catering industry,

610
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:29,120
Guan Guan's food poisoning incident.

611
00:27:29,610 --> 00:27:30,090
We'll keep reporting on it.

612
00:27:30,110 --> 00:27:31,620
Mentor, what are you doing?

613
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:32,720
When the live broadcast starts,

614
00:27:32,750 --> 00:27:33,790
there will be a lot to do.

615
00:27:34,050 --> 00:27:35,370
Just wait and see.

616
00:27:51,470 --> 00:27:52,930
Hello, dude.

617
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:54,500
We're still preparing.

618
00:27:55,230 --> 00:27:56,040
What are you filming?

619
00:27:56,970 --> 00:27:57,930
I'm doing a warm-up.

620
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:58,880
Warm-up, eh?

621
00:27:58,910 --> 00:27:59,390
Sure.

622
00:27:59,930 --> 00:28:00,450
But

623
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:02,380
you need an invitation to shoot.

624
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:04,740
Yes, it's in my bag. Wait a minute.

625
00:28:11,170 --> 00:28:12,820
I forgot to bring it.

626
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:13,820
I'm so forgetful.

627
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:15,950
Can I call someone to send it over?

628
00:28:15,990 --> 00:28:16,790
But

629
00:28:16,990 --> 00:28:18,590
our invitations are all electronic.

630
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:19,790
What?

631
00:28:20,310 --> 00:28:21,190
You forgot your phone too?

632
00:28:22,030 --> 00:28:22,710
Alright, dude.

633
00:28:22,970 --> 00:28:23,690
Stop pretending.

634
00:28:24,410 --> 00:28:25,800
Please go back and tell them

635
00:28:26,130 --> 00:28:28,010
that we have no dirt here.

636
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:29,210
Okay.

637
00:28:29,930 --> 00:28:30,410
Please.

638
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:32,930
Okay, stop looking.

639
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:33,700
Please.

640
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:45,140
Hey, I can't get into Si.

641
00:28:45,730 --> 00:28:47,160
They've already known your trick.

642
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:49,520
Figure it out yourself.

643
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:50,390
Bye.

644
00:28:57,650 --> 00:28:58,820
Restaurant Si is opening soon.

645
00:28:58,860 --> 00:29:00,430
Let's wait and see

646
00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:01,620
if they can salvage their reputation.

647
00:29:01,650 --> 00:29:04,010
Stop the business! No reopening!

648
00:29:04,290 --> 00:29:07,190
Stop the business! No reopening!

649
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:10,480
Stop the business! No reopening!
