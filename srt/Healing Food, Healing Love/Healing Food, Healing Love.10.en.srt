[Episode 10]

3
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:47,830
Shen Ying is my partner tonight.

4
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:49,130
So what?

5
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:51,910
Shen Ying.

6
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:55,509
Director, you're here too.

7
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:56,370
What a coincidence.

8
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:00,750
I'm afraid it's not a coincidence.

9
00:02:02,470 --> 00:02:02,770
Let's go.

10
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,030
Just follow me.

11
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:05,230
It's crowded in there.

12
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:07,030
See you later.

13
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:07,530
Okay.

14
00:02:08,259 --> 00:02:08,729
See you later.

15
00:02:09,889 --> 00:02:10,560
Welcome.

16
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:17,450
Mr. Ye.

17
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:18,350
Please come in.

18
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:19,070
Mr. Zhou.

19
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:20,970
Long time no see.

20
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:22,070
Mr. Ye,

21
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:23,630
shall we review our schedule today?

22
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:24,829
Okay.

23
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:28,329
I'll get my work done.

24
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:30,420
Be good and stay around.

25
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:31,650
Have something to eat if you're hungry.

26
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:33,070
Don't worry.

27
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:34,250
I will take care of myself.

28
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:36,440
You sure you'll be fine on your own?

29
00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:37,880
Get to work.

30
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:39,670
I'm going there.

31
00:02:56,450 --> 00:02:57,970
Didn't he arrive at the same time as me?

32
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:01,720
Where's he now?

33
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:10,980
Director Zheng.

34
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:14,560
You look beautiful today.

35
00:03:17,829 --> 00:03:18,590
Thank you.

36
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:22,100
I don't usually like to dress this way.

37
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:24,450
It's inconvenient.

38
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:27,150
It suits you well.

39
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:28,140
If I had known,

40
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:29,770
I wouldn't have come out to socialize alone every time.

41
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:31,790
Are you inviting me in advance?

42
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:33,800
Is it effective?

43
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:37,200
I'll think about it.

44
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:39,390
A walk?

45
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,220
Your articles have improved lately.

46
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:45,710
Go!

47
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:46,740
Ultraman!

48
00:03:47,210 --> 00:03:47,850
Careful.

49
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:00,490
It's kind of a pity.

50
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:02,160
What is it?

51
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:04,370
Our swimming champion didn't get to

52
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:05,250
show her skills.

53
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,000
Is that all right?

54
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:15,010
Yeah.

55
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:17,660
Do you have a spare jacket?

56
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:20,370
I happen to have one at the back seat of my car.

57
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:22,320
I'll get it for you.

58
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:24,220
You can go to the bathroom to clean it up.

59
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:25,520
That'd be great.

60
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:26,340
Thank you.

61
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:28,860
You're welcome.

62
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:29,490
Go now.

63
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:36,960
Then everything will be better.

64
00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:39,210
Okay, we'll do as you said.

65
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:39,790
No problem.

66
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:43,930
Mr. Ye. Mr. Ye?

67
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:11,400
You'll make me worry if you drink too much.

68
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:12,930
I'm her boyfriend.

69
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:15,420
Excuse me!

70
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:15,780
Tell me...

71
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:16,160
Be careful!

72
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:16,630
Be careful.

73
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:21,820
Shen Ying.

74
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:25,960
What are you going to do?

75
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:26,900
Change it to something that...

76
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,050
-only needs whipping cream. -only needs whipping cream.

77
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,700
Next, let's welcome the star of the evening,

78
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:51,100
Mr. Ye Zhiqiu.

79
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:55,760
Thank you.

80
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:58,110
Mr. Ye,

81
00:05:58,300 --> 00:05:59,659
why did you want to work in the dessert industry

82
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,690
and how did you get started?

83
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:05,080
Mr. Ye?

84
00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:12,870
I fell for a girl

85
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:15,170
when I was little.

86
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:18,250
She loved desserts.

87
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:20,650
And then,

88
00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:22,930
she became

89
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:25,920
the greatest motivation for my efforts and hard work.

90
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:32,770
Have you ever thought about dating her

91
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:34,010
and starting a relationship?

92
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:36,890
Shen Ying,

93
00:06:37,450 --> 00:06:38,580
you told me

94
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:40,030
to be confident

95
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:42,130
and to trust myself.

96
00:06:42,909 --> 00:06:45,500
You gave me a lot of courage,

97
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:49,820
including the courage to express my feelings to you today.

98
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:51,670
It was you

99
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:53,830
who made me want to be a better person.

100
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,330
Are you such a fool?

101
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:12,140
I'm just kidding.

102
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:13,550
Don't take it seriously.

103
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,250
Otherwise,

104
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:17,340
you'll hold a grudge again.

105
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:23,150
I know you were kidding.

106
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:24,410
I won't take it seriously.

107
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:28,240
But I'll still hold a grudge

108
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:30,050
for the rest of my life.

109
00:07:30,770 --> 00:07:31,620
Please do.

110
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:36,530
Got you there, haven't I?

111
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,240
I'll take the flowers

112
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,030
and forgive you.

113
00:07:42,450 --> 00:07:43,380
Best buddies for life.

114
00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:48,940
I lost again.

115
00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:00,570
Because of her,

116
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:04,360
I was willing to devote myself

117
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:05,280
to my dessert career.

118
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:07,250
And now,

119
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:10,620
we've both become a better person.

120
00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:15,080
I have no regrets in my youth.

121
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:16,770
So I will cherish this love

122
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:17,890
forever.

123
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:20,460
Compared with keeping her by my side,

124
00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:23,810
I'd rather see her being with

125
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:26,630
the person she really wants to be with.

126
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:30,200
So what's next for you?

127
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:30,990
Next,

128
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,120
I'm going back to Italy.

129
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:36,500
I have a lot of work to do there.

130
00:08:37,659 --> 00:08:38,110
Shen Ying,

131
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:39,580
you must be tired.

132
00:08:41,179 --> 00:08:41,720
I'm fine.

133
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:43,580
Do you still have my car key?

134
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:47,360
Yes. Here.

135
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:49,720
There's a pair of flats in the passenger seat.

136
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,060
Go change into them and wait for me.

137
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,230
There's something I need to take care of.

138
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:56,080
Okay.

139
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:03,850
I'm grateful for this past journey,

140
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:05,620
which brought me many new experiences.

141
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:07,280
Thank you.

142
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:07,990
Okay.

143
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:09,740
Thank you, Mr. Ye, for sharing your story.

144
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:11,500
Bye.

145
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:12,370
See you next time.

146
00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:21,020
Let's have a chat.

147
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:22,260
Sorry, I need to drive.

148
00:10:05,210 --> 00:10:06,640
How did he know my shoe size?

149
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:08,520
The girl you were talking about

150
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:09,410
is Shen Ying, right?

151
00:10:10,030 --> 00:10:11,060
Why did you say

152
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:12,620
you'd let her be with someone else?

153
00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:14,590
It's not that I don't want to be with her.

154
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:16,830
But...

155
00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:23,700
It's okay.

156
00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:25,150
No need to comfort me.

157
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,040
Now I think

158
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:30,770
being her best friend is enough.

159
00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:33,230
I'm your friend, too.

160
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:40,390
Promise me,

161
00:10:41,890 --> 00:10:43,410
if the person she loves is you,

162
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,450
you won't let her down.

163
00:10:50,610 --> 00:10:51,440
Tell me the truth.

164
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,720
Who gave my shoe size to Zheng Dao?

165
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:55,100
It wasn't me.

166
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:55,670
Nor me.

167
00:10:55,930 --> 00:10:57,220
I only gave it to Ye Zhiqiu.

168
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:01,000
Could it be Ye Zhiqiu?

169
00:11:01,210 --> 00:11:02,160
No way.

170
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:04,200
He's not such a fool.

171
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:06,300
I remember now.

172
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:08,490
The shoes Ye Zhiqiu gave you last time

173
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:10,780
were kept at the reception the whole morning.

174
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:13,100
Director saw the shoe box when Fan Jian went to get them.

175
00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:24,080
Thank you for the shoes.

176
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:26,460
So...

177
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:28,240
how much do I owe you?

178
00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:31,520
Did you pay him

179
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:33,090
for the dress he bought you?

180
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:35,210
How do you know about the dress?

181
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,800
Anything I want to know, I get to know it.

182
00:12:38,690 --> 00:12:39,980
How arrogant.

183
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:46,630
Anyway, thank you.

184
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:49,030
Let me treat you to dinner sometime.

185
00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:50,270
Okay.

186
00:13:05,830 --> 00:13:06,750
I'll go up now.

187
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:08,520
Again,

188
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,330
thank you for everything you did for me today.

189
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:13,220
I didn't really do anything.

190
00:13:14,070 --> 00:13:14,870
You saved me.

191
00:13:14,890 --> 00:13:15,880
You gave me these shoes.

192
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:17,730
Otherwise, my feet would have been ruined.

193
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:23,770
But that time when I saved you at the bar,

194
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:25,970
you didn't seem to appreciate it.

195
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:29,040
Who'd think you were saving me when you

196
00:13:29,070 --> 00:13:30,010
took me to the hotel?

197
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,340
I thought you were...

198
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:35,570
You thought I was a pervert?

199
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:37,690
Or what else?

200
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,110
Anyone who wakes up seeing that scene

201
00:13:40,130 --> 00:13:41,250
would be scared, okay?

202
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:44,680
Okay.

203
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:47,120
Anyway,

204
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:48,820
promise me

205
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:51,720
you won't go out drinking on your own, okay?

206
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:54,500
I promise.

207
00:14:01,490 --> 00:14:02,570
It's getting late.

208
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:06,810
I... I'll go now.

209
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:33,650
I... wanted to open the door for you.

210
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:39,280
Thank you.

211
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:43,850
I-I'll get going then.

212
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:45,340
Okay.

213
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:55,300
Bye.

214
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:18,030
Happy?

215
00:15:20,530 --> 00:15:21,260
Sort of. Yeah.

216
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:22,410
Why?

217
00:15:24,010 --> 00:15:25,250
I forgot the shoe box.

218
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:28,800
Right. Here.

219
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:32,900
In the future,

220
00:15:34,270 --> 00:15:35,430
you'll be happier.

221
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:37,570
Really?

222
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:41,780
Shen Ying.

223
00:15:48,770 --> 00:15:49,820
Nothing. Go.

224
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:57,050
Good night.

225
00:15:57,820 --> 00:15:58,260
Good night.

226
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:23,080
[Restaurant Si]

227
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:31,080
You do have hollow legs.

228
00:16:36,690 --> 00:16:37,870
Sweet Sago Cream with Coconut Milk and Cubilose.

229
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:39,530
Have a try.

230
00:16:46,650 --> 00:16:47,720
You look proficient.

231
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:49,280
Are you...

232
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:53,090
I don't want to admit it,

233
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:54,770
but I can't deny it.

234
00:16:58,060 --> 00:16:58,690
Chef Zheng.

235
00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:01,090
Does Shen Ying know?

236
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:02,440
Not yet.

237
00:17:04,510 --> 00:17:04,960
Try it.

238
00:17:08,470 --> 00:17:09,310
Tell me what you think.

239
00:17:16,430 --> 00:17:17,660
Fine lotus root powder

240

paired with mellow coconut milk

241
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:23,400
and bitter almonds.

242
00:17:23,819 --> 00:17:25,720
Sweet and bitter all at the same time.

243
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:27,490
It can really melt...

244
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:30,330
the pain in my heart.

245
00:17:30,910 --> 00:17:32,170
Great healing effect.

246
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:42,440
You are indeed an excellent dessert chef.

247
00:17:43,210 --> 00:17:43,650
It's been a pleasure.

248
00:17:53,230 --> 00:17:55,360
Are you enjoying your handshake?

249
00:17:57,810 --> 00:17:58,050
Here.

250
00:17:58,870 --> 00:18:00,100
To you. Pardon my Coke.

251
00:18:07,210 --> 00:18:07,830
Zheng Dao,

252
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:11,260
if you fail to do right by Shen Ying,

253
00:18:12,790 --> 00:18:15,380
I'll fly right back.

254
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:18,420
I'll have the courage

255
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:21,530
to get her back.

256
00:18:24,030 --> 00:18:24,560
Don't worry.

257
00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:26,220
With or without you around,

258
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:27,500
I will cherish her

259
00:18:27,810 --> 00:18:28,380
and do right by her.

260
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:30,930
You can go back without any worry.

261
00:18:34,590 --> 00:18:35,090
Right.

262
00:18:35,770 --> 00:18:36,840
She doesn't need me anymore.

263
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:38,550
I'll go back to

264
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:41,000
where I'm needed.

265
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:56,320
Go easy on that.

266
00:18:57,090 --> 00:18:58,370
Fang, keep an eye on him.

267
00:18:58,390 --> 00:18:59,030
I'll make some tea.

268
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:14,740
Hello, Chubby.

269
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:15,430
Hello, Ying.

270
00:19:16,570 --> 00:19:17,780
Listen...

271
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:18,890
Are you drunk?

272
00:19:18,910 --> 00:19:19,460
Don't.

273
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:20,160
You've drunk enough.

274
00:19:20,570 --> 00:19:21,400
Put down the bottle.

275
00:19:22,410 --> 00:19:23,130
Mr. Fang?

276
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:24,440
-You're at Si? -Ying.

277
00:19:25,010 --> 00:19:27,930
Zheng Dao really is a good guy.

278
00:19:28,630 --> 00:19:29,710
Be sure

279
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:32,300
to drink with him when the opportunity arises.

280
00:19:33,770 --> 00:19:35,320
He is a good guy.

281
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:39,420
No wonder

282
00:19:41,050 --> 00:19:42,470
I got outdone.

283
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:44,810
You're drinking with Zheng Dao?

284
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:45,290
Yeah.

285
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:46,840
Come drink with us.

286
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:47,990
All right now.

287
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:49,500
You're drunk.

288
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:51,220
Hello?

289
00:19:51,570 --> 00:19:52,240
Ying!

290
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:52,590
Ying.

291
00:19:52,590 --> 00:19:53,790
Come drink with us!

292
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:54,680
Fang Siwei is speaking.

293
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:56,060
He's drunk.

294
00:19:57,370 --> 00:19:58,060
No.

295
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:09,890
Oh no.

296
00:20:11,450 --> 00:20:12,070
What's wrong?

297
00:20:13,530 --> 00:20:15,590
I don't want Shen Ying to know that I'm...

298
00:20:16,290 --> 00:20:17,230
She still doesn't know?

299
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:20,960
It doesn't really matter, does it?

300
00:20:23,130 --> 00:20:24,030
Anyway, we'll play it by ear

301
00:20:24,150 --> 00:20:24,950
when she gets here.

302
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:37,990
Thank you, sir.

303
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:41,200
Be careful.

304
00:20:41,230 --> 00:20:42,020
I'm not drunk.

305
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:42,760
See?

306
00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:44,120
I'm fine really.

307
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:45,340
There you are.

308
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:46,960
Here. Let me.

309
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:51,020
I think I'm hallucinating.

310
00:20:53,090 --> 00:20:54,590
Doesn't she look like Ying?

311
00:20:54,890 --> 00:20:55,810
You know where his place is?

312
00:20:55,970 --> 00:20:57,020
No, I don't.

313
00:20:58,720 --> 00:20:59,890
Should we take him to a hotel?

314
00:21:00,650 --> 00:21:02,530
No, it's too dangerous for him to be left alone.

315
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:04,110
Don't worry,

316
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:04,740
I'll take care of him.

317
00:21:04,770 --> 00:21:05,410
No!

318
00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:09,960
It's not very sensible for you two to share a room.

319
00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:11,080
I'll do it.

320
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:12,820
He can stay at my place.

321
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:14,810
-Gimme that. -Wouldn't it be inconvenient?

322
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:16,110
Nope, no more of that.

323
00:21:16,450 --> 00:21:17,190
-My place it is. -Gimme that.

324
00:21:17,210 --> 00:21:17,900
Let's go.

325
00:21:19,190 --> 00:21:19,900
Let's go.

326
00:21:20,490 --> 00:21:21,580
Thank you, Mr. Fang.

327
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:22,190
Bye.

328
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:24,130
Bye.

329
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:31,660
Be careful.

330
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:37,440
Watch his head.

331
00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:38,230
Here.

332
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:41,990
Have some water.

333
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:49,550
Ying,

334
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:50,870
do you remember,

335
00:21:51,050 --> 00:21:52,710
when you injured your leg in a track and field event

336
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:54,050
in primary school,

337
00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:57,960
who carried you to the infirmary?

338
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:00,820
Have you forgotten

339
00:22:00,990 --> 00:22:01,720
our beautiful memories?

340
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:02,660
Don't get me started.

341
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:04,690
I was a track and field champion at school.

342
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:05,660
Why did I get hurt?

343
00:22:06,330 --> 00:22:08,090
You couldn't run, so I did it for you!

344
00:22:10,210 --> 00:22:11,940
I had to have my hair cropped,

345
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:13,870
and was asked to run 100 laps as punishment.

346
00:22:14,330 --> 00:22:15,770
And now you have the nerve to bring it up!

347
00:22:16,790 --> 00:22:17,430
Drink your water.

348
00:22:19,650 --> 00:22:20,840
Ying,

349
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:22,720
don't leave me.

350
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,440
How am I supposed to manage...

351
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:25,330
-without you? -There, there.

352
00:22:25,350 --> 00:22:26,370
That's enough now.

353
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:27,720
Let go of her.

354
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:29,460
Shen Ying,

355
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:30,270
I'll take care of him.

356
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:31,190
Go ahead.

357
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:31,830
Leave it to me.

358
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:39,620
Still sick?

359
00:22:41,490 --> 00:22:42,130
Go rinse it off.

360
00:22:45,830 --> 00:22:47,200
Damn it, Chubby!

361
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:49,390
I'm so gonna kill you!
