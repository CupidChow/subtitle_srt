I think it is too greasy.

201
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:52,270


202
00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:52,400
We should add some vegetables.

214
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:00,340

216
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:03,530

218
00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:05,790
like she is my ex-girlfriend to whom I owe.

220
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:06,880
How can I do business like this?

221

222
00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:08,060
How about this?

223
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:09,310


224
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:09,380
Chef Dong,

Miss Shen.

231
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:22,550


232
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,630
This is black pepper steak

233
00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:23,270


234
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:23,300
that the chefs especially made for you.

235
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:26,630


236

240
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:32,850
One main dish is fine as well.

241
00:06:43,530 --> 00:06:44,740
I told you this restaurant's meals are delicious.

242
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:44,750


243
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:45,380
Try this.

244
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:45,390


245
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:46,030


246
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,120
Have it yourself.

247
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:48,830


248
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:48,950
Look, girls.

250
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:51,350
This time, I am taking the main dish of Si.

251

252
00:06:55,370 --> 00:06:56,460
It's just an interview.

253
00:06:56,470 --> 00:06:57,870


254
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:57,970
Why do you do it little by little?

255
00:06:58,230 --> 00:06:59,790


256
00:06:58,350 --> 00:06:59,770
It doesn't match your ability.

257
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:07,030


258
00:07:05,450 --> 00:07:06,950
It's good that I have a chance to enjoy it though.

259
00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:10,070


260
00:07:07,770 --> 00:07:10,010
I'll definitely get the interview done today.

262
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:45,320
According to what I've learned about from your work

263

so that to spread the superior quality content

279
00:07:59,690 --> 00:08:01,120
on all platforms with matrix marketing.

280
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:01,740


281
00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:01,900
Besides,

we desperately need

284
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:05,230


285
00:08:03,970 --> 00:08:05,330
to improve our professional knowledge.

286
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:07,670


287
00:08:06,170 --> 00:08:07,770
We need to know the place of origin of the ingredients,

288
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:08,910


289
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,040
the cooking skills

290
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:10,110


291
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,210
and the chefs' philosophies.

292

293
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,150
To attract our target audience,

295
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:14,430
we must be very professional.

296

297
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,000
I have to remind you

298
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:17,350


299
00:08:16,290 --> 00:08:17,440
not to underestimate cooking.

300
00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:20,260


301
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:20,250
Ying needs to read papers

302
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:21,500


303
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:21,550
before she writes from now on.

304
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:24,340
If he wants me to write

305
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:24,350


306
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:26,390


307
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:26,400
how long it takes to make fermented bean curd,

308
00:08:26,770 --> 00:08:27,900
I'll resign tomorrow.

309

310
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:37,390


311
00:08:34,929 --> 00:08:37,620
Making magazines is different from academic research.

312
00:08:38,789 --> 00:08:39,470


313
00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:39,570
Director Zheng,

I hope for the first three issues,

318
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:45,070


319
00:08:43,659 --> 00:08:45,140
we can give up advertising revenue for now

320
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:46,430


321
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:46,500
to keep our professionalism.

322
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:48,150


323
00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:48,210
We still need to consider commercialism.

324
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:49,700


325
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:49,790
After all, commercialism

326
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:51,230


327
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:51,220
is a prerequisite for a virtuous circle.

328
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:52,070


329
00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:52,130
I understand that.

330
00:08:52,590 --> 00:08:53,510


331
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:53,620
Giving up the profits of the first three issues

332
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:54,740


333
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:54,820
is only temporary.

334
00:08:55,310 --> 00:08:56,590


335
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:56,620
I want to establish our brand.

336
00:08:57,350 --> 00:08:58,430


337
00:08:57,380 --> 00:08:58,460
Only when our positioning is accurate

338
00:08:58,590 --> 00:08:59,550


339
00:08:58,660 --> 00:08:59,630
can we realize a win-win situation.

340
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:00,550


341
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:00,700
Oh, yes.

342
00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:02,710


343
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:02,780
I also wish our colleagues in the Investment Inviting Department

344
00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:03,870


345
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:03,970
can make a new plan to attract investment

346
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:05,470


347
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:05,550
based on our adjustments.

348
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:07,830


349
00:09:07,090 --> 00:09:07,890
For the new issue,

350
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:09,110


351
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,190
the topic is essential.

352
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:10,630


353
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:10,680
I hope you can

354
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:11,590


355

make your projects well.

356
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:12,870


357
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:12,950
You could come to me anytime.

358
00:09:13,310 --> 00:09:14,300


359
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:14,380
I will choose the best.

360
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:15,630


361
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:15,730
That's all for today.

362
00:09:15,950 --> 00:09:16,350


363
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:16,430
You're dismissed.

365
00:09:26,010 --> 00:09:26,740
Director, take a look.

366
00:09:26,830 --> 00:09:27,870


367
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:27,910
This is Namo’s molecular gastronomy.

368
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:30,150


369
00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:30,210

Legend has it that

424
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:57,590


425
00:10:55,950 --> 00:10:57,670
there was a rich family in Suzhou

426
00:10:57,950 --> 00:10:59,590


427
00:10:58,010 --> 00:10:59,640
which had a maid named Begonia.

429
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:01,710
One day, Begonia had a crazy idea,

430
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:03,430


431
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,520
covering red bean pastes with flour

433
00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:04,710
and roasting them on concave brass plates.

434
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:06,390


435
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:06,420
After that,

436
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:08,550


437
00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:08,610
she added all kinds of sweet ingredients

438
00:11:08,950 --> 00:11:10,630


439
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:10,660
and the cakes attracted the ten-year-old young master

440
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:11,510


441
00:11:10,690 --> 00:11:11,490
in the family.

442
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:13,070


443
00:11:12,310 --> 00:11:13,150
Since then,

444
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:14,780


445
00:11:13,290 --> 00:11:14,850
the young master fell in love with this dessert.

446
00:11:15,830 --> 00:11:17,390


447
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:17,430
He had the cakes every day

448
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:18,510


449
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:18,590
and didn't take meals.

450
00:11:19,270 --> 00:11:20,860


451
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:20,940
Later, the family found out

452
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:22,590


453
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,680
it was because of Begonia's cakes.

454
00:11:23,270 --> 00:11:25,070


455
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:25,160
So, Begonia was ordered to stop making the cakes.

456
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:27,270


457
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:27,350
But the young master fell ill

458
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:28,750


459
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,800
when he lost the cakes.

460
00:11:29,710 --> 00:11:30,540


461
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:30,610
The host had to

462
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:32,910


463
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,990
ask Begonia to make the dessert again.

464
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:34,470


465
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:34,500
It turned out that

466
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:35,380


467
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:35,410
as soon as the young master got the cakes,

468
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:37,150


469
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:37,230
he recovered indeed.

470
00:11:38,110 --> 00:11:39,230


471
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,240
The master was so elated

472
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:40,750


473
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:40,780
that he rewarded this girl called Begonia.

474

475
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:43,540
Therefore, there is a dessert

476
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:45,260


477
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,360
named Begonia Cake.

00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:37,290
Okay.

554
00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:37,950


555
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:38,020
But remember,

556
00:13:38,510 --> 00:13:39,790


557
00:13:38,570 --> 00:13:39,850
no advertisement.

558
00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:42,030


559
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:41,990
We need to keep our articles neutral.

560
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:42,910


561
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:43,000
Okay, Director.

562
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:44,430
But Bu'erhui

563
00:13:44,430 --> 00:13:45,590


564
00:13:44,450 --> 00:13:45,610
is the first important topic

565
00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:46,670


566
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:46,720
of the Gourmet.

567
00:13:47,270 --> 00:13:48,390


568
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:48,350
If the client insists

569
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:50,020
that he won't receive the interview without the ad,

570
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:49,990


571
00:13:50,270 --> 00:13:51,390


572
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:51,420
we can't turn him down, right?

573
00:13:51,390 --> 00:13:53,350


574
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:53,450
But I trust your ability.

575
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:55,210
This isn't a hard thing

576
00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:55,220


577
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:56,020
to you, right?

578
00:13:55,270 --> 00:13:56,030


579
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:14,490
[Mom]

580
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:15,350


581
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,400
Hello, Mom.

582
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:17,070


583
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:17,110
Ying.

584
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:18,790


585
00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:18,740
Have you had dinner yet?

586
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:20,110


587
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,160
Not yet.

588
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:20,990


589
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:21,060
I'll eat it later.

590
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:21,710


591
00:14:21,170 --> 00:14:21,780
Okay.

592
00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:23,910


593
00:14:22,170 --> 00:14:23,880
Have dinner early next time.

594
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:25,430


595
00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:25,550
Ying.

596
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:27,750


597
00:14:25,950 --> 00:14:27,790
Your dad and I

598
00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:30,470


599
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:30,500
want to visit you and live there for a few days.

600
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:32,310


601
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,420
I'll cook for you

602
00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:33,510


603
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:33,560
and tidy up your house.

604
00:14:34,190 --> 00:14:35,780


605
00:14:34,330 --> 00:14:35,800
It's okay, mom. I'm fine.

606
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:40,150


607
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:40,210
Uncle takes good care of me.

608
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:41,870


609
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:42,030
Right, Ying,

610
00:14:42,270 --> 00:14:43,750


611
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:43,760
do you still have leaves this year?

612
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:45,150


613
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:45,220
Do you want to take a leave

614
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:47,270


615
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:47,310
and travel for a relax?

616
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:49,230


617
00:14:48,050 --> 00:14:49,290
Sis, I want to go as well.

618
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:51,310


619
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:51,360
Let me help you beat that scumbag.

620
00:14:52,590 --> 00:14:53,190


621
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:53,240
Come on.

622
00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:54,870


623
00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:54,950
Prepare for your exams first.

624
00:14:54,990 --> 00:14:56,510


625
00:14:55,050 --> 00:14:56,570
Don't worry about me.

626
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:58,750


627
00:14:57,770 --> 00:14:58,810
He's just causing trouble.

628
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:00,820


629
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:00,880
If you are unhappy

630
00:15:00,950 --> 00:15:02,950


631
00:15:01,050 --> 00:15:02,870
living in the big city,

632
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:04,230
you can come back.

633
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:05,990


634
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,080
Although our city is small,

635
00:15:06,190 --> 00:15:07,670


636
00:15:06,270 --> 00:15:07,750
you can still make a living

637
00:15:07,710 --> 00:15:09,020


638
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:09,090
if you pass the civil servant exam.

639
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:11,150


640
00:15:10,030 --> 00:15:11,180
Okay, mom, I got it.

641
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:13,710


642
00:15:12,770 --> 00:15:13,730
I have something else to do.

643
00:15:13,710 --> 00:15:14,670


644
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:14,720
I'll talk to you later.

645
00:15:15,510 --> 00:15:16,990


646
00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:17,070
Hello, is that Princess Elsa?

647
00:15:20,830 --> 00:15:22,470


648
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,530
Hello, this is Princess Elsa.

649
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:23,980
Okay.

650
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:23,990


651
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:24,950


652
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:24,980
Just put it downstairs for me.

653
00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:26,150


654
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,240
I'll ask my knight to get it.

655
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:26,430


656
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:26,490
OK.

657
00:15:26,430 --> 00:15:27,070


658
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:27,160
Okay, thank you.

659
00:15:28,830 --> 00:15:29,620


660
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:29,670
Knight Zhuang.

661
00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:30,710


662
00:15:30,050 --> 00:15:30,810
Please go fetch it.

663
00:15:32,990 --> 00:15:34,460


664
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:34,530
Will you die if you ask the deliveryman

665
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:36,350


666
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:36,210
send it here?

667
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:39,430


668
00:15:37,390 --> 00:15:39,480
Fan is worried that someone will plot against him,

669
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:41,230


670
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:41,300
so he asked me to leave the address limited to the building.

671
00:15:41,630 --> 00:15:42,430


672
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:42,480
What are you talking about?

673
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:44,030


674
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:44,060
Aren't you two princesses?

675
00:15:44,950 --> 00:15:46,990


676
00:15:45,010 --> 00:15:47,020
You should be more careful.

677
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:48,670


678
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:48,680
What if you are abducted?

679
00:15:48,950 --> 00:15:50,510


680
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,550
Then go get it yourself.

681
00:15:50,830 --> 00:15:51,710


682
00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:51,680
Princess Elsa!

683
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:54,070


684
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:54,060
Go. Hurry up, Knight Fan.

685
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:55,560
I've fed you for nothing, lazy bugs!

686
00:15:54,070 --> 00:15:55,510


687
00:15:57,270 --> 00:15:58,150
Go!

688
00:15:57,310 --> 00:15:58,110


689
00:15:58,110 --> 00:15:59,510


690
00:15:58,170 --> 00:15:59,520
Cheers!

691
00:16:06,510 --> 00:16:07,390


692
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:07,540
I saw it first.

693
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:08,830


694
00:16:07,930 --> 00:16:08,940
I got it first.

695
00:16:08,990 --> 00:16:10,270


696
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:10,140
I saw it first.

697
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:22,550


698
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:22,600
There's a message in the group chat.

699
00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:24,270


700
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:24,330
Miranda sent a message.

701
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:25,070


702
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:25,120
What did she say?

703
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:29,710


704
00:16:26,190 --> 00:16:29,700
She said, "Shen Ying is doing well recently."

705
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:31,550


706
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:31,610
"I hope you can continue."

707
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:33,820
It would be great

708
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:33,830


709
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:35,360
if all the bosses are as nice as Miranda.

710
00:16:33,830 --> 00:16:35,430


711
00:16:36,590 --> 00:16:38,230


712
00:16:36,610 --> 00:16:38,250
Why do I smell a henchman?

713
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:41,010
-Go away. -I smell it as well.

714
00:16:39,190 --> 00:16:39,710


715
00:16:39,710 --> 00:16:40,510


716
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:45,300
Again?

717
00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:45,310


718
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:46,740
Miranda said,

719
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:46,750


720
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:49,460
"There is a formal business dinner tomorrow."

721
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:49,470


722
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:50,630


723
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:50,620
She asked you to go with her.

724
00:16:52,510 --> 00:16:53,390


725
00:16:52,570 --> 00:16:53,450
Oh, my.

726
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:56,350


727
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:56,340
The star employee is going out to socialize.

728
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:57,260
How about this?

729
00:16:56,830 --> 00:16:57,150


730
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:59,140
Let me be your stylist tomorrow.

731
00:16:57,310 --> 00:16:59,150


732
00:16:59,490 --> 00:17:00,970
I'll make you look beautiful for sure.

733
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:00,990


734
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:02,130
