[Episode 23]

4
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:45,039
Come on in.

5
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:52,229
What?

6
00:01:52,610 --> 00:01:53,810
Won't you give me a hug?

7
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:05,400
Stop thinking about the Golden Fritillaria Competition.

8
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:07,270
I've already forgotten it.

9
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:09,669
Let's celebrate.

10
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:10,870
Okay.

11
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:14,310
Why are you so low in spirits?

12
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:17,510
Because

13
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,490
I've never mentioned

14
00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:21,970
my past related to Han Feizi to you.

15
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:24,650
I don't care about your past.

16
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:26,100
What I want is your future.

17
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:28,260
Okay.

18
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:30,500
Besides,

19
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:34,930
I don't want to miss you because of this little misunderstanding.

20
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:37,390
You're the most important person to me.

21
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:39,360
I don't want to lose you.

22
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:45,850
What are you doing?

23
00:02:56,290 --> 00:02:57,170
By the way, Shen Ying,

24
00:02:57,710 --> 00:02:58,660
where is Miranda?

25
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:00,530
Why haven't I seen her lately?

26
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,860
I accepted the headhunter's suggestion.

27
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:06,510
I plan to leave Isen.

28
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:09,510
You'd better seize this opportunity.

29
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:12,520
She...

30
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,210
Maybe something came up at home.

31
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:26,550
Come with me to do some fieldwork.

32
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:27,680
I'll wait for you downstairs.

33
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:30,020
Director Zheng and I are going out for some fieldwork.

34
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:31,100
If you don't have other things,

35
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:32,020
go back to work.

36
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:32,950
Okay.

37
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:38,340
They're already like this,

38
00:03:39,329 --> 00:03:39,920
but we're all still pretending.

39
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:41,100
Exactly.

40
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:43,340
Both Shen Ying and Director Zheng are shy.

41
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:45,079
Just pretend we don't know.

42
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:46,230
Just pretend.

43
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:48,130
They're not kids anymore.

44
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:50,300
Right on.

45
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:51,220
Alright.

46
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:52,770
Let's all go back to work.

47
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:53,780
Go back to work.

48
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:54,610
Work.

49
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:55,260
Let's go.

50
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:06,930
Look what I prepared.

51
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:10,260
Let me put it on for you.

52
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:13,780
Are we going to ride this today

53
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:14,370
instead of driving?

54
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:15,100
Yes,

55
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:16,290
because I saw other couples

56
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:18,120
ride this to go have delicious food.

57
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:19,980
Perfect.

58
00:04:20,170 --> 00:04:20,480
Let's go.

59
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:33,030
Ma'am,

60
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:35,650
your purse is so beautiful.

61
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:43,800
Mom.

62
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:44,980
What are you doing?

63
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,000
Take it back.

64
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:47,360
Shut up!

65
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:49,710
It's not your turn to talk.

66
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,360
Here's five million.

67
00:04:57,980 --> 00:04:59,820
Yu Sicheng loves you so much.

68
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:01,180
So,

69
00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:04,950
I think tomorrow is a good day.

70
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:07,380
Let's go and get the marriage certificate first.

71
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:10,490
Then I'll have a good daughter-in-law.

72
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:12,380
No, Ma'am.

73
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:14,420
I think this is all too sudden.

74
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:15,670
I'm not ready yet.

75
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:16,780
How could you call it sudden?

76
00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:18,170
You two have been together

77
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:19,970
for a long period of time.

78
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:21,830
It's not sudden at all.

79
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:25,020
One part of this money

80
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:27,210
is used to buy you a wedding house.

81
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:30,030
It's up to your taste.

82
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:31,230
The other part

83
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,540
can be used as your start-up capital.

84
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:35,960
What do you want to eat?

85
00:05:36,159 --> 00:05:37,710
It's my treat today.

86
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:39,380
Thank you, mom.

87
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:40,870
Thank you, Ma'am.

88
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:42,210
How can you still call me Ma'am?

89
00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:45,300
How about we talk about this next time?

90
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:49,070
Let's keep this together.

91
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:50,810
You take this one.

92
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:54,310
Waiter.

93
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:55,140
We're ready to order.

94
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:57,090
Come on.

95
00:05:57,510 --> 00:05:58,710
Try the cheese cake here.

96
00:05:58,880 --> 00:05:59,380
It's famous.

97
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:12,690
It's so delicious.

98
00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:13,350
Really?

99
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:19,780
What's wrong?

100
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:21,390
Is it too windy outside?

101
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:23,560
I'm fine.

102
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:25,740
I remember someone said

103
00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:27,220
if you sneeze,

104
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,170
it means someone misses you.

105
00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:30,150
Who else

106
00:06:30,170 --> 00:06:31,170
would miss you?

107
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:32,210
Xu Duo?

108
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,680
Could it be Xinyi?

109
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:37,050
I think it must be Xinyi who's thinking about me.

110
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:40,600
Look at you.

111
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:42,530
Naming your cat like that...

112
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:43,760
No wonder people suspect

113
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:44,860
that you have an illegitimate daughter.

114
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:48,490
I think Xinyi is a nice name.

115
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:50,909
If I have a daughter in the future,

116
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:52,540
I will give her this name.

117
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,230
It indeed sounds nice.

118
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:56,380
By the way,

119
00:06:57,390 --> 00:06:59,220
are there any other places you want to go to

120
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:00,250
on your gourmet map?

121
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:01,540
No.

122
00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:02,800
I'm full now.

123
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:04,110
And we've tried every place there.

124
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:07,100
Actually,

125
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:09,450
I secretly marked some letters on it.

126
00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:11,860
You can try to connect those letters

127
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:12,720
and see what it is.

128
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:18,420
Here.

129
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:23,590
There really is ABCD on it.

130
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:28,760
Let me see.

131
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:04,830
Dude,

132
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:06,230
you have to kneel on one knee to propose.

133
00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:06,970
Yeah.

134
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:08,260
Oh, right.

135
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:16,910
Shen Ying.

136
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:18,950
I want to thank you.

137
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:22,880
You taught me

138
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:27,130
what love should be like.

139
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:30,410
You also made me

140
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:32,880
get to know myself again.

141
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:35,200
These days,

142
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:37,350
I've been on cloud nine.

143
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:40,890
But I'm not satisfied with that.

144
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:46,590
I want that when I wake up every day,

145
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:50,000
your smile is the first thing

146
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:52,740
I see in the morning.

147
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:55,960
I want to see you smile at me

148
00:08:57,850 --> 00:08:59,070
every night before I sleep.

149
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:04,000
Xinyi needs a mother.

150
00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:10,480
I need a kind and beautiful wife.

151
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:12,210
You...

152
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:17,420
Are you willing to form a family

153
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:23,150
with us?

154
00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:37,070
Marry him! Marry him!

155
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:50,210
Shen Ying, I love you.

156
00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:04,530
At this moment,

157
00:10:05,330 --> 00:10:06,560
I was kind of in a trance.

158
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:09,580
I felt like I was back to a few months ago,

159
00:10:10,370 --> 00:10:13,760
when we got to know and love each other.

160
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:16,650
Time flies.

161
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,520
I hope from now on,

162
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:21,620
I can share the future with this man

163
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,240
and walk our life path

164
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:26,680
more slowly and longer,

165
00:10:28,590 --> 00:10:30,580
until we become an old couple.

166
00:10:32,210 --> 00:10:33,160
Hope we'll never separate.

167
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:36,020
Be careful.

168
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:55,900
[A month later]

169
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:55,560
Don't forget the time just because you're too busy.

170
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:56,780
This is a big deal.

171
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,520
I know.

172
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:05,110
You're a freelance chef now,

173
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,150
while I'm still a worker.

174
00:12:09,450 --> 00:12:10,090
It's just because

175
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,520
you and Miranda both resigned

176
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:13,670
and the new team hasn't adapted yet.

177
00:12:14,210 --> 00:12:15,430
I'm in charge of everything now.

178
00:12:15,450 --> 00:12:16,410
I'm really up to my neck.

179
00:12:18,410 --> 00:12:19,090
You're already there?

180
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:20,750
Wait a second.

181
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:21,420
I'll be right there.

182
00:12:23,010 --> 00:12:23,480
Bye.

183
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:34,350
Hello.

184
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:37,190
Are you curious

185
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:38,330
why I'm wearing a veil?

186
00:12:38,930 --> 00:12:39,770
Why?

187
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:40,990
Because

188
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,110
I'm going to get married with

189
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:46,450
that man standing in front of the Civil Affairs Bureau.

190
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:49,700
Although I was engaged once before,

191
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,900
I'm still nervous now.

192
00:12:53,610 --> 00:12:54,740
Anyway, that time doesn't count.

193
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:57,170
Now

194
00:12:57,590 --> 00:13:00,240
is the official start of the next journey of my life.

195
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,420
I'm already late.

196
00:13:02,730 --> 00:13:04,080
I have to go to my husband.

197
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,640
Hubby, I'm here.

198
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:08,180
You look so beautiful today.

199
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:09,960
What did you call me just now?

200
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:12,220
Nothing.

201
00:13:13,490 --> 00:13:14,210
Say it again.

202
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:17,580
We're late.

203
00:13:17,610 --> 00:13:18,380
Go get the marriage certificate.

204
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:18,970
No.

205
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:20,870
I want to hear you say it again.

206
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:23,750
Hubby.

207
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:25,340
What?

208
00:13:25,830 --> 00:13:26,800
Louder! I can't hear you!

209
00:13:27,510 --> 00:13:29,580
Hubby! Hubby! Hubby!

210
00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:31,340
Okay.

211
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:33,060
Let's get the marriage certificate.

212
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:34,310
From now on,

213
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:35,540
we'll be legally married.

214
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,400
We'll be husband-in-law and wife-in-law.

215
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:38,690
What nonsense!

216
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:40,710
Am I wrong?

217
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:42,330
You might as well call yourself an outlaw.

218
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:43,800
Fine.

219
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:45,290
Let's go, my Lady.

220
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:03,300
Is this certificate fake?

221
00:14:04,090 --> 00:14:06,510
It looks real.

222
00:14:06,530 --> 00:14:07,000
Yes.

223
00:14:10,410 --> 00:14:11,680
Alright, stop looking.

224
00:14:12,930 --> 00:14:13,720
Don't damage it.

225
00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:15,150
This is something you'll never use

226
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:16,150
for the rest of your life.

227
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:24,230
Do you really think nobody else has it?

228
00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:25,870
Do you have it?

229
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:30,670
Stop it.

230
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:33,820
Here.

231
00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:36,740
Good for you.

232
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:39,310
You've done something big secretively.

233
00:14:40,290 --> 00:14:41,540
You got married too early.

234
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:43,630
-Zhuang, is that fake? -Give it back.

235
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:44,390
It is fake.

236
00:14:44,410 --> 00:14:45,990
You get two copies for 20 Yuan at the street-side stalls.

237
00:14:50,610 --> 00:14:51,120
Fang,

238
00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:52,620
we are both single.

239
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:54,500
We don't need to make things difficult for each other, right?

240
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:54,930
All right.

241
00:14:54,930 --> 00:14:55,820
Let's eat first.

242
00:14:56,070 --> 00:14:57,110
Wait.

243
00:14:57,620 --> 00:14:58,500
There's one more person

244
00:14:58,840 --> 00:14:59,320
who will be here soon.

245
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:00,220
-Who is it? -Who is it?

246
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:01,720
I'm here.

247
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:04,460
Fang Siwei.

248
00:15:08,330 --> 00:15:10,150
I missed you so much today.

249
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:11,150
Now we've met.

250
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:12,840
Let's eat.

251
00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:14,620
I want to hug my Ying.

252
00:15:16,010 --> 00:15:16,800
Come on, Bai.

253
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:20,060
I want to hug Zhuang Yan, too.

254
00:15:20,850 --> 00:15:21,690
Long time no see.

255
00:15:22,530 --> 00:15:23,140
What is this?

256
00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:28,340
-Can't you even read Chinese now? -Don't you know?

257
00:15:31,450 --> 00:15:32,110
Fang,

258
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:34,240
when can I get married?

259
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,690
I can't stand it anymore.

260
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:46,150
You can get married

261
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:47,520
when you attain the legal age.

262
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:50,480
And then?

263
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:54,570
Then I’ll be your satellite.

264
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,270
She's grown up.

265
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:00,990
She's really grown up.

266
00:16:03,810 --> 00:16:04,210
Come on.

267
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:06,610
Wish all of us

268
00:16:06,950 --> 00:16:08,730
possess

269
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:13,650
long and solid happiness and love.

270
00:16:14,690 --> 00:16:16,010
We definitely will.

271
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:19,590
Here.

272
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:25,520
I love you, Mr. Zheng.

273
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:27,860
I love you too, Ms. Shen.

274
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:30,300
Life has a hundred tastes.

275
00:16:31,270 --> 00:16:32,590
The warmth in love

276
00:16:32,710 --> 00:16:33,600
is the most memorable.

277
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:38,070
We all want to be surrounded

278
00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:39,570
and walk on a path full of blossom.

279
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:43,250
There are so many people in this world.

280
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:45,480
I will do my best

281
00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:46,990
to love the people I love.

282
00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:49,260
I guess true delicacy

283
00:16:50,130 --> 00:16:51,710
is actually the taste of eternal love.

284
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:55,780
Honey.

285
00:16:55,810 --> 00:16:56,190
Slowly.

286
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:56,940
We're getting a room!

287
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:57,870
Keep your voice down.

288
00:16:58,310 --> 00:16:58,700
Here.

289
00:16:58,730 --> 00:16:59,220
Hello.

290
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:00,860
This is my wife.

291
00:17:01,130 --> 00:17:02,200
I want to have a room with my wife.

292
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:04,579
Let's get a room!

293
00:17:04,599 --> 00:17:05,109
Hello.

294
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:06,390
It would be 5,888 Yuan.

295
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:06,940
Please scan the QR code.

296
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:07,660
Say that again?

297
00:17:07,770 --> 00:17:08,810
5,888 Yuan.

298
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:10,579
It's too expensive.

299
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:13,140
Not expensive at all!

300
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:13,790
Forget it.

301
00:17:13,819 --> 00:17:14,530
No way!

302
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:15,550
Not tonight!

303
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:16,480
No.

304
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:17,710
Absolutely not.

305
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:20,750
Don't waste money.

306
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:23,730
Done.

307
00:17:23,890 --> 00:17:24,410
Hold on.

308
00:17:27,869 --> 00:17:28,190
Hello.

309
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:29,210
This is your room card.

310
00:17:29,410 --> 00:17:31,490
We've got a room!

311
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:29,360
Good morning, family.

312
00:18:51,810 --> 00:18:52,450
Morning.

313
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:54,470
You're up.

314
00:18:54,990 --> 00:18:55,550
Did you sleep well?

315
00:18:57,190 --> 00:18:57,930
What are you making?

316
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,420
I'm making you breakfast.

317
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:13,550
Xinyi.

318
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,010
Come on, baby.

319
00:19:16,110 --> 00:19:16,970
Come, let Mommy hug you.

320
00:19:17,370 --> 00:19:19,210
You're here to make breakfast with Daddy, too?

321
00:19:19,770 --> 00:19:20,400
Be good.

322
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:22,340
Let's watch dad make breakfast together, okay?

323
00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:31,670
Xinyi.

324
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:36,540
Xinyi.

325
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:38,060
Wait for us here.

326
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:39,950
We'll cook delicious food for you.

327
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:45,110
Let me check the results.

328
00:19:47,370 --> 00:19:47,850
Is it crispy?

329
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:50,690
Have a taste.

330
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:57,300
I suddenly feel

331
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,140
one sandwich is not enough for us.

332
00:20:02,730 --> 00:20:04,130
Let me make you a big sandwich.

333
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:08,250
You're a sandwich now.

334
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,290
I want to eat it, okay?

335
00:20:19,210 --> 00:20:20,950
Okay, it's a wrap!

336
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:23,900
Show the audience what's behind your bangs,

337
00:20:23,930 --> 00:20:24,460
okay?

338
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:33,280
-Let's lift Zheng Dao's wig. -Come on.

339
00:20:33,310 --> 00:20:34,280
Let's change our bangs.

340
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:44,350
-Bye. -Bye.
