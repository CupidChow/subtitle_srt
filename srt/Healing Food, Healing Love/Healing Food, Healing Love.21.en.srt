Where are Fang and Zheng Dao?

They are not here.

It's raining outside.

The boss asked me to tidy up

14
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:14,910

Okay, I'll be right there.

29
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:07,280
Someone saw Zheng Dao go to hospital.

30
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:10,460
What happened?

31
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:12,300
It was said that he fainted near Restaurant Si

32
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:14,350
and was taken to the hospital by a woman.

33
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:15,660
His condition is unknown now.

34
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:17,500
I don't know if he can participate in the competition tomorrow.

35
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:19,360
If anything happens to Zheng Dao,

36
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,350
report it to me anytime.

37
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:21,600
Yes, sir.

38
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:34,640
Nurse! Nurse!

39
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:35,579

Go.

42
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:44,570
Han Feizi. How's Zheng Dao?

43
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:48,460
The doctor is still examining him.

44
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:49,720
It might not be serious.

45
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:51,480
When I found him,

46
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:53,370
I saw him from afar that he got injured from the falling.

47
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:54,670
Falling?

48
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:55,790
Could it be...

49
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:56,440
Stress response.

50
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:58,870
Plus, he was too stressful for the issue.

51
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:00,650
Yes.

52
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:03,660
It may be related to what happened on Weibo today.

53

55
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:09,260
Stop mentioning them.

56
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:16,220
I'm sorry.

57
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:18,310
Have a seat, Shen Ying.

58
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:20,060
It's useless to worry.

59
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:20,990
Take a rest.

60
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:35,540
You're all wet.

61
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:36,510
Don't catch a cold.

62
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:37,070
Take care of yourself.

63
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:39,190
Thank you.

64
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:49,810
Although

65
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:51,250
you still have to apologize

66
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:53,210
to Zheng Dao in person.

67
00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:00,220
What should I do

68
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:01,650
when your ex and present girlfriends are both here?

69
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:02,620
Zheng Dao.

70
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:03,980
This is your job.

71
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:05,660
Wake up now, Zheng Dao.

72
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:09,370
I need to use the bathroom.

73
00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:10,330
Excuse me.

74
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:15,850
You went to see him today?

75
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:20,540
I found someone shaping public opinion.

76
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:21,920
I was worried.

77
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:23,250
So I went to see him.

78
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:24,850
Do you still love him?

79
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:31,680
Shen Ying. Shen Ying.

80
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:35,240
Shen Ying.

81
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:40,930
Have you seen the video about you?

82
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,200
The video about me?

83
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:44,250
You're a trending topic now.

84
00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:50,780
Shen Ying.

85
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:52,180
Are you with Zheng Dao

86
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,100
because of your career?

87
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:55,210
Yes.

88
00:05:55,950 --> 00:05:56,880
Zheng Dao is the reason

89
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,990
that my career is complete.

90
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:01,100
It has been taken out of context.

91
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:02,490
I stay with him

92
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:03,700
not because

93
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:04,580
Zheng Dao is good for my career

94
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:06,600
but because I love him.

95
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:08,380
I told you someone is leading the public opinion.

96
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:11,130
You have to explain this to Zheng Dao.

97
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:15,160
Coincidentally,

98
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:18,050
both of us have to make an explanation to Zheng Dao.

99
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:21,100
Am I part of the reason

100
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:23,180
why Zheng Dao fainted?

101
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:26,200
Who is trying to frame me?

102
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:34,590
The patient's condition is not serious.

103
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,750
It's a dizziness caused by insufficient blood flow to the brain.

104
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:38,740
He might be in shock for something.

105
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:39,550
-Well. -Doctor.

106
00:06:40,030 --> 00:06:41,830
Zheng Dao had the same situation before.

107
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:42,860
That's the case.

108
00:06:43,159 --> 00:06:44,280
He was exhausted

109
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:45,540
and didn't rest well.

110
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,560
So he's been in a coma until now.

111
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:49,060
After the patient comes to himself,

112
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:50,870
we can give him a full examination.

113
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:51,500
Well...

114
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:53,270
The family follow me and help check him in, please.

115
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:54,110
Okay.

116
00:06:55,390 --> 00:06:56,070
Go back first.

117
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:57,590
Thank you for today.

118
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,200
Now,

119
00:07:00,010 --> 00:07:00,920
I'm here.

120
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:02,300
Got it.

121
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:03,560
I'll get going.

122
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:07,050
Thank you, doctor.

123
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:08,190
This way.

124
00:07:25,150 --> 00:07:25,600
Zheng Dao.

125
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:28,090
I'm sure he passed out

126
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:29,210
due to a great shock.

127
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:32,220
Xu Duo.

128
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:33,230
Can you tell me

129
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:34,890
what happened two years ago?

130
00:07:45,810 --> 00:07:46,659
Two years ago,

131
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:48,820
Zheng Do engaged in the Bocuse d'Or.

132
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:51,300
Do you know what the Bocuse d'Or is?

133
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:56,150
It's... the best chef award in Europe.

134
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,400
At that time,

135
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:00,050
his grades were cancelled

136
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:02,410
and got scolded for plagiarism.

137
00:08:03,410 --> 00:08:05,030
So after he returned to China...

138
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:12,190
Because he was painful for his previous relationship and career,

139
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:15,140
Zheng Dao hit the bottle almost every day

140
00:08:16,170 --> 00:08:17,460
after he came back.

141
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:32,340
Look at you.

142
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:33,669
You've been back for two weeks.

143
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,190
But you drink almost every day.

144
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:39,610
Even if your career is suspended,

145
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:40,760
Even if you lost your girlfriend,

146
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,390
it's not the end of the world, isn't it?

147
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:46,490
What's the point?

148
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:52,300
For a human,

149
00:08:53,290 --> 00:08:55,300
once his mental power he relies on

150
00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:57,020
is smashed,

151
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,600
he'll get sick easily.

152
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:00,560
Or,

153
00:09:01,010 --> 00:09:02,840
he'll get post-traumatic stress disorder.

154
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:05,580
So since then,

155
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:07,960
he couldn't cook any longer.

156
00:09:32,570 --> 00:09:33,010
Take them.

157
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:34,930
Are you sure you don't want them anymore?

158
00:09:36,170 --> 00:09:36,610
No.

159
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:38,450
Fine.

160
00:09:58,300 --> 00:09:58,900
Then why didn't he

161
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:00,550
make the plagiarism clear?

162
00:10:00,730 --> 00:10:02,910
He left without saying anything.

163
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:04,420
I think

164
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,670
it’s because of the relationship with Han Feizi.

165
00:10:08,290 --> 00:10:09,230
After he came back,

166
00:10:09,890 --> 00:10:11,200
he didn't trust anyone easily

167
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:12,890
or enter the kitchen any longer.

168
00:10:13,770 --> 00:10:15,250
Thus, he became

169
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:17,520
a trenchant gourmet on the Internet.

170
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:20,420
I didn't expect him to have suffered so much.

171
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:21,950
Yeah.

172
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:23,260
Look at him.

173
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,330
He looks like a cold person.

174
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:25,920
Actually,

175
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:27,280
he values relationships the most.

176
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:32,260
Why don't you go back first?

177
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:33,640
It's okay.

178
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:37,900
I hope he can see me at the first sight

179
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:41,100
when he wakes up.

180
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:43,920
Alright.

181
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:07,780
Hello, Shen Ying.

182
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:09,140
Hello, Miranda. What's up?

183
00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:10,400
Come to my office now.

184
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:11,500
I've got some urgent business.

185
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:12,530
What is it?

186
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:13,430
I'm in the hospital.

187
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:15,140
Why did you go to the hospital?

188
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:16,190
Are you sick?

189
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:17,030
No.

190
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:17,780
It's Zheng Dao.

191
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,130
He suddenly feels unwell.

192
00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:22,490
Is it serious?

193
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:23,840
He is fine now.

194
00:11:23,970 --> 00:11:24,410
Don't worry.

195
00:11:25,690 --> 00:11:26,140
Okay.

196
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:28,410
Get back soon

197
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:29,310
after you deal with that.

198
00:11:29,610 --> 00:11:30,030
Note that.

199
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,060
I need to go back to the office.

200
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:38,140
Keep an eye on Zheng Dao for me.

201
00:11:38,450 --> 00:11:38,880
Okay.

202
00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:40,170
I'll watch him for you.

203
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:01,990
Shen Ying.

204
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:04,130
How long have you been in the company?

205
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,070
From the internship,

206
00:12:08,850 --> 00:12:09,560
it's been six or seven years.

207
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:12,970
I plan to

208
00:12:14,170 --> 00:12:16,310
apply for a position as deputy editor to the headquarters.

209
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:18,070
You're the only candidate.

210
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:20,180
The condition is...

211
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:22,060
What is it?

212
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:25,100
In the evaluation tomorrow,

213
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:27,440
grade Si the lowest score.

214
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,050
Miranda,

215
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:35,480
-as for it... -I know.

216
00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:37,670
I understand your difficulties.

217
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:38,980
Of course,

218
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:40,710
you have the right to choose.

219
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,600
It depends on you.

220
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:45,030
Don't rush to answer me now.

221
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:46,180
Think about it.

222
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:48,690
Weigh the pros and cons.

223
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:18,360
You're awake.

224
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:21,160
Who sent me here?

225
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,420
Your ex-girlfriend, Han Feizi.

226
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:24,230
Really?

227
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:28,660
How are you?

228
00:13:30,530 --> 00:13:32,140
That's it?

229
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:34,080
In order to send you,

230
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:35,270
she was drenched yesterday.

231
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:37,340
Got it.

232
00:13:42,130 --> 00:13:42,800
It's nine o'clock.

233
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:44,500
I have to go to the competition and help my mate.

234
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:45,760
Help me do the follow-up.

235
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:46,740
Alright.

236
00:13:46,770 --> 00:13:47,610
Got it.

237
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:50,400
No need to think about it, Miranda.

238
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:52,710
There are still many opportunities in the future.

239
00:13:53,770 --> 00:13:55,490
I just want to grade with a clear conscience.

240
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:19,800
Yoyo.

241
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:21,140
To the right for a bit.

242
00:14:22,590 --> 00:14:22,980
Okay.

243
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:24,710
Zheng Dao.

244
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:26,420
Did you sleep well last night?

245
00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:28,630
Not bad.

246
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:29,580
Right,

247
00:14:29,810 --> 00:14:30,250
have a look.

248
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:43,500
Mackerel, morels, small crab roe.

249
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:44,480
Three dishes?

250
00:14:49,810 --> 00:14:50,350
Mackerel?

251
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:55,870
Mackerel.

252
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:00,900
Zheng Dao.

253
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:05,560
Are you feeling better?

254
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:11,840
Miss Han?

255
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,280
I didn't expect that I was famous here.

256
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:16,900
Nice to meet you, Mr. Fang.

257
00:15:20,110 --> 00:15:20,640
Thank you.

258
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:25,900
You're welcome.

259
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:29,890
Fang.

260
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:32,990
Fang!

261
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:36,050
Shen Ying.

262
00:15:36,990 --> 00:15:37,540
You're here.

263
00:15:38,810 --> 00:15:40,090
You're early.

264
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:45,100
After the intense selection last week,

265
00:15:45,370 --> 00:15:46,520
20 restaurants

266
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:47,750
have entered the final.

267
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:48,490
Thank you.

268
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:50,990
The production process of the final will be on a live stream.

269
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:53,010
In this year's selection,

270
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:54,380
We invited more judges

271
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:56,100
and have sorted out the selection system

272
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:59,300
to bring you a more reasonable and systematic one.

273
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:00,380
During the final selection,

274
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:02,790
besides the production, tasting,

275
00:16:02,830 --> 00:16:03,780
and scoring,

276
00:16:04,210 --> 00:16:05,780
we will also invite anonymous judges

277
00:16:05,870 --> 00:16:07,710
to visit every finalist

278
00:16:07,790 --> 00:16:09,040
incognito.

279
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:12,210
Based on the ingredients, cooking, taste, hygiene...

280
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,920
-I am prepared. -environment, service, and other items,

281
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:15,710
we'll grade finalists item by item.

282
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,140
Then we will add up the scores from two parts

283
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:18,930
and the Municipal Notary Public will notarize them.

284
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:20,450
We will count the scores independently

285
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,760
and get the final result.

286
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:22,940
Every restaurant...

287
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:23,500
Mr. Yu.

288
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:26,070
This is the additional topic for Si.

289
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:27,560
...to complete the production.

290
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:28,810
Next,

291
00:16:28,830 --> 00:16:30,030
here comes our competition.

292
00:16:30,610 --> 00:16:31,050
Now,

293
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:34,000
let's connect Restaurant Si and the kitchen.

294
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,230
Even if they

295
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:38,620
prepared everything according to the question bank,

296
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:41,220
they would never expect

297
00:16:41,590 --> 00:16:42,990
that I would change the topic,

298
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:44,950
catching them off guard.

299
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:46,700
Mr. Yu is wise.

300
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:55,460
The ingredient is good.

301
00:16:56,810 --> 00:16:58,540
The food in the competition will be fine for sure.

302
00:16:58,890 --> 00:16:59,900
What are you going to do?

303
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:01,540
Time is running out.

304
00:17:01,650 --> 00:17:02,730
I haven't practiced a new method.

305
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,280
I want to go back to the origin.

306
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:06,740
I will say frying, the simplest way.

307
00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:08,940
Great.

308
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:09,740
Just do it.

309
00:17:17,810 --> 00:17:18,450
As we can see,

310
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:20,319
the way Si dealt with the mackerel

311
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:22,220
should be frying.

312
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:56,500
What's going on?

313
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,040
What happened?

314
00:17:58,210 --> 00:17:58,780
I don't know.

315
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:02,100
Is he sick?

316
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:06,820
Is it serious?

317
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:08,400
Yu Sicheng,

318
00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:12,020
go to the kitchen to shoot Zheng Dao.

319
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:12,900
Tell me if anything happens.

320
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:23,320
Are you okay?

321
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:25,680
I'm fine. Go on.

322
00:18:39,690 --> 00:18:40,640
I just observed.

323
00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:42,840
Everyone enjoys different quantities of fat and taste

324
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:43,790
when it comes to mackerel.

325
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:45,460
I got a preliminary assessment

326
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:46,480
according to their figures.

327
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:47,750
Don't make a mistake

328
00:18:47,810 --> 00:18:48,650
when we serve them.

329
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,080
Okay. I get it.

330
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:50,840
I'll start now.

331
00:18:50,870 --> 00:18:51,180
Okay.

332
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:46,820
Done.

333
00:19:49,610 --> 00:19:50,050
Let's go.

334
00:19:58,790 --> 00:19:59,550
Fried Mackerel.

335
00:19:59,910 --> 00:20:00,350
Please enjoy.

336
00:20:01,610 --> 00:20:02,380
Fried Mackerel.

337
00:20:14,010 --> 00:20:15,760
Now, expert judges, please have a taste.

338
00:20:18,890 --> 00:20:20,890
Without any preparation

339
00:20:21,030 --> 00:20:22,370
and the time to mull over the heat,

340
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:26,810
they must have been in disarray.

341
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:28,660
Yes, Mr. Yu.

342
00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:31,390
When we took part in the Golden Fritillaria Competition,

343
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,600
it took us at least half a month

344
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:35,280
to try and improve every new dish.

345
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,230
There's no detail without honing.

346
00:20:38,970 --> 00:20:40,780
With such a shoddy dish they threw together,

347
00:20:41,390 --> 00:20:43,610
I’ll see how they dare say

348
00:20:44,090 --> 00:20:46,500
what they made is a delicacy.

349
00:20:47,510 --> 00:20:48,860
Even if they cook well,

350
00:20:49,310 --> 00:20:50,160
we still have a backup plan.

351
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:52,590
Please grade the dish

352
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:54,090
after you taste it.

353
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:00,090
How is it going?

354
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:00,800
Look.

355
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:01,670
What’s wrong with you two?

356
00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:03,980
Why do you look like

357
00:22:04,210 --> 00:22:06,260
you have changed your mind?

358
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:08,930
You're not that kind of person.

359
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:12,040
Or had you never changed your mind?

360
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:14,990
You know nothing.

361
00:22:15,010 --> 00:22:15,570
Don't talk nonsense.

362
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:24,990
For most people,

363
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:27,200
Zheng Dao is not easy to get along with.

364
00:22:27,710 --> 00:22:28,270
What do you think?

365
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:33,340
But it's different for you indeed.

366
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:39,840
Not right.

367
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:42,920
Why should I be controlled by this woman

368
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:44,210
on my feelings for Zheng Dao?

369
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:46,030
Shen Ying.

370
00:22:47,030 --> 00:22:47,800
You can't lose.

371
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:53,510
I'll announce the result now.

372
00:23:02,650 --> 00:23:04,010
Ms. Han, 9.6.

373
00:23:05,610 --> 00:23:06,930
Han Feizi.

374
00:23:09,090 --> 00:23:10,500
Interesting.

375
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:12,890
Ms. Shen, 9.5.

376
00:23:16,710 --> 00:23:18,190
Mr. Liu, 5.3.

377
00:23:21,810 --> 00:23:23,210
Professor Chen, 5.4.

378
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:30,010
Ms. Ma, 5.6.
