52
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:44,210
To be honest, do you have a crush on her?

53
00:02:44,829 --> 00:02:45,590


54
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:45,780
Of course not.

56
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:46,910
She's still young.

58
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,560
I'm not buying it.

00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:51,430


60
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:51,570
I'm just being considerate.

61
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:52,670


62
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:52,810
There are so many subordinates.

63
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:54,190


64
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:54,340
Why don't you care about others?

65
00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:00,550


66
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:00,700
Why are you so talkative today?

67
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:05,830


68
00:03:05,570 --> 00:03:06,010

Are you in trouble?

71

72
00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:08,970
There is no bird's nest.

73
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:13,420


74
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:13,600
I'd like to make some coconut almond sago instead.

75
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:15,430


76
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:15,580
But the preparetion of sago

77
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:16,790


78
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:16,980
tests the skills of a chef.

79
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:18,550


80
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:18,700
You can't do it.

81
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:19,300


82
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:19,450
Cheif Dong can't do it, either.

83
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:21,470


84
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:21,610
You can do it. You're a chef.

85
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:24,910


86
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:25,060
You know I can't cook.

87
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:27,300


88
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:27,500
It's not very difficult to make.

89
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:28,980


90
00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:29,130
And It's been so long since that happend.

91
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:30,630


92
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:30,780
It's time to get over it.

93
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:34,630


94
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:34,780
Come on.

104
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:37,050
I have nothing to do with Mr. Zheng Dao.

105
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:46,500


106
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,760
We were together before,

107

108
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:50,540
but we've already separated.

109
00:04:53,909 --> 00:04:54,390


110
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:54,560
I'm sorry.

Are you okay?

00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:34,420


114
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:34,600
Ms. Shen.

116
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:36,860
Our chef made this

117
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:37,830


118
00:05:36,909 --> 00:05:38,030

122
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,590
Why does it taste a little salty?

123
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:52,870


124
00:05:50,690 --> 00:05:52,909
But the sweetness is just right.

126
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:55,020
It isn't served cold as usual.

127
00:05:55,909 --> 00:05:56,990


128
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,070

00:05:58,030 --> 00:05:58,640
and warm.

131

132
00:06:00,450 --> 00:06:02,060
It's my first time to dispel the effects of alcohol by a dessert.

134

I will leave you to it.

OK.

151

152
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:23,790
Where can I find a host and a photographer?

153
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:27,790


154
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:27,880
I can't get married.

155
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:31,270


156
00:06:30,450 --> 00:06:31,160
Bastard!

What are you doing?

160
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:49,620
Give this to her

later.

163
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:52,230


164
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:52,370
And

165

168
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:00,460
Why don't you give them to her yourself?

169
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:02,630


170
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:02,800
Because I'm a mysterious chef.

171
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:05,830


172
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:05,980
A mysterious chef?

Leave it to me.

Bye.

196
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:19,750


197
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:19,830
How is it?

198
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:24,790


199
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:24,870
I sent her away for you.

200
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:26,310


201
00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:26,370
I think

202
00:08:26,470 --> 00:08:27,550


203
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:27,700
she is in a good mood after the meal.

204
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:29,110


205
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:29,250
Did you add some magic cure

206
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:30,430


207
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:30,580

00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:33,030


209
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:33,150
But I added the wrong ingredients in the meal this time.

210
00:08:33,309 --> 00:08:34,390


211
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:34,400
She ate all of it.

212
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:40,030


213
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:40,140
Dr Xu is here.

214
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:46,630


215
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:46,830
By the way,

216
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:47,950


217
00:08:47,290 --> 00:08:48,100
are you hungry?

218
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:49,260


219
00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:49,410
Do you want some snacks?

220
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,790


221
00:08:50,650 --> 00:08:52,940
You can't cook, can you?

222
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:53,710


223
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:53,870
What if I can?

224
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:11,870


225
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:12,020
Cats can't eat chips.

226
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:12,390


227
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:12,540
Stop feeding them.

228
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:24,790


229
00:09:23,450 --> 00:09:24,890
This kind of junk food is quite tasty.

230
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:31,500


231
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:31,650
What's going on?

232
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:32,740


233
00:09:32,050 --> 00:09:32,890
Ying,

234
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:34,270


235
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:34,390
You are not yourself.

236
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:37,030


237
00:09:36,090 --> 00:09:37,170
You are really not yourself.

238
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:37,780


239
00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:37,960
What happened?

240
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:40,870


241
00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:41,020
Did you meet some handsome guy?

242
00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:42,990


243
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:43,000
There's no handsome guy.

244
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:46,190


245
00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:46,370
She is not herself.

246
00:09:57,830 --> 00:09:59,350


247
00:09:58,030 --> 00:09:59,550
If the chef was handsome, it would be nice.

248
00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:01,430


249
00:09:59,650 --> 00:10:01,580
It seems that

250
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:02,670


251
00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:02,760
he is not a great guy.

252
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:04,190


253
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,340
What a pity!

254
00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:06,990


255
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:07,170
I didn't even see him.

256
00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:10,430


257
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:10,540
I have to blame you.

258
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:12,390


259
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,420
Online dating is risky.

260
00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:13,710


261
00:10:12,650 --> 00:10:13,860
You should be careful.

262
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:15,870


263
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:16,010
Let me tell you the truth,

264
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:16,260


265
00:10:16,010 --> 00:10:16,440

267
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:18,260
After Director Zheng helped me,

268
00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:19,390


269
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:19,540
he arranged me to go to the Si Restaurant.

270
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:21,390


271
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:21,540
I

272
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:23,390

was completely cured by the food there.

274
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:24,550


275
00:10:23,810 --> 00:10:24,700
So,

my manuscript will be popular.

282
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:31,830


283
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:31,970
My bonus will be doubled.

284
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:33,790


285
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:33,880
Why do you only care about money?

286
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:34,790


287
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:34,960
How vulgar!

288
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:36,270


289
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:36,460
I want to break up with her.

290
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:39,550


291
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:39,700
You think I am vulgar?

292
00:10:40,830 --> 00:10:41,630


293
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:41,780
Then don't eat the fried chicken.

294
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:42,510


295
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:42,660
This is mine.

299
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:45,300
Just kidding.

301
00:10:46,290 --> 00:10:47,530
Don't just eat, okay?

302
00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:48,950


303
00:10:47,570 --> 00:10:49,140
Come on, have some wine.

304

The older we get,

313
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:56,740
the less we can control.

315
00:10:57,380 --> 00:10:58,980
But every time I receive a favor,

325
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:08,130

426
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:54,710
Mentor, you go first.

428
00:12:55,730 --> 00:12:57,320
I'm not your mentor.

430
00:13:03,890 --> 00:13:04,330
Mentor.

You are coming to my office,

434
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:07,220
not on a death row.

435
00:13:07,710 --> 00:13:08,670


436
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:08,820
Do you have to be so modest?

437
00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:09,510


438
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:09,660
After you, Mentor.

I...

440
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:11,870


441
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:12,020
Lin Man.

442

443
00:13:12,130 --> 00:13:13,260
I told you

444
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:13,870


445
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:14,010
I don't need it now.

446
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:14,260


447
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:15,880
-I don;t need it. - As for the new equipment list you requested--

448
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:15,750


449
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:17,510


450
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:17,660
I've signed it.

451
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:21,150


452
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:21,310
Really?

453
00:13:31,070 --> 00:13:32,670


454
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:32,820
Yu is very interested in photography.

455
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:33,830


456
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:33,970
Take good care of him.

457
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:36,590


458
00:13:35,570 --> 00:13:36,770
Mentor, I can do it.

459
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:39,350


460
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:39,500
Yu.

461
00:13:40,310 --> 00:13:41,510


462
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:41,710
Follow her step.

463
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:42,030


464
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:42,170
OK.

465
00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:42,870


466
00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:43,040
Don't worry, sister.

467
00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:47,830


468
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:47,930
Thank you, Chief Editor.

469

474
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:56,190
Mentor.

475
00:13:57,340 --> 00:13:58,870


476
00:13:57,490 --> 00:13:58,920
Mentor, let me buy you some drinks.

477
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:07,510


478
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:07,550
What's your name again?

479
00:14:10,830 --> 00:14:11,710


480
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:11,750
My name is Yu Sicheng.

481
00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:17,750


482
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:17,920
Hello, Yu Sicheng.

483
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:18,870


484
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:19,020
Stay away from me.

485
00:14:27,510 --> 00:14:28,350


486
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:28,480
Come on, take a look inside.

487
00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:37,310


488
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,460
The decoration of the restaurant is so exquisite.

489
00:14:37,470 --> 00:14:39,030


490
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:39,170
Mr. Jin must have

491
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:40,110


492
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:40,260
done a lot of research on this.

493
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:40,670


494
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:40,840
No.

495
00:14:41,310 --> 00:14:42,670


496
00:14:41,470 --> 00:14:42,800
I just spent some money

497
00:14:42,830 --> 00:14:44,990


498
00:14:43,010 --> 00:14:45,170
on getting the designer to do a good job

499
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:46,710


500
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:46,790
As for the decoration,

501
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:47,990


502
00:14:47,150 --> 00:14:48,120
I chose the best materials,

503
00:14:48,190 --> 00:14:49,550


504
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:49,730
just as the same as I did for our meal.

505
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:52,550


506
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:52,730
I've long heard that Buerhui is a century-old restaurant.

507
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:54,350


508
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:54,490
It's an absolute quality guarantee.

509
00:14:55,430 --> 00:14:56,710


510
00:14:55,610 --> 00:14:56,820
I'm flattered, Editor Shen.

511
00:14:57,660 --> 00:14:58,150


512
00:14:57,810 --> 00:14:58,290
Mr Jin,

513
00:14:58,590 --> 00:15:00,430


514
00:14:58,710 --> 00:15:00,550
What is the production process of your steamed buns?

515
00:15:01,590 --> 00:15:03,390


516
00:15:01,810 --> 00:15:03,540
We chose the best ingredients

517
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:04,780


518
00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:04,900
and made them with our heart.

519
00:15:06,190 --> 00:15:08,110


520
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:08,190
I mean, the production process.

521
00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:09,790


522
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:09,940
For example, the time of dough,

523
00:15:10,190 --> 00:15:10,990


524
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:11,140
steam temperature

525
00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:12,390


526
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:12,530
and time.

527
00:15:13,310 --> 00:15:14,030


528
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:14,180
Well,

529
00:15:14,950 --> 00:15:16,550


530
00:15:15,090 --> 00:15:16,700
we follow the standards of the industry.

531
00:15:18,430 --> 00:15:19,990


532
00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:20,150
The standards of the industry are unified.

533
00:15:20,350 --> 00:15:22,020


534
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:22,170
What is the unique part of Buerhui?

535
00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:28,830


536
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:28,970
Buerhui is the standard of steamed buns.

537
00:15:31,150 --> 00:15:32,630


538
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:32,810
You're so kind.

539
00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:34,390


540
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:34,540
Have a seat.

541
00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:41,780


542
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:41,930
Mr. Jin

543
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:43,470


544
00:15:42,050 --> 00:15:43,650
may have not cooked in the kitchen for a long time,

545
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:44,750


546
00:15:43,990 --> 00:15:44,940
so you don't know the process.

547
00:15:45,990 --> 00:15:47,470


548
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:47,620
But you should know

549
00:15:47,470 --> 00:15:48,190


550
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:48,340
the story of Buerhui, do you?

551
00:15:49,310 --> 00:15:49,990


552
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:50,140
I inherited the restaurant

553
00:15:50,270 --> 00:15:51,550


554
00:15:50,410 --> 00:15:51,700
from my grandpa.

555
00:15:52,630 --> 00:15:53,510


556
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:53,660
I really don't know

557
00:15:54,590 --> 00:15:55,590


558
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:55,740
about the story of the old generation.

559
00:15:56,070 --> 00:15:56,470


560
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:56,620
Really?

561
00:15:57,590 --> 00:15:57,990


562
00:15:57,730 --> 00:15:58,080
Excuse me.

563
00:15:58,430 --> 00:15:59,790


564
00:15:58,570 --> 00:16:00,030
This is our steamed buns with deer antler and sea cucumber,

565
00:16:00,030 --> 00:16:00,830


566
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:00,980
which cost 188 yuan each.

567
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:02,310


568
00:16:01,570 --> 00:16:02,450
This is steamed buns with angus steak.

569
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:03,510


570
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:03,670
288 yuan each.

571
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:06,950


572
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:07,100
Please have a try.

573
00:16:17,230 --> 00:16:18,230


574
00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:18,260
It's delicious.

575
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:20,390


576
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:20,540
I didn't expect the traditional steamed buns

577
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:21,430


578
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:21,580
could have improved so much.

579
00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:23,710


580
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:23,910
There must be some improvements.

581
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:25,550


582
00:16:24,170 --> 00:16:25,690
If I just made traditional steamed buns,

583
00:16:26,190 --> 00:16:27,750


584
00:16:26,330 --> 00:16:27,900
I would not be able to built the reatsurant

585
00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:29,310


586
00:16:28,090 --> 00:16:29,380
to the scale it is now.

587
00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:30,790


588
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:30,930
Nowadays, people

589
00:16:30,830 --> 00:16:32,470


590
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,570
like new things.

591
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:34,190


592
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:34,240
They like new and expensive things.

593
00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:36,350


594
00:16:34,530 --> 00:16:36,400
So, it's necessary to make these improvements.

595
00:16:41,190 --> 00:16:42,110


596
00:16:41,370 --> 00:16:42,290
Anything wrong, Director Zheng?

597
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:43,830


598
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:43,870
You don't like it?

599
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:44,990


600
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:45,150
Yes, I do.

601
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:47,190


602
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:47,330
Our director always frown

603
00:16:47,190 --> 00:16:48,230


604
00:16:47,330 --> 00:16:48,370
when he is thinking.

605
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:48,910


606
00:16:48,370 --> 00:16:49,060
Yeah.

607
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:51,430


608
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:51,590
I think he is thinking about

609
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:53,750


610
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:53,900
how to effectively promote this new taste of

611
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:55,070


612
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:55,220
combination of Chinese and Western, right?

613
00:16:57,150 --> 00:16:58,230


614
00:16:57,270 --> 00:16:58,350
Boss, the chef is looking for you.

615
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:00,230


616
00:16:59,890 --> 00:17:00,380
Excuse me.

617
00:17:00,590 --> 00:17:01,750


618
00:17:00,810 --> 00:17:01,970
Excuse me.

619
00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:02,830


620
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:02,980
Go ahead.

621
00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:07,589


622
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:07,730
You...

623
00:17:07,630 --> 00:17:08,150


624
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:08,300
Wait for me.

625
00:17:14,710 --> 00:17:15,270


626
00:17:14,810 --> 00:17:15,380
Grandma.

627
00:17:15,670 --> 00:17:17,390


628
00:17:15,819 --> 00:17:17,540
You've been sitting here for a long time.

629
00:17:17,550 --> 00:17:18,630


630
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:18,720
Why don't you eat?

631
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:20,310


632
00:17:18,849 --> 00:17:20,230
It doesn't taste right.

633
00:17:21,069 --> 00:17:23,869


634
00:17:21,170 --> 00:17:23,890
Do you think the cook has changed

635
00:17:24,869 --> 00:17:26,020


636
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:26,170
or the raw materials?

637
00:17:26,950 --> 00:17:28,590


638
00:17:27,099 --> 00:17:28,730
Things change.

639
00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:31,910


640
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:32,030
People change faster than things.

641
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:39,670


642
00:17:38,370 --> 00:17:39,820
Sorry to keep you waiting.

643
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:41,630


644
00:17:41,370 --> 00:17:41,770
It's okay.

645
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:42,910


646
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:43,010
The reason I found Essen

647
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:45,230


648
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:45,330
because I want to

649
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:46,910


650
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:47,050
more popular

651
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:48,990


652
00:17:47,330 --> 00:17:49,090
and increase the sales.

653
00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:51,270


654
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:51,330
The conservative plan

655
00:17:51,550 --> 00:17:53,110


656
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:53,260
to reach the previous 150%.

657
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:54,910


658
00:17:53,690 --> 00:17:55,060
Of course.

659
00:17:55,590 --> 00:17:57,430


660
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:57,580
Miss Jin is so generous.

661
00:17:57,740 --> 00:17:58,750


662
00:17:57,890 --> 00:17:58,900
Don’t worry.

663
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:00,190


664
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:00,340
Leave the article to me.

665
00:18:00,310 --> 00:18:00,910


666
00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:01,060
Okay.

667
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:02,910


668
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:02,900
Thank you.

669
00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:04,630


670
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:04,780
That's all for today.

671
00:18:05,390 --> 00:18:05,830


672
00:18:05,530 --> 00:18:05,980
Goodbye.

673
00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:07,220


674
00:18:06,970 --> 00:18:07,370
Let's go.

675
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:09,510


676
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:09,620
We're leaving.

677
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:11,070


678
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:11,170
See you off.

679
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:16,550


680
00:18:15,570 --> 00:18:16,700
I’ll tell Lin Man

681
00:18:16,550 --> 00:18:18,110


682
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:18,260
this plan is not suitable for

683
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:19,710


684
00:18:18,930 --> 00:18:19,860
A century-old store like this

685
00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:20,910


686
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:21,050
is not bad

687
00:18:20,910 --> 00:18:21,950


688
00:18:21,050 --> 00:18:22,090
I don't think it's bad.

689
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:23,310


690
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:23,460
The innovation is real.

691
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:24,430


692
00:18:23,610 --> 00:18:24,580
So is the tradition.

693
00:18:24,710 --> 00:18:26,030


694
00:18:24,850 --> 00:18:26,180
The flow line is just a tool

695
00:18:26,030 --> 00:18:27,350


696
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:27,500
to improve efficiency.

697
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:30,340


698
00:18:28,810 --> 00:18:30,490
You disregard the nature to improve efficiency.

699
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:31,910


700
00:18:30,890 --> 00:18:32,060
Is this how you write articles?

701
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:33,950


702
00:18:33,410 --> 00:18:34,090
Director Zheng.

703
00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:35,950


704
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:36,100
Not everyone is as picky as you.

705
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:37,590


706
00:18:36,370 --> 00:18:37,740
If everyone is so picky,

707
00:18:37,670 --> 00:18:38,740


708
00:18:37,770 --> 00:18:38,830
will this kind of shop still open?

709
00:18:39,070 --> 00:18:39,830


710
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:39,920
But I believe

711
00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:41,430


712
00:18:40,210 --> 00:18:41,580
it's not just business

713
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:42,670


714
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:42,820
is not just about business.

715
00:18:47,950 --> 00:18:49,870


716
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:50,020
Fine, be picky.

717
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:57,190


718
00:18:56,730 --> 00:18:57,240
Come in.

719
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:01,350


720
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:01,500
Director Zheng.

721
00:19:03,470 --> 00:19:04,380


722
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:04,530
I don't think it's a good choice

723
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:05,350


724
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:05,560
is not a good choice.

725
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:06,900


726
00:19:06,210 --> 00:19:07,050
We have almost

727
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:08,150


728
00:19:07,050 --> 00:19:08,300
is almost done.

729
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:09,990


730
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:10,140
But you really don't know its situation.

731
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:12,230


732
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:12,370
But we have received the first payment.

733
00:19:12,910 --> 00:19:13,820


734
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:13,970
It's a breach of contract if we don't do it.

735
00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:15,300


736
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:15,450

Try it. Is it good?

923
00:23:34,870 --> 00:23:36,470


924
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,570
Dad's cooking is the best.

925
00:23:42,950 --> 00:23:44,470


926
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:44,620
Why does it taste

927
00:23:44,470 --> 00:23:45,510


928
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:45,600
from Jin's cooking?

929
00:23:47,950 --> 00:23:49,070


930
00:23:48,090 --> 00:23:49,220

932
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:50,880
step by step.

933
00:23:52,910 --> 00:23:54,150


934
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:54,280
What's the difference?

935
00:23:54,870 --> 00:23:55,910


936
00:23:55,030 --> 00:23:55,910
But I still think

937
00:23:56,030 --> 00:23:57,870


938
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:58,020
Dad's cooking is the best.

939
00:23:59,670 --> 00:24:00,870


940
00:23:59,810 --> 00:24:00,800
Then eat more.

941
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:14,030


942
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:13,930
Senior,

943
00:24:14,390 --> 00:24:15,670


944
00:24:14,530 --> 00:24:15,760
can you find the chicken rice now?

945
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:20,070


946
00:24:18,890 --> 00:24:20,110
In this season,

947
00:24:20,630 --> 00:24:21,470


948
00:24:20,770 --> 00:24:21,470
I'll try my best.

949
00:24:24,070 --> 00:24:24,790


950
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:24,950
You two

951
00:24:25,830 --> 00:24:26,790


952
00:24:25,990 --> 00:24:26,870
At this time,

953

954
00:24:27,370 --> 00:24:28,540
at this time?

955
00:24:29,910 --> 00:24:31,630


956
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:31,730
Chicken rice?

957
00:24:34,070 --> 00:24:34,670


958
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:34,820
I don’t know.

959
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:47,710


960
00:24:43,930 --> 00:24:47,860
Mr. Jin, the founder of the century-old store,

961
00:24:45,030 --> 00:24:47,640
[Buerhui and Mr. Jin]

965
00:24:51,290 --> 00:24:53,810
He's from a poor family and has extraordinary skills.

966
00:24:54,110 --> 00:24:56,390


967
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:56,530
He was famous in Jianghu

968
00:24:56,830 --> 00:24:58,670


969
00:24:56,970 --> 00:24:58,820
made him famous.

970
00:24:59,070 --> 00:25:00,230


971
00:24:59,190 --> 00:25:00,340
It's true that

972
00:25:00,230 --> 00:25:01,710


973
00:25:00,370 --> 00:25:01,850
is Miss Jin's specialty.

974
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:12,110


975
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:12,150
Sorry, I found nothing.

976
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:13,870


977
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:13,950
Okay, I'll look for it.

978
00:25:19,230 --> 00:25:19,670


979
00:25:19,370 --> 00:25:19,810
Come in.

980
00:25:29,030 --> 00:25:29,830


981
00:25:29,130 --> 00:25:29,930
Director,

982
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:33,190


983
00:25:31,050 --> 00:25:33,290
Are you still worried about that?

984
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:34,950


985
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:35,100
Have a cup of coffee.

986
00:25:35,310 --> 00:25:36,390


987
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:36,530
Drunk away all sorrows.

988
00:25:36,510 --> 00:25:37,580


989
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:37,710
You asked me to drink coffee so late.

990
00:25:37,910 --> 00:25:38,670


991
00:25:38,010 --> 00:25:38,820
You don't want me to sleep?

992
00:25:39,390 --> 00:25:40,190


993
00:25:39,510 --> 00:25:40,340
You're so beautiful.

994
00:25:40,790 --> 00:25:42,390


995
00:25:40,890 --> 00:25:42,600
This coffee is for me.

996
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:43,670


997
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:43,820
It's your beans.

998
00:25:50,870 --> 00:25:51,950


999
00:25:50,990 --> 00:25:52,070
Don't be stingy.

1000
00:25:52,270 --> 00:25:53,670


1001
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:53,710
I helped you a lot.

1002
00:25:54,750 --> 00:25:56,430


1003
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:56,580
I found that this chicken head soup

1004
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:58,230


1005
00:25:56,650 --> 00:25:58,370
is really Mr. Jin's specialty.

1006
00:25:58,910 --> 00:25:59,550


1007
00:25:59,060 --> 00:25:59,700
But

1008
00:25:59,550 --> 00:26:00,700


1009
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:00,850
it's not the time

1010
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:01,670


1011
00:26:00,850 --> 00:26:01,820
mature season.

1012
00:26:01,950 --> 00:26:03,350


1013
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:03,400
on the market.

1014
00:26:06,510 --> 00:26:08,430


1015
00:26:06,610 --> 00:26:08,530
But I'm not an ordinary person.

1016
00:26:09,070 --> 00:26:09,830


1017
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:09,980
I guess

1018
00:26:09,950 --> 00:26:11,550


1019
00:26:10,070 --> 00:26:11,670
the chicken head should be sent to my home.

1020
00:26:12,310 --> 00:26:12,790


1021
00:26:12,450 --> 00:26:12,940
Really?

1022
00:26:15,230 --> 00:26:16,950


1023
00:26:15,370 --> 00:26:17,090
This chicken head rice is my hometown's specialty.

1024
00:26:17,430 --> 00:26:18,310


1025
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:18,460
My mom always

1026
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:19,430


1027
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:19,570
in the fridge every time.

1028
00:26:19,790 --> 00:26:20,870


1029
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:21,040
There are some left at home.

1030
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:23,550


1031
00:26:21,610 --> 00:26:23,660
But this chicken head rice

1032
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:24,910


1033
00:26:23,910 --> 00:26:25,040
100 yuan per gram.

00:26:25,270 --> 00:26:25,870


1035
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:25,980
It's up to you.

1036
00:26:32,190 --> 00:26:33,190


1037
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,320
Where are my coffee beans?

1038
00:26:33,470 --> 00:26:34,710


1039
00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:34,860
120 yuan per gram.

1040
00:26:35,110 --> 00:26:35,780


1041
00:26:35,230 --> 00:26:35,950
It's up to you.

1042

1043
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:39,570
Alright, I'll drink when I get back.

1044
00:26:39,550 --> 00:26:40,190


1045
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:40,380
Let's go to your house.

1046
00:26:41,190 --> 00:26:41,390


1047
00:26:41,290 --> 00:26:41,540
Let's go.

Go to my house at this hour.

1051
00:26:45,090 --> 00:26:45,490
Wait.

1052

1055
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:48,350
I'll give you a big can when you come back.

1056
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:50,670


1057

Here we are.

1059
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:52,610
How many days have you been collecting these parcels?

1060
00:26:52,550 --> 00:26:53,950


1061
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:54,100
Just these two days.

1062
00:26:54,830 --> 00:26:55,310


1063
00:26:54,990 --> 00:26:55,470
Thank you.

Thank you, Director.

1068

1069
00:27:06,410 --> 00:27:07,180
Which one is it?

1070
00:27:09,070 --> 00:27:10,390


1071
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:10,490
Let me see.

1073
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:13,050
This is chicken head rice.

1074
00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:15,670


1075
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:15,760
I suddenly want to wash my hands.

1076
00:27:15,670 --> 00:27:16,510


1077
00:27:15,790 --> 00:27:16,630
Can I use the bathroom?

1078

1079
00:27:16,930 --> 00:27:17,570
No problem.

1080
00:27:17,710 --> 00:27:18,870


1081
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:19,120
The bathroom is over there.

1083
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:20,080
No need to change your shoes.

1084
00:27:20,590 --> 00:27:20,910


1085
00:27:20,730 --> 00:27:21,060
OK.

1086

1087
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:32,140
There's a pink towel inside.

1088
00:27:31,990 --> 00:27:32,990


1089
00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:33,130

1093
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:35,300
OK.

1095
00:27:38,570 --> 00:27:39,380
Baby.

1096

1097
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:40,090
Are you at home?

1098
