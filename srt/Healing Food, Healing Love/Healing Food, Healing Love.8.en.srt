00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:38,820
Morning.

4
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:40,320
Morning.

5
00:01:41,039 --> 00:01:41,960
Hello, Mr. Ye.

6
00:01:41,979 --> 00:01:42,420
Hello, Mr. Ye.

7
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:42,979
Hello, Mr. Ye.

8
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:43,640
Don't call me that.

9
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:44,550
Just call me Zhiqiu.

10
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:47,289
I heard that you

11
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:48,620
had won many awards abroad.

12
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:50,180
Why did you suddenly come back?

13
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,320
It's because of my wish.

14
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,120
Wish?

15
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,110
What wish?

16
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:55,360
For someone.

17
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:57,680
Is it your childhood sweetheart?

18
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:02,370
Could it be Shen Ying?

19
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:04,640
How could it be me?

20
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:06,380
By the way,

21
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:08,419
how come you have a wish that I don't know?

22
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:09,830
Are you my buddy or not?

23
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:11,620
Don't you know my wish?

24
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:12,770
What wish?

25
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:17,150
Looks like we still have a chance.

26
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:17,900
Of course.

27
00:02:18,850 --> 00:02:19,340
It doesn't matter.

28
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:20,780
When I get the bonus,

29
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:22,079
I'll grant your wish no matter what it is.

30
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:23,210
Good.

31
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:24,680
I want half of your annual bonus.

32
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:27,820
You're pushing your luck, aren't you?

33
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:30,190
Alright.

34
00:02:30,329 --> 00:02:31,570
I have something to do.

35
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:32,329
I have to go.

36
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:33,090
Okay.

37
00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:33,480
Okay.

38
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:34,270
Bye.

39
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:37,220
I'm going back to work.

40
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:38,300
You should, too. Hurry up.

41
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:39,040
Okay.

42
00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:41,380
Now that I think about it...

43
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:42,660
Shen Ying,

44
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:44,180
Miranda is looking for you.

45
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:46,730
I see.

46
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:47,230
I'll be right there.

47
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:47,670
Mr. Ye is shy.

48
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:48,460
He's slow to warm up.

49
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:51,530
Director Zheng is slow to warm up.

50
00:02:52,570 --> 00:02:54,370
You call that "slow to warm up"?

51
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,980
He's just a piece of ice.

52
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:02,950
Why is the live stream data so bad?

53
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,820
-I... -What did you promise me last time?

54
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:08,690
Come in.

55
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:11,260
Miranda, are you looking for me?

56
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:13,410
Ye Zhiqiu just came back.

57
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:14,520
He's not familiar with the environment.

58
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:16,840
You take him to investigate Thirty Degrees South Latitude.

59
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:19,300
But I've been working on the roadside stall project lately.

60
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:19,940
It's okay.

61
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:21,030
Director Zheng

62
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:22,620
can handle that project alone.

63
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,960
Is it really okay?

64
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:28,050
Why not?

65
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:30,210
As my protege,

66
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:31,680
I ask you to go and help

67
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:32,820
my most important partner at the moment.

68
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:34,130
Why isn't it okay?

69
00:03:36,829 --> 00:03:37,790
I think it's perfectly justified

70
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:40,030
that a protege follows his master.

71
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:41,450
Stop talking.

72
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:44,290
Alright.

73
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,650
We'll leave now.

74
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:48,670
Take the plan back and redo it.

75
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:50,840
Okay.

76
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:25,420
Director Zheng,

77
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:26,150
I'm sorry.

78
00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:28,670
I can't go to explore the roadside stalls next time.

79
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:30,620
Miranda insisted that I should investigate

80
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:31,480
the dessert shop with Chubby.

81
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:39,550
Got it.

82
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:43,670
If there's anything in need of me

83
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:45,240
with the street stall project,

84
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:46,810
I will try my best to participate.

85
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:49,370
But this time,

86
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:51,210
I really can't leave.

87
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:06,310
Ying.

88
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:09,960
I've made an appointment at Thirty Degrees South Latitude.

89
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:10,660
Let's go.

90
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:13,720
Let's go.

91
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:17,090
Let's go.

92
00:05:22,910 --> 00:05:23,320
Well...

93
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:24,130
That's all for today.

94
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:24,880
Okay.

95
00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:26,340
Welcome.

96
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:27,990
Hello.

97
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:29,150
I’m Ye Zhiqiu.

98
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,200
I’m here for dessert research and development.

99
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:31,080
Hello.

100
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:32,020
I'm Isen's editor.

101
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:32,630
My name is Shen Ying.

102
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:33,400
Here's my card.

103
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:34,820
We've been waiting for you.

104
00:05:34,890 --> 00:05:35,620
This way, Mr. Ye.

105
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:35,940
Okay.

106
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:36,840
Miss Shen, this way please.

107
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:41,250
Thank you.

108
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:41,980
Here you go.

109
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:42,550
Thank you.

110
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:50,580
Let me help you.

111
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:52,740
It's okay. I can do it myself.

112
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:01,390
I can do it myself.

113
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:11,230
Thanks, Chubby.

114
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:12,480
Don't mention it.

115
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:21,640
Let me interview you a bit.

116
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:24,540
What are you going to make today, Chef Ye?

117
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:26,610
I'll make your favorite dessert, lime pudding.

118
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:29,310
Great!

119
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:32,180
Lime...

120
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:33,850
Let's get started.

121
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:34,360
Okay.

122
00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:37,800
Pudding.

123
00:07:21,630 --> 00:07:22,430
The water is overflowing.

124
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:23,190
What are you doing?

125
00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:48,580
Chubby,

126
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:50,610
I'm going to interview the manager.

127
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:51,400
You make it yourself.

128
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:52,159
No hurry.

129
00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:52,500
Okay.

130
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:31,580
Our guest flow volume is quite good,

131
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:33,309
actually, one of the best in the industry.

132
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:37,960
The number of customers has not been increasing so much lately.

133
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:39,730
So we've cooperated with Isen

134
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,950
and invited the famous dessert master, Mr. Ye,

135
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:43,070
to help us develop new products.

136
00:08:43,650 --> 00:08:44,210
Also,

137
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:45,900
I've read the proposal

138
00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:46,650
you sent.

139
00:08:47,050 --> 00:08:47,970
I'm very satisfied

140
00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:50,110
about it.

141
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:51,570
That's good.

142
00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:52,580
Don't worry.

143
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,830
I will solve your problem.

144
00:08:53,850 --> 00:08:54,160
Okay.

145
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,830
Ying, try it.

146
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:56,440
Okay.

147
00:08:56,890 --> 00:08:57,900
Mr. Ye,

148
00:08:58,460 --> 00:08:59,570
it's stunning!

149
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,020
Thank you.

150
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:00,790
Boss.

151
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:02,740
Coming.

152
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:03,570
Have a seat.

153
00:09:05,710 --> 00:09:06,510
Chubby,

154
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:08,290
you made it so fast.

155
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:09,210
Let me try.

156
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:10,030
Okay.

157
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:13,700
It looks like a crown.

158
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:14,320
Yes.

159
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:15,970
Wait.

160
00:09:16,530 --> 00:09:17,530
That's not how you eat it.

161
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:18,100
Look.

162
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:21,300
You need to crack it first.

163
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:32,980
How is it?

164
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:35,800
It's so delicious.

165
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:37,260
I'll try it myself.

166
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:48,930
You're indeed an excellent chef.

167
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:50,440
Just excellent?

168
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:51,590
No, top-class.

169
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,200
Top-class Chubby, OK?

170
00:09:54,770 --> 00:09:55,250
Ying.

171
00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:02,870
Chubby,

172
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:04,150
you have no idea.

173
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:07,260
Never touch a beauty's hair.

174
00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:12,880
By the way,

175
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:14,830
tell me about your making process.

176
00:10:14,930 --> 00:10:15,540
I'll record it.

177
00:10:16,270 --> 00:10:16,520
Okay.

178
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:18,540
The crown

179
00:10:18,570 --> 00:10:19,930
is made of caramel.

180
00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:22,820
The dessert inside

181
00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:23,870
is actually...

182
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:34,080
This is my plan for the Second Term.

183
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:34,890
Thank you.

184
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,350
Now that you've seen these two plans,

185
00:10:41,710 --> 00:10:43,580
I believe you all have your own judgement.

186
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:44,960
Now,

187
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:46,490
please express your views freely

188
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:48,090
and talk boldly about

189
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:49,820
their strengths and weaknesses,

190
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,120
so that they can have a fair battle.

191
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:55,010
I'll go first.

192
00:10:55,270 --> 00:10:56,740
I think the plan The Sweetest

193
00:10:56,950 --> 00:10:58,110
is more suitable to the current

194
00:10:58,140 --> 00:10:59,950
promoting mode of online marketing.

195
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:01,820
Hiring idols for endorsement

196
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:02,900
can quickly attract fans

197
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:04,820
and get monetized in a short time.

198
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:07,660
Add it to that Mr. Ye is renowned word-wide.

199
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:09,550
I believe we can soon create

200
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:10,520
a phenomenal Internet celebrity shop.

201
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:13,340
From the perspective of the Isen Internet anchors,

202
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,190
it is true that the data of idols is important

203
00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:17,230
in this Internet-dominated world,

204
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:19,660
however, idols also fail often

205
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:20,620
when they promote and sell the products.

206
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:22,970
We can't be obsessed with the power of idols.

207
00:11:23,330 --> 00:11:25,170
We'd better focus on low cost

208
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:26,210
street stalls in a down-to-earth way.

209
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:27,660
At least it won't lose money.

210
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:28,510
Besides,

211
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:29,640
how much can the company afford?

212
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:30,610
Idols are expensive.

213
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:31,800
No need to worry about that.

214
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:33,610
Our client has made their decision about who to hire.

215
00:11:33,850 --> 00:11:35,870
He's Guan Guan, a popular idol at the moment.

216
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:36,950
Speaking of Guan Guan,

217
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:39,090
he was on a famous food variety show before.

218
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:40,740
And his public persona is a chowhound, too.

219
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:42,590
He conforms to the concept of The Sweetest perfectly.

220
00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:45,100
We communicate smoothly

221
00:11:45,310 --> 00:11:46,220
and they are very cooperative.

222
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:48,140
Guan Guan just signed an interview

223
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,160
with Photographer Magazine.

224
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:50,640
-That's our magazine's competitor... -Enough.

225
00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:53,700
This is actually the decision of the senior managers of our company.

226
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,720
The purpose of today's meeting

227
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,440
is to collect your suggestions.

228
00:11:58,150 --> 00:11:59,640
The contract with Guan Guan has been signed.

229
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:02,220
It is imperative.

230
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:03,210
But...

231
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:03,750
Director Zheng,

232
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:05,010
what do your say?

233
00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:06,550
Miranda,

234
00:12:07,010 --> 00:12:08,010
I agree with you.

235
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:10,100
Mr. Ye's plan is very good.

236
00:12:10,210 --> 00:12:12,050
It's perfect for the second issue of Gourmet.

237
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:13,080
OK.

238
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,090
Well then Zhiqiu has to work hard now.

239
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:16,740
Propose the main item as soon as possible.

240
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:18,970
Shen Ying,

241
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:20,050
you go and cooperate with him.

242
00:12:21,310 --> 00:12:22,310
Being new here,

243
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:23,500
he's unfamiliar with many departments.

244
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:27,530
Master.

245
00:12:27,590 --> 00:12:28,790
Master, take it for me. Hurry.

246
00:12:28,930 --> 00:12:29,610
I can't hold it.

247
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:33,370
Are you having only this for lunch?

248
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:35,610
I've had that.

249
00:12:36,170 --> 00:12:37,230
This is the second piece.

250
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:40,520
Come and sit.

251
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:46,980
How are you?

252
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:47,950
Are you

253
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:50,160
adapted to the working style of the paratrooper?

254
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:54,900
You both did a good job

255
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:55,930
in the previous project Bu'erhui.

256
00:12:56,730 --> 00:12:58,940
It's just that it didn't really help with

257
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:00,260
the revenue of our magazine,

258
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,800
which doesn't match our investment at all.

259
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:05,920
I'm under a lot of pressure.

260
00:13:10,370 --> 00:13:11,050
Shen Ying.

261
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,190
I...

262
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,100
hope that

263
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,910
you can keep your own working style.

264
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:18,570
Director Zheng is nice,

265
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:20,100
and very capable, too.

266
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:21,550
But

267
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:23,180
his plan doesn't conform to

268
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:25,310
the current development structure of our magazine.

269
00:13:26,570 --> 00:13:28,230
I need to find

270
00:13:29,230 --> 00:13:29,920
the balance point.

271
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:32,540
Ye Zhiqiu’s project is very suitable for you.

272
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:34,930
Plus, you’ve been friends for years.

273
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:36,240
It'll be easier for you to communicate.

274
00:13:38,770 --> 00:13:39,460
But I'm worried

275
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:40,830
having my hands full with so much work

276
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:42,540
will affect my work efficiency and quality.

277
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,890
You can put your work with Director Zheng aside for now.

278
00:13:45,130 --> 00:13:46,530
I'll talk to him if there's any problem.

279
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:49,190
Okay.

280
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,740
I have a video meeting.

281
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:54,770
I'll go first.

282
00:13:58,270 --> 00:13:59,730
Master, you take this back with you.

283
00:14:01,050 --> 00:14:01,890
Okay.

284
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:04,160
Isn't it enough that you gain weight yourself?

285
00:14:04,810 --> 00:14:06,480
You want me to gain weight too?

286
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:08,420
It's okay to be a bit plump.

287
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:10,560
-I'm back. -Great. You're just on time.

288
00:14:10,590 --> 00:14:10,970
Let's eat.

289
00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:13,050
Ying, time to eat!

290
00:14:13,070 --> 00:14:14,000
She is working overtime.

291
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:14,620
It's just us.

292
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:18,120
What’s going on?

293
00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:21,640
Is it so hard to follow Ye Zhiqiu's project?

294
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:23,280
We haven’t eaten together for days.

295
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,670
How could Ye Zhiqiu bear to make her tired?

296
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:27,590
She volunteered to do

297
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:30,690
some night market project of Zheng Dao.

298
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:31,570
She went to explore possilbe locations.

299
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:32,710
What's going on?

300
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:33,900
If I were her,

301
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:35,060
I wouldn't work with Zheng Dao.

302
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,710
It's so tiring all day.

303
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:37,880
It’s much better to work with Miranda.

304
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:39,650
And you get to work with Ye Zhiqiu every day.

305
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:40,250
Isn't it nice?

306
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:41,870
It's up to her.

307
00:14:42,650 --> 00:14:43,290
Do you think...

308
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:45,630
Could Ying be still suffering from hunger?

309
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:47,310
She must have not eaten.

310
00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:49,310
I put some food aside for her.

311
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:50,370
She can eat as soon as she comes back from work.

312
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:52,230
You're so thoughtful.

313
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:55,360
What?

314
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:56,180
Didn't you ask me to eat?

315
00:14:56,690 --> 00:14:57,670
Wash your hands.

316
00:14:58,790 --> 00:14:59,220
Waiting for you.

317
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:13,220
Supper.

318
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:14,260
I just heated it up at 11.

319
00:15:14,690 --> 00:15:15,370
If it gets cold,

320
00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:16,590
put it in the microwave for a while.

321
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:23,860
Morning, Ying.

322
00:15:25,690 --> 00:15:26,430
Morning, Chubby.

323
00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:28,060
Isn't it a while before the product selection meeting starts?

324
00:15:28,090 --> 00:15:29,120
Why are you here so early?

325
00:15:29,650 --> 00:15:30,100
Yes.

326
00:15:30,450 --> 00:15:31,480
Fan Jian told me

327
00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:33,550
you've been going out early and coming home late these days.

328
00:15:33,730 --> 00:15:34,390
So,

329
00:15:35,530 --> 00:15:38,240
I came early to bring you breakfast.

330
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:41,300
Wow! Sandwich.

331
00:15:41,330 --> 00:15:42,280
Oh my god.

332
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:43,990
If you don't bring it up, I almost forget

333
00:15:44,130 --> 00:15:45,200
I haven't had breakfast yet.

334
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:46,510
No matter how busy you are,

335
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:48,080
you have to eat well

336
00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:48,870
and sleep well.

337
00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:50,620
Otherwise, your parents will be worried.

338
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:52,290
Watch out.

339
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:53,530
I'll tell on you.

340
00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:55,480
Aren't you too old to play such a childish trick?

341
00:16:07,090 --> 00:16:07,970
Morning, Director.

342
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:17,380
Don't you want one?

343
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:18,860
No,

344
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:19,370
you have it.

345
00:16:19,570 --> 00:16:19,840
Okay.

346
00:16:21,070 --> 00:16:22,560
The purpose of our meeting today

347
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:25,140
is to discuss the cooperation plan with Zhiqiu.

348
00:16:25,890 --> 00:16:27,370
The previous theme has been decided.

349
00:16:27,530 --> 00:16:28,490
It's called Odd Dessert.

350
00:16:29,330 --> 00:16:29,760
Zhiqiu,

351
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:31,290
do you have any specific ideas?

352
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:33,780
Since we're innovating,

353
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:35,940
I hope to make Odd Dessert

354
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:37,250
more unique.

355
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:39,740
But how?

356
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,170
I haven't decided yet.

357
00:16:44,950 --> 00:16:45,840
Actually, I think

358
00:16:46,210 --> 00:16:47,440
the ingredients for dessert

359
00:16:47,470 --> 00:16:48,440
have all been used by the predecessors.

360
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:51,220
If we can't innovate the techniques,

361
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:52,500
we can see

362
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:54,140
if we can try some unconventional ingredients.

363
00:16:54,650 --> 00:16:55,030
That's right.

364
00:16:55,590 --> 00:16:57,230
I've discussed many ideas

365
00:16:57,260 --> 00:16:58,400
with the dessert chefs of Thirty Degrees South Latitude,

366
00:16:58,970 --> 00:17:00,150
but none of them are special enough.

367
00:17:00,730 --> 00:17:02,010
So we couldn't make a final decision.

368
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:04,210
I've always had this feeling of greasiness

369
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:06,500
in those desserts.

370
00:17:07,550 --> 00:17:08,119
They're not natural enough.

371
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:11,130
Actually I'm thinking of bitter gourds.

372
00:17:11,650 --> 00:17:12,470
What do you think?

373
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,030
Making desserts with bitter gourds?

374
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:17,960
To grow bitter gourds,

375
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:19,460
a long insolation duration is needed.

376
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:21,290
Meanwhile there should be enough water.

377
00:17:21,770 --> 00:17:22,940
You also need to

378
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:24,290
preserve the moisture of the soil.

379
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:26,540
All these factors contribute to

380
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:28,910
a unique kind of sweetness in bitter gourds.

381
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:30,590
So I think they're very suitable.

382
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:31,420
Right.

383
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:33,180
Bitter gourds can also neutralize

384
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,570
the greasy taste in desserts.

385
00:17:34,990 --> 00:17:36,150
Although it’s a bold idea,

386
00:17:36,570 --> 00:17:38,590
but I think if we make the proportion right,

387
00:17:39,810 --> 00:17:40,660
it might work.

388
00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:41,670
Are you sure?

389
00:17:43,210 --> 00:17:45,050
It indeed is a great challenge

390
00:17:45,810 --> 00:17:47,330
to remove the pungency and bitterness from bitter gourds

391
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:48,940
and keep its original sweetness.

392
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:50,830
However,

393
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:52,980
this is where a dessert chef comes into play.

394
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:54,180
That's why

395
00:17:54,870 --> 00:17:56,160
I think it's worth trying.

396
00:17:57,380 --> 00:17:58,190
I agree with this idea.

397
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:05,630
If there's no objection,

398
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:06,960
it'll be decided then.

399
00:18:07,370 --> 00:18:08,330
Please

400
00:18:08,510 --> 00:18:09,820
continue your work with this idea.

401
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:10,970
Okay.

402
00:18:18,190 --> 00:18:19,010
Let's go together.

403
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:19,540
Okay.

404
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:23,870
Let's go.

405
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:26,780
Goodbye, Director.

406
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:27,230
Goodbye, Director.

407
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:39,260
Why are you still here after work?

408
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:41,540
You came at the right time.

409
00:18:41,810 --> 00:18:43,290
I've selected all the street stalls

410
00:18:43,310 --> 00:18:44,710
and made a gourmet map.

411
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:46,110
There's also a preliminary plan behind.

412
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:47,270
Why did you do this?

413
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:49,660
Though our street stall plan

414
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:50,620
was not approved,

415
00:18:51,090 --> 00:18:52,900
I still think it's quite workable.

416
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:54,890
It's a pity

417
00:18:55,090 --> 00:18:56,030
to just give it up.

418
00:18:56,150 --> 00:18:57,440
Actually, I've already reported this plan

419
00:18:57,690 --> 00:18:59,000
to the headquarters.

420
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,280
It will appear in the third issue of Gourmet.

421
00:19:01,770 --> 00:19:02,490
And in the future,

422
00:19:03,470 --> 00:19:04,490
content of business

423
00:19:04,530 --> 00:19:05,870
will not appear in Gourmet.

424
00:19:07,130 --> 00:19:07,810
Really?

425
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:10,050
The balance of profit and quality

426
00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:11,590
has always been the point of contention between Miranda and me.

427
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:13,900
So in the future, Gourmet will be independent.

428
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:16,060
I see.

429
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,040
Besides,

430
00:19:17,570 --> 00:19:18,840
I don't want you

431
00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:19,670
to be caught between us,

432
00:19:21,170 --> 00:19:22,890
so let's keep a distance from each other

433
00:19:23,530 --> 00:19:25,400
to save your trouble in the future.

434
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:27,710
Okay.

435
00:19:30,810 --> 00:19:31,940
I have a question.

436
00:19:34,890 --> 00:19:37,130
You want to know why I helped Ye Zhiqiu, right?

437
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:42,010
You helped me with the plan out of public interest.

438
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,320
And I'm helping him out of public interest.

439
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:44,150
It's normal.

440
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:47,490
You are quite professional.

441
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,130
Chubby?

442
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:55,290
Hello, Chubby. What is it?

443
00:19:55,830 --> 00:19:56,630
Thirty Degrees South Latitude?

444
00:19:56,980 --> 00:19:58,210
Okay, I'll come later.

445
00:19:59,140 --> 00:19:59,620
Bye.

446
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:02,150
Let's go together.

447
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,220
After all, Gourmet

448
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:06,390
is my responsibility.

449
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:07,610
I'm afraid your work will be

450
00:20:07,610 --> 00:20:09,130
affected by your personal relationship.

451
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:10,260
So I'm going to participate in the whole process.

452
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:12,150
Do you still distrust me?

453
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:13,140
It's not that.

454
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:15,160
Girls are more biased when they're in love.

455
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:16,500
I'm just reminding you.

456
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:18,310
What are you talking about?

457
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:20,650
Are you questioning my pure friendship

458
00:20:20,650 --> 00:20:22,380
or my professionalism?

459
00:20:24,350 --> 00:20:25,060
Good. You're professional.

460
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:25,880
Let's go.

461
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:28,820
What does he mean?

462
00:20:29,650 --> 00:20:31,410
Is he jealous?

463
00:20:33,330 --> 00:20:33,990
Forget it.

464
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:34,920
Impossible.

465
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:36,310
Coming.

466
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:45,880
Chubby, we're here.

467
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:48,280
You two are here.

468
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:49,660
By the way,

469
00:20:50,690 --> 00:20:51,690
I haven't thanked you

470
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:52,460
for approving my proposal.

471
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:54,470
You're welcome.

472
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:55,580
It's for the greater good.

473
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:57,020
Good plans will pass eventually.

474
00:20:58,100 --> 00:20:59,460
See? What did I say?

475
00:21:00,430 --> 00:21:00,730
By the way,

476
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:02,870
today's desserts are sold out.

477
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:04,280
However,

478
00:21:05,270 --> 00:21:06,250
I left one for you.

479
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:07,060
Wait a minute.

480
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:07,580
I'll get it.

481
00:21:07,950 --> 00:21:08,310
Okay.

482
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:12,400
I'm not so keen on sweets.

483
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:13,480
Just try it.

484
00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:13,880
Coming.

485
00:21:14,730 --> 00:21:15,720
This is good.

486
00:21:15,990 --> 00:21:16,880
Try it.

487
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,000
Okay.

488
00:21:18,650 --> 00:21:19,620
Sure.

489
00:21:20,210 --> 00:21:20,560
Have a try.

490
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:26,860
It tastes fresh.

491
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:28,390
Sweet but not greasy.

492
00:21:29,490 --> 00:21:30,250
Director, what do you think?

493
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:31,700
I think it's a little too sweet.

494
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:32,960
It lacks some fragrance.

495
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:35,440
Maybe the ingredients are not right.

496
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:37,170
It would be better to choose

497
00:21:37,310 --> 00:21:38,960
the bitter gourds produced in the north

498
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:40,080
or from the plateau region.

499
00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:40,920
Typical.

500
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:42,770
I'll eat more.

501
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:48,900
The market responded very well to

502
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:50,120
Odd Dessert of Bitter Gourds

503
00:21:50,370 --> 00:21:51,630
completed by the three parties.

504
00:21:52,290 --> 00:21:52,990
Next,

505
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:55,100
we'll wait for Guan Guan to cooperate with our publicity and shooting.

506
00:21:55,470 --> 00:21:58,240
Then we'll try our best to create viral short videos and slogans.

507
00:21:58,680 --> 00:21:59,700
I look forward that it can be more widely known.

508
00:22:00,390 --> 00:22:00,760
Bravo.

509
00:22:02,570 --> 00:22:03,880
Thank you all for your hard work.

510
00:22:04,650 --> 00:22:07,070
And especially thank Director Zheng's suggestion.

511
00:22:08,390 --> 00:22:09,990
The readers and netizens think

512
00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:12,150
the strange and delicious combination

513
00:22:12,170 --> 00:22:13,050
a pleasant surprise.

514
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:14,860
This product has also been

515
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,650
imitated a lot online recently.

516
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:17,330
That's great.

517
00:22:17,890 --> 00:22:19,010
Then hurry up and make hay while the sun shines.

518
00:22:20,290 --> 00:22:21,970
What's Guan Guan's following schedule?

519
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:23,450
We're still waiting to be informed.

520
00:22:24,090 --> 00:22:25,680
They really have a lot of conditions.

521
00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:27,570
His staff

522
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:28,690
is enough to form a tour group.

523
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:29,480
Besides,

524
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,360
they all want to stay in a five-star hotel.

525
00:22:31,570 --> 00:22:32,210
It can't be helped.

526
00:22:32,570 --> 00:22:33,290
He's famous.

527
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:35,630
Please work hard, everybody.

528
00:22:35,910 --> 00:22:36,640
After it's done,

529
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:39,520
the company will give you

530
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:40,870
big bonus.

531
00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:45,920
That's great.

532
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:47,440
I'll do my best to work on this case.

533
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:50,270
It's so hot.

534
00:22:50,550 --> 00:22:51,550
It's early in the morning.

535
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:52,900
I was afraid I would be late.

536
00:22:53,450 --> 00:22:54,780
Who would guess he'd be so late.

537
00:22:55,170 --> 00:22:56,520
-We came so early in the morning. -Why don't they answer?

538
00:22:56,540 --> 00:22:57,630
We waited here for nothing.

539
00:22:58,180 --> 00:22:59,330
Our time is wasted.

540
00:23:00,090 --> 00:23:01,210
Punctuality is the bottom line.

541
00:23:01,410 --> 00:23:02,490
I needn't have gotten up so early.

542
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:03,860
Yeah. Why on earth are we here?

543
00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:08,900
Hello.

544
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:13,740
Okay.

545
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:17,070
That's why?

546
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:18,110
Okay.

547
00:23:19,570 --> 00:23:20,250
I see.

548
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:22,610
Please hurry up, okay?

549
00:23:24,650 --> 00:23:25,170
Okay, thank you.

550
00:23:33,350 --> 00:23:33,900
Everyone,

551
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:35,890
please be quiet.

552
00:23:36,330 --> 00:23:37,090
I'm sorry.

553
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:39,280
Guan Guan's flight was supposed to take off early in the morning.

554
00:23:39,630 --> 00:23:40,450
It was delayed,

555
00:23:40,470 --> 00:23:41,240
so they just arrived.

556
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:43,380
They said they would come to the shooting site as soon as possible.

557
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:44,950
I'm really sorry.

558
00:23:46,050 --> 00:23:47,380
The time has been changed three times.

559
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:48,890
We've waited from 9 to 11.

560
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:50,470
How long do we still have to wait?

561
00:23:51,130 --> 00:23:51,850
That's right.

562
00:23:51,870 --> 00:23:52,510
Yeah, when will it be?

563
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:53,480
It's been half a day.

564
00:23:53,650 --> 00:23:54,570
Yes.

565
00:23:55,130 --> 00:23:55,820
Alright, everyone.

566
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:56,570
How about this?

567
00:23:57,050 --> 00:23:58,530
While you are waiting,

568
00:23:58,790 --> 00:24:00,160
I'll make some desserts for you.

569
00:24:00,590 --> 00:24:02,030
It's also a good chance to warm up the machines.

570
00:24:02,490 --> 00:24:03,410
Later when the shooting begins,

571
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:04,850
we can go more smoothly.

572
00:24:04,990 --> 00:24:05,410
OK?

573
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:06,390
Great!

574
00:24:06,850 --> 00:24:07,690
That's the only way.

575
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:09,700
Okay, let's go.

576
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:11,260
-Go get the equipment. -Enliven the atmosphere.

577
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:17,710
Come on.

578
00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:18,770
Have a taste.

579
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:19,240
Thank you.

580
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:20,260
Thank you.

581
00:24:20,350 --> 00:24:20,730
Thank you.

582
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:21,720
Thank you, Ying.

583
00:24:21,910 --> 00:24:22,550
Thank you.

584
00:24:22,610 --> 00:24:23,260
So beautiful.

585
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:23,950
So beautiful.

586
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:24,440
Master.

587
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:25,260
I don't want it. Help yourself.

588
00:24:25,290 --> 00:24:26,370
Mr. Ye is really good.

589
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:27,990
We didn't wait for nothing.

590
00:24:29,030 --> 00:24:30,190
To be honest,

591
00:24:30,290 --> 00:24:31,710
if the dessert is being sold,

592
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:33,130
you have to queue up for two hours,

593
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:33,610
right?

594
00:24:33,630 --> 00:24:34,070
Yes.

595
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:34,940
I think so too.

596
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:36,340
Good for you.

597
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:38,390
I haven't been trained for nothing all these years.

598
00:24:39,310 --> 00:24:39,900
Thank you.

599
00:24:40,490 --> 00:24:40,940
Thank you.

600
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:43,820
Shen Ying, Director Zheng is here.

601
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:48,560
You went to buy the coffee?

602
00:24:49,050 --> 00:24:50,450
Leave the chores like this to me in the future.

603
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,080
You can share it.

604
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:53,870
Have some coffee to relieve the greasiness.

605
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:55,030
Okay.

606
00:24:56,710 --> 00:24:57,920
Thank you for your coffee, Director Zheng.

607
00:24:58,690 --> 00:24:59,370
Thank you, Director.

608
00:24:59,470 --> 00:24:59,960
Thank you.

609
00:24:59,990 --> 00:25:00,920
Thank you, Director.

610
00:25:01,370 --> 00:25:02,310
-Look! -Come on. Let's drink coffee.

611
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:03,250
Director Zheng is jealous.

612
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:05,150
You're so nosy.

613
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:06,190
Thank you.

614
00:25:06,230 --> 00:25:06,590
Have a drink.

615
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:07,500
Thank you.

616
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:08,760
Come on.

617
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:09,700
Zhuang,

618
00:25:09,730 --> 00:25:10,650
don't you want coffee?

619
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:11,770
You take it.

620
00:25:11,810 --> 00:25:12,570
Shen Ying,

621
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:13,990
Guan Guan is here!

622
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:15,700
Get ready.

623
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:16,540
Get ready to work.

624
00:25:16,730 --> 00:25:17,060
Come on.

625
00:25:19,050 --> 00:25:19,570
It's okay.

626
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:20,170
Hurry up.

627
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:27,660
Mr. Guan Guan.

628
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:34,080
Hello, Mr. Ye.

629
00:25:34,390 --> 00:25:34,940
I'm Guan Guan.

630
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:37,260
How do you know me?

631
00:25:37,290 --> 00:25:38,000
I'll take the umbrella.

632
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:40,020
I overcome all the difficulties to come here

633
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:41,190
just because I heard that I could work with you.

634
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:42,490
Hello, Guan Guan.

635
00:25:42,690 --> 00:25:43,920
I'm responsible for this shooting,

636
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:44,700
Isen's editor.

637
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:46,320
This is...

638
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:48,030
She's my best friend who grew up with me,

639
00:25:48,690 --> 00:25:50,420
and the most famous food editor in Isen,

640
00:25:50,890 --> 00:25:51,480
Shenying.

641
00:25:51,770 --> 00:25:52,720
Hello. Hello.

642
00:25:53,250 --> 00:25:53,720
Hello.

643
00:25:55,150 --> 00:25:56,670
Are you two

644
00:25:56,820 --> 00:25:59,250
childhood sweethearts?

645
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:01,220
That's right.

646
00:26:03,350 --> 00:26:03,810
Guan Guan,

647
00:26:03,830 --> 00:26:04,790
time is limited while the task is heavy.

648
00:26:04,810 --> 00:26:06,200
Let's check the filming process.

649
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:07,010
Okay.

650
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:08,250
Let's talk later.

651
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:08,900
This way, please.

652
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:11,960
Zhuang.

653
00:26:13,770 --> 00:26:14,200
Guan Guan,

654
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:15,760
this is Isen's chief photographer,

655
00:26:15,810 --> 00:26:16,330
Zhuang Yan.

656
00:26:16,350 --> 00:26:17,470
She'll tell you

657
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:18,540
the details of the shooting.

658
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:19,770
Hello, Mr. Guan Guan.

659
00:26:19,790 --> 00:26:20,410
I'm Zhuang Yan.

660
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:21,440
Hello.

661
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:26,690
You can take a brief look first.

662
00:26:26,870 --> 00:26:27,550
These are

663
00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:28,780
the photos designed by our team

664
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:30,420
and approved by your team.

665
00:26:31,490 --> 00:26:32,340
Please have a look.

666
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:36,270
The lighting is so weird.

667
00:26:37,190 --> 00:26:38,250
My manager won't agree

668
00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:39,830
if you make me look so dark-skinned.

669
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:41,810
There may be some misunderstanding.

670
00:26:42,290 --> 00:26:43,320
These photos were designed

671
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:45,240
according to your team’s requirements.

672
00:26:46,030 --> 00:26:46,900
Besides,

673
00:26:47,410 --> 00:26:48,940
based on the time you arrived today,

674
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:50,500
we may not be able to

675
00:26:50,530 --> 00:26:51,550
make more adjustments.

676
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:52,610
What do you mean?

677
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:53,710
"The time I arrived"?

678
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:55,110
I mean...

679
00:27:06,890 --> 00:27:08,120
You go to the costumer first.

680
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:10,160
We'll solve the lighting problem.

681
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:11,520
Go.

682
00:27:12,990 --> 00:27:13,780
Don't worry.

683
00:27:14,170 --> 00:27:14,680
I can do this.

684
00:27:20,010 --> 00:27:20,410
Guan Guan,

685
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:21,720
we can make some adjustments now.

686
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:22,660
Let's try the lighting again.

687
00:27:22,910 --> 00:27:23,420
This way.

688
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:24,350
Okay.

689
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:32,290
Come on. Try it.

690
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:47,970
What's wrong?

691
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:48,880
What are you looking for?

692
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:52,330
I just made desserts for everyone.

693
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:53,760
I've used almost all the whipping cream.

694
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:55,870
We don't have enough cream

695
00:27:56,090 --> 00:27:56,710
for the shooting.

696
00:27:56,910 --> 00:27:57,550
I'll keep looking.

697
00:27:57,790 --> 00:27:58,710
Let me help you.

698
00:27:59,170 --> 00:27:59,480
No need.

699
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:01,260
I can do it myself.

700
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:06,050
Ying.

701
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:07,930
Do you remember

702
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:09,230
when we were little, I often lost my marbles

703
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:10,690
under the sofa or the bed.

704
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:13,050
In the end, I always needed you to fish them out for me.

705
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:15,340
That's because you had fat fingers at the time.

706
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,170
If it were now,

707
00:28:16,190 --> 00:28:16,890
you wouldn't need me.

708
00:28:20,730 --> 00:28:21,940
How much whipping cream did you use?

709
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,170
2.3 liters.

710
00:28:26,110 --> 00:28:26,820
Then there should be no more.

711
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:28,610
The food team only prepared three liters,

712
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:29,850
which was enough for you to shoot 20 times.

713
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:31,720
How about this?

714
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:32,640
I'll buy it now.

715
00:28:34,010 --> 00:28:34,400
Shen Ying.
