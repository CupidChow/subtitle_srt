1
00:00:42,667 --> 00:00:45,962
STRONG GIRL NAM-SOON

2
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:04,731
Would you like…

3
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:08,151
to go out with me?

4
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,321
Go out with you?

5
00:01:18,161 --> 00:01:19,120
You look so startled.

6
00:01:21,122 --> 00:01:22,957
When you weren't around today,

7
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:25,752
I kept wondering about you

8
00:01:26,461 --> 00:01:27,587
and missing you.

9
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:35,386
I wonder why.

10
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:38,139
The way I see it,
I have romantic feelings for you.

11
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:40,683
What do you think?

12
00:01:42,852 --> 00:01:43,895
I'm not sure.

13
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:48,650
Whenever a fun K-drama airs,

14
00:01:48,733 --> 00:01:51,528
I wonder what'll happen next
and want to see the next episode.

15
00:01:52,153 --> 00:01:52,987
Maybe…

16
00:01:54,322 --> 00:01:56,282
it's something like that?

17
00:01:56,908 --> 00:01:58,368
Does my affection for you…

18
00:01:59,869 --> 00:02:00,912
make you uncomfortable?

19
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,250
Don't worry.

20
00:02:07,252 --> 00:02:08,586
I won't push it.

21
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:13,133
Okay.

22
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:19,889
Just a second.

23
00:02:25,019 --> 00:02:25,854
Hello?

24
00:02:30,525 --> 00:02:31,359
What?

25
00:02:44,789 --> 00:02:45,623
Mom,

26
00:02:47,041 --> 00:02:48,459
I have to see Nam-in.

27
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:50,628
I'll call you later.

28
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:03,099
Come to my place now.

29
00:03:03,182 --> 00:03:04,559
The passcode is 1016.

30
00:03:09,772 --> 00:03:11,858
I need to get going.

31
00:03:11,941 --> 00:03:13,109
Something came up.

32
00:03:13,735 --> 00:03:15,236
I'm afraid I won't be back today.

33
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,321
Is it something bad?

34
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:18,698
No…

35
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:20,783
it's no big deal.

36
00:03:22,535 --> 00:03:23,369
Go ahead then.

37
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:24,954
Okay.

38
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:32,003
EPISODE 11
BREAKING POINT

39
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:38,509
Sir?

40
00:03:39,427 --> 00:03:40,470
Sir?

41
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:48,728
Sir?

42
00:03:49,437 --> 00:03:51,272
Sir!

43
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,524
Sir!

44
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:55,610
Sir…

45
00:04:01,032 --> 00:04:02,659
Please send an ambulance.

46
00:04:04,619 --> 00:04:05,620
Hey.

47
00:04:08,623 --> 00:04:10,250
What are you saying?

48
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:16,965
What is it?

49
00:04:17,882 --> 00:04:18,925
The team leader…

50
00:04:22,887 --> 00:04:23,888
passed away.

51
00:04:23,972 --> 00:04:25,056
What?

52
00:04:26,015 --> 00:04:27,141
What the…

53
00:04:27,225 --> 00:04:29,477
But you said he was doing better.

54
00:04:31,354 --> 00:04:33,940
You said he was better!

55
00:04:34,023 --> 00:04:35,066
Damn it!

56
00:04:40,905 --> 00:04:41,906
Damn it.

57
00:04:44,492 --> 00:04:46,035
Sir!

58
00:04:53,584 --> 00:04:55,670
The brown journal on the second bookshelf.

59
00:06:30,389 --> 00:06:33,309
OCTOBER 31, I DIDN'T DRINK WATER
WHILE I WAS AT INSPECTOR KANG'S HOUSE…

60
00:06:48,116 --> 00:06:49,158
Nam-in.

61
00:06:54,497 --> 00:06:56,666
-Nam-in.
-What's going on?

62
00:06:59,043 --> 00:06:59,919
Nam-in.

63
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:02,588
Nam-in?

64
00:07:03,297 --> 00:07:04,382
Nam-in.

65
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:10,763
Send an ambulance to the photo studio.

66
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:12,598
Nam-in needs a hospital.

67
00:07:12,682 --> 00:07:13,975
Call Dr. Choi.

68
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:16,769
What's going on?

69
00:07:16,853 --> 00:07:18,438
And you call yourself his father?

70
00:07:20,022 --> 00:07:21,649
The weight-loss pill he was taking

71
00:07:22,233 --> 00:07:23,067
was a narcotic.

72
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:36,539
-Mom, Dad.
-Nam-soon.

73
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:38,166
Nam-in.

74
00:07:38,249 --> 00:07:40,042
A narcotic?

75
00:07:41,252 --> 00:07:42,128
A narcotic?

76
00:07:42,211 --> 00:07:45,214
The weight-loss pill he was taking
turned out to be a narcotic.

77
00:07:47,175 --> 00:07:49,010
How could it have reached Nam-in?

78
00:07:49,093 --> 00:07:50,386
There's no way.

79
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:51,888
Nam-in would never.

80
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:53,306
Of course he wouldn't.

81
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:55,892
It was disguised as a weight-loss pill.

82
00:07:59,103 --> 00:08:00,521
All he drank was water.

83
00:08:01,397 --> 00:08:03,274
He kept craving more water.

84
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:10,907
I have to save my son.

85
00:08:11,866 --> 00:08:12,950
Nam-in.

86
00:08:23,419 --> 00:08:24,253
Gan I-sik,

87
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:25,838
-Nam-in--
-My team leader

88
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:28,090
passed away.

89
00:08:36,891 --> 00:08:39,143
-Goodness.
-My goodness…

90
00:08:39,227 --> 00:08:41,521
Dong-seok, my boy.

91
00:08:42,146 --> 00:08:44,398
My poor boy.

92
00:08:44,482 --> 00:08:45,983
How did this even happen?

93
00:08:46,067 --> 00:08:47,485
My poor son!

94
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:49,237
What do we do?

95
00:08:59,622 --> 00:09:01,415
Don't give him water when he wakes up.

96
00:09:01,499 --> 00:09:02,750
He must not drink it.

97
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:04,627
Don't even give him a single drop

98
00:09:05,795 --> 00:09:07,505
for the next 24 hours, okay?

99
00:09:07,588 --> 00:09:09,215
How can we not give him water?

100
00:09:12,176 --> 00:09:13,010
All right.

101
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:15,388
For now,

102
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:17,598
give your boss a proper send-off.

103
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:21,644
I don't think I can come
because of Nam-in.

104
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:23,145
I understand.

105
00:09:42,373 --> 00:09:43,457
Mom, Dad.

106
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:45,418
There's an antidote.

107
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:47,628
How do you know that?

108
00:09:47,712 --> 00:09:50,047
Hee-sik heard about it
over the bug at the Heritage Club.

109
00:09:50,798 --> 00:09:53,050
I've actually been helping
with his investigation.

110
00:09:53,134 --> 00:09:55,803
-What?
-But that's a story for another day.

111
00:09:56,512 --> 00:09:57,513
An antidote?

112
00:09:58,306 --> 00:10:00,016
So that was it all along.

113
00:10:04,478 --> 00:10:06,522
Once the test results come back,

114
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:08,149
I'll notify you directly, ma'am.

115
00:10:08,232 --> 00:10:09,275
Doctor,

116
00:10:09,817 --> 00:10:11,485
I heard he shouldn't drink water.

117
00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:12,486
Sorry?

118
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:14,488
Wouldn't that include his IV drip?

119
00:10:14,572 --> 00:10:15,865
Even if it did,

120
00:10:15,948 --> 00:10:18,117
there's no other treatment we can give him

121
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:21,329
for such an extreme case
of malnutrition and dehydration.

122
00:10:29,337 --> 00:10:30,713
Give me Nam-in's phone.

123
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:32,048
I want to go through it.

124
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:36,636
It's no use.

125
00:10:37,345 --> 00:10:40,973
There’s no mention of it
in any texts or messenger apps.

126
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:46,437
Then how the hell
did he come by those pills?

127
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:47,855
I'll catch them.

128
00:10:47,938 --> 00:10:50,399
I'll do whatever I can to catch

129
00:10:52,276 --> 00:10:53,986
and kill whoever did this to Nam-in.

130
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:57,281
Is the bank account number on the pillbox
the only lead we have?

131
00:11:02,119 --> 00:11:03,079
Nam-soon,

132
00:11:03,621 --> 00:11:05,122
go with your dad.

133
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:06,749
He's lost it.

134
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:08,209
Look after him for us.

135
00:11:08,292 --> 00:11:09,919
I'll take care of Nam-in.

136
00:11:11,295 --> 00:11:12,463
Got it.

137
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:15,341
Don't give him water when he wakes up,

138
00:11:15,424 --> 00:11:16,342
all right?

139
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:20,554
All right, I got it.

140
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:37,822
Hi, it's me.

141
00:11:39,156 --> 00:11:41,075
Yes, of course. I'm doing fine.

142
00:11:41,158 --> 00:11:44,120
I'm afraid I need to
ask you a favor, Mr. Park.

143
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:46,372
If I give you an account number,

144
00:11:46,914 --> 00:11:48,916
could you look up who owns it?

145
00:11:50,292 --> 00:11:51,794
I know it's illegal.

146
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:53,421
That's why I'm asking for a favor.

147
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:56,382
No?

148
00:11:58,342 --> 00:11:59,468
Fine. Forget it!

149
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:12,606
Dad.

150
00:12:13,524 --> 00:12:14,775
I'll find them.

151
00:12:14,859 --> 00:12:16,569
I'll find who drugged Nam-in.

152
00:12:16,652 --> 00:12:19,447
How though?
All you have is the account number.

153
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:21,157
I used to work at a bank.

154
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:24,076
My former colleagues
are all branch managers now.

155
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,911
They'll help me if I ask in person.

156
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:29,707
Wouldn't it be faster
to ask for the police's help?

157
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:37,214
Ms. Gang.

158
00:12:37,882 --> 00:12:38,799
Good evening, Officer Yeo.

159
00:12:38,883 --> 00:12:40,968
My gosh, you're using formal speech now.

160
00:12:41,051 --> 00:12:41,969
This is my dad.

161
00:12:42,052 --> 00:12:44,763
I was happy to hear
you had found your family.

162
00:12:44,847 --> 00:12:45,848
Hello, sir.

163
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:47,433
Hello.

164
00:12:47,516 --> 00:12:50,227
We came by to ask for a favor.

165
00:12:51,103 --> 00:12:52,396
CRIMINAL RECORDS CHECK

166
00:12:53,063 --> 00:12:54,940
This was the number on the pill's case.

167
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:57,193
We need to know
who this bank account belongs to.

168
00:12:57,276 --> 00:12:58,444
Did you file a report?

169
00:12:58,527 --> 00:13:00,821
Doing all that will take too long.

170
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:02,573
This is an emergency.

171
00:13:02,656 --> 00:13:04,200
We have no time to waste.

172
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:05,451
Please, officer.

173
00:13:06,577 --> 00:13:08,662
Any personal information
obtained while on duty

174
00:13:08,746 --> 00:13:10,831
can't be shared with civilians, Mr. Gang.

175
00:13:10,915 --> 00:13:12,208
But we need to know.

176
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:14,543
-My son--
-Dad.

177
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:17,505
Even if we get a name,
tracking them down won't be easy.

178
00:13:18,506 --> 00:13:20,549
-The more urgent issue--
-I need the antidote.

179
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:24,845
I need to get the cure for my son

180
00:13:24,929 --> 00:13:27,348
from these people.

181
00:13:29,683 --> 00:13:30,851
Please.

182
00:13:31,435 --> 00:13:34,813
Can you at least tell me
their contact information?

183
00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:43,197
Well,

184
00:13:44,782 --> 00:13:47,409
it's illegal for me
to hand you the information.

185
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:50,329
But if I were to leave my desk…

186
00:13:50,996 --> 00:13:51,997
I mean,

187
00:13:52,081 --> 00:13:55,084
if you happened to look at it
while I wasn't around,

188
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:57,002
that wouldn't count as handing it to you.

189
00:14:00,464 --> 00:14:02,216
I'll be heading to the restroom.

190
00:14:09,306 --> 00:14:11,267
"Date of birth, March 22nd, 1978.
Jang Hang-seok."

191
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:13,143
"Seodaemun-gu, Seoul…"

192
00:14:17,439 --> 00:14:18,774
But I doubt he's the guy.

193
00:14:20,818 --> 00:14:23,153
You're right. This isn't who we're after.

194
00:14:23,237 --> 00:14:25,698
They would've used a fake
or a homeless person's ID.

195
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:28,909
I saw many such cases
while working at the bank.

196
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:31,078
Fake bank accounts.

197
00:14:31,161 --> 00:14:32,413
A homeless person?

198
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:35,332
I'm not the man I once was.

199
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:37,751
I'm seeing someone else.

200
00:14:39,044 --> 00:14:41,213
She exudes a floral fragrance.

201
00:14:41,297 --> 00:14:42,506
However,

202
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:43,966
that wasn't the case with you.

203
00:14:45,175 --> 00:14:46,176
I no longer harbor…

204
00:14:47,094 --> 00:14:48,262
any feelings for you.

205
00:14:48,345 --> 00:14:49,430
Cut!

206
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:57,479
Hyun-soo,

207
00:14:57,563 --> 00:14:59,982
you're using that stuffy tone again.

208
00:15:00,065 --> 00:15:01,442
"She smells like flowers."

209
00:15:01,525 --> 00:15:03,277
"I don't love you anymore."

210
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,778
Speak more casually.

211
00:15:04,862 --> 00:15:06,405
Who's this wordy when breaking up?

212
00:15:06,488 --> 00:15:08,449
Did you date a teacher before
or something?

213
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:11,619
This is what a pampered life does to you.

214
00:15:12,119 --> 00:15:13,662
I'm sorry. I'll try that again.

215
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:15,164
Let's take a short break.

216
00:15:15,998 --> 00:15:17,041
We're taking a break.

217
00:15:21,378 --> 00:15:22,254
NAM-SOON

218
00:15:23,088 --> 00:15:23,923
Hello?

219
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:26,675
Hey, Nam-soon.

220
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:28,135
I hope you're well.

221
00:15:28,218 --> 00:15:30,679
I called to ask for a favor.

222
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:32,097
Could you check

223
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:36,352
if there's a homeless person
by the name of Jang Hang-seok

224
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:37,853
who was born in 1978?

225
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:40,022
A Jang Hang-seok who was born in 1978?

226
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:42,566
Are you sure he's homeless?

227
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:44,526
There's a good chance he is.

228
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:45,861
Could you look into it?

229
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:47,321
Sure, I'd do anything for you.

230
00:15:47,404 --> 00:15:50,074
Could you do it fast? Thanks in advance.

231
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:01,961
Don't worry too much, Dad.

232
00:16:02,044 --> 00:16:03,545
The police will help us.

233
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:05,130
I don't trust the police

234
00:16:05,214 --> 00:16:06,507
or the embassy.

235
00:16:07,508 --> 00:16:08,842
I trust no one.

236
00:16:09,551 --> 00:16:11,136
When I lost you,

237
00:16:11,762 --> 00:16:13,138
I put my faith in the police.

238
00:16:14,098 --> 00:16:15,766
I slept at police stations

239
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:18,143
and protested outside the embassy.

240
00:16:18,894 --> 00:16:19,979
I did everything.

241
00:16:21,063 --> 00:16:22,398
But they still couldn't find you.

242
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:24,358
No, they didn't even bother.

243
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:28,028
This is up to me.

244
00:16:28,112 --> 00:16:29,196
I have to step up

245
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:31,949
to save Nam-in.

246
00:16:34,618 --> 00:16:37,121
I'll make sure nothing happens to him.

247
00:16:37,204 --> 00:16:38,330
Let me handle it.

248
00:16:38,414 --> 00:16:39,581
We need

249
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:42,001
to get the antidote.

250
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:47,047
Those selling the drug
also have the antidote.

251
00:16:48,757 --> 00:16:51,343
The details about the drug
are none of my concern.

252
00:16:51,927 --> 00:16:53,971
That's for the police to handle.

253
00:16:54,054 --> 00:16:55,639
I just need to save my son.

254
00:16:57,474 --> 00:16:58,976
I have to get him the antidote.

255
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:02,771
They might be
the most heinous criminals out there,

256
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:05,107
but to me,

257
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:11,864
they're the ones who can save Nam-in.

258
00:17:27,588 --> 00:17:28,756
Nam-in?

259
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:33,719
-Mom.
-That's right. It's me.

260
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:35,512
How are you feeling?

261
00:17:41,101 --> 00:17:42,811
Mom, water.

262
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:45,189
Hurry. Give me water.

263
00:17:45,272 --> 00:17:46,106
No.

264
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:47,316
You can't have water.

265
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:50,277
Water!

266
00:17:52,279 --> 00:17:53,113
-Nam-in!
-Water.

267
00:17:53,197 --> 00:17:54,698
Water!

268
00:17:55,365 --> 00:17:57,326
Give me water!

269
00:17:58,327 --> 00:17:59,870
Give me water!

270
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:04,500
Water!

271
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,942
Mom…

272
00:18:31,401 --> 00:18:32,736
Help me.

273
00:18:47,918 --> 00:18:49,128
Look into my eyes.

274
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,338
I'll save you.

275
00:18:51,421 --> 00:18:53,006
I won't let you die!

276
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:55,217
You need to fight this.

277
00:19:01,014 --> 00:19:02,891
It'll be all right, Nam-in.

278
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:04,768
You'll be all right.

279
00:19:04,852 --> 00:19:07,020
Nam-in, listen to me.

280
00:19:08,063 --> 00:19:08,981
Tell me

281
00:19:10,107 --> 00:19:11,525
where you got those pills.

282
00:19:12,484 --> 00:19:13,527
Someone…

283
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:17,114
came by my café.

284
00:19:18,282 --> 00:19:19,158
Someone…

285
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:22,161
approached me.

286
00:19:38,468 --> 00:19:39,511
Ms. Jung.

287
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:42,639
The time has come.

288
00:19:56,486 --> 00:19:57,487
A light that's fake…

289
00:19:58,989 --> 00:20:00,157
or a light that's real?

290
00:20:20,344 --> 00:20:21,845
The overseas shipment passed customs,

291
00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:24,556
and delivery was completed 40 minutes ago.

292
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:26,725
-Good work.
-Thank you.

293
00:20:26,808 --> 00:20:27,893
By the way…

294
00:20:28,936 --> 00:20:30,646
it's about Tsetseg.

295
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:34,191
Is there a reason why you brought her
onto the corporate relations team?

296
00:20:34,274 --> 00:20:35,776
Has there been a problem?

297
00:20:35,859 --> 00:20:37,903
While I'm not questioning your judgment,

298
00:20:38,654 --> 00:20:40,322
she didn't come to work today

299
00:20:40,405 --> 00:20:43,450
and has been having trouble
communicating with the team.

300
00:20:44,117 --> 00:20:45,661
I just figured I'd ask.

301
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:47,746
-She's not at work?
-No.

302
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:53,001
I've checked the shipment from Doogo.

303
00:20:53,585 --> 00:20:54,920
The thing is,

304
00:20:55,545 --> 00:20:57,339
one item is missing.

305
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:01,176
The amount I received
didn't match the number on the invoice.

306
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:05,430
It seems as though one was stolen.

307
00:21:06,056 --> 00:21:10,394
Each jacket contains
a million dollars' worth of product.

308
00:21:10,978 --> 00:21:13,063
How should I proceed?

309
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:15,774
Noted.

310
00:21:36,837 --> 00:21:37,921
Nam-in.

311
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,007
Hang in there.

312
00:21:41,049 --> 00:21:42,384
You can do it.

313
00:21:45,095 --> 00:21:46,096
I'm…

314
00:21:46,888 --> 00:21:47,973
so sorry.

315
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:04,364
Get to work right away.

316
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:06,491
-Yes, ma'am.
-Yes, ma'am.

317
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:16,543
What brings you here, Joong-gan?

318
00:22:17,753 --> 00:22:19,713
I may ask you the same thing, Jun-hee.

319
00:22:19,796 --> 00:22:21,965
Well, Mr. Gang's in the hospital.

320
00:22:22,049 --> 00:22:24,051
I should keep things running for him.

321
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:27,888
How did you know
my grandson was in the hospital?

322
00:22:27,971 --> 00:22:28,972
Geum-dong told me.

323
00:22:29,556 --> 00:22:31,683
Your son gave me a call.

324
00:22:33,602 --> 00:22:35,103
I have no idea what's going on.

325
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:36,772
Everyone's landing in the hospital.

326
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:41,068
Geum-ju told me to stay at the café.

327
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:46,990
I told you to trust me, didn't I?

328
00:22:49,242 --> 00:22:50,619
My sense of sportsmanship

329
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:53,914
is the only thing keeping me
from confronting your husband.

330
00:22:54,831 --> 00:22:57,167
He's a man recovering from surgery.

331
00:22:58,043 --> 00:23:02,005
The last thing I want to do
is kick someone while they're down.

332
00:23:03,965 --> 00:23:06,927
I will fight for our love.

333
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:11,431
It won't be easy.

334
00:23:11,515 --> 00:23:14,476
No one will celebrate our relationship.

335
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:16,561
It's not like you to show weakness.

336
00:23:16,645 --> 00:23:17,687
Didn't you say you loved me?

337
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:21,108
Love can't solve everything.

338
00:23:21,191 --> 00:23:22,567
Yes, it can.

339
00:23:23,485 --> 00:23:25,904
Why should we get scared
when we have nothing to lose?

340
00:23:32,661 --> 00:23:33,995
Be patient.

341
00:23:34,704 --> 00:23:37,457
I'll face him and end things
once and for all.

342
00:23:38,166 --> 00:23:39,126
How long…

343
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:42,671
am I supposed to wait?

344
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:47,467
Just until his stitches come out.

345
00:23:49,845 --> 00:23:52,889
That's my deadline.

346
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:56,143
The man must at least
be free of his stitches.

347
00:23:57,227 --> 00:23:58,645
I'd rather not be a coward.

348
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:02,899
Have some coffee.

349
00:24:02,983 --> 00:24:05,694
I'll top it off with latte art
shaped like a diamond.

350
00:24:06,945 --> 00:24:07,821
Make it a ruby.

351
00:24:08,405 --> 00:24:11,449
The person you called is not available.
Please leave a message…

352
00:24:11,992 --> 00:24:13,577
TSETSEG

353
00:24:27,591 --> 00:24:31,178
BEOM

354
00:24:38,852 --> 00:24:39,728
Yes?

355
00:24:39,811 --> 00:24:41,897
This is about shipment 4885.

356
00:24:42,397 --> 00:24:43,440
One's missing.

357
00:24:43,523 --> 00:24:44,774
That's impossible.

358
00:24:44,858 --> 00:24:47,819
Is this how you manage shipments?

359
00:24:48,445 --> 00:24:50,697
I did the final inventory myself.

360
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:54,034
Do whatever it takes
to find the missing item within 24 hours.

361
00:24:55,118 --> 00:24:56,620
You know what'll happen

362
00:24:57,954 --> 00:24:59,915
if you don't.

363
00:25:00,749 --> 00:25:01,583
Of course.

364
00:25:12,844 --> 00:25:13,929
They still only see me

365
00:25:15,013 --> 00:25:18,600
as Anton, the ten-year-old boy
under their thumb.

366
00:25:57,806 --> 00:25:59,474
We have to get out of here.

367
00:25:59,557 --> 00:26:02,310
Otherwise, we'll both die.

368
00:26:03,019 --> 00:26:05,772
You have to make it out of here, Anton.

369
00:26:06,356 --> 00:26:07,983
Keep on fighting.

370
00:26:09,067 --> 00:26:10,277
You too.

371
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:12,737
We'll get our revenge when we're older.

372
00:26:37,178 --> 00:26:38,179
Mr. Yang,

373
00:26:39,014 --> 00:26:40,307
my office, please.

374
00:26:53,069 --> 00:26:54,362
Did you want to see me, sir?

375
00:26:54,446 --> 00:26:56,698
-One of the items was missing.
-Excuse me?

376
00:26:56,781 --> 00:26:58,700
Which one, sir?

377
00:26:58,783 --> 00:27:02,078
Among the 1,000 puffer jackets
sent to the Russian Port of Kienov,

378
00:27:03,121 --> 00:27:04,748
one went missing.

379
00:27:04,831 --> 00:27:05,874
Just one?

380
00:27:08,043 --> 00:27:10,253
The logistics team must've made an error.

381
00:27:11,212 --> 00:27:14,007
It's no big deal.
We can send an additional one by post--

382
00:27:14,090 --> 00:27:15,216
You.

383
00:27:17,218 --> 00:27:18,470
What did you just say?

384
00:27:20,013 --> 00:27:23,808
Of course mistakes like this
shouldn't be made at all,

385
00:27:23,892 --> 00:27:26,686
but one missing jacket

386
00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:29,397
would hardly cost us the deal…

387
00:27:35,236 --> 00:27:38,156
I'll make sure nothing like this
ever happens again, sir.

388
00:27:38,698 --> 00:27:40,325
Tell the truck driver
who made the delivery

389
00:27:42,035 --> 00:27:43,661
to come and see me immediately.

390
00:27:44,788 --> 00:27:45,789
Yes, sir.

391
00:27:58,259 --> 00:28:01,096
He met with Hairtail on purpose
to collect evidence.

392
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:02,931
Our team leader

393
00:28:03,431 --> 00:28:05,308
made himself the evidence.

394
00:28:05,392 --> 00:28:06,267
You're right.

395
00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:07,936
He was dying under our noses.

396
00:28:08,978 --> 00:28:12,023
He was trying to handle the case
all on his own.

397
00:28:12,107 --> 00:28:13,441
And I had no clue.

398
00:28:16,611 --> 00:28:18,363
So what now?

399
00:28:18,446 --> 00:28:19,781
Let's come up with a plan.

400
00:28:20,615 --> 00:28:22,826
If we hand this over
to the Prosecutors' Office--

401
00:28:22,909 --> 00:28:25,662
Then he'll go down as a drug addict.

402
00:28:26,955 --> 00:28:30,959
Everyone who's rich and powerful
is a part of the Heritage Club.

403
00:28:31,042 --> 00:28:34,129
The deputy chief prosecutors and judges
of Seoul Central District Court,

404
00:28:34,212 --> 00:28:35,964
and even Commissioner General An.

405
00:28:39,008 --> 00:28:40,051
Where are you going?

406
00:28:44,514 --> 00:28:47,434
Keep the team leader company
during his final moments.

407
00:28:48,601 --> 00:28:50,311
He's been lonely for too long.

408
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:04,743
Ryu Si-o, I'm coming for you.

409
00:29:56,044 --> 00:29:57,378
Listen to me carefully.

410
00:30:00,256 --> 00:30:01,716
An item went missing.

411
00:30:03,885 --> 00:30:07,180
What happened on the way
from the warehouse to the port?

412
00:30:07,764 --> 00:30:08,890
Think it over.

413
00:30:11,226 --> 00:30:13,394
Did you take a jacket out to wear
because it was cold

414
00:30:13,478 --> 00:30:14,771
or did someone

415
00:30:16,314 --> 00:30:18,691
raid your truck en route?

416
00:30:20,443 --> 00:30:22,237
Raise your right hand
if anything comes to mind.

417
00:30:23,071 --> 00:30:24,989
If your input helps me retrieve it,

418
00:30:26,825 --> 00:30:27,992
you'll get to live.

419
00:30:32,455 --> 00:30:33,456
However,

420
00:30:34,958 --> 00:30:37,710
if you fail to provide
any helpful information,

421
00:30:38,962 --> 00:30:40,964
I'll rip your mouth open
with this golf club.

422
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:44,217
It'll then go past your mouth

423
00:30:44,759 --> 00:30:46,386
and down your throat.

424
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:49,138
Where do you think it'll reach next?

425
00:30:52,267 --> 00:30:54,269
It's long enough, wouldn't you say?

426
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:25,466
Whenever you're ready.

427
00:31:29,262 --> 00:31:32,015
It was about 40 minutes
after I left the warehouse.

428
00:31:33,016 --> 00:31:34,434
I don't remember where it was,

429
00:31:34,517 --> 00:31:36,394
but a woman asked for help with her car,

430
00:31:36,978 --> 00:31:38,730
so I pulled over.

431
00:31:38,813 --> 00:31:39,814
Other than that,

432
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:41,983
I didn't do anything,
let alone steal an item.

433
00:31:42,066 --> 00:31:43,234
I swear.

434
00:31:43,776 --> 00:31:45,612
It's the truth, sir.

435
00:31:58,583 --> 00:32:01,210
Get me the footage
from his truck's dashcam.

436
00:32:05,256 --> 00:32:08,426
Stop by the restroom on your way out.

437
00:32:09,177 --> 00:32:11,346
He looks like he really needs it.

438
00:32:13,181 --> 00:32:15,558
Please don't kill me.

439
00:32:26,986 --> 00:32:29,155
You will be redirected to voicemail.

440
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:32,033
It's me, Si-o.

441
00:32:35,161 --> 00:32:37,330
Why aren't you at the office
without calling in?

442
00:32:37,413 --> 00:32:38,581
You're making me worried.

443
00:32:39,916 --> 00:32:41,334
Is everything all right?

444
00:32:43,544 --> 00:32:44,379
Or…

445
00:32:46,339 --> 00:32:48,216
I'm only asking this out of guilt,

446
00:32:50,259 --> 00:32:53,554
but are you avoiding me
because I asked you to go out with me?

447
00:32:56,265 --> 00:32:58,184
Whatever it is, I'll understand,

448
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:00,353
so please call me back.

449
00:33:02,981 --> 00:33:04,440
I'm worried about you.

450
00:33:20,957 --> 00:33:22,792
It's as expected. The address was fake.

451
00:33:22,875 --> 00:33:24,293
Jang Hang-seok doesn't live here.

452
00:33:24,377 --> 00:33:25,336
He must be homeless.

453
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:27,547
A ton of homeless people have been
registered as living at that address.

454
00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:29,298
A ton of mail was stacked outside.

455
00:33:29,382 --> 00:33:30,216
Let's wait.

456
00:33:30,299 --> 00:33:32,218
My friend said he'd call after his shoot.

457
00:33:32,301 --> 00:33:34,303
You said you were helping
the police earlier.

458
00:33:34,387 --> 00:33:35,221
What was that about?

459
00:33:35,304 --> 00:33:36,681
The CEO I work for

460
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:39,142
distributes the drugs.

461
00:33:40,143 --> 00:33:41,728
-What?
-The team leader of the DIU

462
00:33:42,395 --> 00:33:44,480
passed away while investigating this case.

463
00:33:45,857 --> 00:33:47,734
We have to get that CEO behind bars soon.

464
00:33:48,735 --> 00:33:49,736
Hold on.

465
00:33:50,695 --> 00:33:53,239
Did you get a job at that company
just to bring him down?

466
00:33:54,907 --> 00:33:56,159
Did your mom put you up to this?

467
00:33:56,993 --> 00:33:59,787
-Dad--
-I don't get your mother at all!

468
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:02,999
Why would she put
her own daughter in harm's way?

469
00:34:03,082 --> 00:34:03,916
Is she insane?

470
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,044
I volunteered to do it.

471
00:34:07,754 --> 00:34:09,172
This is something I have to do.

472
00:34:10,089 --> 00:34:11,507
It was my own choice.

473
00:34:16,763 --> 00:34:17,638
It's Mom.

474
00:34:19,557 --> 00:34:20,475
Hey, Mom.

475
00:34:23,436 --> 00:34:24,896
Nam-in's awake?

476
00:34:26,689 --> 00:34:27,857
What a relief.

477
00:34:29,776 --> 00:34:30,693
You want me to watch him?

478
00:34:30,777 --> 00:34:32,070
Okay, I'll be right there--

479
00:34:34,363 --> 00:34:36,115
Stay there and watch Nam-in!

480
00:34:36,616 --> 00:34:38,326
What's the point of earning more money?

481
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:42,080
Are you bent on going down in history
as the richest person in Korea?

482
00:34:42,163 --> 00:34:43,706
What do your children mean to you?

483
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:44,707
And what about me?

484
00:34:45,708 --> 00:34:47,001
You'll do as you're told.

485
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:48,044
Got it?

486
00:34:49,128 --> 00:34:50,379
You watch over Nam-in.

487
00:34:50,463 --> 00:34:51,798
Don't do anything else.

488
00:34:52,673 --> 00:34:54,801
He shouldn't eat anything right now.

489
00:34:54,884 --> 00:34:56,552
And you better not either!

490
00:34:56,636 --> 00:34:58,012
I'll starve as well.

491
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:06,979
Damn her.

492
00:35:13,694 --> 00:35:16,531
You should go ahead
and contact that former homeless person.

493
00:35:17,073 --> 00:35:18,825
He could be done with filming by now.

494
00:35:18,908 --> 00:35:19,742
Right.

495
00:35:21,744 --> 00:35:22,578
Got it.

496
00:35:23,287 --> 00:35:24,497
Hey, Nam-soon.

497
00:35:25,373 --> 00:35:26,916
I was just about to call.

498
00:35:26,999 --> 00:35:28,543
I found Jang Hang-seok.

499
00:35:29,669 --> 00:35:30,837
He found the guy.

500
00:35:31,671 --> 00:35:33,798
Jang Hang-seok was indeed
a homeless person.

501
00:35:35,049 --> 00:35:36,175
Let's go.

502
00:35:38,344 --> 00:35:39,887
GEUMJU TV NEWS

503
00:35:50,606 --> 00:35:51,983
Hello, everyone.

504
00:35:52,483 --> 00:35:55,444
Geumju TV,
the channel that brings you news

505
00:35:55,528 --> 00:35:58,406
not covered by other channels,
will begin to air in 23 days.

506
00:35:58,489 --> 00:36:00,616
Today, we bring you a test broadcast.

507
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,035
Note that this may be a test broadcast,

508
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:05,621
but we're delivering hard facts only.

509
00:36:06,372 --> 00:36:08,958
An undetectable illicit drug

510
00:36:09,041 --> 00:36:11,002
has been wreaking havoc on Gangnam, Seoul,

511
00:36:11,085 --> 00:36:15,423
South Korea, and the rest of the world.

512
00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:17,466
However, despite its deadliness,

513
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:20,845
a proper investigation into it
has yet to have begun.

514
00:36:20,928 --> 00:36:24,473
This is due to a serious flaw
in the criminal procedure

515
00:36:24,557 --> 00:36:27,768
where a search and seizure warrant
can't be issued to the main distributor.

516
00:36:27,852 --> 00:36:30,104
Let us hear from
Geumju Daily's reporter Kim Gi-dae,

517
00:36:30,188 --> 00:36:32,273
who has been gathering information

518
00:36:32,356 --> 00:36:34,817
regarding the damage the drug has caused.

519
00:36:34,901 --> 00:36:39,864
So far, this deadly synthetic drug
of an unknown composition

520
00:36:39,947 --> 00:36:42,700
has officially claimed 732 lives

521
00:36:43,242 --> 00:36:47,872
and more than 3,000
by unofficial estimates.

522
00:36:47,955 --> 00:36:49,498
If we add the number of people

523
00:36:49,582 --> 00:36:52,877
who died from a substance
with a similar chemical compound,

524
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:56,380
it is assumed to be well over 10,000.

525
00:36:56,464 --> 00:36:59,342
This substance, which becomes
a synthetic drug when reacted with water,

526
00:36:59,425 --> 00:37:02,053
may be humanity's worst invention.

527
00:37:02,136 --> 00:37:05,056
Its fatality rate is 1,000 times higher
than currently known illicit drugs.

528
00:37:05,806 --> 00:37:09,685
It causes severe thirst, hallucinations,
and eventually leads to death.

529
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:14,023
This deadly new synthetic drug

530
00:37:14,106 --> 00:37:17,318
is known as CTA4885.

531
00:37:43,678 --> 00:37:45,346
Mr. Shin Gang-su.

532
00:37:45,972 --> 00:37:48,683
You're under arrest for the violation
of the Narcotics Control Act

533
00:37:48,766 --> 00:37:51,018
and the Act on the Aggravated Punishment
of Specific Crimes.

534
00:37:51,102 --> 00:37:55,189
You have the right to remain silent
and the right to an attorney.

535
00:37:55,273 --> 00:37:58,192
Anything you say can and will
be used against you in a court of law.

536
00:37:59,735 --> 00:38:01,070
Let go of me!

537
00:38:04,323 --> 00:38:05,950
Where's your warrant?

538
00:38:06,534 --> 00:38:08,786
A warrant can be issued
within 24 hours of the arrest

539
00:38:08,869 --> 00:38:10,371
since you're a flight risk.

540
00:38:10,454 --> 00:38:11,831
What is the meaning of this?

541
00:38:12,373 --> 00:38:13,457
You?

542
00:38:13,541 --> 00:38:14,709
We meet again.

543
00:38:15,293 --> 00:38:16,711
Just you wait.

544
00:38:16,794 --> 00:38:19,755
I came straight from a funeral
and forgot to bring my other handcuffs.

545
00:38:20,464 --> 00:38:24,218
I'll soon have a tactical unit
drag all of your asses out of here,

546
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:26,470
so don't try to run.
It'll only add to your charges.

547
00:38:27,555 --> 00:38:28,639
Let go of me!

548
00:38:30,516 --> 00:38:31,350
You little…

549
00:38:31,434 --> 00:38:32,435
You know,

550
00:38:32,518 --> 00:38:36,022
no cop is more pissed off
than one who just lost a fellow cop.

551
00:38:36,731 --> 00:38:40,109
Come along quietly
if you don't want to die by my gun.

552
00:38:41,485 --> 00:38:43,487
A cop you sold your drugs to…

553
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:49,201
ended up dead, you bastard.

554
00:38:52,788 --> 00:38:57,251
The homeless network
is more solid than you think.

555
00:38:57,335 --> 00:38:59,337
There's even an emergency contact list.

556
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:01,130
We come together quite well.

557
00:39:01,213 --> 00:39:03,132
I mean, these people do.

558
00:39:03,215 --> 00:39:04,467
With Seoul Station as a hub,

559
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:07,053
the real estate market
on their end is shifting,

560
00:39:07,136 --> 00:39:10,931
showing spikes in Guro, Jongno, Gwanak,
and here in Gwanghwamun.

561
00:39:12,516 --> 00:39:13,684
Real estate market?

562
00:39:14,268 --> 00:39:16,354
What kind of property
do homeless people own?

563
00:39:17,855 --> 00:39:19,857
The minds of homeless people
work differently

564
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:21,359
than those of the non-homeless.

565
00:39:21,442 --> 00:39:23,110
Though nothing is in their names,

566
00:39:23,194 --> 00:39:25,363
they consider public land, forestlands,

567
00:39:25,446 --> 00:39:28,240
and regulated greenbelts as theirs.

568
00:39:28,324 --> 00:39:30,409
Well, we…

569
00:39:31,327 --> 00:39:35,206
they even buy and sell land
in their own metaverse, so to speak.

570
00:39:35,289 --> 00:39:38,334
Even their community has a severe gap
between the rich and the poor.

571
00:39:39,627 --> 00:39:40,461
Wait.

572
00:39:41,837 --> 00:39:43,172
Are you Mr. Jang Hang-seok?

573
00:39:44,006 --> 00:39:45,132
Who are you?

574
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:50,221
There are bank accounts
in Daehan Bank, Donghwa Bank, First Bank,

575
00:39:50,304 --> 00:39:53,265
and Haemaeum Credit Cooperatives
under your name.

576
00:39:53,349 --> 00:39:54,350
Can you explain this?

577
00:39:54,433 --> 00:39:55,726
Are you the police?

578
00:39:56,310 --> 00:39:57,436
-No.
-No.

579
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:59,480
I don't like prisons.

580
00:40:00,147 --> 00:40:01,023
They're too stuffy.

581
00:40:01,107 --> 00:40:02,525
We're not the police, sir.

582
00:40:02,608 --> 00:40:05,694
But we'd appreciate it
if you told us the truth.

583
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:07,279
Please help us out.

584
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:11,742
I think it was about a year ago.

585
00:40:11,826 --> 00:40:14,036
Some random woman came by.

586
00:40:14,703 --> 00:40:19,291
She said she'd pay me
to open four bank accounts in my name,

587
00:40:19,917 --> 00:40:21,210
so I did.

588
00:40:21,293 --> 00:40:22,670
Do you have her phone number?

589
00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:26,340
Do I? Let me see.

590
00:40:30,094 --> 00:40:31,220
Here.

591
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:41,188
I'm Ji Hyun-soo from Seoul Station.

592
00:40:41,856 --> 00:40:42,982
Help us out, will you?

593
00:40:43,732 --> 00:40:44,733
Ji Hyun-soo?

594
00:40:45,776 --> 00:40:47,278
The Cinderella of Seoul Station?

595
00:40:48,279 --> 00:40:50,364
Why didn't you say so earlier?

596
00:40:51,699 --> 00:40:53,617
What does she look like?

597
00:40:54,618 --> 00:40:56,537
She wore red high heels

598
00:40:57,121 --> 00:40:58,789
just like someone in the movies.

599
00:40:58,873 --> 00:41:02,877
Those in red shoes
usually die in movies, don't they?

600
00:41:08,841 --> 00:41:10,342
Please get me the antidote.

601
00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:12,470
It's 50 million won for 10 ml,

602
00:41:12,553 --> 00:41:15,973
and you'll need
at least 20 ml to save her.

603
00:41:16,599 --> 00:41:20,436
How could you sell drugs
to a high school student?

604
00:41:20,519 --> 00:41:21,854
Watch your mouth.

605
00:41:21,937 --> 00:41:23,939
I never sold drugs.

606
00:41:24,607 --> 00:41:26,901
What I sold were weight-loss pills.

607
00:41:26,984 --> 00:41:30,029
Your daughter
just went overboard with them.

608
00:41:32,323 --> 00:41:33,741
You people are unreasonable.

609
00:41:35,451 --> 00:41:36,410
I'm sorry.

610
00:41:36,494 --> 00:41:37,745
I crossed the line.

611
00:41:38,954 --> 00:41:40,122
Please give me the antidote.

612
00:41:40,206 --> 00:41:41,290
Please.

613
00:41:41,373 --> 00:41:43,626
Please let me save my daughter.

614
00:41:43,709 --> 00:41:45,127
Wire the money first.

615
00:41:45,211 --> 00:41:49,215
How could I possibly send
100 million won right away?

616
00:41:50,382 --> 00:41:52,927
I'll get you the money in any way I can,

617
00:41:53,427 --> 00:41:56,138
so please give me the cure first.

618
00:41:56,805 --> 00:41:58,682
Please don't let my daughter die.

619
00:41:59,266 --> 00:42:00,434
Not until

620
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:02,394
I get paid.

621
00:42:03,938 --> 00:42:05,731
Please!

622
00:42:05,814 --> 00:42:07,650
Wait. No!

623
00:42:08,192 --> 00:42:09,985
The person you called is not available…

624
00:42:10,569 --> 00:42:13,072
Why the hell won't she pick up?

625
00:42:13,572 --> 00:42:15,032
Damn it.

626
00:42:17,409 --> 00:42:19,119
-Dad.
-Yes?

627
00:42:19,203 --> 00:42:21,997
Try using Nam-in's phone, not yours.

628
00:42:22,706 --> 00:42:24,458
She'll answer if it's from his number.

629
00:42:25,084 --> 00:42:26,043
Right.

630
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:29,380
But his phone is at the hospital.

631
00:42:29,463 --> 00:42:30,631
I'll call Mom.

632
00:42:31,632 --> 00:42:33,467
His blood urea nitrogen level
has increased.

633
00:42:33,551 --> 00:42:35,761
It could be life-threatening
if we don't take action.

634
00:42:35,844 --> 00:42:39,515
But his blood tested negative for drugs?

635
00:42:39,598 --> 00:42:41,684
That's what the results showed.

636
00:42:43,227 --> 00:42:44,812
How could that be?

637
00:42:57,658 --> 00:42:59,034
Hello? Nam-soon?

638
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:01,078
How did it go?

639
00:43:01,161 --> 00:43:03,831
Did you look into the antidote?

640
00:43:03,914 --> 00:43:06,417
Mom, we did find something,

641
00:43:07,459 --> 00:43:09,461
but we need to make a call
from Nam-in's phone.

642
00:43:09,545 --> 00:43:10,504
All right.

643
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:12,423
Give me the number.

644
00:43:13,299 --> 00:43:14,258
I'll make the call.

645
00:43:14,341 --> 00:43:15,384
Okay.

646
00:43:41,577 --> 00:43:42,411
Hello?

647
00:43:42,494 --> 00:43:43,579
Hairtail was arrested.

648
00:43:44,872 --> 00:43:45,956
Stay off the grid.

649
00:43:46,457 --> 00:43:47,833
Don't do anything.

650
00:43:48,834 --> 00:43:49,918
Don't meet anyone either.

651
00:43:50,002 --> 00:43:51,003
Got it.

652
00:43:56,175 --> 00:43:57,968
YOUNG GANGNAM CAFÉ OWNER

653
00:44:06,101 --> 00:44:09,104
Now over ten million people
are using our services…

654
00:44:11,649 --> 00:44:12,983
Let's continue later.

655
00:44:23,452 --> 00:44:24,870
Hairtail was arrested.

656
00:44:25,621 --> 00:44:26,997
That's not all.

657
00:44:27,623 --> 00:44:29,166
That woman, Hwang Geum-ju…

658
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,294
This deadly new synthetic drug

659
00:44:32,378 --> 00:44:35,255
is known as CTA4885.

660
00:44:35,339 --> 00:44:38,258
Why was it given the name CTA4885?

661
00:44:38,884 --> 00:44:39,843
Then…

662
00:44:41,053 --> 00:44:42,846
the one who stole the jacket was…

663
00:44:45,849 --> 00:44:47,434
And guess who arrested Hairtail.

664
00:44:47,935 --> 00:44:51,271
It was Jamie Choi,
Hwang Geum-ju's plus-one.

665
00:44:51,814 --> 00:44:53,607
That man was a detective!

666
00:44:55,025 --> 00:44:56,026
Hello.

667
00:44:56,527 --> 00:44:59,029
I'm Jamie Choi.

668
00:45:06,578 --> 00:45:08,330
Do you have the dashcam footage?

669
00:45:08,414 --> 00:45:10,916
The video's being enhanced.

670
00:45:10,999 --> 00:45:12,751
It's almost done.

671
00:45:12,835 --> 00:45:15,170
Bring it to me as soon as it's ready.

672
00:45:18,924 --> 00:45:21,009
Hwang Geum-ju is onto Paul.

673
00:45:21,093 --> 00:45:22,010
What now?

674
00:45:23,679 --> 00:45:24,721
Hwang Geum-ju.

675
00:45:26,765 --> 00:45:28,600
I should've made sure she died that day.

676
00:45:29,768 --> 00:45:31,311
I heard she was hospitalized.

677
00:45:31,395 --> 00:45:32,438
Are you sure she's hurt?

678
00:45:34,189 --> 00:45:36,733
If Hairtail talks, we'll be done for.

679
00:45:38,569 --> 00:45:39,653
Madam Kim,

680
00:45:39,736 --> 00:45:41,321
do I seem that mindless to you?

681
00:45:43,991 --> 00:45:45,242
Hairtail has to die.

682
00:45:47,035 --> 00:45:47,911
What?

683
00:45:51,457 --> 00:45:52,833
I was raised

684
00:45:52,916 --> 00:45:56,462
by the world's
most heinous mafia group, Pavel.

685
00:45:57,921 --> 00:45:59,131
Don't you forget it.

686
00:46:04,344 --> 00:46:05,512
That's just how they are.

687
00:46:07,514 --> 00:46:09,308
Even while cutting off someone's limbs,

688
00:46:09,391 --> 00:46:10,851
if they get hungry, they'll ask for bread.

689
00:46:11,602 --> 00:46:12,853
And on that bread,

690
00:46:13,479 --> 00:46:16,565
they'll smear peach jam
their mothers made for them

691
00:46:18,025 --> 00:46:19,651
with tears in their eyes.

692
00:46:21,570 --> 00:46:23,530
Even the cruelest mobsters

693
00:46:26,241 --> 00:46:28,076
must have a soft spot for their mothers.

694
00:46:34,541 --> 00:46:36,752
Although I wouldn't know,
since I don't have one.

695
00:46:47,221 --> 00:46:48,931
Do you know why he's called Hairtail?

696
00:46:50,182 --> 00:46:53,018
His mother raised him by selling hairtail.

697
00:46:53,936 --> 00:46:55,312
That's why he chose that name.

698
00:46:56,396 --> 00:46:57,439
Hairtail…

699
00:46:58,732 --> 00:47:00,150
sure adored his mother.

700
00:47:04,154 --> 00:47:05,155
Have Sun-bae…

701
00:47:07,199 --> 00:47:08,617
pay her a visit.

702
00:47:26,426 --> 00:47:27,970
That bastard has some nerve.

703
00:47:29,388 --> 00:47:30,389
How dare he?

704
00:47:35,852 --> 00:47:38,105
You can't even tell what I'm handing over.

705
00:47:39,356 --> 00:47:41,149
Do you have proof that those are drugs?

706
00:47:42,276 --> 00:47:44,027
We even have a photo of you

707
00:47:45,404 --> 00:47:47,781
giving Baldy the mask.

708
00:47:49,116 --> 00:47:50,617
He died not long after.

709
00:47:52,953 --> 00:47:54,705
There's too much evidence

710
00:47:55,205 --> 00:47:56,748
that I'm not sure

711
00:47:57,374 --> 00:47:59,334
what to use first as leverage.

712
00:48:03,130 --> 00:48:04,631
What do you think is written here?

713
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:09,636
How should I know?

714
00:48:10,429 --> 00:48:11,597
You should.

715
00:48:13,432 --> 00:48:15,392
Everything you did is written on it.

716
00:48:17,311 --> 00:48:19,146
Rules of evidence.

717
00:48:20,314 --> 00:48:21,607
Through his death,

718
00:48:22,149 --> 00:48:25,027
a cop has ensured
that you lot will be judged by the law.

719
00:48:26,862 --> 00:48:28,405
We're just getting started.

720
00:48:30,574 --> 00:48:34,119
Any time you spew any crap
that contradicts this statement,

721
00:48:34,202 --> 00:48:35,037
I mean,

722
00:48:36,830 --> 00:48:39,416
this will and testament,

723
00:48:39,499 --> 00:48:40,792
your sentence will only get heavier.

724
00:48:43,086 --> 00:48:45,047
It'll pile on,
just like the effects of your drugs,

725
00:48:45,130 --> 00:48:46,173
you dirty scumbag.

726
00:49:05,150 --> 00:49:06,234
Nam-in.

727
00:49:06,318 --> 00:49:07,736
Water…

728
00:49:07,819 --> 00:49:09,321
Hang in there a little longer.

729
00:49:10,364 --> 00:49:11,323
Hang in there.

730
00:49:29,758 --> 00:49:31,718
Let's go in. You need to eat.

731
00:49:32,219 --> 00:49:33,845
How could I eat on my own?

732
00:49:33,929 --> 00:49:34,846
Join me.

733
00:49:34,930 --> 00:49:37,557
Us starving won't make Nam-in better.

734
00:49:37,641 --> 00:49:39,142
No, I'm not going to eat.

735
00:49:39,226 --> 00:49:41,061
I'm not like your mom at any rate.

736
00:49:41,561 --> 00:49:43,021
Let's go inside. Come on.

737
00:49:43,105 --> 00:49:44,022
You need a proper meal.

738
00:49:44,106 --> 00:49:45,607
You too, Dad.

739
00:49:54,866 --> 00:49:57,452
Red Heels won't answer.

740
00:49:57,536 --> 00:49:58,745
She's not reading her texts either.

741
00:50:11,508 --> 00:50:12,467
Dad.

742
00:50:13,009 --> 00:50:14,845
I had a dream last night.

743
00:50:15,470 --> 00:50:17,931
Nam-in and I danced the Jalam Khar.

744
00:50:18,515 --> 00:50:20,726
It's a Mongolian dance.
Ppappa was there with us.

745
00:50:21,226 --> 00:50:24,479
My dreams are pretty accurate, Dad.

746
00:50:25,355 --> 00:50:26,440
To tell you the truth,

747
00:50:26,523 --> 00:50:29,234
I also had a dream
the night before I met you and Mom.

748
00:50:30,318 --> 00:50:31,945
Ppappa was in that one as well.

749
00:50:32,028 --> 00:50:34,156
-"Ppappa"?
-Yeah.

750
00:50:34,239 --> 00:50:37,701
It's the horse that led me
to my Mongolian mom.

751
00:50:37,784 --> 00:50:39,745
My friend Ppappa.

752
00:50:39,828 --> 00:50:40,954
When I see Ppappa in my dreams,

753
00:50:41,037 --> 00:50:42,956
only good things happen.

754
00:50:45,167 --> 00:50:48,462
Dad, Nam-in will be all right.

755
00:50:48,545 --> 00:50:49,379
I'm sure of it.

756
00:50:55,302 --> 00:50:57,095
Your mom will never buy the antidote.

757
00:50:57,596 --> 00:51:00,015
She'll ruin everything
by trying to catch the culprit.

758
00:51:00,766 --> 00:51:03,810
She'll choose the greater good
over her own child as always.

759
00:51:03,894 --> 00:51:06,188
She's earned more than enough money,

760
00:51:06,271 --> 00:51:08,607
so now she wants to be
a superhero fighting for justice.

761
00:51:08,690 --> 00:51:11,193
She wants to fly around
and save the world.

762
00:51:11,276 --> 00:51:13,236
That's Hwang Geum-ju for you.

763
00:51:20,702 --> 00:51:22,704
YOUNG GANGNAM CAFÉ OWNER

764
00:51:38,804 --> 00:51:43,099
NEW TEXT MESSAGE

765
00:51:49,356 --> 00:51:50,857
Get me the antidote.

766
00:51:50,941 --> 00:51:52,526
I'll give you as much as you want.

767
00:51:52,609 --> 00:51:54,736
A billion won in cash.

768
00:51:55,904 --> 00:51:59,491
If money is wired to you,
you'll have to share it with your people.

769
00:52:00,116 --> 00:52:02,869
But it can all be yours
if the payment is in cash.

770
00:52:03,537 --> 00:52:06,206
That sounds like
a pretty sweet deal to me.

771
00:52:20,178 --> 00:52:21,304
Where should we meet?

772
00:52:23,598 --> 00:52:26,643
I'll exchange the billion won in cash
for the antidote.

773
00:52:27,269 --> 00:52:29,771
Let's meet at the café
where you first handed over the pill.

774
00:53:11,730 --> 00:53:12,814
Did you get all the money?

775
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:15,942
-Yes.
-Isn't it getting out of hand?

776
00:53:16,026 --> 00:53:17,402
What if you get caught?

777
00:53:17,485 --> 00:53:19,571
It's all black money,

778
00:53:20,530 --> 00:53:22,699
so no one would report me
even if I lost everything.

779
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:25,118
Tell me.

780
00:53:25,660 --> 00:53:26,703
Who the hell are you?

781
00:53:33,168 --> 00:53:35,503
Su-san, I'd like to ask you something.

782
00:53:41,384 --> 00:53:42,636
Do you know this woman?

783
00:53:45,639 --> 00:53:46,973
Of course I do.

784
00:53:48,934 --> 00:53:50,143
I know her very well.

785
00:53:50,226 --> 00:53:51,770
It's Hwang Geum-ju.

786
00:53:51,853 --> 00:53:54,898
She's the apex predator
in the cash business.

787
00:53:56,691 --> 00:53:57,734
Why do you ask?

788
00:53:57,817 --> 00:53:58,944
I…

789
00:54:01,446 --> 00:54:03,073
have a favor to ask.

790
00:54:41,903 --> 00:54:42,821
The antidote.

791
00:54:46,408 --> 00:54:47,617
Place it on the table.

792
00:55:49,429 --> 00:55:51,139
Mix it with water before drinking.

793
00:56:02,984 --> 00:56:03,818
I thought

794
00:56:04,694 --> 00:56:06,654
it was dangerous to drink water.

795
00:56:07,697 --> 00:56:08,573
But this

796
00:56:09,365 --> 00:56:11,242
has to be mixed with water.

797
00:56:37,852 --> 00:56:38,978
Geum-ju…

798
00:56:50,448 --> 00:56:51,658
What is that?

799
00:56:52,784 --> 00:56:55,036
He's Inspector Kang Hee-sik
of the Drug Investigation Unit.

800
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:57,705
The unit's an undercover team
working out of Ganghan Precinct.

801
00:56:57,789 --> 00:56:59,582
The team leader died
while working on the case,

802
00:56:59,666 --> 00:57:01,668
which uncovered the team's covert status.

803
00:57:03,002 --> 00:57:04,546
GEUMJU TV NEWS

804
00:57:04,629 --> 00:57:05,797
…is known as CTA4885.

805
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:07,590
-Mr. Yoon.
-Yes, sir?

806
00:57:07,674 --> 00:57:08,675
The broadcast…

807
00:57:11,511 --> 00:57:12,762
should be stopped.

808
00:57:12,846 --> 00:57:14,556
I've kept my eye on them
for that very reason.

809
00:57:18,768 --> 00:57:19,811
Drink up.

810
00:57:52,886 --> 00:57:53,928
Nam-in.

811
00:58:03,730 --> 00:58:04,731
Mom.

812
00:58:07,275 --> 00:58:08,109
Dad.

813
00:58:10,570 --> 00:58:11,404
Nam-soon.

814
00:58:13,573 --> 00:58:15,033
-Nam-in.
-Nam-in!

815
00:58:21,623 --> 00:58:22,665
Nam-in.

816
00:58:23,917 --> 00:58:25,084
Are you all right?

817
00:58:25,752 --> 00:58:27,670
-Yes.
-I'm…

818
00:58:28,588 --> 00:58:29,839
so sorry.

819
00:58:31,549 --> 00:58:33,259
From now on,

820
00:58:34,135 --> 00:58:35,178
eat whatever you want.

821
00:58:41,559 --> 00:58:42,727
I'm sorry, Mom.

822
00:58:44,354 --> 00:58:46,481
Don't be. I'm the one who's sorry.

823
00:58:48,149 --> 00:58:49,234
You must be hungry.

824
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:51,819
Let's eat.

825
00:58:52,362 --> 00:58:53,571
What do you want to have?

826
00:58:55,823 --> 00:58:56,950
Fried chicken!

827
00:58:57,534 --> 00:58:58,368
Sure.

828
00:58:59,077 --> 00:59:00,203
From this moment on,

829
00:59:00,286 --> 00:59:01,663
don't lose even a single gram.

830
00:59:05,250 --> 00:59:06,125
You did good.

831
00:59:10,588 --> 00:59:12,465
I'm sorry, Mr. Gang.

832
00:59:13,967 --> 00:59:14,968
And…

833
00:59:16,844 --> 00:59:17,762
thank you.

834
00:59:19,889 --> 00:59:21,099
It's nothing.

835
00:59:24,435 --> 00:59:25,478
-Geum-dong?
-Uncle?

836
00:59:26,104 --> 00:59:27,730
-Geum-dong?
-What's with him?

837
00:59:27,814 --> 00:59:31,150
I'm absolutely exhausted.

838
00:59:31,985 --> 00:59:35,113
Dad pees too much.

839
00:59:36,739 --> 00:59:38,074
-Nam-in.
-Nam-in!

840
00:59:45,957 --> 00:59:47,208
How can I help you?

841
00:59:48,167 --> 00:59:50,211
Excuse me, you can't go in there.

842
00:59:50,295 --> 00:59:51,170
Excuse me!

843
00:59:57,844 --> 01:00:01,097
COMMISSIONER GENERAL AN BYEONG-HO

844
01:00:01,889 --> 01:00:03,099
What's this?

845
01:00:03,641 --> 01:00:05,310
This is a warrant request
for Shin Gang-su.

846
01:00:06,019 --> 01:00:08,479
He's the main suspect in the death
of team leader Ha Dong-seok.

847
01:00:08,563 --> 01:00:10,398
But Shin Gang-su…

848
01:00:12,317 --> 01:00:13,985
is backed by Doogo's CEO Ryu Si-o.

849
01:00:14,068 --> 01:00:15,069
What?

850
01:00:15,153 --> 01:00:17,822
I'll also request
a search and seizure warrant for Doogo.

851
01:00:17,905 --> 01:00:19,073
I just…

852
01:00:20,158 --> 01:00:22,118
thought you should know.

853
01:00:22,910 --> 01:00:24,954
If anyone doesn't cooperate
with the investigation,

854
01:00:25,038 --> 01:00:26,539
I'll make them pay.

855
01:00:27,123 --> 01:00:29,083
That includes you, sir.

856
01:01:13,878 --> 01:01:15,088
Si-o, it's me.

857
01:01:18,049 --> 01:01:19,842
I'm sorry I couldn't call you back.

858
01:01:31,604 --> 01:01:32,605
Si-o?

859
01:01:33,189 --> 01:01:36,275
GEUMJU TV NEWS

860
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:01,759
I figured out

861
01:02:02,468 --> 01:02:04,721
what Ryu Si-o's endgame is.

862
01:02:06,222 --> 01:02:08,516
Their ultimate objective

863
01:02:09,142 --> 01:02:10,685
is the antidote.

864
01:02:18,901 --> 01:02:19,902
Hello?

865
01:02:22,363 --> 01:02:23,531
Keep tracking them.

866
01:02:27,827 --> 01:02:30,538
Pavel's Nozh is in Korea.

867
01:02:32,248 --> 01:02:33,291
In Korea?

868
01:02:49,307 --> 01:02:50,266
Hello?

869
01:02:50,892 --> 01:02:52,059
Mr. Shin Gang-su

870
01:02:52,852 --> 01:02:53,728
is dead.

871
01:03:42,068 --> 01:03:44,445
STRONG GIRL NAM-SOON

872
01:03:44,529 --> 01:03:46,239
We've been tracking Pavel for a long time.

873
01:03:46,322 --> 01:03:49,283
They probably have their eyes on you.

874
01:03:49,367 --> 01:03:50,201
Let them.

875
01:03:50,284 --> 01:03:51,577
Why were you having me tailed?

876
01:03:51,661 --> 01:03:54,539
I'll tell you if you date me.

877
01:03:54,622 --> 01:03:55,540
Let's go to the press.

878
01:03:55,623 --> 01:03:57,750
We'll say Doogo is
exporting narcotics in puffer jackets.

879
01:03:57,834 --> 01:03:58,793
Let's give it a try.

880
01:03:58,876 --> 01:04:01,337
Have you lost your mind?
You and I did drugs together?

881
01:04:01,420 --> 01:04:03,464
Be a sharp knife I can wield.
That's how you'll survive.

882
01:04:03,548 --> 01:04:05,842
I had fun delivering the news.

883
01:04:05,925 --> 01:04:07,218
Is everything all right?

884
01:04:07,301 --> 01:04:09,512
Ryu Si-o is coming after my family.

885
01:04:09,595 --> 01:04:11,430
Let's go to my place. Stay with me.

886
01:04:11,514 --> 01:04:12,682
Tell them

887
01:04:12,765 --> 01:04:14,559
that Hwang Geum-ju is alive.

888
01:04:16,769 --> 01:04:21,774
