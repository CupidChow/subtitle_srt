EPISODE 13
SAVE THE SEA HARES

3
00:01:11,404 --> 00:01:13,281
I made a vow after my older brother died…

4
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:18,536
that I would never let someone I love

5
00:01:20,747 --> 00:01:22,248
die on my watch again.

6
00:01:25,418 --> 00:01:27,212
But when I lost my team leader

7
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:30,840
in such an unexpected way…

8
00:01:34,886 --> 00:01:36,596
it broke my heart.

9
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:40,892
"Why did this happen to me again?"

10
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:46,481
It felt like it was my fault.

11
00:01:49,234 --> 00:01:52,153
And I hated myself
for being unable to prevent his death.

12
00:01:59,536 --> 00:02:00,745
It wasn't your fault.

13
00:02:01,496 --> 00:02:05,750
Out of everyone I've met,
you are the sweetest,

14
00:02:06,751 --> 00:02:07,877
most competent,

15
00:02:09,754 --> 00:02:11,422
and greatest police officer I know.

16
00:02:13,508 --> 00:02:14,634
Not to mention,

17
00:02:16,469 --> 00:02:18,513
you're the most amazing guy I know.

18
00:02:27,021 --> 00:02:29,065
I'm glad I have you.

19
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:32,193
You…

20
00:02:33,486 --> 00:02:34,654
mean…

21
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:37,740
a great deal to me.

22
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:40,368
You also

23
00:02:41,119 --> 00:02:42,787
mean…

24
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:45,999
a great deal to me.

25
00:02:49,377 --> 00:02:50,920
I love you.

26
00:02:55,466 --> 00:02:56,426
I love you too.

27
00:03:14,235 --> 00:03:15,778
GEUMJU TV NEWS

28
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:17,322
She isn't picking up.

29
00:03:19,908 --> 00:03:21,784
How many times do we need to call her?

30
00:03:26,331 --> 00:03:27,165
MS. JUNG

31
00:03:27,248 --> 00:03:29,459
I SUDDENLY DON'T FEEL WELL
AND WON'T BE ABLE TO HOST TODAY

32
00:03:30,668 --> 00:03:31,628
That's sudden.

33
00:03:33,254 --> 00:03:35,256
Mr. Kim, you'll present the news alone.

34
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:37,050
Let's begin.

35
00:03:44,432 --> 00:03:45,892
Is everything all right?

36
00:03:46,392 --> 00:03:50,146
IT'S NO BIG DEAL,
IT MUST'VE BEEN SOMETHING I ATE

37
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:51,231
CEO HWANG GEUM-JU

38
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:44,242
Hey, Nam-soon.

39
00:04:44,325 --> 00:04:46,119
Mom, are you done shooting?

40
00:04:46,202 --> 00:04:47,787
We just wrapped up.

41
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:50,790
Once it's edited,
I'll send the final version to you

42
00:04:50,873 --> 00:04:52,750
and Inspector Kang as well.

43
00:04:52,834 --> 00:04:54,377
Mom…

44
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:56,796
Don't send it in the middle of the night.

45
00:04:57,338 --> 00:04:58,798
He's exhausted,

46
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:01,217
and I don't want to interrupt his sleep.

47
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:02,510
Sure.

48
00:05:02,593 --> 00:05:04,053
I'll let him sleep…

49
00:05:05,346 --> 00:05:06,180
Sleep?

50
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:08,850
He's next to you and exhausted?

51
00:05:11,602 --> 00:05:12,562
My daughter,

52
00:05:13,354 --> 00:05:14,397
you did it.

53
00:05:16,274 --> 00:05:18,359
Mom, what are you talking about?

54
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:20,737
It's not like that.

55
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:21,988
It's not?

56
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:24,490
Are you saying nothing's happening?

57
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:26,117
Whatever.

58
00:05:28,119 --> 00:05:29,662
You're embarrassing me, Mom.

59
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:31,247
All right, fine.

60
00:05:32,206 --> 00:05:33,249
Anyway,

61
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:37,295
I hope your stay with him
will be fruitful.

62
00:05:37,378 --> 00:05:39,422
I have high expectations,

63
00:05:39,922 --> 00:05:42,050
so don't you let me down, my dear.

64
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:44,343
Stop it.

65
00:05:44,427 --> 00:05:46,929
The night is very long.

66
00:05:48,222 --> 00:05:50,475
I'll take it that you catch my drift.

67
00:05:50,558 --> 00:05:51,559
Then…

68
00:06:05,073 --> 00:06:08,493
He's handsome even with his eyes closed.

69
00:06:54,789 --> 00:06:56,457
IT'S A DRUG TESTING KIT

70
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:10,471
Hello?

71
00:07:10,555 --> 00:07:12,682
It'll be wise to take the test fast.

72
00:07:12,765 --> 00:07:13,683
You…

73
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,144
have been drugged.

74
00:07:16,727 --> 00:07:18,771
It wasn't CTA4885 though.

75
00:07:22,817 --> 00:07:25,403
You'd better follow my orders.

76
00:07:32,034 --> 00:07:34,537
The new psychoactive substance, CTA4885,

77
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:38,291
has been discovered
at the logistics company Doogo.

78
00:07:38,374 --> 00:07:39,792
Ryu Si-o, the CEO of Doogo,

79
00:07:39,876 --> 00:07:41,752
formed close ties
with those in politics and finance

80
00:07:41,836 --> 00:07:44,797
such as Director Jung Dae-cheol
of TBO Network,

81
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:46,966
Hwang Tae-jun, presiding judge
of the Seoul Western District Court,

82
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:49,177
Commissioner General An Byeong-ho,

83
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:52,430
as well as
Deputy Chief Prosecutor Moon Seong-u

84
00:07:52,513 --> 00:07:55,099
to secure the distribution chain.

85
00:07:55,183 --> 00:07:58,519
Such a networkaided him
in the expansion of his drug business.

86
00:07:58,603 --> 00:08:00,438
The drug CTA4885

87
00:08:00,521 --> 00:08:02,565
that Doogo's CEO Ryu Si-o
went to such lengths

88
00:08:02,648 --> 00:08:04,275
to keep hidden in plain sight

89
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:05,818
is this

90
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:08,070
right here.

91
00:08:11,282 --> 00:08:15,244
To the naked eye, it looks like
the filling of a puffer jacket.

92
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:19,165
However, take a look at what happens
when I pour water on it.

93
00:08:28,216 --> 00:08:29,509
CTA4885 DISGUISED AS PUFFER JACKET FILLING

94
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:30,676
It becomes a drug.

95
00:08:41,145 --> 00:08:42,730
Get me the PR and legal teams.

96
00:08:43,481 --> 00:08:44,899
We need to respond with legal action.

97
00:08:44,982 --> 00:08:46,108
Yes, sir.

98
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:48,110
Paint it as sensationalist fake news.

99
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:49,028
Spin it into something

100
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:51,405
that nobody would believe.

101
00:08:51,489 --> 00:08:52,532
Yes, sir.

102
00:08:56,285 --> 00:08:59,830
And find all articles related to Doogo.

103
00:08:59,914 --> 00:09:00,790
Of course.

104
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:02,416
Wait.

105
00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:05,711
You know the warehouse part-timer
who passed away a while ago?

106
00:09:06,295 --> 00:09:07,296
The late Hong Jeong-ho?

107
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,298
Meet with his family.

108
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:11,384
I don't want someone
having leverage over us.

109
00:09:11,467 --> 00:09:14,720
It wouldn't be a bad idea
to give them some condolence money.

110
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:15,680
Yes, sir.

111
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:43,082
Hillary, things are a mess at the office.

112
00:09:43,165 --> 00:09:44,250
Some media outlet reported

113
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:47,378
that our exported puffer jackets
have drugs in them.

114
00:09:47,461 --> 00:09:49,213
It's blowing up online!

115
00:09:50,172 --> 00:09:51,716
Nice.

116
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:53,384
It's going as planned.

117
00:09:54,552 --> 00:09:56,762
SUPER STRENGTH AND SEVERE THIRST
NEW DRUG CTA4885

118
00:09:56,846 --> 00:09:59,140
GEUMJU TV

119
00:09:59,223 --> 00:10:00,725
I'M A FORMER EMPLOYEE OF HERITAGE…

120
00:10:00,808 --> 00:10:01,851
No way.

121
00:10:01,934 --> 00:10:04,103
…I HEARD MANY OF THE MEMBERS
CAME TO THE CLUB TO DO DRUGS

122
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:36,886
Life is tough, right?

123
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:39,221
Hang in there.

124
00:10:42,558 --> 00:10:45,811
The police will patrol soon,
so find a place to sleep indoors.

125
00:10:49,982 --> 00:10:51,192
Your face will freeze off.

126
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:54,111
You…

127
00:10:54,195 --> 00:10:55,112
Thank you!

128
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:57,865
Stay hopeful.

129
00:10:58,366 --> 00:10:59,992
Anything can happen in life.

130
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,293
You little punk!

131
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:13,714
Are you kidding me?

132
00:11:13,798 --> 00:11:16,509
You took a puffer jacket
that was obtained without a warrant

133
00:11:16,592 --> 00:11:19,261
and handed it to some
pirate news station of all places!

134
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:22,431
And you call yourself a cop?
Are you out of your mind?

135
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:24,517
You of all people know

136
00:11:25,434 --> 00:11:27,186
that it speaks the truth.

137
00:11:27,269 --> 00:11:30,648
Request a correction notice
from Geumju TV or whatever it's called!

138
00:11:30,731 --> 00:11:33,484
Are you furious with me

139
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:37,488
because I crossed the line
as a police officer

140
00:11:37,571 --> 00:11:40,908
or because I did my job too damn well?

141
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:43,786
Why the hell…

142
00:11:44,912 --> 00:11:48,416
are you going down a slippery slope
with a drug dealer?

143
00:11:50,709 --> 00:11:51,544
You.

144
00:11:51,627 --> 00:11:55,923
Do you think such insubordination
will go unpunished?

145
00:11:58,801 --> 00:11:59,635
Sir,

146
00:12:00,761 --> 00:12:02,680
speaking as your fellow alumnus,

147
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:06,100
do you know how many of your juniors
looked up to you

148
00:12:06,183 --> 00:12:08,018
and dreamed of becoming like you?

149
00:12:09,478 --> 00:12:11,730
I was one of them.

150
00:12:14,692 --> 00:12:17,111
Go ahead and take
disciplinary action against me.

151
00:12:17,194 --> 00:12:18,279
But I…

152
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:21,490
will get to the bottom of this case

153
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:23,325
no matter what.

154
00:12:24,952 --> 00:12:25,786
Also,

155
00:12:26,287 --> 00:12:28,247
if I have to quit, I'll do it myself.

156
00:12:47,558 --> 00:12:48,684
Come with me, Tsetseg.

157
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:50,811
-Where?
-I have to meet some people.

158
00:12:52,146 --> 00:12:54,523
Those who straddle the line
between friend and foe.

159
00:12:56,525 --> 00:12:58,444
I'd rather stay back.

160
00:12:58,527 --> 00:13:00,946
The team has a lot on their plate today

161
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:03,199
-including writing an official response.
-All right then.

162
00:13:09,747 --> 00:13:11,207
You bastards.

163
00:13:12,082 --> 00:13:16,170
We have been caught in Ryu Si-o's trap.

164
00:13:16,253 --> 00:13:17,588
According to Geumju TV,

165
00:13:17,671 --> 00:13:21,383
Doogo directly manufactured
and distributed the drugs.

166
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:24,470
-Is that true?
-Yes, I think so.

167
00:13:24,553 --> 00:13:27,014
I think a Russian mafia group is involved.

168
00:13:28,432 --> 00:13:29,517
Then…

169
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,894
what can we do about this?

170
00:13:43,739 --> 00:13:45,199
We must set the record straight.

171
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:49,995
Mr. Jung,

172
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:51,413
provide countermeasures.

173
00:13:52,748 --> 00:13:56,794
"A private news channel planting delusions
in its viewers during a rough time."

174
00:13:58,796 --> 00:14:00,464
Release a press kit with that angle.

175
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:02,550
I'll take care of the rest.

176
00:14:05,886 --> 00:14:06,887
Mr. Ryu,

177
00:14:07,429 --> 00:14:08,639
is it true though?

178
00:14:09,306 --> 00:14:10,516
Were those drugs?

179
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:12,393
That no longer matters now.

180
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:15,104
Whether you live or die

181
00:14:15,771 --> 00:14:17,106
is the issue at hand.

182
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:19,692
I'm sure you saw the news,

183
00:14:19,775 --> 00:14:21,735
but our conversations were wiretapped.

184
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:26,031
So they all know who you are
and of your involvement.

185
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:32,371
They also have you
receiving bribes on tape.

186
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:35,207
Prosecutor Moon,

187
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:38,878
dig up dirt on Hwang Geum-ju.

188
00:14:39,461 --> 00:14:41,130
I'm sure you'll find something.

189
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:45,634
Hwang Geum-ju has a daughter.

190
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:47,678
Her name is Gang Nam-soon.

191
00:14:47,761 --> 00:14:49,930
She lost her in Mongolia
and then found her.

192
00:14:50,514 --> 00:14:52,433
Her story was covered,

193
00:14:52,933 --> 00:14:55,978
but the links to
all of those news articles are now gone.

194
00:14:57,438 --> 00:15:01,609
I'm sure your network has relevant files
and materials in the archive.

195
00:15:02,359 --> 00:15:04,737
Dig up any information on that daughter.

196
00:15:07,781 --> 00:15:08,908
The strong girl

197
00:15:10,618 --> 00:15:11,744
Gang Nam-soon.

198
00:15:33,307 --> 00:15:34,433
Mom,

199
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:36,518
it's Tsetseg.

200
00:15:37,728 --> 00:15:38,979
Have you been well?

201
00:15:40,731 --> 00:15:42,107
Mom.

202
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:44,777
Dad.

203
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:47,154
I miss you.

204
00:15:50,991 --> 00:15:53,994
Mom, Dad.

205
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:57,581
I'm doing well.

206
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:06,048
Mom…

207
00:16:06,131 --> 00:16:07,174
-Mr. Kwon.
-Yes?

208
00:16:07,257 --> 00:16:09,343
"All puffer jackets
are inspected in advance."

209
00:16:09,426 --> 00:16:11,011
"The drug allegations are preposterous."

210
00:16:11,095 --> 00:16:12,513
-Add that to the statement.
-Yes, sir.

211
00:16:12,596 --> 00:16:14,974
And the camera?
Come here and film Ms. Baek working.

212
00:16:15,057 --> 00:16:17,226
-All right.
-Will my face be shown?

213
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:18,227
That's right.

214
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:20,396
Don't be nervous and be yourself, okay?

215
00:16:21,021 --> 00:16:22,022
Also,

216
00:16:22,106 --> 00:16:25,776
take photos in a way
that makes us look natural.

217
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:27,861
Relax, everyone.

218
00:16:27,945 --> 00:16:29,363
Ready? Action!

219
00:16:35,953 --> 00:16:37,454
-Hillary.
-Yes?

220
00:16:37,538 --> 00:16:38,747
What are you doing?

221
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:40,499
Ms. Baby Face,

222
00:16:40,582 --> 00:16:42,209
can you spare me a flash drive?

223
00:16:46,422 --> 00:16:48,465
Thanks, Ms. Baby Face.

224
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:56,140
You got it, right?

225
00:16:56,223 --> 00:16:57,057
Let's change it up.

226
00:16:57,141 --> 00:16:58,434
Take photos on this side.

227
00:16:58,517 --> 00:17:00,310
Move the camera further inside.

228
00:17:08,902 --> 00:17:11,905
Point the camera this way.

229
00:17:11,989 --> 00:17:13,907
All right, here we go.

230
00:17:13,991 --> 00:17:14,950
Cue.

231
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:24,668
COPYING FILE

232
00:17:31,175 --> 00:17:32,092
Hey.

233
00:17:32,634 --> 00:17:34,011
Hey, where are you off to?

234
00:17:34,094 --> 00:17:35,345
Where are you going?

235
00:17:35,429 --> 00:17:36,472
Why you…

236
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:47,858
Mr. Ryu has arrived.

237
00:18:25,729 --> 00:18:27,731
Hi, Si-o. How did it go?

238
00:18:28,357 --> 00:18:29,525
I was waiting for you.

239
00:18:39,868 --> 00:18:41,120
BEOM

240
00:18:52,881 --> 00:18:54,716
All right. I'll be there.

241
00:19:03,433 --> 00:19:04,434
Tsetseg.

242
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:10,691
I'm going to put all my trust in you.

243
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:13,485
Can I…

244
00:19:14,736 --> 00:19:16,196
fully trust you?

245
00:19:18,615 --> 00:19:20,075
You can trust me, Si-o.

246
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:25,122
You were curious about the lab, right?

247
00:19:26,206 --> 00:19:27,791
Come on. I'll give you a tour.

248
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:29,168
All right.

249
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:31,879
Wait for me downstairs.

250
00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:47,561
Gan I-sik, I'm sending you a package.

251
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:52,024
Yes.

252
00:19:52,107 --> 00:19:54,776
I copied everything on his secret phone.

253
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:57,029
But everything's in Russian.

254
00:19:57,738 --> 00:19:59,239
They must be texts
he exchanged with Pavel.

255
00:20:00,407 --> 00:20:02,409
There are also recordings.

256
00:20:02,951 --> 00:20:04,661
I'll send it your way,
so have it analyzed.

257
00:20:05,329 --> 00:20:07,956
I'll be heading to Doogo's research lab.

258
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,374
Okay. Bye.

259
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:25,224
They've all gathered.

260
00:20:25,307 --> 00:20:27,017
I should head over there myself.

261
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:29,394
They all speak different languages
and need a translator.

262
00:20:30,437 --> 00:20:31,563
Take Kyle with you.

263
00:20:31,647 --> 00:20:32,856
I have Tsetseg by my side.

264
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:33,899
Yes, sir.

265
00:20:34,816 --> 00:20:35,943
Si-o!

266
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:44,785
-Have a good one.
-Thanks.

267
00:21:03,553 --> 00:21:04,680
Are there any local numbers?

268
00:21:04,763 --> 00:21:06,515
No, there aren't. Hold on.

269
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:15,357
Hang on.

270
00:21:16,483 --> 00:21:17,651
That's not it.

271
00:21:36,795 --> 00:21:37,921
The grandmother.

272
00:21:40,424 --> 00:21:41,508
Her son.

273
00:21:42,759 --> 00:21:43,885
Her ex-husband.

274
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:49,975
Do I have to choose one?

275
00:21:50,058 --> 00:21:51,393
One at a time.

276
00:21:54,062 --> 00:21:55,564
Take them to the brink of death.

277
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:08,869
Start with the easiest one.

278
00:22:11,913 --> 00:22:13,248
We'll start with her.

279
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:21,590
Hee-sik.

280
00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:24,551
010-0737-2221.

281
00:22:24,634 --> 00:22:26,553
This is the only local number.

282
00:22:26,636 --> 00:22:28,430
The others are phone numbers in Russia.

283
00:22:30,223 --> 00:22:31,516
He called that number a lot too.

284
00:22:35,437 --> 00:22:36,813
This is Kang Hee-sik of the DIU.

285
00:22:37,314 --> 00:22:38,982
I'm sending you a phone number.

286
00:22:39,066 --> 00:22:41,485
Please get me an ID
and their immigration records.

287
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:42,986
Thanks.

288
00:22:57,626 --> 00:22:59,961
The phone's owner is
a woman who flew in from Russia

289
00:23:00,045 --> 00:23:01,088
in August 2021.

290
00:23:07,761 --> 00:23:09,930
MS. HWANG GEUM-JU

291
00:23:15,977 --> 00:23:17,854
I have one of Ryu Si-o's bosses.

292
00:23:17,938 --> 00:23:20,440
Nam-soon went to
Doogo's research lab to meet her.

293
00:24:12,701 --> 00:24:13,618
It's been a while.

294
00:24:17,789 --> 00:24:19,875
Hi, I'm Hillary.

295
00:24:23,545 --> 00:24:24,880
She has a unique background,

296
00:24:26,256 --> 00:24:28,466
so please don't mind her casual language.

297
00:24:30,093 --> 00:24:31,887
I'll step outside

298
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:33,722
and let you two talk, Si-o.

299
00:24:33,805 --> 00:24:34,931
No, you can stay.

300
00:24:35,891 --> 00:24:36,725
It's all right.

301
00:24:36,808 --> 00:24:40,395
Actually, I was hoping
to use the restroom.

302
00:24:52,657 --> 00:24:53,533
Who is she to you

303
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:56,369
that you brought her here?

304
00:24:57,078 --> 00:24:58,288
She's one of my people.

305
00:24:58,371 --> 00:25:01,166
One of your people?

306
00:25:13,637 --> 00:25:16,514
The next broadcast
will be about the attempt on my life,

307
00:25:16,598 --> 00:25:18,308
the death of Hairtail,

308
00:25:18,391 --> 00:25:21,269
and Madam Kim
attacking me at the hospital.

309
00:25:21,353 --> 00:25:24,481
The viewers have been eating up
what we have to say.

310
00:25:26,024 --> 00:25:28,944
Inspector Kang, just get me what you have

311
00:25:29,027 --> 00:25:31,363
on how Hairtail's killer
faked the ID of a lawyer.

312
00:25:31,446 --> 00:25:33,365
But you were hit with a broadcasting ban.

313
00:25:33,865 --> 00:25:34,991
Are you sure about this?

314
00:25:35,075 --> 00:25:38,703
I'm already facing all sorts of reprimands
and legal restrictions.

315
00:25:39,329 --> 00:25:41,289
We're barred from airing our show.

316
00:25:42,290 --> 00:25:44,376
But outlaws should be handled
outside the law,

317
00:25:45,085 --> 00:25:48,171
and crime should be fought with crime.

318
00:25:48,255 --> 00:25:50,465
I have information
on Doogo's research lab.

319
00:25:51,967 --> 00:25:54,135
As the distributor said,
sea hares are there.

320
00:25:54,219 --> 00:25:56,346
They bring them in from Busan Port.

321
00:25:56,429 --> 00:25:58,598
I believe they're being imported
from the Philippines.

322
00:25:58,682 --> 00:26:00,267
Payments are made
through the Bank of the Philippines.

323
00:27:35,195 --> 00:27:36,404
Sea hare blood.

324
00:27:37,364 --> 00:27:39,074
It's used to make the antidote.

325
00:27:39,157 --> 00:27:41,034
Pavel only sold the drugs.

326
00:27:42,118 --> 00:27:43,828
I'm the one who researched sea hares.

327
00:27:46,122 --> 00:27:47,374
The antidote business

328
00:27:48,958 --> 00:27:50,168
belongs to me.

329
00:27:51,544 --> 00:27:53,088
That could lead

330
00:27:54,172 --> 00:27:56,132
to your demise.

331
00:28:04,349 --> 00:28:05,558
I don't want that.

332
00:28:08,603 --> 00:28:09,771
So what should I do?

333
00:28:16,653 --> 00:28:17,987
Should I follow your example?

334
00:28:21,658 --> 00:28:23,618
If I offered an eye as an apology…

335
00:28:27,664 --> 00:28:29,124
perhaps they would forgive me.

336
00:28:43,471 --> 00:28:44,431
Binbin.

337
00:28:46,599 --> 00:28:47,892
You know where he is, right?

338
00:28:54,649 --> 00:28:55,650
Is he alive at least?

339
00:28:57,944 --> 00:28:59,028
In your case,

340
00:29:00,697 --> 00:29:02,866
it won't end with just one eye.

341
00:29:05,034 --> 00:29:06,035
Maybe.

342
00:29:12,709 --> 00:29:14,878
But I currently have both eyes,

343
00:29:16,504 --> 00:29:18,089
so I have a wide field of view.

344
00:29:24,012 --> 00:29:25,054
No one…

345
00:29:27,015 --> 00:29:28,600
can tell me what to do.

346
00:29:30,143 --> 00:29:33,480
Hwang Geum-ju has Opulentia on her side.

347
00:29:38,526 --> 00:29:41,863
Take all the drugs you want.

348
00:29:42,989 --> 00:29:46,159
You still won't be able to
achieve anything on your own.

349
00:29:52,081 --> 00:29:53,208
I have the power…

350
00:29:56,044 --> 00:29:57,670
to do as I please,

351
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:01,508
whatever that may be.

352
00:30:02,383 --> 00:30:04,886
The drug controls the human brain.

353
00:30:05,428 --> 00:30:08,932
It stimulates your hormones
to realize your deepest desires

354
00:30:09,015 --> 00:30:10,475
and drives your body to the extreme,

355
00:30:11,476 --> 00:30:12,727
though it'll lead to death.

356
00:30:14,562 --> 00:30:16,189
Without your help,

357
00:30:16,272 --> 00:30:17,941
we would've gotten nowhere.

358
00:30:18,775 --> 00:30:20,401
The law is powerless

359
00:30:21,236 --> 00:30:23,154
when evil forces combine their strength.

360
00:30:23,238 --> 00:30:25,073
I hardly did much.

361
00:30:26,616 --> 00:30:29,244
First, let's track
how the sea hare is imported.

362
00:30:29,327 --> 00:30:32,747
Try to find out when the next shipment
will arrive in Busan Port.

363
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:35,041
There wasn't any information
on his secret phone.

364
00:30:35,625 --> 00:30:39,128
Ryu Si-o hasn't been
sharing that with Pavel.

365
00:30:40,296 --> 00:30:42,090
He's been keeping it to himself?

366
00:30:51,307 --> 00:30:52,976
Jun-hee.

367
00:30:54,894 --> 00:30:58,481
Mr. Gang won't be at the café
for the time being.

368
00:30:58,565 --> 00:30:59,899
He's been grounded for his safety.

369
00:30:59,983 --> 00:31:03,820
Geum-ju takes after her father
and does the craziest things.

370
00:31:03,903 --> 00:31:07,115
She bought a broadcasting station
to present the strangest news.

371
00:31:07,198 --> 00:31:08,741
Does she think she's a spy?

372
00:31:08,825 --> 00:31:10,910
Who is she, James Bond?

373
00:31:10,994 --> 00:31:12,954
This whole project has me baffled.

374
00:31:13,037 --> 00:31:13,997
Unbelievable.

375
00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:17,458
Daughters take after their fathers.

376
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:19,127
My daughter takes after me too.

377
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:20,879
That's why she's innocent and sweet.

378
00:31:22,505 --> 00:31:24,841
I can't believe you said that
with your own mouth.

379
00:31:24,924 --> 00:31:26,050
You cheeky thing.

380
00:31:26,718 --> 00:31:28,887
But I must say it's the truth.

381
00:31:37,145 --> 00:31:39,397
What's with that heated gaze?

382
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:42,483
It could melt my face.

383
00:31:43,443 --> 00:31:45,361
Your name may mean "in the middle,"

384
00:31:45,445 --> 00:31:47,572
but there's nothing moderate about you,

385
00:31:48,156 --> 00:31:49,407
my dear Joong-gan.

386
00:31:52,952 --> 00:31:53,870
What is it,

387
00:31:53,953 --> 00:31:55,413
my Jun-hee?

388
00:31:56,331 --> 00:31:57,540
I don't think

389
00:31:58,041 --> 00:32:01,085
I'll be able to take you home today.

390
00:32:01,169 --> 00:32:02,378
Why not?

391
00:32:02,462 --> 00:32:07,342
There's something important
I must do today.

392
00:32:07,425 --> 00:32:08,468
And what would that be?

393
00:32:08,551 --> 00:32:10,261
I'll tell you some other time.

394
00:32:10,345 --> 00:32:11,888
So I should go home alone?

395
00:32:14,182 --> 00:32:17,894
But it's too scary to go alone.

396
00:32:17,977 --> 00:32:19,145
I must say

397
00:32:19,228 --> 00:32:21,189
it does worry me too.

398
00:32:21,731 --> 00:32:23,399
You're like a kid by the water.

399
00:32:24,067 --> 00:32:25,318
Don't stop by anywhere else

400
00:32:25,944 --> 00:32:28,279
and go straight home, got it?

401
00:32:29,113 --> 00:32:30,031
Got it.

402
00:32:31,282 --> 00:32:32,492
I'm scared.

403
00:32:56,391 --> 00:32:57,225
I…

404
00:32:58,643 --> 00:33:00,561
have shown you everything.

405
00:33:03,606 --> 00:33:04,649
By the way,

406
00:33:05,274 --> 00:33:06,567
who was that woman?

407
00:33:08,403 --> 00:33:09,612
Someone who monitors me.

408
00:33:10,238 --> 00:33:11,406
Why is she doing that?

409
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:13,241
Because I'm not trusted.

410
00:33:16,202 --> 00:33:17,912
The lab you saw today…

411
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:20,498
is my dream

412
00:33:21,082 --> 00:33:22,709
and what I'm betting my life on.

413
00:33:24,335 --> 00:33:26,879
It opened up the chance for me
to rise above them.

414
00:33:28,715 --> 00:33:31,384
Who do you mean by "them"?

415
00:33:31,968 --> 00:33:32,969
Very…

416
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:35,930
bad people.

417
00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:37,223
Bad as in how?

418
00:33:37,306 --> 00:33:38,599
Like the mafia or something?

419
00:33:38,683 --> 00:33:39,767
That's right.

420
00:33:39,851 --> 00:33:41,019
What?

421
00:33:43,646 --> 00:33:44,564
Good night.

422
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:47,734
Okay. Bye.

423
00:34:05,001 --> 00:34:06,002
Go.

424
00:34:06,586 --> 00:34:07,420
Shoo.

425
00:34:23,186 --> 00:34:24,187
You dirtbag.

426
00:34:32,737 --> 00:34:34,447
-Hello?
-Did he drop you off?

427
00:34:34,530 --> 00:34:36,574
Yeah, I know you were watching.

428
00:34:36,657 --> 00:34:39,077
The sea hare that you got on video today.

429
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:41,037
We need to know
when the next batch will be imported.

430
00:34:41,621 --> 00:34:42,580
It arrives through Busan.

431
00:34:42,663 --> 00:34:44,332
How am I supposed to find that out?

432
00:34:46,209 --> 00:34:47,668
I'll get right on it. Bye.

433
00:34:58,387 --> 00:34:59,263
Hello?

434
00:34:59,347 --> 00:35:01,390
Where are you, Ms. Baby Face?

435
00:35:01,474 --> 00:35:02,975
What do you think?
I'm still at the office.

436
00:35:03,059 --> 00:35:04,644
Things are crazy.

437
00:35:04,727 --> 00:35:07,897
The company has never been
in such chaos before.

438
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:10,149
Where on earth are you anyway?

439
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:14,946
I was just about to head in
and lend you a hand.

440
00:35:15,029 --> 00:35:16,072
I'll be right there.

441
00:35:16,155 --> 00:35:17,949
What can I get you? Dumplings?

442
00:35:45,726 --> 00:35:46,811
Hello?

443
00:35:46,894 --> 00:35:47,728
It's Ryu Si-o.

444
00:35:49,939 --> 00:35:51,774
You weren't drugged with CTA4885.

445
00:35:52,316 --> 00:35:54,318
What you inhaled was an aerosolized drug.

446
00:35:55,111 --> 00:35:56,988
One that shows up on a hair strand test.

447
00:35:57,697 --> 00:35:58,698
And you…

448
00:36:00,283 --> 00:36:02,493
left behind many strands of hair
in the taxi.

449
00:36:03,911 --> 00:36:06,330
Your younger sister
is studying in Shanghai.

450
00:36:06,956 --> 00:36:08,708
I'm sure you know that moving drugs

451
00:36:09,375 --> 00:36:10,751
is a capital crime in China.

452
00:36:13,212 --> 00:36:16,716
Your sister will soon
receive a batch as well.

453
00:36:19,802 --> 00:36:20,887
I'm sure

454
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:23,014
you want to save her.

455
00:36:25,141 --> 00:36:27,435
Go live as soon as
you get to work tomorrow.

456
00:36:27,935 --> 00:36:30,563
Say that you delivered lies

457
00:36:31,522 --> 00:36:32,857
under Hwang Geum-ju's orders.

458
00:36:33,482 --> 00:36:35,902
Say you're coming clean because
you couldn't deceive the public anymore.

459
00:36:36,485 --> 00:36:37,653
Otherwise,

460
00:36:38,362 --> 00:36:41,699
the Chinese government will execute
your sister on drug charges.

461
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:44,035
No…

462
00:36:51,709 --> 00:36:52,710
Yun-jeong.

463
00:36:57,506 --> 00:36:59,175
Please pick up.

464
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:03,387
MISSED CALLS
DIRECTOR JUNG DAE-CHEOL

465
00:37:04,722 --> 00:37:05,973
I see you called, Mr. Jung.

466
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:09,560
It's about Ms. Hwang's daughter.

467
00:37:09,644 --> 00:37:12,480
The brawl at the Han River ger
was covered by reporters,

468
00:37:13,606 --> 00:37:17,068
but it never made the news
due to a gag order.

469
00:37:17,151 --> 00:37:18,945
There must be related footage.

470
00:37:19,028 --> 00:37:21,614
The employee
managing the archive resigned,

471
00:37:22,990 --> 00:37:24,075
but I reached out.

472
00:37:24,158 --> 00:37:25,451
Find her no matter what.

473
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,286
Find that woman's daughter.

474
00:37:28,246 --> 00:37:29,747
Find Gang Nam-soon.

475
00:37:42,593 --> 00:37:45,429
There's a young man in Gangnam
who owns a tarot café.

476
00:37:46,013 --> 00:37:47,473
His mom paid that money.

477
00:37:48,015 --> 00:37:50,434
The fact she could pay
a billion won in cash

478
00:37:50,518 --> 00:37:51,978
tells me she's loaded.

479
00:37:52,061 --> 00:37:53,187
She paid a billion won

480
00:37:53,896 --> 00:37:55,231
for the antidote?

481
00:37:55,314 --> 00:37:57,525
She offered such a large amount in cash…

482
00:37:59,944 --> 00:38:01,445
that I lost my mind for a second.

483
00:38:02,405 --> 00:38:04,824
You took me in
when I had nothing going for me.

484
00:38:04,907 --> 00:38:06,909
What I did wasn't right.

485
00:38:06,993 --> 00:38:08,786
So I came to my senses and came back.

486
00:38:08,869 --> 00:38:10,997
I'm sorry. It won't happen again.

487
00:38:18,546 --> 00:38:19,422
Marie,

488
00:38:19,505 --> 00:38:22,550
you said that Hairtail was arrested.

489
00:38:24,802 --> 00:38:26,178
Will we be all right?

490
00:38:26,262 --> 00:38:27,888
We'll have to shut down the club.

491
00:38:27,972 --> 00:38:30,057
-Why?
-Hairtail…

492
00:38:31,142 --> 00:38:32,393
is dead.

493
00:38:35,271 --> 00:38:37,565
I can't believe there's only one left.

494
00:38:42,903 --> 00:38:44,322
Unbelievable.

495
00:38:44,405 --> 00:38:46,657
When did you read my mind?

496
00:38:49,535 --> 00:38:50,494
Ta-da.

497
00:38:52,038 --> 00:38:54,915
How did you know I liked this?

498
00:38:58,627 --> 00:39:02,214
I have loads of work to do,
but I don't have the energy for it.

499
00:39:02,298 --> 00:39:04,925
Girl, I can't even take
a coffee break when I want to.

500
00:39:07,386 --> 00:39:09,263
All right, Ms. Baby Face.

501
00:39:13,893 --> 00:39:15,644
It's nice and sweet.

502
00:39:19,648 --> 00:39:21,233
-Ms. Baby Face.
-Yes?

503
00:39:21,317 --> 00:39:24,779
If controversies and a bad rap
continue to follow the company,

504
00:39:24,862 --> 00:39:26,822
won't our trade business also flop?

505
00:39:26,906 --> 00:39:29,992
I don't know about domestic sales,
but overseas trade will be fine.

506
00:39:30,701 --> 00:39:31,911
Are you worried you'll get fired?

507
00:39:32,495 --> 00:39:33,621
Don't worry.

508
00:39:33,704 --> 00:39:35,664
This team will never downsize.

509
00:39:35,748 --> 00:39:37,792
I really don't want to get fired.

510
00:39:39,335 --> 00:39:42,046
By the way,
which countries do we import goods from?

511
00:39:42,129 --> 00:39:43,631
The Philippines and Taiwan.

512
00:39:43,714 --> 00:39:44,882
-What are the items?
-Sea hares.

513
00:39:44,965 --> 00:39:46,092
Why would anyone want those?

514
00:39:46,759 --> 00:39:48,010
Why would I care?

515
00:39:51,597 --> 00:39:54,141
Hillary, here you go.

516
00:40:01,315 --> 00:40:03,526
I hear they come through Busan Port.
When, exactly?

517
00:40:03,609 --> 00:40:04,944
Every month on the 25th.

518
00:40:05,528 --> 00:40:07,488
It's when sea hares come through customs

519
00:40:07,571 --> 00:40:08,697
at Busan Port.

520
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:13,953
Mom, I'm being discharged.

521
00:40:14,036 --> 00:40:15,663
Is there herbal tonic at home?

522
00:40:16,247 --> 00:40:18,457
I can't even lift a finger.

523
00:40:18,541 --> 00:40:20,209
Send me a driver, Mom.

524
00:40:22,044 --> 00:40:25,047
What do you mean
you'll have to toughen me up?

525
00:40:25,131 --> 00:40:26,507
I'm not a kid anymore.

526
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:28,300
I've reached male menopause.

527
00:40:29,051 --> 00:40:29,885
Mom…

528
00:40:30,719 --> 00:40:32,012
Hello?

529
00:40:32,096 --> 00:40:34,056
Hello?

530
00:40:37,184 --> 00:40:38,436
Hello?

531
00:40:38,519 --> 00:40:40,312
I mean, who is it?

532
00:40:43,941 --> 00:40:44,775
Please watch your step.

533
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:00,875
Dad.

534
00:41:00,958 --> 00:41:02,126
Hey.

535
00:41:02,209 --> 00:41:05,212
My poor son.

536
00:41:05,296 --> 00:41:08,466
Taking care of me
landed you in the hospital.

537
00:41:09,133 --> 00:41:10,676
That's not it, Dad.

538
00:41:11,177 --> 00:41:13,596
This isn't because I had to nurse you.

539
00:41:13,679 --> 00:41:14,805
Geum-dong,

540
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:17,516
I'm sorry.

541
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:18,726
Goodness.

542
00:41:19,894 --> 00:41:21,812
No, Dad.

543
00:41:22,438 --> 00:41:23,481
Don't be like that.

544
00:41:24,899 --> 00:41:26,484
-It hurts.
-Does it hurt?

545
00:41:26,567 --> 00:41:28,402
Dad, that also hurts.

546
00:41:28,486 --> 00:41:30,237
Right. Goodness.

547
00:41:44,585 --> 00:41:45,503
Start the car.

548
00:41:46,837 --> 00:41:48,047
How did you get in?

549
00:41:48,130 --> 00:41:48,964
Quit yapping

550
00:41:49,882 --> 00:41:52,426
-and drive.
-How did you get in?

551
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:55,346
-How is that important?
-It is to me.

552
00:41:55,429 --> 00:41:57,306
I got myself a fully loaded car.

553
00:41:57,389 --> 00:41:59,725
It shouldn't be broken into this easily.

554
00:41:59,808 --> 00:42:01,143
Shut up, you old hag.

555
00:42:01,227 --> 00:42:03,312
-What did he just say?
-Shut up.

556
00:42:03,395 --> 00:42:04,772
Take a left at the intersection.

557
00:42:04,855 --> 00:42:06,273
Who are you boys?

558
00:42:06,815 --> 00:42:08,275
I'm just curious.

559
00:42:09,276 --> 00:42:10,528
Who are you?

560
00:42:27,253 --> 00:42:29,797
Tell me. Who sent you boys?

561
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:31,590
You can at least tell me that.

562
00:42:31,674 --> 00:42:33,759
Just shut up and get in, you old hag.

563
00:42:36,053 --> 00:42:37,304
Hurry up.

564
00:43:07,209 --> 00:43:09,753
Why is the world full of scumbags?

565
00:43:09,837 --> 00:43:10,879
Annoying pests.

566
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:16,927
Guns in Korea? For crying out loud.

567
00:43:18,095 --> 00:43:19,930
I guess I should be armed myself.

568
00:43:24,643 --> 00:43:27,771
What the hell is Geum-ju up to anyway?

569
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:32,401
I feel terrible for Nam-in and Bong-go.

570
00:43:59,887 --> 00:44:01,221
Where am I?

571
00:44:02,514 --> 00:44:04,600
Who am I?

572
00:44:14,818 --> 00:44:16,487
-Chamma.
-Yes?

573
00:44:16,570 --> 00:44:17,946
Can you run a trace on this?

574
00:44:18,030 --> 00:44:19,323
This is where the antidote is made.

575
00:44:19,907 --> 00:44:20,991
Got it.

576
00:44:21,075 --> 00:44:22,534
I'll get the coordinates.

577
00:44:24,787 --> 00:44:26,955
This might take some time.

578
00:44:27,539 --> 00:44:30,084
Did your wife get you this?

579
00:44:31,001 --> 00:44:32,086
My wife?

580
00:44:33,087 --> 00:44:33,921
Why you…

581
00:44:39,259 --> 00:44:41,470
But where are the other two?

582
00:44:41,553 --> 00:44:43,514
They were summoned
by the commissioner general.

583
00:44:54,149 --> 00:44:55,234
Hey, Nam-in.

584
00:44:55,317 --> 00:44:56,902
What's up, Nam-soon?

585
00:44:56,985 --> 00:44:59,780
Mom grounded me,
so I've been staying home.

586
00:45:00,823 --> 00:45:02,658
So I've been having
fried chicken every day.

587
00:45:03,742 --> 00:45:06,620
Marinated fried chicken,
soy sauce fried chicken,

588
00:45:06,703 --> 00:45:07,871
and plain fried chicken.

589
00:45:08,997 --> 00:45:10,332
Are you home alone?

590
00:45:10,416 --> 00:45:12,209
Come on over and join me.

591
00:45:12,292 --> 00:45:14,670
Okay, I'll be there.

592
00:45:14,753 --> 00:45:16,880
Keep the doors locked until I arrive.

593
00:45:16,964 --> 00:45:18,298
Sure. Hurry on over.

594
00:45:18,382 --> 00:45:20,008
Got it.

595
00:45:21,385 --> 00:45:23,345
GEUMJU HOSPITAL

596
00:45:23,429 --> 00:45:24,638
Did the patient Hwang Guk-jong

597
00:45:25,597 --> 00:45:27,724
have his stitches removed?

598
00:46:04,344 --> 00:46:05,637
Who are you?

599
00:46:09,183 --> 00:46:10,058
Hold on.

600
00:46:10,726 --> 00:46:12,019
Who are you?

601
00:46:12,603 --> 00:46:13,687
I'm

602
00:46:13,770 --> 00:46:15,022
Gil Joong-gan's…

603
00:46:16,565 --> 00:46:18,108
boyfriend.

604
00:46:18,192 --> 00:46:19,610
Oh, her friend.

605
00:46:19,693 --> 00:46:21,028
No, not just her friend.

606
00:46:21,111 --> 00:46:23,405
I'm her boyfriend.

607
00:46:24,406 --> 00:46:25,782
Her boyfriend?

608
00:46:25,866 --> 00:46:27,326
That's an odd thing to say.

609
00:46:27,409 --> 00:46:28,368
We…

610
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:32,581
enjoyed hangover soup together.

611
00:46:34,249 --> 00:46:35,918
You know what that means.

612
00:46:36,543 --> 00:46:38,337
Hangover soup is eaten at breakfast.

613
00:46:39,338 --> 00:46:41,632
We've spent the night together.

614
00:46:42,758 --> 00:46:44,760
Wait, so you two slept together?

615
00:46:44,843 --> 00:46:45,886
Of course.

616
00:46:47,554 --> 00:46:48,555
I…

617
00:46:49,556 --> 00:46:52,059
am in love with Gil Joong-gan.

618
00:46:53,185 --> 00:46:54,228
She is my lady.

619
00:46:57,189 --> 00:46:59,399
You damn sleazebag!

620
00:47:01,068 --> 00:47:03,278
So much for being a gentleman.

621
00:47:03,904 --> 00:47:06,990
Would you rather have a crushed skull
instead of a busted tailbone?

622
00:47:07,074 --> 00:47:08,992
Watch your language. A damn sleazebag?

623
00:47:09,076 --> 00:47:12,454
Do I have to knock your teeth
into your throat

624
00:47:12,538 --> 00:47:13,872
for you to shut up?

625
00:47:15,165 --> 00:47:16,708
How old are you, you jerk?

626
00:47:16,792 --> 00:47:19,294
I'm old enough, you twerp!

627
00:47:20,504 --> 00:47:22,089
-Hey!
-Gosh, I'm sorry.

628
00:47:22,881 --> 00:47:24,091
-My tailbone.
-Goodness.

629
00:47:25,384 --> 00:47:28,887
-Why, you cowardly punk!
-Let go of me!

630
00:47:28,971 --> 00:47:30,055
Let go.

631
00:47:34,935 --> 00:47:36,979
What have you been up to these days?

632
00:47:37,062 --> 00:47:39,356
I was attacked by armed men today.

633
00:47:39,439 --> 00:47:41,441
I'm down with you
trying to uphold justice,

634
00:47:41,525 --> 00:47:43,318
but at least give me a heads-up.

635
00:47:43,402 --> 00:47:45,487
Don't always count on the fact
that I'm strong.

636
00:47:48,156 --> 00:47:49,157
Hang up for now.

637
00:47:49,241 --> 00:47:50,909
Just shut it and hang up.

638
00:47:53,954 --> 00:47:55,539
Yes, Jun-hee?

639
00:47:56,415 --> 00:47:59,084
Joong-gan, I'm outside your house.

640
00:47:59,585 --> 00:48:01,003
Really?

641
00:48:01,086 --> 00:48:02,379
Just a second.

642
00:48:02,921 --> 00:48:05,382
Ma'am, get the door!

643
00:48:05,924 --> 00:48:08,468
Just a moment, Jun-hee.

644
00:48:08,552 --> 00:48:10,554
Right, of course.

645
00:48:42,002 --> 00:48:43,003
Jun-hee.

646
00:48:58,435 --> 00:48:59,436
Joong-gan,

647
00:49:00,145 --> 00:49:02,689
everything has been settled.

648
00:49:03,649 --> 00:49:04,650
Now,

649
00:49:04,733 --> 00:49:06,818
we can love each other
to our heart's content!

650
00:49:08,987 --> 00:49:09,946
Jun-hee.

651
00:49:11,698 --> 00:49:12,949
Joong-gan.

652
00:49:14,785 --> 00:49:17,579
Jun-hee, my bratty daughter…

653
00:49:18,997 --> 00:49:21,583
I mean, no one's home at the moment.

654
00:49:26,963 --> 00:49:28,256
How about

655
00:49:29,132 --> 00:49:31,593
we watch Netflix and chill?

656
00:49:35,722 --> 00:49:36,848
I'd love that.

657
00:49:39,976 --> 00:49:41,019
Likewise.

658
00:49:45,774 --> 00:49:47,275
Unbelievable.

659
00:49:47,359 --> 00:49:49,945
I'm going to kill them both.

660
00:49:50,028 --> 00:49:51,697
Damn it.

661
00:49:53,865 --> 00:49:56,493
Dad, please be rational.

662
00:49:56,576 --> 00:49:58,662
You're only making it harder on me.

663
00:49:58,745 --> 00:50:00,872
Geum-dong, we're going home.

664
00:50:00,956 --> 00:50:02,124
I bet you didn't know.

665
00:50:02,207 --> 00:50:04,459
I haven't been home
since I landed in Korea.

666
00:50:04,543 --> 00:50:06,920
Let me go by the house first.

667
00:50:07,003 --> 00:50:08,463
Didn't you hear your doctor?

668
00:50:08,547 --> 00:50:11,091
You need absolute rest.

669
00:50:11,174 --> 00:50:12,134
That's not necessary--

670
00:50:13,093 --> 00:50:14,803
Goodness.

671
00:50:17,889 --> 00:50:20,350
How did my life turn out like this?

672
00:50:21,017 --> 00:50:22,936
Why was I even born?

673
00:50:23,019 --> 00:50:24,980
Why would you say such a thing?

674
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:26,565
Haven't you…

675
00:50:27,649 --> 00:50:29,776
lived far too long to say that?

676
00:50:31,987 --> 00:50:34,114
Jeez.

677
00:51:03,977 --> 00:51:05,479
What are you up to, Tsetseg?

678
00:51:16,114 --> 00:51:18,366
"I'm having fried chicken."

679
00:51:22,496 --> 00:51:23,622
Is it your boyfriend?

680
00:51:23,705 --> 00:51:25,373
As if.

681
00:51:25,457 --> 00:51:27,375
I quite like your boyfriend.

682
00:51:27,959 --> 00:51:28,835
My boyfriend?

683
00:51:28,919 --> 00:51:30,045
The cop.

684
00:51:30,587 --> 00:51:33,507
He's been wishing me luck
ever since I left the hospital

685
00:51:33,590 --> 00:51:35,133
and has been calling me.

686
00:51:35,217 --> 00:51:36,802
He asked how I was doing

687
00:51:36,885 --> 00:51:38,345
and thanked me for staying strong.

688
00:51:39,221 --> 00:51:41,306
-Did Gan I-sik really do that?
-Yes.

689
00:51:41,389 --> 00:51:43,725
He even suggested we ride bikes together.

690
00:51:43,809 --> 00:51:45,101
I like the guy.

691
00:51:49,689 --> 00:51:51,733
I wonder what Grandma's going to do

692
00:51:52,442 --> 00:51:54,110
about Grandpa and Barista Seo.

693
00:51:55,237 --> 00:51:56,196
What are you talking about?

694
00:51:56,279 --> 00:51:57,614
I guess you haven't heard.

695
00:51:57,697 --> 00:51:59,074
Grandma's seeing someone,

696
00:51:59,157 --> 00:52:01,201
but Grandpa showed up after ten years.

697
00:52:01,284 --> 00:52:02,285
My gosh.

698
00:52:02,369 --> 00:52:05,247
So they're in a love triangle
like the ones you see in K-dramas?

699
00:52:05,330 --> 00:52:08,124
Yes, a passionate love triangle.

700
00:52:08,208 --> 00:52:10,627
Gosh, it's a mess.

701
00:52:15,090 --> 00:52:15,966
Wait.

702
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:18,093
Shouldn't Dad be out by now?

703
00:52:19,344 --> 00:52:21,847
He said he was in the projection room.
That's odd.

704
00:52:22,347 --> 00:52:23,390
Jeez.

705
00:52:35,151 --> 00:52:36,361
TSETSEG

706
00:52:47,247 --> 00:52:48,331
Sir,

707
00:52:48,415 --> 00:52:51,418
it's about the late Hong Jeong-ho,
the part-timer from Logistics Team 3.

708
00:52:51,501 --> 00:52:52,878
I went by to see his family.

709
00:52:52,961 --> 00:52:56,715
According to his younger brother,
they're already receiving financial aid.

710
00:52:57,299 --> 00:52:58,133
Really?

711
00:52:58,884 --> 00:53:00,176
And the benefactor

712
00:53:00,677 --> 00:53:01,553
is Gang Nam-soon.

713
00:53:09,603 --> 00:53:10,729
Bring his brother to me

714
00:53:11,730 --> 00:53:13,148
right this instant.

715
00:53:21,740 --> 00:53:22,782
Damn it.

716
00:53:23,366 --> 00:53:24,492
For crying out loud.

717
00:53:26,036 --> 00:53:27,162
There will be a disciplinary hearing.

718
00:53:27,245 --> 00:53:28,496
We expected that.

719
00:53:28,580 --> 00:53:30,498
Our Drug Investigation Unit
will be disbanded.

720
00:53:30,582 --> 00:53:32,167
We've been removed from our duties

721
00:53:32,250 --> 00:53:33,335
pending the outcome.

722
00:53:33,919 --> 00:53:35,003
They took us off the case.

723
00:53:36,129 --> 00:53:38,465
We also expected that.

724
00:53:38,548 --> 00:53:41,468
Commissioner General An wants
to deal with us before he's replaced.

725
00:53:41,551 --> 00:53:43,428
Those rotten bastards.

726
00:53:57,025 --> 00:53:57,943
Sir,

727
00:53:58,026 --> 00:54:00,320
I have the video you requested.

728
00:54:17,587 --> 00:54:19,381
SUPER-STRONG WOMAN REVEALED TO BE
HWANG GEUM-JU'S DAUGHTER

729
00:54:19,464 --> 00:54:21,299
GER INCIDENT AT HAN RIVER PARK,
ART ACADEMY FIRE

730
00:54:23,551 --> 00:54:26,012
GEUMJU TV NEWS

731
00:54:35,647 --> 00:54:36,690
You're here.

732
00:54:39,901 --> 00:54:40,902
Ms. Jung,

733
00:54:41,569 --> 00:54:43,405
I don't think Geumju TV can be launched.

734
00:54:43,488 --> 00:54:45,115
Because we were barred from airing,

735
00:54:45,198 --> 00:54:46,825
she's countering
with a spontaneous live broadcast.

736
00:54:46,908 --> 00:54:48,493
If this leads to Ms. Hwang's arrest…

737
00:54:52,747 --> 00:54:53,915
Are you all right?

738
00:55:04,342 --> 00:55:06,469
Okay, let us begin.

739
00:55:07,012 --> 00:55:08,263
CEO RYU SI-O

740
00:55:23,069 --> 00:55:23,987
Welcome.

741
00:55:26,072 --> 00:55:28,575
I heard someone
was supporting you financially.

742
00:55:31,619 --> 00:55:32,829
Is that person's name

743
00:55:34,164 --> 00:55:35,373
Gang Nam-soon?

744
00:55:36,041 --> 00:55:36,958
That's right.

745
00:55:38,918 --> 00:55:41,671
Then you must know
Gang Nam-soon's contact information.

746
00:55:42,922 --> 00:55:43,923
Yes.

747
00:55:45,425 --> 00:55:46,843
You would also know her face.

748
00:55:46,926 --> 00:55:48,094
Yes.

749
00:55:56,269 --> 00:55:57,312
DIRECTOR JUNG DAE-CHEOL

750
00:56:02,901 --> 00:56:03,902
Yes?

751
00:56:03,985 --> 00:56:05,570
I have the video, Mr. Ryu.

752
00:56:06,112 --> 00:56:08,615
It's a large file,
so I'll send it via email.

753
00:56:09,991 --> 00:56:11,743
Send me a screenshot of her face

754
00:56:12,786 --> 00:56:13,787
right now.

755
00:56:22,879 --> 00:56:24,589
-Is he not picking up?
-No.

756
00:56:34,766 --> 00:56:36,017
Where did he go?

757
00:56:37,060 --> 00:56:38,061
Dad?

758
00:56:47,195 --> 00:56:48,154
I'm…

759
00:56:48,738 --> 00:56:51,074
-quitting.
-Don't be ridiculous.

760
00:56:51,991 --> 00:56:53,451
After the hard work we did?

761
00:56:53,535 --> 00:56:55,703
You can't quit
an hour after putting me to work.

762
00:56:55,787 --> 00:56:57,622
This is the time to be resilient.

763
00:56:57,705 --> 00:56:59,541
It's wrong to stop working on this case.

764
00:56:59,624 --> 00:57:01,334
I wasn't talking about the case.

765
00:57:04,254 --> 00:57:05,255
KANG HEE-SIK

766
00:57:05,338 --> 00:57:07,257
I'm quitting the police force.

767
00:57:07,340 --> 00:57:08,299
What?

768
00:57:09,717 --> 00:57:10,760
What the…

769
00:57:11,427 --> 00:57:13,429
Remember what
the senior superintendent said?

770
00:57:13,513 --> 00:57:14,389
He told us to wait.

771
00:57:14,472 --> 00:57:15,515
I'm done waiting.

772
00:57:15,598 --> 00:57:18,601
I'd rather become
the Sherlock Holmes of our time.

773
00:57:19,853 --> 00:57:21,813
Sherlock?
Does that mean Ryu Si-o is Lupin?

774
00:57:21,896 --> 00:57:23,314
I call dibs on Watson.

775
00:57:23,398 --> 00:57:25,233
I'll be Detective Conan from Closed Case.

776
00:57:25,316 --> 00:57:27,026
Here.

777
00:57:29,028 --> 00:57:30,155
What the hell?

778
00:57:31,072 --> 00:57:32,198
Where did that money come from?

779
00:57:33,908 --> 00:57:35,660
I never thought I'd spend it this way.

780
00:57:35,743 --> 00:57:39,038
Handle outlaws outside the law,
and fight crime with crime.

781
00:57:40,206 --> 00:57:41,958
I'd like to recruit you all.

782
00:57:42,041 --> 00:57:44,043
Do you know what this cash implies?

783
00:57:44,127 --> 00:57:46,713
No tax. Nothing will be deducted.

784
00:57:47,672 --> 00:57:49,591
Babe, I love you.

785
00:57:49,674 --> 00:57:50,758
I love you so much.

786
00:57:50,842 --> 00:57:53,636
Here's to a farewell and welcome party!

787
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:54,888
How about pork belly with soju?

788
00:57:54,971 --> 00:57:56,181
No, make it plum wine.

789
00:57:56,264 --> 00:57:58,391
No, black raspberry wine!

790
00:57:58,475 --> 00:57:59,642
-Black raspberry wine!
-Black raspberry wine!

791
00:57:59,726 --> 00:58:01,936
Come on, let's go fatten our bellies.

792
00:58:02,020 --> 00:58:04,314
You have more than enough money.

793
00:58:06,900 --> 00:58:07,859
It should be mixed.

794
00:58:07,942 --> 00:58:09,152
Take one each.

795
00:58:09,235 --> 00:58:11,070
-All right.
-Here we go.

796
00:58:11,821 --> 00:58:12,947
Cheers.

797
00:58:19,078 --> 00:58:22,081
So is this day one
of our private investigation agency?

798
00:58:22,165 --> 00:58:23,124
Yes.

799
00:58:23,208 --> 00:58:25,627
First, I need to find us an office space.

800
00:58:25,710 --> 00:58:26,628
Let's…

801
00:58:27,462 --> 00:58:28,671
work out of a ger.

802
00:58:28,755 --> 00:58:30,423
We can ask his wife to build us one.

803
00:58:30,507 --> 00:58:31,633
-Seriously?
-Hey.

804
00:58:31,716 --> 00:58:34,677
She's not the same person
she was back then.

805
00:58:34,761 --> 00:58:36,888
She's above building gers now, you know?

806
00:58:37,555 --> 00:58:39,015
We'll build it ourselves.

807
00:58:39,098 --> 00:58:40,558
It won't take us four that long.

808
00:58:40,642 --> 00:58:42,977
We're not in our twenties like you.

809
00:58:43,061 --> 00:58:43,978
Exactly.

810
00:58:44,062 --> 00:58:45,772
It's the middle of winter.
We'll freeze to death.

811
00:58:45,855 --> 00:58:47,357
-Exactly.
-You know,

812
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:49,484
all the heroes born in turbulent times

813
00:58:50,652 --> 00:58:52,612
were fueled by their grit.

814
00:58:52,695 --> 00:58:54,531
-Grit, my foot.
-Let's go.

815
00:58:55,240 --> 00:58:56,783
We're off to our new hideout.

816
00:58:56,866 --> 00:58:58,243
-Just like that?
-Where is it?

817
00:59:32,485 --> 00:59:33,653
Mom!

818
00:59:36,406 --> 00:59:37,323
My gosh.

819
00:59:44,706 --> 00:59:47,750
What do you think you're doing, Mom?!

820
00:59:51,921 --> 00:59:52,755
Mister,

821
00:59:52,839 --> 00:59:54,299
how dare you come here?

822
00:59:54,382 --> 00:59:56,718
How could you break my dad's heart
when he's on the mend

823
00:59:57,302 --> 01:00:00,013
and enjoy a steamy movie with my mom?

824
01:00:01,097 --> 01:00:03,600
Let go of him, you insolent brat.

825
01:00:03,683 --> 01:00:05,310
I didn't get you those pricy herbal tonics

826
01:00:05,393 --> 01:00:07,270
just so you can manhandle him
and yell at me.

827
01:00:08,688 --> 01:00:12,275
You don't care about Dad at all!

828
01:00:12,775 --> 01:00:15,236
It's inhumane, Mom.

829
01:00:16,070 --> 01:00:17,030
Leave.

830
01:00:17,113 --> 01:00:19,198
-Leave already!
-Geum-dong.

831
01:00:19,282 --> 01:00:22,452
How could you both do this…

832
01:00:27,915 --> 01:00:29,459

01:01:13,086 --> 01:01:16,047
DIRECTOR JUNG DAE-CHEOL

837
01:01:19,884 --> 01:01:21,594
That's her. She's Gang Nam-soon.

838
01:01:27,141 --> 01:01:27,975
Leave.

839
01:02:18,609 --> 01:02:21,028
STRONG GIRL NAM-SOON

840
01:02:21,112 --> 01:02:23,239
I don't distribute drugs.

841
01:02:23,322 --> 01:02:25,658
Hwang Geum-ju. She is the axis of evil.

842
01:02:25,742 --> 01:02:27,785
There's something
you need to do right away.

843
01:02:27,869 --> 01:02:28,953
Joong-gan!

844
01:02:29,036 --> 01:02:30,621
How dare you go after my man?

845
01:02:31,247 --> 01:02:32,123
Bring it!

846
01:02:32,206 --> 01:02:34,917
So who the hell are you really?

847
01:02:35,001 --> 01:02:36,294
I think I'll be of use to you.

848
01:02:36,377 --> 01:02:37,670
So how can I be of service?

849
01:02:37,754 --> 01:02:38,796
I get it now.

850
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:41,299
I finally understand
why Pavel executes traitors.

851
01:02:41,382 --> 01:02:42,884
Tsetseg is Gang Nam-soon.

852
01:02:42,967 --> 01:02:45,386
Everyone in my family nearly died.

853
01:02:45,470 --> 01:02:46,387
I need you to do this.

854
01:02:46,471 --> 01:02:47,930
The entire nation is in uproar.

855
01:02:48,014 --> 01:02:50,141
The DIU at Ganghan Police Precinct
has been reinstated.

856
01:02:52,685 --> 01:02:57,690
