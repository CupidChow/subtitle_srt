1
00:00:42,667 --> 00:00:45,962
STRONG GIRL NAM-SOON

2
00:01:34,052 --> 00:01:35,220
This is just in.

3
00:01:35,303 --> 00:01:36,846
An attack was made on the car

4
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:39,015
driving the newly appointed
Commissioner General Lee Jeong-sik.

5
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:43,228
Members of his security detail
were all found dead at the scene.

6
00:01:43,311 --> 00:01:45,396
Commissioner General Lee
is yet to be found,

7
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:48,942
and while the police
are leaning toward a homicide,

8
00:01:49,025 --> 00:01:52,904
they have not ruled out
the possibility of an abduction.

9
00:01:56,825 --> 00:01:57,867
Good evening.

10
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:01,121
Good evening.

11
00:02:01,204 --> 00:02:02,163
Where's the dashcam?

12
00:02:02,247 --> 00:02:04,290
There isn't one.
The culprit must've taken it.

13
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:21,933
Hey,

14
00:02:22,016 --> 00:02:23,601
I don't see any bullet casings.

15
00:02:23,685 --> 00:02:24,561
Was this a car crash?

16
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:26,479
No, I only see one pair of skid marks.

17
00:02:26,563 --> 00:02:28,189
They would've had time to load their guns.

18
00:02:28,273 --> 00:02:29,774
That means they died instantly.

19
00:02:29,858 --> 00:02:32,026
Could there have been multiple assailants?

20
00:02:32,861 --> 00:02:35,155
There is no evidence
of weapons being used.

21
00:02:35,238 --> 00:02:37,240
Someone killed them with their bare hands.

22
00:02:40,869 --> 00:02:41,870
Ryu Si-o did this.

23
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:02,473
I'll bring your food.

24
00:03:05,435 --> 00:03:06,519
Over here.

25
00:03:08,187 --> 00:03:09,230
Hurry on over.

26
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:14,611
I'm here…

27
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:26,789
I'm sorry.

28
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:30,919
This happened because of me.

29
00:03:33,129 --> 00:03:35,965
We're the ones who approached
and deceived your family.

30
00:03:38,343 --> 00:03:39,928
She urged us to lead upstanding lives.

31
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:42,222
I guess people like us

32
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:44,474
are doomed to a certain end.

33
00:03:44,557 --> 00:03:45,558
No.

34
00:03:45,642 --> 00:03:48,519
No one in this world deserves to die

35
00:03:49,938 --> 00:03:50,772
a horrible death.

36
00:03:52,565 --> 00:03:54,359
I will pay for her funeral,

37
00:03:55,652 --> 00:03:58,947
so please invite
all of Myung-hee's friends.

38
00:04:02,617 --> 00:04:04,494
Her last moments on this earth

39
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:06,829
should at least be happy…

40
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:11,834
and well cared for.

41
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:35,233
You were right.

42
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:40,196
When she lied about being our daughter

43
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,240
and then tried to kill Nam-soon,

44
00:04:43,241 --> 00:04:44,826
I thought the worst of her.

45
00:04:48,496 --> 00:04:50,748
But I heard she kept
Nam-soon's identity a secret.

46
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:56,087
I guess people can change
when given the chance.

47
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:58,756
Maybe I shouldn't have
given her a second chance.

48
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:02,802
I should've let her go to jail.

49
00:05:06,264 --> 00:05:07,682
If I had,

50
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:11,185
she wouldn't have died like this.

51
00:05:15,732 --> 00:05:16,733
Ryu Si-o.

52
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:21,237
The only question now
is how I'll kill the bastard.

53
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:24,365
I will show the world

54
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:27,201
what kind of fate awaits evil.

55
00:05:31,581 --> 00:05:32,790
By the way,

56
00:05:34,417 --> 00:05:36,669
I know it isn't the right time for this,

57
00:05:37,545 --> 00:05:41,382
but then again,
this may be the only chance I'll get.

58
00:05:41,966 --> 00:05:43,092
You see…

59
00:05:43,634 --> 00:05:44,802
What is it?

60
00:05:46,429 --> 00:05:47,513
Are you dating someone?

61
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:51,267
What?

62
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:52,769
Back in Busan,

63
00:05:53,269 --> 00:05:56,064
Nam-in and I went to
a trendy restaurant we found online

64
00:05:56,147 --> 00:06:00,610
only to find you there
looking quite close with another man.

65
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:02,070
He's a scammer.

66
00:06:02,987 --> 00:06:04,614
But his crimes are all over the place,

67
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:06,074
and it's unclear which field they're in.

68
00:06:06,157 --> 00:06:07,158
A scammer?

69
00:06:10,161 --> 00:06:11,245
That's a relief.

70
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:15,708
The work I'm engaged in

71
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:18,252
involves life-threatening risks.

72
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:20,296
If by any chance

73
00:06:21,506 --> 00:06:22,840
I die in the process,

74
00:06:24,008 --> 00:06:25,259
take good care of the kids.

75
00:06:25,343 --> 00:06:26,969
What the hell are you saying?

76
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:28,054
Why would you die?

77
00:06:28,846 --> 00:06:30,306
Why would you say such a thing?

78
00:06:30,389 --> 00:06:31,933
Why would you do it if it's so dangerous?

79
00:06:32,475 --> 00:06:33,351
Don't die.

80
00:06:33,434 --> 00:06:35,353
Your death would destroy me.

81
00:06:35,937 --> 00:06:37,105
Stop being so dramatic.

82
00:06:38,397 --> 00:06:39,565
There's no moderate bone in you.

83
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:40,566
Moderation?

84
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:41,901
Is this about your mother?

85
00:07:05,299 --> 00:07:06,843
Hey, Jeong-min.

86
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:09,387
Nam-soon, I got the license
I'd been studying for.

87
00:07:09,887 --> 00:07:10,721
Really?

88
00:07:11,889 --> 00:07:12,974
Congrats.

89
00:07:13,057 --> 00:07:16,686
By the way, Doogo's CEO
asked to see me a few days ago.

90
00:07:17,395 --> 00:07:21,399
He asked if I received support from you
after Jeong-ho passed.

91
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:23,192
I see.

92
00:07:25,987 --> 00:07:26,988
Jeong-min,

93
00:07:27,071 --> 00:07:29,866
I'm a bit busy right now,
so let's talk some other time.

94
00:07:34,036 --> 00:07:34,912
Mom.

95
00:07:35,496 --> 00:07:36,581
I need to go.

96
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:39,000
Ryu Si-o

97
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:41,794
knows who I am.

98
00:07:43,171 --> 00:07:44,005
I see.

99
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:47,341
It's about time he found out.

100
00:07:49,427 --> 00:07:50,428
Be careful.

101
00:07:50,511 --> 00:07:51,762
Okay.

102
00:07:51,846 --> 00:07:53,556
It's on.

103
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:02,273
Call me if anything comes up.

104
00:08:02,356 --> 00:08:03,274
Got it.

105
00:08:06,235 --> 00:08:07,862
Is there an update
on the commissioner general?

106
00:08:08,446 --> 00:08:10,823
The search and rescue team
had been working all night

107
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:12,283
but found nothing.

108
00:08:12,366 --> 00:08:13,493
He's still alive.

109
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:16,078
He was taken because he is of use.

110
00:08:16,662 --> 00:08:18,372
-Of course.
-That scumbag.

111
00:08:19,081 --> 00:08:19,916
I suggest

112
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:22,335
we use Pavel against him.

113
00:08:22,418 --> 00:08:25,046
-Pavel?
-We'll cause a rift between them.

114
00:08:25,129 --> 00:08:26,047
How?

115
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:27,715
They're not on good terms,

116
00:08:28,424 --> 00:08:30,301
so we'll use that to our advantage.

117
00:08:31,802 --> 00:08:32,720
Chamma.

118
00:08:33,221 --> 00:08:34,639
Can you wiretap Ryu Si-o's secret phone?

119
00:08:35,473 --> 00:08:38,851
The data Nam-soon got us
was manually copied from the phone.

120
00:08:38,935 --> 00:08:41,062
To wiretap it,
I'll need to install a program.

121
00:08:41,562 --> 00:08:43,064
But to do that,

122
00:08:43,147 --> 00:08:45,858
he'll have to click on a link
that's sent to his phone.

123
00:08:45,942 --> 00:08:47,026
And that's…

124
00:08:47,902 --> 00:08:48,945
Damn it.

125
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:59,121
Here is the CTA4885 VIP client list.

126
00:09:01,707 --> 00:09:03,084
It's the CTA4885 client list.

127
00:09:03,668 --> 00:09:06,546
Swap the Korean names for English ones
and send it to him

128
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:08,214
from a Russian phone number.

129
00:09:08,297 --> 00:09:10,841
Then he'll definitely click on it.

130
00:09:10,925 --> 00:09:11,926
Nice one.

131
00:09:15,179 --> 00:09:16,013
Agent Gang.

132
00:09:17,139 --> 00:09:18,182
Ryu Si-o

133
00:09:18,933 --> 00:09:20,309
figured out who I am.

134
00:09:27,149 --> 00:09:28,150
He killed

135
00:09:29,151 --> 00:09:30,027
Hwa-ja.

136
00:09:32,655 --> 00:09:36,242
He then texted me from her phone.

137
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:38,119
Ri Hwa-ja

138
00:09:39,161 --> 00:09:40,204
is dead?

139
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:41,914
Yes.

140
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:45,376
Ryu Si-o must've tracked her down

141
00:09:47,044 --> 00:09:48,212
to ask if she knew me.

142
00:09:51,674 --> 00:09:53,217
She hid my identity from him.

143
00:09:56,887 --> 00:09:58,014
That's probably why…

144
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:01,434
he killed her.

145
00:10:01,517 --> 00:10:02,810
He's on a rampage.

146
00:10:03,352 --> 00:10:04,687
He even took the commissioner general.

147
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:07,315
I'll take him on.

148
00:10:42,183 --> 00:10:43,392
It's me.

149
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:46,937
Why are you killing others
rather than coming after me?

150
00:10:47,021 --> 00:10:48,064
It's cowardly.

151
00:10:50,107 --> 00:10:52,151
What's wrong? Are you afraid of me?

152
00:10:52,818 --> 00:10:54,028
Let me ask you this.

153
00:10:56,238 --> 00:10:57,948
Did you purposely seek work at Doogo?

154
00:10:59,408 --> 00:11:01,619
Did you lie about who you were
to investigate me?

155
00:11:03,371 --> 00:11:05,623
Was it all a lie?

156
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:08,751
Yes, I had to put you behind bars.

157
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:14,715
You sure know
how to rub someone the wrong way.

158
00:11:16,008 --> 00:11:17,093
What I hate the most

159
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:19,220
are lies.

160
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:22,098
Then meet me face to face.

161
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:23,391
Gang Nam-soon!

162
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:25,476
You murdering druggie.

163
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:29,647
Don't you think
one of us has to die for this to end?

164
00:11:33,609 --> 00:11:35,528
Stop going after others

165
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:38,072
and take me on.

166
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:43,369
Nothing…

167
00:11:45,413 --> 00:11:46,664
will go your way.

168
00:11:53,671 --> 00:11:55,881
He hung up when I wasn't done talking!

169
00:11:55,965 --> 00:11:57,633
Damn coward.

170
00:11:57,716 --> 00:11:59,093
That piece of shit!

171
00:11:59,176 --> 00:12:01,011
That fucking asshole!

172
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:19,905
HERE IS THE UPDATED
CTA4885 VIP CLIENT LIST

173
00:12:24,952 --> 00:12:26,162
Track Ryu Si-o for me.

174
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:27,413
I'll go get him directly.

175
00:12:27,496 --> 00:12:28,831
I can't ping his location.

176
00:12:28,914 --> 00:12:31,792
His GPS is off
and he's blocked all devices I can track.

177
00:12:31,876 --> 00:12:33,502
The same goes for his secret phone.

178
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:35,171
If he were traceable,
we'd have him already.

179
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:40,634
He checked the text!

180
00:12:43,387 --> 00:12:44,221
He checked it?

181
00:12:46,557 --> 00:12:48,809
Hey, Ryu Si-o's getting a call.

182
00:12:51,312 --> 00:12:53,189
Are you the one who killed Beom?

183
00:12:55,316 --> 00:12:56,400
Who's this?

184
00:12:57,818 --> 00:12:58,819
Nozh.

185
00:13:01,405 --> 00:13:02,531
Tsar Bomba.

186
00:13:13,542 --> 00:13:15,211
No one can control me.

187
00:13:16,587 --> 00:13:17,588
Also,

188
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:20,257
I won't die as Pavel's lackey.

189
00:13:28,849 --> 00:13:29,808
What's "Tsar Bomba"?

190
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,771
It's the name of a Russian nuclear bomb.

191
00:13:33,854 --> 00:13:36,315
-What?
-It's the most powerful hydrogen bomb

192
00:13:36,398 --> 00:13:38,692
the Russians used
as a weapon of mass destruction.

193
00:13:38,776 --> 00:13:39,610
What the hell?

194
00:13:39,693 --> 00:13:41,737
Don't tell me
that was an order for a terrorist attack.

195
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:43,405
Judging by how Ryu Si-o answered,

196
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:44,406
I doubt that's true.

197
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:47,993
"I won't die as Pavel's lackey."

198
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:48,953
I see.

199
00:13:49,036 --> 00:13:49,995
It's a death order.

200
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:51,205
You're right.

201
00:13:51,288 --> 00:13:52,873
They've split up.

202
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:55,668
Lee Myung-hee's phone was turned on.

203
00:13:55,751 --> 00:13:57,253
I'll track nearby cell towers.

204
00:13:57,336 --> 00:13:58,963
I'll go and get Hwa-ja's phone.

205
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:01,298
I'll text you where.

206
00:14:01,382 --> 00:14:02,341
I'll go with her.

207
00:14:02,424 --> 00:14:03,676
-Call if anything happens.
-Got it.

208
00:14:04,885 --> 00:14:06,220
-Where is it?
-Breaking news.

209
00:14:06,303 --> 00:14:08,973
A special counsel has been appointed
to look into Doogo's CEO Ryu Si-o,

210
00:14:09,056 --> 00:14:12,184
who is wanted for the distribution
of the new synthetic drug CTA4885,

211
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:15,938
and noted political and financial figures
who had financial dealings with him.

212
00:14:27,241 --> 00:14:29,743
Sir, you have been subpoenaed.

213
00:14:33,163 --> 00:14:35,958
Never has a special counsel
been appointed for a drug case.

214
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:37,501
Deputy Chief Prosecutor Moon Seong-u

215
00:14:37,585 --> 00:14:40,629
testified that he was threatened
by Ryu Si-o,

216
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:44,550
confirming Ryu's crimes regarding CTA4885.

217
00:14:45,342 --> 00:14:48,888
With that revelation, the focus is now
on the executives and auditors of Doogo,

218
00:14:48,971 --> 00:14:50,681
since many of those appointed

219
00:14:50,764 --> 00:14:53,767
are current members
of the National Assembly.

220
00:14:53,851 --> 00:14:55,853
Ryu Si-o is now under a travel ban

221
00:14:55,936 --> 00:14:57,146
and is on the wanted list…

222
00:14:57,229 --> 00:14:58,439
My mom's the best.

223
00:14:58,522 --> 00:14:59,356
DOBERMAN

224
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,066
I'm happy to be her daughter.

225
00:15:02,318 --> 00:15:03,569
I miss Nam-soon.

226
00:15:04,653 --> 00:15:06,739
I'll sincerely apologize when I see her.

227
00:15:13,037 --> 00:15:15,748
A travel ban means
he can't leave the country, right?

228
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:17,625
Yes.

229
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:20,586
Now that there's a special counsel,
he won't get off the hook.

230
00:15:20,669 --> 00:15:23,047
However, there's no way to track him.

231
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:27,217
The issue lies with him
being on the outs with Pavel.

232
00:15:27,885 --> 00:15:29,470
They're also looking for him.

233
00:15:29,553 --> 00:15:32,014
The fact that he's still unscathed

234
00:15:32,723 --> 00:15:35,809
means he's somewhere
that even Pavel doesn't know about.

235
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:37,436
Like a secret hideout.

236
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:41,815
He wouldn't be challenging Pavel like this

237
00:15:42,983 --> 00:15:44,568
without an ace up his sleeve.

238
00:15:45,152 --> 00:15:46,612
He must have a way out.

239
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:50,866
What could that be?

240
00:15:58,374 --> 00:16:00,125
Beom is dead.

241
00:16:00,876 --> 00:16:01,877
Was it Ryu Si-o's doing?

242
00:16:03,212 --> 00:16:06,173
The death of a high-ranking Pavel member

243
00:16:06,256 --> 00:16:08,342
will cause a crack
within the organization.

244
00:16:08,425 --> 00:16:10,219
It's not just Pavel.

245
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:11,595
Doogo is suffering too.

246
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:14,890
Doogo has been disposing of
all their documents.

247
00:16:15,516 --> 00:16:16,642
Among them,

248
00:16:16,725 --> 00:16:20,020
our agent found what appeared to be
evidence of money laundering.

249
00:16:20,896 --> 00:16:22,648
Do you know someone named Yeom Su-san?

250
00:16:23,899 --> 00:16:25,401
All too well.

251
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:27,319
Our origins were the same,

252
00:16:27,403 --> 00:16:28,612
but I ran legitimate businesses

253
00:16:29,446 --> 00:16:31,031
while she ran back-alley ones.

254
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:32,157
She's the one

255
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:34,910
who's been laundering money for Doogo.

256
00:16:35,953 --> 00:16:38,288
Recently, the man you asked about,

257
00:16:38,372 --> 00:16:41,417
Bread Song, has been meeting her
more frequently.

258
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:12,698
Hey, that was fast.

259
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:25,377
The next batch will be laundered here.

260
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:28,881
TIGER BANK

261
00:17:28,964 --> 00:17:30,591
And is this person trustworthy?

262
00:17:30,674 --> 00:17:33,260
It's money we trust, not people.

263
00:17:34,178 --> 00:17:37,139
It's too risky to launder money
with cryptocurrency only.

264
00:17:37,848 --> 00:17:39,767
Most of it will be transferred
into cryptocurrency,

265
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:42,269
and the chump change
will be dealt with through that bank.

266
00:17:42,352 --> 00:17:44,688
Don't put all your eggs in one basket.

267
00:17:45,814 --> 00:17:48,358
I've set up a meeting for tomorrow,
so be there on time.

268
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:50,986
I hope what I asked for is going well.

269
00:17:52,321 --> 00:17:53,155
Of course.

270
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:27,356
Yes, Mr. Ryu.

271
00:18:27,981 --> 00:18:29,108
Go directly to the lab

272
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:31,735
and bring me Dr. Choi.

273
00:18:32,236 --> 00:18:34,696
"Dr. Choi"?

274
00:18:38,033 --> 00:18:41,078
DOOGO RESEARCH LAB, CHOI KI-TAE

275
00:18:41,662 --> 00:18:42,496
This guy…

276
00:18:44,581 --> 00:18:46,500
I saw him at Doogo's sea hare lab.

277
00:18:47,209 --> 00:18:49,002
We need to get to him first.

278
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:54,133
Hello?

279
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,426
I have the last list of clients.

280
00:18:57,010 --> 00:18:58,554
It's long, so I'll send it in two files.

281
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:01,265
This was hard to get, you know.

282
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:04,143
I kept my promise,

283
00:19:04,226 --> 00:19:06,228
so you keep yours.

284
00:19:06,311 --> 00:19:07,980
Right. You did good work.

285
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:12,401
Look further into Dr. Choi.

286
00:19:12,484 --> 00:19:15,112
I'll give you the list of clients,
so arrest them first.

287
00:19:15,195 --> 00:19:16,488
Okay, let's go.

288
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:22,536
I think I know why Ryu Si-o
is taking a stand against Pavel.

289
00:19:23,245 --> 00:19:24,454
That's his secret weapon.

290
00:19:24,538 --> 00:19:25,831
MOM

291
00:19:31,545 --> 00:19:32,629
Hey, Mom.

292
00:19:32,713 --> 00:19:34,047
GANGHAN POLICE PRECINCT

293
00:19:34,131 --> 00:19:35,257
My daughter.

294
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:38,218
Mom, I'm sorry.

295
00:19:38,802 --> 00:19:41,013
Something came up,
and I had to hurry home.

296
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:42,973
Are you in Seoul?

297
00:19:43,056 --> 00:19:46,852
Your Gangnam mom, Geum-ju,
put me up in a nice hotel,

298
00:19:46,935 --> 00:19:48,437
and I slept like a baby.

299
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:51,064
She also gave me a lot of money.
Should I accept it?

300
00:19:51,648 --> 00:19:52,649
Take it.

301
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:55,903
Once this case is solved,

302
00:19:55,986 --> 00:19:58,405
my boyfriend and I
will visit you in Mongolia.

303
00:19:59,364 --> 00:20:00,949
We'll come to you and Dad.

304
00:20:01,491 --> 00:20:03,160
Your father would love that.

305
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:06,330
I'm with Bong-go and Nam-in at the moment.

306
00:20:07,164 --> 00:20:08,165
I know.

307
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:11,001
Have a safe trip back to Mongolia.

308
00:20:11,585 --> 00:20:13,420
I love you, Mom.

309
00:20:24,848 --> 00:20:27,267
Name, Choi Ki-tae. Born in 1981.

310
00:20:27,351 --> 00:20:28,894
Before being hired by Doogo,

311
00:20:28,977 --> 00:20:30,354
-he was in prison.
-In prison?

312
00:20:30,437 --> 00:20:31,563
Yes.

313
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:35,067
He got caught dealing narcotics

314
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:37,611
he manufactured
from veterinary tranquilizers.

315
00:20:38,862 --> 00:20:40,739
Someone posted his bail though,

316
00:20:40,822 --> 00:20:42,491
and he started working
at the lab right after.

317
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:45,702
He must've created CTA4885
and developed the antidote.

318
00:20:46,286 --> 00:20:47,621
The lab's key man.

319
00:20:47,704 --> 00:20:49,498
That's why Ryu Si-o
took him under his wing,

320
00:20:49,581 --> 00:20:51,375
to use as a bargaining chip with Pavel.

321
00:20:52,876 --> 00:20:55,045
CHOI KI-TAE

322
00:20:55,128 --> 00:20:57,047
MAJORED IN CHEMISTRY
AT THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA

323
00:20:58,257 --> 00:20:59,675
Just do as I say.

324
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:02,970
So all I have to do is go with Mr. Yoon?

325
00:21:03,553 --> 00:21:04,721
Yes.

326
00:21:04,805 --> 00:21:06,932
And don't do anything
I didn't tell you to do.

327
00:21:07,808 --> 00:21:09,393
You must not go with strangers.

328
00:21:11,061 --> 00:21:13,146
-Got it?
-Yes, sir.

329
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:14,606
Put Mr. Yoon on the phone.

330
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,817
It's me, sir.

331
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:18,527
Keep Dr. Choi hidden there.

332
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:21,613
And track down everyone

333
00:21:23,657 --> 00:21:24,908
in Gang Nam-soon's family.

334
00:21:49,683 --> 00:21:51,810
-What now?
-I'm being hunted by the police.

335
00:21:53,228 --> 00:21:56,732
You will get nothing
once they have me in custody.

336
00:21:57,232 --> 00:21:59,401
CTA4885,

337
00:22:00,527 --> 00:22:01,737
its antidote,

338
00:22:02,946 --> 00:22:04,323
and Dr. Choi.

339
00:22:04,906 --> 00:22:06,533
What is it that you want?

340
00:22:06,616 --> 00:22:08,535
Listen closely.

341
00:22:09,911 --> 00:22:12,998
As of this moment,
Pavel will protect me with all they have.

342
00:22:14,458 --> 00:22:17,044
Get the Russian Federal Security Service
involved if necessary.

343
00:22:20,589 --> 00:22:23,008
I'm sure Pavel could easily arrange that.

344
00:22:23,592 --> 00:22:24,634
Anton.

345
00:22:26,178 --> 00:22:30,182
If you want Dr. Choi,
get rid of my travel ban.

346
00:22:30,724 --> 00:22:32,893
Tell me where Dr. Choi is first.

347
00:22:33,643 --> 00:22:37,105
Dogang Stationery. Check there.

348
00:22:49,743 --> 00:22:50,786
Do we know

349
00:22:51,286 --> 00:22:53,163
where Gang Nam-soon's family is?

350
00:22:53,914 --> 00:22:54,956
Yes, sir.

351
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:57,876
I was able to ping
Hwang Geum-ju's ex-husband's cell phone.

352
00:22:57,959 --> 00:22:59,169
He's in Seoul.

353
00:23:05,092 --> 00:23:06,176
Kill them.

354
00:23:07,469 --> 00:23:08,303
Kill them all.

355
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:15,602
The Mongolian woman who raised
Gang Nam-soon is currently with them.

356
00:23:19,815 --> 00:23:21,191
Gyeonggu-ro 42-gil.

357
00:23:21,274 --> 00:23:22,984
Dogang Stationery.
That's where Dr. Choi is.

358
00:23:25,904 --> 00:23:26,905
Nam-soon.

359
00:23:31,409 --> 00:23:33,411
We're on our way to Gyeonggu-ro 42-gil.

360
00:24:01,022 --> 00:24:02,065
DOGANG STATIONERY

361
00:24:05,485 --> 00:24:06,778
I'm heading there first.

362
00:24:06,862 --> 00:24:07,737
Meet me there.

363
00:24:39,978 --> 00:24:41,771
-He's not here.
-He's not here either.

364
00:24:41,855 --> 00:24:43,356
Dr. Choi isn't here.

365
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,692
Anton must've lied about his location.

366
00:24:54,117 --> 00:24:55,368
What a nutcase.

367
00:24:58,288 --> 00:24:59,414
Ms. Hwang,

368
00:24:59,497 --> 00:25:01,166
our live show has been announced.

369
00:25:01,708 --> 00:25:02,542
Shall we begin?

370
00:25:02,626 --> 00:25:03,919
You'll host it alone.

371
00:25:04,753 --> 00:25:06,755
I'm letting Na-young
stay in Busan a while longer.

372
00:25:06,838 --> 00:25:08,173
She needs time to recover properly.

373
00:25:08,798 --> 00:25:09,633
Of course.

374
00:25:09,716 --> 00:25:12,344
Mr. Kim, this will be
our final news broadcast.

375
00:25:12,969 --> 00:25:14,596
As such,

376
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:17,474
you may do and say whatever you please.

377
00:25:18,516 --> 00:25:19,434
Will do.

378
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:31,112
Cut. Let's take a break.

379
00:25:44,417 --> 00:25:45,252
Hold on.

380
00:25:45,335 --> 00:25:47,796
Can you turn on Geumju TV?
They're going live.

381
00:25:47,879 --> 00:25:49,130
Right. Just a second.

382
00:25:49,214 --> 00:25:52,217
They launched an app,
so we can watch from our phones.

383
00:25:54,135 --> 00:25:54,970
Here we go.

384
00:25:56,304 --> 00:25:59,307
Hello, this is Kim Gi-dae at Geumju TV.

385
00:26:00,058 --> 00:26:03,270
I'm sure you've heard about
the appointment of a special counsel

386
00:26:03,353 --> 00:26:05,855
targeting CTA4885 and Ryu Si-o.

387
00:26:06,648 --> 00:26:11,027
We deeply thank the nation
for its continued interest in the matter.

388
00:26:12,696 --> 00:26:16,491
This wraps up
the final broadcast of Geumju TV News.

389
00:26:16,574 --> 00:26:18,535
We accomplished everything
we set out to do.

390
00:26:19,494 --> 00:26:23,415
Now that the dangers of CTA4885
are finally public knowledge,

391
00:26:23,915 --> 00:26:25,792
we will greet you not as a pirate channel

392
00:26:25,875 --> 00:26:27,711
but as an official broadcasting station

393
00:26:28,211 --> 00:26:30,672
that offers content of various genres.

394
00:26:32,215 --> 00:26:34,175
We will quench the viewers' thirst

395
00:26:34,801 --> 00:26:37,512
with steamy NC-19 TV series,

396
00:26:41,933 --> 00:26:43,435
NC-29 comedy shows,

397
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,480
and NC-39 documentaries.

398
00:26:48,189 --> 00:26:52,610
Please look forward to the shows
to be aired on Geumju TV.

399
00:26:53,778 --> 00:26:55,780
GEUMJU TV NEWS

400
00:26:55,864 --> 00:26:56,698
Oops.

401
00:27:01,286 --> 00:27:03,288
Hwang Geum-ju's killing it.

402
00:27:04,497 --> 00:27:06,416
The gracious Maria.

403
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:08,501
She never disappoints.

404
00:27:08,585 --> 00:27:10,337
Hyun-soo, do you know
the owner of Geumju TV?

405
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:13,006
Of course. She gave me 200 million won…

406
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:17,385
No, I don't know her at all.

407
00:27:17,469 --> 00:27:18,845
If the Virgin Mary were to be reborn,

408
00:27:19,429 --> 00:27:21,097
she'd look just like Ms. Hwang.

409
00:27:21,181 --> 00:27:23,016
Gracious Maria.

410
00:27:24,517 --> 00:27:26,061
How about "gramma" for short?

411
00:27:26,144 --> 00:27:27,103
Gramma?

412
00:27:27,187 --> 00:27:29,439
I think it's time
we stopped inconveniencing her

413
00:27:29,522 --> 00:27:31,149
and left this hotel.

414
00:27:31,232 --> 00:27:32,734
Exactly.

415
00:27:32,817 --> 00:27:34,527
One shouldn't be this shameless.

416
00:27:34,611 --> 00:27:36,446
One shouldn't be this shameless.

417
00:27:36,529 --> 00:27:38,698
You shameless dirtbag!

418
00:27:40,575 --> 00:27:42,577
What's with me today? I must be losing it.

419
00:27:45,622 --> 00:27:46,581
We need to talk.

420
00:27:57,092 --> 00:27:57,926
What is it?

421
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:00,512
Your personal life
has been exposed online.

422
00:28:00,595 --> 00:28:03,598
You're the hottest gossip in Korea
following CTA4885.

423
00:28:07,143 --> 00:28:08,269
1. CTA4885
2. EXPOSING JI HYUN-SOO

424
00:28:08,353 --> 00:28:09,604
EXPOSING JI HYUN-SOO

425
00:28:09,687 --> 00:28:10,897
Is this true?

426
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:12,273
It says here

427
00:28:13,149 --> 00:28:16,277
that you lived with a woman
at Metro Trump Square Super-Duper Tower

428
00:28:16,361 --> 00:28:18,113
but dumped her
once you came into fame and money.

429
00:28:18,196 --> 00:28:19,322
I lived with a woman?

430
00:28:20,573 --> 00:28:21,866
Well,

431
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:23,576
that was only a tent.

432
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:25,912
And that name
is just something I painted on it.

433
00:28:25,995 --> 00:28:30,125
Advertising agencies and variety shows
are now taking back their offers.

434
00:28:30,208 --> 00:28:32,794
Get ready to pay damages
for breach of contract, you punk.

435
00:28:41,136 --> 00:28:42,387
Damn it.

436
00:28:53,982 --> 00:28:54,941
Hello?

437
00:28:55,525 --> 00:28:57,819
You lied to us.

438
00:28:59,487 --> 00:29:00,321
I lied to you?

439
00:29:00,989 --> 00:29:02,824
Dr. Choi wasn't there.

440
00:29:02,907 --> 00:29:06,119
No one was present
when our people arrived at the location.

441
00:29:08,705 --> 00:29:10,415
That's impossible.

442
00:29:14,878 --> 00:29:17,297
Did you perhaps send me
the new VIP client list?

443
00:29:18,173 --> 00:29:19,007
What?

444
00:29:19,632 --> 00:29:20,675
A VIP client list?

445
00:29:21,676 --> 00:29:22,761
Anton,

446
00:29:22,844 --> 00:29:26,931
we do not share any information
with a member who got a Tsar Bomba order.

447
00:29:40,945 --> 00:29:43,740
YEONGJIN GARLIC

448
00:29:51,331 --> 00:29:52,916
What the hell?

449
00:29:55,668 --> 00:29:56,544
Well,

450
00:29:56,628 --> 00:29:59,047
the owner of the stationery store
had stepped out for a bit,

451
00:29:59,547 --> 00:30:02,050
so I carried the guy over here.

452
00:30:04,385 --> 00:30:07,305
That must've been a garlic sack.
I hate garlic.

453
00:30:24,864 --> 00:30:26,282
He must have motion sickness.

454
00:30:26,366 --> 00:30:29,285
I ran all the way here
with him in the sack.

455
00:30:29,369 --> 00:30:30,745
Didn't Hee-sik go with you?

456
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:33,456
He's out there arresting Pavel's members
at the stationery store.

457
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:34,999
He had to request backup

458
00:30:35,083 --> 00:30:36,417
and wait for them to arrive,

459
00:30:36,501 --> 00:30:37,752
so I just ran off.

460
00:30:39,379 --> 00:30:40,380
I'm exhausted.

461
00:30:44,384 --> 00:30:48,888
You know, I arrested
all those Russian mobsters…

462
00:31:03,611 --> 00:31:05,113
Are you Ryu Si-o's key man?

463
00:31:10,201 --> 00:31:11,286
Why are you laughing?

464
00:31:18,334 --> 00:31:19,502
What's this smell?

465
00:31:20,086 --> 00:31:21,087
Did you arrest the clients?

466
00:31:21,170 --> 00:31:22,422
Of course.

467
00:31:22,505 --> 00:31:25,008
With the help of requested backup
from other DIU teams,

468
00:31:25,091 --> 00:31:28,720
we brought in
each and every one of those clients.

469
00:31:29,721 --> 00:31:31,681
Do you remember the art academy arson?

470
00:31:31,764 --> 00:31:33,641
The one where
Agent Gang saved the children.

471
00:31:36,561 --> 00:31:39,898
The arsonist died from the drug too.
Her name was on the list.

472
00:31:42,191 --> 00:31:43,401
Is this Dr. Choi?

473
00:31:44,527 --> 00:31:46,070
Why is he smiling like that?

474
00:31:46,154 --> 00:31:47,947
-He's out of it.
-You're handsome.

475
00:31:48,031 --> 00:31:49,449
Why you…

476
00:31:51,659 --> 00:31:53,494
He doesn't seem to be on CTA4885.

477
00:31:53,578 --> 00:31:55,204
Hey, mister.

478
00:31:56,414 --> 00:31:59,292
Hey, did you develop
both the drug and the antidote?

479
00:31:59,375 --> 00:32:00,460
The problem and the solution?

480
00:32:00,543 --> 00:32:03,212
You will never catch Ryu Si-o.

481
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:08,885
You're right. We won't.

482
00:32:09,469 --> 00:32:10,428
It's why…

483
00:32:12,764 --> 00:32:13,932
you'll be the bait.

484
00:32:16,309 --> 00:32:17,226
There.

485
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:20,772
RYU SI-O

486
00:32:20,855 --> 00:32:22,023
Come to Doogo.

487
00:32:22,106 --> 00:32:23,566
GANGHAN POLICE PRECINCT

488
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:24,609
Wait.

489
00:32:26,861 --> 00:32:27,862
Will you be all right?

490
00:32:27,946 --> 00:32:29,447
If I can't get Ryu Si-o,

491
00:32:29,530 --> 00:32:31,074
I'll drag the whole company here.

492
00:32:31,157 --> 00:32:31,991
Don't worry.

493
00:32:32,075 --> 00:32:34,702
They would've already destroyed
any incriminating evidence.

494
00:32:34,786 --> 00:32:36,537
It took us too long to get a warrant.

495
00:32:38,498 --> 00:32:40,041
What about your mom from Mongolia?

496
00:32:40,124 --> 00:32:41,250
Did she board her plane?

497
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:45,296
She's doing some shopping
before catching her red-eye.

498
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:48,132
She's buying liquor for my dad
among other things.

499
00:32:48,716 --> 00:32:50,969
Things were so hectic
that I didn't get to meet her.

500
00:32:51,052 --> 00:32:54,472
You and I should
take a trip there sometime.

501
00:32:54,555 --> 00:32:55,765
To Mongolia.

502
00:32:55,848 --> 00:32:59,644
I'll milk the sheep
and make khorkhog for you.

503
00:33:05,775 --> 00:33:06,776
To be honest,

504
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:08,987
I'm kind of scared.

505
00:33:09,904 --> 00:33:12,448
-Of what?
-That you might get hurt

506
00:33:12,991 --> 00:33:14,367
by Ryu Si-o's rampage.

507
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,705
This is something I have to do.

508
00:33:19,747 --> 00:33:23,543
It was my destiny to come to Korea

509
00:33:23,626 --> 00:33:25,003
and to meet you.

510
00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:30,466
There must be a reason
why I was given this special strength.

511
00:33:31,175 --> 00:33:32,969
I can't lead an ordinary life,

512
00:33:34,345 --> 00:33:36,347
even if it means I'll die.

513
00:33:36,431 --> 00:33:37,932
Why would you say that?

514
00:33:38,016 --> 00:33:39,142
Gan I-sik,

515
00:33:40,309 --> 00:33:41,352
I believe

516
00:33:41,978 --> 00:33:44,105
that divine powers
decide who lives and dies.

517
00:33:44,188 --> 00:33:45,356
No.

518
00:33:46,441 --> 00:33:47,734
You can't die.

519
00:33:48,234 --> 00:33:50,778
Do you think you can
because it's your own life?

520
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:52,113
What about the rest of us?

521
00:33:55,283 --> 00:33:56,951
I never said I would die.

522
00:33:57,535 --> 00:33:58,619
Don't be like that.

523
00:34:04,333 --> 00:34:05,168
Promise me that.

524
00:34:11,007 --> 00:34:12,091
I promise.

525
00:34:30,651 --> 00:34:32,278
What on earth is going on?

526
00:34:32,361 --> 00:34:33,946
Did you resign?

527
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:35,615
Wait.

528
00:34:41,162 --> 00:34:43,122
Mr. Yang said

529
00:34:43,706 --> 00:34:45,416
that you were a spy.

530
00:34:46,167 --> 00:34:47,251
Is that true?

531
00:34:48,628 --> 00:34:50,004
-Yes.
-What?

532
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:53,716
I appreciated your cooperation.

533
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:55,551
Ms. Baek,

534
00:34:55,635 --> 00:34:57,595
the sooner you resign, the better.

535
00:34:58,638 --> 00:35:00,640
That's all I can tell you.

536
00:35:02,809 --> 00:35:03,768
Hillary.

537
00:35:04,602 --> 00:35:06,437
Why are you doing this to me?

538
00:35:07,438 --> 00:35:08,564
Mr. Ryu Si-o

539
00:35:09,565 --> 00:35:10,691
is a Russian mobster.

540
00:35:10,775 --> 00:35:13,694
-What?
-The corporate relations team

541
00:35:14,237 --> 00:35:16,405
has been shipping drugs to Russia.

542
00:35:16,489 --> 00:35:18,950
The puffer jackets are filled with drugs.

543
00:35:19,033 --> 00:35:20,118
What?

544
00:35:20,201 --> 00:35:22,745
You'll soon be summoned for questioning.

545
00:35:23,871 --> 00:35:25,498
As long as you're innocent,
you'll be fine.

546
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:27,041
Even I could tell

547
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:29,794
that you had no knowledge
of the operation.

548
00:35:52,942 --> 00:35:55,361
Ryu's last ace up his sleeve
is the antidote formula.

549
00:35:56,112 --> 00:35:57,947
But it wasn't on the computer you stole,

550
00:35:58,656 --> 00:36:00,700
nor was it in the lab
that you showed to us.

551
00:36:07,456 --> 00:36:09,292
DR. CHOI
COME TO DOOGO

552
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:13,337
The text you received from Russia earlier

553
00:36:13,421 --> 00:36:15,131
was embedded with malware.

554
00:36:18,467 --> 00:36:19,302
You're getting a call.

555
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:33,274
All right. I'll be there.

556
00:36:35,776 --> 00:36:36,903
Gang Nam-soon.

557
00:36:37,862 --> 00:36:38,988
Gang Nam-soon!

558
00:36:48,539 --> 00:36:50,416
This was all her doing.

559
00:36:51,459 --> 00:36:52,960
Gang Nam-soon also took

560
00:36:54,128 --> 00:36:55,129
Dr. Choi.

561
00:36:57,506 --> 00:37:00,968
I want to rip her to pieces.

562
00:37:07,475 --> 00:37:08,392
Got it.

563
00:37:09,268 --> 00:37:10,394
Sir,

564
00:37:10,478 --> 00:37:11,687
everything is set.

565
00:37:27,161 --> 00:37:28,162
Thank you.

566
00:37:29,956 --> 00:37:30,957
Thank you.

567
00:37:37,505 --> 00:37:41,133
I thank you for all you've done
for our daughter Tsetseg.

568
00:37:42,718 --> 00:37:46,514
The years I had with her were a blessing.

569
00:37:46,597 --> 00:37:49,141
I'm the one who should be thanking you.

570
00:37:50,309 --> 00:37:52,853
I will never forget it.

571
00:37:54,146 --> 00:37:54,981
Thank you.

572
00:37:56,148 --> 00:37:57,191
Thank you.

573
00:38:26,929 --> 00:38:30,349
Ex-brother-in-law,
hurry over to the hospital.

574
00:38:30,975 --> 00:38:32,226
I might die.

575
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:34,395
Are you kidding me?

576
00:38:36,939 --> 00:38:38,107
That's way better.

577
00:38:39,483 --> 00:38:40,985
Can I have one too?

578
00:38:41,652 --> 00:38:43,404
All that driving made me dizzy.

579
00:38:43,487 --> 00:38:44,405
I need a sugar rush.

580
00:38:52,872 --> 00:38:53,998
MOM

581
00:38:58,169 --> 00:38:59,295
Ex-brother-in-law.

582
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:03,007
Saying you're tired and you might die
has become a habit of yours.

583
00:39:03,090 --> 00:39:06,135
Shouldn't you suck it up
now that you're over 40?

584
00:39:06,218 --> 00:39:07,219
It's killing me.

585
00:39:07,762 --> 00:39:10,514
Mom went on a trip with that guy.

586
00:39:10,598 --> 00:39:12,516
It makes my blood boil.

587
00:39:14,477 --> 00:39:15,394
Father,

588
00:39:16,187 --> 00:39:18,105
it's time you let Mother be free.

589
00:39:18,189 --> 00:39:19,815
-What?
-Live with me instead.

590
00:39:19,899 --> 00:39:22,568
Why should I live with you
when I have a wife?

591
00:39:22,651 --> 00:39:25,529
-Are you insane?
-You were absent for too long.

592
00:39:25,613 --> 00:39:28,157
Since you say you left us
to find Nam-soon,

593
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:29,241
I'll take responsibility.

594
00:39:29,325 --> 00:39:31,327
Why the hell should I live with you?

595
00:39:31,410 --> 00:39:33,579
Why are you being like this too?

596
00:39:33,662 --> 00:39:34,955
I'm already exhausted.

597
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:37,083
You can live with me too,
ex-brother-in-law.

598
00:39:37,166 --> 00:39:39,543
Let's all live together
under the same roof.

599
00:39:39,627 --> 00:39:42,463
Your father, me, Nam-in, and you.

600
00:39:42,546 --> 00:39:43,714
Us four.

601
00:39:43,798 --> 00:39:45,341
I don't want that.

602
00:39:45,424 --> 00:39:46,384
I really don't.

603
00:39:46,967 --> 00:39:50,554
My life will never improve
if I'm stuck with the three of you.

604
00:40:31,512 --> 00:40:33,973
RYU SI-O

605
00:40:39,395 --> 00:40:40,229
Hello?

606
00:40:42,189 --> 00:40:43,023
Tsetseg.

607
00:40:47,236 --> 00:40:49,405
I mean, Gang Nam-soon.

608
00:40:52,032 --> 00:40:53,075
We should meet

609
00:40:54,243 --> 00:40:55,661
at some place other than Doogo.

610
00:40:56,829 --> 00:40:59,665
It's all over now, so turn yourself in.

611
00:41:06,005 --> 00:41:09,008
Your mom from Mongolia
wouldn't turn down a free gift.

612
00:41:10,468 --> 00:41:13,637
When you stole from the warehouse
looking for the drugs,

613
00:41:14,430 --> 00:41:16,390
you spoke of your parents.

614
00:41:16,474 --> 00:41:17,641
That's when I thought

615
00:41:19,059 --> 00:41:20,060
that you were

616
00:41:21,270 --> 00:41:22,605
a sweet daughter.

617
00:41:24,773 --> 00:41:26,233
Even though you found your birth mother,

618
00:41:27,193 --> 00:41:30,237
are your adoptive parents
still precious to you?

619
00:41:31,739 --> 00:41:33,240
What are you getting at?

620
00:41:34,450 --> 00:41:36,994
-What did you to--
-Come to the address I just sent you.

621
00:41:38,078 --> 00:41:39,622
If I see the police, your mom…

622
00:41:41,415 --> 00:41:42,458
will die.

623
00:42:08,484 --> 00:42:09,735
I'll go with you.

624
00:42:09,818 --> 00:42:10,653
No.

625
00:42:11,278 --> 00:42:12,488
Let me come with you.

626
00:42:13,405 --> 00:42:14,823
I have to go alone.

627
00:42:15,449 --> 00:42:16,825
No, I can't allow that.

628
00:42:16,909 --> 00:42:18,494
If you come with me, my mom…

629
00:42:20,579 --> 00:42:21,705
She'll be in danger.

630
00:42:23,832 --> 00:42:26,252
I think Ryu Si-o got to her somehow.

631
00:42:29,004 --> 00:42:29,838
I'm sorry.

632
00:42:31,590 --> 00:42:32,758
I'm going alone.

633
00:42:55,281 --> 00:42:57,032
I have Yeom Su-san's location.

634
00:42:57,116 --> 00:42:59,201
It's Unit A-303 at Techville in Yongsan.

635
00:43:23,350 --> 00:43:25,185
It's been a while, Ms. Hwang.

636
00:43:28,188 --> 00:43:29,898
Fancy seeing you here.

637
00:43:34,612 --> 00:43:35,779
Do you have a death wish?

638
00:43:35,863 --> 00:43:36,822
Su-san,

639
00:43:37,406 --> 00:43:40,200
I don't care how sweet money can be.

640
00:43:40,701 --> 00:43:44,663
It's still wrong
to join forces with druggies.

641
00:43:44,747 --> 00:43:47,207
-What?
-Where's Bread Song?

642
00:43:47,291 --> 00:43:49,293
As if I'd know.

643
00:44:14,735 --> 00:44:16,862
Haven't you heard?

644
00:44:19,698 --> 00:44:20,866
My mom and I

645
00:44:21,533 --> 00:44:24,745
made our fortune
by crushing ox bones for a living.

646
00:44:28,916 --> 00:44:30,042
Where is

647
00:44:30,959 --> 00:44:31,960
Bread Song?

648
00:44:32,461 --> 00:44:34,755
Some crazy lady wreaked havoc on us.

649
00:44:34,838 --> 00:44:36,382
She's super strong.

650
00:44:47,017 --> 00:44:47,893
Ms. Hwang?

651
00:44:55,484 --> 00:44:58,070
Return the money you conned
from those wealthy ladies.

652
00:44:59,071 --> 00:45:01,365
All of it, down to every last cent.

653
00:45:01,448 --> 00:45:03,784
I never took any of it for myself.

654
00:45:03,867 --> 00:45:05,661
In fact, I doubled and tripled it.

655
00:45:05,744 --> 00:45:07,162
That was part of the plan.

656
00:45:07,746 --> 00:45:09,748
Only then would they bring
more money to you.

657
00:45:10,791 --> 00:45:13,168
You were only pretending
to create shell corporations

658
00:45:13,252 --> 00:45:14,962
under borrowed names

659
00:45:15,671 --> 00:45:18,215
so that you could steal their money
in the process.

660
00:45:18,799 --> 00:45:21,802
Gangnam's loaded ladies
invested their black money in you.

661
00:45:22,344 --> 00:45:23,762
So you knew

662
00:45:24,805 --> 00:45:26,598
they wouldn't be able to press charges.

663
00:45:31,145 --> 00:45:32,312
Ms. Hwang.

664
00:45:34,106 --> 00:45:36,942
Don't be like this
and just tell me what you want.

665
00:45:37,025 --> 00:45:38,193
What I want?

666
00:45:39,403 --> 00:45:40,946
I want to know who you really are.

667
00:45:44,658 --> 00:45:46,493
You were in the photo with Ryu Si-o

668
00:45:47,411 --> 00:45:49,705
and have been meeting with Yeom Su-san.

669
00:45:50,497 --> 00:45:53,167
Who the hell are you?

670
00:45:54,293 --> 00:45:56,378
I ask that for the 31st time.

671
00:45:57,588 --> 00:45:59,673
Who the hell are you?

672
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:06,513
She just entered the abandoned factory.

673
00:46:10,684 --> 00:46:11,810
I can't take this.

674
00:46:11,894 --> 00:46:13,270
I'm going there. I have to.

675
00:46:13,353 --> 00:46:15,397
Hee-sik, I'll update you
with the coordinates.

676
00:46:16,690 --> 00:46:18,609
-I'll come with you.
-No, I'll go alone.

677
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:27,618
Let's request backup
and just arrest Ryu Si-o.

678
00:46:27,701 --> 00:46:30,787
No, it'll put Agent Gang in danger.
She's already his hostage.

679
00:46:30,871 --> 00:46:31,914
Let it be just us then.

680
00:46:31,997 --> 00:46:33,207
We can't let him go on his own.

681
00:46:33,290 --> 00:46:34,917
Damn it.

682
00:46:35,626 --> 00:46:36,793
Fine. Let's go.

683
00:46:36,877 --> 00:46:38,504
Stay here and keep tracking her.

684
00:46:38,587 --> 00:46:40,047
I'll keep you updated.

685
00:46:43,467 --> 00:46:44,760
Ryu Si-o, show yourself!

686
00:46:48,847 --> 00:46:50,182
That was fast.

687
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:01,610
What do you want?

688
00:47:02,694 --> 00:47:04,863
As your partner who once opened up to you,

689
00:47:07,032 --> 00:47:08,867
I'd like to conduct one final test.

690
00:47:20,170 --> 00:47:21,630
My drug

691
00:47:21,713 --> 00:47:24,299
versus the love you have
for your Mongolian mother.

692
00:47:25,634 --> 00:47:26,885
I wonder which is stronger.

693
00:47:27,719 --> 00:47:29,846
What did you do to my mom?

694
00:47:33,976 --> 00:47:35,018
Your mom…

695
00:47:36,353 --> 00:47:37,688
has a bomb on her.

696
00:47:45,904 --> 00:47:48,532
If you don't drink water for an hour
after taking the drug,

697
00:47:49,074 --> 00:47:50,450
the bomb won't go off.

698
00:47:51,285 --> 00:47:54,788
The water bottle is sitting
on top of a bomb trigger.

699
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:04,923
You should know

700
00:48:05,591 --> 00:48:08,635
that if you so much as
touch the water bottle,

701
00:48:09,177 --> 00:48:10,554
the sensor will be triggered.

702
00:48:12,097 --> 00:48:15,183
In other words, the bomb will go off
if you drink the water.

703
00:48:17,269 --> 00:48:18,645
Then your mom…

704
00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:22,357
as well as all those near her, will die.

705
00:48:24,651 --> 00:48:25,569
How about it?

706
00:48:26,737 --> 00:48:27,821
Doable, right?

707
00:48:29,906 --> 00:48:32,159
I specifically told you
to leave the others alone.

708
00:48:36,121 --> 00:48:38,081
I'm the one who makes the decisions.

709
00:48:39,166 --> 00:48:40,959
All you can do now is choose.

710
00:48:42,461 --> 00:48:44,171
If I hold out for an hour…

711
00:48:46,131 --> 00:48:47,633
If I overcome this drug,

712
00:48:48,592 --> 00:48:49,593
Ryu Si-o,

713
00:48:50,344 --> 00:48:51,803
admit your defeat.

714
00:48:51,887 --> 00:48:53,472
And pay for your sins.

715
00:48:54,765 --> 00:48:55,849
How about it?

716
00:48:56,350 --> 00:48:57,601
Doable, right?

717
00:49:00,896 --> 00:49:01,730
Fine.

718
00:49:02,731 --> 00:49:03,607
Bring it.

719
00:49:36,139 --> 00:49:38,684
The drug you took
will kill you within an hour.

720
00:49:39,226 --> 00:49:40,268
The burning thirst

721
00:49:41,228 --> 00:49:42,688
might make your heart explode.

722
00:49:50,195 --> 00:49:51,113
You

723
00:49:51,822 --> 00:49:52,989
and your Mongolian mom…

724
00:49:56,910 --> 00:49:57,994
will both die.

725
00:51:03,018 --> 00:51:04,102
Ms. Hwang,

726
00:51:05,228 --> 00:51:06,938
why don't you leave with me?

727
00:51:08,774 --> 00:51:10,734
If the two of us

728
00:51:12,235 --> 00:51:13,612
were to combine forces…

729
00:51:43,892 --> 00:51:44,976
MS. HWANG GEUM-JU

730
00:51:45,060 --> 00:51:46,061
Hello?

731
00:51:46,144 --> 00:51:47,187
Inspector Kang!

732
00:51:48,396 --> 00:51:49,356
It's bad.

733
00:51:49,898 --> 00:51:52,526
Nam-soon…

734
00:52:07,374 --> 00:52:08,667
Nam-soon!

735
00:52:09,251 --> 00:52:10,460
Nam-soon!

736
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:01,970
Your daughter

737
00:53:03,388 --> 00:53:04,222
will die.

738
00:53:06,266 --> 00:53:07,767
She can't drink water.

739
00:53:22,616 --> 00:53:23,450
Nam-soon…

740
00:54:56,334 --> 00:54:58,253
-What a sight.
-I know.

741
00:55:00,505 --> 00:55:01,589
Jun-hee.

742
00:55:04,175 --> 00:55:05,593
What did you wish for?

743
00:55:10,473 --> 00:55:11,516
I wished

744
00:55:12,017 --> 00:55:14,602
for a lifetime of happiness with you.

745
00:55:14,686 --> 00:55:16,438
Gosh, so did I.

746
00:55:23,319 --> 00:55:24,320
Joong-gan?

747
00:55:34,873 --> 00:55:36,624
Joong-gan, are you all right?

748
00:55:53,975 --> 00:55:55,185
What's going on?

749
00:55:55,268 --> 00:55:59,272
Mom, Nam-soon's in trouble.

750
00:56:00,732 --> 00:56:02,150
What is it?

751
00:56:02,233 --> 00:56:03,651
Stop crying

752
00:56:03,735 --> 00:56:05,487
and tell me what's going on.

753
00:56:06,654 --> 00:56:08,990
I think he drugged Nam-soon.

754
00:56:09,574 --> 00:56:11,451
She'll die if she doesn't drink water.

755
00:56:11,534 --> 00:56:15,830
I've been drinking water
to wake her up through our connection,

756
00:56:15,914 --> 00:56:17,916
but she still isn't responding.

757
00:56:21,419 --> 00:56:22,629
We only get connected

758
00:56:24,339 --> 00:56:25,840
when one of us uses our strength.

759
00:56:27,759 --> 00:56:29,010
Where's Nam-soon?

760
00:56:29,094 --> 00:56:30,428
I don't know.

761
00:56:31,638 --> 00:56:33,598
You must've felt it too.

762
00:56:34,474 --> 00:56:35,892
If we don't do something,

763
00:56:35,975 --> 00:56:38,561
Nam-soon will die!

764
00:56:40,021 --> 00:56:40,855
I'll handle this.

765
00:56:41,606 --> 00:56:42,524
Don't worry.

766
00:56:44,734 --> 00:56:45,568
I'll…

767
00:56:46,986 --> 00:56:48,113
wake her up.

768
00:56:55,495 --> 00:56:56,788
Joong-gan?

769
00:56:57,956 --> 00:56:58,957
Jun-hee.

770
00:57:00,667 --> 00:57:03,962
Please listen carefully
to what I'm about to say.

771
00:57:06,589 --> 00:57:07,590
Today,

772
00:57:09,717 --> 00:57:11,594
I will be wielding

773
00:57:12,470 --> 00:57:14,389
a level of power
I have never spent before.

774
00:57:15,723 --> 00:57:16,891
I must give it my all,

775
00:57:17,684 --> 00:57:18,977
and that…

776
00:57:21,146 --> 00:57:22,397
could actually kill me.

777
00:57:28,778 --> 00:57:29,988
However,

778
00:57:32,449 --> 00:57:34,075
please know this one thing.

779
00:57:38,163 --> 00:57:39,789
Never have I loved a man…

780
00:57:42,750 --> 00:57:44,794
like I loved you.

781
00:57:49,257 --> 00:57:51,718
You loved me
from the bottom of your heart,

782
00:57:55,263 --> 00:57:56,764
and that is enough for me.

783
00:58:01,519 --> 00:58:02,687
I love you.

784
00:58:04,939 --> 00:58:05,982
Joong-gan.

785
00:58:06,900 --> 00:58:08,193
Don't come after me!

786
00:58:09,903 --> 00:58:11,404
It's too dangerous.

787
00:58:13,114 --> 00:58:14,699
It's my problem to solve.

788
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:18,786
Joong-gan…

789
00:58:35,094 --> 00:58:36,012
Let me

790
00:58:37,263 --> 00:58:38,473
save my family

791
00:58:39,349 --> 00:58:40,892
with my life.

792
00:59:29,732 --> 00:59:30,942
Nam-soon.

793
00:59:33,528 --> 00:59:36,447
Wake up!

794
01:00:21,951 --> 01:00:25,580
EPISODE 15
STRONG GIRL NAM-SOON

795
01:00:59,364 --> 01:01:01,741
STRONG GIRL NAM-SOON

796
01:01:01,824 --> 01:01:04,035
Joong-gan, please hang in there.

797
01:01:04,118 --> 01:01:06,329
Just please come back to me.

798
01:01:06,412 --> 01:01:08,748
It opened up a crack
in Pavel's Asian division.

799
01:01:08,831 --> 01:01:10,792
Information usually leaks through cracks.

800
01:01:10,875 --> 01:01:12,126
You must watch your back.

801
01:01:12,210 --> 01:01:14,754
Nozh has you as his next target.

802
01:01:14,837 --> 01:01:15,880
Just you wait.

803
01:01:15,963 --> 01:01:17,423
I'll kill you myself.

804
01:01:17,507 --> 01:01:19,967
We're not the only party
hunting for Ryu Si-o.

805
01:01:20,051 --> 01:01:21,552
We must find it first.

806
01:01:21,636 --> 01:01:25,223
I must beat it out of that lab rat.

807
01:01:25,306 --> 01:01:27,600
It's over. Ryu Si-o, surrender!

808
01:01:27,684 --> 01:01:29,644
"Die with dignity."

809
01:01:29,727 --> 01:01:31,020
Ryu Si-o, no!

810
01:01:33,606 --> 01:01:38,611
