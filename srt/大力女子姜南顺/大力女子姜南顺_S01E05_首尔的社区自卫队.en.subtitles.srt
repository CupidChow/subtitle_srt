1
00:00:42,667 --> 00:00:45,962
STRONG GIRL NAM-SOON

2
00:01:01,478 --> 00:01:04,981
EPISODE 5
VIGILANTE OF SEOUL

3
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:23,041
Power will go out

4
00:01:23,124 --> 00:01:24,918
in three, two, one.

5
00:01:25,001 --> 00:01:26,252
You have five minutes.

6
00:01:26,336 --> 00:01:28,421
After that,
the backup generator will kick in.

7
00:01:28,505 --> 00:01:29,339
Okay.

8
00:01:40,016 --> 00:01:40,850
Here.

9
00:01:43,853 --> 00:01:45,980
You don't even need night vision goggles?

10
00:01:46,064 --> 00:01:47,315
What the hell are you?

11
00:01:55,073 --> 00:01:56,574
Hey, brother.

12
00:01:56,658 --> 00:01:58,743
The masks are up there.

13
00:02:02,413 --> 00:02:03,331
Where?

14
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:33,653
What?

15
00:02:34,237 --> 00:02:35,446
It beeped.

16
00:02:37,907 --> 00:02:39,784
You have two minutes. Hurry up.

17
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:48,543
We're short on time.

18
00:02:50,378 --> 00:02:53,172
I'm not in some kind of metaverse, am I?

19
00:02:53,256 --> 00:02:55,341
This is the real world, right?

20
00:02:56,759 --> 00:02:58,595
Come on. Pass that here.

21
00:03:22,493 --> 00:03:23,786
-Are you okay?
-I'm good.

22
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:27,165
I'm not hurt, but…

23
00:03:27,248 --> 00:03:28,958
-Let me take a look.
-It's all right.

24
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:31,711
Hee-sik, come on.
You have 50 seconds left.

25
00:03:32,253 --> 00:03:33,254
Okay.

26
00:03:34,797 --> 00:03:35,924
Let's hurry out.

27
00:03:51,773 --> 00:03:55,109
I knew it was a bad idea
to take Nam-soon in there.

28
00:03:55,193 --> 00:03:56,402
Did she get hurt?

29
00:04:27,725 --> 00:04:28,935
-Drive.
-Right.

30
00:04:29,018 --> 00:04:31,562
I can't believe a woman carried me out.

31
00:04:32,063 --> 00:04:33,189
This can't be.

32
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:34,565
You fell because of me.

33
00:04:34,649 --> 00:04:35,775
It's the least I can do.

34
00:04:35,858 --> 00:04:38,111
I know the ger incident
proved your strength,

35
00:04:38,194 --> 00:04:39,529
but seeing you in action…

36
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:41,447
Gosh, it was impressive.

37
00:04:42,031 --> 00:04:44,033
Gan I-sik is as light as a feather.

38
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:46,869
And just like that, I became a feather.

39
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:48,496
-Drive, will you?
-Got it.

40
00:06:00,943 --> 00:06:02,779
Please come to Incheon Port immediately.

41
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:04,822
We are preparing dinner for you.

42
00:07:39,375 --> 00:07:40,543
You.

43
00:07:40,626 --> 00:07:43,171
You're the one who gave me
the business card at Heritage.

44
00:07:43,254 --> 00:07:44,088
That's right.

45
00:07:44,172 --> 00:07:45,590
You followed me.

46
00:07:46,591 --> 00:07:47,592
Why?

47
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:55,600
I introduced you to Opulentia, didn't I?

48
00:07:56,726 --> 00:07:57,977
That's why I followed you.

49
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:21,626
Wait.

50
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:24,378
It's that way.

51
00:08:31,093 --> 00:08:32,094
But…

52
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:33,596
That wasn't it?

53
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:46,317
He's the vice chairman of Opulentia.

54
00:08:50,863 --> 00:08:54,784
Why is the vice chairman here
roleplaying as a restaurant owner?

55
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:57,078
Stir-fried chicken gizzards.

56
00:08:57,828 --> 00:08:59,038
So freakin' good.

57
00:09:00,915 --> 00:09:02,542
How about some chicken feet?

58
00:09:40,997 --> 00:09:42,498
Try the chicken gizzards.

59
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:51,799
So freakin' good.

60
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:59,599
That is a purpose I can get behind.

61
00:09:59,682 --> 00:10:02,476
It's not easy to come across
those who share my vision.

62
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:04,937
I knew it.

63
00:10:05,021 --> 00:10:06,772
I was right.

64
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:09,609
We have access to
a vast amount of data and intelligence.

65
00:10:09,692 --> 00:10:11,027
With the capital we have,

66
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:13,362
we could hire any retiree
from the CIA, the FBI,

67
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:15,615
the British SIS, and the Russian Mint,

68
00:10:15,698 --> 00:10:18,743
as well as members of both
legal and illegal powerful organizations.

69
00:10:18,826 --> 00:10:23,080
So you've been trying to figure out
who I truly am.

70
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:28,294
We've been searching for someone
who truly knows how to spend their money,

71
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:30,338
and that's how we chose you.

72
00:10:30,421 --> 00:10:31,839
I look forward

73
00:10:32,798 --> 00:10:34,383
to working with you.

74
00:10:42,266 --> 00:10:43,768
Cheers!

75
00:10:43,851 --> 00:10:45,686
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

76
00:10:57,073 --> 00:10:58,366
Great work today. Get some rest.

77
00:10:58,449 --> 00:10:59,909
You too, kid.

78
00:11:01,744 --> 00:11:02,578
Right.

79
00:11:05,289 --> 00:11:06,540
See you.

80
00:11:11,253 --> 00:11:13,047
Hang on. I should walk her home.

81
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:14,674
It's dark and dangerous outside.

82
00:11:14,757 --> 00:11:15,883
Go on without me.

83
00:11:19,845 --> 00:11:21,597
Talk about not knowing his place.

84
00:11:22,306 --> 00:11:24,475
She should be the one
walking him home instead.

85
00:11:26,602 --> 00:11:27,645
Nam-soon.

86
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:30,231
I'll walk you home.

87
00:11:30,731 --> 00:11:32,983
You don't need to.
I live right over there.

88
00:11:33,567 --> 00:11:35,569
Still, it's dangerous at night.

89
00:11:36,612 --> 00:11:39,949
There could be wolves and foxes.

90
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:42,910
Shoo.

91
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:46,288
Good job today. I appreciate the help.

92
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,041
It was fun.

93
00:11:49,667 --> 00:11:54,422
Besides, I'll do anything
if it can help you or the world.

94
00:11:55,673 --> 00:11:56,632
It did help.

95
00:12:01,011 --> 00:12:02,430
Bye, brother.

96
00:12:03,931 --> 00:12:04,974
Also,

97
00:12:05,683 --> 00:12:08,769
try speaking a bit more formally.

98
00:12:09,603 --> 00:12:11,480
-Try, "Goodbye."
-Yo, brother.

99
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:24,326
-You're back, Ms. Nam-soon.
-Yeah.

100
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:26,620
I mean, yes.

101
00:12:27,788 --> 00:12:30,082
Where's my mom, Ms. Jung?

102
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:31,917
She had an important meeting.

103
00:12:32,001 --> 00:12:34,003
She'll probably be home soon.

104
00:12:36,005 --> 00:12:38,090
She's in Incheon at the moment.

105
00:12:38,674 --> 00:12:39,717
I see.

106
00:12:41,552 --> 00:12:43,804
I will head to my room.

107
00:12:43,888 --> 00:12:45,181
Good night, Ms. Jung.

108
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:46,724
Good night.

109
00:12:51,562 --> 00:12:52,605
Where do you live?

110
00:12:52,688 --> 00:12:53,522
You're beautiful.

111
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:55,357
How about going for a drive?

112
00:12:56,734 --> 00:12:57,735
The match of the day.

113
00:12:57,818 --> 00:12:59,069
MATCH OF THE DAY!
POLLOCK

114
00:12:59,153 --> 00:13:00,988
No way. Hwang Geum-dong?

115
00:13:01,572 --> 00:13:03,157
Are you kidding me?

116
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:04,867
Damn it.

117
00:13:07,912 --> 00:13:09,079
Wait, my photo.

118
00:13:09,705 --> 00:13:11,081
DELETE CURRENT PHOTO?
CONFIRM

119
00:13:11,165 --> 00:13:12,500
VIVID

120
00:13:13,584 --> 00:13:14,919
CUTIES

121
00:13:19,256 --> 00:13:20,216
You know,

122
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:23,886
you're gradually losing your place
in my heart.

123
00:13:25,429 --> 00:13:26,597
It's weird.

124
00:13:27,181 --> 00:13:30,142
You don't seem as cool as you used to be.

125
00:13:32,019 --> 00:13:33,395
I wonder why.

126
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:38,400
Do you guys know the reason?

127
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:40,986
GAN I-SIK

128
00:13:45,366 --> 00:13:47,618
Wash your hands well
since you touched the masks.

129
00:13:48,202 --> 00:13:49,328
Good night.

130
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:55,501
I think…

131
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:57,836
I know why.

132
00:14:01,298 --> 00:14:02,841
I can't take it!

133
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:22,361
GANGHAN POLICE PRECINCT

134
00:14:22,444 --> 00:14:23,612
Send it to the NFS.

135
00:14:24,196 --> 00:14:25,698
Hee-sik went to Doogo.

136
00:14:26,448 --> 00:14:28,450
He came back with all types of masks.

137
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:29,869
Could these really be drugs?

138
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:31,954
I know, right? I'm just as baffled.

139
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:34,874
Hey, you know Gang Nam-soon

140
00:14:34,957 --> 00:14:36,667
-from the ger fight?
-The strong girl?

141
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:39,336
You wouldn't believe how strong she is.

142
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:42,172
She ran with Hee-sik in her arms.

143
00:14:42,256 --> 00:14:44,258
My friend over at
Gangnam Police Station told me

144
00:14:44,341 --> 00:14:45,634
about an academy building fire.

145
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:48,512
One girl apparently jumped
all the way to the fourth floor.

146
00:14:48,596 --> 00:14:50,890
As if. This isn't some Marvel movie.

147
00:14:50,973 --> 00:14:52,892
It's true. There are even photos
taken at the scene.

148
00:14:52,975 --> 00:14:55,519
I bet they're fake.
Anything can be photoshopped these days.

149
00:14:55,603 --> 00:14:58,147
They weren't. Now hear this.

150
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:00,816
The mother of that flying woman
owns Geumju Daily

151
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:01,942
and is super rich.

152
00:15:02,026 --> 00:15:03,068
She's a trillionaire.

153
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:06,322
Anyway, her mom stopped
those articles from being published,

154
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:07,531
hence the lack of reports.

155
00:15:07,615 --> 00:15:11,076
Are you saying that the ger girl
is also the flying one?

156
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,244
-No, right?
-Yes.

157
00:15:12,328 --> 00:15:13,329
She's her.

158
00:15:14,288 --> 00:15:16,415
She'll put Wonder Woman to shame.

159
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:19,335
But is it true?
Do you believe any of this?

160
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:21,086
Come on, Chamma.

161
00:15:22,046 --> 00:15:25,883
The mom finally found her
after searching for 20 years.

162
00:15:25,966 --> 00:15:28,636
But during that time,
an impostor showed up.

163
00:15:28,719 --> 00:15:31,764
LEE MYUNG-HEE WANTED FOR FRAUD
REWARD UP TO 5 MILLION WON

164
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:35,225
-We're back.
-We're back.

165
00:15:39,188 --> 00:15:40,356
This is Ganghan Police Precinct.

166
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:42,399
I'm calling about Ri Hwa-ja.

167
00:15:42,483 --> 00:15:43,859
I'd like to report a sighting.

168
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:48,864
Yes, I'm sure of it.

169
00:15:50,491 --> 00:15:52,368
Ri Hwa-ja, the fraud at large.

170
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:55,746
She's brazenly working here
as a delivery woman.

171
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:57,373
By the way,

172
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:01,210
how much would I get for the tip-off?

173
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:03,337
Where exactly did you see the suspect?

174
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:05,005
I'm at Doogo…

175
00:16:07,758 --> 00:16:08,634
Hello?

176
00:16:08,717 --> 00:16:09,802
Hello?

177
00:16:11,845 --> 00:16:15,349
Shouldn't my working here
despite being wanted by the police

178
00:16:15,432 --> 00:16:17,267
be a dead giveaway?

179
00:16:18,102 --> 00:16:20,646
I have nothing more to lose.

180
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:23,440
Anyone who gets in my way

181
00:16:24,358 --> 00:16:26,402
will be done for.

182
00:16:27,611 --> 00:16:30,656
You've been eyeing me for some time now.

183
00:16:32,783 --> 00:16:33,909
Did you think I wouldn't notice?

184
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:37,162
Keep sticking your nose
where it doesn't belong,

185
00:16:37,955 --> 00:16:41,208
and I'll remove all your organs
to send them for delivery.

186
00:16:42,376 --> 00:16:44,503
I'll put them in an icebox.

187
00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:47,256
They should be kept fresh, after all.

188
00:16:50,467 --> 00:16:51,719
I'll even…

189
00:16:56,724 --> 00:16:58,267
deliver them myself.

190
00:17:05,607 --> 00:17:06,734
Hi!

191
00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:36,388
Hey, Young-tak.

192
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:39,183
Can you call me
as soon as the NFS gets back to us

193
00:17:39,266 --> 00:17:40,517
regarding the masks?

194
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:42,227
I'll head back as soon as I'm done.

195
00:17:42,311 --> 00:17:43,145
Got it.

196
00:17:45,647 --> 00:17:47,733
-This is Kang Hee-sik.
-Inspector Kang,

197
00:17:47,816 --> 00:17:49,485
this is Yeo Ji-hyeon.

198
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:52,154
It's about Lee Myung-hee,
Gang Nam-soon's impostor.

199
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:53,739
Someone called saying he saw her.

200
00:17:53,822 --> 00:17:55,115
Is that so?

201
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:57,076
We should verify the tip and arrest her.

202
00:17:57,159 --> 00:17:59,203
The call got disconnected,

203
00:17:59,286 --> 00:18:02,289
but the caller said she was at Doogo.

204
00:18:02,372 --> 00:18:04,208
-Doogo?
-Yes.

205
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:09,546
Does every road lead to Doogo or what?

206
00:18:10,714 --> 00:18:11,840
Officer Yeo,

207
00:18:12,508 --> 00:18:14,968
could you get me a detailed file on her?

208
00:18:15,052 --> 00:18:16,720
I requested some information

209
00:18:16,804 --> 00:18:18,555
from Senior Inspector Oh of Team 3.

210
00:18:18,639 --> 00:18:20,974
I'm looking into her
using my own connections,

211
00:18:21,058 --> 00:18:23,393
so you can just focus on the drug case.

212
00:18:23,477 --> 00:18:25,437
Got it, thank you.

213
00:18:27,022 --> 00:18:29,566
We'll talk again
when I get back to the precinct.

214
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:30,984
Sure.

215
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:32,528
Good luck.

216
00:18:36,573 --> 00:18:37,407
What's going on?

217
00:18:38,909 --> 00:18:41,036
If she truly is at Doogo…

218
00:18:41,537 --> 00:18:43,539
did she follow Nam-soon there?

219
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:45,833
But why?

220
00:18:47,084 --> 00:18:48,001
Doberman, it's me.

221
00:18:49,336 --> 00:18:51,547
Gang Nam-soon is at Doogo.

222
00:18:53,048 --> 00:18:54,466
I'm serious.

223
00:18:55,008 --> 00:18:56,343
She's a delivery person.

224
00:18:56,426 --> 00:19:00,013
She should be living the good life
thanks to her billionaire mom.

225
00:19:00,097 --> 00:19:01,598
Why is she working there?

226
00:19:01,682 --> 00:19:03,100
That's what I want to know too.

227
00:19:03,183 --> 00:19:05,894
What the hell is she doing here?

228
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:09,606
Was she another impostor
who got kicked out, or…

229
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,318
maybe something else is going on?

230
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:15,529
I'm not going anywhere near her,

231
00:19:15,612 --> 00:19:17,573
no matter how much you pay me.

232
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:20,117
She's not your average girl.

233
00:19:21,285 --> 00:19:23,912
I genuinely want to kill her

234
00:19:25,747 --> 00:19:26,915
more than anything.

235
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:31,044
It would've all been mine
if she hadn't shown up.

236
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:34,548
She pisses me off.

237
00:19:36,967 --> 00:19:37,801
By the way,

238
00:19:38,552 --> 00:19:41,263
some bastard recognized me
and reported me to the police.

239
00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:43,891
I told you that you shouldn't
be working there.

240
00:19:43,974 --> 00:19:45,559
You need to get out of there.

241
00:19:45,642 --> 00:19:48,103
The cops are all over the place
looking for you.

242
00:19:48,687 --> 00:19:49,688
I'm…

243
00:19:52,149 --> 00:19:54,276
going to kill them all,

244
00:19:55,819 --> 00:19:57,905
starting with Gang Nam-soon.

245
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:17,132
Tsetseg.

246
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:18,634
Yeah, what is it?

247
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:20,719
Why isn't Jun-seok at work today?

248
00:20:20,802 --> 00:20:22,095
He's on his way.

249
00:20:22,179 --> 00:20:25,140
He's taking advantage of you
just because you're strong, isn't he?

250
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:28,602
Aren't you taking advantage of us
just because you're our superior?

251
00:20:28,685 --> 00:20:30,270
Don't be like that.

252
00:20:30,354 --> 00:20:32,522
All I want is for us to get along.

253
00:20:33,106 --> 00:20:34,358
Let's…

254
00:20:34,441 --> 00:20:35,609
be friends.

255
00:20:35,692 --> 00:20:36,944
Sure.

256
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:38,487
Whatever.

257
00:20:40,322 --> 00:20:42,908
By the way, Tsetseg,

258
00:20:42,991 --> 00:20:48,205
what did you eat in Mongolia
to make you this strong?

259
00:20:52,417 --> 00:20:53,543
It's a secret.

260
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:55,170
You can tell me.

261
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:57,339
My lips are sealed.

262
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:00,926
I eat…

263
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:03,971
100 eggs a day.

264
00:21:04,054 --> 00:21:05,722
-100 eggs?
-Yes.

265
00:21:05,806 --> 00:21:08,976
Really? 100 eggs?

266
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:10,060
Yes.

267
00:21:10,143 --> 00:21:13,438
And they must be consumed raw.

268
00:21:13,522 --> 00:21:15,232
Not fried or boiled

269
00:21:15,315 --> 00:21:16,775
-but 100 raw eggs?
-Yes.

270
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:20,320
Whatever I eat, I eat it raw.

271
00:21:20,404 --> 00:21:22,948
Raw chicken and raw pork.

272
00:21:23,907 --> 00:21:25,659
That's your secret?

273
00:21:25,742 --> 00:21:26,702
Yes.

274
00:21:28,745 --> 00:21:30,038
Don't tell anyone though.

275
00:21:31,373 --> 00:21:33,208
They'll laugh at you

276
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:34,751
because they'll think you made it up.

277
00:21:34,835 --> 00:21:37,587
Why would I spill something
this top secret?

278
00:21:38,171 --> 00:21:40,507
This knowledge is almost
too much to bear alone.

279
00:21:49,349 --> 00:21:51,601
Eat raw food.

280
00:21:53,395 --> 00:21:54,438
Raw food.

281
00:21:55,355 --> 00:21:56,398
Raw food.

282
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:23,425
Ma'am, Ms. Cho from Seowon
is waiting for you.

283
00:22:23,508 --> 00:22:25,010
What brings her here?

284
00:22:26,553 --> 00:22:27,512
I'm not sure.

285
00:22:27,596 --> 00:22:29,848
I doubt she's in need of money,

286
00:22:29,931 --> 00:22:31,058
so I wonder why.

287
00:22:33,977 --> 00:22:36,396
To what do I owe the pleasure, Ms. Cho?

288
00:22:39,775 --> 00:22:40,984
It's been a while.

289
00:22:41,735 --> 00:22:42,819
Hardly.

290
00:22:43,403 --> 00:22:44,946
We met at the Heritage Club party.

291
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:47,449
Right, of course.

292
00:22:51,036 --> 00:22:51,995
This…

293
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:53,955
is a ten-carat blue diamond.

294
00:22:57,667 --> 00:22:59,920
I see. And?

295
00:23:00,003 --> 00:23:01,129
It'll be collateral

296
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:02,297
for three big ones.

297
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:05,300
It's a custom-made Rothermere diamond.

298
00:23:05,383 --> 00:23:07,761
My husband bought it
for five billion won at the time

299
00:23:07,844 --> 00:23:10,305
to celebrate our 30th wedding anniversary.

300
00:23:10,388 --> 00:23:12,390
Why do you suddenly need that money?

301
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:16,728
You coming to me
means you're in urgent need of it.

302
00:23:16,812 --> 00:23:21,233
Or maybe you need money
to spend under your husband's radar.

303
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:23,568
Do you really need to know?

304
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:25,153
Of course.

305
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,032
Don't you know Gold Blue's principle?

306
00:23:29,116 --> 00:23:32,244
"The borrowed money
must be spent on something meaningful."

307
00:23:34,162 --> 00:23:35,705
Please don't tell me it's for drugs.

308
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:39,918
Don't be ridiculous.

309
00:23:40,001 --> 00:23:42,087
Then tell me what it's for.

310
00:23:44,131 --> 00:23:45,465
I must know.

311
00:24:03,942 --> 00:24:05,193
We received a tip.

312
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:06,319
Regarding what?

313
00:24:06,403 --> 00:24:08,196
Ri Hwa-ja is at Doogo.

314
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:11,199
The woman who tried to kill you
was seen at Doogo.

315
00:24:12,659 --> 00:24:15,328
Really? I can't wait to meet her.

316
00:24:15,954 --> 00:24:18,331
Why are you excited?
She's not your long-lost friend.

317
00:24:19,332 --> 00:24:21,042
We have to catch her, not meet her.

318
00:24:21,126 --> 00:24:23,170
Then what? Throw her in prison?

319
00:24:23,253 --> 00:24:25,714
Of course. She committed a heinous crime.

320
00:24:26,673 --> 00:24:28,258
My mom wouldn't want that.

321
00:24:28,967 --> 00:24:30,468
My mom said

322
00:24:30,552 --> 00:24:32,429
that people can change.

323
00:24:33,763 --> 00:24:35,390
People don't change that easily.

324
00:24:35,473 --> 00:24:37,851
My mom disagrees.

325
00:24:38,518 --> 00:24:40,187
She ran off with your watches

326
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:41,813
and tried to kill our daughter.

327
00:24:41,897 --> 00:24:43,231
I can never forgive her.

328
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:44,691
I'll hear her out first

329
00:24:44,774 --> 00:24:47,360
and deal with her myself if I have to.

330
00:24:47,444 --> 00:24:50,113
I left the watches in my room
for her to take.

331
00:24:50,197 --> 00:24:51,406
On purpose?

332
00:24:51,489 --> 00:24:52,741
You let her steal from you?

333
00:24:53,992 --> 00:24:56,203
What on earth were you trying to do?

334
00:24:56,286 --> 00:24:59,789
Being short of money
makes people do bad things.

335
00:24:59,873 --> 00:25:01,166
I wanted to prevent that.

336
00:25:01,249 --> 00:25:03,627
You let her steal
to stop her from doing bad things?

337
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:05,295
As if that makes any sense.

338
00:25:05,378 --> 00:25:06,421
Hwang Geum-ju.

339
00:25:06,504 --> 00:25:08,715
You're so materialistic,
just like your name suggests.

340
00:25:08,798 --> 00:25:10,383
What? Look here, Bong-go.

341
00:25:10,467 --> 00:25:12,052
Then does that make you a bongo drum?

342
00:25:12,135 --> 00:25:14,638
Look at you two, acting like children.

343
00:25:14,721 --> 00:25:15,722
That's enough!

344
00:25:15,805 --> 00:25:17,849
I'm sick and tired of you
always using money

345
00:25:17,933 --> 00:25:21,311
to try to control everyone
and get everything your way.

346
00:25:21,394 --> 00:25:23,271
As if that's my concern.

347
00:25:23,355 --> 00:25:24,606
It's why we're no longer together.

348
00:25:24,689 --> 00:25:26,441
Money can't buy you everything!

349
00:25:26,524 --> 00:25:28,026
Why do you two always bicker?

350
00:25:28,109 --> 00:25:29,653
Do you still have feelings for each other?

351
00:25:29,736 --> 00:25:30,612
-As if!
-As if!

352
00:25:31,404 --> 00:25:32,864
You watch your tone.

353
00:25:33,531 --> 00:25:35,659
Sit, you two.

354
00:25:40,163 --> 00:25:42,082
I saw the look in her eyes

355
00:25:43,083 --> 00:25:44,125
when she called me Mom.

356
00:25:46,086 --> 00:25:49,214
In that moment,
she truly thought of me as her mom.

357
00:25:50,257 --> 00:25:51,633
Her eyes weren't lying.

358
00:25:53,218 --> 00:25:55,470
I won't abandon her.

359
00:25:56,972 --> 00:25:59,724
She was my daughter,
even if for a brief moment.

360
00:26:00,850 --> 00:26:01,810
I will forgive her

361
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:04,187
and help her turn over a new leaf.

362
00:26:05,063 --> 00:26:08,275
I want to put my faith in my mom.

363
00:26:10,652 --> 00:26:12,070
That reminds me. Gan I-sik.

364
00:26:12,153 --> 00:26:14,072
When will we know about the masks?

365
00:26:22,122 --> 00:26:23,957
Our Hee-sik outdid himself.

366
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:25,583
He really struck out.

367
00:26:25,667 --> 00:26:29,296
So much for graduating from the
National Police University with honors.

368
00:26:29,963 --> 00:26:32,465
We made a fool of ourselves
by committing to this case

369
00:26:32,549 --> 00:26:35,385
based on a text he received
from an anonymous sender.

370
00:26:37,262 --> 00:26:38,096
You know what?

371
00:26:38,888 --> 00:26:40,432
Tell him to abort the operation.

372
00:26:43,977 --> 00:26:46,479
We located everyone
who received drugs from Baldy.

373
00:26:46,563 --> 00:26:48,273
Hee-sik found the supply wallet,

374
00:26:48,356 --> 00:26:50,233
and everything checked out
when I traced it.

375
00:26:50,317 --> 00:26:51,568
Okay.

376
00:26:57,324 --> 00:26:59,492
Hey, Young-tak. Did the NFS
get back to us about the masks?

377
00:26:59,576 --> 00:27:01,745
They couldn't find any trace of drugs.

378
00:27:01,828 --> 00:27:03,747
The team leader says you should come back.

379
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:05,457
Nothing was detected in the masks?

380
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:06,791
That's right.

381
00:27:06,875 --> 00:27:09,836
We're feeling the heat from everywhere,
so just come back quietly.

382
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:13,673
They're going to call us suckers
for following a single text

383
00:27:13,757 --> 00:27:14,966
all thanks to you.

384
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:16,718
The masks weren't the source?

385
00:27:18,803 --> 00:27:20,889
Young-tak, I looked into Ryu Si-o.

386
00:27:20,972 --> 00:27:23,892
There's no record of him in the country
between the ages of 20 to 32.

387
00:27:24,642 --> 00:27:25,894
We need to look into his finances

388
00:27:25,977 --> 00:27:28,521
and find out where he got
the money for his business.

389
00:27:28,605 --> 00:27:30,774
That's a job for the National Tax Service.

390
00:27:30,857 --> 00:27:32,609
I'm staying undercover.

391
00:27:32,692 --> 00:27:33,902
Something's not right.

392
00:27:35,987 --> 00:27:37,113
So it wasn't the masks?

393
00:27:37,197 --> 00:27:38,490
It wasn't.

394
00:27:41,451 --> 00:27:43,745
CEO HWANG GEUM-JU

395
00:27:44,996 --> 00:27:48,333
He's the only Korean fund manager
who'd get brunch on weekends

396
00:27:48,416 --> 00:27:50,794
with Warren Buffett on Wall Street.

397
00:27:50,877 --> 00:27:52,629
He launders money

398
00:27:52,712 --> 00:27:54,714
and easily doubles it for the one percent.

399
00:27:54,798 --> 00:27:58,343
Shell corporations
also fall under his purview.

400
00:27:58,426 --> 00:28:00,678
I'm letting you in on this
because it's you.

401
00:28:01,471 --> 00:28:05,058
You have more than enough cash
ready to be spent,

402
00:28:05,642 --> 00:28:08,436
but that isn't the case
for other wealthy people like us.

403
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:09,979
Our assets are our stocks.

404
00:28:10,063 --> 00:28:12,315
And as you know,
stocks are too transparent.

405
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:14,317
I should look into Bread Song,

406
00:28:15,276 --> 00:28:18,488
or Macaroni Song, or whatever his name is.

407
00:28:19,656 --> 00:28:21,241
There's something fishy about him.

408
00:28:24,285 --> 00:28:25,370
HANGOVER SOUP

409
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:54,899
-This is Kang--
-You get back here!

410
00:28:55,483 --> 00:28:57,861
Are my orders just a joke to you?

411
00:29:00,363 --> 00:29:01,406
I'll head back, sir.

412
00:29:07,287 --> 00:29:09,456
-I have to head back.
-Okay.

413
00:29:11,708 --> 00:29:13,334
Hey, you.

414
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:15,420
Don't just stack them out here.

415
00:29:15,503 --> 00:29:16,671
Carry them to the kitchen.

416
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:20,133
I'm afraid our policy
is to deliver everything to your doorstep.

417
00:29:20,216 --> 00:29:22,510
Taking them in
is your responsibility, sir.

418
00:29:22,594 --> 00:29:25,430
You sure have a mouth for a delivery guy.

419
00:29:25,513 --> 00:29:27,891
Don't talk back
and just do as you're told.

420
00:29:28,683 --> 00:29:31,394
If I call Doogo and file a complaint
about your services,

421
00:29:31,478 --> 00:29:33,646
you'll get the boot.

422
00:29:34,522 --> 00:29:37,025
The customer is king.

423
00:29:37,817 --> 00:29:40,069
Don't you know how things work?

424
00:29:40,153 --> 00:29:41,196
We hear you, sir.

425
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:42,447
We'll move them for you.

426
00:29:49,913 --> 00:29:53,833
Unbelievable. A girl doing delivery work?

427
00:29:57,295 --> 00:30:01,591
Then maybe you can lend a hand, sir.

428
00:30:01,674 --> 00:30:03,843
Why should I help when it's your job?

429
00:30:04,344 --> 00:30:06,971
No wonder idiots
can't get better jobs than this.

430
00:30:21,569 --> 00:30:23,988
There we go. Let's hurry out.

431
00:30:24,489 --> 00:30:27,242
Go on without me.
This is the last of it anyway.

432
00:30:27,325 --> 00:30:29,452
I'll stay behind and wrap things up.

433
00:30:31,538 --> 00:30:34,165
I'm begging you.
Please don't cause any trouble.

434
00:30:34,249 --> 00:30:35,625
Don't worry.

435
00:30:35,708 --> 00:30:38,169
Now shoo.

436
00:30:38,253 --> 00:30:39,295
Shoo.

437
00:30:39,379 --> 00:30:41,714
I'll get going. I'll call you later.

438
00:30:42,298 --> 00:30:43,424
Sure. See you later.

439
00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:46,344
You kids must be kidding me.

440
00:30:46,427 --> 00:30:50,765
Those need to go in the pantry, damn it.

441
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:53,351
Maybe it's time
you put in the work, you jerk.

442
00:30:53,434 --> 00:30:54,477
"You jerk"?

443
00:30:55,353 --> 00:30:56,688
Have you lost your mind?

444
00:30:58,314 --> 00:30:59,482
Why you little…

445
00:31:00,149 --> 00:31:01,234
-Hey, you.
-Sir.

446
00:31:01,734 --> 00:31:04,153
She's from Mongolia
and hasn't learned honorifics.

447
00:31:05,697 --> 00:31:06,781
Unbelievable.

448
00:31:06,865 --> 00:31:10,285
I didn't like that look of yours
from the start.

449
00:31:10,368 --> 00:31:13,037
Why do you stare at people like that?

450
00:31:13,121 --> 00:31:14,163
Move these already.

451
00:31:14,247 --> 00:31:15,456
That little brat.

452
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:17,417
For goodness' sake.

453
00:31:18,167 --> 00:31:19,002
Let's go.

454
00:31:34,767 --> 00:31:36,060
Yes, I'm on my way.

455
00:31:44,986 --> 00:31:46,905
Go without me. I have unfinished business.

456
00:31:49,032 --> 00:31:50,408
Hey, wait!

457
00:31:52,952 --> 00:31:55,747
What did that guy do to deserve this?

458
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:57,165
All this for being a jerk?

459
00:32:02,295 --> 00:32:03,254
What now?

460
00:32:03,338 --> 00:32:04,881
I'm here to eat.

461
00:32:11,512 --> 00:32:13,222
Will others be joining you?

462
00:32:13,306 --> 00:32:14,474
No, it's just me.

463
00:32:14,557 --> 00:32:16,476
What's wrong? Is there a problem?

464
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:19,228
This table is for larger groups.
Sit elsewhere.

465
00:32:19,312 --> 00:32:22,690
Bring me a bowl of backbone hangover soup.

466
00:32:22,774 --> 00:32:24,734
-What?
-I'm hungry.

467
00:32:24,817 --> 00:32:25,693
Bring it here.

468
00:32:25,777 --> 00:32:26,903
You crazy brat.

469
00:32:26,986 --> 00:32:29,447
Is it crazy to sit at a table for eight?

470
00:32:29,530 --> 00:32:30,865
Is it crazy to be hungry?

471
00:32:30,949 --> 00:32:32,450
I'm not serving you. Get out.

472
00:32:32,533 --> 00:32:33,660
You can't do that.

473
00:32:33,743 --> 00:32:35,370
Who are you to refuse service?

474
00:32:35,453 --> 00:32:36,996
You said it yourself

475
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:38,623
that the customer is king.

476
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:42,585
Don't just stand there

477
00:32:42,669 --> 00:32:45,046
and bring me my backbone hangover soup.

478
00:32:45,129 --> 00:32:46,172
Fine.

479
00:32:46,923 --> 00:32:48,508
Just sit elsewhere while I ask nicely.

480
00:32:48,591 --> 00:32:49,842
No, I like it here.

481
00:32:49,926 --> 00:32:51,344
You don't want to?

482
00:32:51,427 --> 00:32:53,179
Then leave. Get out!

483
00:32:54,514 --> 00:32:56,724
Don't annoy me when I'm hungry!

484
00:32:59,686 --> 00:33:01,145
You have flimsy tables.

485
00:33:04,273 --> 00:33:05,400
Are you happy now?

486
00:33:05,942 --> 00:33:07,694
It's a table for one.

487
00:33:08,695 --> 00:33:09,821
Bring me my soup.

488
00:33:14,158 --> 00:33:15,159
Debone it.

489
00:33:17,912 --> 00:33:19,664
Do it, will you?

490
00:33:20,456 --> 00:33:23,960
Remember how I moved all your boxes
to your kitchen pantry?

491
00:33:24,711 --> 00:33:27,422
Maybe I should call
the franchise headquarters

492
00:33:27,505 --> 00:33:30,091
and post our interaction on social media.

493
00:33:31,384 --> 00:33:34,554
Are you only nice
to paying patrons at your restaurant

494
00:33:34,637 --> 00:33:36,389
and mean to everyone else?

495
00:33:39,475 --> 00:33:40,351
It's for the soup.

496
00:33:40,435 --> 00:33:43,604
The rest is for the glue you'll need
to reattach this table.

497
00:33:50,987 --> 00:33:52,572
Don't go on power trips,

498
00:33:52,655 --> 00:33:55,033
you dummy!

499
00:34:02,123 --> 00:34:03,666
No, you have the wrong number.

500
00:34:08,129 --> 00:34:09,839
What brought you here, ma'am?

501
00:34:10,882 --> 00:34:11,716
My car.

502
00:34:14,552 --> 00:34:15,928
Bread Song,

503
00:34:16,554 --> 00:34:18,431
or in Korean, "Singing Baked Goods."

504
00:34:19,348 --> 00:34:21,350
Anyway, I'm here to see him.

505
00:34:21,434 --> 00:34:24,479
You'll need an appointment
if you wish to see Mr. Song.

506
00:34:33,112 --> 00:34:35,198
Here. Take this to Mr. Bread.

507
00:34:36,449 --> 00:34:40,036
This passbook's balance will be enough
to get me through his door.

508
00:34:47,126 --> 00:34:48,086
Just a second, ma'am.

509
00:34:48,169 --> 00:34:49,796
I'll be right back.

510
00:35:01,849 --> 00:35:04,310
My life can change.

511
00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:18,533
Thirty-two,

512
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:20,034
twenty-six,

513
00:35:20,118 --> 00:35:21,119
eighteen.

514
00:35:23,955 --> 00:35:25,498
Thirty-two, twenty-six,

515
00:35:25,581 --> 00:35:26,833
eighteen.

516
00:35:30,419 --> 00:35:32,547
Thirty-two,

517
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:34,340
twenty-six,

518
00:35:35,424 --> 00:35:36,384
eight…

519
00:35:38,261 --> 00:35:39,929
I'm ruling out sexual harassment.

520
00:35:40,638 --> 00:35:42,056
What do the numbers mean?

521
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:43,891
The humidity, fine dust level,

522
00:35:43,975 --> 00:35:46,018
and temperature for the day.

523
00:35:46,602 --> 00:35:48,187
To mellow the hearts of clients

524
00:35:48,271 --> 00:35:50,148
who need a break from KOSDAQ, NASDAQ,

525
00:35:50,231 --> 00:35:52,817
interest rates, exchange rates,
bank balances, and others,

526
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:54,777
I greet them with a subtle joke.

527
00:35:58,072 --> 00:35:59,073
What a freak.

528
00:36:01,367 --> 00:36:02,618
He will see you.

529
00:36:12,753 --> 00:36:14,213
Ninety-six, forty-two,

530
00:36:14,297 --> 00:36:15,339
seventy.

531
00:36:16,799 --> 00:36:19,093
Ninety-six, forty-two,

532
00:36:19,969 --> 00:36:21,012
seventy.

533
00:36:22,889 --> 00:36:23,890
What could they mean?

534
00:36:49,582 --> 00:36:50,708
May I have a seat?

535
00:36:52,126 --> 00:36:53,461
You may lie down if you want.

536
00:37:03,679 --> 00:37:06,766
I'm here to get some advice
on asset management.

537
00:37:12,772 --> 00:37:14,065
Yes?

538
00:37:14,565 --> 00:37:15,399
Hodor?

539
00:37:16,859 --> 00:37:18,110
Patch me through.

540
00:37:22,323 --> 00:37:25,201
Hodor, don't worry.

541
00:37:25,284 --> 00:37:29,872
I'll just transfer
100 billion rubles for now.

542
00:37:29,956 --> 00:37:35,336
The Russian government is keeping
a close watch due to tax issues.

543
00:37:39,298 --> 00:37:40,341
Patience is key.

544
00:37:40,925 --> 00:37:41,926
Trust me!

545
00:37:47,682 --> 00:37:48,641
I apologize for that.

546
00:37:49,558 --> 00:37:51,060
Judging by your bank balance,

547
00:37:51,143 --> 00:37:53,271
I doubt you're interested
in increasing your assets.

548
00:37:53,354 --> 00:37:55,564
I'll cut right to the chase.

549
00:37:56,774 --> 00:38:00,403
As you can tell,
I have excess cash at hand.

550
00:38:01,237 --> 00:38:03,823
I hear you're a master
at handling black money.

551
00:38:07,368 --> 00:38:08,202
Black money?

552
00:38:15,751 --> 00:38:17,211
You must have an offshore account.

553
00:38:19,463 --> 00:38:23,592
I have about 50 million dollars
in a bank in Amsterdam.

554
00:38:25,261 --> 00:38:27,513
You should invest that cash in real estate

555
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:29,765
rather than keeping it in the bank.

556
00:38:30,558 --> 00:38:32,560
I'll draw up a list

557
00:38:33,185 --> 00:38:36,439
of underrated buildings
in Amsterdam or Almere.

558
00:38:36,522 --> 00:38:39,859
It's time you turned to real estate
for your asset management…

559
00:38:42,194 --> 00:38:43,362
before you get tracked.

560
00:38:50,286 --> 00:38:52,747
Having too much cash
will lead to a tax investigation.

561
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:56,542
The head of the Chicago Mafia
wasn't caught by the police or the FBI.

562
00:38:56,625 --> 00:38:58,419
It was the IRS that took him down.

563
00:38:58,502 --> 00:39:00,212
Korea is heading down that road.

564
00:39:01,297 --> 00:39:05,593
But isn't real estate also traceable?

565
00:39:05,676 --> 00:39:08,721
No, real estate is safe to invest in.

566
00:39:08,804 --> 00:39:12,600
The investigative power
lies solely with the Dutch government.

567
00:39:13,309 --> 00:39:15,895
The Korean government won't find out
unless the Dutch cooperate.

568
00:39:18,397 --> 00:39:22,443
And the Dutch government
would do no such thing.

569
00:39:22,526 --> 00:39:24,153
I see.

570
00:39:24,695 --> 00:39:25,780
Is that so?

571
00:39:26,572 --> 00:39:29,075
Any business that transpires between us

572
00:39:30,451 --> 00:39:31,702
will be kept…

573
00:39:33,913 --> 00:39:34,747
a secret.

574
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:38,626
You can trust me.

575
00:39:44,423 --> 00:39:45,466
So…

576
00:39:45,549 --> 00:39:49,595
you're a Wall Street hotshot
and an Ivy League graduate,

577
00:39:50,304 --> 00:39:51,847
yet you speak in a dialect.

578
00:40:07,238 --> 00:40:11,492
"I will never forget my roots."

579
00:40:12,076 --> 00:40:13,119
That's what it means.

580
00:40:13,202 --> 00:40:15,079
Have my assistant
book your next appointment.

581
00:40:15,162 --> 00:40:15,996
That's it…

582
00:40:17,373 --> 00:40:18,207
for today.

583
00:40:20,251 --> 00:40:21,127
Sure.

584
00:40:22,169 --> 00:40:23,212
Then…

585
00:40:27,049 --> 00:40:28,509
Do you like bread?

586
00:40:29,176 --> 00:40:31,887
Your name is Bread, so I thought I'd ask.

587
00:40:33,305 --> 00:40:34,473
I'm obsessed with it.

588
00:40:45,609 --> 00:40:48,737
Book my next appointment
and give me a call.

589
00:40:51,824 --> 00:40:52,658
Yes, ma'am.

590
00:40:53,784 --> 00:40:54,910
Ninety-six,

591
00:40:55,494 --> 00:40:57,079
forty-two, and seventy.

592
00:40:57,163 --> 00:40:58,247
What do they mean?

593
00:41:01,625 --> 00:41:02,626
My IQ,

594
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:04,086
my son's waist measurement,

595
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:06,839
and the age of my dad
who ran out on us ten years ago.

596
00:41:17,725 --> 00:41:19,518
It's a dossier on Ri Hwa-ja.

597
00:41:20,352 --> 00:41:21,520
Thank you.

598
00:41:21,604 --> 00:41:23,063
She's an orphan.

599
00:41:23,772 --> 00:41:26,108
There's a young group
that stemmed from some gangsters,

600
00:41:26,192 --> 00:41:28,444
and its leader is infamous
for training orphans

601
00:41:28,527 --> 00:41:30,488
and initiating those who are useful.

602
00:41:31,071 --> 00:41:32,781
She's their only female member.

603
00:41:32,865 --> 00:41:34,783
She showed promise from a young age.

604
00:41:39,121 --> 00:41:41,248
When kids are initiated
into the gang at 20,

605
00:41:41,332 --> 00:41:42,500
their feet get branded.

606
00:41:43,209 --> 00:41:44,835
That way, it won't be obvious.

607
00:41:45,753 --> 00:41:48,464
Apparently, it was so that
they could be identified if they died.

608
00:41:49,131 --> 00:41:50,382
It's a tradition of sorts.

609
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:55,846
-Hee-sik, let's roll.
-Okay.

610
00:41:55,930 --> 00:41:57,139
Thanks for this.

611
00:41:57,223 --> 00:41:58,432
Should I send officers to Doogo?

612
00:41:58,516 --> 00:42:00,392
Not right now. I'll take it from here.

613
00:42:00,476 --> 00:42:01,310
Got it.

614
00:42:14,406 --> 00:42:15,407
Grandma,

615
00:42:16,033 --> 00:42:18,494
bone soup and donuts go well together.

616
00:42:19,078 --> 00:42:20,204
They pair well,

617
00:42:20,287 --> 00:42:22,289
and I'm one to value a good food pairing.

618
00:42:22,373 --> 00:42:23,666
How could they pair well?

619
00:42:25,459 --> 00:42:27,294
It'd make you vomit.

620
00:42:27,378 --> 00:42:29,421
No, they're good together.
It melts in your mouth.

621
00:42:31,131 --> 00:42:32,591
Right. Whatever you say.

622
00:42:34,718 --> 00:42:35,970
I apologize, Nam-in.

623
00:42:36,053 --> 00:42:37,304
It's all my fault.

624
00:42:37,388 --> 00:42:38,806
-Mother.
-Yes?

625
00:42:38,889 --> 00:42:42,518
Were you perhaps invited
to a British royal wedding?

626
00:42:44,019 --> 00:42:44,979
You see,

627
00:42:46,063 --> 00:42:48,148
I'm dreaming of a future

628
00:42:48,232 --> 00:42:51,277
with that handsome barista over there,
who I'm entangled with,

629
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:54,238
which is why I need your full cooperation.

630
00:42:54,321 --> 00:42:57,366
Just live a quiet life as a humanitarian.

631
00:42:57,449 --> 00:42:59,451
Why bother with romance?

632
00:42:59,535 --> 00:43:01,912
You're still technically married
to your husband

633
00:43:01,996 --> 00:43:03,539
and don't know if he's alive or not.

634
00:43:03,622 --> 00:43:06,041
That's what's been bothering me too.

635
00:43:06,125 --> 00:43:08,460
Right? You're worried about Grandpa too.

636
00:43:09,795 --> 00:43:12,172
Do I need to put him
on the Interpol wanted list?

637
00:43:13,591 --> 00:43:15,217
The tarot cards say

638
00:43:15,301 --> 00:43:17,261
-he's in the east.
-He's alive?

639
00:43:17,344 --> 00:43:19,263
Of course, obviously.

640
00:43:19,346 --> 00:43:22,141
What the hell is that man up to?

641
00:43:23,976 --> 00:43:25,144
-Ms. Gil.
-Goodness.

642
00:43:25,227 --> 00:43:27,229
Yes, Jun-hee?

643
00:43:27,313 --> 00:43:29,648
Now that we found Nam-soon,

644
00:43:29,732 --> 00:43:32,526
-finding Father--
-When we do, I'll kill him.

645
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:36,363
I'm going to bag Mr. Seo.

646
00:43:36,447 --> 00:43:38,657
It's my life's final goal.

647
00:43:38,741 --> 00:43:39,700
Mother!

648
00:43:40,242 --> 00:43:42,119
How could you say in front of Nam-in?

649
00:43:42,202 --> 00:43:43,621
This is unbelievable.

650
00:43:43,704 --> 00:43:45,164
How could you?

651
00:43:45,247 --> 00:43:48,334
Come to think of it,
you and Mom treat me like I'm invisible.

652
00:43:48,417 --> 00:43:50,628
How could you say that
in front of your grandson?

653
00:43:50,711 --> 00:43:51,670
"Bag him"?

654
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:56,175
You two have no romance
or a sense of humor.

655
00:43:56,258 --> 00:43:58,469
Anyway, I will crush anyone

656
00:43:58,552 --> 00:44:01,889
who gets in the way of achieving my goal.

657
00:44:01,972 --> 00:44:04,391
Consider yourselves warned.

658
00:44:04,475 --> 00:44:05,684
Got it?

659
00:44:07,394 --> 00:44:08,646
Jun-hee.

660
00:44:15,861 --> 00:44:17,780
How can you eat after hearing that?

661
00:44:17,863 --> 00:44:19,198
Didn't it ruin your appetite?

662
00:44:19,281 --> 00:44:21,408
As if my appetite would be fazed by that.

663
00:44:37,257 --> 00:44:39,718
Jun-hee, you sure do make
a mean cup of joe…

664
00:44:41,136 --> 00:44:42,221
I mean,

665
00:44:42,930 --> 00:44:45,015
you brew some excellent coffee.

666
00:44:46,016 --> 00:44:47,267
Never did I realize

667
00:44:47,351 --> 00:44:51,271
that coffee could be this good.

668
00:44:53,982 --> 00:44:57,903
You sure know how to make someone's day.

669
00:44:57,986 --> 00:45:01,407
I feel so heartened at your compliments.

670
00:45:02,825 --> 00:45:05,911
I've never been one
to throw about empty words.

671
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:11,125
Jun-hee.

672
00:45:13,919 --> 00:45:15,003
Life…

673
00:45:15,754 --> 00:45:18,465
is short, isn't it?

674
00:45:18,549 --> 00:45:19,967
That's not true, Ms. Gil.

675
00:45:20,843 --> 00:45:24,471
I've been studying up
on genomes these days.

676
00:45:24,555 --> 00:45:25,764
Gnomes?

677
00:45:25,848 --> 00:45:29,643
What's there to study
about gnomes of all things?

678
00:45:29,726 --> 00:45:30,727
Goodness.

679
00:45:32,271 --> 00:45:33,564
I see you're humorous too.

680
00:45:34,606 --> 00:45:37,693
Anyway, what I learned
from the Human Genome Project

681
00:45:38,318 --> 00:45:41,488
is that living until 100 is now a reality.

682
00:45:41,572 --> 00:45:43,866
Life is quite long now.

683
00:45:44,408 --> 00:45:45,325
I see.

684
00:45:45,993 --> 00:45:47,453
You must be thrilled by that.

685
00:45:53,542 --> 00:45:56,003
It's my daughter. I should take it.

686
00:45:56,086 --> 00:45:57,045
Sure.

687
00:45:58,755 --> 00:45:59,756
Hello?

688
00:46:00,424 --> 00:46:01,633
Hey, Yun-jin.

689
00:46:01,717 --> 00:46:04,470
Dad, I'm in trouble.

690
00:46:04,553 --> 00:46:05,721
What's going on?

691
00:46:05,804 --> 00:46:07,556
I hit someone with my car.

692
00:46:07,639 --> 00:46:08,515
What?

693
00:46:09,641 --> 00:46:10,684
Where are you now?

694
00:46:10,767 --> 00:46:12,352
At Gangnam Police Station.

695
00:46:13,187 --> 00:46:15,355
Hold on. Switch to a video call.

696
00:46:15,439 --> 00:46:17,065
See if that's really her.

697
00:46:17,149 --> 00:46:19,443
This could be a voice phishing scam.

698
00:46:20,277 --> 00:46:23,947
Yun-jin, let's talk face-to-face.

699
00:46:25,616 --> 00:46:27,743
Did you really get into an accident?

700
00:46:27,826 --> 00:46:30,329
Dad, what do I do?

701
00:46:30,412 --> 00:46:32,915
I have to pay
a settlement of 20 million won

702
00:46:32,998 --> 00:46:34,791
to be released under investigation.

703
00:46:34,875 --> 00:46:36,502
If not, I'll be detained.

704
00:46:36,585 --> 00:46:38,295
What do I do?

705
00:46:38,378 --> 00:46:40,756
I'll wire the money straight away.
Don't worry.

706
00:46:41,256 --> 00:46:43,717
-Text me the account number.
-Got it.

707
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:44,635
Hurry.

708
00:46:44,718 --> 00:46:46,136
Excuse me, Ms. Gil.

709
00:46:46,887 --> 00:46:48,472
I must wire this money to her.

710
00:46:48,555 --> 00:46:49,556
Right.

711
00:46:57,856 --> 00:46:59,942
Hold on. Gangnam Police Station, was it?

712
00:47:00,025 --> 00:47:02,361
I know a detective there. Let's go there.

713
00:47:04,988 --> 00:47:06,490
Come on.

714
00:47:17,459 --> 00:47:20,003
-Ms. Gil.
-Ms. Gil, what brings you here?

715
00:47:20,087 --> 00:47:21,964
I'm here about a car accident.

716
00:47:22,047 --> 00:47:23,215
Should I head to the traffic unit?

717
00:47:23,298 --> 00:47:25,300
Allow me to escort you.

718
00:47:25,384 --> 00:47:26,927
-This way, ma'am.
-Let's go.

719
00:47:28,679 --> 00:47:30,389
TRAFFIC ACCIDENT INVESTIGATION TEAM 2

720
00:47:33,892 --> 00:47:35,602
I don't see anyone
by the name of Seo Yun-jin.

721
00:47:36,270 --> 00:47:37,229
What?

722
00:47:39,648 --> 00:47:41,108
The person you called is not available.

723
00:47:41,191 --> 00:47:44,820
-Leave a message after the tone…
-But I had a video call with her.

724
00:47:44,903 --> 00:47:46,321
It was my daughter.

725
00:47:46,405 --> 00:47:48,282
It must have been a deepfake.

726
00:47:48,365 --> 00:47:50,158
-"Deepfake"?
-That's right.

727
00:47:50,242 --> 00:47:51,994
Even one's likeness can be faked.

728
00:47:54,162 --> 00:47:55,289
Did you wire the money?

729
00:47:55,372 --> 00:47:57,874
She needed to settle,
so I wired the money.

730
00:47:57,958 --> 00:48:00,460
It looks like you'll have to report it.

731
00:48:00,544 --> 00:48:03,380
Did someone scam me
by faking my daughter's face?

732
00:48:03,463 --> 00:48:06,133
-Yes.
-Then quickly take his report!

733
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:09,136
You must take it upstairs
to the Cyber Bureau…

734
00:48:09,219 --> 00:48:10,387
Allow me to escort you.

735
00:48:10,470 --> 00:48:12,723
Can't we just do it here
and not move around?

736
00:48:12,806 --> 00:48:15,392
There are all kinds of cases in the world.

737
00:48:15,475 --> 00:48:16,893
It's the same with meat.

738
00:48:16,977 --> 00:48:18,937
-Different cuts--
-What are you saying?

739
00:48:19,021 --> 00:48:20,439
My gosh. Jun-hee?

740
00:48:20,522 --> 00:48:21,648
Goodness.

741
00:48:21,732 --> 00:48:23,817
-Is he your husband?
-A soon-to-be boyfriend.

742
00:48:24,359 --> 00:48:25,193
I see.

743
00:48:30,824 --> 00:48:31,908
Jun-hee.

744
00:48:31,992 --> 00:48:33,243
We haven't been able to contact

745
00:48:33,327 --> 00:48:36,079
the man you struck after flipping his car.

746
00:48:36,163 --> 00:48:37,497
Wait. Is he dead?

747
00:48:37,581 --> 00:48:39,458
I doubt it. There hasn't been a report.

748
00:48:39,541 --> 00:48:41,001
We just can't reach him.

749
00:48:41,084 --> 00:48:43,045
Jun-hee seems furious.

750
00:48:43,128 --> 00:48:45,297
That's how it is
when our kids are involved. Jun-hee?

751
00:49:08,654 --> 00:49:11,948
He was a good instructor
and popular among his students.

752
00:49:12,032 --> 00:49:13,033
But at some point,

753
00:49:13,116 --> 00:49:15,410
he seemed lethargic
and started to skip classes.

754
00:49:16,870 --> 00:49:18,914
Was there anything out of the ordinary?

755
00:49:18,997 --> 00:49:20,582
One thing definitely stood out.

756
00:49:21,333 --> 00:49:22,292
He drank a lot of water.

757
00:49:23,669 --> 00:49:25,545
He even drank the pool water as well.

758
00:49:25,629 --> 00:49:27,214
He drank the pool water?

759
00:49:27,297 --> 00:49:28,882
Yes, on numerous occasions.

760
00:49:28,965 --> 00:49:30,676
He came back after teaching today

761
00:49:30,759 --> 00:49:32,636
and started chugging the pool water.

762
00:49:35,764 --> 00:49:37,099
Yes, sir.

763
00:49:37,933 --> 00:49:39,893
Yes. What?

764
00:50:04,710 --> 00:50:06,044
Stop. What's with you?

765
00:50:17,097 --> 00:50:18,140
Hey.

766
00:50:18,932 --> 00:50:21,518
Look at this place. What a mess.

767
00:50:21,601 --> 00:50:22,436
Tell me about it.

768
00:50:22,519 --> 00:50:24,521
What the hell?

769
00:51:14,446 --> 00:51:17,324
Mr. Seo, there's no need to cry.

770
00:51:17,407 --> 00:51:19,993
Is it because you lost 20 million won?

771
00:51:21,286 --> 00:51:23,038
My daughter's sick.

772
00:51:23,622 --> 00:51:26,374
She's taking time off work
to recover from major surgery.

773
00:51:27,626 --> 00:51:28,543
Goodness.

774
00:51:29,294 --> 00:51:30,462
That's terrible.

775
00:51:30,545 --> 00:51:33,840
I can't stomach the fact
that those thugs know her face.

776
00:51:33,924 --> 00:51:35,842
I'm finding it hard to deal with things

777
00:51:35,926 --> 00:51:38,887
ever since my wife passed away.

778
00:51:44,643 --> 00:51:47,771
Mr. Seo, those guys are busy.

779
00:51:48,772 --> 00:51:51,650
They won't have time
to come after you or your daughter.

780
00:51:52,275 --> 00:51:53,944
They have a quota to meet

781
00:51:54,027 --> 00:51:56,655
and will be busy
fishing for the next target.

782
00:51:57,405 --> 00:51:59,491
They won't remember her face.

783
00:51:59,574 --> 00:52:01,159
They won't come after her,

784
00:52:01,243 --> 00:52:02,577
so don't you worry.

785
00:52:03,161 --> 00:52:04,329
Do you really think so?

786
00:52:04,412 --> 00:52:06,122
Of course.

787
00:52:08,458 --> 00:52:11,002
If not, I'll take them out.

788
00:52:12,295 --> 00:52:15,841
I'll crush their bones
or fillet their flesh.

789
00:52:18,969 --> 00:52:20,387
Don't be scared.

790
00:52:20,470 --> 00:52:22,514
These are butchering knives.

791
00:52:22,597 --> 00:52:24,641
That's just how determined I am.

792
00:52:26,601 --> 00:52:29,229
I guess my jokes don't fly
with the Korean audience.

793
00:52:30,188 --> 00:52:32,524
It's not like I need knives anyway.

794
00:52:32,607 --> 00:52:34,901
I can break them to pieces
with my bare hands.

795
00:52:35,902 --> 00:52:37,654
It's a thing.

796
00:52:39,573 --> 00:52:42,284
We'll be gradually
getting to know each other,

797
00:52:42,367 --> 00:52:43,994
so I'll leave it here for today.

798
00:52:44,828 --> 00:52:48,373
But seeing tears well up in your eyes

799
00:52:48,456 --> 00:52:51,167
almost broke my heart.

800
00:52:52,294 --> 00:52:53,378
What do you say

801
00:52:54,212 --> 00:52:55,881
to a tasty meal?

802
00:52:56,965 --> 00:52:58,592
How about dried radish greens soup?

803
00:53:00,677 --> 00:53:03,763
We should have whatever you want.

804
00:53:05,098 --> 00:53:06,433
But…

805
00:53:06,516 --> 00:53:09,019
I should probably give Mr. Gang a call.

806
00:53:15,108 --> 00:53:17,777
Yes, Mr. Seo. Of course.

807
00:53:17,861 --> 00:53:19,613
Don't worry. It's fine.

808
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:21,698
I'll see you tomorrow.

809
00:53:21,781 --> 00:53:23,074
One more thing.

810
00:53:24,159 --> 00:53:27,412
Please don't quit working here
even if my grandma annoys you.

811
00:53:28,038 --> 00:53:29,164
I really hope you don't.

812
00:53:51,645 --> 00:53:53,229
Do you want to lose weight?

813
00:53:54,105 --> 00:53:55,815
That's what I took to slim down.

814
00:53:56,524 --> 00:53:58,276
You're like a diamond in the rough.

815
00:53:58,944 --> 00:54:01,738
You'd look amazing if you lost weight.

816
00:54:06,785 --> 00:54:08,161
What was that all about?

817
00:54:21,132 --> 00:54:23,051
I'll look into it alone today.

818
00:54:23,593 --> 00:54:25,345
You continue working on the case.

819
00:54:25,428 --> 00:54:26,429
Okay.

820
00:55:02,549 --> 00:55:03,591
Are you okay?

821
00:55:23,945 --> 00:55:25,155
Are you sick?

822
00:55:27,949 --> 00:55:29,117
Do you need some help?

823
00:55:49,095 --> 00:55:52,474
I'll keep an eye on this slimy jerk.

824
00:55:54,559 --> 00:55:58,313
The main problem is this little punk.

825
00:56:04,444 --> 00:56:06,237
Ms. Jung, come in.

826
00:56:14,704 --> 00:56:16,289
Type in English for me.

827
00:56:17,582 --> 00:56:19,375
The translation software
has been acting up lately.

828
00:56:19,459 --> 00:56:20,335
Yes, ma'am.

829
00:56:23,713 --> 00:56:27,675
Can I truly trust your intel
that there are drugs at Doogo?

830
00:56:30,637 --> 00:56:34,724
"I was informed that a Russian mafia group
was involved with Doogo."

831
00:56:34,808 --> 00:56:36,726
"That Russian mafia group is in Korea."

832
00:56:38,812 --> 00:56:42,690
I also need information
on Ryu Si-o, the CEO.

833
00:56:43,733 --> 00:56:46,861
"He founded Doogo
with money of unknown origin."

834
00:56:46,945 --> 00:56:49,280
"We are currently tracking it."

835
00:56:49,364 --> 00:56:51,783
"Money of unknown origin"?

836
00:56:52,450 --> 00:56:54,994
It's obviously drug money.

837
00:56:56,871 --> 00:56:57,914
Doogo.

838
00:57:00,458 --> 00:57:02,585
Ms. Nam-soon is home.

839
00:57:05,213 --> 00:57:06,256
I'll excuse myself.

840
00:57:06,339 --> 00:57:08,091
Tell Nam-soon to meet me in the study.

841
00:57:08,174 --> 00:57:09,259
Yes, ma'am.

842
00:57:22,021 --> 00:57:22,856
Mr. Hwang?

843
00:57:26,734 --> 00:57:27,610
What is it?

844
00:57:27,694 --> 00:57:29,279
Are you on a dating app?

845
00:57:31,739 --> 00:57:32,740
So am I.

846
00:57:33,992 --> 00:57:35,285
Don't act like you know me on there.

847
00:57:35,368 --> 00:57:36,369
Sure.

848
00:57:38,455 --> 00:57:40,540
I see you're also lonely, Ms. Jung.

849
00:57:41,166 --> 00:57:42,167
Of course.

850
00:57:43,042 --> 00:57:44,210
I'm lonely.

851
00:57:45,420 --> 00:57:48,590
But we humans are born as lonely beings.

852
00:57:48,673 --> 00:57:50,049
Humans are born…

853
00:57:51,509 --> 00:57:53,887
-You're home.
-Hi, Ms. Jung.

854
00:57:54,804 --> 00:57:57,098
-Hi, Uncle.
-Hi, Niece.

855
00:57:57,182 --> 00:57:59,434
Head to the study.
Ms. Hwang is waiting for you.

856
00:58:00,518 --> 00:58:01,561
All right.

857
00:58:04,898 --> 00:58:05,857
Mom.

858
00:58:07,901 --> 00:58:10,820
Nam-soon.

859
00:58:15,074 --> 00:58:17,076
You agreed to tell me
what you've been up to

860
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:18,953
with your cop friend, right?

861
00:58:19,037 --> 00:58:21,664
Right, I was about to get to that.

862
00:58:21,748 --> 00:58:22,916
Go ahead.

863
00:58:22,999 --> 00:58:24,000
Mom.

864
00:58:24,792 --> 00:58:25,793
I…

865
00:58:27,128 --> 00:58:29,088
have been working
as a delivery person at Doogo.

866
00:58:31,090 --> 00:58:31,925
Doogo?

867
00:58:32,592 --> 00:58:35,053
I hear there are drugs at that place.

868
00:58:36,763 --> 00:58:39,724
Gan I-sik has been tasked
to locate the drugs,

869
00:58:39,807 --> 00:58:41,267
and I've been helping him.

870
00:58:42,936 --> 00:58:45,355
Now my own child is involved in this mess.

871
00:58:46,356 --> 00:58:47,565
The thing is,

872
00:58:49,359 --> 00:58:51,778
he thought the drugs
were disguised as masks,

873
00:58:51,861 --> 00:58:52,862
but they weren't.

874
00:58:53,988 --> 00:58:57,450
So Gan I-sik won't be at Doogo
starting tomorrow.

875
00:58:57,534 --> 00:59:00,203
His bosses told him to abort the mission

876
00:59:01,287 --> 00:59:02,747
since the information was false.

877
00:59:05,083 --> 00:59:06,376
I don't know what I can…

878
00:59:15,260 --> 00:59:17,011
Is he Ryu Si-o?

879
00:59:21,933 --> 00:59:22,892
Have you seen him?

880
00:59:22,976 --> 00:59:24,852
Yes, at the warehouse.

881
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:26,646
Nam-soon,

882
00:59:27,188 --> 00:59:29,440
this might be your fate.

883
00:59:30,191 --> 00:59:33,486
You leaving me to grow up
in the vast plains of Mongolia

884
00:59:34,112 --> 00:59:36,197
to become as bold as Genghis Khan himself

885
00:59:36,739 --> 00:59:38,408
and coming back to me.

886
00:59:38,491 --> 00:59:39,993
All of this must be fate.

887
00:59:42,078 --> 00:59:44,581
You can't lead a normal life.

888
00:59:45,623 --> 00:59:46,708
Right.

889
00:59:49,586 --> 00:59:51,170
Let's save the world.

890
00:59:52,463 --> 00:59:53,548
You and me.

891
00:59:54,465 --> 00:59:57,510
Okay. I can do that.

892
00:59:58,094 --> 00:59:59,304
I know I can.

893
01:00:05,476 --> 01:00:08,104
GANGHAN POLICE PRECINCT

894
01:00:08,187 --> 01:00:09,939
Young-tak, have you tried this number?

895
01:00:12,066 --> 01:00:13,860
The Dericoin is as far as we can get.

896
01:00:13,943 --> 01:00:15,236
Now that Baldy's dead,

897
01:00:15,320 --> 01:00:16,779
we can't question him about the supplier.

898
01:00:16,863 --> 01:00:18,781
The ID of the visitor
who gave him the mask

899
01:00:18,865 --> 01:00:21,034
-turned out to be fake.
-Right.

900
01:00:23,244 --> 01:00:25,747
To think a fake ID breached
a governmental facility's security…

901
01:00:25,830 --> 01:00:28,791
At least you managed to track
where the drugs trickle down.

902
01:00:30,585 --> 01:00:32,420
Its fatality rate is menacing.

903
01:00:33,671 --> 01:00:37,175
There has never been a drug
this potent before.

904
01:00:43,306 --> 01:00:45,975
What I can't grasp is the drug's cycle.

905
01:00:46,684 --> 01:00:47,894
I don't get it either.

906
01:00:48,436 --> 01:00:50,688
Some take two days while some take three.

907
01:00:51,314 --> 01:00:54,817
All they have in common
is their excessive consumption of water.

908
01:01:03,743 --> 01:01:04,702
It's water!

909
01:01:04,786 --> 01:01:05,703
It reacts to water.

910
01:01:05,787 --> 01:01:07,789
It turns into a drug
once it reacts to water.

911
01:01:08,665 --> 01:01:10,625
Consuming water increases its potency.

912
01:01:10,708 --> 01:01:11,876
It would then kill you, sir.

913
01:01:13,086 --> 01:01:14,545
You must not drink water.

914
01:01:24,180 --> 01:01:25,181
CEO RYU SI-O

915
01:01:25,264 --> 01:01:26,974
I checked with the manager in charge.

916
01:01:27,058 --> 01:01:29,769
All warehouse employees
had already gone home that day.

917
01:01:31,020 --> 01:01:33,356
-And the security cameras?
-The lights were out,

918
01:01:33,439 --> 01:01:35,149
so it'll be hard to see anything.

919
01:01:36,317 --> 01:01:38,695
Also, this video was uploaded
on the company forum

920
01:01:38,778 --> 01:01:40,446
by Manager Heo of the logistics team.

921
01:01:40,530 --> 01:01:42,156
There's an extraordinarily strong girl.

922
01:01:42,949 --> 01:01:44,534
She's from Mongolia.

923
01:01:49,997 --> 01:01:52,917
Film me again
and I'll report you for slacking off.

924
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:54,085
Shoo.

925
01:01:58,965 --> 01:02:00,258
Are you sick?

926
01:02:01,134 --> 01:02:01,968
Do you need some help?

927
01:02:08,725 --> 01:02:09,892
There you are.

928
01:02:15,732 --> 01:02:16,607
Hello.

929
01:02:17,900 --> 01:02:19,444
-Okay.
-Good.

930
01:02:19,527 --> 01:02:21,863
Inspector Kang,
you have a visitor downstairs.

931
01:02:23,072 --> 01:02:24,198
Thanks.

932
01:02:42,550 --> 01:02:45,094
The one who tipped you off
about drugs at Doogo

933
01:02:46,304 --> 01:02:47,138
was me.

934
01:02:49,265 --> 01:02:51,100
You dig further into Doogo.

935
01:02:52,018 --> 01:02:53,060
Meanwhile,

936
01:02:53,603 --> 01:02:55,313
I'll look into Ryu Si-o.

937
01:03:52,286 --> 01:03:54,705
STRONG GIRL NAM-SOON

938
01:03:54,789 --> 01:03:57,208
I got caught stealing.

939
01:03:57,291 --> 01:03:59,252
I ask you to observe her every move

940
01:03:59,335 --> 01:04:00,253
and report back to me.

941
01:04:00,336 --> 01:04:02,380
Please put your faith in Nam-soon.

942
01:04:02,463 --> 01:04:03,339
I don't think I can.

943
01:04:03,422 --> 01:04:04,715
She thinks she's invincible
and acts rashly.

944
01:04:04,799 --> 01:04:07,635
It seems your mother is dating someone.

945
01:04:07,718 --> 01:04:09,387
Is dating a priority at that age?

946
01:04:09,470 --> 01:04:10,763
Our hearts beat even in old age.

947
01:04:10,847 --> 01:04:12,974
I want to move out.
I'd rather live with Dad.

948
01:04:13,057 --> 01:04:14,433
Taking it without an antidote

949
01:04:14,517 --> 01:04:16,143
is practically self-destruction.

950
01:04:16,227 --> 01:04:18,938
Still, you briefly get
a taste of what you desire.

951
01:04:19,021 --> 01:04:20,940
Then isn't death a worthy price to pay?

952
01:04:21,023 --> 01:04:23,568
Sir, please snap out of it.

953
01:04:25,778 --> 01:04:30,783
