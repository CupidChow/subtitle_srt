LEGEND OF MAJANG-DONG, GIL JOONG-GAN

GEUMJU GROUP'S CEO, HWANG GEUM-JU

GIRL FROM MONGOLIA, GANG NAM-SOON

EPISODE 3
THREE GENERATIONS

6
00:00:52,051 --> 00:00:54,471
BONG PHOTO GALLERY

7
00:00:54,554 --> 00:00:55,638
Hang on.

8
00:01:17,952 --> 00:01:20,747
You said you were here
for a passport photo, right?

9
00:01:21,831 --> 00:01:22,665
Yeah.

10
00:01:24,125 --> 00:01:25,502
I'll take it for you.

11
00:01:26,753 --> 00:01:28,213
Come on in.

12
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:33,134
Hello
It's nice to meet you

13
00:01:33,218 --> 00:01:34,135
We meet again…

14
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:36,513
-Hey, Gan I-sik.
-Nam-soon.

15
00:01:36,596 --> 00:01:39,015
We caught the Airdnd scammer
and found your passport.

16
00:01:39,098 --> 00:01:40,725
Really? I'm glad to hear that.

17
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:45,104
Then I wouldn't need a passport photo.

18
00:01:45,188 --> 00:01:46,397
Got it.

19
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:50,985
You won't need to take a photo?

20
00:01:53,696 --> 00:01:55,907
Right, I see.

21
00:02:01,329 --> 00:02:03,164
Thank you, sir.

22
00:02:04,499 --> 00:02:06,126
Thank you very much.

23
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:08,753
I'm using honorifics
for the first time in Korea.

24
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:11,965
I didn't expect it to roll off my tongue.

25
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:25,311
Wait up, young lady!

26
00:02:44,205 --> 00:02:45,915
She already spent all your money.

27
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:49,002
Will you press charges
against the woman who scammed you?

28
00:02:49,085 --> 00:02:50,837
Only a civil suit
will get you your money back.

29
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:53,506
-"Press charges"?
-Of course you should press charges.

30
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:55,008
I'll press charges.

31
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:58,511
I'm pressing charges.

32
00:03:00,138 --> 00:03:01,973
My tailbone is shattered.

33
00:03:02,724 --> 00:03:07,645
The second my butt hit the ground
after she pushed me,

34
00:03:08,229 --> 00:03:09,814
I lost consciousness.

35
00:03:09,898 --> 00:03:14,235
When I came to,
I was hit by an unbearable pain

36
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:17,780
and the realization that my butt
will never be the same.

37
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:20,158
-I can't cycle anymore…
-He needs eight weeks of recovery.

38
00:03:20,241 --> 00:03:22,577
Medical bills,
compensation for emotional distress,

39
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:24,829
and lost wages from being unable to work.

40
00:03:24,913 --> 00:03:26,664
You'll be sued on all accounts.

41
00:03:26,748 --> 00:03:30,084
I don't want to sound sexist or anything,

42
00:03:30,168 --> 00:03:34,130
but don't you think it's absurd
that a woman flung a man 50 m away?

43
00:03:34,213 --> 00:03:36,007
Then how do you explain
his medical report?

44
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:37,300
You think the doctor lied?

45
00:03:37,383 --> 00:03:39,385
He must've hurt himself elsewhere.

46
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:41,137
Aren't you a cop?

47
00:03:41,804 --> 00:03:43,765
Is this what cops are supposed to do?

48
00:03:43,848 --> 00:03:45,808
This is exactly what cops do.

49
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:48,561
One of our duties
is to prevent bad citizens

50
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:51,189
from abusing the law
by slandering the innocent.

51
00:03:51,272 --> 00:03:52,941
She's right. I did that to him.

52
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:55,985
I pushed him.

53
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:56,986
I'm sure he got injured.

54
00:03:58,363 --> 00:03:59,572
Press charges.

55
00:03:59,656 --> 00:04:01,741
I should learn how things work
in Korea anyway.

56
00:04:02,408 --> 00:04:03,868
I'll do the same to the scammer.

57
00:04:03,952 --> 00:04:05,620
You can press charges against me,

58
00:04:05,703 --> 00:04:07,622
and I'll press charges against her.

59
00:04:08,957 --> 00:04:10,792
Do you really want to be that busy?

60
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:12,377
What can I do about it?

61
00:04:13,503 --> 00:04:14,420
Just so you know,

62
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:17,507
I only did it because your husband
pushed my friend first.

63
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:19,759
You need to know that.

64
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:22,720
Your husband started it.

65
00:04:22,804 --> 00:04:25,390
I couldn't let him hurt my friend.

66
00:04:25,473 --> 00:04:27,809
What's with the casual language,
you little brat?

67
00:04:27,892 --> 00:04:31,813
Tell your husband that I'm sorry.

68
00:04:32,397 --> 00:04:33,356
But you know what?

69
00:04:34,649 --> 00:04:36,150
I only used one finger.

70
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:39,320
If I had used two, he could've died.

71
00:04:39,404 --> 00:04:40,446
What?

72
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:43,741
I'm quite strong.

73
00:04:44,534 --> 00:04:47,412
I'll work a part-time job
to cover his medical bills.

74
00:04:47,495 --> 00:04:50,456
And I'll press charges
against your husband too.

75
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:51,958
He shoved my friend, after all.

76
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:53,793
I'm off then.

77
00:04:54,919 --> 00:04:56,004
You can't just leave like that.

78
00:04:57,213 --> 00:04:59,382
Should I sing a tune on my way out
or something?

79
00:05:03,511 --> 00:05:06,180
GANGHAN POLICE PRECINCT

80
00:05:06,264 --> 00:05:09,475
How could you have busted his tailbone
when you're only skin and bones?

81
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:11,352
That's nonsensical.

82
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,565
Hello

83
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:17,400
-It's nice to meet you
-What's with this ringtone?

84
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:19,027
-We meet again…
-Did you set this?

85
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:20,862
It's to help you learn formal speech.

86
00:05:20,945 --> 00:05:25,116
Talking down to people like that
will lead to at least three disputes a day

87
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:27,243
-and make your life hell.
-You know,

88
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:28,911
you are very handsome.

89
00:05:31,247 --> 00:05:32,081
You

90
00:05:32,665 --> 00:05:34,834
are very good-looking.

91
00:05:38,921 --> 00:05:39,881
Happy now?

92
00:05:43,968 --> 00:05:45,511
I see you know how to be polite.

93
00:05:47,138 --> 00:05:48,181
Very good.

94
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:57,607
Is she the Hulk or what?

95
00:05:58,858 --> 00:06:00,735
-No way!
-She's from Mongolia, right?

96
00:06:00,818 --> 00:06:01,944
What on earth did she eat?

97
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:03,738
After the Han River tent fiasco,

98
00:06:03,821 --> 00:06:05,364
the homeless couple stated

99
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:07,909
that she was as strong
as a movie superhero.

100
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:11,954
If you ask me,
she's the reincarnation of Genghis Khan.

101
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:14,165
Ms. Gang Nam-soon
isn't your average person.

102
00:06:14,248 --> 00:06:17,043
She's super strong. Unbelievably so.

103
00:06:17,126 --> 00:06:19,921
I saw you drinking Pangtao beer.

104
00:06:20,004 --> 00:06:21,464
You were dancing too.

105
00:06:21,547 --> 00:06:23,174
In neon undies of all things.

106
00:06:23,758 --> 00:06:27,053
They say that Mongolians
have the best eyesight, don't they?

107
00:06:27,136 --> 00:06:28,679
Yes, of course.

108
00:06:30,973 --> 00:06:32,308
That was it.

109
00:06:35,394 --> 00:06:37,355
She saw my underwear for sure.

110
00:06:38,022 --> 00:06:39,190
I can't believe it.

111
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:21,566
Hello, Ms. Hwang.

112
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:26,529
Right.

113
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:28,406
Hello to you too.

114
00:07:28,906 --> 00:07:31,451
This is Mr. Ryu Si-o, CEO of Doogo.

115
00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:33,369
I'm sure you've heard of Doogo,

116
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:35,455
the e-commerce logistics company

117
00:07:35,538 --> 00:07:38,207
-soon to be listed on the KOSDAQ.
-I see.

118
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:41,419
It's the company that sells
everything except land, isn't it?

119
00:07:41,502 --> 00:07:44,255
And this is Ms. Hwang Geum-ju.

120
00:07:44,338 --> 00:07:47,550
No member of this club
has more cash than she does.

121
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:49,760
Then,

122
00:07:49,844 --> 00:07:51,387
I'll leave you two alone to talk.

123
00:07:59,353 --> 00:08:00,730
I guess we're the only ones.

124
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:03,107
What do you mean?

125
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:06,277
The only two members of Heritage
who aren't of old money.

126
00:08:07,236 --> 00:08:09,989
So you're new money too?

127
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:15,036
I just don't click well
with trust fund babies.

128
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:18,789
They're a bunch of lucky kids
who were born rich.

129
00:08:20,249 --> 00:08:21,667
What would they know?

130
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:27,340
Forging your own path is how you learn.

131
00:08:28,549 --> 00:08:29,592
Not everyone

132
00:08:30,593 --> 00:08:32,094
can earn a lot of money quickly.

133
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:36,265
That's one heck of a mentality.

134
00:08:37,058 --> 00:08:38,100
Anyway,

135
00:08:38,976 --> 00:08:41,229
us new money should see each other around.

136
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:10,716
Look at it.

137
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,969
-What's that?
-Look at that.

138
00:09:13,761 --> 00:09:15,054
Please have your fill.

139
00:09:15,137 --> 00:09:16,556
Thank you, Ms. Jung.

140
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:17,640
My pleasure.

141
00:09:18,933 --> 00:09:19,850
Let us pray.

142
00:09:19,934 --> 00:09:21,352
-Right.
-Of course.

143
00:09:24,438 --> 00:09:25,606
I'm stuffed.

144
00:09:27,525 --> 00:09:28,651
That was incredible.

145
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:30,570
That was great.

146
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:35,700
How about we go to the garden
for some tea?

147
00:09:38,494 --> 00:09:39,412
What's this?

148
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:51,215
I was too busy eyeing the place
to eat properly.

149
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:52,592
How can one be this rich?

150
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:54,885
I've seen my fair share
of Gangnam billionaires,

151
00:09:54,969 --> 00:09:56,429
but none who are this rich.

152
00:09:56,512 --> 00:09:58,681
So what can we do to help?

153
00:09:58,764 --> 00:10:01,142
We'll need that secretary gone
before we raid the bedroom.

154
00:10:01,225 --> 00:10:02,310
Actually,

155
00:10:03,311 --> 00:10:05,104
I've changed my mind.

156
00:10:05,187 --> 00:10:06,731
-What?
-I'm sure you can relate

157
00:10:06,814 --> 00:10:08,107
now that you've seen the place.

158
00:10:08,858 --> 00:10:10,109
I'm staying…

159
00:10:11,902 --> 00:10:13,112
as her daughter.

160
00:10:15,823 --> 00:10:18,534
You're being greedy, Hwa-ja.

161
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:20,036
Fakes don't last long.

162
00:10:20,786 --> 00:10:23,581
See this fake Rolax I got
in Shenzhen, for instance.

163
00:10:23,664 --> 00:10:25,791
The plating wore off and gave me a rash.

164
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:28,502
My skin practically reeks of iron now.

165
00:10:28,586 --> 00:10:31,422
That's why they call me "Iron Man"
where I work.

166
00:10:33,257 --> 00:10:35,134
I'll last if I get rid of the real thing.

167
00:10:40,848 --> 00:10:41,891
It's a Mongolian ger.

168
00:10:44,518 --> 00:10:45,770
She's as strong as an ox.

169
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:47,730
She has a hammer for an arm.

170
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:49,315
That girl is from Mongolia

171
00:10:49,398 --> 00:10:50,733
and is looking for her mom.

172
00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:53,569
I have a feeling she's Gang Nam-soon.

173
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:54,654
She's not Korean,

174
00:10:54,737 --> 00:10:57,490
so the police won't bat an eye
even if she dies.

175
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,325
Let's get rid of her.

176
00:10:59,408 --> 00:11:00,785
Are you proposing murder?

177
00:11:01,369 --> 00:11:04,121
My mom makes all my wishes come true.

178
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:06,624
And I'll do

179
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:08,334
the same for you.

180
00:11:09,377 --> 00:11:11,545
The girl's strength is beyond imagination

181
00:11:11,629 --> 00:11:12,838
according to my mom.

182
00:11:12,922 --> 00:11:15,800
You alone wouldn't be a match for her.

183
00:11:15,883 --> 00:11:17,468
So gather everyone…

184
00:11:20,638 --> 00:11:21,680
and destroy her.

185
00:11:27,436 --> 00:11:29,563
I had parked my car down here,

186
00:11:29,647 --> 00:11:31,816
and this is what I woke up to
this morning.

187
00:11:31,899 --> 00:11:33,943
So who do you suggest did this?

188
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:37,446
The crazy old hag who called me!

189
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:38,614
Hey.

190
00:11:38,697 --> 00:11:41,283
By "crazy old hag," do you mean me?

191
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:43,077
Wait. Was it you?

192
00:11:44,328 --> 00:11:46,789
Judging by her voice,
she's definitely that old hag!

193
00:11:46,872 --> 00:11:48,999
If I'm a crazy old hag,

194
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:51,585
you're an even crazier shithead.

195
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:55,548
How is a good-for-nothing scumbag like you
living in this luxury complex?

196
00:11:55,631 --> 00:11:56,966
It makes me want to move out.

197
00:11:57,049 --> 00:11:58,008
What?

198
00:11:58,092 --> 00:11:59,468
Have you lost your goddamn mind?

199
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:00,636
Go away.

200
00:12:05,808 --> 00:12:07,560
This is a parking lot.

201
00:12:08,185 --> 00:12:10,688
It's a space reserved for residents.

202
00:12:10,771 --> 00:12:14,692
It's not proper etiquette
to just be hanging out around here.

203
00:12:14,775 --> 00:12:15,901
Let's head to the station.

204
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:17,778
I'd like to actually try using that place,

205
00:12:17,862 --> 00:12:19,613
given the amount of taxes I pay.

206
00:12:25,703 --> 00:12:27,204
My car.

207
00:12:27,788 --> 00:12:30,291
You really flipped the car
with your bare hands.

208
00:12:35,379 --> 00:12:39,925
"President Gil Joong-gan
of the Majang-dong Butchers' Association"?

209
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:42,178
So you're the legendary
Queen of Majang-dong?

210
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:43,429
Have you heard of me?

211
00:12:43,512 --> 00:12:46,515
Are you kidding me? I know all about CLPR.

212
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:49,685
With a cow on your left shoulder
and a pig on your right,

213
00:12:49,768 --> 00:12:52,646
you became a legend
by taking control of Majang-dong.

214
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:54,899
A legend? You flatter me.

215
00:12:54,982 --> 00:12:56,901
Do you know her, Detective Jang?

216
00:12:56,984 --> 00:12:59,487
She's a legend among those
at Seongdong Police Station.

217
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:01,405
How could I not know her?

218
00:13:06,243 --> 00:13:09,038
The legend began in 1983,

219
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:11,624
back when gangsters controlled
all the small businesses,

220
00:13:11,707 --> 00:13:13,334
and anarchy ruled the streets.

221
00:13:13,417 --> 00:13:15,252
The most violent cartel in the country,

222
00:13:15,336 --> 00:13:17,004
the Seomun gang, raided Majang-dong

223
00:13:17,087 --> 00:13:18,797
to take control of the district.

224
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:30,601
The petite Gil Joong-gan

225
00:13:30,684 --> 00:13:33,312
walked down the middle of the street,
just like her name.

226
00:13:33,395 --> 00:13:34,688
Rumor has it

227
00:13:34,772 --> 00:13:37,608
that she had given birth
only three days before that day.

228
00:13:44,198 --> 00:13:45,491
Majang-dong

229
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:49,703
is a sacred place that leads
the nation's healthy meat-eating culture.

230
00:13:50,788 --> 00:13:53,832
It shouldn't be controlled
or monopolized by a private party.

231
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:56,335
The market should stay

232
00:13:56,418 --> 00:13:59,880
as a place of the consumer,
by the consumer, and for the consumer,

233
00:13:59,964 --> 00:14:01,590
and not be soiled with blood.

234
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:05,469
If you truly are gangsters,

235
00:14:05,553 --> 00:14:07,513
let's settle it with a proper fight!

236
00:14:07,596 --> 00:14:09,306
-With who?
-Me.

237
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:14,353
Let's do it with no weapons.

238
00:14:15,145 --> 00:14:16,438
Let's keep the flesh intact.

239
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:18,482
It's meat that matters most
in Majang-dong.

240
00:14:18,566 --> 00:14:20,359
After all, broken bones can still be sold.

241
00:14:20,442 --> 00:14:21,569
Pretty Boy.

242
00:14:22,486 --> 00:14:24,113
-Yes, boss.
-Bring it on.

243
00:14:29,618 --> 00:14:31,871
-Boss.
-You're the best.

244
00:14:31,954 --> 00:14:32,955
Nicely done!

245
00:14:33,038 --> 00:14:35,207
How dare you slap me?

246
00:15:16,248 --> 00:15:19,293
Just like that,
peace was restored in Majang-dong.

247
00:15:19,376 --> 00:15:22,087
No gangster has stepped foot
in Majang-dong ever since.

248
00:15:22,171 --> 00:15:25,341
Seongdong Police Station's
Violent Crimes Unit even had to downsize.

249
00:15:27,718 --> 00:15:28,552
Hey.

250
00:15:28,636 --> 00:15:30,179
Get an estimate on the car.

251
00:15:31,305 --> 00:15:34,516
If you flip it back over,
only the roof should be scratched.

252
00:15:35,017 --> 00:15:36,977
It's not that bad.

253
00:15:37,061 --> 00:15:39,897
I was careful enough
to minimize the damage.

254
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:43,359
What about the compensation
for my emotional distress?

255
00:15:43,901 --> 00:15:47,071
The car I love and cherish
was flipped upside down.

256
00:15:47,154 --> 00:15:49,365
You think you know some legalese, do you?

257
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:51,116
Hey!

258
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:53,786
Then what about my emotional distress?

259
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:55,913
Look, officers.

260
00:15:56,664 --> 00:16:01,752
I don't cause trouble
if I'm left to my own devices.

261
00:16:01,835 --> 00:16:03,879
I was about to pull my car out

262
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:06,799
when I noticed that this jerk's
was blocking mine.

263
00:16:06,882 --> 00:16:10,052
The parking lot at our complex
has more than enough spaces,

264
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:14,139
so his parking there could only mean
that he was full-on drunk.

265
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:15,432
I wasn't drunk.

266
00:16:15,516 --> 00:16:18,519
What, so you double-parked while sober?

267
00:16:18,602 --> 00:16:19,979
Are you a psychopath or what?

268
00:16:20,062 --> 00:16:21,105
What?

269
00:16:21,188 --> 00:16:24,024
This old hag must have a death wish.

270
00:16:24,108 --> 00:16:25,609
Are you out of your mind?

271
00:16:25,693 --> 00:16:27,778
You'd better watch that tone of yours.

272
00:16:28,445 --> 00:16:29,863
You ugly brat.

273
00:16:30,948 --> 00:16:34,827
Anyway, I called him
to ask that he pull his car out,

274
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:38,831
but he responded
with highly disrespectful insults.

275
00:16:38,914 --> 00:16:39,748
What was it again?

276
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:42,626
"An old hag like you should stay home
and watch her grandkids"?

277
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:44,003
I actually recorded it.

278
00:16:44,086 --> 00:16:45,254
Should I play it for you?

279
00:16:45,337 --> 00:16:46,463
I'll let you hear it.

280
00:16:49,174 --> 00:16:50,467
Come on.

281
00:16:50,551 --> 00:16:53,345
You'll come around in about an hour,

282
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:56,098
so go lean on that wall over there
and not on me.

283
00:16:56,181 --> 00:16:57,975
Someone get him some cold water.

284
00:16:58,058 --> 00:17:01,145
We need him awake for his interrogation.

285
00:17:01,228 --> 00:17:03,480
-Right.
-My gosh.

286
00:17:03,564 --> 00:17:06,442
For a guy his size, he's utterly useless.

287
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:10,195
I'll send you the recording
of his verbal assault,

288
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:12,072
so give me a number I can reach.

289
00:17:12,156 --> 00:17:13,240
Sure thing.

290
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:17,119
-Here you go.
-Good.

291
00:17:17,661 --> 00:17:20,789
I'm starving. It's well past dinnertime.

292
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:21,874
I'm going home.

293
00:17:21,957 --> 00:17:23,625
Of course, ma'am. Take care.

294
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:24,543
We'll be in touch.

295
00:17:24,626 --> 00:17:27,296
Eat meat, Detective.
That's how you can be as strong as me.

296
00:17:27,379 --> 00:17:28,672
I'll keep that in mind.

297
00:17:29,173 --> 00:17:30,424
I'll get going then.

298
00:17:33,969 --> 00:17:34,970
Have a pleasant day.

299
00:17:41,268 --> 00:17:42,144
Hey,

300
00:17:42,227 --> 00:17:45,230
buy yourself some mouthwash
on the way home.

301
00:17:45,314 --> 00:17:47,232
Your breath stinks.

302
00:17:47,316 --> 00:17:49,485
Do you poop through your mouth
or something?

303
00:17:52,696 --> 00:17:54,573
What am I going to do with her?

304
00:18:00,454 --> 00:18:01,330
Bong-soon!

305
00:18:09,546 --> 00:18:11,965
Are you all right? Did you get hurt?

306
00:18:12,049 --> 00:18:13,050
I'm fine.

307
00:18:13,133 --> 00:18:15,469
Yes, of course you weren't hurt.

308
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:17,513
What was it this time?

309
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:20,682
I didn't do anything wrong, as always.

310
00:18:25,312 --> 00:18:28,232
Hello, I'm Ahn Min-hyuk,
Ms. Do Bong-soon's husband.

311
00:18:28,315 --> 00:18:29,483
I see.

312
00:18:29,566 --> 00:18:31,193
Could you explain what happened?

313
00:18:31,276 --> 00:18:34,238
They broke into a shelter
for abandoned dogs

314
00:18:34,321 --> 00:18:35,906
and took off with some of them.

315
00:18:35,989 --> 00:18:38,075
Then they sold them to a dogfighting ring.

316
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:42,496
Now you're going so far
as to save dogs' lives as well?

317
00:18:43,038 --> 00:18:45,999
Aren't things busy enough
with just the human race?

318
00:18:47,584 --> 00:18:49,086
I guess it's just me.

319
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:51,964
What will get her out of here
the quickest?

320
00:18:52,047 --> 00:18:54,258
My wife isn't one
to use violence without reason.

321
00:18:54,341 --> 00:18:56,510
I can vouch for that.

322
00:18:56,593 --> 00:18:59,680
But we should still hear them out.

323
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:03,058
All right, let's hear it.

324
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:06,436
Tell the detective
what bad things you did to those dogs

325
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,021
who can't speak for themselves.

326
00:19:08,105 --> 00:19:09,523
Why aren't you saying anything?

327
00:19:10,023 --> 00:19:11,483
As you can see,

328
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:14,570
she beat them up
specifically around their jaws.

329
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:16,905
So we're having trouble
getting their statements.

330
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:18,657
But I held back.

331
00:19:19,783 --> 00:19:20,701
Be quiet.

332
00:19:21,577 --> 00:19:23,787
They want to press charges,
so what will it be?

333
00:19:23,871 --> 00:19:26,456
They can go ahead.
I'll call my legal team.

334
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:28,041
Let them press charges.

335
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:30,961
Anyway, these men
showed cruelty to animals.

336
00:19:31,044 --> 00:19:33,547
The only thing my wife is guilty of

337
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:36,967
is standing up for abandoned animals
within the lines of the law.

338
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:38,177
Exactly.

339
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:42,598
I never hit anyone who doesn't deserve it.

340
00:19:43,473 --> 00:19:44,433
Quiet!

341
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:48,270
I can't believe you two.
Wasn't the beating enough?

342
00:19:49,897 --> 00:19:53,650
The job looks like it was done
by someone in my family.

343
00:19:57,404 --> 00:19:58,739
I'm Gil Joong-gan from Gangnam.

344
00:19:58,822 --> 00:19:59,823
Goodness.

345
00:19:59,907 --> 00:20:01,283
Hello, ma'am.

346
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:03,118
I'm Do Bong-soon from Dobong.

347
00:20:04,161 --> 00:20:04,995
I apologize.

348
00:20:05,078 --> 00:20:07,247
You troubled yourself
to solve an issue in my area.

349
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:10,584
Things have been hectic
here in Gangnam lately.

350
00:20:10,667 --> 00:20:11,835
We'll do better.

351
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:15,422
It's not like we're gangsters
with designated turf.

352
00:20:15,505 --> 00:20:17,549
We should cover for each other

353
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:18,926
when the need arises.

354
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:20,719
-Min Min, say hello.
-Right.

355
00:20:20,802 --> 00:20:22,095
She's a family relative.

356
00:20:22,179 --> 00:20:24,681
Meet Ms. Gil Joong-gan of Majang-dong.

357
00:20:24,765 --> 00:20:26,475
Hello, I'm Ahn Min-hyuk.

358
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:27,559
Goodness.

359
00:20:28,685 --> 00:20:31,897
You look just as bright
as a bowl licked clean by a dog.

360
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:33,899
I heard you married a catch.

361
00:20:33,982 --> 00:20:36,193
You two make a great couple.

362
00:20:36,276 --> 00:20:37,402
I bet you never quarrel.

363
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:39,238
It's not like I stand a chance.

364
00:20:41,365 --> 00:20:43,408
I hope things work out well here.

365
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:44,826
I'll see you around.

366
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:46,954
Sure. Have a good day, ma'am.

367
00:20:47,037 --> 00:20:48,205
-Take care.
-You're handsome.

368
00:20:48,288 --> 00:20:49,456
Thank you.

369
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,708
-Take care, ma'am.
-Take care, ma'am.

370
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,004
All right.

371
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:59,258
I guess it's time
you collected their statements.

372
00:20:59,341 --> 00:21:00,425
-Right.
-Here.

373
00:21:00,509 --> 00:21:02,010
Now you may not be able to talk,

374
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:04,012
but you still have working fingers.

375
00:21:04,846 --> 00:21:05,847
Get writing.

376
00:21:07,891 --> 00:21:08,934
There.

377
00:21:09,851 --> 00:21:11,103
Your teamwork is admirable.

378
00:21:11,186 --> 00:21:13,355
This isn't our first rodeo.

379
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:15,023
We have to hurry back to our kids.

380
00:21:15,565 --> 00:21:16,441
By "we," I mean me.

381
00:21:18,443 --> 00:21:19,653
What gives?

382
00:21:19,736 --> 00:21:21,697
Get on with your statements, okay?

383
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:23,240
I'm busy as it is.

384
00:21:25,033 --> 00:21:26,368
All that work made me hungry.

385
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:27,703
-You're hungry?
-Yes.

386
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:29,246
-How about fried chicken?
-Yes.

387
00:21:29,329 --> 00:21:30,664
You look so pretty today.

388
00:21:30,747 --> 00:21:32,249
I can't take it.

389
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:35,294
It felt like destiny.

390
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:38,046
I think she was Nam-soon.

391
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:41,091
Nam-soon must constantly be on your mind,

392
00:21:41,174 --> 00:21:44,344
seeing how you thought
a random customer was her.

393
00:21:44,428 --> 00:21:45,387
It's not that.

394
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:47,597
I felt a tingling sensation
when I laid my eyes on her.

395
00:21:50,267 --> 00:21:52,602
I just don't think Hwa-ja is my daughter.

396
00:21:52,686 --> 00:21:54,354
Right. Even Mom agrees.

397
00:21:54,438 --> 00:21:56,982
Really? Have you been
talking to her lately?

398
00:21:57,065 --> 00:21:58,275
Of course not.

399
00:21:58,942 --> 00:22:00,610
I overheard her talking to Ms. Jung.

400
00:22:02,738 --> 00:22:04,865
Anyway, I ordered six sandwiches.

401
00:22:04,948 --> 00:22:07,534
You're eating way too much.
You could die at this rate.

402
00:22:08,702 --> 00:22:10,287
I'd love to stop eating too.

403
00:22:10,787 --> 00:22:11,830
I'm suffering too, Dad.

404
00:22:11,913 --> 00:22:13,832
It's not like I want to keep eating.

405
00:22:13,915 --> 00:22:15,876
There must be
something wrong with my head.

406
00:22:15,959 --> 00:22:18,420
Everything just tastes so good.

407
00:22:18,503 --> 00:22:19,338
It's killing me.

408
00:22:19,421 --> 00:22:22,132
You can't go on like this, Nam-in.
You're addicted to carbs.

409
00:22:22,215 --> 00:22:24,801
Why isn't there rehab for such a thing?

410
00:22:24,885 --> 00:22:26,470
Ask your mom to open one.

411
00:22:26,553 --> 00:22:27,971
As if I'd talk to her.

412
00:22:28,930 --> 00:22:32,434
We've received a new batch of coffee beans
from Tanzania today.

413
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:35,020
-It'll leave a different aftertaste.
-Thank you.

414
00:22:35,103 --> 00:22:36,772
Thanks, Mr. Seo.

415
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:41,068
Dad, let me introduce you
to the café's new barista.

416
00:22:41,151 --> 00:22:42,194
I see.

417
00:22:42,277 --> 00:22:45,280
He's a true talent who won the Grand Prix

418
00:22:45,363 --> 00:22:47,074
at the 2018 World Barista Championship.

419
00:22:48,784 --> 00:22:50,494
I hope you'll help him along the way.

420
00:22:50,577 --> 00:22:52,412
I should ask him the same thing.

421
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:54,664
Enjoy your time then.

422
00:23:00,337 --> 00:23:01,421
-Nam-in.
-Yes?

423
00:23:01,505 --> 00:23:03,924
Give me a tarot reading
on Nam-soon's whereabouts.

424
00:23:04,007 --> 00:23:04,883
All right.

425
00:23:09,846 --> 00:23:13,642
In the midst of everything crumbling down,

426
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:18,063
like destiny,
a savior will come to the rescue…

427
00:23:18,146 --> 00:23:19,397
So will we meet her or not?

428
00:23:19,481 --> 00:23:21,441
Drop the flashy act and just tell me.

429
00:23:22,025 --> 00:23:24,027
She's coming our way.

430
00:23:24,528 --> 00:23:27,364
Mr. Bae Hyeon-sik,
you'll be given a general's outfit.

431
00:23:29,157 --> 00:23:30,325
I'll be back after lunch.

432
00:23:31,118 --> 00:23:34,287
What about me? I want to wear this too.

433
00:23:34,371 --> 00:23:35,288
As if.

434
00:23:35,372 --> 00:23:36,289
That one's yours.

435
00:23:38,834 --> 00:23:41,336
Twist their legs!

436
00:23:41,419 --> 00:23:43,088
-Twist their legs!
-Yes, sir.

437
00:23:50,137 --> 00:23:51,429
Why didn't you check the props?

438
00:23:52,597 --> 00:23:54,683
They're brand new. Why did they snap?

439
00:23:54,766 --> 00:23:57,519
Sorry about that.
I should've relaxed more.

440
00:23:57,602 --> 00:23:58,520
What the hell?

441
00:23:58,603 --> 00:24:00,397
Can't I be a general instead?

442
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,773
General, my foot.

443
00:24:01,857 --> 00:24:04,109
Just play the role that was given to you.

444
00:24:04,192 --> 00:24:06,945
But I'd be really good at playing one.

445
00:24:07,028 --> 00:24:08,822
Really? Then stand up.

446
00:24:08,905 --> 00:24:10,323
You'll get the sticks instead.

447
00:24:10,407 --> 00:24:12,367
Sticks? Like the batons the generals use?

448
00:24:13,034 --> 00:24:14,661
Commence the beating!

449
00:24:24,087 --> 00:24:26,047
GANGHAN POLICE PRECINCT

450
00:24:26,631 --> 00:24:27,966
This is Kang Hee-sik from the DIU.

451
00:24:28,049 --> 00:24:29,384
Could I get background checks

452
00:24:29,467 --> 00:24:31,094
on all Air Mong passengers from that day?

453
00:24:32,095 --> 00:24:33,221
-Okay.
-Let's roll, Hee-sik.

454
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:34,306
Chamma's done.

455
00:24:34,389 --> 00:24:35,348
Got it.

456
00:24:36,016 --> 00:24:38,852
Another forensics team
is currently going through it,

457
00:24:38,935 --> 00:24:41,855
but these guys sure dice up the evidence
before taking off.

458
00:24:42,898 --> 00:24:44,274
They're impossible to catch.

459
00:24:45,275 --> 00:24:47,235
I bet they destroyed the IP address.

460
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:48,904
These phones won't get us anywhere.

461
00:24:48,987 --> 00:24:52,157
Drug dealers are always
one step ahead of the police.

462
00:24:56,369 --> 00:24:57,370
Hello?

463
00:24:58,622 --> 00:24:59,623
What?

464
00:25:00,332 --> 00:25:01,958
One of the passengers is dead?

465
00:25:05,587 --> 00:25:07,047
Sure, send it over.

466
00:25:11,426 --> 00:25:13,178
She only entered the country recently,

467
00:25:13,261 --> 00:25:14,638
but she's already dead.

468
00:25:14,721 --> 00:25:15,931
Do you recognize her?

469
00:25:16,598 --> 00:25:17,474
I do.

470
00:25:20,685 --> 00:25:21,770
Wait for me.

471
00:25:22,646 --> 00:25:24,105
He always takes off on his own.

472
00:25:24,189 --> 00:25:25,023
Wait for me!

473
00:25:25,106 --> 00:25:28,068
It was the same substance
found in the late Park Gwang-ja.

474
00:25:28,151 --> 00:25:28,985
Really?

475
00:25:29,069 --> 00:25:31,154
It isn't cocaine or meth.

476
00:25:31,238 --> 00:25:32,280
It seems like a synthetic drug.

477
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:34,449
-It isn't fentanyl either, right?
-It's not.

478
00:25:35,033 --> 00:25:36,076
It's something new.

479
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:38,161
A detailed analysis will tell us more,

480
00:25:38,245 --> 00:25:39,955
but this drug could be terrifying.

481
00:25:40,038 --> 00:25:43,124
She died when her stomach
only had a trace amount of it?

482
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:46,461
If fentanyl was a dog,
this would be more of a wolf.

483
00:25:47,212 --> 00:25:48,505
Here's a gift for you.

484
00:25:51,508 --> 00:25:52,884
The substance in her system

485
00:25:52,968 --> 00:25:55,178
is identical to this baby formula.

486
00:25:55,971 --> 00:25:57,138
It's the same drug.

487
00:26:09,985 --> 00:26:11,027
Let's see.

488
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:15,407
What's this?

489
00:26:18,785 --> 00:26:20,078
It's hard to believe

490
00:26:21,121 --> 00:26:23,331
anyone lived here
considering the lack of food.

491
00:26:24,082 --> 00:26:26,126
There's only water and beer in the fridge.

492
00:26:28,211 --> 00:26:29,045
You saw her body.

493
00:26:30,171 --> 00:26:32,257
She lost over ten kilograms.

494
00:26:34,426 --> 00:26:35,593
Her body rejected food.

495
00:26:36,594 --> 00:26:40,098
That means the drug
stopped her from eating.

496
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:44,894
The drug was smuggled
in one of her possessions.

497
00:26:46,229 --> 00:26:48,440
It was disguised as something
we could never think of.

498
00:27:31,441 --> 00:27:32,442
There's nothing here.

499
00:27:39,866 --> 00:27:40,867
Let's go. It's a bust.

500
00:27:42,118 --> 00:27:43,119
All right.

501
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:14,109
FOOD TRUCK SERVING LOVE

502
00:28:20,407 --> 00:28:21,491
What in the world?

503
00:28:28,081 --> 00:28:29,499
Why do we get different food?

504
00:28:29,999 --> 00:28:31,751
Can't I get in line and have that too?

505
00:28:32,252 --> 00:28:34,712
Jeez. You're an extra, so act like one.

506
00:28:34,796 --> 00:28:36,965
You can't have the same food
the main cast has.

507
00:28:37,048 --> 00:28:38,883
We work together and work equally hard.

508
00:28:38,967 --> 00:28:40,301
Why do we get different food?

509
00:28:40,385 --> 00:28:42,011
You didn't even work.
Why are you eating this?

510
00:28:42,095 --> 00:28:43,972
-Do you want to get fired?
-No, but maybe you do!

511
00:28:44,055 --> 00:28:45,181
-Me?
-Either way,

512
00:28:45,265 --> 00:28:47,225
I'm eating that.

513
00:28:47,308 --> 00:28:48,768
-You eat this.
-Hey.

514
00:28:48,852 --> 00:28:49,978
-Stop it.
-What's going on?

515
00:28:50,478 --> 00:28:52,605
-Who's making a ruckus?
-Director.

516
00:28:52,689 --> 00:28:54,733
An extra is demanding a meal
from the food truck.

517
00:28:54,816 --> 00:28:56,109
Then just fire her.

518
00:28:56,735 --> 00:28:58,194
Who dragged that cat in here?

519
00:28:58,278 --> 00:28:59,654
Why would you fire me

520
00:28:59,738 --> 00:29:01,489
when I've been working this hard?

521
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:03,074
You go get fired!

522
00:29:03,158 --> 00:29:05,618
All you do is
sit behind the camera and yell.

523
00:29:05,702 --> 00:29:06,995
Move.

524
00:29:07,078 --> 00:29:08,204
Shoo!

525
00:29:21,009 --> 00:29:23,720
Hey, call another food truck.

526
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:25,597
One isn't going to be enough.

527
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:27,098
You can eat later on.

528
00:29:27,182 --> 00:29:28,308
It's not like you deserve it.

529
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:51,915
I love your personality.

530
00:29:52,499 --> 00:29:53,416
What's your name,

531
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:54,751
sweet little lady?

532
00:29:54,834 --> 00:29:56,544
I don't like you.

533
00:29:56,628 --> 00:29:57,796
Shoo!

534
00:30:03,968 --> 00:30:07,847
ARABESQUE CROWN TOP LUXURY PARK MANSION

535
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:09,974
I'm coming in.

536
00:30:14,187 --> 00:30:15,063
She's not here.

537
00:30:18,233 --> 00:30:21,277
I'm worried both when she's at the ger
and when she isn't.

538
00:30:22,612 --> 00:30:24,781
Hold on a second.
Why would I worry about her?

539
00:30:25,365 --> 00:30:27,951
No, being worried is the right thing to do

540
00:30:28,034 --> 00:30:30,870
because I'm a good police officer.

541
00:30:33,957 --> 00:30:35,416
GAN I-SIK

542
00:30:42,131 --> 00:30:44,342
How fun is that?

543
00:30:44,425 --> 00:30:46,553
The person you called is not available…

544
00:30:46,636 --> 00:30:48,263
Where is she and what is she up to?

545
00:30:51,099 --> 00:30:53,059
-Hello?
-Hee-sik, it's me.

546
00:30:53,142 --> 00:30:54,102
Hey.

547
00:30:54,185 --> 00:30:56,479
I looked into the missing children
like you asked.

548
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:59,816
From 2006 to 2023,

549
00:30:59,899 --> 00:31:03,278
a total of 23 missing persons reports
were filed in Mongolia.

550
00:31:03,361 --> 00:31:05,738
-Right.
-Most were over 20.

551
00:31:06,447 --> 00:31:08,533
Only four cases
were about missing children.

552
00:31:08,616 --> 00:31:09,450
Really?

553
00:31:09,534 --> 00:31:11,619
I'll send the information to your phone.

554
00:31:11,703 --> 00:31:13,079
HAN HYE-WON, AGE 7
WENT MISSING IN 2006

555
00:31:13,162 --> 00:31:14,706
PARK SU-HWAN, AGE 10
WENT MISSING IN 2008

556
00:31:15,415 --> 00:31:17,417
GANG NAM-SOON, AGE 5
WENT MISSING IN 2006

557
00:31:18,001 --> 00:31:19,252
Gang Nam-soon?

558
00:31:19,335 --> 00:31:21,087
FATHER: GANG BONG-GO

559
00:31:21,170 --> 00:31:22,297
MOTHER: HWANG GEUM-JU

560
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:24,716
FOUND DAUGHTER ON SEP 30, 2023

561
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:39,647
A PHILANTHROPIC ORGANIZATION
FOUNDED BY DONNA SMITH IN 1883

562
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:49,032
First,

563
00:31:49,908 --> 00:31:51,534
I'll start small.

564
00:31:53,244 --> 00:31:54,704
THE WAR ON DRUGS

565
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:08,176
Are you keeping an eye on Hwa-ja?

566
00:32:08,259 --> 00:32:11,262
She seemed to be cooking something up
during yesterday's meal.

567
00:32:11,846 --> 00:32:12,931
Where is she right now?

568
00:32:13,014 --> 00:32:14,974
I had her tailed, ma'am.

569
00:32:15,058 --> 00:32:17,852
I'll inform you of her whereabouts
every time I get word.

570
00:32:17,936 --> 00:32:19,145
Be kind to her.

571
00:32:20,188 --> 00:32:21,356
She's a poor soul.

572
00:32:21,981 --> 00:32:24,442
We have no right to treat others poorly.

573
00:32:25,944 --> 00:32:27,695
If I mistreat someone,

574
00:32:29,113 --> 00:32:31,908
someone else will mistreat my Nam-soon.

575
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:35,286
That's the way of the world.

576
00:32:49,342 --> 00:32:50,301
Are you okay?

577
00:32:50,927 --> 00:32:53,429
-Who are you?
-You pressed charges against me.

578
00:32:53,513 --> 00:32:55,515
-Remember the ger at Han River Park?
-Right.

579
00:32:56,599 --> 00:32:58,142
She's the one who sent me flying.

580
00:32:58,768 --> 00:33:01,604
Gosh, my hips.

581
00:33:02,271 --> 00:33:04,107
Here. Take this for now.

582
00:33:04,732 --> 00:33:07,068
-What's this?
-I'll get you more once I have some.

583
00:33:07,151 --> 00:33:08,361
That's all I have for now.

584
00:33:08,444 --> 00:33:11,572
By the way,
how did you know which room I was in?

585
00:33:11,656 --> 00:33:13,032
Your wife told me.

586
00:33:14,283 --> 00:33:16,494
She even pressed charges on your behalf.

587
00:33:16,577 --> 00:33:18,913
Your wife's nice,
though she has a foul mouth.

588
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:21,165
Anyway, I'll see you around.

589
00:33:21,249 --> 00:33:23,001
-Wait…
-Hey.

590
00:33:23,084 --> 00:33:24,752
I'll also be pressing charges.

591
00:33:25,545 --> 00:33:27,088
You pushed my friend, remember?

592
00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:29,340
But…

593
00:33:29,424 --> 00:33:32,593
You bastard!
I bet you met her in your cycling club.

594
00:33:32,677 --> 00:33:34,345
Who is this woman?

595
00:33:34,429 --> 00:33:35,972
I didn't have an affair!

596
00:33:36,806 --> 00:33:38,641
I'll kill you, you bastard!

597
00:33:38,725 --> 00:33:40,768
-I'll end you!
-What's their problem?

598
00:33:41,269 --> 00:33:43,021
-Answer me this instant!
-Hello

599
00:33:43,104 --> 00:33:46,941
It's nice to meet you
We meet again…

600
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:48,067
PRETTY VAGRANT 1

601
00:33:48,651 --> 00:33:49,569
Hello?

602
00:33:49,652 --> 00:33:51,821
Where are you guys? Have you eaten?

603
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:57,160
Move.

604
00:34:15,136 --> 00:34:16,679
-She's not here.
-She's not here.

605
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:40,828
Got it.

606
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:44,791
Why is she at a tent by Han River?

607
00:34:45,666 --> 00:34:46,751
So?

608
00:34:47,335 --> 00:34:49,087
They gave you a bigger role?

609
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:50,171
Yeah.

610
00:34:51,089 --> 00:34:52,965
You know how to get by in life, Nam-soon.

611
00:34:53,549 --> 00:34:54,717
It's fascinating.

612
00:34:54,801 --> 00:34:56,427
You're stronger than Wonder Woman.

613
00:34:56,511 --> 00:34:57,512
How are you so strong?

614
00:34:58,054 --> 00:34:59,305
I don't know either.

615
00:34:59,972 --> 00:35:02,558
Anyway, I put in a good word for you guys,

616
00:35:02,642 --> 00:35:04,060
so be there for the next shoot.

617
00:35:04,143 --> 00:35:06,145
They promised you jobs as well.

618
00:35:06,813 --> 00:35:08,648
Thanks. My gosh.

619
00:35:08,731 --> 00:35:11,109
Now that I have a home, I feel driven.

620
00:35:11,192 --> 00:35:12,902
I'm going to start earning money now.

621
00:35:12,985 --> 00:35:14,737
Thanks, Nam-soon.

622
00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:38,761
This is the number to Gold Blue,

623
00:35:39,387 --> 00:35:41,013
and this is Ms. Hwang's private number.

624
00:35:41,597 --> 00:35:43,182
-Thanks.
-What was that?

625
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:45,101
They're knocking down the gers.

626
00:35:45,184 --> 00:35:48,062
A report just came in
about thugs bashing them down.

627
00:35:48,146 --> 00:35:49,981
Get out there. Hurry.

628
00:36:11,085 --> 00:36:12,962
What do you think you're doing?

629
00:36:16,048 --> 00:36:17,508
You ruined my house.

630
00:36:17,592 --> 00:36:19,343
Put it back together.

631
00:36:19,427 --> 00:36:21,470
Put both houses back together!

632
00:36:23,014 --> 00:36:24,724
If you don't,

633
00:36:24,807 --> 00:36:27,935
you'll pay for this.

634
00:36:28,644 --> 00:36:29,812
My gosh.

635
00:36:30,438 --> 00:36:31,939
I'm shaking with fear.

636
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:34,817
Let me have it then.

637
00:37:49,725 --> 00:37:51,894
Someone stop that brat!

638
00:37:58,025 --> 00:38:00,278
Bite her!

639
00:38:32,893 --> 00:38:34,603
METRO TRUMP SQUARE SUPER-DUPER TOWER

640
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:36,731
What do we do?

641
00:38:39,358 --> 00:38:41,777
We finally had a roof over our heads.

642
00:38:41,861 --> 00:38:43,237
What do we do now?

643
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:44,280
Gang Nam-soon!

644
00:38:48,617 --> 00:38:50,036
So it was true.

645
00:38:53,789 --> 00:38:54,915
Are you okay?

646
00:38:56,292 --> 00:38:59,295
I won't have to pay
for their medical bills, right?

647
00:38:59,795 --> 00:39:01,339
They're the ones who started it.

648
00:39:03,174 --> 00:39:04,967
Where on earth will I sleep tonight?

649
00:39:09,555 --> 00:39:11,640
Don't cry. I'll build it for you again.

650
00:39:12,308 --> 00:39:13,142
Don't worry.

651
00:39:13,976 --> 00:39:15,019
It was greedy of us

652
00:39:15,102 --> 00:39:17,605
to have dreamed of having a home
in the first place.

653
00:39:18,439 --> 00:39:19,398
Let's go.

654
00:39:23,986 --> 00:39:26,197
I appreciate everything
you did for us, Nam-soon.

655
00:39:27,239 --> 00:39:28,574
I won't forget it.

656
00:39:28,657 --> 00:39:29,825
Where will you go?

657
00:39:29,909 --> 00:39:31,660
As you know,

658
00:39:31,744 --> 00:39:33,829
the whole country is our oyster.

659
00:39:35,331 --> 00:39:36,290
Don't worry.

660
00:39:37,625 --> 00:39:38,501
By the way,

661
00:39:38,584 --> 00:39:40,878
can you make sure that Nam-soon

662
00:39:42,046 --> 00:39:42,963
has a place to stay?

663
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:55,351
I'll get going.

664
00:39:56,644 --> 00:39:58,312
Where do you think you're going?

665
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:00,689
I'd rather stay with them.

666
00:40:00,773 --> 00:40:02,233
Take the hint, will you?

667
00:40:02,775 --> 00:40:04,568
Why keep being the third wheel?

668
00:40:04,652 --> 00:40:06,070
They want to be left alone.

669
00:40:06,821 --> 00:40:07,863
Come with me.

670
00:40:10,449 --> 00:40:11,450
Where are we going?

671
00:40:12,034 --> 00:40:13,160
My place.

672
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:25,339
You should shower first.

673
00:40:25,423 --> 00:40:28,217
You must be drenched in sweat
from taking on 20 men at once.

674
00:40:30,553 --> 00:40:33,889
It's fine. There's no need to thank me
or feel bad about it.

675
00:40:34,473 --> 00:40:35,933
All right? It's my duty to…

676
00:40:38,561 --> 00:40:39,895
Where did she go?

677
00:40:42,773 --> 00:40:45,151
Would you call that Gangnam style
or Mongolian style?

678
00:40:46,026 --> 00:40:47,611
She doesn't waste a second.

679
00:40:55,619 --> 00:40:56,662
It's me.

680
00:40:57,288 --> 00:40:59,582
Arrest those at the scene
and question them.

681
00:40:59,665 --> 00:41:01,667
They weren't your average thugs.

682
00:41:02,251 --> 00:41:03,252
Thanks.

683
00:41:06,088 --> 00:41:08,966
Hey, cop! Get me something to wear.

684
00:41:09,049 --> 00:41:10,342
Got it.

685
00:41:11,886 --> 00:41:13,512
As if I'd have any women's clothes.

686
00:41:19,351 --> 00:41:21,103
I hung it on the doorknob.

687
00:41:21,187 --> 00:41:23,063
It's mine, but that's all I have for now.

688
00:41:23,147 --> 00:41:24,148
Got it.

689
00:41:25,357 --> 00:41:27,151
Polite and rude at the same time.

690
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:45,711
Hello?

691
00:41:45,794 --> 00:41:47,630
Inspector Kang, it's Yeo Ji-hyeon.

692
00:41:48,297 --> 00:41:50,299
We found out who ordered
the attack on the gers.

693
00:41:50,382 --> 00:41:51,425
Her name is Ri Hwa-ja.

694
00:41:51,926 --> 00:41:53,594
Her real name is Lee Myung-hee.

695
00:41:53,677 --> 00:41:56,180
Her mother is Hwang Geum-ju,
the one whose number you got today.

696
00:42:00,684 --> 00:42:02,811
I had a feeling she wasn't Nam-soon,

697
00:42:03,896 --> 00:42:06,941
but she had the audacity
to lie and trick us.

698
00:42:07,024 --> 00:42:08,234
That damned brat.

699
00:42:11,362 --> 00:42:12,238
I'm home.

700
00:42:23,666 --> 00:42:24,750
Welcome back.

701
00:42:27,378 --> 00:42:28,712
You should get some rest.

702
00:42:47,898 --> 00:42:48,732
Yes?

703
00:42:48,816 --> 00:42:50,150
Is this Ms. Hwang Geum-ju?

704
00:42:50,234 --> 00:42:51,402
Yes, that's me.

705
00:42:51,485 --> 00:42:53,988
Hello, I'm Inspector Kang Hee-sik
of the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency.

706
00:42:54,071 --> 00:42:56,365
I see. What is this about?

707
00:42:56,949 --> 00:42:58,409
I hear you're looking for your daughter.

708
00:43:03,914 --> 00:43:06,125
Her name is Gang Nam-soon, correct?

709
00:43:06,709 --> 00:43:07,626
That's right.

710
00:43:07,710 --> 00:43:08,752
Is it true

711
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:11,338
that you found her?

712
00:43:13,132 --> 00:43:13,966
No.

713
00:43:15,050 --> 00:43:16,385
I thought I did,

714
00:43:16,969 --> 00:43:18,512
but she wasn't my daughter.

715
00:43:19,972 --> 00:43:21,181
I see.

716
00:43:21,265 --> 00:43:23,684
Then I'd like to pass on some information.

717
00:43:25,936 --> 00:43:27,271
Do you really have something,

718
00:43:28,397 --> 00:43:29,898
Inspector Kang?

719
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:35,904
Hello?

720
00:43:36,572 --> 00:43:40,200
Do you know my daughter, by any chance?

721
00:43:41,619 --> 00:43:42,953
I think I do.

722
00:43:44,038 --> 00:43:45,414
Where is she

723
00:43:46,624 --> 00:43:47,875
right now?

724
00:43:49,710 --> 00:43:51,420
I'll be in touch.

725
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:55,424
Where should I sleep?

726
00:43:59,136 --> 00:44:00,012
Right.

727
00:44:01,096 --> 00:44:03,724
Nam-soon, I think I found your mom.

728
00:44:17,738 --> 00:44:19,657
Hello, it's me.

729
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:20,574
Yes, Ms. Hwang.

730
00:44:20,658 --> 00:44:23,077
Get me everything on a police officer
by the name of Kang Hee-sik

731
00:44:23,577 --> 00:44:24,912
including which unit he's in.

732
00:44:24,995 --> 00:44:27,623
-And fast.
-Yes, ma'am. I'll get right on it.

733
00:44:43,097 --> 00:44:44,932
A single girl took out

734
00:44:45,474 --> 00:44:47,184
a total of 20 Korean-Chinese men?

735
00:44:47,267 --> 00:44:48,394
That's what I said.

736
00:44:48,477 --> 00:44:51,522
Not even Police Chief Park
has seen anything like this before.

737
00:44:52,648 --> 00:44:55,484
We need an independent space of our own.

738
00:44:55,984 --> 00:44:58,612
It's a nuisance to share
with a local precinct.

739
00:44:58,695 --> 00:45:00,864
How can that happen
when we're a secret unit?

740
00:45:00,948 --> 00:45:03,742
Exactly. Why did they have
to huddle us up with them

741
00:45:03,826 --> 00:45:05,702
after forming a secret task force?

742
00:45:05,786 --> 00:45:09,331
There are only
ten drug investigation units in Seoul.

743
00:45:09,998 --> 00:45:12,876
With the exponential spike
in drug-related crimes,

744
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:16,088
this secret investigation unit
was formed covertly

745
00:45:16,171 --> 00:45:18,048
as per the Commissioner General's order.

746
00:45:18,132 --> 00:45:22,302
So all we need to do
is capture and arrest Gangnam druggies.

747
00:45:22,803 --> 00:45:24,221
Don't forget that even for a second.

748
00:45:25,097 --> 00:45:27,057
Don't take an interest
in trivial cases like that.

749
00:45:27,141 --> 00:45:28,434
There's nothing trivial about it.

750
00:45:28,517 --> 00:45:31,437
Trivial, my foot. This is huge.

751
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:33,021
A girl single-handedly took them down.

752
00:45:33,647 --> 00:45:34,857
I agree it's ludicrous.

753
00:45:35,816 --> 00:45:37,651
Anyway, where are Hee-sik and Young-tak?

754
00:45:38,694 --> 00:45:39,862
It's their day off.

755
00:45:39,945 --> 00:45:41,613
They've worked for ten days straight.

756
00:45:41,697 --> 00:45:43,365
Did they find anything?

757
00:45:43,949 --> 00:45:45,033
Sir,

758
00:45:45,117 --> 00:45:47,035
just let the boys rest on their day off.

759
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:48,912
If that's what you also want,

760
00:45:49,913 --> 00:45:50,956
leave the force

761
00:45:51,582 --> 00:45:53,125
and rest until your dying day
at Seoul Station.

762
00:45:59,673 --> 00:46:00,757
This is good.

763
00:46:18,275 --> 00:46:21,403
Babe, I had the edges.

764
00:46:21,487 --> 00:46:23,655
You can have the tuna in the center.

765
00:46:30,871 --> 00:46:31,997
Really, Ms. No?

766
00:46:35,167 --> 00:46:36,627
I'm touched.

767
00:46:39,087 --> 00:46:40,088
But…

768
00:46:40,839 --> 00:46:43,592
what was once triangular is now round.

769
00:46:52,643 --> 00:46:54,811
A tear-soaked triangle gimbap.

770
00:46:54,895 --> 00:46:57,272
Let us remember this day forever.

771
00:47:00,734 --> 00:47:02,277
Eat up and go to sleep.

772
00:47:07,449 --> 00:47:09,910
Maybe we should save this for tomorrow.

773
00:47:10,536 --> 00:47:12,037
-Really?
-Yes.

774
00:47:18,752 --> 00:47:20,170
-You're cold, aren't you?
-I am.

775
00:47:23,465 --> 00:47:24,591
Thank you.

776
00:47:27,636 --> 00:47:29,179
I see the whole picture now.

777
00:47:31,098 --> 00:47:33,725
The one who ordered a hit on the gers
was your impostor.

778
00:47:33,809 --> 00:47:35,519
She must hate that you're alive.

779
00:47:35,602 --> 00:47:36,770
Your mom…

780
00:47:38,105 --> 00:47:39,898
has been looking for you for 20 years.

781
00:47:40,816 --> 00:47:42,859
She began hosting
an annual strength contest ten years ago.

782
00:47:43,485 --> 00:47:44,820
Since her daughter is strong,

783
00:47:45,946 --> 00:47:47,739
that was her way of trying to find you.

784
00:47:48,407 --> 00:47:50,534
But an impostor showed up instead.

785
00:47:51,577 --> 00:47:54,246
However, she figured out the truth.

786
00:47:56,123 --> 00:47:57,541
Are both my parents

787
00:47:58,625 --> 00:48:01,044
doing well?

788
00:48:16,518 --> 00:48:17,603
Hello?

789
00:48:17,686 --> 00:48:20,772
Ma'am, Inspector Kang is in the 36th class
of the Korean National Police University.

790
00:48:20,856 --> 00:48:23,900
He is part of a special drug task force
under the SMPA.

791
00:48:23,984 --> 00:48:26,903
The unit runs secret operations
and works out of Ganghan Police Precinct.

792
00:48:27,487 --> 00:48:29,740
A special drug task force?

793
00:48:35,078 --> 00:48:36,204
You can sleep in here.

794
00:48:37,247 --> 00:48:38,332
Where will you sleep?

795
00:48:38,915 --> 00:48:40,334
I can sleep in the other room.

796
00:48:42,002 --> 00:48:43,670
Got it. Good night.

797
00:48:49,051 --> 00:48:51,595
What's the story behind your strength?

798
00:48:53,096 --> 00:48:55,015
How can a person be that strong?

799
00:48:55,098 --> 00:48:56,224
I don't know.

800
00:48:56,933 --> 00:48:57,976
Even in Mongolia,

801
00:48:58,060 --> 00:49:00,812
I never came across
a man stronger than me.

802
00:49:00,896 --> 00:49:01,938
I think…

803
00:49:02,814 --> 00:49:04,107
you have superpowers.

804
00:49:05,192 --> 00:49:06,777
The same goes for your mom.

805
00:49:07,361 --> 00:49:08,487
My mom too?

806
00:49:09,738 --> 00:49:11,323
It's late. Get some sleep for now.

807
00:49:13,575 --> 00:49:15,452
I want to thank you

808
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:19,122
for finding my mom.

809
00:49:21,333 --> 00:49:22,584
I made a promise.

810
00:49:23,168 --> 00:49:24,795
All I did was keep it.

811
00:49:37,099 --> 00:49:38,517
This is Hwang Geum-ju.

812
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:40,977
Right. I was actually about to call you.

813
00:49:41,061 --> 00:49:42,229
Where's…

814
00:49:43,313 --> 00:49:44,648
my daughter?

815
00:49:44,731 --> 00:49:46,274
She's here with me.

816
00:49:46,942 --> 00:49:48,318
Can you put her on the phone?

817
00:49:48,860 --> 00:49:50,570
I'm pretty sure she's worn out today.

818
00:49:51,363 --> 00:49:52,698
I'd like her to rest.

819
00:49:53,699 --> 00:49:56,993
She probably won't get any sleep
if you talk to her tonight.

820
00:49:57,077 --> 00:49:58,161
Of course not.

821
00:49:59,329 --> 00:50:00,330
You're right.

822
00:50:00,872 --> 00:50:02,708
It's better that only I stay up tonight.

823
00:50:03,792 --> 00:50:04,876
Right.

824
00:50:07,170 --> 00:50:08,714
I'll text you an address

825
00:50:09,631 --> 00:50:11,425
tomorrow morning.

826
00:50:11,967 --> 00:50:14,761
Have my daughter meet me there.

827
00:50:15,345 --> 00:50:16,680
I will.

828
00:50:17,347 --> 00:50:19,182
Inspector Kang Hee-sik, was it?

829
00:50:21,309 --> 00:50:23,520
I thank you from the bottom of my heart.

830
00:50:24,646 --> 00:50:26,064
I'll forever be in your debt.

831
00:50:28,191 --> 00:50:29,192
Don't mention it.

832
00:50:29,776 --> 00:50:31,111
The pleasure was mine.

833
00:50:32,988 --> 00:50:33,989
Goodbye.

834
00:50:55,635 --> 00:50:56,678
Nam-soon.

835
00:51:15,530 --> 00:51:16,615
Hello?

836
00:51:17,324 --> 00:51:18,366
Nam-in's dad.

837
00:51:19,409 --> 00:51:20,452
I mean,

838
00:51:21,369 --> 00:51:22,537
Nam-soon's dad.

839
00:51:23,789 --> 00:51:26,583
I found our daughter Nam-soon.

840
00:51:30,045 --> 00:51:31,838
She's currently with the police.

841
00:51:32,798 --> 00:51:33,799
Are you sure?

842
00:51:38,220 --> 00:51:39,846
It seems it's real this time.

843
00:51:39,930 --> 00:51:40,806
Yes.

844
00:51:41,890 --> 00:51:43,141
It's real.

845
00:51:47,062 --> 00:51:48,522
Is she all right?

846
00:51:49,105 --> 00:51:49,981
Of course.

847
00:51:51,733 --> 00:51:52,818
She's fine.

848
00:52:06,832 --> 00:52:08,041
Nam-soon.

849
00:52:21,972 --> 00:52:23,014
Here.

850
00:52:25,225 --> 00:52:26,810
Isn't Korea amazing to live in?

851
00:52:26,893 --> 00:52:28,770
Even clothes get delivered overnight.

852
00:52:28,854 --> 00:52:32,440
You should be in nice, clean clothes
when you go to meet your parents.

853
00:52:32,524 --> 00:52:35,485
That way,
they'll know you've been doing well.

854
00:52:36,236 --> 00:52:37,237
Got it.

855
00:52:41,241 --> 00:52:42,242
Hey.

856
00:52:42,325 --> 00:52:43,869
-The bathroom.
-Okay.

857
00:52:49,833 --> 00:52:50,792
Ta-da.

858
00:52:51,877 --> 00:52:52,961
I'll be off.

859
00:52:53,044 --> 00:52:54,462
Okay. Good luck.

860
00:53:03,471 --> 00:53:04,556
Bye.

861
00:53:21,489 --> 00:53:23,241
DIU OH YOUNG-TAK

862
00:53:23,325 --> 00:53:24,326
Hey, Young-tak.

863
00:53:24,409 --> 00:53:27,537
None of the evidence we submitted
tested positive for drugs.

864
00:53:27,621 --> 00:53:28,455
Really?

865
00:53:28,538 --> 00:53:30,040
Is there anything else you found?

866
00:53:30,123 --> 00:53:31,583
I do have something,

867
00:53:31,666 --> 00:53:32,834
but I don't think it's it.

868
00:53:39,633 --> 00:53:41,676
I think I found it, Young-tak.

869
00:53:53,188 --> 00:53:54,272
Nam-soon.

870
00:54:13,291 --> 00:54:16,544
-Fire!
-There's a fire!

871
00:54:31,017 --> 00:54:35,146
Help me!

872
00:54:35,230 --> 00:54:38,942
Someone, please help…

873
00:55:04,009 --> 00:55:06,219
We're running a bit late.
Will that be all right?

874
00:55:07,470 --> 00:55:08,555
It's not all right.

875
00:55:12,976 --> 00:55:14,310
There seems to be a fire.

876
00:55:25,488 --> 00:55:28,366
There are children in there.
What do we do?

877
00:55:28,450 --> 00:55:29,534
I see children up there.

878
00:55:29,617 --> 00:55:31,411
-Oh, dear.
-Please help us!

879
00:55:33,079 --> 00:55:34,539
What do we do?

880
00:55:58,063 --> 00:55:59,272
Help!

881
00:56:00,565 --> 00:56:01,775
Hey.

882
00:56:01,858 --> 00:56:03,068
Are you all right?

883
00:56:03,151 --> 00:56:04,861
I'll get you out of here. Come on.

884
00:56:23,171 --> 00:56:24,214
Let's go.

885
00:57:01,167 --> 00:57:03,169
FIRE RESCUE

886
00:57:37,412 --> 00:57:38,746
Mommy's here. It's all right.

887
00:58:09,944 --> 00:58:11,070
My baby.

888
00:58:25,376 --> 00:58:26,711
Nam-soon!

889
00:58:52,820 --> 00:58:53,905
The fire truck is here!

890
00:59:39,284 --> 00:59:40,285
Nam-soon?

891
00:59:44,205 --> 00:59:45,290
Mom?

892
00:59:53,464 --> 00:59:54,507
Come here.

893
00:59:55,341 --> 00:59:56,509
Come on.

894
01:00:19,574 --> 01:00:20,867
Nam-soon!

895
01:00:39,719 --> 01:00:41,888
SPECIAL THANKS TO PARK BO-YOUNG
AND PARK HYUNG-SIK

896
01:01:12,669 --> 01:01:15,088
STRONG GIRL NAM-SOON

897
01:01:15,171 --> 01:01:17,173
I don't know what I'm supposed to do.

898
01:01:17,256 --> 01:01:18,341
I never liked studying.

899
01:01:18,424 --> 01:01:19,717
You truly are just like me.

900
01:01:19,801 --> 01:01:22,345
You ladies are only built for strength.
You're not so bright.

901
01:01:22,428 --> 01:01:23,262
Shut it, Bong-go.

902
01:01:23,346 --> 01:01:25,723
I want to be of help to someone.

903
01:01:25,807 --> 01:01:27,558
Everyone has a shortage of something.

904
01:01:27,642 --> 01:01:28,726
Tell me what you want.

905
01:01:28,810 --> 01:01:30,144
I'd like to catch
the mastermind behind it.

906
01:01:30,228 --> 01:01:32,146
You sure are an impressive detective.

907
01:01:32,230 --> 01:01:33,648
There are drugs at Doogo.

908
01:01:33,731 --> 01:01:35,983
Sir, I think I have to go undercover.

909
01:01:36,067 --> 01:01:37,110
I received a tip,

910
01:01:37,193 --> 01:01:38,986
and the follow-up proved it was solid.

911
01:01:39,070 --> 01:01:41,155
-Where?
-Somewhere that could have drugs.

912
01:01:41,239 --> 01:01:43,533
Let's wrap this up quickly
and get inside the warehouse.

913
01:01:43,616 --> 01:01:45,159
You said you had drugs to find.

914
01:01:46,619 --> 01:01:51,624
