1
00:00:42,667 --> 00:00:45,962
STRONG GIRL NAM-SOON

2
00:00:56,514 --> 00:00:57,891
Damn it. Hee-sik.

3
00:00:57,974 --> 00:00:59,642
Agent Gang was caught
by the Russian bodyguard.

4
00:00:59,726 --> 00:01:00,560
What?

5
00:01:01,811 --> 00:01:03,396
Jeez, that startled me.

6
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:04,564
What the hell?

7
00:01:07,192 --> 00:01:08,109
Hey, Gang Nam…

8
00:01:08,193 --> 00:01:09,069
Hey!

9
00:01:16,242 --> 00:01:17,494
Gang Nam-soon!

10
00:01:18,328 --> 00:01:19,329
Stop!

11
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:21,915
I said stop!

12
00:01:24,918 --> 00:01:25,877
Hey!

13
00:01:28,546 --> 00:01:29,589
Is this for real?

14
00:01:37,889 --> 00:01:38,973
Forget Black Widow.

15
00:01:39,057 --> 00:01:40,183
She's Sadako from The Ring.

16
00:01:47,649 --> 00:01:50,485
So this was your grand plan?

17
00:01:50,568 --> 00:01:52,320
Stealing the whole computer?

18
00:01:52,403 --> 00:01:53,446
Yeah.

19
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,991
And here I thought
you had some brilliant master plan.

20
00:01:57,075 --> 00:01:58,493
You know you got caught, right?

21
00:01:58,576 --> 00:02:00,203
I got caught and then some.

22
00:02:00,745 --> 00:02:02,247
Don't worry though.

23
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:04,958
I wore a disguise for a very good reason.

24
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:08,211
Could I be more thorough? I'm the best.

25
00:02:08,294 --> 00:02:09,921
No, you're not.

26
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:12,632
Give me your hand.

27
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:17,095
Why did I let you go in there alone?

28
00:02:18,429 --> 00:02:20,849
I only have myself to blame.

29
00:02:20,932 --> 00:02:21,975
Pavel.

30
00:02:22,058 --> 00:02:24,185
The Russian mafia group
that trained Ryu Si-o.

31
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:27,355
I hear it runs a vast drug network.

32
00:02:28,064 --> 00:02:29,274
If that's the case,

33
00:02:29,941 --> 00:02:33,111
their drug operations would run
on a scale beyond our imagination.

34
00:02:33,736 --> 00:02:34,571
Gan I-sik.

35
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:39,909
While you look into that computer,
I'll dig into their connections.

36
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:46,708
Come here.

37
00:02:48,084 --> 00:02:50,253
Some lousy ghost you are.

38
00:03:09,898 --> 00:03:12,317
So what happened
to your daughter afterward?

39
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:14,152
In Kenya, I mean.

40
00:03:14,235 --> 00:03:17,155
What happened after she bought
the diplomat's burned-down residence?

41
00:03:17,238 --> 00:03:18,197
Tell me already.

42
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:20,116
Why does that pique your interest?

43
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:21,743
Please tell me.

44
00:03:21,826 --> 00:03:22,952
I can't watch TV dramas

45
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:24,704
because I can't stand cliffhangers.

46
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:28,333
You really should learn
to be more patient.

47
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:30,251
Joong-gan, please.

48
00:03:31,252 --> 00:03:35,423
My Jun-hee,
who has a trendy name despite his age.

49
00:03:35,506 --> 00:03:36,549
You win.

50
00:03:37,425 --> 00:03:40,386
After knocking down the burned residence,

51
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:42,680
she had people
build a new house on its land.

52
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:55,944
What on earth?

53
00:03:56,027 --> 00:03:58,738
That spot of land
turned out to be an oil deposit.

54
00:03:59,405 --> 00:04:01,032
From then on,

55
00:04:01,115 --> 00:04:03,368
she began raking in money
like nobody's business.

56
00:04:03,451 --> 00:04:06,621
Her story is more dramatic
than any story I've heard of.

57
00:04:06,704 --> 00:04:09,624
-But that's not the end of it!
-What?

58
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:12,460
Please finish the story!

59
00:04:16,631 --> 00:04:17,632
Dad?

60
00:04:19,425 --> 00:04:22,929
You're heading to Korea?

61
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:27,892
Where have you been,

62
00:04:27,976 --> 00:04:29,811
and what have you been up to
all this time?

63
00:04:32,355 --> 00:04:33,648
All right.

64
00:04:35,149 --> 00:04:36,609
Let me know when you're arriving

65
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:39,862
once you've booked your flight.

66
00:04:40,989 --> 00:04:42,532
I'll send someone to the airport.

67
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:45,535
Sure.

68
00:04:53,751 --> 00:04:57,213
"On the verge of reaching out
toward the climax…"

69
00:05:03,845 --> 00:05:04,721
Hey, Geum-ju.

70
00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:05,722
Dad…

71
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:07,807
just called.

72
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:09,142
Right, Dad called.

73
00:05:11,102 --> 00:05:12,478
Did you say "Dad"?

74
00:05:12,562 --> 00:05:13,938
He's coming to Korea.

75
00:05:14,022 --> 00:05:15,231
Hold on.

76
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:17,567
Where was he and what has he been up to?

77
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:18,609
He was in Tibet

78
00:05:19,277 --> 00:05:21,279
being a guru or whatever it was called.

79
00:05:21,863 --> 00:05:23,614
I didn't ask for details.

80
00:05:25,241 --> 00:05:26,576
I feel faint.

81
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:27,702
This is too much.

82
00:05:29,203 --> 00:05:30,288
Geum-ju,

83
00:05:30,371 --> 00:05:32,623
it's good that he's alive,

84
00:05:32,707 --> 00:05:34,917
but why do I feel so nervous
all of a sudden?

85
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:36,085
What about Mom?

86
00:05:37,378 --> 00:05:39,297
She'll be known as a cheater.

87
00:05:39,881 --> 00:05:43,676
Her current relationship is burning hot
like a boiler on high heat.

88
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:44,844
What do we do?

89
00:05:44,927 --> 00:05:46,471
What do you mean?

90
00:05:46,554 --> 00:05:48,056
As if you need to ask that.

91
00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:49,015
You.

92
00:05:49,557 --> 00:05:52,560
Don't even think about
breathing a word of this to Mom.

93
00:05:53,436 --> 00:05:54,520
A word.

94
00:05:57,982 --> 00:05:58,983
Dad?

95
00:06:01,277 --> 00:06:02,236
Dad…

96
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:15,750
I'm done caring about what others think.

97
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:18,920
If people tell me to act my age,

98
00:06:19,003 --> 00:06:21,506
I'll treat you even better, Joong-gan,

99
00:06:21,589 --> 00:06:22,840
for the whole world to see.

100
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:25,093
Oh, Jun-hee.

101
00:06:33,601 --> 00:06:34,602
That seems terrifying.

102
00:06:38,523 --> 00:06:39,732
What the hell?

103
00:06:39,816 --> 00:06:42,860
Ma'am, we've been in line all along.

104
00:06:42,944 --> 00:06:44,529
You must've forgotten.

105
00:06:44,612 --> 00:06:45,905
It's all right.

106
00:06:45,988 --> 00:06:49,450
My grandma has been having trouble
with her memory as well.

107
00:06:50,326 --> 00:06:51,536
-Look here.
-Hey.

108
00:06:51,619 --> 00:06:53,496
We were first in line.

109
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:55,790
Why do old people
want to ride this anyway?

110
00:06:56,749 --> 00:06:58,668
You should watch your blood pressure.

111
00:07:00,294 --> 00:07:01,420
Wait.

112
00:07:02,046 --> 00:07:04,966
Let's not quarrel with them
and get on a different ride.

113
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:06,968
Sweetie,

114
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:10,513
I won't quarrel with them.
Don't you worry.

115
00:07:17,854 --> 00:07:18,688
What the…

116
00:07:20,815 --> 00:07:21,774
Hey!

117
00:07:22,358 --> 00:07:23,192
Hey.

118
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:25,570
-When did he get there?
-Hey, are you okay?

119
00:07:25,653 --> 00:07:27,738
Sweetie, let's skip these rides

120
00:07:27,822 --> 00:07:29,532
and do something more classic.

121
00:07:29,615 --> 00:07:31,909
-Sorry?
-"Catch me if you can."

122
00:07:31,993 --> 00:07:33,536
But instead,

123
00:07:34,412 --> 00:07:36,664
I'm coming to catch you!

124
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,377
Joong-gan, don't run down
the middle of the path!

125
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:42,295
You'll hurt yourself!

126
00:07:42,378 --> 00:07:44,338
No way! I'm running down the middle!

127
00:08:08,696 --> 00:08:09,989
Nam-in.

128
00:08:12,241 --> 00:08:15,244
You'd look really amazing
if you lost a little more weight.

129
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:17,997
Why don't you take another pill?

130
00:08:19,248 --> 00:08:20,416
Just one more.

131
00:08:21,792 --> 00:08:23,085
Just one.

132
00:09:09,131 --> 00:09:12,218
Losers won't get to eat

133
00:09:12,301 --> 00:09:14,679
and will end up starving to death.

134
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,986
Knock me over when I give you the signal.

135
00:09:33,447 --> 00:09:34,699
You haven't had food in a while.

136
00:09:37,493 --> 00:09:39,704
What's your name?

137
00:09:40,288 --> 00:09:41,205
Binbin.

138
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:53,259
EPISODE 9
THE ROOT OF VICE

139
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:58,264
I'm guessing you didn't know,

140
00:09:58,764 --> 00:10:01,851
but Lee Myung-hee
attacked Nam-soon at Doogo.

141
00:10:03,394 --> 00:10:05,605
Mom, did you ask for me?

142
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:11,319
Nam-soon,

143
00:10:11,402 --> 00:10:12,320
I heard…

144
00:10:13,487 --> 00:10:16,032
that Hwa-ja nearly got you injured.

145
00:10:18,659 --> 00:10:19,869
Are you all right?

146
00:10:21,912 --> 00:10:22,747
Yeah.

147
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:36,218
Where is she right now?

148
00:11:05,623 --> 00:11:06,582
Why?

149
00:11:08,709 --> 00:11:09,710
Answer me.

150
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:12,421
Why did you do it?

151
00:11:14,882 --> 00:11:16,133
Because I hated her.

152
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:20,221
If she hadn't shown up…

153
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:25,976
I could've stayed as your daughter.

154
00:11:27,311 --> 00:11:29,438
Gang Nam-soon stole…

155
00:11:31,148 --> 00:11:32,525
everything from me.

156
00:11:32,608 --> 00:11:34,485
Do you blame the world?

157
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:38,406
Do you also blame God?

158
00:11:41,075 --> 00:11:42,827
Then make God take your side.

159
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:47,540
Shall I tell you what I mean by that?

160
00:11:50,292 --> 00:11:52,128
Repent from the heart.

161
00:11:53,838 --> 00:11:55,005
Atone for your wrongs.

162
00:11:57,967 --> 00:11:59,260
Then God,

163
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:00,886
as well as I…

164
00:12:02,513 --> 00:12:04,223
will forgive you.

165
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:09,478
Myung-hee.

166
00:12:11,897 --> 00:12:13,566
Try living an honest life.

167
00:12:17,361 --> 00:12:18,446
You can…

168
00:12:20,114 --> 00:12:21,949
be my daughter as well.

169
00:12:35,337 --> 00:12:36,755
LIST OF EXPORTS,
GLOBAL LOGISTICS MANAGEMENT

170
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:40,718
Hey, Ms. Baek.

171
00:12:42,803 --> 00:12:45,514
What items does Doogo ship abroad?

172
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:50,060
There are buyers connected to
the international market

173
00:12:50,561 --> 00:12:52,104
who do business with Doogo, right?

174
00:12:52,188 --> 00:12:54,148
Stop talking to me like I'm your peer.

175
00:12:54,231 --> 00:12:55,524
But you're younger than me.

176
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:57,860
Doesn't that give me the right to do so?

177
00:12:57,943 --> 00:12:58,777
What?

178
00:12:58,861 --> 00:13:02,156
You're obviously younger than I am.

179
00:13:02,239 --> 00:13:04,575
Anyone could tell that.

180
00:13:04,658 --> 00:13:06,368
Ms. Baek was born in 1980.

181
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:07,620
She's middle-aged.

182
00:13:07,703 --> 00:13:09,830
Who are you to reveal one's age,

183
00:13:09,914 --> 00:13:10,873
sir?

184
00:13:14,043 --> 00:13:15,252
That's crazy.

185
00:13:16,212 --> 00:13:17,505
I thought you were younger than me.

186
00:13:19,131 --> 00:13:20,382
Stop that.

187
00:13:24,428 --> 00:13:26,096
A computer from Mr. Ryu's office
was stolen.

188
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:28,182
Secure all of your team's files.

189
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:31,310
Secure files…

190
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:36,982
Security thinks someone hacked
the security camera system.

191
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:39,610
All of yesterday's footage was erased,

192
00:13:40,194 --> 00:13:42,488
and recovering it will be difficult.

193
00:13:43,155 --> 00:13:45,324
I checked where Kyle said
the culprit landed,

194
00:13:45,407 --> 00:13:46,534
but it was a blind spot.

195
00:13:46,617 --> 00:13:49,453
There's a camera
at the intersection though,

196
00:13:49,537 --> 00:13:50,704
so I requested the footage.

197
00:13:57,253 --> 00:13:59,296
I'll keep tracking the leads.

198
00:14:06,303 --> 00:14:08,389
Failing to guard the office

199
00:14:08,472 --> 00:14:10,849
is the same as failing to protect me.

200
00:14:12,434 --> 00:14:14,853
Didn't I constantly remind you

201
00:14:15,771 --> 00:14:17,523
to secure the office at all times?

202
00:14:17,606 --> 00:14:18,983
I apologize.

203
00:14:19,066 --> 00:14:20,442
I apologize.

204
00:14:26,907 --> 00:14:28,617
Who could've stolen my computer?

205
00:14:31,912 --> 00:14:34,039
Who dared to sneak into my office?

206
00:14:35,624 --> 00:14:37,960
I want to know

207
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:41,881
who truly bankrolls Doogo.

208
00:14:41,964 --> 00:14:44,466
Not the shareholders on the list,

209
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:47,386
but the one who bankrolls the company.

210
00:14:49,096 --> 00:14:51,724
You destroyed all the bearer certificates
related to Doogo,

211
00:14:52,474 --> 00:14:53,350
didn't you?

212
00:14:53,434 --> 00:14:54,518
Yes, sir.

213
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:57,730
You wanted the files read and destroyed
the day they were shared.

214
00:14:58,314 --> 00:14:59,607
We've been doing as ordered.

215
00:15:09,116 --> 00:15:10,993
It's as clean as a whistle.

216
00:15:11,535 --> 00:15:12,828
He doesn't even watch porn.

217
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:15,873
I knew something seemed off
about this guy.

218
00:15:15,956 --> 00:15:17,583
This is the only file on his computer.

219
00:15:21,545 --> 00:15:24,298
Is he a sentimental mobster or what?

220
00:15:24,381 --> 00:15:26,091
Are you kidding me?

221
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:27,676
Nam-soon may be right.

222
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:31,347
I doubt he founded a company,
issued its own cryptocurrency,

223
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:33,307
and expanded globally
just to reign over Korea.

224
00:15:33,891 --> 00:15:37,978
His real objective could've always been
to take over the international scene.

225
00:15:38,062 --> 00:15:39,521
He's expanding the playing field

226
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:41,440
since there's more than enough
to go around in Korea.

227
00:15:41,523 --> 00:15:43,651
If he were distributing them
through regular channels,

228
00:15:43,734 --> 00:15:45,152
he wouldn't need to keep encrypted data.

229
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:48,155
Why bother when the drugs
aren't detectable anyway?

230
00:15:49,239 --> 00:15:50,074
Just a second.

231
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:52,451
He always goes off on his own.

232
00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:04,296
Goodness, Hee-ja!

233
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:05,673
What's up?

234
00:16:05,756 --> 00:16:07,883
I'm at work right now.

235
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:08,884
"Hee-ja"?

236
00:16:09,885 --> 00:16:10,719
Whatever.

237
00:16:11,261 --> 00:16:13,097
We found nothing on Ryu Si-o's computer.

238
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:16,475
What? I practically spoon-fed it to you!

239
00:16:16,558 --> 00:16:18,018
How could you…

240
00:16:18,936 --> 00:16:21,105
have gotten nothing?

241
00:16:22,022 --> 00:16:23,565
What now?

242
00:16:25,526 --> 00:16:26,860
What should we do?

243
00:16:32,074 --> 00:16:33,409
Are you sure nothing's on it?

244
00:16:35,035 --> 00:16:37,329
It was such a big computer.

245
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:39,164
The corporate relations team you're on

246
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:41,709
-manages international deals, right?
-Yeah.

247
00:16:41,792 --> 00:16:42,960
Let's look into that.

248
00:16:43,043 --> 00:16:44,086
Okay.

249
00:16:45,295 --> 00:16:47,548
My investigation is heading
in that direction too.

250
00:16:49,466 --> 00:16:51,510
Don't steal another computer

251
00:16:51,593 --> 00:16:54,805
and just get us a list this time around.

252
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:59,018
There's a good chance
the operation is being run openly.

253
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:00,936
I see we're on the same page.

254
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:01,854
Nice.

255
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:24,293
This…

256
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:27,546
is handmade in the literal sense.

257
00:17:28,213 --> 00:17:30,966
Everything is better with the human touch.

258
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:31,925
You know how it is.

259
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:34,261
Potato pancakes taste better
when you grate the potatoes.

260
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:39,725
I crushed some beans
to give you a helping hand.

261
00:17:39,808 --> 00:17:40,976
Should I keep going?

262
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,352
It's okay.

263
00:17:44,104 --> 00:17:45,397
Joong-gan,

264
00:17:45,481 --> 00:17:48,650
you should give
these beautiful hands a rest.

265
00:17:49,777 --> 00:17:51,111
Oh, you.

266
00:17:51,195 --> 00:17:54,490
But I find that
it's a good stress reliever.

267
00:17:58,952 --> 00:17:59,787
By the way,

268
00:18:00,788 --> 00:18:04,291
Mr. Gang hasn't called
or shown up for work.

269
00:18:44,832 --> 00:18:46,041
Ms. Baek.

270
00:18:46,667 --> 00:18:48,961
Ms. Baek.

271
00:18:49,044 --> 00:18:50,838
Ms. Baek.

272
00:18:52,172 --> 00:18:54,007
How sweet of you.

273
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:56,802
I'm terribly sorry.

274
00:18:56,885 --> 00:19:00,097
I made that mistake
because you looked so young.

275
00:19:00,889 --> 00:19:02,224
It's understandable.

276
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:03,934
We all make mistakes in life.

277
00:19:09,106 --> 00:19:09,940
Ms. Baek,

278
00:19:10,023 --> 00:19:12,776
I want to do well at my job
and get recognition.

279
00:19:14,236 --> 00:19:18,615
That's why I want to know
what items Doogo ships abroad.

280
00:19:19,199 --> 00:19:20,075
No.

281
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:21,994
That's off-limits for new hires.

282
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:26,582
But Si-o told me to learn the ropes
as soon as possible.

283
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:28,083
If I don't, I'll get the boot.

284
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:30,419
Still, that's a no.

285
00:19:44,641 --> 00:19:46,768
WILL DOOGO'S GLOBAL EXPANSION
BE A SUCCESS?

286
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:49,855
THE SECRET TO CEO RYU SI-O'S
SALES OF 40 MILLION DOLLARS

287
00:19:49,938 --> 00:19:51,773
Forty million dollars?

288
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:54,693
What could've driven the sales
of a non-manufacturing business?

289
00:19:55,903 --> 00:19:57,196
How much is 40 million dollars?

290
00:19:57,821 --> 00:20:00,282
Around 40… No, 50 billion won.

291
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:02,534
Something's definitely going on
at this place.

292
00:20:15,464 --> 00:20:17,674
You know Heritage Club's client list
Agent Gang got us?

293
00:20:17,758 --> 00:20:19,760
Even the Commissioner General was on it.

294
00:20:19,843 --> 00:20:20,844
No way.

295
00:20:20,928 --> 00:20:23,555
I hear he'll go into politics
when his term ends this year.

296
00:20:23,639 --> 00:20:25,265
I bet he needed some solid connections.

297
00:20:25,349 --> 00:20:28,352
The political circle
has long been trying to get him in office.

298
00:20:28,435 --> 00:20:31,355
I'm going to check out Heritage Club.

299
00:20:31,438 --> 00:20:33,482
There will be leads there as well.

300
00:20:36,193 --> 00:20:37,694
Where's the team leader?

301
00:20:37,778 --> 00:20:39,529
He's helping the Busan DIU out.

302
00:20:39,613 --> 00:20:40,614
Hold on.

303
00:20:41,114 --> 00:20:42,532
How will you gain access to Heritage?

304
00:20:42,616 --> 00:20:44,493
It's not some random club in Gangnam.

305
00:20:45,452 --> 00:20:46,787
Do you have connections?

306
00:20:48,538 --> 00:20:50,666
As for connections…

307
00:20:52,459 --> 00:20:53,377
I sure do.

308
00:20:55,671 --> 00:20:58,382
It's party time.

309
00:21:04,346 --> 00:21:06,974
Here are the plate numbers of the cars
owned by Ms. Hwang and her companies.

310
00:21:07,057 --> 00:21:08,725
None have been around Doogo.

311
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:13,563
Describe who you saw.

312
00:21:13,647 --> 00:21:16,566
The person was in a white gown

313
00:21:17,818 --> 00:21:19,903
and was wearing a wig
to look like a ghost.

314
00:21:20,737 --> 00:21:21,863
In terms of height…

315
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:26,285
they were about…

316
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:37,879
About as tall as her.

317
00:21:44,928 --> 00:21:46,221
Hwang Geum-ju's daughter.

318
00:21:46,763 --> 00:21:48,265
She was lost and then found.

319
00:21:48,348 --> 00:21:49,266
And she's strong.

320
00:21:49,349 --> 00:21:50,183
Yes, sir.

321
00:21:50,267 --> 00:21:51,893
Have you checked Tsetseg's résumé?

322
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:54,062
Yes, she's here on a H-1 visa,

323
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:55,897
and the name on her passport
is Khan Tsetseg.

324
00:21:56,481 --> 00:21:57,983
-Should I dig deeper?
-No.

325
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:00,277
I'll do it myself.

326
00:22:04,656 --> 00:22:05,490
You can…

327
00:22:07,492 --> 00:22:09,286
be my daughter as well.

328
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:21,798
Ms. Lee Myung-hee, you have a visitor.

329
00:22:36,938 --> 00:22:37,981
Relax.

330
00:22:38,815 --> 00:22:40,692
I'm not here regarding your fake ID.

331
00:22:43,153 --> 00:22:44,237
Gang Nam-soon.

332
00:22:45,906 --> 00:22:47,324
You know who she is, don't you?

333
00:22:50,452 --> 00:22:52,788
If you tell me everything,

334
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:55,415
I'll help keep you out of prison.

335
00:22:59,544 --> 00:23:00,420
As in what?

336
00:23:02,255 --> 00:23:05,050
An impostor of Hwang Geum-ju's daughter
must know some things.

337
00:23:07,177 --> 00:23:08,595
Is Tsetseg…

338
00:23:10,806 --> 00:23:11,890
her real daughter?

339
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:17,604
Is Tsetseg…

340
00:23:20,107 --> 00:23:21,858
Gang Nam-soon?

341
00:23:25,737 --> 00:23:28,156
You wanted to kill the real daughter
after she resurfaced.

342
00:23:34,329 --> 00:23:35,163
No.

343
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:39,167
She's not Gang Nam-soon.

344
00:23:40,293 --> 00:23:42,212
I haven't seen her
at any of the strength contests.

345
00:23:43,547 --> 00:23:47,050
Have you seen
Hwang Geum-ju's real daughter?

346
00:23:49,177 --> 00:23:50,637
Tell me the truth,

347
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:51,888
or you might have to pay…

348
00:23:53,598 --> 00:23:54,766
with your life.

349
00:24:00,897 --> 00:24:01,815
Yes,

350
00:24:02,399 --> 00:24:03,233
I've seen her before.

351
00:24:05,735 --> 00:24:06,736
Tsetseg…

352
00:24:08,446 --> 00:24:09,322
isn't her.

353
00:24:12,617 --> 00:24:13,869
The real daughter

354
00:24:14,995 --> 00:24:16,371
isn't fluent in Korean.

355
00:24:21,585 --> 00:24:22,919
Is what you said

356
00:24:23,503 --> 00:24:24,504
the truth?

357
00:24:24,588 --> 00:24:25,881
Why would I risk my life

358
00:24:27,007 --> 00:24:28,925
and lie for a nobody like Tsetseg?

359
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:32,596
If you're done, I'll get going.

360
00:24:33,805 --> 00:24:35,348
Then why did you try to kill her?

361
00:24:36,308 --> 00:24:37,809
You tried to stab her.

362
00:24:41,605 --> 00:24:42,898
She talked down to me.

363
00:24:47,527 --> 00:24:49,279
I told her not to,

364
00:24:50,614 --> 00:24:51,781
but she wouldn't stop.

365
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:56,786
I loathe people who talk down to me.

366
00:24:58,121 --> 00:24:59,873
If she were Gang Nam-soon,

367
00:25:00,916 --> 00:25:03,043
I would've killed her ages ago.

368
00:25:08,298 --> 00:25:09,299
All right.

369
00:25:10,008 --> 00:25:11,092
You may head back in.

370
00:25:12,886 --> 00:25:15,222
Here are photos of Pavel
and his organization.

371
00:25:15,805 --> 00:25:16,640
Pavel.

372
00:25:16,723 --> 00:25:19,142
Pavel is the Russian mafia group

373
00:25:19,226 --> 00:25:22,312
formed in 1954
by the Hungarian gangster Tagore Pavel.

374
00:25:22,395 --> 00:25:26,399
It started off as a criminal group dealing
in drugs, prostitution, and gambling.

375
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:32,739
But that changed
when Sabaki took over in the '80s.

376
00:25:33,531 --> 00:25:35,784
He was a Yemeni orphan
who became a white-collar worker

377
00:25:35,867 --> 00:25:37,911
after graduating from the prestigious
University of Kent.

378
00:25:38,495 --> 00:25:41,414
As soon as he took over Pavel,
he dived into the hotel business.

379
00:25:42,207 --> 00:25:43,250
Since then,

380
00:25:43,333 --> 00:25:45,961
Pavel has become the predominant
mafia group involved in casinos.

381
00:25:46,586 --> 00:25:48,463
It became a powerhouse
in the black money market

382
00:25:48,546 --> 00:25:51,049
and started fostering white-collar members
based on that success.

383
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:55,595
Recently, a powerful heir
has appeared on the scene.

384
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:56,972
Code name, Nozh.

385
00:25:57,055 --> 00:25:58,265
A person yet to be identified.

386
00:25:58,348 --> 00:25:59,474
Nozh?

387
00:25:59,557 --> 00:26:01,393
That's the Russian word for knife.

388
00:26:01,476 --> 00:26:02,727
How did you know that?

389
00:26:02,811 --> 00:26:04,437
I run a pawnshop, remember?

390
00:26:05,188 --> 00:26:07,732
I've bought and sold
many old Russian swords.

391
00:26:07,816 --> 00:26:09,359
Sabaki was indeed a genius,

392
00:26:09,442 --> 00:26:11,319
but he was frequently ill.

393
00:26:11,403 --> 00:26:15,115
That must be why they reverted to choosing
a typical gangster as the heir.

394
00:26:15,198 --> 00:26:18,702
Are all members of Pavel orphans?

395
00:26:19,286 --> 00:26:20,203
Yes.

396
00:26:20,954 --> 00:26:23,123
Orphans are kidnapped or imported

397
00:26:23,665 --> 00:26:24,791
and trained as human weapons

398
00:26:26,084 --> 00:26:27,502
under a rigorous system.

399
00:27:21,181 --> 00:27:22,307
Are you okay?

400
00:27:26,519 --> 00:27:29,397
They jumped down from there and ran off.

401
00:27:30,106 --> 00:27:33,109
A jump like that should've killed them,

402
00:27:33,193 --> 00:27:34,402
but they just disappeared.

403
00:27:35,153 --> 00:27:36,654
The security cameras didn't work either.

404
00:27:38,198 --> 00:27:40,367
But I know what I saw.

405
00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:44,037
It was a ghost with the most hideous face.

406
00:27:44,621 --> 00:27:47,582
I don't know why,
but I somehow feel offended

407
00:27:48,083 --> 00:27:49,459
even though I don't understand you.

408
00:27:53,088 --> 00:27:54,547
Get on my back.

409
00:27:54,631 --> 00:27:56,007
What are you on about?

410
00:27:56,091 --> 00:27:57,258
Get on my back.

411
00:27:57,342 --> 00:27:58,593
Are you being serious?

412
00:28:16,611 --> 00:28:17,445
Here.

413
00:28:30,917 --> 00:28:32,794
You're obviously stronger,

414
00:28:32,877 --> 00:28:35,046
so why did you take the beating
rather than fighting back?

415
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:37,006
I must obey him.

416
00:28:38,591 --> 00:28:40,593
Why would you protect someone like him?

417
00:28:41,928 --> 00:28:44,681
You must know that Ryu Si-o does drugs.

418
00:28:46,224 --> 00:28:47,642
Do you also take them?

419
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:49,018
No, I don't.

420
00:28:49,102 --> 00:28:49,936
Why not?

421
00:28:50,019 --> 00:28:52,063
My job is to protect the boss.

422
00:28:52,647 --> 00:28:54,649
That's some professionalism.

423
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:56,401
How cool of you. I respect that.

424
00:29:00,029 --> 00:29:01,489
The CEO uses the drug?

425
00:29:02,031 --> 00:29:04,826
But most drug lords
steer clear of their own products.

426
00:29:05,952 --> 00:29:08,455
But how is he staying unaffected?

427
00:29:08,538 --> 00:29:09,664
Others wound up dead.

428
00:29:18,506 --> 00:29:19,716
Where are you?

429
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:33,646
I called because we need to go somewhere.

430
00:29:34,147 --> 00:29:36,399
Kyle isn't in the best shape today,

431
00:29:36,483 --> 00:29:37,609
so I'll act as your bodyguard.

432
00:29:38,359 --> 00:29:39,194
Sure.

433
00:29:40,528 --> 00:29:42,030
How is your Korean this good?

434
00:29:42,113 --> 00:29:44,908
It was my goal to come to Korea.

435
00:29:45,492 --> 00:29:46,868
So I studied hard to master Korean.

436
00:29:46,951 --> 00:29:48,703
Why did you want to come here?

437
00:29:53,082 --> 00:29:56,127
To marry a Korean man.

438
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:00,590
-Let's go.
-Sure.

439
00:30:34,165 --> 00:30:35,166
Careful.

440
00:30:36,292 --> 00:30:37,460
Place them down.

441
00:31:00,942 --> 00:31:02,569
This is the Director of New Media at TGV,

442
00:31:02,652 --> 00:31:04,821
a company that will soon be my subsidiary.

443
00:31:04,904 --> 00:31:08,116
I brought him here
since he might become a member.

444
00:31:08,658 --> 00:31:11,160
I can personally vouch for him.

445
00:31:13,413 --> 00:31:14,581
Hello,

446
00:31:14,664 --> 00:31:16,875
I'm Jamie Choi.

447
00:31:16,958 --> 00:31:18,918
It's a pleasure to meet you, Mr. Choi.

448
00:31:22,297 --> 00:31:23,214
This way, please.

449
00:32:10,303 --> 00:32:11,387
Hello.

450
00:32:12,013 --> 00:32:13,014
I'm Hwang Geum-ju.

451
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:17,477
I'm Hillary.

452
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:19,270
It's a pleasure to meet you.

453
00:32:19,354 --> 00:32:20,355
Likewise.

454
00:32:22,607 --> 00:32:24,067
You're a pretty one.

455
00:32:24,651 --> 00:32:25,985
Thank you.

456
00:32:26,069 --> 00:32:29,280
Your beauty is mesmerizing, Ms. Hwang.

457
00:32:32,116 --> 00:32:34,827
She's the lobbyist
who'll officially be aiding me.

458
00:32:34,911 --> 00:32:36,329
I see.

459
00:32:38,665 --> 00:32:39,540
This man here

460
00:32:40,249 --> 00:32:41,626
has been advising me

461
00:32:41,709 --> 00:32:45,338
in my acquisition of TGV,
the broadcasting company.

462
00:32:45,421 --> 00:32:48,883
Allow me to introduce
Jamie Choi, the M&A expert.

463
00:32:50,468 --> 00:32:51,511
Hello.

464
00:32:54,597 --> 00:32:55,431
Hello.

465
00:32:56,265 --> 00:32:58,434
I'm Jamie Choi.

466
00:33:23,543 --> 00:33:24,502
Here, ma'am.

467
00:33:30,133 --> 00:33:31,092
Don't be cheeky.

468
00:33:31,175 --> 00:33:33,136
What can you do about it?

469
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:44,564
Well…

470
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:48,985
Please excuse me
while I go to the restroom.

471
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:14,635
Why didn't you tell me the VIP canceled?

472
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:16,763
I wasn't informed of it.

473
00:34:16,846 --> 00:34:18,806
I just can't believe this mess.

474
00:34:19,891 --> 00:34:20,725
I'll do better, ma'am.

475
00:34:26,773 --> 00:34:29,192
DIRECTOR JUNG DAE-CHEOL

476
00:34:29,275 --> 00:34:31,402
Young-tak, call me in ten seconds.

477
00:34:34,864 --> 00:34:35,948
Excuse me.

478
00:34:36,032 --> 00:34:38,618
Can I have the key to the room
Director Jung Dae-cheol was in?

479
00:34:38,701 --> 00:34:40,411
May I ask what this is about?

480
00:34:40,495 --> 00:34:42,205
He forgot his handkerchief.

481
00:34:42,288 --> 00:34:44,624
Room keys cannot be received
on behalf of guests.

482
00:34:48,169 --> 00:34:49,670
DIRECTOR JUNG DAE-CHEOL

483
00:34:51,464 --> 00:34:52,340
Yes, Director Jung.

484
00:34:53,508 --> 00:34:54,592
The handkerchief?

485
00:34:56,302 --> 00:34:57,762
I was told you had to come in person.

486
00:34:59,055 --> 00:35:01,390
-Would you like to talk to him?
-Just a second.

487
00:35:03,017 --> 00:35:03,976
Here you go, sir.

488
00:35:04,685 --> 00:35:05,728
-Thank you.
-No problem.

489
00:35:11,192 --> 00:35:13,277
-Hello, sir.
-What was that about?

490
00:35:13,361 --> 00:35:16,531
He asked for the key to the room
Director Jung Dae-cheol was in.

491
00:35:45,726 --> 00:35:47,228
The director left his lens cloth.

492
00:35:50,731 --> 00:35:51,732
Stop.

493
00:35:56,779 --> 00:35:58,739
Director Jung doesn't wear glasses.

494
00:36:01,033 --> 00:36:01,951
Who are you?

495
00:36:08,332 --> 00:36:11,586
Would he be looking for this
if this was an ordinary lens cloth?

496
00:36:13,296 --> 00:36:14,839
He wipes something else with it.

497
00:36:15,381 --> 00:36:16,716
Something precious.

498
00:36:17,216 --> 00:36:19,218
As in what?

499
00:36:20,136 --> 00:36:22,054
What could be so precious?

500
00:36:30,229 --> 00:36:31,898
His golf irons.

501
00:36:38,613 --> 00:36:41,657
Director Jung does indeed
take golf very seriously.

502
00:36:44,577 --> 00:36:45,912
So you know.

503
00:36:45,995 --> 00:36:47,246
You know your clients well.

504
00:36:58,716 --> 00:36:59,550
What now?

505
00:36:59,634 --> 00:37:01,802
See me after you're done today.

506
00:37:02,637 --> 00:37:03,763
We have somewhere to go.

507
00:37:23,824 --> 00:37:25,243
The device has been planted.

508
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:30,915
I've been curious.

509
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:36,837
Which powerhouse could be
pulling the strings behind Doogo?

510
00:37:38,130 --> 00:37:39,757
Is it Doogo you're curious about…

511
00:37:41,342 --> 00:37:42,385
or me?

512
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:50,017
Whatever it is you want to find out,

513
00:37:50,101 --> 00:37:52,687
you won't be able to get it from me.

514
00:37:54,522 --> 00:37:55,898
If you think you can beat me,

515
00:37:57,358 --> 00:37:58,651
give it a shot.

516
00:37:59,694 --> 00:38:03,322
Do you think you can
blow off our wager so easily?

517
00:38:04,949 --> 00:38:07,910
A mere three-year-old company
hit a market value

518
00:38:07,994 --> 00:38:10,371
of nearly two trillion won
without accruing any debt.

519
00:38:10,454 --> 00:38:14,875
Isn't it natural for me
to wonder how all of that was possible?

520
00:38:15,543 --> 00:38:16,961
I'm a businesswoman, after all.

521
00:38:19,422 --> 00:38:21,757
Is your company funded
by a Russian mafia group…

522
00:38:23,718 --> 00:38:24,719
by the name of Pavel?

523
00:38:27,221 --> 00:38:28,806
Does having the mafia behind you

524
00:38:29,765 --> 00:38:31,309
make you feel invincible?

525
00:38:36,897 --> 00:38:39,233
You said you wanted to be a game changer.

526
00:38:40,109 --> 00:38:42,695
You can never become one.

527
00:38:42,778 --> 00:38:43,821
You are a destroyer.

528
00:38:44,822 --> 00:38:46,365
You need to stop right here.

529
00:38:47,283 --> 00:38:48,492
If you don't, you--

530
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:50,411
You are out of line,

531
00:38:51,996 --> 00:38:53,622
Ms. Hwang.

532
00:38:57,335 --> 00:39:00,212
One shouldn't get emotional
when doing business.

533
00:39:01,005 --> 00:39:01,839
You're right.

534
00:39:03,090 --> 00:39:03,924
Was I emotional?

535
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:08,429
I apologize if I offended anyone.

536
00:39:12,058 --> 00:39:13,309
In any case,

537
00:39:15,436 --> 00:39:17,688
I stand by what I said.

538
00:39:52,515 --> 00:39:53,391
Si-o,

539
00:39:53,474 --> 00:39:54,809
are you okay?

540
00:39:58,604 --> 00:39:59,730
Hwang Geum-ju.

541
00:40:02,691 --> 00:40:04,360
She grates on my nerves.

542
00:40:06,404 --> 00:40:08,030
Enough to make me want to kill her.

543
00:40:21,043 --> 00:40:22,128
I'll head out first.

544
00:40:22,211 --> 00:40:23,671
Okay. Shoo.

545
00:40:49,905 --> 00:40:50,781
Where are we going?

546
00:40:52,324 --> 00:40:53,742
You're from Mongolia, right?

547
00:40:54,285 --> 00:40:56,036
I bet you haven't seen the sea before.

548
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:57,997
I'm taking you to see it.

549
00:40:58,080 --> 00:40:59,999
We'll talk while enjoying the view.

550
00:41:02,668 --> 00:41:05,254
How sweet of you. Let's go.

551
00:41:17,933 --> 00:41:18,851
Hey, Mom.

552
00:41:18,934 --> 00:41:19,852
Hey.

553
00:41:19,935 --> 00:41:22,688
I'll be accepting my award
at the police agency later

554
00:41:22,771 --> 00:41:24,148
and need someone to take photos.

555
00:41:24,231 --> 00:41:25,441
You want me to take them?

556
00:41:25,524 --> 00:41:27,109
Jun-hee needs to tend to the café,

557
00:41:27,193 --> 00:41:29,695
so be at the police agency by 3 p.m.

558
00:41:29,778 --> 00:41:30,863
Where are you right now?

559
00:41:32,114 --> 00:41:33,282
At the hospital.

560
00:41:33,365 --> 00:41:35,201
I'm here for Geum-dong's endoscopy.

561
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:40,539
Only a parasite would explain
his listlessness despite eating well.

562
00:41:41,957 --> 00:41:43,501
Mom, I…

563
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:45,669
Fine.

564
00:41:48,923 --> 00:41:50,382
As if I wasn't busy enough.

565
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:53,177
Head to Gold Blue

566
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:54,678
and then to the police agency.

567
00:41:54,762 --> 00:41:55,804
Yes, ma'am.

568
00:42:01,602 --> 00:42:02,603
Mr. Hwang,

569
00:42:02,686 --> 00:42:03,938
you may leave after 30 minutes.

570
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:06,774
Dad?

571
00:42:08,526 --> 00:42:09,443
What the hell?

572
00:42:09,527 --> 00:42:12,154
Dad, I missed you.

573
00:42:13,322 --> 00:42:15,741
I know you've been out of it,

574
00:42:15,824 --> 00:42:17,618
but watch what you're saying.

575
00:42:18,202 --> 00:42:19,286
Dad.

576
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:21,580
I heard about

577
00:42:22,373 --> 00:42:24,708
your soul-searching in Tibet,

578
00:42:25,292 --> 00:42:28,128
-Why you--
-and you coming home tomorrow.

579
00:42:28,212 --> 00:42:29,630
Dad.

580
00:42:32,049 --> 00:42:33,008
But…

581
00:42:33,801 --> 00:42:36,845
Mom has a new man in her life.

582
00:42:38,847 --> 00:42:39,682
Dad,

583
00:42:40,349 --> 00:42:41,767
you've been jilted.

584
00:42:50,234 --> 00:42:51,318
BRAVE CITIZEN AWARD CEREMONY

585
00:42:51,402 --> 00:42:52,278
Thank you.

586
00:42:52,361 --> 00:42:53,654
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

587
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:58,200
No, tell them I can't be there in person.

588
00:42:58,284 --> 00:42:59,535
I'm busy.

589
00:42:59,618 --> 00:43:01,287
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

590
00:43:01,370 --> 00:43:03,539
Thank you so much.

591
00:43:05,082 --> 00:43:07,126
Ms. Gil Joong-gan, congrats!

592
00:43:08,752 --> 00:43:10,796
Look here and smile.

593
00:43:12,089 --> 00:43:14,258
We need to talk.

594
00:43:14,341 --> 00:43:15,217
Sure.

595
00:43:16,176 --> 00:43:19,680
I'm proud of you, Ms. Gil.

596
00:43:21,849 --> 00:43:24,310
Congratulations on being awarded
as a brave citizen.

597
00:43:24,393 --> 00:43:27,354
Hey, I need to confirm something.

598
00:43:27,438 --> 00:43:29,273
Be honest with me.

599
00:43:29,356 --> 00:43:33,569
Otherwise, you and I
will be having a joint funeral.

600
00:43:33,652 --> 00:43:36,405
Why are you acting all melodramatic again?

601
00:43:37,156 --> 00:43:38,824
-What is it?
-Your dad.

602
00:43:40,451 --> 00:43:42,161
Is your dad

603
00:43:42,911 --> 00:43:43,954
coming to Korea?

604
00:43:46,498 --> 00:43:47,625
Answer me.

605
00:43:49,168 --> 00:43:50,210
Yes.

606
00:43:54,256 --> 00:43:55,090
When?

607
00:43:57,092 --> 00:43:58,093
Tomorrow.

608
00:43:59,637 --> 00:44:00,512
During the day.

609
00:44:08,062 --> 00:44:10,022
Mom, what… Hold on.

610
00:44:15,653 --> 00:44:16,987
-Mom, please.
-Oh, no.

611
00:44:19,865 --> 00:44:20,699
No!

612
00:44:20,783 --> 00:44:22,326
He can't come back!

613
00:44:22,409 --> 00:44:23,452
How dare he?

614
00:44:23,535 --> 00:44:24,828
That damn bastard!

615
00:44:24,912 --> 00:44:27,081
Please remember
you just won the Brave Citizen Award!

616
00:44:28,874 --> 00:44:30,000
Mom?

617
00:44:30,084 --> 00:44:31,919
My goodness.

618
00:44:32,002 --> 00:44:33,045
Mom.

619
00:44:34,338 --> 00:44:35,506
Mom?

620
00:44:36,173 --> 00:44:37,633
Mom.

621
00:44:38,425 --> 00:44:39,259
Mom.

622
00:44:40,552 --> 00:44:42,137
I can't believe this.

623
00:44:44,056 --> 00:44:46,392
Mr. Choi, bring the car over.

624
00:44:46,975 --> 00:44:48,519
Ms. Gil just passed out.

625
00:44:49,186 --> 00:44:50,646
Call Dr. Choi. All right.

626
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:53,065
Mom?

627
00:45:13,377 --> 00:45:15,337
I like this place.

628
00:45:17,423 --> 00:45:18,882
What did you want to talk about?

629
00:45:18,966 --> 00:45:20,634
No matter how much I think about it,

630
00:45:21,343 --> 00:45:22,636
I just don't get it.

631
00:45:37,901 --> 00:45:42,114
I need to see for myself
how you managed to cozy up to him.

632
00:45:43,031 --> 00:45:45,909
That man has a heart of stone.

633
00:45:46,869 --> 00:45:49,204
How the hell did you win him over?

634
00:46:34,791 --> 00:46:35,959
Where are you going?

635
00:46:36,043 --> 00:46:37,586
I thought you wanted to talk?

636
00:46:46,094 --> 00:46:47,971
She needs absolute rest.

637
00:47:21,505 --> 00:47:23,757
Nam-in has been acting weird lately.

638
00:47:24,341 --> 00:47:26,885
He rarely leaves his room
and doesn't eat much.

639
00:47:26,969 --> 00:47:28,595
Where is he at the moment?

640
00:47:28,679 --> 00:47:30,472
He went out to see a friend for a change.

641
00:47:30,556 --> 00:47:32,724
I hear he hasn't been at the café lately.

642
00:47:32,808 --> 00:47:34,434
What's going on with him?

643
00:47:34,518 --> 00:47:35,561
Is he seeing someone?

644
00:47:35,644 --> 00:47:37,312
I'll be relieved if he is.

645
00:47:37,396 --> 00:47:38,730
But he's barely eating.

646
00:47:38,814 --> 00:47:40,065
He only lives on water.

647
00:47:40,983 --> 00:47:43,819
Drinking lots of water
is essential for weight loss.

648
00:47:43,902 --> 00:47:44,778
Unbelievable!

649
00:47:45,737 --> 00:47:47,072
Aren't you worried about your child?

650
00:47:47,155 --> 00:47:50,450
Are you trying to start another fight?

651
00:47:50,534 --> 00:47:51,785
Tell me.

652
00:47:51,868 --> 00:47:54,955
Why is Nam-soon working
a delivery job at such a place,

653
00:47:55,038 --> 00:47:56,707
-and Nam-in--
-My dad

654
00:47:57,249 --> 00:47:58,625
will arrive in Korea tomorrow.

655
00:47:59,501 --> 00:48:00,335
What?

656
00:48:04,089 --> 00:48:05,132
Jun-hee.

657
00:48:06,675 --> 00:48:09,511
Will you trust me
no matter what happens to us?

658
00:48:11,930 --> 00:48:12,848
I…

659
00:48:13,432 --> 00:48:15,601
will make sure nothing happens to you,

660
00:48:16,310 --> 00:48:19,479
so please stay by my side. All right?

661
00:48:37,873 --> 00:48:38,707
It's me.

662
00:48:39,291 --> 00:48:40,834
I'll pick your dad up at the airport.

663
00:48:41,460 --> 00:48:42,836
You stay back.

664
00:48:42,919 --> 00:48:44,212
I'll handle this.

665
00:48:44,796 --> 00:48:45,922
Okay.

666
00:48:56,892 --> 00:48:58,644
Yes, that's between those two.

667
00:48:59,603 --> 00:49:01,897
They'll sort things out by themselves.

668
00:49:04,066 --> 00:49:04,900
Welcome home.

669
00:49:05,901 --> 00:49:06,902
Nam-soon!

670
00:49:08,570 --> 00:49:10,697
Mom, how could you
use that tone with Ryu Si-o?

671
00:49:10,781 --> 00:49:13,367
You're one to talk
after butting in on our conversation.

672
00:49:13,450 --> 00:49:16,036
I butted in to stop you
from causing more trouble.

673
00:49:16,119 --> 00:49:18,330
You should've stuck to
talking about investments

674
00:49:18,413 --> 00:49:19,915
and not brought up Pavel.

675
00:49:19,998 --> 00:49:21,416
But that was my moment.

676
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:23,543
When doing business or fighting others,

677
00:49:24,127 --> 00:49:26,546
I attack at an unexpected moment.

678
00:49:26,630 --> 00:49:27,714
A preemptive strike.

679
00:49:27,798 --> 00:49:31,635
Mom, Ryu Si-o is more dangerous
than you think.

680
00:49:31,718 --> 00:49:34,471
He shouldn't be dealt with that way.

681
00:49:34,554 --> 00:49:35,847
Is this you

682
00:49:36,556 --> 00:49:38,809
talking back to your mother?

683
00:49:38,892 --> 00:49:39,726
Yes!

684
00:49:40,227 --> 00:49:42,270
Stop it.

685
00:49:42,354 --> 00:49:45,691
You two are going to
settle this with words, right?

686
00:49:45,774 --> 00:49:48,360
It makes me nervous
since you're both strong.

687
00:49:48,443 --> 00:49:50,654
I may be strong,
but I would never hit her, Dad.

688
00:49:50,737 --> 00:49:52,572
I know that, but what I meant was--

689
00:49:52,656 --> 00:49:54,741
Who knew I'd live to see this day?

690
00:49:54,825 --> 00:49:56,368
My daughter is rebelling against me.

691
00:49:57,953 --> 00:49:59,955
You're holding your ground
and challenging me.

692
00:50:00,455 --> 00:50:01,456
You have no idea

693
00:50:01,957 --> 00:50:04,710
how much I envied my friends
who argued with their daughters.

694
00:50:06,169 --> 00:50:07,671
Anyway, Mom,

695
00:50:07,754 --> 00:50:09,673
don't do that again.

696
00:50:09,756 --> 00:50:10,590
Please.

697
00:50:11,258 --> 00:50:12,217
Sure.

698
00:50:21,226 --> 00:50:22,894
Are you pleased to see me
put down by our daughter?

699
00:50:22,978 --> 00:50:23,812
Yes.

700
00:50:24,604 --> 00:50:26,440
No, of course not.

701
00:51:06,021 --> 00:51:08,607
Is your company funded
by a Russian mafia group

702
00:51:09,316 --> 00:51:10,275
by the name of Pavel?

703
00:51:48,647 --> 00:51:49,731
Ms. Hwang.

704
00:51:50,357 --> 00:51:51,274
I…

705
00:51:51,775 --> 00:51:54,194
was taking some time to relax.

706
00:51:54,277 --> 00:51:55,529
I'd expect no less.

707
00:51:59,950 --> 00:52:00,951
So what…

708
00:52:02,869 --> 00:52:04,204
brings you here today?

709
00:52:05,288 --> 00:52:07,916
You know Ryu Si-o, don't you?

710
00:52:09,292 --> 00:52:10,293
Ryu Si-o?

711
00:52:10,377 --> 00:52:11,503
Who may that be?

712
00:52:33,233 --> 00:52:34,109
Where…

713
00:52:34,192 --> 00:52:35,819
Where did you get this photo?

714
00:52:35,902 --> 00:52:37,320
Tell me the truth.

715
00:52:38,363 --> 00:52:40,615
-You--
-Are you stalking me?

716
00:52:40,699 --> 00:52:41,825
Of course not.

717
00:52:41,908 --> 00:52:43,702
Where did you get this photo?

718
00:52:44,661 --> 00:52:45,787
Hold on, this--

719
00:52:45,871 --> 00:52:47,205
Tell me where you got this.

720
00:52:47,289 --> 00:52:49,124
Why are you getting worked up?

721
00:52:49,207 --> 00:52:50,417
-You're--
-Tell me or get out!

722
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:53,295
-What--
-Leave before I'll call security.

723
00:52:53,378 --> 00:52:55,881
Are you kicking me out again?

724
00:52:55,964 --> 00:52:57,966
-Why are you tearing that?
-Get out!

725
00:52:58,049 --> 00:52:59,551
-Why did you tear--
-Leave already!

726
00:53:00,302 --> 00:53:01,803
What the…

727
00:53:02,470 --> 00:53:03,680
That was mine, you know.

728
00:53:03,763 --> 00:53:05,640
Banish Ms. Hwang
from our premises immediately.

729
00:53:05,724 --> 00:53:06,683
What?

730
00:53:07,517 --> 00:53:09,102
Banish me?

731
00:53:09,728 --> 00:53:12,731
Hold on. You're banishing me?

732
00:53:12,814 --> 00:53:14,900
Hey, you. Mr. Bread.

733
00:53:14,983 --> 00:53:16,443
Answer me, damn it!

734
00:53:16,526 --> 00:53:17,485
Mr. Bread!

735
00:53:18,778 --> 00:53:20,238
Answer me already!

736
00:53:20,322 --> 00:53:21,156
Mr. Bread!

737
00:53:34,085 --> 00:53:35,253
Joong-gan!

738
00:53:36,922 --> 00:53:38,506
Joong-gan, my love!

739
00:53:40,967 --> 00:53:42,677
-You're here.
-Have you been well?

740
00:53:43,386 --> 00:53:45,555
You haven't changed one bit.

741
00:53:45,639 --> 00:53:48,642
I did a lot of meditation in Tibet.

742
00:53:50,310 --> 00:53:52,228
And what conclusion did you reach?

743
00:53:52,312 --> 00:53:56,566
I've decided to be your devoted husband
until the day I die.

744
00:53:58,026 --> 00:54:00,737
So you've accepted
that you will die, right?

745
00:54:00,820 --> 00:54:02,364
-What?
-Then,

746
00:54:02,447 --> 00:54:03,949
we'll start with that.

747
00:54:11,873 --> 00:54:13,249
He went flying!

748
00:54:14,751 --> 00:54:16,795
-Oh, no.
-No way.

749
00:54:16,878 --> 00:54:19,756
I'm only punishing
my irresponsible husband

750
00:54:19,839 --> 00:54:21,383
who bailed on his family ten years ago.

751
00:54:21,466 --> 00:54:22,842
Please mind your own business.

752
00:54:22,926 --> 00:54:24,803
Don't interfere
with someone else's family matters.

753
00:54:24,886 --> 00:54:26,137
Shouldn't we call 911?

754
00:54:26,221 --> 00:54:27,722
I think we need to call an ambulance.

755
00:54:27,806 --> 00:54:29,849
It's fine. I'll push him myself.

756
00:54:30,517 --> 00:54:32,811
-What's going on?
-Goodness.

757
00:54:32,894 --> 00:54:34,062
-Oh, no.
-What's going on?

758
00:54:34,145 --> 00:54:36,439
-Is he dead?
-He did go flying.

759
00:54:52,789 --> 00:54:55,500
Nam-in!

760
00:54:56,126 --> 00:54:57,210
Nam-in.

761
00:54:57,293 --> 00:54:59,963
Nam-in, look at me!

762
00:55:00,588 --> 00:55:02,507
Nam-in!

763
00:55:03,341 --> 00:55:04,175
It's me, your dad!

764
00:55:38,752 --> 00:55:40,462
I need you to kill someone.

765
00:55:49,262 --> 00:55:50,305
You scared me.

766
00:55:51,723 --> 00:55:53,641
Is surprising people your thing?

767
00:55:56,311 --> 00:55:58,229
Ms. Baek, what skin products do you use?

768
00:55:58,730 --> 00:55:59,564
Your skin is flawless.

769
00:56:00,231 --> 00:56:01,858
Oh, please.

770
00:56:02,901 --> 00:56:04,569
But what's this?

771
00:56:04,652 --> 00:56:06,237
CTR? CTG?

772
00:56:06,321 --> 00:56:07,197
Goodness.

773
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:08,823
You shouldn't be reading this.

774
00:56:08,907 --> 00:56:10,784
They're codes for our export products.

775
00:56:12,744 --> 00:56:16,206
Ms. Baek, I'm also a Doogo Woman.

776
00:56:16,748 --> 00:56:18,249
We're family,

777
00:56:18,333 --> 00:56:23,296
and that means we should even know
how many pairs of underwear the other has.

778
00:56:23,379 --> 00:56:26,257
I have to learn the ropes
as fast as possible.

779
00:56:27,175 --> 00:56:28,510
Down to our underwear?

780
00:56:29,260 --> 00:56:30,428
That's a bit excessive.

781
00:56:33,598 --> 00:56:37,894
Is there a certain item
that only Mr. Ryu manages?

782
00:56:38,561 --> 00:56:40,980
Is that the reason for all this secrecy?

783
00:56:41,064 --> 00:56:42,357
Of course.

784
00:56:43,149 --> 00:56:45,151
What does "CT" mean?

785
00:56:45,235 --> 00:56:47,987
The code for all our
export products starts with CT.

786
00:56:48,071 --> 00:56:49,155
I see.

787
00:56:50,865 --> 00:56:55,411
What's the code for the item
handled by Mr. Ryu personally?

788
00:56:58,498 --> 00:57:00,542
-I can't tell you that.
-What's going on here?

789
00:57:01,709 --> 00:57:03,128
Are you done invoicing 4885?

790
00:57:03,211 --> 00:57:04,212
Yes, sir.

791
00:57:04,295 --> 00:57:05,630
They'll be shipped out tomorrow.

792
00:57:06,673 --> 00:57:07,507
Get lost.

793
00:57:08,383 --> 00:57:10,385
The new hire shouldn't be lurking around.

794
00:57:10,468 --> 00:57:12,512
-Leave already!
-Okay, fine!

795
00:57:12,595 --> 00:57:13,888
I'll leave, okay?

796
00:57:13,972 --> 00:57:15,056
There's no need to yell.

797
00:57:15,140 --> 00:57:16,224
Go already!

798
00:57:20,270 --> 00:57:21,521
Is the ice cream that good?

799
00:57:31,990 --> 00:57:33,074
Come to my office.

800
00:57:33,616 --> 00:57:35,869
The person you called is not available.
Please leave a message…

801
00:57:45,211 --> 00:57:46,671
KANG HEE-SIK

802
00:57:56,389 --> 00:57:58,892
The person you called is not available.
Please leave a message…

803
00:58:17,535 --> 00:58:18,536
You called for me?

804
00:58:25,460 --> 00:58:26,669
Can you kill someone?

805
00:58:34,594 --> 00:58:36,554
Surely someone who lived in Mongolia

806
00:58:37,472 --> 00:58:39,599
should be able to handle that much.

807
00:58:40,225 --> 00:58:41,601
What are you getting at?

808
00:58:43,144 --> 00:58:44,187
Hwang Geum-ju.

809
00:58:45,897 --> 00:58:48,691
Can you kill her for my sake?

810
00:58:55,281 --> 00:58:56,324
No need to be so startled.

811
00:58:56,991 --> 00:58:58,034
Don't worry.

812
00:58:59,786 --> 00:59:00,870
She's already dead.

813
01:00:00,054 --> 01:00:02,432
STRONG GIRL NAM-SOON

814
01:00:02,515 --> 01:00:05,351
Ms. Hwang.
You should've been more careful.

815
01:00:05,435 --> 01:00:08,855
Just because you want to kill someone
doesn't mean you should.

816
01:00:08,938 --> 01:00:10,982
That woman gets on my nerves.

817
01:00:11,065 --> 01:00:12,483
How dare you go after my mom?

818
01:00:12,567 --> 01:00:15,069
I will thoroughly crush you to bits.

819
01:00:15,153 --> 01:00:17,196
Joong-gan, let me take care of everything.

820
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:18,823
I cannot give up on you.

821
01:00:18,906 --> 01:00:21,034
This is Nam-in's weight-loss pill.
Something's off about it.

822
01:00:21,117 --> 01:00:23,620
Can you analyze what it's made of?

823
01:00:23,703 --> 01:00:25,830
Isn't that a global shipment?

824
01:00:25,913 --> 01:00:27,624
Why do you need to know that?

825
01:00:27,707 --> 01:00:30,376
CTA4885 will be shipped out tomorrow.

826
01:00:30,460 --> 01:00:31,878
You'll cover Agent Gang's escape route.

827
01:00:31,961 --> 01:00:33,254
I'll take the truck.

828
01:00:33,338 --> 01:00:34,589
Babe, can you help me?

829
01:00:34,672 --> 01:00:37,884
What happened on the way
from the warehouse to the port?

830
01:00:37,967 --> 01:00:39,302
An item went missing.

831
01:00:39,385 --> 01:00:41,095
Remember how the team leader
was helping the Busan DIU out?

832
01:00:41,179 --> 01:00:42,221
He never got there.

833
01:00:42,305 --> 01:00:43,723
I left him messages,
but he hasn't called back.

834
01:00:43,806 --> 01:00:46,643
It was as if he knew
that Nam-soon was Tsetseg.
