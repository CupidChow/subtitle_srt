1
00:00:42,667 --> 00:00:45,962
STRONG GIRL NAM-SOON

2
00:01:00,769 --> 00:01:01,770
Gang Nam-soon!

3
00:01:21,039 --> 00:01:22,707
-What was that?
-What's going on?

4
00:01:22,791 --> 00:01:24,542
Get back to work, people!

5
00:01:24,626 --> 00:01:25,668
Get back to work!

6
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:27,295
Get moving!

7
00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:32,592
Did you…

8
00:01:33,384 --> 00:01:35,678
hate me enough to want to kill me?

9
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:38,807
If you hadn't shown up,

10
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:41,351
I would've lived happily ever after.

11
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:43,353
Turn yourself in

12
00:01:43,978 --> 00:01:45,355
or I'll arrest you myself.

13
00:01:46,481 --> 00:01:47,315
I'm…

14
00:01:48,566 --> 00:01:49,567
a cop.

15
00:01:51,277 --> 00:01:53,071
Nam-soon wanted to forgive you,

16
00:01:53,905 --> 00:01:55,323
but I can't.

17
00:01:55,406 --> 00:01:57,283
How dare you try to stab her?

18
00:01:59,285 --> 00:02:01,496
I think I broke a bone.

19
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:12,132
EPISODE 7
MOONBOW

20
00:02:55,341 --> 00:02:56,843
I wanted to thank you

21
00:02:56,926 --> 00:02:58,219
for meeting me

22
00:02:59,095 --> 00:03:01,139
despite your busy schedule.

23
00:03:01,222 --> 00:03:02,724
Your invitation

24
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:05,727
was more than welcome.

25
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:06,686
I've…

26
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,147
been hoping to meet you in private.

27
00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:13,610
Why don't we sit down
and continue our conversation?

28
00:04:03,785 --> 00:04:05,036
What will it be?

29
00:04:05,119 --> 00:04:06,871
Do you know how to play blind man's bluff?

30
00:04:06,955 --> 00:04:07,789
Of course.

31
00:04:07,872 --> 00:04:08,998
Shall we begin?

32
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:28,101
How about this?

33
00:04:28,184 --> 00:04:32,438
The winner gets to make an offer
the loser can't refuse.

34
00:04:32,522 --> 00:04:33,731
What do you say?

35
00:04:34,524 --> 00:04:36,234
Are you scared?

36
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:40,822
Of course not.

37
00:04:41,823 --> 00:04:42,949
I accept your terms.

38
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:54,085
I call and raise.

39
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:00,675
All-in.

40
00:05:02,343 --> 00:05:03,886
Will you call the bet?

41
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:06,973
No.

42
00:05:07,682 --> 00:05:08,683
I'll fold.

43
00:05:20,069 --> 00:05:21,863
I hope you're aware of the rule

44
00:05:21,946 --> 00:05:24,365
that when one folds
while holding the highest card of ten,

45
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:27,535
one must hand over a penalty of ten chips
to the other player.

46
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,878
What would you like from me?

47
00:05:38,421 --> 00:05:39,589
Let's hear it.

48
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:42,508
Doogo has been on the rise lately.

49
00:05:43,217 --> 00:05:46,179
What's the secret to your success?

50
00:05:46,846 --> 00:05:49,432
-Raising profits by--
-Cut the generic crap.

51
00:05:50,391 --> 00:05:55,104
I want to know the real secret.

52
00:05:57,940 --> 00:05:59,609
A game changer.

53
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:01,527
"A game changer"?

54
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:05,615
The power to change the world
and the capitalist market.

55
00:06:08,326 --> 00:06:11,329
My goal is to have such power.

56
00:06:11,412 --> 00:06:12,622
And?

57
00:06:12,705 --> 00:06:16,334
What do you wish
to ultimately achieve with that power?

58
00:06:16,417 --> 00:06:18,127
The weak fall prey to the strong.

59
00:06:18,753 --> 00:06:21,589
Without power,
you're discarded and trampled on.

60
00:06:23,174 --> 00:06:26,094
I want to be on top of the food chain.

61
00:06:26,177 --> 00:06:27,804
Are you confident in your ability

62
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:30,431
to be generous when at the top?

63
00:06:31,015 --> 00:06:34,644
I believe that those with power
should protect the weak.

64
00:06:35,728 --> 00:06:38,189
My goal is to spend my wealth

65
00:06:38,272 --> 00:06:41,776
on shaping the world
into a better place for everyone.

66
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:48,282
That being said,

67
00:06:48,366 --> 00:06:50,368
I'd like to invest in Doogo.

68
00:06:50,451 --> 00:06:52,703
Just how much cash do you have?

69
00:06:52,787 --> 00:06:53,955
How much

70
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:55,957
do you need?

71
00:06:57,625 --> 00:07:00,044
Your success seems to have
made you flippant.

72
00:07:00,128 --> 00:07:01,546
As if.

73
00:07:01,629 --> 00:07:03,506
Did you even look up Doogo's worth

74
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:05,424
before making…

75
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:08,094
-such an audacious offer?
-Of course.

76
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:10,680
1.62 trillion won.

77
00:07:10,763 --> 00:07:13,182
For it to turn into a global enterprise,

78
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:14,142
the amount

79
00:07:14,892 --> 00:07:17,395
seems hardly enough.

80
00:07:20,356 --> 00:07:22,108
I see you have guts.

81
00:07:22,191 --> 00:07:24,527
Or maybe you're just that loaded.

82
00:07:25,403 --> 00:07:27,238
How exactly did you come into the money?

83
00:07:27,321 --> 00:07:29,031
Did you perhaps

84
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:31,534
participate in shady business?

85
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:32,660
As if.

86
00:07:33,327 --> 00:07:36,497
Never did I evade tax
nor participate in shady business

87
00:07:36,581 --> 00:07:40,251
throughout my entire business career.

88
00:07:41,002 --> 00:07:43,671
All I did was work like crazy.

89
00:07:47,925 --> 00:07:50,720
This is a list of all my assets.

90
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:55,892
It's information
that the FSS and the NTS have,

91
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:58,102
so it's no big secret.

92
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:04,192
Tell me what you want

93
00:08:05,943 --> 00:08:07,695
in a straightforward manner.

94
00:08:08,446 --> 00:08:11,115
I want to know

95
00:08:11,616 --> 00:08:13,993
who truly bankrolls Doogo.

96
00:08:14,702 --> 00:08:17,205
Not the shareholders on the list,

97
00:08:17,288 --> 00:08:19,665
but the one who bankrolls the company.

98
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:21,584
The true financier of Doogo?

99
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:24,879
Why do you want to know?

100
00:08:24,962 --> 00:08:28,799
I have a feeling they'll reek of foul play

101
00:08:29,884 --> 00:08:31,427
and would rather offer my money instead.

102
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:35,139
I'd rather be the one
bankrolling Doogo instead.

103
00:08:35,223 --> 00:08:38,226
That's my offer.

104
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:41,979
Anyway, I'll be off.

105
00:09:29,318 --> 00:09:30,945
Is it right for me to be there?

106
00:09:31,028 --> 00:09:32,405
I look so awkward.

107
00:09:32,488 --> 00:09:34,282
I'm not family, nor am I a total stranger.

108
00:09:34,365 --> 00:09:36,117
I'm somewhere in between.

109
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:38,995
It's Nam-in, isn't it?

110
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:41,372
How did you know?

111
00:09:41,455 --> 00:09:43,249
I could feel the weight of your hands.

112
00:09:43,332 --> 00:09:46,794
But most importantly,
your hands always smell of sandwiches.

113
00:09:49,005 --> 00:09:51,132
Dad, I made a declaration of independence.

114
00:09:51,215 --> 00:09:52,300
You made a what?

115
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:54,427
I claimed my independence from the tyrant!

116
00:09:55,219 --> 00:09:56,596
As if that's even possible.

117
00:09:56,679 --> 00:09:59,098
The fact that I can almost see
your dream being crushed

118
00:09:59,682 --> 00:10:01,475
must be because I'm used to her ways.

119
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:04,687
You edited me to look slimmer.

120
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:06,397
Yes, I cut you down in half.

121
00:10:07,064 --> 00:10:09,609
But the tyrant
wouldn't like seeing the photo here.

122
00:10:09,692 --> 00:10:10,651
Why not?

123
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:13,487
Mom said Nam-soon's identity was a secret.

124
00:10:13,571 --> 00:10:15,031
-Why?
-Who knows?

125
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:16,866
Who knows what's going on in her mind?

126
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:17,908
BONG PHOTO GALLERY

127
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:23,539
Hand me your phone.

128
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:26,667
If your phone has been hacked,

129
00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:29,337
we need to start by finding
the malware in it.

130
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:33,466
Here it is.

131
00:10:34,008 --> 00:10:37,637
If we reverse-engineer it,
it should get us the hacker's IP address,

132
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:40,348
but we likely won't get results
since it's usually routed overseas.

133
00:10:44,435 --> 00:10:45,478
That was a bust.

134
00:10:45,561 --> 00:10:47,480
If the files they took hadn't been erased,

135
00:10:47,563 --> 00:10:48,773
I could backtrack those.

136
00:10:48,856 --> 00:10:50,566
But the hackers know that,

137
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:52,652
so they would've erased them instantly.

138
00:10:52,735 --> 00:10:54,070
Then what do we do?

139
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:55,112
We take another route.

140
00:10:55,196 --> 00:10:56,572
Where?

141
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:58,115
Directly to their computer.

142
00:11:02,536 --> 00:11:05,331
No, Dad…

143
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:07,041
I found him.

144
00:11:07,124 --> 00:11:09,627
Hey, what's this guy's address?

145
00:11:10,419 --> 00:11:12,004
Seoul…

146
00:11:13,798 --> 00:11:15,675
You're not trying
to get me arrested, are you?

147
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:18,010
This is illegal.

148
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:21,263
Come on, Mom.

149
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:24,225
Wait…

150
00:11:24,308 --> 00:11:26,018
Ms. Gil, wait for me.

151
00:11:26,102 --> 00:11:28,479
She's truly as fast as lightning.

152
00:11:28,562 --> 00:11:30,231
Don't forget your phone.

153
00:11:30,314 --> 00:11:31,899
Right. Thanks.

154
00:11:35,611 --> 00:11:37,154
That took a lot out of me.

155
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:39,281
I need to lie down.

156
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:40,324
I'm exhausted.

157
00:11:44,662 --> 00:11:46,080
There's no one here.

158
00:11:46,163 --> 00:11:47,289
Let's go somewhere else.

159
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:50,960
Am I invisible or something?

160
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:53,337
Anyway, where on earth did Nam-in go?

161
00:11:53,421 --> 00:11:55,965
Am I really supposed
to man the café by myself?

162
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:06,058
Hello?

163
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:07,852
It's me, Pollock.

164
00:12:07,935 --> 00:12:09,395
What are you up to?

165
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:18,112
Sir.

166
00:12:19,822 --> 00:12:21,031
It's me, Young-tak.

167
00:12:21,115 --> 00:12:22,032
I…

168
00:12:24,076 --> 00:12:25,119
didn't have any water.

169
00:12:25,911 --> 00:12:27,121
I overcame the urge.

170
00:12:27,204 --> 00:12:28,330
Good for you, sir.

171
00:12:29,623 --> 00:12:32,084
Hang in there a while longer.

172
00:12:34,753 --> 00:12:35,588
Thanks.

173
00:12:36,338 --> 00:12:37,882
Where's Hee-sik?

174
00:12:37,965 --> 00:12:39,925
He went to Doogo.

175
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:42,428
Why did he go there
when I said that place was a bust?

176
00:12:42,511 --> 00:12:45,014
I think he's onto something.
Let's trust him on this.

177
00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:47,725
Let's go.

178
00:12:47,808 --> 00:12:49,435
What? Go where?

179
00:12:49,518 --> 00:12:50,978
I can't stay here forever.

180
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:53,772
I told you.

181
00:12:53,856 --> 00:12:55,483
People don't change that easily.

182
00:12:55,566 --> 00:12:56,567
Could she truly

183
00:12:57,276 --> 00:12:59,069
have wanted me dead?

184
00:12:59,153 --> 00:13:00,654
You're being too nice.

185
00:13:00,738 --> 00:13:03,616
Just be nice to me and not to anyone else.

186
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:10,039
She'll be detained for attempted murder
once she's discharged from the hospital.

187
00:13:14,877 --> 00:13:17,087
By the way,
is your team leader doing better?

188
00:13:24,386 --> 00:13:25,221
It's him.

189
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:29,058
Hello, sir. Are you feeling better?

190
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:30,559
These weren't it.

191
00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:33,812
None of them reacted to water either?

192
00:13:33,896 --> 00:13:34,897
No.

193
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:36,398
Are you sure about this tip?

194
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:37,858
I'll see you at the precinct.

195
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:40,986
None tested positive for drugs?

196
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:42,071
No.

197
00:13:47,409 --> 00:13:49,578
Why don't we just order the items

198
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:52,039
instead of trying to steal them?

199
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:54,416
We could buy everything there.

200
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:58,170
They would never be sold
to ordinary customers.

201
00:14:01,382 --> 00:14:05,928
Then shouldn't we look through
the CEO's computer?

202
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:06,971
Think about it.

203
00:14:07,054 --> 00:14:08,597
If there are drugs at Doogo,

204
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:12,393
a client list
must be stored on his computer.

205
00:14:12,476 --> 00:14:15,854
Shouldn't finding that be our priority?

206
00:14:17,815 --> 00:14:19,191
We should go about it differently.

207
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:22,528
All right.

208
00:14:22,611 --> 00:14:24,530
Let's get the client list first.

209
00:14:24,613 --> 00:14:27,074
If we can track down the clients,

210
00:14:27,157 --> 00:14:28,993
that will be our smoking gun.

211
00:14:29,076 --> 00:14:30,369
Right.

212
00:14:31,787 --> 00:14:33,664
But how do I gain access to his office?

213
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:39,378
Hold on.

214
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:46,802
How's your injury?

215
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:48,721
Are you okay with working again so soon?

216
00:14:48,804 --> 00:14:49,763
Of course.

217
00:14:49,847 --> 00:14:52,224
I'm fine even after handling
three shifts in a row.

218
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:54,393
Hold on.

219
00:14:54,476 --> 00:14:56,061
You haven't even slept?

220
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:57,813
I'm not tired at all.

221
00:14:57,897 --> 00:14:59,773
I take a special kind of energy drink.

222
00:15:00,482 --> 00:15:03,110
An energy drink? What's that?

223
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:10,993
I told you only to be nice to me.

224
00:15:11,076 --> 00:15:14,580
Why do youngsters in Korea
work their butts off?

225
00:15:14,663 --> 00:15:15,748
They don't even rest.

226
00:15:15,831 --> 00:15:17,166
The same goes for me.

227
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:20,002
-I'm starting the car.
-Okay.

228
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,307
BONGO DRUM

229
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:34,558
It's me.

230
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:37,102
-Are you busy tomorrow?
-I am.

231
00:15:37,186 --> 00:15:38,437
Cancel everything.

232
00:15:39,021 --> 00:15:41,482
There will be a family party
at the Superior Room.

233
00:15:42,316 --> 00:15:43,734
INCOMING CALL

234
00:15:45,152 --> 00:15:45,986
Hello?

235
00:15:47,363 --> 00:15:48,572
Yes, hello.

236
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:52,534
Sure. Let's meet.

237
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:00,876
It's always her way or the highway.

238
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,002
There's a party tomorrow.

239
00:16:02,086 --> 00:16:04,421
I know. It's your birthday.

240
00:16:06,006 --> 00:16:07,716
The tyrant must've planned
a party for you.

241
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:08,801
As if.

242
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:11,470
She's never done that for me before.

243
00:16:18,435 --> 00:16:20,062
Why aren't you eating?

244
00:16:20,604 --> 00:16:22,147
You've never stopped with one box before.

245
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:24,858
I took this weight-loss pill,

246
00:16:24,942 --> 00:16:26,318
and I think it's working.

247
00:16:27,236 --> 00:16:29,446
-I strangely don't have an appetite.
-Really?

248
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:30,906
What exactly is this pill?

249
00:16:34,785 --> 00:16:36,704
CASE REPORT

250
00:17:34,344 --> 00:17:36,972
I know the café was opened
to write off business expenses,

251
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:38,474
but business is too slow.

252
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:41,393
Its purpose was to teach Nam-in
how to run a business,

253
00:17:41,477 --> 00:17:43,437
so its revenue is irrelevant.

254
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,813
Ms. Jung,

255
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:45,773
why do you live?

256
00:17:45,856 --> 00:17:49,359
I'm giving life a chance
just in case something comes up.

257
00:17:49,443 --> 00:17:51,111
Anyway, I'll get going.

258
00:17:51,195 --> 00:17:52,905
I have a golf lesson.

259
00:17:52,988 --> 00:17:54,031
Ms. Jung.

260
00:17:57,701 --> 00:17:59,953
What do you think about me?

261
00:18:00,537 --> 00:18:01,955
Why would you even ask me that?

262
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,043
There's no one here.

263
00:18:06,126 --> 00:18:08,337
Hearing the same thing twice
sure is annoying.

264
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:09,463
Am I invisible to you?

265
00:18:10,214 --> 00:18:11,840
Here's some leftover fried chicken.

266
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:14,468
Leftovers?

267
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:18,972
Mom told me to
talk you out of moving in with your dad,

268
00:18:19,056 --> 00:18:20,516
but I think otherwise.

269
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:21,642
I…

270
00:18:21,725 --> 00:18:22,851
I believe

271
00:18:23,685 --> 00:18:25,729
you'd be better off with him
than with your mom.

272
00:18:25,813 --> 00:18:28,398
You guys have the same personality type
and are a matching set.

273
00:18:28,482 --> 00:18:31,860
-People should be in sets.
-Where did Grandma and Mr. Seo go?

274
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:33,654
They're also a set of their own.

275
00:18:34,321 --> 00:18:35,823
Like dried pollock and mayonnaise,

276
00:18:35,906 --> 00:18:38,951
Batman and Robin, and oxes and fields.

277
00:18:39,576 --> 00:18:41,912
She did say she'd bag him or something.

278
00:18:42,454 --> 00:18:43,705
I can't believe Grandma.

279
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:45,749
-Damn it.
-Anyway, Ms. Jung…

280
00:18:51,547 --> 00:18:52,923
I'm exhausted.

281
00:18:59,596 --> 00:19:00,514
UNIT 511

282
00:19:00,597 --> 00:19:01,682
DIGITAL WORK
UNIT 511

283
00:19:04,351 --> 00:19:06,395
Joong-gan…

284
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:17,906
What the hell?

285
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:19,950
Who the hell are you, lady?

286
00:19:31,962 --> 00:19:33,172
You, come here.

287
00:19:36,967 --> 00:19:39,428
Would you rather take the ambulance
with a broken back,

288
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:40,929
or walk out on your own?

289
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:53,609
Strike!

290
00:19:56,528 --> 00:19:58,614
-Could you get the door, Jun-hee?
-Sure.

291
00:20:07,998 --> 00:20:09,249
Jun-hee.

292
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,418
I bet that startled you.

293
00:20:11,501 --> 00:20:12,753
I'll explain everything,

294
00:20:12,836 --> 00:20:14,087
so hop in.

295
00:20:14,171 --> 00:20:15,672
Come on.

296
00:20:32,856 --> 00:20:33,982
Here you go.

297
00:20:34,608 --> 00:20:36,485
These are the deepfake scammers.

298
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:38,153
-Lock them up.
-Yes, ma'am.

299
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:40,072
You said it would take you six months.

300
00:20:40,155 --> 00:20:43,033
But I managed to catch them straight away.

301
00:20:43,116 --> 00:20:45,035
They're flight risks,
so have them detained.

302
00:20:45,118 --> 00:20:46,453
Understood, ma'am.

303
00:20:46,536 --> 00:20:48,497
Hey, you two.

304
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:51,625
Get up. You need to be questioned.

305
00:20:53,377 --> 00:20:58,507
You'd better return the 20 million won
you scammed out of him quickly

306
00:20:59,132 --> 00:21:01,009
or your backbones

307
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:06,807
will be crushed into pieces
small enough to make bone soup with.

308
00:21:08,225 --> 00:21:09,059
Do you hear me?

309
00:21:09,142 --> 00:21:10,852
-Yes, ma'am.
-Yes, ma'am.

310
00:21:13,146 --> 00:21:14,564
-Excuse me.
-Yes, ma'am?

311
00:21:14,648 --> 00:21:16,900
If you don't investigate
this case properly,

312
00:21:16,984 --> 00:21:19,611
you'll meet the same fate.

313
00:21:19,695 --> 00:21:22,322
You know the phrase,
"Take the law into one's own hands"?

314
00:21:22,406 --> 00:21:24,074
Don't make me show you an example, okay?

315
00:21:24,157 --> 00:21:25,492
You have my word.

316
00:21:27,869 --> 00:21:29,204
Let's go, Jun-hee.

317
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:33,542
All the talk about backbones
has me craving pork backbone stew.

318
00:21:34,876 --> 00:21:35,794
All right.

319
00:21:39,214 --> 00:21:40,257
Have a good day, ma'am!

320
00:21:46,013 --> 00:21:47,306
Excuse me, ma'am?

321
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:52,602
The victim of the overturned car incident…

322
00:21:52,686 --> 00:21:55,147
I meant, the offender of that incident.

323
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:56,189
He's dead, ma'am.

324
00:21:56,273 --> 00:21:58,483
What? How?

325
00:21:58,567 --> 00:22:00,027
He died of a heart attack,

326
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:02,279
but the DIU at our headquarters
took over his case.

327
00:22:02,362 --> 00:22:03,322
Drugs?

328
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:04,781
Hey!

329
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:10,162
I thought it was weird
that he parked in front of my car

330
00:22:10,871 --> 00:22:13,623
when there were plenty of spaces to park.

331
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:16,960
I feel bad for the young man.

332
00:22:17,044 --> 00:22:19,212
The Drug Investigation Unit
may call you in

333
00:22:19,296 --> 00:22:21,131
for questioning as a person of interest.

334
00:22:21,214 --> 00:22:22,758
We ask for your cooperation.

335
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:23,884
No problem.

336
00:22:24,551 --> 00:22:27,888
Anyway, keep checking with him
so he closes the case quickly.

337
00:22:28,472 --> 00:22:29,723
I mean,

338
00:22:31,058 --> 00:22:33,435
I can't beat up a detective.

339
00:22:33,518 --> 00:22:35,103
Of course not, ma'am.

340
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:38,190
We'll head up and have a word with him.

341
00:22:38,273 --> 00:22:39,232
Good.

342
00:22:39,733 --> 00:22:42,027
I'll trust your word on this.

343
00:22:45,322 --> 00:22:46,573
Take care, ma'am.

344
00:22:49,576 --> 00:22:51,119
-Here.
-Thanks.

345
00:23:00,545 --> 00:23:01,421
That hits the spot.

346
00:23:02,756 --> 00:23:03,924
Ms. Gil.

347
00:23:04,841 --> 00:23:06,843
How are you so strong?

348
00:23:06,927 --> 00:23:08,011
Oh, that.

349
00:23:09,471 --> 00:23:10,847
You see,

350
00:23:11,681 --> 00:23:15,310
my family has a special gene
that's maternally inherited.

351
00:23:18,647 --> 00:23:19,481
BRATTY DAUGHTER

352
00:23:19,564 --> 00:23:22,359
A family party will be held this Saturday.

353
00:23:23,819 --> 00:23:25,153
Tomorrow, my bratty daughter…

354
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,491
I mean, my daughter
is hosting a party at six.

355
00:23:29,574 --> 00:23:31,076
Please come with me.

356
00:23:31,159 --> 00:23:34,996
Everything will be explained there.

357
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:36,123
Before that,

358
00:23:37,165 --> 00:23:38,125
could I ask…

359
00:23:38,959 --> 00:23:39,960
Well,

360
00:23:40,043 --> 00:23:41,837
I know this is out of line,

361
00:23:43,296 --> 00:23:44,923
but are you transgender?

362
00:23:45,966 --> 00:23:47,175
Were you a man?

363
00:23:48,718 --> 00:23:50,303
You and your humor.

364
00:23:50,387 --> 00:23:51,847
It wasn't funny though.

365
00:23:53,682 --> 00:23:56,393
Didn't I just say my daughter texted?

366
00:23:56,476 --> 00:23:58,436
I gave birth to her myself.

367
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:01,398
My mom was also just as strong as I was.

368
00:24:01,481 --> 00:24:03,316
Why do you think my name
means "middle of the street"?

369
00:24:03,942 --> 00:24:07,487
It's because my mom gave birth to me
in the middle of the street.

370
00:24:07,571 --> 00:24:09,239
Hence, "Gil Joong-gan."

371
00:24:09,322 --> 00:24:10,532
It runs in the family.

372
00:24:10,615 --> 00:24:12,200
You're so silly.

373
00:24:14,452 --> 00:24:15,620
Not to mention,

374
00:24:16,413 --> 00:24:17,873
you saw everything
for yourself that night.

375
00:24:18,498 --> 00:24:19,708
Unbelievable.

376
00:24:21,376 --> 00:24:22,586
How embarrassing.

377
00:24:25,881 --> 00:24:26,923
Your seat belt.

378
00:24:28,425 --> 00:24:29,467
Oh, right.

379
00:24:36,933 --> 00:24:38,560
The bait has been set.

380
00:24:39,144 --> 00:24:41,146
He won't bite instantly,

381
00:24:41,813 --> 00:24:44,649
but it would've been enough
to provoke him.

382
00:24:45,775 --> 00:24:47,944
Before founding Doogo,

383
00:24:48,028 --> 00:24:49,779
Ryu Si-o was in Russia.

384
00:24:49,863 --> 00:24:51,531
Opulentia is trying to figure out

385
00:24:52,282 --> 00:24:53,992
the business he conducted.

386
00:25:03,543 --> 00:25:05,837
What's the name
of this Russian mafia group?

387
00:25:08,215 --> 00:25:09,257
Here, sir.

388
00:25:15,472 --> 00:25:18,642
I wonder why she did such a thing.

389
00:25:18,725 --> 00:25:22,812
What happened today may provide an answer.

390
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:27,525
This woman fought with Tsetseg.

391
00:25:28,026 --> 00:25:30,111
-Why?
-My guess is that

392
00:25:30,195 --> 00:25:32,614
they were in on the theft together.

393
00:25:32,697 --> 00:25:35,283
An Eun-ji wanted out for some reason,

394
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:37,244
so Tsetseg sent her flying.

395
00:25:38,119 --> 00:25:40,747
Also, An Eun-ji lied about who she was.

396
00:25:41,331 --> 00:25:43,458
Her real name is Lee Myung-hee.

397
00:25:45,168 --> 00:25:46,503
This is our last stop, right?

398
00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:48,964
I'm starting to get the hang of things.

399
00:25:51,132 --> 00:25:53,843
I'm seeing my dad tonight.

400
00:25:53,927 --> 00:25:55,262
Go ahead. No one's stopping you.

401
00:25:56,721 --> 00:25:59,557
I won't take long, so wait for me here.

402
00:25:59,641 --> 00:26:01,434
No, I'm leaving if you take too long.

403
00:26:03,103 --> 00:26:04,521
Then I'll hit you.

404
00:26:04,604 --> 00:26:06,523
What did I say about being cheeky?

405
00:26:06,606 --> 00:26:08,441
I'm going to be cheeky.

406
00:26:08,525 --> 00:26:09,693
"Don't be cheeky."

407
00:26:14,739 --> 00:26:16,533
Do you have feelings for my daughter?

408
00:26:16,616 --> 00:26:17,993
No, I don't.

409
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:21,621
Maybe I do.

410
00:26:32,632 --> 00:26:34,217
LIST OF HWANG GEUM-JU'S ASSETS

411
00:26:34,884 --> 00:26:36,052
Hwang Geum-ju.

412
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:38,596
She's no joke.

413
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:41,516
They say every tycoon in Korea
has borrowed money from her.

414
00:26:42,892 --> 00:26:45,770
I want more information on her.

415
00:26:45,854 --> 00:26:47,147
Yes, sir.

416
00:26:53,528 --> 00:26:54,571
I almost forgot.

417
00:26:56,573 --> 00:26:57,615
Here.

418
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:00,452
Please look into him for me.

419
00:27:00,535 --> 00:27:01,953
I think he's a scammer,

420
00:27:02,495 --> 00:27:05,165
and all the ladies in Gangnam
have fallen for his tricks.

421
00:27:05,248 --> 00:27:07,625
I assume he's quite the gigolo?

422
00:27:07,709 --> 00:27:09,586
He operates on a larger scale than that.

423
00:27:10,837 --> 00:27:13,757
I'd say he's a guy
ready to wreak some havoc.

424
00:27:21,056 --> 00:27:22,724
-Hello?
-112,

425
00:27:22,807 --> 00:27:25,101
348, and 289.

426
00:27:25,185 --> 00:27:26,227
Enough with that.

427
00:27:28,021 --> 00:27:30,565
I'm not in the mood
for number games today, Mr. Nam.

428
00:27:31,191 --> 00:27:32,317
Just a second.

429
00:27:34,027 --> 00:27:36,654
You wanted to know
where my boss was, didn't you?

430
00:27:37,364 --> 00:27:39,532
Those are the GPS coordinates.

431
00:27:40,283 --> 00:27:42,994
112, 348, 289.

432
00:27:43,078 --> 00:27:45,038
I want words, not numbers.

433
00:27:45,121 --> 00:27:46,998
Round Jiji, the café in Cheongdam.

434
00:27:52,712 --> 00:27:56,132
Germany's Sheita Airlines
has 100 million shares issued,

435
00:27:56,216 --> 00:27:59,386
and their prices have plummeted
to ten euros per share,

436
00:27:59,469 --> 00:28:01,471
which makes the market cap
a billion dollars.

437
00:28:01,554 --> 00:28:04,641
Theoretically, you can buy the company
with a billion dollars.

438
00:28:04,724 --> 00:28:07,060
But upon further research,

439
00:28:07,143 --> 00:28:10,605
I found out that you can earn more than
two billion just by selling their planes.

440
00:28:10,688 --> 00:28:13,858
Its storage, real estate,
and savings are worth another billion.

441
00:28:13,942 --> 00:28:14,901
So technically,

442
00:28:16,653 --> 00:28:18,029
the company is worth
three billion dollars.

443
00:28:25,328 --> 00:28:28,748
The company's value only plummeted
due to the pandemic,

444
00:28:28,832 --> 00:28:30,708
but we still need planes.

445
00:28:30,792 --> 00:28:32,794
Not to transport passengers…

446
00:28:35,255 --> 00:28:37,549
but to transport cargo.

447
00:28:37,632 --> 00:28:38,591
Bread.

448
00:28:40,969 --> 00:28:44,431
The fund you suggested
invests in that company, right?

449
00:28:44,514 --> 00:28:46,474
Just like the leaves falling
in Mount Sobaek on a fall day,

450
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:49,018
the sound of money falling into your lap

451
00:28:49,102 --> 00:28:51,104
will soon be music to your ears.

452
00:28:52,814 --> 00:28:55,483
Raining money.

453
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:58,486
Raining money.

454
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:01,030
I can almost hear it.

455
00:29:05,368 --> 00:29:06,995
Don't let…

456
00:29:09,289 --> 00:29:10,331
anyone else know.

457
00:29:10,999 --> 00:29:11,833
Raining…

458
00:29:12,834 --> 00:29:14,335
money.

459
00:29:15,378 --> 00:29:16,671
-Raining money.
-Raining money.

460
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:18,631
-Raining money.
-Raining money.

461
00:29:18,715 --> 00:29:19,883
-Raining money.
-Money.

462
00:29:19,966 --> 00:29:21,342
"Raining money"?

463
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:26,347
-That damn scammer.
-Trust me, ma'am.

464
00:29:26,431 --> 00:29:29,058
He's only going after the lonely ones.

465
00:29:39,402 --> 00:29:40,570
Ms. Hwang?

466
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:43,239
Goodness, Ms. Gong.

467
00:29:43,323 --> 00:29:46,117
You've been skipping
our golf rounds recently.

468
00:29:46,201 --> 00:29:47,952
Didn't think I'd find you here.

469
00:29:48,578 --> 00:29:50,371
We should play golf sometime, Ms. Gong.

470
00:29:52,207 --> 00:29:54,000
Mr. Bread, you're having bread.

471
00:29:54,083 --> 00:29:56,878
Hey, that rhymed!

472
00:30:03,384 --> 00:30:04,886
This must be about an investment.

473
00:30:04,969 --> 00:30:07,222
Can you let me in on the information too?

474
00:30:11,476 --> 00:30:12,519
I'm afraid I'm quite busy.

475
00:30:13,353 --> 00:30:14,979
I'll be in touch.

476
00:30:15,063 --> 00:30:18,274
Bread, wait.

477
00:30:18,358 --> 00:30:20,568
Bread!

478
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:24,614
Cocky much?

479
00:30:25,573 --> 00:30:26,741
Tipping in dollars?

480
00:30:27,742 --> 00:30:29,410
Unload everything here.

481
00:30:31,287 --> 00:30:33,081
Hey, Tsetseg.

482
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,375
The CEO asked for you.

483
00:30:35,458 --> 00:30:36,793
What for?

484
00:30:36,876 --> 00:30:39,128
Well, that's because…

485
00:30:39,212 --> 00:30:40,046
Why…

486
00:30:40,922 --> 00:30:42,924
did you steal from the warehouse?

487
00:30:43,007 --> 00:30:44,384
How did you know?

488
00:30:44,467 --> 00:30:47,846
I'm the manager here.
Did you think I wouldn't notice?

489
00:30:51,641 --> 00:30:52,892
Where's the CEO's office?

490
00:30:56,521 --> 00:30:57,355
Hello?

491
00:30:57,438 --> 00:30:58,648
Gan I-sik.

492
00:30:58,731 --> 00:31:02,026
I got caught stealing.

493
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:03,778
The manager must've seen me.

494
00:31:03,862 --> 00:31:04,737
What?

495
00:31:04,821 --> 00:31:06,906
So the CEO summoned me.

496
00:31:07,532 --> 00:31:08,408
As in Ryu Si-o?

497
00:31:08,491 --> 00:31:09,784
It's a great opportunity.

498
00:31:11,035 --> 00:31:13,580
I'll get close to the CEO
and dig up information.

499
00:31:13,663 --> 00:31:16,040
That's not as easy as you think.

500
00:31:16,124 --> 00:31:17,458
Don't worry.

501
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:19,836
I'm Gang Nam-soon, remember?

502
00:31:21,963 --> 00:31:24,591
Why is she so reckless?

503
00:31:28,469 --> 00:31:29,429
Hey, Young-tak.

504
00:31:29,512 --> 00:31:31,598
What's taking you so long?

505
00:31:31,681 --> 00:31:33,141
The briefing's about to start.

506
00:31:33,224 --> 00:31:34,434
Right.

507
00:31:42,567 --> 00:31:44,193
I must get his list of clients.

508
00:31:44,277 --> 00:31:46,613
I'm a cop now, albeit a fake one.

509
00:31:46,696 --> 00:31:47,739
I sure am!

510
00:31:55,538 --> 00:31:56,497
Hi.

511
00:31:59,375 --> 00:32:00,209
Dummy.

512
00:32:38,206 --> 00:32:40,124
Hi, I'm Tsetseg.

513
00:32:41,167 --> 00:32:42,293
It's a pleasure.

514
00:32:42,919 --> 00:32:43,962
I'm Ryu Si-o.

515
00:32:44,045 --> 00:32:45,421
Nice to meet you too.

516
00:32:46,005 --> 00:32:47,799
She doesn't bother with honorifics.

517
00:32:47,882 --> 00:32:50,009
-Can you leave us?
-Yes, sir.

518
00:32:53,471 --> 00:32:55,139
I apologize for stealing.

519
00:32:55,932 --> 00:32:58,601
I wanted to give them
to my parents in Mongolia.

520
00:32:59,185 --> 00:33:02,397
In Mongolia, white symbolizes greatness.

521
00:33:03,314 --> 00:33:05,733
I wanted to get them souvenirs from Korea,

522
00:33:06,442 --> 00:33:09,487
but I haven't been paid yet.

523
00:33:10,446 --> 00:33:12,699
Just dock it off my salary, okay?

524
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:14,951
You sure are bold.

525
00:33:16,577 --> 00:33:17,996
Where in Mongolia are you from?

526
00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:21,165
Just a small village.

527
00:33:22,125 --> 00:33:23,167
As if you'd know it.

528
00:33:24,335 --> 00:33:25,545
It's odd.

529
00:33:26,629 --> 00:33:29,716
It's difficult to send deliveries
to areas other than Ulaanbaatar.

530
00:33:32,301 --> 00:33:35,555
Back in the day,
only express mail was available,

531
00:33:35,638 --> 00:33:38,641
but other services carry out
all sorts of deliveries these days.

532
00:33:38,725 --> 00:33:40,893
The CEO of a logistics company
should know that.

533
00:33:40,977 --> 00:33:42,353
I'm mesmerized.

534
00:33:43,938 --> 00:33:47,150
Mesmerized by what?

535
00:33:47,775 --> 00:33:50,028
You, Tsetseg.

536
00:33:54,198 --> 00:33:56,576
Do you want to be friends with me?

537
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:01,664
Yes, I do.

538
00:34:02,331 --> 00:34:03,583
Then…

539
00:34:05,501 --> 00:34:06,461
give me your number.

540
00:34:22,602 --> 00:34:24,062
Since we've exchanged numbers,

541
00:34:25,188 --> 00:34:26,814
how about having dinner with me tonight?

542
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:28,024
Dinner?

543
00:34:28,816 --> 00:34:30,401
No, I have plans.

544
00:34:30,485 --> 00:34:33,237
I'll pick a date and text you.

545
00:34:33,321 --> 00:34:34,238
We'll eat then.

546
00:34:34,947 --> 00:34:36,240
You can treat me to meat.

547
00:34:37,158 --> 00:34:39,077
I guess I'll have to wait for next time.

548
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:40,536
I guess so.

549
00:34:43,623 --> 00:34:44,665
Anyway,

550
00:34:44,749 --> 00:34:47,001
I won't steal again. Sorry about that.

551
00:34:51,047 --> 00:34:52,340
Make sure to contact me.

552
00:34:53,633 --> 00:34:54,717
I'll treat you…

553
00:34:55,968 --> 00:34:57,220
to meat.

554
00:34:57,303 --> 00:34:58,304
Okay.

555
00:35:12,401 --> 00:35:14,070
How did it go, Nam-soon?

556
00:35:14,153 --> 00:35:15,655
-I got his number.
-What?

557
00:35:15,738 --> 00:35:17,490
I got the CEO's phone number.

558
00:35:18,074 --> 00:35:20,952
Let's now come up with a plan
to get his list of clients.

559
00:35:21,536 --> 00:35:23,788
Wait in the warehouse parking lot.
I'm almost there.

560
00:35:26,916 --> 00:35:28,918
She got his phone number?

561
00:35:30,211 --> 00:35:31,379
Hey, Dad.

562
00:35:32,213 --> 00:35:34,257
I won't be long. I'll head right there.

563
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:35,341
Bye.

564
00:35:40,221 --> 00:35:41,347
Gan I-sik.

565
00:35:41,931 --> 00:35:43,391
What on earth happened?

566
00:35:45,017 --> 00:35:46,602
How did you get out of stealing the items?

567
00:35:46,686 --> 00:35:48,354
I dealt with it the Mongolian way.

568
00:35:48,437 --> 00:35:49,397
What?

569
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:50,815
I'll tell you about it later.

570
00:35:50,898 --> 00:35:52,984
I have to go. My dad's waiting for me.

571
00:35:54,485 --> 00:35:57,196
Did you get all dressed up
to meet your dad?

572
00:36:00,241 --> 00:36:01,868
I noticed

573
00:36:01,951 --> 00:36:05,121
that's how Korean men in K-dramas
tell girls that they're pretty.

574
00:36:06,038 --> 00:36:08,416
And they also do things like this.

575
00:36:11,878 --> 00:36:13,963
"Catch me if you can."

576
00:36:15,673 --> 00:36:17,633
Just wait till I catch you.

577
00:36:19,552 --> 00:36:20,845
Are you really going to catch me?

578
00:36:20,928 --> 00:36:22,054
Hold on.

579
00:36:22,138 --> 00:36:24,140
Hey, wait. Are you serious?

580
00:36:24,849 --> 00:36:26,309
Are you coming after me?

581
00:36:27,351 --> 00:36:29,312
Hey, stop!

582
00:36:42,575 --> 00:36:44,869
-Dad!
-Nam-soon!

583
00:36:47,288 --> 00:36:48,164
Hello, sir.

584
00:36:50,082 --> 00:36:50,958
Who…

585
00:36:51,542 --> 00:36:52,835
I'm Kang Hee-sik.

586
00:36:55,796 --> 00:36:57,006
Are you her boyfriend?

587
00:36:59,634 --> 00:37:01,385
No, we're just friends, sir.

588
00:37:03,179 --> 00:37:04,138
You look familiar.

589
00:37:04,222 --> 00:37:06,515
I visited your photo studio once.

590
00:37:07,099 --> 00:37:09,894
I handed the coupon you gave me
to Nam-soon.

591
00:37:10,937 --> 00:37:12,813
That's why she went there
for her passport photo.

592
00:37:13,606 --> 00:37:14,857
Goodness.

593
00:37:16,609 --> 00:37:18,069
How surprising is that?

594
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:20,988
Enjoy your time then.

595
00:37:23,741 --> 00:37:24,659
Bye.

596
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:29,497
-Dad, let's go.
-Okay.

597
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:42,134
Dad!

598
00:37:43,970 --> 00:37:44,971
Giddy-up!

599
00:37:46,138 --> 00:37:48,015
No, please don't take photos.

600
00:37:49,016 --> 00:37:51,018
-We're here.
-Hello.

601
00:37:51,102 --> 00:37:52,478
No photos, please.

602
00:37:52,561 --> 00:37:54,021
Please don't take photos.

603
00:37:54,105 --> 00:37:55,940
No photos, please.

604
00:37:57,692 --> 00:37:59,694
Dad, let's have those.

605
00:38:00,319 --> 00:38:01,570
Thank you.

606
00:38:16,127 --> 00:38:17,169
Hi!

607
00:38:25,553 --> 00:38:26,512
Did you have fun?

608
00:38:27,471 --> 00:38:29,015
Yeah, totally.

609
00:38:30,016 --> 00:38:33,436
If I hadn't lost you,
I would've brought you here ages ago.

610
00:38:34,061 --> 00:38:35,980
It took us so long

611
00:38:36,897 --> 00:38:39,066
just to step foot in here.

612
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:41,319
Better late than never, right?

613
00:38:41,402 --> 00:38:43,654
I had the best time, Dad.

614
00:38:46,866 --> 00:38:48,951
I took you to the Gobi Desert in Mongolia

615
00:38:49,035 --> 00:38:51,120
because I wanted you to see the stars.

616
00:38:51,871 --> 00:38:55,166
You enjoyed stargazing with me
when you were little.

617
00:38:57,001 --> 00:38:59,045
Your mom was busy with work,

618
00:38:59,587 --> 00:39:01,047
so I was the one raising you.

619
00:39:01,881 --> 00:39:03,883
At night, you kept leaving the house.

620
00:39:03,966 --> 00:39:07,386
I followed you out
just to see you sitting like this

621
00:39:08,554 --> 00:39:10,139
gazing at the stars.

622
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:11,974
You told me

623
00:39:12,058 --> 00:39:15,144
you'd love to jump high enough
to reach one.

624
00:39:16,103 --> 00:39:18,898
That wouldn't have worried other dads,

625
00:39:20,191 --> 00:39:21,776
but it wasn't the case for me.

626
00:39:24,445 --> 00:39:26,322
Because I knew you could jump that high.

627
00:39:29,867 --> 00:39:32,495
Did I ever attempt it?

628
00:39:32,578 --> 00:39:33,788
You did.

629
00:39:35,998 --> 00:39:39,377
You jumped from the rooftop
to pluck the stars from the sky

630
00:39:40,586 --> 00:39:41,420
but fell.

631
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:45,591
And you got hurt.

632
00:39:50,429 --> 00:39:53,682
Your mom doesn't worry about you
because you're strong.

633
00:39:54,183 --> 00:39:56,018
But that's because she didn't raise you.

634
00:39:57,144 --> 00:39:58,312
As for me…

635
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:03,317
I'm constantly concerned
for your well-being.

636
00:40:06,112 --> 00:40:07,738
After losing you,

637
00:40:07,822 --> 00:40:10,241
my mind was never at ease.

638
00:40:12,701 --> 00:40:13,953
I worried for your safety.

639
00:40:16,247 --> 00:40:19,250
I was worried you'd jump,
trying to pluck the stars again.

640
00:40:22,878 --> 00:40:24,046
I'm sorry.

641
00:40:27,967 --> 00:40:29,468
I should be the one apologizing.

642
00:40:30,636 --> 00:40:31,679
Dad.

643
00:40:33,889 --> 00:40:37,059
I'll never mention plucking stars again,

644
00:40:37,852 --> 00:40:39,645
so don't worry.

645
00:40:43,774 --> 00:40:45,484
Promise me

646
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:47,361
that you'll never get hurt

647
00:40:48,612 --> 00:40:51,407
and that you won't do anything dangerous.

648
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:54,326
Got it.

649
00:40:55,077 --> 00:40:56,036
I promise.

650
00:41:17,933 --> 00:41:20,060
Sir, it's about Hwang Geum-ju.

651
00:41:20,144 --> 00:41:21,687
She recently found her lost daughter.

652
00:41:21,770 --> 00:41:23,355
Her lost daughter?

653
00:41:23,439 --> 00:41:26,442
Apparently, she was the woman
working at Doogo under a false identity,

654
00:41:26,525 --> 00:41:27,735
Lee Myung-hee.

655
00:41:27,818 --> 00:41:29,612
The one who got hurt
while fighting with Tsetseg.

656
00:41:30,362 --> 00:41:31,864
However, the real daughter appeared,

657
00:41:31,947 --> 00:41:34,200
which exposed Lee Myung-hee as a fake.

658
00:41:34,283 --> 00:41:36,410
What's the source
regarding the real daughter?

659
00:41:36,494 --> 00:41:37,703
Geumju Daily, sir.

660
00:41:37,786 --> 00:41:40,164
The daily newspaper
owned by Hwang Geum-ju.

661
00:41:40,247 --> 00:41:42,917
She bought the newspaper company
to find her daughter.

662
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,628
The article also features
a photo of the real daughter.

663
00:41:45,711 --> 00:41:47,129
Send it to me now.

664
00:41:56,472 --> 00:41:57,431
HWANG GEUM-JU REUNITES WITH DAUGHTER

665
00:42:03,312 --> 00:42:04,855
BEOM

666
00:42:18,744 --> 00:42:19,870
Nice shot.

667
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:30,172
My swing has gotten better
thanks to the great facilities here.

668
00:42:30,839 --> 00:42:31,882
Thank you.

669
00:42:47,815 --> 00:42:50,442
NEW NOTIFICATIONS

670
00:42:52,903 --> 00:42:53,946
MATCH OF THE DAY!

671
00:43:12,965 --> 00:43:16,260
How gutsy of you to arrive
after the briefing is over.

672
00:43:18,345 --> 00:43:20,180
It's not like I was out partying.

673
00:43:20,264 --> 00:43:23,892
You're more like a Doogo employee
than a DIU detective these days.

674
00:43:23,976 --> 00:43:25,436
It must be up your alley.

675
00:43:25,519 --> 00:43:27,438
I'm too tired to take your joke.

676
00:43:28,564 --> 00:43:29,398
Wait.

677
00:43:29,481 --> 00:43:31,066
Can you look into Doogo's server?

678
00:43:31,609 --> 00:43:32,443
Doogo's server?

679
00:43:32,526 --> 00:43:35,070
The listed items on sale
are on its website and app.

680
00:43:35,154 --> 00:43:38,407
Dig into the server and follow the items
by tracking their source codes.

681
00:43:38,490 --> 00:43:40,784
That might lead us
to drugs disguised as benign goods.

682
00:43:42,578 --> 00:43:43,537
Hee-sik,

683
00:43:44,121 --> 00:43:48,042
I've been swamped
with all kinds of work lately.

684
00:43:48,584 --> 00:43:51,295
My heart's pounding from lack of sleep.

685
00:43:51,378 --> 00:43:53,881
Goodness, Chamma.

686
00:43:57,134 --> 00:43:58,010
I'll leave you to it.

687
00:43:59,136 --> 00:44:00,346
What should I tell the others?

688
00:44:01,055 --> 00:44:02,514
That's for you to figure out.

689
00:44:04,266 --> 00:44:05,601
Are you serious?

690
00:44:11,857 --> 00:44:13,275
MISSED CALLS
DIU OH YOUNG-TAK

691
00:44:15,694 --> 00:44:17,905
Inspector Kang, tomorrow at 6 p.m.,

692
00:44:17,988 --> 00:44:20,741
there will be a party
at Geumju Hotel's Superior Room.

693
00:44:20,824 --> 00:44:22,493
I hope to see you there.

694
00:44:22,576 --> 00:44:23,577
A party?

695
00:44:24,828 --> 00:44:26,205
Finishing touches, everyone.

696
00:44:26,288 --> 00:44:27,915
Make sure this is straight.

697
00:44:27,998 --> 00:44:29,083
Good job.

698
00:44:29,166 --> 00:44:30,876
Those flowers aren't the right color.

699
00:44:30,959 --> 00:44:32,795
Wipe that. No, over there.

700
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:35,464
Okay, everyone. Smile.

701
00:44:36,256 --> 00:44:37,716
All right. We're good.

702
00:45:01,156 --> 00:45:02,533
Not here yet?

703
00:45:04,201 --> 00:45:06,036
-Are you Mr. Seo Jun-hee?
-Yes.

704
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:07,413
Right. This way, please.

705
00:45:14,503 --> 00:45:15,587
You're here.

706
00:45:35,607 --> 00:45:36,442
Gan I-sik.

707
00:45:48,912 --> 00:45:52,499
I've invited
all the family members here today

708
00:45:52,583 --> 00:45:54,334
to make an important announcement.

709
00:45:55,210 --> 00:45:57,796
I thank Mr. Seo Jun-hee

710
00:45:59,006 --> 00:46:00,924
and Mr. Kang Hee-sik

711
00:46:02,092 --> 00:46:03,343
for sparing their time.

712
00:46:03,427 --> 00:46:06,346
Please go ahead
and introduce yourselves briefly.

713
00:46:16,857 --> 00:46:18,317
Hello, I'm Kang Hee-sik,

714
00:46:19,443 --> 00:46:21,069
and I'm a police officer.

715
00:46:21,153 --> 00:46:23,322
What's your relationship with Nam-soon?

716
00:46:26,617 --> 00:46:28,619
It's hard to say for sure yet,

717
00:46:30,496 --> 00:46:32,998
but I guess we need one another.

718
00:46:36,376 --> 00:46:37,544
Jun-hee.

719
00:46:40,964 --> 00:46:42,132
Hello.

720
00:46:42,216 --> 00:46:44,635
I'm Seo Jun-hee,

721
00:46:45,219 --> 00:46:47,471
and I'm a barista.

722
00:46:48,347 --> 00:46:49,473
Ms. Gil and I…

723
00:46:51,308 --> 00:46:52,518
are dating.

724
00:46:55,062 --> 00:46:57,272
That was wonderful, Jun-hee.

725
00:46:57,356 --> 00:46:58,857
Are you aware

726
00:46:58,941 --> 00:47:01,360
that my mother has a sickly son?

727
00:47:01,443 --> 00:47:02,486
I heard about that.

728
00:47:02,569 --> 00:47:06,949
Are you also aware she's still married
to a man who walked out on her?

729
00:47:08,075 --> 00:47:08,992
Yes.

730
00:47:09,618 --> 00:47:10,911
I heard about that too.

731
00:47:10,994 --> 00:47:13,956
I also heard
he's been missing for a decade.

732
00:47:14,039 --> 00:47:14,873
WHAT'S WITH THE MOOD?

733
00:47:14,957 --> 00:47:16,083
THIS IS ALL THE TYRANT'S FAULT

734
00:47:16,166 --> 00:47:18,502
No contact for a decade
qualifies as an automatic divorce.

735
00:47:18,585 --> 00:47:20,671
Don't be a buzzkill on this fine evening.

736
00:47:22,839 --> 00:47:25,842
I appreciate you all being here.

737
00:47:25,926 --> 00:47:26,969
Anyway,

738
00:47:27,970 --> 00:47:31,640
I wish for nothing more
than a double rainbow

739
00:47:31,723 --> 00:47:34,309
in my dear Ms. Gil and Mr. Seo's future.

740
00:47:35,143 --> 00:47:36,687
We'll begin today's party

741
00:47:37,312 --> 00:47:39,147
with an apéritif.

742
00:47:45,654 --> 00:47:47,781
Cheers, everyone.

743
00:47:49,658 --> 00:47:50,492
Also,

744
00:47:51,827 --> 00:47:53,078
please know

745
00:47:53,745 --> 00:47:56,164
that I'll have Nam-soon
consummate this year.

746
00:47:56,248 --> 00:48:00,002
We have a tradition to uphold.

747
00:48:02,504 --> 00:48:03,422
Right.

748
00:48:11,805 --> 00:48:12,848
Now,

749
00:48:12,931 --> 00:48:16,143
there's something I must announce
to the whole family.

750
00:48:17,769 --> 00:48:18,812
I'm…

751
00:48:19,396 --> 00:48:20,564
pregnant.

752
00:48:22,399 --> 00:48:24,526
I won't drink for the baby's sake.

753
00:48:27,779 --> 00:48:28,947
The father…

754
00:48:30,949 --> 00:48:32,618
is Mr. Gang Bong-go.

755
00:48:35,203 --> 00:48:38,081
Ms. Jung, why would you
joke about something like that?

756
00:48:38,165 --> 00:48:40,626
Mr. Gang, it's time we came clean.

757
00:48:40,709 --> 00:48:41,877
What's there to be scared of?

758
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:43,587
We can be open about our love!

759
00:48:43,670 --> 00:48:45,213
What on earth are you saying?

760
00:48:45,297 --> 00:48:46,882
Why are you doing this to me?

761
00:48:46,965 --> 00:48:49,635
-No, it's not true.
-Ex-brother-in-law!

762
00:48:49,718 --> 00:48:51,053
How could you?

763
00:48:51,136 --> 00:48:53,430
I'm telling you, it's not me!

764
00:48:53,513 --> 00:48:55,432
Think of our growing baby.

765
00:48:55,515 --> 00:48:58,143
It's over between you two anyway!

766
00:48:58,226 --> 00:49:01,396
Well, aren't you a free soul.

767
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:03,190
You're not in Hollywood, you know.

768
00:49:03,273 --> 00:49:05,651
Dad, I'm disappointed in you!

769
00:49:05,734 --> 00:49:07,694
It's not true!

770
00:49:07,778 --> 00:49:10,364
You're not my dad anymore!

771
00:49:11,031 --> 00:49:12,574
Nam-soon, I'm not that kind of person!

772
00:49:13,909 --> 00:49:15,661
Geum-ju!

773
00:49:16,787 --> 00:49:17,871
Water!

774
00:49:17,954 --> 00:49:19,790
-Open the bottle for me!
-Ms. Hwang!

775
00:49:19,873 --> 00:49:21,917
-It's not true.
-No!

776
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:25,545
I swear none of this is true!

777
00:49:28,548 --> 00:49:31,051
Surprise.

778
00:49:31,134 --> 00:49:32,094
-Dad.
-Dad.

779
00:49:32,177 --> 00:49:34,179
-Happy birthday!
-Happy birthday!

780
00:49:34,262 --> 00:49:35,639
Happy birthday.

781
00:49:35,722 --> 00:49:37,724
Happy birthday, brother-in-law.

782
00:49:37,808 --> 00:49:38,684
-Happy birthday.
-Happy birthday.

783
00:49:38,767 --> 00:49:40,394
Did you have to go this far?

784
00:49:46,108 --> 00:49:48,652
Happy birthday, Bong-go.

785
00:49:48,735 --> 00:49:50,028
THE BEST DAYS OF YOUR LIFE
LIE AHEAD OF YOU, BONG-GO

786
00:49:56,910 --> 00:49:57,911
MAN I WANT TO PROTECT, BONG-GO

787
00:50:29,067 --> 00:50:32,362
I always ask you

788
00:50:33,947 --> 00:50:38,368
When, how, and where

789
00:50:39,870 --> 00:50:44,833
You always answer me

790
00:50:45,959 --> 00:50:50,338
Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps

791
00:50:52,507 --> 00:50:54,968
You're wasting your time

792
00:50:55,844 --> 00:50:57,554
Think about it

793
00:50:58,054 --> 00:50:59,890
Just think

794
00:51:01,391 --> 00:51:04,603
Think about what you truly want

795
00:51:04,686 --> 00:51:09,524
How long will you keep me hanging?

796
00:51:11,026 --> 00:51:14,196
As days pass me by

797
00:51:14,279 --> 00:51:17,866
My despair grows

798
00:51:18,575 --> 00:51:22,913
But then you reply with

799
00:51:22,996 --> 00:51:26,833
Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps

800
00:51:33,173 --> 00:51:35,467
You're wasting your time…

801
00:51:36,635 --> 00:51:38,845
I'M SICK OF HWANG GEUM-JU
ALWAYS GOING OVERBOARD

802
00:51:38,929 --> 00:51:41,598
I LIKE THIS YEAR'S PARTY,
THE IDEA WAS UNIQUE

803
00:52:13,922 --> 00:52:16,132
More.

804
00:52:19,886 --> 00:52:21,137
Drink up

805
00:52:21,930 --> 00:52:23,557
if you wish to leave in one piece.

806
00:52:43,535 --> 00:52:44,452
Cheers!

807
00:52:44,536 --> 00:52:46,746
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

808
00:53:00,886 --> 00:53:03,430
-Joong-gan.
-What is it, Jun-hee?

809
00:53:03,513 --> 00:53:06,016
I'm going to love you all I want.

810
00:53:06,099 --> 00:53:07,976
-Do you mean that?
-Yes.

811
00:53:08,059 --> 00:53:12,147
My gosh, I'm so happy!

812
00:53:12,772 --> 00:53:13,940
I'm so happy.

813
00:53:14,024 --> 00:53:16,985
So am I.

814
00:53:26,244 --> 00:53:28,371
Do you miss your parents in Mongolia?

815
00:53:28,955 --> 00:53:30,332
The ones who raised you.

816
00:53:32,751 --> 00:53:35,670
I do miss them.

817
00:53:36,338 --> 00:53:38,715
If I could,
I'd love to live with them too.

818
00:53:41,718 --> 00:53:43,595
The most painful thing in life

819
00:53:45,513 --> 00:53:47,390
is parting with our loved ones.

820
00:53:48,266 --> 00:53:49,434
Has that happened to you?

821
00:53:50,143 --> 00:53:50,977
Yes.

822
00:53:53,146 --> 00:53:54,314
My older brother.

823
00:53:56,983 --> 00:53:58,735
When I was 18,

824
00:54:01,696 --> 00:54:03,531
he became a star in the sky.

825
00:54:06,034 --> 00:54:08,119
He was studying in the US…

826
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:12,374
when he died in a shooting incident.

827
00:54:17,379 --> 00:54:18,463
So that's why

828
00:54:19,214 --> 00:54:21,508
you became a police officer.

829
00:54:28,974 --> 00:54:31,226
Be good to the twin brother
you reunited with.

830
00:54:31,851 --> 00:54:33,311
If only my brother were alive,

831
00:54:35,814 --> 00:54:38,108
I'd gladly give him all that I have.

832
00:54:40,735 --> 00:54:42,696
Okay, I will.

833
00:54:45,615 --> 00:54:46,700
Gan I-sik.

834
00:54:48,118 --> 00:54:51,705
You still managed
to bravely overcome everything.

835
00:54:52,956 --> 00:54:54,541
Good for you, my brother.

836
00:55:01,339 --> 00:55:03,133
I feel better whenever I'm around you.

837
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:07,762
You always lighten up my mood.

838
00:55:10,932 --> 00:55:12,100
I feel the same way.

839
00:55:24,320 --> 00:55:26,031
-Really?
-I love you.

840
00:55:26,114 --> 00:55:28,158
Goodness me!

841
00:55:28,241 --> 00:55:29,617
Jun-hee!

842
00:55:29,701 --> 00:55:30,869
Oh, dear.

843
00:55:39,711 --> 00:55:42,213
Hey, is the suite vacant?

844
00:55:42,297 --> 00:55:43,256
Take him home.

845
00:55:43,339 --> 00:55:45,091
-I'll call a chauffeur.
-No way.

846
00:55:45,175 --> 00:55:47,093
Why bother when we're at a hotel?

847
00:55:47,177 --> 00:55:48,386
Have the suite ready.

848
00:55:52,724 --> 00:55:54,934
Here, have some cheese.

849
00:56:18,416 --> 00:56:22,128
I bet that over-the-top event
was all Geum-ju's idea.

850
00:56:22,212 --> 00:56:23,296
Of course.

851
00:56:23,838 --> 00:56:26,091
You know being over-the-top
is her specialty.

852
00:56:26,841 --> 00:56:28,343
You drank a lot today.

853
00:56:29,427 --> 00:56:31,930
It was to test you
as a possible son-in-law.

854
00:56:32,013 --> 00:56:34,265
My ex-brother-in-law also passed that test

855
00:56:34,349 --> 00:56:36,184
by drinking a truckload of alcohol.

856
00:56:36,267 --> 00:56:38,686
Geum-ju drank almost 80% of it.

857
00:56:38,770 --> 00:56:39,938
Don't burden the kid.

858
00:56:40,730 --> 00:56:42,357
He said they were just friends.

859
00:56:43,149 --> 00:56:45,902
Nam-soon isn't like my mom.

860
00:56:45,985 --> 00:56:48,071
She's a sweet person,
so don't break her heart.

861
00:56:49,364 --> 00:56:50,240
I won't.

862
00:56:52,992 --> 00:56:54,077
You must have a daughter.

863
00:56:55,829 --> 00:56:58,331
That's your fate
should you marry into this family.

864
00:56:58,414 --> 00:57:01,167
You must give her a daughter.

865
00:57:02,377 --> 00:57:04,254
You must help continue their bloodline.

866
00:57:05,505 --> 00:57:06,965
He's a sweet little thing.

867
00:57:07,048 --> 00:57:08,633
I wouldn't mind stealing him away.

868
00:57:09,259 --> 00:57:10,760
But these days,

869
00:57:10,844 --> 00:57:12,762
that'd be considered kidnapping.

870
00:57:13,763 --> 00:57:15,807
Grandma, isn't Gan I-sik handsome?

871
00:57:15,890 --> 00:57:16,766
He is.

872
00:57:16,850 --> 00:57:18,643
He's a handsome young fellow.

873
00:57:18,726 --> 00:57:22,021
Your partner must be handsome
to have a pretty daughter.

874
00:57:22,689 --> 00:57:24,607
There's more to it than just looks,

875
00:57:24,691 --> 00:57:25,900
so take a closer look.

876
00:57:26,943 --> 00:57:29,779
Things ended up this way for me
because I only valued looks.

877
00:57:29,863 --> 00:57:30,864
Hey.

878
00:57:30,947 --> 00:57:33,241
Is Bong-go that handsome in your eyes?

879
00:57:33,324 --> 00:57:35,994
He's not so bad to look at.

880
00:57:36,077 --> 00:57:37,579
It's just that he's an idiot.

881
00:57:37,662 --> 00:57:39,914
His facial features stand out,

882
00:57:39,998 --> 00:57:42,834
and he has a pretty head and ears.

883
00:57:42,917 --> 00:57:44,627
"A pretty head and ears"?

884
00:57:44,711 --> 00:57:46,546
Why not just say
his third toe is also pretty?

885
00:57:48,339 --> 00:57:50,425
Then why did you divorce him?

886
00:57:50,925 --> 00:57:52,510
You should get back together with him

887
00:57:52,594 --> 00:57:54,804
-now that you found Nam-soon.
-No way.

888
00:57:56,556 --> 00:57:59,350
We only got on better terms
after the divorce.

889
00:58:00,477 --> 00:58:03,521
If we live together,
we'll only end up arguing again.

890
00:58:13,323 --> 00:58:14,782
Anyway,

891
00:58:15,950 --> 00:58:19,412
I should get going
since I have an early morning shift.

892
00:58:19,496 --> 00:58:21,331
-Sure.
-Goodbye.

893
00:58:21,414 --> 00:58:23,082
We won't see you out.

894
00:58:23,166 --> 00:58:24,000
Sure.

895
00:58:33,176 --> 00:58:34,344
I like him.

896
00:58:34,427 --> 00:58:35,553
Me too.

897
00:58:35,637 --> 00:58:36,763
I wonder if he cooks.

898
00:58:36,846 --> 00:58:39,098
That's important for a man of this house.

899
00:58:44,229 --> 00:58:47,857
I can't believe
there came a day for us three

900
00:58:47,941 --> 00:58:51,194
to drink and take a bath together.

901
00:58:54,822 --> 00:58:57,492
The moon over Seoul
looks so big for a change.

902
00:58:58,117 --> 00:59:01,704
The sky in Mongolia is clear,
and the moon is always big.

903
00:59:02,455 --> 00:59:05,041
We often see
rainbow-colored aurora as well.

904
00:59:05,124 --> 00:59:08,044
How about I make a moonbow for you?

905
00:59:08,586 --> 00:59:09,420
How?

906
00:59:15,969 --> 00:59:16,970
All right.

907
00:59:18,721 --> 00:59:19,847
Get ready.

908
00:59:22,642 --> 00:59:24,477
At the count of three,

909
00:59:24,561 --> 00:59:26,354
toss the water in the air.

910
00:59:27,021 --> 00:59:27,981
One,

911
00:59:28,064 --> 00:59:29,232
two,

912
00:59:30,191 --> 00:59:31,484
three!

913
00:59:43,621 --> 00:59:45,039
Rain? Out of the blue?

914
00:59:45,873 --> 00:59:47,083
What's going on?

915
00:59:57,594 --> 01:00:00,471
We can make moonbows like this.

916
01:00:00,555 --> 01:00:01,556
That being said,

917
01:00:01,639 --> 01:00:03,766
since we have such special privileges,

918
01:00:04,934 --> 01:00:06,644
we should give back to the world.

919
01:00:08,479 --> 01:00:09,564
Right.

920
01:00:19,449 --> 01:00:20,450
Sir.

921
01:00:20,533 --> 01:00:21,409
Sir?

922
01:00:22,660 --> 01:00:24,621
-What the…
-Call an ambulance.

923
01:00:25,622 --> 01:00:28,333
The CEO just asked me to his office.

924
01:00:28,416 --> 01:00:30,043
He told me not to work
in the warehouse anymore.

925
01:00:30,668 --> 01:00:32,754
-What?
-I'll call you back later.

926
01:00:36,299 --> 01:00:38,009
Have you been able
to contact the team leader?

927
01:00:38,092 --> 01:00:40,386
He hasn't clocked in
and isn't answering his phone.

928
01:00:51,022 --> 01:00:52,190
Welcome.

929
01:00:54,942 --> 01:00:56,069
You want to make money, right?

930
01:00:59,197 --> 01:01:00,698
I’d like to take you

931
01:01:01,532 --> 01:01:02,784
under my wing.

932
01:01:05,495 --> 01:01:06,621
Well,

933
01:01:06,704 --> 01:01:09,874
how could you do that
when you don’t have any wings?

934
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:11,876
Become one of my people.

935
01:01:13,628 --> 01:01:14,712
I want to…

936
01:01:16,005 --> 01:01:18,007
train you as Doogo's lobbyist.

937
01:01:21,135 --> 01:01:22,970
You'll have wealth and honor.

938
01:01:24,806 --> 01:01:26,641
I can change your life.

939
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:31,479
I'm in.

940
01:01:35,358 --> 01:01:36,901
First, you must pass a test.

941
01:01:38,319 --> 01:01:39,153
A test?

942
01:01:39,696 --> 01:01:41,447
GANGHAN POLICE PRECINCT

943
01:02:01,426 --> 01:02:02,385
Don't be nervous.

944
01:02:05,388 --> 01:02:06,973
I'm not going to let you die.

945
01:03:44,946 --> 01:03:47,615
STRONG GIRL NAM-SOON

946
01:03:47,698 --> 01:03:49,909
-Step back from this case.
-But I'm just getting started.

947
01:03:49,992 --> 01:03:51,410
Ryu Si-o's a dangerous man.

948
01:03:51,494 --> 01:03:52,995
I can't let you be by his side.

949
01:03:53,079 --> 01:03:54,330
I'm going to make her mine.

950
01:03:54,413 --> 01:03:56,582
She may be a gift from above.

951
01:03:56,666 --> 01:04:00,002
I'll go to his office tonight
and get the client list.

952
01:04:00,086 --> 01:04:02,213
Why did I trust her
and let her go in on her own?

953
01:04:02,296 --> 01:04:04,173
It seemed like she had a plan.

954
01:04:04,257 --> 01:04:06,634
That Bread Song is a mystery.

955
01:04:06,717 --> 01:04:09,053
What are you doing there?

956
01:04:09,136 --> 01:04:11,514
Try some when you wish to be happy.

957
01:04:11,597 --> 01:04:12,974
It'll grant you the ultimate bliss.

958
01:04:13,057 --> 01:04:14,642
We're getting closer to the truth.

959
01:04:14,725 --> 01:04:16,018
The clinical trial is over.

960
01:04:16,102 --> 01:04:17,395
It's perfect.

961
01:04:18,771 --> 01:04:23,776
