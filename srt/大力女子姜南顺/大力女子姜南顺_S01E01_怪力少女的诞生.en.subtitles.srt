1
00:00:42,667 --> 00:00:45,962
STRONG GIRL NAM-SOON

2
00:02:06,251 --> 00:02:08,628
MONGOLIA

3
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:14,509
Meet last year's champion, Baatar!

4
00:02:23,935 --> 00:02:25,645
And here is his opponent,

5
00:02:25,728 --> 00:02:26,813
Tsetseg!

6
00:02:58,469 --> 00:03:00,138
Fight!

7
00:04:08,456 --> 00:04:12,001
-Tsetseg!
-Tsetseg!

8
00:04:15,797 --> 00:04:18,007
EPISODE 1
BIRTH OF THE STRONG GIRL

9
00:04:19,217 --> 00:04:21,678
SEOUL, YEAR 2013

10
00:04:23,846 --> 00:04:25,348
I wonder if Nam-soon

11
00:04:26,224 --> 00:04:27,892
is doing well.

12
00:04:27,976 --> 00:04:30,103
You lost her when she was at a tender age.

13
00:04:30,186 --> 00:04:31,437
I'm to blame.

14
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:36,234
I shouldn't have taken her to Mongolia.

15
00:04:36,818 --> 00:04:39,028
Who knew that'd be
our last moment together?

16
00:04:39,654 --> 00:04:42,031
But at least you have these photos of her

17
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:44,075
to keep her alive in your memory.

18
00:04:44,158 --> 00:04:46,202
She can't stay as a memory.
I must find her.

19
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:47,704
Speaking of which,

20
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:49,497
please write up a decent piece.

21
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:51,749
-She might be in Korea.
-Of course.

22
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:55,545
Does your daughter
have any distinctive characteristics?

23
00:04:56,504 --> 00:04:57,630
She's strong.

24
00:04:58,131 --> 00:05:01,009
Find the world's strongest girl.

25
00:05:01,092 --> 00:05:02,135
CEO HWANG GEUM-JU

26
00:05:02,218 --> 00:05:04,345
Ms. Hwang, I have an idea.

27
00:05:04,429 --> 00:05:08,433
How about we host a strength contest
for girls all over the world

28
00:05:08,516 --> 00:05:10,643
between the ages of 12 and 15?

29
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:12,770
A prize pool of a billion won

30
00:05:12,854 --> 00:05:14,689
will get people talking,

31
00:05:14,772 --> 00:05:17,233
and we can expect a huge turnout.

32
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:18,609
Hey, Kim Nam-gil.

33
00:05:20,278 --> 00:05:24,115
You may be a ditz,
but you do have moments of brilliance.

34
00:05:24,615 --> 00:05:26,117
This is why I keep you around.

35
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,535
Thank you.

36
00:05:27,618 --> 00:05:29,078
What a spectacular idea.

37
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:32,498
She won't be hard to find
if we limit it to girls of Asian descent.

38
00:05:32,582 --> 00:05:35,793
Since she's your daughter,
she'll be a Korean girl with dark hair.

39
00:05:35,877 --> 00:05:36,836
Right.

40
00:05:37,462 --> 00:05:40,214
She could've left Mongolia by now.

41
00:05:40,298 --> 00:05:41,716
Why didn't I think of that?

42
00:05:43,134 --> 00:05:45,470
She only needs to be alive
somewhere in this world.

43
00:05:46,846 --> 00:05:48,139
That's all I'm asking for.

44
00:05:49,432 --> 00:05:52,268
If it can lead to finding my daughter,

45
00:05:53,311 --> 00:05:56,856
I'd gladly give up all I have,
down to my organs.

46
00:05:57,482 --> 00:06:01,235
I'd even give my soul
to whoever finds her.

47
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:02,820
If only that could be me.

48
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:06,616
You're dismissed.

49
00:06:08,326 --> 00:06:09,327
Yes, ma'am.

50
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:16,834
Nam-soon.

51
00:06:17,668 --> 00:06:21,089
We will now take a photo
of this year's winner, Tsetseg.

52
00:06:21,672 --> 00:06:23,049
Please look this way.

53
00:06:24,008 --> 00:06:25,927
One, two, three.

54
00:06:29,514 --> 00:06:32,266
She has a genetic trait
that makes her extremely strong?

55
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:34,977
That's how her family is.

56
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:36,395
It's passed down among women.

57
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:37,814
Just how strong is she?

58
00:06:38,689 --> 00:06:39,899
Her strength is immeasurable.

59
00:06:39,982 --> 00:06:43,152
There's no knowing what'll happen
if one tries to measure it.

60
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:45,363
All the women in her family

61
00:06:45,446 --> 00:06:48,241
have incredible strength
like you've never seen before.

62
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:04,048
I present you with an heirloom
that has been passed down for generations.

63
00:07:04,132 --> 00:07:08,469
It is the polearm that my ancestor wielded

64
00:07:08,553 --> 00:07:10,346
while sparring with Admiral Yi Sun-sin.

65
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:13,599
Yi Sun-sin?

66
00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:17,145
During the exam he took
to become a military official,

67
00:07:17,228 --> 00:07:20,064
he sparred with my ancestor.

68
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:22,525
However,

69
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:25,903
Admiral Yi Sun-sin came out as the victor.

70
00:07:25,987 --> 00:07:27,029
Of course.

71
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:30,283
The sly Admiral Yi Sun-sin
chose to wield a wooden sword

72
00:07:30,366 --> 00:07:31,325
while my ancestor

73
00:07:32,243 --> 00:07:33,870
fought with this polearm

74
00:07:34,662 --> 00:07:36,414
made of steel.

75
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:40,168
Because wood is light,
you can create a longer blade.

76
00:07:40,251 --> 00:07:41,627
But with steel…

77
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:44,380
you can't because it'd be too heavy.

78
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:45,298
In the end,

79
00:07:45,923 --> 00:07:48,509
not being smart enough

80
00:07:48,593 --> 00:07:50,928
cost my ancestor
the fight with sly Yi Sun-sin.

81
00:07:57,602 --> 00:08:01,522
In other words, the polearm
didn't belong to Yi Sun-sin himself.

82
00:08:01,606 --> 00:08:02,648
That's true.

83
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:05,943
Do you have any proof,
whether official or unofficial,

84
00:08:06,027 --> 00:08:07,653
to show that they sparred?

85
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:10,198
-You don't, do you?
-No, I do not.

86
00:08:10,281 --> 00:08:11,282
So?

87
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:13,075
You must

88
00:08:13,951 --> 00:08:16,537
give me your utmost trust.

89
00:08:18,664 --> 00:08:20,708
Look into my eyes.

90
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:23,544
Can't you sense the truth behind them?

91
00:08:26,464 --> 00:08:27,548
Save it.

92
00:08:28,424 --> 00:08:30,927
Anyway, you're claiming
this is from the Joseon Dynasty.

93
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:34,889
An expert appraiser
comes by my pawnshop every Wednesday.

94
00:08:37,099 --> 00:08:38,684
Leave the item here.

95
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:40,937
We'll talk again after its appraisal.

96
00:08:44,106 --> 00:08:45,358
Please!

97
00:08:45,441 --> 00:08:46,651
I desperately need cash.

98
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:49,904
My wife's having her surgery tomorrow.

99
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:53,407
Could I get at least
five million won for now?

100
00:08:53,491 --> 00:08:55,451
Please. My poor wife!

101
00:09:15,304 --> 00:09:16,681
Take the polearm with you

102
00:09:16,764 --> 00:09:17,890
and bring it back on Wednesday.

103
00:09:23,271 --> 00:09:24,522
Open the safe.

104
00:09:24,605 --> 00:09:26,148
Open up the safe right now!

105
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:28,568
If you don't want to die, that is.

106
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:31,821
I bet you made up that story
about Admiral Yi Sun-sin.

107
00:09:31,904 --> 00:09:34,407
Did you think it was true, dumbass?

108
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:35,908
What? "Dumbass"?

109
00:09:35,992 --> 00:09:37,243
What did you just call me?

110
00:09:37,326 --> 00:09:38,327
A dumbass?

111
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:41,622
You should be on your knees
for the advance I gave you…

112
00:09:43,124 --> 00:09:44,500
That hurts!

113
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:46,502
How dare you call me a dumbass?

114
00:09:48,462 --> 00:09:51,090
Back in third grade,
a classmate called me a dumbass

115
00:09:51,173 --> 00:09:53,718
for not being able to memorize
the times tables.

116
00:09:53,801 --> 00:09:55,595
That brat's name was Heo Tae-yeong.

117
00:09:55,678 --> 00:09:57,847
Ever since then,
I've loathed anyone with that surname.

118
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:17,199
Meanwhile, your issue is
this mouth that spits lies.

119
00:10:22,204 --> 00:10:25,416
The same goes for this brain
that cooked up a story about Yi Sun-sin.

120
00:10:33,507 --> 00:10:34,425
What's wrong?

121
00:10:35,176 --> 00:10:36,344
Is your foot stuck?

122
00:10:43,851 --> 00:10:47,355
Where do I send you first?
The hospital or the police station?

123
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:49,732
The dentist.

124
00:10:51,025 --> 00:10:52,068
Why you…

125
00:10:57,198 --> 00:10:58,532
Aren't you forgetting something?

126
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:03,162
Take him with you, you douchebag.

127
00:11:06,207 --> 00:11:09,835
The women in her family
are born with supernatural strength.

128
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:12,963
It has been passed down
for over 500 years.

129
00:11:13,464 --> 00:11:15,216
They now presume

130
00:11:15,299 --> 00:11:19,804
that the superpower
comes from an X chromosome anomaly.

131
00:11:24,016 --> 00:11:27,561
So how did you end up marrying Ms. Hwang?

132
00:11:37,738 --> 00:11:38,823
Back then,

133
00:11:40,282 --> 00:11:43,411
she ran a hangover soup restaurant,
not a pawnshop.

134
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,121
HWANG GEUM-JU'S SEONJI HANGOVER SOUP

135
00:11:46,664 --> 00:11:47,873
Gather around.

136
00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:49,583
One, two,

137
00:11:49,667 --> 00:11:51,377
three, four…

138
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:52,294
Listen up.

139
00:11:53,295 --> 00:11:56,340
Use this money
to keep taking cabs until 3 p.m.

140
00:11:56,924 --> 00:12:00,386
Make sure to get off
before the meter hits 4,000 won.

141
00:12:00,469 --> 00:12:02,847
The number of rides
will determine your daily wage.

142
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:05,099
Keep telling the cab driver

143
00:12:05,182 --> 00:12:07,977
that this restaurant serves
the tastiest hangover soup.

144
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:11,063
-Go, Hwang Geum-ju's Seonji Hangover Soup!
-Go, Hwang Geum-ju's Seonji Hangover Soup!

145
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:12,106
Go.

146
00:12:13,691 --> 00:12:16,652
She has the ability to detect
what will rake in money.

147
00:12:16,735 --> 00:12:20,573
Every business she opens
becomes a gold mine.

148
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:25,578
I was a bank teller at the time.

149
00:12:25,661 --> 00:12:28,706
My job was to collect
the daily cash generated

150
00:12:28,789 --> 00:12:32,334
at Hwang Geum-ju's Seonji Hangover Soup.

151
00:12:35,838 --> 00:12:36,714
Bong-go.

152
00:12:36,797 --> 00:12:38,549
I've always wondered.

153
00:12:38,632 --> 00:12:40,217
Which is it that you loved,

154
00:12:41,719 --> 00:12:43,971
money or my big sister?

155
00:12:45,181 --> 00:12:46,557
Back then,

156
00:12:47,224 --> 00:12:50,436
my dream was to travel and take photos.

157
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:53,230
I was sick and tired of my job.

158
00:12:53,314 --> 00:12:55,608
The smell of money disgusted me.

159
00:12:58,819 --> 00:12:59,862
And that's when…

160
00:13:25,429 --> 00:13:27,139
Marry me.

161
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:36,190
I must

162
00:13:36,774 --> 00:13:37,942
give birth to a girl.

163
00:13:39,527 --> 00:13:41,153
I have a bloodline to continue.

164
00:13:41,904 --> 00:13:43,447
You need to put in the work.

165
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:44,782
I will.

166
00:13:44,865 --> 00:13:46,158
That being said,

167
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:50,454
why not quit your job
and be a stay-at-home dad?

168
00:13:50,538 --> 00:13:51,539
Oh, my.

169
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:56,669
Be a househusband
and let me provide for you.

170
00:13:56,752 --> 00:13:58,212
I'll give you the good life.

171
00:13:58,295 --> 00:14:02,174
I won't make false promises
about treating you like a princess.

172
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:03,092
Still,

173
00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:06,387
I will never do anything
that'll wring tears from your eyes.

174
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:09,848
Your dream is to be a photographer, right?

175
00:14:10,933 --> 00:14:13,269
I'll support you in fulfilling that dream.

176
00:14:14,895 --> 00:14:16,313
My dear Bong-go,

177
00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:18,065
you take the snaps

178
00:14:18,148 --> 00:14:20,109
and I'll make the stacks.

179
00:14:20,192 --> 00:14:21,443
Geum-ju!

180
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:30,119
Tonight,

181
00:14:30,995 --> 00:14:32,162
I'm not letting you

182
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:34,540
go home.

183
00:15:01,817 --> 00:15:03,444
The bed's in an odd place.

184
00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:21,629
This isn't ideal either.

185
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:33,432
This is the spot.

186
00:15:34,558 --> 00:15:35,935
It's more balanced.

187
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:41,398
I must've startled you.

188
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:44,944
There's something
you need to know about me.

189
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:46,946
I'm…

190
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:48,989
quite strong.

191
00:15:51,075 --> 00:15:52,576
It runs in the family.

192
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,244
Let me…

193
00:15:54,995 --> 00:15:56,330
take charge tonight.

194
00:15:59,249 --> 00:16:02,086
The women in this family
seem to run wild at the age of 22.

195
00:16:02,169 --> 00:16:03,545
They can't contain themselves.

196
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:05,965
Maybe it's a trait
all the women in her family have.

197
00:16:06,757 --> 00:16:08,592
Anyway, I got caught up in her ways

198
00:16:08,676 --> 00:16:13,347
and gave her a son as well as a daughter.

199
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:15,891
And for giving her a daughter,

200
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:19,228
she showed her appreciation
by getting me a designer watch.

201
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:21,188
Now for the highlight of the party.

202
00:16:21,271 --> 00:16:23,232
It's time for the doljabi ceremony.

203
00:16:23,315 --> 00:16:24,233
HAPPY FIRST BIRTHDAY

204
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:27,277
Nam-in will choose his object first.

205
00:16:27,361 --> 00:16:28,612
Nam-in, go ahead.

206
00:16:28,696 --> 00:16:31,240
-Go on.
-What will Nam-in choose?

207
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:34,159
He chose the rice cake.
Give it up for Nam-in!

208
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:38,330
Next up is Nam-soon.

209
00:16:38,914 --> 00:16:41,041
Which object will Nam-soon choose?

210
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:05,607
Guys, look this way. And go!

211
00:17:17,786 --> 00:17:18,954
That's really high.

212
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:25,836
Nam-soon wasn't just my daughter.

213
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:27,546
She was also my muse.

214
00:17:27,629 --> 00:17:30,340
That's why I took her to Mongolia

215
00:17:30,424 --> 00:17:32,301
when I went there
to take photos of the stars.

216
00:17:36,764 --> 00:17:41,685
I wanted to capture
some special moments with her.

217
00:17:43,645 --> 00:17:44,688
But then…

218
00:17:45,272 --> 00:17:48,150
Nam-soon!

219
00:17:48,233 --> 00:17:50,486
Nam-soon!

220
00:17:51,028 --> 00:17:53,030
Nam-soon!

221
00:17:53,989 --> 00:17:57,284
Nam-soon!

222
00:17:59,203 --> 00:18:00,454
And just like that,

223
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:03,582
-I lost Nam-soon.
-Nam-soon!

224
00:18:03,665 --> 00:18:07,044
Was that the event
that triggered your divorce

225
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:09,379
from Ms. Hwang?

226
00:18:13,884 --> 00:18:17,805
There was no other way
to make up for my wrongdoing.

227
00:18:19,139 --> 00:18:22,351
Where on earth could Nam-soon be?

228
00:18:23,393 --> 00:18:26,939
Does she even remember
that Nam-soon is her name?

229
00:18:30,651 --> 00:18:31,693
Mom, Dad.

230
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:36,615
The invincible giant Tsetseg!

231
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:41,620
Our daughter sure is strong.

232
00:18:41,703 --> 00:18:44,081
Mom, Dad, why am I so strong?

233
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:47,000
We don't know.

234
00:18:47,084 --> 00:18:49,336
We couldn't find out where you came from.

235
00:18:49,419 --> 00:18:52,923
I want to know who I am
and where I'm from.

236
00:18:55,175 --> 00:18:58,804
You were riding Ppappa
when we first saw you.

237
00:18:58,887 --> 00:19:01,932
You couldn't have been
more than five or six years old.

238
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:07,396
A horse is coming this way.

239
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:10,524
Honey, take a better look.

240
00:19:11,942 --> 00:19:14,236
A young child is on its back.

241
00:19:15,779 --> 00:19:17,030
It's a little girl.

242
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:20,868
They're coming toward us.

243
00:19:21,952 --> 00:19:23,203
And she's crying.

244
00:19:26,748 --> 00:19:27,958
I'll go and take a look.

245
00:19:47,102 --> 00:19:49,021
Papa.

246
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:51,148
Papa.

247
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:54,359
Papa.

248
00:19:58,155 --> 00:19:59,448
Papa…

249
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:00,824
What's wrong, little one?

250
00:20:00,908 --> 00:20:02,576
"Ppappa"? What does she mean?

251
00:20:02,659 --> 00:20:04,661
Is that the horse's name?

252
00:20:04,745 --> 00:20:06,955
-Look how pretty she is.
-Papa.

253
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:09,124
-It's fate.
-Papa.

254
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:11,710
This girl must be a gift from above.

255
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:19,384
This is what you were wearing
when you first came to us.

256
00:20:38,278 --> 00:20:40,739
MADE IN KOREA

257
00:20:42,491 --> 00:20:44,368
THEY GIVE UP HIDING IN THE WASHING MACHINE

258
00:20:50,332 --> 00:20:51,375
Get it some other time.

259
00:20:52,376 --> 00:20:53,710
That's how it's usually done.

260
00:20:54,628 --> 00:20:56,255
Hey, don't come out.

261
00:20:56,838 --> 00:20:59,216
Hold on a second. I have something to say.

262
00:20:59,299 --> 00:21:01,009
Wait. Don't come out!

263
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:04,221
How is it that those Korean men
look so pretty like flowers?

264
00:21:04,805 --> 00:21:08,976
They make me want to protect them.
Korean men are my type.

265
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:16,525
I'm Gangnam style

266
00:21:18,986 --> 00:21:20,028
Gangnam style

267
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:23,699
-I'm Gangnam style
-Style

268
00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:25,450
I'm Gangnam style

269
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:28,203
-Gangnam style…
-I'm Gangnam style

270
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:30,956
-Gang Nam-soon!
-Nam-soon!

271
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:33,208
Gang Nam-soon!

272
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:37,004
Nam-soon!

273
00:22:08,577 --> 00:22:09,703
Gang Nam-soon.

274
00:22:15,083 --> 00:22:17,627
I'm sure I'm from Korea.

275
00:22:17,711 --> 00:22:19,129
My name is Gang Nam-soon.

276
00:22:19,963 --> 00:22:21,340
I have to go to Korea.

277
00:22:21,423 --> 00:22:22,257
To Korea?

278
00:22:25,677 --> 00:22:26,636
Don't worry though.

279
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,388
I'm not leaving right away.

280
00:22:28,472 --> 00:22:30,849
If I leave now,
it will make it hard on the family.

281
00:22:31,475 --> 00:22:33,769
I'll shepherd more sheep
so I can earn money

282
00:22:33,852 --> 00:22:35,437
and learn Korean first.

283
00:22:37,606 --> 00:22:39,232
Giyeok.

284
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:42,360
Nieun.

285
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:43,820
Ga.

286
00:22:44,321 --> 00:22:45,322
Na.

287
00:22:45,405 --> 00:22:48,033
Da, ra, ma, ba, sa,

288
00:22:48,116 --> 00:22:50,410
ah, ja, cha, ka, ta, pa, ha.

289
00:22:50,494 --> 00:22:52,412
-Ga, na, da, ra, ma, ba, sa
-Ga, na, da, ra, ma, ba, sa

290
00:22:52,496 --> 00:22:54,247
-Ah, ja, cha, ka, ta, pa, ha
-Ah, ja, cha, ka, ta, pa, ha

291
00:22:58,126 --> 00:23:01,713
-There is so much I wish to say
-There is so much I wish to say

292
00:23:02,339 --> 00:23:06,676
-But the song is too short
-But the song is too short

293
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,303
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven…

294
00:23:08,386 --> 00:23:09,554
Nam-soon.

295
00:23:12,015 --> 00:23:13,391
I hope you're safe and well.

296
00:24:39,477 --> 00:24:40,437
Hey, Dad.

297
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:42,147
You're all grown up now.

298
00:24:43,648 --> 00:24:45,275
It's time you went to Korea.

299
00:24:46,568 --> 00:24:49,529
Head to Korea before it's too late.

300
00:24:51,114 --> 00:24:54,034
I'm worried about
leaving you and Mom behind.

301
00:24:54,117 --> 00:24:57,370
Don't worry about us.
Just get married first.

302
00:24:57,454 --> 00:25:00,290
Then leave with your husband.
That way, I'll worry less.

303
00:25:00,373 --> 00:25:01,458
Dad.

304
00:25:02,209 --> 00:25:03,710
I'm going to marry a Korean man.

305
00:25:06,421 --> 00:25:10,884
So you'll find both your roots
and your other half there?

306
00:25:13,845 --> 00:25:14,679
That's right.

307
00:25:14,763 --> 00:25:17,599
I'm going to find
the purest man in the world.

308
00:25:18,183 --> 00:25:21,436
A man I wish to protect.
I will find him no matter what…

309
00:25:22,062 --> 00:25:24,231
-in Korea.
-In Korea.

310
00:25:26,524 --> 00:25:27,359
And now,

311
00:25:27,442 --> 00:25:32,113
we'll commence the final event
for the Tenth Annual Strength Contest.

312
00:25:34,157 --> 00:25:35,533
Stage One! Ready!

313
00:25:41,456 --> 00:25:42,540
Three,

314
00:25:43,124 --> 00:25:44,960
two, one.

315
00:25:45,043 --> 00:25:45,919
Very good.

316
00:25:46,002 --> 00:25:47,796
Stage Two! Ready!

317
00:25:49,631 --> 00:25:50,507
Three,

318
00:25:51,091 --> 00:25:53,093
two, one.

319
00:25:55,011 --> 00:25:57,514
Lastly, Stage Three! Ready!

320
00:26:01,851 --> 00:26:04,312
Five, four,

321
00:26:05,021 --> 00:26:08,275
three, two, one.

322
00:26:08,358 --> 00:26:09,567
No!

323
00:26:09,651 --> 00:26:11,653
Congratulations to
contestant number seven!

324
00:26:13,947 --> 00:26:15,115
Nam-soon.

325
00:26:15,198 --> 00:26:16,574
How impressive was that?

326
00:26:16,658 --> 00:26:18,994
This is the first time
in the ten-year history of this contest

327
00:26:19,077 --> 00:26:21,746
that a contestant managed
to carry a weight of 120 kg!

328
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:24,040
-Do you think she's your daughter?
-No.

329
00:26:24,666 --> 00:26:25,917
What makes you so sure?

330
00:26:26,001 --> 00:26:27,127
I just know.

331
00:26:27,711 --> 00:26:29,004
I'd recognize her in a heartbeat.

JUDGES

333
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:55,238
I'm from Yanbian.

334
00:26:55,322 --> 00:26:57,532
What is your name?

335
00:26:58,658 --> 00:26:59,993
It's Ri Hwa-ja.

336
00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:02,037
Hwa-ja?

337
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:04,831
How about we talk in private?

338
00:27:04,914 --> 00:27:06,166
So…

339
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,502
will I receive the prize money
for winning the contest?

340
00:27:11,254 --> 00:27:12,714
Of course.

THE SEARCH
FOR THE STRONGEST WOMAN ON EARTH

342
00:27:18,345 --> 00:27:19,512
1ST PLACE: 500 MILLION WON

343
00:27:35,403 --> 00:27:36,446
Hwa-ja.

344
00:27:37,655 --> 00:27:39,157
What's your blood type?

345
00:27:40,158 --> 00:27:41,326
It's type B.

346
00:27:43,286 --> 00:27:44,371
That's right.

347
00:27:45,372 --> 00:27:48,416
I'm type B and Mr. Gang is type O.

348
00:27:49,334 --> 00:27:52,754
When did you move to Yanbian?

349
00:27:53,421 --> 00:27:55,507
I came on a boat from Mongolia

350
00:27:56,257 --> 00:27:57,842
when I was five.

351
00:27:58,802 --> 00:28:00,303
So you were five years old

352
00:28:00,387 --> 00:28:02,639
when you were brought
to Yanbian from Mongolia?

353
00:28:02,722 --> 00:28:03,848
That's right.

354
00:28:07,018 --> 00:28:09,479
Where have you been living
all these years?

355
00:28:10,105 --> 00:28:13,358
I stayed at an orphanage until 16

356
00:28:13,441 --> 00:28:15,777
and have been living alone since.

357
00:28:19,447 --> 00:28:22,117
What do you do for a living?

358
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:26,079
I didn't have much of an education
and all I had was my strength,

359
00:28:26,162 --> 00:28:29,040
so I worked as a laborer
at construction sites in Yanbian.

360
00:28:29,624 --> 00:28:32,085
You've been working in manual labor?

361
00:28:32,669 --> 00:28:33,753
Yes, that's right.

362
00:28:37,674 --> 00:28:38,550
But…

363
00:28:39,926 --> 00:28:41,469
it seems I'm the only one eating.

364
00:28:42,303 --> 00:28:43,638
The food's delicious.

365
00:28:44,222 --> 00:28:46,391
I feel bad eating by myself.

366
00:28:46,474 --> 00:28:47,642
Here.

367
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:49,853
Please have some,

368
00:28:51,646 --> 00:28:52,981
Mother.

369
00:28:57,527 --> 00:28:58,570
Hwa-ja.

370
00:28:59,195 --> 00:29:01,281
I mean, Nam-soon.

371
00:29:04,784 --> 00:29:05,827
How old…

372
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:08,997
are you now?

373
00:29:10,373 --> 00:29:11,875
I'm 22.

374
00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:15,962
Eat up.

375
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:32,395
It's me.

376
00:29:33,188 --> 00:29:34,939
Come to Sanctus right away.

377
00:29:36,733 --> 00:29:37,817
Mr. Gang,

378
00:29:39,027 --> 00:29:40,069
I think…

379
00:29:40,945 --> 00:29:42,071
we found our daughter.

380
00:29:44,491 --> 00:29:46,451
Bring Nam-in, my mom,
and Geum-dong as well.

381
00:29:47,368 --> 00:29:48,912
We all have to eat dinner anyway.

382
00:29:52,957 --> 00:29:55,460
Did they really find their daughter?

383
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:57,587
The blood type's a match,

384
00:29:57,670 --> 00:29:59,589
but Mr. Gang isn't convinced.

385
00:29:59,672 --> 00:30:02,467
A DNA test will quickly give them answers.

386
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:06,179
Because of the X chromosome anomaly
that runs in the women of that family,

387
00:30:06,262 --> 00:30:08,264
DNA tests never yield accurate results.

388
00:30:08,932 --> 00:30:10,850
A test is virtually impossible.

389
00:30:11,976 --> 00:30:13,102
How peculiar.

390
00:30:13,978 --> 00:30:16,731
Who knew such a bloodline existed?

391
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:20,068
I truly hope they find their daughter.

392
00:30:20,151 --> 00:30:21,402
I'm exhausted as it is.

393
00:30:22,278 --> 00:30:24,697
Thanks to the decade-old Strength Contest,

394
00:30:24,781 --> 00:30:28,034
the whole world knows
about the search for Gang Nam-soon.

395
00:30:29,244 --> 00:30:32,372
But the fact she hasn't shown up yet
makes it pretty obvious.

396
00:30:33,248 --> 00:30:34,791
She must be dead.

397
00:30:36,334 --> 00:30:37,377
You know,

398
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:41,756
that girl today was super strong.

399
00:30:42,715 --> 00:30:45,510
She held 120 kg worth of sandbags
on her two arms

400
00:30:45,593 --> 00:30:46,886
and stood strong.

401
00:30:48,471 --> 00:30:52,892
Could that girl from Yanbian
really be Gang Nam-soon?

402
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:55,436
She could be.

403
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:59,858
Just how strong
are the women in this family?

404
00:30:59,941 --> 00:31:01,484
It's never been revealed.

405
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:04,362
They don't want it published on paper.

406
00:31:10,118 --> 00:31:12,245
LET'S MEET SOMEDAY

407
00:31:13,329 --> 00:31:17,125
What should I do if boys fight over me?

408
00:31:18,251 --> 00:31:19,544
I don't want a war, you know.

409
00:31:29,512 --> 00:31:30,346
Ppappa.

410
00:31:31,681 --> 00:31:32,640
Ppappa.

411
00:31:45,361 --> 00:31:47,488
You two are a couple, aren't you?

412
00:31:48,573 --> 00:31:50,366
Let's go. It's time for dinner.

413
00:32:13,556 --> 00:32:14,557
Let's eat.

414
00:32:15,058 --> 00:32:16,142
Here you go.

415
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:17,769
Thanks.

416
00:32:17,852 --> 00:32:18,770
Geum-dong,

417
00:32:19,479 --> 00:32:20,521
shall I cut it for you?

418
00:32:20,605 --> 00:32:22,357
I don't have the strength for this.

419
00:32:28,905 --> 00:32:29,864
Here.

420
00:32:44,253 --> 00:32:45,463
It's this way.

421
00:32:59,268 --> 00:33:00,186
This is your room.

422
00:33:36,139 --> 00:33:39,142
So do you really think she's Nam-soon?

423
00:33:39,225 --> 00:33:40,184
I'm sure of it.

424
00:33:40,268 --> 00:33:41,269
She's Nam-soon.

425
00:33:41,936 --> 00:33:44,397
Hey, do some more digging!

426
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,858
Nam-soon's characteristics

427
00:33:46,941 --> 00:33:50,987
and how you lost her
were run in newspapers for ten years.

428
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:52,447
Remember what lengths you went to

429
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:54,490
when they said
they'd stop writing about her?

430
00:33:54,574 --> 00:33:56,784
You bought the newspaper.

431
00:33:56,868 --> 00:33:57,952
HAVE YOU SEEN OUR DAUGHTER?

432
00:33:58,036 --> 00:33:59,662
Anyone could fabricate a backstory

433
00:33:59,746 --> 00:34:02,707
based on the information
found in those newspapers.

434
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:04,584
How would you explain her strength?

435
00:34:04,667 --> 00:34:07,211
Only a woman of our bloodline
could be that strong.

436
00:34:07,295 --> 00:34:09,964
What she showcased
wasn't conclusive enough.

437
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:11,132
Maybe arm-wrestling with Mom--

438
00:34:11,215 --> 00:34:12,842
Her age and blood type are the same.

439
00:34:13,426 --> 00:34:15,720
Is it a coincidence
she moved from Mongolia to Yanbian

440
00:34:15,803 --> 00:34:16,763
at the age of five?

441
00:34:16,846 --> 00:34:18,639
There's a small scar

442
00:34:18,723 --> 00:34:19,974
on the sole of Nam-soon's foot.

443
00:34:21,809 --> 00:34:24,103
When she was four,
she jumped off the rooftop

444
00:34:24,187 --> 00:34:25,772
and injured her foot on a branch.

445
00:34:25,855 --> 00:34:29,525
I told you countless times
to watch over the kids at home.

446
00:34:30,902 --> 00:34:32,487
Why did you let her get hurt?

447
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:35,990
I didn't say anything
because I knew you'd react this way.

448
00:34:36,574 --> 00:34:38,951
It makes sense.
Nam-soon loved being high up.

449
00:34:39,494 --> 00:34:41,329
That's why she often jumped from rooftops.

450
00:34:41,412 --> 00:34:42,789
She was like that. He's right.

451
00:34:44,207 --> 00:34:45,708
Why didn't you tell me?

452
00:34:46,709 --> 00:34:48,086
Our daughter was badly hurt.

453
00:34:48,169 --> 00:34:49,128
What was the point?

454
00:34:49,212 --> 00:34:50,880
You were busy making money,

455
00:34:50,963 --> 00:34:53,257
and I had to do all the housework
and look after the kids.

456
00:34:53,341 --> 00:34:54,634
What difference would that have made?

457
00:34:54,717 --> 00:34:55,843
My point exactly!

458
00:34:55,927 --> 00:34:58,346
What was so hard
about looking after two kids at home?

459
00:34:59,472 --> 00:35:01,265
I'll say it since we're on the subject.

460
00:35:01,349 --> 00:35:05,937
I told you not to take
Nam-soon to Mongolia!

461
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:07,855
Why did you take her there?

462
00:35:07,939 --> 00:35:10,691
Both Nam-soon and Nam-in
needed me by their sides.

463
00:35:10,775 --> 00:35:12,485
It's not like
you ever spent time with them.

464
00:35:12,568 --> 00:35:14,946
Did you know that Nam-soon
eats the tops of strawberries?

465
00:35:15,029 --> 00:35:17,031
Are you aware that Nam-in
is addicted to carbs?

466
00:35:18,407 --> 00:35:20,201
Bong-go, only a fool would miss that.

467
00:35:20,284 --> 00:35:23,788
Why do you think
he stuffs himself like a pig?

468
00:35:23,871 --> 00:35:25,081
He lacks motherly love.

469
00:35:25,164 --> 00:35:26,707
He craves affection.

470
00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:29,085
He figured being fat
would generate some attention.

471
00:35:29,168 --> 00:35:30,253
Dad!

472
00:35:30,336 --> 00:35:32,296
How could you? I'm right here, you know.

473
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:33,673
Nam-soon went missing!

474
00:35:33,756 --> 00:35:35,466
Of course I wasn't in my right mind.

475
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:38,719
Still, feeding him nonstop
is what made him this way.

476
00:35:38,803 --> 00:35:39,804
This is on you, Mom.

477
00:35:39,887 --> 00:35:41,764
Fine, I'm sorry. I fed him too much.

478
00:35:41,848 --> 00:35:44,517
Why am I suddenly
the focus of this conversation?

479
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:46,185
It's making me uncomfortable.

480
00:35:46,269 --> 00:35:47,103
Enough!

481
00:35:47,186 --> 00:35:48,563
It's irreversible now!

482
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:54,110
Whether that girl is Nam-soon or not
should be our priority.

483
00:35:54,193 --> 00:35:56,070
That's what matters now, all right?

484
00:35:56,154 --> 00:35:57,363
Now, sit!

485
00:35:58,364 --> 00:35:59,198
You too.

486
00:36:00,032 --> 00:36:01,576
Gosh, all that yelling.

487
00:36:01,659 --> 00:36:03,744
-My head's spinning.
-She isn't Nam-soon.

488
00:36:04,537 --> 00:36:07,373
How can you be so adamant
that she isn't Nam-soon?

489
00:36:07,456 --> 00:36:08,708
Call it my sharp intuition.

490
00:36:08,791 --> 00:36:10,501
Sharp, my foot.

491
00:36:10,585 --> 00:36:12,920
She doesn't look anything
like Nam-soon as a kid.

492
00:36:13,004 --> 00:36:13,921
She's had it rough!

493
00:36:15,339 --> 00:36:16,174
The poor girl.

494
00:36:16,257 --> 00:36:17,383
Nam-soon has clear eyes.

495
00:36:17,466 --> 00:36:18,885
She gets her beautiful eyes from you.

496
00:36:25,016 --> 00:36:26,017
Ex-brother-in-law,

497
00:36:26,601 --> 00:36:28,936
are you still in love with Geum-ju?

498
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:30,021
-As if!
-As if!

499
00:36:30,104 --> 00:36:31,522
As if.

500
00:36:31,606 --> 00:36:32,565
Whatever.

501
00:36:33,566 --> 00:36:34,859
Anyway,

502
00:36:34,942 --> 00:36:37,403
I'm accepting her as Nam-soon,

503
00:36:39,071 --> 00:36:40,406
so that's that.

504
00:36:48,247 --> 00:36:49,248
Hi,

505
00:36:49,332 --> 00:36:52,668
my name is Gang Nam-soon.

506
00:36:52,752 --> 00:36:54,503
Gang Nam-soon.

507
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:08,017
Where on earth is Gangnam, though?

508
00:37:39,632 --> 00:37:40,925
It's not too late.

509
00:37:42,218 --> 00:37:43,219
It's not too late…

510
00:37:44,387 --> 00:37:45,596
to make things right.

511
00:38:26,512 --> 00:38:27,555
I can't believe it.

512
00:38:29,181 --> 00:38:30,558
She's Nam-soon.

513
00:38:31,726 --> 00:38:32,768
She's my daughter Nam-soon.

514
00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:35,271
Nam-soon.

515
00:38:38,649 --> 00:38:39,692
Mother?

516
00:38:40,484 --> 00:38:43,571
Nam-soon.

517
00:38:44,238 --> 00:38:45,156
Nam-soon!

518
00:39:11,724 --> 00:39:12,892
Let's eat.

519
00:39:45,925 --> 00:39:49,512
The sound of both of my kids eating

520
00:39:49,595 --> 00:39:50,888
is music to my ears.

521
00:40:01,482 --> 00:40:02,316
Khorkhog?

522
00:40:03,109 --> 00:40:05,403
Gosh, it's khorkhog. What's the occasion?

523
00:40:05,486 --> 00:40:08,239
We sold all our sheep today.

524
00:40:08,906 --> 00:40:12,159
Today's your last day in Mongolia.

525
00:40:30,636 --> 00:40:31,762
Ppappa.

526
00:40:37,143 --> 00:40:38,227
Ppappa?

527
00:40:50,614 --> 00:40:51,532
Ppappa…

528
00:40:53,242 --> 00:40:54,326
Ppappa?

529
00:41:00,833 --> 00:41:02,001
Ppappa.

530
00:41:14,388 --> 00:41:16,932
It's time to bid Ppappa farewell.

531
00:41:17,558 --> 00:41:20,186
Ppappa waited
until you were leaving for Korea.

532
00:41:28,402 --> 00:41:29,445
Ppappa.

533
00:41:34,825 --> 00:41:35,826
Ppappa.

534
00:41:54,678 --> 00:41:56,639
Ppappa…

535
00:43:07,376 --> 00:43:09,211
GANGHAN POLICE PRECINCT

536
00:43:47,249 --> 00:43:52,463
We will always be here, praying for you.

537
00:43:56,008 --> 00:44:00,304
If things get tough,
come back home at any time.

538
00:44:07,102 --> 00:44:08,145
Mom.

539
00:44:08,687 --> 00:44:11,315
This will help locate your birth mother.

540
00:44:21,325 --> 00:44:22,368
How do you feel?

541
00:44:26,455 --> 00:44:28,082
Please make her as pretty as you can.

542
00:44:42,221 --> 00:44:43,430
Shall we try that place?

543
00:44:46,392 --> 00:44:47,685
So tiny and cute.

544
00:44:49,937 --> 00:44:51,146
Maybe the pink one?

545
00:44:56,318 --> 00:44:57,277
Nam-soon.

546
00:44:58,570 --> 00:45:00,739
Live your life however you want now

547
00:45:00,823 --> 00:45:02,157
because this is all yours.

548
00:45:04,535 --> 00:45:05,452
Let's go.

549
00:45:13,961 --> 00:45:15,754
Haven't I made myself clear to you?

550
00:45:15,838 --> 00:45:17,464
It's just not possible.

551
00:45:17,548 --> 00:45:20,342
Please loan me the money
just one more time.

552
00:45:20,426 --> 00:45:22,136
We can't issue any more loans.

553
00:45:22,761 --> 00:45:25,013
You've already visited us
several times this week.

554
00:45:25,097 --> 00:45:27,975
Pay back your previous loan first,
and then we'll talk.

555
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:29,393
But…

556
00:45:33,564 --> 00:45:35,649
-Ms. Hwang.
-Ms. Park.

557
00:45:36,358 --> 00:45:38,277
Please lend me ten million won.

558
00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:42,114
I'll give you the rights
to my street food vendors.

559
00:45:44,992 --> 00:45:46,994
But how will you make a living
without your business?

560
00:45:48,579 --> 00:45:49,705
What's going on?

561
00:45:54,418 --> 00:45:56,462
-Lend her the money.
-But Ms. Hwang,

562
00:45:56,545 --> 00:45:59,923
she liquidated every asset of hers
during this past month.

563
00:46:00,007 --> 00:46:01,633
-So give her the money.
-Yes, ma'am.

564
00:47:21,755 --> 00:47:22,798
Here.

565
00:47:31,765 --> 00:47:33,058
Is this not the place?

566
00:48:30,949 --> 00:48:32,242
Please step out.

567
00:48:33,035 --> 00:48:35,662
Requesting seizure of a black sedan
with the plate number Seoul M3490.

568
00:49:47,526 --> 00:49:48,652
Who are you?

569
00:49:49,236 --> 00:49:50,070
A cop?

570
00:49:51,613 --> 00:49:52,447
As if.

571
00:49:59,955 --> 00:50:01,456
Who the heck is that lady?

572
00:50:30,694 --> 00:50:32,696
-Hey, Hee-sik!
-Welcome back.

573
00:50:32,779 --> 00:50:33,697
I'm back.

574
00:50:33,780 --> 00:50:35,657
Hwang Dae-cheol, Min Byeong-hun.

575
00:50:35,741 --> 00:50:36,700
My goodness.

576
00:50:39,578 --> 00:50:41,121
Good job, Hee-sik.

577
00:50:41,872 --> 00:50:43,665
-I'm not the one who caught them.
-Sir!

578
00:50:44,541 --> 00:50:47,085
We have intel of a mule on board
an 11 p.m. flight from Mongolia.

579
00:50:47,169 --> 00:50:48,587
They'll be landing soon.

580
00:50:48,670 --> 00:50:49,921
Contact the Incheon DIU.

581
00:50:50,005 --> 00:50:51,006
Got it.

582
00:50:51,089 --> 00:50:52,549
Young-tak and I will head to the airport.

583
00:50:52,632 --> 00:50:53,717
Okay, let's go.

584
00:50:54,885 --> 00:50:56,928
-We'll get going.
-Good luck.

585
00:51:28,752 --> 00:51:29,795
Hello.

586
00:51:39,095 --> 00:51:42,849
Please fasten your seat belts.

587
00:51:42,933 --> 00:51:45,560
Please fasten your seat belts.

588
00:51:53,485 --> 00:51:55,821
We can't be sure
how it's being transported.

589
00:51:55,904 --> 00:51:58,740
It could be in the form of a snack
or even a soft toy.

590
00:51:58,824 --> 00:52:00,575
Anything can be drugs in disguise.

591
00:52:00,659 --> 00:52:01,827
Plastic bottles, crayons,

592
00:52:01,910 --> 00:52:04,538
tissue, stationery, candies,
and other miscellaneous items,

593
00:52:04,621 --> 00:52:07,040
including makeup, should be inspected.

594
00:52:08,542 --> 00:52:09,626
Yes?

595
00:52:09,709 --> 00:52:10,710
Got it.

596
00:52:11,211 --> 00:52:12,629
They started the inspections.

597
00:52:47,122 --> 00:52:49,624
We promise you a safe flight.
Please enjoy your time.

598
00:52:49,708 --> 00:52:50,876
Is safety your priority?

599
00:52:51,626 --> 00:52:52,460
Sorry?

600
00:52:54,838 --> 00:52:56,214
I, for one, prefer speed.

601
00:53:16,026 --> 00:53:16,902
Hello, officers.

602
00:53:16,985 --> 00:53:17,986
Here you go.

603
00:53:19,905 --> 00:53:22,532
I'm Inspector Lee of the Incheon DIU.
The plane lands in five minutes.

604
00:53:22,616 --> 00:53:24,576
Got it. Five minutes.

605
00:53:25,702 --> 00:53:26,745
This is the control tower.

606
00:53:26,828 --> 00:53:28,997
An issue detected on
the Air Mong flight arriving at 10:45 p.m.

607
00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:31,458
The aircraft is about to land
but isn't slowing down.

608
00:54:14,042 --> 00:54:15,251
Nam-soon.

609
00:54:17,170 --> 00:54:19,798
You must be exhausted.
You should get some sleep.

610
00:54:20,382 --> 00:54:21,299
I'm fine.

611
00:54:23,468 --> 00:54:25,720
Is that me in those photos?

612
00:54:29,182 --> 00:54:30,100
Yes.

613
00:54:30,183 --> 00:54:31,893
It's definitely me.

614
00:54:31,977 --> 00:54:33,019
Really?

615
00:54:34,354 --> 00:54:36,022
Do you have any childhood photos?

616
00:54:37,857 --> 00:54:40,443
Not anymore.

617
00:54:40,527 --> 00:54:43,321
I only have them in my memories.

618
00:54:46,032 --> 00:54:47,742
You must not have a driver's license.

619
00:54:48,326 --> 00:54:49,619
Let's get you one.

620
00:54:49,703 --> 00:54:50,912
I'll buy you a car.

621
00:54:52,247 --> 00:54:54,374
As your mom,
I'll give you everything you want.

622
00:54:57,043 --> 00:54:58,420
But for now, let's get to bed.

623
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:06,845
I'm curious though.

624
00:55:08,388 --> 00:55:11,891
Just how strong was I as a kid?

625
00:55:14,561 --> 00:55:15,562
Come here.

626
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:20,567
For over 500 years,

627
00:55:20,650 --> 00:55:24,487
the women in our family have been born
with supernatural strength.

628
00:55:24,571 --> 00:55:27,240
Out of all of them,
you were the most unique.

629
00:55:28,992 --> 00:55:33,329
There's a good chance
you don't know your true potential.

630
00:55:33,997 --> 00:55:37,500
Just how strong was I?

631
00:55:39,419 --> 00:55:40,628
At the age of five,

632
00:55:41,838 --> 00:55:43,048
you flipped a car.

633
00:55:44,841 --> 00:55:46,509
But that wasn't all.

634
00:55:58,271 --> 00:55:59,272
Is everything all right?

635
00:56:34,766 --> 00:56:36,434
Not only were you strong,

636
00:56:37,018 --> 00:56:38,812
but also you had great speed
and jumping abilities.

637
00:58:10,528 --> 00:58:11,779
What just happened?

638
00:58:30,089 --> 00:58:31,090
My goodness.

639
00:59:04,249 --> 00:59:06,417
SPECIAL THANKS TO KIM WON-HAE

640
00:59:37,282 --> 00:59:39,617
STRONG GIRL NAM-SOON

641
00:59:39,701 --> 00:59:41,077
I'm here.

642
00:59:41,160 --> 00:59:43,246
Let's do this!

643
00:59:43,329 --> 00:59:45,123
-Are you Mongolian?
-I'm a Gangnam person.

644
00:59:45,206 --> 00:59:47,041
Either way, these will be confiscated.

645
00:59:47,125 --> 00:59:49,794
-Not this.
-That's up to us to decide.

646
00:59:49,877 --> 00:59:51,921
All con artists are nice to their marks.

647
00:59:52,005 --> 00:59:53,631
Are you saying I was conned?

648
00:59:53,715 --> 00:59:56,050
This isn't what I dreamed of.

649
00:59:56,134 --> 00:59:58,094
Have you eaten? I looked for you all day.

650
00:59:58,177 --> 01:00:00,471
My daughter is currently in Korea.

651
01:00:00,555 --> 01:00:03,308
She's somewhere close. I can feel it.

652
01:00:03,391 --> 01:00:04,684
Did you look into Hwa-ja?

653
01:00:04,767 --> 01:00:06,519
She seemed to be cooking something up.

654
01:00:06,603 --> 01:00:08,438
How should I deal with her?

655
01:00:08,521 --> 01:00:09,439
Observe quietly.

656
01:00:09,522 --> 01:00:11,566
Are you going to help me find my mom?

657
01:00:11,649 --> 01:00:12,734
I keep my promises.

658
01:00:12,817 --> 01:00:14,485
Could that cop's disguise be any lousier?

659
01:00:14,569 --> 01:00:16,321
I know. Blame our budget.

660
01:00:16,404 --> 01:00:17,739
Move your car!

661
01:00:17,822 --> 01:00:19,824
No way. You move your car instead!

662
01:00:19,907 --> 01:00:21,451
This won't end until we lock up

663
01:00:21,534 --> 01:00:22,744
those high up in the food chain.

664
01:00:22,827 --> 01:00:24,829
It becomes a new synthetic drug.

665
01:00:24,912 --> 01:00:27,165
Even 1 g of this will instantly kill you.

666
01:00:27,248 --> 01:00:29,042
I must protect it from crimes.

667
01:00:29,125 --> 01:00:32,670
Why are you taking it upon yourself
to disrupt the ecosystem?

668
01:00:32,754 --> 01:00:34,922
There's a lot in this world
that I must take care of.

669
01:00:35,006 --> 01:00:37,216
Go here if you wish to change the world.

670
01:00:37,300 --> 01:00:39,636
It only grants access to special people.

671
01:00:41,554 --> 01:00:46,559
