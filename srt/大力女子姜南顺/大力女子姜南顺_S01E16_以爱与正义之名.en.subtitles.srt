1
00:00:42,667 --> 00:00:45,962
STRONG GIRL NAM-SOON

2
00:00:47,297 --> 00:00:50,133
EPISODE 16
IN THE NAME OF LOVE AND JUSTICE

3
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:39,742
I created CTA4885.

4
00:02:40,952 --> 00:02:42,579
The amount you took

5
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,248
has rendered you helpless

6
00:02:46,374 --> 00:02:47,792
and unable to wield your strength.

7
00:03:11,065 --> 00:03:12,066
Farewell.

8
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:19,574
Things won't go your way.

9
00:03:20,241 --> 00:03:21,576
It's time to stop!

10
00:03:48,978 --> 00:03:50,647
It's over, Ryu Si-o.

11
00:03:51,689 --> 00:03:52,732
Hands up!

12
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:01,407
Nam-soon.

13
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:13,044
I'll get you the antidote.

14
00:04:13,127 --> 00:04:14,170
But first,

15
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:17,674
my Mongolian mom boarded her plane…

16
00:04:19,968 --> 00:04:21,302
carrying a bomb.

17
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:25,807
Nam-soon?

18
00:04:26,307 --> 00:04:28,017
P'way Air 803.

19
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:30,561
Cancel your departure
and evacuate the passengers.

20
00:04:30,645 --> 00:04:31,646
There's a bomb threat.

21
00:04:33,731 --> 00:04:34,649
Please be advised.

22
00:04:34,732 --> 00:04:36,025
Due to a bomb threat,

23
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:39,237
P'way Air 803 will be out of service.

24
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,864
Please leave your belongings behind

25
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:43,408
-and exit the plane.
-A bomb?

26
00:04:43,491 --> 00:04:45,576
Please leave your belongings
and exit the plane.

27
00:05:03,553 --> 00:05:05,096
We checked the passenger list.

28
00:05:05,179 --> 00:05:07,098
Do you know what the bomb is disguised as?

29
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:09,892
It will be among the luggage

30
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:11,978
and should look like a gift.

31
00:05:12,562 --> 00:05:14,022
That's the bomb.

32
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:17,567
SPECIAL OPERATIONS UNIT

33
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:19,736
Seat 10B. Passenger's name is Zolzaya.

34
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:22,071
Check for a gift box of hers.

35
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:23,489
It's most likely liquor.

36
00:05:23,573 --> 00:05:25,616
Once found, proceed to detonation.

37
00:05:40,798 --> 00:05:41,758
It's me.

38
00:05:42,341 --> 00:05:44,177
Get me an antidote right away.

39
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:45,887
I don't have any.

40
00:05:48,598 --> 00:05:50,016
Where's Madam Kim?

41
00:05:50,099 --> 00:05:51,267
I'm at her place.

42
00:05:53,269 --> 00:05:55,938
If I don't find any in her fridge,
they're not here.

43
00:05:57,231 --> 00:05:58,733
Why would they be in the fridge?

44
00:05:58,816 --> 00:06:01,819
The antidote must be refrigerated.

45
00:06:02,403 --> 00:06:04,113
It can't be kept at room temperature.

46
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:06,991
It has to be kept cold?

47
00:06:07,575 --> 00:06:09,118
Ryu Si-o also takes the drug,

48
00:06:09,827 --> 00:06:10,661
so…

49
00:06:11,704 --> 00:06:12,747
it's at Doogo.

50
00:06:14,749 --> 00:06:16,501
Joong-gan!

51
00:06:18,086 --> 00:06:20,296
Joong-gan.

52
00:06:21,672 --> 00:06:22,757
Joong-gan?

53
00:06:24,258 --> 00:06:25,384
Joong-gan!

54
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:39,440
Joong-gan…

55
00:06:40,274 --> 00:06:41,692
Hang in there.

56
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:45,571
Please hang in there.

57
00:06:47,698 --> 00:06:49,117
Hang in there.

58
00:06:50,993 --> 00:06:51,911
Joong-gan…

59
00:06:58,918 --> 00:06:59,836
She's unconscious.

60
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:13,349
Push 30 ml of vasopressin.

61
00:07:14,183 --> 00:07:15,393
Beginning CPR.

62
00:07:15,476 --> 00:07:17,478
One, two, three…

63
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:20,022
What is this about?

64
00:07:20,731 --> 00:07:21,649
What the hell?

65
00:07:23,609 --> 00:07:24,444
Stop him!

66
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:30,741
Move.

67
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:33,494
Step aside!

68
00:07:34,912 --> 00:07:37,373
I called the police
regarding a theft at the warehouse.

69
00:07:48,593 --> 00:07:49,469
Please investigate

70
00:07:50,094 --> 00:07:51,137
thoroughly.

71
00:08:48,569 --> 00:08:50,571
I'm at Iwon Studio Apartments.

72
00:08:50,655 --> 00:08:52,615
This is where Madam Kim lives.

73
00:09:01,249 --> 00:09:02,708
You backstabbing bitch!

74
00:09:13,594 --> 00:09:14,762
Excuse me.

75
00:09:14,845 --> 00:09:17,265
We're the DIU
of the Seoul Metropolitan Police.

76
00:09:17,348 --> 00:09:18,766
Are you Kim Jeong-suk?

77
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:24,146
You two are under arrest for the violation
of the Narcotics Control Act.

78
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:26,315
You have the right to an attorney

79
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:29,485
and may request the court
to review the legality of your arrest.

80
00:09:32,697 --> 00:09:34,448
Ms. Gil's oxygen saturation is dropping.

81
00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:36,033
Charge 70 joules on the defibrillator.

82
00:09:37,368 --> 00:09:38,744
One, two, shock.

83
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:40,454
Give me 150 joules.

84
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:41,706
One, two, shock.

85
00:09:42,623 --> 00:09:43,749
Charge 200 joules.

86
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:45,209
One, two, shock.

87
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:21,120
Mom!

88
00:10:21,704 --> 00:10:23,539
Are you all right?

89
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:31,422
Where's Nam-soon?

90
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:33,758
She's still…

91
00:10:34,342 --> 00:10:35,301
Nam-soon!

92
00:10:35,384 --> 00:10:36,636
Wait.

93
00:10:36,719 --> 00:10:38,262
Geum-ju.

94
00:10:38,346 --> 00:10:40,097
-Mom!
-Geum-ju!

95
00:10:41,682 --> 00:10:42,725
Wait.

96
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:11,504
Nam-soon.

97
00:11:22,556 --> 00:11:23,599
Thank you.

98
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:32,566
What the hell? Who made this mess?

99
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:34,652
-Get searching.
-Yes, sir.

100
00:11:36,153 --> 00:11:38,489
We're not the only party
hunting for Ryu Si-o.

101
00:11:38,572 --> 00:11:39,824
Have you checked the CCTV footage?

102
00:11:39,907 --> 00:11:41,909
He gave the gift to the Mongolian woman,

103
00:11:41,992 --> 00:11:43,994
disguised himself in the restroom,
and snuck out.

104
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:11,105
I know where you are.

105
00:12:12,857 --> 00:12:16,527
You're where Pavel first brought you.

106
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:26,829
-What the hell?
-Damn it.

107
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:27,830
Did it get disconnected?

108
00:12:27,913 --> 00:12:30,666
We have the location
of Gyeonggi Province's CTA4885 dealer.

109
00:12:30,749 --> 00:12:32,042
I'm coming with you.

110
00:12:32,126 --> 00:12:33,169
Sure.

111
00:12:33,878 --> 00:12:35,254
Keep an eye on Dr. Choi.

112
00:12:36,046 --> 00:12:37,047
Hello?

113
00:12:39,717 --> 00:12:40,843
Good luck out there.

114
00:12:45,973 --> 00:12:47,975
I'm saying this because no one's around.

115
00:12:48,809 --> 00:12:49,852
Mister,

116
00:12:49,935 --> 00:12:51,854
don't smirk at me like that.

117
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:54,773
-That's a warning.
-I know where Ryu Si-o is.

118
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:56,108
-You're lying.
-I'm not.

119
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:57,651
-Where is he?
-Who knows?

120
00:12:57,735 --> 00:12:59,278
-You said you did.
-I do.

121
00:13:00,821 --> 00:13:02,198
Are you kidding me?

122
00:13:10,247 --> 00:13:11,790
Hey, you!

123
00:13:12,374 --> 00:13:15,044
You think I'm a pushover
because I keep it nice and civil?

124
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:16,670
They say nutcases handle nutcases,

125
00:13:16,754 --> 00:13:18,547
and crazies handle crazies.

126
00:13:19,215 --> 00:13:20,925
So what will it be?

127
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:26,180
Get talking,

128
00:13:26,972 --> 00:13:27,973
or you'll die right here.

129
00:13:28,849 --> 00:13:31,685
I'll toss your body in the garlic sack
and throw you in the Han River.

130
00:13:32,186 --> 00:13:34,146
No one will ever find you.

131
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:36,232
No one will bother, got it?

132
00:13:37,608 --> 00:13:39,818
Spill, you bastard.

133
00:13:45,032 --> 00:13:46,033
Mom.

134
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:54,625
Mom.

135
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:56,627
I'm sorry.

136
00:13:57,795 --> 00:13:59,338
I'm sorry for everything.

137
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:03,342
I'll let you do whatever you want.

138
00:14:03,842 --> 00:14:06,387
Just please come back to me.

139
00:14:07,054 --> 00:14:09,223
Mom, you can marry him.

140
00:14:09,306 --> 00:14:12,726
Take my private jet on your honeymoon
to a seven-star hotel.

141
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:15,813
I'll even buy you
a vacation home in Monaco.

142
00:14:17,064 --> 00:14:21,068
I even booked
a stem cell treatment for your birthday.

143
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:23,529
Mom…

144
00:14:27,116 --> 00:14:29,577
Really? You've booked a treatment for me?

145
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:31,036
Yes, I have.

146
00:14:35,457 --> 00:14:36,500
Mom?

147
00:14:36,584 --> 00:14:39,086
You woke me up with all that wailing.

148
00:14:39,169 --> 00:14:40,504
I heard everything.

149
00:14:40,588 --> 00:14:41,839
The vacation home in Monaco.

150
00:14:41,922 --> 00:14:43,966
Don't you dare go back on your word.

151
00:14:44,925 --> 00:14:48,012
Also, book another session
of that stem cell treatment.

152
00:14:48,637 --> 00:14:49,597
For who?

153
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,015
My Jun-hee.

154
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:54,226
We'll receive it while holding hands.

155
00:15:02,276 --> 00:15:03,652
Mom, thank you.

156
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:06,488
Yes, Geum-ju. I'll be right there.

157
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:11,410
Joong-gan has regained consciousness.

158
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:20,294
Would you like to come with me?

159
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:25,633
Go ahead without me.

160
00:15:28,093 --> 00:15:29,511
Be good to her.

161
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:32,681
Give her everything
that I failed to provide.

162
00:15:37,394 --> 00:15:38,354
By the way,

163
00:15:39,396 --> 00:15:41,148
don't do anything that deserves a beating.

164
00:16:00,709 --> 00:16:01,627
Did you sleep well?

165
00:16:03,754 --> 00:16:04,922
The antidote.

166
00:16:06,757 --> 00:16:08,634
Right. You already drank it.

167
00:16:08,717 --> 00:16:11,011
I told Chamma I'd let you get some sleep.

168
00:16:11,553 --> 00:16:13,389
Thanks for saving my life.

169
00:16:14,014 --> 00:16:15,265
And my mom's too.

170
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:16,976
Gan I-sik,

171
00:16:17,059 --> 00:16:18,435
you saved us.

172
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:21,814
You…

173
00:16:23,357 --> 00:16:25,109
I thought you were going to die.

174
00:16:28,904 --> 00:16:30,406
Do you have any idea how scared I was?

175
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:34,243
I told you I wouldn't die.

176
00:16:35,703 --> 00:16:36,870
It's all right.

177
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:41,750
Hold on.

178
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:43,544
Hee-sik, we have Ryu Si-o's location.

179
00:16:43,627 --> 00:16:45,421
He's at a boxing gym near Mount Gobong.

180
00:16:46,088 --> 00:16:47,589
I texted you the address.

181
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:48,632
Sure.

182
00:16:57,558 --> 00:16:58,934
Gan I-sik, off we go!

183
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:01,103
Okay.

184
00:17:05,107 --> 00:17:05,983
Get in.

185
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:13,949
My mom bought it for me. Hop in.

186
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:15,492
-Let me drive.
-No.

187
00:17:15,576 --> 00:17:17,036
I'm driving. It's my car.

188
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:24,043
Have you practiced?

189
00:17:24,126 --> 00:17:25,919
There's nothing like learning by doing.

190
00:17:32,634 --> 00:17:34,178
Okay, here we go.

191
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:11,799
It's been a while.

192
00:18:42,871 --> 00:18:44,790
This is a Hungarian song.

193
00:18:45,499 --> 00:18:50,587
I heard it every time
I was punished in this cell.

194
00:18:51,338 --> 00:18:52,464
Hungary.

195
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:56,135
Pavel would have
a division there too, right?

196
00:18:56,677 --> 00:18:57,678
No.

197
00:18:58,387 --> 00:18:59,888
Gypsies live there.

198
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:02,099
Gypsies?

199
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:06,145
I heard that gypsies

200
00:19:07,354 --> 00:19:09,439
are naturally gifted musicians

201
00:19:09,523 --> 00:19:13,443
who are described as
being born playing the fiddle.

202
00:19:14,194 --> 00:19:15,445
They dance and sing…

203
00:19:16,446 --> 00:19:18,574
all day long.

204
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:22,828
Let's make a run for it someday

205
00:19:23,912 --> 00:19:25,289
to Hungary.

206
00:19:48,103 --> 00:19:49,271
Binbin.

207
00:19:52,816 --> 00:19:53,650
You were alive.

208
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:55,777
Pavel discards

209
00:19:56,278 --> 00:20:00,157
those who learn to form emotional ties.

210
00:20:01,283 --> 00:20:06,371
We should never have become
special to one another.

211
00:20:07,331 --> 00:20:08,540
That day,

212
00:20:08,624 --> 00:20:11,251
the day we swore to run away together,

213
00:20:11,793 --> 00:20:14,588
I was sent to Hungary.

214
00:20:15,756 --> 00:20:18,091
The place wasn't just home to gypsies.

215
00:20:19,593 --> 00:20:21,053
Pavel was there too.

216
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:24,181
Since then,

217
00:20:24,264 --> 00:20:27,976
instead of killing me,
they continued to train me.

218
00:20:28,977 --> 00:20:31,063
And I was finally given
my first assignment,

219
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:33,607
which is you.

220
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:38,570
I must

221
00:20:39,154 --> 00:20:40,322
kill you…

222
00:20:41,949 --> 00:20:42,991
in order to live.

223
00:21:02,135 --> 00:21:03,470
I thought you'd be different.

224
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:09,977
You will be shackled to Pavel
your entire life,

225
00:21:11,728 --> 00:21:12,729
only to be

226
00:21:14,356 --> 00:21:15,899
abandoned by them in the end.

227
00:21:18,068 --> 00:21:19,069
Like I was.

228
00:21:20,696 --> 00:21:22,197
We'd already been abandoned by the world

229
00:21:23,407 --> 00:21:25,075
by the time Pavel had found us.

230
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:32,082
BOXING

231
00:21:42,926 --> 00:21:46,346
I was abandoned three times.

232
00:21:47,556 --> 00:21:48,432
Once…

233
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:51,643
by my birth parents.

234
00:21:52,853 --> 00:21:55,022
Once by the woman…

235
00:21:56,356 --> 00:21:57,441
I had trusted.

236
00:21:59,526 --> 00:22:00,944
And once more…

237
00:22:04,656 --> 00:22:06,283
by the only friend I've missed.

238
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:14,082
I wish

239
00:22:14,958 --> 00:22:16,543
to go out

240
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:19,171
as only…

241
00:22:22,215 --> 00:22:23,759
having been betrayed twice.

242
00:23:19,356 --> 00:23:20,190
Go!

243
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,652
Ryu Si-o, surrender!

244
00:23:48,301 --> 00:23:49,302
Tsar Bomba.

245
00:23:50,428 --> 00:23:51,680
Ryu Si-o, no!

246
00:23:57,769 --> 00:23:58,770
"Die…

247
00:24:01,148 --> 00:24:02,315
with dignity."

248
00:24:56,453 --> 00:24:57,996
FORENSICS

249
00:25:19,893 --> 00:25:20,810
Inspector Kang,

250
00:25:20,894 --> 00:25:22,729
Yoon Sang-cheol has been arrested.

251
00:25:24,773 --> 00:25:25,815
Right.

252
00:25:25,899 --> 00:25:27,943
By the way, there used to be an orphanage

253
00:25:28,026 --> 00:25:29,194
right on this spot.

254
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:31,947
It shut down a few years ago,

255
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:34,449
and Ryu Si-o bought the land at a bargain.

256
00:25:37,077 --> 00:25:39,079
Will you excuse me? Hello?

257
00:25:40,121 --> 00:25:41,122
You got him?

258
00:25:41,206 --> 00:25:42,332
Okay.

259
00:25:43,625 --> 00:25:45,210
They have Kyle's location.

260
00:25:45,293 --> 00:25:47,379
-Where is he?
-Saegyeong Hospital.

261
00:25:47,462 --> 00:25:49,714
The hospital contacted us
after seeing the wanted notice.

262
00:25:49,798 --> 00:25:51,883
He's been an inpatient there
under a fake name.

263
00:25:57,097 --> 00:25:57,931
BREAKING NEWS

264
00:25:58,014 --> 00:26:00,850
POLICE AND PROSECUTORS' OFFICE
WILL INVESTIGATE ALL INVOLVED WITH CTA4885

265
00:26:00,934 --> 00:26:01,768
I see.

266
00:26:02,811 --> 00:26:04,521
You did well, Inspector Kang.

267
00:26:09,442 --> 00:26:10,568
Ms. Gold,

268
00:26:10,652 --> 00:26:12,195
you achieved an incredible feat.

269
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:14,531
It was merely the tip of the iceberg.

270
00:26:15,448 --> 00:26:17,284
The crimes will continue.

271
00:26:18,576 --> 00:26:20,870
Obtaining the antidote
is the more pressing matter.

272
00:26:22,038 --> 00:26:26,042
I must beat it out of that lab rat.

273
00:26:27,043 --> 00:26:28,628
In the Hwang Geum-ju way.

274
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:34,384
Where is Commissioner General
Lee Jeong-sik?

275
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:36,720
We know you had him.

276
00:26:36,803 --> 00:26:39,723
Ryu Si-o's secretary Yoon Sang-cheol
told us everything.

277
00:26:39,806 --> 00:26:41,308
He said you held him captive.

278
00:26:43,351 --> 00:26:45,270
Do you also take the drugs?

279
00:26:45,353 --> 00:26:47,105
I'd have to be insane to take them.

280
00:26:47,188 --> 00:26:49,024
It's better to just die.

281
00:27:13,048 --> 00:27:14,549
You distributed drugs,

282
00:27:15,258 --> 00:27:17,969
abducted innocent people,
and even assaulted them.

283
00:27:22,932 --> 00:27:25,101
Be grateful
you're being arrested in Korea.

284
00:27:25,185 --> 00:27:26,519
If we were in Russia,

285
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:28,938
I would've already killed you.

286
00:27:32,609 --> 00:27:33,443
Got it.

287
00:27:34,194 --> 00:27:35,111
There you go.

288
00:27:37,530 --> 00:27:38,615
Is that so?

289
00:27:39,115 --> 00:27:40,283
Understood.

290
00:27:41,576 --> 00:27:42,410
So?

291
00:27:42,994 --> 00:27:45,288
They successfully rescued
Commissioner General Lee.

292
00:27:48,041 --> 00:27:48,958
Anyway,

293
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:51,711
we managed to apprehend
all CTA4885 distributors.

294
00:27:51,795 --> 00:27:53,213
The issue now is supplying antidotes.

295
00:27:53,797 --> 00:27:56,257
This may seem like just a drug case,

296
00:27:56,341 --> 00:27:57,467
but the antidote is key.

297
00:27:57,550 --> 00:27:59,761
-The antidote?
-Before Pavel gets to it,

298
00:27:59,844 --> 00:28:01,388
we must find it first.

299
00:28:02,472 --> 00:28:04,349
What about at Doogo?

300
00:28:04,432 --> 00:28:05,934
The box I found was the last of it.

301
00:28:06,017 --> 00:28:07,352
We're not on the right track.

302
00:28:18,905 --> 00:28:20,323
Let's go to Dogang Stationery.

303
00:28:20,949 --> 00:28:23,159
Why would we go there all of a sudden?

304
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:25,829
You know, that stationery shop.

305
00:28:25,912 --> 00:28:27,831
The place where they kept Dr. Choi hidden.

306
00:28:27,914 --> 00:28:29,290
I think I saw something there.

307
00:28:29,374 --> 00:28:30,583
Like what?

308
00:28:30,667 --> 00:28:34,671
I saw some sort of vapor
coming from the stationery shop.

309
00:28:35,422 --> 00:28:36,881
Then should we start there?

310
00:28:37,465 --> 00:28:38,633
-Sure.
-Okay.

311
00:28:39,134 --> 00:28:40,927
Shouldn't we have a plan of some sort?

312
00:28:42,429 --> 00:28:44,347
He's wearing a fancy coat today.

313
00:28:44,431 --> 00:28:46,099
Let's use that to our advantage.

314
00:28:47,684 --> 00:28:49,018
What's that supposed to mean?

315
00:28:58,945 --> 00:29:00,572
I knew at first sight.

316
00:29:01,823 --> 00:29:03,408
The man who deals junk food

317
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:07,162
and assorted tools of learning

318
00:29:07,787 --> 00:29:09,748
would preside over
all that's good and evil.

319
00:29:09,831 --> 00:29:10,832
Only you…

320
00:29:11,875 --> 00:29:12,959
can see me as I am.

321
00:29:13,042 --> 00:29:14,002
Look at me.

322
00:29:14,502 --> 00:29:16,379
Witness me in all my glory!

323
00:29:16,463 --> 00:29:17,297
Damn it.

324
00:29:44,866 --> 00:29:45,784
Gan I-sik,

325
00:29:45,867 --> 00:29:46,868
are you getting this?

326
00:29:48,119 --> 00:29:49,245
Okay.

327
00:29:49,329 --> 00:29:51,414
Chamma, send this video
to the special counsel.

328
00:29:51,498 --> 00:29:52,540
Got it.

329
00:29:52,624 --> 00:29:55,710
And we'll arrest the man.

330
00:29:56,461 --> 00:29:58,379
Ask for vehicles
to transport the antidote.

331
00:29:58,463 --> 00:29:59,339
Yes, sir.

332
00:30:11,559 --> 00:30:13,061
We appreciate your cooperation.

333
00:30:13,645 --> 00:30:15,271
-Don't mention it.
-Shall we?

334
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:34,415
You must be sad that Ryu Si-o died.

335
00:30:35,875 --> 00:30:38,127
Don't you think you're too talented

336
00:30:38,211 --> 00:30:41,214
to rot as a lab rat
for a criminal like him?

337
00:30:41,297 --> 00:30:42,674
Don't speak ill of him.

338
00:30:42,757 --> 00:30:44,217
He was perfection.

339
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:48,304
He gladly volunteered
for all the clinical trials.

340
00:30:48,972 --> 00:30:50,348
We were one and the same!

341
00:30:51,349 --> 00:30:55,395
Don't use convoluted speech
to talk him up.

342
00:30:55,478 --> 00:30:58,940
You were only fond of him because
he let an ex-con become a researcher

343
00:30:59,023 --> 00:31:02,110
and paid hefty bonuses for your work.

344
00:31:02,193 --> 00:31:03,111
That wasn't it.

345
00:31:05,488 --> 00:31:06,531
Right.

346
00:31:07,323 --> 00:31:09,951
I hear you're allergic to corn.

347
00:31:10,034 --> 00:31:12,829
You've been suffering from PTSD

348
00:31:12,912 --> 00:31:15,582
ever since bullies
stuffed rotten corn down your throat

349
00:31:15,665 --> 00:31:17,792
when you were 14.

350
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:22,964
Would you rather be tormented
with corn rice in prison for life

351
00:31:24,007 --> 00:31:25,091
or

352
00:31:25,174 --> 00:31:29,637
peacefully hand over
the formula for the antidote?

353
00:31:30,722 --> 00:31:32,599
No, this can't be.

354
00:31:32,682 --> 00:31:34,976
No!

355
00:31:38,229 --> 00:31:39,981
I bet you thought
I still suffered from PTSD.

356
00:31:41,065 --> 00:31:42,567
I've already been cured.

357
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:52,327
Truth be told,

358
00:31:53,077 --> 00:31:53,953
I…

359
00:31:54,787 --> 00:31:56,956
was hoping to get you the Nobel Prize.

360
00:31:57,457 --> 00:31:59,792
It's something I can guarantee,

361
00:32:00,293 --> 00:32:02,253
especially with that talent of yours.

362
00:32:02,962 --> 00:32:03,880
However,

363
00:32:03,963 --> 00:32:06,799
there's nothing I can do
if you don't want it.

364
00:32:07,634 --> 00:32:10,970
Go ahead and rot in jail.

365
00:32:11,596 --> 00:32:15,308
Corn rice yesterday, corn rice tomorrow,

366
00:32:15,391 --> 00:32:17,018
canned corn, and…

367
00:32:17,101 --> 00:32:19,479
What's so grand
about a Nobel Prize anyway?

368
00:32:19,562 --> 00:32:21,397
The prize money is only 1.3 billion won.

369
00:32:21,481 --> 00:32:24,108
As if the prize money is important.

370
00:32:24,192 --> 00:32:26,444
What else matters more than money?

371
00:32:26,527 --> 00:32:27,487
Whatever.

372
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:29,238
What's the use of wasting my breath?

373
00:32:29,322 --> 00:32:31,783
I'm not highly educated,
so I wanted to sweet corn…

374
00:32:31,866 --> 00:32:35,578
I mean, I wanted to sponsor
a Nobel Prize winner in Chemistry.

375
00:32:35,662 --> 00:32:37,622
Since you aren't interested,
I'll have to look elsewhere.

376
00:32:37,705 --> 00:32:39,082
I have places to be, so…

377
00:32:39,165 --> 00:32:40,833
Wait.

378
00:32:50,885 --> 00:32:51,761
What is it?

379
00:32:53,888 --> 00:32:55,223
It's human nature

380
00:32:56,349 --> 00:32:58,017
to want prizes and awards.

381
00:32:59,686 --> 00:33:01,104
Come to think of it,

382
00:33:01,187 --> 00:33:04,273
the only prize I've ever won
is a prized meal.

383
00:33:11,656 --> 00:33:12,782
Hey, Nam-gil.

384
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:14,993
Ms. Hwang, it's bad!

385
00:33:16,911 --> 00:33:18,037
What now?

386
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:33,177
The office is empty,

387
00:33:33,261 --> 00:33:34,762
and the sign is gone.

388
00:33:34,846 --> 00:33:37,348
He left ten million won in his drawer

389
00:33:38,057 --> 00:33:39,308
and vanished into thin air.

390
00:33:39,392 --> 00:33:40,727
I knew this would happen.

391
00:33:41,811 --> 00:33:43,229
Goodness.

392
00:33:45,064 --> 00:33:46,524
Let me ask this one thing.

393
00:33:47,692 --> 00:33:51,821
How the hell did you
first get to know him?

394
00:33:52,405 --> 00:33:53,740
I met him at church.

395
00:33:53,823 --> 00:33:55,408
I was attending early-morning service.

396
00:33:55,491 --> 00:33:56,492
At church?

397
00:33:56,576 --> 00:33:58,411
Bread goes to church?

398
00:33:58,494 --> 00:33:59,328
Yes.

399
00:34:00,246 --> 00:34:02,457
We were volunteering
for a bible study group

400
00:34:02,957 --> 00:34:05,001
when he offered me a job one day.

401
00:34:06,335 --> 00:34:08,838
I bet the people there were loaded.

402
00:34:08,921 --> 00:34:10,506
It wasn't like that.

403
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:12,383
Something that stood out

404
00:34:12,467 --> 00:34:14,886
was the fact that he adored Saint Paulus.

405
00:34:15,595 --> 00:34:18,431
He said we must be
as passionate as Paulus was.

406
00:34:18,514 --> 00:34:20,475
Paulus, who once persecuted Jesus,

407
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:23,019
became one of his most devoted apostles.

408
00:34:23,603 --> 00:34:25,146
-Paulus?
-Yes.

409
00:34:25,938 --> 00:34:29,108
He also left this note behind.

410
00:34:34,447 --> 00:34:35,281
It's hot.

411
00:34:36,157 --> 00:34:37,742
Be careful of the steam.

412
00:34:41,537 --> 00:34:43,748
Gosh, your hands must hurt.

413
00:34:46,834 --> 00:34:48,544
"Be like the merciful Paul."

414
00:34:52,006 --> 00:34:55,635
That's right. In English, Paulus is Paul.

415
00:34:57,386 --> 00:34:59,639
Nam-gil, bring the car around.

416
00:35:00,431 --> 00:35:01,265
Yes, ma'am.

417
00:35:08,439 --> 00:35:10,441
Load them up, boys.

418
00:35:10,525 --> 00:35:11,734
We need these on the boat by today.

419
00:35:11,818 --> 00:35:12,944
-Yes, ma'am.
-Yes, ma'am.

420
00:35:17,532 --> 00:35:18,449
Su-san,

421
00:35:19,909 --> 00:35:21,244
where are you headed?

422
00:35:22,453 --> 00:35:23,287
You…

423
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:26,040
Don't mind her and get to work.

424
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:27,250
-Yes, ma'am.
-Yes, ma'am.

425
00:35:33,297 --> 00:35:35,299
When did you become
some sort of a sorceress?

426
00:35:36,843 --> 00:35:41,848
Unfortunately, I have yet
to obtain the ability to teleport.

427
00:35:42,682 --> 00:35:44,225
I'll keep this short.

428
00:35:45,518 --> 00:35:46,519
Bread.

429
00:35:47,436 --> 00:35:48,938
Where are you hiding him?

430
00:35:49,021 --> 00:35:51,440
-He smuggled himself out of the country.
-Out of the country?

431
00:35:51,524 --> 00:35:54,402
Yes, he requested a boat
that would smuggle him to Italy.

432
00:35:54,485 --> 00:35:56,988
But I never thought
he'd take off like this.

433
00:35:57,071 --> 00:36:01,075
Just how much money was he managing?

434
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:03,119
I can't give you an exact number.

435
00:36:03,911 --> 00:36:06,038
He was also in business with Mr. Chen.

436
00:36:06,122 --> 00:36:07,540
Mr. Chen?

437
00:36:07,623 --> 00:36:09,542
One-armed Mr. Chen, the loan shark?

438
00:36:11,544 --> 00:36:14,338
From what I hear, Mr. Chen's disappeared.

439
00:36:32,648 --> 00:36:33,566
It's fascinating

440
00:36:33,649 --> 00:36:37,862
that you two can sense my energy
when I use my strength.

441
00:36:37,945 --> 00:36:40,239
It runs in our family among the women.

442
00:36:40,323 --> 00:36:43,743
Geum-ju had it rough
pulling it together in the middle.

443
00:36:43,826 --> 00:36:46,037
I know it was hard for you too, Mom.

444
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:48,247
You were even kidnapped.

445
00:36:48,915 --> 00:36:49,749
By the way,

446
00:36:49,832 --> 00:36:51,042
what will you be doing next?

447
00:36:51,125 --> 00:36:54,378
I know for certain
what I want to do with my life.

448
00:36:55,713 --> 00:36:56,756
-Me too.
-Me too.

449
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:00,760
What is it for you, Mom?

450
00:37:07,683 --> 00:37:09,310
Thank you, Jun-hee.

451
00:37:09,393 --> 00:37:10,353
Don't thank me.

452
00:37:11,145 --> 00:37:13,898
Someone born with a gift like you

453
00:37:14,482 --> 00:37:16,442
should do something meaningful with it.

454
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:21,155
Do you know when I first fell for you?

455
00:37:22,031 --> 00:37:23,699
It was when you helped me

456
00:37:23,783 --> 00:37:26,160
solve the voice phishing scam.

457
00:37:31,707 --> 00:37:32,833
Strike!

458
00:37:32,917 --> 00:37:33,876
Goodness.

459
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,670
Why would you find that attractive?

460
00:37:36,337 --> 00:37:38,297
It only makes me want to be tougher.

461
00:37:38,381 --> 00:37:40,132
Be as tough as you want.

462
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:42,760
I can handle it.

463
00:37:45,096 --> 00:37:46,180
Let's head inside.

464
00:37:48,891 --> 00:37:51,185
These are the fraud cases
from the last three months.

465
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:52,812
SENIOR WELFARE ASSOCIATION

466
00:37:57,233 --> 00:37:59,318
You don't need to take any exams.

467
00:37:59,402 --> 00:38:01,320
Once you answer a few questions,

468
00:38:01,404 --> 00:38:03,197
-you'll get your license.
-The elderly hand over

469
00:38:03,281 --> 00:38:05,324
their personal information
in the hopes of getting a job,

470
00:38:05,408 --> 00:38:08,035
which is then used
for fake bank accounts or illegal loans.

471
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:09,829
You'd better pay up

472
00:38:09,912 --> 00:38:11,122
for the lectures you took.

473
00:38:11,205 --> 00:38:14,125
We've been witnessing
a rise in extortion cases

474
00:38:14,208 --> 00:38:16,919
where scammers trick the elderly
into supposed scam protection classes

475
00:38:17,003 --> 00:38:19,213
only to force them to pay the fees.

476
00:38:20,923 --> 00:38:22,717
These dirtbags must be taught a lesson.

477
00:38:23,217 --> 00:38:26,429
The police are too busy
to handle these cases,

478
00:38:26,512 --> 00:38:29,557
and most of the elderly don't know
how to go about these situations.

479
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:32,226
These damn rats deserve a whole lot worse

480
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:34,395
than rotting away in the sewers.

481
00:38:37,565 --> 00:38:38,607
You're mesmerizing.

482
00:38:40,234 --> 00:38:41,610
They won't get away with this.

483
00:38:53,497 --> 00:38:55,207
The legal team

484
00:38:55,291 --> 00:38:58,961
will be busier than they have ever been.

485
00:38:59,503 --> 00:39:01,881
First, let's discuss
the Korea Communications Commission.

486
00:39:02,548 --> 00:39:05,384
We're filing a case against them
for the fine they issued.

487
00:39:05,926 --> 00:39:09,263
Rather than informing the public
of the dangers of CTA4885,

488
00:39:09,764 --> 00:39:13,100
they charged Geumju TV with a fine

489
00:39:13,184 --> 00:39:15,644
under the pretext of defamation.

490
00:39:15,728 --> 00:39:18,356
I'm the one
who had her reputation tarnished.

491
00:39:18,439 --> 00:39:20,900
Prepare a defamation countersuit
against them.

492
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:23,069
Ask for a compensation amount…

493
00:39:24,779 --> 00:39:25,654
of 100 billion won.

494
00:39:27,990 --> 00:39:29,158
Second,

495
00:39:29,241 --> 00:39:32,495
go after the directors
and shareholders of Doogo.

496
00:39:32,578 --> 00:39:36,916
Even though they knew about CTA4885,

497
00:39:36,999 --> 00:39:39,168
they either kept silent
or aided the operation.

498
00:39:39,251 --> 00:39:42,713
There's solid proof
that Ryu Si-o tried to kill me,

499
00:39:42,797 --> 00:39:44,882
but no one has released
any kind of statement.

500
00:39:45,508 --> 00:39:48,219
It is undoubtedly gross negligence.

501
00:39:48,302 --> 00:39:49,136
Ms. Hwang,

502
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:53,516
you're talking about foreign companies
and foreign individuals.

503
00:39:54,183 --> 00:39:55,768
That's even better.

504
00:39:55,851 --> 00:39:59,480
I'll have them stand trial
in an international court.

505
00:40:08,447 --> 00:40:09,365
Lastly,

506
00:40:11,283 --> 00:40:12,493
Pavel.

507
00:40:13,202 --> 00:40:14,745
No matter how long it takes

508
00:40:15,496 --> 00:40:17,289
or how much it costs,

509
00:40:18,457 --> 00:40:20,918
I will take down the criminal organization

510
00:40:21,001 --> 00:40:23,629
that hurts people with its dark influence

511
00:40:25,548 --> 00:40:26,924
with my own hands.

512
00:40:28,884 --> 00:40:31,137
Hwang Geum-ju, the founder of Geumju TV,

513
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:33,722
who solved what is now being called
CTA4885-gate,

514
00:40:33,806 --> 00:40:36,267
the biggest drug case
in the nation's history,

515
00:40:36,851 --> 00:40:38,519
never shut down her broadcast

516
00:40:38,602 --> 00:40:40,896
despite having her life threatened

517
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:42,857
or being pressured by authorities.

518
00:40:43,441 --> 00:40:45,901
The true heroes of society live among us.

519
00:40:45,985 --> 00:40:48,070
The Drug Investigation Unit
of Ganghan Police Precinct,

520
00:40:48,154 --> 00:40:49,530
please step forward.

521
00:40:56,996 --> 00:40:58,414
Attention, salute.

522
00:41:01,041 --> 00:41:02,168
At ease.

523
00:41:02,251 --> 00:41:06,005
This unit solved the CTA4885 drug case

524
00:41:06,088 --> 00:41:09,550
and arrested all 349 distributors
of the drug ring.

525
00:41:09,633 --> 00:41:12,678
We commend their contribution
to the eradication of drugs.

526
00:41:12,761 --> 00:41:15,973
Also, all members will be rewarded
with a special promotion.

527
00:41:21,687 --> 00:41:25,774
Next, the commissioner general
will announce the special recruit.

528
00:41:25,858 --> 00:41:28,319
Gang Nam-soon, please come forward.

529
00:41:28,402 --> 00:41:29,403
Yes!

530
00:41:36,452 --> 00:41:37,369
Attention.

531
00:41:37,453 --> 00:41:38,412
Salute.

532
00:41:39,038 --> 00:41:41,165
By taking the initiative
in the war against drugs,

533
00:41:41,248 --> 00:41:43,584
you actively aided
the police's investigation

534
00:41:43,667 --> 00:41:46,212
and showed a great performance
beyond that of a normal citizen.

535
00:41:46,295 --> 00:41:49,048
Your love and devotion to the people

536
00:41:49,131 --> 00:41:52,176
is what the police agency
looks for in a police officer.

537
00:41:52,259 --> 00:41:54,094
Thus, by the authority
of the commissioner general,

538
00:41:54,178 --> 00:41:56,347
the agency recruits you as one of its own.

539
00:41:56,931 --> 00:41:59,892
Seoul Metropolitan Police
Commissioner General Lee Jeong-sik.

540
00:42:08,734 --> 00:42:11,362
-Nam-soon, you look incredible!
-Nam-soon!

541
00:42:19,453 --> 00:42:20,788
CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR GLORIOUS PROMOTION

542
00:42:25,793 --> 00:42:27,545
Grandpa.

543
00:42:27,628 --> 00:42:31,173
Goodness, my granddaughter.
I finally get to meet you.

544
00:42:32,258 --> 00:42:33,384
Let's eat.

545
00:42:43,102 --> 00:42:45,104
We're having a family dinner,

546
00:42:45,187 --> 00:42:47,982
but we're not really sure
if we're family, strangers,

547
00:42:48,065 --> 00:42:49,275
or a bit of both.

548
00:42:51,026 --> 00:42:53,988
This is to celebrate my father
being discharged from the hospital

549
00:42:54,071 --> 00:42:57,533
as well as Nam-soon
joining the police force

550
00:42:57,616 --> 00:42:58,993
as a special recruit.

551
00:42:59,076 --> 00:42:59,910
Also,

552
00:42:59,994 --> 00:43:02,288
it's to announce my new beginning.

553
00:43:03,998 --> 00:43:08,294
Mother, was it necessary
to bring that up at this very moment?

554
00:43:09,253 --> 00:43:12,047
Could we please not argue tonight

555
00:43:12,631 --> 00:43:15,593
and enjoy a peaceful dinner for once?

556
00:43:15,676 --> 00:43:16,969
I highly doubt it.

557
00:43:17,052 --> 00:43:20,264
We have a weird tendency
to let arguments bring us closer.

558
00:43:20,347 --> 00:43:21,390
It's become a habit.

559
00:43:21,473 --> 00:43:23,517
Well, if things are already in shambles,

560
00:43:23,601 --> 00:43:25,060
I'll add one more thing.

561
00:43:25,144 --> 00:43:26,729
-I--
-Can we eat first, Mom?

562
00:43:38,032 --> 00:43:39,033
Thanks.

563
00:43:40,367 --> 00:43:42,786
Allow me to say something first.

564
00:43:44,997 --> 00:43:47,541
I can't lie to you saying I wish you well.

565
00:43:49,168 --> 00:43:50,711
But I'll let you go.

566
00:43:51,503 --> 00:43:54,214
I do so out of the love I have for you.

567
00:43:54,298 --> 00:43:56,133
Dad, come on.

568
00:43:56,216 --> 00:43:57,718
Good for you, Dad.

569
00:43:58,636 --> 00:44:01,388
I'll look for a place for you to live.

570
00:44:01,472 --> 00:44:04,975
I'd like to live in a house
rather than an apartment unit.

571
00:44:05,059 --> 00:44:06,101
One with a garden.

572
00:44:06,185 --> 00:44:07,561
Ask for a pool too, why don't you?

573
00:44:07,645 --> 00:44:09,938
I wouldn't mind that either.

574
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:14,652
Anyway, this frees me up
to marry someone else, right?

575
00:44:17,988 --> 00:44:18,822
Geum-dong,

576
00:44:19,615 --> 00:44:21,408
can you find me someone

577
00:44:22,034 --> 00:44:24,495
who's on the feeble side

578
00:44:24,578 --> 00:44:27,081
and has a lot of emotional baggage?

579
00:44:27,748 --> 00:44:29,917
-You're asking me when I'm also single?
-Jeez.

580
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,461
Since we're talking about remarrying,

581
00:44:32,544 --> 00:44:34,088
I'd like Geum-ju and Bong-go

582
00:44:34,838 --> 00:44:36,256
to get back together.

583
00:44:38,550 --> 00:44:40,302
I agree. Yes!

584
00:44:40,386 --> 00:44:43,681
Our family's conversations
tend to bounce around without warning.

585
00:44:43,764 --> 00:44:46,266
No one can live alone in this world.

586
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:47,976
Nam-soon has returned to us,

587
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:49,019
so get back together.

588
00:44:49,103 --> 00:44:51,939
I'm afraid I can't agree to that.

589
00:44:52,022 --> 00:44:52,856
What?

590
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:54,274
Geum-ju

591
00:44:54,858 --> 00:44:56,693
shouldn't have to live as someone's wife.

592
00:44:57,694 --> 00:45:00,030
Rather than being
just Nam-soon and Nam-in's mother,

593
00:45:00,531 --> 00:45:01,865
she should get to…

594
00:45:02,866 --> 00:45:04,952
navigate this world as Hwang Geum-ju.

595
00:45:05,035 --> 00:45:08,372
Why would you frame her
as just being your wife?

596
00:45:08,455 --> 00:45:12,418
I meant that you should be
a supportive husband to her.

597
00:45:12,501 --> 00:45:15,087
Be a docile husband and keep her company.

598
00:45:15,170 --> 00:45:16,839
I can say this much as his roommate.

599
00:45:16,922 --> 00:45:17,756
He's quite good at that.

600
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:19,508
I can't deny that, but…

601
00:45:22,344 --> 00:45:24,638
Let me handle my personal life.

602
00:45:26,932 --> 00:45:28,976
We'll talk about this later.

603
00:45:30,936 --> 00:45:31,854
Maybe we should.

604
00:45:32,396 --> 00:45:33,522
That reminds me,

605
00:45:34,273 --> 00:45:36,150
I thought we'd meet

606
00:45:36,859 --> 00:45:39,194
Hee-sik's family next week
to discuss their wedding.

607
00:45:39,278 --> 00:45:41,113
Have you talked it over with them?

608
00:45:41,196 --> 00:45:42,030
No.

609
00:45:42,823 --> 00:45:44,032
But I will.

610
00:45:44,116 --> 00:45:45,534
Did he even propose to you?

611
00:45:46,535 --> 00:45:47,411
No.

612
00:45:48,078 --> 00:45:50,581
Our family has a tendency
to just do whatever they want

613
00:45:50,664 --> 00:45:52,666
without considering others.

614
00:45:52,749 --> 00:45:54,168
Shouldn't we work on that?

615
00:45:56,879 --> 00:45:58,755
The approach of this fine weather

616
00:45:58,839 --> 00:46:01,091
has put a spring in our step.

617
00:46:01,175 --> 00:46:03,343
How about you enjoy a weekend outing

618
00:46:03,427 --> 00:46:06,180
-with friends and family…
-That news anchor for Geumju TV.

619
00:46:06,763 --> 00:46:08,390
I'd love to take her out on a date.

620
00:46:08,474 --> 00:46:09,641
Can you put in a good word?

621
00:46:11,059 --> 00:46:12,019
Do you like her?

622
00:46:12,603 --> 00:46:13,604
She's totally my type.

623
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:16,106
Guys.

624
00:46:16,190 --> 00:46:17,941
You won't believe this.

625
00:46:19,026 --> 00:46:21,403
Do you know who the owner
of Dogang Stationery is?

626
00:46:21,487 --> 00:46:23,447
-Who is he?
-Ryu Si-o's biological father.

627
00:46:24,323 --> 00:46:27,117
I ran his DNA to test for drugs,

628
00:46:27,201 --> 00:46:30,078
and it was already registered from
when he put his child up for adoption.

629
00:46:30,162 --> 00:46:32,247
That child turned out to be Ryu Si-o.

630
00:46:33,207 --> 00:46:35,959
His DNA came up as a match
with the sample from Ryu Si-o's autopsy.

631
00:46:36,043 --> 00:46:38,045
"Probability of paternity, 99.98%."

632
00:46:38,629 --> 00:46:39,463
Wow.

633
00:46:39,546 --> 00:46:42,257
So he tracked down
his biological father and…

634
00:46:44,426 --> 00:46:47,346
This young man came to see me one day.

635
00:46:48,722 --> 00:46:50,307
He was quite good-looking too.

636
00:46:50,933 --> 00:46:51,808
He…

637
00:46:52,935 --> 00:46:55,395
opened a stationery store for me.

638
00:46:55,479 --> 00:46:58,023
DOGANG STATIONERY

639
00:46:58,106 --> 00:47:01,985
I had never met anyone
who was that generous before.

640
00:47:03,237 --> 00:47:04,655
I'm still curious

641
00:47:05,322 --> 00:47:07,783
as to why he was so good to me.

642
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:13,997
I wonder why he tracked down his father.

643
00:47:14,706 --> 00:47:15,707
Beats me.

644
00:47:16,416 --> 00:47:19,378
Also, why was he generous
to the man who abandoned him?

645
00:47:20,587 --> 00:47:21,797
Ryu Si-o

646
00:47:22,631 --> 00:47:23,840
must've been lonely.

647
00:47:24,716 --> 00:47:27,219
He must've needed someone
he could lean on.

648
00:47:28,387 --> 00:47:32,516
He once said that having
just one person believe in him

649
00:47:33,016 --> 00:47:34,309
was all he needed in life.

650
00:47:34,393 --> 00:47:37,896
If he hadn't been taken by Pavel,

651
00:47:39,481 --> 00:47:41,275
if he had grown up in a normal family,

652
00:47:42,276 --> 00:47:44,194
he would've grown up as a smart person.

653
00:47:45,237 --> 00:47:48,156
Who your parents are
is vital to your upbringing.

654
00:47:49,241 --> 00:47:50,117
Absolutely.

655
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:53,203
That's why I'm the luckiest girl on earth.

656
00:47:59,876 --> 00:48:01,128
That being said,

657
00:48:02,879 --> 00:48:04,047
I know for sure…

658
00:48:05,132 --> 00:48:07,759
I can be a really great dad.

659
00:48:09,511 --> 00:48:11,138
If I had a daughter

660
00:48:11,221 --> 00:48:12,681
who had incredible strength,

661
00:48:13,765 --> 00:48:15,225
I know I could teach her

662
00:48:15,309 --> 00:48:17,853
to use that strength for something good.

663
00:48:21,982 --> 00:48:22,816
Are you…

664
00:48:23,859 --> 00:48:26,320
asking me to marry you?

665
00:48:26,403 --> 00:48:27,362
Yes.

666
00:48:28,322 --> 00:48:29,865
Marry me.

667
00:48:38,415 --> 00:48:42,544
Ppappa, I just received
a marriage proposal!

668
00:48:42,628 --> 00:48:44,671
Hold on. I wasn't done.

669
00:48:44,755 --> 00:48:46,006
The ring.

670
00:48:46,089 --> 00:48:47,299
The ring!

671
00:49:06,318 --> 00:49:08,320
I heard you grew up in Mongolia.

672
00:49:08,403 --> 00:49:10,238
Is that where you graduated high school?

673
00:49:10,322 --> 00:49:11,865
Yes, school number two.

674
00:49:12,366 --> 00:49:13,825
I grew up in the countryside,

675
00:49:13,909 --> 00:49:16,119
so there were only two schools in total.

676
00:49:16,203 --> 00:49:17,245
And college…

677
00:49:18,622 --> 00:49:19,998
Of course you didn't go.

678
00:49:21,333 --> 00:49:24,169
I don't have a college degree either.

679
00:49:25,962 --> 00:49:27,422
This is my hotel though,

680
00:49:28,006 --> 00:49:30,133
so please order as much as you please.

681
00:49:30,217 --> 00:49:31,635
Once the kids marry,

682
00:49:32,177 --> 00:49:34,304
please come by for breakfast at any time.

683
00:49:34,888 --> 00:49:36,223
Are you saying

684
00:49:36,306 --> 00:49:38,767
you're the owner of this hotel?

685
00:49:38,850 --> 00:49:39,726
Yes.

686
00:49:40,560 --> 00:49:41,770
But it's embarrassing

687
00:49:42,521 --> 00:49:43,814
not to have a college degree

688
00:49:43,897 --> 00:49:47,859
and to only be able to invite you
to this shabby six-star hotel.

689
00:49:49,736 --> 00:49:51,154
After the marriage,

690
00:49:51,780 --> 00:49:53,073
I wish to give Hee-sik

691
00:49:53,156 --> 00:49:55,909
a building in his name.

692
00:49:57,285 --> 00:49:58,912
I have five on Dosan-daero,

693
00:49:58,995 --> 00:50:01,289
four on Apgujeong Rodeo Street…

694
00:50:01,373 --> 00:50:03,125
Wait, was it five?

695
00:50:03,208 --> 00:50:04,668
That's enough. Take the call.

696
00:50:08,255 --> 00:50:09,715
Please pardon me.

697
00:50:13,677 --> 00:50:14,636
Yes, Nam-gil.

698
00:50:15,887 --> 00:50:16,805
That building?

699
00:50:17,681 --> 00:50:20,183
I told you to donate it
to the Ahyeon Foundation.

700
00:50:20,726 --> 00:50:22,310
The 75 million won it brings in monthly

701
00:50:22,394 --> 00:50:24,104
should be enough to sponsor the children.

702
00:50:24,187 --> 00:50:25,272
Later.

703
00:50:26,231 --> 00:50:27,065
Mother,

704
00:50:27,816 --> 00:50:29,776
I don't need buildings in my name.

705
00:50:30,444 --> 00:50:32,779
What date do you have in mind?

706
00:50:33,572 --> 00:50:35,198
We should speed things up.

707
00:50:35,282 --> 00:50:38,618
Our family has a tradition of its own.

708
00:50:39,619 --> 00:50:42,497
So the sooner, the better.

709
00:50:42,581 --> 00:50:43,623
A tradition?

710
00:50:43,707 --> 00:50:47,919
You see, it's imperative
that they have daughters.

711
00:50:48,003 --> 00:50:51,339
The bloodline must be carried on.

712
00:50:51,423 --> 00:50:53,341
As if one would be enough.

713
00:50:54,009 --> 00:50:57,679
If my daughter-in-law is up for it,
they could even have ten.

714
00:50:58,472 --> 00:51:00,307
-Put in some effort.
-What…

715
00:51:00,390 --> 00:51:02,559
Then they can live in Gangnam
as newlyweds.

716
00:51:02,642 --> 00:51:05,645
Since his surname is Kang, Gangnam it is.

717
00:51:06,730 --> 00:51:07,731
It's perfect.

718
00:51:07,814 --> 00:51:09,483
I'm fond of his surname as well.

719
00:51:10,192 --> 00:51:11,651
What do you mean by that?

720
00:51:11,735 --> 00:51:16,114
Would you have gotten them a place
in Anguk-dong if his surname was An?

721
00:51:16,198 --> 00:51:17,365
That's right.

722
00:51:17,449 --> 00:51:19,451
It corresponds
to our family's sense of duty.

723
00:51:20,076 --> 00:51:21,745
We have to protect the neighborhood.

724
00:51:21,828 --> 00:51:23,914
If his surname was Woo, Ui-dong.

725
00:51:23,997 --> 00:51:25,749
If it was Gu, Gusan-dong.

726
00:51:25,832 --> 00:51:27,250
If it was Yeon, Yeonhui-dong--

727
00:51:27,334 --> 00:51:28,502
Of course.

728
00:51:28,585 --> 00:51:32,214
One family member married someone
with the surname Nam recently

729
00:51:32,297 --> 00:51:34,299
and went to live in Namgajwa-dong.

730
00:51:34,382 --> 00:51:37,093
If his surname was Park, then where…

731
00:51:37,177 --> 00:51:40,013
Then they'd have to go to Bakdaljae
to uphold tradition.

732
00:51:42,849 --> 00:51:45,101
But we can compromise with Banghak-dong.

733
00:51:47,604 --> 00:51:52,108
We as a family can be quite flexible.

734
00:51:52,192 --> 00:51:53,193
Flexibility is nice.

735
00:51:53,276 --> 00:51:55,237
My son is flexible too.

736
00:51:55,320 --> 00:51:57,280
-I see.
-You can do the splits, can't you?

737
00:51:57,364 --> 00:51:58,824
-Ms. Gil.
-Yes?

738
00:51:58,907 --> 00:52:01,284
Let me show you how flexible I am.

739
00:52:03,453 --> 00:52:04,913
Dad, don't.

740
00:52:06,957 --> 00:52:09,543
Ms. Gil, here you go.

741
00:52:24,724 --> 00:52:26,226
Don't lose hope.

742
00:52:27,727 --> 00:52:29,062
I'm not homeless.

743
00:52:34,943 --> 00:52:36,444
Ms. No.

744
00:52:42,826 --> 00:52:43,827
Come on.

745
00:52:44,995 --> 00:52:46,329
Why are you doing this to me?

746
00:52:46,413 --> 00:52:49,332
Did you have to go this far
when what we had was brief?

747
00:52:49,416 --> 00:52:51,835
I even gave you the middle part
of my triangle gimbap.

748
00:52:52,377 --> 00:52:53,837
Do you know how much I cared?

749
00:52:54,754 --> 00:52:57,132
I beat up others
at the clothing donation bin

750
00:52:57,215 --> 00:52:58,717
just to get you designer clothes.

751
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:00,552
Do you know why I even did that?

752
00:53:01,136 --> 00:53:03,263
How do you think you became
the most stylish vagrant?

753
00:53:04,472 --> 00:53:06,182
It isn't a crime to fall out of love.

754
00:53:06,266 --> 00:53:08,268
Should the consequences be this harsh?

755
00:53:10,270 --> 00:53:13,106
You said you never loved anyone.

756
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:16,860
It's what you said
in a magazine interview.

757
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:19,112
You said you've never truly been in love.

758
00:53:20,447 --> 00:53:22,365
Meanwhile, I loved you for real.

759
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:25,076
You can't take back what you gave--

760
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:27,454
You did the same with your heart.

761
00:53:27,537 --> 00:53:28,580
You penniless jerk.

762
00:53:48,391 --> 00:53:50,226
Get some rest.
It's your first shift tomorrow.

763
00:53:50,310 --> 00:53:52,145
Don't you have anything for me?

764
00:53:52,729 --> 00:53:53,647
Like what?

765
00:53:53,730 --> 00:53:55,982
Come on. You know what.

766
00:53:56,066 --> 00:53:59,569
It's what I gave you
when you took me home the last time.

767
00:54:04,407 --> 00:54:05,533
This?

768
00:54:07,577 --> 00:54:09,621
-No.
-Then what is it?

769
00:54:31,434 --> 00:54:34,479
Is Nozh still in Korea?

770
00:54:35,397 --> 00:54:38,817
We don't have any updates
regarding Nozh's whereabouts.

771
00:54:38,900 --> 00:54:41,361
However,
we obtained some intriguing intel.

772
00:54:42,237 --> 00:54:43,780
It's about why Nozh was in Korea.

773
00:54:47,158 --> 00:54:50,620
Intel has it that Nozh
is one of Pavel's most brutal killers.

774
00:54:51,746 --> 00:54:53,832
With Sabaki being physically weak,

775
00:54:53,915 --> 00:54:55,709
the organization needed a new boss.

776
00:54:55,792 --> 00:54:58,753
That's why Nozh gained support
as the successor.

777
00:54:59,337 --> 00:55:02,215
They wanted to uphold the Mafia tradition.

778
00:55:02,924 --> 00:55:05,301
The brutal and cruel Nozh

779
00:55:05,885 --> 00:55:08,304
wasn't well-versed in finance,

780
00:55:08,388 --> 00:55:09,597
so they sent him to Korea.

781
00:55:10,306 --> 00:55:11,307
To study finance.

782
00:55:11,391 --> 00:55:12,851
To study finance?

783
00:55:12,934 --> 00:55:16,563
Sabaki wanted him to learn
about finance and the economy.

784
00:55:16,646 --> 00:55:19,149
His first lesson seemed to have been
money laundering,

785
00:55:20,775 --> 00:55:23,945
but he often sent encrypted messages
saying he wanted to quit.

786
00:55:24,029 --> 00:55:25,572
I doubt he found it fun.

787
00:55:26,114 --> 00:55:27,365
To him, wielding knives

788
00:55:28,116 --> 00:55:29,743
must be easier than managing money.

789
00:55:33,121 --> 00:55:36,708
Ryu Si-o's death opened up a crack
in Pavel's Asian division.

790
00:55:37,792 --> 00:55:41,212
That means we'll soon
be able to unmask Nozh.

791
00:55:42,047 --> 00:55:44,340
Information usually leaks through cracks.

792
00:56:24,297 --> 00:56:25,632
Welcome!

793
00:56:27,425 --> 00:56:28,635
Salute!

794
00:56:28,718 --> 00:56:29,761
Salute!

795
00:56:30,470 --> 00:56:32,138
You never know what the future holds.

796
00:56:32,222 --> 00:56:33,890
Who knew the Mongolian ger constructor

797
00:56:33,973 --> 00:56:35,975
would end up working out of our precinct?

798
00:56:36,059 --> 00:56:37,352
I'll do my best.

799
00:56:37,435 --> 00:56:39,020
I'm ready to take on anything!

800
00:56:39,104 --> 00:56:40,188
Please take it easy.

801
00:56:40,271 --> 00:56:41,314
That'd be more helpful.

802
00:56:44,150 --> 00:56:45,193
Begin your shift.

803
00:56:46,319 --> 00:56:47,529
-Let's do this.
-All right.

804
00:56:50,365 --> 00:56:51,741
-Yes!
-Go, us!

805
00:56:55,161 --> 00:56:57,997
A joint response request came in from
the Special Drug Investigation Division.

806
00:56:58,748 --> 00:57:01,126
Location verified. Let's roll!

807
00:57:01,668 --> 00:57:03,253
Hurry. Get ready.

808
00:57:04,504 --> 00:57:05,505
Go.

809
00:57:06,422 --> 00:57:08,174
Go, Gang Nam-soon!

810
00:57:10,593 --> 00:57:11,803
Delivery's here.

811
00:57:11,886 --> 00:57:13,304
-Nice.
-Who ordered a criminal?

812
00:57:13,388 --> 00:57:15,306
-Good job.
-Hey, Na-young.

813
00:57:15,390 --> 00:57:16,224
How've you been?

814
00:57:16,307 --> 00:57:17,642
Tripe hot pot sounds nice.

815
00:57:17,725 --> 00:57:18,852
Sure.

816
00:57:22,397 --> 00:57:23,898
GANGHAN POLICE PRECINCT
SPECIAL DRUG INVESTIGATION TEAM

817
00:57:23,982 --> 00:57:25,108
Hee-sik.

818
00:57:27,402 --> 00:57:29,571
The secret phone Ryu Si-o was using.

819
00:57:29,654 --> 00:57:30,947
We never found it at the scene, right?

820
00:57:31,531 --> 00:57:33,783
-Right.
-It's still being used

821
00:57:33,867 --> 00:57:35,577
by someone with the code name Binbin.

822
00:57:35,660 --> 00:57:38,204
A Tsar Bomba has been issued

823
00:57:38,872 --> 00:57:40,957
and the target is "Gold."

824
00:57:47,088 --> 00:57:49,507
-The operation is a go.
-Nam-soon, wait.

825
00:57:50,091 --> 00:57:51,092
Hey!

826
00:57:51,176 --> 00:57:53,052
And now,

827
00:57:53,136 --> 00:57:56,139
let us collect your donations.

828
00:57:56,222 --> 00:57:57,265
Wait.

829
00:57:57,348 --> 00:57:58,558
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

830
00:57:58,641 --> 00:58:01,060
I'm afraid I don't have any cash--

831
00:58:01,144 --> 00:58:02,187
Jeez.

832
00:58:03,271 --> 00:58:06,900
You had the audacity to come to my lecture
without any money?

833
00:58:08,276 --> 00:58:09,903
Boys, close the door.

834
00:58:11,613 --> 00:58:13,198
Don't let anyone leave

835
00:58:13,281 --> 00:58:15,575
-What?
-until they pay up!

836
00:58:31,341 --> 00:58:33,718
Has this old hag lost her mind?

837
00:58:34,302 --> 00:58:35,386
Do you have a death wish?

838
00:58:41,976 --> 00:58:43,228
I am Gil Joong-gan.

839
00:58:44,270 --> 00:58:45,897
My name may mean "in the middle,"

840
00:58:46,439 --> 00:58:48,775
but there's nothing moderate about me.

841
00:58:49,859 --> 00:58:51,069
From this moment on,

842
00:58:51,152 --> 00:58:53,780
anyone who tries to scam the elderly…

843
00:58:56,533 --> 00:58:59,702
will answer to me.

844
00:59:13,049 --> 00:59:15,969
Mother, you must watch your back.

845
00:59:16,052 --> 00:59:19,013
Nozh has you as his next target.

846
00:59:23,643 --> 00:59:25,436
We have identified Nozh.

847
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:26,563
Here's his photo.

848
00:59:30,733 --> 00:59:33,695
OPULENTIA

849
00:59:40,118 --> 00:59:42,620
Be like the merciful Paul.

850
00:59:43,371 --> 00:59:46,499
The members of Pavel
refer to the drugs as Paul.

851
00:59:52,088 --> 00:59:53,840
Was it you all along, Bread?

852
00:59:55,258 --> 00:59:58,428
Then you were in Busan that day
to intercept the sea hares.

853
01:00:03,266 --> 01:00:04,517
Just you wait.

854
01:00:05,560 --> 01:00:06,561
I'll…

855
01:00:08,104 --> 01:00:09,522
kill you myself.

856
01:00:36,758 --> 01:00:39,344
Remember what I said
about excessive force?

857
01:00:39,427 --> 01:00:41,262
You told me not to punch anyone.

858
01:00:41,346 --> 01:00:43,556
All I did was nudge them with this.

859
01:00:46,059 --> 01:00:47,935
Besides, this was self-defense.

860
01:00:49,896 --> 01:00:51,606
He tried to shoot me with that.

861
01:00:53,066 --> 01:00:54,233
Why you…

862
01:00:56,361 --> 01:00:57,487
You bastard.

863
01:00:58,154 --> 01:01:00,031
How dare you point a gun at a cop?

864
01:01:01,324 --> 01:01:03,201
You damn druggie.

865
01:01:03,284 --> 01:01:05,119
-Shoot me, why don't you?
-Reel him in.

866
01:01:05,203 --> 01:01:06,579
-Shoot.
-He's gone nuts.

867
01:01:06,663 --> 01:01:09,374
-Shoot me, damn it!
-Hee-sik, stop.

868
01:01:09,457 --> 01:01:11,000
-Shoot me, damn it.
-Don't.

869
01:01:11,084 --> 01:01:13,503
We're at 687-gil.
The suspects have been arrested.

870
01:01:13,586 --> 01:01:14,671
-You'll get in trouble.
-Damn it.

871
01:01:14,754 --> 01:01:16,506
What the hell is going on?

872
01:01:17,340 --> 01:01:18,633
-You…
-What are you doing?

873
01:01:19,967 --> 01:01:21,052
What?

874
01:01:22,345 --> 01:01:23,596
Damn it.

875
01:01:28,434 --> 01:01:31,562
There's this cool line
from a K-drama I once watched.

876
01:01:31,646 --> 01:01:32,689
Do you know what it is?

877
01:01:34,023 --> 01:01:38,903
"The world should never be a place
where the bad guys are the winners."

878
01:01:48,871 --> 01:01:50,289
I'll make sure it isn't.

879
01:01:50,373 --> 01:01:53,793
Because I am the strong girl,
Gang Nam-soon.

880
01:01:53,876 --> 01:01:55,002
Bring it!

881
01:01:55,670 --> 01:01:58,381
STAY TUNED FOR ADDITIONAL SCENES

882
01:02:32,206 --> 01:02:34,542
STRONG GIRL NAM-SOON

883
01:02:35,543 --> 01:02:38,129
SPECIAL THANKS TO
OH NA-RA AND LEE HONG-NAE

884
01:02:40,131 --> 01:02:41,841
Anyway, where did Geum-ju go?

885
01:02:41,924 --> 01:02:43,676
-To Jangchung-dong.
-For pig trotters?

886
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:45,887
No, to meet Yun-hui.

887
01:02:45,970 --> 01:02:47,388
You know who she is.

888
01:02:47,472 --> 01:02:48,639
Her son is Chung-dong.

889
01:02:48,723 --> 01:02:49,557
Chung-dong?

890
01:02:54,729 --> 01:02:56,230
CHUNG-DONG KING PIG TROTTERS

891
01:03:09,118 --> 01:03:10,119
What brings you by?

892
01:03:10,203 --> 01:03:12,413
I sent you money to expand the restaurant,

893
01:03:12,997 --> 01:03:14,040
but you still haven't done it.

894
01:03:14,123 --> 01:03:15,333
Well…

895
01:03:16,083 --> 01:03:17,794
I needed it to cover his settlements.

896
01:03:18,669 --> 01:03:19,712
Yun-hui.

897
01:03:20,838 --> 01:03:23,174
Where's Chung-dong?

898
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:25,551
I told him to stay to make deliveries,

899
01:03:26,135 --> 01:03:27,553
but he must've taken off.

900
01:03:29,806 --> 01:03:30,807
What is this about?

901
01:03:30,890 --> 01:03:31,849
I…

902
01:03:32,558 --> 01:03:34,352
need him.

903
01:03:34,435 --> 01:03:35,520
I'd like…

904
01:03:36,395 --> 01:03:37,396
to give him a mission.

905
01:03:38,064 --> 01:03:40,566
Geum-ju, please take him with you.

906
01:03:40,650 --> 01:03:42,610
Make a worthy man out of him.

907
01:03:42,693 --> 01:03:43,694
Call him here.

908
01:03:46,948 --> 01:03:47,865
Hey.

909
01:03:47,949 --> 01:03:48,866
Jang Chung-dong.

910
01:03:50,660 --> 01:03:52,161
Jang

911
01:03:52,245 --> 01:03:58,376
Chung-dong!

912
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:01,254
An anomaly in his Y chromosome

913
01:04:01,337 --> 01:04:03,673
made him a man with exceptional strength.

914
01:04:04,257 --> 01:04:06,592
I think Geum-ju wants him to work for her.

915
01:04:07,218 --> 01:04:08,511
-Jang
-Jang

916
01:04:08,594 --> 01:04:12,056
-Chung-dong!
-Chung-dong!

917
01:04:15,226 --> 01:04:16,352
No way.

918
01:04:16,435 --> 01:04:18,813
He's no joke, being a mutant and all.

919
01:04:21,816 --> 01:04:26,821
