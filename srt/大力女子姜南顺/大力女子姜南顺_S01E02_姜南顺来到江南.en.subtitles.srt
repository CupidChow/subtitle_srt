1
00:00:42,667 --> 00:00:45,962
STRONG GIRL NAM-SOON

2
00:01:58,284 --> 00:01:59,369
Did…

3
00:01:59,452 --> 00:02:00,495
Did you…

4
00:02:01,329 --> 00:02:03,164
use your powers?

5
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:05,333
-No.
-Then who was it?

6
00:02:07,001 --> 00:02:08,002
Was it Hwa-ja?

7
00:02:08,086 --> 00:02:09,212
It wasn't her.

8
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:10,296
What?

9
00:02:18,555 --> 00:02:21,015
-All good. You may go.
-Thank you.

10
00:02:27,105 --> 00:02:29,023
Right. Thank you for your patience.

11
00:02:29,107 --> 00:02:30,108
Hold on.

12
00:02:30,191 --> 00:02:31,234
What is it?

13
00:02:34,487 --> 00:02:35,321
They're masks.

14
00:02:35,905 --> 00:02:38,074
-May I take a look?
-Sure.

15
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:47,542
They're relief supplies.
I'm a nurse, you see.

16
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:52,589
Right, it was just to make sure.

17
00:02:53,464 --> 00:02:55,842
-Thank you for your cooperation.
-Place your suitcase here.

18
00:02:55,925 --> 00:02:57,135
Next.

19
00:02:59,178 --> 00:03:01,180
Please open your bag.
This is a drug investigation.

20
00:03:03,224 --> 00:03:04,809
I don't do drugs.

21
00:03:04,893 --> 00:03:07,562
Even without them, I'm happy every day.

22
00:03:10,148 --> 00:03:13,276
These days,
even paper can be laced with drugs.

23
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:18,072
See? I don't need drugs to be happy.

24
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:32,962
What are these?

25
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:34,339
Moriny del.

26
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:35,924
Mane hair.

27
00:03:36,841 --> 00:03:38,009
The mane of a horse.

28
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:40,637
And this is argai.

29
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:41,721
Ppappa's anklebone.

30
00:03:41,804 --> 00:03:43,890
Why did you bring
a horse's mane and bones?

31
00:03:43,973 --> 00:03:46,309
It's to treasure Ppappa's soul.

32
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:48,728
-It's a Mongolian tradition.
-Are you Mongolian?

33
00:03:48,811 --> 00:03:50,063
No, I'm a Gangnam person.

34
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:52,440
Although I grew up in Mongolia.

35
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:56,069
If you're Korean, just say so.

36
00:03:56,152 --> 00:03:57,737
Why are you saying
you're a Gangnam person?

37
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:58,988
Are you even Korean?

38
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:00,323
I sure am.

39
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:03,576
Either way, these will be confiscated.

40
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:05,203
But they're not drugs!

41
00:04:05,787 --> 00:04:07,497
That's up to us to decide.

42
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:11,626
What's this?

43
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:15,129
It means a great deal to me,
so handle it with caution.

44
00:04:19,342 --> 00:04:21,010
What the heck is this?

45
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:23,304
Does this also look like drugs to you?

46
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:26,140
-Why you…
-What is it? Hand it over.

47
00:04:28,851 --> 00:04:30,186
It's quite heavy.

48
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,354
Is this gold-plated?

49
00:04:31,437 --> 00:04:33,273
It means the world to me.

50
00:04:33,356 --> 00:04:34,440
I see.

51
00:04:34,524 --> 00:04:36,234
We'll be inspecting this as well.

52
00:04:36,317 --> 00:04:37,402
Look here, cop.

53
00:04:37,485 --> 00:04:39,237
Our forensics team will test it.

54
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,322
There's no way of knowing
what's inside this,

55
00:04:41,406 --> 00:04:43,866
so you will get it back
once it has been cleared.

56
00:04:56,921 --> 00:04:58,006
Not this.

57
00:04:59,048 --> 00:05:00,967
I need it to find my mom.

58
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:03,094
Your mom?

59
00:05:04,095 --> 00:05:07,056
I have to find my mom.

60
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:11,352
Have you lost her?

61
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,571
I'm a police officer.

62
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:23,906
I'll help you

63
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:25,867
find your mom.

64
00:05:37,378 --> 00:05:38,296
Okay.

65
00:05:40,048 --> 00:05:41,174
Promise me.

66
00:05:52,643 --> 00:05:53,686
What's your name?

67
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:55,688
It's Kang Hee-sik.

68
00:05:57,315 --> 00:06:00,193
I'll engrave that name on my heart.

69
00:06:09,577 --> 00:06:11,704
The smell of Gangnam.

70
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:19,128
Gangnam.

71
00:06:36,687 --> 00:06:38,272
I'm here.

72
00:06:38,356 --> 00:06:39,690
Did I keep you waiting?

73
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:41,734
Let's do this!

74
00:06:49,534 --> 00:06:54,372
EPISODE 2
GANGNAM, HERE I COME

75
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:59,585
All passengers on board
landed safe and sound.

76
00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:03,673
Mid-flight, a female passenger
kicked the door and jumped out.

77
00:07:03,756 --> 00:07:05,883
You don't believe me, do you?

78
00:07:05,967 --> 00:07:10,221
Find her and ask her yourself.

79
00:07:16,811 --> 00:07:19,397
It's not easy to find a place
looking over the Han River,

80
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,857
so consider yourself lucky.

81
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:23,443
My sister and her husband
have gone to the US

82
00:07:23,526 --> 00:07:24,444
to teach for a year.

83
00:07:24,527 --> 00:07:27,613
If you wish to stay longer
after three months, go ahead.

84
00:07:27,697 --> 00:07:29,657
No, three months is more than enough.

85
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:31,909
I will find my parents during that time.

86
00:07:31,993 --> 00:07:34,412
But why are you talking informally to me?

87
00:07:34,495 --> 00:07:35,496
I'm older than you.

88
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:39,125
This is the Korean I learned for a decade,
and now I'm stuck with it.

89
00:07:39,917 --> 00:07:40,835
I see.

90
00:07:41,335 --> 00:07:42,920
I'll get going then.

91
00:07:43,004 --> 00:07:45,381
Please call me if you have any questions.

92
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:46,466
Got it.

93
00:07:51,387 --> 00:07:52,597
Bye!

94
00:07:55,183 --> 00:07:59,270
Korean people are the nicest.

95
00:08:03,274 --> 00:08:04,609
I'm a police officer.

96
00:08:05,776 --> 00:08:06,903
I'll help you

97
00:08:08,112 --> 00:08:09,155
find your mom.

98
00:08:10,615 --> 00:08:12,617
Okay, I'll put my faith in you.

99
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:39,727
Tail Hwa-ja for me.

100
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:42,813
There's a good chance
she isn't my Nam-soon.

101
00:08:42,897 --> 00:08:43,981
Why the sudden doubt?

102
00:08:45,316 --> 00:08:46,984
The women in my family

103
00:08:47,068 --> 00:08:48,861
can sense each other's energy.

104
00:08:48,945 --> 00:08:51,531
When one of us
uses a tremendous amount of power,

105
00:08:51,614 --> 00:08:53,199
the others react to it.

106
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:55,368
However,

107
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,203
Hwa-ja…

108
00:08:58,246 --> 00:08:59,914
didn't use her powers that night.

109
00:09:00,998 --> 00:09:03,125
Yes, ma'am. Understood.

110
00:09:21,352 --> 00:09:23,229
Mom!

111
00:09:24,105 --> 00:09:28,401
I'll find you no matter what!

112
00:09:28,943 --> 00:09:32,488
No matter how big this country is,

113
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:36,867
I can do it!

114
00:09:37,368 --> 00:09:39,829
I miss you,

115
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:41,122
Mom

116
00:09:41,664 --> 00:09:44,792
and Dad!

117
00:09:54,302 --> 00:09:56,345
GANGHAN POLICE PRECINCT

118
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:57,388
Coin mixing.

119
00:09:57,471 --> 00:09:59,265
It makes sure the money is untraceable.

120
00:09:59,348 --> 00:10:00,891
The distributor tells the buyer

121
00:10:00,975 --> 00:10:03,686
to wire one Bitcoin
as payment for the drugs

122
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:06,731
to address A, their disposable wallet.

123
00:10:06,814 --> 00:10:10,151
The buyer then purchases one Bitcoin
and wires it to the account.

124
00:10:10,234 --> 00:10:12,612
This is where the coin mixing begins.

125
00:10:12,695 --> 00:10:15,031
The wired Bitcoin is split

126
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:18,200
and transferred into wallets
with the addresses B, C, D, E, and F.

127
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:20,036
They're split again

128
00:10:20,703 --> 00:10:23,205
and wired to wallets G, H, I, J, and K.

129
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:24,373
Sir?

130
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,669
-I'm back, sir.
-When will we have the test results?

131
00:10:29,253 --> 00:10:31,839
Hee-sik is waiting for it at the NFS.

132
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:34,508
Let me go over these for you.

133
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:39,096
This is a real snack made up of 90% wheat.

134
00:10:41,682 --> 00:10:43,392
Forget about that. What about this?

135
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:45,853
This? It's a horse's mane.

136
00:10:47,938 --> 00:10:50,524
And this is a horse's anklebone.

137
00:10:51,442 --> 00:10:54,153
And this is 24K pure gold.

138
00:10:54,236 --> 00:10:55,154
Pure gold?

139
00:10:55,237 --> 00:10:57,365
What's embedded here are diamonds.

140
00:10:57,907 --> 00:10:59,950
-Diamonds?
-Yes.

141
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,203
How much would this be worth?

142
00:11:04,121 --> 00:11:05,247
-Just a second.
-Sure.

143
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:07,583
-Hello?
-Hee-sik.

144
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:09,335
We got a positive ID on that woman.

145
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,796
-The one with the leather boots.
-Really?

146
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:13,547
She's not your average lady.

147
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:15,049
The problem-solver of Gangnam

148
00:11:15,132 --> 00:11:16,634
and a woman of wealth.

149
00:11:16,717 --> 00:11:17,968
I'll send you her file.

150
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:24,892
GEUMJU CONSTRUCTION

GOLD BLUE'S CEO HWANG FINDS
HER LONG-LOST DAUGHTER AFTER 17 YEARS!

153
00:11:34,318 --> 00:11:35,319
I have to

154
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:37,696
find my mom.

155
00:11:44,453 --> 00:11:46,205
A gold magic wand.

156
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,333
Who is this woman?

157
00:12:03,681 --> 00:12:05,099
CEO HWANG GEUM-JU

158
00:12:20,781 --> 00:12:23,117
RECENT CALLS
MS. PARK

159
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:30,249
Ms. Park,

160
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:32,293
don't worry.

161
00:12:32,376 --> 00:12:33,502
I'm here for you.

162
00:12:34,128 --> 00:12:35,921
When you go to the police tomorrow,

163
00:12:36,005 --> 00:12:38,382
tell them the truth about everything.

164
00:12:39,133 --> 00:12:41,677
No one will dare to harm you.

165
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:47,308
You'll be able to get better with rehab.

166
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:50,561
Please trust me and do as I say.

167
00:13:17,046 --> 00:13:18,047
What the hell?

168
00:13:19,215 --> 00:13:20,466
Damn it.

169
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:31,227
It wasn't suicide.

170
00:13:31,727 --> 00:13:33,479
She jumped while hallucinating.

171
00:13:33,562 --> 00:13:35,022
If we had detained her,

172
00:13:35,105 --> 00:13:36,273
she wouldn't have died.

173
00:13:36,357 --> 00:13:38,526
It was the only way to trace
those higher up.

174
00:13:38,609 --> 00:13:42,613
This won't end until we lock up
those high up in the food chain.

175
00:13:44,782 --> 00:13:46,033
Hee-sik's not back yet?

176
00:13:46,116 --> 00:13:48,661
Apparently, no drugs were detected.

177
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:50,287
It's a flop.

178
00:13:50,371 --> 00:13:52,831
What was with that intel then?

179
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:55,376
I was told they'd be there.

180
00:13:57,503 --> 00:13:59,922
No, please proceed with it
as we suggested.

181
00:14:00,005 --> 00:14:01,048
Yes.

182
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:13,978
I'm sure you heard
about Ms. Park's passing.

183
00:14:14,895 --> 00:14:17,189
Make sure all her belongings
are returned to her family.

184
00:14:17,273 --> 00:14:19,817
What? All of them?

185
00:14:20,401 --> 00:14:21,777
-Yes.
-Yes, ma'am.

186
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:25,739
Are you going to continue
your crusade in leather boots

187
00:14:25,823 --> 00:14:27,700
even after finding your daughter?

188
00:14:27,783 --> 00:14:30,578
-I must.
-But why?

189
00:14:30,661 --> 00:14:32,454
The unthinkable has happened.

190
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:34,748
Korea is no longer a drug-free country.

191
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:39,461
I must protect it from crimes.

192
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,172
How is my money being spent?

193
00:14:43,632 --> 00:14:46,635
I pay over 400 billion won
in taxes every year,

194
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:48,846
but I can't tell
if it's being spent wisely.

195
00:14:49,346 --> 00:14:50,973
So I'll take matters into my own hands.

196
00:14:51,473 --> 00:14:53,017
Is that the only reason?

197
00:14:53,642 --> 00:14:56,896
Please don't get me wrong.
I've always been curious, that's all.

198
00:14:56,979 --> 00:15:01,567
Why are you taking it upon yourself
to disrupt the ecosystem?

199
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:02,651
I mean…

200
00:15:05,821 --> 00:15:06,864
It all began

201
00:15:07,448 --> 00:15:09,283
because of my daughter Nam-soon.

202
00:15:10,659 --> 00:15:12,119
I believed that the heavens

203
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:16,081
would protect her
for every good deed I accomplished.

204
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:18,459
But now,

205
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:21,086
it has become my lifelong mission.

206
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:23,964
There's a lot in this world

207
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:26,842
that I must take care of.

208
00:15:32,306 --> 00:15:34,725
Being outdoors all the time
gave me a tan I never asked for.

209
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:37,394
Hey.

210
00:15:37,978 --> 00:15:39,688
-I'm back.
-Hi.

211
00:15:53,744 --> 00:15:55,079
The person you called is not available.

212
00:15:55,162 --> 00:15:58,707
Please leave a message after the tone…

213
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:01,418
I thought she wanted me to call
as soon as I got her things back.

214
00:16:07,091 --> 00:16:09,760
"Korean name, Gang Nam-soon."

215
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:19,728
Gang Nam-soon?

216
00:16:32,366 --> 00:16:34,451
-Who on earth are you?
-Who are you?

217
00:16:34,535 --> 00:16:36,870
This unit is supposed to be on the market.

218
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:40,165
I booked this place for three months

219
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:42,876
through an agent on Airdnd last night.

220
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,003
What?

221
00:16:44,086 --> 00:16:46,505
Hold on while I call the homeowner.

222
00:16:52,219 --> 00:16:54,972
It seems she took everything
from your phone to your passport

223
00:16:55,055 --> 00:16:56,598
so you couldn't report her.

224
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:58,392
She was so nice though.

225
00:16:58,475 --> 00:16:59,852
Are you saying I was conned?

226
00:16:59,935 --> 00:17:02,646
All con artists are nice to their marks,

227
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:04,773
and they're impossible to catch.

228
00:17:05,649 --> 00:17:07,151
I can't believe it.

229
00:17:07,234 --> 00:17:09,278
Don't waste your time like this

230
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:12,072
and find a place to stay before nightfall.

231
00:17:12,906 --> 00:17:14,450
Do you have any extra money?

232
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:15,576
Why did I even ask?

233
00:17:15,659 --> 00:17:17,119
She probably stole everything.

234
00:18:06,335 --> 00:18:08,962
You're not allowed
to enter this room without permission.

235
00:18:13,008 --> 00:18:15,010
You're allowed in here,

236
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:17,846
but why am I not allowed?
I'm her daughter.

237
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:20,015
I've been serving Ms. Hwang for ten years,

238
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:22,476
and I'm the only one
who can enter this room.

239
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:25,854
The door to the room suddenly opened,
so I stumbled into it.

240
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:28,607
Please make sure
never to enter this room again.

241
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:30,025
By the way,

242
00:18:31,985 --> 00:18:34,029
is that a safe?

243
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:36,990
Yes, and only Ms. Hwang can open it.

244
00:18:37,074 --> 00:18:38,659
The lock requires her fingerprint.

245
00:18:48,001 --> 00:18:49,461
TO HAN RIVER

246
00:18:51,338 --> 00:18:53,090
HAN RIVER PARK

247
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:03,976
Korea can't do this to me.

248
00:19:04,768 --> 00:19:06,770
How could one of its people con me?

249
00:19:22,619 --> 00:19:25,581
Yes, this is the place. Han River!

250
00:19:31,128 --> 00:19:32,754
Who knew Korea also had ger?

251
00:19:35,132 --> 00:19:37,217
GANGNAM HAN RIVER PARK
RESTROOM CONSTRUCTION

252
00:19:37,926 --> 00:19:39,803
-Are you throwing these out?
-Yes.

253
00:19:39,887 --> 00:19:41,597
-I'll take them.
-Sure.

254
00:20:49,873 --> 00:20:51,041
THIS TREE IS SET TO BE REMOVED

255
00:21:39,172 --> 00:21:40,215
Excellent.

256
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:43,218
All right. One, two.

257
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:44,803
Can you turn around?

258
00:21:44,886 --> 00:21:45,846
-Sure.
-One, two.

259
00:21:45,929 --> 00:21:49,182
I can't believe you're taking photos
at a time like this.

260
00:21:49,266 --> 00:21:51,101
We don't do same-day cancellations.

261
00:21:51,852 --> 00:21:53,103
I'll wrap this up quickly.

262
00:21:53,186 --> 00:21:55,105
The photos are for a matchmaking agency.

263
00:21:55,689 --> 00:21:57,524
I need to bring my A-game.

264
00:21:58,942 --> 00:22:01,737
As if this would increase your chances
in that department.

265
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:02,779
Why you little…

266
00:22:02,863 --> 00:22:05,490
My dream is to be
a wise father and caring husband.

267
00:22:05,574 --> 00:22:07,993
If we miss out our window to get married,

268
00:22:08,076 --> 00:22:09,619
we'll end up like our team leader.

269
00:22:10,454 --> 00:22:11,747
I think you're already heading there.

270
00:22:39,983 --> 00:22:42,486
Hee-sik, they took the bait.
Get over here.

271
00:22:42,569 --> 00:22:44,362
We're getting called in. Get changed.

272
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:48,033
Excuse me.

273
00:22:49,534 --> 00:22:51,328
Here's a discount coupon for my studio.

274
00:22:51,995 --> 00:22:54,081
I'd love to take photos
of your handsome looks.

275
00:22:54,164 --> 00:22:55,082
Sure.

276
00:22:55,165 --> 00:22:56,583
BONG PHOTO GALLERY
30% DISCOUNT

277
00:22:57,459 --> 00:22:58,376
I'll be waiting.

278
00:22:58,960 --> 00:22:59,961
Have a good day.

279
00:23:00,045 --> 00:23:02,339
-All right, goodbye.
-Goodbye.

280
00:23:13,433 --> 00:23:15,143
Is it good, Nam-in?

281
00:23:16,186 --> 00:23:17,562
Yes, it's good.

282
00:23:17,646 --> 00:23:19,231
You're always so relaxed.

283
00:23:19,314 --> 00:23:20,398
That's true.

284
00:23:24,361 --> 00:23:27,531
So you booked the unit through Airdnd
back in Mongolia?

285
00:23:27,614 --> 00:23:28,448
Yeah.

286
00:23:29,366 --> 00:23:31,660
You paid 50,000 won more
since it had a rooftop terrace.

287
00:23:31,743 --> 00:23:32,869
Yeah.

288
00:23:32,953 --> 00:23:35,872
She offered a discount
if I paid in advance, so I did.

289
00:23:35,956 --> 00:23:37,457
Your Korean is quite fluent.

290
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:38,917
I'm Korean, after all.

291
00:23:40,502 --> 00:23:44,089
But I didn't learn honorifics
while studying the language.

292
00:23:44,631 --> 00:23:47,384
That's why I speak like this.
I hope you understand.

293
00:23:47,467 --> 00:23:48,677
All right.

294
00:23:50,137 --> 00:23:51,555
Do you remember what she looked like?

295
00:23:51,638 --> 00:23:53,181
Yeah, I do.

296
00:23:54,391 --> 00:23:55,433
It's done.

297
00:23:55,934 --> 00:23:57,394
We secured the security footage.

298
00:23:57,477 --> 00:23:59,146
We'll contact you when we have a suspect.

299
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:03,150
But how can we contact you
if you have lost your phone?

300
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:05,235
You're right.

301
00:24:07,904 --> 00:24:08,780
First,

302
00:24:08,864 --> 00:24:10,282
there's a cop I must find.

303
00:24:11,032 --> 00:24:13,618
The cop who took my things

304
00:24:13,702 --> 00:24:15,537
for a drug investigation at the airport.

305
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:18,790
He said he'd contact me.

306
00:24:19,374 --> 00:24:20,584
Do you know his name?

307
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:22,752
It's Kang Hee-sik.

308
00:24:23,545 --> 00:24:25,380
-Gan I-sik.
-Excuse me?

309
00:24:25,463 --> 00:24:27,883
Gan I-sik.

310
00:24:28,466 --> 00:24:30,177
As in liver transplant?

311
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:32,137
Yeah, Gan I-sik.

312
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:34,806
I couldn't forget that weird name
even if I wanted to.

313
00:24:35,348 --> 00:24:36,892
Do you remember his face?

314
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:43,398
He's super handsome.

315
00:24:44,691 --> 00:24:45,817
But…

316
00:24:46,443 --> 00:24:47,694
he's totally my type.

317
00:25:14,554 --> 00:25:17,015
Busan Regional Customs
confiscated 90 kg of smuggled drugs,

318
00:25:17,098 --> 00:25:18,225
presumably from Vietnam.

319
00:25:18,308 --> 00:25:20,477
No way. 90 kg?

320
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:22,854
That's worth enough
to feed this whole country for a year.

321
00:25:22,938 --> 00:25:23,980
By the way,

322
00:25:24,564 --> 00:25:25,857
what was with the NIS intel?

323
00:25:25,941 --> 00:25:27,901
They were sure about a mule from Mongolia.

324
00:25:27,984 --> 00:25:30,737
They've been striking out a lot lately.

325
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:31,821
Tell me about it.

326
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:36,326
Anyway, I wonder how those two are doing.

327
00:25:39,412 --> 00:25:41,331
Come check out our latest products.

328
00:25:41,414 --> 00:25:43,375
-Right.
-No, thank you.

329
00:25:45,877 --> 00:25:47,837
-What's wrong?
-My hair.

330
00:25:47,921 --> 00:25:48,880
What about it?

331
00:25:51,299 --> 00:25:52,384
Come over here.

332
00:25:54,678 --> 00:25:56,596
-What are you doing?
-Now you look younger.

333
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:58,515
Otherwise, we won't look like newlyweds,

334
00:25:58,598 --> 00:26:00,141
especially since I'm such a baby face.

335
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:01,059
The heck?

336
00:26:01,142 --> 00:26:03,561
-Sweetheart.
-What the hell?

337
00:26:03,645 --> 00:26:05,438
This is sexual harassment.
I'll report you.

338
00:26:05,522 --> 00:26:08,316
You mean report our marriage
for registration?

339
00:26:09,234 --> 00:26:10,318
Let's just get going.

340
00:26:11,069 --> 00:26:13,029
Young-tak, she's heading inside.

341
00:26:16,449 --> 00:26:17,993
Okay. Now…

342
00:26:18,868 --> 00:26:19,911
Off you go.

343
00:26:56,656 --> 00:26:58,742
Is the person who gave you this
in the parking lot?

344
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:04,414
Where's your next stop?

345
00:27:06,416 --> 00:27:07,584
The nursing room…

346
00:27:08,376 --> 00:27:09,711
at K-Mart.

347
00:27:10,545 --> 00:27:12,088
Let's go to the parking lot.

348
00:27:19,721 --> 00:27:21,598
Are you really reducing my sentence?

349
00:27:22,182 --> 00:27:23,683
Of course.

350
00:27:23,767 --> 00:27:26,311
If you're lucky, you can get a medal
if you help us catch the boss.

351
00:27:26,394 --> 00:27:27,604
As if I need one.

352
00:27:28,521 --> 00:27:30,565
-So you don't do drugs?
-I don't.

353
00:27:30,648 --> 00:27:34,277
Why do something that'll damage your body
and ruin your life?

354
00:27:34,361 --> 00:27:35,445
Unbelievable.

355
00:27:38,365 --> 00:27:39,532
Is that her?

356
00:27:39,616 --> 00:27:40,950
Yes, it's her.

357
00:27:43,328 --> 00:27:44,412
What am I seeing?

358
00:27:44,496 --> 00:27:46,164
Could that cop's disguise be any lousier?

359
00:27:46,247 --> 00:27:48,249
I know. Blame our budget.

360
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:51,336
We should be allocating more funds
to the police like the US.

361
00:27:51,419 --> 00:27:52,462
-I know.
-You can't get

362
00:27:52,545 --> 00:27:55,715
digital forensics, forensic science,
and whatnot in that state.

363
00:27:55,799 --> 00:27:56,966
Exactly.

364
00:27:57,550 --> 00:27:58,551
Jeez.

365
00:28:07,102 --> 00:28:08,436
You little punk.

366
00:28:09,562 --> 00:28:10,605
Damn it.

367
00:28:11,314 --> 00:28:12,690
Hey, wait.

368
00:28:12,774 --> 00:28:14,192
You… Let's go.

369
00:28:24,953 --> 00:28:26,204
Hey, you!

370
00:28:26,287 --> 00:28:28,289
That guy is crazy. You can't go that way!

371
00:28:44,472 --> 00:28:45,598
We got you now.

372
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,562
What the hell? Move your car!

373
00:28:51,396 --> 00:28:52,272
No way.

374
00:28:52,355 --> 00:28:53,690
You move your car instead!

375
00:28:56,443 --> 00:28:57,444
Get in here.

376
00:28:58,653 --> 00:29:00,697
Hey, I'm hungry.
Order Chinese food for me.

377
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:01,990
-Ask for extra pickled radish.
-Sure.

378
00:29:02,073 --> 00:29:03,158
We're back.

379
00:29:03,241 --> 00:29:04,701
Hee-sik, get changed.

380
00:29:05,702 --> 00:29:07,620
It's the evidence
confiscated at the scene.

381
00:29:37,025 --> 00:29:38,318
Hey!

382
00:29:40,653 --> 00:29:42,781
Get out of my house this second.

383
00:29:43,364 --> 00:29:46,326
How is this your place?

384
00:29:46,409 --> 00:29:48,203
-Is it yours then?
-Yes.

385
00:29:48,286 --> 00:29:50,371
It's our place,
though it hasn't been registered.

386
00:29:50,455 --> 00:29:51,539
What?

387
00:29:51,623 --> 00:29:52,665
Who are you guys?

388
00:29:55,502 --> 00:29:57,128
I'm a bohemian.

389
00:29:57,212 --> 00:30:01,591
A free-spirited soul who finds a home
wherever his head can rest.

390
00:30:01,674 --> 00:30:03,301
-So you're vagrants.
-Yes, exactly.

391
00:30:03,384 --> 00:30:04,552
"Vagrants"? How dare you?

392
00:30:05,261 --> 00:30:07,806
We are victims
of this terrible social system

393
00:30:07,889 --> 00:30:10,809
that temporarily put us out of a home.

394
00:30:10,892 --> 00:30:14,854
What's wrong with everyone I've met
since landing in Korea?

395
00:30:14,938 --> 00:30:15,939
Are you a foreigner?

396
00:30:16,022 --> 00:30:17,190
What's it to you?

397
00:30:17,273 --> 00:30:18,191
She definitely is.

398
00:30:18,274 --> 00:30:20,944
You're standing on
what is obviously government property.

399
00:30:21,027 --> 00:30:23,112
Camping out here
when you don't own the land

400
00:30:23,196 --> 00:30:25,073
is considered unauthorized camping.

401
00:30:25,156 --> 00:30:26,282
-What?
-Hey.

402
00:30:26,366 --> 00:30:28,993
Why did you build this fancy tent here?

403
00:30:29,077 --> 00:30:31,579
One might think it's a Mongolian ger.

404
00:30:32,163 --> 00:30:34,290
-You know what a ger is?
-I do.

405
00:30:35,875 --> 00:30:37,502
So what's your story?

406
00:30:38,127 --> 00:30:40,547
How did you go
from tourist to homeless overnight?

407
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:42,257
I've never heard of that happening.

408
00:30:46,886 --> 00:30:49,556
Korea's a great country,
but it has too many scammers.

409
00:30:49,639 --> 00:30:51,432
We rank number one in that field.

410
00:30:51,516 --> 00:30:52,642
Do you know why?

411
00:30:52,725 --> 00:30:54,811
Because they only get a slap on the wrist.

412
00:30:54,894 --> 00:30:56,104
-Indeed.
-That's the issue.

413
00:30:56,187 --> 00:30:57,605
Take Ms. No, for example.

414
00:30:57,689 --> 00:31:01,234
She's homeless
as a result of being scammed.

415
00:31:01,317 --> 00:31:02,777
Darn it. My money.

416
00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:06,239
Anyway, it sounds like
you're going to keep staying here.

417
00:31:06,322 --> 00:31:07,615
Am I right?

418
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:09,158
Yes, that's right.

419
00:31:10,285 --> 00:31:13,371
Fine. Then here's the plan.

420
00:31:13,955 --> 00:31:16,124
I'll make you another ger next to mine.

421
00:31:17,917 --> 00:31:19,627
You'll build a house for us?

422
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:22,213
Yeah. It's no big deal.

423
00:31:23,047 --> 00:31:26,384
So for now, please leave mine.

424
00:31:26,467 --> 00:31:28,177
-You stink.
-No way.

425
00:31:28,803 --> 00:31:32,015
Nothing in this world is for free.
What can we do in return?

426
00:31:32,098 --> 00:31:35,226
I'll think of something
you vagrants could offer me.

427
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:37,103
For now, just get out.

428
00:31:37,812 --> 00:31:40,315
We will provide you
with information of value.

429
00:31:40,857 --> 00:31:42,942
A full Michelin guide
to free soup kitchens.

430
00:31:43,026 --> 00:31:45,361
A detailed map of Gangnam
rivaling Daedongyeojido

431
00:31:45,445 --> 00:31:46,779
that includes restrooms with showers

432
00:31:46,863 --> 00:31:47,989
and places that offer free calls.

433
00:31:48,072 --> 00:31:51,534
I will provide you with the know-how
on how to live without using money.

434
00:31:51,618 --> 00:31:55,038
What I tell you can't be found
on any old online sites.

435
00:31:55,705 --> 00:31:57,373
I'm grateful for the offer,

436
00:31:58,249 --> 00:32:00,209
but it kind of feels like
I've become a vagrant myself.

437
00:32:01,461 --> 00:32:02,378
Fine.

438
00:32:03,338 --> 00:32:04,422
You have a deal.

439
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:06,549
Right now,

440
00:32:06,633 --> 00:32:07,967
I'd like to grab dinner.

441
00:32:08,051 --> 00:32:08,927
Let's eat.

442
00:32:11,095 --> 00:32:12,639
Dinner will be on us today.

443
00:32:12,722 --> 00:32:14,057
ANGEL OF HEAVEN SOUP KITCHEN

444
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:16,643
FREE MEALS EVERY MONDAY, WEDNESDAY, FRIDAY

445
00:32:41,125 --> 00:32:42,502
It's so good.

446
00:32:42,585 --> 00:32:44,295
It's sweet and savory.

447
00:32:45,171 --> 00:32:47,090
I'm so happy.

448
00:32:47,173 --> 00:32:48,466
Have your fill.

449
00:32:48,549 --> 00:32:50,134
Sadang-dong is good on Fridays,

450
00:32:50,218 --> 00:32:51,678
and Jongno is good on the weekends.

451
00:32:52,261 --> 00:32:53,596
But that place gets too busy.

452
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:55,098
It's because they serve meat dishes.

453
00:32:55,181 --> 00:32:56,933
Tomorrow, we're off to Yongsan.

454
00:32:57,016 --> 00:32:59,102
Father Ji Deok-gu runs the place.

455
00:32:59,185 --> 00:33:01,729
He spares no expense
and even serves Naju rice.

456
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:03,439
He runs it well. I approve.

457
00:33:03,523 --> 00:33:05,149
You sure are picky for vagrants.

458
00:33:05,233 --> 00:33:06,317
Good for you.

459
00:33:13,282 --> 00:33:15,076
She hasn't been picking up all day.

460
00:33:15,159 --> 00:33:17,453
Please leave a message after the tone.

461
00:33:17,537 --> 00:33:21,082
-Did something happen to her?
-Standard call charges will apply.

462
00:33:23,376 --> 00:33:25,962
Ms. Gang, why haven't you been picking up?

463
00:33:26,879 --> 00:33:28,589
Call me as soon as you get this message.

464
00:33:28,673 --> 00:33:30,425
I'm leaving you my personal number.

465
00:33:30,508 --> 00:33:32,677
It's 010-0491-1077.

466
00:33:38,599 --> 00:33:40,560
I don't appreciate doing my work twice.

467
00:33:41,352 --> 00:33:43,312
Leave this to me. You go grab some food.

468
00:33:43,396 --> 00:33:44,355
Okay.

469
00:33:45,356 --> 00:33:46,399
You're up.

470
00:33:48,985 --> 00:33:50,862
Let me go already.

471
00:33:50,945 --> 00:33:53,281
I don't know anything about this.

472
00:33:53,364 --> 00:33:55,825
Of course you don't know anything.

473
00:33:55,908 --> 00:33:58,786
My guess is that drugs fall from the sky.

474
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:00,246
No one knows anything about them.

475
00:34:00,329 --> 00:34:03,082
Everything disappears
after we check the message on I-gram.

476
00:34:03,166 --> 00:34:05,376
How many times do I have to repeat myself?

477
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:09,088
So just tell us
who you met through I-gram.

478
00:34:09,172 --> 00:34:10,673
I know nothing about the distributor.

479
00:34:10,757 --> 00:34:14,052
Not their face, name, or number.

480
00:34:15,970 --> 00:34:19,182
Besides, their handle and address changes

481
00:34:19,265 --> 00:34:21,350
tens of thousands of times a day.

482
00:34:23,936 --> 00:34:24,896
Look here, Mr. Sung.

483
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:27,899
Don't make things harder for yourself
and come clean.

484
00:34:29,984 --> 00:34:32,320
What will you do for me if I do?

485
00:34:32,403 --> 00:34:33,654
What else?

486
00:34:33,738 --> 00:34:35,615
We'll show you mercy.

487
00:34:35,698 --> 00:34:38,743
You know that cooperating
can lessen your sentence.

488
00:34:38,826 --> 00:34:40,411
What is this, amateur hour?

489
00:34:56,928 --> 00:34:58,012
Chamma.

490
00:34:58,596 --> 00:35:00,890
His phone is unlocked,
so get whatever is on it.

491
00:35:00,973 --> 00:35:02,016
Got it.

492
00:35:05,728 --> 00:35:09,023
Look at how he shaved his hair
just to get out of a drug test.

493
00:35:10,108 --> 00:35:12,860
Who can say Korea is a drug-free country

494
00:35:12,944 --> 00:35:15,655
when we have dopeheads everywhere?

495
00:35:17,573 --> 00:35:19,909
What are we dealing with here?

496
00:35:23,412 --> 00:35:24,747
Its chemical formula

497
00:35:24,831 --> 00:35:28,543
is C₆₉H₂₆N₇.

498
00:35:28,626 --> 00:35:31,254
In solid form,
it looks like ripped-up tissue paper.

499
00:35:31,337 --> 00:35:33,840
However, when dissolved in water,

500
00:35:33,923 --> 00:35:37,176
it transforms into C₆₉H₂₈N₇O.

501
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:39,595
It becomes a new synthetic drug,

502
00:35:39,679 --> 00:35:42,390
one that is 200 times stronger
than the deadly fentanyl

503
00:35:42,473 --> 00:35:44,433
and 400 times stronger than heroin.

504
00:35:44,517 --> 00:35:49,105
Even 0.00001 g of this
can instantly kill you.

505
00:35:49,981 --> 00:35:52,358
This will revolutionize
the drug scene completely.

506
00:36:18,676 --> 00:36:20,678
All one needs to do
is stick it in their ear.

507
00:36:21,304 --> 00:36:22,555
It reacts 300 times faster

508
00:36:22,638 --> 00:36:24,682
when delivered to the brain than inhaled.

509
00:36:24,765 --> 00:36:26,851
It leaves your system 20 times faster

510
00:36:26,934 --> 00:36:29,103
and can't be detected in urine.

511
00:36:31,272 --> 00:36:32,440
Detective Kang.

512
00:36:33,274 --> 00:36:34,317
Yes?

513
00:36:34,817 --> 00:36:36,736
You worked customs
at Incheon Airport yesterday, right?

514
00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:38,905
-That's right.
-By any chance,

515
00:36:38,988 --> 00:36:41,407
do you remember meeting a woman
called Gang Nam-soon?

516
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:42,325
Yes.

517
00:36:42,408 --> 00:36:43,492
Someone scammed her

518
00:36:43,576 --> 00:36:46,329
and took her phone
to stop her from reporting it.

519
00:36:47,663 --> 00:36:49,790
No wonder I couldn't reach her.

520
00:36:50,374 --> 00:36:51,417
Where is she at the moment?

521
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:54,795
There's no way to reach her
since she has no phone.

522
00:36:54,879 --> 00:36:55,963
She just said she'd be back.

523
00:36:57,048 --> 00:36:59,050
Why did that have to happen to her?

524
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:02,428
Please call me right away
if she comes back.

525
00:37:02,511 --> 00:37:03,346
Of course.

526
00:37:06,057 --> 00:37:09,101
She described you as a handsome officer.

527
00:37:09,602 --> 00:37:11,479
That's how I knew right away it was you.

528
00:37:17,109 --> 00:37:18,527
I see she has taste.

529
00:37:32,667 --> 00:37:33,834
ARABESQUE CROWN TOP LUXURY PARK MANSION

530
00:37:33,918 --> 00:37:35,086
METRO TRUMP SQUARE SUPER-DUPER TOWER

531
00:37:38,464 --> 00:37:39,715
This is incredible.

532
00:37:42,051 --> 00:37:44,470
-Is this our home now?
-How is this possible?

533
00:37:44,553 --> 00:37:46,347
It's so nice!

534
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:49,350
Nam-soon, thank you so much.

535
00:37:49,433 --> 00:37:52,311
This is better than any house out there.

536
00:37:52,395 --> 00:37:54,605
Do you know how expensive
Gangnam apartments are?

537
00:37:54,689 --> 00:37:56,482
They're more than two billion won.

538
00:37:58,651 --> 00:38:01,696
We'll never be able to own one
in our lifetime.

539
00:38:01,779 --> 00:38:03,864
I'd love to register this as my property.

540
00:38:04,907 --> 00:38:05,908
Are you kidding me?

541
00:38:05,992 --> 00:38:08,077
-Get out here.
-What nonsense is this?

542
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:09,328
Get out this instant!

543
00:38:09,412 --> 00:38:11,497
Who dragged these pests out here?

544
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:12,790
-Unbelievable.
-Here they are.

545
00:38:12,873 --> 00:38:14,083
What on earth is this?

546
00:38:14,166 --> 00:38:16,460
What do you think you're doing?

547
00:38:16,544 --> 00:38:18,587
We reported you
for ruining the natural landscape.

548
00:38:18,671 --> 00:38:19,797
Take these down now!

549
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:20,923
We work our butts off

550
00:38:21,007 --> 00:38:24,719
trying to keep this park safe
from homeless people.

551
00:38:24,802 --> 00:38:27,138
How dare you build this?
Take them down this instant!

552
00:38:27,221 --> 00:38:30,099
You're blocking the path
by putting these here.

553
00:38:30,182 --> 00:38:32,810
If you lack common sense,
you should at least know your place.

554
00:38:32,893 --> 00:38:34,603
Take them down immediately.

555
00:38:34,687 --> 00:38:38,441
The park allows campers
to set up their tents here.

556
00:38:38,524 --> 00:38:40,109
I'll have it authorized
at the district office.

557
00:38:40,192 --> 00:38:41,485
Did you hear that?

558
00:38:41,569 --> 00:38:42,528
-Unbelievable.
-You punk!

559
00:38:42,611 --> 00:38:44,238
-"Punk"?
-I've had enough of this.

560
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:45,614
Let's take them down!

561
00:38:45,698 --> 00:38:47,992
-Sounds perfect.
-Take them down.

562
00:39:00,504 --> 00:39:02,965
Please look the other way just this once!

563
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:07,303
Darling!

564
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:14,643
You're talking about our home.

565
00:39:22,401 --> 00:39:24,028
Darling, I'm hurt.

566
00:39:24,111 --> 00:39:25,988
Gosh, you're scraped all over.

567
00:39:35,164 --> 00:39:37,249
What the hell was that?

568
00:39:37,333 --> 00:39:38,417
Darling!

569
00:39:44,757 --> 00:39:46,300
Talk about a colossal mess.

570
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:48,219
The mess has been made and then some.

571
00:39:48,302 --> 00:39:51,597
Everyone here
will come to the station with us.

572
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:53,808
But we didn't do anything wrong!

573
00:39:55,101 --> 00:39:56,977
What on earth did we do wrong?

574
00:39:57,061 --> 00:39:59,146
It's the police
who let the park be overrun.

575
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:01,315
I didn't pay those taxes

576
00:40:01,399 --> 00:40:03,609
so that the homeless
could set up their tents.

577
00:40:03,692 --> 00:40:05,778
If you don't have a home,
you should go to prison instead.

578
00:40:05,861 --> 00:40:07,321
If you don't take them down,

579
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:09,740
-we'll keep filing complaints.
-What he said.

580
00:40:09,824 --> 00:40:10,991
-Unbelievable.
-All right.

581
00:40:11,075 --> 00:40:12,785
-What is this?
-You lousy civil servants.

582
00:40:12,868 --> 00:40:14,995
Talk about incompetence!

583
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:16,497
Unbelievable.

584
00:40:17,081 --> 00:40:19,583
Is this the best you people can do?

585
00:40:19,667 --> 00:40:21,001
How can you let this happen?

586
00:40:21,085 --> 00:40:22,837
We're protecting the environment.

587
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:24,213
I only came here…

588
00:40:26,173 --> 00:40:28,843
to find my mom.

589
00:40:31,887 --> 00:40:35,516
This isn't what I dreamed of.

590
00:40:38,686 --> 00:40:41,981
I waited ten years for this trip to Korea

591
00:40:42,565 --> 00:40:43,858
caring for our sheep

592
00:40:45,067 --> 00:40:46,777
and saving up money.

593
00:40:51,365 --> 00:40:54,785
I studied Korean every day
for five hours a day

594
00:40:55,870 --> 00:40:58,205
and dreamed of coming here every night.

595
00:41:28,819 --> 00:41:30,112
Have you eaten?

596
00:41:30,988 --> 00:41:32,323
I looked for you all day.

597
00:41:56,096 --> 00:41:57,014
Here.

598
00:42:03,187 --> 00:42:05,731
At least this remained safe,
thanks to you.

599
00:42:08,776 --> 00:42:11,862
The scammer took everything else I owned.

600
00:42:13,572 --> 00:42:17,034
She would've taken this too
if you hadn't confiscated it.

601
00:42:22,456 --> 00:42:24,750
I heard you didn't learn honorifics
while studying Korean.

602
00:42:25,292 --> 00:42:26,627
The precinct officer told me.

603
00:42:29,672 --> 00:42:32,550
My Korean tutor back in Mongolia

604
00:42:32,633 --> 00:42:35,261
was a 93-year-old Mongolian lady

605
00:42:36,262 --> 00:42:37,763
who lived in Korea for 50 years.

606
00:42:38,347 --> 00:42:40,349
So she only taught me informal speech.

607
00:42:40,432 --> 00:42:44,562
I picked up on honorifics
while watching Korean TV shows,

608
00:42:44,645 --> 00:42:46,063
but it's hard to make it stick.

609
00:42:46,897 --> 00:42:48,983
I'm sure it'll fix itself
during my stay here.

610
00:42:51,235 --> 00:42:53,195
Does it bother you, cop?

611
00:42:53,946 --> 00:42:55,030
It does.

612
00:42:58,617 --> 00:42:59,743
Right.

613
00:42:59,827 --> 00:43:01,829
This is why early education matters.

614
00:43:02,329 --> 00:43:03,330
Then I'll be informal to you too.

615
00:43:04,331 --> 00:43:05,791
Aren't you already doing so?

616
00:43:07,418 --> 00:43:08,294
That's true.

617
00:43:14,758 --> 00:43:16,594
Are you really going to help me

618
00:43:17,928 --> 00:43:19,221
find my mom?

619
00:43:23,267 --> 00:43:24,685
I keep my promises.

620
00:43:31,609 --> 00:43:32,776
It's long overdue,

621
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:35,738
but I'll protect my mom
from the second I meet her.

622
00:43:36,238 --> 00:43:37,197
If she's broke,

623
00:43:37,281 --> 00:43:40,409
I'll work every day
to treat her to delicious meals

624
00:43:40,492 --> 00:43:42,703
and build her a ger
if she doesn't have a house.

625
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,419
Do you remember her name or face?

626
00:43:54,548 --> 00:43:55,382
No.

627
00:43:55,966 --> 00:43:57,551
I don't remember a thing.

628
00:43:59,178 --> 00:44:01,430
This was given to me by my parents

629
00:44:02,056 --> 00:44:04,600
who found and raised me in Mongolia.

630
00:44:07,394 --> 00:44:09,772
They said I was carrying this at the time.

631
00:44:15,527 --> 00:44:18,822
I doubt you'll need to work a job
even after you meet your mom.

632
00:44:20,074 --> 00:44:21,283
That's pure gold.

633
00:44:28,374 --> 00:44:31,835
That lady seems to be loaded for sure.

634
00:44:32,586 --> 00:44:34,380
The basement safe seems impenetrable,

635
00:44:34,463 --> 00:44:37,174
so I'll have to make do
with the jewelry in her bedroom.

636
00:44:37,257 --> 00:44:38,384
I'll need your help.

637
00:44:38,467 --> 00:44:40,511
Wouldn't it be better
to stay as her daughter?

638
00:44:41,011 --> 00:44:43,180
Her real daughter could show up.

639
00:44:43,972 --> 00:44:47,101
There's a good chance she's dead
seeing how she hasn't shown up yet.

640
00:44:48,143 --> 00:44:49,144
No.

641
00:44:49,812 --> 00:44:51,397
I think she's alive somewhere.

642
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:52,898
I can feel it.

643
00:44:53,774 --> 00:44:54,775
But…

644
00:44:55,859 --> 00:44:57,611
there is one problem.

645
00:44:58,695 --> 00:45:00,948
The women in that family are super strong.

646
00:45:01,782 --> 00:45:04,743
Her daughter Nam-soon
was just as strong as the lady,

647
00:45:05,285 --> 00:45:08,497
and her mom is also
a force to be reckoned with.

648
00:45:09,832 --> 00:45:10,749
Eat up.

649
00:45:11,375 --> 00:45:14,545
I ripped off about 100 million won
from that woman so far,

650
00:45:15,129 --> 00:45:17,005
not including the prize money.

651
00:45:18,882 --> 00:45:19,967
A hundred million?

652
00:45:31,854 --> 00:45:33,147
Let me know when you find my mom.

653
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:36,316
How can I when you don't have a phone?

654
00:45:36,859 --> 00:45:38,026
You can come and find me.

655
00:45:38,110 --> 00:45:39,820
I'm a busy man, so get yourself a phone.

656
00:45:39,903 --> 00:45:42,614
Maybe you should find
that scammer quickly.

657
00:45:43,323 --> 00:45:46,368
I know I'm a police officer,
but you're ordering me around too much.

658
00:45:47,369 --> 00:45:49,288
Isn't catching bad guys a priority?

659
00:45:49,371 --> 00:45:51,123
Isn't catching bad guys a given?

660
00:45:51,665 --> 00:45:54,168
I'll keep on living in that ger.

661
00:45:54,793 --> 00:45:57,129
Tell the other cops not to disturb me.

662
00:45:57,212 --> 00:45:59,298
You can't keep staying there.

663
00:46:00,799 --> 00:46:02,259
Do the police

664
00:46:02,342 --> 00:46:05,095
think it's more urgent
to kick out the homeless

665
00:46:05,179 --> 00:46:06,889
rather than to capture scammers?

666
00:46:10,767 --> 00:46:12,728
Fine. I'll catch the scammer first.

667
00:46:12,811 --> 00:46:13,770
Wait.

668
00:46:19,151 --> 00:46:20,277
Here you go.

669
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:22,112
You were scammed out of your money.

670
00:46:22,196 --> 00:46:24,698
Don't put yourself in danger outdoors
and get a room.

671
00:46:29,203 --> 00:46:31,914
I'll pay you back as soon as I get a job.

672
00:46:33,665 --> 00:46:36,126
To get a job, you'll need a new passport.

673
00:46:36,835 --> 00:46:39,004
I'll vouch for you,
so come with me to the embassy.

674
00:46:43,258 --> 00:46:44,718
Go here to get your passport photo taken.

675
00:46:44,801 --> 00:46:47,095
BONG PHOTO GALLERY
30% DISCOUNT

676
00:46:48,347 --> 00:46:49,389
Thanks.

677
00:46:51,058 --> 00:46:53,268
But cop, where do you live?

678
00:46:53,352 --> 00:46:55,562
Why are you asking? To find me there?

679
00:46:56,146 --> 00:46:57,356
Aren't you a smart one?

680
00:46:58,774 --> 00:46:59,775
Over there.

681
00:47:00,275 --> 00:47:01,944
I live on the top floor of that building.

682
00:47:04,071 --> 00:47:05,072
Got it.

683
00:47:06,323 --> 00:47:07,157
Now shoo.

684
00:47:08,158 --> 00:47:09,451
Is there anything else you need?

685
00:47:09,535 --> 00:47:12,329
All in good time. Now shoo!

686
00:47:17,084 --> 00:47:18,293
You're back.

687
00:47:20,295 --> 00:47:21,338
Hello.

688
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:24,633
Is everything quiet?

689
00:47:24,716 --> 00:47:26,593
Yes, all seems well for now.

690
00:47:26,677 --> 00:47:28,595
What an ugly sight.

691
00:47:28,679 --> 00:47:30,430
Look at what they've done to the park.

692
00:47:30,514 --> 00:47:33,016
Take them down
before they attract the homeless.

693
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:35,227
-Don't wait for them to move out.
-Got it, sir.

694
00:47:35,310 --> 00:47:36,144
Why?

695
00:47:36,812 --> 00:47:37,980
What do you mean, "why?"

696
00:47:38,063 --> 00:47:40,232
Should we sit idly by
and let this continue?

697
00:47:40,315 --> 00:47:41,400
The complaints will pile on.

698
00:47:41,483 --> 00:47:43,068
"Do the police

699
00:47:43,151 --> 00:47:45,571
think it's more urgent
to kick out the homeless

700
00:47:45,654 --> 00:47:48,198
rather than to capture scammers?"

701
00:47:49,575 --> 00:47:51,910
That's what the ger architect asked.

702
00:47:51,994 --> 00:47:53,078
The architect?

703
00:47:53,787 --> 00:47:54,871
Are you being serious?

704
00:47:54,955 --> 00:47:56,582
We should arrest the scammer first

705
00:47:56,665 --> 00:47:59,626
to show the law protects people
before insisting they follow it.

706
00:48:00,210 --> 00:48:03,005
Telling them to follow the law
without protecting their rights

707
00:48:03,088 --> 00:48:06,133
makes the police just as bad
as the scammers out there.

708
00:48:06,216 --> 00:48:07,426
What's with you?

709
00:48:08,093 --> 00:48:09,219
Whose side are you on?

710
00:48:09,303 --> 00:48:11,513
Taking sides? Please.

711
00:48:12,055 --> 00:48:13,307
If I must label it,

712
00:48:13,390 --> 00:48:16,184
I'm an errand boy of the people
who sides with the innocent.

713
00:48:16,977 --> 00:48:18,520
I believe our priority should be

714
00:48:18,604 --> 00:48:21,148
to help a citizen
who was scammed out of a place to stay.

715
00:48:22,649 --> 00:48:24,776
I'll clock out for the day then.

716
00:48:55,307 --> 00:48:56,266
Hey, it's me.

717
00:48:56,350 --> 00:48:59,144
It's about what I requested
regarding the missing daughter.

718
00:49:00,312 --> 00:49:04,191
Can you get me a list of girls
who went missing between 2006 and 2023?

719
00:49:06,193 --> 00:49:07,819
She was lost in Mongolia,

720
00:49:07,903 --> 00:49:10,113
so the list will be short
if narrowed down to international cases.

721
00:49:11,531 --> 00:49:13,408
Thanks again. I'll wait for your call.

722
00:49:13,492 --> 00:49:14,409
Goodbye.

723
00:49:59,413 --> 00:50:01,915
Look at him throwing a party for himself.

724
00:50:02,708 --> 00:50:04,126
I'm not sure what he achieved

725
00:50:04,209 --> 00:50:06,420
to get him dancing like that
in his undies.

726
00:50:29,025 --> 00:50:31,278
Hey, lovebirds. Rise and shine.

727
00:50:34,573 --> 00:50:36,992
-Hey!
-We're already awake.

728
00:50:38,577 --> 00:50:40,662
The early bird catches the worm.

729
00:50:41,538 --> 00:50:43,749
Let's go. We must hustle to get breakfast.

730
00:50:44,249 --> 00:50:46,251
The line will only get longer with time.

731
00:50:49,129 --> 00:50:50,714
You're diligent for a vagrant.

732
00:50:50,797 --> 00:50:53,091
I didn't become a vagrant
because I was lazy.

733
00:50:53,175 --> 00:50:54,676
It's because I was unlucky.

734
00:51:08,398 --> 00:51:10,192
Who parked their car like this?

735
00:51:22,579 --> 00:51:23,622
Hello?

736
00:51:24,122 --> 00:51:26,583
I'm calling
from the Golden Imperial parking lot.

737
00:51:26,666 --> 00:51:28,502
You need to move your car.

738
00:51:28,585 --> 00:51:30,796
Damn it. I was sleeping.

739
00:51:30,879 --> 00:51:32,756
Push it or something. Do it yourself.

740
00:51:37,302 --> 00:51:39,387
You don't mind if your tires get damaged?

741
00:51:39,471 --> 00:51:43,308
For crying out loud.
Stop bothering me, you old hag.

742
00:51:43,809 --> 00:51:45,060
Hey, Granny.

743
00:51:45,143 --> 00:51:47,771
If you're old, don't bother going out.

744
00:51:47,854 --> 00:51:50,690
Just stay home and watch
your grandkids or something, got it?

745
00:51:50,774 --> 00:51:52,400
I'm busy as it is.

746
00:51:52,484 --> 00:51:54,736
Is this freaking bastard
being serious right now?

747
00:51:54,820 --> 00:51:56,446
I could just snap your neck.

748
00:52:24,099 --> 00:52:27,227
That wouldn't be enough
to teach that little jerk a lesson.

749
00:52:27,310 --> 00:52:28,812
What was that?

750
00:52:29,396 --> 00:52:31,398
I can't understand a word you're saying.

751
00:52:31,481 --> 00:52:32,649
Whatever, I'm hanging up.

752
00:52:35,610 --> 00:52:36,820
Where's my car?

753
00:52:36,903 --> 00:52:39,489
Damn it. Where did I put it?

754
00:52:43,952 --> 00:52:44,953
Is that it?

755
00:52:45,704 --> 00:52:47,205
I think it is. Is it?

756
00:52:48,081 --> 00:52:49,207
My baby!

757
00:52:50,083 --> 00:52:51,501
Why are you lying upside down?

758
00:52:51,585 --> 00:52:54,170
I've only paid off
three months of installments!

759
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:09,603
The Heritage Club requires
a certain dress code, ma'am.

760
00:53:09,686 --> 00:53:11,521
If they want matching attire,

761
00:53:12,188 --> 00:53:13,607
they should wear school uniforms.

762
00:53:13,690 --> 00:53:15,483
One must be at the top of the pyramid

763
00:53:15,567 --> 00:53:17,569
to flip it upside down.

764
00:53:17,652 --> 00:53:19,154
You said it yourself

765
00:53:19,237 --> 00:53:22,073
that you had to be among the elite
to change the world.

766
00:53:22,157 --> 00:53:23,241
That's right.

767
00:53:24,451 --> 00:53:27,913
I said I'll make the world
a better place with what I have.

768
00:53:27,996 --> 00:53:28,914
Yes.

769
00:53:29,456 --> 00:53:33,293
You also said it was for Nam-soon's sake.

770
00:53:33,376 --> 00:53:34,336
That's right.

771
00:53:37,213 --> 00:53:39,633
Did you look into Hwa-ja?

772
00:53:44,679 --> 00:53:45,513
Yes, ma'am.

773
00:53:46,723 --> 00:53:47,891
Tell me.

774
00:53:49,643 --> 00:53:50,644
She…

775
00:53:51,227 --> 00:53:52,354
isn't your daughter.

776
00:53:55,023 --> 00:53:56,733
Would you like the recording?

777
00:53:59,444 --> 00:54:00,403
No.

778
00:54:02,864 --> 00:54:03,990
I'd rather not hear it.

779
00:54:05,116 --> 00:54:07,369
How should I deal with her?

780
00:54:12,499 --> 00:54:13,500
For now,

781
00:54:14,918 --> 00:54:16,169
observe quietly.

782
00:54:18,380 --> 00:54:20,757
Please don't be too disappointed, ma'am.

783
00:54:21,591 --> 00:54:24,386
I'm sure you'll find your daughter.

784
00:54:27,055 --> 00:54:28,098
My daughter

785
00:54:29,391 --> 00:54:30,892
is currently in Korea.

786
00:54:31,726 --> 00:54:33,353
She's somewhere close.

787
00:54:35,021 --> 00:54:36,648
I can feel it.

788
00:54:51,121 --> 00:54:53,039
Mother, are you heading out today?

789
00:54:53,832 --> 00:54:54,666
Yes.

790
00:54:57,293 --> 00:54:58,378
Then…

791
00:54:58,461 --> 00:55:02,298
would it be all right
to have some friends over today?

792
00:55:08,263 --> 00:55:09,264
Sure.

793
00:55:10,348 --> 00:55:11,433
Have fun.

794
00:55:26,614 --> 00:55:28,199
ARABESQUE CROWN TOP LUXURY PARK MANSION

795
00:55:30,410 --> 00:55:31,453
Hey.

796
00:55:31,536 --> 00:55:33,955
I'm heading out on a call.

797
00:55:34,039 --> 00:55:34,914
I didn't ask.

798
00:55:37,542 --> 00:55:38,793
Here. You can use this.

799
00:55:38,877 --> 00:55:40,879
It's my personal phone. Take it for now.

800
00:55:41,588 --> 00:55:43,381
You shouldn't have…

801
00:55:43,465 --> 00:55:45,175
is what you thought I'd say, right?

802
00:55:45,258 --> 00:55:46,593
Nope. I'm taking it.

803
00:55:48,219 --> 00:55:50,430
My number's on speed dial one, so call me.

804
00:55:50,513 --> 00:55:52,015
Sure. Thanks, kiddo.

805
00:55:53,391 --> 00:55:56,227
Learning Korean from an old lady
made you sound like one.

806
00:55:56,311 --> 00:55:58,521
What are you grumbling about, kiddo?

807
00:55:58,605 --> 00:55:59,814
Head off to work already.

808
00:55:59,898 --> 00:56:02,400
Catch the person who scammed me
and find my mom.

809
00:56:03,026 --> 00:56:05,737
You seem too at ease for a cop.

810
00:56:05,820 --> 00:56:06,988
Now shoo.

811
00:56:07,072 --> 00:56:08,323
Yes, ma'am.

812
00:56:09,741 --> 00:56:12,619
I saw you drinking Pangtao beer.

813
00:56:12,702 --> 00:56:13,953
You were dancing too.

814
00:56:14,621 --> 00:56:15,455
What?

815
00:56:16,164 --> 00:56:18,416
In neon undies of all things.

816
00:56:19,542 --> 00:56:22,587
I'm too busy today
to keep talking with you.

817
00:56:23,088 --> 00:56:24,464
-Come back tomorrow.
-Why should I?

818
00:56:24,547 --> 00:56:25,882
We have to go to the embassy.

819
00:56:28,468 --> 00:56:29,636
-Let's go.
-Let's move.

820
00:56:31,429 --> 00:56:33,139
What's with her shameless confidence?

821
00:56:35,183 --> 00:56:36,309
Wait, neon undies?

822
00:56:36,392 --> 00:56:37,560
How did she see me last night?

823
00:56:38,978 --> 00:56:40,146
Who is this woman?

824
00:57:17,308 --> 00:57:19,853
I made it this far on my own two feet,

825
00:57:19,936 --> 00:57:22,313
which makes them quite valuable.

826
00:57:22,397 --> 00:57:24,524
I couldn't let them sit in any old shoes.

827
00:57:24,607 --> 00:57:26,192
If you say so.

828
00:57:26,693 --> 00:57:30,321
To make it wherever you want,
one's feet must be comfortable.

829
00:57:31,072 --> 00:57:31,948
Then,

830
00:57:32,031 --> 00:57:34,576
let us raise our glasses
to celebrate our newest member.

831
00:57:34,659 --> 00:57:36,244
Please welcome

832
00:57:36,327 --> 00:57:38,371
the newest member of our club,
Ms. Hwang Geum-ju.

833
00:57:38,455 --> 00:57:40,540
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

834
00:57:41,249 --> 00:57:42,208
How about a toast?

835
00:57:42,292 --> 00:57:43,251
Me?

836
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:44,794
Yes.

837
00:57:52,719 --> 00:57:56,222
I hope for a world that is livable
not only for those with money

838
00:57:56,848 --> 00:57:59,517
but also for everyone else in this world.

839
00:58:00,602 --> 00:58:01,436
Cheers.

840
00:58:04,314 --> 00:58:05,273
There's no such world.

841
00:58:05,356 --> 00:58:07,692
You must be feisty
because you're new here.

842
00:58:09,277 --> 00:58:10,278
Give it your best.

843
00:58:10,361 --> 00:58:13,323
But the world will never change.

844
00:58:16,868 --> 00:58:18,328
I'm willing to give it a shot.

845
00:58:20,580 --> 00:58:21,414
So just watch.

846
00:58:22,874 --> 00:58:25,210
It seems to be something you're good at,

847
00:58:26,586 --> 00:58:30,548
seeing how you've been completely occupied
with watching that lady over there.

848
00:58:31,090 --> 00:58:32,300
I saw it all.

849
00:58:38,681 --> 00:58:41,267
Excuse me. I must leave, everyone.

850
00:59:58,511 --> 00:59:59,429
You're in the wrong place.

851
01:00:00,638 --> 01:00:03,308
Go here if you wish to change the world.

852
01:00:03,391 --> 01:00:04,392
This is the place

853
01:00:04,892 --> 01:00:07,353
that only grants access to special people.

854
01:00:18,615 --> 01:00:22,285
JOB LISTINGS

855
01:00:22,368 --> 01:00:24,245
HIRING MOVIE EXTRAS

856
01:00:26,623 --> 01:00:28,875
GAN I-SIK

857
01:00:32,045 --> 01:00:32,879
Hey.

858
01:00:33,463 --> 01:00:34,839
Ninety-eight.

859
01:00:35,798 --> 01:00:36,966
You'll need a photo

860
01:00:37,050 --> 01:00:38,968
for your passport tomorrow.
Did you take it?

861
01:00:39,052 --> 01:00:40,887
Okay, I'll go and get one.

862
01:00:42,680 --> 01:00:44,098
When you do…

863
01:00:44,182 --> 01:00:45,141
Hello?

864
01:00:48,936 --> 01:00:51,564
For some reason,
I feel like I'm being dragged around.

865
01:00:54,359 --> 01:00:55,693
It's not too bad though.

866
01:01:00,114 --> 01:01:01,616
Careful not to crap yourself.

867
01:01:10,083 --> 01:01:11,751
BONG PHOTO GALLERY

868
01:01:12,335 --> 01:01:13,211
Wait.

869
01:01:13,294 --> 01:01:15,755
On Wednesdays, we close at 6 p.m.

870
01:01:16,839 --> 01:01:19,467
But I need a passport photo.

871
01:01:20,301 --> 01:01:21,469
I'm sorry.

872
01:01:22,387 --> 01:01:23,638
I guess I have no choice.

873
01:01:24,222 --> 01:01:25,932
I'll take it someplace else.

874
01:01:26,641 --> 01:01:28,810
You shouldn't address elders
so informally…

875
01:01:31,729 --> 01:01:32,563
Hang on.

876
01:02:37,420 --> 01:02:39,756
STRONG GIRL NAM-SOON

877
01:02:39,839 --> 01:02:42,800
The drug was smuggled
in one of her possessions.

878
01:02:42,884 --> 01:02:44,761
It was disguised as something
we could never think of.

879
01:02:44,844 --> 01:02:46,304
It seems like a synthetic drug.

880
01:02:46,387 --> 01:02:47,513
This drug could be terrifying.

881
01:02:47,597 --> 01:02:48,681
Either way, I'm eating that.

882
01:02:48,765 --> 01:02:50,349
-Do you want to get fired?
-No, but maybe you do!

883
01:02:50,433 --> 01:02:52,518
Give me a tarot reading
on Nam-soon's whereabouts.

884
01:02:52,602 --> 01:02:55,313
Like destiny,
a savior will come to the rescue.

885
01:02:55,396 --> 01:02:56,773
She's coming our way.

886
01:02:56,856 --> 01:02:59,150
I hear you're looking for your daughter.
Is it true that you found her?

887
01:02:59,233 --> 01:03:02,361
Get me everything on a police officer
by the name of Kang Hee-sik and fast.

888
01:03:02,445 --> 01:03:03,738
I've changed my mind.

889
01:03:03,821 --> 01:03:05,448
I'm staying as her daughter.

890
01:03:05,531 --> 01:03:07,033
What do you think you're doing?

891
01:03:07,700 --> 01:03:10,369
You'll pay for this.

892
01:03:12,705 --> 01:03:17,710
