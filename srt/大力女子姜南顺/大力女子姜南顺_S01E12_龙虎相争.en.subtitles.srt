1
00:00:42,667 --> 00:00:45,962
STRONG GIRL NAM-SOON

2
00:00:50,967 --> 00:00:52,135
Si-o, it's me.

3
00:00:55,096 --> 00:00:56,848
I'm sorry I couldn't call you back.

4
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:09,944
Si-o?

5
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:01,913
Are you okay?

6
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:04,082
Don't come any closer.

7
00:02:13,383 --> 00:02:14,259
Si-o.

8
00:02:35,405 --> 00:02:36,406
Did Beom send you?

9
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:38,449
She wants a sample of the antidote.

10
00:02:44,706 --> 00:02:46,166
-No.
-What?

11
00:02:46,249 --> 00:02:47,417
Tell her

12
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:50,128
that the antidote is mine.

13
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:52,547
I own that business.

14
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:56,009
Pavel isn't to interfere.

15
00:02:56,092 --> 00:02:56,926
What?

16
00:02:58,928 --> 00:03:00,221
Anton!

17
00:03:00,305 --> 00:03:01,514
The antidote is mine.

18
00:03:02,098 --> 00:03:03,224
No one else can have it.

19
00:03:03,308 --> 00:03:05,101
Not you or Pavel.

20
00:03:30,835 --> 00:03:31,878
As for Nozh,

21
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:33,838
do you know what they look like?

22
00:03:35,423 --> 00:03:36,257
No.

23
00:03:37,175 --> 00:03:38,009
Then,

24
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:40,595
how do you know they're in Korea?

25
00:03:40,678 --> 00:03:42,597
We've been tracking Pavel for a long time.

26
00:03:43,097 --> 00:03:44,891
They execute traitors instantaneously.

27
00:03:45,558 --> 00:03:48,353
The organization does not tolerate
information being leaked.

28
00:03:48,436 --> 00:03:49,354
However,

29
00:03:49,854 --> 00:03:52,774
they encrypt their messages
with the complicated Enigma machine.

30
00:03:53,358 --> 00:03:55,777
And our agent just cracked their message.

31
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:57,570
One that says Nozh is in Korea.

32
00:03:58,529 --> 00:04:01,032
They probably have their eyes on you.

33
00:04:01,824 --> 00:04:02,951
If they want to play,

34
00:04:03,826 --> 00:04:05,370
let them.

35
00:04:05,453 --> 00:04:07,205
You must be careful at all times.

36
00:04:07,789 --> 00:04:09,040
If you need a gun,

37
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:11,793
please let me know.

38
00:04:22,053 --> 00:04:23,137
Mr. Shin Gang-su

39
00:04:23,888 --> 00:04:24,931
is dead.

40
00:04:31,312 --> 00:04:35,650
EPISODE 12
DIAMOND CUTS DIAMOND

41
00:04:48,997 --> 00:04:50,623
-Sir.
-What happened?

42
00:04:51,165 --> 00:04:53,293
The witness said
he started having seizures

43
00:04:53,376 --> 00:04:55,169
after drinking from that vial.

44
00:04:55,253 --> 00:04:56,462
He must've lost hope

45
00:04:56,546 --> 00:04:57,964
after meeting with his lawyer.

46
00:04:58,047 --> 00:04:59,841
-His lawyer?
-Yes.

47
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:04,512
Start with an autopsy.

48
00:05:04,595 --> 00:05:06,848
And give me the lawyer's info.

49
00:05:06,931 --> 00:05:08,141
Shin Gang-su…

50
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:10,893
didn't kill himself.

51
00:05:42,884 --> 00:05:44,135
This is the antidote.

52
00:05:44,218 --> 00:05:45,887
It's the same as what Nam-in drank.

53
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:47,055
Hairtail is dead.

54
00:05:47,722 --> 00:05:49,015
We no longer have a witness.

55
00:05:49,098 --> 00:05:49,932
What?

56
00:05:54,645 --> 00:05:56,314
Then submit my watch as evidence.

57
00:05:56,397 --> 00:05:58,274
It recorded me
stealing that puffer jacket.

58
00:05:58,357 --> 00:05:59,817
No, I won't do that.

59
00:05:59,901 --> 00:06:01,402
It'll put you in danger.

60
00:06:04,363 --> 00:06:05,198
Hello?

61
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:07,325
Hairtail has been taken care of.

62
00:06:48,324 --> 00:06:49,700
Have lunch with me today.

63
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:52,495
I booked us a table at a nice bistro.

64
00:06:52,578 --> 00:06:54,288
You seem to be in a good mood.

65
00:06:54,372 --> 00:06:55,957
A problem has been handled.

66
00:06:56,749 --> 00:06:58,835
Once Hwang Geum-ju dies,

67
00:06:59,877 --> 00:07:01,254
everything will be perfect.

68
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:17,520
She's here.

69
00:07:18,354 --> 00:07:19,480
It's as we expected.

70
00:07:20,022 --> 00:07:23,276
Will my stand-in be all right?

71
00:07:56,601 --> 00:07:58,853
She's a former agent
of the National Intelligence Service

72
00:07:58,936 --> 00:08:01,647
who's highly accomplished
in taekwondo, hapkido, and kendo.

73
00:08:40,561 --> 00:08:41,604
Tell them

74
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:43,856
that Hwang Geum-ju

75
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,900
is alive.

76
00:09:10,758 --> 00:09:11,759
Tsetseg.

77
00:09:12,468 --> 00:09:13,803
Do you want to be friends?

78
00:09:14,512 --> 00:09:16,305
Friends, my foot.

79
00:09:17,265 --> 00:09:18,432
Friends?

80
00:09:18,516 --> 00:09:21,269
Of course. I'd love that.

81
00:09:23,479 --> 00:09:25,106
But what do you think friends are?

82
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,944
Someone who will protect me

83
00:09:30,027 --> 00:09:31,279
and take my side

84
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:33,656
even after knowing my secrets.

85
00:09:37,868 --> 00:09:38,953
I once had…

86
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,248
a friend like that.

87
00:09:43,457 --> 00:09:44,792
We lost touch when I was ten.

88
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:47,670
Was your friend Russian?

89
00:09:48,504 --> 00:09:50,214
I met him in Russia,

90
00:09:51,048 --> 00:09:52,216
but he wasn't Russian.

91
00:09:53,175 --> 00:09:54,760
We were in the same position

92
00:09:55,344 --> 00:09:57,096
but made different choices.

93
00:09:58,723 --> 00:10:00,683
I don't know where he is
or what he's doing.

94
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:05,146
When it comes to love or friendship,

95
00:10:06,647 --> 00:10:07,940
I'm still new to both.

96
00:10:09,525 --> 00:10:11,902
Those weren't options for me
in the life I've led.

97
00:10:14,905 --> 00:10:16,282
But when I'm with you,

98
00:10:17,491 --> 00:10:18,492
friendship…

99
00:10:19,702 --> 00:10:20,703
and love…

100
00:10:22,246 --> 00:10:23,497
pique my interest.

101
00:10:31,714 --> 00:10:33,215
You're getting a call.

102
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:43,184
Hey.

103
00:10:43,267 --> 00:10:45,811
Hwang Geum-ju played us.

104
00:10:46,604 --> 00:10:49,607
The patient in the hospital was a fake!

105
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:52,401
So what happened?

106
00:10:53,944 --> 00:10:55,029
You didn't…

107
00:10:57,323 --> 00:10:58,324
get rid of her?

108
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:08,959
What is it?

109
00:11:09,043 --> 00:11:11,045
I shouldn't have let her live.

110
00:11:11,545 --> 00:11:12,838
Hwang Geum-ju.

111
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:15,257
She's such a pain.

112
00:11:26,268 --> 00:11:27,978
-Sit here for a moment.
-Okay.

113
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,156
Enter.

114
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:53,170
Gather the boys and meet up with Sun-bae.

115
00:11:53,254 --> 00:11:58,217
You'll surveil Hwang Geum-ju
as soon as Mr. Yoon hands over her file.

116
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:01,011
Geumju TV, Geumju Hospital, and Gold Blue.

117
00:12:01,095 --> 00:12:02,930
Tail her family as well.

118
00:12:03,013 --> 00:12:04,056
Yes, sir.

119
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:16,277
Hwang Geum-ju.

120
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:20,614
I need to find her daughter.

121
00:12:22,867 --> 00:12:24,493
How are you going to do that?

122
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:26,412
Normally, if a mother is hospitalized,

123
00:12:27,496 --> 00:12:29,039
her daughter would pay a visit.

124
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:32,209
But she never did.

125
00:12:33,502 --> 00:12:35,379
It means that she also knew

126
00:12:36,046 --> 00:12:37,840
that the patient was a stand-in.

127
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:40,426
There's a good chance

128
00:12:40,509 --> 00:12:43,053
she's operating with Hwang Geum-ju.

129
00:12:45,723 --> 00:12:46,682
So?

130
00:12:47,391 --> 00:12:50,102
Are you thinking of killing them both?

131
00:12:50,686 --> 00:12:52,229
I bet you ate a lot of lamb in Mongolia.

132
00:12:55,065 --> 00:12:57,818
To me, there's no difference
between the lamb you ate

133
00:12:58,944 --> 00:13:00,237
and Hwang Geum-ju.

134
00:13:01,906 --> 00:13:03,657
She needs to die.

135
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:06,368
And all of them with her.

136
00:13:14,251 --> 00:13:17,087
The lawyer's license
turned out to be forged.

137
00:13:17,171 --> 00:13:19,715
He impersonated a registered lawyer
who shared his name.

138
00:13:19,798 --> 00:13:20,841
LIST OF REGISTERED LAWYERS

139
00:13:29,558 --> 00:13:30,518
Hello?

140
00:13:30,601 --> 00:13:32,811
Madam Kim paid me a visit at the hospital.

141
00:13:32,895 --> 00:13:34,188
While trying to kill me,

142
00:13:34,688 --> 00:13:36,815
she found out about my stand-in.

143
00:13:45,574 --> 00:13:47,952
That's the location of the woman
who sold me the antidote.

144
00:13:48,869 --> 00:13:52,623
But arresting her without a plan
could ruin everything.

145
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:54,792
Even if we arrest her
for attempted murder,

146
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:57,044
she'll be forced to commit suicide
like Shin Gang-su.

147
00:13:57,127 --> 00:13:59,964
We need to find someone from their circle

148
00:14:01,257 --> 00:14:02,967
who they wouldn't care about.

149
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:04,009
Right.

150
00:14:05,928 --> 00:14:07,179
I have the location.

151
00:14:24,822 --> 00:14:25,739
Hey.

152
00:14:26,615 --> 00:14:28,284
Hairtail's lawyer turned out to be fake.

153
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:30,661
-What?
-What does that mean?

154
00:14:30,744 --> 00:14:32,204
I think it was a forced suicide.

155
00:15:09,992 --> 00:15:10,951
Ms. Han Min-jung,

156
00:15:11,619 --> 00:15:13,871
you're under arrest
for violating the Narcotics Control Act.

157
00:15:13,954 --> 00:15:14,830
What?

158
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:16,498
You're a cop?

159
00:15:17,374 --> 00:15:18,250
What else?

160
00:15:18,834 --> 00:15:21,128
Did you think Heritage Club sent someone

161
00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:23,130
because you ran off with the money?

162
00:15:40,022 --> 00:15:40,940
Hello?

163
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:43,609
Hairtail's being autopsied,
so meet me there.

164
00:15:45,819 --> 00:15:46,862
Hairtail…

165
00:15:47,821 --> 00:15:48,739
is dead?

166
00:15:49,365 --> 00:15:50,449
Yes.

167
00:15:50,532 --> 00:15:52,743
How could he have died while in custody?

168
00:15:52,826 --> 00:15:55,412
Run, and you'll be killed
by those bastards in no time.

169
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:57,831
So what will it be?

170
00:15:58,332 --> 00:16:01,418
Being in police custody
is the best way to stay alive.

171
00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:03,796
And don't even think about
hiring a lawyer.

172
00:16:04,546 --> 00:16:05,798
That's how Hairtail died.

173
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:12,596
This is Kang Hee-sik of the DIU.

174
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,515
Requesting a suspect's car
to be taken into custody.

175
00:16:25,109 --> 00:16:26,652
I don't know anything though.

176
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:29,488
I only followed Madam Kim's orders.

177
00:16:29,571 --> 00:16:31,657
I wonder what she ordered you to do.

178
00:16:34,451 --> 00:16:35,869
Hairtail was forced to kill himself,

179
00:16:35,953 --> 00:16:37,746
just like Baldy.

180
00:16:39,373 --> 00:16:41,583
I doubt you want to die too.

181
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:45,754
Here.

182
00:16:47,589 --> 00:16:50,217
Acute heart failure
from an overdose of indenol.

183
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:52,094
-He died of a heart attack.
-Indenol?

184
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:54,096
It's usually taken for stage fright.

185
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:55,723
It's usually taken in pill form,

186
00:16:55,806 --> 00:16:58,058
so taking it in liquid form
is practically suicide.

187
00:16:58,142 --> 00:16:59,059
I see.

188
00:16:59,143 --> 00:17:00,686
Ryu Si-o must've sent someone.

189
00:17:00,769 --> 00:17:03,605
The consultation room isn't equipped
with a camera or a listening device.

190
00:17:04,356 --> 00:17:06,775
That's how they gave Hairtail the vial.

191
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:07,860
Hold on.

192
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:10,487
What did they say
to make him kill himself?

193
00:17:11,822 --> 00:17:13,699
Pavel isn't like any other mafia group.

194
00:17:14,783 --> 00:17:16,285
It's an intelligent organization.

195
00:17:19,455 --> 00:17:21,832
COMMISSIONER GENERAL AN BYEONG-HO

196
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:26,879
Ryu Si-o must be caught
to eradicate this drug.

197
00:17:30,007 --> 00:17:31,967
SPECIAL INVESTIGATION TEAM
PROSECUTOR JANG HYE-MI

198
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:34,136
LOCATION: DOOGO HEADQUARTERS

199
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:36,013
SEARCH AND SEIZURE WARRANT

200
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:40,642
PAVEL
RYU SI-O

201
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:43,062
Mr. Ryu is a mobster?

202
00:17:46,023 --> 00:17:47,649
Unbelievable.

203
00:17:58,744 --> 00:18:02,414
Prosecutor Moon,
this is Commissioner General An.

204
00:18:28,148 --> 00:18:30,234
You seemed tired, so I didn't wake you.

205
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:32,694
You should head home.

206
00:18:34,571 --> 00:18:35,405
You're getting a call.

207
00:18:52,422 --> 00:18:54,508
Did you locate the missing puffer jacket?

208
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:55,425
Not yet.

209
00:18:56,844 --> 00:18:58,554
So you'd rather die?

210
00:18:58,637 --> 00:19:00,013
The police found out.

211
00:19:00,681 --> 00:19:02,516
Do you call this doing your job?

212
00:19:02,599 --> 00:19:03,851
If things go south…

213
00:19:04,476 --> 00:19:06,562
You'll have me killed?

214
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:07,646
Anton.

215
00:19:07,729 --> 00:19:10,107
I'm Ryu Si-o, not Anton!

216
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:15,320
And you are done ordering me around.

217
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:46,393
Are you okay?

218
00:19:52,566 --> 00:19:53,609
Who was that?

219
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:56,236
You got furious and then laughed
like a crazy person.

220
00:19:59,781 --> 00:20:00,824
Tsetseg.

221
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:03,285
Have you ever
rebelled against your parents?

222
00:20:05,287 --> 00:20:07,456
Were you on the phone with yours?

223
00:20:08,081 --> 00:20:09,583
You said you didn't have parents.

224
00:20:10,334 --> 00:20:11,293
You're right.

225
00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:13,337
I don't.

226
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:15,088
Then who was that?

227
00:20:16,298 --> 00:20:17,299
And who's Anton?

228
00:20:28,685 --> 00:20:30,854
Anton is my Russian name.

229
00:20:32,773 --> 00:20:34,107
No matter what,

230
00:20:37,945 --> 00:20:39,071
you must be by my side.

231
00:20:43,825 --> 00:20:45,577
He had a gastroscopy,

232
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:49,581
and his doctor had never seen
such a clean stomach before.

233
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:52,167
It could've even been passed off
as a newborn's stomach.

234
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:53,585
That's how my son is.

235
00:20:54,169 --> 00:20:57,172
His organs couldn't possibly be cleaner,

236
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:59,258
kidneys and gall bladder included.

237
00:21:01,343 --> 00:21:04,054
I'm glad he at least has healthy organs.

238
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:07,391
Then should I brew
the same tonic as before?

239
00:21:07,474 --> 00:21:08,934
Yes, of course.

240
00:21:09,017 --> 00:21:11,645
Add even better ingredients if you can.

241
00:21:15,065 --> 00:21:16,984
His sister is rich, you know.

242
00:21:17,067 --> 00:21:18,860
Obscenely so.

243
00:21:19,361 --> 00:21:21,196
It's why he has

244
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:24,032
an eight-story building in Seocho-dong
in his name.

245
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:26,034
It'd be perfect to have
a traditional medicine clinic

246
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:28,495
after kicking the first-floor café out.

247
00:21:28,578 --> 00:21:31,581
You can't drive out tenants
that easily these days.

248
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:35,168
You just can't take a hint, can you?

249
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:40,590
What I'm saying is

250
00:21:41,341 --> 00:21:42,968
that I'd like for us

251
00:21:43,593 --> 00:21:46,596
to have a familial relationship.

252
00:21:47,222 --> 00:21:48,181
Goodness.

253
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:50,225
Ma'am, what…

254
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:51,727
As newlyweds,

255
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:54,896
you can live in a 60-pyeong
apartment unit in Apgujeong.

256
00:21:57,858 --> 00:21:58,859
Don't tell me

257
00:21:59,443 --> 00:22:01,236
you already have a boyfriend.

258
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:02,863
I don't.

259
00:22:02,946 --> 00:22:03,905
Excellent.

260
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,077
Goodness.

261
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:11,121
You're perfect for him.

262
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:26,470
Ryu Si-o is coming after my family.

263
00:22:26,553 --> 00:22:28,096
Let's go to my place.

264
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:29,014
Stay with me.

265
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:30,974
What?

266
00:22:31,808 --> 00:22:33,727
I have to stay home and protect my family.

267
00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:36,521
If you stay there,
you'll be putting them in danger,

268
00:22:36,605 --> 00:22:38,065
not protecting them.

269
00:22:38,148 --> 00:22:39,483
Ryu Si-o, that bastard…

270
00:22:41,777 --> 00:22:44,112
He thinks you live at my place anyway.

271
00:22:45,489 --> 00:22:46,740
Damn it.

272
00:22:48,658 --> 00:22:50,410
I hoped to be the one
to ask you to move in.

273
00:22:50,494 --> 00:22:51,328
What?

274
00:22:53,622 --> 00:22:55,791
Ryu Si-o has been opening up to me.

275
00:22:55,874 --> 00:22:57,626
So? Do you like that?

276
00:22:57,709 --> 00:22:59,711
That's no way to talk to someone
who's been working hard.

277
00:22:59,795 --> 00:23:00,796
You…

278
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:03,715
It looked like
you'd gladly fall into his arms.

279
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:04,758
Gan I-sik, that's--

280
00:23:04,841 --> 00:23:07,344
You should've used your strength
to push him away.

281
00:23:10,597 --> 00:23:12,849
You're jealous, aren't you?

282
00:23:12,933 --> 00:23:15,102
This isn't jealousy. I'm educating you.

283
00:23:15,185 --> 00:23:17,395
Even espionage has its boundaries.

284
00:23:17,479 --> 00:23:21,316
My first time will be with the man I love.

285
00:23:21,858 --> 00:23:22,692
Your first time?

286
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:25,445
It's a family tradition.

287
00:23:26,363 --> 00:23:28,740
Our first time should be
with the man we love

288
00:23:28,824 --> 00:23:30,450
to have a healthy daughter.

289
00:23:32,327 --> 00:23:35,580
There's no need to get so carried away.

290
00:23:36,414 --> 00:23:37,541
What do you mean?

291
00:23:37,624 --> 00:23:39,417
I was just answering your question.

292
00:23:41,419 --> 00:23:42,295
You got flustered.

293
00:23:42,379 --> 00:23:43,255
No, I didn't.

294
00:23:43,338 --> 00:23:44,214
Yes, you did.

295
00:23:44,297 --> 00:23:45,215
What…

296
00:23:46,174 --> 00:23:47,634
Your seat belt.

297
00:23:48,218 --> 00:23:49,261
There.

298
00:23:51,721 --> 00:23:53,849
Let's go to your place.

299
00:23:53,932 --> 00:23:55,851
Off we go!

300
00:24:12,492 --> 00:24:13,326
Ms. Jung,

301
00:24:13,952 --> 00:24:15,787
stay at Geumju Hotel for the time being.

302
00:24:16,788 --> 00:24:18,165
You can't stay at this house.

303
00:24:18,248 --> 00:24:19,457
Yes, ma'am.

304
00:24:19,541 --> 00:24:22,961
I apologize for putting you
in this tough situation.

305
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:25,255
Get yourself a security detail.

306
00:24:25,338 --> 00:24:26,882
That won't be necessary.

307
00:24:26,965 --> 00:24:29,885
I've been learning self-defense
to protect myself.

308
00:24:29,968 --> 00:24:31,136
All right.

309
00:24:39,728 --> 00:24:40,896
I had fun

310
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:43,565
delivering the news.

311
00:24:44,065 --> 00:24:45,358
Presenting the news…

312
00:24:46,693 --> 00:24:48,153
has always been a dream of mine.

313
00:24:48,236 --> 00:24:49,571
I was taken by surprise.

314
00:24:50,989 --> 00:24:52,115
You have a knack for it.

315
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:21,728
Ms. Hwang Geum-ju sent us.

316
00:25:24,022 --> 00:25:25,190
Right.

317
00:25:31,571 --> 00:25:33,323
This was sent by Ms. Hwang Geum-ju.

318
00:25:42,582 --> 00:25:43,416
Hello?

319
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:44,626
Where are you right now?

320
00:25:44,709 --> 00:25:46,419
Where else but the photo studio?

321
00:25:46,503 --> 00:25:48,463
-Inside or out?
-Outside.

322
00:25:48,546 --> 00:25:49,965
What are you doing outside?

323
00:25:50,048 --> 00:25:51,132
I'm sweeping.

324
00:25:52,133 --> 00:25:53,635
Anyway, who are these people?

325
00:25:53,718 --> 00:25:54,886
What's with all the bodyguards?

326
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:57,430
Don't clean outside after sundown!

327
00:25:58,223 --> 00:25:59,557
Close the photo studio for now.

328
00:26:00,141 --> 00:26:01,059
Put Nam-in on the phone.

329
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:06,273
Hello?

330
00:26:06,856 --> 00:26:09,484
Eat anything and everything you want.

331
00:26:09,985 --> 00:26:12,779
You're beautiful,

332
00:26:13,947 --> 00:26:15,240
chubbiness and all.

333
00:26:15,991 --> 00:26:19,035
But don't eat anything
a stranger gives you.

334
00:26:19,536 --> 00:26:21,997
That's how Snow White
almost met her maker.

335
00:26:25,041 --> 00:26:26,835
Isn't the delivery guy also a stranger?

336
00:26:27,836 --> 00:26:29,796
"Don't clean outside after sundown."

337
00:26:30,297 --> 00:26:32,674
Who does she think I am, her subordinate?

338
00:26:32,757 --> 00:26:34,926
Who made her my drill sergeant?

339
00:26:36,469 --> 00:26:38,805
Let's go inside
and have the fried chicken, Dad.

340
00:26:39,389 --> 00:26:40,265
Sure.

341
00:26:48,273 --> 00:26:49,399
Do you remember the passcode?

342
00:26:50,275 --> 00:26:52,736
Yes, it's 121208.

343
00:26:53,486 --> 00:26:54,487
Get some rest inside.

344
00:26:54,571 --> 00:26:56,364
You must be heading back to the precinct

345
00:26:56,448 --> 00:26:58,074
to get the statement
from the antidote woman.

346
00:26:58,825 --> 00:27:00,452
You sound like a DIU detective now.

347
00:27:00,535 --> 00:27:02,162
You know all our procedures.

348
00:27:02,245 --> 00:27:03,371
Right?

349
00:27:05,373 --> 00:27:08,585
I'm taking my driving test next Tuesday
for my driver's license.

350
00:27:08,668 --> 00:27:10,962
Does that mean
you passed the written exam?

351
00:27:11,546 --> 00:27:13,006
Of course.

352
00:27:13,673 --> 00:27:14,924
Gosh,

353
00:27:15,008 --> 00:27:17,510
I'm proud of you, Hillary Khan.

354
00:27:22,015 --> 00:27:23,308
Get home soon.

355
00:27:23,391 --> 00:27:25,018
I'll wait up for you.

356
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:29,731
Okay.

357
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:45,163
He only patted my hair,
but my whole body tingled.

358
00:27:47,082 --> 00:27:48,333
Have you lost your mind?

359
00:27:48,875 --> 00:27:51,044
How dare you officially register
the antidote business

360
00:27:51,127 --> 00:27:54,464
without informing
or getting permission from Pavel

361
00:27:54,547 --> 00:27:57,884
when the antidote
was developed at Doogo's research lab?

362
00:27:57,967 --> 00:27:59,427
Why should I have asked for permission

363
00:28:00,011 --> 00:28:01,554
when Pavel wasn't involved?

364
00:28:02,347 --> 00:28:03,681
I'm the one who developed it.

365
00:28:03,765 --> 00:28:04,891
If you keep this up,

366
00:28:05,558 --> 00:28:07,894
you'll get the Tsar Bomba.

367
00:28:08,978 --> 00:28:11,064
Pavel has no source of income without me.

368
00:28:12,107 --> 00:28:13,108
Pavel…

369
00:28:14,734 --> 00:28:15,985
can never kill me.

370
00:28:17,654 --> 00:28:19,697
The rich are our targets

371
00:28:19,781 --> 00:28:22,033
since they can afford the antidote.

372
00:28:22,117 --> 00:28:23,284
Where do you get it from?

373
00:28:23,368 --> 00:28:24,369
That I don't know.

374
00:28:25,578 --> 00:28:26,996
It's the truth.

375
00:28:27,872 --> 00:28:31,209
I just did as told by Madam Kim.

376
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:33,586
What I know for sure

377
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:36,965
is that Doogo controls
the antidote business.

378
00:28:37,715 --> 00:28:40,718
Will I find the list
of weight-loss pill clients on this phone?

379
00:28:41,302 --> 00:28:42,137
Yes.

380
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:43,763
How many clients do you have?

381
00:28:43,847 --> 00:28:47,058
I tended to about 100 clients,

382
00:28:47,142 --> 00:28:49,686
but if you combine the others…

383
00:28:49,769 --> 00:28:51,020
There are

384
00:28:51,646 --> 00:28:54,983
a lot of distributors across the nation
working for Madam Kim.

385
00:28:55,066 --> 00:28:56,109
Are you saying

386
00:28:56,818 --> 00:28:59,112
the pills are distributed
all over the country?

387
00:28:59,654 --> 00:29:00,488
Yes.

388
00:29:03,241 --> 00:29:04,868
The one thing I know

389
00:29:06,161 --> 00:29:09,122
is that the antidote comes from sea hares.

390
00:29:09,205 --> 00:29:10,290
Sea hares?

391
00:29:10,373 --> 00:29:11,207
Yes.

392
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,835
The blood of sea hares.

393
00:29:17,922 --> 00:29:19,340
Delivery.

394
00:29:26,014 --> 00:29:26,848
Hi, Agent Gang.

395
00:29:28,057 --> 00:29:29,476
Hee-sik sent you some clothes.

396
00:29:29,559 --> 00:29:30,393
Clothes?

397
00:29:30,935 --> 00:29:32,437
-Have a good one.
-Sure.

398
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:33,521
Bye.

399
00:29:48,703 --> 00:29:50,455
Gan I-sik, you cutie pie.

400
00:30:05,929 --> 00:30:07,555
OCTOBER 30
I RECEIVED THE DRUG FROM A DEALER…

401
00:30:08,723 --> 00:30:10,934
A DIU detective
arrested one of the dealers,

402
00:30:11,434 --> 00:30:13,728
so a search and seizure warrant
will be requested soon.

403
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:14,646
SEARCH AND SEIZURE WARRANT

404
00:30:14,729 --> 00:30:17,565
I'm told Mr. Ryu
is a member of a Russian mafia group.

405
00:30:24,155 --> 00:30:25,240
That little bastard.

406
00:30:33,623 --> 00:30:34,749
Yes, Prosecutor Moon.

407
00:30:39,546 --> 00:30:41,172
We'll talk in person.

408
00:30:46,678 --> 00:30:48,721
-Have you located her family?
-Yes.

409
00:30:48,805 --> 00:30:52,976
Her ex-husband, son, mother,
and younger brother.

410
00:30:53,518 --> 00:30:55,854
But not her daughter.

411
00:30:58,398 --> 00:31:00,233
You'll be accompanying me today.

412
00:31:00,316 --> 00:31:01,568
Where are you headed?

413
00:31:01,651 --> 00:31:02,902
The Prosecutors' Office.

414
00:31:04,779 --> 00:31:06,906
Tsetseg, I'll be running late today.

415
00:31:07,991 --> 00:31:09,117
See you in the evening.

416
00:31:14,163 --> 00:31:16,124
If he's running late,

417
00:31:16,624 --> 00:31:18,251
what can I do at the office by myself?

418
00:31:25,216 --> 00:31:26,467
Does that mean

419
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:28,845
I can also head to work late?

420
00:31:29,846 --> 00:31:31,598
That sounds about right.

421
00:31:42,859 --> 00:31:44,736
It seems like you have something to say.

422
00:31:44,819 --> 00:31:47,322
Should I take a seat or keep standing?

423
00:32:00,835 --> 00:32:01,794
Do you sell drugs?

424
00:32:03,171 --> 00:32:04,172
Yes.

425
00:32:05,048 --> 00:32:06,174
Well, look at this punk.

426
00:32:06,841 --> 00:32:08,259
Are you really in the mafia?

427
00:32:09,886 --> 00:32:10,762
Yes.

428
00:32:13,973 --> 00:32:17,060
It seems like just because
I've played poker with you a few times,

429
00:32:17,143 --> 00:32:18,269
you think we're buddies.

430
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:20,188
You damn bastard.

431
00:32:20,271 --> 00:32:22,106
Do you think prosecutors are a joke?

432
00:32:22,690 --> 00:32:24,692
Don't you know I specialize in drug cases?

433
00:32:25,902 --> 00:32:27,195
You little…

434
00:32:29,614 --> 00:32:31,824
You're done for, you little brat!

435
00:32:32,408 --> 00:32:33,576
Name, Moon Seong-u.

436
00:32:34,202 --> 00:32:37,205
You started out at Seoul Eastern District
Prosecutors' Office in 2003,

437
00:32:37,288 --> 00:32:40,124
transferred to
the Chuncheon Office in 2007,

438
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:42,794
and then to the Suwon Office in 2009.

439
00:32:43,711 --> 00:32:46,089
You became a prosecution research officer
at the SPO in 2013

440
00:32:46,172 --> 00:32:48,633
and a prosecutor at Seoul Central
District Prosecutors' Office in 2015.

441
00:32:48,716 --> 00:32:49,717
And now,

442
00:32:49,801 --> 00:32:51,803
you're the deputy chief prosecutor.

443
00:32:52,387 --> 00:32:53,972
Your daughter is studying in the US.

444
00:32:54,472 --> 00:32:56,349
You and your wife live in Seorae Village.

445
00:32:56,849 --> 00:32:58,476
Your dog's name is Tori, I believe.

446
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:00,186
What are you getting at?

447
00:33:00,269 --> 00:33:01,896
You knew I did drugs.

448
00:33:04,524 --> 00:33:05,942
You did them with me, remember?

449
00:33:06,442 --> 00:33:08,361
Have you lost your mind?

450
00:33:08,444 --> 00:33:09,529
What?

451
00:33:09,612 --> 00:33:11,072
You and I did drugs together?

452
00:33:20,915 --> 00:33:24,419
A prosecutor should know
how to control his temper.

453
00:33:30,883 --> 00:33:33,511
A dying detective
wrote this as his last will.

454
00:33:34,095 --> 00:33:35,972
You shouldn't throw it
with such disregard.

455
00:33:36,556 --> 00:33:39,142
I'll kill you if you pull something.

456
00:33:39,851 --> 00:33:43,271
Getting rid of scum like you--

457
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:52,447
Prosecutor Moon,

458
00:33:53,614 --> 00:33:56,284
I helped as much as I could
to make it easier for you

459
00:33:56,367 --> 00:33:57,827
to fund your daughter's education.

460
00:33:57,910 --> 00:33:59,203
Was it not enough?

461
00:33:59,287 --> 00:34:00,538
You're out of your mind.

462
00:34:00,621 --> 00:34:02,832
If I'm a drug dealer,
that makes you a druggie.

463
00:34:03,458 --> 00:34:04,709
The drug I sell

464
00:34:04,792 --> 00:34:06,878
can't be detected in one's system.

465
00:34:06,961 --> 00:34:07,879
So think about it.

466
00:34:09,505 --> 00:34:11,758
How many times have we met at Heritage?

467
00:34:14,677 --> 00:34:17,638
The testimony of the living
outweighs that of the dead.

468
00:34:19,515 --> 00:34:20,767
And I can testify

469
00:34:22,143 --> 00:34:23,269
that you…

470
00:34:27,106 --> 00:34:28,149
got high.

471
00:34:29,275 --> 00:34:30,568
I never did any drugs.

472
00:34:30,651 --> 00:34:32,361
You moron.

473
00:34:33,154 --> 00:34:35,990
Who'd believe you
when I'll say that you did?

474
00:34:36,866 --> 00:34:37,700
Mr. Ryu…

475
00:34:39,619 --> 00:34:41,537
That's right. I'm a mobster.

476
00:34:41,621 --> 00:34:43,539
Your daughter in the US, your wife,

477
00:34:43,623 --> 00:34:45,041
as well as your mistress.

478
00:34:46,834 --> 00:34:48,711
Maybe I should cut them all into pieces.

479
00:34:51,005 --> 00:34:53,216
I won't hurt your dog
who had kneecap surgery.

480
00:34:54,759 --> 00:34:56,177
We don't kill animals.

481
00:34:57,887 --> 00:34:58,721
Do you know why?

482
00:35:00,473 --> 00:35:03,059
Because dogs don't talk. They only bark.

483
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:06,604
So do the same and just bark.

484
00:35:08,356 --> 00:35:09,732
That's how you'll survive.

485
00:35:20,076 --> 00:35:23,788
"A friend that has nothing to offer
is like a dull blade."

486
00:35:25,289 --> 00:35:26,791
It's a Russian saying.

487
00:35:29,085 --> 00:35:32,547
Be a sharp knife I can wield.

488
00:35:34,465 --> 00:35:35,675
Know your place.

489
00:35:38,219 --> 00:35:39,512
Fruit of the poisonous tree.

490
00:35:40,847 --> 00:35:43,307
They'll soon submit
a puffer jacket as evidence.

491
00:35:43,808 --> 00:35:47,270
However,
that evidence was obtained illegally,

492
00:35:47,353 --> 00:35:48,855
therefore making it inadmissible.

493
00:35:49,730 --> 00:35:51,440
In other words, they have nothing.

494
00:35:53,276 --> 00:35:54,735
Even their witnesses are dead.

495
00:36:00,241 --> 00:36:03,744
You didn't even offer
a cup of coffee to your guest.

496
00:36:06,664 --> 00:36:08,499
I'll be off to get some for myself.

497
00:36:14,589 --> 00:36:16,340
Your shoelaces are undone.

498
00:36:16,424 --> 00:36:18,551
I see this a lot among druggies.

499
00:36:18,634 --> 00:36:20,261
Undone shoelaces, zippers,

500
00:36:20,344 --> 00:36:21,554
and buttons on suits.

501
00:36:26,017 --> 00:36:27,310
You'd better take care, buddy.

502
00:36:27,810 --> 00:36:29,270
You don't want to give
the wrong impression.

503
00:36:35,151 --> 00:36:36,068
Then…

504
00:36:36,861 --> 00:36:38,112
please excuse me,

505
00:36:39,238 --> 00:36:40,198
Prosecutor Moon.

506
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:56,589
Kyle.

507
00:36:57,381 --> 00:37:00,092
What's your favorite Korean dish?

508
00:37:00,885 --> 00:37:01,886
Bulgogi.

509
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:06,349
All right, let's have bulgogi today.

510
00:37:10,228 --> 00:37:11,938
Pavel is the world's only mafia group

511
00:37:12,021 --> 00:37:14,315
that educates their members thoroughly.

512
00:37:14,398 --> 00:37:17,568
They receive systematic education
in law, politics, and finance.

513
00:37:18,444 --> 00:37:22,073
Pavel's business methods and objectives
are unlike those of any other mafia group.

514
00:37:23,074 --> 00:37:26,077
They probably have their eyes on you.

515
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:28,037
If they want to play,

516
00:37:28,871 --> 00:37:30,498
let them.

517
00:37:33,084 --> 00:37:34,126
Gentleman.

518
00:37:38,798 --> 00:37:41,008
What did you do before all this?

519
00:37:44,303 --> 00:37:45,304
Well…

520
00:37:46,722 --> 00:37:47,890
You'll find out

521
00:37:48,975 --> 00:37:50,226
in due time.

522
00:38:09,912 --> 00:38:10,788
All right.

523
00:38:10,871 --> 00:38:13,291
Tell Madam Kim you made money
selling the antidote

524
00:38:13,916 --> 00:38:15,501
and that was why you tried to run.

525
00:38:15,584 --> 00:38:18,629
Say you won't do that ever again
and give her all the money.

526
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:21,924
Then I'm sure she'll believe you.

527
00:38:23,551 --> 00:38:26,804
They're probably all worked up right now,
like an angry hornet's nest.

528
00:38:27,555 --> 00:38:30,808
They won't have the mental capacity
to suspect you.

529
00:38:30,891 --> 00:38:31,851
What…

530
00:38:33,019 --> 00:38:34,312
do you need me to do?

531
00:38:34,395 --> 00:38:36,939
Your client list won't cut it.

532
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:41,944
Bring me the names
of all the distributors in the country.

533
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:46,407
That is the condition of your release.

534
00:38:53,873 --> 00:38:55,124
Over there.

535
00:38:55,207 --> 00:38:56,042
Got it.

536
00:39:09,305 --> 00:39:10,556
I found one.

537
00:39:12,016 --> 00:39:13,559
Damn it!

538
00:39:14,185 --> 00:39:15,269
Don't just stand there.

539
00:39:15,353 --> 00:39:16,645
Keep looking for more!

540
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,321
What are you doing?

541
00:39:25,404 --> 00:39:26,739
Keep looking!

542
00:39:27,656 --> 00:39:28,491
I found one!

543
00:39:36,707 --> 00:39:37,750
You know what?

544
00:39:37,833 --> 00:39:39,126
Search again.

545
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:41,712
The restrooms, the artwork,
the plants, everything!

546
00:39:49,261 --> 00:39:50,471
Hello?

547
00:39:52,181 --> 00:39:53,265
Is that you, Tae-ri?

548
00:39:53,766 --> 00:39:55,142
Where were you?

549
00:39:56,143 --> 00:39:58,521
This kimchi stew
only takes seven minutes to make.

550
00:39:58,604 --> 00:39:59,855
Here we go.

551
00:39:59,939 --> 00:40:03,526
First, start by chopping up the kimchi

552
00:40:03,609 --> 00:40:05,403
to make it easier to eat with rice.

553
00:40:21,502 --> 00:40:23,087
That hits the spot!

554
00:40:29,635 --> 00:40:30,719
Where are you?

555
00:40:31,262 --> 00:40:33,389
Hey, Si-o. I'll be right there.

556
00:40:57,246 --> 00:40:59,498
I figured it'd be better for me
to come to you

557
00:40:59,582 --> 00:41:01,417
than to have you come to me.

558
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:05,212
After all, the Commissioner General
has his eye on you and not me.

559
00:41:06,172 --> 00:41:08,340
A new commissioner general
will be appointed next week.

560
00:41:08,924 --> 00:41:11,260
I'm sure you're aware that would mean me.

561
00:41:13,637 --> 00:41:14,722
So hang in there for a week.

562
00:41:17,224 --> 00:41:19,643
Will the warrant request be denied?

563
00:41:19,727 --> 00:41:21,312
Probably.
They'll cite insufficient evidence.

564
00:41:22,146 --> 00:41:23,063
Commissioner General An,

565
00:41:23,147 --> 00:41:25,483
the deputy chief prosecutor,
and the presiding judge

566
00:41:25,566 --> 00:41:27,026
are all affiliated with Ryu Si-o.

567
00:41:28,486 --> 00:41:29,904
We need something more.

568
00:41:29,987 --> 00:41:31,363
We have physical evidence.

569
00:41:31,447 --> 00:41:32,865
One that contains the drug.

570
00:41:32,948 --> 00:41:36,118
If we can't prove that it came from Doogo,

571
00:41:36,202 --> 00:41:37,703
they'll just cook up a story.

572
00:41:38,537 --> 00:41:39,747
Hold out for a week.

573
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:42,416
I'll have your backs.

574
00:41:46,921 --> 00:41:49,340
GANGHAN POLICE PRECINCT

575
00:41:58,891 --> 00:41:59,808
You poor thing.

576
00:42:00,351 --> 00:42:01,435
Hey, Hee-sik.

577
00:42:01,977 --> 00:42:04,188
Go home and get some rest.

578
00:42:04,271 --> 00:42:06,357
You stayed up all night interrogating.

579
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:07,733
He's right. Go home.

580
00:42:07,816 --> 00:42:08,817
We'll handle the rest.

581
00:42:09,401 --> 00:42:10,486
Head home.

582
00:42:17,076 --> 00:42:19,203
Gan I-sik, I'm off to work.

583
00:42:19,286 --> 00:42:22,122
I waited for you to come home,
but you didn't.

584
00:42:22,206 --> 00:42:25,000
So I fixed you a delicious meal
with what you had at home.

585
00:42:25,084 --> 00:42:26,210
I did a good job, right?

586
00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:30,047
Why does this worry me?

587
00:42:30,130 --> 00:42:31,257
Why? What is it?

588
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:32,216
Why are you worried?

589
00:42:32,299 --> 00:42:34,009
Nam-soon made me a meal.

590
00:42:34,093 --> 00:42:36,345
-What?
-She's staying at my place.

591
00:42:37,012 --> 00:42:38,847
Wait. What was that?

592
00:42:38,931 --> 00:42:40,307
Do you two live together?

593
00:42:40,391 --> 00:42:41,433
I knew it. You didn't know, right?

594
00:42:41,517 --> 00:42:43,602
The two of them…

595
00:42:43,686 --> 00:42:45,479
Sparks have been flying.

596
00:42:45,563 --> 00:42:48,232
-You naughty boy.
-It's not like that.

597
00:42:48,315 --> 00:42:49,858
Kids these days aren't like us.

598
00:42:49,942 --> 00:42:51,860
They live together before getting married.

599
00:42:51,944 --> 00:42:52,945
-Exactly.
-Bravo.

600
00:42:53,028 --> 00:42:54,905
She overpowered you in the end.

601
00:42:54,989 --> 00:42:57,366
-It's not like that.
-Personally,

602
00:42:57,449 --> 00:42:59,034
I'm quite fond of Agent Gang.

603
00:42:59,118 --> 00:43:00,411
I approve of this match.

604
00:43:00,494 --> 00:43:01,537
I second that.

605
00:43:01,620 --> 00:43:03,539
She's even the daughter of a rich family.

606
00:43:03,622 --> 00:43:05,291
I'll serve her as my sister-in-law.

607
00:43:05,833 --> 00:43:06,834
By the way,

608
00:43:07,459 --> 00:43:09,461
does she have any siblings?

609
00:43:09,545 --> 00:43:10,379
She does.

610
00:43:11,922 --> 00:43:12,840
A brother.

611
00:43:14,008 --> 00:43:15,050
Well,

612
00:43:15,134 --> 00:43:17,636
that's not a total deal-breaker for me.

613
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:19,013
-You punk.
-What?

614
00:43:19,096 --> 00:43:20,431
-Can you be more desperate?
-Why?

615
00:43:20,514 --> 00:43:22,057
Are you struggling to pay your loans?

616
00:43:22,558 --> 00:43:23,767
I'm not struggling.

617
00:43:23,851 --> 00:43:26,228
Let's go over to the newlyweds'
for a meal.

618
00:43:26,312 --> 00:43:27,438
-Up you go.
-Come on.

619
00:43:27,521 --> 00:43:29,106
Let's go eat some food.

620
00:43:29,189 --> 00:43:30,441
Let's go and eat breakfast.

621
00:43:30,524 --> 00:43:31,942
-We'll eat together.
-What's with you?

622
00:43:32,026 --> 00:43:34,320
Let's eat what your bride made for you.

623
00:43:34,903 --> 00:43:36,780
Why is everything in big chunks?

624
00:43:36,864 --> 00:43:39,158
-Let's enjoy.
-This is interesting.

625
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:40,868
This kimchi stew is…

626
00:43:53,589 --> 00:43:55,549
What the heck did I just eat?

627
00:43:56,383 --> 00:43:58,010
Did she season it with ketchup?

628
00:43:58,093 --> 00:43:59,887
Probably. The bottle was empty.

629
00:44:01,138 --> 00:44:04,141
I swear this is the worst dish
I've ever had in my life.

630
00:44:04,224 --> 00:44:07,728
Water and kimchi would've been enough.
There was no need to get creative.

631
00:44:07,811 --> 00:44:09,021
It's also salty.

632
00:44:09,104 --> 00:44:09,938
It's not too bad.

633
00:44:10,022 --> 00:44:11,273
It reminds me of tom yum soup.

634
00:44:11,357 --> 00:44:12,608
Tom yum soup?

635
00:44:12,691 --> 00:44:15,778
Dude, the Thai Embassy
will sue you for that statement.

636
00:44:15,861 --> 00:44:18,572
He must truly love Agent Gang.

637
00:44:18,656 --> 00:44:19,907
But it is good.

638
00:44:23,202 --> 00:44:24,328
Si-o…

639
00:44:35,756 --> 00:44:37,341
2023 DOOGO RESEARCH LAB
Q3 DATA

640
00:44:44,014 --> 00:44:45,349
He should keep his desk tidy.

641
00:44:49,353 --> 00:44:50,396
Si-o!

642
00:44:54,650 --> 00:44:55,734
Have you had lunch?

643
00:44:55,818 --> 00:44:57,820
Yeah, I have. What about you?

644
00:44:57,903 --> 00:44:58,987
Likewise.

645
00:45:00,447 --> 00:45:01,448
Tsetseg,

646
00:45:03,992 --> 00:45:06,745
your current roommate isn't a guy, right?

647
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:09,832
Of course, my roommate's a girl.

648
00:45:10,416 --> 00:45:12,292
A sweet and pretty girl.

649
00:45:14,795 --> 00:45:16,380
Let me help you gain citizenship.

650
00:45:17,339 --> 00:45:19,091
No, that's all right.

651
00:45:19,174 --> 00:45:20,008
I'll handle it myself.

652
00:45:20,884 --> 00:45:22,636
It's just that I want to help you.

653
00:45:23,429 --> 00:45:24,847
I want you to be happier.

654
00:45:24,930 --> 00:45:25,889
It's all right.

655
00:45:26,432 --> 00:45:28,308
You see,

656
00:45:28,392 --> 00:45:29,977
I need to do things by myself.

657
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:31,895
That's how my Mongolian parents raised me.

658
00:45:33,147 --> 00:45:34,690
Then at least let me help you

659
00:45:35,482 --> 00:45:36,442
find a place to live.

660
00:45:37,276 --> 00:45:38,193
It's okay.

661
00:45:38,277 --> 00:45:39,570
I'm comfortable where I am.

662
00:45:42,865 --> 00:45:44,199
How much closer must we be

663
00:45:45,117 --> 00:45:47,411
for you to accept something from me?

664
00:45:50,873 --> 00:45:51,915
Show me

665
00:45:53,041 --> 00:45:54,751
everything.

666
00:45:56,253 --> 00:45:57,546
And tell me everything.

667
00:45:59,214 --> 00:46:00,257
I'm already doing that.

668
00:46:02,092 --> 00:46:05,554
I've never opened up this much
to anyone before.

669
00:46:07,347 --> 00:46:08,265
Really?

670
00:46:09,183 --> 00:46:12,936
Then why do I still feel like
I barely know you?

671
00:46:15,814 --> 00:46:16,773
All right.

672
00:46:19,359 --> 00:46:20,736
Ask what's on your mind.

673
00:46:21,528 --> 00:46:22,821
I'll tell you everything.

674
00:46:23,322 --> 00:46:24,239
The lab.

675
00:46:25,782 --> 00:46:27,576
Doogo's a logistics company,

676
00:46:27,659 --> 00:46:29,161
so why does it have a lab?

677
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:32,206
What happens there?

678
00:46:35,292 --> 00:46:36,710
Why does it interest you?

679
00:46:42,049 --> 00:46:44,593
I want to do my job well.

680
00:46:45,844 --> 00:46:47,930
Medicine isn't something
Doogo distributes.

681
00:46:51,642 --> 00:46:52,684
All right.

682
00:46:54,353 --> 00:46:55,354
I'll take you there.

683
00:47:04,404 --> 00:47:06,573

685
00:48:09,469 --> 00:48:10,512
Where…

686
00:48:12,389 --> 00:48:14,224
But this is where she went.

687
00:48:19,521 --> 00:48:20,564
What on earth?

688
00:48:20,647 --> 00:48:22,816
Why are you here, of all places?

689
00:48:25,027 --> 00:48:26,236
Explain yourself.

690
00:48:31,199 --> 00:48:32,826
I'm so congested.

691
00:48:42,628 --> 00:48:44,755
Yes, hello?

692
00:48:44,838 --> 00:48:46,923
Boss, I got caught.

693
00:48:48,258 --> 00:48:49,217
Look here, Mr. Bread.

694
00:48:50,093 --> 00:48:52,763
Meet me at Gold Blue this instant.

695
00:48:52,846 --> 00:48:53,889
Sure thing.

696
00:48:59,478 --> 00:49:01,772
Jeez, that idiot.

697
00:49:05,692 --> 00:49:06,985
Get in here, Nam-gil.

698
00:49:09,863 --> 00:49:10,822
Did you ask for me?

699
00:49:10,906 --> 00:49:11,865
Nam-gil,

700
00:49:12,824 --> 00:49:14,159
deal with him.

701
00:49:22,959 --> 00:49:24,252
Does it hurt?

702
00:49:26,129 --> 00:49:27,673
My throat.

703
00:49:43,230 --> 00:49:45,774
Do, re, mi, fa, sol, la, ti, do

704
00:49:45,857 --> 00:49:46,692
Try that.

705
00:49:46,775 --> 00:49:48,735
Do, re, mi

706
00:49:48,819 --> 00:49:50,153
Fa, sol

707
00:49:50,237 --> 00:49:52,948
La, ti, do

708
00:49:53,031 --> 00:49:54,574
-Do
-Do

709
00:49:54,658 --> 00:49:56,118
-Do
-Do

710
00:49:56,618 --> 00:49:57,577
Quiet!

711
00:49:59,121 --> 00:50:00,497
Take it outside where I can't hear you!

712
00:50:02,791 --> 00:50:03,875
Let's take it outside.

713
00:50:04,376 --> 00:50:05,585
I think you hurt your Adam's apple.

714
00:50:14,970 --> 00:50:16,346
I sound like a chicken.

715
00:50:20,475 --> 00:50:22,269
You're being ridiculous!

716
00:50:27,232 --> 00:50:28,191
Goodness.

717
00:50:29,067 --> 00:50:30,277
There you go.

718
00:50:33,113 --> 00:50:34,448
Should I get you a raw egg?

719
00:50:35,323 --> 00:50:37,325
You really are too kind.

720
00:50:44,124 --> 00:50:45,751
Mr. Song, you're here.

721
00:50:46,376 --> 00:50:47,377
You…

722
00:50:47,461 --> 00:50:48,837
What happened to your voice?

723
00:50:49,713 --> 00:50:50,922
Did you inhale helium?

724
00:50:51,006 --> 00:50:52,340
No, it's not like that.

725
00:50:52,841 --> 00:50:54,468
Ms. Hwang…

726
00:50:55,051 --> 00:50:56,678
attacked me.

727
00:50:57,471 --> 00:50:58,513
You were hit by a woman?

728
00:50:59,181 --> 00:51:01,892
You've got to be kidding me.

729
00:51:07,272 --> 00:51:08,732
Where's Ms. Hwang?

730
00:51:09,399 --> 00:51:10,817
-Lead the way.
-In there.

731
00:51:15,238 --> 00:51:18,074
I just don't get her.

732
00:51:23,163 --> 00:51:24,956
Why were you having me tailed?

733
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:28,335
First, tell me why you pretended
to be in the hospital.

734
00:51:29,586 --> 00:51:32,339
What's your relationship with Ryu Si-o?

735
00:51:32,923 --> 00:51:35,133
-Ms. Hwang--
-You told him that it wasn't me

736
00:51:35,217 --> 00:51:37,010
lying in that hospital bed, didn't you?

737
00:51:37,093 --> 00:51:38,136
That's why

738
00:51:38,845 --> 00:51:40,096
Madam Kim came for me.

739
00:51:40,180 --> 00:51:41,348
Madam Kim?

740
00:51:41,431 --> 00:51:43,433
From which hostess bar?

741
00:51:46,228 --> 00:51:47,145
Are you kidding me?

742
00:51:49,731 --> 00:51:50,899
Ms. Hwang,

743
00:51:50,982 --> 00:51:52,025
let's stop…

744
00:51:53,401 --> 00:51:54,861
wasting our time.

745
00:51:54,945 --> 00:51:55,779
All right.

746
00:51:56,863 --> 00:51:58,198
That's exactly what I wanted.

747
00:52:00,158 --> 00:52:01,159
When did it start?

748
00:52:01,243 --> 00:52:02,077
What do you mean?

749
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:03,745
Stop playing dumb.

750
00:52:06,373 --> 00:52:07,249
Ms. Hwang.

751
00:52:09,584 --> 00:52:10,418
You should…

752
00:52:12,254 --> 00:52:13,255
go out with me.

753
00:52:14,548 --> 00:52:15,382
What?

754
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:22,889
You had a stand-in patient take your place

755
00:52:23,765 --> 00:52:25,851
just to win my attention.

756
00:52:26,726 --> 00:52:30,230
How long have you been
running background checks on me?

757
00:52:30,313 --> 00:52:34,234
You even found an old photo of me
that no one knows about.

758
00:52:34,317 --> 00:52:35,235
What…

759
00:52:36,278 --> 00:52:37,320
You're adorable.

760
00:52:39,739 --> 00:52:41,241
So let's date.

761
00:52:41,324 --> 00:52:43,243
Even though you're not really my type.

762
00:52:43,326 --> 00:52:45,537
I happen to prefer puppy-like faces.

763
00:52:46,079 --> 00:52:49,457
Still, I'll try to find something else
that does it for me.

764
00:52:49,958 --> 00:52:52,168
You little cream bun.

765
00:52:54,296 --> 00:52:55,338
Look here, Mr. Bread.

766
00:52:56,840 --> 00:53:00,302
What on earth are you?

767
00:53:00,802 --> 00:53:02,387
Why are you doing this to me?

768
00:53:04,389 --> 00:53:05,682
Isn't this what you wanted?

769
00:53:06,975 --> 00:53:10,854
The photo of you and Ryu Si-o in Russia.

770
00:53:12,022 --> 00:53:13,648
Explain that to me.

771
00:53:14,524 --> 00:53:17,569
You keep mentioning this Ryu Si-o guy.
Who the hell is that?

772
00:53:17,652 --> 00:53:19,237
You're only making me jealous.

773
00:53:19,321 --> 00:53:20,655
What's with that photo?

774
00:53:22,282 --> 00:53:23,783
Explain it to me.

775
00:53:24,492 --> 00:53:25,410
I'll…

776
00:53:27,245 --> 00:53:28,246
tell you

777
00:53:28,830 --> 00:53:30,457
if you date me.

778
00:53:34,377 --> 00:53:35,754
You've lost it, haven't you?

779
00:53:42,844 --> 00:53:43,762
Let's go to the press.

780
00:53:43,845 --> 00:53:45,263
Kick them in the side.

781
00:53:45,347 --> 00:53:48,516
We'll say Doogo is exporting narcotics
in puffer jackets. How's that?

782
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:51,728
Director Jung Dae-cheol
is a member of Heritage Club.

783
00:53:52,312 --> 00:53:54,397
Ryu Si-o even has the media covered.

784
00:53:56,733 --> 00:53:58,526
An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.

785
00:53:59,069 --> 00:53:59,903
Okay.

786
00:54:01,154 --> 00:54:02,447
I'm heading out for a bit.

787
00:54:02,530 --> 00:54:04,491
Let's give it a try and see who wins.

788
00:54:06,242 --> 00:54:08,411
That puffer jacket's huge.

789
00:54:08,495 --> 00:54:10,288
Is it because it was made for Russians?

790
00:54:10,372 --> 00:54:12,707
It's because this wasn't made
for someone to wear.

791
00:54:12,791 --> 00:54:14,459
It was made big to carry more drugs.

792
00:54:14,542 --> 00:54:16,127
-I see.
-You're a genius.

793
00:54:17,253 --> 00:54:18,296
You little punk.

794
00:54:20,382 --> 00:54:21,675
-Where are you going?
-Not again.

795
00:54:21,758 --> 00:54:23,134
He's going by himself again.

796
00:54:23,218 --> 00:54:24,260
Leave him be.

797
00:54:48,034 --> 00:54:48,868
What the…

798
00:54:50,286 --> 00:54:51,371
What the hell?

799
00:55:02,590 --> 00:55:05,176
I called Reporter Kim,
so head to the studio.

800
00:55:05,885 --> 00:55:08,304
Tell the staff we'll be going live.

801
00:55:08,388 --> 00:55:09,681
Yes, ma'am.

802
00:55:22,610 --> 00:55:23,862
Where to, ma'am?

803
00:55:25,405 --> 00:55:27,574
Number 8, Dosin-daero 34-gil, please.

804
00:55:27,657 --> 00:55:29,325
All right.

805
00:55:36,708 --> 00:55:37,792
Yes, Ms. Hwang.

806
00:55:37,876 --> 00:55:39,711
Na-young, I sent you a car.

807
00:55:39,794 --> 00:55:41,296
But I already got in a taxi.

808
00:55:41,379 --> 00:55:42,630
Why would you take a taxi?

809
00:55:43,381 --> 00:55:44,758
It's all right, ma'am.

810
00:55:45,258 --> 00:55:46,217
I'll be there soon.

811
00:55:46,718 --> 00:55:47,969
Don't worry.

812
00:55:49,012 --> 00:55:49,846
Yes.

813
00:56:06,488 --> 00:56:07,572
SECRETARY YOON

814
00:56:07,655 --> 00:56:08,782
It's done.

815
00:56:13,244 --> 00:56:15,371
Are we done hanging out for today?

816
00:56:15,455 --> 00:56:16,915
I'm afraid that's the case.

817
00:56:18,333 --> 00:56:19,459
We'll hang out more tomorrow.

818
00:56:20,502 --> 00:56:21,336
Okay.

819
00:56:42,315 --> 00:56:43,191
Good night.

820
00:56:43,817 --> 00:56:44,818
Okay.

821
00:56:45,860 --> 00:56:46,861
See you.

822
00:57:05,588 --> 00:57:06,506
Tsetseg,

823
00:57:07,382 --> 00:57:08,758
you're all I need.

824
00:57:10,176 --> 00:57:12,887
Now, I can even take on Pavel.

825
00:57:21,813 --> 00:57:23,773
GEUMJU TV NEWS

826
00:57:39,581 --> 00:57:41,666
The phone has been turned off.

827
00:57:41,749 --> 00:57:43,835
You will be redirected to voicemail.

828
00:57:43,918 --> 00:57:46,087
After the tone, you will be charged…

829
00:59:08,002 --> 00:59:08,920
Don't go.

830
00:59:12,465 --> 00:59:13,550
Starting now,

831
00:59:17,262 --> 00:59:18,513
just relax.

832
01:00:32,462 --> 01:00:35,214
STRONG GIRL NAM-SOON

833

Hwang Geum-ju has a daughter.

834
01:00:37,508 --> 01:00:38,718
Find Gang Nam-soon.

835
01:00:38,801 --> 01:00:40,720
Gan I-sik, I'm sending you a package.

836
01:00:40,803 --> 01:00:42,555
I'll send it your way,
so have it analyzed.

837
01:00:42,639 --> 01:00:45,808
There's something important
I must do today.

838
01:00:45,892 --> 01:00:47,935
Gil Joong-gan is my lady.

839
01:00:48,019 --> 01:00:49,145
You damn sleazebag!

840
01:00:49,228 --> 01:00:51,064
Do I have to choose one?

841
01:00:51,147 --> 01:00:52,273
One at a time.

842
01:00:52,357 --> 01:00:53,900
Start with the easiest one.

843
01:00:53,983 --> 01:00:55,526
Who sent you boys?

844
01:00:55,610 --> 01:00:57,362
Go ahead and take
disciplinary action against me.

845
01:00:57,445 --> 01:00:59,030
I'm quitting.

846
01:00:59,113 --> 01:01:00,907
I'm going to put all my trust in you.

847
01:01:00,990 --> 01:01:02,367
You were curious about the lab, right?

848
01:01:02,450 --> 01:01:04,410
Who is she to you
that you brought her here?

849
01:01:04,494 --> 01:01:05,328
She's one of my people.

850
01:01:06,579 --> 01:01:11,584
