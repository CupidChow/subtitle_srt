1
00:00:42,667 --> 00:00:45,962
STRONG GIRL NAM-SOON

2
00:01:16,618 --> 00:01:17,577
Yes?

3
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:19,120
Which hospital was she taken to?

4
00:01:31,341 --> 00:01:32,383
Geumju Hospital, sir.

5
00:01:33,426 --> 00:01:35,220
Right, she owns a hospital too.

6
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:36,638
Yes.

7
00:01:36,721 --> 00:01:38,389
Check if she's truly dead.

8
00:01:40,391 --> 00:01:41,476
Yes, sir.

9
00:02:17,011 --> 00:02:18,346
I'm afraid no visitors are allowed.

10
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:22,183
Help, I'm dying!

11
00:02:22,267 --> 00:02:24,144
-I'm dying over here.
-Hey.

12
00:02:24,727 --> 00:02:27,355
Quit whining and zip it.

13
00:02:27,438 --> 00:02:29,274
Don't make me shut you up.

14
00:02:41,786 --> 00:02:43,955
Just because you want to kill someone

15
00:02:44,038 --> 00:02:46,166
doesn't mean you should.

16
00:02:51,462 --> 00:02:53,298
And here I thought you were on my side.

17
00:02:54,757 --> 00:02:55,592
Was I wrong?

18
00:03:08,313 --> 00:03:09,814
Of course I'm on your side.

19
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:11,566
So?

20
00:03:11,649 --> 00:03:13,026
Is she dead?

21
00:03:15,111 --> 00:03:16,362
I'll tell you once it's confirmed.

22
00:03:17,655 --> 00:03:19,949
If she isn't, she'll die some other day.

23
00:03:20,575 --> 00:03:21,618
That woman…

24
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:25,371
gets on my nerves.

25
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:31,544
Those I want dead end up that way.

26
00:03:32,128 --> 00:03:34,047
Is that why you gave me this job?

27
00:03:35,632 --> 00:03:37,884
Do I have to kill people for you as well?

28
00:03:40,136 --> 00:03:40,970
What's wrong?

29
00:03:43,806 --> 00:03:44,974
You can't do it?

30
00:03:47,852 --> 00:03:48,978
Of course I can.

31
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:51,773
If that's what you want, I'll do it.

32
00:04:03,534 --> 00:04:05,453
Why isn't she picking up?

33
00:04:06,037 --> 00:04:07,121
The person you called…

34
00:04:08,456 --> 00:04:09,457
Hey, Geum-ju.

35
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:12,710
I'm in the VIP ward at your hospital.

36
00:04:12,794 --> 00:04:16,130
I was so happy to see your father
for the first time in ten years

37
00:04:16,214 --> 00:04:19,092
that I could barely
put the excitement into words.

38
00:04:19,175 --> 00:04:20,260
So I hit him once.

39
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:22,387
Just a slight push
that won't leave a mark.

40
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:25,765
HWANG ***-JONG (M)

41
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,144
Gosh, this is killing me.

42
00:04:32,188 --> 00:04:33,648
It hurts.

43
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:38,069
I returned to my home country
after ten years

44
00:04:38,152 --> 00:04:39,862
just to meet my maker.

45
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:42,031
I'm afraid it's an L1 fracture.

46
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:43,866
He'll need emergency surgery.

47
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:45,159
Take a look.

48
00:04:45,868 --> 00:04:47,829
This is the L1 vertebra.

49
00:04:47,912 --> 00:04:51,582
As the tailbone fractured,
it applied pressure on the L1.

50
00:04:52,834 --> 00:04:54,544
Physical therapy won't help.

51
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:56,129
He'll need screws inserted.

52
00:04:56,212 --> 00:04:57,422
Forget screws.

53
00:04:57,505 --> 00:04:59,465
Just stick nails into him instead.

54
00:05:00,174 --> 00:05:02,719
If he's having surgery,
it should be done properly.

55
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:04,387
Yes, of course.

56
00:05:05,346 --> 00:05:09,058
By the way, I heard Ms. Hwang
is currently hospitalized.

57
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:11,019
-Hospitalized?
-Yes.

58
00:05:11,102 --> 00:05:12,228
You mean Geum-ju?

59
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:19,527
-No visitors are allowed.
-Seriously?

60
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:20,862
That's my daughter.

61
00:05:20,945 --> 00:05:22,947
Absolutely no visitors are allowed.

62
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:23,990
Why you…

63
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:26,242
I said she's my daughter!

64
00:05:44,635 --> 00:05:45,636
Geum-ju.

65
00:05:50,266 --> 00:05:51,100
Geum-ju!

66
00:05:51,684 --> 00:05:53,644
Goodness, Geum-ju…

67
00:05:55,229 --> 00:05:58,357
What on earth happened to you?

68
00:06:00,777 --> 00:06:02,320
Who did this to you?

69
00:06:02,904 --> 00:06:06,032
You need to get back on your feet.

70
00:06:06,991 --> 00:06:10,787
What am I going to do?

71
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,413
I don't know what to do.

72
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:17,043
I'll…

73
00:06:18,294 --> 00:06:20,254
I'll do everything in my power

74
00:06:21,005 --> 00:06:23,841
to get you back on your feet.

75
00:06:26,511 --> 00:06:28,971
Who the hell did this to you?

76
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:30,723
I'll rip them to pieces

77
00:06:31,766 --> 00:06:34,852
and crush their skulls!

78
00:06:36,813 --> 00:06:39,398
Tell me which bastard did this!

79
00:06:42,527 --> 00:06:45,279
Who the hell is calling me right now?

80
00:06:49,784 --> 00:06:51,160
Oh no.

81
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:56,082
"Bratty daughter"?

82
00:06:57,458 --> 00:06:58,668
BRATTY DAUGHTER

83
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:01,921
Hello?

84
00:07:02,755 --> 00:07:03,589
Mom.

85
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:08,177
What are you doing in there?

86
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:10,179
You should worry about Dad.

87
00:07:10,763 --> 00:07:12,473
How could you beat up innocent citizens

88
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:15,184
after receiving the Brave Citizen Award?

89
00:07:20,314 --> 00:07:22,483
-Who on earth are you?
-Who else?

90
00:07:22,567 --> 00:07:23,985
She's my stand-in.

91
00:07:24,068 --> 00:07:29,031
EPISODE 10
THE STAND-INS

92
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:37,707
What if something happens to you

93
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:40,084
because you provoked Ryu Si-o?

94
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:41,878
He's capable of practically anything.

95
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:46,924
Nam-soon, I may be reckless by default,

96
00:07:47,008 --> 00:07:48,676
but I know how scary people can be.

97
00:07:49,385 --> 00:07:51,512
While doing vigilante work in Gangnam,

98
00:07:52,013 --> 00:07:55,057
I've met all kinds of cruel people
the world has to offer.

99
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:58,436
So I am ready and determined

100
00:07:58,519 --> 00:08:00,271
in a way that'll knock your socks off.

101
00:08:00,354 --> 00:08:01,272
Don't worry.

102
00:08:01,355 --> 00:08:03,191
You'll knock my socks off?

103
00:08:03,274 --> 00:08:06,110
My goal was to provoke Ryu Si-o.

104
00:08:06,194 --> 00:08:08,196
People end up making mistakes

105
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:10,156
when they run on impulse and emotions.

106
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:12,992
We need Ryu Si-o to make a mistake.

107
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:17,038
A cheese sitting in a trap

108
00:08:17,121 --> 00:08:19,540
will never bait a clever rat.

109
00:08:19,624 --> 00:08:20,833
In that case,

110
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:23,669
the rat must be provoked in another way.

111
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:25,880
Either way,

112
00:08:27,381 --> 00:08:28,633
just trust me on this.

113
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:33,846
It was just as I expected, Nam-soon.

114
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:35,973
The rat has been provoked.

115
00:08:36,057 --> 00:08:37,558
I'm fine.

116
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:41,812
That's my mom.

117
00:08:43,481 --> 00:08:44,524
Ryu Si-o.

118
00:08:44,607 --> 00:08:47,610
You'll pay for this down the road.

119
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:50,863
How dare you go after my mom?

120
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:57,537
I will thoroughly crush you to bits.

121
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:00,873
From the hair on your head
down to your toenails.

122
00:09:08,256 --> 00:09:09,340
Hi, Ms. Baby Face.

123
00:09:09,423 --> 00:09:11,133
Hey, Hillary.

124
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:19,141
What is this?

125
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:22,144
My gosh.

126
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:24,564
I can't believe what just happened to you!

127
00:09:26,023 --> 00:09:27,149
What on earth?

128
00:09:28,442 --> 00:09:29,443
My makeup.

129
00:09:29,527 --> 00:09:31,946
I need to fix my makeup.

130
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:39,829
Ms. Baek,
who looks great even without makeup,

131
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:44,625
do you know where CTA4885 is?

132
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:47,878
Where else would it be
but the Doogo warehouse?

133
00:09:47,962 --> 00:09:49,630
Where in the warehouse?

134
00:09:50,673 --> 00:09:52,341
There are multiple sections.

135
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:56,804
Could it be somewhere
that only Mr. Ryu knows?

136
00:09:56,887 --> 00:09:58,389
How should I know?

137
00:09:58,889 --> 00:10:00,641
Only Manager Heo from logistics would.

138
00:10:02,143 --> 00:10:03,269
Mr. Heo knows that?

139
00:10:03,352 --> 00:10:05,771
-Goodness.
-How could this have happened?

140
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:07,064
What on earth happened?

141
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:15,990
Hi!

142
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:18,868
What brings you by?

143
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:21,912
I see life as an office worker
has been treating you well.

144
00:10:22,788 --> 00:10:25,916
Is that so? But why do you look like crap?

145
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:27,376
Are you exhausted?

146
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:30,004
I can't say your Korean getting better
is a good thing.

147
00:10:30,087 --> 00:10:32,298
I tried 100 raw eggs like you said

148
00:10:32,381 --> 00:10:34,884
and almost died
from endless crapping and vomiting.

149
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:36,636
How dare you?

150
00:10:38,012 --> 00:10:39,847
I never thought you'd actually do it.

151
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:43,434
Anyway, what happened here?

152
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:46,479
Someone knocked down the rebar.

153
00:10:48,189 --> 00:10:50,566
Was it you?

154
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:54,111
-Why would I?
-You're a repeat offender.

155
00:10:54,195 --> 00:10:55,529
You got caught stealing once,

156
00:10:55,613 --> 00:10:58,824
and you also crushed An Eun-ji.
I mean, Lee Myung-hee.

157
00:10:58,908 --> 00:11:00,743
It's a total mess,

158
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:03,120
and you're the only person
who could've done this.

159
00:11:03,204 --> 00:11:06,040
No one here at Doogo is as strong as you.

160
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:11,003
Even the cameras were off at the time.

161
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:12,505
Damn it.

162
00:11:13,255 --> 00:11:14,215
Anyway,

163
00:11:14,715 --> 00:11:17,093
what are you here to steal this time?

164
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:19,220
I don't steal anymore.

165
00:11:20,596 --> 00:11:22,932
You have no idea who did this?

166
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:24,850
Of course I don't.

167
00:11:24,934 --> 00:11:27,520
I'm covering it up quietly,
just as Mr. Ryu ordered me to.

168
00:11:31,607 --> 00:11:32,608
4885?

169
00:11:32,691 --> 00:11:33,859
Are you going to keep lingering?

170
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:37,238
That box labeled 4885.

171
00:11:37,321 --> 00:11:38,864
Isn't that a global shipment?

172
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:41,200
-What's in it?
-Why do you need to know that?

173
00:11:42,076 --> 00:11:43,494
Just get lost.

174
00:11:43,577 --> 00:11:45,121
You being here makes me anxious!

175
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:47,289
Tell me!

176
00:11:56,715 --> 00:11:58,259
-Hee-sik, you're back.
-Hey.

177
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:01,220
Check this out.

178
00:12:03,764 --> 00:12:07,435
The drug affects the sphenoid bone,
which is related to hormone production.

179
00:12:07,518 --> 00:12:09,895
It shrinks and causes
the cerebrospinal fluid to dry.

180
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:11,730
That's why the victims felt thirsty.

181
00:12:11,814 --> 00:12:14,442
Cerebrospinal fluid
is generally transparent,

182
00:12:14,525 --> 00:12:17,778
but the samples from the drug victims
were found to be red.

183
00:12:17,862 --> 00:12:20,990
Someone worth noting is Hong Jeong-ho,
a part-timer at Doogo.

184
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:21,907
The drug killed him.

185
00:12:22,658 --> 00:12:23,492
What?

186
00:12:25,286 --> 00:12:26,495
The report on his death said

187
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:29,623
he worked while only drinking water,
so I looked into it.

188
00:12:29,707 --> 00:12:31,542
The water part got me thinking,

189
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:33,961
and it was as suspected.

190
00:12:34,044 --> 00:12:36,630
Is the drug that prevalent in the country?

191
00:12:36,714 --> 00:12:40,634
It's being distributed in Korea
disguised in all shapes and sizes,

192
00:12:40,718 --> 00:12:43,262
including energy drinks.

193
00:12:43,345 --> 00:12:46,140
He was able to work
for three days straight without sleeping.

194
00:12:47,975 --> 00:12:49,768
We got a hit on the dump truck!

195
00:12:49,852 --> 00:12:50,853
Right.

196
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:52,813
-Do you have it?
-Yes.

197
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:56,942
It's a privately owned vehicle
as expected,

198
00:12:57,026 --> 00:12:58,110
and the license plate is fake.

199
00:12:58,194 --> 00:13:00,696
This was caught on camera
at Macheon-daero 35-gil

200
00:13:00,779 --> 00:13:02,281
around the time of the accident.

201
00:13:03,115 --> 00:13:05,367
The truck switched license plates.

202
00:13:08,496 --> 00:13:10,247
This alone is enough to arrest the driver

203
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:11,457
under the Road Traffic Act.

204
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:12,666
Right.

205
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:14,460
It's a shame
we can't see the driver's face.

206
00:13:14,543 --> 00:13:16,754
I'm sure the driver parked the car

207
00:13:16,837 --> 00:13:18,506
in an area without security cameras,

208
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:21,300
and the truck's owner
will switch the plates again.

209
00:13:37,566 --> 00:13:38,609
Hey.

210
00:13:38,692 --> 00:13:40,778
Why are you cooped up here
with the weird disguise?

211
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:43,197
Are you shooting a spy movie?

212
00:13:47,034 --> 00:13:47,952
Mom,

213
00:13:48,452 --> 00:13:51,705
I'm involved in something big.

214
00:13:51,789 --> 00:13:52,706
As in what?

215
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:55,084
A task to defeat the forces of evil.

216
00:13:55,751 --> 00:13:57,503
That's a load of crap.

217
00:13:57,586 --> 00:13:59,588
Take better care of your kid first!

218
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:01,090
Nam-in hasn't been at his café lately.

219
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:02,424
Something must be up.

220
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:03,884
I highly doubt it.

221
00:14:04,593 --> 00:14:06,303
He's been trying to lose weight.

222
00:14:06,387 --> 00:14:08,138
Good for him.

223
00:14:08,222 --> 00:14:09,807
He needs to shed a few pounds, Mom.

224
00:14:10,474 --> 00:14:12,560
I guess you're right about that.

225
00:14:12,643 --> 00:14:14,436
Anyway, what are you doing

226
00:14:15,312 --> 00:14:16,689
with a stand-in of all things?

227
00:14:17,273 --> 00:14:20,192
Some bastard tried to kill me.

228
00:14:20,276 --> 00:14:21,193
What?

229
00:14:21,944 --> 00:14:22,820
Who?

230
00:14:23,821 --> 00:14:26,198
Who is this bastard?

231
00:14:50,055 --> 00:14:50,890
Hello?

232
00:14:50,973 --> 00:14:53,559
It's me. It's just as I expected.

233
00:14:53,642 --> 00:14:56,729
Plate number 05M 3554.
It belongs to a dump truck.

234
00:14:56,812 --> 00:14:58,731
Grab the camera footage
at the three-way junction

235
00:14:58,814 --> 00:15:00,733
of Macheon-daero 34-gil.

236
00:15:00,816 --> 00:15:01,942
Will you be fine on your own?

237
00:15:02,026 --> 00:15:03,527
I have my own backup.

238
00:15:04,194 --> 00:15:05,863
Don't worry.

239
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:56,205
Requesting one female agent
at Geumju Hospital.

240
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:16,684
That's all the more reason
to show them you're completely fine.

241
00:16:16,767 --> 00:16:18,060
Why put on this silly show?

242
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:21,939
Both Zhuge Liang and Admiral Yi Sun-sin
requested their deaths to be kept secret.

243
00:16:22,022 --> 00:16:23,691
By lowering my adversary's guard,

244
00:16:23,774 --> 00:16:25,818
I'm playing my own hand to my advantage.

245
00:16:26,694 --> 00:16:27,903
It's exciting.

246
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:29,613
It's right up my alley.

247
00:16:29,697 --> 00:16:32,157
You've totally lost it. Good grief.

248
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:34,785
Now if you'll excuse me. I'm quite busy.

249
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:36,620
Right.

250
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:39,581
Mom,

251
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,876
Dad's having urgent surgery.

252
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:47,423
Remember what you taught me
while growing up?

253
00:16:48,048 --> 00:16:51,093
Our powers shouldn't be used
without rhyme or reason.

254
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:52,928
Otherwise, we could lose our powers.

255
00:16:56,223 --> 00:16:57,057
Look.

256
00:16:57,141 --> 00:16:58,308
I'm still just as strong.

257
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:01,103
It means I wasn't wrong to use my powers.

258
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:04,398
Even our ancestors agree
your father deserved it.

259
00:17:09,236 --> 00:17:10,529
You're right.

260
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:18,328
GEUMJU GROUP URGENT NOTICE

261
00:17:19,246 --> 00:17:21,915
Ms. Hwang has been hospitalized.

262
00:17:21,999 --> 00:17:23,709
As her recovery will take a while,

263
00:17:23,792 --> 00:17:25,878
her absence will be inevitable.

264
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:30,132
Please post any agendas of importance
on the website.

265
00:17:31,925 --> 00:17:33,552
SEND

266
00:17:33,635 --> 00:17:34,470
DM SENT!

267
00:17:42,269 --> 00:17:44,188
-Did you make a lot of rounds?
-I did.

268
00:17:44,772 --> 00:17:46,231
Be on top of the follow-up.

269
00:17:48,275 --> 00:17:50,486
Our business lies in the antidote.

270
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:52,738
-The antidote?
-That means we should only target

271
00:17:52,821 --> 00:17:56,116
the wealthy who are willing to pay up
to save their lives.

272
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,951
Of course. I'm well aware of that.

273
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:41,120
Ms. Hwang, the DM has been sent.

274
00:18:41,203 --> 00:18:42,162
Right.

275
00:18:44,915 --> 00:18:46,208
You don't need to worry.

276
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:47,126
Of course.

277
00:18:57,302 --> 00:18:58,178
Mr. Hwang.

278
00:18:58,262 --> 00:18:59,638
My dad…

279
00:19:01,014 --> 00:19:03,016
has finally returned.

280
00:19:03,767 --> 00:19:04,768
But…

281
00:19:07,104 --> 00:19:11,275
But my mom hit him.

282
00:19:11,358 --> 00:19:12,401
And now,

283
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:16,029
he's receiving surgery.

284
00:19:16,113 --> 00:19:17,030
Goodness.

285
00:19:17,114 --> 00:19:19,867
Then you should rush to the hospital
instead of sitting here.

286
00:19:20,534 --> 00:19:21,535
I'm…

287
00:19:22,077 --> 00:19:23,704
in distress.

288
00:19:24,788 --> 00:19:26,582
Just get to the hospital.

289
00:19:27,249 --> 00:19:28,250
Wait.

290
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:30,335
Please take me there.

291
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:33,630
I don't have any energy left in me.

292
00:19:33,714 --> 00:19:35,632
Go by yourself. Unbelievable.

293
00:19:40,721 --> 00:19:43,223
Mom, you should've held back.

294
00:19:43,307 --> 00:19:45,058
How could you hurt Dad…

295
00:19:45,142 --> 00:19:46,310
Dad…

296
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,107
He couldn't have been ruder.

297
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:53,984
Shall I book your next appointment?

298
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:56,612
No, there's no need for that.

299
00:19:58,906 --> 00:20:02,492
Why do you think Mr. Song
only takes on female clients?

300
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:05,871
He preys on their loneliness.

301
00:20:07,122 --> 00:20:10,042
It's pathetic to see women fall for it.

302
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:12,127
Are you going to resign, Ji-hye?

303
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:14,254
How did you know?

304
00:20:14,338 --> 00:20:18,217
Because you're suddenly objecting
despite having known how he was all along.

305
00:20:45,827 --> 00:20:47,913
Ms. Hwang Geum-ju is in the hospital!

306
00:20:49,289 --> 00:20:52,542
Is that so?
Did her appendix burst or something?

307
00:20:52,626 --> 00:20:55,128
No, it seems like
someone crashed into her car.

308
00:20:57,381 --> 00:20:59,549
It serves her right for running wild.

309
00:21:00,676 --> 00:21:01,551
You should visit.

310
00:21:01,635 --> 00:21:02,719
Why?

311
00:21:02,803 --> 00:21:03,971
It seems like a hit-and-run.

312
00:21:04,054 --> 00:21:05,847
The police might peg you as a suspect.

313
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:07,975
Why me?

314
00:21:08,058 --> 00:21:10,269
You two argued. You had her banished.

315
00:21:11,353 --> 00:21:14,022
"Banish Ms. Hwang
from our premises immediately."

316
00:21:15,899 --> 00:21:17,067
Why you little…

317
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:20,696
-You know what, Mr. Nam--
-Sir.

318
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:23,573
I doubt it'll help you or your business

319
00:21:23,657 --> 00:21:27,035
if you get investigated
as a suspect in her hit-and-run case.

320
00:21:49,891 --> 00:21:52,394
Mr. Kwon, why don't we go for drinks?

321
00:21:52,477 --> 00:21:53,312
Sure.

322
00:21:58,066 --> 00:22:00,402
4885…

323
00:22:00,485 --> 00:22:02,696
How can I intercept the shipment?

324
00:22:03,196 --> 00:22:05,032
How can I talk Manager Heo
into giving me answers?

325
00:22:05,115 --> 00:22:06,199
Should I seduce him?

326
00:22:06,283 --> 00:22:08,160
He's annoyed by me, so that won't work.

327
00:22:08,243 --> 00:22:09,161
I got it.

328
00:22:09,244 --> 00:22:10,996
Maybe I'll just say that I love him.

329
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:17,044
That always seems to work in K-dramas.

330
00:22:17,878 --> 00:22:19,671
Hillary, aren't you heading home?

331
00:22:19,755 --> 00:22:20,964
-I love you.
-What?

332
00:22:22,382 --> 00:22:23,925
Are you that fond of me?

333
00:22:24,843 --> 00:22:25,802
Yes.

334
00:22:26,595 --> 00:22:28,138
I'm heading out. See you tomorrow.

335
00:22:28,221 --> 00:22:29,389
Good night.

336
00:22:57,501 --> 00:22:58,502
Did you call for me?

337
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:08,053
Would you like to…

338
00:23:09,971 --> 00:23:11,473
have dinner with me?

339
00:23:12,849 --> 00:23:13,975
You bastard.

340
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:15,852
Why should I have a meal with you?

341
00:23:17,354 --> 00:23:19,856
-Are you hungry?
-To be true partners,

342
00:23:21,024 --> 00:23:22,609
we should get to know each other better.

343
00:23:26,029 --> 00:23:27,155
That sounds good to me.

344
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:28,406
What would you like to have?

345
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:30,033
How about Mongolian cuisine?

346
00:23:30,117 --> 00:23:31,284
That sounds good.

347
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:34,663
I like how you come to decisions quickly.

348
00:23:34,746 --> 00:23:35,997
I've always been speedy.

349
00:23:39,876 --> 00:23:41,670
I see. What's funny though…

350
00:23:41,753 --> 00:23:42,963
Can I order something pricey?

351
00:23:43,046 --> 00:23:44,923
-I went to the café.
-Sure.

352
00:23:45,006 --> 00:23:47,551
-He was so much uglier than I expected.
-Can I eat a lot?

353
00:23:47,634 --> 00:23:50,428
Listening in on two conversations
is driving me insane.

354
00:23:50,512 --> 00:23:51,429
My head hurts.

355
00:23:51,513 --> 00:23:53,223
Let me help. I'll take Nam-soon's.

356
00:23:53,306 --> 00:23:54,724
No way. Here you go.

357
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:01,148
Ryu Si-o seems to like Agent Gang,
doesn't he?

358
00:24:01,231 --> 00:24:02,691
See how he looks at her.

359
00:24:03,608 --> 00:24:04,943
Don't be ridiculous.

360
00:24:05,026 --> 00:24:06,570
Why would that jerk like her?

361
00:24:06,653 --> 00:24:08,822
Who are you throwing shade at?
Agent Gang or Ryu Si-o?

362
00:24:10,657 --> 00:24:12,075
-Let's go.
-Wait.

363
00:24:14,494 --> 00:24:16,329
Damn it, get your hands off her!

364
00:24:16,413 --> 00:24:20,167
How dare you? I'll twist your wrists off!

365
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:21,334
Let's go.

366
00:24:36,349 --> 00:24:37,475
Are you still unconscious?

367
00:24:37,559 --> 00:24:39,269
Which hospital are you at?

368
00:24:41,438 --> 00:24:44,858
He's something of an idiot
no matter how I look at it.

369
00:24:46,193 --> 00:24:48,820
Who texts an unconscious person?

370
00:24:50,530 --> 00:24:52,741
Yes. Bread Song.

371
00:24:53,783 --> 00:24:56,536
I'm pretty sure
he's in league with Ryu Si-o.

372
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,330
That's it.

373
00:24:58,914 --> 00:25:00,165
I'll set a trap.

374
00:25:05,545 --> 00:25:09,049
This is Ms. Hwang's secretary.

375
00:25:09,633 --> 00:25:15,305
Ms. Hwang is currently
in Room 707 at Geumju Hospital.

376
00:25:21,186 --> 00:25:22,229
I need some sugar.

377
00:25:34,866 --> 00:25:35,867
That's nice.

378
00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:41,206
Dad!

379
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:44,834
My gosh, Dad.

380
00:25:46,086 --> 00:25:47,587
In one, two, three.

381
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:52,259
Please be gentle.

382
00:25:53,677 --> 00:25:54,678
Thank you.

383
00:25:57,430 --> 00:25:58,348
Dad.

384
00:25:58,431 --> 00:26:00,642
Look at the state you're in.

385
00:26:05,188 --> 00:26:06,731
Unbelievable.

386
00:26:06,815 --> 00:26:07,691
Here.

387
00:26:10,694 --> 00:26:11,736
Dad.

388
00:26:15,782 --> 00:26:16,741
Dad.

389
00:26:19,703 --> 00:26:20,996
Dad…

390
00:26:24,874 --> 00:26:26,626
That's enough, Geum-dong.

391
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:28,295
He just got out of surgery.

392
00:26:28,837 --> 00:26:30,255
Wait until he wakes up.

393
00:26:31,756 --> 00:26:35,010
Where did Mom go
after putting him in this state?

394
00:27:15,675 --> 00:27:17,677
Lamb chops and khorkhog?

395
00:27:19,429 --> 00:27:22,265
We'll have everything
from lamb chops to khorkhog.

396
00:27:23,892 --> 00:27:25,477
How about Bolor for our drinks?

397
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:26,853
Soyombo.

398
00:27:26,936 --> 00:27:29,064
It's my favorite Mongolian vodka.

399
00:27:29,147 --> 00:27:30,231
We'll take that.

400
00:27:37,947 --> 00:27:38,865
Cheers.

401
00:27:52,003 --> 00:27:54,923
So tell me. Where's your hometown?

402
00:27:55,006 --> 00:27:55,965
Where were you born?

403
00:27:56,049 --> 00:27:57,133
I don't know.

404
00:27:58,218 --> 00:27:59,552
Probably somewhere in Korea.

405
00:27:59,636 --> 00:28:00,804
I was abandoned as a child.

406
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:09,187
I went to Russia at the age of five.

407
00:28:10,647 --> 00:28:11,606
Were you adopted?

408
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:13,733
It's something like that.

409
00:28:13,817 --> 00:28:16,694
Then who raised you?

410
00:28:16,778 --> 00:28:20,198
It's not as if you lived alone
in the woods like a wolf.

411
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:28,832
That would've been a better option.

412
00:28:33,336 --> 00:28:34,170
Tsetseg,

413
00:28:35,213 --> 00:28:36,381
it's about time you told me.

414
00:28:36,965 --> 00:28:38,383
What's the story

415
00:28:40,009 --> 00:28:41,052
behind your super strength?

416
00:28:46,516 --> 00:28:48,560
The strength runs in the family.

417
00:28:49,894 --> 00:28:53,523
My mom is incredibly strong as well.

418
00:28:56,776 --> 00:29:00,822
My Mongolian mom would bathe
my horse Ppappa in her arms.

419
00:29:00,905 --> 00:29:03,867
She lived on mountain goat milk
and mutton all her life.

420
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:06,202
That's what made her strong,
and I grew up eating that too.

421
00:29:08,872 --> 00:29:10,081
I envy you.

422
00:29:11,416 --> 00:29:12,834
You inherited your strength

423
00:29:13,501 --> 00:29:14,335
and…

424
00:29:15,545 --> 00:29:17,005
were raised by nice parents.

425
00:29:20,967 --> 00:29:22,385
Do you wish to be strong?

426
00:29:23,678 --> 00:29:24,554
Then eat these.

427
00:29:25,221 --> 00:29:27,265
Lamb chops.

428
00:29:31,561 --> 00:29:33,146
This one is for me.

429
00:29:34,063 --> 00:29:35,815
Dig in already.

430
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:38,443
Go at it with your hands.

431
00:29:39,319 --> 00:29:41,279
He sure is handsome, isn't he?

432
00:29:41,362 --> 00:29:42,655
How is he handsome?

433
00:29:42,739 --> 00:29:44,282
It says "drugs" all over his face.

434
00:29:44,365 --> 00:29:47,410
That's what I mean.
What could be more alluring than drugs?

435
00:29:47,494 --> 00:29:49,829
Nam-soon's great at acting, isn't she?

436
00:29:49,913 --> 00:29:51,498
She's gifted.
Maybe she should be an actor.

437
00:29:51,581 --> 00:29:53,166
Nonsense. She's holding back her anger.

438
00:29:53,249 --> 00:29:55,335
Shoot. I can't hold my bladder any longer.

439
00:29:56,044 --> 00:29:58,087
She's smiling at the man
who tried to kill her mom.

440
00:29:58,838 --> 00:30:02,175
Agent Gang is talented.
She has a bright future ahead of her.

441
00:30:02,258 --> 00:30:04,969
Remember how she brought up
how Ryu does drugs to the bodyguard?

442
00:30:05,053 --> 00:30:08,014
She's one smooth conversationalist.

443
00:30:08,097 --> 00:30:11,726
I'm sure there's a codeword they use
to refer to drugs.

444
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:13,269
-Paul.
-Right, Paul.

445
00:30:15,605 --> 00:30:18,608
Did you manage to pick that up
while listening to both conversations?

446
00:30:18,691 --> 00:30:21,653
Officer Yeo transcribed the recordings,
so I went through them all night.

447
00:30:21,736 --> 00:30:22,862
That's right.

448
00:30:23,363 --> 00:30:24,864
We teamed up with the precinct.

449
00:30:25,573 --> 00:30:26,407
That reminds me.

450
00:30:26,491 --> 00:30:28,576
Remember how the team leader
was helping the Busan DIU out?

451
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:31,412
Their unit leader called
and said he never got there.

452
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:32,664
-He didn't show up?
-No.

453
00:30:32,747 --> 00:30:33,623
He didn't.

454
00:30:36,501 --> 00:30:37,669
His phone is off.

455
00:30:37,752 --> 00:30:40,630
I left him messages,
but he hasn't called back.

456
00:30:57,313 --> 00:30:58,481
We have nothing.

457
00:31:00,942 --> 00:31:02,402
-Let's just drink.
-Yes, let's drink.

458
00:31:10,535 --> 00:31:12,161
Excuse me, sir.

459
00:31:12,245 --> 00:31:13,329
Sir!

460
00:31:14,497 --> 00:31:15,582
Sir!

461
00:31:18,585 --> 00:31:20,920
Hey.

462
00:31:22,255 --> 00:31:24,883
What do you think you're doing?

463
00:31:28,094 --> 00:31:29,053
Sir!

464
00:31:32,223 --> 00:31:34,851
Hey!

465
00:31:37,395 --> 00:31:38,438
Hey!

466
00:31:38,938 --> 00:31:39,939
Sir.

467
00:31:50,241 --> 00:31:51,242
Over there.

468
00:31:53,369 --> 00:31:54,746
We need to call the police.

469
00:31:54,829 --> 00:31:56,331
There's something wrong with him.

470
00:31:57,582 --> 00:31:59,000
Hey, he's a cop.

471
00:32:14,474 --> 00:32:15,516
By the way, Si-o,

472
00:32:16,059 --> 00:32:18,895
I'm curious about the items
that Doogo exports.

473
00:32:19,812 --> 00:32:21,105
Just a second.

474
00:32:24,817 --> 00:32:25,902
Hello?

475
00:32:26,486 --> 00:32:27,570
Yes.

476
00:32:28,237 --> 00:32:29,781
It will be shipped out sometime tomorrow.

477
00:32:31,699 --> 00:32:33,034
Don't worry.

478
00:32:33,534 --> 00:32:36,746
The shipment of CTA4885

479
00:32:36,829 --> 00:32:39,457
will reach you safe and sound.

480
00:32:48,633 --> 00:32:50,468
-Are you done?
-Yes.

481
00:32:50,551 --> 00:32:52,345
Then let me take you home.

482
00:32:52,428 --> 00:32:54,847
Home? As in where I live?

483
00:33:04,232 --> 00:33:05,566
Go to my place.

484
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:07,235
You remember the address
and passcode, right?

485
00:33:12,407 --> 00:33:13,783
-Hop in.
-Okay.

486
00:33:24,252 --> 00:33:26,045
Korea's prettier at night.

487
00:33:26,879 --> 00:33:28,089
Look at how it sparkles.

488
00:33:29,465 --> 00:33:30,591
Do you know why that is?

489
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:32,844
That's because

490
00:33:33,344 --> 00:33:35,179
more things happen at night
than you can imagine.

491
00:33:36,556 --> 00:33:37,890
The light has to shine bright enough

492
00:33:38,683 --> 00:33:40,435
to hide it all in the shadows.

493
00:33:41,102 --> 00:33:42,937
But that kind of light isn't real.

494
00:33:44,439 --> 00:33:45,606
It's fake.

495
00:33:46,733 --> 00:33:50,528
I can tell which kind of light is real
and which is fake.

496
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:53,281
Which am I?

497
00:33:53,781 --> 00:33:55,199
Real…

498
00:33:56,284 --> 00:33:57,577
or fake?

499
00:33:59,078 --> 00:34:00,371
I should answer this wisely.

500
00:34:00,455 --> 00:34:01,372
What do I say?

501
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:05,918
Are you wondering what to say?

502
00:34:06,002 --> 00:34:07,920
Jeez, you must be a genius.

503
00:34:13,301 --> 00:34:17,221
You're a light that's not sure
if it's real or fake

504
00:34:17,305 --> 00:34:20,058
but could be real if it tries hard enough.

505
00:34:33,362 --> 00:34:34,906
Is this your place?

506
00:34:35,573 --> 00:34:37,492
No, a friend's.

507
00:34:37,575 --> 00:34:38,826
I've been mooching off.

508
00:34:39,786 --> 00:34:40,745
"Mooching off"?

509
00:34:41,621 --> 00:34:42,663
Where's the house?

510
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:49,545
Way over there…

511
00:34:49,629 --> 00:34:50,505
on the fifth floor.

512
00:34:53,716 --> 00:34:55,468
Now shoo.

513
00:34:56,302 --> 00:34:57,345
Shoo.

514
00:34:58,596 --> 00:35:00,515
-I'll get going.
-Sure. Off you go.

515
00:35:01,307 --> 00:35:02,350
Shoo.

516
00:35:04,185 --> 00:35:05,103
Go on.

517
00:35:25,373 --> 00:35:29,585
You're a light that's not sure
if it's real or fake

518
00:35:29,669 --> 00:35:32,296
but could be real if it tries hard enough.

519
00:35:41,013 --> 00:35:42,306
Kill him.

520
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:44,767
Traitors are killed
by their former comrades.

521
00:35:45,434 --> 00:35:46,769
That's the Pavel way.

522
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:53,526
Kill him!

523
00:35:54,193 --> 00:35:55,153
Kill him already!

524
00:36:57,089 --> 00:36:58,799
I haven't felt this tipsy in a while.

525
00:37:02,094 --> 00:37:02,929
Dad?

526
00:37:03,596 --> 00:37:05,848
Dad, have you come to?

527
00:37:05,932 --> 00:37:07,642
Yes. My goodness.

528
00:37:08,434 --> 00:37:09,268
Dad.

529
00:37:09,352 --> 00:37:10,311
Geum-ju.

530
00:37:10,394 --> 00:37:11,312
Yes, Dad.

531
00:37:11,395 --> 00:37:12,313
Geum-dong.

532
00:37:12,396 --> 00:37:13,481
Yes, Dad.

533
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:15,149
You two…

534
00:37:18,653 --> 00:37:19,987
sure have gotten old.

535
00:37:26,118 --> 00:37:27,620
Seriously, Dad.

536
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:30,164
What took you so long to come home?

537
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:32,875
Geum-ju, Geum-dong…

538
00:37:34,585 --> 00:37:35,795
I'm sorry.

539
00:37:35,878 --> 00:37:39,674
Where were you
and what have you been up to?

540
00:37:39,757 --> 00:37:42,510
At first, I left to find Nam-soon.

541
00:37:43,135 --> 00:37:45,263
That's why I went to Mongolia.

542
00:37:45,846 --> 00:37:48,808
My dear granddaughter
loved being up in high places.

543
00:37:50,059 --> 00:37:52,311
So I traveled to higher locations,

544
00:37:52,895 --> 00:37:54,021
climbing further up as I went.

545
00:37:54,105 --> 00:37:56,983
I looked for her in places
that were close to the sky.

546
00:37:57,066 --> 00:38:01,904
Lhasa in Tibet is known to sit
at the highest altitude in the world.

547
00:38:01,988 --> 00:38:02,989
I thought that must be it.

548
00:38:03,572 --> 00:38:07,243
I was so sure Nam-soon would be there.

549
00:38:07,326 --> 00:38:09,787
There, I met a guru.

550
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:13,249
That's when I realized
that it was the will of the heavens.

551
00:38:13,332 --> 00:38:16,252
The higher powers must've brought me there

552
00:38:16,335 --> 00:38:18,087
so that I could pray for Nam-soon.

553
00:38:18,754 --> 00:38:22,925
However, the heavens didn't help
relieve me of my bowel issues.

554
00:38:23,926 --> 00:38:26,387
Then came another revelation.

555
00:38:27,763 --> 00:38:29,432
The higher powers were telling me

556
00:38:30,266 --> 00:38:32,143
to eat Korean food.

557
00:38:32,685 --> 00:38:34,937
They were telling me
to rush back to Korea.

558
00:38:35,021 --> 00:38:35,980
Hold it.

559
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:41,319
You made your way to Tibet
to look for Nam-soon?

560
00:38:41,402 --> 00:38:42,320
Yes.

561
00:38:42,403 --> 00:38:44,447
Why didn't you tell us?

562
00:38:45,698 --> 00:38:48,909
We thought you had left home
just to abandon us.

563
00:38:48,993 --> 00:38:50,745
So you didn't just abandon us.

564
00:38:50,828 --> 00:38:52,371
You abandoned worldly comforts.

565
00:38:52,455 --> 00:38:53,748
Do you have any idea

566
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:56,709
how much Mom resented you?

567
00:38:56,792 --> 00:39:00,046
I was going to return
with Nam-soon in my arms.

568
00:39:00,129 --> 00:39:01,881
But…

569
00:39:01,964 --> 00:39:03,382
We found Nam-soon, Dad.

570
00:39:03,966 --> 00:39:07,511
-What?
-Nam-soon came back to us.

571
00:39:07,595 --> 00:39:08,804
Really?

572
00:39:12,058 --> 00:39:13,642
Did you truly find Nam-soon?

573
00:39:13,726 --> 00:39:15,186
Yes, we did.

574
00:39:15,269 --> 00:39:16,354
It's true.

575
00:39:19,315 --> 00:39:20,858
What is he saying?

576
00:39:20,941 --> 00:39:22,777
Oh, Vajrasattva,

577
00:39:23,611 --> 00:39:25,613
allow me to keep my vows.

578
00:39:27,865 --> 00:39:29,075
At long last,

579
00:39:29,158 --> 00:39:31,202
I may stay by your mom's side

580
00:39:32,078 --> 00:39:33,954
and enjoy the rest of our lives together.

581
00:39:40,002 --> 00:39:41,003
You should lie back down.

582
00:39:42,296 --> 00:39:43,506
Be careful!

583
00:39:50,304 --> 00:39:51,972
Your name may mean "in the middle,"

584
00:39:55,142 --> 00:39:57,228
but there's nothing moderate about you,

585
00:39:58,396 --> 00:39:59,522
my dear Joong-gan.

586
00:40:02,149 --> 00:40:03,109
I swear…

587
00:40:04,819 --> 00:40:07,947
I cannot give up on you, Joon-gan.

588
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:10,366
No,

589
00:40:11,659 --> 00:40:12,493
I won't.

590
00:40:14,203 --> 00:40:17,373
Let me take care of everything.

591
00:40:18,124 --> 00:40:20,960
I'll sort this all out.

592
00:41:12,678 --> 00:41:13,512
I…

593
00:41:14,221 --> 00:41:15,139
Well,

594
00:41:15,806 --> 00:41:19,059
I was only trying to
get something off your lips.

595
00:41:21,604 --> 00:41:22,646
I see.

596
00:41:22,730 --> 00:41:24,356
Right. What exactly is that?

597
00:41:25,524 --> 00:41:28,777
What I'm trying to say is
that it wasn't intentional.

598
00:41:28,861 --> 00:41:31,572
Got it. Likewise.

599
00:41:35,075 --> 00:41:36,827
Hey, your phone buzzed.

600
00:41:42,374 --> 00:41:43,459
It's from Ryu Si-o.

601
00:41:46,003 --> 00:41:47,004
Good night.

602
00:41:47,087 --> 00:41:48,130
Are you kidding me?

603
00:41:48,214 --> 00:41:49,215
"Good night"?

604
00:41:57,598 --> 00:42:01,393
You know, I'm sure
that Ryu Si-o consumes the drug.

605
00:42:01,477 --> 00:42:03,687
I've seen him wield his super strength.

606
00:42:08,317 --> 00:42:10,194
Someone knocked down the rebar.

607
00:42:10,277 --> 00:42:12,321
Why isn't he affected by it though?

608
00:42:12,905 --> 00:42:14,156
I haven't seen him drink water.

609
00:42:14,782 --> 00:42:16,784
Our business lies in the antidote.

610
00:42:18,077 --> 00:42:20,538
I heard them talking about an antidote.

611
00:42:21,205 --> 00:42:22,581
An antidote?

612
00:42:22,665 --> 00:42:23,499
Yes.

613
00:42:23,582 --> 00:42:25,668
I think that's part of their operation.

614
00:42:29,547 --> 00:42:32,633
CTA4885 will be shipped out tomorrow.

615
00:42:33,342 --> 00:42:34,468
We have to intercept it.

616
00:42:34,552 --> 00:42:36,762
Got it. Don't you worry.

617
00:42:46,021 --> 00:42:46,897
I…

618
00:42:48,607 --> 00:42:50,651
I'm so hungry after skipping dinner.

619
00:42:51,443 --> 00:42:52,611
Where are my instant noodles?

620
00:43:09,878 --> 00:43:11,046
Are you feeling peckish too?

621
00:43:11,130 --> 00:43:12,131
Peckish?

622
00:43:13,132 --> 00:43:15,175
But you already gave me one earlier.

623
00:43:15,259 --> 00:43:16,468
A peck.

624
00:43:17,970 --> 00:43:20,097
Everything's a joke to you, isn't it?

625
00:43:23,142 --> 00:43:24,643
That looks good.

626
00:43:24,727 --> 00:43:25,978
I'd like some.

627
00:43:29,982 --> 00:43:31,650
Can I have a bite?

628
00:43:33,485 --> 00:43:34,403
Come sit next to me.

629
00:43:38,282 --> 00:43:39,533
Do that again.

630
00:43:40,326 --> 00:43:41,827
"Can I have some?"

631
00:43:42,369 --> 00:43:43,537
Can I have some?

632
00:43:56,550 --> 00:43:57,593
There you go.

633
00:43:58,385 --> 00:44:00,054
Now go. I'm not sharing my noodles.

634
00:44:04,933 --> 00:44:05,851
What a bummer.

635
00:44:25,996 --> 00:44:29,625
DONGHWA BANK 110-385-82385

636
00:44:29,708 --> 00:44:33,337
NO RESULTS FOUND

637
00:44:35,047 --> 00:44:36,757
What on earth is this?

638
00:44:45,432 --> 00:44:48,560
QUICK WEIGHT LOSS

639
00:44:48,644 --> 00:44:49,937
NO RESULTS FOUND

640
00:45:00,531 --> 00:45:03,659
Ms. Hwang has set up
a place for you to stay.

641
00:45:10,332 --> 00:45:13,252
This is a golf practice facility
that she owns.

642
00:45:13,836 --> 00:45:16,797
It's where you'll be working
for the time being.

643
00:45:17,965 --> 00:45:21,427
She said to make yourself at home
until you get back on your feet.

644
00:45:27,141 --> 00:45:28,392
It's a nice facility.

645
00:45:29,017 --> 00:45:30,769
A lawyer has been appointed for you.

646
00:45:30,853 --> 00:45:34,148
We'll do everything we can
to keep you out of prison.

647
00:45:34,940 --> 00:45:37,568
We've dropped the charges
against you on our end,

648
00:45:37,651 --> 00:45:39,278
but the prosecution will indict you

649
00:45:40,112 --> 00:45:42,156
because a weapon was found at the scene.

650
00:45:44,867 --> 00:45:45,868
You should know…

651
00:45:47,536 --> 00:45:49,329
that Doogo's CEO came to see me.

652
00:45:50,247 --> 00:45:53,333
It was as if he knew
that Nam-soon was Tsetseg.

653
00:45:54,460 --> 00:45:57,629
He asked who Hwang Geum-ju's daughter was.

654
00:45:59,089 --> 00:46:00,174
And?

655
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:02,759
I lied.

656
00:46:04,470 --> 00:46:05,596
You did the right thing.

657
00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:11,268
Please let me know
if you have any further questions.

658
00:46:13,228 --> 00:46:14,062
All right.

659
00:46:28,952 --> 00:46:29,870
Which room is she in?

660
00:46:29,953 --> 00:46:31,079
Room 707.

661
00:46:31,163 --> 00:46:32,539
She's in a lucky room.

662
00:46:38,921 --> 00:46:40,672
Only family may enter.

663
00:46:54,770 --> 00:46:55,687
Ma'am.

664
00:46:56,230 --> 00:46:58,357
Mr. Bread Song is asking to see her.

665
00:46:58,440 --> 00:46:59,775
Yes, ma'am.

666
00:47:01,068 --> 00:47:01,902
You may enter.

667
00:47:22,256 --> 00:47:25,842
Myung-hee was sent to stay
at the residence you set up for her.

668
00:47:26,385 --> 00:47:27,219
By the way,

669
00:47:27,302 --> 00:47:31,265
Doogo's CEO apparently
asked her about Nam-soon.

670
00:47:31,765 --> 00:47:34,351
It seems he had suspicions
that Tsetseg could be Nam-soon,

671
00:47:35,394 --> 00:47:37,479
but Myung-hee told him otherwise.

672
00:47:40,315 --> 00:47:41,149
Right.

673
00:47:42,192 --> 00:47:44,027
Tell her I'll visit sometime soon.

674
00:47:44,611 --> 00:47:45,445
Yes, ma'am.

675
00:47:46,530 --> 00:47:50,784
Also, Bread Song
just entered your hospital room.

676
00:47:50,867 --> 00:47:52,661
Don't you think he'll figure it out?

677
00:47:53,412 --> 00:47:55,789
-Even with all the bandages--
-He won't.

678
00:47:57,332 --> 00:47:59,209
They're stupider than you think.

679
00:48:07,509 --> 00:48:08,885
Her injuries are severe.

680
00:48:10,721 --> 00:48:12,180
Her face has gotten bigger.

681
00:48:13,307 --> 00:48:14,933
Hey, get me a peach drink.

682
00:48:15,017 --> 00:48:15,976
Yes, sir.

683
00:48:17,477 --> 00:48:18,687
Ms. Hwang,

684
00:48:18,770 --> 00:48:21,356
what a devastating accident you were in.

685
00:48:22,691 --> 00:48:24,401
I feel terrible.

686
00:48:24,484 --> 00:48:25,402
Here you go, sir.

687
00:48:26,111 --> 00:48:26,945
Right.

688
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:30,949
I banished you from my office
the other day and…

689
00:48:36,413 --> 00:48:38,707
How on earth
did something like this happen?

690
00:48:38,790 --> 00:48:40,250
You should've been more careful.

691
00:48:58,935 --> 00:49:00,771
Anyway, I wish you a speedy recovery,

692
00:49:00,854 --> 00:49:03,690
and I hope to see you again
back in full health.

693
00:49:03,774 --> 00:49:04,733
Then,

694
00:49:05,317 --> 00:49:07,027
we'll leave you to rest.

695
00:49:09,029 --> 00:49:10,197
Are we leaving so soon?

696
00:49:10,864 --> 00:49:11,865
Come on.

697
00:49:13,825 --> 00:49:14,826
But, sir…

698
00:49:18,789 --> 00:49:21,500
I've heard about stand-ins
for CEOs and corporations,

699
00:49:21,583 --> 00:49:23,335
but not stand-ins for patients.

700
00:49:23,418 --> 00:49:24,503
A stand-in?

701
00:49:28,173 --> 00:49:29,424
She isn't Hwang Geum-ju.

702
00:49:30,467 --> 00:49:31,968
-What?
-She's a fake.

703
00:49:33,762 --> 00:49:35,222
How could you tell?

704
00:49:35,305 --> 00:49:36,723
Once I meet a woman,

705
00:49:36,807 --> 00:49:40,060
I can draw her body
even with my eyes closed.

706
00:49:41,353 --> 00:49:43,438
I may not be able to draw
a map of our country,

707
00:49:43,522 --> 00:49:45,190
but I can draw a woman's body.

708
00:49:45,273 --> 00:49:47,192
So how did you figure it out?

709
00:49:48,151 --> 00:49:48,985
Those weren't…

710
00:49:51,029 --> 00:49:52,406
Hwang Geum-ju's nostrils.

711
00:49:52,989 --> 00:49:54,074
Her nostrils?

712
00:49:54,157 --> 00:49:58,870
When I look at women,
I map out the details of their nostrils.

713
00:50:00,872 --> 00:50:01,832
I'm sorry, sir.

714
00:50:01,915 --> 00:50:03,041
One's nostrils

715
00:50:04,084 --> 00:50:05,794
tell me what their assets are worth.

716
00:50:05,877 --> 00:50:08,213
When did you get
such a close look at her nostrils?

717
00:50:08,296 --> 00:50:10,465
Anyway, that woman isn't Hwang Geum-ju.

718
00:50:12,175 --> 00:50:15,303
But I don't get why
she's putting on this weird show.

719
00:50:16,555 --> 00:50:17,806
I just don't get

720
00:50:19,266 --> 00:50:20,559
that woman at all.

721
00:50:26,857 --> 00:50:28,024
Mom.

722
00:50:30,318 --> 00:50:31,903
Is my daughter off to work?

723
00:50:32,529 --> 00:50:34,656
I have an important mission today.

724
00:50:34,740 --> 00:50:35,782
So I heard.

725
00:50:35,866 --> 00:50:38,785
Inspector Kang briefs me
on the investigation every day.

726
00:50:40,245 --> 00:50:41,163
Come sit here.

727
00:50:43,457 --> 00:50:46,042
Did you stay out overnight yesterday?

728
00:50:48,754 --> 00:50:50,547
What about it?

729
00:50:51,089 --> 00:50:53,258
Ryu Si-o asked Myung-hee

730
00:50:53,925 --> 00:50:56,595
if Tsetseg was Gang Nam-soon.

731
00:50:59,222 --> 00:51:01,808
We'll get caught
if we keep spending time together.

732
00:51:03,143 --> 00:51:04,770
Stay at his place if you can.

733
00:51:05,854 --> 00:51:10,400
One thing can lead to another,
and you may end up living together.

734
00:51:11,234 --> 00:51:12,194
Kill two birds with one stone.

735
00:51:12,277 --> 00:51:13,361
Get everything in one fell swoop.

736
00:51:13,445 --> 00:51:15,864
Be around your sweetheart
and make him yours too.

737
00:51:17,491 --> 00:51:19,659
I'll make Gan I-sik mine.

738
00:51:20,494 --> 00:51:21,620
I'll bring him home

739
00:51:22,162 --> 00:51:23,538
after taking the proper steps.

740
00:51:29,127 --> 00:51:31,671
She's my daughter for sure.

741
00:51:32,339 --> 00:51:33,298
She's so adorable.

742
00:51:33,799 --> 00:51:35,509
If we get there first,

743
00:51:36,176 --> 00:51:37,260
we'll wait here.

744
00:51:37,344 --> 00:51:38,386
Okay.

745
00:51:38,470 --> 00:51:40,263
You'll cover Agent Gang's escape route.

746
00:51:40,347 --> 00:51:41,306
I'll take the truck.

747
00:51:41,389 --> 00:51:42,349
Okay.

748
00:51:45,393 --> 00:51:47,938
Inspector Kang,
someone's asking for you downstairs.

749
00:51:48,021 --> 00:51:49,105
Got it.

750
00:51:56,446 --> 00:51:58,114
-Mr. Gang.
-Hey.

751
00:51:59,991 --> 00:52:01,034
What brings you here?

752
00:52:01,117 --> 00:52:02,661
Well…

753
00:52:04,454 --> 00:52:05,831
Please come this way.

754
00:52:06,414 --> 00:52:07,958
This is Nam-in's weight-loss pill.

755
00:52:08,959 --> 00:52:10,126
Something's off about it.

756
00:52:11,503 --> 00:52:13,129
Ever since he started taking these,

757
00:52:13,213 --> 00:52:15,173
he's been living only on water.

758
00:52:15,257 --> 00:52:18,134
He was passed out on the floor,
lips completely dry,

759
00:52:18,218 --> 00:52:19,845
as if he hadn't had water for days.

760
00:52:19,928 --> 00:52:20,887
Since when?

761
00:52:21,805 --> 00:52:22,806
How much did he drink?

762
00:52:22,889 --> 00:52:25,225
He drank at least two liters at a time.

763
00:52:25,892 --> 00:52:28,895
He's growing more gaunt by the day.
This pill must be causing it.

764
00:52:29,396 --> 00:52:31,815
Can you analyze what it's made of?

765
00:52:32,649 --> 00:52:33,859
That's what I came to ask.

766
00:52:37,946 --> 00:52:39,531
This is Kang Hee-sik of the DIU.

767
00:52:40,532 --> 00:52:41,992
I'd like to request an analysis.

768
00:52:43,535 --> 00:52:45,161
Could you do it right away?

769
00:52:49,499 --> 00:52:50,667
-Mr. Kwon.
-Yes?

770
00:52:50,750 --> 00:52:52,294
-Let's check this.
-Yes, sir.

771
00:52:55,630 --> 00:52:56,673
Look.

772
00:52:56,756 --> 00:52:59,593
It's not as if
this is your first time doing this.

773
00:52:59,676 --> 00:53:00,760
Ms. Baek.

774
00:53:00,844 --> 00:53:04,180
When will the cargo be shipped out today?

775
00:53:05,557 --> 00:53:07,517
Let me see.

776
00:53:07,601 --> 00:53:09,394
At 12:30 p.m.

777
00:53:10,979 --> 00:53:14,274
I'm going to step out for a bit.

778
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:16,902
Can you cover for me
if Si-o asks where I am?

779
00:53:17,569 --> 00:53:19,696
-"Si-o"?
-Yeah, the CEO.

780
00:53:19,779 --> 00:53:21,865
Oh, you mean Mr. Ryu.

781
00:53:24,117 --> 00:53:25,285
I still can't get used to this.

782
00:53:25,368 --> 00:53:27,704
You call him Si-o. Unbelievable.

783
00:53:27,787 --> 00:53:28,830
Anyway,

784
00:53:29,331 --> 00:53:32,042
I won't be gone long,
so please cover for me.

785
00:53:33,460 --> 00:53:36,129
I'll pick up jumbo dumplings
on my way back.

786
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:38,590
How did you know I like them?

787
00:53:38,673 --> 00:53:41,718
You only post photos of dumplings
on your social media account.

788
00:53:42,469 --> 00:53:44,554
Even your dog is named Mandu,
which means "dumpling."

789
00:53:44,638 --> 00:53:46,097
I know because I follow you.

790
00:53:54,481 --> 00:53:55,857
-Kimchi dumplings.
-Dumplings.

791
00:54:29,099 --> 00:54:31,393
But that's not where the shipments go.

GANGHAN POLICE PRECINCT

793
00:55:55,226 --> 00:55:56,478
Hey, it's making a left.

794
00:55:56,561 --> 00:55:57,771
I'll drive ahead.

795
00:56:10,283 --> 00:56:11,868
Okay.

796
00:56:28,802 --> 00:56:30,428
Are you kidding me?

797
00:56:31,262 --> 00:56:32,680
Hey, do you have a death wish?

798
00:56:35,934 --> 00:56:36,810
Hey, handsome.

799
00:56:38,978 --> 00:56:40,271
Babe, can you help me?

800
00:56:50,323 --> 00:56:51,282
What's wrong?

801
00:56:51,866 --> 00:56:52,909
What is it?

802
00:56:52,992 --> 00:56:55,537
My car must've broken down.

803
00:56:55,620 --> 00:56:56,871
It won't budge.

804
00:57:00,500 --> 00:57:02,001
Damn, I'm busy as it is.

805
00:57:02,085 --> 00:57:03,253
Come on.

806
00:57:06,756 --> 00:57:08,383
You can help me,

807
00:57:09,634 --> 00:57:10,677
right?

808
00:57:13,304 --> 00:57:14,305
Let me take a look.

809
00:57:24,232 --> 00:57:25,358
What the…

810
00:57:30,071 --> 00:57:31,030
What is this?

811
00:57:38,663 --> 00:57:40,999
I'll try starting the car, babe.

812
00:57:41,499 --> 00:57:42,834
-Thanks.
-What?

These are duck feathers.

815
00:58:08,776 --> 00:58:09,819
Let's get some water.

816
00:58:23,583 --> 00:58:24,584
-Paul.
-Paul.

817
00:58:26,669 --> 00:58:30,173
Mr. Ryu's been looking for you,
asking me where you went.

818
00:58:30,256 --> 00:58:33,384
So I told him I sent you to see a doctor
because you looked off.

MISSED CALLS

KANG HEE-SIK

821
00:59:05,208 --> 00:59:07,293
-Hello?
-I ran the test as you asked.

822
00:59:07,919 --> 00:59:08,920
The weight-loss pill

823
00:59:09,796 --> 00:59:10,964
is a narcotic.

824
00:59:11,047 --> 00:59:13,299
It's a synthetic drug,
just like the baby formula.

825
00:59:21,432 --> 00:59:24,102
Yes, Inspector Kang. What is this about?

826
00:59:24,185 --> 00:59:25,436
Mr. Gang asked me

827
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:29,315
to run an analysis on
the weight-loss pill Nam-in's been taking.

828
00:59:33,319 --> 00:59:34,153
And?

829
00:59:34,862 --> 00:59:35,989
That weight-loss pill…

830
00:59:38,700 --> 00:59:39,701
is a narcotic.

831
01:00:06,394 --> 01:00:08,313
Why did you keep calling me?

832
01:00:08,396 --> 01:00:09,355
Is something up?

833
01:00:14,694 --> 01:00:16,321
Why do you think I called you here?

834
01:00:17,947 --> 01:00:18,781
What?

835
01:00:30,293 --> 01:00:31,127
Goodness!

836
01:00:41,679 --> 01:00:42,680
Would you like…

837
01:00:44,766 --> 01:00:45,892
to go out with me?

838
01:01:27,016 --> 01:01:29,394
STRONG GIRL NAM-SOON

839
01:01:29,477 --> 01:01:30,353
He needs a hospital.

840
01:01:30,436 --> 01:01:32,772
I'll kill whoever did this to Nam-in.

841
01:01:32,855 --> 01:01:34,732
It's me. Get me the antidote.

842
01:01:34,816 --> 01:01:37,068
I don't get your mother at all!

843
01:01:37,151 --> 01:01:39,612
It's about Tsetseg.
She didn't come to work today.

844
01:01:39,696 --> 01:01:41,364
Why aren't you at the office
without calling in?

845
01:01:41,447 --> 01:01:42,532
Come to my place now.

846
01:01:42,615 --> 01:01:44,325
The brown journal on the second bookshelf.

847
01:01:44,409 --> 01:01:47,870
No cop is more pissed off
than one who just lost a fellow cop.

848
01:01:47,954 --> 01:01:49,747
Come along quietly
if you don't want to die.

849
01:01:49,831 --> 01:01:51,666
This is the search and seizure warrant
for Doogo.

850
01:01:51,749 --> 01:01:53,334
I'll make them pay.

851
01:01:53,418 --> 01:01:55,253
That man was a detective!

852
01:01:55,336 --> 01:01:56,587
Do I seem that mindless to you?

853
01:01:56,671 --> 01:01:57,964
That bastard has some nerve.

854
01:01:58,047 --> 01:01:59,507
Ryu Si-o, I'm coming for you.

855
01:02:01,634 --> 01:02:06,639
