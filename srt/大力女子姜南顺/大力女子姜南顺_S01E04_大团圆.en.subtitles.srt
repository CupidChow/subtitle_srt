1
00:00:42,667 --> 00:00:45,962
STRONG GIRL NAM-SOON

2
00:00:49,924 --> 00:00:50,967
Nam-soon?

3
00:00:52,969 --> 00:00:54,012
Mom?

4
00:00:57,807 --> 00:00:58,808
Come here.

5
00:00:59,642 --> 00:01:00,852
Come on.

6
00:01:21,539 --> 00:01:22,832
Nam-soon!

7
00:01:44,354 --> 00:01:45,313
Nam-soon.

8
00:01:48,024 --> 00:01:48,942
Nam-soon?

9
00:02:02,288 --> 00:02:03,248
Mom.

10
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:06,543
Nam-soon.

11
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:08,169
Mom…

12
00:02:42,537 --> 00:02:43,621
I'll do it.

13
00:02:45,957 --> 00:02:47,041
To me,

14
00:02:47,792 --> 00:02:48,835
you're still…

15
00:02:50,628 --> 00:02:52,213
only six years old.

16
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:55,717
Mom.

17
00:02:57,552 --> 00:02:58,553
Yes.

18
00:03:00,722 --> 00:03:02,682
I'm your mom.

19
00:03:05,101 --> 00:03:06,603
Do you remember me?

20
00:03:09,355 --> 00:03:11,107
I don't remember,

21
00:03:12,317 --> 00:03:13,526
but I can feel it.

22
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:16,279
I can tell you're my mom.

23
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:24,787
Don't cry.

24
00:03:27,248 --> 00:03:30,335
I grew up perfectly fine and healthy.

25
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:33,963
The last memory I have of you
was when you were five,

26
00:03:36,382 --> 00:03:37,342
so to me,

27
00:03:38,009 --> 00:03:39,594
you'll start off by being six.

28
00:03:41,387 --> 00:03:43,389
Aren't I too big
to be considered that age?

29
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:46,476
I have all my teeth and my feet are huge.

30
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:50,438
How is your Korean this good?

31
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:52,273
I studied it.

32
00:03:52,857 --> 00:03:56,319
My mom and dad in Mongolia
even paid for classes.

33
00:03:56,402 --> 00:03:57,946
I couldn't be more grateful

34
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:00,281
to those who raised you.

35
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:02,659
Let's bring them here immediately.

36
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:03,701
No.

37
00:04:04,619 --> 00:04:06,871
Mom and Dad need to stay in Mongolia.

38
00:04:07,538 --> 00:04:10,291
They're busy around this time of year
shearing sheep.

39
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:11,209
No.

40
00:04:11,876 --> 00:04:14,504
I must return the favor.

41
00:04:16,214 --> 00:04:17,257
Then…

42
00:04:18,466 --> 00:04:22,095
can you build them a ger?

43
00:04:22,178 --> 00:04:23,012
A ger?

44
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:25,431
As in a tent?

45
00:04:29,227 --> 00:04:32,647
They can have one for leisure purposes.

46
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:34,816
I'll construct
a building for them as well.

47
00:04:34,899 --> 00:04:36,901
FOR LEASE

48
00:04:38,069 --> 00:04:39,570
They can run a rental property business.

49
00:04:40,071 --> 00:04:41,406
The money they earn

50
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:44,325
will provide a cushy life
after retirement.

51
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:45,285
"Rental property"?

52
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:47,453
I know what that is.
I saw it on a lot of K-dramas.

53
00:04:47,537 --> 00:04:49,580
From here on out,

54
00:04:49,664 --> 00:04:51,958
I will teach you
how Korean capitalism works.

55
00:04:53,876 --> 00:04:56,337
-"Capitalism"?
-Anyway,

56
00:04:57,338 --> 00:04:59,507
you remember your home address, don't you?

57
00:05:00,091 --> 00:05:01,384
Gers don't have addresses.

58
00:05:02,176 --> 00:05:04,637
You lived at a place
that doesn't even have an address?

59
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:06,931
-Yeah.
-A house without an address?

60
00:05:07,015 --> 00:05:08,683
Gang Bong-go, you damn bastard!

61
00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:12,979
"Gang Bong-go, you damn bastard"?

62
00:05:13,062 --> 00:05:14,981
No, don't pick that up.

63
00:05:15,064 --> 00:05:15,982
Don't listen to me swear.

64
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:20,361
What good would blocking my ears do
when I already heard it?

65
00:05:20,445 --> 00:05:21,404
It's all right.

66
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:22,655
I'm good at swearing anyway.

67
00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:24,240
I learned a lot from movies.

68
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:25,241
"Fuck off, asshole."

69
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:27,327
No, please don't say that.

70
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:29,996
The swearing I picked up
from your grandmother

71
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:32,040
has been etched on my insides.

72
00:05:32,665 --> 00:05:36,127
I don't want to pass that on as my legacy.

73
00:05:37,545 --> 00:05:39,505
Got it. I won't learn any new swear words.

74
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:40,631
Anyway,

75
00:05:41,549 --> 00:05:44,260
I will return the kindness
to all the people

76
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:47,805
who helped you these past 20 years,

77
00:05:48,431 --> 00:05:51,309
so write down all of their names for me.

78
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:56,189
Professor Choi's lectures

79
00:05:56,898 --> 00:05:59,233
are just the same as they were last year.

80
00:06:00,568 --> 00:06:01,861
No effort was put in at all.

81
00:06:02,403 --> 00:06:03,613
This is bad.

82
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:06,657
At this rate,
he could get fired after the evaluations.

83
00:06:06,741 --> 00:06:08,493
-I'm worried.
-Is it someone you know?

84
00:06:09,327 --> 00:06:10,453
Hardly.

85
00:06:12,497 --> 00:06:15,208
I snuck in after hearing
he was an expert on macroeconomics,

86
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:17,251
but it was a waste of time.

87
00:06:17,335 --> 00:06:19,921
With that kind of approach
to microeconomics,

88
00:06:20,004 --> 00:06:22,465
he'd never understand macroeconomics.

89
00:06:23,424 --> 00:06:24,300
You're right.

90
00:06:24,383 --> 00:06:28,054
You have far more experience
in a wide range of economic activities.

91
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:30,181
What would a professor know?

92
00:06:30,264 --> 00:06:31,265
That's the issue.

93
00:06:31,349 --> 00:06:33,851
What good does it do
to sit at a desk and study…

94
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:38,898
Are you hungry?

95
00:06:42,652 --> 00:06:44,695
I'm craving something spicy today.

96
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:48,616
Why don't we splurge on a meal today?

97
00:06:49,325 --> 00:06:51,410
The bibimbap served in the cafeteria here

98
00:06:51,494 --> 00:06:52,954
is topped with huge fertilized eggs.

99
00:06:53,037 --> 00:06:55,248
Let's just grab a meal in Haengdang-dong.

100
00:06:55,331 --> 00:06:58,751
You'll end up a vagrant
if you keep wasting money like that.

101
00:06:58,835 --> 00:07:00,753
There's no need to put it that way.

102
00:07:01,629 --> 00:07:04,132
-That's not what I meant.
-This is an announcement.

103
00:07:04,215 --> 00:07:07,468
Han River Metro Trump Square
Super-Duper Tower residents

104
00:07:07,552 --> 00:07:09,887
-Mr. Ji Hyun-soo and Ms. No,
-That's you.

105
00:07:09,971 --> 00:07:13,015
-please report to the campus back gate.
-Should we go?

106
00:07:13,516 --> 00:07:14,976
Allow me to repeat.

107
00:07:46,799 --> 00:07:49,802
I am Gang Nam-soon's mother.

108
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:53,764
-I see.
-Hello.

109
00:07:54,348 --> 00:07:57,643
Did we perhaps do something wrong?

110
00:08:04,233 --> 00:08:05,526
It's 200 million won each in cash.

111
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:10,406
I suggest you take care of
urgent business with it.

112
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:13,242
Buy yourselves some clothes

113
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:15,119
and eat proper meals.

114
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:17,497
You'll stay at the Geumju Hotel tonight.

115
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,415
It's a hotel I own,

116
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:20,541
so do not decline.

117
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:23,336
Mr. Choi will drive you there
in the evening.

118
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:30,426
We'll solve your problems one by one,
starting with a place to stay.

119
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:33,763
Please call me directly
should any issues pop up.

120
00:08:37,225 --> 00:08:40,061
The fact that you were
part of Nam-soon's journey…

121
00:08:42,063 --> 00:08:44,315
of coming back to me…

122
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:47,735
puts me in your debt.

123
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:52,782
Anyway,

124
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:54,867
please be in touch.

125
00:08:57,703 --> 00:08:59,330
This is insane.

126
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:00,957
Two hundred million won?

127
00:09:03,751 --> 00:09:04,961
It's real!

128
00:09:07,338 --> 00:09:09,090
I don't think
it's the day for bibimbap, babe.

129
00:09:09,173 --> 00:09:11,759
Today isn't the day
for something spicy either.

130
00:09:11,842 --> 00:09:13,135
First, hold onto the money.

131
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:15,179
Let's head for the subway lockers.

132
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:16,138
-Hurry!
-The lockers?

133
00:09:16,722 --> 00:09:19,016
No, just leave that.

134
00:09:23,479 --> 00:09:24,522
Goodness!

135
00:09:24,605 --> 00:09:27,900
You're here, my child!

136
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:29,944
My precious darling.

137
00:09:30,027 --> 00:09:32,738
Look at the fine lady you've become.

138
00:09:34,031 --> 00:09:36,284
You took after me and not your mom.

139
00:09:36,367 --> 00:09:38,452
Look how beautiful you are.

140
00:09:38,536 --> 00:09:40,329
You sweet little thing.

141
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:43,624
Nam-soon.

142
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:45,585
I heard you came across a fire today

143
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:47,545
and saved people at the scene.

144
00:09:47,628 --> 00:09:49,130
Your mom told me.

145
00:09:49,213 --> 00:09:51,048
Look at all the dirt on your face.

146
00:09:51,132 --> 00:09:54,010
Let's go and get you
cleaned up in the bathroom.

147
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:55,177
Wait.

148
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:58,472
Ms. Jung, can you buy
some new clothes for Nam-soon?

149
00:09:58,556 --> 00:10:00,600
-Yes, ma'am.
-Okay, let's go.

150
00:10:01,142 --> 00:10:02,768
I'll scrub your back for you.

151
00:10:02,852 --> 00:10:04,437
It reacts to water and dissolves.

152
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,813
After a certain period,

153
00:10:05,896 --> 00:10:08,107
the water evaporates
and leaves white powder behind.

154
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:09,984
This thing is dangerous.

155
00:10:10,484 --> 00:10:11,736
I'm sure this mask…

156
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,321
Just a second.

157
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:16,991
Hello?

158
00:10:17,074 --> 00:10:18,576
This is Hwang Geum-ju.

159
00:10:18,659 --> 00:10:19,785
Hello.

160
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:21,704
Did you meet up with Nam-soon?

161
00:10:21,787 --> 00:10:23,664
Yes, thanks to you.

162
00:10:24,498 --> 00:10:26,250
She's with me as we speak.

163
00:10:26,334 --> 00:10:28,961
I see. I'm glad to hear that.

164
00:10:30,588 --> 00:10:31,797
Thank you.

165
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:36,594
Ms. Gang's luggage is in my possession.

166
00:10:36,677 --> 00:10:39,805
I'll stop by your place
to pick it up myself.

167
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:41,474
Allow me to bring it over.

168
00:10:41,557 --> 00:10:42,850
No.

169
00:10:42,933 --> 00:10:44,435
It's only polite that I come.

170
00:10:46,228 --> 00:10:47,271
All right.

171
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:54,737
This isn't drugs. I bet it's just dust.

172
00:10:55,529 --> 00:10:58,282
Sir, no!
This is more potent than fentanyl.

173
00:10:58,366 --> 00:10:59,367
Rinse your mouth!

174
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:00,868
-Hurry!
-What's the matter?

175
00:11:03,245 --> 00:11:05,289
I think I already swallowed it.

176
00:11:05,373 --> 00:11:06,666
What are you, a child?

177
00:11:06,749 --> 00:11:08,542
How can the leader of a drug task force

178
00:11:08,626 --> 00:11:10,252
just try an unknown substance like that?

179
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:13,923
I just thought
it couldn't possibly be drugs.

180
00:11:14,423 --> 00:11:16,425
You weren't born yesterday.

181
00:11:24,725 --> 00:11:25,559
Nam…

182
00:11:28,562 --> 00:11:29,480
Nam-soon.

183
00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:39,240
Of course.

184
00:11:40,574 --> 00:11:41,784
No wonder…

185
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:44,703
It was you all along.

186
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:47,164
We met…

187
00:11:48,332 --> 00:11:49,458
at the photo studio.

188
00:11:53,087 --> 00:11:54,004
Dad?

189
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:56,799
Yes, I'm your dad.

190
00:11:58,092 --> 00:11:59,135
It's Dad, Nam-soon.

191
00:12:03,264 --> 00:12:04,598
Dad, I'm sorry.

192
00:12:05,182 --> 00:12:07,226
I let go of your hand, didn't I?

193
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:09,895
No, don't say that.

194
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:12,106
I'm the one who should apologize.

195
00:12:12,189 --> 00:12:14,024
I'm so sorry.

196
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:20,489
Nam-soon!

197
00:12:25,035 --> 00:12:26,328
This is Nam-in.

198
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:28,164
Your younger twin brother.

199
00:12:28,914 --> 00:12:30,166
I have a twin?

200
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:33,586
Underneath all that fat
is a boy who looks just like you.

201
00:12:38,466 --> 00:12:39,633
Nam-in.

202
00:12:41,385 --> 00:12:42,636
It's good to see you.

203
00:12:45,473 --> 00:12:46,724
Nam-soon.

204
00:12:46,807 --> 00:12:49,101
I missed you so much.

205
00:12:49,185 --> 00:12:52,104
I prayed for you every day.

206
00:12:52,188 --> 00:12:54,857
That must be why
we were able to meet again.

207
00:12:57,568 --> 00:12:59,236
It's weird, you know.

208
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,447
When I met Hwa-ja,

209
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:03,616
I could tell she wasn't my sister.

210
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:08,704
But I knew you were my sister
the second we met.

211
00:13:10,498 --> 00:13:11,457
Speaking of which,

212
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:14,293
where is she?

213
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:32,478
LEE MYUNG-HEE WANTED FOR FRAUD
REWARD UP TO 5 MILLION WON

214
00:13:36,607 --> 00:13:37,525
GANGHAN POLICE PRECINCT

215
00:13:37,608 --> 00:13:40,402
These are the transactions
linked to Baldy's crypto wallet.

216
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:42,196
All his transactions,

217
00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:44,740
the amount, and time are recorded.

218
00:13:44,823 --> 00:13:48,160
We must piece together
which wallet he traded with

219
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:49,870
and at what time, down to the second.

220
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,998
Let's work with the Cyber Bureau.

221
00:13:53,082 --> 00:13:54,208
I'll put in a request.

222
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:56,627
They turned us down
as they're busy with pornography cases.

223
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:59,046
The five of us can't possibly
go through all this data.

224
00:13:59,129 --> 00:14:00,005
Exactly.

225
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:01,549
We can't do all of this alone.

226
00:14:02,466 --> 00:14:03,884
As Homo sapiens,

227
00:14:04,593 --> 00:14:06,178
we should use our wits.

228
00:14:06,762 --> 00:14:08,430
I'm heading downstairs for a bit.

229
00:14:12,434 --> 00:14:13,477
What now?

230
00:14:14,228 --> 00:14:15,229
Chief.

231
00:14:15,771 --> 00:14:17,940
I'd like to propose an M&A.

232
00:14:18,023 --> 00:14:21,110
-What are you talking about?
-An M&A.

233
00:14:22,778 --> 00:14:24,321
-I look forward to our partnership.
-As do I.

234
00:14:26,156 --> 00:14:27,533
A round of applause!

235
00:14:28,117 --> 00:14:31,078
The precinct and the DIU
will help each other out

236
00:14:31,161 --> 00:14:33,080
-and cooperate as needed.
-One, two, three.

237
00:14:33,163 --> 00:14:33,998
It's a win-win!

238
00:14:48,971 --> 00:14:49,805
Mom.

239
00:15:05,654 --> 00:15:08,240
I felt so guilty
for failing to protect you

240
00:15:10,034 --> 00:15:12,286
despite having super strength.

241
00:15:12,369 --> 00:15:14,914
It's okay. I'm just as powerful.

242
00:15:15,623 --> 00:15:19,084
That's why I grew up
to be strong and healthy.

243
00:15:22,546 --> 00:15:23,547
Nam-soon.

244
00:15:25,549 --> 00:15:28,594
The women in our family
are born with super strength.

245
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:30,262
However,

246
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:33,015
that strength
should only be used for good.

247
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:36,393
If you use it for something bad,

248
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:38,312
you'll lose your power.

249
00:15:40,981 --> 00:15:43,233
The fact that you're still this strong…

250
00:15:44,526 --> 00:15:46,612
means you've led an honest life.

251
00:15:47,154 --> 00:15:51,200
I couldn't be more grateful for that.

252
00:15:51,283 --> 00:15:54,453
And that's how I'll continue to live.

253
00:15:54,536 --> 00:15:55,579
Of course you will.

254
00:15:56,705 --> 00:16:00,834
I'll always stay by your side
and help you stay that way.

255
00:16:04,838 --> 00:16:06,256
My sweet daughter.

256
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:10,135
It's late, so get some sleep.

257
00:16:10,719 --> 00:16:11,720
You too, Mom.

258
00:16:35,786 --> 00:16:36,787
Mom.

259
00:16:37,705 --> 00:16:38,872
It's me, Tsetseg.

260
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:41,959
How are you?

261
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:44,712
Mom,

262
00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:49,299
I found my birth parents

263
00:16:49,383 --> 00:16:52,594
and my younger twin brother here.

264
00:16:56,265 --> 00:16:57,433
How's Dad?

265
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,226
Can you put him on?

266
00:17:02,104 --> 00:17:03,105
Dad,

267
00:17:04,148 --> 00:17:05,315
don't worry about me.

268
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:06,942
I'm doing well.

269
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:09,820
Mom.

270
00:17:11,405 --> 00:17:12,281
Dad.

271
00:17:14,408 --> 00:17:17,202
I miss you both.

272
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:30,340
But I think there's something
I must do in Korea.

273
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:35,054
It seems there's a place
I could put my strength to good use.

274
00:17:39,141 --> 00:17:41,310
Got it, Dad.

275
00:18:05,459 --> 00:18:09,630
My son is too weak
and has trouble getting up.

276
00:18:09,713 --> 00:18:12,466
He spends his days
lying on the sofa or in bed.

277
00:18:13,217 --> 00:18:15,552
He's like a 40-year-old zombie
who smells like soap.

278
00:18:15,636 --> 00:18:16,804
Can you please help him?

279
00:18:16,887 --> 00:18:18,931
What are your symptoms?

280
00:18:19,014 --> 00:18:20,140
It's as if

281
00:18:20,808 --> 00:18:22,559
a strong gravitational force

282
00:18:22,643 --> 00:18:25,020
is constantly pulling me
toward the ground.

283
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:27,815
I can't seem to get on my feet.

284
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:29,858
When I do,

285
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:32,945
my body aches all over

286
00:18:33,028 --> 00:18:34,321
and I'm exhausted.

287
00:18:35,072 --> 00:18:37,825
It's why I always lie down.

288
00:18:40,244 --> 00:18:41,161
Let me examine you.

289
00:18:47,835 --> 00:18:49,086
He lacks energy.

290
00:18:49,169 --> 00:18:51,588
He's off-balance,
which explains the weak energy flow.

291
00:18:52,214 --> 00:18:53,799
That and his arrhythmia

292
00:18:53,882 --> 00:18:55,884
is why his vitals are weak.

293
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:58,595
I'll pay as much as you need,

294
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:02,724
so please just help my son
walk on his own two feet.

295
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:05,018
Velvet antler, bear bile, chaff flower,
virginsbower, gold-and-silver honeysuckle.

296
00:19:05,102 --> 00:19:08,147
Add everything good for him,
including organic goji berries.

297
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:10,440
Get him whatever Qin Shi Huang ate.

298
00:19:10,524 --> 00:19:14,403
No, I don't want a life
like Qin Shi Huang's.

299
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:16,947
He had an exhausting life.

300
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:19,116
It's already too late for you.

301
00:19:19,199 --> 00:19:22,035
Even if you start building today
and continue until you die,

302
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:24,538
you won't be able to build
a fraction of the Great Wall of China.

303
00:19:25,122 --> 00:19:27,833
In any case,
just add everything good for the body.

304
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:30,210
Blindly adding in ingredients
isn't the solution.

305
00:19:30,794 --> 00:19:33,338
I'll brew a tonic
that is just right for him.

306
00:19:38,135 --> 00:19:39,928
How about you, ma'am?

307
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:41,722
Shall I take a look?

308
00:19:43,932 --> 00:19:44,975
Well…

309
00:19:48,312 --> 00:19:49,438
Your pulse…

310
00:19:51,315 --> 00:19:53,442
I've never felt a pulse
quite like this before.

311
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,695
It runs in the family.

312
00:19:56,778 --> 00:19:58,780
The women are strong, but the men are…

313
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:03,452
Are you married?

314
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:05,370
-No.
-No?

315
00:20:12,085 --> 00:20:14,880
I have a class to teach
at the association today,

316
00:20:14,963 --> 00:20:16,298
so take a taxi home.

317
00:20:18,008 --> 00:20:21,428
Mom, I'm completely exhausted.

318
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:25,474
Here.

319
00:20:33,815 --> 00:20:34,983
Taxi!

320
00:20:36,109 --> 00:20:37,569
-Taxi…
-A grown man…

321
00:20:37,653 --> 00:20:39,738
I can't believe his mom is carrying him
in this hot weather.

322
00:20:39,821 --> 00:20:40,781
What are you looking at?

323
00:20:40,864 --> 00:20:43,659
He's not a spoiled brat,
and I'm no pushover.

324
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:46,245
He's too weak,
and this isn't a big deal for me.

325
00:20:46,328 --> 00:20:47,579
Taxi, get over here!

326
00:20:48,497 --> 00:20:51,166
Mom, please don't yell.

327
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:53,669
My ears hurt. You're killing me.

328
00:20:53,752 --> 00:20:55,087
Really?

329
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:56,838
Your ears aren't well either?

330
00:20:56,922 --> 00:20:59,258
They aren't. I'm exhausted.

331
00:21:00,342 --> 00:21:01,677
Get over here!

332
00:21:18,485 --> 00:21:19,861
Today's a special day.

333
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:21,363
My granddaughter has returned.

334
00:21:21,446 --> 00:21:22,364
-Congratulations!
-Congratulations!

335
00:21:22,447 --> 00:21:23,282
Thanks.

336
00:21:23,365 --> 00:21:24,408
So today,

337
00:21:24,491 --> 00:21:27,494
I will butcher a whole cow
for you to watch.

338
00:21:27,577 --> 00:21:28,453
-Thank you!
-Thank you!

339
00:21:28,537 --> 00:21:30,372
At ease, people.

340
00:21:31,164 --> 00:21:33,292
We're not like chefs.

341
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:36,295
Butchers don't try to establish
a hierarchy over each other.

342
00:21:36,378 --> 00:21:37,671
Do you know why?

343
00:21:37,754 --> 00:21:39,506
Because doing so

344
00:21:39,589 --> 00:21:42,676
could lead to murder
if one loses their temper.

345
00:21:42,759 --> 00:21:43,885
Knives…

346
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:51,977
can disjoin, dissect, and dismember
all organisms on this earth.

347
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:54,104
All right.

348
00:21:56,732 --> 00:21:58,608
Blood, flesh, and bone.

349
00:21:58,692 --> 00:22:02,404
Blood, flesh, and bone.

350
00:22:02,487 --> 00:22:04,448
Blood, flesh, and bone.

351
00:22:10,203 --> 00:22:12,539
Breaking up bones with a machine

352
00:22:12,622 --> 00:22:14,499
just isn't the same as doing it…

353
00:22:15,083 --> 00:22:16,043
with your hands.

354
00:22:16,126 --> 00:22:19,504
A soup made with bones
broken up with your hands

355
00:22:19,588 --> 00:22:21,214
tastes ten times more refreshing.

356
00:22:21,298 --> 00:22:25,385
That's how my daughter, Hwang Geum-ju,
became a billionaire.

357
00:22:25,469 --> 00:22:28,138
Her wealth comes from the success
of her seonji soup restaurant.

358
00:22:28,221 --> 00:22:29,181
Right?

359
00:22:46,448 --> 00:22:48,241
This gold magic wand

360
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:51,578
was my present for your fifth birthday.

361
00:22:54,081 --> 00:22:56,583
You wanted one of your own
after watching Cardcaptor Carrie,

362
00:22:57,084 --> 00:22:58,835
and your mom had it made for you.

363
00:23:00,295 --> 00:23:01,505
I see.

364
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:23,276
These are the dishes
you enjoyed the most when you were five.

365
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:25,987
Let's eat.

366
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:43,171
It's so good.

367
00:23:44,756 --> 00:23:45,757
Nam-soon.

368
00:23:46,758 --> 00:23:48,301
Does this jog your memory?

369
00:23:49,469 --> 00:23:52,222
-Yes.
-You loved cotton candy, remember?

370
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:56,184
You loved sausages as well.

371
00:23:57,519 --> 00:23:58,812
I remember

372
00:23:58,895 --> 00:24:01,731
how you even stole
my cotton candy from me.

373
00:24:01,815 --> 00:24:04,151
Did I do that? I'm sorry, Nam-in.

374
00:24:04,234 --> 00:24:05,735
No, it's fine.

375
00:24:06,319 --> 00:24:08,655
You still let me have all the meat

376
00:24:09,364 --> 00:24:10,782
since you didn't like it.

377
00:24:12,033 --> 00:24:14,870
I wonder why I can't remember anything.

378
00:24:16,163 --> 00:24:17,372
I feel bad about it.

379
00:24:17,455 --> 00:24:19,040
It runs in the family.

380
00:24:19,124 --> 00:24:21,626
You ladies are only built for strength,
not your brains.

381
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:24,171
That must be why you're not so bright.

382
00:24:24,254 --> 00:24:25,422
Shut it, Bong-go.

383
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:31,720
Today's a good day,
so I'll let that one slide, Mr. Gang.

384
00:24:32,929 --> 00:24:34,139
How about a family photo?

385
00:24:34,723 --> 00:24:37,100
I'd love to hang a large one up
proudly at the studio

386
00:24:37,184 --> 00:24:38,393
to show off my daughter.

387
00:24:38,476 --> 00:24:39,978
Grandma should be in it too.

388
00:24:40,061 --> 00:24:42,230
As well as your sickly uncle.

389
00:24:42,731 --> 00:24:44,858
-Though he's been in bed for three days.
-Then,

390
00:24:44,941 --> 00:24:46,651
let's take one by ourselves first.

391
00:24:46,735 --> 00:24:48,486
Here we go. Smile, everyone.

392
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:50,947
One, two, three.

393
00:24:51,907 --> 00:24:54,951
EPISODE 4
REUNION

394
00:24:57,287 --> 00:24:59,122
Elegantly.

395
00:24:59,998 --> 00:25:01,666
Like…

396
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:02,584
a swan.

397
00:25:02,667 --> 00:25:04,920
Wow, nice shot.

398
00:25:07,672 --> 00:25:10,133
My swings are on point
whenever I practice here.

399
00:25:10,675 --> 00:25:11,801
Don't you agree, Nam-gil?

400
00:25:11,885 --> 00:25:12,969
Of course, ma'am.

401
00:25:15,263 --> 00:25:16,264
Hello?

402
00:25:16,348 --> 00:25:17,766
Where's your boss?

403
00:25:18,516 --> 00:25:20,560
We're at the indoor driving range.

404
00:25:20,644 --> 00:25:21,519
Seriously?

405
00:25:22,103 --> 00:25:24,022
Is she practicing
how to hold back her strength?

406
00:25:24,105 --> 00:25:26,733
Yes, something like that.

407
00:25:27,317 --> 00:25:29,277
Today is bone soup day,

408
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:32,572
so have Managing Director Nam
at Geumju Hotel pick the bones up.

409
00:25:32,656 --> 00:25:33,698
Yes, ma'am.

410
00:25:52,133 --> 00:25:53,677
-Nam-gil.
-Yes?

411
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:56,513
Forward any calls
from Opulentia right away.

412
00:25:57,138 --> 00:26:00,433
I requested information
regarding drugs, you see.

413
00:26:00,517 --> 00:26:02,811
Drugs? What about them
are you curious about?

414
00:26:02,894 --> 00:26:05,480
Who the major distributor is in Korea.

415
00:26:06,648 --> 00:26:08,942
Opulentia had better not
take my money and blow me off.

416
00:26:09,025 --> 00:26:10,068
Goodness.

417
00:26:10,568 --> 00:26:12,362
They're not blowing you off, ma'am.

418
00:26:12,445 --> 00:26:14,281
Opulentia just sent you a reply.

419
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,116
Is that so?

420
00:26:16,908 --> 00:26:19,494
"There are drugs stashed at Doogo."

421
00:26:19,995 --> 00:26:21,037
Doogo?

422
00:26:25,792 --> 00:26:26,918
Doogo.

423
00:26:27,627 --> 00:26:30,130
Us new money should see each other around.

424
00:27:16,176 --> 00:27:17,594
It's been a while.

425
00:27:18,386 --> 00:27:21,222
Directors and investors,
it's good to see you.

426
00:27:25,727 --> 00:27:27,771
As you know,

427
00:27:28,355 --> 00:27:31,691
Doogo has strived to be the first
to actualize coin-based transactions

428
00:27:31,775 --> 00:27:33,443
by issuing Doogocoin.

429
00:27:33,526 --> 00:27:36,321
Its trading will soon begin officially.

430
00:27:44,454 --> 00:27:46,164
Just like our name "Doogo,"

431
00:27:46,247 --> 00:27:47,290
we do it ourselves.

432
00:27:47,999 --> 00:27:50,460
We do whatever our consumers want

433
00:27:50,543 --> 00:27:52,629
and go wherever
they want us to be. "Doogo."

434
00:27:55,298 --> 00:27:58,593
Per the memorandum of understanding
that Doogo signed

435
00:27:58,676 --> 00:28:00,929
to establish Asia's
largest logistics center next year,

436
00:28:01,012 --> 00:28:03,932
we will need at least 3,000 Doogo Men
in the second half of the year.

437
00:28:04,974 --> 00:28:07,018
Doogo will lead the industry

438
00:28:07,644 --> 00:28:10,105
in employment growth
by an overwhelming margin.

439
00:28:12,148 --> 00:28:14,067
Not only will we hire men,

440
00:28:16,111 --> 00:28:18,571
but we will also hire Doogo Women.

441
00:28:26,663 --> 00:28:27,914
Who says…

442
00:28:29,124 --> 00:28:30,208
that deliveries…

443
00:28:31,668 --> 00:28:33,461
must only be made by men?

444
00:28:44,222 --> 00:28:46,057
Make sure to cross-check
the time of purchase

445
00:28:46,141 --> 00:28:48,727
with the time of sale,
as well as the price.

446
00:28:49,436 --> 00:28:51,146
If you cut corners,
we'll be here all night.

447
00:28:51,229 --> 00:28:52,480
Jeez, my eyes.

448
00:28:58,653 --> 00:29:02,157
There was an assault at the protest
against the Hyeonu Party by the Han River.

449
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,618
Why are you two getting up?

450
00:29:05,702 --> 00:29:07,829
We agreed on a partnership, remember?

451
00:29:07,912 --> 00:29:09,038
-We should help.
-What he said.

452
00:29:32,187 --> 00:29:33,480
Ms. Hwang,

453
00:29:33,563 --> 00:29:36,483
should we publish an article
on how you found your real daughter?

454
00:29:36,566 --> 00:29:37,442
No, don't.

455
00:29:38,318 --> 00:29:41,571
Things almost went crazy
with stories about her and the fire.

456
00:29:41,654 --> 00:29:45,283
I made them take down everything
on social media and online newspapers.

457
00:29:45,366 --> 00:29:47,952
I was actually sent photos
taken at the scene.

458
00:29:48,036 --> 00:29:49,913
She leaped to the fourth floor
to save the kids.

459
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:54,709
I don't want to stress her out
with anything right now.

460
00:29:55,335 --> 00:29:58,880
All the articles so far were to
let the world know I was looking for her.

461
00:29:58,963 --> 00:30:02,008
Now, I must shield her from the spotlight.

462
00:30:02,091 --> 00:30:03,551
Stop all articles from being published.

463
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:05,970
-Yes, ma'am.
-Mr. Kim.

464
00:30:06,721 --> 00:30:08,473
It's time to move on to a new story.

465
00:30:09,057 --> 00:30:11,851
Recently, Ms. Park died
after taking drugs.

466
00:30:15,188 --> 00:30:17,232
Drugs are no longer
somebody else's business.

467
00:30:17,732 --> 00:30:19,317
It's become ours.

468
00:30:20,026 --> 00:30:22,612
Do a deep dive
into the drug use in Gangnam

469
00:30:23,446 --> 00:30:25,031
and report on its severity.

470
00:30:39,254 --> 00:30:41,881
Your face is on wanted posters
all over the city.

471
00:30:42,549 --> 00:30:45,426
-How do you expect to survive now?
-I need to earn money.

472
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:46,970
Get me a fake ID.

473
00:30:47,053 --> 00:30:48,304
That'll be 400,000 won.

474
00:30:51,349 --> 00:30:52,350
Here's a million.

475
00:30:52,433 --> 00:30:55,520
I got 150 million won
just by selling two of her watches.

476
00:30:55,603 --> 00:30:57,564
Between the prize money I won

477
00:30:57,647 --> 00:31:00,400
and selling the clothes and bags
I got from the family…

478
00:31:00,483 --> 00:31:01,818
Well, I'm loaded.

479
00:31:01,901 --> 00:31:03,111
There won't be any left

480
00:31:03,194 --> 00:31:05,780
after paying the boys
and picking up their medical bills.

481
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:07,866
All the more reason for me to earn money.

482
00:31:08,575 --> 00:31:09,701
A job will keep me hidden.

483
00:31:10,952 --> 00:31:13,371
It's not like I can lay low forever.

484
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:19,419
Name, An Eun-ji.

485
00:31:19,502 --> 00:31:21,421
She died three years ago.

486
00:31:22,005 --> 00:31:23,464
It won't be a problem

487
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:25,174
since no one's looking for her.

488
00:31:27,176 --> 00:31:28,344
Even if I died…

489
00:31:31,222 --> 00:31:32,891
I doubt anyone would look for me.

490
00:31:47,697 --> 00:31:48,698
DOOGO HIRING FEMALE DELIVERY STAFF

491
00:31:48,781 --> 00:31:51,159
Why are they looking
to hire female delivery staff?

492
00:31:52,243 --> 00:31:54,203
It's imperative for the firm's reputation.

493
00:31:54,287 --> 00:31:56,789
It'll help Doogo look more global
and at its prime.

494
00:31:56,873 --> 00:31:57,832
Of course.

495
00:31:58,458 --> 00:31:59,876
There's one other reason.

496
00:32:02,462 --> 00:32:05,423
Even among women,
there can be someone strong.

497
00:32:08,551 --> 00:32:10,094
I saw her myself.

498
00:32:11,888 --> 00:32:14,307
A woman who was unbelievably strong.

499
00:32:17,852 --> 00:32:20,521
I want to confirm
if what I saw actually happened.

500
00:32:23,024 --> 00:32:24,901
METHAMPHETAMINE
1 KG

501
00:32:34,118 --> 00:32:36,204
He inadvertently became
a human test subject.

502
00:32:37,538 --> 00:32:38,915
But he rinsed his mouth right away.

503
00:32:39,707 --> 00:32:40,792
How is this possible?

504
00:32:41,459 --> 00:32:43,294
What do we do about him?

505
00:32:45,004 --> 00:32:46,464
I have a bad feeling about this.

506
00:32:50,134 --> 00:32:52,220
-Hello?
-Gan I-sik, it's me.

507
00:32:52,804 --> 00:32:54,681
Hey. I heard you met your mom.

508
00:32:55,348 --> 00:32:56,349
I'm happy for you.

509
00:32:56,432 --> 00:32:59,102
Remember the photo studio you sent me to

510
00:32:59,185 --> 00:33:00,728
for my passport photo?

511
00:33:00,812 --> 00:33:02,814
-The photographer's my dad.
-Really?

512
00:33:03,815 --> 00:33:06,150
Who knew such a fateful encounter
could actually happen?

513
00:33:06,234 --> 00:33:09,195
Thanks to you, I found my mom and dad.

514
00:33:09,862 --> 00:33:11,239
Thanks, Gan I-sik.

515
00:33:11,739 --> 00:33:14,158
How long are you going
to keep calling me that?

516
00:33:14,242 --> 00:33:15,118
Words have power.

517
00:33:15,201 --> 00:33:17,704
I might actually
end up with a liver transplant.

518
00:33:17,787 --> 00:33:19,288
That will never happen

519
00:33:19,372 --> 00:33:20,915
because I'll protect you.

520
00:33:22,709 --> 00:33:25,211
Hee-sik, do you want to go out for a meal?

521
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:28,548
Okay.

522
00:33:29,215 --> 00:33:30,591
Let's go for a meal.

523
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:32,760
Think about what you want to have.

524
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:34,345
I'll be in touch.

525
00:33:34,971 --> 00:33:36,055
All right.

526
00:33:42,103 --> 00:33:43,813
What's with you?

527
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:46,399
Why's your heart pounding over this?

528
00:33:46,482 --> 00:33:47,567
Kang Hee-sik!

529
00:33:57,493 --> 00:34:00,371
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

530
00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:05,334
It's good.

531
00:34:05,418 --> 00:34:07,045
Thank you so much, Nam-soon.

532
00:34:07,128 --> 00:34:09,505
-It's nothing.
-My life has taught me

533
00:34:09,589 --> 00:34:10,798
that you never know…

534
00:34:12,008 --> 00:34:13,509
what the future may bring.

535
00:34:13,593 --> 00:34:14,927
It's what makes it fun.

536
00:34:15,011 --> 00:34:16,220
If we hadn't

537
00:34:16,304 --> 00:34:18,431
barged into Nam-soon's ger that day,

538
00:34:19,432 --> 00:34:21,350
this miracle wouldn't have happened.

539
00:34:22,769 --> 00:34:24,395
Gosh, I'm tearing up.

540
00:34:24,479 --> 00:34:26,189
I've always been curious.

541
00:34:26,272 --> 00:34:28,274
How did you two become vagrants?

542
00:34:29,692 --> 00:34:32,695
Let's save that story for some other time.

543
00:34:33,988 --> 00:34:34,989
Okay.

544
00:34:35,782 --> 00:34:37,617
What will you do
with the money my mom gave you?

545
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:39,285
I lost everything through cryptocurrency

546
00:34:40,912 --> 00:34:42,997
but it's what will get me back on my feet.

547
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:43,915
Cryptocurrency?

548
00:34:45,333 --> 00:34:47,168
Is that how you lost all your money?

549
00:34:47,251 --> 00:34:50,505
Nam-soon, let's do that job.

550
00:34:50,588 --> 00:34:53,091
The assistant director
called me in person.

551
00:34:53,174 --> 00:34:55,009
Do you have to work when you have money?

552
00:34:55,093 --> 00:34:57,470
What motivates people isn't money

553
00:34:58,054 --> 00:34:59,430
but dreams.

554
00:35:00,723 --> 00:35:01,557
Let's go.

555
00:35:02,767 --> 00:35:03,684
Off we go.

556
00:35:03,768 --> 00:35:06,479
Have fun then.
I'm going to have a spa day at the hotel.

557
00:35:07,355 --> 00:35:08,231
Okay.

558
00:35:10,149 --> 00:35:11,692
What role did he offer you?

559
00:35:15,613 --> 00:35:16,572
Sol.

560
00:35:18,908 --> 00:35:20,243
Isn't this a period drama?

561
00:35:20,326 --> 00:35:21,953
Why does Tarzan appear?

562
00:35:22,036 --> 00:35:23,246
Is Tarzan from Joseon?

563
00:35:23,329 --> 00:35:24,372
It has a modern twist.

564
00:35:24,455 --> 00:35:28,000
Hong Gil-dong of Joseon
travels back in time

565
00:35:28,084 --> 00:35:29,377
and lives as Tarzan.

566
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:30,962
The story sucks.

567
00:35:31,045 --> 00:35:33,172
They say you can't judge a show
until it airs,

568
00:35:33,256 --> 00:35:34,715
but this one is crystal clear.

569
00:35:34,799 --> 00:35:35,883
It'll flop.

570
00:35:36,384 --> 00:35:38,678
I can't believe writers get paid for this.

571
00:35:39,846 --> 00:35:41,806
I told you, no audio!

572
00:35:41,889 --> 00:35:43,432
You're a body double. Be quiet.

573
00:35:43,516 --> 00:35:44,600
Was that too loud?

574
00:35:45,101 --> 00:35:46,102
Hello?

575
00:35:48,771 --> 00:35:51,357
Why is that beanpole going overboard?

576
00:35:51,858 --> 00:35:54,735
Why is the body double
trying to do the audio?

577
00:35:54,819 --> 00:35:58,239
I said he was too skinny
and we needed someone different.

578
00:35:58,322 --> 00:35:59,824
Do we look the same size to you?

579
00:35:59,907 --> 00:36:00,867
Hey.

580
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:03,452
He's doing a much better job than you.

581
00:36:03,536 --> 00:36:04,912
Don't you agree?

582
00:36:04,996 --> 00:36:06,539
What are you yapping about?

583
00:36:06,622 --> 00:36:08,332
-I can do way better.
-Show us.

584
00:36:09,417 --> 00:36:10,334
Go ahead.

585
00:36:15,047 --> 00:36:15,882
See?

586
00:36:17,508 --> 00:36:18,551
You're terrible.

587
00:36:19,719 --> 00:36:22,638
Isn't he way better at it?

588
00:36:23,139 --> 00:36:26,601
Think about it. He's even better looking.

589
00:36:27,101 --> 00:36:28,519
Have him be the lead.

590
00:36:29,228 --> 00:36:30,688
Hey, what's your Myers-Briggs?

591
00:36:30,771 --> 00:36:31,939
Don't. She'll kill you.

592
00:36:32,023 --> 00:36:34,358
Han River Vagrant, you're the best!

593
00:36:39,405 --> 00:36:42,283
Hey, why don't you head over there and…

594
00:36:43,826 --> 00:36:45,077
…practice that some more.

595
00:36:45,161 --> 00:36:46,162
You just wait and see.

596
00:36:50,541 --> 00:36:51,459
Come on.

597
00:36:51,542 --> 00:36:53,920
Is this how you waste production costs?

598
00:36:54,670 --> 00:36:57,548
The male lead is uglier and a worse actor

599
00:36:57,632 --> 00:37:00,259
than the extra who only gets paid
100,000 won a day,

600
00:37:00,343 --> 00:37:02,470
but he gets 200 million won per episode.

601
00:37:03,721 --> 00:37:06,432
Is this how capitalism works in Korea?

602
00:37:12,063 --> 00:37:14,357
Tighten your core

603
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:15,691
and give it your all.

604
00:37:35,753 --> 00:37:39,006
MS. OH

605
00:37:39,924 --> 00:37:40,925
Hello?

606
00:37:41,968 --> 00:37:43,177
Hey, Mom.

607
00:37:43,803 --> 00:37:44,762
Today?

608
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:14,333
Is she already here?

609
00:38:25,428 --> 00:38:28,264
Hello, I'm Hwang Geum-ju,

610
00:38:28,347 --> 00:38:29,640
Nam-soon's mom.

611
00:38:30,349 --> 00:38:31,684
Hello. Come on in.

612
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:33,853
Then…

613
00:38:43,487 --> 00:38:45,072
This is all of Ms. Gang's luggage.

614
00:38:45,823 --> 00:38:47,783
Right. Thank you.

615
00:38:48,367 --> 00:38:49,410
Inspector Kang.

616
00:38:50,119 --> 00:38:52,455
-Yes?
-I don't know

617
00:38:53,039 --> 00:38:55,333
how I can express my gratitude.

618
00:38:57,585 --> 00:38:59,170
Tell me what you want.

619
00:39:00,838 --> 00:39:01,881
What I want?

620
00:39:02,757 --> 00:39:05,593
Everyone has a shortage of something.

621
00:39:06,969 --> 00:39:09,013
Tell me what it is you need.

622
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:10,973
I'll fill that void.

623
00:39:12,975 --> 00:39:14,560
-There's nothing.
-As if.

624
00:39:14,643 --> 00:39:16,312
It's not "as if."

625
00:39:16,395 --> 00:39:17,480
I really don't need anything.

626
00:39:17,563 --> 00:39:18,606
As if.

627
00:39:18,689 --> 00:39:19,982
Give it some thought.

628
00:39:20,941 --> 00:39:22,068
There must be something.

629
00:39:27,948 --> 00:39:29,700
I'm investigating a drug case.

630
00:39:30,368 --> 00:39:32,078
I'd like to catch
the mastermind behind it.

631
00:39:32,745 --> 00:39:33,746
How's that for an answer?

632
00:39:33,829 --> 00:39:36,165
You sure are an impressive detective.

633
00:39:37,208 --> 00:39:38,376
Hardly.

634
00:39:38,459 --> 00:39:40,127
Even after staying up two nights,

635
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:42,129
we still haven't caught a glimpse of them.

636
00:39:48,427 --> 00:39:49,970
Don't take this the wrong way.

637
00:39:50,054 --> 00:39:51,847
I know you don't need this,

638
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:55,309
but doing this will put me at ease.

639
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:56,519
Is this money?

640
00:39:57,228 --> 00:39:58,062
Yes.

641
00:39:58,145 --> 00:39:59,897
I do love money,

642
00:40:01,273 --> 00:40:03,818
but I can't accept what I don't deserve.

643
00:40:03,901 --> 00:40:06,445
I'm someone
who loves showing off my money.

644
00:40:06,529 --> 00:40:07,988
It motivates me to earn more.

645
00:40:08,656 --> 00:40:10,741
I even thought about giving all that I own

646
00:40:10,825 --> 00:40:12,993
to the one who brought my daughter home.

647
00:40:14,036 --> 00:40:17,123
It's why you absolutely deserve this.

648
00:40:18,791 --> 00:40:20,042
I'm afraid I can't take it.

649
00:40:21,585 --> 00:40:22,753
Please do.

650
00:40:23,254 --> 00:40:25,506
No, I can't take this money.

651
00:40:26,298 --> 00:40:27,842
Gosh, my feet hurt.

652
00:40:28,467 --> 00:40:29,468
Hee-sik…

653
00:40:52,908 --> 00:40:54,493
Is this why you became a cop?

654
00:40:54,577 --> 00:40:56,203
You decided to enter the force

655
00:40:56,287 --> 00:40:58,664
knowing that the job was tough
and didn't pay much.

656
00:40:59,665 --> 00:41:01,459
I don't care how desperate you are.

657
00:41:01,542 --> 00:41:03,669
You sought out a sugar mama around my age?

658
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:06,380
-You brat!
-A sugar mama?

659
00:41:06,464 --> 00:41:08,883
Mom, what are you saying?
It's not like that!

660
00:41:08,966 --> 00:41:10,676
Yeah, right!

661
00:41:12,219 --> 00:41:13,053
Let go.

662
00:41:14,346 --> 00:41:16,182
Let go!

663
00:41:20,436 --> 00:41:21,437
Ma'am.

664
00:41:22,354 --> 00:41:23,355
It's not what you think.

665
00:41:23,439 --> 00:41:25,191
A sugar mama?

666
00:41:25,733 --> 00:41:29,570
Is that what you think
of your remarkable son?

667
00:41:30,821 --> 00:41:33,866
Do I seem like someone
who'd be a sugar mama to a younger man?

668
00:41:33,949 --> 00:41:35,201
Then who are you?

669
00:41:35,284 --> 00:41:37,536
I'm sure we'll cross paths again.

670
00:41:38,412 --> 00:41:39,413
Until then…

671
00:41:41,749 --> 00:41:43,501
There will be a next time?

672
00:41:43,584 --> 00:41:44,585
My gosh.

673
00:41:49,173 --> 00:41:50,716
What on earth?

674
00:41:50,799 --> 00:41:52,676
-My gosh.
-Ma'am, you forgot…

675
00:41:55,054 --> 00:41:56,639
It's money, isn't it?

676
00:41:57,431 --> 00:41:58,474
A check?

677
00:42:00,059 --> 00:42:01,810
How many zeros are there?

678
00:42:03,312 --> 00:42:04,396
A nine-figure check?

679
00:42:13,656 --> 00:42:16,867
THERE ARE DRUGS AT DOOGO
100% CERTAIN

680
00:42:20,663 --> 00:42:22,248
I'm investigating a drug case.

681
00:42:23,123 --> 00:42:24,750
I'd like to catch
the mastermind behind it.

682
00:42:24,833 --> 00:42:28,295
Even after staying up two nights,
we still haven't caught a glimpse of them.

683
00:42:46,313 --> 00:42:49,024
There are drugs
at the logistics company Doogo,

684
00:42:49,108 --> 00:42:50,317
Inspector Kang.

685
00:42:55,573 --> 00:42:57,992
Mister, move over. I need some water.

686
00:42:59,076 --> 00:42:59,910
Hey, mister.

687
00:43:17,261 --> 00:43:18,971
This is Team 2 of Ganghan Police Precinct.

688
00:43:20,889 --> 00:43:22,516
This is Inspector Kang at DIU.

689
00:43:25,603 --> 00:43:26,729
He's dead?

690
00:43:28,063 --> 00:43:29,106
A mask?

691
00:43:39,366 --> 00:43:41,285
DOOGO MASKS

692
00:43:43,912 --> 00:43:44,955
Baldy's dead.

693
00:43:45,581 --> 00:43:46,707
Yes, I heard.

694
00:43:46,790 --> 00:43:48,375
That drug sure is potent.

695
00:43:48,459 --> 00:43:51,587
I only licked what was smaller
than a grain of salt,

696
00:43:51,670 --> 00:43:53,964
but I've been out of it all day.

697
00:43:55,758 --> 00:43:56,884
Sir,

698
00:43:57,426 --> 00:44:00,179
I think I have to go undercover.

699
00:44:00,262 --> 00:44:01,388
Where?

700
00:44:02,681 --> 00:44:06,477
DOOGO MASKS
ONLY AVAILABLE TO PREMIUM MEMBERS

701
00:44:31,919 --> 00:44:34,797
I don't like wearing
these kinds of clothes.

702
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:36,006
Please do it for Ms. Hwang…

703
00:44:36,548 --> 00:44:39,301
I mean, please do it for your mother.

704
00:44:39,385 --> 00:44:42,554
Imagine how much
she wanted to dress you up.

705
00:44:42,638 --> 00:44:45,891
A day didn't go by
without her thinking about you.

706
00:44:47,101 --> 00:44:48,102
Got it.

707
00:44:49,061 --> 00:44:50,270
Then I'll wear this.

708
00:45:06,745 --> 00:45:08,956
Ms. Yeon, get my daughter

709
00:45:09,039 --> 00:45:13,710
a pendant from Bulga**
and a bracelet from Tiffa**.

710
00:45:13,794 --> 00:45:15,129
Of course, Ms. Hwang.

711
00:45:16,797 --> 00:45:17,840
Darling,

712
00:45:18,507 --> 00:45:20,217
what kind of fun will you have today?

713
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:23,929
Wouldn't it be good to go to school?

714
00:45:24,888 --> 00:45:26,056
You should study.

715
00:45:26,765 --> 00:45:29,059
You'll be inheriting
everything I have in the end.

716
00:45:29,726 --> 00:45:32,563
To do so, you must study about the world.

717
00:45:33,439 --> 00:45:35,065
You must understand capitalism.

718
00:45:35,149 --> 00:45:37,276
Korean capitalism is no fun.

719
00:45:37,359 --> 00:45:38,777
It's because you don't know it well yet.

720
00:45:38,861 --> 00:45:40,946
Once you do, you'll find it really fun.

721
00:45:41,572 --> 00:45:43,490
I never liked studying.

722
00:45:44,324 --> 00:45:46,994
You truly are just like me.

723
00:45:47,536 --> 00:45:50,414
I never get why people
take pills for insomnia

724
00:45:50,497 --> 00:45:52,458
when all you need is to read a book.

725
00:45:55,252 --> 00:45:56,795
When I came here,

726
00:45:56,879 --> 00:46:00,591
I only thought about meeting you and Dad.

727
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:03,886
But now that I've met you,

728
00:46:05,095 --> 00:46:07,681
I don't know what I'm supposed to do.

729
00:46:07,764 --> 00:46:09,224
Of course you do.

730
00:46:09,308 --> 00:46:11,935
You can live happily ever after with me.

731
00:46:12,936 --> 00:46:16,482
And meet your father from time to time.

732
00:46:20,152 --> 00:46:22,946
What brings you the most joy?

733
00:46:27,326 --> 00:46:28,577
You know,

734
00:46:29,953 --> 00:46:33,373
I find the greatest joy
in helping other people.

735
00:46:35,501 --> 00:46:38,295
I want to be of help to someone.

736
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:41,298
That's how I am as well.

737
00:46:50,182 --> 00:46:51,141
Hey.

738
00:46:52,476 --> 00:46:54,686
Got it. I'll take a taxi.

739
00:46:55,312 --> 00:46:57,272
Right. Sure thing.

740
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:01,401
Who was that?

741
00:47:01,485 --> 00:47:02,694
Gan I-sik.

742
00:47:02,778 --> 00:47:03,987
He's this handsome guy.

743
00:47:04,613 --> 00:47:07,449
As in the detective
who brought us together?

744
00:47:07,533 --> 00:47:08,617
Yeah, him.

745
00:47:09,535 --> 00:47:10,619
Is it a date?

746
00:47:13,288 --> 00:47:14,498
A date?

747
00:47:16,792 --> 00:47:18,502
No, we're just having a meal.

748
00:47:18,585 --> 00:47:19,670
Then it's a date.

749
00:47:19,753 --> 00:47:21,129
No, it's not.

750
00:47:21,797 --> 00:47:23,423
We're just having a meal together.

751
00:47:25,551 --> 00:47:28,053
I'll head out for my meal with Hee-sik.

752
00:47:28,679 --> 00:47:29,846
All right.

753
00:47:31,181 --> 00:47:32,349
You're so pretty.

754
00:48:02,504 --> 00:48:05,257
You really look like
you're from Gangnam now.

755
00:48:07,301 --> 00:48:08,510
I mean you look pretty.

756
00:48:11,346 --> 00:48:13,390
Thanks. Let's order something good.

757
00:48:26,403 --> 00:48:28,572
Is this the taste of capitalism?

758
00:48:30,073 --> 00:48:32,618
Yes, and this is why people earn money.

759
00:48:33,243 --> 00:48:35,203
To buy tasty meals for their loved ones.

760
00:48:45,714 --> 00:48:48,133
By the way,
I won't be at the precinct for a while.

761
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:49,801
Why not?

762
00:48:50,802 --> 00:48:52,179
I'll be going undercover.

763
00:48:52,262 --> 00:48:53,305
What's that?

764
00:48:53,388 --> 00:48:54,222
In other words,

765
00:48:54,306 --> 00:48:56,850
I'll be getting a job somewhere
under a false identity.

766
00:48:56,933 --> 00:48:58,268
Where exactly?

767
00:48:58,935 --> 00:49:00,812
Somewhere that could have drugs.

768
00:49:01,897 --> 00:49:03,357
I received a tip,

769
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:05,275
and the follow-up proved it was solid.

770
00:49:05,942 --> 00:49:07,152
I want to check it out.

771
00:49:08,362 --> 00:49:09,738
I'll join you.

772
00:49:10,906 --> 00:49:13,367
Don't be ridiculous.

773
00:49:13,450 --> 00:49:14,660
It's too dangerous.

774
00:49:14,743 --> 00:49:15,786
I'll help you.

775
00:49:17,829 --> 00:49:19,247
I'm strong, remember?

776
00:49:22,459 --> 00:49:23,752
Use it to your advantage.

777
00:49:27,673 --> 00:49:28,924
Right.

778
00:49:29,007 --> 00:49:31,176
The company is hiring
female delivery staff too.

779
00:49:36,348 --> 00:49:37,432
Do you really want in?

780
00:49:38,809 --> 00:49:40,977
If you're doing it,
it must be for a good cause.

781
00:49:42,229 --> 00:49:44,439
Your name is Hee-sik.

782
00:49:44,523 --> 00:49:47,943
In Mongolian, it means "benevolent."

783
00:49:49,069 --> 00:49:51,571
I think hanging around you
will make me a better person

784
00:49:52,489 --> 00:49:54,366
and help people along the way.

785
00:50:10,841 --> 00:50:12,342
-Are you all right?
-I'm good.

786
00:50:22,352 --> 00:50:24,396
All right, thank you.

787
00:50:24,479 --> 00:50:25,897
Keep up the good work.

788
00:50:25,981 --> 00:50:27,357
Ms. An Eun-ji.

789
00:50:28,859 --> 00:50:29,735
Ms. An!

790
00:50:31,820 --> 00:50:32,696
Yes.

791
00:50:32,779 --> 00:50:35,157
Check the list of goods
that must be delivered today.

792
00:50:35,741 --> 00:50:37,492
You're liable should any go missing,

793
00:50:37,576 --> 00:50:39,119
so always confirm the amount.

794
00:50:39,202 --> 00:50:40,454
All right.

795
00:50:44,958 --> 00:50:45,959
Hello?

796
00:50:47,085 --> 00:50:48,670
Two new recruits?

797
00:50:54,384 --> 00:50:56,052
Mr. Kim Jun-seok.

798
00:50:56,136 --> 00:50:58,430
-That's right.
-And the young lady is…

799
00:50:59,765 --> 00:51:01,391
-Tsetseg?
-Yeah.

800
00:51:03,393 --> 00:51:04,436
Yes, sir.

801
00:51:05,771 --> 00:51:08,148
Mr. Kim, you've been
out of a job for three years.

802
00:51:10,484 --> 00:51:11,735
And the lady…

803
00:51:12,319 --> 00:51:13,653
is from Mongolia.

804
00:51:13,737 --> 00:51:16,239
I'm Korean, but I grew up in Mongolia.

805
00:51:16,907 --> 00:51:17,866
Sir.

806
00:51:18,366 --> 00:51:20,285
I have a work visa, so I can get a job.

807
00:51:21,203 --> 00:51:22,037
Sir.

808
00:51:24,456 --> 00:51:25,499
You can read, right?

809
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:27,375
Of course.

810
00:51:27,459 --> 00:51:29,586
Doogo, the hope
for the unemployed and immigrants.

811
00:51:29,669 --> 00:51:31,922
That's how people will see the company.

812
00:51:34,299 --> 00:51:35,300
All right.

813
00:51:35,842 --> 00:51:38,804
I'll bring you on this month as interns
and see how you do.

814
00:51:39,888 --> 00:51:41,264
Pull your weight or get packing.

815
00:51:41,348 --> 00:51:42,182
Sweet.

816
00:51:43,183 --> 00:51:44,142
Yes, sir.

817
00:51:44,643 --> 00:51:46,228
We'll do our best. Thank you, sir.

818
00:51:49,314 --> 00:51:51,775
Hey, I found it.

819
00:51:51,858 --> 00:51:52,818
You found it?

820
00:51:55,111 --> 00:51:56,613
It's Dericoin.

821
00:51:56,696 --> 00:51:59,366
Luckily for us,
Baldy wrote his password on his phone.

822
00:51:59,449 --> 00:52:01,535
I was able to trace the money he received,

823
00:52:01,618 --> 00:52:04,496
but the wallet it came from
was already empty.

824
00:52:04,579 --> 00:52:06,206
The owner must have cashed it in.

825
00:52:06,873 --> 00:52:08,500
Then there's no way to trace it.

826
00:52:08,583 --> 00:52:10,669
When will we have Baldy's autopsy report?

827
00:52:10,752 --> 00:52:11,962
Tomorrow, sir.

828
00:52:13,004 --> 00:52:15,173
Someone left him a mask.

829
00:52:15,257 --> 00:52:16,800
That's as good as a suicide pill.

830
00:52:16,883 --> 00:52:20,178
The mask wasn't anywhere,
including in the prison washroom.

831
00:52:21,054 --> 00:52:23,265
Why do you keep chugging down water?

832
00:52:24,057 --> 00:52:25,058
Beats me.

833
00:52:26,268 --> 00:52:27,686
I can't quench my thirst.

834
00:52:49,791 --> 00:52:51,167
The herbal tonic's too bitter.

835
00:52:51,251 --> 00:52:52,294
It's unbearable.

836
00:52:52,377 --> 00:52:53,712
Drink up for now.

837
00:52:56,214 --> 00:52:57,132
Wait.

838
00:52:57,215 --> 00:52:58,800
I should get some to Nam-in.

839
00:53:00,802 --> 00:53:01,845
It's hot.

840
00:53:34,586 --> 00:53:36,421
I don't think we've met.

841
00:53:36,504 --> 00:53:37,505
Right.

842
00:53:37,589 --> 00:53:40,550
I'm Seo Jun-hee, the new barista here.

843
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:42,761
May I take your order?

844
00:53:45,347 --> 00:53:47,390
I didn't come here for coffee.

845
00:53:47,974 --> 00:53:50,393
My grandson's the owner.

846
00:53:50,477 --> 00:53:52,312
Goodness. Really?

847
00:53:53,188 --> 00:53:54,481
It's a pleasure to meet you.

848
00:53:57,192 --> 00:54:00,528
How did Nam-in
manage to hire a gentleman this dandy?

849
00:54:03,990 --> 00:54:04,908
By the way,

850
00:54:05,909 --> 00:54:08,119
this is the bone soup I made this morning.

851
00:54:08,203 --> 00:54:10,038
Please have some when you're peckish.

852
00:54:10,121 --> 00:54:11,831
Gosh, I'm honored.

853
00:54:12,916 --> 00:54:13,917
Thank you.

854
00:54:15,085 --> 00:54:16,419
Would you like some coffee?

855
00:54:16,503 --> 00:54:19,756
I'd love that.
Let's chug a hot cup of Americano…

856
00:54:20,966 --> 00:54:22,425
Let's drink some coffee.

857
00:54:23,385 --> 00:54:24,552
You and me.

858
00:54:25,387 --> 00:54:26,429
Together.

859
00:54:30,934 --> 00:54:32,894
It's not like you have
other customers to serve.

860
00:54:37,482 --> 00:54:38,566
Shall we?

861
00:54:41,778 --> 00:54:43,446
The aroma of the coffee…

862
00:54:44,197 --> 00:54:45,407
The aftertaste…

863
00:54:49,703 --> 00:54:50,704
Thank you.

864
00:54:50,787 --> 00:54:52,330
How long have you been a barista?

865
00:54:53,206 --> 00:54:55,250
I worked at a securities firm
for 30 years.

866
00:54:55,917 --> 00:54:58,294
After retirement,
I studied coffee as a hobby

867
00:54:59,796 --> 00:55:01,548
and somehow ended up
entering competitions.

868
00:55:03,049 --> 00:55:04,175
Your missus…

869
00:55:06,011 --> 00:55:07,887
I mean, your wife must be delighted.

870
00:55:11,641 --> 00:55:13,309
She passed away

871
00:55:13,393 --> 00:55:15,437
five years ago.

872
00:55:17,897 --> 00:55:19,691
You poor thing.

873
00:55:22,610 --> 00:55:23,486
I'm also…

874
00:55:24,320 --> 00:55:25,447
without a partner.

875
00:55:29,576 --> 00:55:31,119
Did he pass away?

876
00:55:31,953 --> 00:55:32,954
No.

877
00:55:33,038 --> 00:55:34,289
He moved on.

878
00:55:35,623 --> 00:55:37,042
He ran off, you see.

879
00:55:38,418 --> 00:55:42,088
He left ten years ago
saying he wanted to find himself,

880
00:55:42,172 --> 00:55:43,506
but I haven't heard from him since.

881
00:55:45,258 --> 00:55:46,760
It's safe to assume he's dead.

882
00:55:48,887 --> 00:55:49,929
I see.

883
00:55:51,765 --> 00:55:52,599
The aroma…

884
00:55:54,601 --> 00:55:56,227
is exquisite.

885
00:56:04,861 --> 00:56:06,321
Slowly.

886
00:56:06,821 --> 00:56:09,074
Right there. Okay, good.

887
00:56:09,157 --> 00:56:10,575
Put them down.

888
00:56:10,658 --> 00:56:11,743
Good!

889
00:56:12,660 --> 00:56:15,038
All right. Today,

890
00:56:15,121 --> 00:56:17,791
you'll begin your work
by transferring these to the truck.

891
00:56:19,751 --> 00:56:22,212
You'll be partnering up like cops.

892
00:56:22,837 --> 00:56:24,172
I feel bad for you

893
00:56:24,881 --> 00:56:26,841
since you'll be doing
most of the work yourself.

894
00:56:27,926 --> 00:56:28,802
Hey, you!

895
00:56:30,178 --> 00:56:31,262
Hey, mister!

896
00:56:34,849 --> 00:56:36,267
Were you talking to me?

897
00:56:36,351 --> 00:56:37,227
Yeah.

898
00:56:37,936 --> 00:56:39,854
It's nothing, sir. Please ignore that.

899
00:56:41,898 --> 00:56:43,358
Will we be done for the day

900
00:56:43,441 --> 00:56:44,776
once we deliver all of these?

901
00:56:44,859 --> 00:56:45,902
That's right,

902
00:56:46,528 --> 00:56:48,404
but why are you talking down to me?

903
00:56:48,488 --> 00:56:50,281
You talked down to me first.

904
00:56:50,365 --> 00:56:51,491
Why are you allowed and not me?

905
00:56:52,117 --> 00:56:53,993
What? Why you little…

906
00:56:54,077 --> 00:56:55,036
Hey!

907
00:57:00,208 --> 00:57:02,919
DOOGO SPRING WATER

908
00:57:05,088 --> 00:57:06,131
Hey, mister.

909
00:57:06,214 --> 00:57:08,258
Get me that red plastic slab.

910
00:57:08,758 --> 00:57:10,885
-We'll move the crates on it.
-Sure.

911
00:57:10,969 --> 00:57:12,095
Got it, ma'am.

912
00:57:23,022 --> 00:57:27,694
How on earth is she this strong?

913
00:57:29,863 --> 00:57:30,989
Get out of the way

914
00:57:31,072 --> 00:57:33,199
-or help with the load.
-What the…

915
00:57:50,758 --> 00:57:51,759
Let's wrap this up quickly

916
00:57:51,843 --> 00:57:54,137
and get inside the warehouse at night.

917
00:57:54,762 --> 00:57:56,347
You said you had drugs to find.

918
00:57:57,974 --> 00:57:59,017
By the way,

919
00:57:59,642 --> 00:58:01,769
should you let people know
how strong you are?

920
00:58:03,438 --> 00:58:04,647
What can I do?

921
00:58:05,148 --> 00:58:06,524
Besides, it's nothing to be ashamed of.

922
00:58:06,608 --> 00:58:08,109
It's not,

923
00:58:08,193 --> 00:58:11,070
but it'll be bothersome
if you attract too much attention.

924
00:58:11,696 --> 00:58:12,780
I don't care.

925
00:58:13,740 --> 00:58:16,075
Anyway, I'll handle all the heavy lifting

926
00:58:16,159 --> 00:58:18,870
and you handle the odds and ends.
Got it, Gan I-sik?

927
00:58:19,412 --> 00:58:20,997
-Got it.
-Okay.

928
00:58:21,539 --> 00:58:24,375
Where on earth did you
pick up on words like that?

929
00:58:24,459 --> 00:58:27,253
But are you going
to keep calling me Gan I-sik?

930
00:58:28,004 --> 00:58:31,591
In Korean movies,
I heard people call each other like this.

931
00:58:31,674 --> 00:58:33,301
"Hey, brother!"

932
00:58:34,135 --> 00:58:35,011
What?

933
00:58:35,094 --> 00:58:36,471
We have the same surname.

934
00:58:36,554 --> 00:58:38,264
Hey, brother!

935
00:58:49,275 --> 00:58:50,235
Listen up.

936
00:58:50,735 --> 00:58:53,696
Drive at this speed for two minutes
and then pull over.

937
00:58:53,780 --> 00:58:54,697
Why? What is it?

938
00:58:54,781 --> 00:58:55,615
Do it.

939
00:59:00,578 --> 00:59:01,621
Why? Who is she?

940
00:59:01,704 --> 00:59:03,164
The Airdnd scammer.

941
00:59:11,422 --> 00:59:12,423
What the hell?

942
00:59:14,717 --> 00:59:16,219
Give me back my money.

943
00:59:16,844 --> 00:59:18,638
-What money?
-Do you know her, babe?

944
00:59:18,721 --> 00:59:20,098
No, I don't…

945
00:59:21,933 --> 00:59:22,809
Oh, right.

946
00:59:22,892 --> 00:59:23,935
The Mongolian.

947
00:59:24,018 --> 00:59:25,770
That's right. I'm from Mongolia.

948
00:59:26,354 --> 00:59:27,355
Airdnd.

949
00:59:28,398 --> 00:59:30,441
You listed a house for sale as your place

950
00:59:30,525 --> 00:59:31,985
and took off with my money.

951
00:59:32,068 --> 00:59:34,362
You're the worst.

952
00:59:34,946 --> 00:59:36,781
How can you be out on the street

953
00:59:36,864 --> 00:59:38,324
after scamming tourists?

954
00:59:38,408 --> 00:59:40,118
Babe, she's completely crazy.

955
00:59:40,201 --> 00:59:42,245
-Let me talk to her. Wait for me there.
-Sure.

956
00:59:47,166 --> 00:59:48,293
Tell me about it.

957
00:59:48,376 --> 00:59:51,546
The investigation was pretty sloppy
since I only targeted tourists.

958
00:59:52,547 --> 00:59:54,549
My case was terminated.

959
00:59:54,632 --> 00:59:56,968
I suggest you study more about Korea.

960
00:59:57,051 --> 01:00:00,680
This isn't a country that locks people up
for stealing chump change.

961
01:00:00,763 --> 01:00:01,848
Chump change?

962
01:00:02,932 --> 01:00:06,436
What will tourists think of Korea
after running into people like you?

963
01:00:06,519 --> 01:00:08,938
They'll believe
it's a country full of scammers.

964
01:00:09,022 --> 01:00:10,565
I almost did myself.

965
01:00:10,648 --> 01:00:12,358
You were rude even from the get-go.

966
01:00:13,234 --> 01:00:16,779
The way you speak
really gets on my nerves.

967
01:00:18,865 --> 01:00:20,116
Nam-soon, wait.

968
01:00:21,117 --> 01:00:22,410
You can't hit her.

969
01:00:22,994 --> 01:00:24,871
I don't hit women.

970
01:00:29,292 --> 01:00:30,752
Give me back my money.

971
01:00:30,835 --> 01:00:33,338
Give back the money
you stole from others too.

972
01:00:33,963 --> 01:00:35,089
Then I'll forgive you.

973
01:00:37,550 --> 01:00:40,428
Hey, even a prosecutor let me go.

974
01:00:40,511 --> 01:00:43,014
So who are you to forgive me or not?

975
01:00:44,390 --> 01:00:46,768
It's up to you to get your money back.

976
01:00:48,394 --> 01:00:49,437
Is that so?

977
01:01:07,330 --> 01:01:09,832
I hate Korea's so-called capitalism.

978
01:01:09,916 --> 01:01:11,584
I hate its law as well.

979
01:01:11,668 --> 01:01:14,128
How can they let that scammer
see the light of day?

980
01:01:15,296 --> 01:01:17,382
Scammers are the worst.

981
01:01:18,966 --> 01:01:22,136
I'm going to change
how things work in this country.

982
01:01:26,140 --> 01:01:27,225
Start the car.

983
01:01:29,394 --> 01:01:30,687
Got it.

984
01:02:34,375 --> 01:02:36,502
SPECIAL THANKS TO JEON SOO-KYEONG

985
01:03:07,366 --> 01:03:09,994
STRONG GIRL NAM-SOON

986
01:03:10,077 --> 01:03:12,288
-You let her steal from you?
-I wanted to prevent that.

987
01:03:12,371 --> 01:03:13,915
Do you still have feelings for each other?

988
01:03:13,998 --> 01:03:14,874
-As if!
-As if!

989
01:03:14,957 --> 01:03:16,793
I checked with the manager in charge.

990
01:03:16,876 --> 01:03:19,128
-There's an extraordinarily strong girl.
-There you are.

991
01:03:19,212 --> 01:03:21,214
He launders money for the one percent.

992
01:03:21,297 --> 01:03:23,382
I'll cut right to the chase.

993
01:03:23,466 --> 01:03:25,259
I hear you're a master
at handling black money.

994
01:03:25,343 --> 01:03:26,260
I'm obsessed with it.

995
01:03:26,344 --> 01:03:28,513
I looked into Ryu Si-o.
Something's not right.

996
01:03:28,596 --> 01:03:30,264
Tell him to abort the operation.

997
01:03:30,348 --> 01:03:32,099
You can't lead a normal life.

998
01:03:32,183 --> 01:03:33,559
Let's save the world.

999
01:03:33,643 --> 01:03:35,520
I'll look into it alone today.

1000
01:03:35,603 --> 01:03:37,396
Gang Nam-soon is at Doogo.

1001
01:03:37,480 --> 01:03:39,982
I'm going to kill them all.

1002
01:03:41,734 --> 01:03:46,739
