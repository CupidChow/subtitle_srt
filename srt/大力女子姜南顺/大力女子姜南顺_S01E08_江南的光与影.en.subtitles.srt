STRONG GIRL NAM-SOON

00:00:48,423 --> 00:00:50,967
EPISODE 8
LIGHT AND SHADOW OF GANGNAM

3
00:01:11,696 --> 00:01:12,572
Hello?

4
00:01:12,655 --> 00:01:14,657
Hee-sik, I can't get through
their firewall.

5
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:17,619
I keep getting cut out.
They must have an anti-debugging program.

6
00:01:17,702 --> 00:01:19,204
The same goes for other source codes.

7
00:01:19,954 --> 00:01:21,998
It's like an impenetrable fortress.

8
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:23,458
Keep at it just a bit more.

9
00:01:24,125 --> 00:01:25,877
I'm headed to the team leader's place.

10
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:27,462
He's not answering his phone.

11
00:02:49,752 --> 00:02:50,962
Keep an eye out.

12
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:02,181
-Which club?
-What?

13
00:03:02,265 --> 00:03:03,516
Which club are you in?

14
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,184
What's the name of your motorcycle club?

15
00:03:05,268 --> 00:03:06,436
I'm not part of any clubs.

16
00:03:08,563 --> 00:03:09,856
No affiliations?

17
00:03:11,065 --> 00:03:13,276
You should be riding pillion
behind your husband.

18
00:03:13,943 --> 00:03:17,071
A woman shouldn't be
recklessly out and about like this.

19
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:19,532
I like how wild you are.

20
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:22,660
Join our club.

21
00:03:33,212 --> 00:03:35,173
I'll be especially nice to you

22
00:03:35,256 --> 00:03:36,716
since you're such a pretty lady.

23
00:03:40,136 --> 00:03:41,137
You're my type.

24
00:03:43,514 --> 00:03:45,141
Let's roll. She's bound to call.

25
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:46,768
-Hey.
-Yes?

26
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:48,895
You forgot this.

27
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:52,148
What a sweetheart.

28
00:04:08,665 --> 00:04:10,041
If I join your club,

29
00:04:10,124 --> 00:04:12,585
will I get to ride with a hunk behind me

30
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:14,796
and not a slob like yourself?

31
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:16,047
If so, I'll join.

32
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:18,675
You.

33
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:21,636
Make a sick pass like this at women again

34
00:04:22,387 --> 00:04:24,806
and you'll end up crushed
like your helmet.

35
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:27,308
-Got it?
-Yes, ma'am.

36
00:04:32,855 --> 00:04:33,982
You.

37
00:04:34,065 --> 00:04:37,360
Don't think I won't know what you're up to
just because I'm not around.

38
00:04:37,443 --> 00:04:38,903
Even if I'm in the middle of nowhere,

39
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:41,406
I'll know what you're up to.

40
00:04:41,489 --> 00:04:43,741
Clear the road of any helmet debris.

41
00:04:43,825 --> 00:04:45,535
If you so much as leave a piece behind,

42
00:04:45,618 --> 00:04:46,911
I'll lodge it in your throat

43
00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:48,746
so you'll feel it every meal.

44
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:50,748
We shouldn't pollute the Earth, right?

45
00:04:50,832 --> 00:04:53,209
-No, ma'am.
-This pretty lady will get going.

46
00:05:27,785 --> 00:05:29,787
Nice. I look way prettier.

47
00:05:30,288 --> 00:05:32,081
Good.

48
00:05:39,464 --> 00:05:40,340
Jun-hee.

49
00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:41,966
Let's get some hangover soup.

50
00:05:43,217 --> 00:05:45,261
You drank well into the night yesterday.

51
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:50,683
The hotel serves a special hangover soup.

52
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:09,994
Jun-hee.

53
00:06:17,418 --> 00:06:18,294
Hey.

54
00:06:18,377 --> 00:06:20,671
Why weren't you picking up your phone?

55
00:06:20,755 --> 00:06:23,091
Did you come running out of concern?

56
00:06:23,174 --> 00:06:24,008
Of course.

57
00:06:24,092 --> 00:06:26,219
Don't worry. I'm doing just fine.

58
00:06:27,762 --> 00:06:29,388
I also tried drinking some water.

59
00:06:29,472 --> 00:06:30,723
Since when?

60
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:32,934
A day after I left your place.

61
00:06:33,017 --> 00:06:34,685
Nothing happened after I drank some.

62
00:07:00,461 --> 00:07:01,379
Hello?

63
00:07:05,842 --> 00:07:06,884
Got it.

64
00:07:09,554 --> 00:07:11,097
We have another dead victim.

65
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:31,117
It's good, isn't it?

66
00:07:32,618 --> 00:07:35,163
I don't know if it's because
it's served in a hotel,

67
00:07:35,246 --> 00:07:37,498
but this hangover soup is divine.

68
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:39,542
It's due to the beef stock.

69
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:42,628
-The serving's generous too.
-Joong-gan.

70
00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:44,547
Your name may mean "in the middle,"

71
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:48,134
but there's nothing moderate about you,
my dear Joong-gan.

72
00:07:48,217 --> 00:07:49,719
"My dear Joong-gan."

73
00:07:49,802 --> 00:07:51,596
You're making my heart flutter.

74
00:07:51,679 --> 00:07:53,723
Now I never want to sober up
from this buzz.

75
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:58,478
So this hotel belongs to your daughter?

76
00:07:58,561 --> 00:08:01,856
Yes, the hangover soup restaurant
is hers as well.

77
00:08:01,939 --> 00:08:04,817
There's always a hangover soup restaurant
in all her buildings.

78
00:08:04,901 --> 00:08:07,862
It's her way of remembering our roots.

79
00:08:08,696 --> 00:08:10,531
But she's still fairly young.

80
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:14,952
Is your runaway husband a billionaire?

81
00:08:15,036 --> 00:08:17,121
Did she inherit everything from him?

82
00:08:17,205 --> 00:08:19,790
No, that man has zilch.

83
00:08:19,874 --> 00:08:22,210
All he had were his two balls.

84
00:08:24,295 --> 00:08:27,381
My daughter was never a bright student.

85
00:08:28,216 --> 00:08:31,469
In elementary school, it took her a year
to memorize the times table.

86
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:34,972
-Isn't it heartbreaking?
-I guess it is.

87
00:08:35,723 --> 00:08:37,016
Since then,

88
00:08:37,099 --> 00:08:39,268
I knew academics weren't in her future.

89
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:42,146
So I never pressed her to study.

90
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:44,941
I ran a butcher shop
in Majang-dong at the time,

91
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:46,526
so I brought her to work

92
00:08:46,609 --> 00:08:49,278
and had her manage the counter.

93
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:51,739
Forget about the times table.

94
00:08:51,822 --> 00:08:54,784
She could even multiply
double-digit numbers with ease.

95
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:57,161
That's when I knew
she had great financial intuition.

96
00:08:57,787 --> 00:08:59,497
Who knew that was possible?

97
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:02,250
When she turned 20,
I didn't get her enrolled in a college.

98
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:03,417
I gave her 100 million won,

99
00:09:03,501 --> 00:09:07,004
the sum of her college fund and her wage
from working part-time at my shop,

100
00:09:07,088 --> 00:09:09,882
as seed money to try whatever she wanted.

101
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:11,842
In three years, I'll multiply it tenfold.

102
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:15,680
And in five years,
I'll have it turned into five billion won.

103
00:09:15,763 --> 00:09:17,974
By evading taxes
and engaging in speculation?

104
00:09:18,766 --> 00:09:20,476
-Of course not.
-Then what?

105
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,769
What will you try first?

106
00:09:21,852 --> 00:09:25,648
Supply me all the beef bones and seonji
from your shop at cost price.

107
00:09:26,315 --> 00:09:29,569
With 30 million out of the 100, I'll open
a seonji hangover soup restaurant.

108
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:32,071
Another 30 million
will be spent on shares.

109
00:09:32,154 --> 00:09:33,864
And I'll buy forestland
with the remaining 40 million.

110
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,159
We're doomed.

111
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:39,954
The seonji hangover soup restaurant
was a total hit.

112
00:09:41,163 --> 00:09:42,290
I see.

113
00:09:42,373 --> 00:09:44,542
And the shares she bought
saw a tenfold increase

114
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:47,545
when the company was listed
on the stock exchange three years later.

115
00:09:47,628 --> 00:09:51,382
The real money maker was the land though.

116
00:09:51,465 --> 00:09:54,427
It was developed
into an apartment complex.

117
00:09:56,637 --> 00:10:01,058
It seemed as if the forces of the universe
were supporting my daughter.

118
00:10:02,643 --> 00:10:05,813
However, she didn't just sell
the land she owned.

119
00:10:05,896 --> 00:10:09,358
She joined in
on the apartment construction herself.

120
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:10,526
Bring it.

121
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:14,030
You little--

122
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:19,327
She single-handedly mastered
the world of construction,

123
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:22,038
-which was a men's domain then.
-Come on. Bring it.

124
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:23,789
Everything she touched turned into gold.

125
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:26,292
She essentially had the Midas touch.

126
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:30,171
At the age of 24,
her net worth was 10 billion won.

127
00:10:30,254 --> 00:10:31,464
That's a billion won as promised.

128
00:10:31,547 --> 00:10:32,381
Take it.

129
00:10:32,923 --> 00:10:34,258
Thanks for the loan, Ms. Gil.

130
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:38,638
Get back to me
with ten billion in five years.

131
00:10:38,721 --> 00:10:39,889
I'm reinvesting in you.

132
00:10:39,972 --> 00:10:42,224
Not as my daughter,
but as Hwang Geum-ju, the entrepreneur.

133
00:10:43,184 --> 00:10:44,101
Sure.

134
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:45,686
Ten billion won in five yearsâ€¦

135
00:10:46,187 --> 00:10:47,730
with extra.

136
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:49,440
-What are your terms?
-Listen.

137
00:10:49,523 --> 00:10:51,692
I'll close up my shop in five years.

138
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,194
In my latter years,

139
00:10:53,277 --> 00:10:55,946
that means until I die,

140
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:58,866
I'd like a monthly allowance
of 50 million won.

141
00:10:58,949 --> 00:11:01,202
Is that too hard for you?

142
00:11:01,285 --> 00:11:02,328
As if.

143
00:11:04,205 --> 00:11:05,790
Just like the saying,
"Money begets money,"

144
00:11:05,873 --> 00:11:08,250
every business she opened
was a huge success.

145
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:10,795
And you wouldn't believe
what also happened.

146
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:16,133
Geum-ju and Bong-go went to Kenya

147
00:11:16,217 --> 00:11:19,553
because Nam-soon
wanted to see elephants and lions.

148
00:11:19,637 --> 00:11:21,222
And out of the blue,

149
00:11:21,305 --> 00:11:25,393
she ran into a taxi driver who used to be
a regular at her seonji restaurant.

150
00:11:25,476 --> 00:11:30,815
He was there in Nairobi
working as a driver for a diplomat.

151
00:11:30,898 --> 00:11:33,859
A fire broke out
at the diplomat's residence,

152
00:11:33,943 --> 00:11:36,362
and so they had to move.

153
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:39,865
Geum-ju purchased the burnt residence

154
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:42,284
from the Korean government
at a cheap price

155
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:43,786
to build a summer house there.

156
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:44,912
And?

157
00:11:44,995 --> 00:11:46,664
What do you think happened?

158
00:11:46,747 --> 00:11:48,165
Come on, tell me.

159
00:11:48,249 --> 00:11:49,166
Wellâ€¦

160
00:11:50,167 --> 00:11:51,252
Just a second.

161
00:11:53,421 --> 00:11:54,338
Hello?

162
00:11:54,422 --> 00:11:57,383
My gosh. What happened next?

163
00:11:57,466 --> 00:12:00,428
What? I'm to accept
the Brave Citizen Award?

164
00:12:01,011 --> 00:12:01,846
Forget it.

165
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:04,306
I said forget it.

166
00:12:05,683 --> 00:12:07,935
It's our last day
eating breakfast at this hotel.

167
00:12:13,274 --> 00:12:14,775
This hangover soup is to die for.

168
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:16,444
Babe.

169
00:12:17,361 --> 00:12:18,446
Have some.

170
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:28,122
Did you find a place to stay?

171
00:12:28,205 --> 00:12:30,249
Yes, I'm moving in today.

172
00:12:31,792 --> 00:12:34,545
You're not who you used to be.

173
00:12:35,504 --> 00:12:37,673
-What do you mean?
-There's no warmth to you.

174
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:43,471
I don't know if it's because
you came into money or started acting,

175
00:12:43,971 --> 00:12:45,306
but you're different.

176
00:12:49,977 --> 00:12:50,811
Ms. No.

177
00:12:51,687 --> 00:12:54,356
It's time this relationship

178
00:12:55,149 --> 00:12:55,983
came to an end.

179
00:12:56,066 --> 00:12:58,152
How could your love for me change?

180
00:12:58,235 --> 00:13:00,821
One's affection
is the most inconstant thing in the world.

181
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:01,739
Is there someone else?

182
00:13:01,822 --> 00:13:03,824
No, I don't transfer
between relationships.

183
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:06,952
I hate transferring so much
that I'd rather take a bus

184
00:13:07,036 --> 00:13:08,871
-than change between subway lines.
-Thenâ€¦

185
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:12,708
why are you being like this
out of the blue?

186
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:13,959
There's no need

187
00:13:15,085 --> 00:13:17,338
for me to protect you anymore.

188
00:13:17,838 --> 00:13:21,467
I was drawn to you and we became an item

189
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:23,135
because we pitied each other.

190
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:26,263
But now, we don't need one another
to manage in this world.

191
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:31,018
I'd rather go back to the time
when we shared a triangle gimbap.

192
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:36,440
I never want to go back
to that time again.

193
00:13:40,819 --> 00:13:41,654
Yes, Director.

194
00:13:42,947 --> 00:13:46,325
Gangnam Police Station
wants to grant me the Brave Citizen Award.

195
00:13:46,408 --> 00:13:47,451
How annoying.

196
00:13:48,118 --> 00:13:50,162
So what happened next?

197
00:13:50,246 --> 00:13:53,207
What happened to your daughter
after she bought the diplomat's residence?

198
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:55,834
Oh please, be patient.

199
00:13:55,918 --> 00:13:57,253
Joong-gan, please.

200
00:13:58,170 --> 00:13:59,505
How about a commercial break?

201
00:13:59,588 --> 00:14:01,715
-How about a quick commercial break?
-Seriously?

202
00:14:32,913 --> 00:14:34,999
GEUMJU GROUP

203
00:14:42,131 --> 00:14:44,008
CEO HWANG GEUM-JU

204
00:14:44,091 --> 00:14:45,426
Hello, everyone.

205
00:14:45,509 --> 00:14:49,179
We will begin Geumju Group's conference
on major issues for the fourth quarter.

206
00:14:49,263 --> 00:14:52,224
Currently present are the CEOs
of Geumju Financial Holdings,

207
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:54,643
Geumju Construction, Geumju Daily,

208
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:57,438
Geumju Hotel, and Gold Blue.

209
00:14:57,521 --> 00:15:00,107
The heads of the legal team, PR team,

210
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:02,651
and the accounting team of Geumju Group
are also with us.

211
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:06,864
First, the head of accounting will give us
his evaluation of the fourth quarter.

212
00:15:07,448 --> 00:15:10,492
Here is the evaluation
of this year's fourth quarter.

213
00:15:20,377 --> 00:15:22,087
Take just one more.

214
00:15:22,171 --> 00:15:23,964
You'll notice the difference.

215
00:15:24,048 --> 00:15:25,466
QUICK WEIGHT LOSS
A LIFE-CHANGING SOLUTION

216
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:32,014
DONGHWA BANK: 5,000,000 WON

217
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:33,140
TRANSFER COMPLETE

218
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:41,482
Congratulations on joining
the corporate relations team.

219
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:47,071
But don't ever test me again.

220
00:15:47,154 --> 00:15:48,238
I didn't like it at all.

221
00:15:49,907 --> 00:15:50,866
All right.

222
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:53,911
I won't test you in any way again,

223
00:15:54,536 --> 00:15:55,454
so you can relax.

224
00:15:56,747 --> 00:15:57,623
But your strengthâ€¦

225
00:15:58,582 --> 00:16:00,668
Is there a story behind it?

226
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:03,671
Did you receive
special training in Mongolia

227
00:16:03,754 --> 00:16:05,506
or do you eat

228
00:16:06,215 --> 00:16:08,133
something out of the ordinary?

229
00:16:09,218 --> 00:16:10,719
You must not tell him

230
00:16:11,553 --> 00:16:16,225
that your strength is a trait
shared by the women of our family.

231
00:16:19,728 --> 00:16:21,271
I'll tell you all in good time.

232
00:16:23,148 --> 00:16:23,983
All right.

233
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:25,859
We'll take things slow.

234
00:16:26,527 --> 00:16:27,987
Anyway,

235
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:30,823
I should wrap things up
at the warehouse first.

236
00:16:30,906 --> 00:16:33,242
I'll go talk to Manager Heo and come back.

237
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:34,451
Have a good one.

238
00:16:57,349 --> 00:16:58,392
Hey, Nam-soon,

239
00:16:58,475 --> 00:17:00,602
why haven't you been in touch?
I was worried.

240
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:04,148
I passed Ryu Si-o's test
and will be working with him directly.

241
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:06,650
As a member
of the corporate relations team,

242
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:07,860
or something like that.

243
00:17:07,943 --> 00:17:08,777
Either way,

244
00:17:09,445 --> 00:17:11,196
we're getting closer to the truth.

245
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,991
A test? What kind of test?

246
00:17:14,074 --> 00:17:15,951
He tested my strength.

247
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:17,161
Your strength?

248
00:17:17,244 --> 00:17:18,871
Yes. Anyway,

249
00:17:18,954 --> 00:17:20,664
I passed with flying colors.

250
00:17:21,999 --> 00:17:23,625
Rather than being crushed myself,

251
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:25,377
I crushed the industrial press instead.

252
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:27,046
He tried to crush you
with an industrial press?

253
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:29,423
This guy is completely crazy!

254
00:17:30,966 --> 00:17:32,092
Hey.

255
00:17:32,176 --> 00:17:34,887
I'll do my job on this side of the line,

256
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:37,181
so focus on the investigation
on your end, okay?

257
00:17:40,642 --> 00:17:43,020
Gan I-sik, I'll call you again later.

258
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:45,314
Hello? Hey.

259
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:50,027
-Hello?
-Tsetseg.

260
00:17:50,652 --> 00:17:52,571
This is Manager Heo.

261
00:17:52,654 --> 00:17:54,490
Shouldn't you be at work?

262
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:56,366
I ate 100 raw eggs

263
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:58,744
just as you told me,

264
00:18:00,162 --> 00:18:02,456
and I've been blasting
out of both ends all night.

265
00:18:02,539 --> 00:18:03,791
What do you mean?

266
00:18:03,874 --> 00:18:05,584
Vomiting and diarrhea.

267
00:18:06,293 --> 00:18:08,128
More vomiting and diarrhea.

268
00:18:08,212 --> 00:18:09,338
Gross.

269
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:11,131
I'm afraidâ€¦

270
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:13,759
I'll have to be hospitalized.

271
00:18:15,302 --> 00:18:17,888
Tsetseg, the problem is

272
00:18:18,847 --> 00:18:22,392
that Hong Jeong-ho,
a part-timer on Logistics Team 3

273
00:18:23,143 --> 00:18:24,937
passed away yesterday.

274
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:27,606
-What?
-I'm dyingâ€¦

275
00:18:28,816 --> 00:18:30,067
at the moment.

276
00:18:31,276 --> 00:18:33,028
I need you to--

277
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:35,280
How did he die?

278
00:18:35,364 --> 00:18:37,950
I have no idea.

279
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:43,580
Someone needs to head
to the police station.

280
00:18:43,664 --> 00:18:45,207
Just a second.

281
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:48,627
The case is being investigated byâ€¦

282
00:18:54,049 --> 00:18:56,218
RECIPIENT: STRONG TSETSEG

283
00:19:04,101 --> 00:19:05,435
This year,

284
00:19:06,019 --> 00:19:08,147
I have a bigger picture in mind.

285
00:19:08,939 --> 00:19:12,025
I wish to transform
Geumju Daily into Geumju Mediaâ€¦

286
00:19:14,194 --> 00:19:19,616
and acquire struggling cable provider TGV
which has been in the red.

287
00:19:20,284 --> 00:19:23,287
Will a cable service that's bleeding money
be worth acquiring?

288
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:26,582
Isn't it about time
one of my businesses was in the red?

289
00:19:27,249 --> 00:19:29,376
Losing a few million here and there

290
00:19:29,459 --> 00:19:32,254
will make people believe
I'm just like anyone else.

291
00:19:32,337 --> 00:19:33,338
Right?

292
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:37,718
Something like that.

293
00:19:47,561 --> 00:19:48,854
The channelâ€¦

294
00:19:50,272 --> 00:19:52,482
will be called Geumju TV.

295
00:19:54,484 --> 00:19:55,485
He died of overexertion?

296
00:19:55,569 --> 00:19:57,738
His credit card debt
was over 40 million won.

297
00:19:57,821 --> 00:20:01,033
After his credit hit rock bottom,
he worked every job he could.

298
00:20:01,116 --> 00:20:03,035
He reported wanted criminals,

299
00:20:03,118 --> 00:20:05,495
reported illegal waste dumps,

300
00:20:05,579 --> 00:20:07,623
and did anything that paid money.

301
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:09,958
By day, he handled unloading
and deliveries for Doogo.

302
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:12,211
By night, he worked
as a designated driver.

303
00:20:12,294 --> 00:20:14,755
On his days off, he worked
at late-night street food vendors.

304
00:20:14,838 --> 00:20:16,882
He worked over 16 hours a day.

305
00:20:17,466 --> 00:20:19,718
But by the time he'd paid off his debt,

306
00:20:19,801 --> 00:20:21,970
he'd get evicted for not paying rent.

307
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:23,388
Talk about a vicious cycle.

308
00:20:23,472 --> 00:20:26,600
Are there people
who are that poor in Korea?

309
00:20:27,184 --> 00:20:30,979
Isn't it a country where hard work
is rewarded by a decent life?

310
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:32,314
That's what I heard.

311
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:37,236
I guess you had no clue
since you're from Mongolia.

312
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:40,030
Korea is just another country
on this planet

313
00:20:40,113 --> 00:20:41,490
and not a utopia.

314
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:45,035
The poor outnumber the rich
by a huge margin.

315
00:20:45,619 --> 00:20:48,080
Did he have any family?

316
00:20:48,163 --> 00:20:50,624
His younger brother
is still in high school.

317
00:20:50,707 --> 00:20:52,000
The boy lives with his aunt.

318
00:20:54,002 --> 00:20:57,130
The bereaved refused to claim his body.

319
00:20:57,214 --> 00:20:58,799
The local authorities
will carry out the funeral.

320
00:21:00,717 --> 00:21:02,177
Where does the aunt live?

321
00:21:04,054 --> 00:21:06,431
Mr. Hong Jeong-ho
who worked at the warehouse

322
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:07,891
died of overexertion.

323
00:21:07,975 --> 00:21:09,559
I'll start work tomorrow.

324
00:21:23,365 --> 00:21:25,200
Did one of the warehouse employees die?

325
00:21:25,867 --> 00:21:26,952
Yes, sir.

326
00:21:27,035 --> 00:21:30,289
Why didn't you report it to me
if you were aware of it?

327
00:21:30,372 --> 00:21:32,124
He wasn't a full-time employee

328
00:21:32,207 --> 00:21:33,875
and only worked here part-time.

329
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:36,295
He only joined two months ago

330
00:21:36,878 --> 00:21:38,880
and has been working numerous other jobs.

331
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:40,716
I didn't think it was important--

332
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:42,592
I'm the one who decides what's important!

333
00:21:43,635 --> 00:21:45,178
Who are you to make that decision?

334
00:21:45,262 --> 00:21:46,555
I apologize, sir.

335
00:21:46,638 --> 00:21:47,681
I won't do it again.

336
00:21:47,764 --> 00:21:49,266
An employee at Doogo diedâ€¦

337
00:21:50,517 --> 00:21:53,562
at a crucial time
when our corporate image must be spotless!

338
00:21:57,524 --> 00:21:58,358
And the media?

339
00:21:58,442 --> 00:22:01,528
All the reporters have been dealt with,
so there won't be any articles.

340
00:22:02,362 --> 00:22:03,905
Even if any were published,

341
00:22:04,573 --> 00:22:06,658
I was assured that Doogo
wouldn't be put on the spot.

342
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:09,286
Whyâ€¦

343
00:22:12,122 --> 00:22:14,291
Why did he have to die as my employee?
Talk about bad luck.

344
00:22:30,849 --> 00:22:32,267
YOUNGER BROTHER: HONG JEONG-MIN, AGE 17

345
00:22:40,358 --> 00:22:41,401
Hi.

346
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:44,863
I mean, hello.

347
00:22:45,614 --> 00:22:46,782
Can I help you?

348
00:22:46,865 --> 00:22:49,326
I'm Hong Jeong-ho's friend.

349
00:22:49,409 --> 00:22:50,452
His friend?

350
00:22:52,412 --> 00:22:54,164
Are you Jeong-min?

351
00:22:57,793 --> 00:23:00,003
Please pay for his funeral with this.

352
00:23:00,921 --> 00:23:03,882
I'll also provide Jeong-min
with tuition and allowance.

353
00:23:03,965 --> 00:23:07,511
So please raise him well.

354
00:23:10,388 --> 00:23:12,349
You must've been close to Jeong-ho

355
00:23:12,933 --> 00:23:14,184
to help out like this.

356
00:23:14,267 --> 00:23:17,270
We don't necessarily have to be close
to help each other out.

357
00:23:21,191 --> 00:23:22,275
Jeong-min.

358
00:23:22,776 --> 00:23:24,736
I grew up in Mongolia

359
00:23:25,445 --> 00:23:27,155
because I lost my Korean parents.

360
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:30,784
But even without them,

361
00:23:30,867 --> 00:23:32,994
I was dearly loved by my foster parents.

362
00:23:34,121 --> 00:23:36,998
Thanks to them, I grew up fine and well.

363
00:23:38,917 --> 00:23:39,918
I want toâ€¦

364
00:23:40,961 --> 00:23:42,462
return that favor to you.

365
00:23:49,845 --> 00:23:50,804
Don't cry.

366
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:53,890
In Mongolia,

367
00:23:53,974 --> 00:23:56,518
we don't cry after losing a loved one.

368
00:23:57,602 --> 00:24:01,106
They say that tears block the path
that the departed's soul must take.

369
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:02,899
So don't cry.

370
00:24:06,236 --> 00:24:07,362
Thank you.

371
00:24:12,659 --> 00:24:14,494
If there's anything you need,

372
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:16,204
call me.

373
00:24:21,001 --> 00:24:21,960
By the way,

374
00:24:22,586 --> 00:24:23,712
what's your name?

375
00:24:23,795 --> 00:24:24,838
It's Tsetseg.

376
00:24:29,176 --> 00:24:30,010
My name?

377
00:24:31,178 --> 00:24:32,262
It's Gang Nam-soon.

378
00:24:36,975 --> 00:24:38,894
We finally identified Hairtail.

379
00:24:38,977 --> 00:24:41,146
Name, Shin Gang-su. Age, 37.

380
00:24:41,229 --> 00:24:44,733
I couldn't dig up a rap sheet on him
let alone a drug charge.

381
00:24:44,816 --> 00:24:47,903
But apparently,
he studied ballet in Russia.

382
00:24:47,986 --> 00:24:49,196
-Ballet?
-Yes.

383
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:52,240
Well, it gets even more confusing.

384
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:53,825
According to his bank accounts,

385
00:24:53,909 --> 00:24:56,411
he's been receiving a salary
as an employee at Heritage Club.

386
00:24:56,494 --> 00:24:58,622
A hefty sum of more than 20 million won
every month.

387
00:24:58,705 --> 00:25:00,373
I haven't asked around what he does there.

388
00:25:00,457 --> 00:25:01,708
"Heritage Club"?

389
00:25:01,791 --> 00:25:04,544
It's a members-only club for the 0.01%,

390
00:25:04,628 --> 00:25:06,421
the elite among the elite.

391
00:25:07,005 --> 00:25:09,174
More like the wealthy than the elite.

392
00:25:09,257 --> 00:25:11,760
Those with political capital and wealth
gather at the club

393
00:25:11,843 --> 00:25:13,136
to form secret alliances.

394
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:14,763
Who acts as the control tower?

395
00:25:14,846 --> 00:25:15,972
This woman right here.

396
00:25:17,724 --> 00:25:18,808
The club's madam.

397
00:25:19,392 --> 00:25:23,271
But you should know
that Doogo's CEO Ryu Si-o

398
00:25:24,481 --> 00:25:25,357
is also a member.

399
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:32,781
How can I get a search warrant for Doogo?

400
00:25:32,864 --> 00:25:33,865
You need evidence.

401
00:25:33,949 --> 00:25:35,533
The problem is I don't have any.

402
00:25:35,617 --> 00:25:38,453
The trail to the distributors went cold
after Baldy's death, so I have nothing.

403
00:25:39,037 --> 00:25:40,622
Those who received the drugs
are also dead.

404
00:25:41,331 --> 00:25:43,124
We could request
a statutory audit of Doogo.

405
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:44,334
Right.

406
00:25:44,417 --> 00:25:47,337
But why have you been talking to me
like I'm your peer?

407
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:48,255
-What?
-What?

408
00:25:48,338 --> 00:25:49,339
-Pardon?
-Pardon?

409
00:25:49,422 --> 00:25:50,507
I was talking to myself.

410
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:52,300
No, we were having a conversation.

411
00:25:56,972 --> 00:25:59,557
What do you say
to drinks tonight, brother?

412
00:25:59,641 --> 00:26:00,475
She wants to have drinks.

413
00:26:00,558 --> 00:26:02,102
Is that Gang Nam-soon? I want in.

414
00:26:02,185 --> 00:26:03,687
I politely refuse. I'm sorry, Young-tak.

415
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:05,730
So now you're being polite.

416
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:08,066
Are you having drinks?

417
00:26:09,901 --> 00:26:10,944
Cheers.

418
00:26:28,378 --> 00:26:29,462
It's black raspberry wine.

419
00:26:30,046 --> 00:26:31,923
Try some when you wish to be happy.

420
00:26:32,007 --> 00:26:34,217
It'll grant you the ultimate bliss.

421
00:26:38,722 --> 00:26:40,015
Those are neckties.

422
00:26:42,976 --> 00:26:45,520
These gifts should be fine
to receive without trouble.

423
00:26:51,067 --> 00:26:52,694
Damn it.

424
00:27:19,554 --> 00:27:20,764
Gan I-sik.

425
00:27:20,847 --> 00:27:22,557
Didn't you say you were running late?

426
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:25,435
Gosh, how much did you drink?

427
00:27:27,645 --> 00:27:29,397
Alcohol is a mystery to me.

428
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:31,941
It's bitter but also sweet.

429
00:27:32,942 --> 00:27:34,277
Why are you drinking?

430
00:27:34,986 --> 00:27:36,780
I doubt it's because you're hungry.

431
00:27:36,863 --> 00:27:38,323
What a silly thing to say.

432
00:27:38,406 --> 00:27:40,450
Who drinks because they're hungry?

433
00:27:42,744 --> 00:27:45,413
Step back from this case.
I'll take care of the rest.

434
00:27:45,497 --> 00:27:46,998
But I'm just getting started.

435
00:27:47,082 --> 00:27:49,000
Ryu Si-o's a dangerous man.

436
00:27:49,084 --> 00:27:50,502
I can't let you be by his side.

437
00:27:51,086 --> 00:27:53,171
I'm not "being by his side."

438
00:27:53,254 --> 00:27:55,673
I'm choosing to keep him around me.

439
00:27:55,757 --> 00:27:58,635
The one in danger isn't me but him.

440
00:28:10,313 --> 00:28:11,398
Gan I-sik.

441
00:28:12,690 --> 00:28:15,860
A coworker at Doogo's warehouse

442
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:18,655
died yesterday.

443
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,785
I know. Officer Yeo informed me.

444
00:28:24,452 --> 00:28:25,537
He was the oneâ€¦

445
00:28:26,913 --> 00:28:29,040
who reported that Ri Hwa-ja was at Doogo.

446
00:28:30,834 --> 00:28:34,295
Could Ri Hwa-ja be involved
in his death somehow?

447
00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:36,714
The force ran an investigation
from that angle,

448
00:28:36,798 --> 00:28:38,758
but it turns out
he did die of overexertion.

449
00:28:38,842 --> 00:28:41,553
Everything was caught on his dashcam.

450
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:45,598
He died from the energy drinks
he kept drinking to stay awake.

451
00:28:46,182 --> 00:28:50,228
How can one die
from working too many hours?

452
00:28:50,311 --> 00:28:52,021
That shouldn't happen to anyone.

453
00:28:58,778 --> 00:29:01,364
The fact that
there are rich people like your momâ€¦

454
00:29:03,575 --> 00:29:05,785
means there are others who are very poor.

455
00:29:07,412 --> 00:29:09,706
Capitalism is like gambling.

456
00:29:09,789 --> 00:29:11,166
There's a fixed pool of money.

457
00:29:12,917 --> 00:29:15,670
Someone must lose for someone to win.

458
00:29:17,547 --> 00:29:18,673
Capitalism.

459
00:29:19,549 --> 00:29:20,925
Like light and shadow.

460
00:29:23,595 --> 00:29:25,597
Where there is light, there is shadow.

461
00:29:29,476 --> 00:29:30,560
Iâ€¦

462
00:29:31,227 --> 00:29:32,979
want to run into the shadows

463
00:29:34,022 --> 00:29:35,482
and be the light for people.

464
00:29:38,818 --> 00:29:41,613
I'm going to make that happen.

465
00:29:47,035 --> 00:29:48,411
Go ahead.

466
00:29:48,495 --> 00:29:49,704
I'll be here to help you.

467
00:29:54,876 --> 00:29:56,085
There's a good boy.

468
00:29:56,169 --> 00:29:58,713
Jeez, you're being cheeky again.

469
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:01,758
Anywayâ€¦

470
00:30:04,969 --> 00:30:06,221
Get your driver's license.

471
00:30:06,304 --> 00:30:07,639
I'll teach you to drive.

472
00:30:09,474 --> 00:30:11,142
There are so many words.

473
00:30:13,311 --> 00:30:14,813
WRITTEN EXAM PREP
FOR YOUR DRIVER'S LICENSE

474
00:30:14,896 --> 00:30:16,147
Having rosy cheeksâ€¦

475
00:30:19,067 --> 00:30:20,068
makes you look pretty.

476
00:30:26,157 --> 00:30:28,201
Do you like girls with rosy cheeks?

477
00:30:28,284 --> 00:30:29,994
There are a lot of them in Mongolia.

478
00:30:30,078 --> 00:30:31,913
Is that so?

479
00:30:31,996 --> 00:30:33,790
Then I should visit sometime.

480
00:30:34,332 --> 00:30:35,583
Why would you go there

481
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:37,961
when you can just date me?

482
00:30:44,259 --> 00:30:46,052
You're being cheeky again.

483
00:30:48,429 --> 00:30:50,390
I love you.

484
00:30:52,475 --> 00:30:55,019
I love you.

485
00:30:57,146 --> 00:30:59,023
What does that mean?

486
00:31:00,733 --> 00:31:02,819
I love you.

487
00:31:04,445 --> 00:31:05,321
Hey.

488
00:31:07,323 --> 00:31:08,783
-Thank you.
-Goodbye.

489
00:31:13,705 --> 00:31:14,622
Hey.

490
00:31:23,923 --> 00:31:24,799
Get on.

491
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:38,271
Getting a ride from you
reminds me of Ppappa.

492
00:31:39,147 --> 00:31:41,524
My sweet horse
who used to take me everywhere.

493
00:31:42,942 --> 00:31:44,277
Are you calling me a horse?

494
00:31:44,861 --> 00:31:47,322
You just can't help being cheeky, can you?

495
00:31:50,033 --> 00:31:52,035
Giddy up!

496
00:31:58,625 --> 00:32:00,460
-Right?
-Wasn't that incredible?

497
00:32:00,543 --> 00:32:01,794
Tell me about it.

498
00:32:01,878 --> 00:32:04,422
-My husband insisted.
-My goodness.

499
00:32:05,798 --> 00:32:08,551
It sure was nice to get out on a yacht.

500
00:32:08,635 --> 00:32:10,178
There's no place like Busan

501
00:32:10,261 --> 00:32:12,680
-to look at the sea and lighten your mood.
-Of course.

502
00:32:12,764 --> 00:32:14,891
-Do you agree, Ms. Hwang?
-I do.

503
00:32:14,974 --> 00:32:17,143
Would you like to go golfing next?

504
00:32:17,226 --> 00:32:19,687
-I'd love that!
-That'd be great!

505
00:32:19,771 --> 00:32:21,856
I've been on a lucky streak lately.

506
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:23,942
You should see me on the putting green.

507
00:32:24,025 --> 00:32:26,486
-I score hole-in-ones.
-I score birdies.

508
00:32:27,403 --> 00:32:28,363
Let's go.

509
00:32:28,446 --> 00:32:31,199
Did something good happen recently?

510
00:32:31,282 --> 00:32:32,450
It's Bread Song.

511
00:32:32,992 --> 00:32:34,577
He's quite the genius.

512
00:32:34,661 --> 00:32:36,746
He has already doubled my investment.

513
00:32:36,829 --> 00:32:38,957
-Goodness.
-Bread is brilliant.

514
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:40,583
Isn't he the best?

515
00:32:40,667 --> 00:32:43,002
-Tell me about it.
-My dear Bread.

516
00:32:47,048 --> 00:32:48,299
-Nice shot.
-Nice shot.

517
00:32:51,135 --> 00:32:52,929
Isn't he a scammer?

518
00:32:53,012 --> 00:32:54,055
A scammer?

519
00:32:56,099 --> 00:32:57,100
Ms. Hwang,

520
00:32:57,183 --> 00:32:58,768
we're not a bunch of suckers.

521
00:32:58,851 --> 00:33:03,690
Please don't tell me you believe
he was a Wall Street hotshot.

522
00:33:04,190 --> 00:33:05,650
None of that matters.

523
00:33:05,733 --> 00:33:07,777
How could it not?

524
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:09,904
It means he approached you
under false pretenses.

525
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:13,032
He has never introduced himself
as a former Wall Street analyst.

526
00:33:13,116 --> 00:33:15,284
It's something of a myth we created.

527
00:33:15,368 --> 00:33:17,745
-Hey, you're in the lead.
-Thanks.

528
00:33:17,829 --> 00:33:20,081
Of course we did our homework.

529
00:33:20,164 --> 00:33:23,459
But there was no way
to find out who he was.

530
00:33:23,543 --> 00:33:25,003
He's untraceable.

531
00:33:25,086 --> 00:33:27,296
That's what's strange about him.

532
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:30,258
How can one be untraceable
in this transparent world we live in?

533
00:33:31,175 --> 00:33:33,469
-Is he a ghost?
-He's making us money.

534
00:33:33,553 --> 00:33:36,889
Thanks to Bread,
everyone here made a profit.

535
00:33:36,973 --> 00:33:40,184
All our shell corporations
are running smoothly under borrowed names.

536
00:33:44,355 --> 00:33:45,606
-Nice birdie.
-Nice!

537
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:47,984
Have you looked into those borrowed names?

538
00:33:48,067 --> 00:33:49,777
What's there to check

539
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:51,821
when we chose them ourselves?

540
00:33:54,824 --> 00:33:56,492
Homeless people

541
00:33:56,576 --> 00:33:59,370
who'd gladly let us borrow their names
for a mere million won

542
00:33:59,454 --> 00:34:01,414
can easily be found around Seoul Station.

543
00:34:01,497 --> 00:34:05,209
The name on his business card

544
00:34:05,293 --> 00:34:07,962
isn't "Brad" as in Brad Pitt.

545
00:34:08,046 --> 00:34:09,464
It's "Bread" as in baked goods.

546
00:34:10,089 --> 00:34:11,674
That alone is ridiculous.

547
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:13,509
How can one's name be Bread?

548
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:16,012
Right? It's hilarious.

549
00:34:16,888 --> 00:34:18,097
That's how Bread is.

550
00:34:18,181 --> 00:34:20,266
He has a remarkable sense of humor.

551
00:34:20,349 --> 00:34:22,060
His name means bread.

552
00:34:23,478 --> 00:34:26,773
I asked why his name was spelled that way,

553
00:34:26,856 --> 00:34:29,233
and he said it was because he loves bread.

554
00:34:29,317 --> 00:34:31,527
He said he could live on bread
all his life

555
00:34:33,029 --> 00:34:34,614
as long as it's not Choco Pie.

556
00:34:36,032 --> 00:34:37,825
Why is that an exception?

557
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:40,453
Who knows? But I doubt that's important.

558
00:34:41,245 --> 00:34:42,080
I didn't ask.

559
00:34:44,082 --> 00:34:45,249
It's your turn.

560
00:34:46,417 --> 00:34:47,376
Right.

561
00:34:53,257 --> 00:34:55,093
I let my guard down. Damn it.

562
00:34:58,888 --> 00:35:00,098
I bet that startled you.

563
00:35:01,474 --> 00:35:03,017
It's a magic putter.

564
00:35:04,102 --> 00:35:05,436
Gosh, where is it from?

565
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:06,604
-What is this?
-Hold on.

566
00:35:06,687 --> 00:35:08,272
-What brand is this?
-Is the material different?

567
00:35:13,069 --> 00:35:14,028
Goodness.

568
00:35:14,112 --> 00:35:17,073
-It's fascinating.
-It must be a limited edition.

569
00:35:17,156 --> 00:35:18,616
-Really?
-I bet it was imported.

570
00:35:18,699 --> 00:35:21,077
-Exactly.
-What do you think?

571
00:35:21,869 --> 00:35:25,123
The information you provided us
wasn't enough to uncover his identity.

572
00:35:25,706 --> 00:35:28,459
That Bread Song is a mystery.

573
00:35:29,544 --> 00:35:31,295
Who is this jerk?

574
00:35:32,338 --> 00:35:33,673
Is he really a ghost?

575
00:35:36,551 --> 00:35:38,302
Can you send me his photo?

576
00:35:38,386 --> 00:35:39,595
His photo?

577
00:35:40,221 --> 00:35:41,222
His photo.

578
00:35:51,858 --> 00:35:53,609
HWANG GEUM-JU

579
00:35:53,693 --> 00:35:55,695
Send me a photo of Bread.

580
00:35:56,445 --> 00:35:57,363
Bread.

581
00:36:00,575 --> 00:36:03,744
NUMBERS FREAK

582
00:36:03,828 --> 00:36:05,288
What's wrong with him?

583
00:36:05,371 --> 00:36:07,123
Even his jokes aren't on point.

584
00:36:13,379 --> 00:36:16,174
I want a photo of the person
known as Bread.

585
00:36:16,257 --> 00:36:18,718
You know, Mr. Bread.

586
00:36:18,801 --> 00:36:20,011
"Mr. Bread."

587
00:36:21,137 --> 00:36:23,556
Why would she need his photo?

588
00:36:28,936 --> 00:36:30,354
Why do you need his photo?

589
00:36:38,446 --> 00:36:39,530
I just do.

590
00:36:40,156 --> 00:36:41,324
He'sâ€¦

591
00:36:42,241 --> 00:36:43,576
my type.

592
00:36:50,082 --> 00:36:52,126
I can't believe you said that, Geum-ju.

593
00:36:53,169 --> 00:36:54,503
You must be out of your mind.

594
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,518
That woman gets on my nerves.

595
00:37:10,269 --> 00:37:12,188
She's clearly stalking me.

596
00:37:12,772 --> 00:37:16,567
How the hell did she find out
where I was seeing Ms. Gong?

597
00:37:17,401 --> 00:37:19,528
It's as if someone gave up my coordinates.

598
00:37:20,738 --> 00:37:21,948
Did you tell her?

599
00:37:23,574 --> 00:37:24,742
Of course not.

600
00:37:24,825 --> 00:37:26,035
A scammer?

601
00:37:26,118 --> 00:37:28,371
In what way do I seem like one?

602
00:37:29,121 --> 00:37:30,539
This is defamation.

603
00:37:30,623 --> 00:37:34,377
Well, I've gotten to know her recently.

604
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:35,962
-Hong-do.
-Yes?

605
00:37:36,045 --> 00:37:39,048
You shouldn't be getting close
to people like her.

606
00:37:40,049 --> 00:37:41,592
Keep yourself busy instead.

607
00:37:41,676 --> 00:37:45,012
She sent me three years' worth
of her company's financial statements.

608
00:37:45,096 --> 00:37:47,223
-Why?
-She said it was to show off.

609
00:37:47,306 --> 00:37:49,558
She really does get on my nerves.

610
00:37:57,358 --> 00:37:59,235
Her wealth is on another level.

611
00:37:59,318 --> 00:38:01,654
Her net worth is impossible to estimate.

612
00:38:01,737 --> 00:38:04,573
I came across this information
through a different channel.

613
00:38:04,657 --> 00:38:05,825
How much does she have?

614
00:38:08,077 --> 00:38:09,620
At least tens of trillions of won.

615
00:38:09,704 --> 00:38:12,665
Last year's aggregate income tax alone
cost her 200 billion won.

616
00:38:12,748 --> 00:38:13,833
She said soâ€¦

617
00:38:14,709 --> 00:38:15,668
herself.

618
00:38:20,923 --> 00:38:22,842
-Really?
-Also,

619
00:38:22,925 --> 00:38:24,468
she's single.

620
00:38:25,803 --> 00:38:26,971
Is that so?

621
00:38:27,054 --> 00:38:30,141
She also seemed interested in you.

622
00:38:31,976 --> 00:38:33,019
That's whyâ€¦

623
00:38:36,731 --> 00:38:40,526
Man, all ladies are the same.

624
00:38:58,836 --> 00:39:00,504
-Stick out your arm.
-Okay.

625
00:39:00,588 --> 00:39:04,425
This is a special watch
equipped with a GPS tracker

626
00:39:04,508 --> 00:39:07,011
and a hidden camera.

627
00:39:08,763 --> 00:39:11,682
It feels like I've become
the main character of a spy movie.

628
00:39:12,224 --> 00:39:13,934
I know I keep saying this,

629
00:39:14,018 --> 00:39:15,853
but don't get cheeky, all right?

630
00:39:15,936 --> 00:39:18,397
Don't touch anything in there

631
00:39:18,481 --> 00:39:21,442
and hold up your wrist
toward what has to be filmed.

632
00:39:21,525 --> 00:39:23,778
Don't forget to turn it off
before going to the bathroom.

633
00:39:27,073 --> 00:39:28,407
What the heck?

634
00:39:41,712 --> 00:39:44,423
Hi!

635
00:39:45,841 --> 00:39:47,468
I'm Tsetseg.

636
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:49,095
I hope we get along.

637
00:39:49,970 --> 00:39:50,930
Where do I sit?

638
00:40:03,901 --> 00:40:04,860
Hello?

639
00:40:04,944 --> 00:40:07,071
Tsetseg, meet me in my office.

640
00:40:07,905 --> 00:40:09,281
Got it, I'll be there.

641
00:40:15,871 --> 00:40:16,872
I'll be back, guys!

642
00:40:25,256 --> 00:40:26,757
I can't share the file with you.

643
00:40:26,841 --> 00:40:29,760
You must memorize what's on the paper
and destroy it immediately.

644
00:40:29,844 --> 00:40:31,512
Once Mr. Yoon prints it out for you,

645
00:40:31,595 --> 00:40:33,264
memorize all that's on it.

646
00:40:33,347 --> 00:40:35,516
You'll have to meet these people.

647
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:36,559
Got it.

648
00:40:37,143 --> 00:40:38,144
By the way,

649
00:40:39,019 --> 00:40:41,147
who are these people?

650
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:44,024
They're my domestic partners.

651
00:40:44,650 --> 00:40:46,193
My international partners
are for another time.

652
00:40:46,277 --> 00:40:48,446
Why did you test me on my strength

653
00:40:48,529 --> 00:40:50,865
when this is the kind of work
you're giving me?

654
00:40:51,449 --> 00:40:52,450
I don't get it.

655
00:40:55,161 --> 00:40:56,495
You'll find out soon enough,

656
00:40:57,997 --> 00:41:01,208
but you're the only one
who can help me in my endeavors.

657
00:41:02,084 --> 00:41:03,544
It's so dangerousâ€¦

658
00:41:05,754 --> 00:41:07,548
that one has to be completely fearless.

659
00:41:12,553 --> 00:41:14,138
A strong person has no fear,

660
00:41:14,638 --> 00:41:15,764
which meansâ€¦

661
00:41:17,266 --> 00:41:18,976
they can do anything.

662
00:41:23,314 --> 00:41:24,398
Got it.

663
00:41:27,985 --> 00:41:29,945
-Why are you smiling?
-Should I cry instead?

664
00:41:33,282 --> 00:41:35,117
Also, don't address me as Mr. Ryu.

665
00:41:35,201 --> 00:41:36,410
Call me Si-o instead.

666
00:41:37,328 --> 00:41:38,787
Sure, Si-o.

667
00:41:39,997 --> 00:41:40,873
Sounds good.

668
00:41:43,417 --> 00:41:46,629
Print this out for me
so I can memorize their names and faces.

669
00:41:46,712 --> 00:41:48,964
It'll take some time
for me to get them all.

670
00:41:49,048 --> 00:41:50,007
Sure.

671
00:41:51,091 --> 00:41:52,801
I'll need you to change your name.

672
00:41:52,885 --> 00:41:54,929
Choose an English one
to use in and out of the office.

673
00:41:58,015 --> 00:41:58,891
How about Hillary?

674
00:41:58,974 --> 00:42:00,768
-Hillary?
-Yes.

675
00:42:00,851 --> 00:42:03,020
My dad's name is Khan,

676
00:42:03,103 --> 00:42:05,814
and my Mongolian name is Khan Tsetseg.

677
00:42:05,898 --> 00:42:07,900
In Mongolia,
the dad's name works as a surname.

678
00:42:07,983 --> 00:42:09,235
That would make meâ€¦

679
00:42:10,027 --> 00:42:11,403
Hillary Khan.

680
00:42:12,488 --> 00:42:13,405
Cool, isn't it?

681
00:42:14,156 --> 00:42:16,534
Yes, it's cool. Go by that name then.

682
00:42:17,201 --> 00:42:18,577
Why is he looking at her like that?

683
00:42:18,661 --> 00:42:20,120
"Call me Si-o."

684
00:42:20,704 --> 00:42:21,872
"Hillary?"

685
00:42:21,956 --> 00:42:24,667
He'd better not change
his name to Clinton.

686
00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:25,876
Is he out of his mind?

687
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:27,503
You're out of your mind.

688
00:42:29,672 --> 00:42:30,881
Where are you going?

689
00:42:31,549 --> 00:42:32,466
Where are we going?

690
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:33,884
You'll see.

691
00:42:33,968 --> 00:42:36,262
Where are you taking her, you punk?

692
00:42:36,345 --> 00:42:37,763
What are you doing?

693
00:42:37,846 --> 00:42:39,932
I got the whereabouts
of Heritage's Madam Kim. Come on.

694
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:41,934
Got it.

695
00:42:54,655 --> 00:42:58,409
"Jung Dae-cheol, director of TBO."

696
00:42:58,492 --> 00:43:02,121
"Kim Gi-yeol, vice minister
of the Ministry of Economy and Finance."

697
00:43:02,204 --> 00:43:04,206
"Kang Hye-jeong, lawyer."

698
00:43:04,290 --> 00:43:07,001
"Open brackets,
managing partner of Law Firm Atlantic,

699
00:43:07,084 --> 00:43:08,794
close brackets."

700
00:43:09,962 --> 00:43:12,798
Do you have to
read it out loud to memorize it?

701
00:43:12,881 --> 00:43:14,967
Yeah, that's how I memorize things.

702
00:43:16,719 --> 00:43:17,970
Am I being too loud?

703
00:43:18,846 --> 00:43:20,889
It's fine. Keep going.

704
00:43:23,267 --> 00:43:27,021
Why is it that Jung Dae-cheol
and Kim Gi-yeol

705
00:43:27,104 --> 00:43:29,523
look so much alike?

706
00:43:29,607 --> 00:43:31,567
I can't tell them apart. What do I do?

707
00:43:31,650 --> 00:43:33,152
If you can't remember their names,

708
00:43:33,902 --> 00:43:35,195
just address them as "sir."

709
00:43:36,655 --> 00:43:37,781
"Sir"?

710
00:43:38,616 --> 00:43:39,700
As in old man?

711
00:43:41,577 --> 00:43:42,703
Old man

712
00:43:42,786 --> 00:43:43,787
What is it?

713
00:43:43,871 --> 00:43:45,998
Have you seen a chick with a leash

714
00:43:46,081 --> 00:43:48,167
I left in the backyard?

715
00:43:48,250 --> 00:43:49,126
I did

716
00:43:49,209 --> 00:43:50,210
What did you do with it?

717
00:43:50,294 --> 00:43:52,046
Si-o, you're up.

718
00:43:52,671 --> 00:43:54,798
My old age was bringing me down

719
00:43:54,882 --> 00:43:56,884
So I ate it to replenish my energy

720
00:43:56,967 --> 00:43:59,011
Well done, great job

721
00:43:59,094 --> 00:44:01,388
Your turn, Si-o!

722
00:44:01,472 --> 00:44:04,892
My old age was bringing me down

723
00:44:05,684 --> 00:44:08,520
-So I ate it to replenish my energy
-So I ate it to replenish my energy

724
00:44:08,604 --> 00:44:10,689
Well done, great job

725
00:44:10,773 --> 00:44:13,400
Well done, great job!

726
00:44:13,484 --> 00:44:16,779
-Are you kidding me?
-I expected no less from my hubby

727
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:21,617
Madam Kim's here.

728
00:44:23,202 --> 00:44:24,787
Wait. Who is she with?

729
00:44:24,870 --> 00:44:27,831
"Yang Hui-sook,
assemblywoman of the Seonghwang Party."

730
00:44:31,126 --> 00:44:34,254
Where did you learn that song
while living in Mongolia?

731
00:44:34,338 --> 00:44:37,299
I learned it from the old lady
who taught me Korean.

732
00:44:38,092 --> 00:44:40,886
She said songs are the best tool
when learning a new language.

733
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:43,972
Ga, na, da, ra, ma, ba, sa

734
00:44:44,056 --> 00:44:46,058
Ah, ja, cha, ka, ta, pa, ha

735
00:45:09,415 --> 00:45:11,959
Jun-hee, we should dance.

736
00:45:12,042 --> 00:45:13,752
-You want to dance?
-Yes, dance.

737
00:45:13,836 --> 00:45:15,712
You want to dance
in the middle of the road?

738
00:45:15,796 --> 00:45:17,256
Of course.

739
00:45:17,339 --> 00:45:20,050
They do so in Hollywood movies.

740
00:45:20,134 --> 00:45:21,635
Why should we care
about what others think?

741
00:45:21,718 --> 00:45:23,929
The weather is so lovely today.

742
00:45:24,555 --> 00:45:25,973
Let's do it then.

743
00:45:27,891 --> 00:45:29,017
This is great.

744
00:45:52,082 --> 00:45:53,792
-Joong-gan.
-Yes?

745
00:45:53,876 --> 00:45:55,169
Your name may mean "in the middle,"

746
00:45:55,711 --> 00:45:58,839
but there's nothing moderate about you,
my dear Joong-gan.

747
00:46:00,340 --> 00:46:03,177
My Jun-hee,
who has a trendy name despite his age.

748
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:04,511
What is it?

749
00:46:05,095 --> 00:46:06,096
Why don't weâ€¦

750
00:46:06,597 --> 00:46:08,098
move in together?

751
00:46:09,766 --> 00:46:11,643
My gosh.

752
00:46:11,727 --> 00:46:14,813
Now that you're warmed up,
you only know how to speed up.

753
00:46:16,023 --> 00:46:19,735
We live life not knowing
where we come from

754
00:46:19,818 --> 00:46:21,361
or where we'll end up after death,

755
00:46:21,445 --> 00:46:22,863
so what could possibly matter?

756
00:46:23,572 --> 00:46:26,241
We should follow our hearts.

757
00:46:26,325 --> 00:46:27,951
Goodness me.

758
00:46:42,508 --> 00:46:43,467
She's going in.

759
00:46:53,519 --> 00:46:55,562
Wait. Are they in the same place?

760
00:46:55,646 --> 00:46:57,022
This must be Heritage Club.

761
00:47:04,821 --> 00:47:06,907
Hold on a second. This guyâ€¦

762
00:47:07,616 --> 00:47:08,992
Didn't he give Baldy the mask?

763
00:47:09,076 --> 00:47:10,202
Yes, it's him.

764
00:47:10,786 --> 00:47:12,621
Welcome, Mr. Ryu.

765
00:47:13,747 --> 00:47:15,832
She's the lobbyist who'll be aiding me.

766
00:47:16,959 --> 00:47:17,918
Introduce yourself.

767
00:47:20,504 --> 00:47:23,632
Hello, I'm Hillary Khan.

768
00:47:23,715 --> 00:47:24,633
Right.

769
00:47:25,551 --> 00:47:26,843
I'm Marie Kim.

770
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:31,682
Hand over your duties to Tsetsegâ€¦

771
00:47:32,766 --> 00:47:34,017
I mean, Hillary.

772
00:47:35,394 --> 00:47:36,812
What exactly is this place?

773
00:47:36,895 --> 00:47:39,606
This is one of the places
where you'll meet others for work.

774
00:47:40,399 --> 00:47:41,567
Teach her everything

775
00:47:41,650 --> 00:47:43,819
from mahjong and cards to board games.

776
00:47:43,902 --> 00:47:45,070
Mr. Ryu,

777
00:47:45,862 --> 00:47:47,114
may I have a word?

778
00:47:50,117 --> 00:47:51,368
Wait inside.

779
00:47:52,119 --> 00:47:53,036
Sure.

780
00:48:02,546 --> 00:48:04,339
Who the hell is she?

781
00:48:04,423 --> 00:48:05,716
I told you earlier.

782
00:48:05,799 --> 00:48:07,092
She's my aide.

783
00:48:07,175 --> 00:48:10,012
What do you mean
she's taking over my work?

784
00:48:12,431 --> 00:48:14,308
To what extent will she be replacing me?

785
00:48:16,184 --> 00:48:17,269
Even Paul?

786
00:48:17,978 --> 00:48:18,854
I'mâ€¦

787
00:48:20,439 --> 00:48:21,857
going to make her mine.

788
00:48:24,276 --> 00:48:26,236
She didn't become strong due to drugs.

789
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:28,947
She was born with that strength.

790
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:34,161
She may be a gift from above.

791
00:48:37,039 --> 00:48:37,873
Not too fast.

792
00:48:39,333 --> 00:48:41,293
I'm the one handing over my work,

793
00:48:41,376 --> 00:48:43,837
so she should win my trust as well.

794
00:48:44,838 --> 00:48:45,714
Don't you think so?

795
00:49:16,244 --> 00:49:18,872
To work with Mr. Ryu,
you must be able to hold your liquor.

796
00:49:28,215 --> 00:49:29,049
Drink up.

797
00:49:59,121 --> 00:50:00,956
How will you protect Mr. Ryu

798
00:50:01,039 --> 00:50:02,833
if you trust people so easily?

799
00:50:04,710 --> 00:50:06,545
You drank something a stranger gave you.

800
00:50:09,464 --> 00:50:11,133
Hey, wait.

801
00:50:12,050 --> 00:50:14,803
You drank a trace amount of tetrodotoxin,

802
00:50:14,886 --> 00:50:17,889
so you'll be fully paralyzed
for three hours.

803
00:50:22,769 --> 00:50:24,438
Was that another test?

804
00:50:30,193 --> 00:50:32,446
That was the strongest
I've had in a while.

805
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:36,992
Back in Mongolia, I even
ate a stone that was heated by fire.

806
00:50:38,744 --> 00:50:41,705
Khorkhog is made by placing stones
in an animal's organ before cooking.

807
00:50:41,788 --> 00:50:45,000
I was so hungry
that I mistook a stone for meat

808
00:50:45,083 --> 00:50:47,461
and ended up eating it.

809
00:50:48,837 --> 00:50:51,214
Poison like this is nothing.

810
00:50:51,798 --> 00:50:52,632
Sit.

811
00:51:19,075 --> 00:51:19,910
Yes.

812
00:51:23,622 --> 00:51:24,748
Hey!

813
00:51:24,831 --> 00:51:25,832
Get back here!

814
00:51:32,172 --> 00:51:33,715
The clinical trial is over.

815
00:51:35,258 --> 00:51:36,218
I tried it myself.

816
00:51:38,553 --> 00:51:39,513
It's perfect.

817
00:51:40,889 --> 00:51:42,307
She's fine.

818
00:51:49,356 --> 00:51:50,941
Drink up.

819
00:52:11,169 --> 00:52:13,296
Bread Song.

820
00:52:15,006 --> 00:52:15,841
Ms. Hwang.

821
00:52:18,051 --> 00:52:18,885
Right.

822
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:24,140
"Name, Kim Jeong-suk."

823
00:52:24,224 --> 00:52:27,227
"Born in Seoul in 1983."

824
00:52:27,310 --> 00:52:29,104
"Alumna of Jeonghwa Women's University."

825
00:52:29,187 --> 00:52:31,815
"Worked as a fund manager
at Inyeong Securities."

826
00:52:32,858 --> 00:52:33,692
I see.

827
00:52:34,776 --> 00:52:36,403
Send Inspector Kang the link to our cloud.

828
00:52:36,486 --> 00:52:37,529
Yes, ma'am.

829
00:52:45,036 --> 00:52:48,123
I'm uploading Madam Kim's file
as requested, so please take a look.

830
00:52:49,583 --> 00:52:51,459
Money rules in capitalism, does it not?

831
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:55,422
The information was bought,
so its quality will be top-notch.

832
00:52:55,505 --> 00:52:57,299
Do you know much about Heritage Club?

833
00:52:59,467 --> 00:53:00,302
Of course.

834
00:53:01,094 --> 00:53:02,637
I'm a member there.

835
00:53:03,346 --> 00:53:05,599
It's where I met Ryu Si-o.

836
00:53:05,682 --> 00:53:09,603
Ryu Si-o is a member of Pavel,
a Russian mafia group.

837
00:53:10,228 --> 00:53:12,272
-"Pavel"?
-Yes.

838
00:53:13,648 --> 00:53:16,568
Anyway, where's Nam-soon right now?

839
00:53:47,265 --> 00:53:48,975
There are no bugs.

840
00:53:52,812 --> 00:53:55,065
Today's quota has been delivered.

841
00:55:18,023 --> 00:55:20,275
Si-o, the madam is out cold.

842
00:55:23,153 --> 00:55:24,446
I'm drunk.

843
00:55:24,529 --> 00:55:25,989
I'd like to go home and sleep.

844
00:55:26,072 --> 00:55:27,532
You've already decided on your own.

845
00:55:28,616 --> 00:55:30,577
All right. Head home.

846
00:55:30,660 --> 00:55:32,662
Got it. Off I go.

847
00:55:42,088 --> 00:55:44,424
BONG PHOTO GALLERY

848
00:55:44,507 --> 00:55:45,842
RECIPIENT: GANG NAM-IN
SENDER: QUICK WEIGHT LOSS

849
00:56:13,369 --> 00:56:15,163
Hey, are you all right?

850
00:56:15,747 --> 00:56:17,165
Do you need a doctor?

851
00:56:17,248 --> 00:56:20,585
This is right up my alley.

852
00:56:22,170 --> 00:56:23,797
-What?
-Being a spy.

853
00:56:25,507 --> 00:56:27,300
I filmed every corner of Heritage Club.

854
00:56:28,426 --> 00:56:31,346
I'm sure this place
has something to do with drugs.

855
00:56:31,888 --> 00:56:34,349
The text Madam Kim received
seemed suspicious.

856
00:56:34,432 --> 00:56:36,101
I'll go to his office tonight

857
00:56:36,184 --> 00:56:38,728
and get the client list.

858
00:56:38,812 --> 00:56:41,689
It won't be as poorly guarded
as you think it will be.

859
00:56:41,773 --> 00:56:43,733
No, I can do it.

860
00:56:44,234 --> 00:56:46,277
I have my own access card,

861
00:56:46,361 --> 00:56:49,072
so I can get the master key card
from the security office.

862
00:56:49,155 --> 00:56:51,116
What if you get caught?

863
00:56:51,199 --> 00:56:52,700
It isn't like the warehouse.

864
00:56:52,784 --> 00:56:54,994
As if I wouldn't know that.

865
00:56:55,537 --> 00:56:56,454
I'll be in costume.

866
00:56:56,538 --> 00:56:58,873
No, I'll be completely disguised.

867
00:56:58,957 --> 00:57:01,042
No one will recognize it's me.

868
00:57:02,377 --> 00:57:03,545
Once I make a run for it,

869
00:57:03,628 --> 00:57:05,588
no one will be able to catch me.

870
00:57:05,672 --> 00:57:08,424
Even if I'm on the security footage,
there'll be no evidence.

871
00:57:08,508 --> 00:57:11,928
Aren't we doing this
because we have no hard evidence on Doogo?

872
00:57:12,011 --> 00:57:13,471
What kind of a disguiseâ€¦

873
00:57:14,514 --> 00:57:15,849
are you suggesting?

874
00:57:17,058 --> 00:57:18,393
Leave it to me.

875
00:57:18,476 --> 00:57:19,769
Don't you know who I am?

876
00:57:20,353 --> 00:57:21,438
I'm Gang Nam-soon.

877
00:57:30,697 --> 00:57:33,700
We do have to hack into
the security camera system anyway.

878
00:57:35,410 --> 00:57:38,830
Why don't we radio you
while monitoring via your watch and--

879
00:57:38,913 --> 00:57:39,873
-Right.
-No.

880
00:57:41,791 --> 00:57:43,209
It'll only get in the way.

881
00:58:07,066 --> 00:58:08,067
I'M AT THE LOCATION

882
00:58:19,537 --> 00:58:21,039
We finally identified Hairtail.

883
00:58:21,122 --> 00:58:23,333
Name, Shin Gang-su. Age, 37.

884
00:58:23,416 --> 00:58:26,503
I couldn't dig up a rap sheet on him
let alone a drug charge.

885
00:58:33,301 --> 00:58:34,594
Ryu Si-o.

886
00:58:44,604 --> 00:58:45,772
What the hell?

887
00:58:46,773 --> 00:58:48,483
This guy is everywhere.

888
00:58:49,567 --> 00:58:51,611
Bread Song, you jerk.

889
00:58:52,237 --> 00:58:54,239
What are you doing there?

890
00:58:54,948 --> 00:58:56,115
No way.

891
00:59:01,663 --> 00:59:03,915
Why did I trust her
and let her go in on her own?

892
00:59:03,998 --> 00:59:05,583
To the CEO's office of all places.

893
00:59:05,667 --> 00:59:06,834
Come on.

894
00:59:06,918 --> 00:59:09,045
It seemed like she had a plan.

895
00:59:09,128 --> 00:59:11,256
I'm sure she has a professional disguise,

896
00:59:11,339 --> 00:59:13,299
as well as special equipment and devices.

897
00:59:13,383 --> 00:59:15,385
You know, like in Mission Impossible.

898
00:59:15,468 --> 00:59:17,929
Any operation begins with funding.

899
00:59:18,012 --> 00:59:20,515
Agent Gang's super strength
and her mother's wealth

900
00:59:20,598 --> 00:59:22,809
will create synergy like no other
once combined.

901
00:59:44,914 --> 00:59:47,083
Doogo's cutting-edge security measures

902
00:59:47,166 --> 00:59:49,335
will be countered
by her state-of-the-art gear

903
00:59:49,419 --> 00:59:51,504
and her nimble, acrobatic moves

904
00:59:51,588 --> 00:59:53,089
as she infiltrates the facility.

905
01:00:27,540 --> 01:00:31,127
The world's greatest spy
will bypass any security measures

906
01:00:31,210 --> 01:00:34,422
with her quick thinking and dexterity.

907
01:00:34,505 --> 01:00:36,841
Mission accomplished.

908
01:01:24,430 --> 01:01:25,431
Who's there?

909
01:01:41,197 --> 01:01:42,281
Get over here!

910
01:01:50,039 --> 01:01:51,082
Stop!

911
01:02:05,847 --> 01:02:06,848
SENDER: QUICK WEIGHT LOSS

912
01:02:40,339 --> 01:02:41,257
Hello?

913
01:02:47,930 --> 01:02:49,098
Dad?

914
01:02:53,728 --> 01:02:54,645
Joong-gan.

915
01:03:01,319 --> 01:03:02,195
Jun-hee.

916
01:03:06,199 --> 01:03:07,325
You'reâ€¦

917
01:03:09,035 --> 01:03:10,119
in Korea?

918
01:03:12,330 --> 01:03:14,665
All right!

919
01:03:51,619 --> 01:03:54,038
STRONG GIRL NAM-SOON

920
01:03:54,121 --> 01:03:55,665
We found nothing on Ryu Si-o's computer.

921
01:03:55,748 --> 01:03:57,500
Let's look into
the corporate relations team.

922
01:03:57,583 --> 01:03:58,709
What did you want to talk about?

923
01:03:58,793 --> 01:04:02,004
I just don't get it.
How the hell did you win him over?

924
01:04:02,088 --> 01:04:04,257
I'm done caring about what others think.

925
01:04:04,340 --> 01:04:06,384
I'll treat you even better, Joong-gan.

926
01:04:06,467 --> 01:04:07,593
What about Mom?

927
01:04:07,677 --> 01:04:09,053
She'll be known as a cheater.

928
01:04:09,136 --> 01:04:11,055
Is your dad coming to Korea?

929
01:04:11,138 --> 01:04:12,390
Answer me.

930
01:04:12,473 --> 01:04:14,225
I'm going to check out Heritage Club.

931
01:04:14,308 --> 01:04:16,352
There will be leads there as well.

932
01:04:16,435 --> 01:04:17,520
If you think you can beat me,

933
01:04:17,603 --> 01:04:18,563
give it a shot.

934
01:04:18,646 --> 01:04:20,356
You know Ryu Si-o, don't you?

935
01:04:20,439 --> 01:04:22,108
Where are they right now?

936
01:04:22,191 --> 01:04:24,110
I need you to kill someone.

937
01:04:25,027 --> 01:04:29,782
