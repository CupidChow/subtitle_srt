STRONG GIRL NAM-SOON

EPISODE 14
FOREWARNED BLOODBATH

4
00:01:26,628 --> 00:01:28,171
GEUMJU TV NEWS

5
00:01:30,381 --> 00:01:32,050
Hello, everyone.

6
00:01:42,644 --> 00:01:45,021
This is Jung Na-young at Geumju TV News.

7
00:01:45,104 --> 00:01:46,397
I'm Kim Gi-dae.

8
00:01:47,482 --> 00:01:49,400
Though Doogo's CEO, Ryu Si-o…

9
00:01:57,951 --> 00:02:00,328
has orchestrated the illegal distribution

10
00:02:00,411 --> 00:02:03,623
of the new synthetic drug CTA4885
disguised in puffer jackets,

11
00:02:03,706 --> 00:02:05,667
the Prosecutors' Office and police

12
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:07,919
still haven't released
any kind of statement.

13
00:02:08,503 --> 00:02:11,339
Meanwhile, members of Serakim,
one of Vietnam's top three drug cartels

14
00:02:11,422 --> 00:02:13,883
that made hundreds of millions of won
selling methamphetamine,

15
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:14,926
have been arrested

16
00:02:15,009 --> 00:02:16,928
following the tenacious investigation
of the Korean police.

17
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:22,100
So why hasn't there been an investigation

18
00:02:22,183 --> 00:02:24,602
into Korean drug lord Ryu Si-o
and those backing him?

19
00:02:24,686 --> 00:02:26,146
Doogo's CEO, Ryu Si-o,

20
00:02:26,229 --> 00:02:29,065
sought to cover up the facts
regarding CTA4885

21
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:32,610
by soliciting a hit on Hwang Geum-ju,
the CEO of Geumju TV.

22
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:35,113
And while she was hospitalized,

23
00:02:35,196 --> 00:02:37,407
he orchestrated
another attempt on her life.

24
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:41,369
And when Shin Gang-su,
one of his dealers, was arrested,

25
00:02:41,452 --> 00:02:44,289
he sent an impostor
posing as a lawyer to murder him

26
00:02:44,372 --> 00:02:46,916
in order to cover up his tracks.

27
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:53,590
Okay, let us begin.

28
00:02:57,552 --> 00:02:59,470
Hello, everyone.

29
00:03:11,774 --> 00:03:12,817
Pause filming.

30
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:15,862
Ms. Jung, come see me.

31
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:27,916
Have a seat.

32
00:03:34,213 --> 00:03:35,256
Na-young,

33
00:03:36,758 --> 00:03:37,884
what's going on?

34
00:03:39,135 --> 00:03:40,720
Tell me everything.

35
00:03:42,305 --> 00:03:43,348
Ms. Hwang.

36
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,736
Ryu Si-o

37
00:03:57,237 --> 00:04:00,323
is using my little sister in China
as leverage against me.

38
00:04:01,574 --> 00:04:03,201
If I don't do as he says,

39
00:04:03,284 --> 00:04:06,537
my sister will be framed
as a drug courier.

40
00:04:06,621 --> 00:04:09,374
Were you about to say
that our reports were lies

41
00:04:09,457 --> 00:04:10,708
out of fear for her safety?

42
00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:12,418
If that were my intention,

43
00:04:12,502 --> 00:04:14,921
I wouldn't be telling you this.

44
00:04:18,424 --> 00:04:19,801
I'm sorry, Na-young.

45
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:23,721
I'm sorry for putting you in this spot.

46
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:29,519
I'll make sure nothing happens
to you or your sister.

47
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:32,188
Let's postpone for about an hour.

48
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:44,158
It's me, Gentleman.

49
00:04:44,242 --> 00:04:45,868
There's something you need to do

50
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:47,078
right away.

51
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:52,709
The Prosecutors' Office and police,
who should be leading the war on drugs,

52
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:55,878
are working in collusion
with drug lords and dealers.

53
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:57,714
But such news is no longer surprising.

54
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:02,593
The initial critical window we had
to investigate CTA4885

55
00:05:02,677 --> 00:05:04,095
has now been closed.

56
00:05:04,929 --> 00:05:07,181
However, Geumju TV News will do its best

57
00:05:07,265 --> 00:05:10,643
to open a second window of opportunity.

58
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:11,936
Thank you.

59
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:23,656
Thank you.

60
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:24,782
Hello.

61
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:29,829
-Gosh.
-No way.

62
00:05:29,912 --> 00:05:31,164
Is this a house or a palace?

63
00:05:31,247 --> 00:05:32,749
How do you even clean this place?

64
00:05:42,967 --> 00:05:43,926
Hello.

65
00:05:46,054 --> 00:05:47,638
How can I help you?

66
00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:51,017
-Go ahead.
-Right.

67
00:05:51,517 --> 00:05:54,312
I met you at the party Ms. Hwang threw.

68
00:05:54,395 --> 00:05:55,438
Right.

69
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:57,815
It's been a while, Detective.

70
00:06:00,443 --> 00:06:02,987
Then you must all be detectives.

71
00:06:03,071 --> 00:06:04,781
-Right.
-That's right.

72
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:06,824
Would you like a cup of coffee?

73
00:06:08,951 --> 00:06:10,703
-That'd be nice.
-Sure.

74
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:11,829
Thank you.

75
00:06:22,673 --> 00:06:23,549
By the way,

76
00:06:23,633 --> 00:06:24,634
who are you?

77
00:06:24,717 --> 00:06:25,676
Me?

78
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:28,054
I am the man dating Ms. Gil Joong-gan,

79
00:06:29,138 --> 00:06:31,766
who is the mother of Ms. Hwang Geum-ju,

80
00:06:32,725 --> 00:06:35,269
who is the mother of Ms. Gang Nam-soon.

81
00:06:36,437 --> 00:06:37,438
What?

82
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:40,942
Then,

83
00:06:41,859 --> 00:06:43,820
where's Ms. Hwang?

84
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:45,404
I heard she left for work.

85
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:50,493
Then where's Ms. Gang Nam-soon?

86
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:51,994
I heard she and her brother

87
00:06:52,703 --> 00:06:54,580
were out looking for their father,

88
00:06:54,664 --> 00:06:57,291
Ms. Hwang's ex-husband.

89
00:06:59,752 --> 00:07:01,504
-I see.
-Then,

90
00:07:01,587 --> 00:07:03,548
where's Nam-soon's grandmother?

91
00:07:03,631 --> 00:07:05,174
My dear Joong-gan

92
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:07,593
carried her son Geum-dong to the hospital

93
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:09,011
after he collapsed.

94
00:07:09,637 --> 00:07:12,140
He collapsed yet again
just when he got home.

95
00:07:12,223 --> 00:07:14,809
So you're saying
no family member is present--

96
00:07:14,892 --> 00:07:17,061
Excuse me, where are the DIU detectives?

97
00:07:18,396 --> 00:07:19,439
Right, hello.

98
00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:21,065
Well,

99
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:24,610
Ms. Hwang told me
to take you to the underground vault.

100
00:07:25,403 --> 00:07:26,362
Who are you?

101
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:27,822
Who…

102
00:07:27,905 --> 00:07:30,283
I'm the managing director
at the pawnshop, Gold Blue.

103
00:07:30,366 --> 00:07:31,534
Come this way, please.

104
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:33,453
What brings you here?

105
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:37,707
It's funny how there are only guests here
and no family members.

106
00:07:38,249 --> 00:07:40,293
I'll leave you to it then.

107
00:07:40,376 --> 00:07:41,377
I have to go to work.

108
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:42,795
-Right.
-Sure.

109
00:07:43,421 --> 00:07:44,755
You're heading directly to work?

110
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:50,261
This way, please.

111
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:54,682
What on earth?

112
00:07:56,934 --> 00:07:59,061
Our office is nothing compared to this.

113
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:05,318
I'll leave you all to it.

114
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:09,155
And…

115
00:08:10,865 --> 00:08:13,868
please let me know if you need anything.

116
00:08:14,368 --> 00:08:15,203
My dream

117
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:17,455
was to be a police officer.

118
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:23,419
I'll leave you to it.

119
00:08:24,587 --> 00:08:26,214
I see he's quite the character.

120
00:08:26,297 --> 00:08:28,299
Check out the vault door.

121
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:29,884
Hello?

122
00:08:30,468 --> 00:08:32,136
You can work out of that place.

123
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:35,264
It is the most secure place
anyone can find.

124
00:08:36,224 --> 00:08:37,767
Ryu Si-o has already infiltrated

125
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:40,061
Gold Blue and Geumju Hotel.

126
00:08:40,144 --> 00:08:41,854
When will you go to Busan?

127
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:43,064
Tomorrow.

128
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:46,859
The sea hares will arrive in Busan Port
the day after tomorrow.

129
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:48,069
I see.

130
00:08:48,152 --> 00:08:50,363
I wish you luck on your mission.

131
00:08:52,323 --> 00:08:55,701
No one must know where you currently are.

132
00:08:56,619 --> 00:08:58,788
Not even Nam-soon.

133
00:08:58,871 --> 00:09:00,206
Right.

134
00:09:00,289 --> 00:09:01,499
But…

135
00:09:01,582 --> 00:09:04,126
the managing director of Gold Blue
just escorted us here.

136
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:05,211
Nam-gil?

137
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:07,380
Don't worry about him.

138
00:09:07,463 --> 00:09:10,007
He knows over 800 of my secrets.

139
00:09:10,091 --> 00:09:11,717
He's too scatterbrained

140
00:09:12,468 --> 00:09:13,469
to remember everything.

141
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:15,429
Anyway,

142
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:18,975
operate quietly from the vault

143
00:09:19,517 --> 00:09:20,476
as if you're ghosts.

144
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,061
All right, ma'am.

145
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:30,152
It's like the movie Parasite.

146
00:09:42,832 --> 00:09:44,500
Opulentia agents from the Chinese branch

147
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:46,502
have been stationed
at Jung Yun-jeong's residence.

148
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:53,968
Thank you so much, Ms. Hwang.

149
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:57,638
I won't hide in the shadows anymore.

150
00:09:57,722 --> 00:09:58,639
No.

151
00:09:59,515 --> 00:10:00,474
You must stay hidden.

152
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:03,185
Ryu Si-o's completely lost it.

153
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:04,979
He will come looking for you.

154
00:10:05,563 --> 00:10:07,315
Stay at my vacation home in Busan.

155
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:09,483
Rest up and recuperate.

156
00:10:10,192 --> 00:10:11,527
I have to go there myself anyway.

157
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:13,029
All right.

158
00:10:15,489 --> 00:10:17,158
Thank you, Ms. Hwang.

159
00:10:29,837 --> 00:10:30,838
Hello?

160
00:10:31,505 --> 00:10:32,882
Ms. Hwang, it's bad.

161
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:33,841
Gang Bong-go…

162
00:10:33,924 --> 00:10:35,676
I mean, your ex-husband--

163
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:36,927
What now?

164
00:11:00,451 --> 00:11:01,577
Two.

165
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:04,664
Five.

166
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,054
Please have some water too.

167
00:11:20,554 --> 00:11:23,724
Having bodyguards doesn't mean
he has 12 lives to spare.

168
00:11:24,558 --> 00:11:25,393
Put him on.

169
00:11:26,143 --> 00:11:27,728
Ms. Hwang is on the phone.

170
00:11:27,812 --> 00:11:28,813
Right.

171
00:11:30,648 --> 00:11:32,483
-What is it?
-You.

172
00:11:32,566 --> 00:11:34,985
I told you to sit tight with Nam-in.

173
00:11:35,069 --> 00:11:37,738
What's so hard about doing nothing?

174
00:11:37,822 --> 00:11:40,699
You've been at death's door
and you still don't get it?

175
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:43,285
Why are you exercising
under the moonlight?

176
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:45,246
I'm not just exercising.
I'm weight training.

177
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,332
I have it in me to protect myself.

178
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:49,625
I'm a man, you know.

179
00:11:49,708 --> 00:11:50,918
You're so full of it.

180
00:11:51,001 --> 00:11:53,087
Out of all the times you had to…

181
00:11:57,425 --> 00:11:58,843
We're going to Busan tomorrow,

182
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:01,512
so wrap it up and head home.

183
00:12:01,595 --> 00:12:02,638
Busan?

184
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:04,223
That's out of the blue.

185
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:10,396
She always orders me around

186
00:12:10,479 --> 00:12:12,064
as if she thinks I'm still hers.

187
00:12:12,148 --> 00:12:14,066
Then she should be mine for a change.

188
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,448
You should all head home.

189
00:12:26,162 --> 00:12:27,288
Dad.

190
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:32,042
So this is where you were?

191
00:12:32,543 --> 00:12:33,836
We've been looking for you.

192
00:12:34,503 --> 00:12:35,588
Why?

193
00:12:35,671 --> 00:12:37,673
-What's wrong, Nam-in?
-I'm exhausted.

194
00:12:39,133 --> 00:12:40,301
Are you all right?

195
00:12:47,683 --> 00:12:49,518
Sir, Jung Na-young at Geumju TV--

196
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:50,686
I know.

197
00:12:51,854 --> 00:12:53,230
I should've killed her.

198
00:12:55,858 --> 00:12:57,610
I should've just ended them.

199
00:12:59,236 --> 00:13:00,321
Both Jung Na-young…

200
00:13:03,657 --> 00:13:04,658
and Gang Nam-soon.

201
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:10,998
I get it now.

202
00:13:14,668 --> 00:13:16,086
I finally understand

203
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:19,507
why Pavel executes traitors
without giving them second chances.

204
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:22,468
You're dismissed.

205
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:31,185
Hi, I'm Tsetseg.

206
00:13:31,268 --> 00:13:32,520
I'm mesmerized.

207
00:13:32,603 --> 00:13:33,729
Should I cry instead?

208
00:13:35,731 --> 00:13:37,024
Your turn, Si-o!

209
00:13:37,107 --> 00:13:40,110
-So I ate it to replenish my energy
-So I ate it to replenish my energy

210
00:13:40,194 --> 00:13:41,612
Well done, great job

211
00:13:41,695 --> 00:13:44,657
To marry a Korean man.

212
00:13:45,866 --> 00:13:47,243
I've always been speedy.

213
00:13:48,744 --> 00:13:50,663
Lamb chops.

214
00:13:52,081 --> 00:13:56,085
You're a light that's not sure
if it's real or fake

215
00:13:56,168 --> 00:13:58,671
but could be real if it tries hard enough.

216
00:13:58,754 --> 00:13:59,672
Would you like

217
00:14:00,589 --> 00:14:01,423
to go out with me?

218
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:02,967
Go out with you?

219
00:14:05,135 --> 00:14:06,428
Can I…

220
00:14:07,137 --> 00:14:08,222
fully trust you?

221
00:14:10,057 --> 00:14:11,600
You can trust me, Si-o.

222
00:14:14,603 --> 00:14:17,022
I wonder why she did such a thing.

223
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:18,983
I apologize for stealing.

224
00:14:19,066 --> 00:14:22,486
I wanted to give them
to my parents in Mongolia.

225
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:26,115
Hello.

226
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:27,950
I'm Hwang Geum-ju.

227
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:29,535
I'm Hillary.

228
00:14:29,618 --> 00:14:31,328
It's a pleasure to meet you.

229
00:14:57,062 --> 00:14:59,398
Mr. Ryu, the company
is crawling with reporters.

230
00:14:59,481 --> 00:15:01,817
-Gather them at the warehouse.
-Sorry?

231
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:04,486
Since they're all working so hard,
I'll cooperate.

232
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:08,240
The cardinal rule of journalism
is to speak the truth.

233
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:11,535
Tell them I'll show them how it's done.

234
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:30,804
What the…

235
00:15:33,557 --> 00:15:34,600
Mom!

236
00:15:49,365 --> 00:15:50,491
Mom,

237
00:15:50,574 --> 00:15:52,743
we can easily do this ourselves,

238
00:15:52,826 --> 00:15:54,578
so why are we taking the whole family?

239
00:15:57,957 --> 00:15:59,375
It's dangerous,

240
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:01,961
and the family must be within my reach.

241
00:16:03,295 --> 00:16:04,630
See for yourself.

242
00:16:05,172 --> 00:16:07,174
Do you think they can fend for themselves?

243
00:16:19,395 --> 00:16:20,980
You're right. They should come.

244
00:16:24,024 --> 00:16:26,902
Let Inspector Kang and the DIU
handle things here.

245
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:28,237
They'll do a good job.

246
00:16:28,862 --> 00:16:32,032
Let's spend some quality time together
while we're there.

247
00:16:32,533 --> 00:16:35,077
We've never been on a family trip
since you came back to us.

248
00:16:35,577 --> 00:16:36,412
I'd like that.

249
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:37,329
All right.

250
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:41,250
We'll leave for the airport in 30 minutes.

251
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:43,377
We're taking a plane?

252
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:44,336
Nice.

253
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:46,046
Leave it to me if it malfunctions.

254
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:47,006
If it malfunctions?

255
00:16:48,716 --> 00:16:51,093
-Can't we take a car?
-Nam-in.

256
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:53,804
Time is most valuable to entrepreneurs.

257
00:16:53,887 --> 00:16:55,055
Time is gold.

258
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:56,432
To run a café,

259
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:58,517
you must know the importance
of opportunity cost.

260
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:01,311
You all think nothing of it
because you're thin.

261
00:17:01,395 --> 00:17:02,229
But me?

262
00:17:02,813 --> 00:17:05,315
I'm terrified the plane will crash
whenever I board one.

263
00:17:05,399 --> 00:17:07,526
I'm worried I'm too heavy for it.

264
00:17:07,609 --> 00:17:10,195
You think a car would do a better job
when a plane failed?

265
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:12,990
Cars run on roads
while planes are in the sky.

266
00:17:13,073 --> 00:17:14,116
I see.

267
00:17:14,616 --> 00:17:16,660
I overlooked that, my nephew.

268
00:17:16,744 --> 00:17:18,996
Take the plane on your own.
That'll settle things.

269
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:21,123
Do you think
I'll be able to do so on my own?

270
00:17:22,249 --> 00:17:23,917
What about my luggage?
Who'll keep me standing?

271
00:17:24,001 --> 00:17:25,294
I see.

272
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:27,129
I overlooked that, Uncle.

273
00:17:27,212 --> 00:17:28,464
Quiet!

274
00:17:33,427 --> 00:17:34,720
I'm not going.

275
00:17:34,803 --> 00:17:36,013
Go by yourselves.

276
00:17:36,096 --> 00:17:37,139
-Why not?
-Why not?

277
00:17:37,222 --> 00:17:38,640
I need to end things with your dad.

278
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:40,934
Are you really going to
kick Dad to the curb

279
00:17:41,018 --> 00:17:42,311
and live with that guy?

280
00:17:42,394 --> 00:17:45,105
-Of course.
-Why would you abandon our poor dad?

281
00:17:45,189 --> 00:17:46,565
You feel bad for your dad?

282
00:17:46,648 --> 00:17:50,069
Why would you invite
a stranger into our home?

283
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:52,362
Strangers? Those men were police officers.

284
00:17:52,863 --> 00:17:54,073
They only came by for a visit.

285
00:17:54,156 --> 00:17:55,157
The police?

286
00:17:55,824 --> 00:17:57,076
The guy's a barista.

287
00:17:57,159 --> 00:17:58,368
Hey.

288
00:17:59,203 --> 00:18:02,289
You saw how my strength was intact
even after beating your dad up.

289
00:18:02,372 --> 00:18:04,583
-Yes.
-If my powers are used for a wrong deed,

290
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:05,584
they'll disappear.

291
00:18:05,667 --> 00:18:07,169
That's how it works in this family.

292
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:09,129
So what does that imply?

293
00:18:09,213 --> 00:18:13,133
It means that what your dad did
is unforgivable, got it?

294
00:18:13,217 --> 00:18:17,471
That man does nothing but lie.

295
00:18:17,554 --> 00:18:19,515
Let's say he did leave to find Nam-soon.

296
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:20,974
He still could've called.

297
00:18:21,058 --> 00:18:23,352
Are there no phones in Tibet?

298
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:25,813
There's bad reception
due to the high altitude.

299
00:18:25,896 --> 00:18:27,022
You be quiet.

300
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:29,358
Nothing can justify his wrongdoings.

301
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:32,027
-I was just trying to be helpful.
-Forget it.

302
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:35,572
I'm going to hire a lawyer

303
00:18:36,406 --> 00:18:38,575
-and file for divorce.
-Mom.

304
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:39,618
-Mom.
-What?

305
00:18:39,701 --> 00:18:40,994
If you live with that man,

306
00:18:41,078 --> 00:18:42,121
I won't see you anymore.

307
00:18:42,204 --> 00:18:45,290
Geum-ju, this isn't the time
to stay neutral,

308
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:47,000
so make your position clear.

309
00:18:47,084 --> 00:18:48,085
Is that so?

310
00:18:48,168 --> 00:18:49,336
Geum-dong,

311
00:18:49,419 --> 00:18:51,630
go live with your dad then.

312
00:18:51,713 --> 00:18:53,507
There. Satisfied?

313
00:18:54,091 --> 00:18:55,759
-I won't go on this trip.
-Fine.

314
00:18:55,843 --> 00:18:57,761
-I'll go to the hospital.
-Do it.

315
00:18:57,845 --> 00:18:58,762
Our poor dad.

316
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:01,181
I'll take care of him.

317
00:19:03,267 --> 00:19:05,310
If you only knew just how much he pees.

318
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:08,021
He has poor circulation.

319
00:19:08,105 --> 00:19:09,189
Goodness.

320
00:19:09,773 --> 00:19:10,983
I like Dad more.

321
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:15,279
Just like you love that man
more than you love Dad!

322
00:19:15,904 --> 00:19:17,322
My head hurts.

323
00:19:17,406 --> 00:19:18,490
I know what you mean.

324
00:19:19,575 --> 00:19:21,201
-Jeez.
-Hello?

325
00:19:22,452 --> 00:19:23,996
-What?
-Goodness.

326
00:19:24,538 --> 00:19:25,664
The Prosecutors' Office?

327
00:19:26,206 --> 00:19:27,166
A search and seizure?

328
00:19:28,542 --> 00:19:30,043
That's for the better.

329
00:19:30,127 --> 00:19:32,921
That will only provoke public sentiment.

330
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:35,424
Serve it up with a cherry on top.

331
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:37,426
What? Oh, right.

332
00:19:37,509 --> 00:19:39,136
-Confiscate everything.
-Yes.

333
00:19:39,219 --> 00:19:40,345
-I'll do that.
-Yes, sir.

334
00:19:40,929 --> 00:19:42,681
Of course, Ms. Hwang.

335
00:19:42,764 --> 00:19:44,433
Got it. Will do.

336
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:45,934
-Don't move.
-Excuse me.

337
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:47,436
She says you're welcome
to take everything.

338
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:49,521
Geumju TV, Geumju Hotel,
and Geumju Hospital

339
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:50,981
will also cooperate.

340
00:19:51,064 --> 00:19:52,191
Ms. Hwang's orders.

341
00:19:52,274 --> 00:19:53,901
I'll neatly wrap these up for you

342
00:19:53,984 --> 00:19:55,569
and serve you a meal if necessary.

343
00:19:55,652 --> 00:19:56,695
Are you hungry?

344
00:19:56,778 --> 00:19:58,155
I know a clay pot stew place.

345
00:19:58,238 --> 00:20:00,282
Would you like something spicy or salty?

346
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:03,285
Guys, help them out.
Place everything in their boxes neatly.

347
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:04,745
You, load these up.

348
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:39,488
The puffer jacket they showed
on that pirate news station…

349
00:20:40,656 --> 00:20:41,573
is this.

350
00:20:55,337 --> 00:20:56,755
They said water

351
00:20:57,339 --> 00:20:58,507
would turn this into a drug.

352
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:18,443
Do you intend to demonstrate this
on every puffer jacket

353
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:19,569
that Doogo distributes?

354
00:21:19,653 --> 00:21:21,488
All of our puffer jackets

355
00:21:21,571 --> 00:21:25,951
have been recalled to be submitted
to the Prosecutors' Office.

356
00:21:26,034 --> 00:21:28,453
I don't distribute drugs.

357
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:33,709
Everything said about me
on Geumju TV is a lie.

358
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:36,795
Allegations of murder attempts
and the murder of Mr. Shin Gang-su

359
00:21:38,005 --> 00:21:39,339
are all works of fiction.

360
00:21:39,423 --> 00:21:42,217
Then why did Geumju TV
launch an attack on you?

361
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:44,469
I know what she's after.

362
00:21:44,553 --> 00:21:48,890
She asked to be Doogo's financier.

363
00:21:49,516 --> 00:21:50,851
I turned her down, of course.

364
00:21:51,852 --> 00:21:53,395
She is doing this in retaliation.

365
00:21:57,399 --> 00:21:58,400
Hwang Geum-ju.

366
00:22:00,277 --> 00:22:01,945
She is the axis of evil.

367
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:08,952
A plane ride would've been faster.

368
00:22:09,578 --> 00:22:12,122
We missed our flight
because you dragged your feet.

369
00:22:14,499 --> 00:22:16,668
Mom, will Grandma be all right on her own?

370
00:22:16,752 --> 00:22:19,004
Your grandma will only give us a headache.

371
00:22:19,087 --> 00:22:21,923
Someone tried to abduct her.
What if they retaliate?

372
00:22:22,007 --> 00:22:24,301
She's been abducted
more than once, you know.

373
00:22:24,384 --> 00:22:27,304
It's happened often since the day
of the legendary fight of Majang-dong.

374
00:22:27,888 --> 00:22:28,847
I'm worried.

375
00:22:28,930 --> 00:22:30,557
I know. You're just as worried.

376
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,976
Yes, I'm worried

377
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:34,394
about my dad.

378
00:22:35,604 --> 00:22:36,605
Our dad?

379
00:22:46,865 --> 00:22:50,494
That old hag is a killer.

380
00:22:51,661 --> 00:22:52,871
It hurts.

381
00:22:52,954 --> 00:22:54,414
It really hurts.

382
00:23:10,555 --> 00:23:11,473
Hello?

383
00:23:11,556 --> 00:23:13,600
Gan I-sik, I'm on my way to Busan.

384
00:23:15,227 --> 00:23:16,770
I need to ask a favor.

385
00:23:18,647 --> 00:23:19,564
Air that video.

386
00:23:20,482 --> 00:23:22,651
I understand you're worried about me.

387
00:23:22,734 --> 00:23:23,860
But…

388
00:23:24,736 --> 00:23:27,280
solving this case
means more to me right now.

389
00:23:28,824 --> 00:23:30,408
My brother, my mom,

390
00:23:31,201 --> 00:23:32,285
and my grandmother.

391
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:36,456
Everyone in my family nearly died.

392
00:23:37,374 --> 00:23:41,336
Even your team leader passed away
while investigating this drug.

393
00:23:42,838 --> 00:23:43,755
Gan I-sik,

394
00:23:44,422 --> 00:23:45,841
I need you to do this.

395
00:23:47,092 --> 00:23:48,093
Please.

396
00:23:57,853 --> 00:24:01,356
Why haven't the police arrested me yet?

397
00:24:02,774 --> 00:24:03,984
Hwang Geum-ju.

398
00:24:04,693 --> 00:24:08,238
She clearly made an allegation
that I tried to kill her.

399
00:24:10,532 --> 00:24:11,950
So why haven't I been arrested?

400
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:14,661
Wait.

401
00:24:14,744 --> 00:24:16,496
Could I…

402
00:24:17,247 --> 00:24:19,457
have something she needs?

403
00:24:23,753 --> 00:24:25,839
What could she need from you?

404
00:24:26,381 --> 00:24:29,217
Ryu Si-o's crimes haven't been proven yet.

405
00:24:29,301 --> 00:24:31,178
That must be why
they haven't taken you in.

406
00:24:31,261 --> 00:24:32,512
You.

407
00:24:32,596 --> 00:24:34,598
You almost got away with a billion won.

408
00:24:35,515 --> 00:24:36,975
So why did you come back?

409
00:24:38,435 --> 00:24:41,104
Why did you

410
00:24:42,355 --> 00:24:43,773
come back to me?

411
00:24:45,859 --> 00:24:47,652
I looked into it,

412
00:24:47,736 --> 00:24:50,197
and Hwang Geum-ju owns that café.

413
00:24:51,031 --> 00:24:52,073
Really?

414
00:24:53,909 --> 00:24:55,368
I had no idea.

415
00:24:58,663 --> 00:24:59,497
You.

416
00:25:00,916 --> 00:25:02,459
Tell me the truth…

417
00:25:17,682 --> 00:25:18,767
You drunkard.

418
00:25:37,494 --> 00:25:39,871
I've sent the list of VIP clients.

419
00:25:39,955 --> 00:25:40,872
I got it.

420
00:25:53,051 --> 00:25:54,803
Coming through.

421
00:25:55,428 --> 00:25:56,304
Mr. Yoon,

422
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:58,014
did Tsetseg come in to work today?

423
00:25:58,098 --> 00:25:59,599
That's your purview, not mine.

424
00:26:02,477 --> 00:26:03,687
You see…

425
00:26:04,271 --> 00:26:06,273
Mr. Ryu, it's about Tsetseg.

426
00:26:06,356 --> 00:26:07,524
According to Mr. Yang,

427
00:26:07,607 --> 00:26:09,693
she made a suspicious call
in the stairwell.

428
00:26:12,028 --> 00:26:13,113
She isn't Tsetseg.

429
00:26:16,199 --> 00:26:17,742
Tsetseg is Gang Nam-soon.

430
00:26:17,826 --> 00:26:18,743
Sorry?

431
00:26:21,788 --> 00:26:23,748
We looked into all her businesses

432
00:26:24,374 --> 00:26:25,417
but came up empty.

433
00:26:26,042 --> 00:26:28,003
The commissioner
of the National Tax Service

434
00:26:28,086 --> 00:26:29,713
thanks her annually
for being a model taxpayer,

435
00:26:29,796 --> 00:26:31,589
and she's received
four presidential commendations.

436
00:26:31,673 --> 00:26:33,717
I believe we underestimated her integrity.

437
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:36,219
I wondered who she was banking on
to act so rashly.

438
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,138
She just knew we'd find no dirt on her.

439
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:41,016
DEPUTY CHIEF PROSECUTOR MOON SEONG-U

440
00:26:41,641 --> 00:26:43,727
TBO's Director Jung is on the line.

441
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:45,061
Should I patch him through?

442
00:26:46,062 --> 00:26:46,896
Go ahead.

443
00:26:50,734 --> 00:26:52,068
This is Moon Seong-u.

444
00:27:01,995 --> 00:27:03,163
I appreciate…

445
00:27:03,955 --> 00:27:04,789
the offer.

446
00:27:04,873 --> 00:27:06,624
This is a dangerous task.

447
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:08,501
You could be arrested,

448
00:27:08,585 --> 00:27:11,504
put on a wanted list, or interrogated.

449
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:13,298
Are you still up for it?

450
00:27:15,717 --> 00:27:16,760
Of course.

451
00:27:17,469 --> 00:27:18,845
None of that matters.

452
00:27:20,305 --> 00:27:21,181
Let's do this.

453
00:27:22,349 --> 00:27:24,100
Let justice prevail in Korea.

454
00:27:26,394 --> 00:27:30,190
First trial of criminal case
number 2023-123.

455
00:27:30,273 --> 00:27:31,441
Defendant, Mr. Han Jeong-sik.

456
00:27:31,524 --> 00:27:33,276
I will announce the ruling.

457
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:35,070
Please rise from your seat.

458
00:27:38,031 --> 00:27:39,157
The sentence is as follows.

459
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:41,493
I sentence the defendant Mr. Han Jeong-sik

460
00:27:41,576 --> 00:27:43,828
-to three years--
-Who

461
00:27:44,371 --> 00:27:46,373
Is the criminal?

462
00:27:47,707 --> 00:27:48,833
Order.

463
00:27:51,294 --> 00:27:53,588
As a citizen
of Korea's democratic society,

464
00:27:53,671 --> 00:27:57,467
I would like for us to reclaim
the lost title of a drug-free nation.

465
00:27:58,927 --> 00:28:00,178
JUDGE HWANG, WAS THE BRIBE WORTH IT?
RYU SI-O'S SHIELD

466
00:28:00,261 --> 00:28:02,055
NO. 1 CORRUPT JUDGE
BRIBES ARE THE BEST!

467
00:28:05,433 --> 00:28:06,601
IT FEELS GREAT TO ABUSE THE LAW!
IT'S SO EASY!

468
00:28:08,561 --> 00:28:09,604
That little…

469
00:28:09,687 --> 00:28:10,647
Get him out of here!

470
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:13,274
To think that a judge
of this honorable court

471
00:28:13,358 --> 00:28:15,443
has been at the heart of a drug ring.

472
00:28:16,653 --> 00:28:19,197
So who is the real criminal?

473
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:21,783
I dare you to ask your gavel!

474
00:28:21,866 --> 00:28:23,243
Get him out of here!

475
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:27,080
Let go!

476
00:28:27,163 --> 00:28:29,207
Let go of me!

477
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:30,667
I…

478
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:34,337
I still have 12 more banners by my side!

479
00:28:34,421 --> 00:28:37,006
Wait, that hurts.

480
00:28:39,884 --> 00:28:42,846
Hello, everyone. This is Jung Ba-hun.

481
00:28:42,929 --> 00:28:46,808
Today, we will be talking
to Deputy Chief Prosecutor Moon Seong-u

482
00:28:46,891 --> 00:28:49,519
of the Seoul Central District
Prosecutors' Office,

483
00:28:49,602 --> 00:28:51,354
who has been leading the war on drugs.

484
00:28:51,438 --> 00:28:52,480
Welcome.

485
00:28:52,564 --> 00:28:53,898
CURRENT AFFAIRS TO MY EARS

486
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:04,576
POST-PRODUCTION STUDIO

487
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:07,954
Relax, guys.

488
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:11,374
There is controversy

489
00:29:12,041 --> 00:29:13,710
surrounding the rumors about a drug

490
00:29:13,793 --> 00:29:15,712
-that is undetectable.
-Stay calm.

491
00:29:15,795 --> 00:29:18,381
Prosecutor Moon, are you aware of this?

492
00:29:22,135 --> 00:29:24,846
The basic rule with drugs is

493
00:29:24,929 --> 00:29:27,974
that they can be detected once consumed.

494
00:29:29,851 --> 00:29:31,394
I'm willing to bet

495
00:29:31,478 --> 00:29:33,354
my entire professional career

496
00:29:33,438 --> 00:29:34,814
on there being no such drugs.

497
00:29:38,401 --> 00:29:41,237
What I believed to be weight-loss pills
turned out to be drugs.

498
00:29:42,238 --> 00:29:44,657
The drug wasn't detected in her autopsy,

499
00:29:45,408 --> 00:29:47,994
but I was told
she had to drink an antidote.

500
00:29:49,037 --> 00:29:52,081
-Zoom in.
-But it was too expensive to buy.

501
00:29:53,875 --> 00:29:55,752
The rich are our targets

502
00:29:55,835 --> 00:29:58,213
since they can afford the antidote.

503
00:29:58,296 --> 00:29:59,547
What I know for sure

504
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:02,592
is that Doogo controls
the antidote business.

505
00:30:02,675 --> 00:30:05,428
I tended to about 100 clients.

506
00:30:05,512 --> 00:30:10,391
There are a lot of distributors
across the nation working for Madam Kim.

507
00:30:10,475 --> 00:30:11,434
-Are you saying
-What the hell?

508
00:30:11,518 --> 00:30:13,019
the pills are distributed
all over the country?

509
00:30:13,102 --> 00:30:14,938
Who the hell are you?

510
00:30:15,021 --> 00:30:15,980
-Not so fast.
-Hey!

511
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:17,190
Stop!

512
00:30:48,137 --> 00:30:48,972
Hey, Nam-gil.

513
00:30:49,055 --> 00:30:50,223
Ms. Hwang,

514
00:30:50,306 --> 00:30:52,600
it's blowing up. Check the Internet.

515
00:30:52,684 --> 00:30:54,978
DOOGO, DOOGO DRUGS,
DOOGO ANTIDOTE, DOOGO RESEARCH LAB

516
00:30:57,188 --> 00:30:58,273
Nam-soon.

517
00:31:03,862 --> 00:31:06,823
All we need to know
is how the sea hares are imported.

518
00:31:07,532 --> 00:31:10,451
I just so happen to know
the shipping company that imports them.

519
00:31:11,286 --> 00:31:13,746
As you know, I'm a businesswoman.

520
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:15,999
Mom, you're the coolest.

521
00:31:16,624 --> 00:31:17,458
I agree.

522
00:31:22,297 --> 00:31:23,339
Let's head inside.

523
00:31:37,854 --> 00:31:38,813
It's so nice.

524
00:31:40,273 --> 00:31:41,316
Tsetseg.

525
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:54,787
Mom?

526
00:32:01,085 --> 00:32:03,129
-Mom.
-It's been so long.

527
00:32:09,844 --> 00:32:11,971
Have you been well?

528
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:15,725
Where's Dad?

529
00:32:15,808 --> 00:32:17,226
I came alone.

530
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:18,853
His heart isn't doing well lately,

531
00:32:19,562 --> 00:32:21,856
so the doctor told him not to fly.

532
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:26,110
We don't want him to collapse
from the excitement of seeing you.

533
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:29,864
We'll video chat with him later.

534
00:32:40,458 --> 00:32:41,918
She's my mother.

535
00:32:43,127 --> 00:32:44,003
Hello.

536
00:32:44,587 --> 00:32:45,505
Hello.

537
00:32:48,758 --> 00:32:50,051
This is my dad.

538
00:32:50,677 --> 00:32:51,886
Hello.

539
00:32:53,054 --> 00:32:54,263
This is my younger brother Nam-in.

540
00:32:55,139 --> 00:32:56,099
Hello.

541
00:32:57,141 --> 00:32:59,602
This is my uncle, Hwang Geum-dong.

542
00:32:59,686 --> 00:33:00,770
Hello.

543
00:33:03,356 --> 00:33:04,732
They're my family.

544
00:33:41,185 --> 00:33:42,603
-Please enjoy.
-Yes.

545
00:33:42,687 --> 00:33:43,604
Please enjoy.

546
00:33:43,688 --> 00:33:44,981
Yes.

547
00:33:46,357 --> 00:33:48,860
DAD

548
00:33:48,943 --> 00:33:51,237
Mom, I have a boyfriend.

549
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:52,155
A boyfriend?

550
00:33:52,238 --> 00:33:53,698
He's a total babe!

551
00:33:54,615 --> 00:33:55,491
Is that so?

552
00:33:56,743 --> 00:33:57,744
Check him out.

553
00:34:00,663 --> 00:34:02,373
He's radiant like the summer sun.

554
00:34:02,457 --> 00:34:03,791
He's handsome in every way.

555
00:34:04,667 --> 00:34:06,169
Even down to his eyelashes.

556
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:09,797
Does that mean
I'll have a grandchild soon?

557
00:34:12,383 --> 00:34:13,801
Nam-soon, come here.

558
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:16,095
What…

559
00:34:31,611 --> 00:34:34,530
Stop! We're not the bad guys!

560
00:34:34,614 --> 00:34:35,615
Wait!

561
00:34:37,825 --> 00:34:40,286
Do you have Gang Nam-soon's location?

562
00:34:40,953 --> 00:34:43,414
After the news broadcast,
she fell off the grid.

563
00:34:43,498 --> 00:34:44,832
She must be using a jammer

564
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:46,125
because I can't track her.

565
00:34:47,043 --> 00:34:48,669
But she seems to be out of Seoul.

566
00:34:53,174 --> 00:34:54,258
I'll…

567
00:34:56,177 --> 00:34:57,303
kill them all.

568
00:35:12,193 --> 00:35:13,820
My daughter, that was amazing.

569
00:35:14,362 --> 00:35:15,238
Good.

570
00:35:20,827 --> 00:35:22,578
I'll enjoy the meal.

571
00:35:24,956 --> 00:35:26,332
My goodness.

572
00:35:35,967 --> 00:35:37,385
Good morning, my daughter.

573
00:35:37,468 --> 00:35:38,803
Gan I-sik isn't picking up.

574
00:35:38,886 --> 00:35:39,720
I'm worried.

575
00:35:41,514 --> 00:35:43,057
He was arrested

576
00:35:43,724 --> 00:35:45,518
and is in a holding cell.

577
00:35:46,185 --> 00:35:47,854
A cop in a holding cell?

578
00:35:47,937 --> 00:35:49,897
CELL 2

579
00:35:52,066 --> 00:35:53,860
So this is what it feels like.

580
00:35:53,943 --> 00:35:55,945
Get me the Bible or Buddhist scriptures

581
00:35:56,028 --> 00:35:57,905
-so that I can train my mind.
-Or cards.

582
00:35:57,989 --> 00:35:59,574
Let us at least have some fun.

583
00:35:59,657 --> 00:36:00,658
Or give us a phone

584
00:36:00,741 --> 00:36:02,618
so I can tell my mom I'm not coming home.

585
00:36:03,828 --> 00:36:05,037
Maybe I can slide out.

586
00:36:05,746 --> 00:36:08,124
Nam-gil went into hiding

587
00:36:08,207 --> 00:36:11,169
and is enjoying his time
at my vacation house in Gangneung.

588
00:36:12,295 --> 00:36:13,963
But Hee-sik's got guts,

589
00:36:14,714 --> 00:36:17,341
which makes him
the perfect suitor for my daughter.

590
00:36:19,802 --> 00:36:20,887
I'm worried.

591
00:36:21,637 --> 00:36:22,680
Nothing bad will happen, right?

592
00:36:23,764 --> 00:36:25,892
Don't worry. It'll all be fine.

593
00:36:27,268 --> 00:36:29,604
Zolzaya wanted to explore Busan.

594
00:36:29,687 --> 00:36:31,063
You should go with her.

595
00:36:31,647 --> 00:36:33,441
I'll be running errands.

596
00:36:33,983 --> 00:36:34,984
Okay.

597
00:36:36,277 --> 00:36:37,737
Thanks, Mom.

598
00:36:39,947 --> 00:36:43,075
Ma'am, we reached an agreement
with the ship's captain.

599
00:36:43,159 --> 00:36:44,452
We have the goods on video.

600
00:36:44,535 --> 00:36:47,455
They'll be at a fish hatchery in Busan
before being shipped to Seoul.

601
00:36:47,538 --> 00:36:50,124
What's the quantity?

602
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:51,709
About two tons of it at a time.

603
00:36:51,792 --> 00:36:54,045
Text me the address of that fish hatchery.

604
00:36:54,587 --> 00:36:55,796
I'll head there myself.

605
00:36:56,422 --> 00:36:57,340
Goodbye.

606
00:37:15,733 --> 00:37:16,817
Mr. Bread?

607
00:37:19,654 --> 00:37:20,696
Ms. Hwang?

608
00:37:30,998 --> 00:37:31,874
So tell me.

609
00:37:32,458 --> 00:37:33,668
Why are you in Busan?

610
00:37:33,751 --> 00:37:35,544
I could ask you the same thing.

611
00:37:35,628 --> 00:37:36,754
Why are you here?

612
00:37:36,837 --> 00:37:38,339
Busan is my hometown.

613
00:37:38,422 --> 00:37:40,716
What? I heard you were from Wall Street.

614
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,134
Of course that's a lie.

615
00:37:42,218 --> 00:37:44,804
What? Unbelievable.

616
00:37:44,887 --> 00:37:46,722
Did you just admit to being a fraud?

617
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:48,808
Fine then.

618
00:37:48,891 --> 00:37:51,644
So who the hell are you really?

619
00:37:51,727 --> 00:37:54,772
I believe I've asked you this
about 30 times.

620
00:37:59,318 --> 00:38:00,152
To be honest,

621
00:38:01,612 --> 00:38:02,571
I grew up an orphan.

622
00:38:03,281 --> 00:38:04,865
I was born in Busan,

623
00:38:04,949 --> 00:38:07,868
but I went to Russia while working
on an anchovy fishing boat.

624
00:38:07,952 --> 00:38:09,704
An anchovy fishing boat?

625
00:38:09,787 --> 00:38:10,788
That's right.

626
00:38:11,622 --> 00:38:12,957
An anchovy fishing boat.

627
00:38:13,666 --> 00:38:15,626
I was kicked out of the orphanage at 14

628
00:38:16,252 --> 00:38:18,587
before aging out of the system at 18.

629
00:38:19,171 --> 00:38:21,841
Truth be told,
I haven't even been to the US.

630
00:38:21,924 --> 00:38:23,175
Right.

631
00:38:23,759 --> 00:38:25,344
No wonder.

632
00:38:25,428 --> 00:38:26,721
In Russia,

633
00:38:27,805 --> 00:38:30,141
I had Choco Pies for every single meal.

634
00:38:30,224 --> 00:38:33,311
It was when Choco Pies
first came into Russia.

635
00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:37,315
The Russians went crazy for them,

636
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:39,859
so I went around selling them.

637
00:38:39,942 --> 00:38:41,986
The anchovy fishing boat
became a Choco Pie boat,

638
00:38:42,778 --> 00:38:44,447
and I finally started making some money.

639
00:38:45,281 --> 00:38:47,366
By then, I became known…

640
00:38:48,534 --> 00:38:49,744
as Choco Song.

641
00:38:50,453 --> 00:38:51,287
Whatever.

642
00:38:52,663 --> 00:38:53,622
What about the photo?

643
00:38:54,290 --> 00:38:55,791
Explain that photo.

644
00:38:55,875 --> 00:38:57,710
The one you tore up.

645
00:38:58,294 --> 00:39:00,004
The one with you and Ryu Si-o.

646
00:39:00,087 --> 00:39:01,172
Right.

647
00:39:04,508 --> 00:39:05,509
That one.

648
00:39:07,136 --> 00:39:08,471
It's my humiliating past.

649
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:13,601
An anchovy fishing boat was used
to bring Choco Pies overseas.

650
00:39:14,185 --> 00:39:15,353
I smuggled them in.

651
00:39:15,436 --> 00:39:16,437
Smuggling?

652
00:39:17,396 --> 00:39:18,272
Choco Pies?

653
00:39:18,356 --> 00:39:20,608
And the Russian police
busted the operation.

654
00:39:22,234 --> 00:39:24,779
So I took the Choco Pies
that weren't confiscated

655
00:39:25,488 --> 00:39:27,114
and sold them
while traveling all over Russia.

656
00:39:27,823 --> 00:39:31,660
I traveled between Kazan, Ufa,
Omsk, Perm, and Moscow.

657
00:39:32,912 --> 00:39:35,247
Choco Pie

658
00:39:37,416 --> 00:39:40,002
That's a photo of me
during my shabby days as a peddler.

659
00:39:41,837 --> 00:39:43,756
When you stuck that photo under my nose,

660
00:39:45,091 --> 00:39:47,760
it reminded me of my days as Choco Song.

661
00:39:47,843 --> 00:39:49,345
That threw me off.

662
00:39:49,428 --> 00:39:50,388
It ticked me off too.

663
00:39:51,013 --> 00:39:52,139
You don't know Ryu Si-o?

664
00:39:52,223 --> 00:39:54,934
Who the hell is he?

665
00:39:55,643 --> 00:39:57,353
Do tell me. I'm just dying to know.

666
00:40:02,691 --> 00:40:04,235
Why are you in Busan?

667
00:40:04,318 --> 00:40:05,403
I…

668
00:40:07,363 --> 00:40:08,864
visit the city now and again

669
00:40:09,448 --> 00:40:10,741
when I'm burned out and lonely.

670
00:40:11,867 --> 00:40:14,870
Busan seagull

671
00:40:15,496 --> 00:40:19,625
Have you truly forgotten about me?

672
00:40:19,708 --> 00:40:21,168
Shut up.

673
00:40:21,252 --> 00:40:24,255
Busan seagull

674
00:40:24,338 --> 00:40:27,758
-Busan seagull
-Shut it.

675
00:40:27,842 --> 00:40:30,052
-Shut up, will you?
-Have you

676
00:40:30,136 --> 00:40:32,096
Truly forgotten about me?

677
00:40:32,179 --> 00:40:33,305
Zip it.

678
00:40:35,724 --> 00:40:38,227
Dad, Mom told us
to eat at the vacation house.

679
00:40:38,310 --> 00:40:40,396
Why come to Busan just to stay cooped up?

680
00:40:40,479 --> 00:40:42,273
We should get to enjoy the ocean.

681
00:40:42,356 --> 00:40:43,732
Mom will throw a fit when she…

682
00:40:45,818 --> 00:40:46,819
Mom's here.

683
00:40:57,913 --> 00:40:59,206
You should wipe this cream off

684
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:01,167
with your lips.

685
00:41:02,293 --> 00:41:03,544
Be patient.

686
00:41:03,627 --> 00:41:06,213
You'll be eating
all this lipstick off anyway,

687
00:41:08,299 --> 00:41:09,925
so let me apply another coat.

688
00:41:10,676 --> 00:41:12,761
Why bother when it'll only come off?

689
00:41:15,222 --> 00:41:16,056
Come…

690
00:41:16,765 --> 00:41:17,683
closer.

691
00:41:18,392 --> 00:41:19,727
My baby.

692
00:41:20,686 --> 00:41:22,396
I'm being sucked into you.

693
00:41:26,817 --> 00:41:28,903
Being here with you is a waste of my time.

694
00:41:29,487 --> 00:41:30,488
I'm leaving.

695
00:41:45,628 --> 00:41:46,670
I have

696
00:41:47,671 --> 00:41:49,381
connections in Russia.

697
00:41:50,674 --> 00:41:52,676
I think I'll be of use to you.

698
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:53,761
I suggest

699
00:41:54,845 --> 00:41:56,847
a mutual partnership.

700
00:41:58,682 --> 00:42:00,226
So how can I be of service?

701
00:42:05,731 --> 00:42:06,857
Mom, let's take a photo.

702
00:42:08,526 --> 00:42:11,111
Okay. Now, smile.

703
00:42:20,371 --> 00:42:21,664
SEA

704
00:42:21,747 --> 00:42:23,082
"Ba-da."

705
00:42:23,165 --> 00:42:24,124
"Ba-da"?

706
00:42:49,149 --> 00:42:50,359
How is it?

707
00:42:50,985 --> 00:42:51,860
It's delicious.

708
00:42:57,366 --> 00:42:59,535
Busan is famous for its soup with rice.

709
00:43:00,202 --> 00:43:02,454
It's sort of like the Mongolian bantan.

710
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:04,415
Let's try some.

711
00:43:04,498 --> 00:43:05,708
Let's enjoy the view as we eat.

712
00:43:05,791 --> 00:43:07,543
I really like the sea.

713
00:43:07,626 --> 00:43:09,795
Mongolia doesn't have a seashore.

714
00:43:11,338 --> 00:43:12,298
Mom.

715
00:43:12,381 --> 00:43:13,841
Catch me if you can!

716
00:43:27,229 --> 00:43:29,106
Damn it.

717
00:43:32,067 --> 00:43:33,152
Let go.

718
00:43:42,453 --> 00:43:43,287
Goodness.

719
00:43:49,710 --> 00:43:51,712
You brazen adulteress.

720
00:43:51,795 --> 00:43:53,881
Did you just call me an adulteress?
Why you…

721
00:43:55,257 --> 00:43:56,300
Ms. Gil,

722
00:43:56,383 --> 00:43:58,677
acts of violence
can work against you in court.

723
00:44:00,888 --> 00:44:02,139
I'm glad you brought that up.

724
00:44:02,222 --> 00:44:03,849
I've already been assaulted.

725
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:06,977
That man she committed adultery with

726
00:44:07,061 --> 00:44:08,771
nearly tore my mouth.

727
00:44:08,854 --> 00:44:09,688
Hey.

728
00:44:10,439 --> 00:44:12,107
I hired a lawyer,

729
00:44:12,191 --> 00:44:13,651
and so should you.

730
00:44:14,276 --> 00:44:16,070
I'll pay the retainer.

731
00:44:16,153 --> 00:44:17,905
How generous of me.

732
00:44:18,656 --> 00:44:19,782
You'll take legal action?

733
00:44:20,324 --> 00:44:23,327
I'll press charges against that punk,
Seo Jun-hee, for adultery.

734
00:44:23,410 --> 00:44:24,536
Mr. Hwang,

735
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:26,080
-Goodness.
-I'm afraid

736
00:44:26,163 --> 00:44:28,415
what you just said will only hurt you.

737
00:44:28,499 --> 00:44:29,458
What?

738
00:44:29,541 --> 00:44:31,585
Adultery was decriminalized
seven years ago.

739
00:44:32,336 --> 00:44:34,088
You just proved in your own words

740
00:44:34,171 --> 00:44:36,048
that you abandoned your family
for a long time.

741
00:44:36,131 --> 00:44:37,716
Adultery isn't a crime anymore?

742
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:39,635
Why not? It's such a fair crime.

743
00:44:39,718 --> 00:44:41,428
There's no such thing as "a fair crime."

744
00:44:41,512 --> 00:44:44,098
I didn't mean it in the way you think.

745
00:44:44,682 --> 00:44:46,517
Anyway, why was it abolished?

746
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:49,269
I want that adulterer of hers behind bars.

747
00:44:49,853 --> 00:44:52,022
Stop referring to him that way.

748
00:44:52,106 --> 00:44:53,148
Please don't.

749
00:44:56,068 --> 00:44:57,111
Right.

750
00:44:58,195 --> 00:44:59,947
Okay, we'll end it in a civil manner.

751
00:45:00,781 --> 00:45:03,534
You should also behave
in a gentlemanly manner.

752
00:45:03,617 --> 00:45:06,286
Who can be polite and civil
in the face of love?

753
00:45:06,370 --> 00:45:08,038
I won't ever let you go.

754
00:45:08,122 --> 00:45:09,289
It's too late for that!

755
00:45:09,373 --> 00:45:11,500
You should've said that ten years ago

756
00:45:11,583 --> 00:45:13,168
rather than leaving me!

757
00:45:13,252 --> 00:45:15,003
That was because I went to Tibet--

758
00:45:15,087 --> 00:45:17,673
Tell me. Could you do
without a wife back then

759
00:45:17,756 --> 00:45:19,091
since you were young and fit?

760
00:45:19,716 --> 00:45:21,927
But now that you're old and sick,

761
00:45:22,010 --> 00:45:24,012
your love for me is suddenly rekindled

762
00:45:24,096 --> 00:45:26,432
and you want to cling to me?

763
00:45:26,974 --> 00:45:28,559
In your dreams! Get lost!

764
00:45:28,642 --> 00:45:29,768
I refuse!

765
00:45:30,310 --> 00:45:31,562
I never will!

766
00:45:31,645 --> 00:45:33,772
You'll grow old by my side!

767
00:45:33,856 --> 00:45:35,649
What? Why you…

768
00:45:35,732 --> 00:45:36,942
Ms. Gil, don't!

769
00:45:37,025 --> 00:45:39,361
-Get over here.
-Please!

770
00:45:39,445 --> 00:45:41,572
I could end him
with just a flick of the wrist.

771
00:45:41,655 --> 00:45:42,948
-You…
-Please don't.

772
00:45:43,031 --> 00:45:44,533
-Please hold back.
-All right.

773
00:45:44,616 --> 00:45:45,617
I'll hold back.

774
00:45:46,243 --> 00:45:48,120
-As if.
-Ma'am!

775
00:45:48,203 --> 00:45:49,997
-Please don't.
-Get over here.

776
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:51,373
-You…
-Ma'am, no.

777
00:45:51,457 --> 00:45:52,416
Cheers.

778
00:45:57,004 --> 00:45:58,964
Life must be good for you now.

779
00:45:59,047 --> 00:46:00,841
It shows on your face.

780
00:46:00,924 --> 00:46:03,385
Thanks to the allowance
and a place to stay from my mom,

781
00:46:03,469 --> 00:46:04,761
I've been attending vocational school.

782
00:46:04,845 --> 00:46:06,722
I'm going to get my excavator license.

783
00:46:06,805 --> 00:46:09,725
From here on out,
I'm going to lead a decent life.

784
00:46:09,808 --> 00:46:10,851
Your mom?

785
00:46:11,393 --> 00:46:13,020
As in Gang Nam-soon's mom?

786
00:46:17,274 --> 00:46:20,444
Let's live above board
and enjoy upstanding lives.

787
00:46:21,612 --> 00:46:22,988
No more getting hurt outside the law.

788
00:46:24,615 --> 00:46:26,241
You can do it too.

789
00:46:26,325 --> 00:46:27,409
I'll help.

790
00:46:34,583 --> 00:46:38,086
MOTHER

791
00:46:47,387 --> 00:46:48,388
That was delicious.

792
00:46:49,431 --> 00:46:51,266
-Where are you headed?
-Home.

793
00:46:51,350 --> 00:46:52,643
-I'll be off.
-Bye.

794
00:48:06,133 --> 00:48:07,884
I said lying would cost you your life.

795
00:48:10,387 --> 00:48:11,388
You said Tsetseg

796
00:48:12,347 --> 00:48:13,682
wasn't Gang Nam-soon.

797
00:48:40,834 --> 00:48:42,586
MOTHER

798
00:48:44,338 --> 00:48:45,255
Hello?

799
00:48:45,964 --> 00:48:46,965
Myung-hee?

800
00:48:47,507 --> 00:48:49,301
I saw that you had called.

801
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:51,803
Is everything all right?

802
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:14,660
Prosecutor Moon,
based on Judge Hwang's testimony,

803
00:49:14,743 --> 00:49:17,788
you'll be questioned on your involvement
with Heritage and Ryu Si-o.

804
00:49:17,871 --> 00:49:18,997
SEOUL CENTRAL DISTRICT PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

805
00:49:19,081 --> 00:49:20,832
The public is out for blood,

806
00:49:21,625 --> 00:49:22,793
so you should attend.

807
00:49:23,502 --> 00:49:24,670
It will be held upstairs.

808
00:49:39,267 --> 00:49:40,268
Jun-hee…

809
00:49:49,027 --> 00:49:54,157
IF YOU WANT TO SAVE YOUR MAN,
COME TO 104 CHEONSU-RO

810
00:50:03,709 --> 00:50:05,585
How dare that old hag hurt our boss?

811
00:50:05,669 --> 00:50:07,546
There's no way she did this herself.

812
00:50:07,629 --> 00:50:09,589
Tell us who's responsible for this!

813
00:50:20,642 --> 00:50:21,518
Jun-hee.

814
00:50:21,601 --> 00:50:24,229
Joong-gan! These are dangerous people!

815
00:50:24,312 --> 00:50:26,648
How dare you go after my man?

816
00:50:26,732 --> 00:50:27,774
Bring it!

817
00:50:48,295 --> 00:50:49,796
Joong-gan…

818
00:51:03,685 --> 00:51:04,728
Jun-hee.

819
00:51:10,984 --> 00:51:11,985
Jun-hee.

820
00:51:18,742 --> 00:51:19,993
Welcome.

821
00:51:20,076 --> 00:51:21,495
It was hard, wasn't it?

822
00:51:23,622 --> 00:51:25,624
I'm sorry you had to go through that.

823
00:51:25,707 --> 00:51:26,833
It's all right.

824
00:51:26,917 --> 00:51:28,794
This happened because of me.

825
00:51:30,086 --> 00:51:31,588
Joong-gan…

826
00:51:35,342 --> 00:51:36,927
If you continue to be by my side,

827
00:51:37,010 --> 00:51:39,387
something like this could happen again.

828
00:51:45,936 --> 00:51:48,772
I'll always be by your side.

829
00:51:51,316 --> 00:51:52,651
Then you should eat up.

830
00:51:53,485 --> 00:51:56,822
This is the best dish in this restaurant.

831
00:52:02,118 --> 00:52:03,537
-It's good.
-Is it?

832
00:52:06,456 --> 00:52:08,124
Jun-hee,

833
00:52:08,208 --> 00:52:10,877
why don't we go somewhere romantic

834
00:52:10,961 --> 00:52:12,629
after this?

835
00:52:14,172 --> 00:52:16,842
What do you say to some cocktails?

836
00:52:20,554 --> 00:52:21,596
Can you get the lock?

837
00:52:26,434 --> 00:52:27,686
You can come out.

838
00:52:27,769 --> 00:52:29,604
The new commissioner general
has ordered it. Come on.

839
00:52:30,605 --> 00:52:32,399
It's total chaos.

840
00:52:32,482 --> 00:52:33,692
The entire nation is in uproar.

841
00:52:34,359 --> 00:52:36,903
There's a warrant out
for Ryu Si-o's arrest

842
00:52:36,987 --> 00:52:38,196
and a travel ban.

843
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:41,491
Everyone involved
is about to lose their positions.

844
00:52:45,745 --> 00:52:46,746
Keep up the good work.

845
00:52:47,873 --> 00:52:48,999
That was a tough one.

846
00:52:49,082 --> 00:52:50,667
I meant for us, not you.

847
00:52:52,752 --> 00:52:53,962
Have a good one.

848
00:53:00,010 --> 00:53:03,096
The DIU at Ganghan Police Precinct
has been reinstated.

849
00:53:04,306 --> 00:53:05,807
A special counsel will handle the case.

850
00:53:16,443 --> 00:53:18,445
Dad, let's head back now.

851
00:53:21,615 --> 00:53:22,490
Aren't you heading back?

852
00:53:22,574 --> 00:53:23,992
Your mother

853
00:53:24,492 --> 00:53:25,952
is seeing someone.

854
00:53:26,036 --> 00:53:27,203
But Mom…

855
00:53:28,788 --> 00:53:29,956
I didn't think she would.

856
00:53:33,585 --> 00:53:35,921
Why am I tearing up?

857
00:53:36,796 --> 00:53:37,923
I'm sad for some reason,

858
00:53:38,506 --> 00:53:39,633
even though we're divorced.

859
00:53:39,716 --> 00:53:41,968
I'm sure it's not true.

860
00:53:42,052 --> 00:53:42,928
I'll ask her.

861
00:53:45,305 --> 00:53:46,181
Dad.

862
00:53:47,307 --> 00:53:48,391
Dad.

863
00:53:49,100 --> 00:53:50,769
This must be how Uncle feels.

864
00:53:51,686 --> 00:53:52,938
Come on, Dad.

865
00:53:53,021 --> 00:53:54,314
Don't cry.

866
00:53:56,816 --> 00:53:58,026
I don't know why,

867
00:53:59,110 --> 00:54:00,987
but my heart aches.

868
00:54:01,863 --> 00:54:03,365
It'll be all right.

869
00:54:04,950 --> 00:54:06,618
You'll be okay.

870
00:54:14,167 --> 00:54:15,293
Who is it?

871
00:54:16,336 --> 00:54:17,337
It's me.

872
00:54:28,932 --> 00:54:30,225
Are you all right?

873
00:54:30,308 --> 00:54:31,309
It must be hard.

874
00:54:31,393 --> 00:54:34,187
I'm not all right, but things aren't hard.

875
00:54:34,270 --> 00:54:36,481
Shouldn't you be all right
if things aren't hard?

876
00:54:36,564 --> 00:54:37,565
It doesn't make sense.

877
00:54:37,649 --> 00:54:39,818
I'm not in the mood for riddles.

878
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:41,820
I'd like to rest.

879
00:54:46,992 --> 00:54:47,909
Na-young,

880
00:54:49,202 --> 00:54:50,286
if things are hard,

881
00:54:52,414 --> 00:54:53,581
you can lean on me.

882
00:54:54,290 --> 00:54:55,500
-I--
-Damn it.

883
00:54:55,583 --> 00:54:57,585
Stop creeping me out, Geum-dong.

884
00:54:58,086 --> 00:55:00,005
I've had it with you
coming on to me like this.

885
00:55:00,088 --> 00:55:01,506
Why you…

886
00:55:01,589 --> 00:55:03,174
Unbelievable.

887
00:55:10,181 --> 00:55:12,809
You aren't my type at all.

888
00:55:13,309 --> 00:55:16,062
I prefer my men to be brawny,
thank you very much.

889
00:55:16,146 --> 00:55:17,105
Na-young, I--

890
00:55:33,496 --> 00:55:35,915
Mr. Ryu, it's over.

891
00:55:36,458 --> 00:55:38,543
Judge Hwang and Prosecutor Moon
were arrested,

892
00:55:38,626 --> 00:55:41,046
and CTA4885 blew up
to become a major scandal.

893
00:55:41,129 --> 00:55:43,089
Lee Jeong-sik,
the new commissioner general,

894
00:55:43,715 --> 00:55:46,801
played the wild card
to put us all behind bars.

895
00:55:46,885 --> 00:55:48,678
Where is this Commissioner General Lee?

896
00:55:50,221 --> 00:55:53,016
DOGANG STATIONERY

897
00:56:07,822 --> 00:56:09,074
I'd like a ballpoint pen.

898
00:56:10,325 --> 00:56:11,326
One with a 0.5 mm tip.

899
00:57:02,710 --> 00:57:03,628
What on earth?

900
00:57:04,254 --> 00:57:05,880
-Are you all right, sir?
-Yes.

901
00:57:14,139 --> 00:57:15,557
-See who he is.
-Get out there.

902
00:57:18,768 --> 00:57:19,602
What are you doing?

903
00:58:19,871 --> 00:58:21,789
My sister is fine,

904
00:58:22,415 --> 00:58:24,417
and there won't be any further trouble.

905
00:58:25,043 --> 00:58:26,044
I'm glad to hear that.

906
00:58:27,128 --> 00:58:29,464
The world may be crawling with bad people,

907
00:58:30,131 --> 00:58:32,091
but there are plenty of good ones as well.

908
00:58:33,343 --> 00:58:36,137
This is the video file I took
from the sea hare hatchery.

909
00:58:36,221 --> 00:58:37,388
Let's edit it.

910
00:58:37,472 --> 00:58:38,556
Yes, ma'am.

911
00:58:54,447 --> 00:58:55,865
I'm off to the bathroom.

912
00:58:55,949 --> 00:58:56,950
Sure.

913
00:59:00,411 --> 00:59:02,205
Hi, it's Hwa-ja.

914
00:59:02,872 --> 00:59:05,166
How are you, Gang Nam-soon?

915
00:59:06,668 --> 00:59:08,503
Yeah, it's been a while.

916
00:59:09,087 --> 00:59:10,380
How are you?

917
00:59:11,714 --> 00:59:13,466
I've been doing well.

918
00:59:26,646 --> 00:59:29,023
We're supposed to
cover the night shift today,

919
00:59:30,191 --> 00:59:34,153
so let's complete
our last shift at this place.

920
00:59:35,863 --> 00:59:38,575
But it still feels like
we're leaving too soon.

921
00:59:38,658 --> 00:59:39,993
It's a bummer.

922
00:59:41,327 --> 00:59:42,453
Come to think of it,

923
00:59:43,955 --> 00:59:45,290
that thing's a vault, right?

924
00:59:46,165 --> 00:59:47,166
Right.

925
00:59:47,250 --> 00:59:49,043
It must be loaded with cash.

926
00:59:49,127 --> 00:59:50,128
Right.

927
00:59:50,712 --> 00:59:52,046
And diamonds.

928
00:59:52,130 --> 00:59:53,881
-Right.
-Lucky you, Hee-sik.

929
00:59:56,009 --> 00:59:56,843
Hee-sik,

930
00:59:56,926 --> 00:59:59,304
please adopt me after you get married.

931
00:59:59,387 --> 01:00:01,431
I can easily abandon my parents.

932
01:00:01,514 --> 01:00:02,807
Some son they raised.

933
01:00:05,310 --> 01:00:08,062
No one's around the house tonight.

934
01:00:08,146 --> 01:00:11,357
Can't we sleep upstairs
instead of being cooped up here?

935
01:00:11,441 --> 01:00:13,651
We're to stay hidden
like that family in Parasite.

936
01:00:13,735 --> 01:00:15,903
But no one's home.

937
01:00:16,988 --> 01:00:19,699
Let's make some ram-don
if we're going to reenact Parasite anyway.

938
01:00:25,705 --> 01:00:26,789
Get up.

939
01:00:27,790 --> 01:00:29,042
-Come on.
-Don't.

940
01:00:29,125 --> 01:00:31,753
-What are you doing?
-We'll eat and come back down.

941
01:00:33,296 --> 01:00:34,213
Come on.

942
01:00:39,010 --> 01:00:39,927
There.

943
01:00:40,511 --> 01:00:42,013
Whatever.

944
01:00:47,310 --> 01:00:48,269
We should hurry back.

945
01:00:50,355 --> 01:00:51,856
-Are you good?
-I'm good.

946
01:00:56,277 --> 01:00:57,111
Sweetie.

947
01:00:57,862 --> 01:00:58,780
What is it, darling?

948
01:00:59,489 --> 01:01:01,449
Why don't we continue

949
01:01:01,949 --> 01:01:03,576
that Netflix show from the other night?

950
01:01:03,660 --> 01:01:05,828
Sure. Let's pick up where we left off.

951
01:01:08,873 --> 01:01:09,916
Sweetie,

952
01:01:09,999 --> 01:01:12,126
don't you smell
black bean sauce instant noodles?

953
01:01:13,252 --> 01:01:14,337
I actually do.

954
01:01:14,420 --> 01:01:15,505
I smell it too.

955
01:01:18,216 --> 01:01:19,342
It's intoxicating.

956
01:01:23,429 --> 01:01:24,764
Should we make some?

957
01:01:24,847 --> 01:01:26,099
We should.

958
01:01:27,225 --> 01:01:28,685
But I'll gain weight.

959
01:01:29,811 --> 01:01:31,479
You hardly have any meat on your bones.

960
01:01:34,857 --> 01:01:36,984
Sweetie, I'm very heavy.

961
01:01:37,068 --> 01:01:39,195
You're as light as a feather.

962
01:01:40,029 --> 01:01:43,741
You shouldn't be wasting
your energy like this.

963
01:01:45,702 --> 01:01:47,286
Gosh, sweetie.

964
01:01:49,372 --> 01:01:50,456
My gosh.

965
01:01:51,666 --> 01:01:55,420
All the women of this household
are striking characters.

966
01:01:55,503 --> 01:01:57,296
You should brace yourself.

967
01:01:57,380 --> 01:02:00,383
Let's clean this up and head back down
before they come back.

968
01:02:00,466 --> 01:02:02,593
-Clean up and go.
-Let's go.

969
01:02:02,677 --> 01:02:03,886
Let's get going.

970
01:02:05,471 --> 01:02:06,889
Tidy up.

971
01:02:14,105 --> 01:02:15,148
Hello?

972
01:02:18,568 --> 01:02:19,652
What?

973
01:02:21,446 --> 01:02:22,613
The commissioner general?

974
01:02:29,203 --> 01:02:30,037
I'm…

975
01:02:31,038 --> 01:02:32,081
dead.

976
01:02:34,459 --> 01:02:37,795
Ryu Si-o killed me

977
01:02:39,005 --> 01:02:42,467
for saying that I didn't know you.

978
01:02:54,437 --> 01:02:55,480
Ryu Si-o.

979
01:02:57,356 --> 01:03:00,109
So you've finally found out who I am.

980
01:03:05,656 --> 01:03:07,074
You're next.

981
01:03:52,537 --> 01:03:54,956
STRONG GIRL NAM-SOON

982
01:03:55,039 --> 01:03:55,915
Ryu Si-o.

983
01:03:56,666 --> 01:03:59,919
I will show the world
what kind of fate awaits evil.

984
01:04:00,002 --> 01:04:01,504
It's been a while, Ms. Hwang.

985
01:04:01,587 --> 01:04:05,216
It's still wrong
to join forces with druggies.

986
01:04:05,299 --> 01:04:06,634
Where's Bread Song?

987
01:04:06,717 --> 01:04:09,595
I can't lead an ordinary life,
even if it means I'll die.

988
01:04:09,679 --> 01:04:10,805
What about the rest of us?

989
01:04:10,888 --> 01:04:12,682
You can't die. Promise me that.

990
01:04:12,765 --> 01:04:14,642
Are your adoptive parents
still precious to you?

991
01:04:14,725 --> 01:04:15,893
What do you want?

992
01:04:15,977 --> 01:04:17,478
I'd like to conduct one final test.

993
01:04:17,562 --> 01:04:20,147
-Where's Nam-soon?
-I don't know.

994
01:04:20,231 --> 01:04:22,358
Nam-soon will die!

995
01:04:22,441 --> 01:04:25,069
Let me save my family with my life.

996
01:04:25,778 --> 01:04:30,783
