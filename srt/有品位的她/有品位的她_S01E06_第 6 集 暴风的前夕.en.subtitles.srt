1
00:01:18,286 --> 00:01:19,537
Everyone should watch this.

2
00:01:20,121 --> 00:01:21,164
What is it?

3
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,249
JIN-HEE

4
00:01:32,884 --> 00:01:35,053
Father, there's something
I have to tell you.

5
00:01:35,178 --> 00:01:37,013
I have something to tell you guys too.

6
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,224
All of you are here,

7
00:01:40,391 --> 00:01:41,351
so this is perfect.

8
00:01:41,976 --> 00:01:43,812
Do you mind waiting upstairs with Ms. Jo?

9
00:01:43,895 --> 00:01:45,063
That's not necessary.

10
00:01:46,689 --> 00:01:47,565
I...

11
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:51,611
have decided to marry her.

12
00:01:53,279 --> 00:01:54,697
-Dad!
-Father.

13
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:56,699
What are you talking about?

14
00:01:56,991 --> 00:01:58,660
Father, this is unacceptable.

15
00:01:58,785 --> 00:02:00,203
Father, you can't!

16
00:02:00,286 --> 00:02:02,122
You're not serious, are you?

17
00:02:02,205 --> 00:02:05,416
I want to get married
and who are you to refuse?

18
00:02:06,084 --> 00:02:08,294
So, do you dare to stop me?

19
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:12,382
Dad, you barely even know her.

20
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:14,008
You can't take marriage lightly.

21
00:02:14,092 --> 00:02:15,426
Who says that I'm taking this lightly?

22
00:02:16,094 --> 00:02:17,137
You're disgraceful.

23
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:20,390
Father, your marriage affects us too.

24
00:02:20,473 --> 00:02:21,850
Can't you all just shut up?

25
00:02:22,183 --> 00:02:23,935
Goodness, Mr. Chairman.

26
00:02:24,435 --> 00:02:26,354
Marriage is a big deal.

27
00:02:26,437 --> 00:02:29,023
It affects the others' lives.

28
00:02:29,566 --> 00:02:31,860
Instead of being angry at them,

29
00:02:31,943 --> 00:02:36,781
you should at least hear out
what your family has to say.

30
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:45,123
She'll take the place
of our deceased mother-in-law.

31
00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:49,836
She'll be your wife, but she'll also be
one of the elders in this house.

32
00:02:50,378 --> 00:02:52,297
You shouldn't make this decision alone.

33
00:02:53,464 --> 00:02:54,340
Moreover,

34
00:02:56,092 --> 00:02:58,803
we can't let someone who had been
convicted of fraud and embezzlement

35
00:02:58,887 --> 00:02:59,888
be part of this family.

36
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:02,765
Fraud and embezzlement? Is that true?

37
00:03:03,308 --> 00:03:05,560
No way. He must be out of his mind.

38
00:03:05,643 --> 00:03:08,438
Her child had leukemia,

39
00:03:08,563 --> 00:03:10,148
so she embezzled money from her company.

40
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:13,109
You all have children, don't you all?

41
00:03:13,234 --> 00:03:15,945
If Ji-hu or Un-gyu had
such a terrible disease

42
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:19,657
and you had no money,
wouldn't you steal for your own child?

43
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:21,868
That's what any parent would do.

44
00:03:22,285 --> 00:03:23,745
You all have no sympathy.

45
00:03:29,792 --> 00:03:30,919
JIN-HEE

46
00:03:38,259 --> 00:03:40,470
This is a video taken
at your birthday party.

47
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:43,556
Who is this?

48
00:03:44,307 --> 00:03:47,268
As you can see,
someone made the canopy collapse.

49
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:51,397
What happened that day
was not a mere accident.

50
00:03:51,856 --> 00:03:53,191
It was intentional.

51
00:03:58,529 --> 00:04:01,115
We should think the marriage through.

52
00:04:01,532 --> 00:04:04,077
-And Father...
-You should call the police.

53
00:04:06,037 --> 00:04:08,790
I also felt that something
was fishy that day.

54
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:12,293
When the canopy collapsed the way it did,

55
00:04:13,044 --> 00:04:16,547
I had a feeling that someone
with bad intentions

56
00:04:16,631 --> 00:04:19,092
was behind it all.

57
00:04:19,676 --> 00:04:23,596
So, you're saying that someone
did that to hurt my dad?

58
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:28,893
That's what I've been thinking,
but I couldn't be sure.

59
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:31,896
Now that we have

60
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:34,732
the video as proof,

61
00:04:35,483 --> 00:04:38,027
we should find out who the culprit is.

62
00:04:39,737 --> 00:04:43,783
After what happened, I knew that
I had to protect Mr. Chairman.

63
00:04:44,075 --> 00:04:45,868
I was positive

64
00:04:46,035 --> 00:04:50,206
that this house was dangerous
for him to be alone.

65
00:04:50,331 --> 00:04:52,083
What are you suggesting?

66
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:55,461
Are you implying
that one of his children did this?

67
00:04:55,545 --> 00:04:58,172
Judging from the situation, it's possible.

68
00:04:58,589 --> 00:04:59,632
Shut your mouth!

69
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:05,138
Or maybe it's not his children.

70
00:05:06,597 --> 00:05:07,765
What?

71
00:05:09,017 --> 00:05:12,395
How dare you speak like that
to my future wife?

72
00:05:13,229 --> 00:05:15,523
There's no order in this place!
Telling her to shut up and all.

73
00:05:16,357 --> 00:05:17,483
You have no shame.

74
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:22,113
There is another video that's clearer.

75
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:28,161
We should put the discussion
about your marriage on hold.

76
00:05:28,411 --> 00:05:29,287
Why?

77
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:32,623
We should find out who is behind this.

78
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:33,791
Don't you want to know?

79
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:35,668
What does that have to do
with my marriage?

80
00:05:35,752 --> 00:05:37,086
Why does it not?

81
00:05:37,378 --> 00:05:39,213
She is one of the suspects.

82
00:05:41,257 --> 00:05:42,258
What?

83
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:46,512
If she claims that one of
our family members is a suspect,

84
00:05:47,388 --> 00:05:50,600
she can be a suspect too. Don't you think?

85
00:05:50,683 --> 00:05:51,517
That's right.

86
00:05:51,726 --> 00:05:53,603
Do you think she's crazy enough
to do such a thing?

87
00:05:53,686 --> 00:05:56,898
After all, this was the incident
that led you to want to marry her.

88
00:05:57,815 --> 00:06:01,110
If that was her motivation, it's possible.

89
00:06:02,945 --> 00:06:05,406
I'm disappointed in you.

90
00:06:05,573 --> 00:06:06,991
Tell me.

91
00:06:07,408 --> 00:06:09,494
Did you see this coming?

92
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:11,037
See what coming?

93
00:06:11,829 --> 00:06:14,248
That you'll end up marrying Father.

94
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:16,918
I had no idea.

95
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:19,253
Is that so? I guess I am mistaken.

96
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:21,881
It's such a shame

97
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:25,885
that all the evidence is pointing to you
when you have no ulterior motive.

98
00:06:25,968 --> 00:06:31,474
If you don't want to be misunderstood,
tell him that you won't marry him.

99
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:36,646
I will always

100
00:06:37,396 --> 00:06:39,607
protect Mr. Chairman.

101
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:43,402
If marriage is what it takes,

102
00:06:44,695 --> 00:06:45,738
then I'll do it.

103
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:50,034
You are already protecting him
as a caregiver.

104
00:06:50,493 --> 00:06:53,871
Stop trying to be more than that.

105
00:06:54,497 --> 00:06:55,748
Don't cross the line.

106
00:06:55,873 --> 00:06:59,001
Father, she's the one
who forced Un-gyu outside in the rain.

107
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:02,213
Do you expect me to treat her
as my mother-in-law?

108
00:07:02,296 --> 00:07:05,633
If you don't want to,
take Un-gyu and leave this house!

109
00:07:05,716 --> 00:07:08,970
You shouldn't say that.

110
00:07:10,763 --> 00:07:13,433
Okay then. I'll leave.

111
00:07:13,516 --> 00:07:15,101
-Ju-mi.
-Dad.

112
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:17,937
Dad, do you like her
more than your grandson?

113
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:20,690
-How can you say that?
-You stay out of this!

114
00:07:20,857 --> 00:07:24,026
I'll bite my tongue and kill myself.

115
00:07:24,527 --> 00:07:28,364
If you don't want an old man
to get married, then I should just die.

116
00:07:28,865 --> 00:07:30,908
If I do,

117
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,035
don't ever come to my funeral.

118
00:07:33,161 --> 00:07:35,329
I don't regard you as my children.
Happy now?

119
00:07:44,672 --> 00:07:45,840
I'll leave.

120
00:07:46,883 --> 00:07:48,301
That will solve everything.

121
00:07:52,555 --> 00:07:53,848
Unbelievable.

122
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:09,071
Wash up and sleep.

123
00:08:09,572 --> 00:08:12,033
Okay. Don't overthink it.

124
00:08:12,408 --> 00:08:14,243
They'll get married eventually.

125
00:08:14,785 --> 00:08:17,246
What? I can't believe you.

126
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:20,833
If they do, there's nothing
we can do to stop it.

127
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:23,794
The problem is that she didn't
end up here for no reason.

128
00:08:24,086 --> 00:08:25,838
She came here
to seek something for herself.

129
00:08:33,054 --> 00:08:34,597
Goodness, Mr. Chairman.

130
00:08:35,223 --> 00:08:37,225
We don't have to do this.

131
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:41,812
All I need is to be with you,

132
00:08:42,647 --> 00:08:43,814
that's all.

133
00:08:43,981 --> 00:08:45,107
Those brats.

134
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:48,402
Who are they to refuse?

135
00:08:52,573 --> 00:08:53,824
Are you going to the second floor?

136
00:08:57,828 --> 00:08:59,163
I'll come back after I wash myself.

137
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:15,680
I'm so cold.

138
00:09:16,097 --> 00:09:18,349
Go to sleep. I'm not in the mood.

139
00:09:19,308 --> 00:09:20,142
Okay.

140
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:37,743
Wake up. You need to exercise.

141
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:41,539
-Go on!
-I don't need to go today.

142
00:09:41,706 --> 00:09:43,583
-Where are you going then?
-We had a fight...

143
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:52,466
Stop being weak. Act normally.

144
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:53,676
Both you and I.

145
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:56,137
We need to be strong to get through this.

146
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:58,180
Just give up. Those two will get married.

147
00:09:58,556 --> 00:10:00,725
-What?
-Not me. I'm talking about Dad.

148
00:10:00,808 --> 00:10:01,976
What are you talking about?

149
00:10:04,061 --> 00:10:06,647
This raspberry juice gives me energy.

150
00:10:06,897 --> 00:10:07,857
I'm going out to exercise!

151
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:26,709
Namaste.

152
00:10:36,385 --> 00:10:39,221
The Pungsan woman
settled for one billion won.

153
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:41,223
At least, she didn't have a child.

154
00:10:41,849 --> 00:10:44,185
One billion won is too unfair.

155
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:46,354
The amount is too small
compared to his wealth.

156
00:10:46,437 --> 00:10:48,856
I heard she attempted suicide.
Is she okay?

157
00:10:49,023 --> 00:10:50,483
I heard she lost her voice.

158
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:55,029
A man really ruined a pretty girl's life.

159
00:10:55,571 --> 00:10:56,572
Yes.

160
00:10:57,907 --> 00:11:01,494
But I don't think the man
is the only one to blame.

161
00:11:01,744 --> 00:11:03,621
It takes two for an affair.

162
00:11:03,704 --> 00:11:06,082
-The woman probably seduced him.
-Probably.

163
00:11:08,626 --> 00:11:10,753
Is your husband doing all right?

164
00:11:11,253 --> 00:11:12,171
Yes.

165
00:11:13,881 --> 00:11:15,174
What about your husband?

166
00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:17,718
My husband is doing perfectly fine.

167
00:11:18,427 --> 00:11:19,387
I see.

168
00:11:21,472 --> 00:11:25,267
Every woman thinks
that her husband never cheats on her.

169
00:11:25,643 --> 00:11:29,313
But it's the husbands of those women
who cheat on them.

170
00:11:30,606 --> 00:11:31,732
I agree.

171
00:11:38,447 --> 00:11:41,367
I heard a new salad restaurant opened up
around the square. Let's check it out.

172
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:42,284
Yes.

173
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:46,872
Did you want to tell me something?

174
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:49,208
Yes, I do.

175
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:54,463
I guess that you're having a hard time
because of the caregiver.

176
00:11:54,922 --> 00:11:58,175
It's worse than it seems.
I can't find a solution to it.

177
00:11:58,342 --> 00:11:59,927
There is no solution.

178
00:12:00,594 --> 00:12:03,472
It's a never-ending fight
between a parent and child.

179
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:06,100
It would be easier to spank and teach him
a lesson only if he were a kid.

180
00:12:07,184 --> 00:12:10,104
I know that your father-in-law
has you occupied,

181
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:11,939
but pay attention to your husband.

182
00:12:13,607 --> 00:12:15,818
Normally, I would let
things like this slide,

183
00:12:16,777 --> 00:12:18,612
but I think I should tell you

184
00:12:19,363 --> 00:12:21,740
because you're special to me.

185
00:12:22,324 --> 00:12:23,826
Okay, I know.

186
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:28,873
I think your husband is cheating on you.

187
00:12:39,341 --> 00:12:41,385
-You're here.
-Did you finish your exercise?

188
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:44,013
It's so refreshing.

189
00:12:44,346 --> 00:12:48,058
I didn't know cycling
was such a good workout.

190
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:50,436
You never miss a single day.

191
00:12:50,561 --> 00:12:51,604
Impressive!

192
00:12:53,481 --> 00:12:54,398
Yes.

193
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:58,861
He bought the medicine
and said it's not for you.

194
00:12:58,944 --> 00:13:01,989
I see what's going on. You're mistaken.

195
00:13:02,156 --> 00:13:04,909
He rides his bike every day,
so he probably bought that medicine

196
00:13:05,075 --> 00:13:06,452
for his own health.

197
00:13:06,535 --> 00:13:08,370
The medicine isn't for health improvement.

198
00:13:08,537 --> 00:13:12,166
He takes all kinds
of supplements and tonics.

199
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:14,627
He's under a lot of stress
because of the new product launch.

200
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:17,922
He likes food that increases his stamina.

201
00:13:18,756 --> 00:13:20,424
-Is that so?
-Of course.

202
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:21,634
My gosh.

203
00:13:22,009 --> 00:13:23,677
Even if he did, there's no way

204
00:13:23,761 --> 00:13:25,888
that he would tell Dr. Jang
that he's cheating.

205
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:27,264
You're wrong.

206
00:13:27,431 --> 00:13:29,934
Men do share things like that
with each other.

207
00:13:30,017 --> 00:13:31,852
They know each other
through the kids' gatherings.

208
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:35,356
He'll know that telling Dr. Jang
will eventually reveal his secrets.

209
00:13:35,814 --> 00:13:38,108
He says ridiculous things like that often.

210
00:13:38,192 --> 00:13:40,903
Sometimes, it's hard to tell
if it's a joke or a lie.

211
00:13:41,946 --> 00:13:43,572
Then, there's nothing to worry about.

212
00:13:44,406 --> 00:13:47,201
Still, you should keep an eye on him.

213
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:50,287
I wish that you're right.

214
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:55,584
What about your husband?

215
00:13:55,876 --> 00:13:56,794
What about him?

216
00:13:57,753 --> 00:13:59,964
I'm just wondering.

217
00:14:00,464 --> 00:14:04,093
He's so handsome and fine
that he attracts a lot of pretty girls.

218
00:14:04,593 --> 00:14:05,844
That's very true.

219
00:14:06,136 --> 00:14:08,138
Doesn't he get handsome as he gets older?

220
00:14:08,597 --> 00:14:10,099
He's still very loyal to me.

221
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:13,185
Yesterday,

222
00:14:14,478 --> 00:14:15,688
he kept on going.

223
00:14:18,774 --> 00:14:19,608
I see.

224
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:21,318
Good for you.

225
00:14:24,989 --> 00:14:26,365
It stinks.

226
00:14:26,615 --> 00:14:29,243
What is this smell?

227
00:14:34,164 --> 00:14:36,000
Why did he have to say such things?

228
00:14:36,834 --> 00:14:38,335
He doesn't think when he talks.

229
00:14:49,346 --> 00:14:52,766
I'm planning on making pickles for Ji-hu
since we ran out of them.

230
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:53,767
Okay.

231
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:57,021
How long has it been
since your husband started cycling?

232
00:14:57,313 --> 00:14:59,732
I don't know. It's been a while I guess.

233
00:14:59,857 --> 00:15:03,027
Well, he never went
riding on one until today.

234
00:15:03,819 --> 00:15:06,739
-What?
-He hasn't been cycling every morning.

235
00:15:07,531 --> 00:15:09,116
Keep a watchful eye on him.

236
00:15:24,381 --> 00:15:26,008
MR. YUN

237
00:15:29,678 --> 00:15:31,263
TURN OFF

238
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:35,392
Am I working alone here?

239
00:15:35,476 --> 00:15:37,478
The number you have dialed
is switched off...

240
00:15:45,903 --> 00:15:48,364
I always thought that it was strange

241
00:15:48,572 --> 00:15:52,701
how his clothes wouldn't smell of sweat.
But today, his clothes stank.

242
00:15:53,577 --> 00:15:56,121
That means that he never

243
00:15:56,288 --> 00:15:58,415
went cycling until today.

244
00:15:58,999 --> 00:16:01,418
I saw your husband
at Take Two in Cheongdam-dong yesterday.

245
00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:02,503
He was with a woman.

246
00:16:02,586 --> 00:16:05,464
Oh, I heard that you had food
with a young girl at a café.

247
00:16:05,547 --> 00:16:06,632
I caught you red-handed!

248
00:16:07,508 --> 00:16:08,384
What?

249
00:16:21,689 --> 00:16:22,731
How are you, partner?

250
00:16:25,609 --> 00:16:27,653
Hi, partner.

251
00:16:29,613 --> 00:16:31,073
I'm not good at all.

252
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:46,463
Goodness. Don't be too disappointed.
You're too obsessing over it.

253
00:16:46,755 --> 00:16:47,923
Those brats.

254
00:16:48,465 --> 00:16:50,050
They are useless.

255
00:16:51,218 --> 00:16:52,886
Let's get married by ourselves.

256
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:55,973
Maybe you'll get a child

257
00:16:56,223 --> 00:17:00,102
who is not like them.

258
00:17:06,942 --> 00:17:07,985
Mr. Chairman.

259
00:17:09,403 --> 00:17:11,905
I want to have your baby.

260
00:17:17,661 --> 00:17:20,748
Father, she's the woman
who forced Un-gyu outside in the rain.

261
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:24,001
Do you expect me to treat her
as my mother-in-law?

262
00:17:24,084 --> 00:17:27,504
If you don't want to,
take Un-gyu and leave this house!

263
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:40,392
ACCOUNT BALANCE

264
00:17:53,989 --> 00:17:55,908
She got pregnant against her will.

265
00:17:56,533 --> 00:17:57,910
It was clearly a case of rape.

266
00:17:58,744 --> 00:18:01,080
I understand that they can't find out

267
00:18:01,163 --> 00:18:02,790
who the rapist is.

268
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:06,668
But expecting me to pay
for the hotel fees is absurd.

269
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:09,338
Of course. It is absurd.

270
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:12,549
The contract says that the hotel

271
00:18:12,633 --> 00:18:16,136
must protect the dog from any harm.

272
00:18:17,221 --> 00:18:18,680
But she got pregnant,

273
00:18:20,057 --> 00:18:21,934
so I will sue the hotel

274
00:18:22,017 --> 00:18:24,019
and I refuse to pay the hotel fees.

275
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:27,439
It is possible to sue the pet hotel,

276
00:18:28,023 --> 00:18:31,819
but are you sure
that she got pregnant there?

277
00:18:32,152 --> 00:18:35,823
Are you saying that she's a whore?

278
00:18:36,448 --> 00:18:37,616
That's not what I mean,

279
00:18:38,408 --> 00:18:42,246
but since the hotel says
that no such thing happened...

280
00:19:10,899 --> 00:19:13,110
How is it going with the caregiver?

281
00:19:21,577 --> 00:19:24,538
She is about to be my mother-in-law.

282
00:19:24,705 --> 00:19:27,791
Going mental. Emergency situation.
Depressed.

283
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:34,882
How much can you give me for all this?

284
00:19:40,262 --> 00:19:41,138
Never mind.

285
00:19:41,555 --> 00:19:42,514
Leave it.

286
00:20:01,116 --> 00:20:03,202
How long will it take?

287
00:20:04,494 --> 00:20:07,789
We can do everything,
but we don't make Korean ramp pickles.

288
00:20:07,956 --> 00:20:11,251
Angelica and Cedrela pickles
are our specialties.

289
00:20:11,418 --> 00:20:13,086
Make Korean ramp pickles.

290
00:20:13,754 --> 00:20:16,131
Mr. Chairman would like them.

291
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:18,091
I told you we don't make them.

292
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:23,847
You run this place illegally, don't you?

293
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:29,102
You certainly are not paying any taxes.

294
00:20:31,146 --> 00:20:32,940
To make someone side with you,

295
00:20:33,148 --> 00:20:35,484
rather than persuasion or appeasement,

296
00:20:35,817 --> 00:20:39,154
acting upon their weakness
is a powerful strategy.

297
00:20:42,324 --> 00:20:46,662
Everyone has secrets and weaknesses,

298
00:20:48,705 --> 00:20:53,460
which are only to be revealed

299
00:20:53,794 --> 00:20:57,422
by someone who will take advantage of it.

300
00:21:02,719 --> 00:21:04,846
He's in a good mood.

301
00:21:07,015 --> 00:21:08,225
He's buying her a car.

302
00:21:13,021 --> 00:21:14,356
I'll try all of these on.

303
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:17,025
Okay. I'll get them ready for you.

304
00:21:17,818 --> 00:21:19,903
You have one just like that.
Are you buying another one?

305
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:31,039
Dad. I like this car the most.

306
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:33,292
-This car suits you best.
-Really?

307
00:21:35,168 --> 00:21:37,504
That will be eight million
and 32 thousand won.

308
00:21:47,472 --> 00:21:49,599
Goodbye.

309
00:21:49,683 --> 00:21:50,809
Goodbye.

310
00:21:51,184 --> 00:21:53,603
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

311
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:03,280
You should greet them back.

312
00:22:03,447 --> 00:22:05,115
Don't you have manners?

313
00:22:06,616 --> 00:22:08,201
I guess I don't.

314
00:22:09,911 --> 00:22:13,081
Look who's talking!

315
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:15,459
-Have you gone mad?
-Watch what you say.

316
00:22:15,667 --> 00:22:17,169
If I don't have manners,

317
00:22:18,378 --> 00:22:19,796
neither do you.

318
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,089
Bitch.

319
00:22:22,007 --> 00:22:23,842
Hey. Are you crazy?

320
00:22:27,721 --> 00:22:30,057
-Bastard.
-What?

321
00:22:31,767 --> 00:22:34,186
Hey. Get out.

322
00:22:34,478 --> 00:22:36,813
Get home and take a beating.

323
00:22:37,439 --> 00:22:38,732
-No.
-You need a beating.

324
00:22:39,066 --> 00:22:39,983
Come.

325
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:43,862
Come.

326
00:22:47,699 --> 00:22:50,202
Do you want to meet tonight?
Don't you miss me?

327
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:53,038
Come to my room.

328
00:22:53,121 --> 00:22:54,664
I feel insecure in other locations.

329
00:22:55,499 --> 00:22:57,501
Okay. See you then.

330
00:22:59,294 --> 00:23:02,047
What was that?
That sounds like you're talking to a man.

331
00:23:02,172 --> 00:23:03,048
That's right.

332
00:23:04,174 --> 00:23:06,885
I was right. Is that who I think it is?

333
00:23:07,427 --> 00:23:10,222
-Yes.
-Way to go.

334
00:23:10,305 --> 00:23:11,598
He's so young.

335
00:23:11,723 --> 00:23:14,476
I live with an old man,
so my lover should be a young one.

336
00:23:15,143 --> 00:23:16,520
-Don't you think so?
-Of course.

337
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:18,814
Just like how we like new cars.

338
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:20,816
Be careful not to get caught.

339
00:23:22,692 --> 00:23:24,778
She says that her husband isn't cheating.

340
00:23:25,987 --> 00:23:26,863
Is that true?

341
00:23:27,781 --> 00:23:31,451
I guess it was just a rumor.

342
00:23:32,202 --> 00:23:34,579
He doesn't seem like a guy
who would cheat on his wife.

343
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:39,459
You should look out for your husband too.

344
00:23:40,168 --> 00:23:42,212
No man should ever be trusted
in this world.

345
00:23:42,546 --> 00:23:44,923
Especially

346
00:23:45,465 --> 00:23:46,758
the husbands.

347
00:23:53,431 --> 00:23:56,143
I said that there's another video.

348
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:59,396
Then? Was she shocked?

349
00:23:59,896 --> 00:24:00,730
Yes.

350
00:24:01,231 --> 00:24:03,358
She definitely seemed a little shocked.

351
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:06,278
But we don't have another video.
What do we do?

352
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:10,574
Now I know the feeling of detectives

353
00:24:10,657 --> 00:24:13,785
who know who the suspect is,
but doesn't have proof.

354
00:24:17,205 --> 00:24:20,917
This morning, a friend told me
that my husband is cheating.

355
00:24:21,042 --> 00:24:24,838
And the housekeeper told me she thinks
he doesn't go cycling every morning.

356
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:28,592
When you put that together,

357
00:24:28,675 --> 00:24:30,969
that means your husband
is cheating on you in the morning.

358
00:24:39,394 --> 00:24:40,312
No way.

359
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:04,628
This is coming off.
It's not sticky enough.

360
00:25:04,878 --> 00:25:09,174
People normally don't wear this
upside down and shake around.

361
00:25:11,051 --> 00:25:12,636
That's true.

362
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:14,554
Yes?

363
00:25:19,935 --> 00:25:20,810
I'll leave.

364
00:25:21,311 --> 00:25:24,272
You must have urgent matters.

365
00:25:24,481 --> 00:25:25,482
Yes.

366
00:25:43,124 --> 00:25:44,918
You don't answer my calls.

367
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:46,795
Why did you call?

368
00:25:47,587 --> 00:25:51,091
-I am sorry about yesterday.
-Go away. I have nothing to say to you.

369
00:25:51,925 --> 00:25:53,426
-Sorry.
-Hey.

370
00:25:54,511 --> 00:25:56,179
There's something you need to know.

371
00:25:56,429 --> 00:25:59,182
I'm not insanely in love with you.

372
00:25:59,557 --> 00:26:02,894
If you pull something like that off again,
it's goodbye.

373
00:26:05,563 --> 00:26:06,481
Am I

374
00:26:07,899 --> 00:26:11,069
just a hookup to you?

375
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:15,156
Give me money then.
At least, I'll get something out of it.

376
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:17,284
Then, I'll get over you.

377
00:26:18,368 --> 00:26:20,036
What kind of person do you think I am?

378
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:22,706
You were my love and destiny.

379
00:26:25,125 --> 00:26:26,209
Me too.

380
00:26:28,044 --> 00:26:29,087
Who said you weren't?

381
00:26:29,713 --> 00:26:31,840
Let stop seeing each other for a while.

382
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:34,175
I don't think
we're in the same emotional page.

383
00:26:40,890 --> 00:26:41,850
Ma'am.

384
00:26:42,809 --> 00:26:45,645
Hello, Manager Park. You must have
a lot of work these days.

385
00:26:46,271 --> 00:26:48,773
It's the same as usual.

386
00:26:48,857 --> 00:26:51,276
-Is he inside?
-He's with a visitor right now,

387
00:26:51,359 --> 00:26:53,069
I'll go and tell him.

388
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:56,406
I think he was

389
00:26:56,698 --> 00:26:58,491
in a serious discussion.

390
00:26:59,534 --> 00:27:00,535
Okay then.

391
00:27:15,216 --> 00:27:17,594
Ms. Woo is here now!

392
00:27:19,054 --> 00:27:22,349
Hide. Go under the sofa.

393
00:27:22,432 --> 00:27:23,391
-Wait.
-Hurry!

394
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:25,310
Get underneath.

395
00:27:26,061 --> 00:27:28,563
Why won't this open?

396
00:27:28,897 --> 00:27:30,982
-Where did she go?
-Desk!

397
00:27:31,066 --> 00:27:32,442
All right. Hurry. Go!

398
00:27:41,993 --> 00:27:43,828
The guest has left.

399
00:27:44,746 --> 00:27:46,498
-You can come in, ma'am.
-Okay.

400
00:27:50,251 --> 00:27:51,086
This...

401
00:27:55,382 --> 00:27:57,175
OFFICE OF EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR

402
00:28:00,512 --> 00:28:02,263
Welcome. What's the matter?

403
00:28:02,472 --> 00:28:03,932
I want to have lunch with you.

404
00:28:04,099 --> 00:28:05,975
Lunch sounds great! Very good!

405
00:28:07,394 --> 00:28:08,895
Why are you in such a good mood?

406
00:28:10,313 --> 00:28:13,191
Because you are here,

407
00:28:13,608 --> 00:28:14,776
of course.

408
00:28:28,248 --> 00:28:30,750
Do you want to stay outside
until I wrap things up?

409
00:28:30,834 --> 00:28:32,877
Why? I can just wait here.

410
00:28:33,002 --> 00:28:33,920
Really?

411
00:28:35,672 --> 00:28:36,798
You can indeed.

412
00:28:37,924 --> 00:28:39,175
I thought you were going to finish.

413
00:28:40,009 --> 00:28:42,554
I'm starving. Let's go.

414
00:28:42,887 --> 00:28:44,097
Let's go.

415
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:46,433
-What do you want to eat?
-I...

416
00:28:46,641 --> 00:28:49,310
I'll buy you something delicious.

417
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:54,983
Mr. Park, I'll come back after lunch.

418
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:55,984
Okay.

419
00:28:57,277 --> 00:29:00,572
And as for the adhesion,
I think it is good enough.

420
00:29:00,697 --> 00:29:02,907
If we make it stickier,
it would be too sticky.

421
00:29:06,369 --> 00:29:08,288
Have a nice lunch.

422
00:29:25,847 --> 00:29:28,683
Mr. Chairman, you're walking fine.

423
00:29:30,226 --> 00:29:32,896
You'll soon be running around.

424
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:36,357
I'm doing well, right?

425
00:29:38,193 --> 00:29:39,235
Astonishingly well.

426
00:29:40,695 --> 00:29:44,157
We should call it a day. Let's go.

427
00:29:45,033 --> 00:29:46,284
What a joke.

428
00:29:47,243 --> 00:29:48,203
Good for you.

429
00:29:50,288 --> 00:29:51,331
This is spicy.

430
00:29:52,874 --> 00:29:54,918
Did you get medicine from Dr. Jang?

431
00:29:55,251 --> 00:29:56,085
What?

432
00:29:57,337 --> 00:29:58,421
What kind of medicine?

433
00:30:00,131 --> 00:30:03,259
-Do you mean Balporin?
-Seeing you surprised makes me suspicious.

434
00:30:03,468 --> 00:30:05,053
Why did you ask for such medicine?

435
00:30:05,762 --> 00:30:07,972
Dr. Jang recommended it to me.

436
00:30:08,181 --> 00:30:10,141
You know how much I like medicine.
That's why I tried...

437
00:30:10,225 --> 00:30:12,727
Then, why do people around Dr. Jang

438
00:30:12,811 --> 00:30:15,897
think that you are cheating?

439
00:30:16,022 --> 00:30:18,149
And why are people telling me this?

440
00:30:18,358 --> 00:30:21,027
What have you been up to?

441
00:30:21,194 --> 00:30:22,904
I was just a joke.

442
00:30:23,321 --> 00:30:25,573
I shouldn't hang out with people
who don't have a sense of humor.

443
00:30:25,657 --> 00:30:28,284
You shouldn't joke around with
stuff like that.

444
00:30:28,368 --> 00:30:31,454
I'm sorry. You must have been worried.

445
00:30:31,788 --> 00:30:33,706
Not worried. Just embarrassed.

446
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:36,918
Even if I did cheat, how could I
tell people something like that?

447
00:30:37,126 --> 00:30:40,004
You're certainly capable of doing so
since you're out of control at times.

448
00:30:40,755 --> 00:30:44,342
A-jin, I have only one woman
in my world and that's you.

449
00:30:44,801 --> 00:30:46,094
Are there two suns in this world?

450
00:30:46,219 --> 00:30:49,889
There's only one sun in this world.

451
00:30:50,056 --> 00:30:52,600
You're my sunshine, all right?

452
00:30:52,934 --> 00:30:53,935
What's with you?

453
00:30:54,227 --> 00:30:55,603
From now on,

454
00:30:55,937 --> 00:30:59,023
I'll buy medicine
from a certified pharmacy.

455
00:30:59,107 --> 00:31:01,401
You're out of control again.
Are you joking again?

456
00:31:01,484 --> 00:31:05,071
Okay. I'll behave from now on.

457
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:07,782
-Don't embarrass Ji-hu.
-Okay, ma'am.

458
00:31:15,832 --> 00:31:18,293
Should I just live here?

459
00:31:19,085 --> 00:31:20,128
Go home now!

460
00:31:20,295 --> 00:31:22,046
I can't. I won't!

461
00:31:23,172 --> 00:31:24,757
Promise me your inheritance, and I will.

462
00:31:24,841 --> 00:31:26,050
This brat...

463
00:31:26,134 --> 00:31:29,178
Dad, I need money.

464
00:31:29,262 --> 00:31:31,723
My husband lost it all.

465
00:31:32,098 --> 00:31:34,267
If I want to divorce and go my own way...

466
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:36,728
Enough! I won't give you a penny!

467
00:31:36,811 --> 00:31:40,106
Money should go to those
who can take care of it.

468
00:31:40,273 --> 00:31:41,566
It isn't worth a shit

469
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:43,860
to those who waste it like you.

470
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:45,278
I won't give you a penny.

471
00:31:45,737 --> 00:31:47,655
What? Did you say, "shit"?

472
00:32:00,168 --> 00:32:02,253
If she gets married,

473
00:32:02,879 --> 00:32:04,714
I'd have to call her "Ma'am," right?

474
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:09,302
Then, Ms. Woo would have to
call her "Mother."

475
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:12,138
They say that you never know
what tomorrow may bring.

476
00:32:12,388 --> 00:32:14,515
What if she really marries
the chairman of Daesung Pulp?

477
00:32:15,016 --> 00:32:16,309
That could be.

478
00:32:16,726 --> 00:32:19,437
-Is there a way to stop the marriage?
-No.

479
00:32:21,606 --> 00:32:22,607
Thank you.

480
00:32:23,149 --> 00:32:24,400
How old was she again?

481
00:32:25,151 --> 00:32:28,071
Six years younger than me.
So, she's 45 years old.

482
00:32:28,696 --> 00:32:32,617
Then, she's probably fertile.
What if she gets pregnant?

483
00:32:33,034 --> 00:32:34,202
No way.

484
00:32:34,827 --> 00:32:36,621
Can Mr. Chairman...

485
00:32:38,289 --> 00:32:40,583
He probably could.
That's probably why he's getting married.

486
00:32:41,668 --> 00:32:43,086
I don't think he could.

487
00:32:45,004 --> 00:32:46,339
It's already up.

488
00:33:59,037 --> 00:33:59,871
What?

489
00:34:10,631 --> 00:34:13,926
You've been recording a video of me
eating, right? Stop it already.

490
00:34:20,391 --> 00:34:22,560
I saw someone lurking around our house.

491
00:34:22,769 --> 00:34:24,937
I wondered who it was at first,
then remembered

492
00:34:25,021 --> 00:34:27,023
it was the man
from the video sent by A-jin.

493
00:34:28,316 --> 00:34:30,777
How kind of him to walk

494
00:34:31,027 --> 00:34:33,988
in front of the security camera, right?

495
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:37,116
I should call the security services
right away.

496
00:34:50,963 --> 00:34:54,008
Hey. What were you doing,
you dumb bastard?

497
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:56,094
Why didn't you answer my calls?

498
00:34:58,262 --> 00:35:00,264
I told you not to call me.

499
00:35:00,556 --> 00:35:02,016
This is an untraceable phone.

500
00:35:03,518 --> 00:35:07,522
I told you no calls or texts are allowed.

501
00:35:07,688 --> 00:35:09,148
I heard that there was another video.

502
00:35:10,316 --> 00:35:11,859
It's been keeping me on edge.

503
00:35:11,984 --> 00:35:15,696
Is that why you revealed your face
to the security camera, you idiot?

504
00:35:17,281 --> 00:35:20,535
If you get caught, tell them.

505
00:35:21,661 --> 00:35:22,578
What?

506
00:35:23,079 --> 00:35:25,665
-That Ms. Park told you to do it.
-What?

507
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:28,751
If you do, I'll give you
that fitness center you wanted.

508
00:35:29,043 --> 00:35:30,294
That's not fair.

509
00:35:30,461 --> 00:35:32,630
Do you want to tell them that I did it?

510
00:35:32,713 --> 00:35:35,508
Then, we both go down.

511
00:35:35,591 --> 00:35:37,969
Tell them that it was Ms. Park.
They will stop the investigation.

512
00:35:38,052 --> 00:35:40,012
Use your brain, you punk.

513
00:35:40,763 --> 00:35:43,266
This will end by simply making her
leave the house.

514
00:35:46,102 --> 00:35:49,355
And get rid of that phone right away.

515
00:35:50,064 --> 00:35:53,109
If there are records that we spoke
on the phone, we'll be screwed.

516
00:35:58,781 --> 00:36:00,783
That's him. The man in the video.

517
00:36:01,409 --> 00:36:03,286
Can you focus on his face?

518
00:36:03,828 --> 00:36:04,745
Yes.

519
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:15,256
Do you know him?

520
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:18,593
No, but he does look familiar.

521
00:36:24,765 --> 00:36:26,058
I can't remember where I saw him.

522
00:36:37,695 --> 00:36:38,779
You draw well.

523
00:36:40,281 --> 00:36:41,616
JAE-SEOK

524
00:36:43,534 --> 00:36:44,452
Hello?

525
00:36:45,453 --> 00:36:46,495
Why did you call?

526
00:36:47,455 --> 00:36:48,497
I'm not interested.

527
00:36:50,833 --> 00:36:52,710
I am teaching your daughter
how to draw. Why?

528
00:36:54,754 --> 00:36:56,422
You don't need to come. We're not at home.

529
00:37:02,929 --> 00:37:05,723
Ji-hu. I know you're very good, but look.

530
00:37:05,806 --> 00:37:07,600
The basics of drawing
a landscape are trees.

531
00:37:07,725 --> 00:37:09,769
The ratio should be three to two.

532
00:37:09,852 --> 00:37:13,481
So, if you divide it into five areas,
make the ratio three to two.

533
00:37:13,648 --> 00:37:16,025
Color it with bright and light colors
as a base color...

534
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:19,695
Why? Is there something on my face?

535
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:22,198
Who was on the phone just now?

536
00:37:23,366 --> 00:37:24,533
Why?

537
00:37:24,742 --> 00:37:27,119
Because you seem happy all of a sudden.

538
00:37:28,996 --> 00:37:30,998
Three to two...

539
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:50,059
JAE-SEOK

540
00:38:06,701 --> 00:38:10,246
I bought two. One for your father-in-law's
and one for your house.

541
00:38:11,872 --> 00:38:15,459
Ji-hu is in art class.
I'll bring her home after she finishes.

542
00:38:19,714 --> 00:38:22,008
-You're here.
-Yes. You seem busy.

543
00:38:23,259 --> 00:38:24,135
Hey.

544
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:27,388
I'll be waiting on that bench.

545
00:38:32,059 --> 00:38:35,062
You can color it, can you?
If you want to make it brighter,

546
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:38,274
just use more water
instead of white paint. Okay?

547
00:38:51,245 --> 00:38:53,581
Why are you painting outside in the cold?

548
00:38:53,664 --> 00:38:57,251
You can paint inside
with two apples on a table.

549
00:38:58,586 --> 00:39:00,338
Are you still angry at me?

550
00:39:00,755 --> 00:39:03,341
I told you that I'm sorry.

551
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:07,595
There's a camel!

552
00:39:10,473 --> 00:39:11,432
It's not funny?

553
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:15,561
There is a monkey too!

554
00:39:18,814 --> 00:39:20,649
Is that funny to you?

555
00:39:41,212 --> 00:39:43,172
What's that?

556
00:39:49,136 --> 00:39:51,597
An unpredictable future is worrisome.

557
00:39:56,602 --> 00:39:58,854
You don't know what you will discover.

558
00:40:07,113 --> 00:40:09,156
You don't know what will happen.

559
00:40:13,619 --> 00:40:15,663
Your husband is seeing another woman.

560
00:40:18,165 --> 00:40:20,751
You don't know what is real or fake.

561
00:40:23,796 --> 00:40:25,714
DIAGNOSIS
GYEONG-HUI OH

562
00:40:25,798 --> 00:40:28,592
BRUISING OF FACE AND CHEST
SPRAINING OF SPINE

563
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:34,390
You don't know what you will end up doing

564
00:40:35,015 --> 00:40:37,184
at that time.

565
00:41:21,187 --> 00:41:23,272
As you come up, stretch!

566
00:41:27,985 --> 00:41:28,861
Hello?

567
00:41:29,028 --> 00:41:32,364
Jin-hee, I found out
who that man in the video is.

568
00:41:33,032 --> 00:41:34,200
I found out who he is.

569
00:41:34,825 --> 00:41:35,826
I'll talk to you later.

570
00:41:58,724 --> 00:42:00,851
Ji-hu, aren't you listening to music?

571
00:42:04,563 --> 00:42:06,232
Why are you staring at me like that?

572
00:42:06,524 --> 00:42:07,733
Dad, are you cheating on Mom?

573
00:42:17,368 --> 00:42:20,246
SEOUL GANGNAM POLICE STATION

574
00:42:21,997 --> 00:42:23,791
Who beat you up like that?

575
00:42:25,876 --> 00:42:29,505
Someone came from the shop and did this.

576
00:42:30,756 --> 00:42:34,593
He could be the same person
who attacked your husband.

577
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:35,594
Yes.

578
00:42:36,178 --> 00:42:40,391
But why didn't he attack you the same?

579
00:42:41,642 --> 00:42:44,395
I screamed and he fled.

580
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:48,232
There are security cameras
everywhere these days.

581
00:42:48,774 --> 00:42:51,068
I'm sure we can find him easily.

582
00:42:51,235 --> 00:42:54,613
There were no security cameras
in the area where I was attacked.

583
00:42:55,322 --> 00:42:56,156
Pardon?

584
00:42:56,282 --> 00:42:59,076
Don't you think I'd know that already?

585
00:43:09,753 --> 00:43:10,796
Hello.

586
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:12,631
Hello.

587
00:43:12,923 --> 00:43:13,966
Let's talk.

588
00:43:15,384 --> 00:43:16,218
Okay.

589
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:04,683
Let's take a look at the security
camera footage of this morning.

590
00:44:05,142 --> 00:44:07,144
The police already took it, ma'am.

591
00:44:07,227 --> 00:44:09,688
No, not that one.

592
00:44:10,147 --> 00:44:11,815
The one in the elevator.

593
00:44:16,403 --> 00:44:19,740
I need the video of the person
who attacked me.

594
00:44:25,704 --> 00:44:28,123
Don't show this to the police.

595
00:44:28,874 --> 00:44:30,417
I will keep this for myself.

596
00:44:32,503 --> 00:44:35,631
It will only distract them
from the investigation.

597
00:44:42,554 --> 00:44:43,847
Have a drink.

598
00:44:44,306 --> 00:44:47,976
ADMINISTRATION OFFICE

599
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:54,650
-Are you all right?
-Yes.

600
00:44:55,192 --> 00:44:56,693
Who did it?

601
00:44:58,070 --> 00:44:59,405
Wasn't it you?

602
00:45:00,239 --> 00:45:01,240
Why would I do such a thing?

603
00:45:01,323 --> 00:45:04,034
You told me that you would kill him

604
00:45:04,118 --> 00:45:05,536
if he lays a hand on me.

605
00:45:06,328 --> 00:45:08,747
Yes, but it wasn't me.

606
00:45:09,915 --> 00:45:11,583
So, it wasn't you.

607
00:45:14,128 --> 00:45:16,880
That bastard must have a lot of enemies.

608
00:45:17,798 --> 00:45:18,924
Good.

609
00:45:19,508 --> 00:45:20,801
Let's go.

610
00:45:22,469 --> 00:45:25,097
I don't want to go home today.

611
00:45:32,729 --> 00:45:34,064
It was me, ma'am.

612
00:45:35,357 --> 00:45:37,359
I was so worried that I visited the place.

613
00:45:38,986 --> 00:45:39,903
Sorry.

614
00:45:42,906 --> 00:45:45,909
-You should be totally honest with me.
-Of course.

615
00:45:46,785 --> 00:45:47,828
I will not lie.

616
00:45:48,370 --> 00:45:50,664
-Who told you to do it?
-Bok-ja Park.

617
00:45:52,791 --> 00:45:55,127
She wanted Bok-ja Park to leave the house.

618
00:45:56,253 --> 00:45:57,629
She despised her.

619
00:45:58,088 --> 00:46:00,382
-Who did?
-The wife of Mr. Chairman's oldest son.

620
00:46:01,383 --> 00:46:02,217
The professor.

621
00:46:06,555 --> 00:46:07,514
So,

622
00:46:09,141 --> 00:46:12,269
you're saying that Ju-mi
told you to do this?

623
00:46:12,811 --> 00:46:13,729
Yes.

624
00:46:14,605 --> 00:46:18,734
She wanted me to hurt Bok-ja Park,
not Mr. Chairman.

625
00:46:21,653 --> 00:46:23,238
Do you expect me to believe you?

626
00:46:23,363 --> 00:46:25,866
She had much hatred towards Bok-ja Park.

627
00:46:25,949 --> 00:46:26,867
She even

628
00:46:29,077 --> 00:46:31,330
told me that she wanted her dead.

629
00:46:33,165 --> 00:46:34,541
How do you know Ju-mi?

630
00:46:34,708 --> 00:46:38,128
She came by one time
because of Mr. Chairman's therapy.

631
00:46:40,130 --> 00:46:41,048
That's true.

632
00:46:42,007 --> 00:46:43,926
She came by during vacation.

633
00:46:46,845 --> 00:46:48,138
Sorry, ma'am.

634
00:46:49,348 --> 00:46:50,891
I urgently needed money.

635
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:52,643
She told me

636
00:46:53,894 --> 00:46:56,313
to take this secret to the grave.

637
00:46:57,648 --> 00:46:59,024
I am terribly sorry.

638
00:47:04,530 --> 00:47:06,490
-Enjoy.
-Thank you.

639
00:47:07,407 --> 00:47:08,951
Ji-hu, let's eat.

640
00:47:11,870 --> 00:47:15,207
The art teacher helps me with my work.

641
00:47:15,666 --> 00:47:19,294
That's why we've become close,
but it's nothing inappropriate.

642
00:47:20,003 --> 00:47:22,256
Dad. Have you read Hansel and Gretel?

643
00:47:22,381 --> 00:47:24,424
I think so, but I don't remember.

644
00:47:24,550 --> 00:47:27,594
Do you think
that their stepmother abandoned them?

645
00:47:27,678 --> 00:47:31,348
No. The real bad person is their dad.

646
00:47:31,765 --> 00:47:35,477
The stepmother tells him
to abandon his children, so he does.

647
00:47:35,769 --> 00:47:37,646
He's a really bad person.

648
00:47:38,063 --> 00:47:40,566
But I bet he wasn't originally
a bad person.

649
00:47:40,983 --> 00:47:42,943
The stepmother made him like that.

650
00:47:43,318 --> 00:47:45,821
Men in fairytales are seduced

651
00:47:46,238 --> 00:47:49,825
not by good women, but by evil women.

652
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:51,952
Same happened to Cinderella's dad.

653
00:47:52,286 --> 00:47:56,248
Ji-hu, I am totally different
from those assholes.

654
00:47:56,415 --> 00:48:00,127
-Dad is...
-I will not forgive anyone

655
00:48:00,335 --> 00:48:02,087
who breaks Mom's heart.

656
00:48:02,629 --> 00:48:03,964
Even if it is you.

657
00:48:19,646 --> 00:48:20,772
I love you, Dad.

658
00:48:24,026 --> 00:48:24,901
Me too.

659
00:48:52,429 --> 00:48:55,015
-Yes, Ju-mi.
-A-jin, how did it go?

660
00:48:55,474 --> 00:48:56,600
Did you find out who it was?

661
00:48:58,477 --> 00:48:59,478
About that...

662
00:49:01,021 --> 00:49:03,732
-No, I have no idea.
-Then, you should call the police.

663
00:49:04,066 --> 00:49:05,233
Simple as that.

664
00:49:06,860 --> 00:49:09,154
If rumors spread and become news,

665
00:49:09,237 --> 00:49:10,614
it will be bad for the company's image.

666
00:49:10,989 --> 00:49:12,991
I'll be home soon. Wait for me.

667
00:49:14,284 --> 00:49:15,160
Jin-hee,

668
00:49:15,619 --> 00:49:17,829
Ms. Woo is worried enough.

669
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:19,581
Don't tell her and pretend that

670
00:49:20,248 --> 00:49:21,416
you didn't see anything.

671
00:49:22,084 --> 00:49:25,587
How can I pretend? She needs to know.

672
00:49:25,712 --> 00:49:28,256
Sometimes, things are better kept
as secret.

673
00:49:28,548 --> 00:49:32,386
The atmosphere here is as if a
nuclear bomb dropped in this household.

674
00:49:33,053 --> 00:49:35,722
Also, you don't know for sure.

675
00:49:36,306 --> 00:49:38,850
Physical contact and laughing doesn't mean
that they're having an affair.

676
00:49:39,393 --> 00:49:41,395
That wasn't all.

677
00:49:41,603 --> 00:49:42,437
What?

678
00:49:43,313 --> 00:49:46,900
He always picked up Ji-hu
after her art class.

679
00:49:47,025 --> 00:49:50,570
Also, he told me not to tell Ms. Woo.

680
00:49:51,071 --> 00:49:52,030
Is that true?

681
00:49:53,657 --> 00:49:56,618
So, that's where he went in the morning
instead of cycling.

682
00:49:56,743 --> 00:49:58,120
I can't believe him.

683
00:49:58,578 --> 00:49:59,955
There's no trustworthy man.

684
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:03,417
Their penises are what controls men.

685
00:50:03,917 --> 00:50:06,086
We need to chop them off.

686
00:50:07,713 --> 00:50:09,923
Well, about telling her...

687
00:50:15,387 --> 00:50:17,806
-Ms. Woo.
-You're here. What about Ji-hu?

688
00:50:18,265 --> 00:50:20,475
-Your husband took her.
-Okay.

689
00:50:23,103 --> 00:50:25,397
Did you want to tell me something?

690
00:50:26,314 --> 00:50:28,108
No. I figured it out.

691
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:29,276
What was it?

692
00:50:30,527 --> 00:50:34,364
The video.
I filmed Ji-hu playing the violin.

693
00:50:34,531 --> 00:50:37,993
All right. Eat dinner together
and go home. I need some rest.

694
00:50:39,244 --> 00:50:43,415
You told me that you found
the man in the video.

695
00:50:43,707 --> 00:50:44,583
Who was it?

696
00:51:18,533 --> 00:51:19,868
Seems like you're having a tea party.

697
00:51:20,410 --> 00:51:21,745
You're back.

698
00:51:21,828 --> 00:51:23,705
Enjoy. Let's go, Ji-hu.

699
00:51:26,041 --> 00:51:26,875
Go on.

700
00:51:41,139 --> 00:51:42,390
Is the problem solved?

701
00:51:43,016 --> 00:51:44,893
Yes. I think it is.

702
00:51:45,560 --> 00:51:46,561
In the meantime,

703
00:51:48,146 --> 00:51:52,108
don't ever call me until I call you.

704
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:56,029
If it's utterly important,
call me with someone else's phone.

705
00:51:56,488 --> 00:51:58,073
How will you contact me?

706
00:51:59,199 --> 00:52:01,451
I will use someone else's phone too.

707
00:52:02,077 --> 00:52:02,994
Whose phone?

708
00:52:04,162 --> 00:52:05,205
Ms. Park's.

709
00:52:08,166 --> 00:52:09,084
Where are you going?

710
00:52:09,835 --> 00:52:11,253
The place I used to live.

711
00:52:11,878 --> 00:52:13,588
I need to bring a few things.

712
00:52:14,464 --> 00:52:16,633
Congratulations on your marriage!

713
00:52:18,635 --> 00:52:19,803
It's still early.

714
00:52:21,596 --> 00:52:22,722
Goodbye,

715
00:52:24,391 --> 00:52:26,810
and wait for my call.

716
00:52:41,116 --> 00:52:42,576
Where is the caregiver?

717
00:52:43,285 --> 00:52:44,619
She went to her hometown.

718
00:52:45,203 --> 00:52:46,121
Did she quit?

719
00:52:48,498 --> 00:52:51,626
We're going to have
a small wedding this weekend.

720
00:52:51,793 --> 00:52:55,505
She went home to say hello

721
00:52:55,630 --> 00:52:57,048
to her relatives.

722
00:52:58,133 --> 00:53:00,886
Dad, are you really going to do this?

723
00:53:01,386 --> 00:53:03,305
Don't you guys want me to be happy?

724
00:53:04,014 --> 00:53:05,765
Then, just give your blessings.

725
00:53:06,099 --> 00:53:08,184
Just the two of us will do the ceremony.

726
00:53:08,435 --> 00:53:09,853
Don't try to stop us.

727
00:53:12,522 --> 00:53:15,942
Anyways, I had to tell you all,

728
00:53:16,484 --> 00:53:17,485
so I did.

729
00:53:18,403 --> 00:53:20,155
I will help you prepare, Father.

730
00:53:25,535 --> 00:53:28,413
What can I do other than to support you?

731
00:53:28,872 --> 00:53:30,332
I'll help you prepare.

732
00:53:31,166 --> 00:53:32,125
You are

733
00:53:32,375 --> 00:53:35,670
quite not like the others.

734
00:53:58,610 --> 00:54:00,362
-Ms. Heo.
-Jin-hee.

735
00:54:00,445 --> 00:54:03,323
-Ms. Woo.
-Why are you here? What's the matter?

736
00:54:04,491 --> 00:54:06,534
-We need to talk.
-Okay. Let's go in.

737
00:54:06,618 --> 00:54:09,496
No. Let's talk outside.
Just the two of us.

738
00:54:09,871 --> 00:54:10,705
Okay.

739
00:54:12,332 --> 00:54:13,208
Let's go.

740
00:54:15,919 --> 00:54:17,671
What's the big deal?

741
00:54:18,505 --> 00:54:21,132
You look so tired.

742
00:54:22,509 --> 00:54:24,302
Things don't happen the way I want it to.

743
00:54:24,719 --> 00:54:26,596
Father will proceed with the marriage.

744
00:54:27,764 --> 00:54:29,099
Who can stop him.

745
00:54:29,683 --> 00:54:31,267
Just let it be.

746
00:54:31,726 --> 00:54:32,978
Tell me already.

747
00:54:33,103 --> 00:54:34,479
What's the matter?

748
00:54:36,106 --> 00:54:37,107
Ms. Woo,

749
00:54:38,066 --> 00:54:40,860
your husband is suspicious.

750
00:54:42,237 --> 00:54:43,405
-The thing is...
-Stop!

751
00:54:47,325 --> 00:54:48,451
I'll look into it.

752
00:54:50,078 --> 00:54:52,539
I don't want to hear it from someone else.

753
00:54:54,207 --> 00:54:56,001
I'll look into it,

754
00:54:56,918 --> 00:54:59,963
and if I am mistaken...

755
00:55:00,255 --> 00:55:02,757
Okay. You can figure it out.

756
00:55:02,882 --> 00:55:04,551
I'll tell you if things go wrong.

757
00:55:07,053 --> 00:55:07,887
Okay.

758
00:55:08,722 --> 00:55:09,597
All right.

759
00:55:11,349 --> 00:55:13,935
Cheer up, Ms. Woo.

760
00:55:16,938 --> 00:55:17,814
Okay.

761
00:55:18,523 --> 00:55:21,192
Is that what you wanted to tell me?

762
00:55:23,653 --> 00:55:24,612
Thank you.

763
00:55:27,532 --> 00:55:30,493
You hesitated because of how I may feel.

764
00:55:31,703 --> 00:55:34,122
-Yes.
-I appreciate that.

765
00:55:35,290 --> 00:55:36,624
I know how that feels.

766
00:57:21,146 --> 00:57:23,898
JEONG-A, BEER AND LIQUOR

767
00:57:33,408 --> 00:57:34,784
-My gosh.
-What a surprise.

768
00:57:36,661 --> 00:57:37,787
Is it you, Jeong-a?

769
00:57:39,539 --> 00:57:40,748
Cho-hui!

770
00:57:42,083 --> 00:57:43,042
-My gosh.
-Hey!

771
00:57:45,587 --> 00:57:48,089
Hey, it's been a while.

772
00:57:49,299 --> 00:57:51,759
You look the same.

773
00:57:51,843 --> 00:57:54,429
Nonsense. I've gotten older.

774
00:57:54,804 --> 00:57:56,848
But you look really good.

775
00:57:57,098 --> 00:57:58,057
Who's the guy?

776
00:57:59,976 --> 00:58:02,479
-Let's have a drink.
-Before a meal?

777
00:58:02,604 --> 00:58:04,689
-Have you eaten yet?
-I don't need food.

778
00:58:04,856 --> 00:58:06,691
Just bring some pollack and soju.

779
00:58:07,108 --> 00:58:10,111
Here it is.

780
00:58:13,281 --> 00:58:14,324
Smells good.

781
00:58:15,533 --> 00:58:16,826
What have you been up to these days?

782
00:58:18,244 --> 00:58:20,788
I am getting married.

783
00:58:21,289 --> 00:58:23,666
Is that so? Good for you!

784
00:58:24,209 --> 00:58:25,710
He must be rich.

785
00:58:26,878 --> 00:58:27,712
Yes.

786
00:58:29,172 --> 00:58:31,174
I am tired of working here.

787
00:58:34,093 --> 00:58:35,053
I...

788
00:58:36,346 --> 00:58:38,139
tried to find you.

789
00:58:39,599 --> 00:58:41,893
You're the only one

790
00:58:42,560 --> 00:58:43,937
that I can trust.

791
00:58:46,272 --> 00:58:48,691
You're the only one who knows

792
00:58:48,775 --> 00:58:51,110
that my real name is Bang-soon Cheon,
not Jeong-a Lee.

793
00:58:51,486 --> 00:58:53,988
And you were the only one who knows

794
00:58:54,489 --> 00:58:57,408
that my real name is Bok-ja Park,
not Cho-hui Park.

795
00:58:58,243 --> 00:59:00,620
But I live by my real name nowadays.

796
00:59:00,828 --> 00:59:01,829
Damn.

797
00:59:03,206 --> 00:59:05,250
We must be tied by fate.

798
00:59:05,375 --> 00:59:07,418
Who knew we'd meet again?

799
00:59:09,796 --> 00:59:11,047
I hope we can

800
00:59:11,464 --> 00:59:14,801
see each other more often.

801
00:59:53,381 --> 00:59:54,382
Dad.

802
00:59:59,804 --> 01:00:00,763
Dad.

803
01:00:04,392 --> 01:00:05,435
Dad.

804
01:00:08,354 --> 01:00:09,397
Dad.

805
01:00:11,941 --> 01:00:13,026
Dad.

806
01:00:16,738 --> 01:00:18,114
What do I do?

807
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:22,327
Dad.

808
01:00:22,744 --> 01:00:24,287
What do I do?

809
01:00:28,416 --> 01:00:30,168
Dad.

810
01:00:34,839 --> 01:00:36,007
Dad.

811
01:00:55,276 --> 01:00:58,154
He told me that I am his sun.

812
01:00:58,363 --> 01:00:59,697
He'd never stress me out.

813
01:01:00,031 --> 01:01:01,032
Cheer up.

814
01:01:01,491 --> 01:01:02,575
This shall pass too.

815
01:01:06,829 --> 01:01:09,749
We need to stop her
from taking control over Father.

816
01:01:09,832 --> 01:01:11,084
It's your prenuptial agreement.

817
01:01:11,167 --> 01:01:15,004
You told me that you only care about
protecting Mr. Chairman, didn't you?

818
01:01:15,380 --> 01:01:17,173
Tell Jae-gu to come back.

819
01:01:17,256 --> 01:01:19,717
He's the only one
who can trample Bok-ja Park.

820
01:01:19,801 --> 01:01:23,096
It looks like my dad is marrying
one special lady.

821
01:01:23,179 --> 01:01:25,139
Get lost! Get out of my sight.

822
01:01:25,932 --> 01:01:27,016
I feel insecure though.

823
01:01:27,266 --> 01:01:30,436
I'm just not sure if I deserve

824
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:32,021
to be this happy.

825
01:01:33,523 --> 01:01:36,109
She's a new maid who'll be working for us.

826
01:01:36,234 --> 01:01:37,985
Say hello. This is the younger son's wife.

827
01:01:38,069 --> 01:01:41,739
Ms. Woo, whose orders should I follow
from now on?

828
01:01:42,532 --> 01:01:46,035
From now on, I will make all decisions.

829
01:01:46,119 --> 01:01:48,121
