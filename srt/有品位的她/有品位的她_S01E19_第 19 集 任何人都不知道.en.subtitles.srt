1
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:28,838
Why are you so late?

2
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:31,257
The forensic team is already here,
so go on in. Hurry up.

3
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:35,887
It rained yesterday but...

4
00:01:39,682 --> 00:01:40,683
it's too clean.

5
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:03,957
Will

6
00:02:42,787 --> 00:02:45,456
I won't buy the company back.

7
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:48,293
I don't have anyone around me

8
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:51,629
that can run the company well.

9
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:55,425
Then, we have no choice
but to sell it to Gangil Group.

10
00:03:17,614 --> 00:03:19,282
Let me take you home, sir.

11
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,202
That poor woman.

12
00:03:41,429 --> 00:03:44,098
I died.

13
00:03:48,019 --> 00:03:49,646
THE DAY AFTER BOK-JA PARK DIED

14
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:50,897
Detective Lee.

15
00:03:51,105 --> 00:03:52,523
-Yes.
-I called the security company.

16
00:03:53,024 --> 00:03:55,902
The service for Tae-dong Ahn's house was
canceled 15 days prior to the incident.

17
00:03:56,194 --> 00:03:58,363
-Who canceled it?
-Their record says it was Ju-mi Park.

18
00:03:59,822 --> 00:04:02,242
Ju-mi Park? She's the elder son's wife.

19
00:04:03,868 --> 00:04:05,620
So, there's no
security camera footage to check.

20
00:04:07,455 --> 00:04:09,791
Will

21
00:04:09,999 --> 00:04:12,752
She was definitely killed.
What is this will?

22
00:04:13,044 --> 00:04:15,129
I got Ji-yeong Park's phone records.

23
00:04:17,298 --> 00:04:20,718
The eldest son's wife, Ju-mi Park, was
the last person she spoke to on the phone.

24
00:04:20,885 --> 00:04:24,806
She spoke with Bang-soon Cheon
for a minute and a half before that.

25
00:04:25,014 --> 00:04:27,850
And the last text message she got says,
"Ms. Jo's daughter

26
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:30,228
is hospitalized at Yangheung Hospital
in Gyeonggi Province."

27
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:32,981
Ms. Jo? The woman who ran away?

28
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:35,066
-Who sent it?
-Here.

29
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:37,735
Here, Pung-suk's Kitchen.

30
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:39,070
Pung-suk's Kitchen.

31
00:04:43,032 --> 00:04:44,826
Hey, come on in.

32
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:53,418
Let's talk for a minute.

33
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:10,101
You said that Ms. Bok-ja Park came here

34
00:05:10,184 --> 00:05:12,186
and ordered the blowfish porridge
for Father in person.

35
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:15,398
That's right.

36
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:18,484
Father did like
your blowfish porridge very much.

37
00:05:20,194 --> 00:05:22,613
But he has never had any problem with it
in the past.

38
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:27,201
Why do you think it gave him
such a severe stomachache this time?

39
00:05:27,535 --> 00:05:30,413
The doctor said
that it could have been fatal.

40
00:05:32,123 --> 00:05:33,291
I'm sorry, ma'am.

41
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:36,252
I did my best to prepare the blowfish
to make sure it's safe, but...

42
00:05:37,253 --> 00:05:38,629
Do you think I'll believe that?

43
00:05:39,505 --> 00:05:41,340
You tell me what kind of place
Pung-suk's Kitchen is.

44
00:05:41,549 --> 00:05:45,303
You don't charge customers even when
a tiny fish bone is found in your food.

45
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:49,140
And what? Making porridge without removing
all the poison from the fish

46
00:05:49,223 --> 00:05:50,600
was merely a mistake?

47
00:05:51,476 --> 00:05:54,645
-Ms. Woo.
-Were you really trying to kill Ms. Park?

48
00:05:58,024 --> 00:05:59,317
Ma'am, what are you talking about?

49
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:02,403
I'd never do such a thing with food.

50
00:06:02,653 --> 00:06:04,822
You probably didn't know
that my father-in-law would eat it.

51
00:06:05,323 --> 00:06:06,699
You thought he was still unconscious.

52
00:06:09,285 --> 00:06:11,996
Is this conversation also being bugged
at the moment?

53
00:06:14,957 --> 00:06:17,502
Go to the police station
and confess everything.

54
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:21,672
If you don't, I'll tell everyone
about you selling all the information

55
00:06:22,465 --> 00:06:24,425
that you gather on people in Gangnam.

56
00:06:27,011 --> 00:06:28,137
Ms. Woo, please don't do that.

57
00:06:29,472 --> 00:06:30,723
I'll be doomed if people find out.

58
00:06:32,642 --> 00:06:34,102
Why did you do such a thing?

59
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:35,353
I just...

60
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,190
I just wanted to teach
that woman a lesson.

61
00:06:40,858 --> 00:06:43,277
I know how much poison is needed

62
00:06:43,361 --> 00:06:45,238
to cause a stomachache
or to make it lethal.

63
00:06:45,822 --> 00:06:49,534
I just wanted to show her
that she can suffer

64
00:06:50,326 --> 00:06:53,287
if she messes with me.
I did it as a warning.

65
00:06:55,206 --> 00:06:57,625
As you know, that's all the power I have.

66
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:15,518
A-jin, are you also suspecting
that it was my doing?

67
00:07:17,728 --> 00:07:19,730
I really wanted to change
and become a good person,

68
00:07:22,233 --> 00:07:25,570
but bad things always happen
to me like this.

69
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:34,495
The porridge is from Pung-suk's Kitchen.

70
00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:38,833
The owner of that place has been
recording housekeepers' conversations

71
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,209
that take place there.

72
00:07:40,626 --> 00:07:43,671
Ms. Ji-yeong Park sent this text message
to Ms. A-jin Woo.

73
00:07:43,921 --> 00:07:45,381
I never recorded anything.

74
00:07:45,673 --> 00:07:48,509
I guess people made
such absurd speculation because

75
00:07:48,593 --> 00:07:50,386
my place of business
is like a hangout for so many.

76
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:52,472
Feel free to visit and search the place.

77
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:55,224
All right. Let's move on, then.

78
00:07:57,977 --> 00:07:59,854
You said that you made the porridge
for Chairman Ahn,

79
00:07:59,937 --> 00:08:01,981
but a minute amount of poison
happened to go in it.

80
00:08:02,773 --> 00:08:03,941
-That's right.
-However,

81
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:06,235
Ji-yeong Park did not tell you to do it.

82
00:08:07,111 --> 00:08:07,987
Correct.

83
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:12,033
When we were questioning Bang-soon Cheon,

84
00:08:13,075 --> 00:08:15,786
she said that Ji-yeong Park
must have told you to do it.

85
00:08:17,246 --> 00:08:19,123
Why would she do that?

86
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:22,335
It's obviously because
she'll inherit more money from him

87
00:08:23,252 --> 00:08:24,587
if he dies.

88
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:28,758
Anyway, she never asked me
to do such a thing.

89
00:08:30,384 --> 00:08:33,596
Where were you at the time
of Ji-yeong Park's death on February 28th?

90
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:47,985
What have you done?

91
00:08:49,487 --> 00:08:51,531
What? What's your problem?

92
00:08:51,822 --> 00:08:55,326
Answer me. Did you do that to kill me?

93
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:56,494
You obviously didn't die.

94
00:08:59,288 --> 00:09:00,248
Mr. Chairman

95
00:09:01,123 --> 00:09:03,084
fainted after eating that porridge.

96
00:09:05,586 --> 00:09:06,671
He ate that?

97
00:09:06,754 --> 00:09:10,216
What shall I tell people first? The fact
that someone passed out from your food?

98
00:09:10,299 --> 00:09:13,511
Or, the fact that
you have been eavesdropping

99
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:17,848
on Gangnam people's conversations
through the bugs you have planted here?

100
00:09:17,932 --> 00:09:20,309
Alternatively, I can say both.

101
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:22,812
What will yield faster results?

102
00:09:25,273 --> 00:09:28,985
I don't know how powerful
some of your customers are,

103
00:09:29,318 --> 00:09:33,030
but I know that you've been getting away
with things because they got your back.

104
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:36,701
Nothing happens even when
you're reported for tax evasion.

105
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:39,370
Whoever that has your back
must be a real power broker,

106
00:09:39,996 --> 00:09:41,247
but you're done now.

107
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:45,084
You better turn yourself in

108
00:09:46,168 --> 00:09:47,461
before I report you to the police.

109
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:50,548
The Public Prosecutor General is
my customer. I guess you didn't know that.

110
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:54,468
Then, I'll tell everyone about it

111
00:09:55,052 --> 00:09:58,681
and get Mr. Public Prosecutor General
in trouble as well.

112
00:09:58,764 --> 00:10:01,892
People should know that
the Public Prosecutor General is

113
00:10:02,935 --> 00:10:05,438
a customer of an illegal food business
that has committed tax evasion.

114
00:10:24,373 --> 00:10:27,627
Where were you at the time
of Ji-yeong Park's death on February 28th?

115
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:30,838
I was sleeping at home.

116
00:10:33,341 --> 00:10:35,426
Have it with ramen
when you have night shifts.

117
00:10:35,593 --> 00:10:37,928
Wait, please take this back.
We can't accept things like this...

118
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:40,348
Gosh, what is she thinking?

119
00:10:42,433 --> 00:10:45,019
Mr. Ahn left the hospital
around the time of Ji-yeong Park's death.

120
00:10:45,394 --> 00:10:47,521
He wasn't at the hospital.
I just met his nurse.

121
00:10:48,439 --> 00:10:49,315
What?

122
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:56,280
On the day that Ji-yeong Park died,
you received emergency treatment

123
00:10:56,697 --> 00:10:58,991
at the ER because you passed out
after eating blowfish porridge.

124
00:10:59,617 --> 00:11:00,951
That's what the hospital records say.

125
00:11:01,369 --> 00:11:02,203
Correct.

126
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:04,163
Did you think

127
00:11:04,872 --> 00:11:07,416
that Ji-yeong Park
intentionally gave you the porridge?

128
00:11:10,961 --> 00:11:11,837
Yes, I did.

129
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:16,550
Then, that must have made you very angry.

130
00:11:23,599 --> 00:11:25,643
Yes, to the point that
I wanted to kill her.

131
00:11:27,311 --> 00:11:28,270
So, what happened?

132
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:31,232
When I woke up, I realized that
I was at the hospital. So, I...

133
00:11:38,656 --> 00:11:41,242
It's me, Mr. Kim. I have to go home.

134
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:42,868
Come to the hospital now.

135
00:11:47,289 --> 00:11:50,543
So, I went to the hospital,
but Mr. Ahn wasn't there.

136
00:11:51,085 --> 00:11:52,336
I looked for him for quite a while.

137
00:11:54,338 --> 00:11:55,256
Mr. Ahn.

138
00:11:56,632 --> 00:11:57,550
Mr. Ahn!

139
00:12:02,179 --> 00:12:04,140
I'm here, sir. Where are you now?

140
00:12:04,432 --> 00:12:06,434
He said that
he'd just stay at the hospital,

141
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:07,977
so I went home.

142
00:12:08,811 --> 00:12:12,314
I'm at the hospital now. Just go home.

143
00:12:35,045 --> 00:12:35,921
Father.

144
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:42,178
Why do you think she did it?

145
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:44,847
Why did she try to kill me?

146
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:47,516
No, Father. She didn't.

147
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:51,145
I know that she tried to protect you.

148
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:59,278
THE DAY BOK-JA PARK DIED

149
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:07,953
Meet me now.

150
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:24,845
A-jin, are you also suspecting
that it was my doing?

151
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:33,604
I see.

152
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,399
I...

153
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:42,738
I moved into this house
in order to seduce Mr. Chairman.

154
00:13:44,073 --> 00:13:45,908
Everything was planned beforehand,

155
00:13:46,534 --> 00:13:49,119
and moving into this place
was obviously a part of the plan.

156
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:54,166
I mean, look at this fancy mansion.

157
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:56,168
When else will I

158
00:13:59,463 --> 00:14:00,381
ever get to

159
00:14:02,299 --> 00:14:03,425
live like this?

160
00:14:07,638 --> 00:14:09,014
When I was young,

161
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:12,560
I was so poor.

162
00:14:14,228 --> 00:14:17,356
I even soaked tteokbokki in water
hoping that it'd be more filling.

163
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:20,651
When you soak it in water,

164
00:14:22,069 --> 00:14:23,821
rice cakes of this size

165
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:26,907
become this big.

166
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:35,457
I really

167
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:39,003
wanted to live a decent life.

168
00:14:42,631 --> 00:14:44,550
I wanted a fabulous life

169
00:14:45,801 --> 00:14:47,887
that I could boast about.

170
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:50,639
I wanted to be able
to show off what I had,

171
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:53,058
drive a nice car,

172
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:56,812
and boss people around here and there.

173
00:14:59,356 --> 00:15:02,860
Why are people born
with their social classes

174
00:15:03,777 --> 00:15:07,531
branded onto them like carcasses
with their grades stamped on them?

175
00:15:10,951 --> 00:15:12,077
You see,

176
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:15,915
I just wanted to

177
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:19,710
erase that stigma.

178
00:15:24,381 --> 00:15:26,634
You didn't have to run away
because everything was already yours.

179
00:15:27,509 --> 00:15:28,677
Why did you run away?

180
00:15:31,722 --> 00:15:34,058
I was scared that
someone might steal it from me.

181
00:15:38,687 --> 00:15:39,647
My whole life,

182
00:15:41,523 --> 00:15:43,442
people stole things from me.

183
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:45,319
Even my parents.

184
00:15:46,153 --> 00:15:48,405
God stole them from me.

185
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:53,410
My adoptive parents abandoned me as well.

186
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:57,039
I didn't even steal anything,

187
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:01,126
but I was framed for it and...

188
00:16:04,546 --> 00:16:07,257
I'm one unlucky woman.

189
00:16:14,682 --> 00:16:16,016
That's why I ran away.

190
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:18,727
I didn't want anyone to steal it from me.

191
00:16:31,782 --> 00:16:33,617
I felt bad for Mr. Chairman.

192
00:16:34,868 --> 00:16:36,078
As you know, all of his children

193
00:16:38,038 --> 00:16:41,417
just think of that old man
as their source of money.

194
00:16:42,793 --> 00:16:44,795
That's why...

195
00:16:49,425 --> 00:16:50,884
That's why

196
00:16:52,094 --> 00:16:54,096
I wanted to take

197
00:16:54,763 --> 00:16:56,181
really good care of him.

198
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:01,645
But...

199
00:17:05,232 --> 00:17:06,275
But...

200
00:17:08,485 --> 00:17:09,862
But this happened.

201
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:24,835
I thought she made me eat that thing
to kill me.

202
00:17:25,586 --> 00:17:28,213
I assumed that
she was only after my money.

203
00:17:29,214 --> 00:17:31,550
She'll get the rest of my assets
if I die, you know.

204
00:17:32,134 --> 00:17:35,095
I thought that she sees me as money
and nothing else.

205
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:37,306
Father.

206
00:17:38,015 --> 00:17:40,309
She doesn't want you to die.

207
00:17:48,192 --> 00:17:50,444
It's possible that Bok-ja Park
cooked up such a ruse

208
00:17:51,028 --> 00:17:54,907
in order to kill Chairman Ahn
and get her hands on all of his assets.

209
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:57,826
No, she didn't have any reason to do that.

210
00:17:58,368 --> 00:17:59,620
What do you mean by that?

211
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:03,832
She signed a prenuptial agreement
before they got married.

212
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:06,126
One of the clauses states that

213
00:18:07,127 --> 00:18:09,546
she'll give up her right of inheritance
as his spouse entirely

214
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:11,465
should any unfortunate accident occur.

215
00:18:12,549 --> 00:18:16,011
She'll have no rights
to any of his assets after he dies.

216
00:18:17,221 --> 00:18:20,307
Does Mr. Tae-dong Ahn know about it?

217
00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:25,437
He never mentioned anything about that
when he was here to give his statement.

218
00:18:26,855 --> 00:18:28,273
He found out about it after that.

219
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:33,862
PRENUPTIAL AGREEMENT

220
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:43,580
I had completely

221
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,210
forgotten about this.

222
00:18:54,675 --> 00:18:58,095
Mr. Ahn was not in his hospital room

223
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:00,389
at the time of Ji-yeong Park's death.

224
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:06,311
You and Mr. Jae-seok Ahn are the only ones

225
00:19:06,687 --> 00:19:08,188
that have firm alibis.

226
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:15,696
Ms. Gyeong-ja Jo was the first person
that called us

227
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:17,823
to report Bok-ja Park's death.

228
00:19:17,948 --> 00:19:20,325
I heard that everyone in the family
called her Ms. Jo.

229
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:21,493
That's right.

230
00:19:21,702 --> 00:19:25,122
We have her statement.
It's not related to this case,

231
00:19:25,455 --> 00:19:27,374
but she has been charged with theft.

232
00:19:27,749 --> 00:19:29,751
She brought back
all the jewelry she stole though.

233
00:19:30,752 --> 00:19:33,130
Have you had a chance to check
everything she brought back?

234
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:36,049
Yes, I have.

235
00:19:36,925 --> 00:19:38,135
I'm sorry, ma'am.

236
00:19:39,469 --> 00:19:40,721
I don't even know what to say.

237
00:19:42,306 --> 00:19:43,724
Why did you do such a thing?

238
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:48,395
I needed money because my daughter is ill.

239
00:19:49,313 --> 00:19:50,981
I heard that the family
basically went bankrupt,

240
00:19:52,149 --> 00:19:53,734
and before I even realized
what I was doing...

241
00:19:54,985 --> 00:19:56,236
I'm sorry, ma'am.

242
00:19:57,404 --> 00:19:58,697
Why did you come back?

243
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:04,411
Ms. Park

244
00:20:05,287 --> 00:20:07,164
called me at the hospital

245
00:20:07,748 --> 00:20:09,166
where my daughter is.

246
00:20:10,918 --> 00:20:14,254
She told me to come back and said that
she'd take care of the hospital bill.

247
00:20:18,675 --> 00:20:20,719
She said that she'll forgive me

248
00:20:21,303 --> 00:20:22,930
if I come back,

249
00:20:24,598 --> 00:20:25,849
and that's why I came back.

250
00:20:31,647 --> 00:20:32,648
But...

251
00:21:09,726 --> 00:21:11,687
Please take good care of Father.

252
00:21:12,646 --> 00:21:14,356
-I should get going.
-Ma'am.

253
00:21:15,899 --> 00:21:16,817
Actually,

254
00:21:17,901 --> 00:21:19,945
there's something I need to tell you.

255
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:44,928
Are you sure?

256
00:21:45,637 --> 00:21:47,222
Yes, I saw it.

257
00:21:47,848 --> 00:21:49,433
I saw it with my own two eyes.

258
00:21:49,725 --> 00:21:51,184
Did you tell the police?

259
00:21:52,394 --> 00:21:53,270
No.

260
00:21:53,729 --> 00:21:54,771
Why didn't you tell them?

261
00:21:56,481 --> 00:21:57,399
That's...

262
00:22:00,235 --> 00:22:01,361
Should I tell the police?

263
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:09,536
It probably wasn't her doing.

264
00:22:12,289 --> 00:22:14,499
VICE-CHAIRWOMAN OF DAESUNG PULP,
JI-YEONG PARK

265
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:18,170
I guess A-jin Woo and Jae-seok Ahn
have alibis.

266
00:22:18,503 --> 00:22:20,255
They sure have firm alibis.

267
00:22:22,674 --> 00:22:25,343
THE RESIDENT HAS BEEN WREAKING HAVOC
ON OUR RESIDENTIAL ENVIRONMENT

268
00:22:26,511 --> 00:22:29,014
ONE HOUR BEFORE BOK-JA PARK DIED

269
00:22:29,097 --> 00:22:31,016
Why are you just standing there?
Go in and help her.

270
00:22:31,725 --> 00:22:32,851
Can I help her?

271
00:22:33,602 --> 00:22:35,312
It's up to you,

272
00:22:35,687 --> 00:22:38,690
but from a third party's point of view,
I think you should help her.

273
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:40,609
You're a primary party, not a third party.

274
00:22:40,692 --> 00:22:42,778
Then what does that make you, Mister?

275
00:22:43,028 --> 00:22:45,030
"Mister"? Me?

276
00:22:45,489 --> 00:22:48,950
A-jin, please don't try to
distance yourself from me.

277
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:50,786
You're like a totally different person
these days.

278
00:22:51,661 --> 00:22:54,998
Mr. Ahn, I'd like you to also pack up
your stuff and move out tomorrow.

279
00:22:55,165 --> 00:22:57,167
The third party is moving out.

280
00:22:57,709 --> 00:23:01,421
You and me, the two primaries,
should stay here together.

281
00:23:02,506 --> 00:23:04,841
Gosh, I'm speechless. How shameless.

282
00:23:05,675 --> 00:23:07,260
I never go back on what I say

283
00:23:07,344 --> 00:23:09,763
and I never change the decisions
I've made. Do you know that or not?

284
00:23:09,846 --> 00:23:11,306
Don't be like this, A-jin.

285
00:23:15,477 --> 00:23:16,561
Go in.

286
00:23:16,978 --> 00:23:18,021
Just go in!

287
00:23:18,647 --> 00:23:19,481
What the hell.

288
00:23:22,484 --> 00:23:24,986
Are you okay? Give me a second.

289
00:23:30,617 --> 00:23:32,661
Thanks to my wife,

290
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:35,205
your paintings will be included
in a show in New York.

291
00:23:35,372 --> 00:23:36,540
Don't hate me too much.

292
00:23:36,915 --> 00:23:37,958
You piece of trash.

293
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,377
What? Did you just call me "trash"?

294
00:23:40,669 --> 00:23:43,630
Look. You played me, didn't you?

295
00:23:44,381 --> 00:23:47,259
You just wanted to sleep with me.
That's all I meant to you, right?

296
00:23:47,551 --> 00:23:49,094
What kind of person do you think I am?

297
00:23:49,594 --> 00:23:51,972
I'm only letting you go
because I have a family to protect.

298
00:23:52,722 --> 00:23:54,391
My feelings for you were real.

299
00:23:55,976 --> 00:23:57,102
I loved you.

300
00:23:57,686 --> 00:23:59,396
What? Love?

301
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:01,606
I'm just speechless.

302
00:24:02,899 --> 00:24:05,819
You're the most selfish asshole
in the entire world.

303
00:24:06,736 --> 00:24:08,488
You keep saying you love
both me and your wife.

304
00:24:08,947 --> 00:24:11,032
You should have been born
during the Joseon dynasty.

305
00:24:11,241 --> 00:24:12,200
You're right.

306
00:24:12,534 --> 00:24:15,036
I've arrived at the conclusion
that I'm not cut out for this era.

307
00:24:15,912 --> 00:24:18,039
It's all my fault. I'm sorry.

308
00:24:18,415 --> 00:24:21,626
Let me give you just one good smack, okay?

309
00:24:22,335 --> 00:24:23,211
What?

310
00:24:25,505 --> 00:24:27,048
Gosh, you're bleeding.

311
00:24:31,928 --> 00:24:34,389
No, not there. Your nose.

312
00:24:36,016 --> 00:24:39,519
What? I have a nosebleed. I've...

313
00:24:39,603 --> 00:24:41,938
I've never gotten a nosebleed
from getting smacked.

314
00:24:43,273 --> 00:24:45,233
I absolutely hate violence!

315
00:24:50,155 --> 00:24:51,615
What... What was that about?

316
00:24:52,574 --> 00:24:54,451
What should I do now?

317
00:24:55,327 --> 00:24:57,245
Why on earth did I fall for that jerk?

318
00:25:03,752 --> 00:25:05,295
What did I even see in him...

319
00:25:07,005 --> 00:25:09,674
This is precisely why
my love for you has died.

320
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:13,178
I hate violent women
more than anything else in the world.

321
00:25:13,803 --> 00:25:15,680
Gosh, look at all this blood.

322
00:25:16,014 --> 00:25:18,683
I've never even donated my blood.
Do you know that?

323
00:25:25,482 --> 00:25:27,859
Then, why do you keep saying
that you think A-jin Woo killed her?

324
00:25:28,109 --> 00:25:31,112
This case is a very strange one.

325
00:25:31,696 --> 00:25:32,781
It's extremely complicated.

326
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:36,409
It's also strange that she's still deeply
involved in the family matters

327
00:25:36,493 --> 00:25:38,662
even though she and her husband
are divorced now.

328
00:25:38,787 --> 00:25:40,080
That can't be the reason.

329
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:41,998
Well, that's just
what my gut is telling me.

330
00:25:43,291 --> 00:25:46,419
Did you circulate Bong-cheol Gu's
wanted posters and contact other stations?

331
00:25:46,836 --> 00:25:47,754
Of course.

332
00:25:48,338 --> 00:25:49,547
By the way, about Bang-soon Cheon.

333
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:51,925
Why do you think she called
Ji-yeong Park first?

334
00:25:52,092 --> 00:25:54,594
Apparently, she asked for money,
but Ji-yeong Park refused her request.

335
00:25:54,761 --> 00:25:56,012
How much did she ask for?

336
00:25:56,096 --> 00:25:57,013
That I didn't ask.

337
00:25:58,181 --> 00:26:00,976
We definitely need to investigate
that woman more.

338
00:26:08,358 --> 00:26:11,278
Ms. Bang-soon Cheon.
Please come out for the questioning.

339
00:26:15,198 --> 00:26:18,535
We're detaining you because we're
concerned that you might try to flee.

340
00:26:18,743 --> 00:26:20,078
Why am I the only one detained here?

341
00:26:20,161 --> 00:26:22,497
Ms. Jo and I ran away together.
Where is she now?

342
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:24,833
She brought back everything she took.

343
00:26:25,083 --> 00:26:28,086
Anyway, she will be punished
for what she did,

344
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:30,255
but we're not detaining her
for the investigation.

345
00:26:33,049 --> 00:26:36,177
What did you and Ji-yeong Park talk about
when you spoke to her for the last time?

346
00:26:37,178 --> 00:26:39,973
I already told you. I asked her for money.

347
00:26:40,348 --> 00:26:41,474
How much did you ask for?

348
00:26:41,683 --> 00:26:42,559
One billion won.

349
00:26:43,768 --> 00:26:47,105
You pulled that number out of a hat?
It must've been based on something.

350
00:26:49,316 --> 00:26:50,317
Where are you now?

351
00:26:51,526 --> 00:26:54,446
Turn yourself in before you get caught
because it'll be better for your sake.

352
00:26:54,779 --> 00:26:55,697
Give me money.

353
00:26:56,197 --> 00:26:59,701
If you don't, I'll tell everyone
that you used to be a bar girl.

354
00:26:59,826 --> 00:27:01,911
I heard you ran away with 75 billion won.

355
00:27:02,746 --> 00:27:04,706
You can definitely spare me a billion won.

356
00:27:06,583 --> 00:27:08,376
What did you say to me
when you brought me there?

357
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,837
You said that you would treat me well.

358
00:27:11,129 --> 00:27:12,213
Hey, Bang-soon.

359
00:27:12,297 --> 00:27:13,465
THE VERY NIGHT THAT BOK-JA PARK DIED

360
00:27:13,548 --> 00:27:16,259
I deserted you because
I knew that you were this kind of person.

361
00:27:18,219 --> 00:27:20,305
You'll tell everyone that
I used to be a bar girl?

362
00:27:23,266 --> 00:27:25,602
All right. Do whatever you want.

363
00:27:27,854 --> 00:27:31,691
You need to completely erase your past
if you want to climb up the social ladder.

364
00:27:31,941 --> 00:27:34,361
Do you want that label
to follow you around all your life?

365
00:27:34,736 --> 00:27:37,489
Do you think people will believe you
if you tell them that?

366
00:27:40,283 --> 00:27:42,285
You probably have no idea
what an amazing thing money is.

367
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:47,415
All the truths and lies you tell

368
00:27:48,416 --> 00:27:51,378
I can cover it all up with money.

369
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:53,838
You wouldn't know
because you've never had it.

370
00:27:55,173 --> 00:27:56,299
Bang-soon.

371
00:27:56,966 --> 00:27:58,218
You better watch out

372
00:27:58,676 --> 00:28:00,929
because I can put you behind bars
for defamation.

373
00:28:01,221 --> 00:28:03,723
Bok-ja! I won't forgive you!

374
00:28:06,393 --> 00:28:08,561
Bring back what you stole.

375
00:28:09,187 --> 00:28:11,314
Then, I'll forgive you.

376
00:28:13,066 --> 00:28:15,527
I'm at home now.

377
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:17,987
I'm back.

378
00:28:24,786 --> 00:28:27,747
So? Did you go back?

379
00:28:28,123 --> 00:28:29,040
No.

380
00:28:30,166 --> 00:28:31,334
I didn't go back.

381
00:28:32,168 --> 00:28:33,920
-Why?
-I just...

382
00:28:35,338 --> 00:28:37,215
I couldn't trust Bok-ja anymore.

383
00:28:40,051 --> 00:28:43,763
Aren't you sad that she died?

384
00:28:48,435 --> 00:28:51,479
I would have killed her myself
if she hadn't been killed.

385
00:28:54,315 --> 00:28:55,358
Why do you say that?

386
00:28:56,651 --> 00:28:57,527
Gosh...

387
00:28:58,403 --> 00:29:00,655
I mean, she came from nothing.

388
00:29:01,322 --> 00:29:02,741
I couldn't stand her being all snobby.

389
00:29:05,869 --> 00:29:09,706
She used to serve liquor at a bar
and sleep with guys for money.

390
00:29:10,373 --> 00:29:11,750
She used to go by the name, Cho-hui.

391
00:29:13,168 --> 00:29:14,586
She's no better than me.

392
00:29:19,507 --> 00:29:22,677
Had you gone back,

393
00:29:23,219 --> 00:29:26,890
how do you think she would have
treated you?

394
00:29:35,023 --> 00:29:36,232
That fool...

395
00:29:38,026 --> 00:29:39,068
How foolish.

396
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:43,031
She shouldn't have followed me here
in the first place.

397
00:29:54,167 --> 00:29:57,212
It's me. I'm back.

398
00:29:58,338 --> 00:30:01,299
I'll compensate you for all the jewelry
that has been stolen,

399
00:30:02,425 --> 00:30:05,512
so please drop the charges
against Bang-soon.

400
00:30:15,814 --> 00:30:17,941
I'm heading out to the police station
to give my statement.

401
00:30:19,984 --> 00:30:21,277
The police called a number of times,

402
00:30:22,570 --> 00:30:24,322
asking me to appear at the station
for questioning.

403
00:30:25,031 --> 00:30:26,783
Don't avoid them.
They'll suspect you even more.

404
00:30:27,534 --> 00:30:28,868
I'll tell them everything first.

405
00:30:28,993 --> 00:30:31,913
I'm thinking about
what I should say to them.

406
00:30:33,373 --> 00:30:34,249
What do you mean?

407
00:30:34,541 --> 00:30:37,669
Should I lie to them
about going to the hotel to take the money

408
00:30:37,752 --> 00:30:40,004
from Bok-ja Park and everything else
that happened after that?

409
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:43,258
I'm just not sure
where my story should begin.

410
00:30:43,675 --> 00:30:45,510
She's dead anyway.

411
00:30:45,885 --> 00:30:48,596
Who cares? Say whatever you want.

412
00:30:49,556 --> 00:30:52,308
By the way, how's Dad doing?

413
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:56,354
Let's go home. Things are now
back to how they used to be.

414
00:30:58,356 --> 00:30:59,732
That bitch is dead now.

415
00:31:07,448 --> 00:31:09,158
So, you're saying she had returned

416
00:31:09,242 --> 00:31:11,035
when you got back
from your parents' place.

417
00:31:11,578 --> 00:31:13,788
-Yes.
-We saw that the two of you

418
00:31:14,372 --> 00:31:17,125
spoke on the phone before she died.
What did you two talk about?

419
00:31:17,333 --> 00:31:20,044
She just said that she'll compensate me
for the jewelry

420
00:31:20,128 --> 00:31:21,713
that Bang-soon Cheon stole.

421
00:31:22,505 --> 00:31:24,048
Where were you and who were you with

422
00:31:24,632 --> 00:31:26,301
when she died?

423
00:31:26,676 --> 00:31:28,094
I was with my husband.

424
00:31:30,805 --> 00:31:32,015
Didn't you report him missing?

425
00:31:32,807 --> 00:31:33,725
I did.

426
00:31:34,475 --> 00:31:36,978
I managed to get a hold of him
a few days before Bok-ja Park died.

427
00:31:37,937 --> 00:31:40,523
Then, where was he the whole time?

428
00:31:41,524 --> 00:31:42,859
His hobby is hunting.

429
00:31:43,067 --> 00:31:45,236
He said he was at a cabin
in a hunting area he frequents.

430
00:31:45,528 --> 00:31:48,615
Then, where is he now?

431
00:31:57,832 --> 00:31:59,709
At a members-only resort
called Leo Resort.

432
00:32:00,126 --> 00:32:02,503
Everyone in the family goes there
to relax from time to time.

433
00:32:04,839 --> 00:32:08,134
Then, where's Ms. Jae-hui Ahn now?

434
00:32:11,512 --> 00:32:12,472
Who is it?

435
00:32:13,264 --> 00:32:15,016
Jae-gu, it's me.

436
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:16,851
Goodness.

437
00:32:22,398 --> 00:32:23,399
Why did you come here?

438
00:32:23,858 --> 00:32:26,319
Jae-seok told me that you're staying here.

439
00:32:26,486 --> 00:32:27,737
Why do you look so freaked out?

440
00:32:28,196 --> 00:32:30,198
Jae-gu, I'm so scared right now.

441
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:32,283
I'm frightened.

442
00:32:32,367 --> 00:32:33,451
Why are you scared?

443
00:32:34,243 --> 00:32:36,037
-What should I do?
-About what?

444
00:32:37,163 --> 00:32:39,666
I saw it.

445
00:32:39,749 --> 00:32:40,833
What did you see?

446
00:32:41,876 --> 00:32:42,794
The killer.

447
00:32:43,795 --> 00:32:44,671
What?

448
00:32:46,005 --> 00:32:49,300
That day,
I fell asleep upstairs for a little while.

449
00:32:52,637 --> 00:32:54,806
I was thirsty when I woke up,
so I went downstairs.

450
00:32:55,515 --> 00:32:58,142
But, when I went downstairs...

451
00:33:13,282 --> 00:33:14,784
Bok-ja Park was dead.

452
00:33:15,952 --> 00:33:17,161
Ms. Jo was standing there.

453
00:33:18,579 --> 00:33:20,498
I ran away because I was so scared.

454
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:24,419
So, are you saying Ms. Jo is the killer?

455
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:26,421
Yes.

456
00:33:28,297 --> 00:33:32,010
What should I do, Jae-gu?
I should tell the police, right?

457
00:33:32,218 --> 00:33:33,970
-Of course, you should.
-But...

458
00:33:34,762 --> 00:33:38,307
I told the police that I wasn't home
even though I was actually there.

459
00:33:38,725 --> 00:33:40,852
What? Why did you lie to them?

460
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:43,354
I just didn't want them to suspect me.

461
00:33:44,439 --> 00:33:47,316
Gyeong-ja Jo,
the first person who found the victim,

462
00:33:47,859 --> 00:33:49,444
called us at 9:17 a.m.

463
00:33:50,111 --> 00:33:52,655
Jae-hui Ahn, who was upstairs,
came downstairs right at that moment

464
00:33:52,989 --> 00:33:55,241
-and saw Gyeong-ja Jo?
-That's correct.

465
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:59,370
She saw Jae-hui Ahn running away
and assumed that she'd be the killer.

466
00:34:00,163 --> 00:34:03,249
They pegged each other as the killer
in their statements.

467
00:34:03,666 --> 00:34:05,585
Gyeong-ja Jo was at a hospital
in Gyeonggi Province

468
00:34:05,668 --> 00:34:08,212
at the time of the victim's death
as her daughter is hospitalized there.

469
00:34:08,296 --> 00:34:09,589
We confirmed her alibi.

470
00:34:09,797 --> 00:34:11,591
-What about Jae-hui Ahn?
-She was at home.

471
00:34:12,383 --> 00:34:14,510
She was the only one there
at the time of the victim's death.

472
00:34:14,886 --> 00:34:17,263
-And?
-She lied to us. She said she wasn't home.

473
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:20,224
She did say that she saw Gyeong-ja Jo
when she came downstairs,

474
00:34:20,433 --> 00:34:22,727
but she keeps saying she wasn't home,
which makes no sense at all.

475
00:34:23,728 --> 00:34:25,229
All of Mr. Ahn's children are weird.

476
00:34:25,688 --> 00:34:29,150
I'm thinking that's probably why he gave
all of his assets to his new wife.

477
00:34:30,443 --> 00:34:31,903
Have you questioned Jae-gu Ahn yet?

478
00:34:31,986 --> 00:34:33,488
He said he'll come to the station soon.

479
00:34:34,614 --> 00:34:37,325
Let's catch the killer soon.
Who do you guys think it is?

480
00:34:37,658 --> 00:34:38,576
By the way,

481
00:34:40,369 --> 00:34:41,621
we found a will at the scene.

482
00:34:44,373 --> 00:34:47,376
We compared it with Ji-yeong Park's
handwriting and she did not write that.

483
00:34:48,252 --> 00:34:50,421
We looked through her belongings

484
00:34:51,047 --> 00:34:53,299
and found this in her wallet.

485
00:34:57,470 --> 00:35:00,306
The handwriting on that note
matches the one

486
00:35:00,932 --> 00:35:01,974
on the will.

487
00:35:03,017 --> 00:35:05,061
What is this? And what is this note?

488
00:35:07,605 --> 00:35:10,066
-Ji-hu, you'll be a fourth grader soon.
-Yes.

489
00:35:10,942 --> 00:35:13,569
I heard that your school is closer
to the house you're moving to.

490
00:35:13,903 --> 00:35:16,072
Yes, Grandpa.
I'll be able to walk to school.

491
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:18,449
That's great.

492
00:35:19,909 --> 00:35:21,661
-Grandpa.
-Yes?

493
00:35:21,911 --> 00:35:23,788
You've changed a lot.

494
00:35:24,664 --> 00:35:26,082
I've changed? Really?

495
00:35:26,415 --> 00:35:28,376
-Yes.
-How?

496
00:35:28,751 --> 00:35:30,586
You look younger than you did before,

497
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:32,839
and you sound friendlier.

498
00:35:32,922 --> 00:35:35,883
You look happier too.
You also don't yell anymore.

499
00:35:37,176 --> 00:35:38,719
-You think so?
-Yes.

500
00:35:41,013 --> 00:35:43,182
I'm happy to know that you think
I've changed for the better.

501
00:35:43,516 --> 00:35:45,768
All of those changes happened

502
00:35:46,018 --> 00:35:47,478
after you met Grandma.

503
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:52,358
Ji-hu, we should go.

504
00:35:52,942 --> 00:35:54,819
Father, we'll get going.

505
00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:56,612
Take good care of yourself.

506
00:35:56,988 --> 00:35:58,823
-A-jin.
-Yes.

507
00:35:59,323 --> 00:36:01,701
Hold a good funeral for her.

508
00:36:02,785 --> 00:36:03,870
You should attend it.

509
00:36:04,245 --> 00:36:05,413
No, I won't.

510
00:36:07,790 --> 00:36:11,085
Ji-hu, can you go to Un-gyu's room
for a minute?

511
00:36:11,419 --> 00:36:12,253
Sure.

512
00:36:20,052 --> 00:36:24,307
Someone in our family killed her.

513
00:36:27,810 --> 00:36:29,562
I feel so guilty.

514
00:36:30,771 --> 00:36:32,356
You have no reason to feel guilty, Father.

515
00:36:33,399 --> 00:36:35,151
I killed her.

516
00:36:38,613 --> 00:36:40,323
She got killed like that because of me.

517
00:36:41,616 --> 00:36:44,911
I feel too guilty to even attend
her funeral.

518
00:36:47,246 --> 00:36:48,998
Thanks for taking care of it
all by yourself.

519
00:36:51,375 --> 00:36:53,211
No problem, please don't worry.

520
00:36:54,754 --> 00:36:57,798
And I wish you all the best. Thanks
for everything you've done for the family.

521
00:37:00,927 --> 00:37:04,180
Jae-seok and I are no longer married,

522
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:06,140
but I'll visit you often.

523
00:37:08,517 --> 00:37:10,561
I was happy

524
00:37:12,396 --> 00:37:13,814
while I lived with her.

525
00:37:15,983 --> 00:37:17,944
Yes, you were.

526
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:19,904
I know that.

527
00:37:23,324 --> 00:37:24,659
Life is...

528
00:37:25,368 --> 00:37:27,078
Looking back now at this old age,

529
00:37:28,871 --> 00:37:32,333
I know that what matters is
eating the things you want to eat,

530
00:37:32,875 --> 00:37:34,377
going to the places that you want to go,

531
00:37:35,628 --> 00:37:38,506
and meeting the people you want to meet.
That's all there is to it.

532
00:37:40,633 --> 00:37:42,260
You get angry
when you can't do those things,

533
00:37:43,010 --> 00:37:44,804
and you're happy
when you get to enjoy those things.

534
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:48,224
Life is just growing old like that.

535
00:37:50,101 --> 00:37:53,187
While living with her, I was truly...

536
00:37:56,232 --> 00:37:57,108
happy.

537
00:38:04,824 --> 00:38:07,910
By the way, did Grandma go somewhere?

538
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:09,787
Well. Yes, she's away now.

539
00:38:10,037 --> 00:38:11,163
Where did she go?

540
00:38:11,956 --> 00:38:14,000
-Abroad.
-Which country?

541
00:38:14,583 --> 00:38:17,044
My princess, you're bombarding me
with questions again.

542
00:38:17,169 --> 00:38:18,212
Tell me. Which country?

543
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:22,842
-France.
-France? Why?

544
00:38:26,012 --> 00:38:27,096
To study art.

545
00:38:27,638 --> 00:38:28,764
She's studying art?

546
00:38:28,973 --> 00:38:31,225
Yes. She wants to become a painter.

547
00:38:32,018 --> 00:38:34,562
Oh, I see. I knew it.

548
00:38:34,979 --> 00:38:36,981
I could tell.

549
00:38:37,857 --> 00:38:39,984
What? What do you mean?

550
00:38:40,401 --> 00:38:41,986
Have you looked into her eyes?

551
00:38:43,362 --> 00:38:46,157
-Her eyes?
-The eyes can't lie.

552
00:38:47,199 --> 00:38:49,452
Her eyes are... How should I put this?

553
00:38:50,036 --> 00:38:51,704
They were always full of dreams.

554
00:38:53,122 --> 00:38:54,040
Dreams?

555
00:38:56,125 --> 00:38:58,502
-Let's go.
-Dreams and desires.

556
00:38:59,378 --> 00:39:01,964
What would be the difference
between the two?

557
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:05,426
Should I have just kept on dreaming

558
00:39:06,594 --> 00:39:07,511
like that little girl said

559
00:39:08,554 --> 00:39:10,681
and have done no more?

560
00:39:17,146 --> 00:39:18,439
If I can be born again,

561
00:39:19,982 --> 00:39:21,275
I'll become a painter.

562
00:39:36,916 --> 00:39:38,709
I heard you've moved out of A-jin's place.

563
00:39:39,543 --> 00:39:40,419
Yes.

564
00:39:41,962 --> 00:39:43,798
Artists are allowed to be
a little promiscuous.

565
00:39:44,465 --> 00:39:47,802
I just had a problem with you having
an affair with my good friend's husband.

566
00:39:48,969 --> 00:39:51,847
Whenever you meet a guy,
you should do some digging

567
00:39:51,931 --> 00:39:54,225
and vet him before you start dating him.

568
00:39:55,184 --> 00:39:56,519
Korea is a small country.

569
00:39:57,144 --> 00:39:59,063
I guess the reunification
will expand the borders,

570
00:39:59,647 --> 00:40:02,233
but without that, everyone is connected
by just two degrees of separation.

571
00:40:05,444 --> 00:40:07,113
You should start preparing
for the show now.

572
00:40:07,863 --> 00:40:09,532
Yes, which canvas size should I go for?

573
00:40:09,865 --> 00:40:11,867
You need to get A-jin's advice
even on things like that.

574
00:40:14,453 --> 00:40:16,122
You know that Bok-ja Park died, right?

575
00:40:16,956 --> 00:40:20,876
Yes, I gave a statement to the police
as Jae-seok and A-jin's alibi witness.

576
00:40:21,085 --> 00:40:23,129
Why don't you explore that theme
in your painting? Death.

577
00:40:25,756 --> 00:40:29,927
After this year, the exhibition will
probably be turned into a biennale,

578
00:40:30,428 --> 00:40:33,472
but all the works in the past years
have been too colorful. Hope and vision?

579
00:40:33,889 --> 00:40:35,766
We've only shown works
that explored such themes.

580
00:40:36,642 --> 00:40:38,644
No more utopian themes.
How about dystopia?

581
00:40:39,645 --> 00:40:41,021
That should be your direction.

582
00:40:41,772 --> 00:40:44,358
Will such a dark subject suit my style?

583
00:40:45,401 --> 00:40:47,194
Your painting, War II,

584
00:40:47,528 --> 00:40:49,530
is the most impactful work
you've produced so far.

585
00:40:50,739 --> 00:40:53,701
Doesn't Bok-ja Park's death inspire you?

586
00:40:55,453 --> 00:40:57,163
Don't you pity that poor woman?

587
00:40:58,205 --> 00:40:59,748
I feel so bad for her.

588
00:41:00,749 --> 00:41:03,002
She died after tasting a fleeting bliss.

589
00:41:04,044 --> 00:41:05,963
The party was way too short.

590
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:07,423
When someone dies,

591
00:41:08,090 --> 00:41:11,969
the death becomes a mere gossiping topic
for someone else.

592
00:41:13,012 --> 00:41:16,515
But my death will become a painting.

593
00:41:17,224 --> 00:41:19,518
Life is truly ironic,

594
00:41:19,977 --> 00:41:22,188
yet there's something
that runs through the whole course of it.

595
00:41:26,066 --> 00:41:27,735
Five pairs of the pumps.

596
00:41:28,527 --> 00:41:30,488
For the boots... What?

597
00:41:32,531 --> 00:41:33,616
Where did my will go?

598
00:41:34,116 --> 00:41:36,410
-Your will?
-Yes, it's just something I wrote.

599
00:41:37,077 --> 00:41:38,120
A-jin.

600
00:41:38,954 --> 00:41:40,039
I picked this up.

601
00:41:48,797 --> 00:41:50,674
It's beautiful, isn't it?

602
00:41:51,592 --> 00:41:53,677
Yes, it turned out so well.

603
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:58,224
What am I supposed to do now
with this gorgeous suit?

604
00:42:00,226 --> 00:42:03,270
We can't even do a fitting.
She never got to try it on.

605
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:07,441
This will look great on her.

606
00:42:10,653 --> 00:42:14,073
Daesung Pulp was taken over
by Gangil Group today.

607
00:42:14,406 --> 00:42:17,660
Last year, there was a lot of news
about Ji-yeong Park, the wife

608
00:42:17,743 --> 00:42:20,829
of Daesung Pulp's founder, Tae-dong Ahn,
selling the company shares

609
00:42:20,913 --> 00:42:23,916
as soon as they were transferred to her
by Mr. Ahn.

610
00:42:24,792 --> 00:42:28,003
However, her death which occurred
on the 28th of last month

611
00:42:28,128 --> 00:42:30,464
has given rise to various speculations
and suspicions.

612
00:42:31,048 --> 00:42:34,510
The police, who are investigating
Ji-yeong Park's death,

613
00:42:34,593 --> 00:42:37,137
stated that they have found
a crucial piece of evidence at the scene

614
00:42:37,221 --> 00:42:40,307
and that they're focusing
on tracking down the suspect.

615
00:42:44,478 --> 00:42:49,233
It looks like she died
after being hit twice by the killer.

616
00:42:51,527 --> 00:42:53,737
The killer didn't leave footprints
anywhere in the house.

617
00:42:53,904 --> 00:42:56,448
We didn't find the killer's fingerprints
or saliva on the scene either.

618
00:42:56,991 --> 00:42:58,951
All we found
was her family's fingerprints.

619
00:42:59,159 --> 00:43:00,703
Could it be
one of the family members' doing?

620
00:43:00,828 --> 00:43:02,705
It was someone who knows
the passcode for the door,

621
00:43:03,747 --> 00:43:05,833
somebody who knew
that the victim was home at the time.

622
00:43:06,417 --> 00:43:08,544
Most importantly,

623
00:43:09,253 --> 00:43:10,963
those with the clearest motive
for murdering her

624
00:43:11,755 --> 00:43:12,798
are her family members.

625
00:43:14,341 --> 00:43:15,259
And...

626
00:43:15,884 --> 00:43:18,887
This is the crucial piece
of evidence we've found.

627
00:43:19,305 --> 00:43:21,557
We've identified the prime suspect.

628
00:43:25,644 --> 00:43:27,605
Did everything go well
at the police station?

629
00:43:28,772 --> 00:43:31,275
Of course. I gave them my statement.

630
00:43:31,483 --> 00:43:34,403
Gosh. Visiting a police station
is never a pleasant experience.

631
00:43:35,529 --> 00:43:37,114
The dividends will be
distributed tomorrow.

632
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:39,325
The deal was closed at 120 billion won,

633
00:43:40,034 --> 00:43:41,493
so each person will get four billion won.

634
00:43:46,582 --> 00:43:48,709
Do the two of you
have a secret deal or something?

635
00:43:48,917 --> 00:43:50,461
Why are you two
exchanging looks like that?

636
00:43:51,045 --> 00:43:51,920
Gosh.

637
00:43:52,004 --> 00:43:54,673
-Are you seeing each other?
-You and your nonsense again.

638
00:43:58,135 --> 00:44:01,347
I need to use the washroom,
so go ahead with your secret talk.

639
00:44:07,227 --> 00:44:09,897
What happened?
The branch manager is losing it.

640
00:44:10,522 --> 00:44:12,775
Ji-yeong Park must be close to reporters.

641
00:44:13,108 --> 00:44:15,903
She even distributed a press release
that says she was conned by MK Capital.

642
00:44:15,986 --> 00:44:16,820
I'm aware.

643
00:44:17,571 --> 00:44:19,531
You'll be in deep trouble
they find out about this.

644
00:44:19,782 --> 00:44:21,283
They'll kill us.

645
00:44:22,242 --> 00:44:25,371
Do I really have to live in this anxiety
for that ten billion won?

646
00:44:25,454 --> 00:44:29,333
Hey, I'm taking 60 percent.
I mean, I did all the work.

647
00:44:29,625 --> 00:44:31,001
You jerk. You're at it again?

648
00:44:31,335 --> 00:44:33,712
Jeez, I had to get blood on my hands!

649
00:44:36,173 --> 00:44:37,132
Don't tell me...

650
00:44:37,966 --> 00:44:39,176
Did you kill her?

651
00:44:40,052 --> 00:44:41,053
Was it your doing?

652
00:44:42,054 --> 00:44:43,055
It wasn't you, right?

653
00:44:43,555 --> 00:44:46,725
Those who were intoxicated by money
were not at all ashamed

654
00:44:47,101 --> 00:44:49,561
of being untruthful or deceiving others.

655
00:44:50,354 --> 00:44:51,688
Also, they thought that human life

656
00:44:52,147 --> 00:44:55,442
could never be more valuable than money.

657
00:44:55,943 --> 00:44:58,487
CONFIRMATION OF TRANSFER OF THE DECEASED

658
00:45:03,492 --> 00:45:06,203
The body has been sent
to Gwangun Hospital.

659
00:45:07,121 --> 00:45:09,123
-Okay.
-I hope the funeral goes well.

660
00:45:09,289 --> 00:45:11,417
Please come back after the funeral
for further questioning.

661
00:45:12,167 --> 00:45:13,127
Sure.

662
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:26,390
Please put this suit on her.

663
00:45:30,227 --> 00:45:32,688
We worried about possible misfortunes
when we were happy,

664
00:45:33,397 --> 00:45:36,525
and we hoped for happiness
when such misfortunes befell us.

665
00:45:37,192 --> 00:45:39,862
Most importantly,
we lived with ceaseless desires

666
00:45:40,362 --> 00:45:42,656
for things that we couldn't have.

667
00:45:43,866 --> 00:45:46,577
The days that we were sad outnumbered
the days that we were happy,

668
00:45:47,578 --> 00:45:51,331
and pain always outpowered sadness

669
00:45:51,707 --> 00:45:52,875
in this thing called life.

670
00:45:53,917 --> 00:45:57,421
I was grateful for life itself.

671
00:45:57,963 --> 00:46:00,674
"I thank and love

672
00:46:01,717 --> 00:46:04,052
the life I've lived
and the people I've met

673
00:46:04,136 --> 00:46:05,679
over the course of my life."

674
00:46:08,474 --> 00:46:10,392
Whose will is this?

675
00:46:18,484 --> 00:46:21,904
You went to Ji-yeong Park's suite
at Saint Palace Hotel

676
00:46:22,321 --> 00:46:23,572
on January 23rd,

677
00:46:23,989 --> 00:46:27,367
and you were caught
by her bodyguard there.

678
00:46:28,118 --> 00:46:29,995
Please tell me what happened after that.

679
00:46:30,913 --> 00:46:33,457
Ms. Park said that his continuous threats
were making her anxious,

680
00:46:34,166 --> 00:46:35,209
so I took him away from her.

681
00:46:35,667 --> 00:46:37,169
Why didn't you report him to the police?

682
00:46:37,419 --> 00:46:38,879
My client didn't want that.

683
00:46:39,796 --> 00:46:41,590
I just did what I was told to do.

684
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:44,426
-So, it was Ji-yeong Park's order?
-Correct.

685
00:46:45,093 --> 00:46:47,596
So? What happened after that?

686
00:46:48,805 --> 00:46:50,724
I had a talk with him
and told him not to do it again.

687
00:46:51,683 --> 00:46:53,685
-Then I let him go.
-What?

688
00:46:53,977 --> 00:46:56,605
That was also my client's order.

689
00:47:00,067 --> 00:47:01,360
That doesn't make any sense.

690
00:47:01,568 --> 00:47:04,071
We received a missing-person report
for Jae-gu Ahn.

691
00:47:04,154 --> 00:47:05,322
He was nowhere to be found.

692
00:47:06,281 --> 00:47:08,700
He's probably at a hunting preserve.

693
00:47:08,992 --> 00:47:11,411
That's where he told me
that he was headed.

694
00:47:11,954 --> 00:47:13,163
I don't get it.

695
00:47:14,414 --> 00:47:17,668
If you let him go like that,
he'd go back to Ji-yeong Park

696
00:47:17,751 --> 00:47:19,002
and try to threaten her again.

697
00:47:20,963 --> 00:47:23,590
She told you to just let him go?

698
00:47:24,174 --> 00:47:25,008
Yes.

699
00:47:38,272 --> 00:47:41,775
Mr. Han, I brought him to a motel nearby.

700
00:47:42,234 --> 00:47:44,152
Okay, get out of there.
It's a family fight after all.

701
00:47:44,778 --> 00:47:46,321
We shouldn't be meddling in it.

702
00:47:47,239 --> 00:47:48,824
We just have to do what we need to do.

703
00:47:48,991 --> 00:47:49,992
Okay, got it.

704
00:47:55,455 --> 00:47:57,332
Were you really at the hunting preserve?

705
00:47:58,083 --> 00:47:59,001
Yes.

706
00:48:00,586 --> 00:48:02,045
Why didn't you go back?

707
00:48:02,796 --> 00:48:06,216
You neither went home nor went back
to Ji-yeong Park's hotel room.

708
00:48:08,010 --> 00:48:10,554
That's because I didn't want

709
00:48:11,138 --> 00:48:13,265
to harass her anymore.

710
00:48:14,850 --> 00:48:16,351
That's just how I felt. All of a sudden,

711
00:48:17,728 --> 00:48:19,521
I felt that everything was pointless.

712
00:48:19,896 --> 00:48:21,898
You said that you were with your wife

713
00:48:22,983 --> 00:48:25,444
at Leo Resort
around 2 a.m. on February 28th.

714
00:48:26,236 --> 00:48:29,656
-That's correct.
-We went through all the CCTV footage,

715
00:48:30,699 --> 00:48:34,202
but it unfortunately didn't show you

716
00:48:35,871 --> 00:48:38,540
-entering the room that day.
-I checked into the resort on the 24th

717
00:48:39,249 --> 00:48:41,418
and didn't step out of the room at all.

718
00:48:41,543 --> 00:48:42,753
Where were you that day?

719
00:48:42,836 --> 00:48:44,212
Like I told you, I was at Leo Resort.

720
00:48:49,509 --> 00:48:52,721
This. It's yours, isn't it?

721
00:48:55,932 --> 00:48:58,018
That's the knife you used
when you attempted

722
00:48:58,977 --> 00:49:00,228
to kill her in the past, right?

723
00:49:01,647 --> 00:49:05,692
You dropped that knife at the scene.

724
00:49:08,779 --> 00:49:09,863
You didn't know, did you?

725
00:49:10,697 --> 00:49:11,740
What?

726
00:49:15,285 --> 00:49:16,536
You found this at the scene?

727
00:49:19,748 --> 00:49:24,086
You deeply resented the victim,
Ji-yeong Park.

728
00:49:24,961 --> 00:49:26,713
You had planned her murder several times,

729
00:49:27,506 --> 00:49:29,299
but none of your attempts succeeded.

730
00:49:30,092 --> 00:49:33,553
That was after you found out
that she came back,

731
00:49:34,221 --> 00:49:37,933
and you assumed that she had planned
to kill your father

732
00:49:38,308 --> 00:49:40,936
by giving him food with poison,

733
00:49:41,019 --> 00:49:43,897
so your anger and hatred toward her
must've been more intense than ever.

734
00:49:54,282 --> 00:49:58,161
You must've left the house
after killing her like that,

735
00:50:00,539 --> 00:50:03,417
but then you saw your footprints
with the wet soil from the rain.

736
00:50:04,167 --> 00:50:06,920
Hence, you probably thought
that you had to clean them up.

737
00:50:08,046 --> 00:50:09,005
Then...

738
00:50:15,637 --> 00:50:19,433
You dropped this jackknife by the door.

739
00:50:25,564 --> 00:50:26,481
Why are you here?

740
00:50:27,733 --> 00:50:30,694
Jae-gu, was it your doing?

741
00:50:31,862 --> 00:50:35,574
No, it wasn't me.
I wasn't in Seoul on February 28th.

742
00:50:35,866 --> 00:50:36,992
I was at Leo Resort.

743
00:50:37,617 --> 00:50:40,996
Sir, please make sure you pay me
for all of my hours up to February 28th.

744
00:50:47,335 --> 00:50:50,756
Do you think that I killed her?

745
00:51:04,936 --> 00:51:05,979
It's all done.

746
00:51:06,229 --> 00:51:07,147
Thanks for everything.

747
00:51:09,191 --> 00:51:11,610
Go to a sauna and get some rest
for the next few days.

748
00:51:19,534 --> 00:51:22,162
Whom do you think
the police are suspecting at the moment?

749
00:51:23,663 --> 00:51:25,624
Why do you think I let Jae-gu Ahn go?

750
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:30,170
I let him go right away
so that he can take care of Bok-ja Park.

751
00:51:30,879 --> 00:51:34,090
That punk. He didn't kill her
and kept himself busy with something else.

752
00:51:34,883 --> 00:51:36,009
What did he do?

753
00:52:14,673 --> 00:52:17,968
VISITOR'S PARKING

754
00:52:24,975 --> 00:52:26,518
Was everything okay at the funeral?

755
00:52:28,270 --> 00:52:29,145
Yes.

756
00:52:29,688 --> 00:52:32,732
What did you do
with Ms. Park's belongings?

757
00:52:35,569 --> 00:52:39,197
They were things that she wanted so badly.

758
00:52:41,199 --> 00:52:43,034
I wanted her to take all of them.

759
00:52:44,369 --> 00:52:45,912
The smell of burning leather was

760
00:52:46,705 --> 00:52:48,373
really revolting.

761
00:52:49,124 --> 00:52:51,918
What a waste.
You burned all that expensive stuff.

762
00:52:52,627 --> 00:52:53,503
Then,

763
00:52:55,630 --> 00:52:59,467
I burned my last gift for her.

764
00:53:00,635 --> 00:53:01,595
What was it?

765
00:53:08,226 --> 00:53:09,477
Do you like art?

766
00:53:09,728 --> 00:53:11,813
I just enjoy looking at paintings.

767
00:53:12,355 --> 00:53:13,857
Life is tough, you know.

768
00:53:14,941 --> 00:53:18,111
Looking at paintings
gives me peace of mind.

769
00:53:18,612 --> 00:53:22,407
If I can be born again,
I'll become a painter.

770
00:53:33,835 --> 00:53:36,796
We found this amongst her belongings.

771
00:53:39,090 --> 00:53:41,009
I wrote this.

772
00:53:42,177 --> 00:53:43,970
-Sorry?
-Well...

773
00:53:44,512 --> 00:53:46,473
I'm taking a meditation class,

774
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:50,393
and we had to write our will
as our homework.

775
00:53:51,561 --> 00:53:52,479
I see.

776
00:53:53,855 --> 00:53:56,441
Then, how come Ms. Park had it?

777
00:53:58,902 --> 00:54:00,987
I must've left it at that house.

778
00:54:04,574 --> 00:54:05,450
Then,

779
00:54:06,201 --> 00:54:08,244
did you write this too?

780
00:54:08,662 --> 00:54:11,039
Thank you so much
for washing my clothes perfectly.

781
00:54:11,122 --> 00:54:13,500
May happiness surround you always,
wherever you go.

782
00:54:18,129 --> 00:54:19,506
It looks pretty old.

783
00:54:21,967 --> 00:54:22,801
Yes.

784
00:54:24,344 --> 00:54:25,595
I think I wrote this.

785
00:54:26,805 --> 00:54:29,140
So, Bok-ja Park.

786
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:32,394
I mean, Ms. Ji-yeong Park.
You said you met her for the first time

787
00:54:32,686 --> 00:54:34,521
when you interviewed her
for the caregiver position,

788
00:54:34,688 --> 00:54:38,441
but we did some digging and found out
that the two of you go way back.

789
00:54:39,943 --> 00:54:42,821
You met her for the first time

790
00:54:43,363 --> 00:54:44,322
at the hotel

791
00:54:44,990 --> 00:54:47,659
where she stayed long-term
after she disappeared

792
00:54:48,660 --> 00:54:49,869
with the money

793
00:54:50,870 --> 00:54:52,330
from selling the company.

794
00:54:54,416 --> 00:54:55,709
You really don't remember?

795
00:54:56,126 --> 00:54:58,878
The suite at Saint Palace Hotel.

796
00:55:02,716 --> 00:55:04,718
I do remember now.

797
00:55:24,988 --> 00:55:27,365
May happiness surround you always,
wherever you go.

798
00:55:42,839 --> 00:55:43,798
But...

799
00:55:46,009 --> 00:55:47,594
I'll be good to him from now on.

800
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:50,430
You trust me, right?

801
00:55:51,681 --> 00:55:52,599
Yes, I trust you.

802
00:55:54,142 --> 00:55:55,310
I'm always

803
00:55:58,104 --> 00:56:01,316
grateful for everything you do.

804
00:56:15,121 --> 00:56:16,164
You left this.

805
00:56:18,708 --> 00:56:20,960
It was here. I've been looking for it.

806
00:58:01,853 --> 00:58:02,854
Hello.

807
00:58:03,104 --> 00:58:05,148
Well, I think I left my wallet here

808
00:58:05,231 --> 00:58:07,400
late at night on February 28th.

809
00:58:07,984 --> 00:58:10,195
May I check your security camera footage?

810
00:58:10,361 --> 00:58:13,323
Not now. I need my boss' permission
on things like this.

811
00:58:14,324 --> 00:58:15,825
Could you come back tomorrow morning?

812
00:58:40,266 --> 00:58:42,060
Hello? Mr. Kim?

813
00:58:44,354 --> 00:58:45,897
I'm at the hospital now.

814
00:58:46,814 --> 00:58:48,024
Just go home.

815
01:00:05,310 --> 01:00:08,688
Maybe we were meant to meet.
I'm a big fan of Matisse's works too.

816
01:00:08,771 --> 01:00:10,940
I do like his paintings,

817
01:00:11,482 --> 01:00:13,776
but I actually like Manet more.

818
01:00:13,860 --> 01:00:14,819
I'm sorry.

819
01:00:15,194 --> 01:00:18,239
I shouldn't have hired her.

820
01:00:19,157 --> 01:00:20,199
I'm sorry.

821
01:00:20,533 --> 01:00:23,369
I was the one who introduced that painter

822
01:00:24,287 --> 01:00:25,622
to you,

823
01:00:25,872 --> 01:00:29,417
and Father met that woman because of me.

824
01:00:29,959 --> 01:00:33,796
That's not your fault.
Those who made the choices are at fault.

825
01:00:33,880 --> 01:00:37,175
There are things that
you just can't pull yourself away from.

826
01:00:37,342 --> 01:00:40,845
I liked her a lot.

827
01:00:41,137 --> 01:00:42,597
I'm going into the police station now.

828
01:00:42,680 --> 01:00:44,307
Dump everything on Bok-ja Park.

829
01:00:44,515 --> 01:00:45,892
She's already dead.

830
01:00:46,392 --> 01:00:48,603
Mr. Gu. Hey, Bong-cheol Gu!

831
01:00:48,686 --> 01:00:50,104
Do you have an alibi?

832
01:00:50,188 --> 01:00:52,732
I guess my husband and I will have to be
each other's witness.

833
01:00:52,815 --> 01:00:54,817
The eldest son's wife
ordered me to kill her.

834
01:00:54,942 --> 01:00:56,277
Why did he do such a thing?

835
01:00:56,861 --> 01:01:00,490
We'll get his sentence mitigated.
Let's do our best to help him out.

836
01:01:01,157 --> 01:01:02,533
After all, tomorrow is

837
01:01:03,868 --> 01:01:05,620
another day.

838
01:01:06,871 --> 01:01:08,790
