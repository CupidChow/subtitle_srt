1
00:00:40,665 --> 00:00:43,251
As you can see, somebody made
the canopy collapse.

2
00:00:43,334 --> 00:00:47,213
It was the man
from the video sent by A-jin.

3
00:00:47,297 --> 00:00:48,965
What does that have to do
with my marriage?

4
00:00:49,048 --> 00:00:50,133
Why does it not?

5
00:00:50,383 --> 00:00:51,926
She is one of the suspects.

6
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:55,221
If you get caught, tell them

7
00:00:55,346 --> 00:00:56,973
that Ms. Park told you to do it.

8
00:00:57,057 --> 00:00:58,016
She told me

9
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:01,770
to take this secret to the grave.

10
00:01:01,936 --> 00:01:03,980
You know that Ji-hu won a prize
in the drawing competition.

11
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:05,148
Thank you so much.

12
00:01:05,231 --> 00:01:07,108
I have only one woman in my world
and that's you.

13
00:01:07,609 --> 00:01:09,027
Are there two suns in this world?

14
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:11,946
There's only one sun in this world.

15
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:14,574
But there are no records on her whatsoever

16
00:01:15,366 --> 00:01:16,451
from 2009 to 2015.

17
00:01:16,534 --> 00:01:18,745
You're the only one

18
00:01:19,454 --> 00:01:20,455
that I can trust.

19
00:01:20,538 --> 00:01:21,790
I hope we can

20
00:01:22,207 --> 00:01:25,001
see each other more often.

21
00:01:25,251 --> 00:01:27,712
He has also been exercising
early in the morning every day.

22
00:01:27,796 --> 00:01:29,756
He hasn't been cycling every morning.

23
00:01:29,881 --> 00:01:32,550
Your husband is suspicious.

24
00:01:32,634 --> 00:01:33,676
I'll look into it.

25
00:01:34,302 --> 00:01:36,471
I don't want to hear it from someone else.

26
00:03:26,956 --> 00:03:27,874
Hi, Mom.

27
00:03:30,335 --> 00:03:31,377
I just got home.

28
00:03:32,795 --> 00:03:36,007
I stopped by because I was craving
those wraps you make. Nothing is wrong.

29
00:03:39,302 --> 00:03:40,386
Everything is fine.

30
00:03:40,929 --> 00:03:41,763
Yes.

31
00:03:42,263 --> 00:03:43,097
All right.

32
00:03:44,974 --> 00:03:47,227
Have a good time with your friends.

33
00:03:48,102 --> 00:03:48,937
All right.

34
00:03:49,145 --> 00:03:50,230
Talk to you soon.

35
00:03:51,356 --> 00:03:52,190
Okay.

36
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:02,116
Where did you go so early in the morning?
Mr. Ahn went to work.

37
00:04:02,533 --> 00:04:04,327
Ji-hu had breakfast
and went to school too.

38
00:04:04,953 --> 00:04:05,828
Thank you.

39
00:04:06,454 --> 00:04:08,373
Did something happen?

40
00:04:09,332 --> 00:04:10,208
No.

41
00:04:18,424 --> 00:04:20,218
Jin-hee, where are you now?

42
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:23,012
Stay there.

43
00:04:23,429 --> 00:04:24,347
I'll meet you there.

44
00:04:28,059 --> 00:04:29,727
Have you looked into what's going on?

45
00:04:31,354 --> 00:04:32,689
Tell me.

46
00:04:34,315 --> 00:04:37,151
I want to know what you saw
and what you know.

47
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:38,569
Tell me everything.

48
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:41,030
Well...

49
00:04:42,198 --> 00:04:43,574
How did you know that Ji-hu's dad...

50
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:46,327
I mean,

51
00:04:49,163 --> 00:04:50,331
my husband.

52
00:04:53,251 --> 00:04:54,335
How did you know

53
00:04:56,337 --> 00:04:58,131
that he has been seeing another woman?

54
00:04:59,090 --> 00:04:59,924
That's...

55
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:05,638
I saw him with Ji-hu's art teacher.

56
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:08,182
Tell me exactly what you saw.

57
00:05:12,395 --> 00:05:13,688
To tell you the truth,

58
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:17,650
there have been many times when he offered
to pick Ji-hu up from her art lesson.

59
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:20,528
But I didn't suspect anything back then.

60
00:05:20,695 --> 00:05:23,448
That day, I guess he had called me

61
00:05:23,781 --> 00:05:25,867
to tell me that he'd be picking Ji-hu up,

62
00:05:26,367 --> 00:05:28,369
but I happened to miss his call.

63
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:30,997
When I got there to pick her up,

64
00:05:31,205 --> 00:05:32,749
I saw her teacher and your husband...

65
00:05:34,792 --> 00:05:36,002
They were...

66
00:05:36,794 --> 00:05:37,628
Well...

67
00:05:38,796 --> 00:05:40,214
What I'm trying to say is

68
00:05:41,799 --> 00:05:44,177
they were touching each other

69
00:05:44,343 --> 00:05:46,804
in a way that only couples would.

70
00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:53,186
A-jin, I could have gotten the wrong idea.
You should check to make sure.

71
00:05:53,352 --> 00:05:55,480
You know that Jae-seok
befriends people easily.

72
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:57,190
And he's not guarded.

73
00:05:57,273 --> 00:05:59,442
How exactly were they touching each other?

74
00:06:00,443 --> 00:06:01,360
What I'm saying is...

75
00:06:02,111 --> 00:06:05,281
He was caressing her face with his hand...

76
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:11,037
A-jin.

77
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,915
You don't even need to check.

78
00:06:15,124 --> 00:06:17,335
He's having an affair with that woman.

79
00:06:27,345 --> 00:06:29,347
If Father marries that woman,

80
00:06:30,014 --> 00:06:31,432
I'll move out of this house.

81
00:06:32,016 --> 00:06:34,644
So what?
Do you think anyone will even care?

82
00:06:35,937 --> 00:06:38,856
You're not saying you'll leave Un-gyu here
and move out alone, are you?

83
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:40,650
-Jae-hui.
-Un-gyu

84
00:06:40,942 --> 00:06:43,444
is Dad's eldest grandchild.
Dad will probably let you move out,

85
00:06:43,778 --> 00:06:45,613
but he won't let you take him.

86
00:06:47,156 --> 00:06:49,158
That's why I've been putting up
with everything.

87
00:06:49,992 --> 00:06:53,663
We need to fight together.
If we don't, Bok-ja Park will win.

88
00:06:53,746 --> 00:06:55,456
We definitely shouldn't underestimate her.

89
00:06:55,706 --> 00:06:58,334
Fighting amongst ourselves can wait
until after we beat her.

90
00:06:58,459 --> 00:07:00,002
I want to kill her.

91
00:07:02,964 --> 00:07:04,006
I really do.

92
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:06,717
I want to kill her.

93
00:07:08,803 --> 00:07:11,139
Tell Jae-gu to come back.

94
00:07:11,973 --> 00:07:14,976
He's the only one
who can trample Bok-ja Park.

95
00:07:15,977 --> 00:07:18,020
He has no power.

96
00:07:19,147 --> 00:07:21,566
Father has no respect for him whatsoever.

97
00:07:21,649 --> 00:07:23,860
But still, he should know too.

98
00:07:24,318 --> 00:07:26,446
-He won't come back.
-He said he will.

99
00:07:29,073 --> 00:07:30,241
I already called him.

100
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,997
Right here. I'll get off here.

101
00:07:40,042 --> 00:07:40,918
Thank you.

102
00:07:56,642 --> 00:07:59,395
She scratched my daughter's face
and it will leave a scar.

103
00:07:59,645 --> 00:08:01,814
She even stole this doll.

104
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:03,232
I'm sorry, ma'am.

105
00:08:04,066 --> 00:08:05,860
Why on earth did you adopt that girl?

106
00:08:06,068 --> 00:08:07,778
Send her back to the orphanage!

107
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:33,239
I forgot how to walk down the aisle.

108
00:09:34,323 --> 00:09:35,783
When will Ms. Park be back?

109
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:38,619
She'll be back soon.
The wedding doesn't need to be grand.

110
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:40,037
Let's not tell many people either.

111
00:09:40,162 --> 00:09:41,539
We'll keep it simple then.

112
00:09:42,123 --> 00:09:43,708
Shall I invite the employees?

113
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:45,084
Don't tell them.

114
00:09:45,876 --> 00:09:49,755
I'll plan the wedding for you,
but please try to understand

115
00:09:50,172 --> 00:09:52,425
how the rest of the family
must be feeling now.

116
00:09:54,885 --> 00:09:55,886
We're in a position

117
00:09:56,178 --> 00:09:58,848
where we have to accept your caregiver
as a member of our family overnight.

118
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:01,684
Please give us some time
to adjust, Father.

119
00:10:02,935 --> 00:10:04,103
Yes, of course.

120
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:07,732
She's still young,
so it'll be hard for you guys

121
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:09,650
to call her Grandmother or Mother.

122
00:10:10,318 --> 00:10:12,236
Even she'll be uncomfortable with that.

123
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:14,614
A-jin.

124
00:10:15,573 --> 00:10:17,700
I trust you with everything.

125
00:10:18,909 --> 00:10:21,162
Who else can I trust in this family?

126
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:26,167
Let's accept the fact
that Father is getting married.

127
00:10:27,752 --> 00:10:30,796
He said that he'll go ahead and marry her
even if we're against it.

128
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,757
If he does that,
things will get out of hand.

129
00:10:33,174 --> 00:10:36,135
He won't consult with us on anything
from now on.

130
00:10:36,427 --> 00:10:37,345
You do have a point.

131
00:10:37,511 --> 00:10:40,431
Let's cooperate
and help him out this time.

132
00:10:40,931 --> 00:10:42,141
Gosh, this is driving me nuts.

133
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:48,064
A-jin, will you be able
to call her Mother?

134
00:10:48,397 --> 00:10:49,732
Let's worry about that later, Ju-mi.

135
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:53,027
We must stop her from getting him
wrapped around her finger.

136
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:56,656
I'd slap her if Dad wasn't around.

137
00:10:56,739 --> 00:10:58,574
I know what the two of you
are worried about.

138
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:00,868
I have an idea.

139
00:11:29,814 --> 00:11:31,482
What a pretty color.

140
00:11:32,149 --> 00:11:33,275
It's red beet tea.

141
00:11:34,276 --> 00:11:37,029
A close friend of mine
makes handmade teas.

142
00:11:37,238 --> 00:11:39,990
He repeats roasting and cooling down
semi-dried beet slices

143
00:11:40,241 --> 00:11:43,244
nine times to make this tea.

144
00:11:44,161 --> 00:11:46,831
This tea will lift up your spirits.

145
00:11:55,714 --> 00:11:57,842
Hey, partner.
Something is going on, right?

146
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:00,845
No.

147
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:03,264
I think something is going on.

148
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:06,392
I can tell that you're trying to act
like nothing's wrong.

149
00:12:08,811 --> 00:12:12,022
If it's not something that I can
help you with, it'd be a mannerless thing

150
00:12:12,189 --> 00:12:13,357
to ask you what it is,

151
00:12:14,358 --> 00:12:16,861
but I still want to know
what you're going through.

152
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:20,489
Before that, shouldn't you be asking

153
00:12:20,656 --> 00:12:22,450
why I came here to see you?

154
00:12:22,533 --> 00:12:23,826
You already told me over the phone.

155
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:27,455
You said that your father-in-law
has decided to marry his caregiver.

156
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:30,082
Did I tell you?

157
00:12:30,207 --> 00:12:31,041
That's not

158
00:12:31,542 --> 00:12:34,879
why you're so downcast today, is it?

159
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:36,130
"Partner."

160
00:12:37,381 --> 00:12:39,091
It's such a nice word.

161
00:12:39,925 --> 00:12:40,759
"Partner."

162
00:12:42,678 --> 00:12:46,348
If my partner does something bad,

163
00:12:48,517 --> 00:12:49,935
whom should I tell?

164
00:12:54,565 --> 00:12:56,108
It's about my father-in-law.

165
00:12:57,109 --> 00:12:58,360
I need your advice on something.

166
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:07,578
I can't come home today.

167
00:13:08,162 --> 00:13:10,331
You know Dr. Cha, right?
The one who opened a clinic in Busan.

168
00:13:10,706 --> 00:13:12,583
His mother-in-law passed away.

169
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:15,044
I have to attend her funeral
in Busan today.

170
00:13:21,884 --> 00:13:25,387
Your husband is seeing another woman.

171
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:50,454
When did you get back?

172
00:13:50,788 --> 00:13:53,123
Why didn't you call?
Mr. Kim could have picked you up.

173
00:13:57,628 --> 00:14:01,757
I stopped by a bakery in my hometown.

174
00:14:02,216 --> 00:14:06,053
I get serious cravings for their rice wine
pound cake from time to time.

175
00:14:07,221 --> 00:14:09,431
You should try it. Here.

176
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:15,854
It's good.

177
00:14:21,819 --> 00:14:22,820
Sir.

178
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:25,781
Living a happy life

179
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:28,701
with the person I love

180
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:32,413
has always been my wish.

181
00:14:33,998 --> 00:14:35,332
The person you love?

182
00:14:37,167 --> 00:14:38,460
I feel insecure though.

183
00:14:39,503 --> 00:14:40,379
What about?

184
00:14:42,423 --> 00:14:43,966
I'm just not sure

185
00:14:44,967 --> 00:14:48,804
if I deserve to be this happy.

186
00:14:52,141 --> 00:14:54,310
A-jin was looking for you earlier.

187
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,478
I think she wants to buy you things
for the wedding.

188
00:14:58,272 --> 00:15:00,149
She doesn't need to buy me anything.

189
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:03,986
Just do as she says.

190
00:15:11,035 --> 00:15:13,996
What on earth do they do in the room?

191
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:15,122
I know, right?

192
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:22,338
I will be home late today.
Finish your homework and go to bed.

193
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:24,423
Don't forget to take your vitamins, okay?

194
00:15:25,382 --> 00:15:26,842
I love you, my princess.

195
00:15:30,262 --> 00:15:33,432
I'm sorry to take up your time like this
since I know how busy you are.

196
00:15:33,515 --> 00:15:36,185
-It's okay.
-But please do me another favor.

197
00:15:37,186 --> 00:15:39,104
Could you be my drinking buddy today?

198
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:43,067
Why not?

199
00:15:43,984 --> 00:15:44,818
Let's go.

200
00:15:46,862 --> 00:15:49,657
Here. I'm sorry
to keep you waiting, ma'am.

201
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:52,618
I checked, but the text message
wasn't sent from a phone.

202
00:15:52,701 --> 00:15:54,870
It was sent anonymously from a computer,

203
00:15:55,162 --> 00:15:56,872
so it'll be hard to find out who sent it.

204
00:15:57,247 --> 00:15:58,165
Really?

205
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:02,294
Then, what about the call
with the blocked caller ID?

206
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:05,422
We can trace the number.
If you can prove that you were harassed,

207
00:16:05,506 --> 00:16:07,383
threatened or blackmailed in any way,

208
00:16:07,549 --> 00:16:10,135
you can request to have the number traced.

209
00:16:10,552 --> 00:16:11,887
-Is there a service like that?
-Yes.

210
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:15,599
Do you have a recording of the phone call
or anything else to prove it?

211
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:19,353
Here.

212
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:21,772
I recorded it just in case.

213
00:16:21,855 --> 00:16:25,317
Your husband is seeing another woman.

214
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:27,945
You can put in the request right away
if you have an ID on you.

215
00:16:28,112 --> 00:16:30,364
We can't really track any calls
that were received in the past,

216
00:16:30,447 --> 00:16:33,117
but if you get another call
from a blocked number

217
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,536
during the duration of the service
which is one month,

218
00:16:35,619 --> 00:16:37,371
the phone number will show up.

219
00:16:38,372 --> 00:16:39,289
Okay.

220
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:43,836
-I'd like to get the service.
-Sure.

221
00:17:03,397 --> 00:17:05,524
All right. Tell me now.

222
00:17:07,985 --> 00:17:10,738
You asked me whom you should talk to
when your partner does something bad.

223
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:16,035
You were talking about your husband,
weren't you?

224
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:20,414
Is he stressing you out?

225
00:17:22,374 --> 00:17:23,500
No, of course not.

226
00:17:25,836 --> 00:17:29,840
He's kindhearted, good-looking,
and hardworking.

227
00:17:32,509 --> 00:17:35,429
He told me that I am his sun.

228
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:37,264
He'd never stress me out.

229
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:41,185
Everyone makes mistakes.

230
00:17:41,769 --> 00:17:44,021
We all do bad things at times.

231
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:49,735
But

232
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:53,155
some people do things
knowing that they're bad.

233
00:17:53,655 --> 00:17:54,823
That's when it becomes a problem.

234
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:58,952
It hurts others too much.

235
00:17:59,536 --> 00:18:00,579
No way.

236
00:18:03,373 --> 00:18:04,416
He would have

237
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:08,712
never done it if he had known
that it would hurt me.

238
00:18:12,674 --> 00:18:14,635
There must have been a reason.

239
00:18:18,222 --> 00:18:19,515
I'm sure that there is

240
00:18:22,643 --> 00:18:24,144
a reason that I don't know about.

241
00:18:28,357 --> 00:18:29,316
Do you want to know

242
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:31,735
what the reason is?

243
00:19:07,938 --> 00:19:09,189
You drank everything.

244
00:19:12,693 --> 00:19:13,986
Gosh, I'm exhausted.

245
00:19:17,865 --> 00:19:19,074
Gosh.

246
00:19:22,494 --> 00:19:23,704
I know what you want to say.

247
00:19:24,955 --> 00:19:27,791
I'll wash up after a short snooze.

248
00:19:57,821 --> 00:19:58,822
TRY AGAIN IN 29 SECONDS

249
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:19,968
Dad. I like this car the most.

250
00:20:20,802 --> 00:20:22,971
-This car suits you best.
-Really?

251
00:20:35,817 --> 00:20:37,319
Thanks, Dad.

252
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:39,154
You'll drive carefully, right?

253
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:40,113
"Daddy"?

254
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:43,450
How ridiculous.

255
00:20:48,956 --> 00:20:50,040
Are you getting your job done?

256
00:20:50,415 --> 00:20:51,250
Yes, sir.

257
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:52,751
Do they see each other often?

258
00:20:53,335 --> 00:20:55,879
No, I think she has only met him once
since that time.

259
00:20:55,963 --> 00:20:57,297
I heard that she's there today though.

260
00:20:58,465 --> 00:20:59,508
She is there alone.

261
00:21:00,008 --> 00:21:02,386
She only sees him
when you're not at the hotel.

262
00:21:09,393 --> 00:21:11,395
You are too rude to someone

263
00:21:11,645 --> 00:21:13,647
who works in the service industry.

264
00:21:14,356 --> 00:21:15,190
Pardon?

265
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:18,151
The way you talk really irks me.

266
00:21:19,903 --> 00:21:20,904
I'll be careful from now on.

267
00:21:21,905 --> 00:21:23,532
How much time
do they usually spend together?

268
00:21:24,074 --> 00:21:26,201
Around three to four hours usually.

269
00:21:29,663 --> 00:21:32,416
Shall I put up a surveillance camera
inside the room too?

270
00:21:35,377 --> 00:21:36,211
You little...

271
00:21:37,254 --> 00:21:38,797
Gosh, this prick.

272
00:21:39,339 --> 00:21:42,175
You obnoxious piece of shit!

273
00:21:43,343 --> 00:21:46,054
Listen. Just do what I tell you to do.

274
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:48,473
If you do anything else,
I'll break all of your limbs

275
00:21:48,557 --> 00:21:51,101
so that you won't be able
to move anything besides your eyes.

276
00:21:53,854 --> 00:21:55,147
You better watch your tongue.

277
00:21:55,439 --> 00:21:56,273
What?

278
00:21:57,274 --> 00:21:59,026
Put up a camera inside the room?

279
00:21:59,484 --> 00:22:00,694
You son of a bitch.

280
00:22:01,069 --> 00:22:04,781
Are you saying I should watch my wife
doing that with another guy?

281
00:23:36,081 --> 00:23:37,040
Gosh.

282
00:23:38,458 --> 00:23:39,459
What a horrible nightmare.

283
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:42,003
Jeez, that felt so real.

284
00:23:56,017 --> 00:23:57,310
Where is my raspberry smoothie?

285
00:24:03,066 --> 00:24:04,109
Are you going to exercise?

286
00:24:04,734 --> 00:24:05,569
Yes.

287
00:24:05,819 --> 00:24:06,736
Have fun.

288
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:21,793
You pulled a tendon.

289
00:24:21,918 --> 00:24:23,753
You'll need a cast.

290
00:24:25,255 --> 00:24:28,175
Oh. no. You won't be able to exercise
for a little while.

291
00:24:28,633 --> 00:24:30,260
I need to exercise though.

292
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:41,605
Indie pink is the most popular color

293
00:24:42,189 --> 00:24:44,191
for hanbok amongst brides these days.

294
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:50,906
The color looks good on you.
Do you like it?

295
00:24:52,866 --> 00:24:56,953
Don't brides usually wear
a green jacket and a red skirt?

296
00:24:57,621 --> 00:25:00,207
Who wears green and red these days?

297
00:25:00,415 --> 00:25:03,460
No one follows that tradition anymore.
Most brides go for pastel colors.

298
00:25:05,045 --> 00:25:08,882
Red will look good on you as well,
but I think this color looks more elegant.

299
00:25:09,758 --> 00:25:10,592
Elegant?

300
00:25:11,885 --> 00:25:14,638
Let's go with this color then.

301
00:25:14,721 --> 00:25:16,306
Ivory will be a good color for the jacket.

302
00:25:17,224 --> 00:25:18,099
Okay.

303
00:25:19,643 --> 00:25:21,228
You must know my father-in-law's size.

304
00:25:21,603 --> 00:25:23,688
Yes, I do.
You'll need a blanket too, right?

305
00:25:23,939 --> 00:25:25,398
Yes, we'll order one.

306
00:25:25,649 --> 00:25:27,901
It'll be great if the hanbok can be made
as soon as possible.

307
00:25:28,193 --> 00:25:31,613
You already told me.
We'll get started right away.

308
00:25:33,406 --> 00:25:35,575
The doctor said that I pulled a tendon.

309
00:25:36,826 --> 00:25:38,328
I can't come by for the next little while.

310
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:42,332
I can't ride a bike. What excuse
will I give to sneak out in the morning?

311
00:25:45,835 --> 00:25:48,713
Yes. Let's talk again later.

312
00:25:49,214 --> 00:25:51,716
All right. I can call you later
or you can call me if you'd like.

313
00:25:53,718 --> 00:25:55,929
Will you make an announcement
about Mr. Chairman's wedding?

314
00:25:56,096 --> 00:25:58,974
Gosh, it's nothing to brag about.
There will be no announcement.

315
00:25:59,099 --> 00:26:02,102
You're saying that you won't
make it official, right?

316
00:26:03,186 --> 00:26:05,188
-All the board members know, don't they?
-Yes.

317
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:06,773
Gosh, I'm so embarrassed.

318
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:11,736
How can he be crazy about a woman
when the company isn't doing so well?

319
00:26:16,449 --> 00:26:18,618
I hurt my foot.

320
00:26:21,037 --> 00:26:23,206
Aunt Jin-hee, you look sad today.

321
00:26:25,458 --> 00:26:26,334
Do I?

322
00:26:26,793 --> 00:26:27,836
I guess I can't hide it.

323
00:26:28,253 --> 00:26:29,546
Don't be sad.

324
00:26:29,796 --> 00:26:33,049
Sadness only grows if you dwell on it.

325
00:26:35,385 --> 00:26:37,095
What should I do
to make myself feel better?

326
00:26:39,514 --> 00:26:42,017
Try to think about someone
who must be feeling worse than you.

327
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:43,685
That will make you feel a bit better.

328
00:26:44,644 --> 00:26:46,396
Someone who must be feeling worse than me?

329
00:26:54,946 --> 00:26:55,822
Ji-hu.

330
00:26:56,406 --> 00:26:57,824
Be good to your mom, okay?

331
00:26:58,825 --> 00:27:00,327
I really like your mom.

332
00:27:00,702 --> 00:27:01,536
Me too.

333
00:27:01,786 --> 00:27:05,206
My mom has a heart of gold.

334
00:27:05,623 --> 00:27:09,502
But people don't see it
because she's too pretty.

335
00:27:09,878 --> 00:27:13,757
That's right.
That's why I like her so much.

336
00:27:15,884 --> 00:27:17,427
Do you see anything you like?

337
00:27:18,011 --> 00:27:20,096
We don't really need to buy
any furniture, do we?

338
00:27:20,347 --> 00:27:23,308
You're getting married. We should buy
a new bed and wardrobe for you and Father.

339
00:27:25,477 --> 00:27:27,812
You got everything you wanted to do
in your hometown done, right?

340
00:27:28,855 --> 00:27:30,023
Almost.

341
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:32,484
How many family members
will you be inviting?

342
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,403
No one actually.

343
00:27:35,987 --> 00:27:37,197
Don't you have anyone to invite?

344
00:27:37,947 --> 00:27:40,992
Both of my parents passed away,

345
00:27:41,618 --> 00:27:44,037
and I don't speak to any of my relatives.

346
00:27:44,621 --> 00:27:45,455
I see.

347
00:27:45,997 --> 00:27:48,500
Then, we'll only invite
a few close relatives and friends.

348
00:27:50,585 --> 00:27:54,130
This wardrobe is very nice,
don't you think?

349
00:27:54,464 --> 00:27:56,591
-Do you like it?
-Yes.

350
00:27:57,675 --> 00:27:58,593
Excuse me.

351
00:28:00,387 --> 00:28:04,516
How should we address each other
after the wedding?

352
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:06,518
Good question.

353
00:28:06,976 --> 00:28:09,562
Wouldn't you feel awkward
to be called a mother-in-law overnight?

354
00:28:09,729 --> 00:28:13,858
I can call you my daughter-in-law.

355
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:16,653
I'll try too.

356
00:28:17,445 --> 00:28:19,697
There have been ups and downs,
but it's all in the past.

357
00:28:19,989 --> 00:28:21,032
Let's be on good terms.

358
00:28:21,658 --> 00:28:24,369
Please understand even if I can't
call you Mother right away.

359
00:28:25,328 --> 00:28:26,204
Of course.

360
00:28:27,205 --> 00:28:29,874
By the way, your parents will be

361
00:28:29,958 --> 00:28:32,001
attending the wedding, right?

362
00:28:32,252 --> 00:28:34,212
Yes, my mom will be coming.

363
00:28:34,337 --> 00:28:36,172
Not my dad though. He's passed away.

364
00:28:36,589 --> 00:28:39,634
-Gosh. When?
-When I was eight.

365
00:28:41,469 --> 00:28:42,637
I don't have any siblings either.

366
00:28:42,762 --> 00:28:44,347
That's why I get lonely easily.

367
00:28:44,973 --> 00:28:46,766
-I feel the same.
-Really?

368
00:28:47,684 --> 00:28:50,687
I get so sad when I'm sick.

369
00:28:50,937 --> 00:28:54,274
You probably don't know what it feels like
to have no family at all.

370
00:28:55,859 --> 00:28:57,819
I guess not.
My mom has always been there for me.

371
00:28:58,194 --> 00:28:59,696
My mom is my whole universe.

372
00:28:59,779 --> 00:29:02,115
I want to be a mom too.

373
00:29:04,951 --> 00:29:07,620
I want to be a good mom.

374
00:29:11,291 --> 00:29:14,085
Well, that's something
the two of you should decide,

375
00:29:14,836 --> 00:29:16,254
-but at Father's age...
-Gosh.

376
00:29:16,379 --> 00:29:18,882
What's wrong with his age?

377
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:21,259
Confucius' father had Confucius

378
00:29:21,551 --> 00:29:24,471
with a 20-year-old woman

379
00:29:24,596 --> 00:29:26,181
when he was 80.

380
00:29:27,515 --> 00:29:29,934
I heard that children born
to older parents

381
00:29:30,018 --> 00:29:32,270
tend to be incredibly smart.

382
00:29:45,241 --> 00:29:46,159
Are you leaving?

383
00:29:46,493 --> 00:29:47,577
Have you had dinner yet?

384
00:29:47,911 --> 00:29:48,953
I don't have much appetite.

385
00:29:49,037 --> 00:29:51,456
I made braised kimchi. Don't you like it?

386
00:29:51,748 --> 00:29:53,750
Yes, I do. Thank you.

387
00:29:54,083 --> 00:29:55,919
You must be worried about a lot of things.

388
00:29:56,336 --> 00:29:59,088
You have to eat well and stay strong
at times like this.

389
00:30:00,089 --> 00:30:03,343
Okay, I'll eat. Good job for today.
You should get going.

390
00:30:16,022 --> 00:30:18,316
MR. PARTNER

391
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:19,484
Can you call me?

392
00:30:29,869 --> 00:30:31,913
Do you feel better today?

393
00:30:33,456 --> 00:30:34,290
Yes.

394
00:30:34,624 --> 00:30:36,167
Thank you so much
for everything yesterday.

395
00:30:36,543 --> 00:30:38,086
You were a great drinking buddy.

396
00:30:38,711 --> 00:30:39,629
Don't mention it.

397
00:30:40,088 --> 00:30:41,214
It's the least I can do.

398
00:30:41,589 --> 00:30:43,591
I have all the paperwork ready.

399
00:30:43,883 --> 00:30:47,512
I must be present when they sign it,
then we have to get it notarized.

400
00:30:48,721 --> 00:30:51,224
I'm sorry, but would you be able
to come by?

401
00:30:51,307 --> 00:30:52,934
He can't really leave the house
at the moment.

402
00:30:53,017 --> 00:30:54,727
Sure. When would be good?

403
00:30:55,144 --> 00:30:58,606
Will you be able to stop by
around 8 a.m. tomorrow morning?

404
00:30:59,816 --> 00:31:00,942
That early?

405
00:31:01,192 --> 00:31:02,026
Yes.

406
00:31:03,653 --> 00:31:04,487
All right, I will.

407
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:07,532
Thank you. I'll see you tomorrow then.

408
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:09,158
Okay, see you tomorrow.

409
00:31:09,492 --> 00:31:10,618
You hang up first.

410
00:31:17,041 --> 00:31:17,959
Cheer up.

411
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:20,587
This shall pass too.

412
00:31:24,173 --> 00:31:25,049
Thank you.

413
00:31:28,386 --> 00:31:30,179
-You hang up first.
-Okay.

414
00:31:30,597 --> 00:31:31,472
I'll hang up then.

415
00:32:22,941 --> 00:32:24,484
Mom, I'm home.

416
00:32:28,446 --> 00:32:31,324
My princess.
It must have been a long day for you.

417
00:32:31,491 --> 00:32:33,534
I'll make fried rice
with an omelet on top, which you love.

418
00:32:33,618 --> 00:32:34,953
I can make the sauce quickly.

419
00:32:35,078 --> 00:32:37,246
It's okay.
I'll just have what you're eating.

420
00:32:37,914 --> 00:32:38,873
Will you?

421
00:32:39,332 --> 00:32:41,042
It's so delicious.

422
00:32:41,709 --> 00:32:43,753
-You must be hungry too. Eat with us.
-Okay.

423
00:32:45,755 --> 00:32:47,298
It smells amazing.

424
00:32:55,014 --> 00:32:57,350
Pick up Mom's favorite macarons
on your way home.

425
00:32:59,018 --> 00:33:01,270
I hurt my foot. Macarons, my ass.

426
00:33:05,358 --> 00:33:08,319
You have your art lesson tomorrow, right?

427
00:33:10,697 --> 00:33:13,574
What do you think about not taking
those lessons anymore?

428
00:33:17,412 --> 00:33:20,415
I didn't expect you to agree so easily.

429
00:33:21,332 --> 00:33:23,001
You liked taking the art lessons.

430
00:33:23,292 --> 00:33:26,921
I'm sure you're suggesting it
because you have a good reason.

431
00:33:33,219 --> 00:33:34,512
I'm sorry.

432
00:33:35,388 --> 00:33:37,432
Why are you sorry?

433
00:33:43,396 --> 00:33:44,772
DAD

434
00:33:44,856 --> 00:33:47,483
I hurt my foot,
so I can't really go anywhere.

435
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,446
Mom, Dad says that he hurt his foot.

436
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:52,905
I know.

437
00:33:54,157 --> 00:33:54,991
Mom.

438
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:56,993
Yes?

439
00:33:57,118 --> 00:33:59,203
Let's try to love Dad too.

440
00:33:59,746 --> 00:34:02,749
I don't think he feels loved enough by us.

441
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:09,589
Mom, I'm so happy that you're my mom.

442
00:34:12,133 --> 00:34:13,009
I know, right?

443
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:15,928
Aren't I the best?

444
00:34:19,015 --> 00:34:20,016
Ji-hu!

445
00:34:20,808 --> 00:34:21,726
Dad.

446
00:34:26,606 --> 00:34:27,899
-Give me a kiss.
-Ji-hu.

447
00:34:28,357 --> 00:34:31,110
Go to your room. Mom and Dad
have to talk about something.

448
00:34:31,402 --> 00:34:33,404
-Okay.
-Sweet dreams.

449
00:34:35,364 --> 00:34:36,783
Are you upset about something?

450
00:34:37,283 --> 00:34:38,117
No.

451
00:34:38,367 --> 00:34:40,453
I'm so excited that I want to dance
around the house.

452
00:34:41,829 --> 00:34:44,874
Don't lie to my face.
You look so grumpy right now.

453
00:34:45,249 --> 00:34:46,292
I told you.

454
00:34:46,793 --> 00:34:48,211
About Dad getting married,

455
00:34:48,377 --> 00:34:51,047
-just give up and come to tears...
-Make sure you're free for lunch tomorrow.

456
00:34:51,130 --> 00:34:52,799
Let's have lunch together.

457
00:34:53,758 --> 00:34:54,759
Sure, let's do that.

458
00:35:00,598 --> 00:35:01,766
Wait up.

459
00:35:09,315 --> 00:35:11,526
-Hello?
-Ms. Yun, Ji-hu can no longer

460
00:35:11,609 --> 00:35:13,069
take art lessons from you.

461
00:35:13,194 --> 00:35:14,570
My goodness. Why?

462
00:35:14,904 --> 00:35:18,449
I'd like to talk to you about it in person
around lunchtime tomorrow.

463
00:35:19,367 --> 00:35:20,409
Let's have lunch together.

464
00:35:20,910 --> 00:35:21,911
Sure, no problem.

465
00:35:28,459 --> 00:35:29,752
Oh man...

466
00:35:29,836 --> 00:35:32,088
I can't even take a shower
with my foot like this.

467
00:35:34,799 --> 00:35:38,344
You must be so sad about not being able
to ride your bike because of your foot.

468
00:35:38,427 --> 00:35:39,595
Of course.

469
00:35:39,887 --> 00:35:41,764
This is totally ruining the momentum.

470
00:35:45,101 --> 00:35:47,186
Jae-hui told me that she called Jae-gu.
Did you hear?

471
00:35:47,603 --> 00:35:49,272
Yes, I heard.

472
00:35:49,355 --> 00:35:51,649
It will be a total disaster.

473
00:35:52,817 --> 00:35:53,693
I know, right?

474
00:35:54,944 --> 00:35:55,778
Go to sleep.

475
00:35:55,903 --> 00:35:57,947
-I need to pack Ji-hu's school supplies.
-All right.

476
00:36:03,661 --> 00:36:05,580
Seong-hui.

477
00:36:05,663 --> 00:36:06,998
MR. YUN

478
00:36:12,879 --> 00:36:15,590
Don't be too sad
even if I can't see you tomorrow morning.

479
00:36:16,132 --> 00:36:17,466
Let's find another way.

480
00:36:20,970 --> 00:36:21,804
Okay.

481
00:36:22,096 --> 00:36:24,265
Let's meet at night from now on.

482
00:36:31,397 --> 00:36:32,565
You've awaken?

483
00:36:35,776 --> 00:36:37,904
-What's wrong?
-Who...

484
00:36:40,489 --> 00:36:41,532
Who did it?

485
00:36:42,116 --> 00:36:43,576
Why are you asking me?

486
00:36:43,993 --> 00:36:45,369
Shouldn't you know the answer to that?

487
00:36:47,955 --> 00:36:49,957
-Whom are you calling?
-The detective.

488
00:36:50,625 --> 00:36:53,502
He told me to call him
as soon as you wake up.

489
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:56,797
-We have to catch who did this to you.
-Don't call him.

490
00:36:56,964 --> 00:36:59,508
-Why?
-I can't really talk now.

491
00:37:00,426 --> 00:37:01,427
Call him later.

492
00:37:03,596 --> 00:37:04,764
I'll call the nurse.

493
00:37:05,181 --> 00:37:08,851
Yun-jae's skating competition is tomorrow.
I have to pack what he needs,

494
00:37:08,935 --> 00:37:10,144
so I have to go home now.

495
00:37:10,311 --> 00:37:11,979
Mother will be here starting tomorrow.

496
00:37:25,952 --> 00:37:27,870
This is Lawyer Gi-ho Kang.

497
00:37:29,789 --> 00:37:30,790
Hello.

498
00:37:31,832 --> 00:37:33,376
Ju-mi, I asked him to come by early

499
00:37:33,668 --> 00:37:35,378
so that we can get it done
when everyone is here

500
00:37:35,461 --> 00:37:37,338
before you head out to work.

501
00:37:38,256 --> 00:37:40,800
Jae-seok went into work early today
because of a meeting,

502
00:37:40,883 --> 00:37:43,219
so I'll be representing my family.

503
00:38:03,906 --> 00:38:05,199
It's your prenuptial agreement.

504
00:38:06,075 --> 00:38:09,036
I thought that it'd be a good idea
to set things in stone.

505
00:38:09,662 --> 00:38:11,122
Father, please read it over.

506
00:38:11,914 --> 00:38:12,999
You too, Ms. Park.

507
00:38:20,131 --> 00:38:21,924
PRENUPTIAL AGREEMENT

508
00:38:23,092 --> 00:38:26,345
"The wife, Bok-ja Park
will not claim any rights

509
00:38:26,429 --> 00:38:28,097
over her spouse Tae-dong Ahn's estate

510
00:38:28,264 --> 00:38:33,477
except for what he decides to give to her
following their marriage."

511
00:38:33,561 --> 00:38:34,395
Good.

512
00:38:34,478 --> 00:38:36,063
"Should any unfortunate accident happen,

513
00:38:36,147 --> 00:38:38,858
she'll also give up her right
of inheritance as his spouse entirely."

514
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:41,819
Those are the main terms of the agreement.

515
00:38:41,944 --> 00:38:45,197
It's based on Article 829
of the Civil Act,

516
00:38:45,281 --> 00:38:47,658
Agreement and Its Alteration
on Matrimonial Property.

517
00:38:47,867 --> 00:38:51,537
We'll notarize it before your wedding
with your consent.

518
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:55,458
Ms. Park, you told us

519
00:38:56,125 --> 00:38:59,045
that you only care
about protecting Father.

520
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:01,547
We believe it.

521
00:39:15,353 --> 00:39:17,521
Do I sign here?

522
00:39:18,189 --> 00:39:21,317
Gosh, I have no problem with signing this.

523
00:39:30,159 --> 00:39:32,787
What are you waiting for, sir?
You should sign it too.

524
00:39:38,542 --> 00:39:41,212
We still need to take it to the court
to get it notarized.

525
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:44,465
I'll keep a copy
of the notarization certificate.

526
00:39:44,799 --> 00:39:47,927
I witnessed the two of you
signing the agreement.

527
00:39:58,020 --> 00:39:59,855
Whose name is the reservation under?

528
00:39:59,939 --> 00:40:02,400
It should be under Ms. A-jin Woo.

529
00:40:02,525 --> 00:40:04,235
This way, please.

530
00:40:20,501 --> 00:40:23,254
Hello, where is the room reserved
under A-jin Woo?

531
00:40:23,629 --> 00:40:25,714
-This way, please.
-Thanks.

532
00:40:25,965 --> 00:40:27,967
-Please be careful.
-Why do you keep dragging me

533
00:40:28,050 --> 00:40:29,760
when I haven't even taken
my foot off the floor?

534
00:41:19,935 --> 00:41:22,104
-Please give us 30 minutes to decide.
-Sure.

535
00:41:24,982 --> 00:41:26,233
Ms. Yun.

536
00:41:27,526 --> 00:41:30,738
-Yes.
-I heard you've been seeing my husband.

537
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:33,991
Well, that's...

538
00:41:34,074 --> 00:41:35,868
A-jin, I think you got the wrong idea.

539
00:41:35,951 --> 00:41:36,827
Yes, I have.

540
00:41:38,037 --> 00:41:39,830
What does he do at your place
every morning?

541
00:41:39,914 --> 00:41:42,333
-I don't do anything. I just...
-We slept together.

542
00:41:43,542 --> 00:41:45,920
I'm sorry. Your husband and I

543
00:41:46,462 --> 00:41:47,546
love each other.

544
00:41:48,672 --> 00:41:51,383
Hey. Are you trying to give her
a heart attack or what?

545
00:41:51,467 --> 00:41:53,177
How can you be so blunt?

546
00:41:53,344 --> 00:41:54,929
Think about how it might make her feel.

547
00:41:55,012 --> 00:41:56,722
The two of us are meant to be together.

548
00:41:56,847 --> 00:41:57,765
Meant to be together?

549
00:42:01,101 --> 00:42:02,353
I'm speechless.

550
00:42:02,645 --> 00:42:05,439
Does that mean you'll keep seeing him?

551
00:42:06,482 --> 00:42:07,566
-Yes.
-No.

552
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:09,568
No, A-jin.

553
00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:11,779
-Jae-seok Ahn.
-Yes?

554
00:42:11,862 --> 00:42:13,280
This is your last chance.

555
00:42:13,405 --> 00:42:16,075
Do you want Ji-hu and me to estrange you,

556
00:42:16,158 --> 00:42:17,618
or do you want us to stay as a family?

557
00:42:18,077 --> 00:42:19,411
Make your choice now.

558
00:42:20,663 --> 00:42:22,122
Will you keep seeing her?

559
00:42:29,338 --> 00:42:30,297
No, of course not.

560
00:42:30,923 --> 00:42:33,092
You know that Father's wedding
is in two days, right?

561
00:42:33,425 --> 00:42:35,511
-Yes.
-I don't want to cause a ruckus,

562
00:42:35,594 --> 00:42:37,555
so the two of you
should put an end to this here.

563
00:42:37,638 --> 00:42:38,639
If you don't,

564
00:42:40,266 --> 00:42:41,183
you...

565
00:42:42,017 --> 00:42:44,061
-Yes.
-I'll kill you.

566
00:42:56,824 --> 00:42:59,034
I'd like to pay you for the art lessons.

567
00:43:01,203 --> 00:43:02,871
PERSONAL CHEQUE

568
00:43:11,463 --> 00:43:14,466
I got this fountain pen as a gift
when I was graduating college.

569
00:43:14,842 --> 00:43:16,719
I used to use it all the time,

570
00:43:17,011 --> 00:43:20,514
but it has become useless as it's hard
to find the ink for it these days.

571
00:43:20,598 --> 00:43:21,432
But...

572
00:43:22,224 --> 00:43:23,684
I still can't throw it out.

573
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:28,147
I signed Ji-hu's very first
report card with this,

574
00:43:28,230 --> 00:43:31,275
and I also signed
all of our real estate contracts with it.

575
00:43:31,942 --> 00:43:33,944
To me, that man is just like this pen.

576
00:43:34,111 --> 00:43:37,072
He's used and worthless,
but I'd hate to let him go

577
00:43:37,156 --> 00:43:38,699
because he has
my finger marks all over him.

578
00:43:39,116 --> 00:43:39,992
I especially

579
00:43:41,201 --> 00:43:42,578
won't let it slide

580
00:43:43,203 --> 00:43:44,830
if someone steals him from me.

581
00:43:45,914 --> 00:43:47,958
Don't try to steal
what belongs to someone else.

582
00:43:48,167 --> 00:43:49,293
Buy your own.

583
00:43:50,044 --> 00:43:52,004
Do you get what I'm saying?

584
00:43:56,091 --> 00:43:59,011
Go and ask your parents what they think.

585
00:43:59,178 --> 00:44:02,348
Tell them that you're seeing a married man
and ask them to be supportive.

586
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:03,766
-Look.
-Shut up.

587
00:44:05,100 --> 00:44:07,978
What can someone like you possibly use
to compete against me?

588
00:44:08,062 --> 00:44:09,938
Is it your looks
because you're younger than me?

589
00:44:10,105 --> 00:44:11,982
You obviously got a ton of work done
on your face.

590
00:44:12,858 --> 00:44:14,318
I only got my eyes done.

591
00:44:14,401 --> 00:44:15,569
Shut your mouth.

592
00:44:16,028 --> 00:44:18,322
-You're no better than a piece of garbage.
-Garbage?

593
00:44:19,073 --> 00:44:22,326
-You are out of line.
-Yes, I'm using harsh words,

594
00:44:22,493 --> 00:44:24,536
but if you see my husband once again,

595
00:44:24,745 --> 00:44:27,247
you'll get a lot more
than just harsh words.

596
00:44:27,790 --> 00:44:29,750
I'll make sure
that you won't even able to say

597
00:44:30,250 --> 00:44:32,961
that I'm out of line. Do you get that?

598
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:35,631
I always do what I say I'll do.

599
00:44:36,090 --> 00:44:37,883
I've always achieved everything

600
00:44:38,884 --> 00:44:40,260
that I set my mind to.

601
00:44:49,978 --> 00:44:51,897
Take your time and enjoy
your last lunch together

602
00:44:51,980 --> 00:44:52,940
over farewell drinks.

603
00:44:53,107 --> 00:44:54,441
I'm quite busy today.

604
00:44:55,734 --> 00:44:56,610
A-jin...

605
00:45:20,008 --> 00:45:20,843
I'm livid.

606
00:45:21,552 --> 00:45:23,053
I'm fuming mad right now.

607
00:45:30,477 --> 00:45:31,937
Hey, I told you not to behave this way...

608
00:45:32,604 --> 00:45:35,149
I clearly told you
not to do things like this. Jeez!

609
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:40,863
Aunt Jin-hee, can you take me
to Ms. Yun's place?

610
00:45:41,655 --> 00:45:43,615
You're not taking the art lessons anymore.

611
00:45:43,824 --> 00:45:44,783
Didn't you hear about it?

612
00:45:45,033 --> 00:45:48,495
I know that, but I left my art supplies
and sketchbook there.

613
00:45:48,871 --> 00:45:51,623
Right. I'll pick them up for you.

614
00:45:51,790 --> 00:45:53,709
No, I should say goodbye to her.

615
00:45:53,876 --> 00:45:55,586
You don't need to.

616
00:45:55,919 --> 00:45:57,379
My mom told me

617
00:45:57,504 --> 00:46:00,757
that being disrespectful to someone
just because that person isn't perfect

618
00:46:01,049 --> 00:46:03,677
makes me a worse person.

619
00:46:04,845 --> 00:46:06,388
All right. Go say goodbye to her.

620
00:46:07,639 --> 00:46:09,975
I shall see that woman's face
for one last time.

621
00:46:17,649 --> 00:46:20,319
Today will be Ji-hu's last lesson.

622
00:46:34,416 --> 00:46:36,084
-That was quick.
-Yes.

623
00:46:41,089 --> 00:46:43,634
I finished the drawing
I was working on the other day.

624
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:45,636
I gave it to Ms. Yun as a gift.

625
00:47:07,699 --> 00:47:08,575
Jae-gu!

626
00:47:11,495 --> 00:47:12,412
How have you been?

627
00:47:13,789 --> 00:47:15,916
I heard that you're getting divorced.
Did you already do it?

628
00:47:16,583 --> 00:47:18,085
Not yet. I will though.

629
00:47:18,210 --> 00:47:21,421
Our old man is getting remarried,
and you're getting divorced. What a joke.

630
00:47:21,547 --> 00:47:22,923
Our family is so dysfunctional.

631
00:47:23,006 --> 00:47:25,467
Let's hurry home. Don't you miss Un-gyu?

632
00:47:28,220 --> 00:47:29,346
Ju-mi.

633
00:47:36,186 --> 00:47:37,104
Ju-mi.

634
00:47:37,646 --> 00:47:39,731
You haven't seen him in years.
Don't be like that, please.

635
00:47:41,358 --> 00:47:44,361
Un-gyu won't be home until late.

636
00:47:45,654 --> 00:47:46,697
He's in grade 12 now.

637
00:47:47,614 --> 00:47:48,657
You know that, right?

638
00:47:51,034 --> 00:47:52,619
Dad is out with that woman.

639
00:48:20,272 --> 00:48:21,857
Who told that punk to come back?

640
00:48:32,075 --> 00:48:32,951
Get out of my house!

641
00:48:33,201 --> 00:48:34,077
Dad.

642
00:48:34,369 --> 00:48:37,039
Sir, please don't be like this.

643
00:48:37,122 --> 00:48:38,665
After your wedding,

644
00:48:39,541 --> 00:48:41,251
I'll leave with my wife and son,

645
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:43,629
but I want my share of the company stock

646
00:48:44,630 --> 00:48:46,214
and your assets.

647
00:48:46,423 --> 00:48:47,299
What?

648
00:48:47,758 --> 00:48:49,843
I already made it clear to you
that you won't get anything.

649
00:48:49,926 --> 00:48:51,970
I can sue for my legal share
of inheritance!

650
00:48:52,721 --> 00:48:53,555
Don't you know that?

651
00:48:54,514 --> 00:48:58,518
I'll get my share
after you pass away anyway.

652
00:48:58,602 --> 00:49:00,687
What did you just say? How dare you...

653
00:49:01,355 --> 00:49:02,522
Mr. Ahn.

654
00:49:03,231 --> 00:49:05,275
That is extremely out of line.

655
00:49:05,442 --> 00:49:07,569
You're aware
of Mr. Chairman's health condition.

656
00:49:07,653 --> 00:49:09,655
How can you say such a thing

657
00:49:10,197 --> 00:49:11,907
after being gone for years?

658
00:49:11,990 --> 00:49:13,617
Who are you to meddle
in our family affairs?

659
00:49:13,742 --> 00:49:14,785
Stay out of it!

660
00:49:16,119 --> 00:49:17,371
Why should I stay out of it?

661
00:49:20,123 --> 00:49:21,291
Please watch your mouth.

662
00:49:22,334 --> 00:49:25,796
Your dad and I
are getting married tomorrow.

663
00:49:26,505 --> 00:49:29,800
It means that I'll be his wife legally
as of tomorrow.

664
00:49:30,717 --> 00:49:33,011
I don't want to act like a mother to you,

665
00:49:33,136 --> 00:49:35,138
but if you're rude to Mr. Chairman

666
00:49:35,222 --> 00:49:37,182
or do anything that threatens
the peace of this family,

667
00:49:37,808 --> 00:49:40,727
I will not tolerate it.

668
00:49:42,938 --> 00:49:47,025
It looks like my dad is marrying
one special lady.

669
00:49:49,486 --> 00:49:51,071
Jae-gu, that's enough.

670
00:49:51,154 --> 00:49:54,574
I don't want to see any of you.
Get lost! Get out of my sight.

671
00:50:36,783 --> 00:50:38,994
What on earth happened to you?

672
00:50:39,453 --> 00:50:40,620
You look pathetic.

673
00:50:42,998 --> 00:50:45,709
Unexpected injuries can happen
when you work hard.

674
00:50:45,917 --> 00:50:47,252
You clumsy idiot.

675
00:50:47,627 --> 00:50:49,504
None of my children makes me proud.

676
00:50:50,797 --> 00:50:52,174
My goodness.

677
00:50:59,181 --> 00:51:02,017
Jae-gu, go get changed.
What on earth are you wearing now?

678
00:51:02,142 --> 00:51:03,435
Shut up, you punk.

679
00:51:03,643 --> 00:51:07,063
Goodness. As they say,
people don't change.

680
00:51:07,147 --> 00:51:09,441
Just be thankful
that I'm not causing a scene now.

681
00:51:10,150 --> 00:51:11,401
Gosh.

682
00:51:19,534 --> 00:51:22,287
We'd like to thank you to all of you
for joining us today

683
00:51:22,829 --> 00:51:23,872
for this special occasion.

684
00:51:41,056 --> 00:51:42,849
Where is Jae-gu staying now?

685
00:51:43,141 --> 00:51:45,101
I don't know.
I guess he's staying at a hotel.

686
00:51:45,519 --> 00:51:47,771
Tell him to just come and stay at home.

687
00:51:48,271 --> 00:51:50,690
How can I do that?
You know how much Father hates him.

688
00:51:53,443 --> 00:51:54,945
I bet you have no idea how I feel.

689
00:51:55,737 --> 00:51:58,657
You can be that laid-back and considerate

690
00:51:59,032 --> 00:52:01,076
because you have a husband
who is there for you.

691
00:52:01,159 --> 00:52:02,202
You should be grateful.

692
00:52:02,619 --> 00:52:03,954
Why do you think I'm in this mess?

693
00:52:04,454 --> 00:52:07,249
Ju-mi, why are you saying such a thing
on this happy day?

694
00:52:08,291 --> 00:52:09,835
I'm going to move out.

695
00:52:10,418 --> 00:52:11,670
I really can't take it anymore.

696
00:52:14,381 --> 00:52:15,215
Ju-mi.

697
00:52:17,008 --> 00:52:20,303
About the accident
at Father's birthday party...

698
00:52:22,639 --> 00:52:23,890
Never mind. It's nothing.

699
00:52:24,015 --> 00:52:25,809
Finish your sentence.

700
00:52:26,351 --> 00:52:29,479
We shouldn't talk about it today.
Let's talk about it another time.

701
00:52:41,116 --> 00:52:42,742
My princess, you must be tired.

702
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:44,995
Mom.

703
00:52:45,370 --> 00:52:48,290
Do I have to call her Grandma from now on?

704
00:52:49,207 --> 00:52:51,626
Well. I know that it won't be easy,

705
00:52:51,710 --> 00:52:54,087
but it'll be a polite thing to do.

706
00:52:54,963 --> 00:52:55,839
I will do so then.

707
00:53:07,267 --> 00:53:08,268
My gosh.

708
00:53:09,394 --> 00:53:12,939
I made such a difficult decision for them.
They should really be more appreciative.

709
00:53:13,064 --> 00:53:14,941
Gosh, seriously.

710
00:53:15,525 --> 00:53:18,403
Why is every woman so selfish?

711
00:53:21,656 --> 00:53:23,450
Jeez, I can't believe this.

712
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:28,079
We'll go to Europe and Bali

713
00:53:28,163 --> 00:53:31,041
when I'm fully recovered.

714
00:53:31,333 --> 00:53:32,250
Okay?

715
00:53:32,959 --> 00:53:34,002
Of course.

716
00:53:34,961 --> 00:53:38,006
But I don't have to go
to those places, sir.

717
00:53:39,215 --> 00:53:41,301
I like your accent.

718
00:53:42,427 --> 00:53:43,345
Then,

719
00:53:44,262 --> 00:53:46,348
I'll just talk with my accent

720
00:53:46,806 --> 00:53:49,976
when I'm alone with you.

721
00:53:50,226 --> 00:53:51,186
All right.

722
00:54:23,259 --> 00:54:25,929
Today, we'll work on forgiveness.

723
00:54:26,596 --> 00:54:30,266
They say that hatred
is the heaviest burden

724
00:54:30,350 --> 00:54:31,810
on our hearts.

725
00:54:32,018 --> 00:54:34,437
Today, I'd like all of us
to take some time

726
00:54:34,562 --> 00:54:37,482
to try to forgive those whom we feel

727
00:54:37,774 --> 00:54:40,610
that we absolutely can't forgive.

728
00:54:41,945 --> 00:54:43,905
All right. Please close your eyes.

729
00:54:46,199 --> 00:54:49,285
Now in your mind,
call the name of the person

730
00:54:49,911 --> 00:54:52,080
whom you really don't think
that you can forgive.

731
00:54:54,249 --> 00:54:57,669
Then, please take a few moments
to imagine that person in pain

732
00:54:58,086 --> 00:54:59,754
from the hatred and animosity

733
00:55:00,380 --> 00:55:02,966
radiating from you.

734
00:55:07,387 --> 00:55:11,766
The pain has made that person miserable.

735
00:55:13,143 --> 00:55:16,938
Now, take a good look at your heart

736
00:55:17,897 --> 00:55:20,233
and see if that has made you happier.

737
00:55:21,901 --> 00:55:24,320
I'm sure that it has made you

738
00:55:24,904 --> 00:55:26,698
as miserable.

739
00:55:29,909 --> 00:55:30,869
All right.

740
00:55:31,619 --> 00:55:32,495
Now,

741
00:55:34,164 --> 00:55:36,458
give that person a big hug.

742
00:55:37,709 --> 00:55:41,254
Try to imagine that person

743
00:55:42,338 --> 00:55:44,424
crying in your arms.

744
00:55:46,843 --> 00:55:49,971
There must have been a reason

745
00:55:51,431 --> 00:55:55,185
why that person did what he or she did.

746
00:56:34,682 --> 00:56:35,642
You're back.

747
00:56:50,031 --> 00:56:51,032
Ms. Jo.

748
00:56:53,910 --> 00:56:55,745
We should deep clean the house tomorrow.

749
00:56:56,454 --> 00:56:59,332
I do it once every two weeks
with the cleaning ladies.

750
00:56:59,707 --> 00:57:01,960
We're supposed to do it next week.

751
00:57:03,628 --> 00:57:05,463
Who says you can put it off
until next week?

752
00:57:08,508 --> 00:57:10,593
From now on,

753
00:57:11,719 --> 00:57:12,887
I will make all decisions.

754
00:57:13,263 --> 00:57:14,222
Do you understand?

755
00:57:15,890 --> 00:57:16,724
Sure, ma'am.

756
00:57:22,272 --> 00:57:24,399
Please clean the empty room upstairs,
Ms. Jo.

757
00:57:24,524 --> 00:57:26,359
Jae-gu will sleep there.

758
00:57:27,735 --> 00:57:30,029
Ms. Park, what should we do
with the room you used to use?

759
00:57:30,113 --> 00:57:34,075
We should hire someone to help Ms. Jo
now that the family has gotten bigger.

760
00:57:34,742 --> 00:57:37,745
Jae-gu is back too,
so I think that's a good idea.

761
00:57:38,413 --> 00:57:41,291
I've already found someone.

762
00:57:42,625 --> 00:57:43,460
Pardon?

763
00:57:45,837 --> 00:57:46,880
That must be her.

764
00:57:52,260 --> 00:57:56,014
Ms. Woo, whose orders should I follow
from now on?

765
00:58:11,446 --> 00:58:14,115
She's a new maid who'll be working for us.

766
00:58:14,449 --> 00:58:16,451
Say hello. This is the younger son's wife.

767
00:58:17,577 --> 00:58:18,828
Nice to meet you.

768
00:58:19,621 --> 00:58:22,999
You should have discussed this with me
before going ahead and hiring someone.

769
00:58:23,333 --> 00:58:25,627
I didn't have time to speak with you
about it, A-jin.

770
00:58:26,544 --> 00:58:27,962
Did you bring your résumé?

771
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:34,219
There's no need. She'll work for me,

772
00:58:34,344 --> 00:58:35,428
so I'll figure it out.

773
00:58:36,387 --> 00:58:40,391
I'll take care of everything
in this household from now on.

774
00:58:41,935 --> 00:58:42,936
A-jin.

775
00:58:44,646 --> 00:58:46,231
Thanks for doing so much for the family.

776
00:58:47,815 --> 00:58:50,318
Do you know when my mother-in-law's
death anniversary is?

777
00:58:50,652 --> 00:58:53,655
We also have a gardener and a helper
who comes three times a week.

778
00:58:53,780 --> 00:58:55,073
Do you have their numbers?

779
00:58:55,532 --> 00:58:57,951
Did you say you'll take care
of everything in this household?

780
00:58:58,743 --> 00:59:01,204
Are you confident about pulling it off
without my help at all?

781
00:59:04,916 --> 00:59:06,042
I'll help you,

782
00:59:06,793 --> 00:59:08,127
so take your time.

783
00:59:13,550 --> 00:59:14,467
Sure.

784
00:59:16,094 --> 00:59:17,845
I will take my time.

785
00:59:19,847 --> 00:59:21,975
All right then. Have a good day.

786
00:59:45,582 --> 00:59:47,458
I'm not Cho-hui Park anymore.

787
00:59:47,542 --> 00:59:49,544
I'm the madam of Daesung Pulp.

788
00:59:49,627 --> 00:59:52,672
I'll become your eyes and ears
as you want.

789
00:59:52,797 --> 00:59:55,633
He told me that you paid him
to hurt Bok-ja Park.

790
00:59:55,717 --> 00:59:56,759
Who is right then?

791
00:59:56,843 --> 00:59:58,636
I would have told him to kill her.

792
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:01,681
They really get on my nerves.

793
01:00:01,764 --> 01:00:03,933
-What should we do, Madam?
-Get rid of them one by one.

794
01:00:04,017 --> 01:00:05,059
I told you to get out.

795
01:00:05,143 --> 01:00:07,604
I'm going to make your room
into a karaoke and movie room.

796
01:00:07,687 --> 01:00:10,898
Why are you doing this to me? Why just me?

797
01:00:11,149 --> 01:00:14,235
Imagine if we only had a sun.
We wouldn't be able to live with that.

798
01:00:14,319 --> 01:00:16,487
Seong-hui.

799
01:00:16,571 --> 01:00:19,532
I'll live with no expectations.
This is for Ji-hu.

800
01:00:20,450 --> 01:00:23,036
If Ms. Park ever needs my help,

801
01:00:23,119 --> 01:00:25,330
I'm always willing to offer it.

802
01:00:25,413 --> 01:00:27,999
Our love hasn't ended yet.

803
01:00:28,333 --> 01:00:30,752
-Are we really going to end it here?
-Jae-seok Ahn!

804
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:32,170
You killed a man!

805
01:00:32,253 --> 01:00:34,088
You treat me like an insect!

806
01:00:35,089 --> 01:00:37,383
If you spew that kind of bullshit
once more,

807
01:00:37,592 --> 01:00:40,553
your wife and son will get kicked out too.

808
01:00:40,678 --> 01:00:42,138
This is your last warning.

809
01:00:43,181 --> 01:00:45,183
