1
00:00:44,794 --> 00:00:46,129
Today, I want my look to be...

2
00:00:46,463 --> 00:00:47,422
How should I put it?

3
00:00:47,797 --> 00:00:49,048
Natural, but put together?

4
00:00:49,257 --> 00:00:52,969
You know.
The effortless yet polished look.

5
00:00:53,052 --> 00:00:54,429
-You know what I mean, right?
-Yes.

6
00:01:29,047 --> 00:01:30,298
Yes, it's me.

7
00:01:30,465 --> 00:01:33,468
I want to make seaweed soup with oysters,
so please prepare seaweed for me.

8
00:01:33,843 --> 00:01:36,805
Please put the oysters in the fridge
with some ice cubes.

9
00:01:37,347 --> 00:01:40,183
And that radish kimchi with squid.
Please put it in the kimchi refrigerator.

10
00:01:40,266 --> 00:01:41,267
It can't ferment too much.

11
00:01:41,351 --> 00:01:43,478
When Do-hyeon gets home,
cook the marinated wagyu for him.

12
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:45,313
I'll be home around 9 p.m.

13
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,837
All right. As you can see,

14
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:11,506
which one looks more luxurious to you?

15
00:02:11,714 --> 00:02:14,676
Consumers don't care whether it has
fluorescent whitening agents.

16
00:02:15,218 --> 00:02:17,220
Facial tissues are different though.

17
00:02:17,345 --> 00:02:19,597
Using green tea and Aloe vera
in product development is great.

18
00:02:19,764 --> 00:02:21,307
They want facial tissues
to be high-quality.

19
00:02:21,391 --> 00:02:22,392
Sure, let's say I agree.

20
00:02:23,309 --> 00:02:26,729
But as for toilet paper, do we really have
to increase the unit price

21
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:29,190
just to make it free
of fluorescent whitening agents?

22
00:02:29,774 --> 00:02:32,152
Consumers are very smart
these days, Mr. Ahn.

23
00:02:32,485 --> 00:02:34,112
It was in the news recently too.

24
00:02:34,195 --> 00:02:37,699
They say that fluorescent whitening agents
contain carcinogens.

25
00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:41,786
Well, when it comes to toilet paper,

26
00:02:41,911 --> 00:02:43,413
it's mostly for number two.

27
00:02:43,913 --> 00:02:47,375
In other words, people mainly use it
to wipe their butts after pooping.

28
00:02:47,584 --> 00:02:50,461
It's not like we leave it on the skin
for an hour or two.

29
00:02:50,545 --> 00:02:53,590
The absorption rate of the skin
around the anus or the genital area

30
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:55,842
is 42 times higher
than the skin on the inner arm.

31
00:02:55,925 --> 00:02:59,804
That means such carcinogens
can be absorbed within just a few seconds.

32
00:02:59,929 --> 00:03:03,808
Plus, kids with atopic dermatitis
will be severely affected by it.

33
00:03:03,892 --> 00:03:06,603
Then, we should just put a warning label
saying such kids shouldn't use it.

34
00:03:08,187 --> 00:03:11,733
Price is the determining factor
when women are shopping for toilet paper.

35
00:03:11,816 --> 00:03:14,360
No one checks whether it has
fluorescent whitening agents.

36
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:17,655
All we need to do is win the price war.

37
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:20,450
I wholeheartedly disagree with that.

38
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:24,746
Will you be okay if your daughter
continues to use that toilet paper?

39
00:03:25,246 --> 00:03:28,291
I wouldn't need to worry about it
because my family uses a bidet.

40
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:30,168
The same goes for toilet paper for bidets.

41
00:03:30,251 --> 00:03:32,503
Jeez.

42
00:03:36,382 --> 00:03:38,843
People are not likely to spend 17,000 won
for a roll of toilet paper,

43
00:03:38,927 --> 00:03:40,595
so quality isn't important.

44
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:44,140
Our job is to provide consumers
with cheap toilet paper.

45
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:45,975
That's what I think.

46
00:03:47,602 --> 00:03:48,478
Right.

47
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:51,689
What do you think about changing
the design on our tissue box?

48
00:03:52,523 --> 00:03:55,610
-Sorry?
-We can use an artwork.

49
00:03:55,693 --> 00:03:59,155
It will look luxurious. A painting
by Matisse or Kandinsky for example.

50
00:03:59,864 --> 00:04:02,825
Well. As far as I know,
it's not legal to just take

51
00:04:03,201 --> 00:04:04,994
such an image and use it.

52
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:09,040
Then, we can use an image
of an artwork by an artist I know.

53
00:04:09,624 --> 00:04:10,667
It's pop art.

54
00:05:04,429 --> 00:05:07,015
We have a new member
who is joining us starting today.

55
00:05:07,098 --> 00:05:09,559
Meet Lawyer Gi-ho Kang.
Let's welcome him with applause.

56
00:05:11,644 --> 00:05:14,105
It's nice to meet you all. I'm Gi-ho Kang.

57
00:05:14,272 --> 00:05:16,566
From issues related to divorce,
inheritance, and fraud

58
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:18,401
to even noise issues with neighbors,

59
00:05:18,735 --> 00:05:21,529
I can take care
of any types of litigation.

60
00:05:23,656 --> 00:05:25,658
-I'm Lawyer Gi-ho Kang.
-Hello.

61
00:05:26,034 --> 00:05:27,327
-I'm Lawyer Gi-ho Kang.
-Hello.

62
00:05:28,369 --> 00:05:29,370
Hello, Ms. Baek.

63
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:30,747
I'm Lawyer Gi-ho Kang.

64
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:32,665
I'm Gi-ho Kang.

65
00:05:33,249 --> 00:05:34,292
Today,

66
00:05:35,626 --> 00:05:38,046
you'll partner up with the person
sitting next to you

67
00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:41,549
and tell your partner ten reasons
why he or she should exist in this world.

68
00:05:41,632 --> 00:05:45,053
After that, you'll share it with us
in your own terms.

69
00:06:01,652 --> 00:06:02,987
You can start first.

70
00:06:05,656 --> 00:06:06,491
Well...

71
00:06:06,824 --> 00:06:07,742
By the way,

72
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:11,579
do you always wear so much makeup?

73
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:14,332
Even your hair. You're all done up.

74
00:06:14,707 --> 00:06:17,335
You're even wearing fake eyelashes
in a meditation class.

75
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:22,548
I have an interview
with a newspaper editor right after this.

76
00:06:22,632 --> 00:06:23,591
What's the interview for?

77
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,635
Do I have to tell you?

78
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:27,136
Not really.

79
00:06:28,179 --> 00:06:31,265
Even when I'm wearing
only a little of makeup, it really shows.

80
00:06:31,349 --> 00:06:33,851
When I stop by a place,
people think they've seen me ten times.

81
00:06:34,143 --> 00:06:37,522
How should I put this?
I have a strong presence.

82
00:06:40,983 --> 00:06:42,026
Are you married?

83
00:06:42,652 --> 00:06:44,946
-Yes.
-You must not like seeing her with makeup.

84
00:06:45,029 --> 00:06:47,490
-That's right.
-Are you wondering how I knew it?

85
00:06:48,282 --> 00:06:50,618
-Yes.
-I could tell earlier.

86
00:06:50,701 --> 00:06:53,955
The way you talk has no depth,
and you're easy to read.

87
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:58,835
If you see her going out
wearing a lot of makeup,

88
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:01,087
don't say anything negative
and just compliment her.

89
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:05,258
Tell her, "You're pretty."

90
00:07:05,758 --> 00:07:07,510
"Why are you wearing so much makeup?"

91
00:07:07,635 --> 00:07:09,137
Don't say things like that.

92
00:07:10,179 --> 00:07:11,055
Okay.

93
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:15,518
Let's get started now.
Tell me the reasons I should exist.

94
00:07:20,773 --> 00:07:22,066
You're pretty.

95
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:24,110
You're pretty.

96
00:07:25,153 --> 00:07:26,154
You're pretty.

97
00:07:34,871 --> 00:07:37,623
When we say that we know someone well,

98
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:40,668
how much do we really know

99
00:07:41,043 --> 00:07:43,045
about that person?

100
00:08:00,563 --> 00:08:04,400
Knowing someone can be a blessing,

101
00:08:05,026 --> 00:08:06,694
but it can also be a curse at times.

102
00:08:10,198 --> 00:08:11,574
I'll pay you back.

103
00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:15,369
I'll definitely pay you back
before the end of the month,

104
00:08:15,453 --> 00:08:16,704
so please give me some more time.

105
00:08:17,538 --> 00:08:18,414
Yes.

106
00:08:18,664 --> 00:08:21,250
Relationships that start
without any foretelling signs or motives

107
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:22,668
are always right.

108
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:24,086
However...

109
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:26,214
I said I'll pay you back.

110
00:08:30,635 --> 00:08:33,471
Every person and object
eventually encounters a moment

111
00:08:33,596 --> 00:08:36,599
when their true colors are revealed.

112
00:08:37,058 --> 00:08:37,975
Goodness.

113
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:39,810
I shouldn't wipe my butt with this.

114
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:45,191
I told you that I'll pay you back.
I'll pay you back in full.

115
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:49,153
Listen. I'm going to pay you
all the overdue interest as well...

116
00:08:52,073 --> 00:08:54,617
When your cover is blown,

117
00:08:54,951 --> 00:08:57,119
you must act promptly
to conceal your true colors again.

118
00:08:57,203 --> 00:08:58,454
I'll call you back.

119
00:08:59,622 --> 00:09:03,626
Otherwise, it'll hinder you
from arriving at your goal.

120
00:09:07,171 --> 00:09:09,090
I love this class so much.

121
00:09:09,173 --> 00:09:11,592
Do you know how happy it makes me?

122
00:09:11,842 --> 00:09:13,386
Did you like your partner?

123
00:09:13,511 --> 00:09:15,137
Jin-kyung said

124
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:17,139
that even someone's wrong deed

125
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:19,517
helps us define our values,

126
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,352
so that person should exist too.

127
00:09:21,936 --> 00:09:24,146
In that regard, I liked him.

128
00:09:25,356 --> 00:09:27,191
He's been through a lot.

129
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:30,069
When he was 25,
he lost his wife in a car accident

130
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:34,490
on their way to their honeymoon.
His parents passed away too.

131
00:09:34,699 --> 00:09:36,242
That's why he got a military exemption.

132
00:10:51,275 --> 00:10:53,694
-Father, she is...
-Sir.

133
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:55,863
You have a kinesiotherapy session
today, right?

134
00:10:57,573 --> 00:10:58,574
Ms. Park.

135
00:10:58,824 --> 00:11:01,494
Please call Mr. Kim.

136
00:11:01,577 --> 00:11:03,120
He probably doesn't know about it.

137
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:05,456
I'll go with Mr. Chairman.

138
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:11,921
I'm originally from Chungcheong Province,

139
00:11:12,129 --> 00:11:13,964
but I've been living in Seoul
for a long time,

140
00:11:14,131 --> 00:11:16,550
so I can switch
between the two dialects freely.

141
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:20,262
Do you prefer me talking like this?

142
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:26,185
This is much better, isn't it?

143
00:11:26,268 --> 00:11:27,728
Right, I think so too.

144
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:30,439
I'm much more comfortable this way too.

145
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:43,494
Weren't you going
to tell me something earlier?

146
00:11:55,756 --> 00:11:56,966
Is Seong-su in surgery now?

147
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:58,676
Yes.

148
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:00,511
This is for you guys.

149
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:03,597
Give this to him
when he is out of the surgery.

150
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:06,684
He was craving rice punch
out of the blue this morning.

151
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:11,105
-I should get going.
-Bye.

152
00:12:14,191 --> 00:12:16,485
They say you're always the last
to find out

153
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:17,778
when your husband cheats on you.

154
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:20,281
She is exactly in that situation now.

155
00:12:21,115 --> 00:12:22,867
We should just eat this, right?

156
00:12:24,493 --> 00:12:27,037
Book Hye-yeong Jeong at 2 p.m. next week
for bimaxillary osteotomy.

157
00:12:27,121 --> 00:12:28,581
And watch what you say, okay?

158
00:12:29,331 --> 00:12:31,709
I should text Dr. Jang.

159
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:34,044
DONG-JAE'S MOM

160
00:12:34,128 --> 00:12:36,297
Hui-seop and Yun-ji enrolled
in Eureka Math Institute.

161
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:50,102
My goodness.

162
00:12:53,564 --> 00:12:54,565
You have something here.

163
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:03,574
Hui-seop and Yun-ji enrolled
in Eureka Math Institute.

164
00:13:03,657 --> 00:13:06,577
Your wife just came by.
She brought rice punch for you

165
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:08,204
to drink after surgery.

166
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:23,677
We need to meet up urgently.

167
00:13:23,844 --> 00:13:25,262
Thanks for the rice punch, dear.

168
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:30,518
Ji-hu, look.
This is a three-dimensional object,

169
00:13:30,601 --> 00:13:32,019
but your drawing is two-dimensional.

170
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:34,438
How can you convey the depth
in your drawing?

171
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:37,566
You can do it by capturing
the light and shadows.

172
00:13:38,984 --> 00:13:39,902
Look.

173
00:13:40,569 --> 00:13:42,696
-What do you think? Isn't it different?
-Yes.

174
00:13:43,197 --> 00:13:45,950
Who is going to pick you up today?
Whom should I call?

175
00:13:46,116 --> 00:13:47,368
Aunt Jin-hee.

176
00:13:47,576 --> 00:13:48,410
Okay.

177
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:57,211
I explained everything to Ms. Baek
and asked her to reconsider it.

178
00:13:57,378 --> 00:13:59,421
I told her about him being reprimanded
for school violence

179
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:00,965
and currently being treated for ADHD.

180
00:14:01,131 --> 00:14:02,550
I said my son is scared of him too.

181
00:14:02,633 --> 00:14:03,842
What did she say after that?

182
00:14:04,552 --> 00:14:06,637
She said it doesn't matter
as they aren't in the same class.

183
00:14:07,596 --> 00:14:11,642
Hui-seop is one thing, but isn't Yun-ji
the one with the lowest grades?

184
00:14:11,725 --> 00:14:14,895
How can we send our kids
to the same math institute as them?

185
00:14:19,233 --> 00:14:20,776
Say something, A-jin.

186
00:14:22,027 --> 00:14:23,654
She's not trying
to put them in the same class.

187
00:14:23,737 --> 00:14:25,155
Aren't we being too sensitive?

188
00:14:25,447 --> 00:14:27,408
It's not like they have
a contagious disease.

189
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:28,909
Who cares?

190
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:31,412
A-jin, that's not what
we're talking about now.

191
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:34,164
Did you all get good grades in school?

192
00:14:34,915 --> 00:14:37,793
Is Hui-seop the only kid
who is showing ADHD symptoms?

193
00:14:38,627 --> 00:14:41,714
Why are we trying to send our kids
to the specialized middle school?

194
00:14:41,964 --> 00:14:44,300
Let's be honest. Haven't you heard
about arranged marriages

195
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:46,218
among graduates of such schools?

196
00:14:46,468 --> 00:14:49,471
Why do you think their parents make them
only hang out with high school alumni

197
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:51,098
even after entering
prestigious universities?

198
00:14:51,432 --> 00:14:52,766
Why do they do that?

199
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:56,812
A-jin, Ji-hu should quit too.

200
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:59,231
-I'll try to find a good tutor.
-I don't want to do that.

201
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:01,442
Ji-hu's grades have gone up,

202
00:15:01,609 --> 00:15:03,944
and A-jin is closer to Ms. Baek
than any of us are.

203
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:05,279
It won't be easy for her.

204
00:15:07,448 --> 00:15:10,618
Both Do-hyeon and Su-min go there.
I'll move them elsewhere.

205
00:15:11,076 --> 00:15:14,038
There is a spot in the advanced class
at LCL, so I'll move Do-hyeon there.

206
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:16,707
And I want Su-min to get tutored
with your kids.

207
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:18,542
That's what I've decided to do.

208
00:15:19,001 --> 00:15:20,294
I'll stay.

209
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:21,378
I'm quitting.

210
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:22,755
Me too.

211
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:28,052
Then, Ji-hu will be the only one left
in the class.

212
00:15:28,135 --> 00:15:31,013
No. Ms. Baek's son, In-jae
and Ji-hu will be the only ones left.

213
00:15:35,142 --> 00:15:37,269
Okay. The tutoring sessions
should be at my place, right?

214
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:39,772
Why don't we take turns each month?

215
00:15:39,855 --> 00:15:41,732
The three of us should talk about it
another time.

216
00:16:10,594 --> 00:16:13,847
Ju-mi. You should've turned the light on.
Why are you sitting alone in the dark?

217
00:16:14,181 --> 00:16:15,265
Have you been drinking?

218
00:16:15,349 --> 00:16:16,934
Wine doesn't even count as alcohol.

219
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:18,894
Do you want a glass too?

220
00:16:19,687 --> 00:16:20,604
Ju-mi.

221
00:16:20,729 --> 00:16:23,232
Let's not drink at home.
Why don't we go out?

222
00:16:23,315 --> 00:16:24,233
Forget it.

223
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:27,820
There are no tent bars in Gangnam.

224
00:16:30,614 --> 00:16:33,325
I really want to go to a tent bar today.

225
00:16:34,201 --> 00:16:36,870
Chicken gizzards and fish roe soup.

226
00:16:38,038 --> 00:16:40,541
I also want to eat the cheap udon
that comes in a plastic container.

227
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:45,754
We can go. Let's go to Hongdae.

228
00:16:45,921 --> 00:16:47,548
Let's drink all night.

229
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:49,049
Shall we?

230
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:50,843
Really?

231
00:16:52,261 --> 00:16:53,971
All right, let's do it.

232
00:16:55,931 --> 00:16:58,642
By the way,
I know that Ms. Jo is off today,

233
00:16:58,726 --> 00:17:00,644
but where are Ms. Park and Father?

234
00:17:02,062 --> 00:17:03,230
They are out on a date.

235
00:17:14,366 --> 00:17:15,451
What is Ji-hu doing?

236
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:18,746
She is doing her English homework.
She doesn't even waste a minute.

237
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:21,415
I'm like that too.
I never waste any of my time.

238
00:17:21,915 --> 00:17:24,293
I mean, why do you think I came here
instead of Jin-hee?

239
00:17:27,212 --> 00:17:29,506
To me, this moment is very...

240
00:17:30,966 --> 00:17:32,801
This is such a meaningful moment for me.

241
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:34,803
Thank you.

242
00:17:37,097 --> 00:17:38,057
Give me a cup of tea.

243
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:40,601
I won't want to leave
if I eat tteok-bokki again.

244
00:17:41,769 --> 00:17:43,395
I made potato pancakes.

245
00:17:50,861 --> 00:17:54,281
Everything in Insa-dong
closes at night like this,

246
00:17:54,364 --> 00:17:56,116
so there is nowhere to go for food.

247
00:17:57,117 --> 00:17:58,285
Back in the day,

248
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:00,788
poetry recitation competitions
used to be held here.

249
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:03,832
Poetry is great.

250
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:05,626
Sir.

251
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:07,586
Do you like poetry?

252
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:10,339
Yes, I do.

253
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:16,845
"Meadow, meadow, golden meadow.

254
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:19,681
The burning fire
in the deep mountain valley

255
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:22,726
is the golden meadow
by the grave of my beloved.

256
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:25,854
Spring is here. Spring light has come

257
00:18:28,398 --> 00:18:31,235
to the tip of the willow
and onto its thin branches.

258
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:34,613
The spring light has come.
The spring day has come

259
00:18:35,697 --> 00:18:38,826
to the deep mountain valley
and on the golden meadow."

260
00:18:40,911 --> 00:18:42,663
It's a poem by So-wol Kim.

261
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:45,165
I asked you just out of curiosity.

262
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:49,253
How do you have the entire poem memorized?

263
00:18:51,046 --> 00:18:55,008
I only have a middle school diploma.

264
00:18:55,551 --> 00:18:58,887
I delivered newspapers to earn money
to put my siblings through school,

265
00:18:59,721 --> 00:19:01,265
and it embarrassed me so much.

266
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:03,225
So,

267
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:07,354
I stole my friend's
high school Korean textbook.

268
00:19:07,771 --> 00:19:09,606
I carried it with me all the time

269
00:19:10,315 --> 00:19:12,484
and pretended that I was
a high school student.

270
00:19:13,026 --> 00:19:15,779
Then one day, I happened to read
a few pages in the textbook,

271
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:18,490
and I was deeply moved by the poem.

272
00:19:20,701 --> 00:19:23,412
I read it so many times
that I ended up memorizing it.

273
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:28,292
Ms. Park.

274
00:19:29,751 --> 00:19:31,879
-Yes, sir.
-You don't need to try so hard.

275
00:19:33,088 --> 00:19:35,215
Don't pretend to be who you're not
like what I did.

276
00:19:35,757 --> 00:19:39,344
Just keep your native accent.

277
00:19:40,387 --> 00:19:44,683
You don't need to try so hard
to sound like a Seoul native.

278
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:49,146
Let's head home now.

279
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:52,149
I need to take my medication.

280
00:19:54,276 --> 00:19:55,777
Shall we head back, sir?

281
00:19:56,653 --> 00:19:59,656
I'll call Mr. Kim then.

282
00:20:00,657 --> 00:20:02,910
All right, sure.

283
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:08,498
My feelings for Chairman Ahn

284
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:10,876
weren't entirely fake.

285
00:20:11,752 --> 00:20:12,753
On some days,

286
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:16,590
I felt horrible
for what I was doing to him,

287
00:20:17,966 --> 00:20:19,927
and there were also times
when I almost teared up

288
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:22,638
because of how much he cared for me.

289
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:27,059
Nothing in this world is perfectly fake

290
00:20:27,601 --> 00:20:30,979
or perfectly real.

291
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:36,526
KARAOKE

292
00:20:44,201 --> 00:20:45,327
Let's go.

293
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:48,747
Bye, Ms. Yun.

294
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:49,998
Bye, Ji-hu.

295
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:51,250
Take care, Ms. Yun.

296
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:53,210
Goodbye, Mr. Ahn.

297
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:56,338
Let's go.

298
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:22,614
THE ART OF SEDUCTION

299
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:39,256
Ji-hu, take your earphones off.
Let's listen to it together.

300
00:21:39,881 --> 00:21:41,508
Tune to 91.3FM.

301
00:21:41,591 --> 00:21:43,427
All right, 91.3.

302
00:21:48,265 --> 00:21:52,352
Why do you like to listen to music
that was popular before I was born?

303
00:21:52,519 --> 00:21:53,687
You're such an old soul.

304
00:21:55,564 --> 00:21:59,192
Why did God abandon me
if he really exists?

305
00:22:00,027 --> 00:22:01,945
I'm all alone again.

306
00:22:02,195 --> 00:22:03,030
Goodness.

307
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:07,242
That's how life is.
We keep getting betrayed by God.

308
00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:09,328
And all of us are in it alone.

309
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:12,289
Ji-hu, why do you think so?

310
00:22:12,414 --> 00:22:13,999
You're only ten, so act your age.

311
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:16,626
You need to look at the world
like other ten-year-old kids do.

312
00:22:16,793 --> 00:22:20,130
The fact that I'm young
doesn't change how the world is.

313
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:23,925
If I dismiss the reality just because
I'm young, when it hits me one day...

314
00:22:24,217 --> 00:22:27,387
Like Mom always says,
it'll be a total disaster.

315
00:22:27,471 --> 00:22:28,972
Let's say that this is like a warm-up.

316
00:22:30,807 --> 00:22:33,769
You need to watch some cartoons

317
00:22:33,852 --> 00:22:36,354
to dumb yourself down.

318
00:22:36,897 --> 00:22:39,024
And don't listen to music like this.

319
00:22:40,275 --> 00:22:44,529
Yes, this is better. Listen to songs
that make you stop thinking.

320
00:22:44,613 --> 00:22:45,530
Isn't this nice?

321
00:22:45,697 --> 00:22:48,784
That's what dictators did
in the medieval times.

322
00:22:49,076 --> 00:22:52,788
They encouraged cultural development
to divert people's attention.

323
00:22:52,913 --> 00:22:54,831
They wanted their people
to become mindless.

324
00:22:56,833 --> 00:22:58,877
I'm not saying
that's what you're doing, Dad.

325
00:22:59,002 --> 00:23:01,546
Regardless of their intentions,
the cultural development initiated

326
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:03,799
by those dictators will be remembered
forever in history.

327
00:23:06,134 --> 00:23:09,054
Do you ever watch cartoons?
Like Doraemon for example.

328
00:23:09,429 --> 00:23:10,680
Yes, I like it.

329
00:23:11,264 --> 00:23:12,224
Thank goodness.

330
00:23:12,599 --> 00:23:15,477
Doraemon should have met Shin Chan

331
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:17,104
instead of Nobita.

332
00:23:17,479 --> 00:23:19,481
Then, he shouldn't have been able
to act out like that.

333
00:23:25,487 --> 00:23:26,446
Hello?

334
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:44,131
Ms. Park, it must have been
a long day for you.

335
00:23:44,381 --> 00:23:45,465
Go get some rest now.

336
00:23:47,175 --> 00:23:49,344
Get a good sleep and rest up, sir.

337
00:23:49,761 --> 00:23:50,637
All right.

338
00:23:57,978 --> 00:23:58,937
I'd like

339
00:24:00,188 --> 00:24:01,940
to thank you for everything today.

340
00:24:15,745 --> 00:24:16,788
Jae-seok.

341
00:24:18,331 --> 00:24:21,084
-Hello, Ju-mi.
-Yes, hello.

342
00:24:23,837 --> 00:24:24,880
A-jin.

343
00:24:25,589 --> 00:24:26,464
Let's go home.

344
00:24:27,048 --> 00:24:27,924
My gosh.

345
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:29,342
Look who is here.

346
00:24:29,593 --> 00:24:30,510
Jae-seok?

347
00:24:32,179 --> 00:24:33,430
You're a cutie.

348
00:24:34,931 --> 00:24:36,224
Let's talk at home.

349
00:24:36,725 --> 00:24:39,728
Hey, did you say hello to Ju-mi?

350
00:24:40,061 --> 00:24:41,897
A-jin, let's go home now.

351
00:24:42,772 --> 00:24:45,692
Ju-mi, you see this guy's face?

352
00:24:45,775 --> 00:24:49,070
His personality is even worse.

353
00:24:49,237 --> 00:24:51,656
Let's get going if you don't want
to see me losing it. I'll carry you.

354
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:54,492
Gosh, I don't need to be carried.

355
00:24:55,202 --> 00:24:57,954
Let me have one more drink. Just one more.

356
00:24:58,038 --> 00:25:00,790
For God's sake. Ji-hu is in the car now.

357
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:04,461
Ji-hu is in the car?

358
00:25:07,088 --> 00:25:08,506
Then, I should sober up.

359
00:25:09,966 --> 00:25:11,259
Both of you, follow me.

360
00:25:12,469 --> 00:25:14,512
Hey, wait. Where should we follow you?

361
00:25:14,596 --> 00:25:16,681
A-jin, where are you going?

362
00:25:39,287 --> 00:25:42,374
The trees on the street should thank you
for all the fertilizer you gave them.

363
00:25:43,833 --> 00:25:45,627
I'm going to wash up.
You should leave for work now.

364
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:46,753
Gosh.

365
00:25:47,337 --> 00:25:49,506
I'll go say hello to the caregiver
before I head to work.

366
00:25:49,881 --> 00:25:52,509
Mr. Kim said that she has been taking
such great care of Dad.

367
00:25:52,842 --> 00:25:54,886
There's no need. I have to fire her.

368
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:57,472
Hey, is this some kind
of mind game or what?

369
00:25:57,597 --> 00:25:59,891
You say that every time
I'm heading there to meet her.

370
00:26:00,016 --> 00:26:03,228
Gosh. I have no choice
because Ju-mi absolutely can't stand her.

371
00:26:03,436 --> 00:26:05,188
Gosh, I can't say it to her.

372
00:26:05,272 --> 00:26:07,107
And where am I going
to find another caregiver?

373
00:26:08,316 --> 00:26:11,194
I think I'm experiencing déjà vu.
This is exactly the same as last time.

374
00:26:11,486 --> 00:26:12,570
This is called déjà vu, right?

375
00:26:24,124 --> 00:26:25,625
I'm going to work, Father.

376
00:26:26,543 --> 00:26:28,753
All right. Have a good day.

377
00:26:40,056 --> 00:26:42,934
Sir, please try moving your legs now.

378
00:26:48,732 --> 00:26:51,401
I feel like I'll be able to run
in no time.

379
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:53,361
Really?

380
00:26:54,738 --> 00:26:55,572
Let me help you.

381
00:26:59,826 --> 00:27:00,702
Good job.

382
00:27:03,997 --> 00:27:04,998
Put your arm around me.

383
00:27:06,291 --> 00:27:07,125
Oh god.

384
00:27:22,724 --> 00:27:23,683
Sir.

385
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,731
Let's dance.

386
00:27:30,273 --> 00:27:31,107
Dance?

387
00:28:48,977 --> 00:28:50,770
That day, the three of us

388
00:28:51,187 --> 00:28:54,858
felt the most beautiful sentiments
God has given us

389
00:28:55,358 --> 00:28:57,026
while looking at each other.

390
00:28:57,736 --> 00:29:00,029
It was a heartwarming day

391
00:29:00,947 --> 00:29:04,117
for both me and her.

392
00:29:14,669 --> 00:29:17,297
So? Does that mean you've decided
not to fire the caregiver?

393
00:29:17,505 --> 00:29:19,549
-Yes.
-I think you've made the right decision.

394
00:29:19,632 --> 00:29:21,676
You have such a warm heart.

395
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:24,721
Right. My husband suggested
using one of your artworks

396
00:29:24,804 --> 00:29:27,223
for the design of our tissue box.

397
00:29:27,307 --> 00:29:30,059
-Really?
-I think you'll be paid royalties.

398
00:29:30,185 --> 00:29:32,604
I asked him to include your name
in the design

399
00:29:32,687 --> 00:29:34,230
to help you get your name out there.

400
00:29:34,314 --> 00:29:37,525
I don't need any royalties.
I should pay the company if anything.

401
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:41,154
He asked me to pick a painting.
Please e-mail me photos of your paintings.

402
00:29:41,738 --> 00:29:45,366
It looks like your husband discusses
a lot of work matters with you.

403
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:47,035
Gosh, of course.

404
00:29:47,118 --> 00:29:49,579
Our household can't function without me.

405
00:29:49,746 --> 00:29:52,248
The company will launch
menstrual pads soon.

406
00:29:52,332 --> 00:29:55,126
It'll be extremely high-quality.
It was my idea.

407
00:29:56,461 --> 00:29:59,214
-I see.
-You've never met my husband, right?

408
00:29:59,464 --> 00:30:02,342
Why? I met him
when he came to pick up Ji-hu.

409
00:30:02,884 --> 00:30:06,721
Right. Let's have a meal together soon.
We need to talk about the design anyway.

410
00:30:07,222 --> 00:30:08,056
Okay.

411
00:30:08,139 --> 00:30:10,391
Go in now. The director must be waiting.

412
00:30:11,684 --> 00:30:15,396
For your information, she doesn't like
artists who are outspoken.

413
00:30:15,605 --> 00:30:17,148
He has been burnt before.

414
00:30:20,109 --> 00:30:22,779
"She's been good at mental arithmetic
since she was very young,

415
00:30:22,862 --> 00:30:25,406
so I focused on helping her
further develop the talent."

416
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:29,160
"My goal for her
is to have a higher EQ than IQ."

417
00:30:29,244 --> 00:30:32,038
"Emotional thinking is more important
than logical thinking at her age,

418
00:30:32,121 --> 00:30:36,000
but I got her to take the test so that
she can learn to challenge herself."

419
00:30:36,876 --> 00:30:38,378
For goodness' sake.

420
00:30:38,545 --> 00:30:39,963
She's so pretentious.

421
00:30:40,255 --> 00:30:43,007
I really can't stand
how pretentious A-jin is.

422
00:30:43,633 --> 00:30:46,511
A-jin Woo.
I have to admit that she is very pretty.

423
00:30:46,719 --> 00:30:47,929
Isn't her beauty on another level?

424
00:30:48,972 --> 00:30:51,182
I wouldn't say she's pretty.
She got work done on her face.

425
00:30:51,266 --> 00:30:53,560
Hate her if you want to,
but don't slander her name.

426
00:30:53,893 --> 00:30:55,061
She's all natural.

427
00:30:55,478 --> 00:30:58,231
Besides, it's not easy to become pretty
even with plastic surgery procedures.

428
00:30:58,356 --> 00:31:02,318
Plastic surgeons can't work their magic
when you're hopelessly ugly.

429
00:31:07,031 --> 00:31:08,950
I know what you did in Suite 702.

430
00:31:19,252 --> 00:31:21,296
I must have a natural talent for this.

431
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:24,007
You sure do.

432
00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:26,342
-Isn't this so pretty?
-It is really pretty.

433
00:31:26,426 --> 00:31:27,510
I should start a business.

434
00:31:28,011 --> 00:31:29,387
I think that's a great idea.

435
00:31:29,846 --> 00:31:31,472
Where were we? Finish your story.

436
00:31:32,849 --> 00:31:34,100
Like I told you,

437
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:37,353
Yun-jae's mom went
to Dr. Jang's clinic for fat grafting,

438
00:31:37,645 --> 00:31:39,981
and the two of them fell for each other.

439
00:31:40,773 --> 00:31:42,317
What a disaster.

440
00:31:42,650 --> 00:31:44,152
Here is the latest hot news for you.

441
00:31:44,402 --> 00:31:46,321
It's about Ji-hu's violin teacher.

442
00:31:46,487 --> 00:31:49,824
She went clubbing
for the first time in her life

443
00:31:49,908 --> 00:31:51,492
and met a guy there.

444
00:31:52,035 --> 00:31:55,079
Apparently, they've realized
that they are each other's true love.

445
00:31:55,455 --> 00:31:56,748
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

446
00:31:57,248 --> 00:31:59,167
I only heard about it yesterday.
Pung-suk told me.

447
00:31:59,417 --> 00:32:02,754
I can't let someone like her teach Ji-hu.
That's crazy.

448
00:32:03,338 --> 00:32:04,589
Why can't you?

449
00:32:04,797 --> 00:32:06,883
That story is scandalous.

450
00:32:07,383 --> 00:32:08,843
What about it is scandalous?

451
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:10,887
They say that artists' loose morals prove

452
00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:12,805
the existence
of their artistic creativity.

453
00:32:13,306 --> 00:32:15,558
Besides, she's divorced anyway.

454
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:17,268
What's wrong with her dating a guy?

455
00:32:18,603 --> 00:32:20,021
That is true.

456
00:32:21,564 --> 00:32:25,234
But it sounds funny to me
that she met her true love

457
00:32:25,401 --> 00:32:26,486
at a club.

458
00:32:27,278 --> 00:32:29,864
It was that guy's first time
going clubbing too.

459
00:32:31,157 --> 00:32:33,785
There's nothing romantic
about where they first met, but...

460
00:32:35,495 --> 00:32:38,539
I feel like it's been 5,000 years
since the last time I went clubbing.

461
00:32:38,623 --> 00:32:39,749
I miss it.

462
00:32:40,124 --> 00:32:42,251
I used to go clubbing all the time
before I got married.

463
00:32:42,335 --> 00:32:44,671
I still remember the names of the waiters
at Hotel Infra's club.

464
00:32:44,754 --> 00:32:46,756
Ho-sik, Sam-dol, and Charles.

465
00:32:47,715 --> 00:32:51,344
They could earn a living thanks to me.
I wonder what kind of work they do now.

466
00:32:52,261 --> 00:32:55,807
They used to grab my wrist like this
and drag me around the club.

467
00:32:58,059 --> 00:33:00,478
One more thing. Do you want to hear
something totally crazy?

468
00:33:00,561 --> 00:33:02,313
-What is it?
-You know Su-min's mom, right?

469
00:33:02,397 --> 00:33:04,315
-The wife of Grand Pix Hotels' CEO.
-Yes.

470
00:33:05,733 --> 00:33:07,068
Bring some cold green tea.

471
00:33:07,235 --> 00:33:08,861
I want to pour it
over rice and dried corvina.

472
00:33:09,153 --> 00:33:12,323
I heard that he bought his mistress
a house and a car,

473
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:13,825
and she even visits him at home.

474
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:15,201
Gosh, are you serious?

475
00:33:16,369 --> 00:33:20,206
The problem is his wife knows about it,
but she's just putting up with it.

476
00:33:20,415 --> 00:33:23,126
No way. How can she put up with that?
I'm sure she has no idea.

477
00:33:23,209 --> 00:33:26,170
She does know. His mistress is only 23,

478
00:33:26,254 --> 00:33:27,964
and she refers to Su-min's mom
as his first wife.

479
00:33:28,464 --> 00:33:29,382
One more thing.

480
00:33:29,716 --> 00:33:31,884
I heard that Yun-jae's dad

481
00:33:32,176 --> 00:33:34,387
hits his wife once in a while.

482
00:33:36,264 --> 00:33:38,558
Hey, are you out of your mind?

483
00:33:38,641 --> 00:33:40,226
My gosh, what a jerk.

484
00:33:40,309 --> 00:33:43,938
That's obviously why she has fallen
for Dr. Jang who's gentle and warmhearted.

485
00:33:44,772 --> 00:33:48,109
Jae-seok is ignorant
and he talks nonsense often,

486
00:33:48,192 --> 00:33:50,278
but he's such a great husband.

487
00:33:50,695 --> 00:33:51,571
Don't you think so?

488
00:33:52,363 --> 00:33:53,614
So far, yes.

489
00:33:54,490 --> 00:33:55,700
So far?

490
00:33:57,285 --> 00:34:00,997
My mom told me to never trust men.

491
00:34:04,792 --> 00:34:06,085
-Sir.
-Yes.

492
00:34:06,419 --> 00:34:08,337
We should stop here for today.

493
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:09,839
Shall we?

494
00:34:10,214 --> 00:34:11,090
Yes.

495
00:34:11,174 --> 00:34:13,885
-All right then.
-Please don't push yourself too hard.

496
00:34:14,052 --> 00:34:14,927
Okay.

497
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:21,017
It must have caused stress on the joints.

498
00:34:34,155 --> 00:34:35,656
-Ms. Park.
-Yes.

499
00:34:36,491 --> 00:34:37,533
Bok-ja.

500
00:34:41,245 --> 00:34:42,163
Yes.

501
00:34:42,497 --> 00:34:44,040
Is there anything you want?

502
00:34:44,707 --> 00:34:46,125
What do you want to buy the most?

503
00:34:47,668 --> 00:34:49,212
It's okay. You can tell me.

504
00:34:49,295 --> 00:34:51,506
-I don't want anything.
-Why isn't there any?

505
00:34:53,424 --> 00:34:54,592
There is one thing, but...

506
00:34:55,259 --> 00:34:59,472
I've been wanting to buy a bag
that I can carry like this.

507
00:34:59,555 --> 00:35:01,265
You know that my hearing is bad.

508
00:35:01,516 --> 00:35:03,017
Say it louder.

509
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:05,269
Goodness, you startled me.

510
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:08,064
A bag. I want to buy a bag.

511
00:35:10,191 --> 00:35:12,485
Just a bag? Is that all you want?

512
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:15,071
My gosh. "Just a bag"?

513
00:35:15,154 --> 00:35:16,864
Call Mr. Kim.

514
00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:20,076
-Why?
-So that you can go buy a bag.

515
00:35:20,701 --> 00:35:21,911
Buy other things too.

516
00:35:21,994 --> 00:35:24,539
Get yourself some new clothes
and new shoes as well.

517
00:35:27,333 --> 00:35:28,543
Are you being serious now?

518
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:31,712
Gosh. It's okay, sir.

519
00:35:32,088 --> 00:35:33,047
Do as I say!

520
00:35:48,479 --> 00:35:50,898
Mr. Chairman told me to make sure
you get the most expensive ones.

521
00:36:07,915 --> 00:36:11,627
I'm sorry. I need to use the washroom.

522
00:36:11,752 --> 00:36:12,628
Sure.

523
00:37:43,594 --> 00:37:45,596
Ms. Park, this is...

524
00:37:47,765 --> 00:37:50,142
Do you think that I'll let
a piece of trash like you

525
00:37:50,351 --> 00:37:51,727
have your way?

526
00:37:57,024 --> 00:38:00,319
A lowborn woman like you
doesn't even deserve these things.

527
00:38:02,655 --> 00:38:04,490
Know your place, Bok-ja Park.

528
00:38:05,241 --> 00:38:06,867
You're just a maid here.

529
00:38:07,118 --> 00:38:09,662
My father-in-law's caregiver.
Do you understand?

530
00:39:18,314 --> 00:39:19,732
Ms. Kim, please call me.

531
00:39:44,131 --> 00:39:46,258
-Hello?
-I'm calling from Suite 702.

532
00:39:47,426 --> 00:39:48,636
Who are you?

533
00:39:48,886 --> 00:39:51,305
Let's meet up in Seoul.
I'll tell you in person.

534
00:39:51,389 --> 00:39:52,473
I asked you who you are.

535
00:39:52,807 --> 00:39:54,350
I work at the residence.

536
00:39:55,476 --> 00:39:57,728
Will you be okay to come to my area
tomorrow afternoon?

537
00:39:57,978 --> 00:40:00,231
I'll send you my address.

538
00:40:09,323 --> 00:40:10,574
Bring her back immediately!

539
00:40:10,866 --> 00:40:13,160
We'll find another caregiver
as soon as possible.

540
00:40:13,452 --> 00:40:14,703
What? Another caregiver?

541
00:40:15,246 --> 00:40:16,831
Ju-mi, you kicked her out, didn't you?

542
00:40:16,997 --> 00:40:20,459
Father, I'll get a hold of her
and make sure to bring her back.

543
00:40:20,543 --> 00:40:22,211
She's not picking up!

544
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:25,631
I'll make sure to bring her back, Father.

545
00:40:25,881 --> 00:40:28,634
Dad, trust A-jin and wait for a few days.

546
00:40:28,759 --> 00:40:29,927
And please make sure you eat.

547
00:40:30,302 --> 00:40:33,889
I've been able to enjoy the kind of life
that other people have after a long time.

548
00:40:34,598 --> 00:40:38,185
I've been laughing a lot
because she made me so happy.

549
00:40:38,894 --> 00:40:41,981
Ju-mi, what on earth did you say to her?

550
00:40:42,064 --> 00:40:43,858
I told her that she should know her place.

551
00:40:45,401 --> 00:40:49,155
When I saw her holding the designer bag
and shoes that you bought for her,

552
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:51,323
I got so upset.

553
00:40:52,533 --> 00:40:56,328
Even I don't own a high-end designer bag.
Why should a caregiver have one?

554
00:40:56,787 --> 00:40:59,373
She made you happy? That woman?

555
00:41:00,124 --> 00:41:02,835
That's why we hired her.
We pay her to do that.

556
00:41:02,918 --> 00:41:03,878
Get out!

557
00:41:05,796 --> 00:41:09,049
If we can't find her,

558
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:12,595
both you and Un-gyu
will be kicked out of this house.

559
00:41:13,929 --> 00:41:16,557
Ms. Jo, please call Mr. Kim.

560
00:41:33,491 --> 00:41:35,784
You saw that, right?
Do you still think that I'm wrong?

561
00:41:35,868 --> 00:41:37,203
I'll find her. We must meet with her.

562
00:41:37,286 --> 00:41:38,871
No, don't meet with her. Don't find her.

563
00:41:39,663 --> 00:41:40,623
Ju-mi.

564
00:41:41,373 --> 00:41:42,875
She'll probably answer your call.

565
00:41:42,958 --> 00:41:44,877
Meet up with her
and persuade her to come back.

566
00:41:45,669 --> 00:41:46,587
Okay.

567
00:41:47,421 --> 00:41:48,422
What a headache.

568
00:42:17,284 --> 00:42:19,995
BEAUTIFUL MS. WOO

569
00:42:35,636 --> 00:42:37,179
Are you away on a trip or something?

570
00:42:37,513 --> 00:42:40,641
You should have given us a heads-up.
Father is looking for you.

571
00:42:40,891 --> 00:42:42,768
He might call the police
to report you missing

572
00:42:42,851 --> 00:42:44,270
if we don't hear from you.

573
00:42:51,235 --> 00:42:52,152
It's me.

574
00:42:52,778 --> 00:42:55,447
Please don't bother
to file a missing-person report.

575
00:42:57,366 --> 00:42:58,367
Let's meet.

576
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:02,955
What?

577
00:43:03,289 --> 00:43:04,957
She spoke with no accent just now.

578
00:43:17,845 --> 00:43:19,847
-You...
-Hello, Ms. Kim.

579
00:43:19,930 --> 00:43:21,056
What's this ruse?

580
00:43:21,807 --> 00:43:22,933
Shall I teach you a lesson?

581
00:43:23,934 --> 00:43:25,477
I saw the man

582
00:43:25,811 --> 00:43:28,355
who stayed in Suite 508
walking out of your room.

583
00:43:30,608 --> 00:43:32,443
He is a close friend of mine.

584
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:34,737
We ran into each other,
so we had tea together.

585
00:43:35,821 --> 00:43:38,490
Don't you know that I invite my friends
to my room once in a while?

586
00:43:38,699 --> 00:43:40,659
We have parties there and play cards too.

587
00:43:40,743 --> 00:43:42,244
-I know.
-Then?

588
00:43:42,328 --> 00:43:44,413
I did some digging
on that man, Gi-seok Choi,

589
00:43:44,538 --> 00:43:46,123
and found out
that he stayed at our residence

590
00:43:46,206 --> 00:43:48,167
on all the days that you came.

591
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:52,671
-Have you been watching me all this time?
-Gosh, of course not.

592
00:43:53,005 --> 00:43:54,798
I've been working hard, that's all.

593
00:43:55,841 --> 00:43:58,802
I've never even seen that guy
drinking a bottle of water in his room.

594
00:43:58,886 --> 00:44:01,722
Isn't it bizarre? It didn't look
like he slept in the room at all.

595
00:44:02,097 --> 00:44:05,934
From the toothpaste and toothbrush
to the towels, nothing was used.

596
00:44:07,853 --> 00:44:09,104
What is it that you want?

597
00:44:11,190 --> 00:44:13,734
I'd just like 30 million won in cash.

598
00:44:16,487 --> 00:44:18,697
I won't be greedy
and ask you for more later on.

599
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:23,494
You just said that you won't ask for more.
Can I really trust you on that?

600
00:44:23,577 --> 00:44:24,411
Of course.

601
00:44:25,371 --> 00:44:28,123
Also, there is one more thing.

602
00:44:29,625 --> 00:44:31,752
Please get me promoted
to room division manager.

603
00:44:32,753 --> 00:44:36,423
I'm on a contract now.
Please make me a permanent employee.

604
00:44:36,757 --> 00:44:38,342
That's all I want.

605
00:44:42,888 --> 00:44:44,640
All right. Instead,

606
00:44:45,349 --> 00:44:47,601
you and I will take this secret
to the grave, okay?

607
00:44:47,726 --> 00:44:49,770
Your secret is safe with me. Then.

608
00:45:05,536 --> 00:45:07,287
Did Father buy you that coat?

609
00:45:10,374 --> 00:45:11,792
It looks amazing on you.

610
00:45:12,167 --> 00:45:14,086
It goes very well with the bag too.

611
00:45:17,131 --> 00:45:19,508
I knew it. You have such great taste.

612
00:45:20,342 --> 00:45:23,637
You shouldn't clean those shoes
with a regular leather cleaner.

613
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:25,139
You can't use water either.

614
00:45:25,222 --> 00:45:27,266
Calfskin is tricky to take care of.

615
00:45:27,808 --> 00:45:29,893
-Then...
-You can use a soft brush.

616
00:45:30,018 --> 00:45:33,355
You should clean it with a toothbrush
with soft, fine bristles.

617
00:45:33,522 --> 00:45:36,733
If they ever get a stain, mix detergent
and shampoo in a one-to-one ratio,

618
00:45:36,817 --> 00:45:39,486
then use a minute amount of the mixture
to remove the stain.

619
00:45:47,703 --> 00:45:48,954
Please open it.

620
00:45:52,791 --> 00:45:54,376
I made it.

621
00:45:56,086 --> 00:45:57,212
It's beautiful.

622
00:45:57,296 --> 00:46:01,300
It goes so well with your clothes,
shoes, and bag.

623
00:46:03,719 --> 00:46:05,179
You should come over to my place.

624
00:46:05,846 --> 00:46:09,266
I've made so many accessories like this.
I'll give you the ones you want.

625
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:11,226
-Really?
-Yes.

626
00:46:11,977 --> 00:46:14,938
I should have invited you over
for a meal a long time ago.

627
00:46:16,482 --> 00:46:17,357
Ms. Park.

628
00:46:18,192 --> 00:46:19,526
Please come back.

629
00:46:19,693 --> 00:46:21,278
Father cried.

630
00:46:22,654 --> 00:46:25,699
-Why did he cry?
-He must miss you a lot.

631
00:46:25,949 --> 00:46:27,576
So, let's go now.

632
00:46:34,041 --> 00:46:36,001
I'll drag you if you don't come with me.

633
00:46:45,719 --> 00:46:46,595
Gosh.

634
00:46:46,803 --> 00:46:48,972
I never asked you to give it to me.

635
00:46:49,056 --> 00:46:50,724
Ms. Woo, why are you being like this?

636
00:46:50,807 --> 00:46:53,810
It looks better on you. Keep it.

637
00:46:54,144 --> 00:46:55,270
It's so pretty on you.

638
00:46:56,313 --> 00:46:59,316
By the way, you can sound
like a Seoul native.

639
00:46:59,399 --> 00:47:02,361
I know, right?
I can talk without the accent.

640
00:47:21,463 --> 00:47:22,714
Sir.

641
00:47:34,434 --> 00:47:37,771
-You're back.
-"After all, tomorrow is another day."

642
00:47:38,146 --> 00:47:40,148
That's what Scarlett O'Hara said.

643
00:47:44,111 --> 00:47:45,612
I don't even know anymore.

644
00:48:14,850 --> 00:48:16,435
-Namaste.
-Namaste.

645
00:48:28,196 --> 00:48:29,656
She comes to our clinic.

646
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:31,283
She wants to get fillers done
on her eyelids.

647
00:48:32,075 --> 00:48:35,746
Mistresses must work harder
to take care of their looks

648
00:48:35,829 --> 00:48:36,997
because it's their weapon.

649
00:48:37,873 --> 00:48:41,043
Why do women try so hard to impress men?
It annoys me so much.

650
00:48:41,627 --> 00:48:45,589
Men stink of cigarettes,
get big bellies, and go bald.

651
00:48:46,423 --> 00:48:50,052
-Is something going on with you?
-Life is a series of problems.

652
00:48:50,594 --> 00:48:53,347
Also, are you really going to keep Ji-hu
at that math institute?

653
00:48:53,930 --> 00:48:55,265
I already told you that I will.

654
00:48:55,349 --> 00:48:58,894
Don't be so stubborn and join us.
Ms. Baek brought it upon herself.

655
00:48:58,977 --> 00:49:01,813
Because of those two kids, 14 students
in the advanced class have quit.

656
00:49:01,897 --> 00:49:04,983
She's not running an education business.
She needs to rethink her approach

657
00:49:05,275 --> 00:49:07,235
because she's in the service industry
after all.

658
00:49:07,319 --> 00:49:10,238
I really can't understand the moms
who are getting their kids to quit

659
00:49:10,322 --> 00:49:11,698
because of such reasons.

660
00:49:12,199 --> 00:49:13,742
Sometimes, you have to memorize things

661
00:49:13,825 --> 00:49:16,203
that you don't understand
in order to go with the tide.

662
00:49:16,411 --> 00:49:17,996
Just memorize it
if you can't understand it.

663
00:49:18,622 --> 00:49:20,540
I don't think I can do that
because I'm not smart.

664
00:49:21,124 --> 00:49:22,668
You're really stubborn.

665
00:49:24,211 --> 00:49:25,712
You'll come to the brunch tomorrow, right?

666
00:49:25,837 --> 00:49:27,589
Of course. I already paid
the membership fees.

667
00:49:27,964 --> 00:49:29,383
I knew you'd say that.

668
00:49:32,636 --> 00:49:34,721
Slowly.

669
00:49:36,139 --> 00:49:38,016
-Good.
-Gosh, that feels nice.

670
00:49:39,434 --> 00:49:41,645
Shall we have noodle soup for lunch?

671
00:49:42,437 --> 00:49:43,647
Is that what you'd like to eat?

672
00:49:44,648 --> 00:49:48,151
Sure, I'll make it quick.

673
00:49:49,152 --> 00:49:50,237
Where did you sleep?

674
00:49:51,321 --> 00:49:52,280
At a motel.

675
00:49:52,572 --> 00:49:55,200
Don't you have anywhere to stay
besides my place?

676
00:49:56,076 --> 00:49:59,246
I was renting an apartment,
but I needed the deposit to pay my debt.

677
00:49:59,371 --> 00:50:00,580
How much debt do you have?

678
00:50:00,872 --> 00:50:04,668
I moved in here because Ms. Woo said
that she would raise my pay.

679
00:50:04,751 --> 00:50:06,878
I'll be able to pay it off
after working for a full year.

680
00:50:06,962 --> 00:50:08,213
I'll pay it off for you.

681
00:50:09,381 --> 00:50:10,966
It's okay, sir.

682
00:50:11,049 --> 00:50:12,217
No.

683
00:50:13,343 --> 00:50:15,053
I've lived my life wrong.

684
00:50:15,512 --> 00:50:18,390
None of my children turned out
the way I wanted them to,

685
00:50:19,057 --> 00:50:22,310
and my wife died young due to an illness.

686
00:50:23,103 --> 00:50:26,440
It's not like I'm going to take
all the money with me when I die.

687
00:50:26,857 --> 00:50:28,066
I'll clear your debt for you.

688
00:50:28,692 --> 00:50:29,776
How much do you owe in total?

689
00:50:40,245 --> 00:50:42,748
So, are you saying that Ms. Park
told you to clean my place

690
00:50:42,831 --> 00:50:44,791
twice a week?

691
00:50:44,958 --> 00:50:48,295
Yes, ma'am. She also told me to only clean
Mr. Chairman's house four times a week.

692
00:50:49,004 --> 00:50:50,964
Why didn't she discuss it with me first?

693
00:50:51,047 --> 00:50:55,802
I thought that your housekeeper
was coming back after her maternity leave.

694
00:50:57,137 --> 00:50:59,973
Let's follow that schedule for now.
Twice here and four times a week there.

695
00:51:04,311 --> 00:51:06,813
Gosh, your place is so nice.

696
00:51:06,897 --> 00:51:09,065
It's beautifully decorated.

697
00:51:09,149 --> 00:51:10,859
-Ms. Park.
-Yes.

698
00:51:11,276 --> 00:51:14,613
Please make sure you discuss
everything with me or Ju-mi first.

699
00:51:15,655 --> 00:51:16,698
What do you mean...

700
00:51:16,782 --> 00:51:20,410
It's about Ms. Jo. I heard you told her
to clean my place twice a week.

701
00:51:22,204 --> 00:51:23,455
About that.

702
00:51:23,830 --> 00:51:26,666
It didn't look like you had a housekeeper.

703
00:51:26,833 --> 00:51:29,336
I thought it'd be too much work
for you to clean your place alone,

704
00:51:29,544 --> 00:51:32,005
so I just wanted to help.

705
00:51:33,131 --> 00:51:34,549
Did it upset you?

706
00:51:34,633 --> 00:51:36,218
I appreciate you want to help,

707
00:51:36,551 --> 00:51:39,054
but there are two daughters-in-law
in the family.

708
00:51:39,429 --> 00:51:40,514
I know that, of course.

709
00:51:40,597 --> 00:51:43,850
Ju-mi is in an awkward position now
because her husband has fallen

710
00:51:43,934 --> 00:51:47,604
out of favor with his father,
but she still is the lady of the house.

711
00:51:48,188 --> 00:51:50,232
Please respect her opinions.

712
00:51:50,315 --> 00:51:53,360
Let me correct that.
Please do as Ju-mi says.

713
00:51:54,903 --> 00:51:58,907
I'd like you to get her permission
before making any decisions from now on.

714
00:52:03,995 --> 00:52:05,163
Okay, I will.

715
00:52:07,541 --> 00:52:08,750
I got the message.

716
00:52:10,836 --> 00:52:11,878
You should get some rest now.

717
00:52:13,004 --> 00:52:13,922
Wait.

718
00:52:14,422 --> 00:52:16,132
From now on, Ju-mi will pay you as well.

719
00:52:16,216 --> 00:52:18,385
I'll speak to her about it.

720
00:52:40,657 --> 00:52:41,575
Well...

721
00:52:42,784 --> 00:52:44,703
There's a temporary front desk clerk

722
00:52:44,786 --> 00:52:46,621
named Eun-seok Kim
at the Songdo residence.

723
00:52:46,705 --> 00:52:47,539
Who is that?

724
00:52:49,124 --> 00:52:51,877
I've been observing him for a while,

725
00:52:52,502 --> 00:52:54,629
and he's really good at what he does.

726
00:52:55,088 --> 00:52:56,923
Can you give him a permanent position?

727
00:52:57,465 --> 00:52:58,717
Why do you even care?

728
00:52:58,967 --> 00:53:00,886
You need to groom talent

729
00:53:00,969 --> 00:53:03,263
in order to make it big
in the hotel industry.

730
00:53:03,513 --> 00:53:06,433
Let's be honest. All of your employees
are temporary workers,

731
00:53:06,516 --> 00:53:07,809
and it's not even a five-star hotel.

732
00:53:07,893 --> 00:53:09,936
They have no pride
because it's just a residence,

733
00:53:10,061 --> 00:53:11,855
so they can quit anytime.

734
00:53:12,731 --> 00:53:15,609
I think that he is really good at his job.

735
00:53:15,734 --> 00:53:18,320
-What is his name again?
-Eun-seok Kim.

736
00:53:26,161 --> 00:53:27,245
You bitch!

737
00:53:29,122 --> 00:53:31,041
I've been waiting for you. Come on in.

738
00:53:31,750 --> 00:53:32,584
Have a seat.

739
00:53:33,376 --> 00:53:34,961
-He's the psychic.
-I see.

740
00:53:36,922 --> 00:53:39,758
-And among your family members...
-My gosh!

741
00:53:40,050 --> 00:53:41,885
Your mom is your favorite.

742
00:53:42,177 --> 00:53:45,597
Jeez, he is so accurate.
He is really good.

743
00:53:50,477 --> 00:53:51,436
Your wife...

744
00:53:51,937 --> 00:53:54,856
I mean, Ji-hu's mom. You must have
married her because you love her a lot.

745
00:53:55,190 --> 00:53:56,066
Of course.

746
00:53:56,316 --> 00:53:57,651
She used to be drop-dead gorgeous.

747
00:53:58,151 --> 00:53:59,569
She is still gorgeous.

748
00:53:59,861 --> 00:54:02,989
She is not as hot as she used to be.

749
00:54:07,953 --> 00:54:11,289
We shouldn't have had tteok-bokki
together that day.

750
00:54:12,165 --> 00:54:16,169
I shouldn't have invited you in that day.

751
00:54:17,504 --> 00:54:18,380
This is so...

752
00:54:20,256 --> 00:54:21,591
This is killing me.

753
00:54:22,342 --> 00:54:23,510
What's killing you?

754
00:54:23,593 --> 00:54:27,263
The fact that I've fallen
for a married man.

755
00:54:27,347 --> 00:54:29,724
Well, that's not even a big deal nowadays.

756
00:54:29,933 --> 00:54:33,103
Who cares about such a thing?
You sound so old-fashioned.

757
00:54:34,312 --> 00:54:35,230
No.

758
00:54:35,730 --> 00:54:37,190
Let's stop here.

759
00:54:37,399 --> 00:54:40,860
We haven't even done anything.
What's there to stop?

760
00:54:40,944 --> 00:54:44,239
I don't want to have to feel guilty
or be secretive about the person I love.

761
00:54:45,949 --> 00:54:47,409
I'm just not cut out for it.

762
00:54:47,492 --> 00:54:48,743
But I'm okay with it.

763
00:54:51,371 --> 00:54:54,833
I'll make sure she never finds out.

764
00:54:55,417 --> 00:54:59,087
A-jin is actually more simple-minded
than you think. I bet she has no idea.

765
00:54:59,462 --> 00:55:03,675
I'll make sure that she never finds out,
so just trust me. Okay?

766
00:55:07,554 --> 00:55:08,763
The sirloin is very good.

767
00:55:08,972 --> 00:55:11,349
This is on me,
so you should have another one.

768
00:55:25,530 --> 00:55:27,866
Ms. Woo wants me to get paid
directly from you

769
00:55:28,742 --> 00:55:32,162
and get your permission on everything

770
00:55:32,579 --> 00:55:34,664
-from now on.
-I heard.

771
00:55:35,999 --> 00:55:36,916
I see.

772
00:55:38,543 --> 00:55:39,502
First off,

773
00:55:40,086 --> 00:55:42,338
I want you to move out of this house.

774
00:55:42,839 --> 00:55:45,425
You'll come here in the morning
and leave when your day is done.

775
00:55:46,384 --> 00:55:48,219
-Why?
-It's because we never planned

776
00:55:48,303 --> 00:55:51,389
to hire a live-in caregiver
if you must ask.

777
00:55:55,185 --> 00:55:56,269
Okay.

778
00:55:58,146 --> 00:55:59,439
I'll move out.

779
00:56:00,190 --> 00:56:03,234
Is there anything else you'd like to say?

780
00:56:04,402 --> 00:56:05,737
That's all for today.

781
00:56:06,696 --> 00:56:09,407
Then, when should I move my stuff
out of the house?

782
00:56:09,574 --> 00:56:10,784
As soon as possible.

783
00:56:11,701 --> 00:56:12,744
Okay.

784
00:56:14,162 --> 00:56:17,332
I'll be living with Mr. Chairman,

785
00:56:17,916 --> 00:56:19,459
so I guess the place should be pretty big.

786
00:56:19,959 --> 00:56:24,297
He wouldn't want to live in a small place
since he's used to this mansion.

787
00:56:24,672 --> 00:56:25,715
What do you mean by that?

788
00:56:26,466 --> 00:56:28,927
Did you want me to move out by myself?

789
00:56:34,140 --> 00:56:36,559
If I do, your father-in-law
will probably faint from emotional shock.

790
00:56:37,352 --> 00:56:38,853
Is that your goal?

791
00:56:39,562 --> 00:56:43,274
Are you doing this so that your husband
can inherit his money as soon as possible?

792
00:56:44,317 --> 00:56:46,736
Is that what you want, ma'am?

793
00:56:51,741 --> 00:56:55,286
Don't provoke me, please.

794
00:56:56,538 --> 00:56:57,747
If you don't behave yourself,

795
00:57:00,583 --> 00:57:01,960
you'll get kicked out.

796
00:57:25,692 --> 00:57:27,193
Please take me home.

797
00:57:28,194 --> 00:57:29,112
Well...

798
00:57:31,114 --> 00:57:32,198
Let's kiss.

799
00:57:32,949 --> 00:57:34,284
Sorry? My gosh.

800
00:57:34,409 --> 00:57:36,786
I've been wondering what I can do
to express my feelings for you

801
00:57:37,203 --> 00:57:39,914
and have come to this decision
after thinking for two and a half hours.

802
00:57:40,790 --> 00:57:41,833
Let's kiss.

803
00:57:44,127 --> 00:57:47,464
It will help us decide which direction
our relationship should take.

804
00:58:21,122 --> 00:58:22,457
Gosh. Are you okay?

805
00:58:43,811 --> 00:58:46,022
-Have you had dinner yet?
-Yes.

806
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:51,277
You must be working hard these days.
You have lost weight.

807
00:58:52,153 --> 00:58:53,071
I know, right?

808
00:58:53,571 --> 00:58:56,533
Make me some stamina-boosting foods
with things like eels or deer antlers.

809
00:58:56,616 --> 00:58:58,576
They aren't compatible
with your constitution.

810
00:58:58,660 --> 00:59:00,703
I'll get the anti-fatigue
herbal pills made.

811
00:59:01,496 --> 00:59:03,456
Gosh. I'm so proud of you, Jae-seok.

812
00:59:07,335 --> 00:59:09,671
Let's take a family trip.
It's been too long.

813
00:59:09,879 --> 00:59:12,423
-What's with a family trip?
-We haven't taken one in a long time.

814
00:59:12,507 --> 00:59:14,092
We see each other every day.

815
00:59:14,175 --> 00:59:16,010
Then, why do you eat every day?

816
00:59:17,303 --> 00:59:18,221
A-jin.

817
00:59:18,471 --> 00:59:19,305
What?

818
00:59:21,140 --> 00:59:21,975
Never mind.

819
00:59:22,600 --> 00:59:23,560
I'm going to bed.

820
00:59:29,857 --> 00:59:30,900
What was that about?

821
01:00:00,054 --> 01:00:00,972
The groom is entering now.

822
01:00:30,084 --> 01:00:32,128
Dad!

823
01:00:34,756 --> 01:00:36,299
Dad!

824
01:00:38,051 --> 01:00:40,261
How can you get re-married?

825
01:00:40,345 --> 01:00:43,431
I want to do it too.
I want to get married twice like you.

826
01:00:43,556 --> 01:00:46,517
Why can't I do it? Let go of me!

827
01:00:46,601 --> 01:00:49,145
Dad, I want to become like you.

828
01:00:50,438 --> 01:00:52,440
I'll get married twice too.

829
01:00:53,483 --> 01:00:54,609
Dad!

830
01:02:16,399 --> 01:02:20,361
JU-MI

831
01:02:23,781 --> 01:02:24,699
Hello?

832
01:02:25,450 --> 01:02:26,367
A-jin.

833
01:02:28,202 --> 01:02:29,620
Can you come over for a few minutes?

834
01:03:09,702 --> 01:03:11,621
What you did is simply wrong.

835
01:03:11,704 --> 01:03:15,666
It was a mistake.
Please give me a chance, Ms. Woo.

836
01:03:15,750 --> 01:03:17,418
She's one sneaky, scary woman.

837
01:03:17,502 --> 01:03:19,587
I bet she moved in here
with an ulterior motive.

838
01:03:19,962 --> 01:03:22,507
I told you to never come into my room.

839
01:03:22,590 --> 01:03:24,383
Do you think that things will change

840
01:03:24,467 --> 01:03:26,052
just because you and Father
slept together?

841
01:03:26,135 --> 01:03:27,220
How much is your debt?

842
01:03:27,470 --> 01:03:29,847
Call them immediately
and pay it off right away.

843
01:03:34,143 --> 01:03:37,271
She was very young and pretty.
What if he's having an affair with her?

844
01:03:37,522 --> 01:03:39,023
Good luck. I hope all goes well.

845
01:03:39,106 --> 01:03:39,941
Thanks.

846
01:03:42,443 --> 01:03:43,986
I'll devote myself to you

847
01:03:44,320 --> 01:03:47,365
and work harder to take great care of you.

848
01:03:47,532 --> 01:03:48,950
She seemed like a good person.

849
01:03:49,033 --> 01:03:51,786
She was convicted of fraud
and embezzlement seven years ago.

850
01:03:52,411 --> 01:03:53,871
I want you gone first thing tomorrow.

851
01:03:53,955 --> 01:03:57,792
You'd better watch out from now on.
You might end up behind bars

852
01:03:58,042 --> 01:04:02,129
before I get kicked out of this house.

853
01:04:02,213 --> 01:04:04,173
