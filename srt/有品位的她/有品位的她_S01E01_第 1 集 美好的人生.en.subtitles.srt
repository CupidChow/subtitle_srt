1
00:00:53,553 --> 00:00:55,847
The killer didn't leave footprints
anywhere in the house.

2
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:58,683
We didn't find the killer's fingerprints
or saliva on the scene either.

3
00:00:59,517 --> 00:01:01,728
All we found
was her family's fingerprints.

4
00:01:02,771 --> 00:01:03,813
Most importantly,

5
00:01:04,522 --> 00:01:08,109
those with the clearest motive
for murdering her

6
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:09,819
are her family members.

7
00:01:16,242 --> 00:01:18,369
Everyone in the family
except for Ms. A-jin Woo

8
00:01:18,703 --> 00:01:20,580
will be questioned as witnesses
starting today,

9
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:23,208
so your cooperation is required.

10
00:01:24,709 --> 00:01:25,794
GANGNAM POLICE STATION

11
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:29,255
The time of death is presumed
to be around 2 a.m. on February 28th.

12
00:01:29,631 --> 00:01:33,760
The first call to the police
was made at 9:17 a.m. that day.

13
00:01:33,885 --> 00:01:36,012
Now, I'll go over
who's on our list of suspects.

14
00:01:36,513 --> 00:01:37,472
Tae-dong Ahn.

15
00:01:37,597 --> 00:01:41,434
Ji-yeong Park's husband who certainly
has enough motive to kill her.

16
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:44,729
Jae-gu Ahn.

17
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:46,856
Tae-dong Ahn's eldest child

18
00:01:47,065 --> 00:01:48,983
who was even charged
with attempted murder in the past.

19
00:01:49,067 --> 00:01:51,611
He's definitely one of our prime suspects.

20
00:01:52,362 --> 00:01:53,363
Jae-hui Ahn.

21
00:01:53,655 --> 00:01:55,156
She's Tae-dong Ahn's second child.

22
00:01:55,323 --> 00:01:56,449
Even though she was

23
00:01:56,616 --> 00:01:58,827
in the same space with the victim
on the day of the incident,

24
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:01,329
but she lied in her statement
by saying that she wasn't with her.

25
00:02:02,163 --> 00:02:04,833
Ju-mi Park. She's married
to Tae-dong Ahn's eldest son.

26
00:02:05,166 --> 00:02:08,670
She has no alibi for the day
of the murder, and the statements

27
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:11,923
we received from people around the victim
make her one of our prime suspects.

28
00:02:32,235 --> 00:02:33,319
She died from TBI.

29
00:02:33,695 --> 00:02:36,781
There's nothing that shows she was raped.
There are no signs of resistance either.

30
00:02:38,324 --> 00:02:40,410
The killer hit her here twice
with a blunt weapon.

31
00:02:40,743 --> 00:02:42,245
The artery ruptured right away.

32
00:02:43,663 --> 00:02:45,373
We don't even have any space
to store the body.

33
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:46,791
Please get her transferred soon.

34
00:02:50,086 --> 00:02:51,254
Okay.

35
00:02:56,968 --> 00:02:58,136
Who do you think did it?

36
00:02:59,721 --> 00:03:01,180
I thought it was her, but I was wrong.

37
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:03,433
She's the only one with a firm alibi.

38
00:03:06,477 --> 00:03:08,771
So, Bok-ja Park.

39
00:03:09,564 --> 00:03:11,900
I mean, Ms. Ji-yeong Park.
You said you met her for the first time

40
00:03:12,275 --> 00:03:14,193
when you interviewed her
for the caregiver position,

41
00:03:14,277 --> 00:03:18,156
but we did some digging and found out
that the two of you go way back.

42
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:22,994
Do you really not remember?

43
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:33,338
Can I be born again?

44
00:03:34,672 --> 00:03:36,174
If I can,

45
00:03:37,926 --> 00:03:39,344
I don't want to live as Bok-ja Park.

46
00:03:40,345 --> 00:03:43,932
I want to live as the woman
who watched the moment

47
00:03:45,099 --> 00:03:46,434
I became a handful of ashes

48
00:03:47,477 --> 00:03:50,521
even if it's just once.

49
00:04:03,534 --> 00:04:05,328
We all want to be happy

50
00:04:06,162 --> 00:04:08,414
and covet the things that we don't have.

51
00:04:09,582 --> 00:04:12,585
From the intense pressure and belief
that it's the only way to happiness,

52
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:14,504
our lives begin.

53
00:04:16,214 --> 00:04:20,134
But we can't control anything in life

54
00:04:20,218 --> 00:04:22,720
from how it begins to how it ends.

55
00:04:24,597 --> 00:04:28,184
This is a story about me
and the woman who dreamed

56
00:04:29,477 --> 00:04:30,770
of becoming like me.

57
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:37,819
Residents of Gangnam-gu pay 15 percent
of the taxes that the city collects,

58
00:04:37,902 --> 00:04:40,780
but receive no benefit.
I understand why people are saying that.

59
00:04:40,905 --> 00:04:44,117
That amounts to a trillion
and 700 billion won.

60
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,994
It rightfully belongs to Gangnam.

61
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:50,039
Plus, the residents will have to put up
with all the noise from the redevelopment.

62
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:53,668
It's all because people are insecure.
They want Gangnam out of Seoul.

63
00:04:53,751 --> 00:04:55,169
I'd actually appreciate that.

64
00:04:55,253 --> 00:04:57,213
Then, Gangnam can become
a self-governing district.

65
00:04:58,047 --> 00:04:58,965
Hello.

66
00:05:03,845 --> 00:05:04,929
Hi!

67
00:05:05,513 --> 00:05:06,848
Hello, ladies.

68
00:05:07,223 --> 00:05:09,976
-Am I late?
-We'll cut you some slack.

69
00:05:10,268 --> 00:05:12,729
A-jin, is that clutch a limited edition?

70
00:05:13,271 --> 00:05:15,231
-No.
-I think I've seen it.

71
00:05:15,523 --> 00:05:16,983
-No, it's not.
-Right.

72
00:05:17,275 --> 00:05:19,402
Have you checked out
the new high-end shop in Bupyeong?

73
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:21,696
That shop. You know Gyeong-hun Park
in Class Four, right?

74
00:05:21,779 --> 00:05:24,782
Isn't his mom the one who gave me
the lash extension lady's number?

75
00:05:24,866 --> 00:05:25,867
That's right.

76
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:29,120
The class president's mom
got her eyebrows tattooed through his mom,

77
00:05:29,203 --> 00:05:30,246
and they look so natural.

78
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:32,749
Her husband owns that outlet.

79
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:35,668
He must have a coinvestor, right?
I mean, they don't seem that well-off.

80
00:05:36,502 --> 00:05:37,962
Do you know her number?

81
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:41,591
-Why do you need her number?
-I want the eyebrow tattoo place's number.

82
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:45,303
-Do you want to get it done?
-Not me. It's for my husband.

83
00:05:46,262 --> 00:05:48,181
The tarot reader in Apgujeong told me.

84
00:05:51,559 --> 00:05:52,477
You're in trouble.

85
00:05:53,394 --> 00:05:54,687
Your husband will cheat on you.

86
00:05:55,438 --> 00:05:57,482
-Pardon?
-Your husband is weak-willed,

87
00:05:57,565 --> 00:05:59,484
and he even has two earth
in his natal chart.

88
00:05:59,984 --> 00:06:02,945
It represents his spouse, which means
he's destined to have two wives.

89
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:05,740
That's crazy. So?

90
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:08,826
You're not about to tell me to slip
a talisman in his underwear, are you?

91
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:10,203
I'm not a shaman.

92
00:06:10,411 --> 00:06:12,497
I guess you don't know.
Even shamans come to me for readings

93
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:15,333
to find out when their abilities
will start wearing out.

94
00:06:17,376 --> 00:06:18,920
So, what should I do then?

95
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:23,966
You need to change his physiognomy.

96
00:06:24,634 --> 00:06:26,135
Through plastic surgery?

97
00:06:26,844 --> 00:06:28,221
That'd be the best,

98
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:30,848
but it looks like he's handsome.

99
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:32,809
He doesn't need any work done.

100
00:06:33,101 --> 00:06:34,685
Do the cards even tell you
about his looks?

101
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:38,106
Of course. He's rich and handsome.

102
00:06:41,484 --> 00:06:43,528
Plus, you have him wrapped
around your finger.

103
00:06:43,694 --> 00:06:45,905
Then, why would he fall for another woman?

104
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:47,865
That's just his fate, okay?

105
00:06:48,282 --> 00:06:49,534
So, what should I do?

106
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:54,622
Try making his eyebrows look thicker.

107
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:57,333
His brows are quite wimpy and sparse,
aren't they?

108
00:06:59,752 --> 00:07:01,879
Don't they look like foxtails?

109
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:05,383
Thicken them.
Make them look like caterpillars.

110
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,886
That will block another woman's energy
flowing in.

111
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:11,973
Caterpillars, okay?

112
00:07:12,473 --> 00:07:13,516
That's absurd.

113
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:17,228
But you can't just ignore it
when you hear something like that.

114
00:07:18,062 --> 00:07:18,896
Goodness.

115
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:21,149
If thickening your husband's eyebrows
can prevent his affairs,

116
00:07:21,232 --> 00:07:23,943
every husband in this country
should have heavy caterpillar brows.

117
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:28,239
Gi-ok, do you think
that your husband will never cheat on you?

118
00:07:29,615 --> 00:07:31,993
Well, I probably wouldn't care
if I never find out about it.

119
00:07:32,577 --> 00:07:35,163
Ms. Baek, you said you'll change
the kids' math study guide, right?

120
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:38,458
A new in-depth study guide
for the math competition just came out.

121
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:40,418
The questions will likely be based on it.

122
00:07:40,668 --> 00:07:41,878
I'll get all the kids on it.

123
00:07:42,086 --> 00:07:44,922
Math is definitely the determining factor
for which university kids can enter.

124
00:07:45,006 --> 00:07:47,717
Those who give up on math
basically have to give up on life.

125
00:07:47,925 --> 00:07:49,010
But Ms. Baek,

126
00:07:49,427 --> 00:07:52,722
you should make kids take a test
and only accept those who pass it.

127
00:07:53,514 --> 00:07:55,641
If you continue to accept
academically incompetent kids,

128
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:58,060
moms in prestigious families
won't send their kids to you.

129
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:02,857
I'm running a math institute
because I have to earn a living,

130
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:05,610
but I don't want to discriminate
against a certain group of kids.

131
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:09,197
The smart ones will excel
even without my lessons.

132
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:11,324
Those who are struggling in school
need my help.

133
00:08:12,283 --> 00:08:13,784
That is so true.

134
00:08:13,868 --> 00:08:16,078
You're a true educator.

135
00:08:18,706 --> 00:08:19,832
JIN-HEE

136
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:21,876
-I have to take this.
-Okay.

137
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:23,836
A-jin?

138
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:27,298
I told Ms. Bok-ja Park, to come at 3 p.m.

139
00:08:27,548 --> 00:08:30,968
She's so different from other candidates.

140
00:08:31,552 --> 00:08:33,971
She can use smartphone apps
without any difficulties.

141
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:37,391
She said she just needs the address
as she can use the navigation app.

142
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:40,311
Also, her voice sounded honest and kind.

143
00:08:41,437 --> 00:08:42,355
Yes.

144
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:47,193
I'm at the store now
to change strings on Ji-hu's violin.

145
00:08:47,777 --> 00:08:50,988
I'll go to the gallery after this
and pick up the painting.

146
00:08:56,702 --> 00:08:58,955
Even this teacup is so pretty.

147
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01,958
It's pretty, isn't it?
We must have similar taste.

148
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:03,584
I like this teacup too.

149
00:09:05,127 --> 00:09:07,880
It looks like one
of Henri Matisse's paintings.

150
00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:10,299
It is his painting.

151
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:11,842
I knew it.

152
00:09:13,761 --> 00:09:14,845
Do you like art?

153
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:17,181
I just enjoy looking at paintings.

154
00:09:17,598 --> 00:09:19,267
Life is tough.

155
00:09:20,184 --> 00:09:23,521
Looking at paintings
gives me peace of mind.

156
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:27,191
Maybe we were meant to meet.
I'm a big fan of Matisse's works too.

157
00:09:27,525 --> 00:09:28,526
Is that right?

158
00:09:28,943 --> 00:09:31,153
I do like his paintings,

159
00:09:31,612 --> 00:09:34,156
but I actually like Manet more.

160
00:09:35,116 --> 00:09:37,827
This is amazing.
We should go to a gallery together.

161
00:09:38,869 --> 00:09:40,788
I'd be honored.

162
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:43,874
Gosh. Did you go to art school?

163
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:45,376
I studied fashion design.

164
00:09:46,961 --> 00:09:48,254
I see.

165
00:09:51,048 --> 00:09:53,342
Well, Ms. Woo.

166
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:54,385
Yes.

167
00:09:54,802 --> 00:09:58,264
I'll take great care of him.

168
00:09:58,514 --> 00:10:01,475
I've worked as a caregiver
for a number of patients.

169
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:03,894
When people are physically ill,

170
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:06,689
they actually suffer more emotionally.

171
00:10:06,897 --> 00:10:10,651
Even those who were openhearted
become apathetic and unkind.

172
00:10:11,527 --> 00:10:14,822
Doctors will use medicine
to cure him physically,

173
00:10:15,239 --> 00:10:17,366
so I'd like to help him heal his heart

174
00:10:17,491 --> 00:10:20,494
by doing my very best.

175
00:10:21,704 --> 00:10:23,205
Please give me a chance.

176
00:10:23,748 --> 00:10:26,125
I'll do my utmost
to take great care of him.

177
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:30,463
Please help him
so that he can become happier

178
00:10:30,838 --> 00:10:32,048
and healthier.

179
00:10:32,173 --> 00:10:34,300
I'll give you a raise
if his condition improves.

180
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:35,468
Please help us out.

181
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:39,013
Then, does that mean I'm hired?

182
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:41,724
Yes, you can start tomorrow.

183
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:45,770
What are my hours going to be like?

184
00:10:46,187 --> 00:10:50,066
Father usually goes to bed at 10 p.m.
and wakes up at 7 a.m.,

185
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:51,859
-so I guess...
-How about

186
00:10:52,401 --> 00:10:54,820
you hire me as a live-in caregiver?

187
00:10:57,573 --> 00:11:01,035
I mean, I'm sure he has to drink water
in the middle of the night.

188
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:03,371
He'll want to go to the bathroom as well.

189
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:07,792
Will that be okay with you?

190
00:11:08,626 --> 00:11:12,129
We'd really appreciate it.

191
00:11:12,254 --> 00:11:14,924
Goodness. What can I do?

192
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:18,844
Caregiving isn't a nine-to-five job.

193
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:24,016
May I take a look at your china?

194
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,393
Of course, have a look.

195
00:11:26,852 --> 00:11:29,271
Did you pick this out too?

196
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:30,314
Yes, I did.

197
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:34,068
Do you like Piet Mondrian?

198
00:11:34,402 --> 00:11:36,821
Yes. Do you like his three primary colors?

199
00:11:37,238 --> 00:11:39,824
I actually have a deeper appreciation

200
00:11:40,157 --> 00:11:43,035
for Wassily Kandinsky's style of work.

201
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:55,381
I'll bring my stuff tomorrow
and start working right away then.

202
00:11:55,506 --> 00:11:58,384
Sure. Just bring what you'll need
for about a week.

203
00:11:58,467 --> 00:12:00,594
We'll send a car to your place
to move heavy things.

204
00:12:00,803 --> 00:12:04,348
Just focus on looking after Father.
We'll take care of the rest.

205
00:12:05,015 --> 00:12:06,392
Thank you very much.

206
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:09,186
Then, I'll get going.

207
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:10,938
Okay, goodbye.

208
00:12:13,774 --> 00:12:15,192
Well, Ms. Woo.

209
00:12:16,193 --> 00:12:17,111
Yes.

210
00:12:18,362 --> 00:12:22,032
You're really beautiful.

211
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:25,453
Thank you.

212
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:27,621
I'll see you tomorrow.

213
00:12:53,063 --> 00:12:56,400
Our destiny is predetermined at birth,

214
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:01,238
and it's too cruel to some of us.

215
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:03,657
Our social class is decided for us,

216
00:13:04,074 --> 00:13:06,577
and moving up in the hierarchy
is not allowed in most cases.

217
00:13:07,745 --> 00:13:09,163
About the artist, Gi-yeong Jeon,

218
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:12,583
you recognized his talent
before anyone else did five years ago.

219
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:15,878
Everyone else thought that Sun-ji Choi
would be the next big star,

220
00:13:16,128 --> 00:13:20,090
but you supported Gi-yeong Jeon's works,

221
00:13:20,174 --> 00:13:23,093
saying that he'll become
the greatest contemporary artist.

222
00:13:23,427 --> 00:13:26,263
Now, he can practically charge
however much he wants for his works.

223
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:28,182
You have such a good eye.

224
00:13:28,265 --> 00:13:29,975
What's this artist like?

225
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:31,644
In what aspect?

226
00:13:32,102 --> 00:13:35,689
In the association alone,
there are over 50 artists who mimic

227
00:13:35,773 --> 00:13:38,275
Andy Warhol or Roy Lichtenstein's works.

228
00:13:38,526 --> 00:13:40,027
Will she keep her own distinct style?

229
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:41,320
I can guarantee that.

230
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:43,489
Her unique perspective
and strong self-esteem

231
00:13:43,572 --> 00:13:46,784
already supersede that
of Julian Opie and Damien Hirst.

232
00:13:47,535 --> 00:13:50,538
Isn't that why you chose her?

233
00:13:59,296 --> 00:14:02,258
Gosh, that hurts. The needle
pricked my skin. It hurts so much.

234
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,343
Why on earth do I have to get this done?

235
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:06,971
It'll make you become successful.
It'll help you lock in cash flow.

236
00:14:07,054 --> 00:14:09,098
Jeez, do you actually think
that makes sense?

237
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:10,307
Yes, I do.

238
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:17,815
You and your friends
believe in superstitions too much.

239
00:14:17,898 --> 00:14:19,692
Please be gentle.

240
00:14:30,995 --> 00:14:32,705
Have you done a background check on her?

241
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:34,290
Not yet.

242
00:14:35,332 --> 00:14:37,042
I'm sure you'll like her though.

243
00:14:37,126 --> 00:14:40,337
But still, ask her social security number
so that we can vet her.

244
00:14:40,421 --> 00:14:41,547
Don't worry.

245
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:44,717
By the way, she sent
her resume via e-mail.

246
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,927
Really? She sure keeps up with technology.

247
00:14:47,344 --> 00:14:48,262
How old is she?

248
00:14:48,846 --> 00:14:50,973
She was born in 1972,
so she's 45 this year.

249
00:14:52,016 --> 00:14:53,767
-Isn't she too young then?
-Is she pretty?

250
00:14:57,396 --> 00:14:58,647
Why do you need to know that?

251
00:14:59,189 --> 00:15:00,941
Looks matter to me a great deal.

252
00:15:01,942 --> 00:15:04,403
She seems to have a great personality.

253
00:15:04,486 --> 00:15:07,615
-That means she's not pretty.
-You'll like her.

254
00:15:07,698 --> 00:15:09,783
I'll fire her if that's not the case.

255
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:13,579
Are you wearing makeup?

256
00:15:15,372 --> 00:15:18,751
-No, I'm not.
-Your brows look like furry caterpillars.

257
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:27,009
It looks like Dad needs new hearing aids.

258
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:28,510
He's getting louder and louder.

259
00:15:30,554 --> 00:15:31,639
I want to pee.

260
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:50,074
Did you get your ballet shoes
from Aunt Jin-hee?

261
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:52,493
My feet must've grown. My toes hurt.

262
00:15:52,701 --> 00:15:54,662
She said I need to get new ones.

263
00:15:54,828 --> 00:15:56,747
Then, how about you just quit ballet now?

264
00:15:57,373 --> 00:15:59,833
I don't care either way.

265
00:16:00,167 --> 00:16:01,877
Your legs will get muscular
if you keep doing it.

266
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:03,504
I just wanted to fix your figure.

267
00:16:03,587 --> 00:16:06,256
The plan was to learn it
for only two years anyway, right?

268
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:10,177
Ballet is all right, but I actually want
to stop learning Chinese.

269
00:16:10,386 --> 00:16:13,305
Say that in Chinese.
"I want to stop learning Chinese."

270
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:18,686
Just keep taking the lessons
until you can say that in Chinese, okay?

271
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:22,147
Bye.

272
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:26,318
I can't believe Dad still goes on
about women's looks at that age.

273
00:16:26,944 --> 00:16:29,113
I think that lady will be great
for the job.

274
00:16:29,196 --> 00:16:30,739
She has worked a lot as a caregiver.

275
00:16:30,948 --> 00:16:34,618
But she seems very intelligent.
She even knows Matisse and Kandinsky.

276
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:35,828
What's that?

277
00:16:36,704 --> 00:16:37,830
What do you think?

278
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:40,708
Matisse and Kandinsky.
Are they dog breeds?

279
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:42,668
New whiskey?

280
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:44,044
They're artists.

281
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:46,714
They sound too generic.
Artists' names should be more unique

282
00:16:46,797 --> 00:16:48,507
like van Gogh, Gauguin, and Picasso.

283
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:51,093
By the way, how does she know
about those artists?

284
00:16:51,218 --> 00:16:52,886
They have nothing to do with caregiving.

285
00:16:53,554 --> 00:16:55,931
It's okay that you don't know
who Matisse and Kandinsky are,

286
00:16:56,181 --> 00:16:58,976
but the way you think
makes you look so ignorant.

287
00:16:59,059 --> 00:17:00,477
What? Ignorant?

288
00:17:00,894 --> 00:17:02,604
Gosh. Aren't you taking that back?

289
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:05,524
I never take back what I already said.
Forget about it if it bothers you.

290
00:17:05,774 --> 00:17:07,651
-Ji-hu.
-How can I forget?

291
00:17:07,735 --> 00:17:09,987
You said I'm ignorant.
How can I forget hearing it?

292
00:17:10,154 --> 00:17:11,447
Take it back already!

293
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:13,490
HISTORY OF 20TH-CENTURY ART

294
00:18:00,454 --> 00:18:01,288
Hello?

295
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:05,918
Don't you worry. I'll do a good job.

296
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:09,463
Keep your lips sealed yourself.

297
00:18:12,007 --> 00:18:12,841
Yes.

298
00:18:13,675 --> 00:18:14,927
All right.

299
00:18:17,012 --> 00:18:18,347
MS. A-JIN WOO

300
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:24,478
My gosh, Ms. Woo.

301
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:27,731
Yes. You need a copy
of my social security card?

302
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:31,944
Yes, that's no problem.
I'll bring it tomorrow.

303
00:18:32,653 --> 00:18:34,321
Gosh, please don't worry about it.

304
00:18:34,404 --> 00:18:35,322
Yes.

305
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:38,325
Hiring the right person is so important.

306
00:18:38,492 --> 00:18:40,744
You have to be careful
about whom you hire.

307
00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:43,372
Would you need my family register too?

308
00:18:45,332 --> 00:18:48,460
Okay. I'll see you tomorrow. Bye.

309
00:19:05,602 --> 00:19:08,063
Push out. All the way.

310
00:19:11,525 --> 00:19:12,985
Please try to hold it when you go down.

311
00:19:21,869 --> 00:19:23,829
I heard that both of his sons
are helpless.

312
00:19:23,954 --> 00:19:27,583
He sent his elder son to the States
after he beat someone to death.

313
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:30,085
His younger son is the big shot
in the company,

314
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:31,587
but even he's not that capable.

315
00:19:32,129 --> 00:19:33,338
Is he seriously ill?

316
00:19:33,422 --> 00:19:36,383
He's had a stroke, and he's even suffering
from diabetes complications.

317
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:37,634
His hearing is bad too.

318
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:41,680
Did you tell him
that he should hire a caregiver?

319
00:19:41,805 --> 00:19:44,391
I told him again today. He said
he'd talk to his daughter-in-law about it.

320
00:19:59,156 --> 00:20:00,949
-I'll head out first.
-Oh, wait.

321
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:04,453
Buy whatever you want to get.

322
00:20:05,412 --> 00:20:07,122
-Okay.
-Bye, Min-su.

323
00:20:07,247 --> 00:20:09,124
I'll see you next time
we play golf, Seong-ju.

324
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:12,502
I didn't know

325
00:20:12,628 --> 00:20:15,297
that there was a way you can change
your name without a court visit.

326
00:20:17,424 --> 00:20:21,178
Then, there are people who are dying

327
00:20:21,345 --> 00:20:23,096
to make their name known
as soon as possible.

328
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:24,181
Romantic French-girl style

329
00:20:24,264 --> 00:20:26,016
What's the difference
between waiting and longing?

330
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:33,857
And there are also people

331
00:20:34,191 --> 00:20:37,569
who are trying to keep
their children's names in the dark.

332
00:20:37,736 --> 00:20:40,489
Ms. A-jin Woo, who was formerly named
the best flight attendant in the company

333
00:20:40,822 --> 00:20:43,033
will give a special lecture for us today.

334
00:20:43,116 --> 00:20:45,118
They're now used to being addressed

335
00:20:45,452 --> 00:20:47,496
as someone's mom
instead of by their own names,

336
00:20:47,996 --> 00:20:51,291
but some of them are lucky enough
to get opportunities

337
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:52,960
to use their names from time to time.

338
00:20:56,672 --> 00:20:58,257
-Please take him to the hospital.
-Yes, ma'am.

339
00:20:58,340 --> 00:20:59,967
I don't want to get that injection today.

340
00:21:00,384 --> 00:21:02,261
You're not getting
any injection today, Father.

341
00:21:02,344 --> 00:21:04,596
Dr. Jo said that he'd just like
to see how you're doing.

342
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,723
That jerk looks like a con man.

343
00:21:07,015 --> 00:21:09,685
That's not true, Father.
What are you talking about?

344
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:11,770
You trust people too much.

345
00:21:12,604 --> 00:21:15,274
That's why you married
that idiot, Jae-seok.

346
00:21:26,743 --> 00:21:28,203
ONE MISSED CALL
CURATOR EUN-SEO PARK

347
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:34,751
Ms. Park, I just saw
that I missed your call.

348
00:21:35,002 --> 00:21:38,213
The artist, Seong-hui Yun
really would like to meet you.

349
00:21:38,463 --> 00:21:39,881
May I give her your number?

350
00:21:40,215 --> 00:21:42,592
No, you can just give me her number.

351
00:21:42,926 --> 00:21:43,927
I'll call her.

352
00:21:44,761 --> 00:21:46,680
Thank you so much, Ms. Woo.

353
00:21:46,763 --> 00:21:49,224
I'm honored that you're my first client.

354
00:21:49,433 --> 00:21:50,684
It's my pleasure.

355
00:21:51,184 --> 00:21:54,187
A close friend of mine is married
to the president of Hawon Group.

356
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:57,691
She has a gallery and is on the lookout
for a talented rookie artist.

357
00:21:58,025 --> 00:21:59,109
I'll introduce you to her.

358
00:21:59,234 --> 00:22:01,361
I'd be honored to meet her. Thank you.

359
00:22:01,445 --> 00:22:02,988
Please produce good work.

360
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:06,783
I'm investing in you.

361
00:22:07,576 --> 00:22:09,453
It's rude to say such things
to artists, isn't it?

362
00:22:09,745 --> 00:22:10,787
Not at all.

363
00:22:10,954 --> 00:22:13,498
Art can't be separated
from the commercial world.

364
00:22:13,749 --> 00:22:16,460
It's not like money will fall into my lap
so that I can buy paints.

365
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,380
By the way, you're so beautiful.

366
00:22:22,507 --> 00:22:24,426
I'm flattered. Thank you.

367
00:22:25,343 --> 00:22:27,304
I can't beat your youth though.

368
00:22:29,264 --> 00:22:30,307
Do you have any children?

369
00:22:30,557 --> 00:22:32,726
I have a daughter. She's in third grade.

370
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:34,895
I bet she's so pretty
if she takes after you.

371
00:22:35,145 --> 00:22:36,688
I can't deny that.

372
00:22:38,148 --> 00:22:40,567
How about I teach her art
whenever I have some time?

373
00:22:41,693 --> 00:22:42,611
Are you serious?

374
00:22:51,995 --> 00:22:53,789
You call that a painting?
It looks like a cartoon.

375
00:22:54,206 --> 00:22:55,749
I've seen things like that in web comics.

376
00:22:55,832 --> 00:22:59,086
She'll become the most renowned pop artist
in Korea in ten years from now.

377
00:22:59,169 --> 00:23:00,045
You just watch.

378
00:23:02,005 --> 00:23:03,548
You know
we're playing golf tomorrow, right?

379
00:23:03,632 --> 00:23:06,593
Gosh, I hate those guys.
Do we have to play golf with them?

380
00:23:06,676 --> 00:23:08,303
Try to get along with them, please.

381
00:23:08,386 --> 00:23:10,847
Do-hyeon's dad helped Father
with the site for the factory.

382
00:23:11,139 --> 00:23:15,018
Everything starts
from human relationships.

383
00:23:15,435 --> 00:23:17,437
I bet they're no match for me.

384
00:23:17,604 --> 00:23:20,190
What are you talking about? Yun-jae's dad
is an ex-professional golfer.

385
00:23:20,357 --> 00:23:22,609
You're just a beginner compared to him.

386
00:23:23,276 --> 00:23:25,904
Who is Yun-jae's dad?
What does he look like?

387
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:30,117
-Good shot!
-The one who looks like a weasel.

388
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,076
You remember him, right?

389
00:23:34,621 --> 00:23:35,539
What's the score now?

390
00:23:35,747 --> 00:23:37,457
Jae-seok: 4, Bong-sik: 0
Seong-su: 1, Mun-tak: 1

391
00:23:50,846 --> 00:23:53,056
Oh, no. It went out of bounds.

392
00:23:58,603 --> 00:24:00,147
Nice, you got par.

393
00:24:00,647 --> 00:24:03,191
It looks like she's been
practicing golf day and night.

394
00:24:09,823 --> 00:24:10,657
Out of bounds.

395
00:24:12,033 --> 00:24:15,412
Shall we ask Yun-jae's dad
to tutor all of us together?

396
00:24:15,495 --> 00:24:17,205
Women have affairs
with their golf instructors.

397
00:24:18,165 --> 00:24:20,417
-Sorry?
-What if one of us do that?

398
00:24:21,001 --> 00:24:22,544
Gi-ok, stop joking around.

399
00:24:23,003 --> 00:24:25,046
He makes my heart flutter.

400
00:24:25,213 --> 00:24:26,715
I'd be nice to date a younger guy.

401
00:24:27,549 --> 00:24:29,259
Then, shall we swap husbands?

402
00:24:29,551 --> 00:24:31,344
Hey, I'd obviously love that.

403
00:24:32,554 --> 00:24:33,597
You'll regret it.

404
00:24:37,058 --> 00:24:38,143
What's the matter with her?

405
00:24:39,227 --> 00:24:41,104
-Let's take a short break.
-Okay!

406
00:24:48,778 --> 00:24:50,614
I'm so embarrassed.

407
00:24:57,287 --> 00:24:58,288
SCORECARD

408
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:03,210
I found it.

409
00:25:05,712 --> 00:25:07,047
Jae-seok, your ball is here.

410
00:25:08,924 --> 00:25:10,175
That's not mine.

411
00:25:11,092 --> 00:25:12,010
It's really not mine.

412
00:25:12,969 --> 00:25:15,639
-The one I just hit is a bit different.
-How is it different?

413
00:25:17,432 --> 00:25:19,726
I made a mark on it with my fingernail.

414
00:25:20,727 --> 00:25:22,187
Do you know what the 19th hole mean?

415
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:27,776
It refers to where those
in extramarital relationships go

416
00:25:27,943 --> 00:25:29,152
after the 18th hole.

417
00:25:32,864 --> 00:25:34,157
My goodness.

418
00:25:35,492 --> 00:25:37,202
Raise your hand
if you have a secret lover.

419
00:25:39,955 --> 00:25:41,873
Right, who'd actually raise a hand?

420
00:25:43,291 --> 00:25:45,085
You're really something.

421
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:47,629
Did you actually make your husband
get his eyebrows tattooed?

422
00:25:48,004 --> 00:25:49,673
I should prevent it, you know.

423
00:25:49,798 --> 00:25:52,133
If it actually happens,
the aftermath will be such a headache.

424
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:55,929
Right. Your father-in-law
used to be a total philanderer, right?

425
00:25:56,304 --> 00:25:57,514
That runs in the blood too.

426
00:25:57,681 --> 00:25:59,683
Don't say that, please.
It's so horrendous.

427
00:26:00,934 --> 00:26:02,560
There are two types of men.

428
00:26:02,852 --> 00:26:06,106
Those who cheat on their wives
and those who want to cheat.

429
00:26:07,148 --> 00:26:10,443
Ponder on which category
your husband may belong.

430
00:26:13,029 --> 00:26:14,906
Hey, is he doing well these days?

431
00:26:18,702 --> 00:26:21,371
The binary species is swarming over here.

432
00:26:23,957 --> 00:26:25,625
We're here.

433
00:26:25,792 --> 00:26:27,627
Gosh, I'm tired. Hello.

434
00:26:27,711 --> 00:26:28,878
Hello.

435
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:32,299
Shall we have dinner together
when we're done?

436
00:26:32,632 --> 00:26:35,218
-Sure, meet me in front of the clubhouse.
-Okay.

437
00:26:36,136 --> 00:26:38,722
-Good job.
-I'm not hungry though.

438
00:26:58,408 --> 00:26:59,743
It's nice to meet you.

439
00:27:00,285 --> 00:27:01,911
I'm Bok-ja Park.

440
00:27:02,162 --> 00:27:03,663
Thank you in advance for all of your help.

441
00:27:03,747 --> 00:27:05,790
A-jin has a golf get-together today.

442
00:27:05,874 --> 00:27:09,085
I already spoke to her on the phone.
I should get to work now.

443
00:27:09,336 --> 00:27:10,170
Wait.

444
00:27:11,087 --> 00:27:12,839
Did you bring a copy
of your social security card?

445
00:27:13,006 --> 00:27:13,882
Yes.

446
00:27:16,718 --> 00:27:18,470
I'll give it to Ms. Woo.

447
00:27:54,214 --> 00:27:57,092
Hello, Mr. Chairman.
Did you have a good sleep?

448
00:28:01,221 --> 00:28:02,347
Let me help you.

449
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:05,016
Careful.

450
00:28:08,645 --> 00:28:09,604
Please be careful.

451
00:28:10,021 --> 00:28:11,773
Please try to sit up like this.

452
00:28:18,488 --> 00:28:19,406
Ms. Park.

453
00:28:20,824 --> 00:28:22,659
Did you go
into my father-in-law's room already?

454
00:28:23,618 --> 00:28:24,452
Well...

455
00:28:24,536 --> 00:28:25,703
What do you mean?

456
00:28:25,995 --> 00:28:27,997
When Ms. Woo and I were going over
my contract together,

457
00:28:28,081 --> 00:28:31,376
we decided that I'll start
at 7 a.m. today.

458
00:28:33,253 --> 00:28:34,546
It's 10 a.m. now.

459
00:28:37,841 --> 00:28:41,511
I'll use Mr. Chairman's bathroom
in his room.

460
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:44,848
To look after him all day...

461
00:28:44,931 --> 00:28:46,057
No, you can't.

462
00:28:46,599 --> 00:28:48,643
There are six bathrooms in this house.

463
00:28:48,977 --> 00:28:50,311
Please use the one upstairs.

464
00:28:51,396 --> 00:28:52,522
Well, ma'am.

465
00:28:53,022 --> 00:28:56,359
I'd like to take excellent care
of Mr. Chairman.

466
00:28:56,609 --> 00:29:00,280
If you're too condescending toward me,

467
00:29:00,405 --> 00:29:03,908
I won't be able
to look after him wholeheartedly.

468
00:29:04,701 --> 00:29:06,786
Everything is relative, you know.

469
00:29:09,998 --> 00:29:13,293
Do you not care about him sincerely?

470
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:17,464
You and Ms. Woo are very different.

471
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:21,676
Ms. Park.

472
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:25,180
Where is the bathroom upstairs?
I'll just use that one.

473
00:29:25,263 --> 00:29:26,723
Don't you understand hierarchy?

474
00:29:32,937 --> 00:29:35,523
Who is above whom in that hierarchy
you're speaking of?

475
00:29:38,318 --> 00:29:41,154
I don't really know
what I've done to deserve hearing

476
00:29:41,237 --> 00:29:42,739
such a remark from you.

477
00:29:43,448 --> 00:29:47,035
I have to relieve myself.
I need to use the bathroom now.

478
00:29:48,328 --> 00:29:50,079
I guess it's somewhere upstairs.

479
00:30:25,532 --> 00:30:26,908
What is going on?

480
00:30:29,953 --> 00:30:31,412
I'm sorry, sir.

481
00:30:33,248 --> 00:30:34,415
I went upstairs

482
00:30:34,791 --> 00:30:37,710
to use the bathroom, but ended up...

483
00:30:38,419 --> 00:30:40,421
There's a bathroom inside my room.

484
00:30:41,047 --> 00:30:43,091
Why did you go upstairs
and cause this rumpus?

485
00:30:43,216 --> 00:30:44,968
Father, it's actually...

486
00:30:45,051 --> 00:30:48,012
I should use the one upstairs.

487
00:30:48,304 --> 00:30:51,766
Not many people would be understanding
about those under them

488
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:53,351
sharing the same bathroom with them.

489
00:30:54,894 --> 00:30:58,189
I'll use the one upstairs.

490
00:30:59,232 --> 00:31:01,985
I'm sorry about the noise.

491
00:31:04,654 --> 00:31:06,739
Everyone is equal.

492
00:31:07,323 --> 00:31:09,659
And why would you tell her
to use the bathroom upstairs

493
00:31:09,742 --> 00:31:11,202
when there's one on the main floor?

494
00:31:11,744 --> 00:31:12,704
Well, that was...

495
00:31:13,454 --> 00:31:14,998
Age wisely, please.

496
00:31:28,177 --> 00:31:30,930
Aren't you hungry, Aunt?
Why do you always feed me and eat nothing?

497
00:31:31,431 --> 00:31:33,141
I told you that I'm trying to lose weight.

498
00:31:33,641 --> 00:31:35,643
Oh, right. I'm sorry.

499
00:31:35,768 --> 00:31:38,104
I forgot that you're on a diet.

500
00:31:38,396 --> 00:31:40,773
The smell filled the whole car. Sorry.

501
00:31:42,525 --> 00:31:44,903
You know that you'll meet
your art teacher today, right?

502
00:31:44,986 --> 00:31:46,487
-Yes.
-But

503
00:31:46,571 --> 00:31:49,657
I think you're taking too many lessons.
Your brain might be burnt out soon.

504
00:31:49,866 --> 00:31:52,368
My brain probably looks like this now.

505
00:31:53,703 --> 00:31:55,872
Just tell your mom
that you want to cut down.

506
00:31:56,039 --> 00:31:57,874
I'll do my best before I give up.

507
00:31:58,249 --> 00:32:00,919
I just quit ballet, and she already filled
my schedule with art lessons.

508
00:32:01,127 --> 00:32:03,421
My schedule is completely full.

509
00:32:04,005 --> 00:32:05,131
What do you hate the most?

510
00:32:05,423 --> 00:32:06,382
Chinese.

511
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:07,759
Chinese!

512
00:32:08,801 --> 00:32:10,720
You know your grandpa's factory
is in China.

513
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:12,472
Wouldn't that be
why you're studying Chinese?

514
00:32:12,555 --> 00:32:13,848
How is that relevant?

515
00:32:14,015 --> 00:32:17,018
Who do you think will inherit the factory?
It's obviously you.

516
00:32:17,143 --> 00:32:20,313
There's Dad and Un-gyu.
What are you talking about?

517
00:32:21,272 --> 00:32:22,106
That's true.

518
00:32:22,607 --> 00:32:25,443
I guess I've been watching
too many American TV series lately.

519
00:32:26,277 --> 00:32:27,987
One of them

520
00:32:28,529 --> 00:32:31,950
is about a 17-year-old girl inheriting
several hundred thousand dollars.

521
00:32:32,033 --> 00:32:34,285
Aunt Jin-hee, I'll tell you a secret.

522
00:32:34,452 --> 00:32:36,162
Do you know what I want to be
when I grow up?

523
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:38,748
A stationery store owner.

524
00:32:38,998 --> 00:32:41,918
Goodness. Your mom will faint
if she hears that.

525
00:32:42,001 --> 00:32:44,712
Considering my general aptitude,
I think that'd be the best job for me.

526
00:32:45,588 --> 00:32:46,422
Why?

527
00:32:46,714 --> 00:32:49,926
Because all of my customers would be dumb.

528
00:32:50,218 --> 00:32:52,470
I wouldn't need
to treat them like royalty.

529
00:33:01,771 --> 00:33:03,147
We're here.

530
00:33:04,065 --> 00:33:06,317
It's on the third floor, Unit 306.

531
00:33:06,859 --> 00:33:08,111
Let's go up together.

532
00:33:11,364 --> 00:33:12,865
-Hello.
-Hello.

533
00:33:13,616 --> 00:33:14,951
My gosh, are you Ji-hu?

534
00:33:15,034 --> 00:33:17,537
Hello, I'm Ji-hu Ahn.

535
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:20,331
Wow, you're so pretty and polite.

536
00:33:20,415 --> 00:33:22,792
Well, what time should I pick her up?

537
00:33:22,875 --> 00:33:24,794
I'll call you when we're done.

538
00:33:25,211 --> 00:33:29,090
By the way,
what's your relationship with A-jin?

539
00:33:29,799 --> 00:33:30,675
Well...

540
00:33:31,467 --> 00:33:34,470
I'm just helping her out.
I'm like her secretary.

541
00:33:34,554 --> 00:33:35,972
Oh, her secretary?

542
00:33:36,055 --> 00:33:39,559
Yes, you can think of me
as her personal assistant

543
00:33:39,642 --> 00:33:40,977
that manages her day-to-day things.

544
00:33:41,853 --> 00:33:43,563
I didn't know that there was such a thing.

545
00:33:43,813 --> 00:33:46,441
I don't know about that.
It's just what the two of us do.

546
00:33:46,983 --> 00:33:48,609
Anyway, please call me when you're done.

547
00:33:48,693 --> 00:33:50,778
Okay, I will. Come in.

548
00:33:51,237 --> 00:33:52,155
See you.

549
00:34:02,749 --> 00:34:04,167
What do you think of Dr. Jang?

550
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:06,085
-What?
-Gosh.

551
00:34:07,086 --> 00:34:09,464
Oh, no. It went out of bounds.

552
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:12,300
He talks way too much,
and all he does is brag about himself.

553
00:34:12,508 --> 00:34:14,469
Most people know that he hires brokers

554
00:34:14,552 --> 00:34:17,972
to get patients and that all procedures
are done by other plastic surgeons.

555
00:34:18,181 --> 00:34:20,099
And that guy, Bong-sik Kim.

556
00:34:20,183 --> 00:34:21,559
Jae-seok, your ball is here.

557
00:34:21,809 --> 00:34:24,479
That dude looks a little dumb.

558
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:28,024
And that man, Mun-tak Seo.
The CEO of the hotel.

559
00:34:29,984 --> 00:34:33,071
He bragged
about having a secret girlfriend.

560
00:34:33,362 --> 00:34:35,406
What's he going to do if I tell you?

561
00:34:35,698 --> 00:34:39,160
Right, you shouldn't be telling me.

562
00:34:39,243 --> 00:34:40,244
Why shouldn't I?

563
00:34:41,287 --> 00:34:42,371
It's such scandalous news.

564
00:34:44,582 --> 00:34:46,626
Did Dr. Jang mention anything like that
by any chance?

565
00:34:47,126 --> 00:34:50,213
-What do you mean?
-Well, things like having a girlfriend.

566
00:34:50,296 --> 00:34:54,342
No, he just said that he'll tell me
about a stamina-boosting supplement.

567
00:34:54,717 --> 00:34:56,219
That means he has a girlfriend, right?

568
00:34:56,427 --> 00:34:58,304
Why would it mean that?

569
00:34:59,138 --> 00:35:00,932
Why would he take it for his wife?

570
00:35:02,683 --> 00:35:04,143
I'm sorry that I have to say this,

571
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:07,230
but you're honestly
so much like your father.

572
00:35:07,313 --> 00:35:09,440
Gosh, hey. Take back what you just said.

573
00:35:09,524 --> 00:35:11,943
I never take back what I already said.
Just forget about it.

574
00:35:13,528 --> 00:35:15,863
That caregiver is starting today, right?

575
00:35:16,697 --> 00:35:17,615
Yes.

576
00:35:21,077 --> 00:35:21,953
Hello?

577
00:35:22,537 --> 00:35:24,080
Yes, today must've been
exhausting for you.

578
00:35:25,706 --> 00:35:27,416
Okay, I will. You should hurry home.

579
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:28,918
You're off tomorrow, so get some rest.

580
00:35:29,502 --> 00:35:32,046
If Ji-hu texts you,
just ignore her messages.

581
00:35:32,588 --> 00:35:33,506
All right.

582
00:35:35,383 --> 00:35:36,843
Jin-hee has to hurry home now.

583
00:35:36,926 --> 00:35:39,095
Her brother will bring
his fiancée home tomorrow,

584
00:35:39,178 --> 00:35:42,640
but her mom got the date mixed up
and haven't even started cooking yet.

585
00:35:43,558 --> 00:35:44,725
You should pick up Ji-hu.

586
00:35:44,934 --> 00:35:47,311
I need to go to Father's place
to sort things out.

587
00:35:48,604 --> 00:35:50,356
-Where am I going?
-I told you.

588
00:35:50,439 --> 00:35:51,858
Pick Ji-hu up from her art lesson.

589
00:35:52,066 --> 00:35:53,192
Oh, that web comic artist.

590
00:35:53,734 --> 00:35:57,613
Dear, you better not say
anything inappropriate or ignorant.

591
00:35:57,697 --> 00:36:00,199
If you do, you'll end up
massively humiliating yourself.

592
00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:03,744
But wouldn't it be better
if I go to Dad's place,

593
00:36:03,828 --> 00:36:05,496
and you go there?

594
00:36:05,621 --> 00:36:08,833
No, things must be
pretty tense there by now.

595
00:36:08,916 --> 00:36:12,295
I'll sort it out.
You'll only make things worse.

596
00:36:12,503 --> 00:36:15,298
Oh, right. Don't forget to pick up
Father's hearing aids tomorrow, okay?

597
00:36:15,798 --> 00:36:16,632
All right.

598
00:36:22,638 --> 00:36:23,556
Where's Ms. Park?

599
00:36:26,142 --> 00:36:27,143
Ms. Park!

600
00:36:34,817 --> 00:36:36,194
Yes, sir.

601
00:36:36,569 --> 00:36:37,528
Eat with us.

602
00:36:38,905 --> 00:36:42,658
I'll eat with Ms. Jo later.

603
00:36:42,742 --> 00:36:44,285
Just join us.

604
00:36:45,453 --> 00:36:47,705
-Father.
-It's okay, Mr. Chairman.

605
00:36:48,372 --> 00:36:50,249
I'll eat later.

606
00:36:51,959 --> 00:36:54,879
I don't want to feel uneasy
when I eat because I won't be able

607
00:36:55,588 --> 00:36:57,048
to digest the food.

608
00:37:02,136 --> 00:37:05,056
I'll go prepare your bed for you.

609
00:37:05,556 --> 00:37:09,268
By the way, I noticed
that your bedsheets are pilling.

610
00:37:09,602 --> 00:37:11,479
I'd like to change them.

611
00:37:11,562 --> 00:37:14,315
I think it's the 100 percent
natural bed linen that A-jin bought

612
00:37:14,398 --> 00:37:16,025
directly from a manufacturer overseas.

613
00:37:16,567 --> 00:37:19,278
All-natural fabrics
are more prone to pilling.

614
00:37:19,904 --> 00:37:22,281
It must be very uncomfortable.

615
00:37:22,865 --> 00:37:25,534
I'll buy new sheets tomorrow.

616
00:37:25,618 --> 00:37:27,495
I can just use that one myself.

617
00:37:30,831 --> 00:37:32,541
Hello, Ms. Woo.

618
00:37:32,625 --> 00:37:33,668
I'm sorry, Ms. Park.

619
00:37:33,751 --> 00:37:35,670
I know it's your first day,
but I had other plans.

620
00:37:35,753 --> 00:37:38,589
Gosh, please don't worry about it.
It's not like I'm a kid.

621
00:37:39,465 --> 00:37:40,925
Everything is going well, right?

622
00:37:42,301 --> 00:37:44,553
I hurt my back a little,

623
00:37:44,845 --> 00:37:46,472
but I think I'll be fine soon.

624
00:37:46,555 --> 00:37:47,890
You hurt your back?

625
00:37:48,557 --> 00:37:50,434
There was a bit of a situation.

626
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:52,687
I'll talk to you later.

627
00:37:53,229 --> 00:37:54,605
You should have dinner.

628
00:37:56,816 --> 00:37:58,818
Ms. Woo, would you like
to have dinner now?

629
00:37:58,985 --> 00:38:00,236
It's okay. I already ate.

630
00:38:04,824 --> 00:38:05,700
Father.

631
00:38:06,117 --> 00:38:07,243
Do you like her?

632
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:10,663
She's not that good-looking,

633
00:38:11,247 --> 00:38:14,292
but it looks like she has
a good personality like you said,

634
00:38:15,042 --> 00:38:16,335
so I'll see how things go.

635
00:38:20,047 --> 00:38:22,216
What about you, Ju-mi? You don't like her?

636
00:38:22,466 --> 00:38:23,884
We can talk about it privately.

637
00:38:30,766 --> 00:38:32,268
Unit 306.

638
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:43,571
My gosh, are you Ji-hu's dad?

639
00:38:46,198 --> 00:38:48,117
Yes. Hello.

640
00:38:48,993 --> 00:38:50,328
I'm here to pick her up.

641
00:38:50,453 --> 00:38:52,455
It looks like we'll need
about 30 more minutes.

642
00:38:52,538 --> 00:38:53,748
Then, I'll wait in the car.

643
00:38:53,831 --> 00:38:56,000
Please come in.
You can look at her drawing too.

644
00:38:56,459 --> 00:38:59,920
-No, it's okay.
-Jin-hee said that A-jin would be coming,

645
00:39:00,004 --> 00:39:02,965
so I made some light snacks
to eat with her as well.

646
00:39:07,470 --> 00:39:08,596
Okay. Ji-hu.

647
00:39:19,023 --> 00:39:21,650
Ju-mi, you don't like her that much?

648
00:39:21,734 --> 00:39:22,568
A-jin.

649
00:39:24,528 --> 00:39:26,072
I don't think she's right for the job.

650
00:39:26,405 --> 00:39:27,323
Why?

651
00:39:27,573 --> 00:39:30,368
She totally creeps me out.

652
00:39:30,493 --> 00:39:31,827
Is that the only reason?

653
00:39:31,911 --> 00:39:35,373
I have exceptionally good instincts.

654
00:39:36,874 --> 00:39:38,542
Even the day when Jae-gu
got himself in trouble,

655
00:39:38,751 --> 00:39:41,712
I got chills down my spine for no reason.

656
00:39:42,797 --> 00:39:44,340
That's exactly
how she's making me feel now.

657
00:39:44,965 --> 00:39:46,300
Let's fire her, okay?

658
00:39:49,011 --> 00:39:51,430
If you feel that way, we should.
All right.

659
00:39:51,555 --> 00:39:52,890
I'll speak with her tomorrow.

660
00:40:20,376 --> 00:40:21,335
Is it good?

661
00:40:22,002 --> 00:40:25,005
It's so good. This tteok-bokki
literally melts in your mouth.

662
00:40:26,215 --> 00:40:28,968
Ji-hu doesn't want to eat it because
she had a sandwich on her way here.

663
00:40:29,176 --> 00:40:30,803
She said that tteok-bokki has 300kcal

664
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:34,098
and that anything she eats after 7 p.m.
makes her put on weight on her thighs.

665
00:40:39,895 --> 00:40:42,231
She's very expressive.
She gets that from me.

666
00:40:43,691 --> 00:40:44,608
Here.

667
00:40:47,236 --> 00:40:48,446
No, it's here.

668
00:40:49,655 --> 00:40:50,489
I didn't get it?

669
00:41:03,544 --> 00:41:04,545
Hey, Ji-hu.

670
00:41:06,088 --> 00:41:09,133
She learned the basic techniques well.
I think she has the talent.

671
00:41:09,216 --> 00:41:12,052
-Oh, really?
-Do you like paintings?

672
00:41:12,136 --> 00:41:14,180
-I love paintings.
-Who's your favorite painter?

673
00:41:15,014 --> 00:41:16,474
Matisse and Kandinsky.

674
00:41:18,976 --> 00:41:20,019
Who's your favorite?

675
00:41:20,769 --> 00:41:22,688
I'm a fan of Damien Hirst.

676
00:41:23,939 --> 00:41:24,899
-Seriously?
-Yes.

677
00:41:24,982 --> 00:41:26,817
He's my third favorite artist.

678
00:41:27,026 --> 00:41:29,445
Matisse, Kandinsky, and Damien Horst.

679
00:41:29,904 --> 00:41:30,821
-Really?
-Yes.

680
00:41:30,905 --> 00:41:33,115
My Matisse and Kandinsky

681
00:41:33,574 --> 00:41:37,703
were making history like that elsewhere,

682
00:41:39,788 --> 00:41:43,459
and this frozen persimmon dessert,
which Ms. Jo had worked so hard to make

683
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:48,672
became my Matisse

684
00:41:49,006 --> 00:41:51,091
and Kandinsky of the day.

685
00:41:56,013 --> 00:41:57,056
Wow.

686
00:41:57,806 --> 00:42:00,601
I can't believe that I'm seeing
such incredible work right before my eyes.

687
00:42:00,935 --> 00:42:02,228
You're making me blush.

688
00:42:02,394 --> 00:42:04,188
All I can say is that it's incredible.

689
00:42:04,396 --> 00:42:06,982
Painters have been criticizing pop art,
saying that it's not

690
00:42:07,066 --> 00:42:08,943
a form of pure art.

691
00:42:09,068 --> 00:42:10,486
They often say it's like cartoons.

692
00:42:10,986 --> 00:42:13,739
How ignorant. Cartoons? That's crazy.

693
00:42:13,822 --> 00:42:15,241
I can understand.

694
00:42:15,366 --> 00:42:17,618
Even the illustrator and painter,
Norman Rockwell was treated

695
00:42:17,701 --> 00:42:21,121
like a magazine illustrator in the States
at the beginning of his career.

696
00:42:21,497 --> 00:42:25,501
Don't even worry
what those art illiterates say.

697
00:42:25,876 --> 00:42:28,003
They think this looks like a cartoon?
Unbelievable.

698
00:42:28,170 --> 00:42:30,005
Dad, let's go home already.

699
00:42:30,089 --> 00:42:31,173
All right.

700
00:42:33,551 --> 00:42:34,969
Dad, let's go.

701
00:42:35,302 --> 00:42:38,389
Okay. Hey, isn't your teacher
so impressive?

702
00:42:38,514 --> 00:42:39,515
You deserve a thumbs-up.

703
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:55,656
I remember the calm
the day before the storm.

704
00:43:00,619 --> 00:43:01,912
PERSONAL INFORMATION

705
00:43:01,996 --> 00:43:05,291
NAME: BOK-JA PARK
SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER: 720813-2423124

706
00:43:08,919 --> 00:43:12,006
SEONG-HUI YUN

707
00:43:13,132 --> 00:43:14,133
Seong-hui Yun.

708
00:43:16,719 --> 00:43:17,636
Seong-hui Yun.

709
00:43:24,768 --> 00:43:26,186
MIN-SU

710
00:43:29,648 --> 00:43:32,776
When you hear the sound
of thunder at home,

711
00:43:33,152 --> 00:43:37,114
being safe from the possible danger
gives you a strange sense of relief.

712
00:43:37,197 --> 00:43:39,116
SEONG-JU

713
00:43:41,243 --> 00:43:42,119
However,

714
00:43:43,245 --> 00:43:46,165
when you're standing outside
without an umbrella, that sound

715
00:43:47,958 --> 00:43:49,335
gives you fear.

716
00:43:52,379 --> 00:43:55,049
That day, all of us

717
00:43:55,549 --> 00:43:57,384
were standing outside

718
00:43:58,969 --> 00:44:01,096
although we were the only ones
that didn't know.

719
00:44:06,018 --> 00:44:07,436
ELEMENTARY LEVEL
MATH COMPETITON

720
00:44:07,519 --> 00:44:10,105
Life is a repetition of tests
where we're required

721
00:44:10,189 --> 00:44:11,357
to choose the right answers,

722
00:44:12,149 --> 00:44:14,485
but the answer I chose

723
00:44:15,361 --> 00:44:17,237
was wrong every single time.

724
00:44:19,698 --> 00:44:22,493
I truly hoped that this one
would be the right answer.

725
00:44:23,494 --> 00:44:27,206
Henri Matisse.
Does that mean his surname is Henri?

726
00:44:28,791 --> 00:44:31,710
Just like how Ji-hu's dad was hoping
that Matisse and Kandinsky

727
00:44:31,794 --> 00:44:33,504
would be the right answer.

728
00:44:34,713 --> 00:44:36,632
-Isn't the result coming out on the 12th?
-Yes.

729
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:38,759
Last year's competition ratio
was eight to one.

730
00:44:38,967 --> 00:44:41,345
I know. It keeps on getting
more competitive.

731
00:44:41,595 --> 00:44:45,307
They must be putting more emphasis on math
because there's barely any gap.

732
00:44:45,516 --> 00:44:46,975
A-jin, you must feel at ease.

733
00:44:47,101 --> 00:44:49,103
Math is the subject
Ji-hu excels at the most.

734
00:44:49,561 --> 00:44:51,355
You know she's not thorough at all though.

735
00:44:51,438 --> 00:44:53,649
She always gets
the easiest questions wrong.

736
00:44:54,274 --> 00:44:55,234
Jeong-hyeon.

737
00:44:56,110 --> 00:44:57,861
I told you to call me by my name.

738
00:44:58,237 --> 00:44:59,780
Why do you keep calling me
by my kid's name?

739
00:44:59,863 --> 00:45:00,823
Anyhow,

740
00:45:01,115 --> 00:45:04,451
I want to get Derma Toxin and Restylane
Vital injections at your husband's clinic.

741
00:45:04,660 --> 00:45:07,162
How about I go with you
when you get your Botox?

742
00:45:07,246 --> 00:45:08,664
I got it done three days ago.

743
00:45:08,747 --> 00:45:11,375
I knew it. I was thinking
that your smile looked awkward.

744
00:45:12,042 --> 00:45:14,545
Should I get the Beyoncé injection?
I heard that it's pretty good.

745
00:45:14,628 --> 00:45:16,255
The Venus injection is better.

746
00:45:17,756 --> 00:45:20,175
You need to get fillers
for your nasolabial folds.

747
00:45:21,969 --> 00:45:23,178
Oh, the kids are coming out now.

748
00:45:24,430 --> 00:45:25,931
EXAMINATION ROOM

749
00:45:26,014 --> 00:45:27,933
-Mom!
-Be careful, guys.

750
00:45:28,016 --> 00:45:30,060
-Hey.
-Ji-hu!

751
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:34,189
A-jin...

752
00:45:34,398 --> 00:45:37,025
I mean, the wife of Daesung Pulp
Chairman's younger son.

753
00:45:37,484 --> 00:45:40,070
How did she meet her husband?

754
00:45:40,571 --> 00:45:41,530
Why do you ask?

755
00:45:41,697 --> 00:45:45,742
Well, I'm just curious as to how he won
the heart of such a beautiful lady.

756
00:45:46,577 --> 00:45:49,705
She used to be a flight attendant.

757
00:45:49,997 --> 00:45:53,208
You know those standing signboards
you see at travel agencies, right?

758
00:45:53,709 --> 00:45:55,043
She modeled for the company.

759
00:45:55,210 --> 00:45:58,672
Her husband fell in love with her
as soon as he saw the signboard,

760
00:45:59,047 --> 00:46:01,008
so he stole it.

761
00:46:01,508 --> 00:46:03,802
My gosh, that's so funny.

762
00:46:03,927 --> 00:46:07,014
I heard that her husband
is a bit of a character.

763
00:46:12,728 --> 00:46:13,770
JI-HU'S DAD

764
00:46:13,854 --> 00:46:16,231
I'd like to thank you
for the delicious tteok-bokki.

765
00:46:20,235 --> 00:46:22,613
-What's this fabric?
-It's microfiber.

766
00:46:22,696 --> 00:46:24,448
It's great for blankets.

767
00:46:26,074 --> 00:46:26,992
Hello.

768
00:46:28,994 --> 00:46:32,122
-Let's see. It's 100,000 won.
-Yes.

769
00:46:52,809 --> 00:46:54,061
CHAIRMAN AHN

770
00:46:59,608 --> 00:47:01,860
-Hello?
-What's taking you so long?

771
00:47:02,236 --> 00:47:04,655
You should've just sent someone.
Why did you go there yourself?

772
00:47:05,113 --> 00:47:07,366
This is important.
How can I let someone else do it?

773
00:47:07,908 --> 00:47:09,117
Anyway, come back quickly.

774
00:47:09,368 --> 00:47:11,578
I have a kinesiotherapy session today.

775
00:47:11,912 --> 00:47:13,205
You have to come with me.

776
00:47:13,413 --> 00:47:15,290
Yes, of course.

777
00:47:17,376 --> 00:47:18,877
Please wait for me.

778
00:47:20,337 --> 00:47:21,171
Okay.

779
00:47:27,761 --> 00:47:28,637
Excuse me.

780
00:47:29,429 --> 00:47:31,515
-Another serving of pork rinds, please.
-Yes.

781
00:47:31,932 --> 00:47:33,016
A bottle of soju too.

782
00:47:36,853 --> 00:47:38,272
DIMWIT BONG-CHEOL

783
00:47:40,023 --> 00:47:40,941
Yes, it's me.

784
00:47:42,192 --> 00:47:44,570
Chairman Ahn has a kinesiotherapy session
with you today, right?

785
00:47:44,903 --> 00:47:46,029
Move it to tomorrow.

786
00:47:47,906 --> 00:47:50,367
Just call him and tell him
that you need to reschedule it.

787
00:47:54,496 --> 00:47:55,330
Okay.

788
00:48:14,433 --> 00:48:17,603
This is high in collagen,

789
00:48:17,686 --> 00:48:19,021
so it's good for the skin.

790
00:48:20,230 --> 00:48:23,817
You already look much younger
than your age though.

791
00:48:24,693 --> 00:48:25,944
You think I look younger?

792
00:48:26,361 --> 00:48:29,990
Gosh, you look at least
ten years younger than your age.

793
00:48:31,658 --> 00:48:33,076
Please get better soon.

794
00:48:34,953 --> 00:48:38,874
You should enjoy everything
that young men do.

795
00:48:46,214 --> 00:48:47,883
I've actually been craving this.

796
00:48:48,592 --> 00:48:50,510
Back when I was going through a hard time,

797
00:48:50,636 --> 00:48:52,387
I used to eat this all the time.

798
00:48:56,266 --> 00:48:58,310
He said he's craving pork rinds.

799
00:48:58,810 --> 00:49:00,187
He can never eat it at home

800
00:49:00,270 --> 00:49:01,897
because his family says
it smells up the house.

801
00:49:26,922 --> 00:49:28,006
-Thanks.
-Yes.

802
00:49:37,641 --> 00:49:40,936
I'm telling you.
She's definitely talented in painting.

803
00:49:41,353 --> 00:49:43,105
Ms. Yun did a lot of it.

804
00:49:43,188 --> 00:49:45,524
She painted two out of ten petals

805
00:49:45,607 --> 00:49:47,275
to show me how I should do it.

806
00:49:47,359 --> 00:49:49,778
Anyhow, it looks very promising.

807
00:49:53,865 --> 00:49:56,159
Yes. I should visit Dad
before I head to work

808
00:49:56,827 --> 00:49:58,370
to meet the caregiver.

809
00:49:58,453 --> 00:50:00,789
There's no need
because we need to fire her.

810
00:50:00,956 --> 00:50:01,790
Why?

811
00:50:01,915 --> 00:50:04,376
Ju-mi really doesn't like her.

812
00:50:05,168 --> 00:50:06,878
Gosh, I just can't say it to her.

813
00:50:06,962 --> 00:50:09,297
I even arranged a room for her
and got her to move her stuff in.

814
00:50:09,381 --> 00:50:11,091
Ju-mi doesn't know her place.

815
00:50:11,258 --> 00:50:12,467
If she remembers what Jae-gu did,

816
00:50:12,551 --> 00:50:14,469
shouldn't she keep
her complaints to herself?

817
00:50:14,636 --> 00:50:15,887
That's not right.

818
00:50:15,971 --> 00:50:18,515
Your brother is the one
who made that mistake, not her.

819
00:50:18,682 --> 00:50:21,518
How a man behaves
depends on how his woman treats him.

820
00:50:21,601 --> 00:50:22,936
She's always so negative.

821
00:50:23,103 --> 00:50:24,855
Maybe that's why Jae-gu
ended up like that.

822
00:50:26,398 --> 00:50:28,191
Gosh, I need to go to Father's place now.

823
00:50:29,067 --> 00:50:31,027
Where am I going to find
another caregiver?

824
00:50:32,863 --> 00:50:34,531
Let's try to have a good day, everyone!

825
00:50:34,698 --> 00:50:36,032
-Have a good day!
-We can do it!

826
00:50:37,826 --> 00:50:39,286
Wow. Good shot!

827
00:50:40,704 --> 00:50:42,664
By the way, shouldn't we have checked

828
00:50:42,748 --> 00:50:45,000
everyone's pockets before we got started?

829
00:50:45,584 --> 00:50:48,670
He looks totally normal.
How could he try to trick us like that?

830
00:50:49,004 --> 00:50:50,505
How embarrassing.

831
00:50:51,006 --> 00:50:54,009
You guys will need to watch
what you say in front of him.

832
00:50:54,092 --> 00:50:55,385
He looks like a bigmouth.

833
00:50:55,469 --> 00:50:57,095
He's not my cup of tea.

834
00:50:58,513 --> 00:51:00,348
-Good shot!
-Great.

835
00:51:00,599 --> 00:51:03,101
How about we talk honestly
since none of us is a bigmouth?

836
00:51:04,019 --> 00:51:05,353
You have another woman, don't you?

837
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:07,481
Gosh, of course.

838
00:51:07,981 --> 00:51:10,650
What about you?
You must have a mistress too.

839
00:51:12,402 --> 00:51:13,820
I don't want to say, "Of course,"

840
00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:15,739
but I do have one too.

841
00:51:16,573 --> 00:51:17,824
Only losers don't have one.

842
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:21,036
There are two types of outcasts.

843
00:51:24,456 --> 00:51:26,666
Those who don't care
as long as they don't know about it

844
00:51:27,709 --> 00:51:30,128
and those who have to tussle with others
to prove themselves.

845
00:51:30,253 --> 00:51:31,254
Ms. Jo.

846
00:51:35,175 --> 00:51:36,259
Ms. Park.

847
00:51:37,302 --> 00:51:39,221
You haven't heard about it from A-jin yet?

848
00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:42,599
What about, ma'am?

849
00:51:43,975 --> 00:51:46,436
I slept like a baby
thanks to the new blanket.

850
00:51:46,770 --> 00:51:47,729
Mr. Chairman.

851
00:51:48,271 --> 00:51:49,815
Did you have a good sleep?

852
00:51:51,066 --> 00:51:52,901
Give me breakfast. I want rice.

853
00:51:53,068 --> 00:51:53,944
Yes, sir.

854
00:51:55,529 --> 00:51:56,530
Ms. Jo.

855
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:58,406
From now on,

856
00:51:58,698 --> 00:52:01,034
I'll prepare Mr. Chairman's meals.

857
00:52:01,326 --> 00:52:02,869
I'll take care of his laundry too.

858
00:52:02,953 --> 00:52:06,706
We should get a new fabric softener
with a different scent.

859
00:52:07,791 --> 00:52:09,626
I'll hand-wash his clothes.

860
00:52:09,709 --> 00:52:10,669
Ms. Park!

861
00:52:11,294 --> 00:52:12,504
Hand-washing is a lot of work.

862
00:52:18,844 --> 00:52:21,513
You're a good judge of character

863
00:52:22,472 --> 00:52:24,099
even though you made a mistake
with Jae-seok.

864
00:52:29,813 --> 00:52:32,691
The scope of the things
that an outcast can do

865
00:52:33,108 --> 00:52:34,860
becomes narrow each day.

866
00:52:42,284 --> 00:52:45,871
One of the reasons I became fond of her

867
00:52:46,705 --> 00:52:50,500
was the fact
that she doesn't have the malice

868
00:52:51,001 --> 00:52:53,003
that I see in most rich people.

869
00:52:58,341 --> 00:53:02,053
The grace that enables her
to offer a hand to a devastated outcast.

870
00:53:03,805 --> 00:53:07,142
That was the reason why I thought

871
00:53:07,309 --> 00:53:08,351
that she was special.

872
00:53:21,656 --> 00:53:25,368
FACULTY OF HUMANITIES

873
00:53:32,417 --> 00:53:35,128
Father, please forgive him just this once.

874
00:53:35,378 --> 00:53:38,465
It was a mistake.
Jae-gu is not that kind of person.

875
00:53:38,715 --> 00:53:41,760
I don't want to hear it.
I'll disown him as of this moment.

876
00:53:44,262 --> 00:53:46,556
He betrayed me
in order to eat up my company.

877
00:53:46,723 --> 00:53:48,767
How dare he kill a person whom I hired?

878
00:53:48,934 --> 00:53:50,477
It means he's capable
of killing me as well.

879
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:53,688
No, Father. Please don't get
the wrong idea. It was just an accident.

880
00:53:53,772 --> 00:53:56,900
Anyway, I'll take care of Un-gyu,

881
00:53:57,400 --> 00:53:59,110
but I've already decided
to cut ties with Jae-gu.

882
00:54:01,112 --> 00:54:03,406
Let A-jin take care of everything
in this household from now on.

883
00:54:04,157 --> 00:54:06,701
I won't give you any financial support.

884
00:54:06,785 --> 00:54:10,288
If I do, my money will obviously
go to that punk.

885
00:54:10,914 --> 00:54:12,624
Father...

886
00:54:29,474 --> 00:54:32,018
So? Will you keep that caregiver?

887
00:54:32,268 --> 00:54:33,353
I should. What else can I do?

888
00:54:39,234 --> 00:54:40,485
She's Pungsan CEO's mistress.

889
00:54:40,735 --> 00:54:43,905
She's gorgeous. Why is she living
as a mistress, not as his wife?

890
00:54:45,824 --> 00:54:47,200
I can understand men.

891
00:54:47,367 --> 00:54:50,787
Even I'd want to be with young,
fresh-faced women like her.

892
00:54:52,831 --> 00:54:55,166
Gi-ok, I bought 10kg
of cherries yesterday.

893
00:54:55,250 --> 00:54:56,209
Do you want some?

894
00:54:56,334 --> 00:54:57,919
It's okay. I still have some too.

895
00:55:09,264 --> 00:55:10,557
Hello, delivery for you.

896
00:55:11,016 --> 00:55:13,059
-Okay.
-Enjoy your food.

897
00:55:47,886 --> 00:55:50,680
I wasn't able to find a tart
that's as sweet

898
00:55:51,097 --> 00:55:52,849
as your smile.

899
00:55:53,850 --> 00:55:54,768
From Jae-seok Ahn.

900
00:56:00,982 --> 00:56:02,400
Pork belly and soju.

901
00:56:03,026 --> 00:56:04,235
Fried chicken and beer.

902
00:56:04,986 --> 00:56:06,321
Burger and cola.

903
00:56:07,614 --> 00:56:11,034
Every kind of food that exists
has the most ideal pairing.

904
00:56:18,333 --> 00:56:21,503
And there's one thing
that beats the pleasure

905
00:56:21,586 --> 00:56:24,506
given by the sweetest food
in the whole world.

906
00:56:53,326 --> 00:56:54,369
It's sweet, isn't it?

907
00:56:55,328 --> 00:56:56,371
It's really sweet.

908
00:56:56,913 --> 00:56:58,248
I couldn't resist it.

909
00:56:59,958 --> 00:57:02,544
EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR JAE-SEOK AHN

910
00:57:02,627 --> 00:57:03,461
I see.

911
00:57:04,671 --> 00:57:05,547
My gosh.

912
00:57:31,406 --> 00:57:32,490
Hello, Ms. Baek.

913
00:57:32,782 --> 00:57:33,825
Hey, A-jin.

914
00:57:34,033 --> 00:57:37,495
There's good news and even better news.
Which one do you want to hear first?

915
00:57:38,663 --> 00:57:39,581
Good news.

916
00:57:39,998 --> 00:57:42,709
I heard that a hot guy will come
to our meditation class tomorrow.

917
00:57:43,251 --> 00:57:44,419
We can all pair up now.

918
00:57:44,794 --> 00:57:47,755
That's great.
Now, I want to hear the better news.

919
00:57:49,466 --> 00:57:53,052
Ji-hu is the only one
who got perfect score

920
00:57:53,428 --> 00:57:55,221
on the math competition.

921
00:57:57,640 --> 00:57:58,600
Really?

922
00:57:59,267 --> 00:58:00,351
Really?

923
00:58:02,353 --> 00:58:05,023
Ms. Baek, you're being serious, right?
My goodness.

924
00:58:05,482 --> 00:58:08,443
The association that organized it
wants to take a picture of you and Ji-hu.

925
00:58:08,735 --> 00:58:09,944
I can say yes to them, right?

926
00:58:10,153 --> 00:58:11,112
Ms. Baek.

927
00:58:12,697 --> 00:58:15,617
I'm really happy right now.

928
00:58:18,870 --> 00:58:20,205
I'm too excited at the moment.

929
00:58:21,206 --> 00:58:22,790
I'll call you again in a bit.

930
00:58:23,875 --> 00:58:24,709
Okay.

931
00:58:27,003 --> 00:58:29,005
The sweetness she was
thoroughly enjoying at that moment

932
00:58:29,339 --> 00:58:31,633
could've been a gift from God.

933
00:58:32,008 --> 00:58:34,219
But the conclusion I've come to

934
00:58:35,011 --> 00:58:38,097
is the fact that God always bestows
such a gift on us

935
00:58:38,181 --> 00:58:40,767
before he gives us
extreme pain and suffering.

936
00:58:42,685 --> 00:58:46,272
He can be so mean at times.

937
00:59:06,251 --> 00:59:07,794
-Ms. Park.
-Yes.

938
00:59:08,002 --> 00:59:08,920
Bok-ja.

939
00:59:09,337 --> 00:59:10,922
Know your place, Bok-ja Park.

940
00:59:11,005 --> 00:59:13,841
You're just a maid here.
My father-in-law's caregiver.

941
00:59:13,925 --> 00:59:14,801
I have to fire her.

942
00:59:15,301 --> 00:59:18,179
I have no choice because
Ju-mi absolutely can't stand her.

943
00:59:18,263 --> 00:59:21,683
A-jin is actually more simple-minded
than you think. I bet she has no idea.

944
00:59:21,766 --> 00:59:24,519
I'll make sure she never finds out.
Just trust me.

945
00:59:24,602 --> 00:59:27,272
We have a new member
who is joining us starting today.

946
00:59:27,355 --> 00:59:29,566
-Meet Lawyer Gi-ho Kang.
-You're pretty.

947
00:59:29,691 --> 00:59:32,151
-Father, she is...
-Sir.

948
00:59:32,527 --> 00:59:33,987
Please do as Ju-mi says.

949
00:59:34,112 --> 00:59:35,905
She still is the lady of the house.

950
00:59:35,989 --> 00:59:37,490
Even I don't own a high-end designer bag.

951
00:59:37,574 --> 00:59:39,576
Why should a caregiver have one?

952
00:59:39,659 --> 00:59:40,493
Don't

953
00:59:41,744 --> 00:59:42,996
provoke me, please.

954
00:59:43,079 --> 00:59:44,330
If you don't behave yourself,

955
00:59:44,414 --> 00:59:45,748
you'll get kicked out.

956
00:59:45,873 --> 00:59:47,875
