1
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:43,918
-Right this way.
-Thank you.

2
00:00:44,043 --> 00:00:45,336
Yes, thank you.

3
00:00:47,714 --> 00:00:49,924
-You're here? Right this way.
-Hi.

4
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:51,885
Right here.

5
00:00:53,011 --> 00:00:54,888
CHARITY SALE

6
00:00:57,015 --> 00:00:58,767
-Gi-ok!
-Hey!

7
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:00,977
-Hello.
-Hello.

8
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:04,606
Put those flowers down here.

9
00:01:05,482 --> 00:01:06,816
The boxes should be here.

10
00:01:09,986 --> 00:01:12,405
A-jin, it's about to start.
Please come in.

11
00:01:12,655 --> 00:01:13,990
Sure, I'm almost finished.

12
00:01:14,783 --> 00:01:16,910
Please start delivering these in one hour.

13
00:01:16,993 --> 00:01:19,788
Put a bottle of champagne
and a plate of canapÃ© on each table.

14
00:01:19,871 --> 00:01:21,164
Sure, ma'am.

15
00:01:47,023 --> 00:01:49,192
There is a transparent glass ceiling

16
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:51,319
between the upper class
and the lower class.

17
00:01:51,861 --> 00:01:55,657
You may think that you can go beyond the
ceiling because you can clearly see it,

18
00:01:56,074 --> 00:02:00,370
but the truth is, the glamorous world
is blocked by an impenetrable glass.

19
00:02:01,287 --> 00:02:02,622
I'm certain that no one

20
00:02:02,705 --> 00:02:05,625
from the upper class can step into
what's beneath the glass ceiling.

21
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:09,254
That's because of the glass floor
they're standing on.

22
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:13,758
The transparent but firm glass,
inevitably keeping the lower class

23
00:02:13,842 --> 00:02:14,968
separated from the upper class.

24
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:26,771
However, there's something
that they've forgotten.

25
00:02:28,189 --> 00:02:31,234
Glass floors may be transparent,

26
00:02:31,693 --> 00:02:33,570
but they can be shattered.

27
00:02:37,907 --> 00:02:38,741
My gosh!

28
00:02:40,201 --> 00:02:42,996
That was made by an artist,
so it's one of a kind!

29
00:02:44,455 --> 00:02:47,208
Why do expensive things break so easily?

30
00:02:52,046 --> 00:02:54,090
I need to talk to you for a moment.

31
00:03:04,809 --> 00:03:06,311
What is it, Cho-hui?

32
00:03:08,771 --> 00:03:12,901
Don't call me by that name ever again.

33
00:03:13,568 --> 00:03:15,695
I'm sorry. It became a habit.

34
00:03:15,778 --> 00:03:18,907
I'm not Cho-hui Park anymore.

35
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:21,326
I'm the madam of Daesung Pulp.

36
00:03:22,076 --> 00:03:25,455
Let me warn you again.
Be careful in front of other people.

37
00:03:26,748 --> 00:03:29,834
I trust you. You know that, right?

38
00:03:30,668 --> 00:03:32,253
Of course, I know that.

39
00:03:32,462 --> 00:03:34,714
I understand what you're saying.
Don't worry.

40
00:03:34,797 --> 00:03:37,342
Just do your job perfectly.

41
00:03:37,425 --> 00:03:40,887
If you do that,
I will compensate you well.

42
00:03:41,179 --> 00:03:43,723
I got it. I'll become your eyes and ears

43
00:03:43,806 --> 00:03:45,558
as you want.

44
00:04:48,037 --> 00:04:49,622
I have to buy that one.

45
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:53,001
My gosh!

46
00:04:53,084 --> 00:04:56,713
This is too big for me,
but I'm going to buy it!

47
00:04:56,879 --> 00:05:00,008
No one can put dibs on this one!
This one is mine!

48
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:03,428
This is why I like her!

49
00:05:03,845 --> 00:05:06,139
Did you hear that? She said it's big!

50
00:05:11,352 --> 00:05:13,187
Let me see how it looks on you.

51
00:05:14,397 --> 00:05:15,565
It's huge!

52
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:22,613
But why isn't she here yet?

53
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:38,379
Hello, Ms. Seo. I'm late. I apologize.

54
00:05:38,671 --> 00:05:40,715
I'll introduce you to everyone. Follow me.

55
00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:49,390
-This is our rookie artist.
-Hello.

56
00:05:49,557 --> 00:05:51,142
EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR JAE-SEOK AHN

57
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:06,324
The marketing team's campaign to give
free sanity pads to low-income families...

58
00:06:08,284 --> 00:06:10,828
Sir, are you worried about something?

59
00:06:11,621 --> 00:06:13,414
You're definitely my sun.

60
00:06:14,665 --> 00:06:18,252
The earth needs a sun,
but it needs a moon, too.

61
00:06:18,628 --> 00:06:20,463
The sun comes out during the day

62
00:06:21,964 --> 00:06:23,716
and the moon comes out at night.

63
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:27,762
Imagine if we only had a sun.

64
00:06:30,515 --> 00:06:31,891
We wouldn't be able to live with that.

65
00:06:31,974 --> 00:06:34,769
Wait, why are you worrying
about such a thing?

66
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:40,566
You seriously lack romance, Mr. Park.

67
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:43,611
You're very lucky
to be such a romanticist.

68
00:06:48,032 --> 00:06:49,450
Payment documents.

69
00:06:54,622 --> 00:06:55,915
-I'll see you later.
-Sure.

70
00:06:55,998 --> 00:06:57,208
-Good work today.
-Thank you.

71
00:07:19,647 --> 00:07:20,815
Did you buy anything?

72
00:07:20,898 --> 00:07:22,942
I bought a decorative piece
made of Thai elephant enamel

73
00:07:23,025 --> 00:07:25,111
and a wallet that Ms. Jung
of Sungwoo Group put up for sale.

74
00:07:25,236 --> 00:07:26,529
How much I donated is a secret.

75
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:30,074
By the way, have you heard?

76
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:34,454
Bong-sik was attacked in a parking lot
and got severely hurt.

77
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:36,289
Gosh, really?

78
00:07:36,664 --> 00:07:37,498
Yes.

79
00:07:38,207 --> 00:07:40,626
What do we do?
We live in a dangerous world.

80
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:41,752
How could that happen?

81
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:44,505
He was beaten to the brink of death.

82
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:48,009
You sound sad that he didn't actually die.

83
00:07:49,218 --> 00:07:52,221
It's not like I live with my husband
out of affection.

84
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:54,348
You don't have to pretend
when it's just the two of us.

85
00:07:55,349 --> 00:07:57,310
I'm glad I have a comrade.

86
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:58,436
Let's drink to that.

87
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:05,651
-Why won't you divorce him?
-How would I feed myself if I do?

88
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:09,113
That's a universal and simple reason.

89
00:08:09,197 --> 00:08:10,323
Why won't you get a divorce?

90
00:08:10,656 --> 00:08:11,782
It's because of the kids.

91
00:08:11,866 --> 00:08:14,452
That's a humane and understandable reason.

92
00:08:15,077 --> 00:08:17,163
-Get a boyfriend.
-I have one already.

93
00:08:17,413 --> 00:08:18,456
Really?

94
00:08:19,415 --> 00:08:21,209
Do you think you're the only one
with a boyfriend?

95
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:24,837
He broke four ribs

96
00:08:24,962 --> 00:08:27,632
and those broken ribs
caused a lung injury.

97
00:08:28,549 --> 00:08:30,801
They said it was pretty much
an attempted murder.

98
00:08:31,594 --> 00:08:33,721
Do you know the director
of that plastic surgery clinic?

99
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:35,765
The doctor that Gyeong-hui is seeing.

100
00:08:36,098 --> 00:08:37,308
Do you think it was him?

101
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:39,602
Hey, no way! Why would that doctor

102
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:41,729
hit that woman's husband?

103
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:45,942
I heard that golfer hits his wife a lot.

104
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:47,235
Why does she let him hit her?

105
00:08:47,735 --> 00:08:51,030
His wife can't have children.
I heard she's infertile.

106
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:54,408
Is that why she treats Yun-jae so well?

107
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:58,538
I guess she's giving him affection
because she can't have kids of her own.

108
00:08:59,497 --> 00:09:00,456
I feel bad for her.

109
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:03,376
She's got a pretty face,
she should just find a better man.

110
00:09:03,459 --> 00:09:06,212
But doesn't Dr. Jang's wife know?

111
00:09:06,712 --> 00:09:09,048
I'm pretty sure everyone knows
that her husband

112
00:09:09,131 --> 00:09:10,550
is cheating on her.

113
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:13,594
Dr. Jang's family aren't members
of the Pung-suk's Kitchen.

114
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:16,430
That's why she has
no sources to hear this from.

115
00:09:16,514 --> 00:09:18,015
By the way, have you heard?

116
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:21,269
Chairman Ahn's house hired a new maid.

117
00:09:21,811 --> 00:09:23,396
Apparently, his new wife hired her.

118
00:09:23,479 --> 00:09:25,982
You're having an easy time calling
Bok-ja his new wife.

119
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:28,568
Anyway, you're the best
at adjusting to new situations.

120
00:09:29,944 --> 00:09:31,862
The gossips from Pung-suk's Kitchen are

121
00:09:32,154 --> 00:09:34,490
the fastest and the most precise ones.

122
00:09:35,157 --> 00:09:37,910
However, thanks to the secretive cook,

123
00:09:38,119 --> 00:09:39,954
no one found out about Jae-seok's affair

124
00:09:40,037 --> 00:09:42,832
even in Pung-suk's Kitchen.

125
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:48,379
And there was another secret

126
00:09:48,462 --> 00:09:52,091
that the ladies of Pung-suk's Kitchen
didn't realize.

127
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:24,165
Dad, are you going to do
whatever that woman wants?

128
00:10:24,415 --> 00:10:27,001
"That woman"? You punk.

129
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:28,502
Watch your mouth.

130
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:31,339
You're talking as if you're uneducated.

131
00:10:31,422 --> 00:10:34,842
Dad, if you spoil her,
she'll develop bad habits.

132
00:10:34,925 --> 00:10:37,720
I know that all too well.
That's what happened to you.

133
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:40,181
I really hate the new maid, too.

134
00:10:40,556 --> 00:10:43,184
Why do you care?
You're going to go home soon.

135
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:45,978
I'm your daughter!
I have the right to butt in!

136
00:10:46,062 --> 00:10:47,563
That's enough! I'll do whatever I want!

137
00:10:47,938 --> 00:10:50,149
You better not give her
any financial rights.

138
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:53,027
Why are you interfering? Go home.

139
00:10:53,194 --> 00:10:55,154
I won't. No, I can't.

140
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:58,908
Give me two billion won.
Then I'll back down for now.

141
00:10:59,408 --> 00:11:00,409
Just for now.

142
00:11:01,035 --> 00:11:03,788
-That means I'll go home.
-Get lost.

143
00:11:04,413 --> 00:11:06,207
I don't want to see any of my kids.

144
00:11:09,251 --> 00:11:10,378
You always tell me to get lost.

145
00:11:15,966 --> 00:11:16,884
"Get lost."

146
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:18,844
Where am I supposed to go?
I have nowhere to go.

147
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:20,971
It's a snake...

148
00:11:21,847 --> 00:11:23,015
Jae-hui, do you want food?

149
00:11:23,432 --> 00:11:25,142
What? "Jae-hui"?

150
00:11:26,852 --> 00:11:29,563
Ma'am, is this your first time
working for someone else's house?

151
00:11:30,064 --> 00:11:32,650
I was self-employed. This is my
first time doing this kind of job.

152
00:11:33,275 --> 00:11:34,652
I'm speechless.

153
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:36,737
You should know your place.

154
00:11:36,987 --> 00:11:38,155
Don't you watch the television?

155
00:11:38,572 --> 00:11:41,325
As my worker,
did you just call me "Jae-hui"?

156
00:11:41,826 --> 00:11:43,035
You must be crazy.

157
00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:45,121
Then what should I call you?

158
00:11:45,788 --> 00:11:47,456
You can call me "Ms. Ahn"!

159
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,792
You're too old to be a Miss.

160
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:50,960
Ma'am!

161
00:11:51,794 --> 00:11:53,379
If you don't want to be
kicked out, shut up!

162
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:56,048
Okay, I'll shut up.

163
00:11:57,258 --> 00:11:58,217
Do you want food?

164
00:12:03,764 --> 00:12:04,932
He told me

165
00:12:05,266 --> 00:12:08,436
that you paid him to hurt Bok-ja Park.

166
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:10,104
That's nonsense.

167
00:12:11,063 --> 00:12:12,231
Let's meet that man right away.

168
00:12:12,731 --> 00:12:14,275
No, report him to the police.

169
00:12:14,692 --> 00:12:15,901
I'll lock him up in jail.

170
00:12:19,029 --> 00:12:20,698
Are you doubting me, too?

171
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:24,076
Truth be told, you have the motive.

172
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:25,828
You hated her a lot.

173
00:12:26,036 --> 00:12:28,664
If I were going to instigate
such a thing using a middleman,

174
00:12:29,874 --> 00:12:31,792
I would have told him to kill her instead.

175
00:12:33,836 --> 00:12:36,130
Report him to the police, okay?
You better do it.

176
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:37,798
Never mind. I'll do it.

177
00:12:39,049 --> 00:12:40,384
What are you going to report him for?

178
00:12:40,468 --> 00:12:42,011
And what if you do?

179
00:12:42,344 --> 00:12:46,056
If he accuses you of instigating it,
will you have a way out?

180
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:49,059
Why would I need a way out
of something I didn't do?

181
00:12:49,143 --> 00:12:51,979
And if I paid him to do that,
there would be a receipt

182
00:12:52,062 --> 00:12:53,022
or a transaction record.

183
00:12:53,105 --> 00:12:55,191
He said you used cash
so no record would remain.

184
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:56,192
What?

185
00:12:57,067 --> 00:12:58,694
I want to see this man myself.

186
00:12:58,986 --> 00:12:59,820
No.

187
00:13:00,321 --> 00:13:01,280
Report him.

188
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:06,243
No good will come out of having
the police at your house.

189
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:08,120
You shouldn't report this
to the police, Ju-mi.

190
00:13:08,496 --> 00:13:11,248
I have a feeling that this was her doing.

191
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:15,628
I couldn't even eat properly

192
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:17,588
ever since she entered our home.

193
00:13:20,007 --> 00:13:21,675
What are you going to do about Jae-gu?

194
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:24,345
What could I do? We've been strangers
for a long time now.

195
00:13:24,512 --> 00:13:26,013
Let him come back home for the time being.

196
00:13:26,096 --> 00:13:28,849
I'm not the one stopping him.
He dug his own grave.

197
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:32,603
I'm disgusted. He's the one
who put me in this misery.

198
00:13:32,686 --> 00:13:35,397
I'll call him, so keep that in mind.

199
00:13:35,773 --> 00:13:37,149
What are you going to say?

200
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:38,984
I should tell him to come back home.

201
00:13:39,527 --> 00:13:42,238
I'll let you take care of that yourself.

202
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:45,407
But, he can't enter my room.

203
00:13:47,451 --> 00:13:49,328
Oh, sure. I got it.

204
00:13:49,912 --> 00:13:51,914
I cleaned out the room
on the second floor for him.

205
00:14:29,076 --> 00:14:30,035
Hello?

206
00:14:31,328 --> 00:14:33,789
A-jin. What is it?

207
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:37,042
Of course, I want to go back home.

208
00:14:38,419 --> 00:14:40,379
Okay, I'm hanging up now, Jae-gu.

209
00:14:45,426 --> 00:14:47,595
Oh. One moment, please.

210
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:53,559
A-jin, they said that the trainer quit
a few days ago.

211
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:56,103
-Text me his number.
-Okay, A-jin.

212
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:58,856
She eats six meals a day

213
00:14:59,356 --> 00:15:01,150
and finishes a large pizza by herself.

214
00:15:01,525 --> 00:15:02,568
My point is,

215
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:04,945
I don't see my wife as a woman,
but an elephant.

216
00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:06,447
I don't feel sexually attracted to her.

217
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:11,660
Have you ever thought of looking into

218
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:14,705
why your wife goes on a binge?

219
00:15:15,623 --> 00:15:17,875
Your wife isn't there just to satisfy
your sexual appetite.

220
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:20,002
As a fellow man,
you're not understanding me.

221
00:15:20,836 --> 00:15:24,006
If it were you, would you sleep with
an elephant-sized woman?

222
00:15:30,137 --> 00:15:31,472
Yes, I got it.

223
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:39,063
You are Mr. Kang's partner
who called earlier, aren't you?

224
00:15:39,146 --> 00:15:40,022
Yes.

225
00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:41,982
He's in the middle of a consultation.

226
00:15:43,192 --> 00:15:44,318
I feel so frustrated.

227
00:15:45,152 --> 00:15:47,655
-Are you leaving?
-I told him that

228
00:15:47,738 --> 00:15:50,157
I'll pay him big money
if he helps me win the divorce lawsuit.

229
00:15:51,241 --> 00:15:52,576
And he says, "Love your wife"?

230
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:55,287
He needs to go out of business
to come to his senses.

231
00:15:56,497 --> 00:16:00,125
Mr. Kang sometimes
goes overboard with his clients.

232
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:02,753
He talks as if he's Confucius
day in and day out.

233
00:16:04,713 --> 00:16:06,882
I notarized your father's
prenuptial agreement.

234
00:16:07,091 --> 00:16:08,092
Keep it safe.

235
00:16:08,175 --> 00:16:09,009
Thank you.

236
00:16:09,426 --> 00:16:11,011
-Would you like some tea?
-No.

237
00:16:11,136 --> 00:16:13,514
I asked your office manager
about your schedule before coming here.

238
00:16:13,597 --> 00:16:15,432
She said you have to be
in court at three o'clock.

239
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:18,477
That's too bad.

240
00:16:21,605 --> 00:16:22,940
But, partner.

241
00:16:23,774 --> 00:16:25,192
You seem to be in a good mood today.

242
00:16:26,443 --> 00:16:27,361
Really?

243
00:16:34,034 --> 00:16:35,160
LOVE OR HURT MAKES ME BLOOM

244
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:36,745
There was a charity event.

245
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:40,290
This was a precious donation
from Ms. Baek,

246
00:16:40,374 --> 00:16:42,334
but no one bought it.

247
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:46,005
This book of poetry
was the only item that remained

248
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:49,341
as if it was a single flower
in the middle of a battlefield.

249
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:53,178
It seemed like fate.
I was strangely drawn to it.

250
00:16:54,805 --> 00:16:55,889
You're not saying

251
00:16:56,181 --> 00:16:59,685
you're giving this to me, are you?

252
00:17:00,144 --> 00:17:02,771
I am. I'm thankful to you in many ways.

253
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:13,699
"Endure the rest of your life
with this love."

254
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:16,535
I really liked that passage, too.

255
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:20,622
The art is amazing, too.

256
00:17:21,582 --> 00:17:24,084
Why are you giving me this precious book?

257
00:17:24,585 --> 00:17:25,627
You're my partner.

258
00:17:26,003 --> 00:17:27,921
Please read that and comfort me.

259
00:17:28,422 --> 00:17:31,383
I wanted to give you a priceless gift.

260
00:17:34,344 --> 00:17:36,346
I'll do that. Thank you.

261
00:17:37,222 --> 00:17:39,016
I'll get going. Please continue
what you were doing.

262
00:17:39,433 --> 00:17:40,559
Wait, A-jin.

263
00:17:43,187 --> 00:17:45,773
"If the sun shines through the clouds,

264
00:17:46,023 --> 00:17:48,275
that sun becomes one with you."

265
00:17:52,029 --> 00:17:54,031
That's another line
from this book of poetry.

266
00:17:57,618 --> 00:18:01,205
"If the sun shines through the clouds,

267
00:18:01,455 --> 00:18:03,749
that sun becomes one with you."

268
00:18:05,542 --> 00:18:06,376
I like that.

269
00:18:07,544 --> 00:18:08,962
Maybe I should have kept that book.

270
00:18:21,558 --> 00:18:23,185
What brings you here, Madam?

271
00:18:28,357 --> 00:18:31,485
My daughter-in-law said
she put in a word for me.

272
00:18:31,693 --> 00:18:33,237
What's your daughter-in-law's name?

273
00:18:34,863 --> 00:18:36,532
A-jin Woo.

274
00:18:38,826 --> 00:18:40,077
Yes, Madam.

275
00:18:40,369 --> 00:18:42,371
Your admission procedure
has been completed.

276
00:18:45,332 --> 00:18:46,875
You may enter right away if you'd like.

277
00:18:47,251 --> 00:18:48,293
Thank you.

278
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:51,213
But, Madam.

279
00:18:52,005 --> 00:18:54,967
You were a frequent guest at our hotel
in the past, right?

280
00:18:55,759 --> 00:18:57,761
-Pardon?
-It's just that

281
00:18:57,928 --> 00:19:00,097
-I feel like I've met you before.
-No.

282
00:19:01,932 --> 00:19:03,100
This

283
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:05,352
is my first time here.

284
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:17,364
I've definitely seen her
many times before.

285
00:19:18,365 --> 00:19:19,658
Where have I seen her?

286
00:19:56,695 --> 00:19:58,697
Then, is he not answering at all?

287
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:01,450
It says the number doesn't exist.

288
00:20:02,618 --> 00:20:04,119
This is weird.

289
00:20:04,745 --> 00:20:07,956
A-jin, do you think
Ju-mi told him to do it, or...

290
00:20:08,165 --> 00:20:09,041
I don't know.

291
00:20:09,917 --> 00:20:12,169
Maybe I should have talked
to my partner about this.

292
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:13,921
-Your partner?
-Yes.

293
00:20:14,129 --> 00:20:15,964
The partner who helps me
with mind counseling.

294
00:20:18,091 --> 00:20:20,385
A-jin, Ji-hu's violin teacher said

295
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:23,472
she'd call you about entering her
in a competition.

296
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:26,391
Is my daughter talented
at playing the violin, too?

297
00:20:26,767 --> 00:20:28,060
I know, right?

298
00:20:28,352 --> 00:20:29,770
What will we do with her?

299
00:20:29,853 --> 00:20:31,480
Let's look for something
she's not good at.

300
00:20:34,983 --> 00:20:37,527
A-jin, are things okay with Jae-seok?

301
00:20:40,322 --> 00:20:41,615
How could it be okay?

302
00:20:42,366 --> 00:20:43,825
It's hard to even look at his face.

303
00:20:44,534 --> 00:20:45,953
I'm only enduring it because of Ji-hu.

304
00:20:46,787 --> 00:20:49,998
I endure it for Ji-hu by thinking
about the things he's done

305
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:53,710
that I was thankful for

306
00:20:54,836 --> 00:20:56,380
five times a day.

307
00:20:57,923 --> 00:20:59,508
Is he working right now?

308
00:21:01,009 --> 00:21:02,010
Probably?

309
00:22:07,743 --> 00:22:10,746
Seong-hui.

310
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:14,416
What the heck?

311
00:22:15,208 --> 00:22:16,710
Who is right then?

312
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:19,755
Jae-hui, what are you talking about?

313
00:22:20,464 --> 00:22:23,050
Am I crazy enough to make him do
such a crazy thing?

314
00:22:23,133 --> 00:22:24,468
I don't even know him very well.

315
00:22:24,551 --> 00:22:27,721
He disappeared, though. Weren't you
the one who told him to do that, too?

316
00:22:27,804 --> 00:22:30,015
-Jae-hui!
-That's okay. I understand you.

317
00:22:30,098 --> 00:22:32,559
-I said it wasn't me!
-Is Jae-gu coming home?

318
00:22:32,642 --> 00:22:33,935
Yes, he's on his way.

319
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:35,562
That's good. We have to unite.

320
00:22:36,813 --> 00:22:39,816
They really get on my nerves.

321
00:22:40,108 --> 00:22:41,526
What should we do, Madam?

322
00:22:43,361 --> 00:22:44,821
Get rid of them one by one.

323
00:22:45,655 --> 00:22:49,493
You can start with that childish wench
over there.

324
00:22:49,826 --> 00:22:50,827
What are you doing?

325
00:22:53,663 --> 00:22:55,540
-It's nothing.
-Please get some rest.

326
00:22:58,585 --> 00:23:01,171
I don't know where this woman
rolled in from,

327
00:23:01,671 --> 00:23:04,049
but her body reeks of cigarettes.

328
00:23:05,383 --> 00:23:06,635
What will A-jin do?

329
00:23:07,094 --> 00:23:09,221
I'm pretty sure she wants to die as it is.

330
00:23:09,429 --> 00:23:11,890
Why? Did something happen to her?

331
00:23:13,433 --> 00:23:15,393
-I know about it, too.
-What is it?

332
00:23:15,477 --> 00:23:17,062
Why are you leaving me out?

333
00:23:21,566 --> 00:23:24,111
Mr. Chairman, why don't you
clear out a room,

334
00:23:24,194 --> 00:23:26,613
put a karaoke machine in there

335
00:23:26,905 --> 00:23:28,782
and install...

336
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:30,492
What is it called?

337
00:23:30,575 --> 00:23:33,537
A home theatre? Install that, too.

338
00:23:33,787 --> 00:23:37,415
All the rich people on television
live like that.

339
00:23:38,583 --> 00:23:39,960
Is that what you wanted to do?

340
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:43,964
Gosh, I'm just thinking of you.

341
00:23:44,297 --> 00:23:48,176
Your heart needs to be healthy
for your body to be healthy, too.

342
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:55,684
Why are you so late?

343
00:23:56,977 --> 00:23:58,311
I was just working.

344
00:24:00,814 --> 00:24:01,857
I'm telling the truth.

345
00:24:02,023 --> 00:24:03,441
Come here and sit down for a moment.

346
00:24:04,818 --> 00:24:05,694
Okay.

347
00:24:10,782 --> 00:24:14,119
I'll half-heartedly tolerate you
and live with no expectations.

348
00:24:15,078 --> 00:24:16,997
I'm going to endure it for Ji-hu's sake.

349
00:24:17,164 --> 00:24:18,456
This is for Ji-hu.

350
00:24:19,082 --> 00:24:20,292
I'm thankful for that.

351
00:24:20,375 --> 00:24:22,210
In return, you must leave
and come home on time

352
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:24,421
and I'm going to track your phone.

353
00:24:24,546 --> 00:24:25,547
Are you the NIS?

354
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:28,258
Don't joke around with me!
I don't want to hear it!

355
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:31,386
And from now on, sleep in the guest room.

356
00:24:31,469 --> 00:24:33,722
A normal couple lifestyle
is impossible for us now.

357
00:24:35,098 --> 00:24:37,142
If you're going to kick me out,
kick me out of the house.

358
00:24:38,351 --> 00:24:40,395
The maid already cleaned it up for you,

359
00:24:41,021 --> 00:24:41,897
so go to bed.

360
00:24:42,355 --> 00:24:43,190
Okay.

361
00:25:16,389 --> 00:25:17,265
My gosh!

362
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:48,421
You're so lame.

363
00:25:48,713 --> 00:25:50,548
Why are you texting me in the same house?

364
00:25:50,632 --> 00:25:51,675
It's fun.

365
00:25:51,967 --> 00:25:54,719
Jeong-hyeon texts me from her room
from time to time.

366
00:26:02,352 --> 00:26:03,687
Make me a cup of rice punch.

367
00:26:08,984 --> 00:26:11,528
Are you saying you've never met
this person before?

368
00:26:12,570 --> 00:26:13,446
Yes.

369
00:26:13,613 --> 00:26:16,241
You know that your wife was assaulted
by the same person, right?

370
00:26:18,326 --> 00:26:19,411
Didn't you know?

371
00:26:20,287 --> 00:26:22,455
You saw the injuries
on her face and body, right?

372
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:24,207
Is...

373
00:26:24,291 --> 00:26:25,709
Is that what she said?

374
00:26:26,084 --> 00:26:27,294
That it was the same culprit?

375
00:26:27,377 --> 00:26:29,170
Yes, that's what she thinks.

376
00:26:29,379 --> 00:26:30,880
His features and clothes
were similar, too.

377
00:26:43,643 --> 00:26:44,728
Get out.

378
00:26:46,354 --> 00:26:48,064
-What?
-I told you to get out.

379
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:51,735
I'm going to make your room
into a karaoke and movie room.

380
00:26:52,485 --> 00:26:54,195
-What?
-Mr. Chairman.

381
00:26:54,779 --> 00:26:57,949
People usually call that a multiplex room.

382
00:26:58,033 --> 00:27:00,910
-Really?
-Dad, I'm going to live here.

383
00:27:00,994 --> 00:27:02,537
Why would you live here?

384
00:27:03,038 --> 00:27:06,666
I already bought you a house
and a farm on Jejudo for you!

385
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:08,835
I told you my husband blew all of it.

386
00:27:09,127 --> 00:27:11,212
If I go to Jejudo,
I have to work as a diver.

387
00:27:11,296 --> 00:27:12,589
Then be a diver!

388
00:27:13,381 --> 00:27:16,426
Why are you doing this to me? Why just me?

389
00:27:16,509 --> 00:27:17,635
Try to be a decent human being!

390
00:27:17,969 --> 00:27:19,095
What's wrong with being a diver?

391
00:27:19,971 --> 00:27:21,514
What about the pickled vegetables?

392
00:27:21,806 --> 00:27:24,434
I'm going to pick it up
from Pung-suk's Kitchen today.

393
00:27:24,601 --> 00:27:26,603
Try this for now. Pepper leaves.

394
00:27:31,024 --> 00:27:34,736
Then when should we start remodeling
the guest room?

395
00:27:34,819 --> 00:27:37,280
Excuse me, what are you doing?

396
00:27:37,614 --> 00:27:41,117
Jae-hui, you're old enough now.

397
00:27:41,618 --> 00:27:42,994
Don't throw a tantrum.

398
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:45,413
What did you say?

399
00:27:48,375 --> 00:27:49,501
What are you doing?

400
00:27:51,086 --> 00:27:53,004
I've prepared Jae-gu's breakfast.

401
00:27:53,463 --> 00:27:54,381
Leave it!

402
00:27:54,756 --> 00:27:56,383
Why are you preparing his breakfast?

403
00:27:56,466 --> 00:27:57,967
Then who will?

404
00:27:58,843 --> 00:28:01,054
Isn't this what I'm here to do?

405
00:28:04,766 --> 00:28:07,352
Who on earth is the owner of this house?

406
00:28:07,435 --> 00:28:09,938
Your son can't eat at the table
and your daughter is getting kicked out!

407
00:28:10,397 --> 00:28:12,607
Dad, this doesn't make any sense.

408
00:28:12,690 --> 00:28:15,110
Does your head hurt, by any chance?

409
00:28:16,152 --> 00:28:18,321
I wouldn't be doing this
if I had decent children!

410
00:28:18,405 --> 00:28:21,408
The reason I'm sick is all because of you!

411
00:28:21,616 --> 00:28:23,493
Listen to you.

412
00:28:23,576 --> 00:28:27,414
If my headaches turn into dementia,
will you be happy?

413
00:28:29,416 --> 00:28:32,502
You're getting worked up again.
I told you not to do that.

414
00:28:34,212 --> 00:28:35,296
Jae-hui.

415
00:28:35,797 --> 00:28:40,301
I'd like it if you could refrain
from saying such provocative things.

416
00:28:41,052 --> 00:28:44,097
I'm begging you.

417
00:28:53,273 --> 00:28:54,566
It's time to eat.

418
00:28:55,734 --> 00:28:57,360
Don't bother me.

419
00:28:58,153 --> 00:28:59,988
You should eat something.

420
00:29:33,354 --> 00:29:36,191
Jae-hui, can't you switch rooms
with Jae-gu?

421
00:29:37,442 --> 00:29:40,653
Take the room on the second floor
and let Jae-gu sleep here.

422
00:29:41,196 --> 00:29:42,155
Ju-mi.

423
00:29:42,739 --> 00:29:45,575
Didn't you clearly hear what Dad
said to us this morning?

424
00:29:46,409 --> 00:29:49,537
He told me to empty this room
so he can do something else with it!

425
00:29:50,413 --> 00:29:52,165
Right, he said that.

426
00:29:52,248 --> 00:29:54,584
How can I get rid of that woman?

427
00:29:54,959 --> 00:29:58,755
Should I scrub the bathroom floor
with soap so she'll slip and die?

428
00:30:08,264 --> 00:30:11,309
Your glucose level
has significantly dropped.

429
00:30:14,437 --> 00:30:15,647
I'm so happy.

430
00:30:17,565 --> 00:30:20,109
-I'm so happy.
-It's all thanks to you, Ms. Park.

431
00:30:21,027 --> 00:30:23,947
But when will you stop
calling me "Ms. Park"?

432
00:30:26,115 --> 00:30:27,158
I know, right?

433
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:28,618
Then...

434
00:30:32,288 --> 00:30:33,248
My love.

435
00:30:35,792 --> 00:30:36,626
Yes.

436
00:30:38,169 --> 00:30:39,128
Honey.

437
00:30:50,223 --> 00:30:52,809
Change Mr. Chairman's blankets
with this one.

438
00:30:53,101 --> 00:30:55,770
And use this as the bedspread.

439
00:31:03,444 --> 00:31:05,154
Get rid of those plates.

440
00:31:05,697 --> 00:31:08,616
The late madam used to use those plates

441
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:11,786
so Ms. Woo purposely
stored them on the top shelf.

442
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:15,665
I didn't tell you to throw them away.
Just push them to the back.

443
00:31:16,541 --> 00:31:19,586
Don't talk back
and just do as you're told.

444
00:31:22,672 --> 00:31:23,548
By the way.

445
00:31:25,842 --> 00:31:28,469
Bang-soon is going to come
to Pung-suk's Kitchen from now on.

446
00:31:28,553 --> 00:31:30,346
Take her with you just for today.

447
00:31:30,763 --> 00:31:33,725
And go pick up the Korean ramp pickles
I ordered last time.

448
00:31:35,476 --> 00:31:36,853
Yes, Ms. Park.

449
00:31:42,942 --> 00:31:43,818
Who is she?

450
00:31:44,068 --> 00:31:45,653
The new maid. The crazy one.

451
00:31:48,072 --> 00:31:49,532
Here's your Korean ramp pickle.

452
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:51,284
Yes.

453
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:55,872
May I take a look around?

454
00:31:58,374 --> 00:31:59,208
Sure.

455
00:33:21,749 --> 00:33:24,043
The tarts were really sweet.

456
00:33:24,127 --> 00:33:25,545
Just like your dimples.

457
00:33:25,837 --> 00:33:28,589
I want you to fill my dimples.

458
00:33:29,298 --> 00:33:32,010
Mr. Yun changed the morning
soccer game to bike-riding.

459
00:33:32,093 --> 00:33:33,511
Oh my, how did that happen?

460
00:33:33,803 --> 00:33:37,348
I will never forget this morning.
I'll love you even more, tomorrow.

461
00:33:37,682 --> 00:33:39,809
I love you, too.

462
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:50,611
Seong-hui.

463
00:33:52,405 --> 00:33:54,323
Seong-hui.

464
00:33:55,783 --> 00:33:56,617
Our...

465
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:59,120
Our Seong-hui.

466
00:34:08,921 --> 00:34:10,923
Our Seong-hui.

467
00:34:11,174 --> 00:34:13,634
NAME, BIRTHDAY, PERMANENT ADDRESS,
RESIDENCE, PROFESSION

468
00:34:13,718 --> 00:34:15,970
Our mother's death anniversary
and our family members' birthdays.

469
00:34:16,304 --> 00:34:19,557
And our family takes care of
our uncle's death anniversary as well.

470
00:34:20,224 --> 00:34:22,435
There's a Buddhist temple
that Father built for our family.

471
00:34:22,643 --> 00:34:24,395
We hold our ancestral rites there.

472
00:34:24,645 --> 00:34:26,105
Mother's ancestral rites, too.

473
00:34:26,397 --> 00:34:28,775
You should take care of this from now on.

474
00:34:30,276 --> 00:34:31,319
I will.

475
00:34:32,528 --> 00:34:34,405
Thank you for cooperating with me.

476
00:34:34,572 --> 00:34:35,990
I might be overstepping my boundaries,

477
00:34:36,616 --> 00:34:38,326
but I have a favor to ask you.

478
00:34:39,035 --> 00:34:41,829
-Go ahead.
-Un-gyu is a third-year in high school.

479
00:34:43,331 --> 00:34:44,207
I know that.

480
00:34:44,415 --> 00:34:47,251
He's introverted and doesn't talk much
so he doesn't show it,

481
00:34:47,752 --> 00:34:49,003
but he's very hurt.

482
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:51,506
He misses and resents his father.

483
00:34:51,714 --> 00:34:54,425
He doesn't show any of his emotions.

484
00:34:55,051 --> 00:34:56,594
Please apologize to Un-gyu

485
00:34:58,554 --> 00:35:00,306
for the mistake you made the other day.

486
00:35:01,015 --> 00:35:02,308
If that's difficult,

487
00:35:03,518 --> 00:35:05,770
please say a few warm words
to him, at least.

488
00:35:08,648 --> 00:35:09,524
I'll do that.

489
00:35:11,275 --> 00:35:12,860
You're quite

490
00:35:14,445 --> 00:35:15,738
different

491
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:17,824
from other people.

492
00:35:25,998 --> 00:35:27,333
I beg you.

493
00:35:27,959 --> 00:35:30,086
Take care of Father and our family.

494
00:35:36,384 --> 00:35:38,719
That's right. Slowly.

495
00:35:38,803 --> 00:35:40,138
Slowly.

496
00:35:41,097 --> 00:35:44,350
Mr. Chairman, will you be able to go
for your exercise treatment today?

497
00:35:44,851 --> 00:35:47,562
No, I just got back from the hospital.

498
00:35:48,146 --> 00:35:49,564
I'm tired so I want to rest today.

499
00:35:50,523 --> 00:35:51,399
Okay.

500
00:35:51,941 --> 00:35:54,902
Then, can I borrow your car today?

501
00:35:55,611 --> 00:35:58,865
I want to go grocery shopping
so I can make you some food.

502
00:35:59,282 --> 00:36:00,658
You can use it whenever you want.

503
00:36:01,617 --> 00:36:03,619
Actually, just buy yourself a car.

504
00:36:05,329 --> 00:36:07,665
Can I do that?

505
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:08,916
Of course.

506
00:36:09,208 --> 00:36:11,127
Buy yourself a sturdy one.

507
00:36:16,215 --> 00:36:17,216
Gosh.

508
00:36:18,342 --> 00:36:19,677
Where are you headed, Ms. Park?

509
00:36:20,469 --> 00:36:22,847
Take me to the fish market, Mr. Kim.

510
00:36:23,306 --> 00:36:24,182
Sure.

511
00:36:46,245 --> 00:36:48,372
Are you busy? You're in a rush.

512
00:36:48,915 --> 00:36:52,126
Don't follow Mun-tak around anymore.
No more secret cameras, either.

513
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:55,171
Why? You said you needed it
to get divorced.

514
00:36:56,255 --> 00:37:00,218
All of Gangnam knows
that he's living together with that wench.

515
00:37:00,301 --> 00:37:01,260
It's fine.

516
00:37:01,969 --> 00:37:04,263
I don't think I should be
asking you to do this.

517
00:37:04,889 --> 00:37:07,183
It's fun. I'm fine with it.

518
00:37:07,892 --> 00:37:09,018
Do you want me to buy you a car?

519
00:37:09,727 --> 00:37:10,853
Give me cash instead.

520
00:37:11,604 --> 00:37:12,563
Okay.

521
00:37:13,522 --> 00:37:15,983
-About your friends I met on the yacht...
-Yes?

522
00:37:16,609 --> 00:37:19,070
One of them is dating my friend.

523
00:37:20,154 --> 00:37:21,906
-What? Who?
-Are you curious?

524
00:37:22,281 --> 00:37:23,699
-Are you serious?
-Yes.

525
00:37:25,076 --> 00:37:26,410
Did they sleep together?

526
00:38:00,861 --> 00:38:02,071
Scalpel 15.

527
00:38:20,756 --> 00:38:23,050
Lift your chin. That's good.

528
00:38:25,761 --> 00:38:29,265
RECENT CALLS

529
00:38:33,769 --> 00:38:36,397
Dr. Jang:
Let's go for a drink sometime.

530
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:38,399
Jong-gyu:
I haven't had so much fun in a while.

531
00:38:38,482 --> 00:38:40,109
Min-su:
How about a joint business in Songdo?

532
00:38:43,821 --> 00:38:45,698
Wife:
I enjoyed the rice punch, Honey.

533
00:38:48,367 --> 00:38:51,037
Ms. Lee:
Your wife just dropped by your office.

534
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:52,913
Dr. Jang, are you at the hotel right now?

535
00:38:53,289 --> 00:38:54,832
I feel anxious, Dr. Jang.

536
00:39:03,257 --> 00:39:05,468
Was it you all along?

537
00:39:05,968 --> 00:39:07,803
What are you doing right now?

538
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:11,057
Ms. Cha, why are you acting this way?

539
00:39:11,182 --> 00:39:12,516
It wasn't Ms. Lee.

540
00:39:13,517 --> 00:39:14,393
What?

541
00:39:22,068 --> 00:39:24,862
I'm going to have a child.

542
00:39:26,739 --> 00:39:27,865
Are you looking for eel?

543
00:39:35,373 --> 00:39:37,958
The eel smells delicious.

544
00:39:38,834 --> 00:39:42,129
-Doesn't it?
-Did you go out just to buy this?

545
00:39:43,172 --> 00:39:44,006
Yes.

546
00:39:44,757 --> 00:39:47,009
There's a difference
between freshwater eel and sea eel.

547
00:39:47,426 --> 00:39:49,428
-Would you like to try some?
-Okay.

548
00:39:54,725 --> 00:39:56,519
It's hot. Open wide.

549
00:39:59,897 --> 00:40:01,065
This is delicious!

550
00:40:01,607 --> 00:40:02,942
-Isn't it?
-Yes.

551
00:40:03,234 --> 00:40:04,735
-Try another bite.
-Okay.

552
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:07,238
Wrap it up like this.

553
00:40:09,907 --> 00:40:13,536
Oh my, you eat so well.

554
00:40:13,619 --> 00:40:14,829
-Isn't it delicious?
-It is.

555
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:19,375
So, you're saying Ms. Park
and Mr. Ahn aren't on good terms?

556
00:40:19,458 --> 00:40:21,252
They treat each other like strangers.

557
00:40:23,003 --> 00:40:26,173
By the way, you're close
with Ms. Park, aren't you?

558
00:40:26,841 --> 00:40:28,217
How do you know each other?

559
00:40:29,009 --> 00:40:31,095
What are you so curious about?

560
00:40:31,178 --> 00:40:33,514
What kind of food does Ms. Park like?

561
00:40:33,597 --> 00:40:35,599
Since when do you call her "Ms. Park"?

562
00:40:37,435 --> 00:40:38,352
The truth is,

563
00:40:38,436 --> 00:40:40,271
I know this family's situation
better than anyone.

564
00:40:40,813 --> 00:40:43,649
If Ms. Park ever needs my help,

565
00:40:43,983 --> 00:40:46,485
I'm always willing to offer it.

566
00:40:48,028 --> 00:40:49,321
Whoa.

567
00:40:52,324 --> 00:40:53,451
I'm sorry, Ms. Lee.

568
00:40:53,534 --> 00:40:55,453
I lost my mind after reading that text.

569
00:40:56,203 --> 00:40:57,121
So...

570
00:40:58,789 --> 00:41:00,291
He does have a woman, doesn't he?

571
00:41:00,833 --> 00:41:02,418
I don't know anything about that.

572
00:41:02,543 --> 00:41:05,629
Why are you being like that? The text
message pretty much looked that way.

573
00:41:05,713 --> 00:41:07,381
You asked if he was at a hotel.

574
00:41:07,965 --> 00:41:10,509
Dr. Jang sleeps at a hotel
from time to time.

575
00:41:10,759 --> 00:41:13,554
He's very tired after performing
multiple surgeries in a row

576
00:41:13,637 --> 00:41:14,972
on Chinese patients.

577
00:41:17,349 --> 00:41:20,603
I may be working for the money
Dr. Jang pays me,

578
00:41:20,769 --> 00:41:23,481
but I don't want to continue
working under such rude treatment.

579
00:41:24,106 --> 00:41:25,816
I intend to resign tomorrow.

580
00:41:28,694 --> 00:41:30,738
Who did you take me for?

581
00:41:31,947 --> 00:41:33,616
I'm sorry, but...

582
00:41:34,241 --> 00:41:36,118
Do you really know nothing about
him having an affair?

583
00:41:36,202 --> 00:41:38,454
I don't know. How would I know that?

584
00:41:38,537 --> 00:41:41,207
And even if I knew,
I only do work-related tasks.

585
00:41:41,290 --> 00:41:43,959
I don't meddle
in other people's family affairs.

586
00:41:44,418 --> 00:41:46,378
You're a woman, too.
Do you really have to be like this?

587
00:41:47,796 --> 00:41:49,215
Dr. Jang finished his surgery.

588
00:41:54,887 --> 00:41:56,096
Here.

589
00:42:00,351 --> 00:42:02,603
Mr. Chairman, let's stop here.

590
00:42:02,686 --> 00:42:03,562
Okay.

591
00:42:13,322 --> 00:42:15,157
-Mr. Chairman.
-Yes?

592
00:42:15,324 --> 00:42:18,869
You know how A-jin is doing
all the housekeeping

593
00:42:19,245 --> 00:42:21,330
in our household.

594
00:42:21,664 --> 00:42:22,498
That's right.

595
00:42:22,957 --> 00:42:25,417
Can I do that instead?

596
00:42:27,795 --> 00:42:29,922
If there was no lady of the house,
it'd be different,

597
00:42:30,047 --> 00:42:32,841
but I'm technically your wife, after all.

598
00:42:33,217 --> 00:42:34,802
Why go through all that trouble?

599
00:42:35,219 --> 00:42:37,680
I give you my cards and money, anyway.

600
00:42:37,763 --> 00:42:41,058
Gosh, I'm not saying I want to
spend money however I want.

601
00:42:41,183 --> 00:42:43,143
This isn't about money.

602
00:42:43,227 --> 00:42:45,521
If that's not it, leave it to A-jin.

603
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:48,190
She's been doing it for years.

604
00:42:48,816 --> 00:42:51,902
She does a really meticulous
and economical job.

605
00:42:52,194 --> 00:42:56,657
She even separates personal expenses
from business expenses.

606
00:42:57,074 --> 00:42:58,033
She's a smart egg.

607
00:43:01,161 --> 00:43:02,413
Okay.

608
00:43:13,924 --> 00:43:17,595
Ma'am, would you like an indie hairstyle
or a Pippi hairstyle?

609
00:43:17,886 --> 00:43:19,930
Oh my, how do you know
the Pippi hairstyle?

610
00:43:20,598 --> 00:43:22,266
I'm a little old-fashioned.

611
00:43:22,349 --> 00:43:25,227
Oh my, you really are. May I ask your age?

612
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:26,478
I'm ten years old.

613
00:43:26,604 --> 00:43:30,399
Oh my, you look young for your age.
You look like you're nine.

614
00:43:30,608 --> 00:43:32,693
You look really young for your age, too.

615
00:43:33,736 --> 00:43:35,279
Really? Thank you.

616
00:43:35,821 --> 00:43:37,740
I'll do a skin test to make you pretty.

617
00:43:37,823 --> 00:43:38,657
Okay.

618
00:43:41,619 --> 00:43:43,037
WAY SKIN

619
00:43:43,912 --> 00:43:45,706
BASIC SKIN TEST

620
00:43:50,377 --> 00:43:52,171
Oh my, am I getting prettier?

621
00:43:52,254 --> 00:43:53,505
Yes, you are.

622
00:43:55,215 --> 00:43:56,425
Here are your results.

623
00:43:57,593 --> 00:43:58,510
VERY MOIST, 92%

624
00:43:59,053 --> 00:44:00,638
How should I pay?

625
00:44:01,597 --> 00:44:03,807
Since you're pretty,
you don't have to pay.

626
00:44:04,308 --> 00:44:06,810
Come here. Let me give you a hug.

627
00:44:10,981 --> 00:44:13,609
It's time for our princess
to cut her nails.

628
00:44:13,734 --> 00:44:16,362
-I'm going to do it.
-I'll do it for you.

629
00:44:16,445 --> 00:44:18,822
That's okay. You've been
getting texts this whole time.

630
00:44:18,906 --> 00:44:20,240
-You should read them.
-Okay.

631
00:44:23,035 --> 00:44:23,911
Who is it?

632
00:44:24,286 --> 00:44:26,622
-It's my partner.
-Do you have a partner, too?

633
00:44:26,914 --> 00:44:27,915
I do.

634
00:44:28,874 --> 00:44:31,377
Don't fight with your partner
and be friendly with each other, okay?

635
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:33,087
Will do.

636
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:35,756
PARTNER

637
00:44:36,715 --> 00:44:39,551
"It rained that day so we could meet

638
00:44:40,094 --> 00:44:42,680
and the man from the third floor
scratched my car.

639
00:44:44,139 --> 00:44:47,559
They were all miracles
that occurred so we could meet.

640
00:44:48,352 --> 00:44:49,645
But I didn't know that."

641
00:44:50,604 --> 00:44:53,023
Isn't this paragraph captivating?

642
00:45:07,454 --> 00:45:08,414
A-jin.

643
00:45:08,539 --> 00:45:12,000
Ms. Baek, is there a way
I can get my hands on another copy

644
00:45:12,084 --> 00:45:13,961
of the book of poetry you donated?

645
00:45:14,294 --> 00:45:15,129
Why?

646
00:45:15,963 --> 00:45:18,882
I gave that book to Mr. Kang as a gift...

647
00:45:18,966 --> 00:45:20,384
Who did you give it to?

648
00:45:20,676 --> 00:45:22,094
Mr. Kang.

649
00:45:24,555 --> 00:45:25,556
No way.

650
00:45:25,806 --> 00:45:28,600
LOVE OR HURT MAKES ME BLOOM

651
00:45:32,896 --> 00:45:35,774
That's Mr. Kang's book of poetry.

652
00:45:35,941 --> 00:45:37,526
He writes poetry.

653
00:45:37,609 --> 00:45:39,903
His pen name is Tae-rim Kang.

654
00:45:50,706 --> 00:45:52,332
How could you do that to me?

655
00:45:54,418 --> 00:45:55,461
I'm passing through

656
00:45:56,295 --> 00:45:59,298
your area right now.

657
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:00,883
Would you like to come out for a moment?

658
00:46:02,301 --> 00:46:05,220
They won't sell
so I have around 100 copies.

659
00:46:06,847 --> 00:46:09,349
Are you happy you made me into a fool?

660
00:46:09,558 --> 00:46:11,602
How did I make you into a fool?

661
00:46:11,685 --> 00:46:14,021
You should have been surprised and said,

662
00:46:14,188 --> 00:46:15,981
"This is my book of poetry,"

663
00:46:16,648 --> 00:46:18,108
when I gave it to you.

664
00:46:18,817 --> 00:46:20,152
Then I wouldn't have looked cool.

665
00:46:22,863 --> 00:46:24,031
Let me see it for a second.

666
00:46:31,163 --> 00:46:32,664
Tae-rim Kang

667
00:46:34,166 --> 00:46:37,044
See? Isn't this dramatic?

668
00:46:38,420 --> 00:46:40,547
The poet signed the book himself.

669
00:46:41,131 --> 00:46:42,382
You should be honored.

670
00:46:43,717 --> 00:46:46,053
Yes, I'm very honored.

671
00:46:46,178 --> 00:46:48,555
Why do I have to be the one
who's embarrassed

672
00:46:48,639 --> 00:46:50,432
when you're praising yourself and all?

673
00:46:51,975 --> 00:46:53,060
Have you had dinner yet?

674
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:54,895
Yes, have you?

675
00:46:55,771 --> 00:46:57,981
If you haven't eaten,
I haven't eaten either.

676
00:46:58,065 --> 00:46:59,691
If you have, I have, too.

677
00:47:00,275 --> 00:47:01,527
That's what dinner is all about.

678
00:47:03,737 --> 00:47:05,656
If you flip to page 35,

679
00:47:05,739 --> 00:47:07,407
there's a poem called Three Meals a Day.

680
00:47:07,658 --> 00:47:08,909
Read it when you get home.

681
00:47:10,369 --> 00:47:13,247
Don't be too moved
after reading my book of poetry.

682
00:47:28,762 --> 00:47:30,430
I'm very sorry, Ms. Lee.

683
00:47:40,566 --> 00:47:43,026
Take a vacation for a few days.

684
00:47:45,654 --> 00:47:46,530
Here.

685
00:48:12,806 --> 00:48:14,349
I think my wife caught on.

686
00:48:14,516 --> 00:48:16,393
Let's not see each other
for the time being.

687
00:48:29,865 --> 00:48:31,199
Did you do it?

688
00:48:33,660 --> 00:48:35,954
-Why do you think that?
-Just because.

689
00:48:36,788 --> 00:48:38,206
This thought came to mind.

690
00:48:38,665 --> 00:48:39,666
"Who could have been

691
00:48:40,083 --> 00:48:43,045
the person who wanted to hit me so badly?"

692
00:48:46,381 --> 00:48:47,674
I guess

693
00:48:48,258 --> 00:48:51,386
you don't treat anyone else
as recklessly as you treat me.

694
00:48:52,179 --> 00:48:53,972
I'm going to find out who did this

695
00:48:54,264 --> 00:48:55,891
and give them a taste
of their own medicine

696
00:48:56,391 --> 00:48:58,435
or lock them up in jail.

697
00:48:58,644 --> 00:48:59,770
You should.

698
00:49:00,354 --> 00:49:01,897
You shouldn't let anyone hit you.

699
00:49:02,814 --> 00:49:05,567
-Give it a try.
-Is something up with you these days?

700
00:49:06,234 --> 00:49:07,319
Or are you crazy?

701
00:49:08,111 --> 00:49:09,404
Don't mess with me

702
00:49:09,488 --> 00:49:11,615
unless you want to be stripped naked
and kicked out.

703
00:49:57,577 --> 00:50:00,080
You seem excited after getting remarried.

704
00:50:00,539 --> 00:50:02,958
That woman came to this house
and she knew exactly what she was doing.

705
00:50:06,044 --> 00:50:07,295
Father.

706
00:50:08,046 --> 00:50:09,673
You shouldn't do this to me.

707
00:50:12,175 --> 00:50:13,051
I...

708
00:50:15,011 --> 00:50:18,265
feel wronged about many things, but...

709
00:50:20,350 --> 00:50:23,729
I've held it in because of my late mom.

710
00:50:25,021 --> 00:50:29,735
I didn't hire a guy to follow you
to take over your company...

711
00:50:29,818 --> 00:50:30,902
Shut your mouth!

712
00:50:31,903 --> 00:50:34,698
How dare you? You killed a man!

713
00:50:35,574 --> 00:50:37,784
I wasn't the one who killed him!

714
00:50:38,577 --> 00:50:40,829
It was an accident!
How many times have I told you?

715
00:50:41,621 --> 00:50:43,290
What reason did I have to do that?

716
00:50:44,666 --> 00:50:48,336
What reason did I have
to hit your secretary with my car?

717
00:50:48,420 --> 00:50:51,757
Then why did you incite the directors
to make me step down

718
00:50:51,965 --> 00:50:54,718
from the management line
at the board meeting?

719
00:50:55,051 --> 00:50:56,386
Was that a misunderstanding, too?

720
00:50:56,928 --> 00:50:59,556
You dirty bastard.
I can't call you my son!

721
00:50:59,639 --> 00:51:00,974
That, too...

722
00:51:01,808 --> 00:51:03,185
was a plot.

723
00:51:04,019 --> 00:51:07,731
Why do you trust your directors
over your own child?

724
00:51:07,939 --> 00:51:11,401
-Shut up!
-You treat me like an insect!

725
00:51:11,485 --> 00:51:12,527
You son of a bitch!

726
00:51:14,988 --> 00:51:15,947
Mr. Chairman!

727
00:51:18,700 --> 00:51:20,827
Don't you think I know
your ulterior motive?

728
00:51:21,620 --> 00:51:24,956
You're just a nobody
who easily made it into this family.

729
00:51:41,264 --> 00:51:42,265
You better

730
00:51:42,933 --> 00:51:43,975
watch your mouth.

731
00:51:44,851 --> 00:51:45,685
What?

732
00:51:48,939 --> 00:51:51,107
Your wife and kid.

733
00:51:51,691 --> 00:51:55,028
If you want them to be
treated like human beings

734
00:51:55,111 --> 00:51:56,613
in this household,

735
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:58,782
you better keep your mouth shut.

736
00:52:01,034 --> 00:52:03,245
Are you crazy?

737
00:52:03,328 --> 00:52:04,204
I'm

738
00:52:04,996 --> 00:52:07,249
the lady of this household.

739
00:52:07,958 --> 00:52:10,502
I told you last time, too,
that I'm your father's wife.

740
00:52:10,877 --> 00:52:12,420
I told you to watch your mouth.

741
00:52:13,171 --> 00:52:16,299
Why are you making me repeat myself?

742
00:52:18,051 --> 00:52:20,345
If you spew that kind of bullshit
once more,

743
00:52:21,888 --> 00:52:24,808
your wife and son will get kicked out too.

744
00:52:26,726 --> 00:52:28,228
This is your last warning.

745
00:52:39,614 --> 00:52:40,448
Stop it.

746
00:52:48,623 --> 00:52:50,208
Are you feeling better?

747
00:52:50,667 --> 00:52:51,585
I'm fine.

748
00:52:53,128 --> 00:52:55,589
Don't think about anything
and just go to sleep.

749
00:52:56,590 --> 00:52:58,174
He's not my child, but my enemy.

750
00:52:59,426 --> 00:53:01,386
That's why we should give birth
to a good kid

751
00:53:01,469 --> 00:53:04,097
who won't be our enemy.

752
00:53:15,150 --> 00:53:17,694
I don't have any power,

753
00:53:17,777 --> 00:53:20,822
so all your kids look down on me.

754
00:53:22,365 --> 00:53:23,366
I'm sorry.

755
00:53:26,161 --> 00:53:27,037
Where are you going?

756
00:53:28,246 --> 00:53:29,789
Go to bed without me.

757
00:53:30,415 --> 00:53:32,584
I'm going to wait until you come back.

758
00:53:33,627 --> 00:53:36,254
There's no need for that.
I'm not in the mood.

759
00:53:37,213 --> 00:53:39,174
Hey, don't be like that.

760
00:53:40,008 --> 00:53:41,426
Go to bed.

761
00:54:17,295 --> 00:54:19,965
"If you're having a hard time, eat.

762
00:54:20,507 --> 00:54:21,967
Then you'll regain your strength.

763
00:54:22,550 --> 00:54:24,135
Eat all three meals.

764
00:54:26,012 --> 00:54:27,889
Then you'll burst with energy.

765
00:54:28,348 --> 00:54:30,141
Live with the strength food gives you."

766
00:54:30,809 --> 00:54:31,643
What the heck?

767
00:54:33,019 --> 00:54:34,145
How is this a poem?

768
00:54:40,151 --> 00:54:42,779
Ju-mi, why aren't you sleeping?

769
00:54:44,322 --> 00:54:46,700
What is this? Have you made up?

770
00:54:47,993 --> 00:54:49,828
Is a married couple having a fling?
What is this?

771
00:54:49,911 --> 00:54:51,287
It's not like that, Jae-hui.

772
00:54:51,579 --> 00:54:53,540
Why don't you come in?
Don't just stand there.

773
00:54:53,623 --> 00:54:54,666
That's okay.

774
00:54:58,545 --> 00:55:00,005
What are you going to do with Ju-mi?

775
00:55:00,213 --> 00:55:02,632
What else? We just have to live like this.

776
00:55:02,841 --> 00:55:04,300
You're really hopeless.

777
00:55:04,718 --> 00:55:05,927
Are you going to stay in America?

778
00:55:06,011 --> 00:55:07,012
What else can I do?

779
00:55:07,637 --> 00:55:09,264
If I keep sticking around,

780
00:55:09,347 --> 00:55:11,433
that accident could come back to haunt me.

781
00:55:12,350 --> 00:55:14,602
Damn it. I'm out of money, too.

782
00:55:16,771 --> 00:55:19,649
Fifty-two percent of the company's
stocks belong to Father.

783
00:55:20,525 --> 00:55:22,861
-What about Jae-seok?
-He probably owns around 10%.

784
00:55:23,069 --> 00:55:24,988
He received it with a certification
of merit last time.

785
00:55:32,620 --> 00:55:33,955
I have no interest in the company.

786
00:55:34,289 --> 00:55:36,166
I already made a promise
with the old man, too.

787
00:55:36,541 --> 00:55:38,543
I promised to keep my hands off
of the company's shares.

788
00:55:39,294 --> 00:55:41,755
Then what is it that you want exactly?

789
00:55:43,256 --> 00:55:45,133
-Cash.
-What?

790
00:55:45,216 --> 00:55:47,927
I have an unbelievable business idea.

791
00:55:49,637 --> 00:55:52,307
I guess this is why Dad hates us.

792
00:55:53,641 --> 00:55:57,145
Don't associate me with you.
I'm different from you.

793
00:55:57,228 --> 00:55:58,855
I'm tired. Go downstairs.

794
00:56:09,532 --> 00:56:10,784
I want to call you.

795
00:56:13,745 --> 00:56:16,581
Seong-hui: I want to call you.

796
00:56:16,664 --> 00:56:17,582
CALL

797
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:24,756
Are we

798
00:56:25,298 --> 00:56:27,258
really going to end it here?

799
00:56:28,968 --> 00:56:30,887
Don't we love each other?

800
00:56:32,263 --> 00:56:35,100
Our love hasn't ended yet.

801
00:56:35,809 --> 00:56:37,519
I thought of you

802
00:56:38,436 --> 00:56:40,396
so I made potato pancakes.

803
00:56:41,356 --> 00:56:43,483
But I don't want to eat this by myself.

804
00:57:08,883 --> 00:57:10,760
Okay, get in!

805
00:57:13,304 --> 00:57:15,056
Okay, here we go.

806
00:58:08,693 --> 00:58:11,279
CAREGIVER

807
00:58:13,781 --> 00:58:15,366
-Hello?
-A-jin?

808
00:58:15,992 --> 00:58:17,577
I'm sorry for calling you so early.

809
00:58:18,161 --> 00:58:21,664
Can you come by with Jae-seok
before he goes to work?

810
00:58:22,332 --> 00:58:23,458
Okay, I will.

811
00:59:07,710 --> 00:59:08,920
Jae-seok Ahn!

812
00:59:10,213 --> 00:59:11,339
Jae-seok Ahn!

813
00:59:12,382 --> 00:59:13,508
Stop right there!

814
00:59:20,056 --> 00:59:22,433
I told you to stop! Stop!

815
00:59:46,749 --> 00:59:49,210
I beg you. Please don't take away
her father

816
00:59:49,586 --> 00:59:51,254
from Ji-hu.

817
00:59:51,337 --> 00:59:52,213
Please.

818
00:59:53,548 --> 00:59:54,632
Are you pregnant?

819
00:59:54,966 --> 00:59:57,427
From now on, you take care
of all the family affairs.

820
00:59:57,510 --> 01:00:00,305
All of this is for your own good.

821
01:00:00,471 --> 01:00:02,849
-You.
-How dare you call me like that?

822
01:00:03,558 --> 01:00:04,517
Leave, now.

823
01:00:04,601 --> 01:00:06,853
I don't think I can break up with her.

824
01:00:07,061 --> 01:00:08,271
Go out and die!

825
01:00:09,063 --> 01:00:11,899
I'll do what you can't, A-jin.

826
01:00:12,066 --> 01:00:15,153
-Did you have an affair with Jae-seok Ahn?
-Who...

827
01:00:15,361 --> 01:00:18,197
How dare you mess around with someone
who has a daughter and a wife?

828
01:00:19,407 --> 01:00:21,284
I know who is backing you up,

829
01:00:21,534 --> 01:00:23,786
but if you flirt with my husband again,

830
01:00:24,329 --> 01:00:25,747
I'll kill you.

831
01:00:25,913 --> 01:00:28,166
I'm too scared to go back to that house.

832
01:00:28,291 --> 01:00:29,334
I'll buy you a new house.

833
01:00:29,417 --> 01:00:32,295
A-jin bought it for me,
but the house is under my name.

834
01:00:32,378 --> 01:00:33,755
What do you think you are doing?

835
01:00:34,422 --> 01:00:35,965
How dare you kick me out?

836
01:00:36,174 --> 01:00:37,050
Shoot me.

837
01:00:37,467 --> 01:00:40,261
If you don't shoot me here,
you'll look ridiculous.

838
01:00:40,845 --> 01:00:42,764
Shoot me!

839
01:00:44,015 --> 01:00:46,225
