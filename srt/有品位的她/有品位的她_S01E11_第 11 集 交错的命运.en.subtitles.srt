1
00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:42,834
I will get my hands dirty for you.

2
00:00:44,043 --> 00:00:45,670
I'll do what you can't,

3
00:00:46,629 --> 00:00:47,589
A-jin.

4
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:49,841
The lady who bought my painting today
is married

5
00:00:50,175 --> 00:00:52,135
to the CEO of the biggest natto company
in Japan.

6
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:53,887
I heard that she has a keen eye for art.

7
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:56,264
She said this person she hates
is giving her murderous thoughts...

8
00:00:56,347 --> 00:00:57,599
She told me to hurt her.

9
00:00:57,682 --> 00:00:58,933
He's putting on a show, Father.

10
00:00:59,726 --> 00:01:01,895
I bet he's colluding with this woman.

11
00:01:01,978 --> 00:01:04,647
Shut up! How dare you spew such nonsense?

12
00:01:04,814 --> 00:01:06,024
I can easily tell the police

13
00:01:06,107 --> 00:01:08,860
that the bullet wasn't misfired
and that he actually tried to kill me.

14
00:01:09,027 --> 00:01:11,905
I've been thinking
about going back to school.

15
00:01:11,988 --> 00:01:12,989
I'm wondering

16
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:16,117
if you can create a position for me even
if it's nothing official or proper.

17
00:01:16,451 --> 00:01:19,287
I'm raising an ill child.
Are you saying I should have an affair

18
00:01:20,246 --> 00:01:21,539
just like what his father is doing?

19
00:01:21,623 --> 00:01:23,083
I'm pregnant!

20
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:26,252
Whose kid, is it?
We'll find out when the baby is born.

21
00:01:26,961 --> 00:01:29,005
Why did you decide to drop the charges
all of a sudden?

22
00:01:29,464 --> 00:01:32,175
A-jin bought it for me,
but the house is under my name.

23
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:34,469
I no longer consider him my husband,

24
00:01:35,261 --> 00:01:36,930
but Ji-hu still needs a dad.

25
00:01:37,388 --> 00:01:38,264
A-jin!

26
00:01:38,348 --> 00:01:40,058
Who are you going
to live with at that house?

27
00:01:40,225 --> 00:01:41,351
How could you?

28
00:01:41,559 --> 00:01:43,603
Did you faint
because of what I said earlier?

29
00:01:43,895 --> 00:01:47,190
Try to be cool about it, okay?
Just accept it.

30
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:49,150
Jae-seok Ahn.

31
00:01:50,401 --> 00:01:53,029
You're out of my life for good now.

32
00:02:32,902 --> 00:02:36,114
An attempt to ascend to the upper class
by a lower-class who's comparable to a pig

33
00:02:36,447 --> 00:02:37,949
that hates the blue tag on its back,

34
00:02:38,741 --> 00:02:41,870
is just as painful as a salmon
migrating against the current

35
00:02:41,953 --> 00:02:43,079
to lay its eggs.

36
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:45,999
After that pain,

37
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:48,501
does the salmon know it will die?

38
00:02:50,712 --> 00:02:53,798
If it knew... it probably wouldn't have

39
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:57,051
swam against the current.

40
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:19,574
Where are we going right now?

41
00:03:20,241 --> 00:03:21,743
I said you shouldn't leave the hospital.

42
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:23,620
I want you to take on a case.

43
00:03:24,287 --> 00:03:25,163
Pardon?

44
00:03:26,748 --> 00:03:27,916
A divorce case.

45
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,318
Hello.

46
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:02,575
Let me see that patterned bag
and that yellow bag.

47
00:04:02,825 --> 00:04:03,701
Sure, Ma'am.

48
00:04:30,186 --> 00:04:33,564
Ma'am, they both suit you so well.

49
00:04:33,648 --> 00:04:34,482
Really?

50
00:04:35,316 --> 00:04:38,194
We carry a variety of colors
so why don't you browse around?

51
00:04:43,241 --> 00:04:46,244
I'll just take one in every color.

52
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:48,746
Pardon?

53
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:01,175
How would you like to pay?

54
00:05:02,427 --> 00:05:03,344
A lump-sum payment.

55
00:05:05,054 --> 00:05:06,389
I'll complete the transaction.

56
00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:24,198
Get out of this house.

57
00:05:31,247 --> 00:05:32,957
What are you looking at?
I told you to leave.

58
00:05:33,124 --> 00:05:34,042
Where would I go?

59
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:36,127
I told you to get out of this house!

60
00:05:37,253 --> 00:05:38,171
Are you mad?

61
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:40,173
What? Mad?

62
00:05:41,215 --> 00:05:43,176
Ji-hu's still sleeping. Quiet down.

63
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:45,762
Let's get divorced.

64
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:48,973
Hey! You shouldn't talk about
a divorce as if it's nothing.

65
00:05:49,223 --> 00:05:50,141
Is marriage a joke to you?

66
00:05:50,808 --> 00:05:53,061
Look who's talking. You must be crazy.

67
00:05:53,227 --> 00:05:54,187
You've lost your mind.

68
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:56,481
That's my question.
Is marriage a joke to you?

69
00:05:56,731 --> 00:05:59,484
A-jin, you're starting to lose
your refinement these days.

70
00:05:59,567 --> 00:06:00,485
Shut your mouth!

71
00:06:01,944 --> 00:06:04,906
I'm going to raise Ji-hu
and we'll split the assets.

72
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:08,451
And, the house you two
are living in now is mine.

73
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,871
Ji-hu and I have to move in there,
so you two must move out immediately.

74
00:06:12,163 --> 00:06:14,207
A divorce? Who said we can get a divorce?

75
00:06:14,332 --> 00:06:15,917
Who else? Me!

76
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:20,505
I don't want our Ji-hu
to live with a man like you.

77
00:06:21,339 --> 00:06:22,507
I also worry

78
00:06:23,257 --> 00:06:26,135
that you'll raise her to have
distorted values of men.

79
00:06:26,385 --> 00:06:29,889
And above all else,
you have no right to be a father.

80
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,725
A-jin, I love you.

81
00:06:33,434 --> 00:06:35,269
And I can't live without Ji-hu.

82
00:06:35,353 --> 00:06:38,106
No! You're not allowed to love me

83
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:39,524
and you have to live without Ji-hu.

84
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:41,776
Why? You're...

85
00:06:42,944 --> 00:06:44,362
a total scumbag. That's why.

86
00:06:45,029 --> 00:06:47,490
-A-jin!
-I'll file a lawsuit if you don't consent.

87
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:49,951
Let's not drag it out and end it quickly.

88
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:52,411
No, I'm not getting a divorce.
I won't do it!

89
00:06:54,455 --> 00:06:55,790
You're unbelievable!

90
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:59,669
Then hire a lawyer. I'll file a lawsuit.

91
00:06:59,877 --> 00:07:01,921
-A-jin...
-Don't touch me!

92
00:07:11,347 --> 00:07:12,473
Good job.

93
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:28,281
Son?

94
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:31,909
Let's go inside, okay?
You must be cold. Let's go, okay?

95
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:34,704
If you ask me how my life has been

96
00:07:35,788 --> 00:07:38,040
I'd tell you that half of my life was sad.

97
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:40,543
Joy, anger, sorrow, and pleasure.

98
00:07:41,252 --> 00:07:44,547
I would say my life
was overwhelmingly filled

99
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:45,923
with anger and sorrow.

100
00:07:53,389 --> 00:07:55,016
Is Dad not riding his bike these days?

101
00:07:55,725 --> 00:07:57,477
No, he's not.

102
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:00,855
Where did he go today?

103
00:08:01,063 --> 00:08:02,982
Is he working on a Saturday?

104
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:06,944
-Ji-hu.
-Yeah?

105
00:08:08,196 --> 00:08:10,406
Should we move to a new place
closer to your school?

106
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:12,700
You said we'll move
when I'm in grade four.

107
00:08:13,409 --> 00:08:15,119
Let's go a little earlier.

108
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:16,454
Okay, sounds good.

109
00:08:17,455 --> 00:08:18,748
But it's possible

110
00:08:19,624 --> 00:08:21,417
that we'll move, just the two of us.

111
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:23,586
Why?

112
00:08:25,296 --> 00:08:27,590
Your dad might have to live here.

113
00:08:30,927 --> 00:08:31,844
Ji-hu?

114
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:35,431
Mom, you're going to split up
with Dad, aren't you?

115
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:37,683
No, it's not like that.

116
00:08:38,726 --> 00:08:40,895
Your dad has to resolve
Grandpa's company issue and...

117
00:08:40,978 --> 00:08:42,855
Mom, I like

118
00:08:43,689 --> 00:08:44,982
living together

119
00:08:45,483 --> 00:08:47,860
with both you and Dad,

120
00:08:49,153 --> 00:08:52,281
but if that's difficult, I'll understand.

121
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:56,994
Ji-hu.

122
00:08:58,162 --> 00:08:59,372
I heard that, at times,

123
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:02,625
kids are unable to understand
the feelings of grownups.

124
00:09:03,751 --> 00:09:07,129
I won't throw a tantrum
because you I love you and Dad.

125
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,390
Mom, this is

126
00:09:18,307 --> 00:09:19,767
a part of my life.

127
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:23,271
I'll accept it.

128
00:09:27,149 --> 00:09:28,484
"A part of life."

129
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:31,696
The parts come together like a puzzle,

130
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:33,281
and form one whole picture.

131
00:09:34,907 --> 00:09:37,243
Life is usually an incomplete
and poor-quality work

132
00:09:37,326 --> 00:09:39,370
that originally aimed
for a complete masterpiece.

133
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:43,082
But at times,
there are really lucky people

134
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:45,793
whose poor-quality lives
transform into a masterpiece.

135
00:09:47,378 --> 00:09:50,423
Although, it's uncertain
if that luck will remain lucky

136
00:09:50,881 --> 00:09:52,258
until the very end.

137
00:09:53,342 --> 00:09:55,136
How should we accept the payment?

138
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:58,431
Postpone paying Seong-hui
for the time being

139
00:09:58,723 --> 00:09:59,974
until A-jin goes to see her.

140
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,434
Pardon?

141
00:10:01,809 --> 00:10:04,437
Please delay my payment
for Seong-hui Yun's artwork.

142
00:10:04,937 --> 00:10:07,023
-Why?
-I'm going to ask for the painting

143
00:10:07,565 --> 00:10:08,774
instead of my husband.

144
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,779
A-jin called me this morning,

145
00:10:13,988 --> 00:10:16,574
saying she'll file to seize the payment.

146
00:10:16,991 --> 00:10:19,076
It's not a difficult request
so we should cooperate.

147
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:22,663
Oh my, why? It's not like
it's her commission.

148
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:24,624
She said it's a premium for her husband.

149
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:27,001
Isn't A-jin really attractive?

150
00:10:27,668 --> 00:10:30,087
Her method of problem-solving is too sexy.

151
00:10:35,384 --> 00:10:37,511
Jin-hee, I'm so sorry.

152
00:10:38,763 --> 00:10:40,598
-That's okay.
-Jae-sik didn't come to work

153
00:10:40,681 --> 00:10:42,183
because he doesn't have classes today.

154
00:10:42,266 --> 00:10:43,976
That's okay. I just have to
finish these, right?

155
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:46,228
Yes, I know I'm being shameless,
but I'll trust you with it.

156
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:47,563
Okay, don't worry.

157
00:10:51,025 --> 00:10:52,818
Are you finished? Bye!

158
00:10:54,028 --> 00:10:55,571
Ji-hu! Gosh.

159
00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:58,449
I'll drive the other kids
so you can leave with Ji-hu.

160
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:04,705
Oh, don't do this.
I'll get in trouble if A-jin finds out.

161
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:07,041
What do you mean? It's not much.

162
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:09,960
Buy Ji-hu a sandwich with this.

163
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:11,837
I shouldn't accept this.

164
00:11:12,296 --> 00:11:17,051
If I knew a good person like you,
I'd want to be close friends with them.

165
00:11:18,469 --> 00:11:19,929
A-jin is so lucky.

166
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:22,181
Thank you, Ms. Baek.

167
00:11:22,848 --> 00:11:25,267
If you ever need me
to fill in again, give me a call.

168
00:11:25,851 --> 00:11:27,686
I appreciate the thought. Get home safely.

169
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:28,813
Okay.

170
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:30,147
Goodbye.

171
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:33,067
Yes.

172
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:40,449
Here.

173
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:44,078
-Are you all right?
-What do you mean?

174
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:45,454
Your physical health.

175
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:47,540
Yes, I'm fine.

176
00:11:48,749 --> 00:11:49,583
Are you okay?

177
00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:51,836
What do you mean this time?

178
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:53,879
Your heart. Doesn't it hurt?

179
00:11:57,508 --> 00:11:58,384
It hurts.

180
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:00,261
That's all I wanted to hear.

181
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:02,221
What do you mean by that?

182
00:12:02,304 --> 00:12:04,515
If you hurt too much, you don't
even realize you're hurting.

183
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:07,893
This means you're more than
capable of recovering.

184
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:14,108
I came here as your client
who wants to file for a divorce.

185
00:12:14,483 --> 00:12:17,570
I know. That's why you made me
come to work on a Saturday.

186
00:12:18,904 --> 00:12:21,991
-I'll speak as your lawyer from now on.
-Okay.

187
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:23,784
What's your reason for this divorce?

188
00:12:24,493 --> 00:12:25,411
My husband's affair.

189
00:12:25,953 --> 00:12:27,538
You have physical evidence, right?

190
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:29,874
Yes.

191
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:34,044
Is that woman someone you know?

192
00:12:34,545 --> 00:12:37,840
She's an artist I've known
and my daughter's art teacher.

193
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:40,759
They're saying they love each other.

194
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:45,764
In such circumstances,
the husband usually asks for a divorce.

195
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:47,933
Didn't your husband ask you for a divorce?

196
00:12:48,642 --> 00:12:52,480
No, what my husband wants is coexistence.

197
00:12:55,399 --> 00:12:57,610
He wants me to accept
his relationship with that woman

198
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,029
while maintaining our marriage.

199
00:13:00,404 --> 00:13:02,406
How long has his affair lasted for?

200
00:13:06,243 --> 00:13:07,703
I think it's been over a month.

201
00:13:08,245 --> 00:13:09,663
Are you really going to get divorced?

202
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:12,416
You have no intention
of living with it, right?

203
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:14,960
-What did you say?
-Don't misunderstand.

204
00:13:15,252 --> 00:13:16,295
I didn't mean it like that.

205
00:13:17,338 --> 00:13:20,466
The truth is, there are many women
who calculate their profit and loss

206
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:23,219
and put up with their husband,

207
00:13:23,719 --> 00:13:25,179
even if they've cheated.

208
00:13:25,721 --> 00:13:28,057
The divorce process is very agonizing.

209
00:13:29,767 --> 00:13:31,852
From division of property
to child custody,

210
00:13:32,853 --> 00:13:34,522
it'll be a gruesome battle.

211
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:37,483
My husband is already living
with that woman.

212
00:13:37,733 --> 00:13:40,569
And he's being too confident
about it for a man with a family.

213
00:13:41,111 --> 00:13:43,531
I should make hold him responsible
for our failed marriage.

214
00:13:43,697 --> 00:13:44,740
In a legal sense, as well.

215
00:13:45,783 --> 00:13:48,869
But, due to the abolition
of punishment for adultery,

216
00:13:48,953 --> 00:13:52,873
you know he can't be punished
for having a concubine, right?

217
00:13:53,624 --> 00:13:56,168
So this is a civil case,
not a criminal case.

218
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:02,174
I guess the law feels
very differently about this.

219
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:06,053
What is your husband's...

220
00:14:07,054 --> 00:14:08,639
What is your husband's name?

221
00:14:10,057 --> 00:14:10,975
Jae-seok Ahn.

222
00:14:13,018 --> 00:14:14,520
Jae-seok Ahn's affair is certainly

223
00:14:14,603 --> 00:14:17,189
an important reason
for your failed marriage,

224
00:14:17,815 --> 00:14:19,358
but there's an even bigger fault.

225
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:23,696
He tried to push his own values
onto the other person.

226
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:27,324
That could become the decisive
reason for this divorce.

227
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:31,370
He tried to push you to accept
that he has a concubine,

228
00:14:31,579 --> 00:14:33,998
although you possess
completely different values.

229
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:36,542
This is his fault.

230
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:42,131
There's one more problem.

231
00:14:45,092 --> 00:14:46,385
She said she'll file for a divorce.

232
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:51,181
Are you saying your wife
found out about this house?

233
00:14:51,432 --> 00:14:52,808
That's what I'm telling you.

234
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:55,644
She said she'll divorce me and live
in this house with our daughter.

235
00:14:55,811 --> 00:14:56,937
Then what about me?

236
00:14:57,438 --> 00:14:59,773
You and I would have to live
where A-jin lives right now.

237
00:14:59,857 --> 00:15:02,735
So, she's telling us to live
in Father's annex.

238
00:15:03,027 --> 00:15:05,529
That's nonsense. I won't take
a step outside this house!

239
00:15:10,326 --> 00:15:12,620
Honey, whose name is this house under?

240
00:15:13,454 --> 00:15:14,455
Whose else? Mine.

241
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:16,373
Let's put it under my name.

242
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:18,626
-What?
-Only then,

243
00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:20,836
your wife won't be able to say
that she'll move in here.

244
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:23,297
That's not what's important here!

245
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:25,633
Honey, you don't want to
get a divorce, do you?

246
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:28,052
Then, you have to
put this house under my name.

247
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:30,846
Then she won't have anything
to gain, so she won't get divorced.

248
00:15:31,013 --> 00:15:33,390
That woman wants to get a divorce
just so she can have this house.

249
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:36,101
I don't want to get a divorce.
I won't do it!

250
00:15:38,312 --> 00:15:40,230
That's why I'm telling you
to put it under my name!

251
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:51,200
Ms. Park would like to see you.

252
00:16:00,709 --> 00:16:02,920
You'll leave as soon as Un-gyu writes
his college entrance exam.

253
00:16:03,545 --> 00:16:07,341
I asked your father to consider
your circumstances one more time.

254
00:16:08,842 --> 00:16:11,220
I'm so thankful. How should I repay you?

255
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:15,516
Well, it's not like
we're strangers, right?

256
00:16:16,725 --> 00:16:17,601
About that man...

257
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:21,105
The man I instigated to kill you.

258
00:16:22,356 --> 00:16:23,774
Tell me his phone number.

259
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:28,153
Shouldn't you know about him
better than I do?

260
00:16:28,946 --> 00:16:30,155
That's right.

261
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:32,574
It slipped my mind.

262
00:16:33,909 --> 00:16:35,619
I accidentally erased his number.

263
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:37,830
I would like it back.

264
00:16:37,913 --> 00:16:40,332
You received his number
last time, didn't you?

265
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:46,964
Why? Are you scared

266
00:16:47,381 --> 00:16:48,924
that I might do something else to you?

267
00:16:58,183 --> 00:16:59,518
Don't worry.

268
00:16:59,977 --> 00:17:01,645
I need to finish what I started.

269
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:03,605
That's all.

270
00:17:14,658 --> 00:17:16,452
Seong-hui Yun, A-jin Woo

271
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:23,000
Seong-hui Yun

272
00:17:32,134 --> 00:17:34,511
Mr. Ahn! We're in big trouble!

273
00:17:34,928 --> 00:17:36,555
What's the matter?

274
00:17:36,764 --> 00:17:37,765
Look at this.

275
00:17:39,016 --> 00:17:43,562
Among Daesung Pulp's products,
a fluorescent whitening agent

276
00:17:43,645 --> 00:17:46,023
was found in large amounts.

277
00:17:49,109 --> 00:17:51,695
A sanitary paper company
recently responded to the controversy

278
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:55,407
surrounding the fluorescent whitening
agent found in their toilet paper.

279
00:17:55,783 --> 00:17:58,535
As a result of a total inspection
of toilet paper

280
00:17:58,619 --> 00:18:00,245
produced in this country,

281
00:18:00,662 --> 00:18:02,289
large amounts of
a fluorescent whitening agent

282
00:18:02,372 --> 00:18:03,832
was only found in Daesung Pulp's paper,

283
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:05,084
which has shocked the country.

284
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:06,585
Reporter Ki-ryang Park.

285
00:18:07,461 --> 00:18:08,837
Are you all right?

286
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:10,798
Tell A-jin to come home. I need A-jin.

287
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:13,300
Then, I'll go forward
with the lawsuit right away.

288
00:18:13,675 --> 00:18:15,260
I'll need a list
of your possessions, first.

289
00:18:15,803 --> 00:18:17,262
Thank you for your help in advance.

290
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:19,181
No problem. I'll do my best.

291
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:22,559
You'll come out to this week's
meditation class, right?

292
00:18:23,644 --> 00:18:25,771
-I'm not sure.
-At a time like this,

293
00:18:25,854 --> 00:18:28,065
you really need it. Please come out.

294
00:18:29,566 --> 00:18:31,276
Okay, I will.

295
00:18:41,662 --> 00:18:43,330
-Hello?
-Where are you right now?

296
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:44,998
Why? What's the matter?

297
00:18:45,332 --> 00:18:46,208
Goodness.

298
00:18:46,667 --> 00:18:47,876
Haven't you seen the news?

299
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:50,629
Your father wants to see you right now.

300
00:18:51,421 --> 00:18:52,256
Come home.

301
00:18:58,303 --> 00:19:01,723
A reexamination
of the Korean toilet paper company

302
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:05,310
uncovered more fluorescent material...

303
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:09,439
What's the matter?

304
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:11,692
I need to get going.

305
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:14,027
Goodbye.

306
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:19,700
-Mr. Kang.
-Yes?

307
00:19:20,325 --> 00:19:22,536
She's really pretty, isn't she?

308
00:19:24,413 --> 00:19:25,539
Yes, I guess so.

309
00:19:26,123 --> 00:19:26,999
Are you interested?

310
00:19:27,499 --> 00:19:29,877
No way, she's a married woman.

311
00:19:31,211 --> 00:19:35,174
Although, she might be single very soon.

312
00:19:40,137 --> 00:19:41,889
Fluorescent whitening agents
are a chemical agents

313
00:19:41,972 --> 00:19:44,683
used to make toilet look white and clean.

314
00:19:45,058 --> 00:19:47,186
But it is known to be
a cancer-causing agent

315
00:19:47,269 --> 00:19:49,813
depending on the person's immune system.

316
00:19:50,147 --> 00:19:52,608
A-jin, what do you think we should do?

317
00:19:53,442 --> 00:19:55,569
We need to resolve one problem
at a time, Father.

318
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:59,573
Regenerated pulp is a raw material
that all companies have always used.

319
00:20:00,282 --> 00:20:03,660
That's because the unit price is low
and it's known to be a recycled resource.

320
00:20:04,453 --> 00:20:06,872
However, as the brightening
agent controversy arose,

321
00:20:07,331 --> 00:20:09,291
everyone else switched to a natural pulp,

322
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:12,211
while Daesung Pulp
handled it complacently.

323
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:15,756
What are our alternatives?

324
00:20:15,923 --> 00:20:19,885
Taking the blow and giving
an honest apology is the best way.

325
00:20:20,594 --> 00:20:23,055
We were too devoted to our goal
of providing affordable toilet paper

326
00:20:23,388 --> 00:20:26,308
to relieve our consumers'
financial burden,

327
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:29,394
so we inevitably continued
to use regenerated pulp

328
00:20:29,478 --> 00:20:31,438
in order to lower the unit price.

329
00:20:32,314 --> 00:20:35,150
We failed to notice that harmful
materials could be detected,

330
00:20:35,525 --> 00:20:38,779
and we were unable to notify our
consumers about it, so we're very sorry.

331
00:20:39,112 --> 00:20:42,366
We didn't fail to notify
our consumers on purpose,

332
00:20:42,449 --> 00:20:45,577
but it happened in the process
of swapping out our package design.

333
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:49,122
We're very sorry. Is that enough?

334
00:20:49,539 --> 00:20:51,416
Yes, that's enough.

335
00:20:52,292 --> 00:20:53,293
Gosh.

336
00:20:53,794 --> 00:20:56,922
I can't believe this is how
Jae-seok did his job.

337
00:20:58,548 --> 00:21:01,760
But, will that calm down the situation?

338
00:21:02,219 --> 00:21:05,264
Admit defeat, even if that
leads to a loss, Father.

339
00:21:05,597 --> 00:21:06,723
That's the only way to survive.

340
00:21:07,015 --> 00:21:10,519
We can't do anything about used products
due to the nature of the product,

341
00:21:10,602 --> 00:21:12,813
but we need to allow exchanges
or refunds for unopened products,

342
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:15,357
and calm down our consumers.

343
00:21:16,191 --> 00:21:19,111
First, make it so that they can
exchange or return their products

344
00:21:19,194 --> 00:21:21,405
even if they don't have their receipts.

345
00:21:21,655 --> 00:21:24,616
Okay, go ahead and handle that.

346
00:21:25,492 --> 00:21:28,912
This isn't something
I should trust Jae-seok with.

347
00:21:29,162 --> 00:21:31,164
No, I won't do that.

348
00:21:31,873 --> 00:21:34,084
I will no longer intervene
in company matters.

349
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:36,128
-A-jin.
-I'm

350
00:21:37,004 --> 00:21:38,297
going to divorce Jae-seok Ahn.

351
00:21:40,424 --> 00:21:44,177
You can't. I'll apologize on his behalf,
so don't divorce him.

352
00:21:44,845 --> 00:21:47,597
If you endure it for a little longer,
Jae-seok will come around.

353
00:21:47,889 --> 00:21:50,392
That punk does foolish things
from time to time.

354
00:21:50,892 --> 00:21:54,646
No, I want to respect my worth.

355
00:21:55,605 --> 00:21:58,817
I'm too good to live with that man.

356
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:05,282
I'll kick Jae-seok out of
my company, and give you

357
00:22:05,407 --> 00:22:07,617
all of his shares.
I'll put you in his position.

358
00:22:08,285 --> 00:22:09,286
Will you still divorce him?

359
00:22:11,288 --> 00:22:13,540
That's a really tempting offer.

360
00:22:14,624 --> 00:22:15,959
But, Father,

361
00:22:16,918 --> 00:22:21,006
if that offer is only valid as long as
I stay married to Jae-seok Ahn,

362
00:22:22,049 --> 00:22:23,675
I'll turn down that offer.

363
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,443
Mr. Chairman.

364
00:22:44,321 --> 00:22:46,615
I'll try to step up this time.

365
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:53,622
I think you weighed the seriousness
of your marriage differently.

366
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:57,626
It sounds like your husband, Jae-seok Ahn

367
00:22:57,709 --> 00:22:59,294
took your marriage lightly.

368
00:22:59,961 --> 00:23:03,340
He probably just viewed it as a sensual
union between a man and a woman.

369
00:23:03,924 --> 00:23:06,510
I bet his goal was to marry and have
babies with the woman who excites him

370
00:23:06,593 --> 00:23:08,804
and then live his life however he wanted.

371
00:23:10,138 --> 00:23:14,059
But for you, marriage
means a lot more than that.

372
00:23:15,185 --> 00:23:17,354
Responsibility, solidarity, and promise.

373
00:23:17,896 --> 00:23:19,856
You viewed marriage to hold such meanings.

374
00:23:22,692 --> 00:23:23,777
The seriousness of marriage?

375
00:23:25,695 --> 00:23:26,947
The seriousness of marriage...

376
00:23:40,168 --> 00:23:44,631
A SHARED OWNERSHIP AND TAKEOVER
CONTRACT OF PRIVATE ACADEMY

377
00:23:51,888 --> 00:23:55,725
A CERTIFIED REGISTER OF BUILDINGS
UNDER POSSESSION

378
00:24:03,024 --> 00:24:03,859
Honey.

379
00:24:05,318 --> 00:24:08,655
Wipe that frown off your face.
I told you not to worry too much.

380
00:24:09,573 --> 00:24:13,326
My face feels hot at the thought
of apologizing to the press.

381
00:24:14,578 --> 00:24:18,039
If you really don't want to do it, I will.

382
00:24:20,375 --> 00:24:24,296
I'm technically a director now, too.

383
00:24:26,089 --> 00:24:27,299
Are you saying you'll do it?

384
00:24:27,883 --> 00:24:29,050
I'm just saying,

385
00:24:29,259 --> 00:24:32,137
it'd look sincerer if I stepped up

386
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:35,557
rather than making those laughable
members speak in your stead.

387
00:24:36,016 --> 00:24:37,976
There's no reason why I can't do it.

388
00:24:38,393 --> 00:24:40,812
It's not like we can make
A-jin do it, right?

389
00:24:41,354 --> 00:24:43,523
Your steps are a little shaky today, too,

390
00:24:43,607 --> 00:24:47,110
so if you step up, they'll probably
say you're putting on a show.

391
00:24:48,236 --> 00:24:49,154
You're right.

392
00:24:50,488 --> 00:24:52,407
Trust me with this.

393
00:24:54,117 --> 00:24:56,369
And for my business card,

394
00:24:56,912 --> 00:25:00,165
I changed my name to Ji-yeong Park.

395
00:25:04,878 --> 00:25:07,714
I think I'll use this opportunity
to change my name.

396
00:25:08,506 --> 00:25:11,343
Why? I like "Bok-ja Park."

397
00:25:25,273 --> 00:25:26,900
Please continue to update me

398
00:25:27,317 --> 00:25:29,736
on everything Mr. Chairman does. Okay?

399
00:25:30,153 --> 00:25:31,196
Of course, ma'am.

400
00:25:41,706 --> 00:25:42,582
A-jin!

401
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:46,962
I'll give you a few more tips.

402
00:25:48,964 --> 00:25:51,341
I'll give you a list of the most
influential media outlets.

403
00:25:51,967 --> 00:25:53,468
It'll include a list of reporters.

404
00:25:54,094 --> 00:25:55,637
I'll notify the company's PR department.

405
00:25:56,346 --> 00:25:57,889
Meet them privately.

406
00:25:58,390 --> 00:25:59,432
And do what?

407
00:25:59,599 --> 00:26:01,309
Give them an unexpected gift.

408
00:26:02,227 --> 00:26:04,062
A gift that can move their hearts.

409
00:26:05,689 --> 00:26:06,564
A gift?

410
00:26:10,402 --> 00:26:12,779
It shouldn't conflict with the law
in any major way.

411
00:26:13,029 --> 00:26:14,781
Just tell them it's kimchi
that you made yourself.

412
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:16,908
How much could that possibly cost?

413
00:26:16,992 --> 00:26:19,077
The radish was grown in your
vegetable garden, so it's free.

414
00:26:19,244 --> 00:26:21,413
It's chili powder, salt, and fish
sauce at the most.

415
00:26:22,038 --> 00:26:23,832
But the production line
is the most urgent.

416
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:27,961
You must switch to natural pulp
from regenerated pulp

417
00:26:28,044 --> 00:26:30,380
even if you have to raise
the unit price of the raw materials.

418
00:26:30,797 --> 00:26:33,258
And you must come up with a strategy
to produce high-quality products.

419
00:26:33,883 --> 00:26:36,928
A reformation of the company's
bad image is the most urgent.

420
00:26:38,263 --> 00:26:39,639
I got it, but

421
00:26:40,473 --> 00:26:43,977
why are you helping me
if you're getting divorced?

422
00:26:45,145 --> 00:26:46,855
Because it's Ji-hu's
grandfather's company.

423
00:26:49,065 --> 00:26:50,317
I'll get going now.

424
00:26:51,109 --> 00:26:52,736
I trust that my advice was helpful.

425
00:27:15,508 --> 00:27:17,010
-We'll continue this later.
-Okay.

426
00:27:18,678 --> 00:27:21,598
I have something to tell you
before we begin our meditation.

427
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:26,478
I'm going to close down the academy
at the end of this month.

428
00:27:29,689 --> 00:27:32,233
This is what I've expected.

429
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:36,613
I started the most sensitive
education business

430
00:27:36,696 --> 00:27:39,199
in the most special area of Gangnam.

431
00:27:40,075 --> 00:27:43,453
As a result of running this academy
with a view that Gangnam is against,

432
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:46,373
I was ostracized by the parents.

433
00:27:48,416 --> 00:27:50,502
But if I could turn back time,

434
00:27:50,794 --> 00:27:52,253
I would have made the same decision.

435
00:27:53,922 --> 00:27:54,923
I don't regret it.

436
00:27:57,175 --> 00:27:59,803
Mr. Kang's meditation topic for today

437
00:27:59,886 --> 00:28:02,222
is called "Beautiful Failure,"

438
00:28:02,472 --> 00:28:04,808
and that made me wonder

439
00:28:04,891 --> 00:28:08,353
if he came here with this topic
because he knew about my situation.

440
00:28:13,441 --> 00:28:16,027
I don't think all failures

441
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:18,738
are bad.

442
00:28:20,657 --> 00:28:23,660
At times, a hurdle lies
in front of the door to happiness

443
00:28:25,078 --> 00:28:27,163
in the form of failure.

444
00:28:29,541 --> 00:28:32,293
Even though I failed
my academy business...

445
00:28:34,087 --> 00:28:37,424
I realized I'm living properly
without fading away.

446
00:28:37,966 --> 00:28:41,177
I actually ended up reflecting
upon my life, so my self-esteem

447
00:28:41,261 --> 00:28:42,303
has improved.

448
00:28:57,068 --> 00:28:57,944
Goodness.

449
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:01,197
It looks like I ended up
leading the class.

450
00:29:03,032 --> 00:29:05,326
Keep going. I'll let you
lead the class today.

451
00:29:06,619 --> 00:29:08,079
No. I shouldn't do that.

452
00:29:09,914 --> 00:29:12,083
Okay, that's how I failed.

453
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:13,793
I ask for your applause.

454
00:29:15,712 --> 00:29:17,630
I love you.

455
00:29:18,465 --> 00:29:19,632
I love you.

456
00:29:24,095 --> 00:29:25,305
We love you, too!

457
00:29:34,439 --> 00:29:37,692
DAESUNG PULP
POWER EMBOSSING THREE LAYER ROLL

458
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:49,078
It's a relief that an article came out

459
00:29:49,162 --> 00:29:52,707
about sanitary pads being
harmless to humans.

460
00:29:53,917 --> 00:29:54,834
Mr. Park.

461
00:29:56,002 --> 00:29:56,878
Yes?

462
00:29:59,964 --> 00:30:00,924
I'm sad.

463
00:30:03,551 --> 00:30:04,594
In the end,

464
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:06,888
my wife

465
00:30:07,889 --> 00:30:09,599
wants to file for divorce.

466
00:30:15,146 --> 00:30:16,314
Is my sunshine

467
00:30:17,357 --> 00:30:19,442
really leaving me like this?

468
00:30:25,615 --> 00:30:27,909
Why are we so busy all of a sudden?

469
00:30:28,451 --> 00:30:30,078
This is a special order for Daesung Pulp.

470
00:30:30,203 --> 00:30:32,038
You'll pay us a lot for this, right?

471
00:30:32,622 --> 00:30:34,040
Of course.

472
00:30:44,008 --> 00:30:46,719
I wonder what's in that extract.

473
00:30:46,928 --> 00:30:48,179
I know, right?

474
00:30:53,226 --> 00:30:54,102
A-jin.

475
00:30:54,561 --> 00:30:56,729
Didn't the cleaning lady
come to work today?

476
00:30:56,855 --> 00:30:58,731
No, I told her not to come.

477
00:30:59,148 --> 00:31:01,192
-Why?
-Just because.

478
00:31:01,276 --> 00:31:03,820
I'm sure she needs some time off.
Do you need a vacation, too?

479
00:31:07,991 --> 00:31:10,243
Work is a sacred thing, don't you think?

480
00:31:11,578 --> 00:31:13,037
I even cleaned the washroom earlier.

481
00:31:14,831 --> 00:31:17,083
Should we order a late-night
snack? Jokbal.

482
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:18,668
I'm in!

483
00:31:23,673 --> 00:31:25,758
About that pattern on the ceiling...

484
00:31:27,468 --> 00:31:30,555
Is that a baroque style or a rococo style?

485
00:31:32,765 --> 00:31:35,768
A-jin told me about it
when she picked it out

486
00:31:35,852 --> 00:31:37,020
but I can't remember.

487
00:31:43,234 --> 00:31:45,153
Don't get annoyed.

488
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:48,990
I'm having a hard time, too.

489
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:05,274
We received a report.

490
00:33:05,358 --> 00:33:06,567
This wasn't arson.

491
00:33:07,318 --> 00:33:08,486
I'll clean it up.

492
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:09,821
It's hard to burn anything

493
00:33:09,904 --> 00:33:12,115
because of Gangnam's floor area ratio
and price of land.

494
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:13,783
But you can't do this.

495
00:33:18,788 --> 00:33:20,498
It's not like I can burn
my husband, right?

496
00:33:30,842 --> 00:33:31,968
Let's meet tomorrow.

497
00:33:33,469 --> 00:33:36,472
"What for?" Are we not
allowed to see each other?

498
00:33:37,265 --> 00:33:38,599
You said it yourself.

499
00:33:38,975 --> 00:33:41,936
You said I paid you to do
something about Bok-ja Park.

500
00:33:43,938 --> 00:33:44,814
Let's meet.

501
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:48,943
I'll decide on the location
and text you tomorrow.

502
00:33:57,660 --> 00:33:59,662
-Ju-mi.
-Don't.

503
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:04,584
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

504
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:07,170
I'll go back to America.

505
00:34:08,379 --> 00:34:11,883
Don't go. Claim what belongs
to you and Un-gyu, first.

506
00:34:12,216 --> 00:34:14,218
You can't back down. We are

507
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:16,512
on the edge of a cliff right now.

508
00:34:16,637 --> 00:34:18,097
It's all useless.

509
00:34:18,264 --> 00:34:21,392
No, if you can't do that,
do something before you go.

510
00:34:22,685 --> 00:34:24,062
-Like what?
-At least...

511
00:34:26,105 --> 00:34:27,565
kill that woman before you go.

512
00:35:00,264 --> 00:35:01,641
I'll have to break up our team, right?

513
00:35:04,602 --> 00:35:06,771
Just do it with Su-min and Jeong-hyeon.

514
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:08,856
Will you do that?

515
00:35:10,149 --> 00:35:11,025
I have to.

516
00:35:12,318 --> 00:35:13,152
Hey.

517
00:35:14,153 --> 00:35:15,780
What should I do?

518
00:35:16,697 --> 00:35:17,698
Gi-ok.

519
00:35:18,074 --> 00:35:21,536
I feel so sorry for our Jeong-woo.

520
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:26,124
What if...

521
00:35:27,208 --> 00:35:29,085
What if that child is really my husband's?

522
00:35:30,378 --> 00:35:31,420
No way.

523
00:35:31,504 --> 00:35:33,339
She probably wasn't careful
because she's infertile.

524
00:35:33,464 --> 00:35:35,133
She doesn't even know whose it is.

525
00:35:36,175 --> 00:35:38,719
Gosh! I'm so disgusted.

526
00:35:43,057 --> 00:35:45,184
Gi-ok, abandon your husband.

527
00:35:46,853 --> 00:35:48,187
I'm not telling you to divorce him.

528
00:35:49,522 --> 00:35:50,439
Just

529
00:35:51,983 --> 00:35:53,234
abandon all feelings for him.

530
00:35:55,361 --> 00:35:58,364
I can't abandon my husband.

531
00:36:00,408 --> 00:36:03,494
I can't get rid of my lingering
attachment to him.

532
00:36:09,417 --> 00:36:11,460
J TOP PLASTIC SURGERY

533
00:36:15,423 --> 00:36:17,425
-Ms. Jung.
-Yes?

534
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:18,843
Can we talk?

535
00:36:23,681 --> 00:36:25,266
Don't worry.
Dr. Jang doesn't know I'm here.

536
00:36:26,142 --> 00:36:28,102
-Okay.
-I want to ask you a favor.

537
00:36:28,978 --> 00:36:31,939
You know the text you sent me
with an anonymous number?

538
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:34,192
How did you do that?
How do you send those?

539
00:36:34,775 --> 00:36:37,111
I did that on the internet.

540
00:36:37,987 --> 00:36:39,030
Teach me how.

541
00:36:40,489 --> 00:36:41,741
Seong-hui!

542
00:36:42,992 --> 00:36:44,577
-Are you here?
-Yeah.

543
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:49,332
Oh my, what a nice house.
Where's my son-in-law?

544
00:36:49,957 --> 00:36:51,667
What? Your son-in-law?

545
00:36:52,126 --> 00:36:53,377
Aren't you going to introduce me?

546
00:36:54,503 --> 00:36:56,839
Did you do what I told you to do?

547
00:36:57,965 --> 00:37:00,009
-What?
-The ownership of this house!

548
00:37:00,092 --> 00:37:02,136
I told you to change it
to your name. Did you do that?

549
00:37:03,804 --> 00:37:04,972
I did.

550
00:37:06,682 --> 00:37:08,976
How could you let that lady do that?

551
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:11,687
Shut up, you punk!
Then should it have been you or me?

552
00:37:11,979 --> 00:37:14,148
You should have told A-jin
to do it instead!

553
00:37:15,191 --> 00:37:17,526
A-jin said she wouldn't do it!
She said she's going to divorce you!

554
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:19,320
She wouldn't do it no matter
what I offered her!

555
00:37:19,695 --> 00:37:21,572
You've become worthless,
you son of a bitch!

556
00:37:28,579 --> 00:37:30,373
DAESUNG PULP PRESS CONFERENCE

557
00:37:30,456 --> 00:37:33,376
Hello, I'm the vice-chairwoman
of Daesung Pulp,

558
00:37:33,668 --> 00:37:35,253
Ji-yeong Park.

559
00:37:35,461 --> 00:37:37,588
Wait, what does she mean,
she's the vice-chairwoman?

560
00:37:37,672 --> 00:37:38,756
Shut up.

561
00:37:39,674 --> 00:37:40,800
Who the heck is Ji-yeong Park?

562
00:37:41,133 --> 00:37:42,677
DAESUNG PULP PRESS CONFERENCE

563
00:37:49,725 --> 00:37:52,353
At Daesung Pulp we realized our mistakes,

564
00:37:52,561 --> 00:37:54,897
recalled the problematic products,

565
00:37:54,981 --> 00:37:58,109
put all the production lines
in operation since the 13th,

566
00:37:58,359 --> 00:38:01,529
and we're currently producing
high-quality products

567
00:38:01,612 --> 00:38:03,990
that only contain harmless, natural pulp.

568
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:25,636
As you can see,

569
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:28,389
Daesung Pulp's toilet paper

570
00:38:29,807 --> 00:38:31,851
is now harmless, even when swallowed.

571
00:38:38,941 --> 00:38:40,484
From now on, Daesung Pulp

572
00:38:40,568 --> 00:38:45,740
will only increase the production
of products that you can trust

573
00:38:46,157 --> 00:38:47,533
and safely use.

574
00:38:48,242 --> 00:38:50,828
Also, we will disregard profit

575
00:38:51,037 --> 00:38:54,623
and declare that we decreased
the price as much as possible

576
00:38:54,915 --> 00:38:57,585
for our consumers.

577
00:39:18,064 --> 00:39:20,358
I made this kimchi myself.

578
00:39:20,608 --> 00:39:23,611
Eat this with ramen
when you work overtime.

579
00:39:23,736 --> 00:39:26,489
I'm speechless. Why did she give me this?

580
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:13,119
ORDER DRAFT

581
00:40:13,994 --> 00:40:16,038
It'll be difficult to produce
this much in the given time.

582
00:40:16,122 --> 00:40:19,792
We've been pulling triple shifts for days
after changing the raw material.

583
00:40:20,084 --> 00:40:22,044
All of our employees
have been complaining.

584
00:40:22,169 --> 00:40:24,588
They'll all quit at this rate!

585
00:40:24,755 --> 00:40:27,633
If we don't replace the stock
with new products within the given time,

586
00:40:27,842 --> 00:40:30,678
our distributors
will turn their backs on us as well.

587
00:40:31,929 --> 00:40:35,015
You must meet the deadline no matter what.

588
00:40:36,308 --> 00:40:38,060
And, Sir.

589
00:40:38,602 --> 00:40:42,064
Do you have an extra work uniform?

590
00:40:49,238 --> 00:40:50,239
Everyone.

591
00:40:51,323 --> 00:40:54,785
I'm well aware that you're all
having a hard time.

592
00:40:55,661 --> 00:40:58,664
I ask that you get through this crisis.

593
00:40:59,123 --> 00:41:01,000
By helping us save our company,

594
00:41:01,208 --> 00:41:03,461
you're also saving yourselves.

595
00:41:04,795 --> 00:41:07,381
Before I'm a family member

596
00:41:07,465 --> 00:41:10,176
of the company owner, who is
responsible for its employees' families,

597
00:41:10,509 --> 00:41:13,220
I'm your colleague,

598
00:41:13,304 --> 00:41:16,265
who can't give up on your lives like this.

599
00:41:17,516 --> 00:41:21,061
If the company tumbles down,
your lives will tumble down, too.

600
00:41:23,272 --> 00:41:26,150
We can't just let that happen.

601
00:41:28,444 --> 00:41:32,490
I'll be with you until the very end.

602
00:41:58,349 --> 00:41:59,475
It's Mr. Chairman.

603
00:42:00,935 --> 00:42:03,062
Bok-ja, you worked hard.

604
00:42:03,479 --> 00:42:05,272
You did enough, so come back home.

605
00:42:05,523 --> 00:42:07,983
I think I should stay the night here

606
00:42:08,067 --> 00:42:09,902
if we want this factory to run smoothly.

607
00:42:11,654 --> 00:42:14,990
I don't mind doing
this kind of work at a factory.

608
00:42:15,491 --> 00:42:18,327
Don't worry and get some rest, okay?

609
00:42:18,827 --> 00:42:20,162
I'm hanging up.

610
00:42:24,917 --> 00:42:26,502
Bong-sik, nice shot!

611
00:42:33,133 --> 00:42:34,927
Blocked caller ID
Your wife is pregnant.

612
00:42:41,225 --> 00:42:42,268
Hey, you.

613
00:42:44,061 --> 00:42:45,312
Yes, Sir.

614
00:42:46,814 --> 00:42:49,066
Are you really working for me?

615
00:42:50,943 --> 00:42:51,902
Of course.

616
00:42:54,822 --> 00:42:56,073
I can't trust you.

617
00:42:58,033 --> 00:43:00,995
If I ever find out that you're not...

618
00:43:01,662 --> 00:43:03,289
I'll bury you alive.

619
00:43:04,832 --> 00:43:05,708
Yes, Sir.

620
00:43:07,668 --> 00:43:08,752
Is he still seeing her?

621
00:43:09,044 --> 00:43:11,213
No, he hasn't come by after what happened.

622
00:43:11,839 --> 00:43:14,633
What did you say that bastard's name is?

623
00:43:15,009 --> 00:43:16,010
Gi-seok Choi.

624
00:43:17,052 --> 00:43:19,680
I'm thinking of getting
someone to follow him.

625
00:43:20,681 --> 00:43:22,224
I have a weird feeling about those two.

626
00:43:23,767 --> 00:43:26,729
I put a lot of things under my wife's name

627
00:43:26,812 --> 00:43:28,606
because of tax issues.

628
00:43:29,565 --> 00:43:31,442
So she spends my money however she wants.

629
00:43:33,193 --> 00:43:36,405
If she ever gives that young kid anything

630
00:43:36,947 --> 00:43:38,073
we'll be in quite a predicament.

631
00:43:38,949 --> 00:43:41,952
Do you want to follow
him around for the time being?

632
00:43:43,871 --> 00:43:45,831
If that's what you'd like me
to do, I'll do it.

633
00:43:46,373 --> 00:43:48,000
-Hyo-ju.
-Yeah?

634
00:43:48,584 --> 00:43:50,461
Buy me a house.

635
00:43:52,588 --> 00:43:53,547
A house?

636
00:43:54,173 --> 00:43:57,468
Yeah, a house where we can spend time
comfortably together.

637
00:44:00,054 --> 00:44:03,807
My friend who's dating the wife of Jinan
Group got a three-billion-won apartment.

638
00:44:07,603 --> 00:44:08,604
You...

639
00:44:15,361 --> 00:44:17,529
He said, ever since
he started living with her

640
00:44:18,197 --> 00:44:21,283
he started to really
fall in love with her.

641
00:44:26,497 --> 00:44:27,539
I'm off.

642
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:43,472
There's really nothing wrong, right?

643
00:44:44,431 --> 00:44:46,433
I told you nothing's wrong, Mom.

644
00:44:46,934 --> 00:44:48,560
I saw the news yesterday.

645
00:44:48,644 --> 00:44:50,938
Why did that woman speak
at your company's press conference?

646
00:44:51,772 --> 00:44:52,773
Why does it matter?

647
00:44:54,983 --> 00:44:56,735
What do you mean, "why does it matter?"

648
00:44:56,985 --> 00:44:59,363
Why did that woman do it
if Jae-seok is there?

649
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:02,783
After I saw that,
I couldn't sleep a wink that night.

650
00:45:02,950 --> 00:45:04,159
I felt so upset.

651
00:45:04,952 --> 00:45:05,911
Mom, I'm moving.

652
00:45:06,745 --> 00:45:09,873
UN Top Village?
The one you bought before, right?

653
00:45:10,249 --> 00:45:11,083
Yeah.

654
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:13,836
That's under Jae-seok's name, isn't it?

655
00:45:14,336 --> 00:45:15,170
Yeah.

656
00:45:15,629 --> 00:45:18,090
If possible, put it under your name.

657
00:45:29,476 --> 00:45:30,644
Ms. Ji-yeong Park?

658
00:45:32,187 --> 00:45:33,272
Ms. Ji-yeong Park?

659
00:45:35,023 --> 00:45:37,401
Right. I'm Ji-yeong Park. Yes?

660
00:45:37,526 --> 00:45:39,903
I was very impressed with
your press conference last time.

661
00:45:41,405 --> 00:45:42,364
Were you?

662
00:45:42,448 --> 00:45:44,199
You're having a hard time
in many ways, aren't you?

663
00:45:45,367 --> 00:45:47,119
Well, as you probably you know...

664
00:45:48,162 --> 00:45:49,746
What are colleagues for?

665
00:45:50,247 --> 00:45:53,709
If you need any help, let me know.
I can be your drinking buddy if you want.

666
00:45:54,751 --> 00:45:56,837
Speaking of which,
would you like to go for a drink?

667
00:46:10,142 --> 00:46:13,395
UN TOP VILLAGE
OWNER: SEONG-HUI YUN

668
00:46:23,405 --> 00:46:24,490
A-jin!

669
00:46:26,867 --> 00:46:27,826
Jeez.

670
00:46:29,536 --> 00:46:32,581
Something's wrong. I'm sure of it.

671
00:46:57,773 --> 00:46:58,857
Hello?

672
00:46:59,483 --> 00:47:02,152
Did you put that house
under that bitch's name?

673
00:47:03,987 --> 00:47:07,449
Yeah, it turned out that way.

674
00:47:08,575 --> 00:47:11,787
You're completely hopeless!

675
00:47:12,204 --> 00:47:14,831
A-jin! I'm not going to divorce you!

676
00:47:20,170 --> 00:47:21,380
This is a total mess.

677
00:47:21,922 --> 00:47:24,800
He transferred the ownership
right before your divorce proceedings?

678
00:47:25,384 --> 00:47:27,344
This can be considered a fraudulent act.

679
00:47:27,844 --> 00:47:31,348
Then we need to sue him for both
the fraudulence and alimony.

680
00:47:33,058 --> 00:47:34,601
Let's do that. Yes.

681
00:47:36,186 --> 00:47:37,312
Hang in there.

682
00:47:39,189 --> 00:47:41,275
Jeez. He's a really bad guy.

683
00:48:06,508 --> 00:48:07,384
You're here.

684
00:48:10,137 --> 00:48:12,389
We also met at this cafe

685
00:48:12,848 --> 00:48:14,224
when I hired you for the job, right?

686
00:48:16,518 --> 00:48:19,980
If I hired you for a job,
shouldn't you keep it a secret?

687
00:48:21,565 --> 00:48:23,025
How much did I pay you again?

688
00:48:24,151 --> 00:48:25,527
I don't remember.

689
00:48:26,653 --> 00:48:28,822
Tell me. How much did I pay you?

690
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:34,369
Didn't I give you one hundred million won?

691
00:48:35,537 --> 00:48:37,456
I clearly remember it.

692
00:48:37,789 --> 00:48:39,374
I paid you one hundred
million won in cash.

693
00:48:40,334 --> 00:48:41,418
Don't you remember that?

694
00:48:43,587 --> 00:48:44,504
I...

695
00:48:47,424 --> 00:48:48,634
-remember.
-I want it back.

696
00:48:50,093 --> 00:48:51,178
You failed, though.

697
00:48:52,387 --> 00:48:55,557
You said this when we talked last time.

698
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:58,143
You said you'll give it back if you fail.

699
00:49:00,604 --> 00:49:03,607
Ma'am, I'm sorry. Please stop.

700
00:49:04,149 --> 00:49:05,609
-Stop what?
-Stop it.

701
00:49:05,692 --> 00:49:07,527
Why are you doing this?
We've never met before.

702
00:49:07,903 --> 00:49:08,987
We've never met?

703
00:49:09,071 --> 00:49:11,782
When did you pay me? When did
we meet? Why are you doing this?

704
00:49:18,288 --> 00:49:20,082
-Stop what?
-Stop it.

705
00:49:20,165 --> 00:49:22,042
Why are you doing this? We've never met.

706
00:49:22,209 --> 00:49:24,544
-We've never met?
-When did you pay me?

707
00:49:24,628 --> 00:49:26,254
When did we meet? Why are you doing this?

708
00:49:31,385 --> 00:49:32,260
You...

709
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:36,098
Are you going to do as I ask?

710
00:50:00,122 --> 00:50:02,958
Hello? Bok-ja, it's me.

711
00:50:04,376 --> 00:50:05,335
What?

712
00:50:07,129 --> 00:50:09,131
Did that woman really contact you?

713
00:50:11,216 --> 00:50:12,426
You didn't say anything, right?

714
00:50:14,469 --> 00:50:17,097
You better not get entangled
in her scheme.

715
00:50:17,681 --> 00:50:20,600
Why would I get entangled in it? I won't.

716
00:50:22,310 --> 00:50:25,480
I'm just telling you I met up
with her. I'm hanging up.

717
00:51:01,016 --> 00:51:03,643
A-jin, you're just going to leave
Jae-hui's room, right?

718
00:51:03,810 --> 00:51:04,686
Yeah.

719
00:51:04,936 --> 00:51:06,855
-But where did Jae-hui go?
-She went to Jeju Island.

720
00:51:06,938 --> 00:51:07,856
Pardon?

721
00:51:07,939 --> 00:51:09,733
She went to pick up her clothes
for the new season.

722
00:51:10,233 --> 00:51:11,234
No one can stop her.

723
00:51:11,318 --> 00:51:14,946
Sir, those items are fragile,
so please wrap them up carefully.

724
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:21,328
And we're not taking those suitcases,
so you can leave them.

725
00:51:21,536 --> 00:51:22,370
Okay!

726
00:51:24,539 --> 00:51:27,334
-Finish this up for me.
-Don't worry.

727
00:51:27,417 --> 00:51:28,835
Our princess is doing well, right?

728
00:51:29,252 --> 00:51:30,420
Of course.

729
00:51:31,254 --> 00:51:32,547
-Ji-hu.
-Yes?

730
00:51:33,381 --> 00:51:35,717
Will you be okay going to
school from here?

731
00:51:35,801 --> 00:51:37,719
Won't it be difficult because it's so far?

732
00:51:38,428 --> 00:51:41,556
Jin-hee said she'll take me
to school every morning.

733
00:51:41,723 --> 00:51:42,933
I like Jin-hee.

734
00:51:44,017 --> 00:51:45,101
That's a relief.

735
00:51:45,602 --> 00:51:48,647
What do you want to eat?
I'll cook you something delicious.

736
00:51:50,357 --> 00:51:52,067
-Grandma.
-Yeah?

737
00:51:52,609 --> 00:51:54,945
Make me food that you used to
make Mom when she was my age.

738
00:51:55,153 --> 00:51:56,863
What did Mom like when she was ten?

739
00:51:57,864 --> 00:52:00,992
Your mom liked seasoned
bean sprouts at that age.

740
00:52:01,535 --> 00:52:04,955
I didn't have much money,
so I couldn't make much for her.

741
00:52:05,956 --> 00:52:07,499
Then, make that for me, too.

742
00:52:08,416 --> 00:52:09,751
-Why?
-Just because.

743
00:52:10,043 --> 00:52:12,212
I want to try what Mom used to eat.

744
00:52:12,754 --> 00:52:14,714
Then I'll grow up to be pretty,
just like Mom.

745
00:52:15,257 --> 00:52:19,135
Gosh, my baby. Who did you
take after to be so loveable?

746
00:52:19,427 --> 00:52:21,763
I took after Mom. Who else?

747
00:52:22,806 --> 00:52:24,516
Gosh, our puppy.

748
00:52:25,350 --> 00:52:27,727
Gosh. You're so loveable.

749
00:52:32,315 --> 00:52:36,611
DAESUNG PULP

750
00:53:06,808 --> 00:53:08,727
Wait, why am I bowing down to her?

751
00:53:09,644 --> 00:53:10,645
What the heck?

752
00:53:13,273 --> 00:53:14,357
A-jin!

753
00:53:16,776 --> 00:53:18,820
-Are my clothes and shoes here?
-Of course.

754
00:54:03,949 --> 00:54:04,950
Mom!

755
00:54:05,033 --> 00:54:08,703
Ji-hu, I need to pick up something,
so until then,

756
00:54:09,204 --> 00:54:10,288
hang in there, okay?

757
00:54:10,372 --> 00:54:12,874
-Don't worry.
-You're a brave girl.

758
00:54:13,375 --> 00:54:16,169
I'll call you later. Okay, I love you.

759
00:54:16,628 --> 00:54:17,754
I love you, too.

760
00:54:27,472 --> 00:54:29,057
What does Jae-seok like to eat?

761
00:54:29,766 --> 00:54:32,727
I won that man over with cheap food, Mom.

762
00:54:33,561 --> 00:54:35,230
Is it because
he ate fancy food all his life?

763
00:54:35,355 --> 00:54:37,107
He likes food from transport cafes.

764
00:54:37,482 --> 00:54:38,400
Really?

765
00:54:38,692 --> 00:54:41,194
Then should I show off
my cooking skills today?

766
00:54:41,319 --> 00:54:42,404
Go ahead.

767
00:54:48,326 --> 00:54:49,202
Jae-gu!

768
00:54:56,459 --> 00:54:58,545
Which room is Bok-ja Park in?

769
00:55:10,724 --> 00:55:14,686
MOVERS 24 EXPRESS

770
00:55:21,818 --> 00:55:24,112
Sir...

771
00:55:24,195 --> 00:55:25,280
Okay.

772
00:55:25,780 --> 00:55:27,073
It looks like someone's moving in.

773
00:55:27,407 --> 00:55:28,241
Yeah.

774
00:55:30,910 --> 00:55:34,497
VICE-CHAIRWOMAN JI-YEONG PARK

775
00:55:54,559 --> 00:55:55,560
What is this?

776
00:56:03,985 --> 00:56:04,986
Hey, you bitch.

777
00:56:05,612 --> 00:56:07,947
I know why you came into our house.

778
00:56:08,782 --> 00:56:10,075
Are you looking down on me?

779
00:56:11,910 --> 00:56:14,412
Do you think you can just kick
my wife and child out of the house?

780
00:56:24,964 --> 00:56:27,092
"Vice-Chairwoman," my ass.

781
00:56:28,343 --> 00:56:30,261
Jae-gu! What are you doing?

782
00:56:31,429 --> 00:56:33,264
-Jae-gu, don't.
-Mark my words.

783
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:35,350
I'll kill this bitch today and go to jail.

784
00:56:35,683 --> 00:56:37,644
-Let go! Don't stop me!
-Try to kill me!

785
00:56:38,061 --> 00:56:39,104
Try to kill me.

786
00:56:39,312 --> 00:56:40,313
Go on!

787
00:56:40,772 --> 00:56:42,982
Kill me!

788
00:56:54,119 --> 00:56:55,370
What on earth are you doing?

789
00:56:56,037 --> 00:56:58,039
I'm here to claim my house back.

790
00:56:58,206 --> 00:57:00,959
This house is under my child's name.

791
00:57:01,126 --> 00:57:02,752
This isn't your house!

792
00:57:02,836 --> 00:57:05,713
I'm going to report you to the police
for unauthorized trespassing.

793
00:57:06,131 --> 00:57:09,092
Good idea. I was going to
do that. Go ahead.

794
00:57:20,562 --> 00:57:22,939
Life was truly a war.

795
00:57:23,648 --> 00:57:27,026
For those who longed for peace,
and for those who had thirst for desire,

796
00:57:27,902 --> 00:57:30,155
war was inevitable.

797
00:58:04,105 --> 00:58:06,483
I can't forgive that punk this time!

798
00:58:06,566 --> 00:58:08,568
I won't settle. Lock me up.

799
00:58:08,860 --> 00:58:12,030
You are no match for me.

800
00:58:12,155 --> 00:58:14,032
Let's see who wins.

801
00:58:14,365 --> 00:58:16,826
Take care of your imprisoned
husband for now.

802
00:58:17,494 --> 00:58:18,703
I'll protect our family.

803
00:58:18,786 --> 00:58:21,164
-Are you saying you'll break up with her?
-Not that.

804
00:58:21,539 --> 00:58:23,082
You crazy bastard!

805
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:27,003
My wife is pregnant. It's not my child.

806
00:58:27,253 --> 00:58:30,381
-Who's the father?
-Mind your own business.

807
00:58:30,757 --> 00:58:33,426
-Isn't she...
-I'll have someone follow her.

808
00:58:33,593 --> 00:58:36,930
Do you think it's yours because
it has your name on it?

809
00:58:38,223 --> 00:58:40,183
I'll punish you for not raising
your kid properly!

810
00:58:40,266 --> 00:58:41,976
-You shameless bitch.
-Hey!

811
00:58:43,436 --> 00:58:46,856
Coexistence is what you wanted.
How do you like it so far?

812
00:58:48,399 --> 00:58:51,653
Do you think Bok-ja Park
will take care of you forever?

813
00:58:51,736 --> 00:58:53,863
She will use you and abandon you.

814
00:58:53,947 --> 00:58:56,199
I wish you would find your own true life,

815
00:58:56,491 --> 00:58:57,951
and not harm anyone.

816
00:58:58,409 --> 00:59:01,746
I don't know who'll kill you,
but it'll happen sooner or later.

817
00:59:06,167 --> 00:59:08,169
