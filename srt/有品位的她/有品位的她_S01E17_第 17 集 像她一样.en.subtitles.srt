1
00:00:40,665 --> 00:00:43,418
I'm not going to wake up.

2
00:00:43,835 --> 00:00:47,547
Let's keep this as a secret between us.

3
00:00:48,047 --> 00:00:50,633
You should have died.
Why are you still alive?

4
00:00:50,925 --> 00:00:53,511
Didn't you think I'd prepare for this?

5
00:00:53,887 --> 00:00:54,971
On behalf of my father-in-law,

6
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:56,681
I'm going to sue you
to retrieve our shares.

7
00:00:56,890 --> 00:01:00,769
I think Mr. Han got his information
from this woman until now.

8
00:01:00,977 --> 00:01:02,771
How do you expect me
to prepare ten billion won?

9
00:01:02,854 --> 00:01:06,066
You can use Chairman Ahn's cash
or real estate property as a collateral

10
00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:07,567
and take a loan out from a bank.

11
00:01:07,817 --> 00:01:11,154
Who do you think will inherit the money
if that woman dies?

12
00:01:11,404 --> 00:01:14,324
Father will get it all back.
We must do it if it's the only way.

13
00:01:14,699 --> 00:01:17,744
I'm here to end you.

14
00:01:18,036 --> 00:01:19,829
An attacker has entered
Ms. Chairman's suite.

15
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:23,917
I just received a call from Bang-soon.
Apparently, Jae-gu can't be reached.

16
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:26,711
I think maybe

17
00:01:28,338 --> 00:01:30,048
you will end up dead.

18
00:01:41,559 --> 00:01:43,394
She forced me to do it.

19
00:01:44,103 --> 00:01:47,565
I gave Bok-ja
information about Mr. Chairman.

20
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,945
The goal was to seduce Mr. Chairman
and get something for ourselves.

21
00:01:58,034 --> 00:01:58,910
But

22
00:02:00,328 --> 00:02:01,746
she knew about you.

23
00:02:03,206 --> 00:02:05,208
Even before I told her about you,

24
00:02:06,751 --> 00:02:08,378
she knew your name.

25
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:23,518
You can never make it to the upper class.

26
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:26,354
Even though you have a lot of money,

27
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:28,898
you're nothing more than
a caregiver for the sick.

28
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:02,473
-Hello?
-I am looking for a caregiver.

29
00:03:05,268 --> 00:03:08,605
Just help him become more happy

30
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:10,064
and healthy.

31
00:03:10,732 --> 00:03:12,775
I will pay you more for that.

32
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:17,155
This is your opportunity
to repent your sins.

33
00:03:17,822 --> 00:03:19,574
Make everything right!

34
00:03:25,788 --> 00:03:26,831
But ma'am.

35
00:03:27,332 --> 00:03:28,791
Hiring a person is a big deal.

36
00:03:30,168 --> 00:03:32,462
You shouldn't be hiring people so easily.

37
00:03:35,798 --> 00:03:37,425
There must be some qualifications.

38
00:03:40,136 --> 00:03:43,723
A person who likes
Matisse and Kandinsky would be nice.

39
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:11,793
Who does she think I am?

40
00:04:16,297 --> 00:04:17,548
Who does she think I am?

41
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:35,024
What?

42
00:04:35,233 --> 00:04:36,985
Hey, come home.

43
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:38,778
Which one?

44
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:41,114
The one you used to live in, you punk.

45
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:04,262
Hey, Jin-hee. Is Ji-hu sleeping?

46
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:09,183
I'm going to drop by early
tomorrow morning.

47
00:05:10,393 --> 00:05:11,769
Yeah and Jin-hee,

48
00:05:12,061 --> 00:05:14,897
do you want to come by the gallery
tomorrow and have lunch with me?

49
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:18,109
Okay, see you tomorrow.

50
00:05:35,501 --> 00:05:36,586
Partner, what are you doing?

51
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:41,215
I'm reading a book of poetry.

52
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:43,926
I miss you.

53
00:05:48,514 --> 00:05:50,391
Haha

54
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,146
Funny.

55
00:05:55,229 --> 00:05:56,272
Were you taken aback?

56
00:06:00,651 --> 00:06:01,736
No way.

57
00:06:14,665 --> 00:06:17,293
-Hello?
-What's with your responses?

58
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:19,754
Have you eaten?

59
00:06:20,546 --> 00:06:22,965
We never progress past talking about food.

60
00:06:23,257 --> 00:06:26,135
Don't you have anything else to say
to me besides asking me if I've eaten?

61
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:30,348
I'll arrive in front of your house
in 30 minutes,

62
00:06:30,765 --> 00:06:31,849
so come out for a moment.

63
00:06:32,433 --> 00:06:33,559
Why so late at night?

64
00:06:34,102 --> 00:06:36,771
Why else? Because I miss you.

65
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:39,273
I have to see you at your office anyway.

66
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:41,442
That's tomorrow.

67
00:06:42,401 --> 00:06:46,030
I really need to see you today.
Come out, okay? I'm hanging up!

68
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:58,543
So, are you asking me for extra pay

69
00:06:58,626 --> 00:06:59,794
for how much you worked?

70
00:07:00,294 --> 00:07:01,504
That's right.

71
00:07:01,838 --> 00:07:04,549
Your brother made us work
and then ditched.

72
00:07:05,299 --> 00:07:07,718
Hey but our brother can't be reached.

73
00:07:08,553 --> 00:07:10,096
We're not asking for all of it.

74
00:07:10,179 --> 00:07:12,723
It's not even that much. Why are you
giving them a discount, you bastard?

75
00:07:12,974 --> 00:07:14,809
Why are you asking me for that money?

76
00:07:15,017 --> 00:07:16,811
If Jae-gu made you work,
you should get it from him!

77
00:07:16,978 --> 00:07:19,355
That's because I can't reach him!

78
00:07:19,647 --> 00:07:21,566
If I told you to pay off

79
00:07:21,649 --> 00:07:23,526
your brother's debt, would you do it?

80
00:07:23,901 --> 00:07:25,903
That's totally absurd!

81
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:27,155
In any case, I can't do it.

82
00:07:27,238 --> 00:07:29,824
Then we'll eat and sleep here

83
00:07:30,032 --> 00:07:31,993
until Jae-gu gets back.

84
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:33,661
Gosh, you're driving me crazy.

85
00:07:33,995 --> 00:07:35,455
Get out right now!

86
00:07:35,538 --> 00:07:36,497
No way.

87
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:39,375
How much money are you asking for?

88
00:07:41,002 --> 00:07:42,879
Ten million won for me
and five million won for him.

89
00:07:43,421 --> 00:07:45,631
What are you saying?
It's seven million won!

90
00:07:46,007 --> 00:07:47,925
Hey, you blockhead,
he owes you five million won!

91
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:49,969
In that case, he owes you
eight million won!

92
00:07:50,261 --> 00:07:52,054
Gosh, I might actually go crazy.

93
00:07:52,221 --> 00:07:55,725
But Jae-hui, I heard you go crazy on the
phone about a way to save the company.

94
00:07:55,933 --> 00:07:58,519
-What was that about?
-Forget it. It's none of your business.

95
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:01,939
Jeez. I don't know. I'm going home.

96
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:04,275
Hey, give me some money first.

97
00:08:04,358 --> 00:08:06,444
And pay these people and make them leave.

98
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:09,655
You have a company account!
That's what Mr. Oh said.

99
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:13,451
He said Father didn't cancel your
company card or your monthly pay.

100
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:16,037
I have to support my family.

101
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,747
And I don't have money
to give these punks!

102
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:19,790
At least give me ten million won!

103
00:08:19,874 --> 00:08:21,959
Jae-hui, have you even visited
Father at the hospital?

104
00:08:22,293 --> 00:08:25,588
Why would I go there? I would have
kicked him if he wasn't my dad.

105
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:28,382
The old man is unconscious.

106
00:08:28,466 --> 00:08:32,220
Don't think about spending money
and pray that Father wakes up first.

107
00:08:32,303 --> 00:08:33,304
Damn it!

108
00:08:33,471 --> 00:08:35,556
I have to catch that wench
and torture her.

109
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:37,016
Where's that lady right now?

110
00:08:37,099 --> 00:08:40,019
Where else? She's in her
Saint Palace suite room.

111
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:43,147
Why is she there of all places?

112
00:08:43,773 --> 00:08:47,443
That's where I had my wedding anniversary.

113
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:50,154
Are you really able to say stuff
like that in this situation?

114
00:08:50,404 --> 00:08:52,990
In that sense,
you're a very sensitive person.

115
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:55,201
I'm lonelier than I've ever been.

116
00:08:55,952 --> 00:08:58,871
I don't have any earthling friends
to interchange feelings with.

117
00:08:59,163 --> 00:09:01,666
Good for you. Go back to Mars.

118
00:09:01,749 --> 00:09:04,418
I'd actually be willing
if there's a pretty woman there.

119
00:09:04,502 --> 00:09:05,378
Crazy bastard.

120
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:08,256
But where did Jae-gu go?

121
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:17,515
I am looking for a caregiver.

122
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:21,394
A person who likes
Matisse and Kandinsky would be nice.

123
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,320
NEW MESSAGE, A-JIN WOO

124
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:33,906
I'm no longer a caregiver

125
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:36,367
of your house.

126
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:09,358
NEW MESSAGE, MR. HAN

127
00:10:12,069 --> 00:10:13,946
Mr. Oh just went into the room.

128
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:22,496
Is the company running properly
without any problems?

129
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:26,083
Our sales are steadily on the rise,
and the factory is running well.

130
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:30,546
The factory is running well?

131
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:34,175
Are you saying the factory
hasn't been shaken up

132
00:10:35,176 --> 00:10:36,886
even though I sold the company
and disappeared?

133
00:10:37,178 --> 00:10:39,347
Mr. Han is very sly.

134
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:42,642
He's calling himself
a management specialist

135
00:10:43,017 --> 00:10:44,477
and gaining their trust.

136
00:10:45,394 --> 00:10:47,063
He's already built his own
camp of supporters.

137
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:50,816
I doubt he started this because he was
interested in the company, though.

138
00:10:50,941 --> 00:10:53,861
That can't be true. He's managing it
with a lot of enthusiasm.

139
00:10:56,614 --> 00:11:00,451
He's just a hunting dog
with a good sense of smell for money.

140
00:11:00,534 --> 00:11:02,620
He already has people
on his side within the company.

141
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:04,580
His side?

142
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:06,999
I think he's been meeting with
Mr. Chairman's daughter quite often.

143
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:09,669
It seems like Mr. Han has a hidden agenda.

144
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:11,921
I think we should look into it further.

145
00:11:12,129 --> 00:11:15,216
I've never met a single person
who doesn't have a hidden agenda.

146
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:18,636
That must be the only way
to avoid falling. No that must be

147
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:20,012
why they don't fall.

148
00:11:22,598 --> 00:11:25,476
A-jin got a medical note claiming
Mr. Ahn has dementia.

149
00:11:27,561 --> 00:11:29,647
She must be trying to
nullify the stock transfer.

150
00:11:29,855 --> 00:11:31,065
I'm aware of that already.

151
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,943
Did you meet with A-jin?

152
00:11:34,151 --> 00:11:37,321
Yes, if she files the lawsuit,
it will be a huge legal battle.

153
00:11:37,613 --> 00:11:41,409
Mr. Kim and I can prove
that Mr. Ahn doesn't have dementia.

154
00:11:41,617 --> 00:11:45,413
No, A-jin isn't that stupid.

155
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:49,542
Mr. Ahn didn't go to work
while he was under treatment

156
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:52,586
so your testimonies
won't be very effective.

157
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:55,172
It's a different story with Mr. Kim.

158
00:12:09,103 --> 00:12:10,980
Don't call me out at this hour
from now on.

159
00:12:11,063 --> 00:12:12,731
I'm really busy these days.

160
00:12:13,107 --> 00:12:14,316
Then when should I call you out?

161
00:12:14,859 --> 00:12:16,444
I'll call you out instead.

162
00:12:16,861 --> 00:12:20,364
Really? Then, I'll patiently wait.

163
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:22,908
Is work going well these days?

164
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:24,910
I heard your blog really took off.

165
00:12:25,327 --> 00:12:27,621
-Have you seen it?
-Of course.

166
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,331
You're a cool woman, A-jin.

167
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:32,376
-I'll cheer you on.
-Thank you.

168
00:12:33,794 --> 00:12:35,629
-Where are we going?
-I'm not sure.

169
00:13:19,507 --> 00:13:22,885
I will sue for violation of portrait
rights and defamation of character.

170
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:27,014
Of course, you should.
We want that as well.

171
00:13:27,598 --> 00:13:30,392
That way, our apartment's image
will be firmly promoted.

172
00:13:31,685 --> 00:13:33,437
Don't you understand what I'm saying?

173
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:36,357
If the apartment's residents
publicize the news

174
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:38,901
that we're campaigning to recover
our proper living space

175
00:13:38,984 --> 00:13:41,946
for the sake of our apartment's
high-quality image,

176
00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:45,533
we'd be really thankful for your efforts.

177
00:13:46,909 --> 00:13:49,495
If we are charged, we'll get
an immediate court decision

178
00:13:49,578 --> 00:13:51,580
of a 500,000 won fine.

179
00:13:51,997 --> 00:13:53,874
You see, my husband is a lawyer.

180
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:56,669
That's how I looked into it
in such detail.

181
00:13:58,712 --> 00:14:01,340
Oh my, your boyfriend
is here to pick you up.

182
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:04,343
Then we'll get going first.

183
00:14:04,593 --> 00:14:06,262
I wish you luck in preparing
for the lawsuit.

184
00:14:18,774 --> 00:14:19,775
Where did A-jin go?

185
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:22,194
I will never give up on this house.

186
00:14:22,903 --> 00:14:25,281
I've lost way too much because of you.

187
00:14:25,447 --> 00:14:27,491
-I asked where A-jin went.
-I don't know!

188
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:33,455
Oh my, those two aren't on good terms.

189
00:14:33,747 --> 00:14:36,000
-Oh my, his ex is coming!
-Oh my god!

190
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:37,626
A man is with her!

191
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:40,087
Oh my, the husband saw.

192
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:41,547
You bastard!

193
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:46,010
What the heck?

194
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:49,263
It's shameful and vulgar
but this is a new turn.

195
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:52,016
-Let's go, Gi-ho.
-What? "Gi-ho"?

196
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:54,310
Wow, do you address each other by name?

197
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,604
-Let's go, A-jin.
-Hey! You two!

198
00:14:56,812 --> 00:14:59,106
-Let's just see each other in court.
-There's no need.

199
00:14:59,189 --> 00:15:01,734
I'm going to give that house to my wife!

200
00:15:04,194 --> 00:15:06,196
I said I'm going to give
that house to my wife!

201
00:15:06,447 --> 00:15:09,450
I had her sign
a name trust agreement before.

202
00:15:09,825 --> 00:15:12,369
-What are you saying?
-That house is to be occupied

203
00:15:12,453 --> 00:15:14,413
by me, A-jin Woo, and Ji-hu Ahn.

204
00:15:14,496 --> 00:15:18,000
And I will confidently change
the ownership to A-jin Woo.

205
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:22,379
Let's sue him. Are you crazy?
Why would I live with you?

206
00:15:22,796 --> 00:15:25,883
A-jin, you've become really rough
after seeing this guy.

207
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:29,845
If you say one more thing, I'll hit you.

208
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:30,971
A-jin!

209
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:44,318
Hey! You!

210
00:15:46,403 --> 00:15:47,488
-Mom.
-Yeah?

211
00:15:47,988 --> 00:15:48,989
I want to see Dad.

212
00:15:50,532 --> 00:15:52,326
Okay, then. You can see him after school.

213
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:53,827
-Really?
-Yeah.

214
00:16:04,922 --> 00:16:07,174
Eat lots, my love.

215
00:16:31,156 --> 00:16:32,741
Aren't you going to Pung-suk's Kitchen?

216
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:35,744
Mr. Ahn isn't home and the house is empty,

217
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:37,913
so it's been a long time...

218
00:16:39,957 --> 00:16:42,209
I really liked food
from Pung-suk's Kitchen.

219
00:16:42,918 --> 00:16:44,586
Especially the chonggak kimchi.

220
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:45,921
It was unique, wasn't it?

221
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:48,424
I want to eat it. Pick some up today.

222
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:50,050
Sure, ma'am.

223
00:16:52,302 --> 00:16:54,138
Why aren't you on that woman's side?

224
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:02,312
It's really hard to know
what you're thinking, Ms. Jo.

225
00:17:19,246 --> 00:17:20,205
Welcome.

226
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:22,875
Aren't you making kimchi?

227
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:25,961
We're not making kimchi today
but we just finished the marinated crab.

228
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:29,214
I guess they're starting to come.

229
00:17:33,844 --> 00:17:34,970
Who are you?

230
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:41,727
We're from Seoul's national tax service,
bureau of investigation.

231
00:17:42,519 --> 00:17:44,188
A citizen made a report

232
00:17:44,772 --> 00:17:48,525
saying you illegally produce, distribute,
and sell products and evade taxes.

233
00:17:59,495 --> 00:18:00,329
My goodness.

234
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:03,499
Hello?

235
00:18:03,999 --> 00:18:06,001
Oh my, Mr. Park.

236
00:18:06,543 --> 00:18:07,586
Yes.

237
00:18:08,003 --> 00:18:09,755
You did a good job.

238
00:18:10,005 --> 00:18:12,341
I'll buy you a drink some time.

239
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:15,135
Okay, talk to you later.

240
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:17,679
Take this away.

241
00:18:19,056 --> 00:18:20,265
Shit.

242
00:18:20,474 --> 00:18:24,394
Who does she think I am?
Does she want to die?

243
00:18:25,312 --> 00:18:28,232
She needs to lose everything
to come to her senses.

244
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,566
Oh, I'm sorry.

245
00:18:31,568 --> 00:18:35,239
By the way,
about that branch manager, Mr. Park.

246
00:18:36,031 --> 00:18:38,200
I couldn't find him
when I searched him online.

247
00:18:39,076 --> 00:18:40,536
Oh, he's in the black market.

248
00:18:41,036 --> 00:18:44,248
It's not a bank that gives out
ordinary loans,

249
00:18:44,498 --> 00:18:46,041
so he can become
a target if exposes himself.

250
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:49,503
The black market is what
moves our economy.

251
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,630
Oh, I see.

252
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:55,300
Your bank loan will be approved
at 3 o'clock this afternoon

253
00:18:55,759 --> 00:18:57,010
and it'll be deposited right away.

254
00:18:57,302 --> 00:18:58,303
Great.

255
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:03,267
But, the power of attorney that I forged

256
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:06,019
is a secret between the two of us, okay?

257
00:19:06,436 --> 00:19:07,521
Don't worry.

258
00:19:07,896 --> 00:19:11,066
If Mr. Ahn was awake, he would have
made the same decision anyway.

259
00:19:12,734 --> 00:19:15,612
But, did you get the consent
of your siblings?

260
00:19:15,863 --> 00:19:16,738
No.

261
00:19:17,364 --> 00:19:20,492
I haven't been able to contact
Jae-gu for a few days now,

262
00:19:20,909 --> 00:19:23,203
and Jae-seok is worried
about his own affairs,

263
00:19:23,287 --> 00:19:24,955
so he's not interested in the company.

264
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:29,126
But what should I do about Bok-ja Park?

265
00:19:29,918 --> 00:19:31,336
I have to get that money back.

266
00:19:31,879 --> 00:19:34,923
When Bok-ja Park kicked you
out of the house,

267
00:19:35,215 --> 00:19:36,550
you shouldn't have left.

268
00:19:37,092 --> 00:19:40,596
You should have guarded
your father until the end.

269
00:19:41,972 --> 00:19:44,266
But you know about
our family matters so well.

270
00:19:44,933 --> 00:19:46,894
I'm very interested in you, Jae-hui.

271
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:48,854
I probably know everything about you.

272
00:19:50,731 --> 00:19:52,316
I heard you mix cola with your rice.

273
00:19:53,775 --> 00:19:55,485
Did Bok-ja Park tell you about that, too?

274
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:03,118
Please explain it
to the chairman well, ma'am.

275
00:20:03,577 --> 00:20:06,788
At this rate, it'll be hard for us
to stay in business here.

276
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:11,293
They took the computer hard drive
containing our list of clients.

277
00:20:12,002 --> 00:20:15,714
One works for tax services and
the other is a newspaper reporter.

278
00:20:16,965 --> 00:20:18,926
Yes, ma'am. Please do that.

279
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:24,431
Kimchi? We're all out
so have to make a fresh batch,

280
00:20:24,848 --> 00:20:26,475
but we are unable to operate
at the moment.

281
00:20:38,153 --> 00:20:39,446
Do we have any more kimchi?

282
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:43,116
Sir, the thing is...

283
00:20:44,117 --> 00:20:46,954
Pung-suk's Kitchen is being investigated.

284
00:20:47,537 --> 00:20:49,164
It sounds like someone targeted them.

285
00:20:50,374 --> 00:20:53,043
They said they might have to
close down the business.

286
00:20:53,961 --> 00:20:56,421
They can't do that! They can't!

287
00:20:56,755 --> 00:20:58,215
I need my kimchi!

288
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:04,596
Neither one wants to settle.

289
00:21:04,846 --> 00:21:07,391
Please convince both parties
to come to an agreement.

290
00:21:07,557 --> 00:21:10,352
If they do, your husband
will only have to pay a fine,

291
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:14,439
and that hospital director must sign an
agreement for the charge to be dropped.

292
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:17,484
I understand. I'll talk to both of them.

293
00:21:18,026 --> 00:21:18,944
Okay.

294
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:26,493
Whose side is that woman on?

295
00:21:27,035 --> 00:21:28,912
They need to make adultery illegal again.

296
00:21:32,082 --> 00:21:33,375
Hello, this is Division 2.

297
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,879
Pardon? They won't proceed with it?

298
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:41,258
Okay, I understand.

299
00:21:47,723 --> 00:21:49,891
NOTICE

300
00:22:21,673 --> 00:22:22,799
Have you been well?

301
00:22:22,966 --> 00:22:23,842
What the heck?

302
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:27,012
Why do you want to meet
at places like this these days?

303
00:22:32,601 --> 00:22:33,560
Take this.

304
00:22:37,814 --> 00:22:40,650
You said this looked cool
when you saw it on TV.

305
00:22:41,401 --> 00:22:42,569
You said you wanted to wear it.

306
00:22:42,861 --> 00:22:45,030
Thank you, I love it.

307
00:22:49,159 --> 00:22:50,452
Is your girlfriend doing well?

308
00:22:52,454 --> 00:22:53,330
Gi-seok.

309
00:22:54,998 --> 00:22:56,208
You're a cool kid.

310
00:22:56,541 --> 00:22:58,043
So value your life.

311
00:22:58,376 --> 00:23:00,879
And don't sleep with women
you don't love...

312
00:23:00,962 --> 00:23:02,255
Are you going to church these days?

313
00:23:02,464 --> 00:23:03,757
Why are you giving me a sermon?

314
00:23:05,467 --> 00:23:06,301
I was...

315
00:23:08,678 --> 00:23:10,055
thankful to you all this time.

316
00:23:10,388 --> 00:23:11,848
I was happy thanks to you.

317
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:19,231
Take it. This is what
our relationship came down to.

318
00:23:22,651 --> 00:23:26,279
Hyo-ju, you're right. I didn't love you.

319
00:23:26,404 --> 00:23:28,156
But I don't want to live
without you either.

320
00:23:28,532 --> 00:23:29,366
Money?

321
00:23:29,449 --> 00:23:31,493
You don't have to give it to me,
so just keep seeing me.

322
00:23:35,831 --> 00:23:36,957
Thanks, Gi-seok.

323
00:23:38,458 --> 00:23:42,170
When you said that I feel less miserable.

324
00:23:45,006 --> 00:23:46,133
Let's have some tea.

325
00:23:47,384 --> 00:23:49,261
You like hot chocolate
with whipped cream, right?

326
00:23:49,761 --> 00:23:51,596
-Yeah.
-That's your taste.

327
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,932
You have to add a lot of cinnamon
in your coffee, too.

328
00:23:55,725 --> 00:23:58,770
Do you know what I usually drink

329
00:23:58,854 --> 00:24:00,355
at cafes?

330
00:24:01,898 --> 00:24:03,608
You don't know what I like, do you?

331
00:24:04,901 --> 00:24:05,819
We...

332
00:24:09,281 --> 00:24:11,992
had different expectations
for this relationship.

333
00:24:12,617 --> 00:24:14,411
It's my fault. I...

334
00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:18,707
fell in too deep all by myself.

335
00:24:22,002 --> 00:24:23,086
I'll bring the drinks.

336
00:24:32,179 --> 00:24:33,096
I'm...

337
00:24:34,472 --> 00:24:35,473
getting a divorce.

338
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:38,852
I'm seeing someone.

339
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:41,479
It's not...

340
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:44,441
Don't worry. It's not Dr. Jang.

341
00:24:45,442 --> 00:24:48,945
Then who is it? Did you
find another man already?

342
00:24:49,654 --> 00:24:52,949
Dr. Jang never loved me.

343
00:24:53,658 --> 00:24:54,951
I never loved him either.

344
00:24:55,785 --> 00:24:57,913
-We're just...
-Stop it. It's dirty.

345
00:24:59,206 --> 00:25:03,335
I just want all of this to end.

346
00:25:04,836 --> 00:25:08,465
I want everyone to forget
about what happened.

347
00:25:10,675 --> 00:25:12,093
Is this something that can be forgotten?

348
00:25:13,094 --> 00:25:16,765
It's not like I can wash it off with
detergent as if it's a washroom floor.

349
00:25:17,515 --> 00:25:18,558
I know.

350
00:25:18,934 --> 00:25:22,646
Hey, you sure live an easy life.

351
00:25:23,813 --> 00:25:25,148
I feel weird.

352
00:25:25,941 --> 00:25:28,818
So, are you saying you were
dating someone else

353
00:25:29,569 --> 00:25:31,071
while you were seeing my husband?

354
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:33,990
No, it wasn't like that. It was just...

355
00:25:34,074 --> 00:25:35,033
Just what?

356
00:25:37,744 --> 00:25:38,828
It was fate.

357
00:25:43,124 --> 00:25:44,292
I'll do my best.

358
00:26:07,857 --> 00:26:08,775
Oh my!

359
00:26:08,858 --> 00:26:10,068
What do we do?

360
00:26:10,151 --> 00:26:11,861
It's so pretty,
that I'm ordering it right away!

361
00:26:11,945 --> 00:26:13,488
I'm sad that it sold out last week.

362
00:26:16,199 --> 00:26:17,450
A-jin!

363
00:26:19,869 --> 00:26:22,205
Does this mean I have to
look into a new factory?

364
00:26:22,539 --> 00:26:24,207
How am I going to fill all these orders?

365
00:26:24,499 --> 00:26:27,127
I know, right? You might have to
hire more employees, too.

366
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:29,337
I'll manage the work of many by myself.

367
00:26:30,797 --> 00:26:33,675
Jin-hee, then go to the boutique
to place these orders

368
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:34,968
and visit the factory, okay?

369
00:26:35,343 --> 00:26:36,553
Who's going to pick up Ji-hu?

370
00:26:38,013 --> 00:26:40,265
Her father who lost his job
has been picking her up these days.

371
00:26:40,348 --> 00:26:41,391
Don't worry.

372
00:26:43,685 --> 00:26:46,604
The phone is currently turned off,
so please leave a message...

373
00:26:46,688 --> 00:26:47,814
JAE-GU

374
00:26:56,072 --> 00:26:58,742
It's me. Where's my husband?

375
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:03,288
You're asking me
all sorts of questions now.

376
00:27:03,997 --> 00:27:05,665
How am I supposed to know that?

377
00:27:05,999 --> 00:27:07,375
If you don't, who does?

378
00:27:07,459 --> 00:27:09,377
Call the police and report him missing.

379
00:27:09,461 --> 00:27:12,464
That's the easiest way.
Why are you asking me?

380
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:15,425
I'm hanging up.

381
00:27:17,969 --> 00:27:21,598
You kept Jae-gu Ahn alive, right?

382
00:27:28,146 --> 00:27:30,607
Are you saying you want to
hold a group exhibit

383
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:33,902
of 42 rookie artists
at the New York Artpolitan Gallery?

384
00:27:34,402 --> 00:27:37,864
The New York Artpolitan Gallery and the
France Dobi Gallery are cosponsors.

385
00:27:37,947 --> 00:27:39,407
And our gallery has always supported it.

386
00:27:40,367 --> 00:27:43,411
Shouldn't we send an artist
to represent our gallery as well?

387
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:46,748
Of course. We should send
our most promising painter.

388
00:27:48,416 --> 00:27:49,417
How about Seong-hui Yun?

389
00:27:54,381 --> 00:27:55,590
Why is everyone surprised?

390
00:28:04,933 --> 00:28:07,060
Hello, I'm Ji-young Park.

391
00:28:15,568 --> 00:28:18,488
I came to answer your question
from last time, A-jin.

392
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:23,743
My answer is no.

393
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:27,330
-Is that so?
-And...

394
00:28:28,748 --> 00:28:31,000
regarding Mr. Chairman's
dementia diagnosis,

395
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:33,878
the verification of its authenticity
is important, too,

396
00:28:34,170 --> 00:28:36,673
but Mr. Kim said, Mr. Chairman

397
00:28:36,756 --> 00:28:40,176
was in a very normal state of mind.

398
00:28:41,261 --> 00:28:42,262
Of course.

399
00:28:42,512 --> 00:28:45,223
He needs to say that to cover up his past.

400
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:49,310
If he knew that a feeble-minded
chairman of a company

401
00:28:49,394 --> 00:28:51,312
made the wrong decision,

402
00:28:51,938 --> 00:28:54,441
but went along with it as his lawyer,

403
00:28:54,649 --> 00:28:56,276
that would have been
a professional mistake.

404
00:28:56,735 --> 00:28:58,862
If people find out,
he'll get in trouble as well.

405
00:28:59,863 --> 00:29:01,156
I will file the lawsuit right away.

406
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:04,492
I advise that you appoint
an attorney, too.

407
00:29:05,827 --> 00:29:08,580
You approached our father
on purpose, right?

408
00:29:10,415 --> 00:29:13,084
You purposely got a job
at that fitness club,

409
00:29:13,501 --> 00:29:16,421
locked in our father as your target,
and crept toward him.

410
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:19,841
This lawsuit will start from there.

411
00:29:24,012 --> 00:29:26,598
Everything you did was planned.

412
00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:30,310
The uphill climb was easier
than you thought, wasn't it?

413
00:29:30,727 --> 00:29:33,688
Your climb back down will be
even easier. Look forward to it.

414
00:29:34,898 --> 00:29:37,942
You divorced him. You're no longer
a part of the household.

415
00:29:39,486 --> 00:29:41,738
Why are you doing all of this?

416
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:46,159
Let's just say I'm restoring
social justice.

417
00:29:46,576 --> 00:29:48,620
I'm the one who brought you
into that house.

418
00:29:49,245 --> 00:29:51,372
I should take responsibility
for what I've done.

419
00:29:51,915 --> 00:29:54,876
And, I was the one
who introduced Jae-seok Ahn

420
00:29:54,959 --> 00:29:56,753
to the woman he had an affair with.

421
00:29:57,837 --> 00:30:00,465
So, I took responsibility
for that as well.

422
00:30:01,299 --> 00:30:02,300
Through a divorce.

423
00:30:04,302 --> 00:30:05,220
I...

424
00:30:06,721 --> 00:30:09,182
will never have it taken away from me.

425
00:30:10,767 --> 00:30:14,020
You can't have it taken away
if it was never yours, to begin with.

426
00:30:14,938 --> 00:30:16,272
What you did...

427
00:30:17,482 --> 00:30:18,566
was commit theft.

428
00:30:22,403 --> 00:30:24,781
Oh my, ma'am. You look so elegant.

429
00:30:25,907 --> 00:30:27,617
I look like an actress now, don't I?

430
00:30:28,576 --> 00:30:30,787
-I love your style.
-Thank you.

431
00:30:55,854 --> 00:30:56,771
Who...

432
00:30:58,273 --> 00:31:00,859
is it? Gosh, I don't know.

433
00:31:02,986 --> 00:31:05,321
Gosh, this is so bothersome.

434
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:33,892
Jeez. Who wrapped this...

435
00:31:41,774 --> 00:31:43,026
Who the hell...

436
00:31:44,986 --> 00:31:46,029
Gosh, seriously.

437
00:31:51,784 --> 00:31:53,745
I had a great experience thanks to you.

438
00:31:53,995 --> 00:31:56,122
I made salted hairtail today,

439
00:31:56,372 --> 00:31:58,291
so I sent you the leftover heads.

440
00:31:58,958 --> 00:32:00,460
They say the heads taste the best.

441
00:32:05,089 --> 00:32:06,799
How did she know I was here?

442
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:15,516
Mr. Han.

443
00:32:17,644 --> 00:32:18,686
Damn it!

444
00:32:22,649 --> 00:32:25,193
It'd be better
if Bong-cheol Gu can testify.

445
00:32:25,818 --> 00:32:26,945
He said he will.

446
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:31,157
By the way, what are you going to do
about your house?

447
00:32:31,366 --> 00:32:32,867
What about the property partition claim?

448
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:35,495
I simply want to claim my property rights

449
00:32:35,578 --> 00:32:39,082
to the house where Ji-hu and I can live.

450
00:32:39,832 --> 00:32:41,000
I don't want anything more.

451
00:32:41,501 --> 00:32:44,545
Jae-seok Ahn appealed
to the divorce ruling.

452
00:32:49,968 --> 00:32:51,219
He's a funny person.

453
00:32:57,809 --> 00:32:59,143
I don't know anything about this.

454
00:33:00,478 --> 00:33:03,564
She dared to send me something like this.

455
00:33:06,442 --> 00:33:09,320
I already know that she provided
you with information

456
00:33:09,404 --> 00:33:10,780
about me.

457
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:12,156
It still doesn't matter.

458
00:33:13,116 --> 00:33:15,034
I heard you reported them
to the national tax service.

459
00:33:15,201 --> 00:33:16,494
You informed the reporters, too.

460
00:33:17,787 --> 00:33:19,998
Pung-suk's Kitchen is a funny place.

461
00:33:20,373 --> 00:33:22,667
I listen to stories about them every night

462
00:33:23,126 --> 00:33:24,335
to de-stress.

463
00:33:25,503 --> 00:33:27,797
It's more realistic than any soap opera.

464
00:33:28,506 --> 00:33:30,383
-What are you saying?
-That's right.

465
00:33:31,509 --> 00:33:35,013
All conversations in Pung-suk's Kitchen
are recorded

466
00:33:35,638 --> 00:33:38,474
and given to me
by Pung-suk's Kitchen's boss.

467
00:33:39,434 --> 00:33:41,227
I pay her for them.

468
00:33:41,602 --> 00:33:45,064
Those recordings contain
unbelievable information.

469
00:33:47,191 --> 00:33:48,234
Is that how...

470
00:33:52,947 --> 00:33:56,826
Are you saying you intentionally
approached me?

471
00:33:57,035 --> 00:33:57,869
Of course.

472
00:33:58,453 --> 00:34:00,705
I heard that you'd enroll
in Global Management Graduate School

473
00:34:01,122 --> 00:34:04,792
and I even heard when you would
start the program.

474
00:34:07,628 --> 00:34:11,299
Then, why did you tell me
to sell the company?

475
00:34:11,591 --> 00:34:14,010
Daesung Pulp is worth so much right now!

476
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:16,012
75 billion won is a steal!

477
00:34:16,471 --> 00:34:19,015
Oh, that's right.
I received another ten billion won.

478
00:34:19,724 --> 00:34:23,144
From Jae-hui Ahn. She forged
Mr. Ahn's power of attorney

479
00:34:23,311 --> 00:34:26,564
to borrow ten billion won with his real
estate as collateral, to pay the deposit.

480
00:34:26,647 --> 00:34:28,232
She says she's going
to take back the company.

481
00:34:29,317 --> 00:34:31,736
But the investment bank can't give her
the intermediate payment.

482
00:34:31,986 --> 00:34:33,696
Because the investment won't be approved.

483
00:34:34,447 --> 00:34:37,742
It's possible if the board of directors
approve it, but that won't happen either.

484
00:34:38,659 --> 00:34:42,622
So the deposit she borrowed
will be out the window.

485
00:34:43,623 --> 00:34:46,334
In the end, I took over the
company for 65 billion won.

486
00:34:46,417 --> 00:34:49,462
I could get anything from that family
without any effort.

487
00:34:51,005 --> 00:34:52,757
-You...
-You're right.

488
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:57,386
I prefer people from the lower class
who are full of desires

489
00:34:58,763 --> 00:34:59,931
just like you.

490
00:35:08,523 --> 00:35:11,484
What are you doing?
Do you think I'm a joke?

491
00:35:11,651 --> 00:35:14,320
I do. Very much so.

492
00:35:14,946 --> 00:35:17,740
You're not suited for this world.
You're too emotional.

493
00:35:19,283 --> 00:35:21,786
Do you know why lower-class citizens
can't move up to the upper class?

494
00:35:22,036 --> 00:35:23,621
Because of sentimentalism.

495
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:26,332
They probably call it humanity.

496
00:35:26,707 --> 00:35:28,417
But that's not true! It's defeatism!

497
00:35:28,793 --> 00:35:30,711
It's a game they can't win
so they drop out.

498
00:35:31,045 --> 00:35:34,507
And they stay in the lower class and
bluff about how they're living

499
00:35:34,590 --> 00:35:35,633
according to their means!

500
00:35:36,008 --> 00:35:37,760
You're a piece of trash.

501
00:35:40,221 --> 00:35:41,430
Did you call me trash?

502
00:35:42,723 --> 00:35:43,724
Then what are you?

503
00:35:45,351 --> 00:35:49,313
Bok-ja Park! Make up your
mind! Go all the way!

504
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:52,316
If you drove over the center line,
just drive the wrong way!

505
00:35:52,441 --> 00:35:55,069
Get into a head-on collision
with an oncoming car

506
00:35:55,319 --> 00:35:56,863
and crush that car completely!

507
00:36:01,284 --> 00:36:02,827
Why are you slowing down now?

508
00:36:03,202 --> 00:36:06,831
Did you actually like that old man?

509
00:36:06,914 --> 00:36:08,124
Shut your mouth.

510
00:36:11,794 --> 00:36:12,795
Don't...

511
00:36:16,257 --> 00:36:17,925
Don't lay a finger on that house.

512
00:36:18,551 --> 00:36:19,677
It's already too late.

513
00:36:21,095 --> 00:36:22,597
They probably received the notice by now.

514
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:29,437
Everyone was tangled up with one another

515
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,564
like a ball of yarn.

516
00:36:31,689 --> 00:36:34,734
I'm sorry. You weren't
approved for the loan

517
00:36:35,067 --> 00:36:36,611
so an additional loan can't be given.

518
00:36:37,028 --> 00:36:38,863
Wait, how can that be?

519
00:36:39,447 --> 00:36:41,657
I just did what Mr. Han told me to do!

520
00:36:42,074 --> 00:36:45,661
I mean, I even used my brother's
stocks as collateral.

521
00:36:45,912 --> 00:36:48,372
-And the sale credit...
-That was all considered

522
00:36:48,456 --> 00:36:49,624
when the deposit

523
00:36:49,790 --> 00:36:51,751
of ten billion won was loaned to you.

524
00:36:51,834 --> 00:36:55,004
No. If I don't deposit another
10 billion won by the 12th,

525
00:36:55,254 --> 00:36:56,672
the contract will be canceled!

526
00:36:56,756 --> 00:36:58,758
You should talk to MK Capital about that.

527
00:36:59,133 --> 00:37:01,636
I've clearly explained
our position. I should go.

528
00:37:02,011 --> 00:37:02,970
Mr. Park.

529
00:37:03,429 --> 00:37:04,472
Mr. Park!

530
00:37:04,889 --> 00:37:06,140
What do I do now?

531
00:37:06,807 --> 00:37:09,352
This is driving me crazy! What time is it?

532
00:37:11,896 --> 00:37:14,815
Hello? Mr. Han!

533
00:37:15,024 --> 00:37:18,569
Oh no, you weren't approved
for a loan, were you?

534
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:21,072
That happens sometimes.

535
00:37:22,823 --> 00:37:25,701
-That's too bad.
-You can't say that!

536
00:37:26,244 --> 00:37:28,162
I did this because you told me to!

537
00:37:29,455 --> 00:37:31,958
Hello?

538
00:37:33,834 --> 00:37:36,420
What do I do? What to do?

539
00:37:36,504 --> 00:37:38,381
That's when the misunderstandings began.

540
00:37:39,757 --> 00:37:43,469
Because we all thought this was
a part of Bok-ja Park's scheme.

541
00:38:18,421 --> 00:38:20,006
-Is it good?
-Yeah.

542
00:38:38,399 --> 00:38:40,109
What on earth are you doing?

543
00:38:41,485 --> 00:38:44,739
Do you know expensive
this cosmetic product is?

544
00:38:46,657 --> 00:38:48,993
If you're going to run
a business in Gangnam,

545
00:38:49,076 --> 00:38:51,537
you should use high-quality
ingredients, don't you think?

546
00:38:55,624 --> 00:38:59,003
-Oh my!
-Gosh! What are you doing?

547
00:39:05,176 --> 00:39:06,594
Don't mess with me.

548
00:39:07,011 --> 00:39:10,681
If you mess with me one more
time, I'll grind you up

549
00:39:11,307 --> 00:39:13,809
and use you for salted
seafood with kimchi.

550
00:39:20,608 --> 00:39:21,484
Jeez.

551
00:39:28,032 --> 00:39:29,575
Did you send me hairtail heads?

552
00:39:30,701 --> 00:39:33,412
You must have lost your mind.

553
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:32,138
A-jin, I think we should open a shop!

554
00:40:32,304 --> 00:40:34,515
We should! But,

555
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:36,517
we can accept her generosity for now.

556
00:40:36,684 --> 00:40:37,768
My goodness.

557
00:40:38,853 --> 00:40:41,480
She lent me 20 million won
when I opened this shop

558
00:40:41,564 --> 00:40:43,190
and told me to pay her back
when I succeed.

559
00:40:43,607 --> 00:40:46,986
I still haven't paid you back yet,
so I'll just deduct it from your rent.

560
00:41:04,879 --> 00:41:07,131
Why is she still so confident,

561
00:41:07,339 --> 00:41:09,049
even though she lost everything?

562
00:41:12,052 --> 00:41:15,222
And why aren't I confident at all,

563
00:41:16,265 --> 00:41:19,185
even though I have everything? Why?

564
00:41:23,898 --> 00:41:27,693
What do I have to do to be just like her?

565
00:41:29,487 --> 00:41:33,449
Why is it that I can't smile like her?

566
00:41:34,950 --> 00:41:35,826
Why?

567
00:41:46,003 --> 00:41:47,087
Hi, Hyo-ju.

568
00:41:47,171 --> 00:41:49,381
I got a call
from the portal manager today.

569
00:41:50,216 --> 00:41:53,969
A-jin, this is totally epic!

570
00:41:55,387 --> 00:41:56,514
What do you mean?

571
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:07,399
It's nice to meet you, Ms. Woo.

572
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:10,277
As I told you over the phone,

573
00:42:10,361 --> 00:42:12,488
our company would like to
create a special line

574
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:14,448
for the upcoming season,

575
00:42:14,865 --> 00:42:16,992
with your products
which I saw on the blog.

576
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:21,830
I will support you wholeheartedly
and hold a fashion show for you as well.

577
00:42:21,956 --> 00:42:23,082
What do you think?

578
00:42:24,083 --> 00:42:25,417
I'll think about it.

579
00:42:25,501 --> 00:42:26,752
As you should.

580
00:42:27,294 --> 00:42:29,922
Then I'll propose our conditions first.

581
00:42:53,028 --> 00:42:54,113
What happened?

582
00:42:55,114 --> 00:42:57,783
You clearly told me there would be
no problems with the loan.

583
00:42:58,075 --> 00:43:00,202
I heard about it from Mr. Park.

584
00:43:02,121 --> 00:43:03,789
I guess you weren't approved
for the investment.

585
00:43:04,331 --> 00:43:05,207
Then...

586
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:09,169
is our contract canceled?

587
00:43:09,378 --> 00:43:11,922
If you give me the intermediate payment
of ten billion won by tomorrow,

588
00:43:12,006 --> 00:43:14,008
-there won't be a reason to cancel it.
-Gosh, seriously.

589
00:43:15,009 --> 00:43:18,804
Then, let's just pretend like
we never made this deal.

590
00:43:19,388 --> 00:43:22,641
I see. Well, if that's what you want.

591
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:27,229
Are you going to refund me
the ten billion won?

592
00:43:27,646 --> 00:43:30,190
-Pardon?
-I mean, if it turned out this way,

593
00:43:30,274 --> 00:43:32,026
you should give me back my deposit.

594
00:43:32,276 --> 00:43:35,279
I mean, I have to give it
back to the bank.

595
00:43:37,239 --> 00:43:39,283
This is why I like you, Jae-hui.

596
00:43:39,908 --> 00:43:42,286
You're really pure and naive for your age.

597
00:43:42,745 --> 00:43:44,913
I've never met anyone
from a rich household who is so naive...

598
00:43:50,169 --> 00:43:51,337
in my life.

599
00:43:53,881 --> 00:43:55,049
Then what are you saying?

600
00:43:55,674 --> 00:43:58,469
Are you saying you won't
give me my money back?

601
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:05,768
Is this your first time negotiating

602
00:44:06,435 --> 00:44:07,436
and signing a contract?

603
00:44:09,647 --> 00:44:11,940
Give me back my money! Give it back!

604
00:44:12,024 --> 00:44:13,609
I don't find crying women attractive.

605
00:44:14,818 --> 00:44:16,195
Give me back my money!

606
00:44:16,654 --> 00:44:19,657
Give the money back!
I have to give it back to the bank.

607
00:44:20,366 --> 00:44:23,452
If I don't, we'll all die! All of us!

608
00:44:25,037 --> 00:44:25,996
Please!

609
00:44:26,622 --> 00:44:29,333
You just have to pretend like
we never signed the contract.

610
00:44:47,976 --> 00:44:49,019
Hello?

611
00:44:50,270 --> 00:44:53,399
A-jin! I'm in trouble!

612
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:56,819
I've been scammed!

613
00:45:06,662 --> 00:45:09,081
That gun incident. And the assault
of his step-mother.

614
00:45:09,164 --> 00:45:12,292
My husband has gone missing.
I'm unable to reach him.

615
00:45:12,501 --> 00:45:15,379
He's probably got drunk
and slept at a sauna.

616
00:45:15,462 --> 00:45:16,630
I don't think that's the case.

617
00:45:18,590 --> 00:45:19,508
I think...

618
00:45:21,301 --> 00:45:23,011
someone kidnapped my husband...

619
00:45:24,346 --> 00:45:25,472
hurt him...

620
00:45:27,933 --> 00:45:29,435
or killed him.

621
00:45:30,978 --> 00:45:32,229
Why do you think that?

622
00:45:32,479 --> 00:45:34,398
Because my hunches have never been wrong.

623
00:45:36,525 --> 00:45:37,818
So please find him.

624
00:45:44,283 --> 00:45:45,909
-Name?
-I know the suspect.

625
00:45:54,209 --> 00:45:57,129
I want to check something on the computer.

626
00:45:57,296 --> 00:45:58,881
Sure, ma'am. How can I help you?

627
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:02,217
Can I take a look at a certified
copy of the register?

628
00:46:02,509 --> 00:46:04,803
-A certified copy of the register?
-Yes.

629
00:46:04,887 --> 00:46:06,680

DEBTOR: TAE-DONG AHN

632
00:46:15,731 --> 00:46:20,235
The collateral security bank is CJS Bank.

633
00:46:22,529 --> 00:46:24,907
I'm Ja-sil Choi.

634
00:46:25,032 --> 00:46:26,992
She's the representative
of CJS Investment Bank.

00:46:27,284 --> 00:46:29,912
Let's just say she is a big influence
in the black economy of our country.

636
00:46:41,131 --> 00:46:42,424
What on earth happened?

637
00:46:45,093 --> 00:46:46,261
Explain it to me slowly.

638
00:46:47,054 --> 00:46:48,722
We're in trouble, A-jin.

639
00:46:48,931 --> 00:46:50,849
It looks like we might end up penniless.

640
00:46:51,183 --> 00:46:52,059
We're...

641
00:46:53,435 --> 00:46:55,354
going to lose that house!

642
00:46:56,897 --> 00:46:59,608
-Pardon?
-I was tricked, A-jin. What do I do?

643
00:47:00,108 --> 00:47:03,320
I might go crazy! I fell into a trap!

644
00:47:03,445 --> 00:47:05,364
I told you to explain slowly.

645
00:47:06,448 --> 00:47:09,201
I got a loan using our house
as collateral.

646
00:47:09,618 --> 00:47:12,371
How did you get a loan
without a certificate of Father's seal?

647
00:47:12,829 --> 00:47:16,375
I just did what Min-gi Han told me to do.

648
00:47:16,458 --> 00:47:18,252
But that bastard turned out to be

649
00:47:18,835 --> 00:47:20,879
a con artist!

650
00:47:21,588 --> 00:47:22,756
Does Jae-seok know?

651
00:47:23,257 --> 00:47:25,092
What do I do now, A-jin?

652
00:47:25,384 --> 00:47:27,594
You're the only one in our family
who can resolve this.

653
00:47:27,678 --> 00:47:29,304
I can't reach Jae-gu either.

654
00:47:31,974 --> 00:47:33,308
Gosh, seriously.

655
00:47:37,813 --> 00:47:41,149
Ji-hu, aren't you happy that
I've been picking you up these days?

656
00:47:41,441 --> 00:47:42,526
Yeah, I am.

657
00:47:43,485 --> 00:47:45,571
-You should eat, too.
-Okay.

658
00:47:49,491 --> 00:47:50,993
-Ji-hu.
-Yeah?

659
00:47:51,201 --> 00:47:53,912
You're the happiest when all three
of us are living together, aren't you?

660
00:47:54,079 --> 00:47:55,247
I am, but what's the use?

661
00:47:55,497 --> 00:47:56,498
We can do that again.

662
00:47:57,666 --> 00:47:59,376
Then say this to your mom.

663
00:48:00,002 --> 00:48:02,379
Tell her that you really want to
live happily ever after

664
00:48:02,546 --> 00:48:03,839
with your mom and dad.

665
00:48:04,214 --> 00:48:06,091
-So just...
-Should I cry?

666
00:48:08,010 --> 00:48:12,097
I'm just saying, you have to do that
to move your mom's heart.

667
00:48:13,015 --> 00:48:15,767
Dad, have you read Snow White?

668
00:48:16,476 --> 00:48:19,021
I haven't. There are seven
dwarves in that story.

669
00:48:19,104 --> 00:48:20,689
I don't like books with lots of guys.

670
00:48:24,776 --> 00:48:26,028
I'm just kidding.

671
00:48:30,324 --> 00:48:32,826
-I've read it.
-Don't make jokes like that.

672
00:48:33,035 --> 00:48:35,078
Is that the kind of joke a dad
should make to his daughter?

673
00:48:35,829 --> 00:48:38,665
In that story, the queen keeps
making the same mistake.

674
00:48:39,124 --> 00:48:42,377
At first, she tries to kill
Snow White with a hunter,

675
00:48:42,461 --> 00:48:44,379
and then she tries to
kill her with a poisoned apple.

676
00:48:44,463 --> 00:48:47,591
She did. Just because her mirror
told her that Snow White

677
00:48:47,674 --> 00:48:48,842
is prettier than her.

678
00:48:48,967 --> 00:48:50,218
That woman's hopeless.

679
00:48:50,594 --> 00:48:52,554
I noticed that people
repeat the same mistakes.

680
00:48:52,763 --> 00:48:55,349
-That's right. They do.
-And Mom knows that.

681
00:48:57,059 --> 00:48:59,102
Mom won't trust you from now on

682
00:48:59,353 --> 00:49:01,355
because you made a really big mistake.

683
00:49:01,980 --> 00:49:03,273
Ji-hu, you can't do this to me.

684
00:49:03,357 --> 00:49:06,068
Dad, I'm in a difficult position.

685
00:49:06,526 --> 00:49:08,570
I can't just think of myself
in this situation.

686
00:49:09,488 --> 00:49:11,990
If I think about Mom's life, I can't...

687
00:49:12,741 --> 00:49:14,034
accept your request.

688
00:49:14,868 --> 00:49:17,788
Who's the one person that your mom
and dad cherish the most?

689
00:49:18,413 --> 00:49:21,249
-It's you.
-If you knew that, why did you do it?

690
00:49:23,418 --> 00:49:26,546
Give it a rest. Mom gave you a chance.

691
00:49:26,630 --> 00:49:28,173
She didn't completely cut you off.

692
00:49:30,425 --> 00:49:32,177
Dad, you need to grow up some more.

693
00:49:32,386 --> 00:49:34,346
You're still too immature.

694
00:49:35,597 --> 00:49:36,640
Hurry up and eat.

695
00:49:39,601 --> 00:49:40,852
I don't have an appetite.

696
00:49:48,276 --> 00:49:52,072
I've been watching over him
because A-jin asked me to.

697
00:49:52,155 --> 00:49:55,033
You can go. I'll watch over Father.

698
00:49:55,701 --> 00:49:57,494
-Can I do that?
-Yes.

699
00:50:20,392 --> 00:50:21,643
Gosh, you scared me!

700
00:50:22,102 --> 00:50:23,061
You scared me!

701
00:50:23,311 --> 00:50:26,815
I've been waiting for you. Your man
and my daughter are at home.

702
00:50:27,107 --> 00:50:28,483
Give them some more time together.

703
00:50:29,192 --> 00:50:30,819
Let's take this opportunity to talk.

704
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:40,495
Let's just talk here.

705
00:50:40,871 --> 00:50:44,332
If we go to a nearby cafe,
we'll become a spectacle.

706
00:50:45,584 --> 00:50:48,670
And we're not friendly enough
to drive somewhere far together.

707
00:50:52,716 --> 00:50:55,135
You know you'll lose
even if you sue me, right?

708
00:50:56,136 --> 00:50:59,347
You won't just lose, but you might
have to compensate me, too.

709
00:51:05,395 --> 00:51:08,190
I guess everyone can be foolish sometimes.

710
00:51:09,399 --> 00:51:10,901
I was foolish

711
00:51:11,401 --> 00:51:14,196
for introducing a pretty artist
to my husband without a worry.

712
00:51:15,197 --> 00:51:17,574
And you were foolish for signing
an agreement without reading it.

713
00:51:18,825 --> 00:51:20,368
So get out of the house
as soon as possible.

714
00:51:21,787 --> 00:51:24,456
You're too embarrassed to live
in this apartment anyway.

715
00:51:24,664 --> 00:51:27,751
It's not fair. What did I do
that was so wrong?

716
00:51:30,504 --> 00:51:34,424
You really don't seem to know
what you did wrong.

717
00:51:35,801 --> 00:51:39,179
You're so clueless,
but at least God gave you

718
00:51:39,262 --> 00:51:40,430
artistic talents.

719
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:44,518
Let's make a deal.

720
00:51:46,561 --> 00:51:49,773
I'll send you to a New York art exhibit
as the artist representing our gallery.

721
00:51:51,858 --> 00:51:55,570
Your stance as an artist will change as
soon as you show your paintings there.

722
00:51:55,654 --> 00:51:57,906
The prices of your paintings
will significantly increase, too.

723
00:52:00,242 --> 00:52:01,451
So when do you want to move out?

724
00:52:01,952 --> 00:52:03,745
I'd like you to move out
as you leave for New York.

725
00:52:09,167 --> 00:52:10,919
And what are you going to do
about Jae-seok Ahn?

726
00:52:12,420 --> 00:52:13,588
I'll give him back to you.

727
00:52:14,422 --> 00:52:16,049
Are you returning him? Hey.

728
00:52:17,843 --> 00:52:19,302
All sales are final, ma'am.

729
00:52:19,386 --> 00:52:21,721
You can have Jae-seok Ahn back

730
00:52:21,805 --> 00:52:24,349
but please give me back my painting.

731
00:52:24,432 --> 00:52:25,517
You better shut it.

732
00:52:25,725 --> 00:52:29,104
Please give me back my painting.
That was one of my early works.

733
00:52:29,396 --> 00:52:31,314
Jae-seok Ahn was
one of my early works, too!

734
00:52:32,274 --> 00:52:34,568
Ma'am, I made a mistake.

735
00:52:34,776 --> 00:52:35,986
Don't you want to go to New York?

736
00:52:42,117 --> 00:52:43,159
Get out.

737
00:52:43,743 --> 00:52:46,246
Buy yourself a cup ramen at a
convenience store before you go inside.

738
00:52:46,371 --> 00:52:47,497
Then you'll be right on time.

739
00:52:51,418 --> 00:52:52,460
Aren't you getting out?

740
00:53:10,145 --> 00:53:13,690
Seoul is infested with people. Jeez.

741
00:53:17,110 --> 00:53:18,945
People of Seoul...

742
00:53:20,572 --> 00:53:22,282
I have a lot of money.

743
00:53:23,408 --> 00:53:24,618
I'm rich.

744
00:53:26,620 --> 00:53:27,621
But...

745
00:53:28,663 --> 00:53:30,957
I'm not happy at all.

746
00:53:34,836 --> 00:53:37,964
What can I do to become happy?

747
00:53:39,507 --> 00:53:41,509
What do I have to do to become happy?

748
00:53:45,555 --> 00:53:48,975
What am I supposed to do to become happy?

749
00:53:51,937 --> 00:53:55,815
I'm not happy at all.

750
00:54:08,370 --> 00:54:11,373
I'm not happy at all.

751
00:54:22,175 --> 00:54:26,179
Mom, Dad said he'll drop me off
at Grandma's, so I'm leaving.

752
00:54:26,763 --> 00:54:28,473
See you tomorrow. I love you.

753
00:54:31,184 --> 00:54:32,811
I managed to get this house back...

754
00:54:34,270 --> 00:54:35,772
but what will I do about their house?

755
00:55:03,466 --> 00:55:06,553
What do you think you're doing? You thief.

756
00:55:06,803 --> 00:55:09,556
Wait! Wait a minute!
Listen to me carefully.

757
00:55:09,889 --> 00:55:12,642
This family is doomed.
This household is done for.

758
00:55:13,101 --> 00:55:15,103
-So you should wake up, too.
-What?

759
00:55:16,021 --> 00:55:19,607
Jae-hui Ahn, that crazy bitch gave
this house to the bank as collateral!

760
00:55:19,733 --> 00:55:20,692
It's over!

761
00:55:21,443 --> 00:55:24,029
-Where are you going?
-Ouch! Jeez!

762
00:56:01,733 --> 00:56:03,276
You bitch!

763
00:56:08,239 --> 00:56:10,116
Your habit of slapping people
hasn't changed.

764
00:56:10,450 --> 00:56:11,326
Give it back.

765
00:56:13,578 --> 00:56:15,497
You just tried to kill
Mr. Chairman, didn't you?

766
00:56:15,747 --> 00:56:17,415
-No, I didn't!
-What do you mean you didn't?

767
00:56:18,124 --> 00:56:19,125
I saw it all.

768
00:56:19,626 --> 00:56:20,585
I wanted to check.

769
00:56:21,669 --> 00:56:23,505
To see if Father actually collapsed.

770
00:56:29,552 --> 00:56:31,888
-Jae-hui, you should go home.
-You can go.

771
00:56:32,305 --> 00:56:34,307
I have nothing to do
with your household anymore.

772
00:56:34,390 --> 00:56:35,558
That's why you should leave.

773
00:56:37,060 --> 00:56:38,478
The house has been seized!

774
00:56:39,229 --> 00:56:41,815
-What did you say?
-You need to hurry home.

775
00:56:50,990 --> 00:56:52,075
Bok-ja Park.

776
00:56:54,494 --> 00:56:56,371
Are you back for good?

777
00:57:00,834 --> 00:57:04,003
Okay. I'll come back.

778
00:57:05,255 --> 00:57:08,383
But, I have one condition.

779
00:57:10,844 --> 00:57:11,761
I...

780
00:57:16,266 --> 00:57:19,853
need you to make me just like you.

781
00:57:21,729 --> 00:57:22,564
I...

782
00:57:24,149 --> 00:57:25,191
I...

783
00:57:27,527 --> 00:57:29,487
want you to make me just like you.

784
00:57:30,238 --> 00:57:33,700
A-jin Woo, make me just like you.

785
00:57:37,036 --> 00:57:37,954
Then...

786
00:57:40,123 --> 00:57:41,207
I'll...

787
00:57:42,292 --> 00:57:43,918
help you save Mr. Chairman.

788
00:57:49,215 --> 00:57:50,383
I'll do that.

789
00:58:14,157 --> 00:58:15,492
Can you do as I say?

790
00:58:15,867 --> 00:58:17,702
Help Father wake up.

791
00:58:17,911 --> 00:58:21,539
She'll probably leave me
if I wake up, right?

792
00:58:21,623 --> 00:58:24,209
Do you want to get your money back? Or...

793
00:58:24,626 --> 00:58:27,295
is it her heart that you want back?

794
00:58:27,462 --> 00:58:29,339
You'll have to see me in court.

795
00:58:29,589 --> 00:58:31,674
Aren't you colluding with Mr. Min-gi Han?

796
00:58:31,758 --> 00:58:33,593
I must take all the money she has.

797
00:58:33,676 --> 00:58:35,929
I cannot let a woman like her
enter the upper class

798
00:58:36,012 --> 00:58:37,388
without shedding a drop of blood.

799
00:58:37,472 --> 00:58:39,766
I couldn't stand her
even the moment I first saw her.

800
00:58:39,891 --> 00:58:41,434
I'll do my best.

801
00:58:43,394 --> 00:58:44,646
I'm going crazy!

802
00:58:44,729 --> 00:58:47,482
Sue that con man
and focus on getting the money back.

803
00:58:47,565 --> 00:58:50,318
Please make sure Ms. Woo won't have
to worry about your family anymore.

804
00:58:50,401 --> 00:58:52,737
She looks exhausted these days
because she's been working so much.

805
00:58:52,862 --> 00:58:54,614
Is there any word from Jae-gu?

806
00:58:54,697 --> 00:58:56,282
I think he's dead.

807
00:58:56,616 --> 00:59:00,495
I don't want to live with human trash
like you people in the same house.

808
00:59:00,620 --> 00:59:03,122
That house is mine now.

809
00:59:04,415 --> 00:59:07,585
I thought it was strange that she
came back. That bitch tried to kill Dad!

810
00:59:07,794 --> 00:59:10,630
Dad lost consciousness after eating
blowfish porridge she gave him!

811
00:59:19,681 --> 00:59:21,849
Eat lots, my love.

812
00:59:29,524 --> 00:59:30,483
Don't...

813
00:59:33,861 --> 00:59:35,363
Don't lay a finger on that house.

814
00:59:36,072 --> 00:59:40,285
Our company would like to create
a special line for the upcoming season.

815
00:59:46,916 --> 00:59:48,835
Why is she still so confident,

816
00:59:50,169 --> 00:59:51,963
even though she lost everything?

817
00:59:57,719 --> 01:00:00,179
-Pardon?
-I got a loan using our house

818
01:00:00,305 --> 01:00:01,472
as collateral.

819
01:00:01,556 --> 01:00:03,891
I was tricked, A-jin. What do I do?

820
01:00:04,475 --> 01:00:06,561
I noticed that people
repeat the same mistakes.

821
01:00:06,686 --> 01:00:08,938
-That's right. They do.
-And Mom knows that.

822
01:00:09,022 --> 01:00:10,857
Dad, you need to grow up some more.

823
01:00:10,940 --> 01:00:12,942
You're still too immature.

824
01:00:13,109 --> 01:00:14,110
Hurry up and eat.

825
01:00:16,654 --> 01:00:18,448
Are you back for good?

826
01:00:18,656 --> 01:00:19,782
I have one condition.

827
01:00:20,867 --> 01:00:24,329
I need you to make me just like you.

828
01:00:24,829 --> 01:00:26,831
