1
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:44,252
VICE-CHAIRWOMAN JI-YEONG PARK

2
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:02,812
Hey, you bitch.

3
00:01:03,104 --> 00:01:04,355
Are you looking down on me?

4
00:01:06,357 --> 00:01:08,860
Do you think you can just kick
my wife and child out of the house?

5
00:01:14,407 --> 00:01:16,326
Jae-gu! What are you doing?

6
00:01:16,868 --> 00:01:19,329
-Jae-gu, don't.
-Mark my words.

7
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:21,664
I'll kill this bitch today and go to jail.

8
00:01:21,873 --> 00:01:23,500
-Let go! Don't stop me!
-Try to kill me!

9
00:01:24,083 --> 00:01:26,377
Try to kill me! Go on!

10
00:01:26,836 --> 00:01:29,047
Kill me!

11
00:01:52,904 --> 00:01:54,656
What do you think you're doing?

12
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:55,990
I won't let you come in.

13
00:01:56,074 --> 00:01:57,909
Don't listen to her. Go on.

14
00:01:58,743 --> 00:02:00,745
Eat after you've moved everything.

15
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:03,373
And move all the stuff in that room.

16
00:02:03,456 --> 00:02:04,582
-That one?
-Yes.

17
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:07,585
-Where to?
-To the small room over there.

18
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:09,712
-Move all the stuff over there.
-Okay, ma'am.

19
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:14,092
Let's talk after they finish moving.

20
00:02:14,717 --> 00:02:16,219
Hey!

21
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:19,806
You surely know that this house
is under my daughter's name.

22
00:02:20,598 --> 00:02:23,393
Yes, I do. That's why I am taking action.

23
00:02:23,518 --> 00:02:26,437
You shouldn't do such a thing

24
00:02:26,521 --> 00:02:27,981
when the owner has changed.

25
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:32,360
I was wondering where Seong-hui Yun
got her lack of common sense.

26
00:02:32,485 --> 00:02:33,736
I guess she got it from you.

27
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:35,947
-What did you say?
-Shouldn't you stop

28
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:39,200
her ridiculous behavior,

29
00:02:39,325 --> 00:02:41,244
especially when she's young and talented?

30
00:02:41,661 --> 00:02:43,413
-Hey!
-I will explain the situation clearly

31
00:02:43,746 --> 00:02:46,791
that your daughter
and yourself have got into,

32
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:48,376
and I will tell you what to do from now.

33
00:02:48,459 --> 00:02:49,752
What?

34
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:51,796
Your daughter is a lover

35
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:55,091
of my unworthy husband.

36
00:02:55,258 --> 00:02:56,384
What? Lover?

37
00:02:56,885 --> 00:02:59,137
People normally call them,

38
00:02:59,345 --> 00:03:00,722
bitches!

39
00:03:01,264 --> 00:03:02,765
-You!
-Hey!

40
00:03:03,474 --> 00:03:05,268
How dare you call me that!

41
00:03:05,768 --> 00:03:09,147
I'm not a person
that you can talk down to.

42
00:03:12,817 --> 00:03:15,153
To what country does Dokdo belong to?

43
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:18,698
What's this nonsense?

44
00:03:19,657 --> 00:03:20,992
It belongs to Korea of course.

45
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:25,330
Then how can you claim that
this house is your daughter's?

46
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:30,460
If you have any conscience,
think about who this house belongs to.

47
00:03:30,793 --> 00:03:34,088
Do you think it's yours because
it has your name on it?

48
00:03:36,007 --> 00:03:39,886
Speak up. Do you really think
that this is your home? Do you really?

49
00:03:42,013 --> 00:03:44,015
What does this house
have anything to do with Dokdo?

50
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:48,269
It's the same, since having a flag on it

51
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:50,063
makes it seem like it's yours.

52
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:56,653
-Were you really going to stab her?
-No. Of course not.

53
00:03:56,986 --> 00:03:58,446
I didn't ask you.

54
00:03:58,655 --> 00:04:01,074
Yes. I was.

55
00:04:01,157 --> 00:04:03,326
-Jae-gu!
-So, you were going to stab her...

56
00:04:03,993 --> 00:04:06,371
Did you mean to kill her?

57
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:07,497
Yes.

58
00:04:07,997 --> 00:04:09,624
-Then this is attempted murder.
-Detective.

59
00:04:09,707 --> 00:04:13,294
Jae-gu is so angry
that he doesn't realize what he's saying.

60
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:15,463
If you write everything he says
in that report...

61
00:04:17,632 --> 00:04:18,549
Excuse me.

62
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:22,095
What?

63
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:25,473
What did you say?
A-jin broke into your house?

64
00:04:27,225 --> 00:04:30,186
Is your mother with you?

65
00:04:33,356 --> 00:04:34,565
Ji-hu is not home, is she?

66
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:37,026
Goodness. That's a relief.

67
00:04:38,236 --> 00:04:40,530
I am busy right now.

68
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:42,365
How can I take care of things over there?

69
00:04:42,448 --> 00:04:44,951
I will make everything more complicated.

70
00:04:46,035 --> 00:04:48,871
Hey! How come you call the police
for such thing?

71
00:04:49,497 --> 00:04:51,291
They are busy, you know.

72
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:54,752
How can you let the police meddle in
such small family matters?

73
00:04:55,336 --> 00:04:57,005
What? The police have arrived?

74
00:04:57,922 --> 00:04:58,840
Shit.

75
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:05,221
Hey! Hello?

76
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:08,808
The police have arrived.

77
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:12,520
-You pathetic bastard!
-You call me a pathetic bastard?

78
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:14,480
You don't deserve to call me pathetic.

79
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:16,441
Are you cheating? Pathetic.

80
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:20,028
Hey! Go home and quarrel.

81
00:05:20,778 --> 00:05:24,365
If the action was carried out on purpose,

82
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:26,451
it qualifies as an attempted murder.

83
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:28,661
Even if the murder was stopped.

84
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,872
So make a settlement, at least.

85
00:05:31,622 --> 00:05:34,000
I will not settle.

86
00:05:34,792 --> 00:05:35,960
No, he will.

87
00:05:36,044 --> 00:05:37,837
Yes? Yes.

88
00:05:39,922 --> 00:05:42,675
Mr. Ahn called for a settlement...

89
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:45,470
Nonsense. How rude.

90
00:05:45,928 --> 00:05:48,848
Tell him to come and beg for forgiveness.

91
00:05:52,101 --> 00:05:55,354
-Gosh.
-You need to come and beg...

92
00:05:55,438 --> 00:05:57,648
I think my hips are dislocated.

93
00:05:57,732 --> 00:06:00,526
-Gosh! Hey, Mr. Park.
-Yes?

94
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:03,446
Let me talk to the head of the factory.

95
00:06:03,946 --> 00:06:07,492
I am worried sick that the factory
may not be running properly.

96
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:11,120
Ma'am!

97
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:13,289
Every movement hurts like hell.

98
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:16,042
Something must be wrong. Goodness.

99
00:06:27,386 --> 00:06:29,097
I came to visit A-jin Woo's residence.

100
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:30,890
What's the building and room number?

101
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:32,475
Right. It's...

102
00:06:34,477 --> 00:06:37,188
It's building 105, room 303.

103
00:06:37,688 --> 00:06:39,357
Look at this property certificate!

104
00:06:39,482 --> 00:06:41,609
The owner of this property is my daughter.

105
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:44,320
This woman is moving in
without her permission.

106
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:48,282
The first owner of this property
is Jae-seok Ahn.

107
00:06:48,658 --> 00:06:50,743
This person is my husband,

108
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:53,121
but he had an affair with her.

109
00:06:53,788 --> 00:06:57,166
So, he unlawfully put her name
to this property.

110
00:06:57,667 --> 00:06:59,752
Do you understand the situation?

111
00:07:00,002 --> 00:07:02,964
Well it is my duty to solve this,
since we're here.

112
00:07:03,756 --> 00:07:06,926
Honestly, the owner of this property

113
00:07:07,009 --> 00:07:08,511
is under this woman so it's her house.

114
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:10,513
That's not necessarily true.

115
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:13,349
Hello.

116
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:15,726
I am attorney Gi-ho Kang.

117
00:07:16,477 --> 00:07:19,439
If you run into a ridiculous incident,

118
00:07:19,814 --> 00:07:20,773
call me.

119
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:26,154
I am the legal consultant of
the actual owner of this house, A-jin Woo.

120
00:07:27,155 --> 00:07:29,907
There is currently a lawsuit concerning

121
00:07:29,991 --> 00:07:31,200
the possession of this house.

122
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:35,288
It's currently under dispute.

123
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:39,208
In other words, we have yet

124
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:41,169
to decide who the trespasser is.

125
00:07:41,586 --> 00:07:43,588
So, the police have no right to
decide who the owner is.

126
00:07:43,921 --> 00:07:46,549
Well, it seems like
we shouldn't get ourselves involved.

127
00:07:47,508 --> 00:07:50,970
Since this is a family matter,
sue her instead of calling the police.

128
00:07:51,387 --> 00:07:52,388
Goodbye.

129
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:55,099
-Hey.
-Take care!

130
00:07:57,185 --> 00:07:59,353
-Take this.
-You didn't have to.

131
00:08:00,938 --> 00:08:03,274
So thoughtful of you.
You bought the best tissue paper.

132
00:08:03,816 --> 00:08:06,027
-Did you finish moving everything?
-Still a long way to go.

133
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:08,404
Ma'am, where should I put this bed?

134
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:10,198
Put that in the main bedroom.

135
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,116
What about the bed in the main bedroom?

136
00:08:13,409 --> 00:08:14,994
I will help you move it.

137
00:08:15,369 --> 00:08:19,290
Will you? Then please move it to
the corner room over there.

138
00:08:20,124 --> 00:08:21,542
Let's move this together.

139
00:08:25,129 --> 00:08:27,548
So, Ms. Woo is moving into that house?

140
00:08:27,632 --> 00:08:30,092
Yes. I need to get going.

141
00:08:30,468 --> 00:08:31,511
They're moving.

142
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:34,388
Oh my. She is strong.

143
00:08:34,472 --> 00:08:36,641
She insisted on moving in? Unbelievable.

144
00:08:37,141 --> 00:08:39,810
Did you know that Ms. Park
ended up in the hospital?

145
00:08:40,102 --> 00:08:41,854
-Why?
-Why do you think it is?

146
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:44,440
Mr. Chairman's oldest son
went on a rampage in her office.

147
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:45,608
My goodness.

148
00:08:45,733 --> 00:08:48,861
Did they find the person
who beat up Bong-sik Kim, the golfer?

149
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:52,240
Everyone is dismissed! Lunchtime is over.

150
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:56,619
The ladies will be wondering
what we're doing here.

151
00:08:56,869 --> 00:08:58,162
Go back to your workplaces.

152
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:00,498
I heard the wife of Bong-sik got pregnant.

153
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:03,626
Gosh, really? I thought
they couldn't have a baby.

154
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:06,587
Yes. But suddenly she has a baby.

155
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:10,216
Then who's the father?

156
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:13,511
It can't be Dr. Jang.

157
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:15,513
Then what happened?

158
00:09:15,596 --> 00:09:17,974
Blocked caller ID
Your wife is pregnant.

159
00:09:26,732 --> 00:09:30,194
I received a ridiculous message.
Do you know anything about it?

160
00:09:33,364 --> 00:09:37,034
It isn't true, is it?

161
00:09:38,953 --> 00:09:39,870
It is.

162
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,291
-What?
-It turns out that I'm fertile.

163
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:46,752
-You...
-Yun-jae!

164
00:09:48,671 --> 00:09:51,549
You couldn't get me pregnant,
but he could.

165
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:54,677
It seems that you were the problem.

166
00:09:56,178 --> 00:09:57,763
It turns out that I'm not infertile.

167
00:09:59,974 --> 00:10:02,643
Are you sure that Yun-jae is your son?

168
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:03,978
Mom!

169
00:10:04,729 --> 00:10:06,063
My son.

170
00:10:09,734 --> 00:10:12,820
You ate chocolate again, didn't you?
Did you brush your teeth afterward?

171
00:10:13,154 --> 00:10:16,824
Look at this. Do you want to
go to the dentist again?

172
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:20,494
-No.
-Then you should brush your teeth.

173
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:23,581
Check with me again
after you've brushed your teeth. Okay?

174
00:10:24,206 --> 00:10:25,708
Good boy. Go on.

175
00:10:30,171 --> 00:10:31,547
Who was the bastard?

176
00:10:31,964 --> 00:10:34,717
Is that important? It's not your
business, since it's not your kid.

177
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:38,929
We're neither married nor enemies.

178
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:41,057
It's just weird between us.

179
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:43,726
We need closure,

180
00:10:44,268 --> 00:10:46,562
and it seems like we're getting one.

181
00:10:46,896 --> 00:10:50,107
Jeez. You don't even seem scared.

182
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:53,569
You've become bold these days.
The bastard must be wealthy.

183
00:10:53,736 --> 00:10:54,695
Watch your language.

184
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:58,908
Even a worm will react
when you step on it.

185
00:11:00,117 --> 00:11:02,995
Shut up before I show Yun-jae the video,

186
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:05,206
and do as I say.

187
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:18,344
Goodness. I'm so tired.

188
00:11:20,262 --> 00:11:21,305
Dad.

189
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:23,682
I want plastic surgery.

190
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:26,560
You don't need one. You're perfect.

191
00:11:26,644 --> 00:11:29,980
My eyes are turning back.

192
00:11:30,439 --> 00:11:32,525
I want to redo the double eyelid surgery.

193
00:11:32,608 --> 00:11:34,527
You don't need to. You're pretty.

194
00:11:38,489 --> 00:11:41,826
I'll introduce you
to an acquaintance of mine

195
00:11:41,992 --> 00:11:43,869
who's a plastic surgeon.
Get it done there.

196
00:11:46,497 --> 00:11:48,207
-Thank you, dad.
-Okay.

197
00:11:50,126 --> 00:11:51,168
Okay.

198
00:11:51,752 --> 00:11:54,046
Okay. Go on.

199
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:57,174
-You're going to come this evening, right?
-I can't.

200
00:11:57,675 --> 00:11:58,884
I need to go home.

201
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:00,636
Okay.

202
00:12:05,015 --> 00:12:07,393
You needed to see me? What's the matter?

203
00:12:07,601 --> 00:12:08,686
Mun-tak.

204
00:12:10,938 --> 00:12:13,357
My wife is pregnant.

205
00:12:13,858 --> 00:12:17,403
Gosh! Good for you!
A late child. Good job.

206
00:12:17,611 --> 00:12:18,612
It's not my child.

207
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:20,781
What?

208
00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:22,366
Mun-tak,

209
00:12:23,492 --> 00:12:24,577
help me.

210
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:27,163
What did you say? That crazy bastard.

211
00:12:27,371 --> 00:12:29,039
Who is he to behave like that over there?

212
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:32,376
I can't forgive that punk this time!

213
00:12:33,169 --> 00:12:36,088
Mark my words. I will never forgive him.

214
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:39,216
That son of a bitch.
I will put him in jail.

215
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:47,099
Honey. Are you all right?

216
00:12:48,934 --> 00:12:50,311
You are such an angel.

217
00:12:50,811 --> 00:12:53,397
Okay. I'll visit you soon.

218
00:12:54,356 --> 00:12:55,191
Okay.

219
00:12:58,652 --> 00:13:00,863
At least you should go and beg for mercy.

220
00:13:01,238 --> 00:13:04,033
Despite your inhumane actions,

221
00:13:04,366 --> 00:13:05,659
she told me to show you mercy.

222
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:08,370
She also told me to forgive your husband.

223
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:13,876
She's totally different from you
two shameful human beings.

224
00:13:23,385 --> 00:13:26,096
Jin-hee, did my mom finish moving?

225
00:13:27,932 --> 00:13:30,768
I want to live there, too. Can't I?

226
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:33,521
You can’t.

227
00:13:34,104 --> 00:13:35,606
You just stay at grandma's.

228
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:39,276
But, no one is on her side.
I should be with her.

229
00:13:40,945 --> 00:13:44,240
Ji-hu, think about how she would feel.

230
00:13:44,698 --> 00:13:48,077
She wouldn't want you to
come to such a place.

231
00:13:48,619 --> 00:13:51,205
Okay. I understand.

232
00:13:52,289 --> 00:13:55,626
But from now on, do I have to hate my dad

233
00:13:55,709 --> 00:13:56,961
or forgive him?

234
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:00,965
I don't know.

235
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:04,426
It’s your decision, but it's a hard one.

236
00:14:05,594 --> 00:14:08,472
Those kinds of decisions
are hard to make, right?

237
00:14:11,725 --> 00:14:12,726
Ji-hu.

238
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:16,063
Jin-hee, I am so sad.

239
00:14:28,325 --> 00:14:30,494
I feel so sorry for my mom.

240
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:32,913
It must be hard to be alone.

241
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:38,502
Actually, I like the leader of our class,

242
00:14:39,044 --> 00:14:40,337
Ji-hun Choi.

243
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:43,799
I get so angry even

244
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:45,551
when he smiles at other girls.

245
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:48,554
How hard would it be for mom?

246
00:14:48,804 --> 00:14:52,725
She couldn't even tell me
that she's angry with him.

247
00:14:59,106 --> 00:15:01,191
Ji-hu, don't cry.

248
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,905
My dad crossed the line.

249
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:10,242
But I can't hate him,

250
00:15:11,243 --> 00:15:14,079
because that'll make my mom sadder.

251
00:15:15,873 --> 00:15:18,292
Your father is so lucky

252
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:21,045
to have a daughter like you.

253
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:25,883
Don't tell mom that I cried.

254
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:27,635
Of course.

255
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:29,303
Promise me.

256
00:15:37,061 --> 00:15:39,605
My little puppy,
did you come back from school?

257
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:42,608
-Yes, grandma.
-Go and wash your hands.

258
00:15:42,691 --> 00:15:45,486
-I bought some doughnuts for you to eat.
-Okay.

259
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:49,865
Ji-hu has science lessons
later this evening. I'll pick her up then.

260
00:15:50,407 --> 00:15:52,034
Jin-hee. Are you leaving?

261
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:54,495
Yes. I need to help A-jin move.

262
00:15:55,412 --> 00:15:56,997
Let's talk for a minute.

263
00:16:00,584 --> 00:16:02,795
What? Is that true?

264
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:07,216
Yes. She doesn't want you to know.

265
00:16:07,341 --> 00:16:08,634
So you should pretend.

266
00:16:08,717 --> 00:16:11,929
How can she expect to
hide something like this? I'm not stupid.

267
00:16:12,596 --> 00:16:15,724
If she's moving
because of Ji-hu's new school,

268
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:19,770
keeping her here doesn't make any sense.

269
00:16:20,312 --> 00:16:22,064
How can she think
that I wouldn't find out?

270
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:25,734
I will end that bastard.

271
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:28,445
I think you'll have to kneel.

272
00:16:28,737 --> 00:16:29,947
Who? Me?

273
00:16:30,197 --> 00:16:33,951
No. Your brother, Jae-gu.

274
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:37,746
She insisted that she won't settle
until Jae-gu kneels before her.

275
00:16:38,122 --> 00:16:40,332
How can he kneel?

276
00:16:40,582 --> 00:16:43,335
A man shouldn't kneel so easily.

277
00:16:47,131 --> 00:16:48,132
Mother.

278
00:16:49,633 --> 00:16:52,720
Is that true? It isn't true, is it?

279
00:16:53,303 --> 00:16:56,682
Is it true that A-jin is going
through such pain?

280
00:16:57,391 --> 00:16:58,934
Is it true

281
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:01,770
that you cheated on my daughter
and went on to live with her?

282
00:17:02,438 --> 00:17:04,023
Is it true? Is it?

283
00:17:08,068 --> 00:17:11,030
My gosh! You bastard!

284
00:17:11,947 --> 00:17:13,699
How can you do this?

285
00:17:13,991 --> 00:17:16,702
What did you say when you came to me,
asking to marry my daughter?

286
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:19,913
You told me that you will not
let a single tear drop from her eyes.

287
00:17:20,789 --> 00:17:22,249
Mother. Well...

288
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:24,293
Things took

289
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:27,171
an unexpected turn.

290
00:17:27,629 --> 00:17:31,258
How can you let her cry?

291
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:35,179
Mother, I am sorry.

292
00:17:35,345 --> 00:17:37,014
It's all my fault.

293
00:17:41,935 --> 00:17:45,522
But, I won't divorce her.

294
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:49,359
-What?
-I'll never divorce her.

295
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:51,028
Help me, Mother.

296
00:17:52,029 --> 00:17:53,322
I'll protect our family.

297
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:57,159
Are you saying you'll break up with her?

298
00:17:57,701 --> 00:17:59,036
No. Not that.

299
00:17:59,203 --> 00:18:01,955
What? You crazy bastard!

300
00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:04,500
Hey, get up!

301
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:06,960
-Get up!
-Mr. Ahn!

302
00:18:07,044 --> 00:18:08,670
-Get up!
-Ma'am, stop...

303
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:10,714
-Won't you get up?
-Ma'am...

304
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:12,841
-Are you putting on a show? Hey, get up!
-Mr. Ahn!

305
00:18:13,717 --> 00:18:16,053
I'll be going back to my office then.

306
00:18:16,136 --> 00:18:17,763
Okay. Thank you so much for today.

307
00:18:18,013 --> 00:18:19,306
No problem.

308
00:18:20,724 --> 00:18:23,143
Why don't we have
the mind study session here?

309
00:18:23,352 --> 00:18:25,604
-It'll also be a housewarming party.
-That sounds great.

310
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:29,066
-I'm leaving now.
-Okay. Bye.

311
00:18:29,358 --> 00:18:30,442
Bye.

312
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:36,782
The lawyer has left.
Let's go outside and argue with her.

313
00:18:37,032 --> 00:18:38,033
Argue for what?

314
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:39,993
She's alone now.

315
00:18:40,702 --> 00:18:43,455
We need to do something. We can't give up.

316
00:18:43,914 --> 00:18:46,792
-Let's go.
-No. Mom

317
00:18:47,334 --> 00:18:48,585
Let's go.

318
00:18:51,922 --> 00:18:52,965
Goodness.

319
00:18:53,715 --> 00:18:54,842
Gosh. This is...

320
00:18:57,719 --> 00:19:00,597
Hey, you! Come out!

321
00:19:10,774 --> 00:19:13,402
We thought about it,

322
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:15,445
but this is wrong.

323
00:19:16,238 --> 00:19:19,908
I let you go because
I needed some time to think,

324
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:23,328
but this house belongs to my daughter.

325
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:27,708
You're laughing? Why are you laughing?

326
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:32,588
Ma'am, this is a house that
my husband and I bought together.

327
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:35,841
It's under my husband's name,
but it's shared property.

328
00:19:36,091 --> 00:19:39,261
My husband and I are
in a lawsuit for divorce,

329
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:42,139
so there are unresolved disputes
concerning the division of assets.

330
00:19:43,098 --> 00:19:45,934
Thus, 50 percent of this property
belongs to me.

331
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:48,103
Your daughter doesn't own
a single percent of this property.

332
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:51,064
I don't know about that.

333
00:19:52,065 --> 00:19:54,276
Get out! Empty your room!

334
00:19:54,568 --> 00:19:55,444
Empty what?

335
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:57,779
Mom!

336
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:04,286
I thought it was strange of you

337
00:20:04,369 --> 00:20:05,871
to leave Ji-hu when you moved out.

338
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:08,498
I never would have guessed
that this would happen.

339
00:20:12,294 --> 00:20:13,462
Mom, go.

340
00:20:13,837 --> 00:20:16,590
A-jin. There are guests here.

341
00:20:16,757 --> 00:20:19,468
Go buy some briskets, so that
I can cook meat soup for the guests.

342
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:22,137
Radish and leeks, too.

343
00:20:22,429 --> 00:20:23,722
What do you mean "guests"?

344
00:20:24,181 --> 00:20:26,850
Go on! I want to have it.

345
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:30,771
You like meat soup, don't you?

346
00:20:32,189 --> 00:20:33,690
Do you want some fiddleheads in it, too?

347
00:20:34,149 --> 00:20:37,694
Fiddleheads in meat soup?
That's so country-like!

348
00:20:37,986 --> 00:20:38,946
Okay then.

349
00:20:39,947 --> 00:20:43,825
Forget the fiddleheads, and get some fresh
shiitake mushrooms and bean sprouts.

350
00:20:44,785 --> 00:20:46,787
We should tend to our guests.

351
00:20:48,664 --> 00:20:50,958
Go on. Listen to your mom!

352
00:20:53,961 --> 00:20:55,003
Okay.

353
00:21:15,482 --> 00:21:17,776
You bitch.
How dare you set foot on this property.

354
00:21:17,859 --> 00:21:21,029
-Do you want to die?
-You crazy old woman!

355
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:22,614
How dare you hit my daughter?

356
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:26,326
-What? Old woman?
-Oh gosh!

357
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:28,245
A mother should deal with another mother.

358
00:21:28,328 --> 00:21:30,497
I'll punish you for not raising
your kid properly!

359
00:21:30,747 --> 00:21:32,874
-You shameless bitch.
-Hey!

360
00:21:34,543 --> 00:21:37,587
I am planning on being evil
for the first time in my life,

361
00:21:37,671 --> 00:21:40,716
after trying to raise my daughter
as an elegant and dignified woman.

362
00:21:41,633 --> 00:21:43,635
Slip on cow shit and land on dog shit,
you bitches.

363
00:21:43,719 --> 00:21:45,387
Let go!

364
00:21:47,597 --> 00:21:48,849
Jin-hee! Take this bitch away.

365
00:21:49,099 --> 00:21:51,310
-Which bitch?
-The young one!

366
00:21:51,435 --> 00:21:53,478
-Goodness!
-Hey!

367
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:00,944
Are you all insane?

368
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:02,988
How dare you make a fuss
on someone else's property.

369
00:22:30,307 --> 00:22:32,017
I heard that you're hospitalized
for six weeks.

370
00:22:35,395 --> 00:22:36,730
You aren't going to settle, are you?

371
00:22:37,647 --> 00:22:40,150
If a child misbehaves,

372
00:22:40,233 --> 00:22:42,360
a mother should educate him.

373
00:22:43,612 --> 00:22:45,280
That's what a real mother would do.

374
00:22:47,324 --> 00:22:48,450
Don't you think?

375
00:22:48,784 --> 00:22:49,659
Mother?

376
00:22:50,494 --> 00:22:54,331
I don't know who'll kill you,
but it'll happen sooner or later.

377
00:22:55,165 --> 00:22:57,417
If you keep living like that,
there will be no mercy on you.

378
00:23:03,256 --> 00:23:05,550
We were at this cafe

379
00:23:05,884 --> 00:23:07,260
when I gave you the job, right?

380
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:11,181
Didn't I give you 100 million won?

381
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:14,267
I remember it clearly.

382
00:23:14,601 --> 00:23:16,436
I gave you 100 million won in cash.

383
00:23:17,145 --> 00:23:18,480
Don't you remember?

384
00:23:20,357 --> 00:23:21,274
I...

385
00:23:24,277 --> 00:23:25,821
-remember.
-Give it back.

386
00:23:26,947 --> 00:23:28,073
You failed, didn't you?

387
00:23:29,282 --> 00:23:32,536
You told me that you would.

388
00:23:33,453 --> 00:23:34,913
That you'd give it back if you fail.

389
00:23:37,374 --> 00:23:40,502
Ma'am, sorry. Stop this.

390
00:23:40,961 --> 00:23:42,587
-Stop what?
-Stop this.

391
00:23:42,671 --> 00:23:44,506
Why are you doing this?
You haven't met me before.

392
00:23:44,881 --> 00:23:47,509
When did I ever meet you
and receive money?

393
00:23:50,846 --> 00:23:52,889
I am thinking about
how I'm going to use this.

394
00:23:53,807 --> 00:23:56,017
You should be thinking, too.

395
00:24:05,443 --> 00:24:06,736
Shit.

396
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:08,905
That stupid bastard.

397
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:11,241
Can't do anything right.

398
00:24:13,368 --> 00:24:15,620
Since the victim is in bad condition,

399
00:24:16,163 --> 00:24:18,498
and the perpetrator might seek revenge,

400
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:20,417
I asked for

401
00:24:20,917 --> 00:24:23,295
an arrest warrant for the aggressor.

402
00:24:24,171 --> 00:24:25,172
Please settle this quickly.

403
00:24:26,506 --> 00:24:29,426
I won't settle. Lock me up.

404
00:24:29,843 --> 00:24:30,927
I'll live in prison.

405
00:24:35,182 --> 00:24:36,641
This is Team Two of Homicide.

406
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:39,561
What?

407
00:24:40,061 --> 00:24:41,813
Five women are fighting each other?

408
00:24:52,407 --> 00:24:55,994
A-jin, the neighbors called the police.

409
00:24:56,161 --> 00:24:57,746
My goodness! What?

410
00:24:59,122 --> 00:25:00,248
Did you keep them alive?

411
00:25:00,332 --> 00:25:02,459
They are alive. Don't worry.

412
00:25:03,001 --> 00:25:05,337
-We should deal with the police...
-Gosh!

413
00:25:05,754 --> 00:25:07,505
Mom...

414
00:25:07,964 --> 00:25:11,426
Didn't you see this coming when
your husband cheated on you?

415
00:25:12,177 --> 00:25:14,930
How come he wants the house

416
00:25:15,222 --> 00:25:16,765
after all he has done.

417
00:25:19,267 --> 00:25:22,103
Your mom wants meat soup.

418
00:25:23,605 --> 00:25:26,733
I will cook it Gyeongsang province style.

419
00:25:34,115 --> 00:25:36,076
Who's the perpetrator,
and who's the victim?

420
00:25:36,952 --> 00:25:38,578
Just leave. It's a family matter.

421
00:25:38,995 --> 00:25:41,831
Why are we investigating this
if it's just a family matter?

422
00:25:44,709 --> 00:25:45,752
What's going on over there?

423
00:25:48,546 --> 00:25:50,882
Gosh! Why is the password changed?

424
00:25:56,179 --> 00:25:59,099
-What are you doing here?
-What brings you here?

425
00:26:00,267 --> 00:26:01,601
This is my home.

426
00:26:02,644 --> 00:26:03,770
Pardon?

427
00:26:04,896 --> 00:26:06,731
-Take care.
-Okay.

428
00:26:06,815 --> 00:26:08,191
You must be happy to pay taxes,

429
00:26:08,733 --> 00:26:11,778
since you seem to make the most out of it.

430
00:26:12,112 --> 00:26:15,323
I never evade taxes,
even though I break all the other laws.

431
00:26:15,782 --> 00:26:16,825
I pay my taxes fully.

432
00:26:19,452 --> 00:26:20,370
Goodness.

433
00:26:20,662 --> 00:26:22,539
Goodbye.

434
00:26:38,263 --> 00:26:40,932
How are we all gathered here?

435
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:43,184
Did you invite everyone here?

436
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:47,147
Hello. Good to meet you.

437
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:48,815
Jae-seok!

438
00:26:49,733 --> 00:26:53,361
How can you let this happen?

439
00:26:53,987 --> 00:26:55,989
What? Son-in-law?

440
00:26:57,198 --> 00:26:58,700
I'm sorry for this, Mother.

441
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,327
You're sorry?

442
00:27:00,702 --> 00:27:02,662
Who are you apologizing to?

443
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:06,458
Sorry.

444
00:27:06,666 --> 00:27:10,128
Who do you think is
the most unethical person among them?

445
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:16,926
Who do you think is
the most sorrowful person among them?

446
00:27:18,845 --> 00:27:21,306
Sorry.

447
00:27:24,434 --> 00:27:25,435
Well...

448
00:27:26,436 --> 00:27:28,563
How can this happen...

449
00:27:29,564 --> 00:27:31,983
I think Jae-seok is both the

450
00:27:32,567 --> 00:27:35,528
most unethical and the most sorrowful.

451
00:27:37,197 --> 00:27:40,283
Do you think so? I think so, too.

452
00:27:46,539 --> 00:27:47,999
Let's eat together.

453
00:27:48,458 --> 00:27:50,752
You should eat, too.
Jin-hee, come and sit.

454
00:27:51,086 --> 00:27:53,088
-Okay.
-You should eat, too.

455
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:55,840
-Should I?
-Where do you think you're sitting?

456
00:28:03,098 --> 00:28:05,600
They should have made food for us, too.

457
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:07,644
Food should be shared
so that no one will be upset.

458
00:28:07,852 --> 00:28:10,355
We're already upset. We can't be
more upset than we are now.

459
00:28:12,774 --> 00:28:15,985
I hate to be left out for food.

460
00:28:17,112 --> 00:28:18,863
Do you want to get something
to eat outside?

461
00:28:18,947 --> 00:28:21,366
Outside? We need to stay here

462
00:28:21,574 --> 00:28:25,412
or else she will get rid of
all your belongings and paintings.

463
00:28:26,663 --> 00:28:27,997
What do we do?

464
00:28:28,456 --> 00:28:29,958
What is Jae-seok, my son-in-law doing?

465
00:28:30,291 --> 00:28:32,961
Why do you call him that?
We're not married.

466
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:36,172
Well, I have nothing else to call him.

467
00:28:36,714 --> 00:28:39,926
Gosh! What is he planning on doing?

468
00:28:42,053 --> 00:28:43,680
The smell of kimchi

469
00:28:45,265 --> 00:28:46,349
is so good.

470
00:28:46,433 --> 00:28:49,519
There are too many orders for the Pung-suk
kimchi, you need to wait a month.

471
00:28:50,353 --> 00:28:51,938
Yes. Sorry.

472
00:28:54,482 --> 00:28:56,693
Eating, sleeping, and fighting and...

473
00:28:57,068 --> 00:28:58,570
Eating, sleeping, and fighting again...

474
00:28:59,154 --> 00:29:00,488
That’s what life was.

475
00:29:01,114 --> 00:29:04,117
It was as if people were
eating and sleeping to fight.

476
00:29:04,617 --> 00:29:07,829
That's what life was like.

477
00:29:09,998 --> 00:29:11,958
Ma'am, this is Pung-suk's Kitchen.

478
00:29:14,127 --> 00:29:16,963
I am sending you the kimchi,
ginseng kimchi,

479
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:19,174
and Pung-suk roes for the director.

480
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:23,261
I selected all the ingredients myself,
so don't worry and enjoy.

481
00:29:24,179 --> 00:29:27,432
I will take care of
the director's dinner forever.

482
00:29:28,725 --> 00:29:29,559
Okay.

483
00:29:29,642 --> 00:29:31,436
Human desires are endless,

484
00:29:31,936 --> 00:29:34,355
but the most basic and
powerful desire of all

485
00:29:34,689 --> 00:29:37,233
was hunger, without a doubt.

486
00:29:37,442 --> 00:29:40,111
I heard that a new two-lane road on
the way to Chilpo-ri will be constructed.

487
00:29:40,695 --> 00:29:42,447
Don't worry, the information is reliable.

488
00:29:43,531 --> 00:29:47,118
I bet the price of the land will go up.

489
00:29:48,036 --> 00:29:50,872
I'll buy it and refuse to sell it
until they offer me a price.

490
00:29:52,207 --> 00:29:54,501
With the desire of hunger as her leverage,

491
00:29:54,709 --> 00:29:57,337
she was on her way to success.

492
00:30:01,674 --> 00:30:03,259
Why did you come home today?

493
00:30:03,468 --> 00:30:06,137
I'm going to come home every day
until Do-hyeon goes abroad to study.

494
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:08,681
You're such a good dad.

495
00:30:09,933 --> 00:30:11,559
Do you know that Gyeong-hui is pregnant?

496
00:30:13,144 --> 00:30:14,771
How do you know that?

497
00:30:16,981 --> 00:30:18,525
I heard that Bong-sik is not the father.

498
00:30:19,359 --> 00:30:21,444
Who's is it then?

499
00:30:23,446 --> 00:30:25,156
You must know since you two are close.

500
00:30:26,407 --> 00:30:27,492
I don't know.

501
00:30:28,368 --> 00:30:31,579
But are you and Bong-sik
close enough to talk about such things?

502
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:36,167
He wanted to break the bones of the man
who had an affair with his wife.

503
00:30:38,878 --> 00:30:40,547
You know who it is, don't you?

504
00:30:42,423 --> 00:30:43,925
I really don't know.

505
00:30:55,311 --> 00:30:56,354
Hello?

506
00:30:56,688 --> 00:30:59,983
-Hey, it's me.
-What's up?

507
00:31:00,942 --> 00:31:04,237
My husband knows that
Gyeong-hui is pregnant.

508
00:31:07,657 --> 00:31:09,117
How does he know?

509
00:31:09,367 --> 00:31:10,827
That's what I'm saying.

510
00:31:11,536 --> 00:31:13,913
I think Bong-sik told my husband.

511
00:31:15,331 --> 00:31:17,834
The problem is that the kid

512
00:31:18,418 --> 00:31:20,086
is not Bong-sik's.

513
00:31:22,088 --> 00:31:23,464
-What?
-Gi-ok.

514
00:31:24,132 --> 00:31:25,425
What do we do?

515
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:31,472
Hang up,
I need to collect my thoughts first.

516
00:31:56,581 --> 00:31:58,499
Oh my, am I getting prettier?

517
00:31:58,666 --> 00:31:59,834
Yes, you are.

518
00:32:00,001 --> 00:32:02,420
Come here. Let me give you a hug.

519
00:32:13,681 --> 00:32:15,975
Ji-hu, how was your day?

520
00:32:18,269 --> 00:32:19,354
I see.

521
00:32:20,313 --> 00:32:23,358
Okay. Did you take your vitamins?

522
00:32:25,401 --> 00:32:29,030
Okay. I love you, too.

523
00:32:37,163 --> 00:32:39,999
A-jin. I am not going to divorce you.

524
00:32:40,833 --> 00:32:41,918
Shut your mouth.

525
00:32:42,043 --> 00:32:44,671
What I want is coexistence.

526
00:33:15,034 --> 00:33:18,162
Coexistence is what you wanted.
How do you like it so far?

527
00:33:18,621 --> 00:33:20,581
This is not what I meant.

528
00:33:21,457 --> 00:33:22,375
Then?

529
00:33:35,596 --> 00:33:36,848
Don't ever go in!

530
00:33:37,724 --> 00:33:39,517
Your filthy mind and body...

531
00:33:40,101 --> 00:33:43,021
I don't want you to contaminate her.
It's disgusting.

532
00:33:43,312 --> 00:33:44,397
Where do I sleep then?

533
00:33:45,356 --> 00:33:47,567
Here. You can walk, can't you? Go on.

534
00:33:48,234 --> 00:33:50,611
But this is wrong.

535
00:33:51,904 --> 00:33:54,323
You're the one to talk!

536
00:33:54,907 --> 00:33:56,367
It makes me very sick.

537
00:33:56,617 --> 00:33:57,952
Do you really have to do this?

538
00:33:58,286 --> 00:34:00,204
Look what you've done.

539
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:02,915
Why do Ji-hu and I have to be separated,

540
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:05,626
and be punished for something
that you have done?

541
00:34:05,793 --> 00:34:06,794
Where is Ji-hu now?

542
00:34:06,878 --> 00:34:09,005
I am planning on bringing her
when both of you leave.

543
00:34:09,422 --> 00:34:10,590
You are being unfair.

544
00:34:10,673 --> 00:34:12,175
I am being unfair? What about you?

545
00:34:13,009 --> 00:34:16,596
This is terrible. This is not
the coexistence that I wanted.

546
00:34:17,305 --> 00:34:20,892
The divorce documents are registered.
The court will send them to you soon.

547
00:34:21,642 --> 00:34:22,852
Prepare your answer form.

548
00:34:23,853 --> 00:34:26,939
You should hire a lawyer, too.
Don't you think?

549
00:34:36,115 --> 00:34:37,241
Come to the room.

550
00:34:43,498 --> 00:34:45,666
What is going on?

551
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:47,960
I am the one who's having
the hardest time here.

552
00:34:48,294 --> 00:34:50,004
-I can't live like this.
-Me, too.

553
00:34:50,505 --> 00:34:51,631
So, what's your plan?

554
00:34:51,964 --> 00:34:53,800
-Let's move to that house.
-Which one?

555
00:34:54,175 --> 00:34:56,761
My home. The one where I used to live in.

556
00:34:57,345 --> 00:34:59,639
Why me? Why should I live there
if I have this place?

557
00:34:59,722 --> 00:35:01,516
-Then what should I do?
-Just divorce her.

558
00:35:02,058 --> 00:35:05,603
Split your assets and make her leave.

559
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:07,063
Just give her the money.

560
00:35:07,188 --> 00:35:09,774
Divorce? I can't. I will not divorce her.

561
00:35:09,941 --> 00:35:12,944
I can't abandon my wife and my child
in any circumstances.

562
00:35:14,987 --> 00:35:17,240
What about me? What do you
expect me to do?

563
00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:19,200
I can't abandon you either.

564
00:35:20,118 --> 00:35:22,078
You greedy jerk.

565
00:35:22,453 --> 00:35:24,413
You greedy...

566
00:35:34,090 --> 00:35:35,883
Why did you come?

567
00:35:37,176 --> 00:35:38,177
Are you all right?

568
00:35:39,387 --> 00:35:40,346
Gosh.

569
00:35:40,513 --> 00:35:43,474
I can't bend my waist
because it's twisted.

570
00:35:44,725 --> 00:35:46,102
It'll get better.

571
00:35:46,936 --> 00:35:49,272
I heard that you talked to
the head of the factory

572
00:35:49,897 --> 00:35:51,941
and started the production lines,
in the midst of all this.

573
00:35:53,234 --> 00:35:54,610
I need to keep the company alive.

574
00:35:55,862 --> 00:35:59,282
I feel ashamed.
I failed to raise my kids properly.

575
00:36:00,867 --> 00:36:03,035
-Honey.
-Yes?

576
00:36:03,744 --> 00:36:06,664
Life doesn't always go as planned.

577
00:36:09,125 --> 00:36:11,210
"Grass, grass, golden grass.

578
00:36:11,961 --> 00:36:14,505
There's a fire deep in the mountains.

579
00:36:15,131 --> 00:36:17,592
It's the golden grass near one's grave.

580
00:36:18,593 --> 00:36:21,804
Spring has come,
the light of spring has come."

581
00:36:25,308 --> 00:36:28,978
You are greater than anyone.

582
00:36:29,896 --> 00:36:32,440
You're a person who memorized poems

583
00:36:32,523 --> 00:36:34,317
by peeking into your friend's
high school books.

584
00:36:35,151 --> 00:36:37,987
No one can do that except you.

585
00:36:41,073 --> 00:36:44,744
You have lived a good life so far.

586
00:36:46,662 --> 00:36:47,580
Thank you.

587
00:36:48,456 --> 00:36:51,250
I am happy at the end of my life
because of you.

588
00:36:53,461 --> 00:36:54,962
If your waist heals,

589
00:36:55,671 --> 00:36:58,841
should we go on a cruise trip?

590
00:37:01,594 --> 00:37:04,055
We should keep the company alive.

591
00:37:04,138 --> 00:37:05,932
You worked hard for it.

592
00:37:06,557 --> 00:37:09,685
Okay, then. Do as you wish.

593
00:37:10,061 --> 00:37:13,522
But, did your second son move out?

594
00:37:13,773 --> 00:37:16,734
Don't even mention him.
That crazy bastard.

595
00:37:18,569 --> 00:37:21,447
I will go and meet A-jin again.

596
00:37:31,290 --> 00:37:32,208
Hey.

597
00:37:32,917 --> 00:37:33,751
What?

598
00:37:34,085 --> 00:37:36,087
What did Bok-ja Park do before?

599
00:37:37,463 --> 00:37:40,549
-What?
-She has a criminal record of fraud...

600
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:43,177
There must be something more.

601
00:37:44,971 --> 00:37:46,013
What is it?

602
00:37:47,306 --> 00:37:48,849
How could I know?

603
00:37:49,058 --> 00:37:50,434
Use your head.

604
00:37:51,811 --> 00:37:54,272
If you keep dwelling near her,

605
00:37:54,730 --> 00:37:56,023
you'll get destroyed.

606
00:38:02,822 --> 00:38:04,407
I am a psychology professor.

607
00:38:06,742 --> 00:38:09,870
Looking through a person's mind
is my expertise.

608
00:38:12,707 --> 00:38:16,460
Do you think Bok-ja Park
will take care of you forever?

609
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:20,923
Certainly not.

610
00:38:22,216 --> 00:38:26,095
She will use you and abandon you.

611
00:38:30,266 --> 00:38:31,684
Mark my words.

612
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:53,497
One day at the sound of the leaves falling

613
00:38:53,831 --> 00:38:55,458
Let's all have a good day today!

614
00:38:55,708 --> 00:38:56,959
-Let's do it!
-Let's do it!

615
00:38:57,043 --> 00:39:00,504
I saw my empty heart

616
00:39:03,299 --> 00:39:07,970
I felt the time

617
00:39:09,847 --> 00:39:14,977
Had passed by meaninglessly

618
00:39:15,061 --> 00:39:16,020
Be quiet!

619
00:39:16,812 --> 00:39:17,772
Shut up!

620
00:39:22,568 --> 00:39:28,240
I lived like an idiot

621
00:39:29,116 --> 00:39:32,745
I

622
00:39:35,706 --> 00:39:40,920
I lived like an idiot

623
00:39:41,504 --> 00:39:45,925
Like an idiot like an idiot

624
00:39:46,425 --> 00:39:51,430
I lived like an idiot

625
00:39:51,514 --> 00:39:52,681
Oh God!

626
00:39:53,057 --> 00:39:56,435
This is not the coexistence I wanted.

627
00:39:57,103 --> 00:39:59,855
Why are you giving me

628
00:39:59,939 --> 00:40:02,358
such agony?

629
00:40:02,441 --> 00:40:03,818
...like an idiot

630
00:40:03,901 --> 00:40:05,152
Like an idiot

631
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:06,445
Like an idiot

632
00:40:06,529 --> 00:40:09,365
Like an idiot

633
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:15,663
I should be all right.

634
00:40:21,710 --> 00:40:23,170
Hello, Sir.

635
00:40:24,255 --> 00:40:25,631
It's me, Ji-yeong Park.

636
00:40:26,757 --> 00:40:28,426
Not at all.

637
00:40:28,759 --> 00:40:30,553
I am going to work right away.

638
00:40:32,388 --> 00:40:33,556
Yes.

639
00:40:35,015 --> 00:40:36,392
When shall we meet?

640
00:40:41,397 --> 00:40:42,606
Did you call me, sir?

641
00:40:42,982 --> 00:40:43,858
Sit.

642
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:50,197
I need you to secretly follow someone.

643
00:40:51,198 --> 00:40:52,116
Follow?

644
00:40:54,785 --> 00:40:56,036
Do you mean your wife?

645
00:40:57,163 --> 00:40:59,081
-No.
-Then who?

646
00:41:08,799 --> 00:41:10,634
Why did you want to see me?

647
00:41:10,968 --> 00:41:12,887
Order something. I have ordered already.

648
00:41:14,763 --> 00:41:15,973
One cup of Americano, please.

649
00:41:16,182 --> 00:41:17,975
Order something else. You're pregnant.

650
00:41:18,809 --> 00:41:20,978
A coffee while pregnant won't do any harm.

651
00:41:22,438 --> 00:41:25,399
I thought there would be no reason
to see you again.

652
00:41:27,193 --> 00:41:28,319
Who's the father?

653
00:41:30,446 --> 00:41:33,282
Why do I have to tell you?

654
00:41:33,365 --> 00:41:34,909
Because I think it concerns me.

655
00:41:35,242 --> 00:41:37,411
No, it doesn't.

656
00:41:37,578 --> 00:41:40,789
You're saying that
it's not my husband's child, right?

657
00:41:42,708 --> 00:41:46,670
Even if it is, it's my baby.
So mind your own business.

658
00:42:09,985 --> 00:42:11,153
Honey.

659
00:42:21,247 --> 00:42:22,998
-Hyo-ju.
-Hey.

660
00:42:23,624 --> 00:42:26,126
What brings you here?

661
00:42:27,086 --> 00:42:28,504
Who is she, honey?

662
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:32,466
She's someone I know.

663
00:42:34,009 --> 00:42:35,052
Hello.

664
00:42:37,763 --> 00:42:39,348
-Let's go.
-Oh, okay.

665
00:42:41,517 --> 00:42:43,644
Hyo-ju, I'm leaving.

666
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:55,614
My husband knows that I am pregnant.

667
00:42:56,865 --> 00:42:59,159
You texted him, right?

668
00:43:00,452 --> 00:43:01,745
Why did you do such a thing?

669
00:43:02,204 --> 00:43:04,873
What if he harms

670
00:43:05,791 --> 00:43:07,626
Dr. Jang out of anger?

671
00:43:07,710 --> 00:43:09,044
Have you considered an abortion?

672
00:43:10,212 --> 00:43:12,715
I can't believe you're saying
that after having

673
00:43:13,882 --> 00:43:15,676
-two children of your own.
-I have a feeling

674
00:43:16,427 --> 00:43:17,553
that my husband's the father.

675
00:43:17,636 --> 00:43:18,929
I'm going to raise him.

676
00:43:19,513 --> 00:43:21,890
So mind your own business.

677
00:43:21,974 --> 00:43:24,101
Why did you do that?

678
00:43:26,979 --> 00:43:28,272
How can you live like that?

679
00:43:32,067 --> 00:43:33,110
I was so

680
00:43:34,403 --> 00:43:35,237
lonely.

681
00:43:36,739 --> 00:43:37,698
Just

682
00:43:38,782 --> 00:43:40,993
so lonely.

683
00:43:52,212 --> 00:43:54,798
I heard that DNA tests
can't be done during pregnancy.

684
00:43:56,383 --> 00:43:58,552
Let's do the test after the baby is born.

685
00:43:59,261 --> 00:44:02,097
If my husband's the father,

686
00:44:03,349 --> 00:44:04,391
I'll raise the baby.

687
00:44:06,101 --> 00:44:07,645
-What?
-I will

688
00:44:09,188 --> 00:44:11,065
-raise him.
-You are out of your mind.

689
00:44:11,190 --> 00:44:14,693
So, don't divorce your own husband.

690
00:44:15,819 --> 00:44:17,780
-Why?
-If you do,

691
00:44:18,656 --> 00:44:20,366
my husband might want you.

692
00:44:23,952 --> 00:44:27,247
You don't know your own husband.

693
00:44:27,748 --> 00:44:31,210
Your husband is not the romantic type.

694
00:44:32,169 --> 00:44:34,338
He might want me? You must be joking.

695
00:44:35,089 --> 00:44:37,257
You think too highly of your husband.

696
00:44:38,175 --> 00:44:41,929
Why did you text my husband then?
What did you expect?

697
00:44:42,888 --> 00:44:45,974
I thought you don't want us
to get divorced.

698
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:46,975
I just wanted

699
00:44:47,893 --> 00:44:50,312
to give your family a hard time.

700
00:44:51,230 --> 00:44:52,815
Why should I be the only one to suffer?

701
00:44:52,898 --> 00:44:56,193
What makes you think that
I'm not suffering?

702
00:44:59,029 --> 00:45:00,948
I am having the hardest time among all.

703
00:45:03,534 --> 00:45:05,452
Both of us cheated,

704
00:45:06,537 --> 00:45:09,456
but why am I the only one
carrying the burden?

705
00:45:10,624 --> 00:45:13,001
It's terribly unfair.

706
00:45:14,711 --> 00:45:15,712
Okay,

707
00:45:17,631 --> 00:45:18,799
I know what I did was wrong.

708
00:45:20,134 --> 00:45:21,802
I had an affair with your husband.

709
00:45:23,011 --> 00:45:23,929
But

710
00:45:25,305 --> 00:45:28,684
I don't love him.

711
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:32,688
So, don't worry.

712
00:45:39,528 --> 00:45:41,113
Why did this happen?

713
00:45:42,531 --> 00:45:45,409
Why must it be my husband? Why?

714
00:45:51,832 --> 00:45:53,584
Bok-ja Park is not going to settle.

715
00:45:54,293 --> 00:45:56,920
The court is going to
issue an arrest warrant.

716
00:46:21,069 --> 00:46:21,904
It's me.

717
00:46:23,197 --> 00:46:24,448
Let's meet today.

718
00:46:26,658 --> 00:46:28,577
I was going to call you.

719
00:46:30,746 --> 00:46:32,539
Okay. See you there.

720
00:46:41,507 --> 00:46:43,342
Tell Jae-seok Ahn to come to my office.

721
00:46:43,550 --> 00:46:45,219
He's not here yet.

722
00:46:46,011 --> 00:46:47,054
What?

723
00:47:01,985 --> 00:47:03,111
-A-jin!
-Hey.

724
00:47:03,904 --> 00:47:06,949
You must be busy since it's the
recruiting season for foreign airlines.

725
00:47:07,324 --> 00:47:09,326
Yes. I have a lot going on.

726
00:47:10,536 --> 00:47:12,079
-Jeong-hui.
-Yes?

727
00:47:12,454 --> 00:47:15,207
I want to lecture. You told me
that you needed help.

728
00:47:15,707 --> 00:47:17,292
-Lecture?
-Yes.

729
00:47:20,337 --> 00:47:21,880
Why? No?

730
00:47:23,674 --> 00:47:26,510
The requirements for becoming a stewardess

731
00:47:26,593 --> 00:47:28,095
has become stricter.

732
00:47:28,387 --> 00:47:29,972
A higher English exam score
is needed, too.

733
00:47:30,055 --> 00:47:32,474
English isn't taught by people
with a stewardess background, right?

734
00:47:33,767 --> 00:47:36,311
You haven't been on an airplane
for more than ten years.

735
00:47:36,395 --> 00:47:38,772
A long time has passed since then.

736
00:47:39,106 --> 00:47:42,609
People want lectures from a person with a
fresh experience, not from an old person.

737
00:47:43,151 --> 00:47:44,945
All the airplanes have been renewed.

738
00:47:45,362 --> 00:47:47,406
The size of the overhead bins
are different now.

739
00:47:48,699 --> 00:47:50,659
Old person? Hey!

740
00:47:51,868 --> 00:47:52,744
Yes?

741
00:47:54,246 --> 00:47:57,416
You can reject me because of
my discontinued experience,

742
00:47:57,958 --> 00:48:00,836
but calling me an old woman
is unacceptable!

743
00:48:01,211 --> 00:48:02,921
That's not what I meant.

744
00:48:03,005 --> 00:48:04,715
This is what you should've said,

745
00:48:05,382 --> 00:48:08,051
"There are too many lecturers
with experience,

746
00:48:08,135 --> 00:48:11,305
I'm afraid that your chances may be slim."

747
00:48:13,974 --> 00:48:16,643
You are the head of a stewardess school,

748
00:48:18,353 --> 00:48:20,522
but how come your shoes are so pointy?

749
00:48:21,565 --> 00:48:23,609
Ok, fine. But keep in mind

750
00:48:23,942 --> 00:48:26,111
that I teach much better than you.

751
00:48:26,695 --> 00:48:29,531
Don't you know that I was famous for not
receiving any complaints as a stewardess?

752
00:48:30,032 --> 00:48:31,366
Of course, I do.

753
00:48:31,450 --> 00:48:32,492
Goodbye.

754
00:48:39,708 --> 00:48:42,669
I just got rejected. I can't believe it.

755
00:48:44,004 --> 00:48:45,339
It doesn't feel good.

756
00:48:51,928 --> 00:48:54,848
Where did you buy those sunglasses?
They look so pretty.

757
00:49:20,624 --> 00:49:22,918
Abandoning the title of
the daughter-in-law of Daesung Pulp...

758
00:49:23,585 --> 00:49:24,795
Don't you have regrets about that?

759
00:49:25,045 --> 00:49:26,880
No, I don't.

760
00:49:30,467 --> 00:49:32,427
Jae-seok Ahn didn't come to work today.

761
00:49:34,471 --> 00:49:36,264
Please take good care of Daesung Pulp
for me.

762
00:49:36,556 --> 00:49:39,309
I put in a lot of effort

763
00:49:39,393 --> 00:49:41,061
into the company,

764
00:49:42,396 --> 00:49:44,648
so I think I deserve to say that.

765
00:49:46,024 --> 00:49:47,526
Are you really going through the divorce?

766
00:49:48,068 --> 00:49:48,985
Yes.

767
00:49:51,196 --> 00:49:54,282
Even if you do, will you help the company?

768
00:49:55,117 --> 00:49:58,620
No. I will find my own way.

769
00:49:59,621 --> 00:50:02,374
I put in a lot of thought
into this decision.

770
00:50:04,292 --> 00:50:07,754
I'm not a type of person
who changes her mind.

771
00:50:10,590 --> 00:50:12,843
That's why I wanted to see you.

772
00:50:13,927 --> 00:50:16,430
Let's help each other.

773
00:50:16,888 --> 00:50:19,349
We can't help each other.

774
00:50:21,518 --> 00:50:25,021
I don't seek what's not mine.

775
00:50:33,864 --> 00:50:34,865
Very well.

776
00:50:36,241 --> 00:50:39,077
I wish you good luck.

777
00:50:39,661 --> 00:50:43,081
I wish you would find your own true life,

778
00:50:43,457 --> 00:50:45,041
and not harm anyone.

779
00:51:00,807 --> 00:51:02,267
Get out of the company!

780
00:51:02,726 --> 00:51:04,978
-Father!
-Don't make me say this again. Get out!

781
00:51:05,353 --> 00:51:06,188
This is unfair!

782
00:51:06,271 --> 00:51:08,857
How can you manage a company
if you can't even manage your own family?

783
00:51:09,316 --> 00:51:12,068
I didn't get enough sleep and I went
cycling early in the morning.

784
00:51:12,152 --> 00:51:14,571
I was tired, so I didn't go to work.

785
00:51:14,738 --> 00:51:16,615
You can't skip work because you're tired.

786
00:51:17,449 --> 00:51:19,701
You must be out of your mind!
Crazy bastard.

787
00:51:19,910 --> 00:51:21,244
I will work hard from tomorrow.

788
00:51:21,328 --> 00:51:22,537
Enough! Get out.

789
00:51:23,079 --> 00:51:26,583
I will think about it, if you
end your relationship with that woman.

790
00:51:27,751 --> 00:51:30,754
-I'm going home.
-Who's living in that home of yours?

791
00:51:31,254 --> 00:51:34,633
Who's your legal co-resident
and who's your roommate?

792
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:35,967
You son of a bitch.

793
00:51:40,180 --> 00:51:41,306
Who could it be?

794
00:51:44,559 --> 00:51:45,769
A-jin, you're here.

795
00:51:49,481 --> 00:51:51,024
Let's go inside. Is Ji-hu home?

796
00:51:51,358 --> 00:51:53,819
No. She has violin lessons.

797
00:51:54,110 --> 00:51:55,278
She should be home now.

798
00:51:56,238 --> 00:51:59,241
This is not Gangnam.
It takes time to get here.

799
00:52:00,575 --> 00:52:02,369
-Oh yes.
-You must be hungry.

800
00:52:03,119 --> 00:52:04,579
Do you want some kimchi wraps?

801
00:52:06,164 --> 00:52:07,123
Mom.

802
00:52:09,709 --> 00:52:10,585
Why?

803
00:52:11,795 --> 00:52:13,338
I need to live well,

804
00:52:15,215 --> 00:52:16,299
but

805
00:52:18,093 --> 00:52:19,719
things aren't going so well.

806
00:52:22,472 --> 00:52:23,390
Girl.

807
00:52:24,975 --> 00:52:28,228
If you did something wrong,
I could show you a lesson.

808
00:52:29,229 --> 00:52:32,691
But you didn't do anything wrong.
What can I possibly do to help?

809
00:52:35,777 --> 00:52:36,945
Sorry, mom.

810
00:52:40,740 --> 00:52:42,242
Life is like that.

811
00:52:43,743 --> 00:52:46,413
Life doesn't always go as planned.

812
00:52:50,083 --> 00:52:53,086
It really doesn't.

813
00:52:58,133 --> 00:53:00,135
My daughter. Cheer up!

814
00:53:04,222 --> 00:53:05,348
Okay.

815
00:53:10,353 --> 00:53:11,271
Mom!

816
00:53:15,275 --> 00:53:18,069
My princess! Did you have
a good violin lesson?

817
00:53:18,653 --> 00:53:19,529
Yes.

818
00:53:21,531 --> 00:53:22,449
Ji-hu.

819
00:53:23,074 --> 00:53:26,077
You don't need to participate
in the contest, if you don't want to.

820
00:53:27,579 --> 00:53:29,414
Mom. Did you cry?

821
00:53:30,582 --> 00:53:31,625
Sorry.

822
00:53:32,667 --> 00:53:36,379
I cried while I was talking to grandma.

823
00:53:37,797 --> 00:53:38,673
But

824
00:53:40,133 --> 00:53:41,509
these are not tears of sadness.

825
00:53:43,011 --> 00:53:44,012
Really.

826
00:53:46,723 --> 00:53:47,682
Mom,

827
00:53:49,100 --> 00:53:50,477
you can cry.

828
00:53:51,186 --> 00:53:52,520
Just because you're an adult,

829
00:53:53,313 --> 00:53:56,066
you don't need to be strong
in front of me.

830
00:53:57,108 --> 00:53:58,401
Just cry...

831
00:53:59,778 --> 00:54:02,280
Just cry when you want to.

832
00:54:02,614 --> 00:54:05,200
It's okay, mom.

833
00:54:17,379 --> 00:54:18,213
Mom.

834
00:54:19,464 --> 00:54:21,091
-Yes?
-You have me.

835
00:54:22,467 --> 00:54:25,887
You have me next to you.

836
00:54:27,847 --> 00:54:30,558
Yes, I know.

837
00:54:35,814 --> 00:54:36,898
Oh, my baby.

838
00:54:38,274 --> 00:54:40,151
Oh, my baby.

839
00:54:47,951 --> 00:54:49,160
You won't settle?

840
00:54:50,161 --> 00:54:53,081
Mr. Chairman told me not to, saying that
he needs to be taught a lesson.

841
00:54:54,082 --> 00:54:57,544
Then, is it okay for me
to give this tape to my father-in-law?

842
00:54:58,128 --> 00:54:59,671
Help yourself.

843
00:55:01,381 --> 00:55:04,342
How can you prove
that you didn't pay him for that tape?

844
00:55:06,553 --> 00:55:08,555
After all, you paid him 100 million won
to hit someone.

845
00:55:09,389 --> 00:55:13,351
It would be easy to pay him
extra for a tape.

846
00:55:15,729 --> 00:55:19,357
You are the true devil.

847
00:55:20,650 --> 00:55:23,945
You are no match for me,

848
00:55:24,404 --> 00:55:26,614
so you shouldn't have started.

849
00:55:28,450 --> 00:55:30,410
Let's see who wins.

850
00:55:32,078 --> 00:55:33,413
Sure.

851
00:55:34,372 --> 00:55:37,625
Take care of your imprisoned
husband for now.

852
00:55:38,460 --> 00:55:40,336
You're wasting my time by coming here.

853
00:56:01,316 --> 00:56:03,777
Your wife met this woman today.

854
00:56:05,236 --> 00:56:08,782
As you can see in the picture,
they cried and sobbed together.

855
00:56:09,115 --> 00:56:10,033
Strange, isn't it?

856
00:56:11,326 --> 00:56:14,454
Isn't she the mother of my son's friend?

857
00:56:14,746 --> 00:56:17,332
Yes. She's the wife of Dr. Jang,
the plastic surgeon.

858
00:56:20,835 --> 00:56:22,837
It doesn't seem like she's seeing a man.

859
00:56:23,755 --> 00:56:25,340
I'll have someone follow her.

860
00:56:29,094 --> 00:56:31,471
If I find out who the bastard is,

861
00:56:31,679 --> 00:56:33,431
I am going to kill him with my bare hands.

862
00:56:34,015 --> 00:56:36,267
Bong-sik. What's your plan?

863
00:56:43,316 --> 00:56:45,360
I guess you have no choice
but to divorce her.

864
00:56:45,777 --> 00:56:48,279
How can you live with a woman
with someone else's child?

865
00:56:53,118 --> 00:56:56,788
My son is really loyal to her.

866
00:56:58,540 --> 00:57:00,917
That's a problem.

867
00:57:31,698 --> 00:57:35,118
There's a man living in a red house

868
00:57:35,743 --> 00:57:38,580
I'm not alone

869
00:57:38,997 --> 00:57:42,375
There's a man living in a red house

870
00:57:53,803 --> 00:57:54,637
Hello?

871
00:57:59,267 --> 00:58:00,894
I'm coming to see you.

872
00:58:01,478 --> 00:58:02,562
See you soon.

873
00:58:16,743 --> 00:58:17,744
Are you a pervert?

874
00:58:19,579 --> 00:58:21,206
I want to protect our love.

875
00:58:49,067 --> 00:58:51,319
Then, what are your plans afterward?

876
00:58:51,402 --> 00:58:52,862
Don't ask me things like that anymore.

877
00:58:52,946 --> 00:58:55,615
Call me "Ma'am"
even when it's just the two of us.

878
00:58:56,074 --> 00:58:58,701
Help me. Let my husband out of jail.

879
00:58:58,910 --> 00:59:00,036
Why should I do that?

880
00:59:00,119 --> 00:59:01,913
Is there a reason not to?

881
00:59:02,288 --> 00:59:05,291
I want to meet you from time to time.

882
00:59:06,292 --> 00:59:07,544
Okay. Let's do that.

883
00:59:07,961 --> 00:59:09,462
-"Jae-seok Ahn"?
-I came all the way here

884
00:59:09,546 --> 00:59:12,215
to meet you because I heard
that you're a true lawyer

885
00:59:12,298 --> 00:59:13,258
who defends the powerless.

886
00:59:13,341 --> 00:59:15,885
Unbelievable. There are so many
lawyers in Seoul.

887
00:59:16,553 --> 00:59:18,304
Maybe he approached me intentionally.

888
00:59:18,680 --> 00:59:20,515
Hit and run.

889
00:59:20,848 --> 00:59:22,392
Daesung Pulp is perfect now.

890
00:59:22,600 --> 00:59:23,601
I will help you.

891
00:59:23,893 --> 00:59:27,021
Since the company is doing so well now,
you should sell it

892
00:59:27,272 --> 00:59:29,065
and keep the cash.

893
00:59:29,315 --> 00:59:30,775
Do you think I should sell the company?

894
00:59:31,192 --> 00:59:33,403
Do you want this? It's ruby.

895
00:59:33,528 --> 00:59:34,737
I think it will suit you.

896
00:59:34,821 --> 00:59:37,156
Thank you for calling me this afternoon.

897
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:38,408
You don't even need to thank me.

898
00:59:38,491 --> 00:59:41,160
Keep on being my puppet
and doing a good job at it.

899
00:59:41,244 --> 00:59:43,288
Don't be all confused and lame.

900
00:59:43,580 --> 00:59:45,290
That's how you can survive.

901
00:59:45,707 --> 00:59:48,835
We must not let her
go any further or have her way.

902
00:59:49,127 --> 00:59:50,378
Cripple her.

903
00:59:50,545 --> 00:59:53,965
I'm not the person I used to be.

904
00:59:54,382 --> 00:59:56,384
