1
00:00:43,585 --> 00:00:47,338
They were things that she wanted so badly.

2
00:00:48,798 --> 00:00:50,550
I wanted her to take all of them.

3
00:00:52,927 --> 00:00:54,429
The smell of burning leather

4
00:00:54,971 --> 00:00:56,639
was really revolting.

5
00:00:58,099 --> 00:01:02,020
It smelled as disgusting as rotting sludge
of human desires.

6
00:01:04,314 --> 00:01:05,231
Then,

7
00:01:06,775 --> 00:01:10,487
I burned my last gift for her.

8
00:01:40,558 --> 00:01:41,559
This is the police, right?

9
00:01:42,477 --> 00:01:43,770
I'm calling to report a theft case.

10
00:01:44,062 --> 00:01:45,355
What should we do now?

11
00:01:46,648 --> 00:01:48,650
We're totally screwed now.

12
00:01:51,528 --> 00:01:54,197
This situation is really driving me crazy.

13
00:01:54,572 --> 00:01:57,700
Why on earth did you do such a thing
without even talking to us about it?

14
00:01:58,034 --> 00:01:59,077
What are we going to do now?

15
00:02:00,453 --> 00:02:02,038
Dad's factory in China is not part of it.

16
00:02:02,163 --> 00:02:05,166
It's been sold too because it's
also considered the company's asset.

17
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:08,086
What about Dad's cash? He has cash.

18
00:02:08,169 --> 00:02:09,462
We can spend it.

19
00:02:09,546 --> 00:02:12,215
Hey, Jae-hui. How can you say that?

20
00:02:12,298 --> 00:02:13,967
What do you want me to do then?

21
00:02:14,175 --> 00:02:17,137
You should have stopped me when I said
we should get Dad's company back.

22
00:02:17,262 --> 00:02:19,097
We're in this mess
because you didn't stop me.

23
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:21,683
Are you kidding me right now?
You're the one who got us into this mess.

24
00:02:21,766 --> 00:02:23,476
I can't believe
you want to spend Dad's cash.

25
00:02:23,601 --> 00:02:25,103
What the hell is in that brain of yours?

26
00:02:25,186 --> 00:02:28,022
Look who's talking! Your wife divorced you
because you cheated on her.

27
00:02:28,106 --> 00:02:29,566
Don't be mean.

28
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:32,068
I'm being mean?
You idiot, you brought it upon yourself.

29
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:34,279
-You got what you deserved.
-What did you just say?

30
00:02:34,404 --> 00:02:37,282
-How dare you! If you weren't my sister...
-Fine, bring it on!

31
00:02:37,365 --> 00:02:39,826
-Go ahead and hit me. Just kill me.
-Please don't be like this.

32
00:02:39,909 --> 00:02:41,619
You should get through this together.

33
00:02:41,703 --> 00:02:44,622
You guys should just leave!

34
00:02:44,706 --> 00:02:45,748
We can't.

35
00:02:46,624 --> 00:02:48,376
We won't go anywhere until Jae-gu pays us.

36
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:52,422
I'm going crazy!
I'd much rather die than live like this.

37
00:02:52,797 --> 00:02:56,676
Why should you die? Sue that con man
and focus on getting the money back.

38
00:02:57,218 --> 00:02:59,637
Hey, do you know any lawyers?

39
00:02:59,762 --> 00:03:00,597
I do.

40
00:03:00,972 --> 00:03:02,307
He's a complete son of a bitch though.

41
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:05,894
Hey, you can't leave me here alone
with those two guys.

42
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:10,940
Gosh! Fuck my life.

43
00:03:14,277 --> 00:03:15,194
I...

44
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:18,406
need you to make me just like you.

45
00:03:20,658 --> 00:03:21,576
I...

46
00:03:23,995 --> 00:03:26,039
want you to make me just like you.

47
00:03:26,789 --> 00:03:30,251
A-jin Woo, make me just like you.

48
00:03:33,463 --> 00:03:34,297
Then...

49
00:03:36,591 --> 00:03:37,467
I'll...

50
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,386
help you save Mr. Chairman.

51
00:04:13,211 --> 00:04:14,754
You better not mess with me.

52
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:18,132
If you mess with me one more
time, I'll grind you up

53
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:21,344
and use you for salted
seafood with kimchi.

54
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:24,889
Did you send me hairtail heads?

55
00:04:25,974 --> 00:04:28,685
You must have lost your mind.

56
00:04:42,198 --> 00:04:43,491
Hello, Mr. Han. It's me.

57
00:04:44,826 --> 00:04:45,952
Let's meet.

58
00:05:38,421 --> 00:05:39,338
Ju-mi.

59
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:43,634
Ju-mi.

60
00:05:44,677 --> 00:05:45,553
Ju-mi!

61
00:05:50,266 --> 00:05:53,186
All my jewelry has been stolen.

62
00:05:53,311 --> 00:05:54,729
You called the police already, right?

63
00:05:56,981 --> 00:05:58,566
I really don't want to live anymore.

64
00:05:59,984 --> 00:06:02,153
By the way, where's Un-gyu?
It doesn't look like he's home.

65
00:06:02,236 --> 00:06:03,446
He's in the States.

66
00:06:03,738 --> 00:06:04,739
He's there with his friends

67
00:06:04,822 --> 00:06:06,908
to learn English
and celebrate his graduation.

68
00:06:06,991 --> 00:06:08,117
I'm glad he got to go away.

69
00:06:08,576 --> 00:06:10,912
He studied so hard
for the college entrance exam.

70
00:06:14,332 --> 00:06:16,959
Is there any word from Jae-gu?

71
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:18,628
I think

72
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:23,758
he's dead.

73
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:26,886
What are you talking about?

74
00:06:28,554 --> 00:06:30,515
I can't even figure out
when things started going wrong.

75
00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:37,730
I might go stay with my parents
for a few days.

76
00:06:39,524 --> 00:06:41,150
I don't want to be alone.

77
00:06:41,275 --> 00:06:44,195
Yes, you should. The school is closed
for a break now anyway.

78
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:46,364
I hope you can get
as much rest as possible.

79
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:58,668
I told you that you don't need
to come here anymore.

80
00:06:58,876 --> 00:07:01,587
Mr. Han would like me to stay
and continue helping you.

81
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:06,092
I bet he told you to continue
keeping a watchful eye on me.

82
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:16,394
I didn't think she would do that.
She even turned her phone off.

83
00:07:16,686 --> 00:07:18,062
People scare me the most.

84
00:07:18,354 --> 00:07:20,523
Do you happen to know
Ms. Jo's new address?

85
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:21,649
No, I don't.

86
00:07:23,818 --> 00:07:25,736
I do remember her talking
about where her son works

87
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:27,905
when we were chatting
at Pung-suk's Kitchen.

88
00:07:31,075 --> 00:07:33,119
-I love you.
-Oh, boy.

89
00:07:33,536 --> 00:07:34,996
-I love you.
-I love you.

90
00:07:35,329 --> 00:07:36,956
-I love you.
-I love you.

91
00:07:38,207 --> 00:07:39,876
-I love you.
-I love you.

92
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:50,511
I'll visit Mr. Chairman at the hospital.

93
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:53,347
-Okay, thank you.
-No problem.

94
00:07:54,724 --> 00:07:57,310
Thank you so much
for letting us meet at your place.

95
00:07:57,602 --> 00:07:58,936
How have you been, Ms. Baek?

96
00:07:59,228 --> 00:08:01,522
I moved north of the Han River.

97
00:08:02,773 --> 00:08:05,526
How about we have our next class
at Ms. Baek's place?

98
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:07,904
-It'll be like a housewarming party.
-Sounds good.

99
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:09,447
All right, let's do that.

100
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:13,451
"Let’s say that we had a good time.

101
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:16,704
The birds that have flown
over the bamboo forest

102
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:19,540
and the refreshing sound of the wind
that sparkles in our mind.

103
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:23,419
Like the fluffy splitting clouds
in the sky,

104
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:28,049
let’s say that we had a good time.

105
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:32,011
We were that beautiful,

106
00:08:32,553 --> 00:08:35,890
so sometime in the future,
we shall meet again

107
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:38,059
as little violet flowers."

108
00:08:40,144 --> 00:08:42,396
I recited Traveling Violet

109
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,357
by poet Tae-rim Kang for all of you

110
00:08:44,732 --> 00:08:46,984
because of today's topic.

111
00:08:47,401 --> 00:08:49,570
It's death.

112
00:08:49,987 --> 00:08:52,406
We all die one day.

113
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:56,410
In a way, knowing that we will die
might make us

114
00:08:57,078 --> 00:08:58,579
that much more eager for life.

115
00:08:59,413 --> 00:09:03,543
Today, I'd like all of us
to face the idea of death.

116
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:08,297
Let's think about how we'd feel
if we were to die tomorrow.

117
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:12,301
After choosing death as today's topic,

118
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:14,929
I texted all of you asking
to bring your will.

119
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:17,181
You all brought it, right?

120
00:09:17,265 --> 00:09:18,266
Yes.

121
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:21,978
-I love you.
-I love you.

122
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:25,398
OWNERSHIP TRANSFERRED
OWNER: JI-YEONG PARK

123
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:30,528
It includes
the subrogation certificate, right?

124
00:09:30,736 --> 00:09:32,321
It's with that certificate.

125
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:34,907
It looks like you want the house
under your name now.

126
00:09:35,074 --> 00:09:37,743
I'll leave it at this for now,

127
00:09:38,119 --> 00:09:40,121
but you'll have to see me in court.

128
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:41,622
Pardon me?

129
00:09:43,124 --> 00:09:45,418
Aren't you colluding with Mr. Min-gi Han?

130
00:09:46,544 --> 00:09:47,628
What are you talking about?

131
00:09:47,712 --> 00:09:50,339
I thought about suing right away,

132
00:09:51,507 --> 00:09:53,175
but I figured that
it'd be better to pay it off

133
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:56,304
and then, file a claim for all damages
that have been done.

134
00:09:56,637 --> 00:09:58,889
I'll also press charges
for fraud and embezzlement.

135
00:10:03,394 --> 00:10:06,147
Then, I'll see you in court.

136
00:10:15,698 --> 00:10:17,742
It's me, Mr. Han.

137
00:10:22,496 --> 00:10:25,666
-Hello?
-Hello, this is Gangnam Police Station.

138
00:10:38,346 --> 00:10:39,221
Excuse me.

139
00:10:40,348 --> 00:10:43,225
I'm here because I got a call
from Detective Chun-gi Lee.

140
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:44,894
-Are you Ms. Ji-yeong Park?
-Yes.

141
00:10:45,186 --> 00:10:47,396
Two cases have been reported to us.

142
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:50,316
The first one is Jae-gu Ahn going missing,

143
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:53,027
and the other one is
Bang-soon Cheon's theft case.

144
00:10:53,778 --> 00:10:56,530
You're connected to both cases.

145
00:10:57,448 --> 00:10:59,784
I know about Jae-gu going missing,

146
00:10:59,867 --> 00:11:03,162
but what do you mean
by Bang-soon Cheon's theft case?

147
00:11:03,245 --> 00:11:04,830
On February 13th,

148
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:07,375
she stole Ms. Ju-mi Park's
300 million won worth of jewelry

149
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:09,168
from Mr. Tae-dong Ahn's
residence and ran away.

150
00:11:10,461 --> 00:11:13,381
We heard that you hired her.

151
00:11:13,756 --> 00:11:15,257
-That's right.
-Where is she now?

152
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:16,258
Who?

153
00:11:17,551 --> 00:11:18,511
Bang-soon Cheon?

154
00:11:19,053 --> 00:11:21,097
Or were you asking about Jae-gu?

155
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:24,892
As for Jae-gu,

156
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:28,270
He broke into my hotel room with a knife.

157
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:30,689
You should be able to see it
in the security camera footage.

158
00:11:31,816 --> 00:11:33,567
We already checked the footage.

159
00:11:33,651 --> 00:11:35,694
Then, you must know who took him.

160
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:38,280
It was my bodyguard.

161
00:11:39,073 --> 00:11:42,993
But I'm afraid I have no idea

162
00:11:43,077 --> 00:11:44,370
what he did to him.

163
00:11:44,995 --> 00:11:47,832
Do you have no idea
what your bodyguard did?

164
00:11:47,915 --> 00:11:48,749
That's right.

165
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:51,585
Are you saying he did whatever he did

166
00:11:52,169 --> 00:11:53,337
at his sole discretion?

167
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:54,797
That's correct.

168
00:11:55,756 --> 00:12:00,970
I found him through the CEO of MK Capital,
Mr. Min-gi Han.

169
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:04,932
He probably did what Mr. Han

170
00:12:05,015 --> 00:12:06,475
told him to do.

171
00:12:14,358 --> 00:12:16,777
And as for Bang-soon Cheon,

172
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:18,195
I have no idea where she is now,

173
00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:21,490
but I can give you her address
in our hometown.

174
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:25,578
She's probably not there though.

175
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:34,170
By the way, did anyone file charges
against me for something else?

176
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:35,588
Like what?

177
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:40,092
I ran away with the money
from selling Chairman Ahn's company.

178
00:12:40,217 --> 00:12:44,221
That's why his eldest son
came to the hotel to kill me.

179
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:59,945
Gosh, it's a total shit show right now.

180
00:13:02,031 --> 00:13:04,200
The family is in such a mess
at the moment.

181
00:13:05,034 --> 00:13:08,537
There are so many things
that I have to sort out,

182
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:12,249
but you're keeping me here.
I don't have time to waste like this!

183
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:13,584
All right.

184
00:13:14,168 --> 00:13:16,086
Then, we should get started right away.

185
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:17,755
Name.

186
00:13:18,422 --> 00:13:19,924
That was

187
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:21,842
the first and last time I saw Ms. Park.

188
00:13:27,348 --> 00:13:30,893
This case is so perplexing
and complicated that it's...

189
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:33,562
By the way,

190
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:38,442
how did the two of you become close?

191
00:13:40,402 --> 00:13:42,988
"I'm departing this life like this,

192
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:45,199
but I want to leave
with a big smile on my face.

193
00:13:46,408 --> 00:13:48,369
Since the day I first met you,

194
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:51,455
every day of my life has been filled
with so much joy.

195
00:13:51,789 --> 00:13:55,709
I've never met anyone
with such a healthy way of thinking

196
00:13:56,794 --> 00:14:00,798
and I've also never seen anybody
with such a beautiful smile.

197
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:04,134
Hence, not being able to see you anymore
is the only reason

198
00:14:04,885 --> 00:14:07,680
why dying tomorrow

199
00:14:07,763 --> 00:14:09,014
is painful to me.

200
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:13,644
Let's meet a bit sooner in our next life

201
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,188
so that we can love each other more

202
00:14:17,064 --> 00:14:18,857
and be happier."

203
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:26,031
What was that? It was more
like a love letter than a will.

204
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:28,993
No, it is my will.

205
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:30,494
I want to give this

206
00:14:31,328 --> 00:14:33,330
to my dear wife

207
00:14:33,914 --> 00:14:36,667
-when I die.
-My goodness.

208
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:38,335
Mr. Kang, you're so romantic.

209
00:14:38,419 --> 00:14:43,215
Damn, I only wrote complaints about
my wife. You're making me look so bad.

210
00:14:46,677 --> 00:14:47,845
-Goodness.
-Good job.

211
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:49,805
Why

212
00:14:51,015 --> 00:14:52,182
was my love

213
00:14:53,934 --> 00:14:56,103
so meaningless?

214
00:14:57,605 --> 00:15:00,024
Ms. Woo, it's your turn now.

215
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:07,740
"These days, I'm going through

216
00:15:08,949 --> 00:15:11,452
the most intense
and difficult time of my life,

217
00:15:12,286 --> 00:15:14,914
but it's helping me grow significantly
as a person at the same time.

218
00:15:16,373 --> 00:15:20,127
I'm grateful to have had the opportunity
to think about life and death

219
00:15:20,252 --> 00:15:22,004
at this point in time

220
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:26,258
because I think I really needed it.

221
00:15:28,969 --> 00:15:33,057
As of tomorrow,
I will no longer be part of this world.

222
00:15:57,706 --> 00:15:59,583
My bones and flesh will be gone.

223
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:03,671
Starting tomorrow,
I'll exist as a mere skeleton."

224
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:06,048
I'm sorry. I'm really late, aren't I?

225
00:16:07,841 --> 00:16:10,678
"We worried about possible misfortunes
when we were happy,

226
00:16:11,887 --> 00:16:13,931
and we hoped for happiness
when such misfortunes befell us.

227
00:16:14,556 --> 00:16:17,351
Most importantly,
we lived with ceaseless desires

228
00:16:17,518 --> 00:16:19,853
for things that we couldn't have.

229
00:16:22,272 --> 00:16:24,066
While looking down on others,

230
00:16:24,274 --> 00:16:26,777
we still had to worry
about what they may think of us.

231
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:29,446
We constantly compared ourselves
to others thinking

232
00:16:29,863 --> 00:16:32,408
that it may help us decide how happy
or unhappy we can say we are.

233
00:16:38,622 --> 00:16:42,209
Nonetheless, being alive
is bliss in and of itself.

234
00:16:42,292 --> 00:16:44,211
I'm realizing it
now that I'm faced with death.

235
00:16:46,046 --> 00:16:48,882
I was grateful for life itself.

236
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:52,428
What made me happy
was neither fancy clothes

237
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:54,680
nor expensive bags.

238
00:16:55,597 --> 00:16:58,684
I thank and love

239
00:16:59,601 --> 00:17:02,896
the life I've lived
and the people I've met

240
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:05,274
over the course of my life."

241
00:17:22,916 --> 00:17:23,751
Who is it?

242
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:28,464
Who...

243
00:17:31,258 --> 00:17:32,342
Hello, Ms. Kim.

244
00:17:36,263 --> 00:17:37,222
What are you doing here?

245
00:17:37,598 --> 00:17:41,143
I came to say goodbye.
This month is my last month here.

246
00:17:42,227 --> 00:17:43,103
Come in.

247
00:17:57,159 --> 00:17:58,619
Did you find a new job?

248
00:17:58,702 --> 00:18:01,163
Yes, it's a sales position
at a credit card company.

249
00:18:01,246 --> 00:18:03,499
You got a promotion and a raise.

250
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:05,292
Why are you quitting?

251
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:07,294
Mr. Seo has dirt on me,

252
00:18:08,003 --> 00:18:09,922
so I've had to do some things
that I do not want to do.

253
00:18:11,173 --> 00:18:12,341
Things that you don't want to do?

254
00:18:13,383 --> 00:18:15,177
I've tailed someone and...

255
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:19,807
Anyway, I can't expect
to be treated respectfully

256
00:18:20,224 --> 00:18:21,850
if I stay here.

257
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:24,103
That's why I've decided to quit.

258
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:28,732
I think I'm partially responsible

259
00:18:31,318 --> 00:18:32,694
for you being treated like that.

260
00:18:34,071 --> 00:18:35,531
-I'm sorry.
-No.

261
00:18:35,989 --> 00:18:37,616
I'm the one who started off
on the wrong foot.

262
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:39,076
I want to apologize.

263
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:40,911
And thank you.

264
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:44,706
Ms. Kim, I hope you stay healthy.

265
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:47,251
Mr. Kim.

266
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:51,630
Do you need money?

267
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:54,133
No, not at all.
That's not what this was about.

268
00:18:55,509 --> 00:18:57,469
I broke up with that guy.

269
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:00,347
Do you

270
00:19:01,431 --> 00:19:02,850
want to be my boyfriend?

271
00:19:07,938 --> 00:19:10,190
You can say no by all means.

272
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,402
I'll be fine
because I have no feelings for you.

273
00:19:13,944 --> 00:19:16,947
I won't be hurt.

274
00:19:19,533 --> 00:19:20,367
Well...

275
00:19:20,951 --> 00:19:22,578
Can I think about it?

276
00:19:24,538 --> 00:19:25,956
Sure, think about it.

277
00:19:27,499 --> 00:19:28,417
You should go.

278
00:19:29,376 --> 00:19:30,252
Goodbye.

279
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:46,810
Just eat first.

280
00:19:47,311 --> 00:19:49,938
After this, we can meet
with the lawyer and the police.

281
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:51,481
Let's meet that prick, Mr. Han too.

282
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:54,735
By the way, about Jae-gu.

283
00:19:55,402 --> 00:19:56,445
Where do you think he is?

284
00:19:57,321 --> 00:19:59,448
He has never fallen off
the face of the earth like this.

285
00:20:00,824 --> 00:20:03,410
I know. What is happening?

286
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:05,120
What if he got abducted?

287
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:07,915
Do you guys have any idea?

288
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:10,918
Of course, we do.
It's probably Bok-ja Park's doing.

289
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:13,003
Try to use your brain a little.

290
00:20:13,128 --> 00:20:16,798
Gosh, what the hell?
Know your place, will you?

291
00:20:17,007 --> 00:20:18,258
How dare you lecture me?

292
00:20:18,425 --> 00:20:20,802
What should we tell the police first?

293
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:25,849
Hey, why did you cook the noodles
for so long? They're all sodden.

294
00:20:25,974 --> 00:20:29,436
That's what I wanted to say.
Is this supposed to be like udon or what?

295
00:20:30,187 --> 00:20:33,190
-Don't eat it then.
-I never said I don't want to eat it.

296
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:38,278
-This situation is driving me nuts!
-Gosh, seriously.

297
00:21:03,595 --> 00:21:04,930
-See you in the next class.
-Take care.

298
00:21:05,013 --> 00:21:06,598
-Bye.
-See you soon.

299
00:21:08,016 --> 00:21:10,852
Call me if those ladies start meeting up
regularly again for brunch.

300
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:12,312
Of course, I definitely will.

301
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:17,818
Mr. Kang, aren't you leaving?

302
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:22,030
I have to speak with Ms. Woo
about something related to her lawsuit.

303
00:21:22,406 --> 00:21:23,407
I'll leave in a bit.

304
00:21:23,907 --> 00:21:25,450
I still have some legal matters
to deal with.

305
00:21:25,742 --> 00:21:27,202
All right. I'll get going then.

306
00:21:33,709 --> 00:21:36,128
You didn't eat any of the snacks earlier.
Shall I fix you a meal?

307
00:21:37,045 --> 00:21:38,088
Thank you very much.

308
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:40,424
Excuse me for a moment.

309
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:48,223
She totally startled me.

310
00:21:49,933 --> 00:21:51,435
She must have been holding it.

311
00:21:55,022 --> 00:21:56,189
Everything looks delicious.

312
00:21:58,525 --> 00:22:01,153
Come join us. You must be hungry.

313
00:22:01,278 --> 00:22:02,154
Let's eat together.

314
00:22:04,197 --> 00:22:05,073
No, thanks.

315
00:22:06,783 --> 00:22:08,785
This kimchi is so good.

316
00:22:16,835 --> 00:22:18,045
Just come sit here.

317
00:22:24,843 --> 00:22:26,428
Eat up, Ms. Seong-hui Yun.

318
00:22:31,391 --> 00:22:33,060
There's something
I've been wanting to ask you.

319
00:22:33,852 --> 00:22:34,770
What is it?

320
00:22:36,021 --> 00:22:38,440
Did you really love Jae-seok?

321
00:22:40,108 --> 00:22:41,193
I'd rather not answer that.

322
00:22:44,112 --> 00:22:46,823
I see. That's clever.
You don't want to answer the question.

323
00:22:49,868 --> 00:22:52,537
I'm moving out. I've decided to give up.

324
00:22:53,121 --> 00:22:55,707
Seriously? You should sue.

325
00:22:55,874 --> 00:22:57,292
That way, I can make money.

326
00:23:00,337 --> 00:23:02,089
-What's wrong?
-This is so delicious.

327
00:23:18,105 --> 00:23:20,857
This isn't like any other rice punch.
It tastes divine.

328
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:23,860
I'll pack some for you when you leave
so that you can drink it at home.

329
00:23:25,112 --> 00:23:26,905
What are you planning to do
about that woman?

330
00:23:27,781 --> 00:23:30,283
I must take all the money she has.

331
00:23:31,326 --> 00:23:33,245
Everything including the company
and her money.

332
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:36,957
I cannot let a woman like her
enter the upper class

333
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,500
without shedding a drop of blood.

334
00:23:38,667 --> 00:23:41,253
There's nothing I haven't done
to get to where I am now.

335
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:46,341
Listen, I came this far on my own
through my own efforts.

336
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:50,887
I couldn't stand her
even the moment I first saw her.

337
00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:54,724
Who does she think she is?

338
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:59,104
That woman dared to humiliate me.

339
00:24:00,397 --> 00:24:01,648
Several times, not even just once.

340
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:06,671
-Hello?
-I'm looking for a style consultant.

341
00:25:07,881 --> 00:25:10,967
Just like how you were
on the lookout for a caregiver,

342
00:25:11,468 --> 00:25:13,970
I'm looking for a consultant

343
00:25:14,054 --> 00:25:15,639
who can refine my style
so that I can really

344
00:25:16,723 --> 00:25:17,933
become a woman of the upper class.

345
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:20,435
All right, I'll do it for you.

346
00:25:21,436 --> 00:25:23,813
You must have a specific taste though.

347
00:25:25,106 --> 00:25:27,567
I mean, you can't just hire anybody.
Aren't I right?

348
00:25:30,695 --> 00:25:32,113
I'd like it to be someone

349
00:25:33,448 --> 00:25:36,660
who likes Matisse and Kandinsky.

350
00:25:38,203 --> 00:25:39,454
Come now.

351
00:25:39,913 --> 00:25:42,791
To the place where we met
for the very first time.

352
00:25:46,044 --> 00:25:47,754
That place probably doesn't exist

353
00:25:48,755 --> 00:25:50,924
in your memory.

354
00:25:51,967 --> 00:25:53,677
Just come to the place where you remember

355
00:25:54,469 --> 00:25:56,596
meeting me for the first time.

356
00:25:57,389 --> 00:25:58,473
I'll see you there.

357
00:26:40,223 --> 00:26:42,642
The Daesung Pulp family
has basically lost everything.

358
00:26:42,809 --> 00:26:46,021
Ms. Jo and the woman
whom Bok-ja Park hired

359
00:26:46,104 --> 00:26:49,941
ran away with all the jewelry
that was in the house.

360
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:53,320
I heard that Bok-ja Park came back though.

361
00:26:53,403 --> 00:26:56,823
My goodness.
By the way, where did Ms. Jo go?

362
00:26:57,032 --> 00:26:59,200
Her daughter is hospitalized now.

363
00:26:59,409 --> 00:27:01,995
-That's probably where she is.
-That's right.

364
00:27:02,454 --> 00:27:04,706
She said her daughter
has to get kidney dialysis.

365
00:27:04,998 --> 00:27:06,124
Which hospital was it?

366
00:27:06,374 --> 00:27:07,959
It's not in Seoul.

367
00:27:08,043 --> 00:27:09,461
ORDERER: BOK-JA PARK

368
00:27:10,295 --> 00:27:13,214
Keep your voice down.
Pung-suk might hear us.

369
00:27:27,395 --> 00:27:29,439
Do you really like Matisse?

370
00:27:29,606 --> 00:27:31,316
I'm pretty sure I told you that day.

371
00:27:32,359 --> 00:27:36,363
I like Manet more than Matisse.

372
00:27:38,114 --> 00:27:38,990
Right, you said that.

373
00:27:40,367 --> 00:27:42,243
Are you happier now that you're divorced?

374
00:27:43,995 --> 00:27:46,247
Are you happier now that you have money?

375
00:27:54,506 --> 00:27:55,882
Have you hired a lawyer yet?

376
00:27:56,216 --> 00:27:58,468
I told you that the family will sue you
to get the shares back.

377
00:27:58,718 --> 00:28:00,804
Bring it on.

378
00:28:01,763 --> 00:28:03,765
I'm no longer part of the family.

379
00:28:04,474 --> 00:28:06,559
Jae-seok and his siblings
will have to do it,

380
00:28:06,893 --> 00:28:09,646
but Jae-gu has gone missing.

381
00:28:11,231 --> 00:28:12,982
Yes, I know that.

382
00:28:13,191 --> 00:28:15,318
I bet you also know where he is.
Aren't I right?

383
00:28:15,443 --> 00:28:18,613
You won't believe me,
but I don't know about that.

384
00:28:19,239 --> 00:28:22,909
The police must be doing their best
to find him at the moment.

385
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:25,453
I told them who might be a prime suspect.

386
00:28:30,834 --> 00:28:32,085
Let's take your measurements first.

387
00:28:32,335 --> 00:28:33,169
All right.

388
00:28:40,051 --> 00:28:41,386
What's your shoe size?

389
00:28:41,886 --> 00:28:43,263
I wear 245mm.

390
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,478
You said that
you want to be like me, right?

391
00:28:51,771 --> 00:28:52,605
Yes, I did.

392
00:28:52,814 --> 00:28:55,984
Then, will you be able to do as I say?

393
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:02,991
Of course.

394
00:29:04,367 --> 00:29:05,285
All right, then.

395
00:29:08,288 --> 00:29:10,415
Help Father wake up.

396
00:29:12,041 --> 00:29:13,793
We have to keep the promises
we made to each other.

397
00:29:15,253 --> 00:29:18,590
My plan was to win her over
to my side through it.

398
00:29:18,673 --> 00:29:20,091
Can we start today?

399
00:29:22,552 --> 00:29:24,888
Sure. Let's start today.

400
00:29:31,311 --> 00:29:33,396
HEALING HANDS

401
00:29:37,776 --> 00:29:39,819
Being treated like a queen

402
00:29:41,654 --> 00:29:45,116
while looking over
the entire Gangnam area from here

403
00:29:46,701 --> 00:29:48,244
is quite nice.

404
00:29:48,745 --> 00:29:51,706
Like everything else,
it's nicer when you behold it

405
00:29:53,583 --> 00:29:55,543
from afar and from the outside.

406
00:29:58,338 --> 00:30:01,382
My goal was to turn everything
back to square one.

407
00:30:02,175 --> 00:30:03,885
That was the last thing I had to do

408
00:30:04,511 --> 00:30:07,472
as I was leaving that family

409
00:30:09,182 --> 00:30:11,559
because after all,
I was the one who let Bok-ja Park

410
00:30:12,811 --> 00:30:14,437
set foot in that house in the first place.

411
00:30:16,022 --> 00:30:18,608
Father, it's me.

412
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:27,742
She's at home now.

413
00:30:28,827 --> 00:30:31,871
Do you think she's back for good?

414
00:30:34,457 --> 00:30:35,792
I'll make her stay.

415
00:30:38,127 --> 00:30:40,547
She'll probably leave me

416
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:44,509
if I wake up, right?

417
00:30:49,889 --> 00:30:52,934
Do you want to get your money back?

418
00:30:55,311 --> 00:30:56,145
Or

419
00:30:57,522 --> 00:31:00,316
is it her heart that you want back?

420
00:31:41,566 --> 00:31:44,944
Will

421
00:31:51,242 --> 00:31:52,076
I want a divorce.

422
00:31:59,334 --> 00:32:00,752
Do you want to go to trial or what?

423
00:32:00,877 --> 00:32:03,379
Who's the guy?
Who is the father of that baby?

424
00:32:03,504 --> 00:32:06,382
Why do you care? What matters is that

425
00:32:06,674 --> 00:32:07,842
it's not yours.

426
00:32:09,302 --> 00:32:11,220
Get out of my house immediately.

427
00:32:11,471 --> 00:32:12,347
I want alimony.

428
00:32:13,222 --> 00:32:15,600
Give me my share of the assets.
Then, I'll leave.

429
00:32:17,143 --> 00:32:18,144
Have you gone insane?

430
00:32:18,978 --> 00:32:20,730
Alimony, my ass.

431
00:32:20,813 --> 00:32:22,607
I should get alimony from you.

432
00:32:22,732 --> 00:32:24,776
You cheated on me
and even got pregnant with that guy.

433
00:32:24,859 --> 00:32:27,737
Let's go to trial then.

434
00:32:28,446 --> 00:32:31,240
Between me, who cheated on you
and is carrying a baby from the affair

435
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:34,410
and you, who hit me 47 times
in total up to this point,

436
00:32:34,494 --> 00:32:37,830
each time with a two week recovery,
who is more at fault?

437
00:32:38,706 --> 00:32:40,249
Let's ask the judge.

438
00:32:40,708 --> 00:32:42,251
-You...
-Last but not least,

439
00:32:42,502 --> 00:32:44,170
we should ask Yun-jae too.

440
00:32:44,671 --> 00:32:46,673
He should get a say in deciding
with whom he wants to live

441
00:32:47,048 --> 00:32:48,591
between his two parents.

442
00:33:08,486 --> 00:33:10,863
LAW OFFICE OF GI-HO KANG
GI-HO KANG, ATTORNEY AT LAW

443
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:20,957
Hey, what are you doing here?

444
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:25,461
From what I remember,

445
00:33:25,545 --> 00:33:27,714
I've made it clear to you
that I don't want to represent you.

446
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:30,758
I have no interest in hiring
a lawyer like you. What is wrong with you?

447
00:33:30,842 --> 00:33:32,093
Why are you here then?

448
00:33:34,262 --> 00:33:36,055
To study the recent trends
in the legal industry.

449
00:33:40,810 --> 00:33:41,644
Gosh, that little...

450
00:33:41,728 --> 00:33:43,396
I can knock him out with a single punch.

451
00:33:51,988 --> 00:33:54,907
You must be well aware
of the situation your family is in.

452
00:33:55,867 --> 00:33:59,120
-What?
-Won't you sue Ms. Park for the shares?

453
00:33:59,203 --> 00:34:00,246
Why do you care?

454
00:34:00,329 --> 00:34:02,457
The situation is very serious,

455
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:04,751
yet your ex-wife is looking after
your father at the hospital

456
00:34:05,334 --> 00:34:08,004
and you're even making her
worry about your family's legal matters.

457
00:34:08,087 --> 00:34:11,007
What you just said is bothering me
on so many levels.

458
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:13,760
First off, why do you know so much
about my family's situation?

459
00:34:13,843 --> 00:34:17,096
That's exactly my point.
Why are you making me know so much?

460
00:34:17,430 --> 00:34:19,348
You should figure it out
so that I don't need to know.

461
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:21,726
Also, are you worrying

462
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:23,561
about my wife right now?

463
00:34:25,021 --> 00:34:25,855
Hey, look.

464
00:34:26,522 --> 00:34:29,817
If you call her your wife once again,
I'll teach you a serious lesson.

465
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:32,737
-She is my wife.
-You two are divorced now.

466
00:34:32,862 --> 00:34:35,948
-I'm going to file an appeal.
-Sure, go ahead. By all means.

467
00:34:36,616 --> 00:34:40,119
But please make sure Ms. Woo won't have
to worry about your family anymore.

468
00:34:40,286 --> 00:34:42,663
She looks exhausted these days
because she's been working so much.

469
00:34:46,876 --> 00:34:49,462
Why are you worried about my spouse
looking exhausted?

470
00:34:49,545 --> 00:34:50,922
I told you she's not your wife anymore.

471
00:34:51,005 --> 00:34:53,174
That's why I'm calling her my "spouse."

472
00:34:55,676 --> 00:34:56,594
Are you an idiot?

473
00:34:57,595 --> 00:34:59,180
You little piece of...

474
00:35:00,765 --> 00:35:03,601
Why is this so heavy? Gosh.

475
00:35:03,684 --> 00:35:05,228
Come out. Just leave.

476
00:35:12,193 --> 00:35:13,194
Goodness.

477
00:35:16,072 --> 00:35:18,116
Why did you put the trash can here?

478
00:35:21,828 --> 00:35:23,371
You'd never think he's not all there.

479
00:35:29,669 --> 00:35:31,587
I can't believe you're giving
all of those away.

480
00:35:32,171 --> 00:35:33,714
My most valuable asset is myself.

481
00:35:33,923 --> 00:35:35,591
I won't rely on clothes anymore.

482
00:36:00,116 --> 00:36:02,994
She's my client. It wasn't easy for her
to come here. Say hello.

483
00:36:08,374 --> 00:36:09,333
Hello.

484
00:36:10,418 --> 00:36:12,545
I'm almost done.
Please give me a few minutes.

485
00:36:12,753 --> 00:36:13,588
Okay.

486
00:36:47,830 --> 00:36:48,748
Oh god.

487
00:36:57,256 --> 00:36:58,716
Hey, you know what?

488
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:02,094
I just thought that monogamy
where infidelity is

489
00:37:02,178 --> 00:37:03,304
legally allowed...

490
00:37:03,387 --> 00:37:04,472
No, I mean...

491
00:37:05,014 --> 00:37:06,891
The society that allows love.

492
00:37:07,016 --> 00:37:10,478
I just dreamed of that idea, Mr. Park.

493
00:37:10,603 --> 00:37:13,147
You don't have time to be
sitting here like this, Mr. Ahn.

494
00:37:13,814 --> 00:37:15,399
What should I be doing then?

495
00:37:15,524 --> 00:37:17,818
The police are at the office
at the moment.

496
00:37:18,527 --> 00:37:20,863
-Why?
-They arrived

497
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:22,031
when you called me.

498
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:24,033
Why are they there?

499
00:37:24,408 --> 00:37:26,160
You should go there now and find out.

500
00:37:28,246 --> 00:37:29,789
Hurry up. Get in.

501
00:37:30,206 --> 00:37:31,082
Get in.

502
00:37:33,542 --> 00:37:34,377
Jae-hui.

503
00:37:36,379 --> 00:37:39,215
Stop right there! Gosh. Jae-hui!

504
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:44,887
Are you saying Jae-hui brought
those two guys

505
00:37:45,096 --> 00:37:46,681
and beat up Mr. Han?

506
00:37:46,764 --> 00:37:48,057
Yes, that's right.

507
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:49,725
Why on earth did she...

508
00:37:49,976 --> 00:37:52,520
By the way, that man, Mr. Han...

509
00:37:52,812 --> 00:37:54,021
What happened to him?

510
00:37:55,147 --> 00:37:55,982
Sorry?

511
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:59,151
You don't know anything.

512
00:37:59,902 --> 00:38:02,530
Gosh, this totally sobered me up.

513
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:07,451
Everyone in that family is an idiot.
All of them are too impulsive.

514
00:38:08,202 --> 00:38:09,412
So, what happened to Jae-gu Ahn?

515
00:38:10,913 --> 00:38:12,123
I did what you told me to do.

516
00:38:12,206 --> 00:38:14,792
Well, I guess they'll sort it out
amongst themselves now.

517
00:38:14,875 --> 00:38:15,960
It's none of my business.

518
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:19,422
By the way, did he believe all of that?

519
00:38:20,256 --> 00:38:22,008
Yes, he did.

520
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:24,677
I told you. All of them are brainless.

521
00:38:31,267 --> 00:38:34,395
I'd like to thank your housekeeper
for looking after Mr. Chairman.

522
00:38:34,603 --> 00:38:37,231
Please stay by his side
even for just a few hours at night.

523
00:38:37,732 --> 00:38:38,733
Okay, I will.

524
00:38:39,942 --> 00:38:41,277
I'll see you tomorrow at the gallery.

525
00:38:42,111 --> 00:38:42,987
All right.

526
00:38:44,697 --> 00:38:45,614
Wait.

527
00:38:49,869 --> 00:38:53,664
The last outfit you wore today,
the two-piece suit.

528
00:38:55,082 --> 00:38:56,625
Please make me

529
00:38:57,418 --> 00:38:58,627
the exact same one.

530
00:39:01,672 --> 00:39:02,506
Sure.

531
00:39:05,676 --> 00:39:06,552
You should get going now.

532
00:39:07,345 --> 00:39:08,846
Don't worry about Mr. Chairman.

533
00:39:09,638 --> 00:39:10,723
Ms. Park.

534
00:39:14,310 --> 00:39:16,771
You're not a bad person.

535
00:39:18,022 --> 00:39:19,857
I've known that from the get-go.

536
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:22,234
That's why

537
00:39:23,361 --> 00:39:25,780
you can never become happy
by committing bad deeds.

538
00:39:56,268 --> 00:39:57,686
I'm here now.

539
00:40:03,275 --> 00:40:04,860
So, please wake up soon.

540
00:40:31,345 --> 00:40:32,930
I'm so impressed by A-jin.

541
00:40:33,013 --> 00:40:34,682
She's giving these away
without any hesitation.

542
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:38,853
It's getting late.
You should leave for the day, Jin-hui.

543
00:40:38,936 --> 00:40:39,937
No, it's okay.

544
00:40:40,896 --> 00:40:42,398
Let's finish it up tomorrow.

545
00:40:43,524 --> 00:40:46,235
We just have a few more to upload.
Can I finish it before I leave today?

546
00:40:47,153 --> 00:40:51,157
My goodness. A-jin is blessed to have
such amazing people around her.

547
00:40:51,323 --> 00:40:53,492
Where did she even find
a sworn sister like you?

548
00:40:53,868 --> 00:40:55,744
Let's grab a snack together
after we finish this.

549
00:40:56,036 --> 00:40:57,121
Shall we?

550
00:40:57,997 --> 00:40:59,123
Count me in too.

551
00:40:59,665 --> 00:41:02,626
A-jin said she's coming back.
The four of us should grab a drink.

552
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:05,421
Detective, that guy is a con man.

553
00:41:05,629 --> 00:41:07,423
We didn't do anything wrong.

554
00:41:07,923 --> 00:41:10,885
Will you keep your mouth shut
like a total loser if you get conned?

555
00:41:10,968 --> 00:41:14,013
Listen. You barged into his office,

556
00:41:14,096 --> 00:41:15,723
threatened him and beat him up!

557
00:41:15,806 --> 00:41:16,891
Of course, I had to do it.

558
00:41:17,433 --> 00:41:20,186
I told you that my family lost everything
because of that jerk.

559
00:41:20,269 --> 00:41:22,813
So, what?
Is that why you paid these guys here

560
00:41:22,897 --> 00:41:24,732
and solicited them to assault him?

561
00:41:24,982 --> 00:41:26,400
What on earth are you talking about?

562
00:41:26,984 --> 00:41:28,402
I won't pay these guys.

563
00:41:29,153 --> 00:41:30,779
You promised us that you'll pay us.

564
00:41:30,863 --> 00:41:32,156
As you know, the plan failed.

565
00:41:32,364 --> 00:41:35,409
You and your brothers are all liars.
All of you are swindlers.

566
00:41:36,285 --> 00:41:37,119
Jae-hui.

567
00:41:37,995 --> 00:41:39,205
What brings you here?

568
00:41:39,622 --> 00:41:41,749
-Oh, hello.
-Hey.

569
00:41:42,208 --> 00:41:43,334
What took you so long?

570
00:41:43,876 --> 00:41:46,420
Apparently, Ju-mi has filed
a missing-person report for Jae-gu.

571
00:41:46,545 --> 00:41:48,464
-Did you know about it?
-How would I know?

572
00:41:48,839 --> 00:41:50,883
By the way, can you think or not?

573
00:41:51,175 --> 00:41:54,220
What on earth were you trying to do there
with these guys in broad daylight?

574
00:41:54,470 --> 00:41:57,181
Don't even tell anyone
that I'm your brother. You embarrass me.

575
00:41:57,264 --> 00:41:58,432
Look who's talking.

576
00:41:58,516 --> 00:41:59,642
Please lock up these people.

577
00:41:59,725 --> 00:42:02,061
We couldn't even hit him once.

578
00:42:03,270 --> 00:42:06,065
Where on earth did Jae-gu find
these useless idiots?

579
00:42:06,232 --> 00:42:07,900
Be quiet, please.

580
00:42:08,234 --> 00:42:10,611
Do you guys think that this place
is your living room or what?

581
00:42:15,658 --> 00:42:17,993
Aren't we getting beef bone soup?

582
00:42:19,662 --> 00:42:21,497
-Goodness.
-What a nutjob.

583
00:42:22,206 --> 00:42:24,083
SUSPECT: JAE-HUI AHN

584
00:42:30,214 --> 00:42:31,840
-See you.
-Bye.

585
00:42:33,884 --> 00:42:37,263
-Here's to A-jin's success!
-Cheers!

586
00:42:42,935 --> 00:42:44,270
I told him to join us.

587
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:46,146
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

588
00:43:06,417 --> 00:43:07,543
Bok-ja.

589
00:43:20,180 --> 00:43:21,473
Bok-ja.

590
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:27,855
Mr. Chairman.

591
00:43:30,608 --> 00:43:31,734
Thank you.

592
00:43:36,572 --> 00:43:37,489
Mr. Chairman.

593
00:43:43,495 --> 00:43:45,080
You've regained your consciousness?

594
00:43:55,174 --> 00:43:56,216
Mr. Chairman?

595
00:44:28,082 --> 00:44:31,794
You don't need to explain everything.

596
00:44:34,755 --> 00:44:35,589
I just

597
00:44:37,174 --> 00:44:39,259
wanted to know your true feelings for me.

598
00:44:43,347 --> 00:44:45,891
You can keep all the money.

599
00:44:47,226 --> 00:44:48,977
I don't need it.

600
00:44:53,315 --> 00:44:56,068
You don't need to run away that far

601
00:44:56,777 --> 00:44:58,946
because it's all yours anyway.

602
00:45:07,079 --> 00:45:09,373
I'm sorry.

603
00:45:14,002 --> 00:45:17,631
You're the one
who brought me back to consciousness.

604
00:45:18,215 --> 00:45:19,299
Thank you.

605
00:45:20,259 --> 00:45:21,927
That's enough for me.

606
00:45:34,022 --> 00:45:34,940
Mr. Chairman.

607
00:45:36,775 --> 00:45:39,528
Shall we go home now?

608
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:43,866
Please don't worry about anything

609
00:45:44,491 --> 00:45:45,742
and wake up soon

610
00:45:48,495 --> 00:45:49,329
so that

611
00:45:50,706 --> 00:45:52,499
we can go on cruises together.

612
00:45:54,501 --> 00:45:56,336
Let's live like that.

613
00:46:08,974 --> 00:46:10,517
What? That woman is back?

614
00:46:10,976 --> 00:46:12,227
Where is she now?

615
00:46:12,811 --> 00:46:14,605
I'll pull all of her hair out.

616
00:46:14,688 --> 00:46:16,607
You're being thoughtless again.

617
00:46:16,690 --> 00:46:17,524
I think

618
00:46:17,608 --> 00:46:20,068
we should discuss how we can divide
the assets and properties fairly.

619
00:46:20,152 --> 00:46:21,153
Of course.

620
00:46:21,862 --> 00:46:24,323
That woman better not have spent
all the money she took.

621
00:46:24,615 --> 00:46:26,241
You have no right to inherit anything.

622
00:46:26,992 --> 00:46:29,912
Didn't you take out a loan with this house
as a collateral and get conned?

623
00:46:30,204 --> 00:46:31,079
Well, that's...

624
00:46:31,163 --> 00:46:32,956
I was just trying to save the company.

625
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:35,042
What will you do
if Father finds out about it?

626
00:46:35,667 --> 00:46:37,127
How will Dad find out?

627
00:46:38,128 --> 00:46:39,630
He woke up.

628
00:46:42,174 --> 00:46:43,008
Sorry?

629
00:46:47,346 --> 00:46:48,597
Gosh, you startled me.

630
00:46:50,807 --> 00:46:52,100
Are you guys showing up just now?

631
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:53,977
You're one to talk.

632
00:46:54,061 --> 00:46:56,271
Hey, Jae-hui.

633
00:46:57,648 --> 00:46:58,524
Mr. Chairman...

634
00:46:58,607 --> 00:46:59,441
I mean,

635
00:47:00,484 --> 00:47:02,277
your father collapsed,

636
00:47:03,612 --> 00:47:04,947
yet you didn't even visit him once.

637
00:47:06,031 --> 00:47:07,449
I was going to visit him.

638
00:47:07,866 --> 00:47:10,077
-Because of the company's situation...
-Shut up.

639
00:47:10,702 --> 00:47:12,829
I want you gone from here

640
00:47:13,997 --> 00:47:16,375
as well as from the house immediately.

641
00:47:23,048 --> 00:47:26,343
Isn't this what you guys want?

642
00:47:28,220 --> 00:47:31,390
What did you guys do
when I ran away with the money?

643
00:47:32,015 --> 00:47:35,519
All of you were only after the money.

644
00:47:36,395 --> 00:47:37,896
Your father collapsed,

645
00:47:39,022 --> 00:47:40,065
but no one...

646
00:47:40,524 --> 00:47:42,234
None of you even worried about him.

647
00:47:42,401 --> 00:47:44,736
What are you talking about?
I came here to see him.

648
00:47:44,820 --> 00:47:48,198
Where is Jae-gu? Where on earth is he now?

649
00:47:52,327 --> 00:47:53,954
He tried to kill me.

650
00:47:56,206 --> 00:47:59,793
He broke into my hotel room with a knife.

651
00:48:02,879 --> 00:48:03,714
So?

652
00:48:05,382 --> 00:48:06,550
Where is he now?

653
00:48:07,134 --> 00:48:08,093
Do you want to know?

654
00:48:10,095 --> 00:48:11,972
You colluded with Bong-cheol Gu

655
00:48:12,264 --> 00:48:13,140
to take my money...

656
00:48:13,223 --> 00:48:14,182
I mean,

657
00:48:14,766 --> 00:48:15,726
this money.

658
00:48:17,519 --> 00:48:18,729
You lost your reason

659
00:48:19,646 --> 00:48:21,648
just to get your hands on this money.

660
00:48:22,983 --> 00:48:23,859
Do you...

661
00:48:25,819 --> 00:48:26,695
Do you know

662
00:48:27,863 --> 00:48:29,489
why I decided to come back?

663
00:48:31,450 --> 00:48:33,785
Because I didn't want to turn out
like you people.

664
00:48:33,869 --> 00:48:34,953
Shut your mouth.

665
00:48:37,122 --> 00:48:38,248
You're screwed now.

666
00:48:38,332 --> 00:48:39,708
I should be saying that to you.

667
00:48:41,501 --> 00:48:45,589
That house is mine now.

668
00:48:46,632 --> 00:48:48,592
And I want all of you

669
00:48:48,967 --> 00:48:50,344
gone from that house.

670
00:48:51,511 --> 00:48:52,346
I

671
00:48:53,388 --> 00:48:57,559
do not want to live with human trash
like you people in the same house.

672
00:48:58,560 --> 00:48:59,811
Who says that house is yours?

673
00:49:00,479 --> 00:49:02,898
You lost that house like a total idiot

674
00:49:03,899 --> 00:49:05,275
and I got it back.

675
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:07,819
How can you say that you got it back?
That's my dad's money.

676
00:49:07,903 --> 00:49:08,945
Right.

677
00:49:09,863 --> 00:49:11,823
I'm so glad you brought it up.

678
00:49:12,491 --> 00:49:13,325
Dad?

679
00:49:14,701 --> 00:49:16,912
You obviously knew
that your dad collapsed. Why...

680
00:49:17,663 --> 00:49:20,207
Why didn't you visit him
when he was unconscious?

681
00:49:24,836 --> 00:49:26,755
I can't give you guys much time.

682
00:49:28,465 --> 00:49:29,424
I want you guys

683
00:49:31,343 --> 00:49:34,137
gone from my house immediately.

684
00:49:51,697 --> 00:49:53,240
If I can be born again,

685
00:49:54,408 --> 00:49:55,909
I'll become a painter.

686
00:49:56,952 --> 00:49:58,954
You don't need to be born again
to do that.

687
00:50:01,289 --> 00:50:02,833
You should learn how to paint.

688
00:50:03,250 --> 00:50:05,127
You can become a painter in this lifetime.

689
00:50:06,795 --> 00:50:07,671
Do you think

690
00:50:08,630 --> 00:50:10,132
I can become a painter?

691
00:50:10,257 --> 00:50:12,676
Of course. It's more than possible.

692
00:50:13,593 --> 00:50:15,303
I'll introduce you to a painter.

693
00:50:16,012 --> 00:50:19,433
-Really?
-Art is a hobby of many upper-class women.

694
00:50:19,641 --> 00:50:21,393
They like to look at paintings
or paint themselves.

695
00:50:22,060 --> 00:50:23,937
Almost all of them do one of the two.

696
00:50:25,939 --> 00:50:27,399
I registered you for golf lessons.

697
00:50:27,691 --> 00:50:29,651
You have to learn it starting tomorrow.

698
00:50:32,070 --> 00:50:32,904
Okay.

699
00:50:46,209 --> 00:50:47,085
Hello, ma'am.

700
00:50:48,754 --> 00:50:50,756
When does Su-yeon Oh's exhibition start?

701
00:50:50,881 --> 00:50:53,300
You'll have to wait a little while, ma'am.

702
00:50:53,675 --> 00:50:55,719
It's scheduled to start
on the 8th of the next month,

703
00:50:55,802 --> 00:50:59,139
but I'll give you a call before that.

704
00:51:00,307 --> 00:51:01,808
-Thank you.
-Ma'am.

705
00:51:02,392 --> 00:51:04,227
Eastern-style paintings
are popular these days.

706
00:51:04,394 --> 00:51:06,772
May I introduce you
to a few talented artists?

707
00:51:08,899 --> 00:51:10,734
I wouldn't mind it,

708
00:51:11,943 --> 00:51:13,904
but I already chose Su-yeon Oh.

709
00:51:14,362 --> 00:51:16,031
Okay, I got it.

710
00:51:22,871 --> 00:51:23,997
What did you think?

711
00:51:24,956 --> 00:51:27,751
You were proactive and friendly.

712
00:51:27,918 --> 00:51:29,002
Whom did you observe?

713
00:51:29,628 --> 00:51:30,545
Well,

714
00:51:31,296 --> 00:51:32,589
I was obviously observing you.

715
00:51:32,672 --> 00:51:34,841
You shouldn't be observing me anymore.

716
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:39,095
I no longer belong to the upper class.

717
00:51:39,179 --> 00:51:41,014
I took a step down the ladder
at my own will.

718
00:51:41,431 --> 00:51:44,309
You should be studying that lady
with whom I was speaking.

719
00:51:46,019 --> 00:51:49,147
Her low voice and the look on her face
that makes you wonder

720
00:51:49,231 --> 00:51:51,233
whether she respects your opinion.

721
00:51:51,858 --> 00:51:54,611
She uses nouns more than verbs
in order to convey her messages,

722
00:51:54,861 --> 00:51:56,988
and she makes sure her short answers
always sound respectful.

723
00:51:57,572 --> 00:51:59,699
She also has a habit
of being brief and direct

724
00:51:59,825 --> 00:52:01,910
when she needs to express her opinion.

725
00:52:02,077 --> 00:52:02,911
Also,

726
00:52:03,829 --> 00:52:05,038
when you're talking to people,

727
00:52:05,372 --> 00:52:07,374
you must look at them in the eye.

728
00:52:13,171 --> 00:52:14,339
I was curious.

729
00:52:15,131 --> 00:52:17,592
Why did she change her mind?

730
00:52:18,426 --> 00:52:20,929
Why did she come back so easily?

731
00:52:21,763 --> 00:52:24,599
What changed her mind?

732
00:52:25,934 --> 00:52:27,394
When she came back,

733
00:52:28,395 --> 00:52:30,730
the whole world
was already suspicious of her.

734
00:52:31,940 --> 00:52:33,984
Everyone hated her.

735
00:52:35,986 --> 00:52:37,946
I bet she has an ulterior motive.

736
00:52:38,530 --> 00:52:40,240
Otherwise,
she wouldn't come back like this.

737
00:52:40,407 --> 00:52:41,992
Where on earth is Jae-gu?

738
00:52:42,242 --> 00:52:44,786
She'll go to the police station tomorrow
to give her statement.

739
00:52:45,537 --> 00:52:47,497
Then, Jae-gu will get arrested.

740
00:52:47,581 --> 00:52:49,875
We won't be able to find him
if she doesn't do that.

741
00:52:49,958 --> 00:52:52,085
The police can't investigate
without knowing what happened.

742
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:54,296
I think

743
00:52:55,130 --> 00:52:56,923
this house is under that woman's name now.

744
00:53:06,141 --> 00:53:10,020
Clean the house and look after your dad
until we find a housekeeper.

745
00:53:11,897 --> 00:53:12,772
Me?

746
00:53:13,607 --> 00:53:14,482
Don't you want to do it?

747
00:53:15,525 --> 00:53:18,236
Then, move out immediately.

748
00:53:25,660 --> 00:53:26,995
What will you do about those guys?

749
00:53:27,412 --> 00:53:30,498
Our debt has gone from 17 million won
to 25 million won.

750
00:53:30,624 --> 00:53:32,584
I never promised them any money.

751
00:53:33,043 --> 00:53:35,337
They offered to do it for free,

752
00:53:35,754 --> 00:53:37,756
saying that Mr. Han
beat them up to a pulp in the past.

753
00:53:38,006 --> 00:53:39,674
They said it really hurt their pride.

754
00:53:40,091 --> 00:53:43,053
I'm telling you. You're dumb.

755
00:53:43,345 --> 00:53:44,596
Look who's talking.

756
00:53:45,722 --> 00:53:46,890
My gosh.

757
00:53:47,390 --> 00:53:48,266
Damn, It's cold.

758
00:53:51,061 --> 00:53:52,020
Who is it?

759
00:53:57,734 --> 00:53:59,277
It's me, Ms. Park.

760
00:54:00,987 --> 00:54:03,531
What brings you here?
I never ordered anything from you.

761
00:54:03,740 --> 00:54:05,867
I heard that you're back.

762
00:54:09,037 --> 00:54:11,498
That was rude of me. Please forgive me.

763
00:54:12,499 --> 00:54:15,919
How can I continue to earn a living
after my discourteous conduct toward you?

764
00:54:16,711 --> 00:54:19,881
I hope you can forgive me
and I'll do my best.

765
00:54:24,594 --> 00:54:27,222
This is blowfish porridge.

766
00:54:27,389 --> 00:54:30,016
It's still warm. Please have some.

767
00:54:30,225 --> 00:54:31,768
You like this porridge.

768
00:54:33,687 --> 00:54:37,565
Mr. Chairman likes it, not me.

769
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:41,736
He's still at the hospital, right?

770
00:54:44,739 --> 00:54:46,157
You should just eat it.

771
00:54:47,325 --> 00:54:49,619
I heard from Ms. Jo

772
00:54:50,036 --> 00:54:54,082
that you were especially impressed
by the blowfish porridge I made.

773
00:54:54,457 --> 00:54:56,668
That's why I made it for you.

774
00:54:57,794 --> 00:54:59,546
The kimchi has ripened, so it's delicious.

775
00:54:59,629 --> 00:55:00,547
Eat them together.

776
00:55:00,630 --> 00:55:02,465
I'll see you soon.

777
00:55:04,676 --> 00:55:05,593
Right.

778
00:55:05,885 --> 00:55:08,888
I know where Ms. Jo is now.

779
00:55:10,515 --> 00:55:12,350
I'll text you the address.

780
00:55:13,226 --> 00:55:15,770
It's not fair for those
who have committed bad deeds

781
00:55:15,854 --> 00:55:17,272
to live a good life.

782
00:55:38,209 --> 00:55:40,170
It's blowfish porridge.
Come and have some.

783
00:55:40,253 --> 00:55:41,838
-Yes.
-You like it.

784
00:55:43,006 --> 00:55:44,841
All right. Let's eat it together.

785
00:55:44,966 --> 00:55:48,511
Please don't worry about me.
Just have as much as you like.

786
00:55:55,185 --> 00:55:57,312
Try this too. Here.

787
00:55:59,981 --> 00:56:02,650
Good. Eat up.

788
00:56:03,193 --> 00:56:05,945
Keep your eyes on the ball.
Now, lift it straight up all the way back.

789
00:56:06,071 --> 00:56:09,324
One, two. Take a deep breath
and do it again. Hit it.

790
00:56:09,407 --> 00:56:12,077
Great. You did that
with the ball again though.

791
00:56:29,094 --> 00:56:32,222
One, two. Straight. Remember to keep
your eyes on the ball. That's the key.

792
00:56:32,305 --> 00:56:34,057
Nice. That's it.

793
00:56:34,182 --> 00:56:35,558
-Did I do it correctly?
-Yes.

794
00:56:49,155 --> 00:56:51,908
Gosh, Dad! Dad, are you okay?

795
00:56:52,033 --> 00:56:53,326
My gosh, Dad. What should I do?

796
00:56:55,703 --> 00:56:58,039
-Don't these go so well together?
-Yes, totally.

797
00:56:58,665 --> 00:57:00,375
Just a second. Someone is calling me.

798
00:57:01,543 --> 00:57:02,377
Hello?

799
00:57:04,796 --> 00:57:05,713
What did you just say?

800
00:57:17,267 --> 00:57:20,728
Oh, my goodness. Hey, I thought
it was strange that she came back.

801
00:57:20,812 --> 00:57:22,605
That bitch tried to kill Dad.

802
00:57:22,689 --> 00:57:25,150
Who will get all of his assets
if he dies? She'll get everything.

803
00:57:25,316 --> 00:57:27,402
Slow down and tell me what happened.
What do you mean?

804
00:57:27,777 --> 00:57:32,157
Dad lost consciousness after eating
blowfish porridge she gave him!

805
00:57:32,532 --> 00:57:33,825
I want to kill her.

806
00:57:36,035 --> 00:57:39,205
You murderer! Is this what you wanted?

807
00:57:39,497 --> 00:57:41,040
I was wondering why you came back.

808
00:57:41,249 --> 00:57:43,293
Your plan was to kill Dad
and get all of his assets, right?

809
00:57:43,543 --> 00:57:45,503
They're saying the poison
has spread all over his body.

810
00:57:45,628 --> 00:57:48,381
How clever. I can't believe
you tried to poison him to death!

811
00:57:50,383 --> 00:57:51,426
Where are you going?

812
00:57:53,428 --> 00:57:54,596
Damn it!

813
00:58:08,776 --> 00:58:11,196
It's possible that Bok-ja Park
cooked up such a ruse

814
00:58:11,279 --> 00:58:12,947
in order to kill Chairman Ahn

815
00:58:13,198 --> 00:58:15,533
and get her hands on all of his assets.

816
00:58:16,159 --> 00:58:19,120
No, she didn't have any reason to do that.

817
00:58:19,454 --> 00:58:20,872
What do you mean by that?

818
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:10,880
BONG-CHEOL GU

819
00:59:21,599 --> 00:59:25,228
Chairman Ahn was not in his hospital room

820
00:59:25,937 --> 00:59:27,564
at the time of Ji-yeong Park's death.

821
00:59:28,147 --> 00:59:30,483
You and Mr. Jae-seok Ahn are the only ones

822
00:59:30,567 --> 00:59:32,443
that have firm alibis.

823
01:00:06,185 --> 01:00:08,146
I felt bad for Mr. Chairman.

824
01:00:08,521 --> 01:00:11,190
As you know, all of his children

825
01:00:11,274 --> 01:00:13,610
just think of that old man
as their source of money.

826
01:00:14,193 --> 01:00:15,653
That's why

827
01:00:15,903 --> 01:00:17,947
I wanted to take

828
01:00:18,531 --> 01:00:20,241
really good care of him.

829
01:00:21,075 --> 01:00:22,201
But...

830
01:00:23,369 --> 01:00:24,912
But...

831
01:00:25,663 --> 01:00:28,041
Were you really trying to kill Ms. Park?

832
01:00:28,124 --> 01:00:30,084
You better turn yourself in

833
01:00:30,251 --> 01:00:31,461
before I report you to the police.

834
01:00:31,586 --> 01:00:33,379
Should I lie to them
about going to the hotel

835
01:00:33,463 --> 01:00:34,714
to take the money from Bok-ja Park

836
01:00:34,797 --> 01:00:36,633
and everything else
that happened after that?

837
01:00:36,716 --> 01:00:37,759
Say whatever you want.

838
01:00:37,842 --> 01:00:39,218
That bitch is dead now.

839
01:00:39,302 --> 01:00:40,928
I saw it with my own two eyes.

840
01:00:41,012 --> 01:00:42,055
Did you tell the police?

841
01:00:42,138 --> 01:00:44,349
I mean, she came from nothing.

842
01:00:44,432 --> 01:00:45,850
I couldn't stand her being all snobby.

843
01:00:45,933 --> 01:00:49,228
You and Mr. Jae-seok Ahn are the only ones

844
01:00:49,395 --> 01:00:51,272
that have firm alibis.

845
01:00:51,522 --> 01:00:53,983
What should I do, Jae-gu?
I'm so scared right now.

846
01:00:54,067 --> 01:00:55,443
I had to get blood on my hands!

847
01:00:55,526 --> 01:00:57,487
Don't tell me... Did you kill her?

848
01:00:57,570 --> 01:00:59,447
To the point that I wanted to kill her.

849
01:00:59,530 --> 01:01:03,076
Did you think that Ji-yeong Park
intentionally gave you the porridge?

850
01:01:03,159 --> 01:01:03,993
I

851
01:01:05,453 --> 01:01:06,412
died.

852
01:01:07,246 --> 01:01:09,248
