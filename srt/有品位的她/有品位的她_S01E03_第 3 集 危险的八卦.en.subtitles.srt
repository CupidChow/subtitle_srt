1
00:00:40,832 --> 00:00:43,668
I told Ms. Bok-ja Park, to come at 3 p.m.

2
00:00:43,877 --> 00:00:45,336
Please give me a chance.

3
00:00:46,004 --> 00:00:48,381
I'll do my utmost
to take great care of him.

4
00:00:49,257 --> 00:00:52,552
Doctors will use medicine
to cure him physically,

5
00:00:52,969 --> 00:00:55,138
so I'd like to help him heal his heart

6
00:00:55,221 --> 00:00:58,183
by doing my very best.

7
00:00:58,266 --> 00:01:01,603
Jae-seok is ignorant
and he talks nonsense often,

8
00:01:01,686 --> 00:01:04,856
but he's such a great husband.
Don't you think so?

9
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:07,025
So far, yes.

10
00:01:08,193 --> 00:01:10,111
I'll make sure she never finds out.

11
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,948
A-jin is actually more simple-minded
than you think. I bet she has no idea.

12
00:01:14,365 --> 00:01:16,910
I'll make sure that she never finds out,

13
00:01:17,035 --> 00:01:18,578
so just trust me. Okay?

14
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:21,581
Ju-mi is in an awkward position now
because her husband

15
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:23,374
has fallen out of favor with his father,

16
00:01:23,541 --> 00:01:24,959
but she still is the lady of the house.

17
00:01:25,043 --> 00:01:26,711
I'll pay you
all the overdue interest as well...

18
00:01:27,879 --> 00:01:29,380
Is there anything you want?

19
00:01:30,089 --> 00:01:31,466
What do you want to buy the most?

20
00:01:33,009 --> 00:01:36,805
Do you think that I'll let
a piece of trash like you have your way?

21
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:38,807
Know your place, Bok-ja Park.

22
00:01:39,557 --> 00:01:41,309
You're just a maid here.

23
00:01:41,434 --> 00:01:43,937
My father-in-law's caregiver.
Do you understand?

24
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:45,104
Don't

25
00:01:45,897 --> 00:01:47,565
provoke me, please.

26
00:01:48,691 --> 00:01:50,068
If you don't behave yourself,

27
00:01:52,737 --> 00:01:54,114
you'll get kicked out.

28
00:02:16,469 --> 00:02:18,721
JU-MI

29
00:02:22,016 --> 00:02:23,852
-Hello?
-A-jin.

30
00:02:25,186 --> 00:02:26,729
Can you come over for a few minutes?

31
00:02:48,334 --> 00:02:49,544
What should we do now?

32
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:53,548
Let's calm down and find the best way
to deal with it.

33
00:02:53,631 --> 00:02:55,508
She's one sneaky, scary woman.

34
00:02:56,092 --> 00:02:58,595
See? Do you still think
that I'm being too harsh on her?

35
00:02:59,804 --> 00:03:00,972
Let me handle it.

36
00:03:03,141 --> 00:03:04,559
You should go to work.

37
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:06,686
I'll come back
after sending Ji-hu to school.

38
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:50,855
QUEEN BEE

39
00:04:01,532 --> 00:04:03,076
Where did he go this early?

40
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:04,702
He struggles to wake up every morning.

41
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:06,329
That's strange.

42
00:04:18,007 --> 00:04:19,425
Have breakfast before you leave.

43
00:04:19,968 --> 00:04:22,428
No, I'll eat at home.
Otherwise, A-jin will get angry.

44
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:23,888
All right then.

45
00:04:30,561 --> 00:04:32,438
Let's have dinner together. We'll eat out.

46
00:04:32,814 --> 00:04:34,482
-Okay.
-I'll come back tomorrow morning.

47
00:04:35,066 --> 00:04:35,942
All right.

48
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:38,695
Tell that woman.

49
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:40,697
-Which woman?
-Ji-hu's mom.

50
00:04:41,739 --> 00:04:44,367
-What about?
-That you play soccer every morning now.

51
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:51,749
-Where is Dad?
-I'm not sure.

52
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,459
I haven't seen him at all this morning.

53
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:56,671
Right, Aunt Jin-hee will give you a ride
to your English lesson today.

54
00:04:56,754 --> 00:04:58,673
Call her right after class, okay?

55
00:04:58,923 --> 00:05:00,925
-Okay.
-Ji-hu, are you going to school now?

56
00:05:02,427 --> 00:05:03,803
Dear, where have you been?

57
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:05,972
I went to exercise.

58
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:07,515
What?

59
00:05:07,765 --> 00:05:09,517
-Morning exercise.
-What kind of exercise?

60
00:05:09,767 --> 00:05:12,228
-Bike riding.
-What? Bike riding?

61
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,897
How random.
You went out for a bike ride that early?

62
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:17,567
Lately, I've been feeling
like I'm getting old.

63
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:19,610
It's the best exercise
for increasing physical strength.

64
00:05:20,403 --> 00:05:21,779
-Do you want to do it with me?
-No.

65
00:05:21,863 --> 00:05:24,824
I do yoga and Pilates, and I even go
to the gym. I get enough exercise.

66
00:05:25,283 --> 00:05:26,159
Right.

67
00:05:26,534 --> 00:05:27,368
Well...

68
00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:32,415
Am I not getting breakfast?

69
00:05:33,249 --> 00:05:35,126
Go wash up. I'll prepare it for you.

70
00:05:35,543 --> 00:05:36,419
Nice.

71
00:05:44,302 --> 00:05:45,219
What?

72
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:48,347
Ju-mi was right. What should we do?

73
00:05:48,431 --> 00:05:50,433
Has that old man gone senile?

74
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:55,354
I mean, if Dad slept with a woman
in his arms...

75
00:05:55,438 --> 00:05:57,356
You know. Well, I mean...

76
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,357
Can he go all the way?

77
00:05:58,566 --> 00:05:59,817
Can he achieve the goal?

78
00:06:00,902 --> 00:06:02,737
You had no friends in school, right?

79
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:04,781
Weren't you an outcast
that couldn't understand anyone?

80
00:06:05,656 --> 00:06:09,160
Just think of it
as her working overtime at night

81
00:06:09,243 --> 00:06:12,080
-and give her a raise. Then...
-Don't be ridiculous.

82
00:06:12,163 --> 00:06:15,166
Do you think she'd just want overtime pay?

83
00:06:15,249 --> 00:06:16,292
Then, what?

84
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:18,669
Are you saying
that she'd want to marry Dad?

85
00:06:18,836 --> 00:06:20,213
That's just absurd.

86
00:06:20,463 --> 00:06:22,715
That absurd thing is happening right now.

87
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:24,967
That's why I'm talking to you about it.

88
00:06:30,264 --> 00:06:32,517
Is that how you've always worked
in the past?

89
00:06:36,938 --> 00:06:39,482
How many men have you seduced that way?

90
00:06:41,609 --> 00:06:42,693
What are you talking about?

91
00:06:42,777 --> 00:06:45,404
You're here as a caregiver,
so just do your job.

92
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:48,533
How dare you slip into his bed at night?

93
00:06:48,991 --> 00:06:52,620
Did you think that he'd give you a key
to his safe or something if you did that?

94
00:06:54,038 --> 00:06:57,959
You're way out of line.

95
00:06:58,459 --> 00:07:01,420
Mr. Chairman said
that he gets scared at night.

96
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:04,924
It's my duty to look after his health

97
00:07:05,007 --> 00:07:06,634
as well as his mental wellbeing.

98
00:07:07,218 --> 00:07:11,597
That's why I stayed by his side
until he fell asleep.

99
00:07:12,807 --> 00:07:14,434
That's such bullshit.

100
00:07:15,059 --> 00:07:17,145
It looked like you left the door open
for someone to see it.

101
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:18,980
What does that mean?

102
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:20,314
I left it slightly open on purpose

103
00:07:20,398 --> 00:07:22,400
so that no one gets
the wrong idea like this.

104
00:07:22,608 --> 00:07:25,153
I didn't want the closed door to make
anyone's imagination run wild.

105
00:07:25,403 --> 00:07:27,989
Hence, I left it open a bit
to show that there's nothing to imagine.

106
00:07:29,407 --> 00:07:31,325
Do you think that things will change

107
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:33,453
just because you and Father
slept together?

108
00:07:33,619 --> 00:07:34,912
Not a chance.

109
00:07:35,371 --> 00:07:39,250
You're just a maid here.

110
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:41,711
I'm a caregiver, not a maid.

111
00:07:42,587 --> 00:07:45,590
Aren't you a professor?
Get with the times. No one even uses

112
00:07:45,673 --> 00:07:47,049
that word anymore.

113
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:49,093
What a joke.

114
00:07:51,637 --> 00:07:52,805
Apologize.

115
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:54,015
You asked me

116
00:07:54,098 --> 00:07:57,101
how many men I've seduced that way.
I've never done anything to deserve

117
00:07:57,727 --> 00:08:00,062
-hearing that.
-Know your place.

118
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:03,399
Ms. Park, can you win a man over

119
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:05,485
by just sleeping with him once?

120
00:08:06,068 --> 00:08:07,195
Then,

121
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:11,699
why are you still alone
and lonely like this?

122
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:16,454
How dare you run your mouth like that?

123
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:19,415
Just do your job
if you don't want to be kicked out.

124
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:22,585
What did you just do?

125
00:08:23,794 --> 00:08:26,672
In this day and age, you can be arrested
for assault if I press charges

126
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:28,925
against you regarding this.
You know that, right?

127
00:08:31,594 --> 00:08:33,471
Do you read newspapers?

128
00:08:33,596 --> 00:08:34,847
What... What did you say?

129
00:08:37,141 --> 00:08:39,185
You might end up behind bars

130
00:08:40,561 --> 00:08:42,313
before I get

131
00:08:43,314 --> 00:08:45,066
kicked out of this house.

132
00:08:50,655 --> 00:08:52,615
You better watch out from now on.

133
00:09:05,336 --> 00:09:06,420
GI-HO KANG

134
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:12,802
Good morning.

135
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:14,804
I hope that a warm cup of coffee

136
00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:17,223
energizes you and keeps you warm
for the rest of the day.

137
00:09:17,306 --> 00:09:18,891
What? Partner?

138
00:09:20,643 --> 00:09:22,645
He's definitely an oddball.

139
00:09:30,152 --> 00:09:31,487
I hope

140
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:34,532
you have a good day too.

141
00:09:34,615 --> 00:09:36,576
I hope you have a good day too.

142
00:09:49,964 --> 00:09:51,632
Gosh, that bitch.

143
00:09:55,303 --> 00:09:57,680
Ms. Woo would like you to come downstairs.

144
00:10:00,516 --> 00:10:01,392
Have some tea.

145
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:09,859
You must know why I wanted to see you.

146
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:13,112
-Yes, I do.
-Then, please explain what happened.

147
00:10:13,195 --> 00:10:15,656
-It's a misunderstanding.
-Whether or not it's a misunderstanding,

148
00:10:16,073 --> 00:10:19,910
I'll decide how to perceive it
after I hear your explanation.

149
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:25,541
Mr. Chairman said that he was having
a hard time falling asleep.

150
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:30,254
He asked me to stay by his side
until he falls asleep,

151
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:33,924
so I lied down on the bed.

152
00:10:35,343 --> 00:10:39,263
Then, I ended up falling asleep too.

153
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:42,683
That's really what happened.

154
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:44,769
Even if that's true,

155
00:10:45,561 --> 00:10:47,647
what you did is simply wrong.

156
00:10:48,522 --> 00:10:49,398
Ms. Park.

157
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:52,234
You're here as his caregiver.

158
00:10:53,861 --> 00:10:55,112
Of course, I'm aware.

159
00:10:55,196 --> 00:10:57,698
And there's a line
that you must not cross.

160
00:10:58,282 --> 00:11:00,993
Last night, you crossed that line.

161
00:11:01,702 --> 00:11:03,704
-Ms. Woo...
-Please don't try to persuade me by saying

162
00:11:03,788 --> 00:11:06,123
that you had no choice because you wanted

163
00:11:06,207 --> 00:11:08,084
to do your best as his caregiver.

164
00:11:08,292 --> 00:11:12,088
It's only understandable
when it's within reason.

165
00:11:12,713 --> 00:11:14,006
I'm sorry.

166
00:11:14,882 --> 00:11:17,343
I wasn't being thoughtful.

167
00:11:17,426 --> 00:11:18,844
You definitely weren't being thoughtful.

168
00:11:19,303 --> 00:11:21,430
It's more than enough reason to fire you.

169
00:11:23,307 --> 00:11:26,185
Please give me a chance, Ms. Woo.

170
00:11:27,603 --> 00:11:28,896
It was a mistake.

171
00:11:35,152 --> 00:11:37,947
Please don't make another mistake
like this ever again.

172
00:11:38,614 --> 00:11:39,824
Do not cross the line.

173
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:43,244
I won't, ma'am.

174
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:46,163
I'll let it slide for now.

175
00:11:47,998 --> 00:11:49,375
For now?

176
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:52,753
I'll take some time to think about
whether you should be let go or not.

177
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:54,463
I'll be watching you.

178
00:11:57,341 --> 00:11:58,551
Thank you.

179
00:11:58,634 --> 00:12:00,469
-Please get back to work now.
-Yes, ma'am.

180
00:12:00,761 --> 00:12:03,097
Please tell Ms. Jo to come downstairs.

181
00:12:04,473 --> 00:12:06,475
-Sure.
-I'd like you to come with her as well.

182
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:11,188
Sure.

183
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:25,369
There was a room like this in the house?

184
00:12:25,494 --> 00:12:28,330
Ms. Woo is very selective
about whom she lets into this room.

185
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:31,542
We'll go with the simple
and modern style this season.

186
00:12:32,001 --> 00:12:36,130
Please change all the plates
to the ones I got from Artist Hong's show.

187
00:12:36,213 --> 00:12:37,673
Sure, I'll prepare everything.

188
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:48,392
Please change Father's mattress topper
to this one,

189
00:12:48,476 --> 00:12:50,269
and change his sheets to these.

190
00:12:51,145 --> 00:12:51,979
Sure.

191
00:12:58,569 --> 00:13:00,488
I should leave now.
I have a get-together to attend.

192
00:13:02,031 --> 00:13:04,783
Right. You'll be going
to Pung-suk's Kitchen today, right?

193
00:13:04,867 --> 00:13:05,701
Yes, ma'am.

194
00:13:08,245 --> 00:13:10,831
-Please put this rice punch in the fridge.
-Okay!

195
00:13:11,081 --> 00:13:13,834
This is Pung-suk's Kitchen,
a place where various side dishes are made

196
00:13:13,918 --> 00:13:16,212
with certified organic ingredients only.

197
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:21,800
Pung-suk started out as a kitchen helper
for S Group chairman's personal chef.

198
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:24,303
After the chairman died,
she got a hefty severance pay

199
00:13:24,512 --> 00:13:27,431
and bought this apartment
awaiting redevelopment with that money.

200
00:13:28,516 --> 00:13:31,727
Then, she started making
her famous radish kimchi,

201
00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:34,104
which is now known as Pung-suk Kimchi,

202
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:37,691
and has charmed the picky taste buds
of the ladies in Gangnam.

203
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:40,194
She only accepts cash

204
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:42,238
and never pays any taxes.

205
00:13:42,696 --> 00:13:45,699
Satisfying the wealthy's
refined taste in food

206
00:13:45,866 --> 00:13:48,494
has earned her their protection.

207
00:13:49,578 --> 00:13:53,290
The clever ones in the middle class
who spend a lot of time with the rich

208
00:13:53,624 --> 00:13:57,461
earn money through using their sense
of privilege and pretentiousness.

209
00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:06,554
Pung-suk's Kitchen was known
for its delicious food,

210
00:14:06,887 --> 00:14:10,224
but the food wasn't really
juicy and irresistible.

211
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:15,062
"You've never seduced a man in your life.

212
00:14:15,145 --> 00:14:18,524
How dare you accuse me of seducing him?"

213
00:14:18,941 --> 00:14:20,609
-That's what she said.
-My gosh.

214
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:22,653
Did she really sleep with the chairman?

215
00:14:22,736 --> 00:14:23,737
She totally did.

216
00:14:23,821 --> 00:14:26,240
He has diabetes
and he has even had strokes.

217
00:14:26,323 --> 00:14:27,575
There wouldn't be much he could do.

218
00:14:29,451 --> 00:14:32,246
But Ms. Woo didn't kick her out.

219
00:14:32,997 --> 00:14:34,415
That's what's strange.

220
00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:36,208
Why didn't she kick her out?

221
00:14:36,667 --> 00:14:37,501
That is strange indeed.

222
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:47,761
-Come in.
-A-jin.

223
00:14:47,845 --> 00:14:49,054
-Hey, you're here.
-Yes.

224
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,098
-Have you had breakfast yet?
-Yes.

225
00:14:51,223 --> 00:14:54,435
-What is today's schedule like?
-You have the brunch.

226
00:14:54,518 --> 00:14:56,020
Then, you have the wine class at 2 p.m.

227
00:14:56,937 --> 00:14:59,773
At 5 p.m., you're supposed to visit
Ms. Seo at Hawon Gallery.

228
00:14:59,857 --> 00:15:03,277
Ji-hu has her violin lesson at 5 p.m.
and the essay writing lesson at 9 p.m.

229
00:15:03,694 --> 00:15:06,572
The special lecture is next week.
That's it.

230
00:15:07,364 --> 00:15:10,868
Ms. Bok-ja Park sent her resume
via e-mail when she responded

231
00:15:11,035 --> 00:15:13,078
-to the job posting, right?
-Yes, she did.

232
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:14,997
Can you send it to me again?

233
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:16,081
-Sure.
-Thanks.

234
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:17,291
But why?

235
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:19,627
Something's been bothering me.
I just want to check something.

236
00:15:22,171 --> 00:15:24,673
There is a speed bump coming up.

237
00:15:24,965 --> 00:15:27,551
Did you see it?
Did you see the speed bump?

238
00:15:32,848 --> 00:15:34,099
You're a genius.

239
00:15:36,143 --> 00:15:39,021
Hello? That's the place, Ms. Baek.

240
00:15:39,146 --> 00:15:40,314
They offer valet parking.

241
00:15:40,981 --> 00:15:42,900
I'm almost there too. All right.

242
00:15:43,651 --> 00:15:46,070
You'll be arriving
at your destination shortly.

243
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:49,156
Yes, ma'am.

244
00:15:57,706 --> 00:15:59,959
Please just treat me as In-jae's mom.

245
00:16:00,417 --> 00:16:03,045
Don't feel uncomfortable around me
because your kids have quit.

246
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:05,297
All right.

247
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:12,763
The eggs in the Eggs Benedict
is exceptionally soft today.

248
00:16:14,556 --> 00:16:15,599
It's delicious indeed.

249
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:18,352
Since In-jae and Ji-hu
are the only ones left,

250
00:16:18,602 --> 00:16:21,188
the class must feel
like a private tutoring session, right?

251
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:26,068
Right, I heard Ji-hu will represent
the school at the drawing competition

252
00:16:26,193 --> 00:16:28,070
organized by Korea Illustrated.

253
00:16:28,195 --> 00:16:29,613
Ji-hu is even good at art.

254
00:16:29,697 --> 00:16:31,407
It must be hard to help her
choose a career path.

255
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:34,827
Kids who are only good at one thing
makes it easy for their parents.

256
00:16:35,202 --> 00:16:36,954
Ji-hu is good at everything.

257
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:40,290
That's not true, Gi-ok.
You have no idea how clumsy she is.

258
00:16:40,457 --> 00:16:43,877
You're already famous. I guess
you'll become even more famous soon.

259
00:16:44,294 --> 00:16:46,130
Her personal information
is already all over my blog.

260
00:16:46,213 --> 00:16:47,423
There are so many comments.

261
00:16:47,923 --> 00:16:51,010
"She used to be a flight attendant.
She won the Miss Smile pageant.

262
00:16:51,093 --> 00:16:55,139
Her husband's family owns Daesung Pulp.
I go to the same gym as her husband."

263
00:16:55,764 --> 00:16:57,641
I also get a ton of messages
with questions about her.

264
00:16:57,975 --> 00:17:01,228
So many men including married ones
ask me to introduce her to them.

265
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:03,480
Married guys too?
That's considered cheating.

266
00:17:04,231 --> 00:17:05,357
How shameless.

267
00:17:05,649 --> 00:17:08,193
They shouldn't have legalized adultery,
don't you think?

268
00:17:08,277 --> 00:17:11,572
People no longer feel guilty
about cheating on their spouses.

269
00:17:11,739 --> 00:17:13,991
Being attractive is so important
for women.

270
00:17:14,241 --> 00:17:16,994
They say that pretty old ladies
get special treatment at retirement homes.

271
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:22,875
By the way, is it true
that you never had any plastic surgery?

272
00:17:23,417 --> 00:17:24,960
That's right, nothing.

273
00:17:25,794 --> 00:17:27,546
But you look so different
in your yearbook photo.

274
00:17:27,629 --> 00:17:29,465
Well, I guess we'll have to believe you.

275
00:17:29,798 --> 00:17:32,426
What do you mean? Why would I not tell you
if I got plastic surgery?

276
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:34,386
It's nothing to be embarrassed of.

277
00:17:35,262 --> 00:17:37,264
Is that how you feel
about your eyes and nose?

278
00:17:41,477 --> 00:17:43,437
If every woman looked like A-jin,

279
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:46,398
all the plastic surgery clinics
in Sinsa and Apgujeong would shut down.

280
00:17:46,482 --> 00:17:48,484
Gosh, I get so annoyed when I see her.

281
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:49,526
Sorry, Gi-ok.

282
00:18:07,669 --> 00:18:09,379
There's no such thing as a secret.

283
00:18:10,714 --> 00:18:14,301
I know about it, but Gi-ok doesn't.
I mean, not yet.

284
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:15,552
Wait.

285
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:17,513
What do you mean by that?

286
00:18:18,138 --> 00:18:19,973
You must know what I'm talking about.

287
00:18:21,391 --> 00:18:24,394
What are you trying to say?

288
00:18:24,561 --> 00:18:28,148
I hope it ends before Gi-ok finds out.

289
00:18:28,816 --> 00:18:30,567
I don't know what it is that you know,

290
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,569
but it must be a misunderstanding.

291
00:18:33,403 --> 00:18:34,696
Then, I'd be relieved.

292
00:18:45,707 --> 00:18:47,751
Gyeong-hui, the water.

293
00:19:00,556 --> 00:19:02,015
Where did my hearing aids go?

294
00:19:02,432 --> 00:19:03,559
I can't hear anything.

295
00:19:34,423 --> 00:19:36,425
What are you thinking about?

296
00:19:37,968 --> 00:19:39,303
It's nothing.

297
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:42,222
Sir, shall I read a book aloud for you?

298
00:19:42,639 --> 00:19:43,515
It's okay.

299
00:19:43,724 --> 00:19:46,185
Let's just watch a movie today.

300
00:20:07,581 --> 00:20:10,792
Soy sauce marinated crab isn't good
for those with diabetes,

301
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:12,669
so please don't eat too much of it.

302
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:15,088
They say that food and medicine
come from the same source.

303
00:20:15,255 --> 00:20:16,173
What does that mean?

304
00:20:16,381 --> 00:20:19,843
It means that good food
can be like medicine in and of itself.

305
00:20:20,093 --> 00:20:23,764
When we crave for something,
we must eat it even if it's not healthy

306
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:25,557
because the joy from it will help us heal.

307
00:20:25,849 --> 00:20:26,767
My gosh.

308
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:27,726
Sir.

309
00:20:31,188 --> 00:20:33,607
I'll take you
to your kinesiotherapy session

310
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:35,901
instead of Secretary Oh today.

311
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:37,110
All right.

312
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:40,030
Ms. Jo.

313
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:47,162
I'm going to take Mr. Chairman
to his kinesiotherapy session,

314
00:20:47,371 --> 00:20:51,625
so please kindly change the curtains
in his room for me.

315
00:20:53,877 --> 00:20:56,505
-Sure.
-And please don't worry

316
00:20:56,755 --> 00:20:59,716
about cleaning my room
when you're cleaning upstairs today.

317
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:01,885
I'll do it myself.

318
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:03,637
Okay.

319
00:21:07,683 --> 00:21:09,893
BOK-JA PARK'S RESUME
DATE OF BIRTH: AUGUST 13TH, 1972

320
00:21:11,395 --> 00:21:12,771
Trust and doubt.

321
00:21:13,146 --> 00:21:15,482
When we encounter a crossroads
in our pursuit of truth,

322
00:21:15,857 --> 00:21:19,611
we often choose doubt over trust.

323
00:21:32,165 --> 00:21:33,041
Hello?

324
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:34,126
Hello.

325
00:21:34,418 --> 00:21:36,169
You know who I am, right?

326
00:21:37,254 --> 00:21:38,922
Your partner in the meditation class.

327
00:21:41,508 --> 00:21:44,428
Yes, of course. Hello, partner.

328
00:21:45,387 --> 00:21:48,682
Well, I'm actually calling
to ask you a favor.

329
00:21:48,765 --> 00:21:50,100
Sure, go ahead.

330
00:21:51,268 --> 00:21:54,271
By any chance,
can you do a background check...

331
00:21:54,771 --> 00:21:57,774
I mean if I give you
a social security number,

332
00:21:57,858 --> 00:22:00,527
would you be able to investigate
that person's past?

333
00:22:00,944 --> 00:22:03,030
I was wondering if it'd be possible.

334
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,948
-I see.
-It's too much to ask, right?

335
00:22:05,032 --> 00:22:05,866
Yes, it is.

336
00:22:07,743 --> 00:22:10,454
All right.
Please don't worry about it then.

337
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:12,789
It is illegal,

338
00:22:12,873 --> 00:22:15,459
but the court often cooperates
when it leads to a civil suit.

339
00:22:15,584 --> 00:22:18,086
If you need it done, I can utilize

340
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:19,838
my connections for you.

341
00:22:20,797 --> 00:22:22,299
No, it's okay.
Please just forget about it.

342
00:22:22,382 --> 00:22:24,301
I was just kidding, so don't be like that.

343
00:22:24,509 --> 00:22:25,510
Please don't worry.

344
00:22:25,719 --> 00:22:28,138
Why don't you give me the person's

345
00:22:28,305 --> 00:22:29,514
social security number and name?

346
00:22:30,265 --> 00:22:31,349
All right then.

347
00:22:34,603 --> 00:22:37,314
-It's 720813...
-Yes.

348
00:22:37,773 --> 00:22:42,277
It's because doubt is the best way
to defend oneself.

349
00:22:42,736 --> 00:22:47,240
However, no one can guarantee its outcome.

350
00:22:57,292 --> 00:22:58,335
Did you want to see me, sir?

351
00:22:58,585 --> 00:23:01,671
I'm busy, so I'll get right to the point.
Did you sleep with my wife?

352
00:23:03,715 --> 00:23:04,549
Pardon?

353
00:23:04,925 --> 00:23:06,593
No, I didn't.

354
00:23:08,261 --> 00:23:09,554
Then, what happened?

355
00:23:10,263 --> 00:23:11,973
Tell me the truth.

356
00:23:12,265 --> 00:23:15,769
If you don't, I'll smash your head
with this golf club.

357
00:23:16,728 --> 00:23:20,065
Just be honest. I won't care
even if you say that you slept with her.

358
00:23:20,732 --> 00:23:22,192
I absolutely didn't, sir.

359
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:24,903
Sit.

360
00:23:29,199 --> 00:23:30,200
Then, what is it?

361
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:35,580
Listen, you need to curry favor with me.

362
00:23:35,664 --> 00:23:38,125
My wife will have nothing
if I kick her out.

363
00:23:39,835 --> 00:23:42,587
She has a man.

364
00:23:45,632 --> 00:23:48,009
Right, I'm not surprised.

365
00:23:48,844 --> 00:23:51,346
-I found out about it, so...
-So, what?

366
00:23:52,347 --> 00:23:54,307
I gave her a few cards to choose from.

367
00:23:54,391 --> 00:23:55,600
You punk.

368
00:23:56,017 --> 00:23:58,728
No figure of speech, please.
Put it in simple words.

369
00:23:58,937 --> 00:24:00,188
What do you mean by cards?

370
00:24:01,857 --> 00:24:04,151
-I asked her for money.
-You prick!

371
00:24:04,901 --> 00:24:05,902
I'm so sorry.

372
00:24:06,653 --> 00:24:09,823
Gosh, this son of a bitch.

373
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:13,326
So? How much did you get?

374
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:15,912
She gave me 30 million won.

375
00:24:16,454 --> 00:24:19,332
And you also asked her
for a permanent position, right?

376
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:21,126
Yes, sir.

377
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:29,467
You probably didn't know
that I used to be a thug.

378
00:24:30,886 --> 00:24:33,680
I only started playing golf
with this golf club a few years ago.

379
00:24:34,097 --> 00:24:37,517
Before that, I used to use it to smash
people's heads and break their legs.

380
00:24:38,435 --> 00:24:40,437
Now, listen to me carefully

381
00:24:40,979 --> 00:24:42,397
if you want to stay alive.

382
00:24:42,981 --> 00:24:43,857
Do you understand?

383
00:24:53,992 --> 00:24:55,202
By the way,

384
00:24:56,369 --> 00:24:57,787
what's the title of this painting?

385
00:24:57,871 --> 00:24:58,705
That painting?

386
00:24:58,788 --> 00:25:01,124
I wanted to celebrate
Daesung Pulp's success,

387
00:25:01,416 --> 00:25:03,668
-so I titled it as Celebration.
-That's such a nice title.

388
00:25:03,877 --> 00:25:04,836
Celebration.

389
00:25:05,003 --> 00:25:07,005
I'm working now. I'll see you later.

390
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,011
Celebration.

391
00:25:17,849 --> 00:25:18,725
Who is it?

392
00:25:18,808 --> 00:25:20,477
JAE-SEOK AHN

393
00:25:22,729 --> 00:25:24,856
The stamina-boosting pills
you told me about the other day,

394
00:25:25,148 --> 00:25:27,234
get me some, please!

395
00:25:34,115 --> 00:25:37,744
Mr. Ahn, where would you like the bicycle
to be delivered?

396
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:40,163
Should I tell them
to deliver it to your place?

397
00:25:40,705 --> 00:25:43,083
Yes, that'd be great.

398
00:25:46,503 --> 00:25:47,921
Celebration.

399
00:25:48,004 --> 00:25:49,881
OFFICE OF EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR

400
00:25:53,176 --> 00:25:56,721
Jeez, he makes me do absurd things.
I can't take this anymore.

401
00:26:10,068 --> 00:26:12,028
I'm sorry I can't say hello
to you properly, Dr. Jang.

402
00:26:12,654 --> 00:26:13,738
It's been three months, right?

403
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:15,782
Let's skip Botox
between your eyebrows today.

404
00:26:15,865 --> 00:26:16,866
Just get Derma Toxin.

405
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:19,119
Can't you just do them at the same time?

406
00:26:19,202 --> 00:26:21,413
I suggest you wait another month
for the Botox injection.

407
00:26:21,538 --> 00:26:24,666
Some patients who have been
getting them at the same time

408
00:26:24,916 --> 00:26:26,751
have experienced side effects
on their eyelids.

409
00:26:26,835 --> 00:26:28,169
All right then.

410
00:26:32,215 --> 00:26:34,175
There is one thing
that can never be fully satisfied.

411
00:26:34,592 --> 00:26:37,846
It's human desires.
They're insatiable and endless.

412
00:26:57,073 --> 00:27:01,244
Please don't worry about cleaning my room
when you're cleaning upstairs today.

413
00:27:02,037 --> 00:27:03,413
I'll do it myself.

414
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:11,106
Current health condition, Family members

415
00:28:20,365 --> 00:28:23,118
I told you to never come into my room.

416
00:28:23,451 --> 00:28:26,287
I was just...

417
00:28:26,996 --> 00:28:28,039
I'm sorry.

418
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:40,176
Do you know what the most
unfortunate thing in the whole world is?

419
00:28:40,677 --> 00:28:43,096
It's the eyes that saw
what they shouldn't have seen

420
00:28:43,179 --> 00:28:46,141
and the tongue that disclosed
what was seen.

421
00:28:47,809 --> 00:28:52,063
Do not make a mistake
like this ever again.

422
00:28:59,654 --> 00:29:01,197
I'll let it slide this time.

423
00:29:02,365 --> 00:29:03,783
I'll be watching you though.

424
00:29:31,978 --> 00:29:35,106
Once the mask falls off
and exposes the desires underneath,

425
00:29:35,565 --> 00:29:37,942
they do not stop.

426
00:30:01,049 --> 00:30:03,468
A-JIN

427
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:17,941
Ms. Park, can you win a man over

428
00:30:18,024 --> 00:30:19,776
by just sleeping with him once?

429
00:30:20,235 --> 00:30:21,277
Then,

430
00:30:21,444 --> 00:30:25,406
why are you still alone
and lonely like this?

431
00:30:31,371 --> 00:30:34,332
Okay, please push out as you come up.

432
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:36,668
All the way up.

433
00:30:42,048 --> 00:30:44,175
Hold it there for a few seconds.
Now, you'll come up again.

434
00:30:44,259 --> 00:30:46,511
As you're coming up, push out all the way.

435
00:30:46,761 --> 00:30:48,596
Go back down now and hold it there.

436
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:51,307
Mr. Chairman.
Gosh, that's enough for today.

437
00:30:51,683 --> 00:30:53,434
You'll get muscle cramps.

438
00:30:53,518 --> 00:30:56,437
Okay, please come up again. Push up. More!

439
00:30:56,646 --> 00:30:59,691
People desire things that they don't have.

440
00:31:04,028 --> 00:31:07,615
That's where all of our misfortunes began.

441
00:31:13,454 --> 00:31:17,041
It took a while for even Takashi Murakami
and Jeff Koons to receive recognition.

442
00:31:17,333 --> 00:31:19,836
Exactly. The same goes for Marcel Duchamp.

443
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:22,422
He wasn't actually the one
who turned the urinal into an artwork.

444
00:31:22,505 --> 00:31:24,382
The marketers who discovered him did that.

445
00:31:24,924 --> 00:31:28,052
Are the works by Seong-hui Yun,
the artist you recommended,

446
00:31:28,136 --> 00:31:30,179
as sensational as Duchamp's Fountain?

447
00:31:30,263 --> 00:31:32,098
Not at all. They're very normal.

448
00:31:34,017 --> 00:31:35,768
The pedestal is too small.

449
00:31:35,852 --> 00:31:39,647
It's not ideal
for the size of the artwork.

450
00:31:41,941 --> 00:31:44,485
-You heard that, right? Make it bigger.
-Okay.

451
00:31:45,904 --> 00:31:48,781
I think that the installation
will look better

452
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:50,116
facing north.

453
00:31:50,241 --> 00:31:52,577
Getting direct sunlight
will make the work less powerful.

454
00:31:52,702 --> 00:31:56,247
There must be a reason
why the artist only used subdued colors.

455
00:31:57,206 --> 00:31:58,541
You're so insightful.

456
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:02,795
Isn't your husband's company
launching menstrual pads?

457
00:32:03,254 --> 00:32:04,130
Yes.

458
00:32:04,881 --> 00:32:06,341
Please help us out.

459
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:09,135
Could the products be placed
at the most prominent spot at your stores?

460
00:32:09,427 --> 00:32:10,970
And please let us do a pop-up store too.

461
00:32:12,388 --> 00:32:15,350
Does Chairman Ahn know that his company
couldn't have grown this much without you?

462
00:32:16,017 --> 00:32:19,812
Does he know who grew his small toilet
paper company into a big conglomerate?

463
00:32:19,896 --> 00:32:21,397
I owe it all to you.

464
00:32:21,564 --> 00:32:23,399
That's why I'm going
to be loyal to you forever.

465
00:32:23,816 --> 00:32:25,902
As usual, I'm going
to help you unconditionally.

466
00:32:26,819 --> 00:32:29,197
And I'm including Seong-hui Yun's work
in the show because of you.

467
00:32:29,364 --> 00:32:32,200
You won't regret it.
You know that I have a good eye.

468
00:32:32,283 --> 00:32:33,660
Of course, I totally trust you.

469
00:32:35,203 --> 00:32:38,289
By the way, all the accessories
that you're wearing

470
00:32:38,373 --> 00:32:40,500
look like works of art.

471
00:32:43,795 --> 00:32:44,879
Here.

472
00:32:47,256 --> 00:32:49,592
I made it. Do you like it?

473
00:32:49,676 --> 00:32:50,802
I love it.

474
00:32:51,678 --> 00:32:53,930
If Johannes Vermeer were alive now,

475
00:32:54,013 --> 00:32:56,015
he would create a new painting.

476
00:32:56,474 --> 00:32:58,935
"A Beautiful Lady
Wearing a Pearl Necklace."

477
00:32:59,602 --> 00:33:00,645
You're such a sweet talker.

478
00:33:01,521 --> 00:33:03,564
You sure know how to win one's heart.

479
00:33:04,023 --> 00:33:05,858
How can I not adore you?

480
00:33:06,067 --> 00:33:08,486
Please continue to adore me, Ms. Seo.

481
00:33:15,785 --> 00:33:19,789
I told you
not to push yourself too hard, sir.

482
00:33:20,289 --> 00:33:23,001
Ms. Park, that's enough.
You must be exhausted.

483
00:33:23,918 --> 00:33:26,838
I'm totally fine.

484
00:33:35,096 --> 00:33:39,058
I'll call you back in a bit.
Please give me a few minutes.

485
00:33:40,893 --> 00:33:42,437
I told you that I'll pay you back.

486
00:33:43,688 --> 00:33:44,772
Is it a creditor?

487
00:33:47,483 --> 00:33:48,317
I have to go.

488
00:33:48,943 --> 00:33:50,111
How much is your debt?

489
00:33:50,611 --> 00:33:51,487
Tell me.

490
00:33:51,904 --> 00:33:53,448
I'll pay it off for you.

491
00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:55,324
Why would you do that?

492
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,618
I'll take care of it myself.

493
00:33:57,702 --> 00:33:59,203
It's impolite to reject such an offer.

494
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:00,955
I told you
that I want to pay it off for you.

495
00:34:01,247 --> 00:34:03,708
Call them immediately
and pay it off right away.

496
00:34:05,835 --> 00:34:07,545
You really don't have to do that, sir.

497
00:34:07,712 --> 00:34:08,755
How much do you owe?

498
00:34:11,591 --> 00:34:12,842
How much is it?

499
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:38,701
I'm exhausted.

500
00:34:43,247 --> 00:34:46,292
JU-MI

501
00:34:50,004 --> 00:34:51,339
Ju-mi, I'm sorry I missed your calls.

502
00:34:51,464 --> 00:34:53,716
That woman is really strange.

503
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:56,135
I bet she moved into our place
with an ulterior motive.

504
00:34:56,219 --> 00:34:57,595
I'm looking into it.

505
00:34:57,845 --> 00:34:59,514
Please don't worry too much.

506
00:35:00,223 --> 00:35:01,057
Yes.

507
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:02,850
I'll see you at home, Ju-mi.

508
00:35:03,684 --> 00:35:04,519
Okay.

509
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:14,070
-Mr. Choi.
-Yes, sir.

510
00:35:14,153 --> 00:35:15,780
-Prune that side.
-Okay.

511
00:35:15,863 --> 00:35:18,199
-It needs to be pruned. It's sticking out.
-Over there, right?

512
00:35:18,282 --> 00:35:19,617
-Yes.
-Okay, no problem.

513
00:35:19,867 --> 00:35:21,828
Yes, right there. What?

514
00:35:22,537 --> 00:35:24,247
That's enough. You can wrap up now.

515
00:35:24,705 --> 00:35:26,999
-I'll just finish this.
-All right.

516
00:35:43,182 --> 00:35:45,476
-Gosh, Mr. Chairman.
-That's enough. Come down now.

517
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:47,937
Your face will get all tanned.
You should go inside now.

518
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:49,313
All right. Let's go back in.

519
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:53,526
Sir.

520
00:35:54,652 --> 00:35:55,611
I will never

521
00:35:57,780 --> 00:36:00,032
forget your kindness.

522
00:36:00,867 --> 00:36:02,785
You paid off my debt.

523
00:36:03,661 --> 00:36:05,329
I'll never forget about it.

524
00:36:06,664 --> 00:36:08,374
I'll devote myself to you

525
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:12,628
and work harder to take great care of you.

526
00:36:14,297 --> 00:36:16,924
Don't overreact.
It wasn't even that much money.

527
00:36:17,341 --> 00:36:19,302
Stop being silly. Let's go inside.

528
00:36:21,929 --> 00:36:23,264
I don't know how to thank you enough.

529
00:36:25,141 --> 00:36:26,726
Come on. Let's go back in.

530
00:36:57,590 --> 00:36:58,799
How have you been?

531
00:37:02,929 --> 00:37:05,514
Well. By the way, I think we should meet

532
00:37:05,598 --> 00:37:07,308
in Hannam-dong or Itaewon from now on.

533
00:37:07,475 --> 00:37:10,603
-Meeting in this area makes me anxious.
-Why? Are we committing bad deeds or what?

534
00:37:10,686 --> 00:37:13,522
Gosh, we're not doing something
that everyone should see.

535
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:17,026
When a man and a woman
have dinner together,

536
00:37:17,151 --> 00:37:18,778
does it mean they're dating?

537
00:37:19,195 --> 00:37:20,738
This is a business meeting.

538
00:37:20,821 --> 00:37:23,407
Daesung Pulp's guest designer and I

539
00:37:23,699 --> 00:37:25,493
are talking business right now.

540
00:37:25,868 --> 00:37:28,162
-Okay, Mr. Executive Director.
-Let's take a break.

541
00:37:28,663 --> 00:37:30,414
-Are you ready to order?
-Yes.

542
00:37:59,986 --> 00:38:02,071
Hey, what happened?

543
00:38:02,655 --> 00:38:05,324
By any chance,
did your husband do this to you?

544
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:06,909
Seong-su.

545
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:09,620
I can't take it anymore.

546
00:38:09,704 --> 00:38:11,205
That bastard!

547
00:38:11,747 --> 00:38:13,249
Gosh, that psycho.

548
00:38:13,457 --> 00:38:16,335
You're raising his child,
and never even complain about anything.

549
00:38:16,419 --> 00:38:18,587
I envy your wife.

550
00:38:20,756 --> 00:38:22,758
You got a medical certificate, right?

551
00:38:23,259 --> 00:38:24,969
Divorce him and move out.

552
00:38:25,052 --> 00:38:27,430
I should at least wait until Yun-jae
graduates elementary school.

553
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:30,516
-He's not your son.
-Don't say that, Seong-su.

554
00:38:30,933 --> 00:38:34,270
I've always thought of him as my own son.

555
00:38:34,687 --> 00:38:35,855
Because of Yun-jae,

556
00:38:37,231 --> 00:38:39,859
I'm still with Bong-sik.

557
00:38:41,027 --> 00:38:42,361
I adore him.

558
00:38:43,863 --> 00:38:45,740
He's very fond of me.

559
00:38:47,033 --> 00:38:48,534
You're too nice.

560
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:53,706
Seong-su. By the way,
you know Ji-hu's mom, right?

561
00:38:53,998 --> 00:38:54,832
Yes.

562
00:38:55,249 --> 00:38:59,253
I think that woman knows
about our relationship.

563
00:39:02,798 --> 00:39:03,883
What?

564
00:39:10,264 --> 00:39:11,599
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

565
00:39:11,682 --> 00:39:13,684
Mr. Kang, I'll get going now.

566
00:39:13,768 --> 00:39:15,644
-Okay. Good work today.
-Thank you.

567
00:39:19,648 --> 00:39:20,566
Here you go.

568
00:39:21,525 --> 00:39:22,485
Thank you.

569
00:39:22,777 --> 00:39:25,529
It sounded urgent,
so I got her financial information

570
00:39:25,613 --> 00:39:27,156
and police record to start.

571
00:39:27,531 --> 00:39:28,491
I see.

572
00:39:29,450 --> 00:39:31,827
May I ask who she is?

573
00:39:34,622 --> 00:39:36,165
She is my father-in-law's caregiver.

574
00:39:36,916 --> 00:39:39,126
I had to find someone urgently,

575
00:39:39,335 --> 00:39:41,253
so I didn't have time
to do a proper check.

576
00:39:42,046 --> 00:39:44,173
I also trusted her too easily.

577
00:39:45,883 --> 00:39:46,717
I see.

578
00:39:46,967 --> 00:39:48,636
She seemed like a good person.

579
00:39:51,472 --> 00:39:54,266
She was convicted of fraud
and embezzlement seven years ago.

580
00:41:03,294 --> 00:41:04,545
Ms. Woo.

581
00:41:09,091 --> 00:41:11,385
Ms. Park, you'll have to leave.

582
00:41:13,053 --> 00:41:14,847
I'd like you to quit and move out.

583
00:41:16,098 --> 00:41:19,977
Ms. Woo, why are you being like this
all of a sudden?

584
00:41:20,352 --> 00:41:22,021
You said that you'd let it slide.

585
00:41:22,104 --> 00:41:24,648
I found out that you've been convicted
of fraud and embezzlement.

586
00:41:26,859 --> 00:41:28,235
Why didn't you tell me?

587
00:41:31,113 --> 00:41:34,158
How could I have told you?
It's nothing to brag about.

588
00:41:34,241 --> 00:41:36,285
I want you gone first thing
tomorrow morning

589
00:41:36,368 --> 00:41:37,620
before Father finds out.

590
00:41:37,870 --> 00:41:40,831
-I was in a bit of a situation.
-I don't want to hear about it.

591
00:41:40,915 --> 00:41:42,249
I don't think I need to hear it.

592
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:44,251
You said that you'd give me
another chance.

593
00:41:44,418 --> 00:41:46,879
Please give me a chance
to prove myself to you.

594
00:41:46,962 --> 00:41:49,882
It's my fault because I hired you
without vetting you first.

595
00:41:53,302 --> 00:41:55,596
I'll pay you for the full month.

596
00:41:55,930 --> 00:41:56,889
Please leave.

597
00:41:59,517 --> 00:42:00,643
Okay.

598
00:42:01,936 --> 00:42:04,897
All right then. I'll leave.

599
00:42:05,314 --> 00:42:09,068
But please allow me to stay
just until Mr. Chairman's birthday

600
00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:13,405
so that I can make
a birthday meal for him.

601
00:42:13,489 --> 00:42:16,075
No, please move out tomorrow.

602
00:42:19,203 --> 00:42:22,039
Mr. Chairman paid off my debt for me.

603
00:42:25,626 --> 00:42:29,004
I was going to think of it as getting
an upfront payment and work hard.

604
00:42:30,339 --> 00:42:34,677
If I leave just after he paid off my debt,

605
00:42:35,553 --> 00:42:38,138
he'll feel utterly betrayed.

606
00:42:38,514 --> 00:42:40,224
I'll explain everything to him.

607
00:42:40,307 --> 00:42:44,395
Are you saying you'll tell him
that I've been in jail?

608
00:42:45,145 --> 00:42:47,523
You're so cruel.

609
00:42:48,232 --> 00:42:52,152
Have you thought about
how it'll make him feel?

610
00:42:52,528 --> 00:42:56,240
Since you have such an easy
and comfortable life,

611
00:42:56,949 --> 00:43:00,494
you must think that everyone who's been
behind bars is a horrible person.

612
00:43:02,746 --> 00:43:04,164
Some people in this world

613
00:43:05,124 --> 00:43:06,959
are victimized and falsely accused.

614
00:43:08,043 --> 00:43:09,420
Their stories would break your heart.

615
00:43:10,421 --> 00:43:13,173
Some are just born with the kind of fate
that requires them to endure

616
00:43:14,049 --> 00:43:16,176
getting locked up
even though they've done nothing wrong.

617
00:43:19,847 --> 00:43:21,223
I promise.

618
00:43:22,808 --> 00:43:24,935
Just until Mr. Chairman's birthday...

619
00:43:26,353 --> 00:43:30,441
Please allow me to stay
just until his birthday.

620
00:43:36,155 --> 00:43:37,031
All right.

621
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:40,159
You can stay until then,

622
00:43:41,118 --> 00:43:42,661
but you must keep your word.

623
00:43:44,288 --> 00:43:45,873
Thank you.

624
00:43:47,249 --> 00:43:51,337
I'll make a birthday meal for him

625
00:43:51,670 --> 00:43:55,299
and tell him everything myself.

626
00:43:56,425 --> 00:43:59,511
I promise you
that I'll explain everything to him.

627
00:44:01,388 --> 00:44:02,473
Okay.

628
00:44:02,973 --> 00:44:04,391
Let's leave it at that.

629
00:44:05,184 --> 00:44:08,145
You must leave after that.

630
00:44:09,897 --> 00:44:10,939
Yes, of course.

631
00:44:58,153 --> 00:44:59,029
Taxi.

632
00:45:02,866 --> 00:45:03,867
To Yangjae-dong, please.

633
00:45:04,326 --> 00:45:06,245
I need to get there
as quickly as possible.

634
00:45:19,133 --> 00:45:20,008
Come here.

635
00:45:20,175 --> 00:45:21,760
-I don't want to.
-Give it here.

636
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:25,514
QUEEN BEE

637
00:45:25,597 --> 00:45:26,974
What do you want to see?

638
00:45:29,643 --> 00:45:31,437
What name will you use to save my number?

639
00:45:32,271 --> 00:45:33,105
Give it to me.

640
00:45:35,149 --> 00:45:37,317
MR. YUN

641
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:39,486
Mr. Yun?

642
00:45:40,404 --> 00:45:42,072
Gosh, that's ridiculous.

643
00:45:42,489 --> 00:45:43,699
What's ridiculous about it?

644
00:45:43,949 --> 00:45:46,285
-It's not ridiculous at all.
-Gosh, stop!

645
00:45:55,919 --> 00:45:57,546
-Namaste.
-Namaste.

646
00:46:09,141 --> 00:46:10,601
He has another mistress now.

647
00:46:11,101 --> 00:46:12,978
-Sorry?
-The CEO of Pungsan Technology.

648
00:46:14,188 --> 00:46:15,522
What goes around comes around.

649
00:46:15,814 --> 00:46:18,692
The one that broke the wife's heart
gets her heart broken by another mistress.

650
00:46:18,817 --> 00:46:21,236
The new mistress thinks that
she'll be happy forever, but he'll die.

651
00:46:21,612 --> 00:46:24,281
Only then, she'll realize that everything
he has is under his wife's name.

652
00:46:25,115 --> 00:46:26,825
That's probably what will happen
in a soap opera.

653
00:46:28,202 --> 00:46:29,828
Life is such a funny thing, isn't it?

654
00:46:30,204 --> 00:46:31,747
That man is really something.

655
00:46:32,331 --> 00:46:33,624
Why does he philander so much?

656
00:46:34,833 --> 00:46:37,085
I saw your husband
at Take Two in Cheongdam-dong yesterday.

657
00:46:37,169 --> 00:46:38,337
He was with a woman.

658
00:46:38,587 --> 00:46:40,631
A woman? Who could it be?

659
00:46:40,714 --> 00:46:43,759
She was very young and pretty.
What if he's having an affair with her?

660
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:45,969
My husband?

661
00:46:46,094 --> 00:46:48,347
I wouldn't even worry about him
if he was that capable.

662
00:46:48,931 --> 00:46:50,474
Any man can cheat.

663
00:46:50,557 --> 00:46:53,227
He gets distracted too easily.
He can't do two things at once.

664
00:46:53,310 --> 00:46:55,020
He's such a klutz.

665
00:46:55,229 --> 00:46:58,524
My husband would never philander
because he's a total germaphobe.

666
00:47:03,070 --> 00:47:04,488
"In here..."

667
00:47:06,740 --> 00:47:09,117
Ji-hu, do you have a boyfriend?

668
00:47:09,451 --> 00:47:10,327
No, I don't.

669
00:47:10,786 --> 00:47:12,788
All elementary school girls
have boyfriends these days.

670
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:14,957
You're not in the position
to ask that question.

671
00:47:17,042 --> 00:47:19,795
Gosh, you're right.
It's so hard to find a decent guy.

672
00:47:21,004 --> 00:47:23,298
Ji-hu, what type of man should I look for?

673
00:47:24,299 --> 00:47:26,134
Someone

674
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:28,470
who is not like my dad.

675
00:47:28,679 --> 00:47:31,098
-Why?
-Because he has no algorithm.

676
00:47:31,348 --> 00:47:33,642
Do you know why I study math so hard?

677
00:47:34,393 --> 00:47:35,561
Because of algorithms.

678
00:47:35,727 --> 00:47:38,772
It's where order and efficiency begin.

679
00:47:38,855 --> 00:47:40,440
My dad lacks it completely.

680
00:47:40,524 --> 00:47:41,525
What does that even mean?

681
00:47:41,817 --> 00:47:45,070
He goes out for a bike ride super early
and dozes off in the evening.

682
00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:47,114
Don't you think that something is wrong?

683
00:47:56,248 --> 00:47:57,332
-Nice.
-Yes!

684
00:47:58,458 --> 00:48:00,794
Wow. Jae-seok, great putts today.

685
00:48:00,919 --> 00:48:03,171
I've been putting it in
pretty well these days.

686
00:48:08,343 --> 00:48:09,261
Go ahead.

687
00:48:14,391 --> 00:48:15,559
-Good shot!
-Yes!

688
00:48:15,934 --> 00:48:17,894
The tailwind is really helping me today.

689
00:48:18,854 --> 00:48:21,273
The guys will go out
for drinks after this.

690
00:48:21,356 --> 00:48:22,274
What should we do?

691
00:48:22,608 --> 00:48:24,735
Hyo-ju, isn't it your turn
to arrange something?

692
00:48:26,445 --> 00:48:30,157
I booked a yacht for the evening
so that we can watch the sunset there.

693
00:48:30,616 --> 00:48:31,533
I'm in!

694
00:48:35,579 --> 00:48:36,496
My gosh, this is nice.

695
00:48:37,497 --> 00:48:38,373
Here you go.

696
00:48:38,874 --> 00:48:41,835
-Gosh, thanks so much.
-It's not for your wife, right?

697
00:48:42,169 --> 00:48:43,086
Of course, not.

698
00:48:43,795 --> 00:48:46,298
Anyway, good luck. I hope all goes well.

699
00:48:46,381 --> 00:48:47,215
Thanks.

700
00:49:01,897 --> 00:49:04,441
Aren't you guys here to serve us?

701
00:49:05,192 --> 00:49:06,985
What are you waiting for?
Introduce your friends.

702
00:49:07,069 --> 00:49:10,072
Ladies, we'll serve
and entertain you today.

703
00:49:11,198 --> 00:49:12,491
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

704
00:49:18,497 --> 00:49:21,083
Nice. That was great. Here you go, guys.

705
00:49:21,166 --> 00:49:22,918
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

706
00:49:34,346 --> 00:49:35,347
All right.

707
00:49:42,187 --> 00:49:43,021
Hey.

708
00:49:43,313 --> 00:49:46,066
You should sit there.
Ma'am, please sit here.

709
00:49:48,485 --> 00:49:49,361
You should

710
00:49:49,778 --> 00:49:51,029
sit there.

711
00:49:51,113 --> 00:49:53,198
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

712
00:49:56,159 --> 00:49:57,369
-Nice.
-I can keep drinking today.

713
00:49:57,953 --> 00:49:59,496
Guys, they're here.

714
00:50:00,247 --> 00:50:01,540
-Oh, my.
-Looking good.

715
00:50:01,623 --> 00:50:03,750
All right. One, two, three...

716
00:50:03,834 --> 00:50:04,668
The four of you stay.

717
00:50:04,751 --> 00:50:06,211
-Yes!
-All of you are staying.

718
00:50:06,586 --> 00:50:08,463
-Go in.
-All right, let's drink.

719
00:50:08,672 --> 00:50:09,715
What's your name?

720
00:50:10,632 --> 00:50:12,551
-Hey, gorgeous.
-Pour me a glass.

721
00:50:12,634 --> 00:50:13,927
Fill up your glass, everyone.

722
00:50:14,052 --> 00:50:15,804
Let's drink until we drop!

723
00:50:16,596 --> 00:50:19,558
Cheers, everyone. Bottoms up!

724
00:50:21,893 --> 00:50:24,396
What about me? Hey, change your seats.

725
00:50:28,775 --> 00:50:30,444
-Okay.
-Gosh!

726
00:50:46,084 --> 00:50:47,878
Ma'am, it's your turn.

727
00:50:52,215 --> 00:50:53,508
Guys, excuse me for a minute.

728
00:50:54,176 --> 00:50:56,720
Hey, can we talk outside for a minute?

729
00:51:02,017 --> 00:51:05,020
You're so gorgeous.
You're totally my type.

730
00:51:05,979 --> 00:51:07,606
I know. Aren't I pretty?

731
00:51:07,689 --> 00:51:09,566
Yes, you are.
I was smitten as soon as I saw you.

732
00:51:13,069 --> 00:51:14,029
Do you want to die?

733
00:51:14,529 --> 00:51:16,490
Gosh, what are you doing now?

734
00:51:16,573 --> 00:51:20,243
Behave yourself, okay? Everyone is having
a good time, so don't make me ruin it.

735
00:51:20,577 --> 00:51:21,495
Do you understand?

736
00:51:25,415 --> 00:51:27,334
Feed all the birds
before you come back in.

737
00:51:27,417 --> 00:51:30,629
Otherwise, you'll end up as bird food.

738
00:51:38,053 --> 00:51:39,095
Cheers!

739
00:51:43,266 --> 00:51:44,559
It tastes even better out here.

740
00:51:45,602 --> 00:51:47,854
-This is so nice.
-Thank you for arranging this.

741
00:51:52,192 --> 00:51:54,236
So, are you saying
that Chairman Choi's wife

742
00:51:54,319 --> 00:51:56,279
does all this for his mistress'
memorial ceremony?

743
00:51:56,363 --> 00:51:58,490
You have no idea.
She even buys all the ingredients for us.

744
00:51:58,573 --> 00:51:59,908
She's one magnanimous lady.

745
00:52:00,826 --> 00:52:02,452
She's like a living Buddha.

746
00:52:02,577 --> 00:52:05,121
That's probably why all of her children
turned out so well.

747
00:52:05,789 --> 00:52:08,917
Her eldest son is a judge.
Her second son inherited the company,

748
00:52:09,042 --> 00:52:10,293
and the third one is a professor.

749
00:52:10,418 --> 00:52:12,879
Her daughter had a rare disease,
but she's fully recovered now.

750
00:52:13,088 --> 00:52:15,048
Good fortune came her way
because she's so nice.

751
00:52:15,131 --> 00:52:18,552
Right, being unforgiving and greedy
at that age won't do her any good.

752
00:52:18,802 --> 00:52:21,096
She can't take all the money
with her when she dies.

753
00:52:21,596 --> 00:52:23,598
So, what's happening with Bok-ja Park?
Will she be let go?

754
00:52:23,682 --> 00:52:25,642
Of course. Ms. Woo told her that she's...

755
00:52:26,810 --> 00:52:29,437
-So? Do you feel better now?
-Gosh. Can't you tell?

756
00:52:29,604 --> 00:52:31,565
I'm so relieved.

757
00:52:38,780 --> 00:52:39,739
Gosh.

758
00:52:39,948 --> 00:52:42,576
Mr. Chairman, you look just like the actor

759
00:52:42,659 --> 00:52:45,787
in the movie, Breakfast at Tiffany's.

760
00:52:45,996 --> 00:52:48,331
Stop it. I look nothing like him.

761
00:52:48,540 --> 00:52:50,208
Gosh, I mean it.

762
00:52:50,458 --> 00:52:52,502
You really look like him.

763
00:52:53,086 --> 00:52:55,171
Let's go out and have a lot of fun today.

764
00:52:55,338 --> 00:52:56,840
Sure thing.

765
00:52:57,048 --> 00:52:59,259
We'll have so much fun today.

766
00:53:01,136 --> 00:53:02,012
All right.

767
00:53:09,019 --> 00:53:10,103
Do you want it?

768
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:15,150
No, sir.

769
00:53:15,233 --> 00:53:16,693
Mr. Kim, pull over.

770
00:53:17,068 --> 00:53:17,944
Yes, sir.

771
00:53:28,914 --> 00:53:29,789
Yes?

772
00:53:30,790 --> 00:53:33,168
Ms. Park, you should try this on.

773
00:53:34,127 --> 00:53:36,671
My gosh. What are you talking about, sir?

774
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:38,298
Just try it on.

775
00:53:38,506 --> 00:53:40,133
I want to see how it looks on you.

776
00:53:51,895 --> 00:53:53,313
Here is your coffee.

777
00:54:15,919 --> 00:54:18,129
Just a moment, Mr. Kim.

778
00:54:21,341 --> 00:54:26,137
Please take a picture of me,
Mr. Chairman, and Cat.

779
00:54:26,805 --> 00:54:28,932
Come here, Cat.

780
00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:33,311
-My gosh, look at you. You're so cute.
-All right.

781
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:36,314
-Let's take a picture together.
-One, two, three!

782
00:54:44,030 --> 00:54:48,159
Sir, shall I dye your hair with henna?

783
00:54:49,160 --> 00:54:52,580
Just dying your hair
will make you look 20 years younger.

784
00:54:53,289 --> 00:54:55,792
Henna is completely safe and non-toxic.

785
00:54:57,836 --> 00:55:00,005
-Sure.
-All right. Let's go in.

786
00:55:00,296 --> 00:55:01,423
Let's go.

787
00:55:09,139 --> 00:55:12,017
Hey, why is your face so tanned?
Did you play golf?

788
00:55:12,392 --> 00:55:13,768
I was on a yacht.

789
00:55:13,852 --> 00:55:17,480
Make sure you wear sunscreen at all times.
Otherwise, you'll get age spots.

790
00:55:18,273 --> 00:55:19,566
Mom, I want food.

791
00:55:19,733 --> 00:55:21,693
Gosh, all right.

792
00:55:29,117 --> 00:55:31,703
I've been craving this so much, Mom.

793
00:55:31,786 --> 00:55:32,829
It's so good.

794
00:55:32,912 --> 00:55:34,914
The kimchi is overly fermented.
It's very sour, isn't it?

795
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:37,584
That's when it's most delicious.
Make me another wrap.

796
00:55:37,667 --> 00:55:38,710
Okay, hang on.

797
00:55:42,255 --> 00:55:43,298
It's delicious.

798
00:55:43,965 --> 00:55:46,843
So? Will that caregiver leave?

799
00:55:47,218 --> 00:55:48,178
Yes.

800
00:55:48,386 --> 00:55:50,555
Father is very fond of her though.

801
00:55:50,638 --> 00:55:52,015
I'm worried about how he'll react.

802
00:55:52,766 --> 00:55:56,144
How much of the company shares
does Jae-seok have?

803
00:55:56,978 --> 00:55:58,438
Why are you asking such a question?

804
00:55:58,563 --> 00:56:01,316
Who will get all of your father-in-law's
money and inherit the company

805
00:56:01,399 --> 00:56:04,486
after he dies? You need to do
the calculation in advance.

806
00:56:04,861 --> 00:56:07,030
That's not what
I should be thinking about now.

807
00:56:07,113 --> 00:56:08,865
I must focus on helping him
recover his health.

808
00:56:08,948 --> 00:56:11,409
Fine. You're a nice person
and I'm so materialistic.

809
00:56:11,493 --> 00:56:12,410
Goodness.

810
00:56:12,494 --> 00:56:15,080
Gosh, hurry up. Make me another wrap
with the sour kimchi.

811
00:56:15,163 --> 00:56:16,956
-Hurry!
-Okay, I'm making it now.

812
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:18,374
All right, here.

813
00:56:18,958 --> 00:56:21,252
I only found out much later
that she was raised without a dad

814
00:56:21,628 --> 00:56:26,841
and that she grew up in an environment
where she had to learn to love

815
00:56:27,175 --> 00:56:28,676
over-fermented kimchi and sujebi.

816
00:56:29,385 --> 00:56:30,678
Eat as much as you want.

817
00:57:00,333 --> 00:57:01,543
I heard that her dad

818
00:57:01,835 --> 00:57:04,462
passed away when she was eight.

819
00:57:04,921 --> 00:57:08,883
After losing her dad,
she never listened to the music

820
00:57:09,259 --> 00:57:10,802
he used to listen to.

821
00:57:11,553 --> 00:57:15,181
She felt that hearing the music
might make her break down,

822
00:57:16,891 --> 00:57:19,477
so she chose to protect herself from it.

823
00:57:30,238 --> 00:57:31,531
You're back.

824
00:57:31,656 --> 00:57:33,491
What's with the cat?

825
00:57:34,159 --> 00:57:36,995
What do you think? It's a cat.

826
00:57:38,204 --> 00:57:39,497
Isn't my cat so cute?

827
00:57:39,873 --> 00:57:42,500
Who told you that you can have a cat
in our house?

828
00:57:42,876 --> 00:57:46,588
I didn't buy this cat.
Mr. Chairman bought it for me.

829
00:58:14,782 --> 00:58:16,117
What is this cat doing here?

830
00:58:18,244 --> 00:58:19,204
Answer me!

831
00:58:21,080 --> 00:58:22,832
I asked you what this cat is doing here!

832
00:58:46,940 --> 00:58:49,442
She said that she'll leave
after making a birthday meal for Father.

833
00:58:49,526 --> 00:58:51,736
She'll really leave, right?
I hope you're sure about it.

834
00:58:51,819 --> 00:58:52,862
Help me put on a show.

835
00:58:52,946 --> 00:58:54,906
You're not my dad's type.

836
00:58:54,989 --> 00:58:56,115
Fix a meal for me.

837
00:58:56,199 --> 00:58:58,952
-I'm a caregiver.
-So, what?

838
00:58:59,077 --> 00:59:01,079
-Are you serious?
-Just act like you know nothing.

839
00:59:01,162 --> 00:59:03,748
I can't believe that woman spoke
so highly of herself in front of me.

840
00:59:04,082 --> 00:59:04,958
Mr. Ahn.

841
00:59:05,792 --> 00:59:07,669
You must have been overworking yourself.

842
00:59:07,752 --> 00:59:09,921
-You should sleep at home.
-Which home?

843
00:59:10,004 --> 00:59:13,925
I saw documents with information
on Mr. Chairman and the family members.

844
00:59:14,008 --> 00:59:17,762
-That can't be.
-I should have vetted her.

845
00:59:17,887 --> 00:59:21,349
Stop being so desperate.

846
00:59:21,558 --> 00:59:23,977
I'll make sure she leaves
right after your birthday tomorrow.

847
00:59:27,272 --> 00:59:30,525
I will never leave this house.

848
00:59:30,608 --> 00:59:33,027
Bok-ja Park! That's enough.

849
00:59:33,444 --> 00:59:34,654
Stop now!

850
00:59:34,737 --> 00:59:36,614
