1
00:00:41,124 --> 00:00:43,168
Living happily with a cat like that

2
00:00:43,334 --> 00:00:46,212
and the person I love

3
00:00:46,629 --> 00:00:47,964
has been my wish.

4
00:00:48,047 --> 00:00:51,968
I discovered something while
I was cleaning her room.

5
00:00:53,261 --> 00:00:57,348
I saw documents with information
on Mr. Chairman and the family members.

6
00:00:57,849 --> 00:00:58,850
Is that true?

7
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:02,103
That can't be.

8
00:01:02,187 --> 00:01:04,814
She was convicted of fraud
and embezzlement seven years ago.

9
00:01:05,231 --> 00:01:06,566
You'll have to leave.

10
00:01:06,649 --> 00:01:10,445
Please allow me to stay
just until Mr. Chairman's birthday.

11
00:01:10,528 --> 00:01:13,990
You went to jail for me.
That's why I'm trying to return the favor.

12
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:15,867
What's the big deal about a cat?

13
00:01:16,201 --> 00:01:18,244
She almost killed father
on his own birthday.

14
00:01:18,328 --> 00:01:21,456
She's the one who made me walk.

15
00:01:21,873 --> 00:01:23,416
I can walk!

16
00:01:23,541 --> 00:01:25,460
She still has to leave the house.

17
00:01:25,543 --> 00:01:27,420
Will Dad be okay with it though?

18
00:01:27,504 --> 00:01:29,088
The cat is not in the house.

19
00:01:29,172 --> 00:01:30,465
I threw it out.

20
00:01:34,803 --> 00:01:35,678
You.

21
00:01:37,096 --> 00:01:37,972
Get out!

22
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:43,520
It's pretty, isn't it?

23
00:01:44,687 --> 00:01:45,522
Yes.

24
00:01:45,897 --> 00:01:47,524
-Do you want to touch it?
-Yes.

25
00:02:06,042 --> 00:02:09,838
It's better not to know
about the things that you can't have.

26
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:04,475
What do you think you're doing?

27
00:03:06,144 --> 00:03:07,478
You're here.

28
00:03:07,604 --> 00:03:09,397
I asked you a question!

29
00:03:11,566 --> 00:03:14,652
Un-gyu, what is going on?
When did you go out?

30
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:17,655
You better explain exactly what happened.

31
00:03:20,074 --> 00:03:21,159
What are you doing here?

32
00:03:21,409 --> 00:03:22,619
Where are you going, Dad?

33
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:24,913
You must be on your way
to visit the caregiver.

34
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:29,500
You don't need to go to the hospital.
She came home a little while ago.

35
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:30,752
I saw her on my way out.

36
00:03:32,837 --> 00:03:34,213
An eye for an eye,

37
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:37,008
a tooth for a tooth.

38
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:40,094
She got rid of my baby,

39
00:03:40,386 --> 00:03:42,263
so I got rid of hers.

40
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:43,723
You...

41
00:03:45,183 --> 00:03:46,851
Stop it!

42
00:03:47,977 --> 00:03:50,146
Stop it before you embarrass yourself
in front of your son!

43
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:51,272
Bok-ja Park!

44
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:54,984
That's enough.

45
00:03:55,693 --> 00:03:56,903
Stop now!

46
00:04:00,031 --> 00:04:01,407
Stop what?

47
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:07,163
Ms. Park is the one
that needs to stop, not me.

48
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:09,582
-What did you just say?
-A little while ago, you called me

49
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:11,251
a maid, right?

50
00:04:11,834 --> 00:04:14,754
You also belittled me like crazy,

51
00:04:14,837 --> 00:04:16,422
slapped me on the face,

52
00:04:17,006 --> 00:04:18,383
and talked rudely to me.

53
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:22,303
I put up with all of that though.

54
00:04:24,013 --> 00:04:25,056
But then,

55
00:04:26,307 --> 00:04:30,186
that little thing can't even talk,
and it's my family.

56
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:32,772
You threw my cat out first!

57
00:04:33,398 --> 00:04:37,318
But still, how can you kick out
Father's eldest grandchild in the rain?

58
00:04:38,069 --> 00:04:41,364
How can you think
that the cat and Un-gyu are the same?

59
00:04:41,447 --> 00:04:44,367
I'm so glad you brought that up.

60
00:04:45,451 --> 00:04:48,204
Un-gyu and Cat are obviously different.

61
00:04:48,371 --> 00:04:51,291
It's not like Un-gyu can't talk
or find his way home

62
00:04:51,374 --> 00:04:52,875
like Cat.

63
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:56,504
I did what I did because I figured
this woman will only understand how I feel

64
00:04:56,587 --> 00:04:59,924
when she sees her son
thrown out in the rain!

65
00:05:01,509 --> 00:05:04,262
Talking isn't enough
to get through to Ms. Park.

66
00:05:04,345 --> 00:05:06,639
This bitch. How dare you!

67
00:05:06,723 --> 00:05:09,309
Ju-mi! Please, Ju-mi.

68
00:05:09,767 --> 00:05:11,144
Take Un-gyu and go to your room.

69
00:05:11,227 --> 00:05:13,187
-A-jin!
-Please.

70
00:05:13,646 --> 00:05:14,814
Please listen to me.

71
00:05:16,357 --> 00:05:17,317
Go to your room, please.

72
00:05:28,077 --> 00:05:28,911
Get out.

73
00:05:30,371 --> 00:05:31,414
I want you out of this house.

74
00:05:37,253 --> 00:05:39,505
I've clearly warned you.

75
00:05:41,549 --> 00:05:43,301
I told you to never cross the line again!

76
00:05:49,932 --> 00:05:50,808
Dad.

77
00:05:51,434 --> 00:05:52,810
Let me inherit my share now.

78
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:55,813
-What?
-I'm going to get divorced.

79
00:05:55,897 --> 00:05:56,898
You little...

80
00:05:57,315 --> 00:05:59,150
Just give my share now.

81
00:05:59,567 --> 00:06:00,985
What's stopping you? The gift tax?

82
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:02,945
Be quiet.

83
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:04,989
How much of the company money
have you spent?

84
00:06:05,073 --> 00:06:06,699
Then, give me the company.

85
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:07,909
Goodness.

86
00:06:09,952 --> 00:06:12,330
Get off if you're going
to keep spewing such nonsense.

87
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:14,957
-Mr. Kim, let's go back.
-Yes.

88
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:17,085
Dad, please.

89
00:06:17,251 --> 00:06:18,544
You promised me

90
00:06:20,296 --> 00:06:22,465
that you'd leave
after Father's birthday party.

91
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:27,887
I...

92
00:06:31,474 --> 00:06:32,725
I won't

93
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:37,230
even take one step out of this house.

94
00:06:48,407 --> 00:06:49,700
What is it that you want?

95
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:55,832
Tell me what you want.

96
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:03,631
You can tell me. What do you want?

97
00:07:12,473 --> 00:07:14,100
What I want is...

98
00:07:17,603 --> 00:07:20,773
Gosh, I'm soaked.

99
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:22,525
Mr. Chairman.

100
00:07:23,651 --> 00:07:26,821
Where were you at this late hour?
My gosh, you're soaked.

101
00:07:27,405 --> 00:07:29,198
I went out to go to the hospital
to see you.

102
00:07:30,032 --> 00:07:32,952
Are you okay? Why didn't you stay
at the hospital longer?

103
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:34,162
You must be in pain.

104
00:07:35,246 --> 00:07:37,582
Gosh, what are you talking about?

105
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:41,210
I'm as strong as steel.

106
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:43,254
Please don't worry.

107
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:47,216
I couldn't stop worrying about you
the whole time I was at the hospital.

108
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:49,969
It was driving me crazy.

109
00:07:51,387 --> 00:07:53,848
Let's go in, sir.
I'll help you get into bed.

110
00:07:53,931 --> 00:07:55,224
My goodness.

111
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:57,852
Would you like to take a hot bath?

112
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:00,146
There's some sake left.
I'll put it in the water.

113
00:08:01,898 --> 00:08:03,441
We have a serious problem here.

114
00:08:05,902 --> 00:08:07,069
What will you do with that woman?

115
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:12,116
Get some rest, Jae-hui.
It's getting late now.

116
00:08:14,368 --> 00:08:16,037
You aren't the only one
who is stressed out.

117
00:08:16,412 --> 00:08:17,371
I'm stressed out too.

118
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:18,623
My goodness.

119
00:08:18,789 --> 00:08:20,666
Jeez, everyone is ridiculous.

120
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:35,181
Sir.

121
00:08:35,556 --> 00:08:37,225
It's ready now!

122
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:39,060
Just a moment, please.

123
00:08:53,115 --> 00:08:53,991
What's that?

124
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:57,411
Raspberries. This will boost your energy.

125
00:08:59,288 --> 00:09:01,999
By the way, what happened last night?
Why was Un-gyu at our place?

126
00:09:03,834 --> 00:09:05,002
That caregiver

127
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:07,004
kicked him out in the rain.

128
00:09:07,296 --> 00:09:09,757
Has she gone crazy? Why did she do that?
There must have been a reason.

129
00:09:09,924 --> 00:09:12,051
Because Ju-mi threw her cat out.

130
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:14,178
Jeez. It's Ju-mi's fault then.

131
00:09:15,179 --> 00:09:17,640
Jae-seok, pick your side wisely.

132
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:19,225
Ju-mi is our family.

133
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:21,686
You could have only blamed her

134
00:09:21,852 --> 00:09:24,814
before Ms. Park got back at her
with something worse.

135
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:27,316
So, are you finally going to fire
that caregiver?

136
00:09:27,858 --> 00:09:29,318
Father won't let me.

137
00:09:29,485 --> 00:09:32,280
Gosh, my dad.
I'm seriously so embarrassed.

138
00:09:32,446 --> 00:09:34,699
He has lost his reason
because he's crazy about that woman now.

139
00:09:34,907 --> 00:09:36,200
-Head out for your exercise.
-Okay.

140
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:43,874
You're the best.

141
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,147
Good morning, Father.

142
00:10:06,689 --> 00:10:07,607
You're here.

143
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:11,193
-Did you have a good sleep?
-I slept like a baby.

144
00:10:11,694 --> 00:10:13,821
It must be because of the sake bath
I took last night.

145
00:10:17,908 --> 00:10:19,160
Hello, ma'am.

146
00:10:19,994 --> 00:10:21,329
Ms. Park, please spare me a second.

147
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:26,876
I need to speak with her for a minute.

148
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:39,597
Ms. Jo, could you give us some privacy?

149
00:10:42,099 --> 00:10:43,184
Shall we have a cup of tea?

150
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:52,735
Thank you for all of your hard work.

151
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:55,613
I'm giving you enough compensation
for all of your work and injuries.

152
00:11:00,618 --> 00:11:02,495
I thought that this discussion was over.

153
00:11:02,912 --> 00:11:06,165
The circumstances have obviously changed.

154
00:11:06,582 --> 00:11:07,875
Don't you know, ma'am?

155
00:11:08,626 --> 00:11:10,086
What has changed?

156
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:14,507
How are you going to deal
with Mr. Chairman

157
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:16,467
if I leave?

158
00:11:19,595 --> 00:11:21,097
Gosh, my back is killing me.

159
00:11:21,222 --> 00:11:23,099
I heard you had done research
on our family.

160
00:11:26,477 --> 00:11:27,686
What is it that you actually want?

161
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:29,647
You haven't given me your answer yet.

162
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:38,531
This teacup.

163
00:11:38,697 --> 00:11:41,075
You know whose painting this is, right?

164
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:44,203
The day we first met,

165
00:11:44,453 --> 00:11:47,665
I asked you if you like Piet Mondrian.

166
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:50,626
To me, that research
isn't anything different

167
00:11:50,709 --> 00:11:54,046
from asking you if you like
the Dutch painter, Piet Mondrian.

168
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,258
I just wanted to know a little
about the family I'd be working for

169
00:11:57,341 --> 00:12:00,010
as well as my employer's background.

170
00:12:00,094 --> 00:12:01,679
That's all.

171
00:12:04,432 --> 00:12:07,184
Ms. Woo, you're not the one who can decide

172
00:12:07,268 --> 00:12:08,978
whether I should leave.

173
00:12:09,937 --> 00:12:13,816
I'll only listen to Mr. Chairman
from now on.

174
00:12:14,024 --> 00:12:16,485
I won't be taking orders from anyone else.

175
00:12:17,319 --> 00:12:19,238
You must leave this house.

176
00:12:19,321 --> 00:12:22,366
Please don't waste your time like this
if that's what you want.

177
00:12:22,491 --> 00:12:24,535
Just go talk to Mr. Chairman.

178
00:12:24,702 --> 00:12:26,537
If he wants me to leave,

179
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:29,039
I'll leave without a single complaint.

180
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:31,667
Gosh.

181
00:12:32,543 --> 00:12:33,502
Mr. Chairman

182
00:12:33,711 --> 00:12:37,047
will get all cranky
if I leave him outside for this long.

183
00:12:39,383 --> 00:12:42,219
Well, I have to excuse myself.

184
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:52,146
Gosh, this is driving me nuts.

185
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:02,823
Isn't it exhausting for you
to come by every morning?

186
00:13:02,907 --> 00:13:04,116
Not at all. I like it.

187
00:13:04,533 --> 00:13:06,494
My wife made
a raspberry smoothie this morning.

188
00:13:07,828 --> 00:13:09,205
I feel bad.

189
00:13:09,538 --> 00:13:11,832
By the way, your bathtub is too small.

190
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:14,251
What can I do? I have a small place.

191
00:13:14,335 --> 00:13:15,461
Do you want a bigger place?

192
00:13:15,544 --> 00:13:17,421
Who doesn't want to live in a big place?

193
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:20,174
Then,

194
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:22,384
shall I pay you more for the design?

195
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:25,638
Then, shall I buy you a house

196
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:27,223
like sugar daddies do?

197
00:13:29,433 --> 00:13:30,351
Hey, don't do that.

198
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:39,026
Oh, boy. Just a moment, please.

199
00:13:41,403 --> 00:13:43,864
I don't want you to do
things like that anymore.

200
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,699
Just tell Ms. Jo to do it.

201
00:13:46,534 --> 00:13:48,452
Gosh, but that's...

202
00:13:48,536 --> 00:13:49,537
Just do as I say.

203
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:14,937
I'll tell you a secret.

204
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:16,730
Ji-hu's dad is having an affair.

205
00:14:17,231 --> 00:14:18,107
What?

206
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:20,734
How do you know that?

207
00:14:20,901 --> 00:14:23,362
I heard that he got some pills
from Dr. Jang.

208
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:26,574
Stamina-boosting pills
that only doctors know about.

209
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:29,326
Goodness. That doesn't mean
he's having an affair.

210
00:14:29,493 --> 00:14:33,205
Apparently, he said no when he was asked
if he's going to take them for his wife.

211
00:14:33,497 --> 00:14:36,041
My gosh, I can't believe that.

212
00:14:40,838 --> 00:14:43,132
Do you know that Ji-hu's dad
is having an affair?

213
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:45,926
Ji-hu's dad?
The executive director of Daesung Pulp?

214
00:14:47,344 --> 00:14:49,346
-Yes.
-How would I know?

215
00:14:50,097 --> 00:14:52,182
I heard that he got some pills
from Dr. Jang.

216
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:53,350
What kind of pills?

217
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:55,936
Apparently, only doctors know about it.

218
00:14:56,312 --> 00:14:58,022
It helps men in bed.

219
00:14:59,148 --> 00:15:02,026
There's nothing weird about him
taking those pills for his wife.

220
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:04,820
He said that he's not taking them
for his wife.

221
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:07,114
Every man cheats.

222
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:12,453
Does that mean the other two guys
are cheating on their wives too?

223
00:15:13,996 --> 00:15:16,874
Dr. Jang even tells his wife
that he's playing golf and goes on trips

224
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:18,792
with his lover from time to time.

225
00:15:20,294 --> 00:15:22,546
It's better to be honest like me.

226
00:15:25,132 --> 00:15:27,885
Ae-ran said that she appreciates
everything you've done for her.

227
00:15:29,011 --> 00:15:31,972
Anyway, don't talk about your lover
in front of your wife

228
00:15:32,056 --> 00:15:33,766
who makes food for you every day.

229
00:15:38,479 --> 00:15:40,189
Look, Hyo-ju.

230
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:43,067
Can you say that you're not hiding
anything from me?

231
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:47,112
Do you need those pills too or what?

232
00:15:47,363 --> 00:15:51,867
Right, your rich husband
gives you all the money you need.

233
00:15:52,409 --> 00:15:54,745
I guess you don't need to meet
an old man for money.

234
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:57,623
Young guys don't need
such pills, you know.

235
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:00,334
I don't care what you do.

236
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:03,045
Just raise my kids well.

237
00:16:04,171 --> 00:16:06,340
I'll put up with everything
if you do that well.

238
00:16:06,423 --> 00:16:07,925
What have you even put up with?

239
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:11,136
You do everything you want to do.
There's nothing for you to put up with.

240
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:13,514
I'm the one who's been putting up
with everything.

241
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:16,892
I still live with you like a total idiot,
fully knowing

242
00:16:17,518 --> 00:16:19,812
that you've practically been living
with your mistress.

243
00:16:21,271 --> 00:16:23,148
You think you're living like an idiot?

244
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:28,404
I heard that all women cheat
on their husbands too these days.

245
00:16:36,912 --> 00:16:38,288
Bring some cold green tea.

246
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:41,333
You grilled dried corvina.
I want to eat it with the tea.

247
00:16:58,142 --> 00:16:59,268
Let's have a quick talk.

248
00:17:11,113 --> 00:17:12,990
You told Ms. Woo, didn't you?

249
00:17:15,159 --> 00:17:16,118
What about?

250
00:17:16,493 --> 00:17:18,120
You must know what I'm talking about.

251
00:17:20,622 --> 00:17:24,376
Did I tell you
to watch your tongue or not?

252
00:17:26,754 --> 00:17:29,882
If you get on my nerves one more time,

253
00:17:30,966 --> 00:17:34,636
I'll make sure you get kicked out
no matter what.

254
00:17:36,805 --> 00:17:38,182
Remember that.

255
00:17:44,188 --> 00:17:45,439
Are you not going to answer me?

256
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:47,107
Yes, I will.

257
00:17:49,485 --> 00:17:52,237
Please clean my room too.

258
00:18:01,371 --> 00:18:02,456
You left the door unlocked.

259
00:18:03,207 --> 00:18:05,793
I had the door open earlier
to let some fresh air in.

260
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:07,294
By the way, you're early.

261
00:18:07,377 --> 00:18:09,797
Because of this dress.
A-jin is home, right?

262
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:11,256
She went to Mr. Chairman's place.

263
00:18:13,425 --> 00:18:15,594
That caregiver is causing so much trouble.

264
00:18:15,969 --> 00:18:17,137
She's now saying she won't leave.

265
00:18:17,262 --> 00:18:19,139
Gosh, she promised that she'd leave.

266
00:18:19,306 --> 00:18:20,599
Now, she's saying she won't.

267
00:18:20,808 --> 00:18:22,017
Goodness.

268
00:18:24,478 --> 00:18:27,773
By the way, are all workout clothes
odor-proof these days?

269
00:18:27,856 --> 00:18:29,900
Mr. Ahn's workout clothes never stink

270
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:32,152
even if he rides his bike in these.

271
00:18:32,236 --> 00:18:34,113
How can they not smell at all?

272
00:18:35,447 --> 00:18:38,534
We also cannot understand
why it collapsed.

273
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:42,079
Structurally, it cannot collapse like that
unless a big tree falls down on it

274
00:18:42,246 --> 00:18:44,456
or someone intentionally
makes it collapse.

275
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:45,958
It's just impossible.

276
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:48,168
My employees said

277
00:18:48,293 --> 00:18:50,504
Ms. Park knocked herself
into the pole when she was startled,

278
00:18:50,838 --> 00:18:53,215
but that's not enough
to make it collapse like that.

279
00:18:54,091 --> 00:18:57,594
Are you saying that someone might have
made it collapse on purpose?

280
00:18:57,886 --> 00:19:01,598
All of my employees are very experienced,
so they rarely make mistakes.

281
00:19:01,765 --> 00:19:04,726
The only thing I can think of
is an outsider tampering with it.

282
00:19:06,311 --> 00:19:09,022
There were so many people here that day.

283
00:19:09,106 --> 00:19:10,399
Aren't there security cameras here?

284
00:19:29,126 --> 00:19:31,211
Gyeong-hui doesn't have
a membership here, does she?

285
00:19:32,087 --> 00:19:33,130
No, she doesn't.

286
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:34,882
Her husband only gives her

287
00:19:35,048 --> 00:19:36,758
eight million won monthly
for living expenses.

288
00:19:37,384 --> 00:19:38,468
That includes expenses

289
00:19:38,552 --> 00:19:40,929
for Yun-jae's education, their cars,
insurances and maintenance fees

290
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:42,139
for their place.

291
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:44,933
Gosh, are you serious? Jeez.

292
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:47,436
Why can't he just give her
ten million won a month?

293
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:48,770
I feel bad for her.

294
00:19:49,313 --> 00:19:52,983
I heard he makes over 80 million won
a month from the rent that he collects.

295
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:54,526
What a tightwad.

296
00:19:54,818 --> 00:19:57,446
I guess he gives her
exactly ten percent of that. Gosh.

297
00:19:58,447 --> 00:20:01,325
By the way, how do you know so much
about her family's finances?

298
00:20:01,742 --> 00:20:04,453
Yun-jae's dad goes to the accountant
that my husband hired for the clinic.

299
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:07,122
You saw the bruise on her arm
when we had that yacht party, right?

300
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:09,208
By the way, is that rumor really true?

301
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:12,252
Yes, that's what I heard.
I think he hits her occasionally.

302
00:20:14,129 --> 00:20:17,424
Why does she put up with that?
Yun-jae isn't even her child.

303
00:20:18,383 --> 00:20:19,551
I feel so bad for her.

304
00:20:19,801 --> 00:20:23,263
That's why I can't help
but care more about Gyeong-hui.

305
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:26,225
Shall we go for aromatherapy tomorrow?

306
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,060
I have plans.

307
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:30,812
Why are you so busy all the time?

308
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:33,190
That guy you introduced to us
on the yacht that day, your partner.

309
00:20:33,982 --> 00:20:35,484
Is he your boyfriend?

310
00:20:36,026 --> 00:20:38,946
What are you talking about?
Those guys are just my friends.

311
00:20:39,154 --> 00:20:41,156
You know I'm a member of a few golf clubs.

312
00:20:41,281 --> 00:20:42,407
I don't believe you.

313
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:46,036
I definitely sensed some chemistry
between the two of you.

314
00:20:46,203 --> 00:20:48,163
Stop being so curious.

315
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:49,790
It's better for you that you don't know.

316
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,460
Why don't you go with A-jin?

317
00:20:53,752 --> 00:20:56,880
She's all over the place these days
because of her father-in-law's caregiver.

318
00:21:01,385 --> 00:21:02,678
Does she know about it too?

319
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:05,222
-What?
-Her husband.

320
00:21:06,014 --> 00:21:07,099
What about him?

321
00:21:07,224 --> 00:21:10,143
I heard that he got some pills
from your husband.

322
00:21:11,561 --> 00:21:12,479
What kind of pills?

323
00:21:14,189 --> 00:21:15,899
Gyeong-hui told me

324
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:19,444
that he got those pills from Dr. Jang.

325
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:21,571
What pills?

326
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:24,408
I thought you told Gyeong-hui about it.

327
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:26,535
Did you have a weird dream last night?

328
00:21:26,827 --> 00:21:27,661
Well...

329
00:21:29,621 --> 00:21:31,123
Gyeong-hui said

330
00:21:31,373 --> 00:21:35,127
that Ji-hu's dad got those pills
from your husband.

331
00:21:35,627 --> 00:21:37,504
She thinks that he's having an affair.

332
00:21:42,217 --> 00:21:44,720
Gosh, that woman is a piece of work.

333
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:46,722
I don't even know what to do.

334
00:21:47,264 --> 00:21:49,850
It looks like she had everything
planned out from the get-go.

335
00:21:50,017 --> 00:21:51,101
I think so too.

336
00:21:51,852 --> 00:21:55,272
Even on your father-in-law's birthday,
she made a grand entrance

337
00:21:55,355 --> 00:21:57,649
and surprised him with a plate
full of pork rinds.

338
00:21:58,859 --> 00:22:00,902
Why did that canopy collapse
right at that moment?

339
00:22:01,028 --> 00:22:04,448
My father-in-law is so moved,
thinking that she saved his life.

340
00:22:04,531 --> 00:22:07,576
I know. That canopy happened to collapse
at the perfect moment for her.

341
00:22:07,743 --> 00:22:10,287
-Don't you think that it's strange?
-It's totally strange.

342
00:22:10,495 --> 00:22:13,790
There are security cameras
by the garden gate and the main entrance,

343
00:22:13,874 --> 00:22:15,667
but that area happens to be a blind spot.

344
00:22:15,751 --> 00:22:18,837
And why did the cat crawl under the table
right at that moment?

345
00:22:21,715 --> 00:22:23,759
My skin looks so dull
because I kept waking up last night.

346
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:29,097
Tomorrow is another day, right?

347
00:22:29,973 --> 00:22:32,059
No more stress for me today.

348
00:22:34,561 --> 00:22:35,687
A-jin, here.

349
00:22:36,646 --> 00:22:37,981
The dress and the handbag.

350
00:22:38,565 --> 00:22:40,692
This turned out
even better than I thought.

351
00:22:47,115 --> 00:22:49,868
Did you really design this yourself?

352
00:22:49,993 --> 00:22:52,954
I eyeballed your measurements.
You should try it on.

353
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:55,957
That bag was designed
to go with the dress.

354
00:22:56,124 --> 00:22:57,542
It's so beautiful.

355
00:22:57,751 --> 00:22:59,795
You know that Ji-hu won a prize
in the drawing competition.

356
00:22:59,961 --> 00:23:01,088
Thank you so much.

357
00:23:01,463 --> 00:23:03,131
I'd like to pay you,
but you keep rejecting it.

358
00:23:03,256 --> 00:23:06,676
Gosh, you didn't have to do this.
You've already helped me out so much.

359
00:23:09,596 --> 00:23:10,639
Just a second, please.

360
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:45,966
-Oh, my. It looks amazing on you.
-I know, right?

361
00:23:46,133 --> 00:23:47,384
I love it.

362
00:23:47,509 --> 00:23:48,552
I'm glad to hear that.

363
00:23:48,885 --> 00:23:52,681
You sure can pull off anything. You made
my amateur design look so high-end.

364
00:23:55,142 --> 00:23:57,978
Don't be intimidated by Ms. Seo
when you meet her.

365
00:23:58,103 --> 00:23:59,980
I got your back,

366
00:24:00,063 --> 00:24:02,190
so you can feel free to speak up.

367
00:24:02,732 --> 00:24:04,067
Thank you so much.

368
00:24:06,403 --> 00:24:08,155
"Her arms, legs,

369
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:11,867
thighs, and waist

370
00:24:12,742 --> 00:24:14,828
looked as smooth as oil

371
00:24:15,036 --> 00:24:17,164
and as undulant as a swan...

372
00:24:17,956 --> 00:24:21,293
Her belly and breasts.

373
00:24:22,836 --> 00:24:25,130
The grapes of my vine

374
00:24:25,881 --> 00:24:27,591
troubled the quiet
that had possessed my soul.

375
00:24:31,052 --> 00:24:32,888
Her waist

376
00:24:33,805 --> 00:24:36,641
accentuated the fullness of her hips.

377
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:41,104
That tawny brown skin and the rouge

378
00:24:41,646 --> 00:24:44,941
looked divine together."

379
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:06,796
-Ms. Baek is here, right?
-Yes.

380
00:25:09,466 --> 00:25:10,467
A-jin.

381
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:11,593
Ms. Baek.

382
00:25:12,219 --> 00:25:15,388
We should have a cup of tea together.
I have two hours to the next class.

383
00:25:15,555 --> 00:25:16,389
Sure.

384
00:25:18,266 --> 00:25:20,143
That many students have quit?

385
00:25:20,352 --> 00:25:22,562
Yes, moms in this area are like that.

386
00:25:23,104 --> 00:25:26,816
They have such an elitist attitude.
They cannot tolerate anyone

387
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:29,361
from the underprivileged
entering their social circle.

388
00:25:29,611 --> 00:25:32,822
They don't even want their kids
to be in the same class as average kids,

389
00:25:32,989 --> 00:25:35,909
yet I accepted so-called problem kids
with bad grades,

390
00:25:35,992 --> 00:25:37,160
so they're pissed.

391
00:25:37,619 --> 00:25:38,620
What are you going to do?

392
00:25:39,454 --> 00:25:40,622
That being said,

393
00:25:41,498 --> 00:25:43,625
can we put up a banner
about Ji-hu getting a hundred percent

394
00:25:43,708 --> 00:25:44,793
on the math competition?

395
00:25:45,877 --> 00:25:46,836
Would you mind?

396
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:52,801
Using a specific student's name
to publicize my institute

397
00:25:52,884 --> 00:25:54,302
goes against my principles,

398
00:25:54,803 --> 00:25:56,012
so I wasn't going to do it anyway.

399
00:25:56,721 --> 00:25:58,640
You don't need to feel bad.

400
00:25:58,765 --> 00:26:00,100
Please don't worry about it.

401
00:26:00,267 --> 00:26:02,269
No, Ms. Baek. Please feel free to do it.

402
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:05,188
Ji-hu's grades have gone up
thanks to your guidance.

403
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:06,439
Please go ahead.

404
00:26:07,148 --> 00:26:11,027
I was hesitant because I thought
it may tarnish the institute's image.

405
00:26:11,278 --> 00:26:13,989
I have to compromise at times.
I need to earn a living.

406
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:17,284
All right. Please go ahead
and put up a banner with Ji-hu's name.

407
00:26:17,951 --> 00:26:19,619
Thanks, A-jin.

408
00:26:25,292 --> 00:26:28,044
The lawyer, Mr. Gi-ho Kang
wants you to give him a call.

409
00:26:28,128 --> 00:26:30,338
I told him I'm with you.
He says he has something to tell you.

410
00:26:35,635 --> 00:26:36,511
Hello?

411
00:26:37,304 --> 00:26:38,805
It's me, your partner.

412
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:40,223
Hello, partner.

413
00:26:40,515 --> 00:26:42,684
I heard you wanted me
to give you a call. What's up?

414
00:26:43,059 --> 00:26:46,813
Well, remember the kimbap I ate that day?

415
00:26:47,063 --> 00:26:48,231
I couldn't digest it at all.

416
00:26:53,403 --> 00:26:54,446
Thank you.

417
00:27:02,662 --> 00:27:03,538
Eat up.

418
00:27:03,955 --> 00:27:06,833
-Gosh, I don't like porridge.
-You're so picky.

419
00:27:07,334 --> 00:27:08,960
Are we eating porridge because of me?

420
00:27:09,252 --> 00:27:11,254
-Yes.
-Gosh, I feel bad.

421
00:27:13,089 --> 00:27:14,841
Eat up.
You should take some medicine after.

422
00:27:14,966 --> 00:27:16,634
You won't get better
if you don't take medicine.

423
00:27:19,429 --> 00:27:20,472
About that woman...

424
00:27:20,972 --> 00:27:21,806
Yes.

425
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:24,017
-The one you asked me to investigate.
-Yes.

426
00:27:24,434 --> 00:27:27,103
I found out that she served
a year and eight months in jail

427
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:29,272
for fraud and embezzlement back in 2007.

428
00:27:29,939 --> 00:27:33,109
She manipulated accounting numbers
and embezzled 300 million won.

429
00:27:33,777 --> 00:27:36,154
The police suspected
that she had an accomplice,

430
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:38,782
but she said
that she did everything alone.

431
00:27:39,366 --> 00:27:42,369
Has she ever been married?
I heard that she had a child.

432
00:27:42,702 --> 00:27:45,330
I don't know whether she had a child
from a relationship,

433
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:47,749
but she has never been married.

434
00:27:50,877 --> 00:27:52,003
She grew up as an orphan.

435
00:27:52,962 --> 00:27:56,049
She was adopted at the age of ten,
but was abandoned for some reason.

436
00:27:56,132 --> 00:27:58,176
She was also expelled from school
in grade ten.

437
00:27:58,676 --> 00:28:00,595
She got her high school diploma
through the GED test.

438
00:28:01,304 --> 00:28:03,556
She worked for a while as a bookkeeper
at one of the companies

439
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:04,933
that supported the orphanage,

440
00:28:05,433 --> 00:28:08,186
but there are no records on her whatsoever

441
00:28:08,812 --> 00:28:09,979
from 2009 to 2015.

442
00:28:13,608 --> 00:28:15,402
You should eat.
The porridge will get cold.

443
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:17,904
Okay.

444
00:28:42,762 --> 00:28:43,596
Ms. Jo.

445
00:28:44,514 --> 00:28:47,475
I'm going out. Please feed Cat for me.

446
00:28:47,851 --> 00:28:48,768
Sure.

447
00:28:50,103 --> 00:28:51,980
Dad!

448
00:28:52,689 --> 00:28:54,232
He went to the office.

449
00:28:56,443 --> 00:28:57,569
Where are you going?

450
00:28:58,069 --> 00:28:59,320
You're dressed to the nines.

451
00:28:59,654 --> 00:29:01,740
I'm heading out
to shop for walking aids for him.

452
00:29:01,865 --> 00:29:03,158
I see, walking aids.

453
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:07,036
He won't recover quickly
if he sits in the wheelchair all the time.

454
00:29:08,621 --> 00:29:10,206
You're so enthusiastic about your job.

455
00:29:11,082 --> 00:29:12,083
Don't go overboard.

456
00:29:12,167 --> 00:29:15,420
I give my best in everything I do.

457
00:29:15,503 --> 00:29:17,297
All right. Good for you.

458
00:29:17,964 --> 00:29:21,301
Please pick up a pair of comfortable pants
for me to wear at home on your way back.

459
00:29:22,969 --> 00:29:25,513
I get that it's just for home,
but I don't know what you like.

460
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:28,099
I wouldn't know what to buy.

461
00:29:28,183 --> 00:29:29,809
Just get whatever.

462
00:29:29,934 --> 00:29:31,978
I think I'll stay here for quite a while.

463
00:29:32,729 --> 00:29:34,814
Didn't you say that you'll leave
sometime next week?

464
00:29:34,898 --> 00:29:37,734
You're going all out.
How can I leave knowing that?

465
00:29:39,194 --> 00:29:40,737
Just buy whatever comfy pants.

466
00:29:40,904 --> 00:29:42,363
I'll be wearing them at home anyway.

467
00:29:43,198 --> 00:29:44,491
Size S.

468
00:29:44,991 --> 00:29:45,909
All right.

469
00:29:58,588 --> 00:30:00,131
That crazy woman.

470
00:30:06,679 --> 00:30:09,516
A high-end designer bag, clothes,

471
00:30:09,766 --> 00:30:11,059
and shoes.

472
00:30:12,268 --> 00:30:13,728
My dad must have lost his mind.

473
00:30:21,486 --> 00:30:22,654
Did they sleep together?

474
00:30:23,154 --> 00:30:24,030
They didn't, right?

475
00:30:24,531 --> 00:30:25,615
They did.

476
00:30:29,202 --> 00:30:32,288
CHEONGSOL PULP, SEONMYEONG,
DAESUNG PULP, GROUP HUE, TAEGWANG GROUP

477
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:36,334
Ours absorbed it the fastest.

478
00:30:36,876 --> 00:30:38,002
Our product is the best.

479
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:41,214
Come in.

480
00:30:49,764 --> 00:30:52,976
This is the artist who's designing
the packaging of one of our products.

481
00:30:57,438 --> 00:30:59,941
I'll head to the meeting room first,
Mr. Ahn.

482
00:31:00,108 --> 00:31:02,318
Sure, go ahead.

483
00:31:07,282 --> 00:31:09,951
You shouldn't visit me at work
unannounced like this.

484
00:31:10,076 --> 00:31:11,578
I was working,

485
00:31:11,661 --> 00:31:14,539
but I started missing you so much
all of a sudden.

486
00:31:14,789 --> 00:31:17,834
I have a meeting.
We're accepting bids for a new project.

487
00:31:18,042 --> 00:31:20,378
What? I guess you're not happy to see me.

488
00:31:20,545 --> 00:31:22,714
Hey, I'm working now.

489
00:31:23,006 --> 00:31:25,425
I have to sell a lot of this
to keep supporting you financially.

490
00:31:25,508 --> 00:31:27,802
That's how I can keep you happy.

491
00:31:31,681 --> 00:31:33,433
Regarding the safety testing,
the FDA says...

492
00:31:37,687 --> 00:31:41,065
We can skip it
as long as it doesn't contain styrene.

493
00:31:52,201 --> 00:31:53,369
Who would imagine

494
00:31:53,453 --> 00:31:55,455
that out of everyone, you get knockoffs

495
00:31:55,538 --> 00:31:57,790
of super expensive designer clothes
made for 500,000 won?

496
00:31:57,874 --> 00:32:00,627
Don't say that.
I don't copy those designs.

497
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:02,003
I only use them as a reference.

498
00:32:02,670 --> 00:32:05,006
I know that. I didn't say anything.

499
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:08,676
By the way, is something bothering you?

500
00:32:08,885 --> 00:32:10,428
You look stressed out.

501
00:32:11,346 --> 00:32:14,349
I am worried and stressed out.

502
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:16,100
What's going on?

503
00:32:16,726 --> 00:32:17,977
It's regarding family matters.

504
00:32:18,603 --> 00:32:21,397
I guess even those with rich husbands
have worries.

505
00:32:21,814 --> 00:32:23,483
Isn't it better to marry a guy
who's dependent

506
00:32:23,566 --> 00:32:26,277
on his salary and worries
about paying next month's rent like me?

507
00:32:28,029 --> 00:32:30,365
Se-hui, being part
of this society is tough.

508
00:32:30,615 --> 00:32:32,617
-This society?
-The upper class.

509
00:32:33,034 --> 00:32:35,578
Their league, their world.

510
00:32:35,828 --> 00:32:38,331
Those who want to enter it,
those who want to protect it,

511
00:32:38,748 --> 00:32:40,500
and those who can't tolerate coexistence.

512
00:32:41,292 --> 00:32:42,502
It's like a battlefield.

513
00:32:42,585 --> 00:32:45,046
That world looks so peaceful to me.

514
00:32:45,129 --> 00:32:46,839
Never. You're the winner.

515
00:32:47,215 --> 00:32:49,384
-I'll try this on.
-Do you want to get shoes made too?

516
00:32:49,467 --> 00:32:51,886
-No, I'll just wear the ones at the shop.
-All right.

517
00:33:02,438 --> 00:33:03,648
Is he in surgery now?

518
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:04,774
Yes.

519
00:33:05,441 --> 00:33:06,317
What kind of surgery?

520
00:33:06,609 --> 00:33:08,236
Revision rhinoplasty.

521
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:09,404
When did he go in?

522
00:33:09,696 --> 00:33:12,281
He's putting her to sleep now,
so he won't be out for a while.

523
00:33:12,365 --> 00:33:14,867
You said it's rhinoplasty.
It should be over in an hour.

524
00:33:14,951 --> 00:33:18,454
Well, the patient doesn't have
any cartilage in her ears,

525
00:33:18,538 --> 00:33:20,415
so I think it'll take a while.

526
00:33:22,417 --> 00:33:25,128
Why are you stammering so much?

527
00:33:25,628 --> 00:33:26,504
Sorry?

528
00:33:26,754 --> 00:33:28,464
Do you talk like that to patients too?

529
00:33:28,673 --> 00:33:30,091
No, of course not.

530
00:33:30,299 --> 00:33:32,760
It makes you look untrustworthy.

531
00:33:34,303 --> 00:33:37,432
Call me as soon as he's out.
I'll go grocery shopping while waiting.

532
00:33:37,598 --> 00:33:38,433
Sure.

533
00:33:44,981 --> 00:33:47,233
I really can't take this anymore.

534
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,652
I have to lie to his wife
so that he can keep cheating on her?

535
00:33:53,114 --> 00:33:54,032
J TOP PLASTIC SURGERY

536
00:34:02,623 --> 00:34:04,167
Gyeong-hui said

537
00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:08,087
that Ji-hu's dad got those pills
from your husband.

538
00:34:08,171 --> 00:34:10,423
I thought you told Gyeong-hui about it.

539
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:13,217
Please pick up.

540
00:34:15,762 --> 00:34:16,804
Gosh.

541
00:34:16,971 --> 00:34:20,349
He should keep his phone by his side
at all times if he wants to philander.

542
00:34:20,933 --> 00:34:22,602
-Pick up, please.
-Try calling her.

543
00:34:23,603 --> 00:34:25,188
-Who?
-His mistress.

544
00:34:26,147 --> 00:34:27,940
Watch what you say, please.

545
00:34:28,024 --> 00:34:30,777
She is his mistress.
You should try calling her.

546
00:34:31,652 --> 00:34:33,446
Why should I bother?
I'm sure they're together.

547
00:34:33,613 --> 00:34:36,908
Just text him. Don't go out of your way.

548
00:34:37,075 --> 00:34:39,869
If Ms. Cha finds out about it,
she'll pull your hair out too.

549
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:54,092
JEONG-HYEON'S MOM

550
00:35:10,441 --> 00:35:11,734
Hey, Gi-ok. What's up?

551
00:35:14,654 --> 00:35:17,698
You said that Ji-hu's dad got
those performance-boosting pills

552
00:35:17,782 --> 00:35:19,784
from my husband.

553
00:35:20,326 --> 00:35:22,078
Did you really hear that from Gyeong-hui?

554
00:35:23,663 --> 00:35:25,081
Yes, I told you. Why?

555
00:35:26,415 --> 00:35:27,750
Did she tell me about it

556
00:35:27,834 --> 00:35:30,002
when it's supposed to be
a secret between you two?

557
00:35:30,837 --> 00:35:32,839
If that's the case,
I feel bad that I've told you.

558
00:35:33,756 --> 00:35:35,842
I didn't know
that you and Gyeong-hui were close.

559
00:35:36,342 --> 00:35:39,303
Weren't you closer to me?

560
00:35:39,846 --> 00:35:41,556
My feelings are so hurt.

561
00:35:43,224 --> 00:35:46,144
I'm sorry. I mean to tell you,
but couldn't find the right time.

562
00:35:51,399 --> 00:35:53,651
She should worry about her husband first.

563
00:35:53,734 --> 00:35:56,112
She's too nosy for her own good.

564
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:58,281
Come and take a look!

565
00:35:58,573 --> 00:36:01,742
These return to their original shape
even if you pull or stretch them.

566
00:36:01,826 --> 00:36:05,246
Get these stretchable pants
for all-day comfort. Two for 10,000 won.

567
00:36:05,454 --> 00:36:06,539
All right, miss.

568
00:36:08,416 --> 00:36:10,293
They'll be super comfortable. Thank you.

569
00:36:10,376 --> 00:36:12,044
-Have a great day.
-Thank you.

570
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:16,757
Get these stretchable pants
for all-day comfort. Two for 10,000 won.

571
00:36:16,966 --> 00:36:18,551
Even if you pull or stretch them...

572
00:36:18,634 --> 00:36:21,429
If that price tag had
two more zeroes at the end,

573
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:24,932
rich people might gladly pay that price

574
00:36:25,016 --> 00:36:26,851
and buy those pants.

575
00:36:27,476 --> 00:36:29,729
That's how they were.

576
00:36:34,567 --> 00:36:36,319
What brand are your dress and bag from?

577
00:36:36,944 --> 00:36:38,529
I got them as gifts.

578
00:36:38,654 --> 00:36:41,741
-From who?
-Ms. A-jin Woo from Daesung Pulp.

579
00:36:43,576 --> 00:36:45,369
Maintain eye contact and make sure

580
00:36:45,536 --> 00:36:48,456
your voice doesn't trail off
when you're talking to someone.

581
00:36:49,790 --> 00:36:51,417
Okay. I will.

582
00:36:51,709 --> 00:36:52,627
A-jin Woo?

583
00:36:53,961 --> 00:36:55,755
I guess A-jin designed them.

584
00:36:56,088 --> 00:36:57,757
Yes, that's what she told me.

585
00:36:59,258 --> 00:37:01,260
Do you know how A-jin and I become close?

586
00:37:02,261 --> 00:37:03,304
No, I don't.

587
00:37:03,429 --> 00:37:06,057
You know that her father-in-law
owns a toilet paper company, right?

588
00:37:06,307 --> 00:37:08,309
-Yes.
-That company wouldn't have grown so much

589
00:37:08,392 --> 00:37:09,727
without her contributions.

590
00:37:10,478 --> 00:37:12,647
They could expand the business
after they started selling

591
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:14,106
their products at our stores.

592
00:37:16,275 --> 00:37:17,151
I see.

593
00:37:17,318 --> 00:37:19,487
She was the reason
why I got their products into our stores.

594
00:37:19,695 --> 00:37:20,988
I could tell that she's trustworthy.

595
00:37:21,948 --> 00:37:22,782
Right.

596
00:37:22,865 --> 00:37:24,825
I'm including your works
in the show because of her.

597
00:37:25,117 --> 00:37:26,410
You didn't study abroad,

598
00:37:26,827 --> 00:37:29,247
and even your paintings
look mediocre to me.

599
00:37:31,457 --> 00:37:32,291
I see.

600
00:37:32,375 --> 00:37:34,168
I don't run the gallery to make money.

601
00:37:34,252 --> 00:37:35,586
I want to support the arts.

602
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:38,464
I should support emerging artists too.

603
00:37:40,216 --> 00:37:42,593
Try to put yourself on the map.
I'll hang six of your paintings.

604
00:37:42,927 --> 00:37:44,887
Talk to the assistant director
about the sizes.

605
00:37:45,513 --> 00:37:46,389
Okay.

606
00:38:04,824 --> 00:38:07,451
PERSONAL CHEQUE

607
00:38:08,661 --> 00:38:11,580
Buy paints and clothes with it.
Something elegant.

608
00:38:11,914 --> 00:38:13,416
That dress isn't bad,

609
00:38:13,624 --> 00:38:15,209
but I want you to show up in something

610
00:38:15,376 --> 00:38:17,336
by a famous international designer
that everyone knows.

611
00:38:17,628 --> 00:38:18,504
Okay, I will.

612
00:38:18,963 --> 00:38:22,300
A charity event for children in poverty
will be held here next week.

613
00:38:22,508 --> 00:38:23,926
You should meet the ladies.

614
00:38:24,093 --> 00:38:25,136
I will.

615
00:38:25,219 --> 00:38:26,053
You can go now.

616
00:38:43,195 --> 00:38:45,156
She's not purehearted.

617
00:38:48,659 --> 00:38:51,287
Ms. Seo, the driver is waiting for you.

618
00:38:51,370 --> 00:38:52,788
I hope he brought a different car.

619
00:38:52,872 --> 00:38:54,290
People can't find out that I go there.

620
00:38:54,457 --> 00:38:56,083
Yes, it's all taken care of.

621
00:38:56,459 --> 00:38:57,752
Above the rich,

622
00:38:58,169 --> 00:39:00,838
there are even richer people,

623
00:39:00,963 --> 00:39:04,925
but these people are in the top percentile
of the upper class. Would there be anybody

624
00:39:05,468 --> 00:39:06,677
to whom they bow their heads?

625
00:39:08,596 --> 00:39:10,639
You'd actually find them
bowing their heads

626
00:39:10,973 --> 00:39:13,059
in the most unexpected place.

627
00:39:16,604 --> 00:39:19,940
It's in front of this fortune-teller
who predicts people's future and fate

628
00:39:20,399 --> 00:39:22,234
through phrenology.

629
00:39:22,443 --> 00:39:24,028
I feel hard blood clots,

630
00:39:24,195 --> 00:39:26,614
and your mastoid process is too developed.

631
00:39:27,698 --> 00:39:29,742
You must be having problems with men.

632
00:39:31,952 --> 00:39:34,163
Your husband and your son take turns
and break your heart.

633
00:39:34,830 --> 00:39:37,249
She used to be an unknown fortune-teller
in a tiny country town,

634
00:39:37,458 --> 00:39:39,752
but after she moved
to Gangnam five years ago,

635
00:39:40,086 --> 00:39:41,754
she joined the nouveau riche.

636
00:39:42,129 --> 00:39:45,299
Please tell me. What should I do?

637
00:39:46,342 --> 00:39:47,802
This is the seventh time.

638
00:39:48,677 --> 00:39:50,471
Why would he do that at that old age?

639
00:39:50,679 --> 00:39:53,641
Your husband will have a stroke
in January next year.

640
00:39:54,558 --> 00:39:56,018
Do you want to prevent it or not?

641
00:39:56,477 --> 00:39:59,146
My gosh, I can't let that happen.

642
00:39:59,438 --> 00:40:01,107
Then, do as I say.

643
00:40:02,817 --> 00:40:05,236
She doesn't give face or foot readings.

644
00:40:05,361 --> 00:40:07,321
Due to her unique method
based on phrenology,

645
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:11,158
you had to book a year in advance
to get your skull examined by her.

646
00:40:13,369 --> 00:40:17,665
Would there be anything different
about these rich ladies' skulls?

647
00:40:18,165 --> 00:40:20,793
Let him continue to sleep
with the woman he's seeing now.

648
00:40:21,710 --> 00:40:25,214
Your husband must keep cheating on you
in order to stay alive

649
00:40:25,297 --> 00:40:26,507
and keep his company afloat.

650
00:40:27,425 --> 00:40:30,386
My gosh.

651
00:40:32,471 --> 00:40:34,932
I can also tell that there are
some problems with your womb.

652
00:40:35,474 --> 00:40:37,810
Your husband can't implant
his energy there.

653
00:40:37,977 --> 00:40:41,021
That's why he keeps cheating on you.

654
00:40:48,070 --> 00:40:48,946
Get out now!

655
00:41:01,208 --> 00:41:02,918
What? My wife is at the clinic now.

656
00:41:03,002 --> 00:41:04,378
-What?
-Hurry up. Get dressed.

657
00:41:04,462 --> 00:41:05,754
My gosh.

658
00:41:05,838 --> 00:41:07,715
-Gosh, seriously.
-My underwear.

659
00:41:07,882 --> 00:41:08,799
Where did my underwear go?

660
00:41:14,805 --> 00:41:16,724
It's been an hour and a half.
He's still not out?

661
00:41:17,308 --> 00:41:20,519
I went down to see what was going on.
The patient woke up too early,

662
00:41:20,603 --> 00:41:22,980
so he had to put her to sleep again.
That's why it's taking longer.

663
00:41:40,206 --> 00:41:42,166
Come on. I need to hurry.

664
00:41:42,583 --> 00:41:45,794
-Right. My car keys.
-Bye, Seong-su. I'll call you.

665
00:41:49,256 --> 00:41:50,132
I'm sorry.

666
00:42:01,644 --> 00:42:03,145
Hey.

667
00:42:04,396 --> 00:42:06,065
-What's up?
-You work so hard.

668
00:42:06,398 --> 00:42:07,483
It's not too bad.

669
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:15,616
You probably work the hardest
out of the three directors here.

670
00:42:15,824 --> 00:42:17,660
Just let Dr. Cha take care
of all nose jobs.

671
00:42:17,826 --> 00:42:19,787
I can't do that to my patients,
it's their request.

672
00:42:20,412 --> 00:42:21,872
By the way, what brings you here?

673
00:42:22,039 --> 00:42:24,250
I couldn't stay home
because I was too frustrated.

674
00:42:25,251 --> 00:42:28,337
I'll ask you quickly and leave.
You better answer right away.

675
00:42:30,089 --> 00:42:32,591
Did Mr. Ahn of Daesung Pulp
get some pills from you?

676
00:42:33,133 --> 00:42:34,009
Yes.

677
00:42:34,134 --> 00:42:35,094
What kind of pills?

678
00:42:36,178 --> 00:42:37,930
They're for male hormone imbalance.

679
00:42:38,013 --> 00:42:39,932
They're like potent
stamina-boosting pills.

680
00:42:40,307 --> 00:42:42,226
But why did you tell Gyeong-hui about it?

681
00:42:43,227 --> 00:42:45,354
Why does she know
about things that I don't know?

682
00:42:46,605 --> 00:42:47,856
My goodness.

683
00:42:48,315 --> 00:42:50,109
People can't keep secrets, can they?

684
00:42:51,068 --> 00:42:54,363
I couldn't tell you because you are
a close friend to his wife.

685
00:42:56,824 --> 00:42:59,201
She came here a little while ago
to get Botox injections.

686
00:42:59,326 --> 00:43:01,745
She brought new patients too,
so I was grateful.

687
00:43:01,870 --> 00:43:04,123
I told her without even realizing it.

688
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:05,874
I've been regretting it.

689
00:43:09,003 --> 00:43:11,755
I see. I was wondering what happened.

690
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:15,009
Anyway, you shouldn't have given him
those pills.

691
00:43:16,302 --> 00:43:19,346
I gave them to him thinking
that they'd improve his marriage.

692
00:43:19,555 --> 00:43:20,973
I didn't know he'd use them elsewhere.

693
00:43:21,557 --> 00:43:22,808
Are you sure about it though?

694
00:43:24,143 --> 00:43:25,269
I think that's what's happening.

695
00:43:26,562 --> 00:43:29,273
-Goodness.
-Let's talk at home.

696
00:43:29,356 --> 00:43:31,609
I'm running behind.
There are patients waiting outside.

697
00:43:31,692 --> 00:43:32,985
Right. Okay, I'll get going.

698
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:40,117
You should take those pills too, dear.

699
00:43:46,081 --> 00:43:50,544
DIRECTOR SEONG-SU JANG

700
00:43:58,886 --> 00:44:01,305
She even made him get
his eyebrows tattooed.

701
00:44:03,432 --> 00:44:04,850
I feel so bad for A-jin.

702
00:44:09,521 --> 00:44:10,939
Just move forward with this.

703
00:44:11,774 --> 00:44:12,608
Okay.

704
00:44:17,446 --> 00:44:18,822
It's another cartoon.

705
00:44:19,156 --> 00:44:21,283
Dad, I told you that it's not a cartoon.

706
00:44:21,367 --> 00:44:24,328
Are you seeing the artist
who draws these cartoons?

707
00:44:26,830 --> 00:44:28,332
I don't like this.

708
00:44:28,999 --> 00:44:29,917
I really don't.

709
00:44:30,751 --> 00:44:32,211
I'm not dating her.

710
00:44:32,503 --> 00:44:34,129
A kiss doesn't mean we're dating.

711
00:44:37,341 --> 00:44:38,509
What's this nonsense now?

712
00:44:39,134 --> 00:44:40,177
Are you drunk?

713
00:44:40,469 --> 00:44:43,263
Dad, I'll take care of the company,

714
00:44:43,347 --> 00:44:45,307
so you don't need to come here anymore.

715
00:44:45,391 --> 00:44:48,268
You've been coming here so often
because your health has improved.

716
00:44:48,352 --> 00:44:50,104
Look at what you're doing.

717
00:44:50,187 --> 00:44:53,565
Dad, these things have to be eye-catching.

718
00:44:53,732 --> 00:44:54,983
This is our strategy.

719
00:44:55,067 --> 00:44:57,528
Jeez, I should just not know
what's going on.

720
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:00,322
Mr. Oh, call Mr. Kim.

721
00:45:00,614 --> 00:45:01,907
I want to go home.

722
00:45:02,116 --> 00:45:02,991
Yes, sir.

723
00:45:08,914 --> 00:45:12,751
I bought the one
with the most eye-catching colors.

724
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:16,004
I bought matching socks too.

725
00:45:16,171 --> 00:45:18,924
-Are you trying to teach me a lesson?
-What are you talking about?

726
00:45:19,049 --> 00:45:21,093
Are you trying to tell me
to never send you on errands?

727
00:45:21,176 --> 00:45:24,138
Gosh, please don't get the wrong idea.

728
00:45:24,471 --> 00:45:26,890
They're known as "Refrigerator Pants."

729
00:45:27,057 --> 00:45:30,144
Once you try them on,
you won't be able to wear other pants.

730
00:45:30,352 --> 00:45:33,439
-They're so comfortable.
-You wear them then.

731
00:45:33,689 --> 00:45:34,731
I don't want to.

732
00:45:35,482 --> 00:45:37,317
I've worn them too many times in my life.

733
00:45:37,901 --> 00:45:39,069
I won't wear them anymore.

734
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:45,993
Did something happen?

735
00:45:46,243 --> 00:45:49,413
Mom, I'm tired.
I'll nap for just 20 minutes.

736
00:45:49,496 --> 00:45:51,665
I didn't get any sleep last night.

737
00:45:51,832 --> 00:45:54,168
No, don't sleep here.

738
00:45:54,251 --> 00:45:56,253
Sleep in my room, okay?

739
00:45:58,464 --> 00:45:59,798
Gosh.

740
00:46:00,507 --> 00:46:03,844
Aunt Jin-hee, I just got a text from Mom.
She says that I should be dropped off

741
00:46:03,927 --> 00:46:06,722
at Grandma's place after the lesson.
We'll have dinner there.

742
00:46:06,847 --> 00:46:08,432
All right, I got the text too.

743
00:46:08,891 --> 00:46:10,559
I should show Grandma too.

744
00:46:11,059 --> 00:46:13,729
-Show her what?
-The videos from Grandpa's birthday party.

745
00:46:14,354 --> 00:46:15,481
She'll enjoy them.

746
00:46:16,023 --> 00:46:17,524
Did you record a video
of your mom singing?

747
00:46:17,608 --> 00:46:20,360
Yes. Did you record a video of me
playing the violin?

748
00:46:20,444 --> 00:46:22,279
Yes. Of course, I recorded everything.

749
00:46:22,362 --> 00:46:25,407
I also recorded a video of you eating
all sorts of things and running around.

750
00:46:25,491 --> 00:46:28,410
Hey, you better delete that video.

751
00:46:28,494 --> 00:46:30,704
-I'll think about it.
-You little...

752
00:46:30,787 --> 00:46:32,456
I won't be able to get married.

753
00:46:34,416 --> 00:46:36,084
-See you later, Aunt Jin-hee.
-All right.

754
00:46:46,178 --> 00:46:47,429
JI-HU

755
00:46:50,432 --> 00:46:53,143
You've been recording a video of me
eating, right? Stop it already.

756
00:46:53,310 --> 00:46:55,854
-This rascal, Ji-hu.
-Seriously, stop recording!

757
00:46:55,938 --> 00:46:58,315
Aunt Jin-hee is telling you
to stop recording the video.

758
00:46:59,483 --> 00:47:01,527
Ji-hu, then record something pretty.

759
00:47:01,902 --> 00:47:03,111
I'll look pretty. Record this.

760
00:47:04,321 --> 00:47:07,908
Then, the chairman suddenly got up
from his wheelchair.

761
00:47:08,367 --> 00:47:10,202
She's one wicked woman.

762
00:47:10,536 --> 00:47:12,204
What should I do now?

763
00:47:12,579 --> 00:47:14,039
There isn't much you can do.

764
00:47:14,456 --> 00:47:16,917
Just suck up to her.
People like us don't have any power.

765
00:47:17,584 --> 00:47:20,128
Does the chairman still like her
knowing that she's an ex-con?

766
00:47:20,212 --> 00:47:21,922
He's head over heels for her.

767
00:47:22,339 --> 00:47:24,883
I wonder what she does for him
behind the closed doors.

768
00:47:25,384 --> 00:47:27,636
It's almost as if he is completely
bewitched by her.

769
00:47:28,220 --> 00:47:30,889
It's so unlike him.

770
00:47:31,265 --> 00:47:34,434
He normally hates letting people
who are not his family inside the house.

771
00:47:34,935 --> 00:47:38,480
Even for housekeeping, he doesn't want
to hire anyone else, but me.

772
00:47:38,689 --> 00:47:40,899
Gosh, I want to know what her secret is.

773
00:47:42,192 --> 00:47:44,987
I'm telling you.
Behind every exceptionally delicious food,

774
00:47:45,195 --> 00:47:47,155
there's a secret that nobody knows.

775
00:47:47,239 --> 00:47:48,824
-Right.
-Something that only I know.

776
00:47:49,116 --> 00:47:51,159
I bet that woman has such a secret.

777
00:48:01,878 --> 00:48:02,796
Sir.

778
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:05,882
We'll make progress starting today.

779
00:48:07,384 --> 00:48:11,805
I'll do everything I can do
to make sure you regain your health.

780
00:48:12,055 --> 00:48:14,725
-Thanks.
-It's my pleasure.

781
00:48:14,808 --> 00:48:17,352
-Please hold my arms and try to get up.
-All right.

782
00:48:17,728 --> 00:48:20,230
Here. You can do it.

783
00:48:21,023 --> 00:48:23,775
Good. Hold this here.

784
00:48:24,943 --> 00:48:29,239
I'll take my hands off now,
so please try it on your own.

785
00:48:29,323 --> 00:48:32,451
-Okay.
-All right. There.

786
00:48:33,744 --> 00:48:34,953
I've taken my hands off.

787
00:48:37,372 --> 00:48:38,624
Yes, you're doing great.

788
00:48:40,584 --> 00:48:43,879
You can walk so well now, sir.

789
00:48:44,838 --> 00:48:49,051
Gosh, sir. Are you okay?

790
00:48:49,509 --> 00:48:51,845
Sir. My goodness. Sir, are you all right?

791
00:48:53,388 --> 00:48:56,183
Ms. Park, shall we live together?

792
00:49:01,146 --> 00:49:02,564
We already live together.

793
00:49:02,731 --> 00:49:04,107
Not like this.

794
00:49:04,733 --> 00:49:05,984
As husband and wife.

795
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:07,277
That's what I meant.

796
00:49:09,029 --> 00:49:10,155
Sir.

797
00:49:10,906 --> 00:49:13,617
I just want to make you healthy again.

798
00:49:13,700 --> 00:49:15,202
I don't want anything else.

799
00:49:15,494 --> 00:49:19,998
A woman like me shouldn't even dare
to dream of having a husband like you.

800
00:49:20,874 --> 00:49:23,710
I'll get better soon.
I will regain my health.

801
00:49:38,475 --> 00:49:42,104
Call Jae-seok.
Tell him to have dinner with us here.

802
00:49:42,396 --> 00:49:43,605
-Shall I?
-Yes.

803
00:49:45,148 --> 00:49:46,149
I can't.

804
00:49:46,441 --> 00:49:49,069
I have a very important meeting today.

805
00:49:50,028 --> 00:49:52,239
Whom am I meeting? It's Mr. Yun.

806
00:49:52,781 --> 00:49:53,949
He's our client.

807
00:49:54,574 --> 00:49:56,201
I promised him that I'd come by today.

808
00:49:57,369 --> 00:49:58,453
I think he's busy.

809
00:49:58,537 --> 00:50:01,123
He works so hard these days.
He's almost like a different person.

810
00:50:01,206 --> 00:50:02,708
I'm glad to hear that.

811
00:50:03,125 --> 00:50:05,669
He has also been exercising
early in the morning every day.

812
00:50:05,752 --> 00:50:06,712
I can't believe it.

813
00:50:06,795 --> 00:50:07,963
-Early in the morning?
-Yes.

814
00:50:08,255 --> 00:50:10,132
My gosh, what has gotten into him?

815
00:50:10,298 --> 00:50:11,591
-Taste this for me.
-Sure.

816
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:18,056
It's so good.

817
00:50:18,348 --> 00:50:20,517
It's chewy, nutty, and soft.

818
00:50:20,976 --> 00:50:23,186
It's delicious.

819
00:50:23,270 --> 00:50:24,646
It sounds like Jae-seok has matured.

820
00:50:32,863 --> 00:50:36,158
Wear these. I bought some underwear
and loungewear for you.

821
00:50:38,326 --> 00:50:39,161
Thanks.

822
00:50:54,676 --> 00:50:56,261
Dear, eat this.

823
00:50:58,513 --> 00:51:02,267
What is this?
It's spicy sea snails with noodles.

824
00:51:07,773 --> 00:51:08,690
Sleep here tonight.

825
00:51:09,691 --> 00:51:10,567
I can't.

826
00:51:12,402 --> 00:51:13,320
Why can't you?

827
00:51:13,737 --> 00:51:15,113
I have to sleep at home.

828
00:51:15,655 --> 00:51:17,365
Why do you have to sleep at home?

829
00:51:17,449 --> 00:51:18,617
My wife will kill me if I don't.

830
00:51:19,075 --> 00:51:21,411
-Why will she kill you?
-That's just A-jin's rule.

831
00:51:21,703 --> 00:51:23,163
I must sleep at home without exception.

832
00:51:24,915 --> 00:51:26,917
That woman's rules don't matter anymore.

833
00:51:28,710 --> 00:51:31,880
It's not like you're seeing me
because she told you to do so, right?

834
00:51:32,839 --> 00:51:33,799
That's true.

835
00:51:34,174 --> 00:51:38,136
What I'm trying to tell you is that
you're already not listening to her.

836
00:51:38,220 --> 00:51:41,014
No, you do not listen
to that woman anymore.

837
00:51:41,431 --> 00:51:43,934
I do understand where you're coming from,

838
00:51:44,267 --> 00:51:46,311
but stop calling her "that woman."

839
00:51:46,436 --> 00:51:48,939
She always calls you Artist Seong-hui Yun,
Painter Seong-hui Yun

840
00:51:49,022 --> 00:51:51,149
or Ms. Yun. She calls you so respectfully,

841
00:51:51,358 --> 00:51:53,068
but you keep calling her "that woman."

842
00:51:53,527 --> 00:51:55,362
That makes her look like an idiot.

843
00:51:55,570 --> 00:51:58,156
Are you taking her side now
because she's your wife?

844
00:51:58,740 --> 00:52:01,910
I'm not taking her side.
I'm just telling you how I feel.

845
00:52:02,077 --> 00:52:03,662
My goal is for all of us to be happy.

846
00:52:05,580 --> 00:52:07,582
-Why are you taking it?
-You don't deserve to eat this.

847
00:52:10,210 --> 00:52:12,712
Hey, don't you dare
do things like that ever again.

848
00:52:14,798 --> 00:52:17,968
I hate it when women act up like that.

849
00:52:18,218 --> 00:52:22,013
How dare you take my food
and throw it out?

850
00:52:23,139 --> 00:52:24,057
You little...

851
00:52:24,349 --> 00:52:25,767
I guess I've been way too nice to you.

852
00:52:25,851 --> 00:52:27,269
You better behave yourself.

853
00:52:27,936 --> 00:52:28,812
Jeez.

854
00:52:29,646 --> 00:52:30,856
I don't want this.

855
00:52:35,235 --> 00:52:37,070
Gosh, seriously. Piss off!

856
00:52:45,662 --> 00:52:47,080
The things that she does...

857
00:52:47,706 --> 00:52:49,207
Gosh, women are really...

858
00:52:50,292 --> 00:52:52,919
They act so entitled
when men are nice to them.

859
00:53:01,887 --> 00:53:03,972
SEONG-JU

860
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:07,434
Hey.

861
00:53:08,226 --> 00:53:09,978
Hey, Seong-su.

862
00:53:10,437 --> 00:53:11,938
Nothing happened, right?

863
00:53:12,856 --> 00:53:14,733
Yes, she believed me,

864
00:53:15,317 --> 00:53:17,027
but why did you say that to my wife?

865
00:53:17,819 --> 00:53:18,778
What did I say?

866
00:53:19,279 --> 00:53:21,281
You told her about Ji-hu's dad
getting the pills from me.

867
00:53:21,656 --> 00:53:23,325
I never told Gi-ok about it.

868
00:53:25,035 --> 00:53:25,911
Oh, no.

869
00:53:26,745 --> 00:53:28,663
I didn't think about that.

870
00:53:29,664 --> 00:53:31,082
My gosh.

871
00:53:31,333 --> 00:53:32,751
I'm really sorry.

872
00:53:33,919 --> 00:53:34,753
Okay.

873
00:53:43,762 --> 00:53:46,389
A-jin? We're on our way now.

874
00:53:46,848 --> 00:53:48,808
There's something I have to show you.

875
00:53:55,273 --> 00:53:57,651
My sweetheart, I'm happy to see you
enjoying the food.

876
00:53:59,653 --> 00:54:00,654
-Eat the spinach too.
-Ji-hu.

877
00:54:00,737 --> 00:54:03,907
You've been recording a video of me
eating, right? Stop it already.

878
00:54:04,950 --> 00:54:06,534
Seriously, stop recording!

879
00:54:06,618 --> 00:54:08,954
Aunt Jin-hee is telling you
to stop recording the video.

880
00:54:10,163 --> 00:54:11,706
Ji-hu, then record something pretty.

881
00:54:14,918 --> 00:54:17,128
The poem I read for you earlier today

882
00:54:17,420 --> 00:54:20,048
was written by the French poet
who was known as a genius,

883
00:54:20,131 --> 00:54:21,633
Charles Baudelaire.

884
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:24,260
Baudelaire was obsessed with Jeanne Duval,

885
00:54:24,344 --> 00:54:27,097
a woman of mixed French
and African ancestry.

886
00:54:27,305 --> 00:54:31,393
She wasn't that pretty,

887
00:54:31,643 --> 00:54:35,689
but she greatly inspired Baudelaire.

888
00:54:35,981 --> 00:54:37,983
You're so knowledgeable.

889
00:54:39,109 --> 00:54:41,903
Ms. Park, how much education did you get?

890
00:54:42,821 --> 00:54:46,491
Gosh. I did get into college,
but I couldn't afford the tuition fees,

891
00:54:46,866 --> 00:54:47,951
so I dropped out.

892
00:54:48,159 --> 00:54:49,077
What about your parents?

893
00:54:51,705 --> 00:54:54,624
My dad was the headman of our village,

894
00:54:54,749 --> 00:54:56,960
but he passed away from cancer.

895
00:54:58,461 --> 00:55:01,464
My mom had a stroke two years ago

896
00:55:01,548 --> 00:55:03,633
and passed away as well.

897
00:55:04,884 --> 00:55:06,344
Do you have no siblings?

898
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:07,846
No, I have none.

899
00:55:08,763 --> 00:55:09,848
I see.

900
00:55:11,099 --> 00:55:13,476
You would have been successful
if you had received a good education.

901
00:55:15,562 --> 00:55:18,565
Even as a little kid,
whenever I saw things written

902
00:55:18,648 --> 00:55:20,567
on white pieces of paper,

903
00:55:20,650 --> 00:55:23,153
I made sure to read every letter and word.

904
00:55:24,612 --> 00:55:25,780
Maybe that's why.

905
00:55:26,281 --> 00:55:28,283
I think you're different

906
00:55:28,658 --> 00:55:29,743
from other women.

907
00:55:38,710 --> 00:55:42,047
-Hey, Gi-ok.
-Shall we have brunch after yoga tomorrow?

908
00:55:42,255 --> 00:55:43,381
I have something to tell you.

909
00:55:44,174 --> 00:55:45,008
Sure.

910
00:55:50,013 --> 00:55:51,598
BLOCKED CALLER ID

911
00:55:58,521 --> 00:55:59,439
RECORD

912
00:56:02,942 --> 00:56:06,237
-Hello?
-Hi, did you not get my text?

913
00:56:06,529 --> 00:56:09,115
Your husband is seeing another woman...

914
00:56:09,199 --> 00:56:11,785
Hey, who are you?
What is this nonsense about...

915
00:56:39,479 --> 00:56:42,232
Princess, we're home. You go in first.

916
00:56:42,690 --> 00:56:43,733
What about you, Mom?

917
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:46,152
I'll stop by Grandpa's place
for a few minutes.

918
00:56:58,289 --> 00:57:01,000
Sir, I'll fill up the bathtub
so that you can take a bath.

919
00:58:23,625 --> 00:58:24,501
A-jin!

920
00:58:27,545 --> 00:58:29,464
You said that you'd be home late today.

921
00:58:29,797 --> 00:58:31,341
What? It was...

922
00:58:32,091 --> 00:58:34,552
Mr. Yun proposed something
completely ridiculous,

923
00:58:34,928 --> 00:58:36,095
so I just cursed at him and left.

924
00:58:37,722 --> 00:58:39,265
By the way, why are you here?

925
00:58:40,016 --> 00:58:41,643
Let's go in. You'll find out.

926
00:58:45,188 --> 00:58:46,439
Everyone should watch this.

927
00:58:46,940 --> 00:58:47,774
What is it?

928
00:58:48,691 --> 00:58:49,984
JIN-HEE

929
00:58:59,827 --> 00:59:01,996
Father, there's something
I have to tell you.

930
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:03,831
I have something to tell you guys too.

931
00:59:04,582 --> 00:59:06,084
All of you are here,

932
00:59:07,293 --> 00:59:08,294
so this is perfect.

933
00:59:09,087 --> 00:59:10,755
Do you mind waiting upstairs with Ms. Jo?

934
00:59:10,838 --> 00:59:11,923
That's not necessary.

935
00:59:13,633 --> 00:59:14,467
I...

936
00:59:16,928 --> 00:59:18,513
have decided to marry her.

937
00:59:21,182 --> 00:59:22,016
Dad.

938
00:59:49,627 --> 00:59:51,879
They say that you never know
what tomorrow may bring.

939
00:59:51,963 --> 00:59:53,715
What if she marries
the chairman of Daesung Pulp?

940
00:59:53,798 --> 00:59:55,758
Are you saying she'll be my mother-in-law?

941
00:59:55,842 --> 00:59:59,387
If you don't want to be misunderstood,
tell him that you won't marry him.

942
00:59:59,470 --> 01:00:01,764
I want to have your baby.

943
01:00:02,432 --> 01:00:05,810
She got pregnant against her will.
It was clearly a case of rape.

944
01:00:06,352 --> 01:00:09,188
Every woman thinks that her husband
would never cheat on her.

945
01:00:09,272 --> 01:00:11,232
Is your husband doing all right?

946
01:00:11,316 --> 01:00:12,358
What about your husband?

947
01:00:12,442 --> 01:00:14,193
Just give up. Those two will get married.

948
01:00:14,360 --> 01:00:16,404
-What?
-Not me. I'm talking about Dad.

949
01:00:16,487 --> 01:00:18,406
He hasn't been cycling every morning.

950
01:00:18,615 --> 01:00:19,949
Keep a watchful eye on him.

951
01:00:20,033 --> 01:00:21,534
Ms. Woo is here now!

952
01:00:21,701 --> 01:00:23,286
Hide. Go under the sofa.

953
01:00:23,369 --> 01:00:24,454
Dad, are you cheating on Mom?

954
01:00:24,537 --> 01:00:27,915
I will not forgive anyone
who breaks Mom's heart.

955
01:00:29,375 --> 01:00:30,460
Is it you, Jeong-a?

956
01:00:31,002 --> 01:00:32,045
Cho-hui!

957
01:00:32,128 --> 01:00:34,964
I tried to find you.

958
01:00:35,548 --> 01:00:37,759
I saw someone lurking around our house.

959
01:00:37,842 --> 01:00:40,470
It was the man
from the video sent by A-jin.

960
01:00:40,553 --> 01:00:42,180
Get rid of that phone right away.

961
01:00:42,263 --> 01:00:44,140
Use your brain, you punk.

962
01:00:44,265 --> 01:00:47,268
If there are records that we spoke
on the phone, we'll be screwed.

963
01:00:48,144 --> 01:00:50,229
I found out who that man in the video is.

964
01:00:50,313 --> 01:00:52,315
