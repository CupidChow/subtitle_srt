1
00:00:51,301 --> 00:00:52,427
You're back.

2
00:00:52,552 --> 00:00:54,220
What's with the cat?

3
00:00:55,138 --> 00:00:57,640
What do you think? It's a cat.

4
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:00,185
Isn't my cat so cute?

5
00:01:00,727 --> 00:01:03,313
Who told you that you can have a cat
in our house?

6
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:07,317
I didn't buy this cat.
Mr. Chairman bought it for me.

7
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:36,846
What is this cat doing here?

8
00:01:39,224 --> 00:01:40,058
Answer me!

9
00:01:42,018 --> 00:01:43,728
I asked you what this cat is doing here!

10
00:01:48,441 --> 00:01:52,195
Mr. Chairman gave it to me.

11
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:54,280
I had no choice but to take it.

12
00:01:54,989 --> 00:01:56,157
Father gave this to you?

13
00:01:57,325 --> 00:01:58,201
Yes.

14
00:01:58,868 --> 00:02:01,621
Father knows that she has cat allergies.

15
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:02,956
That can't be true.

16
00:02:03,706 --> 00:02:05,667
What do you mean, Ms. Woo?

17
00:02:05,875 --> 00:02:09,420
You would know that I wouldn't tell
such a lie about Mr. Chairman.

18
00:02:12,215 --> 00:02:15,593
You should have discussed with us first.

19
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:18,847
Having a pet is like having
a new family member.

20
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:21,724
You shouldn't make rash decisions
like that.

21
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:24,185
There was no time for discussion.

22
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:26,521
Mr. Chairman gave it to me.

23
00:02:27,438 --> 00:02:29,232
I wasn't in the position to refuse.

24
00:02:29,315 --> 00:02:32,360
Are you planning on taking the cat
when you leave this house?

25
00:02:34,779 --> 00:02:35,780
I guess so.

26
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:38,658
Very well, then.

27
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:41,786
Please don't let the cat downstairs.

28
00:02:47,292 --> 00:02:48,293
Okay.

29
00:02:57,802 --> 00:02:58,845
Let's get up.

30
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:27,373
I despise cats.

31
00:03:27,624 --> 00:03:28,917
Especially that one!

32
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,878
Just for a few days. She says
she's going to take it with her.

33
00:03:32,128 --> 00:03:34,505
What is that supposed to mean?

34
00:03:34,756 --> 00:03:35,757
I will make her leave.

35
00:03:36,424 --> 00:03:38,927
I was going to tell you before,

36
00:03:39,344 --> 00:03:40,470
but I didn't have the chance.

37
00:03:41,179 --> 00:03:42,805
She's going to leave by herself?

38
00:03:44,307 --> 00:03:45,516
No way.

39
00:03:45,808 --> 00:03:47,518
There's a reason for her to leave.

40
00:03:48,311 --> 00:03:49,187
What is it?

41
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:51,356
Forget about it.

42
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:53,149
Don't worry or you'll get a headache.

43
00:03:53,316 --> 00:03:54,317
I'll take care of it.

44
00:03:55,193 --> 00:03:57,654
I have some herbal medicine for Un-gyu.

45
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:00,657
I bought it from an herbal clinic
recommended by a friend.

46
00:04:00,865 --> 00:04:03,284
This herbal medicine will help him
with his college entrance exams.

47
00:04:03,701 --> 00:04:04,869
Aren't you going to tell me?

48
00:04:05,119 --> 00:04:06,746
No prescription is needed
for the medicine.

49
00:04:07,705 --> 00:04:10,792
Just take care of Un-gyu.
The only thing you should worry about

50
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:12,293
is Un-gyu's college education.

51
00:04:12,835 --> 00:04:15,296
She'll really leave, right?
I hope you're sure about it.

52
00:04:15,463 --> 00:04:16,381
Yes.

53
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:19,425
She said that she'll leave
after making a birthday meal for Father.

54
00:04:19,717 --> 00:04:22,887
I forgot that his birthday is coming soon.

55
00:04:23,471 --> 00:04:25,014
So, just hang in there for a few days.

56
00:04:25,974 --> 00:04:29,352
She makes me uncomfortable
in my own house! That woman...

57
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:32,522
Father

58
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:35,566
took care of her debts.

59
00:04:36,734 --> 00:04:37,694
What?

60
00:04:55,378 --> 00:04:56,421
I'm going out.

61
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:59,173
Yes, ma'am. Take care.

62
00:05:06,681 --> 00:05:07,765
You!

63
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:12,979
I don't want to see the cat,
even in the few days that you're here.

64
00:05:15,064 --> 00:05:16,899
I heard that he took care of your debts.

65
00:05:18,776 --> 00:05:21,279
Since you're leaving soon after
his birthday,

66
00:05:22,196 --> 00:05:23,489
I won't say much.

67
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,328
Stop being

68
00:05:30,455 --> 00:05:31,831
so desperate.

69
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:30,098
It's late, you can leave now.

70
00:06:31,849 --> 00:06:34,060
The house wasn't properly taken care of
while I was away.

71
00:06:34,143 --> 00:06:35,686
There's dust everywhere.

72
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:38,356
-Do it tomorrow.
-I should've taken my daughter

73
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:41,526
to a clinic instead of taking care of
her myself. I missed out on the fun.

74
00:06:42,568 --> 00:06:44,237
Ms. Jo told me

75
00:06:44,654 --> 00:06:46,614
that the new maid is such a nuisance.

76
00:06:46,781 --> 00:06:49,075
I want to see what she looks like.

77
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:52,120
-Is she at home?
-This isn't the right time.

78
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:53,287
Go home.

79
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,750
All right, then. I'll clean
the bathroom tomorrow.

80
00:06:57,834 --> 00:06:58,918
Okay.

81
00:06:59,627 --> 00:07:00,586
Wait.

82
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:06,050
-What is this?
-Clothes for your grandchildren.

83
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:07,385
Two of each, since they are twins.

84
00:07:07,802 --> 00:07:09,804
Goodness. How kind of you.

85
00:07:10,138 --> 00:07:12,682
You are so kind to me.

86
00:07:12,765 --> 00:07:14,767
Nothing too expensive.
Tell her to not be overwhelmed.

87
00:07:14,892 --> 00:07:17,019
I'll make sure of that.
I'll be here early tomorrow.

88
00:07:17,145 --> 00:07:18,187
Bye.

89
00:07:25,486 --> 00:07:27,196
Why a cat all of a sudden?

90
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:37,582
You're so talented, Ji-hu.

91
00:07:37,874 --> 00:07:40,084
-Should we call it a day?
-Okay.

92
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:43,796
Your father is waiting outside.
While I go tell him,

93
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:47,467
let's put more detail on those fingertips.

94
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:49,135
-Go on.
-Okay.

95
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:57,768
Did you make it yourself?

96
00:07:58,227 --> 00:07:59,979
-Did you?
-There some on your face.

97
00:08:00,062 --> 00:08:00,980
Where?

98
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:04,442
-Are you okay?
-This is not me winking.

99
00:08:05,193 --> 00:08:06,819
It's because I was poked in the eye.

100
00:08:07,236 --> 00:08:08,571
I'm not winking.

101
00:08:08,654 --> 00:08:11,157
-Stop it.
-Really.

102
00:08:22,793 --> 00:08:24,045
Ji-hu, let's go home!

103
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:26,130
Bathroom.

104
00:08:26,964 --> 00:08:28,007
Go on.

105
00:08:33,638 --> 00:08:36,349
Ji-hu, are you listening to music alone?

106
00:08:36,974 --> 00:08:38,643
Let's listen to it together.

107
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:42,146
You listen to your own music,
I'll listen to mine.

108
00:08:43,105 --> 00:08:45,566
Let's not fight over such simple matters.

109
00:08:47,568 --> 00:08:49,237
She's hard to take care of.

110
00:08:51,906 --> 00:08:53,991
It's hard to take care of my own daughter.

111
00:08:57,453 --> 00:09:00,248
-Go on.
-Goodness.

112
00:09:01,999 --> 00:09:05,002
Mom. I'm so tired today.

113
00:09:05,294 --> 00:09:06,796
I want to skip writing my English diary.

114
00:09:07,088 --> 00:09:10,633
Okay then. Just write,
"today was another day" and go to sleep.

115
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:13,719
-Goodnight, mom and dad.
-Okay.

116
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:17,306
I'm so tired, too. I'm going to sleep.

117
00:09:18,724 --> 00:09:20,518
-Wash first.
-Sure.

118
00:09:20,768 --> 00:09:22,687
-Okay?
-Okay.

119
00:10:12,987 --> 00:10:16,616
Danger lies to those who have secrets.

120
00:10:31,005 --> 00:10:33,132
-Who is it?
-It's me.

121
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:40,681
What brings you here?

122
00:10:41,098 --> 00:10:43,184
May I come in and talk to you?

123
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:55,863
Sit.

124
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,243
I came here to get some sleep.
What brings you here?

125
00:11:01,744 --> 00:11:03,746
Your husband hired me as
a full-time employee.

126
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:05,623
Thank you.

127
00:11:06,415 --> 00:11:09,710
Good for you. Did you come here
to say thank you?

128
00:11:10,753 --> 00:11:12,254
I will keep an eye out for you.

129
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:15,299
You can bring your boyfriend here.
No one will know about it.

130
00:11:16,592 --> 00:11:18,344
You're a funny guy.

131
00:11:19,428 --> 00:11:21,013
What the hell are you doing here?

132
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:22,556
I felt uncomfortable.

133
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:26,143
I burdened you with my poor family
and my younger brothers.

134
00:11:26,811 --> 00:11:28,187
I need to give something in return.

135
00:11:28,604 --> 00:11:30,064
I will repay you with my service.

136
00:11:30,147 --> 00:11:31,482
What a joke.

137
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,984
Don't ever show your face again.

138
00:11:34,068 --> 00:11:36,278
I have records of him entering the hotel.

139
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:38,239
I have his cell phone number, too.

140
00:11:39,323 --> 00:11:40,950
How dare you.

141
00:11:41,617 --> 00:11:44,078
What are you trying to accomplish?
Do you want your life to end?

142
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:46,205
Don't be mistaken.

143
00:11:46,414 --> 00:11:48,958
I just wanted to say that
it doesn't matter whether or not

144
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:50,584
if you meet him.

145
00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:54,213
You have no decency.

146
00:11:54,713 --> 00:11:56,924
You should know your place in this world.

147
00:11:57,007 --> 00:11:58,050
Ma'am,

148
00:11:58,384 --> 00:12:01,429
I shall never be a burden to you again.

149
00:12:02,179 --> 00:12:05,641
I will work hard as an employee.

150
00:12:06,016 --> 00:12:08,519
After all you have done?

151
00:12:10,187 --> 00:12:13,065
Anyways, I don't want

152
00:12:14,191 --> 00:12:16,152
to see you ever again.

153
00:12:17,194 --> 00:12:18,279
Get out!

154
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:53,898
Your husband is seeing another woman.

155
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:08,370
Take a look at this.

156
00:13:09,872 --> 00:13:11,749
What kind of a person would send
such a thing?

157
00:13:12,124 --> 00:13:14,919
This isn't even a scam.
What do you make of this?

158
00:13:15,961 --> 00:13:17,046
I have no idea.

159
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:20,883
Weird.

160
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:30,434
How do I wash this? Let's see.

161
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:34,522
It says that I can put this
in the washing machine.

162
00:13:37,024 --> 00:13:39,568
Clothes these days have good quality.
They don't even smell.

163
00:13:44,823 --> 00:13:48,953
Like clothes hidden in bubbles,
secrets that appear hidden

164
00:13:50,037 --> 00:13:53,874
will be uncovered eventually.

165
00:14:02,216 --> 00:14:04,426
We've become so close with the cat,

166
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:07,012
how are we supposed to say goodbye?

167
00:14:07,429 --> 00:14:09,223
It hurts my feelings.

168
00:14:09,431 --> 00:14:10,558
The cat isn't going anywhere.

169
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:13,936
Ms. Park hates cats,

170
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:16,313
so she wants me to get rid of it.

171
00:14:16,397 --> 00:14:18,524
Who is she to say so?

172
00:14:19,316 --> 00:14:22,319
A cat is no object. Nonsense.

173
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:32,580
-Hello.
-Hello.

174
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:35,499
I sent you all a message through
the group chat. Did you all get it?

175
00:14:35,624 --> 00:14:38,127
-Yes.
-Today's topic is "good memories."

176
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:40,629
Think of one good memory
that you have in your life,

177
00:14:41,005 --> 00:14:43,549
share it with the group
and show support to others,

178
00:14:43,924 --> 00:14:47,344
so that it could be repeated again.

179
00:14:47,428 --> 00:14:49,096
Have you all brought your
"good memory objects"?

180
00:14:49,179 --> 00:14:50,055
Yes.

181
00:14:50,514 --> 00:14:51,599
Who should we start with?

182
00:14:53,434 --> 00:14:54,602
Let's start with the newcomer.

183
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:56,228
Good idea.

184
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:01,942
-I love you.
-I love you.

185
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,531
I had a wife.

186
00:15:09,033 --> 00:15:12,328
I met her in freshman year of college,
and we loved each other with passion.

187
00:15:13,621 --> 00:15:15,247
When I first saw her,

188
00:15:15,623 --> 00:15:18,083
she was wearing mittens.

189
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:22,421
When she took them off,
I could see that her hands were so small.

190
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:26,926
So, I asked her, "Why are your
hands so small?" Then she replied,

191
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:28,302
"Why do you care?"

192
00:15:30,888 --> 00:15:32,014
That's how she replied.

193
00:15:34,975 --> 00:15:38,520
Even today, whenever I see those mittens,

194
00:15:39,563 --> 00:15:41,023
I think of my wife.

195
00:15:42,733 --> 00:15:44,610
-I love you.
-I love you.

196
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:46,987
Next up, A-jin.

197
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:51,033
I love you all.

198
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:52,743
I love you.

199
00:15:55,871 --> 00:15:58,791
My dad died when I was eight.

200
00:16:00,334 --> 00:16:03,379
I have two memories of my dad.

201
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:07,633
When I went to the men's sauna
with my dad at age four,

202
00:16:09,218 --> 00:16:11,095
and memories of paper birds.

203
00:16:13,555 --> 00:16:14,807
My dad taught me

204
00:16:15,432 --> 00:16:17,726
how to make paper birds.

205
00:16:19,603 --> 00:16:22,439
As a seven-year-old,
it was difficult for me.

206
00:16:24,274 --> 00:16:27,319
I kept on making mistakes

207
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:29,697
so I couldn't make one correctly.

208
00:16:31,407 --> 00:16:34,118
Then I finally managed to make one.

209
00:16:35,452 --> 00:16:36,662
Then my dad said,

210
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,456
"Do you want to see your paper bird

211
00:16:40,082 --> 00:16:42,501
turn into a real one?"

212
00:16:43,961 --> 00:16:44,962
He said that.

213
00:16:47,423 --> 00:16:48,507
But...

214
00:16:50,801 --> 00:16:52,177
I still

215
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:55,431
remember how I felt

216
00:16:56,473 --> 00:16:57,850
after I heard him say that.

217
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:05,274
I believed

218
00:17:06,275 --> 00:17:07,401
that my dad

219
00:17:08,402 --> 00:17:09,486
could really

220
00:17:10,571 --> 00:17:13,323
turn it into a real bird for me.

221
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:18,454
To me, he was a father
who could do anything for me.

222
00:17:21,999 --> 00:17:24,376
Whenever I see paper birds,
I think of my dad.

223
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:29,006
I feel like it may actually fly.

224
00:17:29,965 --> 00:17:30,924
That's how I feel.

225
00:17:35,012 --> 00:17:36,513
I love you.

226
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:54,698
What on earth are you doing?

227
00:17:56,617 --> 00:17:58,702
What? Fitness club?

228
00:18:00,537 --> 00:18:03,540
Now that you're well off,
you forget who's important.

229
00:18:03,624 --> 00:18:05,375
Shut your mouth.

230
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:08,879
How dare you accuse me
of being a gold digger.

231
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:12,925
Don't you remember who saved you
from those desperate situations?

232
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:14,301
We went over that already.

233
00:18:14,384 --> 00:18:15,803
You went to jail for me.

234
00:18:17,054 --> 00:18:19,473
That's why I'm trying to return the favor.

235
00:18:19,556 --> 00:18:22,643
Then return the favor,

236
00:18:22,726 --> 00:18:24,144
and stop asking for one.

237
00:18:25,646 --> 00:18:27,731
How much trouble can it be for you
to afford a health club?

238
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:31,026
Ms. Woo knows that I have been to prison.

239
00:18:33,654 --> 00:18:34,696
How did she know?

240
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:38,700
Anyways, shut your mouth

241
00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:41,703
and stay low. Okay?

242
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:49,002
It's delicious.

243
00:18:49,503 --> 00:18:51,338
How come you can cook and
be pretty at the same time?

244
00:18:51,463 --> 00:18:52,506
Right?

245
00:19:00,222 --> 00:19:02,683
-Want a bite?
-I have a trauma involving kimbap.

246
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:04,768
Traumas should be overcome.

247
00:19:04,852 --> 00:19:06,395
You are prettier without makeup.

248
00:19:09,231 --> 00:19:12,276
I hope you would stop having
any feelings for me.

249
00:19:12,442 --> 00:19:13,527
I'll try.

250
00:19:18,574 --> 00:19:20,200
I like trees.

251
00:19:21,368 --> 00:19:24,580
They don't move an inch,
even in rains and storms.

252
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:26,331
Not moving an inch is a good thing?

253
00:19:26,582 --> 00:19:29,251
Of course. I don't like things
that change.

254
00:19:29,459 --> 00:19:32,171
That's why I like trees.
They're always at the same spot.

255
00:19:32,629 --> 00:19:33,922
I like flowers.

256
00:19:34,214 --> 00:19:35,716
-Why?
-They're pretty.

257
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:39,595
They have a nice smell
and they look pretty.

258
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:41,889
Just looking at them makes me happy.

259
00:19:43,265 --> 00:19:46,518
"Smell" is a bad choice of words.
"Scent" is a better word.

260
00:19:46,643 --> 00:19:47,686
Anyways,

261
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:49,980
I like how flowers change.

262
00:19:50,898 --> 00:19:53,942
First, they start out as seeds
then grow into fruits and leaves,

263
00:19:54,484 --> 00:19:57,279
they bloom and they fade.

264
00:19:57,696 --> 00:19:59,615
But the scent stays the same.

265
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:07,497
Look at the sky. The sky seems higher
than usual,

266
00:20:07,664 --> 00:20:09,416
-don't you think?
-You can have it.

267
00:20:10,667 --> 00:20:12,794
Just that part, from there to there.

268
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:15,297
I'll take it out and give it to you.

269
00:20:15,756 --> 00:20:17,925
The entire sky is mine, actually.

270
00:20:19,635 --> 00:20:21,303
I'll sell it to you
piece by piece for free.

271
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:22,888
Your jokes are lame.

272
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:28,727
Aren't you giving me any fees?

273
00:20:29,811 --> 00:20:31,813
-What fees?
-Sales commission.

274
00:20:32,189 --> 00:20:34,191
I told you that the sky is mine.

275
00:20:36,318 --> 00:20:37,319
Gosh.

276
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:41,740
Kimbap, open.

277
00:20:43,533 --> 00:20:44,576
Open.

278
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:47,579
What?

279
00:20:57,798 --> 00:21:00,050
Are you serious? Goodness.

280
00:21:00,175 --> 00:21:02,678
Just act like you know nothing.
Don't meddle in their affairs.

281
00:21:03,178 --> 00:21:04,596
I won't meddle.

282
00:21:05,222 --> 00:21:07,766
I can't believe that woman spoke
so highly of herself in front of me.

283
00:21:09,393 --> 00:21:12,562
She's an interesting person,
asking such a favor.

284
00:21:13,188 --> 00:21:15,065
She has no boundaries regarding
human relationships.

285
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:20,362
Men will cheat no matter
how pretty their wives are.

286
00:21:21,071 --> 00:21:24,366
I made a reservation for lunch,
the day after tomorrow.

287
00:21:25,075 --> 00:21:26,076
Yes.

288
00:21:29,037 --> 00:21:32,624
If he lays a hand on you once again,
I won't let him get away with it!

289
00:21:34,334 --> 00:21:35,377
Seong-su,

290
00:21:37,212 --> 00:21:38,130
thank you.

291
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:42,843
That bastard. He should give you
more financial support.

292
00:22:09,369 --> 00:22:10,370
Sir.

293
00:22:11,913 --> 00:22:12,789
Sir.

294
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:14,666
Mr. Ahn!

295
00:22:17,544 --> 00:22:20,088
-Why?
-You must have been overworking yourself.

296
00:22:23,842 --> 00:22:25,177
You should sleep at home.

297
00:22:26,053 --> 00:22:27,137
Which home?

298
00:22:40,067 --> 00:22:42,819
Honey, get up. You need to work out.

299
00:22:44,988 --> 00:22:46,448
Come on, get up.

300
00:22:46,531 --> 00:22:48,450
Stop it!

301
00:22:59,628 --> 00:23:01,421
Get up! There you go.

302
00:23:02,339 --> 00:23:04,883
I don't feel like it.
Let me get a day off.

303
00:23:05,133 --> 00:23:06,635
I'll work out twice as hard tomorrow.

304
00:23:06,718 --> 00:23:07,969
Come on, drink.

305
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:10,597
Are you going to keep on acting
like a baby?

306
00:23:10,722 --> 00:23:12,307
-Wait.
-Come on, hurry.

307
00:23:16,603 --> 00:23:17,646
Go on.

308
00:23:18,355 --> 00:23:19,648
So cute!

309
00:23:20,857 --> 00:23:21,900
Just once!

310
00:23:22,984 --> 00:23:24,027
Have fun!

311
00:24:07,779 --> 00:24:10,031
Mr. Chairman doesn't like
the insides of abalones,

312
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:11,783
because it tastes fishy.

313
00:24:12,492 --> 00:24:14,786
He will learn to like it from now.

314
00:24:49,529 --> 00:24:54,242
Mr. Chairman, I'll dye your hair for you.

315
00:24:54,743 --> 00:24:56,286
For what?

316
00:24:57,412 --> 00:24:58,914
It'll soon turn white again.

317
00:24:58,997 --> 00:25:00,999
You need to look younger.

318
00:25:01,583 --> 00:25:04,544
You're a man, Mr. Chairman.

319
00:25:06,504 --> 00:25:07,422
All right.

320
00:25:08,757 --> 00:25:09,674
Okay.

321
00:25:20,435 --> 00:25:21,478
Ms. Jo?

322
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:28,151
Ms. Jo?

323
00:25:39,829 --> 00:25:40,789
Ms. Jo?

324
00:26:10,777 --> 00:26:12,529
The strange thing is that,

325
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:15,615
she speaks standard language
when she's alone with me

326
00:26:15,949 --> 00:26:19,452
but she speaks a dialect
when she's with Mr. Chairman.

327
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:22,497
And ma'am,

328
00:26:23,248 --> 00:26:27,085
I discovered something while
I was cleaning her room.

329
00:26:28,128 --> 00:26:31,298
She threatened me

330
00:26:31,923 --> 00:26:34,301
never to tell anyone about it.

331
00:26:36,136 --> 00:26:38,054
I saw documents with information
on Mr. Chairman

332
00:26:38,138 --> 00:26:40,140
and the family members.

333
00:26:42,309 --> 00:26:44,686
Tell me more. Documents?

334
00:26:44,769 --> 00:26:46,354
I didn't get a good look at it.

335
00:26:46,855 --> 00:26:50,191
It had information about
the size of Mr. Chairman's company.

336
00:26:51,109 --> 00:26:53,236
Mostly about his personal wealth.

337
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:56,698
In my humble opinion,

338
00:26:57,615 --> 00:27:00,160
I don't think it was coincidence

339
00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:02,829
that led her to Mr. Chairman.

340
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:09,169
Understood. You can leave now.

341
00:27:12,297 --> 00:27:15,383
Take this to Pung-suk's Kitchen.
It's a food list for my father's birthday.

342
00:27:15,925 --> 00:27:18,720
What you told me today,

343
00:27:19,179 --> 00:27:21,014
must be kept as a secret.

344
00:27:21,097 --> 00:27:23,224
Yes, ma'am. Of course.

345
00:27:23,308 --> 00:27:26,144
So, you're telling me that
she went there with a clear purpose.

346
00:27:26,227 --> 00:27:28,813
Of course. Why else
would she gather such information?

347
00:27:29,939 --> 00:27:31,900
Ms. Woo must be in a tight spot.

348
00:27:31,983 --> 00:27:35,695
But she doesn't stand a chance
against Ms. Woo.

349
00:27:35,987 --> 00:27:39,699
-Why is that?
-Ms. Woo is a powerful woman.

350
00:27:39,824 --> 00:27:42,285
She's indeed well known for her
kindness and education.

351
00:27:42,494 --> 00:27:44,371
Indeed. Actually,

352
00:27:44,788 --> 00:27:47,165
the one who has real control
over Mr. Chairman

353
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:48,792
is Ms. Woo.

354
00:27:49,125 --> 00:27:51,419
Doesn't matter.
She's just a daughter-in-law.

355
00:27:51,628 --> 00:27:55,131
I think Mr. Chairman is already
all over Bok-ja Park's bosom.

356
00:27:58,301 --> 00:28:02,180
You don't know how powerful Ms. Woo is.

357
00:28:06,226 --> 00:28:07,310
Is that true?

358
00:28:07,644 --> 00:28:08,645
Yes, Father.

359
00:28:09,145 --> 00:28:11,648
I should have vetted her.

360
00:28:12,649 --> 00:28:13,608
It was my fault.

361
00:28:16,111 --> 00:28:17,153
That can't be.

362
00:28:17,362 --> 00:28:19,781
I'll make sure she leaves
right after your birthday tomorrow.

363
00:28:24,828 --> 00:28:26,037
I have something to ask you.

364
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:29,833
Why did you pay off her debts?

365
00:28:31,668 --> 00:28:35,046
Do you think of her
as more than a caregiver?

366
00:28:35,422 --> 00:28:37,215
Why do you care about
how I spend my own money?

367
00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:39,300
That's not what I'm trying to say.

368
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:42,053
Get out. I'm tired of this.

369
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:48,435
Get some rest.

370
00:29:14,711 --> 00:29:15,920
Get out.

371
00:29:25,388 --> 00:29:26,723
Did you tell her?

372
00:29:27,348 --> 00:29:28,266
Does she know?

373
00:29:29,142 --> 00:29:30,059
To some extent.

374
00:29:30,393 --> 00:29:32,312
I have yet to tell her
that I'm going to fire her.

375
00:29:34,397 --> 00:29:37,358
If she realizes what's going on,
she'll want to get rid of her.

376
00:29:39,402 --> 00:29:40,403
Probably.

377
00:29:41,988 --> 00:29:44,657
-She lives in Jeju Island?
-Who? Un-gyu's parents?

378
00:29:44,783 --> 00:29:45,700
Yes.

379
00:29:46,659 --> 00:29:49,996
Do you know anything about
Mr. Chairman's oldest son, Un-gyu's dad?

380
00:29:50,121 --> 00:29:54,209
He cut ties with Mr. Chairman
and was forced to go to the United States.

381
00:29:55,251 --> 00:29:56,252
Why did he cut ties?

382
00:29:56,336 --> 00:29:57,545
I don't know well...

383
00:29:58,338 --> 00:30:00,215
Don't you know more than I do?

384
00:30:00,423 --> 00:30:02,425
After all, you did all the research.

385
00:30:05,011 --> 00:30:06,554
I heard you're going to leave.

386
00:30:07,555 --> 00:30:10,850
I heard that you're going to leave
after Mr. Chairman's birthday.

387
00:30:13,228 --> 00:30:16,564
Since I'm leaving this place
against my will,

388
00:30:16,773 --> 00:30:18,775
do you feel you have the right
to look down on me?

389
00:30:18,858 --> 00:30:21,986
Gosh, no. Don't be mistaken.

390
00:30:22,445 --> 00:30:25,865
We're both in the same situation,
working for people...

391
00:30:25,949 --> 00:30:27,116
Shut your mouth.

392
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:33,206
That's why you'll never succeed in life.

393
00:30:34,332 --> 00:30:37,502
Why, how rude!

394
00:30:37,585 --> 00:30:40,797
Leeching off other people,

395
00:30:41,089 --> 00:30:43,132
like a parasite.

396
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,093
What did you say?

397
00:30:45,969 --> 00:30:48,263
I had enough of this...

398
00:30:48,346 --> 00:30:49,597
You should get a hold of yourself,

399
00:30:50,223 --> 00:30:52,433
or else you'll be the one walking
out of this place.

400
00:30:52,767 --> 00:30:55,270
Your only son made a mistake
that resulted in you being in debt.

401
00:30:55,353 --> 00:30:59,357
Your daughter has kidney problems,
so she needs to be on kidney dialysis.

402
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:00,608
Don't you need money?

403
00:31:02,277 --> 00:31:05,321
You know that I did background checks

404
00:31:05,697 --> 00:31:07,031
on people in this house.

405
00:31:11,244 --> 00:31:12,245
I will never

406
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:17,208
leave this house.

407
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:20,253
So, don't ever look down on me.

408
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:32,390
You have gotten prettier.

409
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,435
You look like you had a hard time.

410
00:31:35,643 --> 00:31:37,020
Welcome, Jae-hui.

411
00:31:37,562 --> 00:31:40,189
I was going to greet you at the airport,
but you wouldn't let me.

412
00:31:40,315 --> 00:31:42,066
No worries. I had no luggage.

413
00:31:44,152 --> 00:31:47,071
-Where's your husband?
-He acquired a new company.

414
00:31:47,322 --> 00:31:49,365
He has a lot of work to do,
so I came alone.

415
00:31:49,490 --> 00:31:51,326
I wish he had come.
I haven't seen him for a while.

416
00:31:51,534 --> 00:31:53,745
That's true. Where's dad?

417
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:56,289
He's taking a walk with Mr. Kim.
He'll be here soon.

418
00:31:56,497 --> 00:31:59,542
Leaving both of you to take
care of my sick father...

419
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:02,462
-You must think I'm a bit rude.
-Not at all.

420
00:32:03,338 --> 00:32:05,506
Where's the infamous caregiver?

421
00:32:05,882 --> 00:32:06,966
Let me take a look at her.

422
00:32:09,427 --> 00:32:10,511
Hello, ma'am.

423
00:32:11,137 --> 00:32:12,513
Hello.

424
00:32:14,515 --> 00:32:16,809
You're not my dad's type.

425
00:32:18,186 --> 00:32:20,313
You should eat first.
You must be starving.

426
00:32:21,481 --> 00:32:23,274
Give up on whatever you're after.

427
00:32:24,484 --> 00:32:26,694
I'm the only one who can
ask my dad for support.

428
00:32:28,404 --> 00:32:29,572
Dad!

429
00:32:30,573 --> 00:32:31,616
Dad!

430
00:32:32,659 --> 00:32:35,078
-You're here.
-I had a hard time.

431
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:38,998
-Where's Jae-seok?
-He's very busy these days.

432
00:32:39,165 --> 00:32:42,168
He's working hard because of
a new product launch.

433
00:32:42,251 --> 00:32:43,544
He also exercises in the morning.

434
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:46,047
Still, he should say hi
to his only sister.

435
00:32:46,714 --> 00:32:49,008
He'll be home soon. My apologies.

436
00:32:49,717 --> 00:32:52,720
What are you apologizing for?
He's the one with the problem.

437
00:32:54,389 --> 00:32:56,265
What about my older brother?

438
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:00,019
Why didn't your husband come?

439
00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:04,148
His business is not going well.

440
00:33:05,191 --> 00:33:06,776
You should invest in his business.

441
00:33:07,235 --> 00:33:09,320
Don't start a business
if you're going to ask for my help.

442
00:33:09,487 --> 00:33:10,321
Okay.

443
00:33:11,072 --> 00:33:13,074
Let's talk about this after your birthday.

444
00:33:14,283 --> 00:33:15,618
It's not that I'm asking for a lot.

445
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:17,745
Two million won would be nice.

446
00:33:18,329 --> 00:33:20,623
Kimchi. I was craving for kimchi.

447
00:33:23,751 --> 00:33:24,752
Delicious.

448
00:33:52,113 --> 00:33:53,197
Ta-da!

449
00:33:58,995 --> 00:34:00,747
I can't come tomorrow
because of my dad's birthday.

450
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:02,206
We talked about this already.

451
00:34:05,001 --> 00:34:06,711
Mr. Chairman, it's time
to take your medicine.

452
00:34:24,103 --> 00:34:26,147
Do you want to go for a morning walk?

453
00:34:26,647 --> 00:34:29,150
-I can take you.
-No. I need to go to work.

454
00:34:29,817 --> 00:34:33,154
I thought you were going
stay inside for a week.

455
00:34:34,197 --> 00:34:35,364
Did you change your mind?

456
00:34:35,490 --> 00:34:36,324
Leave me.

457
00:35:23,913 --> 00:35:25,164
Dad!

458
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:28,042
Let's see if my dad is still sleeping.

459
00:35:29,502 --> 00:35:31,712
Father went to work
because of a board meeting.

460
00:35:32,088 --> 00:35:34,382
Gosh. You should have woken me up.

461
00:35:34,465 --> 00:35:36,050
You were in such a deep sleep.

462
00:35:36,175 --> 00:35:38,553
I need my dad to like me.

463
00:35:43,641 --> 00:35:45,893
-Hey.
-Yes?

464
00:35:46,185 --> 00:35:48,938
Fix a meal for me.
Let me see how well you cook.

465
00:35:49,897 --> 00:35:51,566
I'm a caregiver.

466
00:35:51,649 --> 00:35:52,692
So, what?

467
00:35:54,652 --> 00:35:55,611
I'm not a person

468
00:35:56,487 --> 00:35:59,115
who does chores around this house.

469
00:36:00,867 --> 00:36:02,994
You follow such strict rules.

470
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:06,706
I want to see what kind of food

471
00:36:06,789 --> 00:36:08,583
you serve to my father.

472
00:36:10,001 --> 00:36:12,753
What should I do, Ms. Woo? Do I do it?

473
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:15,131
No, don't.

474
00:36:15,214 --> 00:36:18,634
-A-jin.
-Jae-hui, I'll prepare breakfast for you.

475
00:36:18,843 --> 00:36:20,511
This woman is fired.

476
00:36:21,804 --> 00:36:23,890
She's still here because
of our father's birthday.

477
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:26,475
It's not her duty to prepare food.

478
00:36:27,143 --> 00:36:28,352
She has no right to do so either.

479
00:36:28,769 --> 00:36:30,771
Come in. I'll prepare food.

480
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:35,276
Right?

481
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:56,672
Mr. Chairman, wear this.

482
00:37:08,768 --> 00:37:11,479
Life is a series of choices.

483
00:37:15,399 --> 00:37:16,525
One needs to make choices

484
00:37:17,068 --> 00:37:19,570
on whether to accept or let go.

485
00:37:21,489 --> 00:37:24,617
One needs to make choices

486
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:26,160
to be chosen.

487
00:37:29,956 --> 00:37:30,957
This shirt

488
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,043
and this tie.

489
00:37:38,297 --> 00:37:40,341
Jae-seok Ahn, you're so handsome.

490
00:37:40,466 --> 00:37:42,426
Of course, I am.

491
00:37:42,843 --> 00:37:45,513
I'm the son of my beautiful mother.
I resemble her.

492
00:37:46,222 --> 00:37:48,724
Your sister is waiting for you.
Call her at least.

493
00:37:48,808 --> 00:37:52,353
I hate her so much. We always
fight within 30 minutes of talking.

494
00:37:53,271 --> 00:37:56,482
Oh, I heard that you had food
with a young girl at a café.

495
00:37:56,732 --> 00:37:57,900
I caught you red-handed!

496
00:37:58,567 --> 00:37:59,485
What?

497
00:38:00,027 --> 00:38:02,488
I heard you had food at a café
in Chungdam-dong. Who was it?

498
00:38:02,989 --> 00:38:04,323
It's probably a mistake.

499
00:38:04,407 --> 00:38:06,867
I'm really busy these days
because of the new product launch.

500
00:38:07,285 --> 00:38:09,537
Something smells fishy.
Someone told me you were at Take Two.

501
00:38:09,704 --> 00:38:11,247
That’s the café you normally go to, right.

502
00:38:12,498 --> 00:38:14,292
Oh, that girl.

503
00:38:14,959 --> 00:38:18,754
She's from
the female pad marketing department.

504
00:38:19,338 --> 00:38:20,881
I needed her advice.

505
00:38:21,716 --> 00:38:24,760
She had to make a decision.

506
00:38:26,262 --> 00:38:29,724
Well, I guess there's nothing wrong
about that.

507
00:38:29,932 --> 00:38:33,602
Her decision was to trust him.

508
00:38:35,813 --> 00:38:37,773
Work hard so that father likes you.

509
00:38:38,316 --> 00:38:39,358
Don't worry.

510
00:38:47,575 --> 00:38:48,701
Your handkerchief, honey!

511
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:52,496
We have started up the Chinese factories

512
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:54,665
for our new product launch,

513
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:57,001
and all product lines have been examined.

514
00:38:57,793 --> 00:38:59,879
We should stop using brightening agents,

515
00:38:59,962 --> 00:39:02,965
and increase the price of our products.

516
00:39:03,174 --> 00:39:06,594
If brightening agents become a problem,

517
00:39:06,677 --> 00:39:09,055
it may hurt our sanitary pad sales.
That's all.

518
00:39:10,431 --> 00:39:12,308
Okay. Do what you have to do.

519
00:39:13,309 --> 00:39:15,353
You can leave if there's nothing else
to discuss.

520
00:39:24,737 --> 00:39:25,863
You leave, too.

521
00:39:27,073 --> 00:39:28,616
Mr. Chairman...

522
00:39:29,450 --> 00:39:30,326
I mean, Dad.

523
00:39:31,035 --> 00:39:32,578
About that woman...

524
00:39:32,953 --> 00:39:34,413
I should meet her in person.

525
00:39:34,872 --> 00:39:36,707
-No need.
-Why?

526
00:39:37,833 --> 00:39:38,834
You're making her leave?

527
00:39:45,091 --> 00:39:46,342
I heard

528
00:39:47,843 --> 00:39:49,345
you slept together.

529
00:39:51,097 --> 00:39:53,974
A man shouldn't do that to a woman.

530
00:39:54,058 --> 00:39:56,060
-How rude...
-I'll come over today to say hi to her.

531
00:39:56,143 --> 00:39:57,603
I said there's no need.

532
00:39:57,686 --> 00:40:01,273
Why won't anyone let me say hi to her?

533
00:40:01,357 --> 00:40:03,692
It's not like we're Romeo and Juliet.

534
00:40:03,776 --> 00:40:05,903
Go away, get out.

535
00:40:07,863 --> 00:40:10,991
Why are you throwing this masterpiece?

536
00:40:11,283 --> 00:40:12,451
What's this?

537
00:40:12,535 --> 00:40:16,205
There should be noble art on this,
not some kind of a cartoon.

538
00:40:17,331 --> 00:40:20,918
Talk about your standards!
How do you call this a cartoon?

539
00:40:21,502 --> 00:40:24,588
It's by an artist who'll become
the greatest of pop art.

540
00:40:26,006 --> 00:40:27,675
Cartoon?

541
00:40:27,967 --> 00:40:29,009
Get out!

542
00:40:30,928 --> 00:40:31,971
Yes, sir.

543
00:40:34,849 --> 00:40:35,724
Goodbye.

544
00:40:38,561 --> 00:40:41,814
You should have let your teacher come.
Why do you insist on going?

545
00:40:42,148 --> 00:40:44,191
Your teacher said that
she'll come to teach.

546
00:40:44,817 --> 00:40:46,277
I have clear reasons.

547
00:40:46,902 --> 00:40:48,446
-What is it?
-First,

548
00:40:49,155 --> 00:40:52,825
I can hear more clearly
in the lesson room than at home.

549
00:40:53,284 --> 00:40:56,954
Second, I like talking to you in the car.

550
00:40:57,371 --> 00:41:00,666
I don't get the chance to see you
if she comes.

551
00:41:00,916 --> 00:41:03,127
Is that so?

552
00:41:03,419 --> 00:41:04,420
How cute!

553
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:07,423
As I was saying,

554
00:41:08,090 --> 00:41:10,468
I want you to pick me up
after my art class.

555
00:41:10,676 --> 00:41:13,095
-Not dad.
-Why?

556
00:41:13,637 --> 00:41:15,806
I told you. I like talking to you.

557
00:41:16,474 --> 00:41:19,894
You're not telling me that you like me
more than your dad, are you?

558
00:41:20,019 --> 00:41:21,937
Of course not.

559
00:41:22,813 --> 00:41:25,441
Anyways, I want you to come.
Don't let dad come.

560
00:41:25,816 --> 00:41:27,234
Dad wants to pick you up.

561
00:41:27,526 --> 00:41:30,571
I think he's using her art
for one of his products.

562
00:41:32,031 --> 00:41:33,949
Maybe he found an interest in art.

563
00:41:34,283 --> 00:41:36,243
Dad? Art?

564
00:41:36,869 --> 00:41:37,953
Yes.

565
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:49,173
You can teach in one of the three homes
month-by-month in a rotation.

566
00:41:56,055 --> 00:41:58,682
Wear the underwear
I bought for you tomorrow.

567
00:42:01,352 --> 00:42:04,188
Your husband is seeing another woman.

568
00:42:05,814 --> 00:42:07,816
Eight hundred is a fair deal,
don't you think?

569
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:11,570
That's once a week.

570
00:42:11,737 --> 00:42:14,698
I think we can just meet
over there from now on.

571
00:42:18,118 --> 00:42:18,953
LIST OF MENUS

572
00:42:19,036 --> 00:42:20,996
Hey, where are the lotus root pickles?

573
00:42:21,163 --> 00:42:22,331
In fridge number two.

574
00:42:22,581 --> 00:42:24,291
-Please hurry and pack that up.
-Yes, ma'am.

575
00:42:28,212 --> 00:42:30,297
-Almost done?
-Almost.

576
00:42:31,507 --> 00:42:34,385
-Delicious!
-Eating before Mr. Chairman. That's rude!

577
00:42:34,510 --> 00:42:37,054
She says she'll never leave.
Not over her dead body!

578
00:42:37,221 --> 00:42:39,848
Ms. Woo told her to leave.
How can she not?

579
00:42:39,932 --> 00:42:42,101
You don't know
what kind of a woman she is.

580
00:42:43,894 --> 00:42:44,979
What a disaster.

581
00:42:45,062 --> 00:42:48,148
Now let's all head to
Mr. Chairman's place!

582
00:43:04,164 --> 00:43:05,624
It's ready.

583
00:43:07,876 --> 00:43:08,794
Mr. Chairman,

584
00:43:10,045 --> 00:43:12,172
aren't you feeling happy
that your daughter is here?

585
00:43:15,301 --> 00:43:19,096
I told you that I'd dye your hair.

586
00:43:20,097 --> 00:43:22,391
-Let's do it now.
-No need.

587
00:43:22,474 --> 00:43:24,977
I'll do it for you. For your birthday.

588
00:43:25,185 --> 00:43:26,353
I said, no need.

589
00:43:28,355 --> 00:43:30,524
There's something I need to tell you, too.

590
00:43:35,696 --> 00:43:37,031
I had a daughter.

591
00:43:38,616 --> 00:43:40,367
I raised her by myself.

592
00:43:41,702 --> 00:43:43,746
But seven years ago,

593
00:43:45,039 --> 00:43:46,749
she developed leukemia.

594
00:43:48,709 --> 00:43:50,794
I needed 60 million won

595
00:43:51,670 --> 00:43:54,506
to pay for her bone marrow transplant.

596
00:43:57,051 --> 00:43:58,427
I didn't even have

597
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:01,388
600 thousand won.

598
00:44:02,765 --> 00:44:04,808
I had no choice.

599
00:44:08,187 --> 00:44:09,938
That's why I did it.

600
00:44:11,607 --> 00:44:14,318
I did what

601
00:44:15,861 --> 00:44:16,987
was forbidden.

602
00:44:18,197 --> 00:44:22,034
So, I ended up in prison.

603
00:44:23,744 --> 00:44:26,080
Why didn't you tell me this earlier?

604
00:44:27,373 --> 00:44:28,582
How can I possibly

605
00:44:30,417 --> 00:44:32,461
tell you such a thing?

606
00:44:39,134 --> 00:44:40,135
Mr. Chairman,

607
00:44:43,472 --> 00:44:44,890
stay healthy.

608
00:44:46,767 --> 00:44:49,103
I know that I'm leaving,

609
00:44:50,479 --> 00:44:53,607
but I'll pay you back my debts.

610
00:44:56,193 --> 00:44:59,363
You don't need to.

611
00:45:00,531 --> 00:45:01,657
Yes, I do.

612
00:45:03,033 --> 00:45:04,284
I cannot

613
00:45:04,785 --> 00:45:07,871
accept such generosity

614
00:45:08,372 --> 00:45:10,374
for free.

615
00:45:27,933 --> 00:45:29,226
Let's go!

616
00:45:30,978 --> 00:45:32,020
You're here, sister.

617
00:45:32,438 --> 00:45:33,689
Long time no see.

618
00:45:35,190 --> 00:45:36,483
How have you been, Ji-hu?

619
00:45:36,733 --> 00:45:38,610
-Hi, aunt.
-Hi.

620
00:45:49,246 --> 00:45:50,497
I'm so hungry.

621
00:45:50,581 --> 00:45:53,083
-Oh no. You should eat.
-Is there anything to eat here?

622
00:45:53,750 --> 00:45:55,836
Come on, stop eating.

623
00:45:55,919 --> 00:45:58,255
Ji-hu, did you take a
picture of me eating?

624
00:45:58,547 --> 00:46:01,383
-Stop it.
-She doesn't want you taking pictures.

625
00:46:01,675 --> 00:46:02,718
Hey.

626
00:46:04,428 --> 00:46:05,471
Goodness.

627
00:46:05,929 --> 00:46:06,889
Mr. Chairman,

628
00:46:08,348 --> 00:46:10,601
you look like an unmarried man.

629
00:46:14,146 --> 00:46:16,982
I'm going to change first.

630
00:46:17,649 --> 00:46:20,527
Everybody is waiting for you.
You should head out.

631
00:46:28,535 --> 00:46:29,828
Father's here.

632
00:46:29,995 --> 00:46:30,871
Father!

633
00:46:32,122 --> 00:46:33,165
Happy birthday!

634
00:46:34,541 --> 00:46:36,585
-Happy birthday!
-Thank you. Sit down.

635
00:46:36,668 --> 00:46:37,878
-Sit down.
-Happy birthday.

636
00:46:41,215 --> 00:46:43,383
-Happy birthday.
-Happy birthday.

637
00:46:43,550 --> 00:46:44,885
-Happy birthday.
-Thank you.

638
00:47:20,254 --> 00:47:21,964
When did you prepare all this?

639
00:47:22,297 --> 00:47:23,882
This is nothing, father.

640
00:47:25,968 --> 00:47:26,843
By the way,

641
00:47:27,553 --> 00:47:30,180
I don't see the caregiver
who follows strict rules.

642
00:47:30,556 --> 00:47:31,640
Is she fired already?

643
00:47:59,042 --> 00:48:00,043
Oh gosh.

644
00:48:00,502 --> 00:48:04,423
I cooked a dish that you like the most.

645
00:48:04,548 --> 00:48:06,466
How dare you bring such an inelegant food!

646
00:48:06,550 --> 00:48:08,135
Pigskins are inelegant?

647
00:48:09,094 --> 00:48:10,762
What's the point of elegance in food?

648
00:48:14,850 --> 00:48:15,684
Unbelievable.

649
00:48:16,101 --> 00:48:17,603
I can't believe this woman.

650
00:48:21,064 --> 00:48:22,065
Mr. Chairman,

651
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:25,652
open your mouth.

652
00:48:28,447 --> 00:48:30,073
Father, I want some too.

653
00:48:30,157 --> 00:48:31,366
Stop it.

654
00:48:32,534 --> 00:48:35,037
Have a seat. Don't just stand there.

655
00:48:37,748 --> 00:48:38,624
Sit down.

656
00:48:42,127 --> 00:48:43,170
Okay.

657
00:49:10,405 --> 00:49:11,615
-Gosh!
-Oh my!

658
00:49:18,497 --> 00:49:20,332
Mr. Chairman!

659
00:49:23,126 --> 00:49:24,419
Dad!

660
00:49:24,753 --> 00:49:26,046
Dad!

661
00:49:26,546 --> 00:49:28,757
She really did overreact just now.

662
00:49:29,466 --> 00:49:31,468
She almost killed father
on his own birthday.

663
00:49:31,635 --> 00:49:34,805
What did you just say?

664
00:49:34,971 --> 00:49:36,139
Am I wrong?

665
00:49:36,556 --> 00:49:38,850
What's the big deal about a cat?

666
00:49:41,353 --> 00:49:45,440
Unbelievable how she threw
herself to protect him.

667
00:49:45,899 --> 00:49:47,067
"Oh, Mr. Chairman!"

668
00:49:47,150 --> 00:49:48,985
She still has to leave the house.

669
00:49:49,194 --> 00:49:51,947
Who said she shouldn't?
Of course. I agree.

670
00:49:52,030 --> 00:49:55,534
I'm still searching for a replacement.
I'll take care of father before then.

671
00:49:57,077 --> 00:49:59,079
Will he accept that?

672
00:50:02,708 --> 00:50:03,750
Father.

673
00:50:05,460 --> 00:50:06,586
She's not leaving!

674
00:50:07,129 --> 00:50:08,213
Didn't you see her

675
00:50:09,047 --> 00:50:10,882
sacrificing herself to save me?

676
00:50:12,092 --> 00:50:14,219
Can any of you do that for me?

677
00:50:14,636 --> 00:50:16,054
Tell me!

678
00:50:16,304 --> 00:50:18,473
Father, this is unacceptable.

679
00:50:18,724 --> 00:50:20,183
She cannot stay here.

680
00:50:48,545 --> 00:50:49,713
Dad?

681
00:50:53,717 --> 00:50:56,845
She's the one who made me walk.

682
00:50:57,721 --> 00:51:00,056
Do you see? Do you?

683
00:51:00,766 --> 00:51:03,143
I'm standing

684
00:51:05,103 --> 00:51:06,146
and walking!

685
00:51:07,522 --> 00:51:08,523
You see?

686
00:51:42,682 --> 00:51:43,683
You.

687
00:51:44,518 --> 00:51:45,894
Let's pull off a performance.

688
00:51:50,774 --> 00:51:52,651
Just a little bit more inward.

689
00:51:53,735 --> 00:51:55,779
There're going to be one, two...

690
00:52:21,555 --> 00:52:23,890
What's the big deal about a
criminal record? She served time.

691
00:52:24,683 --> 00:52:25,600
What?

692
00:52:25,892 --> 00:52:28,353
Practically speaking, my friend
has a criminal record for fraud.

693
00:52:28,436 --> 00:52:30,105
Crimes that involve money
are petty crimes.

694
00:52:30,188 --> 00:52:33,733
What's the big deal? Are you serious?

695
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:36,444
Ex-criminals are entitled
to opportunities, too.

696
00:52:36,528 --> 00:52:38,822
What would they do if
the whole society deprives them?

697
00:52:39,072 --> 00:52:42,325
I can't believe this.
You should be friends with Jesus.

698
00:52:42,409 --> 00:52:45,287
No. He's not my type.
He has no sense of humor.

699
00:52:46,329 --> 00:52:49,124
He stood up. She made a man rise.

700
00:52:49,291 --> 00:52:50,250
That's important.

701
00:52:50,458 --> 00:52:53,044
Go to sleep. This is going nowhere.

702
00:52:53,128 --> 00:52:55,422
Just about to. I'm so tired.

703
00:54:48,535 --> 00:54:49,411
Cat?

704
00:54:52,872 --> 00:54:53,873
Cat!

705
00:54:55,500 --> 00:54:56,334
Cat.

706
00:54:59,254 --> 00:55:00,088
Cat.

707
00:55:03,508 --> 00:55:04,384
Cat?

708
00:55:10,515 --> 00:55:11,349
Cat?

709
00:55:25,697 --> 00:55:26,740
Cat!

710
00:55:30,035 --> 00:55:31,036
Cat!

711
00:55:32,787 --> 00:55:34,622
Shouldn't you be at the hospital?

712
00:55:35,874 --> 00:55:36,875
Cat!

713
00:55:39,044 --> 00:55:39,878
Cat!

714
00:55:40,170 --> 00:55:41,546
The cat is not in the house.

715
00:55:45,425 --> 00:55:46,801
I threw it out.

716
00:55:52,474 --> 00:55:56,019
Cat!

717
00:55:56,436 --> 00:55:57,353
Cat!

718
00:55:59,731 --> 00:56:01,983
Cat!

719
00:56:03,026 --> 00:56:03,943
Cat!

720
00:56:07,655 --> 00:56:08,907
Cat!

721
00:56:09,824 --> 00:56:10,909
Cat.

722
00:56:17,707 --> 00:56:19,709
Cat.

723
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:22,003
Cat!

724
00:57:03,336 --> 00:57:04,337
You.

725
00:57:05,588 --> 00:57:06,464
Get out!

726
00:57:32,824 --> 00:57:33,700
Un-gyu!

727
00:57:35,535 --> 00:57:36,661
Aunt A-jin.

728
00:58:05,815 --> 00:58:07,192
What do you think you're doing?

729
00:58:09,068 --> 00:58:10,445
You're here.

730
00:58:10,528 --> 00:58:12,405
I asked you a question!

731
00:58:14,532 --> 00:58:17,660
Un-gyu, what is going on?
When did you go out?

732
00:58:17,785 --> 00:58:20,497
You better explain exactly what happened.

733
00:58:23,374 --> 00:58:26,711
What did I do wrong, Ms. Woo?

734
00:58:28,796 --> 00:58:29,881
Don't you know?

735
00:58:29,964 --> 00:58:31,257
What's going on?

736
00:58:31,633 --> 00:58:33,051
An eye for an eye,

737
00:58:34,427 --> 00:58:35,803
a tooth for a tooth.

738
00:58:37,514 --> 00:58:39,682
She got rid of my baby,

739
00:58:40,141 --> 00:58:41,601
so I got rid of hers.

740
00:58:42,227 --> 00:58:43,686
You...

741
00:58:44,812 --> 00:58:46,564
Stop it!

742
00:58:47,565 --> 00:58:49,901
Stop it before you embarrass yourself
in front of your son!

743
00:58:49,984 --> 00:58:51,027
Bok-ja Park!

744
00:58:53,488 --> 00:58:54,489
That's enough.

745
00:58:56,449 --> 00:58:57,492
Stop now!

746
00:58:58,034 --> 00:58:59,619
If I had stopped,

747
00:59:05,875 --> 00:59:07,961
just like she said,

748
00:59:09,712 --> 00:59:13,550
would I be alive?

749
00:59:14,509 --> 00:59:15,718
Stop!

750
00:59:19,264 --> 00:59:21,099
Stop this at once!

751
00:59:49,961 --> 00:59:53,840
I won't even take one step out
of this house.

752
00:59:53,923 --> 00:59:55,300
Ju-mi! Please, Ju-mi.

753
00:59:55,383 --> 00:59:58,845
How are you going to deal
with Mr. Chairman

754
00:59:58,928 --> 01:00:01,014
if I leave?

755
01:00:01,264 --> 01:00:02,557
That crazy woman.

756
01:00:04,809 --> 01:00:07,979
He has also been exercising
early in the morning every day.

757
01:00:08,062 --> 01:00:10,189
Are you seeing the artist
who draws these cartoons?

758
01:00:10,565 --> 01:00:12,066
A kiss doesn't mean we're dating.

759
01:00:14,319 --> 01:00:15,653
Don't you think it's strange?

760
01:00:15,737 --> 01:00:17,697
-It's totally strange.
-Partner.

761
01:00:17,780 --> 01:00:19,032
Sir, are you all right?

762
01:00:19,115 --> 01:00:20,658
Shall we live together,

763
01:00:20,825 --> 01:00:23,244
as husband and wife?

764
01:00:23,703 --> 01:00:26,080
I'll only listen to Mr. Chairman.

765
01:00:26,164 --> 01:00:28,541
I won't be taking orders from anyone else.

766
01:00:29,042 --> 01:00:30,293
She grew up as an orphan.

767
01:00:30,543 --> 01:00:33,671
She was adopted at the age of ten,
but was abandoned for some reason.

768
01:00:34,756 --> 01:00:36,007
What is it that you want?

769
01:00:36,090 --> 01:00:38,551
Tell me what you want.

770
01:00:40,094 --> 01:00:42,013
What I want is...

771
01:00:42,096 --> 01:00:44,098
