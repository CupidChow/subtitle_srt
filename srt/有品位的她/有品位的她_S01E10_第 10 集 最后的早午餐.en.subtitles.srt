1
00:00:47,088 --> 00:00:49,132
She's okay with leaving
that painting up on our wall?

2
00:00:50,258 --> 00:00:51,843
Is she Mother Teresa or what?

3
00:00:52,927 --> 00:00:55,013
Or does she not love her husband at all?

4
00:00:56,222 --> 00:00:57,640
I don't get her.

5
00:01:08,318 --> 00:01:09,652
That woman...

6
00:01:10,528 --> 00:01:12,030
How dare she lay a hand on my woman?

7
00:01:45,897 --> 00:01:47,273
Father called me.

8
00:01:48,316 --> 00:01:51,194
He wants you to manage
the factory rent now on.

9
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:56,825
We're planning to move out.

10
00:01:58,284 --> 00:02:00,245
We were going to live on our own anyway.

11
00:02:00,703 --> 00:02:01,871
We already bought a place too.

12
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:05,458
You should look after everything
in the house from now on.

13
00:02:08,294 --> 00:02:11,089
All right, I will.

14
00:02:14,092 --> 00:02:16,177
By the way, where are you moving to?

15
00:02:29,232 --> 00:02:30,150
Honey.

16
00:02:32,402 --> 00:02:34,737
A-jin and her family want to live
on their own.

17
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,115
-What?
-To tell you the truth,

18
00:02:37,407 --> 00:02:39,617
there has been a little problem.

19
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:43,163
Jae-seok has been having an affair.

20
00:02:43,955 --> 00:02:44,873
What did you just say?

21
00:02:44,956 --> 00:02:48,251
You're very fond of A-jin.

22
00:02:48,334 --> 00:02:50,336
I know that better than anyone else does.

23
00:02:50,712 --> 00:02:53,006
Plus, this is a crucial time
for the company,

24
00:02:53,089 --> 00:02:54,424
as you're well aware.

25
00:02:54,924 --> 00:02:57,802
I thought that the situation
could get really bad because he's the one

26
00:02:57,886 --> 00:02:59,888
who's practically
in charge of the company now,

27
00:03:00,263 --> 00:03:01,681
so I got involved a little.

28
00:03:01,764 --> 00:03:03,766
What are you talking about?
Be more specific.

29
00:03:04,726 --> 00:03:09,439
As soon as I heard that Jae-seok
is having an affair,

30
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:12,066
I went over to his mistress' place.

31
00:03:12,525 --> 00:03:13,401
And?

32
00:03:13,776 --> 00:03:18,281
Well, she has a nice body
and she's pretty.

33
00:03:18,364 --> 00:03:19,240
She's young too.

34
00:03:19,324 --> 00:03:21,618
Overall, she lacks morals,

35
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:23,620
but I have to admit
that she's a hot chick.

36
00:03:23,786 --> 00:03:26,039
Gosh, that punk. Is he out of his mind?

37
00:03:26,164 --> 00:03:27,665
He can't be philandering now.

38
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:32,086
I think she's the artist whose painting

39
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:35,340
was used in our products' packaging.

40
00:03:35,757 --> 00:03:36,674
What?

41
00:03:37,508 --> 00:03:40,428
I saw many paintings at her place.

42
00:03:42,305 --> 00:03:43,473
So,

43
00:03:44,474 --> 00:03:46,559
are you saying that he pushed
to put the image

44
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:49,771
of that cartoon-like painting
on all of our products

45
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:51,606
because of that woman?

46
00:03:51,981 --> 00:03:54,400
It looks like
their relationship is quite serious.

47
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:58,321
How can he run the company
when his mind is elsewhere?

48
00:03:58,863 --> 00:04:00,198
He must be

49
00:04:00,657 --> 00:04:03,409
very distracted now.

50
00:04:03,826 --> 00:04:06,120
Where's that punk now? That crazy moron.

51
00:04:06,829 --> 00:04:09,832
I entrusted him with the company because
he's the best one out of my children.

52
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:11,542
How can he cheat on A-jin?

53
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:16,130
Did you trespass on someone's property
at Unit 306 in Kiam Apartment?

54
00:04:16,381 --> 00:04:17,382
Someone damaged the property

55
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:20,218
and insulted as well as
physically assaulted a young lady

56
00:04:20,301 --> 00:04:21,719
who has no ability to defend herself.

57
00:04:21,886 --> 00:04:24,138
Was it your doing?

58
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:27,517
-You bastard!
-Dad!

59
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,685
You punk. You moron.

60
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:30,770
Dad, why are you being like this?

61
00:04:30,853 --> 00:04:33,523
Are you having an affair?
Have you been cheating on A-jin?

62
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,525
You piece of...

63
00:04:36,651 --> 00:04:37,819
You almost ripped my mouth off.

64
00:04:37,902 --> 00:04:39,487
You crazy punk. You must've gone insane.

65
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:41,864
You should've at least made sure
to hide it from Ji-hu and A-jin.

66
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:43,074
What on earth were you thinking?

67
00:04:43,157 --> 00:04:45,410
Why don't you advertise it
on the newspaper?

68
00:04:45,493 --> 00:04:47,287
Dad, why are you being like this?

69
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:50,164
You, out of all people,
should understand me.

70
00:04:50,456 --> 00:04:53,293
-What? Have you completely lost your mind?
-Gosh, seriously!

71
00:04:53,376 --> 00:04:55,503
You've always done everything
you wanted to do.

72
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,505
How many affairs have you had?

73
00:04:57,588 --> 00:04:58,506
You prick.

74
00:04:58,589 --> 00:05:00,883
Are you saying that you're having
an affair because I did?

75
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:03,219
No, that's not what I meant.
What I'm saying is that

76
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:04,971
you out of all people,
shouldn't criticize me.

77
00:05:05,054 --> 00:05:07,265
Men must have a sense
of responsibility and commitment.

78
00:05:07,557 --> 00:05:09,475
How can you philander
when you have a wife and a kid?

79
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:11,227
Dad, please don't be like this.

80
00:05:11,561 --> 00:05:12,729
Just help me out, okay?

81
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:14,272
What? Help you out?

82
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:16,524
I love that woman.

83
00:05:16,607 --> 00:05:18,276
-Which woman?
-That woman.

84
00:05:18,359 --> 00:05:20,445
-Be specific. Which one?
-The new one.

85
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:22,238
You piece of... What? "The new one"?

86
00:05:22,363 --> 00:05:24,157
Are you saying A-jin is old
and ragged or what?

87
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,617
You little piece of shit.
How dare you say such a thing?

88
00:05:26,701 --> 00:05:28,995
Just die. I want you gone from my sight.

89
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:32,707
Dad! You must know what it's like
because you've been in love too.

90
00:05:32,915 --> 00:05:34,751
I can't control my heart.

91
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:37,837
It's not like you fell in love with her
because you wanted to.

92
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:40,798
You know better than anyone else
that we can't control these things.

93
00:05:41,049 --> 00:05:45,053
That woman just walked
into my life out of nowhere one day.

94
00:05:45,136 --> 00:05:46,387
End it immediately!

95
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:49,640
Then get down on your knees
and beg A-jin to forgive you.

96
00:05:49,724 --> 00:05:51,684
No, I can't do that.

97
00:05:51,809 --> 00:05:54,103
Then what? Are you saying
that you'll divorce A-jin?

98
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:57,315
Why would I get divorced?
I love that woman.

99
00:05:57,398 --> 00:05:58,524
Which woman?

100
00:05:58,608 --> 00:06:00,693
-That woman.
-For God's sake. Which one?

101
00:06:00,777 --> 00:06:03,279
-A-jin.
-What a crazy prick.

102
00:06:03,571 --> 00:06:04,489
You bastard.

103
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:06,240
Earlier, you said that it's "the new one."

104
00:06:06,324 --> 00:06:08,493
Now, you're saying that it's A-jin?

105
00:06:08,743 --> 00:06:11,496
Look at you with so many women.
Good for you!

106
00:06:11,662 --> 00:06:14,540
Gosh. Stop hitting me, will you?

107
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:17,376
Why are you getting so mad at me
when you have a mistress yourself?

108
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:20,338
You brat. She's not a mistress.

109
00:06:20,421 --> 00:06:21,255
She's my second wife.

110
00:06:21,339 --> 00:06:23,633
-It's the same thing.
-It's clearly different.

111
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:27,512
If you show up in front of that woman

112
00:06:27,595 --> 00:06:29,931
and do something like that ever again,
I'll teach you a lesson.

113
00:06:30,014 --> 00:06:30,848
You got that?

114
00:06:31,432 --> 00:06:33,476
What? You'll teach her a lesson?

115
00:06:33,684 --> 00:06:36,062
-Who do you think you are? You bastard.
-Dad! Gosh...

116
00:06:36,145 --> 00:06:37,897
Stop hitting me, please.

117
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:41,984
I'll fire you if you don't end it
with that woman immediately.

118
00:06:42,401 --> 00:06:43,361
Which one?

119
00:06:43,653 --> 00:06:46,030
Do you think I'm cracking a joke now?

120
00:06:46,114 --> 00:06:46,989
Gosh.

121
00:06:52,203 --> 00:06:56,207
I'll neither get divorced
nor break up with that woman.

122
00:06:56,415 --> 00:06:58,000
I'll also work hard
to run the company well.

123
00:06:59,877 --> 00:07:00,837
That's it for now.

124
00:07:01,838 --> 00:07:03,881
You... Get back here, you rat.

125
00:07:04,882 --> 00:07:06,342
Gosh, that punk drives me nuts.

126
00:07:11,222 --> 00:07:13,182
Mr. Chairman.

127
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:16,727
-Yes.
-You just walked.

128
00:07:17,645 --> 00:07:19,313
You walked on your own.

129
00:07:22,692 --> 00:07:25,570
Oh, you're right. I did.

130
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:27,947
My gosh, Mr. Chairman.

131
00:07:28,614 --> 00:07:31,242
Your bratty son
did something good for a change.

132
00:07:33,786 --> 00:07:34,704
I'm so happy.

133
00:07:34,787 --> 00:07:36,122
-My, this makes me really happy.
-Okay.

134
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:39,959
Mr. Chairman, I can't believe it.

135
00:07:40,042 --> 00:07:41,711
Great job.

136
00:07:42,587 --> 00:07:45,256
I wrote my statement and submitted
the medical certificate to the police.

137
00:07:46,215 --> 00:07:47,884
You could have waited
until you get discharged.

138
00:07:48,426 --> 00:07:49,802
I guess you wanted to rush it.

139
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,222
I won't go easy on him.
I'll be sure to put him behind bars.

140
00:07:54,265 --> 00:07:56,642
-Sure, do it.
-I was torn because he has a kid,

141
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:59,645
but I really can't forgive him.

142
00:08:02,064 --> 00:08:05,359
Do whatever you want.

143
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:08,529
Show me what you can do.

144
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:10,406
I'm curious too.

145
00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:12,867
What did you just say?

146
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:15,161
Are you going to hit me here?

147
00:08:16,537 --> 00:08:18,414
You probably don't want people to see it.

148
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:22,418
If anyone sees it,
you might end up behind bars yourself.

149
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:28,132
Why are you so confident?

150
00:08:32,845 --> 00:08:34,305
How can I be confident?

151
00:08:34,722 --> 00:08:36,933
I guess I'm just used to your abuse now.

152
00:08:37,099 --> 00:08:38,726
That's probably why
I'm not as scared anymore.

153
00:08:40,228 --> 00:08:41,604
Take your time.

154
00:08:41,812 --> 00:08:44,482
I have to meet someone today.

155
00:08:46,067 --> 00:08:47,944
I've already completed
the discharge procedures.

156
00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:55,076
WIFE

157
00:09:07,088 --> 00:09:10,299
This...

158
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:27,233
It must've been rough in there.

159
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:41,664
My gosh!

160
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:45,376
Don't. Just stay in my room with me.

161
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:46,627
Don't go upstairs.

162
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:54,051
Let's talk.

163
00:10:01,684 --> 00:10:03,853
There's something I must check with you.

164
00:10:05,479 --> 00:10:09,150
You remember the canopy collapsing
on Father's birthday, right?

165
00:10:11,193 --> 00:10:13,237
Why are you bringing that up
out of the blue?

166
00:10:13,738 --> 00:10:16,282
A-jin showed me a video clip.

167
00:10:16,824 --> 00:10:18,743
In the video, you can clearly see a guy

168
00:10:19,076 --> 00:10:21,120
doing something to the canopy.

169
00:10:24,373 --> 00:10:26,667
It was easy for us
to find out who that guy was.

170
00:10:27,084 --> 00:10:29,462
He's a personal trainer
at the gym Father goes to.

171
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:33,215
Why did he do that?

172
00:10:33,382 --> 00:10:36,469
That guy said that I gave him the order.

173
00:10:37,428 --> 00:10:40,514
Apparently, I told him to make it collapse
to hurt you.

174
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:42,725
Goodness.

175
00:10:42,808 --> 00:10:45,895
Why did you make him
do such a thing, Ju-mi?

176
00:10:46,896 --> 00:10:49,857
And why are you telling me this?

177
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:51,150
After all this time.

178
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:53,569
How can you even say that?

179
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:56,489
I know that it was your doing!

180
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:01,410
Aren't you a professor?

181
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:06,207
Are you naive or dumb?

182
00:11:06,457 --> 00:11:09,627
Or is your judgment clouded
because you're emotional right now?

183
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:11,962
I know what you're calculating
in that head of yours.

184
00:11:12,588 --> 00:11:14,715
You're trying to suffocate all of us

185
00:11:14,965 --> 00:11:17,051
so that you can have Father
wrapped around your finger

186
00:11:17,134 --> 00:11:19,303
and take control
over the entire household.

187
00:11:21,722 --> 00:11:23,015
Do you think we'll let that happen?

188
00:11:23,474 --> 00:11:25,309
Look, Ju-mi.

189
00:11:25,976 --> 00:11:29,522
I guess your husband spending a night
in the detention room wasn't enough.

190
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:32,358
Hey, I can easily tell the police

191
00:11:32,441 --> 00:11:35,361
that the bullet wasn't misfired
and that he actually tried to kill me.

192
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:40,199
If you want to threaten me,
do it at the right time.

193
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:44,328
The canopy incident?

194
00:11:45,913 --> 00:11:48,749
Truth doesn't always win in this world.

195
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:51,836
What wins becomes the truth.

196
00:11:53,421 --> 00:11:54,505
What did you say?

197
00:11:54,588 --> 00:11:56,132
You just told me

198
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:59,176
that the personal trainer said
you ordered him to do it.

199
00:11:59,343 --> 00:12:03,389
Then you are the one
who told him to do it.

200
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:06,016
That's how this world works.

201
00:12:06,308 --> 00:12:09,353
You spoiled, clueless rich woman.

202
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:57,651
Ms. Yun.

203
00:12:58,194 --> 00:12:59,236
Yes, Ms. Seo.

204
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,197
I heard that you've been seeing
A-jin's husband.

205
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:07,286
Well, many girls date
married men these days.

206
00:13:07,369 --> 00:13:10,915
But A-jin has done so much for you.

207
00:13:11,499 --> 00:13:12,708
How can you do that to her?

208
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:16,003
No decent person
would ever do such a thing.

209
00:13:17,755 --> 00:13:18,923
It's love.

210
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:20,883
I couldn't help it.

211
00:13:21,175 --> 00:13:22,218
"Love"?

212
00:13:25,346 --> 00:13:28,015
Is her husband that irresistible?

213
00:13:28,265 --> 00:13:29,934
Enough for you to betray her like this?

214
00:13:31,685 --> 00:13:34,271
Are you wondering why I'm trying
to meddle in your personal life?

215
00:13:34,522 --> 00:13:35,356
Yes.

216
00:13:36,857 --> 00:13:37,858
End it.

217
00:13:38,108 --> 00:13:39,610
You better not break A-jin's heart.

218
00:13:39,818 --> 00:13:42,530
I thought you'd understand me.

219
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:46,450
I mean, you're in
the same situation as me.

220
00:13:47,034 --> 00:13:48,827
What on earth are you talking about?

221
00:13:48,953 --> 00:13:50,287
You must know what it's like

222
00:13:50,788 --> 00:13:52,414
because you've been bashed
for the same reason.

223
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:53,499
Hey.

224
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:55,376
How dare you.

225
00:13:55,793 --> 00:13:57,586
Did you just insinuate
that we're in the same boat?

226
00:13:57,670 --> 00:14:00,172
My paintings are completely separate
from my personal life.

227
00:14:00,256 --> 00:14:02,341
You and I belong
to different social classes.

228
00:14:02,716 --> 00:14:04,552
You have quite the nerve.

229
00:14:04,635 --> 00:14:05,886
How are we different?

230
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:11,559
You're a mistress too.

231
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:18,190
Hey. What?

232
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:20,401
"Mistress"?

233
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:24,113
"Mistress"?

234
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:28,075
Ms. Kim.

235
00:14:29,118 --> 00:14:29,952
Ms. Kim!

236
00:14:32,454 --> 00:14:34,832
-Yes, ma'am.
-Take down all of her paintings.

237
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:37,751
-Pardon?
-Did you not hear what I just said?

238
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:40,296
All six of them. Take them down.

239
00:14:40,671 --> 00:14:43,799
Ms. Seo, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean it that way.

240
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:45,759
Take them down immediately
and unframe them.

241
00:14:48,095 --> 00:14:49,054
What's going on?

242
00:14:50,514 --> 00:14:52,141
Ms. Feiko Morinake is here.

243
00:14:52,933 --> 00:14:54,768
What? When did she get here?

244
00:14:54,852 --> 00:14:57,146
She said she'd like to take a look
around the gallery quietly...

245
00:14:58,314 --> 00:14:59,857
This is incredible.

246
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:03,444
This painting is really...
How should I put this?

247
00:15:04,361 --> 00:15:06,614
I can't describe it in words,
but it's truly perfect.

248
00:15:06,822 --> 00:15:08,908
Shall I say that the whole painting exudes

249
00:15:08,991 --> 00:15:12,536
a visceral yet indescribable sense of pain

250
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:15,497
from scars and wounds of war?

251
00:15:15,831 --> 00:15:17,791
I'd like to purchase this piece,

252
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:20,419
no matter what the price may be.

253
00:15:25,549 --> 00:15:26,383
Honey.

254
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,803
I've been thinking
about going back to school.

255
00:15:30,012 --> 00:15:33,432
I think that it's the only way
I can help you.

256
00:15:34,391 --> 00:15:36,560
That will be great. You should do it.

257
00:15:38,562 --> 00:15:40,147
I'm interested

258
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:43,108
in the global MBA program
at Hanguk University,

259
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:44,985
but I have to have
an executive-level position

260
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:48,656
at a company to be considered
for admission.

261
00:15:48,739 --> 00:15:50,449
Yes, I'm aware.

262
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:53,869
That being said...

263
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:56,580
I'm wondering

264
00:15:57,331 --> 00:16:01,502
if you can create a position for me even
if it's nothing official or proper.

265
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:03,587
Gosh, that's not a problem at all.

266
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:05,047
Study hard.

267
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:06,632
You have all my support.

268
00:16:08,258 --> 00:16:11,011
Since I was a kid,
I've always had the ability

269
00:16:11,095 --> 00:16:14,306
to understand way beyond
what I was taught.

270
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:15,766
You don't even need to tell me that.

271
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,434
I know how bright you are.

272
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:21,271
I'll give people at work a heads-up today,
so go ahead and register right away.

273
00:16:23,023 --> 00:16:24,274
Okay.

274
00:16:26,443 --> 00:16:27,945
You're just so adorable.

275
00:16:30,948 --> 00:16:32,491
It's too early for this.

276
00:16:39,623 --> 00:16:42,084
This room will be perfect as my studio.

277
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:44,920
It's so spacious. I love it.

278
00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:46,046
That sounds good.

279
00:16:46,338 --> 00:16:47,798
Do you want to check out the bedroom too?

280
00:16:47,881 --> 00:16:48,757
Shall we?

281
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:51,760
It's this way.

282
00:16:56,306 --> 00:16:58,100
This room is so nice.

283
00:16:58,225 --> 00:16:59,935
It has been ages
since I felt like a newlywed.

284
00:17:02,813 --> 00:17:04,732
Someone told me
that I'll be very lucky this year.

285
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:06,650
The lady who bought my painting today
is married

286
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:08,610
to the CEO of the biggest natto company
in Japan.

287
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:10,362
I heard that she has a keen eye for art.

288
00:17:10,612 --> 00:17:13,115
What an honor.
I'm in love with such an amazing artist.

289
00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:17,745
All of these fascinating things
only started happening after I met you.

290
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:21,081
Strictly speaking,
you owe it all to A-jin, not me.

291
00:17:22,499 --> 00:17:25,544
You're either
absolutely clueless or naive.

292
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:28,756
I've been told that I'm pure-hearted.
She said that's why she likes me.

293
00:17:28,922 --> 00:17:30,382
-Who's "she"?
-A-jin.

294
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:35,554
Seong-hui. Hey, wait up.

295
00:17:35,637 --> 00:17:38,265
EXCHANGE RATE: THE VALUE OF A NATION'S
CURRENCY AGAINST ANOTHER CURRENCY.

296
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:46,315
What took you so long?

297
00:17:46,815 --> 00:17:48,609
I've been waiting for the right moment.

298
00:17:50,527 --> 00:17:52,029
You seem to be doing great.

299
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:56,742
You and I go back a long time, you know.

300
00:17:57,576 --> 00:17:59,495
When you first came to the orphanage,

301
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:03,624
I felt so bad for you,
the three-year-old kid who kept crying

302
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:06,877
that I even saved my food
and gave it to you.

303
00:18:08,545 --> 00:18:11,507
Then after I got hired as a bookkeeper
at the company

304
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:14,176
that supported the orphanage,
I even hooked you up with the job

305
00:18:14,384 --> 00:18:16,178
as the chairman's personal driver.

306
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:18,013
Why are you bringing that up now?

307
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:21,725
We embezzled the company funds together
seven years ago,

308
00:18:22,309 --> 00:18:25,354
but you dumped everything on me.
What did you say to me back then?

309
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:29,775
You told me that you'll repay me
for taking all the blame.

310
00:18:31,193 --> 00:18:32,319
I did say that.

311
00:18:35,405 --> 00:18:39,326
I couldn't get a job
after I got out of jail,

312
00:18:40,202 --> 00:18:41,203
so I ended up working

313
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:44,081
at a bar.

314
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:47,126
Back then,

315
00:18:48,335 --> 00:18:51,505
I seriously contemplated
tracking you down and killing you.

316
00:18:52,589 --> 00:18:54,049
I am sorry about what happened.

317
00:18:55,551 --> 00:18:56,760
I thought that I needed to survive

318
00:18:57,678 --> 00:18:59,972
to be able to help you.

319
00:19:01,348 --> 00:19:05,310
But I just couldn't hate you.

320
00:19:09,231 --> 00:19:10,149
That day,

321
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:14,403
you made me a bowl of ramen

322
00:19:14,778 --> 00:19:16,697
with an egg.

323
00:19:18,574 --> 00:19:20,409
And for some odd reason,
that bowl of ramen

324
00:19:22,244 --> 00:19:23,745
felt like your sincere heart.

325
00:19:25,789 --> 00:19:28,125
Then you apologized to me

326
00:19:28,959 --> 00:19:33,130
and gave me 80,000 won
which was all you had.

327
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:37,551
That day,

328
00:19:39,261 --> 00:19:40,554
I forgave you.

329
00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:43,432
That's why I got you that big gig.

330
00:19:49,897 --> 00:19:50,939
You know what?

331
00:19:53,442 --> 00:19:55,694
I hope that you're a loyal person.

332
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:58,780
I'll look after you if that's the case.

333
00:19:59,948 --> 00:20:01,158
Show me your loyalty.

334
00:20:01,241 --> 00:20:03,118
What more do you want me to do?

335
00:20:07,789 --> 00:20:10,334
Finish what you already started
without any mistakes.

336
00:20:20,135 --> 00:20:22,763
YUN-JAE'S MOM

337
00:20:34,274 --> 00:20:35,901
Why can't I put this on?

338
00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:39,696
Seong-su.

339
00:20:40,614 --> 00:20:43,116
Let's not see each other
for the next little while.

340
00:20:44,117 --> 00:20:45,953
-Why?
-My husband is out of the hospital now.

341
00:20:46,703 --> 00:20:48,288
He's getting discharged
sooner than I thought.

342
00:20:48,372 --> 00:20:49,665
You said he'd be there for 12 weeks.

343
00:20:49,873 --> 00:20:52,668
Apparently, he recovered quickly
because he used to be an athlete.

344
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:56,672
The fact that he's been discharged
doesn't mean we can't see each other.

345
00:21:01,051 --> 00:21:02,261
I'm pregnant.

346
00:21:09,393 --> 00:21:11,603
You said that you're infertile.

347
00:21:12,312 --> 00:21:13,188
I know.

348
00:21:14,648 --> 00:21:16,191
I thought I was.

349
00:21:18,318 --> 00:21:20,404
-When did you find out?
-A few days ago.

350
00:21:24,658 --> 00:21:25,993
Whose kid, is it?

351
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:27,953
I'm not sure.

352
00:21:28,829 --> 00:21:30,455
We'll find out when the baby is born.

353
00:21:31,206 --> 00:21:32,291
I'll head out first.

354
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:47,597
It looked like you were shopping
to let off some steam.

355
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:49,266
What's going on?

356
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:53,145
Hyo-ju.

357
00:21:53,895 --> 00:21:55,188
My husband is cheating on me.

358
00:21:55,897 --> 00:21:56,732
My gosh.

359
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:58,900
-Are you serious?
-Should I kill him?

360
00:22:03,071 --> 00:22:04,906
How have you been putting up with it?

361
00:22:07,743 --> 00:22:09,578
An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.

362
00:22:10,537 --> 00:22:11,955
I got myself a boyfriend too.

363
00:22:12,789 --> 00:22:14,583
You know what's funny though?

364
00:22:15,709 --> 00:22:19,504
You'll totally understand your husband
when you get a boyfriend.

365
00:22:20,589 --> 00:22:21,840
It's exciting.

366
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:24,676
A young guy.

367
00:22:25,594 --> 00:22:28,638
Seeing him helps me
keep my hormones in balance.

368
00:22:29,973 --> 00:22:31,808
It's definitely not something
money can buy me.

369
00:22:32,267 --> 00:22:33,143
So what?

370
00:22:33,727 --> 00:22:35,562
Are you suggesting
that I should have an affair too?

371
00:22:36,104 --> 00:22:37,898
That's not what I meant.

372
00:22:39,066 --> 00:22:41,860
I have another son.
He's older than Jeong-hyeon.

373
00:22:42,903 --> 00:22:43,945
I know that.

374
00:22:44,613 --> 00:22:45,989
I mean, who doesn't?

375
00:22:46,323 --> 00:22:47,866
I'm raising an ill child.

376
00:22:49,076 --> 00:22:52,746
Are you saying I should have an affair
just like what his father is doing?

377
00:22:54,915 --> 00:22:58,585
Why are you talking about your son?
You're making me feel bad.

378
00:23:01,379 --> 00:23:02,422
Let's be honest though.

379
00:23:02,839 --> 00:23:06,343
Moms must feel at ease
without any resentment or anger

380
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,595
to be able to raise their children well.

381
00:23:11,723 --> 00:23:13,433
How am I going to see
that girl's face tomorrow?

382
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:15,435
Are you meeting that girl tomorrow?

383
00:23:15,602 --> 00:23:17,229
We have our brunch tomorrow, you know.

384
00:23:21,775 --> 00:23:22,859
Are you saying

385
00:23:23,777 --> 00:23:25,654
that one of our members

386
00:23:26,404 --> 00:23:28,949
is seeing your husband?

387
00:23:39,167 --> 00:23:40,001
A-jin.

388
00:23:41,628 --> 00:23:42,587
A-jin.

389
00:23:44,965 --> 00:23:46,299
A-jin, are you okay?

390
00:23:47,509 --> 00:23:48,343
Yes.

391
00:23:48,969 --> 00:23:50,303
This helps me let off some steam.

392
00:23:51,721 --> 00:23:53,056
Is Jae-seok not home yet?

393
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:55,767
What does my schedule look like tomorrow?

394
00:23:56,726 --> 00:23:58,770
You have the brunch tomorrow.

395
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:01,565
I'm not in the mood to go to that thing.

396
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:31,052
Hey, Hyo-ju.

397
00:24:31,303 --> 00:24:33,430
-How have you been?
-Good. How are things with you?

398
00:24:35,182 --> 00:24:37,225
-You guys are early.
-Hey, you made it.

399
00:24:37,601 --> 00:24:39,603
-Hello.
-Hello.

400
00:24:45,942 --> 00:24:46,985
Thank you.

401
00:24:49,905 --> 00:24:51,698
Is this sharp enough to kill someone?

402
00:24:56,411 --> 00:24:58,163
I was just curious. Don't mind me.

403
00:24:59,831 --> 00:25:03,376
This will be the last brunch
I'm attending.

404
00:25:04,461 --> 00:25:05,629
I'm selling the institute.

405
00:25:06,046 --> 00:25:09,382
I've concluded that it contradicts
with my educational philosophy,

406
00:25:09,507 --> 00:25:10,467
so that's it.

407
00:25:12,135 --> 00:25:14,304
We're sorry to hear that.

408
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:15,889
Don't be.

409
00:25:16,932 --> 00:25:20,518
Then please tutor our kids.
We can pay you however much you'd like.

410
00:25:21,519 --> 00:25:23,605
-Which kids?
-What do you think?

411
00:25:24,064 --> 00:25:26,524
Su-min, Jeong-hyeon, and Ji-hu.
Just those three.

412
00:25:28,485 --> 00:25:29,778
Why are you excluding Yun-jae?

413
00:25:32,697 --> 00:25:33,823
Why should we include him?

414
00:25:34,658 --> 00:25:36,993
I'm speechless.
What kind of question is that?

415
00:25:37,244 --> 00:25:38,370
What does that even mean?

416
00:25:38,787 --> 00:25:41,873
We let you join us even though
you're far below our league.

417
00:25:42,123 --> 00:25:43,124
Let's be honest here.

418
00:25:43,625 --> 00:25:45,627
Yun-jae isn't even your son.

419
00:25:46,211 --> 00:25:47,963
Gi-ok, you're out of line.

420
00:25:48,046 --> 00:25:49,256
What is this about?

421
00:25:49,798 --> 00:25:51,049
You better watch what you say.

422
00:25:51,132 --> 00:25:53,677
You came from nothing.
I guess you feel like you've made it

423
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:56,429
now that you're living in Gangnam,
acting like you belong to the upper class.

424
00:25:56,554 --> 00:26:00,183
Do you think you can change the fact
that you came from nothing

425
00:26:00,267 --> 00:26:02,811
by raising someone else's child
and acting like you're one of us?

426
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:04,271
Absolutely not.

427
00:26:04,854 --> 00:26:07,983
A dirty rag is still a dirty rag
no matter how many times you wash it.

428
00:26:08,441 --> 00:26:10,402
What? "A dirty rag"?

429
00:26:11,027 --> 00:26:13,321
Gi-ok, I don't think
you should be talking about this here.

430
00:26:13,613 --> 00:26:16,491
Gyeong-hui and you should talk about it
some other time. Stop now.

431
00:26:16,616 --> 00:26:17,993
Yes, this isn't a good idea.

432
00:26:18,076 --> 00:26:20,787
Hey, I heard that you used to make
announcements at a racetrack.

433
00:26:21,788 --> 00:26:25,000
And what? You used to be an announcer
at a broadcasting station? What a liar.

434
00:26:25,083 --> 00:26:26,209
Did you just call me a liar?

435
00:26:27,669 --> 00:26:29,212
Jeez, how shameless.

436
00:26:29,379 --> 00:26:30,755
Look who's talking.

437
00:26:31,256 --> 00:26:34,634
You said you worked as a pharmacist
at the hospital your husband used to work.

438
00:26:35,302 --> 00:26:37,887
You told us that you met your doctor
husband at the university hospital.

439
00:26:38,847 --> 00:26:40,265
Which university?

440
00:26:41,391 --> 00:26:43,476
Did you go to pharmacy school
in the Philippines?

441
00:26:44,686 --> 00:26:45,603
You didn't think

442
00:26:46,104 --> 00:26:48,398
I'd know you went
to high school and college there?

443
00:26:48,982 --> 00:26:49,983
I also know that you went

444
00:26:50,066 --> 00:26:52,235
to a community college
that accepts anybody who pays.

445
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:55,864
Pharmacist, my ass. Have some conscience.

446
00:26:57,365 --> 00:26:59,659
Who told you that I went to college
in the Philippines?

447
00:26:59,743 --> 00:27:02,370
I'm pretty sure that everyone knows.
Don't you all know about it?

448
00:27:02,537 --> 00:27:03,747
Please. That's enough.

449
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:05,040
-Excuse me!
-Yes.

450
00:27:05,498 --> 00:27:07,709
I don't think we can eat today.
Please cancel our orders.

451
00:27:07,792 --> 00:27:09,169
But we already started making them.

452
00:27:09,252 --> 00:27:10,378
Did my husband tell you?

453
00:27:10,712 --> 00:27:12,380
Did Seong-su tell you that? Answer me.

454
00:27:14,090 --> 00:27:15,759
Is he good in bed?

455
00:27:16,801 --> 00:27:18,970
-Where do you think you're going?
-Put this down, please.

456
00:27:19,054 --> 00:27:20,138
Why are you being like this?

457
00:27:20,347 --> 00:27:23,683
What? Did your abusive husband
make you miss being with a sweet guy?

458
00:27:23,892 --> 00:27:25,143
Is that why you seduced my husband?

459
00:27:25,226 --> 00:27:26,603
That's right. I seduced him.

460
00:27:27,145 --> 00:27:29,397
He's sweet and he said
that he's crazy about me.

461
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:30,482
That's why I fell for him.

462
00:27:32,901 --> 00:27:34,319
Gyeong-hui, just get out of here.

463
00:27:34,819 --> 00:27:37,155
No, I won't. Bring it on.

464
00:27:37,364 --> 00:27:39,741
What is wrong with you?
You're in no position to be provoking her.

465
00:27:39,824 --> 00:27:41,534
Gyeong-hui, don't be like this.

466
00:27:41,951 --> 00:27:43,328
Cut it out, okay?

467
00:27:43,411 --> 00:27:45,413
You're in no position to be lecturing me.
Aren't I right?

468
00:27:45,497 --> 00:27:47,207
-You know that I'm right.
-What did you say?

469
00:27:47,916 --> 00:27:49,834
You fell for him because
he's crazy about you?

470
00:27:49,918 --> 00:27:53,338
That's right. He told me
that I smell like cherry blossom.

471
00:27:53,463 --> 00:27:55,256
He said he feels pure in heart
when he sees me

472
00:27:55,382 --> 00:27:56,925
and that I make him feel like a man.

473
00:28:01,388 --> 00:28:02,764
Gosh, you crazy...

474
00:28:44,472 --> 00:28:46,141
Stop!

475
00:28:46,474 --> 00:28:49,394
I'm pregnant!

476
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:51,312
I'm pregnant!

477
00:28:57,152 --> 00:28:58,278
Get off me!

478
00:29:18,173 --> 00:29:19,257
That day

479
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:24,220
at their last brunch together,
she got a good look at her reality.

480
00:29:24,554 --> 00:29:27,515
She also saw what she should be doing,

481
00:29:28,183 --> 00:29:31,436
but absolutely must not do
at the same time.

482
00:29:31,853 --> 00:29:34,898
Here at Hanguk University's
Global Education Center,

483
00:29:35,231 --> 00:29:38,026
our goal is to cultivate global leaders
with the power and ability

484
00:29:38,485 --> 00:29:40,111
to transform the economic uncertainty

485
00:29:40,528 --> 00:29:42,572
that has prevailed all over the globe

486
00:29:42,864 --> 00:29:45,158
into golden opportunities.

487
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:49,788
Hello.

488
00:29:50,246 --> 00:29:52,707
I'm Min-gi Han, the CEO of MK Capital.

489
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:54,626
My name is Bok...

490
00:29:56,503 --> 00:29:59,214
I'm Ji-yeong Park.

491
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:01,508
-I see, Ms. Ji-yeong Park.
-Yes.

492
00:30:01,716 --> 00:30:02,717
Do you have a business card?

493
00:30:03,927 --> 00:30:05,637
I'll give it to you in the next class.

494
00:30:13,311 --> 00:30:17,148
This wine was produced
in the Chianti region in Tuscany, Italy.

495
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:18,775
It was made by Zonin.

496
00:30:19,108 --> 00:30:20,318
The name of this wine is

497
00:30:20,527 --> 00:30:23,613
Castello d'Albola
Chianti Classico Riserva.

498
00:30:25,073 --> 00:30:26,783
-It's hard to remember, isn't it?
-Yes.

499
00:30:26,908 --> 00:30:28,201
Please repeat after me.

500
00:30:28,743 --> 00:30:31,579
-Castello d'Albola.
-Castello d'Albola.

501
00:30:31,663 --> 00:30:34,666
Those in the upper class
studied ceaselessly.

502
00:30:34,999 --> 00:30:38,086
They put in their utmost effort
in order to maintain

503
00:30:38,294 --> 00:30:39,754
their social status

504
00:30:40,171 --> 00:30:42,382
and the effort they made
was on another level

505
00:30:42,465 --> 00:30:45,343
compared to the lower class' effort
for survival.

506
00:30:46,678 --> 00:30:48,012
They believed

507
00:30:48,513 --> 00:30:52,183
that all of their endeavors
will ensure their survival

508
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:54,894
even if their lives were to crumble.

509
00:31:07,782 --> 00:31:08,783
I'm sorry.

510
00:31:08,867 --> 00:31:10,243
Please continue with the consultation.

511
00:31:26,342 --> 00:31:28,094
When would you like to book...

512
00:31:33,224 --> 00:31:34,267
Is it your child?

513
00:31:35,018 --> 00:31:36,019
It's not, right?

514
00:31:36,769 --> 00:31:37,729
I don't know.

515
00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:41,441
-What?
-I don't know either. I'm going crazy.

516
00:31:41,524 --> 00:31:42,692
Why are you going crazy?

517
00:31:43,484 --> 00:31:46,321
Because it might be yours? Or are you
afraid that it may not be yours?

518
00:31:46,404 --> 00:31:48,573
-What do you think?
-You fucking son of a bitch...

519
00:31:49,991 --> 00:31:51,200
How...

520
00:31:51,826 --> 00:31:53,661
can you stab me in the back like this?

521
00:31:53,912 --> 00:31:55,747
I'm sorry. I was going to end it.

522
00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:57,040
Did you love her?

523
00:31:57,624 --> 00:31:58,625
Love, my foot.

524
00:31:58,958 --> 00:32:01,753
What was it, then? You cheated on me
with someone you don't even love?

525
00:32:02,003 --> 00:32:04,213
We met her through our son,
for God's sake.

526
00:32:04,881 --> 00:32:08,593
You should've done it with some bar girl
so that I'd never find out!

527
00:32:08,843 --> 00:32:10,511
We met as a doctor and a patient first.

528
00:32:11,095 --> 00:32:12,847
I was happy to see her again
at the get-together.

529
00:32:17,226 --> 00:32:18,561
You were happy to see her again?

530
00:32:19,145 --> 00:32:21,147
How dare you say that to my face?

531
00:32:21,314 --> 00:32:23,775
Let's talk at home. This is my workplace.
This looks really bad.

532
00:32:23,858 --> 00:32:25,610
You at least know
that you should be embarrassed.

533
00:32:25,693 --> 00:32:27,445
That's why I'm holding back.

534
00:32:27,946 --> 00:32:29,989
I want to rip you to pieces right now,

535
00:32:30,907 --> 00:32:32,492
but you have to see your patients

536
00:32:32,784 --> 00:32:34,953
in order for us to raise Jeong-woo
in a good environment

537
00:32:35,536 --> 00:32:37,664
and send Jeong-hyeon to a school abroad!

538
00:32:38,206 --> 00:32:40,875
That's exactly it! I'm nothing
but a money-making machine to you.

539
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:43,127
What am I to you? What am I to our family?

540
00:32:43,211 --> 00:32:44,671
I perform the same surgery all day long.

541
00:32:44,754 --> 00:32:46,798
I studied so hard to get into
and finish medical school.

542
00:32:46,881 --> 00:32:50,009
Now, I'm working like a dog to give you
and our sons a comfortable life.

543
00:32:50,093 --> 00:32:52,720
Let me get away with this much at least!

544
00:32:53,513 --> 00:32:55,181
I'm going to stop here. You should go.

545
00:33:04,148 --> 00:33:05,233
AGREEMENT TO WITHDRAW CHARGES

546
00:33:05,316 --> 00:33:07,402
Why did you decide to drop the charges
all of a sudden?

547
00:33:13,741 --> 00:33:16,828
Can a woman file charges
against her husband for hitting her?

548
00:33:16,911 --> 00:33:20,999
Of course. The Women and Youth Bureau
deals with such cases, not us.

549
00:33:25,586 --> 00:33:27,088
Complainant Bong-sik Kim

550
00:33:32,635 --> 00:33:33,886
Gosh, that prick.

551
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:36,764
He must think he can be that arrogant
because he's rich.

552
00:33:37,306 --> 00:33:38,975
I bet he hit his wife.

553
00:33:39,892 --> 00:33:41,227
I'm 100% sure.

554
00:33:43,438 --> 00:33:45,231
Jeez, what a jerk.

555
00:33:48,443 --> 00:33:51,654
My baby is okay, right?

556
00:33:52,572 --> 00:33:53,823
Yes, of course.

557
00:33:56,743 --> 00:33:58,661
You said that your son is
in the grade three.

558
00:33:59,579 --> 00:34:01,789
I have no doubt that he'll be
a great big brother.

559
00:34:19,057 --> 00:34:20,683
Hey, what happened to your face?

560
00:34:21,392 --> 00:34:23,019
Your wife did this to me.

561
00:34:23,269 --> 00:34:26,355
You need to fix this
because your wife made me like this.

562
00:34:26,606 --> 00:34:28,524
Show me. Did she scratch your face
with her nails?

563
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,113
What? It's a burn.

564
00:34:34,614 --> 00:34:35,907
What if it scars?

565
00:34:36,908 --> 00:34:38,117
This won't scar.

566
00:34:38,326 --> 00:34:40,536
I'll give you an ointment.
Make sure you apply it religiously.

567
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:44,791
Thank goodness you're a plastic surgeon.

568
00:34:46,959 --> 00:34:47,835
I'm sorry.

569
00:34:49,045 --> 00:34:52,173
Whom do you feel more apologetic toward?

570
00:34:52,632 --> 00:34:54,133
Me or your wife?

571
00:34:57,303 --> 00:34:58,179
Seong-su.

572
00:34:59,013 --> 00:35:01,432
Take responsibility for what you've done.

573
00:35:03,267 --> 00:35:04,227
Are you scared?

574
00:35:05,686 --> 00:35:07,063
What are you talking about?

575
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:09,565
We don't even know
whether the baby is mine or not.

576
00:35:09,649 --> 00:35:10,733
It is yours.

577
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:13,361
My husband and I don't have sex.

578
00:35:15,488 --> 00:35:16,364
Are you serious?

579
00:35:16,614 --> 00:35:17,949
What should I do now?

580
00:35:28,835 --> 00:35:30,336
Please be careful with them.

581
00:35:30,711 --> 00:35:32,255
Those paintings are at least

582
00:35:32,338 --> 00:35:34,006
ten times more expensive than
furniture pieces,

583
00:35:34,090 --> 00:35:35,383
so please be very gentle.

584
00:35:35,591 --> 00:35:37,426
-No problem.
-You be careful too, okay?

585
00:35:58,739 --> 00:36:01,117
You may find it hard to believe,

586
00:36:01,826 --> 00:36:03,244
but I like you, A-jin.

587
00:36:05,413 --> 00:36:07,874
Yes, I do find that hard to believe.

588
00:36:10,543 --> 00:36:11,627
Shall we clink our glasses?

589
00:36:19,302 --> 00:36:21,971
In life, we encounter many things

590
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:25,766
that we have no control over.

591
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:28,728
Actually, we rarely encounter things
that we can control

592
00:36:29,353 --> 00:36:30,730
in life.

593
00:36:30,813 --> 00:36:32,607
Is your husband one of those things?

594
00:36:39,864 --> 00:36:42,366
I guess you're just going to let it slide.

595
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:46,204
You said you guys will move out.
Isn't that what it means?

596
00:36:47,330 --> 00:36:49,332
I'm assuming that Jae-seok
will move out with you.

597
00:36:51,459 --> 00:36:53,211
I no longer consider him my husband,

598
00:36:54,086 --> 00:36:56,756
but Ji-hu still needs a dad.

599
00:37:00,092 --> 00:37:02,887
He also said that he won't get divorced.

600
00:37:03,512 --> 00:37:05,389
He told Mr. Chairman

601
00:37:06,015 --> 00:37:08,100
that he'll never get divorced.

602
00:37:09,518 --> 00:37:10,645
Does Father know about it too?

603
00:37:12,021 --> 00:37:13,314
I told him.

604
00:37:14,607 --> 00:37:16,692
It's not something
that we should keep from him.

605
00:37:23,366 --> 00:37:24,492
Why are you drinking?

606
00:37:25,201 --> 00:37:27,662
And you should have told me
if you wanted to drink. Why...

607
00:37:27,745 --> 00:37:29,455
Do you want to ask
why she's drinking with me?

608
00:37:31,082 --> 00:37:32,375
Is something going on, A-jin?

609
00:37:32,708 --> 00:37:35,378
-No, Ju-mi.
-Just go to your room.

610
00:37:35,836 --> 00:37:37,255
The two of us have things to talk about.

611
00:37:42,343 --> 00:37:45,471
-Goodness.
-Who's calling? Your wife?

612
00:37:46,806 --> 00:37:47,932
No, it's my dad.

613
00:37:48,474 --> 00:37:51,644
My old man makes me laugh.
I mean, he used to be a total womanizer.

614
00:37:51,769 --> 00:37:54,480
How can he criticize me
and hit me like that?

615
00:37:54,897 --> 00:37:58,025
Just pick up.
We need your father on our side.

616
00:38:02,488 --> 00:38:03,864
You better come home right now!

617
00:38:04,865 --> 00:38:05,950
You crazy bastard.

618
00:38:06,492 --> 00:38:09,203
Did I tell you to end it
with that girl or not?

619
00:38:09,537 --> 00:38:12,373
Don't you know that your mom died young
because I philandered around

620
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:14,166
and broke her heart all her life?

621
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:15,793
How can I not know that?

622
00:38:16,002 --> 00:38:17,753
Then how can you do that to your wife?

623
00:38:17,837 --> 00:38:19,422
I didn't learn any better.

624
00:38:19,505 --> 00:38:22,883
You deserve to be beaten up to a pulp.
You're just so pathetic.

625
00:38:23,259 --> 00:38:26,762
What are you going to do
if A-jin falls ill and dies young?

626
00:38:27,013 --> 00:38:28,681
Don't you worry, Dad.

627
00:38:29,223 --> 00:38:32,184
If that happens, I'll hire a caregiver
and marry her like what you did.

628
00:38:32,393 --> 00:38:34,437
What? What did you just say?

629
00:38:35,021 --> 00:38:37,148
You've completely lost your mind.

630
00:38:37,898 --> 00:38:41,068
How dare you blabber away like that?

631
00:38:41,402 --> 00:38:45,823
I heard that A-jin was the one
who introduced that cartoonist to you.

632
00:38:46,449 --> 00:38:48,534
How can you have an affair
with that woman?

633
00:38:48,951 --> 00:38:50,119
Dad.

634
00:38:50,494 --> 00:38:53,831
She's not a cartoonist. How many times
do I have to tell you that it's pop art?

635
00:38:53,914 --> 00:38:54,957
You know what?

636
00:38:55,458 --> 00:38:58,294
I at least found my women myself
when I philandered around.

637
00:38:58,461 --> 00:38:59,712
I never got your mom involved.

638
00:39:00,296 --> 00:39:02,131
I made the effort myself.

639
00:39:02,423 --> 00:39:06,010
You're such a loser even in the way
you cheat on your wife.

640
00:39:06,218 --> 00:39:07,511
You moron.

641
00:39:07,928 --> 00:39:10,056
You even need A-jin's help
to cheat on her.

642
00:39:10,389 --> 00:39:11,265
Dad.

643
00:39:11,515 --> 00:39:14,352
I'm confident that I can persuade you
when I talk to you in person,

644
00:39:14,435 --> 00:39:17,188
so don't go overboard unless you want
to embarrass yourself then.

645
00:39:17,271 --> 00:39:18,522
Why are you overreacting like this?

646
00:39:18,689 --> 00:39:19,690
Shut up, you punk.

647
00:39:20,358 --> 00:39:23,027
I'm going to give you exactly one week.

648
00:39:23,235 --> 00:39:27,031
If you continue seeing her after that,
I'll kick you out of the company for good.

649
00:39:27,239 --> 00:39:28,074
You got that?

650
00:39:38,042 --> 00:39:39,960
What is his point?

651
00:39:40,419 --> 00:39:42,880
Is he saying I should philander
through my own effort from now on?

652
00:39:43,255 --> 00:39:45,299
No one can talk nonsense like he does.

653
00:39:45,466 --> 00:39:46,425
What did he say?

654
00:39:46,592 --> 00:39:48,219
He obviously wants me
to come home right away.

655
00:39:48,552 --> 00:39:49,678
Then you should go home now.

656
00:39:50,346 --> 00:39:52,556
-Why?
-You need to obey your father.

657
00:39:52,807 --> 00:39:55,017
Can't you tell from what
your stepmother did to me?

658
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:57,645
Your father is furious right now.

659
00:39:57,853 --> 00:39:59,855
You might actually get
kicked out of the company.

660
00:40:00,356 --> 00:40:01,732
If it happens, it happens.

661
00:40:02,483 --> 00:40:03,359
That's crazy.

662
00:40:03,776 --> 00:40:05,444
Have you lost your mind or what?

663
00:40:05,611 --> 00:40:07,863
Hey, I'm feeling a little disappointed
in you right now.

664
00:40:08,489 --> 00:40:10,366
Had I been poor,
would you not have loved me?

665
00:40:11,242 --> 00:40:12,993
Things like that don't even
mean anything now.

666
00:40:13,244 --> 00:40:16,163
I like everything that makes
who you are now.

667
00:40:16,664 --> 00:40:18,916
You asked me if I wouldn't have loved you
had you been poor.

668
00:40:19,083 --> 00:40:20,918
My answer is neither yes nor no.

669
00:40:21,001 --> 00:40:22,044
Don't be so childish.

670
00:40:22,878 --> 00:40:25,297
So, are you saying
that I should go home right now?

671
00:40:25,506 --> 00:40:28,717
Don't make the situation worse.
Try to be mature about things, please.

672
00:40:29,093 --> 00:40:30,845
You're not an adolescent.

673
00:40:30,928 --> 00:40:31,762
Hey.

674
00:40:31,846 --> 00:40:34,598
I wouldn't have gotten involved with you
if I had been a mature person.

675
00:40:41,814 --> 00:40:44,483
Do you know
what my least favorite number is?

676
00:40:46,652 --> 00:40:47,528
Nine.

677
00:40:48,529 --> 00:40:49,488
It's nine.

678
00:40:50,573 --> 00:40:51,782
Do you know why?

679
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:58,289
It's because I lost my dad
when I was nine.

680
00:41:00,499 --> 00:41:02,418
My daughter, Ji-hu...

681
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:06,213
I don't want her to hate

682
00:41:07,465 --> 00:41:09,216
the number, 11.

683
00:41:16,474 --> 00:41:17,933
Divorcing him

684
00:41:18,726 --> 00:41:21,645
doesn't mean that Ji-hu will lose her dad.

685
00:41:23,105 --> 00:41:24,064
You're wrong.

686
00:41:25,274 --> 00:41:27,568
The sense of loss that she'll feel

687
00:41:28,944 --> 00:41:33,199
won't be anything different
from what I felt at the age of nine.

688
00:41:33,991 --> 00:41:35,034
Perhaps,

689
00:41:37,077 --> 00:41:38,871
she may end up with a deeper scar

690
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:43,959
because she'll feel betrayed
on top of having to deal

691
00:41:45,961 --> 00:41:47,463
with the sense of loss.

692
00:42:16,575 --> 00:42:18,744
I guess Dad does pity me after all.

693
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:20,913
He gave me some money
when he was kicking me out.

694
00:42:21,705 --> 00:42:23,207
Then are you planning

695
00:42:23,374 --> 00:42:25,876
to stay here until Mr. Chairman decides

696
00:42:26,126 --> 00:42:27,753
to give you a load of money?

697
00:42:27,962 --> 00:42:28,879
Of course.

698
00:42:29,338 --> 00:42:31,340
I'll be glued here
like a piece of wet toilet paper

699
00:42:31,423 --> 00:42:32,925
stuck on the bathroom floor.

700
00:42:33,509 --> 00:42:34,760
How much do you want?

701
00:42:35,177 --> 00:42:36,178
Two billion won in cash.

702
00:42:36,845 --> 00:42:38,430
I'll move out if he gives me that much,

703
00:42:39,306 --> 00:42:41,767
but I'll still need to talk to him
about my inheritance and shares.

704
00:42:43,686 --> 00:42:44,603
Oh, hey.

705
00:42:45,104 --> 00:42:48,274
Fill up the bathtub with hot water for me
before you leave.

706
00:42:49,275 --> 00:42:50,526
Do it yourself.

707
00:42:52,736 --> 00:42:55,739
Gosh, seriously.
Everyone thinks I'm a joke.

708
00:43:06,917 --> 00:43:07,793
Are you asleep?

709
00:43:37,573 --> 00:43:38,616
Look who's here.

710
00:43:41,535 --> 00:43:42,745
Everyone, come out!

711
00:43:43,746 --> 00:43:44,747
Come out!

712
00:43:45,748 --> 00:43:46,749
Where did everyone go?

713
00:43:52,212 --> 00:43:53,589
What brings you here?

714
00:44:00,137 --> 00:44:01,472
Go ahead and tell us why you're here.

715
00:44:01,764 --> 00:44:03,807
You were lurking around our house.

716
00:44:05,684 --> 00:44:07,019
I'm actually here

717
00:44:08,145 --> 00:44:10,105
to apologize to you, Mr. Chairman.

718
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:12,775
For what?

719
00:44:14,610 --> 00:44:18,238
The canopy that collapsed
at your birthday party...

720
00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:21,492
I was there when that happened.

721
00:44:22,034 --> 00:44:22,951
You were?

722
00:44:23,452 --> 00:44:25,079
Why didn't you come and say hello to me?

723
00:44:26,789 --> 00:44:30,209
I was there to hurt Ms. Bok-ja Park,
who is your wife now.

724
00:44:35,005 --> 00:44:38,217
I did what I was told to do
because I got paid.

725
00:44:38,592 --> 00:44:41,220
What? What are you talking about now?

726
00:44:41,637 --> 00:44:43,722
Let's hear him out, Honey.

727
00:44:45,349 --> 00:44:47,434
I have some debts to pay off.

728
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:50,896
That's why I couldn't refuse
such a crazy request.

729
00:44:51,855 --> 00:44:53,023
I'm sorry, sir.

730
00:44:54,566 --> 00:44:55,651
Goodness.

731
00:44:56,527 --> 00:44:58,237
I'm not following at all.

732
00:44:58,320 --> 00:44:59,613
One day, your eldest son's wife...

733
00:45:00,781 --> 00:45:02,324
I mean, this lady here

734
00:45:03,742 --> 00:45:06,203
visited me at the gym and gave me
an envelope with cash inside.

735
00:45:06,995 --> 00:45:07,871
What?

736
00:45:11,417 --> 00:45:12,835
Father, that is not true.

737
00:45:13,085 --> 00:45:14,294
Let's hear him out first.

738
00:45:14,461 --> 00:45:16,839
She said this person she hates
is giving her murderous thoughts

739
00:45:17,339 --> 00:45:18,632
and that she wants to sabotage her.

740
00:45:20,134 --> 00:45:21,635
"Sabotage"? What do you mean by that?

741
00:45:22,594 --> 00:45:23,512
Just enough...

742
00:45:24,721 --> 00:45:26,640
to make sure she can
no longer work as a caregiver.

743
00:45:26,723 --> 00:45:28,392
What exactly did she tell you to do?

744
00:45:28,475 --> 00:45:29,643
Shut your mouth!

745
00:45:30,018 --> 00:45:31,603
I've never even met you.

746
00:45:32,396 --> 00:45:34,857
Father, he's framing me.
I never did such a thing.

747
00:45:34,940 --> 00:45:37,317
-She told me to hurt her.
-What?

748
00:45:37,401 --> 00:45:38,902
Holy shit.

749
00:45:38,986 --> 00:45:42,114
I've been feeling terribly guilty
because I did it for money.

750
00:45:43,407 --> 00:45:44,366
I'm sorry.

751
00:45:46,577 --> 00:45:47,828
He's putting on a show, Father.

752
00:45:48,620 --> 00:45:50,998
I bet he's colluding with this woman.

753
00:45:51,331 --> 00:45:52,666
She's the mastermind behind it.

754
00:45:52,749 --> 00:45:55,502
Shut up! How dare you spew such nonsense?

755
00:45:56,003 --> 00:45:57,212
Ju-mi.

756
00:45:57,421 --> 00:46:00,591
I get that you feel cornered,
but you can't falsely accuse me like that.

757
00:46:01,341 --> 00:46:03,719
Honey. I'm okay,

758
00:46:04,178 --> 00:46:05,971
so let's not make a fuss about this.

759
00:46:06,388 --> 00:46:09,892
We should let him go.
We can talk about it after he leaves.

760
00:46:11,894 --> 00:46:14,521
I can't believe you're doing this.

761
00:46:19,485 --> 00:46:21,069
It's not true, Father!

762
00:46:21,153 --> 00:46:22,196
Shut your mouth!

763
00:46:27,993 --> 00:46:28,827
A-jin.

764
00:46:29,453 --> 00:46:30,370
A-jin!

765
00:46:32,998 --> 00:46:35,334
-It's a total disaster over there.
-What's happening now?

766
00:46:35,417 --> 00:46:37,794
Ju-mi, Jae-gu, and Un-gyu
are about to get kicked out.

767
00:46:38,921 --> 00:46:41,882
-By the way, do you really have to move?
-Why do you ask?

768
00:46:41,965 --> 00:46:43,800
Where will they go if they get kicked out?

769
00:46:44,009 --> 00:46:46,011
They should go stay at the place
you bought at least.

770
00:46:46,094 --> 00:46:48,055
Jae-hui,
I really can't let them stay there.

771
00:46:48,931 --> 00:46:50,265
Father, it's not true.

772
00:46:50,390 --> 00:46:52,684
I really didn't do it.
Why would I do such a thing?

773
00:46:52,768 --> 00:46:55,479
The one whom you paid came forward
because he felt too guilty.

774
00:46:55,687 --> 00:46:57,689
How dare you lie to my face? Get out!

775
00:46:58,482 --> 00:47:00,108
-We'll move out.
-Are you out of your mind?

776
00:47:00,359 --> 00:47:02,903
Do you even know what I put up with
in this house while you were gone?

777
00:47:02,986 --> 00:47:04,029
Think about Un-gyu.

778
00:47:06,698 --> 00:47:10,327
Father, Un-gyu is in grade 12 now.

779
00:47:10,786 --> 00:47:12,621
You're fond of him.

780
00:47:13,121 --> 00:47:14,623
Please think about him and...

781
00:47:14,748 --> 00:47:17,376
Then, I'll wait until Un-gyu graduates...

782
00:47:18,293 --> 00:47:21,296
No, I'll let you guys stay
just until his college entrance exam.

783
00:47:22,714 --> 00:47:25,008
I want you guys gone after that.
I can't stand any of you.

784
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:35,435
Your father

785
00:47:36,436 --> 00:47:38,438
gave your brother shit
for having an affair

786
00:47:39,648 --> 00:47:42,067
because he didn't want A-jin
to be heartbroken.

787
00:47:46,113 --> 00:47:48,574
But he's kicking me out without even
giving me a chance to explain.

788
00:47:51,410 --> 00:47:52,536
I can't believe this.

789
00:47:54,746 --> 00:47:57,249
This is all your fault.
Do you realize that?

790
00:48:25,027 --> 00:48:27,446
-I have the sales report here.
-All right.

791
00:48:32,868 --> 00:48:35,537
Mr. Ahn. Where are you going?
I should be leaving.

792
00:48:35,829 --> 00:48:37,247
Oh, you're right.

793
00:48:38,498 --> 00:48:40,208
Sit. Let's talk.

794
00:48:44,921 --> 00:48:46,298
What brings you here?

795
00:48:46,632 --> 00:48:48,592
I was just at UN Top Village.

796
00:48:49,885 --> 00:48:51,762
-Why did you go there?
-I want to move.

797
00:48:52,512 --> 00:48:53,972
Why do you want to move all of a sudden?

798
00:48:54,097 --> 00:48:54,931
"All of a sudden"?

799
00:48:55,474 --> 00:48:57,225
I'd move out of this country if I could.

800
00:48:57,726 --> 00:49:00,687
I can't go on like this for Ji-hu's sake.

801
00:49:01,938 --> 00:49:06,276
I wanted to move there
and get a fresh start,

802
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:07,194
but...

803
00:49:08,904 --> 00:49:10,280
The passcode has been changed.

804
00:49:12,991 --> 00:49:14,076
I rented it out.

805
00:49:14,993 --> 00:49:18,330
-What?
-I didn't know that you wanted to move.

806
00:49:18,705 --> 00:49:20,457
How can you rent it out
without even asking me?

807
00:49:20,582 --> 00:49:21,541
Have you lost your mind?

808
00:49:26,546 --> 00:49:27,381
What is it?

809
00:49:29,091 --> 00:49:30,300
Tell me the truth.

810
00:49:30,926 --> 00:49:31,927
What did you do?

811
00:49:35,389 --> 00:49:37,224
-I'll kill you!
-No, A-jin!

812
00:49:37,474 --> 00:49:40,143
-Gosh, A-jin. Stop!
-Die.

813
00:49:40,227 --> 00:49:42,062
Don't kill me. Hey! Don't. A-jin, please.

814
00:49:42,145 --> 00:49:43,313
-How could you...
-A-jin!

815
00:49:43,772 --> 00:49:46,191
Come again? Who are you going
to live with at that house?

816
00:49:46,274 --> 00:49:47,317
How could you?

817
00:49:47,734 --> 00:49:49,528
A-jin, please don't kill me.

818
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:51,947
A-jin! Gosh.

819
00:49:58,453 --> 00:50:00,789
Ms. Woo, I have nothing to do with this.

820
00:50:01,123 --> 00:50:04,251
I don't even know
why I'm running away right now!

821
00:50:04,543 --> 00:50:06,545
Please believe me!

822
00:50:34,740 --> 00:50:36,783
Why do you look so distraught?

823
00:50:39,870 --> 00:50:41,413
Where's Mr. Kang?

824
00:50:41,496 --> 00:50:42,497
He's at the court now.

825
00:50:46,585 --> 00:50:48,211
I'm here for a consultation.

826
00:50:51,173 --> 00:50:53,216
To change the ownership
of a real estate property

827
00:50:53,425 --> 00:50:55,385
under my husband's name...

828
00:50:56,553 --> 00:50:57,763
Well, I mean...

829
00:51:00,557 --> 00:51:03,185
Right now,

830
00:51:04,644 --> 00:51:07,147
my husband is living there
with another woman...

831
00:51:11,777 --> 00:51:14,404
He's currently living there
with another woman.

832
00:51:16,656 --> 00:51:18,074
If I want to change the ownership...

833
00:51:20,243 --> 00:51:21,369
I mean...

834
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:25,207
We bought that house

835
00:51:27,209 --> 00:51:28,460
for our daughter

836
00:51:29,795 --> 00:51:31,213
and the two of us...

837
00:51:42,474 --> 00:51:43,892
Please calm down.

838
00:51:50,273 --> 00:51:51,274
I'm sorry.

839
00:51:53,276 --> 00:51:57,197
I came here to get some advice
because I was so frustrated.

840
00:52:00,492 --> 00:52:01,868
I'll come back another time.

841
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:21,763
Going up.

842
00:52:43,410 --> 00:52:44,244
A-jin.

843
00:52:44,619 --> 00:52:45,495
A-jin!

844
00:52:46,913 --> 00:52:47,747
A-jin.

845
00:53:10,604 --> 00:53:12,063
Don't get up.

846
00:53:12,439 --> 00:53:13,523
I'm okay.

847
00:53:13,607 --> 00:53:15,775
That's not for you to decide.

848
00:53:16,234 --> 00:53:18,820
The doctor wants you to move to the ward
to run a few tests.

849
00:53:19,362 --> 00:53:20,530
You also need to get some rest.

850
00:53:20,780 --> 00:53:22,782
It's all right. I'm just going to go home.

851
00:53:22,866 --> 00:53:25,744
You can come to a hospital anytime,
but you can't leave whenever you want

852
00:53:25,827 --> 00:53:27,495
once you're admitted.

853
00:53:28,079 --> 00:53:29,247
I have to go.

854
00:53:29,706 --> 00:53:31,583
Hey, partner.
You need to follow the doctor's orders.

855
00:53:38,924 --> 00:53:42,427
I guess I looked too dashing.

856
00:53:43,261 --> 00:53:44,512
That's probably why you fainted.

857
00:53:46,014 --> 00:53:46,848
I'm sorry.

858
00:53:47,599 --> 00:53:50,101
I'm sorry for looking too dashing
and making you faint.

859
00:53:50,644 --> 00:53:52,187
You have nothing to apologize for.

860
00:53:57,108 --> 00:53:59,277
Well, I need to call my family.

861
00:53:59,861 --> 00:54:00,987
Okay, A-jin.

862
00:54:01,196 --> 00:54:03,740
Don't worry about Ji-hu.
I'll look after her.

863
00:54:05,408 --> 00:54:06,910
What's wrong? What did she say?

864
00:54:08,036 --> 00:54:10,747
A-jin is not feeling well.
She's at a hospital now.

865
00:54:11,331 --> 00:54:12,165
What?

866
00:54:12,874 --> 00:54:15,502
Does that mean she won't come home today?
What does she have?

867
00:54:16,086 --> 00:54:18,630
What do you think? She's heartbroken.

868
00:54:18,922 --> 00:54:20,548
What on earth is happening?

869
00:54:21,591 --> 00:54:23,969
Aunt Jin-hee, I'm done with my homework.

870
00:54:24,552 --> 00:54:26,763
Ji-hu, you should go to bed early today.

871
00:54:26,972 --> 00:54:30,558
Ji-hu, do you happen to know
if your mom and dad

872
00:54:30,642 --> 00:54:32,102
are having problems these days?

873
00:54:32,394 --> 00:54:33,269
Why do you ask?

874
00:54:33,687 --> 00:54:35,939
I'm just wondering
if you've heard anything.

875
00:54:36,022 --> 00:54:37,065
No, I haven't.

876
00:54:37,190 --> 00:54:39,401
For example, anything about your dad
cheating on your mom or...

877
00:54:39,484 --> 00:54:40,944
What are you doing right now?

878
00:54:41,319 --> 00:54:43,363
I just don't understand what's going on.

879
00:54:43,655 --> 00:54:45,865
A-jin called and said
that she's at a hospital out of the blue.

880
00:54:47,784 --> 00:54:49,786
Mom is at a hospital now?

881
00:54:50,161 --> 00:54:51,496
-No...
-Yes.

882
00:55:00,714 --> 00:55:03,425
What did I tell you?
I told you to just hire someone.

883
00:55:03,883 --> 00:55:06,678
Why did you move them by yourself?
That's why you're bedridden like this now.

884
00:55:07,387 --> 00:55:09,305
It's not because I moved my stuff alone.

885
00:55:09,889 --> 00:55:12,851
My body is just starting to ache
from getting assaulted by your stepmother.

886
00:55:15,437 --> 00:55:17,147
Gosh, pick up already.

887
00:55:17,522 --> 00:55:19,149
Okay. It must be my dad.

888
00:55:20,608 --> 00:55:22,277
Oh, gosh. It's Ji-hu.

889
00:55:22,569 --> 00:55:23,945
MY BEAUTIFUL DAUGHTER, TEN MISSED CALLS

890
00:55:31,786 --> 00:55:32,871
Did you talk to your family?

891
00:55:33,371 --> 00:55:34,247
Yes.

892
00:55:38,084 --> 00:55:40,128
Is this your first time
getting hospitalized?

893
00:55:40,879 --> 00:55:42,797
No, it's not.

894
00:55:45,592 --> 00:55:48,553
I got married when I was 25.

895
00:55:49,054 --> 00:55:51,639
My wife and I got into a car accident
on the way to our honeymoon.

896
00:55:52,974 --> 00:55:54,726
After losing my wife like that,

897
00:55:55,602 --> 00:55:59,064
I spent two years at a hospital in a coma.

898
00:55:59,481 --> 00:56:00,982
People call it "vegetative state."

899
00:56:02,025 --> 00:56:04,944
That's the state I was in
throughout the time I was hospitalized.

900
00:56:06,404 --> 00:56:08,865
I lost those two years of my life.

901
00:56:10,158 --> 00:56:12,994
Those years just vanished from my life.

902
00:56:15,163 --> 00:56:16,039
But you know what?

903
00:56:17,332 --> 00:56:18,458
I do remember something.

904
00:56:19,709 --> 00:56:22,045
Even though I was unconscious,

905
00:56:22,587 --> 00:56:24,089
there was a thought

906
00:56:25,173 --> 00:56:27,217
my unconscious self was holding onto.

907
00:56:28,551 --> 00:56:29,511
I remember it.

908
00:56:32,180 --> 00:56:33,890
I thought, "I must live.

909
00:56:36,142 --> 00:56:37,894
For the sake of my wife,

910
00:56:39,104 --> 00:56:40,522
I must survive this."

911
00:56:41,606 --> 00:56:43,525
I had no idea
that she had already passed away.

912
00:56:47,654 --> 00:56:50,740
The earnest determination to survive
in order to keep someone safe

913
00:56:51,866 --> 00:56:53,451
brought me back to life.

914
00:56:56,162 --> 00:56:57,080
You should also

915
00:56:57,872 --> 00:57:01,459
think about those
whom you need to protect.

916
00:57:06,089 --> 00:57:07,048
Give me your hand.

917
00:57:14,639 --> 00:57:17,642
It'll turn into a real crane and fly away.

918
00:57:29,988 --> 00:57:31,197
I have to step out for a minute.

919
00:57:31,614 --> 00:57:33,616
They want me to sign
the admission consent form.

920
00:58:05,273 --> 00:58:06,649
There's only one left now.

921
00:58:07,066 --> 00:58:08,651
What will you do
about the younger son's wife?

922
00:58:17,118 --> 00:58:18,870
HUSBAND

923
00:58:24,209 --> 00:58:26,461
-Hello?
-I heard that you're at a hospital now.

924
00:58:27,253 --> 00:58:28,129
What happened?

925
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:30,006
Where are you now?

926
00:58:30,340 --> 00:58:31,549
What do you think? I'm home.

927
00:58:31,799 --> 00:58:32,759
Which one?

928
00:58:32,967 --> 00:58:33,927
Do you have to ask?

929
00:58:34,594 --> 00:58:35,512
The other one, obviously.

930
00:58:37,180 --> 00:58:39,516
Did you faint
because of what I said earlier?

931
00:58:40,266 --> 00:58:42,060
-What?
-A-jin.

932
00:58:42,644 --> 00:58:44,854
You can't faint like that.

933
00:58:45,188 --> 00:58:47,148
Ji-hu is crying her eyes out
because of you right now.

934
00:58:47,899 --> 00:58:49,484
Why did you have to make her
worry like that?

935
00:58:51,277 --> 00:58:52,612
A-jin, I...

936
00:58:55,615 --> 00:58:57,283
I love you.

937
00:58:58,034 --> 00:59:00,119
It's just that
you're not the only woman I love.

938
00:59:00,203 --> 00:59:02,747
I guess you can say
that it's a problem, but...

939
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:06,084
Anyway, I don't want a divorce.

940
00:59:06,626 --> 00:59:08,086
Try to be cool about it, okay?

941
00:59:08,336 --> 00:59:10,296
Just accept it.

942
00:59:19,180 --> 00:59:20,807
Don't leave Ji-hu alone.

943
00:59:21,933 --> 00:59:22,892
You should go home.

944
00:59:22,976 --> 00:59:24,060
Jae-hui is there.

945
00:59:25,478 --> 00:59:27,397
Don't be like this, please.

946
00:59:28,106 --> 00:59:29,482
Go home to Ji-hu.

947
00:59:30,275 --> 00:59:31,192
Do it for me, please.

948
00:59:31,276 --> 00:59:32,860
Seong-hui is not feeling well.

949
00:59:40,535 --> 00:59:42,203
Hello? Hey...

950
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:46,374
She hangs up on me like this
from time to time.

951
00:59:46,874 --> 00:59:48,876
It's a bad habit.

952
00:59:53,548 --> 00:59:55,008
MY DEAR DAUGHTER

953
00:59:55,800 --> 00:59:58,553
Mom, I love you so much. Cheer up!

954
00:59:59,053 --> 01:00:00,221
Don't be sick.

955
01:00:08,021 --> 01:00:08,980
Jae-seok Ahn.

956
01:00:11,399 --> 01:00:14,360
You're out of my life for good now.

957
01:00:15,528 --> 01:00:17,238
What will you do about the other one?

958
01:00:19,574 --> 01:00:20,533
I won't

959
01:00:23,244 --> 01:00:24,245
touch her.

960
01:00:49,937 --> 01:00:50,813
Let's get divorced.

961
01:00:50,897 --> 01:00:53,316
My wife wants to file for divorce.

962
01:00:53,608 --> 01:00:56,736
-Thank you for your help in advance.
-No problem. I'll do my best.

963
01:00:56,861 --> 01:00:59,030
Is my sunshine
really leaving me like this?

964
01:01:00,448 --> 01:01:03,618
Please continue to update me
on everything Mr. Chairman does.

965
01:01:03,868 --> 01:01:04,786
Of course, ma'am.

966
01:01:05,328 --> 01:01:07,664
Stop it. Why are you doing this?
We've never met before.

967
01:01:08,247 --> 01:01:10,875
Are you going to do as I ask?

968
01:01:11,167 --> 01:01:13,461
The house you two
are living in now is mine.

969
01:01:13,544 --> 01:01:16,047
Ji-hu and I have to move in there,
so you two must move out immediately.

970
01:01:16,130 --> 01:01:17,465
Let's put it under my name.

971
01:01:17,548 --> 01:01:20,885
Only then, your wife won't be able to say
that she'll move in here.

972
01:01:21,386 --> 01:01:24,514
You can't back down.
We're on the edge of a cliff right now.

973
01:01:24,639 --> 01:01:27,600
At least kill that woman before you go.

974
01:01:28,810 --> 01:01:30,937
"Vice-Chairwoman," my ass.

975
01:01:31,437 --> 01:01:33,606
-Jae-gu, don't.
-Mark my words.

976
01:01:33,815 --> 01:01:35,525
I'll kill this bitch today and go to jail.

977
01:01:35,608 --> 01:01:37,694
Kill me!

978
01:01:38,444 --> 01:01:41,239
Are you scared
that I might do something else to you?

979
01:01:44,283 --> 01:01:45,326
VICE-CHAIRWOMAN JI-YEONG PARK

980
01:01:46,035 --> 01:01:48,955
I need to finish what I started.
That's all.

981
01:01:50,832 --> 01:01:52,834
