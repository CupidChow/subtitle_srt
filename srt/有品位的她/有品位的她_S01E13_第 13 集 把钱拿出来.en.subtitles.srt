1
00:00:40,957 --> 00:00:42,542
The divorce documents are registered.

2
00:00:42,625 --> 00:00:44,252
The court will send them to you soon.

3
00:00:44,335 --> 00:00:47,297
I can't abandon my wife and daughter
in any circumstances.

4
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:49,257
-What about me?
-I can't abandon you either.

5
00:00:49,382 --> 00:00:50,717
You greedy jerk.

6
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,761
How can she expect to
hide something like this?

7
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:54,763
How can she think
that I wouldn't find out?

8
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:56,514
So, you were going to stab her...

9
00:00:56,931 --> 00:00:58,516
Did you mean to kill her?

10
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,894
Yes. I did.

11
00:01:01,352 --> 00:01:05,148
I don't know who'll kill you,
but it'll happen sooner or later.

12
00:01:05,231 --> 00:01:07,650
Stop this. Why are you doing this?
You haven't met me before.

13
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:09,611
I am thinking about
how I'm going to use this.

14
00:01:11,112 --> 00:01:12,655
That stupid bastard.

15
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:17,577
Do you think Bok-ja Park
will take care of you forever?

16
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:20,830
How can you prove
that you didn't pay him for that tape?

17
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:22,665
Bok-ja Park is not going to settle.

18
00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:25,960
Even if you divorce Jae-seok,
will you help the company?

19
00:01:26,044 --> 00:01:28,838
We can't help each other.

20
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:33,051
I don't seek what's not mine.

21
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:40,433
Hello?

22
00:01:40,725 --> 00:01:41,601
Ms. Woo.

23
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:43,895
I'm about to leave for the day,

24
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:46,231
but Mr. Ahn just got home.

25
00:01:46,856 --> 00:01:49,192
That girl is here too.
They are in the room together now.

26
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:53,363
Shall I stay and keep an eye on them
until you get home?

27
00:01:53,655 --> 00:01:57,117
You don't need to do that. Just get going.
Thank you for everything.

28
00:02:06,584 --> 00:02:07,585
Mr. Han.

29
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:09,587
I'm coming to see you.

30
00:02:10,046 --> 00:02:10,880
Sure.

31
00:02:11,297 --> 00:02:12,257
See you soon.

32
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:32,819
You moron. What if someone sees you?

33
00:02:33,194 --> 00:02:34,571
Why didn't you pick up?

34
00:02:34,654 --> 00:02:35,905
I was at the hospital.

35
00:02:36,364 --> 00:02:37,198
Get in.

36
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:38,783
Before anyone sees you.

37
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:03,474
Go ahead.

38
00:03:04,475 --> 00:03:05,476
What should we do now?

39
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:08,021
-What do you mean?
-She wants the 100 million won back.

40
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:11,357
I'm in deep shit now. She said
that she'll report me to the police.

41
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:14,027
Use your brain, will you?

42
00:03:14,277 --> 00:03:16,779
All she has is that recording.
Why are you so scared?

43
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:19,782
Just tell the police that you said
those things because she made you to.

44
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:20,867
Why should I?

45
00:03:21,618 --> 00:03:23,661
Why do I have to do that?
Am I your puppet?

46
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:27,415
You are my puppet. Did you think
that you were my business partner or what?

47
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:30,710
I told you to just follow my orders.

48
00:03:31,127 --> 00:03:31,961
You.

49
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:34,964
Just do as I say, okay?

50
00:03:35,757 --> 00:03:37,842
If you don't, you'll be screwed.

51
00:03:38,676 --> 00:03:39,969
Let's be honest here.

52
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:42,889
You don't have any evidence to prove
that I put you up to it.

53
00:03:43,306 --> 00:03:44,140
Bok-ja.

54
00:03:44,974 --> 00:03:46,434
You can't say it like that.

55
00:03:46,517 --> 00:03:48,770
Listen, the best thing you can do now

56
00:03:48,853 --> 00:03:51,648
is keep on being my puppet
and doing a good job at it.

57
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:53,858
Don't be all confused and lame.

58
00:03:54,442 --> 00:03:56,361
You must do as I say if you want to live.

59
00:03:58,988 --> 00:03:59,864
I don't want to.

60
00:04:00,782 --> 00:04:01,658
You don't want to?

61
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:04,410
Show me something concrete
so that I can trust you.

62
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:06,955
What do you want me to show you?

63
00:04:07,038 --> 00:04:07,956
Money.

64
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:11,334
Money?

65
00:04:12,001 --> 00:04:13,461
Yes, I want money.

66
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,302
Do you know what climbing
the social ladder has taught me?

67
00:04:23,012 --> 00:04:24,430
People here have something

68
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:29,102
that those at the bottom of the ladder
cannot emulate. Do you know what it is?

69
00:04:31,562 --> 00:04:32,897
They use their brains.

70
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:36,526
Those who live hand to mouth

71
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:41,030
are only concerned with immediate profit
even if it's not much money at all,

72
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:44,450
but these people here look far ahead

73
00:04:45,618 --> 00:04:47,662
and see the bigger picture
in everything they do.

74
00:04:48,162 --> 00:04:49,831
There is one more thing.
Do you know what it is?

75
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:54,127
They never spend money on useless things.

76
00:04:55,461 --> 00:04:57,213
Why would I spend money on you?

77
00:04:57,755 --> 00:04:59,674
Do you want money?
You've done nothing to earn it.

78
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,968
How dare you try to blackmail me.

79
00:05:03,052 --> 00:05:03,928
Bok-ja.

80
00:05:04,512 --> 00:05:06,347
Wake up, you punk.

81
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:08,224
You should just

82
00:05:08,391 --> 00:05:11,269
keep bumming around in the slums
because it suits you the best.

83
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:14,689
This is precisely
why you can't get out of that hellhole.

84
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:22,113
The 80,000 won you gave me
when I got out of jail.

85
00:05:23,072 --> 00:05:24,699
I'm paying you back with interest.

86
00:05:25,783 --> 00:05:26,909
Go to a sauna or something.

87
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:32,832
What you and I did

88
00:05:32,915 --> 00:05:35,209
are insignificant
in the grand scheme of things.

89
00:05:36,044 --> 00:05:38,046
Are you going to tell
Mr. Chairman everything?

90
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:40,548
Do you think he'll believe you?

91
00:05:42,133 --> 00:05:44,927
No, the table has turned.

92
00:05:46,304 --> 00:05:48,473
People in the top portion of the ladder

93
00:05:49,432 --> 00:05:50,933
are born with different blood.

94
00:05:55,396 --> 00:05:56,481
I'm no longer

95
00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:59,817
the Bok-ja Park you used to know.

96
00:06:08,951 --> 00:06:09,827
Get off.

97
00:06:24,675 --> 00:06:25,551
Get off already.

98
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:28,679
Take a taxi to go home, okay?

99
00:06:41,484 --> 00:06:44,320
Ms. Park, you're now
the vice chairwoman of Daesung Pulp.

100
00:06:44,529 --> 00:06:46,531
Do you know
what's the first step to a fresh start

101
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:48,574
whether it's for someone
who's starting over

102
00:06:48,658 --> 00:06:50,159
or a new administration that's commencing?

103
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:51,536
It's wiping the slate clean.

104
00:06:51,702 --> 00:06:55,081
You must desert your old self
and those whom you used to know.

105
00:06:55,289 --> 00:06:56,374
It's the most crucial step.

106
00:06:56,624 --> 00:07:00,461
You may feel that it's too ruthless
and heartless at times,

107
00:07:00,586 --> 00:07:01,712
but you still have to do it.

108
00:07:02,171 --> 00:07:05,716
Otherwise, your past will bog you down.

109
00:07:29,907 --> 00:07:33,369
What? Are you saying we should live there?

110
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:36,372
Let's go. We won't have to worry
about other people there.

111
00:07:36,664 --> 00:07:37,582
I don't want to.

112
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:41,878
Then, how about we meet up
at that house every morning?

113
00:07:44,672 --> 00:07:46,966
-Are you a pervert?
-I'm not.

114
00:07:47,592 --> 00:07:49,093
I just want to protect our love.

115
00:07:49,177 --> 00:07:51,888
Me too. But how can you suggest
going there if that's the case?

116
00:07:52,096 --> 00:07:53,139
Stop being ridiculous.

117
00:07:55,224 --> 00:07:56,684
Both of you are insane.

118
00:07:57,518 --> 00:07:59,312
-A-jin.
-What is that in the living room?

119
00:07:59,395 --> 00:08:00,980
Who set up that thing in my house?

120
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:03,941
I hate seeing a mess. Don't you know that?

121
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:06,235
-I do.
-You better get rid of it right now.

122
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:10,323
The couch is too uncomfortable,
and I'm not even allowed in Ji-hu's room.

123
00:08:10,615 --> 00:08:11,782
Where am I supposed to sleep?

124
00:08:13,826 --> 00:08:17,413
She could not utter
what was on the tip of her tongue.

125
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:21,292
"Just sleep in this room with that woman."

126
00:08:31,552 --> 00:08:35,640
The body is an amalgamation of sludge
when we're alive,

127
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:39,685
and there's something even more disgusting
and corrosive than undigested food

128
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:41,646
that we have to eliminate.

129
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:43,814
It's emotional sludge.

130
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:22,103
So, what are you going to do?

131
00:09:24,438 --> 00:09:25,356
What about?

132
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:27,233
Are you going to divorce me?

133
00:09:27,775 --> 00:09:28,651
Of course.

134
00:09:29,151 --> 00:09:30,361
I'll just raise the child.

135
00:09:33,614 --> 00:09:35,408
You've been raising my son,

136
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:37,660
so I'll be a father to that baby.

137
00:09:38,369 --> 00:09:39,412
What a surprise.

138
00:09:40,329 --> 00:09:42,164
I would've never imagined
you'd make such a decision.

139
00:09:42,873 --> 00:09:45,251
It actually scares me in a way.

140
00:09:45,334 --> 00:09:47,086
I'm doing it to save myself
from the embarrassment.

141
00:09:47,295 --> 00:09:48,296
It's not for you.

142
00:09:49,505 --> 00:09:52,133
It's obvious
that our relationship is hopeless.

143
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:56,012
You can only be suggesting that
because we don't love each other at all.

144
00:09:56,512 --> 00:09:57,930
That is absolutely crazy.

145
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:00,141
How can we keep on living together?

146
00:10:01,183 --> 00:10:02,518
I want you to keep raising Yun-jae.

147
00:10:02,893 --> 00:10:04,228
You're fond of him.

148
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:08,357
Stop spewing such nonsense.

149
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:11,319
-I will divorce you.
-You can't.

150
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:13,821
All you do is splurge my money.
You can't even do anything else.

151
00:10:14,238 --> 00:10:15,573
How will you sustain yourself?

152
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:17,825
What? Is he well-off?

153
00:10:18,242 --> 00:10:20,578
Hey, I want to know.

154
00:10:21,078 --> 00:10:23,748
That prick who beat me up
at the parking lot.

155
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:26,459
-It's that prick, isn't it?
-Stop calling him a prick.

156
00:10:27,209 --> 00:10:29,211
Also, I will divorce you.

157
00:10:29,795 --> 00:10:31,922
I'll get alimony from you.

158
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:33,424
I've looked into it,

159
00:10:33,591 --> 00:10:36,510
and it seems like I'll get quite a bit
if I apply for a division of property.

160
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:49,857
-Where is Mr. Chairman?
-He's asleep.

161
00:10:51,692 --> 00:10:54,236
-Make me a cup of chrysanthemum tea.
-Sure.

162
00:11:01,369 --> 00:11:03,245
-Everything has been okay, right?
-Yes.

163
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,749
You already know
about the younger son's family moving out.

164
00:11:08,626 --> 00:11:11,420
I know it's late, but congratulations
on becoming the vice chairwoman.

165
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:12,880
Thanks.

166
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:17,968
There's something I heard
when I was at Pung-suk's Kitchen.

167
00:11:18,469 --> 00:11:21,514
Apparently, there's a TCM doctor in Yongin
who makes herbal medicine

168
00:11:21,597 --> 00:11:23,015
that can help you conceive right away.

169
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:26,519
I don't want to get pregnant.

170
00:11:29,814 --> 00:11:30,731
I won't have a baby.

171
00:11:30,898 --> 00:11:32,608
You wanted a baby though.

172
00:11:32,691 --> 00:11:34,068
I had a change of heart.

173
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:37,696
I've found a faster way
than using the baby to cash in.

174
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:41,617
Then, what are your plans afterward?

175
00:11:43,828 --> 00:11:45,371
Don't ask me things like that anymore.

176
00:11:47,415 --> 00:11:48,374
Also,

177
00:11:50,292 --> 00:11:53,003
call me "Ma'am"
even when it's just the two of us.

178
00:11:58,175 --> 00:12:00,094
Thank you for the tea, Ms. Cheon.

179
00:12:13,107 --> 00:12:14,692
MY BEAUTIFUL DAUGHTER

180
00:12:14,775 --> 00:12:17,945
Hi, sweetheart. Do you want
to go on a date with me tomorrow?

181
00:13:19,048 --> 00:13:21,258
Hi, sweetheart. Do you want
to go on a date with me tomorrow?

182
00:13:25,596 --> 00:13:27,765
Why does my dad live his life like that?

183
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,978
Let's go. Let's do this.

184
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:04,593
I'll think about it, Ms. Seo.

185
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:08,305
I've always known that you're different
from other women,

186
00:14:08,597 --> 00:14:10,224
but you really proved it this time.

187
00:14:10,933 --> 00:14:12,685
You're going cold turkey and moving on.

188
00:14:12,893 --> 00:14:15,020
Have you decided
how you'll earn a living from now on?

189
00:14:15,104 --> 00:14:16,355
I'm thinking hard to figure it out.

190
00:14:16,897 --> 00:14:19,525
If that's the case,
you should just work as an art consultant

191
00:14:19,608 --> 00:14:22,611
at the gallery until you decide
what you want to do.

192
00:14:23,737 --> 00:14:27,324
I'm not trying to help you.
I'm doing it for the gallery.

193
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:31,245
All right, I'll do it.
I hope I'll be helpful.

194
00:14:31,412 --> 00:14:32,830
Of course, you will be.

195
00:14:34,081 --> 00:14:35,124
By the way,

196
00:14:35,749 --> 00:14:37,751
the prices of Seong-hui Yun's paintings
have gone up.

197
00:14:39,253 --> 00:14:40,379
That's great.

198
00:14:40,838 --> 00:14:43,966
-Do you think so?
-Yes. I'm very happy for her.

199
00:14:52,141 --> 00:14:53,851
Hello? Ju-mi.

200
00:14:59,189 --> 00:15:00,232
Where's Father?

201
00:15:00,816 --> 00:15:03,402
He went to the hospital
and that woman went into the office.

202
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:05,404
You know she's the vice chairwoman.

203
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:08,741
She left without even eating breakfast,
saying she has to go to the factory.

204
00:15:09,033 --> 00:15:11,869
I'm sorry, Ju-mi. I didn't even
get to say goodbye before I moved out.

205
00:15:11,952 --> 00:15:14,038
Are you closer with that woman now?

206
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:17,958
Why do I have to find out
about your divorce through her?

207
00:15:18,667 --> 00:15:20,002
My feelings are so hurt.

208
00:15:21,712 --> 00:15:23,130
I've been so out of it.

209
00:15:23,714 --> 00:15:25,674
She only found out about it by chance.

210
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:27,843
I didn't tell her.

211
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:32,139
I mean, it's not even good news.
Why would I tell people myself?

212
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:35,476
I'm sorry that I can't be of any help.

213
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:38,062
No one could have helped.

214
00:15:50,699 --> 00:15:53,118
Jae-gu got arrested.

215
00:15:54,995 --> 00:15:57,623
-Why?
-He got in trouble because of that woman.

216
00:15:58,457 --> 00:15:59,625
I heard he attempted to kill her.

217
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:01,919
Things are not looking up

218
00:16:02,211 --> 00:16:03,754
because of the firearm incident
in the past.

219
00:16:06,131 --> 00:16:06,966
A-jin.

220
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:10,094
Help me.

221
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:12,346
Get Jae-gu out of there.

222
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:19,186
I hate myself for having to ask you this.

223
00:16:23,107 --> 00:16:23,941
But

224
00:16:27,152 --> 00:16:28,112
Un-gyu...

225
00:16:31,031 --> 00:16:32,324
I'm so worried about him.

226
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:36,161
I understand
what you're trying to tell me.

227
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:37,746
I'll try talking to her.

228
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:41,792
Thanks, A-jin.

229
00:16:45,337 --> 00:16:47,256
The house feels so empty without you.

230
00:16:48,424 --> 00:16:49,967
I didn't know I'd feel like this.

231
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:55,639
It also breaks my heart
that we won't be a family anymore.

232
00:17:03,355 --> 00:17:04,982
I'm home!

233
00:17:05,899 --> 00:17:08,402
I'm back.

234
00:17:14,575 --> 00:17:16,160
What is going on? Goodness.

235
00:17:18,162 --> 00:17:20,914
VICE-CHAIRWOMAN JI-YEONG PARK

236
00:17:27,921 --> 00:17:30,841
What's the matter? Did you come
all the way here to see me?

237
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:34,762
Did you have a change of heart
by any chance?

238
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:36,680
No, of course not.

239
00:17:37,765 --> 00:17:39,349
I came to ask you a favor.

240
00:17:40,392 --> 00:17:43,020
Please agree to settle with Jae-gu.

241
00:17:43,771 --> 00:17:46,023
Things got out of hand
while I was at the hospital.

242
00:17:46,356 --> 00:17:48,942
I heard that he's now being charged
with attempted murder

243
00:17:49,318 --> 00:17:51,403
because he said himself
that he did intend to kill me.

244
00:17:52,321 --> 00:17:55,657
The problem won't be resolved
even if I decide to settle with him now.

245
00:17:57,159 --> 00:17:58,869
You need to give your statement
as the victim.

246
00:17:59,661 --> 00:18:01,163
You've already been discharged.

247
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:05,084
You said it will take four weeks to heal,
but you got out within a week.

248
00:18:07,294 --> 00:18:09,797
Please tell the police
that such a thing never happened.

249
00:18:09,963 --> 00:18:12,299
Then, he'll be acquitted
for lack of evidence.

250
00:18:12,382 --> 00:18:13,592
Why do I have to do that?

251
00:18:13,675 --> 00:18:15,719
Is there a reason why you shouldn't?

252
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:31,068
There was,

253
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,738
but I'll change my mind

254
00:18:35,906 --> 00:18:37,324
because you persuaded me.

255
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:43,205
Let's see each other
once in a while like this

256
00:18:43,413 --> 00:18:45,040
even after you get divorced.

257
00:18:45,874 --> 00:18:47,668
I'd like that.

258
00:18:49,837 --> 00:18:51,130
Why do I have to do that?

259
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:54,341
Is there a reason why you shouldn't?

260
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:57,803
No, there's none.

261
00:18:58,303 --> 00:18:59,930
Sure, let's do that.

262
00:19:18,115 --> 00:19:19,575
Are you liking the room?

263
00:19:19,867 --> 00:19:20,784
Yes, ma'am.

264
00:19:21,702 --> 00:19:23,620
I'm sorry about that time.

265
00:19:24,705 --> 00:19:25,622
What do you mean?

266
00:19:25,789 --> 00:19:28,750
That time when Mr. Ahn...

267
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:31,295
It's all in the past now.

268
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:33,505
Besides, it was a misunderstanding anyway.

269
00:19:34,298 --> 00:19:36,842
Yes, ma'am. It was a misunderstanding.

270
00:19:36,925 --> 00:19:38,051
Don't worry about it.

271
00:19:39,303 --> 00:19:40,345
Just a moment.

272
00:19:46,435 --> 00:19:47,394
Do you want this?

273
00:19:48,312 --> 00:19:49,396
It's ruby.

274
00:19:50,063 --> 00:19:51,440
I think it will suit you.

275
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:02,201
PETITION
PETITIONER: A-JIN WOO

276
00:20:02,284 --> 00:20:04,328
SUMMONS, NOTICE TO APPEAR
FOR PRETRIAL MEDIATION

277
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:13,003
Mr. Ahn, Ms. Park will go
to the police station and settle the case.

278
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:16,924
Also, the sales have increased drastically
as of late...

279
00:20:17,007 --> 00:20:20,177
Mr. Park, have you ever been divorced?

280
00:20:20,802 --> 00:20:22,512
No, not yet.

281
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:25,015
I'm distraught.

282
00:20:27,351 --> 00:20:28,268
Goodness.

283
00:20:28,769 --> 00:20:30,562
It looks like you'll need a lawyer.

284
00:20:31,104 --> 00:20:32,022
Right?

285
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:46,787
Hello, Mr. Han.

286
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:52,459
Yes. I know it's still early in the day,
but how about we grab a drink at that bar?

287
00:20:55,879 --> 00:20:59,466
People say that you get drunk faster
when you drink in broad daylight.

288
00:20:59,549 --> 00:21:01,468
People need to know when to stop.

289
00:21:02,052 --> 00:21:05,514
Having that ability is important
in order to succeed in this line of work.

290
00:21:05,973 --> 00:21:08,392
Breaking it off. Take what you need
and pull out before it's late.

291
00:21:08,475 --> 00:21:09,685
You need to be good at that.

292
00:21:11,395 --> 00:21:13,522
Take what you need and pull out.

293
00:21:13,772 --> 00:21:15,732
Things are perfect for Daesung Pulp
at the moment.

294
00:21:16,358 --> 00:21:18,610
Also, it'll be easy
since it's still an unlisted company.

295
00:21:19,236 --> 00:21:21,488
Things have been going so well
for them recently

296
00:21:21,905 --> 00:21:23,240
that the stock value has gone up too.

297
00:21:24,157 --> 00:21:26,535
What exactly should I do?

298
00:21:27,244 --> 00:21:29,496
There is a group of ladies
that gather regularly.

299
00:21:29,997 --> 00:21:31,540
They call themselves Seven Princesses.

300
00:21:32,249 --> 00:21:34,751
All the cash in this business
practically belongs to them.

301
00:21:35,419 --> 00:21:39,464
They all started out with the money
from selling their companies as well.

302
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:42,009
I'll help you out.

303
00:21:42,467 --> 00:21:45,804
It wouldn't be bad
to have another princess join them.

304
00:21:48,223 --> 00:21:49,182
Cheers.

305
00:21:57,607 --> 00:21:59,901
My princess.

306
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:02,237
Didn't you miss me?

307
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:10,829
I miss you so much, my princess.

308
00:22:10,912 --> 00:22:12,456
Let's order ice cream first.

309
00:22:13,957 --> 00:22:15,459
I want the one I always get.

310
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:17,586
All right.

311
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:22,674
Ji-hu, I'm sorry.

312
00:22:23,216 --> 00:22:24,092
What for?

313
00:22:24,301 --> 00:22:25,719
For making you this uncomfortable.

314
00:22:33,852 --> 00:22:34,895
No, thanks.

315
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,943
Stop that too.

316
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,244
What is this?

317
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:53,205
Why does this stink so much?

318
00:22:54,206 --> 00:22:55,457
No way. Again?

319
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:57,334
Gosh.

320
00:22:57,709 --> 00:23:00,295
That can't be
unless he has gone completely insane.

321
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:04,966
When you do laundry,
please wash these too.

322
00:23:06,968 --> 00:23:08,678
Are you nuts?

323
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:10,097
Gosh.

324
00:23:14,101 --> 00:23:15,602
Jae-gu, spare me a second.

325
00:23:18,146 --> 00:23:19,064
Get out of my house.

326
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:22,567
Move out with your wife and Un-gyu.
I don't care where you go.

327
00:23:22,692 --> 00:23:24,820
-Why should I move out?
-Don't you know the reason?

328
00:23:25,487 --> 00:23:29,074
I have to keep my wife safe
and you might kill her.

329
00:23:29,783 --> 00:23:31,827
-I'm disowning you as of this moment.
-Dad.

330
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:33,036
Don't even call me your dad!

331
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,329
Mr. Chairman.

332
00:23:36,623 --> 00:23:40,043
Give me half of the company shares.

333
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:42,295
-What did you say?
-I'm going to be blunt.

334
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:46,716
If that woman puts poison in your food
and kills you,

335
00:23:47,217 --> 00:23:48,885
who will inherit everything you have now?

336
00:23:49,052 --> 00:23:52,055
What did you just say? You son of a bitch.

337
00:23:52,139 --> 00:23:54,683
You don't have to think of me as your son.

338
00:23:55,016 --> 00:23:55,892
But you know what?

339
00:23:56,518 --> 00:23:58,895
I have a wife and a son too.

340
00:23:58,979 --> 00:24:01,022
I need to provide for my family.

341
00:24:01,523 --> 00:24:02,482
Give me my shares.

342
00:24:02,899 --> 00:24:03,942
Then, I'll leave.

343
00:24:04,025 --> 00:24:06,278
I'd much rather find
a homeless man on the street

344
00:24:06,903 --> 00:24:08,572
and give him everything I own.

345
00:24:08,864 --> 00:24:11,032
I won't give you a single penny!

346
00:24:11,408 --> 00:24:12,325
You better remember that.

347
00:24:13,618 --> 00:24:16,830
I want you gone from my sight
as of this moment.

348
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:19,332
-Ms. Cheon.
-Yes, sir.

349
00:24:20,417 --> 00:24:22,544
Starting now, don't make any food
for this punk.

350
00:24:23,587 --> 00:24:24,963
And tell Mr. Kim to come here now.

351
00:24:25,172 --> 00:24:26,548
I want to go into the office.

352
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:27,674
Yes, sir.

353
00:24:32,053 --> 00:24:33,430
He's arriving now?

354
00:24:34,014 --> 00:24:35,599
Okay. I get it, Mr. Kim.

355
00:24:38,977 --> 00:24:40,437
This is on me.

356
00:24:48,278 --> 00:24:49,237
Let's pull out now.

357
00:25:09,424 --> 00:25:11,593
There is a group of ladies
that gather regularly.

358
00:25:11,676 --> 00:25:15,722
They all started out with the money
from selling their companies as well.

359
00:25:36,409 --> 00:25:38,203
Ma'am, it's me.

360
00:25:39,204 --> 00:25:41,706
Ma'am, it's me.

361

SUMMONS, NOTICE TO APPEAR
FOR PRETRIAL MEDIATION

362
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:48,964
Mr. Kang, you have a client
for consultation. It's a divorce case.

363
00:25:49,214 --> 00:25:50,131
Okay.

364
00:25:52,717 --> 00:25:54,344
-Welcome.
-Hello.

365
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:01,393
How can I help you?

366
00:26:01,559 --> 00:26:04,354
The situation I'm in is very urgent
and I'm a busy person,

367
00:26:04,437 --> 00:26:06,022
so I thought I should see
a lawyer right away.

PETITION
PETITIONER: A-JIN WOO

RESPONDENT: JAE-SEOK AHN

00:26:15,573 --> 00:26:16,533
"Jae-seok Ahn"?

371
00:26:17,784 --> 00:26:18,743
Mr. Kang.

372
00:26:19,202 --> 00:26:22,122
I came all the way here to meet you
because I heard that you're a true lawyer

373
00:26:22,205 --> 00:26:23,915
who defends the powerless.

374
00:26:24,332 --> 00:26:26,668
I've been backed into a corner.

375
00:26:27,335 --> 00:26:28,169
Well...

376
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:31,172
Why did you want to consult me?

377
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:35,677
I mean, who told you about me?

378
00:26:35,844 --> 00:26:36,928
2 WEEKS AGO

379
00:26:37,012 --> 00:26:38,054
PETITION

380
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:41,016
-Hello, Dr. Jang.
-Hey, Mr. Ahn.

381
00:26:41,266 --> 00:26:43,268
-How have you been?
-I'm not well.

382
00:26:43,852 --> 00:26:44,894
Why? What's going on?

383
00:26:44,978 --> 00:26:48,690
I'm calling because I need
to find a good lawyer.

384
00:26:48,773 --> 00:26:50,984
Our company has a legal advisor
and I know a few lawyers too,

385
00:26:51,151 --> 00:26:54,571
but I'm going through something
a little embarrassing.

386
00:26:54,738 --> 00:26:57,657
I need someone who is discreet
and warmhearted. Most importantly...

387
00:26:58,116 --> 00:27:00,577
Well, someone who can be
on the same page emotionally with me

388
00:27:00,702 --> 00:27:01,953
and lead the conversation.

389
00:27:02,078 --> 00:27:04,205
Someone who's on the same page
as you emotionally.

390
00:27:05,081 --> 00:27:05,915
Hang on, okay?

391
00:27:05,999 --> 00:27:09,336
My eyes are turning back.

392
00:27:09,419 --> 00:27:12,589
A friend of mine is a plastic surgeon.
I'll introduce you to him.

393
00:27:12,714 --> 00:27:15,300
Yes. Please take good care
of her, Dr. Jang.

394
00:27:15,967 --> 00:27:16,968
A lawyer?

395
00:27:17,135 --> 00:27:18,762
-Hello?
-Hey.

396
00:27:18,887 --> 00:27:21,431
Give me that lawyer's number.

397
00:27:22,891 --> 00:27:24,434
The kindhearted lawyer in the area.

398
00:27:25,935 --> 00:27:27,395
-Him?
-Cheers.

399
00:27:27,604 --> 00:27:30,023
Nothing can beat the champagne
we had at the yacht party.

400
00:27:31,483 --> 00:27:34,110
Right. I saw our photos
from the yacht party

401
00:27:34,194 --> 00:27:36,237
on a travel agency's website.

402
00:27:36,321 --> 00:27:38,239
That's copyright infringement.

403
00:27:38,323 --> 00:27:40,575
I know, right? Do you know any lawyers?

404
00:27:40,658 --> 00:27:43,912
I do know a caring, curious lawyer
who takes all cases that come his way.

405
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:45,121
Put me in touch with him.

406
00:27:46,164 --> 00:27:48,541
LAW OFFICE OF GI-HO KANG
GI-HO KANG, ATTORNEY AT LAW

407
00:27:48,625 --> 00:27:51,711
Who told you to consult me?

408
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,963
That's not important.

409
00:27:54,214 --> 00:27:57,634
Mr. Kang, I need a lawyer
who is empathetic enough to understand

410
00:27:57,801 --> 00:28:00,011
and relate to my current emotional state.

411
00:28:00,095 --> 00:28:02,347
Someone who won't try
to make me understand the legal...

412
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:05,225
-In other words...
-Excuse me, Mr. Jae-seok Ahn.

413
00:28:06,059 --> 00:28:10,105
I have no interest in understanding
your current emotional state.

414
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:13,900
First off, I refuse to be
your legal representative.

415
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:15,944
What? Why?

416
00:28:16,653 --> 00:28:18,113
I'm speechless.

417
00:28:19,322 --> 00:28:20,865
-Please leave.
-Look.

418
00:28:20,949 --> 00:28:23,368
You're being ridiculous.
Gosh, I can't believe this.

419
00:28:23,451 --> 00:28:27,664
Soon, you'll find out
why I can't be your legal representative.

420
00:28:28,289 --> 00:28:31,042
I hope you can find another lawyer soon.

421
00:28:31,584 --> 00:28:32,460
Goodbye.

422
00:28:33,503 --> 00:28:35,713
-Look, you will...
-Please get out!

423
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:50,937
As soon as I deal
with the pressing matters,

424
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:53,898
I'll find corresponding sections
in the Civil Act and sue you.

425
00:28:54,149 --> 00:28:56,985
This is a clear case of defamation.
Do you know that?

426
00:29:02,615 --> 00:29:05,368
Gosh. That guy has problems.

427
00:29:05,452 --> 00:29:08,747
He's a total nutjob.
What is wrong with him?

428
00:29:09,164 --> 00:29:10,415
What does that jerk want from me?

429
00:29:10,957 --> 00:29:12,167
Why did he come here?

430
00:29:12,667 --> 00:29:13,835
I don't get it.

431
00:29:14,335 --> 00:29:15,712
What is his problem?

432
00:29:15,795 --> 00:29:17,338
Gosh, nothing is going my way.

433
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:19,924
I've never seen such a nutjob before.
That little...

434
00:29:21,676 --> 00:29:24,429
I can buy this whole place if I want to.

435
00:29:28,808 --> 00:29:32,437
The sales have increased immensely
and the shareholders

436
00:29:32,562 --> 00:29:35,398
deeply respect and trust Ms. Park.

437
00:29:39,027 --> 00:29:40,028
Mr. Chairman.

438
00:29:48,745 --> 00:29:49,871
You're here.

439
00:29:57,837 --> 00:30:00,757
It's refreshing to see each other here,
don't you think?

440
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,842
You're the reason I live.

441
00:30:03,301 --> 00:30:05,929
You've also completely
turned the company around.

442
00:30:07,096 --> 00:30:09,474
Getting my achievements recognized by you

443
00:30:10,558 --> 00:30:12,602
makes all the hard work worth it.

444
00:30:13,478 --> 00:30:14,687
But

445
00:30:15,355 --> 00:30:17,607
I do have the vice chairwoman title,
but in reality,

446
00:30:18,107 --> 00:30:19,943
I don't even have any shares.

447
00:30:20,485 --> 00:30:23,238
All the shareholders
treat me like a puppet.

448
00:30:23,321 --> 00:30:25,198
They don't even do anything.

449
00:30:25,698 --> 00:30:26,866
Don't be too upset.

450
00:30:27,116 --> 00:30:29,035
I've actually been thinking
about making some changes.

451
00:30:31,246 --> 00:30:32,330
Really?

452
00:30:33,748 --> 00:30:34,707
Bok-ja.

453
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:38,002
Yes, go ahead.

454
00:30:38,211 --> 00:30:41,214
I rarely see you these days
because you're so busy.

455
00:30:41,881 --> 00:30:43,967
My life is so boring and dull
without you around.

456
00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:46,803
Gosh, please don't be like this.

457
00:30:47,178 --> 00:30:50,014
Why do you think I'm working so hard?

458
00:30:50,306 --> 00:30:52,642
The company has to operate
like a well-oiled machine

459
00:30:52,725 --> 00:30:56,187
for you to feel at ease
and live a stress-free life.

460
00:30:56,563 --> 00:30:59,232
Then, you'll be able to regain
your health quickly as well.

461
00:30:59,899 --> 00:31:02,110
I have to make sure that happens
so that we can enjoy

462
00:31:02,235 --> 00:31:04,612
a long and fun life together.

463
00:31:05,029 --> 00:31:06,072
I know.

464
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:09,033
I know how much you care about me.

465
00:31:09,450 --> 00:31:11,661
So, please be patient
for just a little longer.

466
00:31:11,828 --> 00:31:13,705
As soon as things in the company
become stable...

467
00:31:15,331 --> 00:31:17,750
Right, it'll take some time
for that to happen

468
00:31:17,834 --> 00:31:19,878
because no one listens to me now.

469
00:31:20,670 --> 00:31:22,005
Okay, all right.

470
00:31:22,297 --> 00:31:24,340
I'll change some things around

471
00:31:24,507 --> 00:31:26,050
so that everyone will have
to listen to you.

472
00:31:30,388 --> 00:31:32,557
Since we haven't had
pork rinds in a while,

473
00:31:32,765 --> 00:31:36,102
I should ask Ms. Cheon
to prepare some for dinner tonight.

474
00:31:59,125 --> 00:32:01,753
It feels weird to meet up with you
at a place like this.

475
00:32:03,338 --> 00:32:04,547
Why did you want to meet here?

476
00:32:04,964 --> 00:32:05,798
The two of us...

477
00:32:08,301 --> 00:32:09,469
What are we?

478
00:32:10,428 --> 00:32:12,805
-What do you mean?
-Aren't we in a relationship?

479
00:32:13,431 --> 00:32:14,349
A relationship?

480
00:32:16,684 --> 00:32:19,562
Hyo-ju, why are you being like this?
Don't be such an amateur.

481
00:32:20,855 --> 00:32:22,982
Yes, I like you.

482
00:32:23,316 --> 00:32:25,610
I can't sleep with a woman
I don't even like,

483
00:32:26,361 --> 00:32:28,446
but you can't call that a relationship.

484
00:32:28,613 --> 00:32:29,489
So,

485
00:32:30,907 --> 00:32:34,744
are you saying that what we had
was more like a business transaction?

486
00:32:35,536 --> 00:32:38,081
Don't put it that way.
I'm not that kind of guy.

487
00:32:38,164 --> 00:32:39,499
That's basically what you're saying.

488
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:42,293
You said we can't call it a relationship.

489
00:32:43,586 --> 00:32:44,671
Hey, by any chance,

490
00:32:45,922 --> 00:32:48,466
do you really like me?

491
00:32:50,927 --> 00:32:54,138
Hyo-ju, why are you being like this?
I didn't think you'd be this uncool.

492
00:32:54,931 --> 00:32:55,932
Sorry.

493
00:32:56,099 --> 00:32:56,975
Hyo-ju.

494
00:32:57,517 --> 00:32:58,893
Let's be cool about it, okay?

495
00:32:59,602 --> 00:33:02,146
Wasn't our relationship about getting
what we need from each other?

496
00:33:02,438 --> 00:33:03,773
Do you want to control me now or what?

497
00:33:05,483 --> 00:33:06,359
You're right.

498
00:33:08,111 --> 00:33:09,654
I shouldn't try to control you.

499
00:33:09,779 --> 00:33:10,905
Where shall we meet next week?

500
00:33:11,864 --> 00:33:13,324
I'll call you. You should get going now.

501
00:33:15,910 --> 00:33:18,579
I have to go to my kid's school
to meet with his teacher.

502
00:33:19,163 --> 00:33:21,541
Right, you're a mom.

503
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:24,335
I forget about it from time to time.

504
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:26,879
Call me.

505
00:33:36,222 --> 00:33:37,515
You told me that the gallery

506
00:33:37,682 --> 00:33:39,726
will take care of the shipping cost
and publicity expenses

507
00:33:39,809 --> 00:33:42,645
and that I'll get 40 percent
of what my paintings were sold for.

508
00:33:42,895 --> 00:33:45,606
Of course. I even signed the contract.

509
00:33:45,982 --> 00:33:48,234
-Then, why...
-You should speak with A-jin.

510
00:33:48,317 --> 00:33:51,904
She told me that I have to discuss
with her first when it comes to anything

511
00:33:52,071 --> 00:33:53,614
related to your payouts.

512
00:33:54,407 --> 00:33:56,743
She said
that she's sort of like your agent.

513
00:33:56,826 --> 00:33:58,995
No. That's not true, Ms. Seo.
You have to speak with me.

514
00:33:59,078 --> 00:34:01,289
Just talk to A-jin
and get things cleared up.

515
00:34:02,373 --> 00:34:04,667
Who does she think she is?
I can't believe she's stealing my pay.

516
00:34:04,751 --> 00:34:08,004
Then, why did you steal her husband?

517
00:34:08,921 --> 00:34:09,797
Sorry?

518
00:34:12,884 --> 00:34:14,343
When you get a little older,

519
00:34:14,969 --> 00:34:18,097
you'll realize
that life is like a boomerang.

520
00:34:25,772 --> 00:34:28,399
I know that it's not my place
to say anything,

521
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:30,818
but as you know, the annex is empty now.

522
00:34:31,486 --> 00:34:34,822
How about you have your husband
stay there for the time being?

523
00:34:39,285 --> 00:34:40,578
I should go, ma'am.

524
00:34:41,162 --> 00:34:43,164
All right. Yes, you should go.

525
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:45,708
Thank you.

526
00:34:59,847 --> 00:35:00,973
Make sure Jae-gu moves out.

527
00:35:04,977 --> 00:35:07,105
I'll let Jae-gu stay at the annex.

528
00:35:07,355 --> 00:35:09,148
I think that will be better.

529
00:35:19,575 --> 00:35:21,828
What did you do with my paintings
in the room?

530
00:35:21,994 --> 00:35:22,995
I put them away.

531
00:35:23,955 --> 00:35:26,040
Give them back. Right now.

532
00:35:26,165 --> 00:35:28,960
I'll keep them until the situation here
gets sorted out.

533
00:35:29,043 --> 00:35:32,255
-Who says you can keep them?
-Well, I can obviously do whatever I want.

534
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:33,464
Give them back.

535
00:35:33,631 --> 00:35:36,551
Also, why did you steal
my payout from the gallery?

536
00:35:36,634 --> 00:35:38,427
Watch your mouth. I never stole anything.

537
00:35:38,511 --> 00:35:40,179
You know that you need
to settle up with me.

538
00:35:40,263 --> 00:35:42,682
I just put a hold on that payment.
I'm not like you.

539
00:35:43,474 --> 00:35:47,436
Ask your darling his opinion
on what you should do in this situation.

540
00:35:48,437 --> 00:35:50,523
Dear, my paintings...

541
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:52,483
I painted them, so they're mine, right?

542
00:35:52,567 --> 00:35:55,069
I'm keeping them
for letting you take my husband.

543
00:35:55,153 --> 00:35:56,779
My husband is such a wonderful man.

544
00:35:56,863 --> 00:35:59,448
You'll find no other man like him.

545
00:35:59,532 --> 00:36:01,242
Isn't that why you stole him?

546
00:36:01,325 --> 00:36:03,077
He's worth way more
than those stupid paintings.

547
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:05,621
Dear, say something.

548
00:36:05,746 --> 00:36:07,081
Tell her whose paintings are they.

549
00:36:10,209 --> 00:36:11,878
I'm not King Solomon,

550
00:36:12,044 --> 00:36:15,089
-but if you two split those paintings...
-What?

551
00:36:15,173 --> 00:36:17,258
What is wrong with you? Hey.

552
00:36:17,383 --> 00:36:19,760
-Those two are ridiculous.
-What? Split the paintings?

553
00:36:19,844 --> 00:36:22,638
-How can you talk such nonsense?
-You should have said,

554
00:36:22,722 --> 00:36:24,640
"No, you just keep those paintings."

555
00:36:24,724 --> 00:36:26,517
That's how King Solomon
found the real mother...

556
00:36:27,768 --> 00:36:31,814
Poor me. I pity my life. Gosh.

557
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:39,030
Jae-gu.

558
00:36:39,447 --> 00:36:40,698
I heard there are empty rooms here.

559
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:42,909
-Are you going to stay here?
-Yes.

560
00:37:05,056 --> 00:37:07,183
-Have you had dinner yet?
-What about you?

561
00:37:07,558 --> 00:37:11,020
I have if you've eaten,
but I haven't if that's not the case.

562
00:37:11,187 --> 00:37:12,521
Then, I guess you haven't eaten yet.

563
00:37:12,647 --> 00:37:14,023
Let's go. I'll treat you.

564
00:37:16,484 --> 00:37:18,069
-Excuse me.
-Yes.

565
00:37:23,574 --> 00:37:27,161
What do you think? I bet he's probably
drinking somewhere by himself.

566
00:37:27,787 --> 00:37:31,332
What can you do? It's not
like you can spank your grown-up son.

567
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:37,630
It doesn't really go well with wine,

568
00:37:37,922 --> 00:37:40,174
but you know we have fond memories of it.

569
00:37:40,967 --> 00:37:44,971
I heard that such shared memories
are what makes breakups so devastating.

570
00:37:45,304 --> 00:37:48,391
I wonder if Jae-seok
is heartbroken at all.

571
00:37:49,558 --> 00:37:50,851
That crazy punk.

572
00:37:51,477 --> 00:37:52,561
That crazy punk.

573
00:37:56,315 --> 00:37:58,901
You said that you'll kick him
out of the company.

574
00:37:59,527 --> 00:38:01,696
Will you actually do it?

575
00:38:01,779 --> 00:38:04,240
Of course, I have to. You're there now.

576
00:38:04,365 --> 00:38:06,492
You cleaned up the mess he made.

577
00:38:06,575 --> 00:38:08,703
I must make sure
he can never mess things up again.

578
00:38:10,663 --> 00:38:12,164
If that's the case,

579
00:38:13,249 --> 00:38:14,792
when will you do it?

580
00:38:15,668 --> 00:38:18,379
-What did you just say?
-I also couldn't believe my eyes

581
00:38:18,504 --> 00:38:19,839
when I read that petition.

582
00:38:20,256 --> 00:38:23,217
That is crazy.
There are so many lawyers in Seoul.

583
00:38:23,759 --> 00:38:25,636
Don't you think he came
to see me on purpose?

584
00:38:26,262 --> 00:38:28,973
-No way.
-He could've talked to the legal advisor.

585
00:38:29,432 --> 00:38:31,267
Why do you think he came to see me?

586
00:38:33,561 --> 00:38:36,814
I know that this is a terrible question,

587
00:38:37,648 --> 00:38:38,649
but I'll ask you anyway.

588
00:38:39,942 --> 00:38:42,778
What did you like about that man?

589
00:38:43,362 --> 00:38:44,697
I mean, you married him.

590
00:38:49,327 --> 00:38:50,536
The weight of marriage.

591
00:38:51,078 --> 00:38:52,621
You mentioned it the other day.

592
00:38:53,831 --> 00:38:57,418
You said that the weight
must be different for the two of us.

593
00:38:59,378 --> 00:39:01,088
But then, I started wondering

594
00:39:01,714 --> 00:39:04,967
if I really took marriage a lot
more seriously than he did.

595
00:39:06,761 --> 00:39:07,845
The answer is no.

596
00:39:09,221 --> 00:39:12,058
I'm also partially responsible
for all the choices that brought us

597
00:39:12,516 --> 00:39:13,684
to where we are now.

598
00:39:19,482 --> 00:39:20,316
Mr. Ahn.

599
00:39:20,816 --> 00:39:21,692
Mr. Ahn!

600
00:39:24,111 --> 00:39:26,947
Gosh, it looks like you drank a lot.
You should have called a chauffeur.

601
00:39:27,448 --> 00:39:28,991
Why did you call me?

602
00:39:30,284 --> 00:39:32,286
My dear Mr. Park is here.

603
00:39:33,788 --> 00:39:34,747
Mr. Park.

604
00:39:35,373 --> 00:39:36,457
I'm...

605
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:39,668
I'm so lonely.

606
00:39:41,253 --> 00:39:45,216
I feel as if my heart
has been shot by a bullet.

607
00:39:48,886 --> 00:39:49,804
You see.

608
00:39:51,472 --> 00:39:54,725
I went to a lawyer's office
earlier today to hire him,

609
00:39:55,101 --> 00:39:57,728
but something very surprising
happened there.

610
00:39:58,687 --> 00:40:03,025
Do you know what he said?
He refused to represent me.

611
00:40:03,150 --> 00:40:04,026
Pardon?

612
00:40:05,528 --> 00:40:08,531
The world is just so cruel
to me right now.

613
00:40:08,614 --> 00:40:10,533
Why did he refuse to represent you?

614
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:13,994
Could it have been because
there's a slim chance that you'll win?

615
00:40:14,078 --> 00:40:17,373
No, it's not that.
He didn't even hear my story.

616
00:40:18,290 --> 00:40:20,459
He started verbally bashing me
as soon as he saw my face

617
00:40:20,626 --> 00:40:22,795
and my name on the petition.

618
00:40:23,129 --> 00:40:26,257
Even a lawyer lashed out at me.

619
00:40:27,716 --> 00:40:29,468
My dad lashed out at me too.

620
00:40:30,219 --> 00:40:31,804
And my daughter
is completely ignoring me now.

621
00:40:32,721 --> 00:40:35,266
My wife is also...

622
00:40:38,269 --> 00:40:39,186
Mr. Ahn.

623
00:40:39,937 --> 00:40:43,482
Mr. Ahn, I'll drive you home. Okay?

624
00:40:45,734 --> 00:40:47,903
When did things start to go wrong?

625
00:40:48,070 --> 00:40:51,282
What do you think?
The day when you kissed that artist.

626
00:40:51,532 --> 00:40:53,242
I think that's when things
started to go haywire.

627
00:40:53,325 --> 00:40:54,869
That wasn't our first kiss.

628
00:40:55,202 --> 00:40:57,329
-Sorry?
-We actually...

629
00:40:59,206 --> 00:41:01,417
Our first kiss was way before that.

630
00:41:01,834 --> 00:41:04,587
You caught us kissing
a while after the first one.

631
00:41:06,714 --> 00:41:09,884
I'll give you a ride if you'll leave now,
but I have to get going otherwise.

632
00:41:09,967 --> 00:41:11,927
I have to go home and bathe my baby.

633
00:41:12,011 --> 00:41:13,971
Don't do this to me. Don't leave me.

634
00:41:14,054 --> 00:41:16,140
-Goodness gracious.
-Please...

635
00:41:45,836 --> 00:41:48,047
-Did Jae-gu move into that house?
-Yes.

636
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:51,926
I left a blanket and pillow there for him
as you asked.

637
00:41:52,051 --> 00:41:54,553
Great. Thank you.

638
00:41:54,762 --> 00:41:55,971
Also, thanks for calling me.

639
00:41:56,055 --> 00:41:57,681
No problem at all, ma'am.

640
00:41:58,766 --> 00:42:00,100
You don't even need to thank me.

641
00:42:00,309 --> 00:42:03,145
You've been talking to A-jin's housekeeper
often on the phone, right?

642
00:42:03,229 --> 00:42:04,313
Yes, ma'am.

643
00:42:04,563 --> 00:42:07,066
All of them will be gathered
at that house very soon.

644
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:10,528
-Pardon me?
-The three little pigs.

645
00:42:27,419 --> 00:42:30,881
Sir, it'll be great
if you can drive a bit slowly.

646
00:42:33,342 --> 00:42:34,176
Mr. Ahn.

647
00:42:35,094 --> 00:42:36,387
Where should I drop you off?

648
00:42:36,470 --> 00:42:38,806
-Drop me off at my place.
-Which one?

649
00:42:38,973 --> 00:42:40,808
What do you mean? Take me home!

650
00:42:40,933 --> 00:42:44,019
Right, but you have many homes.

651
00:42:44,270 --> 00:42:45,938
Where should I take you?

652
00:42:46,063 --> 00:42:49,024
You're right. I have many homes.

653
00:42:52,236 --> 00:42:54,363
I do have many homes.

654
00:43:17,928 --> 00:43:19,805
You know that the litigation
has begun, right?

655
00:43:20,222 --> 00:43:21,223
Please play it fair.

656
00:43:21,307 --> 00:43:22,182
What do you mean?

657
00:43:23,058 --> 00:43:24,852
Too bad if you didn't understand
what I meant.

658
00:43:25,185 --> 00:43:27,980
By the way, is Mr. Ahn not home yet?

659
00:43:28,105 --> 00:43:28,939
No.

660
00:43:29,398 --> 00:43:31,025
I was going to say hello if he was home.

661
00:43:31,692 --> 00:43:32,693
I'll get going then.

662
00:43:38,657 --> 00:43:41,577
Where is this man? Why isn't he home yet?

663
00:43:55,924 --> 00:43:57,760
Ms. Woo, come have some food.

664
00:43:57,885 --> 00:43:59,178
I'll wash up first.

665
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:03,307
It doesn't look like
he came home last night.

666
00:44:03,557 --> 00:44:06,143
His cycling clothes are still hung
on the drying rack too.

667
00:44:20,407 --> 00:44:21,492
Where is Ms. Jo?

668
00:44:21,909 --> 00:44:23,410
I told her to go over to the annex.

669
00:44:23,702 --> 00:44:27,748
All three of your children
are there right now.

670
00:44:28,707 --> 00:44:30,751
They can't even look after themselves.

671
00:44:30,959 --> 00:44:33,587
Who is going to cook and do laundry?

672
00:44:36,423 --> 00:44:39,259
You're doing that again.
I told you not to get upset like this.

673
00:44:39,718 --> 00:44:42,554
You said you'd just think
that you have no children.

674
00:44:42,638 --> 00:44:44,348
They are the bane of my existence.

675
00:44:45,391 --> 00:44:49,019
I know that they're my children,
but none of them is decent.

676
00:44:49,353 --> 00:44:51,980
I trusted A-jin,

677
00:44:52,106 --> 00:44:53,649
but even she wants a divorce.

678
00:44:55,609 --> 00:44:56,777
What will happen after I die?

679
00:44:57,569 --> 00:44:59,905
They obviously won't be able
to run the company properly.

680
00:45:00,114 --> 00:45:03,534
The company will fall apart
and become worthless.

681
00:45:06,620 --> 00:45:08,580
That being said...

682
00:45:10,249 --> 00:45:11,083
Honey.

683
00:45:11,917 --> 00:45:14,795
Shall we just let it all go

684
00:45:15,254 --> 00:45:17,548
and go on a cruise?

685
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:20,300
-A cruise?
-Why should we even grow the business?

686
00:45:20,384 --> 00:45:22,803
None of your children
is competent enough to inherit it.

687
00:45:23,137 --> 00:45:27,015
Since the company is doing so well now,
you should sell it

688
00:45:27,099 --> 00:45:29,184
and keep the cash.

689
00:45:29,810 --> 00:45:31,520
Do you think I should sell the company?

690
00:45:31,979 --> 00:45:36,275
I've been meeting a lot of businessmen
through my MBA program.

691
00:45:36,775 --> 00:45:39,570
Acquisitions, mergers,
and selling companies.

692
00:45:39,736 --> 00:45:43,824
The wisest strategy is to find
the right times to do those things.

693
00:45:43,949 --> 00:45:46,243
They say you should make hay
while the sun shines.

694
00:45:46,493 --> 00:45:50,539
Now is the perfect time to seek
such opportunities for our company.

695
00:45:57,713 --> 00:45:59,756
Gosh, never mind. Forget what I just said.

696
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:02,509
Sorry, I shouldn't have said any of it.

697
00:46:03,427 --> 00:46:05,846
Please don't let it bother you.

698
00:46:06,305 --> 00:46:07,973
What is life all about anyway?

699
00:46:08,182 --> 00:46:11,768
We should just enjoy good food like this

700
00:46:11,852 --> 00:46:14,396
and try to have fun.

701
00:46:15,606 --> 00:46:17,357
Try this. It's braised beef brisket.

702
00:46:28,911 --> 00:46:29,912
Dear.

703
00:46:31,538 --> 00:46:33,207
You see, if...

704
00:46:33,790 --> 00:46:35,042
If what?

705
00:46:35,334 --> 00:46:36,418
If...

706
00:46:37,753 --> 00:46:39,338
If I sell the company

707
00:46:40,172 --> 00:46:42,591
like you said,

708
00:46:43,926 --> 00:46:46,220
I'll be harshly criticized for it
for the rest of my life.

709
00:46:46,929 --> 00:46:49,681
I'm also worried
what my employees will think of me.

710
00:46:50,432 --> 00:46:53,435
Why are you worried? You have me.

711
00:46:55,479 --> 00:46:56,438
You?

712
00:46:57,231 --> 00:46:59,358
Just use me.

713
00:46:59,983 --> 00:47:02,611
You can hide behind me.

714
00:47:03,111 --> 00:47:05,030
I'll take all the blame.

715
00:47:06,615 --> 00:47:10,160
I'll be your shield.
It's the least I can do for you.

716
00:47:17,751 --> 00:47:19,795
So? Have you found out anything?

717
00:47:20,045 --> 00:47:23,298
Yes, sir. I tailed her for 12 hours
and gathered intel

718
00:47:23,715 --> 00:47:24,967
on the guy she's seeing.

719
00:47:25,425 --> 00:47:26,260
Really?

720
00:47:26,969 --> 00:47:28,136
What does he do for a living?

721
00:47:34,601 --> 00:47:36,478
-I miss you.
-Let go of me.

722
00:47:37,312 --> 00:47:38,981
Can't we keep seeing each other?

723
00:47:41,275 --> 00:47:43,151
You don't love me.

724
00:47:43,527 --> 00:47:44,695
You just want to hold me.

725
00:47:44,820 --> 00:47:46,572
It's the same thing.
What's the difference?

726
00:47:47,447 --> 00:47:50,242
I met up with your wife.
I won't see you anymore.

727
00:47:50,367 --> 00:47:52,160
No, I can't.

728
00:47:52,703 --> 00:47:56,206
I'll take responsibility for the baby
if you want me to. If it's mine, that is.

729
00:47:56,290 --> 00:47:57,207
Forget it.

730
00:47:58,166 --> 00:48:01,086
Just be good to your wife from now on.

731
00:48:01,169 --> 00:48:03,130
-Gyeong-hui.
-Your wife

732
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:05,132
loves you.

733
00:48:07,509 --> 00:48:10,929
I don't want to be a bitch anymore.

734
00:48:12,598 --> 00:48:14,725
I'll change your name from Seong-ju

735
00:48:15,892 --> 00:48:17,644
to Dr. Jang on my phone.

736
00:48:17,853 --> 00:48:20,188
You should just delete my number.

737
00:48:21,356 --> 00:48:22,232
Hey.

738
00:48:23,066 --> 00:48:24,484
Do you have another man?

739
00:48:26,361 --> 00:48:27,613
Why do you think so?

740
00:48:27,988 --> 00:48:30,365
The guy who beat up your husband
to a pulp at the parking lot.

741
00:48:31,366 --> 00:48:32,284
Who is he?

742
00:48:33,910 --> 00:48:36,663
Everyone thinks that it was your doing.

743
00:48:37,873 --> 00:48:40,000
Why are you asking me?

744
00:48:42,377 --> 00:48:45,213
I'll visit your clinic
if I ever need Botox injections.

745
00:48:46,006 --> 00:48:48,717
That will probably the only time
you'll ever see me.

746
00:48:51,803 --> 00:48:54,556
We're already here.
Are you really going to leave like this?

747
00:48:55,974 --> 00:48:57,893
I'm not an animal like you, okay?

748
00:49:22,167 --> 00:49:24,044
So, I kept tailing that guy.

749
00:49:24,169 --> 00:49:27,089
-And?
-He went to a plastic surgery clinic.

750
00:49:27,339 --> 00:49:28,173
What?

751
00:49:30,467 --> 00:49:33,136
By any chance,
was it J Top Plastic Surgery?

752
00:49:34,971 --> 00:49:35,847
Yes.

753
00:49:44,147 --> 00:49:45,482
What a prick.

754
00:49:46,316 --> 00:49:47,693
There's a thing called morals.

755
00:49:48,068 --> 00:49:49,736
He can't do that.

756
00:49:53,532 --> 00:49:56,284
-Ms. Woo, do you have to get divorced?
-Yes.

757
00:49:56,451 --> 00:49:59,121
Your husband really wants
the family to stay together.

758
00:49:59,204 --> 00:50:00,539
He does.

759
00:50:00,706 --> 00:50:03,166
The problem is that he also wants
to stay with that woman.

760
00:50:06,128 --> 00:50:07,629
Here's what I think.

761
00:50:07,963 --> 00:50:09,464
Marriage is a lot like running a marathon.

762
00:50:09,965 --> 00:50:12,676
I became thirsty
after running for about ten years.

763
00:50:12,926 --> 00:50:14,177
Hence, I drank some water.

764
00:50:14,553 --> 00:50:17,889
I got full of the water,
so I sat down and took a little break.

765
00:50:18,014 --> 00:50:20,350
That doesn't mean
I'll give up the marathon.

766
00:50:21,143 --> 00:50:23,353
What does getting divorced have to do
with running a marathon?

767
00:50:23,437 --> 00:50:26,148
Gosh, you and I are just
not communicating here.

768
00:50:26,648 --> 00:50:30,485
This is exactly why I'm looking
for a lawyer who can empathize with me.

769
00:50:32,070 --> 00:50:34,072
Did he have an affair?

770
00:50:34,197 --> 00:50:36,283
Yes, it's still ongoing.

771
00:50:36,366 --> 00:50:38,785
Mr. Ahn, are you still cheating
on your wife?

772
00:50:38,994 --> 00:50:42,456
Of course. I'm a very responsible person.

773
00:50:42,873 --> 00:50:43,874
I can't leave that woman.

774
00:50:43,999 --> 00:50:46,001
Then, just agree to the divorce.

775
00:50:46,376 --> 00:50:47,711
Divorce? No.

776
00:50:48,128 --> 00:50:50,422
My wife and my daughter
matter the most to me.

777
00:50:50,505 --> 00:50:51,548
I can't agree to the divorce.

778
00:50:51,631 --> 00:50:53,884
You can't agree to the divorce,
but you'll keep having an affair.

779
00:50:53,967 --> 00:50:55,135
Is that what you're saying?

780
00:50:55,343 --> 00:50:57,763
Yes, I guess that's the gist
of what I'm trying to say.

781
00:50:58,138 --> 00:51:00,098
It's impossible to mediate this dispute.

782
00:51:01,683 --> 00:51:03,310
If that's the case, just go to trial.

783
00:51:03,435 --> 00:51:05,145
Please help us find a solution.

784
00:51:05,228 --> 00:51:07,647
Solution, my foot.
You keep talking complete nonsense.

785
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:11,193
We should find another mediator.

786
00:51:25,207 --> 00:51:27,125
Tell Lawyer Kim
to come meet me here today.

787
00:51:27,209 --> 00:51:28,084
Yes, sir.

788
00:51:29,211 --> 00:51:31,963
The company's legal advisor
is coming to meet with Mr. Chairman.

789
00:51:32,047 --> 00:51:34,174
I want to know
if Mr. Ahn is in his office now.

790
00:51:34,257 --> 00:51:36,510
Please ask Mr. Park.

791
00:51:36,635 --> 00:51:39,888
I already asked. He's not here today
because of his divorce mediation.

792
00:51:42,057 --> 00:51:43,767
The universe is helping me.

793
00:51:46,853 --> 00:51:49,397
Mr. Chairman should know about it too.
Please go tell him now.

794
00:51:49,606 --> 00:51:52,234
Yes, ma'am. I mean, Ms. Vice Chairwoman.

795
00:52:01,284 --> 00:52:02,869
-You're...
-What did I tell you?

796
00:52:03,245 --> 00:52:06,623
I said that you'll soon find out
why I can't be your legal representative.

797
00:52:07,082 --> 00:52:08,875
See you later. Let's go.

798
00:52:09,417 --> 00:52:11,670
What the hell is going on now? Hey.

799
00:52:12,003 --> 00:52:13,004
You better stop right there.

800
00:52:19,052 --> 00:52:20,554
The floor is so slippery.

801
00:52:24,432 --> 00:52:27,227
I've been wondering
whether I should tell you this.

802
00:52:28,937 --> 00:52:31,356
Dr. Jang is the man
your wife has been seeing.

803
00:52:33,191 --> 00:52:34,568
Remember the group our wives made?

804
00:52:35,193 --> 00:52:37,863
The director
of the plastic surgery clinic. It's him.

805
00:52:39,573 --> 00:52:40,448
Sorry?

806
00:52:41,283 --> 00:52:43,702
It sure is easy to miss what's
in front of you. Isn't it crazy?

807
00:52:44,035 --> 00:52:45,787
That must have been
why she met with his wife...

808
00:52:45,871 --> 00:52:46,997
Gosh.

809
00:52:48,707 --> 00:52:52,627
Does that mean he hired someone
to beat me up like that?

810
00:52:53,378 --> 00:52:54,963
Well, I guess so.

811
00:52:56,965 --> 00:52:59,718
I didn't think he could do such a thing,
but he's not a good guy.

812
00:52:59,801 --> 00:53:01,344
I mean, there are so many women.

813
00:53:01,678 --> 00:53:04,556
Why did it have to be the mother
of his son's friend?

814
00:53:24,534 --> 00:53:26,202
Sir, I heard that you wanted to see me.

815
00:53:26,661 --> 00:53:28,163
Prepare an assignment agreement.

816
00:53:28,413 --> 00:53:31,458
I'd like to transfer all the shares I own
to Vice Chairwoman Bok-ja Park...

817
00:53:32,083 --> 00:53:35,211
I mean, Ji-yeong Park.
I'd like to give them to her.

818
00:53:35,921 --> 00:53:37,964
-Sir.
-And notify the company too.

819
00:53:38,048 --> 00:53:41,051
They'll have a new major shareholder
as soon as the transfer is completed.

820
00:53:41,301 --> 00:53:43,261
We'll try to sell the company
right after that.

821
00:53:43,762 --> 00:53:45,847
It's confidential for now,
so keep it to yourself.

822
00:53:45,931 --> 00:53:49,142
I think Mr. Chairman told him
to prepare an assignment agreement.

823
00:53:49,351 --> 00:53:52,145
He said he'd like to transfer
all of his shares to you.

824
00:54:01,196 --> 00:54:02,280
This is so good.

825
00:54:03,615 --> 00:54:06,701
Jae-gu, how much do you want?

826
00:54:08,203 --> 00:54:09,663
Half.

827
00:54:10,205 --> 00:54:11,206
Are you crazy?

828
00:54:11,748 --> 00:54:13,792
What will I get if Dad gives you half?

829
00:54:14,334 --> 00:54:15,752
Dad lost so much money because of you.

830
00:54:15,835 --> 00:54:18,880
By the way, why on earth
is Jae-seok staying here?

831
00:54:18,964 --> 00:54:20,090
He has his place.

832
00:54:20,173 --> 00:54:22,968
I know, right? Isn't he so pathetic?

833
00:54:23,051 --> 00:54:24,761
Don't even get me started.

834
00:54:28,348 --> 00:54:30,350
Hey. Jae-hui!

835
00:54:39,776 --> 00:54:40,652
Hello.

836
00:54:41,236 --> 00:54:43,989
The non bis in idem principle.
Have you heard of it?

837
00:54:44,698 --> 00:54:47,200
-Pardon me?
-The police already think

838
00:54:47,492 --> 00:54:49,536
that you tried to hurt that woman
as per my order.

839
00:54:50,912 --> 00:54:52,247
Let it be the case.

840
00:54:52,872 --> 00:54:54,207
Let's actually do it.

841
00:54:55,458 --> 00:54:58,044
-Ma'am.
-Go break her.

842
00:54:58,962 --> 00:55:01,423
I must teach that woman a lesson.

843
00:55:01,881 --> 00:55:02,966
Will you be able to do it?

844
00:55:03,508 --> 00:55:04,384
No.

845
00:55:05,218 --> 00:55:06,469
You have to do it.

846
00:55:08,888 --> 00:55:10,724
We must not let her go any further

847
00:55:11,391 --> 00:55:13,184
or have her way.

848
00:55:14,269 --> 00:55:15,603
Cripple her.

849
00:55:23,486 --> 00:55:24,362
Hey.

850
00:55:24,946 --> 00:55:26,823
What time did you say
Ms. Morinake will be here?

851
00:55:28,116 --> 00:55:29,451
She should be arriving any minute now.

852
00:55:33,788 --> 00:55:34,706
This is

853
00:55:34,789 --> 00:55:37,709
the art consultant
who introduced the painting, War II,

854
00:55:37,792 --> 00:55:39,711
to our gallery.

855
00:55:39,919 --> 00:55:42,088
Hello, I'm A-jin Woo.

856
00:55:43,131 --> 00:55:46,384
You have a good eye
and you're strikingly beautiful too.

857
00:55:46,468 --> 00:55:49,637
Not at all. Thank you for your kind words.

858
00:55:50,430 --> 00:55:53,391
She would like to take a look
at a few more paintings.

859
00:55:53,558 --> 00:55:55,685
-Help her select the best ones.
-Shall I?

860
00:55:56,603 --> 00:55:57,896
Please give me a moment.

861
00:55:58,021 --> 00:56:00,940
I'll go prepare a few samples
that you may find helpful.

862
00:56:01,149 --> 00:56:04,402
I'll trust your keen eye for art
once again.

863
00:56:20,376 --> 00:56:22,712
Well, I hope this is not
a discourteous thing to ask.

864
00:56:23,338 --> 00:56:26,758
Would you allow me to embellish your shoes
if you trust my taste?

865
00:56:33,056 --> 00:56:35,225
Everything is in your hands now.

866
00:56:35,391 --> 00:56:36,810
Please don't worry.

867
00:56:37,102 --> 00:56:38,561
Just trust me.

868
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:41,523
Let's get it done.

869
00:56:46,111 --> 00:56:49,072
Please sign here
as well as on the last page.

870
00:57:11,344 --> 00:57:13,138
STOCK TRANSFER (ASSIGNMENT) AGREEMENT

871
00:57:13,221 --> 00:57:15,974
ASSIGNEE BOK-JA PARK

872
00:57:20,103 --> 00:57:23,857
ASSIGNEE BOK-JA PARK

873
00:58:06,733 --> 00:58:08,610
I think you've been kicked out.

874
00:58:08,693 --> 00:58:10,528
Why didn't anyone tell me about that?

875
00:58:10,612 --> 00:58:12,947
I told you. Ms. Park told me
to inform you about it.

876
00:58:13,114 --> 00:58:15,074
Don't trust Bok-ja Park too much.

877
00:58:15,158 --> 00:58:18,369
Is it true she had a daughter
with leukemia?

878
00:58:18,453 --> 00:58:21,289
Everything she told you is a lie.
Please be careful with her.

879
00:58:21,372 --> 00:58:24,167
I'll give you appropriate compensation
for this house, so get out.

880
00:58:24,250 --> 00:58:25,585
Hey, mistress.

881
00:58:25,793 --> 00:58:28,588
I was going to wrap things up
and leave quietly,

882
00:58:28,671 --> 00:58:30,507
but you picked a fight with me first.

883
00:58:30,590 --> 00:58:32,425
I won't let anyone take you from me.

884
00:58:32,717 --> 00:58:33,927
Is it me or that woman?

885
00:58:34,010 --> 00:58:36,513
I'm abandoning you now.

886
00:58:36,721 --> 00:58:39,474
Get out of this house
first thing in the morning.

887
00:58:40,058 --> 00:58:42,227
Bong-sik won't let Dr. Jang
get away with this.

888
00:58:42,310 --> 00:58:43,561
He even got her pregnant.

889
00:58:43,686 --> 00:58:45,313
This is no ordinary matter.

890
00:58:45,438 --> 00:58:48,358
I'll make my next move
as quietly as possible.

891
00:58:48,650 --> 00:58:51,819
Then, I'll get things ready
for the next step as quietly as possible.

892
00:58:52,028 --> 00:58:55,156
I love my wife.
And I don't want this divorce.

893
00:58:55,240 --> 00:58:57,408
A-jin, I love you.

894
00:58:57,951 --> 00:59:01,496
But you know what?
I've lived long enough to know

895
00:59:01,663 --> 00:59:03,748
that not everything goes my way.

896
00:59:04,624 --> 00:59:05,750
Thank you.

897
00:59:08,419 --> 00:59:10,421
