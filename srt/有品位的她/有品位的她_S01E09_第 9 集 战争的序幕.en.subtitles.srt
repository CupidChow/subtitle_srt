1
00:00:40,665 --> 00:00:41,791
Get rid of them one by one.

2
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:45,754
You can start with that childish wench
over there.

3
00:00:45,837 --> 00:00:46,755
Get out!

4
00:00:46,838 --> 00:00:49,340
Your son can't eat at the table
and your daughter is getting kicked out!

5
00:00:49,424 --> 00:00:50,925
Let him come back home for the time being.

6
00:00:51,009 --> 00:00:52,886
He's the one who put me in this misery.

7
00:00:52,969 --> 00:00:56,890
So, you're saying Ms. Park
and Mr. Ahn aren't on good terms?

8
00:00:56,973 --> 00:00:58,433
They treat each other like strangers.

9
00:00:58,516 --> 00:01:01,227
You treat me like an insect!

10
00:01:01,311 --> 00:01:02,479
You son of a bitch!

11
00:01:02,562 --> 00:01:04,773
If you spew that kind of bullshit
once more,

12
00:01:05,273 --> 00:01:08,401
your wife and son will get kicked out too.

13
00:01:08,485 --> 00:01:09,903
He's not my child, but my enemy.

14
00:01:09,986 --> 00:01:14,157
That's why we should give birth
to a good kid who won't be our enemy.

15
00:01:14,783 --> 00:01:17,410
I'm going to have a child.

16
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:19,621
If you see my husband once again,

17
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:22,207
you'll get a lot more
than just harsh words.

18
00:01:22,415 --> 00:01:24,459
I'll make sure
that you won't even able to say

19
00:01:24,834 --> 00:01:27,712
that I'm out of line. Do you get that?

20
00:01:28,213 --> 00:01:30,799
I always do what I say I'll do.

21
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:33,092
Don't we love each other?

22
00:01:33,176 --> 00:01:35,804
Our love hasn't ended yet.

23
00:01:35,887 --> 00:01:38,515
CAREGIVER

24
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:42,769
-Hello?
-A-jin?

25
00:01:43,269 --> 00:01:44,938
I'm sorry for calling you so early.

26
00:01:45,605 --> 00:01:48,942
Can you come by with Jae-seok
before he goes to work?

27
00:01:49,734 --> 00:01:50,819
Okay, I will.

28
00:02:34,529 --> 00:02:35,530
Jae-seok Ahn!

29
00:02:36,614 --> 00:02:37,740
Stop right there!

30
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:46,916
I told you to stop! Stop!

31
00:03:07,562 --> 00:03:08,688
Did you sleep well?

32
00:03:10,773 --> 00:03:12,650
What's wrong?

33
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:15,028
What do you mean?

34
00:03:15,612 --> 00:03:16,988
You look sad.

35
00:03:17,655 --> 00:03:18,656
It's nothing.

36
00:03:18,781 --> 00:03:20,909
You should eat breakfast
and go to school, my princess.

37
00:03:20,992 --> 00:03:22,243
Go and wash your face.

38
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:23,328
What about Dad?

39
00:03:23,411 --> 00:03:24,913
Did he go for a morning exercise?

40
00:03:26,497 --> 00:03:27,373
Yes.

41
00:03:27,832 --> 00:03:31,502
You know that Dad always does his best.

42
00:03:32,211 --> 00:03:34,005
Mom, I'd like some toast for breakfast.

43
00:03:34,255 --> 00:03:35,131
Sure!

44
00:03:42,138 --> 00:03:43,348
I'm here.

45
00:03:44,974 --> 00:03:45,892
A-jin?

46
00:03:47,977 --> 00:03:50,104
-You're here.
-What's wrong?

47
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:57,111
Is your husband out cycling again?

48
00:04:08,414 --> 00:04:10,625
Ms. Ji-yeong Park wants you
to come downstairs.

49
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:13,211
-Go away.
-You should go.

50
00:04:13,586 --> 00:04:15,546
-Why don't you piss off?
-She called...

51
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:18,091
Who are you taking orders from?

52
00:04:18,299 --> 00:04:20,218
I did my part.

53
00:04:28,476 --> 00:04:32,021
Mr. Oh, please take care of Mr. Chairman.

54
00:04:32,313 --> 00:04:33,982
You know that he has
a doctor's appointment

55
00:04:34,065 --> 00:04:35,441
after physical therapy, right?

56
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:37,402
I'm not a child, you know.

57
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:41,239
-See you.
-Goodbye.

58
00:04:46,869 --> 00:04:48,830
Let's go somewhere this afternoon.

59
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:51,624
-Where?
-You'll see.

60
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:53,042
Okay.

61
00:04:53,918 --> 00:04:56,129
You should let your kids say goodbye.

62
00:05:16,065 --> 00:05:17,525
-You're here.
-Good morning.

63
00:05:21,654 --> 00:05:23,281
Mr. Chairman is going out.

64
00:05:24,407 --> 00:05:25,950
Let's talk after we say goodbye.

65
00:05:38,379 --> 00:05:39,839
-Have a good trip, Father.
-Bye, Father.

66
00:05:40,548 --> 00:05:42,633
I already called Dr. Choi,

67
00:05:42,717 --> 00:05:44,552
but since Mr. Chairman's
blood sugar levels are low,

68
00:05:44,635 --> 00:05:47,513
ask Dr. Choi whether he should
continue taking his medicine.

69
00:05:47,597 --> 00:05:48,473
Okay, ma'am.

70
00:05:49,307 --> 00:05:50,183
Honey.

71
00:05:51,309 --> 00:05:53,144
Have a safe trip.

72
00:05:53,269 --> 00:05:54,729
Okay. Go on.

73
00:05:55,897 --> 00:05:57,440
You all didn't need to come
and see me off.

74
00:05:57,899 --> 00:05:59,609
Well, they should from now on.

75
00:06:00,234 --> 00:06:02,445
Although, I can't tell
if they knew all along

76
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:05,323
but decided not to pay you the respect.

77
00:06:31,599 --> 00:06:32,433
Have a drink.

78
00:06:34,018 --> 00:06:35,686
You speak a dialect

79
00:06:36,145 --> 00:06:38,272
in front of my father,

80
00:06:38,523 --> 00:06:40,191
but you speak standard language
in front of us.

81
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:41,776
Are you bipolar?

82
00:06:42,276 --> 00:06:43,236
How is that possible?

83
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:46,864
Have this small snack before breakfast.

84
00:06:47,198 --> 00:06:49,200
How are we supposed to eat this
oily stuff in the morning?

85
00:06:49,408 --> 00:06:51,327
Pork and potato pancakes.

86
00:06:51,494 --> 00:06:52,870
This is persimmon leaves tea.

87
00:06:53,538 --> 00:06:55,581
Both are for Mr. Chairman.

88
00:06:56,124 --> 00:06:57,875
They are good for diabetes.

89
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:02,630
Do you have any interest in
what Mr. Chairman eats

90
00:07:02,713 --> 00:07:05,091
and how well he is recovering?

91
00:07:09,345 --> 00:07:12,974
I don't care about anything

92
00:07:13,057 --> 00:07:14,892
except for Mr. Chairman's well-being.

93
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:21,649
I shouldn't be the only one who cares.

94
00:07:21,732 --> 00:07:24,402
Don't you all want Mr. Chairman
to become healthy?

95
00:07:24,485 --> 00:07:25,903
What's your point?

96
00:07:25,987 --> 00:07:28,614
Mr. Chairman owns this house

97
00:07:29,323 --> 00:07:32,702
and I am his rightful wife.

98
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:35,538
-You.
-Watch your language!

99
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:37,790
How dare you call me like that?

100
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:43,212
If you can't call me "Mother,"
don't even think about starting with me.

101
00:07:45,089 --> 00:07:46,090
Ms. Cheon?

102
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:47,633
Yes, ma'am.

103
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:51,095
Why isn't Jae-gu here?

104
00:07:51,262 --> 00:07:54,515
I told him but he told me to piss off.

105
00:07:55,099 --> 00:07:56,767
If he leaves the house, empty his room.

106
00:07:57,727 --> 00:07:59,270
We'll use his room as a guest room.

107
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:00,688
Okay.

108
00:08:01,898 --> 00:08:03,399
What does that mean?

109
00:08:03,941 --> 00:08:05,610
Are you going to kick out my brother?

110
00:08:05,693 --> 00:08:10,406
Anything that badly influences
the health of Mr. Chairman

111
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:12,408
will be nipped in the bud.

112
00:08:13,034 --> 00:08:15,912
I will be stricter with his children.

113
00:08:16,537 --> 00:08:17,538
Unbelievable.

114
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,707
Why are you doing this?

115
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:22,168
To protect Mr. Chairman.

116
00:08:22,376 --> 00:08:24,504
How touching.

117
00:08:24,587 --> 00:08:26,839
Did you discuss this with my father?

118
00:08:27,381 --> 00:08:28,674
Or is this entirely your decision?

119
00:08:30,218 --> 00:08:32,053
This is entirely my decision

120
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:34,764
and I plan to tell him this evening.

121
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:37,433
-Who are you to make such a decision?
-You, get out right now.

122
00:08:37,808 --> 00:08:41,854
This part was decided by your father.

123
00:08:42,146 --> 00:08:43,105
Go home!

124
00:08:43,397 --> 00:08:44,941
There's no space for you here.

125
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:48,152
Who are you to talk down to me?

126
00:08:48,236 --> 00:08:49,445
Jae-hui Ahn!

127
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:53,115
You have no respect,

128
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:56,035
no common sense and no manners.

129
00:08:56,118 --> 00:08:58,162
Who taught you to behave like that?

130
00:08:58,329 --> 00:09:00,122
I am lawfully your mother.

131
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:04,794
I don't want to call
such a stupid person like you my daughter.

132
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:07,838
I have been merciful,

133
00:09:07,922 --> 00:09:10,466
since you are the daughter
of Mr. Chairman.

134
00:09:11,133 --> 00:09:12,301
Leave, now.

135
00:09:12,677 --> 00:09:14,053
I will never leave this house!

136
00:09:14,136 --> 00:09:15,471
Leave!

137
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:18,015
I won't!

138
00:09:18,266 --> 00:09:19,809
This is my house. Why do I need to leave?

139
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:21,060
I will never leave!

140
00:09:21,143 --> 00:09:23,896
This is not your house!
This is your father's house!

141
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:28,150
If you don't want to be dragged out,
leave on your own.

142
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:29,277
I told you

143
00:09:30,611 --> 00:09:31,988
what I will do with the room.

144
00:09:34,031 --> 00:09:37,618
Where do you expect me to go?

145
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,830
Get a single room or a dormitory,

146
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:42,665
it's not my problem.

147
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:44,292
Wait.

148
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,836
I think I heard enough

149
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:49,130
to understand what you are trying to say.

150
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:52,049
I need to leave now,
but I want to continue this discussion.

151
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:53,426
Excuse me.

152
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:28,586
Do you need to go home?

153
00:10:32,006 --> 00:10:33,215
I will come every day from now on.

154
00:10:33,716 --> 00:10:36,594
Can't you just

155
00:10:37,094 --> 00:10:38,596
stay here with me?

156
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:40,931
Can't you?

157
00:10:42,266 --> 00:10:43,434
I can't yet.

158
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:47,480
I need more time.

159
00:10:48,522 --> 00:10:49,482
Do you

160
00:10:50,358 --> 00:10:51,400
love me?

161
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:56,238
Yes.

162
00:10:58,574 --> 00:10:59,742
I think so.

163
00:11:07,583 --> 00:11:10,044
Life is a collection of ironies.

164
00:11:15,549 --> 00:11:17,093
Open up your eyes.

165
00:11:17,385 --> 00:11:19,720
A woman who has a plastic surgeon
as her husband,

166
00:11:20,137 --> 00:11:24,100
secretly has plastic surgery

167
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:26,018
from another surgeon.

168
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:28,729
I will begin the anesthesia.

169
00:11:31,232 --> 00:11:35,111
One who uses physical force
to get what he wants,

170
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:37,321
loses it by physical force.

171
00:11:39,448 --> 00:11:42,118
A man who once made a woman angry
by his laziness,

172
00:11:43,786 --> 00:11:48,249
once again made her angry
by his overdue diligence.

173
00:11:53,295 --> 00:11:54,130
A-jin.

174
00:11:55,005 --> 00:11:55,881
I don't think

175
00:11:58,676 --> 00:12:00,052
I can break up with her.

176
00:12:02,805 --> 00:12:03,931
Sorry.

177
00:12:05,307 --> 00:12:07,601
That doesn't mean that I don't love you.

178
00:12:09,019 --> 00:12:11,814
What can I do to something
that has already happened?

179
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:16,694
Bastard!

180
00:12:17,486 --> 00:12:18,404
Until

181
00:12:19,822 --> 00:12:21,657
I have made a decision,

182
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:25,244
don't say a word.

183
00:12:32,751 --> 00:12:33,961
She is really angry.

184
00:12:36,005 --> 00:12:37,381
She hit me hard.

185
00:12:50,561 --> 00:12:52,855
It must weigh more than 200kg.

186
00:12:53,105 --> 00:12:56,108
You still have it in you.

187
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:57,985
I was lucky.

188
00:12:58,486 --> 00:13:01,655
We took care of this area today.
We should hunt the other side tomorrow.

189
00:13:01,739 --> 00:13:02,990
Okay.

190
00:13:03,365 --> 00:13:06,994
We should go back to town
and have soju with that.

191
00:13:07,161 --> 00:13:08,537
Good idea.

192
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:15,836
Ms. Cheon!

193
00:13:21,884 --> 00:13:22,801
Why?

194
00:13:29,725 --> 00:13:32,937
About A-jin...

195
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:33,896
Yes?

196
00:13:35,105 --> 00:13:36,941
I think she has a problem.

197
00:13:37,107 --> 00:13:38,692
Yes, she looked concerned.

198
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:40,569
Find out what it is.

199
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:42,029
I will after I finish this.

200
00:13:42,571 --> 00:13:43,864
I need to go somewhere,

201
00:13:43,948 --> 00:13:46,367
so clean up the room downstairs
when the workers arrive.

202
00:13:46,534 --> 00:13:48,869
Yes, ma'am. Have a good trip.

203
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:12,434
Thank you.

204
00:14:24,071 --> 00:14:25,197
Hey. Mister!

205
00:14:25,948 --> 00:14:27,783
Empty this room by 4:00 p.m.

206
00:14:28,075 --> 00:14:28,909
Thank you.

207
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:34,206
Do you want food?

208
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:36,834
I have nowhere else to go.

209
00:14:37,585 --> 00:14:40,629
I heard that there's an empty room
at Ms. Woo's home.

210
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:44,049
Do you want me to come with you?

211
00:14:44,466 --> 00:14:46,802
You might feel awkward to go alone.

212
00:14:47,219 --> 00:14:48,846
-Will you?
-I will.

213
00:14:48,929 --> 00:14:50,180
You should speak with more respect.

214
00:14:50,347 --> 00:14:52,850
Gosh. Such a thing is not important.

215
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:58,314
Why do I deserve this treatment?

216
00:14:58,397 --> 00:14:59,648
Why!

217
00:15:00,816 --> 00:15:02,318
A-jin!

218
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:09,658
What brings you here?

219
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:11,911
I need to stay here

220
00:15:12,494 --> 00:15:15,122
in the empty guest room.

221
00:15:15,372 --> 00:15:18,292
How can you come here
after leaving that house?

222
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:19,668
Where do I go then?

223
00:15:20,878 --> 00:15:22,171
Do whatever you please.

224
00:15:24,882 --> 00:15:27,468
Are you looking down on me, too?

225
00:15:28,093 --> 00:15:29,178
Really?

226
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:31,263
Why did you come here?

227
00:15:31,889 --> 00:15:34,934
Ms. Ahn felt awkward to come here alone,
so I came with her.

228
00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:36,894
Take her back to where she came from.

229
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:39,647
We already have a lot going on here.

230
00:15:39,813 --> 00:15:40,898
Why is that?

231
00:15:41,315 --> 00:15:42,733
Is there a problem?

232
00:15:42,816 --> 00:15:44,985
Ms. Woo seems concerned.

233
00:15:45,069 --> 00:15:46,403
Enough.

234
00:15:47,112 --> 00:15:50,282
You should not poke your nose
into other people's matters.

235
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:52,326
Is her husband cheating on her?

236
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:53,869
My gosh.

237
00:15:54,995 --> 00:15:56,538
Are Jae-seok and A-jin
using separate rooms?

238
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:16,183
Do you want tea?

239
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:19,937
I don't think we are
close enough for that.

240
00:16:20,437 --> 00:16:24,024
Do you want a glass of water
so you can throw it on my face?

241
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,030
I am an artist.

242
00:16:30,364 --> 00:16:32,866
I have an open mind

243
00:16:33,283 --> 00:16:35,202
that normal people like you
do not understand.

244
00:16:35,703 --> 00:16:39,498
I haven't felt so certain in my life.

245
00:16:40,624 --> 00:16:43,168
I love that man.

246
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:45,796
An open mind?

247
00:16:47,297 --> 00:16:48,716
Felt so certain, you say?

248
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:53,971
You must be joking.

249
00:16:56,265 --> 00:16:58,517
I really don't understand.

250
00:16:58,767 --> 00:17:00,185
What is your plan?

251
00:17:00,811 --> 00:17:02,354
I will follow his plans.

252
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:08,277
You must be out of your mind.

253
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:10,070
Yes, I am.

254
00:17:10,612 --> 00:17:13,615
How else could I be seeing
a married man with a child?

255
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:16,410
Do you want me to divorce him?

256
00:17:17,494 --> 00:17:18,620
To be honest,

257
00:17:19,288 --> 00:17:20,581
I do.

258
00:17:21,248 --> 00:17:23,959
I hate being so secretive

259
00:17:24,084 --> 00:17:25,210
in our relationship.

260
00:17:26,795 --> 00:17:29,798
But he doesn't want that.

261
00:17:30,966 --> 00:17:33,469
Then, what does he want?

262
00:17:33,594 --> 00:17:35,304
He is a responsible man.

263
00:17:36,138 --> 00:17:38,223
So, he is having a hard time.

264
00:17:39,516 --> 00:17:42,728
That's why I want a fair play, ma'am.

265
00:17:44,354 --> 00:17:46,732
We should wait until

266
00:17:47,274 --> 00:17:48,692
he makes a decision.

267
00:17:51,445 --> 00:17:52,529
Your wish

268
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:55,741
is to be his wife, is it?

269
00:17:56,408 --> 00:18:01,038
Who on earth taught you
that this is normal?

270
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:04,583
Is this how an artist thinks?

271
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:06,502
I will accept all criticisms.

272
00:18:07,711 --> 00:18:09,880
When I received your call,
I told myself to be prepared

273
00:18:11,381 --> 00:18:12,966
to accept any punishment,

274
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:14,301
even if it means getting hit

275
00:18:15,636 --> 00:18:16,929
or being splashed with water.

276
00:18:20,974 --> 00:18:23,477
Okay, then.

277
00:18:23,852 --> 00:18:25,521
You can have him.

278
00:18:26,063 --> 00:18:29,024
I don't like the idea of this
"fair play" bullshit.

279
00:18:29,149 --> 00:18:30,609
I will not do such a thing.

280
00:18:30,859 --> 00:18:32,152
But I have a problem.

281
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:35,364
He and I have a daughter.

282
00:18:35,823 --> 00:18:38,617
She's the reason that's keeping me

283
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:41,537
from destroying the both of you.

284
00:18:45,415 --> 00:18:48,252
I need to protect my daughter.

285
00:18:51,088 --> 00:18:52,381
I need to keep

286
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:54,842
her father safe.

287
00:18:57,886 --> 00:19:01,932
Don't you know how devastating it is
for a child to lose

288
00:19:03,058 --> 00:19:03,934
her own father?

289
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:14,361
Artist Seong-hui Yun!

290
00:19:17,239 --> 00:19:18,448
I beg you.

291
00:19:21,118 --> 00:19:22,578
Please don't take away her father

292
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:25,873
from Ji-hu.

293
00:19:26,206 --> 00:19:27,082
Please.

294
00:19:28,584 --> 00:19:29,543
My husband.

295
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:32,379
Just secretly love him

296
00:19:33,088 --> 00:19:34,798
and let him go.

297
00:19:36,383 --> 00:19:38,218
Don't make him fall into this any deeper.

298
00:19:39,928 --> 00:19:41,430
I want it to go back to normal.

299
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:45,559
I will pretend

300
00:19:47,477 --> 00:19:49,313
that this never happened.

301
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:52,065
Please.

302
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:55,068
I beg you.

303
00:19:56,778 --> 00:19:59,907
I have nothing more to say. Sorry.

304
00:20:00,073 --> 00:20:01,158
Please leave.

305
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:16,548
Is this the shrine

306
00:20:16,632 --> 00:20:19,718
where you do memorial service

307
00:20:19,927 --> 00:20:22,888
for your brother

308
00:20:23,388 --> 00:20:24,640
and your wife?

309
00:20:24,973 --> 00:20:25,891
Yes.

310
00:20:26,391 --> 00:20:29,895
I thought you should come.

311
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:35,150
I will go and have a talk
with the monk here.

312
00:20:35,567 --> 00:20:38,278
You should stay inside the car.

313
00:20:38,362 --> 00:20:39,196
Okay.

314
00:20:57,673 --> 00:20:58,590
Yes.

315
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:00,884
-Please, lose some weight.
-You're skinny as a rail.

316
00:21:00,968 --> 00:21:02,844
Partner. How are you doing?

317
00:21:04,388 --> 00:21:07,683
I am leading the next
mind teaching session.

318
00:21:08,183 --> 00:21:12,020
So, I was wondering if you have
any good topics in mind.

319
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:14,773
Is that so?

320
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:18,610
A good topic? Let's see...

321
00:21:21,655 --> 00:21:22,739
Is there something wrong?

322
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:27,035
No. I will think of a good topic.

323
00:21:28,328 --> 00:21:30,080
I will call you when I do.

324
00:21:30,747 --> 00:21:31,581
Partner.

325
00:21:32,332 --> 00:21:33,375
Where are you now?

326
00:21:34,251 --> 00:21:35,419
I will go there.

327
00:21:36,461 --> 00:21:38,880
No. I'm fine.

328
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:40,173
There must be something wrong...

329
00:21:40,757 --> 00:21:42,426
Dealing with the grim reaper...

330
00:21:42,509 --> 00:21:44,094
I have already dealt with him.

331
00:21:44,177 --> 00:21:47,848
Last month, by the way, you...

332
00:21:48,724 --> 00:21:50,892
Even your ear is too fat
that you can't hear well, can you?

333
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:52,561
-Whatever.
-Mr. Kang.

334
00:21:59,901 --> 00:22:01,820
I'm the first lady of the house.

335
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:05,115
But I'm not sure of what I'm doing.

336
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:07,534
The monk said

337
00:22:07,868 --> 00:22:10,329
he needs Ms. Woo for the discussion.

338
00:22:13,373 --> 00:22:17,878
Every matter of the house
needs her approval,

339
00:22:18,837 --> 00:22:21,840
so I am like a puppet with no power.

340
00:22:48,366 --> 00:22:51,620
-You're here.
-Yes. The two are in the room.

341
00:22:53,538 --> 00:22:54,539
The two?

342
00:22:56,249 --> 00:22:58,251
Do you mean those two bastards?

343
00:22:59,544 --> 00:23:01,713
I am going to destroy
the both of them today.

344
00:23:01,797 --> 00:23:02,631
Lead the way.

345
00:23:16,311 --> 00:23:17,938
This is your first time here, right?

346
00:23:25,278 --> 00:23:26,113
Hello?

347
00:23:26,196 --> 00:23:29,991
Your husband is seeing another woman.

348
00:23:30,534 --> 00:23:32,786
Hey, don't hang up. Hello?

349
00:23:42,921 --> 00:23:45,715
The number you have
dialed cannot be reached.

350
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:54,558
I checked your number,

351
00:23:54,683 --> 00:23:57,519
so pick up the phone
or else I will call the police.

352
00:24:12,826 --> 00:24:13,785
Hello?

353
00:24:14,035 --> 00:24:15,871
Don't hang up and listen to me.

354
00:24:16,454 --> 00:24:19,416
You told me that my husband
is seeing another woman

355
00:24:19,499 --> 00:24:21,168
by texting me and calling me, right?

356
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:22,169
Yes.

357
00:24:23,003 --> 00:24:26,339
Let's meet right now
or else I'll call the police.

358
00:24:28,884 --> 00:24:29,801
It's me.

359
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:37,726
Unlock the door.

360
00:24:45,734 --> 00:24:46,693
Honey?

361
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,197
What are you doing?

362
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:52,157
What are you two doing here?

363
00:24:53,033 --> 00:24:54,326
Who is this bastard?

364
00:24:55,202 --> 00:24:57,287
We were working on marketing for blogs.

365
00:24:58,038 --> 00:24:59,122
Are you her husband?

366
00:25:00,207 --> 00:25:02,042
Yes. I'm sorry for the interruption.

367
00:25:02,959 --> 00:25:06,796
Next time, I'll go to your office
for discussion.

368
00:25:07,923 --> 00:25:11,843
I think my husband is mistaken.

369
00:25:12,177 --> 00:25:14,471
Gosh. You shouldn't have mistaken.

370
00:25:15,096 --> 00:25:17,015
Especially in this business residence.

371
00:25:17,515 --> 00:25:18,767
I don't know what to say.

372
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:35,575
Is that true?

373
00:25:36,284 --> 00:25:37,160
Yes.

374
00:25:38,078 --> 00:25:39,162
What do you want?

375
00:25:39,621 --> 00:25:40,705
I don't need anything.

376
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:44,584
I just need to pick a side.

377
00:25:49,172 --> 00:25:50,674
You've made the right choice. Take this.

378
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:54,177
Thank you.

379
00:25:54,427 --> 00:25:56,638
I'll leave now.

380
00:25:59,975 --> 00:26:00,809
Wait.

381
00:26:02,686 --> 00:26:05,146
There has to be a reason.

382
00:26:09,276 --> 00:26:10,986
Even though I have nothing,

383
00:26:11,194 --> 00:26:13,571
I still have my dignity
and I do feel anger.

384
00:26:14,864 --> 00:26:16,866
He humiliated me.

385
00:26:17,575 --> 00:26:20,245
Even if I become his slave,

386
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:22,706
I will be used and abandoned.

387
00:26:22,872 --> 00:26:25,709
But I don't think you will.

388
00:26:27,085 --> 00:26:28,003
That's it.

389
00:26:30,714 --> 00:26:32,799
God gives the power to survive

390
00:26:33,216 --> 00:26:35,885
in given circumstances

391
00:26:36,094 --> 00:26:38,847
to those who have nothing.

392
00:26:39,347 --> 00:26:43,435
Not to say that God is fair.

393
00:26:45,687 --> 00:26:47,439
They have been using separate rooms.

394
00:26:47,522 --> 00:26:49,316
I think her husband is cheating on her.

395
00:26:49,399 --> 00:26:50,900
I'm sure of it.

396
00:26:50,984 --> 00:26:54,571
I myself had someone cheat on me.

397
00:26:54,738 --> 00:26:56,573
I am an expert in this field.

398
00:26:57,032 --> 00:26:58,867
Okay, then.

399
00:26:59,617 --> 00:27:00,660
Go on.

400
00:27:01,494 --> 00:27:02,579
Yes, ma'am.

401
00:27:22,098 --> 00:27:23,475
Nurse Jeong?

402
00:27:28,813 --> 00:27:31,316
Yes, ma'am. I did it.

403
00:27:31,858 --> 00:27:34,569
You weren't joking around, were you?

404
00:27:34,778 --> 00:27:35,820
No.

405
00:27:36,363 --> 00:27:38,073
It didn't seem like it.

406
00:27:38,823 --> 00:27:40,909
Why did you do this
instead of telling me directly?

407
00:27:41,201 --> 00:27:42,035
Because...

408
00:27:42,577 --> 00:27:44,329
I didn't want to meddle
in other people's affairs.

409
00:27:46,873 --> 00:27:48,083
My father

410
00:27:48,416 --> 00:27:51,544
cheated on my mother,
so she had a hard time.

411
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,671
Everyone knew about it except you

412
00:27:54,339 --> 00:27:57,217
and no one tried to tell you.

413
00:27:57,592 --> 00:27:58,885
I'm sorry, ma'am.

414
00:28:01,012 --> 00:28:01,930
Don't be.

415
00:28:02,764 --> 00:28:04,140
Thank you.

416
00:28:06,476 --> 00:28:07,352
Then...

417
00:28:08,353 --> 00:28:10,730
Do you know who the woman is?

418
00:28:10,814 --> 00:28:12,982
I'm not sure...

419
00:28:13,775 --> 00:28:14,859
How did you find out?

420
00:28:14,943 --> 00:28:17,612
I overheard what people were saying

421
00:28:19,906 --> 00:28:22,742
and I saw her face.

422
00:28:24,411 --> 00:28:26,079
-You saw her face?
-Yes.

423
00:28:26,538 --> 00:28:27,664
Who on earth was it?

424
00:28:27,789 --> 00:28:28,873
She was a patient.

425
00:28:28,957 --> 00:28:30,875
She came to our hospital,

426
00:28:31,418 --> 00:28:33,086
but I don't know her name.

427
00:28:34,129 --> 00:28:37,006
But, I can find out.

428
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:40,385
-How?
-We have pictures of our patients.

429
00:28:41,136 --> 00:28:42,387
Before and after the surgery.

430
00:28:43,263 --> 00:28:44,514
We have hers too.

431
00:29:17,964 --> 00:29:20,091
How long have they been
using separate rooms?

432
00:29:23,219 --> 00:29:25,221
This is a matter that concerns my son.

433
00:29:25,972 --> 00:29:27,348
Speak up.

434
00:29:28,016 --> 00:29:30,810
I'm not really sure.

435
00:29:33,688 --> 00:29:37,275
How long has it been
since he cheated on her?

436
00:29:45,492 --> 00:29:47,327
Do you want to get fired?

437
00:29:49,078 --> 00:29:49,996
Speak up!

438
00:29:59,422 --> 00:30:00,965
CAREGIVER

439
00:30:06,846 --> 00:30:08,181
MESSAGE RECEIVED

440
00:30:16,773 --> 00:30:17,857
Where are you?

441
00:30:33,998 --> 00:30:37,377
If I start over,
I want to become an artist.

442
00:30:38,253 --> 00:30:39,712
You should start now.

443
00:30:40,547 --> 00:30:41,673
I am thinking about it.

444
00:30:42,507 --> 00:30:45,510
That painting was probably painted

445
00:30:45,844 --> 00:30:47,554
after it was sketched.

446
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:54,477
There are stages in every matter.

447
00:30:54,978 --> 00:30:57,647
I will let Jae-hui stay in my house.

448
00:30:59,691 --> 00:31:02,694
That is not what I want.

449
00:31:03,611 --> 00:31:05,071
We need discipline in this house.

450
00:31:05,405 --> 00:31:08,700
Rome wasn't built in a day. It takes time.

451
00:31:09,534 --> 00:31:12,120
Yes, it takes time.

452
00:31:12,745 --> 00:31:15,999
But sometimes,

453
00:31:16,457 --> 00:31:19,377
things should be rushed.

454
00:31:23,756 --> 00:31:26,050
We need to go somewhere.

455
00:31:44,193 --> 00:31:46,029
I heard that she is an artist.

456
00:31:48,156 --> 00:31:49,407
Let's go there.

457
00:31:51,034 --> 00:31:53,536
I don't know how you found out,

458
00:31:54,871 --> 00:31:56,789
but I'd rather you mind your own business.

459
00:31:57,582 --> 00:31:59,083
I'd like you to pretend you didn't know.

460
00:31:59,167 --> 00:32:01,085
What are you going to do
if Mr. Chairman finds out?

461
00:32:01,669 --> 00:32:04,130
Do you expect Mr. Chairman
to trust your husband

462
00:32:04,213 --> 00:32:06,758
in running his business when he is
distracted by such matters?

463
00:32:09,594 --> 00:32:11,721
You say that this is not my business?

464
00:32:12,388 --> 00:32:15,266
This is a matter that also concerns me.

465
00:32:16,643 --> 00:32:18,353
Because he is my son.

466
00:32:20,605 --> 00:32:21,522
Let's go.

467
00:32:22,065 --> 00:32:23,066
There's no need.

468
00:32:25,151 --> 00:32:26,277
A-jin.

469
00:32:32,116 --> 00:32:33,701
I will get my hands dirty for you.

470
00:32:34,702 --> 00:32:38,498
I'll do what you can't, A-jin.

471
00:32:43,795 --> 00:32:44,796
Let's go.

472
00:33:02,397 --> 00:33:04,607
Partner, are you all right?

473
00:33:08,194 --> 00:33:10,530
Attorney Gi-ho Kang.
The trial is about to begin.

474
00:33:10,613 --> 00:33:11,447
Okay.

475
00:33:20,289 --> 00:33:21,457
It's Room 306.

476
00:33:47,442 --> 00:33:48,317
Oh my.

477
00:33:48,901 --> 00:33:51,738
Hey!

478
00:33:52,071 --> 00:33:53,865
Who are you?

479
00:33:53,948 --> 00:33:55,116
That's not your business.

480
00:33:55,533 --> 00:33:57,410
Get out before I call the police!

481
00:33:58,494 --> 00:33:59,370
Who are you?

482
00:34:03,082 --> 00:34:05,209
Did you have an affair with Jae-seok Ahn?

483
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:07,170
Who...

484
00:34:07,336 --> 00:34:08,337
You're the one, right?

485
00:34:09,589 --> 00:34:10,757
You fucking bitch!

486
00:34:11,007 --> 00:34:14,135
How dare you mess around with someone

487
00:34:14,218 --> 00:34:16,262
who has a daughter and a wife?

488
00:34:18,181 --> 00:34:19,891
Where do you think you're going?

489
00:34:21,809 --> 00:34:23,227
You bitch!

490
00:34:26,481 --> 00:34:27,774
Come here!

491
00:34:29,317 --> 00:34:31,235
Do you want to die?

492
00:34:34,113 --> 00:34:35,531
How dare you?

493
00:34:35,823 --> 00:34:37,742
Where are you running off to?

494
00:34:38,367 --> 00:34:39,410
Stay still!

495
00:34:45,958 --> 00:34:48,961
If you don't want your face butchered,

496
00:34:49,545 --> 00:34:52,215
stop messing around with him.

497
00:34:53,132 --> 00:34:54,717
End it immediately!

498
00:34:55,885 --> 00:34:57,220
I'll be watching.

499
00:35:35,591 --> 00:35:36,968
My painting.

500
00:35:39,428 --> 00:35:40,680
My painting.

501
00:36:42,158 --> 00:36:43,117
Hello?

502
00:36:45,912 --> 00:36:46,787
Me too.

503
00:36:48,372 --> 00:36:49,582
I love you.

504
00:36:51,417 --> 00:36:52,251
Let's not

505
00:36:53,127 --> 00:36:55,671
worry about the future.

506
00:36:58,591 --> 00:36:59,884
I'll see you in the evening.

507
00:37:01,928 --> 00:37:03,054
I miss you.

508
00:37:03,304 --> 00:37:04,847
How much time will a person serve

509
00:37:05,598 --> 00:37:07,183
if one is charged
with soliciting an assault?

510
00:37:07,266 --> 00:37:10,770
Assault can be settled
between two parties.

511
00:37:11,103 --> 00:37:12,313
I will not settle.

512
00:37:12,647 --> 00:37:14,649
Do you know who it is?

513
00:37:14,815 --> 00:37:15,775
Of course.

514
00:37:21,405 --> 00:37:23,241
Please find the criminal.

515
00:37:24,283 --> 00:37:26,994
I'm going home. Yun-jae will be home soon.

516
00:37:41,384 --> 00:37:42,718
Your room is empty.

517
00:37:43,844 --> 00:37:46,555
The newcomer emptied your room.

518
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:49,183
You probably need to leave.

519
00:37:49,725 --> 00:37:51,894
What a joke.

520
00:37:52,937 --> 00:37:54,313
I know, right?

521
00:37:54,814 --> 00:37:56,941
What a joke.

522
00:38:09,912 --> 00:38:12,248
Hey. How can you take that?

523
00:38:24,593 --> 00:38:26,387
-Hello?
-Darling.

524
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:27,847
I've been hit.

525
00:38:28,222 --> 00:38:29,098
What?

526
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:31,517
I don't know who it was.

527
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:33,519
She came here uninvited,

528
00:38:33,602 --> 00:38:35,980
hit me, poured water and swore at me.

529
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:39,400
I am scared.

530
00:38:41,277 --> 00:38:43,863
Don't come. Absolutely.

531
00:38:44,113 --> 00:38:46,365
She must be around here.

532
00:38:46,991 --> 00:38:48,492
Please don't come.

533
00:38:49,994 --> 00:38:52,747
She might even be
overhearing this conversation.

534
00:38:55,458 --> 00:38:57,543
I don't know who it was.

535
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:01,547
She wasn't an old woman.

536
00:39:03,299 --> 00:39:05,217
I don't know.

537
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:13,434
Enjoy.

538
00:39:15,478 --> 00:39:16,771
Let's see.

539
00:39:36,707 --> 00:39:39,752
-Ji-hu.
-You're here, Dad.

540
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:42,046
How was your day?

541
00:39:42,463 --> 00:39:43,381
Give me a kiss.

542
00:39:43,923 --> 00:39:44,840
Did you do your homework?

543
00:39:45,424 --> 00:39:47,259
-No.
-Do it now.

544
00:39:50,846 --> 00:39:52,390
Jae-hui, why are you here?

545
00:39:52,807 --> 00:39:54,225
I am staying here from now on.

546
00:39:54,433 --> 00:39:56,018
What? Who are you to do so?

547
00:39:56,352 --> 00:39:58,771
I'm the bringer of peace.

548
00:39:58,854 --> 00:40:00,564
I've heard that you two
are using separate rooms.

549
00:40:00,815 --> 00:40:03,901
I moved all your stuff
to the main bedroom. Go on.

550
00:40:16,622 --> 00:40:18,082
CERTIFIED COPY OF PROPERTY REGISTRATION

551
00:40:18,165 --> 00:40:21,961
We'll move here and start over.

552
00:40:25,339 --> 00:40:27,383
Why is my sister here?

553
00:40:27,716 --> 00:40:29,593
She's your sister. Ask her yourself.

554
00:40:30,010 --> 00:40:32,930
A-jin. I am not going to divorce you.

555
00:40:33,764 --> 00:40:34,807
Shut up.

556
00:40:34,974 --> 00:40:37,476
I just want coexistence.

557
00:40:37,726 --> 00:40:40,396
-If you would let me...
-Get out!

558
00:40:40,938 --> 00:40:42,273
Go out and die!

559
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:44,692
A-jin. I am tired.

560
00:40:45,192 --> 00:40:46,902
I have nowhere else to go.

561
00:40:47,236 --> 00:40:49,488
Someone broke into
Seong-hui's house and hit her.

562
00:40:49,989 --> 00:40:51,073
Do you know who it was?

563
00:40:51,949 --> 00:40:53,284
Did you order it?

564
00:40:56,078 --> 00:40:57,913
You ordered it, right?

565
00:40:58,289 --> 00:40:59,665
Was it your mother?

566
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:02,334
She told me it wasn't an old woman.

567
00:41:03,586 --> 00:41:05,880
Did she get Botox?

568
00:41:13,762 --> 00:41:15,014
Are you sleeping?

569
00:41:20,978 --> 00:41:22,980
Fine.

570
00:41:24,231 --> 00:41:27,067
I'll talk to A-jin tomorrow.

571
00:41:27,902 --> 00:41:30,196
I'll give you the bank account

572
00:41:30,613 --> 00:41:32,156
that receives the rent from the factory

573
00:41:33,115 --> 00:41:36,994
and you can take care
of the memorial services in the shrine.

574
00:41:39,997 --> 00:41:42,875
From now on, you take care
of all the family affairs.

575
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:45,753
Good enough?

576
00:41:53,594 --> 00:41:56,764
All of this is for your own good.

577
00:42:04,563 --> 00:42:05,856
Come out!

578
00:42:13,489 --> 00:42:15,407
Mr. Chairman is sleeping.
What are you doing?

579
00:42:17,201 --> 00:42:19,745
You brought her here, right?

580
00:42:20,538 --> 00:42:23,791
This woman lay down next to me

581
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:25,793
while I was asleep.

582
00:42:26,335 --> 00:42:28,337
He's mistaken.

583
00:42:28,629 --> 00:42:30,381
He took my blanket, so...

584
00:42:30,464 --> 00:42:32,675
So, that's why you were going to
sleep next to me?

585
00:42:32,925 --> 00:42:35,386
No. That wasn't it, my blanket...

586
00:42:37,888 --> 00:42:38,973
Do you want to get fired?

587
00:42:39,557 --> 00:42:40,933
What do you think you are doing?

588
00:42:52,111 --> 00:42:53,153
Sorry, ma'am.

589
00:42:53,237 --> 00:42:56,031
Did you want to sleep your way to the top

590
00:42:56,490 --> 00:42:58,033
like she did?

591
00:42:59,118 --> 00:43:02,371
Didn't I tell you to watch your mouth?

592
00:43:06,125 --> 00:43:09,003
I've already killed someone before.

593
00:43:09,086 --> 00:43:11,171
First time, it's hard.
The second time, not so much.

594
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:12,923
Be careful.

595
00:43:13,591 --> 00:43:15,134
How dare you kick me out?

596
00:43:15,217 --> 00:43:18,804
Stay low if you don't want
your head blown off.

597
00:43:20,764 --> 00:43:21,724
Stop dreaming.

598
00:43:21,974 --> 00:43:25,311
You'll never get what you're after.

599
00:43:25,644 --> 00:43:28,397
You should stop dreaming.
Because you're done already.

600
00:43:33,193 --> 00:43:34,194
Shoot.

601
00:43:36,447 --> 00:43:37,364
Shoot me.

602
00:43:38,449 --> 00:43:41,410
If you don't shoot me here,
you'll look ridiculous.

603
00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:44,455
Shoot me!

604
00:43:46,874 --> 00:43:47,791
You can't do this.

605
00:43:47,916 --> 00:43:50,419
-You can't do this.
-Let go!

606
00:43:50,502 --> 00:43:52,296
-You can't do this.
-What in the hell is going on?

607
00:44:23,994 --> 00:44:25,621
Call the police, now!

608
00:44:25,954 --> 00:44:26,872
Okay, okay.

609
00:44:28,248 --> 00:44:30,042
Are you serious? The police?

610
00:44:30,459 --> 00:44:33,087
Hello? There's someone with a gun here.

611
00:44:37,758 --> 00:44:39,093
What is going on here?

612
00:45:08,664 --> 00:45:11,208
What do you think you're doing?
You had no business going in there!

613
00:45:11,417 --> 00:45:14,086
Your husband came into my room first,

614
00:45:14,503 --> 00:45:15,796
in the past.

615
00:45:16,588 --> 00:45:17,464
What?

616
00:45:17,881 --> 00:45:20,509
I thought he had something for me,

617
00:45:21,218 --> 00:45:22,511
but I guess I was mistaken.

618
00:45:22,636 --> 00:45:24,388
He really was lost.

619
00:45:24,930 --> 00:45:26,890
Sorry, I was mistaken.

620
00:45:27,808 --> 00:45:29,852
Then why do you use separate rooms?

621
00:45:30,436 --> 00:45:31,687
My gosh.

622
00:45:33,021 --> 00:45:35,065
I know who is backing you up,

623
00:45:35,899 --> 00:45:38,444
but if you flirt with my husband again,

624
00:45:39,445 --> 00:45:41,029
I'll kill you.

625
00:45:51,790 --> 00:45:52,791
INCIDENT REPORT

626
00:45:54,418 --> 00:45:55,294
So...

627
00:45:55,752 --> 00:45:58,464
You're saying that your wife
probably solicited the assault?

628
00:45:58,672 --> 00:45:59,798
Is that what you're saying?

629
00:46:00,090 --> 00:46:00,924
Yes.

630
00:46:01,925 --> 00:46:03,469
You should check her call records.

631
00:46:05,846 --> 00:46:08,056
I will never forgive her.

632
00:46:14,813 --> 00:46:16,690
Namaste.

633
00:46:25,616 --> 00:46:26,909
My husband

634
00:46:28,285 --> 00:46:29,536
is cheating on me.

635
00:46:33,499 --> 00:46:34,917
Do you know who he's seeing?

636
00:46:36,793 --> 00:46:39,171
No. I have no idea.

637
00:46:42,508 --> 00:46:44,927
I am planning on going to
the hospital to find out.

638
00:46:47,054 --> 00:46:49,181
I hate to go there.

639
00:46:49,973 --> 00:46:51,183
I know what it feels like.

640
00:46:52,559 --> 00:46:54,978
The feeling that you might have been
better off not knowing.

641
00:46:57,314 --> 00:46:59,191
How do you know that?

642
00:47:03,195 --> 00:47:04,321
Did you know about this?

643
00:47:08,909 --> 00:47:12,037
You seemed like you knew

644
00:47:12,996 --> 00:47:14,248
at the gallery bazaar.

645
00:47:14,540 --> 00:47:15,415
Let's...

646
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:20,087
stop talking about this

647
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:23,048
and let's not talk about this to others.

648
00:47:24,841 --> 00:47:26,301
Of course.

649
00:47:42,734 --> 00:47:44,236
You must be going to the police station.

650
00:47:45,404 --> 00:47:46,738
Why ask if you know the answer?

651
00:47:47,823 --> 00:47:50,284
I guess he's your husband after all.

652
00:48:07,134 --> 00:48:08,302
Can we talk over the phone?

653
00:48:16,977 --> 00:48:18,645
Hey. Did you have breakfast?

654
00:48:19,187 --> 00:48:20,397
What about you, partner?

655
00:48:20,856 --> 00:48:21,940
What about you?

656
00:48:22,357 --> 00:48:25,277
-No, not yet.
-In that case, I haven't either.

657
00:48:26,528 --> 00:48:28,947
If you haven't eaten then I haven't.

658
00:48:29,281 --> 00:48:30,866
If you have eaten then I have.

659
00:48:31,533 --> 00:48:32,784
Breakfast is like that.

660
00:48:35,370 --> 00:48:37,080
How about brunch at a fantastic place?

661
00:48:40,626 --> 00:48:43,378
Eat. This is real brunch.

662
00:48:43,462 --> 00:48:45,631
I love bean sprout soup.

663
00:48:46,089 --> 00:48:46,965
Me too.

664
00:48:49,551 --> 00:48:52,179
Did you read all my poems?

665
00:48:52,804 --> 00:48:54,389
Yes, quite a bit.

666
00:48:55,182 --> 00:48:58,393
It's quite sentimental, romantic,

667
00:48:58,685 --> 00:49:02,147
logical and great, isn't it?

668
00:49:02,606 --> 00:49:04,066
It was perfect.

669
00:49:06,818 --> 00:49:08,320
You look like a child when you smile.

670
00:49:10,072 --> 00:49:13,033
Looking like a child is not a compliment.

671
00:49:13,659 --> 00:49:14,868
It's not an insult, either.

672
00:49:17,537 --> 00:49:18,580
Try and imitate me.

673
00:49:24,503 --> 00:49:25,379
You smiled.

674
00:49:25,587 --> 00:49:27,589
Look how pretty you are when you smile.

675
00:49:27,881 --> 00:49:30,258
Don't you know that you look

676
00:49:30,592 --> 00:49:32,928
exactly 4.5 times prettier than usual
when you smile?

677
00:49:33,929 --> 00:49:36,848
Of course I know that.
That's why I don't smile.

678
00:49:36,932 --> 00:49:38,308
Because people fall in love with me.

679
00:49:39,434 --> 00:49:41,520
That's quite something
to be worried about!

680
00:49:42,896 --> 00:49:44,648
Eat. Your brunch is getting cold, partner.

681
00:49:59,121 --> 00:50:00,956
-Welcome.
-Thank you.

682
00:50:15,512 --> 00:50:16,638
Who did it?

683
00:50:17,347 --> 00:50:19,349
That's what I was going to ask you.

684
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:20,976
Oh my.

685
00:50:21,101 --> 00:50:21,977
Look!

686
00:50:22,310 --> 00:50:25,856
This is attempted murder
on top of illegal possession of weapons.

687
00:50:25,939 --> 00:50:28,525
It was an accidental fire.
It was not an attempted murder.

688
00:50:30,652 --> 00:50:34,239
How can I meet the head of the gallery
today with this face?

689
00:50:34,990 --> 00:50:37,659
She was too strong.

690
00:50:37,993 --> 00:50:41,496
Every part of my body hurts like hell.

691
00:50:41,747 --> 00:50:43,832
Should I call the police?
They can find out who did it.

692
00:50:43,915 --> 00:50:45,083
Do you want everyone to know?

693
00:50:45,167 --> 00:50:47,461
We need to find out,
so that we can punish the woman.

694
00:50:47,586 --> 00:50:50,422
Only A-jin knows about us.

695
00:50:51,298 --> 00:50:53,258
Manager Park also knows.

696
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:56,887
Maybe it's one of your acquaintances.

697
00:50:56,970 --> 00:50:58,472
Do you think they have a reason
to do this?

698
00:50:58,555 --> 00:51:00,599
They don't. She must be one of yours.

699
00:51:02,017 --> 00:51:02,851
Darling.

700
00:51:03,268 --> 00:51:05,187
Are you meeting someone else,
instead of me?

701
00:51:05,979 --> 00:51:07,606
No way, right?

702
00:51:07,689 --> 00:51:09,941
What kind of a person do you think I am?

703
00:51:10,317 --> 00:51:12,277
There are ethics in cheating.

704
00:51:13,445 --> 00:51:14,863
Then who was it?

705
00:51:15,197 --> 00:51:17,491
-Was she pretty?
-I don't know.

706
00:51:19,743 --> 00:51:20,619
Hey.

707
00:51:21,036 --> 00:51:23,747
Why don't you paint her face?
You're an artist.

708
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:25,290
Let's sketch her face!

709
00:51:26,124 --> 00:51:27,042
Hey, there!

710
00:51:27,667 --> 00:51:30,003
Do you have a sketchbook and a 4B pencil?

711
00:51:32,714 --> 00:51:35,008
How about a piece of paper

712
00:51:35,675 --> 00:51:38,220
and a regular pencil?

713
00:51:42,057 --> 00:51:43,141
Then...

714
00:51:43,725 --> 00:51:46,895
How about a memo and a pen?

715
00:51:47,771 --> 00:51:48,605
Do you have them?

716
00:51:48,688 --> 00:51:50,357
Don't you know that the law has changed?

717
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:52,526
It's illegal for individuals
to possess air guns.

718
00:51:52,734 --> 00:51:54,361
It must be kept in the police station.

719
00:51:55,695 --> 00:51:57,531
This person was in the United States.

720
00:51:57,906 --> 00:51:59,449
He didn't know that the law has changed.

721
00:51:59,533 --> 00:52:03,662
I received the notice,
but I couldn't reach him.

722
00:52:04,162 --> 00:52:07,749
I couldn't hand it in because
I didn't know where it was.

723
00:52:07,833 --> 00:52:11,920
The problem is that the gun
was fired in a residential house.

724
00:52:12,003 --> 00:52:15,549
I was there. It was a mistake.

725
00:52:15,632 --> 00:52:16,883
No one was hurt.

726
00:52:16,967 --> 00:52:19,761
How can it be an attempted murder
if there's no harm done?

727
00:52:20,762 --> 00:52:22,222
Unbelievable.

728
00:53:41,009 --> 00:53:42,719
Why?

729
00:54:12,082 --> 00:54:13,249
Sorry.

730
00:54:14,084 --> 00:54:16,044
Didn't I tell you
to only do the things I say?

731
00:54:17,212 --> 00:54:18,296
You did.

732
00:54:18,630 --> 00:54:20,632
Then why did you do such a thing?

733
00:54:21,758 --> 00:54:25,470
Did I inspire you
to do what you did, or what?

734
00:54:27,138 --> 00:54:28,348
It was just

735
00:54:29,307 --> 00:54:31,643
a lifelong habit of mine.

736
00:54:34,521 --> 00:54:35,355
Get out.

737
00:54:36,231 --> 00:54:37,357
Quit this job.

738
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:39,859
You don't have the discipline.

739
00:54:39,943 --> 00:54:40,902
Cho-hui.

740
00:54:42,612 --> 00:54:43,738
Bok-ja.

741
00:54:45,198 --> 00:54:46,074
I mean,

742
00:54:47,075 --> 00:54:48,451
ma'am!

743
00:54:51,746 --> 00:54:55,041
Please. Forgive me just once.

744
00:55:00,213 --> 00:55:01,089
I will

745
00:55:04,884 --> 00:55:06,177
give you another chance.

746
00:55:08,471 --> 00:55:09,597
I'll keep an eye on you.

747
00:55:10,265 --> 00:55:11,141
Thank you.

748
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:18,231
Go see your kids this weekend.

749
00:55:19,399 --> 00:55:20,233
Go on.

750
00:55:23,653 --> 00:55:26,322
By the way, are you pregnant?

751
00:55:51,765 --> 00:55:54,184
It's me. I heard some news.

752
00:55:54,267 --> 00:55:55,727
Come to my gallery.

753
00:55:58,229 --> 00:55:59,397
I think

754
00:55:59,981 --> 00:56:02,358
I'm too scared to go back to that house.

755
00:56:02,692 --> 00:56:04,944
Don't worry. I'll buy you a new house.

756
00:56:06,613 --> 00:56:07,447
Really?

757
00:56:07,864 --> 00:56:10,784
A-jin bought it for me,
but the house is under my name.

758
00:56:11,826 --> 00:56:13,119
We'll meet there from now on.

759
00:56:13,203 --> 00:56:15,080
Only A-jin and I know about that place.

760
00:56:15,163 --> 00:56:17,916
Darling, you're the best.

761
00:56:20,543 --> 00:56:22,337
Look how happy you are.

762
00:56:24,964 --> 00:56:25,924
You were looking for me?

763
00:56:27,342 --> 00:56:30,470
I heard something strange from someone.

764
00:56:31,096 --> 00:56:33,098
Seong-hui Yun and your husband...

765
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:38,686
Are they together? Is that true?

766
00:56:43,650 --> 00:56:46,903
She had a bruise on her face
when she came to say hello.

767
00:56:48,113 --> 00:56:51,116
Did you hit her?

768
00:56:51,825 --> 00:56:52,700
No.

769
00:56:53,118 --> 00:56:55,286
Just tell me.

770
00:56:55,829 --> 00:56:59,833
I don't want pictures drawn from an artist
who messes around with married men.

771
00:57:02,418 --> 00:57:03,545
I can take them down.

772
00:57:06,714 --> 00:57:08,508
No. Just leave it.

773
00:57:09,884 --> 00:57:10,927
Don't take them down.

774
00:57:13,096 --> 00:57:17,225
That place was a battlefield
bombarded with

775
00:57:17,308 --> 00:57:18,518
desires and pleasure.

776
00:57:43,251 --> 00:57:46,421
I just happened to leave

777
00:57:47,005 --> 00:57:48,631
the deadly mess

778
00:57:49,174 --> 00:57:51,301
earlier than others.

779
00:58:12,113 --> 00:58:14,657
She visited me at the gym and gave me
an envelope with cash inside.

780
00:58:14,741 --> 00:58:17,577
To make sure she can no longer work
as a caregiver. She told me to hurt her.

781
00:58:17,660 --> 00:58:20,205
Father, he's framing me.
I never did such a thing.

782
00:58:20,288 --> 00:58:23,291
Truth doesn't always win in this world.

783
00:58:23,791 --> 00:58:26,252
What wins becomes the truth.

784
00:58:26,336 --> 00:58:29,380
You spoiled, clueless rich woman.

785
00:58:30,215 --> 00:58:32,884
You should look after everything
in the house from now on.

786
00:58:32,967 --> 00:58:35,261
We're planning to move out.

787
00:58:35,345 --> 00:58:37,972
Did your abusive husband
make you miss being with a sweet guy?

788
00:58:38,056 --> 00:58:40,391
-I am pregnant.
-Is that why you seduced my husband?

789
00:58:40,475 --> 00:58:41,935
That's right. I seduced him.

790
00:58:44,687 --> 00:58:45,813
My name is Bok...

791
00:58:45,897 --> 00:58:48,024
I'm Ji-yeong Park.

792
00:58:48,233 --> 00:58:49,275
There's only one left now.

793
00:58:49,442 --> 00:58:51,027
What will you do
about the younger son's wife?

794
00:58:51,236 --> 00:58:55,114
You may find it hard to believe,
but I like you, A-jin.

795
00:58:56,157 --> 00:58:57,075
Yes.

796
00:58:57,283 --> 00:59:00,161
Is it your child? It's not, right?

797
00:59:00,912 --> 00:59:03,748
Who are you going
to live with at that house?

798
00:59:04,415 --> 00:59:06,543
A-jin!

799
00:59:06,626 --> 00:59:07,794
-You bastard!
-Dad!

800
00:59:07,877 --> 00:59:09,003
Have you been cheating on A-jin?

801
00:59:10,421 --> 00:59:11,589
You almost ripped my mouth off.

802
00:59:11,673 --> 00:59:15,093
I love you. I don't want a divorce.

803
00:59:15,468 --> 00:59:16,761
Try to be cool about it, okay?

804
00:59:16,928 --> 00:59:18,888
Just accept it.

805
00:59:19,639 --> 00:59:21,641
