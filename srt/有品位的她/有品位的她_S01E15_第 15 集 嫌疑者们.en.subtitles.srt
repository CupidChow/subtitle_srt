1
00:00:40,832 --> 00:00:44,627
Since the company is doing so well now,
you should sell it

2
00:00:44,711 --> 00:00:46,755
and keep the cash.

3
00:00:46,963 --> 00:00:50,091
Are you saying the company has been
passed over to your stepmother?

4
00:00:50,175 --> 00:00:52,010
Only their second eldest son
knows about this.

5
00:00:52,093 --> 00:00:56,014
Plus, he probably has no idea
about the share disposal.

6
00:00:56,139 --> 00:00:58,141
Don't trust Bok-ja Park too much.

7
00:00:58,683 --> 00:01:01,352
As I watched from close proximity,
I didn't think this was right...

8
00:01:01,603 --> 00:01:05,774
It's difficult to be accepted
as a member of Seven Princesses.

9
00:01:05,857 --> 00:01:08,777
They're all women who possess
moral influence and intelligence.

10
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:10,320
How much are you going to sell it for?

11
00:01:10,403 --> 00:01:11,863
I want 75 billion won in cash.

12
00:01:12,405 --> 00:01:14,324
Sir, Ms. Park sold

13
00:01:15,033 --> 00:01:19,037
all of the company shares
to a private equity fund.

14
00:01:19,245 --> 00:01:21,539
And since then, no one has been able to

15
00:01:22,665 --> 00:01:23,625
get a hold of her.

16
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:32,944
She died from TBI.

17
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:36,489
There's nothing that shows she was raped.
There are no signs of resistance either.

18
00:02:38,074 --> 00:02:40,034
The killer hit her here twice
with a blunt weapon.

19
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:41,828
The artery ruptured right away.

20
00:02:43,371 --> 00:02:45,081
We don't even have any space
to store the body.

21
00:02:45,373 --> 00:02:46,583
Please get her transferred soon.

22
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:50,879
Okay.

23
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:09,063
Who do you think did it?

24
00:03:10,815 --> 00:03:12,150
I thought it was her, but I was wrong.

25
00:03:12,567 --> 00:03:14,319
She's the only one with a firm alibi.

26
00:03:18,156 --> 00:03:19,407
Where can I take you, ma'am?

27
00:03:19,782 --> 00:03:21,534
-Gwangun Hospital, please.
-Sure.

28
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:27,373
SEOUL INSTITUTE
OF SCIENTIFIC INVESTIGATION

29
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:30,043
NFS' official autopsy report
won't be released until three weeks later,

30
00:03:30,126 --> 00:03:33,171
but we know she died of brain hemorrhage
caused by a blunt weapon.

31
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:36,966
The time of death is presumed to be
at around 2 a.m. on February 28th.

32
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:41,387
The first call to the police was made
at 9:17 a.m. that day.

33
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:43,640
Next, I'll go over
who's on our list of suspects.

34
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:45,141
Tae-dong Ahn.

35
00:03:45,266 --> 00:03:48,811
Ji-yeong Park's husband who certainly has
enough motive to kill her.

36
00:03:49,145 --> 00:03:52,232
I rarely see you these days
because you're so busy.

37
00:03:52,982 --> 00:03:54,984
My life is so boring and dull
without you around.

38
00:03:55,193 --> 00:03:57,403
The company has to operate
like a well-oiled machine

39
00:03:57,528 --> 00:04:00,990
for you to feel at ease
and live a stress-free life.

40
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:03,201
I can't part ways with you.

41
00:04:03,284 --> 00:04:05,703
-Why do you say that...
-I trust you.

42
00:04:05,787 --> 00:04:09,499
Why does that keep sounding
like you can't trust me?

43
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:13,002
Jae-gu Ahn.
He's Tae-dong Ahn's eldest child.

44
00:04:13,127 --> 00:04:16,214
He threatened Ji-yeong Park multiple times
before she died.

45
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:18,091
He was even charged with attempted murder.

46
00:04:18,341 --> 00:04:20,635
He's definitely one of our prime suspects.

47
00:04:20,718 --> 00:04:23,429
I've already killed someone before.

48
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:25,640
First time, it's hard.
The second time, not so much.

49
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:27,934
Hey, you bitch.
Are you looking down on me?

50
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:30,770
Do you think you can just kick
my wife and child out of the house?

51
00:04:30,853 --> 00:04:31,854
Jae-hui Ahn.

52
00:04:32,146 --> 00:04:34,983
She's Tae-dong Ahn's second child.
Even though she was

53
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:37,318
in the same space as the victim
on the day of the incident,

54
00:04:37,402 --> 00:04:39,654
she lied in her statement
by saying that she wasn't with her.

55
00:04:39,904 --> 00:04:42,407
Hey. Fix a meal for me.

56
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:45,243
-I'm a caregiver.
-So, what?

57
00:04:45,326 --> 00:04:48,371
Jae-hui, you're old enough.

58
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:51,165
-Don't throw a tantrum.
-What did you say?

59
00:04:51,249 --> 00:04:55,003
Should I scrub the bathroom floor
with soap so she'll slip and die?

60
00:04:55,211 --> 00:04:57,964
Ju-mi Park. She's married
to Tae-dong Ahn's eldest son.

61
00:04:58,047 --> 00:05:01,592
She has no alibi for the day of the murder
and the statements

62
00:05:01,843 --> 00:05:04,804
we received from people around the victim
make her one of our prime suspects.

63
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:07,432
He's putting on a show, Father.

64
00:05:08,224 --> 00:05:10,643
I bet he's colluding with this woman.

65
00:05:10,893 --> 00:05:12,186
She's the mastermind behind it.

66
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:15,273
Shut up! How dare you spew such nonsense?

67
00:05:15,356 --> 00:05:17,108
If you can't do that,
do something before you go.

68
00:05:17,191 --> 00:05:18,151
At least...

69
00:05:19,777 --> 00:05:21,195
kill that woman before you go.

70
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:23,156
Bang-soon Cheon.

71
00:05:23,281 --> 00:05:26,326
Ji-yeong Park worked with her
at a bar in her hometown.

72
00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:29,454
I'll become your eyes and ears
as you want.

73
00:05:29,537 --> 00:05:32,540
I trust you. You know that, right?

74
00:05:33,249 --> 00:05:35,626
Then, what are your plans afterward?

75
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:37,253
Don't ask me things like that anymore.

76
00:05:37,336 --> 00:05:41,257
Also, call me "Ma'am"
even when it's just the two of us.

77
00:05:41,466 --> 00:05:44,427
In her statement,
she said she felt so betrayed

78
00:05:44,594 --> 00:05:46,512
by Ji-yeong Park
that she would have killed her herself

79
00:05:46,846 --> 00:05:48,681
even if she hadn't been killed.

80
00:05:49,807 --> 00:05:52,226
We plan to have her take a polygraph test.

81
00:05:52,435 --> 00:05:53,478
Bong-cheol Gu.

82
00:05:54,437 --> 00:05:57,607
He and Ji-yeong Park grew up together
like siblings at the same orphanage.

83
00:05:57,857 --> 00:06:01,527
He has fallen off the grid though.
We've put out an APB on him.

84
00:06:01,944 --> 00:06:03,696
We must not let her go any further

85
00:06:04,405 --> 00:06:06,157
or have her way.

86
00:06:07,325 --> 00:06:08,618
Cripple her.

87
00:06:10,119 --> 00:06:12,830
This is Min-gi Han, the CEO of MK Capital.

88
00:06:12,914 --> 00:06:16,334
We're not sure if this man
is Ji-yeong Park's ally

89
00:06:16,417 --> 00:06:18,920
or if he has
a hostile relationship with her.

90
00:06:19,003 --> 00:06:21,923
Hello. I'm Min-gi Han,
the CEO of MK Capital.

91
00:06:22,173 --> 00:06:24,509
There is a group of ladies
that gather regularly.

92
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:26,511
They call themselves Seven Princesses.

93
00:06:27,136 --> 00:06:28,638
Ji-yeong Park's call history shows

94
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:30,640
that she spoke to him
before she was killed.

95
00:06:31,307 --> 00:06:32,141
He's...

96
00:06:35,019 --> 00:06:36,979
Detective Lee, Ms. A-jin Woo is here.

97
00:06:38,773 --> 00:06:42,610
Were you with Ms. Ji-yeong Park
the day Chairman Ahn collapsed?

98
00:06:43,611 --> 00:06:45,905
No, I wasn't.

99
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:48,157
I heard that she attended

100
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:50,701
your divorce trial.

101
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:54,038
You called Ms. Park and asked her
to meet up, right?

102
00:06:54,122 --> 00:06:54,956
Yes, I did.

103
00:06:55,623 --> 00:06:58,042
She left right after the trial though.

104
00:06:58,376 --> 00:07:01,254
I tried calling her again,
but I wasn't able to get a hold of her.

105
00:07:01,337 --> 00:07:04,006
Then, how did you manage
to get a hold of her after that?

106
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:13,516
Let me summarize
what you've told me so far.

107
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:16,811
Ms. Park got all of Chairman Ahn's
company shares

108
00:07:16,894 --> 00:07:18,896
transferred to herself, sold them,

109
00:07:19,021 --> 00:07:21,232
cashed them, and disappeared.

110
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:25,027
Then, why did she change her mind
all of a sudden

111
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:27,447
and come back home?
That's what I'm wondering.

112
00:07:30,408 --> 00:07:32,201
Matisse and Kandinsky.

113
00:07:33,744 --> 00:07:37,081
That's what made her come back.

114
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:40,751
As per the plaintiff A-jin Woo's request,

115
00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:43,087
I hereby declare that their marriage
is now dissolved.

116
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:02,315
-Hello?
-Ms. Woo.

117
00:08:02,523 --> 00:08:04,650
-Ms. Park.
-Mr. Chairman has collapsed.

118
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:07,153
Mr. Chairman has collapsed.

119
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:19,916
I won't go back.

120
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:20,833
Ms. Park.

121
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:26,130
Please take good care of Mr. Chairman.

122
00:08:30,676 --> 00:08:33,554
Mr. Kim, have you been able
to get a hold of Ms. Park yet?

123
00:08:33,888 --> 00:08:35,181
Well, it's...

124
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:37,892
It doesn't look like she'll come back.

125
00:08:37,975 --> 00:08:39,435
You've known about it, haven't you?

126
00:08:40,144 --> 00:08:42,271
I bet you have. How much did she pay you?

127
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:44,607
No, Mr. Oh.
Please don't get the wrong idea.

128
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:46,526
-Wrong idea?
-Ms. Park told me

129
00:08:46,609 --> 00:08:48,569
that if I keep her updated
on everything he's up to...

130
00:08:48,653 --> 00:08:49,820
Then, what?

131
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:52,782
If I keep her updated on everything,

132
00:08:55,117 --> 00:08:57,870
she said that she'd raise
my monthly salary by one million won.

133
00:08:58,037 --> 00:08:59,038
One million won?

134
00:08:59,747 --> 00:09:00,957
One million won?

135
00:09:01,499 --> 00:09:03,918
-Don't lie to my face.
-I'm telling you the truth.

136
00:09:04,252 --> 00:09:06,629
What is going on?
Did she betray Mr. Chairman

137
00:09:06,837 --> 00:09:08,548
and run away after selling all the shares?

138
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:09,924
Jeez.

139
00:09:10,716 --> 00:09:14,512
All of us started to distrust
and question each other.

140
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:17,682
Because of what she had done,
we could no longer tell

141
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:20,685
what was true and what was fake.

142
00:09:20,768 --> 00:09:21,936
Gosh, Ms. Cheon.

143
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:24,397
What are you doing?

144
00:09:25,022 --> 00:09:26,732
I'm leaving.

145
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:28,985
Ms. Park told me to leave.

146
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:30,444
Gosh, I'm speechless.

147
00:09:30,945 --> 00:09:32,947
I guess you're leaving
because you've achieved your goal.

148
00:09:33,447 --> 00:09:34,323
What?

149
00:09:35,741 --> 00:09:37,034
You can't go anywhere.

150
00:09:37,451 --> 00:09:40,454
-Why are you being like this?
-Ms. Park!

151
00:09:41,205 --> 00:09:43,291
Ms. Park, this woman is running away.

152
00:09:43,749 --> 00:09:45,293
How shameless.

153
00:09:45,376 --> 00:09:47,753
-Where's Bok-ja Park?
-I don't know.

154
00:09:48,838 --> 00:09:51,632
-Ma'am...
-Shut up. You must know everything.

155
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:54,510
She sold the company and ran away.

156
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:57,430
She sold the company
for 75 billion won in cash.

157
00:09:58,306 --> 00:09:59,265
Did you say 75...

158
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:04,312
Tell me where Bok-ja Park is.
Isn't that where you're going?

159
00:10:04,562 --> 00:10:05,896
How much is she giving you?

160
00:10:06,772 --> 00:10:09,734
Ma'am, I told Mr. Chairman about her past

161
00:10:09,817 --> 00:10:12,236
like you had asked me to do.

162
00:10:12,653 --> 00:10:14,071
Why are you doing this to me?

163
00:10:14,155 --> 00:10:15,364
Do you think I'd have no idea?

164
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:18,242
You're the type
to turn your coat as you please.

165
00:10:19,243 --> 00:10:22,163
Ms. Jo told me that she saw you
speaking with her!

166
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:28,669
-I won't have a baby.
-You wanted a baby though.

167
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:30,129
I had a change of heart.

168
00:10:30,379 --> 00:10:34,091
I've found a faster way
than using the baby to cash in.

169
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:36,302
Then, what are your plans afterward?

170
00:10:39,221 --> 00:10:40,848
-Ms. Jo.
-Yes, ma'am.

171
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:42,475
This woman is her accomplice.

172
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:45,102
Make sure she can't even
step out of the house.

173
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:50,441
What a bat.

174
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:53,110
Gosh, I can't believe this.

175
00:11:01,619 --> 00:11:02,620
What's going on?

176
00:11:03,037 --> 00:11:04,205
How much did you get?

177
00:11:04,914 --> 00:11:05,748
What do you mean?

178
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:08,084
-We heard you sold the company!
-What?

179
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:10,628
You punk, how dare you eat up
the company all by yourself?

180
00:11:10,711 --> 00:11:12,296
What on earth are you talking about?

181
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:15,174
The company has been sold.
You must have known about it!

182
00:11:15,257 --> 00:11:16,884
No one sold the company.

183
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:20,721
Dad gave all of his shares
to that woman. That's all.

184
00:11:27,186 --> 00:11:28,104
Did something else happen?

185
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:31,690
Ms. Park sold all of those shares off
to a private equity fund.

186
00:11:31,816 --> 00:11:33,984
-What?
-Mr. Chairman told her to do so.

187
00:11:34,068 --> 00:11:35,653
Mr. Park, who told you that?

188
00:11:35,736 --> 00:11:37,696
The shareholders came by
and caused a scene earlier.

189
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:39,949
They'll have
an emergency meeting in a bit.

190
00:11:40,032 --> 00:11:43,869
How come no one told me about any of this?
They can't do whatever they want!

191
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:46,247
She sold the company?
Who does she think she is?

192
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:48,749
Look at you. You're a pretty good actor.

193
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:50,292
How could you have not known about it?

194
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:52,586
You little prick.
You're one of the shareholders!

195
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:56,048
Do you think I'll believe
they didn't discuss it with you at all?

196
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:58,467
My goodness,
why are you guys doing this to me?

197
00:11:59,176 --> 00:12:00,886
I just got divorced.

198
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:02,721
That's not important now, you moron!

199
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:04,265
Give us our shares!

200
00:12:04,348 --> 00:12:06,434
I just got divorced for God's sake.

201
00:12:06,517 --> 00:12:08,060
Why are you guys doing this to me?

202
00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:09,728
Where is Dad?

203
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:11,605
He collapsed and now is at the hospital.

204
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:13,983
Gosh.

205
00:12:16,318 --> 00:12:17,194
What?

206
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:27,580
Father.

207
00:12:37,131 --> 00:12:38,048
Ms. Woo.

208
00:12:38,757 --> 00:12:39,842
You can't get a hold of her?

209
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:41,385
She said she won't come.

210
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:44,472
What's happening with the company?

211
00:12:45,097 --> 00:12:46,682
Has it really been bought out?

212
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:49,185
From what I know,
all of the shares Mr. Chairman used to own

213
00:12:49,643 --> 00:12:51,187
have been sold.

214
00:12:54,106 --> 00:12:56,108
I heard that it was Father's decision.

215
00:12:57,526 --> 00:12:58,444
Is it true?

216
00:12:59,695 --> 00:13:02,907
Lawyer Kim is speaking
with the shareholders at the moment.

217
00:13:07,161 --> 00:13:10,039
This contract here proves
that Mr. Chairman gave all of his shares

218
00:13:10,206 --> 00:13:12,541
to his wife, Bok-ja Park...

219
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:13,667
I mean, Ms. Ji-yeong Park.

220
00:13:14,376 --> 00:13:17,838
We know that, but we heard
that woman sold the company right away.

221
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:20,841
To whom did she sell it?
She obviously did it behind Dad's back.

222
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:23,636
Mr. Chairman was the one
who wanted to sell the company.

223
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:26,597
No way. That can't be.

224
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:49,620
As you can all see,

225
00:13:49,995 --> 00:13:52,581
MK Capital is now
the majority shareholder of Daesung Pulp.

226
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:56,126
Since the CEO position is vacant
at the moment, I will temporarily act

227
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:58,921
as the company's CEO until the board
finds a management specialist.

228
00:13:59,213 --> 00:14:02,007
This is crazy. This is absolutely insane.

229
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:05,928
Who told you that you can run
my dad's company?

230
00:14:06,303 --> 00:14:08,973
-Who do you think you are?
-My company legally set up

231
00:14:09,056 --> 00:14:12,601
the fund and bought Daesung Pulp
at the highest price it can get.

232
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:16,522
The payment was made to the majority
shareholder, Ms. Ji-yeong Park.

233
00:14:16,647 --> 00:14:18,399
-Since Daesung Pulp is unlisted...
-Ji-yeong Park?

234
00:14:18,482 --> 00:14:20,609
-She changed her name.
-MK Capital doesn't need to seek

235
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:24,530
a unanimous shareholder agreement
in order for its rights to commence.

236
00:14:24,947 --> 00:14:25,865
That's all for now.

237
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:29,827
This can't happen. I mean, I had no idea.

238
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:31,328
What the hell is this?

239
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:36,834
So, you know where she is now?

240
00:14:37,251 --> 00:14:39,003
I tracked the location of her cell phone.

241
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:43,340
What would you like to do
about Bok-ja Park?

242
00:14:47,094 --> 00:14:48,095
What should I do?

243
00:14:50,055 --> 00:14:51,056
Let's kill her.

244
00:14:53,809 --> 00:14:54,935
We have to kill her.

245
00:14:56,353 --> 00:14:58,063
That's the only way.

246
00:15:17,499 --> 00:15:21,712
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven,

247
00:15:21,795 --> 00:15:24,048
eight, nine...

248
00:15:42,107 --> 00:15:43,359
-Hello?
-Where are you?

249
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:46,236
I'm on my way to catch her.
I got the location of her phone.

250
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,238
What will you do after catching her?

251
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:50,282
We must get the money back at all costs.

252
00:15:51,408 --> 00:15:53,577
I'll beat her up to a pulp first.

253
00:15:53,744 --> 00:15:57,081
Forget it. I'll go get her.
Just tell me where she is.

254
00:15:57,164 --> 00:15:58,374
You don't need to do that.

255
00:15:58,999 --> 00:16:00,459
You've been exposed too many times.

256
00:16:00,542 --> 00:16:02,795
Plus, you've failed every single time.

257
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:04,588
This time, I'll do it myself.

258
00:16:06,298 --> 00:16:09,677
I'll just kill her
if I can't get through to her.

259
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:14,014
Who do you think will inherit the money
if that woman dies?

260
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:16,433
Father will get it all back.

261
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:19,061
We must do it if it's the only way.

262
00:16:20,187 --> 00:16:21,981
Where is that bitch right now?

263
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:26,318
Jae-gu.

264
00:16:27,945 --> 00:16:28,779
Jae-gu!

265
00:16:31,907 --> 00:16:33,283
Did you really get divorced?

266
00:16:35,786 --> 00:16:36,787
I'm seriously devastated.

267
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:38,580
You're such an idiot.

268
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:43,335
By the way, Dad collapsed.
Who's at the hospital now?

269
00:17:05,566 --> 00:17:07,276
A-JIN WOO

270
00:17:11,155 --> 00:17:13,824
The customer you're calling
is unavailable at the moment. Please...

271
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:25,044
Goodness.

272
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:26,462
Could this be it?

273
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:29,548
"Jae-seok Ahn and Seong-hui Yun
have agreed to the following.

274
00:17:29,631 --> 00:17:32,009
First, Jae-seok Ahn
is the owner of the real estate property.

275
00:17:32,176 --> 00:17:36,138
Second, Ahn transfers the equitable title
of the property to his trustee, Yun."

276
00:17:36,221 --> 00:17:37,806
My gosh, this is it.

277
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:41,310
Goodness, you're not smart after all.
Why on earth did you sign this thing?

278
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:44,188
He said that we need to sign this
to make it more concrete.

279
00:17:44,396 --> 00:17:45,397
Gosh, what should I do now?

280
00:17:45,481 --> 00:17:49,401
Jeez, he seemed so dumb.
I'm surprised he covered all the bases.

281
00:17:49,485 --> 00:17:50,486
What should I do?

282
00:17:50,861 --> 00:17:53,155
He must have another copy of this.

283
00:17:53,655 --> 00:17:56,492
All problems will be solved
if we find it and get rid of it, right?

284
00:17:56,700 --> 00:18:00,621
You're right. Then, I'll look for it
in his wife's room.

285
00:18:01,288 --> 00:18:02,873
The housekeeper is here.

286
00:18:11,882 --> 00:18:12,841
Sorry to bother you.

287
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:16,804
I have a bad headache. Do you mind
picking up some medicine for me?

288
00:18:17,262 --> 00:18:20,557
You nut head. Why should I step out
and pick up medicine for you?

289
00:18:20,641 --> 00:18:23,227
How uncouth.
Do you have to talk like that?

290
00:18:23,393 --> 00:18:24,561
Whatever.

291
00:18:24,686 --> 00:18:26,897
Don't be like that. Please do it for me.

292
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:28,774
You've been racking
that sly brain of yours.

293
00:18:29,024 --> 00:18:30,484
Of course, it will shut down.

294
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:32,444
No wonder why you have a headache.

295
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:35,322
Gosh, my head...

296
00:18:50,712 --> 00:18:53,590
-Does it hurt a lot?
-Gosh, it's splitting.

297
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:56,009
Really? Then, go and see who's here.

298
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:57,886
It'll completely get rid of your headache.

299
00:18:59,513 --> 00:19:00,722
Who is here?

300
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:09,565
"Campaign for Better
Residential Environment"?

301
00:19:10,941 --> 00:19:14,945
We'd like to speak with the mistress
that lives here.

302
00:19:15,529 --> 00:19:18,198
Pardon? Who are you referring to?

303
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:20,242
She's her mom.

304
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:22,911
Who are you ladies?

305
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:27,332
I'm the chairwoman of the Campaign
for Better Residential Environment.

306
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:29,751
We'd like to speak with the mistress.

307
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,461
Please let us talk to her directly.

308
00:19:31,545 --> 00:19:32,629
What is going on?

309
00:19:34,423 --> 00:19:37,092
-What do you ladies want?
-UN Top Village has been named

310
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:39,052
the best residential complex
in the whole country

311
00:19:39,136 --> 00:19:40,179
for two consecutive years

312
00:19:40,262 --> 00:19:42,556
since I was elected
to represent our residents.

313
00:19:42,639 --> 00:19:45,142
It's known as a premium-class,
prestigious residential complex.

314
00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:47,978
In other words, this crazy situation
where a wife and a mistress

315
00:19:48,061 --> 00:19:50,606
are living together in our building
has significantly damaged

316
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:54,109
the complex's image and reputation,
and I absolutely cannot condone

317
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:56,403
such ridiculousness
as the representative of all residents.

318
00:19:56,904 --> 00:19:58,363
-What did you just say?
-Take pictures.

319
00:20:01,325 --> 00:20:03,035
What do you think you're doing now?

320
00:20:03,118 --> 00:20:06,371
Look, you are breaking the law now.
Are you aware of it or not?

321
00:20:06,455 --> 00:20:08,707
Of course, we're aware of it.

322
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:11,335
You have no right to do this to me.

323
00:20:11,585 --> 00:20:14,963
You're violating the law by taking
pictures of me and invading my property.

324
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:18,133
Do you all want to end up in jail or what?

325
00:20:18,967 --> 00:20:20,135
Oh, my goodness.

326
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:23,805
I see that mistresses these days
are different.

327
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:25,432
They're definitely smart.

328
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:27,476
-How smart.
-How smart.

329
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:30,771
Hey, you mistress!
Move out of our building immediately!

330
00:20:30,854 --> 00:20:32,606
-What?
-We'll give you exactly 15 days.

331
00:20:32,689 --> 00:20:34,858
If you don't move out by then,
we'll disseminate these photos.

332
00:20:34,942 --> 00:20:37,277
You talked about the law earlier,
but you should be more scared

333
00:20:37,361 --> 00:20:39,029
of enraging all married women
in this country.

334
00:20:39,446 --> 00:20:42,157
With that being said, we would like you

335
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:45,118
to move out of our building
as soon as possible.

336
00:20:46,703 --> 00:20:48,288
All right, ladies.
Let's go to Unit 804 now.

337
00:20:48,372 --> 00:20:49,206
Yes.

338
00:20:49,414 --> 00:20:51,250
Their dogs have been causing problems.

339
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:54,503
They have eight dogs that bark constantly.

340
00:20:55,212 --> 00:20:56,421
We'll get going then.

341
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:04,054
Your head must be really splitting now.

342
00:21:04,638 --> 00:21:05,973
Shall I pick up some medicine for you?

343
00:21:52,728 --> 00:21:54,438
MISSED CALL, A-JIN WOO

344
00:22:06,408 --> 00:22:07,993
-Is this where she is?
-Yes.

345
00:22:08,285 --> 00:22:10,203
The location of her phone
showed up at this hotel.

346
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:11,663
She must be in a suite.

347
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:14,458
That's my guess
from a psychological perspective.

348
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:18,086
There are security cameras
in every hallway. We can't drag her out.

349
00:22:20,088 --> 00:22:21,465
What's your plan?

350
00:22:22,591 --> 00:22:25,052
We should lure her out of the room.

351
00:22:31,308 --> 00:22:32,517
Give this to the front desk.

352
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:35,312
Tell them to give it to Ms. Ji-yeong Park
in one of their suites.

353
00:22:39,691 --> 00:22:40,650
I saw this coming.

354
00:22:42,903 --> 00:22:44,571
What did I tell you?

355
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:47,949
I told you

356
00:22:49,326 --> 00:22:51,244
that she needs to leave.

357
00:22:52,329 --> 00:22:54,247
Why didn't you listen to me?

358
00:23:00,921 --> 00:23:01,922
Father.

359
00:23:04,007 --> 00:23:06,343
I'm not your daughter-in-law anymore.

360
00:23:19,397 --> 00:23:20,607
Mr. Kang, I have a question.

361
00:23:21,399 --> 00:23:24,986
I wasn't going to say anything about this
as it's just my speculation,

362
00:23:25,445 --> 00:23:26,905
but about Ms. Woo's case...

363
00:23:28,323 --> 00:23:31,660
Lawsuits for divorce,
division of property, and child custody

364
00:23:31,868 --> 00:23:33,745
are usually done together
in most cases like hers.

365
00:23:34,371 --> 00:23:35,956
Shouldn't we have done that?

366
00:23:36,915 --> 00:23:40,544
Why were you in such a rush
to get her divorced?

367
00:23:40,752 --> 00:23:43,672
Gosh, what are you talking about?
Don't be silly.

368
00:23:44,589 --> 00:23:47,300
You seemed to be in a rush
to make her a divorcée.

369
00:23:47,717 --> 00:23:49,219
It was intentional, wasn't it?

370
00:23:49,302 --> 00:23:51,847
-No. What are you thinking?
-Don't deny it.

371
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:54,641
I just thought combining them together
would slow things down.

372
00:23:54,724 --> 00:23:58,019
Exactly. Didn't you rush it
so that you can stop feeling anxious?

373
00:24:00,689 --> 00:24:01,648
No, not at all.

374
00:24:06,653 --> 00:24:09,030
Right, that was expected.

375
00:24:10,448 --> 00:24:14,619
By the way, Mr. Han, I think
I need to hire a personal bodyguard.

376
00:24:14,786 --> 00:24:16,955
Could you send me somebody you can trust?

377
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:22,878
Also, don't try any tricks with me.

378
00:24:24,087 --> 00:24:25,922
You know we're in the same boat.

379
00:24:27,883 --> 00:24:28,758
Yes, all right.

380
00:24:49,112 --> 00:24:50,030
Hello?

381
00:24:56,286 --> 00:24:57,829
We should go see Dad at the hospital.

382
00:24:57,913 --> 00:24:59,456
Go by yourself.

383
00:24:59,706 --> 00:25:03,001
I'll meet that man, Mr. Han

384
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:05,378
and try to find a way
to get the company back.

385
00:25:05,587 --> 00:25:07,964
How on earth are we going to get it back?

386
00:25:08,215 --> 00:25:10,008
Are you saying
we should just let them take it?

387
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:11,718
I can't do that.

388
00:25:13,094 --> 00:25:15,472
I wish I could turn back
the hands of time.

389
00:25:16,681 --> 00:25:17,682
Where are you going?

390
00:25:18,475 --> 00:25:21,811
If we want to catch a tiger,
we must go into its den.

391
00:25:22,479 --> 00:25:24,314
Digging a rabbit hole
won't help us in any way.

392
00:25:39,162 --> 00:25:41,957
I'll wait for you 50m diagonally away
from the hotel's main entrance.

393
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:44,668
See you at 9 p.m..

394
00:25:52,342 --> 00:25:54,386
A-jin Woo

395
00:26:01,434 --> 00:26:02,602
What brings you here?

396
00:26:02,727 --> 00:26:03,687
What do you think?

397
00:26:04,729 --> 00:26:06,147
I came to make sure you eat something.

398
00:26:06,231 --> 00:26:07,065
You're hungry, right?

399
00:26:08,024 --> 00:26:09,901
How did you know that I'd be hungry?

400
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:11,903
Because I'm hungry.

401
00:26:14,155 --> 00:26:15,240
That's how we are.

402
00:26:15,365 --> 00:26:17,867
You're hungry when I'm hungry.

403
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:22,455
He's still unconscious.

404
00:26:23,915 --> 00:26:27,294
By the way, how come
his children aren't here?

405
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:45,770
-Dad...
-Couldn't you have come sooner?

406
00:26:45,854 --> 00:26:48,565
I've been so out of it
because I just got divorced.

407
00:26:48,982 --> 00:26:50,734
Didn't I get divorced too?

408
00:26:56,197 --> 00:26:57,282
Why are you here?

409
00:26:57,699 --> 00:26:59,659
I'm leaving. Let's go.

410
00:26:59,743 --> 00:27:02,120
-Let's eat this outside.
-Where are you going?

411
00:27:02,329 --> 00:27:04,164
You can't leave. Who will look after Dad?

412
00:27:04,247 --> 00:27:05,332
Are you drunk?

413
00:27:05,582 --> 00:27:08,251
I mean, have you been drinking
in broad daylight, Mr. Jae-seok Ahn?

414
00:27:08,418 --> 00:27:12,255
I really don't need to stay here
and look after your father, Mr. Ahn.

415
00:27:12,339 --> 00:27:13,381
Of course, I should leave.

416
00:27:13,506 --> 00:27:17,344
Besides, he has three children.
How can you guys leave him alone here?

417
00:27:17,427 --> 00:27:19,054
I can't believe you just showed up.

418
00:27:19,137 --> 00:27:21,306
Don't leave. Stay here with me.

419
00:27:24,934 --> 00:27:26,686
I'm totally distraught, dear.

420
00:27:26,895 --> 00:27:29,647
A-jin, I'm going to break up with her.
Let's...

421
00:27:29,731 --> 00:27:30,815
Bullshit.

422
00:27:31,107 --> 00:27:32,609
What? Bullshit?

423
00:27:32,984 --> 00:27:35,695
Your father is bedridden.
Let's not do this in front of him.

424
00:27:39,282 --> 00:27:40,909
Where are you two going together?

425
00:27:42,202 --> 00:27:44,704
By any chance,
are you two seeing each other?

426
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:47,624
They say, you only see what you know.

427
00:27:52,921 --> 00:27:56,466
Why do they look so close though?
It pisses me off.

428
00:28:03,098 --> 00:28:05,141
-Where are you heading now?
-I should go home.

429
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:08,186
Take this.
You should eat it at home with Ji-hu.

430
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:10,522
Thanks, partner.

431
00:28:33,795 --> 00:28:35,630
-Hello.
-How much did you pay for this company?

432
00:28:35,713 --> 00:28:37,799
Do you know what this company
means to us? This is crazy.

433
00:28:37,882 --> 00:28:41,886
I heard that Chairman Ahn didn't want
to pass it down to any of his children.

434
00:28:42,095 --> 00:28:44,139
-What did you say?
-It looks like he wanted to turn

435
00:28:44,222 --> 00:28:47,058
everything he owned into cash
and enjoy his remaining years.

436
00:28:47,308 --> 00:28:49,686
-Well, what I'm saying is...
-Try to think about why he did it.

437
00:28:54,107 --> 00:28:56,359
Do you want to get the company back?

438
00:29:16,212 --> 00:29:17,964
Did you give the note to Ms. Park?

439
00:29:18,131 --> 00:29:20,508
She left her reply here with me.

440
00:29:31,728 --> 00:29:33,730
Let's make it an hour later, A-jin.

441
00:29:42,864 --> 00:29:43,865
-It's freezing.
-Get in.

442
00:29:45,241 --> 00:29:49,329
That crazy bitch is doing
a long-term stay at Saint Palace.

443
00:29:49,579 --> 00:29:52,332
-I mean, that's all our money.
-Do you want us to just drag her out?

444
00:29:52,582 --> 00:29:53,416
Hey.

445
00:29:53,917 --> 00:29:55,835
Do you guys have nothing better to wear?

446
00:29:56,711 --> 00:30:00,173
You guys won't even get a key
if you ask for a room dressed like that.

447
00:30:01,508 --> 00:30:03,384
We can do anything if you pay us.

448
00:30:04,427 --> 00:30:05,345
That's true.

449
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:29,118
-Is it good?
-Yes, it's delicious.

450
00:30:29,953 --> 00:30:31,079
-Ji-hu.
-Yes?

451
00:30:32,205 --> 00:30:33,498
No, never mind.

452
00:30:33,998 --> 00:30:35,375
Let's just eat this today.

453
00:30:35,708 --> 00:30:37,544
Tomorrow will be another day, right?

454
00:30:38,253 --> 00:30:41,631
You're implying that you're not happy
with how things are today.

455
00:30:42,841 --> 00:30:43,967
Right, I'm a little unhappy.

456
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:45,635
The sun is the same every day.

457
00:30:45,718 --> 00:30:48,221
We just can't see it from time to time
because of the clouds.

458
00:30:51,683 --> 00:30:53,434
Mom, cheer up.

459
00:30:55,562 --> 00:30:56,437
Ji-hu.

460
00:30:57,063 --> 00:30:58,398
I hope you don't hate Dad.

461
00:30:58,648 --> 00:31:00,233
I hope you don't hate him.

462
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:02,694
I can't help it.

463
00:31:02,819 --> 00:31:03,820
It's understandable.

464
00:31:04,237 --> 00:31:05,196
I'm sorry.

465
00:31:05,613 --> 00:31:07,949
I feel bad that I'm telling you
things like this when I'm your mom.

466
00:31:08,116 --> 00:31:10,493
Becoming a parent

467
00:31:10,702 --> 00:31:13,496
doesn't mean you become God.

468
00:31:14,122 --> 00:31:16,916
You're the best, Mom.
I give you 100 out of 100.

469
00:31:17,792 --> 00:31:18,960
I don't deserve that.

470
00:31:19,085 --> 00:31:21,296
I even get Aunt Jin-hee to pick you up.

471
00:31:21,504 --> 00:31:23,381
I'm pretty generous.

472
00:31:23,464 --> 00:31:25,133
Yes, I know that.

473
00:31:30,305 --> 00:31:31,180
Ji-hu.

474
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:34,767
Grandpa collapsed.

475
00:31:34,934 --> 00:31:37,145
Really? What should we do?

476
00:31:37,395 --> 00:31:39,188
Pray for him to regain
his consciousness soon.

477
00:31:39,606 --> 00:31:41,649
You said you can talk to God.

478
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:43,318
Okay, I'll definitely pray for him.

479
00:31:44,277 --> 00:31:47,405
But I don't really think
God listens to me these days.

480
00:31:48,323 --> 00:31:50,867
I prayed that things between you and Dad
would get better.

481
00:31:51,618 --> 00:31:53,328
God must have been busy.

482
00:31:53,494 --> 00:31:54,913
You should pester him more.

483
00:31:55,246 --> 00:31:56,706
All right, I will.

484
00:31:57,957 --> 00:32:00,209
I really hope Grandpa is okay.

485
00:32:03,087 --> 00:32:04,756
I know that we're used to

486
00:32:05,465 --> 00:32:09,177
living in a big house
and going on a trip abroad every year,

487
00:32:09,302 --> 00:32:11,137
but we may not be able
to live like that anymore.

488
00:32:14,349 --> 00:32:15,642
It's also possible

489
00:32:16,476 --> 00:32:17,518
that I may no longer

490
00:32:17,685 --> 00:32:19,771
be able to have Aunt Jin-hee
pick you up and give you rides.

491
00:32:20,063 --> 00:32:21,314
That's totally fine.

492
00:32:21,439 --> 00:32:23,608
My baby, you're such a strong girl.

493
00:32:24,359 --> 00:32:26,069
Finish this quickly and go to bed early.

494
00:32:26,235 --> 00:32:27,737
I have to step out after you fall asleep.

495
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:30,531
-To the war zone?
-That's right, the war zone.

496
00:32:41,459 --> 00:32:42,293
Hello?

497
00:32:44,295 --> 00:32:45,296
What's the matter?

498
00:32:45,922 --> 00:32:46,923
Yes, so what?

499
00:32:49,384 --> 00:32:50,718
Let's talk at home.

500
00:32:52,095 --> 00:32:53,388
Stop calling me. I have to go.

501
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:09,946
What? He wants to end it?
He wants to break up with me?

502
00:33:12,031 --> 00:33:15,034
I'm the one who should be saying that.
How dare he beat me to it?

503
00:33:32,969 --> 00:33:35,346
Seong-hui, I got it open.

504
00:33:51,988 --> 00:33:55,074
Today I went to play with Jin-hee...

505
00:33:55,158 --> 00:33:58,327
I learned Volleyball for the first time...

506
00:34:21,225 --> 00:34:22,143
What should we do?

507
00:34:23,603 --> 00:34:24,437
Yes.

508
00:34:25,813 --> 00:34:26,898
Okay, got it.

509
00:34:27,356 --> 00:34:28,775
What did he say?

510
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:31,152
He told me to go up to the 19th floor
through the emergency exit.

511
00:34:31,235 --> 00:34:32,111
Why?

512
00:34:32,945 --> 00:34:35,615
He said she's in one of the suites there.

513
00:34:35,698 --> 00:34:37,325
Then, why did we get off on this floor?

514
00:34:37,408 --> 00:34:38,910
Because of the security cameras,
you idiot.

515
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:40,703
Keep your voice down.

516
00:34:59,347 --> 00:35:02,391
I'll wait for you 50m diagonally away
from the hotel's main entrance.

517
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,268
See you at 9 p.m. A-jin Woo.

518
00:35:04,393 --> 00:35:06,479
Let's make it an hour later, A-jin.

519
00:35:35,216 --> 00:35:36,342
What should we do?

520
00:35:36,759 --> 00:35:40,805
It doesn't look like things will go
according to your plan, Ms. A-jin Woo.

521
00:35:43,975 --> 00:35:45,476
Room service.

522
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:13,880
Gosh, wait. Just a moment.

523
00:36:13,963 --> 00:36:15,131
Who are you guys?

524
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:21,888
Just follow us quietly.
Then, we won't hurt you.

525
00:36:22,221 --> 00:36:24,223
Wait, just give me a second.

526
00:36:25,391 --> 00:36:27,560
All right, I heard you guys.

527
00:36:27,935 --> 00:36:31,105
Please just let me finish the wine
before I go with you guys, okay?

528
00:36:33,399 --> 00:36:35,860
I will follow you guys. By the way,

529
00:36:36,277 --> 00:36:38,571
you've never slept in a hotel suite,
have you?

530
00:36:39,071 --> 00:36:42,158
When you come to a place like this,
you need to drink expensive alcohol

531
00:36:42,575 --> 00:36:44,327
and take pictures.

532
00:36:44,410 --> 00:36:45,786
Don't you dare try to trick us.

533
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:51,334
Just let me have one more glass
before we go.

534
00:37:11,229 --> 00:37:12,355
Gosh, what is going on?

535
00:37:21,656 --> 00:37:22,615
Who are you?

536
00:37:28,454 --> 00:37:29,372
Ms. A-jin Woo?

537
00:37:33,501 --> 00:37:36,879
I know A-jin's handwriting very well.

538
00:37:38,923 --> 00:37:41,092
Aren't you a professor?

539
00:37:41,634 --> 00:37:43,719
How can you be so inept and shortsighted?

540
00:37:49,392 --> 00:37:50,559
Bok-ja Park.

541
00:37:51,227 --> 00:37:53,562
I mean, Ms. Ji-yeong Park.
You said you met her for the first time

542
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:55,856
when you interviewed her
for the caregiver position,

543
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:59,777
but we did some digging and found out
that the two of you go way back.

544
00:38:00,236 --> 00:38:02,738
You met her for the first time

545
00:38:02,822 --> 00:38:05,658
at the hotel where she stayed long-term

546
00:38:06,367 --> 00:38:07,702
after she disappeared with the money

547
00:38:08,703 --> 00:38:10,329
from selling the company.

548
00:38:12,873 --> 00:38:15,251
You don't remember, Ms. Woo?

549
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:35,271
Hello?

550
00:38:37,565 --> 00:38:38,441
Yes.

551
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:45,406
Thanks for everything.

552
00:38:46,907 --> 00:38:49,869
Please wrap it up well,
and I'll see you soon.

553
00:38:52,204 --> 00:38:53,205
All right.

554
00:38:54,290 --> 00:38:55,124
Bye.

555
00:39:29,033 --> 00:39:30,743
-What are you two doing here now?
-Gosh!

556
00:39:34,163 --> 00:39:35,664
-Let's talk.
-Go ahead.

557
00:39:35,748 --> 00:39:38,000
I'll leave your husband.

558
00:39:38,084 --> 00:39:39,877
Do it. It's none of my business though.

559
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:42,546
So, give me back my paintings.

560
00:39:44,507 --> 00:39:46,217
You said you'd keep them
because I took him.

561
00:39:46,592 --> 00:39:48,260
I'll give your husband back to you,

562
00:39:48,594 --> 00:39:50,721
so give me back my paintings.

563
00:39:51,347 --> 00:39:52,515
Ms. Seong-hui Yun.

564
00:39:53,557 --> 00:39:57,311
How will you succeed as an artist
when you're this clueless?

565
00:39:57,561 --> 00:39:58,396
What?

566
00:40:01,357 --> 00:40:04,318
When you and my husband
started having an affair,

567
00:40:04,485 --> 00:40:06,737
his value skyrocketed.

568
00:40:06,821 --> 00:40:10,157
Simply put, his price
was the highest back then,

569
00:40:10,241 --> 00:40:12,660
but his value has plummeted
since that time.

570
00:40:13,327 --> 00:40:15,496
The problem is that
our transaction was done

571
00:40:15,579 --> 00:40:18,082
when his price was at its highest.

572
00:40:18,249 --> 00:40:19,792
Have you never bought
a real estate property?

573
00:40:20,418 --> 00:40:21,836
Can you annul the contract

574
00:40:21,919 --> 00:40:24,380
just because the value is dropping
after you bought it?

575
00:40:24,505 --> 00:40:25,589
You can't.

576
00:40:25,673 --> 00:40:27,508
What kind of nonsense is that?

577
00:40:27,591 --> 00:40:29,385
A person and a real estate property
aren't the same.

578
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:30,970
Of course, they're different.

579
00:40:31,053 --> 00:40:33,931
How can we compare a person
to a real estate property?

580
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:37,017
I was trying to cater to the level
of your thinking as well as your values

581
00:40:37,143 --> 00:40:40,312
and moral standards
in order to get through to the two of you,

582
00:40:40,479 --> 00:40:42,231
but you still don't seem to get it.

583
00:40:42,857 --> 00:40:45,234
Compensation for emotional distress!

584
00:40:45,734 --> 00:40:46,986
Have you ever heard of it?

585
00:40:47,862 --> 00:40:51,240
My strong self-esteem,
which I had been maintaining so well,

586
00:40:51,824 --> 00:40:54,326
and my castle called a family
were both destroyed by you.

587
00:40:54,493 --> 00:40:58,914
Do you think your paintings are enough
to compensate me for all of that?

588
00:40:59,165 --> 00:41:01,500
If you were to compensate me
for everything you did to me,

589
00:41:01,876 --> 00:41:05,629
you'd have to keep painting nonstop
for the rest of your life.

590
00:41:05,796 --> 00:41:06,672
Do you know that?

591
00:41:08,841 --> 00:41:10,176
I'm speechless.

592
00:41:10,676 --> 00:41:12,636
Now, you're speechless?

593
00:41:13,095 --> 00:41:15,764
I've done nothing to be ashamed of.
I can tell the whole world.

594
00:41:16,307 --> 00:41:19,268
Where's the proof
that your husband and I had an affair?

595
00:41:19,977 --> 00:41:22,188
I know that you're planning
to sell my paintings

596
00:41:22,396 --> 00:41:24,732
when the prices jump
after I become famous.

597
00:41:25,357 --> 00:41:27,067
I'll tell all media outlets

598
00:41:27,443 --> 00:41:29,111
that you stole them from me.

599
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:33,199
Look, Ms. Seong-hui Yun.

600
00:41:34,867 --> 00:41:37,995
When a person who is indebted to someone

601
00:41:38,245 --> 00:41:40,623
deliberately changes
ownership of a property

602
00:41:40,706 --> 00:41:43,042
or secretly extracts it,
we call it a fraudulent act.

603
00:41:43,125 --> 00:41:47,338
That's what you did with this house
and that's why I sent you the petition.

604
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:51,675
I'm only keeping your paintings
for the time being

605
00:41:51,759 --> 00:41:53,969
to make sure that you can't commit
other fraudulent acts

606
00:41:54,053 --> 00:41:56,013
prior to my alimony suit.

607
00:41:57,097 --> 00:41:58,474
Are you following?

608
00:41:58,933 --> 00:42:01,310
Also, did you say I stole them?

609
00:42:02,019 --> 00:42:04,355
You're the thief, not me.

610
00:42:04,563 --> 00:42:05,981
You stole my husband from me!

611
00:42:06,774 --> 00:42:08,776
Just live happily ever after
with Jae-seok Ahn

612
00:42:08,901 --> 00:42:11,612
and keep painting.

613
00:42:12,446 --> 00:42:15,407
That's why I let you use the living room
as your studio.

614
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:17,826
I must have done it for a reason,
don't you think?

615
00:42:19,286 --> 00:42:21,830
Look, Ms. Woo. You're out of line.

616
00:42:21,956 --> 00:42:23,249
You're one to talk.

617
00:42:23,457 --> 00:42:26,085
Also, who told you that you can come here
whenever you want?

618
00:42:26,168 --> 00:42:28,796
This place is a war zone

619
00:42:28,963 --> 00:42:31,632
where your daughter and I
are fiercely fighting against each other.

620
00:42:31,966 --> 00:42:35,177
It's not fair at all to bring an ally
into the game like this.

621
00:42:35,261 --> 00:42:36,095
One more thing.

622
00:42:36,595 --> 00:42:39,890
If you ransack my room like this
once again,

623
00:42:40,182 --> 00:42:42,101
I'll disseminate your daughter's pictures.

624
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:44,353
What do you think you're doing now?

625
00:42:44,770 --> 00:42:47,064
What do you think? I'm threatening you.

626
00:42:47,356 --> 00:42:48,482
Get out immediately!

627
00:42:50,067 --> 00:42:52,528
It's so nice to get together
at night like this.

628
00:42:53,487 --> 00:42:55,823
We can chat as much as we want
without worrying about work.

629
00:42:57,366 --> 00:43:00,035
By the way, did Bok-ja Park really flee?

630
00:43:00,411 --> 00:43:03,664
Don't even get me started.
It's a complete disaster right now.

631
00:43:03,789 --> 00:43:06,750
-They should report her to the police.
-The police can't do anything

632
00:43:07,001 --> 00:43:08,168
because she did nothing wrong.

633
00:43:08,669 --> 00:43:09,920
It's so crazy.

634
00:43:10,004 --> 00:43:12,256
Apparently, Chairman Ahn gave her
all of his shares

635
00:43:12,381 --> 00:43:15,259
and even told her to sell the company.

636
00:43:15,342 --> 00:43:16,176
-What?
-What?

637
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:18,512
It's neither considered fraud
nor embezzlement.

638
00:43:19,263 --> 00:43:21,307
She just sold her shares.

639
00:43:21,557 --> 00:43:23,726
Why did he trust her so much?

640
00:43:24,393 --> 00:43:27,605
He was totally bewitched by her.

641
00:43:27,688 --> 00:43:29,023
That's what I'm saying.

642
00:43:30,024 --> 00:43:31,609
By the way, why isn't Yeo-ul here yet?

643
00:43:31,942 --> 00:43:33,277
She got fired.

644
00:43:33,736 --> 00:43:34,737
What do you mean?

645
00:43:35,362 --> 00:43:36,488
Well, what happened was...

646
00:43:37,323 --> 00:43:39,366
Two days ago, the chairman's wife
wanted to speak with her.

647
00:43:39,450 --> 00:43:42,911
Then, she asked out of the blue,
"What have you been saying to people?

648
00:43:44,788 --> 00:43:45,623
Goodness.

649
00:43:45,706 --> 00:43:47,333
How does the wife
of Wansan Trade's president

650
00:43:47,416 --> 00:43:49,835
know about my son being investigated
by the prosecution?

651
00:43:50,044 --> 00:43:51,295
It's Pung-suk's Kitchen, isn't it?"

652
00:43:52,296 --> 00:43:55,090
Come to think of it,
Pung-suk has been acting

653
00:43:55,382 --> 00:43:57,968
a bit suspiciously for some time now.

654
00:43:58,052 --> 00:44:00,846
Did you just notice that now?
You should watch what you say to her.

655
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:04,642
She's a lot closer
with those rich ladies than we are.

656
00:44:05,559 --> 00:44:06,810
My gosh.

657
00:44:06,977 --> 00:44:09,647
Then, where can we go to vent from now on?

658
00:44:10,189 --> 00:44:12,316
But we usually gossip
when she's not around.

659
00:44:12,941 --> 00:44:14,610
How does she even know?

660
00:44:17,321 --> 00:44:20,407
What if she planted a bug somewhere?

661
00:44:24,953 --> 00:44:27,831
By the way, have you ladies heard
about what's going on at Mr. Kim's place?

662
00:44:37,549 --> 00:44:39,093
Bong-sik, what happened?

663
00:44:40,928 --> 00:44:42,638
You didn't beat him up, did you?

664
00:44:43,430 --> 00:44:44,390
Mun-tak.

665
00:44:46,392 --> 00:44:47,351
It's so...

666
00:44:49,061 --> 00:44:50,062
It's ridiculous.

667
00:44:50,396 --> 00:44:53,232
-What do you mean?
-I went there to beat him up to death.

668
00:44:53,649 --> 00:44:56,652
I mean, I thought he deserved to get
what was done to me.

669
00:44:56,944 --> 00:44:59,113
-Then, what happened?
-But...

670
00:45:00,406 --> 00:45:01,782
-Bye!
-Bye. See you all tomorrow.

671
00:45:01,865 --> 00:45:03,492
-See you.
-All right. Get home safely.

672
00:45:04,368 --> 00:45:05,536
-Hello.
-Nonhyeon-dong, please.

673
00:45:05,619 --> 00:45:07,371
-Sure, no problem.
-Here you go.

674
00:45:15,295 --> 00:45:16,630
-Honey...
-Don't do this, Mr. Kim.

675
00:45:17,423 --> 00:45:18,674
This won't resolve anything.

676
00:45:19,591 --> 00:45:20,551
-Move!
-It wasn't me!

677
00:45:20,634 --> 00:45:22,553
You deserve this, you prick.
I'll break your ribs...

678
00:45:22,636 --> 00:45:23,971
I'm not the one who beat you up!

679
00:45:24,054 --> 00:45:26,306
This is what you get
for sleeping with my wife!

680
00:46:06,054 --> 00:46:07,181
Let's end it now.

681
00:46:08,515 --> 00:46:10,142
I'm fine with us ending it,

682
00:46:11,810 --> 00:46:13,061
but when I think about your wife,

683
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:15,731
I feel so bad.

684
00:46:18,817 --> 00:46:20,486
Enough feeling that way. Let's stop now.

685
00:46:21,278 --> 00:46:22,154
You should leave.

686
00:46:22,446 --> 00:46:23,864
Let's not see each other anymore.

687
00:46:39,588 --> 00:46:40,714
You're home.

688
00:46:42,424 --> 00:46:44,259
-Have you heard?
-What?

689
00:46:44,635 --> 00:46:47,763
Dr. Jang's wife is injured.
She's at a hospital now.

690
00:46:48,597 --> 00:46:51,642
What did you just say?
Gosh. Which hospital?

691
00:46:54,895 --> 00:46:55,854
Dad, goodness.

692
00:46:56,271 --> 00:46:57,898
I knew that something like this
would happen.

693
00:46:58,232 --> 00:47:00,317
Dad, why on earth did you do that?

694
00:47:01,902 --> 00:47:04,863
Why were you so bewitched by her?
Why did you even trust that woman?

695
00:47:05,197 --> 00:47:06,907
You definitely deserve all this.

696
00:47:07,783 --> 00:47:08,742
Gosh.

697
00:47:13,247 --> 00:47:14,081
Dad.

698
00:47:16,041 --> 00:47:17,125
I...

699
00:47:18,794 --> 00:47:19,962
I got divorced.

700
00:47:22,005 --> 00:47:23,173
What should I do now?

701
00:47:29,888 --> 00:47:32,057
Do you want to get the company back?

702
00:47:35,936 --> 00:47:38,397
Why didn't you pick up? I was so worried.

703
00:47:44,111 --> 00:47:44,987
That bitch...

704
00:47:47,197 --> 00:47:48,824
I'll really kill her.

705
00:47:49,324 --> 00:47:50,200
Did you find her?

706
00:47:50,742 --> 00:47:52,286
Did you figure out
where that woman is now?

707
00:47:53,078 --> 00:47:55,080
Ma'am, we've arrived at your place.

708
00:47:58,959 --> 00:48:00,752
What would you like me to do
with those two guys?

709
00:48:01,086 --> 00:48:03,005
Who are you?

710
00:48:04,506 --> 00:48:06,133
I'm Ms. Ji-yeong Park's bodyguard.

711
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:08,093
What happened to him?

712
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:09,094
Who?

713
00:48:10,429 --> 00:48:11,471
Mr. Bong-cheol Gu?

714
00:48:12,806 --> 00:48:14,600
He got beaten up to a pulp.
He's at a hospital now.

715
00:48:15,601 --> 00:48:19,271
These two aren't in the system
and their nationality is unknown,

716
00:48:19,771 --> 00:48:21,315
so they can't be admitted
to any hospitals.

717
00:48:22,816 --> 00:48:24,318
It looks like you have to look after them.

718
00:48:24,610 --> 00:48:27,446
Who are these guys?

719
00:48:27,613 --> 00:48:28,989
Mr. Jae-gu Ahn will know.

720
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:31,116
I should go.

721
00:48:36,246 --> 00:48:38,624
-It's just so strange.
-What's strange?

722
00:48:38,707 --> 00:48:39,583
The person

723
00:48:41,209 --> 00:48:43,920
who told me that bitch is there

724
00:48:44,671 --> 00:48:45,672
was Mr. Oh.

725
00:48:46,798 --> 00:48:48,508
-Mr. Oh?
-But

726
00:48:49,426 --> 00:48:50,260
that bitch

727
00:48:53,055 --> 00:48:54,640
knew that I was coming.

728
00:48:55,015 --> 00:48:55,891
What does that mean?

729
00:48:56,475 --> 00:48:58,518
Do you think that Mr. Oh
is on that woman's side?

730
00:49:08,779 --> 00:49:12,699
-Hey.
-I told you not to do anything!

731
00:49:18,413 --> 00:49:20,082
Please continue to help me out.

732
00:49:22,918 --> 00:49:24,211
Of course.

733
00:49:24,503 --> 00:49:26,380
And please keep a watchful eye on Mr. Han.

734
00:49:26,546 --> 00:49:27,547
Please don't worry.

735
00:49:28,548 --> 00:49:31,927
But I don't feel good
about telling Mr. Jae-gu Ahn

736
00:49:32,302 --> 00:49:33,679
where you are.

737
00:49:34,221 --> 00:49:37,140
I did it because you asked me to,
but he may come again.

738
00:49:37,265 --> 00:49:39,184
That guy doesn't scare me at all.

739
00:49:39,685 --> 00:49:41,645
You should be careful though.

740
00:49:42,354 --> 00:49:44,856
He'll be suspicious of you
unless he's a total idiot.

741
00:49:45,857 --> 00:49:48,860
If he confronts you and talks shit,
just tell him

742
00:49:49,486 --> 00:49:51,655
that you're being paid
to follow my orders.

743
00:49:54,074 --> 00:49:55,450
I was just kidding.

744
00:49:59,454 --> 00:50:02,582
Jae-gu Ahn, Jae-hui Ahn and Jae-seok Ahn.

745
00:50:03,250 --> 00:50:05,252
All of them are nothing,
but complete morons.

746
00:50:07,963 --> 00:50:09,715
I feel bad for Chairman Ahn.

747
00:50:10,090 --> 00:50:12,050
-I should get going.
-Wait.

748
00:50:14,636 --> 00:50:16,471
Has he still not regained
his consciousness?

749
00:50:16,888 --> 00:50:17,764
Yes.

750
00:50:18,306 --> 00:50:19,975
Who's staying at the hospital?

751
00:50:20,225 --> 00:50:22,227
Ms. Woo was there.

752
00:50:24,980 --> 00:50:26,022
That woman

753
00:50:27,149 --> 00:50:28,817
is very cool, isn't she?

754
00:50:29,568 --> 00:50:30,402
Pardon?

755
00:50:32,070 --> 00:50:32,988
Never mind.

756
00:50:33,905 --> 00:50:34,906
You should get going.

757
00:51:07,856 --> 00:51:09,608
Is this why you lent me money
without any condition

758
00:51:09,691 --> 00:51:11,151
when I was opening my shop?

759
00:51:11,276 --> 00:51:12,652
Do you think that makes sense?

760
00:51:13,195 --> 00:51:15,864
I wouldn't have done that
if I had known this would happen.

761
00:51:16,448 --> 00:51:18,909
The end result of this will be amazing.
Wait for it.

762
00:51:26,917 --> 00:51:27,876
I'm sorry.

763
00:52:40,323 --> 00:52:41,199
Come out.

764
00:52:46,162 --> 00:52:47,664
Where are we going now?

765
00:52:48,123 --> 00:52:49,541
You want to kill that bitch, don't you?

766
00:52:50,834 --> 00:52:52,878
-Does this mean that you trust me?
-No.

767
00:52:53,545 --> 00:52:55,297
I'll trust you if you kill that bitch.

768
00:53:02,762 --> 00:53:04,055
Do you really not remember?

769
00:53:05,015 --> 00:53:07,976
The suite at Saint Palace Hotel.

770
00:53:11,813 --> 00:53:13,607
I do remember now.

771
00:54:16,836 --> 00:54:19,047
I'm scared. Come home now.

772
00:54:19,798 --> 00:54:21,549
I hate thunderstorms.

773
00:54:21,758 --> 00:54:25,387
A-jin must be there.
Why are you scared? You're not even alone.

774
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:28,848
My dad collapsed
and he's still unconscious.

775
00:54:32,394 --> 00:54:34,938
Wait, is A-jin not home now?

776
00:54:35,188 --> 00:54:37,649
No, she's not here. She went out.

777
00:54:37,816 --> 00:54:39,484
Where on earth did she go this late?

778
00:54:40,193 --> 00:54:41,736
How do I know?

779
00:54:58,920 --> 00:54:59,921
No, no way.

780
00:55:00,797 --> 00:55:02,132
What if they're seeing each other?

781
00:55:02,590 --> 00:55:05,093
No, there's no way.
A-jin wouldn't do that.

782
00:55:05,593 --> 00:55:08,888
Actually, you never know what can happen
between a man and a woman.

783
00:55:10,473 --> 00:55:12,058
What was that asshole's number?

784
00:55:12,642 --> 00:55:15,186
LAWYER GI-HO KANG

785
00:55:18,606 --> 00:55:19,482
Hello?

786
00:55:25,155 --> 00:55:28,116
QUEEN BEE

787
00:55:34,998 --> 00:55:36,666
Why isn't she picking up?

788
00:55:41,337 --> 00:55:44,090
I'm sorry, Dad.
I have to step out for a bit.

789
00:56:09,783 --> 00:56:12,911
By the way,
was Mr. Tae-dong Ahn unconscious

790
00:56:13,495 --> 00:56:16,331
the whole time
before Ji-yeong Park came back?

791
00:56:38,394 --> 00:56:39,229
Yes.

792
00:56:40,063 --> 00:56:42,232
He didn't regain his consciousness.

793
00:56:42,524 --> 00:56:44,776
TAE-DONG AHN, JAE-GU AHN, JU-MI PARK

794
00:56:47,779 --> 00:56:51,449
JAE-HUI AHN, BANG-SOON CHEON,
BONG-CHEOL GU

795
00:56:51,533 --> 00:56:54,077
MIN-GI HAN, PUNG-SUK OH

796
00:56:57,038 --> 00:56:59,874
The eighth suspect, Pung-suk Oh.

797
00:57:01,251 --> 00:57:03,878
She runs a members-only kitchen
in Dogok-dong, Gangnam, where she makes

798
00:57:03,962 --> 00:57:07,298
and sells various side dishes.
It's called Pung-suk's Kitchen.

799
00:57:07,465 --> 00:57:09,425
It's suspected
that she and Ms. Ji-yeong Park

800
00:57:09,509 --> 00:57:12,262
were hostile toward each other
for some complicated reasons,

801
00:57:12,762 --> 00:57:17,267
and she's also the one who sent
the last text message on Ms. Park's phone.

802
00:57:18,768 --> 00:57:19,727
Father.

803
00:57:22,647 --> 00:57:23,523
Bok-ja.

804
00:57:24,816 --> 00:57:26,818
Where is she now?

805
00:57:57,015 --> 00:57:59,142
I'm not going to wake up.

806
00:57:59,267 --> 00:58:02,729
Let's keep this as a secret between us.

807
00:58:02,937 --> 00:58:05,315
I become weak-willed
when I see a woman I'm attracted to.

808
00:58:05,398 --> 00:58:06,941
You should help us, Mr. Han.

809
00:58:07,025 --> 00:58:10,278
You can use Chairman Ahn's cash
or real estate property as a collateral

810
00:58:10,361 --> 00:58:11,905
and take a loan out from a bank.

811
00:58:11,988 --> 00:58:14,491
Both Father and that bitch...

812
00:58:14,908 --> 00:58:16,743
Tell him to just die!

813
00:58:17,243 --> 00:58:18,870
I didn't know it would come to this.

814
00:58:19,454 --> 00:58:20,705
Please forgive me.

815
00:58:20,955 --> 00:58:21,915
I'm sorry.

816
00:58:23,208 --> 00:58:24,459
Do you have feelings for my wife?

817
00:58:24,542 --> 00:58:27,170
How could a man not have feelings
for a woman like her?

818
00:58:27,253 --> 00:58:29,214
I do like her very much.

819
00:58:29,297 --> 00:58:32,926
Let's break up.
My life has been ruined after I met you.

820
00:58:33,009 --> 00:58:34,802
It's my life that has been ruined.

821
00:58:34,969 --> 00:58:36,054
Did you just hit me?

822
00:58:36,137 --> 00:58:38,765
He decided to give you his shares
with his impaired decision-making ability

823
00:58:38,848 --> 00:58:41,184
-caused by Alzheimer's disease.
-Alzheimer's disease?

824
00:58:42,018 --> 00:58:44,312
The money you took and that diagnosis.

825
00:58:44,395 --> 00:58:45,563
This is the reality.

826
00:58:45,647 --> 00:58:47,649
A fake deserves a fake.

827
00:58:47,982 --> 00:58:50,151
You shouldn't have trusted me.

828
00:58:50,610 --> 00:58:53,112
You shouldn't have fallen for me.

829
00:58:53,196 --> 00:58:55,949
If you do anything stupid,
I'll kill you and go to jail.

830
00:58:56,032 --> 00:58:57,742
-What do you want?
-Money.

831
00:58:57,909 --> 00:58:59,869
-If you wish for things that aren't yours,
-No!

832
00:58:59,953 --> 00:59:01,704
it will only end in destruction.

833
00:59:01,788 --> 00:59:05,041
I went through all that
to get my hands on this.

834
00:59:10,630 --> 00:59:12,215
Mr. Chairman has collapsed!

835
00:59:12,298 --> 00:59:13,341
We have to kill her.

836
00:59:14,759 --> 00:59:16,427
That's the only way.

837
00:59:16,928 --> 00:59:18,096
Give this to the front desk.

838
00:59:18,638 --> 00:59:20,974
Tell them to give it to Ms. Ji-yeong Park
in one of their suites.

839
00:59:21,182 --> 00:59:23,977
I think I need to hire
a personal bodyguard.

840
00:59:24,227 --> 00:59:26,396
Could you send me somebody you can trust?

841
00:59:26,813 --> 00:59:28,356
-Where are you?
-I'm on my way to catch her.

842
00:59:28,856 --> 00:59:30,149
I got the location of her phone.

843
00:59:30,233 --> 00:59:32,026
Dad, why on earth did you do that?

844
00:59:32,110 --> 00:59:34,571
Why were you so bewitched by her?
Why did you even trust that woman?

845
00:59:34,904 --> 00:59:36,155
Gosh.

846
00:59:36,781 --> 00:59:38,032
What should I do now?

847
00:59:39,284 --> 00:59:41,077
Do you want us to just drag her out?

848
00:59:42,412 --> 00:59:43,496
What should we do?

849
00:59:43,830 --> 00:59:47,333
It doesn't look like things will go
according to your plan, Ms. A-jin Woo.

850
00:59:47,417 --> 00:59:48,960
Room service.

851
00:59:52,255 --> 00:59:54,924
Just follow us quietly.
Then, we won't hurt you.

852
01:00:02,557 --> 01:00:03,558
Ms. A-jin Woo?

853
01:00:04,559 --> 01:00:07,770
I know A-jin's handwriting very well.

854
01:00:09,355 --> 01:00:10,273
Father.

855
01:00:10,898 --> 01:00:11,816
Bok-ja...

856
01:00:13,109 --> 01:00:14,944
Where is she now?

857
01:00:16,487 --> 01:00:18,489
