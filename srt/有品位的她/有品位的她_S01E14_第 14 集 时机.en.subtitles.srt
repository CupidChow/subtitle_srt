1
00:01:16,701 --> 00:01:18,787
Well, I hope this is not
a discourteous thing to ask.

2
00:01:19,662 --> 00:01:22,874
Would you let me embellish your shoes
if you trust my taste?

3
00:01:27,879 --> 00:01:29,839
Everything is in your hands now.

4
00:01:30,381 --> 00:01:31,424
Please don't worry.

5
00:01:31,883 --> 00:01:33,176
Just trust me.

6
00:01:35,094 --> 00:01:36,179
Let's get it done.

7
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:43,561
Please sign here
as well as on the last page.

STOCK TRANSFER (ASSIGNMENT) AGREEMENT

9
00:01:52,445 --> 00:01:54,697
ASSIGNEE BOK-JA PARK

10
00:02:18,388 --> 00:02:21,141
It is said that God gives
people three chances.

11
00:02:22,308 --> 00:02:26,187
That chance is often hidden
in small decisions that pass us by

12
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:29,023
or within the process of making a choice.

13
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:44,956
Our lives continue without any hesitation

14
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:49,377
and we encounter hidden
opportunities multiple times a day.

15
00:02:50,044 --> 00:02:53,673
But not everyone is able to recognize it.

16
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:56,467
This is amazing!

17
00:02:57,051 --> 00:02:59,888
The act of making a choice
at the right time

18
00:03:00,346 --> 00:03:02,390
is what we call an opportunity.

19
00:03:11,482 --> 00:03:13,234
Go break her.

20
00:03:13,943 --> 00:03:15,445
We must not let her go any further

21
00:03:16,279 --> 00:03:17,947
or have her way.

22
00:03:19,198 --> 00:03:20,366
Cripple her.

23
00:03:26,247 --> 00:03:29,667
However, as soon as the choice
is made after the right timing,

24
00:03:30,168 --> 00:03:31,336
it becomes a tragedy.

25
00:03:37,926 --> 00:03:38,843
Hello?

26
00:03:40,261 --> 00:03:41,930
Yes.

27
00:03:43,181 --> 00:03:44,015
Yes.

28
00:03:45,141 --> 00:03:46,267
I understand.

29
00:03:46,768 --> 00:03:50,438
In the end, life is all about timing.

30
00:03:50,855 --> 00:03:52,148
-Are you serious?
-Yes.

31
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,192
An official notice was just
posted at the company.

32
00:03:54,442 --> 00:03:56,611
There will be a shareholder
meeting tomorrow afternoon.

33
00:03:57,153 --> 00:03:58,988
Why didn't anyone tell me about that?

34
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:02,200
I told you. Ms. Park told me
to inform you about it.

35
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:05,620
But no one consulted me about this!

36
00:04:05,828 --> 00:04:06,663
Can they do this?

37
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:11,125
I'm sorry to say this,
but I think you've been kicked out.

38
00:04:12,961 --> 00:04:13,795
Kicked out?

39
00:04:13,878 --> 00:04:16,089
It's exactly how it sounds.
I think you've been kicked out.

40
00:04:17,006 --> 00:04:17,924
Kicked to the curb.

41
00:04:21,302 --> 00:04:23,263
You know, I was planning

42
00:04:23,471 --> 00:04:25,848
to work really hard from now on.

43
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:28,810
I know, but everything's about timing.

44
00:04:31,062 --> 00:04:32,188
Geez, seriously!

45
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:34,524
Go, Honey.

46
00:04:35,483 --> 00:04:37,694
-Come home early.
-Okay.

47
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:41,614
I gave Ms. Cheon the menu,
so don't forget to eat.

48
00:04:41,906 --> 00:04:43,032
I'll see you at home tonight.

49
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:45,535
I like it when you speak
using your dialect.

50
00:04:47,537 --> 00:04:49,247
But people are watching.

51
00:04:49,872 --> 00:04:51,666
I should stop using
my dialect from now on.

52
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:53,126
Okay.

53
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:08,057
The gift tax is crazy.

54
00:05:08,474 --> 00:05:10,935
That's why you have to fix your annual
salary to over five billion won.

55
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:13,938
You can use that salary
to pay the gift tax,

56
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:17,900
since you can pay it off
in increments or all at once.

57
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:22,238
But, if you sell your shares
to our funding group before then,

58
00:05:22,613 --> 00:05:25,074
we can give you a deposit that you
can use to pay off the gift tax.

59
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:28,536
Which means that your annual salary
won't matter.

60
00:05:36,252 --> 00:05:37,128
Mr. Han?

61
00:05:38,671 --> 00:05:40,715
I would also like to join

62
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:42,759
the Seven Princesses gathering tomorrow.

63
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:52,018
I said you can't!

64
00:05:52,435 --> 00:05:54,562
You can't set a foot in this room!

65
00:05:54,812 --> 00:05:57,940
I have to work on my paintings.
I'm going to use this room as my studio.

66
00:05:58,816 --> 00:05:59,650
Oh my!

67
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:34,519
Where did you get that bag?

68
00:06:35,269 --> 00:06:37,438
This is another bag I designed myself.

69
00:06:38,022 --> 00:06:40,858
Can you design one for me, as well?

70
00:06:41,609 --> 00:06:44,278
A bag that will suit me perfectly.

71
00:06:44,862 --> 00:06:46,656
Of course! I'd glad to.

72
00:07:47,049 --> 00:07:48,134
It's me, A-jin.

73
00:07:49,093 --> 00:07:52,221
Would you like to have a quick
lunch with me and Gi-ok?

74
00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:55,641
It would be near the gallery
where I work. Is that okay?

75
00:07:56,934 --> 00:07:58,519
The gallery where I held
the bazaar last time.

76
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:10,990
I'm going to get a medical note
and sue that woman.

77
00:08:13,242 --> 00:08:16,454
How much do I have to pay you
to get out of this house? How much?

78
00:08:18,664 --> 00:08:21,042
I'm an artist.

79
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:23,836
I'm at a whole different level than you,
who eats and plays for a living.

80
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:26,464
Time is money. And don't you know

81
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:28,716
the importance of workspace for an artist?

82
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:31,260
How would you know?

83
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:34,305
I can't even count
how many paintings I lost.

84
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:36,724
All the time I wasted...

85
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:42,313
Listen.

86
00:08:43,314 --> 00:08:45,233
I'll give you money,
so please get out of here.

87
00:08:45,733 --> 00:08:47,193
How much can you give me?

88
00:08:47,276 --> 00:08:49,862
I'll consult him about it.

89
00:08:50,446 --> 00:08:51,822
You want this house, right?

90
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:55,409
I'll give you appropriate compensation
for this house, so get out.

91
00:08:55,493 --> 00:08:56,827
Hey, mistress.

92
00:08:58,037 --> 00:09:00,748
I was going to wrap things up
and leave quietly,

93
00:09:01,624 --> 00:09:03,501
but you picked a fight with me first.

94
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:06,087
I just wanted to make that clear.

95
00:09:09,757 --> 00:09:11,926
You just relieved me of my burdens.

96
00:09:13,636 --> 00:09:14,720
Goddamnit.

97
00:09:24,605 --> 00:09:25,565
Mr. Chairman.

98
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:30,361
I have something to tell you.

99
00:09:33,447 --> 00:09:36,701
She used to work with me at a bar.

100
00:09:37,702 --> 00:09:40,371
At the time, she went
by the name of Cho-hui,

101
00:09:40,871 --> 00:09:42,582
and she was very popular.

102
00:09:43,124 --> 00:09:46,544
And regarding her jail time
due to fraud and embezzlement,

103
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:49,297
I'm not sure what kind of stories
you've heard...

104
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:52,466
Is it true she had a daughter
with leukemia?

105
00:09:53,718 --> 00:09:55,928
No, it was all a lie.

106
00:09:58,389 --> 00:09:59,640
Be careful.

107
00:10:00,224 --> 00:10:03,019
As I watched from close proximity,
I didn't think this was right...

108
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:05,938
Don't trust Bok-ja Park too much.

109
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:09,191
I'm sorry I waited
all this time to tell you.

110
00:10:10,568 --> 00:10:12,320
I got it, so you can go.

111
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:18,534
The wrong timing leads to misfortune.

112
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:39,263
Cheers.

113
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:47,688
Then, since you haven't formally announced
it yet, there's no article on it, right?

114
00:10:48,397 --> 00:10:51,108
An article will come out right after
the shareholders meeting tomorrow.

115
00:10:51,442 --> 00:10:53,110
I knew it was too quiet.

116
00:10:54,195 --> 00:10:56,238
Only their second eldest son
knows about this.

117
00:10:56,447 --> 00:10:59,075
But it's not like he can do anything
even if he knows about it.

118
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:02,370
Plus, he probably has no idea

119
00:11:02,453 --> 00:11:04,163
about the share disposal.

120
00:11:17,593 --> 00:11:19,261
Come in. I need to talk to you
about something.

121
00:11:25,601 --> 00:11:26,519
I'm

122
00:11:27,228 --> 00:11:29,188
going to start my second life with you.

123
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:32,024
I was very conflicted
in making this decision.

124
00:11:32,483 --> 00:11:33,859
I'll bet my life on you.

125
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:36,445
So, you have to make a decision, too.

126
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:38,114
Is it me or that woman?

127
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:40,032
Seong-hui.

128
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:43,285
What happened to your face this time?

129
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:46,956
Did A-jin hit you?
Then did you hit her, too?

130
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:48,749
Stop the nonsense and make a decision!

131
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:51,043
This bruise on my face
isn't important right now!

132
00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:55,214
I won't let anyone take you from me.

133
00:11:56,465 --> 00:11:57,299
You're mine.

134
00:11:57,883 --> 00:12:01,220
Yeah. I'm yours, then.

135
00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:04,640
-I gave myself to you.
-Stop with the play on words!

136
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:08,477
But I'm definitely not getting a divorce.

137
00:12:10,146 --> 00:12:12,523
-What?
-Should I be honest? The thing is,

138
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:16,652
I think about you at night,
and I think about A-jin during the day.

139
00:12:17,111 --> 00:12:17,987
What is this?

140
00:12:19,113 --> 00:12:20,948
Then are you saying you
love me in a physical way

141
00:12:21,699 --> 00:12:23,742
while you love that woman
in a mental way, or what?

142
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,578
No, that's not it, either.

143
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:29,582
In other words, A-jin is my sun
and you're my moon.

144
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:30,875
That's what it is.

145
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:32,001
You better...

146
00:12:33,377 --> 00:12:34,628
get rid of that sun.

147
00:12:35,796 --> 00:12:36,922
You're all mine.

148
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:40,050
Seong-hui, I'm really tired today.

149
00:12:41,552 --> 00:12:43,179
Father gave all of my stocks

150
00:12:43,387 --> 00:12:45,347
to that woman he married.

151
00:12:47,057 --> 00:12:49,101
What? What did you say?

152
00:12:49,518 --> 00:12:52,229
My head hurts. I think it's time
to depend on medicine.

153
00:12:52,313 --> 00:12:54,273
Wait, what did you just say?

154
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:57,860
Are you saying the company has been
passed over to your stepmother?

155
00:12:59,361 --> 00:13:01,947
-I think so.
-Hey, you idiot!

156
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:04,492
What have you been doing all this time?

157
00:13:04,658 --> 00:13:07,495
What else? I loved you!

158
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:11,457
In other words, I exchanged
the company for you.

159
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:13,417
Jeez! You idiot!

160
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:16,003
Hey, you idiot! What the heck?

161
00:13:16,253 --> 00:13:19,840
I've completely won over the reporters.

162
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:21,717
You even won over the reporters?

163
00:13:22,343 --> 00:13:24,470
Gosh, of course, Mr. Han.

164
00:13:25,262 --> 00:13:28,933
Our world is more emotional
than you would expect.

165
00:13:29,725 --> 00:13:31,769
You don't necessarily have to spend

166
00:13:31,894 --> 00:13:35,648
a lot of money to move someone's heart.

167
00:13:36,106 --> 00:13:36,982
I knew it.

168
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:40,945
I fully sensed that kind of aura
around you, Ms. Park.

169
00:13:42,905 --> 00:13:45,449
I'll make my next move
as quietly as possible.

170
00:13:45,783 --> 00:13:47,243
Then, I'll get things ready

171
00:13:47,618 --> 00:13:49,954
for the next step as quietly as possible.

172
00:13:50,371 --> 00:13:51,372
Quietly.

173
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:03,926
I had a daughter.

174
00:14:05,553 --> 00:14:07,555
But seven years ago,

175
00:14:08,806 --> 00:14:10,349
she developed leukemia.

176
00:14:10,933 --> 00:14:14,812
So, I ended up in prison.

177
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:19,441
I was there to hurt Ms. Bok-ja Park,
who is your wife now.

178
00:14:20,609 --> 00:14:22,152
I mean, this lady here

179
00:14:23,654 --> 00:14:26,282
visited me at the gym and gave me
an envelope with cash inside.

180
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:28,117
He's putting on a show, Father.

181
00:14:29,118 --> 00:14:31,287
I bet he's colluding with this woman.

182
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:33,080
She's the mastermind behind it.

183
00:14:33,163 --> 00:14:36,041
Shut up! How dare you spew such nonsense?

184
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:39,962
Honey. I'm okay,

185
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:42,381
so let's not make a fuss about this.

186
00:14:43,007 --> 00:14:45,092
Don't trust Bok-ja Park too much.

187
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:47,177
After all this time...

188
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:22,838
Ma'am, I'm going to the police station
to charge you with assault.

189
00:15:25,716 --> 00:15:27,885
I'll join you in making that charge!

190
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:31,096
This is nonsense! I never hit you!

191
00:15:31,472 --> 00:15:33,349
I definitely got hit.

192
00:15:33,849 --> 00:15:36,393
I'm hurting everywhere
including my back and bottom.

193
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:39,521
If I get it diagnosed, I'll have to be
hospitalized for 50 weeks!

194
00:15:43,734 --> 00:15:45,319
What the heck is this lady?

195
00:15:54,161 --> 00:15:56,330
-You knew, didn't you?
-About what?

196
00:15:58,165 --> 00:16:00,292
About Dr. Jang and Gyeong-hui
seeing each other.

197
00:16:02,586 --> 00:16:05,506
You knew. I can tell
by the look on your face.

198
00:16:06,215 --> 00:16:08,717
How did you find out about that?

199
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:13,138
This is no ordinary matter.

200
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:15,557
A death could result from it.

201
00:16:15,724 --> 00:16:17,559
Bong-sik found out.

202
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:23,649
Dr. Jang ordered someone to beat up
Bong-sik in that parking lot, didn't he?

203
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:27,403
No, he said he didn't.

204
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:28,654
Who said he didn't do it?

205
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:32,199
Dr. Jang told Gi-ok

206
00:16:32,533 --> 00:16:34,201
that it really wasn't him.

207
00:16:35,452 --> 00:16:37,496
Of course, he said that.
Why would he admit to it?

208
00:16:38,706 --> 00:16:41,166
There isn't a single proper person
in that group.

209
00:16:43,544 --> 00:16:45,129
This is no ordinary matter.

210
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:47,798
Bong-sik won't let Dr. Jang
get away with this.

211
00:16:48,716 --> 00:16:51,927
He even got her pregnant.
This can't get any worse!

212
00:16:57,766 --> 00:16:58,851
Have you been well?

213
00:16:59,393 --> 00:17:01,645
-You know how it is.
-I heard you're sending Do-hyeon abroad.

214
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:04,189
-To Sherman School?
-Yeah, he's going next month.

215
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:06,859
You must have a lot on your mind.

216
00:17:07,943 --> 00:17:08,986
You know how it is.

217
00:17:09,903 --> 00:17:11,947
Gi-ok said she's going to be
around ten minutes late.

218
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:13,198
Yeah, I heard.

219
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:16,118
You must be having
a tough time these days.

220
00:17:16,785 --> 00:17:17,745
You know how it is.

221
00:17:18,954 --> 00:17:22,458
The rumor about my husband dumping me
has spread all over Gangnam, hasn't it?

222
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:26,045
What? That's nonsense.
How were you dumped?

223
00:17:26,128 --> 00:17:29,298
If you were dumped, I was
dumped as soon as I got married.

224
00:17:30,841 --> 00:17:33,135
Gosh, men are so cheap.

225
00:17:35,596 --> 00:17:38,223
Hyo-ju, can you help me with something?

226
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:41,643
I was wondering

227
00:17:42,144 --> 00:17:44,813
if I can use your blog. Can I do that?

228
00:17:45,147 --> 00:17:47,149
Anytime.

229
00:17:47,441 --> 00:17:49,651
I'll do anything I can do to help.

230
00:17:49,985 --> 00:17:51,111
Just let me know, okay?

231
00:17:52,321 --> 00:17:53,447
-I'm here.
-Hey.

232
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:01,246
Why are you looking at me like that?

233
00:18:02,206 --> 00:18:05,501
I feel embarrassed caking on makeup as if
I struck gold, so I do the bare minimum.

234
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:07,127
Why?

235
00:18:07,461 --> 00:18:08,545
It's been a long time, Gi-ok.

236
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:11,715
It's really been a long time.
You don't come out for yoga anymore.

237
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:13,050
I heard you moved.

238
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:15,344
Yes, have you been well?

239
00:18:16,845 --> 00:18:19,473
Let's not ask each other
if we've been well, okay?

240
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:21,934
I guess there's no way we've been well.

241
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:23,310
You're so lame.

242
00:18:25,813 --> 00:18:28,023
I must have really loved him.

243
00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:31,360
When I saw him with another woman...

244
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:34,696
I felt furious.

245
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:37,950
I didn't know I was that tacky, either.

246
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:42,037
I don't think I'm a Gangnam woman,
after all.

247
00:18:42,371 --> 00:18:44,540
That's how men and women differ.

248
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:47,334
Men are able to sleep with
women they don't love,

249
00:18:47,751 --> 00:18:50,254
but women can't sleep with a man
they don't have feelings for.

250
00:18:50,754 --> 00:18:53,590
All women feel physically attached and
fall in love after sleeping with a man.

251
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:56,343
That's why it's unfair
from the very beginning.

252
00:18:56,969 --> 00:19:00,639
I'm just going to keep seeing him
as if nothing happened.

253
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:05,394
I'll give him what he needs,
and receive what I need.

254
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:07,688
I'm just going to continue
this business relationship.

255
00:19:09,773 --> 00:19:12,109
I guess love isn't a part of my fate.

256
00:19:13,318 --> 00:19:16,780
Why wouldn't it be?
I'm certain that it lies ahead.

257
00:19:17,447 --> 00:19:19,825
It's just hard to find real love
at the right time.

258
00:19:20,868 --> 00:19:24,580
If I think about it,
I think love is all about timing.

259
00:19:28,292 --> 00:19:29,626
Let's have some dessert.

260
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:31,712
Yes, Ma'am.

261
00:19:32,504 --> 00:19:34,965
-Three glasses of Shakerato, please.
-Sure, I'll get it ready.

262
00:19:35,966 --> 00:19:38,844
Trust me and give it a try.
The Shakerato here is amazing.

263
00:19:39,303 --> 00:19:41,513
-I don't doubt it.
-I need to use the washroom.

264
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:47,603
Gi-ok, we're in trouble.

265
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:50,689
I heard from my husband that Bong-sik

266
00:19:50,772 --> 00:19:52,941
found out about Gyeong-hui and Dr. Jang.

267
00:19:54,318 --> 00:19:56,612
This incident blew out of proportion.

268
00:19:56,987 --> 00:19:59,448
-What?
-I don't think Bong-sik

269
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:00,782
will let Dr. Jang get away with it.

270
00:20:01,783 --> 00:20:02,993
I'm worried.

271
00:20:11,084 --> 00:20:12,669
"Initial public offering."

272
00:20:13,795 --> 00:20:17,758
It's difficult to be accepted
as a member of Seven Princesses.

273
00:20:18,091 --> 00:20:21,261
They're all women who possess
moral influence and intelligence.

274
00:20:22,846 --> 00:20:23,680
Yes?

275
00:20:28,435 --> 00:20:29,269
Ms. Park.

276
00:20:34,149 --> 00:20:35,234
I'll escort you.

277
00:20:35,651 --> 00:20:36,944
No, that's okay.

278
00:20:37,527 --> 00:20:39,696
I'll call you if I need you
when I'm finished.

279
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:42,241
I'm going to a personal gathering today.

280
00:20:43,325 --> 00:20:45,827
I'd like you to keep Mr. Chairman
company instead.

281
00:20:46,161 --> 00:20:47,037
Pardon?

282
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:51,208
He's going to feel very lonely
from now on.

283
00:20:56,838 --> 00:20:59,633
Don't spread the news item
even after the shareholders meeting.

284
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:03,053
Only spread it after I personally
call Mr. Kim

285
00:21:03,428 --> 00:21:04,680
in the PR department.

286
00:21:11,019 --> 00:21:13,730
Don't mess with me.

287
00:21:15,148 --> 00:21:16,608
If you do

288
00:21:17,859 --> 00:21:19,361
you'll be the one kicked out.

289
00:21:21,071 --> 00:21:22,531
Stop it!

290
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:26,201
Before I humiliate you
in front of your son!

291
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:29,621
This world doesn't function
based on the truth.

292
00:21:30,205 --> 00:21:32,499
What makes it function
is what becomes the truth.

293
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:34,918
Go break her.

294
00:21:35,544 --> 00:21:37,796
I must teach that woman a lesson.

295
00:21:38,547 --> 00:21:39,464
Will you be able to do it?

296
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:40,924
No.

297
00:21:41,675 --> 00:21:43,010
You have to do it.

298
00:22:21,757 --> 00:22:25,010
You promised you would leave
after Father's birthday.

299
00:22:25,427 --> 00:22:26,386
I'm...

300
00:22:29,097 --> 00:22:30,057
not going to...

301
00:22:31,725 --> 00:22:34,644
take a single step outside this house.

302
00:22:36,646 --> 00:22:37,814
What is it that you want?

303
00:22:40,275 --> 00:22:43,070
Tell me what you want.

304
00:22:45,697 --> 00:22:47,908
Tell me. What is it that you want?

305
00:22:56,124 --> 00:22:57,793
I want...

306
00:23:05,425 --> 00:23:06,384
Yes, Mr. Han.

307
00:23:07,469 --> 00:23:09,679
Yes, I'm almost there.

308
00:23:10,597 --> 00:23:11,515
Okay.

309
00:23:14,643 --> 00:23:16,019
Goodness.

310
00:23:16,978 --> 00:23:20,232
Last night, Seung-sook's husband
farted after falling asleep

311
00:23:20,315 --> 00:23:22,359
so it smelled so bad!

312
00:23:22,859 --> 00:23:25,320
-Tell us about it.
-About what?

313
00:23:25,403 --> 00:23:28,281
I mean, A-jin and that woman
are living in the same house.

314
00:23:29,116 --> 00:23:31,368
This isn't any ordinary entertainment.

315
00:23:31,451 --> 00:23:32,869
I don't want to hear it!

316
00:23:33,203 --> 00:23:36,164
A-jin's head already hurts
because of the rumors around town

317
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:39,334
saying that the mistress and
wife are living in the same house.

318
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:43,338
Have you heard?
Bong-sik's wife is pregnant.

319
00:23:43,755 --> 00:23:46,424
-But I heard it's not Bong-sik's child!
-Hey!

320
00:23:46,758 --> 00:23:49,261
-That's nonsense!
-Quiet down!

321
00:23:49,803 --> 00:23:51,263
This isn't Pung-suk's Kitchen.

322
00:23:51,555 --> 00:23:54,266
But don't you think our boss
at Pung-suk's Kitchen

323
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:55,934
has changed lately?

324
00:23:56,476 --> 00:23:59,938
She used to join us at the sauna,
but she said she won't come anymore.

325
00:24:00,021 --> 00:24:01,940
She's saying she made
all the money she wanted!

326
00:24:04,651 --> 00:24:06,778
Money changes people.

327
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:10,615
She's saying she's at
a different level than us now.

328
00:24:10,949 --> 00:24:14,286
I'm not surprised. Seeing how
Bok-ja's life turned around

329
00:24:15,078 --> 00:24:17,164
maybe our origin doesn't matter after all.

330
00:24:17,747 --> 00:24:20,417
-Money makes the person!
-Gosh!

331
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:24,504
Is it because this is cheap eyeshadow?
I can't seem to wash it off.

332
00:24:26,715 --> 00:24:28,758
Okay, this is bourbon from Russia.

333
00:24:29,342 --> 00:24:30,719
Why don't you try a glass?

334
00:24:55,869 --> 00:24:57,204
Do we have a new Mister?

335
00:24:57,537 --> 00:24:58,371
Yes, Ma'am.

336
00:24:59,164 --> 00:25:01,124
-Do you have a sponsor?
-Don't be like that.

337
00:25:01,541 --> 00:25:04,669
Is he yours? Why are you making him
do things like this?

338
00:25:04,961 --> 00:25:07,881
He said he wanted to say hello,
so I brought him with me.

339
00:25:08,506 --> 00:25:09,758
He's handsome.

340
00:25:11,218 --> 00:25:13,178
This is delicious. Cheers.

341
00:25:15,347 --> 00:25:16,890
When will our new member be here?

342
00:25:25,982 --> 00:25:28,485
Hello, I'm Ji-young Park.

343
00:25:31,529 --> 00:25:33,990
Let's cheers one more time. Here, cheers.

344
00:25:34,074 --> 00:25:35,909
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

345
00:25:47,963 --> 00:25:50,757
Then shall we test our new member?

346
00:25:50,924 --> 00:25:52,300
-Let's bring her out.
-Okay.

347
00:25:52,842 --> 00:25:54,552
Ma'am, please come out!

348
00:26:00,767 --> 00:26:01,643
Goodness!

349
00:26:06,022 --> 00:26:07,065
Me?

350
00:26:20,912 --> 00:26:22,706
Whoa! What the heck is this?

351
00:26:24,207 --> 00:26:26,084
Gosh!

352
00:26:30,046 --> 00:26:30,964
Gosh!

353
00:26:36,219 --> 00:26:38,430
-Allow her to join!
-Bravo!

354
00:26:44,477 --> 00:26:46,813
What the... Damn it!

355
00:26:53,111 --> 00:26:55,071
I'm sorry. I'm late, aren't I?

356
00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:57,532
My client is so busy.

357
00:26:57,991 --> 00:27:00,952
What else can I do?
I have to make a living. I'm sorry.

358
00:27:04,122 --> 00:27:06,833
-You have a hearing at 3 o'clock tomorrow.
-Okay.

359
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:09,252
It's for his fraudulent act. The thing is,

360
00:27:09,544 --> 00:27:12,088
I wanted to combine it with
the UN Village's ownership issue,

361
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:14,090
but that will take too long.

362
00:27:15,258 --> 00:27:17,802
So let's do that separately
with Ji-hu's custody case.

363
00:27:18,011 --> 00:27:19,471
Okay, let's do that.

364
00:27:19,554 --> 00:27:21,514
You have a 100 percent
of winning your divorce case,

365
00:27:21,598 --> 00:27:24,893
so let's win that, and use it to bounce
back and move onto the other cases.

366
00:27:25,101 --> 00:27:26,853
I'll leave it up to you.

367
00:27:26,936 --> 00:27:29,689
I want to make it so that the ruling
will be made in the first trial.

368
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:31,941
You'll really do that for me, right?

369
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,443
Of course.

370
00:27:35,987 --> 00:27:36,863
Thank you.

371
00:27:37,781 --> 00:27:38,656
For what?

372
00:27:39,616 --> 00:27:40,742
For helping me like this.

373
00:27:42,118 --> 00:27:44,621
I'll continue to make you
thankful from now on.

374
00:27:45,121 --> 00:27:46,164
You can look forward to it.

375
00:27:48,917 --> 00:27:51,836
But, has the defendant's side
appointed a lawyer?

376
00:27:51,961 --> 00:27:53,296
I heard they haven't.

377
00:27:53,755 --> 00:27:55,924
I think Seong-hui
has appointed one, though.

378
00:27:56,257 --> 00:27:58,009
I sent her a notice regarding
the fraudulence case.

379
00:27:58,676 --> 00:28:01,554
So you're saying you put the house
that was under her husband's name

380
00:28:01,638 --> 00:28:03,306
under your name,

381
00:28:03,598 --> 00:28:06,434
but the woman moved in,
insisting it's her house, right?

382
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:08,937
-And she sent you this notice, too.
-That's what we're telling you.

383
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:12,607
Do you plan to marry Jae-seok Ahn

384
00:28:12,690 --> 00:28:15,402
after that woman
and Jae-seok Ahn get divorced?

385
00:28:18,488 --> 00:28:21,032
I'm not sure about that...

386
00:28:21,491 --> 00:28:22,492
What's wrong with you?

387
00:28:22,575 --> 00:28:25,870
Mom, it looks like he's going to
lose the company.

388
00:28:26,996 --> 00:28:29,457
-What?
-I might go crazy.

389
00:28:30,417 --> 00:28:31,376
Mom!

390
00:28:35,463 --> 00:28:36,506
Dad!

391
00:28:40,969 --> 00:28:42,554
Has our little princess been well?

392
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:46,182
Do you want to eat some
delicious food with Dad? Get in.

393
00:28:48,643 --> 00:28:51,312
I'm making hash browns
that our princess loves so much.

394
00:28:54,482 --> 00:28:55,316
Dad?

395
00:28:56,693 --> 00:28:59,112
Okay, then. Eat lots of
delicious food with Dad, okay?

396
00:29:00,196 --> 00:29:01,364
I love you sweetie.

397
00:29:10,874 --> 00:29:11,916
Who is it?

398
00:29:17,797 --> 00:29:18,715
Is it true?

399
00:29:18,965 --> 00:29:21,426
Is it true that the wife and mistress
are living here together?

400
00:29:22,844 --> 00:29:25,388
-Who are you?
-I'm the president of the women's society.

401
00:29:25,472 --> 00:29:27,265
-I'm the general affairs officer.
-I'm the auditor.

402
00:29:27,348 --> 00:29:29,642
-I'm the director.
-Isn't this too crazy

403
00:29:29,726 --> 00:29:31,352
for our apartment's reputation?

404
00:29:31,436 --> 00:29:34,481
Your household's story
is all over the internet!

405
00:29:34,564 --> 00:29:36,566
Oh no. I'm sorry.

406
00:29:36,983 --> 00:29:38,151
I'm deeply ashamed.

407
00:29:39,986 --> 00:29:41,237
Why don't you come inside?

408
00:29:41,529 --> 00:29:43,490
And just so you know, I'm the wife.

409
00:29:43,823 --> 00:29:46,075
The mistress is out
at the moment. Come inside.

410
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:55,210
Ji-hu, what are you listening to today?

411
00:30:04,636 --> 00:30:06,304
Let's listen to your music together, Dad.

412
00:30:06,763 --> 00:30:08,348
You don't like this kind of music, though.

413
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:12,060
I'm going to do my best to understand you.

414
00:30:13,019 --> 00:30:14,938
No matter what other people say,

415
00:30:15,605 --> 00:30:18,691
I love you, Dad.

416
00:30:37,544 --> 00:30:38,753
I'm sorry.

417
00:30:41,798 --> 00:30:45,343
I'm sure Hansel and Gretel's dad
had his reasons.

418
00:30:46,344 --> 00:30:49,973
And I'm sure Cinderella's dad
had his reasons.

419
00:30:51,307 --> 00:30:54,727
So, I'm sure you had your reasons, too.

420
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:07,198
What do I do now?

421
00:31:08,157 --> 00:31:10,785
Hey, you heard what the lawyer asked.

422
00:31:11,202 --> 00:31:14,080
Did you write a memorandum
when you changed the ownership?

423
00:31:14,205 --> 00:31:16,082
Why couldn't you answer him properly?

424
00:31:16,833 --> 00:31:18,710
It said something about nominal trust

425
00:31:19,544 --> 00:31:22,463
but there were too many forms,
so I just stamped all of them.

426
00:31:22,839 --> 00:31:24,048
You have the forms at home, right?

427
00:31:24,382 --> 00:31:26,259
-Yeah, I think so.
-Where?

428
00:31:28,553 --> 00:31:31,097
That's why I took off his pants

429
00:31:31,514 --> 00:31:34,267
in the middle of it!

430
00:31:36,936 --> 00:31:40,064
You should have bought him
a car as an apology.

431
00:31:40,148 --> 00:31:42,483
All I did was take off his pants!

432
00:31:42,567 --> 00:31:44,569
Why should I buy him a car?

433
00:31:56,623 --> 00:31:59,459
Those dirty bitches.

434
00:32:01,878 --> 00:32:04,422
Besides having a lot of money,

435
00:32:04,505 --> 00:32:08,426
they're practically just like lowly scums.

436
00:32:10,178 --> 00:32:11,429
What is it that you want?

437
00:32:15,308 --> 00:32:18,311
Tell me what you want.

438
00:32:22,315 --> 00:32:25,693
You can tell me. What do you want?

439
00:32:25,777 --> 00:32:28,237
A-jin Woo. I can finally

440
00:32:28,696 --> 00:32:31,032
tell you exactly what I want.

441
00:32:31,407 --> 00:32:32,325
Cash!

442
00:32:33,159 --> 00:32:35,536
There's nothing special
about the upper class.

443
00:32:36,454 --> 00:32:38,414
All it takes is cash. Cash.

444
00:32:44,295 --> 00:32:45,296
Don't kiss me.

445
00:32:46,381 --> 00:32:47,215
Why not?

446
00:32:48,383 --> 00:32:49,717
Just don't do it.

447
00:32:51,552 --> 00:32:52,637
I'm going to wash up first.

448
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:15,076
Take it.

449
00:33:16,327 --> 00:33:19,580
I don't feel like rolling around
with you today.

450
00:33:23,209 --> 00:33:25,253
-Hyo-ju.
-What?

451
00:33:25,628 --> 00:33:28,381
You really like me, don't you?

452
00:33:30,466 --> 00:33:31,509
It's not like that.

453
00:33:36,514 --> 00:33:37,432
By the way,

454
00:33:38,057 --> 00:33:40,768
you said one of your friends
whom I met on the yacht

455
00:33:41,269 --> 00:33:43,021
is dating one of my friends.

456
00:33:43,396 --> 00:33:44,230
Who is it?

457
00:33:44,897 --> 00:33:46,858
-I don't know his name.
-Is he a player.

458
00:33:46,941 --> 00:33:47,900
No, he's not.

459
00:33:48,776 --> 00:33:52,196
He worked for her for a month.
But he quit because it wasn't his thing.

460
00:33:52,947 --> 00:33:55,700
It's not easy to quit
after getting a taste of money.

461
00:33:56,325 --> 00:33:59,662
Who's the woman? You'll recognize
her if I show you a picture, right?

462
00:34:00,204 --> 00:34:03,249
I can't tell you, though. My friend
asked me to keep it a secret.

463
00:34:03,833 --> 00:34:05,293
-Are they still seeing each other?
-Yeah.

464
00:34:06,002 --> 00:34:06,961
They love each other.

465
00:34:10,131 --> 00:34:11,758
Should I really go?

466
00:34:13,426 --> 00:34:14,552
Yeah, go.

467
00:34:15,553 --> 00:34:17,889
-Come on, let's just do it.
-I told you to go!

468
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:51,506
Honey,

469
00:34:51,881 --> 00:34:54,133
when you transferred the house
over to my name,

470
00:34:54,217 --> 00:34:56,511
we signed a trust agreement, didn't we?

471
00:34:58,971 --> 00:35:01,390
You know the agreement we signed
that you said you would keep

472
00:35:01,474 --> 00:35:02,725
just for formalities.

473
00:35:02,892 --> 00:35:05,478
-Seong-hui, let's...
-I'm...

474
00:35:05,812 --> 00:35:07,146
going to bury my bones in this house.

475
00:35:07,522 --> 00:35:08,648
Where's that memorandum?

476
00:35:09,148 --> 00:35:11,567
When you put this house under her name,

477
00:35:11,776 --> 00:35:14,237
did you sign a memorandum
that said it's under her name

478
00:35:14,487 --> 00:35:16,364
but the real owner is Jae-seok Ahn?

479
00:35:16,656 --> 00:35:18,699
-That's what we signed, isn't it?
-Hold on.

480
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:21,285
That's not what's important here.

481
00:35:23,663 --> 00:35:26,541
I need to talk to both of you.

482
00:35:26,999 --> 00:35:30,294
Please listen to what I'm
about to say very carefully.

483
00:35:31,796 --> 00:35:33,339
I'm going to make a shocking announcement.

484
00:35:33,422 --> 00:35:34,882
Hello, residents.

485
00:35:35,216 --> 00:35:37,718
I'm a resident living in building 105,
apartment 303.

486
00:35:38,427 --> 00:35:41,264
-I'm here to deliver a message.
-What's this?

487
00:35:41,722 --> 00:35:45,560
In building 105, apartment 303,
a wife and mistress are living together,

488
00:35:45,643 --> 00:35:49,856
causing frequent disorder
in a wretched living space.

489
00:35:50,523 --> 00:35:53,359
I'd like to sincerely apologize
for bringing down

490
00:35:53,442 --> 00:35:56,487
the dignity of UN Top Village, which is
known as a high-quality living space.

491
00:35:56,863 --> 00:35:57,780
I apologize.

492
00:35:58,281 --> 00:36:00,491
I will correct this corruption
as soon as possible.

493
00:36:00,575 --> 00:36:03,411
And in order to protect
the dignity of UN Top Village,

494
00:36:03,494 --> 00:36:05,746
I will solemnly promise
I will do my very best

495
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:09,417
to quickly resolve this grotesque
cohabitation issue of a mistress

496
00:36:09,667 --> 00:36:14,255
who is illegally occupying
our living space.

497
00:36:14,797 --> 00:36:17,758
Additionally, I ask that you participate
in our signature campaign

498
00:36:18,009 --> 00:36:20,344
in order to recover
our proper living space.

499
00:36:20,761 --> 00:36:22,972
Thank you, and I wish you
happiness everyone.

500
00:36:27,351 --> 00:36:29,520
Imagine how desperate I would
have been to move in here.

501
00:36:29,979 --> 00:36:31,606
I even left my daughter with my mother.

502
00:36:31,981 --> 00:36:35,651
What a total slut! You shouldn't
let her get away with that!

503
00:36:35,902 --> 00:36:37,737
Your baby's father is the worst!

504
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:40,698
I apologize, everyone.

505
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:42,950
I will resolve this as soon as possible.

506
00:36:43,576 --> 00:36:45,995
We should recover the
apartment's high-quality image.

507
00:36:46,787 --> 00:36:48,998
But in order to do that, I need your help.

508
00:36:49,332 --> 00:36:51,167
Just tell us. We'll do
whatever we can to help.

509
00:36:52,543 --> 00:36:54,378
I'm thinking of running
a signature campaign

510
00:36:54,962 --> 00:36:57,506
to recover our proper living space.

511
00:36:59,425 --> 00:37:01,344
I need to make my shocking announcement.

512
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:03,596
But she's taking the initiative.

513
00:37:04,305 --> 00:37:05,556
I can't deal with this.

514
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:09,518
I'm too embarrassed to go on.

515
00:37:10,978 --> 00:37:12,438
Let's sue her for defamation!

516
00:37:20,112 --> 00:37:20,947
Hello?

517
00:37:22,615 --> 00:37:23,574
What?

518
00:37:23,658 --> 00:37:25,618
Chairman Tae-dong Ahn of Daesung Pulp

519
00:37:25,701 --> 00:37:30,081
gave 53.41 percentage
of his own treasury stocks

520
00:37:30,206 --> 00:37:32,750
to his wife, Ji-young Park,

521
00:37:32,833 --> 00:37:35,127
which is shocking the financial world.

522
00:37:35,795 --> 00:37:38,214
As a result, Daesung Pulp,
which has a history of 30 years

523
00:37:38,297 --> 00:37:40,925
is now owned by
the Vice-Chairwoman, Ji-young Park

524
00:37:41,008 --> 00:37:42,927
in a historical turnaround.

525
00:37:46,514 --> 00:37:48,641
Chairman Tae-Dong Ahn Gives
53.41 Percent of His Shares

526
00:37:48,724 --> 00:37:50,184
To Vice-Chairwoman Ji-Young Park

527
00:37:59,443 --> 00:38:00,820
MESSAGE, KI-HO KANG

528
00:38:01,279 --> 00:38:02,363
Have you seen the news?

529
00:38:02,446 --> 00:38:04,365
About Daesung Pulp's
change of major shareholder.

530
00:38:05,992 --> 00:38:09,161
Chairman Tae-Dong Ahn Gives
53.41 Percent of His Shares

531
00:38:09,245 --> 00:38:12,498
To Vice-Chairwoman Ji-Young Park

532
00:38:19,755 --> 00:38:21,507
What will we do?

533
00:38:22,091 --> 00:38:24,677
Then, let's have a private talk
with Dad tomorrow.

534
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:28,973
I heard that company's sales
have been really good these days.

535
00:38:29,765 --> 00:38:30,725
That's why.

536
00:38:31,350 --> 00:38:32,852
Let's ask him for some shares

537
00:38:33,269 --> 00:38:35,438
and permission to participate
in the managing the business.

538
00:38:36,188 --> 00:38:38,691
I'll be the director. You can be
the managing director.

539
00:38:39,567 --> 00:38:42,862
No thanks. I'm going to leave
as soon as I get my shares.

540
00:38:43,362 --> 00:38:44,280
To the States.

541
00:38:45,364 --> 00:38:46,198
With Ju-mi?

542
00:38:48,367 --> 00:38:49,201
Yeah.

543
00:38:50,786 --> 00:38:52,330
You two sure are funny.

544
00:38:52,663 --> 00:38:54,582
Why did you overcook the squid?

545
00:38:55,249 --> 00:38:56,625
It's so tough, I might lose a tooth.

546
00:38:56,751 --> 00:38:57,752
Why didn't you bake it?

547
00:38:58,044 --> 00:38:59,920
And why did you mix in mayonnaise
with soy sauce?

548
00:39:00,046 --> 00:39:01,464
This is how people eat it these days!

549
00:39:02,298 --> 00:39:04,759
-Is this the Gangnam way?
-This is the Korean way.

550
00:39:06,552 --> 00:39:09,221
The new owner is Vice-Chairwoman
Ji-young Park...

551
00:39:21,484 --> 00:39:22,401
Honey?

552
00:39:23,319 --> 00:39:24,153
Hey.

553
00:39:25,154 --> 00:39:28,741
Don't worry too much.
I'll wrap it up properly.

554
00:39:30,409 --> 00:39:32,787
If we do that, I'll take all the insults

555
00:39:33,621 --> 00:39:35,539
even if we sell the company.

556
00:39:36,374 --> 00:39:39,752
Okay, in any case,
I believe in you, my love.

557
00:39:45,007 --> 00:39:46,634
I guess we were

558
00:39:47,468 --> 00:39:48,928
a match made in heaven.

559
00:39:50,638 --> 00:39:52,640
Of course, we are.

560
00:39:54,392 --> 00:39:55,267
I

561
00:39:55,810 --> 00:39:58,437
want to share many years with you

562
00:39:59,146 --> 00:40:00,356
as a married couple.

563
00:40:02,316 --> 00:40:03,317
Me too.

564
00:40:04,276 --> 00:40:05,403
But you know what?

565
00:40:07,238 --> 00:40:08,906
I've lived long enough to know

566
00:40:10,116 --> 00:40:13,494
that not everything goes my way.

567
00:40:21,669 --> 00:40:22,753
Thank you.

568
00:40:57,079 --> 00:40:59,248
I got the idea...

569
00:40:59,957 --> 00:41:01,417
that if I end up hating you, too,

570
00:41:02,209 --> 00:41:04,253
you'll have absolutely
no one left on your side.

571
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:08,174
I remember when you said,
"Bok-ja, I'm sorry,"

572
00:41:09,341 --> 00:41:11,677
and you emptied out your entire wallet

573
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:13,429
and gave me 80,000 won.

574
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:17,766
I forgave you...

575
00:41:19,602 --> 00:41:20,728
that day.

576
00:41:20,936 --> 00:41:23,981
Here's the 80,000 won you gave me
when I got out of prison.

577
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:25,691
It's a different game now.

578
00:41:27,193 --> 00:41:29,236
People who live roam about
in the upper class...

579
00:41:30,321 --> 00:41:31,614
have completely different blood.

580
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:37,369
I'm...

581
00:41:38,579 --> 00:41:40,456
no longer the Bok-ja Park from the past.

582
00:41:54,303 --> 00:41:55,346
I enjoyed the meal!

583
00:41:55,429 --> 00:41:56,805
-I had fun!
-Get home safely!

584
00:41:56,889 --> 00:41:58,015
Okay, see you tomorrow!

585
00:41:58,390 --> 00:41:59,391
-Hello.
-Nonhyeon-dong?

586
00:41:59,475 --> 00:42:01,393
-Yes.
-Great, thank you very much.

587
00:42:24,833 --> 00:42:26,335
Are you going somewhere
this late at night?

588
00:42:26,418 --> 00:42:27,294
It's...

589
00:42:27,378 --> 00:42:29,171
It's a global management course gathering.

590
00:42:30,214 --> 00:42:33,509
They want to go for a drink
because I took over a company.

591
00:42:34,718 --> 00:42:35,678
I see.

592
00:42:40,683 --> 00:42:41,934
Go to bed without me.

593
00:43:13,799 --> 00:43:15,759
Pack your bags and get out
first thing in the morning.

594
00:43:16,885 --> 00:43:18,887
Get out of my sight.

595
00:43:20,556 --> 00:43:21,974
What's wrong, Cho-hui?

596
00:43:23,767 --> 00:43:25,269
You told Mr. Chairman
about me, didn't you?

597
00:43:28,188 --> 00:43:31,567
I know everything just by looking
at a person's expression.

598
00:43:33,986 --> 00:43:35,654
You know the kind of life that I've lived.

599
00:43:37,156 --> 00:43:38,032
I've...

600
00:43:39,116 --> 00:43:40,868
been stepped on

601
00:43:41,869 --> 00:43:44,997
and looked down upon by countless people

602
00:43:45,873 --> 00:43:47,791
and worried about
what they thought about me.

603
00:43:52,129 --> 00:43:53,589
And I came out of it...

604
00:43:55,132 --> 00:43:56,175
with one advantage.

605
00:43:58,552 --> 00:43:59,386
I...

606
00:44:00,846 --> 00:44:02,723
can see everything.

607
00:44:03,557 --> 00:44:05,100
I felt like you were abandoning me.

608
00:44:06,352 --> 00:44:07,311
That's why.

609
00:44:09,813 --> 00:44:12,524
I wanted to abandon you
because I knew you were like this.

610
00:44:14,568 --> 00:44:16,278
It was just as I expected.

611
00:44:22,785 --> 00:44:23,702
I'm...

612
00:44:26,789 --> 00:44:27,915
abandoning you now.

613
00:44:33,087 --> 00:44:33,921
Get out...

614
00:44:35,589 --> 00:44:37,216
of this house first thing in the morning.

615
00:44:40,135 --> 00:44:41,845
If you try to play another trick on me...

616
00:44:44,473 --> 00:44:45,349
I'll kill you.

617
00:45:07,454 --> 00:45:08,288
Mom.

618
00:45:09,623 --> 00:45:11,166
Are you worried about something?

619
00:45:11,542 --> 00:45:12,501
No. Why?

620
00:45:13,168 --> 00:45:15,671
Your emotions are always
written all over your face.

621
00:45:15,921 --> 00:45:17,297
Is it because you have a pure soul?

622
00:45:18,424 --> 00:45:20,926
I read a line like that
in a book yesterday.

623
00:45:21,385 --> 00:45:24,054
It said people with pure souls
can't hide their emotions.

624
00:45:24,930 --> 00:45:26,473
You're a genius, Ji-hu Ahn.

625
00:45:27,141 --> 00:45:29,643
It seems like you're worried about
something other than Dad.

626
00:45:30,394 --> 00:45:31,270
Whoa.

627
00:45:31,687 --> 00:45:34,481
When it's about Dad, your eyes look sad,

628
00:45:34,690 --> 00:45:37,776
but right now, your eyes look...
how should I say it?

629
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:39,236
They look angry.

630
00:45:40,028 --> 00:45:41,405
-Do I look angry?
-Yeah.

631
00:45:42,114 --> 00:45:44,158
Then, I should blow off some
steam, shouldn't I?

632
00:45:44,450 --> 00:45:47,244
-You should.
-Then my princess should sleep, right?

633
00:45:47,411 --> 00:45:48,370
I should.

634
00:45:49,079 --> 00:45:50,080
Kiss.

635
00:45:51,748 --> 00:45:53,625
Okay, let's go to bed.

636
00:45:53,709 --> 00:45:56,086
6 MISSED CALLS, DIMWIT BONG-CHEOL

637
00:45:57,880 --> 00:46:01,091
Gosh, this worthless son of a bitch.

638
00:46:05,304 --> 00:46:07,431
-Hello?
-Can we meet right now?

639
00:46:10,851 --> 00:46:13,103
I have a gathering I need to get to.

640
00:46:14,438 --> 00:46:15,564
Let's meet up tomorrow.

641
00:46:16,899 --> 00:46:18,859
I have something to tell you anyway.

642
00:46:19,234 --> 00:46:20,819
Okay, see you tomorrow afternoon.

643
00:46:21,570 --> 00:46:22,404
Okay.

644
00:46:31,788 --> 00:46:33,916
What? Are you serious?

645
00:46:35,542 --> 00:46:38,754
Then did Dad give all of his
stocks to that woman? All of it?

646
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:42,841
Dad must be senile. That old man is crazy!

647
00:46:43,133 --> 00:46:44,259
Damn it!

648
00:46:46,512 --> 00:46:49,389
Why is everything going so wrong?

649
00:46:50,098 --> 00:46:53,810
Let's group together and try to
overcome this shitty situation, okay?

650
00:46:54,019 --> 00:46:55,938
Let's meet Dad tomorrow
and tell him to cancel it!

651
00:46:56,021 --> 00:46:57,523
Jae-gu! Jae-seok!

652
00:46:57,856 --> 00:47:00,984
I can't! I'm busy tomorrow.

653
00:47:01,109 --> 00:47:02,694
What's more important than this?

654
00:47:03,237 --> 00:47:05,405
I have my divorce hearing!

655
00:47:06,406 --> 00:47:09,326
I have a divorce hearing tomorrow!

656
00:47:12,829 --> 00:47:15,374
-I have a divorce hearing...
-Gosh, seriously!

657
00:47:23,173 --> 00:47:26,468
If you happen to grab me by the hair
or something, you'll be on the news.

658
00:47:26,635 --> 00:47:29,304
So think before you act from now on.

659
00:47:29,763 --> 00:47:33,225
Your husband ruined my daughter's future!

660
00:47:33,475 --> 00:47:36,979
Oh my, I did? Didn't you love each other?

661
00:47:37,646 --> 00:47:41,525
In love, you must overcome
all adversity and hardship.

662
00:47:42,901 --> 00:47:45,070
Did you love a married man
without bracing yourself for this?

663
00:47:45,779 --> 00:47:47,948
I have a trial tomorrow.
You should attend.

664
00:47:48,407 --> 00:47:51,118
You need to know the circumstances
to be prepared.

665
00:47:51,243 --> 00:47:52,327
I better get going now.

666
00:48:09,303 --> 00:48:12,264
I'm late with the introductions,
aren't I? I'll do that now.

667
00:48:13,098 --> 00:48:15,434
This is Ms. Dong-ju Park
of Samcheong Boilers.

668
00:48:16,143 --> 00:48:17,728
It was recently listed in KOSDAQ.

669
00:48:19,062 --> 00:48:21,565
This is Ms. Young-ah Yoo
of Zero Nine Construction.

670
00:48:21,982 --> 00:48:25,819
She took over Youngan Industries and
will sign a five billion deal tomorrow.

671
00:48:26,737 --> 00:48:27,654
And this is...

672
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:30,616
I'm Ja-sil Choi.

673
00:48:31,199 --> 00:48:34,745
At first, I also sold my company
and got my hands on a lot of cash.

674
00:48:35,454 --> 00:48:37,581
I even managed funding firms
with that money.

675
00:48:37,873 --> 00:48:39,583
She's the representative
of CJS Investment Bank.

676
00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:42,753
Let's just say she plays a large role
in our country's black economy.

677
00:48:43,795 --> 00:48:44,796
No need to introduce myself.

678
00:48:45,672 --> 00:48:48,759
You know how well our company's
doing, don't you?

679
00:48:49,843 --> 00:48:51,511
I really like her.

680
00:48:53,764 --> 00:48:55,390
How much are you going to sell it for?

681
00:48:57,309 --> 00:48:58,602
I want 75 billion won in cash.

682
00:48:59,353 --> 00:49:01,647
Twenty billion won for the gift tax
must be paid

683
00:49:01,730 --> 00:49:03,106
by the Seven Princesses' joint account.

684
00:49:03,732 --> 00:49:06,193
And it must be deposited in advance
before the transfer of stocks.

685
00:49:11,948 --> 00:49:13,158
Take it or leave it.

686
00:49:16,453 --> 00:49:18,163
We should discuss it, shouldn't we?

687
00:49:18,288 --> 00:49:21,208
Let's discuss it together.
I'm a member, too.

688
00:49:24,753 --> 00:49:27,506
Okay, let's discuss it
in a transparent manner.

689
00:49:29,591 --> 00:49:31,009
How about another toast?

690
00:49:33,428 --> 00:49:35,681
-Cheers?
-Cheers!

691
00:50:23,603 --> 00:50:26,982
I think someone will buy the company soon.

692
00:50:27,733 --> 00:50:30,694
-Pardon?
-I expressed my intention to sell it,

693
00:50:31,069 --> 00:50:32,904
and quite a few buyers showed interest.

694
00:50:33,780 --> 00:50:35,365
You didn't even consult me about this.

695
00:50:36,616 --> 00:50:38,034
Anyway, that's good.

696
00:50:39,703 --> 00:50:41,788
Don't tell the kids about that
for the time being.

697
00:50:42,539 --> 00:50:44,374
Why would I do that and cause a fuss?

698
00:50:46,001 --> 00:50:47,002
By the way,

699
00:50:47,711 --> 00:50:49,838
you know that Jae-seok's divorce hearing
is today, right?

700
00:50:53,133 --> 00:50:53,967
My love.

701
00:50:55,427 --> 00:50:56,845
-Yes?
-I...

702
00:50:58,722 --> 00:51:00,056
can't part ways with you.

703
00:51:03,643 --> 00:51:06,146
-Why do you say that...
-I trust you.

704
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:13,570
Why does that keep sounding
like you can't trust me?

705
00:51:18,408 --> 00:51:20,494
I forgot that I have
a meeting this morning.

706
00:51:21,745 --> 00:51:22,621
Don't...

707
00:51:24,414 --> 00:51:25,332
forget to eat.

708
00:51:26,374 --> 00:51:27,250
Honey!

709
00:51:40,430 --> 00:51:44,392
Yes, Mr. Han. I need you
to speed up the process.

710
00:51:45,018 --> 00:51:45,852
Yes.

711
00:51:47,062 --> 00:51:48,230
Yes, please do that.

712
00:51:53,318 --> 00:51:56,446
Case 2017-10122.

713
00:51:56,905 --> 00:51:58,740
We will begin the divorce trial.

714
00:51:59,574 --> 00:52:01,076
Are both parties present?

715
00:52:01,868 --> 00:52:03,662
You were unable to come to terms
through mediation.

716
00:52:04,996 --> 00:52:07,374
The plaintiff's lawyer
may give his statement.

717
00:52:10,627 --> 00:52:14,798
The plaintiff and defendant
were legally wed in May of 2007

718
00:52:15,048 --> 00:52:16,716
and currently have one daughter.

719
00:52:18,009 --> 00:52:20,762
The defendant, Jae-seok Ahn
started having an affair

720
00:52:21,096 --> 00:52:24,432
with his daughter's art teacher,
Seong-hui Yun since October of 2016,

721
00:52:24,766 --> 00:52:26,393
and caused his marriage to fail.

722
00:52:27,811 --> 00:52:29,813
He is even living with
the so-called Seong-hui Yun

723
00:52:30,021 --> 00:52:32,274
and committed acts of brutality

724
00:52:32,732 --> 00:52:34,359
that prevented their marriage
from surviving.

725
00:52:34,526 --> 00:52:37,779
The defendant's actions fall under
Article 840, Clause 1,

726
00:52:38,405 --> 00:52:40,740
for wrongful conduct toward his spouse,

727
00:52:41,074 --> 00:52:42,742
and Article 840, Clause 6,

728
00:52:43,535 --> 00:52:47,414
for providing a critical reason that makes
it difficult for the marriage to continue,

729
00:52:47,497 --> 00:52:49,416
which are valid reasons
for this judicial divorce.

730
00:52:49,499 --> 00:52:51,585
JUDGE

731
00:52:51,668 --> 00:52:53,295
Defendant, do you have an attorney?

732
00:52:54,629 --> 00:52:55,547
No, I don't.

733
00:52:56,715 --> 00:52:58,633
Don't you have anything to say?

734
00:52:59,676 --> 00:53:02,095
Have courage and speak your mind.

735
00:53:07,893 --> 00:53:09,144
I love my wife.

736
00:53:09,686 --> 00:53:11,521
And I don't want this divorce.

737
00:53:12,397 --> 00:53:15,483
I will publicly announce it
in the court of law.

738
00:53:16,151 --> 00:53:17,068
I...

739
00:53:19,613 --> 00:53:21,156
will end my relationship with that woman.

740
00:53:22,699 --> 00:53:23,950
By "that woman"...

741
00:53:24,034 --> 00:53:26,745
I'm talking about the woman
I'm seeing besides my wife.

742
00:53:28,288 --> 00:53:29,414
COURT

743
00:53:29,497 --> 00:53:30,707
LAWYER, PLAINTIFF

744
00:53:30,832 --> 00:53:32,626
It sounds like he made
this decision today.

745
00:53:32,709 --> 00:53:34,794
That's not true.
I made this decision yesterday.

746
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:37,213
My decision remains unchanged.

747
00:53:37,297 --> 00:53:39,466
A-jin! I love you!

748
00:53:39,716 --> 00:53:41,885
Plaintiff, if you have anything
to say, go ahead.

749
00:53:44,554 --> 00:53:47,974
I just thought of what my lawyer told me
about the seriousness of marriage.

750
00:53:48,808 --> 00:53:50,435
He said, my husband

751
00:53:50,977 --> 00:53:52,771
thought of our marriage very
lightly compared to me.

752
00:53:54,272 --> 00:53:55,190
I'd like to take

753
00:53:56,358 --> 00:53:58,902
this opportunity to make one apology
to my husband.

754
00:54:01,279 --> 00:54:02,864
I took this marriage

755
00:54:03,698 --> 00:54:06,701
just as lightly as my husband did.

756
00:54:11,247 --> 00:54:14,960
Before we got married, he gave me
a ride in a top, foreign luxury car.

757
00:54:15,961 --> 00:54:18,922
It was on a cold, winter day,
and he put on the heater.

758
00:54:20,298 --> 00:54:22,884
As soon as he turned it on,
I was embraced by the heat.

759
00:54:24,386 --> 00:54:27,222
At that moment, my husband
opened the sunroof.

760
00:54:28,223 --> 00:54:31,393
With the heater and sunroof,
it felt really comfortable.

761
00:54:32,143 --> 00:54:36,106
At that moment, I decided to marry him.

762
00:54:38,525 --> 00:54:41,861
"This man will provide me
with the most comfort."

763
00:54:43,655 --> 00:54:45,490
That's what marriage meant to me.

764
00:54:48,827 --> 00:54:51,246
I finally came to realize how foolish

765
00:54:52,205 --> 00:54:53,248
that decision was.

766
00:54:57,585 --> 00:55:00,588
LAWYER, PLAINTIFF

767
00:55:09,723 --> 00:55:11,933
I feel that the persons involved
said everything they wanted to,

768
00:55:12,183 --> 00:55:15,395
and since the case has been tried,
I will make my final ruling

769
00:55:15,770 --> 00:55:16,896
without wasting any time.

770
00:55:17,731 --> 00:55:20,108
The divorce lawsuit filed by A-jin Woo,

771
00:55:20,942 --> 00:55:22,944
will be granted a divorce,

772
00:55:23,528 --> 00:55:25,280
just as A-jin Woo requested.

773
00:55:27,282 --> 00:55:29,409
Wait, what the heck is this?

774
00:55:29,743 --> 00:55:31,369
You can't do this, Judge!

775
00:55:31,953 --> 00:55:32,871
Judge!

776
00:55:33,538 --> 00:55:34,998
Can't you hear me? Judge!

777
00:55:38,001 --> 00:55:38,918
Sir.

778
00:55:40,003 --> 00:55:40,879
Ms. Park...

779
00:55:42,380 --> 00:55:45,675
Sir, Ms. Park sold
all of the company shares

780
00:55:46,885 --> 00:55:48,261
to a private equity fund.

781
00:55:49,971 --> 00:55:52,557
And since then, no one has been able

782
00:55:54,350 --> 00:55:55,560
to get a hold of her.

783
00:56:37,894 --> 00:56:39,938
I do have the vice chairwoman title,
but in reality,

784
00:56:40,730 --> 00:56:42,315
I don't even have any shares.

785
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:44,609
I've actually been thinking
about making some changes.

786
00:56:45,735 --> 00:56:46,945
Really?

787
00:56:47,028 --> 00:56:48,530
Why should we even grow the business?

788
00:56:48,613 --> 00:56:50,782
None of your children
is competent enough to inherit it.

789
00:56:51,366 --> 00:56:55,203
Since the company is doing so well now,
you should sell it

790
00:56:55,328 --> 00:56:57,247
and keep the cash.

791
00:57:08,216 --> 00:57:09,259
Thank you.

792
00:57:56,639 --> 00:57:57,974
-Hello?
-Ms. Woo.

793
00:57:58,433 --> 00:58:01,060
Ms. Park, Mr. Chairman collapsed!

794
00:58:01,144 --> 00:58:02,437
Mr. Chairman has collapsed!

795
00:58:24,250 --> 00:58:28,004
As you can all see, MK Capital is now
the majority shareholder of Daesung Pulp.

796
00:58:28,129 --> 00:58:29,672
She obviously did it behind Dad's back.

797
00:58:29,756 --> 00:58:32,175
Mr. Chairman was the one
who wanted to sell the company.

798
00:58:32,467 --> 00:58:35,386
I told you that she needs to leave.

799
00:58:35,595 --> 00:58:37,347
Why didn't you listen to me?

800
00:58:38,264 --> 00:58:40,850
You punk, how dare you eat up
the company all by yourself?

801
00:58:40,934 --> 00:58:42,143
Give us our shares!

802
00:58:42,227 --> 00:58:43,561
Why are you guys doing this to me?

803
00:58:43,770 --> 00:58:46,439
Tell me where Bok-ja Park is.
Isn't that where you're going?

804
00:58:46,523 --> 00:58:47,649
How much is she giving you?

805
00:58:47,982 --> 00:58:49,108
What a bat.

806
00:58:50,235 --> 00:58:53,363
I'll give your husband back to you,
so give me back my paintings.

807
00:58:53,446 --> 00:58:54,989
What do you think you're doing now?

808
00:58:55,073 --> 00:58:57,742
Just live happily ever after
with Jae-seok Ahn

809
00:58:57,825 --> 00:58:59,369
and keep painting.

810
00:58:59,577 --> 00:59:01,204
-What?
-We'll give you exactly 15 days.

811
00:59:01,287 --> 00:59:03,581
If you don't move out by then,
we'll disseminate these photos.

812
00:59:03,665 --> 00:59:05,583
Don't try any tricks with me.

813
00:59:05,875 --> 00:59:07,669
You know we're in the same boat.

814
00:59:07,961 --> 00:59:09,504
Do you want to get the company back?

815
00:59:10,088 --> 00:59:12,840
What if they're seeing each other?
A-jin wouldn't do that.

816
00:59:12,924 --> 00:59:14,968
You never know what can happen
between a man and a woman.

817
00:59:15,134 --> 00:59:16,302
What should I do now?

818
00:59:16,844 --> 00:59:19,681
I tracked the location of her cell phone.
What should I do?

819
00:59:20,098 --> 00:59:22,267
Let's kill her. We have to kill her.

820
00:59:22,642 --> 00:59:24,102
That's the only way.

821
00:59:29,524 --> 00:59:31,526
