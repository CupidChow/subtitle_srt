1
00:00:44,919 --> 00:00:47,046
Who do you think it is? The killer.

2
00:00:47,589 --> 00:00:48,840
I'm not sure.

3
00:00:48,923 --> 00:00:51,885
Everyone in Gangnam
is talking about her death.

4
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:56,181
A-jin impresses me so much.

5
00:00:56,806 --> 00:00:58,433
She sure is impressive.

6
00:00:58,641 --> 00:01:01,102
She said she won't sue
for alimony or division of property.

7
00:01:01,519 --> 00:01:03,646
I think she'll just end it
with that house alone.

8
00:01:04,022 --> 00:01:06,649
She said that she deserves the house
for all the efforts that she has made.

9
00:01:08,568 --> 00:01:10,653
So many crazy things have happened
around her, you know.

10
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:12,781
But somehow,
she managed to keep it together.

11
00:01:12,864 --> 00:01:14,866
She's mentally healthy.

12
00:01:15,575 --> 00:01:19,287
Gosh, I hope Su-min becomes like her.
I don't want her to take after me.

13
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:23,500
Divorce...

14
00:01:24,334 --> 00:01:26,586
It may be the last stage of marriage.

15
00:01:27,796 --> 00:01:30,507
Doesn't every married couple think
about getting divorced at least once?

16
00:01:32,133 --> 00:01:33,384
That's true.

17
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:36,179
By the way,

18
00:01:37,222 --> 00:01:40,308
I heard that Gyeong-hui has been
getting severe morning sickness.

19
00:01:45,146 --> 00:01:47,023
Yun-jae is leaving soon
to go to school abroad.

20
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:49,442
They're sending him to the boarding school
Do-hyeon is attending.

21
00:01:56,825 --> 00:01:59,035
You said that you broke up
with that boyfriend of yours.

22
00:01:59,911 --> 00:02:01,454
You must be bored these days.

23
00:02:02,622 --> 00:02:05,834
Rich women who are passionate
and have a ton of time on their hands

24
00:02:05,917 --> 00:02:07,252
are the most unfortunate ones.

25
00:02:07,877 --> 00:02:09,420
I'm one of them.

26
00:02:11,297 --> 00:02:12,799
You're so spoiled.

27
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:17,387
I miss A-jin.

28
00:02:18,096 --> 00:02:19,305
She must be very busy these days.

29
00:02:19,556 --> 00:02:22,350
Seoul High Court is now in session

30
00:02:22,433 --> 00:02:25,687
for an oral argument hearing
appealing the divorce case, 2017R-21315.

31
00:02:26,855 --> 00:02:29,107
The respondent isn't here though.

32
00:02:30,233 --> 00:02:34,279
Appellant, you wrote "No reason"
as the reason for your appeal

33
00:02:34,487 --> 00:02:35,947
in the form you submitted.

34
00:02:36,281 --> 00:02:39,159
Appellant, is there anything specific
you'd like to tell us?

35
00:02:41,661 --> 00:02:43,037
Your Honor,

36
00:02:43,788 --> 00:02:45,748
I cannot accept this divorce.

37
00:02:46,124 --> 00:02:48,668
I will protect my wife and my family,

38
00:02:48,751 --> 00:02:51,170
even if this country...
I mean, even if this world falls apart.

39
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:53,423
Since the respondent isn't here today,

40
00:02:53,798 --> 00:02:55,800
we'll have to reschedule this trial.

41
00:02:56,509 --> 00:02:58,511
What did I do so wrong?

42
00:02:58,595 --> 00:03:00,179
Please at least answer my question.

43
00:03:00,263 --> 00:03:01,764
Did you break it off with that woman?

44
00:03:02,223 --> 00:03:03,224
Which woman?

45
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:04,851
Goodness.

46
00:03:06,978 --> 00:03:09,480
Wait, Your Honor. Your Honor!

47
00:03:14,402 --> 00:03:17,113
We received NFS' official autopsy report.

48
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,992
The time of death is presumed to be
between 2 a.m. and 4 a.m. on February 28.

49
00:03:21,409 --> 00:03:24,704
She had wine with cheese
about an hour before she died

50
00:03:24,787 --> 00:03:27,332
and a significant amount of barium,
which is commonly used

51
00:03:27,415 --> 00:03:30,668
for psychiatric medication,
was found in her stomach.

52
00:03:30,835 --> 00:03:32,712
That must mean she had been
seeing a psychiatrist.

53
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,923
Correct. We did some digging and found out

54
00:03:35,006 --> 00:03:38,092
that she was seeing a psychiatrist
for about a month.

55
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:41,596
Also, she couldn't fall asleep
without sleeping pills.

56
00:03:42,388 --> 00:03:44,474
We've tracked down
Bong-cheol Gu's whereabouts.

57
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:57,028
Hello?

58
00:03:57,111 --> 00:03:58,029
It's me.

59
00:03:58,655 --> 00:04:00,281
I'm going to the police station now.

60
00:04:00,365 --> 00:04:04,118
You remember what I told you, right?
Dump everything on Bok-ja Park.

61
00:04:05,286 --> 00:04:08,331
That woman, Bok-ja Park. Bok-ja Park!

62
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:10,208
She's already dead.

63
00:04:15,296 --> 00:04:17,924
Mr. Gu. Hey, Bong-cheol Gu!

64
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:27,016
SEOUL GANGNAM POLICE STATION

65
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,017
Why did you run away?

66
00:04:29,477 --> 00:04:30,812
I never ran away.

67
00:04:31,062 --> 00:04:33,523
We issued a number of appearance notices.

68
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:36,234
We were only able to catch you
after circulating wanted posters.

69
00:04:36,317 --> 00:04:37,652
I didn't kill her.

70
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:39,862
It's our job to find out
whether you did it or not.

71
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:43,366
I heard from Ms. A-jin Woo

72
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,327
that Ji-yeong Park could move
into Chairman Ahn's residence

73
00:04:46,828 --> 00:04:47,829
because of you.

74
00:04:48,204 --> 00:04:49,372
You colluded with her

75
00:04:50,039 --> 00:04:52,917
and you were instrumental
in helping her marry Chairman Ahn.

76
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:59,007
Did you feel deeply betrayed by her?

77
00:05:01,592 --> 00:05:02,468
Yes.

78
00:05:04,095 --> 00:05:05,596
I did feel betrayed at the beginning.

79
00:05:08,099 --> 00:05:09,350
I resented her.

80
00:05:11,185 --> 00:05:12,854
But I came to understand her
at some point.

81
00:05:14,022 --> 00:05:16,524
Suddenly becoming a member of high society
can change you, you know.

82
00:05:17,525 --> 00:05:19,610
I just told myself that such a change
was inevitable.

83
00:05:20,945 --> 00:05:24,365
Do you have an alibi
for the day that she died?

84
00:05:25,908 --> 00:05:28,077
The elder son's wife
ordered me to kill her.

85
00:05:28,786 --> 00:05:31,122
That's when I knew
that Bok-ja would get killed soon

86
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:33,249
if the situation didn't change.

87
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:37,086
I hated her too,
but I could not bring myself to kill her.

88
00:05:40,214 --> 00:05:43,051
Where have you been? And what
have you been doing all this time?

89
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:48,139
I helped my friend out
at his fitness center in Daejeon.

90
00:05:48,222 --> 00:05:51,017
How did you hear
about Ji-yeong Park's death?

91
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:53,478
I saw it on the news.

92
00:05:57,190 --> 00:06:01,360
Do you have evidence to prove that
Ms. Ju-mi Park ordered you to kill her?

93
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:04,030
No, I don't.

94
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:07,450
She'd never leave any evidence behind.

95
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:11,204
She'll manage to evade the police net
no matter how hard you try.

96
00:06:13,289 --> 00:06:14,791
She's extremely clever.

97
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:18,669
We didn't need
the security company's service anymore.

98
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:21,047
That's the only reason
why I canceled our contract with them.

99
00:06:21,422 --> 00:06:24,884
As you know, people were
gossiping about our family like crazy.

100
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:28,763
"A caregiver seduced the chairman
and ran away with a huge chunk of money."

101
00:06:30,348 --> 00:06:32,600
I couldn't stand the fact
that they were watching us

102
00:06:32,767 --> 00:06:35,061
and I also hated that
we were monitoring them.

103
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:38,356
I hate security cameras.

104
00:06:38,564 --> 00:06:40,149
I heard that you were

105
00:06:40,983 --> 00:06:43,861
with your husband at Leo Resort
on February 28.

106
00:06:44,403 --> 00:06:45,696
Is it true?

107
00:06:46,447 --> 00:06:48,741
-Yes.
-Do you have an alibi?

108
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:52,662
I guess my husband and I will have to be
each other's witness.

109
00:06:54,413 --> 00:06:55,748
You've solicited Bong-cheol Gu

110
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:59,085
to kill Ji-yeong Park, haven't you?

111
00:07:04,006 --> 00:07:05,049
Detective.

112
00:07:05,842 --> 00:07:07,510
I'm a professor.

113
00:07:08,302 --> 00:07:12,223
Well, I do admit that I hated her
to the point that I wanted to kill her.

114
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:16,018
However, I know better than to risk
losing everything I have

115
00:07:16,227 --> 00:07:19,313
just to kill a woman like her.

116
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:24,694
We checked dashboard camera footage
from a car that was parked nearby.

117
00:07:25,403 --> 00:07:28,364
A man walking into the house was caught
on the camera from behind.

118
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,994
There were actually two men.

119
00:07:50,052 --> 00:07:52,805
Well, they were holding umbrellas
as it was raining,

120
00:07:53,055 --> 00:07:55,433
so we haven't been able to confirm
their identities,

121
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:57,560
but it's possible

122
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:01,772
that Bong-cheol Gu was one of them.

123
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:06,861
Tell us. Have you really been bugging
all of our conversations?

124
00:08:07,403 --> 00:08:09,739
No, of course not.
It's just a misunderstanding.

125
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:13,534
The rumor has spread all over Gangnam.

126
00:08:13,618 --> 00:08:15,953
We heard that Bok-ja Park
tipped off a reporter.

127
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:18,247
Before she died,
she said that the reporter will expose

128
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:20,374
all of your dirty deeds.

129
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:23,127
He's waiting for the right time
to drop the bomb.

130
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:25,046
Gosh, that is absolutely crazy.

131
00:08:25,755 --> 00:08:27,673
By the way,
where did you hear about all this?

132
00:08:27,757 --> 00:08:29,675
Have you heard of Gangnam Paparazzi?

133
00:08:29,842 --> 00:08:32,386
It's a tabloid that covers all kinds of
rumors about people in Gangnam

134
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:33,638
and they covered the rumor.

135
00:08:34,096 --> 00:08:35,806
Anyway, it's not true.

136
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:38,142
Why would I plant a bug here?
That is just crazy.

137
00:08:38,226 --> 00:08:40,520
If that's the case,
can we search the place?

138
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:44,815
Of course. Search all you want.

139
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,406
Enough!

140
00:08:52,573 --> 00:08:55,409
We didn't even talk
about anything important.

141
00:08:55,493 --> 00:08:57,328
Why would she bug our conversations?

142
00:08:57,662 --> 00:08:59,956
Right, they were all just chitchats.

143
00:09:05,795 --> 00:09:08,756
She's definitely hiding something.

144
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:12,343
I've been suspicious of her
for some time now.

145
00:09:12,718 --> 00:09:14,845
She knows everything

146
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:17,682
that we've talked about.

147
00:09:18,015 --> 00:09:19,559
Ladies, come out for a second.

148
00:09:26,148 --> 00:09:28,025
She's the Pungsan family's
new housekeeper.

149
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:31,696
Did they hire her as Yeo-ul's replacement
after firing her?

150
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:34,282
No, I'm just a helper.

151
00:09:34,448 --> 00:09:36,284
I don't clean or cook.

152
00:09:36,367 --> 00:09:39,870
I run Mr. Chairman's errands
and assist him with his meals.

153
00:09:41,122 --> 00:09:43,749
Did his wife hire you herself?
She didn't, right?

154
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:45,751
She's the one who hired me.

155
00:09:46,168 --> 00:09:48,087
I'll have a lot to learn,
so please help me out.

156
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:57,513
I've downloaded the security camera
footage from February 28.

157
00:09:57,847 --> 00:09:58,889
Thank you.

158
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:41,307
The suspect is here.

159
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:45,102
So, what happened when you got home?

160
00:10:45,186 --> 00:10:47,355
Exactly as you said the other day.

161
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:49,649
I went in and killed her.

162
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:53,110
I was so furious
that I couldn't control my anger.

163
00:10:54,403 --> 00:10:55,655
That's why I killed her.

164
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:56,739
Answer me.

165
00:10:58,366 --> 00:10:59,659
Did you really kill her?

166
00:11:00,785 --> 00:11:04,747
Goodness, I just told you that I did.
Why don't you believe me?

167
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:07,333
Why are you turning yourself in?

168
00:11:10,086 --> 00:11:11,128
Just because.

169
00:11:14,882 --> 00:11:16,133
Killing someone

170
00:11:18,594 --> 00:11:19,929
can deeply agonize you.

171
00:11:21,847 --> 00:11:26,018
It's better to get locked up in jail
because it'll free me from this torture.

172
00:11:30,398 --> 00:11:31,607
I can't take this.

173
00:11:37,822 --> 00:11:38,948
I need peace of mind.

174
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:44,412
I'm doing it for peace of mind.

175
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:57,007
The killer who murdered Ji-yeong Park,
the vice chairwoman of Daesung Pulp,

176
00:11:57,091 --> 00:11:58,342
turned himself in today.

177
00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:01,637
The killer is Jae-gu Ahn,
the victim's stepson

178
00:12:01,804 --> 00:12:05,558
and the eldest son of the former chairman
of Daesung Pulp, Tae-dong Ahn.

179
00:12:06,684 --> 00:12:10,146
The police stated that he murdered
the victim due to his resentment

180
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:12,481
toward her for selling
Chairman Ahn's shares and running away

181
00:12:12,773 --> 00:12:16,402
and that it was
a spur-of-the-moment choice.

182
00:12:17,153 --> 00:12:20,197
The police also stated that
the two of them have had

183
00:12:20,281 --> 00:12:24,201
a hostile relationship since
he returned from the US last year

184
00:12:24,535 --> 00:12:27,037
as they didn't see eye to eye
on matters related to inheritance.

185
00:13:05,659 --> 00:13:07,578
Mom, are you worried about something?

186
00:13:08,787 --> 00:13:09,747
No.

187
00:13:11,123 --> 00:13:14,084
Ji-hu, you've never told
your friends at school

188
00:13:14,168 --> 00:13:17,338
about Grandpa's company, right?

189
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:18,881
Why would I?

190
00:13:18,964 --> 00:13:21,217
They'll call me Toilet Paper
if they find out about Dad working

191
00:13:21,342 --> 00:13:23,802
at a toilet paper company
because they're so childish.

192
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:26,764
Right. I'm glad you haven't told anyone.

193
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:29,058
Don't tell anyone, okay?

194
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:29,975
I won't.

195
00:13:42,696 --> 00:13:44,990
You didn't write anything
in your English journal today.

196
00:13:45,616 --> 00:13:48,244
I want to do it only three times a week.

197
00:13:48,577 --> 00:13:51,997
I've been writing about sad stuff,
so I don't want to write too often.

198
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:56,835
Mom.

199
00:13:57,878 --> 00:14:00,339
I like this house. It smells nice here.

200
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:05,803
I'm glad to hear that you're happy here.
Mom is going to bed too, okay?

201
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:07,471
Okay, sweet dreams.

202
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:44,300
It's me.

203
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:45,926
Hey.

204
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:49,513
Is Ji-hu sleeping?

205
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:51,223
Yes.

206
00:14:58,188 --> 00:14:59,481
I'm sorry, A-jin.

207
00:15:03,777 --> 00:15:04,904
Me too.

208
00:15:06,447 --> 00:15:07,698
I'm sorry about everything.

209
00:15:08,365 --> 00:15:09,950
Jae-gu...

210
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:13,579
What should I do now?

211
00:15:15,789 --> 00:15:17,291
Why did he do such a thing?

212
00:15:21,128 --> 00:15:22,546
He turned himself in.

213
00:15:24,131 --> 00:15:26,133
We'll get his sentence mitigated.

214
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:29,720
Let's do our best to help him out.

215
00:15:33,515 --> 00:15:34,808
Stop crying.

216
00:15:35,976 --> 00:15:39,521
After all, tomorrow is another day.

217
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,696
I'm sorry.

218
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:53,535
I shouldn't have

219
00:15:56,038 --> 00:15:58,290
hired her.

220
00:16:04,922 --> 00:16:06,006
I'm sorry.

221
00:16:11,428 --> 00:16:13,055
I was the one

222
00:16:14,932 --> 00:16:18,185
who introduced that painter to you

223
00:16:21,105 --> 00:16:22,439
and Father

224
00:16:23,899 --> 00:16:25,693
met that woman because of me.

225
00:16:28,112 --> 00:16:29,780
That's not your fault.

226
00:16:32,574 --> 00:16:34,660
Those who made the choices are at fault.

227
00:16:50,592 --> 00:16:52,219
-Namaste.
-Namaste.

228
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:00,060
Are things going well?

229
00:17:00,561 --> 00:17:02,438
-What things?
-Everything.

230
00:17:05,149 --> 00:17:07,609
I heard that Pungsan chairman's mistress
is out of the picture now.

231
00:17:09,153 --> 00:17:12,614
His wife found out that he's actually
in love with the mistress,

232
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:14,033
so she cooked up a ruse.

233
00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:15,492
What kind of ruse?

234
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:20,080
She hired a young, pretty girl
as his maid.

235
00:17:20,581 --> 00:17:21,832
What? Why?

236
00:17:21,957 --> 00:17:25,586
Because she'd rather deal with him lost
in lust than in love with his mistress.

237
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:29,798
And apparently,
she told that maid all the details

238
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:32,301
about Bok-ja Park's death.

239
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:05,959
What's my husband doing now?

240
00:18:07,002 --> 00:18:10,047
He's fighting with his girlfriend.
He actually just left after the fight.

241
00:18:11,006 --> 00:18:13,967
I see.
It's about time they start fighting.

242
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:16,845
He'll probably get himself
a new girlfriend soon.

243
00:18:17,846 --> 00:18:19,807
-Ms. Kim.
-Yes?

244
00:18:20,849 --> 00:18:22,518
Would you like to watch
a movie with me today?

245
00:18:23,227 --> 00:18:24,478
I'm off today.

246
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:27,481
A movie?

247
00:18:28,232 --> 00:18:31,568
Yes, I want to know
what kind of movies you like.

248
00:18:32,861 --> 00:18:33,904
I like movies.

249
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:36,532
I like movies too.

250
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:37,991
Then, let's go to the movies.

251
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:40,869
Are you asking me out on a date?

252
00:18:42,496 --> 00:18:43,747
I guess so.

253
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:46,667
I don't do those things.

254
00:18:47,709 --> 00:18:48,919
Let's just...

255
00:18:50,587 --> 00:18:51,922
How about we...

256
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:54,383
Let's just have fun.

257
00:18:59,096 --> 00:19:00,764
I'll take a shower first.

258
00:19:11,191 --> 00:19:13,527
Hello, ma'am.
Can I help you find something?

259
00:19:14,278 --> 00:19:16,280
Come this way.
The latest collection is over there.

260
00:19:17,364 --> 00:19:18,532
Thank you very much.

261
00:19:26,582 --> 00:19:28,417
Isn't this cute?
I think this one is cuter.

262
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,334
It's so adorable.

263
00:19:29,877 --> 00:19:31,003
We'll get this one and...

264
00:19:34,756 --> 00:19:37,342
There's a heart here.
That's what I love the most.

265
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:38,510
Look at this flower here.

266
00:19:41,221 --> 00:19:42,347
I love this heart.

267
00:19:49,479 --> 00:19:50,606
What's the title?

268
00:19:50,898 --> 00:19:52,149
Curtain Call.

269
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:54,818
-Curtain Call?
-Yes.

270
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:57,946
As you know, "curtain call" refers to
performers appearing on stage again

271
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:01,074
in response to the audience's applause
after their performance.

272
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:03,535
Is that how you interpreted
the notion of death?

273
00:20:05,412 --> 00:20:07,789
My gosh, Seong-hui Yun.

274
00:20:07,998 --> 00:20:09,499
You're very talented.

275
00:20:10,417 --> 00:20:13,295
-Just be careful with guys from now on.
-Okay.

276
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:15,505
How did you come up with this idea?

277
00:20:17,132 --> 00:20:20,844
Ms. Kim, we have to prepare
the caption for this painting,

278
00:20:20,928 --> 00:20:23,430
-so take notes of what she tells you.
-No problem.

279
00:20:24,097 --> 00:20:27,809
Oh, right. Have you sent the payment
for her painting that we sold?

280
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:28,727
Yes, I have.

281
00:20:29,811 --> 00:20:31,563
A-jin gave me the go-ahead
to send your payment.

282
00:20:33,523 --> 00:20:36,443
That's how the curtain was rung down
on my stage called life.

283
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:41,073
My life, which received no applause,

284
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:42,950
ended like this.

285
00:20:45,494 --> 00:20:47,454
What made her happy

286
00:20:47,829 --> 00:20:50,207
was neither fancy purses
nor expensive shoes.

287
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:53,919
However, she was embarking
on a new chapter of her life

288
00:20:54,002 --> 00:20:57,089
and she decided to be her own cheerleader

289
00:20:57,172 --> 00:20:58,465
in her new journey.

290
00:21:04,513 --> 00:21:07,641
Then, there are people who show us
that even the glass ceiling

291
00:21:08,183 --> 00:21:10,018
and the glass floor can be broken.

292
00:21:10,978 --> 00:21:12,312
All right, it looks good.

293
00:21:13,063 --> 00:21:14,564
Here you go.

294
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:16,275
That seals the deal.

295
00:21:16,358 --> 00:21:17,401
BUILDING PURCHASE AGREEMENT

296
00:21:17,484 --> 00:21:20,070
Just like that,
she has broken the glass ceiling

297
00:21:20,153 --> 00:21:23,073
-Congratulations.
-and she keeps on moving up in the world.

298
00:21:31,832 --> 00:21:34,126
The magic wand that enabled her
to break the glass ceiling

299
00:21:34,501 --> 00:21:36,878
and climb the social ladder.

300
00:21:43,885 --> 00:21:46,596
Surprisingly enough, her magic wand was

301
00:21:47,222 --> 00:21:50,142
the flavor enhancer that everyone knows.

302
00:22:00,068 --> 00:22:01,778
Do you have any radish kimchi?

303
00:22:02,029 --> 00:22:03,572
Just eat it, will you?

304
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:14,291
Eat it with that.

305
00:22:23,842 --> 00:22:25,385
The kimchi is ripe and delicious.

306
00:22:25,802 --> 00:22:29,097
You think it's delicious?
It tastes like it has a ton of MSG.

307
00:22:36,438 --> 00:22:37,314
Dad.

308
00:22:38,648 --> 00:22:42,778
We hired a lawyer at the best law firm
in the country for Jae-gu.

309
00:22:46,865 --> 00:22:49,076
By the way, where's Ju-mi?
I also haven't seen Un-gyu.

310
00:22:49,409 --> 00:22:52,746
Ju-mi went to work
and Un-gyu is abroad now to study English.

311
00:22:53,371 --> 00:22:54,498
He left a while ago.

312
00:22:57,542 --> 00:22:59,127
Dad, you should eat more.

313
00:22:59,753 --> 00:23:02,089
It's okay. I don't have much appetite.

314
00:23:10,597 --> 00:23:11,556
By the way,

315
00:23:12,307 --> 00:23:15,769
we need to go through all the assets
she left behind and sort things out,

316
00:23:16,186 --> 00:23:18,772
but I just can't bring it up to Dad now.

317
00:23:18,855 --> 00:23:21,358
Is money the only thing you care about?
We have to help Jae-gu first.

318
00:23:22,317 --> 00:23:24,736
Hey, that woman is dead,

319
00:23:25,112 --> 00:23:27,614
so we won't need to start a lawsuit
to get the shares back, right?

320
00:23:27,989 --> 00:23:28,907
I have no idea.

321
00:23:29,366 --> 00:23:32,577
Hey, you can't be that hands-off about it.

322
00:23:32,661 --> 00:23:33,954
You're jobless now.

323
00:23:35,122 --> 00:23:37,499
We should settle the dispute
over the assets once and for all.

324
00:23:37,582 --> 00:23:39,334
Gosh, seriously. Enough, okay?

325
00:23:40,043 --> 00:23:42,254
-How can you be going on about that now?
-What's your problem?

326
00:23:43,505 --> 00:23:46,049
Legally, half of the money she left behind

327
00:23:46,299 --> 00:23:49,761
should go to Dad because he's her spouse
and the rest is ours.

328
00:23:50,011 --> 00:23:51,930
We should take this as an opportunity
to sort that out.

329
00:23:52,013 --> 00:23:53,306
Goodness.

330
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:56,268
By the way,

331
00:23:57,894 --> 00:23:59,729
don't you think Dad looks
so much healthier now?

332
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:02,899
That woman did help him a lot.

333
00:24:25,463 --> 00:24:26,548
What's going on with Mr. Oh?

334
00:24:27,382 --> 00:24:29,926
I heard that he decided to stay
at Gangil Group.

335
00:24:31,511 --> 00:24:32,596
I see.

336
00:24:34,097 --> 00:24:34,973
Sir.

337
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:40,103
I actually got a call from Mr. Jae-gu Ahn

338
00:24:40,437 --> 00:24:42,355
a few days before Ms. Park passed away.

339
00:24:42,647 --> 00:24:43,565
What did he say?

340
00:24:44,107 --> 00:24:47,986
He told me that Mr. Oh has been
Ms. Park's right-hand man

341
00:24:48,695 --> 00:24:51,072
and that I should tell you
not to trust him.

342
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:54,159
He asked me to make sure
I pass the message along to you.

343
00:24:54,451 --> 00:24:56,036
Wasn't it you?

344
00:24:57,287 --> 00:24:59,080
I thought it was you.

345
00:24:59,748 --> 00:25:01,958
Does that mean you knew everything?

346
00:25:02,042 --> 00:25:04,878
Of course. How could I not have known?

347
00:25:05,921 --> 00:25:08,590
Then why did you do those things?

348
00:25:08,965 --> 00:25:12,177
There are things that
you just can't pull yourself away from.

349
00:25:14,262 --> 00:25:15,513
I...

350
00:25:17,557 --> 00:25:20,644
I liked her a lot.

351
00:25:41,623 --> 00:25:43,792
Is there anything you want to say to me?

352
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:51,633
Dad.

353
00:25:53,301 --> 00:25:54,177
Yes.

354
00:25:55,595 --> 00:25:58,723
Please take good care
of Un-gyu and my wife for me.

355
00:26:03,561 --> 00:26:05,021
I don't resent you.

356
00:26:14,406 --> 00:26:15,323
I'm sorry.

357
00:26:18,201 --> 00:26:20,036
I'll do everything in my power

358
00:26:21,371 --> 00:26:22,914
to help you.

359
00:26:26,167 --> 00:26:27,836
Please take care of your health.

360
00:26:57,741 --> 00:26:59,951
REAL ESTATE TITLE RECORDS

361
00:27:00,035 --> 00:27:02,412
OWNER: A-JIN WOO
105 UN TOP VILLAGE, UNIT 303

362
00:27:02,495 --> 00:27:04,664
I transferred it back to your name.

363
00:27:07,751 --> 00:27:11,546
Let's end the litigations
and our dispute over the assets here.

364
00:27:12,005 --> 00:27:13,548
-A-jin.
-Yes?

365
00:27:14,174 --> 00:27:15,383
Don't you pity me?

366
00:27:15,592 --> 00:27:16,801
Why should I pity you?

367
00:27:17,177 --> 00:27:20,013
My wife left me and I even lost my job.

368
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:22,724
And to top it all off,
my brother is in jail for murder.

369
00:27:23,391 --> 00:27:26,353
Do you know what your biggest problem is?

370
00:27:28,021 --> 00:27:30,690
You think that
the world revolves around you.

371
00:27:31,191 --> 00:27:32,567
You're right. I am like that.

372
00:27:33,109 --> 00:27:36,154
Even though I'm self-centered,

373
00:27:36,363 --> 00:27:37,655
I'm very modest.

374
00:27:37,781 --> 00:27:41,242
As an example, I think of myself
as the earth and you as the sun.

375
00:27:41,659 --> 00:27:44,079
Right, and that woman is the moon.

376
00:27:45,288 --> 00:27:46,581
You're right. I did think like that.

377
00:27:47,832 --> 00:27:49,793
What would be the best way
to make you understand it?

378
00:27:50,251 --> 00:27:51,503
Yes, that will be the quickest.

379
00:27:52,545 --> 00:27:55,632
From now on, you should think of yourself
as the sun,

380
00:27:55,799 --> 00:27:57,008
not the earth.

381
00:27:57,884 --> 00:28:00,553
Try to think that you exist for the earth.

382
00:28:01,429 --> 00:28:05,475
I hope you realize that not everything
in the universe exists for you.

383
00:28:06,309 --> 00:28:08,228
Ji-hu must take after you.

384
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:10,814
I can never understand
what the two of you say.

385
00:28:11,231 --> 00:28:13,650
Well, that's also the reason why
I love the two of you so much.

386
00:28:14,401 --> 00:28:17,362
You certainly don't need
anyone's pity. Why?

387
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:20,240
Because you're the sun.

388
00:28:27,956 --> 00:28:30,125
Ji-hu said she wants to hang out with you.

389
00:28:35,171 --> 00:28:36,965
Right.

390
00:28:37,882 --> 00:28:40,427
After all, tomorrow is another day.

391
00:28:44,806 --> 00:28:47,684
Ji-hu, Daddy has a lot of time today.
Where shall we go?

392
00:28:47,976 --> 00:28:49,310
I don't have much time today.

393
00:28:50,019 --> 00:28:51,020
Really?

394
00:28:52,564 --> 00:28:54,774
Did you and Mom sort everything out
without fighting?

395
00:28:54,899 --> 00:28:55,734
Yes, we did.

396
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:59,446
Dad, shall we go somewhere
and grab a bite to eat?

397
00:28:59,821 --> 00:29:00,655
Sure!

398
00:29:06,911 --> 00:29:07,746
Dad.

399
00:29:08,455 --> 00:29:11,249
You have to pull yourself together, okay?

400
00:29:11,708 --> 00:29:12,667
What do you mean?

401
00:29:12,876 --> 00:29:15,795
I'm worried about you because
you're not a mentally strong person.

402
00:29:15,879 --> 00:29:18,548
I'm not mentally weak.
What are you talking about?

403
00:29:18,923 --> 00:29:21,384
If Mom starts seeing another man...

404
00:29:21,634 --> 00:29:22,552
I can't allow that.

405
00:29:22,927 --> 00:29:26,181
Why can't you? I mean, you did it.
Why can't Mom do it?

406
00:29:26,264 --> 00:29:27,474
She can't. She absolutely can't.

407
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:31,811
Dad, you can no longer
meddle in Mom's life.

408
00:29:34,856 --> 00:29:36,691
Dad, have you watched The Lion King?

409
00:29:37,859 --> 00:29:39,694
Of course.
It's the animation with the lion.

410
00:29:40,028 --> 00:29:42,614
That's right. There's something
the Lion King says in it.

411
00:29:42,906 --> 00:29:46,201
"The past can hurt. But from the way
I see it, you can either

412
00:29:46,284 --> 00:29:47,619
run from it or learn from it."

413
00:29:48,203 --> 00:29:51,206
I really hope that you can learn
from your past mistakes so that you can...

414
00:29:51,748 --> 00:29:53,708
I hope you can learn
what's right and wrong.

415
00:29:55,043 --> 00:29:56,920
You don't want a lion
to outsmart you, do you?

416
00:30:09,432 --> 00:30:10,308
Hey.

417
00:30:12,852 --> 00:30:14,562
Hey. Have you eaten yet?

418
00:30:14,771 --> 00:30:16,439
No, not yet. What about you?

419
00:30:16,689 --> 00:30:19,818
Well, you know what my answer will be.
Let's go.

420
00:30:20,318 --> 00:30:21,861
Let me introduce you to Ms. Seo
before we go.

421
00:30:21,945 --> 00:30:25,698
I've already introduced myself to her.
I also gave out my business cards.

422
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:27,700
Everything has been taken care of.

423
00:30:30,954 --> 00:30:33,706
I have a meeting in 20 minutes.
It won't take long though.

424
00:30:33,957 --> 00:30:35,500
All right, I'll be looking
at paintings here.

425
00:30:35,959 --> 00:30:37,752
Don't worry. Just go and have a fun date.

426
00:30:37,836 --> 00:30:39,921
I'm supposed to meet
Pungsan Technology chairman's wife.

427
00:30:40,004 --> 00:30:42,715
She's going to hang out with me all day.

428
00:30:43,049 --> 00:30:46,344
I have to take her somewhere,
so you can definitely step out.

429
00:30:47,136 --> 00:30:51,432
Thank you for being so considerate.
We'll get going, then. Let's go.

430
00:31:03,778 --> 00:31:07,073
The restaurant we're going to
is over there.

431
00:31:07,615 --> 00:31:10,285
It's 200m away from here.

432
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:11,703
Right.

433
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:15,957
Since our step lengths are different,
we have to stay focused

434
00:31:16,541 --> 00:31:18,209
in order to keep our pace the same

435
00:31:18,459 --> 00:31:20,712
so that we can walk side by side
until we get to the restaurant.

436
00:31:21,671 --> 00:31:23,381
What are you trying to say?

437
00:31:30,471 --> 00:31:32,849
If we do this, we'll be able to relax

438
00:31:33,474 --> 00:31:35,935
and enjoy our walk all the way there.

439
00:32:02,837 --> 00:32:05,131
What... What will happen to my husband?

440
00:32:05,423 --> 00:32:06,424
Bok-ja Park!

441
00:32:08,009 --> 00:32:09,010
Bok-ja Park?

442
00:32:09,636 --> 00:32:12,764
That new maid.
She's possessed by Bok-ja Park.

443
00:32:13,723 --> 00:32:16,851
Are you saying Bok-ja Park's spirit
is inside her body now?

444
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:18,853
Why did you hire a girl like her
as a maid?

445
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:22,607
What should I do now?

446
00:32:23,232 --> 00:32:26,194
Just fire her. What else can you do?

447
00:32:26,277 --> 00:32:29,364
It's too late. I told you that
she's possessed by that woman's spirit.

448
00:32:30,615 --> 00:32:31,950
What about my husband?

449
00:32:33,493 --> 00:32:36,162
Well, let me be clear on this.

450
00:32:37,538 --> 00:32:41,501
I never went into anyone's body.

451
00:32:42,001 --> 00:32:44,212
I can tell you for certain

452
00:32:44,963 --> 00:32:47,382
that I'm not in their world.

453
00:32:53,763 --> 00:32:54,681
God.

454
00:32:54,847 --> 00:32:56,182
The case has been solved.

455
00:32:56,432 --> 00:32:57,308
Hey.

456
00:32:58,977 --> 00:33:01,521
You said that Jae-gu Ahn has a son, right?

457
00:33:01,896 --> 00:33:03,898
-Yes.
-How old is his son?

458
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:06,192
He's studying English in the US
after his college entrance exam.

459
00:33:08,736 --> 00:33:09,612
Jeez.

460
00:33:10,071 --> 00:33:11,489
It must be a big shock to him.

461
00:33:13,491 --> 00:33:16,452
-Sweet dreams, Mom.
-You too, my princess.

462
00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:29,132
"It was really delicious."

463
00:33:31,175 --> 00:33:33,970
February 28, Tuesday.

464
00:33:34,804 --> 00:33:38,224
My cousin called me late at night
when I was asleep.

465
00:33:38,808 --> 00:33:41,352
I missed the call, so I called him back.

466
00:33:41,853 --> 00:33:45,231
He said, "I'll kill the devil tonight."

467
00:33:46,024 --> 00:33:49,986
I suppose,
after he finished the entrance exam,

468
00:33:50,153 --> 00:33:53,239
he must've been indulging himself
in playing games.

469
00:33:54,449 --> 00:33:57,285
His mission seems to be killing the devil,

470
00:33:57,618 --> 00:33:59,871
which must be the goal

471
00:34:00,288 --> 00:34:03,499
or the character of the game
he's been playing.

472
00:34:03,791 --> 00:34:05,460
February 28...

473
00:34:07,336 --> 00:34:09,130
That's after he left for the States.

474
00:34:12,133 --> 00:34:14,427
So, do you know
if Un-gyu managed to beat the devil?

475
00:34:14,802 --> 00:34:15,803
What are you talking about?

476
00:34:17,805 --> 00:34:21,642
Sorry, I read what you wrote
in your English journal.

477
00:34:22,101 --> 00:34:24,062
I wanted to make sure
you're mentally healthy and happy.

478
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:28,232
It's not an invasion of privacy, right?
Don't get mad at me.

479
00:34:28,524 --> 00:34:31,778
It's fine. I left it on my desk
because I don't mind you reading it.

480
00:34:31,861 --> 00:34:35,656
Right? It looks like you and Un-gyu
talk often. I'm glad you two are close.

481
00:34:35,865 --> 00:34:38,284
-We talk from time to time.
-Is he doing well in the States?

482
00:34:39,035 --> 00:34:40,620
Is he in the States now?

483
00:34:40,745 --> 00:34:43,122
Yes, he's studying English there now.

484
00:34:43,289 --> 00:34:44,957
No, he didn't go to the States.

485
00:34:45,875 --> 00:34:46,959
What do you mean?

486
00:34:47,043 --> 00:34:48,836
He was in Korea when I last spoke to him.

487
00:34:50,171 --> 00:34:51,005
What?

488
00:34:52,507 --> 00:34:55,134
UN-GYU

489
00:35:08,272 --> 00:35:10,316
-Hello?
-Hey.

490
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:13,653
Un-gyu, why did you call me this late?

491
00:35:14,112 --> 00:35:16,906
I'll kill the devil tonight.

492
00:35:17,532 --> 00:35:18,366
The devil?

493
00:35:20,409 --> 00:35:21,744
It's raining, which is great.

494
00:35:23,788 --> 00:35:25,540
It's the perfect night to kill the devil.

495
00:35:26,374 --> 00:35:29,127
Un-gyu, did you call me to tell me this?

496
00:35:30,044 --> 00:35:31,796
I called because at least one person
needs to know.

497
00:35:32,338 --> 00:35:34,048
Are you home now, Un-gyu?

498
00:35:34,590 --> 00:35:35,424
Yes.

499
00:35:36,134 --> 00:35:38,928
Don't get too addicted to games, okay?

500
00:35:47,145 --> 00:35:48,855
-Have a good day.
-See you later.

501
00:35:48,938 --> 00:35:49,856
Bye.

502
00:36:10,793 --> 00:36:13,254
He said... out of the blue, Un-gyu said,

503
00:36:13,337 --> 00:36:16,424
"I'll kill the devil tonight."

504
00:36:16,966 --> 00:36:19,802
I thought that killing the devil
must be the goal of the game

505
00:36:19,886 --> 00:36:21,721
he has been playing.

506
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:26,684
Un-gyu!

507
00:36:28,394 --> 00:36:29,562
Aunt A-jin.

508
00:36:49,165 --> 00:36:49,999
You.

509
00:36:51,375 --> 00:36:52,418
Get out!

510
00:36:56,756 --> 00:36:58,216
You killed a man!

511
00:36:58,382 --> 00:37:00,760
I wasn't the one who killed him!

512
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:03,679
It was an accident!
How many times have I told you?

513
00:37:03,763 --> 00:37:06,724
-Shut up!
-You treat me like an insect!

514
00:37:07,808 --> 00:37:09,060
You son of a bitch!

515
00:37:09,769 --> 00:37:10,811
Mr. Chairman!

516
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:13,397
Your wife and kid.

517
00:37:14,649 --> 00:37:18,152
If you want them to be treated
like human beings in this household,

518
00:37:18,277 --> 00:37:21,781
you better keep your mouth shut.

519
00:37:22,156 --> 00:37:24,200
Are you crazy?

520
00:37:24,992 --> 00:37:27,411
If you spew that kind of bullshit
once more,

521
00:37:28,913 --> 00:37:31,916
your wife and son will get kicked out too.

522
00:37:33,834 --> 00:37:35,211
This is your last warning.

523
00:37:51,435 --> 00:37:53,104
He's mistaken.

524
00:37:53,562 --> 00:37:55,648
He took my blanket, so...

525
00:37:55,731 --> 00:37:57,817
So, that's why you were going to
sleep next to me?

526
00:37:58,025 --> 00:38:00,569
No. That wasn't it, my blanket...

527
00:38:01,153 --> 00:38:02,571
What do you think you are doing?

528
00:38:02,905 --> 00:38:05,574
I've already killed someone before.

529
00:38:05,825 --> 00:38:07,952
First time, it's hard.
The second time, not so much.

530
00:38:08,744 --> 00:38:09,745
Shoot.

531
00:38:10,579 --> 00:38:13,416
If you don't shoot me here,
you'll look ridiculous.

532
00:38:13,666 --> 00:38:16,502
Shoot me!

533
00:38:16,627 --> 00:38:19,880
-You can't do this.
-Let go!

534
00:38:19,964 --> 00:38:21,799
-You can't do this.
-What in the hell is going on?

535
00:38:34,812 --> 00:38:36,897
-Ju-mi.
-Don't.

536
00:38:39,191 --> 00:38:41,902
I'm sorry. I'll go back to America.

537
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:46,615
Don't go. Claim what belongs
to you and Un-gyu, first.

538
00:38:47,033 --> 00:38:49,285
You can't back down. We are

539
00:38:49,994 --> 00:38:51,412
on the edge of a cliff right now.

540
00:38:51,537 --> 00:38:52,997
It's all useless.

541
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:56,125
No, if you can't do that,
do something before you go.

542
00:38:57,501 --> 00:38:59,211
-Like what?
-At least...

543
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,465
kill that woman before you go.

544
00:39:49,011 --> 00:39:50,638
I'm sorry.

545
00:39:51,889 --> 00:39:53,682
I'm sorry, Un-gyu.

546
00:40:07,238 --> 00:40:08,364
Un-gyu.

547
00:40:10,699 --> 00:40:11,784
It's me, Dad.

548
00:40:12,451 --> 00:40:14,328
I heard you'll leave for the States
in two days.

549
00:40:14,870 --> 00:40:17,957
Come and see me before you leave.

550
00:40:20,668 --> 00:40:21,669
I miss you.

551
00:40:43,649 --> 00:40:44,984
You must've had booze before.

552
00:40:50,406 --> 00:40:52,825
I wanted to go to a sauna with you

553
00:40:54,493 --> 00:40:56,245
and I also wanted to help you

554
00:40:57,329 --> 00:40:58,998
the very first time you shaved,

555
00:41:00,207 --> 00:41:01,167
but I couldn't.

556
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:05,004
Here.

557
00:41:08,257 --> 00:41:10,259
I want to at least teach you how to drink.

558
00:41:11,427 --> 00:41:13,804
I should teach you so that you know
how to drink properly.

559
00:41:19,518 --> 00:41:20,811
Why didn't you come back sooner?

560
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:25,274
I'm sorry.

561
00:41:25,357 --> 00:41:26,692
Mom and I...

562
00:41:28,986 --> 00:41:30,321
We were very lonely.

563
00:41:34,408 --> 00:41:35,367
I'm sorry.

564
00:41:45,628 --> 00:41:46,462
I...

565
00:41:48,422 --> 00:41:49,632
I won't go to the States.

566
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:01,977
You dropped that knife at the scene.

567
00:42:04,647 --> 00:42:05,689
You didn't know, did you?

568
00:42:06,649 --> 00:42:07,566
What?

569
00:42:11,278 --> 00:42:12,613
You found this at the scene?

570
00:42:37,012 --> 00:42:37,930
Hey.

571
00:42:38,722 --> 00:42:41,559
Let's sleep at a bed-and-breakfast.
It's too cold out here.

572
00:42:41,684 --> 00:42:44,979
Let's try sleeping here first.
I've always wanted to do this.

573
00:42:57,324 --> 00:42:59,535
Inmate number 8516, you have a visitor.

574
00:43:17,595 --> 00:43:19,471
You should move to the States with Un-gyu.

575
00:43:21,098 --> 00:43:23,392
Ohio is a great place to live.

576
00:43:25,102 --> 00:43:26,478
He can go to university there too.

577
00:43:27,563 --> 00:43:30,566
But I guess that means
you'll have to quit your job here.

578
00:43:34,403 --> 00:43:35,738
I'll wait.

579
00:43:37,823 --> 00:43:39,491
We'll wait for you there.

580
00:43:44,288 --> 00:43:45,289
Thank you.

581
00:43:47,416 --> 00:43:48,292
And...

582
00:43:49,918 --> 00:43:50,753
I'm sorry.

583
00:43:54,673 --> 00:43:56,050
Gosh...

584
00:43:58,177 --> 00:43:59,970
I feel a bit better now.

585
00:44:01,639 --> 00:44:02,681
I've always

586
00:44:04,933 --> 00:44:06,894
felt bad because I've done nothing

587
00:44:08,979 --> 00:44:11,440
for you and Un-gyu.

588
00:44:27,456 --> 00:44:31,210
FEBRUARY 28, 1:40 A.M.

589
00:44:41,845 --> 00:44:43,430
Hello? Mr. Kim?

590
00:44:46,016 --> 00:44:47,434
I'm at the hospital now.

591
00:44:48,602 --> 00:44:49,520
Just go home.

592
00:45:43,532 --> 00:45:46,869
FEBRUARY 28, 1:42 A.M.

593
00:46:16,773 --> 00:46:17,649
Un-gyu.

594
00:46:18,150 --> 00:46:21,737
Why did you do that?
Why did you do that to me?

595
00:46:22,571 --> 00:46:24,490
Why did you treat my mom like that?

596
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:31,830
-I thought you were in the States...
-Why?

597
00:46:32,206 --> 00:46:34,666
I'm asking you
why you treated us like that!

598
00:47:30,389 --> 00:47:32,599
FIVE MONTHS AFTER BOK-JA PARK'S DEATH

599
00:47:37,312 --> 00:47:39,648
Yun-jae, you know

600
00:47:40,107 --> 00:47:42,401
that you have to call me every day
from the States, right?

601
00:47:42,651 --> 00:47:43,610
Yes.

602
00:47:46,113 --> 00:47:49,491
Don't eat too much chocolate and
don't forget to brush your teeth, okay?

603
00:47:49,616 --> 00:47:52,786
I love you, Son. Mom loves you so much.

604
00:48:05,340 --> 00:48:07,384
Call me when you arrive, okay?

605
00:48:07,467 --> 00:48:09,136
Make sure you call me
as soon as you arrive.

606
00:48:09,886 --> 00:48:11,346
Mom loves you.

607
00:48:14,099 --> 00:48:15,434
You have to call me!

608
00:48:16,977 --> 00:48:18,395
They weren't the only ones

609
00:48:19,563 --> 00:48:21,189
who were parting ways.

610
00:49:04,650 --> 00:49:07,986
It's too bad, but what can you do?
Just give up this time.

611
00:49:08,820 --> 00:49:11,615
Ms. Seo, that gallery is in New York.

612
00:49:12,407 --> 00:49:15,077
It's not in Seoul, so it shouldn't matter.

613
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:17,204
It's not like social media's reach
is limited to Seoul.

614
00:49:17,829 --> 00:49:20,207
Do you know how cutthroat
overseas Korean communities can be?

615
00:49:20,290 --> 00:49:23,669
Besides, those in Gangnam have
direct connections to Koreans in New York.

616
00:49:24,336 --> 00:49:27,047
Practically everybody knows that
you had a relationship with a married man.

617
00:49:27,756 --> 00:49:30,175
Your artistic career might end
if you aren't diplomatic this time.

618
00:49:30,258 --> 00:49:33,595
It's not fair. I feel so victimized.

619
00:49:33,887 --> 00:49:35,347
What is unfair?

620
00:49:36,932 --> 00:49:40,602
Everyone must pay for what they did.

621
00:49:40,686 --> 00:49:43,939
I've already paid for the mistake I made.

622
00:49:44,022 --> 00:49:45,315
How did you pay for it?

623
00:49:45,857 --> 00:49:48,652
Ms. Woo took all of my paintings.

624
00:49:48,944 --> 00:49:51,571
That's a deal you made with A-jin.

625
00:49:52,030 --> 00:49:54,324
The world hasn't punished you for it yet.

626
00:49:55,575 --> 00:49:57,619
It looks like you still have no idea
how this world works.

627
00:49:57,703 --> 00:50:00,247
The show in New York
isn't even important now.

628
00:50:01,373 --> 00:50:04,668
Hey, you should change your name too.

629
00:50:04,835 --> 00:50:06,294
Oh, I guess you can't do that.

630
00:50:06,378 --> 00:50:08,714
Your name is already registered
in the association.

631
00:50:11,133 --> 00:50:13,093
You should just never
show your face in public.

632
00:50:13,427 --> 00:50:15,721
No publicity activities for you
whatsoever.

633
00:50:15,804 --> 00:50:17,639
Just paint and do nothing else.

634
00:50:20,392 --> 00:50:21,309
Do you want fame?

635
00:50:21,393 --> 00:50:24,563
If you get a taste of it, you'll realize
that it's not that big of a deal.

636
00:50:28,442 --> 00:50:30,360
That son of a bitch.

637
00:50:41,913 --> 00:50:43,123
Hurry up, guys!

638
00:50:51,757 --> 00:50:54,217
Let's eat a ton of sashimi here.

639
00:50:57,596 --> 00:51:01,308
When he saw the woman holding a knife,

640
00:51:01,683 --> 00:51:04,811
he felt that fate must be
working its magic in inexplicable ways.

641
00:51:07,189 --> 00:51:11,193
He also thought that she may be
happy to become the earth for him.

642
00:51:12,319 --> 00:51:14,321
He obviously had no interest

643
00:51:14,571 --> 00:51:18,200
in learning from his past mistakes.

644
00:51:21,036 --> 00:51:23,163
We'd like to offer you
the position of executive director

645
00:51:23,622 --> 00:51:25,582
of our design team.

646
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:28,418
As for your salary, we'll match

647
00:51:28,543 --> 00:51:31,213
what the top-notch designers are making
and you'll also get a bonus.

648
00:51:32,589 --> 00:51:34,257
Thank you very much for the offer.

649
00:51:35,217 --> 00:51:37,594
But at the moment,
I'd like to focus on growing my brand

650
00:51:37,677 --> 00:51:39,721
on my own.

651
00:51:40,722 --> 00:51:44,851
It'll be great if our brands can
work together strategically going forward.

652
00:51:46,895 --> 00:51:48,438
What do you think about my proposal?

653
00:51:51,191 --> 00:51:54,361
I think your brand will soon become
our biggest competition.

654
00:51:55,821 --> 00:51:56,988
I wish you all the best.

655
00:51:58,156 --> 00:52:00,909
She started afresh in every aspect.

656
00:52:02,077 --> 00:52:04,621
The comfort which the heater
and sunroof once gave her.

657
00:52:05,747 --> 00:52:08,166
By giving it up,

658
00:52:08,708 --> 00:52:11,086
she gained true freedom.

659
00:52:12,671 --> 00:52:16,842
Not everyone can enjoy such freedom.

660
00:52:18,009 --> 00:52:19,302
The breeze feels nice.

661
00:52:22,430 --> 00:52:23,682
Perhaps it was

662
00:52:24,850 --> 00:52:27,018
her privilege.

663
00:52:31,147 --> 00:52:34,067
I'll go pick up some coffee for us
and juice for the kids.

664
00:52:37,070 --> 00:52:39,698
Ms. Baek, I'm so happy these days.

665
00:52:40,866 --> 00:52:41,950
You look happy.

666
00:52:42,367 --> 00:52:44,327
Every day is so precious.

667
00:52:45,078 --> 00:52:46,288
I can tell.

668
00:52:47,956 --> 00:52:50,750
There are so many unfortunate people
who feel that the morning sun

669
00:52:50,834 --> 00:52:52,878
is nothing but a nuisance
that wakes them up.

670
00:52:54,170 --> 00:52:57,048
Happiness is like the sunlight.

671
00:52:57,966 --> 00:53:01,344
You can't help but be grateful
if you think that it brings a new morning.

672
00:53:02,345 --> 00:53:05,098
From now on, I'll just enjoy everything

673
00:53:05,181 --> 00:53:06,933
that the world has given me for free.

674
00:53:07,726 --> 00:53:09,436
Word. How wise.

675
00:53:09,519 --> 00:53:11,021
I want to write it down somewhere.

676
00:53:12,397 --> 00:53:15,066
All right, kids. In-jae, this is yours.

677
00:53:15,150 --> 00:53:16,401
Thank you.

678
00:53:16,943 --> 00:53:18,194
This is yours, Ji-hu.

679
00:53:18,403 --> 00:53:19,738
Thank you.

680
00:53:20,071 --> 00:53:22,824
It's nice to meet you. I'm Gi-ho Kang.

681
00:53:22,908 --> 00:53:24,284
I'm Ji-hu Ahn.

682
00:53:24,659 --> 00:53:25,869
I've heard so much about you.

683
00:53:25,994 --> 00:53:28,038
Mr. Kang, you're Mom's partner, right?

684
00:53:28,371 --> 00:53:30,165
Yes, I'm your mom's partner.

685
00:53:30,457 --> 00:53:32,709
You know that
partners must get along, right?

686
00:53:33,084 --> 00:53:35,295
Yes, I do. Help me out, okay?

687
00:53:35,795 --> 00:53:37,339
Okay, I will.

688
00:53:38,340 --> 00:53:42,135
My gosh. I must say,
you look so much like your mom.

689
00:53:43,428 --> 00:53:44,429
Mr. Kang.

690
00:53:45,013 --> 00:53:47,807
Do you know
what my mom's favorite food is?

691
00:53:50,685 --> 00:53:51,895
It's kimchi stew.

692
00:53:54,981 --> 00:53:57,400
You'll need my number.
You asked me for help.

693
00:53:58,360 --> 00:53:59,402
Right.

694
00:54:00,362 --> 00:54:01,196
Here.

695
00:54:07,619 --> 00:54:10,413
My parents' marriage ended like that,

696
00:54:10,622 --> 00:54:12,666
but I still love my dad very much.

697
00:54:13,166 --> 00:54:15,210
If you can be understanding about that,

698
00:54:15,377 --> 00:54:17,337
I'd like to open up to you
and get along with you.

699
00:54:17,420 --> 00:54:19,297
Of course. I definitely understand.

700
00:54:20,548 --> 00:54:24,386
You'll be understanding about me
wanting to be close with your mom, right?

701
00:54:24,719 --> 00:54:27,055
Yes. I'm relieved now that
I've met you in person.

702
00:54:27,681 --> 00:54:30,016
Really? Am I all right?

703
00:54:30,517 --> 00:54:33,144
Yes, you have kind eyes.

704
00:54:33,645 --> 00:54:35,105
Seriously? Wow.

705
00:54:36,272 --> 00:54:38,483
Ji-hu, you're definitely

706
00:54:39,109 --> 00:54:42,195
the most awesome 11-year-old kid
I've ever met. I mean it.

707
00:54:42,821 --> 00:54:45,323
Thank you. What a thoughtful compliment.

708
00:54:45,573 --> 00:54:48,201
That made my day.
This juice is delicious too.

709
00:54:48,493 --> 00:54:49,369
Is it?

710
00:54:52,372 --> 00:54:53,957
You should go to Mom.

711
00:54:54,207 --> 00:54:55,083
All right.

712
00:55:44,215 --> 00:55:46,426
GANGNAM POLICE STATION
CASE REPORT

713
00:55:46,509 --> 00:55:47,427
THE KNIFE USED IN THE CASE

714
00:55:49,888 --> 00:55:51,765
About their son, Un-gyu Ahn...

715
00:55:52,223 --> 00:55:55,060
I asked those at the Immigration Service,
but he actually never left the country.

716
00:55:59,147 --> 00:56:01,274
SUSPECT: JAE-GU AHN
TURNED HIMSELF IN

717
00:56:03,985 --> 00:56:06,780
VICTIM:JI-YEONG PARK
MURDERED

718
00:56:54,786 --> 00:56:57,372
What's the name of the guest in the suite?

719
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:00,291
It's Ms. A-jin Woo.

720
00:57:01,417 --> 00:57:02,752
A-jin Woo. Thank you.

721
00:57:06,005 --> 00:57:07,048
Oh, hello.

722
00:57:07,966 --> 00:57:10,051
I managed to get
the wine stain off, ma'am.

723
00:57:10,135 --> 00:57:12,178
I see. Thank you.

724
00:57:17,934 --> 00:57:19,018
Ms. Park.

725
00:57:19,853 --> 00:57:20,687
Yes.

726
00:57:28,528 --> 00:57:30,864
Thank you so much
for washing my clothes perfectly.

727
00:57:31,156 --> 00:57:33,199
May happiness surround you always,
wherever you go.

728
00:57:59,559 --> 00:58:01,853
Everyone dreams of being happy.

729
00:58:02,437 --> 00:58:04,898
We all desire things that we don't have.

730
00:58:05,815 --> 00:58:07,901
We think that having those things
will make us happy.

731
00:58:09,027 --> 00:58:12,822
However, happiness can
only make our lives more abundant

732
00:58:13,281 --> 00:58:16,201
when we free ourselves from such desires.

733
00:58:17,243 --> 00:58:19,662
I'm happy now.

734
00:58:20,747 --> 00:58:23,333
I'm happy now.

735
00:59:41,035 --> 00:59:42,120
THE END

736
00:59:42,203 --> 00:59:44,205
