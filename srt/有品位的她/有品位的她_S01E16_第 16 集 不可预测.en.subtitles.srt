1
00:00:40,957 --> 00:00:44,919
I am building a second house in Gwacheon,

2
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:47,797
so I want to change the art
and paintings into something fresh.

3
00:00:47,964 --> 00:00:49,841
This is my home.

4
00:00:50,425 --> 00:00:52,010
You should know what style I prefer.

5
00:00:53,344 --> 00:00:56,473
Since this is your second house,
I suggest a cozy atmosphere.

6
00:00:58,266 --> 00:00:59,100
For example,

7
00:00:59,184 --> 00:01:01,811
we can make this wall a plastered wall
with a watercolor painting,

8
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:03,688
and we can hang an oil painting here.

9
00:01:06,566 --> 00:01:08,943
I heard that you not only do

10
00:01:09,027 --> 00:01:10,904
house styling consultation,

11
00:01:10,987 --> 00:01:13,782
but also personal styling consultation.

12
00:01:19,496 --> 00:01:21,873
You are pretty famous in this line of work

13
00:01:21,998 --> 00:01:25,210
since Ms. Morinake is a person
who gives adequate reviews

14
00:01:25,293 --> 00:01:26,836
to things she's impressed in.

15
00:01:27,045 --> 00:01:29,756
You are also liked
among the women in Gangnam.

16
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:33,259
I want you to make a bag for me.
A clutch and a Boston bag.

17
00:01:33,802 --> 00:01:34,636
Okay.

18
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:36,846
I know your style better than anyone else.

19
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:39,808
I will design a one-and-only handbag

20
00:01:39,891 --> 00:01:42,060
with your name, Jin-kyung Seo on it.

21
00:01:43,645 --> 00:01:45,522
A one-and-only handbag?

22
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:47,690
Yes. You can count on it.

23
00:01:48,066 --> 00:01:49,067
Okay.

24
00:01:50,235 --> 00:01:52,362
When did you prepare all that?

25
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:57,492
Right. Clothes, bags and shoes.

26
00:01:57,617 --> 00:01:59,369
You made them yourself, didn't you?

27
00:02:00,995 --> 00:02:01,913
By the way,

28
00:02:02,413 --> 00:02:03,832
is your father-in-law awake yet?

29
00:02:06,626 --> 00:02:07,627
Father.

30
00:02:11,214 --> 00:02:12,090
Bok-ja Park.

31
00:02:13,383 --> 00:02:15,385
Where is she now?

32
00:02:20,306 --> 00:02:21,224
Get her for me.

33
00:02:21,474 --> 00:02:24,853
Does she know that I passed out?

34
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,354
Yes.

35
00:02:27,856 --> 00:02:29,482
But I don't think she's coming.

36
00:02:29,607 --> 00:02:31,401
I need an explanation.

37
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:33,570
Please get her for me.

38
00:02:33,778 --> 00:02:34,654
Father.

39
00:02:36,072 --> 00:02:38,158
I divorced Jae-seok.

40
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:43,246
I'm not in the position
to meddle in your business.

41
00:02:43,538 --> 00:02:47,375
I have no one else to trust but you.

42
00:02:50,628 --> 00:02:52,755
I wanted to believe
that her love was true.

43
00:02:53,423 --> 00:02:56,718
So, I gave all my shares to her.

44
00:02:57,635 --> 00:02:58,928
I thought...

45
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:01,431
maybe she really liked me.

46
00:03:08,563 --> 00:03:11,482
I'm not going to wake up.

47
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:16,738
Let's keep this as a secret between us.

48
00:03:23,119 --> 00:03:24,829
I'm sorry about Jae-seok.

49
00:03:25,747 --> 00:03:27,832
I didn't raise him right.

50
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:32,962
Is your father-in-law awake?

51
00:03:34,255 --> 00:03:36,549
No. He's not awake yet.

52
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:40,887
I see. Well, I guess
it's no longer your business

53
00:03:41,012 --> 00:03:42,180
since you're divorced.

54
00:03:49,354 --> 00:03:51,439
Hello, Hyo-ju.

55
00:03:52,398 --> 00:03:53,316
The hospital?

56
00:03:54,859 --> 00:03:56,069
Gi-ok.

57
00:03:58,112 --> 00:03:59,822
I am embarrassed.

58
00:04:00,281 --> 00:04:02,283
If a person is exposed to the world,

59
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:04,661
who wouldn't be embarrassed?

60
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:11,334
Gi-ok, are you okay?

61
00:04:12,335 --> 00:04:13,628
You must have been busy.

62
00:04:14,003 --> 00:04:15,171
Why did you come?

63
00:04:16,506 --> 00:04:17,632
-You're here.
-Yes.

64
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:19,175
Are you okay?

65
00:04:19,342 --> 00:04:21,010
Let's just talk about you today.

66
00:04:22,387 --> 00:04:24,222
Gi-ok, just lie down for a while.

67
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:27,225
Okay. I'll lie down. You two have fun.

68
00:04:28,977 --> 00:04:30,311
Don't leave me though.

69
00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:32,605
I am very lonely.

70
00:04:39,362 --> 00:04:42,073
I checked that yesterday.
Thank you, Hyo-ju.

71
00:04:42,407 --> 00:04:45,994
No problem. I will keep on advertising,

72
00:04:46,077 --> 00:04:48,121
so keep uploading the art

73
00:04:48,246 --> 00:04:49,956
consulting pictures
and designing products.

74
00:04:50,039 --> 00:04:54,544
No. Just advertise bags
and shoes on your blog.

75
00:04:54,669 --> 00:04:56,713
I think we should be focusing on a target.

76
00:04:57,255 --> 00:04:59,841
I am planning to launch my own brand.

77
00:05:01,217 --> 00:05:02,760
Do you want

78
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:05,638
a separate category just for yourself?

79
00:05:05,888 --> 00:05:07,098
Can you do that for me?

80
00:05:07,682 --> 00:05:09,642
If you can, I would be very thankful.

81
00:05:09,851 --> 00:05:12,270
I will give you sufficient commissions
from the profits.

82
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,565
You're great, A-jin.

83
00:05:16,065 --> 00:05:18,860
Ji-hu once told me

84
00:05:20,111 --> 00:05:22,196
that the clouds may hide the sun,

85
00:05:22,613 --> 00:05:24,282
but the sun is always shining.

86
00:05:26,075 --> 00:05:29,620
It seems that the clouds are very thick.

87
00:05:34,542 --> 00:05:36,878
What are you going to do
about your husband?

88
00:05:37,253 --> 00:05:38,463
I am divorced.

89
00:05:42,633 --> 00:05:44,177
I'm going to accept marriage and divorce

90
00:05:45,053 --> 00:05:47,513
as a part of life's process.

91
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:52,226
It made me think

92
00:05:53,686 --> 00:05:55,104
about my life and myself.

93
00:06:13,998 --> 00:06:16,876
Are you okay?

94
00:06:20,129 --> 00:06:22,173
You're here. Come and sit.

95
00:06:30,306 --> 00:06:31,641
How dare you come here.

96
00:06:34,143 --> 00:06:35,645
I came to apologize.

97
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:37,855
What? Apologize?

98
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:43,194
Sorry for seducing your husband.

99
00:06:50,618 --> 00:06:52,286
I didn't know it would come to this.

100
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:55,832
Please forgive me.

101
00:07:01,212 --> 00:07:02,213
I'm sorry.

102
00:07:14,725 --> 00:07:17,019
Is this brunch group about to be revived?

103
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:23,484
I'd say this is

104
00:07:23,734 --> 00:07:27,196
like a friendly gathering at the DMZ.

105
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:32,493
Gyeong-hui and I will always be enemies.

106
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:37,665
Be careful.

107
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:40,877
The early stages of pregnancy
is the most dangerous.

108
00:07:41,335 --> 00:07:42,420
No.

109
00:07:43,588 --> 00:07:44,589
What do you mean?

110
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:48,384
Neither my husband
nor Dr. Jang is the father.

111
00:08:01,814 --> 00:08:03,191
This is unbelievable.

112
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:08,321
How can a caregiver mess up
the whole family?

113
00:08:08,654 --> 00:08:10,114
It's all Jae-seok's fault.

114
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:12,992
He cheated on A-jin,

115
00:08:13,117 --> 00:08:15,244
making her care less
about family business.

116
00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:19,415
Honestly, she used to take care
of all family matters.

117
00:08:19,707 --> 00:08:23,127
Was Ju-mi so useless?

118
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:24,462
Ju-mi was nothing to Bok-ja.

119
00:08:24,712 --> 00:08:26,631
She ignored Ju-mi,

120
00:08:27,465 --> 00:08:29,884
but she listened to A-jin.

121
00:08:34,263 --> 00:08:36,682
Jae-gu. Let's get our company back!

122
00:08:37,642 --> 00:08:39,060
Let's get it back!

123
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:41,145
My goodness.

124
00:08:42,146 --> 00:08:44,315
Do you want your company back?

125
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:48,653
MIN-GI HAN, CEO OF MK CAPITAL

126
00:08:58,246 --> 00:08:59,956
How can you eat in this situation?

127
00:09:01,499 --> 00:09:02,542
Let's break up.

128
00:09:02,917 --> 00:09:06,170
I lost all my love for you in the court.

129
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:10,591
Hey!

130
00:09:11,467 --> 00:09:12,468
Gosh.

131
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:14,971
You shouldn't disturb someone
who's eating.

132
00:09:16,097 --> 00:09:17,265
Make up for my ruined life.

133
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:20,726
My life has been ruined after I met you.

134
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:23,688
You're the one to talk!
It's my life that has been ruined.

135
00:09:23,771 --> 00:09:25,147
You seduced me.

136
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:27,525
How can you seduce me when you're married?

137
00:09:27,608 --> 00:09:30,403
I can't believe this.
You're the one who seduced me.

138
00:09:30,528 --> 00:09:33,739
I divorced my wife because of you.

139
00:09:33,823 --> 00:09:36,617
Because of you,
I got my pictures taken away

140
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:38,035
and people know about what I did.

141
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:40,746
I haven't been this much humiliated
in my life.

142
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:43,457
Because of you, I lost my job

143
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:46,335
and I ended up like this.

144
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:49,922
Because of you, I am done,
screwed and destroyed.

145
00:09:50,006 --> 00:09:51,382
Because of you,

146
00:09:52,633 --> 00:09:54,719
I am neglected by everyone.

147
00:09:58,681 --> 00:10:01,517
I need a settlement. Give this house to me
and we'll call it even.

148
00:10:01,642 --> 00:10:03,185
Then, I'll leave you be.

149
00:10:07,064 --> 00:10:09,775
Where is the other page? Give it to me.

150
00:10:11,819 --> 00:10:12,945
Aren't you going to give it?

151
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:19,827
Hey! Didn't I tell you to stop this?

152
00:10:20,077 --> 00:10:22,121
Why should I listen to you?

153
00:10:22,204 --> 00:10:23,539
Why?

154
00:10:24,665 --> 00:10:25,958
I was out of my mind

155
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:28,336
to abandon my flower, A-jin

156
00:10:28,502 --> 00:10:29,837
for someone stupid like you.

157
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,673
-What?
-I'm not giving you that document.

158
00:10:36,093 --> 00:10:37,303
Make up for my ruined life.

159
00:10:37,845 --> 00:10:39,388
Make up for it!

160
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:40,973
You make up for my ruined life.

161
00:10:41,098 --> 00:10:43,559
Make up for my arm too.
How dare you bite me?

162
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:46,395
Get out of this house!

163
00:10:47,355 --> 00:10:48,689
I will never leave.

164
00:10:49,231 --> 00:10:50,358
Over my dead body!

165
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:51,692
If you leave,

166
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:53,778
A-jin will forgive me.

167
00:10:58,616 --> 00:10:59,533
Did you just

168
00:11:00,284 --> 00:11:01,827
hit me?

169
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:03,537
You bit me.

170
00:11:03,788 --> 00:11:06,207
Did you just hit me?

171
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:09,919
-Did you just do that?
-I'm going to get tetanus.

172
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:12,254
I should hurry to the hospital.

173
00:11:14,256 --> 00:11:17,301
Love is but a dream.
It's like a dirty towel.

174
00:11:57,383 --> 00:11:59,218
Did you say that you know my mother?

175
00:12:04,932 --> 00:12:06,267
Thirty-five years ago,

176
00:12:07,643 --> 00:12:10,020
a poor married couple
who used to be tenants in this place

177
00:12:11,313 --> 00:12:13,607
adopted a girl.

178
00:12:13,858 --> 00:12:16,569
She scratched my daughter's face
and it will leave a scar.

179
00:12:16,819 --> 00:12:19,029
She stole this doll too!

180
00:12:19,363 --> 00:12:20,531
Sorry, ma'am.

181
00:12:21,282 --> 00:12:24,994
Why did you adopt such a brat?
Send her back to the orphanage!

182
00:12:25,911 --> 00:12:29,623
Because she clawed
at the landlord's daughter,

183
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:33,878
she was sent back to the orphanage.

184
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,339
The girl who was sent back

185
00:12:38,632 --> 00:12:39,550
is me.

186
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:43,929
Then, that doll...

187
00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:45,848
Yes.

188
00:12:46,724 --> 00:12:48,017
That doll...

189
00:12:48,642 --> 00:12:51,353
You accused me of stealing it.

190
00:12:56,275 --> 00:12:57,401
Don't worry.

191
00:12:58,027 --> 00:13:00,029
I'm not here to argue about that.

192
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:06,118
I want you

193
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:09,038
to sell this house to me.

194
00:13:14,001 --> 00:13:16,253
Mom lost her consciousness
because of a stroke.

195
00:13:16,378 --> 00:13:19,840
I got divorced ten years ago
and I live with my family now.

196
00:13:20,382 --> 00:13:21,425
But this house

197
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:24,929
is about to be auctioned.

198
00:13:25,346 --> 00:13:29,058
I was going to get my revenge
by buying that house,

199
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:32,228
but how unlucky!

200
00:13:32,895 --> 00:13:34,021
This is disappointing.

201
00:13:35,898 --> 00:13:36,982
Where should I take you?

202
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:44,406
Welcome!

203
00:13:49,411 --> 00:13:52,081
Give me this one, this one, this one...

204
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:53,624
and this one.

205
00:13:55,376 --> 00:13:56,961
Just give me everything in this store.

206
00:14:33,831 --> 00:14:35,583
Be careful. Come on.

207
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:36,625
Sorry.

208
00:14:38,794 --> 00:14:39,712
Stop it.

209
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:42,798
You're out. You over there!

210
00:14:43,465 --> 00:14:44,675
I can't believe this.

211
00:14:48,095 --> 00:14:50,139
This one is hard to wear and take off.

212
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:52,141
That one! Give that to me.

213
00:14:59,356 --> 00:15:01,483
How is this...

214
00:15:01,984 --> 00:15:05,321
Give me everything here.

215
00:15:07,698 --> 00:15:08,866
Move.

216
00:15:22,004 --> 00:15:23,672
That will be 19 million
and 800 thousand won.

217
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:27,885
I will deliver these

218
00:15:27,968 --> 00:15:30,137
to your St. Palace Suite tomorrow morning.

219
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:32,723
Okay. Get something to eat
with the change.

220
00:15:33,974 --> 00:15:37,353
-She must be a nouveau riche.
-She obviously lacks elegance.

221
00:15:49,907 --> 00:15:50,741
Goodness.

222
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:53,535
It was Jae-hui, right?

223
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:57,748
You and your siblings don't stand
a chance against Bok-ja Park.

224
00:15:58,332 --> 00:16:00,334
-What did you say?
-It's a different story

225
00:16:00,709 --> 00:16:02,002
if someone helps.

226
00:16:03,921 --> 00:16:05,547
You should help us, Mr. Han.

227
00:16:05,756 --> 00:16:07,216
Please let us reclaim our company.

228
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:09,426
Our goal is to sell the company back.

229
00:16:09,551 --> 00:16:12,054
We can sell Daesung Pulp
for 80 billion won.

230
00:16:12,262 --> 00:16:16,016
Taking the value of the assets
and sales into account,

231
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:19,895
it seems likely that 80 billion won
can be recovered within five years.

232
00:16:20,771 --> 00:16:22,815
There's an investment bank
that we do business with.

233
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:25,401
Paying ten billion for the contract,
ten billion for the first payment,

234
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:28,153
and having the rest financed
through initial public offering

235
00:16:28,237 --> 00:16:31,365
are the ways to save your company.

236
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:33,867
To put it simply,

237
00:16:34,284 --> 00:16:36,620
borrow ten billion won
using the real estate

238
00:16:36,704 --> 00:16:39,832
and the account receivables as collateral,

239
00:16:39,915 --> 00:16:42,251
finance the rest by investments,
and then acquire the company.

240
00:16:43,168 --> 00:16:45,421
Where do I attract investments?

241
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:47,172
I can do it for you.

242
00:16:48,132 --> 00:16:49,675
Just prepare the ten billion won.

243
00:16:50,926 --> 00:16:52,636
How do you expect me
to prepare ten billion won?

244
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,805
You can use Chairman Ahn's cash
or real estate property

245
00:16:54,972 --> 00:16:57,725
as a collateral
and take a loan out from a bank.

246
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:02,021
But why are you reinvesting in a company

247
00:17:02,104 --> 00:17:05,274
that you have already bought to help us?

248
00:17:10,571 --> 00:17:14,366
My nickname in this industry is hyena.

249
00:17:15,451 --> 00:17:17,494
But I have a critical weakness.

250
00:17:18,328 --> 00:17:21,373
I become weak-willed
when I see a woman I'm attracted to.

251
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:24,084
With nothing in return...

252
00:17:26,378 --> 00:17:27,796
From the moment I saw you,

253
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:29,757
I wanted to help.

254
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:49,693
Damn it.

255
00:17:58,327 --> 00:17:59,161
Hello?

256
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:01,038
A-jin, it's me.

257
00:18:08,212 --> 00:18:10,339
-Ma'am.
-How have you been?

258
00:18:10,672 --> 00:18:12,549
Why didn't you let yourself in...

259
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:13,884
Is Ju-mi inside?

260
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:26,688
So, I am the lady in charge
of this house, right?

261
00:18:27,064 --> 00:18:30,734
You got divorced and the bitch fled.

262
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:34,863
So, that means I should be in charge.

263
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,449
Where is the bank account?

264
00:18:38,075 --> 00:18:41,245
Where is the bank account of this house?

265
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:43,205
Go upstairs.

266
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:46,875
Did you eat yet?

267
00:18:47,376 --> 00:18:48,210
A-jin.

268
00:18:50,003 --> 00:18:51,630
What do I do with Un-gyu now?

269
00:18:52,923 --> 00:18:54,800
How can Father do this?

270
00:18:56,343 --> 00:18:59,888
Why did he give all his money
to that bitch?

271
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:02,933
All of this is your fault!

272
00:19:04,017 --> 00:19:06,311
Why did you let her in this house?

273
00:19:06,895 --> 00:19:09,690
How can you leave
without taking responsibility?

274
00:19:10,941 --> 00:19:14,778
A-jin. We should catch her
and take back our money.

275
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,572
Think about Ji-hu.

276
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:18,073
She sold the company

277
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:19,992
and took all the money.

278
00:19:20,868 --> 00:19:22,077
Can you bear with that?

279
00:19:23,453 --> 00:19:26,373
Those assets weren't mine anyway.

280
00:19:26,456 --> 00:19:28,750
-What?
-Those belonged to Father.

281
00:19:28,959 --> 00:19:30,252
I will manage by myself.

282
00:19:30,544 --> 00:19:34,047
I will raise Ji-hu myself
and take responsibility

283
00:19:34,423 --> 00:19:35,591
for my actions.

284
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:38,010
Stop trying to act sophisticated!

285
00:19:38,635 --> 00:19:40,179
What a loser.

286
00:19:40,304 --> 00:19:43,390
But I will make her come back.

287
00:19:43,807 --> 00:19:46,101
Since I started this, I'll end it.

288
00:19:47,227 --> 00:19:49,688
So, hang in there.

289
00:19:49,813 --> 00:19:51,565
You can't be weak like this.

290
00:19:52,399 --> 00:19:53,525
It's over.

291
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:58,572
There is a reason
why I had to bear with this.

292
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:01,533
Father passed out,
so he's at the hospital.

293
00:20:01,617 --> 00:20:02,576
You should go and see him.

294
00:20:03,493 --> 00:20:05,704
That crazy old man. Why should I go there?

295
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:07,039
What has he done for me?

296
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:11,460
This is why Father gave
all your assets to that woman.

297
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,129
Maybe he knew

298
00:20:15,088 --> 00:20:17,382
that this would happen.

299
00:20:18,258 --> 00:20:20,802
He probably thought that he would be
better off giving his assets

300
00:20:21,303 --> 00:20:23,347
to that woman
rather than giving it to his children.

301
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:25,807
That's why he is crazy!

302
00:20:27,476 --> 00:20:28,727
It's his choice.

303
00:20:29,436 --> 00:20:30,979
It's our fault.

304
00:20:33,649 --> 00:20:35,359
Are you in with her?

305
00:20:35,943 --> 00:20:37,152
Did both of you plot against us?

306
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:40,030
I will never forgive

307
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:43,283
both Father and that bitch...

308
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:46,745
Tell him to just die!

309
00:20:47,496 --> 00:20:50,457
Just tell Mr. Chairman to die!

310
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:53,043
Do you know

311
00:20:54,211 --> 00:20:55,045
where she is?

312
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:05,722
His pupillary reflex and electrocardiogram
shows that he's fine,

313
00:21:06,139 --> 00:21:07,599
but why won't he wake up?

314
00:21:48,557 --> 00:21:50,892
Welcome. Did you make a reservation?

315
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:52,769
-No.
-Do you want consultation?

316
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:54,980
Follow me to the consultation room.

317
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:57,691
I want to consult
with the head doctor right away.

318
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:02,279
The procedure is to consult with me first,
then you can meet the head doctor.

319
00:22:02,738 --> 00:22:05,115
The Gold Class Procedure here...

320
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:07,409
A wealthy person I know

321
00:22:07,534 --> 00:22:09,745
had an anti-aging treatment here
priced at 100 million won.

322
00:22:10,078 --> 00:22:11,872
I am interested in it.

323
00:22:11,955 --> 00:22:15,042
Okay. I will arrange a meeting
with the head doctor right away.

324
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:16,209
Please follow me.

325
00:22:21,715 --> 00:22:22,591
Hello.

326
00:22:23,425 --> 00:22:26,470
I heard that you are interested
in the Gold Class Anti-Aging Procedure.

327
00:22:26,636 --> 00:22:29,473
Yes. How young would I look

328
00:22:29,556 --> 00:22:31,475
and how fast?

329
00:22:32,517 --> 00:22:33,435
You are impatient.

330
00:22:33,894 --> 00:22:36,646
I will explain in detail
about the procedure.

331
00:22:37,064 --> 00:22:37,898
If I may...

332
00:22:43,445 --> 00:22:46,323
First, we will transfer
and rearrange the fat,

333
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:48,492
then tighten the skin with a laser,

334
00:22:48,617 --> 00:22:51,620
give you 50 placenta shots
and then 30 Cinderella shots.

335
00:22:51,787 --> 00:22:52,621
Also...

336
00:22:54,998 --> 00:22:57,250
You bastard!
How dare you do this to me again.

337
00:22:58,043 --> 00:23:01,338
You treat your wife as a sandbag,
you coward.

338
00:23:01,463 --> 00:23:03,340
Do you think you can mess around with me?

339
00:23:03,423 --> 00:23:04,341
Let go of me!

340
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:07,886
Okay. I'll let go.

341
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:12,474
Gosh.

342
00:23:12,557 --> 00:23:15,268
Don't get plastic surgery from him.

343
00:23:15,352 --> 00:23:18,605
This bastard is a total prick.
He messed around with my wife.

344
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:23,443
Call the police you bastard.
Call the police.

345
00:23:24,402 --> 00:23:25,946
She went to the hospital
for plastic surgery.

346
00:23:26,947 --> 00:23:27,781
Yes.

347
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:31,326
Okay, president.

348
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:43,338
-Did you finish your business?
-Go to the hotel.

349
00:23:43,547 --> 00:23:44,381
Yes.

350
00:23:46,216 --> 00:23:47,175
Gosh.

351
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:51,429
The rich people in this country
are total shits.

352
00:23:53,765 --> 00:23:55,392
How dull.

353
00:23:56,017 --> 00:23:57,185
My gosh.

354
00:24:02,399 --> 00:24:04,693
Your wife and the lawyer

355
00:24:05,735 --> 00:24:07,404
looked pretty intimate.

356
00:24:08,363 --> 00:24:09,489
That's not true.

357
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:11,908
You seem to wish it wasn't true,

358
00:24:12,117 --> 00:24:13,743
but the two are very close.

359
00:24:14,411 --> 00:24:16,371
He brought her home once

360
00:24:16,454 --> 00:24:19,124
in his arms when she was drunk.

361
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:23,170
Nothing happened since I was there,

362
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:24,713
but surely,

363
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:29,551
something would have happened if I wasn't.

364
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:34,598
Did he come inside the house?

365
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:38,226
His eyes were full of affection.

366
00:24:43,607 --> 00:24:45,650
Come on. Why does she keep calling me?

367
00:24:47,944 --> 00:24:50,280
How do you expect to get back the company?

368
00:24:51,448 --> 00:24:52,824
Stop dreaming yourself.

369
00:24:53,992 --> 00:24:54,993
Goodness.

370
00:24:56,161 --> 00:24:58,079
What should I do with the bastard?

371
00:25:03,084 --> 00:25:05,921
I am here to deliver the products
that Ji-yeong Park ordered to her suite.

372
00:25:06,504 --> 00:25:10,342
She's not here, but I got the notice.
I'll show you the way.

373
00:25:42,082 --> 00:25:42,916
It's delicious today.

374
00:25:48,004 --> 00:25:49,089
What brings you here?

375
00:25:49,256 --> 00:25:51,633
Listen to me carefully. I will appeal!

376
00:25:52,008 --> 00:25:54,844
I cannot accept this divorce.

377
00:25:55,053 --> 00:25:56,763
I will take back my wife.

378
00:25:57,138 --> 00:25:59,224
This is not over until it's over.

379
00:25:59,349 --> 00:26:02,227
I won't divorce her.
I will cancel this divorce.

380
00:26:02,477 --> 00:26:04,813
If you are going to appeal,
hire a lawyer first.

381
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:06,898
-Do you want me to recommend you one?
-Shut up!

382
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:10,568
A lawyer that you recommend
would be on your side, not mine!

383
00:26:11,736 --> 00:26:15,740
Hey. Stop flirting with my wife.

384
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:17,575
Leave, please.

385
00:26:18,034 --> 00:26:21,204
Since you are appealing,
I will prepare for my case too.

386
00:26:21,788 --> 00:26:24,291
I will protect her

387
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:28,795
from guys like you at all costs.

388
00:26:31,089 --> 00:26:31,923
Hey!

389
00:26:32,424 --> 00:26:35,844
A-jin has her own pride and emotions!

390
00:26:35,927 --> 00:26:37,929
You stay and leave as you please,

391
00:26:38,013 --> 00:26:40,265
and you live your life the way you want.

392
00:26:40,473 --> 00:26:41,683
You hurt her

393
00:26:43,059 --> 00:26:44,477
and now you want her back.

394
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:50,525
I will protect her from you!

395
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:54,904
Hey. What did you just say?

396
00:26:56,948 --> 00:26:59,534
I was right.

397
00:26:59,993 --> 00:27:01,494
You two are fooling around, right?

398
00:27:01,578 --> 00:27:04,331
Watch your words! Fooling around?

399
00:27:04,414 --> 00:27:06,499
-Lawyer...
-Do you really

400
00:27:07,959 --> 00:27:09,044
have feelings for my wife?

401
00:27:09,961 --> 00:27:10,879
Of course.

402
00:27:11,588 --> 00:27:14,341
How could a man not have feelings
for a woman like her?

403
00:27:14,883 --> 00:27:17,010
I do like her very much.

404
00:27:17,844 --> 00:27:18,845
You bastard!

405
00:27:20,221 --> 00:27:21,056
Do you

406
00:27:24,225 --> 00:27:25,435
like her a lot?

407
00:27:26,353 --> 00:27:29,147
If you hurt her once more,

408
00:27:30,607 --> 00:27:32,025
you will die in my hands.

409
00:27:32,776 --> 00:27:33,777
Did you say appeal?

410
00:27:35,195 --> 00:27:36,529
Do as you wish.

411
00:27:36,821 --> 00:27:37,906
You little...

412
00:27:37,989 --> 00:27:39,657
Kill me!

413
00:27:39,783 --> 00:27:41,451
Kill me!

414
00:27:44,454 --> 00:27:45,705
Did you just hit me?

415
00:27:47,374 --> 00:27:49,334
Leave or I'll call the police.

416
00:27:49,542 --> 00:27:51,544
Police? Call the police.

417
00:27:51,753 --> 00:27:54,506
I should call the police since you hit me.

418
00:27:54,589 --> 00:27:55,882
Leave! Now!

419
00:28:04,349 --> 00:28:06,309
I want to ask you a favor.

420
00:28:06,893 --> 00:28:10,188
Please let A-jin and I get back together.

421
00:28:11,773 --> 00:28:13,817
Please, tall guy.

422
00:28:15,443 --> 00:28:18,863
Please...

423
00:28:32,752 --> 00:28:34,295
I'm planning to take a rest in the suite.

424
00:28:34,504 --> 00:28:37,382
So, be here at the meeting
with Mr. Han tomorrow morning.

425
00:28:37,465 --> 00:28:39,467
-I will escort you.
-There's no need. Go.

426
00:29:12,208 --> 00:29:15,462
-She must be a nouveau riche.
-She obviously lacks elegance.

427
00:29:47,118 --> 00:29:47,952
A-JIN WOO

428
00:29:48,953 --> 00:29:52,624
I am heading to your hotel.
We really need to meet.

429
00:29:58,004 --> 00:29:59,631
NAVIGATING TO ST. PALACE

430
00:29:59,714 --> 00:30:01,299
ENTRANCE, PARKING LOT,
STORE, RESTUARANT

431
00:30:13,978 --> 00:30:14,896
Hello?

432
00:30:15,271 --> 00:30:17,148
-Where are you?
-None your business.

433
00:30:18,191 --> 00:30:19,067
A-jin.

434
00:30:19,484 --> 00:30:20,693
Let's get back together.

435
00:30:21,319 --> 00:30:23,947
It was my fault. I am officially
asking you for forgiveness.

436
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:25,281
Hang up. I'm busy.

437
00:30:25,573 --> 00:30:29,160
A-jin. Don't ever meet him!

438
00:30:29,828 --> 00:30:31,579
Can't you stop barking?

439
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:34,207
What? Barking?

440
00:30:35,208 --> 00:30:38,711
I know you're saying such hurtful things
to get over me.

441
00:30:39,504 --> 00:30:40,421
A-jin.

442
00:30:41,089 --> 00:30:43,675
You must be joking. We are divorced.

443
00:30:44,092 --> 00:30:46,803
If you keep insisting,
I will ask for a restraining order.

444
00:30:47,011 --> 00:30:50,014
That bastard hit me. I got hit.

445
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:53,017
He's violent. He's a very low quality.

446
00:30:54,435 --> 00:30:55,979
A-jin?

447
00:30:56,354 --> 00:30:58,690
Are you listening?

448
00:30:59,691 --> 00:31:03,111
A-jin!

449
00:31:28,177 --> 00:31:31,431
Destruction of property cases
cannot be settled,

450
00:31:31,806 --> 00:31:33,016
so there will be a punishment.

451
00:31:33,224 --> 00:31:34,392
I will not settle.

452
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:38,771
I won't either. It's his second time
he did this to me.

453
00:31:39,355 --> 00:31:41,858
Then, is he the guy
with the golf club before?

454
00:31:41,941 --> 00:31:43,568
It wasn't me, I swear!

455
00:31:43,651 --> 00:31:47,947
-If it wasn't you, who was it?
-How dare you talk down to me!

456
00:31:50,825 --> 00:31:54,037
GOOD DEEDS MAKE A GOOD PLACE TO LIVE.

457
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:08,009
THE RESIDENT HAS BEEN WREAKING HAVOC
ON OUR RESIDENTIAL ENVIRONMENT

458
00:32:08,134 --> 00:32:10,803
"Good deeds make

459
00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:13,139
a good place to"...

460
00:32:32,492 --> 00:32:35,161
Can you please tell Ji-yeong Park
in the suite that I'm coming up.

461
00:32:35,244 --> 00:32:36,537
Sure. Wait a second.

462
00:32:38,331 --> 00:32:39,832
What's your name?

463
00:32:41,501 --> 00:32:42,418
A-jin Woo.

464
00:32:50,134 --> 00:32:52,595
What's the name of the person
in the suite?

465
00:32:54,263 --> 00:32:55,556
It's A-jin Woo.

466
00:32:56,724 --> 00:32:57,600
A-jin Woo.

467
00:33:27,714 --> 00:33:29,590
Is this what you wanted?

468
00:33:35,304 --> 00:33:36,472
I am happy.

469
00:33:37,974 --> 00:33:42,228
Money is always so great.

470
00:33:42,895 --> 00:33:45,982
Your happiness won't last too long.

471
00:33:46,816 --> 00:33:49,527
Before you realize

472
00:33:49,694 --> 00:33:53,197
that all you have wished for was nothing,

473
00:33:53,406 --> 00:33:54,824
you will fall into misfortune.

474
00:33:56,325 --> 00:33:57,160
Do you know why?

475
00:33:57,744 --> 00:34:00,580
It's because you know

476
00:34:00,663 --> 00:34:03,958
what you did was wrong.

477
00:34:08,379 --> 00:34:10,381
You know

478
00:34:11,257 --> 00:34:13,051
that you did something wrong, right?

479
00:34:17,930 --> 00:34:18,848
A-jin Woo.

480
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:21,017
You got divorced, didn't you?

481
00:34:21,851 --> 00:34:26,022
You shouldn't talk like that
when you insist on living in a house

482
00:34:26,105 --> 00:34:27,732
that belongs to the woman

483
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:31,027
who took your husband.

484
00:34:33,321 --> 00:34:36,657
I only insist on taking what is mine.

485
00:34:37,450 --> 00:34:39,619
I have rights to that property.

486
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:43,206
When I successfully placed
Daesung Pulp products into a supermarket,

487
00:34:43,289 --> 00:34:47,502
Mr. Chairman gave me a performance fee.

488
00:34:47,585 --> 00:34:48,836
I used it to buy the property.

489
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,379
That's where I draw the line.

490
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:52,965
I only desire what is mine.

491
00:34:54,258 --> 00:34:56,260
That's the difference between us.

492
00:34:57,345 --> 00:34:59,305
If you wish for things that aren't yours,

493
00:34:59,722 --> 00:35:01,724
it will only end in destruction.

494
00:35:02,391 --> 00:35:03,267
Destruction?

495
00:35:05,061 --> 00:35:06,771
I will never end up in destruction.

496
00:35:07,271 --> 00:35:10,983
Money makes you king.

497
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:13,528
Actually,

498
00:35:14,529 --> 00:35:18,574
I have enough money
to make you kneel before me.

499
00:35:18,866 --> 00:35:22,161
No. I will never kneel before you.

500
00:35:22,912 --> 00:35:25,039
I found something
much more valuable than money.

501
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:28,543
Make everything go back to the way it was.

502
00:35:28,626 --> 00:35:29,460
I don't want to.

503
00:35:29,961 --> 00:35:30,878
Why should I?

504
00:35:31,504 --> 00:35:34,132
He decided to give you his shares
with his impaired decision-making ability

505
00:35:34,215 --> 00:35:35,925
caused by Alzheimer's disease.

506
00:35:38,219 --> 00:35:39,095
Alzheimer's disease?

507
00:35:41,389 --> 00:35:43,391
Why? You don't think so?

508
00:35:43,474 --> 00:35:46,435
Why are you being such an amateur?

509
00:35:47,436 --> 00:35:48,688
Amateur?

510
00:35:59,949 --> 00:36:01,200
DIAGNOSIS

511
00:36:03,786 --> 00:36:05,955
An eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth.

512
00:36:06,164 --> 00:36:06,998
NAME: TAE-DONG AHN

513
00:36:07,081 --> 00:36:10,626
Didn't you think I'd prepare for this
when he gave you those shares

514
00:36:11,377 --> 00:36:14,088
to such a person like you?

515
00:36:17,008 --> 00:36:18,092
On behalf of my father-in-law,

516
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:20,094
I'm going to sue you
to retrieve our shares.

517
00:36:22,221 --> 00:36:23,055
What?

518
00:36:29,061 --> 00:36:30,313
MESSAGE, KI-HO KANG

519
00:36:33,024 --> 00:36:37,570
Chairman Tae-Dong Ahn Gives
53.41 Percent of His Shares

520
00:36:37,653 --> 00:36:39,113
One way is...

521
00:36:39,864 --> 00:36:42,658
If he gave those shares
while he was impaired,

522
00:36:42,909 --> 00:36:43,910
the shares can be retrieved.

523
00:36:46,412 --> 00:36:50,541
I think he got dementia after his stroke.

524
00:36:58,049 --> 00:36:59,342
Is life that easy for you?

525
00:37:00,801 --> 00:37:03,679
Things that are gained easily
will be taken away easily.

526
00:37:04,055 --> 00:37:05,514
That's how this world works.

527
00:37:06,557 --> 00:37:08,893
The money you took and that diagnosis.

528
00:37:09,685 --> 00:37:10,895
This is the reality.

529
00:37:11,687 --> 00:37:13,856
A fake deserves a fake.

530
00:37:16,984 --> 00:37:18,110
I will give you a chance.

531
00:37:18,694 --> 00:37:20,154
Father passed out.

532
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:22,365
Make him wake up again.

533
00:37:23,532 --> 00:37:25,660
I'm saying that we should start over.

534
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:28,287
Fair play. No more fraud.

535
00:37:28,996 --> 00:37:32,875
Wake him up and take what's yours

536
00:37:33,584 --> 00:37:35,169
and no more!

537
00:37:41,509 --> 00:37:44,512
I will wait for your call. Bok-ja Park.

538
00:38:12,456 --> 00:38:14,083
You should have died.

539
00:38:15,167 --> 00:38:16,419
Why are you still alive?

540
00:38:21,215 --> 00:38:22,133
You're here.

541
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:28,931
My father-in-law will wake up, right?

542
00:38:30,391 --> 00:38:34,103
He'll wake up whenever he wants to.

543
00:39:02,923 --> 00:39:04,592
Are things going well, Mr. Han?

544
00:39:06,093 --> 00:39:07,720
I am onto something.

545
00:39:42,838 --> 00:39:46,050
I'm here to end you.

546
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:50,679
If you do anything stupid,
I'll kill you and go to jail.

547
00:39:50,888 --> 00:39:51,764
That simple.

548
00:39:52,348 --> 00:39:53,974
So, don't think to do anything stupid.

549
00:39:56,477 --> 00:39:58,270
-What do you want?
-Money.

550
00:39:58,896 --> 00:39:59,730
Give it to me.

551
00:40:01,565 --> 00:40:03,734
You will never kill me.

552
00:40:03,818 --> 00:40:04,860
Are you sure about that?

553
00:40:06,487 --> 00:40:08,572
I will call 911 on my way out of here.

554
00:40:09,156 --> 00:40:14,245
If they arrive on time,
maybe you'll be able to keep your life.

555
00:40:18,582 --> 00:40:21,210
Okay, I'll give it to you.

556
00:40:21,502 --> 00:40:23,671
Let go!

557
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:25,005
Let go!

558
00:40:44,191 --> 00:40:45,109
Password.

559
00:40:47,570 --> 00:40:48,821
Password!

560
00:40:52,741 --> 00:40:55,786
Three, five...

561
00:40:55,870 --> 00:40:56,704
Hey.

562
00:40:58,205 --> 00:40:59,373
If you are lying,

563
00:40:59,665 --> 00:41:02,293
I will take out your eyes
before I kill you.

564
00:41:08,591 --> 00:41:11,177
Three, five, eight...

565
00:41:15,598 --> 00:41:18,350
-Where do you think you're going?
-If I don't go, the police will come.

566
00:41:19,226 --> 00:41:22,146
I asked for protection.

567
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,648
Ma'am, this is Secretary Oh.

568
00:41:25,065 --> 00:41:26,901
I urgently need to tell you something.

569
00:41:39,205 --> 00:41:40,372
Are you hurt?

570
00:41:42,458 --> 00:41:43,584
It's nothing serious.

571
00:41:46,629 --> 00:41:47,755
What's the matter?

572
00:41:48,923 --> 00:41:53,052
I think Mr. Han got his information
from this woman until now.

573
00:41:55,304 --> 00:41:57,306
Do you know who she is?

574
00:41:59,266 --> 00:42:01,060
She does look familiar.

575
00:42:09,026 --> 00:42:12,154
Okay then. Let's talk again tomorrow.

576
00:42:12,613 --> 00:42:14,198
Okay. Have a good rest.

577
00:42:18,452 --> 00:42:20,246
An attacker has entered
Ms. Chairman's suite.

578
00:42:27,169 --> 00:42:28,003
Hurry!

579
00:42:38,305 --> 00:42:41,267
So, it was Secretary Oh all along.
I knew it. That bastard.

580
00:42:41,433 --> 00:42:43,602
No wonder he told me
where you were so willingly.

581
00:42:44,270 --> 00:42:46,981
You two were on the same side.

582
00:42:47,523 --> 00:42:50,484
Tell me the password.
Three, five, eight...

583
00:42:53,904 --> 00:42:56,824
Hey. I told you
not to think of anything stupid!

584
00:42:57,658 --> 00:42:58,784
No!

585
00:43:00,286 --> 00:43:02,496
I went through all that
to get my hands on this.

586
00:43:02,871 --> 00:43:04,915
No! Let go!

587
00:43:13,424 --> 00:43:14,466
Are you okay?

588
00:43:16,594 --> 00:43:18,178
Did you tell Mr. Han?

589
00:43:18,721 --> 00:43:19,597
Well...

590
00:43:22,725 --> 00:43:25,561
How much do you tell Mr. Han?

591
00:43:26,395 --> 00:43:28,772
That Secretary Oh was in my room

592
00:43:30,274 --> 00:43:32,318
or Jae-gu was in my room?

593
00:43:32,401 --> 00:43:34,570
Or do you tell him more than that?

594
00:43:39,325 --> 00:43:40,701
Don't be surprised.

595
00:43:41,201 --> 00:43:44,246
I'm not stupid. How can I not know?

596
00:43:45,122 --> 00:43:48,792
I asked Mr. Han for Mr. Lee.

597
00:43:50,127 --> 00:43:53,839
There are no sides,

598
00:43:55,215 --> 00:43:57,926
no enemies and no loyalty in this world.

599
00:43:59,678 --> 00:44:01,555
It's all about money.

600
00:44:17,905 --> 00:44:19,448
It's a relief that it ended just there.

601
00:44:23,077 --> 00:44:25,621
I think I am well qualified now.

602
00:44:25,788 --> 00:44:27,206
Who is the next target?

603
00:44:27,289 --> 00:44:29,541
But why was Secretary Oh

604
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,252
in your room last night?

605
00:44:35,714 --> 00:44:38,967
Can't you guess what happens
when a man and a woman are in a hotel

606
00:44:39,301 --> 00:44:40,219
that late?

607
00:44:41,637 --> 00:44:42,596
I see.

608
00:44:43,263 --> 00:44:44,723
I guess it was a dumb question.

609
00:44:47,351 --> 00:44:49,103
There is a problem.

610
00:44:49,895 --> 00:44:53,982
A-jin Woo has Mr. Chairman's
diagnosis of dementia.

611
00:44:55,317 --> 00:44:58,195
She's trying to turn the table
by claiming impairment.

612
00:44:59,363 --> 00:45:00,823
She is smarter than I thought.

613
00:45:01,490 --> 00:45:03,242
You said A-jin, right?

614
00:45:04,034 --> 00:45:07,162
The one whose husband cheated...

615
00:45:09,331 --> 00:45:12,918
I heard that he cheated on her
by cycling every day in the morning.

616
00:45:14,002 --> 00:45:15,337
I heard that they divorced.

617
00:45:18,924 --> 00:45:20,217
How did you know that?

618
00:45:37,025 --> 00:45:40,654
Send me the picture
of the woman who met Mr. Han.

619
00:45:43,073 --> 00:45:45,367
If you need any help, let me know.

620
00:45:45,826 --> 00:45:47,911
Speaking of which,
would you like to go for a drink?

621
00:45:49,288 --> 00:45:51,748
You seem a bit different
than what I have heard.

622
00:45:52,583 --> 00:45:53,709
What did you hear?

623
00:45:54,751 --> 00:45:57,713
What did you hear about me?

624
00:45:57,921 --> 00:46:00,048
Nothing. I must have been confused.

625
00:46:00,340 --> 00:46:01,592
I am saying that you are beautiful.

626
00:46:05,053 --> 00:46:06,305
MR. OH

627
00:46:10,809 --> 00:46:14,897
Who was it?

628
00:46:15,272 --> 00:46:17,524
Ms. Chairman, what do you want for food?

629
00:46:18,567 --> 00:46:21,278
Let's just have beef rib soup
and radish kimchi.

630
00:46:23,530 --> 00:46:24,448
Wait...

631
00:46:29,745 --> 00:46:32,039
I remember who she is.

632
00:46:32,372 --> 00:46:33,207
Hey.

633
00:46:34,583 --> 00:46:36,627
I'll have lunch later.
I need to go somewhere.

634
00:46:43,634 --> 00:46:46,553
He's not answering?

635
00:46:47,471 --> 00:46:50,349
Damn it. I worked before my payment.

636
00:46:51,058 --> 00:46:53,435
Where did he flee to
after leaving us here?

637
00:46:53,644 --> 00:46:56,438
We won't get paid if we fail, right?

638
00:46:56,522 --> 00:46:57,940
Shut up, you bastard.

639
00:47:03,070 --> 00:47:04,988
Let us meet Jae-gu's wife.

640
00:47:07,491 --> 00:47:08,867
Excuse me, ma'am.

641
00:47:09,243 --> 00:47:10,786
Stop calling me that!

642
00:47:14,248 --> 00:47:15,165
Gosh.

643
00:47:23,632 --> 00:47:26,051
Ms. Jo.

644
00:47:27,135 --> 00:47:28,720
Didn't you clean up this room yesterday?

645
00:47:29,763 --> 00:47:31,390
Yes, I did.

646
00:47:34,851 --> 00:47:36,645
Did she come by yesterday?

647
00:47:36,812 --> 00:47:38,146
I'm not sure.

648
00:47:38,522 --> 00:47:42,401
I just received a call from Bang-soon.
Apparently, Jae-gu can't be reached.

649
00:48:04,673 --> 00:48:08,010
These were all styled by A-jin.

650
00:48:08,093 --> 00:48:10,929
I was wondering why you look so stylish.

651
00:48:11,305 --> 00:48:12,723
It was A-jin, of course.

652
00:48:12,806 --> 00:48:15,267
-I'm thinking of asking her.
-Me too.

653
00:48:15,392 --> 00:48:16,727
Where is A-jin?

654
00:48:26,194 --> 00:48:28,697
Hello. I am Jae-seok Ahn, A-jin's husband.

655
00:48:28,864 --> 00:48:30,240
I am here to meet A-jin.

656
00:48:30,324 --> 00:48:33,243
You're not her husband. You got divorced.

657
00:48:33,452 --> 00:48:35,162
No. It's not over yet.

658
00:48:35,245 --> 00:48:37,497
A-jin's ex-husband?

659
00:48:37,581 --> 00:48:38,749
Not an ex...

660
00:48:39,499 --> 00:48:40,876
The cycling cheater?

661
00:48:41,084 --> 00:48:43,754
Yes. The cheating Armstrong.

662
00:48:43,837 --> 00:48:45,088
Why is it the cheating Armstrong?

663
00:48:45,172 --> 00:48:47,174
Armstrong is a professional cyclist.

664
00:48:48,717 --> 00:48:50,510
I see.

665
00:48:50,844 --> 00:48:53,347
A-jin is not here.
She went on a business trip.

666
00:48:54,389 --> 00:48:57,476
It's probably not my business,
but can I tell you something?

667
00:48:57,559 --> 00:48:59,394
No. I hate to hear those things.

668
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:03,607
Should I find a man for A-jin?

669
00:49:04,107 --> 00:49:07,110
Well, she likes to be in a relationship.

670
00:49:07,611 --> 00:49:09,029
I don't think she'll accept.

671
00:49:19,206 --> 00:49:20,290
I need to use the bathroom.

672
00:49:22,459 --> 00:49:23,627
Why did he come here?

673
00:49:23,710 --> 00:49:26,213
I heard that he

674
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:27,589
DKHP.

675
00:49:28,048 --> 00:49:29,508
What does that mean?

676
00:49:29,591 --> 00:49:32,511
It means that he doesn't know his place.

677
00:49:34,221 --> 00:49:36,139
Oh my god, that's insane.

678
00:49:37,432 --> 00:49:41,186
The phone you have dialed is turned off...

679
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:49,194
Goodness. What brings you here?

680
00:49:50,487 --> 00:49:51,530
Let's go inside.

681
00:49:54,199 --> 00:49:57,244
I'm sorry, but madams
are not allowed here.

682
00:50:01,373 --> 00:50:02,624
I didn't know such a place

683
00:50:03,542 --> 00:50:05,168
existed in this world.

684
00:50:05,419 --> 00:50:07,963
Yes. This is such a place.

685
00:50:08,755 --> 00:50:10,924
Only housemaids can enter this place.

686
00:50:31,319 --> 00:50:34,865
I thought that low-class people
cannot enter areas meant for high class,

687
00:50:36,158 --> 00:50:38,952
but high-class people can enter

688
00:50:39,995 --> 00:50:43,039
wherever the low-class people can go.

689
00:50:43,582 --> 00:50:44,958
Are you coming back again?

690
00:50:45,751 --> 00:50:47,461
I thought you left for good.

691
00:50:50,630 --> 00:50:51,798
I see.

692
00:50:52,007 --> 00:50:54,926
This is where all the rumors

693
00:50:55,135 --> 00:50:57,471
and news were made.

694
00:50:59,931 --> 00:51:01,057
Why are you doing this?

695
00:51:01,349 --> 00:51:03,143
I have a question.

696
00:51:04,060 --> 00:51:07,898
What do you think the people
of Daesung Pulp will do to me?

697
00:51:08,190 --> 00:51:10,233
-How could I know?
-Hey.

698
00:51:10,984 --> 00:51:12,402
I bet you know.

699
00:51:12,778 --> 00:51:16,531
Didn't you get information
from a man named Min-gi Han?

700
00:51:22,537 --> 00:51:24,206
Leeway and foul play.

701
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:27,334
Those are the things that you need
to survive in this place.

702
00:51:28,543 --> 00:51:31,963
That's what you need to move up in class.

703
00:51:35,842 --> 00:51:37,010
Since we're alone,

704
00:51:37,969 --> 00:51:39,137
do you want some tea?

705
00:51:47,103 --> 00:51:48,688
BONG-CHEOL GU, AGE 36, MALE

706
00:51:51,233 --> 00:51:53,151
Was this person discharged
from the hospital?

707
00:51:53,276 --> 00:51:55,612
Yes, he was discharged
and left the hospital an hour ago.

708
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:15,674
-Hello?
-Hello, ma'am.

709
00:52:16,383 --> 00:52:17,717
This is Bong-cheol Gu.

710
00:52:18,844 --> 00:52:21,304
-Bong-cheol Gu?
-I was the physical therapist

711
00:52:22,472 --> 00:52:23,849
for Mr. Chairman. The tent incident...

712
00:52:25,141 --> 00:52:26,184
Why did you call me?

713
00:52:26,601 --> 00:52:28,311
I need to tell you something.

714
00:52:29,813 --> 00:52:31,940
Okay. Where do you want to meet?

715
00:52:32,774 --> 00:52:35,193
Do you know what the scariest emotion is?

716
00:52:35,569 --> 00:52:36,403
Desire?

717
00:52:37,445 --> 00:52:39,447
No. It's jealousy.

718
00:52:41,199 --> 00:52:44,661
All the housemaids in this room
were jealous of you.

719
00:52:47,122 --> 00:52:49,499
Weren't you the one

720
00:52:51,251 --> 00:52:52,544
who was the most jealous?

721
00:53:00,635 --> 00:53:02,679
Tell me everything you know about me.

722
00:53:03,513 --> 00:53:05,849
Based on all the information
you have gathered,

723
00:53:06,933 --> 00:53:10,812
what do you think
will end up happening to me?

724
00:53:13,273 --> 00:53:14,983
I think maybe

725
00:53:17,402 --> 00:53:19,237
you will end up dead.

726
00:53:37,923 --> 00:53:39,424
There must be something you want to say.

727
00:53:45,430 --> 00:53:46,723
Bok-ja Park and I

728
00:53:48,433 --> 00:53:50,393
knew each other from the orphanage.

729
00:54:43,279 --> 00:54:45,198
She forced me to do it.

730
00:54:45,573 --> 00:54:47,200
We strategically approached him.

731
00:54:48,243 --> 00:54:49,577
I gave Bok-ja

732
00:54:50,996 --> 00:54:52,706
information about Mr. Chairman.

733
00:54:54,416 --> 00:54:57,085
The goal was to seduce Mr. Chairman
and get something for ourselves.

734
00:54:59,254 --> 00:55:00,797
Indeed. I see.

735
00:55:01,297 --> 00:55:02,132
But

736
00:55:03,591 --> 00:55:05,135
she knew about you.

737
00:55:06,386 --> 00:55:08,555
Even before I told her about you,

738
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:11,891
she knew your name.

739
00:55:26,656 --> 00:55:28,867
You shouldn't have trusted me.

740
00:55:33,288 --> 00:55:35,832
You shouldn't have fallen for me.

741
00:55:47,719 --> 00:55:50,513
You can never make it to the upper class.

742
00:55:51,181 --> 00:55:53,224
Even though you have a lot of money,

743
00:55:53,475 --> 00:55:55,685
you're nothing more than
a caregiver for the sick.

744
00:56:32,555 --> 00:56:35,016
-Hello?
-I am looking for a caregiver.

745
00:56:37,602 --> 00:56:41,064
Just help him become more happy

746
00:56:41,147 --> 00:56:42,440
and healthy.

747
00:56:43,066 --> 00:56:45,318
I will pay you more for that.

748
00:56:50,406 --> 00:56:53,326
This is your opportunity
to repent your sins.

749
00:56:53,910 --> 00:56:55,787
Make everything right!

750
00:57:03,294 --> 00:57:04,587
But ma'am.

751
00:57:09,259 --> 00:57:10,802
Hiring a person is a big deal.

752
00:57:12,053 --> 00:57:14,681
You shouldn't be hiring people so easily.

753
00:57:17,851 --> 00:57:19,519
There must be some qualifications.

754
00:57:22,814 --> 00:57:26,484
A person who likes
Matisse and Kandinsky would be nice.

755
00:57:46,713 --> 00:57:48,423
Bok-ja Park.

756
00:57:50,216 --> 00:57:51,301
A-jin Woo.

757
00:58:13,448 --> 00:58:17,744
I'm no longer a caregiver of your house.

758
00:58:17,827 --> 00:58:19,037
Why so late at night?

759
00:58:19,120 --> 00:58:21,080
Why else? Because I miss you.

760
00:58:21,164 --> 00:58:24,375
Who's the one person that your mom
and dad cherish the most?

761
00:58:24,459 --> 00:58:25,376
It's you.

762
00:58:25,460 --> 00:58:29,297
If you knew that, why did you do it?
You're still too immature.

763
00:58:29,380 --> 00:58:32,467
I will never give up on this house.
I've lost way too much because of you.

764
00:58:32,550 --> 00:58:33,384
You bastard!

765
00:58:35,011 --> 00:58:37,388
Mr. Han is very sly.

766
00:58:37,472 --> 00:58:39,265
It seems like Mr. Han has a hidden agenda.

767
00:58:39,349 --> 00:58:40,600
Do you think I'm a joke?

768
00:58:40,683 --> 00:58:43,561
You're not suited for this world.
You're too emotional.

769
00:58:43,770 --> 00:58:45,772
You're a piece of trash.

770
00:58:45,855 --> 00:58:47,398
Everything was planned.

771
00:58:47,482 --> 00:58:50,151
The uphill climb was easier
than you thought, wasn't it?

772
00:58:50,235 --> 00:58:52,820
Your climb back down will be
even easier. Look forward to it.

773
00:58:52,987 --> 00:58:55,865
-Where is my husband?
-How am I supposed to know that?

774
00:58:55,949 --> 00:58:57,116
If you don't, who does?

775
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:59,410
You kept Jae-gu Ahn alive, right?

776
00:58:59,494 --> 00:59:02,413
Give the money back!
I have to give it back to the bank.

777
00:59:02,497 --> 00:59:04,082
If I don't, we'll all die!

778
00:59:04,165 --> 00:59:06,376
-Don't lay a finger on that house.
-It's already too late.

779
00:59:06,459 --> 00:59:08,378
This household is done for.

780
00:59:08,461 --> 00:59:12,048
Jae-hui Ahn, that crazy bitch gave
this house to the bank as collateral!

781
00:59:12,173 --> 00:59:14,300
I'm the one who brought you
into that house.

782
00:59:14,467 --> 00:59:16,803
I should take responsibility
for what I've done.

783
00:59:16,970 --> 00:59:19,681
I will never have it taken away from me.

784
00:59:25,979 --> 00:59:26,896
Father.

785
00:59:27,939 --> 00:59:28,815
Bok-ja...

786
00:59:29,148 --> 00:59:31,109
Where is she now?

787
00:59:31,442 --> 00:59:35,321
How can a caregiver mess up
the whole family?

788
00:59:35,989 --> 00:59:37,198
It's all Jae-seok's fault.

789
00:59:37,282 --> 00:59:39,117
My life has been ruined.

790
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:40,577
I divorced my wife.

791
00:59:40,743 --> 00:59:42,537
-Because of you...
-Because of you...

792
00:59:42,620 --> 00:59:44,872
-Because of you...
-Because of you,

793
00:59:46,124 --> 00:59:48,126
I am neglected by everyone.

794
00:59:49,252 --> 00:59:51,879
He decided to give you his shares
with his impaired decision-making ability

795
00:59:51,963 --> 00:59:53,965
-caused by Alzheimer's disease.
-What?

796
00:59:54,048 --> 00:59:55,883
It will only end in destruction.

797
00:59:55,967 --> 00:59:59,554
Bok-ja Park and I knew each other
from the orphanage.

798
01:00:00,471 --> 01:00:03,141
The goal was to seduce Mr. Chairman
and get something for ourselves.

799
01:00:04,392 --> 01:00:06,227
She knew your name.

800
01:00:08,229 --> 01:00:10,773
You shouldn't have fallen for me.

801
01:00:11,983 --> 01:00:14,068
Even though you have a lot of money,

802
01:00:14,402 --> 01:00:16,613
you're nothing more than
a caregiver for the sick.

803
01:00:19,282 --> 01:00:21,659
-Hello?
-I am looking for a caregiver.

804
01:00:23,953 --> 01:00:26,873
This is your opportunity
to repent your sins.

805
01:00:27,332 --> 01:00:28,750
Make everything right!

806
01:00:28,833 --> 01:00:30,126
