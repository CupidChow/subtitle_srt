1
00:00:28,528 --> 00:00:30,530
3, 2, go pick up.

2
00:00:38,455 --> 00:00:39,789
Ashdres! Ashdres!

3
00:00:40,206 --> 00:00:42,500
Ashtine! Ashtine! Ashtine!

4
00:00:43,626 --> 00:00:45,920
We love you Ashbin!

5
00:00:47,338 --> 00:00:50,008
We love you Ashdres!

6
00:01:05,607 --> 00:01:08,610
On the third one, we’ll
just look at Andres.

7
00:01:08,693 --> 00:01:10,695
It’s my first time performing...

8
00:01:11,529 --> 00:01:14,949
whether it’s singing or dancing,
even just a little bit of dancing.

9
00:01:14,991 --> 00:01:17,118
It's my first time
performing on stage, so...

10
00:01:17,702 --> 00:01:20,455
I’m a bit nervous…
just a little, just a little.

11
00:01:20,789 --> 00:01:24,959
But yeah, overall I’m still excited
because it’s my first time and...

12
00:01:25,001 --> 00:01:29,214
it's the first time that everyone
in the cast is together again.

13
00:01:29,255 --> 00:01:30,256
For the first time.

14
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:31,340
Hello.

15
00:01:31,549 --> 00:01:33,134
Yes, Rabin!

16
00:01:33,176 --> 00:01:35,887
Let’s go! I shouldn’t be nervous.

17
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:38,098
I need to do my best.

18
00:01:38,348 --> 00:01:39,015
Let's go!

19
00:01:39,224 --> 00:01:42,894
So from stage right, to center stage.

20
00:01:43,269 --> 00:01:47,482
In this show, you’ll see
a lot of that happening.

21
00:01:48,066 --> 00:01:51,611
Oh, so this person sings?
Oh, that one dances too!

22
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:54,823
They’re actually amazing when
they’re all together on stage.

23
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:58,785
So it almost looks like a theater play,

24
00:01:59,494 --> 00:02:02,163
music video and concert

25
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:03,956
rolled into one.

26
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:06,334
We hadn’t seen each other in so long.

27
00:02:06,376 --> 00:02:11,589
So on our first day of rehearsals, I
used up all my energy right away.

28
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:15,051
I gave it my all—like, 1000
percent of my energy was there.

29
00:02:15,093 --> 00:02:18,721
Then on our next
rehearsal, I was knocked out.

30
00:02:19,597 --> 00:02:22,392
And the succeeding
rehearsals were so exhausting.

31
00:02:22,433 --> 00:02:24,102
But also really fun at the same time.

32
00:02:24,227 --> 00:02:26,646
Because, you know, we
were enjoying dancing.

33
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:29,065
We got to see each other’s performances.

34
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:31,526
We saw everyone smiling.

35
00:02:31,651 --> 00:02:33,528
There’s a lot to look forward to.

36
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:36,656
There's singing, dancing…

37
00:02:36,781 --> 00:02:39,325
Fan service, games—everything's there.

38
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:42,203
So we really hope you like it and enjoy it.

39
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:54,757
It all started with a
well-loved Wattpad story.

40
00:02:54,966 --> 00:02:56,718
It went on for months.

41
00:02:56,759 --> 00:02:58,636
It got a couple of reads.

42
00:02:59,053 --> 00:03:01,890
And there's just one random comment.

43
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:02,807
Not even serious.

44
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:04,976
So I thought, oh, no
one’s really reading this.

45
00:03:05,268 --> 00:03:09,314
Then almost a year later,
it started getting hundreds.

46
00:03:09,564 --> 00:03:11,357
That’s when I noticed
it was really growing.

47
00:03:11,566 --> 00:03:13,318
I never, ever imagined.

48
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:15,195
That it would get that many reads.

49
00:03:16,112 --> 00:03:21,075
Viva, with it's track record of producing
some of the best Wattpad adaptations,

50
00:03:21,409 --> 00:03:24,579
set its eyes on the story that would go on

51
00:03:24,621 --> 00:03:28,249
to become a record breaking youth series.

52
00:03:30,168 --> 00:03:33,713
Viva, then tapped seasoned
director Theodore Boborol

53
00:03:33,755 --> 00:03:35,715
as the captain of the ship.

54
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:40,011
Leading the cast, the showbiz
royalty, Andres Muhlach.

55
00:03:40,345 --> 00:03:42,931
Who, despite his family's popularity,

56
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:44,807
built a name for himself

57
00:03:44,933 --> 00:03:47,936
and proved that he can shine on his own.

58
00:03:49,854 --> 00:03:51,940
Given the biggest break of her career,

59
00:03:52,315 --> 00:03:55,193
Ashtine Olviga did not waist her chance,

60
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:59,280
and proved that she can
be Viva's next top actress.

61
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:06,204
Completing today's most
sought-after on screen love triangle,

62
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:07,747
is Rabin Angeles.

63
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:11,199
Who charmed his way
to the hearts of many fans.

64
00:04:12,877 --> 00:04:16,130
The whole cast, composed
of relatively new actors,

65
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:18,466
showcased great acting skills,

66
00:04:18,633 --> 00:04:22,053
and gave justice to the beloved
characters from the book.

67
00:04:24,222 --> 00:04:26,182
The series started with a bang!

68
00:04:26,557 --> 00:04:31,729
With a record breaking, 1
million views for its pilot episode.

69
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,732
There's no other way but up.

70
00:04:35,566 --> 00:04:37,735
And up they go!

71
00:04:38,403 --> 00:04:40,989
'Ang Mutya ng Section E' quickly became

72
00:04:41,072 --> 00:04:44,117
a trending series because of good reviews.

73
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:48,329
More casual viewers were hooked
because of good word of mouth

74
00:04:48,496 --> 00:04:52,375
and fan edits generating millions of views.

75
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:56,754
In just three months,
the series and the cast,

76
00:04:56,838 --> 00:04:59,173
became household names.

77
00:04:59,841 --> 00:05:04,595
AMNSE's popularity translated
from online to on ground events.

78
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:09,726
Drawing in jam-packed crowds
in city and provincial events.

79
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:16,482
AMNSE gave birth to the
'Daleng dale' dance craze!

80
00:05:17,066 --> 00:05:20,695
The other songs in the series
experienced a boost in popularity

81
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:23,406
and became top trending songs.

82
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:31,664
Soon after...

83
00:05:32,081 --> 00:05:35,501
AMNSE became a rising global hit.

84
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:40,423
A huge part of Ang Mutya ng
Section E's phenomenal success

85
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:45,928
is the unwavering love
and support of the loyal fans.

86
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:48,848
Thank you Section E Nation!

87
00:05:50,224 --> 00:05:52,435
And to celebrate our success,

88
00:05:52,727 --> 00:05:54,812
let us party and have fun

89
00:05:55,063 --> 00:06:00,360
with our most favorite students from HVIS.

90
00:06:00,985 --> 00:06:05,156
For the ultimate fan meet and greet show!

91
00:06:05,573 --> 00:06:08,618
Live at the NEW FRONTIER THEATER.

92
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:12,789
This is... Section E NATION!

93
00:06:40,858 --> 00:06:44,987
Oh-oh, oh-oh.

94
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:55,998
Oh-oh, oh-oh.

95
00:06:58,376 --> 00:07:00,795
I feel giddy, this is your effect.

96
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:03,172
What's left for me to
do is rush to the toilet.

97
00:07:03,214 --> 00:07:05,633
You frighten me, you're too much.

98
00:07:05,758 --> 00:07:08,219
The smile on your face is stuck on my mind.

99
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:10,513
Oh, what the hell? You're always like that.

100
00:07:10,596 --> 00:07:12,849
You don't know what to do
except make me feel things

101
00:07:13,015 --> 00:07:16,601
I don’t know anymore, should
I still be thinking about this.

102
00:07:16,602 --> 00:07:17,955
Or maybe I should just stop altogether?

103
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:19,939
You only text at night.

104
00:07:20,022 --> 00:07:22,775
While my messages have
no effect

105
00:07:22,817 --> 00:07:24,861
I wait, wondering what’s next.

106
00:07:24,902 --> 00:07:26,571
Just to calm my mind a bit.

107
00:07:26,612 --> 00:07:30,700
Oh, what is this I'm feeling?

108
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:36,539
Stop stalling, stalling,
stalling, stop going in circles.

109
00:07:36,581 --> 00:07:40,334
Can you just stop being so dramatic?

110
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:46,382
Stop stalling, stalling,
stalling, stop going in circles.

111
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:50,094
You talk about many things.

112
00:07:50,178 --> 00:07:52,305
Why not talk about us? We kind of fit.

113
00:07:52,346 --> 00:07:54,599
But you’re slow, can’t figure that out.

114
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:57,225
Just a bit more and I’ll
probably say goodbye.

115
00:07:57,226 --> 00:07:59,437
Come on, really? That’s all you'll ever do?

116
00:07:59,562 --> 00:08:01,981
You don’t know what to do
except make me feel things

117
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:05,443
I don’t know anymore, should
I still be thinking about this.

118
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:06,879
Or maybe I should just stop altogether?

119
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:08,905
You only text at night.

120
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:11,908
While my messages have
no effect

121
00:08:11,949 --> 00:08:13,826
I wait, wondering what’s next.

122
00:08:13,951 --> 00:08:15,536
Just to calm my mind a bit.

123
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:19,081
Oh, what is this I'm feeling?

124
00:08:20,249 --> 00:08:25,379
Stop stalling, stalling,
stalling, stop going in circles.

125
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:28,925
Can you just stop being so dramatic?

126
00:08:30,259 --> 00:08:35,473
Stop stalling, stalling,
stalling, stop going in circles.

127
00:08:36,265 --> 00:08:38,851
Stalling, stalling

128
00:08:38,893 --> 00:08:41,270
Stalling, stalling

129
00:08:41,312 --> 00:08:43,731
Stalling, stalling

130
00:08:43,773 --> 00:08:51,071
Stalling, stalling

131
00:08:51,072 --> 00:08:53,032
Stalling, stalling.

132
00:08:53,115 --> 00:08:54,867
Still stalling.

133
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:58,579
Oh, what is this I'm feeling?

134
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:04,585
Stop stalling, stalling,
stalling, stop going in circles.

135
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:09,173
Can you please
stop being dramatic?

136
00:09:09,298 --> 00:09:14,512
Stop stalling, stalling, stalling,
stop going in circles

137
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:23,771
Before we went out, I was
already crying backstage.

138
00:09:23,938 --> 00:09:28,150
I could hear your screams
and guys, it’s so heartwarming.

139
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:32,196
It means a lot and I really just
can't thank you guys enough.

140
00:09:32,321 --> 00:09:34,321
All of you, every one of
you. Thank you very much!

141
00:09:34,365 --> 00:09:36,826
The opening was so fun, wow, the crowd.

142
00:09:36,867 --> 00:09:39,579
So supportive, so many people, jam-packed.

143
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:41,372
So hot! Super solid!

144
00:09:41,872 --> 00:09:43,165
So, so happy.

145
00:09:43,749 --> 00:09:45,459
We didn’t expect this many fans.

146
00:09:45,543 --> 00:09:46,669
They’re that energetic!

147
00:09:47,044 --> 00:09:50,798
Wow, we were just dreaming
of this, now we’re here!

148
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,383
Thank you so much to those who came,

149
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:53,843
I hope you appreciate our efforts.

150
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:56,304
It's so fulfilling,

151
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,848
Because of course...

152
00:09:59,348 --> 00:10:01,225
I see the kids...

153
00:10:03,561 --> 00:10:06,814
Dancing to... my choreography.

154
00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:10,860
That’s the most fulfilling, of
course there will be challenges.

155
00:10:10,901 --> 00:10:13,529
Like of course, the kids
can be mischievous...

156
00:10:13,654 --> 00:10:14,894
We all went through that anyway.

157
00:10:15,364 --> 00:10:21,762
But they're disciplined
enough to... to finish.

158
00:10:21,787 --> 00:10:25,166
And learn all the
choreography I taught them.

159
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:29,962
Woohoo!

160
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,214
Intense!

161
00:10:37,553 --> 00:10:38,553
Wow!

162
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,351
What's up section E Nation!

163
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:49,106
Hello, New Frontier Theater, Everybody!

164
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:55,029
Wow! Everyone, Wow!

165
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:05,706
Wait, the King of Ulupong is gonna speak.

166
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:06,957
Okay, thank you, thank you.

167
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:08,000
Wait a minute.

168
00:11:09,585 --> 00:11:11,754
We can't believe we're
all gathered here today.

169
00:11:12,296 --> 00:11:15,591
For our ultimate fan, meet and greet show!

170
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:18,511
You guys are awesome!

171
00:11:20,554 --> 00:11:22,640
Even though the show
may have ended last week,

172
00:11:23,391 --> 00:11:25,476
the bond and friendship amongst the cast

173
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:28,020
still remains solid and forever.

174
00:11:28,896 --> 00:11:30,606
That's why we're here, right guys?

175
00:11:30,898 --> 00:11:32,942
Yeah!

176
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:35,653
You know Andres, that’s right

177
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:37,405
but later on that,

178
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:40,700
Later, because we might cry.

179
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:44,245
It’s day one but the feels
is intense, do you feel it?

180
00:11:44,762 --> 00:11:48,140
Right? Team day one, make some noise!

181
00:11:51,001 --> 00:11:54,380
Amazing! As early as
now, we’re already thankful

182
00:11:54,505 --> 00:11:56,841
for the support you’ve given us.

183
00:11:57,007 --> 00:11:58,884
This won’t be possible without you guys

184
00:11:59,009 --> 00:12:01,679
so we should all enjoy tonight.

185
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:02,721
Do you agree?

186
00:12:06,075 --> 00:12:09,704
You know guys, our hearts are full.

187
00:12:10,009 --> 00:12:11,301
And that’s because of you!

188
00:12:12,148 --> 00:12:16,318
Besides the special performances
of the cast of Mutya ng Section E,

189
00:12:16,819 --> 00:12:21,031
we also have other special
performances from special guests.

190
00:12:21,365 --> 00:12:22,365
Is that right?

191
00:12:22,491 --> 00:12:24,952
Yes, that’s right Andre!

192
00:12:25,703 --> 00:12:29,498
Who’s excited to see...

193
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:31,917
- Who?! Who?!
- Amiel Sol!

194
00:12:36,005 --> 00:12:37,005
And also...

195
00:12:37,715 --> 00:12:44,905
who wants to hear the hit song Tibok live

196
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:47,850
by Earl Agustin?!

197
00:12:49,643 --> 00:12:51,687
But wait, there’s more.

198
00:12:52,104 --> 00:12:54,440
Of course, we also have with us tonight...

199
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:56,692
Rob Deniel!

200
00:13:00,838 --> 00:13:03,674
And of course the hitmakers of Daleng-dale,

201
00:13:03,785 --> 00:13:05,745
G-A-T!

202
00:13:07,415 --> 00:13:08,663
You guys want more?

203
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:10,288
Yes?

204
00:13:10,748 --> 00:13:13,250
Well if you want more, we
will definitely give you all more

205
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:17,463
because later on, we have a Q and A with...

206
00:13:17,838 --> 00:13:19,882
Andres and Ashtine!

207
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:25,513
Let's see if you'll survive
from their answers.

208
00:13:25,538 --> 00:13:28,040
Because you might pass out from the feels.

209
00:13:29,373 --> 00:13:31,834
I hope they can handle it.

210
00:13:31,859 --> 00:13:36,030
Wow, it’s only day one but
there’s already so much going on!

211
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:40,110
So guys, watch out for the fun games with.

212
00:13:40,194 --> 00:13:43,739
Ulupong boys and Sando boys!

213
00:13:43,906 --> 00:13:45,282
And that’s not all!

214
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:48,577
There’s also a pakilig game with...

215
00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:50,329
Rabin!

216
00:13:52,915 --> 00:13:53,915
Wait a minute.

217
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:55,543
What is that pakilig game?

218
00:13:55,751 --> 00:13:57,253
I’m excited for that too.

219
00:13:57,628 --> 00:14:00,589
But I just want to say hello
to the entire Section E Nation.

220
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,967
Here at the New Frontier Theater.

221
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:04,635
Let’s get this started!

222
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:08,138
Woohoo Let's go!

223
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:11,308
And to give us some powerful performances,

224
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:16,272
here’s a back-to-back dance trend
from our Mutya boys and Mutya girls.

225
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:17,522
Let's go!

226
00:14:17,815 --> 00:14:18,815
Let's go!

227
00:14:24,905 --> 00:14:26,031
Check. Check.

228
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:30,494
To your position, go.

229
00:14:30,995 --> 00:14:31,995
To your position.

230
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:38,836
Each and everyone of them has projects.

231
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:42,464
So it's really hard to gather
everyone to one space.

232
00:14:43,132 --> 00:14:46,552
And the same time, try
to learn a choreography.

233
00:14:46,635 --> 00:14:51,265
That is quite hard to do on stage.

234
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:55,269
Because most of them,
if not all, are actors,

235
00:14:55,769 --> 00:14:57,313
and some of them are performers.

236
00:15:01,859 --> 00:15:03,569
The boys are preparing.

237
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:07,489
Our boys, they are getting ready
so they won’t make mistakes later.

238
00:15:07,615 --> 00:15:10,868
I also need to jump in so I could practice.

239
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:14,413
Actually, we have four days of rehearsal.

240
00:15:14,496 --> 00:15:16,665
Our biggest surprise here is...

241
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:20,543
those you wouldn’t
expect to dance, will dance.

242
00:15:20,544 --> 00:15:24,840
They’ll give their best dance
moves, so watch out for that.

243
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:26,967
Our bond was built here because

244
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:30,137
we practiced and bonded for several days.

245
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:32,848
Even outside rehearsal, we bonded.

246
00:15:35,924 --> 00:15:38,135
Honestly, I don’t really dance.

247
00:15:38,354 --> 00:15:39,966
I don’t know how to dance.

248
00:15:40,397 --> 00:15:42,249
So during rehearsals,

249
00:15:42,274 --> 00:15:45,653
I really had to catch up, and
there were many changes.

250
00:15:45,819 --> 00:15:48,238
But that’s part of the process.

251
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:52,660
So we had to adjust, and I had to
kind of get out of my comfort zone.

252
00:15:52,701 --> 00:15:53,803
Because I really don’t dance.

253
00:15:53,827 --> 00:15:55,287
But shout out to Andre,

254
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:57,623
because despite the
struggle, he gave it his all.

255
00:15:57,706 --> 00:15:58,808
We’re gonna give it our all.

256
00:15:58,832 --> 00:16:02,169
Feel excited, feel
happy, this is for the fans.

257
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:04,213
At the end of the day,
this is for you guys.

258
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:06,757
We love you, we want to
show our love and give it our all.

259
00:16:07,091 --> 00:16:08,092
We can’t wait. Wow.

260
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:13,138
We mastered our blocking.

261
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:18,936
So it turns out better on stage.

262
00:16:19,186 --> 00:16:20,813
I’m both excited and nervous...

263
00:16:20,854 --> 00:16:23,440
because this is my first time

264
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:26,485
performing in front of a whole stage,

265
00:16:27,069 --> 00:16:28,112
with, you know...

266
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,905
two thousand people, wow!

267
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:31,240
And I don’t even...

268
00:16:32,199 --> 00:16:35,119
know how to dance, so I’m nervous too.

269
00:16:35,202 --> 00:16:38,747
But thanks to the coach.

270
00:16:39,415 --> 00:16:41,040
He guided us well.

271
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:43,711
So I feel our performance
will be super okay.

272
00:16:43,752 --> 00:16:46,755
And I’m excited to perform.

273
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:51,385
Hey guys, minus five,
four hours, till opening.

274
00:16:52,302 --> 00:16:53,429
We’re about to do a rundown.

275
00:16:54,388 --> 00:16:56,932
I’m very tired but we love you guys.

276
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:59,393
So we’re still excited. Mwah!

277
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:02,312
I feel energized, I feel like...

278
00:17:02,646 --> 00:17:04,231
you know the pressure that's like,

279
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,817
“Oh, this is it, I have to give it my all!”

280
00:17:07,317 --> 00:17:08,610
No room for mistakes.

281
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:10,612
I’m super excited that...

282
00:17:11,238 --> 00:17:13,449
I’m gonna be able to attempt to dance,

283
00:17:14,241 --> 00:17:16,410
and of course, I get to be with my.

284
00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:18,829
Section E classmates
and the rest of the cast.

285
00:17:19,288 --> 00:17:21,749
I’m excited to see how
the day's gonna unfold.

286
00:17:21,832 --> 00:17:24,376
I’m enjoying it but I’m nervous.

287
00:17:24,626 --> 00:17:25,419
Nervous?

288
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:26,461
Super nervous, bro.

289
00:17:26,754 --> 00:17:30,758
Of course, it's different in
practice, than in front of a crowd.

290
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:31,800
We’ll all give our best.

291
00:17:32,426 --> 00:17:33,469
For the fans.

292
00:17:38,182 --> 00:17:39,182
Going in...

293
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:41,476
Going in...

294
00:17:48,275 --> 00:17:49,275
Young One!

295
00:17:53,697 --> 00:17:55,866
I want you to wine wine

296
00:17:55,949 --> 00:17:57,951
Asian beauty, wine wine.

297
00:17:57,993 --> 00:18:00,037
Bad girl like you, wine wine.

298
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:02,581
Go go, wine wine.

299
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:19,848
I lost my way, somewhere in another galaxy.

300
00:18:20,849 --> 00:18:27,648
Too much to take, these
memories, end in tragedy.

301
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:32,236
And all of these places, all of these faces

302
00:18:32,402 --> 00:18:35,781
I didn't wanna let you down

303
00:18:35,989 --> 00:18:39,743
And all these mistakes
of mine, I can't replace it

304
00:18:40,035 --> 00:18:42,746
I've gotta move on somehow.

305
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:46,667
Healing energy on me.

306
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:51,254
When it's 11:11, I need it

307
00:18:51,255 --> 00:18:54,383
Healing energy on me.

308
00:18:54,424 --> 00:18:58,137
Baby, can you make a wish for me?

309
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:01,932
Don't act like you forgot.

310
00:19:02,516 --> 00:19:04,309
Bitch better have my money

311
00:19:04,393 --> 00:19:06,186
my money, my money.

312
00:19:06,228 --> 00:19:07,813
My money... better have my money.

313
00:19:07,938 --> 00:19:09,690
Don't act like you forgot.

314
00:19:09,731 --> 00:19:11,316
Don't act like you forgot.

315
00:19:40,512 --> 00:19:41,889
Don't act like you forgot.

316
00:19:42,306 --> 00:19:43,640
Bitch better have my money.

317
00:19:47,811 --> 00:19:51,064
You won’t get a taste of this.

318
00:19:51,356 --> 00:19:54,776
If you're only after my body,

319
00:19:54,902 --> 00:19:58,322
That can grind and turn

320
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:01,074
I will still follow my heart.

321
00:20:01,408 --> 00:20:05,412
The heart of a romantic man.

322
00:20:05,537 --> 00:20:08,957
If you're only after my body,

323
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:12,252
That can grind and turn.

324
00:20:12,836 --> 00:20:15,505
I will still follow my heart.

325
00:20:15,589 --> 00:20:19,134
The heart of a romantic man.

326
00:20:20,552 --> 00:20:23,805
Yay, yay, ya.

327
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:30,771
Yay, yay, yay, ya, ya.

328
00:20:30,854 --> 00:20:33,815
Yay, yay, yay, ya.

329
00:20:34,775 --> 00:20:37,402
Yay, yay, ya.

330
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:44,743
Yay, yay, yay, ya, ya.

331
00:20:44,993 --> 00:20:47,704
Yay, yay, yay, ya.

332
00:21:08,058 --> 00:21:10,477
Our last rehearsal was super fun.

333
00:21:10,686 --> 00:21:12,562
Even though it was tiring,

334
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:15,106
We’re doing all this for you.

335
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:18,860
Of course, we want
your ticket to be worth it.

336
00:21:19,027 --> 00:21:20,612
And of course so you can see us.

337
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:23,072
And we just want to return

338
00:21:23,073 --> 00:21:25,200
the love that you are giving us.

339
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:29,413
Leave the world behind, let it fade.

340
00:21:29,496 --> 00:21:33,250
Follow the rhythm—don’t let it slip away.

341
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:36,795
Keep moving, don’t hold back.

342
00:21:36,878 --> 00:21:38,964
When you’re on the actual stage, of course,

343
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:42,092
there’s so many of us, but it was nicer

344
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:46,555
because the stage here at
New Frontier Theater is so wide,

345
00:21:46,596 --> 00:21:51,768
so I feel like we were able to
see how many people will be here,

346
00:21:51,852 --> 00:21:55,480
and it really felt real.

347
00:21:55,939 --> 00:21:58,317
Wow guys, I don’t get tired from dancing,

348
00:21:58,567 --> 00:22:01,653
I get tired from crossing the
stage. I’m traveling backstage!

349
00:22:01,695 --> 00:22:03,113
It’s really far!

350
00:22:03,196 --> 00:22:06,241
Andres even said earlier
during his opening that

351
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:08,159
he has to cross three times.

352
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:08,368
So imagine the cardio he has to do.
He has to cross three times.

353
00:22:08,369 --> 00:22:11,038
So imagine the cardio he has to do.

354
00:22:11,204 --> 00:22:13,999
We really enjoyed it
because it was just us again,

355
00:22:14,082 --> 00:22:16,667
and we got to be together
again after some time,

356
00:22:16,668 --> 00:22:18,754
for rehearsals and everything.

357
00:22:18,795 --> 00:22:20,672
So it was so, so fun.

358
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:22,924
We didn’t even notice our tiredness

359
00:22:22,966 --> 00:22:24,968
because we were so excited.

360
00:22:25,719 --> 00:22:27,054
Like, legit guys,

361
00:22:27,095 --> 00:22:30,640
like super, super duper excited!

362
00:22:31,224 --> 00:22:34,394
We can’t wait to see you... all.

363
00:22:34,686 --> 00:22:38,231
Yes! Of course, we’ll dance hard for you.

364
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:43,612
It's gonna be me, Rafa Victorino,
Sara Joe, Angela Muji, and Jastine Lim.

365
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:47,156
Watch out for the
performance of the Mutya girls.

366
00:22:47,157 --> 00:22:48,408
Hope you enjoy it.

367
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:54,706
It’s scary, nerve-wracking.

368
00:22:54,956 --> 00:22:57,501
Like, I’m nervous even
though there’s no audience yet.

369
00:22:58,251 --> 00:23:00,003
Rawr. So... good luck to us.

370
00:23:01,797 --> 00:23:03,715
Getting flustered.

371
00:23:03,965 --> 00:23:05,801
Getting flustered.

372
00:23:06,301 --> 00:23:08,303
Getting flustered.

373
00:23:08,345 --> 00:23:10,680
Getting flustered, getting flustered.

374
00:23:10,931 --> 00:23:13,015
Getting flustered.

375
00:23:13,016 --> 00:23:13,100
Getting flustered
Getting flustered.

376
00:23:13,101 --> 00:23:14,851
Getting flustered.

377
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:17,354
Getting flustered.

378
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:18,604
Getting flustered.

379
00:23:18,605 --> 00:23:19,773
Getting flustered.

380
00:23:20,357 --> 00:23:23,652
You've been going out more every night.

381
00:23:24,903 --> 00:23:28,532
Always going out places.

382
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:32,828
And then coming home in the morning.

383
00:23:34,446 --> 00:23:38,116
You'd just change
clothes then go out again.

384
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:42,129
I thought the two of have agreed?

385
00:23:42,212 --> 00:23:44,589
Didn’t you promise to change?

386
00:23:44,631 --> 00:23:46,633
But why did this happen?

387
00:23:47,217 --> 00:23:49,678
Getting flustered, getting flustered.

388
00:23:49,719 --> 00:23:51,721
My mind is restless, getting anxious.

389
00:23:51,805 --> 00:23:54,182
Getting flustered, getting flustered.

390
00:23:54,307 --> 00:23:56,226
Why am I having a bad feeling.

391
00:23:56,351 --> 00:23:58,812
Getting flustered, getting flustered.

392
00:23:58,979 --> 00:24:02,482
Tell me, am I the only one?

393
00:24:02,649 --> 00:24:05,777
I'm getting flustered, getting flustered.

394
00:24:05,819 --> 00:24:07,654
Getting flustered.

395
00:24:08,029 --> 00:24:09,990
Getting flustered.

396
00:24:10,323 --> 00:24:12,325
Getting flustered.

397
00:24:12,367 --> 00:24:14,911
Getting flustered, getting flustered.

398
00:24:44,274 --> 00:24:46,443
Getting flustered, getting flustered.

399
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:48,778
My mind is restless, getting anxious.

400
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:51,072
Getting flustered, getting flustered.

401
00:24:51,406 --> 00:24:53,157
Why am I having a bad feeling.

402
00:24:53,576 --> 00:24:55,619
Getting flustered, getting flustered.

403
00:24:56,119 --> 00:24:59,331
Tell me, am I the only one?

404
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:03,251
Getting flustered, getting flustered.

405
00:25:39,579 --> 00:25:42,958
Who could’ve known.

406
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:46,920
That the stars would
lead me right into you?

407
00:25:47,254 --> 00:25:51,424
And my heart began to beat like a song.

408
00:25:54,302 --> 00:25:58,056
Leave the world behind and take a pause.

409
00:25:58,181 --> 00:26:01,810
Just follow the rhythm—don’t resist it.

410
00:26:01,893 --> 00:26:05,647
Keep moving, don’t hold back.

411
00:26:05,814 --> 00:26:09,985
You and I, together, let
our hearts dance in sync.

412
00:26:10,068 --> 00:26:13,029
Move as one, move as one.

413
00:26:13,655 --> 00:26:17,701
Move as one, to the beat
of our hearts, and dance.

414
00:26:17,742 --> 00:26:20,870
Move as one, move as one.

415
00:26:21,538 --> 00:26:22,831
Move as one.

416
00:26:22,872 --> 00:26:25,458
Move as one, to the beat
of our hearts, and dance.

417
00:26:29,671 --> 00:26:32,841
Who knows what will happen
when you give in to the rhythm?

418
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:36,678
Our hearts might just
find the perfect timing.

419
00:26:37,304 --> 00:26:41,433
Our lives can change in a glimpse.

420
00:26:41,683 --> 00:26:44,102
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh.

421
00:26:44,603 --> 00:26:48,148
There's a reason why we are here.

422
00:26:48,481 --> 00:26:52,110
The hear has a plan and we must follow it.

423
00:26:52,235 --> 00:26:56,448
A new color paints our
world—don’t blink, don’t miss it.

424
00:26:56,990 --> 00:26:59,326
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh.

425
00:26:59,868 --> 00:27:03,246
Leave the world behind and take a pause.

426
00:27:03,413 --> 00:27:07,042
Just follow the rhythm—don’t resist it.

427
00:27:07,167 --> 00:27:10,837
Keep moving, don't hold back.

428
00:27:11,087 --> 00:27:17,469
You and I, together
our hearts dance in sync.

429
00:27:17,886 --> 00:27:21,431
Follow the rhythm.

430
00:27:21,723 --> 00:27:25,352
Don't hold back.

431
00:27:25,477 --> 00:27:27,312
Don't quit.

432
00:27:27,729 --> 00:27:30,731
Move as one, to the beat
of our hearts, and dance.

433
00:27:30,732 --> 00:27:33,693
Move as one, move as one.

434
00:27:34,611 --> 00:27:38,490
Move as one, to the beat
of our hearts, and dance.

435
00:27:38,531 --> 00:27:41,493
Move as one, move as one.

436
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:46,122
Move as one, to the beat
of our hearts, and dance.

437
00:27:58,843 --> 00:28:00,260
I’m literally out of breath.

438
00:28:00,261 --> 00:28:03,014
We just finished the
Mutya girls’ production and

439
00:28:03,139 --> 00:28:05,350
oh my God, the energy
of the crowd is so high!

440
00:28:05,684 --> 00:28:08,019
I just want to jump, do a crowd dive.

441
00:28:08,728 --> 00:28:09,771
Rockstar, right?

442
00:28:09,854 --> 00:28:13,483
But seriously, it’s so much
fun, such a great feeling

443
00:28:13,608 --> 00:28:15,276
to see happy faces

444
00:28:15,301 --> 00:28:17,470
cheering for us while we dance.

445
00:28:17,737 --> 00:28:20,115
Because this performance
is not just for us.

446
00:28:20,281 --> 00:28:22,409
It’s for you, Section E Nation!

447
00:28:22,534 --> 00:28:26,162
And we just had the best
night of our lives thanks to you.

448
00:28:26,204 --> 00:28:29,541
We’re changing because
later we'll have our performance.

449
00:28:29,708 --> 00:28:33,086
We’re all changing
now, still really nervous.

450
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:34,545
But still pushing!

451
00:28:45,223 --> 00:28:48,476
Actually, this is my first
time going back to hosting,

452
00:28:48,518 --> 00:28:50,854
I’m super excited because I feel like

453
00:28:51,229 --> 00:28:53,189
I can connect with people,

454
00:28:53,231 --> 00:28:55,442
especially those supporting Mutya.

455
00:28:55,817 --> 00:28:57,986
They kind of know my humor already, so...

456
00:28:58,528 --> 00:29:00,447
there’s a lot you can expect from me.

457
00:29:00,530 --> 00:29:02,090
Oh my gosh, it's my first time hosting!

458
00:29:02,115 --> 00:29:03,700
Hopefully, it all goes well.

459
00:29:14,169 --> 00:29:18,256
Wow! New Frontier Theater, make some noise!

460
00:29:21,217 --> 00:29:24,304
First of all, let’s give it
up for the performers.

461
00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:27,348
Angela, Rafa, Sara, Jastine,

462
00:29:27,432 --> 00:29:29,309
the Mutya girls, and of course

463
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:31,478
hands down to the Mutya boys.

464
00:29:31,519 --> 00:29:36,274
Yanyan, Keagan, Frost,
Nic, Daniel, Martin, and Sam.

465
00:29:36,316 --> 00:29:38,193
Let’s give them a round of applause.

466
00:29:39,444 --> 00:29:41,946
And right now, we have a game together.

467
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:43,198
Are you ready for it?

468
00:29:44,157 --> 00:29:44,949
There you go!

469
00:29:45,074 --> 00:29:48,578
This game includes what we call

470
00:29:48,661 --> 00:29:52,457
the Sando boys and the Ulupong boys.

471
00:29:52,665 --> 00:29:56,336
Okay? First of all, I’m JD Axie,

472
00:29:56,419 --> 00:29:57,837
your segment host.

473
00:29:58,171 --> 00:30:00,396
And of course, with me is Heart.

474
00:30:00,548 --> 00:30:02,675
Heart Ryan!

475
00:30:02,759 --> 00:30:05,553
Hi, JD! Hello, everyone!

476
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:11,309
So, for the Sando boys, we have Zeke,

477
00:30:11,935 --> 00:30:14,103
Alex,

478
00:30:14,229 --> 00:30:14,938
Dan!

479
00:30:14,938 --> 00:30:15,688
Naz!

480
00:30:15,939 --> 00:30:17,398
Dan!

481
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:19,984
And Axel!

482
00:30:21,861 --> 00:30:23,321
Wait, wait, wait!

483
00:30:27,742 --> 00:30:30,636
- It's so loud!
- There’s more!

484
00:30:31,996 --> 00:30:33,039
Guys!

485
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:35,458
Calm down. Calm down.

486
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:37,794
And there’s more. Here it is.

487
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:41,108
For the Ulupong boys, we have Kyosu,

488
00:30:41,923 --> 00:30:43,216
there's Sam,

489
00:30:43,716 --> 00:30:48,263
AJ, Kurt, and Martin!

490
00:30:56,104 --> 00:30:57,605
So JD.

491
00:30:57,772 --> 00:31:00,650
What do we call our game?

492
00:31:00,775 --> 00:31:03,695
Okay guys, listen
carefully, this is important.

493
00:31:03,987 --> 00:31:10,326
This game is called the
no reaction game. Okay?

494
00:31:13,746 --> 00:31:15,456
Here’s how it goes.

495
00:31:15,623 --> 00:31:17,103
We have a portion for the Sando boys.

496
00:31:17,837 --> 00:31:20,309
The challenge is we have to sweet-talk,

497
00:31:21,170 --> 00:31:23,256
which I think is hard?

498
00:31:23,715 --> 00:31:27,302
But of course, if they
react, there’s a twist.

499
00:31:27,635 --> 00:31:29,238
It’s not just about making them feel giddy.

500
00:31:29,262 --> 00:31:31,973
So wait for that, and also,
we’re wearing tank tops.

501
00:31:32,891 --> 00:31:35,894
Get ready for our explosive pick-up lines

502
00:31:35,977 --> 00:31:39,022
because even if us,
we can't help but laugh.

503
00:31:39,439 --> 00:31:42,066
It’s so much fun, I really missed the cast.

504
00:31:42,108 --> 00:31:43,735
I really missed my friends.

505
00:31:44,152 --> 00:31:45,987
And I really don’t dance.

506
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:48,865
But now I'm dancing!

507
00:31:49,198 --> 00:31:50,783
I'm a dancer.

508
00:31:51,242 --> 00:31:52,452
Dancer, really?

509
00:31:52,535 --> 00:31:53,745
Do you want?

510
00:31:53,828 --> 00:31:54,828
Wow!

511
00:31:55,204 --> 00:31:56,204
Alright!

512
00:31:56,915 --> 00:31:58,041
Because you want it,

513
00:31:58,249 --> 00:32:01,294
before we explain the
mechanics, let’s call in the girls.

514
00:32:01,377 --> 00:32:04,380
- Yeah! Hello!
- Here are our lucky participants.

515
00:32:04,964 --> 00:32:06,925
Guys, go to your partners.

516
00:32:06,966 --> 00:32:07,383
Okay.

517
00:32:07,384 --> 00:32:10,094
So now that we have our ten pairs here,

518
00:32:10,303 --> 00:32:12,013
- this is what will happen.
- What’s that?

519
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:15,224
One by one, the boys
need to make an effort.

520
00:32:15,308 --> 00:32:19,979
They can do cute poses, sweet
gestures, or say sweet words.

521
00:32:20,229 --> 00:32:21,481
Simple right?

522
00:32:21,789 --> 00:32:23,207
But here's the catch.

523
00:32:23,232 --> 00:32:27,153
If the girl reacts, both of them lose.

524
00:32:28,029 --> 00:32:29,340
Because it's a no reaction challenge.

525
00:32:29,364 --> 00:32:32,033
That’s right, you got it! They can't react.

526
00:32:32,116 --> 00:32:34,661
Because if they do, even just a little,

527
00:32:34,786 --> 00:32:36,537
they’re eliminated.

528
00:32:36,829 --> 00:32:40,124
Also, each pair only has ten seconds.

529
00:32:40,708 --> 00:32:44,896
Let’s start! The first pair
is Zeke and his partner.

530
00:32:45,338 --> 00:32:46,798
Okay, are you ready?

531
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:48,257
- Okay?
- Wait, wait.

532
00:32:48,299 --> 00:32:49,342
- Wait.
- What?

533
00:32:49,384 --> 00:32:50,802
Can you hold this for me?

534
00:32:51,052 --> 00:32:52,887
Just hold this.

535
00:32:53,262 --> 00:32:54,262
Ah!

536
00:32:56,015 --> 00:32:58,059
This guy is too cocky!

537
00:32:58,893 --> 00:33:00,478
- There’s no timer yet.
- Yeah!

538
00:33:00,603 --> 00:33:01,895
No timer yet.

539
00:33:01,896 --> 00:33:03,606
Okay, are you ready?

540
00:33:04,065 --> 00:33:04,774
Okay!

541
00:33:04,899 --> 00:33:08,152
Your timer starts now!

542
00:33:08,361 --> 00:33:11,406
Zyra, I proposed to Mica but...

543
00:33:11,823 --> 00:33:13,449
I think I got rejected.

544
00:33:13,658 --> 00:33:14,826
But when I saw you,

545
00:33:15,368 --> 00:33:17,996
I think I just want you instead.

546
00:33:20,206 --> 00:33:21,416
Was if effective?

547
00:33:21,791 --> 00:33:22,792
Were you affected, Miss?

548
00:33:23,334 --> 00:33:25,378
- Oh, passed! Passed!
- Sorry, Zeke!

549
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:27,005
Sorry Zeke!
- Nice try!

550
00:33:27,755 --> 00:33:30,091
- Thank you so much.
- Here we go. Okay!

551
00:33:30,216 --> 00:33:34,053
- Who's next?
- Our next up... is Alex!

552
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:38,390
Alex!

553
00:33:42,854 --> 00:33:44,564
These guys are so cocky!

554
00:33:45,064 --> 00:33:46,064
Oh my!

555
00:33:48,693 --> 00:33:49,693
Okay, wait!

556
00:33:49,902 --> 00:33:52,947
Timer starts now!

557
00:33:55,992 --> 00:33:56,992
Are you the sun?

558
00:33:58,995 --> 00:34:02,498
My world is bright when you’re around.

559
00:34:05,543 --> 00:34:07,544
- You’re so good!
- Really good!

560
00:34:07,545 --> 00:34:08,671
You're so good!

561
00:34:09,255 --> 00:34:10,048
Sorry, sorry.

562
00:34:10,089 --> 00:34:11,966
Sorry, next.

563
00:34:12,383 --> 00:34:14,385
Naz, you’re next!

564
00:34:14,469 --> 00:34:15,470
Naz!

565
00:34:15,803 --> 00:34:16,804
- Oh!
- Oh!

566
00:34:18,264 --> 00:34:20,223
Sando boys are really something, huh?

567
00:34:20,224 --> 00:34:21,308
They're really wearing tank tops!

568
00:34:21,309 --> 00:34:22,309
Yeah.

569
00:34:22,643 --> 00:34:23,643
Whoa!

570
00:34:26,213 --> 00:34:28,507
If I were there, I
probably couldn’t handle it!

571
00:34:28,532 --> 00:34:30,492
Naz, you’re something else.

572
00:34:31,486 --> 00:34:32,862
Naz, are you ready?

573
00:34:32,904 --> 00:34:33,571
Yes.

574
00:34:33,613 --> 00:34:36,574
Okay, timer starts now!

575
00:34:36,657 --> 00:34:40,139
Look, with so many people here,

576
00:34:41,162 --> 00:34:43,122
it’s still you I will choose.

577
00:34:47,627 --> 00:34:49,253
Oh no!

578
00:34:49,545 --> 00:34:52,048
Thank you so much.
- Thank you, next please.

579
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:53,341
It's Dan.

580
00:34:54,467 --> 00:34:55,593
Dan, come here.

581
00:34:57,178 --> 00:34:58,930
Okay Dan, if you’re ready,

582
00:34:59,222 --> 00:35:02,225
your timer starts now! Now!

583
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:05,520
You know, I cherish this ring.
It has “keep” written on it.

584
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:08,106
You can keep it, and me too.

585
00:35:11,984 --> 00:35:14,153
Wow! They're so strong.

586
00:35:14,195 --> 00:35:15,988
- Strong heart!
- Yeah!

587
00:35:16,531 --> 00:35:19,075
Sorry, Dan. Next pair please.

588
00:35:19,659 --> 00:35:22,078
Everyone's afraid of this one.

589
00:35:23,329 --> 00:35:26,082
Angelo... Axel!

590
00:35:26,582 --> 00:35:28,042
Axel!

591
00:35:28,459 --> 00:35:29,585
Come here.

592
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:33,630
Okay.

593
00:35:34,173 --> 00:35:35,591
- Ready?
- Ready?

594
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:39,720
Okay, timer starts now!

595
00:35:39,846 --> 00:35:41,639
Who’s that? Do you know them?

596
00:35:50,648 --> 00:35:52,399
Nothing. That’s amazing!

597
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:53,192
- Nothing!
- Nothing.

598
00:35:53,217 --> 00:35:54,217
Awesome!

599
00:35:54,258 --> 00:35:55,258
Amazing!

600
00:35:55,283 --> 00:35:57,414
Epic. Okay. Guys, thank you.

601
00:35:58,072 --> 00:35:59,407
Let’s move on.

602
00:36:00,032 --> 00:36:01,576
The “Ulupong” boys!

603
00:36:01,617 --> 00:36:02,617
Yes!

604
00:36:02,827 --> 00:36:04,078

Wait,

608
00:36:19,343 --> 00:36:21,345
When I saw you, I was stunned.

609
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:23,430
How?

610
00:36:26,517 --> 00:36:28,213
A bit good though, Sam.

611
00:36:28,686 --> 00:36:29,729
Damn!

612
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:34,275

00:36:39,488 --> 00:36:40,488
Already ready.

618
00:36:40,708 --> 00:36:43,127

619
00:36:43,868 --> 00:36:44,868
Hello, um...

620
00:36:46,329 --> 00:36:47,496

00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:48,164
Yana.

622
00:36:48,497 --> 00:36:49,248

00:36:50,249 --> 00:36:53,544
Yana. Yana, I just want to say I love you.

625
00:36:54,879 --> 00:36:58,758
What was that? You didn’t
reach the message, too bad.

626
00:36:59,204 --> 00:37:00,789
Thank you so much. Okay, next!

Let it out, Kurt! Timer starts now!

641
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:38,172
I want you to pull this, okay?

642
00:37:48,057 --> 00:37:50,475
What are you doing?
That’s not how I taught you.

643
00:37:50,476 --> 00:37:52,061
It’s a surprise.

644
00:37:52,144 --> 00:37:54,164
Oh, sorry, sorry You’re scaring
her, Kurt, you’re scaring her.

645
00:37:54,188 --> 00:37:57,333
- What is this? Okay, enough. You guys stop.
-There’s choreography for this.

646
00:37:57,358 --> 00:37:58,838
Did you get giddy? Kind of got giddy.

647
00:37:59,037 --> 00:38:00,646
- No!
- Oh, no? Okay, okay.

648
00:38:00,671 --> 00:38:01,671
Are you sure?

649
00:38:01,696 --> 00:38:02,613
Okay, back!

650
00:38:02,710 --> 00:38:04,628
This is the last one, last one.

651
00:38:05,182 --> 00:38:06,963
This is also my idol, Martin.

652
00:38:08,157 --> 00:38:11,451
Ready? Okay, timer starts now!

653
00:38:11,476 --> 00:38:12,602

Why?

655
00:38:14,215 --> 00:38:20,006
Because no matter what I
do, you’re the fault. Why?

656
00:38:20,047 --> 00:38:23,283
So many things to say, promise me.

657
00:38:24,385 --> 00:38:25,678
You smiled!

658
00:38:26,137 --> 00:38:28,930
She’s not smiling, no win for us.

659
00:38:29,031 --> 00:38:31,117
- It’s like you don’t want to get giddy
- we won!

660
00:38:31,142 --> 00:38:32,977
Wow, how come everyone wins?

Okay, since everyone won,
congratulations to all of you.

662
00:38:37,523 --> 00:38:40,526
Let’s take a picture together!

663
00:38:40,943 --> 00:38:44,863
It’s hard to make someone giddy; The time
is so short, but oh well, that’s how it is.

664
00:38:44,864 --> 00:38:46,490
My partner is really good at this.

665
00:38:46,907 --> 00:38:48,867
Super enjoyable, wow!

667
00:38:53,039 --> 00:38:53,247
But making someone giddy is hard!
And the fans’ support is amazing, so solid.

668
00:38:53,248 --> 00:38:55,415
But making someone giddy is hard!

669
00:38:55,416 --> 00:39:01,254
Guys, it was so fun because the cheering
was so loud I couldn’t hear my own voice.

670
00:39:01,255 --> 00:39:03,757
So, thank you very
much, we really enjoyed it.

671
00:39:03,758 --> 00:39:06,760
It’s not over yet, there’s
more, so watch out.

672
00:39:06,761 --> 00:39:09,764
- So lets compress together to take a picture

673
00:39:12,141 --> 00:39:15,311

676
00:39:28,407 --> 00:39:29,909
Thank you, everyone!

677
00:39:35,873 --> 00:39:40,043
Wow, JD, that game was
kind of challenging, right JD?

678
00:39:40,044 --> 00:39:43,046
True, sorry I got distracted.

679
00:39:43,047 --> 00:39:47,592
Because how can you not get giddy
with the sando boys and ulupong boys?

680
00:39:47,593 --> 00:39:52,263
Right? Anyone in a tank top
would make you giddy, right?

681
00:39:52,264 --> 00:39:55,094
Yes, it’s true, but
before anything else

682
00:39:55,119 --> 00:39:58,770
section E nation would like
to thank our major sponsors.

Come here!

686
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:11,128
But I believe this is just the
start of the giddiness because

687
00:40:11,152 --> 00:40:16,421
the whole New Frontier Theater
is ready to get giddy, right?

688
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:21,751
Guys, our next performer, one of his songs

Guys, let’s make some noise for Amiel Sol!

691
00:41:09,499 --> 00:41:12,852
This first song is called "Ikaw Lang
Patutunguhan" .

692
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:36,785
Loss again.

693
00:41:38,454 --> 00:41:43,083
Loss again.

694
00:41:45,336 --> 00:41:51,717
I’m guided by the stars.

695
00:41:52,927 --> 00:41:55,804
To you.

696
00:41:56,269 --> 00:42:02,567
Wherever I sail.

697
00:42:05,022 --> 00:42:10,819
You’re the only destination.

698
00:42:11,362 --> 00:42:16,199
And when I arrive.

699
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:19,202
To you alone.

700
00:42:19,203 --> 00:42:22,206
I’ll say.

701
00:42:24,833 --> 00:42:31,756
How lucky you are.

702
00:42:31,757 --> 00:42:38,096
To be with me under the moon.

703
00:42:38,097 --> 00:42:44,395
And how happy you are.

704
00:42:46,063 --> 00:42:51,526
To be beside me at sunrise.

705
00:42:51,527 --> 00:42:59,527
Oh oh hm.

706
00:43:04,999 --> 00:43:10,920
Won’t disappear.

707
00:43:10,921 --> 00:43:15,759
The sky will guide me.

708
00:43:17,928 --> 00:43:21,431
Feeling the longing.

709
00:43:21,432 --> 00:43:29,432
I’m coming closer, my dear.

710
00:43:30,566 --> 00:43:34,778
Dusk is near.

711
00:43:37,406 --> 00:43:44,412
And it feels so good to come home to you.

712
00:43:44,413 --> 00:43:47,415
So every night

713
00:43:47,416 --> 00:43:51,836
I pray.

714
00:43:51,837 --> 00:43:56,382
Because.

715
00:43:56,383 --> 00:44:04,383
How lucky you are.

716
00:44:04,558 --> 00:44:11,022
To be with me under the moon.

717
00:44:11,023 --> 00:44:18,529
And how happy you are.

718
00:44:18,530 --> 00:44:24,327
To be beside me at sunrise.

719
00:44:24,328 --> 00:44:32,328
Oh oh.

720
00:44:49,061 --> 00:44:54,108
Wherever I sail.

721
00:44:57,444 --> 00:45:01,907
You’re the only destination.

722
00:45:03,826 --> 00:45:07,329
Wherever I sail.

723
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:15,838
You’re the only destination.

724
00:45:17,798 --> 00:45:21,635
Sa'n man Wherever I sail.

725
00:45:23,762 --> 00:45:28,434
You’re the only destination.

726
00:45:29,893 --> 00:45:34,857
Wherever I sail.

727
00:45:37,067 --> 00:45:43,614
You’re the only destination.

728
00:45:43,615 --> 00:45:47,536
Wherever I sail.

729
00:45:50,539 --> 00:45:56,961
You’re the only destination.

730
00:45:56,962 --> 00:45:59,965
And when I arrive.

731
00:46:01,925 --> 00:46:08,015
To you alone I’ll say.

732
00:46:10,058 --> 00:46:16,732
How lucky you are.

733
00:46:18,442 --> 00:46:23,362
To be with me through the passing waves.

734
00:46:23,363 --> 00:46:31,363
And how happy I am to be with you.

735
00:46:45,761 --> 00:46:47,721
Good evening everyone,

736
00:46:48,096 --> 00:46:50,723
I’m Amiel Sol.

737
00:46:50,724 --> 00:46:53,727
And before I continue to my next song.

738
00:46:55,395 --> 00:46:58,064
I'd like to thank everyone for being here,

739
00:46:58,065 --> 00:47:02,276
Thank you so much to Ang Mutya
ng Section E for featuring my songs.

740
00:47:02,277 --> 00:47:04,530
And you probably already
know what my next song is.

741
00:47:06,782 --> 00:47:09,450
But before I continue, I
also want to share with you.

742
00:47:09,451 --> 00:47:11,994
That I’m here with G-A-T,

743
00:47:11,995 --> 00:47:14,205
Earl Agustin and Rob Deniel.

744
00:47:14,206 --> 00:47:16,499
For the Mutya OST live concert.

745
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:20,461
Right here at the New Frontier
Theater on June 20, 2025.

746
00:47:20,462 --> 00:47:24,924
Hope we get to meet there, in case you
want more from our performances tonight.

747
00:47:24,925 --> 00:47:27,176
We’ll definitely be
singing a lot more there.

748
00:47:27,177 --> 00:47:28,971
Now for my last song,

749
00:47:30,389 --> 00:47:35,102
This is a song for our rest.

750
00:48:10,846 --> 00:48:14,390
When the world is chaotic.

751
00:48:14,391 --> 00:48:20,272
You’re the peace I’m searching for.

752
00:48:24,964 --> 00:48:33,768
My heart is pounding again.

753
00:48:36,204 --> 00:48:42,043
With the worries.

754
00:48:42,490 --> 00:48:48,454
That the world brings.

755
00:48:53,430 --> 00:48:58,727
With so much happening.

756
00:49:00,646 --> 00:49:03,941
Where else can I turn?

757
00:49:06,693 --> 00:49:10,363
But to you.

758
00:49:10,364 --> 00:49:17,411
Only you I’ll hold on to.

759
00:49:17,412 --> 00:49:20,414
NFT, let’s sing this together.

760
00:49:20,415 --> 00:49:23,960
When the world is chaotic.

761
00:49:23,961 --> 00:49:31,301
You’re the peace I’m searching for.

762
00:49:34,304 --> 00:49:38,182
Run to me too.

763
00:49:38,183 --> 00:49:45,064
When your heart feels heavy.

764
00:49:45,065 --> 00:49:51,405
I’ll be there to welcome you.

765
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:58,954
Ooohh.

766
00:50:03,375 --> 00:50:05,210
I want to.

767
00:50:06,545 --> 00:50:11,758
Bloom with you.

768
00:50:16,263 --> 00:50:24,263
And let’s glance at our future.

769
00:50:30,819 --> 00:50:38,819
You’re the only one, my rest.

770
00:50:40,996 --> 00:50:46,918
With you I’m awake.

771
00:50:47,586 --> 00:50:50,129
Until I sleep.

772
00:50:50,130 --> 00:50:58,054
With you, my world keeps spinning.

773
00:50:58,055 --> 00:51:01,057
When the world is chaotic.

774
00:51:01,058 --> 00:51:08,648
You’re the peace I’m searching for.

775
00:51:11,693 --> 00:51:15,446
Run to me too.

776
00:51:15,447 --> 00:51:22,662
When your heart feels heavy.

777
00:51:25,665 --> 00:51:29,460
You’re part of every prayer.

778
00:51:29,461 --> 00:51:35,383
You’re the rest in every moment.

779
00:51:39,971 --> 00:51:43,432
My voice is heading to you.

780
00:51:43,433 --> 00:51:49,439
And the beat only says one thing.

781
00:51:51,024 --> 00:51:57,404
I’ll be there to welcome you.

782
00:51:57,405 --> 00:52:04,079
Ooohh.

783
00:52:08,333 --> 00:52:16,333
Ooohh.

784
00:52:35,402 --> 00:52:43,402
Oooh.

785
00:52:48,957 --> 00:52:52,710
When the world is chaotic.

786
00:52:52,711 --> 00:52:58,925
You’re the peace I’m searching for.

787
00:53:03,054 --> 00:53:07,016
Run to me too.

788
00:53:07,017 --> 00:53:13,815
When your heart feels heavy.

789
00:53:16,526 --> 00:53:22,490
With just one glance from you.

790
00:53:24,242 --> 00:53:30,372
It’s like you’re hugging me.

791
00:53:30,373 --> 00:53:36,338
And the world feels lighter.

792
00:53:40,759 --> 00:53:45,055
Thank you so much everyone,
Once again, I’m Amiel Sol.

793
00:53:57,275 --> 00:54:02,530
With Leo, Pedro, Joseph, Mark
— Thank you so much everyone.

794
00:54:16,461 --> 00:54:17,963
Thank you everyone.

795
00:54:18,755 --> 00:54:23,259
I’m so happy, really happy to perform
for the fans of Mutya ng Section E.

796
00:54:23,260 --> 00:54:26,971
Super thankful to both
the fans of Section E.

797
00:54:26,972 --> 00:54:31,809
And to... Ashtine because you
really lifted this song to great heights.

798
00:54:31,810 --> 00:54:34,813
Something I never imagined would happen.

799
00:54:36,731 --> 00:54:40,735
Woo hoo Amiel Sol in the House!

800
00:54:41,528 --> 00:54:43,954
Did you all like that?

801
00:54:44,054 --> 00:54:46,741
Did everyone get chills?

802
00:54:47,242 --> 00:54:51,912
Seriously, you know, I just want
to use this opportunity to say that.

803
00:54:51,913 --> 00:54:56,083
All of us from Luzon,
Visayas, Mindanao, individually.

804
00:54:56,084 --> 00:54:58,752
We have broken pieces in our lives.

805
00:54:58,753 --> 00:55:02,589
And I’m just so happy
that Mutya ng Section E.

806
00:55:02,590 --> 00:55:04,883
Is our therapy.

807
00:55:04,884 --> 00:55:06,135
Admit it, right?

808
00:55:06,136 --> 00:55:10,514
We all came together tonight to use
this as therapy for our broken parts.

809
00:55:10,539 --> 00:55:16,008
So the whole New Frontier
Theater finally settled down.

810
00:55:16,033 --> 00:55:18,689
Because of the songs
of my brother, Amiel Sol.

811
00:55:18,690 --> 00:55:22,985
Hi guys, again I’m CJ Villavicencio
reporting for duty tonight.

812
00:55:22,986 --> 00:55:28,240
And I’m just here now because
we have a special game with

813
00:55:28,241 --> 00:55:30,534
all our “chickens”

814
00:55:30,559 --> 00:55:32,329
Guess who,

815
00:55:33,663 --> 00:55:34,664
who?

816
00:55:35,332 --> 00:55:39,209
Let's call on stage Yuri
from Ang Mutya ng Section E,

817
00:55:39,210 --> 00:55:42,213
Rabin Angeles.

818
00:55:43,214 --> 00:55:45,215
Hello guys.

819
00:55:45,216 --> 00:55:48,218
Rabin!

820
00:55:48,219 --> 00:55:50,596
Yey!

821
00:55:50,597 --> 00:55:52,264
Woo hoo,

822
00:55:52,265 --> 00:55:55,226
this guy is so handsome.

823
00:55:55,935 --> 00:55:57,728
You’re the handsome one.

824
00:55:57,729 --> 00:55:59,980
Wow Rabin, here we go

825
00:55:59,981 --> 00:56:03,234
I know you’re ready, and you’ve
prepared for a long time because

826
00:56:03,818 --> 00:56:07,488
this game is special, you
have teammates here, but first

827
00:56:07,489 --> 00:56:11,325
let’s call our teammates on stage.

828
00:56:11,326 --> 00:56:12,243
Where are they?

829
00:56:12,244 --> 00:56:15,829
We have five participants for this
game, come on down guys, come on down.

830
00:56:15,830 --> 00:56:18,832
Hello! Let’s know their names.

831
00:56:18,833 --> 00:56:20,459
Hello!

832
00:56:20,460 --> 00:56:21,460

833
00:56:21,461 --> 00:56:23,253
These guys are excited.

834
00:56:23,254 --> 00:56:25,631
Wow the cheeks are so glittery.

835
00:56:25,632 --> 00:56:26,132
Too much.

836
00:56:26,133 --> 00:56:27,758
Ahh dazzling,

837
00:56:27,759 --> 00:56:28,967
Yes indeed,

838
00:56:28,968 --> 00:56:31,970
Alright guys come closer, come
closer, let’s go, let’s go, let’s go.

839
00:56:31,971 --> 00:56:33,055
Why are you backing away?

840
00:56:33,056 --> 00:56:34,974
That’s Rabin right there.

841
00:56:35,725 --> 00:56:37,976
Okay, okay, okay, here we
go, here we go, here we go,

842
00:56:37,977 --> 00:56:40,979
So what’s your name before we start?

843
00:56:40,980 --> 00:56:41,980
Elle

844
00:56:41,981 --> 00:56:44,233
Elle, oh okay, co-host.

845
00:56:44,234 --> 00:56:45,275
What’s her name?

846
00:56:45,276 --> 00:56:47,486
What’s your name before we start?

847
00:56:47,487 --> 00:56:50,072
Mary.

848
00:56:50,073 --> 00:56:50,865
Jessa.

849
00:56:50,866 --> 00:56:52,825
What’s your name before we start?

850
00:56:52,826 --> 00:56:53,535
Maria.

851
00:56:53,535 --> 00:56:54,244
You?

852
00:56:54,244 --> 00:56:55,244
Miel

853
00:56:55,495 --> 00:56:56,162
okay.

854
00:56:56,163 --> 00:56:57,830
Alright, alright, alright,

855
00:56:57,831 --> 00:56:59,081
Clear, clear, clear.

856
00:56:59,082 --> 00:57:00,833
Rabin, are you ready?

857
00:57:00,834 --> 00:57:01,834
They’re ready already.

858
00:57:01,835 --> 00:57:02,752
Are you ready?

859
00:57:03,546 --> 00:57:05,212
Will I get butterflies
there?

860
00:57:06,107 --> 00:57:07,631
This is what’s going to happen,

861
00:57:07,632 --> 00:57:10,634
each participant here now

862
00:57:10,635 --> 00:57:14,847
will deliver a pick-up line for Rabin.

863
00:57:14,848 --> 00:57:19,435
Earlier the boys delivered
pick-up lines to the fans.

864
00:57:19,436 --> 00:57:20,936
Now it’s the other way around.

865
00:57:20,937 --> 00:57:24,231
You will be the ones
giving pick-up lines to Rabin.

866
00:57:24,232 --> 00:57:26,692
But not just that.

867
00:57:26,693 --> 00:57:32,656
The pick-up line must
have the word “Bin” in it.

868
00:57:32,657 --> 00:57:34,783
Like Bin perfume.

869
00:57:34,784 --> 00:57:36,430
Yup yup yup, correct.

870
00:57:36,577 --> 00:57:38,495
It’s that simple guys, so girls.

871
00:57:38,496 --> 00:57:40,456
Here, there’s a lot of people.

872
00:57:40,457 --> 00:57:44,084
Let’s be witty and wholesome,
no funny business, okay?

873
00:57:44,085 --> 00:57:47,087
Nothing reportable.

874
00:57:47,088 --> 00:57:51,842
Alright, let’s see who
can make Rabin swoon.

875
00:57:51,843 --> 00:57:55,371
Okay, after everyone
finishes giving their pick-up line.

876
00:57:55,555 --> 00:57:59,558
You Rabin and the whole
New Frontier Theater

877
00:57:59,559 --> 00:58:02,561
will decide by applause

878
00:58:02,562 --> 00:58:05,564
and cheers who wins.

879
00:58:05,565 --> 00:58:06,191
Let’s go.

880
00:58:06,192 --> 00:58:08,609
Clear? And the
winner will have a photo

881
00:58:08,633 --> 00:58:12,212
opportunity of course with
our very handsome Rabin.

882
00:58:12,237 --> 00:58:17,549
Pick lipstick by Pops Fernandez.
Let’s give a round of applause guys.

883
00:58:17,936 --> 00:58:21,663
We all love pick cosmetics,
The Lab by Blanc Doux.

884
00:58:21,664 --> 00:58:26,335
And of course the very fragrant scent,
promise take it from me, BIN perfume.

885
00:58:26,336 --> 00:58:26,836
Bin perfume.

886
00:58:26,837 --> 00:58:29,421
We smelled that, bro,
you know that smells good.

887
00:58:29,422 --> 00:58:30,547
Yes, you know that CJ.

888
00:58:30,548 --> 00:58:32,132
So let’s start with our first...

889
00:58:32,133 --> 00:58:33,592
Alright, let’s start here first.

890
00:58:33,593 --> 00:58:35,093
Kind of…

891
00:58:35,434 --> 00:58:38,096
Are you going to the back?
Want me to escort you…

892
00:58:38,097 --> 00:58:41,642
Okay, let’s extend a bit,
extend, extend, thanks.

893
00:58:41,643 --> 00:58:42,754
There, there.

894
00:58:43,067 --> 00:58:45,437
So Rabin, you stay in front.

895
00:58:45,438 --> 00:58:46,772
I’ll sit down. I’ll sit down.

896
00:58:46,773 --> 00:58:48,649
Alright, alright, alright.
I like that, I like that.

897
00:58:48,650 --> 00:58:50,484
One by one, we’ll approach Rabin and then

898
00:58:50,485 --> 00:58:52,194
we’ll drop the pick-up line, okay?

899
00:58:52,195 --> 00:58:54,154
Okay, just act naturally.

900
00:58:54,155 --> 00:58:57,157
Okay. You go first. Because
you’re wearing… blue.

901
00:58:57,158 --> 00:58:59,243
No reason. Wow. So random.

902
00:58:59,244 --> 00:59:00,327
Alright. What’s your name?

903
00:59:00,328 --> 00:59:00,954
Miel.

904
00:59:00,954 --> 00:59:01,829
Miel, Ok.

905
00:59:01,830 --> 00:59:03,497
Alright, go ahead…

906
00:59:04,599 --> 00:59:05,458
Rabin...

907
00:59:05,959 --> 00:59:06,793
Yes?

908
00:59:06,794 --> 00:59:08,168
Are you a Bin?

909
00:59:08,169 --> 00:59:08,795
Why?

910
00:59:08,796 --> 00:59:11,046
I’m not good at gambling.

911
00:59:11,047 --> 00:59:13,006
But. With the letter B,

912
00:59:13,007 --> 00:59:14,633
I’m a bingo for you

913
00:59:14,634 --> 00:59:17,637
and you’re a BINgo for me.

914
00:59:24,394 --> 00:59:26,103
Is that okay?

915
00:59:26,104 --> 00:59:27,729
Are you okay there? Are you happy there?

916
00:59:27,730 --> 00:59:28,815
Alright.

917
00:59:29,357 --> 00:59:33,110
Hold on, hold on. Now here
we go. Here we go. Rararara.

918
00:59:33,111 --> 00:59:35,487
Alright, here’s the microphone.

919
00:59:35,981 --> 00:59:37,322
Rabin!

920
00:59:37,323 --> 00:59:38,491
Yes.

921
00:59:39,325 --> 00:59:40,325
Are you “Bin”?

922
00:59:40,326 --> 00:59:41,244
Why?

923
00:59:41,245 --> 00:59:44,246
Because even though
many guys got bingo on me,

924
00:59:44,500 --> 00:59:47,503
Lord gave you to me.

925
00:59:52,439 --> 00:59:53,606
Wow, really.

926
00:59:53,631 --> 00:59:55,340
That’s really something.

927
00:59:55,341 --> 00:59:57,260
Feels like it’s true to life, huh.

928
00:59:57,844 --> 01:00:00,238
What’s that? Earrings? Oh, they fell off.

929
01:00:00,576 --> 01:00:01,597
Ah, he proposed.

930
01:00:01,598 --> 01:00:04,182
He has props, Rabin, he said you
should do it so you’ll show up on camera.

931
01:00:04,183 --> 01:00:06,059
So the audience can see you.

932
01:00:06,060 --> 01:00:07,894
Wow, that shout.

933
01:00:07,895 --> 01:00:10,648
Okay, next is Ate here.

934
01:00:11,065 --> 01:00:12,441
Rabin, come here to the middle.

935
01:00:12,442 --> 01:00:14,611
Alright, drop your pick-up line now.

936
01:00:15,361 --> 01:00:17,613
Oh no, not yet, not yet.

937
01:00:17,614 --> 01:00:19,448
Isn’t it the other way around?
You’re supposed to make Rabin swoon.

938
01:00:19,449 --> 01:00:20,366
Why did it become.

939
01:00:20,367 --> 01:00:22,034
I’m not allowed to be swept off my feet

940
01:00:22,035 --> 01:00:24,616
I'll go! One two three.

941
01:00:25,038 --> 01:00:27,456
Rabin, are you “Bin”?

942
01:00:27,457 --> 01:00:28,457
Why?

943
01:00:28,875 --> 01:00:30,959
Because when I met you,

944
01:00:31,107 --> 01:00:34,691
you gave life meaning to me.

945
01:00:36,257 --> 01:00:37,941
Enough already, enough
already, enough already.

946
01:00:39,844 --> 01:00:43,013
You’re amazing, you’re amazing.

947
01:00:43,014 --> 01:00:47,601
Bonus.

948
01:00:47,602 --> 01:00:49,311
Okay, next next next.

949
01:00:49,312 --> 01:00:50,479
Your turn, your turn.

950
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:51,230
Here it is, here it is, here it is.

951
01:00:51,231 --> 01:00:54,232
Rabin, share the microphone
so it’ll be more swoon-worthy.

952
01:00:54,233 --> 01:00:56,276
Your turn, One two three.

953
01:00:56,277 --> 01:00:57,527
Rabin.

954
01:00:57,528 --> 01:00:58,528
Yes.

955
01:00:59,364 --> 01:01:00,405
Why?

956
01:01:00,559 --> 01:01:03,979
Because your mom entrusted you to me.

957
01:01:08,956 --> 01:01:11,626
Oh, really.

958
01:01:11,959 --> 01:01:13,919
Because your mom bought you to me.

959
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:15,253
To me, yes.

960
01:01:15,254 --> 01:01:16,755
You have a mom.

961
01:01:16,756 --> 01:01:18,924
Your mom.

962
01:01:18,925 --> 01:01:20,175
There’s my mom right there.

963
01:01:20,176 --> 01:01:21,843
There, there, hello.

964
01:01:21,844 --> 01:01:23,553
Thank you so much, enjoy, auntie.

965
01:01:23,554 --> 01:01:24,680
Right, next.

966
01:01:24,681 --> 01:01:26,264
Last but not least— Oh, share the...

967
01:01:26,265 --> 01:01:26,641
There, there, there Last
but not least— Oh, share the...

968
01:01:26,641 --> 01:01:26,974
There, there, there.

969
01:01:26,975 --> 01:01:28,183
Share the microphone.

970
01:01:28,184 --> 01:01:30,352
Let’s share, let’s share, let’s share.

971
01:01:30,353 --> 01:01:31,645
Come on.

972
01:01:31,646 --> 01:01:32,188
Okay.

973
01:01:32,189 --> 01:01:33,523
One two three, go.

974
01:01:34,065 --> 01:01:35,524
You know Rabin

975
01:01:35,525 --> 01:01:37,442
I wish you were “Bin” already.

976
01:01:37,443 --> 01:01:38,860
Why?

977
01:01:38,861 --> 01:01:40,570
Because I want you to

978
01:01:40,571 --> 01:01:43,573
give me a new name

979
01:01:43,574 --> 01:01:45,826
I'm yours, by the way.

980
01:01:45,986 --> 01:01:47,194
Whoa

981
01:01:47,499 --> 01:01:52,165
I got nervous there.

982
01:01:52,166 --> 01:01:55,168
Like, oh my God my neck hurts.

983
01:01:55,169 --> 01:01:57,713
And the song was like that.

984
01:01:57,714 --> 01:01:59,465
Wholesome.

985
01:02:01,134 --> 01:02:02,926
It hurts.. Maybe...

986
01:02:02,927 --> 01:02:04,470
Let me stretch first.

987
01:02:04,846 --> 01:02:06,138
But there you go.

988
01:02:06,139 --> 01:02:10,726
We’ve heard the pick-up lines
of our beautiful Latinas here.

989
01:02:10,727 --> 01:02:11,436
Alright.

990
01:02:11,837 --> 01:02:15,564
Rabin and New Frontier,
we need to decide now.

991
01:02:15,565 --> 01:02:16,898

How many was that? How
many? How many? How many?

1003
01:02:50,767 --> 01:02:51,767
I don’t know

1004

01:02:55,334 --> 01:02:57,565
Alright contender number 4.

Wow.

1007

So, what was your pick-up line again?

1008
01:03:05,239 --> 01:03:07,324
Rabin are you “Bin”?

1009
01:03:07,325 --> 01:03:07,950
Why.

1010
01:03:07,951 --> 01:03:11,453
Because you’re the one
your mom picked for me.

1011
01:03:11,454 --> 01:03:13,413
Whoa.

1012
01:03:13,957 --> 01:03:18,001
Wow Mrs. Angeles is
even at the back of her shirt.

Wow.

This is hard.

1019
01:03:33,935 --> 01:03:36,937
Okay, you’ve heard the
pulse of New Frontier Theater.

1020
01:03:36,938 --> 01:03:39,940
Yes it’s time for you.

1021
01:03:39,941 --> 01:03:41,399
This is nerve-wracking.

1022
01:03:41,400 --> 01:03:44,195
- I’ll choose.
- It’s time for you to decide Rabin.

1023
01:03:44,743 --> 01:03:47,150
Who among them will you choose?

1024
01:03:47,175 --> 01:03:48,074
Who made you swoon?

1025
01:03:48,099 --> 01:03:52,182
Wait one more, one more, one more,
one more, one more, one more, one more.

Last one.

1033
01:04:16,435 --> 01:04:17,061
Sorry.

1034
01:04:17,062 --> 01:04:20,063
Are you thinking what I’m thinking?

1035
01:04:20,064 --> 01:04:21,648
It’s probably her.

1036
01:04:21,649 --> 01:04:25,277
It’s probably her— Congratulations!

1037
01:04:25,278 --> 01:04:28,697

Thank you. Thank you, thank you. Bye-bye.

1054
01:05:15,363 --> 01:05:16,663
Oh my gosh.

1055
01:05:18,706 --> 01:05:20,957
Alright. Rabin, seems like
you have something to say.

1056
01:05:20,958 --> 01:05:23,335
Seems like there’s Bin
perfume in the lobby.

1057
01:05:23,336 --> 01:05:25,795
There’s Bin perfume there, right?

1058
01:05:25,796 --> 01:05:27,882
I’ll see you later, brother.
Tell them your story.

1059
01:05:29,175 --> 01:05:30,884
How are you guys?

1060
01:05:30,885 --> 01:05:33,303
There it is! There it is!

1061
01:05:33,304 --> 01:05:34,555
Do you like it?

1062
01:05:36,265 --> 01:05:38,391
Okay! Amazing!

1063
01:05:38,392 --> 01:05:42,355
Is everyone overwhelmed with
the pick-up lines with Rabin?

1064
01:05:44,398 --> 01:05:48,276
Hey, I can really feel your
excitement all the way here on stage.

1065
01:05:48,277 --> 01:05:52,238
But you Rabin, how about
the contestants’ entries earlier?

1066
01:05:52,239 --> 01:05:55,241
Okay. My heart almost couldn’t take it.

1067
01:05:55,242 --> 01:05:58,244
A bit left wanting more
though. How about you, Ashtine?

1068
01:05:58,245 --> 01:06:00,455
Don’t you have pick-up lines for me?

1069
01:06:00,456 --> 01:06:03,458
Ah, are you challenging me?

1070
01:06:04,192 --> 01:06:06,461
Alright Rabin, are you P-POP?

1071
01:06:06,462 --> 01:06:07,129
Why?

1072
01:06:07,130 --> 01:06:08,922
Because,

1073
01:06:09,402 --> 01:06:14,454
Our next performers are P-POP idols!

1074
01:06:15,680 --> 01:06:17,430
I thought it was something else.

1075
01:06:17,431 --> 01:06:20,433
But before we watch them, Section E Nation,

1076
01:06:20,434 --> 01:06:23,436
I would like to thank,

1077
01:06:23,437 --> 01:06:27,273
I would like to thank Botejyu,
Wingzone, and Yogorino.

1078
01:06:27,526 --> 01:06:32,238
Thank you also to OneCast, PICK
Cosmetics, The Lab by Blanc Doux.

1079
01:06:32,822 --> 01:06:36,492
Yes, Section E Nation!

1080
01:06:38,160 --> 01:06:40,912
Thanks it will get more
exciting from here on.

1081
01:06:40,913 --> 01:06:45,667
Because it’s time for some
P-pop lovin’ together with

1082
01:06:45,668 --> 01:06:52,633
Ethan, Charles, Michael,
Derick, and Hans! G-A-T!

1083
01:07:09,316 --> 01:07:11,776
Now, you can say we’re really close.

1084
01:07:11,777 --> 01:07:14,654
There’s nothing, we’re
hugging each other now.

1085
01:07:14,655 --> 01:07:17,657
Three, three, four hugging. Anyone.

1086
01:07:17,658 --> 01:07:20,660
It’s like you know, we
really miss each other.

1087
01:07:20,661 --> 01:07:23,663
But I think that’s the beauty
of this cast, this Section E cast.

1088
01:07:23,903 --> 01:07:28,700
Because we all have this
friendship, we all have this bonding.

1089
01:07:40,222 --> 01:07:41,890
Are you nervous?

1090
01:07:41,891 --> 01:07:43,308
Because I’m nervous.

1091
01:07:43,309 --> 01:07:48,939
I don’t know how to handle it, I’m nervous,
super excited so it’s like one emotion.

1092
01:07:49,565 --> 01:07:53,069
- I hope you enjoy.
- We were trying to remove the nervousness.

1093
01:07:53,094 --> 01:07:56,836
Because we can all feel
that we’re nervous and we just

1094
01:07:56,860 --> 01:08:00,601
really wanted to perform
as well as we possibly could.

1095
01:08:24,809 --> 01:08:27,570
Such a warm feeling to
know that everyone was

1096
01:08:27,594 --> 01:08:30,355
there for all of us.
They support the show.

1097
01:08:30,356 --> 01:08:32,482
They support all the musical artists too.

1098
01:08:32,507 --> 01:08:34,674
Then, of course, they all love the OST.

1099
01:08:35,850 --> 01:08:37,558
And so, we’re just so thankful.

1100
01:08:37,901 --> 01:08:41,074
It’s really overwhelming, really exciting.

1101
01:08:41,075 --> 01:08:48,207
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and…

1102
01:08:56,973 --> 01:09:01,761
Are you ready to be my beloved?

1103
01:09:01,762 --> 01:09:05,598
Sorry, I think I’m feeling
like loving you right now.

1104
01:09:05,599 --> 01:09:09,519
Don’t worry, I’m not a cheater

1105
01:09:09,520 --> 01:09:12,523
I just want to be the
one who’s with you alone.

1106
01:09:13,732 --> 01:09:17,527
Just choose between the two.

1107
01:09:17,528 --> 01:09:22,157
Love me or I’ll make you love me.

1108
01:09:22,158 --> 01:09:26,161
Haven’t you noticed yet?

1109
01:09:26,162 --> 01:09:30,456
With me, you have no chance, so.

1110
01:09:30,457 --> 01:09:32,458
Don’t argue anymore, no, no.

1111
01:09:32,459 --> 01:09:34,627
From now on, it’s us.

1112
01:09:34,628 --> 01:09:37,255
Don’t insist anymore, no, no.

1113
01:09:37,256 --> 01:09:40,925
Are you still playing hard to get?

1114
01:09:40,926 --> 01:09:43,511
I won’t let you go.

1115
01:09:43,512 --> 01:09:43,929
Don’t argue anymore, don’t
argue anymore I won’t let you go.

1116
01:09:43,930 --> 01:09:45,680
Don’t argue anymore, don’t argue anymore.

1117
01:09:45,681 --> 01:09:48,683
From now on, just be mine.

1118
01:09:48,684 --> 01:09:54,690
Doo-roo, doo-roo, doo.

1119
01:09:56,066 --> 01:10:00,737
Let’s keep it just between us,
I won’t spread it around

1120
01:10:00,738 --> 01:10:05,200
Sorry, sorry, they already
know everything

1121
01:10:05,201 --> 01:10:08,828
Don’t worry, I’m the only one who’s sure.

1122
01:10:08,829 --> 01:10:11,831
So no one else will try to charm you.

1123
01:10:11,832 --> 01:10:17,128
Just choose between the two.

1124
01:10:17,129 --> 01:10:22,050
Love me or I’ll make you love me.

1125
01:10:22,051 --> 01:10:25,053
Haven’t you noticed yet?

1126
01:10:25,054 --> 01:10:29,641
With me, you have no chance, so.

1127
01:10:29,642 --> 01:10:32,268
Don’t argue anymore, no, no.

1128

Don’t insist anymore, no, no.

1130
01:10:36,523 --> 01:10:39,525
Are you still playing hard to get?

1131
01:10:39,526 --> 01:10:40,526
Because someone like you is rare

1132
01:10:40,527 --> 01:10:42,528
I won’t let you go.

1133
01:10:42,529 --> 01:10:44,948
Don’t argue anymore, don’t argue anymore.

1134
01:10:44,949 --> 01:10:47,951
From now on, just be mine.

1135
01:10:47,952 --> 01:10:50,954
Sounds fresh just to hear it.

1136
01:10:50,955 --> 01:10:55,625
That from now on, you’re only mine.

1137
01:10:55,626 --> 01:11:00,088
If you have complaints, just keep quiet

1138
01:11:00,089 --> 01:11:03,092
I will never give in

1139
01:11:19,108 --> 01:11:22,527
1, 2, 3, don’t argue anymore, no, no.

WOW! There are so many of you!

1159
01:12:18,125 --> 01:12:22,421
Wow, thank you so much for coming tonight.

1160
01:12:23,130 --> 01:12:25,423
Wow. You’re amazing.

1161
01:12:25,424 --> 01:12:26,425
Wait, wait, wait.

1162
01:12:27,801 --> 01:12:29,219
First of all,

1163
01:12:29,678 --> 01:12:31,346
I’m G-A-T Ethan!

1164
01:12:31,347 --> 01:12:32,430
I’m G-A-T Charles.

1165
01:12:32,431 --> 01:12:33,515
I’m G-A-T Derick.

1166
01:12:34,058 --> 01:12:35,058
I’m G-A-T Michael

1167
01:12:35,113 --> 01:12:36,031
I'm G-A-T Hans.

1168
01:12:36,056 --> 01:12:40,267
And we are... G-A-T!

1169
01:12:41,231 --> 01:12:43,399
Wooh! And for our next song,

1170
01:12:43,400 --> 01:12:46,862
I know you’ll like this,
This is for all of you.

1171
01:12:47,180 --> 01:12:48,180
I feel like.

1172
01:13:06,465 --> 01:13:08,508
Fallin' out, fallin' in.

1173
01:13:08,509 --> 01:13:11,511
Nothing's sure in this world no, no.

1174
01:13:11,512 --> 01:13:13,430
Breakin' out, breakin' in.

1175
01:13:13,806 --> 01:13:17,559
Never knowin' what lies ahead.

1176
01:13:18,310 --> 01:13:26,310
We can really never
tell it all, no, no, no.

1177
01:13:28,529 --> 01:13:30,238
Say goodbye, say hello.

1178
01:13:30,239 --> 01:13:32,031
To a lover or friend.

1179
01:13:32,032 --> 01:13:35,034
Sometimes we never could understand.

1180
01:13:35,035 --> 01:13:38,539
Why some things begin then just end.

1181
01:13:39,540 --> 01:13:47,540
We can really never have it all no, no, no.

1182
01:13:47,881 --> 01:13:52,427
But oh  Can't you see.

1183
01:13:52,428 --> 01:13:56,556
That no matter what happens.

1184
01:13:56,557 --> 01:13:58,266
Life goes on and on.

1185
01:13:58,267 --> 01:14:02,604
And so baby, just smile.

1186
01:14:04,565 --> 01:14:06,649
Cause I'm always around you.

1187
01:14:06,650 --> 01:14:09,653
And I'll make you see how beautiful.

1188
01:14:10,195 --> 01:14:11,275
Let’s all sing it together!

1189
01:14:12,030 --> 01:14:14,532
Take a little time, baby.

1190
01:14:14,533 --> 01:14:17,535
See the butterflies' colors.

1191
01:14:17,536 --> 01:14:19,787
Listen to the birds that were sent.

1192
01:14:19,788 --> 01:14:22,790
To sing for me and you.

1193
01:14:22,791 --> 01:14:26,879
Can you feel me?

1194
01:14:27,713 --> 01:14:33,384
This is such a wonderful place to be.

1195
01:14:33,385 --> 01:14:36,387
Even if there is pain now.

1196
01:14:36,388 --> 01:14:39,390
Everything would be all right.

1197
01:14:39,391 --> 01:14:41,559
For as long as the world still turns.

1198
01:14:41,560 --> 01:14:44,980
There will be night and day.

1199
01:14:45,772 --> 01:14:48,733
Can you hear me?

1200
01:14:48,734 --> 01:14:54,198
There's a rainbow always after the rain.

1201
01:14:56,742 --> 01:15:00,536
Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh...

1202
01:15:00,537 --> 01:15:02,747
Hittin' high, hittin' low.

1203
01:15:02,748 --> 01:15:05,958
Win or lose you should go, yeah yeah.

1204
01:15:05,959 --> 01:15:08,211
Getting warm, getting cold.

1205
01:15:08,212 --> 01:15:12,673
Weather could be so good or bad.

1206
01:15:12,674 --> 01:15:18,596
But baby, this is life now don't get mad

1207
01:15:18,597 --> 01:15:20,881
no, no, no.

1208
01:15:20,906 --> 01:15:25,660
'Cause oh , can't you see.

1209
01:15:26,128 --> 01:15:29,006
That no matter what happens.

1210
01:15:29,338 --> 01:15:31,548
Life goes on and on.

1211
01:15:32,008 --> 01:15:35,871
So baby, please smile.

1212
01:15:37,366 --> 01:15:39,867
'Cause I'm always around you.

1213
01:15:39,892 --> 01:15:42,560
And I'll make you see how beautiful.

1214
01:15:42,585 --> 01:15:45,044
Life is for you and me.

1215
01:15:45,069 --> 01:15:47,235
Take a little time, baby.

1216
01:15:47,640 --> 01:15:50,642
See the butterflies' colors.

1217
01:15:50,667 --> 01:15:53,127
Listen to the birds that were sent.

1218
01:15:53,152 --> 01:15:56,155
To sing for me and you.

1219
01:15:57,928 --> 01:16:00,264
Can you feel me?

1220
01:16:00,931 --> 01:16:06,727
This is such a wonderful place to be.

1221
01:16:06,728 --> 01:16:08,980
Even if there is pain now.

1222
01:16:08,981 --> 01:16:11,983
Everything would be all right.

1223
01:16:11,984 --> 01:16:14,443
For as long as the world still turns.

1224
01:16:14,444 --> 01:16:18,948
There will be night and day.

1225
01:16:18,949 --> 01:16:21,951
Can you hear me?

1226
01:16:21,952 --> 01:16:27,624
There's a rainbow always after the rain.

1227
01:16:28,125 --> 01:16:30,626
Life's full of challenges.

1228
01:16:30,627 --> 01:16:34,881
Not all the time we get what we want.

1229
01:16:35,179 --> 01:16:39,168
But don't despair my
dear

1230
01:16:39,193 --> 01:16:45,055
You'll take each trial and you'll make it
through the storm cause you're strong

1231
01:16:45,434 --> 01:16:49,229
my faith in you is clear.

1232
01:16:49,563 --> 01:16:53,025
So I'll say once again this
world's wonderful

1233
01:16:53,719 --> 01:16:58,530
Let us celebrate life that's so beautiful

1234
01:16:59,438 --> 01:17:01,689
so beautiful

1235
01:17:02,284 --> 01:17:04,994
Take a little time, baby.

1236
01:17:04,995 --> 01:17:07,830
See the butterflies' colors.

1237
01:17:07,831 --> 01:17:10,833
Listen to the birds that were sent to sing

1238
01:17:10,834 --> 01:17:13,836
for me and you.

1239
01:17:13,837 --> 01:17:16,840
Can you feel me?

1240
01:17:17,507 --> 01:17:23,763
This is such a wonderful place to be.

1241
01:17:23,764 --> 01:17:26,390
Even if there is pain now

1242
01:17:26,391 --> 01:17:28,851
Everything would be all right.

1243
01:17:28,852 --> 01:17:32,563
For as long as the world still turns there

1244
01:17:32,564 --> 01:17:36,317
will be night and day.

1245
01:17:36,318 --> 01:17:39,362
Can you feel me?

1246
01:17:39,363 --> 01:17:45,702
There's a rainbow always after the rain.

1247
01:17:47,245 --> 01:17:50,957
Amazing. Really amazing!

1248
01:17:51,333 --> 01:17:57,005
Again, hello New Frontier
Theater! Are you still okay?!

1249
01:17:57,464 --> 01:18:01,008
Wow Section E Nation! It’s us again, G-A-T.

1250
01:18:01,009 --> 01:18:04,011
Thank you so much for your support

1251
01:18:04,012 --> 01:18:05,763
here with the five of us,
and of course the whole cast

1252
01:18:05,764 --> 01:18:08,517
of Section E. Long live PPOP!

1253
01:18:09,601 --> 01:18:10,102
Let’s go!

1254
01:18:10,310 --> 01:18:13,729
Thank you so much to all of
you for giving us the chance

1255
01:18:13,730 --> 01:18:14,980
to perform here at NFT.

1256
01:18:14,981 --> 01:18:18,192
Actually, it’s also a dream
of ours as a group to perform.

1257
01:18:18,193 --> 01:18:20,195
So yeah, thank you so much to everyone.

1258
01:18:20,570 --> 01:18:23,531
And hey, isn’t it true that this June 20,

1259
01:18:23,532 --> 01:18:26,535
we will perform here again at NFT.

1260
01:18:27,869 --> 01:18:32,998
Together with Amiel Sol, Earl Agustin,

1261
01:18:32,999 --> 01:18:35,209
Rob Deniel, Mutya OST Live in Concert

1262
01:18:35,210 --> 01:18:37,795
featuring the cast of Mutya, Section E.

1263
01:18:37,796 --> 01:18:41,466
Let’s meet again on June
20. We’ll be here again!

1264
01:18:41,967 --> 01:18:45,223
And of course, none of this
would be possible without you guys.

1265
01:18:45,248 --> 01:18:47,555
So thank you so much to all of you

1266
01:18:47,556 --> 01:18:50,599
for your support. Just keep working hard.

1267
01:18:50,600 --> 01:18:52,059
We will keep practicing.

1268
01:18:52,060 --> 01:18:54,569
And of course, we will create more music.

1269
01:18:54,594 --> 01:18:57,198
Everything will definitely be worth it.

1270
01:18:57,223 --> 01:18:58,780
Of course, step by step, right?

1271
01:18:58,805 --> 01:19:00,711
All of us to success! Right?

1272
01:19:00,736 --> 01:19:02,981
Step by step. Step by step.

1273
01:19:03,006 --> 01:19:04,905
But, but of course, we’re beyond grateful

1274
01:19:04,906 --> 01:19:07,450
to everyone who did our
dance challenge, right?

1275
01:19:07,451 --> 01:19:09,076
Without you guys, we
wouldn’t have been able

1276
01:19:09,077 --> 01:19:10,619
to achieve this kind of success.

1277
01:19:10,620 --> 01:19:12,163
And we’re just really
grateful to you, guys.

1278
01:19:12,164 --> 01:19:13,623
Thank you. Thank you so much.

1279
01:19:14,332 --> 01:19:17,669
And also guys, thank you so much

1280
01:19:17,794 --> 01:19:19,962
to everyone who keeps supporting and

1281
01:19:19,987 --> 01:19:22,757
loves P-POP and OPM.

1282
01:19:22,758 --> 01:19:25,468
G-A-T just performed "Wag Ka Na Humirit,"

1283
01:19:25,469 --> 01:19:27,261
and of course, Rainbow, our cover.

1284
01:19:27,262 --> 01:19:30,681
And we’re just so happy
that this is finally happening

1285
01:19:30,682 --> 01:19:33,684
because we prepared
for this for a long time.

1286
01:19:33,685 --> 01:19:37,980
We prepared for like
one week, two weeks-ish.

1287
01:19:37,981 --> 01:19:42,151
Of course, there were some
production things we just learned.

1288
01:19:42,152 --> 01:19:44,653
This is finally it. We’re almost done,

1289
01:19:44,678 --> 01:19:45,998
but our memories will be forever.

1290
01:19:46,705 --> 01:19:48,247
And speaking of OPM,

1291
01:19:48,272 --> 01:19:49,398
Oh, what’s that dude?

1292
01:19:50,202 --> 01:19:51,504
Are you guys ready?

1293
01:19:51,661 --> 01:19:53,579
- What’s that, though?
- Doesn’t seem like it.

1294
01:19:53,580 --> 01:19:54,872
Wait, are you guys ready?

1295
01:19:56,166 --> 01:19:57,708
Seems like—they’re not ready yet.

1296
01:19:57,709 --> 01:19:59,044
Seems like not yet but...

1297
01:20:00,253 --> 01:20:02,881
Are you ready to be even more thrilled?

1298
01:20:03,965 --> 01:20:06,050
I don’t think so.

1299
01:20:06,051 --> 01:20:07,761
- Seriously, I think they are not ready yet.
- Alright. One more. One more.

1300
01:20:07,762 --> 01:20:10,429
- Let’s see. Let’s see.
- Okay, crowd check, crowd check.

1301
01:20:10,430 --> 01:20:13,432
- Let’s do a vibe check per section.
- Okay.

1302
01:20:13,433 --> 01:20:14,518
Are you still okay?!

1303
01:20:15,894 --> 01:20:17,414
- How about this side?
- In the middle?

1304
01:20:18,146 --> 01:20:19,939
Over here! On the other side!

1305
01:20:19,940 --> 01:20:21,440
- Wait - It's louder over there.

1306
01:20:21,441 --> 01:20:22,359
The ones up there?!

1307
01:20:22,777 --> 01:20:24,611
There! Exactly! Wow, they’re louder there.

1308
01:20:24,778 --> 01:20:26,500
Team AshDres!

1309
01:20:27,405 --> 01:20:29,825
Wow! Team AshBin?!

1310
01:20:31,350 --> 01:20:32,143
There!

1311
01:20:32,245 --> 01:20:33,536
Well, before anything else.

1312
01:20:33,537 --> 01:20:35,162
He’s going to set your hearts beating.

1313
01:20:35,163 --> 01:20:36,205
That’s right!

1314
01:20:36,206 --> 01:20:38,040
Because he’s all ready to serenade you

1315
01:20:38,041 --> 01:20:40,417
and make your hearts beating.

1316
01:20:40,418 --> 01:20:45,465
Let’s give it up for Earl Agustin!

1317
01:21:37,642 --> 01:21:39,436
New Frontier!

1318
01:21:50,614 --> 01:21:53,533
Wait.

1319
01:21:54,951 --> 01:21:59,788
The battle is getting more difficult.

1320
01:22:00,750 --> 01:22:06,003
I’m slowly falling in love.

1321
01:22:07,923 --> 01:22:13,302
I can’t fight this feeling anymore.

1322
01:22:13,303 --> 01:22:18,557
And no matter how I try.

1323
01:22:19,851 --> 01:22:27,024
To stop this feeling

1324
01:22:27,025 --> 01:22:35,025
I want to ask you to an everlasting love

1325
01:22:39,690 --> 01:22:42,692
In every day

1326
01:22:42,832 --> 01:22:48,629
I will choose you, love you, my beloved.

1327
01:22:48,630 --> 01:22:55,178
If you will allow me to ask you.

1328
01:22:57,180 --> 01:23:00,808
Hmm, ohh.

1329
01:23:01,560 --> 01:23:03,477
My friend.

1330
01:23:05,496 --> 01:23:10,919
Is it possible for us to fall in love.

1331
01:23:10,944 --> 01:23:14,029
Wait.

1332
01:23:14,030 --> 01:23:17,033
Please, wait.

1333
01:23:18,284 --> 01:23:23,540
Can we talk about this?

1334
01:23:23,707 --> 01:23:30,254
If we confess to one another

1335
01:23:30,255 --> 01:23:35,927
and the feeling is mutual.

1336
01:23:37,470 --> 01:23:37,512
I want to ask you for a lifelong

1337
01:23:37,513 --> 01:23:45,513
I want to ask you to an everlasting love.

1338
01:23:50,316 --> 01:23:52,860
In every day

1339
01:23:52,861 --> 01:23:58,741
I will choose you, love you, my beloved.

1340
01:23:58,742 --> 01:24:05,874
If you will allow me to ask you.

1341
01:24:34,861 --> 01:24:42,861
I want to ask you to an everlasting love.

1342
01:24:47,332 --> 01:24:50,334
In every day

1343
01:24:50,335 --> 01:24:56,465
I will choose you, love you, my beloved.

1344
01:24:56,466 --> 01:24:59,551
If you will allow me to ask you.

1345
01:24:59,552 --> 01:25:01,053
If you let me

1346
01:25:01,054 --> 01:25:06,767
I want to ask you to an everlasting love.

1347
01:25:06,768 --> 01:25:13,524
An everlasting love.

1348
01:25:13,525 --> 01:25:16,527
In every day

1349
01:25:16,528 --> 01:25:22,324
I will choose you, love you, my beloved.

1350
01:25:22,325 --> 01:25:28,789
If you will allow me to ask you.

1351
01:25:28,790 --> 01:25:29,915
If you let me ask you.

1352
01:25:30,376 --> 01:25:32,919
NFT make some noise!

1353
01:25:57,193 --> 01:25:59,821
- I love you, Ear!
- I love you too!

1354
01:26:00,738 --> 01:26:01,864
Hello, good afternoon!

1355
01:26:01,865 --> 01:26:02,948
Good evening to everyone!

1356
01:26:02,949 --> 01:26:04,450
I am Earl Agustin.

1357
01:26:05,368 --> 01:26:07,953
And that song is called Aya.

1358
01:26:08,288 --> 01:26:08,997
There.

1359
01:26:09,497 --> 01:26:10,081
So...

1360
01:26:10,362 --> 01:26:14,740
this next song, maybe you’ve
already heard it on Tiktok.

1361
01:26:15,587 --> 01:26:18,423
Maybe you’ve also heard it on the series.

1362
01:26:18,840 --> 01:26:22,135
And, uh... But before that, I
just want to invite all of you

1363
01:26:22,552 --> 01:26:25,971
to our concert this June 20, 2025.

1364
01:26:25,972 --> 01:26:29,851
Mutya OST Live in
Concert, right here at NFT.

1365
01:26:30,268 --> 01:26:34,855
I’ll be with G-A-T, Amiel
Sol, and Rob Deniel.

1366
01:26:34,856 --> 01:26:37,733
Featuring the cast of
Ang Mutya ng Section E.

1367
01:26:37,734 --> 01:26:39,360
Thank you so much!

1368
01:26:39,652 --> 01:26:41,904
This next song is called Tibok.

1369
01:26:41,905 --> 01:26:43,531
I hope you guys will like this one.

1370
01:27:06,471 --> 01:27:09,849
I hope, I really hope.

1371
01:27:12,894 --> 01:27:16,272
That I’ll be given a chance.

1372
01:27:19,651 --> 01:27:23,029
So you can hear.

1373
01:27:26,199 --> 01:27:29,576
I hope, I really hope

1374
01:27:29,577 --> 01:27:32,956
that I’ll be given a chance.

1375
01:27:33,498 --> 01:27:36,166
So you can hear

1376
01:27:36,167 --> 01:27:40,338
a heart that beats only for you.

1377
01:27:58,231 --> 01:27:59,941
Let’s sing along.

1378
01:28:02,777 --> 01:28:08,574
It started with simple glances,
trying to get your attention.

1379
01:28:09,575 --> 01:28:15,164
Turned into exchanged
messages, and suddenly I’m excited.

1380
01:28:15,623 --> 01:28:20,712
“How are you? Let’s
eat. Hello, good morning”

1381
01:28:22,422 --> 01:28:27,510
“Take care,” “Get some
rest,” “Don’t stay up too late”.

1382
01:28:29,595 --> 01:28:35,600
My heart slowly felt, I’m falling for you.

1383
01:28:35,601 --> 01:28:39,604
Each day that we talk,

1384
01:28:39,605 --> 01:28:42,149
I’ve started to feel something.

1385
01:28:42,150 --> 01:28:45,152
But I don’t know.

1386
01:28:45,153 --> 01:28:49,156
Where this is heading.

1387
01:28:49,157 --> 01:28:52,159
All I’m hoping for.

1388
01:28:52,160 --> 01:28:55,162
That this feeling

1389
01:28:59,167 --> 01:29:00,208
Sing!

1390
01:29:00,209 --> 01:29:03,086
I hope, I really hope

1391
01:29:03,087 --> 01:29:06,715
that I’ll be given a chance

1392
01:29:06,716 --> 01:29:09,343
so you can hear.

1393
01:29:09,344 --> 01:29:13,430
My heart that beats only for you.

1394
01:29:13,431 --> 01:29:16,767
I can feel

1395
01:29:16,768 --> 01:29:19,770
real happiness

1396
01:29:19,771 --> 01:29:27,771
I hope, I hope the
heartbeat will be granted, oh.

1397
01:29:33,117 --> 01:29:40,207
Hmm, but suddenly, there’s
silence, nothing to recall.

1398
01:29:40,208 --> 01:29:47,298
If I said anything, that
might have hurt you.

1399
01:29:47,924 --> 01:29:52,511
Suddenly you didn’t reach out.

1400
01:29:52,512 --> 01:30:00,395
Have you grown tired of
me or are you just busy?

1401
01:30:01,104 --> 01:30:04,481
Tell me the truth

1402
01:30:04,482 --> 01:30:07,692
so I won’t be confused

1403
01:30:07,693 --> 01:30:11,072
Where do I stand?

1404
01:30:12,782 --> 01:30:15,325
Because I no longer know.

1405
01:30:15,326 --> 01:30:19,080
Where this is heading.

1406
01:30:19,288 --> 01:30:22,374
All I’m hoping for

1407
01:30:22,375 --> 01:30:25,378
is for this feeling...

1408
01:30:29,799 --> 01:30:33,260
I hope, I really hope

1409
01:30:33,261 --> 01:30:36,513
that I’ll be given a chance

1410
01:30:36,514 --> 01:30:39,182
so you can hear.

1411
01:30:39,183 --> 01:30:43,186
My heart that beats only for you.

1412
01:30:43,187 --> 01:30:46,940
I can feel

1413
01:30:46,941 --> 01:30:49,901
real happiness

1414
01:30:49,902 --> 01:30:52,487
I hope, I really hope

1415
01:30:52,488 --> 01:30:58,827
you’ll hear a heart
that beats only for you.

1416
01:30:58,828 --> 01:31:02,915
Ohh.

1417
01:31:03,541 --> 01:31:07,961
I hope this won’t last too long.

1418
01:31:07,962 --> 01:31:10,464
Just admit

1419
01:31:10,465 --> 01:31:16,762
what you really feel.

1420
01:31:17,263 --> 01:31:21,224
Please tell me

1421
01:31:21,225 --> 01:31:24,144
if you feel the same

1422
01:31:24,145 --> 01:31:29,358
I hope you do too.

1423
01:31:43,539 --> 01:31:46,625
Ohh ohh ohh

1424
01:31:46,626 --> 01:31:50,086
I hope, I really hope

1425
01:31:50,087 --> 01:31:53,340
that I’ll be given a chance

1426
01:31:53,341 --> 01:31:56,009
so you can hear

1427
01:31:56,010 --> 01:32:00,013
my heart that beats only for you.

1428
01:32:00,014 --> 01:32:03,683
I can feel

1429
01:32:03,684 --> 01:32:06,728
real happiness

1430
01:32:06,729 --> 01:32:09,314
I hope, I really hope

1431
01:32:09,315 --> 01:32:13,777
you’ll hear a heart that beats only for you

1432
01:32:13,778 --> 01:32:16,905
I hope, I really hope

1433
01:32:16,906 --> 01:32:20,158
that I’ll be given a chance

1434
01:32:20,159 --> 01:32:22,537
so you can hear...

1435
01:32:27,333 --> 01:32:30,210
I can feel the

1436
01:32:30,211 --> 01:32:33,171
real happiness

1437
01:32:33,172 --> 01:32:35,799
I hope, I really hope

1438
01:32:35,800 --> 01:32:40,262
you’ll hear a heart that beats only for you

1439
01:32:40,263 --> 01:32:43,390
I hope, I really hope

1440
01:32:43,391 --> 01:32:46,643
that I’ll be given a chance

1441
01:32:46,644 --> 01:32:49,021
so you can hear...

1442
01:32:53,568 --> 01:32:56,444
I can feel the

1443
01:32:56,445 --> 01:32:59,406
real happiness

1444
01:32:59,407 --> 01:33:02,034
I hope, I really hope

1445
01:33:02,868 --> 01:33:08,916
you’ll hear a heart
that beats only for you.

1446
01:33:37,612 --> 01:33:45,612
You hear a heart that beats only for you.

1447
01:33:52,585 --> 01:33:56,046
Thank you everyone!
To God be all the Glory!

1448
01:33:56,047 --> 01:33:57,506
Thank you!

1449
01:34:00,635 --> 01:34:03,387
First of all, I’m super
happy and super blessed

1450
01:34:03,679 --> 01:34:05,972
to be part of the line-up today.

1451
01:34:05,973 --> 01:34:08,558
And yeah, I’m super excited to perform

1452
01:34:08,559 --> 01:34:11,353
here today.

1453
01:34:11,354 --> 01:34:14,564
Actually, I’m just really
happy, and like I said,

1454
01:34:14,565 --> 01:34:16,317
super excited to perform right now...

1455
01:34:16,692 --> 01:34:19,694
And uh, super excited to see the people.

1456
01:34:19,695 --> 01:34:21,404
And to have them sing along.

1457
01:34:21,405 --> 01:34:25,867
To the cast of Mutya,
thank you so, so much,

1458
01:34:25,868 --> 01:34:30,246
and good luck with Season
2 of Ang Mutya ng Section E!

1459
01:34:30,247 --> 01:34:31,915
And of course, God bless you guys.

1460
01:34:31,916 --> 01:34:34,919
And more success to the series.

1461
01:34:35,670 --> 01:34:40,633
Wow! Earl Agustin in the house!

1462
01:34:41,550 --> 01:34:42,426
Amazing!

1463
01:34:42,427 --> 01:34:44,010
I can almost hear the heart beats

1464
01:34:44,011 --> 01:34:46,054
of everyone here at NFT!

1465
01:34:46,055 --> 01:34:47,890
Did you guys love that?

1466
01:34:48,849 --> 01:34:50,976
Did everyone get giddy?

1467
01:34:51,727 --> 01:34:52,978
Do you guys want more?

1468
01:34:54,021 --> 01:34:56,524
Because, honestly, that level of giddyness-

1469
01:34:57,149 --> 01:34:58,359
Oh, there’s two chairs?

1470
01:35:00,695 --> 01:35:02,696
Nothing, I just felt like
putting two chairs here

1471
01:35:02,697 --> 01:35:06,367
because, you know, casual
vibes—it’s a concert, after all!

1472
01:35:07,034 --> 01:35:09,160
Good thing you handled the
excitement from Earl Agustin.

1473
01:35:09,161 --> 01:35:11,872
Because this part, you
might not be able to handle it.

1474
01:35:15,543 --> 01:35:18,253
Personally? I don’t
think I can handle it either

1475
01:35:18,254 --> 01:35:19,254
because-

1476
01:35:19,880 --> 01:35:20,880
This is it!

1477
01:35:21,298 --> 01:35:24,592
Let’s take this heart-thumping
moment even further...

1478
01:35:24,593 --> 01:35:27,137
Actually, not just thumping.

1479
01:35:27,138 --> 01:35:30,141
Your hearts are going
to be pounding because...

1480
01:35:30,599 --> 01:35:33,017
Here it is, oh my gosh, I’m so excited.

1481
01:35:33,018 --> 01:35:34,436
It’s time for the Q&A segment

1482
01:35:34,437 --> 01:35:36,020
with Jay-jay and Kiefer.

1483
01:35:36,021 --> 01:35:39,024
From Ang Mutya ng Section E!

1484
01:35:40,735 --> 01:35:44,989
Ashtine and Andres!

1485
01:35:46,949 --> 01:35:50,494
Wow! Yoohoo!

1486
01:35:58,586 --> 01:36:00,629
Oh my gosh!

1487
01:36:01,964 --> 01:36:02,965
Wooh!

1488
01:36:03,674 --> 01:36:04,675
Amaz-oh!

1489
01:36:06,886 --> 01:36:08,553
You’re wearing a dress,
you’re wearing a dress.

1490
01:36:08,554 --> 01:36:09,180
Just a skirt,

1491
01:36:09,181 --> 01:36:11,055
Earlier during rehearsal, you know guys,

1492
01:36:11,056 --> 01:36:13,434
during the rehearsal
earlier, we were doing this.

1493
01:36:13,976 --> 01:36:16,227
No, you can’t do that now.

1494
01:36:16,228 --> 01:36:17,228
Yeah, what a shame.

1495
01:36:17,480 --> 01:36:18,480
Guys!

1496
01:36:18,773 --> 01:36:19,523
Let me just introduce them.

1497
01:36:19,524 --> 01:36:20,649
It’s Ashtine and Andres!

1498
01:36:21,192 --> 01:36:22,193
It’s them!

1499
01:36:22,943 --> 01:36:24,612
- But...
- Hello, everyone!

1500
01:36:25,112 --> 01:36:27,031
I know this isn’t in the script, but,

1501
01:36:27,490 --> 01:36:29,690
Can I request something? Do
you know the Me Jalo trend?

1502
01:36:30,034 --> 01:36:31,034
You know the-

1503
01:36:33,245 --> 01:36:35,622
Please, just one time.
Please grant me this.

1504
01:36:35,623 --> 01:36:37,749
- Please, please, please, please.
- Okay okay, let’s do it! Let’s do it!

1505
01:36:37,750 --> 01:36:39,502
Guys, ready to edit okay?

1506
01:36:39,794 --> 01:36:41,085
Just one, just one, promise, please!

1507
01:36:41,086 --> 01:36:42,378
Wait! Who goes first?

1508
01:36:42,379 --> 01:36:46,049
A-Ash goes first, then you pull her.

1509
01:36:46,050 --> 01:36:47,801
- Alright!
- Time it. Time it. Ready?

1510
01:36:47,802 --> 01:36:49,427
Who? Oh wait! You have to sing!

1511
01:36:49,428 --> 01:36:52,431
Okay okay, I’ll sing. Where’s the band?

1512
01:36:52,723 --> 01:36:55,935
Wah! Okay, ready, 5, 6, 7...

1513
01:37:02,066 --> 01:37:05,569
Side, side, side, and hug.

1514
01:37:08,030 --> 01:37:09,114
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.

1515
01:37:09,782 --> 01:37:13,160
I almost really did it!

1516
01:37:13,702 --> 01:37:14,869
Almost! Okay.

1517
01:37:14,870 --> 01:37:19,624
But can I just say, guys?
You look so beautiful tonight!

1518
01:37:19,625 --> 01:37:21,459
I mean, you’re always beautiful, Ashtine,

1519
01:37:21,460 --> 01:37:23,127
But tonight is extra, extra.

1520
01:37:23,128 --> 01:37:25,505
Right? Beautiful, right? Right! Right!

1521
01:37:25,506 --> 01:37:27,341
Thank you!

1522
01:37:28,175 --> 01:37:29,635
Thank you!

1523
01:37:30,094 --> 01:37:32,387
As for my boss, I totally agree with that!

1524
01:37:32,388 --> 01:37:33,222
Who, who, who?

1525
01:37:33,223 --> 01:37:35,432
- My boss.
- Ah, so she’s your boss!

1526
01:37:36,433 --> 01:37:37,433
But...

1527
01:37:45,150 --> 01:37:47,068
Since we mentioned that she’s your boss,

1528
01:37:47,069 --> 01:37:48,612
I just want to greet you both.

1529
01:37:48,904 --> 01:37:50,197
Happy Labor Day!

1530
01:37:50,531 --> 01:37:52,365
Because when no one else is working,
it’s only the two of you who seem to be.

1531
01:37:52,366 --> 01:37:55,911
Anyway, here it is, are
you ready for the questions?

1532
01:37:56,745 --> 01:38:01,374
Because I have here with
me a bowl full of questions.

1533
01:38:01,375 --> 01:38:05,420
What you’ll do is, you’ll draw one question

1534
01:38:05,421 --> 01:38:09,465
and you will answer the
questions within five minutes.

1535
01:38:09,466 --> 01:38:12,844
Alright? So, you have
to do this well and fast

1536
01:38:12,845 --> 01:38:15,179
because we only have five minutes. So...

1537
01:38:15,180 --> 01:38:16,307
Wait, what’s the prize?

1538
01:38:16,640 --> 01:38:17,640
Prize?

1539
01:38:21,020 --> 01:38:23,730
Do you want a prize? The
prize is right beside you!

1540
01:38:23,731 --> 01:38:25,648
How can I do my best if there’s no prize?

1541
01:38:25,649 --> 01:38:31,030
Well, I know— I know even
without a prize, right? Ashtine?

1542
01:38:31,697 --> 01:38:32,489
Look me in the eye.

1543
01:38:32,490 --> 01:38:35,326
Even without a prize,
you’ve already won in life.

1544
01:38:38,954 --> 01:38:42,041
I told you, I’ve got your back!

1545
01:38:42,625 --> 01:38:45,835
Alright, here we go! Let’s keep going.

1546
01:38:45,836 --> 01:38:46,961
Okay, okay.

1547
01:38:46,962 --> 01:38:50,089
So, Ashtine first. Then Andres.

1548
01:38:50,090 --> 01:38:52,884
Then a question for the both of you.

1549
01:38:52,885 --> 01:38:55,803
Okay? Again, under five minutes

1550
01:38:55,804 --> 01:38:57,431
we have to answer this, okay?

1551
01:38:57,806 --> 01:38:59,892
So, let’s begin.

1552
01:39:00,351 --> 01:39:01,351
Are you guys ready?

1553
01:39:01,560 --> 01:39:02,560
Wait. Come here.

1554
01:39:02,895 --> 01:39:04,312
- This is nerve-wracking, right?
- Competitve.

1555
01:39:04,313 --> 01:39:05,438
I’ll be here in the middle.

1556
01:39:05,439 --> 01:39:08,168
So... they will be the
ones to pick, Director, right?

1557
01:39:08,206 --> 01:39:08,694
Alright!

1558
01:39:08,777 --> 01:39:10,234
So, there’s a name on the paper.

1559
01:39:10,235 --> 01:39:12,779
If it’s your name, that’s the one you pick.

1560
01:39:12,780 --> 01:39:13,447
Okay?

1561
01:39:13,448 --> 01:39:15,281
These are carefully picked questions.

1562
01:39:15,282 --> 01:39:16,741
That’s-that’s why.

1563
01:39:16,742 --> 01:39:18,785
- Are you ready, Andres?
- I’m ready. I’m ready.

1564
01:39:18,786 --> 01:39:19,786
Are you ready?

1565
01:39:19,969 --> 01:39:20,969
- Okay.
- Here we go,

1566
01:39:21,914 --> 01:39:22,331
Okay.

1567
01:39:22,539 --> 01:39:24,290
5 minutes starts...

1568
01:39:24,291 --> 01:39:26,209
- This has to be quick, okay?
- Okay. Okay. Okay.

1569
01:39:26,210 --> 01:39:27,210
It has to be quick!

1570
01:39:28,379 --> 01:39:29,754
- 5 minutes.
- It has to be quick, right?

1571
01:39:29,755 --> 01:39:31,172
- Quick, brother!
- Okay, okay, go!

1572
01:39:31,173 --> 01:39:33,759
5 minutes starts now. Ashtine...

1573
01:39:34,134 --> 01:39:36,219
Read the question... okay,

1574
01:39:36,220 --> 01:39:38,429
One makeup item you always carry?

1575
01:39:38,430 --> 01:39:41,349
Or use? Just one, okay?

1576
01:39:41,350 --> 01:39:43,017
Liptint. Liptint, okay.

1577
01:39:43,018 --> 01:39:44,060
Andres, next.

1578
01:39:44,061 --> 01:39:46,437
We have names there, Andres. There we go.

1579
01:39:46,438 --> 01:39:47,480
Nice one brother.

1580
01:39:47,481 --> 01:39:50,484
It says here, what’s your
favorite love language?

1581
01:39:51,860 --> 01:39:53,612
Let’s go. 5 minutes, brother, 5 minutes.

1582
01:39:53,821 --> 01:39:56,489
My favorite love language
is Acts of Service because

1583
01:39:56,490 --> 01:39:57,699
that means thoughtfulness.

1584
01:39:57,700 --> 01:39:58,283
That’s it.

1585
01:39:58,284 --> 01:40:00,327
Perfect. Alright, wait...

1586
01:40:00,744 --> 01:40:01,829
For both of you.

1587
01:40:02,162 --> 01:40:03,038
Okay. Okay.

1588
01:40:03,039 --> 01:40:04,288
Ashtine?

1589
01:40:04,289 --> 01:40:05,790
Ladies, please.

1590
01:40:05,791 --> 01:40:07,500
There. Seems like it’s for the two of them.

1591
01:40:07,501 --> 01:40:08,377
One... Okay!

1592
01:40:08,378 --> 01:40:11,379
One word to best describe
each other. Ashtine to Andres.

1593
01:40:11,380 --> 01:40:12,256
One word.

1594
01:40:12,257 --> 01:40:13,257
Genuine.

1595
01:40:15,634 --> 01:40:17,051
Andres.

1596
01:40:17,052 --> 01:40:17,886
One word.

1597
01:40:17,887 --> 01:40:19,554
One word. One word, brother.

1598
01:40:19,555 --> 01:40:22,015
There are many. I can’t say it, guys.

1599
01:40:22,016 --> 01:40:22,558
First-

1600
01:40:22,559 --> 01:40:24,809
First thing on top of your—
First thing on top of your head?

1601
01:40:24,810 --> 01:40:26,352
- Nothing? Nothing?
- Genuine!

1602
01:40:26,353 --> 01:40:27,187
Just one.

1603
01:40:27,187 --> 01:40:27,855
I just copied you.

1604
01:40:27,856 --> 01:40:29,856
Genuine. Okay, okay. Choose.

1605
01:40:29,857 --> 01:40:32,859
For Ashtine, yes? How many minutes left?

1606
01:40:32,860 --> 01:40:35,403
Why is there even a timer, right? Like...

1607
01:40:35,404 --> 01:40:38,044
When was the last time you got butterflies
and what was the reason?

1608
01:40:39,491 --> 01:40:42,202
When was the last time you felt butterflies
and who was the reason?

1609
01:40:42,911 --> 01:40:46,206
Now, because you all
making me feel butterflies.

1610
01:40:47,416 --> 01:40:49,209
Okay. Really now?

1611
01:40:49,710 --> 01:40:52,837
Andres, look for your name, brother.

1612
01:40:52,838 --> 01:40:53,963
- Here, here, here.
- Okay.

1613
01:40:53,964 --> 01:40:56,924
It says here: “Who is your
personal hero and why?”

1614
01:40:56,925 --> 01:40:59,928
My personal hero is my dad because...

1615
01:41:02,097 --> 01:41:05,183
he's my idol and I’ve always
looked up to him since I was a kid.

1616
01:41:05,184 --> 01:41:05,684
So it’s him.

1617
01:41:05,685 --> 01:41:07,185
Thank you so much. I love that.

1618
01:41:07,186 --> 01:41:08,604
For both of you, guys

1619
01:41:09,104 --> 01:41:10,522
go ahead Ashtine—you’re the boss.

1620
01:41:11,565 --> 01:41:13,399
Best physical feature of each other.

1621
01:41:13,400 --> 01:41:14,484
Ashtine to Andres, let’s go.

1622
01:41:14,485 --> 01:41:15,920
- He should answer first.
- Alright.

1623
01:41:15,944 --> 01:41:17,821
What is Ashtine’s best physical feature?

1624
01:41:17,988 --> 01:41:20,615
- Why are you staring at her like that?
- Uhmm.

1625
01:41:20,616 --> 01:41:22,200
It’s like you’re not used to it.

1626
01:41:22,201 --> 01:41:24,577
Ash’s best feature? Her smile.

1627
01:41:24,578 --> 01:41:27,581
Because when I see her smile during taping-

1628
01:41:28,415 --> 01:41:30,541
- I agree.
- For me, it’s his eyes.

1629
01:41:30,542 --> 01:41:31,834
- I like it when he stares.
- What? What’s that again?

1630
01:41:31,835 --> 01:41:32,753
His eyes.

1631
01:41:32,753 --> 01:41:33,337
The eyes.

1632
01:41:33,338 --> 01:41:35,797
Okay, okay, okay. How
many minutes left—oh my God.

1633
01:41:35,798 --> 01:41:37,341
We got this. Let’s finish it.

1634
01:41:37,758 --> 01:41:38,425
Ashtine.

1635
01:41:38,426 --> 01:41:39,666
Take your time, take your time.

1636
01:41:39,718 --> 01:41:41,136
- Take your time.
- Take your time.

1637
01:41:41,929 --> 01:41:44,430
- Oh, I get it!
- Take your time. Take your time.

1638
01:41:44,431 --> 01:41:47,433
Hey, hurry up! This isn’t fair.

1639
01:41:47,434 --> 01:41:50,103
- I can’t open it.
- Ashtine, I’ll do it, I got it.

1640
01:41:50,104 --> 01:41:52,480
“What’s your favorite food
to eat when you’re sad?”

1641
01:41:52,481 --> 01:41:53,773
Ah, ice cream.

1642
01:41:53,774 --> 01:41:54,525
Ice cream.

1643
01:41:54,526 --> 01:41:57,527
Okay, okay. Andres, don’t be so slow!

1644
01:41:57,528 --> 01:41:58,821
I’ll do it now.

1645
01:42:00,531 --> 01:42:03,534
“What’s the sweetest thing
you’ve done for someone?”

1646
01:42:06,912 --> 01:42:08,538
I’m just reading it.

1647
01:42:08,539 --> 01:42:10,748
I can’t, I can’t, I can’t
really think—uhm...

1648
01:42:10,749 --> 01:42:12,909
- The sweetest thing I’ve done for someone?
- Yes. Yes.

1649
01:42:16,046 --> 01:42:18,506
There are many, guys. I can’t say.

1650
01:42:18,507 --> 01:42:20,341
You gave someone a ride
to where? To their house?

1651
01:42:20,342 --> 01:42:23,094
Or what? Or what?

1652
01:42:23,095 --> 01:42:24,637
You call her every night?

1653
01:42:24,638 --> 01:42:27,640
- Too many.
- Alright, we’ll get back to you on that.

1654
01:42:27,641 --> 01:42:29,401
- Ashtine, this one’s for you.
- He’s unfair.

1655
01:42:29,726 --> 01:42:30,644
For both of you,

1656
01:42:30,645 --> 01:42:31,811
Ashtine and Andres.

1657
01:42:31,812 --> 01:42:34,188
It says—hurry up! There’s
only 59 seconds left.

1658
01:42:34,189 --> 01:42:39,152
If your genie gave each of you
one wish, what would your wish be?

1659
01:42:39,153 --> 01:42:40,987
Ashtine first. One wish.

1660
01:42:40,988 --> 01:42:42,488
Happiness.

1661
01:42:42,489 --> 01:42:43,489
- Happy life.
- That’s right.

1662
01:42:43,490 --> 01:42:44,449
I love that.

1663
01:42:44,450 --> 01:42:45,658
My wish for Ashtine?

1664
01:42:45,659 --> 01:42:47,161
- No!
- Oh!

1665
01:42:49,580 --> 01:42:52,582
Wait a sec. Wish for... What do I wish for?

1666
01:42:52,583 --> 01:42:54,667
- For life, to your genie.
- For yourself!

1667
01:42:54,668 --> 01:42:55,586
Ahh for life. My life.

1668
01:42:55,587 --> 01:42:57,712
Oh, yes. Happiness too.

1669
01:42:57,713 --> 01:42:58,838
Happiness.

1670
01:42:58,839 --> 01:42:59,964
You got away with that, huh. Very good.

1671
01:42:59,965 --> 01:43:00,799
You got away with that, huh. So smart.

1672
01:43:00,800 --> 01:43:01,841
Okay, Ashtine!

1673
01:43:01,842 --> 01:43:03,176
- Okay, Andres, Andres, Andres.
- Here, here, okay.

1674
01:43:03,177 --> 01:43:04,136
Here, here, okay.

1675
01:43:04,136 --> 01:43:04,595
So slow.

1676
01:43:04,595 --> 01:43:05,512
Slower, even!

1677
01:43:05,513 --> 01:43:07,680
- Hey, you’re cheating.
- Here. Here.

1678
01:43:07,681 --> 01:43:08,265
Hurry up!

1679
01:43:08,390 --> 01:43:09,141
Give it to me, brother.

1680
01:43:09,142 --> 01:43:12,476
“If you had a superpower,
what would it be?”

1681
01:43:12,477 --> 01:43:13,145
Uhmm.

1682
01:43:13,146 --> 01:43:14,687
Super speed. Yeah!

1683
01:43:14,688 --> 01:43:15,730
Super speed?

1684
01:43:15,731 --> 01:43:18,734
Hurry up, Ash. Hurry, the
enemies are already here.

1685
01:43:19,026 --> 01:43:20,026
Okay. Okay.

1686
01:43:20,360 --> 01:43:21,760
“Who’s your ultimate idol and why?”

1687
01:43:22,404 --> 01:43:25,740
For me, it’s Sarah G.,
because I idolize her attitude.

1688
01:43:25,741 --> 01:43:27,992
- Oh. Okay.
- She’s so kind.

1689
01:43:27,993 --> 01:43:29,536
- Valid!
- You’re rushing it!

1690
01:43:29,786 --> 01:43:31,830
Who is more sulky between the two of you?

1691
01:43:32,789 --> 01:43:34,374
Wait a second!

1692
01:43:48,347 --> 01:43:50,557
Not true. Not true. Not true.

1693
01:43:50,700 --> 01:43:52,076
Not true?

1694
01:43:52,101 --> 01:43:52,852
Not true! For real!

1695
01:43:53,937 --> 01:43:56,605
He’s the more sulky one
between the two of you.

1696
01:43:57,564 --> 01:43:59,482
I wish we had more time.

1697
01:43:59,483 --> 01:44:02,402
But wait. What do you
do when you’re sulking?

1698
01:44:03,862 --> 01:44:05,279
Just one, last follow-up.

1699
01:44:05,280 --> 01:44:08,532
What do I do? I don’t sulk.

1700
01:44:08,533 --> 01:44:11,285
So I don’t really know.

1701
01:44:11,286 --> 01:44:13,663
Okay. Alright. If you say so.

1702
01:44:13,664 --> 01:44:15,457
- If you say so.
- If you say so.

1703
01:44:15,624 --> 01:44:17,417
That’s your story.

1704
01:44:18,710 --> 01:44:19,461
Okay.

1705
01:44:19,711 --> 01:44:21,754
Guys, let’s give a round of
applause for Ashtine and Andres!

1706
01:44:21,755 --> 01:44:23,547
I wish we have more time honestly,

1707
01:44:23,548 --> 01:44:24,590
So we can get through everything...

1708
01:44:24,591 --> 01:44:25,944
there are still so many questions left.

1709
01:44:25,968 --> 01:44:26,968
But, guys.

1710
01:44:27,052 --> 01:44:29,428
Thank you so, so much.
Those questions were intense!

1711
01:44:29,429 --> 01:44:30,429
Did you enjoy that?

1712
01:44:30,889 --> 01:44:32,556
Those questions were intense

1713
01:44:32,557 --> 01:44:36,812
and felt harder than a school recitation.

1714
01:44:37,145 --> 01:44:40,773
Again, thank you to Ashtine
and Andres for being so, so,

1715
01:44:40,774 --> 01:44:42,275
so game tonight.

1716
01:44:42,276 --> 01:44:45,278
Anything you wanna say to
all your supporters, brother?

1717
01:44:45,279 --> 01:44:46,487
Ah, go ahead, Ashtine.

1718
01:44:46,488 --> 01:44:47,822
Of course, thank you guys for coming

1719
01:44:47,823 --> 01:44:50,741
and thank you for all your questions.

1720
01:44:50,742 --> 01:44:54,663
We hope you enjoyed our
answers. Did you have fun?

1721
01:44:55,414 --> 01:44:56,414
Yay!

1722
01:44:57,040 --> 01:44:59,060
If you guys are happy

1723
01:44:59,085 --> 01:45:02,088
then me and Ashtine
are happy as well, right?

1724
01:45:03,505 --> 01:45:06,300
So thank you all. Thank
you so, so much again.

1725
01:45:10,887 --> 01:45:14,890
AshDres! AshDres! AshDres!

1726
01:45:14,891 --> 01:45:17,101
I support Ashdres!

1727
01:45:17,102 --> 01:45:18,185
We’re from Pampanga.

1728
01:45:18,186 --> 01:45:20,479
We even came all the
way there just to see them.

1729
01:45:20,480 --> 01:45:24,484
We love you, AshDres! Woo!

1730
01:45:24,818 --> 01:45:28,237
Ashdres is my bias because
their chemistry is so natural.

1731
01:45:28,238 --> 01:45:30,740
My bias is AshDres because

1732
01:45:30,741 --> 01:45:33,826
their moments are super duper sweet!

1733
01:45:33,827 --> 01:45:37,163
This is one of the adaptations I’ve seen

1734
01:45:37,164 --> 01:45:41,709
with truly clutch and on-point chemistry.

1735
01:45:41,710 --> 01:45:45,714
AshDres! AshDres! AshDres!

1736
01:46:05,734 --> 01:46:09,445
Let’s turn up the romance
tonight with more music!

1737
01:46:09,446 --> 01:46:12,949
He’s ready to knock on all our hearts!

1738
01:46:13,658 --> 01:46:16,703
NFT, are you ready?!

1739
01:46:18,038 --> 01:46:22,250
Make way for the singer-songwriter
and hitmaker—Rob Deniel!

1740
01:46:50,654 --> 01:46:51,654
1

1741
01:46:51,863 --> 01:46:52,863
2

1742
01:46:53,031 --> 01:46:55,534
1, 2, 3, 4!

1743
01:47:14,261 --> 01:47:19,724
It’s only now that I’ve found

1744
01:47:23,271 --> 01:47:28,985
the only weakness.

1745
01:47:30,902 --> 01:47:35,282
And as the moments pass.

1746
01:47:35,782 --> 01:47:39,244
I grow restless.

1747
01:47:39,786 --> 01:47:42,413
But with you...

1748
01:47:42,414 --> 01:47:46,167
I’m so, I’m so

1749
01:47:46,168 --> 01:47:51,797
excited to be with you at last.

1750
01:47:51,798 --> 01:47:55,634
So many, so many

1751
01:47:55,635 --> 01:47:58,304
are the kisses

1752
01:47:58,305 --> 01:48:03,101
since I found you.

1753
01:48:04,352 --> 01:48:08,106
Oh, oh, oh.

1754
01:48:09,941 --> 01:48:16,907
Love is the meaning.

1755
01:48:19,284 --> 01:48:26,749
I always have a way.

1756
01:48:26,750 --> 01:48:31,879
Why is it that Marvin and Jolina

1757
01:48:31,880 --> 01:48:36,926
are only together on screen?

1758
01:48:36,927 --> 01:48:38,928
But with you!

1759
01:48:38,929 --> 01:48:40,554
I am so, I am so

1760
01:48:40,555 --> 01:48:42,806
I am so, I am so

1761
01:48:42,807 --> 01:48:48,479
excited to finally be with you.

1762
01:48:48,480 --> 01:48:54,444
So, so many kisses.

1763
01:48:54,945 --> 01:49:00,699
When I finally found you.

1764
01:49:00,700 --> 01:49:08,700
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

1765
01:49:25,058 --> 01:49:30,062
It’s only once in a while I feel this way.

1766
01:49:30,063 --> 01:49:34,233
Only once again can I feel whole.

1767
01:49:34,234 --> 01:49:37,236
So just say it.

1768
01:49:37,237 --> 01:49:43,660
Say it now, my darling.

1769
01:49:44,995 --> 01:49:52,995
I’m so, so excited to finally be with you.

1770
01:49:53,336 --> 01:49:54,379
SING!

1771
01:49:55,046 --> 01:49:57,215
Alright!

1772
01:49:58,258 --> 01:50:02,178
I’m excited...

1773
01:50:03,263 --> 01:50:11,263
I’m so, so excited to finally be with you.

1774
01:50:13,189 --> 01:50:21,189
So, so many kisses
when I finally found you.

1775
01:50:26,077 --> 01:50:30,414
Oh, oh, oh.

1776
01:50:30,415 --> 01:50:34,002
To have found you...

1777
01:50:35,295 --> 01:50:42,260
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

1778
01:50:44,304 --> 01:50:48,892
Thank you!

1779
01:50:55,899 --> 01:50:56,941
Hi, everybody.

1780
01:50:58,401 --> 01:50:59,694
I’m Rob Deniel.

1781
01:51:01,404 --> 01:51:02,404
Ahh...

1782
01:51:02,989 --> 01:51:03,989
Hello!

1783
01:51:05,659 --> 01:51:06,659
So.

1784
01:51:08,078 --> 01:51:12,247
I just want to mention,
the upcoming concert with...

1785
01:51:12,248 --> 01:51:16,335
G-A-T. G-A-T. Earl Agustin, and Amiel Sol

1786
01:51:16,336 --> 01:51:22,257
for Mutya OST Live here
at the New Frontier Theater.

1787
01:51:22,258 --> 01:51:25,637
I’m inviting you all. See you there.

1788
01:51:26,137 --> 01:51:29,181
And this next song, I hope you all like it.

1789
01:51:29,182 --> 01:51:30,933
Uhmm..

1790
01:51:30,934 --> 01:51:33,561
This song is called Miss Miss, baby!

1791
01:51:40,735 --> 01:51:48,735
Let’s meet up, please. I always miss you...

1792
01:52:22,318 --> 01:52:27,949
Alright! 1, 2! 1, 2, 3, 4!

1793
01:52:43,673 --> 01:52:50,889
Holding your hands, my love.

1794
01:52:51,556 --> 01:52:58,187
Even if it’s just in my dreams.

1795
01:52:58,188 --> 01:53:02,775
I’m willing to take a chance,
willing to take a chance.

1796
01:53:02,776 --> 01:53:05,152
Just to see you.

1797
01:53:05,153 --> 01:53:08,155
Everybody sing!

1798
01:53:08,156 --> 01:53:10,991
Oh, where are you, my love?

1799
01:53:10,992 --> 01:53:11,992
WHAT?

1800
01:53:12,076 --> 01:53:16,206
My heart is already looking for you.

1801
01:53:16,372 --> 01:53:20,209
Baby, you’re really the only one

1802
01:53:20,210 --> 01:53:24,839
that I always miss, every single time.

1803
01:53:26,800 --> 01:53:31,304
Every single time.

1804
01:53:31,971 --> 01:53:36,433
And baby, I’ll be waiting.

1805
01:53:36,434 --> 01:53:44,434
And I’ll take you back
to the past, to the past.

1806
01:53:52,951 --> 01:53:57,996
Even if I’m far from you, my love.

1807
01:53:57,997 --> 01:54:01,583
Come home, no matter where you are.

1808
01:54:01,584 --> 01:54:06,213
I’ll pray just to see you.

1809
01:54:06,214 --> 01:54:09,174
Section E Nation!

1810
01:54:09,175 --> 01:54:11,677
Oh, where are you, my love?

1811
01:54:11,678 --> 01:54:12,886
WHAT?!

1812
01:54:12,887 --> 01:54:17,140
My heart is already looking for you.

1813
01:54:17,141 --> 01:54:21,562
Baby, you’re really the only one

1814
01:54:21,563 --> 01:54:26,359
that I always miss, every single time.

1815
01:54:27,652 --> 01:54:31,447
Every single time.

1816
01:54:33,449 --> 01:54:37,244
And baby, I will be waiting.

1817
01:54:37,245 --> 01:54:45,245
And I’ll take you back
to the past. To the past...

1818
01:54:47,714 --> 01:54:49,840
Shout it out already!

1819
01:54:49,841 --> 01:54:55,679
Oh, let’s meet up please

1820
01:54:55,680 --> 01:55:01,060
I always miss you, oh.

1821
01:55:06,232 --> 01:55:11,945
Oh, let’s meet up, please

1822
01:55:11,946 --> 01:55:17,076
I always miss you.

1823
01:55:34,594 --> 01:55:38,388
Everybody Sing! 1, 2, 3, 4!

1824
01:55:38,389 --> 01:55:42,726
Baby, you’re really the only one...

1825
01:55:42,727 --> 01:55:47,857
That I always miss, every single time.

1826
01:55:49,067 --> 01:55:52,820
Every single time.

1827
01:55:54,864 --> 01:55:58,742
And baby, I will be waiting.

1828
01:55:58,743 --> 01:56:06,743
And I’ll take you back to
the past. To the past... ohhhh!

1829
01:56:34,696 --> 01:56:35,738
Thank you everybody!

1830
01:56:47,291 --> 01:56:50,293
So much fun, it's exciting to perform

1831
01:56:50,294 --> 01:56:51,503
in front of people.

1832
01:56:51,504 --> 01:56:54,257
In front of the fans of
Ang Mutya ng Section E.

1833
01:56:54,674 --> 01:56:59,011
Well, of course especially
since my songs also became part

1834
01:56:59,012 --> 01:57:03,849
of this series, so it's a pleasure
to serve this song for them.

1835
01:57:03,850 --> 01:57:08,061
Congratulations to all of you!
Uh, I'm happy for you guys!

1836
01:57:08,062 --> 01:57:10,147
To everyone who was given a break.

1837
01:57:10,148 --> 01:57:13,191
To everyone who shined
throughout the series,

1838
01:57:13,192 --> 01:57:14,652
Congratulations! Salute!

1839
01:57:16,946 --> 01:57:20,825
Give it up for Rob Deniel,
ladies and gentlemen!

1840
01:57:21,576 --> 01:57:23,286
Did you enjoy that?

1841
01:57:24,454 --> 01:57:28,206
Wow, no one else can make
you swoon like Rob Deniel!

1842
01:57:28,207 --> 01:57:32,127
Now, to all of the fans of
Ang Mutya ng Section E

1843
01:57:32,128 --> 01:57:33,587
the fun continues

1844
01:57:33,588 --> 01:57:37,716
and you can head straight
to the after party at Viva Café.

1845
01:57:37,717 --> 01:57:39,259
So after this...

1846
01:57:39,260 --> 01:57:40,469
Yes, yes, yes.

1847
01:57:40,470 --> 01:57:43,805
After this, guys, once
we’ve wrapped up the event,

1848
01:57:43,806 --> 01:57:46,850
we can go straight to Viva
Café which is just nearby.

1849
01:57:46,851 --> 01:57:50,687
Enjoy a 30% off on your food orders.

1850
01:57:50,688 --> 01:57:54,274

available for a limited amout of time only.

1852
01:57:57,195 --> 01:58:02,157
Again, after this, head straight

1853
01:58:02,158 --> 01:58:03,451
You want more?

1854
01:58:04,952 --> 01:58:06,454
You want more?

1855
01:58:07,455 --> 01:58:10,457
And now, get ready to dance along

1856
01:58:10,458 --> 01:58:15,087
with somebody that's
so special for all of us.

1857
01:58:15,088 --> 01:58:17,548
Guess who this is, guys. Guess who.

1858
01:58:20,093 --> 01:58:21,551
You’ve already seen him in day one,

1859
01:58:21,552 --> 01:58:24,179
but I want you to shout and manifest.

1860
01:58:24,180 --> 01:58:25,598
Who is it?

1861
01:58:27,391 --> 01:58:29,060
Who?!

1862
01:58:30,476 --> 01:58:33,313
I can see that. That blue LED
you're holding. Is that it? You want it?

1863
01:58:33,314 --> 01:58:35,358
Is that it? You want it?

1864
01:58:36,734 --> 01:58:37,734
Okay.

1865
01:58:37,903 --> 01:58:39,361
Because you want it.

1866
01:58:39,403 --> 01:58:42,823
Get ready to dance
along with Yuri Hanamichi

1867
01:58:42,824 --> 01:58:45,492
of Ang Mutya ng Section E.

1868
01:58:45,493 --> 01:58:47,036
Rabin Angeles.

1869
01:58:53,835 --> 01:58:57,505
Of course, our Glam team is here.

1870
01:58:58,214 --> 01:58:59,340
This is Sir Mikey.

1871
01:59:03,886 --> 01:59:06,347
I look like a Tekken character, Jin Kazama.

1872
01:59:06,806 --> 01:59:08,599
- Jin Kazama.
- Jin Kazama.

1873
01:59:08,766 --> 01:59:12,103
Won't you say you love me? Oh-whoa.

1874
01:59:12,228 --> 01:59:15,565
Do you still love me?

1875
01:59:16,232 --> 01:59:19,569
Won't you say you need me? Oh.

1876
01:59:19,861 --> 01:59:22,487
Tell me what you're feeling

1877
01:59:22,488 --> 01:59:24,114
I haven’t danced in two years.

1878
01:59:24,115 --> 01:59:27,033
Coach Kevin made me
dance again with Daleng Dale.

1879
01:59:27,034 --> 01:59:29,411
And now he even made me a
choreography for Say You Love Me.

1880
01:59:29,412 --> 01:59:31,164
- What can you say, coach?
- What can I say?

1881
01:59:31,539 --> 01:59:31,914
Uhmm.

1882
01:59:32,498 --> 01:59:36,209
First, Rabin always tells me,

1883
01:59:36,210 --> 01:59:38,295
"Coach, I really don't know how to dance."

1884
01:59:38,296 --> 01:59:41,006
But when we started our sessions,

1885
01:59:41,007 --> 01:59:43,925
I saw that Rabin really
has potential in dancing

1886
01:59:43,926 --> 01:59:46,470
because he's a fast learner.

1887
01:59:47,096 --> 01:59:50,349
Of course, his execution
still needs improvement.

1888
01:59:51,434 --> 01:59:55,353
And, um, just wait and see
what kind of surprise Rabin

1889
01:59:55,354 --> 01:59:56,980
will bring because you’ll be shocked.

1890
01:59:56,981 --> 02:00:01,319
Watch out for what the result of this
Say You Love Me number will be.

1891
02:00:03,446 --> 02:00:04,906
Adjust to your left.

1892
02:00:08,784 --> 02:00:10,535
And… hold on!

1893
02:00:10,536 --> 02:00:12,580
I’ll leave it up to you
guys. I’ll just do my best.

1894
02:00:13,581 --> 02:00:16,125
Won't you say you love me? Oh.

1895
02:00:17,126 --> 02:00:20,921
Do you still love me?

1896
02:00:20,922 --> 02:00:24,925
Won't you say you need me? Oh.

1897
02:00:24,926 --> 02:00:28,803
Tell me what you're feeling.

1898
02:00:28,804 --> 02:00:32,390
It seems you no longer feel anything.

1899
02:00:32,391 --> 02:00:36,311
Whenever I hold your hand.

1900
02:00:36,312 --> 02:00:40,190
Seems like I'm no longer the one.

1901
02:00:40,191 --> 02:00:44,153
In your heart and mind, unlike before.

1902
02:00:45,238 --> 02:00:50,575
Why do you look at me
differently from before.

1903
02:00:50,576 --> 02:00:54,829
Has something changed? Tell me.

1904
02:00:54,830 --> 02:01:00,585
Doesn't seem so, that's what I thought
But people are right.

1905
02:01:00,586 --> 02:01:02,295
Someone else makes you happy now.

1906
02:01:02,296 --> 02:01:04,214
You hang out with different men.

1907
02:01:04,215 --> 02:01:06,049
One time I even caught you.

1908
02:01:06,050 --> 02:01:08,009
Hugging another guy, laughing.

1909
02:01:08,010 --> 02:01:11,721
That's it, I still haven't
learned my lesson.

1910
02:01:11,722 --> 02:01:13,683
But why is that?

1911
02:01:13,724 --> 02:01:15,684
Baby, thanks but no thanks.

1912
02:01:15,685 --> 02:01:22,482
Won't you say you love me? Oh
Do you still love me?

1913
02:01:22,483 --> 02:01:26,319
Won't you say you need me? Oh.

1914
02:01:26,320 --> 02:01:30,073
Tell me what you're feeling.

1915
02:01:30,074 --> 02:01:34,035
It seems you no longer feel anything.

1916
02:01:34,036 --> 02:01:37,831
Whenever I hold your hand.

1917
02:01:37,832 --> 02:01:41,668
Seems like I'm no longer the one.

1918
02:01:41,669 --> 02:01:45,589
In your heart and mind, unlike before.

1919
02:01:47,133 --> 02:01:50,719
I hate what happened

1920
02:01:50,720 --> 02:01:55,140
A lot has happened that I didn't
know

1921
02:01:55,141 --> 02:01:58,852
What should I do with you?

1922
02:01:58,853 --> 02:02:03,273
Should I believe you?
What am I even fighting for?

1923
02:02:03,274 --> 02:02:06,192
Don't wanna recall the past.

1924
02:02:06,193 --> 02:02:10,155
When I dream of you, it hurts.

1925
02:02:10,156 --> 02:02:13,908
But when I wake up, I yearn for you.

1926
02:02:13,909 --> 02:02:15,910
Wanna love you again.

1927
02:02:15,911 --> 02:02:17,203
Only to find out.

1928
02:02:17,204 --> 02:02:19,080
Someone else makes you happy now.

1929
02:02:19,081 --> 02:02:20,874
You hang out with different men.

1930
02:02:20,875 --> 02:02:23,168
One time I even caught you.

1931
02:02:23,169 --> 02:02:24,711
Hugging another guy, laughing.

1932
02:02:24,712 --> 02:02:28,506
That's it, I still haven't
learned my lesson.

1933
02:02:28,507 --> 02:02:30,592
But why is that?

1934
02:02:30,593 --> 02:02:31,801
Baby, thanks but no thanks.

1935
02:02:31,802 --> 02:02:35,305
Won't you say you love me? Oh.

1936
02:02:35,306 --> 02:02:39,267
Do you still love me?

1937
02:02:39,268 --> 02:02:43,063
Won't you say you need me? Oh.

1938
02:02:43,064 --> 02:02:46,941
Tell me what you're feeling.

1939
02:02:46,942 --> 02:02:50,820
It seems you no longer feel anything.

1940
02:02:50,821 --> 02:02:54,824
Whenever I hold your hand.

1941
02:02:54,825 --> 02:02:58,244
Seems like I'm no longer the one.

1942
02:02:58,245 --> 02:03:02,416
In your heart and mind, unlike before.

1943
02:03:03,834 --> 02:03:08,047
Why do you look at me
differently from before.

1944
02:03:26,690 --> 02:03:30,026
There it is!

1945
02:03:30,027 --> 02:03:32,279
I danced to “Say You Love Me” by Alamat.

1946
02:03:34,115 --> 02:03:35,908
NFT, I have a favor to ask.

1947
02:03:38,828 --> 02:03:40,246
Can you say you love me?

1948
02:03:45,292 --> 02:03:47,002
Section E Nation!

1949
02:03:48,629 --> 02:03:51,507
Make some noise for the
Ang Mutya of Section E herself,

1950
02:03:52,675 --> 02:03:56,762
Jasper “Jay-jay” Fernandez Mariano.

1951
02:03:57,138 --> 02:03:58,347
Ashtine Olviga!

1952
02:04:04,103 --> 02:04:06,856
You have a marker here,
move a little downstage.

1953
02:04:08,441 --> 02:04:09,525
Not aligned.

1954
02:04:10,234 --> 02:04:12,485
Alright, just move forward. Thank you.

1955
02:04:12,486 --> 02:04:14,028
Take that marker. Go ahead.

1956
02:04:14,029 --> 02:04:19,159
So, one of my preparations
is to keep my mind alive

1957
02:04:19,160 --> 02:04:20,660
so I don’t get sleepy...

1958
02:04:20,661 --> 02:04:23,580
so that when Direk gives
instructions, like earlier

1959
02:04:23,581 --> 02:04:25,707
when some parts were changed...

1960
02:04:25,708 --> 02:04:29,545
I stay alert and make
sure I’m always hyper.

1961
02:04:30,254 --> 02:04:33,006
Yes! Thank you so, so much.

1962
02:04:33,007 --> 02:04:36,010
Wow, aren’t you tired of us yet?

1963
02:04:39,305 --> 02:04:41,723
We’re getting ready for our show tonight.

1964
02:04:41,724 --> 02:04:44,559
We just finished the run-through for...

1965
02:04:44,560 --> 02:04:46,227
for the entire show.

1966
02:04:46,228 --> 02:04:49,898
And yeah, it’s really
exhausting but also really fun.

1967
02:04:49,899 --> 02:04:51,941
Thank you so, so much for watching.

1968
02:04:51,942 --> 02:04:54,110
Thank you for lining up early

1969
02:04:54,111 --> 02:04:57,030
for buying tickets. Thank
you, thank you so much.

1970
02:04:57,031 --> 02:05:00,034
And I hope you all enjoy our show.

1971
02:05:17,092 --> 02:05:20,136
When the world is chaotic.

1972
02:05:20,137 --> 02:05:27,228
You’re the peace I’m searching for.

1973
02:05:30,564 --> 02:05:38,564
My heart is pounding again.

1974
02:05:44,495 --> 02:05:48,289
With the worries.

1975
02:05:48,290 --> 02:05:54,255
That the world brings.

1976
02:05:58,509 --> 02:06:04,974
With so much happening.

1977
02:06:05,558 --> 02:06:10,187
Where else can I turn?

1978
02:06:12,314 --> 02:06:15,942
But to you.

1979
02:06:15,943 --> 02:06:23,943
Only you I’ll hold on to.

1980
02:06:26,287 --> 02:06:29,831
When the world is chaotic.

1981
02:06:29,832 --> 02:06:36,380
You’re the peace I’m searching for.

1982
02:06:40,217 --> 02:06:43,386
Run to me too.

1983
02:06:43,387 --> 02:06:51,311
When your heart feels heavy.

1984
02:06:51,312 --> 02:06:55,899
I’ll be there to welcome you.

1985
02:06:59,486 --> 02:07:05,200
Ooohh.

1986
02:07:08,037 --> 02:07:16,037
I want to grow together with you.

1987
02:07:21,759 --> 02:07:29,759
And let’s glance at our future.

1988
02:07:36,732 --> 02:07:44,732
You’re the only one, my rest.

1989
02:07:49,995 --> 02:07:56,376
To you I wake, and to you I sleep.

1990
02:07:56,377 --> 02:08:01,923
With you, my world keeps spinning.

1991
02:08:01,924 --> 02:08:03,633
Sing with me.

1992
02:08:03,634 --> 02:08:07,303
When the world is chaotic.

1993
02:08:07,304 --> 02:08:14,895
You’re the peace I’m searching for.

1994
02:08:17,481 --> 02:08:21,693
Run to me too.

1995
02:08:21,694 --> 02:08:28,909
When your heart feels heavy.

1996
02:08:31,412 --> 02:08:35,164
You’re part of every prayer.

1997
02:08:35,165 --> 02:08:41,839
You’re the rest in every moment.

1998
02:08:45,509 --> 02:08:48,928
My voice is heading to you.

1999
02:08:48,929 --> 02:08:55,686
And the beat only says one thing.

2000
02:08:56,687 --> 02:09:03,651
I’ll be there to welcome you.

2001
02:09:03,652 --> 02:09:10,325
Ooohh.

2002
02:09:14,580 --> 02:09:22,580
Ooohh.

2003
02:09:28,177 --> 02:09:30,303
When the world is chaotic.

2004
02:09:30,304 --> 02:09:36,310
You’re the peace I’m searching for.

2005
02:09:41,273 --> 02:09:44,442
Run to me too.

2006
02:09:44,443 --> 02:09:52,443
When your heart feels heavy.

2007
02:09:55,412 --> 02:10:01,334
With just one glance from you.

2008
02:10:01,335 --> 02:10:08,841
It’s like you’re hugging me.

2009
02:10:08,842 --> 02:10:14,932
And the world feels lighter.

2010
02:10:18,060 --> 02:10:19,310
NFT!

2011
02:10:19,311 --> 02:10:20,561
Andres Muhlach!

2012
02:10:20,562 --> 02:10:23,106
You really surprised me there!

2013
02:10:25,400 --> 02:10:26,442
Were you surprised?

2014
02:10:26,443 --> 02:10:28,195
But I was more surprised by your face!

2015
02:10:28,946 --> 02:10:30,489
Handsome, right?!

2016
02:10:32,157 --> 02:10:33,742
So thrilling!

2017
02:10:35,869 --> 02:10:37,120
Uhhm.

2018
02:10:40,707 --> 02:10:43,418
Looks like it's my turn to sing, right?

2019
02:10:43,877 --> 02:10:45,294
You agree, Ash?

2020
02:10:45,295 --> 02:10:46,380
Right, right!

2021
02:11:00,978 --> 02:11:03,229
Follow on third. You’re on the third count.

2022
02:11:03,230 --> 02:11:05,064
I’ll take care of the
blocking or the dance.

2023
02:11:05,065 --> 02:11:05,941
Oh, wait.

2024
02:11:05,942 --> 02:11:07,400
Oh, looks like I need to go in.

2025
02:11:07,401 --> 02:11:08,401
Wait.

2026
02:11:08,443 --> 02:11:09,819
Maybe not yet, guys.

2027
02:11:09,820 --> 02:11:11,237
So yeah guys, as you can see,

2028
02:11:11,238 --> 02:11:12,363
very...

2029
02:11:12,364 --> 02:11:14,532
I’m very well prepared now.

2030
02:11:14,533 --> 02:11:17,702
My mindset is really present.

2031
02:11:17,703 --> 02:11:19,913
I’m right here.

2032
02:11:20,205 --> 02:11:23,583
Section E Nation, later. Tonight, 8pm.

2033
02:11:23,584 --> 02:11:26,586
Thank you everyone that’s
gonna come later and watch.

2034
02:11:26,587 --> 02:11:28,921
I want to thank each
and every one of you truly

2035
02:11:28,922 --> 02:11:30,256
from the bottom of my heart.

2036
02:11:30,257 --> 02:11:33,259
Everyone that came and
traveled to support us today.

2037
02:11:33,260 --> 02:11:35,428
And even the people
that can’t join us today

2038
02:11:35,429 --> 02:11:37,109
and have joined us throughout the season.

2039
02:11:37,764 --> 02:11:40,099
Thank you so much to all of you.

2040
02:11:40,100 --> 02:11:44,061
Each and every one of you.
You all played a role in this show.

2041
02:11:44,062 --> 02:11:45,897
Not just all of us in the
show and in the production.

2042
02:11:45,898 --> 02:11:47,690
But you guys also, the viewers, you guys

2043
02:11:47,691 --> 02:11:50,776
all helped us. And for
that we are forever grateful.

2044
02:11:50,777 --> 02:11:54,906
You are the Miss Universe

2045
02:11:54,907 --> 02:11:58,577
of my life.

2046
02:12:00,913 --> 02:12:05,833
Of my life.

2047
02:12:05,834 --> 02:12:07,835
Standby to blackout.

2048
02:12:07,836 --> 02:12:09,879
Get closer to her and…

2049
02:12:09,880 --> 02:12:11,465
then blackout.

2050
02:12:23,185 --> 02:12:30,901
You are the Miss Universe of my life.

2051
02:12:34,488 --> 02:12:42,488
How many times do I have to tell you.

2052
02:12:44,957 --> 02:12:50,753
When I'm with you, the sorrow disappears.

2053
02:12:50,754 --> 02:12:56,801
Even happiness has no equal.

2054
02:12:56,802 --> 02:13:04,802
You are the Miss Universe of my life.

2055
02:13:18,991 --> 02:13:26,991
How many times do I have to tell you.

2056
02:13:29,584 --> 02:13:35,256
Headaches go away instantly.

2057
02:13:35,257 --> 02:13:41,595
When I'm with you, the sorrow disappears.

2058
02:13:41,596 --> 02:13:49,596
You are the Miss Universe of my life.

2059
02:13:50,439 --> 02:13:58,439
What would I do with the beauty of others?

2060
02:14:01,658 --> 02:14:07,413
It’ll just make my eyes go cross-eyed

2061
02:14:07,414 --> 02:14:12,334
and my pockets will become empty.

2062
02:14:12,335 --> 02:14:18,174
And didn’t the elders say.

2063
02:14:18,175 --> 02:14:24,555
We kids should be careful.

2064
02:14:24,556 --> 02:14:32,556
Beauty is like luck, it fades away.

2065
02:14:37,110 --> 02:14:45,110
You are the Miss Universe of my life.

2066
02:14:48,538 --> 02:14:56,538
How many times do I
have to repeat it to you.

2067
02:15:01,676 --> 02:15:09,676
It's crystal clear, today and any day.

2068
02:15:10,685 --> 02:15:18,685
You are the Miss Universe of my life.

2069
02:15:22,614 --> 02:15:30,614
You are the Miss Universe of my life

2070
02:15:31,832 --> 02:15:39,005
of my life.

2071
02:15:47,055 --> 02:15:50,808
Whoo, amazing.

2072
02:15:50,809 --> 02:15:53,812
Let’s give it up for Andres Muhlach.

2073
02:15:56,815 --> 02:15:59,108
I have something to say, just one thing.

2074
02:15:59,109 --> 02:16:01,026
Your voice actually sounds even better

2075
02:16:01,027 --> 02:16:02,528
when you're using a microphone.

2076
02:16:02,529 --> 02:16:05,532
Do you guys agree? Right?

2077
02:16:06,449 --> 02:16:09,076
But here's the thing, this is
what everyone's been asking.

2078
02:16:09,077 --> 02:16:13,498
Who really is the Miss
Universe of your life?

2079
02:16:16,293 --> 02:16:18,962
Looks like you already
know the answer, huh?

2080
02:16:22,382 --> 02:16:23,382
Wait a second.

2081
02:16:24,092 --> 02:16:29,763
New Frontier Theater. Who is
really the Miss Universe of my life?

2082
02:16:29,764 --> 02:16:31,307
Who? Who?

2083
02:16:31,308 --> 02:16:33,309
Wait a second. Wait a second.

2084
02:16:33,310 --> 02:16:35,870
I have something to say too. I
have something I want to say too.

2085
02:16:36,062 --> 02:16:38,314
- Oh?
- Ah, this is an adlib.

2086
02:16:38,315 --> 02:16:39,566
This is new.

2087
02:16:40,192 --> 02:16:42,151
From the very start,

2088
02:16:42,152 --> 02:16:48,074
I just wanted to say, Ash, thank
you so, so much. You know,

2089
02:16:49,576 --> 02:16:51,368
getting the opportunity to work with you

2090
02:16:51,369 --> 02:16:53,356
you know, it’s always a blessing.

2091
02:16:53,381 --> 02:16:56,999
And I think I speak for
everybody in the cast

2092
02:16:57,000 --> 02:16:59,678
you really made it a
lot easier for all of us.

2093
02:16:59,961 --> 02:17:04,507
And truly, there would be no
Section E without the Mutya herself.

2094
02:17:04,713 --> 02:17:05,713
Right?

2095
02:17:06,885 --> 02:17:09,845
- That’s really touching.
- I’m very proud of you.

2096
02:17:09,846 --> 02:17:11,264
Are you proud of Ash?

2097
02:17:13,183 --> 02:17:16,644
Thank you, thank you. But there it is,

2098
02:17:16,645 --> 02:17:20,691
if I’m the Miss Universe of
life, I feel like I lack the height.

2099
02:17:20,716 --> 02:17:22,801
Right, right?

2100
02:17:23,168 --> 02:17:24,361
Right?

2101
02:17:26,738 --> 02:17:30,950
Okay! Whoo! That’s enough,
that’s enough, that’s enough.

2102
02:17:30,951 --> 02:17:35,246
So, the 16 episodes of Mutya
ng Section E have ended.

2103
02:17:35,247 --> 02:17:38,123
And we can’t thank you
enough for the love and support

2104
02:17:38,124 --> 02:17:39,625
that you’ve given us.

2105
02:17:39,626 --> 02:17:43,921
From the announcement of
this project, to the pilot episode,

2106
02:17:43,922 --> 02:17:48,677
until the very last episode.
Wow, you never let us go.

2107
02:17:50,303 --> 02:17:52,680
You know, as they say,

2108
02:17:52,681 --> 02:17:59,311
Season 2! Season 2!

2109
02:17:59,312 --> 02:18:00,813
Wait a second.

2110
02:18:00,814 --> 02:18:04,859
As they say, some good
things must come to an end.

2111
02:18:07,237 --> 02:18:08,946
Wait again.

2112
02:18:08,947 --> 02:18:11,949
We had a good run, but we
can’t thank you guys enough.

2113
02:18:11,950 --> 02:18:14,743
But we still want to extend
our heartfelt gratitude

2114
02:18:14,744 --> 02:18:16,787
to our bosses from Viva,

2115
02:18:16,788 --> 02:18:19,081
especially Boss Vic,

2116
02:18:20,542 --> 02:18:25,129
and to Direk Ted for allowing
us to take on this journey.

2117
02:18:25,130 --> 02:18:29,550
And we also like to thank Ate Lara Flores,

2118
02:18:29,551 --> 02:18:32,011
the author of this Wattpad series,

2119
02:18:32,012 --> 02:18:35,764
"Ang Mutya ng Section E."
Ate Lara, congratulations!

2120
02:18:35,765 --> 02:18:38,225
And of course, to the
entire crew and staff of.

2121
02:18:38,226 --> 02:18:40,978
Ang Mutya ng Section E, thank
you so much for all your hard work.

2122
02:18:40,979 --> 02:18:43,982
Whoo! We made it!

2123
02:18:45,734 --> 02:18:46,984
Yes.

2124
02:18:46,985 --> 02:18:49,987
That's right.

2125
02:18:49,988 --> 02:18:51,238
Yes.

2126
02:18:51,239 --> 02:18:56,910
We’d also like to thank the Wattpad
Philippines team, headed by Mr. Ryan Benitez.

2127
02:18:56,911 --> 02:18:59,164
Thank you so, so much!

2128
02:19:02,125 --> 02:19:09,465
Yes, guys. With that being said, we’re
officially closing this chapter. And… and…

2129
02:19:09,466 --> 02:19:15,179
And… after our 16 episodes,

2130
02:19:15,180 --> 02:19:20,351
we move forward with hearts full
of gratitude and happy memories.

2131
02:19:20,352 --> 02:19:22,227
Thank you so much to all of you.

2132
02:19:22,228 --> 02:19:26,648
So here we are now, in our
ultimate fan meet and greet show.

2133
02:19:26,649 --> 02:19:30,235
You guys are amazing—two sold-out shows!

2134
02:19:30,236 --> 02:19:34,198
So thank you, thank you, thank
you so much to Team Day One,

2135
02:19:34,199 --> 02:19:37,659
for making history with
us. We are so, so grateful.

2136
02:19:37,660 --> 02:19:39,817
And of course, special
thanks to the director of

2137
02:19:39,841 --> 02:19:43,693
our fan meet and greet
show, Direk Paul Basinillo.

2138
02:19:43,718 --> 02:19:47,268
Thank you so much, Direk.
We truly appreciate you.

2139
02:19:50,090 --> 02:19:53,675
Aww! We love you too!

2140
02:19:53,996 --> 02:19:56,999
I feel like I have something
else to say again…

2141
02:19:59,682 --> 02:20:01,513
Section E Nation,

2142
02:20:01,976 --> 02:20:05,814
are you ready to create
new happy memories with us?

2143
02:20:08,775 --> 02:20:10,944
We have a surprise for you all!

2144
02:20:12,487 --> 02:20:14,530
Okay!

2145
02:20:14,531 --> 02:20:18,076
Let's all watch this!

2146
02:20:25,792 --> 02:20:27,752
You think you can kick
me out of your section?

2147
02:20:28,795 --> 02:20:30,755
In your dreams!

2148
02:20:35,500 --> 02:20:38,039
I'll make her fall in love with me.

2149
02:20:38,346 --> 02:20:40,614
Then, I'll break her heart.

2150
02:20:41,488 --> 02:20:44,143
What are you doing? I'll carry you!

2151
02:20:44,168 --> 02:20:44,919
Cow!

2152
02:20:45,104 --> 02:20:47,479
Where? Where’s the cow?

2153
02:20:47,504 --> 02:20:48,504
No!

2154
02:20:51,740 --> 02:20:53,027
You jerk!

2155
02:20:54,736 --> 02:20:59,751
Just breathe. Just breathe.
Just breathe, Jay. I'm here.

2156
02:20:59,776 --> 02:21:02,986
Let’s go. Jay, Jay-Jay! You need to go!

2157
02:21:03,037 --> 02:21:04,580
Yuri, I have to do this!

2158
02:21:04,581 --> 02:21:07,584
Section E!

2159
02:21:09,836 --> 02:21:11,546
Let me go.

2160
02:21:12,725 --> 02:21:15,550
Jay, why can't you just answer my question?

2161
02:21:17,004 --> 02:21:18,672
Do you like Yuri?

2162
02:21:58,176 --> 02:21:59,510
Are you my brother?

2163
02:21:59,511 --> 02:22:01,637
You've been face-to-face
with your brother for so long.

2164
02:22:01,638 --> 02:22:03,847
And you still haven’t told
him the truth, have you?

2165
02:22:03,848 --> 02:22:07,540
I’m sorry. I still really can’t remember.

2166
02:22:07,565 --> 02:22:11,568
I’d only end up scarring Jay-Jay
the same way my father scarred us.

2167
02:22:11,731 --> 02:22:13,092
Especially Keagan.

2168
02:22:16,354 --> 02:22:17,562
From the start, right?

2169
02:22:17,587 --> 02:22:18,827
You already wanted to hurt her.

2170
02:22:19,739 --> 02:22:21,884
You were planning to hurt her
from the beginning, weren’t you?

2171
02:22:21,908 --> 02:22:22,908
Yuri,

2172
02:22:25,203 --> 02:22:28,289
Don’t let her come here.
I don’t want to see her.

2173
02:23:16,129 --> 02:23:17,838
That’s Season 2!

2174
02:23:17,839 --> 02:23:20,841
Season 2, let’s go!

2175
02:23:20,842 --> 02:23:23,260
Oh my gosh, see you in Season 2!

2176
02:23:23,261 --> 02:23:24,928
We’re really going to go all out now!

2177
02:23:24,929 --> 02:23:26,388
Wallets will be emptied!

2178
02:23:26,389 --> 02:23:28,348
This is crazy!

2179
02:23:28,349 --> 02:23:31,351
Season 2 is secured!

2180
02:23:31,352 --> 02:23:32,352
We’re shocked.

2181
02:23:32,353 --> 02:23:35,981
We honestly didn’t expect there’d
be a Season 2. So I’m really excited!

2182
02:23:35,982 --> 02:23:38,859
So much! I was literally
jumping on my seat.

2183
02:23:38,860 --> 02:23:41,445
Yes, we’re really looking
forward to Season 2,

2184
02:23:41,446 --> 02:23:45,282
and wow, we’re so grateful we
got to witness the announcement.

2185
02:23:45,283 --> 02:23:48,410
I feel like there’ll be a lot of
tragic moments… and action, too.

2186
02:23:48,411 --> 02:23:52,456
And the production team and
editing will be even more leveled up.

2187
02:23:52,457 --> 02:23:57,044
I really read all the books, so I’m
excited to see their adaptation again.

2188
02:23:57,045 --> 02:23:59,546
Thank you so much, Viva!

2189
02:23:59,547 --> 02:24:02,884
Super exciting! Oh my gosh!
We’ll be watching out for this!

2190
02:24:03,134 --> 02:24:05,886
Please stream it legally,
we’re begging you! Right?

2191
02:24:05,887 --> 02:24:09,681
Stream legally—we got a
second season because of YOU!

Are you guys happy?

2198

What do you think, Ash?

2199
02:25:01,360 --> 02:25:04,069
That felt like the biggest
plot twist of the night.

2200
02:25:04,070 --> 02:25:05,112
Yes!

2201
02:25:05,113 --> 02:25:09,157
