11
00:01:17,667 --> 00:01:19,833
   

12
00:01:21,367 --> 00:01:23,767
   

13
00:01:23,767 --> 00:01:27,600
   

14
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:32,267
   

15
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:39,333
What do you mean by that?

16
00:01:39,333 --> 00:01:41,967
Our Shin…

17
00:01:41,967 --> 00:01:43,333
This…

18
00:01:46,067 --> 00:01:48,400
I mean,

19
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,133
Shin is…

20
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:55,300
Yes, the matter that you are concerned about, sir…

21
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:56,433
Yes, don't worry, sir.

22
00:01:56,433 --> 00:01:58,367
Yes, thank you.

23
00:01:58,367 --> 00:02:01,667
Yes, yes.

24
00:02:02,867 --> 00:02:04,333
Jeez.

25
00:02:04,333 --> 00:02:07,300
Oh my.

26
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,133
What happened?

27
00:02:11,133 --> 00:02:13,800
And what about that photo posted on social media?

28
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,800
Because a stalker followed him.

29
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:28,767
How could they spread it immediately?

30
00:02:28,767 --> 00:02:31,867
That's why I said we should report it to the police immediately.

31
00:02:35,367 --> 00:02:39,833
Was it really Shin who pushed you?

32
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,200
Do you have any information about that stalker?

33
00:02:51,633 --> 00:02:54,667
They said that the social media account is illegal, and the phone is a burner,

34
00:02:54,667 --> 00:02:56,400
so tracking it is impossible.

35
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,233
The worst stalker has latched onto him.

36
00:02:58,233 --> 00:03:01,033
We need to find Shin first.

37
00:03:01,033 --> 00:03:02,167
He hasn't been answering the phone.

38
00:03:02,167 --> 00:03:04,933
He left his phone at the café.

39
00:03:04,933 --> 00:03:07,333
Just a moment, please.

40
00:03:07,333 --> 00:03:10,100
Shin wears a smartwatch 24/7.

41
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:13,400
His phone probably has a record of his movements.

42
00:03:18,967 --> 00:03:23,033
   

43
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:32,000
No, no.

44
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,333
No, no, Shin!

45
00:03:33,333 --> 00:03:34,867
Shin, no, no!

46
00:03:34,867 --> 00:03:36,400
You have several commercial shoots scheduled right now!

47
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,867
No, Shin! Shin!

48
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:43,533
Oh?

49
00:03:43,533 --> 00:03:45,167
He's alive!

50
00:03:47,467 --> 00:03:48,833
I don't have to compensate the advertiser for the deposit.

51
00:03:48,833 --> 00:03:50,733
Hooray for the police!

52
00:03:52,533 --> 00:03:54,600
Can we check where he is?

53
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:58,167
We don't have the authority to investigate a simple adult runaway.

54
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,500
Simple runaway?

55
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:04,233
What if this stalker finds Shin and harms him?

56
00:04:04,233 --> 00:04:05,700
Can you take the responsibility?

57
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:07,000
Do you think you can handle it?

58
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,533
Since the stalker never actually made threats,

59
00:04:09,533 --> 00:04:12,000
it seems difficult to consider it a dangerous situation.

60
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,767
For now, an investigation is underway for violation of the anti-stalking law.

61
00:04:14,767 --> 00:04:16,600
If this involves attempted murder, what happens?

62
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,733
Pardon?

63
00:04:18,733 --> 00:04:20,800
Hey, are you crazy?

64
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:25,933
So, you're saying Player Lee Shin actually pushed you?

65
00:04:25,933 --> 00:04:29,867
Find him and ask Lee Shin directly.

66
00:04:29,867 --> 00:04:31,967
No, no. What am I supposed to do if you go on like this?

67
00:04:31,967 --> 00:04:34,400
Hey! Did you just say Shin is…

68
00:04:35,667 --> 00:04:39,767
No, Shin isn't that kind of person.

69
00:05:18,667 --> 00:05:22,733
 The phone is powered off, connecting to voicemail… 

70
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:42,400
 This is the first message from the Sound Service. 

71
00:05:43,533 --> 00:05:47,500
 Lee Shin, stop acting like a child and sort it out yourself. 

72
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:50,633
 Or you'll live your life as an attempted murderer. 

73
00:05:50,633 --> 00:05:55,633
 I have all the footage of the accident, so don't hide like a coward and come out. 

74
00:06:20,633 --> 00:06:22,133
 Hey, Lee Shin! 

75
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:19,767
 You feel like you're the only one who sacrificed. Right? 

76
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:23,300
 You must be thinking if you hadn't saved that guy, 

77
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:28,333
 everything he enjoys now would be yours? 

78
00:07:28,333 --> 00:07:29,867
 Isn't that so? 

79
00:07:33,633 --> 00:07:35,733
 Shut up. 

80
00:07:35,733 --> 00:07:38,033
 What should I give back? 

81
00:07:38,033 --> 00:07:40,267
 The money sponsored by corporations? 

82
00:07:40,267 --> 00:07:44,067
 Or the title of a national hero? 

83
00:07:44,067 --> 00:07:46,733
 Surely, you're not a child. 

84
00:07:46,733 --> 00:07:49,300
 So it wouldn't be about the attention and love of the parents. Right? 

85
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:51,167
 I told you to shut up. 

86
00:07:51,167 --> 00:07:53,667
 If you want to hit me, hit me. 

87
00:07:53,667 --> 00:07:56,433
 Why? Are you scared I'll tell Mom? 

88
00:07:56,433 --> 00:07:57,800
 You bastard. 

89
00:08:08,467 --> 00:08:10,400
 Pathetic bastard. 

90
00:08:12,967 --> 00:08:15,000
 Do you think I'm an easy target? 

91
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,400
 Do I look easy to deal with because I live in your shadow? 

92
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:23,333
 Do you think I don't know your dark intentions? 

93
00:08:23,333 --> 00:08:28,533
 You've wanted to take… take everything of mine all your life. 

94
00:08:28,533 --> 00:08:30,200
 Isn't that so? 

95
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:33,300
 Here we go again. 

96
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:35,367
 It's exhausting. It tires me. 

97
00:08:36,733 --> 00:08:39,367
 Self-pity and inferiority complex. 

98
00:08:40,633 --> 00:08:44,133
 You think you're the most pitiful person in the world, don't you? 

99
00:08:44,133 --> 00:08:45,533
 Stop throwing tantrums. 

100
00:08:45,533 --> 00:08:47,300
 You bastard… 

101
00:08:58,167 --> 00:09:00,133
 You feel like you're the only one who sacrificed. Right? 

102
00:09:00,133 --> 00:09:03,700
 Have you ever thought about how I've lived just to pursue your shattered dreams? 

103
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:07,200
 I'm not you to begin with. 

104
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,933
 "Your brother can do it, but why can't you do better than this?" 

105
00:09:09,933 --> 00:09:13,467
 "To be like your brother, you have to do twice, three times more." 

106
00:09:13,467 --> 00:09:15,800
 Even when the pus in my palms turns into blood, 

107
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:20,100
 and the blisters on my soles become clotted with blood, until the cartilage wears away. 

108
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:23,800
 I had no time to cry from sadness, and I had to run endlessly. 

109
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:26,733
 Even though I live with obsessive-compulsive disorder and panic disorder medication, 

110
00:09:26,733 --> 00:09:30,833
 I can't admit when I'm in pain… Like a well-trained beast! 

111
00:09:30,833 --> 00:09:35,133
 I was raised like a robot without pain. 

112
00:09:35,133 --> 00:09:38,700
 Those looks, that attention, and those expectations! 

113
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:43,000
 It's suffocating. 

114
00:09:49,033 --> 00:09:51,033
 Then don't do it. 

115
00:09:52,633 --> 00:09:55,133
 It seems you're under some misconception. 

116
00:09:55,133 --> 00:09:58,467
 I never asked you to live my life for me. 

117
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:03,267
 Live the way you want to. 

118
00:10:04,967 --> 00:10:07,900
 Don't whine while enjoying everything you have. 

119
00:10:10,233 --> 00:10:12,267
 Do you even know what you want for yourself? 

120
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,600
 What? 

121
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:19,733
 You're just a copycat who has always followed me. 

122
00:10:58,267 --> 00:11:01,167
 Hey, Lee Shin. 

123
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:08,700
 I'm so tired. 

124
00:11:09,333 --> 00:11:12,020
 I just want to rest now. 

125
00:11:15,933 --> 00:11:18,233
 Lee Shin! 

126
00:11:31,833 --> 00:11:34,433
 It's the right hand, isn't it? 

127
00:11:34,433 --> 00:11:37,433
 Looks like it's not hurting anymore? 

128
00:11:37,433 --> 00:11:41,167
 Hold onto my arm tightly, Lee Shin. 

129
00:11:44,367 --> 00:11:47,033
 Is it the first time in 15 years 

130
00:11:47,033 --> 00:11:49,367
 that you've held my hand? 

131
00:11:49,367 --> 00:11:51,433
 Hold it tightly, Shin. 

132
00:11:51,433 --> 00:11:55,133
 Doing this won't change anything. 

133
00:11:55,133 --> 00:11:58,400
 At least when I die, 

134
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:01,867
 I can breathe easily. 

135
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:10,100
 No, please. 

136
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:13,400
 Let go! Let go! 

137
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,000
 Do you want to regret things again like that day? 

138
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,400
 Are you trying to die together this time? 

139
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:19,167
 Let go. I said let go! 

140
00:12:19,167 --> 00:12:21,800
 Just listen to me, please! 

141
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:22,833
 Let go! 

142
00:12:22,833 --> 00:12:26,367
 Shin! Shin. 

143
00:12:28,667 --> 00:12:31,010
 Even if I go back to that day, 

144
00:12:31,867 --> 00:12:33,300
 I would do the same thing. 

145
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:34,600
 Don't do this. Don't do this. 

146
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:39,200
 - Like today… 
 - Don't do this! 

147
00:13:53,633 --> 00:13:57,267
 Please wake up! 

148
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:02,967
 It was my fault. 

149
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:17,633
The police are looking for him, so they will contact us soon.

150
00:14:18,867 --> 00:14:21,700
Looking for him?

151
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:27,000
What kind of delinquent adult runs away from home?

152
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:34,633
Kun,

153
00:14:34,633 --> 00:14:37,033
regardless of everything else,

154
00:14:37,033 --> 00:14:41,767
you need to forgive Shin.

155
00:14:41,767 --> 00:14:48,067
He worked like a mule and didn't get to spend a single penny.

156
00:14:48,067 --> 00:14:50,433
Because of me…

157
00:14:50,433 --> 00:14:53,967
I started a business in secret from your mom

158
00:14:53,967 --> 00:14:56,867
and ended up completely failing,

159
00:14:56,867 --> 00:15:01,233
but he covered all the losses by going to local events.

160
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:04,300
He worked really hard.

161
00:15:07,167 --> 00:15:09,333
He might look

162
00:15:09,333 --> 00:15:14,467
all shiny on the outside, but inside, he's probably completely rotten.

163
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:42,067
   

164
00:15:42,067 --> 00:15:47,833
I know well, but I'm still worried.

165
00:15:47,833 --> 00:15:49,967
What?

166
00:15:50,633 --> 00:15:53,967
No, it's just that I'm worried.

167
00:15:53,967 --> 00:15:56,167
Wait, just a moment.

168
00:15:56,167 --> 00:15:59,367
He said he's okay.

169
00:15:59,367 --> 00:16:03,700
How many times will you nag? If you're that worried, do it yourself.

170
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:06,567
It's because I'm worried the bad memories might come back.

171
00:16:06,567 --> 00:16:08,733
Did he happen to say he has headaches or anything?

172
00:16:08,733 --> 00:16:09,767
Headache?

173
00:16:09,767 --> 00:16:12,267
   

174
00:16:12,267 --> 00:16:14,800
Just a moment.

175
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:18,500
So, you don't have a headache. Right?

176
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:20,533
No, I don't.

177
00:16:20,533 --> 00:16:23,633
I am currently taking care of my dog.

178
00:16:23,633 --> 00:16:26,033
If there's nothing else, I'll hang up.

179
00:16:26,033 --> 00:16:28,200
Ah, wait a minute!

180
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:31,267
Kyeong Ju Yeon, you don't have any more questions. Right?

181
00:16:31,267 --> 00:16:33,267
What about afterimages? Or any other unusual reactions…

182
00:16:33,267 --> 00:16:37,067
His wrist is okay. Right?

183
00:16:37,067 --> 00:16:39,800
Just a moment.

184
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:43,167
So, you don't have any afterimages or other pains. Right?

185
00:16:43,167 --> 00:16:45,000
Cola, are you constipated?

186
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,900
Hey, try sitting down. Sit down and correct your posture.

187
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:50,300
 Oh, I wasn't talking to you. 

188
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:53,000
Everything is okay.

189
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,533
I've been a bit busy with Shin's stuff lately.

190
00:16:55,533 --> 00:16:57,400
I'll call you back later.

191
00:16:57,400 --> 00:17:00,100
 Okay, then. 

192
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:04,767
He said he's okay, Kyeong Ju Yeon!

193
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:06,667
Why do you keep bothering me?

194
00:17:06,667 --> 00:17:07,667
Pardon?

195
00:17:07,667 --> 00:17:10,367
Ah, I got confused.

196
00:17:10,367 --> 00:17:13,233
I'll hang up now.

197
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,267
- Bye. 
 - Bye.

198
00:17:21,267 --> 00:17:23,067
Bye.

199
00:17:23,067 --> 00:17:25,200
Bye.

200
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:29,367
Still, everything gets through.

201
00:17:29,367 --> 00:17:31,860
Heart to heart,

202
00:17:32,733 --> 00:17:36,900
and gaze to gaze.

203
00:17:41,267 --> 00:17:42,400
Yes, hello.

204
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:46,633
I'm Jeon Sae Yan, who lived at

205
00:17:46,633 --> 00:17:48,633
126 Duri-myeo-gol 15 years ago.

206
00:17:48,633 --> 00:17:52,833
Yes, I was wondering if by any chance you remember me.

207
00:17:52,833 --> 00:17:55,433
Hello? Hello…

208
00:18:01,667 --> 00:18:04,033
Are you almost done with the calls?

209
00:18:04,033 --> 00:18:05,567
I'm not sure.

210
00:18:05,567 --> 00:18:08,067
If you're almost done,

211
00:18:08,067 --> 00:18:11,767
how about going to see Mr. Lee?

212
00:18:11,767 --> 00:18:13,900
Mr. Lee?

213
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:17,767
He must be busy dealing with Lee Shin's affairs.

214
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:22,500
But why do you keep suggesting I go see him?

215
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:23,467
What?

216
00:18:23,467 --> 00:18:27,833
And even the nursing.

217
00:18:27,833 --> 00:18:29,133
Did you two fight?

218
00:18:29,133 --> 00:18:31,267
No, it's not like that.

219
00:18:31,267 --> 00:18:34,167
I just heard that you two became close friends last time,

220
00:18:34,167 --> 00:18:37,367
so I thought you could be a support to each other.

221
00:18:37,367 --> 00:18:40,533
No, surely you'd be more of a support than me.

222
00:18:40,533 --> 00:18:43,267
You are his first love.

223
00:18:47,667 --> 00:18:51,567
Okay, next up is Ms. Ahn Jeong Sook.

224
00:18:51,567 --> 00:18:55,033
Do you want me to help you find your dad?

225
00:18:55,033 --> 00:18:56,400
Really?

226
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,967
Yes.

227
00:18:57,967 --> 00:19:00,167
- Are you asking if it's voice phishing? 
 - Ah, you don't know?

228
00:19:00,167 --> 00:19:01,833
- No, no. 
 - Yes, I see, thank you.

229
00:19:01,833 --> 00:19:03,200
Why is he swearing?

230
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,233
Why is he swearing like that?

231
00:19:05,233 --> 00:19:06,900
Yes.

232
00:19:09,467 --> 00:19:14,133
I'm looking for someone, so I'm calling you now.

233
00:19:14,133 --> 00:19:17,467
Ah, yes. It's 126.

234
00:19:17,467 --> 00:19:21,567
Her mother's name is Jeon So Jeong.

235
00:19:21,567 --> 00:19:23,367
That's right.

236
00:19:23,367 --> 00:19:25,700
Oh, just a moment.

237
00:19:26,633 --> 00:19:27,667
Yes, please go ahead.

238
00:19:27,667 --> 00:19:31,533
 Are you talking about that child's mother? The one who lives with the child alone 

239
00:19:31,533 --> 00:19:33,567
 while the child's father works abroad? 

240
00:19:33,567 --> 00:19:34,800
Uh, yes. That's right.

241
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:37,900
I'm Sae Yan, the child you're talking about.

242
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:40,400
Do you know anything about my father, by any chance?

243
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,500
Even just a name?

244
00:19:43,533 --> 00:19:45,433
 Well… 

245
00:19:45,433 --> 00:19:47,667
 That is… 

246
00:19:47,667 --> 00:19:50,533
 Ugh, I don't know. I don't want to get involved, so don't call me. 

247
00:19:50,533 --> 00:19:53,600
Wait a moment, ma'am.

248
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:56,500
It seemed like she knew something.

249
00:19:56,500 --> 00:20:00,667
 The phone is powered off, connecting to voicemail… 

250
00:20:00,667 --> 00:20:03,433
It said the power is off.

251
00:20:11,067 --> 00:20:13,500
For the first time, someone who knows something has come forward.

252
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:16,833
Am I going to end up not finding my dad?

253
00:20:16,833 --> 00:20:20,867
I've asked other people to call me, if they remember anything,

254
00:20:20,867 --> 00:20:23,133
so let's wait and see.

255
00:20:23,133 --> 00:20:25,033
Okay.

256
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:33,300
Hello?

257
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:36,210
Yes, I'm Sae Yan. I mean I'm Jeon Sae Yan…

258
00:20:37,233 --> 00:20:40,367
You know my father?

259
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:48,033
This one? Or this one?

260
00:20:48,033 --> 00:20:49,467
Which one looks a bit neater?

261
00:20:49,467 --> 00:20:52,333
Clothes that adults might like.

262
00:20:53,833 --> 00:20:58,067
This one is too revealing.

263
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:00,900
Why is my hair this yellow?

264
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:02,400
Should I dye my hair black?

265
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,167
What if my dad thinks I'm a delinquent?

266
00:21:06,033 --> 00:21:07,733
Or can't you lend me your clothes?

267
00:21:07,733 --> 00:21:10,567
Your clothes are tidy. Right?

268
00:21:10,567 --> 00:21:11,700
All right.

269
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:13,233
Oh, it's done. Thank you.

270
00:21:13,233 --> 00:21:15,033
Then just a moment.

271
00:21:15,033 --> 00:21:16,433
Ah, then I should pack a lunchbox.

272
00:21:16,433 --> 00:21:18,867
No, rather than a lunchbox,

273
00:21:18,867 --> 00:21:20,467
yes, I'll find the gift…

274
00:21:20,467 --> 00:21:24,167
I'll find the gift I brought from Italy to give to my dad.

275
00:21:26,033 --> 00:21:27,633
Okay.

276
00:21:27,633 --> 00:21:30,233
Exhale. That's right.

277
00:21:30,233 --> 00:21:31,900
What should I do?

278
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:34,633
I'm too nervous.

279
00:21:34,633 --> 00:21:37,167
What if my dad is disappointed when he sees me?

280
00:21:37,167 --> 00:21:39,433
What if he says I'm not pretty?

281
00:21:39,433 --> 00:21:44,300
You look so pretty to me, so how much prettier must you be to your father?

282
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:49,400
Actually, I…

283
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:52,333
I feel so good.

284
00:21:52,333 --> 00:21:53,967
No, I mean…

285
00:21:53,967 --> 00:21:55,467
I don't know how to ride a bike.

286
00:21:55,467 --> 00:22:00,200
Because kids are all taught by their own fathers to ride a bike like this.

287
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:04,200
So I thought "I should learn when my dad comes," so I didn't learn it.

288
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:06,333
Swimming too! Swimming…

289
00:22:06,333 --> 00:22:10,833
I went to learn swimming, and everyone was being held by their fathers.

290
00:22:10,833 --> 00:22:13,133
Just like this, floating along.

291
00:22:13,133 --> 00:22:16,367
So I just skipped it and didn't go.

292
00:22:16,367 --> 00:22:18,733
I still don't know how to swim.

293
00:22:18,733 --> 00:22:21,367
I'm planning to learn it when my dad comes.

294
00:22:21,367 --> 00:22:23,300
However,

295
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:27,800
I'm finally meeting my dad now.

296
00:22:30,833 --> 00:22:34,233
If you cry now, your eyes will swell up.

297
00:22:34,233 --> 00:22:35,467
You are right.

298
00:22:35,467 --> 00:22:39,133
What if you meet your dad, and he says, "You don't have my eyes."

299
00:22:39,133 --> 00:22:41,700
No way.

300
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:43,730
I won't cry. Look.

301
00:22:44,367 --> 00:22:46,367
I won't cry.

302
00:22:50,067 --> 00:22:51,400
Buy him something delicious.

303
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:53,067
I know all your credit cards have been blocked.

304
00:22:53,067 --> 00:22:57,800
Ah, right. My dad might not have money.

305
00:22:59,833 --> 00:23:03,933
Ju Yeon, you are the best.

306
00:23:32,933 --> 00:23:34,667
Excuse me…

307
00:23:34,667 --> 00:23:35,800
- Yes? 
 - This…

308
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:38,367
Would you sell that to me?

309
00:23:38,367 --> 00:23:41,100
How much is this?

310
00:23:44,233 --> 00:23:46,167
How much can I buy this for?

311
00:23:46,167 --> 00:23:48,467
Hey, let's try it on. Hand it over.

312
00:23:48,467 --> 00:23:49,800
Ah, give it here.

313
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:51,567
I'll just try it on once.

314
00:23:51,567 --> 00:23:54,967
Quickly, quickly. Just once, hurry!

315
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,833
- Just once. 
 - Take it off!

316
00:23:57,833 --> 00:24:01,300
Hey, you delinquent youths.

317
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:04,067
Don't go around hungry, and leave.

318
00:24:04,067 --> 00:24:06,400
- Hey, aren't you standing there? 
 - No.

319
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,800
Ah, jeez, the padded jacket.

320
00:24:09,333 --> 00:24:10,933
You're just giving it away, right?

321
00:24:10,933 --> 00:24:13,800
Your parents might worry if they know you're going around like this…

322
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:18,367
What are you talking about? I'm just stealing back the padding that was stolen from me.

323
00:24:18,367 --> 00:24:20,633
Oh my.

324
00:24:20,633 --> 00:24:24,000
Hey, this is ten times more expensive.

325
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,567
From now on, don't extort anyone and don't get extorted yourself. Okay?

326
00:24:27,567 --> 00:24:29,833
Wow, it's nice.

327
00:24:29,833 --> 00:24:31,167
You're not reporting this to the police. Right?

328
00:24:31,167 --> 00:24:33,767
Promise not to report to the police!

329
00:24:33,767 --> 00:24:35,333
Hold on.

330
00:24:35,333 --> 00:24:38,700
Take off your sunglasses for a moment.

331
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:40,133
Where have I seen that face before?

332
00:24:40,133 --> 00:24:43,067
Don't you extort money from now on, got it?

333
00:24:53,233 --> 00:24:56,400
- Wow, it's… 
 - What's this?

334
00:24:58,367 --> 00:25:01,333
Okay, okay.

335
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:06,433
I've been in sports for 20 years.

336
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,833
How dare…

337
00:25:08,833 --> 00:25:11,233
Those bastards.

338
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:22,033
   

339
00:25:25,967 --> 00:25:27,233
Honey, is this the place?

340
00:25:27,233 --> 00:25:29,467
No, I don't know.

341
00:25:30,367 --> 00:25:33,367
Hey, isn't this outfit more eye-catching?

342
00:25:33,367 --> 00:25:37,400
Wouldn't just gym clothes be better?

343
00:25:39,233 --> 00:25:41,533
How could he even be under police investigation?

344
00:25:41,533 --> 00:25:44,933
Is it okay for the discipline of the Tennis Association to collapse like this?

345
00:25:44,933 --> 00:25:46,467
I didn't hand over the evidence video to the police

346
00:25:46,467 --> 00:25:49,067
because I thought we could find Lee Shin quickly

347
00:25:49,067 --> 00:25:51,300
once the police investigation started.

348
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:53,633
If he returns, he will be cleared of all charges immediately.

349
00:25:53,633 --> 00:25:56,367
It's not just a matter of shedding suspicion.

350
00:25:56,367 --> 00:26:00,167
The person involved has to come and explain, not just disappear.

351
00:26:00,167 --> 00:26:04,133
His long absence from the Athletes' Village has damaged his dignity as a sportsman.

352
00:26:04,133 --> 00:26:05,900
We must strip him of his national team membership right way,

353
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:07,833
and prevent him from participating in competitions.

354
00:26:07,833 --> 00:26:10,100
Anyway,

355
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:12,800
if Player Lee Shin does not appear within two days,

356
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:14,700
I will consider not only a suspension

357
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:18,000
but also permanent expulsion.

358
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,767
Even so, a permanent ban is…

359
00:26:21,767 --> 00:26:24,000
 I'll… 

360
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,300
 I'll bring him along. 

361
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:31,367
It's like splashing water on a dry face.

362
00:26:51,267 --> 00:26:52,933
Hello.

363
00:26:52,933 --> 00:26:54,867
Oh.

364
00:26:54,867 --> 00:26:56,567
Ms. Sae Yan?

365
00:26:56,567 --> 00:26:58,300
Yes.

366
00:26:59,567 --> 00:27:02,667
Dad… Daddy?

367
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:09,540
Can I hug you just once?

368
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:12,270
Oh, sure.

369
00:27:16,333 --> 00:27:20,667
I really tried not to cry.

370
00:27:20,667 --> 00:27:24,067
I truly promised myself I wouldn't cry.

371
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:33,167
The reason I came out today is…

372
00:27:34,067 --> 00:27:36,767
I wanted to tell you today is the last day.

373
00:27:36,767 --> 00:27:39,567
I came out to say that.

374
00:27:41,133 --> 00:27:43,033
I'm sorry.

375
00:27:52,367 --> 00:27:56,933
I'm not usually someone who cries this much.

376
00:27:56,933 --> 00:28:00,767
I actually smile a lot, but you might misunderstand and think I don't smile much.

377
00:28:01,833 --> 00:28:04,000
Ah, that…

378
00:28:08,433 --> 00:28:11,933
I think I drew over a hundred pictures when I was young.

379
00:28:11,933 --> 00:28:15,467
And I brought the best one I drew among them.

380
00:28:15,467 --> 00:28:19,333
Since I didn't know what you looked like, I drew it from my imagination and

381
00:28:19,333 --> 00:28:22,633
it doesn't seem to resemble you much.

382
00:28:28,567 --> 00:28:30,900
For me, just…

383
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:35,967
seeing you this healthy is enough for me.

384
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:41,633
Instead,

385
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:46,100
just please don't forget me.

386
00:28:52,467 --> 00:28:54,967
This is really something I shouldn't be doing.

387
00:28:54,967 --> 00:28:57,133
Pardon?

388
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:00,800
I'm sorry.

389
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:03,033
I came out here for money.

390
00:29:03,033 --> 00:29:05,970
But you looked so pitiable…

391
00:29:06,867 --> 00:29:10,300
What are you talking about…

392
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:14,867
Someone sent me out here.

393
00:29:14,867 --> 00:29:18,700
The truth is, I'm not your real father.

394
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:28,067
What do you mean? He's not her real father?

395
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:34,300
How could you do this to her? She's been yearning for her dad all her life.

396
00:29:35,567 --> 00:29:39,050
The reason I called you in such a hurry is…

397
00:29:39,567 --> 00:29:43,067
Please persuade our Sae Yan to go back to Italy quickly.

398
00:29:43,067 --> 00:29:47,100
I've already submitted her resignation to the tennis association through a lawyer.

399
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:49,933
You made her quit her job as well?

400
00:29:49,933 --> 00:29:52,700
What's the reason for doing this?

401
00:29:56,467 --> 00:30:01,067
I heard you are doing research on bad memories.

402
00:30:05,833 --> 00:30:11,600
Is there really a need to dig up even the bad memories?

403
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:14,333
Why would Sae Yan looking for her dad be considered a bad memory?

404
00:30:14,333 --> 00:30:17,567
Sae Yan has no memories of her dad whatsoever.

405
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:22,110
I'm talking about the bad memories for everyone.

406
00:30:22,833 --> 00:30:24,433
Pardon?

407
00:30:28,967 --> 00:30:30,333
How could you do that?

408
00:30:30,333 --> 00:30:34,733
How could you make me into a daughter who can't even recognize her father's face?

409
00:30:36,167 --> 00:30:38,133
What have I…

410
00:30:44,633 --> 00:30:47,770
And you even submitted a resignation to the association.

411
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:50,433
I am not going back to Italy.

412
00:30:50,433 --> 00:30:52,667
You might think my dad is trash,

413
00:30:52,667 --> 00:30:54,400
but to me, he's my father.

414
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:57,933
He's the father who brought me into this world, please.

415
00:31:07,367 --> 00:31:11,100
Can't you just please leave me alone?

416
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:13,800
You might still think of me as a child,

417
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:16,833
but I'm grown up now.

418
00:31:16,833 --> 00:31:20,500
It can't go on like this. Pack your things right now.

419
00:31:28,433 --> 00:31:30,033
Don't do this.

420
00:31:30,033 --> 00:31:32,233
Let go!

421
00:31:39,167 --> 00:31:41,333
I will take care of Sae Yan.

422
00:31:41,333 --> 00:31:43,067
No matter if it's between parent and child,

423
00:31:43,067 --> 00:31:47,033
how can you deceive even the feelings she's longed for all her life?

424
00:32:39,933 --> 00:32:43,033
I'm so lonely.

425
00:32:43,033 --> 00:32:46,467
Why is there no one by my side?

426
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:52,133
If it's fine with you,

427
00:32:52,133 --> 00:32:55,633
I will be by your side.

428
00:32:55,633 --> 00:32:58,633
Like a devotee to Sae Yan.

429
00:33:06,633 --> 00:33:11,367
I've been crying all day like a fool.

430
00:33:28,567 --> 00:33:32,067
Look at that person. What is he doing?

431
00:33:32,067 --> 00:33:35,200
Oh, that's so funny.

432
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:37,500
Ah, it's cold.

433
00:34:06,667 --> 00:34:08,600
Hello.

434
00:34:10,733 --> 00:34:12,333
Hello?

435
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:20,233
Player Lee Shin?

436
00:34:20,233 --> 00:34:22,067
 Ju Yeon. 

437
00:34:22,067 --> 00:34:24,433
You're disappointed in me, aren't you?

438
00:34:25,967 --> 00:34:27,933
I'm not disappointed.

439
00:34:27,933 --> 00:34:30,467
Where are you? I was worried.

440
00:34:30,467 --> 00:34:32,533
Were you worried about me?

441
00:34:32,533 --> 00:34:33,833
 Tell me where you are. 

442
00:34:33,833 --> 00:34:34,933
Where are you now?

443
00:34:34,933 --> 00:34:36,767
 No, no. It's embarrassing. 

444
00:34:36,767 --> 00:34:41,767
I just called because I wanted to hear your voice. Just hang up, I'm sorry.

445
00:34:41,767 --> 00:34:45,067
Hello? Hello?

446
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:02,400
Did he call from a public phone booth?

447
00:35:04,967 --> 00:35:08,000
   

448
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,067
   

449
00:35:15,933 --> 00:35:18,367
   

450
00:35:18,367 --> 00:35:20,667
Taean?

451
00:35:25,733 --> 00:35:28,367
Hey, how much money is left?

452
00:35:36,333 --> 00:35:38,167
Oh my.

453
00:35:38,167 --> 00:35:40,100
Why?

454
00:35:44,467 --> 00:35:45,467
Lee Shin?

455
00:35:45,467 --> 00:35:47,733
Isn't that the person they said was missing?

456
00:35:47,733 --> 00:35:49,967
Let's post it on social media.

457
00:35:56,320 --> 00:36:01,288
   

458
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:07,367
What's wrong? What happened?

459
00:36:07,367 --> 00:36:09,533
There's a sighting tale about Shin on social media.

460
00:36:09,533 --> 00:36:12,000
It says he's in Taean, so I'll go find him and bring him back.

461
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,533
Taean?

462
00:36:13,533 --> 00:36:16,733
Yeah, go and make sure to bring him back.

463
00:36:16,733 --> 00:36:18,667
Tell him Dad is anxiously waiting.

464
00:36:18,667 --> 00:36:23,100
Why go and pick up someone who ran away and hasn't contacted their parents even once?

465
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:25,800
Leave him be. If he's hungry, he'll come back.

466
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:28,167
Is it all over just because he hides when it gets tough?

467
00:36:28,167 --> 00:36:29,833
Oh, is that so?

468
00:36:29,833 --> 00:36:34,667
Well, now that we know he's safe. Let's wait a bit.

469
00:36:35,833 --> 00:36:38,867
Why are you waiting for him?

470
00:36:38,867 --> 00:36:41,200
Yeah, why would I wait for him?

471
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:42,667
He'll come back on his own.

472
00:36:42,667 --> 00:36:43,700
Just do your job.

473
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:45,500
- Honey! 
 - Oh, you startled me.

474
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:48,333
Ugh, this is so frustrating.

475
00:36:48,967 --> 00:36:53,333
Kun, make sure to drive safely.

476
00:36:53,333 --> 00:36:56,000
What am I supposed to do?

477
00:37:39,533 --> 00:37:41,800
It's right here.

478
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:45,133
It means he's around here.

479
00:38:00,967 --> 00:38:03,200
Why is it not working?

480
00:38:09,267 --> 00:38:11,267
Thank you.

481
00:38:14,367 --> 00:38:16,533
Ju Yeon.

482
00:38:17,933 --> 00:38:21,633
Oh my.

483
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:33,067
Give it here.

484
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,400
I'm thinking of staying here and living like a hermit.

485
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:46,067
Time doesn't seem to pass,

486
00:38:46,067 --> 00:38:48,367
but I feel relieved.

487
00:38:48,367 --> 00:38:51,133
Are you really feeling relieved?

488
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:55,500
Oh, I don't know.

489
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:58,033
If you don't go back, then I just won't go back, either.

490
00:38:58,033 --> 00:38:59,333
Let's live like hermits together.

491
00:38:59,333 --> 00:39:01,600
Huh? I mean…

492
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:04,633
Being a hermit isn't for just anyone, you know?

493
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:11,200
Is this it?

494
00:39:12,067 --> 00:39:14,100
Oh, it startled me.

495
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,133
You said being a hermit isn't for just anyone.

496
00:39:17,133 --> 00:39:20,467
Isn't it totally unsuitable for you?

497
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:32,384
Why are you brothers so fearful of so many things?

498
00:39:32,384 --> 00:39:33,933
Brothers?

499
00:39:33,933 --> 00:39:35,933
Then, well.

500
00:39:35,933 --> 00:39:38,000
What does my brother fear?

501
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,967
Mice, mice.

502
00:39:39,967 --> 00:39:42,200
He freaked out after seeing a mouse in the country house.

503
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:46,733
And after being startled, he ran out so fast that the door came off its hinges.

504
00:39:46,733 --> 00:39:48,033
Jeez.

505
00:39:56,200 --> 00:40:00,933
Your brother is currently handling your affairs.

506
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:05,167
It must be tough for him, too.

507
00:40:06,833 --> 00:40:09,200
So that's why you came.

508
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:12,200
Trying to ease my brother's worries.

509
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:22,700
Thanks to my brother,

510
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:26,733
I've had experiences like this with you.

511
00:40:42,833 --> 00:40:47,200
   

512
00:40:51,667 --> 00:40:54,000
Follow me.

513
00:40:59,567 --> 00:41:04,000
Why aren't you talking?

514
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:07,433
What need is there for words when fishing?

515
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:12,367
You might want to ask

516
00:41:12,367 --> 00:41:16,833
the Han River incident and the emotion diary.

517
00:41:16,833 --> 00:41:19,233
All of it.

518
00:41:20,533 --> 00:41:22,967
Talk to me when you're ready.

519
00:41:22,967 --> 00:41:25,200
Slowly.

520
00:41:37,367 --> 00:41:40,300
Since I was twelve years old,

521
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:46,300
I started harming myself.

522
00:41:48,133 --> 00:41:51,133
When I was crushed by the pressure,

523
00:41:51,133 --> 00:41:53,367
I felt anxious.

524
00:41:55,967 --> 00:41:58,833
My brother saw that.

525
00:41:58,833 --> 00:42:04,500
He said he wasn't interested in whatever I did, but…

526
00:42:05,367 --> 00:42:09,467
Every time my brother went to see Professor Han for counseling,

527
00:42:09,467 --> 00:42:12,200
I felt like he was always talking about me.

528
00:42:13,333 --> 00:42:17,033
Since then, I've been receiving mental coaching from Professor Han.

529
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:22,467
Because patient information must not be leaked.

530
00:42:24,667 --> 00:42:27,967
But who would know there would be such a thing as an emotion diary?

531
00:42:27,967 --> 00:42:32,433
You burned the emotion diary fearing something might be written on it.

532
00:42:33,667 --> 00:42:37,667
Then that night, at the Han River…

533
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:43,633
The one who attempted suicide...

534
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,133
wasn't my brother.

535
00:42:48,733 --> 00:42:50,733
It was me.

536
00:42:52,233 --> 00:42:54,380
My brother said...

537
00:42:55,133 --> 00:42:57,620
to stop imitating him...

538
00:42:58,333 --> 00:43:01,033
and to live as I wish.

539
00:43:02,933 --> 00:43:05,840
But truly, chillingly,

540
00:43:07,833 --> 00:43:11,780
I hadn't even thought about what to do.

541
00:43:12,533 --> 00:43:15,420
So, with the desire to give up everything,

542
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:18,733
I tried to jump into the Han River water,

543
00:43:20,867 --> 00:43:22,267
but he held me back.

544
00:43:22,267 --> 00:43:24,833
 Lee Shin. 

545
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:28,833
With the hand injured from saving me.

546
00:43:30,167 --> 00:43:32,367
Because of that injured hand,

547
00:43:32,367 --> 00:43:36,367
he lived his whole life in his brother's shadow…

548
00:43:36,367 --> 00:43:39,333
But he chose me over himself again.

549
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:43,900
Like a fool.

550
00:43:54,667 --> 00:43:56,767
He's over there.

551
00:43:56,767 --> 00:43:58,400
Also,

552
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:01,100
I spent a little money.

553
00:44:02,833 --> 00:44:06,233
It was also given by Player Lee Shin.

554
00:44:06,233 --> 00:44:07,533
Please tell him I said thank you.

555
00:44:07,533 --> 00:44:10,200
Yes, goodbye.

556
00:44:14,567 --> 00:44:16,780
So on this occasion,

557
00:44:17,700 --> 00:44:20,540
I plan to sort my thoughts out before going back.

558
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:23,900
What I want to do.

559
00:44:23,900 --> 00:44:26,770
What I need to start doing right away.

560
00:44:27,767 --> 00:44:30,850
Because I've lived listening only to what others tell me.

561
00:44:31,567 --> 00:44:34,170
It's my first time making life plans,

562
00:44:35,433 --> 00:44:37,260
so it's difficult.

563
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:44,100
If it's hard to make big plans, start with small ones.

564
00:44:44,100 --> 00:44:48,900
"What should I eat this morning?" "Should I try something I've never eaten?"

565
00:44:48,900 --> 00:44:53,733
Plan and achieve things as they come to mind, one by one.

566
00:44:53,733 --> 00:44:57,600
Next, a bigger plan, and then an even bigger one.

567
00:44:57,600 --> 00:45:00,033
Just like that.

568
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:06,467
Do you know the reason?

569
00:45:06,467 --> 00:45:09,867
The reason I got into someone named Kyeong Ju Yeon.

570
00:45:11,300 --> 00:45:14,633
When I'm with you, I become myself.

571
00:45:14,633 --> 00:45:17,700
I become my true self, not just someone...

572
00:45:19,100 --> 00:45:22,100
wearing my brother's mask.

573
00:45:22,100 --> 00:45:24,667
Every day, according to a fixed schedule,

574
00:45:24,667 --> 00:45:29,100
I lived suppressing my imperfect emotions.

575
00:45:29,100 --> 00:45:31,700
But when I'm with you,

576
00:45:32,900 --> 00:45:36,090
the real me pops out unexpectedly.

577
00:45:36,767 --> 00:45:38,720
As if...

578
00:45:39,933 --> 00:45:43,000
you're making the dead me breathe again.

579
00:45:45,633 --> 00:45:47,900
That's why I like you.

580
00:45:47,900 --> 00:45:49,600
I feel comfortable with you.

581
00:45:51,233 --> 00:45:53,100
Do you know…

582
00:45:54,367 --> 00:45:57,133
Do you know that you hold my happiness?

583
00:46:05,667 --> 00:46:08,267
Shall we take a walk?

584
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:23,333
Ju Yeon.

585
00:46:25,100 --> 00:46:27,667
Mr. Lee.

586
00:46:27,667 --> 00:46:29,967
Mr. Lee Kun.

587
00:46:31,433 --> 00:46:33,333
Mr. Lee Kun.

588
00:46:35,533 --> 00:46:37,580
Are you just leaving?

589
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:42,433
How can you leave just like that, after carrying all that baggage alone up to here?

590
00:46:42,433 --> 00:46:44,433
If you leave like that,

591
00:46:44,433 --> 00:46:46,433
you'll be constantly worried and anxious.

592
00:46:46,433 --> 00:46:49,710
What does that have to do with you?

593
00:46:50,367 --> 00:46:52,800
If you're misunderstanding something…

594
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:54,367
Misunderstanding?

595
00:46:54,367 --> 00:46:56,430
What misunderstanding?

596
00:46:57,600 --> 00:47:00,780
That there's something going on between Lee Shin and you?

597
00:47:01,633 --> 00:47:05,267
I've seen it in the Athletes' Village and now, too.

598
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:10,200
Isn't it foolish to think that is a misunderstanding?

599
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:12,467
It is a misunderstanding.

600
00:47:13,633 --> 00:47:16,767
I'm not sure if it's right to clarify.

601
00:47:16,767 --> 00:47:20,033
Even if you just leave, I don't want to see you leaving with wounds and hurt.

602
00:47:20,033 --> 00:47:21,433
No, that shouldn't be.

603
00:47:21,433 --> 00:47:25,500
Hurt? What hurt?

604
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:30,900
Are you worried that I got hurt because I like you?

605
00:47:30,900 --> 00:47:32,367
There's no such a thing…

606
00:47:32,367 --> 00:47:37,533
You know, it was just an oldmemory game from the start.

607
00:47:37,533 --> 00:47:40,800
I thought about giving it a try as it was my first love.

608
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:43,600
But it turned out to be less impressive than I thought.

609
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:46,900
Just in time, I've started to get tired of a woman like you.

610
00:47:46,900 --> 00:47:49,667
I really dislike complicated things.

611
00:47:49,667 --> 00:47:51,833
Let's not

612
00:47:51,833 --> 00:47:54,567
cling to each other.

613
00:47:54,567 --> 00:47:56,367
Let's be cool about it.

614
00:47:58,767 --> 00:48:00,700
That's a lie.

615
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:06,100
If you say things you don't mean and go,

616
00:48:06,100 --> 00:48:08,633
you'll be uncomfortable all along.

617
00:48:08,633 --> 00:48:13,600
Shall I tell you in a colder, more harsh and cold way so that you can understand?

618
00:48:14,300 --> 00:48:16,333
I said I don't like you.

619
00:48:16,333 --> 00:48:19,533
I'm so sick and tired of you.

620
00:48:24,933 --> 00:48:27,233
Isn't that why...

621
00:48:28,233 --> 00:48:31,133
your father left you, too?

622
00:48:44,133 --> 00:48:46,600
That's enough.

623
00:48:46,600 --> 00:48:49,200
You can do that much.

624
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:53,033
♫  The silent streets are filled  ♫

625
00:48:53,033 --> 00:49:00,400
♫  With countless thoughts and the wounds inside them  ♫

626
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:07,967
♫  You light a small light in a corner  ♫

627
00:49:07,967 --> 00:49:14,700
♫  Of my heart that I had ignored  ♫

628
00:49:14,700 --> 00:49:22,400
♫  Where will it be, that day  ♫

629
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:30,300
♫  How much further do I have to go before I can see  ♫

630
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:36,700
♫  Even if that unreachable dream  ♫

631
00:49:36,700 --> 00:49:44,700
♫  Turns away from me and becomes more blurred  ♫

632
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:53,133
♫  I will walk towards that day  ♫

633
00:49:56,633 --> 00:50:04,200
♫  Stopping at the end of what was a very long day  ♫

634
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:12,200
♫  I let out a long sigh that I've been holding in so long  ♫

635
00:50:12,200 --> 00:50:18,533
♫  When the clouds covering my day clear  ♫

636
00:50:18,533 --> 00:50:26,633
♫  Will I be standing at that day  ♫

637
00:50:27,767 --> 00:50:35,167
♫  I've been waiting for  ♫

638
00:50:44,133 --> 00:50:48,033
   

639
00:50:56,267 --> 00:51:00,333
Patient 109, we will serve you comfortably.

640
00:51:00,333 --> 00:51:01,433
Huh?

641
00:51:01,433 --> 00:51:03,567
Haven't you seen mouse number 109?

642
00:51:03,567 --> 00:51:07,400
How would I know? Do you think I could have stolen it?

643
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:08,700
Wow, that's ridiculous.

644
00:51:08,700 --> 00:51:11,300
There's no way I would do that.

645
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:15,200
Since she reacted so strongly, it really seems like she might have stolen it.

646
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:17,833
Did Professor Han take it?

647
00:51:21,133 --> 00:51:22,967
Then, Dr. Kim,

648
00:51:22,967 --> 00:51:27,400
you're saying that following this paper, we might solve the side effects?

649
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:29,167
 That's right. 

650
00:51:30,533 --> 00:51:34,500
You mean, all memory recognition errors can be restored to their original state?

651
00:51:34,500 --> 00:51:37,433
 The first trial in the U.K. was successful, 

652
00:51:37,433 --> 00:51:40,767
 but let's talk after the second trial. 

653
00:51:40,767 --> 00:51:42,133
Please take good care of it.

654
00:51:42,133 --> 00:51:44,233
If we can just eliminate the side effects,

655
00:51:44,233 --> 00:51:47,200
the subject will live the perfect life he dreams of.

656
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:50,233
Oh, thank you.

657
00:51:54,500 --> 00:51:56,900
Oh, Dr. Nam.

658
00:51:56,900 --> 00:52:01,167
What? Mouse number 109 has disappeared?

659
00:52:05,700 --> 00:52:07,250
  ­ 

660
00:52:17,567 --> 00:52:19,267
You…

661
00:52:19,267 --> 00:52:22,533
What have you done with mouse number 109?

662
00:52:22,533 --> 00:52:24,133
Please cheer up.

663
00:52:24,133 --> 00:52:27,567
I've successfully conducted a reset experiment with mouse number 109.

664
00:52:27,567 --> 00:52:29,700
A reset?

665
00:52:29,700 --> 00:52:34,567
You mean you've reverted mouse number 109 to before the clinical trial?

666
00:52:34,567 --> 00:52:38,433
How dare you tamper with the mouse behind my back without my permission?

667
00:52:38,433 --> 00:52:42,867
Aren't you the one secretly plotting behind the scenes?

668
00:52:42,867 --> 00:52:44,733
For example,

669
00:52:44,733 --> 00:52:46,667
side effects?

670
00:52:50,333 --> 00:52:52,367
How did you know…

671
00:52:52,367 --> 00:52:56,367
I've already secured the evidence from your computer.

672
00:52:56,367 --> 00:53:00,900
Oh, that's just a very minor side effect.

673
00:53:00,900 --> 00:53:02,600
You know that…

674
00:53:02,600 --> 00:53:06,767
It's just a very trivial memory error.

675
00:53:06,767 --> 00:53:11,867
It's just simply mistaking Kyeong Ju Yeon as his first love. That's all.

676
00:53:11,867 --> 00:53:17,867
Ah, first love. That's it.

677
00:53:17,867 --> 00:53:20,633
I was confused for a while because you put a password on the file.

678
00:53:20,633 --> 00:53:25,100
Were you just testing me?

679
00:53:25,100 --> 00:53:27,367
The mouse test must have been successful, too.

680
00:53:27,367 --> 00:53:29,633
Please cooperate with the subject reset experiment.

681
00:53:29,633 --> 00:53:30,767
The patient Lee Kun.

682
00:53:30,767 --> 00:53:32,690
What?

683
00:53:33,333 --> 00:53:34,467
That is absolutely not allowed.

684
00:53:34,467 --> 00:53:36,800
If you don't cooperate, there's nothing I can do.

685
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:40,033
I'll have no choice but to talk to the subject directly.

686
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:44,033
What do you mean that you're going to talk to the subject?

687
00:53:44,033 --> 00:53:46,867
You're going to tell them that he was a clinical trial subject?

688
00:53:46,867 --> 00:53:50,100
Do you have any idea how dangerous that is?

689
00:53:50,100 --> 00:53:55,533
Nobody knows what kind of dangerous stimuli it could give to the subject's brain circuitry.

690
00:53:55,533 --> 00:53:59,933
We are currently researching ways to eliminate the side effects.

691
00:53:59,933 --> 00:54:01,567
Just wait a little bit.

692
00:54:01,567 --> 00:54:04,200
That won't do.

693
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:06,167
If that side effect disappears,

694
00:54:06,167 --> 00:54:09,033
I'll be left with nothing. Right?

695
00:54:09,033 --> 00:54:12,067
Are you trying to fulfil your own desires

696
00:54:12,067 --> 00:54:14,767
with someone's life?

697
00:54:14,767 --> 00:54:20,467
Isn't the reason you hid the side effects to satisfy your greed, Professor Han?

698
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:27,180
 ­  

699
00:54:36,630 --> 00:54:41,940
 ­  

700
00:55:21,567 --> 00:55:23,167
Yes, Professor Han.

701
00:55:23,167 --> 00:55:25,400
Te Oh…

702
00:55:25,400 --> 00:55:27,933
Te Oh found out about the side effects…

703
00:55:27,933 --> 00:55:33,133
 The ones related to Kun recognizing you as his first love. 

704
00:55:33,133 --> 00:55:34,033
What?

705
00:55:34,033 --> 00:55:37,367
 If we don't cooperate with the reset experiment, 

706
00:55:37,367 --> 00:55:42,433
he said he would reveal everything to the subject,

707
00:55:43,100 --> 00:55:45,200
from the clinical trial to the side effects.

708
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:47,667
 What should I do about this? 

709
00:55:47,667 --> 00:55:51,400
Are you saying he'll tell Kun everything about the clinical trial?

710
00:55:57,600 --> 00:56:01,300
Ju Yeon, are you okay?

711
00:56:01,300 --> 00:56:03,767
Your brother is in danger.

712
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:06,490
Ju Yeon.

713
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:09,433
I'm sorry.

714
00:56:09,433 --> 00:56:10,833
I guess…

715
00:56:10,833 --> 00:56:13,433
I guess, I…

716
00:56:13,433 --> 00:56:15,933
I…

717
00:56:15,933 --> 00:56:19,033
I finally understand what I must do.

718
00:56:36,067 --> 00:56:37,733
Get on.

Mr. Lee Kun.

741
00:59:27,567 --> 00:59:29,400
He's not at the agency.

742
00:59:29,400 --> 00:59:31,967
 I'm checking Lee Kun's family home just in case. 

743
00:59:31,967 --> 00:59:34,833
 Te Oh is not answering my calls. I wonder where he went. 

744
00:59:34,833 --> 00:59:36,800
 Could it be that he went to Lee Kun? 

745
00:59:36,800 --> 00:59:38,767
Senior Te Oh?

746
00:59:38,767 --> 00:59:41,100
I'll call you back.

747
00:59:43,733 --> 00:59:46,200
Dr. Yeo, you know where Te Oh is. Right?

748
00:59:46,200 --> 00:59:47,800
I'm not sure.

749
00:59:47,800 --> 00:59:51,033
You know, Dr. Yeo, please tell me.

750
00:59:51,033 --> 00:59:52,467
 As expected… 

751
00:59:52,467 --> 00:59:55,300
You knew all about our relationship.

I'm sorry.

753
00:59:57,767 --> 01:00:00,700
It's all right. Just tell me where he is.

754
01:00:00,700 --> 01:00:02,690
 Actually, 

755
01:00:03,267 --> 01:00:08,433
he went to the lab to gather data about the subject.

756
01:00:08,433 --> 01:00:10,420
Thank you.

757

 A rabbit that resembles you.

 It's perfect. A first date with a first love.

 We have to succeed in the experiment even one day earlier than Te Oh.

 He is a dangerous person who has committed murder.
