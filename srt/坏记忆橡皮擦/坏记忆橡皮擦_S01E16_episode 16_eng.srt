8
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:48,500
 Is it Sae Yan? 

9
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:51,133
 Sae Yan is that girl? 

10
00:00:51,133 --> 00:00:53,633
 Are you okay? 

11
00:00:53,633 --> 00:00:56,033
 Open your eyes. 

12
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:03,967
 Are you okay? 

13
00:01:05,167 --> 00:01:09,467
 Why have all the other memories returned 

14
00:01:09,467 --> 00:01:12,500
 but the memory of the first love is still the same? 

15
00:01:14,733 --> 00:01:17,800
 Why do I remember Kyeong Ju Yeon? 

16
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:56,200
   

17
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,967
   

18
00:01:57,967 --> 00:02:00,767
The ethics committee will now commence.

19
00:02:00,767 --> 00:02:03,433
The subject under review, please state your case.

20
00:02:03,433 --> 00:02:07,433
I am Kyeong Ju Yeon, a psychiatrist at Hanseom Hospital

21
00:02:07,433 --> 00:02:11,133
and affiliated with the brain research center.

22
00:02:11,133 --> 00:02:12,867
As the person in charge of this clinical experiment,

23
00:02:12,867 --> 00:02:16,933
please impose a fitting punishment on me for hiding the side effects,

24
00:02:16,933 --> 00:02:20,633
and I also request the discontinuation of this experiment,

25
00:02:20,633 --> 00:02:25,167
which caused the side effects.

26
00:02:32,033 --> 00:02:33,700
Who are you?

27
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:38,600
I'm Lee Kun, a subject in the clinical trial.

28
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:39,733
Mr. Lee Kun.

29
00:02:39,733 --> 00:02:43,500
You're probably still not in good condition.

30
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:49,033
Please take a seat over there.

31
00:03:02,933 --> 00:03:04,967
Are you okay?

32
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,600
Are you all right?

33
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:12,733
Originally, he was a patient who suffered from somatization disorder caused by bad memories.

34
00:03:12,733 --> 00:03:14,233
It was a phantom pain.

35
00:03:14,233 --> 00:03:17,200
When the bad memory was erased, the pain disappeared,

36
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:20,800
but the pain returned like that due to the reset experiment.

37
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:25,200
This proves that the reset experiment is perfect.

38
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:31,267
Witness, can you continue?

39
00:03:31,267 --> 00:03:34,467
If you're okay with it,

40
00:03:34,467 --> 00:03:36,833
I will step out.

41
00:03:36,833 --> 00:03:42,033
Facing me will be difficult for the subject, as I am associated with his bad memory.

42
00:04:15,267 --> 00:04:19,233
I heard that specific memories were corrupted due to the side effects.

43
00:04:19,233 --> 00:04:20,767
Have they returned now?

44
00:04:20,767 --> 00:04:22,467
No.

45
00:04:23,533 --> 00:04:26,500
That memory is still the same.

46
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,533
Still the same?

47
00:04:28,533 --> 00:04:30,933
How can that be?

48
00:04:30,933 --> 00:04:35,367
Then Dr. Kyeong Ju Yeon erased Mr. Lee Kun's bad memories,

49
00:04:35,367 --> 00:04:38,667
so do you not resent the clinical experiment?

50
00:04:40,267 --> 00:04:42,233
I do not resent it.

51
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,533
Then, I will ask one last question.

52
00:04:45,533 --> 00:04:51,267
Would you recommend this clinical experiment to others?

53
00:04:51,267 --> 00:04:56,067
The question is whether you would erase a bad memory if you could go back to the past.

54
00:05:00,767 --> 00:05:02,667
After the experiment,

55
00:05:04,767 --> 00:05:08,767
I lived as someone else for a while.

56
00:05:10,333 --> 00:05:15,633
I felt like I had gone from someone's sidekick to the main character.

57
00:05:15,633 --> 00:05:19,667
But then I realized that, too, was a part of who I am.

58
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:23,467
While the past cannot be changed,

59
00:05:23,467 --> 00:05:27,550
I learned that I can change myself.

60
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:31,860
If you ask me if I would conduct clinical trials again,

61
00:05:32,567 --> 00:05:36,600
no, I wouldn't.

62
00:05:39,633 --> 00:05:41,600
Because I...

63
00:05:45,867 --> 00:05:49,133
already know how to live differently now.

64
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:22,867
Then I'll inform you of the ethics committee's review results.

65
00:06:22,867 --> 00:06:24,433
Dr. Kyeong Ju Yeon is recommended

66
00:06:24,433 --> 00:06:28,733
to suspend clinical trials for three months.

67
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:34,133
Also, regarding the feasibility of continuing the experiment…

68
00:06:34,133 --> 00:06:36,567
Oh, Minister.

69
00:06:37,633 --> 00:06:39,467
I heard it from Dr. Kyeong.

70
00:06:39,467 --> 00:06:43,110
They said it had totally deviated from the original intention of the experiment.

71
00:06:43,733 --> 00:06:45,133
No, it hasn't changed.

72
00:06:45,133 --> 00:06:47,567
The ethics committee is the one that approves this experiment,

73
00:06:47,567 --> 00:06:50,100
but our institution is the one providing support.

74
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:52,033
Is it true that you concealed the death of a test subject

75
00:06:52,033 --> 00:06:55,300
and proceeded with the clinical trial?

76
00:06:55,867 --> 00:06:58,067
No, that's…

77
00:06:58,067 --> 00:07:00,300
Yes.

78
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:01,567
It is true.

79
00:07:01,567 --> 00:07:04,780
The subject was also unaware of this fact.

80
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,467
Were you aware of this, Director?

81
00:07:07,467 --> 00:07:10,870
I just learned about that fact today as well.

82
00:07:11,567 --> 00:07:13,200
I am ashamed.

83
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,200
We will withdraw our institution's support

84
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:17,267
and reclaim the remaining funds.

85
00:07:17,267 --> 00:07:23,033
Furthermore, someone must take responsibility for this matter.

86
00:07:25,333 --> 00:07:28,333
Oh… Minister... Minister!

87
00:07:28,333 --> 00:07:30,600
Director, do not worry.

88
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:33,400
People will line up to support you.

89
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,700
Committee members,

90
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:40,700
as the director of Hanseom Hospital,

91
00:07:41,733 --> 00:07:45,167
I'll officially initiate disciplinary procedures

92
00:07:45,167 --> 00:07:48,567
against Professor Yoon Te Oh,

93
00:07:48,567 --> 00:07:50,867
who unilaterally carried out unethical experiments.

94
00:07:54,133 --> 00:07:56,033
Director.

95
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:39,960
♫  At the end of every day  ♫

96
00:08:39,967 --> 00:08:43,633
 CEO, seeing you at your desk means you've come to work. Right? 

97
00:08:43,633 --> 00:08:45,367
 Welcome. 

98
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:55,000
♫  Don't lose your light yet  ♫

99
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:02,900
♫  You were warmer than anyone else  ♫

100
00:09:03,933 --> 00:09:10,267
♫  It's okay  ♫

101
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:20,667
♫  Even if you fall into an abyss  ♫

102
00:09:21,767 --> 00:09:28,033
♫  That day will become so bright it dazzles your eyes  ♫

103
00:09:28,033 --> 00:09:36,133
♫  Even if your footsteps are still heavy  ♫

104
00:09:36,133 --> 00:09:40,967
♫  I will be by your side, as if it's fate  ♫

105
00:09:40,967 --> 00:09:44,967
 Even if it's bothersome, eat fancily like you used to. 

106
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:57,267
♫  I will protect you  ♫

107
00:10:11,567 --> 00:10:15,133
Finding my father was my only wish.

108
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:35,467
I think now I know why Mom wouldn't let me find him.

109
00:10:40,267 --> 00:10:42,500
Ju Yeon, I'm sorry.

110
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:46,400
You were my only ally.

111
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:48,867
 Jeon Sae Yan is all alone. 

112
00:10:48,867 --> 00:10:50,600
 - All alone. 
 - All alone. 

113
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:53,533
 Hey, they say she has no friends and no dad. 

114
00:10:53,533 --> 00:10:56,533
 - No dad. 
 - No dad. 

115
00:10:56,533 --> 00:10:59,200
 My dad is making a lot of money abroad, you know? 

116
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,400
 My mom says all that is a lie. 

117
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,300
 They say your dad is a bad person. 

118
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:06,700
 That's why your mom took you and ran away all the way here. 

119
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:08,367
 What are you guys doing? 

120
00:11:08,367 --> 00:11:10,467
 Let's go, Sae Yan. 

121
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:19,467
 - Jeon Sae Yan pooped. 
 - Jeon Sae Yan pooped. 

122
00:11:24,133 --> 00:11:26,300
 Look! I pooped too. 

123
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:29,933
 Do you guys want to taste my poop? 

124
00:11:30,833 --> 00:11:33,733
 - Oh, that's dirty. 
 - Dirty. 

125
00:11:35,233 --> 00:11:37,067
 Are you okay? 

126
00:11:37,067 --> 00:11:39,267
 I brought a gift from Seoul. 

127
00:11:39,267 --> 00:11:41,867
 This is a wish bracelet. I made it. 

128
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:45,467
 When you want to make a wish, wear this bracelet until it breaks 

129
00:11:45,467 --> 00:11:47,000
 and your wish will come true. 

130
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,600
 Really? Any wish? 

131
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:51,433
 Then, shall I put it on you now? 

132
00:11:51,433 --> 00:11:54,600
 No, I'll save it and use it when I get older. 

133
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,767
 Okay. 

134
00:11:55,767 --> 00:11:58,533
 Let's make sure to meet when we're grown up, wearing these wish bracelets. 

135
00:11:58,533 --> 00:12:00,867
 I picked it up on the way. 

136
00:12:00,867 --> 00:12:03,033
 Mamma Mia. 

137
00:12:03,033 --> 00:12:05,800
 I'm totally smitten. 

138
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:07,167
I'm foolish.

139
00:12:07,167 --> 00:12:10,167
I'm really foolish.

140
00:12:19,667 --> 00:12:22,533
I have to protect Ju Yeon.

141
00:12:23,567 --> 00:12:27,267
I must find a way to get out of here.

142
00:12:32,733 --> 00:12:34,500
Yes, Inspector Kim.

143
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:37,500
Ah, I have something I'd like to ask.

144
00:12:38,967 --> 00:12:42,533
She's a grown adult, but I'm wondering if that qualifies for a missing person report.

145
00:12:42,533 --> 00:12:46,633
I heard that she's with her biological father, but there's been no contact.

146
00:12:46,633 --> 00:12:50,333
There is no family register relation.

147
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,867
You suggest I consult with her family first?

148
00:12:56,833 --> 00:12:59,400
Yes, I understand.

149
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:02,233
Oh, by the way, any news on the stalker?

150
00:13:02,233 --> 00:13:04,300
The photos?

151
00:13:05,567 --> 00:13:08,400
Ah, you sent it via my brother's email?

152
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:11,800
Yes, I'll check and get back to you.

153
00:13:23,233 --> 00:13:26,300
   

154
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:29,133
 No, I think I found it. 

155
00:13:29,133 --> 00:13:31,167
 Dad. 

156
00:13:31,167 --> 00:13:34,800
 He's a person with a criminal record of violence, obsession, and stalking. 

157
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,833
 I can't go into details, 

158
00:13:36,833 --> 00:13:40,267
 but he is a dangerous individual who has committed murder. 

159
00:13:40,267 --> 00:13:43,967
 Why would Sae Yan's father try to harm Shin… 

160
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:47,133
He's a stranger after all.

161
00:13:47,133 --> 00:13:50,860
And yet he followed me so persistently.

162
00:13:51,533 --> 00:13:53,833
Why didn't I notice?

163
00:13:56,567 --> 00:13:58,500
Do you know him?

164
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,667
Huh? No.

165
00:14:02,267 --> 00:14:05,867
Didn't you say that Ms. Jeon Sae Yan had returned to Italy?

166
00:14:05,867 --> 00:14:07,667
Jeon Sae Yan?

167
00:14:09,833 --> 00:14:12,410
Are you going to meet your first love?

168
00:14:13,033 --> 00:14:16,567
I heard that she didn't go to Italy but is in Korea.

169
00:14:16,567 --> 00:14:18,200
Strangely, I can't get in touch with her.

170
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,367
What do you mean by that?

171
00:14:19,367 --> 00:14:20,867
What do you mean you can't get in touch with her?

172
00:14:20,867 --> 00:14:23,967
It seems like she found the father she had been searching for and is staying with him.

173
00:14:23,967 --> 00:14:28,800
So you mean she's with her real dad now and can't even be contacted?

174
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:32,600
Yes, apparently her phone has been off for a while?

175
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,200
Even without that,

176
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:40,100
it's a bit awkward to report to the police, so I've decided to look with Ju Yeon.

177
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:42,967
I just stopped by before meeting Ju Yeon.

178
00:15:03,133 --> 00:15:05,167
What's this?

179
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,967
Where's the credit card?

180
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:17,367
 Yes, even if a card is canceled, if I'm reported as missing, the police will find me. 

181
00:15:22,533 --> 00:15:23,867
Ju Yeon's credit card.

182
00:15:23,867 --> 00:15:27,867
 Buy your dad something tasty. I know your credit card's been canceled. 

183
00:16:12,167 --> 00:16:15,467
   

184
00:16:25,533 --> 00:16:28,333
Yes, Player Lee Shin, have you arrived?

185
00:16:28,333 --> 00:16:30,500
I'll be down in a moment.

186
00:17:05,533 --> 00:17:07,833
This credit card…

187
00:17:07,833 --> 00:17:10,433
It's the credit card I gave to Sae Yan.

188
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:16,500
Yes, hello?

189
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:19,433
 Hello, customer, this is ABC Card. 

190
00:17:19,433 --> 00:17:24,067
 There have been consecutive small charges at places where you don't usually use your card. 

191
00:17:24,067 --> 00:17:27,133
 We called to check if the card has been lost. 

192
00:17:27,133 --> 00:17:29,900
 Did you make these transactions? 

193
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:33,133
Ah, it's a credit card I gave to someone else.

194
00:17:33,133 --> 00:17:36,367
It's unlikely that it would be used at an auto service center, though.

195
00:17:36,367 --> 00:17:38,367
Just a moment.

196
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:44,167
Myeongseong Car Center?

197
00:17:45,067 --> 00:17:47,067
112 won.

198
00:17:47,067 --> 00:17:48,433
505 won.

199
00:17:48,433 --> 00:17:51,867
8282 won.

200
00:17:51,867 --> 00:17:55,867
One, one, two. 112.

201
00:17:55,867 --> 00:17:58,900
The report number.

202
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:00,933
505.

203
00:18:00,933 --> 00:18:02,200
SOS.

204
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:05,033
8282, quickly.

205
00:18:05,033 --> 00:18:06,067
Excuse me, just a moment.

206
00:18:06,067 --> 00:18:09,233
Can I get the address of this auto center?

207
00:18:13,067 --> 00:18:17,433
Hello, I'm Lee Shin's elder brother, Lee Kun.

208
00:18:17,433 --> 00:18:21,900
Well… I wanted to hear about the stalker.

209
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:23,933
I visited the registered address.

210
00:18:23,933 --> 00:18:26,567
As expected, it was not the residence.

211
00:18:27,833 --> 00:18:32,067
Could that person possibly harm his family, too?

212
00:18:32,067 --> 00:18:33,400
 You said he's a dangerous person. 

213
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:38,733
Yes, all the previous offenses were due to an obsession with a cohabitating woman.

214
00:18:38,733 --> 00:18:42,933
The Durimoe Valley murder case from 15 years ago was also due to obsession.

215
00:18:42,933 --> 00:18:46,067
The Durimoe Valley murder case?

216
00:18:59,833 --> 00:19:01,467
I think we should start from here.

217
00:19:01,467 --> 00:19:03,567
This is the credit card I gave to Sae Yan.

218
00:19:03,567 --> 00:19:05,867
Take a look at this.

219
00:19:05,867 --> 00:19:08,933
Myeongseong Car Center.

220
00:19:08,933 --> 00:19:10,167
A payment of 112 won?

221
00:19:10,167 --> 00:19:11,567
It feels unsettling.

222
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:14,433
The amount is like an emergency number, and here, SOS, 8282…

223
00:19:14,433 --> 00:19:17,133
I suspect it's a message from Sae Yan.

224
00:19:17,133 --> 00:19:20,330
The car center's address turned out to be here.

225
00:19:20,967 --> 00:19:22,300
   

226
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:23,900
No way.

227
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:26,000
Someone wouldn't be playing a prank with a found card. Right?

228
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,433
Did you call the car center?

229
00:19:27,433 --> 00:19:30,867
They're not answering. Since it was not long ago, let's start by going there.

230
00:19:30,867 --> 00:19:32,533
Get in.

231
00:19:35,233 --> 00:19:37,300
Oh, just a moment.

232
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:39,433
I've received a text from Sae Yan.

233
00:19:39,433 --> 00:19:41,467
 Ju Yeon, it's me. Sae Yan. 

234
00:19:41,467 --> 00:19:43,533
 I'm heading to your clinic now. 

235
00:19:43,533 --> 00:19:45,567
 Can we meet? 

236
00:19:45,567 --> 00:19:47,367
 I can't take calls right now. 

237
00:19:47,367 --> 00:19:48,667
 I have something to tell you. 

238
00:19:48,667 --> 00:19:51,367
Huh? This…

239
00:19:54,167 --> 00:19:55,667
Of course, I knew it.

240
00:19:55,667 --> 00:19:59,160
Ah, that's a relief, I thought…

241
00:19:59,867 --> 00:20:03,067
I'm sorry for the trouble. It seems I worried for nothing.

242
00:20:03,067 --> 00:20:07,433
Still, since the card seems to be lost, let's report it lost first.

243
00:20:07,433 --> 00:20:09,800
Yes, thank you.

244
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:12,033
Then I'll go meet Sae Yan.

245
00:20:12,033 --> 00:20:13,900
You go in first.

246
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:42,433
The Durimoe Valley murder case.

247
00:20:43,967 --> 00:20:46,867
   

248
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:51,333
Stalking crime.

249
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:54,800
   

250
00:20:55,567 --> 00:20:59,033
   

251
00:21:01,333 --> 00:21:04,233
   

252
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:12,300
   

253
00:21:14,233 --> 00:21:17,600
Professor Kyeong Sang Hyun?

254
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:22,067
Then does that mean Sae Yan's father killed Ju Yeon's father?

255
00:21:53,067 --> 00:21:55,933
Is this the right place?

256
00:22:02,667 --> 00:22:04,667
 - Lee Shin?  
 - Hello?

257
00:22:04,667 --> 00:22:06,667
 - Shin.  
 - Why does your voice sound like that?

258
00:22:06,667 --> 00:22:08,233
 Where's Ju Yeon? 

259
00:22:08,233 --> 00:22:10,333
Ju Yeon?

260
00:22:10,333 --> 00:22:12,950
She got a text message from Jeon Sae Yan.

261
00:22:13,533 --> 00:22:18,367
Ju Yeon got a message from her asking to meet at the clinic, so she went up, and I…

262
00:22:18,367 --> 00:22:20,100
Hello?

263
00:22:30,233 --> 00:22:31,900
Oh? Dr. Kyeong?

264
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:34,867
Why are you coming back? Didn't you leave work?

265
00:22:34,867 --> 00:22:36,733
I heard a visitor is coming in a moment.

266
00:22:36,733 --> 00:22:37,833
You go ahead and leave first.

267
00:22:37,833 --> 00:22:39,867
Ah, yes.

268
00:22:39,867 --> 00:22:41,900
Then, see you at the farewell party.

269
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:43,510
Yes.

270
00:22:43,510 --> 00:22:46,840
  ­ 

271
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:54,567
Is it here?

272
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:57,333
Myeongseong Car Center.

273
00:22:57,333 --> 00:22:59,870
Okay.

274
00:22:59,870 --> 00:23:03,060
  ­ 

275
00:23:38,833 --> 00:23:39,900
Excuse me!

276
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:41,967
Huh?

277
00:23:43,167 --> 00:23:47,233
Over here! Over here! There's someone here!

278
00:23:47,233 --> 00:23:51,367
Here! Please save me here!

279
00:23:56,967 --> 00:23:59,433
Over here!

280
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,567
Please save me!

281
00:24:04,967 --> 00:24:08,867
I think I heard a noise.

282
00:24:21,333 --> 00:24:24,733
 I'm at the clinic now. When will you arrive? 

283
00:25:00,833 --> 00:25:04,133
 Ju… Ju Yeon. 

284
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:33,700
There's someone here!

285
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:36,190
Please save me.

286
00:25:44,133 --> 00:25:48,333
Yes, over here! There's someone here!

287
00:25:50,233 --> 00:25:51,767
Jeon Sae Yan! Is that you?

288
00:25:51,767 --> 00:25:55,900
Yes, I am Jeon Sae Yan.

289
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:02,400
Please save me!

290
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:15,167
- Lee Shin? 
 - Hey.

291
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:35,000
   

292
00:26:49,933 --> 00:26:52,233
It's been 15 years.

293
00:27:02,933 --> 00:27:05,833
Do you remember my face?

294
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:25,433
How can you feed and shelter the daughter of the man who killed your own father?

295
00:27:25,433 --> 00:27:28,200
What on earth were you thinking?

296
00:27:30,367 --> 00:27:32,933
Approaching her kindly,

297
00:27:32,933 --> 00:27:37,333
shaking my delicate daughter's heart,

298
00:27:37,333 --> 00:27:40,100
and when she is off guard,

299
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:42,770
"Your father is a murderer."

300
00:27:43,533 --> 00:27:47,200
"I will make you just like your father."

301
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:52,467
Did you think I wouldn't know about your tricks?

302
00:27:53,067 --> 00:27:56,767
That you're trying to distance me from my daughter.

303
00:28:22,367 --> 00:28:26,333
   

304
00:28:45,667 --> 00:28:51,033
This is the only way to be with my daughter forever…

305
00:28:54,133 --> 00:28:55,767
You too.

306
00:28:57,300 --> 00:29:02,733
Stay forever with your father.

307
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:35,700
Ju Yeon.

308
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:46,600
Ju Yeon.

309
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:49,533
Ju Yeon.

310
00:30:08,433 --> 00:30:11,733
Ahn Hyo Myeong, drop the weapon.

311
00:30:11,733 --> 00:30:13,967
Drop the weapon!

312
00:30:18,833 --> 00:30:21,067
Drop the weapon.

313
00:30:30,667 --> 00:30:33,467
Ju Yeon.

314
00:30:33,467 --> 00:30:35,300
Ju Yeon.

315
00:30:37,233 --> 00:30:39,433
Wake up.

316
00:30:39,433 --> 00:30:40,767
Wake up.

317
00:30:40,767 --> 00:30:43,833
Ju Yeon.

318
00:30:43,833 --> 00:30:47,467
Ju Yeon. Wake up, Ju Yeon!

319
00:30:47,467 --> 00:30:49,233
Ju Yeon.

320
00:31:00,933 --> 00:31:02,600
Dad.

321
00:31:04,167 --> 00:31:09,900
Why did you come out? It's safe over there.

322
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:12,367
You're wearing such thin clothes.

323
00:31:12,367 --> 00:31:14,867
What will you do if you catch a cold?

324
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,267
I made the report.

325
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:22,767
Please stop harassing the people around me.

326
00:31:22,767 --> 00:31:28,030
Are those people more important to you than your own family?

327
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:32,133
To me, those people are also my family.

328
00:31:32,133 --> 00:31:35,567
Family? Family?

329
00:31:35,567 --> 00:31:37,533
I am your family.

330
00:31:39,033 --> 00:31:41,667
I am your father!

331
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,500
Sae Yan,

332
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:49,633
Lee Shin made you to do this. Right?

333
00:31:49,633 --> 00:31:52,067
Goodness! I knew my daughter wouldn't do such a thing.

334
00:31:52,067 --> 00:31:54,067
Lee Shin,

335
00:31:54,067 --> 00:31:56,567
you bastard, what have you done to my daughter. Huh?

336
00:31:56,567 --> 00:31:58,167
You bastard, Lee Shin!

337
00:31:58,167 --> 00:32:00,633
- Go now, quickly! 
 - You bastard.

338
00:32:00,633 --> 00:32:03,567
Lee Shin! Stay away from my daughter right now.

339
00:32:03,567 --> 00:32:06,067
Lee Shin!

340
00:32:10,367 --> 00:32:12,600
Are you okay?

341
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:14,667
Ah, that… Ju Yeon.

342
00:32:14,667 --> 00:32:17,833
Is Ju Yeon all right?

343
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:27,233
   

344
00:32:37,067 --> 00:32:38,467
 Sis! 

345
00:32:38,467 --> 00:32:41,300
 - Sae Yan. 
 - Oh dear. 

346
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:45,033
 - I bought this. 
 - Yes. 

347
00:32:45,033 --> 00:32:47,833
 - I'll leave this here. 
 - A gift! 

348
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,233
 I'll be right back. 

349
00:32:56,233 --> 00:32:59,267
 Are you leaving? No, this way. 

350
00:33:01,033 --> 00:33:02,300
 Thank you. 

351
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:05,000
 - Yes, I'll be right back. 
 - Yes. 

352
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:22,633
 - Hello, elders. 
 - Ah, yes. 

353
00:33:22,633 --> 00:33:24,467
 Be sure to stop by the health center this afternoon. 

354
00:33:24,467 --> 00:33:25,533
 - Yes. 
 - Yes. 

355
00:33:25,533 --> 00:33:28,133
 I'll go. Yes. 

356
00:33:42,210 --> 00:33:44,750
 ­  

357
00:33:48,133 --> 00:33:50,833
   

358
00:33:50,833 --> 00:33:53,967
   

359
00:33:53,967 --> 00:33:56,433
 Yes, come in. 

360
00:34:01,567 --> 00:34:03,467
 Have a seat. 

361
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:12,600
   

362
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:14,567
 Oh my, 2,000 won. 

363
00:34:14,567 --> 00:34:16,767
 Right, Sae Yan's mom would be nice. 

364
00:34:16,767 --> 00:34:19,100
 Sae Yan's dad returned from abroad, didn't he? 

365
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:22,067
 I heard you moved here permanently to live with Sae Yan. 

366
00:34:22,067 --> 00:34:23,467
 Do you like living together? 

367
00:34:23,467 --> 00:34:26,667
 Did that person come here? 

368
00:34:26,667 --> 00:34:30,667
 Yes, I even told him your home address. 

369
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:33,800
 Haven't you met him yet? 

370
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:36,833
 For now, take Sae Yan and stay out of sight. 

371
00:34:38,633 --> 00:34:41,433
 Did I make a mistake? 

372
00:34:41,433 --> 00:34:43,600
 I should inform Ju Yeon's father. 

373
00:34:50,170 --> 00:34:53,420
  ­ 

374
00:35:11,333 --> 00:35:14,867
 Ah… Dad. 

375
00:35:14,867 --> 00:35:18,400
 Ju Yeon. Ju Yeon. 

376
00:35:18,967 --> 00:35:20,900
 Ju Yeon. 

377
00:36:06,533 --> 00:36:10,233
 Ju Yeon, no. 

378
00:36:10,233 --> 00:36:12,633
 No. 

379
00:37:02,733 --> 00:37:05,400
Ju Yeon.

380
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:07,333
Are you feeling better?

381
00:37:07,333 --> 00:37:09,133
Mom.

382
00:37:09,133 --> 00:37:11,833
What happened?

383
00:37:11,833 --> 00:37:13,900
Where's Sae Yan?

384
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:15,933
She's safe.

385
00:37:15,933 --> 00:37:18,233
You don't need to worry.

386
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:23,600
Ju Yeon.

387
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:25,633
Ma'am.

388
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:33,433
Ju Yeon.

389
00:37:36,567 --> 00:37:38,900
It may sound funny...

390
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:41,967
to say sorry,

391
00:37:44,033 --> 00:37:46,433
but I'm really sorry.

392
00:37:48,333 --> 00:37:51,167
Because of us,

393
00:37:51,167 --> 00:37:54,033
we only gave you scars that can't be erased.

394
00:37:54,033 --> 00:37:56,000
Just…

395
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:59,367
Blame me for the rest of your life.

396
00:38:04,767 --> 00:38:07,670
But even resentment was futile.

397
00:38:08,633 --> 00:38:12,533
After Ju Yeon witnessed the incident,

398
00:38:12,533 --> 00:38:15,567
she developed aphasia.

399
00:38:15,567 --> 00:38:17,867
Her father died so miserably,

400
00:38:17,867 --> 00:38:21,140
leaving no savings, and she was sick.

401
00:38:21,933 --> 00:38:23,933
Because my daughter was suffering.

402
00:38:23,933 --> 00:38:27,590
So far from resentment, I even forgot about my husband's death.

403
00:38:28,367 --> 00:38:32,100
I had to become strong enough that there was no business I hadn't tried.

404
00:38:34,167 --> 00:38:39,600
That day, Sae Yan came to me, but I couldn't turn her away.

405
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:42,350
What fault could she have?

406
00:38:42,967 --> 00:38:45,233
If she were to find out,

407
00:38:45,233 --> 00:38:48,933
that bright face would be shadowed for a lifetime.

408
00:38:49,933 --> 00:38:52,800
I forgave her for my own peace of mind.

409
00:38:54,467 --> 00:38:59,133
Ju Yeon, you can follow your heart.

410
00:39:07,333 --> 00:39:09,667
I'm sorry.

411
00:39:09,667 --> 00:39:12,833
I'm so sorry, so sorry.

412
00:39:12,833 --> 00:39:15,867
Sorry, sorry.

413
00:39:36,667 --> 00:39:38,367
I am sorry.

414
00:39:42,533 --> 00:39:44,533
Sae Yan.

415
00:40:01,333 --> 00:40:03,490
It's my fault.

416
00:40:04,133 --> 00:40:06,533
Because of me, your dad…

417
00:40:07,933 --> 00:40:12,367
You and your dad…

418
00:40:14,933 --> 00:40:16,567
Is that why you're just standing like that?

419
00:40:16,567 --> 00:40:19,400
You're not even comforting me.

420
00:40:20,967 --> 00:40:23,400
I'm not qualified for that.

421
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:29,200
It hurts.

422
00:40:30,567 --> 00:40:33,900
Does it hurt? Should I call a doctor?

423
00:40:36,333 --> 00:40:38,367
Hug me.

424
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:53,867
Sis..

425
00:40:54,867 --> 00:40:57,900
- Are you okay? 
 - Yes.

426
00:41:01,433 --> 00:41:04,967
Stop, okay?

427
00:41:14,933 --> 00:41:19,300
I think I should see you once before I go back to Italy.

428
00:41:21,033 --> 00:41:25,550
She just woke up, and you haven't visited even once. Right?

429
00:41:26,267 --> 00:41:28,933
She has gotten a lot better.

430
00:41:28,933 --> 00:41:31,200
I thought you might be wondering.

431
00:41:36,167 --> 00:41:37,733
That…

432
00:41:37,733 --> 00:41:40,700
I heard it from Lee Shin.

433
00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:43,733
That medal…

434
00:41:43,733 --> 00:41:47,000
The medal that was said to be hanging at the alumni reunion house, that…

435
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,667
Yes, I'm aware of it.

436
00:41:48,667 --> 00:41:51,170
That it was you who hung it up.

437
00:41:51,767 --> 00:41:55,500
Yes, but now…

438
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:59,533
I heard that the person who found that medal

439
00:41:59,533 --> 00:42:02,633
is both your lifesaver and your first love.

440
00:42:02,633 --> 00:42:05,420
It's not me.

441
00:42:06,333 --> 00:42:10,710
I just kept it because it was at the house I used to live in.

442
00:42:11,867 --> 00:42:15,933
I'm not your first love.

443
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:19,167
Then…

444
00:42:19,167 --> 00:42:21,600
Then the person who found that medal

445
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:24,030
is the person who saved me?

446
00:42:24,933 --> 00:42:26,933
Is that important?

447
00:42:26,933 --> 00:42:29,933
It's true that you came to like her because you thought she was your first love.

448
00:42:29,933 --> 00:42:32,700
But it's not for that reason that you like her now.

449
00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:37,133
You still like Ju Yeon, right?

450
00:42:38,900 --> 00:42:41,900
Today is the only chance to hold onto her.

451
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:44,500
Because she's leaving in a few hours.

452
00:42:54,333 --> 00:42:57,167
- Ma'am, I'll call every day. 
 - Okay.

453
00:42:57,167 --> 00:43:00,767
Seung Hyun, take care of yourself and avoid catching a cold.

454
00:43:02,300 --> 00:43:04,900
You can come back again.

455
00:43:04,900 --> 00:43:08,600
How can you not shed a single tear?

456
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:11,367
It's enough to have cried and made a fuss for a week.

457
00:43:11,367 --> 00:43:14,133
Oh, dear! Even as a child, you were a crybaby.

458
00:43:14,133 --> 00:43:16,100
As a child?

459
00:43:16,100 --> 00:43:18,530
Did your memories from your childhood come back?

460
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:21,900
So what happened to that medal?

461
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:24,333
Who is the lifesaver?

462
00:43:24,333 --> 00:43:26,133
Could it be…

463
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:43,533
 Isn't it pretty? Here, take this. 

464
00:43:51,067 --> 00:43:54,233
 Stay here, Sae Yan. 

465
00:43:54,233 --> 00:43:56,400
 I'll catch it for you. 

466
00:44:13,067 --> 00:44:14,733
 Please help here! 

467
00:44:14,733 --> 00:44:17,933
 Someone fell into water! 

468
00:44:29,433 --> 00:44:31,250
 Are you okay? 

469
00:44:32,067 --> 00:44:34,400
 Open your eyes! 

470
00:44:36,433 --> 00:44:38,867
 Are you okay? 

471
00:45:07,267 --> 00:45:09,900
 This is the right place. 

472
00:45:15,633 --> 00:45:17,400
 Sae Yan. 

473
00:45:18,133 --> 00:45:22,533
 Sae Yan! Sae Yan! 

474
00:45:25,300 --> 00:45:27,667
 Did she go home? 

475
00:45:29,933 --> 00:45:32,033
 Sae Yan! 

476
00:45:37,833 --> 00:45:41,067
 Did she go to Dad's hospital to find me? 

477
00:45:43,900 --> 00:45:47,433
 No, Ju Yeon. 

478
00:46:17,067 --> 00:46:18,300
 Ju Yeon's dad. 

479
00:46:18,300 --> 00:46:20,267
 It seems that Sae Yan's dad has just come out of prison 

480
00:46:20,267 --> 00:46:22,533
 and he has found out their house. 

481
00:46:22,533 --> 00:46:24,300
 I heard that he's here now. 

482
00:46:24,300 --> 00:46:26,800
 Sae Yan's mother ran away first, saying she was taking Sae Yan with her. 

483
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:31,167
 Stop your voluntary work today and come home quickly. 

484
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:34,067
 Hello? 

485
00:47:05,100 --> 00:47:06,900
 - Mom, where are we going? 
 - Where's Ju Yeon? 

486
00:47:06,900 --> 00:47:09,433
 We can't see her anymore. Let's go quickly. 

487
00:47:09,433 --> 00:47:11,800
 Ju Yeon said she would catch a butterfly for me. 

488
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:13,733
 I told you to hurry. Let's go quickly. 

489
00:47:13,733 --> 00:47:17,633
 Ju Yeon! Ju Yeon! 

490
00:47:26,067 --> 00:47:30,200
 - Oh dear, hey! 
 - Hey, Kun! 

491
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:33,340
 Let's take him to the hospital!­ 

492
00:47:39,633 --> 00:47:43,233
 Ju Yeon, it's Mom. 

493
00:47:44,267 --> 00:47:46,167
 Ju Yeon, wake up, huh? 

494
00:47:46,167 --> 00:47:48,033
 Ju Yeon. 

495
00:48:00,867 --> 00:48:02,933
 Ju Yeon's dad. 

496
00:48:04,033 --> 00:48:05,967
 Honey. 

497
00:48:17,700 --> 00:48:21,433
It wasn't a side effect.

498
00:48:21,433 --> 00:48:26,267
It's just that blurred memories have become vivid again.

499
00:48:27,067 --> 00:48:31,033
Then Ju Yeon… Ju Yeon…

500
00:48:31,033 --> 00:48:35,100
 Yes! Kyeong Ju Yeon is your first love! 

501
00:48:47,733 --> 00:48:51,267
Taxi! Taxi!

502
00:49:01,067 --> 00:49:02,933
Aren't you getting in?

503
00:49:31,033 --> 00:49:36,000
   

504
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:37,500
   

505
00:49:37,500 --> 00:49:39,367
Congratulations.

506
00:49:39,367 --> 00:49:41,700
Continuing with the Young Medical Scientist category.

507
00:49:41,700 --> 00:49:44,767
Kyeong Ju Yeon.

508
00:49:49,067 --> 00:49:52,000
With a paper on the natural healing ability of the human brain,

509
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:55,667
she has contributed to the advancement of mental health medicine.

510
00:50:01,933 --> 00:50:05,420
Congratulations. Please share your acceptance speech.

511
00:50:06,100 --> 00:50:08,300
Thank you.

512
00:50:10,100 --> 00:50:13,900
My patient said this.

513
00:50:13,900 --> 00:50:16,267
"If you bleed, you can apply ointment,

514
00:50:16,267 --> 00:50:20,367
but there's no ointment for a bruised heart.

515
00:50:20,367 --> 00:50:21,900
However,

516
00:50:21,900 --> 00:50:26,467
bad memories also become cherished memories as time passes."

517
00:50:26,467 --> 00:50:29,967
At first, I wondered, "How can a bad memory become a cherished memory?"

518
00:50:29,967 --> 00:50:34,633
I thought, "Isn't that just a so-called mental victory?"

519
00:50:34,633 --> 00:50:38,067
So, for the past three years, I studied

520
00:50:38,067 --> 00:50:41,000
the natural healing abilities of a wounded human brain.

521
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:42,333
Also,

522
00:50:42,333 --> 00:50:46,233
I discovered an amazing function of the brain.

523
00:50:46,233 --> 00:50:51,667
Finding the ointment that heals bruised wounds in the heart.

524
00:50:54,667 --> 00:50:57,467
Please consider our other products as well.

525
00:50:58,730 --> 00:51:02,050
 Please look at the product!­ 

526
00:51:03,300 --> 00:51:06,800
Jeez.

527
00:51:08,133 --> 00:51:10,033
What are you doing here now?

528
00:51:10,033 --> 00:51:13,633
How can a person's face be so splendidly made-up?

529
00:51:13,633 --> 00:51:15,233
I look like an idol, right?

530
00:51:15,233 --> 00:51:17,367
You are just crazy.

531
00:51:17,367 --> 00:51:20,300
Now, I'm scared of you.

532
00:51:20,300 --> 00:51:21,567
No,

533
00:51:21,567 --> 00:51:23,833
you should call me CEO officially.

534
00:51:23,833 --> 00:51:26,067
Our dedicated coach

535
00:51:26,067 --> 00:51:27,167
of my agency.

536
00:51:27,167 --> 00:51:28,900
Ah, yes, CEO.

537
00:51:28,900 --> 00:51:30,533
I told you to listen to what I'm saying.

538
00:51:30,533 --> 00:51:33,633
It's a one-man agency, but I have confidence to achieve as much as Lee Kun's agency.

539
00:51:33,633 --> 00:51:36,967
CEO, our agency's player is not happy with her makeup.

540
00:51:36,967 --> 00:51:38,267
I'm saying I'm better than Lee Kun.

541
00:51:38,267 --> 00:51:39,700
Gosh, sir.

542
00:51:39,700 --> 00:51:41,067
Mr. Lee, congratulations.

543
00:51:41,067 --> 00:51:43,700
Thank you. Let's talk over there.

544
00:51:43,700 --> 00:51:46,733
Ah, the atmosphere is nice.

545
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,200
President.

546
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:53,500
President!

547
00:51:54,533 --> 00:51:56,110
Hold on.

548
00:51:56,867 --> 00:51:59,800
Are you by any chance the president's driver?

549
00:52:01,367 --> 00:52:05,560
Is there no way to meet the chairman, not the president?

550
00:52:06,567 --> 00:52:10,267
Here, I will…

551
00:52:14,167 --> 00:52:17,733
If you let me meet the chairman, I'll take even more care of you.

552
00:52:17,733 --> 00:52:20,333
I reported Lee Kun's condition to him,

553
00:52:20,333 --> 00:52:22,000
but only our agency was ditched, only our company.

554
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:23,967
Is this fair?

555
00:52:25,767 --> 00:52:28,833
With the chairman, huh?

556
00:52:28,833 --> 00:52:31,600
Huh? Chairman.

557
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:34,500
I was waiting after receiving the call.

558
00:52:34,500 --> 00:52:36,790
Oh my, thank you.

559
00:52:37,367 --> 00:52:38,970
The chairman?

560
00:52:43,633 --> 00:52:44,900
Ah, yes.

561
00:52:44,900 --> 00:52:47,533
Mr. Lee, come here.

562
00:52:48,633 --> 00:52:52,167
This is our chairman whom I've been wanting to introduce to you.

563
00:52:52,167 --> 00:52:54,200
Then…

564
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:56,600
is this person the chairman?

565
00:52:58,500 --> 00:53:02,067
Well… Hello, I'm Lee Kun.

566
00:53:02,067 --> 00:53:05,480
Mr. Lee, it's been a while.

567
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:09,300
I dislike showing off,

568
00:53:09,300 --> 00:53:12,780
but I've come to show off to you.

569
00:53:12,780 --> 00:53:14,330
Here.­

570
00:53:14,333 --> 00:53:18,867
Our Dr. Kyeong has come to Korea.

571
00:53:19,833 --> 00:53:22,400
Dr. Kyeong Ju Yeon?

572
00:53:30,367 --> 00:53:33,700
   

573
00:53:33,700 --> 00:53:36,733
I owe Dr. Kyeong Ju Yeon a bit,

574
00:53:36,733 --> 00:53:40,620
so I haven't stopped investing in your company.

575
00:53:41,267 --> 00:53:43,667
Of course, because I'm a businessman,

576
00:53:43,667 --> 00:53:46,440
I also assessed whether it was worth investing in.

577
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:50,633
Excuse me.

578
00:53:50,633 --> 00:53:53,800
If by any chance you meet Dr. Kyeong,

579
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:56,967
please convey my regards impressively.

580
00:53:56,967 --> 00:53:59,733
Please tell her that I paid off the debt.

581
00:53:59,733 --> 00:54:00,833
How so?

582
00:54:00,833 --> 00:54:03,233
Impressively!

583
00:54:03,233 --> 00:54:04,800
Well then...

584
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:06,867
Goodbye, I'm off!

585
00:54:06,867 --> 00:54:09,567
Chairman, let's go together!

586
00:54:16,167 --> 00:54:17,533
Dear, dear.

587
00:54:17,533 --> 00:54:20,433
Did you receive the piggy bank well? That's an Italian pig.

588
00:54:20,433 --> 00:54:25,067
 You said you would give something, I thought you meant to give me money. 

589
00:54:25,067 --> 00:54:26,467
Do you know what happened to me today?

590
00:54:26,467 --> 00:54:28,200
 At the place where I work part-time… 

591
00:54:28,200 --> 00:54:30,000
Seung Hyun, let's eat.

592
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:31,267
Ma'am!

593
00:54:31,267 --> 00:54:33,167
 Yes. 

594
00:54:33,167 --> 00:54:36,100
Auntie, you eat too.

595
00:54:37,533 --> 00:54:41,767
Oh my! Aren't you busy all day?

596
00:54:41,767 --> 00:54:44,800
It's just my routine. What's the side dish for today?

597
00:54:44,800 --> 00:54:46,767
Are those old-fashioned bowls still around?

598
00:54:46,767 --> 00:54:49,000
 It's still the same. 

599
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:50,667
Right! I've made bracelets for our family.

600
00:54:50,667 --> 00:54:53,000
Want to see them? Just a moment.

601
00:54:54,167 --> 00:54:57,000
 Grandma, Mom wants stew. 

602
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:01,000
No, not that stew, the soup next to it.

603
00:55:04,500 --> 00:55:07,033
Ta-da!

604
00:55:07,033 --> 00:55:09,933
What? Where did she go? Ma'am! Seung Hyun!

605
00:55:09,933 --> 00:55:11,133
What? Where did everyone go?

606
00:55:11,133 --> 00:55:14,533
Seung Hyun! Are you doing this to me just because your mom is here?

607
00:55:15,467 --> 00:55:18,700
 I'll wait, chew your food well. 

608
00:55:29,300 --> 00:55:31,333
Professor Han.

609
00:55:31,333 --> 00:55:33,200
Oh dear.

610
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:37,600
How long do we have to keep this relationship a secret?

611
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:39,500
Because it's embarrassing, that's why.

612
00:55:39,500 --> 00:55:42,200
What is embarrassing?

613
00:55:42,200 --> 00:55:46,733
By the way, Dr. Kyeong is also stopping by tomorrow.

614
00:55:46,733 --> 00:55:50,300
Let's clear things up this time.

615
00:55:50,300 --> 00:55:52,167
No, I can't.

616
00:55:52,167 --> 00:55:55,000
I can't because it's embarrassing.

617
00:55:56,133 --> 00:55:59,733
No, we are not children…

618
00:55:59,733 --> 00:56:03,133
What's there to be embarrassed about?

619
00:56:03,133 --> 00:56:06,033
I mean…

620
00:56:06,033 --> 00:56:10,233
I usually consider a man's appearance important when meeting him.

621
00:56:11,500 --> 00:56:14,000
I can't say it because it's embarrassing.

622
00:56:15,733 --> 00:56:20,267
What part of me did she look at?

623
00:56:21,367 --> 00:56:23,900
Am I embarrassing?

624
00:56:25,533 --> 00:56:27,300
Nurse Song.

625
00:56:27,300 --> 00:56:29,167
Nurse Song!

626
00:56:38,333 --> 00:56:40,500
We almost got caught dating.

627
00:56:40,500 --> 00:56:41,867
By the way,

628
00:56:41,867 --> 00:56:44,967
everyone at the hospital knows that those two are dating.

629
00:56:44,967 --> 00:56:46,800
But why are they acting like that?

630
00:56:46,800 --> 00:56:50,433
Usually, a secret office romance is only a secret to the couple involved,

631
00:56:50,433 --> 00:56:54,433
and everyone else knows about it.

632
00:56:54,433 --> 00:56:56,267
Shall we continue...

633
00:56:57,500 --> 00:56:59,767
what we were doing?

634
00:57:11,633 --> 00:57:15,267
Oh my, how beautiful.

635
00:57:15,267 --> 00:57:16,600
Ah, my foot hurts.

636
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:18,400
Oh my! What should I do? Ah, I am sorry.

637
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:19,400
Honey,

638
00:57:19,400 --> 00:57:21,533
you didn't step on this on purpose. Right?

639
00:57:21,533 --> 00:57:23,567
No, no, that's not it…

640
00:57:23,567 --> 00:57:26,867
They say, "Experience tells the truth."

641
00:57:26,867 --> 00:57:30,400
I should have tried dancing like this to know.

642
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:32,000
Since we have a lot of time,

643
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:36,767
it's so nice to share a hobby together like this.

644
00:57:36,767 --> 00:57:39,000
- Sleeping in too… 
 - Ah, sleeping in?

645
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,400
Is waking up at 5:00 a.m. sleeping in?

646
00:57:41,400 --> 00:57:44,667
You have to wake up at 5:00 p.m. for it to be considered sleeping in.

647
00:57:45,500 --> 00:57:47,600
Wait a minute, just a minute.

648
00:57:47,600 --> 00:57:50,167
I have prepared it.

649
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,467
Jeez.

650
00:58:04,767 --> 00:58:05,800
Oh, I am sorry.

651
00:58:05,800 --> 00:58:07,933
Honey,

652
00:58:07,933 --> 00:58:11,133
if dancing doesn't suit you, how about kickboxing as a hobby?

653
00:58:11,133 --> 00:58:15,100
No, no, I think dancing is in my blood.

654
00:58:15,100 --> 00:58:18,133
Oh my.

655
00:58:18,867 --> 00:58:20,567
I've seen a lot about dancing.

656
00:58:20,567 --> 00:58:22,567
Jeez.

657
00:58:22,567 --> 00:58:25,967
- Aren't you going to learn dancing? 
 - No.

658
00:58:26,800 --> 00:58:28,933
- I'm home. 
 - Oh, come on in.

659
00:58:28,933 --> 00:58:30,200
Oh? You came early?

660
00:58:30,200 --> 00:58:32,367
Cool, isn't it?

661
00:58:39,667 --> 00:58:41,733
The kids won't play with me.

662
00:58:41,733 --> 00:58:43,433
- Why? 
 - Why?

663
00:58:43,433 --> 00:58:46,367
Hey, you should get along. You're going to college, aren't you?

664
00:58:46,367 --> 00:58:49,433
They are ostracizing me just because I'm old.

665
00:58:49,433 --> 00:58:54,300
Hey, you still have to go to school. What if the teacher doesn't go to school?

666
00:58:54,300 --> 00:58:56,200
Get along well with others. Oh, right!

667
00:58:56,200 --> 00:58:58,633
I'm hungry, so could you please make some ramyeon?

668
00:58:58,633 --> 00:59:02,067
And add two eggs!

669
00:59:03,333 --> 00:59:04,967
All right.

670
00:59:25,900 --> 00:59:28,933
Feels like you're going to fly away?

671
00:59:28,933 --> 00:59:31,733
Aren't we going to end up in a competition like this?

672
00:59:34,867 --> 00:59:35,900
Yes, Mom.

673
00:59:35,900 --> 00:59:39,400
The awards ceremony is over, and now I'm heading up to Seoul.

674
00:59:39,400 --> 00:59:42,367
I came for the awards ceremony, so I have to go back in a few days.

675
00:59:42,367 --> 00:59:43,933
Right away?

676
00:59:43,933 --> 00:59:48,667
Your sister and Seung Hyun is waiting for you.

677
00:59:48,667 --> 00:59:50,533
Come safely.

678
00:59:50,533 --> 00:59:52,600
Okay, got it.

679
00:59:59,060 --> 01:00:03,990


680
01:00:03,990 --> 01:00:09,070


681
01:00:09,070 --> 01:00:14,030

682
01:00:14,030 --> 01:00:18,850

683
01:00:18,850 --> 01:00:23,920

684
01:01:30,767 --> 01:01:34,867
 You're lucky because you're my first love. 

685
01:01:38,033 --> 01:01:39,690
 Also, 

686
01:01:40,233 --> 01:01:42,733
 because you're my last love. 

687
01:01:59,310 --> 01:02:08,520


688
01:02:13,567 --> 01:02:22,000
♫   Being together with the worries that cling to me ♫

689
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:30,333
♫  Makes the dark night always even darker ♫

690
01:02:30,333 --> 01:02:38,333
♫  Even in this scene where the day is ending and collapses ♫

691
01:02:39,033 --> 01:02:43,300
♫  I am the only one repeating the same old days over and over again ♫

692
01:02:43,300 --> 01:02:49,500
   

693
01:02:55,133 --> 01:03:02,100
♫  It's you ♫

694
01:03:03,400 --> 01:03:10,067
♫  It's you ♫

695
01:03:11,867 --> 01:03:18,900
♫  It's you ♫

696
01:03:19,700 --> 01:03:25,267
♫  I start and end every day alone  ♫
