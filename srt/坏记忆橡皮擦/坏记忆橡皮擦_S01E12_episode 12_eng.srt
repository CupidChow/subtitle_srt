00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:18,110
   

4
00:00:20,870 --> 00:00:22,750
   

5
00:00:25,433 --> 00:00:33,300
   

6
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:39,367
   

7
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:54,400


8
00:01:10,433 --> 00:01:11,933
Mr. Lee.

9
00:01:11,933 --> 00:01:15,867
Pull yourself together. Are you all right?

10
00:01:23,567 --> 00:01:25,767
 Are you all right? 

11
00:01:25,767 --> 00:01:27,400
 Open your eyes. 

12
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:29,433
Are you all right?

13
00:01:29,433 --> 00:01:32,000
Try opening your eyes.

14
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:36,267
Mr. Lee! Mr. Lee!

15
00:01:36,267 --> 00:01:42,133
   

16
00:01:55,533 --> 00:01:57,733
Ju Yeon.

17
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:14,633
Why are you here…

18
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,767
You're awake.

19
00:02:18,767 --> 00:02:23,367
I shall take care of you, Your Majesty.

20
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,633
It's fine. I don't need it.

21
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,133
What have you done?

22
00:02:33,133 --> 00:02:35,967
Your body was covered in sweat and grease,

23
00:02:35,967 --> 00:02:39,800
so I cleaned you up thoroughly.

24
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,300
By the way, why do you speak like that?

25
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:45,267
Didn't I tell you that this is the emperor's care?

26
00:02:45,267 --> 00:02:47,867
You said you would help me find my father,

27
00:02:47,867 --> 00:02:50,900
so consider this as repaying the favor in advance

28
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:54,567
and accept my care.

29
00:02:57,633 --> 00:02:59,767
Did I go overboard?

30
00:02:59,767 --> 00:03:03,200
The truth is, I've watched too many Korean dramas in Italy.

31
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,000
And…

32
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,333
So, I humbly ask for your understanding.

33
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,733
That way of speaking…

34
00:03:14,633 --> 00:03:16,367
Um, well…

35
00:03:16,367 --> 00:03:18,633
Where is Ju Yeon?

36
00:03:18,633 --> 00:03:20,900
She said she's busy.

37
00:03:22,033 --> 00:03:26,300
Does Ju Yeon know that I'm sick?

38
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:29,433
Of course, she even told me the front door code.

39
00:03:29,433 --> 00:03:31,767
Since Si On has now joined the Athletes' Village, so for the time being,

40
00:03:31,767 --> 00:03:35,767
the team doctor isn't needed. She plans to take a few days off.

41
00:03:35,767 --> 00:03:37,633
Why?

42
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:43,667
I'm fine being alone.

43
00:03:43,667 --> 00:03:47,767
Please keep quiet. I need to take your temperature.

44
00:03:47,767 --> 00:03:50,267
Then I'll quickly go out

45
00:03:50,267 --> 00:03:54,290
and bring back a bowl of porridge, Your Majesty.

46
00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:55,930
Okay.

47
00:04:11,067 --> 00:04:12,633
What is this?

48
00:04:12,633 --> 00:04:15,167
It's a plate I cherish.

49
00:04:15,167 --> 00:04:17,900
What kind of plate is so fragile?

50
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:19,033
It's okay, I'll clean it up.

51
00:04:19,033 --> 00:04:22,500
Oh dear, go over there. You'll hurt your hands.

52
00:04:24,767 --> 00:04:27,067
Why are you doing something you usually don't do?

53
00:04:27,067 --> 00:04:30,167
You never used to come near the kitchen.

54
00:04:30,167 --> 00:04:34,200
You once told me to make an effort like other daughters do.

55
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:37,367
I'll be the extra affectionate and homely daughter today.

56
00:04:37,367 --> 00:04:39,267
Seung Hyun, if there's something you want to do with me, please tell me.

57
00:04:39,267 --> 00:04:41,233
Auntie will do everything for you.

58
00:04:41,233 --> 00:04:43,667
It's because I haven't done it, but I do it well when I do.

59
00:04:43,667 --> 00:04:47,000
Hey, that's not where it goes.

60
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,333
Since when?

61
00:04:48,333 --> 00:04:51,400
Ever since we moved in.

62
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:53,767
I got confused.

63
00:04:53,767 --> 00:04:55,767
Ah, that's right. Shouldn't we also prepare for winter?

64
00:04:55,767 --> 00:04:59,000
I took out all the winter blankets and soaked them in water; I plan to wash them by hand.

65
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,933
Huh?

66
00:05:00,933 --> 00:05:02,800
I was going to have those dry-cleaned.

67
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,467
No, I'm better than the dry cleaners, I mean…

68
00:05:05,467 --> 00:05:09,300
Hey, are you not going to work today?

69
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:10,867
That's right, the blankets.

70
00:05:10,867 --> 00:05:12,400
If I wash them quickly, they'll dry faster. Right?

71
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:15,067
- I need to wash the blankets. 
 - Hey, Ju Yeon.

72
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:19,733
Oh my, she's…

73
00:05:46,867 --> 00:05:49,700
She's not calling.

74
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:53,067
Sae Yan must be doing well, right?

75
00:06:00,767 --> 00:06:03,733
   

76
00:06:03,733 --> 00:06:05,400
Dr. Nam.

77
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:08,600
Wait, shouldn't this be covered?

78
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,933
 With the elderly? 

79
00:06:09,933 --> 00:06:13,100
 A married couple? That's really upsetting. 

80
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:16,333
 Elderly? Seriously. 

81
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:25,700
Are you going somewhere nice, excluding an old-timer like me?

82
00:06:30,367 --> 00:06:34,100
We're thinking of going to a great restaurant

83
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:36,633
after today's anniversary event.

84
00:06:36,633 --> 00:06:38,700
Would you like to join us?

85
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:39,933
Is that so?

86
00:06:39,933 --> 00:06:42,767
Is it all right for an old-timer like me

87
00:06:42,767 --> 00:06:48,067
to join a place where young people go?

88
00:06:48,067 --> 00:06:51,267
If you're busy, you don't have to come.

89
00:06:52,367 --> 00:06:55,533
The old-timer is heading home.

90
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:57,967
See you tomorrow.

91
00:06:57,967 --> 00:06:59,167
Is he upset?

92
00:06:59,167 --> 00:07:02,333
- Why does he call himself an old-timer? 
 - Why is he acting like that?

93
00:07:02,333 --> 00:07:05,300
Ah, jeez.

94
00:07:13,667 --> 00:07:16,367
Oh, it's cold.

95
00:07:22,833 --> 00:07:25,500
No, what is this…

96
00:07:27,567 --> 00:07:30,667
The fever is going down.

97
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,767
Fever patch.

98
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,467
It's too cold.

99
00:07:39,467 --> 00:07:42,100
Ice pack.

100
00:07:44,333 --> 00:07:45,600
Oh, it's cold.

101
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:50,600
My body aches seem to have improved,

102
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:53,867
but I feel like I might die from hypothermia.

103
00:07:53,867 --> 00:07:57,010
You were running a high fever earlier.

104
00:07:57,700 --> 00:08:00,600
Let me see.

105
00:08:02,033 --> 00:08:03,767
Why?

106
00:08:03,767 --> 00:08:06,633
Why are you acting like that?

107
00:08:26,633 --> 00:08:28,733
What now?

108
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:31,767
What's that?

109
00:08:31,767 --> 00:08:33,867
Are you awake?

110
00:08:42,533 --> 00:08:47,133
Wasn't this under my armpit earlier?

111
00:08:47,133 --> 00:08:50,300
It was just something under your armpit, so what's the big deal?

112
00:08:52,367 --> 00:08:57,167
If you don't like it, then I'll just stick it up your rear while you're sleeping.

113
00:09:04,933 --> 00:09:06,733
Open.

114
00:09:09,333 --> 00:09:11,267
Ugh, it's hot.

115
00:09:20,033 --> 00:09:23,200
 He won't eat meat that's boiled in water, so give him seafood porridge. 

116
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:26,467
He doesn't eat meat that's boiled in water?

117
00:09:26,467 --> 00:09:28,933
That's unusual.

118
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:31,967
Still, since I'm doing this, I'll make it myself with care

119
00:09:31,967 --> 00:09:36,667
instead of ordering takeout, so don't worry.

120
00:09:36,667 --> 00:09:39,467
Oh, right! She told me to call her.

121
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,500
   

122
00:09:51,833 --> 00:09:53,133
Sis!

123
00:09:53,133 --> 00:09:55,300
 Oh, Sae Yan. 

124
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:57,433
Ju Yeon?

125
00:09:58,233 --> 00:10:01,133
I forgot to give you a call.

126
00:10:01,133 --> 00:10:04,900
Miss, I am taking good care of him as instructed,

127
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:07,967
 so please don't worry, and relax, Lady Ju Yeon 

128
00:10:07,967 --> 00:10:10,600
 and stay strong in health. 

129
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:14,600
Yes, you didn't tell him that I sent you there. Right?

130
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:17,433
Well, I am rather tight-lipped, you know.

131
00:10:17,433 --> 00:10:20,000
If it's your request, I'll follow it closely.

132
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,667
So… how is it?

133
00:10:22,667 --> 00:10:26,400
 Well, it's okay. I can manage, and it's not too difficult. 

134
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:30,400
I guess I'm a bit of a natural caregiver.

135
00:10:31,233 --> 00:10:33,433
Oh.

136
00:10:37,333 --> 00:10:39,800
It's Ju Yeon's call.

137
00:10:42,233 --> 00:10:44,467
Well…

138
00:10:44,467 --> 00:10:46,000
Everything's okay. Right?

139
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,900
Yeah, I'm good. I even got the flu shot already.

140
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:53,567
I'm really fine, so don't worry about me.

141
00:10:58,067 --> 00:10:59,633
Could you…

142
00:10:59,633 --> 00:11:01,367
Could you please…

143
00:11:01,367 --> 00:11:03,267
Could you please pass the phone?

144
00:11:03,267 --> 00:11:07,333
Can you stay late today?

145
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:11,700
Uh, well, I'll be fine as long as I don't have to go to the Athletes' Village tomorrow.

146
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:15,233
Or should I sleep here and go straight to the Athletes' Village tomorrow morning?

147
00:11:15,233 --> 00:11:20,100
What? You'll sleep there? Just the two of you?

148
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:24,867
What? Do you think a sick person would harm me?

149
00:11:24,867 --> 00:11:28,633
Don't worry. Plus, I'm pretty strong.

150
00:11:28,633 --> 00:11:30,833
Hey, could you pass the phone. Please?

151
00:11:30,833 --> 00:11:32,700
Are you awake?

152
00:11:33,467 --> 00:11:36,667
Ju Yeon, I'll call back again.

153
00:11:36,667 --> 00:11:38,233
You're hungry, right?

154
00:11:38,233 --> 00:11:41,700
No, I said please hand over the phone.

155
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:01,267
   

156
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:33,100
   

157
00:12:35,233 --> 00:12:39,967
 The person you are calling is not available. 

158
00:12:44,333 --> 00:12:47,900
   

159
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:55,067
What is this again?

160
00:12:55,067 --> 00:12:56,700
I mean…

161
00:12:56,700 --> 00:13:00,500
The witness to the Han River incident that you have been looking for.

162
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:04,233
The stalker who blackmailed with photos. Isn't this information from that guy?

163
00:13:04,233 --> 00:13:07,233
 The day he left photos in front of the agency, 

164
00:13:07,233 --> 00:13:11,000
 I had searched through all the elevator CCTV footage that day. 

165
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,667
Take a good look.

166
00:13:12,667 --> 00:13:14,533
When he got on, the inside of his jumper was bulging.

167
00:13:14,533 --> 00:13:18,233
 A minute later, when he got on again, the inside of his jumper had slimmed down. 

168
00:13:18,233 --> 00:13:20,533
 Right? 

169
00:13:20,533 --> 00:13:23,100
Hey, I'm pretty good, almost like a detective. Right?

170
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:25,467
It's a middle-aged man?

171
00:13:25,467 --> 00:13:26,933
 In my opinion, 

172
00:13:26,933 --> 00:13:29,300
he's definitely someone who gambles on sports.

173
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:35,433
He's either ordering match-fixing or saying, "I lost money because of you, give me my money back."

174
00:13:35,433 --> 00:13:36,900
You haven't told anyone else, have you?

175
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:40,933
 Of course, I'm tight-lipped. 

176
00:13:40,933 --> 00:13:43,533
Anyway, don't worry.

177
00:13:43,533 --> 00:13:46,700
I'll dig up some more information. Okay?

178
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:48,567
I got it.

179
00:14:00,867 --> 00:14:04,400
Auntie, can't you just act like you normally do?

180
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:06,900
You've been only looking at your phone these days.

181
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:09,233
Would you like me to read you a storybook?

182
00:14:09,233 --> 00:14:10,800
Am I a child?

183
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:13,767
I've read all the English storybooks, too.

184
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:23,733
   

185
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:30,733
Seung Hyun, what is this?

186
00:14:30,733 --> 00:14:33,133
How long has it been here?

187
00:14:34,433 --> 00:14:38,467
The pretty aunt took it out of a big bag last time.

188
00:14:38,467 --> 00:14:40,400
Big bag?

189
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,500
Could it be that one?

190
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:44,367
Yes.

191
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:47,867
Why didn't I think of that?

192
00:14:47,867 --> 00:14:50,233
 Seung Hyun. 

193
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,767
Yes.

194
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:07,033
 Professor Han suggested I try writing an emotion diary. 

195
00:15:07,033 --> 00:15:11,500
 Will this make the wrist pain go away? 

196
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:16,100
 He said to think of him like a brother and to be honest with him about whatever I'm feeling. 

197
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:20,267
 Shall we try writing this "emotions diary"? 

198
00:15:20,267 --> 00:15:25,033
 Look into your heart and write down your feelings 

199
00:15:25,033 --> 00:15:28,667
 you honestly experience. 

200
00:15:28,667 --> 00:15:30,300
 Okay? 

201
00:15:39,433 --> 00:15:44,200
 I wrote down the real reason I had been avoiding 

202
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:46,200
 the professor's eyes. 

203
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:48,267
 Following the professor's advice, 

204
00:15:48,267 --> 00:15:49,633
 honestly. 

205
00:15:49,633 --> 00:15:51,633
 Thank you for your hard work. 

206
00:15:53,367 --> 00:15:55,467
 Oh my. 

207
00:15:56,967 --> 00:15:58,467
 Why is he giving me this? 

208
00:15:58,467 --> 00:16:01,200
 Professor, by any chance, 

209
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:04,900
 you're wearing a wig, right? 

210
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:07,300
 I asked the professor 

211
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:09,967
 if he was wearing a wig. 

212
00:16:09,967 --> 00:16:13,867
 The professor hasn't been accepting appointments for a while. 

213
00:16:13,867 --> 00:16:17,133
 Well, it must be a coincidence. 

214
00:16:18,067 --> 00:16:22,133
 Sometimes he sends parcels to me who lives alone. 

215
00:16:22,133 --> 00:16:25,700
 "Could it be something to eat?" 

216
00:16:28,233 --> 00:16:31,333
 When I open it, it's another gold trophy. 

217
00:16:31,333 --> 00:16:34,200
 He's showing off again. 

218
00:16:37,467 --> 00:16:42,300
 Yeah, the problem was that my last name was Lee. 

219
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:47,000
 Who would have thought I'd end up in the second string instead of the first? 

220
00:16:48,267 --> 00:16:50,733
 Whenever I'm alone, 

221
00:16:50,733 --> 00:16:54,533
 I often imagine being with that girl. 

222
00:16:55,133 --> 00:16:58,067
 If I were to meet that girl, 

223
00:16:58,067 --> 00:17:02,967
 I would give her flowers first. 

224
00:17:02,967 --> 00:17:05,467
 Aren't you cold? 

225
00:17:05,467 --> 00:17:09,300
♫    ♫

226
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:12,500
♫    ♫

227
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:13,967
 Today is my birthday. 

228
00:17:13,967 --> 00:17:16,733
 And it's also that guy's birthday. 

229
00:17:16,733 --> 00:17:19,667
 Shin is the best. 

230
00:17:19,667 --> 00:17:23,267
 On the day I'm the protagonist, of all days, 

231
00:17:23,267 --> 00:17:25,933
 that guy happened to be born on the same day as me. 

232
00:17:27,933 --> 00:17:30,900
 Why is nobody by my side? 

233
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:37,767
 If that girl were alive, would she be by my side? 

234
00:17:37,767 --> 00:17:42,433
 The only one who reached out to me. 

235
00:17:42,433 --> 00:17:45,967
 I want to meet her, but I'm scared, 

236
00:17:45,967 --> 00:17:50,500
 fearing that even she might leave my side. 

237
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:56,800
♫  The day when it becomes dazzlingly bright  ♫

238
00:17:56,800 --> 00:18:04,867
♫  Even if your steps are still heavy  ♫

239
00:18:04,867 --> 00:18:11,033
♫  I will be by your side, as if it's fate  ♫

240
00:18:11,033 --> 00:18:19,333
♫  In sleep, and even in dreams  ♫

241
00:18:19,333 --> 00:18:26,433
♫  I will protect you  ♫

242
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:58,300
Is he a man who stepped right out of a comic book?

243
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:02,833
He looks so good, like he stepped right out of a comic book.

244
00:19:02,833 --> 00:19:04,500
You startled me!

245
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:09,700
Why are you pretending to sleep when you're not? Making me feel guilty for nothing.

246
00:19:13,833 --> 00:19:17,867
Uh, that… Have you seen the remote control?

247
00:19:17,867 --> 00:19:19,733
If you don't know where it is,

248
00:19:19,733 --> 00:19:24,833
please call Ju Yeon and ask her to find it for me.

249
00:19:27,867 --> 00:19:29,467
This one?

250
00:19:32,567 --> 00:19:34,767
No, not that one.

251
00:19:34,767 --> 00:19:37,333
The audio remote control.

252
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:40,700
This one?

253
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:44,433
Well, are you a fairy or what?

254
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:49,033
I mean the batteries for the audio remote control.

255
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:55,367
Uh? There are no batteries here.

256
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,500
Are you calling Ju Yeon?

257
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:14,600
Is she not answering?

258
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:15,933
Huh? That's strange.

259
00:20:15,933 --> 00:20:19,567
I talked on the phone earlier with her.

260
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:31,600
Hello?

261
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,533
Sis?

262
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:38,533
She didn't even answer my call.

263
00:20:38,533 --> 00:20:40,033
Sis, uh…

264
00:20:40,033 --> 00:20:43,333
Do you know where the batteries for the audio remote are?

265
00:20:43,333 --> 00:20:45,267
You don't know?

266
00:20:45,267 --> 00:20:46,400
Uh…

267
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:51,833
If she doesn't know where they are, could you tell her to come here now and find them…

268
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:56,033
Oh, I roughly know where it is. Got it.

269
00:20:59,167 --> 00:21:01,180
Ms. Kyeong Ju Yeon.

270
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,233
I'll bring them to you.

271
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:10,600
Hey, there.

272
00:21:12,267 --> 00:21:14,767
Yes, please go ahead.

273
00:21:14,767 --> 00:21:17,400
 Are you very busy? 

274
00:21:18,333 --> 00:21:20,467
Yes, I'm on my days off for a while.

275
00:21:20,467 --> 00:21:23,100
And Player Cha Si On isn't here, either.

276
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:26,733
Well, that's true, but…

277
00:21:29,133 --> 00:21:34,000
 No, it's just that I'm not feeling well right now. 

278
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:40,000
I heard Sae Yan takes good care of the sick.

279
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,200
She's warm-hearted, so she'll do better than me.

280
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,300
 In many ways. 

281
00:21:52,667 --> 00:21:55,100
 Ms. Jeon Sae Yan is 

282
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:57,767
 so warm and caring towards me. 

283
00:21:57,767 --> 00:22:00,467
She helps me wash my face

284
00:22:00,467 --> 00:22:02,967
and even feeds me porridge.

285
00:22:02,967 --> 00:22:06,233
She really takes good care of me.

286
00:22:06,233 --> 00:22:08,900
Thanks to Jeon Sae Yan, it's much…

287
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:11,767
 Yes, it feels like I'm getting better. 

288
00:22:12,767 --> 00:22:15,767
- But why like this… 
  - That's good to hear. 

289
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:19,570
If you have nothing else to say, I'll hang up.

290
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:22,267
Get well soon.

291
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:38,633
   

292
00:22:38,633 --> 00:22:46,190
♫ With countless thoughts and the wounds inside them  ♫

293
00:22:46,190 --> 00:22:51,930
♫ You light a small light  ♫

294
00:22:51,933 --> 00:22:55,600
 Why are you running out barefoot as if you've committed a crime? 

295
00:22:55,600 --> 00:23:00,533
 Staying with me all night isn't exactly a huge crime. 

296
00:23:00,533 --> 00:23:08,070
♫ Where will it be, that day  ♫

297
00:23:09,633 --> 00:23:10,667
 All right. 

298
00:23:10,667 --> 00:23:12,100
 What are you doing right now? 

299
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:15,067
 If you're going to grumble, at least make sure I can't hear it. 

300
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:19,600
 Let me down. What are you doing? 

301
00:23:22,330 --> 00:23:28,900
♫  Turns away from me and becomes more blurred  ♫

302
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:31,540
Why am I feeling like this?

303

♫  I will walk towards that day  ♫

304
00:23:39,067 --> 00:23:43,000
Ju Yeon! Ju Yeon!

305
00:23:46,433 --> 00:23:48,430
Who are you?

306
00:23:48,430 --> 00:23:50,100
Um, that... Um...

307
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:53,367
Is this Ju Yeon's place by any chance?

308
00:23:53,367 --> 00:23:55,867
Yes, it is.

309
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:59,833
Aren't you Player Lee Shin?

310
00:23:59,833 --> 00:24:01,300
Oh my.

311
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:03,533
Why did you come here…

312
00:24:03,533 --> 00:24:04,800
It's nothing special.

313
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:08,167
I came to see Ju Yeon and you personally.

314
00:24:08,167 --> 00:24:09,667
You're here to see Ju Yeon?

315
00:24:09,667 --> 00:24:13,067
- Here, take this, ma'am. 
 - Oh my.

316
00:24:13,067 --> 00:24:14,233
Please come in.

317
00:24:14,233 --> 00:24:16,967
Oh my.

318
00:24:17,867 --> 00:24:21,933
- Here it is. 
 - Oh my, you've bought so much.

319
00:24:21,933 --> 00:24:23,200
Thank you.

320
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,067
Please have a seat.

321
00:24:25,067 --> 00:24:26,667
- Yes. 
 - Seung Hyun.

322
00:24:26,667 --> 00:24:29,900
Please sit on the sofa here.

323
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:37,867
The house is cozy and nice.

324
00:24:38,633 --> 00:24:40,700
Shall I sit here?

325
00:24:45,633 --> 00:24:48,167
You must be Seung Hyun, right?

326
00:24:48,167 --> 00:24:50,967
I'm a close friend of your aunt.

327
00:24:54,033 --> 00:24:56,200
Please have some of this.

328
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:59,533
- Thank you. 
 - Well, I come across situations like this.

329
00:24:59,533 --> 00:25:04,133
This doesn't happen often, but it does happen occasionally.

330
00:25:04,133 --> 00:25:06,933
It's the first time.

331
00:25:06,933 --> 00:25:08,500
Huh?

332
00:25:09,933 --> 00:25:13,667
Seung Hyun, how about going outside and playing for a while?

333
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:20,033
Oh no, what should I do?

334
00:25:20,033 --> 00:25:22,200
Seung Hyun, you should be more careful.

335
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:23,667
Ah, just a moment please.

336
00:25:23,667 --> 00:25:25,500
It's okay. It's okay, ma'am.

337
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:27,567
Please try to wipe it with this.

338
00:25:27,567 --> 00:25:30,467
- Oh dear, what should I do? 
 - It's okay.

339
00:25:30,467 --> 00:25:31,467
It's okay.

340
00:25:31,467 --> 00:25:33,400
Oh my world.

341
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:35,633
That won't be enough, right?

342
00:25:35,633 --> 00:25:37,267
Just a moment please.

343
00:25:37,267 --> 00:25:39,467
No…

344
00:25:41,633 --> 00:25:43,467
It's fine. It's fine.

345
00:25:43,467 --> 00:25:46,500
It's fine.

346
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:52,633
First, change into this for now.

347
00:25:52,633 --> 00:25:55,333
Meanwhile, I'll try to wash this somehow.

348
00:25:55,333 --> 00:25:56,667
I'm so sorry, what can I do?

349
00:25:56,667 --> 00:25:59,800
Oh no, this belongs to Ju Yeon's father…

350
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:04,033
Yes, the only men's clothes we have are her father's clothes…

351
00:26:04,867 --> 00:26:08,900
He's passed away, but these clothes are new.

352
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:12,433
Ju Yeon always buys new ones for her dad's birthday.

353
00:26:12,433 --> 00:26:14,500
Oh dear.

354
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:16,400
It's an honor, sir. I…

355
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:20,600
Then I'll wash them nicely and return them to you.

356
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:23,667
- The bathroom is over there… 
 - Yes.

357
00:26:28,833 --> 00:26:31,400
It's okay.

358
00:26:39,267 --> 00:26:41,733
It suits you well.

359
00:26:41,733 --> 00:26:43,933
- Take a seat. 
 - Yes.

360
00:26:49,467 --> 00:26:52,500
Don't you need to call Ju Yeon?

361
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:54,033
We don't even know when she'll come back.

362
00:26:54,033 --> 00:26:55,967
Ah, I…

363
00:26:55,967 --> 00:26:59,133
I wanted to give her a surprise.

364
00:26:59,133 --> 00:27:03,833
If it's okay with you, ma'am, I'll wait here until Ju Yeon arrives.

365
00:27:05,467 --> 00:27:08,500
Then, I will enjoy it.

366
00:27:11,333 --> 00:27:12,333
It's sweet.

367
00:27:12,333 --> 00:27:14,433
- Is that so? 
 - Yes.

368
00:27:17,333 --> 00:27:20,967
Grappa.

369
00:27:20,967 --> 00:27:25,333
Add a shot of brandy,

370
00:27:25,333 --> 00:27:29,167
put in some honey,

371
00:27:29,167 --> 00:27:33,467
and mix it well.

372
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:41,933
Isn't it right?

373
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:23,667
You're awake?

374
00:28:23,667 --> 00:28:26,633
What's wrong with you? Did you catch a cold?

375
00:28:26,633 --> 00:28:27,767
No, not at all.

376
00:28:27,767 --> 00:28:30,200
Here, please have this.

377
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:32,433
What is this?

378
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:34,867
Ah, alcohol…

379
00:28:34,867 --> 00:28:37,433
Did you drink alcohol just now?

380
00:28:37,433 --> 00:28:39,067
- You seem drunk? 
 - No.

381
00:28:39,067 --> 00:28:41,133
No, no.

382
00:28:41,133 --> 00:28:42,833
This is…

383
00:28:42,833 --> 00:28:44,500
What was this again?

384
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:47,900
This is a traditional Italian remedy called 'grappa'

385
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:52,567
that my mother passed down.

386
00:28:52,567 --> 00:28:53,633
Grappa.

387
00:28:53,633 --> 00:28:55,970
They say it's grappa.

388
00:28:55,970 --> 00:28:57,730
Pop, pop, grappa, pop.

389
00:28:57,730 --> 00:28:59,233
Its name is grappa.

390
00:28:59,233 --> 00:29:00,833
Drink it. You should try drinking it.

391
00:29:00,833 --> 00:29:01,800
Yes, I'll drink it later.

392
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:03,700
Quickly, you have to drink it now.

393
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:07,033
I got it, so please get some rest.

394
00:29:07,033 --> 00:29:09,167
No, you have to drink this now.

395
00:29:09,167 --> 00:29:13,000
I promised Ju Yeon to take care of the sick.

396
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,567
Did Ju Yeon ask you?

397
00:29:15,567 --> 00:29:18,500
Did Ju Yeon tell you to take care of the sick?

398
00:29:19,367 --> 00:29:20,767
Did Ju Yeon tell you to do this?

399
00:29:20,767 --> 00:29:22,590
Shh.

400
00:29:26,667 --> 00:29:29,300
Why, why, why?

401
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,667
Why?

402
00:29:34,667 --> 00:29:37,000
Jeez, really.

403
00:29:38,467 --> 00:29:41,567
Oh my, this is driving me crazy.

404
00:29:41,567 --> 00:29:44,067
Okay.

405
00:30:37,267 --> 00:30:41,767
Sorry, I thought you were a beautifully looking homeless woman.

406
00:30:41,767 --> 00:30:44,067
Gosh.

407
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:57,367
Why are you sitting like that?

408
00:30:58,300 --> 00:31:00,467
Are you not feeling well?

409
00:31:02,967 --> 00:31:04,567
Where?

410
00:31:04,567 --> 00:31:07,267
I don't know.

411
00:31:07,267 --> 00:31:10,900
I'm feeling unwell, but I don't know where it hurts.

412
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:16,000
I'm a doctor, but I don't know where it hurts.

413
00:31:18,433 --> 00:31:22,533
I've been going to the hospital for nearly 10 years.

414
00:31:22,533 --> 00:31:25,867
I probably know better than most doctors.

415
00:31:25,867 --> 00:31:30,500
Upon first seeing the situation, let's see.

416
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:34,260
Ah, I see.

417
00:31:34,867 --> 00:31:37,167
Goodness.

418
00:31:37,167 --> 00:31:41,000
There's no cure for this illness.

419
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:46,833
If you bleed, you can apply ointment,

420
00:31:46,833 --> 00:31:52,267
but there's no ointment for a bruised heart.

421
00:31:54,067 --> 00:31:57,033
Do you know why there isn't ointment?

422
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:01,733
To stay in the memory for a long time,

423
00:32:01,733 --> 00:32:05,600
even bad memories become

424
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:08,067
cherished memories over time.

425
00:32:51,233 --> 00:32:52,500
Oh, are you awake?

426
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:53,733
It's weird.

427
00:32:53,733 --> 00:32:57,433
I'm sure I was sitting on a chair.

428
00:32:57,433 --> 00:32:59,667
Why does it feel like I'm lying in a bed?

429
00:32:59,667 --> 00:33:01,100
Yes, that's right.

430
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:03,433
You are lying now.

431
00:33:08,433 --> 00:33:11,067
Now, take some medicine.

432
00:33:14,067 --> 00:33:16,367
Drink some water, too.

433
00:33:28,767 --> 00:33:31,500
It's weird.

434
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:35,467
No matter how much beer I drink, I don't get drunk.

435
00:33:35,467 --> 00:33:37,833
Would strong liquor and beer be the same?

436
00:33:37,833 --> 00:33:42,133
You gulped down two bottles of that strong liquor.

437
00:33:45,633 --> 00:33:47,533
Your fever?

438
00:33:49,867 --> 00:33:52,667
How is it? It's gone down, right?

439
00:33:52,667 --> 00:33:54,667
Right.

440
00:33:56,567 --> 00:33:58,633
That's a relief.

441
00:33:58,633 --> 00:34:01,033
Good.

442
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:04,367
Nice.

443
00:34:04,367 --> 00:34:07,600
Grappa is the best, right?

444
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:12,333
And honey! There's honey in it, too.

445
00:34:12,333 --> 00:34:14,967
Grappa, grappa, grappa.

446
00:34:14,967 --> 00:34:17,900
Your drinking habits are really…

447
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:21,133
What's so funny?

448
00:34:22,033 --> 00:34:24,800
I feel nauseous.

449
00:34:25,767 --> 00:34:27,967
When you're sick,

450
00:34:27,967 --> 00:34:31,400
isn't there someone you want to see?

451
00:34:34,667 --> 00:34:37,833
For me, it's my dad.

452
00:34:38,767 --> 00:34:41,533
Even though I've never seen him,

453
00:34:41,533 --> 00:34:44,667
I miss my dad.

454
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,530
You said earlier...

455
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:53,000
that you prepaid for the favor.

456
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:56,767
Don't worry, I'll help you until you find him.

457
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:00,900
Promise me.

458
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:03,167
Okay.

459
00:35:03,167 --> 00:35:05,167
Now, it's done. Right?

460
00:35:06,367 --> 00:35:08,467
Okay, stamp it.

461
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:12,800
Copy.

462
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:15,467
Laminate and input.

463
00:35:16,933 --> 00:35:20,567
I miss Ju Yeon.

464
00:35:20,567 --> 00:35:23,350
I also miss Auntie.

465
00:35:24,067 --> 00:35:26,820
Seung Hyun will be looking for me.

466
00:35:29,367 --> 00:35:32,400
I think I have to go.

467
00:35:34,333 --> 00:35:36,267
Then, goodbye.

468
00:35:36,267 --> 00:35:38,233
Well…

469
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:57,133
Are you my auntie's boyfriend?

470
00:35:58,533 --> 00:36:01,867
No, well… not yet.

471
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:09,833
Seung Hyun, do you like puppies?

472
00:36:09,833 --> 00:36:13,233
This is my puppy Cola. Isn't he pretty?

473
00:36:13,233 --> 00:36:15,667
With pretty Cola and the even prettier auntie,

474
00:36:15,667 --> 00:36:18,167
the four of us should play together. How about it?

475
00:36:18,167 --> 00:36:19,333
With the pretty auntie?

476
00:36:19,333 --> 00:36:21,767
Yes.

477
00:36:21,767 --> 00:36:24,000
All right.

478
00:36:25,667 --> 00:36:28,300
Then what does that pretty auntie like?

479
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:30,667
The pretty auntie?

480
00:36:30,667 --> 00:36:32,133
She likes beer.

481
00:36:32,133 --> 00:36:35,533
You know, the canned beer with you drawn on it.

482
00:36:35,533 --> 00:36:39,133
Why? Did your auntie mention me while looking at my picture?

483
00:36:39,133 --> 00:36:40,833
She was crumpling it up,

484
00:36:40,833 --> 00:36:43,333
and saying she would crush it.

485
00:36:47,067 --> 00:36:50,900
Could it be that the pretty auntie you mentioned is actually Jeon Sae Yan?

486
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:52,800
Why would she be the pretty auntie?

487
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:55,200
Ju Yeon is the prettier auntie.

488
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:57,567
Looks like you don't have a good eye for women, huh?

489
00:36:57,567 --> 00:36:59,567
She just goes around hitting people.

490
00:36:59,567 --> 00:37:01,400
She has a very quirky personality.

491
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:03,300
Mister, just leave now.

492
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:06,467
You say things you shouldn't in front of a child.

493
00:37:06,467 --> 00:37:08,267
Wait! Seung Hyun.

494
00:37:08,267 --> 00:37:10,400
Shall we draw more pictures and play more?

495
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,267
I'm so good at drawing.

496
00:37:12,267 --> 00:37:16,233
With me, drawing tigers and lions…

497
00:37:23,110 --> 00:37:24,740
 ­  

498
00:37:27,767 --> 00:37:29,333
   

499
00:37:29,333 --> 00:37:34,667
 Is this my brother's emotion diary? 

500
00:38:01,567 --> 00:38:04,833
Madam, this is cheating, isn't it?

501
00:38:04,833 --> 00:38:06,267
Can't you win with these cards?

502
00:38:06,267 --> 00:38:08,467
Please teach me a move, madam.

503
00:38:08,467 --> 00:38:11,333
No, master.

504
00:38:11,333 --> 00:38:13,333
The lesson fee is expensive, but all right.

505
00:38:13,333 --> 00:38:14,633
Good.

506
00:38:14,633 --> 00:38:17,267
It's not a celebrity discount, but it's a national team player discount. Okay?

507
00:38:17,267 --> 00:38:19,067
Okay!

508
00:38:27,267 --> 00:38:29,667
- Ju Yeon? 
 - Huh?

509
00:38:29,667 --> 00:38:31,700
Did you know your mother is a gambler?

510
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:35,333
Should I just live here and learn from you, madam?

511
00:38:35,333 --> 00:38:38,067
I'd like it.

512
00:38:40,133 --> 00:38:41,367
Are you coming now?

513
00:38:41,367 --> 00:38:45,500
Player Lee Shin has been waiting for a long time to surprise you.

514
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:49,133
You acted like you'd be right back, but you're late.

515
00:38:50,867 --> 00:38:52,567
Come out.

516
00:38:59,033 --> 00:39:01,033
Here.

517
00:39:05,933 --> 00:39:08,033
Here, gargle it.

518
00:39:15,433 --> 00:39:17,533
Here, water.

519
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:25,667
Now we are completely in sync, aren't we?

520
00:39:25,667 --> 00:39:27,967
Because it's the fourth time.

521
00:39:27,967 --> 00:39:30,633
Since I've sent the fourth taxi,

522
00:39:30,633 --> 00:39:32,000
let's walk from here on.

523
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
Oh, okay. That would be better.

524
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,533
No, wait a minute.

525
00:39:38,567 --> 00:39:40,167
Hop on my back.

526
00:39:40,167 --> 00:39:41,867
Wow.

527
00:39:41,867 --> 00:39:43,967
Wow.

528
00:39:43,967 --> 00:39:47,400
Let's go!

529
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:49,500
Oh, manners hand!

530
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:54,567
Top-notch manners, unwavering comfort, five stars!

531
00:39:54,567 --> 00:39:56,000
Just sleep.

532
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:59,167
I won't leave you abandoned on the street.

533
00:40:01,967 --> 00:40:03,500
What are you doing?

534
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:06,767
Why are you staring at someone so intently?

535
00:40:06,767 --> 00:40:09,033
I saw it while you were sleeping earlier.

536
00:40:09,033 --> 00:40:13,533
From the side, your profile, especially your nose, looks very handsome.

537
00:40:13,533 --> 00:40:15,533
I'm just saying this.

538
00:40:19,333 --> 00:40:21,533
You must have taken after your mother.

539
00:40:21,533 --> 00:40:24,167
Your mother's charm was so overflowing

540
00:40:24,167 --> 00:40:26,867
that I couldn't help but pick up on it myself.

541
00:40:26,867 --> 00:40:29,500
The home-cooked meal was delicious, and she has a hearty personality.

542
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:32,433
What do you think? Don't you think I've gained some weight?

543
00:40:32,433 --> 00:40:34,667
What are you doing now?

544
00:40:36,167 --> 00:40:38,867
I've tried calling and texting you, but you haven't responded.

545
00:40:38,867 --> 00:40:42,733
This is the only way I could think of to reach you.

546
00:40:42,733 --> 00:40:46,100
There must be a reason for avoidance, right?

547
00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:48,800
I know the reason.

548
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:50,333
The kiss that day.

549
00:40:50,333 --> 00:40:52,900
Never mind. There's no need to talk about that.

550
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:55,690
It was to change your brother's mind.

551
00:40:56,367 --> 00:40:59,467
"Seeing me kissing, he'd give up on his feelings for me."

552
00:40:59,467 --> 00:41:00,600
Isn't that it?

553
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:02,790
I like you.

554
00:41:03,533 --> 00:41:05,533
The intention to make my brother let go of his feelings.

555
00:41:05,533 --> 00:41:08,433
You know it's not just that.

556
00:41:08,433 --> 00:41:10,933
You know that I like you

557
00:41:10,933 --> 00:41:14,767
because you're good at reading people's feelings.

558
00:41:14,767 --> 00:41:16,467
Don't pretend you don't know.

559
00:41:16,467 --> 00:41:19,033
It's not that I'm pretending not to know.

560
00:41:19,033 --> 00:41:21,300
I really didn't know.

561
00:41:24,733 --> 00:41:29,367
I don't have prior knowledge on what to do in situations like this.

562
00:41:29,367 --> 00:41:32,580
My expression is clumsy and awkward.

563
00:41:33,233 --> 00:41:35,790
I'll apologize first. I'm sorry.

564
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:39,733
I've never read your feelings.

565
00:41:39,733 --> 00:41:41,067
Also,

566
00:41:41,067 --> 00:41:45,930
I'm not interested in whatever feelings you may have.

567
00:41:46,733 --> 00:41:50,867
So, don't harbor feelings for me.

568
00:41:54,367 --> 00:41:56,400
And,

569
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:59,800
Sae Yan is his true first love.

570
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:02,800
There was no need to deceive me, right?

571
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:08,267
You're angry because I didn't tell you about that.

572
00:42:10,067 --> 00:42:11,720
Even if I knew...

573
00:42:12,533 --> 00:42:14,033
or said it,

574
00:42:14,033 --> 00:42:16,933
would anything change?

575
00:42:16,933 --> 00:42:19,933
Would you have told Jeon Sae Yan?

576
00:42:19,933 --> 00:42:23,267
You can't even tell her because you're afraid my brother will find out.

577
00:42:23,267 --> 00:42:25,400
Then, will you go tell my brother?

578
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:30,267
If he finds out, will you explain everything about how and why his memory

579
00:42:30,267 --> 00:42:32,633
of things might be incorrect?

580
00:42:32,633 --> 00:42:34,900
He underwent a clinical trial, and he experienced side effects?

581
00:42:34,900 --> 00:42:38,700
I might not have said it, but things must have changed now.

582
00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:41,467
What might have changed?

583
00:42:41,467 --> 00:42:44,033
Do you think that if that were the case,

584
00:42:44,033 --> 00:42:46,600
you might not like my brother?

585
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:48,767
The reason you are so cold to me

586
00:42:48,767 --> 00:42:51,140
is entirely because you like my brother.

587
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,530
Isn't it?

588
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:57,333
But you shouldn't do that.

589
00:42:57,333 --> 00:43:00,333
And more so, you shouldn't like him.

590
00:43:00,333 --> 00:43:02,167
In the first place, my brother

591
00:43:02,167 --> 00:43:05,833
doesn't love you, but his first love.

592
00:43:05,833 --> 00:43:11,133
Because that first love you acted isn't really his first love.

593
00:43:11,133 --> 00:43:13,880
The first love that you acted is...

594
00:43:14,733 --> 00:43:16,950
Jeon Sae Yan.

595
00:43:21,333 --> 00:43:23,233
I know as well

596
00:43:23,233 --> 00:43:27,367
that the more I do this, the more you'll push me away.

597
00:43:27,367 --> 00:43:29,733
But it's also my first time,

598
00:43:29,733 --> 00:43:33,167
so without any prior learning on how to behave in such situations,

599
00:43:33,167 --> 00:43:36,633
my expression might be clumsy, unfamiliar, and awkward,

600
00:43:36,633 --> 00:43:38,700
like you.

601
00:43:38,700 --> 00:43:41,600
But I can't help it.

602
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:45,100
Since my feelings don't follow my mind.

603
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:49,000
Like you are now.

604
00:43:49,967 --> 00:43:53,567
Even though my feelings don't follow my mind,

605
00:43:54,133 --> 00:43:57,233
my reason already knows well.

606
00:43:57,233 --> 00:43:59,400
There won't be any issues you are worried about,

607
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:03,467
and I believe you will do the same.

608
00:44:03,467 --> 00:44:05,533
Both of us.

609
00:44:16,533 --> 00:44:18,333
Ju Yeon,

610
00:44:19,467 --> 00:44:21,933
please talk to me.

611
00:44:36,033 --> 00:44:37,567
Are you feeling any better?

612
00:44:37,567 --> 00:44:41,800
You said you were busy, but both of you were here.

613
00:44:42,867 --> 00:44:46,433
Even if I was busy, I came to see Ju Yeon.

614
00:44:53,233 --> 00:44:55,500
What's with Sae Yan? Is she asleep?

615
00:44:55,500 --> 00:44:57,433
She passed out from drinking.

616
00:44:57,433 --> 00:44:59,800
Did she drink alcohol?

617
00:45:01,867 --> 00:45:04,700
- Sae Yan, are you okay? 
 - Yes.

618
00:45:04,700 --> 00:45:06,733
Are you really okay?

619
00:45:06,733 --> 00:45:08,833
It's not okay.

620
00:45:08,833 --> 00:45:11,367
Aren't you worried about me?

621
00:45:11,367 --> 00:45:14,650
Shouldn't you ask me if I'm okay or how I'm feeling?

622
00:45:15,300 --> 00:45:17,550
I was really sick.

623
00:45:18,267 --> 00:45:22,380
I thought about you a lot.

624
00:45:25,267 --> 00:45:27,667
You seem to be okay.

625
00:45:27,667 --> 00:45:30,360
Why should Ju Yeon worry about you?

626
00:45:31,067 --> 00:45:35,000
Ju Yeon, I had a great time today.

627
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:38,867
Please tell your mother that I'm very grateful for the homemade meal.

628
00:45:40,833 --> 00:45:43,367
Sae Yan, get up.

629
00:45:43,367 --> 00:45:44,433
Let's go.

630
00:45:44,433 --> 00:45:46,233
Huh? Home?

631
00:45:47,233 --> 00:45:49,767
I did everything you told me to do really well today.

632
00:45:49,767 --> 00:45:52,467
- Oh, okay. Okay. 
 - Let's go in now.

633
00:45:52,467 --> 00:45:54,867
We'll go in.

634
00:45:54,867 --> 00:45:57,600
Goodbye.

635
00:45:57,600 --> 00:45:59,633
I'll come again.

636
00:45:59,633 --> 00:46:01,500
To bring back your father's clothes.

637
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:03,667
What? Lee Shin?

638
00:46:03,667 --> 00:46:04,933
Why are you here?

639
00:46:04,933 --> 00:46:06,800
- Hey, get lost! 
 - Sae Yan.

640
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:08,767
- Go away! 
 - Sae Yan.

641
00:46:08,767 --> 00:46:11,033
You!

642
00:46:15,233 --> 00:46:17,600
I have to go to the practice room.

643
00:46:19,833 --> 00:46:21,430
Then,

644
00:46:22,233 --> 00:46:24,167
shall we play a game?

645
00:46:31,167 --> 00:46:33,400
It feels like the earth is spinning.

646
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:35,933
Oh, my stomach's churning.

647
00:46:35,933 --> 00:46:38,800
Why did you drink so much?

648
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:40,167
I know.

649
00:46:40,167 --> 00:46:43,833
I tried to cure him with that Italian home remedy, but

650
00:46:43,833 --> 00:46:48,500
I've only ever eaten what my mom makes. So how would I know how to make it?

651
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:52,533
I really tried to take good care of him because you asked me to.

652
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:55,167
I know.

653
00:46:55,167 --> 00:46:58,067
I took care of him by cooking porridge for him, feeding him spoonful by spoonful,

654
00:46:58,067 --> 00:47:00,100
wiping his sweat,

655
00:47:00,100 --> 00:47:03,733
taking off his clothes when he was hot, and dressing him when he was cold.

656
00:47:05,367 --> 00:47:09,900
But at first, it seemed like he was telling me to leave quickly because I was a bother.

657
00:47:09,900 --> 00:47:14,133
As time went on, it seemed to get a bit better.

658
00:47:14,133 --> 00:47:17,267
He even brought me hangover remedies.

659
00:47:17,267 --> 00:47:18,833
I think we got a bit closer.

660
00:47:18,833 --> 00:47:21,800
How can I express this? It's sort of…

661
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:25,667
It feels like we're becoming real friends, real friends!

662
00:47:28,867 --> 00:47:30,500
Hello?

663
00:47:30,500 --> 00:47:34,000
Will it take longer for the ramyeon, ma'am?

664
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,367
- Yes. 
 - Will it take longer for the ramyeon?

665
00:47:36,367 --> 00:47:38,833
Oh, just a moment.

666
00:47:38,833 --> 00:47:41,067
What's going on? What happened?

667
00:47:41,067 --> 00:47:42,733
Did you get scalded?

668
00:47:42,733 --> 00:47:44,200
Are you really okay? What should I do?

669
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:47,833
It's my fault for asking you to cook ramyeon…

670
00:47:47,833 --> 00:47:48,867
Sorry.

671
00:47:48,867 --> 00:47:51,100
Are you really sorry? If you are, don't get hurt.

672
00:47:51,100 --> 00:47:54,400
If you get hurt, it hurts me more.

673
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:57,133
I'm sorry that I'm hurt.

674
00:47:57,133 --> 00:47:59,767
Will this not leave a scar? Are you okay?

675
00:47:59,767 --> 00:48:01,633
It's okay.

676
00:48:01,633 --> 00:48:03,400
Let's eat.

677
00:48:04,567 --> 00:48:07,533
I will do it, I will.

678
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,500
Can you manage?

679
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:15,567
You can't beat me.

680
00:48:15,567 --> 00:48:17,067
Well.

681
00:48:17,067 --> 00:48:19,267
Do you think you can beat me?

682
00:48:19,267 --> 00:48:22,033
I can see your moves clearly.

683
00:48:23,167 --> 00:48:27,600
Even if it's exposed, I can win.

684
00:48:38,733 --> 00:48:40,267
Hey, amateur.

685
00:48:40,267 --> 00:48:41,933
Let's stop now.

686
00:48:41,933 --> 00:48:44,800
Why? Don't you want to win?

687
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:48,900
You're not satisfied until you get whatever you want.

688
00:48:50,233 --> 00:48:51,867
Ah, that's right.

689
00:48:51,867 --> 00:48:54,667
There's something I also want to have.

690
00:48:54,667 --> 00:48:57,367
Are you being honest now?

691
00:48:58,600 --> 00:49:01,000
The one you always wore,

692
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,867
the glow band with your name on it.

693
00:49:05,933 --> 00:49:08,433
I haven't been seeing that around lately.

694
00:49:09,067 --> 00:49:11,467
Did you lose it?

695
00:49:12,900 --> 00:49:14,300
 Please give me an autograph. 

696
00:49:14,300 --> 00:49:17,233
 - Understood. 
 - Please take a photo with me. 

697
00:49:22,433 --> 00:49:24,100
That's at home.

698
00:49:24,100 --> 00:49:25,467
About a thousand of them?

699
00:49:25,467 --> 00:49:27,700
All my fans wear it, you know.

700
00:49:27,700 --> 00:49:29,667
It's my merchandise, after all.

701
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:32,467
So didn't you lose it?

702
00:49:32,467 --> 00:49:34,320
For example,

703
00:49:35,333 --> 00:49:37,320
did you lose it at the Han River or something like that?

704
00:49:46,100 --> 00:49:48,567
Why are you acting like an amateur?

705
00:49:51,067 --> 00:49:53,267
It's just…

706
00:49:53,267 --> 00:49:55,770
because I want one too.

707
00:51:03,533 --> 00:51:07,000
   

708
00:51:48,533 --> 00:51:50,833
Come on, more! Lift it, lift more, lift!

709
00:51:50,833 --> 00:51:52,067
That's right, good.

710
00:51:52,067 --> 00:51:53,800
- Faster, faster! 
 - Okay, go!

711
00:51:53,800 --> 00:51:56,433
Good, yes. Lift it higher.

712
00:51:56,433 --> 00:51:58,800
- Go! 
 - Just a little more!

713
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:00,367
Start.

714
00:52:00,367 --> 00:52:04,467
Yes, he asks you to run a bit faster.

715
00:52:04,467 --> 00:52:06,533
­30-minute break.

716
00:52:06,533 --> 00:52:10,233
The game will start right after a 30-minute break.

717
00:52:10,233 --> 00:52:12,260
- 30-minute break! 
 - Yes.

718
00:52:20,067 --> 00:52:23,233
These are the clothes I gave to Ju Yeon.

719
00:52:23,233 --> 00:52:26,233
I told you that you can date with Ju Yeon over my dead body.

720
00:52:26,233 --> 00:52:27,867
Oh my.

721
00:52:27,867 --> 00:52:29,967
What? Are you the mother of Ju Yeon?

722
00:52:29,967 --> 00:52:32,167
Are you qualified to decide that?

723
00:52:32,167 --> 00:52:33,567
Oh my.

724
00:52:33,567 --> 00:52:36,933
You are not Ju Yeon's type.

725
00:52:36,933 --> 00:52:39,900
- Ju Yeon is… 
 - Ms. Sae Yan!

726
00:52:39,900 --> 00:52:43,033
What kind of things are you talking about?

727
00:52:43,033 --> 00:52:46,633
It's a warning! Be careful!

728
00:52:49,100 --> 00:52:51,367
That was a curse, wasn't it?

729
00:52:51,367 --> 00:52:53,233
I'm not sure what was said,

730
00:52:53,233 --> 00:52:56,867
but her pronunciation is good and pretty.

731
00:52:58,033 --> 00:52:59,267
Oh boy.

732
00:52:59,267 --> 00:53:02,933
The coach's pronunciation is much better.

733
00:53:02,933 --> 00:53:05,900
Hey, since we're on the subject,

734
00:53:05,900 --> 00:53:10,367
uh, could you maybe help me and Sae Yan get together?

735
00:53:10,367 --> 00:53:13,633
You two seem to be very close.

736
00:53:13,633 --> 00:53:16,467
What the heck! What's so pretty about her!

737
00:53:16,467 --> 00:53:19,700
Why are you getting angry again?

738
00:53:19,700 --> 00:53:21,733
Shin.

739
00:53:21,733 --> 00:53:23,667
- What? 
 - What is it?

740
00:53:23,667 --> 00:53:26,267
Hey, drink some water.

741
00:53:26,267 --> 00:53:29,500
And raise your knees when you step.

742
00:53:29,500 --> 00:53:32,233
Don't do it carelessly. Okay?

743
00:53:32,233 --> 00:53:35,233
Your condition's fluctuations are all visible.

744
00:53:35,767 --> 00:53:39,500
   

745
00:53:39,500 --> 00:53:40,633
Go now, what are you doing here?

746
00:53:40,633 --> 00:53:43,933
Hey, Shin! Lee Shin!

747
00:54:02,567 --> 00:54:05,800
Those documents... Player Lee Shin came and picked them up that day.

748
00:54:05,800 --> 00:54:07,633
Did Shin do that?

749
00:54:07,633 --> 00:54:09,500
He said that since you lost your memory due to the accident,

750
00:54:09,500 --> 00:54:11,767
there's no need to bring up your bad memories.

751
00:54:11,767 --> 00:54:14,700
Your younger brother was really worried about you.

752
00:54:16,467 --> 00:54:18,967
There's no record on the CCTV from that day because of the rain.

753
00:54:18,967 --> 00:54:23,267
It'll be recorded based on the testimony of the paramedic and your brother.

754
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:26,167
Still, you're lucky.

755
00:54:26,167 --> 00:54:29,367
It's only because of Player Lee Shin's caliber that he was able to save you.

756
00:54:31,967 --> 00:54:35,567
Was it Shin who saved me?

757
00:54:35,567 --> 00:54:37,667
Didn't you know?

758
00:54:38,733 --> 00:54:41,967
To swim with an unconscious person for such a long time and get him out so quickly…

759
00:54:41,967 --> 00:54:44,867
It was raining that day and the Han River water would have been muddy.

760
00:54:44,867 --> 00:54:49,633
It's strange because one would usually remove shoes before diving in to save someone.

761
00:54:49,633 --> 00:54:51,233
The paramedic said

762
00:54:51,233 --> 00:54:55,067
Player Lee Shin was soaking wet, even his shoes.

763
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:04,967
Please, please, please.

764
00:55:04,967 --> 00:55:07,267
Quickly, quickly.

765
00:55:18,933 --> 00:55:21,067
What's so important about that?

766
00:55:21,067 --> 00:55:25,300
If it was that important, you should have taken good care of it.

767
00:55:25,300 --> 00:55:27,167
Seung Hyun, the emotion diary that was here…

768
00:55:27,167 --> 00:55:29,400
Haven't you seen that diary?

769
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:32,533
While I was drawing yesterday,

770
00:55:32,533 --> 00:55:34,833
I only used a few pages.

771
00:55:34,833 --> 00:55:38,467
A drawing? What about the diary?

772
00:55:38,467 --> 00:55:42,033
I was playing with Shin yesterday,

773
00:55:42,033 --> 00:55:44,800
I left it here.

774
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:49,100
If you mean Shin, is it Player Lee Shin?

775
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:22,700
The public CCTV wasn't confirmed, either.

776
00:56:47,800 --> 00:56:51,700
Yes, the CCTV that overlooks the Han River.

777
00:56:51,700 --> 00:56:53,767
We're at the final stages of our remodeling construction,

778
00:56:53,767 --> 00:56:56,733
so we haven't installed the CCTV yet.

779
00:56:58,700 --> 00:57:02,867
Is there no other CCTV nearby?

780
00:57:02,867 --> 00:57:06,633
I mean, apart from that public CCTV.

781
00:57:06,633 --> 00:57:09,500
Well, I'm not really sure.

782
00:57:10,433 --> 00:57:13,433
Okay, I see.

783
00:57:15,600 --> 00:57:17,733
Just a moment, please.

784
00:58:05,367 --> 00:58:08,067
Everyone, stay hidden so you don't get caught by Shin.

785
00:58:08,067 --> 00:58:10,467
If a suspicious person appears, you know what to do. Right?

786
00:58:10,467 --> 00:58:12,467
- Yes. 
 - Yes.

787
00:58:20,500 --> 00:58:22,600
   

788
00:58:26,367 --> 00:58:28,333
Please move and put it back in its place.

789
00:58:28,333 --> 00:58:31,000
Yes, thank you.

790
00:58:39,600 --> 00:58:42,433
   

791
00:58:47,600 --> 00:58:48,600
Yes.

792
00:58:48,600 --> 00:58:52,233
Hey, your brother is really driving me crazy.

793
00:58:52,233 --> 00:58:53,800
What?

794
00:58:54,833 --> 00:58:57,033
He left the Athletes' Village without saying anything?

795
00:58:57,033 --> 00:58:59,933
I don't know. It seemed like he had an urgent matter come up.

796
00:58:59,933 --> 00:59:03,633
He ran out all of a sudden without a word and isn't answering calls.

797
00:59:03,633 --> 00:59:05,533
I'm now making up stories to the coach.

798
00:59:05,533 --> 00:59:07,300
Anyway, it's total chaos right now.

799
00:59:07,300 --> 00:59:08,967
Hey, you need to do something about it quickly.

800
00:59:08,967 --> 00:59:11,867
Hey, you know what happens if Shin gets kicked out of the national team?

801
00:59:11,867 --> 00:59:14,700
Hey, Si On will be kicked out along with him.

802
00:59:14,700 --> 00:59:17,533
It's doubles, you know.

803
00:59:17,533 --> 00:59:21,733
All right, I got it. I'll look for him.

804
00:59:51,100 --> 00:59:53,300
Ah, what! What is it?

805
00:59:53,300 --> 00:59:55,533
I was just trying to get an autograph.

806
00:59:55,533 --> 00:59:56,900
Please let go.

807
00:59:56,900 --> 00:59:59,667
I'm really just trying to get an autograph.

808
01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:02,467
   

809
01:00:07,233 --> 01:00:10,733
Oh my! Player Lee Shin. Player Lee Shin!

810
01:00:14,600 --> 01:00:16,333
Please, talk to me.

811
01:00:16,333 --> 01:00:18,533
It's a misunderstanding.

812
01:00:21,233 --> 01:00:23,567
No, just a moment.

813
01:00:24,633 --> 01:00:26,733
Just a moment.

814
01:01:00,700 --> 01:01:03,433
Excuse me. Are you all right?

815
01:01:07,310 --> 01:01:10,930
  ­ 

816
01:01:11,800 --> 01:01:14,067
No.

817
01:01:14,067 --> 01:01:16,833
No! No!

818
01:01:22,340 --> 01:01:32,080


819
01:01:37,233 --> 01:01:40,833
♫  Drowning  ♫

820
01:01:40,833 --> 01:01:47,033
♫  In an ocean of grey  ♫

821
01:01:48,667 --> 01:01:52,300
♫  Running  ♫

822
01:01:52,300 --> 01:01:57,333
♫  Running backwards to you  ♫

823
01:01:57,333 --> 01:02:02,333
   

824
01:02:02,333 --> 01:02:04,133
 First, we need to find Shin. 

825
01:02:04,133 --> 01:02:06,000
 Can we check where he is right now? 

826
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,433
 I'm planning to organize my thoughts during this opportunity. 

827
01:02:08,433 --> 01:02:10,367
 You know my father? 

828
01:02:10,367 --> 01:02:12,100
 There are sightings of Shin on social media. 

829
01:02:12,100 --> 01:02:13,667
 I become myself when I'm with you. 

830
01:02:13,667 --> 01:02:16,200
 It's as if you're making the dead me breathe again. 

831
01:02:16,200 --> 01:02:18,433
 If you're misunderstanding something… 

832
01:02:18,433 --> 01:02:19,567
 There isn't such a thing. 

833
01:02:19,567 --> 01:02:22,067
 You know this is just an old memory game from the start, right? 

834
01:02:22,067 --> 01:02:23,567
 I'm so lonely. 

835
01:02:23,567 --> 01:02:25,500
 Why is there no one by my side? 

836
01:02:25,500 --> 01:02:27,833
 I'm worried that your bad memories will return. 

837
01:02:27,833 --> 01:02:30,400
 Since the mouse experiment was a success, if you don't cooperate, there's nothing I can do. 

838
01:02:30,400 --> 01:02:32,500
 I'll have no choice but to speak directly to the subject. 

839
01:02:32,500 --> 01:02:34,960
 Your brother is in danger.
