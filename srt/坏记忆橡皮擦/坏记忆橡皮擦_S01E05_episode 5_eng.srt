1
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:06,120


2
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:07,910
 Kim Jaejoong 

3
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:14,420
 Jin Se Yeon 

4
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:18,450
 Lee Jong Won 

5
00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:22,550
 Yang Hye Ji 

6
00:00:25,533 --> 00:00:33,400
   

7
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:39,367
   

8
00:00:55,133 --> 00:00:57,933
Well. Why are you here…

9
00:00:57,933 --> 00:01:00,267
This is a very strange situation, you know?

10
00:01:00,267 --> 00:01:04,700
Obviously, this is my house and no one should be here.

11
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:09,300
On top of that, you're even taking my suitcase?

12
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:11,367
It's not what you think. I swear.

13
00:01:11,367 --> 00:01:15,233
Do you mean, trespassing and being caught red-handed while stealing?

14
00:01:15,233 --> 00:01:17,067
Please hear me out first.

15
00:01:17,067 --> 00:01:19,900
The thing is that for a matter of procedure, I need your ID card.

16
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:21,667
But all your family members were busy,

17
00:01:21,667 --> 00:01:24,067
so they gave me the door passcode.

18
00:01:24,067 --> 00:01:26,633
I'm telling the truth. You can call your parents and ask.

19
00:01:26,633 --> 00:01:28,200
I see. Because you needed my ID card?

20
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,033
Yes.

21
00:01:29,033 --> 00:01:31,267
Is it because my ID card is so heavy

22
00:01:31,267 --> 00:01:32,967
and so big

23
00:01:32,967 --> 00:01:35,867
that you needed to put it in my suitcase?

24
00:01:37,433 --> 00:01:40,400
As for this suitcase…

25
00:01:41,967 --> 00:01:44,100
It's mine.

26
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:48,033
But why is it that your suitcase is at my house?

27
00:01:48,033 --> 00:01:49,167
From my house…

28
00:01:49,167 --> 00:01:52,833
I brought it from my house.

29
00:01:52,833 --> 00:01:54,700
Even though I'm very busy,

30
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:58,533
since we have some previous interactions,

31
00:01:58,533 --> 00:02:02,100
I wanted you to have more medical support in any way possible.

32
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:05,900
Like doing a favor since we know each other?

33
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:08,967
So, you went out of your way and came here just for me?

34
00:02:08,967 --> 00:02:11,667
Only for my benefit?

35
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:19,700
It'd be really great if you could consider it

36
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:23,533
a doctor's dedication and commitment to help a patient.

37
00:02:23,533 --> 00:02:26,500
So, did you find what you were looking for?

38
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:28,900
As for my ID card,

39
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:31,667
I got it reissued not too long ago.

40
00:02:31,667 --> 00:02:35,000
Where could my credit card be…

41
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,267
Well, my credit card…

42
00:02:38,033 --> 00:02:40,167
Oh, my.

43
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,833
Well…

44
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:49,267
I'd be grateful if you could look for my reissued credit card, too.

45
00:02:49,267 --> 00:02:50,900
Sure.

46
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,733
What was my passcode?

47
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,960
  ­ 

48
00:03:12,667 --> 00:03:15,600
I found both your ID and credit card.

49
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:19,900
Dr. Ju Yeon. Nice.

50
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:23,000
What's wrong with your hand? Are you hurt?

51
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,100
No, I'm fine.

52
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:28,433
Where's the first-aid kit?

53
00:03:31,767 --> 00:03:33,500
There you go.

54
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:36,100
That stung so much.

55
00:03:43,367 --> 00:03:45,400
Let's see.

56
00:03:47,667 --> 00:03:49,400
Your hand.

57
00:03:56,367 --> 00:03:58,067
This…

58
00:04:06,933 --> 00:04:10,567
I did that as your doctor. You know that, right?

59
00:04:11,267 --> 00:04:15,633
Doctors have feelings, too. Don't you agree?

60
00:04:15,633 --> 00:04:17,167
No, I don't.

61
00:04:17,167 --> 00:04:21,267
How can your patients get better if you're providing consultation without any emotions?

62
00:04:21,267 --> 00:04:23,367
Instead, I'm on their side.

63
00:04:23,367 --> 00:04:27,033
I don't tell them if they're right or wrong. Instead, I always take their side.

64
00:04:27,033 --> 00:04:28,300
That's my role.

65
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:30,367
So, you're on my side

66
00:04:30,367 --> 00:04:33,167
since I'm your patient?

67
00:04:35,633 --> 00:04:38,833
You could say that.

68
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,700
How reassuring.

69
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:46,367
I'm on your side, too.

70
00:04:46,367 --> 00:04:48,933
No matter what happens,

71
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:51,733
I'm on your side.

72
00:04:59,067 --> 00:05:02,200
On the same side.

73
00:05:02,967 --> 00:05:07,467
   

74
00:05:08,233 --> 00:05:11,867
I guess you're scared of being caught by the reporters?

75
00:05:11,867 --> 00:05:14,333
I'm worried for you.

76
00:05:14,333 --> 00:05:17,300
My personal life has been completely shaken up, just like my mental state right now.

77
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:18,567
Why didn't you answer my calls?

78
00:05:18,567 --> 00:05:21,433
And why did you block my comments on your social media accounts?

79
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,500
- Ms. Napoli Sae Yan. 
 - Yes?

80
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:26,300
- Listen carefully. 
 - Okay.

81
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:27,733
As for me,

82
00:05:27,733 --> 00:05:31,400
I've never fallen in love with anyone.

83
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,567
I understand how you feel about me, even coming all the way to my house.

84
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:37,133
But I hope you pull yourself together and meet someone nice.

85
00:05:37,133 --> 00:05:38,367
Whatever.

86
00:05:38,367 --> 00:05:39,933
Have you seen my bracelet?

87
00:05:39,933 --> 00:05:41,900
- Bracelet? 
 - Yes, I can't find it anywhere.

88
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:44,367
I think I dropped it in your car.

89
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:49,067
Oh, dear.

90
00:05:49,067 --> 00:05:50,933
It was a good try.

91
00:05:50,933 --> 00:05:53,300
A bracelet sure sounds more natural than shoes.

92
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:54,800
That bracelet means a lot to me. Okay?

93
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,000
What kind of a bracelet is it that it's so important?

94
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,867
Send me the model information. I'll buy it and send it to you.

95
00:05:59,867 --> 00:06:01,300
No, actually.

96
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:03,700
How much is it?

97
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:06,367
It's just pocket change.

98
00:06:08,067 --> 00:06:10,367
How much is it?

99
00:06:10,367 --> 00:06:13,600
Let me pay you ahead before I hit you.

100
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:17,033
When it comes to money, I have it lying around as much as you do.

101
00:06:17,033 --> 00:06:20,833
Look every corner and find it, and send it over to this address.

102
00:06:23,867 --> 00:06:26,033
You little…

103
00:06:26,033 --> 00:06:27,667
I'm going.

104
00:06:27,667 --> 00:06:29,667
Yes.

105
00:06:55,333 --> 00:06:58,667
   

106
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,467
 This… 

107
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,933
Stop looking at me like that.

108
00:07:16,933 --> 00:07:20,067
You're just making me the bad guy.

109
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:24,900
The more you look at me like that, I'll end up making you more heartbroken.

110
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:26,900
 I'm on your side, too. 

111
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:29,367
 No matter what happens, 

112
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:32,533
 I'm on your side. 

113
00:07:32,533 --> 00:07:35,900
"I'm on your side, too."

114
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:41,733
But I can't… be on your side.

115
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:47,033
No, I can't get soft-hearted.

116
00:07:47,033 --> 00:07:49,733
Let's not get soft-hearted.

117
00:07:49,733 --> 00:07:52,933
   

118
00:07:53,867 --> 00:07:56,400
Your taste has become refined.

119
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:58,260
No, the other side.

120
00:07:58,267 --> 00:08:01,167
I'm at your service, sir.

121
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,400
There's a vacancy.

122
00:08:06,967 --> 00:08:08,833
To be an investor.

123
00:08:08,833 --> 00:08:11,400
You spoiled brat.

124
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,867
I teach after-school programs. I have no money to invest.

125
00:08:15,867 --> 00:08:17,267
Not you.

126
00:08:17,267 --> 00:08:18,933
I'm going to get Chairman Won to invest.

127
00:08:18,933 --> 00:08:21,567
- Chairman Won? 
 - Yes.

128
00:08:21,567 --> 00:08:23,767
- The big player in the investing world? 
 - Yep.

129
00:08:23,767 --> 00:08:27,567
Chairman Won who is the mega investor in both biotech and sports industries?

130
00:08:27,567 --> 00:08:28,467
Yes, that's right.

131
00:08:28,467 --> 00:08:29,700
Do you even know what he's really like?

132
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:34,133
There are so many rumors about him, calling him a thug and even a psychic.

133
00:08:34,133 --> 00:08:36,933
But in reality, no one has ever seen Chairman Won.

134
00:08:36,933 --> 00:08:39,033
Even the companies that have received funding…

135
00:08:39,033 --> 00:08:41,200
No one has seen Chairman Won, I know.

136
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:45,433
He has an agent. You can find out who it is. Right?

137
00:08:45,433 --> 00:08:47,400
Gosh, I'm not sure.

138
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:50,400
I heard that Big Picture Agency received investment from there, too.

139
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,967
When you think about it, CEO Hong is quite competent too.

140
00:08:52,967 --> 00:08:56,500
They say the agent is very picky and has a nasty temper.

141
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:59,800
Why would they give money to a nobody like you?

142
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:03,800
I'm saying that because I'm just worried about you, Kun.

143
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:07,933
All right. I'll ask around, okay?

144
00:09:07,933 --> 00:09:11,200
Can you set up a meeting for me tomorrow?

145
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,600
I'm taking this.

146
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,400
What? As for that flower… Hey, wait a second.

147
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:17,667
Hey, wait! The meaning of that flower is… Hold on.

148
00:09:17,667 --> 00:09:19,867
Yellow tulip. Yellow tulip…

149
00:09:19,867 --> 00:09:21,760
    
 It symbolizes…

150
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,848
   

151
00:09:24,667 --> 00:09:26,733
Good thing he didn't hear about it.

152
00:09:26,733 --> 00:09:28,700
He had to pick that one out of all these.

153
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:36,700
   

154
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:16,533
Aren't you getting in?

155
00:10:25,467 --> 00:10:29,033
I found a beautiful flower that resembles you.

156
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:42,033
Right here.

157
00:10:43,233 --> 00:10:46,200
Stop kidding around.

158
00:10:52,533 --> 00:10:55,300
 The door is opening. 

159
00:10:56,767 --> 00:10:59,000
I'll call you.

160
00:11:05,167 --> 00:11:08,767
I wish I could just hit him.

161
00:11:12,167 --> 00:11:14,600
Well…

162
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,133
Where was it again?

163
00:11:16,133 --> 00:11:17,333
- Dr. Song? 
 - Yes?

164
00:11:17,333 --> 00:11:19,233
How about a drink today?

165
00:11:19,233 --> 00:11:20,733
Oh, shall we?

166
00:11:20,733 --> 00:11:21,667
Sounds good.

167
00:11:21,667 --> 00:11:24,467
Then, let's also ask Dr. Yeo and Dr. Te Oh.

168
00:11:24,467 --> 00:11:26,200
Should we ask Dr. Kyeong Ju Yeon too?

169
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,300
Come on.

170
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:29,767
Don't turn a drinking party into a seminar.

171
00:11:29,767 --> 00:11:32,167
Let's exclude Elsa.

172
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:35,800
I really imagined it already. I haven't even had a drink yet,

173
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,533
but I'm already hungover.

174
00:11:37,533 --> 00:11:39,100
Hello.

175
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:41,567
- Oh, my. Hello. 
 - Sis!

176
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:44,633
Sae Yan?

177
00:11:44,633 --> 00:11:47,533
Did you forget about our dinner plan?

178
00:11:47,533 --> 00:11:51,067
Dinner… plan?

179
00:11:51,833 --> 00:11:54,100
Let's go.

180
00:11:56,267 --> 00:11:58,367
You've never had an official job. Right?

181
00:11:58,367 --> 00:12:02,200
You can't get friendly with people you meet for work. It makes you less alert.

182
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:07,267
Especially if you're working in a field that deals with human lives.

183
00:12:07,267 --> 00:12:08,767
How suffocating.

184
00:12:08,767 --> 00:12:12,933
They say, even a fleeting encounter is a kind of fate.

185
00:12:12,933 --> 00:12:17,200
Maintaining some distance can help block out emotions.

186
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,033
Granted, you won't be able to develop positive feelings toward someone,

187
00:12:19,033 --> 00:12:22,267
but you won't be able to develop negative feelings, either.

188
00:12:22,267 --> 00:12:24,900
But those who love you will get heartbroken

189
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:27,067
since you won't give them the time of day.

190
00:12:27,067 --> 00:12:30,567
There are people who you shouldn't give the time…

191
00:12:30,567 --> 00:12:31,833
of day.

192
00:12:31,833 --> 00:12:35,667
You just thought of someone. You have someone on your mind, don't you?

193
00:12:35,667 --> 00:12:40,167
That's nonsense. I was thinking about my boyfriend.

194
00:12:40,167 --> 00:12:43,733
Boyfriend? Do you have a boyfriend?

195
00:12:43,733 --> 00:12:46,967
How come everyone reacts like that?

196
00:12:46,967 --> 00:12:48,533
Do I look like I can't get a boyfriend or something?

197
00:12:48,533 --> 00:12:53,233
Exactly. I never even imagined it.

198
00:12:53,233 --> 00:12:55,867
Anyway, I need to show my emotions

199
00:12:55,867 --> 00:12:58,067
only when it's necessary.

200
00:12:58,067 --> 00:13:01,200
Unnecessary emotional exchanges only lead to needless misunderstandings.

201
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,467
Only when it's necessary?

202
00:13:02,467 --> 00:13:05,800
Then, do you show your emotions to your boyfriend at least?

203
00:13:12,567 --> 00:13:13,700
He went home already.

204
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:15,233
Professor Han went home already?

205
00:13:15,233 --> 00:13:19,900
Gosh. This is so disappointing.

206
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:21,667
Then, I have no choice,

207
00:13:21,667 --> 00:13:24,967
but to consult with Dr. Kyeong.

208
00:13:24,967 --> 00:13:26,200
She's here, right?

209
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,600
She left for the day already.

210
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,533
She left for the day?

211
00:13:28,533 --> 00:13:30,633
Yes, she left for the day.

212
00:13:30,633 --> 00:13:33,333
I see. Understood.

213
00:13:33,333 --> 00:13:35,500
Have a good rest.

214
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:43,367
I guess I'll have to sleep here tonight.

215
00:13:50,533 --> 00:13:53,033
Why are you staring at me like that?

216
00:13:53,033 --> 00:13:54,967
You used to say,

217
00:13:54,967 --> 00:13:57,900
"Brother, face me when you sleep."

218
00:13:57,900 --> 00:14:00,700
"Brother, face me when you sleep." You used to say that

219
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:02,900
and cling to me all the time.

220
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:05,733
That's why I'm facing you as I sleep. Okay?

221
00:14:05,733 --> 00:14:10,133
That was so long ago. You remember that?

222
00:14:11,633 --> 00:14:15,067
So, you do have good memories of me.

223
00:14:15,067 --> 00:14:17,833
Good memories? Good memories, my foot.

224
00:14:17,833 --> 00:14:21,133
Just go to sleep looking at my handsome face.

225
00:14:21,133 --> 00:14:23,167
No, thanks.

226
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:32,367
I thought you had no memories of me left.

227
00:14:37,967 --> 00:14:43,700
How were we like as brothers in the memories I can't remember?

228
00:14:44,567 --> 00:14:46,933
Just as you described.

229
00:14:50,967 --> 00:14:53,433
I clung to you

230
00:14:53,433 --> 00:14:56,567
and you always played pranks on me.

231
00:14:59,533 --> 00:15:01,633
I see.

232
00:15:03,333 --> 00:15:08,633
Hey, Shin. Sit up.

233
00:15:08,633 --> 00:15:11,500
Why are you bothering me again?

234
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:14,033
Well, the thing is…

235
00:15:14,033 --> 00:15:16,167
What?

236
00:15:18,433 --> 00:15:21,300
Since you're up, turn off the lights.

237
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:23,767
I'm tired.

238
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:37,300
Even if you want to look at my face, turn off the lights.

239
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:39,500
Okay?

240
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:12,500
It's only morning. Are you drinking beer already?

241
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,967
You haven't even eaten, right?

242
00:16:14,967 --> 00:16:16,367
Well…

243
00:16:16,367 --> 00:16:19,467
It's like an aperitif, you know?

244
00:16:22,970 --> 00:16:24,610
Here you go!

245
00:16:25,367 --> 00:16:27,100
It's a gift I got for you from Italy.

246
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:32,100
It's a set of unique, couple shirts I ordered to wear with you originally,

247
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:34,500
but you and your boyfriend can wear them together.

248
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:35,500
No, thanks.

249
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:36,767
- I don't wear couple shirts. 
 - "I don't wear couple shirts."

250
00:16:36,767 --> 00:16:38,467
Yes, I knew you'd say that.

251
00:16:38,467 --> 00:16:42,233
How are you so predictable?

252
00:16:43,333 --> 00:16:44,567
But I wonder if he feels the same.

253
00:16:44,567 --> 00:16:47,400
I can handle my own business.

254
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:50,267
Sure, fine.

255
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:55,233
I was going to tell you my secrets for captivating men,

256
00:16:55,233 --> 00:16:57,033
but if you really don't want to hear,

257
00:16:57,033 --> 00:16:58,567
then, I'll just…

258
00:16:58,567 --> 00:17:02,300
No, I didn't mean that I don't want to hear about them.

259
00:17:46,367 --> 00:17:48,767
Hello, ma'am.

260
00:17:59,933 --> 00:18:03,800
He did high-intensity training all day yesterday.

261
00:18:12,433 --> 00:18:14,767
Is this because you made him wear new shoes?

262
00:18:14,767 --> 00:18:18,133
The thing is that it was such an important…

263
00:18:18,133 --> 00:18:20,167
Okay, got it.

264
00:18:20,167 --> 00:18:25,067
It was such an important sponsor, so we had no choice.

265
00:18:30,667 --> 00:18:33,000
It must've been so painful for him.

266
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,067
Look at this blood.

267
00:18:35,067 --> 00:18:36,167
Honey.

268
00:18:36,167 --> 00:18:38,967
It was such an important sponsor, so he had no choice.

269
00:18:38,967 --> 00:18:42,730
- Yes, that's right. 
 - Shall I make your feet bleed, too?

270
00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:44,420
Got it?

271
00:18:45,433 --> 00:18:47,833
This sponsor…

272
00:18:48,833 --> 00:18:53,100
This sponsor offered to cover all the coaching fees, so I had no choice.

273
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:58,800
It was for Shin's long-term benefit. Yes, that's right.

274
00:19:25,867 --> 00:19:27,367
You know who I am, don't you?

275
00:19:27,367 --> 00:19:29,333
Without time to break them in,

276
00:19:29,333 --> 00:19:32,900
I heard that you told him to wear these on the day of the match.

277
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:38,200
I guess you want a free ride off Shin's blood, sweat, and tears.

278
00:19:43,033 --> 00:19:46,600
The penalty? I'll pay it.

279
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,433
Coaching fees?

280
00:19:48,433 --> 00:19:52,533
I can cover them even if I have to sell my own body.

281
00:19:52,533 --> 00:19:57,867
Don't you ever think about leeching off my child.

282
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:01,720
Oh my, fu—!

283
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:04,500
Why don't you get the rehab treatment first so that you can run well?

284
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:07,600
They canceled my commercial shoot because my rehab article came out.

285
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,233
I should've put out the press release later.

286
00:20:09,233 --> 00:20:11,300
I shouldn't have announced it first.

287
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:13,667
Mister, you're kind of like one, two, eight, and nine.

288
00:20:13,667 --> 00:20:14,800
One, two, eight, and nine?

289
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:17,100
You're too extreme.

290
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:19,433
I've been barely hanging on by compensating for my skills with my good reputation.

291
00:20:19,433 --> 00:20:21,867
What if I get forgotten like this?

292
00:20:21,867 --> 00:20:24,933
I'm too extreme, I see.

293
00:20:24,933 --> 00:20:26,533
Hey.

294
00:20:26,533 --> 00:20:31,967
Even an airplane needs to go incredibly fast from the ground…

295
00:20:31,967 --> 00:20:33,400
to fly high.

296
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,433
Just take care of your body.

297
00:20:34,433 --> 00:20:38,500
Such concerns are for me to handle. That's what our agency is for.

298
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:41,133
You're super cool,

299
00:20:42,067 --> 00:20:43,467
but can I really trust you?

300
00:20:43,467 --> 00:20:45,667
Don't think of me as one, three, five, and seven.

301
00:20:45,667 --> 00:20:47,700
One, three, five, and seven?

302
00:20:48,433 --> 00:20:51,700
Don't underestimate me.

303
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:55,300
I'll let my mom know.

304
00:20:56,300 --> 00:21:00,700
My mom said, if you don't pay a down payment within ten days, the deal is off.

305
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:03,633
- What? 
 - You have the rest.

306
00:21:03,633 --> 00:21:06,033
Hey.

307
00:21:06,033 --> 00:21:08,167
Hey.

308
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:11,233
Hey.

309
00:21:13,367 --> 00:21:15,767
There are no more snacks.

310
00:21:15,767 --> 00:21:18,233
No more snacks. None.

311
00:21:18,233 --> 00:21:19,833
This isn't food.

312
00:21:19,833 --> 00:21:23,200
Hey, I said, no more snacks. None.

313
00:21:23,733 --> 00:21:24,933
No way.

314
00:21:24,933 --> 00:21:27,567
He'll cooperate with the testing only if we let him go out.

315
00:21:27,567 --> 00:21:28,867
We can't force him, you know?

316
00:21:28,867 --> 00:21:32,433
But what if he goes out and runs into someone he knew in the past?

317
00:21:32,433 --> 00:21:33,933
That's possible,

318
00:21:33,933 --> 00:21:37,767
but still, the subject's opinion matters.

319
00:21:37,767 --> 00:21:39,800
Then, let's have him go with a guardian at least.

320
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,433
He can't go alone.

321
00:21:41,433 --> 00:21:44,567
- Wow, unbelievable! 
 - He's so handsome.

322
00:21:48,933 --> 00:21:52,033
No, you can't give me something you've already sipped.

323
00:21:52,033 --> 00:21:53,300
I'm thankful too.

324
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:55,667
I'm a fan.

325
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:02,300
♫  So high  ♫

326
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:05,667
♫  Look at me, look at me, look at me  ♫

327
00:22:05,667 --> 00:22:10,167
♫  So high  ♫

328
00:22:10,167 --> 00:22:14,200
♫  Look at me, look at me, look at you  ♫

329
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:22,200
♫  Only to me, can you please come  ♫

330
00:22:27,333 --> 00:22:29,167
You can't go out without a guardian.

331
00:22:29,167 --> 00:22:31,433
So, are you my guardian for today?

332
00:22:31,433 --> 00:22:33,900
A medical guardian.

333
00:22:37,567 --> 00:22:40,933
I don't like your habitual melodramatic gaze.

334
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:45,567
I have hands, too. This old-fashioned way of hitting on me is also not allowed.

335
00:22:45,567 --> 00:22:48,133
That's not what I was doing.

336
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:52,700
Can't I even look at the GPS?

337
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:56,900
 The racehorses have started off with vigor. 

338
00:22:56,900 --> 00:23:00,900
 The racehorses on the inside continue to maintain their speed. 

339
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:03,767
 The racetrack? 

340
00:23:03,767 --> 00:23:05,267
 See? 

341
00:23:05,267 --> 00:23:09,033
 You didn't come here to go on a date with me, did you? 

342
00:23:09,033 --> 00:23:10,867
Please, let's keep our work and personal life—

343
00:23:10,867 --> 00:23:12,667
Let's keep them separate.

344
00:23:12,667 --> 00:23:14,233
Although I like you,

345
00:23:14,233 --> 00:23:17,567
I won't tolerate you interrupting my work.

346
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:24,833
Did you come here to find your old memory by any chance?

347
00:23:24,833 --> 00:23:26,467
Do you think you've done horse racing in the past?

348
00:23:26,467 --> 00:23:29,567
Do you remember something at least? Is that it?

349
00:23:29,567 --> 00:23:31,533
Are you curious about me?

350
00:23:31,533 --> 00:23:32,933
Yes, as a doctor.

351
00:23:32,933 --> 00:23:36,733
I'm curious about you, even more than myself.

352
00:23:37,367 --> 00:23:41,700
Well, let's take turns asking each other questions then.

353
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:44,333
How did you and Dr. Te Oh start to date?

354
00:23:44,333 --> 00:23:47,033
He confessed his feelings the day before I left for the U.K. Why did you come here?

355
00:23:47,033 --> 00:23:48,467
To secure investments.

356
00:23:48,467 --> 00:23:49,800
What do you like about him?

357
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:51,067
He's smart. What investment?

358
00:23:51,067 --> 00:23:52,500
Business investment.

359
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:54,033
Would you consider breaking up with him?

360
00:23:54,033 --> 00:23:54,933
Never.

361
00:23:54,933 --> 00:23:56,533
Does this relate to your past memories?

362
00:23:56,533 --> 00:23:58,467
No.

363
00:23:59,833 --> 00:24:02,067
Is he…

364
00:24:02,933 --> 00:24:05,100
your first love?

365
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:10,333
Yes, he is.

366
00:24:18,133 --> 00:24:20,400
I'll find out where the VIP room is.

367
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:23,900
Stay put and wait here.

368
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:26,967
I don't have much time. You'll be quick, right?

369
00:24:26,967 --> 00:24:28,767
Right?

370
00:24:28,767 --> 00:24:31,833
Gosh, seriously.

371
00:24:32,667 --> 00:24:37,833
Now that I think about it, I've never been to a place like this since I'm always working.

372
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:47,700
 Senior! 

373
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:49,900
 Can we meet up tonight? 

374
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:51,533
Who is it?

375
00:24:51,533 --> 00:24:54,200
No one important. Let's go.

376
00:24:55,333 --> 00:24:56,533
Oh, my.

377
00:24:56,533 --> 00:24:58,133
What's all this?

378
00:24:58,133 --> 00:25:00,367
It stinks.

379
00:25:02,767 --> 00:25:05,500
Who the hell did this?

380
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:45,700
"Agency Goon"?

381
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:48,900
I'm Lee Kun of Sports Agency Goon.

382
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:51,133
Here's the business proposal.

383
00:25:51,133 --> 00:25:53,300
We're not just a simple agency.

384
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:56,033
We aggregate every single action of athletes into big data,

385
00:25:56,033 --> 00:25:59,467
manage the players, and match them with teams. We're highly specialized.

386
00:25:59,467 --> 00:26:03,667
I've come to offer you an investment opportunity.

387
00:26:05,467 --> 00:26:08,633
Get him out of here. Please leave now.

388
00:26:10,833 --> 00:26:15,167
Please give me a minute. Sir, I wouldn't bet on horse number five.

389
00:26:19,433 --> 00:26:21,633
Statistics and winning odds of each horse's performance

390
00:26:21,633 --> 00:26:23,600
and performance trends based on weather and climate.

391
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:27,700
I'm sure you've made your predictions based on AI.

392
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:30,967
However, animals gauge the weather with their keen senses.

393
00:26:30,967 --> 00:26:34,400
Typical data can't capture the entirety of the day's weather.

394
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:37,867
If it was raining and cloudy first

395
00:26:37,867 --> 00:26:38,900
and then cleared up,

396
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:41,933
you could only input "rain" or time-specific records into the data pool.

397
00:26:41,933 --> 00:26:44,833
Based on the analysis of more than 6,000 pieces of data per second,

398
00:26:44,833 --> 00:26:49,900
the speed of horse number five will decrease significantly on a day like today.

399
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:53,267
Pardon me.

400
00:26:53,267 --> 00:26:56,433
I don't know much about horse racing, but please allow me to add to what he said.

401
00:26:56,433 --> 00:26:59,100
Horse number five seemed psychologically unstable.

402
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:00,433
Its eyes were dull,

403
00:27:00,433 --> 00:27:04,900
and it screamed like a frightened child.

404
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:07,500
And you are?

405
00:27:08,167 --> 00:27:10,633
I'm a psychiatrist.

406
00:27:10,633 --> 00:27:14,200
She'll manage the mental health of our agency's athletes

407
00:27:14,667 --> 00:27:17,200
as the team doctor.

408
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:20,433
 In one minute, the betting for the first race in Seoul will close. 

409
00:27:20,433 --> 00:27:21,933
So,

410
00:27:21,933 --> 00:27:24,450
which horse would you bet on?

411
00:27:25,067 --> 00:27:26,967
If it were me…

412
00:27:31,467 --> 00:27:34,933
   

413
00:27:39,367 --> 00:27:43,433
   

414
00:27:48,933 --> 00:27:51,767
 The betting for the first race in Seoul has closed. 

415
00:27:51,767 --> 00:27:53,333
I'd bet on horse number three.

416
00:27:53,333 --> 00:27:54,667
But…

417
00:27:54,667 --> 00:27:56,500
Be careful.

418
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:59,140
How can you treat my words…

419
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:04,750
Okay, let's leave.

420
00:28:05,930 --> 00:28:08,633
You should've picked any number quickly. Why did you have to provoke him?

421
00:28:08,633 --> 00:28:10,767
 At this moment, horse number three successfully takes the lead from the outside! 

422
00:28:10,767 --> 00:28:13,300
He'll call me in again.

423
00:28:15,733 --> 00:28:17,800
Over here.

424
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:20,133
Excuse me.

425
00:28:20,133 --> 00:28:22,800
The boss wants you to come back in.

426
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:28,433
 Defying expectations, horse number three confidently secures first place! 

427
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,667
The team doctor has a prior appointment today.

428
00:28:32,667 --> 00:28:36,467
Please ask him to contact us with a new meeting date.

429
00:28:36,467 --> 00:28:38,900
Please excuse me.

430
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,400
Are you playing hard to get?

431
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:44,667
Are they still there?

432
00:28:44,667 --> 00:28:46,767
One second.

433
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:53,967
They're on a call right now… Oh, they're going back.

434
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:56,100
How did you know?

435
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:58,433
Did you really use big data or something to guess it right?

436
00:28:58,433 --> 00:28:59,800
It was luck.

437
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:02,533
You can't predict a horse's condition 100 percent.

438
00:29:02,533 --> 00:29:06,433
You can only increase the probability a little.

439
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:11,233
Why do you want to get investments?

440
00:29:11,233 --> 00:29:16,000
There are many legal avenues for betting money such as horse races or sports games.

441
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,233
You could make money from there and invest in your business.

442
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:22,367
I am a former athlete

443
00:29:22,367 --> 00:29:24,067
and I love sports.

444
00:29:24,067 --> 00:29:25,733
It's not unethical to earn money that way,

445
00:29:25,733 --> 00:29:28,567
but I don't want to exploit sports.

446
00:29:28,567 --> 00:29:32,133
Because that's my business principle.

447
00:29:33,233 --> 00:29:34,830
Let's go.

448
00:29:36,467 --> 00:29:41,367
Then, did he intentionally delay giving his answer earlier, too?

449
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:01,067
I know, you have hands too.

450
00:30:01,067 --> 00:30:04,133
But you don't have feelings for your patients, so it shouldn't matter. Right?

451
00:30:04,133 --> 00:30:08,233
Because that's your business principle.

452
00:30:18,850 --> 00:30:21,950
 ­  

453
00:30:24,967 --> 00:30:26,667
I'm hungry.

454
00:30:26,667 --> 00:30:32,000
If you're hungry, why don't we grab dinner before heading in?

455
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,467
Senior!

456
00:30:34,467 --> 00:30:35,567
 Where are you? 

457
00:30:35,567 --> 00:30:38,000
I've just got back to the hospital with the patient.

458
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,733
Are you done with your work, Senior?

459
00:30:39,733 --> 00:30:40,800
 I'll be done soon. 

460
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:43,000
 Let's meet in the small meeting room at 8:00. 

461
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,567
 Wait until I get there. Okay? 

462
00:30:44,567 --> 00:30:46,033
In the small meeting room?

463
00:30:46,033 --> 00:30:48,467
No, it's fine. I'll wait for you there.

464
00:30:48,467 --> 00:30:51,000
Come as soon as you finish. Okay?

465
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,633
Don't go anywhere today.

466
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:58,900
What's with him?

467
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:00,533
No, you can't.

468
00:31:00,533 --> 00:31:04,933
Make sure you don't let Kyeong Ju Yeon or anyone outside the operating room find out.

469
00:31:04,933 --> 00:31:06,400
Today's testing is highly confidential.

470
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:09,967
Shouldn't we inform the patient about the nature of the test?

471
00:31:09,967 --> 00:31:11,433
Considering it even involves general anesthesia.

472
00:31:11,433 --> 00:31:16,300
It's a matter that has already been consented by the subject's family members.

473
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:18,767
I'll take responsibility, so don't worry.

474
00:31:18,767 --> 00:31:21,933
But still, what if our supervisors find out…

475
00:31:21,933 --> 00:31:28,333
 So, do you plan to name it a joint study by the psychiatry and neurosurgery departments? 

476
00:31:28,333 --> 00:31:32,833
 It's a joint study since the research was conducted by the Brain Science Research Center. 

477
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:37,333
 You're not ambitious enough. 

478
00:31:37,333 --> 00:31:41,500
 Our neurosurgery department should get more credit for it. 

479
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:45,100
 Initially, it started out for psychiatric research 

480
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:48,700
 and Dr. Kyeong Ju Yeon is the first author of the paper too. 

481
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:51,167
 Facts are not important. 

482
00:31:51,167 --> 00:31:54,300
 What's important is turning them into facts. 

483
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:58,910
"Facts aren't important. What's important is turning them into facts."

484
00:31:59,567 --> 00:32:01,767
It's an order from someone higher up.

485
00:32:06,933 --> 00:32:09,067
Excuse me, Mr. Lee Kun.

486
00:32:15,867 --> 00:32:18,067
When is Dr. Kyeong supposed to arrive?

487
00:32:18,067 --> 00:32:20,433
We've informed Dr. Kyeong,

488
00:32:20,433 --> 00:32:23,800
but she can't come due to an important commitment.

489
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:28,433
Everyone is waiting.

490
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:40,420
Okay, then.

491
00:32:41,067 --> 00:32:43,333
Let's just start.

492
00:32:45,067 --> 00:32:47,133
It won't take long.

493
00:32:50,167 --> 00:32:52,800
I'll count to five.

494
00:33:02,367 --> 00:33:04,767
 Why is that punk here? 

495
00:33:05,667 --> 00:33:09,233
 Then, what about his meeting with Ju Yeon? 

496
00:33:10,267 --> 00:33:12,067
Let's get started.

497
00:33:29,467 --> 00:33:31,400
 Light the candle. Swoosh. 

498
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:32,567
 Lay out flower petals. Ta-da. 

499
00:33:32,567 --> 00:33:35,800
 With an impactful gaze and a smile, 

500
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:38,133
 say, surprise! 

501
00:33:44,167 --> 00:33:47,133
Why do people get so excited about things like this?

502
00:33:53,433 --> 00:33:55,700
How pretty.

503
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:17,433
Have you been waiting long?

504
00:34:17,433 --> 00:34:18,667
Yes, I just finished.

505
00:34:18,667 --> 00:34:21,500
I'll be right there. Okay?

506
00:34:25,467 --> 00:34:27,267
Senior?

507
00:34:52,733 --> 00:34:54,600
Have you been waiting long?

508
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:57,867
That's why I told you not to wait today.

509
00:34:57,867 --> 00:35:01,267
Since Ju Yeon's waiting, I'll just show my face for a second.

510
00:35:01,267 --> 00:35:04,233
You're always talking about Dr. Kyeong.

511
00:35:04,233 --> 00:35:06,033
Is there something going on between you two?

512
00:35:06,033 --> 00:35:08,400
We're just colleagues.

513
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:11,833
Since you're afraid of Ju Yeon, I'm making sure you don't run into her.

514
00:35:11,833 --> 00:35:14,867
Why do we have to meet up on the stairs and in the car?

515
00:35:14,867 --> 00:35:19,033
I can't handle a secret relationship. It's too nerve-wracking.

516
00:35:19,033 --> 00:35:22,033
It's because it'd be hard on you if we made our relationship public.

517
00:35:22,033 --> 00:35:24,367
Let's say, we're dating openly.

518
00:35:24,367 --> 00:35:28,800
Do you think it'll still be easy for me to deceive Ju Yeon and sneak you out?

519
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:31,033
   

520
00:35:31,033 --> 00:35:32,167
Oh, I almost forgot.

521
00:35:32,167 --> 00:35:34,067
Let me go by the small meeting room for five minutes and come back.

522
00:35:34,067 --> 00:35:36,133
I have to wait again?

523
00:35:36,133 --> 00:35:38,467
Can't you just text her that you can't come?

524
00:35:38,467 --> 00:35:41,567
It's not because of Ju Yeon. I left my jacket there.

525
00:35:41,567 --> 00:35:43,000
Okay, fine.

526
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,033
I'll be right back.

527
00:35:44,033 --> 00:35:46,933
- Let me come with you. 
 - Okay, let's go.

528
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:53,900
Wait, hold on.

529
00:37:03,167 --> 00:37:05,233
What shall I do?

530
00:37:25,567 --> 00:37:29,033
I'm hungry. I'm going first.

531
00:37:29,033 --> 00:37:30,433
Wait.

532
00:37:30,433 --> 00:37:33,833
Okay, fine. Let's go together.

533
00:37:51,767 --> 00:37:54,200
 Answer me. 

534
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:56,000
 You don't want to? 

535
00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:58,600
 Then, 

536
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:01,467
 when you come back from the U.K., let's date. Okay? 

537
00:38:01,467 --> 00:38:04,400
 The day you come back will be our first day of being together. 

538
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:06,300
 Promise me. 

539
00:38:57,267 --> 00:39:00,967
Stop being so pathetic like this and go confront him right now.

540
00:39:00,967 --> 00:39:02,667
Or slap him hard at least.

541
00:39:02,667 --> 00:39:04,767
It's not Senior's fault.

542
00:39:04,767 --> 00:39:07,733
I was mistaken like a fool.

543
00:39:07,733 --> 00:39:10,900
After all, I was the one who was mistaken,

544
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:13,533
so he probably had no choice.

545
00:39:13,533 --> 00:39:17,867
I know those feelings better than anyone else.

546
00:39:19,233 --> 00:39:21,333
I'm just...

547
00:39:21,867 --> 00:39:26,433
so mad at myself and frustrated that I can't even cry.

548
00:39:26,433 --> 00:39:30,333
I've already told you, that being able to cry is a luxury.

549
00:39:30,333 --> 00:39:33,333
Isn't it more like deceit than luxury?

550
00:39:33,333 --> 00:39:35,867
You're deceiving yourself.

551
00:39:35,867 --> 00:39:39,333
You're a psychiatrist, and yet you're not being honest with your own feelings.

552
00:39:40,933 --> 00:39:42,967
My feelings?

553
00:39:45,767 --> 00:39:48,200
Do you want me to tell you how I really feel?

554
00:39:49,667 --> 00:39:52,633
Please stop caring about my business.

555
00:39:52,633 --> 00:39:54,933
That's how I truly feel,

556
00:39:54,933 --> 00:39:57,467
my feelings about you.

557
00:39:57,467 --> 00:39:58,700
Stop pretending to be tough.

558
00:39:58,700 --> 00:40:00,167
Don't be so clingy.

559
00:40:00,167 --> 00:40:02,367
If I stop being clingy,

560
00:40:02,367 --> 00:40:05,200
will you stop pretending to be tough?

561
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:07,033
Yes.

562
00:40:07,033 --> 00:40:10,967
Let's stop. Both of us.

563
00:40:23,110 --> 00:40:30,990
 ­  

564
00:40:54,033 --> 00:41:01,567
♫  The silent streets are filled  ♫

565
00:41:01,567 --> 00:41:09,067
♫  With countless thoughts and the wounds inside them  ♫

566
00:41:09,067 --> 00:41:16,633
♫  You light a small light in a corner  ♫

567
00:41:16,633 --> 00:41:23,433
♫  Of my heart that I had ignored  ♫

568
00:41:23,433 --> 00:41:30,800
♫  Where will it be, that day  ♫

569
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:38,733
♫  How much further do I have to go before I can see  ♫

570
00:41:38,733 --> 00:41:45,400
♫  Even if that unreachable dream  ♫

571
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:49,267
- Come out. 
 - Mr. Lee, why are you doing this?

572
00:41:50,567 --> 00:41:53,967
Don't touch what's mine ever again.

573
00:41:53,967 --> 00:41:56,500
If not, you little…

574
00:41:56,500 --> 00:42:01,070
♫  I will walk towards that day  ♫

575
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:30,067
Now I understand how he must've felt.

576
00:42:30,733 --> 00:42:35,200
When I kept my mouth shut all this time during the counseling sessions,

577
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:38,400
he must've felt so frustrated and curious.

578
00:42:40,233 --> 00:42:42,800
I feel apologetic to Professor Han.

579
00:42:44,533 --> 00:42:49,267
This was dropped on the floor.

580
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:54,400
So, it really was here.

581
00:42:55,733 --> 00:43:00,233
Thanks for the ride. I'll just walk from here.

582
00:43:07,233 --> 00:43:09,433
Drink this before you go.

583
00:43:10,300 --> 00:43:13,233
I'm not good with words, so I'm not sure what to say.

584
00:43:13,233 --> 00:43:18,100
When I'm feeling down, drinking this boosts my spirits.

585
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:25,533
Did you only buy one?

586
00:43:25,533 --> 00:43:29,900
I can't have sweet things at night. It makes my heart pound.

587
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:37,800
Just have a sip.

588
00:43:38,433 --> 00:43:41,267
But I can't sleep if I have something sweet at night.

589
00:44:13,700 --> 00:44:16,733
It's so sweet I can't handle it.

590
00:44:20,060 --> 00:44:21,750
Ugh, I don't know!

591
00:44:23,388 --> 00:44:26,467
   

592
00:44:26,467 --> 00:44:28,633
I have no appointments scheduled today. Right?

593
00:44:28,633 --> 00:44:30,000
No, you don't.

594
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,067
But Dr. Kyeong.

595
00:44:32,067 --> 00:44:34,433
You don't look so well lately.

596
00:44:34,433 --> 00:44:36,620
Are you ill?

597
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:38,833
No, I'm fine.

598
00:44:38,833 --> 00:44:41,800
Dr. Song, please check on Mr. Lee Kun's condition.

599
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:44,133
And, is Dr. Nam in the lab?

600
00:44:44,133 --> 00:44:46,800
I think so.

601
00:44:49,433 --> 00:44:52,467
I'm sorry. I am late.

602
00:44:52,467 --> 00:44:55,200
Dr. Yeo, can you manage the aseptic room today…

603
00:44:55,867 --> 00:44:57,800
Please…

604
00:45:04,167 --> 00:45:06,400
I'll be in the library for a while.

605
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:08,633
Okay.

606
00:45:34,833 --> 00:45:37,233
Dr. Kyeong!

607
00:45:37,233 --> 00:45:40,333
We have a situation. Mr. Lee Kun...

608
00:45:40,333 --> 00:45:42,467
Discharged?

609
00:45:42,467 --> 00:45:46,067
Don't you know we have to follow the subject for three months?

610
00:45:46,933 --> 00:45:52,033
His parents had consented already, but…

611
00:45:52,033 --> 00:45:54,800
And we can't tell the subject the truth.

612
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:56,433
It seems that

613
00:45:56,433 --> 00:46:01,233
the conflict between him and Ju Yeon is the issue.

614
00:46:01,667 --> 00:46:03,533
See?

615
00:46:03,533 --> 00:46:05,800
I told you. I said I didn't feel good about it. Right?

616
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:08,010
How will we monitor the subject?

617
00:46:08,567 --> 00:46:13,567
I'll meet with the subject's family to persuade them again.

618
00:46:16,667 --> 00:46:18,667
But what if you can't?

619
00:46:24,333 --> 00:46:26,267
We have no choice.

620
00:46:26,267 --> 00:46:28,900
Exclude Kyeong Ju Yeon from this research.

621
00:46:28,900 --> 00:46:30,167
Pardon?

622
00:46:30,167 --> 00:46:32,467
But Kyeong Ju Yeon is the one who started this research in the first place.

623
00:46:32,467 --> 00:46:35,048
How can we exclude her?

624
00:46:35,048 --> 00:46:35,900
   

625
00:46:35,900 --> 00:46:39,300
Here are the subject's test results conducted by the neurosurgery department.

626
00:46:41,300 --> 00:46:46,067
You conducted tests on the subject without telling me?

627
00:46:47,033 --> 00:46:50,600
Whenever he's with Kyeong Ju Yeon, his test results always come out inconsistent

628
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:52,367
because of his feelings.

629
00:46:52,367 --> 00:46:54,000
We'll have to exclude Kyeong Ju Yeon

630
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:57,200
and shift the research direction to neurosurgery.

631
00:46:57,200 --> 00:46:58,500
Pardon?

632
00:46:58,500 --> 00:47:03,800
   

633
00:47:06,033 --> 00:47:08,300
It's open.

634
00:47:12,133 --> 00:47:13,800
Our son, you're amazing!

635
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:15,367
Make it big.

636
00:47:15,367 --> 00:47:17,567
Congratulations.

637
00:47:18,300 --> 00:47:21,067
This is so great.

638
00:47:21,067 --> 00:47:22,633
- Hey, Cola! 
 - Cola!

639
00:47:22,633 --> 00:47:25,067
He's going to shed.

640
00:47:25,067 --> 00:47:26,467
Cola, come here.

641
00:47:26,467 --> 00:47:28,570
Cola.

642
00:47:28,570 --> 00:47:30,760
 ­Cola, come here! 

643
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:32,767
- Hey, come here. 
 - He's going to shed!

644
00:47:32,767 --> 00:47:35,533
There we go. We have to hang this up.

645
00:47:35,533 --> 00:47:38,767
Dad, this is such a thing of the past. Who does this nowadays?

646
00:47:38,767 --> 00:47:40,100
We have to make a wish.

647
00:47:40,100 --> 00:47:41,400
You must make it big. Give me that.

648
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:42,467
Dad, this…

649
00:47:42,467 --> 00:47:43,667
Gosh, what are you doing?

650
00:47:43,667 --> 00:47:45,333
Dad, the rice wine!

651
00:47:45,333 --> 00:47:47,333
No, Dad!

652
00:47:47,333 --> 00:47:49,333
You try it too. It's refreshing.

653
00:47:49,333 --> 00:47:50,467
Go back in, please.

654
00:47:50,467 --> 00:47:53,067
- Drink up now. 
 - Gosh, if it gets damp there…

655
00:47:53,833 --> 00:47:55,733
- So refreshing. 
 - Dad. Gosh, Mom!

656
00:47:55,733 --> 00:47:56,867
- Mom! 
 - Yes?

657
00:47:56,867 --> 00:47:58,167
Where's the towel?

658
00:47:58,167 --> 00:48:00,433
What's going on all of a sudden?

659
00:48:00,433 --> 00:48:01,867
My gosh, did you spill something?

660
00:48:01,867 --> 00:48:03,133
Mom.

661
00:48:03,133 --> 00:48:05,033
Don't go out to eat. Just eat at home.

662
00:48:05,033 --> 00:48:07,900
I have to work. This is my office, you know? I have to eat out.

663
00:48:07,900 --> 00:48:09,133
I have to hold meetings.

664
00:48:09,133 --> 00:48:12,133
Just don't ask for more later.

665
00:48:16,767 --> 00:48:19,067
Yes, please leave it there.

666
00:48:19,067 --> 00:48:21,367
Enjoy your meal.

667
00:48:25,333 --> 00:48:27,200
Ju Yeon!

668
00:48:32,133 --> 00:48:33,867
What's going on?

669
00:48:33,867 --> 00:48:36,600
You look so beautiful today.

670
00:48:38,100 --> 00:48:42,133
I was so busy that day that it slipped my mind.

671
00:48:42,133 --> 00:48:45,533
It slipped? Slipped?

672
00:48:46,367 --> 00:48:49,100
 Are you lying every time you open your mouth? 

673
00:48:49,700 --> 00:48:51,967
Ju Yeon.

674
00:48:51,967 --> 00:48:53,800
- Yes? 
 - The food will get cold.

675
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:57,733
I'm treating you today because I feel bad. So eat up now.

676
00:48:59,867 --> 00:49:02,933
 Why? Does your girlfriend want to leave work early again? 

677
00:49:02,933 --> 00:49:05,300
 Was it nice to take advantage of me? 

678
00:49:05,300 --> 00:49:06,967
I heard the steaks are really good here.

679
00:49:06,967 --> 00:49:08,233
I'll cut it for you.

680
00:49:08,233 --> 00:49:12,567
I'm so preoccupied with the subject right now.

681
00:49:13,700 --> 00:49:15,833
Well…

682
00:49:15,833 --> 00:49:18,500
Speaking of the subject,

683
00:49:18,500 --> 00:49:20,100
if he gets outpatient treatment,

684
00:49:20,100 --> 00:49:23,300
it'd be hard to conduct the follow-up behavior analysis.

685
00:49:23,300 --> 00:49:27,167
So, I want to change the topic to neurosurgery.

686
00:49:27,167 --> 00:49:30,533
It's just that they say this research could be suspended otherwise,

687
00:49:30,533 --> 00:49:33,300
so I'm trying my best to save the research, you know?

688
00:49:33,300 --> 00:49:37,330
I'm not coveting to be the lead author or anything.

689
00:49:37,867 --> 00:49:40,867
You wanted to commercialize this research at all costs.

690
00:49:40,867 --> 00:49:43,633
It's just about to see the light. We can't let it get buried. Right?

691
00:49:43,633 --> 00:49:45,767
That's what's best for the research

692
00:49:45,767 --> 00:49:48,267
as well as the subject.

693
00:49:55,733 --> 00:49:58,600
Are you thirsty?

694
00:49:58,600 --> 00:50:01,300
Can we get some more water here, please?

695
00:50:01,867 --> 00:50:04,267
You don't have to give me an answer right now.

696
00:50:04,267 --> 00:50:06,233
Just think about it.

697
00:50:06,233 --> 00:50:07,300
Because

698
00:50:07,300 --> 00:50:12,500
that's the only way we can continue with this research.

699
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:01,900
What's the occasion

700
00:51:01,900 --> 00:51:05,900
that I get to see my daughter's face in the bright daylight?

701
00:51:05,900 --> 00:51:10,133
Has the gate always been that color?

702
00:51:10,133 --> 00:51:15,033
I guess it looks unfamiliar because I've never looked at it closely in broad daylight.

703
00:51:15,667 --> 00:51:17,467
Pretty aunt!

704
00:51:17,467 --> 00:51:21,100
Hi, Seung Hyun.

705
00:51:24,567 --> 00:51:29,833
Seung Hyun, can you make this ordinary-looking aunt feel better, too?

706
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:32,600
Healing.

707
00:51:32,600 --> 00:51:34,933
You're grossing me out. Get off.

708
00:51:34,933 --> 00:51:36,800
I almost called you because I was so curious for the past few days.

709
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:37,967
So how did it go?

710
00:51:37,967 --> 00:51:40,733
Did you give my gift to your boyfriend?

711
00:51:43,133 --> 00:51:44,133
Boyfriend?

712
00:51:44,133 --> 00:51:46,433
Hey, do you have a boyfriend?

713
00:51:46,433 --> 00:51:48,767
No, I don't. None whatsoever.

714
00:51:48,767 --> 00:51:51,067
She does.

715
00:51:51,067 --> 00:51:52,700
Aunt.

716
00:51:52,700 --> 00:51:55,333
Are you getting married?

717
00:51:55,333 --> 00:51:57,767
Oh, no. Seung Hyun.

718
00:51:57,767 --> 00:52:02,600
I'm going to live with my cute little Seung Hyun forever.

719
00:52:03,467 --> 00:52:07,167
Don't tell unnecessary things to the child. Okay?

720
00:52:08,967 --> 00:52:11,300
It hurts.

721
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:13,467
 Promise me. 

722
00:52:13,467 --> 00:52:17,233
 No matter what happens, don't get shocked or cry. 

723
00:52:17,233 --> 00:52:20,400
 I'm afraid that if you get hurt, I'll get hurt too. 

724
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:22,533
 What are you doing? 

725
00:52:22,533 --> 00:52:24,633
 Get your hands off her. 

726
00:52:36,410 --> 00:52:39,800
   

727
00:53:10,533 --> 00:53:12,767
Senior, I came by to hand over the materials.

728
00:53:12,767 --> 00:53:17,000
I can't reach you. Are you in surgery? I'll come to the neurosurgery department.

729
00:53:57,500 --> 00:54:00,667
   

730
00:54:15,600 --> 00:54:19,233
Ju Yeon, the thing is…

731
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:24,033
What did you do to him under general anesthesia?

732
00:54:24,033 --> 00:54:26,100
What did you do to the subject?

733
00:54:26,100 --> 00:54:29,633
I just conducted a few tests from the neurosurgical perspective.

734
00:54:29,633 --> 00:54:33,767
You were already working on a research topic even before the subject was discharged.

735
00:54:33,767 --> 00:54:34,967
Does the subject know about this, too?

736
00:54:34,967 --> 00:54:36,533
Well…

737
00:54:36,533 --> 00:54:40,300
I used general anesthesia since it'd be hard to explain if the subject knew.

738
00:54:40,300 --> 00:54:42,800
 I should have been on his side. 

739
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:44,900
 I should have protected him. 

740
00:54:44,900 --> 00:54:48,200
Ju Yeon, let's think objectively. Okay?

741
00:54:50,233 --> 00:54:53,400
Ju Yeon, can't you get mad a bit more gracefully?

742
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:55,533
Gracefully?

743
00:54:56,233 --> 00:54:58,900
Yes, it's good to be graceful.

744
00:55:01,850 --> 00:55:09,200
♫  Running, running backwards to you  ♫

745
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:10,200
Hey!

746
00:55:10,200 --> 00:55:15,067
What can the psychiatry department do when the subject is discharged already?

747
00:55:24,900 --> 00:55:28,933
I can finally smell the scent of metal.

748
00:55:36,533 --> 00:55:38,700
- Hello. 
 - Hello.

749
00:55:38,700 --> 00:55:39,700
You're Ms. Jeon Sae Yan, right?

750
00:55:39,700 --> 00:55:41,567
- Yes, I am. 
 - Here you go.

751
00:55:41,567 --> 00:55:44,467
- Thank you. 
 - Thank you!

752
00:55:45,567 --> 00:55:47,700
What's this?

753
00:55:53,067 --> 00:55:55,700
 You weren't bluffing, Jeon Fling. 

754
00:55:55,700 --> 00:55:58,433
Who is Jeon Fling?

755
00:55:58,967 --> 00:56:01,333
My bracelet!

756
00:56:11,767 --> 00:56:14,400
 All good. 

757
00:56:21,900 --> 00:56:24,633
 Hey, you! 

758
00:56:24,633 --> 00:56:27,000
 You! 

759
00:56:31,500 --> 00:56:33,500
 Hey! 

760
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:43,733
 I thought it was a stalker. 

761
00:56:53,500 --> 00:56:56,633
 You're dumping me? 

762
00:57:20,067 --> 00:57:24,333
   

763
00:57:24,333 --> 00:57:27,433
This was the day of the accident.

764
00:57:28,900 --> 00:57:31,633
Did I go to this?

765
00:57:50,150 --> 00:57:52,230
 ­  

766
00:58:05,800 --> 00:58:06,833
 How about it? 

767
00:58:06,833 --> 00:58:09,000
 We're getting back together. Okay? 

768
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:10,167
 What, what, what? 

769
00:58:10,167 --> 00:58:12,833
 And now! 

770
00:58:12,833 --> 00:58:15,100
 Let's break up! 

771
00:58:15,100 --> 00:58:16,933
 See? 

772
00:58:16,933 --> 00:58:19,267
 I'm the one who dumped you. 

773
00:58:19,267 --> 00:58:21,467
 You little… 

774
00:58:23,533 --> 00:58:25,700
 Please spare me. 

775
00:58:27,933 --> 00:58:32,067
It didn't break like I thought. It just came undone.

776
00:58:33,067 --> 00:58:35,800
I should make a wish again.

777
00:58:38,767 --> 00:58:42,833
Please help me find him.

778
00:59:18,133 --> 00:59:20,800
Don't be so surprised.

779
00:59:21,500 --> 00:59:25,067
Here. I've come after seeing this.

780
00:59:25,067 --> 00:59:26,933
Could you please step aside?

781
00:59:26,933 --> 00:59:30,233
Gosh, it's cold. It's so cold.

782
00:59:30,233 --> 00:59:32,100
Gosh, it's so cold.

783
00:59:32,100 --> 00:59:35,700
Is there anything like a towel to dry myself with?

784
00:59:35,700 --> 00:59:38,400
I got out of the taxi and it was raining so hard.

785
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:41,733
I've got this huge suitcase and my phone battery was dead too.

786
00:59:44,500 --> 00:59:46,567
Did you know that the lobby floor of your building is made of marble?

787
00:59:46,567 --> 00:59:50,067
I almost slipped and fell totally flat on my face.

788
00:59:51,300 --> 00:59:53,100
This floor is marble, too.

789
00:59:53,100 --> 00:59:56,467
Be careful. If you twist your back, it won't heal easily.

790
01:00:02,867 --> 01:00:05,300
Is that all you have to say?

791
01:00:05,300 --> 01:00:08,133
I don't need any insurance benefits. Just providing room and board will do.

792
01:00:08,133 --> 01:00:10,300
Where is my room?

793
01:00:13,067 --> 01:00:16,333
I've come here as the team doctor.

794
01:00:20,750 --> 01:00:28,330


795
01:00:31,933 --> 01:00:36,500
♫  So high  ♫

796
01:00:36,500 --> 01:00:39,767
♫  Look at me, look at me, look at me  ♫

797
01:00:39,767 --> 01:00:44,333
♫  So high  ♫

798
01:00:44,333 --> 01:00:48,560
♫  Look at me, look at me, look at you  ♫

799
01:00:48,560 --> 01:00:53,530
♫  Only to me  ♫ 
 ♫  Can you please come to me?  ♫

800
01:00:53,530 --> 01:00:58,900
   

801
01:00:58,900 --> 01:01:00,100
 Please leave. 

802
01:01:00,100 --> 01:01:01,533
 If I lose the bet, I'll leave. 

803
01:01:01,533 --> 01:01:03,333
 Let's have the player decide. 

804
01:01:03,333 --> 01:01:04,267
 I don't have time. 

805
01:01:04,267 --> 01:01:06,067
 Unless we talk while doing the rehabilitation together. 

806
01:01:06,067 --> 01:01:08,067
 Ms. Cha Si On! You didn't leave, did you? 

807
01:01:08,067 --> 01:01:09,867
 Was I just at home the day I had the accident? 

808
01:01:09,867 --> 01:01:11,033
 Yes. Why do you ask? 

809
01:01:11,033 --> 01:01:13,267
 I wonder why she's lying to me. 

810
01:01:13,267 --> 01:01:15,100
 Why is there a dog here? 

811
01:01:15,100 --> 01:01:16,100
 Bark. Woof, woof! 

812
01:01:16,100 --> 01:01:18,267
 I see. This is why you don't drink much. 

813
01:01:18,267 --> 01:01:20,033
 What's the reason that you're going this far? 

814
01:01:20,033 --> 01:01:23,600
 To protect the subject, I've got to be more ruthless. 

815
01:01:23,600 --> 01:01:26,200
 If there are no flaws, you have to make them.
