2
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:14,680
 ­  

3
00:00:16,130 --> 00:00:18,340
   

4
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:23,060
   

5
00:00:25,433 --> 00:00:33,400
   

6
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:40,367
   

7
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:59,580


8
00:01:12,733 --> 00:01:16,167
Honey.

9
00:01:16,167 --> 00:01:18,233
Honey, wake up.

10
00:01:18,233 --> 00:01:21,167
Why? Did I do something wrong again?

11
00:01:21,167 --> 00:01:25,200
There's a noise outside.

12
00:01:26,333 --> 00:01:27,867
Is it a thief?

13
00:01:27,867 --> 00:01:29,833
Go and check it out.

14
00:01:29,833 --> 00:01:31,933
- Me? 
 - You worked out.

15
00:01:31,933 --> 00:01:34,267
I have a bad heart.

16
00:01:34,267 --> 00:01:36,967
Okay, don't worry.

17
00:01:36,967 --> 00:01:40,333
Just trust me.

18
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,990
- What are you doing? 
 - Shh!

19
00:02:17,333 --> 00:02:20,133
Lee Shin!

20
00:02:20,133 --> 00:02:21,233
Shin.

21
00:02:21,233 --> 00:02:24,233
Dad.

22
00:02:24,233 --> 00:02:27,333
You bastard.

23
00:02:27,333 --> 00:02:29,067
You came back well.

24
00:02:29,067 --> 00:02:31,800
Oh my.

25
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,533
Hey, what's this smell?

26
00:02:33,533 --> 00:02:37,500
Did you happen to work on a deep-sea fishing boat?

27
00:02:40,867 --> 00:02:44,080
Is it because I went fishing?

28
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,633
Seems like you had a great time all by yourself

29
00:02:46,633 --> 00:02:50,167
without even thinking about your family worrying.

30
00:02:50,167 --> 00:02:52,800
Yeah, you came back well.

31
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,133
It's all good if you came back healthy.

32
00:02:54,133 --> 00:02:57,210
Ah, by the way, where's Kun?

33
00:03:05,333 --> 00:03:07,000
You are tired. Right?

34
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,467
Go back.

35
00:03:09,467 --> 00:03:12,260
We've already walked around the neighborhood twice.

36
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:19,200
Why is this neighborhood so small?

37
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,967
This time again…

38
00:03:21,967 --> 00:03:25,400
Well… That…

39
00:03:27,333 --> 00:03:30,340
- That… 
 - Do you have something to say?

40
00:03:35,167 --> 00:03:36,200
I mean…

41
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:40,400
Let's have a peck.

42
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,367
All of a sudden?

43
00:03:42,367 --> 00:03:45,967
Oh my… Don't you know?

44
00:03:45,967 --> 00:03:49,667
"When Daddy goes to work, kiss, kiss, kiss."

45
00:03:49,667 --> 00:03:54,367
"Bye you, see you again, kiss, kiss, kiss." Don't you know this song?

46
00:03:54,367 --> 00:03:57,040
So, I mean we…

47
00:03:58,767 --> 00:04:02,200
Let's meet again.

48
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,867
Oh my.

49
00:04:03,867 --> 00:04:05,800
The ringing is going to wake everyone up.

50
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:08,367
Go back home.

51
00:04:08,367 --> 00:04:11,600
Ringing? What do you mean?

52
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:14,267
Ah, that's it!

53
00:04:14,267 --> 00:04:19,600
The chime that you hear when kissing someone you like?

54
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:23,467
Is it a hallucination filled with earnest longing?

55
00:04:23,467 --> 00:04:26,900
Our lips didn't even touch.

56
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:29,867
You're even hearing hallucinations now.

57
00:04:29,867 --> 00:04:34,240
Wow, you must really love me.

58
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,900
Go in. I'll be on my way.

59
00:04:41,333 --> 00:04:43,233
I'm really leaving.

60
00:04:43,233 --> 00:04:44,933
Yes.

61
00:04:44,933 --> 00:04:46,800
Take care…

62
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,260
Be careful.

63
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,780
I'm going.

64
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,350
Don't cry because you'll miss me again.

65
00:05:07,533 --> 00:05:09,630
I'll be on my way.

66
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:31,867
I didn't sleep. I waited.

67
00:05:31,867 --> 00:05:34,533
You could have gone to sleep first.

68
00:05:34,533 --> 00:05:36,900
The bell ringing woke you up. Right?

69
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:38,633
The bell?

70
00:05:38,633 --> 00:05:43,420
You said you had something to tell me, right? So I've been waiting.

71
00:05:45,433 --> 00:05:47,500
It's late, right?

72
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:50,333
I found Player Lee Shin and brought him back with me.

73
00:05:50,333 --> 00:05:51,933
I have something to deal with.

74
00:05:51,933 --> 00:05:53,633
Did you find Lee Shin?

75
00:05:53,633 --> 00:05:59,130
He's not some teenager anymore. Why did he even run away?

76
00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:01,470
How are you feeling now?

77
00:06:02,567 --> 00:06:07,033
Seung Hyun put this on me to encourage me.

78
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:10,700
I went to the market with your mother during the day.

79
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:14,133
Spicy chicken feet go best with makgeolli.

80
00:06:14,133 --> 00:06:16,933
I sipped makgeolli too much.

81
00:06:16,933 --> 00:06:20,100
I was about to come home holding Seung Hyun's hand.

82
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:22,367
But then I realized, it wasn't Seung Hyun.

83
00:06:22,367 --> 00:06:27,260
So I ended up helping to find his mother.

84
00:06:28,167 --> 00:06:32,000
I'm glad it seems your mood have improved.

85
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,800
The people in this house feel a hundred,

86
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:40,000
even a thousand times more like family than my own mom.

87
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:45,900
Tomorrow, I should go to the Athletes' Village and say goodbye.

88
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:48,860
So what were you about to say?

89
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,867
Sae Yan,

90
00:06:56,867 --> 00:06:59,970
don't be startled and listen well.

91
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,367
You know.

92
00:07:01,367 --> 00:07:03,767
Why are your hands so cold? They're like ice blocks.

93
00:07:03,767 --> 00:07:05,933
Put them in. It's warm in here.

94
00:07:05,933 --> 00:07:07,633
Come here.

95
00:07:07,633 --> 00:07:10,590
Then just a moment.

96
00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:13,990
Yeah, come lie down.

97
00:07:21,533 --> 00:07:24,900
Even knowing this truth, I felt heavy-hearted

98
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:28,450
because I couldn't bring myself to say it.

99
00:07:28,450 --> 00:07:32,480
But now, I think I really have to talk about it.

100
00:07:35,433 --> 00:07:38,400
Before I tell you, I have a favor to ask.

101
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,700
I don't know how his brain will react.

102
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:44,790
So I want you to keep it a secret for the time being.

103
00:07:46,467 --> 00:07:49,790
It's about Mr. Lee's first love.

104
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:19,367
   

105
00:08:19,367 --> 00:08:21,700
He's coming out.

106
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:23,467
How are you feeling right now?

107
00:08:23,467 --> 00:08:25,400
- When do you plan to return? 
 - I'm sorry.

108
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,833
May I ask you for a word?

109
00:08:26,833 --> 00:08:28,500
- I'm sorry. 
 - I'm sorry.

110
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:31,870
Please say a word.

111
00:08:32,830 --> 00:08:34,867
Like the official statement,

112
00:08:34,867 --> 00:08:39,100
Player Lee Shin has submitted video evidence proving that there are no charges against him.

113
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:43,076
Regardless of the reason, we deeply regret causing social unrest.

114
00:08:43,076 --> 00:08:44,200
Moving forward, Player Lee Shin will…

115
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:49,233
 Sports player Lee Shin was cleared of attempted murder charges this morning. 

116
00:08:49,233 --> 00:08:54,500
 On the 22nd, a post by an anonymous tipster on a social media platform quickly spread, 

117
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,800
 leading to Lee Shin, who faced attempted murder charges, 

118
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:00,233
 turning himself into the police after ten days on the run. 

119
00:09:00,233 --> 00:09:02,333
 According to the investigation, 

120
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:05,067
 the lead officer confirmed that while there was a minor dispute between the siblings, 

121
00:09:05,067 --> 00:09:07,300
 it was not an attempted murder. 

122
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:09,367
 Additionally, Player Lee Shin's agency 

123
00:09:09,367 --> 00:09:14,133
 has announced that they plan to file a lawsuit against the anonymous tipster 

124
00:09:14,133 --> 00:09:19,400
 who posted the text and photos on social media, considering it malicious behavior… 

125
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,933
CEO Hong, where are you going?

126
00:09:21,933 --> 00:09:23,333
The outfit stands out too much.

127
00:09:23,333 --> 00:09:26,667
I'm the CEO of Shin's agency, after all.

128
00:09:26,667 --> 00:09:28,600
And since I have the ability, I managed to handle it at this level.

129
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,100
If it were another agency,

130
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:35,233
Shin's return would be nothing more than a dream.

131
00:09:35,233 --> 00:09:38,800
All right, then shall we start heading to the Athletes' Village now?

132
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:42,167
Okay, change your clothes and come back down. I'll be waiting.

133
00:09:42,167 --> 00:09:44,320
I'm not going.

134
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:48,833
I'm planning to take a break for a while.

135
00:09:48,833 --> 00:09:51,267
What? Take a break?

136
00:09:51,267 --> 00:09:52,433
All of a sudden?

137
00:09:52,433 --> 00:09:54,533
What did you say?

138
00:09:54,533 --> 00:09:57,567
After disappearing without a word and then showing up,

139
00:09:57,567 --> 00:10:00,790
the only thing you say is that you're going to take a break from exercising?

140
00:10:01,833 --> 00:10:06,667
Not for long. I'll take a break for about a year.

141
00:10:06,667 --> 00:10:08,467
One year?

142
00:10:08,467 --> 00:10:11,167
You mean…

143
00:10:11,167 --> 00:10:13,733
Do you know how much has been invested?

144
00:10:13,733 --> 00:10:17,867
Do you know at what age tennis players retire?

145
00:10:17,867 --> 00:10:22,033
At most, in a few years, you would naturally retire and rest for the rest of your life.

146
00:10:22,033 --> 00:10:24,500
Even with exercise, timing is everything.

147
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:27,467
Even if you double your workout, it wouldn't be enough.

148
00:10:27,467 --> 00:10:30,867
And you want to take a year off at twenty-seven?

149
00:10:30,867 --> 00:10:33,933
Because I'm twenty-seven.

150
00:10:33,933 --> 00:10:35,533
Because I'm an adult now.

151
00:10:35,533 --> 00:10:38,600
For the first time, I want to live the way I want to live.

152
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:41,133
Whether being a tennis player is really what I want to do,

153
00:10:41,133 --> 00:10:43,770
or if I'm just doing it because someone told me to.

154
00:10:45,067 --> 00:10:47,433
I also want to reflect on my feelings.

155
00:10:47,433 --> 00:10:48,867
You were forced to do it?

156
00:10:48,867 --> 00:10:53,333
Are you saying that you've been doing it unwillingly because we forced you?

157
00:10:53,333 --> 00:10:54,867
Shin,

158
00:10:54,867 --> 00:10:57,500
do you know how much your mother has sacrificed for you?

159
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:03,330
Your mother would feel very hurt if you talk like that.

160
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:04,900
Of course. Yes.

161
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:07,533
It's not okay.

162
00:11:07,533 --> 00:11:10,400
What do you mean, take a break?

163
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:12,567
I'm sorry.

164
00:11:12,567 --> 00:11:15,067
This is not a discussion, but a notification.

165
00:11:15,067 --> 00:11:17,867
It's my life, so I'll take responsibility.

166
00:11:17,867 --> 00:11:19,900
I'll take care of the aftermath as well.

167
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:21,967
Through my lawyer,

168
00:11:21,967 --> 00:11:25,520
I will contact you after carefully reviewing the contract details.

169
00:11:29,733 --> 00:11:32,390
Sh-Shin.

170
00:11:33,733 --> 00:11:35,960
Cola.

171
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,433
Cola.

172
00:11:39,433 --> 00:11:41,170
Cola.

173
00:11:41,933 --> 00:11:44,733
He's not here.

174
00:11:44,733 --> 00:11:47,020
I'm here.

175
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:55,870
What are you doing?

176
00:11:58,567 --> 00:12:01,133
The dog house is sturdy.

177
00:12:01,133 --> 00:12:04,667
Sounds don't carry well from it.

178
00:12:04,667 --> 00:12:08,060
They make good dog houses these days.

179
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,700
Looks good, huh?

180
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:13,533
Looks good? What are you talking about?

181
00:12:13,533 --> 00:12:15,920
Is it Ju Yeon's magic?

182
00:12:17,033 --> 00:12:20,967
Ju Yeon is great in every way, but she has no eye for men.

183
00:12:20,967 --> 00:12:24,350
I can't believe she likes you more than me.

184
00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:25,933
That's exactly what I'm saying.

185
00:12:25,933 --> 00:12:29,640
I haven't even shown 1% of my charm.

186
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,433
Brother, that…

187
00:12:39,433 --> 00:12:40,800
that Han River incident.

188
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:43,433
Ugh, forget it.

189
00:12:43,433 --> 00:12:46,710
It's fine as long as you came back.

190
00:12:54,567 --> 00:12:57,467
Do you want to chew some gum?

191
00:12:57,467 --> 00:13:01,100
   

192
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:06,350
No, I'll chew this one.

193
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,700
   

194
00:13:13,867 --> 00:13:17,400
Oh my, Cola.

195
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:19,767
Looks like Cola prefers you over me now.

196
00:13:19,767 --> 00:13:23,010
Seeing it just trailing after you.

197
00:13:26,333 --> 00:13:30,300
Ugh, Cola. He's so annoying, you just…

198
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:32,840
just live with him.

199
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:37,760
Cola,

200
00:13:37,767 --> 00:13:42,167
now that I'm resting, so let's hang out every day. Okay?

201
00:13:42,167 --> 00:13:46,220
Let's go for walks and hang out every day.

202
00:13:47,267 --> 00:13:49,100
Try your best.

203
00:13:50,033 --> 00:13:51,600
No.

204
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:56,420
Seeing you say you're taking a break, isn't that a sign of determination?

205
00:13:57,267 --> 00:14:01,740
Live your life well.

206
00:14:07,967 --> 00:14:10,267
Oh, right.

207
00:14:10,267 --> 00:14:12,370
My phone.

208
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:17,540
Don't you have my phone?

209
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:53,200
Everyone is practicing with their partners.

210
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:56,667
Why am I the only one with you?

211
00:14:56,667 --> 00:15:00,367
At least pretend to be working hard.

212
00:15:00,367 --> 00:15:03,767
Before both of us get kicked out for no reason.

213
00:15:03,767 --> 00:15:05,900
Waist exercise.

214
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:07,733
Lee Shin has terrible manners!

215
00:15:07,733 --> 00:15:11,100
Like the phone drops on your face when you're lying down and using it.

216
00:15:12,567 --> 00:15:16,767
Like pouring cold water into a cup of ramyeon.

217
00:15:16,767 --> 00:15:19,520
Like eating a tangerine after brushing your teeth.

218
00:15:20,767 --> 00:15:23,950
Warm up and wait for me.

219
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,300
Hey, Cha Si On.

220
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:32,700
If Lee Shin is involved in an attempted murder, it's a sure thing he'll be a washed-up athlete.

221
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:34,133
Can't you read the text?

222
00:15:34,133 --> 00:15:36,000
The news said he was cleared of all charges.

223
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,367
So what?

224
00:15:37,367 --> 00:15:40,967
Honestly, he was cool because there wasn't a single scandal.

225
00:15:40,967 --> 00:15:44,800
His image is totally ruined.

226
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,900
So what?

227
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:50,067
You're an attention-seeker who wants to create a scandal but can't. Right?

228
00:15:50,067 --> 00:15:51,100
Because you're a nobody.

229
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:52,867
Do you want to die?

230
00:15:52,867 --> 00:15:55,733
Hey, why are you even exercising? You're going to be kicked out anyway.

231
00:15:55,733 --> 00:15:56,833
You!

232
00:15:56,833 --> 00:15:59,000
You ignorant girl!

233
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,933
What did you say? You know I'm strong. Right?

234
00:16:01,933 --> 00:16:04,467
Try to feel just how strong I am!

235
00:16:04,467 --> 00:16:07,467
Hey!

236
00:16:10,633 --> 00:16:12,067
Hey, what's wrong?

237
00:16:12,067 --> 00:16:13,533
There are a lot of people watching.

238
00:16:13,533 --> 00:16:18,200
That bitch is bad-mouthing Lee Shin.

239
00:16:20,833 --> 00:16:24,333
Hey, aren't you coming over here?

240
00:16:30,333 --> 00:16:33,800
It's really unfair.

241
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:36,600
She started the trouble first.

242
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:39,433
Why am I the only one being told to leave the Athletes' Village?

243
00:16:39,433 --> 00:16:43,400
You were kicked out of the Athletes' Village, but she probably ended up with a broken rib.

244
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:44,833
It's a good thing we reached an agreement.

245
00:16:44,833 --> 00:16:46,700
Let's assume she hit her first.

246
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:49,200
Then what about me?

247
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:52,367
If our player is getting hit, do I just stand by and watch?

248
00:16:52,367 --> 00:16:54,467
Like a man, just…

249
00:16:54,467 --> 00:16:58,520
I heard that she took off your pants. It's a good thing you were wearing long johns.

250
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,800
Whose side are you on now?

251
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:03,233
Do you think everyone will just stay quiet?

252
00:17:03,233 --> 00:17:04,433
Mr. Lee.

253
00:17:04,433 --> 00:17:07,467
Oh? Ms. Sae Yan.

254
00:17:07,467 --> 00:17:09,667
So you came to pick her up because Si On got kicked out.

255
00:17:09,667 --> 00:17:13,167
Who got kicked out?

256
00:17:14,467 --> 00:17:17,200
You're right.

257
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,567
I'm unemployed now too.

258
00:17:18,567 --> 00:17:20,700
I quit my job too.

259
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:22,333
Let's all go together.

260
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:25,200
Ms. Sae Yan.

261
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,500
I'll carry your luggage for you. Please give it to me.

262
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:27,967
Thank you.

263
00:17:27,967 --> 00:17:32,167
The table is just like a jungle.

264
00:17:32,167 --> 00:17:34,740
An anaconda could come out.

265
00:17:38,767 --> 00:17:40,650
What is it?

266
00:17:45,233 --> 00:17:48,167
I'm trying to eat what I want while taking a break.

267
00:17:48,167 --> 00:17:51,233
You two haven't tried something like this, either.

268
00:17:51,233 --> 00:17:53,300
After eating only vegetables all the time…

269
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:54,933
It's delivery food.

270
00:17:54,933 --> 00:17:56,267
Wow, this smell.

271
00:17:56,267 --> 00:17:58,470
Honey.

272
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,067
- Ah, yes? 
 - Please ask him

273
00:18:01,067 --> 00:18:03,933
how long it's going to take for him to recover

274
00:18:03,933 --> 00:18:06,967
and ask him if he wants to spend his whole life resting.

275
00:18:06,967 --> 00:18:10,733
He must have heard it all…

276
00:18:10,733 --> 00:18:12,400
Shin,

277
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:16,100
you need to eat chicken breast and vegetables and build up your muscles.

278
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:19,067
Give that to me.

279
00:18:19,067 --> 00:18:22,133
You two should take a vacation.

280
00:18:22,133 --> 00:18:25,300
You've been looking after me all your life.

281
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:26,800
What is he saying?

282
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:30,067
He's pretending to care about us so much.

283
00:18:30,067 --> 00:18:32,600
He's so immature.

284
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:37,430
I can't believe a national athlete representing the country would say something irresponsible.

285
00:18:39,267 --> 00:18:40,933
Honey.

286
00:18:40,933 --> 00:18:42,233
Yes?

287
00:18:42,233 --> 00:18:46,700
Please tell him that he can rest later, after his retirement.

288
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:49,833
I'm not a messenger, but why do you keep asking me to relay messages to him?

289
00:18:49,833 --> 00:18:51,067
Shin,

290
00:18:51,067 --> 00:18:54,567
are you going to eat this kind of delivery food even when you get older, huh?

291
00:18:54,567 --> 00:18:56,533
You have to earn well while you're young.

292
00:18:56,533 --> 00:18:58,100
Give this to me.

293
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:00,310
Honey!

294
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,967
Eat up.

295
00:19:03,967 --> 00:19:06,000
I'll go up then.

296
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,467
Hey, Shin, it's just a saying. Come here, eat up, and then go up.

297
00:19:10,467 --> 00:19:11,867
   

298
00:19:11,867 --> 00:19:16,133
Now, the reason I've called an emergency meeting today is

299
00:19:16,133 --> 00:19:21,320
I have succeeded in the reset experiment with the mouse 109.

300
00:19:22,033 --> 00:19:24,467
Reset?

301
00:19:24,467 --> 00:19:29,467
That… I've decided to hand over the directorship to Te Oh.

302
00:19:29,467 --> 00:19:33,240
I hope everyone will follow Te Oh's words.

303
00:19:34,233 --> 00:19:36,800
That's not right, Professor Han.

304
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:39,167
Dr. Te Oh,

305
00:19:39,167 --> 00:19:42,467
how about giving it a bit more time?

306
00:19:42,467 --> 00:19:45,400
Three days is too tight.

307
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:47,467
I won't say it twice.

308
00:19:47,467 --> 00:19:50,340
It is in three days.

309
00:19:56,667 --> 00:20:01,960
Dr. Kim, there's no time. I'll go now.

310
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:05,767
What did Dr. Kim say?

311
00:20:05,767 --> 00:20:07,233
What are the test results?

312
00:20:07,233 --> 00:20:11,133
Did he say the memory recognition errorhas been restored to its original state?

313
00:20:11,133 --> 00:20:14,367
He said he was just observing the test subject's progress.

314
00:20:14,367 --> 00:20:18,180
I bought some time by pretending to cooperate.

315
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:24,167
Still, we are running out of time.

316
00:20:24,167 --> 00:20:29,667
How about just telling the Minister everything honestly?

317
00:20:29,667 --> 00:20:33,900
At least the Minister will stop the reset experiment. Right?

318
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:38,867
He might stop not only the reset experiment but also the experiments to eliminate side effects.

319
00:20:38,867 --> 00:20:43,167
If that happens, the side effects could be irreversible forever.

320
00:20:43,167 --> 00:20:45,967
We have to succeed in the experiment even one day earlier than Te Oh.

321
00:20:45,967 --> 00:20:50,170
That way, we can also naturally prevent a reset.

322
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:54,580
So how can that be done in three days?

323
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:57,567
Te Oh, that punk.

324
00:20:57,567 --> 00:21:01,533
Professor Han, please buy as much time as possible next to Te Oh.

325
00:21:01,533 --> 00:21:05,750
Alongside Dr. Kim, I will try somehow to prevent the side effects.

326
00:21:13,933 --> 00:21:15,600
Elsa is better after all!

327
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:18,367
Didn't Te Oh embezzle research funds last time?

328
00:21:18,367 --> 00:21:20,333
I don't know.

329
00:21:20,333 --> 00:21:26,633
How do you not know? Everyone in this hospital knows that you two are dating.

330
00:21:26,633 --> 00:21:29,933
Dr. Kyeong.

331
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,033
Dr. Kyeong, did you know?

332
00:21:33,033 --> 00:21:37,633
Are you really handing over the research center to Dr. Te Oh?

333
00:21:37,633 --> 00:21:41,667
For the time being, please pay attention to the management of the mice in the aseptic room.

334
00:21:41,667 --> 00:21:45,000
It's right after the reset experiment on mouse 109, so we need to be prepared for eventuality.

335
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:49,267
Are you just going to stand by and watch Dr. Te Oh become the head of the center?

336
00:21:49,267 --> 00:21:51,120
   

337
00:21:56,033 --> 00:21:57,900
 Was it the year 1994? 

338
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:00,400
 When selling sweet potatoes at Morin Market, 

339
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:05,400
 I met Ms. So Jeong, who was selling fish-shaped buns. 

340
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:10,133
 Back then, our affection was so special that it made the local newspapers. 

341
00:22:10,133 --> 00:22:12,700
 Could it be that we weren't meant to be? 

342
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:16,560
 Now that we each have our own families. 

343
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:21,567
Did something come up?

344
00:22:21,567 --> 00:22:23,530
No.

345
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:31,867
Why did you put that on like the kids do?

346
00:22:31,867 --> 00:22:33,233
Oh, this?

347
00:22:33,233 --> 00:22:35,033
This is my lucky charm.

348
00:22:35,033 --> 00:22:37,100
It's a transfer tattoo.

349
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:39,067
A transfer tattoo?

350
00:22:39,067 --> 00:22:41,200
You don't know what a transfer tattoo is?

351
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:43,667
After sticking the paper like this,

352
00:22:43,667 --> 00:22:48,000
you wet it with your saliva and slap it onto your hand!

353
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,100
What is that? You put that on with your saliva?

354
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:51,640
Like this.

355
00:22:56,810 --> 00:22:58,860
 Here! 

356
00:23:04,067 --> 00:23:05,770
Saliva.

357
00:23:08,067 --> 00:23:09,200
Yes, Lieutenant.

358
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:11,667
I think I might be able to find the blackmailer.

359
00:23:11,667 --> 00:23:13,567
The envelope that contained the photos

360
00:23:13,567 --> 00:23:15,633
was a wet adhesive envelope,

361
00:23:15,633 --> 00:23:19,967
so it's possible it was sealed with saliva.

362
00:23:19,967 --> 00:23:21,367
Yes.

363
00:23:21,367 --> 00:23:26,533
I'll send the envelope by courier, and please test the DNA.

364
00:23:26,533 --> 00:23:28,020
Yes.

365
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:37,600
   
   

366
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:39,180
   ­

367
00:23:43,167 --> 00:23:46,633
Oh, this is my mom.

368
00:23:46,633 --> 00:23:48,380
If so…

369
00:23:52,367 --> 00:23:55,400
Sae Yan, I'll leave first.

370
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:57,133
I found him.

371
00:23:57,133 --> 00:24:00,033
I think I found

372
00:24:00,033 --> 00:24:02,000
my dad.

373
00:24:07,533 --> 00:24:09,850
Thank you.

374
00:24:26,967 --> 00:24:29,833
This is what my dad looks like.

375
00:24:29,833 --> 00:24:34,340
Thanks to you, I now know my dad's face and name. I'm truly grateful.

376
00:24:35,267 --> 00:24:39,230
Because you paid the favor in full upfront.

377
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,860
That's a relief.

378
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:45,110
That's good to hear.

379
00:24:47,833 --> 00:24:49,400
Yes, I'll go now.

380
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:51,480
Ju Yeon.

381
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,267
Are you upset?

382
00:24:58,267 --> 00:24:59,500
You know me.

383
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:02,167
Would I be doing all this just for my own benefit?

384
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:04,700
Honestly, if the side effects are revealed,

385
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:06,867
you're at risk of being disciplined.

386
00:25:06,867 --> 00:25:11,400
If I reset it, it's a win-win for both of us.

387
00:25:12,567 --> 00:25:14,733
Even as you make excuses,

388
00:25:14,733 --> 00:25:17,033
you're not thinking about the subject at all.

389
00:25:17,033 --> 00:25:20,667
Subject?

390
00:25:20,667 --> 00:25:25,233
Since when have you cared so much for patients and test subjects?

391
00:25:25,233 --> 00:25:29,830
If you mess up, you could end up never being able to work in this field again.

392
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:36,267
Just protect the subject.

393
00:25:36,267 --> 00:25:40,690
I can't just watch him return to a hellish life.

394
00:25:42,567 --> 00:25:46,620
Others would think you're really his first love.

395
00:25:58,867 --> 00:26:00,233
Who do you think I am?

396
00:26:00,233 --> 00:26:02,300
The pretty aunt with a changed voice.

397
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:05,367
Look at this. Here's the warm bun you love.

398
00:26:05,367 --> 00:26:06,367
Pizza bun?

399
00:26:06,367 --> 00:26:09,333
There's a pizza bun, vegetable bun, and red bean bun. What do you want to eat?

400
00:26:09,333 --> 00:26:10,667
I'll have the pizza bun.

401
00:26:10,667 --> 00:26:14,600
Well, then the person who arrives first gets to choose first.

402
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:16,567
Let's start.

403
00:26:16,567 --> 00:26:19,833
Where does that rule come from?

404
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:27,300
- Mom. 
 - It's time for the flight.

405
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:29,340
Let's hurry up.

406
00:26:32,067 --> 00:26:33,833
No, I don't want to go back.

407
00:26:33,833 --> 00:26:35,967
I can't go. I will report to the police.

408
00:26:35,967 --> 00:26:37,767
Ma'am, could you please report to the police.

409
00:26:37,767 --> 00:26:39,850
Just go back.

410
00:26:41,467 --> 00:26:42,533
Ma'am.

411
00:26:42,533 --> 00:26:47,090
If I had known you ran away from the beginning, I wouldn't have taken you in.

412
00:26:47,933 --> 00:26:49,067
Ma'am.

413
00:26:49,067 --> 00:26:51,400
Ma'am, can't I stay a little longer?

414
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:54,133
The truth is, I'm looking for my biological father, and I'm almost there now.

415
00:26:54,133 --> 00:26:55,967
So, just a few more days…

416
00:26:55,967 --> 00:26:57,533
Please just leave.

417
00:26:57,533 --> 00:26:59,100
It's not just a day or two.

418
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:01,733
Do I have to take care of my friend's daughter as well?

419
00:27:01,733 --> 00:27:04,933
You're so clueless.

420
00:27:04,933 --> 00:27:07,533
Why are you looking for your father?

421
00:27:07,533 --> 00:27:11,367
Is being a dad just about giving birth? Just leave! It's really annoying.

422
00:27:11,367 --> 00:27:15,200
Then at least I want to say goodbye to Ju Yeon…

423
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:19,200
Ju Yeon knows too. Ju Yeon said you should leave.

424
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,200
What?

425
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:26,067
Grandma, don't take away the pretty auntie.

426
00:27:26,067 --> 00:27:28,680
Seung Hyun, come here.

427
00:27:30,267 --> 00:27:33,900
Grandma, don't kick out the pretty auntie.

428
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:38,600
I can eat a little and share my food with her.

429
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:41,267
I'll also do the cleaning.

430
00:27:41,267 --> 00:27:47,633
So, let's all live together: pretty auntie, Aunt Ju Yeon, and you, Grandma.

431
00:27:47,633 --> 00:27:50,200
Please.

432
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:54,133
Seung Hyun, if you don't listen to me, you'll get scolded. Okay?

433
00:27:54,133 --> 00:27:56,033
Are you going to get scolded today?

434
00:27:56,033 --> 00:27:59,400
I'll go… Don't scold Seung Hyun.

435
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:03,640
Pretty auntie, don't leave.

436
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:07,633
Seung Hyun, I'm sorry.

437
00:28:07,633 --> 00:28:11,070
But I'll come back. I promise.

438
00:28:19,067 --> 00:28:22,580
Thank you for everything so far.

439
00:28:26,467 --> 00:28:31,450
You also need to keep going to the hospital for your injured wrist.

440
00:29:12,867 --> 00:29:15,900
Why were you being a nuisance at someone else's house?

441
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:19,950
Ju Yeon can't even remember your childhood.

442
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:25,060
Once you get to Italy, stay put, and don't leave the house for a while.

443
00:29:35,267 --> 00:29:38,190
- Are you okay? 
 - Are you hurt anywhere?

444
00:29:43,033 --> 00:29:46,133
Oh my.

445
00:29:48,067 --> 00:29:49,600
Oh my.

446
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:51,167
Sae Yan!

447
00:29:51,167 --> 00:29:54,060
Please hold onto Sae Yan!

448
00:30:01,533 --> 00:30:04,460
Excuse me!

449
00:30:11,833 --> 00:30:13,800
Who are you?

450
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:34,330
 ­  

451
00:30:34,333 --> 00:30:38,210
Thank you! I ran away thanks to you.

452
00:30:39,233 --> 00:30:42,450
But do you by any chance know me?

453
00:31:00,167 --> 00:31:02,160
Sae Yan.

454
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:14,800
Da... Dad.

455
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:17,080
My daughter.

456
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:29,770
Are you really my dad?

457
00:31:30,767 --> 00:31:33,330
Are you truly my dad?

458
00:31:44,933 --> 00:31:50,233
Have I aged too much since then?

459
00:31:50,233 --> 00:31:52,133
No, you look the same.

460
00:31:52,133 --> 00:31:55,733
No, even if there were no photos, just…

461
00:31:55,733 --> 00:31:58,100
I can tell just by the look in your eyes

462
00:31:58,100 --> 00:32:00,867
that you're my father.

463
00:32:00,867 --> 00:32:02,950
Dad.

464
00:32:08,433 --> 00:32:11,320
I also recognized my daughter at first glance.

465
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:16,633
But how did you save me?

466
00:32:16,633 --> 00:32:18,290
What?

467
00:32:20,033 --> 00:32:24,033
When I went to the countryside house you lived in, the village chief told me.

468
00:32:24,033 --> 00:32:29,500
I came with the address and saw some men taking you away.

469
00:32:30,467 --> 00:32:35,433
My mom was trying to take me back to Italy by force.

470
00:32:35,433 --> 00:32:38,767
But the fact that the person who saved me is my dad,

471
00:32:38,767 --> 00:32:43,210
it's a million times more amazing than I ever imagined when I was little.

472
00:32:44,867 --> 00:32:45,867
My daughter.

473
00:32:45,867 --> 00:32:50,900
So, now that you've run away from Mom, shall we live together?

474
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,020
That sounds good.

475
00:32:57,367 --> 00:32:58,933
Sae Yan, what do you like?

476
00:32:58,933 --> 00:33:01,800
I like everything because I eat well.

477
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:06,900
Dad is… I can't believe I'm calling you dad.

478
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:10,267
- Are you giving this to me? 
 - Yes.

479
00:33:13,267 --> 00:33:16,150
- Oh my! 
 - It's delicious.

480
00:33:18,733 --> 00:33:20,833
Dad.

481
00:33:20,833 --> 00:33:22,533
This.

482
00:33:22,533 --> 00:33:27,150
I've always wanted to pin a carnation on you for Parents' Day.

483
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:34,460
 What flavor...?­ 

484
00:33:34,467 --> 00:33:35,833
I like strawberries.

485
00:33:35,833 --> 00:33:37,433
You like strawberries.

486
00:33:37,433 --> 00:33:40,460
One strawberry and one mango, please.

487
00:33:45,633 --> 00:33:49,500
- Is it good? 
 - Yes.

488
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:52,820
Thank you.

489
00:34:00,467 --> 00:34:03,567
- Oh, you startled me! 
 - Sorry.

490
00:34:03,567 --> 00:34:04,600
Sae Yan, are you okay?

491
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:07,700
- Yes, I'm fine. 
- Oh, okay, goodness.

492
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:10,200
- Gosh. 
 - They startled me.

493
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:12,433
Sae Yan, can you wait just a moment?

494
00:34:12,433 --> 00:34:14,233
I need to make an urgent call.

495
00:34:14,233 --> 00:34:16,980
- Yes, sure. 
 - Just a moment.

496
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:10,367
- Excuse me, Doctor. 
 - Yes.

497
00:35:10,367 --> 00:35:15,633
What if we combine Solution HL13 with the separated mouse brain neural cells?

498
00:35:15,633 --> 00:35:17,700
HL13?

499
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:19,910
I'll take a look at it.

500
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:29,767
- Hello. 
  - Ju Yeon. 

501
00:35:29,767 --> 00:35:33,233
It's me. I thought you might worry, but there's no need to worry.

502
00:35:33,233 --> 00:35:35,833
This isn't bad.

503
00:35:35,833 --> 00:35:36,967
Yes.

504
00:35:36,967 --> 00:35:38,900
Sae Yan, I'll call you back later.

505
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:41,490
 Oh Ju Yeon… 

506
00:35:45,433 --> 00:35:46,500
What's going on?

507
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:48,833
Ah, you startled me.

508
00:35:48,833 --> 00:35:51,700
Who are you calling?

509
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:56,167
Ju Yeon is someone I lived with for a while, so I thought she might be worried…

510
00:35:56,167 --> 00:36:00,010
Don't call again.

511
00:36:00,867 --> 00:36:06,167
For the time being, it's best not to contact anyone, not even Mom.

512
00:36:06,167 --> 00:36:10,167
It would be dangerous if she even tried to track the location through the phone.

513
00:36:10,167 --> 00:36:13,550
I will keep the phone with me.

514
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:17,067
But you don't need to worry about Ju Yeon.

515
00:36:17,067 --> 00:36:20,650
Since she has been helping me to find you.

516
00:36:24,533 --> 00:36:26,833
Now that I've met my daughter,

517
00:36:26,833 --> 00:36:31,120
I'm worried we might be separated again.

518
00:36:32,933 --> 00:36:35,370
You will listen to me. Right?

519
00:36:36,667 --> 00:36:38,350
Yes.

520
00:37:28,433 --> 00:37:30,700
What's the problem?

521
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:06,467
It's done.

522
00:38:06,467 --> 00:38:08,500
It's fine now.

523
00:38:10,267 --> 00:38:12,700
Why? Why?

524
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:15,433
- Is it a success? 
 - Yes.

525
00:38:15,433 --> 00:38:17,267
Thank you.

526
00:38:17,267 --> 00:38:21,433
Kyeong Ju Yeon! It's a success, success!

527
00:38:21,433 --> 00:38:22,467
Wait.

528
00:38:22,467 --> 00:38:24,680
The reset is in two days, right?

529
00:38:25,733 --> 00:38:29,967
We need to remove the side effects first before then.

530
00:38:29,967 --> 00:38:32,267
It takes at least two days to prepare,

531
00:38:32,267 --> 00:38:34,200
but let's try tomorrow night.

532
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:35,567
Tomorrow night.

533
00:38:35,567 --> 00:38:39,333
Thank you, Doctor. Thank you so much.

534
00:38:39,333 --> 00:38:45,000
Tomorrow, his first love memories will return to normal.

535
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:48,067
Until then, please stay by the subject's side.

536
00:38:48,067 --> 00:38:50,633
Since I will take care of Te Oh.

537
00:38:50,633 --> 00:38:52,767
Yes.

538
00:38:52,767 --> 00:38:53,767
You've worked hard.

539
00:38:53,767 --> 00:38:57,767
Kyeong Ju Yeon, you've had it hard.

540
00:38:57,767 --> 00:39:01,267
You did a good job.

541
00:39:16,633 --> 00:39:23,633
   

542
00:39:32,133 --> 00:39:34,900
 It seems that he took her away. 

543
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:37,880
 What should I do about Sae Yan? 

544
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:44,500
I'm back, but I have to go out again right away.

545
00:39:46,133 --> 00:39:49,000
Mom, is something going on?

546
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,867
No.

547
00:39:50,867 --> 00:39:52,670
By any chance,

548
00:39:53,467 --> 00:39:56,600
did you get a call from Sae Yan?

549
00:39:56,600 --> 00:40:01,020
I received a call yesterday, but I hung up because I was busy.

550
00:40:02,033 --> 00:40:03,900
Why? Is something going on?

551
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:07,067
Huh?

552
00:40:07,067 --> 00:40:11,600
Sae Yan went back to Italy with her mother.

553
00:40:12,333 --> 00:40:15,100
What? Suddenly?

554
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:17,267
Why all of a sudden?

555
00:40:17,267 --> 00:40:19,440
That's what happened.

556
00:40:20,467 --> 00:40:22,667
There was no other discussion. Right?

557
00:40:22,667 --> 00:40:26,900
I was busy and hung up right away.

558
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:30,090
I had something to tell Sae Yan.

559
00:40:30,733 --> 00:40:33,540
I wish she had waited a few more days for me.

560
00:40:34,833 --> 00:40:36,300
Oh my, I forgot.

561
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:38,850
Is the stew all done?

562
00:40:39,767 --> 00:40:41,830
Mom.

563
00:41:18,533 --> 00:41:22,633
 It's perfect. The first date with my first love. 

564
00:41:22,633 --> 00:41:26,290
Let's go. Let's go to Ju Yeon.

565
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:41,360
 Last date before sending him to his first love. 

566
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:55,760
Oh, Ju Yeon! Over here.

567
00:41:57,050 --> 00:41:59,240
  ­ 

568
00:42:01,833 --> 00:42:04,967
Can't you gain like 10 more kilos?

569
00:42:04,967 --> 00:42:09,600
Or can't you be about 10 years older?

570
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:12,067
Why? Do I look strange today?

571
00:42:12,067 --> 00:42:14,550
Today, you look so perfect...

572
00:42:15,167 --> 00:42:18,570
that I'm worried you might leave.

573
00:42:19,633 --> 00:42:21,690
It makes me anxious.

574
00:42:24,067 --> 00:42:28,467
Is there something you want to do? I'll do anything you want.

575
00:42:28,467 --> 00:42:31,333
Leave everything about our first date today to me.

576
00:42:31,333 --> 00:42:34,433
I wasn't sure what you would like, so I booked a nice atmosphere restaurant.

577
00:42:34,433 --> 00:42:36,550
Let's go.

578
00:42:38,567 --> 00:42:40,667
Hello.

579
00:42:40,667 --> 00:42:42,167
I made a reservation under the name Lee Kun.

580
00:42:42,167 --> 00:42:44,233
Mr. Lee Kun?

581
00:42:44,233 --> 00:42:46,500
Not like Mr. Kim, Mr. Choi, or anything.

582
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:47,433
Kun as in the single character!

583
00:42:47,433 --> 00:42:49,533
Ah, yes.

584
00:42:49,533 --> 00:42:52,733
Mr. Lee Kun…

585
00:42:52,733 --> 00:42:55,033
You're not on the list?

586
00:42:55,033 --> 00:42:57,000
That can't be.

587
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:01,767
One moment, I even received a confirmation text for the reservation.

588
00:43:01,767 --> 00:43:04,567
Your reservation is for tomorrow though.

589
00:43:04,567 --> 00:43:07,567
No, that can't be.

590
00:43:07,567 --> 00:43:11,367
I know a great buffet restaurant, so let's go there.

591
00:43:11,367 --> 00:43:14,967
I had everything perfectly prepared for today.

592
00:43:14,967 --> 00:43:17,300
We can come back here tomorrow.

593
00:43:17,300 --> 00:43:19,660
Tomorrow? Tomorrow…

594
00:43:22,733 --> 00:43:28,567
You make plans for tomorrow in advance. Do you like me that much?

595
00:43:28,567 --> 00:43:30,567
Yeah, let's go.

596
00:43:30,567 --> 00:43:33,880
To the restaurant you like.

597
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:37,633
Goodbye.

598
00:43:37,633 --> 00:43:39,333
Here you are.

599
00:43:39,333 --> 00:43:43,090
Thank you. Goodbye.

600
00:43:51,833 --> 00:43:56,533
There are things that need to be appropriate for the time, place, and occasion.

601
00:43:56,533 --> 00:44:00,640
It seems like this restaurant can't keep up with my outfit.

602
00:44:04,267 --> 00:44:08,920
Maybe it stands out so much that it's even more stylish?

603
00:44:17,833 --> 00:44:21,733
   

604
00:44:21,733 --> 00:44:24,533
Yes, please enjoy.

605
00:44:24,533 --> 00:44:26,667
You are totally…

606
00:44:26,667 --> 00:44:32,267
You are totally into me.

607
00:44:32,267 --> 00:44:33,733
Seriously…

608
00:44:33,733 --> 00:44:35,300
Ah, everyone.

609
00:44:35,300 --> 00:44:39,233
Now, go ahead, enjoy your meal.

610
00:44:39,233 --> 00:44:44,900
Yes, eat as much as you like. Because this place is a restaurant...

611
00:44:44,900 --> 00:44:47,660
with unlimited refills.

612
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:52,733
Now that I'm here,

613
00:44:52,733 --> 00:44:55,533
this restaurant is no different from a very luxurious restaurant.

614
00:44:55,533 --> 00:44:57,733
Just sit right here and wait.

615
00:44:57,733 --> 00:45:01,010
I'll show off my skills and come back.

616
00:45:04,067 --> 00:45:07,820
Leave it to me. Please wait a moment.

617
00:45:09,230 --> 00:45:12,067
Now, let's see.

618
00:45:12,067 --> 00:45:16,267
A rabbit that resembles you.

619
00:45:16,267 --> 00:45:17,333
It's…

620
00:45:17,333 --> 00:45:18,567
To me,

621
00:45:18,567 --> 00:45:23,600
you are like a very twinkling star.

622
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:25,367
I have prepared a star for you.

623
00:45:25,367 --> 00:45:27,100
When did you make this?

624
00:45:27,100 --> 00:45:28,733
It's so cute.

625
00:45:28,733 --> 00:45:31,433
There's more. It's not over yet.

626
00:45:31,433 --> 00:45:35,560
Ta-da, it's a bunch of vegetables.

627
00:45:37,867 --> 00:45:40,333
A vegetable bunch. I've never seen it before.

628
00:45:40,333 --> 00:45:42,530
Oh, Ju Yeon!

629
00:45:43,300 --> 00:45:45,967
Ta-da.

630
00:45:45,967 --> 00:45:48,133
When did you prepare this?

631
00:45:48,133 --> 00:45:49,400
Just count to three.

632
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:53,167
One, two, three.

633
00:45:53,167 --> 00:45:56,133
Ta-da.

634
00:45:56,133 --> 00:45:57,833
Let's eat up now.

635
00:45:57,833 --> 00:45:59,767
How can I eat this? It's too precious.

636
00:45:59,767 --> 00:46:01,200
Here you go.

637
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:02,667
You may go now.

638
00:46:02,667 --> 00:46:05,720
- Thank you. 
 - Goodbye.

639
00:46:12,733 --> 00:46:15,080
Goodbye.

640
00:46:24,333 --> 00:46:27,150
Would you like to eat an apple?

641
00:46:33,270 --> 00:46:35,890
 I did well, right? 

642
00:46:41,467 --> 00:46:44,920
It's really the digital age.

643
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:50,667
Wow! What is this?

644
00:46:50,667 --> 00:46:53,833
Wow, seriously. It's incredibly splendid.

645
00:46:53,833 --> 00:46:56,750
Feels like we're at a club, right?

646
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:03,380
Isn't it a bit rude to look at your phone while dating?

647
00:47:05,900 --> 00:47:08,600
Sae Yan went back to Italy yesterday.

648
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:12,500
I haven't heard from her since she arrived.

649
00:47:12,500 --> 00:47:14,600
Sae Yan left?

650
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:18,033
She left without even seeing me.

651
00:47:18,033 --> 00:47:20,660
In the end, she couldn't find her father either.

652
00:47:22,700 --> 00:47:24,900
Sae Yan…

653
00:47:24,900 --> 00:47:27,433
If you have time later,

654
00:47:27,433 --> 00:47:30,740
could you go and meet her?

655
00:47:31,700 --> 00:47:34,470
Um, meet Sae Yan?

656
00:47:39,967 --> 00:47:41,533
Sure. Why not?

657
00:47:41,533 --> 00:47:43,970
I'll go with you.

658
00:47:45,900 --> 00:47:49,367
You know, the wish bracelet that Sae Yan gave you.

659
00:47:49,367 --> 00:47:52,120
How is it? Is your wish coming true?

660
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:56,220
About half way?

661
00:48:02,433 --> 00:48:08,010
Your expression looks a little dark.

662
00:48:09,567 --> 00:48:12,900
I'm sorry. I must be a bit tired today.

663
00:48:12,900 --> 00:48:15,600
You're tired, huh?

664
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:19,033
Okay, then.

665
00:48:19,033 --> 00:48:21,700
I'll tell you a healing secret

666
00:48:21,700 --> 00:48:25,450
that will completely eliminate all your fatigue.

667
00:48:27,533 --> 00:48:29,367
So, like this.

668
00:48:29,367 --> 00:48:31,900
Just stand right in front of me like this.

669
00:48:31,900 --> 00:48:35,950
Look into my eyes, and then you'll be healed.

670
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:41,200
You really are full of self-love.

671
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:43,233
That's not it.

672
00:48:43,233 --> 00:48:48,150
See yourself reflected in my eyes.

673
00:48:49,267 --> 00:48:54,390
I get healed every time I see you.

674
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:03,733
Even though we're indoors, maybe it's because the weather's chilly,

675
00:49:03,733 --> 00:49:06,340
I have a runny nose.

676
00:49:10,700 --> 00:49:16,500
♫ The silent streets are filled  ♫

677
00:49:16,500 --> 00:49:20,533
It was so cold outside earlier,

678
00:49:20,533 --> 00:49:25,300
but you didn't even pretend to be cold. Do you know how worried I was?

679
00:49:25,300 --> 00:49:29,290
How is it? Are you a bit warmer now?

680
00:49:30,100 --> 00:49:32,430
Has your heart warmed up as well?

681
00:49:33,100 --> 00:49:34,133
Yes.

682
00:49:34,133 --> 00:49:36,767
Oh? You smiled!

683
00:49:36,767 --> 00:49:39,100
I guess you have nothing to worry about now.

684
00:49:39,100 --> 00:49:40,600
Right? You feel healed, right?

685
00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:42,867
- Yes. 
 - Good.

686
00:49:42,867 --> 00:49:44,800
All right, then.

687
00:49:46,233 --> 00:49:49,800
In a little bit, we'll be greeted by a new world.

688
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:54,960
One, two, three!

689
00:50:00,567 --> 00:50:02,780
I can't see it well.

690
00:50:07,700 --> 00:50:15,500
♫  Walking in the opposite direction in this busy world  ♫

691
00:50:15,500 --> 00:50:20,300
♫  I feel like I'm standing still alone  ♫

692
00:50:20,333 --> 00:50:22,550
Hello.

693
00:50:24,067 --> 00:50:26,633
I want to buy a bracelet.

694
00:50:26,633 --> 00:50:30,450
Is it possible to have it custom made to what I like?

695
00:50:30,450 --> 00:50:36,900
♫  Come closer to me more preciously  ♫

696
00:50:36,900 --> 00:50:44,567
♫  Where will it be, that day  ♫

697
00:50:44,567 --> 00:50:52,260
♫  How much further do I have to go before I can see  ♫

698
00:50:52,260 --> 00:50:55,400
♫  Even if that unreachable dream  ♫

699
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:56,967
 Did you dream of me? 

700
00:50:56,967 --> 00:51:00,700
 59 minutes before meeting. Let's meet at the restaurant from yesterday. 

701
00:51:00,700 --> 00:51:02,770
 Don't be late! 

702
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:08,200
♫  ....becomes more blurred  ♫

703
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:14,400
♫  I will walk towards that day  ♫

704
00:51:19,967 --> 00:51:24,333
   

705
00:51:24,333 --> 00:51:26,233
Yes, Professor Han.

706
00:51:26,233 --> 00:51:28,370
I'm about to meet him now.

707
00:51:29,133 --> 00:51:33,530
I'll head into the research center after laying everything out.

708
00:51:35,300 --> 00:51:36,980
Yes.

709
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:41,367
Kyeong Ju Yeon.

710
00:51:41,367 --> 00:51:45,433
With a resolute heart, Te Oh is now…

711
00:51:45,433 --> 00:51:47,267
Professor Han.

712
00:51:47,267 --> 00:51:49,000
Oh, okay.

713
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:52,833
Let's have a drink tomorrow.

714
00:51:53,567 --> 00:51:55,967
The reset clinical trial set-up is all done for tomorrow. Right?

715
00:51:55,967 --> 00:51:57,100
I'm planning to leave work.

716
00:51:57,100 --> 00:51:58,500
Leaving work?

717
00:51:58,500 --> 00:52:01,867
Oh, then.

718
00:52:01,867 --> 00:52:03,833
Shall we grab a casual drink today?

719
00:52:03,833 --> 00:52:06,467
I have a prior engagement with the hospital director.

720
00:52:06,467 --> 00:52:08,300
Is that so?

721
00:52:08,300 --> 00:52:11,100
Yes, that's good.

722
00:52:11,100 --> 00:52:14,950
No, then see you tomorrow.

723
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:24,200
Don't come running just because you miss me…

724
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:28,700
   

725
00:52:30,667 --> 00:52:31,933
Yes, Inspector Kim.

726
00:52:31,933 --> 00:52:35,333
The DNA of the blackmailer came from the envelope you mentioned.

727
00:52:35,333 --> 00:52:37,333
Who is it? Can I see the picture?

728
00:52:37,333 --> 00:52:40,000
I'm on my way to make inquiries now.

729
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
First, I will send you the pictures by email.

730
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:45,433
Please check if you have seen this person around or if you know him.

731
00:52:45,433 --> 00:52:49,770
I will send you the picture by email in the business card you gave me last time.

732
00:52:50,833 --> 00:52:54,000
   

733
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:57,433
 He's a person with a criminal record of violence, obsession, and stalking. 

734
00:52:57,433 --> 00:52:59,667
 I can't go into details, 

735
00:52:59,667 --> 00:53:02,600
 but he is a dangerous individual who has committed murder. 

736
00:53:02,600 --> 00:53:05,460
Murder?

737
00:53:11,367 --> 00:53:17,367
   

738
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:26,570
  ­ 

739
00:53:34,467 --> 00:53:39,567
   

740
00:54:30,933 --> 00:54:37,167
   

741
00:55:47,020 --> 00:55:50,220
   

742
00:56:10,933 --> 00:56:13,030
Yes, it's Lee Kun.

743
00:56:14,900 --> 00:56:16,800
What did you say?

744
00:56:20,833 --> 00:56:23,800
Ju Yeon!

745
00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:27,067
Please open the door.

746
00:56:28,100 --> 00:56:31,300
Ju Yeon.

747
00:56:34,933 --> 00:56:37,167
This is a very important matter

748
00:56:37,167 --> 00:56:40,650
not only for Ju Yeon but also for you.

749
00:56:42,300 --> 00:56:46,467
By now, everyone's probably preparing the experiment to remove your side effects.

750
00:56:46,467 --> 00:56:48,400
They tried to deceive me

751
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:51,390
and take you away.

752
00:56:54,933 --> 00:56:56,400
What on earth are you talking about?

753
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:58,867
What are these side effects, and what is this experiment you're talking about?

754
00:56:58,867 --> 00:57:02,267
The day you fell into the Han River,

755
00:57:02,267 --> 00:57:07,290
you became a clinical trial subject in addition to the traumatic brain hemorrhage surgery.

756
00:57:09,233 --> 00:57:10,333
Clinical trial?

757
00:57:10,333 --> 00:57:13,500
It's colloquially known as 'the Bad Memory Eraser'.

758
00:57:13,500 --> 00:57:15,167
With the consent of your family,

759
00:57:15,167 --> 00:57:19,000
they erased all of your bad memories from the past.

760
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,033
So that you can forget all the bad memories

761
00:57:21,033 --> 00:57:23,067
from the past and start living anew.

762
00:57:23,067 --> 00:57:26,270
Keeping only good memories like now.

763
00:57:28,067 --> 00:57:30,330
What does that…

764
00:57:39,900 --> 00:57:42,533
What are you talking about?

765
00:57:42,533 --> 00:57:44,833
Where is Ju Yeon?

766
00:57:44,833 --> 00:57:46,067
It's not even worth listening to anymore.

767
00:57:46,067 --> 00:57:49,370
It would be valuable to know who the experimenter is,

768
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:52,950
if the experimenter is...

769
00:57:53,733 --> 00:57:55,750
your beloved Kyeong Ju Yeon.

770
00:57:56,800 --> 00:58:00,533
What? Kyeong Ju Yeon?

771
00:58:00,533 --> 00:58:04,200
You are the test subject, and Kyeong Ju Yeon is the experimenter.

772
00:58:04,200 --> 00:58:05,467
Do you understand now?

773
00:58:05,467 --> 00:58:08,267
She volunteered to be on the team doctor just to observe you.

774
00:58:08,267 --> 00:58:09,833
It was an intentional approach.

775
00:58:09,833 --> 00:58:11,870
Shut up!

776
00:58:16,267 --> 00:58:18,067
If you want to,

777
00:58:18,067 --> 00:58:22,800
I can show you the observation journal that Kyeong Ju Yeon wrote while observing you.

778
00:58:24,500 --> 00:58:25,900
No.

779
00:58:27,033 --> 00:58:28,967
Ju Yeon couldn't have done that.

780
00:58:28,967 --> 00:58:31,367
You probably can't believe it.

781
00:58:31,367 --> 00:58:36,620
Before you hear about the side effects, that fatal error I mentioned earlier…

782
00:58:39,233 --> 00:58:42,167
Fatal error?

783
00:58:42,167 --> 00:58:44,070
Memory distortion.

784
00:58:44,800 --> 00:58:47,400
And your first love.

785
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:49,800
From the start, Kyeong Ju Yeon

786
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:51,333
was not your first love.

787
00:58:51,333 --> 00:58:53,600
Don't talk nonsense.

788
00:58:53,600 --> 00:58:57,920
What on earth are you blabbering about now?

789
00:59:00,333 --> 00:59:04,700
Oh, Dr. Kim. I'm leaving now.

790
00:59:06,667 --> 00:59:11,190
Dr. Te Oh was supposed to have a drink with the hospital director.

791
00:59:13,233 --> 00:59:15,250
Could it be that…

792
00:59:19,933 --> 00:59:21,867
Professor Han.

793
00:59:21,867 --> 00:59:25,267
The number 109 mouse, which underwent the reset experiment, has died.

794
00:59:25,267 --> 00:59:29,233
I checked the cage because there was another mouse in mouse cage 109.

795
00:59:29,233 --> 00:59:33,733
Dr. Te Oh secretly asked the waste disposal guy to take care of it.

796
00:59:33,733 --> 00:59:35,400
When?

797
00:59:35,400 --> 00:59:39,000
That punk, he deceived us!

798
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:41,280
Where is Te Oh now?

799
01:00:10,267 --> 01:00:14,800
If you undergo this clinical trial, everything will return to its place.

800
01:00:14,800 --> 01:00:17,633
Don't you want to return to your true self?

801
01:00:17,633 --> 01:00:20,000
To before Kyeong Ju Yeon deceived you.

802
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,760
To before you were taken advantage of.

803
01:00:24,267 --> 01:00:25,500
Open this door right now.

804
01:00:25,500 --> 01:00:28,570
Te Oh, Yoon Te Oh!

805
01:00:29,900 --> 01:00:31,800
The number 109 mouse is also dead.

806
01:00:31,800 --> 01:00:35,267
Stop it right now!

807
01:00:35,733 --> 01:00:37,533
Professor Han is also in cahoots with her.

808
01:00:37,533 --> 01:00:40,570
He colluded with Kyeong Ju Yeon and used you.

809
01:00:41,533 --> 01:00:42,900
No.

810
01:00:42,900 --> 01:00:45,167
I'll explain everything.

811
01:00:45,167 --> 01:00:47,767
It was all for your sake.

812
01:00:47,767 --> 01:00:51,100
You should never undergo this surgery.

813
01:00:51,100 --> 01:00:54,350
Kyeong Ju Yeon will be coming soon.

814
01:01:01,567 --> 01:01:04,200
No.

815
01:01:04,200 --> 01:01:06,267
No.

816
01:01:06,267 --> 01:01:09,160
No, absolutely not.

817
01:01:21,300 --> 01:01:24,867
I'll pour you some water.

818
01:01:41,367 --> 01:01:44,633
Yes, Professor Han.

819
01:01:45,733 --> 01:01:47,370
What?

820
01:02:29,933 --> 01:02:36,200
♫  That day will become so bright it dazzles your eyes  ♫

821
01:02:36,200 --> 01:02:44,233
♫  Even if your footsteps are still heavy  ♫

822
01:02:44,233 --> 01:02:52,000
♫  I will be by your side, as if it's fate  ♫

823
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:56,933
   

824
01:02:56,933 --> 01:02:59,800
 If someone has to resign, it should be me. But why are you quitting? 

825
01:02:59,800 --> 01:03:01,767
 It all started with my thesis in the first place. 

826
01:03:01,767 --> 01:03:03,367
 It's my responsibility to take care of it. 

827
01:03:03,367 --> 01:03:06,533
 Is it you? Are you the one who spread our video? 

828
01:03:06,533 --> 01:03:08,367
 Sae Yan didn't go to Italy? 

829
01:03:08,367 --> 01:03:10,067
 It seems like she's with her father. 

830
01:03:10,067 --> 01:03:11,467
 I wonder where she's hiding. 

831
01:03:11,467 --> 01:03:14,167
 I've never actually been a mother to them. 

832
01:03:14,167 --> 01:03:16,600
 Every day, you lock yourself in that gloomy room, drinking away, 

833
01:03:16,600 --> 01:03:18,628
 do you know that our family is suffocating because of you? 

834
01:03:18,628 --> 01:03:20,867
 Are you still suffering from trauma? 

835
01:03:20,867 --> 01:03:23,333
 That must be why she's more concerned about you. 

836
01:03:23,333 --> 01:03:25,033
 Because he's just like you. 

837
01:03:25,033 --> 01:03:26,867
 You deceived and used me. 

838
01:03:26,867 --> 01:03:30,440
 I can never forgive you.
