1
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:07,940
 ­  

2
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:14,350
 ­  

3
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:18,070
   

4
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:22,800
   

5
00:00:25,533 --> 00:00:33,400
   

6
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:39,367
   

7
00:00:40,490 --> 00:00:49,570


8
00:00:51,867 --> 00:00:52,967
Good.

9
00:00:52,967 --> 00:00:56,800
Cortisol goes down, serotonin goes up,

10
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:59,700
and the clinical results for number 109 are good.

11
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:03,133
Number 108, whose clinical trial started on the same day…

12
00:01:04,933 --> 00:01:06,700
Hey.

13
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:12,433
It really wasn't because of me, right?

14
00:01:16,033 --> 00:01:20,067
If the clinical trial is successful, all the bad memories

15
00:01:20,067 --> 00:01:23,333
and memories about me will be forgotten.

16
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:25,467
Yeah.

17
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:49,500
Are you going to visit the patient again? You should go home today.

18
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,500
Yes.

19
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:55,133
Your mother has called you several times.

20
00:01:55,833 --> 00:01:58,833
Just for 15 days and nights…

21
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:39,667
You, no…

22
00:02:39,667 --> 00:02:41,867
Mr. Lee?

23
00:02:43,333 --> 00:02:44,700
You woke up?

24
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:48,533
Do you know where this is?

25
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:52,867
Mr. Lee, do you remember anything?

26
00:02:52,867 --> 00:02:55,733
Do you remember why you are here?

27
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:04,033
Do you remember who I am?

28
00:03:04,033 --> 00:03:06,467
Do you recognize me?

29
00:03:08,233 --> 00:03:12,500
Who do you think I am?

30
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:14,733
 Are you okay? 

31
00:03:22,667 --> 00:03:24,967
Finally…

32
00:03:28,233 --> 00:03:30,433
Finally, we meet.

33
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:33,500
Hello?

34
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:35,933
My first love!

35
00:03:35,933 --> 00:03:37,333
What… What are you saying?

36
00:03:37,333 --> 00:03:41,667
I'm your… first… first… what?

37
00:03:41,667 --> 00:03:46,867
I've been looking for you desperately.

38
00:03:47,933 --> 00:03:49,933
Excuse me, just a moment.

39
00:03:49,933 --> 00:03:53,267
Who do you think I am?

40
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,333
- Kun! 
 - Kun!

41
00:03:59,333 --> 00:04:02,833
Are you okay?

42
00:04:02,833 --> 00:04:06,200
Do you recognize us?

43
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:09,167
Doctor, is he all right?

44
00:04:15,667 --> 00:04:16,933
It's perfect.

45
00:04:16,933 --> 00:04:22,000
Even with FMRI, the amygdala's ability to store bad memories is completely stopped.

46
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,367
Hormone levels are also more complete than in the mouse clinical trials.

47
00:04:25,367 --> 00:04:27,067
 Hello, my first love. 

48
00:04:27,067 --> 00:04:29,133
 My first love. 

49
00:04:29,133 --> 00:04:31,967
 Hello, my first love. 

50
00:04:31,967 --> 00:04:35,700
 I'm his first love? I must have heard it wrong, right? 

51
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:38,000
 Hello, my first love. 

52
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,500
 What if I didn't hear it wrong? 

53
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,933
 Symptoms of delirium? 

54
00:04:41,933 --> 00:04:45,467
 Are there any side effects? 

55
00:04:46,233 --> 00:04:48,400
Kyeong Ju Yeon!

56
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,433
Yes?

57
00:04:49,433 --> 00:04:52,000
Finally! Finally, we made it!

58
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,167
We erased the bad memories!

59
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:58,467
The data is perfect and there seem to be no side effects.

60
00:04:58,467 --> 00:05:01,700
Wait, I'll report to the hospital director first.

61
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:04,900
We're not at the reporting stage yet…

62
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:09,533
Human testing is not animal testing, and a detailed interview comes first.

63
00:05:09,533 --> 00:05:11,900
She's right.

64
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:15,867
I want to brag about this achievement quickly.

65
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:28,267
   

66
00:05:33,233 --> 00:05:35,000
What?

67
00:05:38,033 --> 00:05:41,600
Kun, are you all right?

68
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:47,100
Kun, what's your name?

69
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:49,500
You just told him his name.

70
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:53,667
Do you recognize who we are?

71
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:56,733
You two are sculptors, right?

72
00:05:56,733 --> 00:05:59,167
What?

73
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:03,700
A sculptor? A sculptor who sculpts?

74
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:08,433
Since you gave birth to a sculptural handsome man like me, aren't you a sculptor?

75
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,630
Oh dear.

76
00:06:12,633 --> 00:06:15,500
Isn't it so obvious that it's no fun?

77
00:06:16,133 --> 00:06:20,667
Do you remember that you got hurt?

78
00:06:22,467 --> 00:06:24,633
Did I get hurt?

79
00:06:24,633 --> 00:06:28,300
With these long legs,

80
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:30,767
white skin,

81
00:06:30,767 --> 00:06:32,900
and...

82
00:06:33,667 --> 00:06:38,233
perfect six-pack abs, where did I get hurt?

83
00:06:38,233 --> 00:06:41,000
Did he say 'six-pack abs'?

84
00:06:46,267 --> 00:06:49,533
- Why? 
 - Why? Are you sick?

85
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:53,600
- Call a doctor now.
 - Doctor? Nurse?

86
00:07:01,333 --> 00:07:04,233
Luckily, my face wasn't hurt.

87
00:07:04,233 --> 00:07:06,830
Oh my god...

88
00:07:06,833 --> 00:07:07,667
What's this?

89
00:07:07,667 --> 00:07:11,000
Oh… Don't touch that.

90
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,367
That's because you hurt your head a little bit.

91
00:07:14,367 --> 00:07:18,000
You had minor surgery, but you'll be fine.

92
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,033
You.

93
00:07:20,033 --> 00:07:23,100
Finally, you're back as my friend Lee Kun.

94
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:25,300
You're back!

95
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,400
Do you remember?

96
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,933
When is your last memory?

97
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:43,067
What I remember clearly is the Junior World Championship finals.

98
00:07:43,067 --> 00:07:45,033
I won, right?

99
00:07:45,033 --> 00:07:47,567
 Only the bad memories 

100
00:07:47,567 --> 00:07:50,033
 have been erased. 

101
00:07:50,033 --> 00:07:53,600
Stability is important right now, so take it slow.

102
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:56,900
They say amnesia is a common aftereffect of an accident.

103
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:59,367
Everyone, please stop giving him so much headache.

104
00:07:59,367 --> 00:08:01,033
Aftereffects of an accident?

105
00:08:01,033 --> 00:08:03,600
What accident happened?

106
00:08:04,467 --> 00:08:07,500
Oh, well. That…

107
00:08:08,233 --> 00:08:10,500
You fell down the stairs.

108
00:08:11,467 --> 00:08:12,933
On the stairs of your house.

109
00:08:12,933 --> 00:08:14,733
Stairs?

110
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:18,667
Did I fall down the stairs?

111
00:08:18,667 --> 00:08:19,933
Stairs…

112
00:08:19,933 --> 00:08:22,233
Really?

113
00:08:22,233 --> 00:08:25,967
Is the brain science research center finally accomplishing something successful?

114
00:08:25,967 --> 00:08:27,567
Shh.

115
00:08:27,567 --> 00:08:30,000
It's still a secret.

116
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,533
Well, I'm expecting at least one small award.

117
00:08:34,533 --> 00:08:37,500
A Nobel Prize?

118
00:08:40,933 --> 00:08:44,800
The brain center was making a loss, so I was going to close it down.

119
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,900
There are no mistakes this time, right?

120
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:48,467
Last time, that lab rat was also…

121
00:08:48,467 --> 00:08:50,800
Oh, don't worry.

122
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:55,300
We plan to isolate the subjects and closely

123
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:58,900
observe him 24 hours a day for 100 days.

124
00:09:03,767 --> 00:09:07,967
There is no mention of first love in the counseling records.

125
00:09:07,967 --> 00:09:10,633
 I'm thinking about going to 

126
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:15,167
 the alumni association and meeting my first love. 

127
00:09:15,167 --> 00:09:18,100
He went to find his first love, but why is his first love me?

128
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:20,633
Is that a real side effect?

129
00:09:20,633 --> 00:09:22,933
This is driving me crazy.

130
00:09:25,667 --> 00:09:28,767
Mom made it, so eat a lot.

131
00:09:31,267 --> 00:09:35,933
We shouldn't run into each other when people are around until I check it out in person.

132
00:09:36,433 --> 00:09:39,400
The subject must never be aware of

133
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:41,833
the experiment or of his past.

134
00:09:41,833 --> 00:09:46,433
Until things stabilize, he shouldn't meet anyone who reminds him of the past.

135
00:09:46,433 --> 00:09:50,667
You said you'd only erase bad memories, but why did you erase so many memories?

136
00:09:50,667 --> 00:09:54,133
This is proof that everything recently has been a bad memory.

137
00:09:54,133 --> 00:09:57,867
All he remembers are good memories.

138
00:09:57,867 --> 00:10:00,033
Sports related, friends.

139
00:10:00,033 --> 00:10:03,700
But family was…

140
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:06,000
It was only part of it…

141
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,433
Did he by any chance have someone he loved?

142
00:10:09,433 --> 00:10:13,567
A girlfriend or a woman he liked.

143
00:10:13,567 --> 00:10:17,133
Well, that…

144
00:10:17,133 --> 00:10:19,867
Do you know anything?

145
00:10:19,867 --> 00:10:22,300
- You're his friend. 
 - What?

146
00:10:23,933 --> 00:10:26,033
Well.

147
00:10:26,033 --> 00:10:27,467
I'm not sure.

148
00:10:27,467 --> 00:10:29,000
He doesn't know anything about him.

149
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Are you sure there are no side effects?

150
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,700
Yes, not so far.

151
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:37,800
But clinical trials are unpredictable.

152
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:41,900
The guardian said he would take the risk.

153
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:45,033
Yeah, I said that.

154
00:10:45,033 --> 00:10:47,733
I was the first to ask for the clinical trial.

155
00:10:47,733 --> 00:10:49,700
Did you?

156
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:51,067
Why?

157
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:54,333
Then what if something big happens.

158
00:10:54,333 --> 00:10:58,267
You all know why your son was brought to the hospital, right?

159
00:10:58,267 --> 00:11:01,300
Isn't it because every day feels like hell

160
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:04,667
that he made such an extreme choice?

161
00:11:04,667 --> 00:11:07,633
Here are the results from today's test.

162
00:11:08,667 --> 00:11:10,167
Your son is now

163
00:11:10,167 --> 00:11:12,167
reborn as he was

164
00:11:12,167 --> 00:11:15,933
before he had any bad memories.

165
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:23,750
These deep,

166
00:11:24,367 --> 00:11:26,700
profound,

167
00:11:27,733 --> 00:11:29,700
and addictive eyes.

168
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:42,390
Hey, guys.

169
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:47,200
You guys are also intoxicated by my scent.

170
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:56,533
Patient.

171
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:05,567
I'll measure your pulse and blood pressure.

172
00:12:06,467 --> 00:12:08,300
Don't you need to take your pulse?

173
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:12,100
I think your heart is pounding because of me.

174
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:15,200
I guess you're bored.

175
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:17,610
 ­  

176
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:22,320
 ­  

177
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:24,740
   

178
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:30,567
What? First love…

179
00:12:30,567 --> 00:12:32,167
I must have misheard.

180
00:12:32,167 --> 00:12:35,067
Yeah, I must have misheard.

181
00:12:36,533 --> 00:12:37,633
What are you doing here?

182
00:12:37,633 --> 00:12:40,640
I think you were looking for me unofficially.

183
00:12:41,167 --> 00:12:43,300
Mr. Lee, please listen carefully.

184
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:45,767
I'm your doctor, not your first love.

185
00:12:45,767 --> 00:12:48,833
I don't know the exact reason, but you were mistaken for a moment.

186
00:12:48,833 --> 00:12:49,733
Am I mistaken?

187
00:12:49,733 --> 00:12:54,467
Yes, you and I are just a doctor and patient. That's all there is to it.

188
00:12:54,467 --> 00:12:58,300
You really don't know me?

189
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:02,367
I saw you for the first time in the operating room.

190
00:13:03,067 --> 00:13:04,167
Well.

191
00:13:04,167 --> 00:13:08,767
My face is so memorable. How could you not remember it?

192
00:13:08,767 --> 00:13:10,367
Do you really not remember?

193
00:13:10,367 --> 00:13:11,567
What are you saying?

194
00:13:11,567 --> 00:13:13,500
This doesn't make sense…

195
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,933
Shh.

196
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:23,467
 It's so hard. 

197
00:13:23,467 --> 00:13:25,567
 I can't even take a rest. 

198
00:13:25,567 --> 00:13:27,300
 Will you 

199
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:30,967
 - give me a massage later?  
 - Massage?

200
00:13:31,667 --> 00:13:34,733
Where, where?

201
00:13:36,167 --> 00:13:39,600
Other than the lips.

202
00:13:40,367 --> 00:13:42,500
 No. 

203
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:47,500
 A little further down? 

204
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:50,033
Oh my, why are you gulping? Why?

205
00:13:50,033 --> 00:13:51,867
Pervert.

206
00:13:51,867 --> 00:13:54,633
What are you thinking? Calf! Calf!

207
00:13:54,633 --> 00:13:57,333
Oh, calf!

208
00:13:57,333 --> 00:13:58,800
 ­  

209
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:02,650
Oppa, I'll call you back.

210
00:14:02,650 --> 00:14:05,430
 ­  

211
00:14:05,430 --> 00:14:07,500
 Is anybody there? 

212
00:14:08,067 --> 00:14:10,433
It's not opening.

213
00:14:10,433 --> 00:14:12,067
Why isn't the door opening?

214
00:14:12,067 --> 00:14:16,933
First of all, you must not tell anyone about this!

215
00:14:17,833 --> 00:14:19,933
Open it.

216
00:14:21,167 --> 00:14:22,800
We were all alone

217
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:25,800
in this small room without anyone knowing.

218
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:29,067
Is it okay if people know?

219
00:14:29,067 --> 00:14:30,533
What?

220
00:14:30,533 --> 00:14:33,367
It just seems like a doctor talking quietly with a patient.

221
00:14:33,367 --> 00:14:34,700
Yeah?

222
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:37,100
Then, I'll open it.

223
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:38,633
Yes, open it.

224
00:14:38,633 --> 00:14:40,833
 Oh, Dr. Te Oh? 

225
00:14:42,433 --> 00:14:43,467
- What are you doing? 
  - It's not opening?  

226
00:14:43,467 --> 00:14:45,567
 Yes. 

227
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:48,400
What's wrong with the door?

228
00:14:52,467 --> 00:14:55,800
Push it now, quickly!

229
00:14:57,067 --> 00:15:00,933
 His bad memories are erased, but his wrist is still the same? 

230
00:15:00,933 --> 00:15:05,933
 Then the experiment wasn't perfect? 

231
00:15:05,933 --> 00:15:07,500
Why aren't you pushing with your right hand?

232
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:11,433
Because this one hand is enough.

233
00:15:13,467 --> 00:15:15,267
 It's not opening. 

234
00:15:15,267 --> 00:15:18,200
This won't work. I'll have to call security.

235
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,567
 - Hello?  
 - What should we do?

236
00:15:19,567 --> 00:15:22,733
 - Yes, security, right?  
 - Go in there.

237
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:25,467
In that laundry basket?

238
00:15:25,467 --> 00:15:28,933
In that unsanitary, germ-filled ball of fabric

239
00:15:28,933 --> 00:15:32,067
that might have been worn by some patients?

240
00:15:32,067 --> 00:15:35,067
If I go in there, I might catch something that I didn't have before.

241
00:15:35,067 --> 00:15:37,433
Or you can go in yourself.

242
00:15:37,433 --> 00:15:39,100
Don't you know the spirit of chivalry?

243
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:40,167
Don't you know the spirit of a doctor?

244
00:15:40,167 --> 00:15:43,433
I am a patient, look.

245
00:15:43,433 --> 00:15:44,533
Well.

246
00:15:44,533 --> 00:15:46,500
Can't you even do that

247
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:50,233
for the first love who you've been waiting for for so long?

248
00:15:50,233 --> 00:15:53,433
I love you,

249
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:03,033
but I love myself more.

250
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,633
Then let's play rock, paper, scissors.

251
00:16:10,633 --> 00:16:12,800
Oh, yes.

252
00:16:17,967 --> 00:16:20,533
- Okay, Professor, I understand. 
 - Someone was inside.

253
00:16:20,533 --> 00:16:23,033
What happened?

254
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:29,033
Senior didn't you say you were going to have a family interview?

255
00:16:29,033 --> 00:16:30,767
The guardians are waiting.

256
00:16:30,767 --> 00:16:32,633
Yeah, I should go.

257
00:16:32,633 --> 00:16:36,267
Have you done the sterile room feces check? What about the statistical report?

258
00:16:36,267 --> 00:16:38,500
I'll check it right away.

259
00:16:41,933 --> 00:16:44,200
- I'll go. 
 - Yes.

260
00:17:05,533 --> 00:17:08,333
Still, I'm glad the result of the surgery was good.

261
00:17:08,333 --> 00:17:10,533
Right.

262
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:16,367
You should go to the court now. This season is so important.

263
00:17:16,367 --> 00:17:17,800
No, this won't do.

264
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:22,367
You should warm up your body by adding nighttime PT.

265
00:17:22,367 --> 00:17:23,967
- Yes. 
 - He's not having a baby or something.

266
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:26,033
How does he always warm up his body?

267
00:17:26,033 --> 00:17:28,400
He has to get some rest.

268
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,700
The more you relax, the more flexible your body becomes.

269
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:31,800
Go.

270
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:34,267
Wait, Kun is…

271
00:17:34,267 --> 00:17:36,267
ADR, oh, PCR, PCR.

272
00:17:36,267 --> 00:17:38,833
Just stay still.

273
00:17:39,733 --> 00:17:42,100
You go now.

274
00:17:46,833 --> 00:17:50,867
I'm Shin's mom. When will Kun's inspection be over?

275
00:17:51,367 --> 00:17:52,933
Isn't he in the hospital room?

276
00:17:52,933 --> 00:17:55,067
What?

277
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:58,700
What should we do? We're dead.

278
00:17:59,267 --> 00:18:03,367
Strangely, I get so angry when I check out other people's social media.

279
00:18:03,367 --> 00:18:05,533
When I get angry, I drink a glass of makgeolli,

280
00:18:05,533 --> 00:18:08,867
and after drinking, my face gets even more swollen,

281
00:18:08,867 --> 00:18:10,167
so I get angry again.

282
00:18:10,167 --> 00:18:12,333
Dr. Kyeong—

283
00:18:13,633 --> 00:18:15,033
As a result,

284
00:18:15,033 --> 00:18:17,800
I think I have anger management issues.

285
00:18:18,633 --> 00:18:21,467
You said you were suffering from depression 6 months ago, panic disorder 4 months ago,

286
00:18:21,467 --> 00:18:24,433
and anger management disorder this week.

287
00:18:24,433 --> 00:18:27,233
You are self-diagnosing.

288
00:18:29,333 --> 00:18:32,200
Should I quit social media?

289
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:34,067
This week, please quit social media.

290
00:18:34,067 --> 00:18:36,900
Make sure to see the morning sunlight and exercise regularly.

291
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:39,100
Don't think of it as holding back from being angry,

292
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:41,567
but first think about whether it's something worth getting angry about.

293
00:18:41,567 --> 00:18:44,633
 Ju Yeon, it's emergency. The subject has escaped. 

294
00:18:45,967 --> 00:18:49,933
Yeah, that social media was the problem.

295
00:18:49,933 --> 00:18:52,633
There's nothing without a reason.

296
00:18:52,633 --> 00:18:55,367
Then, Dr. Kyeong, see you next week.

297
00:18:55,367 --> 00:18:57,833
- Goodbye. 
 - Yes.

298
00:18:57,833 --> 00:18:59,933
Goodbye.

299
00:19:03,033 --> 00:19:04,767
Yeah.

300
00:19:04,767 --> 00:19:07,500
There's a reason for everything.

301
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,967
Why did he…

302
00:19:09,967 --> 00:19:12,767
 You must not touch anything. 

303
00:19:23,067 --> 00:19:27,767
What if the memories were manipulated at the moment they were erased?

304
00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:51,970
 ­   

305
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,633
 Kun. 

306
00:20:06,310 --> 00:20:08,260
 ­ You're so cute! 

307
00:20:08,267 --> 00:20:11,030
 You look so handsome. 

308
00:20:11,030 --> 00:20:12,130
 ­  

309
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:19,233
 One, two, three. 

310
00:20:30,167 --> 00:20:33,067
When will my memories come back?

311
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:40,267
I don't know.

312
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:56,300
Let's just not worry about it.

313
00:21:02,233 --> 00:21:04,167
I don't like it.

314
00:21:04,167 --> 00:21:08,000
Is this something a person wears? I don't like it.

315
00:21:10,733 --> 00:21:13,433
I feel like my eyesight is deteriorating.

316
00:21:13,433 --> 00:21:15,767
The color should be splendid

317
00:21:15,767 --> 00:21:20,500
and beautiful like this.

318
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:23,700
I also like it.

319
00:21:28,233 --> 00:21:31,467
Awesome, it's cool.

320
00:21:31,467 --> 00:21:33,433
Spectacle, suspense, thriller,

321
00:21:33,433 --> 00:21:38,200
road movie, lovely, real erotically cool.

322
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:40,967
What is that ugly dog?

323
00:21:40,967 --> 00:21:44,800
It's not your fault you're ugly, but

324
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:48,433
it's your fault for not dressing up.

325
00:22:00,033 --> 00:22:02,067
Cola.

326
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:06,400
What?

327
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:33,300
Why am I crying?

328
00:22:36,033 --> 00:22:38,233
Hey.

329
00:22:38,233 --> 00:22:40,333
Hey?

330
00:22:41,233 --> 00:22:43,200
This is ridiculous.

331
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:46,933
Brother! Call me 'brother'.

332
00:22:47,733 --> 00:22:49,833
Brother.

333
00:22:50,433 --> 00:22:52,700
He is a male.

334
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:55,633
How did you find the house? Do you remember the password?

335
00:22:55,633 --> 00:22:57,633
Here it is.

336
00:22:57,633 --> 00:23:00,767
Your ID, your card key.

337
00:23:00,767 --> 00:23:01,900
When did you take mine?

338
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:03,567
There was no bathtub

339
00:23:03,567 --> 00:23:05,700
in the hospital.

340
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:08,300
I have to take a half-body bath like this

341
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:11,800
to get my blood circulation like this.

342
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:14,667
No matter how I look at it, this isn't my room.

343
00:23:14,667 --> 00:23:18,700
The interior is crude.

344
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,200
Didn't I have an eye for the interior?

345
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:24,400
What?

346
00:23:25,933 --> 00:23:28,000
It's your room.

347
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,500
That expensive watch on your wrist is yours,

348
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:33,633
and that designer suit you wore just once during fashion week

349
00:23:33,633 --> 00:23:36,767
is also yours…

350
00:23:37,733 --> 00:23:41,533
The eldest son of the family has returned, but…

351
00:23:41,533 --> 00:23:42,833
Doesn't he say hello to me?

352
00:23:42,833 --> 00:23:46,000
You educate him again.

353
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:50,967
Otherwise, he'll sleep in the heat when it's hot and in the cold when it's cold.

354
00:23:54,833 --> 00:23:58,000
I feel anxious every day, what should I do?

355
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,667
I guess the clinical trials were for nothing.

356
00:23:59,667 --> 00:24:01,900
He brightened up though.

357
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:05,467
Even though he's a bit narcissistic now, it's good to have high self-esteem.

358
00:24:05,467 --> 00:24:08,067
And do you see this?

359
00:24:08,067 --> 00:24:11,367
The luggage that Kun brought back from England is still unpacked.

360
00:24:11,367 --> 00:24:12,567
We've been

361
00:24:12,567 --> 00:24:16,567
so indifferent to Kun all this time.

362
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:22,800
But that doesn't mean he can play tennis again after 15 years.

363
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,800
Kun? Kun?

364
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:30,167
Kun!

365
00:24:39,267 --> 00:24:42,567
Is he that handsome because he looks like me?

366
00:24:42,567 --> 00:24:45,933
Why are you suddenly wearing Shin's clothes…

367
00:24:47,967 --> 00:24:51,867
The hospital was teeming with germs, so I washed up to feel refreshed.

368
00:24:51,867 --> 00:24:55,000
But why did you just leave the hospital without saying anything?

369
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,300
Everyone is worried.

370
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:58,833
Right.

371
00:24:58,833 --> 00:25:01,867
Coffee. Thank you.

372
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:04,667
Well.

373
00:25:04,667 --> 00:25:07,000
What are you going to do if you suddenly come out and collapse

374
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,233
as soon as you wake up like this?

375
00:25:09,233 --> 00:25:13,067
Yeah, there's chaos right now because you disappeared from the hospital.

376
00:25:13,067 --> 00:25:16,233
I thought that coming home would help me

377
00:25:16,233 --> 00:25:18,900
regain my lost memories.

378
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:20,067
However,

379
00:25:20,067 --> 00:25:23,833
did I fall down those stairs and have an accident?

380
00:25:23,833 --> 00:25:27,433
Oh, I think you misstepped.

381
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:30,800
Didn't I fall into the Han river?

382
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:31,600
- No. 
 - No.

383
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:35,600
No, it's not.

384
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:36,933
Make me an espresso.

385
00:25:36,933 --> 00:25:41,167
Ethiopian Yirgacheffe single origin.

386
00:25:41,167 --> 00:25:43,467
Yeah.

387
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,567
By the way,

388
00:25:47,567 --> 00:25:50,733
I just remember playing tennis.

389
00:25:50,733 --> 00:25:53,833
How have I been doing lately?

390
00:25:53,833 --> 00:25:58,067
You were just like you are now.

391
00:25:58,667 --> 00:26:02,200
Looking at the racket makes me feel…

392
00:26:06,267 --> 00:26:08,533
Well,

393
00:26:08,533 --> 00:26:10,100
tennis…

394
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:13,967
Oh, I was going to tell you that when you got settled.

395
00:26:13,967 --> 00:26:17,400
Well, you'll find out anyway, so your mom will tell you.

396
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:20,833
Why is this so messy?

397
00:26:20,833 --> 00:26:24,267
You…

398
00:26:24,267 --> 00:26:26,733
You retired as a tennis player.

399
00:26:29,033 --> 00:26:31,667
You wanted to learn how to run a company.

400
00:26:31,667 --> 00:26:35,000
So, after graduating from college, you joined a sports agency.

401
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,967
The agency that Shin belongs to.

402
00:26:36,967 --> 00:26:40,533
Running a company?

403
00:26:40,533 --> 00:26:42,067
 [Big Picture Agency Manager, Lee Kun 

404
00:26:42,067 --> 00:26:44,067
Agency Manager.

405
00:26:44,067 --> 00:26:47,633
You just quit exercising, but you're too smart.

406
00:26:47,633 --> 00:26:50,833
That's not all. Besides that…

407
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:58,033
You had a very clear presence.

408
00:26:58,033 --> 00:27:00,333
Plus,

409
00:27:00,333 --> 00:27:02,867
you were popular.

410
00:27:02,867 --> 00:27:05,367
What is this?

411
00:27:05,367 --> 00:27:10,000
With both men and women.

412
00:27:12,033 --> 00:27:14,700
Well, it's not different

413
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:18,067
from what I expected.

414
00:27:18,067 --> 00:27:20,000
I'm sure you're happy

415
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,433
to have a son like me.

416
00:27:26,267 --> 00:27:29,300
Isn't that my suitcase?

417
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:31,567
- It's something I treasured. 
 - Oh, this is…

418
00:27:31,567 --> 00:27:33,267
I borrowed it for a while.

419
00:27:33,267 --> 00:27:36,600
I'll wipe it.

420
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:39,600
Well then,

421
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:42,200
I'll go to the hospital first.

422
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:45,267
Since this dressing also needs to be changed.

423
00:27:45,267 --> 00:27:47,200
Well then.

424
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:53,467
Who should I hang out with today?

425
00:27:53,467 --> 00:27:54,900
Is it you?

426
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:56,467
No, it's not.

427
00:27:56,467 --> 00:27:59,233
Is it you?

428
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:06,733
It's you today.

429
00:28:12,633 --> 00:28:13,733
Oh, it's good.

430
00:28:13,733 --> 00:28:16,467
You and I have to wear these sunglasses

431
00:28:16,467 --> 00:28:19,300
because it's so dazzling.

432
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:23,467
I wish you had listened to me earlier like this.

433
00:28:23,467 --> 00:28:25,567
You're so shy.

434
00:28:25,567 --> 00:28:28,867
It took so long.

435
00:28:28,867 --> 00:28:31,533
I'm leaving.

436
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:36,167
Where did this go wrong?

437
00:28:36,167 --> 00:28:38,733
Right.

438
00:28:39,467 --> 00:28:42,867
What are you talking about?

439
00:28:42,867 --> 00:28:45,567
An error occurred during the clinical trial?

440
00:28:45,567 --> 00:28:47,367
It's my fault.

441
00:28:47,367 --> 00:28:50,667
I think some of the memories were reconstructed as they disappeared.

442
00:28:50,667 --> 00:28:54,633
So he mistook you for his first love?

443
00:28:57,133 --> 00:28:59,767
Oh, my.

444
00:28:59,767 --> 00:29:03,133
How about being honest with the subject and finding another subject?

445
00:29:03,133 --> 00:29:04,867
If it doesn't work out, I'll do it.

446
00:29:04,867 --> 00:29:09,000
Research is important, but we can't ignore side effects.

447
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:14,367
This was barely approved by the ethics committee.

448
00:29:14,367 --> 00:29:18,300
The prerequisite is that 'the subject must be in an extreme situation'.

449
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:21,867
Even if the study is stopped, side effects cannot be hidden from him.

450
00:29:21,867 --> 00:29:25,067
He is a patient I have been observing for over ten years.

451
00:29:25,067 --> 00:29:27,267
He went from being a promising tennis player

452
00:29:27,267 --> 00:29:30,433
to living in his brother's shadow in a moment.

453
00:29:30,433 --> 00:29:34,533
He eventually became so pessimistic that he even attempted suicide.

454
00:29:34,533 --> 00:29:39,400
He has finally found his life through clinical trials.

455
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:43,867
Ju Yeon, Ju Yeon.

456
00:29:47,233 --> 00:29:52,267
 As you said, the patient's life depends on it. 

457
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:57,833
 How could we tell him to go back to the way he was before because of a small misunderstanding? 

458
00:29:57,833 --> 00:30:00,267
Mr. Lee.

459
00:30:01,533 --> 00:30:03,267
   

460
00:30:03,267 --> 00:30:07,533
So are you telling me to lie and pretend to be that woman?

461
00:30:07,533 --> 00:30:09,600
I'm not saying that because I don't want the experiment to fail.

462
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:12,067
I don't want to waste this patient's opportunity.

463
00:30:12,067 --> 00:30:15,100
What did he look like when you saw him? Didn't he look happy?

464
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:18,033
What kind of life does the patient want?

465
00:30:18,567 --> 00:30:20,867
All treatments have side effects,

466
00:30:20,867 --> 00:30:24,800
and it is the doctor's role and duty to resolve them.

467
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:28,267
Just for the time being, until we find the cause of the error.

468
00:30:28,267 --> 00:30:29,800
Even though…

469
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:32,133
What do you think will happen if this experiment is stopped?

470
00:30:32,133 --> 00:30:35,200
We can't even find the cause of the error.

471
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:38,000
Let's somehow find the cause and fix it.

472
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,267
We can do that. I'll do that.

473
00:30:41,267 --> 00:30:46,300
Of course, I will follow your decision,

474
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:52,967
but as the attending physician of a patient whom I have been watching for over 10 years,

475
00:30:52,967 --> 00:30:55,267
I ask you to take care of him.

476
00:31:04,033 --> 00:31:07,000
Oh my, I haven't even started yet.

477
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:10,067
Why are you making such a fuss?

478
00:31:11,433 --> 00:31:13,833
Well…

479
00:31:13,833 --> 00:31:16,767
What do women think of a man in a suit?

480
00:31:16,767 --> 00:31:21,667
If you go out without permission again,

481
00:31:21,667 --> 00:31:25,233
I might do something to this suit.

482
00:31:30,167 --> 00:31:32,367
- Stay still! 
 - Nurse,

483
00:31:32,367 --> 00:31:33,900
aren't you deliberately making it hurt more right now?

484
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:38,333
I have to work overtime because of you, so you have to put up with this much.

485
00:31:38,333 --> 00:31:41,533
Dr. Kyeong has been watching over

486
00:31:41,533 --> 00:31:45,133
your hospital room without resting a single day

487
00:31:45,133 --> 00:31:47,433
since the day you had surgery.

488
00:31:47,433 --> 00:31:52,000
So listen to her, please!

489
00:32:05,767 --> 00:32:08,500
 Have you decided to meet her? 

490
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:10,567
 Your first love? 

491
00:32:13,133 --> 00:32:15,333
 Aren't you so traumatized that 

492
00:32:15,333 --> 00:32:18,900
 you're even afraid of meeting your first love? 

493
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:21,633
 Because bad memories can be offset by good memories. 

494
00:32:21,633 --> 00:32:24,700
 If you stop being scared and meet her... 

495
00:32:25,567 --> 00:32:28,433
 What if even good memories turn into bad memories? 

496
00:32:28,433 --> 00:32:30,800
 Will you take responsibility? 

497
00:32:31,467 --> 00:32:34,400
He said that his first love was a good memory,

498
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:37,633
but why did he want to erase that, too?

499
00:32:39,068 --> 00:32:41,832
   

500
00:32:45,833 --> 00:32:48,700
Yes, no.

501
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:53,000
It's because I'm busy.

502
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,500
 You practically live in the lab. 

503
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:59,400
Why don't you change your address to there instead?

504
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:02,533
They say that other families' daughters just go shopping

505
00:33:02,533 --> 00:33:05,167
with their mothers and help with housework.

506
00:33:05,167 --> 00:33:06,767
I make money for you.

507
00:33:06,767 --> 00:33:11,100
What keeps a psychiatrist busy at night?

508
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:16,100
Have you met a man recently?

509
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:18,733
 Sorry, sorry. If that's the case, I won't bother you again. 

510
00:33:18,733 --> 00:33:21,567
Yeah. I'm seeing a guy, so don't bother me.

511
00:33:21,567 --> 00:33:24,233
 I don't believe you. 

512
00:33:24,767 --> 00:33:29,167
You don't just throw your bra everywhere and go braless in your workroom

513
00:33:29,167 --> 00:33:32,033
like you do at home, do you?

514
00:33:32,033 --> 00:33:33,533
How did she know that?

515
00:33:33,533 --> 00:33:36,433
In everything else, you resemble me,

516
00:33:36,433 --> 00:33:41,100
but your chest resembles your father.

517
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:44,633
How can my breasts resemble my father's?

518
00:33:44,633 --> 00:33:47,600
Don't go around saying things like that.

519
00:33:48,733 --> 00:33:51,000
You scared me!

520
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,333
Mom, hang up.

521
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:58,133
How much of the call did you hear?

522
00:34:04,467 --> 00:34:05,800
You heard it all.

523
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:07,133
 Hear what? 

524
00:34:07,133 --> 00:34:08,500
Didn't you hear me?

525
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:11,367
I said your chest resembles your father's.

526
00:34:11,367 --> 00:34:14,867
 - It would be nice if you were like me.  
 - Hang up, hang up.

527
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:19,433
But why are you talking to my mother-in-law like that?

528
00:34:19,433 --> 00:34:21,667
Who's your mother-in-law? Did you have a dream?

529
00:34:21,667 --> 00:34:23,067
Yes, I dreamed.

530
00:34:23,067 --> 00:34:26,033
I had a dream that I have to get married when I find my first love.

531
00:34:26,033 --> 00:34:27,633
Yes, live well with your first love.

532
00:34:27,633 --> 00:34:30,833
But I'm not your first love.

533
00:34:31,967 --> 00:34:34,800
You're not my first love or my doctor,

534
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:37,900
but you've been by my side for days,

535
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:40,333
without even going home

536
00:34:40,333 --> 00:34:43,033
ever since my surgery. Why is that?

537
00:34:45,567 --> 00:34:48,233
I heard you were there 24 hours a day, excluding clinic hours,

538
00:34:48,233 --> 00:34:51,100
so did you even help me go to the bathroom?

539
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:54,767
If I had a girlfriend,

540
00:34:54,767 --> 00:34:59,867
she would have misunderstood you very, very much. Isn't that so?

541
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:08,800
I'm afraid you might have been waiting for me,

542
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:12,333
so I'm telling you to drink this and get some sleep.

543
00:35:12,333 --> 00:35:15,333
It's hot, it's hot, take it quickly.

544
00:35:15,333 --> 00:35:16,433
Take it.

545
00:35:16,433 --> 00:35:18,833
Put it down there.

546
00:35:19,567 --> 00:35:23,400
Oh, I thought of you, but you're being so cold to me.

547
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:27,167
You still don't remember me?

548
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,900
You don't have to remember me.

549
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:37,333
Because I remember you.

550
00:35:42,967 --> 00:35:45,133
 It feels like my body doesn't remember 

551
00:35:45,133 --> 00:35:47,933
 the lost memories, 

552
00:35:47,933 --> 00:35:50,000
 but my mind remembers them. 

553
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,833
 No, 

554
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:57,867
 is it that the body remembers but the mind doesn't? 

555
00:35:58,867 --> 00:36:03,633
 I'll remember someday. It doesn't matter. 

556
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:08,033
 Because I found someone who can't be compared to anything else. 

557
00:36:10,233 --> 00:36:11,600
 It's you. 

558
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:16,133
 My one and only first love. 

559
00:36:17,633 --> 00:36:19,067
 Lie. 

560
00:36:19,067 --> 00:36:20,600
 It's a blatant lie. 

561
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:23,500
 Dr. Kyeong hid the side effects. 

562
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:27,733
 Then all the clinical trials were fake? 

563
00:36:27,733 --> 00:36:30,300
 You call yourself a doctor? I'm disappointed. 

564
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:32,633
 What have you done to me? 

565
00:36:32,633 --> 00:36:34,100
 My first love memories 

566
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:36,667
 are ruined because of you. 

567
00:36:36,667 --> 00:36:39,733
 No, that's not it. 

568
00:36:39,733 --> 00:36:42,433
 No, that's not it. 

569
00:36:42,433 --> 00:36:44,667
No!

570
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,430
   ­ 

571
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:24,200
 ­  

572
00:37:27,050 --> 00:37:28,110
  ­ 

573
00:37:33,833 --> 00:37:35,033
You're amazing.

574
00:37:35,033 --> 00:37:37,467
I think you drank about 100 while filming. You're drinking it again?

575
00:37:37,467 --> 00:37:38,867
This is all free.

576
00:37:38,867 --> 00:37:41,167
It's kind of like 'anger income'.

577
00:37:41,167 --> 00:37:42,433
It's 'unearned income.'

578
00:37:42,433 --> 00:37:43,900
It's anger income.

579
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:46,733
It's unearned… anger.

580
00:37:46,733 --> 00:37:49,767
You speak so confidently that even I am confused.

581
00:37:49,767 --> 00:37:51,467
By the way, did you come alone today?

582
00:37:51,467 --> 00:37:53,467
Who are you looking for?

583
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:55,933
There comes the person you're looking for.

584
00:37:55,933 --> 00:37:57,367
Where?

585
00:37:57,367 --> 00:37:59,467
You two were together.

586
00:37:59,467 --> 00:38:02,000
Our super sports star, Lee Shin.

587
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,500
National star Cha Si On.

588
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:07,767
I haven't seen you for a while, but lately I see you often.

589
00:38:07,767 --> 00:38:09,267
You are being cold.

590
00:38:09,267 --> 00:38:11,033
Our company's star is filming a commercial,

591
00:38:11,033 --> 00:38:13,800
so of course I have to come.

592
00:38:14,833 --> 00:38:17,067
You were joking last time when you said you weren't renewing your contract. Right?

593
00:38:17,067 --> 00:38:19,533
I got insomnia because you said you wouldn't renew the contract.

594
00:38:19,533 --> 00:38:23,900
I can't sleep because I'm worried that Shin is upset with me.

595
00:38:24,867 --> 00:38:28,233
Is it because of what I said to Lee Kun?

596
00:38:28,233 --> 00:38:31,100
That was loving advice.

597
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:32,600
I didn't think you two were really close.

598
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:34,433
I'm leaving.

599
00:38:37,967 --> 00:38:39,233
That rude little bastard.

600
00:38:39,233 --> 00:38:41,767
But did you come alone?

601
00:38:41,767 --> 00:38:43,100
Where's the manager?

602
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:44,733
Manager? Who?

603
00:38:44,733 --> 00:38:48,033
Oh, Lee Kun? He's sick.

604
00:38:48,033 --> 00:38:51,267
Last time, he spoke rudely to the national star and got punished.

605
00:38:51,267 --> 00:38:54,733
Oh, he's sick?

606
00:39:14,167 --> 00:39:16,067
I came to visit Lee Kun.

607
00:39:16,067 --> 00:39:18,000
Just a moment.

608
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:22,000
Oh, nobody is allowed to visit Mr. Lee.

609
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,267
Then he's in this hospital, right?

610
00:39:24,267 --> 00:39:26,400
He's 28 years old, with a very handsome face.

611
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:29,867
And he's the tall, sexy Lee Kun. Right?

612
00:39:29,867 --> 00:39:34,100
I am that handsome, tall and sexy Lee Kun.

613
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:35,367
Mister!

614
00:39:35,367 --> 00:39:37,367
Secretary, the hospital director is there. Right?

615
00:39:37,367 --> 00:39:39,767
Yes, I'll go up right now.

616
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:50,760
  ­ 

617
00:39:50,767 --> 00:39:53,300
Oh my, you scared me.

618
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:54,533
What are you doing here?

619
00:39:54,533 --> 00:39:55,567
Go out.

620
00:39:55,567 --> 00:39:56,967
Just once.

621
00:39:56,967 --> 00:39:59,167
Shh.

622
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:03,567
You see that thing in front of you there?

623
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:05,670
 ­  

624
00:40:09,167 --> 00:40:11,133
Security will be here soon.

625
00:40:11,133 --> 00:40:12,600
One.

626
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:13,900
Two.

627
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:16,200
Three.

628
00:40:22,133 --> 00:40:24,100
- Here, Nurse Song. 
 - No, wait a minute.

629
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:26,067
Shh, just once!

630
00:40:26,067 --> 00:40:27,133
Nurse Song!

631
00:40:27,133 --> 00:40:29,867
Just once, just once.

632
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:36,900
Oppa!

633
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:42,000
Oppa!

634
00:40:43,067 --> 00:40:45,333
Oppa!

635
00:40:47,667 --> 00:40:49,267
Let's not do this.

636
00:40:49,267 --> 00:40:51,000
- Oppa! 
 - Wait a minute.

637
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,600
Doctor, what's happening…

638
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:56,367
Nurse Song, please calm this down here.

639
00:40:56,367 --> 00:40:57,833
Calm down?

640
00:40:57,833 --> 00:40:59,433
Folding hands.

641
00:40:59,433 --> 00:41:01,733
- Let's keep folding our hands. 
 - Hello.

642
00:41:01,733 --> 00:41:03,867
She's my fan.

643
00:41:03,867 --> 00:41:05,733
Yes, she's my fan.

644
00:41:05,733 --> 00:41:07,467
You know me, right? I'm Lee Shin.

645
00:41:07,467 --> 00:41:08,900
Look at the bracelet, the bracelet.

646
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:11,800
Yes, it's not a scandal.

647
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:14,067
- Oppa, Oppa. 
 - Look at the bracelet.

648
00:41:14,067 --> 00:41:15,933
Oppa, Oppa!

649
00:41:15,933 --> 00:41:18,733
- Folding hands. 
 - Folding hands.

650
00:41:18,733 --> 00:41:20,833
More… more? More?

651
00:41:20,833 --> 00:41:22,233
Are we going to keep doing this forever?

652
00:41:22,233 --> 00:41:24,967
Oh, folding hands…

653
00:41:30,633 --> 00:41:32,100
You're my fan?

654
00:41:32,100 --> 00:41:36,000
Of course I know Cha Shi On. You were a rising star 2 years ago.

655
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,700
Now you are just a girl in a constipation commercial.

656
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:40,933
I admit it.

657
00:41:40,933 --> 00:41:43,100
I admit it coolly.

658
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:45,267
If you don't remember meeting me,

659
00:41:45,267 --> 00:41:48,600
you probably won't remember seeing my data. Right?

660
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:50,667
- Data? 
 - At that time.

661
00:41:50,667 --> 00:41:55,633
You looked at my data and told me to be careful of injuries.

662
00:41:56,467 --> 00:41:58,633
Big data is not just a record,

663
00:41:58,633 --> 00:42:00,067
but a sophisticated scientific result.

664
00:42:00,067 --> 00:42:04,067
A thousand pieces of data per second, 400 types of data collected,

665
00:42:04,067 --> 00:42:05,800
the way the direction of movement changes during the game,

666
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:09,667
instantaneous acceleration, muscle explosiveness

667
00:42:09,667 --> 00:42:12,433
according to movement, power control,

668
00:42:12,433 --> 00:42:14,533
all of this data can be analyzed to predict injuries.

669
00:42:14,533 --> 00:42:18,233
Of course, only an athletic genius like me can see it.

670
00:42:18,233 --> 00:42:19,433
You are my style.

671
00:42:19,433 --> 00:42:22,533
You little girl…

672
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:26,533
I'm everyone's style.

673
00:42:27,967 --> 00:42:29,567
My popularity is…

674
00:42:29,567 --> 00:42:33,800
I don't have a private life, but I must bear the weight of the crown.

675
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:35,567
It's something like that.

676
00:42:35,567 --> 00:42:37,867
Isn't it so?

677
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:41,867
- I'm your fan. 
 - Please give me an autograph.

678
00:42:41,867 --> 00:42:45,440
Your appearance is cute, and your signature is cute too.

679
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:48,820
 ­You play tennis really well. 

680
00:42:49,933 --> 00:42:51,967
This is a gift for you.

681
00:42:53,767 --> 00:42:55,133
It's a new product.

682
00:42:55,133 --> 00:42:58,233
It's sponsored, so don't feel pressured.

683
00:42:58,233 --> 00:43:02,200
Even so, I'm a big-hearted high school student who makes a lot of money.

684
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:05,200
Actually, I was a bit surprised that day.

685
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:08,233
The day you said you would retire and become Shin's manager.

686
00:43:08,233 --> 00:43:13,100
You were the first Korean to win the World Junior Championships.

687
00:43:13,100 --> 00:43:18,467
But why did you lose the medal?

688
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:21,167
A medal?

689
00:43:22,467 --> 00:43:25,433
Did… Did I lose my medal?

690
00:43:25,433 --> 00:43:27,067
 Did you lose your medal? 

691
00:43:27,067 --> 00:43:29,900
 I dropped my medal. 

692
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:36,733
Why? Are you feeling bad?

693
00:43:36,733 --> 00:43:37,933
Mister.

694
00:43:37,933 --> 00:43:40,400
 Mom! 

695
00:43:41,933 --> 00:43:44,533
 Open your eyes. 

696
00:43:52,133 --> 00:43:53,333
 My medal. 

697
00:43:53,333 --> 00:43:55,200
Wait.

698
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:56,767
 Kun! 

699
00:43:56,767 --> 00:43:58,533
Mister.

700
00:43:58,533 --> 00:44:00,833
Mister!

701
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:07,500
Somebody, please help him.

702
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:09,000
- Are you okay? 
 - Are you okay?

703
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,400
Are you okay?

704
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:12,833
Are you all right?

705
00:44:18,667 --> 00:44:21,100
Yes, it's Kyeong Ju Yeon.

706
00:44:23,067 --> 00:44:25,433
Yes, I'll go right away.

707
00:44:26,580 --> 00:44:28,750
 ­  

708
00:44:31,700 --> 00:44:33,800
Ugh.

709
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:36,067
This is driving me crazy.

710
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:46,133
   

711
00:44:46,133 --> 00:44:50,100
How's Kun?

712
00:44:50,100 --> 00:44:51,867
He's still…

713
00:44:51,867 --> 00:44:53,433
Where is his guardian?

714
00:44:53,433 --> 00:44:58,400
His mother asked me to come quickly. I am his friend.

715
00:44:59,367 --> 00:45:02,400
If only I hadn't asked him to go to the alumni reunion…

716
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:04,700
Alumni reunion?

717
00:45:05,267 --> 00:45:07,467
He kept insisting that he wouldn't come,

718
00:45:07,467 --> 00:45:09,800
but for some reason, he suddenly came.

719
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:11,367
 My medal, my medal. 

720
00:45:11,367 --> 00:45:14,267
 - Excuse me. 
 - Wait a minute 

721
00:45:14,267 --> 00:45:16,633
 Where did the person who won this medal go? 

722
00:45:16,633 --> 00:45:18,233
 She went out a little while ago. 

723
00:45:18,233 --> 00:45:20,567
 Oh, there! 

724
00:45:32,267 --> 00:45:33,633
 The person 

725
00:45:33,633 --> 00:45:36,433
 who opened my eyes to the world again. 

726
00:45:36,433 --> 00:45:39,333
 The only one who reached out to me 

727
00:45:39,333 --> 00:45:42,900
 when everyone else turned their backs on me. 

728
00:45:43,467 --> 00:45:46,233
 She's the reason I am alive. 

729
00:45:46,233 --> 00:45:48,800
 And she is alive. 

730
00:45:49,733 --> 00:45:53,400
 Thank you for being alive. 

731
00:46:20,333 --> 00:46:21,900
 Hey! Where are you? 

732
00:46:21,900 --> 00:46:23,933
 Have you found your first love? 

733
00:46:23,933 --> 00:46:25,800
 Yeah, I found her. 

734
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:27,267
 Thankfully. 

735
00:46:27,267 --> 00:46:29,533
 Hey, did you pretend to know her? 

736
00:46:29,533 --> 00:46:30,967
 Hey, you should have confessed to her. 

737
00:46:30,967 --> 00:46:33,967
 I shouldn't have anything more to wish for. 

738
00:46:34,900 --> 00:46:36,800
 That's how it should be. 

739
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:41,300
 But she was already with someone else. 

740
00:46:44,233 --> 00:46:46,167
 It was taken away again. 

741
00:46:46,167 --> 00:46:48,900
 What do you mean by that? 

742
00:46:48,900 --> 00:46:50,967
 Who took it away? 

743
00:46:55,467 --> 00:46:57,600
 Lee Shin. 

744
00:46:57,600 --> 00:46:59,300
That day.

745
00:46:59,300 --> 00:47:04,933
I heard that he lost his first love to someone really close to him there.

746
00:47:05,867 --> 00:47:10,633
He had lost everything since he stopped playing tennis, and again…

747
00:47:11,320 --> 00:47:13,200
 ­If only... 

748
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:17,700
 So his first love became a bad memory? 

749
00:47:44,067 --> 00:47:46,800
Isn't it weird?

750
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:50,867
A mother who doesn't shed a single tear in this situation.

751
00:47:51,633 --> 00:47:54,300
I look like a stepmother, right?

752
00:47:54,300 --> 00:47:57,800
I've never cried in front of the kids.

753
00:47:59,033 --> 00:48:00,967
No.

754
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:06,033
I don't think I've cried since that day.

755
00:48:07,767 --> 00:48:12,233
The day I left my child behind after hearingthat he couldn't play tennis anymore.

756
00:48:12,233 --> 00:48:14,567
I promised myself that day.

757
00:48:14,567 --> 00:48:16,433
 Mom! 

758
00:48:16,433 --> 00:48:18,667
 Mom! 

759
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:24,267
 Mom, take me too! 

760
00:48:26,567 --> 00:48:29,700
If I break down in front of my kids,

761
00:48:29,700 --> 00:48:33,233
they will become like me.

762
00:48:33,233 --> 00:48:36,667
I'm also a former athlete.

763
00:48:36,667 --> 00:48:40,533
I thought I had to raise them strong.

764
00:48:41,833 --> 00:48:45,500
It looks like I became a bloodless, tearless mother.

765
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:54,567
The night the accident happened,

766
00:48:55,467 --> 00:48:58,233
Kun said something to me.

767
00:48:58,233 --> 00:49:00,800
 - It's the best, the best. 
 - Add sesame oil and mix it well. 

768
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:02,433
 I'll do that. 

769
00:49:02,433 --> 00:49:04,867
 This goes best with rice. 

770
00:49:04,867 --> 00:49:08,133
 But the rice is cooked really well today. 

771
00:49:08,133 --> 00:49:09,467
 Eat more, Shin. 

772
00:49:09,467 --> 00:49:11,267
 This sauce is… 

773
00:49:11,267 --> 00:49:13,900
 You came back at a good time. 

774
00:49:13,900 --> 00:49:18,900
 Come now, Grandma sent you some soy sauce marinated crab to eat. 

775
00:49:19,833 --> 00:49:21,767
 There are more of these, right? 

776
00:49:21,767 --> 00:49:25,200
 If it goes so well with rice, it's the best. 

777
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:29,000
 I'll tell Grandma to send it again. 

778
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:30,033
 It's good. 

779
00:49:30,033 --> 00:49:32,167
 Yeah, it's full. 

780
00:49:32,167 --> 00:49:34,467
 Here. 

781
00:49:41,533 --> 00:49:43,867
 Yeah, eat this. 

782
00:49:44,500 --> 00:49:46,900
 Here, Shin. Eat this. 

783
00:49:47,867 --> 00:49:50,367
 My grandmother sent this to me. 

784
00:49:50,367 --> 00:49:52,533
 Because I like it. 

785
00:49:53,900 --> 00:49:55,900
 To put it that way, 

786
00:49:55,900 --> 00:49:57,500
 the rest of the food was bought with money 

787
00:49:57,500 --> 00:50:02,967
 earned from playing tennis until your brother got blisters on his feet. 

788
00:50:02,967 --> 00:50:04,800
 The spoon you are holding, 

789
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:09,133
 the chair you are sitting on, the ground you are walking on are all Shin's. 

790
00:50:09,133 --> 00:50:12,567
 Why are you suddenly being like this about Grandma's food? 

791
00:50:12,567 --> 00:50:14,300
 Yeah, Kun. 

792
00:50:14,300 --> 00:50:17,633
 Shin is trying to control his diet these days, so he can't even eat properly. 

793
00:50:17,633 --> 00:50:20,100
 We have to support him. 

794
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:23,067
 Why are you doing this all of a sudden, you've never said anything before? 

795
00:50:23,967 --> 00:50:27,100
 It's mine. Don't touch it! 

796
00:50:28,100 --> 00:50:30,433
 It's mine. 

797
00:50:33,433 --> 00:50:35,633
 Do you feel like it's a waste for your younger brother to eat? 

798
00:50:35,633 --> 00:50:39,800
 Why do you get greedy for no reason when you live doing nothing? 

799
00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:43,067
 If you have that kind of greed, you can live greedily every day. 

800
00:50:43,067 --> 00:50:47,000
 How come you've been living like a reckless person since you got hurt? 

801
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:48,667
 How long has it been? 

802
00:50:48,667 --> 00:50:51,533
 Oh, stop now, please. 

803
00:50:52,300 --> 00:50:54,433
 How hard must it be for Kun? 

804
00:50:54,433 --> 00:50:56,667
 He's already 

805
00:50:56,667 --> 00:50:59,533
 falling behind his younger brother. 

806
00:50:59,533 --> 00:51:01,300
 This kid. 

807
00:51:01,300 --> 00:51:05,600
 You can't even make a livingwithout your younger brother. 

808
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:11,600
 I'm also your son. 

809
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:14,667
 Don't call me like that. 

810
00:51:14,667 --> 00:51:17,667
 I'm also the son of this family. 

811
00:51:17,667 --> 00:51:22,233
 Why is Shin "my kid" and I'm "this kid"? 

812
00:51:23,267 --> 00:51:27,300
 I can have at least one thing! 

813
00:51:27,300 --> 00:51:31,200
 Even just one thing can be mine. 

814
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:34,733
 Do you know what I have in my bag all year round? 

815
00:51:36,133 --> 00:51:38,633
 It's an umbrella. 

816
00:51:38,633 --> 00:51:42,667
 Because there's no one to bring it to me even if it rains. 

817
00:51:42,667 --> 00:51:45,800
 You went to see Shin who was training day and night… 

818
00:51:45,800 --> 00:51:48,667
 Have you ever been with me 

819
00:51:48,667 --> 00:51:53,000
 for my entrance ceremony, graduation ceremony, or birthday? 

820
00:51:53,733 --> 00:51:56,367
 Do you know why I don't go out? 

821
00:51:56,367 --> 00:51:58,900
 My body is… 

822
00:51:58,900 --> 00:52:02,200
 Because my body is not my body. 

823
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,300
 Even when I was bullied in school, 

824
00:52:05,300 --> 00:52:08,700
 I got hit. Do you know why? 

825
00:52:09,467 --> 00:52:11,667
 Because I'm Lee Shin's elder brother. 

826
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:15,333
 If I hit them, my brother will suffer. 

827
00:52:15,333 --> 00:52:18,633
 People compare me to Shin even when I breathe. 

828
00:52:18,633 --> 00:52:22,433
 We're brothers, but he has everything and I have nothing. 

829
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:26,167
 Everything I had was taken away. 

830
00:52:26,167 --> 00:52:29,000
 Parents, friends… 

831
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:34,267
 Anyone… 

832
00:52:36,833 --> 00:52:38,733
 If only I could erase the memories 

833
00:52:38,733 --> 00:52:42,733
 of the day I had the accident, I would sell my… 

834
00:52:42,733 --> 00:52:46,200
 I would sell my soul, but 

835
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:48,367
 it won't work. 

836
00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:54,433
 Because I can never... 

837
00:52:56,633 --> 00:52:59,167
 be the main character. 

838
00:52:59,867 --> 00:53:02,267
 Lee Shin. 

839
00:53:03,833 --> 00:53:07,200
 Because I have to live as a supporting role to my younger brother. 

840
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:09,400
 You. 

841
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:13,500
 How can you talk to your mom like that? 

842
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,100
 Mom? 

843
00:53:21,167 --> 00:53:24,700
 You've never been 'Lee Kun's mom'. 

844
00:53:35,833 --> 00:53:38,630
I thought, no matter how immature he was,

845
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:42,267
how could he say something like that?

846
00:53:46,867 --> 00:53:49,400
But when I thought about it,

847
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:54,100
I realized that I really never had been Kun's mother.

848
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:03,233
How fortunate it is that

849
00:54:03,233 --> 00:54:06,533
he has now lost even that memory.

850
00:54:06,533 --> 00:54:09,433
I have a chance to live...

851
00:54:10,300 --> 00:54:15,800
as Kun's mother again.

852
00:54:54,833 --> 00:54:58,633
   

853
00:54:58,633 --> 00:55:02,967
 Which is the right choice for the patient? 

854
00:55:02,967 --> 00:55:07,233
 I would sell my soul to you if only I could forget it. 

855
00:55:08,367 --> 00:55:11,533
 Am I making his sacrifice in vain? 

856
00:55:12,367 --> 00:55:15,100
 I was desperately 

857
00:55:15,100 --> 00:55:17,300
 looking for you… 

858
00:55:20,700 --> 00:55:22,933
 Who's your mother-in-law? Did you have a dream? 

859
00:55:22,933 --> 00:55:24,233
 Yes, I dreamed. 

860
00:55:24,233 --> 00:55:27,033
 I had a dream that I have to get married when I find my first love. 

861
00:55:27,033 --> 00:55:30,900
 You still don't remember me? 

862
00:55:30,900 --> 00:55:32,733
 You don't have to remember me. 

863
00:55:32,733 --> 00:55:35,267
 Because I remember you. 

864
00:55:35,267 --> 00:55:38,500
 What if even good memories turn into bad memories? 

865
00:55:39,433 --> 00:55:42,000
 Will you take responsibility? 

866
00:56:13,033 --> 00:56:15,200
Lee Shin.

867
00:57:14,067 --> 00:57:16,900
Seriously, why am I like this?

868
00:57:37,733 --> 00:57:40,867
Oh my.

869
00:57:43,900 --> 00:57:47,733
Ah, is it because the wind is cold?

870
00:57:48,933 --> 00:57:53,667
Why doesn't that work? Why doesn't the ball come out?

871
00:57:54,667 --> 00:57:57,533
Are you embarrassed? For crying?

872
00:58:01,700 --> 00:58:05,067
I'm going to lose all my charm.

873
00:58:05,067 --> 00:58:08,800
I was in the midst of appealing to you about my charms…

874
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:11,900
You don't have to joke.

875
00:58:13,300 --> 00:58:15,867
I just keep tearing up.

876
00:58:20,167 --> 00:58:22,233
I guess...

877
00:58:23,100 --> 00:58:26,233
I've been missing tennis for a while now.

878
00:58:27,133 --> 00:58:28,667
I felt empty

879
00:58:28,667 --> 00:58:31,933
the whole time after waking up.

880
00:58:31,933 --> 00:58:37,967
Is it because I haven't been able to play tennis for a while?

881
00:58:37,967 --> 00:58:39,533
Whether it's exercise or love,

882
00:58:39,533 --> 00:58:43,167
you can do it again now.

883
00:59:01,500 --> 00:59:03,733
Right hand…

884
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:09,267
 This man. 

885
00:59:09,267 --> 00:59:13,600
 He finally erased the pain he had been trying to forget for 15 years. 

886
00:59:13,600 --> 00:59:16,633
 I shouldn't take it out again. 

887
00:59:16,633 --> 00:59:19,133
Can I…

888
00:59:19,133 --> 00:59:22,967
regain my lost memories?

889
00:59:22,967 --> 00:59:25,467
It's okay if you don't remember.

890
00:59:26,333 --> 00:59:27,667
Because I do.

891
00:59:27,667 --> 00:59:31,067
 I first had the arrogant thought as a doctor 

892
00:59:31,067 --> 00:59:34,167
 that I might be able to heal him… 

893
00:59:34,167 --> 00:59:36,333
That's right.

894
00:59:36,333 --> 00:59:40,300
I'm your first love.

895
00:59:42,233 --> 00:59:44,833
 I didn't know it then. 

896
00:59:46,667 --> 00:59:49,230
    
 I came from Yongshin police station.

897
00:59:50,033 --> 00:59:54,700
 Arrogance will eventually cause trouble. 

898
01:00:02,480 --> 01:00:12,800


899
01:00:17,500 --> 01:00:27,070
♫  Drowning, drowning in an ocean of grey  ♫

900
01:00:29,010 --> 01:00:36,660
♫  Running, running backwards to you  ♫

901
01:00:36,667 --> 01:00:41,600
   

902
01:00:41,600 --> 01:00:43,767
 I feel like a fraud. 

903
01:00:43,767 --> 01:00:45,100
 I need to tell him clearly. 

904
01:00:45,100 --> 01:00:46,733
 Please pick up the ball. That's an important ball. 

905
01:00:46,733 --> 01:00:48,633
 That's kind of a jinx for sports people. 

906
01:00:48,633 --> 01:00:50,667
 Isn't this just an obsession disguised as a jinx? 

907
01:00:50,667 --> 01:00:53,400
 The side effects of the surgery are a secret between you and me. 

908
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:56,000
 You look so pretty that I want to protect you. 

909
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:59,300
 It would be impossible to save someone who fell from a bridge in such a short time. 

910
01:00:59,300 --> 01:01:02,233
 You're not using this incident as an excuse to renew the contract. Right? 

911
01:01:02,233 --> 01:01:04,900
 He doesn't have any trauma, but he's getting psychiatric counseling… 

912
01:01:04,900 --> 01:01:07,133
 Why did he jump into the water again? 

913
01:01:07,133 --> 01:01:09,367
 Everything is good, but your eyesight is worse than I thought. 

914
01:01:09,367 --> 01:01:11,433
 You are no longer the past. 

915
01:01:11,433 --> 01:01:14,833
 You are in the present.
