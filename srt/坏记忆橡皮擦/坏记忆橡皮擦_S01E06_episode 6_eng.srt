1
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:07,860
 Kim Jae Joong 

2
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:14,380
 Jin Se Yeon 

3
00:00:16,130 --> 00:00:18,080
 Lee Jong Won 

4
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:22,830
 Yang Hye Ji 

5
00:00:25,433 --> 00:00:33,300
   

6
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:39,367
   

7
00:00:39,967 --> 00:00:43,533
First, promise to never see me as a woman.

8
00:00:43,533 --> 00:00:46,700
Second, we must respect each other's privacy outside of working hours.

9
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:49,767
Third, you should undergo a brainwave test and detailed consultation once a week.

10
00:00:49,767 --> 00:00:52,267
Fourth, you don't have to provide the four major insurances and salary.

11
00:00:52,267 --> 00:00:56,067
Just provide room and board for exactly three months.

12
00:00:56,067 --> 00:00:58,900
Please read the rest as well.

13
00:01:01,933 --> 00:01:06,933
I'm making a big decision by accepting the offer to be the team doctor.

14
00:01:06,933 --> 00:01:11,033
Normally, I should just write a standard contract, negotiate, and just get it done.

15
00:01:11,033 --> 00:01:14,300
I just have written down some compromises so—

16
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:21,120


17
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:23,100
Why…

18
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:26,267
If there's a part of the terms you don't like,

19
00:01:26,267 --> 00:01:29,600
we can make concessions and modify it.

20
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,133
There's no need for modifications.

21
00:01:31,133 --> 00:01:32,967
Because I'm not going to sign the contract.

22
00:01:32,967 --> 00:01:35,433
If you're done talking, please leave.

23
00:01:35,433 --> 00:01:36,767
Just a moment.

24
00:01:36,767 --> 00:01:38,133
Why?

25
00:01:38,133 --> 00:01:40,000
You introduced me as the team doctor in front of the investors,

26
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,800
and now you're saying you won't sign the contract?

27
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:46,833
Because my mindset has changed since then.

28
00:01:46,833 --> 00:01:49,900
Back then, I liked you,

29
00:01:51,067 --> 00:01:53,367
but not anymore.

30
00:02:00,467 --> 00:02:02,233
That's good, then.

31
00:02:02,233 --> 00:02:05,200
You shouldn't have feelings for someone you met through work.

32
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,000
I'm so relieved.

33
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,200
Now I can focus only on work.

34
00:02:11,933 --> 00:02:14,300
I have a lot of work.

35
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:16,100
Please leave.

36
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:18,433
But you said the team needed a doctor.

37
00:02:18,433 --> 00:02:21,267
I got permission to take time off from the hospital.

38
00:02:21,267 --> 00:02:23,667
Please leave.

39
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:28,033
You're kicking me out at this hour? My phone battery is dead.

40
00:02:28,033 --> 00:02:29,967
I can't leave now.

41
00:02:29,967 --> 00:02:33,167
Please understand that this is skinship due to a home invasion.

42
00:02:33,167 --> 00:02:35,667
Oh my.

43
00:02:50,133 --> 00:02:53,000
Since I drank a glass of wine earlier,

44
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,967
I can't even give you a ride now.

45
00:02:54,967 --> 00:02:58,133
No, I have no reason to take you home.

46
00:02:58,133 --> 00:03:01,533
Charge your phone in the guest room and go home on your own.

47
00:03:01,533 --> 00:03:04,833
Then could I borrow a charger...

48
00:03:04,833 --> 00:03:05,800
Figure it out yourself.

49
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:08,667
Oh, yes, I will.

50
00:03:36,233 --> 00:03:39,200
 The test subject has been discharged. 

51
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,633
 Discharged? 

52
00:03:47,533 --> 00:03:50,167
 But the hospital director said that even outside the hospital, 

53
00:03:50,167 --> 00:03:53,667
 I should observe the test subject, and gave me time off from my hospital duties. 

54
00:03:53,667 --> 00:03:57,700
 Thanks to that, the work is going on without any hitches. 

55
00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:01,567
 So, it would be better to observe his everyday behavior 

56
00:04:01,567 --> 00:04:05,000
 naturally outside rather than in a hospital. 

57
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,100
 Yes. 

58
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,467
 It's quite scary, isn't it? 

59
00:04:10,467 --> 00:04:12,767
 That pufferfish poison. 

60
00:04:12,767 --> 00:04:16,300
 It's said to be about ten times as potent as cyanide. 

61
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:17,633
 They're born without poison, 

62
00:04:17,633 --> 00:04:20,833
 and are weak with tiny fins, 

63
00:04:20,833 --> 00:04:23,133
 but they eat poisonous food 

64
00:04:23,133 --> 00:04:25,867
 to protect themselves 

65
00:04:25,867 --> 00:04:29,633
 and to survive in the jungle. 

66
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,967
 That's frightening. 

67
00:04:38,967 --> 00:04:42,433
 Don't worry, and just drink. 

68
00:04:50,433 --> 00:04:53,000
If we want to protect the subject,

69
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
we have to become even stronger.

70
00:04:57,167 --> 00:04:59,667
Gosh, that startled me.

71
00:04:59,667 --> 00:05:01,067
This darn weather.

72
00:05:01,067 --> 00:05:02,767
Oh my, I'm freezing.

73
00:05:02,767 --> 00:05:08,200
   

74
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:10,633
 I love myself. 

75
00:05:10,633 --> 00:05:14,433
 All the people in the world love me. 

76
00:05:14,433 --> 00:05:17,700
 The universe revolves around me. 

77
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:21,433
 Now, let's start the day fresh today as well. 

78
00:05:21,433 --> 00:05:23,200
 Concentrate on the breath coming in, 

79
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:26,167
 and concentrate on the breath going out. 

80
00:05:26,167 --> 00:05:30,533
 Three, two, one. 

81
00:05:34,133 --> 00:05:36,667
You are awake?

82
00:05:36,667 --> 00:05:38,900
What's this…

83
00:05:39,667 --> 00:05:41,867
I ordered delivery.

84
00:05:41,867 --> 00:05:45,100
I thought you left at dawn,

85
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:46,233
but you are even having breakfast?

86
00:05:46,233 --> 00:05:48,867
This is my true self.

87
00:05:48,867 --> 00:05:52,933
This is what I always look like at home, except when I go to work.

88
00:05:52,933 --> 00:05:54,967
Why are you doing this?

89
00:05:54,967 --> 00:05:56,767
You just have to not fall for me.

90
00:05:56,767 --> 00:05:58,467
You said I was impregnable like an iron wall, right? That's right.

91
00:05:58,467 --> 00:06:00,767
Just think of me as wearing a suit thicker than Iron Man's.

92
00:06:00,767 --> 00:06:03,233
I will ask you once again.

93
00:06:03,233 --> 00:06:05,467
What is your intention behind this?

94
00:06:05,467 --> 00:06:07,867
The intent.

95
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:10,033
 Because you are my patient. 

96
00:06:10,033 --> 00:06:11,400
 To take your side, 

97
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:14,100
 to be responsible till the end. 

98
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:21,067
Oh, you little cutie.

99
00:06:21,067 --> 00:06:23,267
Why are you calling at this hour?

100
00:06:24,567 --> 00:06:26,300
What?

101
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:28,533
What happened? Tell me properly.

102
00:06:28,533 --> 00:06:32,500
All right, I'll go to the rehab center now.

103
00:06:33,433 --> 00:06:37,200
Did something happen to one of your athletes?

104
00:06:38,067 --> 00:06:40,600
Yes?

105
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:44,567
I'm out. Let's go together.

106
00:06:44,567 --> 00:06:47,300
Let's go together.

107
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:50,767
Oh my.

108
00:06:50,767 --> 00:06:53,933
Oh my, where is he?

109
00:06:55,933 --> 00:06:58,700
Oh my.

110
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:10,133
Something happened to the athlete, right? This is when you need a team doctor.

111
00:07:10,133 --> 00:07:12,467
Let's go together.

112
00:07:12,467 --> 00:07:13,900
Oh my.

113
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:15,600
What are you doing?

114
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:18,200
What are you doing?

115
00:07:20,367 --> 00:07:22,400
Seriously, are you really going to do this?

116
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,767
Are you really leaving?

117
00:07:23,767 --> 00:07:26,933
Mr. Lee Kun! Mr. Lee Kun!

118
00:07:26,933 --> 00:07:29,533
Hey!

119
00:07:38,467 --> 00:07:40,900
Thank you.

120
00:07:43,567 --> 00:07:45,867
Oh, you startled me.

121
00:07:45,867 --> 00:07:48,433
Ma'am.

122
00:07:48,433 --> 00:07:51,100
Why are you out here so early in the morning?

123
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:52,833
It's still cold outside.

124
00:07:52,833 --> 00:07:55,700
Well, Ju Yeon hasn't come back yet.

125
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:57,467
Oh, l envy her.

126
00:07:57,467 --> 00:08:00,900
She must be relieved to have her mom so worried about her.

127
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:02,767
Are you jealous of her?

128
00:08:02,767 --> 00:08:05,633
Should I treat you like Ju Yeon?

129
00:08:05,633 --> 00:08:07,433
Really?

130
00:08:07,433 --> 00:08:08,967
Then that'd be so good.

131
00:08:08,967 --> 00:08:12,200
This is the Korean style. It's affection.

132
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,233
Then I would feel relieved, too.

133
00:08:14,233 --> 00:08:16,333
Seung Hyun, go inside.

134
00:08:16,333 --> 00:08:18,467
Hurry up.

135
00:08:18,967 --> 00:08:21,067
Yes.

136
00:08:25,733 --> 00:08:28,600
I treated you well because you were my friend's daughter.

137
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,933
You stayed out all night without saying anything?

138
00:08:30,933 --> 00:08:32,567
Oh my, oh my, ma'am.

139
00:08:32,567 --> 00:08:34,133
Do you think this place is a guesthouse?

140
00:08:34,133 --> 00:08:37,233
Coming and going whenever you want!

141
00:08:37,233 --> 00:08:39,933
If you're going to do that, leave right now!

142
00:08:39,933 --> 00:08:41,800
- Why are you doing this? Please calm down. 
 - What?

143
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:44,767
Yesterday, you brought sweet potatoes, and today you brought potatoes?

144
00:08:44,767 --> 00:08:47,200
What are you doing outside?

145
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,033
You.

146
00:08:49,033 --> 00:08:53,633
When I called your mom, she didn't even know you were here.

147
00:08:53,633 --> 00:08:55,300
Did you contact my mom?

148
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:59,900
You came to Korea and stayed out all night without saying anything?

149
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:01,967
If you stay out once more!

150
00:09:01,967 --> 00:09:04,900
I'll kick you out immediately.

151
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:10,200
I'm sorry.

152
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:14,367
Darn it.

153
00:09:14,367 --> 00:09:17,700
I wonder if my mom told dad.

154
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:29,700
Are you surprised? Don't you know how fast taxis are?

155
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:31,067
Okay, I'll leave.

156
00:09:31,067 --> 00:09:34,500
However, if I lose the bet, I'll leave.

157
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:38,367
- A bet? 
 - Let the athlete have the deciding power.

158
00:09:38,367 --> 00:09:40,667
If your athlete says she doesn't like me,

159
00:09:40,667 --> 00:09:42,700
I won't bother you any further and will leave.

160
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:45,767
I never lose a bet.

161
00:09:45,767 --> 00:09:48,400
So, are you down?

162
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:49,533
What if the athlete says no?

163
00:09:49,533 --> 00:09:50,933
I'll leave without saying anything.

164
00:09:50,933 --> 00:09:53,133
However, never change…

165
00:09:53,133 --> 00:09:56,100
A deal is a deal.

166
00:09:57,167 --> 00:09:59,833
Who's the athlete?

167
00:10:00,867 --> 00:10:06,233
I said I'm not doing it. I said I'm not doing rehab.

168
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:22,600
  ­ 

169
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:26,133
I'm Psychiatrist Kyeong Ju Yeon from the agency.

170
00:10:26,133 --> 00:10:29,167
I came to help you.

171
00:10:32,967 --> 00:10:35,233
Miss Si On.

172
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:39,667
Shall we sit down calmly and talk?

173
00:10:39,667 --> 00:10:43,000
    
 I'm Lee Kun. You are Si On's mother, right?

174
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,233
Little cutie is…

175
00:10:45,233 --> 00:10:48,900
I was late in greeting you because Si On said you were overseas.

176
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:53,433
Does it make any sense to be excluded from the national team candidacy?

177
00:10:53,433 --> 00:10:55,833
You said you were a former player.

178
00:10:55,833 --> 00:10:58,367
Don't you know better than anyone that it's not often that you get the chance

179
00:10:58,367 --> 00:11:00,000
to go to an international competition

180
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,700
as a national representative?

181
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:05,533
Since the knee injury won't be a problem by the end of the national team game,

182
00:11:05,533 --> 00:11:10,867
if she wants, I'll appeal to the association and get her tested.

183
00:11:10,867 --> 00:11:15,200
I already made her take all the tests. Oh my.

184
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,433
Please don't worry too much and just trust me and wait.

185
00:11:18,433 --> 00:11:21,633
I will resolve things well with the association.

186
00:11:21,633 --> 00:11:23,000
Let's go.

187
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:23,933
Oh, Si On's mother.

188
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:27,267
You know that a contract without the guardian's consent is void. Right?

189
00:11:27,267 --> 00:11:29,400
Let's go.

190
00:11:33,533 --> 00:11:38,600
Have a drink of something nice. What kind of business card is this?

191
00:11:39,767 --> 00:11:45,167
Could you tell me about your emotion that's making you cry now?

192
00:11:47,367 --> 00:11:48,500
Why?

193
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:51,667
Think of me as a human diary, and if you tell me everything,

194
00:11:51,667 --> 00:11:53,567
you'll feel relieved.

195
00:11:53,567 --> 00:11:55,700
A human diary?

196
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:58,333
Shall I tell you about the last diary I wrote?

197
00:11:58,333 --> 00:12:00,033
Title, love game.

198
00:12:00,033 --> 00:12:03,767
I made an unforced error by missing a down-the-line shot at a breakpoint one.

199
00:12:03,767 --> 00:12:06,467
After that, I only missed passing shots, angle shots, and drop shots,

200
00:12:06,467 --> 00:12:07,933
but then I lost the set and started to collapse,

201
00:12:07,933 --> 00:12:11,200
breaking the history of my love game.

202
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,800
I was in the top tier of the ITF,

203
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,367
but then started to fall behind in the KTA,

204
00:12:14,367 --> 00:12:17,800
and now, I can't make it to the national team.

205
00:12:18,867 --> 00:12:21,600
Do you understand what I'm saying?

206
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:27,200
You're upset because you couldn't make it to the national team. Right?

207
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:31,433
You know what a love game is. Right?

208
00:12:32,067 --> 00:12:35,200
That's what they say when couples play tennis.

209
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,600
Right, that love game.

210
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:41,233
Yeah, I guess you're more upset because you lost to your boyfriend.

211
00:12:41,233 --> 00:12:44,267
From talking about boyfriends to fighting between players.

212
00:12:44,267 --> 00:12:47,267
Well, there can be discord within the team, too.

213
00:12:47,267 --> 00:12:51,467
I'll help you get through whatever it is.

214
00:12:51,467 --> 00:12:53,333
So, shall we start the consultation?

215
00:12:53,333 --> 00:12:56,200
But I don't have much time.

216
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:59,367
Maybe we can talk about it while we're rehabilitating together.

217
00:12:59,367 --> 00:13:03,667
Okay, well… What rehabilitation should we receive first?

218
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:17,267
Excuse me, Miss Si On.

219
00:13:17,267 --> 00:13:19,400
Miss Cha Si On!

220
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:21,667
You didn't leave, right?

221
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:27,433
I thought you left, Miss Si On.

222
00:13:27,433 --> 00:13:30,933
Did you become closer with Miss Si On?

223
00:13:30,933 --> 00:13:33,300
This is just the beginning.

224
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:35,833
Could you please let me down for now?

225
00:13:35,833 --> 00:13:39,000
Do you know what this position is called?

226
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,833
To me, it looks like a Superman pose.

227
00:13:40,833 --> 00:13:43,067
Stop talking nonsense and let me down now.

228
00:13:43,067 --> 00:13:46,700
I've never seen this before either. How do you do it?

229
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:49,167
I don't know how to use it.

230
00:13:49,167 --> 00:13:50,700
Is it done like this?

231
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:52,200
I feel dizzy, stop it, just stop.

232
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:55,500
Put me down now, and stop joking around.

233
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:58,200
Professor Han.

234
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:01,800
What brings you here at a non-consultation time?

235
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:04,400
Oh, it's good that you're here.

236
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:07,733
Could you and your family please persuade your brother?

237
00:14:07,733 --> 00:14:10,667
It's an emergency because he got discharged overnight.

238
00:14:10,667 --> 00:14:12,867
He doesn't listen to anyone.

239
00:14:12,867 --> 00:14:17,333
And I can't exactly say that he's in the middle of a clinical trial…

240
00:14:17,333 --> 00:14:21,200
Fortunately, he doesn't seem to dwell on the lost memories.

241
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:23,633
If memories of the past were to surface,

242
00:14:23,633 --> 00:14:26,333
we don't know what effect it might have on his brain circuits.

243
00:14:26,333 --> 00:14:31,567
If even a small memory comes to mind, it will come back like dominoes.

244
00:14:31,567 --> 00:14:34,300
Will he remember everything?

245
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:36,167
I guess so.

246
00:14:44,733 --> 00:14:46,600
Are you anxious?

247
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:48,300
What?

248
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:52,900
Are you anxious about your brother returning to his former self?

249
00:14:54,433 --> 00:14:57,600
Everyone is satisfied with the present.

250
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:03,667
You've been taking the medication regularly. Right?

251
00:15:03,667 --> 00:15:04,800
For panic disorder.

252
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,800
Yes.

253
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:09,967
It's not that I take medication because it's become a routine and I get anxious,

254
00:15:09,967 --> 00:15:12,500
but I get anxious when I don't take it.

255
00:15:13,267 --> 00:15:14,800
But more importantly,

256
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:19,600
it seems like today is Dr. Kyeong Ju Yeon's day off?

257
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,900
She is busy, so she's taking a break for now.

258
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:26,400
Huh? Why, why?

259
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:29,167
Just give me her contact information.

260
00:15:29,167 --> 00:15:31,033
- I have something to talk to her about. 
 - Huh?

261
00:15:31,033 --> 00:15:32,733
What are you going to do with it?

262
00:15:32,733 --> 00:15:35,167
Why do you need the medical staff's contact?

263
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:40,067
I just thought we could grab a meal together.

264
00:15:40,067 --> 00:15:42,867
Then would you like to eat with me? That's great.

265
00:15:42,867 --> 00:15:45,567
Today, I mean, actually today…

266
00:15:45,567 --> 00:15:47,833
Goodbye, I'll get going.

267
00:15:56,667 --> 00:16:01,400
He's so clueless. I don't know how he can figure out what I'm thinking.

268
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:04,767
Ah, I should've asked for her number beforehand.

269
00:16:04,767 --> 00:16:06,867
I know her neighborhood, though.

270
00:16:06,867 --> 00:16:08,967
The neighborhood?

271
00:16:08,967 --> 00:16:11,033
Her neighborhood!

272
00:16:23,633 --> 00:16:26,033
It has been reported stolen.

273
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:30,967
Looks like Mom did tell Dad.

274
00:16:30,967 --> 00:16:34,233
Ms. Sae Yan, I'll just give you one of these.

275
00:16:34,233 --> 00:16:36,367
It's on the house!

276
00:16:37,033 --> 00:16:41,767
You're totally the country grandmother type. I mean you're full of affection.

277
00:16:41,767 --> 00:16:45,100
Ma'am, seriously!

278
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:46,100
Thank you so much.

279
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:51,333
Oh my, drink it slowly.

280
00:16:51,333 --> 00:16:56,033
Wow, you're really gulping it down.

281
00:16:56,033 --> 00:16:58,200
Is that a special skill?

282
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:00,500
Hey, you.

283
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:01,800
You, Lee Shin!

284
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,633
Are you a stalker? You followed me, right?

285
00:17:03,633 --> 00:17:06,767
No, I came here because I have stuff to do.

286
00:17:06,767 --> 00:17:09,633
Maybe you are the one who knew I'd come here and came here in advance.

287
00:17:09,633 --> 00:17:13,600
Why are you drinking a beer with my picture displayed on it?

288
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:16,200
Well, that's because,

289
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:21,467
after I finish drinking it, there is even this kind of fun.

290
00:17:21,467 --> 00:17:23,300
I wondered how you found me.

291
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:26,400
Did you come here after seeing the address I told you to send the bracelet to?

292
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:30,567
Why? Because I rejected you, do you still have feelings for me?

293
00:17:31,933 --> 00:17:36,600
We went on three dates and drank beer all the time, and then again?

294
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:39,600
My only memory of the Italian game tour is the beer tour.

295
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:43,867
Wow, you seem to remember it all so vividly.

296
00:17:43,867 --> 00:17:46,100
Get over me.

297
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:48,867
Since you hit me, this molar over here really hurts.

298
00:17:48,867 --> 00:17:50,767
That must be a wisdom tooth.

299
00:17:50,767 --> 00:17:53,300
So, can you stop your unrequited love for me?

300
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:56,200
If you keep doing this, I'll report it to the media.

301
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,467
No.

302
00:17:57,467 --> 00:18:02,033
Now that my dad knows I'm in Korea, there might be someone following me.

303
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:04,833
It would be better to be careful.

304
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:09,933
Unless you want to be quietly buried under the artificial turf of the tennis court.

305
00:18:09,933 --> 00:18:14,100
Since you'll never see me again, look whenever you want.

306
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:18,000
Let's never see each other again.

307
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,867
I want that too.

308
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,933
Oh my, they are exactly the same.

309
00:18:28,933 --> 00:18:31,500
Both the athlete and the CEO.

310
00:18:32,567 --> 00:18:34,400
You have had a hard time.

311
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:39,367
Well… you had an argument with the hospital director, too?

312
00:18:41,033 --> 00:18:43,867
I heard you didn't go against it, either.

313
00:18:43,867 --> 00:18:45,133
Well…

314
00:18:45,133 --> 00:18:49,033
That… I found out late too.

315
00:18:49,033 --> 00:18:53,400
The hospital director and Te Oh colluded and to our subject…

316
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:57,967
It's not that I couldn't refute it because I was afraid of the hospital director.

317
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:04,600
This is the test data examined by the neurosurgery department without our knowledge. Take a look.

318
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:12,133
By erasing bad memories,

319
00:19:12,133 --> 00:19:15,933
the medial prefrontal cortex was overactivated.

320
00:19:15,933 --> 00:19:19,233
Whenever questions related to the first love are asked,

321
00:19:19,233 --> 00:19:22,200
the results are inconsistent.

322
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:25,700
Does that mean his self-esteem went down every time I rejected him?

323
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:28,033
I'll keep an eye on the hospital.

324
00:19:28,033 --> 00:19:30,667
You manage the subject well.

325
00:19:30,667 --> 00:19:33,400
Does this mean they are going to do something to the subject?

326
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:37,200
No, of course, they won't go that far.

327
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:40,967
Under the pretext of a new surgical method rather than a simple clinical trial,

328
00:19:40,967 --> 00:19:45,600
how can we know what experiments the neurosurgery department will do?

329
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:49,167
I will protect my patient.

330
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,860
Oh my.

331
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:54,233
Oh?

332
00:19:55,267 --> 00:19:57,500
Now that I think about it, it's already…

333
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:00,633
Wow, time flies.

334
00:20:00,633 --> 00:20:03,367
Professor, do you have time today?

335
00:20:03,367 --> 00:20:05,900
Huh? Oh, yes, I do.

336
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:08,400
I mean, I don't have a wife or kids, so…

337
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,767
I have time!

338
00:20:09,767 --> 00:20:11,467
That's good.

339
00:20:11,467 --> 00:20:14,567
Then, please tell me some tips for counseling athletes.

340
00:20:14,567 --> 00:20:15,967
Like a know-how.

341
00:20:15,967 --> 00:20:18,300
- What? 
 - Yes.

342
00:20:29,533 --> 00:20:31,600
Figure it out yourself.

343
00:20:35,167 --> 00:20:37,033
I was startled.

344
00:20:37,033 --> 00:20:39,600
- It's today, right? 
 - Yes.

345
00:20:40,533 --> 00:20:42,433
Why are you giving her money?

346
00:20:42,433 --> 00:20:44,667
Are you planning to buy something?

347
00:20:44,667 --> 00:20:45,667
That's…

348
00:20:45,667 --> 00:20:47,933
Actually,

349
00:20:48,867 --> 00:20:53,533
I feel a bit strange saying this to you.

350
00:20:53,533 --> 00:20:57,033
Oh my, all right, enough.

351
00:20:57,033 --> 00:20:59,800
That's not even necessary.

352
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:03,033
We also need to take care of camaraderie.

353
00:21:03,033 --> 00:21:05,700
We decided to pool the money.

354
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:08,900
Because today is the day for the money pool payout.

355
00:21:09,567 --> 00:21:11,167
Oh my, why are you gathering it at this hour?

356
00:21:11,167 --> 00:21:13,267
Go and do your work!

357
00:21:13,267 --> 00:21:15,300
Ah, camaraderie?

358
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:19,333
I bluntly wrote that it was my birthday on SNS.

359
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:23,533
Dr. Song, do you have a phone charger?

360
00:21:23,533 --> 00:21:26,400
Ah, I don't have a charger.

361
00:21:33,733 --> 00:21:35,467
Dr. Te Oh!

362
00:21:35,467 --> 00:21:37,467
Dr. Te Oh, do you have a phone charger…

363
00:21:37,467 --> 00:21:40,133
No, it's okay.

364
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:46,000
 Be quiet. Be quiet. 

365
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,767
 I said be quiet. 

366
00:21:47,767 --> 00:21:50,100
Sit down, no, that's lying down.

367
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:54,100
Sit, like this, sit like this.

368
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:56,500
Turn around. Turn around.

369
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:58,500
Like this, turn around like this.

370
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:00,700
Can't you do this? Show me your hand.

371
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:02,767
Oh, you did it!

372
00:22:02,767 --> 00:22:06,600
Why do you keep stressing him out? He can't understand you.

373
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:09,433
He understood everything, but he's just pretending not to hear.

374
00:22:09,433 --> 00:22:11,867
Cola, you don't have to do such things.

375
00:22:11,867 --> 00:22:16,000
You at least can live freely the way you want to.

376
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:18,567
Oh, you startled me.

377
00:22:18,567 --> 00:22:20,567
Should I also tell you that you're cute?

378
00:22:20,567 --> 00:22:23,800
Why do you keep sitting on my lap?

379
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:26,033
Oh.

380
00:22:26,033 --> 00:22:29,100
Okay, today's menu is boiled pork.

381
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:31,733
I don't eat meat that's been boiled in water.

382
00:22:31,733 --> 00:22:32,900
Even now?

383
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:34,167
What?

384
00:22:34,167 --> 00:22:36,700
No, I know, I know.

385
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:39,633
I knew that already, so I prepared pork belly.

386
00:22:39,633 --> 00:22:40,800
Let's eat pork belly.

387
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:42,000
Okay, Dad.

388
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,900
- All right. 
 - All right.

389
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:45,467
All right, let's eat, let's eat.

390
00:22:45,467 --> 00:22:46,767
Thank you for the meal.

391
00:22:46,767 --> 00:22:49,033
Thank you for the meal.

392
00:22:49,833 --> 00:22:52,433
- It's delicious, right? 
 - Yes.

393
00:22:52,433 --> 00:22:56,100
You shouldn't stare when someone else is counting money or eating.

394
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:57,800
Cola,

395
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:00,100
you have gained too much weight recently.

396
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:04,700
Eat diet food later, okay?

397
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:07,333
Shin, did you hear about the national team coach?

398
00:23:07,333 --> 00:23:09,333
Ah, they said he's a foreigner.

399
00:23:09,333 --> 00:23:10,800
A foreigner?

400
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:13,733
Let's meet him together when you meet the general director.

401
00:23:13,733 --> 00:23:14,767
Why?

402
00:23:14,767 --> 00:23:17,533
Because you'll gain weight as soon as you enter the athletes' village.

403
00:23:17,533 --> 00:23:20,167
You should tell them in advance that you're managing your diet.

404
00:23:20,167 --> 00:23:22,533
I can't go chasing after you and keep watch.

405
00:23:22,533 --> 00:23:26,033
Ah, I know the experts would take care of it.

406
00:23:26,033 --> 00:23:30,933
But I'll contact the agency and tell them to do it right.

407
00:23:30,933 --> 00:23:32,867
Have your meal.

408
00:23:32,867 --> 00:23:33,900
Okay, I got it.

409
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:35,300
I'll eat the broccoli.

410
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:38,900
Yes, eat the spinach too.

411
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:42,267
You said you didn't eat meat that was boiled.

412
00:23:42,267 --> 00:23:44,467
You're eating well.

413
00:23:45,567 --> 00:23:48,067
I think I should go now.

414
00:23:48,067 --> 00:23:51,033
It's good that you are doing business,

415
00:23:51,033 --> 00:23:52,867
but do you really have to live there too?

416
00:23:52,867 --> 00:23:54,933
Would it be better if you went to work from here?

417
00:23:54,933 --> 00:23:59,500
Yeah, someone might think you've got a woman hidden in your office.

418
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:07,233
Ah, what are you talking about right now?

419
00:24:07,233 --> 00:24:09,767
Is now the time for me to fall for a woman?

420
00:24:09,767 --> 00:24:11,867
Why? Oh dear.

421
00:24:11,867 --> 00:24:14,067
In front of your first love then,

422
00:24:14,067 --> 00:24:18,533
you used to say, "Isn't she eating so lovely?"

423
00:24:18,533 --> 00:24:21,067
First love? What first love?

424
00:24:21,067 --> 00:24:23,033
Did you have a woman you liked too?

425
00:24:23,033 --> 00:24:25,267
Lee Kun has a first love?

426
00:24:25,267 --> 00:24:27,033
I was mistaken.

427
00:24:27,033 --> 00:24:30,200
Now that I look, the way she eats isn't lovely at all.

428
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:32,533
He got rejected.

429
00:24:32,533 --> 00:24:34,067
Is she pretty?

430
00:24:34,067 --> 00:24:36,133
Yes.

431
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,767
First love is just a thing of the past.

432
00:24:38,767 --> 00:24:41,500
I'd rather you not mention my first love anymore.

433
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:44,167
Fine, let's say you got rejected.

434
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,467
- He definitely got rejected. 
 - Did he really get rejected?

435
00:24:47,467 --> 00:24:50,633
Ah, right, where's my suitcase?

436
00:24:50,633 --> 00:24:52,900
- I threw it out. 
 - I sent it for service.

437
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:55,467
Ah, I sent it to be fixed and then threw it out.

438
00:24:55,467 --> 00:24:56,500
You threw it away?

439
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:59,867
Oh, they said it couldn't be fixed.

440
00:24:59,867 --> 00:25:02,633
But that was something I cherished.

441
00:25:02,633 --> 00:25:05,933
Just buy a new one. It doesn't cost that much.

442
00:25:08,767 --> 00:25:10,133
I got it.

443
00:25:10,133 --> 00:25:11,667
Enjoy your meal.

444
00:25:11,667 --> 00:25:15,867
Kun, you've got to finish your meal before you go.

445
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,400
Why is he…

446
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,533
Is your first love pretty?

447
00:25:19,533 --> 00:25:21,800
How did you get rejected?

448
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:24,567
Lee Kun really got rejected.

449
00:25:24,567 --> 00:25:29,200
We're now just acquaintances who met through work, so it's not a first love thing.

450
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,433
You brought your first love into the workplace?

451
00:25:31,433 --> 00:25:34,300
It's so heartbreaking.

452
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:36,900
Would you like me to tell you a secret to change her mind?

453
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:38,633
I can help you.

454
00:25:38,633 --> 00:25:40,967
Oh, right.

455
00:25:40,967 --> 00:25:44,000
That day, the day I had the accident,

456
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,833
did I just stay at home that day?

457
00:25:45,833 --> 00:25:48,167
You said I fell down the stairs.

458
00:25:48,167 --> 00:25:53,167
Well, you slept all day at home and fell down the stairs because you weren't fully awake.

459
00:25:53,167 --> 00:25:58,333
The accident happened when the family was all together, so you were discovered quickly.

460
00:25:58,333 --> 00:26:00,933
But why are you asking that?

461
00:26:00,933 --> 00:26:05,167
It's not like you're remembering old memories or anything. Right?

462
00:26:05,167 --> 00:26:07,567
Not yet.

463
00:26:07,567 --> 00:26:10,033
Okay.

464
00:26:10,867 --> 00:26:15,967
Get regular medical check-ups. Professor Han is worried about you.

465
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:30,567
   

466
00:26:30,567 --> 00:26:34,367
   

467
00:26:35,733 --> 00:26:38,600
   

468
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:41,333
   

469
00:26:41,333 --> 00:26:44,900
That night, I went to the alumni reunion,

470
00:26:47,567 --> 00:26:51,267
but why is he lying?

471
00:27:20,767 --> 00:27:24,367
 Why is the black box memory card missing? 

472
00:27:42,633 --> 00:27:47,100
 I was wrong. It was all my fault. 

473
00:28:17,867 --> 00:28:20,867
It's for everyone's good, after all.

474
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:29,733
Unit 2001!

475
00:28:29,733 --> 00:28:31,967
Yes.

476
00:28:31,967 --> 00:28:33,500
She didn't come yet?

477
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:35,700
Yes.

478
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:37,367
Understood, carry on with your work.

479
00:28:37,367 --> 00:28:39,600
Yes, all is normal during duty!

480
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,933
Safety!

481
00:28:55,800 --> 00:29:00,030
 The phone is powered off, connecting to voicemail… 

482
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:05,300
She still hasn't charged it yet.

483
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:09,767
   

484
00:29:13,233 --> 00:29:17,100
Oh, I should call you "Ms. Man" instead of "Ms. Sae Yan".

485
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:19,200
Did you drink all of this by yourself?

486
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:21,933
Sis, just lend me ten thousand won

487
00:29:21,933 --> 00:29:24,367
to buy four cans of these beers.

488
00:29:24,367 --> 00:29:27,033
This works much better than a sleeping pill at night.

489
00:29:27,033 --> 00:29:30,367
That's alcohol dependency.

490
00:29:32,667 --> 00:29:37,367
It's nice to have something to depend on when there's no one to rely on. Right?

491
00:29:37,367 --> 00:29:40,267
When I feel suffocated, if I gulp this down,

492
00:29:40,267 --> 00:29:44,267
I get this feeling as if my insides are getting cleared out.

493
00:29:44,267 --> 00:29:46,900
Does alcohol really clear that out?

494
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:49,533
Sis.

495
00:29:49,533 --> 00:29:52,033
Ta-da, don't you remember this?

496
00:29:52,033 --> 00:29:54,900
You made this for me.

497
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:56,000
Did I?

498
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,167
Yes.

499
00:29:57,167 --> 00:29:59,067
This is a wish bracelet.

500
00:29:59,067 --> 00:30:01,833
You said if I wear this and when it breaks, my wishes come true.

501
00:30:01,833 --> 00:30:04,167
You said to wear it when I have a wish I want to make.

502
00:30:04,167 --> 00:30:07,867
Do you still believe that? You're not a kid anymore.

503
00:30:07,867 --> 00:30:09,900
I saved it without using it for just any wish, and then,

504
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:11,733
I took it out after making a big decision.

505
00:30:11,733 --> 00:30:14,300
It's not about making a wish, but about making an effort.

506
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:18,033
If you don't make an effort but only make wishes, who will…

507
00:30:18,033 --> 00:30:22,967
Well, there are things that don't come true even with effort.

508
00:30:22,967 --> 00:30:25,400
Oh, my.

509
00:30:27,033 --> 00:30:30,467
Will drinking this really make me feel refreshed?

510
00:30:30,467 --> 00:30:32,567
Yes.

511
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:45,333
A dog? Why is there a dog here?

512
00:30:45,333 --> 00:30:48,767
Bark at me, doggie! Woof!

513
00:30:48,767 --> 00:30:51,367
So cute, it's so fluffy.

514
00:30:51,367 --> 00:30:52,667
Let's go for the third round.

515
00:30:52,667 --> 00:30:55,733
We are already at the fourth round. Where would we even go?

516
00:30:55,733 --> 00:30:58,533
Ah, this is why you don't usually drink much.

517
00:30:58,533 --> 00:31:02,867
I had just one wish in my life.

518
00:31:02,867 --> 00:31:05,500
So I studied to death to achieve it

519
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:09,633
and I devoted six years to do the research.

520
00:31:09,633 --> 00:31:12,200
Far from having my wish come true,

521
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:15,133
I feel so empty inside, just like this.

522
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,100
What? Is the glass leaking?

523
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:20,000
Still, you are doing well for yourself, given all the studying you did.

524
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,033
Wasn't that your wish?

525
00:31:21,033 --> 00:31:24,167
It's all about the process for the wish, the process.

526
00:31:24,167 --> 00:31:27,267
Do you know how lonely

527
00:31:27,267 --> 00:31:28,700
that process is?

528
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:32,167
How precisely a wish must be crafted.

529
00:31:32,167 --> 00:31:35,033
Because I pursued perfection,

530
00:31:35,033 --> 00:31:38,400
even my coworkers don't want to have lunch with me.

531
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:40,467
The man I trusted…

532
00:31:40,467 --> 00:31:43,500
I was taken advantage of by a senior I trusted.

533
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:45,333
And then,

534
00:31:45,333 --> 00:31:51,267
I was abandoned by the only patient I was wholeheartedly committed to.

535
00:31:51,267 --> 00:31:53,167
I'm envious of you.

536
00:31:53,167 --> 00:31:55,767
It would be nice if we were born swapped. Right?

537
00:31:55,767 --> 00:31:59,433
I envy you, Jeon Sae Yan.

538
00:31:59,433 --> 00:32:02,333
Everyone likes you.

539
00:32:02,333 --> 00:32:04,767
You grew up without the twists and turns of life,

540
00:32:04,767 --> 00:32:09,800
with plenty of love amd without any worries,

541
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:12,200
without concerns…

542
00:32:13,967 --> 00:32:16,467
I envy you.

543
00:32:19,533 --> 00:32:22,800
Looks like you really don't remember anything.

544
00:32:23,933 --> 00:32:26,600
What you see isn't everything.

545
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:30,933
I can't see anything.

546
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,333
 I'm not going. I won't go! 

547
00:32:39,333 --> 00:32:41,800
 The boss told me to bring you back. 

548
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:45,567
 Tell them I'll return after work. 

549
00:32:45,567 --> 00:32:47,267
 I don't have options. 

550
00:32:47,267 --> 00:32:49,500
 I said I'm not going! 

551
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:51,967
- You rascal! 
 - Oh, you startled me.

552
00:32:51,967 --> 00:32:55,100
Come over here.

553
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:59,333
If you came here for a trip, you should have fun and then go.

554
00:32:59,333 --> 00:33:02,033
Get lost! Go! You little brat, go.

555
00:33:02,033 --> 00:33:03,367
- Interpret it. 
 - Uh, well…

556
00:33:03,367 --> 00:33:04,267
Interpret it now!

557
00:33:04,267 --> 00:33:07,067
I'll call my dad myself.

558
00:33:07,067 --> 00:33:12,333
If you don't keep your promise, next time I'll take you no matter what.

559
00:33:12,333 --> 00:33:16,933
He said he was sorry and asked you to forgive him just once. He said he would go right now.

560
00:33:16,933 --> 00:33:20,467
- He got scared. 
 - Yes.

561
00:33:20,467 --> 00:33:22,400
Go!

562
00:33:26,833 --> 00:33:31,567
The self-defense you taught me in Italy, I did it well, right?

563
00:33:31,567 --> 00:33:36,533
If you touch her, I won't stay still!

564
00:33:36,533 --> 00:33:39,100
I'll keep an eye on it.

565
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:44,167
Are you okay?

566
00:33:44,167 --> 00:33:46,133
Of course.

567
00:33:46,833 --> 00:33:48,400
- We have to go. 
 - Where are we going?

568
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:50,367
- We should go to the fourth round. 
 - No.

569
00:33:50,367 --> 00:33:54,900
What are you talking about, Sis? This is the fourth round now.

570
00:34:09,933 --> 00:34:11,233
That's wrong.

571
00:34:11,233 --> 00:34:14,967
That man knows me.

572
00:34:14,967 --> 00:34:18,000
Can't go in, can't go in.

573
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:22,100
I can't help but wait here.

574
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:24,320
Sis!

575
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:26,160
 ­  

576
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:36,833
I want to go back again.

577
00:34:42,220 --> 00:34:44,750
Sorry!

578
00:34:47,450 --> 00:34:49,130
One second!

579
00:34:50,033 --> 00:34:52,000
   

580
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,367
There's no van.

581
00:34:53,367 --> 00:34:55,933
He hasn't come back yet.

582
00:34:55,933 --> 00:35:00,033
I'll have to wait here until he arrives.

583
00:35:00,033 --> 00:35:02,233
Sis, it's too late now.

584
00:35:02,233 --> 00:35:05,200
Let's come here again early tomorrow morning. Okay?

585
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:07,900
Sis, you're drunk now.

586
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,633
Drunk?

587
00:35:10,633 --> 00:35:12,233
Me?

588
00:35:12,233 --> 00:35:15,733
Me? I'm not drunk. I'm totally sober now.

589
00:35:15,733 --> 00:35:18,533
Go ahead.

590
00:35:19,433 --> 00:35:22,900
Really? But how can I leave you like this?

591
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:25,500
If you don't go, I won't go, either.

592
00:35:26,233 --> 00:35:28,067
Huh?

593
00:35:28,067 --> 00:35:31,900
Mom had spread out the blankets like this.

594
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:32,833
Ah, good.

595
00:35:32,833 --> 00:35:36,467
What are you doing? Get up now, please.

596
00:35:36,467 --> 00:35:39,333
It's okay. I'll sleep without washing up, just like this.

597
00:35:39,333 --> 00:35:42,467
What are you talking about? Get up now!

598
00:35:43,267 --> 00:35:46,067
Jeon Sae Yan.

599
00:35:46,067 --> 00:35:48,133
Lie down next to me.

600
00:35:48,133 --> 00:35:50,467
What are you…

601
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:56,267
It's been a while since we layed down together.

602
00:36:01,067 --> 00:36:04,700
Okay, I will protect you.

603
00:36:07,767 --> 00:36:11,733
The pillow is hard.

604
00:36:11,733 --> 00:36:13,700
Of course.

605
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:17,067
Our necks won't be able to turn tomorrow.

606
00:36:20,367 --> 00:36:25,433
If I try hard, will my wish come true?

607
00:36:26,533 --> 00:36:30,367
Of course, it's your wish.

608
00:36:30,367 --> 00:36:35,860
Right, it's the stubborn Kyeong Ju Yeon's wishes.

609
00:36:36,533 --> 00:36:40,600
I'm my dad's daughter.

610
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:49,700
Dad.

611
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:04,167
 It's been nearly half a century since I've devoted myself only to research. 

612
00:37:04,167 --> 00:37:07,067
 I treat the loneliness of the patients. 

613
00:37:07,067 --> 00:37:10,600
 But who treats my loneliness? 

614
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:12,767
Professor Han.

615
00:37:13,667 --> 00:37:16,367
Professor Han.

616
00:37:16,367 --> 00:37:17,400
Oh, why?

617
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:20,333
I called you several times, but you didn't answer.

618
00:37:20,333 --> 00:37:23,667
Gosh, this is heavy.

619
00:37:23,667 --> 00:37:25,100
This is kimchi.

620
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:28,933
We made this kimchi at home and also made some for you, Professor.

621
00:37:28,933 --> 00:37:32,967
Dr. Song, why are you giving this to me? Your family should eat this.

622
00:37:32,967 --> 00:37:36,533
Colleagues are like family, too.

623
00:37:36,533 --> 00:37:39,433
You can't eat without kimchi, right?

624
00:37:39,433 --> 00:37:41,367
I'm not sure if it'll suit your taste though.

625
00:37:41,367 --> 00:37:43,800
Make sure to have it with your meals.

626
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:47,700
What else do we have at our age? Health is the best.

627
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:50,367
I'll get going then. See you tomorrow.

628
00:37:56,167 --> 00:37:57,667
I'm like her family?

629
00:37:57,667 --> 00:37:59,633
Does she want to be family with me?

630
00:37:59,633 --> 00:38:02,267
She even knows my taste.

631
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:05,433
Does she…

632
00:38:05,433 --> 00:38:08,300
Does she like me?

633
00:38:23,967 --> 00:38:25,967
Yes, sir.

634
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:28,267
Oh, is that so?

635
00:38:28,267 --> 00:38:32,533
Yes, I'll come down right away.

636
00:38:32,533 --> 00:38:37,067
   

637
00:38:43,870 --> 00:38:45,850
   

638
00:38:48,167 --> 00:38:51,933
Sis? Sis!

639
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,300
   

640
00:38:59,020 --> 00:39:03,180
   

641
00:39:20,933 --> 00:39:23,933
Oh my.

642
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:28,600
Hey, hey.

643
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:31,767
Oh, my head hurts.

644
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:37,500
Ah, a cramp! I have a cramp! What should I do?

645
00:39:41,467 --> 00:39:42,933
Oh my, oh my.

646
00:39:42,933 --> 00:39:47,267
What are you doing in someone else's room? You must be crazy.

647
00:39:47,267 --> 00:39:50,233
What are you doing here right now?

648
00:39:52,433 --> 00:39:56,933
I thought I slept at home.

649
00:39:56,933 --> 00:39:59,333
Oh, smell of alcohol.

650
00:40:00,533 --> 00:40:03,267
Your drinking habits are also the worst.

651
00:40:03,267 --> 00:40:08,633
If it's a way to get rid of affection, it's very successful.

652
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:11,933
That's fortunate.

653
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,667
Our investor is coming,

654
00:40:16,667 --> 00:40:19,500
so please move aside.

655
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:21,733
Only if you give me the card key.

656
00:40:22,467 --> 00:40:23,800
Haven't you already lost the bet?

657
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:25,200
It's not over yet.

658
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:27,500
We won't know until the national team test.

659
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:28,900
Now, quickly.

660
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:32,200
Enough, leave now.

661
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,267
Jeez.

662
00:40:35,267 --> 00:40:37,800
Just a moment, wait.

663
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:41,133
I should meet the investor first, too.

664
00:40:41,133 --> 00:40:42,333
Oh, the alcohol smell.

665
00:40:42,333 --> 00:40:43,400
How do I look now?

666
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:48,000
As a team doctor personally selected by the CEO, I should give a greeting.

667
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,633
Ah, this is driving me crazy.

668
00:40:50,633 --> 00:40:52,267
Ah, yes, yes.

669
00:40:52,267 --> 00:40:54,500
Here's the key. Leave now.

670
00:40:57,467 --> 00:40:59,430
Go for it!

671
00:40:59,430 --> 00:41:00,700
   

672
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:03,333
Have you arrived?

673
00:41:03,333 --> 00:41:05,500
Thank you for coming in person.

674
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:07,500
Please come in.

675
00:41:23,100 --> 00:41:25,167
You should drink some herbal remedy to sober up.

676
00:41:25,167 --> 00:41:28,233
I almost got lost while going to buy this.

677
00:41:28,233 --> 00:41:30,567
I don't need things like this.

678
00:41:30,567 --> 00:41:31,900
But I'm loyal to you, right?

679
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:36,033
I slept with you so you wouldn't feel embarrassed sleeping there alone.

680
00:41:36,033 --> 00:41:38,233
Yes, I'm extremely grateful.

681
00:41:38,233 --> 00:41:40,100
And you even covered me with the blanket.

682
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:42,900
Well, it was not quite hotel-grade,

683
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:46,100
but it was like the hotel parking lot.

684
00:41:59,233 --> 00:42:01,533
Why aren't you coming in?

685
00:42:03,067 --> 00:42:05,233
You go ahead.

686
00:42:09,333 --> 00:42:12,633
What is this smell?

687
00:42:12,633 --> 00:42:16,133
Did you drink and stay out last night?

688
00:42:16,133 --> 00:42:18,167
You must have braced yourself to get in big trouble.

689
00:42:18,167 --> 00:42:19,933
- You've lost your mind. 
 - Mom.

690
00:42:19,933 --> 00:42:21,700
I had a really hard time.

691
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:22,833
- Get out. 
 - No.

692
00:42:22,833 --> 00:42:25,433
You little rascal, come here now.

693
00:42:34,967 --> 00:42:37,333
If you want to get an investment,

694
00:42:37,333 --> 00:42:41,167
you'll need the contract of a star player.

695
00:42:41,167 --> 00:42:42,967
The player Cha Si On has some issues,

696
00:42:42,967 --> 00:42:46,567
so we plan to finalize the contract by the end of this week.

697
00:42:46,567 --> 00:42:49,300
I heard that you're player Lee Shin's brother.

698
00:42:50,633 --> 00:42:52,567
Ah, yes.

699
00:42:52,567 --> 00:42:56,533
He's at the Big Picture Agency, which you have invested in.

700
00:42:56,533 --> 00:42:57,967
I heard he's about to renew his contract.

701
00:42:57,967 --> 00:43:02,967
It's hard to gauge whether he'll go to CEO Hong or to his brother.

702
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:10,833
If you're going to take a picture, take a good one.

703
00:43:10,833 --> 00:43:13,833
What's with this face?

704
00:43:13,833 --> 00:43:16,733
At least do some editing.

705
00:43:16,733 --> 00:43:19,200
They took a picture without the sender's info and sent it.

706
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:20,800
Would he or she have sent it to the reporters without a message?

707
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:23,600
If it was sent, the reporters would have contacted us first.

708
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:25,200
There's no need to worry.

709
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:27,967
You've become more lenient with scandals, but will the sponsors be too?

710
00:43:27,967 --> 00:43:30,167
There's nothing to worry about because I'm honest.

711
00:43:30,167 --> 00:43:33,167
Oh, I met her by chance…

712
00:43:35,967 --> 00:43:39,767
And if she was going to send it to reporters, she wouldn't send it to me.

713
00:43:39,767 --> 00:43:43,167
Who? Who sent it?

714
00:43:45,233 --> 00:43:47,367
She did.

715
00:43:47,367 --> 00:43:50,867
Her family is pretty influential.

716
00:43:50,867 --> 00:43:54,833
Her family is a gangster, so they warned me.

717
00:43:54,833 --> 00:43:56,133
A warning?

718
00:43:56,133 --> 00:43:59,000
I just need to make sure not to run into her again.

719
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,933
Shred it without missing a single page.

720
00:44:02,567 --> 00:44:04,700
I came here all nervous for nothing when I'm busy.

721
00:44:04,700 --> 00:44:06,167
I'm going to pratice.

722
00:44:06,167 --> 00:44:08,933
When are you going to sign the renewal contract?

723
00:44:08,933 --> 00:44:11,567
You have to speak up if you need something.

724
00:44:15,033 --> 00:44:17,533
Traitor.

725
00:44:17,533 --> 00:44:18,567
Where are you going?

726
00:44:18,567 --> 00:44:20,967
To work. I can't give up.

727
00:44:20,967 --> 00:44:24,367
My wish is also desperately needed by someone.

728
00:44:31,300 --> 00:44:33,233
Your hand.

729
00:44:38,733 --> 00:44:40,767
Why are you giving this to me?

730
00:44:40,767 --> 00:44:43,467
Let's make a wish with reverent hearts.

731
00:44:43,467 --> 00:44:45,733
Ah, it's fine. I'm not a child. Take it off now.

732
00:44:45,733 --> 00:44:47,400
Oh, you shouldn't say that.

733
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:49,033
What's this in Korean?

734
00:44:49,033 --> 00:44:51,667
Take that back now.

735
00:44:51,667 --> 00:44:53,767
Take that back.

736
00:44:54,733 --> 00:44:59,133
Please make her work go well.

737
00:45:01,900 --> 00:45:03,367
What about your wishes?

738
00:45:03,367 --> 00:45:06,500
You are more important to me than myself.

739
00:45:07,900 --> 00:45:09,300
What was your wish?

740
00:45:09,300 --> 00:45:11,167
I…

741
00:45:12,667 --> 00:45:14,667
I'll put aside my wish for a moment.

742
00:45:14,667 --> 00:45:19,067
If you need anything, whether it's love or work, tell me everything.

743
00:45:19,067 --> 00:45:23,067
I'll help you with everything.

744
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:29,600
 Even pufferfish have natural predators. 

745
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:33,833
 Only humans eat pufferfish knowing the lethal dose of its poison. 

746
00:45:33,833 --> 00:45:35,867
 Uniquely. 

747
00:45:42,667 --> 00:45:47,867
 That's how venomous people are, more than pufferfish venom. 

748
00:45:47,867 --> 00:45:52,867
 If there are no flaws, you have to find them. 

749
00:45:52,867 --> 00:45:54,967
 Isn't that so? 

750
00:46:07,100 --> 00:46:10,700
It seems like this patient, Lee Kun, likes me too.

751
00:46:10,700 --> 00:46:12,100
After seeing us dating,

752
00:46:12,100 --> 00:46:14,233
he told you not to mess with his things.

753
00:46:14,233 --> 00:46:18,167
He even punched you and discharged himself from the hospital.

754
00:46:18,167 --> 00:46:19,967
That's about Kyeong Ju Yeon.

755
00:46:19,967 --> 00:46:21,900
He said Kyeong Ju Yeon was his first love.

756
00:46:21,900 --> 00:46:25,033
He may want to challenge you.

757
00:46:25,033 --> 00:46:29,800
You should be nervous. Why do we always come to this snack bar?

758
00:46:30,533 --> 00:46:35,600
I didn't realize it before, but patient Lee Kun is handsome.

759
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:38,500
Is it really confidence that makes someone attractive?

760
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:40,967
Before? You've seen that patient before?

761
00:46:40,967 --> 00:46:42,633
Yeah.

762
00:46:42,633 --> 00:46:45,300
That… That's the person from back then.

763
00:46:45,300 --> 00:46:48,667
The person who killed mouse number 107 with a car at the hospital.

764
00:46:48,667 --> 00:46:50,633
- What? 
 - Oh.

765
00:46:50,633 --> 00:46:51,967
You weren't here, right?

766
00:46:51,967 --> 00:46:55,000
Back then, Dr. Kyeong and that patient

767
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,133
seemed to be sworn enemies.

768
00:46:57,133 --> 00:47:00,700
And she suddenly became his first love after he had brain surgery.

769
00:47:01,267 --> 00:47:04,167
That's so nice.

770
00:47:04,167 --> 00:47:06,333
I'm jealous of her.

771
00:47:10,700 --> 00:47:12,967
   

772
00:47:28,567 --> 00:47:29,867
"Love Game."

773
00:47:29,867 --> 00:47:34,933
"A scenario in a tennis match where one player fails to score any points."

774
00:47:34,933 --> 00:47:38,000
It means zero?

775
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:41,200
Wasn't a love game a couples game?

776
00:47:43,167 --> 00:47:46,500
Ah, how embarrassing.

777
00:47:57,633 --> 00:48:00,533
- Please, ring this up as well. 
 - Yes.

778
00:48:16,567 --> 00:48:18,667
Ju Yeon.

779
00:48:19,967 --> 00:48:22,300
I didn't intend to interrupt you.

780
00:48:22,300 --> 00:48:25,533
Did you come to see me? I went to see you too.

781
00:48:25,533 --> 00:48:26,933
Ah, that…

782
00:48:26,933 --> 00:48:30,733
I'm trying to learn about tennis for the consultation.

783
00:48:31,267 --> 00:48:34,600
Are you perhaps offering to counsel me?

784
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:37,167
Player Cha Si On.

785
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:39,367
Cha Si On.

786
00:48:39,367 --> 00:48:42,367
I read that book and kept watching tennis broadcasts

787
00:48:42,367 --> 00:48:46,500
but maybe it's because I'm in a rush, but no matter how much I read, I can't understand the rules well.

788
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:49,467
I did memorize quite a few words though.

789
00:48:51,300 --> 00:48:55,067
Do you know what dating and sports have in common?

790
00:48:55,867 --> 00:48:59,800
It's not done with the head, but with the body.

791
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:02,633
You remember it by doing it yourself.

792
00:49:02,633 --> 00:49:05,400
Otherwise, you might forget by tomorrow.

793
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:09,367
I've never tried it before.

794
00:49:09,367 --> 00:49:13,067
Wait a minute, just a moment.

795
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:21,867
Now.

796
00:49:21,867 --> 00:49:24,167
How do I do it?

797
00:49:24,167 --> 00:49:28,467
♫  Some word made you change  ♫

798
00:49:28,467 --> 00:49:30,233
Like this, like this.

799
00:49:30,233 --> 00:49:33,000
- Try holding it again. 
 - Okay, again.

800
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:34,633
Now, look.

801
00:49:34,633 --> 00:49:36,000
I'll count one, two, three.

802
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:39,133
One, two, three.

803
00:49:39,133 --> 00:49:40,200
- Like this. 
 - Ah.

804
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:42,533
Okay, let's try again, just like this.

805
00:49:42,533 --> 00:49:46,067
One, two, three.

806
00:49:46,067 --> 00:49:48,100
Is this right?

807
00:49:48,100 --> 00:49:50,633
Well done.

808
00:49:50,633 --> 00:49:52,133
Well done.

809
00:49:52,133 --> 00:49:54,633
Ah, then shall we try a backhand, too?

810
00:49:54,633 --> 00:49:57,000
- Good. 
 - The backhand is the opposite way.

811
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,667
Okay, just like that.

812
00:49:59,667 --> 00:50:02,567
- One, two, hit. 
 - Hit.

813
00:50:02,567 --> 00:50:04,433
- Your arm comes up like this. 
 - Ah.

814
00:50:04,433 --> 00:50:06,233
Okay, I'll try it.

815
00:50:06,233 --> 00:50:09,233
One, two, three.

816
00:50:10,233 --> 00:50:12,133
Is this right?

817
00:50:12,133 --> 00:50:14,367
It was perfect.

818
00:50:14,367 --> 00:50:16,033
Now I get it.

819
00:50:16,033 --> 00:50:19,167
Allright, then let's try one forehand, one backhand, in succession.

820
00:50:19,167 --> 00:50:20,633
- In succession? 
 - Yes.

821
00:50:20,633 --> 00:50:23,167
- But… 
 - One, two, three.

822
00:50:24,467 --> 00:50:26,000
How was it? Was it correct?

823
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:27,200
It was perfect.

824
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:30,167
Ah, now I understand.

825
00:50:30,167 --> 00:50:31,733
This is fun.

826
00:50:31,733 --> 00:50:36,970
♫  We only know unsophisticated words  ♫

827
00:50:36,970 --> 00:50:41,870
♫  But I know everything, you like me a lot  ♫

828
00:50:41,870 --> 00:50:47,410
♫  It's just because it's the start of our romance  ♫

829
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:49,700
Why are you here at this hour?

830
00:50:49,700 --> 00:50:52,567
Surprise!

831
00:50:52,567 --> 00:50:55,033
My friend.

832
00:50:55,033 --> 00:50:59,000
The time is… Hey, slippers, slippers!

833
00:50:59,767 --> 00:51:01,867
Wow.

834
00:51:01,867 --> 00:51:04,567
Hey, look at this place.

835
00:51:04,567 --> 00:51:07,500
What? Why is this place so good?

836
00:51:07,500 --> 00:51:10,333
"Agency Goon."

837
00:51:10,333 --> 00:51:13,100
It's tremendous.

838
00:51:13,100 --> 00:51:16,800
This is totally a hotel, a hotel. Whose room is this?

839
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:19,733
Hey, this isn't a house, it's a company.

840
00:51:19,733 --> 00:51:20,667
A bedroom.

841
00:51:20,667 --> 00:51:22,667
But why are you here without contacting me first?

842
00:51:22,667 --> 00:51:25,500
Hey, we're closer than that. Right?

843
00:51:25,500 --> 00:51:26,900
Here it is.

844
00:51:26,900 --> 00:51:29,633
I'm going to look around a bit.

845
00:51:29,633 --> 00:51:31,400
So this is my room.

846
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:34,433
- Why are you lying there? 
 - It's good, I like it.

847
00:51:36,067 --> 00:51:37,633
Ta-da.

848
00:51:37,633 --> 00:51:40,000
Ah, come out, come out.

849
00:51:40,010 --> 00:51:42,720
Woah!

850
00:51:43,690 --> 00:51:46,060
Wow, look at this.

851
00:51:46,067 --> 00:51:49,067
Somehow I thought it was strange.

852
00:51:49,067 --> 00:51:50,067
What?

853
00:51:50,067 --> 00:51:54,667
You worked all night at the sports agency?

854
00:51:54,667 --> 00:51:56,533
What is this? What is this?

855
00:51:56,533 --> 00:51:57,933
Huh? What's this?

856
00:51:57,933 --> 00:52:02,533
Give it back to me. This belongs to our team doctor. No, it's the candidate team doctor's.

857
00:52:02,533 --> 00:52:04,900
A team doctor?

858
00:52:04,900 --> 00:52:08,800
There's a team doctor in the agency?

859
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:13,700
But it seems the team doctor is a woman. Right?

860
00:52:13,700 --> 00:52:15,900
Well, I'm going to pick a new team doctor.

861
00:52:15,900 --> 00:52:18,133
A man I have no interest in at all.

862
00:52:18,133 --> 00:52:20,233
Interest? Interest?

863
00:52:20,233 --> 00:52:23,267
That means you have some interest in her.

864
00:52:23,267 --> 00:52:24,867
No, that's not it.

865
00:52:24,867 --> 00:52:29,233
It's that person you met at the hospital before… that…

866
00:52:29,233 --> 00:52:31,267
First…

867
00:52:31,267 --> 00:52:33,150
First love.

868
00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:37,067
It's her, but it's not working out.

869
00:52:37,067 --> 00:52:38,900
Even if I've sorted out my emotions now,

870
00:52:38,900 --> 00:52:41,467
it could suddenly pop out like a virus carrier.

871
00:52:41,467 --> 00:52:44,167
So I'm trying to block it from the start.

872
00:52:44,167 --> 00:52:46,233
Hey, that's a good thought.

873
00:52:46,233 --> 00:52:48,533
Send her out right now.

874
00:52:48,533 --> 00:52:51,267
But why are you telling me to send her out?

875
00:52:51,267 --> 00:52:52,633
What?

876
00:52:52,633 --> 00:52:55,600
Well, I mean… There's no chance it'll go well.

877
00:52:55,600 --> 00:52:59,133
Why would you insist on keeping your first love by your side?

878
00:52:59,133 --> 00:53:01,333
Hey, well. I'll have to keep an eye on you.

879
00:53:01,333 --> 00:53:04,167
I'm going to take a shower, so please get me a towel.

880
00:53:04,167 --> 00:53:07,000
Hey, hey, why are you going there?

881
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,033
I'm going to sleep over.

882
00:53:09,033 --> 00:53:11,333
What are you planning to do after sending me away?

883
00:53:12,633 --> 00:53:14,167
Hey, hey, hey.

884
00:53:14,167 --> 00:53:15,867
I said I'm going to sleep over.

885
00:53:15,867 --> 00:53:17,767
You are banned from visiting after 7:00 p.m.

886
00:53:17,767 --> 00:53:18,867
Oh, and,

887
00:53:18,867 --> 00:53:22,567
I heard you're a candidate for the national coach, you're getting closer to success.

888
00:53:22,567 --> 00:53:25,400
Congratulations, do it well.

889
00:53:26,667 --> 00:53:31,133
That…

890
00:53:31,133 --> 00:53:34,533
Wait, first love?

891
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:39,900
In the past, she had something with Shin.

892
00:53:39,900 --> 00:53:42,500
I can't even tell him about this.

893
00:53:42,500 --> 00:53:43,867
Shall I go?

894
00:53:43,867 --> 00:53:47,400
    
 Ah, yes, let's set off.

895
00:53:50,300 --> 00:53:53,033
- Isn't that the player Lee Shin? 
 - Player Lee Shin.

896
00:53:58,233 --> 00:54:00,167
Where is this place?

897
00:54:00,167 --> 00:54:02,300
Did you move?

898
00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:06,433
No, there's a place I need to drop by.

899
00:54:06,433 --> 00:54:08,767
I'll go on my own from here.

900
00:54:08,767 --> 00:54:11,133
The expert even gave a one-on-one lesson.

901
00:54:11,133 --> 00:54:12,767
I'll treat you to a meal next time.

902
00:54:12,767 --> 00:54:16,567
Tomorrow, I have to go to the hospital to consult with player Cha Si On.

903
00:54:16,567 --> 00:54:17,733
Medical test.

904
00:54:17,733 --> 00:54:19,767
Just by chance!

905
00:54:19,767 --> 00:54:22,267
I'm going tomorrow, too. How about tomorrow?

906
00:54:22,267 --> 00:54:24,233
What?

907
00:54:24,233 --> 00:54:28,233
You said, "Let's have a meal together." Was that just a passing remark?

908
00:54:28,233 --> 00:54:30,367
Why is everyone like that?

909
00:54:30,367 --> 00:54:32,400
Promises must be kept.

910
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:35,633
Yes, yes, let's have lunch tomorrow.

911
00:54:41,030 --> 00:54:42,520
Oh, right.

912
00:54:46,133 --> 00:54:48,133
Here.

913
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:50,850
Ah...

914
00:54:52,700 --> 00:54:56,267
Mine's out of battery, but…

915
00:54:58,167 --> 00:55:00,300
I'll go.

916
00:55:02,133 --> 00:55:05,167
Is that bracelet in fashion?

917
00:55:05,167 --> 00:55:07,833
Next lesson, we will play a game.

918
00:55:07,833 --> 00:55:11,467
A game with an active player? It's obvious it will be a love game.

919
00:55:11,467 --> 00:55:13,033
Let's do that.

920
00:55:13,033 --> 00:55:14,767
Love game.

921
00:55:14,767 --> 00:55:16,733
Okay.

922
00:55:19,967 --> 00:55:23,333
A very intense love game.

923
00:55:50,233 --> 00:55:51,300
Yes.

924
00:55:51,300 --> 00:55:53,167
Respect solely for my lifesaver.

925
00:55:53,167 --> 00:55:54,900
No, no.

926
00:55:54,900 --> 00:55:58,867
Welfare for the prospective employee, yes.

927
00:55:59,567 --> 00:56:01,833
Oh, I'm a good person.

928
00:56:07,967 --> 00:56:10,133
Oh my, what's going on?

929
00:56:11,500 --> 00:56:13,900
What's going on?

930
00:56:13,900 --> 00:56:16,167
Oh my, oh my.

931
00:56:16,167 --> 00:56:18,167
What's so good about that kind of woman?

932
00:56:18,167 --> 00:56:21,067
Look at that, look at that.

933
00:56:21,067 --> 00:56:23,833
She keeps behaving indiscreetly like that.

934
00:56:23,833 --> 00:56:25,433
It's driving me crazy.

935
00:56:25,433 --> 00:56:27,700
I want to...

936
00:56:28,667 --> 00:56:29,767
keep helping her.

937
00:56:29,767 --> 00:56:31,133
Do you need some help?

938
00:56:31,133 --> 00:56:33,900
No, it's okay. I can do it myself.

939
00:56:33,900 --> 00:56:35,067
Oh my, oh my.

940
00:56:35,067 --> 00:56:36,067
I'll help you.

941
00:56:36,067 --> 00:56:38,133
I said it's okay.

942
00:56:38,133 --> 00:56:40,567
Ah, yes.

943
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:48,267
At least she is firm to all men, not just me.

944
00:56:49,767 --> 00:56:50,933
Geez.

945
00:56:50,933 --> 00:56:53,267
Geez, oh my.

946
00:56:55,800 --> 00:57:00,000
She has strong pride and bad drinking habits.

947
00:57:00,867 --> 00:57:03,767
Ugh, she's the worst.

948
00:57:20,430 --> 00:57:22,870
   

949
00:57:51,067 --> 00:57:53,467
Oh right, battery.

950
00:58:05,033 --> 00:58:07,100
Who are you?

951
00:58:13,633 --> 00:58:15,567
Hey!

952
00:58:25,933 --> 00:58:27,100
Oh?

953
00:58:27,100 --> 00:58:28,833
You are the lady from back then.

954
00:58:28,833 --> 00:58:31,367
Why are you here again?

955
00:58:31,367 --> 00:58:34,500
Right, here…

956
00:58:55,660 --> 00:58:58,800
I came because I couldn't properly apologize to Ju Yeon.

957
00:58:58,800 --> 00:59:02,767
Sneaking up on her like a cat burglar to apologize?

958
00:59:03,533 --> 00:59:06,100
Ah, nosebleed.

959
00:59:06,833 --> 00:59:10,667
We made a deal that we'd date once Ju Yeon returned from the U.K.

960
00:59:10,667 --> 00:59:13,300
But I ended up dating another researcher.

961
00:59:13,300 --> 00:59:15,967
Ju Yeon firmly believes she's going out with me.

962
00:59:15,967 --> 00:59:18,367
My girlfriend has no idea about this situation.

963
00:59:18,367 --> 00:59:22,367
I also had such a hard time between the two women.

964
00:59:28,100 --> 00:59:32,000
Even if it looks like I'm playing a double game, isn't it a good thing?

965
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:35,933
Explain directly to the person who was hurt by you.

966
00:59:35,933 --> 00:59:40,300
Why are you explaining all the details to me?

967
00:59:40,300 --> 00:59:42,933
Since Ju Yeon is your first love,

968
00:59:42,933 --> 00:59:45,500
so it seems like you have animosity towards me.

969
00:59:45,500 --> 00:59:47,900
And you were suddenly discharged after that day.

970
00:59:47,900 --> 00:59:49,833
Well…

971
00:59:49,833 --> 00:59:54,867
If you are uncomfortable with me being your primary doctor, I'll recommend another doctor.

972
00:59:58,533 --> 01:00:01,733
Surely, the primary doctor knows my body the best.

973
01:00:02,367 --> 01:00:04,167
I will get the test done on time.

974
01:00:04,167 --> 01:00:06,567
By the way,

975
01:00:06,567 --> 01:00:09,333
you said Ju Yeon was your first love.

976
01:00:09,333 --> 01:00:14,933
Do you remember how you met Ju Yeon when you were young?

977
01:00:14,933 --> 01:00:18,900
I was just taken aback because you suddenly said that she was your first love.

978
01:00:18,900 --> 01:00:21,400
I'm not sure why you're curious about that.

979
01:00:21,400 --> 01:00:26,433
I don't want to take up my busy time to play nostalgia with you.

980
01:00:27,700 --> 01:00:28,967
Are you sure?

981
01:00:28,967 --> 01:00:31,667
That Ju Yeon is your first love?

982
01:00:31,667 --> 01:00:33,633
Are you sure?

983
01:00:44,833 --> 01:00:47,200
Why is he ringing the bell?

984
01:00:49,500 --> 01:00:52,533
He can just come in without doing that.

985
01:00:55,367 --> 01:00:57,700
Ta-da!

986
01:01:00,300 --> 01:01:03,000
Why are you here?

987
01:01:08,500 --> 01:01:11,067
Then you are

988
01:01:11,067 --> 01:01:12,700
my brother's

989
01:01:12,700 --> 01:01:14,867
first love?

990
01:01:21,600 --> 01:01:24,500
Yes, she's my first love.

991
01:01:25,150 --> 01:01:30,290


992
01:01:31,233 --> 01:01:35,333
   

993
01:01:35,333 --> 01:01:41,410
♫  Drowning, drowning in an ocean of grey  ♫

994
01:01:43,100 --> 01:01:46,730
♫  Running  ♫

995
01:01:46,730 --> 01:01:51,660
♫  Running backwards to you  ♫

996
01:01:54,470 --> 01:02:04,730
♫  Drowning, drowning in an ocean of grey  ♫

997
01:02:04,733 --> 01:02:09,800
   

998
01:02:09,800 --> 01:02:10,767
 Nice to meet you for the first time. 

999
01:02:10,767 --> 01:02:12,233
 Is he mad because I didn't tell him about it? 

1000
01:02:12,233 --> 01:02:14,367
 Are you scared that I'm joining as the team doctor? 

1001
01:02:14,367 --> 01:02:16,400
 It's just that I feel uncomfortable. 

1002
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:18,033
 It's not like I'm working naked. 

1003
01:02:18,033 --> 01:02:21,267
 Shin, do you want to live like everyone else? Are you the only one sacrificing? 

1004
01:02:21,267 --> 01:02:23,567
 Player Lee Shin, is there really something going on? 

1005
01:02:23,567 --> 01:02:25,067
 Who exactly are you looking for? 

1006
01:02:25,067 --> 01:02:26,400
 The person I love. 

1007
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:27,833
 That person used to live here when I was young. 

1008
01:02:27,833 --> 01:02:29,133
 Have you fallen for me? 

1009
01:02:29,133 --> 01:02:31,300
 Then, I might end up really liking you again. 

1010
01:02:31,300 --> 01:02:33,233
 That's all I can do for you. 

1011
01:02:33,233 --> 01:02:35,267
 I've brought an interpreter, where should I take her? 

1012
01:02:35,267 --> 01:02:37,400
 This was the place in that memory. 

1013
01:02:37,400 --> 01:02:39,100
 You can't be by his side. 

1014
01:02:39,100 --> 01:02:42,567
 Please don't give Kun trouble anymore and just leave.
