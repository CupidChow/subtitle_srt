1
00:00:06,170 --> 00:00:07,910
 ­  

2
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:14,470
 ­  

3
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:18,040
   

4
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:22,720
   

5
00:00:25,433 --> 00:00:33,300
   

6
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:39,300
   

7
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:44,600
   

8
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:48,833
You must already know him without me saying.

9
00:00:48,833 --> 00:00:50,933
The player, Lee Shin.

10
00:00:50,933 --> 00:00:53,633
He may not look like me because he has inferior genes compared to me,

11
00:00:53,633 --> 00:00:55,367
but he's my brother.

12
00:00:55,367 --> 00:00:57,000
I know the player Lee Shin well.

13
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I'm somewhat famous. Right?

14
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,400
Nice to meet you.

15
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:05,567
Ah, yes.

16
00:01:05,567 --> 00:01:10,600
This is Dr. Kyeong Ju Yeon, the temporary team doctor at our agency.

17
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:16,933
It seems like there's more to introduce about her.

18
00:01:17,767 --> 00:01:22,533
You liked her when you were very young?

19
00:01:24,133 --> 00:01:27,867
Ah, right! She's my first love.

20
00:01:27,867 --> 00:01:31,733
The one who saved me when I fell into the water as a kid.

21
00:01:31,733 --> 00:01:33,767
She's my lifesaver.

22
00:01:35,433 --> 00:01:40,733
So that was when you fell into the river near Grandmother's house?

23
00:01:40,733 --> 00:01:42,500
Yes.

24
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:50,567
What a great connection.

25
00:01:50,567 --> 00:01:53,567
You two meet again as doctor and patient.

26
00:01:53,567 --> 00:01:55,500
Well, should I get you a drink or something?

27
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:58,167
Oh, no. No, thank you.

28
00:01:58,167 --> 00:02:02,133
There's beer here. I'll open one for you.

29
00:02:02,667 --> 00:02:04,700
Here it is.

30
00:02:11,267 --> 00:02:14,567
I was going to teach you something tonight.

31
00:02:14,567 --> 00:02:16,467
But I forgot about the medical test tomorrow.

32
00:02:16,467 --> 00:02:18,300
- I'm leaving. 
 - Take care.

33
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:19,533
I'll be going.

34
00:02:19,533 --> 00:02:22,067
- Are you leaving already? 
 - Yes.

35
00:02:22,933 --> 00:02:25,167
But aren't you getting off work?

36
00:02:27,767 --> 00:02:29,333
I was about to leave as well.

37
00:02:29,333 --> 00:02:33,333
I also need to charge my phone.

38
00:02:40,533 --> 00:02:42,633
Let's go.

39
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:48,033
Then I'll be getting off work.

40
00:02:48,033 --> 00:02:52,533
Yes, go home safely.

41
00:02:53,690 --> 00:03:03,160


42
00:03:03,967 --> 00:03:09,167
   

43
00:03:10,933 --> 00:03:14,567
I would have come with you, if I had known you'd be here.

44
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:19,200
I didn't say anything because it's not yet decided that I'll be the team doctor.

45
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,067
You might have noticed the circumstances under which I became the team doctor.

46
00:03:22,067 --> 00:03:25,833
Because of the clinical trial, I have to observe your brother without him knowing.

47
00:03:25,833 --> 00:03:29,600
I'm also worried about potential side effects.

48
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:32,600
Is it kind of like an undercover investigation?

49
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:37,933
I want to take responsibility for the subject until the end, and I should do that.

50
00:03:37,933 --> 00:03:40,367
You do that for all subjects. Right?

51
00:03:40,367 --> 00:03:42,800
Because of your sense of responsibility towards your patients,

52
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:45,867
you even take a leave of absence from the hospital and work undercover alongside the subjects.

53
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,433
You are my brother's first love, so do you feel a stronger responsibility?

54
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:55,467
It would have been the same even if I wasn't his first love.

55
00:03:55,467 --> 00:03:59,067
It seems even bad memories get covered up if there are good ones.

56
00:03:59,067 --> 00:04:02,700
All my brother's bad memories seem to have been erased,

57
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:06,033
but the memory of falling into water hasn't.

58
00:04:07,367 --> 00:04:09,733
Is it the power of love?

59
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:14,967
Let's go. I'll take you home.

60
00:04:14,967 --> 00:04:17,300
No, it's okay.

61
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:20,400
See you at the hospital tomorrow at lunch.

62
00:04:22,233 --> 00:04:24,033
Yes.

63
00:04:28,633 --> 00:04:31,200
Is he mad because I didn't say anything?

64
00:04:32,633 --> 00:04:36,900
I came out because I was worried that he would feel awkward.

65
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:39,600
But there's a lot of work to do.

66
00:04:52,067 --> 00:04:53,767
 Are you sure? 

67
00:04:55,033 --> 00:04:59,633
 Are you sure Ju Yeon is your first love? 

68
00:04:59,633 --> 00:05:02,467
 You must have run into each other coming and going from the hospital. 

69
00:05:02,467 --> 00:05:04,000
 You didn't know her until then, 

70
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,467
 but when you woke up from surgery, you said that she was your first love. 

71
00:05:08,467 --> 00:05:10,233
 Doesn't that seem strange? 

72
00:05:10,233 --> 00:05:16,400
 My memory is clear, so please ask the person directly about the rest. 

73
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:19,100
 And apologize to her directly. 

74
00:05:23,633 --> 00:05:26,933
 My memory is clear, 

75
00:05:26,933 --> 00:05:28,867
 but why is everyone… 

76
00:05:38,133 --> 00:05:40,667
It's refreshing. Right?

77
00:05:43,133 --> 00:05:48,333
I came back because I felt refreshed thinking about winning the bet.

78
00:05:51,333 --> 00:05:52,967
Yeah?

79
00:05:52,967 --> 00:05:55,333
But...

80
00:05:55,333 --> 00:05:58,933
does cramming really change the outcome all at once?

81
00:05:58,933 --> 00:06:03,633
Cramming is better than not doing anything.

82
00:06:04,233 --> 00:06:08,533
Are you scared that I'm joining as the team doctor?

83
00:06:09,333 --> 00:06:11,133
No.

84
00:06:11,133 --> 00:06:14,000
I'm just uncomfortable.

85
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,700
The fact that a man and a woman are alone in the same space.

86
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:20,100
We're not just a couple, but we're colleagues.

87
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:22,667
If you don't have emotions, what could be uncomfortable?

88
00:06:22,667 --> 00:06:25,567
It's not like we're working naked.

89
00:06:26,333 --> 00:06:30,767
Why did you suddenly start to do the cleaning? Do you need help?

90
00:06:30,767 --> 00:06:33,267
No, no. Don't come over. I don't want that.

91
00:06:33,267 --> 00:06:35,333
You'll do your work, and I'll work on mine.

92
00:06:35,333 --> 00:06:38,133
I just need to clean the floor because it's dirty.

93
00:06:38,133 --> 00:06:40,867
You just do your work.

94
00:06:40,867 --> 00:06:43,267
His personality is really…

95
00:06:43,267 --> 00:06:46,867
Even if a person is hanging there like a bat,

96
00:06:46,867 --> 00:06:50,967
if it's not your business, you'd just walk away.

97
00:06:50,967 --> 00:06:53,600
Ah, I'm really getting angry.

98
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:57,433
Consider your own temperament more than mine.

99
00:06:57,433 --> 00:07:02,033
I've heard of 'car camping', but 'drunk camping' is new to me.

100
00:07:02,033 --> 00:07:04,700
Do you know who made me drink so much?

101
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:07,533
You've seen all of my humiliations.

102
00:07:07,533 --> 00:07:12,700
Why did you stop talking? Please continue.

103
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:15,467
It's just my embarrassments have been exposed.

104
00:07:15,467 --> 00:07:18,533
You saw me embarrass myself when I was doing an event for a guy.

105
00:07:18,533 --> 00:07:20,367
Oh, I see.

106
00:07:20,367 --> 00:07:24,267
Do you have nothing? Something to tease you about?

107
00:07:24,267 --> 00:07:29,500
I am always perfect, so why would I have such a thing?

108
00:07:31,467 --> 00:07:34,133
Oh my, oh my.

109
00:07:37,733 --> 00:07:38,867
Oh.

110
00:07:38,867 --> 00:07:41,267
It's the charger I've been searching for.

111
00:07:41,267 --> 00:07:43,367
And it's a new one.

112
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:48,100
 Did you buy it for me? 

113
00:07:49,233 --> 00:07:51,167
Excuse me.

114
00:07:54,533 --> 00:07:56,267
Excuse me.

115
00:07:56,267 --> 00:07:58,200
Oh my.

116
00:08:00,567 --> 00:08:03,333
This one. This one.

117
00:08:04,133 --> 00:08:08,167
Are you overestimating yourself?

118
00:08:08,167 --> 00:08:10,267
That charger isn't mine.

119
00:08:10,267 --> 00:08:11,900
Is this the landlord's?

120
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:15,400
What? Does that make sense?

121
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,800
Yes, it makes sense.

122
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,600
Why would I do something that could be misunderstood by someone I have no personal interest in?

123
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:23,333
If you have proof that

124
00:08:23,333 --> 00:08:26,733
I bought that charger, I'll hire you right now.

125
00:08:26,733 --> 00:08:28,667
You.

126
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:33,867
I'm going to watch the footage of player Cha Si On's game.

127
00:08:33,867 --> 00:08:36,967
Would you like to watch it together?

128
00:08:36,967 --> 00:08:40,400
If it helps with the consultation, I think I should do what I can.

129
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:43,267
Do you have any snacks?

130
00:08:47,033 --> 00:08:49,000
I'm back…

131
00:08:50,567 --> 00:08:52,900
What time is it now?

132
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:57,000
You told CEO Hong that you were going home a long time ago.

133
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,100
But why didn't you answer the phone?

134
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:03,033
I forgot to call because I was visiting Kun's agency.

135
00:09:03,033 --> 00:09:04,833
You…

136
00:09:04,833 --> 00:09:06,800
Did you drink?

137
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,633
Are you out of your mind?

138
00:09:08,633 --> 00:09:11,033
Don't you know you have a medical test tomorrow?

139
00:09:11,033 --> 00:09:13,667
At this age, he can drink alcohol and things like that.

140
00:09:13,667 --> 00:09:16,633
Do you think that makes sense?

141
00:09:17,667 --> 00:09:20,700
Do you want to live a normal life?

142
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:25,467
Then you should quit being an athlete. How can you be so irresponsible?

143
00:09:25,467 --> 00:09:27,500
Are you the only one who's sacrificing?

144
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:32,100
Don't you know that the whole family is making sacrifices to support you?

145
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:36,333
Because I was busy taking care of you, I couldn't even look after your brother.

146
00:09:36,333 --> 00:09:38,767
Don't you even feel sorry?

147
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:44,033
Your Majesty, the Queen Dowager, I have committed a deadly sin.

148
00:09:44,033 --> 00:09:46,367
Please kill me for committing a rash act.

149
00:09:46,367 --> 00:09:47,700
- What? 
 - Please kill me.

150
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:49,333
- Why are you doing this? 
 - Please kill me.

151
00:09:49,333 --> 00:09:51,367
Crown Prince... Crown Prince, get up.

152
00:09:51,367 --> 00:09:53,000
I think he drank a bit too much.

153
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,400
- Let's go, let's go… 
 - No.

154
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:57,200
No, Dad, I'm okay.

155
00:10:02,133 --> 00:10:04,233
Oh, my back is hurt.

156
00:10:06,767 --> 00:10:10,633
Now I finally got closer to my brother.

157
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,967
I'm trying to enjoy it.

158
00:10:14,967 --> 00:10:17,333
Yeah, go ahead and enjoy it.

159
00:10:17,333 --> 00:10:19,267
Try lifting your leg.

160
00:10:19,267 --> 00:10:21,433
Lift your leg.

161
00:10:21,433 --> 00:10:23,300
Sleep, okay?

162
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:25,533
Yes.

163
00:10:38,733 --> 00:10:42,133
I saw that online.

164
00:10:42,133 --> 00:10:44,767
Even looking at it, I couldn't understand.

165
00:10:46,567 --> 00:10:48,233
Huh? Just now! Did you see it just now?

166
00:10:48,233 --> 00:10:49,567
Isn't that a foul?

167
00:10:49,567 --> 00:10:51,167
Isn't it a foul?

168
00:10:51,167 --> 00:10:53,667
No, it seems right.

169
00:10:53,667 --> 00:10:56,167
Look here. This part seems quite important.

170
00:10:56,167 --> 00:10:58,300
Isn't it?

171
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:00,233
Oh my, what is it?

172
00:11:00,233 --> 00:11:01,933
When did you sit so close? Huh?

173
00:11:01,933 --> 00:11:05,300
Didn't you sneakily come and sit next to me?

174
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:08,600
I guess the sofa is leaning to one side.

175
00:11:11,533 --> 00:11:14,067
Foul, foul! It's a foul.

176
00:11:14,067 --> 00:11:17,100
Huh? Foul…

177
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:21,333
Foul… Isn't that foul? It really seems like a foul.

178
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:34,067
Thanks to you, I will eat well.

179
00:11:34,067 --> 00:11:35,500
- What are you doing? 
 - What do you mean?

180
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:38,567
Do you know what the scariest affection in the world is?

181
00:11:38,567 --> 00:11:39,833
'Food-ship'.

182
00:11:39,833 --> 00:11:42,267
Eating together builds a bond.

183
00:11:42,267 --> 00:11:44,200
We can't eat together.

184
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:47,833
You're going to eat all this by yourself? Being petty about food is stingy.

185
00:11:47,833 --> 00:11:52,333
What if we become attached by eating together? What if I start liking you?

186
00:11:52,333 --> 00:11:54,400
You should eat salad for breakfast.

187
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:57,200
Who eats meat in the morning?

188
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:03,200
This salad looks so fresh, so it must be really delicious.

189
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:09,733
The smell of fresh salad.

190
00:12:17,267 --> 00:12:19,400
Are you doing this on purpose to give me a hard time?

191
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:22,333
Otherwise, who grills meat in the morning?

192
00:12:22,333 --> 00:12:25,667
No, I also eat raw fish.

193
00:12:26,867 --> 00:12:28,367
Does staying up all night for a few days

194
00:12:28,367 --> 00:12:33,000
get the sport that you had no interest in into your head?

195
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,133
Don't worry about me, but…

196
00:12:36,133 --> 00:12:38,667
You should worry about yourself.

197
00:12:38,667 --> 00:12:42,200
If you can't close a contract with the player Cha Si On, will you get any investment?

198
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:45,833
Korean players will be divided into these two.

199
00:12:45,833 --> 00:12:47,200
A player belonging to my company.

200
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:51,400
And the players who will belong to my company.

201
00:12:53,933 --> 00:12:59,667
I have a lunch appointment at 12:00, so you can eat all my salad.

202
00:13:16,833 --> 00:13:19,933
Dad? It's Sae Yan.

203
00:13:19,933 --> 00:13:24,033
I forgot to tell you that I was in Korea.

204
00:13:24,033 --> 00:13:26,500
Excuse me.

205
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:28,800
I'll hang out in Korea some more and then go back.

206
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,933
Please give me the credit card…

207
00:13:34,667 --> 00:13:37,633
Yes, it's your money, but you never allowed me to earn money. Right?

208
00:13:37,633 --> 00:13:42,000
You don't even let me work part-time, so of course I don't have the money.

209
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:46,200
Yes, yes.

210
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:49,267
I'll take a good rest on my own before leaving.

211
00:13:49,267 --> 00:13:51,367
Just give me a little bit of time.

212
00:13:51,367 --> 00:13:54,533
Hello, Dad?

213
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,533
I need to find that person quickly.

214
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:28,267
Ugh, it's lukewarm.

215
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:33,233
This is sparkling water.

216
00:14:33,233 --> 00:14:35,267
That's alcohol.

217
00:14:35,267 --> 00:14:38,033
Why did you bury alcohol under the ground?

218
00:14:41,267 --> 00:14:42,967
Your grandma makes kimchi, right?

219
00:14:42,967 --> 00:14:44,600
When making kimchi, she buries it under the ground. Right?

220
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:46,967
You bury precious things under the ground.

221
00:14:46,967 --> 00:14:49,533
It's a secret from your grandma.

222
00:14:49,533 --> 00:14:52,600
You can use it. You don't have money, right?

223
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:58,100
Pretty aunt is also our family, so take it.

224
00:14:58,100 --> 00:14:59,933
Family?

225
00:15:00,767 --> 00:15:05,367
You and your grandma are way better than my real family.

226
00:15:05,367 --> 00:15:10,067
And this, once I've sorted things out.

227
00:15:11,233 --> 00:15:14,500
I'll double it and then pay you back.

228
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,600
I promise.

229
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:20,433
Hello, this is the call-taxi service. Right?

230
00:15:20,433 --> 00:15:22,667
Yes, it's a round trip to Jincheon.

231
00:15:22,667 --> 00:15:26,633
I have to pay in coins…

232
00:15:26,633 --> 00:15:29,400
I will call you back.

233
00:15:31,133 --> 00:15:33,233
Why do you keep staring at me?

234
00:15:33,233 --> 00:15:35,000
I need to cut open your stomach.

235
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:39,200
If you look at me like that, it hurts my feelings.

236
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:06,633
Grand Queen Dowager.

237
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:11,433
Trainer, trainer.

238
00:16:11,433 --> 00:16:13,433
I'll hang up now.

239
00:16:17,133 --> 00:16:20,667
Why isn't she coming out? I just wanted to see her face before leaving.

240
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:24,900
Go ahead, take a look.

241
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:29,133
Hey, why are you here? Hey, get out, get out.

242
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:32,900
Let's play together. Let me brighten your mood.

243
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:36,567
Are you asking me to play with you so that I can suffer trouble from your father again?

244
00:16:36,567 --> 00:16:40,900
I got the picture your dad sent, from the person he sent to take of you and me.

245
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:42,433
As humiliation shots?

246
00:16:42,433 --> 00:16:46,533
Keep them as a memory. You don't even have usual date photos.

247
00:16:46,533 --> 00:16:48,267
You left so quickly because you were afraid something big would happen.

248
00:16:48,267 --> 00:16:52,333
If he's going to take a photo of us, please tell your father to use a filter.

249
00:16:53,033 --> 00:16:56,067
Your mother also seemed pretty scary because you lied to her.

250
00:16:56,067 --> 00:16:59,133
This doesn't look like a training ground.

251
00:16:59,133 --> 00:17:00,567
Where's the trainer?

252
00:17:00,567 --> 00:17:02,300
Where?

253
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:04,533
- Did you overhear? 
 - Drive.

254
00:17:04,533 --> 00:17:08,300
Driver, drive.

255
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:18,400
Turn right here.

256
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,064
- Right? 
 - Yes.

257
00:17:20,064 --> 00:17:21,567
    
 You mean to take the expressway?

258
00:17:21,567 --> 00:17:22,967
Yes.

259
00:17:22,967 --> 00:17:25,067
Where are we going?

260
00:17:25,067 --> 00:17:28,800
- Right! 
 - I got it!

261
00:17:30,633 --> 00:17:35,333
Ah, my leg hurts. Why isn't he coming?

262
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:41,400
I'm hungry, and my leg hurts.

263
00:17:43,867 --> 00:17:47,600
 Please leave a message after the beep… 

264
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:51,367
Did something really happen to him?

265
00:18:00,933 --> 00:18:04,267
I got the team doctor, so you can relax during the game.

266
00:18:04,267 --> 00:18:07,833
So don't torment her too much.

267
00:18:07,833 --> 00:18:09,833
What's this?

268
00:18:09,833 --> 00:18:13,433
I feel like you're trying to protect her.

269
00:18:13,433 --> 00:18:14,833
What are you talking about?

270
00:18:14,833 --> 00:18:19,133
Are you two dating?

271
00:18:19,133 --> 00:18:20,867
Hey, you.

272
00:18:20,867 --> 00:18:22,533
Fine, if you don't need the team doctor, forget about it.

273
00:18:22,533 --> 00:18:27,033
Just do whatever you want.

274
00:18:27,767 --> 00:18:29,867
Player Cha Si On.

275
00:18:29,867 --> 00:18:32,933
Player Cha Si On, please come in.

276
00:18:32,933 --> 00:18:36,333
I spoke to him about the hospital director. You can go in now.

277
00:18:36,333 --> 00:18:38,500
What do you think? The team doctor is quite helpful, right?

278
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:41,367
I think we are quite a good match. Don't you think?

279
00:18:41,367 --> 00:18:43,533
Disgusting! It's obvious.

280
00:18:43,533 --> 00:18:47,467
Pretending to be interested and showing off when you're not interested in me at all.

281
00:18:52,633 --> 00:18:56,700
So, will you be able to convince her by tomorrow?

282
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:58,967
Of course.

283
00:18:58,967 --> 00:19:02,700
You might as well prepare to sign a contract with me.

284
00:19:09,670 --> 00:19:11,200
Oh no.

285
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:14,567
Oh, baby.

286
00:19:14,567 --> 00:19:17,167
Ah, my baby will be all scratched up.

287
00:19:17,167 --> 00:19:18,767
It seems we are almost there.

288
00:19:18,767 --> 00:19:21,533
Baby, just hold on a little longer.

289
00:19:21,533 --> 00:19:25,600
Right, oh! Stop! Here, here!

290
00:19:30,667 --> 00:19:32,533
Hey.

291
00:19:35,133 --> 00:19:37,700
Poop smell!

292
00:19:38,667 --> 00:19:42,467
If you like the smell of poop so much, should I make you a diffuser with that?

293
00:19:42,467 --> 00:19:45,267
This is the smell of hometown.

294
00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:46,867
What would a Seoul person like you know?

295
00:19:46,867 --> 00:19:50,167
Bit rich coming from someone who lived in Italy.

296
00:19:50,167 --> 00:19:53,233
Ah, I need to exercise, but what am I doing in this nowhere village?

297
00:19:53,233 --> 00:19:54,767
Exercise?

298
00:19:54,767 --> 00:19:57,533
Grandma! Grandma, please give that to me.

299
00:19:57,533 --> 00:19:58,633
Oh no, it's heavy. You can't lift it.

300
00:19:58,633 --> 00:20:01,933
That young man will carry it for you, so please hand it over.

301
00:20:01,933 --> 00:20:02,933
Ah, okay.

302
00:20:02,933 --> 00:20:05,933
One, two, three.

303
00:20:05,933 --> 00:20:07,500
- Are you okay? 
 - Oh my.

304
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:09,267
Oh my, thank you!

305
00:20:09,267 --> 00:20:10,533
It's okay. It's not heavy at all.

306
00:20:10,533 --> 00:20:12,433
Where do you live? I'll give you a lift.

307
00:20:12,433 --> 00:20:15,833
Next to the chestnut tree over there.

308
00:20:32,967 --> 00:20:34,167
   

309
00:20:34,167 --> 00:20:36,600
Hello, Village Head!

310
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:39,267
Ah, you are here again.

311
00:20:39,267 --> 00:20:40,867
Yes, I'm here again.

312
00:20:40,867 --> 00:20:43,367
I have to keep showing up to become close.

313
00:20:43,367 --> 00:20:46,433
I said I would contact you if there was any news.

314
00:20:46,433 --> 00:20:47,967
I'm currently making inquiries.

315
00:20:47,967 --> 00:20:50,233
Because I'm in a hurry.

316
00:20:50,233 --> 00:20:53,733
The people who lived here at that time still live here. Right?

317
00:20:53,733 --> 00:20:57,500
Yes, since then there have always been 56 residents here.

318
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:59,400
55 of them are natives here.

319
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:01,833
So, did one person move away?

320
00:21:01,833 --> 00:21:03,000
Could that person be the one I'm looking for…

321
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,633
He died.

322
00:21:04,633 --> 00:21:08,967
At the age of 120, a long life, and a good death.

323
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:14,700
I'll visit and get to know all the elders in the neighborhood today, all of them!

324
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:16,700
All of them?

325
00:21:18,633 --> 00:21:21,000
Hello.

326
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,900
Hello.

327
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:26,900
Whose place is this?

328
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:28,000
This is Mr. Park's.

329
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,867
- Mr. Park, Mr. Park. 
 - If you go up that way,

330
00:21:29,867 --> 00:21:30,967
you'll find Mr. Eom's house.

331
00:21:30,967 --> 00:21:34,367
- It's Eom. 
 - Mr. Eom? Mr. Eom.

332
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:56,400
Jeon Sae Yan!

333
00:22:02,733 --> 00:22:05,667
Do I look good?

334
00:22:05,667 --> 00:22:07,233
Did you change your glasses?

335
00:22:07,233 --> 00:22:09,200
Wow.

336
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:12,200
This is my first time wearing them.

337
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:17,433
We've been like family for 3 years, that's too much.

338
00:22:17,433 --> 00:22:20,633
So, how have you been this past week?

339
00:22:20,633 --> 00:22:24,700
I feel suffocated inside. Not sure if it's pent-up anger or what.

340
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:27,800
Even if I eat rice, it doesn't seem to be digested.

341
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:31,233
Even when I drink water, I feel uncomfortable, and the same goes for when I take digestives.

342
00:22:31,233 --> 00:22:33,533
 I'm not sure whether I should take digestives or not, 

343
00:22:33,533 --> 00:22:37,500
 whether I should drink water or not… 

344
00:22:43,767 --> 00:22:45,633
 Dr. Kyeong? 

345
00:22:45,633 --> 00:22:47,600
Doctor!

346
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:50,700
Ah, yes.

347
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:53,167
Please, continue.

348
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:08,000
I've been looking for a while.

349
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,200
I convinced her to get counseling, but you're here without answering the phone?

350
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:14,700
- Did she go? 
 - She went to train with her trainer.

351
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:18,167
You missed the opportunity.

352
00:23:19,933 --> 00:23:24,067
Is there something wrong?

353
00:23:24,067 --> 00:23:27,600
Do you need to go to the agency? Let's go.

354
00:23:44,367 --> 00:23:48,400
The off-site training wasn't even proper training.

355
00:24:03,467 --> 00:24:05,400
Yeah.

356
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:08,230
Still, it's good because it keeps other thoughts away.

357
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:13,200
By the way, what is she doing here?

358
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:17,167
She's been walking around the whole neighborhood.

359
00:24:17,167 --> 00:24:19,700
Did something not go well?

360
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:23,300
This is the first time I've seen you this listless.

361
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:26,667
Were you eyes always so down-turned?

362
00:24:26,667 --> 00:24:28,067
Every time you see me,

363
00:24:28,067 --> 00:24:31,533
your eyes look like this.

364
00:24:31,533 --> 00:24:34,200
But now, your eyes completely look like this.

365
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:36,600
I'll find that person someday.

366
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,200
Well…

367
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:42,433
It seems that person ran away in fright, thinking you were looking for them.

368
00:24:43,633 --> 00:24:46,100
Is that so?

369
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:48,100
Why is she acting like that?

370
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:55,433
The water here is totally freezing.

371
00:24:55,433 --> 00:24:57,667
How is it? It's refreshing, right?

372
00:24:57,667 --> 00:24:58,933
Hey, you old pumpkin!

373
00:24:58,933 --> 00:25:01,000
- Come over here. 
 - Don't do that.

374
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,767
I'll do it. I'll do it.

375
00:25:02,767 --> 00:25:04,700
I told you not to do it!

376
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:07,233
You're going to be barefaced!

377
00:25:07,233 --> 00:25:09,500
You're going to be barefaced.

378
00:25:17,733 --> 00:25:19,933
I tried my best to cheer her up.

379
00:25:19,933 --> 00:25:22,867
Why is she so strong?

380
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:25,900
- Open the door. 
 - Can't.

381
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:27,167
- Walk all the way to Seoul. 
 - Hey, hey!

382
00:25:27,167 --> 00:25:28,967
- Bye. 
 - Hey, hey!

383
00:25:28,967 --> 00:25:30,733
Open the door.

384
00:25:30,733 --> 00:25:33,367
If you go like this, how can I get back?

385
00:25:33,367 --> 00:25:34,833
Hey, come to your senses.

386
00:25:34,833 --> 00:25:36,867
Hey, no, really!

387
00:25:36,867 --> 00:25:38,867
You know how scary my dad is, right?

388
00:25:38,867 --> 00:25:40,567
Hey!

389
00:25:40,567 --> 00:25:42,767
Hey!

390
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:59,060
♫    ♫

391
00:25:59,067 --> 00:26:00,667
Yes, hello?

392
00:26:00,667 --> 00:26:04,233
Huh? I can't hear you.

393
00:26:04,233 --> 00:26:05,600
Hello?

394
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:08,200
It seems the phone signal is bad there.

395
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,633
- What, where?
 - Unnie. 

396
00:26:09,633 --> 00:26:13,133
Can you call a taxi for me?

397
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:16,267
I'm in the countryside right now.

398
00:26:16,267 --> 00:26:20,633
I don't have any money right now.

399
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:25,667
Why did you go there?

400
00:26:25,667 --> 00:26:28,433
Looking for someone? Who? Wait.

401
00:26:28,433 --> 00:26:30,800
I'll take a taxi, so wait there.

402
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:33,467
No, it's dangerous to take a taxi alone at night.

403
00:26:33,467 --> 00:26:36,533
Don't move and wait there.

404
00:26:36,533 --> 00:26:38,467
Oh my.

405
00:26:38,467 --> 00:26:40,300
Please pull over there.

406
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:43,200
Isn't it dangerous for you to take a taxi alone?

407
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,467
We're getting on the highway.

408
00:26:44,467 --> 00:26:46,200
I don't want to owe you anything. Let me off.

409
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:49,967
I dislike being in debt and getting tangled up as well.

410
00:26:49,967 --> 00:26:53,767
Who is it that you're rushing there right away?

411
00:26:55,767 --> 00:26:59,100
I was forced into debt.

412
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:01,667
What? The watch or the bracelet?

413
00:27:01,667 --> 00:27:04,633
A wish. I'm in debt for a wish.

414
00:27:04,633 --> 00:27:10,067
And no matter how much of a line I draw, she's the one who comes into that line.

415
00:27:10,067 --> 00:27:13,667
There's someone who can bring down your iron wall.

416
00:27:13,667 --> 00:27:16,167
I wonder who that person is.

417
00:27:32,367 --> 00:27:36,100
Will I be able to meet that person again?

418
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,800
Is it always like this here, with no lights or people?

419
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:48,400
It's so dark that if someone were buried here, no one would know.

420
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:51,800
It would be perfect for a movie location.

421
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:58,600
Why did you stop the car all of a sudden?

422
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:00,767
Wow, that was startling.

423
00:28:00,767 --> 00:28:04,133
Let's take a short break before we go.

424
00:28:04,133 --> 00:28:08,367
Take a break? Here? Why?

425
00:28:10,867 --> 00:28:14,567
Would you mind closing your eyes for a moment?

426
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,533
Why should I close my eyes? What are you going to do?

427
00:28:19,533 --> 00:28:20,700
No lights, no people.

428
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:22,533
In a place where no one would know if anything happens.

429
00:28:22,533 --> 00:28:25,167
Oh my, it's funny.

430
00:28:25,833 --> 00:28:27,867
Then do as you wish.

431
00:28:29,467 --> 00:28:30,733
Okay, okay, I've closed them.

432
00:28:30,733 --> 00:28:33,167
So, what are you going to do?

433
00:28:33,167 --> 00:28:36,367
Why did you stop the car suddenly, lower your voice, and tell me to close my eyes?

434
00:28:36,367 --> 00:28:40,567
Are we filming a romance or something?

435
00:28:45,133 --> 00:28:46,333
Did you leave?

436
00:28:46,333 --> 00:28:49,033
Excuse me.

437
00:28:49,033 --> 00:28:50,700
Are you opening the trunk?

438
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:53,233
I'm opening my eyes!

439
00:29:02,333 --> 00:29:05,033
What? What is he taking out?

440
00:29:05,033 --> 00:29:07,267
A shovel?

441
00:29:10,233 --> 00:29:12,300
Oh, my gosh.

442
00:29:15,267 --> 00:29:17,567
He saw me. He saw me.

443
00:29:17,567 --> 00:29:20,700
Oh no, it must be me, it must be me.

444
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:22,967
Raise up the window!

445
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:27,133
What are you doing?

446
00:29:27,133 --> 00:29:29,500
What are you doing?

447
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:32,333
- Can't you see? 
 - I'm asking because I don't want to know.

448
00:29:32,333 --> 00:29:34,467
Who are you going to bury with the shovel?

449
00:29:34,467 --> 00:29:36,900
Come out for a second. Come out, please.

450
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:41,067
Tell me with words. Put that down first.

451
00:29:49,633 --> 00:29:54,267
There's an animal killed in a road accident, so I'm going to bury it.

452
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:10,733
Although you died a lonely death in this life,

453
00:30:10,733 --> 00:30:14,067
I hope you live a long, healthy

454
00:30:14,067 --> 00:30:16,300
and happy life in your next life.

455
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:19,267
I guess animals are an exception.

456
00:30:19,267 --> 00:30:21,367
You're cold to people.

457
00:30:27,767 --> 00:30:30,000
Hello…

458
00:30:31,333 --> 00:30:32,333
Hello?

459
00:30:32,333 --> 00:30:34,600
Ju Yeon, I've taken a car heading to Seoul.

460
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:36,200
What? Whose car?

461
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:38,600
Why did you just take any car?

462
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:42,267
No, I just happened to meet someone I knew.

463
00:30:42,267 --> 00:30:43,600
Someone you know?

464
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:47,867
Anyway, the important thing is I'm going back to Seoul. See you in Seoul.

465
00:30:48,433 --> 00:30:50,233
What a relief.

466
00:30:50,233 --> 00:30:52,500
Did she…

467
00:30:53,367 --> 00:30:57,500
I'm sorry, but I just have to go back to Seoul.

468
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:07,733
I came back because I had something to ask.

469
00:31:07,733 --> 00:31:10,133
Who exactly are you looking for?

470
00:31:10,133 --> 00:31:11,600
What will you do with that?

471
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,067
I don't know.

472
00:31:13,067 --> 00:31:14,700
It might be someone I know.

473
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:17,200
I also have ties here.

474
00:31:19,133 --> 00:31:21,667
The person I love.

475
00:31:22,667 --> 00:31:25,367
That person used to live here when I was young.

476
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:35,500
   

477
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,567
Aren't you going to eat?

478
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:52,333
My dad was also a doctor.

479
00:31:52,333 --> 00:31:54,033
A psychiatrist.

480
00:31:54,033 --> 00:31:58,033
Dad didn't see each patient as just a patient

481
00:31:58,033 --> 00:32:03,233
but approached them with his own emotions as if it were his own matter.

482
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,433
 - Sir…  
 - Patients came before his family.

483
00:32:06,433 --> 00:32:08,400
 - Be sure to visit the health center. 
 - Yes, I will for sure. 

484
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:10,500
And then…

485
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:22,500
I wanted to show that I was different from my dad.

486
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:25,267
I kept distance from the patients

487
00:32:25,267 --> 00:32:29,400
and kept them away in case emotions developed.

488
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:30,800
But…

489
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:34,767
 I feel suffocated, so is this frustration or what? 

490
00:32:34,767 --> 00:32:38,600
I saw my reflection in the patient's glasses.

491
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:42,267
"I'm not interested in your story, so get it over with and leave."

492
00:32:42,267 --> 00:32:44,233
"When will this story end?"

493
00:32:44,233 --> 00:32:48,633
"You'll never get better so just talk accordingly and then get up."

494
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:55,267
This patient might have

495
00:32:55,267 --> 00:32:58,333
thought of me as a glimmer of hope.

496
00:32:58,333 --> 00:33:02,733
Who could open their heart and talk to someone like me?

497
00:33:02,733 --> 00:33:05,800
To people who brought bad memories,

498
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:09,433
I wonder if I'm becoming another bad memory.

499
00:33:13,833 --> 00:33:16,267
The player Si On is right.

500
00:33:16,267 --> 00:33:19,567
I used to talk as if I knew something

501
00:33:19,567 --> 00:33:22,333
even though I wasn't even interested and knew nothing.

502
00:33:23,867 --> 00:33:27,833
To a person who is self-blaming like this,

503
00:33:27,833 --> 00:33:30,500
what words would you offer?

504
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:34,767
In this case, the only thing I can do for you is

505
00:33:34,767 --> 00:33:40,300
to survey all your patients, create big data,

506
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:45,300
and then prove that it is not true.

507
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,400
You don't need to do anything.

508
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:50,433
It's just…

509
00:33:50,433 --> 00:33:55,567
It's just frustrating, and speaking out makes me feel at least a bit relieved.

510
00:33:58,667 --> 00:34:03,300
Just like you, they feel the same.

511
00:34:05,067 --> 00:34:10,133
Just being by their sides is comforting.

512
00:34:10,133 --> 00:34:12,867
Just by being there,

513
00:34:14,567 --> 00:34:16,867
there's nothing more to wish for.

514
00:34:16,867 --> 00:34:21,467
That will be enough for them, too.

515
00:34:21,467 --> 00:34:23,400
Certainly.

516
00:34:32,067 --> 00:34:34,333
Oh, it's hot.

517
00:34:34,333 --> 00:34:36,500
Why is it suddenly so hot?

518
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:39,567
I need to open a window.

519
00:34:49,967 --> 00:34:50,967
No.

520
00:34:50,967 --> 00:34:53,133
It's the smell of the countryside. It's the smell of cow's poop.

521
00:34:53,133 --> 00:34:55,033
This is because I opened the window. You know that, right?

522
00:34:55,033 --> 00:34:57,133
You know it's absolutely not me, right?

523
00:34:57,133 --> 00:35:00,033
A smell that wasn't here for a while is suddenly emerging.

524
00:35:00,033 --> 00:35:01,667
The wind! It's because of the wind.

525
00:35:01,667 --> 00:35:04,700
The wind is blowing this way just like this.

526
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:05,867
Let's assume that's true.

527
00:35:05,867 --> 00:35:08,500
That's not it, no. This isn't it.

528
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:09,700
I don't smell like this.

529
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:11,967
- Yes, let's say that. 
 - I'm telling you, it's not me.

530
00:35:11,967 --> 00:35:13,200
- Yes, I got it. 
 - Ah, it drives me crazy.

531
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:14,700
- We're leaving. 
 - Let's go now.

532
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:16,933
Yes.

533
00:35:16,933 --> 00:35:21,670
It's not me. It's not me.

534
00:35:21,670 --> 00:35:24,767
 ­  

535
00:35:24,767 --> 00:35:26,533
Thank you for giving me a ride.

536
00:35:26,533 --> 00:35:30,533
Ju Yeon, let's meet at the stadium tomorrow.

537
00:35:30,533 --> 00:35:32,233
Tomorrow might be the last day.

538
00:35:32,233 --> 00:35:36,567
Don't be quick to judge the results.

539
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:50,600
Sis!

540
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:55,100
Who is it? A man?

541
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:57,233
Ah, that is…

542
00:35:57,233 --> 00:35:58,300
Hey, you!

543
00:35:58,300 --> 00:36:01,467
Why did you go there without any plan?

544
00:36:01,467 --> 00:36:02,733
Because of you…

545
00:36:02,733 --> 00:36:05,433
Oh my.

546
00:36:05,433 --> 00:36:07,600
First, I got scolded by your mother.

547
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:10,033
Secondly, I got scolded by Seung Hyun.

548
00:36:10,033 --> 00:36:13,000
And now, I've been scolded by you.

549
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,467
I feel like… f-amily! 
 (The way she pauses sounds like a swear word.)

550
00:36:15,467 --> 00:36:19,133
What? Did you just curse?

551
00:36:19,133 --> 00:36:20,667
I said we're like family.

552
00:36:20,667 --> 00:36:24,400
Actually, I didn't grow up receiving this kind of attention.

553
00:36:25,133 --> 00:36:28,633
Let's go. Your mom is making pumpkin porridge.

554
00:36:28,633 --> 00:36:30,067
Try it once more.

555
00:36:30,067 --> 00:36:31,000
What?

556
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,167
- You. 
 - What?

557
00:36:32,167 --> 00:36:34,033
You didn't even answer the phone.

558
00:36:49,667 --> 00:36:58,100
♫  Being with the worries that cling to me  ♫

559
00:36:58,100 --> 00:37:02,400
♫  Makes the dark night even darker  ♫

560
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:06,467
♫  Always  ♫

561
00:37:06,467 --> 00:37:15,067
♫  As the day sets, still breaking  ♫

562
00:37:15,067 --> 00:37:22,833
♫  The only thing that shines through these repeating days  ♫

563
00:37:22,833 --> 00:37:29,867
♫  It's you  ♫

564
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:38,633
♫  It's you  ♫

565
00:37:39,433 --> 00:37:46,400
♫  It's you  ♫

566
00:37:47,933 --> 00:37:54,933
♫  It's you  ♫

567
00:37:55,767 --> 00:38:00,900
♫   I start and end every day alone   ♫

568
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:04,900
♫  The warmth of you goes around  ♫

569
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:08,933
♫  If only we could be peaceful  ♫

570
00:38:08,933 --> 00:38:15,500
♫   And beautiful by those words    ♫

571
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:21,633
   

572
00:38:32,567 --> 00:38:35,067
Have you fallen for me?

573
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:37,630
 ­  

574
00:38:37,633 --> 00:38:40,900
I was wondering who walks around pretending to be cool like this.

575
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:42,700
It's not that I'm trying to act cool.

576
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:48,060
I am just cool.

577
00:38:48,060 --> 00:38:50,300
 ­  

578
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:52,167
Sir.

579
00:38:52,167 --> 00:38:53,967
I will devote my whole body

580
00:38:53,967 --> 00:38:55,533
and work hard as a national team coach,

581
00:38:55,533 --> 00:38:57,400
giving my all for infinite glory.

582
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:58,833
Good, good.

583
00:38:58,833 --> 00:39:00,300
- Thank you. 
 - Yes, yes.

584
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:03,133
Thank you.

585
00:39:03,133 --> 00:39:03,967
You are here.

586
00:39:03,967 --> 00:39:06,867
Hey, you said you weren't coming.

587
00:39:06,867 --> 00:39:08,000
Sir.

588
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,100
From the player Cha Si On's agency.

589
00:39:15,867 --> 00:39:19,000
Yes, excuse me.

590
00:39:23,633 --> 00:39:25,433
Doctor?

591
00:39:26,267 --> 00:39:27,933
Isn't it?

592
00:39:30,967 --> 00:39:34,967
Go for it, go for it!

593
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,333
Player Lee Shin.

594
00:39:39,333 --> 00:39:42,533
Why didn't you come to lunch yesterday?

595
00:39:50,967 --> 00:39:52,867
Wear it.

596
00:39:54,067 --> 00:39:57,433
I put on a talisman for good luck.

597
00:39:57,433 --> 00:39:59,600
Fighting!

598
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:11,500
Why isn't he coming?

599
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:15,233
Player Cha Si On, you're up in 10 minutes.

600
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:30,767
Cha Si On, go for it!

601
00:40:30,767 --> 00:40:33,700
- Go for it. 
 - Cha Si On, go for it.

602
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:50,733
Little cutie, are you okay?

603
00:40:51,333 --> 00:40:53,333
Why is she like this?

604
00:40:53,333 --> 00:40:54,467
Oh my, Si On.

605
00:40:54,467 --> 00:40:55,933
Si On.

606
00:40:55,933 --> 00:40:57,300
Cha Si On, Cha Si On.

607
00:40:57,300 --> 00:40:59,667
Where's the ambulance? Ambulance!

608
00:40:59,667 --> 00:41:02,533
Call an ambulance, quickly!

609
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:26,133
Since we're the only ones here, get up.

610
00:41:31,467 --> 00:41:34,967
I really felt dizzy earlier.

611
00:41:38,967 --> 00:41:42,533
Everyone says to cheer up. Right?

612
00:41:42,533 --> 00:41:43,700
Don't cheer up.

613
00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:44,733
What?

614
00:41:44,733 --> 00:41:46,367
I said, don't cheer up.

615
00:41:46,367 --> 00:41:49,933
Are you bad-mouthing me because I don't work with you right now?

616
00:41:49,933 --> 00:41:54,667
Whenever you start something, you hear 'cheer up' the most. Right?

617
00:41:56,233 --> 00:41:58,967
It's okay to be lacking, and it's okay to be clumsy.

618
00:41:58,967 --> 00:42:01,433
It's okay not to cheer up.

619
00:42:01,433 --> 00:42:03,067
You might not do well today.

620
00:42:03,067 --> 00:42:06,733
Just being there has its own meaning.

621
00:42:06,733 --> 00:42:10,867
You only have to do as much as you can and as much as you've done.

622
00:42:10,867 --> 00:42:14,960
So let's not cheer up.

623
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:18,700
Still, everyone has their expectations.

624
00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:20,400
Others have their own lives.

625
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:23,400
As long as your own expectations are not disappointed, that's fine.

626
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:27,500
If I do badly, who would want to sign a contract with me?

627
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:30,100
I'm here for you, little cutie.

628
00:42:30,100 --> 00:42:31,400
Mister?

629
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:35,900
Where do you want to go? Just tell me.

630
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:48,840
   

631
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:58,467
This is the extent of my territory.

632
00:42:58,467 --> 00:43:00,067
The court is your territory.

633
00:43:00,067 --> 00:43:01,700
Is this really what you want?

634
00:43:01,700 --> 00:43:04,400
Even if it doesn't work out, you have to try.

635
00:43:05,567 --> 00:43:07,767
I'll go.

636
00:43:16,467 --> 00:43:19,867
So you've been preparing the big data for the whole night?

637
00:43:19,867 --> 00:43:21,400
But why didn't you tell me?

638
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:23,667
The national team should be composed of the best players.

639
00:43:23,667 --> 00:43:28,700
With her skills, she'll never make it to the national team.

640
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:31,567
- Doubles? 
 - As you know.

641
00:43:31,567 --> 00:43:34,100
Player Cha Si On's specialty is the volley.

642
00:43:34,100 --> 00:43:38,700
No one can match her in net play.

643
00:43:40,133 --> 00:43:43,567
Here are the rehabilitation doctor's opinion and big data.

644
00:43:46,333 --> 00:43:48,700
If she teams up with the player I recommend,

645
00:43:48,700 --> 00:43:52,467
there will surely be a chance of winning.

646
00:43:53,300 --> 00:43:57,533
The doubles players already have their teams.

647
00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:01,133
But there's a new doubles player.

648
00:44:04,033 --> 00:44:06,267
You called for me…

649
00:44:07,100 --> 00:44:11,100
So, is she playing doubles with Player Lee Shin?

650
00:44:11,100 --> 00:44:12,733
Yes.

651
00:44:12,733 --> 00:44:16,833
Since they can compensate for each other's weaknesses if they play mixed doubles.

652
00:44:16,833 --> 00:44:19,433
It will be the most ideal combination.

653
00:44:19,433 --> 00:44:23,533
What's left is up to the players.

654
00:44:25,167 --> 00:44:28,933
Both of us are dependent on Player Si On for employment.

655
00:44:28,933 --> 00:44:31,600
Indeed.

656
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:35,700
Simple labor is the best when you're anxious.

657
00:44:35,700 --> 00:44:38,567
- What is this? 
 - It's a wish bracelet.

658
00:44:38,567 --> 00:44:42,167
Don't call it childish. If you say that, you'll get bad luck.

659
00:44:43,233 --> 00:44:45,567
Why are you making this now?

660
00:44:45,567 --> 00:44:47,800
You don't need to know.

661
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:49,333
Ah, the length is…

662
00:44:49,333 --> 00:44:52,000
Hold on. Give me your arm for a second.

663
00:44:55,733 --> 00:44:59,200
Ah, superstitions

664
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:02,133
can be useful at times. Right?

665
00:45:02,133 --> 00:45:03,500
Grab the end here for a moment.

666
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:04,767
Oh, of course.

667
00:45:04,767 --> 00:45:08,133
The design is pretty too, right?

668
00:45:08,133 --> 00:45:10,533
This is decent.

669
00:45:11,300 --> 00:45:12,833
- Hold on, just a sec. 
 - No, don't move.

670
00:45:12,833 --> 00:45:15,100
I said don't move. It's coming loose.

671
00:45:15,100 --> 00:45:18,000
Oh, I'll take it out for you.

672
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:22,900
This one feels like a receipt.

673
00:45:24,933 --> 00:45:28,367
Oh dear, it's cut off.

674
00:45:29,033 --> 00:45:32,433
A receipt for a phone charger?

675
00:45:32,433 --> 00:45:35,133
Oh, that charger, you did buy it!

676
00:45:35,133 --> 00:45:36,800
Let's see the date.

677
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:40,467
Stop! Be careful with physical contact.

678
00:45:40,467 --> 00:45:42,467
Why aren't you showing it to me?

679
00:45:42,467 --> 00:45:44,333
- Let me take a look at this. 
 - No, no.

680
00:45:44,333 --> 00:45:47,867
Seriously, no physical contact is allowed; it's prohibited.

681
00:45:47,867 --> 00:45:49,867
If that's what you bought, you know you're hiring me. Right?

682
00:45:49,867 --> 00:45:51,467
- Let me see. 
 - Oh, that.

683
00:45:51,467 --> 00:45:56,967
If you do this, I might end up really liking you again.

684
00:46:02,667 --> 00:46:05,400
Does that scare you?

685
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:24,600
I got a phone call.

686
00:46:25,667 --> 00:46:27,433
 Hello? Hello? 

687
00:46:27,433 --> 00:46:28,933
 Mister. 

688
00:46:28,933 --> 00:46:30,600
Yes, cutie.

689
00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:34,810
Oh, right! So how did it go?

690
00:46:35,367 --> 00:46:37,033
Yes.

691
00:46:37,033 --> 00:46:39,900
Yes!

692
00:46:42,367 --> 00:46:45,933
Ah, yes, congratulations.

693
00:46:45,933 --> 00:46:48,867
And what about the team doctor?

694
00:46:48,867 --> 00:46:52,033
What do you want to do?

695
00:46:52,033 --> 00:46:53,633
If you never want to see her again,

696
00:46:53,633 --> 00:46:57,667
it's totally unacceptable, we'll find another team doctor.

697
00:46:57,667 --> 00:47:01,567
 Mister, do as you like. It doesn't matter. 

698
00:47:01,567 --> 00:47:03,667
Ah, okay.

699
00:47:03,667 --> 00:47:07,300
Yes, yes, all right.

700
00:47:09,100 --> 00:47:11,933
What did she say? What about me?

701
00:47:13,233 --> 00:47:14,667
I don't know.

702
00:47:14,667 --> 00:47:15,933
What?

703
00:47:15,933 --> 00:47:18,367
Well, what did she say?

704
00:47:19,767 --> 00:47:21,233
I don't know.

705
00:47:21,233 --> 00:47:23,433
Why won't you tell me?

706
00:47:23,433 --> 00:47:26,633
Just a minute. Let's go together.

707
00:47:26,633 --> 00:47:27,567
Oh my.

708
00:47:27,567 --> 00:47:28,633
Ah, hey!

709
00:47:28,633 --> 00:47:31,267
I heard you're playing doubles with Si On.

710
00:47:31,267 --> 00:47:35,667
You said you hated playing doubles? What made you change your mind?

711
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:39,667
Because there is nothing else I can do.

712
00:47:39,667 --> 00:47:42,033
No.

713
00:47:42,033 --> 00:47:44,650
I shouldn't be the one doing this.

714
00:47:45,867 --> 00:47:49,100
Because that's the only thing I can do for them.

715
00:47:49,100 --> 00:47:52,567
For whom? Cha Si On?

716
00:47:52,567 --> 00:47:55,800
Or is it for Kun?

717
00:48:04,933 --> 00:48:06,533
I guessed it right.

718
00:48:06,533 --> 00:48:11,300
That's the doctor that Kun was with at the hospital. Right?

719
00:48:14,133 --> 00:48:16,800
Are you really not going to tell me?

720
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:18,233
That's a violation of the bet.

721
00:48:18,233 --> 00:48:20,567
You should go home now.

722
00:48:20,567 --> 00:48:22,700
Home?

723
00:48:24,300 --> 00:48:27,600
You'll be busy starting work from tomorrow.

724
00:48:28,767 --> 00:48:32,167
Did Player Si On ask to hire me?

725
00:48:34,300 --> 00:48:36,400
I won the bet. Right?

726
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:38,133
Oh, that little cutie.

727
00:48:38,133 --> 00:48:41,467
She doesn't know how to distinguish a good person.

728
00:48:43,267 --> 00:48:45,333
Thank you.

729
00:48:48,967 --> 00:48:52,700
Kun laughs really well.

730
00:48:52,700 --> 00:48:55,967
She's that doctor, right?

731
00:48:57,667 --> 00:49:00,033
His attending physician,

732
00:49:00,033 --> 00:49:02,567
the team doctor,

733
00:49:03,433 --> 00:49:05,300
and his first love.

734
00:49:06,700 --> 00:49:08,567
First love?

735
00:49:14,233 --> 00:49:16,433
What's going on?

736
00:49:17,600 --> 00:49:19,100
Congratulations.

737
00:49:19,100 --> 00:49:21,433
Congratulations.

738
00:49:22,300 --> 00:49:25,933
Ma'am, can I go to the first meeting

739
00:49:25,933 --> 00:49:28,267
between the coach and Si On?

740
00:49:30,900 --> 00:49:35,300
Please take good care of Si On, CEO Lee Kun.

741
00:49:35,300 --> 00:49:38,367
Si On, see you later at home.

742
00:49:38,367 --> 00:49:40,533
Ma'am, the promise you made with me.

743
00:49:40,533 --> 00:49:42,333
CEO Hong.

744
00:49:42,333 --> 00:49:47,267
If it weren't for you, I would have prepared just a hunger strike.

745
00:49:47,267 --> 00:49:50,433
Thank you very much.

746
00:49:53,300 --> 00:49:55,433
Yes.

747
00:49:55,433 --> 00:49:57,733
There are plenty of other players.

748
00:49:57,733 --> 00:50:01,300
Try to do well with just Cha Si On.

749
00:50:01,300 --> 00:50:02,833
Let's go.

750
00:50:02,833 --> 00:50:04,467
Ah, wait a moment.

751
00:50:04,467 --> 00:50:06,333
By the way,

752
00:50:07,233 --> 00:50:10,533
doesn't it smell like poop?

753
00:50:15,833 --> 00:50:18,267
Is the smell coming from here?

754
00:50:52,833 --> 00:50:54,733
Little cutie.

755
00:50:55,500 --> 00:50:57,633
Let's go.

756
00:51:03,500 --> 00:51:05,733
No, no. Someone who can do it right now.

757
00:51:05,733 --> 00:51:09,367
Okay, then. Look into it and contact me immediately.

758
00:51:09,367 --> 00:51:10,933
Hey, Kun.

759
00:51:10,933 --> 00:51:12,633
Oh, did Lee Shin come?

760
00:51:12,633 --> 00:51:14,433
That's not what's important right now.

761
00:51:14,433 --> 00:51:16,033
I think you can't have the coach's meeting today.

762
00:51:16,033 --> 00:51:18,900
- Why? 
 - The interpreter left after working for today.

763
00:51:18,900 --> 00:51:22,133
Saying that the coach was impossible to deal with.

764
00:51:22,133 --> 00:51:22,833
What did the association say?

765
00:51:22,833 --> 00:51:25,667
They're in a frenzy looking for an interpreter right now.

766
00:51:25,667 --> 00:51:28,840
But how can they find the interpreter at this hour?

767
00:51:29,433 --> 00:51:32,700
Little cutie, go ahead first.

768
00:51:33,500 --> 00:51:35,433
Go ahead.

769
00:51:35,433 --> 00:51:37,900
Can't the coach speak English? I can do it in English.

770
00:51:37,900 --> 00:51:39,967
He said he needs an Italian interpreter.

771
00:51:39,967 --> 00:51:44,467
- Italian? 
 - You just wait for now.

772
00:51:44,467 --> 00:51:46,133
- Yes. 
 - Yes, hello?

773
00:51:46,133 --> 00:51:47,933
Hey.

774
00:51:51,667 --> 00:51:55,100
Thanks to you, I'm one step closer to my wish.

775
00:51:55,100 --> 00:51:56,767
Thanks to this bracelet.

776
00:51:56,767 --> 00:52:00,400
The wish comes true when the bracelet breaks.

777
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:05,033
But the bracelet helps you get closer to your wish, one step at a time.

778
00:52:05,033 --> 00:52:06,833
Right?

779
00:52:06,833 --> 00:52:08,800
So,

780
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:14,700
I picked it up on the way.

781
00:52:14,700 --> 00:52:16,967
Mama mia!

782
00:52:16,967 --> 00:52:19,267
My heart is racing.

783
00:52:19,267 --> 00:52:21,333
It's burdensome. It's too much.

784
00:52:21,333 --> 00:52:23,167
It's awesome.

785
00:52:23,167 --> 00:52:26,433
So, is this a couple's bracelet then?

786
00:52:28,033 --> 00:52:29,000
Put the bracelet on me.

787
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,333
I have to do that for you?

788
00:52:31,867 --> 00:52:37,467
I made it while looking at the manual, but I'm not sure if it's made properly.

789
00:52:40,100 --> 00:52:43,833
Please make sure I can find that person.

790
00:52:43,833 --> 00:52:46,367
Do you wish to find something?

791
00:52:46,367 --> 00:52:48,200
Yes.

792
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:51,600
I'm actually looking for someone.

793
00:52:51,600 --> 00:52:53,067
Someone? Who?

794
00:52:53,067 --> 00:52:55,367
I…

795
00:52:55,367 --> 00:52:57,320
Just a moment.

796
00:52:57,900 --> 00:52:58,900
Who is it?

797
00:52:58,900 --> 00:53:00,300
 The national fairy. 

798
00:53:00,300 --> 00:53:02,433
Ah, Player Si On.

799
00:53:02,433 --> 00:53:05,200
I sincerely congratulate you on becoming a national team member.

800
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:06,433
Did you meet the coach?

801
00:53:06,433 --> 00:53:08,833
I'm still alone.

802
00:53:08,833 --> 00:53:11,367
The CEO went to the car to get my bag.

803
00:53:11,367 --> 00:53:15,767
I was only a little nervous earlier,

804
00:53:15,767 --> 00:53:19,100
 but the meeting as been pushed back, so I'm getting more and more nervous. 

805
00:53:19,100 --> 00:53:20,833
What should I do in this situation?

806
00:53:20,833 --> 00:53:23,267
There's a delay? Was there an incident?

807
00:53:23,267 --> 00:53:26,300
 I heard that the interpreter ran away, or something. 

808
00:53:26,300 --> 00:53:29,920
They're in a frenzy here trying to find an Italian interpreter.

809
00:54:05,567 --> 00:54:09,700
I have never worked a day in my life since I was born.

810
00:54:09,700 --> 00:54:11,233
Can I do well?

811
00:54:11,233 --> 00:54:14,100
Your Italian pronunciation was so good last time.

812
00:54:14,100 --> 00:54:16,600
They will probably pay you a daily wage.

813
00:54:20,367 --> 00:54:22,733
Come here.

814
00:54:22,733 --> 00:54:26,700
- Excuse me, you're Kun's friend. Right? 
 - Yes.

815
00:54:26,700 --> 00:54:28,600
I've brought an interpreter. Where should I take her?

816
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:30,033
- An interpreter? 
 - Yes.

817
00:54:30,033 --> 00:54:31,367
- Interpreter. 
 - Are you the interpreter?

818
00:54:31,367 --> 00:54:32,600
- Yes. 
 - Come quickly, this way.

819
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:33,867
- What? Oh, yes. 
 - Yes, quickly, hurry.

820
00:54:33,867 --> 00:54:36,967
Just a moment. I'll come back after earning a lot of money.

821
00:54:36,967 --> 00:54:40,133
Come quickly.

822
00:54:40,133 --> 00:54:44,133
Excuse me, let's talk for a moment.

823
00:54:51,467 --> 00:54:53,500
We're short on time, so let's keep it brief.

824
00:54:53,500 --> 00:54:57,067
- Please don't loiter around Kun anymore. 
 - What?

825
00:54:57,067 --> 00:55:00,700
Doctor, you know very well how difficult Kun

826
00:55:00,700 --> 00:55:03,600
has been living all this time. Right?

827
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:06,033
You probably know why he threw himself

828
00:55:06,033 --> 00:55:09,967
into the Han River after the alumni reunion.

829
00:55:09,967 --> 00:55:14,700
I'm sure you know because I told you that it's because of his first love.

830
00:55:14,700 --> 00:55:17,400
Oh, that… Are you worried that

831
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:20,800
since I'm his first love, he might regain his past memories?

832
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:24,233
If that's the case, I'll do my best to be by his side so that he doesn't regain memories.

833
00:55:24,233 --> 00:55:26,033
That's really shameless.

834
00:55:26,033 --> 00:55:27,800
You can't be by his side.

835
00:55:27,800 --> 00:55:30,567
Because it'll be hard for all three of you.

836
00:55:30,567 --> 00:55:32,500
All three?

837
00:55:32,500 --> 00:55:35,700
Kun, you, and…

838
00:55:35,700 --> 00:55:39,080
 Where are you? Did you find your first love? 

839
00:55:39,900 --> 00:55:43,533
 Yes, I found her, thankfully. 

840
00:55:43,533 --> 00:55:46,667
 I shouldn't ask for more. 

841
00:55:47,467 --> 00:55:49,533
 - That's how it should be. 
 - Did you pretend to know her? 

842
00:55:49,533 --> 00:55:50,933
 Hey, you should go and confess to her. 

843
00:55:50,933 --> 00:55:55,433
 But she was already with someone else. 

844
00:55:58,533 --> 00:56:00,000
 It was taken away again. 

845
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,800
 Taken away? To whom? 

846
00:56:02,800 --> 00:56:04,467
Lee Shin.

847
00:56:04,467 --> 00:56:07,733
 Taken by someone close. 

848
00:56:07,733 --> 00:56:09,600
 That person… 

849
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:11,700
Please stop making Kun suffer anymore.

850
00:56:11,700 --> 00:56:15,233
Please quit being a team doctor and his doctor in charge and leave him alone.

851
00:56:15,233 --> 00:56:16,700
Between the two brothers…

852
00:56:16,700 --> 00:56:18,800
What are you talking about?

853
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:21,267
Player Lee Shin.

854
00:56:21,267 --> 00:56:24,933
Are you saying that Dr. Kyeong and I have some kind of relationship?

855
00:56:25,700 --> 00:56:27,967
What are you two doing now?

856
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:31,033
Are you denying it now?

857
00:56:31,033 --> 00:56:34,333
You, on the day of Kun's accident.

858
00:56:34,333 --> 00:56:36,767
The alumni reunion.

859
00:56:36,767 --> 00:56:38,867
Don't you remember?

860
00:56:41,767 --> 00:56:44,967
   

861
00:56:54,420 --> 00:56:56,060
 ­  

862
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:06,500
The place in that memory was here.

863
00:57:07,833 --> 00:57:12,400
Then, that memory wasn't a fantasy?

864
00:57:49,633 --> 00:57:51,500
Kun saw everything.

865
00:57:51,500 --> 00:57:54,400
That day, you and his first love

866
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:56,567
were together.

867
00:58:32,767 --> 00:58:35,700
 If the person I kissed that day 

868
00:58:35,700 --> 00:58:38,000
 was my brother's first love, 

869
00:58:39,400 --> 00:58:41,670
 it wasn't you. 

870
00:58:42,167 --> 00:58:46,680
 Then, my brother's first love is… 

871
00:58:47,390 --> 00:58:55,260


872
00:58:56,133 --> 00:58:59,767
Hello, I am Jeon Sae Yan, your interpreter for the day.

873
00:59:02,033 --> 00:59:04,133
Please take care of me.

874
00:59:06,800 --> 00:59:08,967
Nice to meet you.

875
00:59:11,567 --> 00:59:20,700
♫  Drowning, drowning in an ocean of grey ♫

876
00:59:22,967 --> 00:59:26,533
♫  Running, running  ♫

877
00:59:26,533 --> 00:59:32,733
♫  Running backwards to you  ♫

878
00:59:34,567 --> 00:59:43,467
♫  Drowning, drowning in an ocean of grey  ♫

879
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:52,067
   

880
00:59:52,067 --> 00:59:53,433
 Haven't we met each other somewhere before? 

881
00:59:53,433 --> 00:59:54,533
 Your face looks familiar. 

882
00:59:54,533 --> 00:59:56,533
 So that my brother's bad memories won't come back. 

883
00:59:56,533 --> 00:59:58,233
 Cooperation, let's do that. 

884
00:59:58,233 --> 01:00:00,700
 Why would you tell a lie that's bound to get find out? 

885
01:00:00,700 --> 01:00:03,233
 If you haven't committed a crime, why are you running out barefoot? 

886
01:00:03,233 --> 01:00:04,833
 Staying up all night with me is not a big sin. 

887
01:00:04,833 --> 01:00:06,633
 I should go to where that woman is. 

888
01:00:06,633 --> 01:00:09,333
 Have you ever seen Kun's past diary? 

889
01:00:09,333 --> 01:00:11,167
 Everything about me will be written there. 

890
01:00:11,167 --> 01:00:12,333
 I need to find it first. 

891
01:00:12,333 --> 01:00:15,400
 I know now why you tried to cover up your brother's accident. 

892
01:00:15,400 --> 01:00:17,233
 Is he going around investigating the accident? 

893
01:00:17,233 --> 01:00:18,700
 Which one is right? 

894
01:00:18,700 --> 01:00:21,400
 Is it Lee Shin's memory, or my lingering memory? 

895
01:00:21,400 --> 01:00:24,120
 What happened that night? 

896
01:00:24,120 --> 01:00:27,100
♫   Someone else  ♫
