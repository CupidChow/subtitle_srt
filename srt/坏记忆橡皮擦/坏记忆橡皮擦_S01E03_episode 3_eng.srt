1
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:07,990
 ­  

2
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:14,650
 ­  

3
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:18,360
   

4
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:23,190
   

5
00:00:25,533 --> 00:00:33,400
   

6
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:39,267
   

7
00:00:39,267 --> 00:00:41,467
- She's amazing. 
 - I know.

8
00:00:41,467 --> 00:00:43,400
In that short time…

9
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:45,667
- She doesn't even have time to sleep, but when… 
 - I know.

10
00:00:45,667 --> 00:00:48,470
- Let's try our best. 
 - Yeah.

11
00:00:48,470 --> 00:00:53,760


12
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,233
 Every day is full of exciting things. 

13
00:01:01,733 --> 00:01:04,700
 The world surrounding me 

14
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:07,800
 is full of beautiful things. 

15
00:01:20,467 --> 00:01:23,267
 Every moment I live and breathe 

16
00:01:23,267 --> 00:01:26,167
 feels like it's all mine, so... 

17
00:01:26,967 --> 00:01:30,433
I'm so happy every day.

18
00:01:30,433 --> 00:01:32,633
That's because...

19
00:01:33,333 --> 00:01:34,867
you're next to me.

20
00:01:34,867 --> 00:01:36,767
I'm so happy

21
00:01:36,767 --> 00:01:40,300
that you're my first love.

22
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:43,867
Even though the world is in half and my heart is in half,

23
00:01:43,867 --> 00:01:45,433
you are my first love.

24
00:01:45,433 --> 00:01:48,800
Can you feel it? Or can you see it?

25
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,533
Will you be able to see it if I do this?

26
00:01:50,533 --> 00:01:52,433
My heart is on fire.

27
00:01:52,433 --> 00:01:54,400
Ju Yeon.

28
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,800
Ju Yeon.

29
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:58,867
Ju Yeon. Ju Yeon.

30
00:01:58,867 --> 00:02:03,633
   

31
00:02:03,633 --> 00:02:07,600
   

32
00:02:15,767 --> 00:02:18,367
   

33
00:02:24,733 --> 00:02:28,367
Is it real? It's not a joke, right?

34
00:02:28,367 --> 00:02:31,967
I lost weight because I was so anxious.

35
00:02:31,967 --> 00:02:33,100
You've thought about it well.

36
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:35,333
You saved this research.

37
00:02:35,333 --> 00:02:37,733
It's not for the research but for the subject.

38
00:02:37,733 --> 00:02:41,200
The more we deny the memory, the more he'll try to recover it,

39
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:45,300
and if all the memories come back, he will become as unhappy as before.

40
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:47,500
As a doctor, I have to take responsibility.

41
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:48,833
Of course.

42
00:02:48,833 --> 00:02:52,500
Now that you've decided, you should just focus on him.

43
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,800
Even if it's a little difficult, hold on tight.

44
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,167
It's just the role of an old first love, it won't be that difficult.

45
00:02:58,167 --> 00:03:00,833
Doctor to patient, observer to the observed.

46
00:03:00,833 --> 00:03:03,067
Nothing changes.

47
00:03:03,067 --> 00:03:04,800
Let's go to the rounds.

48
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,900
Shall we?

49
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,600
She's here.

50
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:18,700
She is the first love I told you about.

51
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:21,633
Your… Your first love?

52
00:03:22,633 --> 00:03:24,367
What a fate.

53
00:03:24,367 --> 00:03:26,333
It's surprising that he met you at the hospital.

54
00:03:26,333 --> 00:03:28,333
Come here and sit down.

55
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:30,633
Sit down, sit down. Go inside and sit down.

56
00:03:30,633 --> 00:03:33,767
Oh, I see.

57
00:03:33,767 --> 00:03:36,867
So how old are you?

58
00:03:36,867 --> 00:03:40,500
That's an impolite question.

59
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:43,100
I'm sure you're happy that your son found his first love.

60
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:46,200
She grew up to be such a good and upright woman.

61
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:50,900
Dr. Kyeong, what are you doing? You should answer the question.

62
00:03:52,667 --> 00:03:54,667
I'm a psychiatrist, Kyeong Ju Yeon.

63
00:03:54,667 --> 00:03:56,667
I'm the same age as him and I'm single.

64
00:03:56,667 --> 00:03:58,900
I live with my mother and nephew.

65
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:01,900
My son didn't talk about girls at all,

66
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:03,533
so I was a little suspicious of his tastes.

67
00:04:03,533 --> 00:04:07,833
Honey, you know that. Right? In his suit case, a bra and panties…

68
00:04:07,833 --> 00:04:10,100
Why are you suddenly saying that?

69
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:13,667
By the way, how did you two meet?

70
00:04:13,667 --> 00:04:16,467
Well, that's…

71
00:04:16,467 --> 00:04:19,767
When we were young, it was when we were kids.

72
00:04:19,767 --> 00:04:20,900
When we were 13.

73
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:24,333
Yeah, right. We were 13.

74
00:04:24,333 --> 00:04:28,367
We were so young that we didn't know anything.

75
00:04:28,367 --> 00:04:31,533
When you were 13, it was the time our Kun played tennis.

76
00:04:31,533 --> 00:04:34,300
When and where did you meet?

77
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:44,700
Isn't the way she drinks her drink absolutely adorable?

78
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,767
Thank you for your interest,

79
00:04:47,767 --> 00:04:50,300
but our relationship is not that special.

80
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:53,967
It's just something that everyone goes through, and first love is something like that,

81
00:04:53,967 --> 00:04:56,433
so it's okay if you don't treat me this well…

82
00:04:56,433 --> 00:04:59,367
You are more than qualified.

83
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,867
She was my lifesaver when I was drowning alone...

84
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:07,633
in the countryside.

85
00:05:07,633 --> 00:05:09,667
- What? 
 - Oh my.

86
00:05:09,667 --> 00:05:13,233
Your life… lifesaver?

87
00:05:13,233 --> 00:05:14,567
Your lifesaver?

88
00:05:14,567 --> 00:05:18,467
Then she is our family's lifesaver. Right?

89
00:05:18,467 --> 00:05:22,433
We'll treat you well for the rest of our lives, and never make things difficult for you.

90
00:05:22,433 --> 00:05:25,433
Oh my, this precious person…

91
00:05:25,433 --> 00:05:27,100
- Oh. 
 - Oh my.

92
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:28,900
How precious she is.

93
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:30,400
It's a good thing he got hurt.

94
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,267
 That's when I knew 

95
00:05:32,267 --> 00:05:36,200
 the role of first love will never be smooth sailing… 

96
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:40,900
It drives me crazy. This is not just a first love.

97
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:44,400
I feel like a total fraud.

98
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,700
I have to make it clear to him.

99
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:54,300
Why isn't he coming?

100
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:57,000
What is it?

101
00:06:13,633 --> 00:06:15,133
Don't do that.

102
00:06:15,133 --> 00:06:19,200
Don't propose or do anything like that.

103
00:06:19,967 --> 00:06:23,733
 I have to stop here completely. 

104
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:28,833
♫  Look at me, look at me, look at me  ♫

105
00:06:28,833 --> 00:06:33,290
Don't blow the flowers. Please don't do anything.

106
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:37,080
♫  Can you please come to me?  ♫

107
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:42,160
♫  So high 
 Look at me, look at me, look at you  ♫

108
00:06:42,167 --> 00:06:44,967
I have a boyfriend.

109
00:06:46,667 --> 00:06:49,433
I have a boyfriend.

110
00:06:49,867 --> 00:06:54,067
I'm telling you this in advance in case you confess to me or propose to me.

111
00:06:54,067 --> 00:06:56,800
Nothing will change just because I'm your first love.

112
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,867
I will keep the good memories as good memories

113
00:06:59,867 --> 00:07:02,900
and become a doctor who prays for the speedy recovery of patients in the future.

114
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:04,500
That's a lie.

115
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,433
A lie? What do you mean by that?

116
00:07:06,433 --> 00:07:10,467
It looks like you don't have a boyfriend.

117
00:07:11,867 --> 00:07:14,333
What? Why? What's with me?

118
00:07:14,333 --> 00:07:16,667
You are cute and lovely.

119
00:07:16,667 --> 00:07:20,167
So I want to carry you in my pocket.

120
00:07:20,167 --> 00:07:25,133
When I was in the hospital, you watched me all day and night without going home.

121
00:07:25,133 --> 00:07:26,567
Even now, you only think about work.

122
00:07:26,567 --> 00:07:30,667
It seemed like you didn't have any personal time at all.

123
00:07:31,333 --> 00:07:34,800
Because I'm a workaholic.

124
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,000
The nurses said

125
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,233
you've never had a boyfriend before.

126
00:07:39,233 --> 00:07:41,500
Who said that!

127
00:07:42,667 --> 00:07:44,567
We've only been dating for a while

128
00:07:44,567 --> 00:07:47,533
and we're in a secret relationship, so no one knows.

129
00:07:47,533 --> 00:07:49,500
You've been working at the hospital 24 hours a day,

130
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:52,033
but I've never seen you go on a date.

131
00:07:52,033 --> 00:07:53,667
Well,

132
00:07:53,667 --> 00:07:57,233
my boyfriend works at this hospital.

133
00:07:57,233 --> 00:07:58,833
At the hospital…

134
00:07:58,833 --> 00:08:00,967
Who… is it?

135
00:08:00,967 --> 00:08:03,000
Ju Yeon.

136
00:08:14,667 --> 00:08:15,933
You found your first love?

137
00:08:15,933 --> 00:08:17,233
Yeah.

138
00:08:17,233 --> 00:08:19,433
Yeah, I found my first love.

139
00:08:19,433 --> 00:08:21,100
Her boyfriend, too.

140
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:24,867
Your first love's boyfriend is…

141
00:08:24,867 --> 00:08:26,000
My doctor.

142
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,133
Your doctor?

143
00:08:27,133 --> 00:08:28,633
What? Has his doctor changed?

144
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:33,067
Have I ever told you about my first love?

145
00:08:33,067 --> 00:08:35,867
Oh, well.

146
00:08:35,867 --> 00:08:40,000
She's the girl who saved your life, that's all.

147
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,633
I'm against the idea

148
00:08:41,633 --> 00:08:45,867
of things going well with your first love.

149
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:48,067
Why?

150
00:08:48,067 --> 00:08:51,067
I just have a feeling.

151
00:08:51,067 --> 00:08:55,867
I have a feeling she's going to meet all kinds of guys.

152
00:08:55,867 --> 00:08:59,000
I don't really feel...

153
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,400
that way…

154
00:09:02,867 --> 00:09:06,033
I'm sure my first love's boyfriend is that ugly guy.

155
00:09:06,033 --> 00:09:08,500
You're not jealous or something, right?

156
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:09,800
Jealous…

157
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:12,700
I'm not being jealous. Don't you know what kind of person I am?

158
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:18,467
There is no way I would be jealous of an ugly person. And I don't care about her boyfriend.

159
00:09:19,233 --> 00:09:21,333
Where…

160
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:25,533
How could he…

161
00:09:25,533 --> 00:09:27,300
Kun, it's dangerous to do that.

162
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:29,133
Where did he go?

163
00:09:29,133 --> 00:09:30,033
Where'd he go?!

164
00:09:30,033 --> 00:09:34,767
   

165
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:40,200
You didn't have to come all the way here.

166
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:43,033
Nice to meet you.

167
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:47,100
That day, there were a lot of people watching me and

168
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:50,133
I was a little embarrassed when you suddenly came to see me.

169
00:09:50,133 --> 00:09:52,567
As you can see…

170
00:09:52,567 --> 00:09:54,267
Just a moment.

171
00:09:54,267 --> 00:09:56,100
Oh my.

172
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:58,333
Go away!

173
00:09:58,333 --> 00:10:01,233
You are so famous, so…

174
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:05,333
I have a question to ask you about the accident.

175
00:10:05,333 --> 00:10:07,367
The one who fell into the water was your older brother. Right?

176
00:10:07,367 --> 00:10:08,600
Yes.

177
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:13,600
He can't remember due to the aftermath of the accident, so you can ask me.

178
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:17,967
You reported him to 911 that day as a suicide attempt.

179
00:10:17,967 --> 00:10:20,733
You were at the scene of the incident that day. Right?

180
00:10:22,367 --> 00:10:24,200
Actually…

181
00:10:25,567 --> 00:10:27,433
 You… 

182
00:10:28,433 --> 00:10:30,933
 How can you talk to your mom like that? 

183
00:10:30,933 --> 00:10:32,633
 Mom? 

184
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:40,233
 You've never been "Lee Kun's mom". 

185
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,533
 I'll go after him. 

186
00:10:57,100 --> 00:11:00,900
That day, my brother ran out after a small argument with my parents,

187
00:11:05,467 --> 00:11:07,700
so I followed him and thought,

188
00:11:13,667 --> 00:11:16,833
it would be better to give him some time to think on his own.

189
00:11:31,533 --> 00:11:37,100
When I turned around, my brother had already fallen into the water.

190
00:11:42,167 --> 00:11:47,733
I immediately ran down the bridge and called 911.

191
00:11:50,067 --> 00:11:52,433
According to the paramedic log,

192
00:11:52,433 --> 00:11:57,367
he was already saved just before the paramedics arrived.

193
00:11:57,367 --> 00:12:01,300
After I rescued him, the paramedics arrived and

194
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:06,400
he underwent CPR and had surgery for a traumatic brain hemorrhage.

195
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:10,933
Even if he is your older brother, it's not easy to do that,

196
00:12:10,933 --> 00:12:12,733
but you did a great job.

197
00:12:12,733 --> 00:12:15,080
Oh, yes.

198
00:12:15,767 --> 00:12:20,267
But is that possible because you are an athlete?

199
00:12:20,267 --> 00:12:25,433
It would be impossible to save someone who fell from a bridge in that short amount of time.

200
00:12:38,233 --> 00:12:42,067
Hello, I'm the president of player Lee Shin's agency.

201
00:12:42,067 --> 00:12:44,450
I came today as a lawyer.

202
00:12:45,233 --> 00:12:46,667
Oh, yes.

203
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:55,067
We don't plan on making this matter public.

204
00:12:56,733 --> 00:13:01,300
Shin doesn't want his family to be embarrassed because of his fame.

205
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:04,933
I'd like to ask you to take care to prevent this incident from being leaked to the outside.

206
00:13:04,933 --> 00:13:08,667
Oh, and you know that our Shin will be representing the country next month. Right?

207
00:13:08,667 --> 00:13:13,133
If the game is ruined due to psychological discomfort caused by this incident,

208
00:13:13,133 --> 00:13:17,067
wouldn't the police officers become traitors to the nation?

209
00:13:17,067 --> 00:13:19,933
Don't make a fuss, you know?

210
00:13:26,833 --> 00:13:32,167
You're not using this incident as an excuse to renew my contract. Right?

211
00:13:32,933 --> 00:13:34,733
Who do you think I am?

212
00:13:34,733 --> 00:13:38,767
Renewing the contract is your choice.

213
00:13:40,233 --> 00:13:41,833
However,

214
00:13:41,833 --> 00:13:46,500
rumors tend to spread from the closest people.

215
00:13:48,533 --> 00:13:53,333
Let's go. Since you have to manage your diet, eat uncooked tofu.

216
00:14:21,233 --> 00:14:25,567
 The side effects of surgery are a secret between you and me. 

217
00:14:26,467 --> 00:14:27,800
 Don't tell it to Te Oh, either. 

218
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:30,833
 Senior Te Oh is on the same team, how could I… 

219
00:14:30,833 --> 00:14:33,500
 Only until the cause is found. 

220
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:38,067
 Don't trust anyone, and don't tell anyone! 

221
00:14:38,067 --> 00:14:42,733
 Yeah! If something goes wrong, I can't make Senior Te Oh take responsibility too. 

222
00:14:42,733 --> 00:14:47,367
Wait, that will help us with our tracking experiments. Right?

223
00:14:47,367 --> 00:14:50,800
Even now, we're having a hard time because of unpredictable subjects.

224
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,400
However, the doctor is the subject's first love?

225
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:55,033
Wouldn't he be cooperative?

226
00:14:55,033 --> 00:14:56,867
That's good.

227
00:14:56,867 --> 00:14:59,333
Oh, Kyeong Ju Yeon. You are capable.

228
00:14:59,333 --> 00:15:01,400
This is a chance, a chance.

229
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,733
Yeah.

230
00:15:06,533 --> 00:15:08,767
Oh? You're using the keyring well.

231
00:15:08,767 --> 00:15:11,600
You know I chose this with great care. Right?

232
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:14,233
I always carry this with me.

233
00:15:14,233 --> 00:15:17,133
Because it was my first birthday present from you.

234
00:15:20,933 --> 00:15:23,367
Even though this looks cheap,

235
00:15:23,367 --> 00:15:27,467
I chose it with you in mind whileI was busy with the Paris conference.

236
00:15:30,033 --> 00:15:31,767
Ah, the smell of metal.

237
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,800
I can't smell anything.

238
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:39,633
I wear this all the time too. I have a metal allergy.

239
00:15:39,633 --> 00:15:40,967
It's gold!

240
00:15:40,967 --> 00:15:43,533
- Couple items. 
 - Couple items.

241
00:15:43,533 --> 00:15:45,933
The Eiffel Tower is really pretty.

242
00:15:45,933 --> 00:15:47,700
Oh, are you all right?

243
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:49,567
Who did that!

244
00:15:54,867 --> 00:15:56,500
Oh my.

245
00:16:05,190 --> 00:16:06,150
 ­  

246
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:07,050
 ­  

247
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:07,950
 ­  

248
00:16:07,950 --> 00:16:09,180
 ­  

249
00:16:19,433 --> 00:16:21,933
What is this?

250
00:16:21,933 --> 00:16:26,067
Isn't this the shrimp toast that Chef Lee Yeon Bok personally made?

251
00:16:26,067 --> 00:16:30,500
They say the shrimp melts in your mouth. Right?

252
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:34,400
Isn't this the pork cutlet that Chef Paik Jong Won recommended?

253
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:37,700
I heard it came by plane from Jeju Island.

254
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:39,433
It came by plane from Jeju Island.

255
00:16:39,433 --> 00:16:43,767
Hey… Hey! You…

256
00:16:43,767 --> 00:16:46,700
Are you melting?

257
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:49,867
Mango shaved ice made with Hawaiian apple mango.

258
00:16:49,867 --> 00:16:51,500
This is such a shame.

259
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:53,133
People should go on a date at a restaurant like this.

260
00:16:53,133 --> 00:16:57,967
Not in a hospital cafeteria that smells like disinfectant.

261
00:16:59,267 --> 00:17:02,867
Senior, let's eat deliciously too…

262
00:17:06,533 --> 00:17:08,033
Would you like me to have a bite?

263
00:17:08,033 --> 00:17:10,667
What should I eat first?

264
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:18,067
It's melting, it's melting.

265
00:17:18,067 --> 00:17:19,833
Lee Kun, how are you feeling?

266
00:17:19,833 --> 00:17:21,667
I'm feeling bad.

267
00:17:21,667 --> 00:17:23,933
It'll get better soon.

268
00:17:29,067 --> 00:17:31,900
This is a delicious restaurant.

269
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:35,800
Ju Yeon, you should come and eat some. It's a waste if there's food left over.

270
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:39,367
I'll go first.

271
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:50,700
What are you doing?

272
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:57,867
Are you… okay?

273
00:17:59,067 --> 00:18:00,767
- With this… 
 - I can just go to the bathroom and clean it.

274
00:18:00,767 --> 00:18:03,333
But, it's…

275
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:05,533
Oh, it's an emergency patient.

276
00:18:05,533 --> 00:18:07,333
I haven't eaten it all.

277
00:18:07,333 --> 00:18:11,033
Ju Yeon, buy me coffee later.

278
00:18:11,033 --> 00:18:13,200
Yes.

279
00:18:16,133 --> 00:18:18,033
You look sad.

280
00:18:18,033 --> 00:18:21,300
Why can't you say anything to that guy

281
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:24,400
when you're so mean to me?

282
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:27,633
Then please stop acting like that.

283
00:18:27,633 --> 00:18:29,433
Because I already have someone I like.

284
00:18:29,433 --> 00:18:31,167
Does the goal not go in just because there's a goalkeeper?

285
00:18:31,167 --> 00:18:32,700
Yes, the goal won't be scored.

286
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:34,567
Even if a goal is scored, the goalkeeper doesn't change.

287
00:18:34,567 --> 00:18:36,700
- Even if I score 10 goals? 
 - Yes. Even if you score 10 goals.

288
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:38,267
If I score 10 goals, the coach will change.

289
00:18:38,267 --> 00:18:40,333
The new coach is planning to change the goalkeeper.

290
00:18:40,333 --> 00:18:41,633
Won't change.

291
00:18:41,633 --> 00:18:42,733
I'm an impregnable woman.

292
00:18:42,733 --> 00:18:45,500
I'm a straightforward guy.

293
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,200
   

294
00:18:53,067 --> 00:18:56,067
I'm on a date with Senior for the first time in a while, but why is he here, seriously?

295
00:18:56,067 --> 00:18:58,633
We don't get along well.

296
00:18:58,633 --> 00:19:01,367
Well, it was like that from the beginning.

297
00:19:01,367 --> 00:19:04,733
It's hard to pretend to be his first love when it started off as a bad relationship,

298
00:19:04,733 --> 00:19:07,700
but I also have to act like a lifesaver.

299
00:19:10,633 --> 00:19:12,567
However,

300
00:19:12,567 --> 00:19:16,267
he fell into water when he was little?

301
00:19:16,267 --> 00:19:19,400
Then he must have had trauma from falling into water.

302
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:23,100
Why did he jump into the water again?

303
00:19:34,633 --> 00:19:35,633
Okay, nice.

304
00:19:35,633 --> 00:19:37,333
One.

305
00:19:37,333 --> 00:19:39,600
A little faster.

306
00:19:40,167 --> 00:19:41,767
- Faster. 
 - Shin.

307
00:19:41,767 --> 00:19:44,467
You have to swing all the way through.

308
00:19:44,467 --> 00:19:47,533
Shin, you have to move your feet.

309
00:19:47,533 --> 00:19:49,733
Bend your knees further.

310
00:19:49,733 --> 00:19:52,433
Bend your knees further! One, two!

311
00:19:52,433 --> 00:19:54,800
Oh, Honey. Shh!

312
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:58,467
- Oh my. 
 - He's doing his best.

313
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:04,300
Shall we take a 10-minute break?

314
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:06,367
Yes.

315
00:20:07,033 --> 00:20:08,133
You came?

316
00:20:08,133 --> 00:20:09,533
Oh, President.

317
00:20:09,533 --> 00:20:11,567
Yes.

318
00:20:13,333 --> 00:20:17,233
Did you go to the police station with him?

319
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:22,567
Honey, relax. Leave it to me.

320
00:20:23,567 --> 00:20:24,600
Listen to me.

321
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:29,533
His schedule is full of competitions starting tomorrow. Why today...

322
00:20:29,533 --> 00:20:32,900
I've had a good conversation with the police officers.

323
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:35,633
I've made sure they won't say anything later either.

324
00:20:35,633 --> 00:20:37,833
You should have called us before having him give testimony.

325
00:20:37,833 --> 00:20:39,800
Oh, I really don't like it.

326
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:43,133
Honey, relax. Leave it to me.

327
00:20:43,133 --> 00:20:45,367
President.

328
00:20:45,367 --> 00:20:47,267
You can't just leave while we are talking.

329
00:20:47,267 --> 00:20:49,500
Next time, tell me in advance…

330
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:52,667
What are you doing? Signing a ball?

331
00:20:54,067 --> 00:20:55,900
Did you just make him do this?

332
00:20:55,900 --> 00:21:00,767
No, Shin asked for these new balls.

333
00:21:00,767 --> 00:21:02,933
Guk Bong is an after-school teacher.

334
00:21:02,933 --> 00:21:05,500
It's a day when I go to Guk Bong's work and mentor him for a day.

335
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:07,400
For those kids who want to be tennis players…

336
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,100
What?

337
00:21:11,133 --> 00:21:14,133
Did you know this?

338
00:21:14,133 --> 00:21:16,300
What?

339
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:19,633
Honey, you know the donation of talent. Right?

340
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:25,633
What are you talking about?

341
00:21:25,633 --> 00:21:27,700
You know he has a match tomorrow. Right?

342
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:30,567
Why do you make his schedule like this?

343
00:21:30,567 --> 00:21:33,433
You checked his condition earlier, right?

344
00:21:33,433 --> 00:21:35,600
It's a good thing, though…

345
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,600
Put off that schedule until later.

346
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,033
See.

347
00:21:39,033 --> 00:21:41,567
You have to do the PT you missed today in the remaining time.

348
00:21:41,567 --> 00:21:44,133
Since there is a game tomorrow, he has a tight schedule today,

349
00:21:44,133 --> 00:21:47,767
including going to the hospital, mental coaching, and sports massage.

350
00:21:47,767 --> 00:21:51,800
Hello, yes.

351
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:55,200
Yes, yes. Thank you.

352
00:21:56,533 --> 00:21:59,467
Honey!

353
00:22:01,233 --> 00:22:05,433
You guys treat me rudely at home. I asked you to save some face in front of others.

354
00:22:05,433 --> 00:22:07,567
And your hands, your hands!

355
00:22:07,567 --> 00:22:10,067
Did you forget that you used to be a volleyball player?

356
00:22:10,067 --> 00:22:12,467
With that hand like Thor's hammer.

357
00:22:12,467 --> 00:22:15,100
That's kind of attempted murder.

358
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:16,833
And all day long,

359
00:22:16,833 --> 00:22:21,333
I make sacrifices like this to make Shin the best player.

360
00:22:26,033 --> 00:22:27,633
Salute!

361
00:22:27,633 --> 00:22:31,367
I'll go after all my schedules if I have some time left, Mother.

362
00:22:31,367 --> 00:22:34,900
Don't worry.

363
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:36,267
Don't be mad.

364
00:22:36,267 --> 00:22:39,467
Yeah, my son.

365
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,733
- Honey. 
 - Dad.

366
00:22:44,733 --> 00:22:47,000
- Don't be mad, Dad. 
 - Oh, go to your mom.

367
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,967
Honey, I'm sorry for hitting you.

368
00:22:49,967 --> 00:22:51,833
Calm yourself down.

369
00:22:52,667 --> 00:22:56,633
I was fooled back then, so I just said I wouldn't drink.

370
00:22:56,633 --> 00:23:00,133
You told me to just trust you.

371
00:23:00,133 --> 00:23:03,133
Why did you drink alcohol back then?

372
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,340
Seok.

373
00:23:07,067 --> 00:23:09,400
Come here.

374
00:23:11,033 --> 00:23:12,967
Seok.

375
00:23:20,067 --> 00:23:22,810
It really hurt, Noona.

376
00:23:22,810 --> 00:23:25,100
 ­You're okay. 

377
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,467
Let's do well.

378
00:23:27,467 --> 00:23:29,333
Coach, let's get started right away.

379
00:23:29,333 --> 00:23:31,000
Guys.

380
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,867
I've known

381
00:23:32,867 --> 00:23:37,833
Shin since he was young.

382
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:40,733
I'm an after-school teacher now,

383
00:23:40,733 --> 00:23:44,667
but when I was younger, I was a very promising athlete.

384
00:23:46,267 --> 00:23:48,800
Would you like to get an autograph from the player Lee Shin later?

385
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:50,967
 - Me. 
 - Me. 

386
00:23:50,967 --> 00:23:52,367
Oh, guys.

387
00:23:52,367 --> 00:23:56,100
Since I'm in a good mood, I'll buy you some pizza later.

388
00:24:12,890 --> 00:24:14,290
  ­ 

389
00:24:30,667 --> 00:24:32,433
Thank you.

390
00:24:43,633 --> 00:24:45,267
All right, guys.

391
00:24:45,267 --> 00:24:48,767
I am here.

392
00:24:50,167 --> 00:24:53,833
I heard that this is where I worked.

393
00:24:58,967 --> 00:25:01,033
Yeah, good. Over there.

394
00:25:01,033 --> 00:25:03,533
This way, too.

395
00:25:03,533 --> 00:25:05,633
That's very nice.

396
00:25:08,433 --> 00:25:10,267
Who is this?

397
00:25:10,267 --> 00:25:14,833
I thought you quit work because you were absent without notice.

398
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:19,600
Oh my.

399
00:25:22,567 --> 00:25:24,867
Yes, please feel free to eat.

400
00:25:24,867 --> 00:25:27,000
It's okay.

401
00:25:31,333 --> 00:25:33,967
I'll tell you straightly.

402
00:25:33,967 --> 00:25:37,033
Shin said you were sick.

403
00:25:37,033 --> 00:25:39,400
Did you hurt your head?

404
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:46,167
To be blunt, I ask you to take good care of me in the future.

405
00:25:46,167 --> 00:25:51,167
Even though I lost my memory, I don't think I lost my excellent analytical skills.

406
00:25:51,167 --> 00:25:56,167
I'm willing to donate my talent to this company.

407
00:25:59,367 --> 00:26:04,100
He saved you, but it looks like you hurt your head.

408
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:05,900
Is this why he told me not to publish the article?

409
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:07,400
   

410
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:10,433
Oh, Cha Si On. Youngster.

411
00:26:10,433 --> 00:26:12,467
Okay, then.

412
00:26:12,467 --> 00:26:15,667
Take care of your agency, and I'll leave.

413
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:22,233
Okay, let's see what you can do.

414
00:26:22,233 --> 00:26:25,467
If you win Cha Si On's contract,

415
00:26:25,467 --> 00:26:28,267
I'll guarantee your employment for life. How about that?

416
00:26:32,133 --> 00:26:36,067
For some reason, I hate him. I don't want to see him.

417
00:26:37,167 --> 00:26:40,400
Who saves whom?

418
00:26:42,933 --> 00:26:46,733
They clearly said I fell down the stairs.

419
00:26:48,567 --> 00:26:51,767
Anyway, I don't like him.

420
00:27:06,733 --> 00:27:08,833
No way, again?

421
00:27:08,833 --> 00:27:11,267
Oh, Lee Kun!

422
00:27:12,767 --> 00:27:14,800
What is it?

423
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:20,433
Have you finished filling out the test paper?

424
00:27:20,433 --> 00:27:22,933
Looks like I'm in trouble for being sleepy.

425
00:27:30,733 --> 00:27:31,767
Yes, take some rest.

426
00:27:31,767 --> 00:27:35,833
I'll take you there. Let's go.

427
00:27:39,367 --> 00:27:40,967
Yes.

428
00:27:47,467 --> 00:27:51,367
Why are you being so kind today?

429
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:56,667
Does Dr. Te Oh have a girlfriend?

430
00:27:56,667 --> 00:27:58,620
I don't know.

431
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:01,667
Why? Are you interested in him?

432
00:28:01,667 --> 00:28:05,300
Yes, I'm interested in him, but I don't want to be interested in him.

433
00:28:06,633 --> 00:28:09,533
Stop, stop!

434
00:28:09,533 --> 00:28:12,467
What is that Eiffel Tower thing?

435
00:28:15,067 --> 00:28:16,640
This one?

436
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:19,900
This is what Dr. Te Oh bought us when he came back from

437
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:21,900
a business trip to Paris last year.

438
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:23,733
He didn't give it to me right away,

439
00:28:23,733 --> 00:28:29,433
but he gave it to me on my birthday, saying, "I'm giving it to you only."

440
00:28:30,267 --> 00:28:32,133
He gave it to everyone?

441
00:28:32,133 --> 00:28:35,133
All of our lab members received it,

442
00:28:35,133 --> 00:28:38,233
and there were some patients who received them from him, too.

443
00:28:38,233 --> 00:28:41,233
That's something like 20 for 10 dollars.

444
00:28:41,233 --> 00:28:45,000
Dr. Te Oh was originally a bit stingy.

445
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:49,133
He probably wouldn't spend a penny even if he got a girlfriend.

446
00:28:49,133 --> 00:28:51,867
That's what it was.

447
00:28:51,867 --> 00:28:54,800
Lee Kun, how are you feeling?

448
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:59,100
Not good.

449
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:03,333
Achoo, cheapskate.

450
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,700
Oh, cheapskate.

451
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:07,100
Dr. Kim?

452
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:11,433
 Yeah, we need to get some advice 

453
00:29:11,433 --> 00:29:13,500
on how to reverse the side effects.

454
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:17,133
If we consult with our neurosurgery department, it's obvious the director will find out about it.

455
00:29:17,133 --> 00:29:20,733
When it comes to brain science, no one can match Dr. Kim.

456
00:29:20,733 --> 00:29:22,767
 I can trust Dr. Kim. 

457
00:29:22,767 --> 00:29:26,700
I hope it gets resolved quickly so I can focus on my thesis.

458
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:30,100
Professor, please don't worry about patients with reservations.

459
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:32,000
Yes.

460
00:29:33,867 --> 00:29:38,133
Once the side effects are resolved, the troublesome role of first love will end.

461
00:29:38,133 --> 00:29:42,800
From now on, there will only be good days with Senior Te Oh. Right?

462
00:29:46,833 --> 00:29:49,667
Why is that car moving like that in the hospital?

463
00:30:11,910 --> 00:30:14,300
Oh no!­

464
00:30:19,667 --> 00:30:22,133
Hey, don't you know this is a hospital?

465
00:30:22,133 --> 00:30:25,000
It's dangerous.

466
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,967
First, the accident-inducing ball game.

467
00:30:26,967 --> 00:30:30,867
Second, violating the vehicle speed limit. Third, even running at full speed.

468
00:30:30,867 --> 00:30:33,867
Okay. Throw me the ball, quickly, quickly.

469
00:30:33,867 --> 00:30:36,100
Pass, pass, pass.

470
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:45,933
Oh, the balls.

471
00:30:45,933 --> 00:30:49,033
Please pick up the balls. Those are important balls.

472
00:30:50,567 --> 00:30:52,700
Wait.

473
00:30:57,533 --> 00:30:59,733
Stay there, freeze!

474
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:06,233
It's a ball.

475
00:31:06,767 --> 00:31:09,733
Oh, that was close.

476
00:31:09,733 --> 00:31:11,667
Oh, Dr. Kyeong.

477
00:31:11,667 --> 00:31:15,367
What are you doing here? Do you need help?

478
00:31:15,367 --> 00:31:19,233
It's okay. It's part of the treatment process.

479
00:31:19,233 --> 00:31:20,567
See you at your next appointment.

480
00:31:20,567 --> 00:31:23,567
Oh, please continue with the treatment.

481
00:31:23,567 --> 00:31:26,670
Then, I'll go.

482
00:31:26,670 --> 00:31:27,460
 ­  

483
00:31:35,033 --> 00:31:38,633
Don't look at me. Please just pass by.

484
00:31:38,633 --> 00:31:39,967
Dr. Kyeong?

485
00:31:39,967 --> 00:31:41,633
Dr. Kyeong?

486
00:31:41,633 --> 00:31:45,733
What are you doing here?

487
00:31:45,733 --> 00:31:47,400
I'm stretching.

488
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:49,333
Here?

489
00:31:49,333 --> 00:31:52,433
Professor Han is out of the office today, so you have to see all the patients

490
00:31:52,433 --> 00:31:54,167
who have appointments.

491
00:31:54,167 --> 00:31:57,333
When you're done stretching, please stand up.

492
00:31:57,333 --> 00:31:59,133
Ju Yeon, are you okay?

493
00:31:59,133 --> 00:32:01,233
- Oh my. 
 - Oh.

494
00:32:01,233 --> 00:32:02,267
Why are you doing this on the street?

495
00:32:02,267 --> 00:32:04,767
Oh, here…

496
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:08,167
Quickly sort it out…

497
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:21,433
Are you keeping a good eye on Lee Kun?

498
00:32:21,433 --> 00:32:22,467
Yes.

499
00:32:22,467 --> 00:32:24,567
Did you check the condition of the mouse 109?

500
00:32:24,567 --> 00:32:26,667
Yes, sure.

501
00:32:28,067 --> 00:32:30,333
I'll go to the office.

502
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:35,200
   

503
00:32:35,867 --> 00:32:38,167
I'll go.

504
00:32:38,167 --> 00:32:40,667
You guys, take care.

505
00:32:41,267 --> 00:32:44,900
Please answer the phone.

506
00:32:45,967 --> 00:32:48,067
Oh my.

507
00:32:48,067 --> 00:32:50,667
Sir, when will Senior come?

508
00:32:50,667 --> 00:32:52,567
Right.

509
00:32:52,567 --> 00:32:55,167
Yes, Shin.

510
00:32:55,167 --> 00:32:58,000
Are you coming here?

511
00:32:58,633 --> 00:33:03,767
30 minutes? Yes, okay.

512
00:33:04,833 --> 00:33:06,067
Guys.

513
00:33:06,067 --> 00:33:07,967
Player Lee Shin is coming here.

514
00:33:07,967 --> 00:33:10,200
- Yes. 
 - Really?

515
00:33:23,033 --> 00:33:25,067
The balls.

516
00:33:34,767 --> 00:33:38,933
I've never seen a woman lay down for me.

517
00:33:38,933 --> 00:33:40,233
I have nothing to give you.

518
00:33:40,233 --> 00:33:43,000
I don't want your autographed ball.

519
00:33:46,833 --> 00:33:49,167
To relieve your fatigue…

520
00:33:49,833 --> 00:33:51,067
That's fine.

521
00:33:51,067 --> 00:33:54,433
I've already developed a tolerance to tonics, so they don't even relieve my fatigue.

522
00:33:54,433 --> 00:33:55,867
No.

523
00:33:55,867 --> 00:34:00,200
Look at my face here and relieve your fatigue.

524
00:34:01,767 --> 00:34:06,067
I have a consultation, goodbye.

525
00:34:06,067 --> 00:34:08,333
Well,

526
00:34:08,333 --> 00:34:11,567
I am that patient today.

527
00:34:11,567 --> 00:34:15,467
Oh, Professor Han went on a business trip today.

528
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:18,430
 ­  

529
00:34:18,433 --> 00:34:19,700
Doctor,

530
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:22,867
can I leave early today?

531
00:34:22,867 --> 00:34:26,467
Do you think this is school?

532
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:30,000
I really need to go to school.

533
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,933
Please keep it a secret from my mom and coach,

534
00:34:31,933 --> 00:34:35,200
and just give me a prescription please.

535
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:37,567
I'm a doctor, not a mind reader.

536
00:34:37,567 --> 00:34:41,000
There is no prescription without treatment.

537
00:34:44,590 --> 00:34:45,510
 ­  

538
00:34:47,567 --> 00:34:51,400
I really don't have time today because I have something to do.

539
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:53,433
I really need the medicine because there is a competition tomorrow.

540
00:34:53,433 --> 00:34:56,467
Then, shall we begin the consultation?

541
00:34:56,467 --> 00:34:58,980
Oh, just a moment.

542
00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:00,570
 ­  

543
00:35:02,467 --> 00:35:04,033
This is it, right?

544
00:35:04,033 --> 00:35:06,033
That… That dog that drools when someone rings the bell?

545
00:35:06,033 --> 00:35:08,000
Whose dog was it?

546
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,667
It's Pavlov's dog.

547
00:35:09,667 --> 00:35:11,967
That's right. I'm not even his dog.

548
00:35:11,967 --> 00:35:14,333
If you do this, you think I'll organize it again. Right?

549
00:35:14,333 --> 00:35:16,633
Oh boy.

550
00:35:19,470 --> 00:35:21,367
 ­  

551
00:35:21,367 --> 00:35:23,067
I do, I do.

552
00:35:23,067 --> 00:35:24,767
I do it, but…

553
00:35:24,767 --> 00:35:27,900
That's kind of a jinx for sports people.

554
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:29,967
I don't have any particular emotional problems.

555
00:35:29,967 --> 00:35:31,633
So, there is no need for consultation.

556
00:35:31,633 --> 00:35:36,200
Isn't this OCD, obsessive-compulsive disorder, disguised as a jinx?

557
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:40,600
This happens a lot to athletes who have to live up to expectations.

558
00:35:41,267 --> 00:35:43,433
I have to live up to expectations.

559
00:35:43,433 --> 00:35:47,900
The expectations of sponsors who support me. The expectations of staff who support me.

560
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:51,467
The expectations of the people who support me.

561
00:35:51,467 --> 00:35:57,233
To live up to the expectations of my parents who support me.

562
00:35:59,133 --> 00:36:01,667
What about you?

563
00:36:03,133 --> 00:36:05,900
You think about sponsors, parents, and staff,

564
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:08,500
but why don't you think about yourself?

565
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:10,600
Me?

566
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:12,600
Do my thoughts matter?

567
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:14,433
Then, whose thoughts matter?

568
00:36:14,433 --> 00:36:16,933
It's your life.

569
00:36:21,133 --> 00:36:25,100
Anyway, I don't have any compulsion or anything.

570
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:26,233
I'll go.

571
00:36:26,233 --> 00:36:29,300
Yes, goodbye.

572
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:55,600
   

573
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:04,600
­Oh?

574
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:10,367
Soju and beer?

575
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,333
Beef.

576
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:15,400
That's good!

577
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:17,533
- Good. 
 - Good.

578
00:37:17,533 --> 00:37:21,667
He has a girlfriend, but there's too much skinship.

579
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:30,633
By the way, everyone is leaving work, but is she working alone again?

580
00:37:33,933 --> 00:37:37,500
I fell down the stairs and there was no trauma.

581
00:37:38,867 --> 00:37:41,733
I don't have any trauma,

582
00:37:41,733 --> 00:37:44,500
but I need psychiatric counseling.

583
00:38:09,433 --> 00:38:12,500
Meeting room.

584
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:16,833
   

585
00:38:52,567 --> 00:38:56,967
Do you do all the work at this hospital by yourself?

586
00:38:58,167 --> 00:39:01,800
What are you going to do if you collapse?

587
00:39:05,390 --> 00:39:14,130
 ♫ Being together with the worries that cling to me ♫ 

588
00:39:14,130 --> 00:39:16,933
Your face is really small.

589
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:26,590
You look so pretty that I want to protect you.

590
00:39:30,550 --> 00:39:36,100
♫  The only thing that shines through these repeating days  ♫

591
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:37,200
No.

592
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:40,567
Oh my.

593
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,100
Why are...

594
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:46,300
your lips so pretty?

595
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:49,467
You make my heart flutter for no reason.

596
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:55,000
It's cold.

597
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,633
What?

598
00:39:56,633 --> 00:40:00,667
Why are you feeling cold? It makes me want to hug you.

599
00:40:01,333 --> 00:40:03,967
Do I have to hug you?

600
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:10,367
No.

601
00:40:10,367 --> 00:40:14,080
I'm crazy! No, no!

602
00:40:18,367 --> 00:40:22,000
Decay memory.

603
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,133
Erase...

604
00:40:24,133 --> 00:40:26,880
memory. What's that?

605
00:40:35,633 --> 00:40:37,900
What are you doing here?

606
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:41,033
My arm, my arm.

607
00:40:41,033 --> 00:40:42,233
What's wrong with your arm? Are you having any pain?

608
00:40:42,233 --> 00:40:44,600
I got a cramp in my arm.

609
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:46,267
A cramp.

610
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,500
I said I've got a cramp in my arm.

611
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:52,833
That's why I hit it.

612
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:56,933
Oh, it's better.

613
00:40:56,933 --> 00:41:00,533
Did you see it? How much did you see?

614
00:41:02,833 --> 00:41:05,067
Who can recognize that bad handwriting?

615
00:41:05,067 --> 00:41:07,667
Can you even recognize that?

616
00:41:10,233 --> 00:41:14,133
Why did you come here again?

617
00:41:15,433 --> 00:41:17,300
To see you.

618
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:18,933
Why are you sleeping here?

619
00:41:18,933 --> 00:41:22,133
What if someone secretly kisses you?

620
00:41:22,133 --> 00:41:25,867
Did you do something to me?

621
00:41:26,833 --> 00:41:29,200
What?

622
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:33,633
Are you expecting something?

623
00:41:33,633 --> 00:41:35,333
You're a sneaky woman.

624
00:41:35,333 --> 00:41:39,267
If you like that style, I'll give it a try.

625
00:41:42,733 --> 00:41:45,067
Okay, let's go get some snacks.

626
00:41:45,067 --> 00:41:47,233
I had dinner already.

627
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:50,700
Aren't you just trying to refuse me when you haven't eaten?

628
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:52,533
Right.

629
00:41:55,067 --> 00:41:58,667
I tried to leave it, but

630
00:41:58,667 --> 00:42:00,500
I'll use it!

631
00:42:01,333 --> 00:42:03,500
The wish coupon.

632
00:42:04,667 --> 00:42:08,567
 Then let's play rock, paper, scissors. 

633
00:42:08,567 --> 00:42:10,100
 I never lose. 

634
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:11,967
 Same goes for me. 

635
00:42:11,967 --> 00:42:14,733
 One round only. 

636
00:42:14,733 --> 00:42:18,600
 I'm a man, so I'll show rock. 

637
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:20,133
 - Scissors. 
 - Rock. 

638
00:42:20,133 --> 00:42:21,833
 Paper! 

639
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:25,367
 You said you'd show rock. 

640
00:42:25,367 --> 00:42:28,500
 You said you'd show rock because you're a man. 

641
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:32,033
 I told you, I never lose. 

642
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,367
 I'll go in there. 

643
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:43,967
 I'll go in. 

644
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:48,390
 Well, then. 

645
00:42:48,933 --> 00:42:52,500
 Will you give me a wish coupon? 

646
00:42:55,833 --> 00:42:59,400
Everything is good, but your eyesight is worse than I thought.

647
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:01,467
I only wear glasses when I read books.

648
00:43:01,467 --> 00:43:05,033
I mean you have a bad taste in men.

649
00:43:05,033 --> 00:43:06,933
Are you being petty and dissing me now?

650
00:43:06,933 --> 00:43:10,067
I can tell you for sure that guy doesn't like you.

651
00:43:10,067 --> 00:43:13,033
Either that or he's bored of you.

652
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:17,100
Do you like sweet guys?

653
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:22,200
No.

654
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:24,767
If you have to date

655
00:43:24,767 --> 00:43:28,167
another man before you meet me,

656
00:43:28,167 --> 00:43:31,000
then meet a man

657
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:35,000
who truly loves you.

658
00:43:45,233 --> 00:43:50,167
Fill your glass halfway with manners, and fill it with love.

659
00:43:51,100 --> 00:43:53,800
What do you think of guys like me?

660
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:55,967
Just tell me your hobbies and tastes.

661
00:43:55,967 --> 00:43:57,367
I'll cater to them all.

662
00:43:57,367 --> 00:43:58,833
For your information,

663
00:43:58,833 --> 00:44:02,367
my taste is Kyeong Ju Yeon.

664
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:06,067
See.

665
00:44:06,067 --> 00:44:08,533
 Where are you? Did you go home? Tell me where you are. 

666
00:44:08,533 --> 00:44:11,433
He asks me where I am and if I have eaten.

667
00:44:11,433 --> 00:44:14,667
Even though he texts me like this, he doesn't like me?

668
00:44:14,667 --> 00:44:16,667
Don't misunderstand him for no reason.

669
00:44:16,667 --> 00:44:18,633
He thinks he's a navigation?

670
00:44:18,633 --> 00:44:20,267
Why does he keep asking about your location?

671
00:44:20,267 --> 00:44:22,600
First loves don't always come true.

672
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:25,400
Don't dwell on the past

673
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:26,900
and live for today.

674
00:44:26,900 --> 00:44:29,900
Because the past is just the past.

675
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:36,467
When you feel empty,

676
00:44:36,467 --> 00:44:39,133
eating a bowl of these hot noodles

677
00:44:39,133 --> 00:44:43,100
makes you feel warm and relieved. Right?

678
00:44:43,100 --> 00:44:44,367
Your touch

679
00:44:44,367 --> 00:44:46,400
felt that way to me back then.

680
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:01,600
The hand that hugged me on the day I was shivering

681
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:04,667
in the cold water was so warm.

682
00:45:04,667 --> 00:45:09,600
The hand that calmed me down when I was startled was really reassuring.

683
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:11,467
You are the one who changed

684
00:45:11,467 --> 00:45:15,310
even the bad memories that were between life and death...

685
00:45:15,867 --> 00:45:18,100
into good memories.

686
00:45:18,100 --> 00:45:21,167
I can't even remember what happened just a few days ago,

687
00:45:21,167 --> 00:45:24,967
but my memories of you from back then are vivid.

688
00:45:26,133 --> 00:45:28,100
So to me,

689
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:31,067
you are no longer the past.

690
00:45:31,067 --> 00:45:34,233
You are in the present.

691
00:45:37,100 --> 00:45:39,800
What are you saying?

692
00:45:49,067 --> 00:45:53,900
Soon, I'm going to make...

693
00:45:53,900 --> 00:45:58,767
your eyes look like this.

694
00:46:07,567 --> 00:46:15,033
♫  The silent streets are filled  ♫

695
00:46:15,033 --> 00:46:22,567
♫  With countless thoughts and the wounds inside them  ♫

696
00:46:22,567 --> 00:46:30,100
♫  You light a small light in a corner  ♫

697
00:46:30,100 --> 00:46:36,833
♫  Of my heart that I had ignored  ♫

698
00:46:36,833 --> 00:46:44,467
♫  Where will it be, that day  ♫

699
00:46:44,467 --> 00:46:52,233
♫  How much further do I have to go before I can see  ♫

700
00:46:52,233 --> 00:46:58,733
♫  Even if that unreachable dream  ♫

701
00:46:58,733 --> 00:47:06,733
♫  Turns away from me and becomes more blurred  ♫

702
00:47:07,900 --> 00:47:13,967
♫  I will walk towards that day  ♫

703
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:29,000
Did you sleep well?

704
00:47:29,833 --> 00:47:34,100
It's been a while since I came back, so you slept next to me?

705
00:47:40,433 --> 00:47:45,500
Seung Hyun, you have to get up to go to kindergarten.

706
00:47:51,900 --> 00:47:54,667
Who are you?

707
00:47:54,667 --> 00:47:58,100
Let's sleep a little more, okay?

708
00:47:59,267 --> 00:48:00,933
Mom!

709
00:48:00,933 --> 00:48:05,133
So why didn't you answer my phone? I called you a hundred times.

710
00:48:05,133 --> 00:48:06,900
You should at least leave a message.

711
00:48:06,900 --> 00:48:09,400
Do you know how surprised I was to see a woman I didn't know lying there?

712
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:11,200
Oh, you know me.

713
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:14,500
I'm Sae Yan. We hung out together every weekend at my house.

714
00:48:14,500 --> 00:48:16,933
When you were young…

715
00:48:16,933 --> 00:48:19,833
She's living in Italy now.

716
00:48:19,833 --> 00:48:22,433
- My friend's daughter. 
 - Oh, I see.

717
00:48:22,433 --> 00:48:25,833
So you came all the way from Italy to travel?

718
00:48:25,833 --> 00:48:28,533
I went on a trip to Korea not long ago, but I felt sad after leaving, so I came back.

719
00:48:28,533 --> 00:48:31,033
I saw your home address in my mom's notebook.

720
00:48:31,033 --> 00:48:32,067
She doesn't have any plan.

721
00:48:32,067 --> 00:48:32,967
I came here,

722
00:48:32,967 --> 00:48:37,167
and as expected, it was the old house I was looking for.

723
00:48:37,167 --> 00:48:38,500
The old house?

724
00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:40,500
She's saying it's an antique house.

725
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:42,033
Oh, right. Antique!

726
00:48:42,033 --> 00:48:43,900
Look at these dishes.

727
00:48:43,900 --> 00:48:47,833
Look at this totally old-fashioned, countrified thing.

728
00:48:47,833 --> 00:48:49,500
Old-fashioned, countrified?

729
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:51,567
She's saying it's antique.

730
00:48:51,567 --> 00:48:52,900
Are you her spokesperson?

731
00:48:52,900 --> 00:48:56,167
Anyway, since I'm in Korea, I'm planning to stay at your house for a month.

732
00:48:56,167 --> 00:48:58,067
You're going to live here for a month?

733
00:48:58,067 --> 00:49:00,100
At my house? In my room?

734
00:49:00,100 --> 00:49:04,567
Why are you so surprised? You don't even come home often.

735
00:49:06,100 --> 00:49:08,667
Here, eat my beans.

736
00:49:08,667 --> 00:49:11,967
He can't eat beans.

737
00:49:13,267 --> 00:49:14,800
You don't eat beans.

738
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:17,300
I'm eating this on behalf of her.

739
00:49:17,300 --> 00:49:19,700
She said she can't eat beans.

740
00:49:19,700 --> 00:49:21,567
Being protective?

741
00:49:21,567 --> 00:49:23,333
Beans are good for kids.

742
00:49:23,333 --> 00:49:24,700
And I'm not a kid.

743
00:49:24,700 --> 00:49:26,867
Oh, right!

744
00:49:26,867 --> 00:49:31,367
I bought you gifts, wait.

745
00:49:34,033 --> 00:49:36,600
What's going on, Mom? Do you owe her something? You got money from her?

746
00:49:36,600 --> 00:49:39,200
Seung Hyun, since when have you been eating beans?

747
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:40,767
Why are you two suddenly doing this?

748
00:49:40,767 --> 00:49:44,267
She lived abroad, so she is not good at Korean.

749
00:49:44,267 --> 00:49:46,533
At first, you might get a little upset,

750
00:49:46,533 --> 00:49:49,133
but as you spend more time with her, you'll find she has a good personality

751
00:49:49,133 --> 00:49:52,300
and is very affectionate. Right?

752
00:50:04,467 --> 00:50:06,633
Oh, it's delicious.

753
00:50:07,600 --> 00:50:09,267
- It's a little bit heavy. 
 - Is it delivery?

754
00:50:09,267 --> 00:50:10,933
You don't usually deliver.

755
00:50:10,933 --> 00:50:14,000
- Ma'am. 
 - Oh my.

756
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:15,400
It was heavy, right?

757
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:17,300
I fell while jogging yesterday,

758
00:50:17,300 --> 00:50:19,733
and she saw me and delivered it to me in person.

759
00:50:19,733 --> 00:50:21,633
Thank you.

760
00:50:21,633 --> 00:50:25,667
Oh my, I was at home cutting vegetables and my hands are dirty.

761
00:50:25,667 --> 00:50:28,200
It's warm and nice.

762
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:31,167
This stinky vegetable smell.

763
00:50:31,167 --> 00:50:33,500
Come by next time, and I'll pack some vegetables for you.

764
00:50:33,500 --> 00:50:36,167
Really? That would be good.

765
00:50:36,167 --> 00:50:38,833
 Why is she so good at getting close to people? 

766
00:50:38,833 --> 00:50:40,633
- Ms. Jeon Sae Yan. 
 - Yes.

767
00:50:40,633 --> 00:50:42,233
I came from the community center.

768
00:50:42,233 --> 00:50:47,100
Repair work has been scheduled to begin today on the sidewalk where you fell.

769
00:50:47,100 --> 00:50:48,500
- Really? 
 - What?

770
00:50:48,500 --> 00:50:50,567
The sidewalk in front of that intersection?

771
00:50:50,567 --> 00:50:51,700
Oh, yes, yes.

772
00:50:51,700 --> 00:50:54,633
You always work hard for the country,

773
00:50:54,633 --> 00:50:55,667
so please have a drink.

774
00:50:55,667 --> 00:50:58,900
   

775
00:50:58,900 --> 00:51:04,000
 She took over my family and the neighborhood in one day. 

776
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:09,267
 And soon she left us all confused. 

777
00:51:13,220 --> 00:51:15,470
 ­ What's this? 

778
00:51:39,100 --> 00:51:42,900
Hit it a little higher, a little higher.

779
00:51:46,467 --> 00:51:49,800
Okay, good serve now, like now.

780
00:51:55,733 --> 00:51:58,333
What?

781
00:52:19,132 --> 00:52:22,100
    
 Why isn't it here?

782
00:52:32,033 --> 00:52:33,067
No way.

783
00:52:33,067 --> 00:52:36,233
 Please pick up the balls. Those are important balls. 

784
00:52:41,300 --> 00:52:44,033
Where is it?

785
00:52:47,433 --> 00:52:50,567
My key ring.

786
00:52:50,567 --> 00:52:53,400
It's the key ring that Senior Te Oh gave to me.

787
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:56,400
It's the first birthday gift he gave me.

788
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:58,400
Where is it?

789
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:00,167
Isn't it here?

790
00:53:00,167 --> 00:53:02,333
What is she doing?

791
00:53:02,333 --> 00:53:03,800
Dr. Kyeong is acting weird these days. Right?

792
00:53:03,800 --> 00:53:07,567
She's been acting weird ever since she came back from the U.K.

793
00:53:19,667 --> 00:53:23,000
This is short.

794
00:53:30,100 --> 00:53:31,133
It's not working.

795
00:53:31,133 --> 00:53:34,167
- Try with this one. 
 - Oh, thank you.

796
00:53:34,167 --> 00:53:38,867
Yeah, there has to be a long one so I can find it.

797
00:53:41,867 --> 00:53:45,067
Oh my.

798
00:53:45,800 --> 00:53:47,833
Does it smell good?

799
00:53:47,833 --> 00:53:50,533
You can smell it yourself.

800
00:53:51,033 --> 00:53:54,900
Have you seen the key ring?

801
00:53:55,533 --> 00:53:59,167
Oh, the Eiffel Tower thing?

802
00:53:59,167 --> 00:54:01,300
No.

803
00:54:02,600 --> 00:54:03,933
Oh, that's such a shame.

804
00:54:03,933 --> 00:54:07,300
You cherished it so much that you even developed a metal allergy.

805
00:54:15,100 --> 00:54:17,433
But why are you doing this?

806
00:54:17,433 --> 00:54:20,133
I guess I could buy 20 of those for 10 dollars.

807
00:54:20,133 --> 00:54:23,100
What does price matter? It's the meaning of an object that matters.

808
00:54:23,100 --> 00:54:25,067
That thing?

809
00:54:25,067 --> 00:54:29,100
I'll go to Paris and buy it for you.

810
00:54:29,100 --> 00:54:32,367
So, stop looking for it.

811
00:54:32,367 --> 00:54:34,333
It also matters who gave it to me.

812
00:54:34,333 --> 00:54:36,800
No matter how trivial the object is.

813
00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:41,000
Honestly, weren't you disappointed to receive that as a birthday present?

814
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:42,267
No, I wasn't.

815
00:54:42,267 --> 00:54:44,100
- You're lying. 
 - I don't lie.

816
00:54:44,100 --> 00:54:46,500
Saying that seems like more of a denial.

817
00:54:46,500 --> 00:54:48,067
- No, I don't. 
 - You're lying.

818
00:54:48,067 --> 00:54:51,833
Why do you keep doing this?

819
00:54:51,833 --> 00:54:55,233
- Hello! 
  - Ju Yeon, where are you? 

820
00:54:55,900 --> 00:54:57,867
Senior.

821
00:54:57,867 --> 00:55:00,400
Oh, I'm in the library now.

822
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:02,700
Yes, yes.

823
00:55:04,733 --> 00:55:07,533
You're really good at lying.

824
00:55:07,533 --> 00:55:10,167
It's a white lie.

825
00:55:10,167 --> 00:55:13,067
If you don't want to help, just mind your own business and go.

826
00:55:13,067 --> 00:55:16,400
Well, you know it well. I'm not going to help you.

827
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:18,200
Not at all.

828
00:55:20,200 --> 00:55:22,667
It really annoys me.

829
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:27,500
What a loyal woman to him.

830
00:55:27,500 --> 00:55:30,867
What's so good about that cheap key ring?

831
00:55:34,133 --> 00:55:36,933
Oh my.

832
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:50,967
She looks like she has lost her country.

833
00:55:56,267 --> 00:55:57,900
Why did you call me?

834
00:55:57,900 --> 00:55:59,767
 Why aren't you coming? 

835
00:55:59,767 --> 00:56:02,367
 You said you'd come. I'm waiting. 

836
00:56:02,367 --> 00:56:04,267
I'll go.

837
00:56:09,067 --> 00:56:11,833
My heart, stop pounding.

838
00:56:11,833 --> 00:56:14,900
I have to work overtime today, too.

839
00:56:14,900 --> 00:56:18,333
Well, I'll talk to Ju Yeon and try to get you to skip overtime work.

840
00:56:18,333 --> 00:56:20,700
Who works if I don't work overtime?

841
00:56:20,700 --> 00:56:23,300
Dr. Nam and everyone else has left work.

842
00:56:23,300 --> 00:56:26,133
Ju Yeon is still there.

843
00:56:26,733 --> 00:56:29,400
Dr. Kyeong?

844
00:56:29,400 --> 00:56:32,933
That's a bit…

845
00:56:32,933 --> 00:56:34,367
Just trust me.

846
00:56:34,367 --> 00:56:36,933
If you're so grateful,

847
00:56:36,933 --> 00:56:39,800
why don't you give me a kiss?

848
00:56:48,967 --> 00:56:52,033
What is it?

849
00:56:52,700 --> 00:56:55,567
It's even better.

850
00:56:55,567 --> 00:56:58,233
If her boyfriend is like that,

851
00:56:58,233 --> 00:57:01,100
she'll fall for me in no time.

852
00:57:02,167 --> 00:57:03,600
But what if she sees that scene?

853
00:57:03,600 --> 00:57:04,767
Right.

854
00:57:04,767 --> 00:57:07,500
She should see it for herself and face the truth.

855
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:15,467
 ­Oh gosh! 

856
00:57:15,467 --> 00:57:20,533
Why is she wearing such thin clothes?

857
00:57:20,533 --> 00:57:23,500
Why is her expression like that?

858
00:57:35,500 --> 00:57:38,100
Where is it?

859
00:57:38,100 --> 00:57:40,500
Oh my.

860
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:43,233
Please come out.

861
00:57:43,233 --> 00:57:46,100
Where are you?

862
00:57:46,100 --> 00:57:48,233
Oh my.

863
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:53,400
Did you take this?

864
00:57:53,400 --> 00:57:55,767
I was jealous because you cherished

865
00:57:55,767 --> 00:57:58,000
that thing so much, so I took it.

866
00:57:58,000 --> 00:57:59,900
Now you're taking my things?

867
00:57:59,900 --> 00:58:01,800
Sorry.

868
00:58:02,520 --> 00:58:03,460
What?

869
00:58:03,467 --> 00:58:05,067
Is it over if you say sorry?

870
00:58:05,067 --> 00:58:08,900
Oh, it's cold. Why is it so cold?

871
00:58:09,733 --> 00:58:13,500
What is Senior doing?

872
00:58:17,933 --> 00:58:20,367
Oh, it's hot.

873
00:58:21,067 --> 00:58:22,067
What are you doing?

874
00:58:22,067 --> 00:58:24,900
I'm showing off my charm.

875
00:58:24,900 --> 00:58:27,467
What do you think of the bad guy style?

876
00:58:27,467 --> 00:58:30,400
Is this a bad guy style? You are just a bad guy.

877
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:32,900
Do you like the nice guy style?

878
00:58:32,900 --> 00:58:34,233
Then, I'll treat you nice.

879
00:58:34,233 --> 00:58:37,967
No, thanks. Don't follow me.

880
00:58:38,690 --> 00:58:39,633
Hold on!­

881
00:58:39,633 --> 00:58:42,633
- Where are you going? 
 - Why do you care?

882
00:58:42,633 --> 00:58:43,733
Let's go this way.

883
00:58:43,733 --> 00:58:45,800
Please don't do this.

884
00:58:45,800 --> 00:58:49,667
Why are you acting like this? I said I don't like this.

885
00:58:49,667 --> 00:58:51,800
No, I mean…

886
00:58:54,600 --> 00:58:55,667
Let's go that way.

887
00:58:55,667 --> 00:58:59,800
Why are you being so persistent?

888
00:59:09,700 --> 00:59:12,033
Promise me.

889
00:59:12,033 --> 00:59:14,967
No matter what happens,

890
00:59:14,967 --> 00:59:18,767
don't get shocked or cry.

891
00:59:20,200 --> 00:59:22,933
I guess you don't know anything about me.

892
00:59:22,933 --> 00:59:24,500
I don't cry.

893
00:59:24,500 --> 00:59:27,233
I'm not a character who gets hurt in any situation.

894
00:59:27,233 --> 00:59:28,800
I get sleepy when I cry.

895
00:59:28,800 --> 00:59:30,933
I continue to report and research, report and research.

896
00:59:30,933 --> 00:59:32,800
I wouldn't know if I lost a finger while working.

897
00:59:32,800 --> 00:59:37,700
It's obvious that crying will make me sleepy, so there's nothing good about crying.

898
00:59:38,900 --> 00:59:41,000
Look at me, don't look somewhere else.

899
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:42,700
It's a warning.

900
00:59:42,700 --> 00:59:46,367
If you touch my body once more, I'll not forgive you.

901
00:59:46,367 --> 00:59:49,267
I tried to listen to you as much as I could.

902
00:59:49,267 --> 00:59:52,300
Today, I'm going to do what I want.

903
00:59:52,933 --> 00:59:55,100
I'm afraid that if you get hurt,

904
00:59:55,100 --> 00:59:57,533
I'll get hurt too.

905
00:59:59,440 --> 01:00:07,940


906
01:00:07,940 --> 01:00:16,980
♫  Drowning in an ocean of grey  ♫

907
01:00:19,340 --> 01:00:28,340
♫  Running, running backwards to you  ♫

908
01:00:30,820 --> 01:00:38,430
♫  Drowning, drowning in an ocean of grey  ♫

909
01:00:38,433 --> 01:00:43,433
   

910
01:00:43,433 --> 01:00:45,033
 You gave him permission to go out? 

911
01:00:45,033 --> 01:00:47,033
 My wish was to play tennis with you. 

912
01:00:47,033 --> 01:00:48,967
 If you win at least one set, I'll sign a contract. 

913
01:00:48,967 --> 01:00:50,967
 It sounds like it's because of the money rather than my exercise. 

914
01:00:50,967 --> 01:00:53,533
 We need money to keep your secrets. 

915
01:00:53,533 --> 01:00:54,967
 Are you all right? 

916
01:00:54,967 --> 01:00:56,200
 The player Lee Shin? 

917
01:00:56,200 --> 01:00:57,400
 Talk with me for a moment. 

918
01:00:57,400 --> 01:00:58,700
 I started an agency. 

919
01:00:58,700 --> 01:01:01,533
 What's going on? Is this the Lee Kun I knew before? 

920
01:01:01,533 --> 01:01:04,033
 Is this really the jinx-breaking routine? 

921
01:01:04,033 --> 01:01:05,133
 Something that makes you laugh, 

922
01:01:05,133 --> 01:01:07,133
 something that cheers you up, and something that makes you eat. 

923
01:01:07,133 --> 01:01:10,900
 Either you don't look into what I want or you don't know how to look into it. 

924
01:01:10,900 --> 01:01:12,567
 Winning is not important. 

925
01:01:12,567 --> 01:01:16,667
 What's important is doing something that makes you truly happy.
