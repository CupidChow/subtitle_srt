 ­  

3
00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:18,040
   

4
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:22,820
   

5
00:00:25,533 --> 00:00:33,400
   

6
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:39,480
   

7
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:46,760


8
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:49,633
 Ace serve! A strong serve of 207 km per hour. 

9
00:00:49,633 --> 00:00:50,867
   

10
00:00:50,867 --> 00:00:54,633
 A thirteen-year-old boy is rewriting tennis history. 

11
00:00:54,633 --> 00:00:57,633
 Lee Kun of South Korea. We're so proud of you. 

12
00:00:57,633 --> 00:01:00,367
   
   

13
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:04,700
 He looks so comfortable with himself. 

14
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:06,600
 He manages himself strictly too. 

15
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:10,467
 The ball kid appearing on the screen right now is Lee Kun's younger brother. 

16
00:01:10,467 --> 00:01:13,133
 They're joined at the hip. 

17
00:01:14,133 --> 00:01:16,200
 It's not over yet. 

18
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,967
 You think you can beat me with that gloomy face? 

19
00:01:18,967 --> 00:01:21,333
 You have to win at least one game. 

20
00:01:21,333 --> 00:01:24,100
 The physical battle or the mental battle. 

21
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:26,400
 Shut up! 

22
00:01:27,767 --> 00:01:34,367
 Yes. A family hero will soon become Korea's national hero. 

23
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,830
 ­  

24
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:45,600
 Out. 

25
00:01:54,333 --> 00:01:55,333
 Champion point. 

26
00:01:55,333 --> 00:01:58,367
 To win the Junior World Championships, 

27
00:01:58,367 --> 00:02:02,067
 only one more point to go. 

28
00:02:20,233 --> 00:02:22,500
 No! 

29
00:02:25,667 --> 00:02:26,800
 Game. Kun! 

30
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:31,333
 The winner! Lee Kun is the winner! 

31
00:02:36,467 --> 00:02:40,533
 Lee Kun is lying on the ground. What's happening? 

32
00:02:40,533 --> 00:02:42,967
 Kun! 

33
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:47,400
 Kun, are you okay? 

34
00:02:48,267 --> 00:02:52,572
 What if I hadn't thrown myself that day? 

35
00:02:52,572 --> 00:02:54,133
 Are you okay? 

36
00:02:54,133 --> 00:02:56,300
 Of course, I'm well aware 

37
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:59,433
 that there's nothing I can do to change the past. 

38
00:02:59,433 --> 00:03:01,100
 The harder I try to forget 

39
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:03,933
 this bad memory 

40
00:03:03,933 --> 00:03:08,067
 just gets etched into me like a tattoo. 

41
00:03:14,967 --> 00:03:21,967
   

42
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:58,833
 People say life can change in a split second. 

43
00:03:58,833 --> 00:04:03,667
 What if that moment is a bad memory? 

44
00:04:03,667 --> 00:04:07,100
 Bad memories can cause various psychiatric disorders. 

45
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:11,800
 For instance, posttraumatic stress disorder. 

46
00:04:13,133 --> 00:04:17,367
   

47
00:04:18,567 --> 00:04:20,133
Here is the wine you ordered.

48
00:04:20,133 --> 00:04:22,400
I gave it to you in a large glass this time.

49
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,900
You must be annoyed.

50
00:04:27,467 --> 00:04:30,067
 Low self-esteem and chronic depression. 

51
00:04:30,067 --> 00:04:33,667
I'm not an alcoholic or anything, but…

52
00:04:33,667 --> 00:04:37,500
 Paranoia due to increased emotional response and hallucinatory experiences. 

53
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:38,967
Just because I'm in first class,

54
00:04:38,967 --> 00:04:43,967
I'm not trying to drink a lot to get my money's worth.

55
00:04:43,967 --> 00:04:46,867
 Dysfunctional personality development due to central serotonin deficiency. 

56
00:04:46,867 --> 00:04:50,500
I ran out of small glasses, so I gave it to you in a big one.

57
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:54,600
I'm sorry. I was thinking about something else,

58
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:58,667
so I overreacted.

59
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:01,733
You must be going to your class reunion.

60
00:05:01,733 --> 00:05:04,867
I was going to go to my class reunion

61
00:05:04,867 --> 00:05:08,633
to meet my first love. I'm thinking about it.

62
00:05:08,633 --> 00:05:12,733
But if someone like me confesses his feelings, she wouldn't like it. Right?

63
00:05:12,733 --> 00:05:16,267
 He has low self-esteem, persecution complex, and passive-aggressive behavior too. 

64
00:05:16,267 --> 00:05:17,700
 Of course, it'd be terrible. Why bother asking? 

65
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:21,500
I'm sure she'd be happy if you were to confess to her.

66
00:05:25,333 --> 00:05:29,367
What? Do you have something to say to me?

67
00:05:30,067 --> 00:05:31,433
Well…

68
00:05:31,433 --> 00:05:35,867
I've been watching you for a while…

69
00:05:35,867 --> 00:05:37,300
I have a boyfriend.

70
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:39,667
No, I mean…

71
00:05:51,167 --> 00:05:55,367
- May I have two wet tissues, please? 
 - Sure. One moment, please.

72
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,233
Thank you.

73
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:13,433
Gosh, that startled me.

74
00:06:13,433 --> 00:06:18,267
I wasn't hitting on you.

75
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:29,167
Are you… okay?

76
00:06:29,167 --> 00:06:32,733
My temporary veneer.

77
00:06:32,733 --> 00:06:34,800
My temporary veneer.

78
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:39,100
Your tooth… Did you lose your front tooth?

79
00:06:41,244 --> 00:06:42,767
I'm so relieved.

80
00:06:42,767 --> 00:06:45,767
It's a temporary veneer before I get my dental implant.

81
00:06:45,767 --> 00:06:47,733
- Gosh, I have to give a presentation. 
 - I'm so sorry.

82
00:06:47,733 --> 00:06:49,700
Let me compensate you for it at least.

83
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:52,967
No. It's okay.

84
00:06:52,967 --> 00:06:55,267
But still…

85
00:07:08,667 --> 00:07:11,067
That startled me.

86
00:07:14,567 --> 00:07:19,533
Well, I have important data stored in here.

87
00:07:21,667 --> 00:07:27,933
 We're experiencing turbulence. Please remain in your seat and fasten your seatbelt. 

88
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:34,433
 Are you okay? 

89
00:07:34,433 --> 00:07:38,667
 By any chance… 

90
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:53,400
I'm fine. Just go.

91
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:56,110
Okay.

92
00:07:59,967 --> 00:08:03,932
If you're hurt because of me, please give me a call.

93
00:08:03,932 --> 00:08:06,824
   

94
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:23,767
 We've already moved all our belongings to Australia, Mother. 

95
00:08:23,767 --> 00:08:26,033
 We wanted Kun 

96
00:08:26,033 --> 00:08:30,767
 to train under an Australian coach who is the best in the world. 

97
00:08:30,767 --> 00:08:35,733
 We even used all our retirement money to put down the deposit. 

98
00:08:36,267 --> 00:08:39,800
 We never imagined things would turn out this way. 

99
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:42,667
 But still. 

100
00:08:42,667 --> 00:08:47,833
 How could you leave him behind? He's still a child. 

101
00:08:49,333 --> 00:08:55,433
 We have no choice because of health insurance. 

102
00:08:55,433 --> 00:09:00,333
 And he'd be devastated to watch his brother getting lessons in his place. 

103
00:09:00,333 --> 00:09:05,233
 It was a difficult decision for us too. 

104
00:09:05,233 --> 00:09:08,400
 Please take care of him just for a few years. 

105
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:15,433
 My goodness, my poor grandson. 

106
00:09:23,033 --> 00:09:26,367
 Sweetie, stop. Come on, sweetie. 

107
00:09:27,767 --> 00:09:30,900
 Sweetie. My goodness. 

108
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:33,400
 Kun! 

109
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:39,367
 Mom. 

110
00:09:42,667 --> 00:09:46,800
 Mom. Mom! 

111
00:09:50,433 --> 00:09:53,433
 Mom, take me too! 

112
00:09:54,667 --> 00:09:59,267
 Mom, don't leave me! 

113
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,467
 Mom! 

114
00:10:06,267 --> 00:10:08,300
 My medal. 

115
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:19,933
 Are you okay? Open your eyes. 

116
00:10:21,733 --> 00:10:23,967
 Are you okay? 

117
00:10:29,733 --> 00:10:31,400
Professor Han, I just landed.

118
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,667
I got the documents from the Cambridge Medical Research Institute.

119
00:10:33,667 --> 00:10:37,800
The animal importation procedures are quite strict, so I was delayed a little.

120
00:10:40,367 --> 00:10:43,033
Put it on now.

121
00:10:43,033 --> 00:10:47,033
- Your mom will scold me too. 
 - I don't want to, Father.

122
00:10:47,033 --> 00:10:50,533
   

123
00:10:50,533 --> 00:10:53,067
Here he comes. Here he comes!

124
00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:56,020
   

125
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:58,510
   

126
00:10:58,510 --> 00:11:01,000
   

127
00:11:04,967 --> 00:11:07,333
Did you expect to win?

128
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:10,867
Mr. Lee Shin, please say a word. How do you feel?

129
00:11:10,867 --> 00:11:13,867
Wait, he isn't Lee Shin.

130
00:11:13,867 --> 00:11:15,400
Gosh, what's going on?

131
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:18,633
Hey, he's over there!

132
00:11:31,067 --> 00:11:33,233
I'm sorry.

133
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:48,100
- What? 
 - Can I have that?

134
00:11:51,633 --> 00:11:52,833
Mr. Lee, please say a word.

135
00:11:52,833 --> 00:11:55,867
Please tell us your determination going forward.

136
00:11:55,867 --> 00:12:00,233
"Let's win one at least. The physical battle or the mental battle."

137
00:12:00,233 --> 00:12:03,133
Wait, just one word. Please.

138
00:12:03,133 --> 00:12:05,300
 You have to win at least one game. 

139
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:07,667
 The physical battle or the mental battle. 

140
00:12:07,667 --> 00:12:09,067
How unoriginal.

141
00:12:09,067 --> 00:12:13,100
- Mr. Lee! 
 - Let's talk next time.

142
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:17,460
Hey!

143
00:12:21,533 --> 00:12:22,967
You've been a professional athlete for many years now.

144
00:12:22,967 --> 00:12:25,500
How are you still nervous in front of the camera?

145
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:28,200
You're taking good care of your mental health, right?

146
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:31,633
- Yes. 
 - That isn't Shin's fault.

147
00:12:31,633 --> 00:12:35,133
I told him to keep them busy until we got out, but he couldn't even do that.

148
00:12:35,133 --> 00:12:39,600
It's not Kun's fault, either. Don't blame him.

149
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,833
Hey, Kun. Where is he?

150
00:12:42,833 --> 00:12:46,700
- Hey, Kun! 
 - Oh, my. Did he not get on?

151
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:48,967
 Hey, son. Take a deluxe taxi home. 

152
00:12:48,967 --> 00:12:52,900
 Just charge Shin's credit card all you want. 

153
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:23,767
   

154
00:13:23,767 --> 00:13:25,833
Hello.

155
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:34,633
Thank you.

156
00:13:34,633 --> 00:13:37,467
Success. Finally here. Let's go.

157
00:13:37,467 --> 00:13:40,200
His name is Mouse No. 107.

158
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:44,967
Three months ago, he experienced an electric shock trying to fetch food.

159
00:13:44,967 --> 00:13:48,800
After that, even if we gave him delicious food or made his surroundings comfortable,

160
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,700
he kept getting indigestion.

161
00:13:57,340 --> 00:13:58,950
 Look at that. 

162
00:14:01,667 --> 00:14:05,733
A bad memory. Everyone has at least one bad memory, right?

163
00:14:05,733 --> 00:14:08,533
A memory of a serious accident that caused physical harm.

164
00:14:08,533 --> 00:14:10,700
A harsh word uttered by a family member at times.

165
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:15,433
Or the moment you were mercilessly abandoned by someone you loved.

166
00:14:15,433 --> 00:14:20,100
Once a bad memory gets created, it turns into an irreversible trauma.

167
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:25,167
Bad memories that are painful, upsetting, and bitter.

168
00:14:25,167 --> 00:14:29,467
What if you can erase them forever?

169
00:14:29,467 --> 00:14:35,067
For example, what if there is a bad memory eraser?

170
00:14:53,267 --> 00:14:55,533
Gosh, it's so cold.

171
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:43,100
Hey, you're home.

172
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:45,267
I don't know about anything else, but you won't go hungry at least.

173
00:15:45,267 --> 00:15:47,467
Hey, you took a taxi home. Right?

174
00:15:47,467 --> 00:15:51,000
You needed to get on quickly. You missed the car by moving so slowly.

175
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,267
Go get changed and come back out.

176
00:15:54,890 --> 00:15:56,610
That's not...

177
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:00,467
Hey, Shin.

178
00:16:01,567 --> 00:16:02,767
I don't want to.

179
00:16:02,767 --> 00:16:04,800
Come on. Go.

180
00:16:11,167 --> 00:16:12,333
Brother, come eat.

181
00:16:12,333 --> 00:16:14,767
Gosh, seriously.

182
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,100
I don't want to eat.

183
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:23,867
Okay. I just need to get kimchi.

184
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,233
Why did you have to put the kimchi refrigerator in my room?

185
00:16:32,233 --> 00:16:35,033
You're the one who moved into the kimchi storage room.

186
00:16:35,033 --> 00:16:39,133
You moved in out of nowhere after going out of business.

187
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:01,830
   

188
00:17:01,830 --> 00:17:03,800
    
    

189
00:17:14,067 --> 00:17:15,900
Do you think you're a ninja?

190
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:18,600
Why do you always wear black?

191
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:20,733
Wear something bright.

192
00:17:20,733 --> 00:17:22,500
Stop slouching too.

193
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:26,567
Okay. I'm sorry.

194
00:17:26,567 --> 00:17:30,900
You keep apologizing at the end of every sentence. Stop doing that.

195
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:32,933
Okay, I'm sorry…

196
00:17:35,133 --> 00:17:36,400
Chicken breast again.

197
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:40,133
I hate you, but you must really hate me too.

198
00:17:40,133 --> 00:17:42,867
I don't eat boiled meat.

199
00:17:42,867 --> 00:17:44,833
Can you make the menu more even

200
00:17:44,833 --> 00:17:48,333
by switching off between chicken soup and tongdak (whole fried chicken)? Wouldn't that be great?

201
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:50,567
Mom cooked this with love. Eat up, okay?

202
00:17:50,567 --> 00:17:53,100
I haven't tasted it yet, but I'm sure it's delicious.

203
00:17:53,933 --> 00:17:56,533
Here's a drumstick.

204
00:17:56,533 --> 00:17:58,000
Gosh, it's hot.

205
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,900
Are you all right?

206
00:18:00,567 --> 00:18:03,867
All moms must be invincible.

207
00:18:03,867 --> 00:18:07,900
I'd gladly sacrifice my hands for my child. You must've been hungry.

208
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:12,300
 What's certain is that she wasn't referring to me when she said, "my child." 

209
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:15,533
 The pecking order is obvious just from the order of food being served. 

210
00:18:15,533 --> 00:18:17,267
 First in line. 

211
00:18:17,267 --> 00:18:20,100
 Second in line. 

212
00:18:22,967 --> 00:18:25,800
 Third in line. 

213
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:29,033
 The once successful eldest son of this family is in last place now. 

214
00:18:29,033 --> 00:18:31,033
Here.

215
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,133
 Perhaps, I was mistaken. 

216
00:18:35,133 --> 00:18:37,133
 She must've felt bad about what happened at the airport. 

217
00:18:37,133 --> 00:18:40,433
 Maybe because I worked hard serving as Shin's manager in the UK? 

218
00:18:40,433 --> 00:18:45,033
 Or because I'm the eldest son, the pillar of this family? 

219
00:18:45,033 --> 00:18:47,233
Give it to Cola.

220
00:18:47,933 --> 00:18:50,233
 Fourth in line. 

221
00:18:50,233 --> 00:18:53,500
 I'm last in line behind the dog. 

222
00:18:55,533 --> 00:18:59,867
 The issue is that even the dog knows that. 

223
00:18:59,867 --> 00:19:02,633
 I must teach the dog a lesson that I come before him. 

224
00:19:02,633 --> 00:19:04,533
Hey.

225
00:19:07,967 --> 00:19:09,900
I'd stop if I were you.

226
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:12,133
Lee Kun.

227
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:21,667
Hey, you…

228
00:19:21,667 --> 00:19:24,900
Let me tell you a secret about your birth.

229
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:30,033
Your mom and dad are not the same breed.

230
00:19:30,033 --> 00:19:33,767
You're a crossbreed.

231
00:19:33,767 --> 00:19:35,933
A mutt!

232
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,400
Come on, do something.

233
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,433
Did you bite Cola?

234
00:19:45,433 --> 00:19:47,467
Cola!

235
00:19:49,867 --> 00:19:51,600
Hey, what's wrong?

236
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:54,233
You mutt.

237
00:19:54,233 --> 00:19:56,633
You mutt!

238
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:03,100
Great. It's really great.

239
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:05,300
You know that the minister is coming to our school presentation tomorrow. Right?

240
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:07,033
Yes, please don't worry a thing.

241
00:20:07,033 --> 00:20:09,533
We'll make sure…

242
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,967
to prepare thoroughly.

243
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:21,700
You'll be able to showcase the mouse you brought back from the UK, right?

244
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:23,950
Yes, sir.

245
00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:24,940
Yes?

246
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:27,733
Absolutely.

247
00:20:27,733 --> 00:20:30,033
Why don't we go now, sir?

248
00:20:30,033 --> 00:20:31,833
Yes, let's go.

249
00:20:37,767 --> 00:20:39,500
Ju Yeon.

250
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:41,267
Tenior.

251
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,967
I heard that you gave a great presentation as soon as you got back.

252
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:56,333
Aren't you happy to see me? It's been four months.

253
00:20:56,333 --> 00:20:57,667
Good job.

254
00:20:57,667 --> 00:21:00,433
- Thank you. 
 - You held up well.

255
00:21:09,467 --> 00:21:13,700
Out of all people, why did it have to happen in front of senior Te Oh? Because of that loser.

256
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:17,533
No, something good's about to happen. Lightning never strikes twice.

257
00:21:17,533 --> 00:21:22,800
Once tomorrow's presentation goes well, I'll have plenty of time for dates with senior.

258
00:21:25,067 --> 00:21:26,067
   

259
00:21:26,067 --> 00:21:30,067
They've been so hard on us saying our team spends too much money.

260
00:21:30,067 --> 00:21:35,567
But at last, our brain research center will achieve our dream of extending the human lifespan!

261
00:21:37,867 --> 00:21:41,433
Now that Dr. Kyeong is back and the result is good too,

262
00:21:41,433 --> 00:21:45,100
shall we go for a team dinner? Let's go?

263
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:48,000
Korean, Chinese, or Japanese cuisine? Or chicken and beer?

264
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,233
Let's go for beef and beer. Beef and beer!

265
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:54,330
Beef and beer!

266
00:21:54,333 --> 00:21:57,000
Call them.

267
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,700
Hello? May I make a reservation?

268
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:00,400
We have to work late tonight.

269
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,367
I'll call you back.

270
00:22:02,367 --> 00:22:05,933
Please hold your horses and prepare thoroughly, so that tomorrow's presentation goes smoothly.

271
00:22:05,933 --> 00:22:09,100
Please keep checking the humidity, temperature, and bowel movements of Mouse No. 107.

272
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:12,400
I don't want six years of our research to go down the drain.

273
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:15,400
Then, we'll be off to the clean room now.

274
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:18,500
- Yes, let's go. 
 - We'll go now.

275
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:24,733
You're so heartless.

276
00:22:24,733 --> 00:22:27,467
Do you know what the researchers call you?

277
00:22:27,467 --> 00:22:28,867
Elsa!

278
00:22:28,867 --> 00:22:33,133
You can kill the greatest mood at once and make people feel like they're walking on eggshells.

279
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:37,367
Keep up the good work.

280
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:43,033
You're a psychiatrist. How can you be so cold-hearted?

281
00:22:43,033 --> 00:22:47,033
Do you even know that I'm handling all the complaints you get from the patients?

282
00:22:47,033 --> 00:22:50,200
That's why I asked you to spare me from counseling patients in detail.

283
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,867
You know that I'm not good at that.

284
00:22:51,867 --> 00:22:55,433
It's not that you're not good. You're just not interested.

285
00:22:55,433 --> 00:22:58,500
I've given everything for this research under Professor Han since medical school.

286
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:00,500
My life depends on this.

287
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:05,200
If anything goes wrong, I'll not forgive them.

288
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:11,040
Okay.

289
00:23:15,333 --> 00:23:16,867
Are those documents from the U.K.?

290
00:23:16,867 --> 00:23:18,433
Gosh, my head hurts. I'm so jet-lagged.

291
00:23:18,433 --> 00:23:20,667
I'm sorry. They're your personal belongings.

292
00:23:20,667 --> 00:23:23,933
- Show me after you unpack. 
 - Okay.

293
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:30,833
   

294
00:23:30,833 --> 00:23:33,167
What? This isn't my bag.

295
00:23:33,167 --> 00:23:37,340
My bag was swapped with that of a man who was obsessed with wearing all black.

296
00:23:38,067 --> 00:23:41,433
It has important documents that the future of humanity depends on…

297
00:23:41,433 --> 00:23:45,100
Forget it. May I have his contact information?

298
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:46,600
I…

299
00:23:51,267 --> 00:23:52,800
Okay, understood.

300
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:54,833
Hello, Dr. Kyeong.

301
00:23:57,633 --> 00:24:01,833
His number is written here. How did I miss that? Gosh.

302
00:24:01,833 --> 00:24:03,900
 The line is busy. Please leave a message after the beep… 

303
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:07,633
Who on earth is he talking to?

304
00:24:07,633 --> 00:24:09,800
Why are you calling me in the middle of a lesson?

305
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:12,933
I'm so frustrated teaching elementary school kids.

306
00:24:14,133 --> 00:24:16,200
You got the invitation for the class reunion, right?

307
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,967
You're going tomorrow no matter what, right?

308
00:24:17,967 --> 00:24:19,967
- I'm not sure. 
  - What? 

309
00:24:19,967 --> 00:24:23,767
Your first love you've been longing for might come. You have to go no matter what.

310
00:24:23,767 --> 00:24:26,833
 Our school was the only elementary school in that tiny little rural town. 

311
00:24:26,833 --> 00:24:30,900
 You can ask around at least, right? 

312
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:33,133
When will you be able to find her again if you miss this opportunity?

313
00:24:33,133 --> 00:24:36,100
Just go and be a man, okay?

314
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:37,867
"I've liked you for a long time."

315
00:24:37,867 --> 00:24:40,500
"Let's go out." Just tell her that.

316
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:44,133
Okay, take a break for five minutes.

317
00:24:44,133 --> 00:24:48,567
Even if we were to see each other again, why would she like someone like me?

318
00:24:51,167 --> 00:24:53,667
You're so frustrating.

319
00:24:53,667 --> 00:24:56,100
You have such low self-esteem, man.

320
00:24:56,100 --> 00:25:00,133
 You've got to have high self-esteem to succeed in love or career, okay? 

321
00:25:00,133 --> 00:25:01,440
No.

322
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:05,140
You must succeed to have self-esteem.

323
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:07,800
An extra...

324
00:25:09,233 --> 00:25:13,567
could never catch up to the lead character. Never.

325
00:25:30,167 --> 00:25:32,167
Excuse me.

326
00:25:32,167 --> 00:25:33,900
You can't park here.

327
00:25:35,867 --> 00:25:37,400
Please leave now.

328
00:25:43,033 --> 00:25:45,700
Pardon me. Where can I park then?

329
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:47,567
   

330
00:25:54,633 --> 00:25:56,067
   

331
00:25:56,067 --> 00:25:59,033
What? You've never seen anyone taking a dump?

332
00:26:16,967 --> 00:26:18,733
Why do you…

333
00:26:22,133 --> 00:26:24,367
Awesome. You're that guy, right?

334
00:26:24,367 --> 00:26:25,733
The legendary tennis genius.

335
00:26:25,733 --> 00:26:27,000
If you're looking for Lee Shin…

336
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,033
You're Lee Kun, the tennis player.

337
00:26:29,033 --> 00:26:30,567
Right?

338
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:35,267
Yes… I am.

339
00:26:35,267 --> 00:26:36,667
Awesome.

340
00:26:36,667 --> 00:26:38,867
I'm a big fan of yours.

341
00:26:38,867 --> 00:26:42,233
I started playing tennis after watching your footage.

342
00:26:42,233 --> 00:26:46,400
Oh, you're Cha Si On, right?

343
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,667
You're under this agency too?

344
00:26:48,667 --> 00:26:50,067
Agency…

345
00:26:50,067 --> 00:26:52,467
- Yes… 
 - Awesome.

346
00:26:52,467 --> 00:26:54,133
Are you playing tennis again?

347
00:26:54,133 --> 00:26:57,233
You were the first Korean to win a world championship medal, too.

348
00:26:57,233 --> 00:26:59,433
Can you show me the medal sometime?

349
00:26:59,433 --> 00:27:02,733
The medal? I lost it.

350
00:27:02,733 --> 00:27:04,833
You lost the medal?

351
00:27:04,833 --> 00:27:08,333
What? That's crazy. How awful.

352
00:27:08,333 --> 00:27:10,500
Then, do a rally with me sometime. Okay?

353
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:14,167
Sure, why not? I'm busy, but I'll try to make time.

354
00:27:14,167 --> 00:27:16,933
For real? All right!

355
00:27:19,167 --> 00:27:20,767
Hey, look who's here.

356
00:27:20,767 --> 00:27:23,660
Ms. Cha Si On, the nation's favorite girl is here.

357
00:27:24,433 --> 00:27:27,267
Shall we go inside? Let's go.

358
00:27:27,267 --> 00:27:29,500
See this? Look.

359
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:31,233
Shin's picture is here too.

360
00:27:31,233 --> 00:27:34,200
We'll put your pictures all along the wall too, Si On.

361
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:36,233
Ms. Cha Si On is here.

362
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:44,733
Oh, I forgot my pen.

363
00:27:47,833 --> 00:27:52,600
Hello, manager. Could you please get me a nice, cold drink?

364
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:57,000
Someone scribbled on my face. It really pisses me off.

365
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,710
An inside job.

366
00:27:59,533 --> 00:28:01,233
Anything cold will do.

367
00:28:01,233 --> 00:28:04,800
Cold yuja tea with lots of whipped cream...

368
00:28:05,667 --> 00:28:07,833
and caramel syrup, please.

369
00:28:13,567 --> 00:28:15,233
- Hello? 
 - Hello?

370
00:28:15,233 --> 00:28:17,233
This is Mr. Lee Kun's number, right? About the luggage—

371
00:28:17,233 --> 00:28:20,167
- No, thanks. 
  - Hello? Please hold on. 

372
00:28:20,167 --> 00:28:21,667
I'm the owner of that luggage.

373
00:28:21,667 --> 00:28:23,867
Our bags got switched.

374
00:28:23,867 --> 00:28:25,433
The airport called me already.

375
00:28:25,433 --> 00:28:27,533
Then, why didn't you answer my calls?

376
00:28:27,533 --> 00:28:30,233
- I called and texted you so many times. 
 - Your order is ready.

377
00:28:30,233 --> 00:28:32,633
I'll send it over to you this week,

378
00:28:32,633 --> 00:28:34,000
so please text me your address.

379
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,467
 When? Hello 

380
00:28:38,067 --> 00:28:39,367
Excuse me.

381
00:28:39,367 --> 00:28:43,200
You didn't put enough whipped cream.

382
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:47,233
What's wrong with him? He thinks he's the only one who is busy?

383
00:28:47,233 --> 00:28:49,200
He's driving me nuts.

384
00:28:56,580 --> 00:28:58,100
Oh dear.

385
00:28:58,100 --> 00:28:59,600
Come in, Kun.

386
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,870
What? Hi, mister.

387
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:03,800
Come sit over here.

388
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:05,767
I said, come in.

389
00:29:09,030 --> 00:29:10,470
Gosh.

390
00:29:23,767 --> 00:29:25,667
Go make a copy.

391
00:29:28,633 --> 00:29:31,390
As for the advertisement…

392
00:29:31,390 --> 00:29:33,730
 Si On and... 

393
00:29:33,733 --> 00:29:36,000
Data is nothing but numbers.

394
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,067
What matters is systematic analysis.

395
00:29:38,067 --> 00:29:40,867
Oh, please do it for me.

396
00:29:40,867 --> 00:29:42,233
Come on.

397
00:29:48,367 --> 00:29:49,800
Do you want me to?

398
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:51,367
One moment.

399
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:01,733
Your stroke speed is good

400
00:30:01,733 --> 00:30:03,767
as well as your muscle mass, but…

401
00:30:06,233 --> 00:30:07,833
What's wrong?

402
00:30:09,167 --> 00:30:11,067
It's been progressing quite a bit.

403
00:30:11,067 --> 00:30:14,120
You injured your knee, didn't you?

404
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:16,933
Hey!

405
00:30:16,933 --> 00:30:18,667
Are you out of your mind?

406
00:30:18,667 --> 00:30:21,500
Don't you dare jinx things by mentioning injuries to an athlete.

407
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:23,500
Mind your business, okay?

408
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:26,700
I'm letting you be Shin's manager because he asked me.

409
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:29,867
You're mooching off your little brother.

410
00:30:32,133 --> 00:30:36,133
Hey, why don't you go make a copy of these?

411
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:44,833
 What's his problem? 

412
00:30:44,833 --> 00:30:47,567
 He doesn't know how to handle his own matters. 

413
00:30:47,567 --> 00:30:48,767
 He's always causing trouble. 

414
00:30:48,767 --> 00:30:53,133
 Gosh, I thought he was a tennis genius, but actually, he's a total loser. 

415
00:30:53,133 --> 00:30:56,133
 What? Did he get into trouble again? 

416
00:30:56,133 --> 00:31:00,267
 His little brother is doing so great. What's wrong with him? 

417
00:31:00,267 --> 00:31:02,400
 What a loser. 

418
00:31:14,930 --> 00:31:18,333
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

419
00:31:20,733 --> 00:31:24,067
Excuse me. I sent you so many text messages. Shouldn't you reply me by now at least?

420
00:31:24,067 --> 00:31:25,467
Can't you be a little considerate?

421
00:31:25,467 --> 00:31:28,400
Call me as soon as you turn on your phone!

422
00:31:28,933 --> 00:31:34,567
Please call me right way. I beg you. Just a text message will do.

423
00:31:48,367 --> 00:31:50,410
Dr. Kyeong.

424
00:31:51,167 --> 00:31:53,533
It's a type of anxiety disorder.

425
00:31:53,533 --> 00:31:57,000
If you do things to change up your mood, meet up with some friends,

426
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:00,000
or make yourself believe that you left your worries behind,

427
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,600
your anxious feeling

428
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:06,700
will ease up quite a bit.

429
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:11,200
I feel like the earth is spinning.

430
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:15,767
Dr. Kyeong, I must go now.

431
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:18,700
The earth is spinning. It's spinning.

432
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:22,580
 It's spinning, spinning. 

433
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:34,600
 The phone is powered off… 

434
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:36,933
Gosh, seriously. Is this guy a con artist?

435
00:32:36,933 --> 00:32:38,367
Is he trying to get money out of me?

436
00:32:38,367 --> 00:32:43,190
I hope he isn't a broker who sells documents to another hospital research lab for money.

437
00:32:43,190 --> 00:32:45,320
Seriously!

438
00:32:47,067 --> 00:32:49,233
Hello?

439
00:32:49,233 --> 00:32:51,533
An emergency patient?

440
00:32:52,267 --> 00:32:55,100
- Can you tell me about the patient? 
 - He has wrist pain.

441
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:56,800
Wrist pain?

442
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:59,167
Why did you call me instead of neurosurgery or orthopedics?

443
00:32:59,167 --> 00:33:02,400
He's a former patient of Professor Han, but he isn't here.

444
00:33:05,733 --> 00:33:08,367
- Where is the patient? 
 - This way, please.

445
00:33:09,230 --> 00:33:12,167
Doctor, my wrist hurts so much.

446
00:33:12,167 --> 00:33:14,600
Please give me some painkillers.

447
00:33:18,567 --> 00:33:20,000
Can you describe the pain?

448
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,500
You're a psychiatrist.

449
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:25,033
Please call a neurosurgeon.

450
00:33:25,033 --> 00:33:26,833
You heard the result of your CT scan, right?

451
00:33:26,833 --> 00:33:31,000
Please administer the strongest one you have here. Nothing else will work.

452
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:34,767
That shot is for critically ill patients only.

453
00:33:34,767 --> 00:33:39,600
I've been ill for 15 years. How much worse must I be to be considered critically ill?

454
00:33:40,667 --> 00:33:42,333
Please hand me a hammer.

455
00:33:42,333 --> 00:33:43,533
Pardon me?

456
00:33:43,533 --> 00:33:45,933
I must crush his arm to give him that shot.

457
00:33:45,933 --> 00:33:48,600
You don't know anything about pain.

458
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:53,200
I don't care if it's a neurosurgeon or a pain specialist. Get me anyone. Please!

459
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:58,433
You know that it's somatization disorder caused by neurosis, right? It's fake pain.

460
00:34:01,333 --> 00:34:05,433
I don't want psychiatric treatment.

461
00:34:05,433 --> 00:34:10,033
It won't work anyway and my pain will remain.

462
00:34:13,433 --> 00:34:17,000
Okay, fine. I'll administer a tranquilizer.

463
00:34:27,233 --> 00:34:28,733
What was that for?

464
00:34:28,733 --> 00:34:31,667
How do you feel? Your right wrist isn't hurting anymore, is it?

465
00:34:31,667 --> 00:34:34,400
You came in regularly for ten years, but haven't been doing that lately.

466
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:36,400
You've only been coming to the emergency room biweekly.

467
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:38,833
I tried everything over ten years,

468
00:34:38,833 --> 00:34:41,533
including hypnosis and neurofeedback.

469
00:34:41,533 --> 00:34:44,167
How much longer must I endure to forget?

470
00:34:44,167 --> 00:34:46,200
Ten more years?

471
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:48,533
Or 20 more years? Or only after I die?

472
00:34:48,533 --> 00:34:54,233
If you keep getting treatments that are right for you, you'll get better eventually.

473
00:34:55,100 --> 00:35:00,233
Then, you must be living your life forgetting all the bad memories.

474
00:35:00,233 --> 00:35:05,700
I would sell my soul to you if only I could forget it.

475
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:11,600
I'm not done treating you. Where are you going?

476
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:13,967
What a great doctor you are.

477
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:17,667
My wrist doesn't hurt at all anymore.

478
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,767
Have you decided to meet her?

479
00:35:22,767 --> 00:35:24,933
Your first love?

480
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:30,200
Aren't you so traumatized that

481
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:34,400
you're even afraid of meeting your first love?

482
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:37,000
Because bad memories can be offset by good memories

483
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:40,100
once you meet her without being afraid...

484
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:44,433
What if even good memories turn into bad memories?

485
00:35:44,433 --> 00:35:46,933
Will you take responsibility?

486
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:56,733
What should we do?

487
00:35:56,733 --> 00:35:59,133
He said, he's fine now.

488
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:02,330
    
    

489
00:36:02,333 --> 00:36:05,900
It doesn't state what his traumatic memories are about.

490
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:11,133
Lee Kun.

491
00:36:11,133 --> 00:36:14,733
Lee Kun? Wait, Lee Kun?

492
00:36:21,767 --> 00:36:26,667
Is he the owner of the luggage then?

493
00:36:26,667 --> 00:36:29,100
Please excuse me for a moment.

494
00:36:30,533 --> 00:36:31,967
You fool.

495
00:36:31,967 --> 00:36:33,733
Why do you not want to go?

496
00:36:33,733 --> 00:36:36,833
This could be your one and only chance.

497
00:36:38,967 --> 00:36:41,333
I'm not going.

498
00:36:41,667 --> 00:36:44,433
You punk. You're like wired earphones.

499
00:36:44,433 --> 00:36:47,933
You keep getting tangled no matter how hard I try.

500
00:36:47,933 --> 00:36:51,000
It's like a Pandora's box.

501
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:54,100
I'm afraid to open it.

502
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:56,333
I see.

503
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,367
It's scary to open it.

504
00:36:58,367 --> 00:37:00,700
It's like going into a public restroom…

505
00:37:04,067 --> 00:37:06,267
 And the toilet seat lid is down. 

506
00:37:06,267 --> 00:37:08,300
I wonder what's inside.

507
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:11,133
 You're so afraid to lift it up. 

508
00:37:12,267 --> 00:37:14,733
 And your stomach cramps are getting worse. 

509
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:18,933
 You have no choice, so with the tips of your fingers, 

510
00:37:18,933 --> 00:37:22,200
 you lift it up mustering up the courage. 

511
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:23,867
Poop.

512
00:37:23,867 --> 00:37:26,933
Chicken gizzard. Eat up.

513
00:37:30,267 --> 00:37:32,700
It's no big deal once you open it.

514
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:34,133
Hey, just lift it up and see.

515
00:37:34,133 --> 00:37:36,200
Worst-case scenario, it's just poop.

516
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:40,033
Well, rejection is the worst thing that could happen, you know?

517
00:37:42,067 --> 00:37:44,400
I hate myself

518
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:46,867
for being like this too.

519
00:37:48,430 --> 00:37:50,867
I have no confidence.

520
00:37:52,433 --> 00:37:54,000
So, can I ask you a favor?

521
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:58,133
Can you go to the class reunion tomorrow and ask around for me

522
00:37:58,133 --> 00:38:02,620
to see if anyone knows… the girl...

523
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:08,400
who was with me? Just her name at least.

524
00:38:09,333 --> 00:38:11,233
Crazy punk.

525
00:38:11,233 --> 00:38:13,633
Help me, man.

526
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:20,867
 I'm the doctor from earlier today. 

527
00:38:20,867 --> 00:38:23,933
And I'm the owner of that luggage.

528
00:38:23,933 --> 00:38:27,633
I didn't call you so late because of my luggage.

529
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:32,700
 I spoke too hastily without knowing what memory caused your trauma. 

530
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:37,067
 But I didn't underestimate the seriousness of your pain. 

531
00:38:38,233 --> 00:38:41,533
 I won't be irresponsible and cliché to say that time will help you forget. 

532
00:38:41,533 --> 00:38:45,467
 I won't. I can't say that, either. 

533
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:51,433
But just drop in whenever you feel upset.

534
00:38:51,433 --> 00:38:56,500
You won't be able to forget, but you can get used to it at least.

535
00:39:18,733 --> 00:39:23,800
I'll be able to become happy like you now, right?

536
00:39:42,033 --> 00:39:46,200
 I'll bring your luggage to the hospital tomorrow morning. 

537
00:39:50,567 --> 00:39:54,767
Let's make history tomorrow.

538
00:40:04,733 --> 00:40:06,900
What's wrong with this?

539
00:40:24,933 --> 00:40:28,700
What's on my calendar today? Let's see.

540
00:40:30,533 --> 00:40:33,033
A class reunion invitation?

541
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:36,400
I'm so envious.

542
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:38,267
I lived in Australia the whole time,

543
00:40:38,267 --> 00:40:41,867
so I have no classmates in Korea.

544
00:40:41,867 --> 00:40:43,700
It sounds fun.

545
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:47,533
Should I go tell them that I'm your little brother to bring up your status?

546
00:40:47,533 --> 00:40:51,533
I can go help you out.

547
00:40:54,867 --> 00:40:59,133
My goodness. How scary.

548
00:41:06,033 --> 00:41:09,667
You have to come at once when I text you later, okay?

549
00:41:14,767 --> 00:41:18,000
Can't he just forget that memory?

550
00:41:24,470 --> 00:41:26,680
    ­ 

551
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:39,100
 Please leave a message after the beep… 

552
00:41:44,567 --> 00:41:46,367
    
 Lastly,

553
00:41:46,367 --> 00:41:48,633
our brain research center…

554
00:41:48,633 --> 00:41:51,367
No, the future of our hospital is in your hands.

555
00:41:51,367 --> 00:41:53,567
If we don't secure this budget, we won't be able to continue our research.

556
00:41:53,567 --> 00:41:55,067
You can't allow any mistakes.

557
00:41:55,067 --> 00:41:57,000
Yes, sir.

558
00:41:57,633 --> 00:42:00,633
Really, one final comment. That mouse is sensitive to strong lights, right?

559
00:42:00,633 --> 00:42:02,300
Make sure to check the lighting in the seminar room.

560
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:04,767
Yes, sir.

561
00:42:04,767 --> 00:42:07,367
Now really, one final comment.

562
00:42:15,233 --> 00:42:18,800
You even grouped them by color today.

563
00:42:19,533 --> 00:42:22,000
Ta-da.

564
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:23,867
I hope you like it.

565
00:42:23,867 --> 00:42:29,133
You know that you're on the blacklist of athletes who get psychological care, right?

566
00:42:29,133 --> 00:42:32,267
We've known each other for so long.

567
00:42:32,933 --> 00:42:34,800
Please keep it a secret from my coach

568
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:38,067
and prescribe it exactly the same.

569
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:42,700
You don't have to tell me. I know what you need by looking at the way you act. Don't you worry.

570
00:42:42,700 --> 00:42:46,733
I'm busy today, so leave now.

571
00:42:48,167 --> 00:42:50,200
Do you have a blind date?

572
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:53,033
My future sister-in-law who you've been waiting for 50 years.

573
00:42:53,033 --> 00:42:55,767
Do I finally get to meet her?

574
00:42:55,767 --> 00:42:58,333
Don't even bring up that topic unless you're setting me up with someone.

575
00:42:58,333 --> 00:43:01,533
I have something more important than that. A research presentation, okay?

576
00:43:04,300 --> 00:43:05,700
It's the document that I'm presenting today.

577
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:10,367
I even used premium paper. What do I do?

578
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:13,433
"Bad Memory Eraser"?

579
00:43:13,433 --> 00:43:15,900
Hey, this is a top-secret document.

580
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:18,167
You can erase memories?

581
00:43:18,167 --> 00:43:19,833
Bad memories?

582
00:43:19,833 --> 00:43:22,200
It's more like hiding them, not erasing.

583
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:25,467
You're tricking the brain in a way.

584
00:43:25,467 --> 00:43:27,533
Gosh, I'm busy. Get out.

585
00:43:27,533 --> 00:43:28,967
Gosh, seriously.

586
00:43:28,967 --> 00:43:31,733
Gosh, what am I going to do? Is it okay now?

587
00:43:34,967 --> 00:43:38,833
Erase just the bad memories?

588
00:43:40,633 --> 00:43:42,933
Are you here? Where are you?

589
00:43:42,933 --> 00:43:47,233
Yes, I'll be right there with your luggage.

590
00:43:48,900 --> 00:43:51,300
Yes, Professor. Has the minister arrived?

591
00:43:51,300 --> 00:43:54,100
I need five minutes… Actually, could you give me ten minutes, please?

592
00:43:54,100 --> 00:43:56,233
We can do it.

593
00:43:56,233 --> 00:43:58,233
- Be careful. Be careful. 
 - It's okay. It's okay.

594
00:43:58,233 --> 00:44:00,433
It's okay. I'm sorry.

595
00:44:00,433 --> 00:44:01,733
It's okay. It's okay.

596
00:44:01,733 --> 00:44:04,500
- Be careful. 
- We're just moving. It's okay.

597
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:07,033
There we go.

598
00:44:11,833 --> 00:44:14,167
I'll make it dark for you.

599
00:44:17,167 --> 00:44:18,167
Welcome.

600
00:44:18,167 --> 00:44:19,633
  ­ 

601
00:44:19,633 --> 00:44:20,633
Sir.

602
00:44:20,633 --> 00:44:22,000
- Minister. Thank you for coming. 
 - My goodness, sir.

603
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:25,567
- Welcome. 
 - Thank you for your hard work.

604
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:27,900
I want to be reborn as him in my next life.

605
00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:30,700
He's the second-most valuable mouse after Mickey Mouse.

606
00:44:30,700 --> 00:44:33,133
He is worth more than the two of us combined.

607
00:44:33,133 --> 00:44:35,200
He's worth ten billion won, you know?

608
00:44:36,392 --> 00:44:38,462
Dr. Nam! No!

609
00:44:52,633 --> 00:44:55,100
Wait, he isn't inside!

610
00:44:58,667 --> 00:45:01,067
Everyone, don't move!

611
00:45:01,067 --> 00:45:03,467
Don't move an inch.

612
00:45:03,467 --> 00:45:06,933
No. 107. No. 107!

613
00:45:08,167 --> 00:45:10,967
- Oh, he's over there! 
 - Excuse us.

614
00:45:11,900 --> 00:45:15,667
 Come to the main entrance. Right now. 

615
00:45:21,700 --> 00:45:22,833
No!

616
00:45:22,833 --> 00:45:25,410
He's over there! Out of my way!

617
00:45:25,410 --> 00:45:26,370
   ­ 

618
00:45:29,933 --> 00:45:32,267
Please.

619
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:36,460
 ­Oh my gosh! 

620
00:45:44,833 --> 00:45:47,833
Stay calm. You remember me, right?

621
00:45:47,833 --> 00:45:49,900
It's me.

622
00:45:50,833 --> 00:45:54,967
I know it's been very tough for you. Dr. Yeo.

623
00:45:58,067 --> 00:46:00,667
Here you go. You must be hungry.

624
00:46:00,667 --> 00:46:03,300
Eat this and reconsider, okay?

625
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:05,400
Here.

626
00:46:07,067 --> 00:46:11,900
That's right, it's me. We've gone through ups and downs together for the past 100 days.

627
00:46:11,900 --> 00:46:14,633
Here you go. Come on.

628
00:46:17,267 --> 00:46:21,833
Endure it just one more day today, and you'll be completely free.

629
00:46:21,833 --> 00:46:24,300
Eat this and hang on just one more day, okay?

630
00:46:24,300 --> 00:46:27,533
Please. You just need to eat it.

631
00:46:27,533 --> 00:46:30,600
Please eat it.

632
00:46:34,933 --> 00:46:36,767
No. No!

633
00:46:36,767 --> 00:46:39,233
No!

634
00:46:56,300 --> 00:46:59,967
No. It can't be.

635
00:46:59,967 --> 00:47:03,833
Gosh, what's wrong? Did something happen?

636
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:09,800
Gosh.

637
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:12,733
I just washed my car today.

638
00:47:14,100 --> 00:47:17,700
And why didn't you answer my calls? I've been waiting for so long.

639
00:47:17,700 --> 00:47:23,133
Don't you see that he lost his life?

640
00:47:25,435 --> 00:47:29,004
Is that your mouse?

641
00:47:29,600 --> 00:47:33,467
But the mouse ran in front of my car out of nowhere.

642
00:47:33,467 --> 00:47:36,767
It wasn't my fault,

643
00:47:36,767 --> 00:47:40,933
but how much do you want? I'll compensate you.

644
00:47:40,933 --> 00:47:44,600
Gosh, that sucks.

645
00:47:44,600 --> 00:47:47,267
Was he your pet or something?

646
00:47:49,167 --> 00:47:53,033
Just because he's a mouse, do you not consider him a living being?

647
00:47:53,033 --> 00:47:57,133
What? You'll compensate me? You can't put a value on life.

648
00:47:57,133 --> 00:48:01,633
So, how much will you pay me? Do you even know what he means to me?

649
00:48:01,633 --> 00:48:05,733
To you, he may just be a mouse that goes around the sewers, but to me, he's a precious life.

650
00:48:05,733 --> 00:48:09,400
He sacrificed himself for people like you.

651
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:13,867
Have you ever sacrificed yourself for anyone?

652
00:48:13,867 --> 00:48:17,667
Have you ever been a meaningful person to anyone?

653
00:48:21,367 --> 00:48:24,067
Are you saying…

654
00:48:24,067 --> 00:48:29,333
Are you saying, this mouse is worthier than me?

655
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:34,300
But, wait…

656
00:48:36,300 --> 00:48:38,900
You asked me last time.

657
00:48:39,433 --> 00:48:41,400
You want an answer?

658
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:43,600
I wouldn't go if I were her. Why?

659
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:47,000
No matter what you do, you'd be indulging yourself in an inferiority complex and self-pity

660
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:51,533
because you can never escape from memories of the past.

661
00:48:51,533 --> 00:48:54,267
Until the day you die.

662
00:48:57,033 --> 00:48:59,600
Until the day I die?

663
00:49:32,700 --> 00:49:38,167
   

664
00:49:48,067 --> 00:49:51,033
It's almost time. Why aren't they here yet?

665
00:49:57,267 --> 00:49:59,167
Sir.

666
00:49:59,167 --> 00:50:01,933
Where is Kyeong Ju Yeon? What about the mouse?

667
00:50:01,933 --> 00:50:05,933
I'm sorry, sir. Well… The thing is…

668
00:50:17,567 --> 00:50:20,467
Here he is.

669
00:50:23,300 --> 00:50:25,167
This is Mouse No. 107,

670
00:50:25,167 --> 00:50:27,633
the successful subject mouse.

671
00:50:27,633 --> 00:50:32,133
Unfortunately, he passed away 30 minutes ago.

672
00:50:32,133 --> 00:50:35,833
But because we were able to erase all the bad memories he had,

673
00:50:35,833 --> 00:50:39,600
I want to take comfort in believing that he passed away with only good memories.

674
00:50:39,600 --> 00:50:43,733
I have no doubt that you've understood the research result

675
00:50:43,733 --> 00:50:45,967
based on images and graphs.

676
00:50:45,967 --> 00:50:48,800
He sacrificed himself for the sake of humanity's happy future.

677
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:52,000
Please don't let his death be in vain

678
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:53,867
and give us one more chance.

679
00:50:53,867 --> 00:50:58,733
100 days from now, I'll demonstrate to you with Subject No. 108.

680
00:51:01,410 --> 00:51:02,740
  ­ 

681
00:51:06,067 --> 00:51:07,933
So you mean,

682
00:51:07,933 --> 00:51:10,700
if we approve your budget,

683
00:51:10,700 --> 00:51:13,533
you'll show us Subject Mouse No. 108?

684
00:51:13,533 --> 00:51:16,767
The 108th experiment won't be done on a mouse.

685
00:51:16,767 --> 00:51:22,500
If you'd allow it, I'd like to show it through human subject research.

686
00:51:25,500 --> 00:51:27,867
Human subject research?

687
00:51:31,633 --> 00:51:33,733
Who's the subject?

688
00:51:43,733 --> 00:51:45,700
Here you go.

689
00:51:45,700 --> 00:51:48,067
Can I get an autograph too?

690
00:51:48,890 --> 00:51:51,040
 Thank you!­ 

691
00:51:51,780 --> 00:51:54,650
 Thank you!­ 

692
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,267
 I wouldn't go if I were her. Why? 

693
00:52:04,267 --> 00:52:07,633
 No matter what you do, you'd be indulging yourself in an inferiority complex and self-pity 

694
00:52:07,633 --> 00:52:12,333
 because you can never escape from memories of the past. 

695
00:52:12,333 --> 00:52:14,967
 Until the day you die. 

696
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,590
 You're so handsome! 

697
00:52:21,590 --> 00:52:23,867
Where are you going? Brother!

698
00:52:40,600 --> 00:52:41,633
   

699
00:52:41,633 --> 00:52:46,333
Bad memories that one can't forget lead to more bad memories being created.

700
00:52:46,333 --> 00:52:48,400
Hey, Kun. Where are you going?

701
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:50,200
Aren't you going to eat before you go?

702
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:53,233
Hey, Kun. Take your medicine at least.

703
00:53:00,700 --> 00:53:05,967
 The memories one creates on his or her own thinking that he or she is unlovable. 

704
00:53:07,700 --> 00:53:10,667
Si On, let's get ready.

705
00:53:10,667 --> 00:53:15,167
 Bitter memories that don't seem like they would matter to anyone. 

706
00:53:15,167 --> 00:53:16,800
By the way,

707
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:19,867
I'm not renewing my contract with this agency.

708
00:53:19,867 --> 00:53:23,067
I can't let you mooch off me, either.

709
00:53:23,067 --> 00:53:27,700
 Even false memories that seem like you're the only one making sacrifices. 

710
00:53:45,233 --> 00:53:49,133
They're stuck in the past, so it no longer becomes the past.

711
00:53:49,133 --> 00:53:52,167
We'll be erasing their painful memories instead of offering ineffective consolation.

712
00:53:52,167 --> 00:53:55,380
Would that be unethical and immoral?

713
00:53:55,380 --> 00:53:56,830
   

714
00:53:57,733 --> 00:54:02,833
I sincerely ask that you don't take away the opportunity someone may need desperately.

715
00:54:33,533 --> 00:54:35,667
 No! 

716
00:54:48,220 --> 00:54:49,400
 ­  

717
00:55:07,300 --> 00:55:08,767
- What happened? 
 - What happened?

718
00:55:08,767 --> 00:55:10,667
He fell from a bridge into the river.

719
00:55:10,667 --> 00:55:12,467
I suspect skull damage due to impact.

720
00:55:12,467 --> 00:55:15,033
He had a cardiac arrest ten minutes ago and was administered CPR.

721
00:55:15,033 --> 00:55:17,500
- Please prepare the operating room. 
 - Yes, doctor.

722
00:55:21,533 --> 00:55:25,533
Shin, are you okay?

723
00:55:26,733 --> 00:55:30,733
Professor, please help.

724
00:55:41,100 --> 00:55:44,033
Don't worry too much.

725
00:56:03,733 --> 00:56:07,100
 No matter what you do, you'd be indulging yourself in inferiority complex and self-pity 

726
00:56:07,100 --> 00:56:10,333
 because you can never escape from memories of the past. 

727
00:56:10,333 --> 00:56:12,267
 Until the day you die. 

728
00:56:12,267 --> 00:56:16,333
 Is it… because of me? 

729
00:56:18,900 --> 00:56:21,467
What's going on? You can't touch anything.

730
00:56:21,467 --> 00:56:22,800
If you can't bear to watch, go outside.

731
00:56:22,800 --> 00:56:26,533
No, it's okay. I'd like to watch.

732
00:56:27,967 --> 00:56:30,367
I'll make an incision here now.

733
00:56:30,367 --> 00:56:32,467
Okay.

734
00:56:33,500 --> 00:56:36,700
Calmly and slowly.

735
00:56:52,033 --> 00:56:54,167
 No! 

736
00:56:57,600 --> 00:57:01,733
 Mom, take me too! 

737
00:57:03,867 --> 00:57:05,867
 I'm sorry. 

738
00:57:08,300 --> 00:57:12,233
 You can never escape from memories of the past. 

739
00:57:12,233 --> 00:57:14,733
 Until the day you die. 

740
00:57:41,333 --> 00:57:43,167
 Are you okay? 

741
00:57:43,167 --> 00:57:45,300
 Open your eyes. 

742
00:57:47,333 --> 00:57:49,467
 Are you okay? 

743
00:59:13,120 --> 00:59:19,550


744
00:59:25,133 --> 00:59:26,800
You, no…

745
00:59:26,800 --> 00:59:29,033
Mr. Lee Kun?

746
00:59:29,900 --> 00:59:31,300
You woke up?

747
00:59:31,300 --> 00:59:34,933
Do you know where this is?

748
00:59:38,967 --> 00:59:42,233
Mr. Lee, do you remember anything?

749
00:59:42,233 --> 00:59:44,900
Do you remember why you are here?

750
00:59:51,300 --> 00:59:55,633
Do you remember who I am?

751
00:59:55,633 --> 00:59:58,167
Do you recognize me?

752
01:00:01,333 --> 01:00:05,067
Who do you think I am?

753
01:00:15,060 --> 01:00:17,400
Finally…

754
01:00:22,867 --> 01:00:25,400
Finally, we meet.

755
01:00:26,710 --> 01:00:31,030
♫  So high  ♫

756
01:00:31,030 --> 01:00:34,400
♫  Look at me, look at me, look at me  ♫

757
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:39,700
♫  So high, look at me  ♫

758
01:00:39,700 --> 01:00:41,500
Hello?

759
01:00:41,500 --> 01:00:42,833
My first love!

760
01:00:42,833 --> 01:00:46,800
♫  Only to me  ♫

761
01:00:46,800 --> 01:00:50,150
♫  Can you please come to me?  ♫

762
01:00:50,150 --> 01:00:54,633
♫  So high  ♫

763
01:00:54,633 --> 01:00:58,633
♫  Look at me, look at me, look at you  ♫

764
01:00:58,633 --> 01:01:02,533
♫  Like today, if I can walk a path  ♫

765
01:01:02,533 --> 01:01:06,467
♫  Along with you  ♫

766
01:01:06,467 --> 01:01:10,367
♫  Like tomorrow, if I can  ♫

767
01:01:10,367 --> 01:01:13,867
    
 ♫  Always see you  ♫

768
01:01:13,867 --> 01:01:15,000
    
 ♫  So high  ♫

769
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:16,567
 I'm his first love? 

770
01:01:16,567 --> 01:01:17,867
 I must have heard it wrong, right? 

771
01:01:17,867 --> 01:01:20,367
 What if I didn't hear it wrong? Are there any side effects? 

772
01:01:20,367 --> 01:01:22,900
 I am that handsome, tall, and sexy Lee Kun. 

773
01:01:22,900 --> 01:01:24,567
 I think you were looking for me unofficially. 

774
01:01:24,567 --> 01:01:26,700
 I'm your doctor, not your first love. 

775
01:01:26,700 --> 01:01:28,433
 You still don't remember me? 

776
01:01:28,433 --> 01:01:30,400
 Ju Yeon, it's an emergency. The subject has escaped. 

777
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:32,600
 Did I fall down those stairs and have an accident? 

778
01:01:32,600 --> 01:01:34,767
 Do you remember? When is your last memory? 

779
01:01:34,767 --> 01:01:37,500
 The subject must never be aware of 

780
01:01:37,500 --> 01:01:40,100
 the experiment or of his past. 

781
01:01:40,100 --> 01:01:42,467
 Are you feeling bad? Mister! 

782
01:01:42,467 --> 01:01:44,967
 An error occurred during the clinical trial? 

783
01:01:44,967 --> 01:01:48,100
 What have you done to me?
