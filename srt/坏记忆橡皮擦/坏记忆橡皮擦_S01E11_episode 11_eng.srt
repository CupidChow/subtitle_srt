 ­  

2
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:14,540
 ­  

3
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:18,370
   

4
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:22,960
   

5
00:00:25,433 --> 00:00:33,300
   

6
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:39,367
   

7
00:00:39,967 --> 00:00:42,000
That's a lie.

8
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:47,367
Look into my eyes and say it.

9
00:00:47,367 --> 00:00:48,633
If that's the truth,

10
00:00:48,633 --> 00:00:51,400
look into my eyes and say it clearly.

11
00:01:00,733 --> 00:01:03,467
You are such a fool.

12
00:01:05,133 --> 00:01:07,267
Even if you lie to me,

13
00:01:08,233 --> 00:01:10,700
don't lie to yourself.

14
00:01:12,467 --> 00:01:14,880
Let's stop pretending...

15
00:01:15,567 --> 00:01:17,800
that we're okay.

16
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:28,840


17
00:01:38,867 --> 00:01:43,067
What are you doing stopping the car in the middle of the bridge?

18
00:01:43,067 --> 00:01:45,633
Other cars can't get through.

19
00:01:45,633 --> 00:01:48,833
Especially in this cold weather.

20
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:52,400
Hurry up and move the car.

21
00:02:01,667 --> 00:02:04,833
It's already getting dark. It must be because it's the countryside.

22
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:07,090
There isn't a single light around.

23
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,867
Yeah, that's true.

24
00:02:08,867 --> 00:02:12,567
Not a single person passing by, nor a dog in sight.

25
00:02:12,567 --> 00:02:16,000
Anything that happens here, no one would know.

26
00:02:16,667 --> 00:02:18,333
Right.

27
00:02:18,333 --> 00:02:20,800
Is there something you want to do now?

28
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,933
When did I ever say that I wanted to do something?

29
00:02:22,933 --> 00:02:25,900
What do you expect? You really have a sneaky side.

30
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:27,367
What on earth…

31
00:02:27,367 --> 00:02:32,433
What did you imagine that makes you think I'm sneaky?

32
00:02:33,833 --> 00:02:36,700
Ugh, I'm so sleepy and tired. Let's head to the accommodation quickly.

33
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:38,800
All right.

34
00:02:40,967 --> 00:02:42,233
I mean, what…

35
00:02:42,233 --> 00:02:44,567
What did you imagine?

36
00:02:44,567 --> 00:02:47,300
Oh, I'm sleepy.

37
00:03:09,733 --> 00:03:11,900
Is this our accommodation?

38
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:14,267
This is my grandmother's house.

39
00:03:15,133 --> 00:03:16,467
Just a moment.

40
00:03:16,467 --> 00:03:21,333
If it's his grandmother's house, isn't it a bad memory for him?

41
00:03:27,933 --> 00:03:29,733
I transferred to a school here.

42
00:03:29,733 --> 00:03:33,700
Not that I really remember much.

43
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:38,900
And my grandmother isn't here anymore, but I really wanted to visit.

44
00:03:41,133 --> 00:03:44,200
Then, your grandmother is…

45
00:03:46,833 --> 00:03:48,867
My grandmother is…

46
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:53,900
It seems like I brought up something unnecessary.

47
00:04:00,033 --> 00:04:03,567
She's in Hawaii at my eldest uncle's place.

48
00:04:03,567 --> 00:04:06,833
Are you trying to tease me on purpose?

49
00:04:06,833 --> 00:04:08,630
What did you say?

50
00:04:09,433 --> 00:04:11,033
Why?

51
00:04:11,033 --> 00:04:14,433
Is my grandmother not supposed to be alive?

52
00:04:14,433 --> 00:04:15,833
No, no.

53
00:04:15,833 --> 00:04:17,633
That…

54
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:23,833
Cute, you are so cute.

55
00:04:23,833 --> 00:04:28,520
It's really fun to tease you.

56
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:30,660
♫  Some words made you change  ♫

57
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:34,133
By the way, are you not hungry? Shall we eat something?

58
00:04:34,133 --> 00:04:37,367
Right, let's see if there's anything edible in Shin's suitcase.

59
00:04:37,367 --> 00:04:38,433
Oh, yes.

60
00:04:38,433 --> 00:04:44,100
♫  I can't help it, restless and lost for words  ♫

61
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:49,300
♫  This moment is embarrassing  ♫

62
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:54,500
♫  No words can express this feeling  ♫

63
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:59,533
♫  I don't really want to say it  ♫

64
00:04:59,533 --> 00:05:04,133
♫  Even without words, my feelings now  ♫

65
00:05:04,133 --> 00:05:05,533
Try it first.

66
00:05:05,533 --> 00:05:08,800
No, please go ahead and eat. I'm not a fan of instant food…

67
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,400
And I definitely don't eat meat that's been in water.

68
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,467
So, please go ahead and eat.

69
00:05:13,467 --> 00:05:15,460
Come on, just try it once.

70
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:19,000
♫  We only know unsophisticated words  ♫

71
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,680
Right.

72
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:24,100
♫  But I know everything, you like me a lot  ♫

73
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:26,467
It's tasty, right?

74
00:05:27,467 --> 00:05:29,333
What is this?

75
00:05:29,333 --> 00:05:32,867
It must taste even better because you fed me.

76
00:05:32,867 --> 00:05:35,633
After my hospital appointments, I spent so much time staying up all night in the lab

77
00:05:35,633 --> 00:05:38,933
that I ended up eating convenience store food almost constantly.

78
00:05:38,933 --> 00:05:41,833
But putting aside the hospital appointments,

79
00:05:41,833 --> 00:05:45,467
is the research really that important?

80
00:05:45,467 --> 00:05:47,700
I became a doctor because of that.

81
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:51,100
My long-time dream is to cure mental illness

82
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:53,133
through brain research.

83
00:05:53,133 --> 00:05:54,967
Then,

84
00:05:55,933 --> 00:05:58,667
that bracelet is also…

85
00:05:59,667 --> 00:06:02,067
My wish bracelet.

86
00:06:02,067 --> 00:06:04,333
That's my wish, too.

87
00:06:04,333 --> 00:06:09,500
Making my subjects happy through my research.

88
00:06:12,333 --> 00:06:17,600
Stop worrying about others, and take care of yourself first.

89
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,233
But I'm more worried about you.

90
00:06:31,267 --> 00:06:33,933
I'm thirsty.

91
00:06:39,667 --> 00:06:41,133
What's that?

92
00:06:41,133 --> 00:06:45,700
There was some tea. I think it was burdock tea.

93
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:48,633
I'll drink this. It's really delicious.

94
00:06:48,633 --> 00:06:49,633
Please drink it.

95
00:06:49,633 --> 00:06:51,100
You are also good at cooking…

96
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:54,700
I boiled it by hand with barrenwort that I picked myself.

97
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:56,967
Didn't CEO Hong give it to you?

98
00:06:56,967 --> 00:06:59,367
Ah, I must have left it in the car.

99
00:06:59,367 --> 00:07:01,833
You left something that valuable in the car?

100
00:07:01,833 --> 00:07:03,567
Go get it right now…

101
00:07:03,567 --> 00:07:05,367
Never mind.

102
00:07:05,367 --> 00:07:08,300
Just leave it and fetch it in the morning.

103
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:11,533
You must never drink that at night.

104
00:07:11,533 --> 00:07:13,600
Why is that?

105
00:07:14,533 --> 00:07:16,633
Well, that's because if you drink that,

106
00:07:16,633 --> 00:07:19,800
your stamina will be boosted!

107
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,400
- Oh my. 
 - Honey!

108
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,667
Ah, why?

109
00:07:22,667 --> 00:07:24,867
What are you saying to Shin now?

110
00:07:24,867 --> 00:07:28,167
He's now in the Athletes' Village, so he shouldn't cause any trouble.

111
00:07:28,167 --> 00:07:29,667
Jeez.

112
00:07:29,667 --> 00:07:31,667
Oh dear.

113
00:07:31,667 --> 00:07:32,667
What is Cola doing?

114
00:07:32,667 --> 00:07:35,133
By the way, Cola doesn't move much

115
00:07:35,133 --> 00:07:37,100
because he misses you so much.

116
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:39,200
 Cola. 

117
00:07:40,333 --> 00:07:41,733
Here, Cola.

118
00:07:41,733 --> 00:07:44,100
- Cola. 
  - Come on, say hi. Look at your brother. 

119
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:45,700
 Hello? 

120
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:48,033
- Cola. 
  - Hello. 

121
00:07:48,033 --> 00:07:49,633
 How is it? 

122
00:07:49,633 --> 00:07:52,200
- Cola. 
  - Brother, hello. 

123
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,467
Hello, sir.

124
00:07:54,467 --> 00:07:56,633
Dad, I have to get up early tomorrow, so I'm hanging up.

125
00:07:56,633 --> 00:07:57,633
- Yeah. 
 - I'll hang up.

126
00:07:57,633 --> 00:08:01,100
All right, for the final farewell. Goodbye!

127
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:04,600
Cola, goodbye. I'll call again.

128
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,100
Yeah, let's go to bed early.

129
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:09,600
If you want to look good on screen at tomorrow's media day.

130
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,767
Oh, wait.

131
00:08:10,767 --> 00:08:13,300
Face mask, face mask!

132
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:18,133
It's the start of life in the Athletes' Village.

133
00:08:18,133 --> 00:08:21,000
How am I supposed to...

134
00:08:22,367 --> 00:08:25,900
endure a month?

135
00:08:27,833 --> 00:08:33,900
   

136
00:08:47,133 --> 00:08:49,700
Ugh, it's hot.

137
00:08:50,733 --> 00:08:53,433
Why is it so hot?

138
00:08:53,433 --> 00:08:55,500
It's strange.

139
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:58,667
I feel like I'm running a fever.

140
00:08:59,467 --> 00:09:02,200
But the floor is cold.

141
00:09:12,733 --> 00:09:15,700
Ugh, it's hot.

142
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:18,400
It's too hot.

143
00:09:19,533 --> 00:09:21,200
Let's go to sleep quickly.

144
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,367
Let's sleep.

145
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,667
 What am I thinking? Like an amateur. 

146
00:09:30,667 --> 00:09:32,900
 Why do I keep thinking about it? 

147
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:35,700
 Forget it! Forget it! 

148
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:39,633
 Let's think about something else. 

149
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,833
 I think I'm losing my mind. 

150
00:09:58,833 --> 00:09:59,900
 What's with this place? 

151
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:02,167
 Am I possessed by a ghost or something? 

152
00:10:02,167 --> 00:10:04,133
 Buddha, God, all the deities of the world. 

153
00:10:04,133 --> 00:10:08,933
 Please save me from the lewd demon. Please, please! 

154
00:10:18,267 --> 00:10:20,933
 Come here. Come here 

155
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:24,533
 Kyeong Ju Yeon, come this way. 

156
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:30,200
 Kyeong Ju Yeon! Kyeong Ju Yeon! 

157
00:10:31,233 --> 00:10:32,300
 Why, why, why? 

158
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:34,667
 Why are even my dreams about kissing? 

159
00:10:34,667 --> 00:10:37,933
 Are you going to keep doing this over a single kiss, huh? 

160
00:10:42,133 --> 00:10:44,567
 Overcome it with willpower. Okay? 

161
00:10:44,567 --> 00:10:47,867
 I'm more rational than anyone else. 

162
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:54,033
It's hot. It's really hot.

163
00:10:57,767 --> 00:10:59,067
It's hot.

164
00:10:59,067 --> 00:11:02,367
 Why? Is it hot? 

165
00:11:04,267 --> 00:11:06,933
It feels a bit hot since the sleeping place has changed.

166
00:11:06,933 --> 00:11:09,367
Don't worry about me, just go to sleep.

167
00:11:09,367 --> 00:11:14,200
 Do you feel stuffy and feverish? 

168
00:11:15,933 --> 00:11:18,033
Then why don't we…

169
00:11:26,433 --> 00:11:29,900
If it's okay, why don't we…

170
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:32,700
Oh my, why are you acting so ill-mannered?

171
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:34,633
Mr. Lee, were you this kind of person?

172
00:11:34,633 --> 00:11:36,633
As responsible adults,

173
00:11:36,633 --> 00:11:39,933
we should act rationally.

174
00:11:42,067 --> 00:11:44,933
No, let's change blankets.

175
00:11:44,933 --> 00:11:48,033
I tend to get cold easily.

176
00:11:48,033 --> 00:11:50,367
I'm already struggling because of the fever.

177
00:11:50,367 --> 00:11:51,900
Are you feeling feverish? Maybe…

178
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:54,167
- Do you have a fever? 
 - Oh my.

179
00:11:54,167 --> 00:11:57,667
Don't even think about sneaking in some skinship.

180
00:12:10,433 --> 00:12:13,733
A mouse… I think there's a mouse.

181
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:15,567
- Mouse? 
 - A mouse?

182
00:12:15,567 --> 00:12:18,333
There's a mouse back there.

183
00:12:18,333 --> 00:12:20,667
Are you acting like this because you're scared?

184
00:12:20,667 --> 00:12:23,633
This is really unbelievable.

185
00:12:23,633 --> 00:12:27,533
I've been living with lab rats for six years now.

186
00:12:27,533 --> 00:12:29,233
- Where is it? 
 - There's not just one or two.

187
00:12:29,233 --> 00:12:31,000
Something… It's here.

188
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,467
But leave that mouse alone.

189
00:12:34,467 --> 00:12:36,400
Where did that sound come from? Where is it?

190
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,067
Come out, mouse. Where are you?

191
00:12:38,067 --> 00:12:39,333
Ju Yeon, don't provoke it.

192
00:12:39,333 --> 00:12:41,533
Oh my.

193
00:12:41,533 --> 00:12:43,367
It seems like it's really not just one or two.

194
00:12:43,367 --> 00:12:45,867
Right, the sound is like a dozen. A dozen mice.

195
00:12:45,867 --> 00:12:47,333
Oh no, what should we do?

196
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:48,367
Don't do it, don't.

197
00:12:48,367 --> 00:12:50,333
Let go of this. I need to open it.

198
00:12:50,333 --> 00:12:52,800
It's not opening.

199
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,167
Ju Yeon, don't provoke it too much.

200
00:12:54,167 --> 00:12:57,167
What if it really comes out?

201
00:12:58,933 --> 00:13:01,100
Mouse! Mouse!

202
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,800
Oh my, what happened?

203
00:13:19,067 --> 00:13:22,167
Did Ju Yeon arrive safely?

204
00:13:28,967 --> 00:13:30,333
Are you asleep?

205
00:13:30,333 --> 00:13:33,467
Yes, I'm asleep.

206
00:13:38,933 --> 00:13:41,200
Do you like the hotel?

207
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:44,033
I really like the hotel.

208
00:13:44,033 --> 00:13:47,333
I really like it.

209
00:13:48,133 --> 00:13:51,033
No, I'm not asking you, hyung.

210
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:57,600
Is she sleeping?

211
00:14:00,633 --> 00:14:02,800
Why isn't she answering?

212
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,400
- Hey. 
 - What?

213
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:07,400
I'm sensitive to noise when I'm sleeping.

214
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:09,867
Could you be a little quieter?

215
00:14:09,867 --> 00:14:12,067
Let's sleep.

216
00:14:17,167 --> 00:14:19,833
You're noisier than I am.

217
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:30,433
Message me when you wake up.

218
00:14:33,567 --> 00:14:36,467
   

219
00:14:36,467 --> 00:14:38,900
It's nice to be outside like this.

220
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:40,600
I remember something about this place.

221
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:43,500
This low wooden bench.

222
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:46,900
On this low wooden bench,

223
00:14:48,933 --> 00:14:52,733
when I would lie down using my grandmother's legs as a pillow,

224
00:14:52,733 --> 00:14:57,500
she couldn't even wake me up while I was sleeping soundly.

225
00:14:59,733 --> 00:15:01,500
She was so worried that I might get bitten by mosquitoes

226
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:05,700
that she stayed up all night, fanning me with her eyes wide open,

227
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:09,140
without getting a moment of sleep.

228
00:15:09,933 --> 00:15:13,033
Try to close your eyes for a moment.

229
00:15:15,567 --> 00:15:19,500
One, two, three.

230
00:15:24,567 --> 00:15:28,067
Now, open your eyes on 'three'.

231
00:15:28,067 --> 00:15:30,633
One.

232
00:15:30,633 --> 00:15:32,733
Two.

233
00:15:32,733 --> 00:15:34,433
Three.

234
00:15:44,167 --> 00:15:46,333
It's so pretty, right?

235
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:54,733
It's so nice.

236
00:16:01,133 --> 00:16:05,467
Even though everything changes, there are things that remain unchanged.

237
00:16:06,567 --> 00:16:07,733
It's cool, right?

238
00:16:07,733 --> 00:16:09,867
You're right.

239
00:16:11,867 --> 00:16:14,000
It's cool.

240
00:16:31,633 --> 00:16:35,400
   

241
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:43,233
My wish was jinxed.

242
00:16:44,833 --> 00:16:48,667
Nothing goes right because of Lee Shin.

243
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:58,133
Why do you dress up so much to go to the cafeteria?

244
00:16:58,133 --> 00:16:59,933
You don't know anything.

245
00:16:59,933 --> 00:17:05,000
The Athletes' Village is where love blossoms in the dining hall and gym.

246
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,500
You don't know how good-looking the swimming team members are. Right?

247
00:17:13,767 --> 00:17:15,467
Let's go.

248
00:17:22,633 --> 00:17:23,733
Hi.

249
00:17:23,733 --> 00:17:26,233
Yeah, eat up.

250
00:17:27,967 --> 00:17:31,500
Judging by the clothes, one would think you're an athlete.

251
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:34,267
Oh? Interpreter, you've come to eat.

252
00:17:34,267 --> 00:17:36,200
- Yes. 
 - Please serve yourself from over there

253
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:39,233
- and sit here. 
 - Yes

254
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Could you please bring me some rice?

255
00:17:47,967 --> 00:17:49,767
It's self-service, self-service.

256
00:17:49,767 --> 00:17:55,667
I'm afraid that the bracelet might snap again, if I move too abruptly.

257
00:17:55,667 --> 00:17:58,233
If you jinx my wish, you should at least do that much for me.

258
00:17:58,233 --> 00:18:00,167
Ah, whatever.

259
00:18:00,167 --> 00:18:02,433
That's just superstition and total nonsense.

260
00:18:02,433 --> 00:18:04,900
If you think a wish will come true just because of a silly bracelet,

261
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:07,967
you should have made a hundred of them. Why didn't you?

262
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,400
Hey, what's wrong with you?

263
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,700
Interpreter.

264
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:17,100
Shin is a bit cranky today since it's the first day of his diet.

265
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:19,533
I will bring it to you.

266
00:18:20,367 --> 00:18:22,833
Wow, you've become quite the food shuttle.

267
00:18:22,833 --> 00:18:24,600
Coach, you have to eat a lot and stay strong.

268
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,000
You're the one who works the hardest.

269
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,733
Oh, our interpreter is truly remarkable.

270
00:18:29,733 --> 00:18:32,233
Even a single word spoken is always so gracious.

271
00:18:32,233 --> 00:18:35,233
By the way, the side dishes here are so good, even beef is included.

272
00:18:35,233 --> 00:18:39,167
Among beef cuts, I prefer the round steak the most.

273
00:18:39,167 --> 00:18:41,433
The butt.

274
00:18:42,067 --> 00:18:44,133
Is that the same for you, Player Lee Shin?

275
00:18:44,133 --> 00:18:48,233
Then, I'll bring it to you.

276
00:18:48,233 --> 00:18:50,267
They've all turned into gentlemen.

277
00:18:50,267 --> 00:18:54,400
Then, should I bring you some beef?

278
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,667
By the way, what should I do? There's no beer here.

279
00:18:56,667 --> 00:19:00,467
Our interpreter here is a real alcoholic.

280
00:19:00,467 --> 00:19:03,433
- An alcoholic? 
 - An alcoholic?

281
00:19:03,433 --> 00:19:04,800
An alcoholic?

282
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:07,333
Ah, well, I do like to drink.

283
00:19:07,333 --> 00:19:11,200
Coach, have you tried that? Snake liquor!

284
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:14,200
Snake liquor is a bit…

285
00:19:18,367 --> 00:19:21,967
Dietitian, please give me some beef.

286
00:19:21,967 --> 00:19:24,367
Is this an Athletes' Village or a lovers' village?

287
00:19:24,367 --> 00:19:27,167
You must like alcohol.

288
00:19:42,067 --> 00:19:43,600
 Why, why? 

289
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:46,033
 Why am I sleeping here? 

290
00:19:48,867 --> 00:19:51,467
 The sleeping face is also white. 

291
00:19:51,467 --> 00:19:55,267
 Can a man's bare face be this pretty? 

292
00:20:01,067 --> 00:20:04,433
 Oh my, isn't my face oily? 

293
00:21:17,267 --> 00:21:23,167
♫  Some word made you change  ♫

294
00:21:23,167 --> 00:21:25,000
Get a grip!

295
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,400
Ah, this won't do.

296
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:32,933
♫  I can't help it, restless and lost for words  ♫

297
00:21:32,933 --> 00:21:38,200
♫  This moment is embarrassing  ♫

298
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:43,400
♫  No words can express it  ♫

299
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:48,333
♫  I don't really want to say it  ♫

300
00:21:48,333 --> 00:21:52,967
♫  Even without words, my feelings now  ♫

301
00:21:52,967 --> 00:21:56,100
It's just a mirror, nothing more to see.

302
00:21:58,167 --> 00:22:00,567
Ta-da!

303
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:04,833
There were wildflowers in the yard.

304
00:22:06,467 --> 00:22:10,267
In the end, flowers just wither.

305
00:22:10,267 --> 00:22:13,267
But they might be worth looking at when dried.

306
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:24,533
   

307
00:22:24,533 --> 00:22:27,000
 No matter how much I look, I haven't missed anything. 

308
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,067
 What could the side effects be? 

309
00:22:29,067 --> 00:22:32,600
 I need to figure that out to take over the research. 

310
00:22:37,367 --> 00:22:39,933
Um, aren't you all going to eat?

311
00:22:39,933 --> 00:22:43,300
I need to prepare the sterile room mice's meal in 10 minutes.

312
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:45,967
Otherwise, I'll get scolded by Dr. Kyeong.

313
00:22:45,967 --> 00:22:48,233
I'll take care of that, so please go ahead.

314
00:22:48,233 --> 00:22:50,300
Really?

315
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:54,000
Then, shall we go to the new soy sauce crab restaurant nearby?

316
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,267
That's expensive.

317
00:22:55,267 --> 00:22:58,900
I think I'll just eat a triangular kimbap here.

318
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:00,367
Well.

319
00:23:00,367 --> 00:23:02,900
I'll treat you.

320
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:04,233
Please go and come back.

321
00:23:04,233 --> 00:23:05,967
Awesome.

322
00:23:05,967 --> 00:23:07,800
Thank you.

323
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:10,533
- What should I do with all this gratitude? 
 - Oh, it's nothing.

324
00:23:10,533 --> 00:23:12,933
Please go and come back.

325
00:23:17,733 --> 00:23:20,867
What the heck are the side effects?

326
00:23:20,867 --> 00:23:24,600
There must be some secretly stashed documents somewhere.

327
00:23:34,433 --> 00:23:36,533
Oh my, what are you doing here?

328
00:23:36,533 --> 00:23:39,600
Ah, I lent a book to Professor Han.

329
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:42,333
Ah, here it is.

330
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:44,633
Yes.

331
00:23:44,633 --> 00:23:46,933
How have you been?

332
00:23:46,933 --> 00:23:50,200
Professor Han has gone to eat now.

333
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:52,600
Yes.

334
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:55,767
Dr. Kim, are you coming back from the U.K. already?

335
00:23:55,767 --> 00:23:57,600
The thesis?

336
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:00,967
Yes, just a moment.

337
00:24:02,633 --> 00:24:04,667
Yes, I'll pass it on.

338
00:24:04,667 --> 00:24:09,800
   

339
00:24:12,167 --> 00:24:13,867
Dr. Kim from the Seoul Brain Center?

340
00:24:13,867 --> 00:24:20,467
Yes, I heard he went on a business trip for a joint research project with Professor Han.

341
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
Oh right. I heard that too.

342
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:26,300
He's already coming back because of that research project.

343
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:29,967
Oh, he was so worried about that. I wonder if he achieved any results.

344
00:24:29,967 --> 00:24:33,633
   

345
00:24:42,933 --> 00:24:45,100
Oh, wait a second.

346
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:47,567
You've got something here.

347
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:51,833
Sis!

348
00:24:52,367 --> 00:24:54,633
- Sis! 
 - Oh, Sae Yan.

349
00:24:54,633 --> 00:24:56,567
Why are you only here now? You should have come earlier.

350
00:24:56,567 --> 00:24:58,000
Did you have breakfast at the hotel?

351
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,900
Yes.

352
00:25:02,333 --> 00:25:03,433
What's going on?

353
00:25:03,433 --> 00:25:05,900
Why do you look so pretty today?

354
00:25:07,033 --> 00:25:09,767
What happened overnight to make you so pretty?

355
00:25:09,767 --> 00:25:12,200
You're even blushing.

356
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:15,733
Ah, this… Maybe it's because I did my makeup in a dark place.

357
00:25:15,733 --> 00:25:18,133
She looks incredibly pretty today. Right?

358
00:25:18,133 --> 00:25:22,000
What? You look great today too, Mr. Lee.

359
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,833
I mean, you are…

360
00:25:23,833 --> 00:25:24,900
The perfume smell is too strong.

361
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:28,200
This is originally the scent that comes from my body.

362
00:25:31,267 --> 00:25:32,833
Are the two of you…

363
00:25:32,833 --> 00:25:35,267
Did you…

364
00:25:39,667 --> 00:25:43,100
So, did you dress up for media day today? To look good on camera.

365
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:45,267
Jeez.

366
00:25:45,267 --> 00:25:50,867
Anyway, it's nice to see the two people I like together at once. Let's go.

367
00:25:50,867 --> 00:25:53,100
Do you know how much I've been wanting to see you all day?

368
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:56,920
I don't know anyone here.

369
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,720
The real first love...

370
00:26:05,567 --> 00:26:08,133
and the fake first love...

371
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:12,900
are both with him.

372
00:26:26,533 --> 00:26:29,333
First of all, it's an honor to have become a national representative.

373
00:26:29,333 --> 00:26:31,800
Although I don't have much experience in doubles matches,

374
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:36,433
I'll work hard not to disappoint the fans.

375
00:26:36,433 --> 00:26:39,000
Where is Player Lee Shin…

376
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:43,433
I will take the interview on his behalf. I also eat rice for two people.

377
00:26:43,433 --> 00:26:44,500
Understood.

378
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:48,067
You moved to a new agency recently. Is there a reason for your choice?

379
00:26:48,067 --> 00:26:50,667
It's because the CEO is handsome.

380
00:26:51,867 --> 00:26:53,467
I'm just kidding.

381
00:26:53,467 --> 00:26:55,733
I had faith in it being a good agency.

382
00:26:55,733 --> 00:26:59,300
I plan to be more active as an athlete.

383
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:02,200
As Senior Lee Shin has a lot of international competition experience,

384
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:06,133
I'll try to follow him well and achieve good results in the competitions.

385
00:27:06,133 --> 00:27:08,267
Thank you.

386
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:11,100
Coach, please say a word as well.

387
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:13,800
- They ask you to say something. 
 - Understood.

388
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:18,633
In the Athletes' Village, the national representatives

389
00:27:18,633 --> 00:27:20,633
will compete in good faith

390
00:27:20,633 --> 00:27:22,767
to determine their qualification for international events.

391
00:27:22,767 --> 00:27:25,933
Through thorough analysis and big data,

392
00:27:25,933 --> 00:27:28,200
we'll maximize the players' potential abilities

393
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:31,367
to the fullest extent.

394
00:27:31,367 --> 00:27:35,133
In the Athletes' Village, the national representatives will compete in good faith

395
00:27:35,133 --> 00:27:37,700
to determine their qualification for international events.

396
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:40,733
No, you know I have interview anxiety.

397
00:27:40,733 --> 00:27:41,733
Hey.

398
00:27:41,733 --> 00:27:43,433
You know the rookie player our agency is fostering. Right?

399
00:27:43,433 --> 00:27:47,500
If you do a solo interview, they say he can be the cover model next time.

400
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:49,633
Meaning, there's an offer for an ad coming in.

401
00:27:49,633 --> 00:27:51,860
I won't do it, I won't.

402
00:27:52,533 --> 00:27:55,333
Lee Shin, are you really going to be like this?

403
00:28:00,467 --> 00:28:03,333
- Thank you. 
 - Thank you for your efforts.

404
00:28:03,333 --> 00:28:05,367
Good work.

405
00:28:05,367 --> 00:28:07,067
Ciao!

406
00:28:07,067 --> 00:28:08,333
- Good work. 
 - Let's go.

407
00:28:08,333 --> 00:28:10,333
Ciao!

408
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:14,670
 ­  

409
00:28:18,967 --> 00:28:21,400
Mom.

410
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:23,600
Pack your things right now.

411
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:26,200
No, there's no need to pack. Just bring your passport.

412
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:28,700
I'll ask Ju Yeon's mom to mail your luggage.

413
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:32,833
Mom, I'm sorry I ran away, but…

414
00:28:32,833 --> 00:28:36,833
Look at this, I became an interpreter for the South Korean national team.

415
00:28:36,833 --> 00:28:38,467
The coach also said I did an excellent job.

416
00:28:38,467 --> 00:28:40,100
People have also been very nice to me.

417
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:42,133
And if I do well at interpreting,

418
00:28:42,133 --> 00:28:44,133
I might even appear on TV like a career woman.

419
00:28:44,133 --> 00:28:46,000
Stop it.

420
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,867
Mr. Lee.

421
00:28:53,867 --> 00:28:55,567
I'm sorry.

422
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:58,500
Our agency deals with sponsorships

423
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:00,100
and endorsements, as well as

424
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:02,933
things like financial management, consulting for individual athletes,

425
00:29:02,933 --> 00:29:04,400
and post-retirement care.

426
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:07,600
We are trying to expand our role as advisors.

427
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:11,733
Sports is ultimately a psychological battle, so we manage the mental health of the athletes.

428
00:29:11,733 --> 00:29:14,367
You can't quit because of the interpreting job?

429
00:29:14,367 --> 00:29:17,500
Do you think I don't know what you've been up to?

430
00:29:19,167 --> 00:29:21,933
- That's… 
 - Quit right now.

431
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:26,400
He's just a biological father. That's all.

432
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:28,833
He was nothing but trash.

433
00:29:28,833 --> 00:29:31,300
He never even registered you in his family registry.

434
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:34,167
I have never received a single penny in child support from him.

435
00:29:34,167 --> 00:29:37,667
He's just a person of no significance.

436
00:29:39,133 --> 00:29:40,733
Still,

437
00:29:40,733 --> 00:29:42,767
I want to meet him at least once.

438
00:29:42,767 --> 00:29:45,167
I told you not to talk back.

439
00:29:45,167 --> 00:29:48,200
Don't you ever think about your father now?

440
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:51,100
When we went to Italy penniless and homeless,

441
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:54,100
it was your father who took us in.

442
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:57,933
If it weren't for him, no one would have even glanced at us,

443
00:29:57,933 --> 00:30:01,700
no matter how long we stayed on the streets. Do you understand?

444
00:30:02,767 --> 00:30:06,167
I'm an adult now… And if I start looking for my biological father here—

445
00:30:06,167 --> 00:30:08,360
Who are you calling father?

446
00:30:08,967 --> 00:30:10,900
It's better not to know such a person.

447
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:14,733
And you know what he's like when he gets angry. Right?

448
00:30:14,733 --> 00:30:16,067
Pack your things right now.

449
00:30:16,067 --> 00:30:19,867
If you don't want to see me die, you understand?

450
00:30:24,033 --> 00:30:25,200
Oh my.

451
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:29,633
Are you, by any chance, our interpreter's mother?

452
00:30:31,267 --> 00:30:33,367
Yes.

453
00:30:33,367 --> 00:30:35,900
I apologize for the late introduction.

454
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:39,033
I'm 'Agency Goon's' CEO, Lee Kun.

455
00:30:40,867 --> 00:30:43,933
Ms. Sae Yan is working with our company.

456
00:30:43,933 --> 00:30:47,133
She's contracted with the agency as an interpreter.

457
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:50,733
A contract?

458
00:30:51,767 --> 00:30:54,867
How much is it? I will send it to you within 10 minutes.

459
00:30:54,867 --> 00:30:56,900
We need to leave for Italy real soon.

460
00:30:56,900 --> 00:30:59,000
Then that's it, right?

461
00:30:59,467 --> 00:31:03,133
So Ms. Sae Yan is very rich in Italy.

462
00:31:04,267 --> 00:31:05,533
But what should we do now?

463
00:31:05,533 --> 00:31:08,133
It seems you won't be able to leave the country immediately.

464
00:31:08,133 --> 00:31:13,267
I'm going to sue Ms. Sae Yan for fraud and request a travel ban.

465
00:31:13,267 --> 00:31:14,667
What?

466
00:31:14,667 --> 00:31:17,233
I overheard involuntarily.

467
00:31:17,233 --> 00:31:20,133
Did she enter Korea for a different purpose?

468
00:31:20,133 --> 00:31:22,967
She was given a work visa on the premise that she came to work.

469
00:31:22,967 --> 00:31:26,733
In other words, it's a case of a cover job.

470
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:33,133
A cover job?

471
00:31:33,133 --> 00:31:36,767
Through our agency, she became the interpreter for the national team.

472
00:31:36,767 --> 00:31:40,133
If she just leaves, it's expected to have a significant impact and ripple effect

473
00:31:40,133 --> 00:31:43,467
on our company's trust, so there's nothing we can do about it.

474
00:31:43,467 --> 00:31:46,967
Especially since the work visa was granted to do work for the country.

475
00:31:46,967 --> 00:31:50,200
I will file a complaint through my lawyer

476
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:53,133
within the next 10 minutes.

477
00:31:57,500 --> 00:32:00,133
So were you jealous?

478
00:32:02,033 --> 00:32:05,033
This feeling of jealousy is natural.

479
00:32:05,033 --> 00:32:06,100
Just be jealous.

480
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:09,600
People are appropriately imperfect and appropriately perfect.

481
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:10,700
Really?

482
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:14,433
Of course, natural feelings are the most important.

483
00:32:14,433 --> 00:32:16,200
The same goes for love.

484
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:19,200
If you want to love, don't hesitate even for a moment.

485
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:22,600
If you do it as much as you want and fully, well, eventually…

486
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:24,867
You are dating Mr. Lee, right?

487
00:32:24,867 --> 00:32:28,533
No? It's a misunderstanding, a misunderstanding…

488
00:32:28,533 --> 00:32:31,000
Seeing you react, it seems you do want to date him in your heart.

489
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,667
Be honest with yourself, Doctor.

490
00:32:33,667 --> 00:32:37,467
Even Senior Shin is head over heels for Sae Yan and unable to come to his senses.

491
00:32:37,467 --> 00:32:41,800
I don't know why everyone pretends they don't like each other.

492
00:32:47,467 --> 00:32:48,933
Now I'm dead.

493
00:32:48,933 --> 00:32:51,733
My father won't stay still if he hears about the lawsuit.

494
00:32:51,733 --> 00:32:53,700
He is an incredibly scary person.

495
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:58,300
My dad is in an Italian gang.

496
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:09,167
Gang? What kind of gang?

497
00:33:09,167 --> 00:33:12,400
You don't mean that gang. Right?

498
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:15,833
And it's the biggest…

499
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:18,233
Call your mom now.

500
00:33:18,233 --> 00:33:19,933
Tell your mom that the contract talk earlier was all a lie

501
00:33:19,933 --> 00:33:21,967
and that there was a slight misunderstanding.

502
00:33:21,967 --> 00:33:23,733
- Quickly, quickly… 
 - No, I can't do it.

503
00:33:23,733 --> 00:33:25,267
Then I'll have to go back to Italy.

504
00:33:25,267 --> 00:33:26,633
What does it matter?

505
00:33:26,633 --> 00:33:29,167
Call her right now. I'll do it for you.

506
00:33:29,167 --> 00:33:30,067
There's no other way.

507
00:33:30,067 --> 00:33:32,733
We must find my real father as soon as possible.

508
00:33:32,733 --> 00:33:35,767
I refuse… I don't want to be involved with you anymore.

509
00:33:35,767 --> 00:33:37,800
There's nothing we can do. We're already on the same boat.

510
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:39,200
You will be driving, right?

511
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:41,300
Ah, this is driving me crazy.

512
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:44,433
Why did I get involved with her in the first place?

513
00:34:10,267 --> 00:34:12,567
Player Lee Shin.

514
00:34:15,733 --> 00:34:18,967
Are you undergoing treatment?

515
00:34:18,967 --> 00:34:22,167
You must have been very busy, ignoring my messages.

516
00:34:22,167 --> 00:34:24,700
I'm totally miffed.

517
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:26,833
What did you send?

518
00:34:26,833 --> 00:34:30,667
My phone's battery died.

519
00:34:30,667 --> 00:34:33,600
So it wasn't that you read and ignored it?

520
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:36,767
I was totally freaked out.

521
00:34:36,767 --> 00:34:39,300
I sent something important yesterday.

522
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:43,433
I did an ex-boyfriend cosplay and texted "Are you asleep?"

523
00:34:44,867 --> 00:34:49,267
But you're in rehabilitation treatment, right?

524
00:34:49,267 --> 00:34:53,833
Are you by any chance not doing the interview?

525
00:34:55,033 --> 00:34:58,467
Could it be that CEO Hong asked you to do this?

526
00:34:58,467 --> 00:35:00,700
To persuade me?

527
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:02,967
No, then the reason for coming here is also…

528
00:35:02,967 --> 00:35:04,867
I don't want to lie.

529
00:35:04,867 --> 00:35:09,367
Oh my, he's taking advantage of you.

530
00:35:09,367 --> 00:35:13,500
CEO Hong handles things very well.

531
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:15,933
It's not quite counseling.

532
00:35:15,933 --> 00:35:20,333
Shall we just have a cup of coffee?

533
00:35:23,333 --> 00:35:27,400
Is this like a date or something?

534
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:32,400
The treatment actually has 20 minutes left, but I'll just take 5 minutes.

535
00:35:34,633 --> 00:35:37,133
Don't go anywhere.

536
00:35:43,633 --> 00:35:46,167
No, I have the right to my image.

537
00:35:46,167 --> 00:35:49,467
I'll buy your portrait rights. Smile for me.

538
00:35:49,467 --> 00:35:52,133
Don't do it.

539
00:35:57,067 --> 00:35:59,367
You're good at taking photos like this,

540
00:35:59,367 --> 00:36:02,067
but you don't like standing in front of the camera?

541
00:36:06,267 --> 00:36:08,833
I'm afraid everything will be exposed.

542
00:36:10,733 --> 00:36:13,600
There is no such person as the player Lee Shin.

543
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:16,633
I am just acting as my brother.

544
00:36:16,633 --> 00:36:20,100
"Would my brother have played like this?"

545
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:22,933
"Would my brother have managed like this?"

546
00:36:22,933 --> 00:36:26,067
I've come this far by deceiving people.

547
00:36:26,067 --> 00:36:28,550
But whenever I stand in front of the camera,

548
00:36:29,033 --> 00:36:31,867
it feels like it's about to be exposed

549
00:36:31,867 --> 00:36:35,100
that I'm just an empty shell.

550
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:38,567
It feels like people will recognize it.

551
00:36:39,733 --> 00:36:41,967
That's an impostor.

552
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:44,333
What?

553
00:36:44,333 --> 00:36:47,233
It's called "Impostor Syndrome."

554
00:36:47,233 --> 00:36:51,800
Successful people often think, "I've made it by luck, not by skill,"

555
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:55,033
'"What if I don't meet people's expectations?"

556
00:36:55,033 --> 00:36:57,567
They always feel anxious.

557
00:36:58,533 --> 00:37:01,000
Impostor Syndrome.

558
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,333
What's the cure?

559
00:37:02,333 --> 00:37:03,767
"Acknowledge it.

560
00:37:03,767 --> 00:37:06,267
And be honest with your feelings."

561
00:37:06,267 --> 00:37:08,767
It says so in the theory book.

562
00:37:10,033 --> 00:37:11,800
Does that make it better?

563
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:15,233
No, but you'll get used to it.

564
00:37:15,233 --> 00:37:18,700
You just keep trying until you get used to it.

565
00:37:19,233 --> 00:37:22,000
Getting used to it…

566
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,233
Exercise is just about pushing through with sweat, blood, and tears,

567
00:37:25,233 --> 00:37:28,067
so I just have to endure and get it done.

568
00:37:30,533 --> 00:37:33,467
But this thing never listens to me…

569
00:37:35,233 --> 00:37:38,367
Because you and I are different.

570
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:41,467
How do I seem to you?

571
00:37:41,467 --> 00:37:44,533
Do you think that, because I work in mental health, I don't have any worries

572
00:37:44,533 --> 00:37:50,467
and that work, love, and life will just go smoothly with a bit of mind control?

573
00:37:52,667 --> 00:37:54,600
Not at all.

574
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:57,167
Even I can't have things my way.

575
00:37:57,167 --> 00:38:01,600
I also make up my mind and reaffirm it many times.

576
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:05,400
Even after covering my ears, closing my eyes,

577
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:10,667
and clearing my mind, I find that I end up getting distracted again.

578
00:38:12,867 --> 00:38:15,280
That's the worst for a doctor, isn't it?

579
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:18,310
We both have flaws.

580
00:38:19,167 --> 00:38:21,270
I'll give you a prescription.

581
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:25,920
"Acknowledge it," and "be honest with your feelings."

582
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:29,833
Let's do it together.

583
00:38:29,833 --> 00:38:32,033
To acknowledge and be honest.

584
00:38:36,267 --> 00:38:38,267
By any chance,

585
00:38:38,267 --> 00:38:43,000
your brother's first love hasn't contacted you. Right?

586
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,433
Not at all.

587
00:38:44,433 --> 00:38:46,970
Even the name is becoming vague.

588
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:51,433
Don't worry too much about his first love.

589
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:03,333
   

590
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:11,400
 ­  

591
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:15,880
If I had a talisman from you, I think I could achieve what you mentioned earlier.

592
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,560
Come on.

593
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:24,267
A talisman.

594
00:39:34,567 --> 00:39:35,667
I'm nervous.

595
00:39:35,667 --> 00:39:38,333
Don't go anywhere and wait. Okay?

596
00:39:38,333 --> 00:39:39,667
Oh, Shin.

597
00:39:39,667 --> 00:39:43,000
Shin, it's ready inside. Let's go in.

598
00:39:44,610 --> 00:39:48,050
 ­  

599
00:39:57,133 --> 00:39:59,567
Here's the list of peopl from the youth department.

600
00:39:59,567 --> 00:40:01,900
I barely got it.

601
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:03,767
Then the people who used to live there.

602
00:40:03,767 --> 00:40:05,400
Are they all listed here?

603
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:08,967
Yes, they're all written down because of the youth membership fees.

604
00:40:08,967 --> 00:40:12,100
Well, if the numbers have changed,there's nothing that can be done.

605
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:15,300
This is like looking for a needle in a sandbox.

606
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:17,867
By the way, who is this person?

607
00:40:17,867 --> 00:40:20,133
You look familiar.

608
00:40:20,133 --> 00:40:22,900
He's so good-looking that it feels like you've seen him on TV or somewhere, right?

609
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:25,800
Indeed, I have something of an idol's look, but I…

610
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:29,333
No, I don't watch TV.

611
00:40:29,333 --> 00:40:30,900
Do you possibly not know me?

612
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:33,867
I feel like I've seen you somewhere.

613
00:40:34,633 --> 00:40:39,100
Perhaps with that lady by the water yesterday…

614
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:42,500
Let's hurry. We're running out of time.

615
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:46,300
His grandmother used to live here a long time ago.

616
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:48,433
What's her name?

617
00:40:49,167 --> 00:40:52,833
Her name is Jang Yang Rae.

618
00:40:53,467 --> 00:40:55,533
The elder from the pear tree house?

619
00:40:55,533 --> 00:40:57,500
Lee Shin's grandmother?

620
00:40:57,500 --> 00:40:58,833
Oh my!

621
00:40:58,833 --> 00:41:01,833
Then are you Lee Kun?

622
00:41:01,833 --> 00:41:03,533
Did my grandma talk about me?

623
00:41:03,533 --> 00:41:05,333
Oh my! What are you talking about?

624
00:41:05,333 --> 00:41:08,333
It's me, you know? The persimmon tree house uncle. Don't you recognize me?

625
00:41:08,333 --> 00:41:10,000
I'm not really sure about that.

626
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,267
I lost my memories when I was young.

627
00:41:12,267 --> 00:41:15,033
What's going on?

628
00:41:15,033 --> 00:41:18,433
Anyway, you've grown up so well.

629
00:41:18,433 --> 00:41:23,400
When you were young, you really gave your grandmother a hard time.

630
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:27,100
- Me? 
 - Yes.

631
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:31,100
 Back then, you didn't go to school or speak for a while, 

632
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:34,600
 so your grandmother had a really hard time. 

633
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:36,167
 What was it that people said? 

634
00:41:36,167 --> 00:41:40,067
 They said someone died because of the grandchild. 

635
00:41:46,767 --> 00:41:51,567
Oh my! Mr. Lee, are you all right?

636
00:41:53,867 --> 00:41:56,133
 Try opening your eyes. 

637
00:41:56,133 --> 00:41:58,333
 Are you okay? 

638
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:05,200
 Hey, come out now. 

639
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:07,033
 Come out quickly. 

640
00:42:07,033 --> 00:42:10,300
 Stop joking and come out now. 

641
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:20,633
 Mom, take me with you. 

642
00:42:33,233 --> 00:42:35,467
 Mom. 

643
00:42:37,533 --> 00:42:39,300
No.

644
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:41,600
 My medal! 

645
00:42:42,933 --> 00:42:44,533
No!

646
00:42:44,533 --> 00:42:46,667
Mr. Lee, you mustn't.

647
00:42:46,667 --> 00:42:51,767
Mr. Lee, please don't do this.

648
00:43:00,233 --> 00:43:03,600
Mr. Lee, are you okay?

649
00:43:05,767 --> 00:43:07,933
 Are you all right? 

650
00:43:07,933 --> 00:43:08,833
 Open your eyes. 

651
00:43:08,833 --> 00:43:10,633
 I can't see the face. 

652
00:43:10,633 --> 00:43:12,933
 The face of Ju Yeon. 

653
00:43:12,933 --> 00:43:16,900
 - My medal… 
 - I'll bring it to you. 

654
00:43:23,333 --> 00:43:25,467
 Just come out. 

655
00:43:26,533 --> 00:43:28,867
 Come out now. 

656
00:43:54,267 --> 00:43:58,633
 Let's do it together, acknowledge it and be honest. 

657
00:43:58,633 --> 00:44:02,500
 Accepting my feelings and being honest about it. 

658
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:05,700
 Am I not unqualified? 

659
00:44:05,700 --> 00:44:10,100
 Isn't that not allowed? 

660
00:44:15,590 --> 00:44:17,020
 ­  

661
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,200
Where did Ju Yeon go?

662
00:44:26,700 --> 00:44:28,433
 - The power's off…  
 - Ah, right, right.

663
00:44:28,433 --> 00:44:29,533
She said her phone was turned off.

664
00:44:29,533 --> 00:44:33,500
Hey, have you been interviewing up until now? What's the occasion?

665
00:44:33,500 --> 00:44:35,067
Have you seen Ju Yeon?

666
00:44:35,067 --> 00:44:36,300
- Dr. Kyeong Ju Yeon? 
 - Yes.

667
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:38,033
No, I haven't seen her.

668
00:44:38,033 --> 00:44:40,233
Got it.

669
00:44:40,233 --> 00:44:43,433
Why is he so excited?

670
00:45:17,067 --> 00:45:19,120
Don't go, not anywhere.

671
00:45:19,933 --> 00:45:22,480
Don't disappear in front of me.

672
00:45:23,267 --> 00:45:25,070
You.

673
00:45:25,867 --> 00:45:28,250
I thought you were dead.

674
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:31,690
You said you would bring my medal back to me.

675
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:35,320
Because of me.

676
00:45:36,667 --> 00:45:39,260
I thought you died because of me.

677
00:45:40,367 --> 00:45:42,500
It's enough now.

678
00:45:42,500 --> 00:45:45,930
♫  Don't lose your light yet  ♫

679
00:45:45,933 --> 00:45:47,900
It's enough now that you're in front of me.

680
00:45:47,900 --> 00:45:51,600
♫  You were warmer than anyone else  ♫

681
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:55,700
I was afraid that even your being alive might be an illusion.

682
00:45:55,700 --> 00:45:57,190
I was afraid that it might all be an illusion.

683
00:45:57,190 --> 00:46:02,500
♫  Even if you fall into an abyss  ♫

684
00:46:04,050 --> 00:46:09,600
♫  It's okay  ♫

685
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:12,667
Seeing your face,

686
00:46:12,667 --> 00:46:14,500
it's enough.

687
00:46:14,500 --> 00:46:16,790
Since you're in front of me,

688
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:20,420
it's enough.

689
00:46:21,670 --> 00:46:30,760
♫  That day will be so bright it dazzles your eyes  ♫

690
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:33,367
I'm not going anywhere.

691
00:46:34,833 --> 00:46:36,300
I can't go now.

692
00:46:36,300 --> 00:46:42,333
♫  I will be by your side, as if it's fate  ♫

693
00:46:42,333 --> 00:46:50,500
♫  Even in sleep and in dreams  ♫

694
00:46:50,500 --> 00:46:57,300
♫  I will protect you  ♫

695
00:47:17,467 --> 00:47:20,267
   

696
00:47:26,667 --> 00:47:30,170
Right, Dr. Kyeong said so.

697
00:47:32,700 --> 00:47:36,930
She said that expressing emotions is healthy.

698
00:47:55,733 --> 00:47:59,000
Oh, you're here? Did you have a good consultation with Ju Yeon?

699
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:00,300
- Here it is. 
 - What's this?

700
00:48:00,300 --> 00:48:02,400
Sorry for being so prickly all day today.

701
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:04,900
Thanks, but were you prickly towards me?

702
00:48:04,900 --> 00:48:07,267
I didn't even notice.

703
00:48:10,333 --> 00:48:12,600
Thank you.

704
00:48:15,900 --> 00:48:19,267
Today, the swim team members said they would show me how to do rehab through swimming.

705
00:48:19,267 --> 00:48:21,200
Let's go together.

706
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:23,433
Rehabilitation? What rehabilitation?

707
00:48:23,433 --> 00:48:26,067
I'm not even an athlete, and I'm busy.

708
00:48:26,067 --> 00:48:28,933
I have places I need to call one by one.

709
00:48:32,233 --> 00:48:37,400
So, I can stay out late with the guys today. Right?

710
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:39,433
What?

711
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:05,700
- Sae Yan. 
 - Huh?

712
00:49:05,700 --> 00:49:09,033
The zipper isn't all the way up.

713
00:49:21,167 --> 00:49:23,033
Why? Does your stomach hurt?

714
00:49:23,033 --> 00:49:25,933
Huh? No, that…

715
00:49:27,267 --> 00:49:31,167
I… I need to use the restroom for a moment.

716
00:49:35,733 --> 00:49:38,833
It's not that painful, is it?

717
00:49:43,233 --> 00:49:45,033
How do I do this?

718
00:49:45,033 --> 00:49:47,367
Ah, well…

719
00:49:56,733 --> 00:49:59,000
Si On.

720
00:50:16,367 --> 00:50:18,433
Excuse me.

721
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:30,333
Go.

722
00:50:31,333 --> 00:50:33,333
Ugh, hey, I…

723
00:50:36,967 --> 00:50:39,433
Save me, please.

724
00:50:40,500 --> 00:50:42,500
This zipper…

725
00:50:42,500 --> 00:50:46,667
The zipper isn't going down.

726
00:50:46,667 --> 00:50:51,167
My stomach hurts so much.

727
00:50:52,333 --> 00:50:54,233
Just do it here.

728
00:50:54,233 --> 00:50:56,867
Hey, I…

729
00:50:56,867 --> 00:51:01,300
I'm dying of embarrassment.

730
00:51:20,833 --> 00:51:23,767
Jeez.

731
00:51:23,767 --> 00:51:27,667
How can I live with this embarrassment?

732
00:51:32,233 --> 00:51:35,533
You're the one who said that

733
00:51:35,533 --> 00:51:39,167
expressing emotions, even jealousy, is normal.

734
00:51:39,167 --> 00:51:41,000
I told you to do it in a healthy way.

735
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,833
If you want to cry, cry, and if you want to shout, shout.

736
00:51:43,833 --> 00:51:46,467
This isn't expressing emotions, it's a crime.

737
00:51:46,467 --> 00:51:48,833
Apologize to her, now.

738
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:55,533
I'm sorry.

739
00:51:55,533 --> 00:52:00,390
Well, at least you didn't crap on your clothes, so that's a relief.

740
00:52:19,933 --> 00:52:22,767
I'll give you exactly five minutes, come here.

741
00:52:22,767 --> 00:52:26,300
Really? What's the occasion?

742
00:52:26,300 --> 00:52:28,800
If not, never mind.

743
00:52:34,567 --> 00:52:36,167
Of all people,

744
00:52:36,167 --> 00:52:39,500
I had to embarrass myself in front of Lee Shin.

745
00:52:39,500 --> 00:52:43,067
Why do you always fight when you meet Player Lee Shin?

746
00:52:43,067 --> 00:52:46,600
I don't know. Maybe we were enemies in a past life.

747
00:52:46,600 --> 00:52:49,433
How can he be so different from his brother?

748
00:52:49,433 --> 00:52:52,667
His brother even took me to the countryside and helped me.

749
00:52:52,667 --> 00:52:54,600
With Mr. Lee, in the countryside?

750
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:57,367
Yes, the place I used to live.

751
00:52:57,367 --> 00:53:00,133
Mr. Lee said he lived there for a while when he was a kid with his grandma.

752
00:53:00,133 --> 00:53:02,733
Ah, that place?

753
00:53:02,733 --> 00:53:04,567
Come to think of it, Lee Shin is such a liar.

754
00:53:04,567 --> 00:53:08,267
He insisted he didn't know anyone there, but it turns out he lies every time.

755
00:53:08,267 --> 00:53:10,000
I'm looking for my real dad.

756
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:15,067
But last time he kept saying sorry and claimed he figured out who I was looking for.

757
00:53:15,067 --> 00:53:16,467
Your father?

758
00:53:16,467 --> 00:53:20,333
No? He thought I was looking for some kind of first love.

759
00:53:20,333 --> 00:53:23,367
Out of the blue, what first love?

760
00:53:24,300 --> 00:53:28,767
Crying suddenly makes me sleepy.

761
00:53:30,167 --> 00:53:32,300
So because of that, he…

762
00:53:32,300 --> 00:53:35,333
he tried to get me fired…

763
00:53:36,333 --> 00:53:39,667
Get you fired? Why?

764
00:53:46,133 --> 00:53:51,467
They say a child is the prettiest when asleep. That's just right.

765
00:54:15,300 --> 00:54:19,400
 Do you want to go stargazing? See you in 10 minutes at the entrance. 

766
00:54:22,630 --> 00:54:24,230
  ­ 

767
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:29,067
Hello?

768
00:54:30,067 --> 00:54:32,167
Who is this?

769
00:54:38,848 --> 00:54:39,900
   

770
00:54:39,900 --> 00:54:43,033
You don't remember me, right?

771
00:54:43,033 --> 00:54:46,833
I've heard about you from my mother occasionally.

772
00:54:46,833 --> 00:54:50,400
And I've heard from Sae Yan, too.

773
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:53,333
Then you must not have heard good things.

774
00:54:54,533 --> 00:54:57,633
After meeting Sae Yan and on my way back,

775
00:54:58,800 --> 00:55:02,633
I was wondering if you could help me a bit.

776
00:55:03,567 --> 00:55:05,767
Ever since she was little,

777
00:55:05,767 --> 00:55:10,000
you were the only person Sae Yan ever followed.

778
00:55:11,333 --> 00:55:15,567
She used to sing about visiting Ju Yeon when she grew up.

779
00:55:15,567 --> 00:55:17,500
Maybe,

780
00:55:17,500 --> 00:55:22,800
she liked you more than me?

781
00:55:25,600 --> 00:55:28,867
Please persuade our Sae Yan and send her back.

782
00:55:28,867 --> 00:55:31,367
The sooner, the better.

783
00:55:35,233 --> 00:55:38,133
I'm sorry to say this, but…

784
00:55:38,133 --> 00:55:42,367
Sae Yan actually enjoys what she's doing now.

785
00:55:42,367 --> 00:55:45,500
Perhaps because it's the first time she's trying something on her own,

786
00:55:45,500 --> 00:55:47,733
she's even more diligent.

787
00:55:50,233 --> 00:55:53,200
You're probably wondering why I'm stopping her

788
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:56,167
from meeting her biological father. Right?

789
00:55:56,167 --> 00:55:59,333
You might even doubt if I'm her real mother.

790
00:56:03,233 --> 00:56:06,100
I can't tell you everything,

791
00:56:06,100 --> 00:56:10,367
but it's all for Sae Yan.

792
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:13,767
I'm sorry,

793
00:56:13,767 --> 00:56:17,433
but no matter what the reason is, Sae Yan is a grown adult,

794
00:56:17,433 --> 00:56:18,800
and neither I nor you, ma'am,

795
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:24,400
have the right to stop her life.

796
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:26,700
It's for your sake too.

797
00:56:27,633 --> 00:56:29,800
Me?

798
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:32,400
It would be better to convince her.

799
00:56:33,167 --> 00:56:37,933
I met with the agency CEO earlier,

800
00:56:37,933 --> 00:56:40,167
and that person was also on Sae Yan's side.

801
00:56:40,167 --> 00:56:45,433
Turns out he's Player Lee Shin's brother. So that's why he protected her. Right?

802
00:56:45,433 --> 00:56:47,000
Player Lee Shin?

803
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:51,600
Yesterday, he begged to take Sae Yan away.

804
00:56:51,600 --> 00:56:56,267
If he finds out we are together now, there might really be trouble.

805
00:56:56,267 --> 00:56:59,333
I'm not sure what you mean.

806
00:57:02,733 --> 00:57:05,200
When he came for training in Italy,

807
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:07,267
it seems like the two of them met briefly.

808
00:57:07,267 --> 00:57:09,800
So when her father went to see him,

809
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:11,833
he was like,

810
00:57:11,833 --> 00:57:14,800
"I'm not the type to fall deeply for a woman."

811
00:57:14,800 --> 00:57:17,067
"I just planned to meet a few times."

812
00:57:17,067 --> 00:57:19,233
It was shocking.

813
00:57:21,433 --> 00:57:27,067
So those two knew each other before?

814
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:34,880
 ­  

815
00:57:37,433 --> 00:57:41,900
 You haven't been in touch with your brother's first love. Right? 

816
00:57:41,900 --> 00:57:46,000
 Not at all. I barely remember the name. 

817
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:49,100
 I haven't met her since then. 

818
00:57:49,100 --> 00:57:52,500
 If all that was a fabricated lie… 

819
00:57:52,500 --> 00:57:54,667
 When he came for training in Italy, 

820
00:57:54,667 --> 00:57:56,167
 it seems like the two of them met briefly. 

821
00:57:56,167 --> 00:57:57,967
 Kun saw everything. 

822
00:57:57,967 --> 00:58:02,000
 That day, you and his first love were together. 

823
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,133
 That's right. 

824
00:58:04,133 --> 00:58:07,067
 We kissed in the hotel parking lot that night. 

825
00:58:07,067 --> 00:58:10,233
 This was on the ground. 

826
00:58:10,233 --> 00:58:11,500
 Sis! 

827
00:58:11,500 --> 00:58:13,500
Ta-da.

828
00:58:13,500 --> 00:58:17,500
 So the first love he was with… 

829
00:58:17,500 --> 00:58:21,333
 Mr. Lee said he lived there for a while when he was a kid with his grandma. 

830
00:58:27,933 --> 00:58:30,133
Sae Yan is…

831
00:58:31,600 --> 00:58:36,433
Sae Yan was his real first love.

832
00:59:21,133 --> 00:59:25,033
Player Lee Shin, where are you? Let's meet now.

833
01:00:04,467 --> 01:00:06,867
Speak honestly.

834
01:00:06,867 --> 01:00:09,633
Is it true that you're not in touch with

835
01:00:09,633 --> 01:00:11,667
your brother's first love?

836
01:00:12,467 --> 01:00:14,900
That first love.

837
01:00:14,900 --> 01:00:18,700
It's Jeon Sae Yan. Right?

838
01:00:24,300 --> 01:00:26,367
That's correct.

839
01:00:26,367 --> 01:00:28,333
Jeon Sae Yan.

840
01:00:31,300 --> 01:00:33,833
Why…

841
01:00:33,833 --> 01:00:37,533
Why didn't you tell the truth back then?

842
01:00:37,533 --> 01:00:39,233
Is that important?

843
01:00:39,233 --> 01:00:42,333
If I had mentioned it back then, do you think I could've hidden it in front of Jeon Sae Yan?

844
01:00:42,333 --> 01:00:43,900
You should have told me.

845
01:00:43,900 --> 01:00:45,867
Would anything change?

846
01:00:45,867 --> 01:00:49,067
Back then and now, you are just the first love my brother misunderstood.

847
01:00:49,067 --> 01:00:51,900
Nothing more, nothing less. Right?

848
01:00:53,067 --> 01:00:55,367
Why?

849
01:00:55,367 --> 01:01:00,433
Did you develop feelings for him while pretending to be his first love?

850
01:01:01,633 --> 01:01:03,400
Nothing will change.

851
01:01:03,400 --> 01:01:05,867
Whether the main character is Jeon Sae Yan or not

852
01:01:05,867 --> 01:01:08,433
as long as you are firm.

853
01:01:09,633 --> 01:01:12,867
As you have done so far, Ju Yeon, you just

854
01:01:12,867 --> 01:01:15,367
need to keep pushing him away.

855
01:01:25,067 --> 01:01:26,867
Say it.

856
01:01:26,867 --> 01:01:29,133
That's what you should do, right?

857
01:01:30,033 --> 01:01:31,700
I have no choice but to come clean.

858
01:01:31,700 --> 01:01:33,867
Don't do that.

859
01:01:36,667 --> 01:01:39,200
Hey, Lee Shin!

860
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:40,800
What are you doing right now, huh?

861
01:01:40,800 --> 01:01:41,767
What!

862
01:01:41,767 --> 01:01:44,000
Hey!

863
01:01:59,867 --> 01:02:00,900
 Open your eyes. 

864
01:02:00,900 --> 01:02:03,767
 Brother! 

865
01:02:18,640 --> 01:02:31,610


866
01:02:38,633 --> 01:02:42,233
♫  Drowning  ♫

867
01:02:42,233 --> 01:02:48,400
♫  In an ocean of grey  ♫

868
01:02:50,067 --> 01:02:53,633
♫  Running  ♫

869
01:02:53,633 --> 01:02:57,800
♫  Running backwards to you  ♫

870
01:02:57,800 --> 01:03:02,900
   

871
01:03:02,900 --> 01:03:05,833
 - Did you wake up? 
 - I feel like I'm dying of hypothermia. 

872
01:03:05,833 --> 01:03:07,367
 Where is Ju Yeon? 

873
01:03:07,367 --> 01:03:09,533
 - She said she's busy. 
 - You didn't tell anyone else. Right? 

874
01:03:09,533 --> 01:03:11,300
 Of course. I'll look into it further. 

875
01:03:11,300 --> 01:03:14,100
 Player Lee Shin came to pick up the documents that day. 

876
01:03:14,100 --> 01:03:16,400
 Is there no CCTV nearby? 

877
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:18,400
   
 I wanted to give you a surprise. 

878
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:20,600
 I will wait here until you arrive. 

879
01:03:20,600 --> 01:03:24,333
 Isn't there someone you want to see when you are sick? 

880
01:03:24,333 --> 01:03:26,533
 Don't worry. I will help you until we find it. 

881
01:03:26,533 --> 01:03:27,700
 What are you doing now? 

882
01:03:27,700 --> 01:03:29,267
 There must be a reason for avoiding you. Right? 

883
01:03:29,267 --> 01:03:30,500
 I like you. 

884
01:03:30,500 --> 01:03:34,900
 You know it's not just about getting my brother to give up on you.
