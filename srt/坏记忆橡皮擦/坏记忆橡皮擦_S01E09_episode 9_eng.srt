 ­  

2
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:14,470
 ­  

3
00:00:16,150 --> 00:00:18,150
   

4
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:22,790
   

5
00:00:25,433 --> 00:00:33,300
   

6
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:39,367
   

7
00:00:40,733 --> 00:00:43,433
Did you already know?

8
00:00:43,433 --> 00:00:45,567
Do you know how my accident happened?

9
00:00:45,567 --> 00:00:47,933
Do you have only a headache? Any other symptoms?

10
00:00:47,933 --> 00:00:49,733
Since when have you had the pain?

11
00:00:49,733 --> 00:00:52,300
This isn't the first time you've felt pain, right?

12
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:55,433
Everyone tried to bury my memories of the accident.

13
00:00:56,533 --> 00:00:59,100
Telling me not to remember it.

14
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:02,033
Why is everyone trying to bury my accident memories?

15
00:01:03,567 --> 00:01:06,633
Is there something I shouldn't remember?

16
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:12,433
Yes.

17
00:01:13,633 --> 00:01:15,567
What is it?

18
00:01:19,867 --> 00:01:23,800
What is everyone hiding from me?

19
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:27,700
We need to go to the hospital first, to Professor Han…

20
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:29,500
Answer me now.

21
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:33,200
Why is everyone lying to me?

22
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,700
It's for your good.

23
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:39,900
For me?

24
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:43,767
   

25
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:58,560


26
00:02:08,467 --> 00:02:10,467
It's tough, right?

27
00:02:11,433 --> 00:02:13,867
The intention was to free him from the pain.

28
00:02:13,867 --> 00:02:16,967
I wonder if it's causing him even more pain.

29
00:02:17,733 --> 00:02:20,200
It seems like it's been all my fault from the beginning.

30
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:22,733
Both the pain and the side effects.

31
00:02:22,733 --> 00:02:27,767
Dr. Kim is conducting research with advice from the U.K. that may be helpful.

32
00:02:27,767 --> 00:02:30,567
Let's wait and see.

33
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:32,160
There will be no issue once we solve the side effects.

34
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,233
   

35
00:02:33,233 --> 00:02:35,000
 Side effects? 

36
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
 There were side effects in the clinical trial? 

37
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:42,630
   

38
00:02:42,633 --> 00:02:45,700
 We need to find out what the side effects are first. 

39
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:48,650
   

40
00:02:55,533 --> 00:02:59,167
Why is Player Lee Shin not answering the phone?

41
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:23,233
 What should I do? 

42
00:03:24,533 --> 00:03:28,200
 Should I talk to the police about the fact that you pushed your brother off a bridge 

43
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:31,267
 into the cold water of the Han River? 

44
00:03:31,267 --> 00:03:32,367
 You bastard! 

45
00:03:32,367 --> 00:03:34,700
 Are you scared that your brother might hear it? 

46
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:39,400
 What about this? Huh? Look at this. 

47
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:43,367
 It looks to me like I was holding my brother back from jumping in. 

48
00:03:44,867 --> 00:03:47,933
 You told the detective that day that 

49
00:03:47,933 --> 00:03:52,400
 you looked back from afar, and he had already jumped. 

50
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,700
 Even if you didn't push him, 

51
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:58,067
 you made a false statement. 

52
00:04:00,567 --> 00:04:02,933
 Is the deal done now? 

53
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:10,700
 Just do what I tell you, you bastard. 

54
00:04:28,567 --> 00:04:32,600
Hey, isn't that the tennis player, Lee Shin?

55
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,667
You're right.

56
00:04:37,667 --> 00:04:42,100
Wow, the athlete is walking around drinking at this hour.

57
00:04:45,433 --> 00:04:47,200
Excuse me.

58
00:04:48,433 --> 00:04:51,033
Please give me another drink instead of this one.

59
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,067
Am I going to die soon?

60
00:05:00,067 --> 00:05:03,167
Who said you're going to die?

61
00:05:03,167 --> 00:05:06,567
But why do you treat me like I'm dying?

62
00:05:06,567 --> 00:05:09,700
Well, people don't die from pretending to be sick.

63
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:12,467
I'm fine because it's me.

64
00:05:12,467 --> 00:05:16,367
But if it were a normal person, they would have already died.

65
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,033
Wait! What are you doing right now?

66
00:05:20,033 --> 00:05:23,033
The IV drip contains a sedative. It has sleep-inducing components.

67
00:05:23,033 --> 00:05:25,767
You've just woken up momentarily. So you'll fall asleep again.

68
00:05:25,767 --> 00:05:27,867
Then, help me out.

69
00:05:27,867 --> 00:05:29,667
What?

70
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:37,400
Are you crazy? Oh, my.

71
00:05:42,333 --> 00:05:44,967
Aren't you hiding something from me?

72
00:05:45,833 --> 00:05:49,533
Are you sure you're not hiding anything?

73
00:05:49,533 --> 00:05:54,967
I'm asking you if there's something that

74
00:05:54,967 --> 00:05:57,800
only you and Shin know and I don't.

75
00:05:59,367 --> 00:06:01,267
No.

76
00:06:02,267 --> 00:06:04,800
Look at me straight in the eye and tell me.

77
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,800
Player Lee Shin?

78
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,933
Where are you now? I've been calling you repeatedly.

79
00:06:29,567 --> 00:06:32,033
Have you had a drink?

80
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:54,433
Sir, I'll bring someone out shortly.

81
00:06:54,433 --> 00:06:56,467
Yes.

82
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:17,667
Excuse me, has Player Lee Shin been here?

83
00:07:19,433 --> 00:07:23,433
I didn't report it because they told me not to, but…

84
00:07:23,433 --> 00:07:25,767
What happened?

85
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:29,367
Over there.

86
00:07:43,567 --> 00:07:46,833
Is this it for thirty minutes?

87
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:49,067
You guys who beat me must be more tired.

88
00:07:49,067 --> 00:07:51,967
Hey! You bastard…

89
00:07:54,067 --> 00:07:56,667
What should I do?

90
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:21,733
 Ju… Ju Yeon. 

91
00:08:21,733 --> 00:08:24,167
It's okay, Kyeng Ju Yeon. Nothing will happen.

92
00:08:24,167 --> 00:08:26,033
 Ju Yeon. 

93
00:08:26,033 --> 00:08:29,367
Nothing will happen. Nothing will happen.

94
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,867
What is it?

95
00:08:42,333 --> 00:08:46,467
Singles versus doubles isn't very sportsmanlike.

96
00:08:46,467 --> 00:08:49,167
He's here.

97
00:08:49,167 --> 00:08:50,267
Who are you?

98
00:08:50,267 --> 00:08:52,433
Oh, me?

99
00:08:52,433 --> 00:08:54,233
That guy's elder brother.

100
00:08:55,933 --> 00:08:58,033
You bastard.

101
00:09:04,333 --> 00:09:06,767
Oh, my.

102
00:09:08,867 --> 00:09:10,467
You're so late.

103
00:09:10,467 --> 00:09:12,433
I almost died from being hit.

104
00:09:12,433 --> 00:09:14,100
Seems like I came just in time?

105
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:17,900
- Right before you die from being hit. 
 - Ah, it hurts. It hurts.

106
00:09:24,567 --> 00:09:28,400
Are you okay? What should I do?

107
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:32,300
Ju Yeon. Our Ju Yeon is here.

108
00:09:35,833 --> 00:09:38,167
It hurts. It hurts.

109
00:09:38,767 --> 00:09:40,367
Stop it, or you'll collapse.

110
00:09:40,367 --> 00:09:43,467
The sedative might make you feel dizzy.

111
00:10:06,833 --> 00:10:10,567
I'll tell the press that I was hit by Lee Shin.

112
00:10:10,567 --> 00:10:11,833
Go ahead. Try it!

113
00:10:11,833 --> 00:10:16,400
Before you go to the press, I'll report it to the police.

114
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:20,467
That guy asked me to hit him!

115
00:10:38,167 --> 00:10:39,900
Did you get hit a lot?

116
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:42,400
Is it your drinking habit to get hit by someone?

117
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:45,200
You're the first woman who saved me.

118
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:48,100
Take me.

119
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:51,900
Are we dating starting today?

120
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,167
Player Lee Shin…

121
00:10:55,167 --> 00:10:57,433
CEO Lee, please help…

122
00:10:58,967 --> 00:11:01,700
Are you sleeping? Now?

123
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:04,467
Ah, right, the sedative.

124
00:11:04,467 --> 00:11:06,000
Are we dating starting today?

125
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,100
- Starting today… 
 - Player Lee Shin.

126
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:10,167
Mr. Lee!

127
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:18,867
Oh, I don't know.

128
00:11:18,867 --> 00:11:22,200
I'll leave you both behind, so do whatever you want.

129
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,600
Got it?

130
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,933
Oh, these brothers really drive me crazy.

131
00:11:27,567 --> 00:11:32,000
   

132
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,667
We are brothers.

133
00:11:36,667 --> 00:11:39,600
Have another drink!

134
00:11:50,967 --> 00:11:52,933
It's so hard.

135
00:11:52,933 --> 00:11:56,267
Hey, brothers.

136
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:02,167
Come on. Get a grip.

137
00:12:03,933 --> 00:12:06,800
Blood... I'm bleeding.

138
00:12:19,533 --> 00:12:22,467
Troublesome brothers.

139
00:12:22,467 --> 00:12:27,520
 My first love...­ 

140
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:46,333
Oh, I feel much better now.

141
00:12:46,333 --> 00:12:48,933
Ah, I'm thirsty.

142
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,900
It hurts.

143
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:54,667
Of course it hurts.

144
00:12:54,667 --> 00:12:57,033
It hurts.

145
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,533
It hurts.

146
00:13:08,067 --> 00:13:11,433
- Oh, my. 
 - It hurts.

147
00:13:13,833 --> 00:13:18,733
You might not even remember it tomorrow, because you're in a semi-conscious state.

148
00:13:18,733 --> 00:13:23,467
This is why I said it's not good to be discharged right away.

149
00:13:26,533 --> 00:13:32,267
As if to prove they are brothers, even the way they fall asleep is the same.

150
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:39,667
Lie down straight, straight.

151
00:13:39,667 --> 00:13:42,200
Put your legs like this.

152
00:14:06,233 --> 00:14:14,900
♫  A day later, you're still a broken man  ♫

153
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:22,800
♫   The only thing that shines through these repeating days  ♫

154
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:29,333
♫  It's you  ♫

155
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:38,133
♫  It's you  ♫

156
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:43,667
♫  It's you  ♫

157
00:14:43,667 --> 00:14:46,400
I've been like this all day. What's wrong with me?

158
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:49,600
♫  It's you  ♫

159
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:52,633
Right, it takes some effort to pull two men along.

160
00:14:52,633 --> 00:14:55,800
It's just premature ventricular contractions due to strenuous exercise.

161
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:58,367
That's got to be it.

162
00:15:01,533 --> 00:15:06,033
 Are you okay? Open your eyes. 

163
00:15:13,567 --> 00:15:16,633
How long are you going to sleep?

164
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:22,333
You two seem to get along better than I thought, don't you?

165
00:15:23,267 --> 00:15:27,100
Since when did you two start sleeping together?

166
00:15:30,867 --> 00:15:32,467
Hey!

167
00:15:32,467 --> 00:15:35,067
Why is that dog here?

168
00:15:35,067 --> 00:15:36,433
In my bed.

169
00:15:36,433 --> 00:15:41,467
I heard groaning noises at night, and he was wagging his tail in the pantry room.

170
00:15:41,467 --> 00:15:43,567
Oh, I'm going to the Athletes' Village soon.

171
00:15:43,567 --> 00:15:46,300
My parents always stay at a nearby hotel,

172
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:47,467
so I guess they brought him here in advance?

173
00:15:47,467 --> 00:15:50,833
Hey, this place is for work, not a pet hotel.

174
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:59,567
I think I stepped on it.

175
00:15:59,567 --> 00:16:01,300
What?

176
00:16:02,333 --> 00:16:04,800
I think I stepped on it.

177
00:16:13,433 --> 00:16:17,467
Cola… What did Cola eat?

178
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,367
Ugh, the smell.

179
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:36,100
Ugh, the smell, seriously!

180
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:38,800
You should feed him only pet food. Why is it so watery?

181
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:42,333
Why is it so watery? Why is it so watery?

182
00:16:42,333 --> 00:16:46,100
It looks like he's in pain whenever he tries to remember something.

183
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:50,900
Is there anything else I don't know about that night?

184
00:17:00,033 --> 00:17:02,200
Cola.

185
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:13,433
My neck hurts a bit.

186
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:32,933
More than that, I think I found the diary you mentioned then.

187
00:17:32,933 --> 00:17:35,233
Really?

188
00:17:37,467 --> 00:17:39,100
That's good to hear. Where is it?

189
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:42,667
Come to the training ground later. It's in the locker.

190
00:17:42,667 --> 00:17:44,400
Yes.

191
00:17:53,233 --> 00:17:56,233
You are appearing on TV.

192
00:17:56,233 --> 00:17:58,033
That's always on the news.

193
00:17:58,033 --> 00:17:59,500
Let's just watch something else.

194
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:02,067
 Finally, we end the morning news with news of the renewal 

195
00:18:02,067 --> 00:18:06,567
   
 of the contract of the tennis star player. 

196
00:18:06,567 --> 00:18:08,800
CEO Hong is really fast.

197
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:11,700
The ink on the signature probably hasn't even dried yet.

198
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,967
   

199
00:18:20,167 --> 00:18:23,633
 Do the 'Dung Flex'. 

200
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:30,800
Thank you for your hard work.

201
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,200
 I don't like it, absolutely not. 

202
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,933
 I'm not doing it. 

203
00:18:33,933 --> 00:18:37,700
I absolutely can't do this!

204
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:39,700
Why are you suddenly saying you can't do it?

205
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:41,900
I don't like the color.

206
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:44,967
If you don't like gold or reddish brown…

207
00:18:44,967 --> 00:18:48,133
The color of the poop is all the same.

208
00:18:48,133 --> 00:18:49,733
I don't like the shape, either.

209
00:18:49,733 --> 00:18:52,600
No, I'm telling you it's the same as it was then.

210
00:19:00,167 --> 00:19:01,533
Little cutie.

211
00:19:01,533 --> 00:19:03,100
Didn't you even look at the storyboard?

212
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:05,600
How can you agree to it without consulting me?

213
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,200
I heard the storyboard was sent to you by email.

214
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:11,100
I didn't realize it was the same storyboard from back then.

215
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:12,700
Am I a child?

216
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:15,833
I heard it was just two months ago.

217
00:19:15,833 --> 00:19:19,400
I've grown 2cm in just two months.

218
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:21,633
I am not a child anymore.

219
00:19:21,633 --> 00:19:25,600
I really hate this so much!

220
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,867
What are you going to do about it?

221
00:19:30,867 --> 00:19:33,367
Whether you convince her or scold her, she has to keep filming it.

222
00:19:33,367 --> 00:19:35,300
This contract was made with the previous agency.

223
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:37,733
I think we need to examine the legal clauses.

224
00:19:37,733 --> 00:19:39,333
Excuse me?

225
00:19:39,333 --> 00:19:42,667
Do you know how much money has been spent on this set?

226
00:19:42,667 --> 00:19:45,400
Then, pay the penalty and all costs incurred today.

227
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:50,533
If you don't cooperate by 5:00 p.m. today, we will consider it a breach of contract.

228
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:55,933
I'll go!

229
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,167
I am sorry.

230
00:20:02,167 --> 00:20:05,200
Little cutie! Little cutie!

231
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:19,033
Yes, hello. This is Lee Kun speaking.

232
00:20:22,410 --> 00:20:25,490
  ­ 

233
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,033
Who is this?

234
00:20:41,033 --> 00:20:43,367
Oh, you're the brother of Player Lee Shin from our agency.

235
00:20:43,367 --> 00:20:45,000
Ah, who would have known

236
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,267
that he would re-sign with me instead of his own brother.

237
00:20:47,267 --> 00:20:51,033
I have to give in to you. I heard that you don't even go out to eat.

238
00:20:51,033 --> 00:20:52,467
Because you are worried that you'll go out of business.

239
00:20:52,467 --> 00:20:56,467
Looks like that'll be you instead.

240
00:20:56,467 --> 00:20:58,700
I heard that Cha Si On is causing trouble.

241
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:01,900
Investors really hate when something is not profitable.

242
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,000
Ah, sir.

243
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,933
CEO Hong.

244
00:21:11,933 --> 00:21:13,200
You already came out like this to greet me.

245
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,867
Welcome.

246
00:21:14,867 --> 00:21:19,167
Thanks to Lee Shin's contract renewal, the agency's image has also improved.

247
00:21:19,167 --> 00:21:22,267
It's all thanks to you, sir.

248
00:21:22,267 --> 00:21:24,467
- Let's go in. 
 - Yes.

249
00:21:24,467 --> 00:21:26,700
Mr. Lee, wait here.

250
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:34,000
Jincheon Athletes' Village?

251
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,933
You want me to go all the way there and interpret for you?

252
00:21:36,933 --> 00:21:39,133
Yes.

253
00:21:39,133 --> 00:21:41,167
Yes, yes.

254
00:21:41,167 --> 00:21:43,900
Yes.

255
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:49,200
It's a shame, but I'm sure you'll be able to find another competent interpreter somewhere.

256
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,800
Yes.

257
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:53,167
Okay, then. Just hang up the phone now.

258
00:21:53,167 --> 00:21:55,967
I need to dig up the ground to drink beer.

259
00:21:57,367 --> 00:22:00,833
After clearing out all the beer in the fridge,

260
00:22:00,833 --> 00:22:02,667
beer started coming out of the ground.

261
00:22:02,667 --> 00:22:05,900
I should farm beer at our house.

262
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:11,033
I had only put a few in just to drink occasionally.

263
00:22:11,033 --> 00:22:12,600
Oh, ma'am…

264
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:15,833
If you're going to just wander around doing nothing, then just go back home.

265
00:22:15,833 --> 00:22:17,500
Why?

266
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:19,433
Ma'am.

267
00:22:19,433 --> 00:22:22,767
Your mom is asking me to send you back quickly.

268
00:22:22,767 --> 00:22:27,033
I heard you go back and forth to the countryside every day.

269
00:22:27,033 --> 00:22:30,400
What are you wandering around for?

270
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,233
To the countryside…

271
00:22:32,233 --> 00:22:34,967
Oh, hold on. Hold on.

272
00:22:34,967 --> 00:22:37,967
Where is the Jincheon Athletes' Village?

273
00:22:40,767 --> 00:22:42,733
- You've worked hard. 
 - Yeah.

274
00:22:42,733 --> 00:22:44,900
Good job.

275
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:47,850
Hey, what's this? Are these new uniforms?

276
00:22:47,850 --> 00:22:50,130
 ­  

277
00:22:50,130 --> 00:22:53,833
Stay still. Stay still.

278
00:22:56,433 --> 00:22:58,833
Coach Bang?

279
00:22:58,833 --> 00:23:01,190
Oh, Shin.

280
00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:03,060
Oh, this...

281
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:04,867
You came early?

282
00:23:04,867 --> 00:23:06,667
Don't tell me, your face…

283
00:23:06,667 --> 00:23:08,667
Is it because of me punching you back then?

284
00:23:08,667 --> 00:23:11,067
That can't be.

285
00:23:11,067 --> 00:23:13,233
I was wondering

286
00:23:13,233 --> 00:23:16,033
if this fist was actually cotton candy.

287
00:23:16,033 --> 00:23:17,267
It was very sweet.

288
00:23:17,267 --> 00:23:19,500
Well, hey…

289
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:22,700
You…

290
00:23:23,433 --> 00:23:26,633
I was sorry for that day.

291
00:23:26,633 --> 00:23:28,900
It's okay.

292
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:30,867
Ah, where's my partner?

293
00:23:30,867 --> 00:23:33,367
That's right. She's filming now, right?

294
00:23:33,367 --> 00:23:34,467
Player Lee Shin?

295
00:23:34,467 --> 00:23:36,067
Filming?

296
00:23:36,067 --> 00:23:38,167
It's total chaos.

297
00:23:38,167 --> 00:23:39,967
She ran away because she doesn't want to film.

298
00:23:39,967 --> 00:23:41,900
Because she insisted on not wearing a poop costume.

299
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:44,367
But Kun is trying to do as she says.

300
00:23:44,367 --> 00:23:46,200
He is on the verge of bankruptcy right now.

301
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:48,467
Did she cause another incident?

302
00:23:48,467 --> 00:23:51,600
Typical Cha Si On.

303
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:52,633
I don't know what he's going to do about it.

304
00:23:52,633 --> 00:23:55,867
Oh? Ju Yeon.

305
00:23:57,833 --> 00:23:59,333
Ju Yeon.

306
00:23:59,333 --> 00:24:01,667
Oh? Player Lee Shin.

307
00:24:03,933 --> 00:24:08,367
Coach, I'm sorry about what happened last time.

308
00:24:10,533 --> 00:24:13,367
Translation app…

309
00:24:15,533 --> 00:24:17,600
Wait! Wait.

310
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,333
- Have a good day at work today. 
 - Yeah.

311
00:24:19,333 --> 00:24:21,800
- Go for it! 
 - Bye.

312
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,800
Hey, Dalgona! Welcome.

313
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:26,333
Please take care of me.

314
00:24:26,333 --> 00:24:29,533
And no need for apologies.

315
00:24:29,533 --> 00:24:32,867
Start preparing to keep in step with Player Si On from tomorrow.

316
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:36,933
Well…

317
00:24:36,933 --> 00:24:40,533
He said you should keep in step well with Player Si On.

318
00:24:40,533 --> 00:24:44,000
Hey, what are you doing here?

319
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:47,867
Are you singing a song now?

320
00:24:47,867 --> 00:24:49,667
I got a job here as an interpreter.

321
00:24:49,667 --> 00:24:52,167
What?

322
00:24:52,167 --> 00:24:54,833
Then, how do you know my Ju Yeon?

323
00:24:55,567 --> 00:24:57,933
Are you talking about  my  Ju Yeon?

324
00:24:57,933 --> 00:25:00,900
She's my roommate. We live together.

325
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:02,033
What?

326
00:25:02,033 --> 00:25:06,500
 My  Ju Yeon recommended this job to me too.

327
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:08,467
Oh, right.

328
00:25:08,467 --> 00:25:12,300
You didn't show up to the meeting the other day.

329
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:13,967
The other day?

330
00:25:13,967 --> 00:25:18,967
Then, did you meet Cha Si On and CEO?

331
00:25:18,967 --> 00:25:21,500
Was there anything special? What did you talk about?

332
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:26,233
What? Are you jealous by any chance?

333
00:25:26,233 --> 00:25:28,167
- Follow me, follow me. 
 - Hey, hey!

334
00:25:28,167 --> 00:25:29,133
You bastard!

335
00:25:29,133 --> 00:25:33,333
Hey! Let go!

336
00:25:34,633 --> 00:25:35,867
Quit right now.

337
00:25:35,867 --> 00:25:40,300
This is my territory. We shouldn't invade each other's territories.

338
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:42,133
Why?

339
00:25:42,133 --> 00:25:45,733
Are you afraid that I'll tell everyone about my brief fling with you?

340
00:25:45,733 --> 00:25:46,833
Hey, don't worry.

341
00:25:46,833 --> 00:25:49,333
Would I really reveal my shameful past with my own mouth?

342
00:25:49,333 --> 00:25:52,767
Listen well. The CEO you met the other day is my elder brother.

343
00:25:52,767 --> 00:25:56,800
And Ju Yeon is my brother's first love that he's been looking for.

344
00:25:58,167 --> 00:26:01,467
What does that have to do with me?

345
00:26:01,467 --> 00:26:04,467
Don't think about it too much, just remember that.

346
00:26:04,467 --> 00:26:05,600
I'm telling you to back off.

347
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,767
What if I don't want to?

348
00:26:07,767 --> 00:26:10,267
I will tell the coach

349
00:26:10,267 --> 00:26:13,267
directly to fire you.

350
00:26:13,267 --> 00:26:14,467
Do whatever you want.

351
00:26:14,467 --> 00:26:17,200
How are you going to tell him? You don't even speak Italian.

352
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,000
Try to live a more civilized life.

353
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,567
If I have this one thing, it'll work.

354
00:26:20,567 --> 00:26:23,867
Oh, really? Then I'll have to say in Italian beforehand not to listen to that.

355
00:26:23,867 --> 00:26:26,100
Then he won't understand what you're saying.

356
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:29,467
Why do you keep interfering in my life?

357
00:26:29,467 --> 00:26:32,667
I don't even care about you.

358
00:26:32,667 --> 00:26:36,067
Here is close to the countryside, so I can find that person and do my work.

359
00:26:36,067 --> 00:26:38,867
Anyway! Don't mind it.

360
00:26:38,867 --> 00:26:43,600
Why hasn't the man you're looking for shown up yet?

361
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:46,633
Have you ever considered that he doesn't want to meet you?

362
00:26:46,633 --> 00:26:48,367
Think about it carefully.

363
00:26:48,367 --> 00:26:52,600
Why hasn't anyone who knows him yet appeared in that small country village?

364
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:55,933
Did he really not show up?

365
00:26:55,933 --> 00:27:00,500
He may not want you to find him.

366
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:06,800
 ­  

367
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:08,867
Hey!

368
00:27:09,650 --> 00:27:14,330
   

369
00:27:14,333 --> 00:27:18,433
   

370
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:30,533
   

371
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:57,967
Did you take a teary selfie with artificial tears?

372
00:27:57,967 --> 00:28:01,433
Inducing sympathy reduces malicious comments.

373
00:28:01,433 --> 00:28:05,933
What? Did he call you and ask you to come and see me?

374
00:28:07,067 --> 00:28:10,267
Didn't you post it on social media on purpose?

375
00:28:10,267 --> 00:28:14,433
You felt sorry for causing an accident and running away, so you at least told him your whereabouts.

376
00:28:14,433 --> 00:28:16,333
I guess school was the only place you could go.

377
00:28:16,333 --> 00:28:19,000
Even if I'm an athlete, I shouldn't stay away from studying.

378
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,067
School days won't come back again.

379
00:28:22,067 --> 00:28:25,900
Seems like you're just spacing out all day, huh?

380
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:30,133
Mr. Lee agreed you don't have to do that, but why did you still run away?

381
00:28:30,133 --> 00:28:32,533
He's so soft.

382
00:28:32,533 --> 00:28:36,133
Why does he do everything I ask? Does he want to go out of business?

383
00:28:36,133 --> 00:28:39,700
Why? Are you worried about him?

384
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:42,567
You are young, but you are a national representative.

385
00:28:42,567 --> 00:28:47,233
A player representing a country cannot do as he or she pleases. Do you understand?

386
00:28:48,133 --> 00:28:51,333
Should I tell you how I feel?

387
00:28:51,333 --> 00:28:53,500
   

388
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:55,733
Who did such a mean thing?

389
00:28:55,733 --> 00:28:58,033
I was excited when I first filmed the commercial.

390
00:28:58,033 --> 00:29:00,533
I filmed a commercial for a major pharmaceutical company

391
00:29:00,533 --> 00:29:02,833
and used the money I received to pay for coaching.

392
00:29:02,833 --> 00:29:05,367
But they used to call me the 'nation's fairy,'

393
00:29:05,367 --> 00:29:08,533
and now they call me 'the nation's poop girl.'

394
00:29:08,533 --> 00:29:12,000
I'm not even a junior, I'm a senior national team member now,

395
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,533
so I don't want people to look at me like that anymore.

396
00:29:16,367 --> 00:29:18,967
You keep talking from other people's perspectives.

397
00:29:18,967 --> 00:29:23,200
What you think is important, not these few trashy perspectives.

398
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:25,633
You should be the one who is upright.

399
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:31,967
Do you know the three most useless phrases are?

400
00:29:31,967 --> 00:29:35,233
"Don't stress out." "Raise your self-esteem."

401
00:29:35,233 --> 00:29:39,267
"Don't care about what others think." Can you do that?

402
00:29:39,267 --> 00:29:42,433
I don't want to care about what other people say.

403
00:29:42,433 --> 00:29:45,700
But the more I hear it,

404
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:50,333
the more it seems like it's true.

405
00:29:51,333 --> 00:29:53,567
They don't know anything about me.

406
00:30:15,333 --> 00:30:17,600
Trash bag!

407
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,567
Did you just swear?

408
00:30:19,567 --> 00:30:23,600
I said trash bag. Trash bag!

409
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:30,033
So, I gave you a trash bag like this.

410
00:30:30,033 --> 00:30:31,200
What are you going to do?

411
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:35,067
I have to throw it away. What? Should I take it home with me?

412
00:30:35,067 --> 00:30:36,233
That's right.

413
00:30:36,233 --> 00:30:40,367
Are you going to take it knowing it's obviously trash? You should throw it away.

414
00:30:40,367 --> 00:30:43,500
If you know that the words of strangers are trash, just throw them away.

415
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:47,367
Now you know how to tell the difference between what is trash and what is not.

416
00:30:47,367 --> 00:30:52,300
Rumors keep popping up day after day.

417
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:55,100
When I lose a game, I'm the one who's the most upset.

418
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:58,333
But instead of comforting me, they cuss me out instead.

419
00:30:58,333 --> 00:31:02,767
You know what's better than someone consoling you?

420
00:31:02,767 --> 00:31:06,133
You can comfort yourself.

421
00:31:06,133 --> 00:31:08,333
Here, like this.

422
00:31:08,333 --> 00:31:11,867
Si On has worked hard today. Si On is the best.

423
00:31:11,867 --> 00:31:16,433
I'm truly my favourite person.

424
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:20,000
You don't have a boyfriend, right?

425
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,133
Would you like me to set you up on a blind date?

426
00:31:21,133 --> 00:31:24,133
I have a friend who likes older people.

427
00:31:25,567 --> 00:31:28,700
This is called a "butterfly hug."

428
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:30,900
It will make you feel very peaceful.

429
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:33,867
Cross your arms into an X and then hug yourself.

430
00:31:33,867 --> 00:31:36,800
And gently stroke and pat yourself.

431
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:39,633
That's right. I lost, but I fought well.

432
00:31:39,633 --> 00:31:43,067
I'm your number one fan. I support you so much. You're the best.

433
00:31:43,067 --> 00:31:45,600
I was so sexy during the game today.

434
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:50,700
I love myself the most, fervently, passionately!

435
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:55,200
Now, in this way, Player Si On…

436
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:59,633
Player Si On.

437
00:32:17,967 --> 00:32:21,333
 I sincerely thank you for investing so generously. 

438
00:32:21,333 --> 00:32:24,467
Let's have a meal with Player Lee Shin next time.

439
00:32:24,467 --> 00:32:28,567
Of course, I will contact you next time.

440
00:32:37,133 --> 00:32:40,500
I have something to discuss with you regarding Player Cha Si On's advertising contract.

441
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:42,200
I've received a call from the advertiser.

442
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:44,667
We're investing, not doing charity.

443
00:32:44,667 --> 00:32:47,467
We'll arrange it with the sportswear company the player prefers,

444
00:32:47,467 --> 00:32:49,167
and we'll handle any losses.

445
00:32:49,167 --> 00:32:50,700
I won't say it twice.

446
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:53,233
Well, sir.

447
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:01,867
Yes, Coach.

448
00:33:08,233 --> 00:33:11,400
Ah, it's refreshing.

449
00:33:12,167 --> 00:33:15,067
Cut! Oh, that was good.

450
00:33:15,067 --> 00:33:17,867
But, just a bit more of refreshing vibe! Let's do it one more time.

451
00:33:17,867 --> 00:33:19,633
Yes.

452
00:33:23,767 --> 00:33:27,167
Ready, action!

453
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:36,967
Move aside, constipation!

454
00:33:36,967 --> 00:33:40,733
Now do the 'Dung Flex'.

455
00:33:42,367 --> 00:33:45,367
Cut! Okay!

456
00:33:45,367 --> 00:33:47,900
That's good. Why didn't you do it like this before?

457
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:49,300
Let's take a short break.

458
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:52,167
Let's take a short break.

459
00:33:56,533 --> 00:33:58,233
Little cutie.

460
00:33:58,233 --> 00:33:59,733
This is…

461
00:33:59,733 --> 00:34:01,067
You don't have to force yourself to do it. Let's go.

462
00:34:01,067 --> 00:34:03,700
Trash bag! Do you know that?

463
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:07,567
What? You shouldn't swear.

464
00:34:07,567 --> 00:34:09,300
Ah, never mind.

465
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:13,633
It makes me sad to think that someone else might show up wearing this costume.

466
00:34:13,633 --> 00:34:16,933
I don't care if I'm called the nation's poop girl or the nation's fairy.

467
00:34:16,933 --> 00:34:20,933
The agency has been giving me money for years to keep me playing for a long time.

468
00:34:20,933 --> 00:34:22,967
Why…

469
00:34:24,667 --> 00:34:27,533
As I promised at the beginning, I'll let you concentrate only on your sports.

470
00:34:27,533 --> 00:34:29,167
We can handle the advertising contract affairs no matter how much…

471
00:34:29,167 --> 00:34:33,367
No, mister. Relax.

472
00:34:33,367 --> 00:34:36,267
Dr. Kyeong came to my school earlier and taught me.

473
00:34:36,267 --> 00:34:39,367
Kyeong… Dr. Kyeong Ju Yeon?

474
00:34:39,367 --> 00:34:43,000
Peace! Try to find some tranquility in your mind.

475
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,833
Now, try to follow me.

476
00:34:45,833 --> 00:34:49,700
Dear, dear! You did well.

477
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:52,900
Dear, dear! You should be a huge success!

478
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:56,933
Dear, dear. Kun, dear, dear.

479
00:34:56,933 --> 00:35:01,800
Dear, dear. Great job, Kun. You should be a huge success!

480
00:35:20,367 --> 00:35:22,933
When is your owner coming?

481
00:35:22,933 --> 00:35:24,733
It's not that I'm waiting or anything.

482
00:35:24,733 --> 00:35:29,400
I'm just waiting with you in case you get bored.

483
00:35:30,233 --> 00:35:33,133
   

484
00:35:38,467 --> 00:35:39,967
Hello.

485
00:35:39,967 --> 00:35:41,767
 Where are you? 

486
00:35:41,767 --> 00:35:44,167
I took a nap at the agency.

487
00:35:44,167 --> 00:35:49,667
Well, if you haven't eaten yet, let's eat something together.

488
00:35:49,667 --> 00:35:51,567
Eat?

489
00:35:51,567 --> 00:35:53,500
I haven't eaten yet.

490
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:56,500
But I thought you said we weren't going to eat together?

491
00:35:58,567 --> 00:36:00,000
If you don't want to, just say so.

492
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,900
 No, it's not that I don't want to. 

493
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:05,767
A company dinner is okay. A company dinner.

494
00:36:06,967 --> 00:36:10,800
See you in 30 minutes at the food stall in front of the training grounds.

495
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:13,933
I need time to get ready—

496
00:36:13,933 --> 00:36:16,633
Hello? Hello?

497
00:36:17,233 --> 00:36:20,867
If he asks me to come, should I go right away?

498
00:36:20,867 --> 00:36:23,300
I should go. He's my subject of the experiment.

499
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:26,000
Cola, I'll be back soon.

500
00:36:27,567 --> 00:36:29,933
Well, only giving me 30 minutes?

501
00:36:29,933 --> 00:36:33,233
Does he think I'll come to him right away if he tells me to? It's so funny.

502
00:36:33,233 --> 00:36:37,400
Oh, taxi! Here, over here!

503
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:44,300
♫  Don't say it, I can't see how I feel  ♫

504
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:46,733
Sir, please go to the street food stall in front of the Olympic Stadium.

505
00:36:46,733 --> 00:36:48,233
Could you please hurry a little?

506
00:36:48,233 --> 00:36:50,867
I'm worried the noodles might get soggy.

507
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:54,000
♫  I'm very clumsy  ♫

508
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:59,200
♫  I can only use expressions I don't like  ♫

509
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:04,167
♫  You know everything. I love you so much  ♫

510
00:37:04,167 --> 00:37:10,300
♫  Please be like this to me at every moment  ♫

511
00:37:20,033 --> 00:37:22,467
I'm sorry, but today I…

512
00:37:22,467 --> 00:37:24,867
 I'm here all alone. 

513
00:37:26,167 --> 00:37:28,467
Can you come over now?

514
00:37:33,833 --> 00:37:37,100
Player Lee Shin, I have an appointment now…

515
00:37:38,233 --> 00:37:39,667
What happened?

516
00:37:39,667 --> 00:37:42,267
No, it's just…

517
00:37:42,267 --> 00:37:44,933
To give you my brother's diary.

518
00:37:57,533 --> 00:38:02,200
Ma'am, please give us two bowls of noodles.

519
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:04,033
Can I borrow this for a moment?

520
00:38:04,033 --> 00:38:07,067
I heard that women shouldn't sit in cold places.

521
00:38:07,067 --> 00:38:08,067
Take it.

522
00:38:08,067 --> 00:38:09,567
Thank you.

523
00:38:09,567 --> 00:38:12,233
Oh, it's so fluffy.

524
00:38:12,867 --> 00:38:15,367
Oh my.

525
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,300
Okay.

526
00:38:30,933 --> 00:38:34,533
His true first love appeared in front of him.

527
00:38:35,967 --> 00:38:38,800
And she even knows Ju Yeon?

528
00:38:41,067 --> 00:38:46,267
If he keeps running into Jeon Sae Yan,

529
00:38:46,267 --> 00:38:48,833
his memories might come back.

530
00:38:50,867 --> 00:38:53,300
Jeon Sae Yan.

531
00:38:56,900 --> 00:39:00,133
If it's Ju Yeon, she can persuade her.

532
00:39:01,233 --> 00:39:03,400
I'll tell her everything

533
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:06,433
about his true first love.

534
00:39:35,367 --> 00:39:36,967
This is really…

535
00:39:36,967 --> 00:39:39,633
Anyone who sees you will think you came right away after waiting for a phone call.

536
00:39:39,633 --> 00:39:44,167
Wow, I wondered why my steps were drawn here.

537
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:50,167
I already have company. Ju Yeon.

538
00:39:50,167 --> 00:39:53,067
Really? Ju Yeon? That's great.

539
00:39:53,067 --> 00:39:54,767
Then, we can eat together.

540
00:39:54,767 --> 00:39:55,900
Let's wait together.

541
00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:58,400
Ma'am, please give me one more bowl of noodles.

542
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:00,633
Yes.

543
00:40:03,833 --> 00:40:08,667
I'll eat it first because it shouldn't get cold.

544
00:40:08,667 --> 00:40:10,533
That, the…

545
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:25,667
 Let's have the company dinner later. I'll go to the agency after work. 

546
00:40:25,667 --> 00:40:31,367
Then, please eat a lot and enjoy it.

547
00:40:31,367 --> 00:40:34,767
Oh, you got rejected.

548
00:40:34,767 --> 00:40:38,133
Ju Yeon has a bad impression of you these days.

549
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:44,367
Why? What did she say?

550
00:40:46,133 --> 00:40:47,767
The main dish is missing, isn't it?

551
00:40:47,767 --> 00:40:49,100
What?

552
00:40:49,100 --> 00:40:51,500
Ma'am, just give us two bottles of beer here.

553
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:53,233
Yes.

554
00:40:53,233 --> 00:40:55,433
The main dish.

555
00:40:56,833 --> 00:40:59,633
Thank you.

556
00:40:59,633 --> 00:41:04,033
So, what did Ju Yeon say about me?

557
00:41:05,033 --> 00:41:05,933
Wow.

558
00:41:05,933 --> 00:41:09,133
I'm a bit thirsty, so I'll start.

559
00:41:13,633 --> 00:41:18,267
This water is enough for me.

560
00:41:19,167 --> 00:41:22,467
I feel bad drinking alone.

561
00:41:22,467 --> 00:41:25,900
Then, this… I've washed my hands.

562
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:29,467
Like this, sort of…

563
00:41:29,467 --> 00:41:32,000
Pretend to drink.

564
00:41:33,567 --> 00:41:35,467
Like a cocktail.

565
00:41:35,467 --> 00:41:38,300
- Cocktail… 
 - Cheers.

566
00:42:07,567 --> 00:42:12,300
There's no one here. Did you rent the whole place?

567
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:15,067
The place can't match your beauty.

568
00:42:15,067 --> 00:42:18,500
Here, have a seat.

569
00:42:23,533 --> 00:42:26,033
Your beauty is beyond the limit.

570
00:42:28,167 --> 00:42:31,033
Do you know that you are sometimes cheesy?

571
00:42:32,833 --> 00:42:34,920
What about the notebook?

572
00:42:35,467 --> 00:42:39,233
This isn't some kind of police interrogation.

573
00:42:39,233 --> 00:42:41,200
Are we just going to get to the point?

574
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:46,167
Let's talk about the weather, and also catch up a bit.

575
00:42:46,167 --> 00:42:48,933
The view is nice.

576
00:42:53,533 --> 00:42:57,000
If I see a river, it's a river view.

577
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,867
If I see the ocean, it's an ocean view.

578
00:42:59,867 --> 00:43:02,367
If I see Ju Yeon,

579
00:43:03,767 --> 00:43:06,000
I love you*. 
  (The Korean pronunciation/spelling of the English words "view" and "-ve you" is the same.) 

580
00:43:08,067 --> 00:43:11,667
What about the notebook? The emotion diary.

581
00:43:15,567 --> 00:43:19,300
Still, we have to eat the signature dish here.

582
00:43:19,300 --> 00:43:23,100
I've rented out this whole place, right?

583
00:43:28,433 --> 00:43:31,567
So what Ju Yeon always said was…

584
00:43:31,567 --> 00:43:32,967
We drank all the beer.

585
00:43:32,967 --> 00:43:34,833
Ma'am, one more beer for us please

586
00:43:34,833 --> 00:43:36,467
No, no.

587
00:43:36,467 --> 00:43:40,367
We've eaten enough, so I'll be going now.

588
00:43:42,367 --> 00:43:45,100
By the way, your first love.

589
00:43:45,767 --> 00:43:47,633
Ju Yeon.

590
00:43:47,633 --> 00:43:51,067
I heard you've been looking for her for a very long time.

591
00:43:51,067 --> 00:43:52,400
How was it?

592
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:54,933
You must have imagined a lot.

593
00:43:54,933 --> 00:43:58,567
How might her face have changed? What would she like?

594
00:43:58,567 --> 00:44:00,233
Could she be married?

595
00:44:00,233 --> 00:44:03,300
What would her reaction be when seeing me?

596
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:07,333
How was it? Was it as you imagined?

597
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:15,733
Actually, I am also looking for someone right now.

598
00:44:16,467 --> 00:44:19,000
But I haven't thought about that.

599
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:22,400
What would that person's reaction be when seeing me?

600
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:25,967
Not everyone can feel the same way I do.

601
00:44:25,967 --> 00:44:31,133
I wonder if I'm just searching out of my own greed…

602
00:44:35,467 --> 00:44:39,000
You'll know once you try it.

603
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,433
But what if I get hurt in the process?

604
00:44:41,433 --> 00:44:44,233
Then, I would be just too pitiful.

605
00:44:51,433 --> 00:44:54,200
The touch of that child on that day.

606
00:44:55,033 --> 00:44:56,500
The calm tone of voice.

607
00:44:56,500 --> 00:44:59,267
The scent of the waterside.

608
00:44:59,267 --> 00:45:05,067
I remember the event from 15 years ago as if it was yesterday.

609
00:45:05,067 --> 00:45:08,067
I've missed her for a very long time.

610
00:45:08,067 --> 00:45:10,167
And finally, we've reunited.

611
00:45:10,167 --> 00:45:15,533
Well, you know the result.

612
00:45:17,167 --> 00:45:20,200
Even if she doesn't remember me at all, I remember her.

613
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:23,500
Even if she doesn't like me at all, I like…

614
00:45:27,733 --> 00:45:31,433
Even if I could go back to before I found her,

615
00:45:31,433 --> 00:45:33,500
I would gladly find her again.

616
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:35,433
Willingly.

617
00:45:36,833 --> 00:45:40,433
Wow, I want this kind of guy.

618
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:45,067
You're a very charming man.

619
00:45:45,067 --> 00:45:48,633
If I had been your first love, I wouldn't have hurt you like that.

620
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:53,367
Thanks to you, I had a very good meal.

621
00:45:55,167 --> 00:45:56,433
Also,

622
00:45:56,433 --> 00:46:01,333
I don't quite remember exactly what Ju Yeon said.

623
00:46:02,200 --> 00:46:04,867
But she worries about you a lot.

624
00:46:10,633 --> 00:46:12,100
Well…

625
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:19,830
Oh, I...

626
00:46:21,433 --> 00:46:24,940
Can you give me a ride…

627
00:46:31,700 --> 00:46:34,800
This is just an agenda.

628
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:40,500
I found it in the dust.

629
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:42,433
Then it's not at home.

630
00:46:42,433 --> 00:46:45,800
My brother threw away everything he used before.

631
00:46:47,100 --> 00:46:49,500
Then we can do nothing about it.

632
00:46:57,867 --> 00:47:00,130
Does it not taste good?

633
00:47:00,733 --> 00:47:03,000
Ah, no.

634
00:47:06,067 --> 00:47:08,900
The view is really nice.

635
00:47:08,900 --> 00:47:13,300
That's the 57th time you've said that.

636
00:47:17,267 --> 00:47:21,167
I heard that you are acquainted with the interpreter.

637
00:47:21,167 --> 00:47:23,833
We are living together for a while.

638
00:47:23,833 --> 00:47:28,667
Please take care of her. She has never worked before because of strict home rules.

639
00:47:29,467 --> 00:47:31,567
I see.

640
00:47:33,367 --> 00:47:35,440
That's true.

641
00:47:36,067 --> 00:47:40,267
She'll probably quit soon because the home rules are strict.

642
00:47:40,267 --> 00:47:41,767
- Pardon? 
 - Okay.

643
00:47:41,767 --> 00:47:44,833
No, nothing.

644
00:47:45,467 --> 00:47:48,733
Can I eat this by any chance?

645
00:47:48,733 --> 00:47:52,300
I have to manage my weight again when I enter the Athletes' Village.

646
00:47:53,667 --> 00:47:55,767
Please eat up.

647
00:48:05,233 --> 00:48:07,733
My brother used to sneak food into his room

648
00:48:07,733 --> 00:48:12,267
and eat it when he was a junior player.

649
00:48:12,267 --> 00:48:14,033
He did that when he was young?

650
00:48:14,033 --> 00:48:17,867
So, he must have eaten alone back then. Right?

651
00:48:17,867 --> 00:48:20,633
My brother really liked jelly.

652
00:48:20,633 --> 00:48:23,533
He was caught by the coach while secretly eating jelly.

653
00:48:23,533 --> 00:48:25,733
And there was a death course in front of the training ground.

654
00:48:25,733 --> 00:48:28,167
He used to run there every day.

655
00:48:28,167 --> 00:48:30,833
What? Did he like jelly that much?

656
00:48:30,833 --> 00:48:35,100
I thought he wouldn't touch anything unhealthy, but he has the taste of a kid.

657
00:48:35,100 --> 00:48:38,100
He's not even a child.

658
00:48:40,633 --> 00:48:44,200
I like chocolate better than jelly.

659
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:46,167
What flavor of jelly does he like?

660
00:48:46,167 --> 00:48:49,867
Does he like something like ginseng-flavored jelly?

661
00:48:49,867 --> 00:48:52,800
I wonder if he cuts jelly like this and eats it.

662
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:56,233
It's so funny.

663
00:48:57,367 --> 00:48:59,400
Do you like my brother?

664
00:49:03,900 --> 00:49:07,133
- Pardon? 
 - Whenever we talk about him,

665
00:49:07,133 --> 00:49:09,833
your eyes sparkle.

666
00:49:12,667 --> 00:49:15,700
I guess it's because I have to write an observation journal.

667
00:49:15,700 --> 00:49:19,700
It's a natural interest as a researcher.

668
00:49:21,100 --> 00:49:23,033
Well, that's a relief.

669
00:49:23,033 --> 00:49:26,133
He thinks you are his first love,

670
00:49:26,133 --> 00:49:29,300
so he might feel that way,

671
00:49:29,300 --> 00:49:32,067
but you know that my brother's first love

672
00:49:32,067 --> 00:49:34,500
is not you.

673
00:49:39,500 --> 00:49:43,433
Yes, of course.

674
00:49:45,130 --> 00:49:48,333
♫  Where will it be  ♫

675
00:49:48,333 --> 00:49:50,767
Ju Yeon, try this.

676
00:49:52,733 --> 00:50:00,467
♫  How much further do I have to go before I can see  ♫

677
00:50:00,467 --> 00:50:06,933
♫  Even if that unreachable dream  ♫

678
00:50:06,933 --> 00:50:15,333
♫  Turns away from me and becomes more blurred  ♫

679
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:23,067
♫  I will walk towards that day  ♫

680
00:50:23,833 --> 00:50:27,600
I feel like I've been really drained of energy today.

681
00:50:30,367 --> 00:50:33,733
What time is it now? She's just home?

682
00:50:48,333 --> 00:50:52,367
My house really is the best.

683
00:50:53,500 --> 00:50:55,800
This is my house, though.

684
00:50:55,800 --> 00:50:59,433
Technically, it belongs to the landlord.

685
00:50:59,433 --> 00:51:01,800
I couldn't even eat properly.

686
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:05,600
I just watched her drink.

687
00:51:10,267 --> 00:51:12,400
Would you like to drink together?

688
00:51:13,367 --> 00:51:15,300
Okay.

689
00:51:29,467 --> 00:51:32,833
- Here. 
 - Ah, mine.

690
00:51:32,833 --> 00:51:34,967
It's mine.

691
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:39,333
Cheers.

692
00:51:39,333 --> 00:51:41,367
Cheers.

693
00:52:01,700 --> 00:52:03,833
Oh my.

694
00:52:14,167 --> 00:52:17,000
He's handsome.

695
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:18,533
What am I saying? Oh my.

696
00:52:18,533 --> 00:52:21,467
Am I so tired that I'm talking nonsense?

697
00:52:21,467 --> 00:52:24,433
Oh my.

698
00:52:29,967 --> 00:52:32,933
If it's not because of coffee,

699
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:37,533
unless my heart is pounding

700
00:52:37,533 --> 00:52:40,500
because I'm scared or in pain.

701
00:53:06,167 --> 00:53:08,500
Oh my, oh my.

702
00:53:15,500 --> 00:53:17,533
Ugh, I slept well.

703
00:53:17,533 --> 00:53:20,600
I also fell asleep… What time is it now?

704
00:53:34,833 --> 00:53:37,433
Why are we here?

705
00:53:37,433 --> 00:53:42,067
Self-esteem starts with small things.

706
00:53:43,467 --> 00:53:45,600
Shh.

707
00:53:50,600 --> 00:53:54,533
Can't we just come during the day?

708
00:53:54,533 --> 00:53:58,767
That's why… That's why I said I would come alone.

709
00:53:59,900 --> 00:54:02,767
- Are you scared? 
 - Yes.

710
00:54:02,767 --> 00:54:04,867
Oh, gosh.

711
00:54:04,867 --> 00:54:06,967
Don't do that.

712
00:54:06,967 --> 00:54:09,300
- Ah, you startled me! 
 - So why did you come with me?

713
00:54:09,300 --> 00:54:12,167
Ugh, really.

714
00:54:16,500 --> 00:54:19,900
- Let's go. 
 - Uh, just a minute.

715
00:54:19,900 --> 00:54:22,500
Let's go slowly.

716
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:30,633
Now, let's go.

717
00:54:41,767 --> 00:54:46,067
Seriously, please stop that.

718
00:54:46,067 --> 00:54:48,400
Let's go.

719
00:55:23,870 --> 00:55:25,830
 ­  
   

720
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:29,700
I'm planning to change it to a new desk.

721
00:55:29,700 --> 00:55:32,200
No matter how much I try not to care,

722
00:55:32,200 --> 00:55:35,067
she's still young, so…

723
00:55:35,067 --> 00:55:38,667
By the way, our hands…

724
00:55:41,900 --> 00:55:44,567
There will be probably be a new desk in the storage room.

725
00:55:44,567 --> 00:55:50,433
But that would be like giving them a new sketchbook.

726
00:55:51,133 --> 00:55:52,600
Let's doodle on it.

727
00:55:52,600 --> 00:55:54,167
Doodle?

728
00:55:54,167 --> 00:55:56,467
Let's raise her pride as a national representative,

729
00:55:56,467 --> 00:55:59,467
and let the students know about the status of Player Si On,

730
00:55:59,467 --> 00:56:04,867
Let's doodle something that even the most mischievous guys will never be able to doodle over.

731
00:56:05,667 --> 00:56:07,500
Okay.

732
00:56:07,500 --> 00:56:08,700
I'll take red.

733
00:56:08,700 --> 00:56:11,533
Then I'll take blue.

734
00:56:13,400 --> 00:56:15,500
All right.

735
00:56:17,033 --> 00:56:19,267
Should we use a big one?

736
00:56:22,500 --> 00:56:24,433
How could someone doodle like this?

737
00:56:24,433 --> 00:56:27,433
I know. Students these days are so scary.

738
00:56:27,433 --> 00:56:29,933
- They are so mean. 
 - This bad thing…

739
00:56:30,367 --> 00:56:32,100
It's all done.

740
00:56:32,750 --> 00:56:34,980
All done.

741
00:56:43,790 --> 00:56:45,550
Keep going.

742
00:57:11,800 --> 00:57:18,000
♫  The day when it becomes dazzlingly bright  ♫

743
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:26,067
♫  Even if your steps are still heavy  ♫

744
00:57:26,067 --> 00:57:32,400
♫  I will be by your side, as if it's fate  ♫

745
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:40,633
♫  In sleep, and even in dreams  ♫

746
00:57:40,633 --> 00:57:46,033
♫  I will protect you  ♫

747
00:57:46,033 --> 00:57:51,567
This is… I feel proud.

748
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:59,600
Wait, my cell phone!

749
00:57:59,600 --> 00:58:01,267
I think I left it behind. I'll bring it right away.

750
00:58:01,267 --> 00:58:03,300
- Yes. 
 - Just a moment, one minute!

751
00:58:03,300 --> 00:58:05,570
One minute.

752
00:58:05,570 --> 00:58:10,960
♫  What you see if what you get  ♫

753
00:58:10,967 --> 00:58:13,200
Starting now, one minute!

754
00:58:14,300 --> 00:58:18,333
 It can't possibly be. 

755
00:58:18,333 --> 00:58:21,033
 It musn't be. 

756
00:58:21,033 --> 00:58:24,533
 Because the me he sees isn't real. 

757
00:58:24,533 --> 00:58:29,400
Ju Yeon, I found it.

758
00:58:31,833 --> 00:58:33,933
 I should check. 

759
00:58:33,933 --> 00:58:38,133
 Let's find out my true feelings about him. 

760
00:58:41,610 --> 00:58:50,540


761
00:58:55,300 --> 00:59:00,367
♫  I start and end every day alone  ♫

762
00:59:00,367 --> 00:59:04,367
♫  The warmth of you goes around  ♫

763
00:59:04,367 --> 00:59:08,567
♫  If only we could be peaceful  ♫

764
00:59:08,567 --> 00:59:12,333
♫  And beautiful by those words   ♫

765
00:59:12,333 --> 00:59:19,100
♫  It's you  ♫

766
00:59:20,733 --> 00:59:27,767
♫  It's you  ♫

767
00:59:29,133 --> 00:59:35,733
♫  It's you  ♫

768
00:59:37,400 --> 00:59:44,267
♫  It's you  ♫

769
00:59:45,267 --> 00:59:50,400
♫  I start and end every day alone  ♫

770
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:54,500
♫  The warmth of you goes around  ♫

771
00:59:54,500 --> 00:59:58,667
♫  If only we could be peaceful  ♫

772
00:59:58,667 --> 01:00:04,133
♫  And beautiful by those words   ♫

773
01:00:04,133 --> 01:00:09,133
   

774
01:00:09,133 --> 01:00:11,467
 Ah, what should I do? I can't look at his face. 

775
01:00:11,467 --> 01:00:14,167
 Since it's for work, let's get in my car. 

776
01:00:14,167 --> 01:00:15,267
 Would you like to take my car? 

777
01:00:15,267 --> 01:00:17,433
 Hurry and get in! Hurry! 

778
01:00:17,433 --> 01:00:19,433
 If I get caught, I won't be able to come back to Korea. 

779
01:00:19,433 --> 01:00:21,033
 It's all for you. 

780
01:00:21,033 --> 01:00:22,933
 Snap out of it, Kyeong Ju Yeon. 

781
01:00:22,933 --> 01:00:26,500
 Why did you bring Jeon Sae Yan? 

782
01:00:26,500 --> 01:00:29,533
 I'll sacrifice myself if I can just block your way. 

783
01:00:29,533 --> 01:00:32,533
 You've been sensitive, and a bit annoyed with me all day. 

784
01:00:32,533 --> 01:00:33,967
 There is a large temperature difference in the mountains. 

785
01:00:33,967 --> 01:00:37,900
 You know what to do in case you end up alone in the mountains. Right? 

786
01:00:37,900 --> 01:00:41,367
 All my attention is focused on this person.
