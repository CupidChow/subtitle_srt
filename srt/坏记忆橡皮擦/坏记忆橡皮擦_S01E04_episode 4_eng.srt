00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:18,380

00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:23,250
   

5
00:00:25,433 --> 00:00:33,300
   

6
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:39,367
   

7
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:49,860


8
00:00:54,567 --> 00:00:55,900
Hands off.

9
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:57,867
I said hands off!

10
00:00:57,867 --> 00:01:01,133
- Why are you doing this? 
 - What are you doing?

11
00:01:01,133 --> 00:01:02,900
Get your hands off her.

12
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:05,100
Senior!

13
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:08,000
Seriously, what's wrong with you?

14
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,267
Never put your hands on me again.

15
00:01:10,267 --> 00:01:11,933
Patient,

16
00:01:11,933 --> 00:01:14,500
Ju Yeon said no.

17
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:15,633
I'm warning you.

18
00:01:15,633 --> 00:01:17,033
If you bother her again…

19
00:01:17,033 --> 00:01:19,133
Then what?

20
00:01:20,833 --> 00:01:23,467
We'll change your doctor.

21
00:01:23,467 --> 00:01:25,767
With whose permission?

22
00:01:26,733 --> 00:01:30,700
Just let it go, Senior.

23
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:32,833
Let's get out of here.

24
00:01:33,333 --> 00:01:34,767
Senior, let's go and eat.

25
00:01:34,767 --> 00:01:37,400
I haven't eaten all day.

26
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,000
Ju Yeon,

27
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,800
can Dr. Yeo work for me today?

28
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:45,067
Dr. Yeo? She has to work overtime tonight.

29
00:01:45,067 --> 00:01:47,567
Can you take over for Dr. Yeo?

30
00:01:47,567 --> 00:01:50,200
If you need me to, I guess it can't be helped.

31
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:54,367
Really? Then please. See you tomorrow.

32
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:00,933
- Let's go. 
 - Let go.

33
00:02:00,933 --> 00:02:02,667
Go tell him you can't do it.

34
00:02:02,667 --> 00:02:03,833
Let go.

35
00:02:03,833 --> 00:02:05,433
Even if it's not your job,

36
00:02:05,433 --> 00:02:08,200
are you still going to do it because he asked you to do it?

37
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:11,100
Just don't do it.

38
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:13,700
Don't even listen to him.

39
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:16,567
You're stepping on the line right now.

40
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:20,067
You're about to cross the line.

41
00:02:22,233 --> 00:02:24,700
Don't cross it or step on the line. Do not do anything.

42
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:26,633
Don't even say it's for my sake.

43
00:02:26,633 --> 00:02:30,233
It's just to fulfill your own desire.

44
00:02:32,033 --> 00:02:34,333
Leave me alone!

45
00:02:42,967 --> 00:02:45,767
Being cold like this,

46
00:02:46,433 --> 00:02:48,633
do you feel better?

47
00:02:49,433 --> 00:02:52,467
Cold temperature. That's me.

48
00:02:52,467 --> 00:02:54,867
Don't come any closer.

49
00:02:55,467 --> 00:02:57,567
Meet a warm person.

50
00:02:57,567 --> 00:03:01,300
Stop clinging to the past.

51
00:03:04,233 --> 00:03:12,633
♫  Being together with the worries that cling to me  ♫

52
00:03:12,633 --> 00:03:16,900
♫  Makes the dark night even darker  ♫

53
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:21,033
♫  Always  ♫

54
00:03:21,033 --> 00:03:27,067
♫  As the day sets, it's still breaking  ♫

55
00:03:27,067 --> 00:03:29,600
Let's do it.

56
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:37,433
♫  The only thing that shines through these repeating days  ♫

57
00:03:37,433 --> 00:03:44,267
♫  It's you  ♫

58
00:03:45,767 --> 00:03:52,900
♫  It's you  ♫

59
00:03:54,100 --> 00:04:00,867
♫  It's you  ♫

60
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:09,600
♫  It's you  ♫

61
00:04:19,067 --> 00:04:25,200
   

62
00:04:36,567 --> 00:04:39,133
   

63
00:04:39,933 --> 00:04:43,300
He told me to buy him coffee.

64
00:04:46,267 --> 00:04:49,167
He must have put it here just before.

65
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,333
   

66
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:04,600
What? Is it because I didn't get enough sleep?

67
00:05:14,133 --> 00:05:17,300
 Soon, I'm going to make 

68
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:22,500
 your eyes look like this. 

69
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,233
Oh, yes.

70
00:05:54,333 --> 00:05:55,800
   

71
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:58,067
Okay.

72
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:16,800
Cola.

73
00:06:17,967 --> 00:06:21,533
Why are you in the garden? Were you kicked out?

74
00:06:21,533 --> 00:06:24,200
What happened?

75
00:06:29,267 --> 00:06:31,733
Did you sneak out again?

76
00:06:31,733 --> 00:06:33,700
Why did you throw Cola into the garden?

77
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:36,600
Because it keeps growling at its master.

78
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:39,267
I can't go out.

79
00:06:42,067 --> 00:06:45,333
The dog should go out.

80
00:06:52,964 --> 00:06:53,867
Thank you.

81
00:06:53,867 --> 00:06:55,800
Why is the room so messy?

82
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:58,167
I thought we had been robbed.

83
00:06:58,167 --> 00:07:00,833
Why are you walking around in my clothes like a thief?

84
00:07:00,833 --> 00:07:02,767
Take them off right now.

85
00:07:02,767 --> 00:07:04,167
Oh, right.

86
00:07:04,167 --> 00:07:06,300
You took my credit card?

87
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:09,333
You had a big party with takeout food, huh?

88
00:07:09,333 --> 00:07:12,400
Brothers share everything, right?

89
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,233
You called me a thief, right?

90
00:07:14,233 --> 00:07:17,800
You said "Take them off, right now", brother?

91
00:07:18,933 --> 00:07:21,167
By the way,

92
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:22,733
it's weird, right?

93
00:07:22,733 --> 00:07:27,100
I've looked everywhere, but my wallet...

94
00:07:28,633 --> 00:07:31,633
and smartphone are nowhere to be found.

95
00:07:31,633 --> 00:07:33,967
So,

96
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,800
I thought it over.

97
00:07:43,267 --> 00:07:47,133
I'm going to use your card while I wait for my new one.

98
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:52,300
Of course, you would have offered first, brother.

99
00:07:53,233 --> 00:07:55,500
I accept.

100
00:07:59,433 --> 00:08:01,967
Did you tell the hospital you were leaving?

101
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:10,400
Yes, Professor Han.

102
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:14,933
He's at home, but he insists on going out.

103
00:08:14,933 --> 00:08:17,033
Yes.

104
00:08:18,233 --> 00:08:20,500
I'll take care of it.

105
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,933
I've called Guk Bong.

106
00:08:22,933 --> 00:08:25,933
I've asked him to make sure nothing goes wrong.

107
00:08:25,933 --> 00:08:29,000
I'm so sorry.

108
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,533
Hey.

109
00:08:33,533 --> 00:08:35,800
Why didn't you come in?

110
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:38,067
Well, just…

111
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:49,100
What, why? What for?

112
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:51,233
Hey, follow me.

113
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:56,810
­Not you.

114
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,700
This one?

115
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:01,667
That one?

116
00:09:01,667 --> 00:09:04,067
Not that one?

117
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,567
What, this one?

118
00:09:06,567 --> 00:09:09,833
Okay, I've decided.

119
00:09:09,833 --> 00:09:11,967
What?

120
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:17,400
The weather is great and the breeze is nice too.

121
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,800
Why choose this car out of so many?

122
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:23,367
With me behind the wheel, any classic car looks like a supercar.

123
00:09:23,367 --> 00:09:26,100
A supercar? More like a piece of junk.

124
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:28,533
Yeah, nice work.

125
00:09:28,533 --> 00:09:31,300
Oh my. It's really embarrassing.

126
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:35,533
All right, Guk Bong, let's go check it out.

127
00:09:36,867 --> 00:09:39,667
 Please leave a message after the beep… 

128
00:09:39,667 --> 00:09:42,967
Not answering my call?

129
00:09:57,067 --> 00:09:58,833
Back in my day,

130
00:09:58,833 --> 00:10:00,700
you know feature phones, Seung Hyeon?

131
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:01,900
That's all we had.

132
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:05,433
 The semi-finals of the Korean Tennis Championship will be broadcast soon. 

133
00:10:05,433 --> 00:10:07,767
That's… Seung Hyeon. It's live, isn't it?

134
00:10:07,767 --> 00:10:09,367
- It's… 
  - Top seed player Lee Shin and 

135
00:10:09,367 --> 00:10:11,233
 third seed player Kim Seong Jong. 

136
00:10:11,233 --> 00:10:13,200
Oh, right!

137
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,400
Seung Hyeon can't be alone.

138
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,767
My auntie called, and she's coming back.

139
00:10:17,767 --> 00:10:19,033
Just go.

140
00:10:19,033 --> 00:10:20,633
Ju Yeon is coming back?

141
00:10:20,633 --> 00:10:22,100
Did she work all night again?

142
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:24,300
I want to see her.

143
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:28,667
 Kim Seong Jong must be under a lot of pressure. 

144
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:33,700
Ma'am!

145
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:34,767
Ta-da, I brought some cans.

146
00:10:34,767 --> 00:10:37,767
I told you it's okay. Why did you come out again?

147
00:10:37,767 --> 00:10:42,767
If they find this at home, the landlady will be mad at me.

148
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:44,733
No one knows I'm a heavy drinker.

149
00:10:44,733 --> 00:10:47,133
Did you really drink all that by yourself?

150
00:10:47,133 --> 00:10:49,233
- Yes. 
 - Wow.

151
00:10:49,233 --> 00:10:51,400
You've got quite an appetite for a little lady.

152
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,033
I just had a little drink, nothing more.

153
00:10:53,033 --> 00:10:55,367
Ma'am! I have things to do today,

154
00:10:55,367 --> 00:10:57,767
so I can't help you with that.

155
00:10:57,767 --> 00:11:00,567
I'm sorry, but there's no one to talk to today.

156
00:11:00,567 --> 00:11:02,367
It's okay, just go.

157
00:11:02,367 --> 00:11:04,633
I'm leaving now. Take care.

158
00:11:04,633 --> 00:11:06,450
Bye.

159
00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:09,100
 ­  

160
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:11,500
Ma'am!

161
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,367
I'll do it.

162
00:11:13,367 --> 00:11:15,533
- No, it's okay. 
 - Like this,

163
00:11:15,533 --> 00:11:19,433
and then, ta-da, like this!

164
00:11:27,567 --> 00:11:28,600
Oh, my.

165
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:31,433
You're standing right in front of the trash can.

166
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,367
Oh my. Don't pick it up.

167
00:11:35,367 --> 00:11:37,933
You'll ruin your pretty hands.

168
00:11:38,467 --> 00:11:39,567
Okay.

169
00:11:39,567 --> 00:11:41,167
It looked like you needed that.

170
00:11:41,167 --> 00:11:42,900
Hey, you want to hang out with us?

171
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:44,533
What are you saying?

172
00:11:44,533 --> 00:11:47,033
Should I sew your mouths up?

173
00:11:47,033 --> 00:11:48,567
Grandma, stay out of this!

174
00:11:48,567 --> 00:11:50,533
Or what, just you and us, 2 on 2?

175
00:11:50,533 --> 00:11:53,867
Ma'am, let's just ignore them.

176
00:11:53,867 --> 00:11:56,067
Let's just go.

177
00:12:00,267 --> 00:12:02,400
Sis!

178
00:12:15,567 --> 00:12:17,033
Who left the table like this?

179
00:12:17,033 --> 00:12:19,333
The pretty auntie.

180
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:24,167
Seung Hyeon, the game…

181
00:12:31,667 --> 00:12:35,200
Staying in someone else's room, but won't bother to clean up before leaving?

182
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:38,100
At least clean up after staying, right?

183
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:42,133
Being nice to others, but why make trouble for the ones around her?

184
00:12:47,633 --> 00:12:50,533
Should I just rest for five minutes?

185
00:12:50,533 --> 00:12:53,200
All right, five minutes.

186
00:12:53,967 --> 00:12:57,067
So comfortable.

187
00:12:58,067 --> 00:13:02,167
What is that, an aroma scent?

188
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,600
No.

189
00:13:09,267 --> 00:13:12,067
I shouldn't fall sleep.

190
00:13:12,067 --> 00:13:17,033
 This is the Tennis Stadium, home of the Korean Tennis Championships. 

191
00:13:17,033 --> 00:13:18,800
 The semi-finals of the tennis championship, 

192
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:22,900
 featuring Lee Shin, are coming up. 

193
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:25,000
It's player Lee Shin!

194
00:13:26,767 --> 00:13:28,367
Yes, here, please.

195
00:13:28,367 --> 00:13:30,867
Lee Shin, what are your goals for the semi-finals?

196
00:13:30,867 --> 00:13:33,567
I'm Lee Shin's father, thank you.

197
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:35,900
   

198
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:37,000
Honey.

199
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
One moment.

200
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,767
What are you doing in front of the journalists?

201
00:13:40,767 --> 00:13:42,933
I'm Hong Ji Man from Big Picture Agency.

202
00:13:42,933 --> 00:13:44,367
I'll take questions.

203
00:13:44,367 --> 00:13:47,067
- Who's first? 
- How is Lee Shin's condition?

204
00:13:47,067 --> 00:13:48,600
Pretty good, next.

205
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,300
The player, Lee Shin.

206
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:53,100
He looks a little bit nervous for a world-class player.

207
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:54,333
Oh, yes.

208
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:57,867
Isn't he famous for his poker face during matches?

209
00:13:57,867 --> 00:14:01,833
I'm really looking forward to seeing what kind of game Lee Shin will play.

210
00:14:01,833 --> 00:14:04,100
   

211
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:08,200
It's brand-new, try them on.

212
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:10,433
New shoes are uncomfortable because they are not worn in.

213
00:14:10,433 --> 00:14:14,200
You should've given them to him earlier so he could get used to them.

214
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:17,033
Since these shoes are tailored for Shin,

215
00:14:17,033 --> 00:14:19,000
- there won't be any discomfort. 
 - No way.

216
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:23,400
If he gets blisters, he won't be able to play any matches for a while.

217
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:24,400
Honey.

218
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:27,200
The rehab coach wants to see you.

219
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,300
Yeah.

220
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,033
Shin, just try them on.

221
00:14:39,033 --> 00:14:41,567
No way.

222
00:14:41,567 --> 00:14:44,367
What if I get blisters?

223
00:14:44,367 --> 00:14:48,867
Is there anything more important than a sponsor?

224
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:51,900
It sounds like it's more about the money rather than my exercise.

225
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:54,767
You can't do sports without money.

226
00:14:56,700 --> 00:15:01,067
We need money to keep your secrets.

227
00:15:07,333 --> 00:15:09,800
Oh, Lee Kun!

228
00:15:11,667 --> 00:15:16,433
So, how's the contract forour national fairy, Cha Si On?

229
00:15:16,433 --> 00:15:18,067
The little girl?

230
00:15:18,067 --> 00:15:21,800
I heard she's here for a lesson on the next court, so I came to see you.

231
00:15:23,467 --> 00:15:26,000
Try showing off your skills.

232
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:30,467
If I bring you the signed contract, you have to keep your promise.

233
00:15:30,467 --> 00:15:33,400
Of course, don't worry.

234
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,500
So simple.

235
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:47,333
Is your pot okay?

236
00:15:47,333 --> 00:15:49,967
It's not a pot, it's a skull…

237
00:15:49,967 --> 00:15:52,000
No.

238
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,633
Head.

239
00:15:53,633 --> 00:15:54,800
Don't worry about it.

240
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:57,533
You said you'd come yesterday, and I've been waiting.

241
00:15:57,533 --> 00:16:00,400
They do say distance makes the heart grow fonder.

242
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:04,533
Also, I'm here to discuss a contract with Big Picture Agency.

243
00:16:04,533 --> 00:16:07,100
I thought you came to see me.

244
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:10,300
I'm not sure if the agency is worth it.

245
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:13,900
Why not? A lot of perks.

246
00:16:15,533 --> 00:16:17,467
I am here.

247
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:20,100
I'm close by.

248
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:22,033
And...

249
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:25,200
I'm there.

250
00:16:27,633 --> 00:16:29,800
My wish was to play tennis with you.

251
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:31,667
Would you like to try?

252
00:16:31,667 --> 00:16:34,067
- A rally? 
 - We'll be in a team.

253
00:16:34,067 --> 00:16:38,900
If we win at least one set, I'll sign the contract.

254
00:16:40,367 --> 00:16:43,633
You should keep your promise.

255
00:16:45,633 --> 00:16:47,770
Fine.

256
00:16:47,770 --> 00:16:50,610
 ­  

257
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:53,930
 ­  

258
00:17:07,633 --> 00:17:09,000
Swag.

259
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,133
Let's start.

260
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:29,100
Okay, who will serve? Heads or tails?

261
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:31,233
Heads.

262
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,133
Heads.

263
00:17:37,033 --> 00:17:41,133
This guy hasn't played in over 10 years, but he's still in great shape.

264
00:17:41,133 --> 00:17:43,400
Lee Kun, let's go!

265
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:47,050
 ­  

266
00:17:47,050 --> 00:17:49,000
 ­  

267
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,233
Sorry.

268
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:17,000
Maybe it's because this racket isn't mine?

269
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,733
- Gosh… 
 - Oh, my…

270
00:18:30,090 --> 00:18:31,050
 ­  

271
00:18:37,470 --> 00:18:39,340
 ­  

272
00:18:56,967 --> 00:18:58,100
Don't worry.

273
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:00,500
We can do this.

274
00:19:12,267 --> 00:19:14,367
Okay.

275
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:25,660
 ­  

276
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:32,290
 ­  

277
00:19:33,330 --> 00:19:35,590
 ­  

278
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:04,467
Mine, mine, mine, mine!

279
00:20:31,733 --> 00:20:34,167
It's after 1:00 p.m.

280
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:40,500
I was asleep for too long.

281
00:20:43,233 --> 00:20:46,333
Professor, have you started the consultation with Mr. Lee?

282
00:20:46,333 --> 00:20:50,167
 I postponed it since the subject is going to Shin's tournament. 

283
00:20:50,167 --> 00:20:52,667
You gave him permission to go out?

284
00:20:52,667 --> 00:20:56,033
 It'll be all right because a friend is there as the guardian. 

285
00:20:56,033 --> 00:20:58,700
We don't know who he might be mean there, how you can just let him go?

286
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:00,933
Even with a guardian, it's a concern.

287
00:21:00,933 --> 00:21:02,600
I'll go myself.

288
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:04,567
Let's go.

289
00:21:04,567 --> 00:21:05,633
Go, go.

290
00:21:05,633 --> 00:21:08,467
   

291
00:21:08,467 --> 00:21:09,600
 Where are you? 

292
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:12,033
I'm exercising.

293
00:21:12,033 --> 00:21:15,400
Seung Hyeon's alone. I told you not to leave him alone.

294
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:20,000
No, Sae Yan said she'd take care of Seung Hyeon.

295
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,500
No. She went out and left the kid alone.

296
00:21:25,833 --> 00:21:29,233
When's she going back to Italy? Seriously.

297
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:36,567
Hello?

298
00:21:36,567 --> 00:21:38,367
Mom.

299
00:21:38,367 --> 00:21:40,700
No, I'm outside the house.

300
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:44,367
Hang up.

301
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:51,367
Ugh, now I'll have to spend more money on medications.

302
00:21:55,267 --> 00:21:57,567
Are you laughing?

303
00:22:16,033 --> 00:22:20,167
No, who doodled on this?

304
00:22:20,167 --> 00:22:21,933
No, it's…

305
00:22:21,933 --> 00:22:23,233
It wasn't me!

306
00:22:23,233 --> 00:22:27,067
Are you an event staffer by any chance?

307
00:22:27,067 --> 00:22:28,833
Let's talk for a moment.

308
00:22:28,833 --> 00:22:30,967
What?

309
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,133
As I don't have a mirror.

310
00:22:34,133 --> 00:22:36,833
Let's see.

311
00:22:37,833 --> 00:22:40,300
Even soaked in sweat,

312
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:41,533
I'm still perfect.

313
00:22:41,533 --> 00:22:43,667
Please continue.

314
00:22:47,267 --> 00:22:48,500
Is he crazy?

315
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:50,900
Huh? Well, by any chance.

316
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:54,467
Where should I go to meet player Lee Shin?

317
00:22:58,233 --> 00:23:00,233
You see, it's an interesting story...

318
00:23:00,233 --> 00:23:02,833
No, please listen to me…

319
00:23:02,833 --> 00:23:04,267
Hey, Lee Shin!

320
00:23:04,267 --> 00:23:05,467
Come out now!

321
00:23:05,467 --> 00:23:07,100
Can you please listen to my story once?

322
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:10,133
Please, I beg you!

323
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:13,233
Good job!

324
00:23:13,233 --> 00:23:14,767
I told you it would work. Great job.

325
00:23:14,767 --> 00:23:17,533
Why is your performance like this, huh?

326
00:23:17,533 --> 00:23:21,100
I told you to check the kid's condition the day before.

327
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:23,567
That…

328
00:23:23,567 --> 00:23:25,333
Shin.

329
00:23:25,333 --> 00:23:27,433
What happened? You're slow.

330
00:23:27,433 --> 00:23:29,533
Where does it hurt?

331
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:33,367
No.

332
00:23:33,367 --> 00:23:37,267
But he won the game.

333
00:23:37,267 --> 00:23:39,300
Frankly, did Shin do well?

334
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:42,133
The opponent didn't perform well.

335
00:23:43,067 --> 00:23:44,800
Tomorrow is the final game.

336
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:48,467
I'm unhappy with everything including his schedule management.

337
00:23:48,467 --> 00:23:51,467
That… I have sent all reporters back,

338
00:23:51,467 --> 00:23:54,433
so that he could put his all into the final.

339
00:23:57,133 --> 00:23:58,900
Shin.

340
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:02,367
Just push a little more, all right?

341
00:24:02,367 --> 00:24:04,233
For your reputation.

342
00:24:04,233 --> 00:24:07,233
 You can't let people down. 

343
00:24:07,967 --> 00:24:10,600
 I'll do better tomorrow. 

344
00:24:24,067 --> 00:24:26,700
Excuse me…

345
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:28,700
Isn't Lee Kun in the locker room?

346
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:32,333
Lee Kun? He left earlier.

347
00:24:32,333 --> 00:24:34,500
I see.

348
00:24:39,567 --> 00:24:41,867
Oh my.

349
00:24:57,367 --> 00:24:59,600
Apparently, he went back to the hospital.

350
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:00,967
From now on,

351
00:25:00,967 --> 00:25:03,633
please let me know even though he already told you.

352
00:25:03,633 --> 00:25:06,600
What if something happens to him?

353
00:25:07,567 --> 00:25:10,800
See you at the hospital. Bye.

354
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:14,300
Yes, this is Kyeong Ju Yeon.

355
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:17,600
Yes, I've sent the materials to the Ministry of Science via email.

356
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:20,400
If you need any information, I'll send it to you.

357
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:23,167
Yes, take care.

358
00:25:23,667 --> 00:25:25,867
Any anti-drowsiness gum?

359
00:25:25,867 --> 00:25:29,200
She's leading a really exhausting life.

360
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:35,100
Take care.

361
00:25:39,067 --> 00:25:41,367
My apologies…

362
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:44,600
Lee Shin?

363
00:25:45,367 --> 00:25:47,667
My eggs.

364
00:25:49,033 --> 00:25:51,500
Are you all right?

365
00:25:52,233 --> 00:25:54,500
No.

366
00:25:57,133 --> 00:26:00,100
I'm not in a good mental state.

367
00:26:07,967 --> 00:26:11,633
Oh, that jinx?

368
00:26:11,633 --> 00:26:15,067
There's a final match tomorrow,

369
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:18,900
and since an egg broke, I'm going to break too.

370
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:21,500
It's all just superstition.

371
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:24,767
If I lose the finals, the prize will be 100 million won.

372
00:26:24,767 --> 00:26:26,700
Wow, 100 million won.

373
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:30,200
Every time I lost a competition,

374
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:33,967
with 10,000 fans leaving,

375
00:26:34,433 --> 00:26:37,567
in ads and sponsorships,

376
00:26:37,567 --> 00:26:39,867
the loss is around

377
00:26:39,867 --> 00:26:42,100
1 billion won?

378
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:44,367
Oh, 1 billion won?

379
00:26:44,367 --> 00:26:46,700
If I get injured and break down,

380
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:49,467
it means the end of my sports career.

381
00:26:49,467 --> 00:26:50,833
Wait a minute.

382
00:26:50,833 --> 00:26:54,867
Do you really believe that just because one egg is broken, it will be that bad?

383
00:26:54,867 --> 00:26:57,767
You said I have OCD.

384
00:26:57,767 --> 00:26:59,967
Of course, it's a jinx.

385
00:26:59,967 --> 00:27:02,300
It's all psychological.

386
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:03,767
I'll take care of all the things.

387
00:27:03,767 --> 00:27:08,300
Since I don't have time, let's do some counseling on the way to the hospital…

388
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:10,100
Are you hurt? Apply some ointment first.

389
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:11,433
Apply it?

390
00:27:11,433 --> 00:27:12,967
Does that mean I'll lose tomorrow?

391
00:27:12,967 --> 00:27:16,067
No, shake off such thoughts.

392
00:27:16,067 --> 00:27:17,300
Shake them off?

393
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:21,033
Does that mean I'll be shaken off tomorrow?

394
00:27:23,533 --> 00:27:25,633
Oh my.

395
00:27:30,733 --> 00:27:33,067
Is this really the jinx-breaking routine?

396
00:27:33,067 --> 00:27:34,367
Eating rose tteokbokki?

397
00:27:34,367 --> 00:27:36,033
Eat it before it gets cold, okay?

398
00:27:36,033 --> 00:27:38,167
I feel dizzy, quickly.

399
00:27:38,167 --> 00:27:40,267
Okay.

400
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:46,133
How is it?

401
00:27:46,133 --> 00:27:47,967
Taste good?

402
00:27:47,967 --> 00:27:50,033
- Texture? 
 - Just so-so.

403
00:27:50,033 --> 00:27:52,867
Sweet and spicy.

404
00:27:54,333 --> 00:27:57,300
That's all? Why describe the taste that simply?

405
00:27:57,300 --> 00:28:00,667
I'm not the type to eat something delicious and get all excited about it.

406
00:28:00,667 --> 00:28:04,100
I just grab a bite at a convenience store.

407
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:06,900
That's why you're so thin.

408
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:09,300
I think the only people who haven't tried rose tteokbokki

409
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:11,200
are you and me.

410
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,667
What?

411
00:28:12,667 --> 00:28:14,300
Then, haven't you eaten this?

412
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:17,133
You said it's a jinx-breaking routine?

413
00:28:18,767 --> 00:28:20,433
Well…

414
00:28:20,433 --> 00:28:22,967
I eat it with my eyes.

415
00:28:22,967 --> 00:28:24,667
Second-hand satisfaction.

416
00:28:24,667 --> 00:28:26,833
It's fine now, right?

417
00:28:26,833 --> 00:28:29,850
The jinx is broken, right?

418
00:28:29,850 --> 00:28:31,600
♫  Oh yeah  ♫

419
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:35,160
Mint chocolate croffle?

420
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:38,810
♫  I don't want to have to say it  ♫

421
00:28:38,810 --> 00:28:48,290
♫  I want you to understand without me having to say anything  ♫

422
00:28:48,290 --> 00:28:54,667
♫  Sure, we're clumsy right now  ♫

423
00:28:54,667 --> 00:28:57,167
Better than I thought…

424
00:28:57,167 --> 00:28:59,300
It's delicious, isn't it?

425
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:03,833
On cheat day, I'm going to eat all of this.

426
00:29:03,833 --> 00:29:05,567
Self-management.

427
00:29:05,567 --> 00:29:08,867
That's what you want right? Not other people.

428
00:29:08,867 --> 00:29:11,000
It seems you always live by other people's standards,

429
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,933
not your own.

430
00:29:12,933 --> 00:29:14,333
Time for self-reflection?

431
00:29:14,333 --> 00:29:15,867
That's a bit of a luxury talk.

432
00:29:15,867 --> 00:29:19,433
Isn't it that you don't know how, not that you don't have time?

433
00:29:19,433 --> 00:29:21,567
You either don't examine what you want

434
00:29:21,567 --> 00:29:25,467
or you don't know how to.

435
00:29:26,167 --> 00:29:28,800
Is it the former or the latter?

436
00:29:33,933 --> 00:29:35,567
What are you suddenly doing?

437
00:29:35,567 --> 00:29:37,433
It's time for me to exercise.

438
00:29:37,433 --> 00:29:39,600
Aren't you going to get up?

439
00:29:40,067 --> 00:29:41,767
Looks tasty.

440
00:29:41,767 --> 00:29:44,067
Okay, everybody, dive in.

441
00:29:44,067 --> 00:29:46,633
Here.

442
00:29:46,633 --> 00:29:48,400
Shall I?

443
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:51,067
If I leave food, I'll be punished. Right?

444
00:29:51,067 --> 00:29:53,933
- For sure.
 - Just get scolded once by Elsa.

445
00:29:53,933 --> 00:29:55,567
Thank you for the meal.

446
00:29:55,567 --> 00:29:58,700
Help yourselves to as much as you like.

447
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:02,433
The side dishes are tasty, so enjoy them.

448
00:30:06,633 --> 00:30:08,433
That necklace

449
00:30:08,433 --> 00:30:12,000
is beautiful, the Eiffel Tower design.

450
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,967
Oh, yes.

451
00:30:13,967 --> 00:30:18,200
I had an Eiffel Tower key ring in my drawer, but it's gone now.

452
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:19,833
Did you take it by any chance?

453
00:30:19,833 --> 00:30:23,833
Do you still keep the key ring that Dr. Te Oh gave you? I threw it away a long time ago.

454
00:30:23,833 --> 00:30:25,167
It stinks of iron.

455
00:30:25,167 --> 00:30:29,433
It's strange. It was there just a few days ago.

456
00:30:29,433 --> 00:30:34,200
You saw it back then too, didn't you, Lee Kun?

457
00:30:37,667 --> 00:30:39,133
I'd like to take you back,

458
00:30:39,133 --> 00:30:43,000
but I have to go running. Wait a sec.

459
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:46,800
I'll call a taxi myself.

460
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:51,700
Thanks to you, I had a great time.

461
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:54,867
I even tried rose tteokbokki and mint chocolate.

462
00:30:54,867 --> 00:30:58,867
I haven't brushed my teeth, but I feel really refreshed.

463
00:30:58,867 --> 00:31:02,367
I've achieved my goal today.

464
00:31:02,367 --> 00:31:03,667
Breaking the jinx?

465
00:31:03,667 --> 00:31:05,400
Making you laugh.

466
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:06,800
Boosting your mood.

467
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:08,333
Getting you to eat a meal.

468
00:31:08,333 --> 00:31:11,320
I was worried because you didn't look happy.

469
00:31:13,233 --> 00:31:15,567
Why are you always focused on other's feelings?

470
00:31:15,567 --> 00:31:18,367
Doesn't your own mood matter?

471
00:31:21,167 --> 00:31:24,000
Your mood doesn't seem to be very good.

472
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,933
At the locker room.

473
00:31:26,933 --> 00:31:29,500
You did a great job.

474
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,633
Even though I'm not familiar with the game,

475
00:31:38,633 --> 00:31:41,167
I watched your game in awe.

476
00:31:41,167 --> 00:31:44,167
It seemed to be played really well.

477
00:31:44,167 --> 00:31:46,300
Bye.

478
00:31:48,433 --> 00:31:51,967
Is that a compliment?

479
00:31:58,967 --> 00:32:01,833
 Ju Yeon! 

480
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:06,233
Why? Did you forget something?

481
00:32:06,233 --> 00:32:08,333
Yes, taking you home.

482
00:32:08,333 --> 00:32:10,900
I can go alone. Or you can get in.

483
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:13,300
No. I'm supposed to be running now.

484
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:15,400
Oh, watch out.

485
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:18,700
I'm okay.

486
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:20,200
You'll get hurt.

487
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:24,000
Don't talk to me. I'm out of breath.

488
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:28,433
Sir, please slow down a bit. Thank you.

489
00:32:29,767 --> 00:32:32,260
Be careful over there.

490
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:35,760
♫  Running backwards to you  ♫

491
00:32:38,650 --> 00:32:46,730
♫  Drowning, drowning in an ocean of grey  ♫

492
00:32:46,733 --> 00:32:49,800
   

493
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:58,950
♫  Running, running backwards to you  ♫

494
00:33:03,567 --> 00:33:05,300
I'll pay for this.

495
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:08,200
- Okay. 
 - Thank you.

496
00:33:14,767 --> 00:33:16,867
Safe!

497
00:33:17,633 --> 00:33:22,567
Catching up to a taxi like this, no wonder you're world-class.

498
00:33:22,567 --> 00:33:24,900
Come on, this is nothing.

499
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:27,500
Thank you for bringing me home.

500
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:29,800
You have something on your face…

501
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:31,933
On my face?

502
00:33:32,467 --> 00:33:34,000
Where? What is it?

503
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,100
Just a little down… No.

504
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:36,367
Here?

505
00:33:36,367 --> 00:33:37,533
What is it?

506
00:33:37,533 --> 00:33:39,567
Just a moment.

507
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:49,300
Done.

508
00:33:55,467 --> 00:33:57,067
   

509
00:33:57,067 --> 00:33:58,700
What?

510
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:00,900
What's wrong?

511
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:04,033
Nothing, someone might have eaten beef…

512
00:34:05,633 --> 00:34:08,567
or bought a calf.

513
00:34:09,367 --> 00:34:11,600
Oh, the finals are tomorrow, right?

514
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:13,967
I'll cheer for you.

515
00:34:16,667 --> 00:34:18,867
Bye.

516
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,833
   

517
00:34:28,833 --> 00:34:31,200
Again?

518
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:34,667
This is crazy.

519
00:34:34,667 --> 00:34:37,467
I'll think of you as my big brother from now on.

520
00:34:37,467 --> 00:34:39,500
Thank you.

521
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:43,100
 ♪ K-beef is the best ♪ 

522
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:49,633
Oh, you got the payment notification?

523
00:34:50,367 --> 00:34:52,133
Did you buy a calf or something?

524
00:34:52,133 --> 00:34:55,667
I had my ID and credit card reissued in my name.

525
00:34:55,667 --> 00:34:59,167
but I left those at home.

526
00:34:59,167 --> 00:35:01,133
Now, I don't need your card.

527
00:35:01,133 --> 00:35:04,033
That's good, because I'm at the hospital now.

528
00:35:04,033 --> 00:35:05,500
 Can I take the card, then? 

529
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:07,333
Hospital?

530
00:35:08,433 --> 00:35:10,533
Hey, you…

531
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:12,833
What shall I do?

532
00:35:12,833 --> 00:35:14,600
I'm not at the hospital now.

533
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:17,567
 Oh, right, the key ring. 

534
00:35:17,567 --> 00:35:20,333
Hey, you, the key ring?

535
00:35:20,967 --> 00:35:22,000
Dr. Kyeong.

536
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,200
- Hey. 
 - Why do you have it?

537
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:25,800
Hey.

538
00:35:29,333 --> 00:35:31,833
What? Wa there something?

539
00:35:32,533 --> 00:35:33,967
- Nothing. 
 - Shall we go inside?

540
00:35:33,967 --> 00:35:35,733
Did Lee Kun go in already?

541
00:35:35,733 --> 00:35:38,367
- Is he not here? 
 - Where'd he get to?

542
00:35:38,367 --> 00:35:39,400
Brother?

543
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:41,900
Did you get hurt?

544
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:45,300
It reminds me of the old days. I played a little prank.

545
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:46,767
I'm sorry.

546
00:35:46,767 --> 00:35:49,067
What?

547
00:35:58,067 --> 00:35:59,867
Gosh, you startled me.

548
00:35:59,867 --> 00:36:02,067
Who are you?

549
00:36:02,067 --> 00:36:04,500
Two people sitting under a tree K-I-S-S-I-N-G!

550
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:07,233
Don't worry too much.

551
00:36:07,233 --> 00:36:09,067
I'll keep this secret.

552
00:36:09,067 --> 00:36:12,933
Then, bye-bye.

553
00:36:13,933 --> 00:36:15,767
No, it's not like that!

554
00:36:15,767 --> 00:36:18,900
- Who's that guy? 
 - You said you were not at the hospital.

555
00:36:19,533 --> 00:36:22,167
Oh, right.

556
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:25,233
Give me the key ring.

557
00:36:25,933 --> 00:36:26,967
Is it yours?

558
00:36:26,967 --> 00:36:29,000
Uh, that's mine.

559
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:32,467
No, that's Dr. Song's.

560
00:36:32,467 --> 00:36:34,867
Anyway, just hand it over now.

561
00:36:41,233 --> 00:36:46,100
It's been a while since I've seen real grass instead of artificial turf.

562
00:36:47,967 --> 00:36:51,933
Oh boy, I'm falling down a lot today.

563
00:36:51,933 --> 00:36:54,700
I played tennis for the first time in a while.

564
00:36:55,567 --> 00:36:57,700
Look.

565
00:36:58,267 --> 00:37:01,000
I'm not as good as before.

566
00:37:05,433 --> 00:37:08,167
- Brother. 
 - Yes.

567
00:37:08,867 --> 00:37:11,333
Do you remember our childhood?

568
00:37:12,667 --> 00:37:15,467
I played with my neighborhood friends.

569
00:37:15,467 --> 00:37:18,867
And I cried because I lost,

570
00:37:18,867 --> 00:37:22,000
but then you gave me a shoulder throw.

571
00:37:25,267 --> 00:37:28,767
 Is this tiny piece of land all you're after? 

572
00:37:28,767 --> 00:37:33,767
 Look, you should aim for the sky. 

573
00:37:33,767 --> 00:37:36,767
 The cloud is mine. 

574
00:37:38,167 --> 00:37:40,033
 Then, 

575
00:37:40,033 --> 00:37:43,233
 the other cloud is mine. 

576
00:37:43,233 --> 00:37:45,833
 You can take all the clouds. 

577
00:37:45,833 --> 00:37:48,633
 I'll take the sun. 

578
00:37:50,467 --> 00:37:52,300
 No. 

579
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:54,633
 You take the sun as well. 

580
00:37:56,033 --> 00:37:57,700
 Then, what would you take? 

581
00:37:57,700 --> 00:37:59,833
 I'll take... 

582
00:38:00,633 --> 00:38:02,367
 the universe. 

583
00:38:02,367 --> 00:38:05,100
 I'll be a tennis star. 

584
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:07,533
 You will see. 

585
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:17,800
You're someone who'll be a star of the universe.

586
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:20,967
Your body will remember soon.

587
00:38:20,967 --> 00:38:25,933
Your DNA never loses.

588
00:38:27,533 --> 00:38:30,100
Is there anyone like that?

589
00:38:31,333 --> 00:38:33,600
Winning and losing?

590
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:36,000
So what if you lose?

591
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
Myself at that time,

592
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:41,700
luckily enough,

593
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:44,833
I simply did well at what I enjoy.

594
00:38:44,833 --> 00:38:48,000
Winning is not important.

595
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,300
Really.

596
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:54,100
What's important is doing something that makes you truly happy.

597
00:38:55,467 --> 00:39:00,767
Anyway, I guess I should become a star of the universe. Right?

598
00:39:01,833 --> 00:39:04,067
Then,

599
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:07,533
I'll make it happen,

600
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:11,100
your dream.

601
00:39:11,767 --> 00:39:15,133
Why would you achieve my dream?

602
00:39:15,133 --> 00:39:17,867
You should achieve your own dreams.

603
00:39:19,533 --> 00:39:22,133
We can't get everything.

604
00:39:22,133 --> 00:39:25,500
Work and people.

605
00:39:26,033 --> 00:39:29,400
I just need to understand my feelings

606
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:32,900
and give my best to them.

607
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:40,030
♫  Makes the dark night even darker, always  ♫

608
00:39:40,030 --> 00:39:46,630
 ♫ As the day sets, still breaking ♫ 

609
00:39:46,630 --> 00:39:49,033
Just...

610
00:39:49,033 --> 00:39:51,167
stay within the lines...

611
00:39:52,233 --> 00:39:53,710
without crossing them.

612
00:39:56,500 --> 00:40:01,500
♫  It's you  ♫

613
00:40:01,567 --> 00:40:03,300
Hey.

614
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:06,100
- Hey. 
 - Yes?

615
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:09,000
You've crossed the line.

616
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,700
No, I haven't.

617
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:11,900
Move aside.

618
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:13,067
Move, now.

619
00:40:13,067 --> 00:40:15,033
- Move it. 
 - Don't be close to me.

620
00:40:15,033 --> 00:40:16,800
- Move. 
 - Move away.

621
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:20,233
- Move away. 
 - It hurts.

622
00:40:20,233 --> 00:40:22,167
- Oh my. 
 - How dare you?

623
00:40:22,167 --> 00:40:24,400
Do you know whose clothes these are? Mine.

624
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:27,633
I can buy you 100 suits when I became a star of the universe.

625
00:40:27,633 --> 00:40:29,800
You should wash this one.

626
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:31,967
Like this?

627
00:40:35,267 --> 00:40:37,433
Oh no! It's really…

628
00:40:37,433 --> 00:40:40,033
Oh my.

629
00:40:40,033 --> 00:40:41,633
- That's too bad. 
 - It's okay.

630
00:40:41,633 --> 00:40:44,867
So you got hurt at your part-time job?

631
00:40:44,867 --> 00:40:49,400
What a coincidence to come across Ju Yeon.

632
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:52,567
Still, it's a relief I didn't get caught.

633
00:40:52,567 --> 00:40:56,867
If I'd been caught, things would be chaotic by now.

634
00:40:56,867 --> 00:40:59,267
Why are you not allowed to work part-time?

635
00:40:59,267 --> 00:41:01,300
She doesn't come home often.

636
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:03,167
She's somewhat indifferent.

637
00:41:03,167 --> 00:41:05,800
Disappointed with your sis?

638
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:07,733
It seems like she doesn't like me.

639
00:41:07,733 --> 00:41:10,300
I took care of preparing the food,

640
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:12,567
laid out the blanket for her,

641
00:41:12,567 --> 00:41:16,467
and I even asked Seung Hyeon not to wake her up.

642
00:41:17,767 --> 00:41:19,700
 Sis! 

643
00:41:22,833 --> 00:41:26,200
She's become a completely different person.

644
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:28,333
Back then, she was so kind.

645
00:41:28,333 --> 00:41:32,200
She was the only one who'd reach out first when I was being bullied.

646
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:35,833
She used to make sure everyone got along well.

647
00:41:35,833 --> 00:41:40,000
I thought to myself that I should become just like her when I grew up.

648
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,867
But now,

649
00:41:41,867 --> 00:41:43,800
she's so individualistic,

650
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:46,033
ignoring her family, only caring about work.

651
00:41:46,033 --> 00:41:48,333
She's cold, cynical, blunt, and indifferent.

652
00:41:48,333 --> 00:41:52,100
There's no room to get in, oh my.

653
00:41:57,500 --> 00:42:02,733
She's just pretending.

654
00:42:02,733 --> 00:42:03,933
Pretending?

655
00:42:03,933 --> 00:42:07,333
Even though Ju Yeon seems prickly,

656
00:42:07,333 --> 00:42:11,267
she is actually a very warm-hearted person.

657
00:42:11,267 --> 00:42:14,167
She is exactly like her father.

658
00:42:14,167 --> 00:42:17,433
Her father was also a psychiatrist.

659
00:42:17,433 --> 00:42:21,300
He especially cared deeply for his patients.

660
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,967
That day,

661
00:42:23,967 --> 00:42:27,433
he went out for volunteer work on his day-off.

662
00:42:36,167 --> 00:42:39,267
 Oh my… Dad. 

663
00:42:39,267 --> 00:42:43,667
Ju Yeon witnessed the scene.

664
00:42:47,367 --> 00:42:51,567
The reason why I'm not allowed to work part-time jobs

665
00:42:51,567 --> 00:42:56,767
is that she's worried strange people might harm me.

666
00:42:57,567 --> 00:42:59,567
She said her goal

667
00:42:59,567 --> 00:43:02,967
was not to become like her father.

668
00:43:02,967 --> 00:43:08,067
But where did that get her? She takes after her father in every way.

669
00:43:10,700 --> 00:43:13,467
   

670
00:43:43,267 --> 00:43:45,433
Hmm.

671
00:44:43,580 --> 00:44:47,100
  ­ 

672
00:44:55,933 --> 00:44:58,900
He's sleeping.

673
00:45:07,733 --> 00:45:10,533
Lee Kun, that guy, really.

674
00:45:15,633 --> 00:45:18,267
Great job!

675
00:45:18,267 --> 00:45:21,333
Excellent choice. Pass me over.

676
00:45:21,333 --> 00:45:23,367
Back when I was young,

677
00:45:23,367 --> 00:45:26,900
my coach told me this.

678
00:45:26,900 --> 00:45:31,367
Skill is important, but you can't beat someone with good luck.

679
00:45:31,367 --> 00:45:34,400
Cha Si On, you're so lucky.

680
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:37,000
You've signed a contract with the best agency.

681
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,867
Yes, correct.

682
00:45:38,867 --> 00:45:40,867
It's the best agency.

683
00:45:40,867 --> 00:45:43,267
Why do you say that?

684
00:45:43,267 --> 00:45:45,633
   

685
00:45:45,633 --> 00:45:49,000
Resignation? Stop joking around and bring me the contract.

686
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:52,533
This one? It's our contract.

687
00:45:54,533 --> 00:45:55,800
Your contract?

688
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:59,700
Yes, I opened an agency.

689
00:46:01,033 --> 00:46:02,900
This agency is a monopoly.

690
00:46:02,900 --> 00:46:04,233
So I could

691
00:46:04,233 --> 00:46:07,567
dominate the market.

692
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:12,600
No, hey, who do you think you are…

693
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:14,733
Hey.

694
00:46:14,733 --> 00:46:18,267
Cha Si On, it's not real. Right?

695
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:28,767
I feel completely satisfied.

696
00:46:28,767 --> 00:46:30,067
You planned this?

697
00:46:30,067 --> 00:46:32,500
You.…

698
00:46:33,733 --> 00:46:37,833
What's going on? Is this the Lee Kun I knew before?

699
00:46:37,833 --> 00:46:41,033
Before? Well.

700
00:46:41,033 --> 00:46:44,933
I'm just living for the moment today, like Won Bin.

701
00:46:44,933 --> 00:46:47,967
Let's go, little girl.

702
00:46:48,833 --> 00:46:50,167
Oh.

703
00:46:50,167 --> 00:46:53,500
Thank you for your meeting room.

704
00:46:55,933 --> 00:46:57,767
I'll inform all the journalists!

705
00:46:57,767 --> 00:46:58,833
Let's see who wins.

706
00:46:58,833 --> 00:47:00,933
I'll inform them Cha Si On is injured now.

707
00:47:00,933 --> 00:47:07,200
   

708
00:47:11,067 --> 00:47:12,233
Mister.

709
00:47:12,233 --> 00:47:15,433
Is it okay to spend money on rehab without any income?

710
00:47:15,433 --> 00:47:20,033
Do you know what to do if you fall while running?

711
00:47:20,033 --> 00:47:22,667
You need to adjust your shoelaces to fit your feet properly.

712
00:47:22,667 --> 00:47:25,867
Otherwise, you'll fall down again.

713
00:47:26,500 --> 00:47:27,600
So cool!

714
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:30,700
You just prepare to be a star of the universe.

715
00:47:30,700 --> 00:47:33,667
I've already started.

716
00:47:33,667 --> 00:47:35,600
Let's go.

717
00:47:36,867 --> 00:47:40,633
Professor Han, you've been working hard. Please help yourself.

718
00:47:40,633 --> 00:47:41,667
Yes, thank you.

719
00:47:41,667 --> 00:47:42,900
Is the research going well?

720
00:47:42,900 --> 00:47:45,333
Of course.

721
00:47:45,333 --> 00:47:50,700
Isn't this all thanks to Minister's enthusiastic support?

722
00:47:50,700 --> 00:47:53,833
I was about to talk about the budget approval.

723
00:47:53,833 --> 00:47:57,433
I heard the documentation hasn't been ready.

724
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,733
Documentation?

725
00:48:00,733 --> 00:48:05,800
The documentation that you received from the U.K.

726
00:48:09,433 --> 00:48:11,633
 I'm sorry. 

727
00:48:15,667 --> 00:48:18,133
Oh, sorry.

728
00:48:18,133 --> 00:48:21,633
Kyeong Ju Yeon, haven't you sent it yet?

729
00:48:24,367 --> 00:48:26,800
That is…

730
00:48:28,433 --> 00:48:31,167
It's my fault.

731
00:48:31,167 --> 00:48:33,333
Since the due date of the budget is today,

732
00:48:33,333 --> 00:48:36,767
we should organize it today to facilitate receiving next year's budget.

733
00:48:36,767 --> 00:48:41,000
Oh that's a problem.

734
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:44,100
I'll send it by fast delivery before the end of the day.

735
00:48:44,100 --> 00:48:46,767
Kyeong Ju Yeon, you got that?

736
00:48:46,767 --> 00:48:48,933
Today… by today?

737
00:48:48,933 --> 00:48:50,967
Yeah.

738
00:48:50,967 --> 00:48:53,867
I'll pour for you.

739
00:48:53,867 --> 00:48:58,533
No. I need a hard copy with an official seal on it, not an email.

740
00:48:58,533 --> 00:49:02,600
I need that as soon as possible. Can you send it by Air Flight today?

741
00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:06,600
What? It takes that long to reissue?

742
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:10,867
Can I speak to profess… professor's of the work?

743
00:49:10,867 --> 00:49:13,600
This is driving me crazy.

744
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:18,433
Please, is there any way to reissue it quickly?

745
00:49:18,433 --> 00:49:19,700
Call again tomorrow?

746
00:49:19,700 --> 00:49:21,767
Hello?

747
00:49:21,767 --> 00:49:24,167
Uh?

748
00:49:24,167 --> 00:49:25,533
This is driving me crazy.

749
00:49:25,533 --> 00:49:28,500
How could I have completely forgotten that?

750
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:31,433
I've been so out of it these past few days.

751
00:49:31,433 --> 00:49:34,467
He probably doesn't even remember it.

752
00:49:34,467 --> 00:49:35,900
Should I talk to his guardians?

753
00:49:35,900 --> 00:49:39,067
What to tell, then?

754
00:49:39,067 --> 00:49:40,733
Let's just die, Kyeong Ju Yeon.

755
00:49:40,733 --> 00:49:43,600
Die, die!

756
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:49,400
Dr. Kyeong.

757
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:51,800
I'm a little bit busy now.

758
00:50:01,233 --> 00:50:04,700
I can't ask him honestly, for real.

759
00:50:06,667 --> 00:50:08,700
Lee Shin.

760
00:50:09,533 --> 00:50:11,367
Nurse Song!

761
00:50:11,367 --> 00:50:12,900
- Yes. 
 - Do you have Lee Shin's phone number?

762
00:50:12,900 --> 00:50:15,300
Is Lee Shin's counseling today?

763
00:50:15,300 --> 00:50:17,633
The player Lee Shin?

764
00:50:17,633 --> 00:50:19,000
He's busy now.

765
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:22,567
We're cheering him as the final game is on.

766
00:50:22,567 --> 00:50:25,467
- Yes. 
 - Oh, right.

767
00:50:25,467 --> 00:50:26,600
Parents.

768
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:29,767
Is the guardian of Lee Kun in the hospital room?

769
00:50:31,633 --> 00:50:33,700
They are…

770
00:50:59,900 --> 00:51:02,400
 Hello? 

771
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:05,933
I'm Kyeong Ju Yeon, Lee Kun's psychiatrist.

772
00:51:05,933 --> 00:51:08,933
No, nothing particular.

773
00:51:08,933 --> 00:51:11,867
I need the patient's ID copy

774
00:51:11,867 --> 00:51:15,567
from the subject's experiment documentation.

775
00:51:15,567 --> 00:51:19,400
Kun's new ID is at home.

776
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:22,467
Nobody is at home because of the final game.

777
00:51:22,467 --> 00:51:25,400
I'll bring the ID in the evening after the competition.

778
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:28,633
I'm so sorry, but I really need it right now.

779
00:51:28,633 --> 00:51:30,200
If you don't mind,

780
00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:34,433
would it be okay for my staff to pick it up directly from your house?

781
00:51:34,433 --> 00:51:37,067
It is a really urgent case.

782
00:51:38,100 --> 00:51:40,433
We appreciate it, then.

783
00:51:40,433 --> 00:51:44,700
I'll text the front door password to you.

784
00:51:44,700 --> 00:51:49,500
Yes, thank you so much.

785
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:56,333
The doctor in charge is handling the paperwork as well.

786
00:52:03,100 --> 00:52:06,733
 Isn't it that you don't know how, not that you don't have time? 

787
00:52:06,733 --> 00:52:08,967
 It's either you don't examine what you want 

788
00:52:08,967 --> 00:52:12,700
 or you don't know how to. 

789
00:52:15,567 --> 00:52:17,433
 Then whose thoughts matter? 

790
00:52:17,433 --> 00:52:19,667
 It's your life. 

791
00:52:25,933 --> 00:52:29,200
 Why would you achieve my dream? 

792
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:31,633
 You should achieve your own dreams. 

793
00:52:44,533 --> 00:52:46,367
Eh…

794
00:52:47,133 --> 00:52:48,167
Shin.

795
00:52:48,167 --> 00:52:50,267
Well…

796
00:52:58,900 --> 00:53:01,500
Something that I want…

797
00:53:10,867 --> 00:53:14,300
Oh, it is urgent.

798
00:53:15,533 --> 00:53:17,033
What shall I do? What if I get caught?

799
00:53:17,033 --> 00:53:19,433
Arrested? Go to jail?

800
00:53:20,500 --> 00:53:22,900
Kyeong Ju Yeon, pull yourself together.

801
00:53:22,900 --> 00:53:26,967
This is all for the patients and for the future of brain science in Korea.

802
00:53:26,967 --> 00:53:29,400
Yes, I'm sorry about telling a lie,

803
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:31,067
but I'm just picking up my stuff. Right?

804
00:53:31,067 --> 00:53:32,933
Yes.

805
00:53:32,933 --> 00:53:34,800
Okay, okay.

806
00:54:21,567 --> 00:54:24,667
I'm so nervous, like I might die.

807
00:54:25,933 --> 00:54:28,467
You scared me!

808
00:54:28,467 --> 00:54:31,567
I didn't know about the dog.

809
00:54:34,967 --> 00:54:36,767
Hi,

810
00:54:36,767 --> 00:54:38,733
I'm not a thief.

811
00:54:38,733 --> 00:54:42,767
Do you possibly bite?

812
00:54:43,633 --> 00:54:47,167
Gosh, you startled me.

813
00:54:47,167 --> 00:54:50,167
You scared me.

814
00:54:51,233 --> 00:54:52,400
He's still sleeping?

815
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:54,133
Has Lee Kun not gone to rehab yet today?

816
00:54:54,133 --> 00:54:57,000
He was sleeping earlier. I'll wake him up now.

817
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,133
Okay.

818
00:54:59,133 --> 00:55:00,967
Oh my.

819
00:55:01,967 --> 00:55:03,967
Hey!

820
00:55:03,967 --> 00:55:06,167
Who are you?

821
00:55:06,167 --> 00:55:09,300
I'm awfully sorry.

822
00:55:09,300 --> 00:55:10,833
Lee Kun!

823
00:55:10,833 --> 00:55:13,067
    
 You'll be scolded if your master knows.

824
00:55:13,067 --> 00:55:16,633
What are you doing, greeting strangers like this?

825
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:46,933
It seems that this whole room is Lee Shin's.

826
00:55:48,433 --> 00:55:51,167
The luggage is…

827
00:56:01,433 --> 00:56:03,367
Welcome, how much do you want?

828
00:56:03,367 --> 00:56:05,100
Full with premium.

829
00:56:05,100 --> 00:56:07,133
It looks like a coupon?

830
00:56:10,867 --> 00:56:13,250
Oh, my mistake.

831
00:56:13,900 --> 00:56:15,100
I'll come back later.

832
00:56:15,100 --> 00:56:17,800
This is a gift for you.

833
00:56:24,267 --> 00:56:27,467
Mental coaching and personal stuff next week.

834
00:56:27,467 --> 00:56:29,333
Why did you stop serving?

835
00:56:29,333 --> 00:56:31,900
You only just managed to win.

836
00:56:35,300 --> 00:56:37,000
This won't work.

837
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:40,033
From today, let's immediately increase the time for serving lessons.

838
00:56:40,033 --> 00:56:42,433
I need to reschedule with the trainer.

839
00:56:42,433 --> 00:56:46,000
No, today we have a meeting with the ad agency.

840
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:47,067
Hey, Shin.

841
00:56:47,067 --> 00:56:49,000
What did you say?

842
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:53,467
I don't care about making money. I care about getting better.

843
00:56:53,467 --> 00:56:54,967
Hello?

844
00:56:54,967 --> 00:56:56,267
Yes, it's me.

845
00:56:56,267 --> 00:56:58,900
Did you see Shin's game today?

846
00:56:58,900 --> 00:57:00,000
I must leave.

847
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:01,133
Hey, but…

848
00:57:01,133 --> 00:57:03,933
What 'but'?

849
00:57:03,933 --> 00:57:06,233
You're leaving?

850
00:57:06,233 --> 00:57:09,333
Where are you going? You are supposed to meet the coach today.

851
00:57:09,333 --> 00:57:12,700
I feel like taking a shower and getting some sleep.

852
00:57:12,700 --> 00:57:14,420
By my own decision.

853
00:57:15,133 --> 00:57:16,633
Hey, Lee Shin!

854
00:57:16,633 --> 00:57:19,200
Can't you hear your mom? Lee Shin!

855
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:20,433
He needs a break, too.

856
00:57:20,433 --> 00:57:23,467
On my. You are spoiling him!

857
00:57:24,600 --> 00:57:27,367
Where is it? Why isn't it here?

858
00:57:27,367 --> 00:57:30,433
Strange, really, wait.

859
00:57:31,710 --> 00:57:33,430
Not there.

860
00:57:33,430 --> 00:57:35,300
That's the bathroom.

861
00:57:35,300 --> 00:57:38,000
Here is one more door.

862
00:57:41,033 --> 00:57:44,933
Excuse me.

863
00:57:50,167 --> 00:57:52,533
No, it isn't here either. This is driving me crazy.

864
00:57:52,533 --> 00:57:54,867
No, wait a second.

865
00:57:54,867 --> 00:57:55,933
How many doors are here?

866
00:57:55,933 --> 00:57:58,033
Where is it?

867
00:58:54,200 --> 00:58:57,000
Yes! It's mine.

868
00:58:57,767 --> 00:59:00,000
Thank you so much.

869
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,200
Let's go now.

870
00:59:03,433 --> 00:59:07,500
Thanks. Keep it a secret from your master.

871
00:59:19,660 --> 00:59:30,970


872
00:59:34,733 --> 00:59:39,300
♫  So high  ♫

873
00:59:39,300 --> 00:59:42,567
♫  Look at me, look at me, look at me  ♫

874
00:59:42,567 --> 00:59:47,133
♫  So high  ♫

875
00:59:47,133 --> 00:59:50,933
♫  Look at me, look at me, look at you  ♫

876
00:59:50,933 --> 00:59:58,267
♫  Only to me, can you please come  ♫

877
00:59:58,267 --> 01:00:02,800
♫  So high  ♫

878
01:00:02,800 --> 01:00:06,867
♫  Look at me, look at me, look at you  ♫

879
01:00:06,867 --> 01:00:14,633
♫  Like today, if I can walk a path along with you  ♫

880
01:00:14,633 --> 01:00:21,867
♫  Like every day, if I can see you always  ♫

881
01:00:21,867 --> 01:00:26,367
♫  So high  ♫

882
01:00:26,367 --> 01:00:30,633
♫  Look at me, look at me, look at me  ♫

883
01:00:31,733 --> 01:00:36,733
   

884
01:00:36,733 --> 01:00:38,833
 Did you come here to find your old memories by any chance? 

885
01:00:38,833 --> 01:00:39,833
 Are you curious about me? 

886
01:00:39,833 --> 01:00:41,667
 I'm more curious about you than me. 

887
01:00:41,667 --> 01:00:43,133
 You're not allowed to go out without a guardian. 

888
01:00:43,133 --> 01:00:44,800
 So, are you my guardian today? 

889
01:00:44,800 --> 01:00:46,000
 A medical guardian. 

890
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:47,967
 Don't ever touch my stuff again. 

891
01:00:47,967 --> 01:00:50,400
 Shouldn't the patient be told what the test is? 

892
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:51,500
 I'll take responsibility. 

893
01:00:51,500 --> 01:00:53,800
 Make sure nothing gets out of the operating room. 

894
01:00:53,800 --> 01:00:54,933
 Today's test is top secret. 

895
01:00:54,933 --> 01:00:56,333
 What have you done with the subject? 

896
01:00:56,333 --> 01:00:57,800
 Please stay out of my business. 

897
01:00:57,800 --> 01:00:59,867
 It doesn't matter since you have no emotional attachment to the patient. 

898
01:00:59,867 --> 01:01:01,567
 Dr. Kyeong, we're in trouble. 

899
01:01:01,567 --> 01:01:02,667
 The patient Lee Kun… 

900
01:01:02,667 --> 01:01:04,467
 I should have been on his side. 

901
01:01:04,467 --> 01:01:06,567
 I should have protected him. 

902
01:01:06,567 --> 01:01:09,820
 Let's stop here, both of us. 

903
01:01:09,820 --> 01:01:11,820
♫  When I fall in love  ♫
