00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:14,420
 ­

00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:18,110
   

4
00:00:21,290 --> 00:00:22,920
   

5
00:00:25,433 --> 00:00:33,400
   

6
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:39,367
   

7
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:45,700
It's really… What is this feeling? I feel proud.

8
00:00:50,067 --> 00:00:53,667
Wait! My phone!

9
00:00:53,667 --> 00:00:55,200
I think I left it behind. I'll bring it right away.

10
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:57,433
- Yes. 
 - Just a moment, one minute!

11
00:00:57,433 --> 00:00:59,333
One minute.

12
00:01:04,867 --> 00:01:07,267
Starting from now, one minute!

13
00:01:08,267 --> 00:01:12,300
 It can't possibly be. 

14
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:15,200
 It musn't be. 

15
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:19,433
 Because the me he sees isn't real. 

16
00:01:19,433 --> 00:01:23,433
Ju Yeon, I found it.

17
00:01:25,867 --> 00:01:27,933
 I should check. 

18
00:01:27,933 --> 00:01:31,833
 Let's find out my true feelings about him. 

19
00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:41,510


20
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:45,320
♫  This day ends  ♫

21
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:47,333
 My heart is beating 

22
00:01:47,333 --> 00:01:52,433
 faster than this person who ran at full speed. 

23
00:01:52,433 --> 00:01:55,850
 Do I really like this… 

24
00:01:55,850 --> 00:02:01,300
♫  Don't lose your light yet  ♫

25
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:03,400
♫  You are warmer than anyone else  ♫

26
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:06,600
 Do I really like… 

27
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,533
Are you okay?

28
00:02:10,633 --> 00:02:12,800
 It seems I like him. 

29
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:18,467
   

30
00:02:22,567 --> 00:02:24,400
Why did you suddenly run over here?

31
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,133
You're not fully recovered yet.

32
00:02:27,133 --> 00:02:32,133
I checked you for arrhythmia or something.

33
00:02:32,733 --> 00:02:36,400
So what is my condition?

34
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:40,633
You are normal.

35
00:02:40,633 --> 00:02:42,367
What about you?

36
00:02:42,367 --> 00:02:45,767
Then, what about you?

37
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:50,833
Perfectly, I'm normal.

38
00:02:52,167 --> 00:02:56,367
♫  Even in dreams  ♫

39
00:02:57,033 --> 00:03:03,033
♫  I will protect you  ♫

40
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:08,267
How often do you change the litter pad?

41
00:03:08,267 --> 00:03:09,200
From time to time.

42
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,767
Do you also care for their nutrition by using organic food?

43
00:03:11,767 --> 00:03:13,033
- Yes. 
 - Well.

44
00:03:13,033 --> 00:03:15,367
Will Cola come into contact with other dogs during walks?

45
00:03:15,367 --> 00:03:17,533
No, never mind.

46
00:03:17,533 --> 00:03:19,567
Please keep his cleanliness at the highest level

47
00:03:19,567 --> 00:03:21,800
to avoid transferring any harmful substances.

48
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:22,733
Please hand him over.

49
00:03:22,733 --> 00:03:26,700
It's very troublesome if he catches a disease.

50
00:03:28,233 --> 00:03:29,333
Please hand him over.

51
00:03:29,333 --> 00:03:31,767
This dog is very shy with strangers.

52
00:03:31,767 --> 00:03:33,667
Keep an appropriate distance from other dogs,

53
00:03:33,667 --> 00:03:36,967
but allow him to socialize with gentle dogs, so he doesn't get intimidated.

54
00:03:36,967 --> 00:03:38,533
Yes, please.

55
00:03:38,533 --> 00:03:41,133
Also, when he sleeps,

56
00:03:41,133 --> 00:03:43,900
he really likes sleeping in someone's arms.

57
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:46,100
Please hand him over.

58
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:49,267
You'll leave him in my care for two nights and three days, right?

59
00:03:49,267 --> 00:03:51,467
Please hand him over.

60
00:03:51,467 --> 00:03:52,633
Please hand him over.

61
00:03:52,633 --> 00:03:56,300
Ah, Cola looks handsome just like your dad.

62
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:58,633
- Dear, dear. 
 - Dad?

63
00:03:58,633 --> 00:04:01,367
Did I hear that wrong? Dad? Who? Me?

64
00:04:01,367 --> 00:04:04,867
Then, are you Cola's big brother?

65
00:04:04,867 --> 00:04:07,000
Big brother…

66
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:11,667
It's just a mere animal my brother is raising.

67
00:04:11,667 --> 00:04:14,367
- I will go. 
 - Yes.

68
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,867
- Take the best care of him. 
 - Yes.

69
00:04:51,967 --> 00:04:57,267
   

70
00:04:57,267 --> 00:05:01,033
It is an honor to be with the precious heroes of South Korea.

71
00:05:01,033 --> 00:05:05,300
It is an honor to be with the precious heroes of South Korea.

72
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:08,700
I heard once you get on the coach's bad side, it's over.

73
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:11,033
That's why you should be careful too.

74
00:05:11,033 --> 00:05:15,467
But I’m sure that together we will overcome any difficulty.

75
00:05:15,467 --> 00:05:19,067
Still, I feel healed thanks to our interpreter.

76
00:05:19,067 --> 00:05:22,333
The Athletes' Village training schedule will be tough, but let's overcome it together.

77
00:05:22,333 --> 00:05:24,567
Without you, I can surely overcome it.

78
00:05:24,567 --> 00:05:27,533
To do so, there are a few things we must adhere to.

79
00:05:27,533 --> 00:05:29,133
To do so, there are a few things we must adhere to.

80
00:05:29,133 --> 00:05:30,267
What? Did you two already know each other?

81
00:05:30,267 --> 00:05:32,767
- No, I don't know her. 
 - Oh, you startled me.

82
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,200
Hello.

83
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,933
I am Cha Si On, the youngest ever to be selected to the national team.

84
00:05:46,933 --> 00:05:50,000
Please take care of me.

85
00:05:55,433 --> 00:06:00,167
The atmosphere is too solemn.

86
00:06:00,933 --> 00:06:02,767
I think she just came here to have fun.

87
00:06:02,767 --> 00:06:06,033
Respecting commitments is a minimum requirement in any sport.

88
00:06:06,033 --> 00:06:10,663
Not only did you not show up for the pre-meeting, you were also late for orientation.

89
00:06:10,663 --> 00:06:14,800
Your behavior is unspeakable!

90
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,000
The basis of sports is a promise.

91
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,567
From not showing up for the pre-meeting to being late for orientation,

92
00:06:20,567 --> 00:06:22,767
it's all bad attitude.

93
00:06:22,767 --> 00:06:27,000
Show up at 5:00 p.m. sharp in the Athletes' Village today.

94
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,600
If you are even one minute late, you can give up playing for the national team.

95
00:06:32,267 --> 00:06:37,767
If you are even one minute late at 5:00 p.m. sharp in the Athletes' Village today,

96
00:06:37,767 --> 00:06:42,467
I'll take that to mean that you'll give up playing for the national team.

97
00:06:44,733 --> 00:06:48,000
It's the message from the coach.

98
00:07:13,733 --> 00:07:17,700
Please don't run into him. Please don't run into him.

99
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:21,567
Please don't run into him. Let's go further.

100
00:07:23,067 --> 00:07:24,767
   

101
00:07:44,033 --> 00:07:48,300
Oh my, Mr. Lee.

102
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:50,367
Yes, you are here.

103
00:07:50,367 --> 00:07:52,100
- Have you had a meal? 
 - Of course.

104
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:53,333
Have you eaten?

105
00:07:53,333 --> 00:07:54,933
I should treat you sometime.

106
00:07:54,933 --> 00:07:58,767
No, no. I will treat you.

107
00:08:02,467 --> 00:08:07,633
Why do you say that? You're the one who has been through much more.

108
00:08:07,633 --> 00:08:08,733
   

109
00:08:08,733 --> 00:08:12,800
Oh my. By the way, you look even more dashing today.

110
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,367
Oh, no. It's not.

111
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:25,900
Ju Yeon. I see.

112
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:30,633
You were troubled by too much work.

113
00:08:30,633 --> 00:08:34,500
You were lonely because you weren't dating.

114
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:37,833
Yes, our Ju Yeon. You were lonely.

115
00:08:37,833 --> 00:08:39,133
I see.

116
00:08:39,133 --> 00:08:43,500
Our Ju Yeon was lonely. I see.

117
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:48,300
I came because I heard there's a crazy woman in the changing room.

118
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:49,733
But it was you.

119
00:08:49,733 --> 00:08:53,833
Ah, let go. What are you doing?

120
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:59,433
I already knew it. You need a blind date.

121
00:08:59,433 --> 00:09:01,533
Ah, let go of me, please.

122
00:09:01,533 --> 00:09:03,367
Because I'm practicing mind control.

123
00:09:03,367 --> 00:09:07,267
It was like a mental victory. I see.

124
00:09:07,267 --> 00:09:09,833
By the way, who are you going to set her up on a blind date with? An athlete?

125
00:09:09,833 --> 00:09:14,533
It's a secret, but the players in the Athletes' Village are handsome.

126
00:09:14,533 --> 00:09:17,200
Stop! Stop!

127
00:09:18,167 --> 00:09:22,067
You dressed like this today? Are you going out?

128
00:09:24,867 --> 00:09:26,333
It's cool effortless look!

129
00:09:26,333 --> 00:09:30,333
Since I'm coming here, I dressed up naturally, as if I had not dressed up.

130
00:09:30,333 --> 00:09:33,233
It's obvious that you've put a lot of effort into dressing up.

131
00:09:33,233 --> 00:09:37,000
Player Si On, a player must distinguish between public and private affairs.

132
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,267
Stop nagging me!

133
00:09:39,267 --> 00:09:41,900
Just don't be late for the media day tomorrow.

134
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:46,067
I myself need a mental victory before the interview.

135
00:09:46,067 --> 00:09:48,067
Well, so speaking of which,

136
00:09:48,067 --> 00:09:51,167
I don't think I necessarily need to go.

137
00:09:51,167 --> 00:09:53,833
Or we can have a video call consultation before the interview.

138
00:09:53,833 --> 00:09:57,533
Well, I'll be on standby 24 hours a day, even in the middle of the night. How about that?

139
00:09:57,533 --> 00:10:00,167
Dr. Kyeong, why are you suddenly like this?

140
00:10:00,167 --> 00:10:03,400
You have to distinguish between work and private life.

141
00:10:05,567 --> 00:10:07,667
Player Si On.

142
00:10:07,667 --> 00:10:10,200
Player Si On.

143
00:10:11,833 --> 00:10:13,733
Then let's consult now. The interview is nothing.

144
00:10:13,733 --> 00:10:15,533
There's nothing to fear from the cameras and the reporters.

145
00:10:15,533 --> 00:10:19,633
Don't avoid it, stand up straight. And look right in the eyes! It's too easy. Right?

146
00:10:19,633 --> 00:10:21,733
Hey, little cutie.

147
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,967
Mister!

148
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:29,300
Right now, with Dr. Kyeong…

149
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:31,467
Where did she go?

150
00:10:31,467 --> 00:10:35,400
 Oh no, I can't look at his face. 

151
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:39,233
 Mind control… I'm not flustered at all. 

152
00:10:39,233 --> 00:10:41,267
 I'm not flustered at all. 

153
00:10:41,267 --> 00:10:42,700
 Not at all. 

154
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:47,233
It's okay, yeah. It's nothing.

155
00:10:47,233 --> 00:10:49,300
I'm fine.

156
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:51,267
I'm fine, yes.

157
00:10:51,267 --> 00:10:53,300
- What is fine? 
 - Oh, you startled me.

158
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:54,333
What's fine? What is it?

159
00:10:54,333 --> 00:10:56,733
Hello.

160
00:10:56,733 --> 00:10:57,867
- What? 
 - My mom.

161
00:10:57,867 --> 00:10:59,333
Oh my, awesome.

162
00:10:59,333 --> 00:11:02,433
Be quiet. No, no.

163
00:11:03,467 --> 00:11:05,800
What is it?

164
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:08,000
It's nothing.

165
00:11:12,633 --> 00:11:15,100
No. Oh my.

166
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:19,333
I sometimes hear that I resemble a celebrity.

167
00:11:19,333 --> 00:11:22,167
What will happen if those two people become so close

168
00:11:22,167 --> 00:11:25,133
and my brother's memories come back?

169
00:11:25,133 --> 00:11:28,033
Am I still a child? Why do I have to go with my mom?

170
00:11:28,033 --> 00:11:29,733
You are still a child.

171
00:11:29,733 --> 00:11:32,200
You have to get to the Athletes' Village by 5:00, right?

172
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:35,467
Let's meet at the entrance later, and don't cause any trouble.

173
00:11:35,467 --> 00:11:37,200
Oh, stop nagging me.

174
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,400
I want to go with you.

175
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,267
I don't want to go with my mom?

176
00:11:41,267 --> 00:11:45,367
Hey! You shouldn't say such mean things to your parents.

177
00:11:45,367 --> 00:11:47,733
If you act rudely to your mom, you'll be no good.

178
00:11:47,733 --> 00:11:50,333
She's going with you like this to support you.

179
00:11:50,333 --> 00:11:52,067
You will regret all your unfilial behavior later.

180
00:11:52,067 --> 00:11:53,567
Be good to your mom!

181
00:11:53,567 --> 00:11:55,467
Ah, why does she keep calling me?

182
00:11:55,467 --> 00:11:58,600
- Who is it? 
 - My mom.

183
00:12:01,267 --> 00:12:02,567
Well…

184
00:12:02,567 --> 00:12:07,900
Sometimes it might be better not to answer than to speak harshly.

185
00:12:12,167 --> 00:12:16,867
I've organized the expected media day questions and the answer guidelines on a USB.

186
00:12:18,733 --> 00:12:20,767
Ah, wait.

187
00:12:20,767 --> 00:12:22,867
Looks like I left it in the car. Wait a moment.

188
00:12:22,867 --> 00:12:26,033
Give it to me at the Athletes' Village later. Don't think of not coming.

189
00:12:26,033 --> 00:12:28,500
- Let's go. 
 - Okay.

190
00:12:30,533 --> 00:12:31,867
Really, sir?

191
00:12:31,867 --> 00:12:36,567
If it's the village youth association records, are all the residents who lived there recorded?

192
00:12:36,567 --> 00:12:38,733
That's great.

193
00:12:38,733 --> 00:12:41,133
   

194
00:12:41,133 --> 00:12:43,133
No, no.

195
00:12:43,133 --> 00:12:45,933
I can go there right away tomorrow.

196
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:52,800
 - The customer is currently on a call…  
 - Why isn't she answering the phone?

197
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,333
So… that…

198
00:12:55,333 --> 00:12:57,267
What should I suddenly say?

199
00:12:57,267 --> 00:13:02,167
You go to English kindergarten, tell him she's on the phone.

200
00:13:02,167 --> 00:13:05,067
She's busy.

201
00:13:05,067 --> 00:13:07,000
Where is she?

202
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Where? Do you mean where she is?

203
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,200
Well… The stadium?

204
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,833
The national tennis team players.

205
00:13:15,833 --> 00:13:18,467
Tell him she went to the orientation.

206
00:13:18,467 --> 00:13:21,967
Tennis orientation.

207
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:25,500
Really? Can I have the address?

208
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,600
Address! Address!

209
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:32,733
The address. She said it's on the back of the schedule.

210
00:13:32,733 --> 00:13:34,533
Here.

211
00:13:42,533 --> 00:13:45,600
All right. Okay, thanks.

212
00:13:50,367 --> 00:13:53,367
Goodbye, yes.

213
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,500
It seems Sae Yan's father sent him. Why doesn't she answer the phone?

214
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,433
Yes, then I'll see you tomorrow.

215
00:14:00,433 --> 00:14:03,900
Yes, thank you.

216
00:14:06,367 --> 00:14:08,467
What are you looking at?

217
00:14:08,467 --> 00:14:11,467
You're here as the coach's interpreter, not as the coach. You understand?

218
00:14:11,467 --> 00:14:13,567
Stop pretending to be a coach.

219
00:14:13,567 --> 00:14:17,467
You acted almost like an Oscar Best Actress winner.

220
00:14:17,467 --> 00:14:19,400
Me?

221
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,200
Do you know me?

222
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:25,933
Didn't we agree to pretend not to know each other?

223
00:14:25,933 --> 00:14:28,000
It's all for you.

224
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,933
You don't want to see my face either, do you?

225
00:14:30,933 --> 00:14:32,200
Of course.

226
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:36,167
Hey, you don't know anything. That Athletes' Village is like the military.

227
00:14:36,167 --> 00:14:38,233
You have to stick with me for 24 hours.

228
00:14:38,233 --> 00:14:41,933
Will you be able to have to eat, sleep,

229
00:14:41,933 --> 00:14:45,600
and live together with someone you don't like?

230
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:49,933
I mean, just seeing your face makes me want to hit you.

231
00:14:49,933 --> 00:14:53,300
The fact that I have to endure it is so annoying.

232
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:56,100
Just thinking about it is already dreadful.

233
00:14:56,700 --> 00:15:00,467
Right. If you get stressed, you'll get wrinkles here.

234
00:15:00,467 --> 00:15:02,600
Right?

235
00:15:07,933 --> 00:15:10,300
That's why I'm considering it.

236
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,700
What?

237
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:16,767
I'm already this annoyed, so I wonder how annoyed you must be?

238
00:15:16,767 --> 00:15:18,700
If you work out so hard that you're almost dying,

239
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:21,800
and your ex is always in front of you 24 hours a day,

240
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:25,267
not only will you get wrinkles, but you'll also cry.

241
00:15:25,267 --> 00:15:30,433
If I could only block your path, I would sacrifice myself.

242
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:33,800
Hey, you!

243
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:36,633
You better think carefully. Okay?

244
00:15:36,633 --> 00:15:38,033
Oh, my. She…

245
00:15:38,033 --> 00:15:40,000
Now, everyone this way.

246
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,933
Load all the big luggage into the luggage compartment.

247
00:15:41,933 --> 00:15:46,733
Now, hop on quickly to the fun Athletes' Village.

248
00:15:46,733 --> 00:15:49,833
- Who gave you permission? 
 - Oh my.

249
00:15:56,033 --> 00:15:57,033
Oh my.

250
00:15:57,033 --> 00:15:59,167
I'm fine. I'm fine.

251
00:15:59,167 --> 00:16:00,633
I'm not hurt. I'm fine.

252
00:16:00,633 --> 00:16:02,633
My car is over there, so let's go.

253
00:16:02,633 --> 00:16:05,267
Ju Yeon! Ju Yeon!

254
00:16:05,267 --> 00:16:07,267
Please take my car.

255
00:16:07,267 --> 00:16:09,533
- My car. 
 - No, there's no need for that.

256
00:16:09,533 --> 00:16:11,700
- Is that okay? 
 - Of course.

257
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:14,067
Sit next to me, put a tangerine in my mouth,

258
00:16:14,067 --> 00:16:16,600
and talk to me, so I don't fall asleep.

259
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:20,267
This is some kind of driving date.

260
00:16:20,267 --> 00:16:24,200
Since it's for work, please take my car.

261
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:26,100
Please take my car.

262
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:27,200
Please take my car.

263
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,733
Take my car.

264
00:16:28,733 --> 00:16:31,067
I'll just…

265
00:16:36,533 --> 00:16:39,533
I'll take the Player Lee Shin's car.

266
00:16:39,533 --> 00:16:42,833
No, that…

267
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,333
Are you all right?

268
00:16:46,333 --> 00:16:48,033
Let me see.

269
00:16:48,033 --> 00:16:50,033
You're fine. You're fine.

270
00:16:50,033 --> 00:16:52,267
See you later at the Athletes' Village.

271
00:16:52,267 --> 00:16:54,600
Oh, Sis. Sis!

272
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,800
Don't get in that car.

273
00:16:57,933 --> 00:17:01,033
Why are you interfering, Interpreter?

274
00:17:01,033 --> 00:17:03,367
She has to go with me.

275
00:17:03,367 --> 00:17:05,533
I don't want to ride in that car.

276
00:17:05,533 --> 00:17:09,933
If you don't want to take the car, ride the bus… Please.

277
00:17:09,933 --> 00:17:14,833
Or take the coach's car… Please!

278
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:18,200
We will be taking Mr. Lee's car.

279
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:20,233
That old car. Ah, sorry.

280
00:17:20,233 --> 00:17:22,367
Classic car!

281
00:17:22,367 --> 00:17:25,733
You sent me in a taxi that night, saying you had something to do.

282
00:17:25,733 --> 00:17:29,567
Yeah, a lot happened that night.

283
00:17:29,567 --> 00:17:33,300
Thanks to you, I slept fitfully at night.

284
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:37,633
Slept fitfully? Why?

285
00:17:37,633 --> 00:17:39,433
What happened?

286
00:17:39,433 --> 00:17:41,533
Come on, let's go together.

287
00:17:41,533 --> 00:17:43,330
No, wait a minute.

288
00:17:44,167 --> 00:17:45,267
Just the two of you?

289
00:17:45,267 --> 00:17:47,567
Ju Yeon has to come with us.

290
00:17:47,567 --> 00:17:48,700
All three of us should go.

291
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:51,967
Ah, no. No!

292
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:55,200
Then…

293
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,733
All three of you. Take my car, all of you.

294
00:17:57,733 --> 00:17:59,067
All together?

295
00:17:59,067 --> 00:18:01,267
You must stick close to me.

296
00:18:01,267 --> 00:18:02,833
Even when going to the bathroom. Okay?

297
00:18:02,833 --> 00:18:05,800
What's going on with Mr. Lee? Is there something with him?

298
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:07,567
There's nothing. That…

299
00:18:07,567 --> 00:18:10,167
You answer the phone. Mom has been looking for you for a while now.

300
00:18:10,167 --> 00:18:11,667
Right! I need to call your mom back.

301
00:18:11,667 --> 00:18:14,133
I'll make a call and go. Take this and go first.

302
00:18:14,133 --> 00:18:18,233
No, stay with me.

303
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:25,767
What happened?

304
00:18:25,767 --> 00:18:28,100
Why did you sleep fitfully?

305
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:30,200
You don't need to know.

306
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,067
Huh?

307
00:18:51,067 --> 00:18:53,867
Why did you sleep fitfully?

308
00:18:53,867 --> 00:18:57,167
Did something happen between you and Ju Yeon?

309
00:18:57,167 --> 00:18:59,167
It's because...

310
00:18:59,167 --> 00:19:03,567
your dog marks its territory just anywhere.

311
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:06,800
I thought it was something serious.

312
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,300
Did you leave Cola safely at the dog hotel?

313
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:11,067
I don't know. Just take care of your own dog.

314
00:19:11,067 --> 00:19:13,150
Don't bother me.

315
00:19:13,767 --> 00:19:16,767
But you like it, right?

316
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:24,867
I told you. We can just leave him at the pet hotel.

317
00:19:25,833 --> 00:19:30,567
Kun said he's postponing all his schedules and coming tomorrow night.

318
00:19:30,567 --> 00:19:33,600
Let's leave in two days, shall we?

319
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:38,633
But what did Kun do at the dog hotel that made them tell him not to come back?

320
00:19:38,633 --> 00:19:42,067
And every time Shin goes to the Athletes' Village,

321
00:19:42,067 --> 00:19:45,067
you don't have to follow him like this.

322
00:19:45,067 --> 00:19:49,933
You received Shin's diet plan, free-time, PT, and Pilates schedule. Right?

323
00:19:49,933 --> 00:19:54,933
Oh my! Shin is not that young. If he follows that schedule, his body will just…

324
00:19:54,933 --> 00:19:59,167
I've made sure to check with the team members that he started his weight control.

325
00:19:59,167 --> 00:20:02,700
And you rushed to renewhis contract with the agency

326
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:06,200
without even consulting me. Right?

327
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:08,467
I suppose it's better if I take care of the intense work. Right?

328
00:20:08,467 --> 00:20:11,433
Let me handle this… How can you keep digging up herbs like this every time?

329
00:20:11,433 --> 00:20:13,967
Do I just turn it like this?

330
00:20:20,267 --> 00:20:22,600
Oh, my gosh.

331
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:24,767
There's no strength in the sound.

332
00:20:24,767 --> 00:20:28,300
Here, take a bottle of this and drink it.

333
00:20:31,967 --> 00:20:35,133
Why aren't you answering the phone?

334
00:20:35,133 --> 00:20:40,600
Some foreigners that I guess your parents sent came looking for you.

335
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:42,367
So what did you say to them?

336
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:44,367
Please tell them I ran away or that I was missing.

337
00:20:44,367 --> 00:20:46,633
Just tell them I'm dead.

338
00:20:46,633 --> 00:20:49,300
If I get caught, I can't come back to Korea again.

339
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:53,900
What? I told them you went to orientation.

340
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:58,933
I gave them the official document from the association.

341
00:20:58,933 --> 00:21:02,133
Oh, my gosh. When?

342
00:21:07,367 --> 00:21:10,133
Ju Yeon, please get in.

343
00:21:10,133 --> 00:21:13,980
Ju Yeon, please get in.

344
00:21:14,533 --> 00:21:16,520
Ju Yeon.

345
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:25,100
Sae Yan, let's go!

346
00:21:28,267 --> 00:21:33,200
Get in. Hurry up and get in.

347
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,567
Then, I'll take the front seat.

348
00:21:35,567 --> 00:21:36,600
- Get in now. 
 - You drive…

349
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,133
Get in!

350
00:21:38,133 --> 00:21:39,800
Hey!

351
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,400
Hey!

352
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,833
Hey, this is a new car.

353
00:21:42,833 --> 00:21:44,533
You need to drive well.

354
00:21:44,533 --> 00:21:46,533
Sae Yan, what's going on?

355
00:21:46,533 --> 00:21:48,167
Ju Yeon, please fasten your seatbelt.

356
00:21:48,167 --> 00:21:50,200
Oh, I'll take care of mine.

357
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,333
You don't need to do this for me.

358
00:21:51,333 --> 00:21:53,367
That's my seatbelt.

359
00:21:53,367 --> 00:21:55,633
Oh no! What should we do?

360
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:57,967
Skinship!

361
00:21:57,967 --> 00:22:00,200
 No, no. Skinship is not allowed! 

362
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:03,167
What? Who are those people?

363
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:08,167
Wait, Sae Yan. Drive slowly!

364
00:22:08,167 --> 00:22:10,700
Sae Yan! Sae Yan!

365
00:22:17,967 --> 00:22:20,000
Someone in front!

366
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:26,233
This is driving me crazy.

367
00:22:29,467 --> 00:22:34,267
 It seems I've probably missed the golden time. 

368
00:22:34,267 --> 00:22:36,933
Is everyone okay?

369
00:22:36,933 --> 00:22:40,300
Shall we get going then?

370
00:22:41,233 --> 00:22:45,267
Slowly, safe driving! Slowly.

371
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:52,833
You got startled, huh?

372
00:22:52,833 --> 00:22:55,533
If we're late, I'll get fired.

373
00:22:55,533 --> 00:22:58,100
You have to be alive to get fired.

374
00:22:59,467 --> 00:23:01,133
I'm alive, right?

375
00:23:01,133 --> 00:23:03,433
We almost got hurt.

376
00:23:03,433 --> 00:23:06,633
Besides, do you know how dangerous it is to sit in the middle?

377
00:23:06,633 --> 00:23:07,767
Sis, are you hurt?

378
00:23:07,767 --> 00:23:10,200
Look in front!

379
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:14,433
I have a bit of a headache.

380
00:23:14,433 --> 00:23:16,767
You got startled.

381
00:23:16,767 --> 00:23:19,167
What driving license did you get, bumper cars?

382
00:23:19,167 --> 00:23:22,100
You did that on purpose to finish me off, right?

383
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:25,772
No. If I wanted to finish you off, I would have done it when I was alone with you.

384
00:23:25,772 --> 00:23:26,500
Do you two know each other?

385
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:28,533
- No! 
 - No!

386
00:23:29,633 --> 00:23:33,300
Sorry, sorry. From now on, I'll drive safely.

387
00:23:34,033 --> 00:23:37,200
 The more I struggle to get out, the more I feel like I'm sinking in. 

388
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:40,067
 All my attention is focused on this person. 

389
00:23:40,067 --> 00:23:43,333
 No more, romance is not allowed. 

390
00:23:45,267 --> 00:23:47,033
Ju Yeon, you don't look well?

391
00:23:47,033 --> 00:23:48,833
Hold on.

392
00:23:50,033 --> 00:23:51,400
- Are you okay? 
- Yes.

393
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:55,333
I have a headache and feel a bit nauseous. Maybe it's motion sickness.

394
00:23:55,333 --> 00:23:59,000
I think I'll feel better after some sleep.

395
00:24:02,433 --> 00:24:03,733
- Ju Yeon. 
 - Ju Yeon.

396
00:24:03,733 --> 00:24:07,567
- Here. 
 - Ah, thank you.

397
00:24:08,667 --> 00:24:10,300
 Let's avoid meeting as much as possible. 

398
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:12,533
 Don't look, and don't listen. 

399
00:24:12,533 --> 00:24:14,233
 I'd rather sleep. 

400
00:24:14,233 --> 00:24:17,067
Who were those people chasing us earlier?

401
00:24:17,067 --> 00:24:20,000
They were people sent by my father.

402
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
My family is a bit strict.

403
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,733
If I get caught, I won't be able to return to Korea again.

404
00:24:24,733 --> 00:24:28,733
Why did you decide to run away from home and stay in Korea?

405
00:24:28,733 --> 00:24:31,800
I'm trying to find someone I desperately miss.

406
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:35,033
- Someone you desperately miss? 
 - Ah, I'm hungry!

407
00:24:35,033 --> 00:24:38,467
I guess my blood sugar dropped because I was startled earlier.

408
00:24:39,667 --> 00:24:44,800
The next rest area sells amazing sausage and rice cake skewers.

409
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:47,233
Rice cake skewer?

410
00:24:47,233 --> 00:24:49,900
I heard Ju Yeon, whom our interpreter dotes on,

411
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:52,267
say her favorite snack is sausage and rice cake skewers.

412
00:24:52,267 --> 00:24:53,567
Oh my. She's not even a child.

413
00:24:53,567 --> 00:24:56,700
Really? Then we should go if it's her favorite snack.

414
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:58,133
Right?

415
00:24:58,133 --> 00:25:01,433
And actually, the fuel light has been on for a while too.

416
00:25:01,433 --> 00:25:04,000
- Huh? 
 - Yes.

417
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,733
   

418
00:25:12,733 --> 00:25:16,267
 Even plants propagate. 

419
00:25:16,267 --> 00:25:19,433
 It seems like Nurse Song might like me, 

420
00:25:19,433 --> 00:25:22,067
 or maybe she doesn't. 

421
00:25:22,067 --> 00:25:25,033
 It would be nice if I could get a hint. 

422
00:25:25,033 --> 00:25:30,800
 Nurse Song, please send me a signal. 

423
00:25:38,770 --> 00:25:42,330
 ­  

424
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:49,233
 I love you not because I love you, 

425
00:25:49,233 --> 00:25:54,133
 but because I cannot help it. 

426
00:25:54,133 --> 00:25:58,300
 Oh my! Why did he leave quotes in the group chat? 

427
00:25:58,300 --> 00:26:01,167
 Professor Han is indeed an old man. 

428
00:26:02,233 --> 00:26:06,167
 It's such a poetic and heart-fluttering phrase. 

429
00:26:06,167 --> 00:26:10,700
 Her sensibilities match mine so well. 

430
00:26:13,467 --> 00:26:14,767
Now.

431
00:26:14,767 --> 00:26:18,300
Let's go have lunch at a place with a nice atmosphere today.

432
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:19,700
Really?

433
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:21,033
Pasta?

434
00:26:21,033 --> 00:26:22,067
Lobster?

435
00:26:22,067 --> 00:26:23,767
No, no.

436
00:26:23,767 --> 00:26:28,533
A herbal whole duck soup restaurant with a yard!

437
00:26:28,533 --> 00:26:29,833
Oh my!

438
00:26:29,833 --> 00:26:32,067
Lately, my body has felt quite weak.

439
00:26:32,067 --> 00:26:35,267
I'll really nourish my body well today.

440
00:26:35,267 --> 00:26:37,567
 She has good tastes that match mine. 

441
00:26:37,567 --> 00:26:40,933
I really like houses with such yards.

442
00:26:40,933 --> 00:26:43,000
I want to live in such a place.

443
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,567
Don't you think so, Professor Han?

444
00:26:44,567 --> 00:26:47,567
 Does she mean she wants to live in such a place with me? 

445
00:26:47,567 --> 00:26:49,567
 Is this a signal? 

446
00:26:49,567 --> 00:26:52,367
 Does she like me? 

447
00:26:52,933 --> 00:26:56,900
 Will I finally be able to propagate? 

448
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:59,667
Well, let's go eat.

449
00:26:59,667 --> 00:27:02,467
Call Te Oh, too.

450
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:09,600
- I have eaten well. 
 - I have eaten well.

451
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:12,467
I can afford this much.

452
00:27:12,467 --> 00:27:15,467
Professor, it was truly delicious.

453
00:27:16,133 --> 00:27:19,100
- I have eaten well, Professor. 
 - No, no.

454
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:21,900
Everyone, go out and get some fresh air.

455
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:23,633
We'll go out first.

456
00:27:23,633 --> 00:27:25,833
- I have eaten well. 
 - The check, please.

457
00:27:25,833 --> 00:27:27,933
Thank you.

458
00:27:35,033 --> 00:27:38,033
By any chance, are there coffee candies?

459
00:27:38,033 --> 00:27:39,500
No, my woman…

460
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:43,233
No, my crush really likes them.

461
00:27:43,233 --> 00:27:44,700
Please try looking there.

462
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:48,300
Ah, it's not here.

463
00:27:54,367 --> 00:27:56,233
Coffee flavor!

464
00:27:56,233 --> 00:27:59,033
- Thank you. 
 - Yes, thank you.

465
00:28:01,533 --> 00:28:05,567
Come to think of it, you and Professor Han are wearing couple outfits.

466
00:28:05,567 --> 00:28:06,667
Couple outfits?

467
00:28:06,667 --> 00:28:10,200
For some reason, you and Professor Han seemed

468
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:12,633
like a loving married couple.

469
00:28:14,567 --> 00:28:16,300
With the elderly?

470
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:18,567
 Elderly? 

471
00:28:18,567 --> 00:28:21,700
You're wearing similar colors.

472
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:26,433
I think I should just throw this outfit away.

473
00:28:26,433 --> 00:28:29,300
I was kind to him because he reminds me of my late father.

474
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:31,667
 Huh? Your father? 

475
00:28:31,667 --> 00:28:35,900
Ah, a married couple? That really upsets me.

476
00:28:39,433 --> 00:28:41,233
It's my first time seeing Nurse Song angry.

477
00:28:41,233 --> 00:28:44,667
It's understandable to be angry. Aren't they a generation apart?

478
00:28:44,667 --> 00:28:46,433
You went too far.

479
00:28:46,433 --> 00:28:48,367
No, that's not it.

480
00:28:48,367 --> 00:28:50,300
Nurse Song.

481
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:52,333
Let's go.

482
00:28:57,233 --> 00:29:01,767
 She thought of me like a father, not like a romantic relationship… 

483
00:29:15,767 --> 00:29:18,433
Driving in Korea made me tense, and now I'm tired.

484
00:29:18,433 --> 00:29:21,767
I'll take over the driving from now on, Interpreter.

485
00:29:21,767 --> 00:29:23,967
Everyone, go to the restroom and come back.

486
00:29:23,967 --> 00:29:27,833
You too, our hardworking interpreter, go and come back from the restroom.

487
00:29:27,833 --> 00:29:30,133
I'm fine. I have a big bladder.

488
00:29:30,133 --> 00:29:31,233
Everyone, don't be late.

489
00:29:31,233 --> 00:29:33,533
If you guys are late, everyone from athletes to staff will be fired.

490
00:29:33,533 --> 00:29:35,567
Then, I'll go buy some snacks.

491
00:29:35,567 --> 00:29:36,833
Oh, wait a minute. Just a minute.

492
00:29:36,833 --> 00:29:39,867
Let's each buy something delicious.

493
00:29:39,867 --> 00:29:41,633
All right.

494
00:29:41,633 --> 00:29:44,400
All right, here.

495
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:46,700
Everyone takes ten thousand won.

496
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:51,400
All right, get off. Let's go! To buy something delicious to eat.

497
00:29:52,733 --> 00:29:55,067
Please go buy some snacks.

498
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,367
- Hey. 
 - Why?

499
00:30:03,367 --> 00:30:05,167
Watch your mouth.

500
00:30:05,167 --> 00:30:07,867
If you do that, it'll be obvious that we dated for a little while.

501
00:30:07,867 --> 00:30:09,700
It's not obvious that we dated briefly,

502
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:11,533
but I can't hide that I hate you.

503
00:30:11,533 --> 00:30:14,333
Sorry.

504
00:30:14,333 --> 00:30:16,667
So you're not going to the rest stop, right?

505
00:30:16,667 --> 00:30:20,767
Ah, that's great. I saved my money then.

506
00:30:20,767 --> 00:30:22,700
For whose benefit?

507
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:24,733
Move aside.

508
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:28,133
Oh, it's cold.

509
00:30:29,033 --> 00:30:32,367
You! Oh, it's cold.

510
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:38,467
Since I just made ten thousand won, should I go and rest in the car?

511
00:30:43,167 --> 00:30:44,200
Hello.

512
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:46,767
Please give me four iced Americanos.

513
00:30:46,767 --> 00:30:49,100
No, please give me three.

514
00:30:52,933 --> 00:30:55,133
Here is the receipt.

515
00:30:59,667 --> 00:31:01,300
Hello?

516
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:03,733
Yes, Sae Yan's father.

517
00:31:03,733 --> 00:31:06,233
Your daughter is with me.

518
00:31:06,233 --> 00:31:08,333
Yes.

519
00:31:08,333 --> 00:31:09,833
No, no, no!

520
00:31:09,833 --> 00:31:12,900
I'm not dating her again. Please just take her home.

521
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:14,600
Yes.

522
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:18,133
We are at…

523
00:31:18,133 --> 00:31:20,400
Come to your senses, Kyeong Ju Yeon.

524
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:23,380
Why on earth are you doing this, huh?

525
00:31:24,067 --> 00:31:26,967
Why did you buy this jelly?

526
00:31:29,267 --> 00:31:31,533
No, I bought it because I wanted to eat it.

527
00:31:31,533 --> 00:31:34,233
I really like jelly.

528
00:31:34,233 --> 00:31:35,233
I love it.

529
00:31:35,233 --> 00:31:37,967
I like jelly the best in the world.

530
00:31:44,933 --> 00:31:45,933
How much is it?

531
00:31:45,933 --> 00:31:47,700
It's 2,000 won.

532
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:53,933
She's feeling nauseous, and she has a stomachache.

533
00:31:53,933 --> 00:31:57,567
- Motion sickness? 
 - Yes. She also has a bit of a headache.

534
00:31:57,567 --> 00:31:59,767
She slept with the clothes over her head.

535
00:31:59,767 --> 00:32:01,967
Oh, a cold?

536
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:06,433
She's been a bit sensitive with me all day long.

537
00:32:06,433 --> 00:32:09,000
And she got a bit irritated with me.

538
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,500
Oh, I guess it's not you, but your girlfriend?

539
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:15,033
A girlfriend?

540
00:32:15,033 --> 00:32:17,867
Well, we're not an official couple yet.

541
00:32:17,867 --> 00:32:19,800
But we're in a similar kind of relationship.

542
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:21,300
Did she have a fever?

543
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:23,800
Is there any possibility of pregnancy?

544
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:26,367
Pregnancy?

545
00:32:26,367 --> 00:32:29,633
No, I mean, if she gets pregnant just because I hugged her once,

546
00:32:29,633 --> 00:32:32,733
then all the people in the world…

547
00:32:36,167 --> 00:32:39,400
Please give me motion sickness pills, cold medicine, and painkillers.

548
00:32:43,067 --> 00:32:45,433
- It's 10,000 won. 
 - Okay.

549
00:32:47,767 --> 00:32:51,233
- If I exclude this, it's 8,000 won. Right? 
 - Yes.

550
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:54,833
Here it is.

551
00:32:58,556 --> 00:33:00,831
   

552
00:33:03,567 --> 00:33:05,300
Yes, thank you.

553
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:07,633
- Thank you. 
 - Take care.

554
00:33:11,967 --> 00:33:15,600
Is it a delicious restaurant? I happen to have 2,000 won left.

555
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:18,233
Let's just go. We need to hurry now.

556
00:33:18,233 --> 00:33:22,333
No, it will be quick. There's only one person in front of me.

557
00:33:22,333 --> 00:33:23,700
All right then, you have to come back quickly.

558
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:26,433
Yes, I'll be there soon.

559
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:31,033
Oh no, I'm going to miss the bus at this rate.

560
00:33:33,167 --> 00:33:35,767
Then go ahead and order first.

561
00:33:35,767 --> 00:33:39,133
Oh my. Thank you, young man.

562
00:33:39,767 --> 00:33:43,267
Please give me 50 of these.

563
00:33:43,267 --> 00:33:45,200
50?

564
00:33:50,567 --> 00:33:54,233
Jeon Sae Yan, you're no longer in my life now.

565
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:59,133
Ju Yeon? Ah, I need to be quiet.

566
00:33:59,133 --> 00:34:03,600
Right, everything will be perfect once my brother arrives.

567
00:34:04,367 --> 00:34:06,133
Okay.

568
00:34:06,133 --> 00:34:08,300
Good, good.

569
00:34:11,233 --> 00:34:16,400
What? Why did he come with Jeon Sae Yan?

570
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:18,733
Ah, right, whatever.

571
00:34:18,733 --> 00:34:22,533
He's not staff, so he'll manage to come on his own.

572
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:26,633
Oh my, oh my, excuse me! I'm over here!

573
00:34:26,633 --> 00:34:29,200
Yes, goodbye.

574
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:31,033
Ju Yeon!

575
00:34:31,033 --> 00:34:32,733
- What's going on? 
 - You also didn't get in the car?

576
00:34:32,733 --> 00:34:34,933
Why did they leave us out and depart?

577
00:34:34,933 --> 00:34:36,833
Wait! Let me make a call.

578
00:34:36,833 --> 00:34:37,833
Oh, right.

579
00:34:37,833 --> 00:34:39,200
Ah, my phone is in that car. You try calling.

580
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:42,000
Hold on. Just a moment.

581
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
Don't have it?

582
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,400
Seriously, just stay still.

583
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:47,300
Public phone booth…

584
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:50,367
Do you happen to have your wallet?

585
00:34:51,967 --> 00:34:53,967
I don't.

586
00:35:04,433 --> 00:35:08,767
Sorry, this is all for you.

587
00:35:12,767 --> 00:35:13,900
Hello.

588
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:16,967
 This is Kyeong Ju Yeon. Did you leave us behind? 

589
00:35:16,967 --> 00:35:20,567
Oh dear, I'm sorry. We were in a hurry so I went ahead with Ju Yeon…

590
00:35:21,933 --> 00:35:23,800
Ju Yeon?

591
00:35:27,333 --> 00:35:31,267
What? Have we already arrived?

592
00:35:31,267 --> 00:35:33,567
Hey, why are you here!

593
00:35:33,567 --> 00:35:36,000
What did he say? Give it to me.

594
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,933
 Hey, Lee Shin. You come back right now. 

595
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:44,167
What? Where is everyone?

596
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,800
What did you say?

597
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:49,100
What? Where?

598
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:50,300
A resort…

599
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:52,067
A resort?

600
00:35:52,067 --> 00:35:55,400
Okay, just wait there for now.

601
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:57,467
Yes.

602
00:35:57,467 --> 00:35:59,367
- The resort, here? 
 - Yes.

603
00:35:59,367 --> 00:36:02,300
   

604
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:04,833
Yeah, the truth is I was going to leave without you!

605
00:36:04,833 --> 00:36:07,333
- So what are you going to do? 
 - Are you trying to get me fired?

606
00:36:07,333 --> 00:36:09,767
Lee Shin!

607
00:36:10,633 --> 00:36:12,533
I'm a national representative.

608
00:36:12,533 --> 00:36:13,967
Do you know how much I'm worth?

609
00:36:13,967 --> 00:36:17,033
I work for the country, you know?

610
00:36:17,033 --> 00:36:20,700
Why do you keep interfering in my life?

611
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:23,033
If you keep doing this, I won't stay still.

612
00:36:23,033 --> 00:36:27,867
Why do you keep appearing and interfering in my life?

613
00:36:27,867 --> 00:36:31,400
You're the one who suddenly barged into my life and caused a mess!

614
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:35,867
This bracelet, I'm going to cut off the bracelet.

615
00:36:35,867 --> 00:36:38,267
Let that go.

616
00:36:38,267 --> 00:36:39,267
Why don't you let go first?

617
00:36:39,267 --> 00:36:42,167
How can I trust you? You let go first.

618
00:36:42,167 --> 00:36:45,967
Then let's let go on the count of three.

619
00:36:45,967 --> 00:36:47,333
One.

620
00:36:47,333 --> 00:36:49,233
Two.

621
00:36:49,233 --> 00:36:50,933
Three!

622
00:37:07,467 --> 00:37:09,100
Are you doing well there?

623
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:10,867
Yes.

624
00:37:10,867 --> 00:37:13,767
Don't worry. I won't lose you.

625
00:37:13,767 --> 00:37:16,700
You said it would be faster if we take the shortcut.

626
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:20,533
You said it would take 30 minutes, but it's already…

627
00:37:20,533 --> 00:37:23,467
What's wrong? Are you in pain again?

628
00:37:23,467 --> 00:37:24,500
I have some over-the-counter medicine.

629
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:28,000
Really? That's a relief. I was in so much pain, so I almost cried.

630
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,800
Knowing you might be in pain, I went to the pharmacy earlier.

631
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:31,667
You have a band-aid, right?

632
00:37:31,667 --> 00:37:35,533
My heels have been peeling and bleeding since a while ago.

633
00:37:35,533 --> 00:37:37,467
Band-aid…

634
00:37:39,033 --> 00:37:42,567
What I have with me now is just… cold medicine and…

635
00:37:42,567 --> 00:37:47,300
Just cold medicine and motion-sickness pills.

636
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:48,833
Medicine for menstrual cramp…

637
00:37:48,833 --> 00:37:54,200
There is no band-aid. You didn't buy the most common thing.

638
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:57,000
Let's just go.

639
00:37:58,833 --> 00:38:00,600
- Well… 
 - I'm fine.

640
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:03,700
Take a rest before we go.

641
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:07,633
Player Lee Shin must be waiting, so we should hurry.

642
00:38:07,633 --> 00:38:08,767
Are you…

643
00:38:08,767 --> 00:38:10,567
Are you that worried about Shin?

644
00:38:10,567 --> 00:38:12,967
Yes, I'm worried about him.

645
00:38:12,967 --> 00:38:15,033
If Player Lee Shin is late, Sae Yan will be late too.

646
00:38:15,033 --> 00:38:17,433
If Player Lee Shin doesn't join the team, Si On won't be able to join, either.

647
00:38:17,433 --> 00:38:19,767
If that happens…

648
00:38:22,233 --> 00:38:24,533
Don't make me talk.

649
00:38:24,533 --> 00:38:26,100
Why…

650
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:28,400
Why have you been like this all day?

651
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:30,933
You are sensitive and avoid me, and don't even make eye contact…

652
00:38:30,933 --> 00:38:33,967
You don't even look at my eyes. Are you angry with me?

653
00:38:33,967 --> 00:38:35,067
No.

654
00:38:35,067 --> 00:38:36,800
Is there something I did wrong?

655
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:39,767
- No… 
 - Well, then.

656
00:38:39,767 --> 00:38:44,500
Is it because of what happened that night?

657
00:38:45,667 --> 00:38:51,133
As a doctor, I examined you because I was worried. What's wrong with that?

658
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:59,600
It's been too hard, so I've become a bit sensitive.

659
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:02,567
Let's take a rest a bit before we go.

660
00:39:02,567 --> 00:39:04,500
Let's do that.

661
00:39:19,933 --> 00:39:21,733
Aren't you tired?

662
00:39:21,733 --> 00:39:24,000
I'm tired.

663
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:28,400
Let's take a rest here for a bit before we go.

664
00:39:52,733 --> 00:39:54,567
Now.

665
00:40:05,733 --> 00:40:08,400
It's not a ring.

666
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:14,167
What are you talking about? I thought you were going to kneel and apologize.

667
00:40:14,167 --> 00:40:16,567
Even if there is no band, let's disinfect it.

668
00:40:16,567 --> 00:40:18,667
I won't do it now. I'll do it later.

669
00:40:18,667 --> 00:40:21,000
Let me see.

670
00:40:22,433 --> 00:40:25,100
You're pretty hurt.

671
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:27,267
It makes me sad.

672
00:40:30,633 --> 00:40:31,800
I'm okay.

673
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:34,567
I'm not okay.

674
00:40:36,533 --> 00:40:41,333
If you disinfect, I'll give you a gift.

675
00:40:41,333 --> 00:40:43,967
What gift…

676
00:40:45,133 --> 00:40:46,800
Ta-da!

677
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:48,333
Even with this?

678
00:40:48,333 --> 00:40:51,467
Sausage and rice cake skewer.

679
00:40:52,733 --> 00:40:54,633
Oh my!

680
00:40:55,533 --> 00:40:56,600
If you don't like it, then never mind.

681
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:59,433
Just a moment.

682
00:41:07,067 --> 00:41:12,733
Okay, then let's start the disinfection!

683
00:41:12,733 --> 00:41:15,233
Oh, no. It must hurt.

684
00:41:16,333 --> 00:41:18,833
You're bearing it well.

685
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:21,600
Ah, you're bearing it well.

686
00:41:22,633 --> 00:41:24,500
Please.

687
00:41:26,767 --> 00:41:29,500
You're acting like a crybaby.

688
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:32,100
This isn't that painful.

689
00:41:32,100 --> 00:41:35,700
Huh, what? Are you crying now?

690
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:38,033
I'm not crying.

691
00:41:38,033 --> 00:41:39,300
You're crying.

692
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:41,333
There are tears in your eyes.

693
00:41:41,333 --> 00:41:43,467
I'm not crying.

694
00:41:43,467 --> 00:41:46,700
You said you've never cried in your life, but you're quite the crybaby.

695
00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:48,933
If that's not tears, then what is it?

696
00:41:48,933 --> 00:41:52,200
Look, look! I didn't cry.

697
00:41:57,867 --> 00:42:00,300
Now I can finally see you properly.

698
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:02,067
Your eyes.

699
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:08,833
Okay, the disinfection is done.

700
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:11,133
Eat.

701
00:42:11,133 --> 00:42:12,800
Yes.

702
00:42:17,633 --> 00:42:21,633
I had no intention of cutting it, but what's so great about this bracelet?

703
00:42:21,633 --> 00:42:25,367
Life in the Athletes' Village seems like it'll be bleak from now on.

704
00:42:29,533 --> 00:42:32,000
Okay, okay.

705
00:42:33,967 --> 00:42:35,800
It's done. It's done.

706
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:38,867
It's a little short, but it's okay.

707
00:42:39,633 --> 00:42:43,300
By the way, where is she? Why isn't she coming back?

708
00:42:43,300 --> 00:42:45,333
Is she very angry?

709
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:49,400
Yeah, but it's okay because I made this.

710
00:42:50,133 --> 00:42:52,000
Lee Shin, you deceitful jerk.

711
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,433
Go to hell.

712
00:42:56,233 --> 00:42:59,367
But I came up here in a fit of anger,

713
00:42:59,367 --> 00:43:02,600
but where on earth am I now?

714
00:43:03,533 --> 00:43:05,133
    
 What is this?

715
00:43:05,133 --> 00:43:08,067
Are there snakes here?

716
00:43:11,733 --> 00:43:13,800
Oh, that startled me.

717
00:43:31,433 --> 00:43:33,300
She left her cellphone behind.

718
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:36,667
She is so bad with directions.

719
00:43:36,667 --> 00:43:39,300
Why can't you do something right?

720
00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:43,000
Jeon Sae Yan! Jeon Sae Yan from Napoli!

721
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:46,567
If I find you, I won't stay still.

722
00:43:46,567 --> 00:43:48,933
I don't even have a cellphone.

723
00:43:48,933 --> 00:43:53,067
What? Isn't this the place I came earlier?

724
00:43:53,067 --> 00:43:56,600
Ju Yeon.

725
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:59,100
Hey!

726
00:43:59,100 --> 00:44:02,233
You have to find me. Why are you looking for Ju Yeon?

727
00:44:02,233 --> 00:44:06,700
Why are you only coming now! I almost got bitten by an anaconda!

728
00:44:06,700 --> 00:44:09,700
If you're glad to see me again, just say it's nice to see me.

729
00:44:09,700 --> 00:44:13,100
And are we in the "Amazon"? Why would there be an anaconda?

730
00:44:13,100 --> 00:44:15,167
You look like the kind of person who would soak an anaconda alive in alcohol and drink it.

731
00:44:15,167 --> 00:44:17,367
If you had come any later, I'd have buried you alive here.

732
00:44:17,367 --> 00:44:20,600
Now you're finally showing your true colors.

733
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:22,700
If you keep doing that, you climb down alone.

734
00:44:22,700 --> 00:44:24,833
To make the snakes come out, I guess I should call them.

735
00:44:24,833 --> 00:44:27,967
Hey, shut up! Shut up!

736
00:44:27,967 --> 00:44:29,700
You are as cunning as a fox.

737
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:32,367
Then, why are you trying to work where I am?

738
00:44:32,367 --> 00:44:34,533
What's the reason you insist on working?

739
00:44:34,533 --> 00:44:38,100
If you stick with me, we'll just fight.

740
00:44:38,100 --> 00:44:41,733
If I stay there, it'll be easier to ask around, and I'll have a reason to stay in Korea.

741
00:44:41,733 --> 00:44:43,867
Right, did you find that out?

742
00:44:43,867 --> 00:44:46,833
You said there might be someone you know in the countryside.

743
00:44:49,300 --> 00:44:51,633
But that wasn't the place.

744
00:44:52,700 --> 00:44:54,767
Right?

745
00:44:54,767 --> 00:44:57,867
You can't possibly be of any help to my life.

746
00:44:58,867 --> 00:45:01,433
I guess I need to mobilize all my connections now.

747
00:45:01,433 --> 00:45:05,200
I'll ask Ju Yeon unnie, or I heard your brother is the CEO. So I'm sure he knows a lot of people.

748
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:07,967
Why? You saw a snake? Where is it?

749
00:45:07,967 --> 00:45:09,933
There?

750
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:13,233
I want to go to the bathroom.

751
00:45:13,233 --> 00:45:15,933
I think there's a bathroom if we go a little further.

752
00:45:15,933 --> 00:45:19,400
No, no. My stomach hurts.

753
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:23,000
You go there and keep a lookout.

754
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,767
Keep a lookout.

755
00:45:24,767 --> 00:45:27,967
Wow, seriously.

756
00:45:27,967 --> 00:45:31,467
- You're impossible to deal with. 
 - Go further. Go further.

757
00:45:31,467 --> 00:45:34,133
Oh, that's enough. There.

758
00:45:36,167 --> 00:45:39,700
Oh my, my stomach hurts so much.

759
00:45:39,700 --> 00:45:41,767
Really?

760
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:46,600
I'm giving this to you. Eat it.

761
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:48,033
What's this?

762
00:45:48,033 --> 00:45:51,933
You want me to eat this while smelling your poop?

763
00:45:52,967 --> 00:45:54,867
Just eat it.

764
00:45:54,867 --> 00:45:56,100
Oh, right.

765
00:45:56,100 --> 00:45:58,767
Just in case.

766
00:45:58,767 --> 00:46:00,167
You take all of this.

767
00:46:00,167 --> 00:46:02,410
What's this?

768
00:46:02,410 --> 00:46:04,633
And you also left your phone behind.

769
00:46:04,633 --> 00:46:06,733
Right.

770
00:46:08,733 --> 00:46:14,267
And since the caretakers come by here frequently, don't worry too much.

771
00:46:16,633 --> 00:46:19,467
There is a large temperature difference in the mountains.

772
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:22,033
What are you doing?

773
00:46:22,033 --> 00:46:26,567
How long will it take to poop? Are you constipated?

774
00:46:26,567 --> 00:46:29,333
I held my poop in for a long time.

775
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:34,833
Do you see that red ribbon tied to that tree over there?

776
00:46:35,667 --> 00:46:38,767
Having red ribbons like that on the trees makes it look totally like Christmas.

777
00:46:38,767 --> 00:46:39,833
Did you tie it?

778
00:46:39,833 --> 00:46:42,333
No, I didn't do it.

779
00:46:42,333 --> 00:46:45,667
Mountaineers tied them there, so we wouldn't get lost.

780
00:46:45,667 --> 00:46:47,600
There's one over there too.

781
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:50,100
If by any chance you are left alone in the mountains.

782
00:46:50,100 --> 00:46:53,100
- You know? 
 - Yes.

783
00:46:53,833 --> 00:46:56,867
Keep watch here quickly. I will answer the call of nature. Okay?

784
00:46:56,867 --> 00:46:58,333
Turn around, turn around.

785
00:46:58,333 --> 00:46:59,633
Are you seriously…

786
00:46:59,633 --> 00:47:03,633
Are you really about to… Are you seriously going to poop right here?

787
00:47:03,633 --> 00:47:04,633
Yeah.

788
00:47:04,633 --> 00:47:06,900
What are you doing? Let's just go to the restroom.

789
00:47:06,900 --> 00:47:11,367
Hey, I'm really going to poop. I unbuttoned it and unzipped it, so don't look.

790
00:47:11,367 --> 00:47:13,867
Don't do it. I hate it. I really hate it.

791
00:47:17,667 --> 00:47:21,567
Is this how parents feel when they leave their children behind?

792
00:47:22,600 --> 00:47:24,867
No, no, no.

793
00:47:24,867 --> 00:47:28,100
Yeah, you'll feel better if I'm not looking for you.

794
00:47:28,100 --> 00:47:31,167
This is for the good of everyone.

795
00:47:38,100 --> 00:47:40,333
 This is the recreation forest near the rest area. 

796
00:47:40,333 --> 00:47:44,000
 I'll send you the location, so you can come this way. 

797
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:47,667
Okay.

798
00:47:50,533 --> 00:47:54,000
Are Kun and Ju Yeon coming?

799
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,433
   

800
00:48:09,733 --> 00:48:12,900
Hey, you stepped in poop. Right?

801
00:48:12,900 --> 00:48:15,667
Hey, I think something bit me.

802
00:48:15,667 --> 00:48:17,233
I feel like a snake has bitten me.

803
00:48:17,233 --> 00:48:20,433
Hey, what should we do? There was a sign back there saying that snakes come out.

804
00:48:20,433 --> 00:48:21,800
Hey, hey.

805
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:25,433
Then, call 911 quickly, hurry!

806
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:32,000
Yes, this is near the walking trail by the recreational forest.

807
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,033
We climbed up about 20 minutes.

808
00:48:34,033 --> 00:48:37,900
I think he was bitten by a snake. What should I do?

809
00:48:37,900 --> 00:48:39,600
30 minutes?

810
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:42,533
Hey, since I can't see it, you take a look.

811
00:48:42,533 --> 00:48:44,200
No, are you crazy?

812
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:48,733
No, not my butt, higher up. Higher! Hurry!

813
00:48:48,733 --> 00:48:52,067
Hey, I actually haven't even pooped.

814
00:48:52,067 --> 00:48:54,267
Then, I'm sorry, but please come as quickly as possible.

815
00:48:54,267 --> 00:48:57,133
Yes, yes. I'm sorry.

816
00:48:57,133 --> 00:48:59,800
They might not be able to find this place.

817
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:02,500
I'll go and bring them here. Okay?

818
00:49:02,500 --> 00:49:05,300
I think I'm dying now.

819
00:49:05,300 --> 00:49:09,600
I've never lived my life the way I wanted.

820
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:12,767
And I haven't properly fallen in love yet.

821
00:49:12,767 --> 00:49:15,633
Dying while pooping in the mountains?

822
00:49:15,633 --> 00:49:18,167
Don't publish an obituary.

823
00:49:18,167 --> 00:49:20,733
At least I want to be remembered by people as an honorable person.

824
00:49:22,900 --> 00:49:25,833
It might not be a venomous snake.

825
00:49:27,233 --> 00:49:29,133
Now.

826
00:49:29,133 --> 00:49:32,967
You said there's a big temperature difference in the mountains.

827
00:49:32,967 --> 00:49:34,433
And.

828
00:49:34,433 --> 00:49:36,700
Thank you. I only have you.

829
00:49:36,700 --> 00:49:40,600
You'll feel a bit better now.

830
00:49:45,900 --> 00:49:48,167
It's good.

831
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:50,167
This is tasty.

832
00:49:50,167 --> 00:49:53,500
I can't believe that my last supper in life is chocolate.

833
00:49:58,467 --> 00:50:00,000
It's so cold.

834
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:03,033
It seems the poison is spreading through my body.

835
00:50:03,033 --> 00:50:06,100
I'll go and get someone to suck out your snake's venom.

836
00:50:06,100 --> 00:50:08,100
No, no.

837
00:50:08,100 --> 00:50:09,467
Don't leave me alone.

838
00:50:09,467 --> 00:50:11,633
I don't want to die alone. No, no.

839
00:50:11,633 --> 00:50:13,533
There will surely be a male caretaker nearby.

840
00:50:13,533 --> 00:50:16,867
If not, I'll go find a wild man.

841
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:22,533
Hey, it looks like I'm being punished for my bad deeds.

842
00:50:22,533 --> 00:50:23,633
What?

843
00:50:23,633 --> 00:50:27,700
Actually, I contacted your dad to come pick you up.

844
00:50:27,700 --> 00:50:30,533
What? You!

845
00:50:31,933 --> 00:50:34,233
Forgive me.

846
00:50:38,733 --> 00:50:41,500
It's gotten much shorter, but you have thin wrists.

847
00:50:44,767 --> 00:50:46,467
And,

848
00:50:46,467 --> 00:50:49,200
I know the person you're looking for.

849
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:52,767
Really? How do you know my real dad?

850
00:50:52,767 --> 00:50:54,600
Real dad?

851
00:50:54,600 --> 00:50:56,467
You said you know the person I'm looking for?

852
00:50:56,467 --> 00:50:57,800
I'm looking for my dad.

853
00:50:57,800 --> 00:50:59,300
Not your first love?

854
00:50:59,300 --> 00:51:01,833
Who is my first love?

855
00:51:05,633 --> 00:51:07,133
Jeon Sae Yan.

856
00:51:07,133 --> 00:51:09,433
The poison is spreading.

857
00:51:12,367 --> 00:51:16,567
Lee Shin, you can't die. Pull yourself together.

858
00:51:16,567 --> 00:51:20,133
Hey, Lee Shin, are you okay?

859
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:28,600
Ah, seriously.

860
00:51:28,600 --> 00:51:31,800
Hey, Lee Shin.

861
00:51:50,367 --> 00:51:52,300
It's not a snake bite. It's a bee sting.

862
00:51:52,300 --> 00:51:55,700
If you don't have any specific allergies, there shouldn't be a problem.

863
00:51:55,700 --> 00:51:58,400
But your guardian is quite remarkable.

864
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:01,333
You thought he was bitten by a snake, and you sucked out the poison for him.

865
00:52:03,533 --> 00:52:07,500
Then, we'll get going.

866
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:21,267
- Thank you. 
 - Thank you.

867
00:52:24,333 --> 00:52:27,633
Sae Yan, what happened?

868
00:52:27,633 --> 00:52:31,200
Nothing happened.

869
00:52:34,500 --> 00:52:36,200
What on earth are you two up to?

870
00:52:36,200 --> 00:52:38,167
Why did you just leave us at the rest area?

871
00:52:38,167 --> 00:52:43,167
And what happened here so that an ambulance came?

872
00:52:46,067 --> 00:52:52,500
   

873
00:52:55,633 --> 00:52:59,000
What's up? What happened?

874
00:53:00,067 --> 00:53:02,000
What's wrong?

875
00:53:03,533 --> 00:53:06,133
We're out of gas.

876
00:53:06,133 --> 00:53:07,700
What?

877
00:53:07,700 --> 00:53:09,533
I mean…

878
00:53:11,133 --> 00:53:15,233
I told you earlier that I needed to fill up with gas.

879
00:53:15,233 --> 00:53:17,000
I mean…

880
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:20,333
What should we do? We need to be there by 5:00.

881
00:53:29,800 --> 00:53:31,600
See! See!

882
00:53:31,600 --> 00:53:33,433
I knew this would happen.

883
00:53:33,433 --> 00:53:35,333
Are they the only ones who haven't come yet?

884
00:53:35,333 --> 00:53:38,400
Oh, seriously.

885
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:40,833
We only have 30 minutes left.

886
00:53:40,833 --> 00:53:43,533
Ah, these guys.

887
00:53:43,533 --> 00:53:44,567
 The line is busy… 

888
00:53:44,567 --> 00:53:48,300
Oh my, they're on a call again.

889
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:52,300
 The line is currently… 

890
00:53:52,300 --> 00:53:55,700
Ah, these guys are driving me crazy.

891
00:53:55,700 --> 00:53:58,500
Aren't we going to be late?

892
00:54:00,467 --> 00:54:03,800
How could you forget to refuel?

893
00:54:04,767 --> 00:54:07,267
It's Guk Bong again.

894
00:54:07,267 --> 00:54:11,400
What will happen to us by the time the tow car arrives?

895
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:14,000
We'll be kicked out one by one.

896
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:17,800
If Lee Shin can't get there, little cutie will also be out of the team.

897
00:54:17,800 --> 00:54:21,600
Then there's no need for a team doctor.

898
00:54:33,433 --> 00:54:36,233
Hey, little cutie.

899
00:54:36,233 --> 00:54:38,267
Cha Si On?

900
00:54:49,433 --> 00:54:51,767
Coach. Yes, I'm talking to you!

901
00:54:51,767 --> 00:54:54,833
If they are late again today, you’ll be the first to go!

902
00:54:54,833 --> 00:54:56,933
Okay, okay! I can do it.

903
00:54:56,933 --> 00:54:59,333
Come on. Move, move!

904
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:17,133
They are here.

905
00:55:17,133 --> 00:55:20,467
She came here. He came here.

906
00:55:21,700 --> 00:55:24,100
No problem. It's okay?

907
00:55:25,400 --> 00:55:27,567
It feels like a month has passed even though nothing has started yet.

908
00:55:27,567 --> 00:55:29,933
Come quickly, hurry.

909
00:55:37,233 --> 00:55:39,667
That's a relief.

910
00:56:02,367 --> 00:56:06,700
You still have a lingering attachment to the sport, right?

911
00:56:13,367 --> 00:56:16,033
You can be honest.

912
00:56:19,767 --> 00:56:21,667
Let's go.

913
00:57:00,433 --> 00:57:03,100
Is this where you want to stop by?

914
00:57:03,100 --> 00:57:05,133
Do you remember?

915
00:57:06,533 --> 00:57:09,000
The place where we first met.

916
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,200
15 years ago.

917
00:57:12,133 --> 00:57:14,300
The place where you saved me.

918
00:57:14,300 --> 00:57:19,233
A place where memories with you are preserved intact.

919
00:57:24,567 --> 00:57:27,067
You asked if I was okay. Right?

920
00:57:27,933 --> 00:57:33,467
You also asked if I had no more regrets about you.

921
00:57:36,200 --> 00:57:39,800
I'm trying to show my feelings now.

922
00:57:39,800 --> 00:57:43,900
I'm trying not to lie to myself or you anymore.

923
00:57:44,667 --> 00:57:47,467
I will reveal and show everything...

924
00:57:48,333 --> 00:57:51,633
more proudly and confidently.

925
00:57:54,500 --> 00:57:56,633
I…

926
00:57:57,800 --> 00:58:00,767
I can't do that.

927
00:58:00,767 --> 00:58:03,433
I don't have the right to do that.

928
00:58:06,233 --> 00:58:08,633
I'm sorry.

929
00:58:08,633 --> 00:58:10,533
That's a lie.

930
00:58:15,433 --> 00:58:18,133
Look into my eyes and say it.

931
00:58:18,133 --> 00:58:19,900
If that's the truth,

932
00:58:19,900 --> 00:58:22,633
look into my eyes and say it clearly.

933
00:58:34,867 --> 00:58:37,767
You are such a fool.

934
00:58:39,300 --> 00:58:41,533
Even if you deceive me,

935
00:58:42,267 --> 00:58:44,900
don't lie to yourself.

936
00:58:46,633 --> 00:58:49,067
Let's stop pretending...

937
00:58:50,667 --> 00:58:52,733
we're okay.

938
00:58:55,533 --> 00:59:03,067
♫  You light a small light in a corner  ♫

939
00:59:03,067 --> 00:59:09,767
♫  Of my heart that I had ignored  ♫

940
00:59:09,767 --> 00:59:17,367
♫  Where will it be, that day  ♫

941
00:59:17,367 --> 00:59:25,100
♫  How much further do I have to go before I can see  ♫

942
00:59:25,100 --> 00:59:31,600
♫  Even if that unreachable dream  ♫

943
00:59:31,600 --> 00:59:39,700
♫  Turns away from me and becomes more blurred  ♫

944
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:46,870
♫  I will walk towards that day  ♫

945
00:59:46,870 --> 00:59:57,150


946
00:59:57,150 --> 01:00:02,100
   

947
01:00:02,100 --> 01:00:04,333
 Even if everything changes, there are some things that don't change. 

948
01:00:04,333 --> 01:00:05,867
 If it's okay with you, we… 

949
01:00:05,867 --> 01:00:07,933
 Don't even think about sneaking in some skinship. 

950
01:00:07,933 --> 01:00:11,033
 What are the side effects? I need to figure that out, so I can steal the research. 

951
01:00:11,033 --> 01:00:12,400
 Now I'm in big trouble. 

952
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:14,433
 There's nothing we can do. We're already in the same boat. 

953
01:00:14,433 --> 01:00:16,333
 I sent something important yesterday. 

954
01:00:16,333 --> 01:00:18,767
 Jealousy is also a natural emotion. 

955
01:00:18,767 --> 01:00:21,333
 I feel like I'm going to die of embarrassment. 

956
01:00:21,333 --> 01:00:23,567
 I've come this far by deceiving people. 

957
01:00:23,567 --> 01:00:26,600
 I feel like I'm about to be exposed as just someone who's only flashy on the outside. 

958
01:00:26,600 --> 01:00:28,233
 Mr. Lee, are you okay? 

959
01:00:28,233 --> 01:00:30,867
 Let's admit it together and be honest. 

960
01:00:30,867 --> 01:00:34,767
 If you want to love, don't hold back for a moment.
