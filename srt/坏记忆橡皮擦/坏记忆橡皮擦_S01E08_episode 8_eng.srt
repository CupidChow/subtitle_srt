00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:17,980

00:00:25,433 --> 00:00:33,300

8
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:13,067
Hello, I am Jeon Sae Yan, your interpreter for the day.

9
00:01:13,067 --> 00:01:15,160
Please take care of me.

10
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:16,460
Well...

11
00:01:17,333 --> 00:01:19,800
Nice to meet you.

12
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:22,467
 First love, so what? 

13
00:01:22,467 --> 00:01:24,433
What?

14
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:27,900
Dr. Kyeong Ju Yeon is my brother's first love.

15
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:29,300
So what?

16
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:33,133
Right, we kissed in the hotel parking lot that night.

17
00:01:33,133 --> 00:01:35,833
It seems he saw that.

18
00:01:35,833 --> 00:01:38,600
So, what does it matter?

19
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,367
You bastard…

20
00:01:40,367 --> 00:01:43,400
Now that I think about it, you did that on purpose. Right?

21
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:45,800
You showed up at Kun's alumni reunion purposely,

22
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:48,133
and you hit on Kun's first love on purpose. Right?

23
00:01:48,133 --> 00:01:50,767
Don't you feel sorry?

24
00:01:50,767 --> 00:01:51,900
Why should I be sorry?

25
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:53,900
You bastard…

26
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:56,433
Are you okay?

27
00:01:56,433 --> 00:01:58,367
That's not it. I'll explain everything.

28
00:01:58,367 --> 00:02:01,333
We're not in a romantic relationship.

29
00:02:01,333 --> 00:02:03,867
Coincidentally, it was an underground parking lot, so my brother misunderstood.

30
00:02:03,867 --> 00:02:06,167
At that time, I didn't even know who my brother's first love was.

31
00:02:06,167 --> 00:02:09,033
I don't understand why I have to explain this to you in such detail.

32
00:02:09,033 --> 00:02:13,533
I'll think of it as your concern for my brother that you grabbed me by the collar.

33
00:02:13,533 --> 00:02:15,267
Okay.

34
00:02:15,267 --> 00:02:17,133
Even if what you said is true,

35
00:02:17,133 --> 00:02:21,700
shouldn't you two not meet anymore?

36
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:24,067
Seeing the two of you might bring back the bad memories he had erased.

37
00:02:24,067 --> 00:02:26,300
All have been erased. The bad memories.

38
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:27,933
The relationship between me and his first love.

39
00:02:27,933 --> 00:02:29,933
Him ending his career as a player instead of me.

40
00:02:29,933 --> 00:02:33,000
And falling into the river because of me.

41
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,800
If there were any bad memories left,

42
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,967
he wouldn't have called his first love to be the team doctor.

43
00:02:37,967 --> 00:02:41,367
And he wouldn't have made eye contact with me, like in the old days.

44
00:02:41,367 --> 00:02:43,700
So don't make a big deal out of it.

45
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:47,100
I'm the one who's afraid his memories might come back.

46
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:50,400
Don't act too excessively and watch your mouth.

47
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,367
Where is Lee Shin?­

48
00:02:53,367 --> 00:02:55,700
He asked when Player Lee Shin would be here?

49
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:58,700
With an agitated voice.

50
00:02:59,567 --> 00:03:01,933
- If I get caught in this… 
  - Lee Shin, why aren't you here? 

51
00:03:01,933 --> 00:03:03,467
Why isn't Shin coming?

52
00:03:03,467 --> 00:03:06,100
If this happens, won't both of us be cut from the doubles selection?

53
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:09,200
What are they saying?

54
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:16,233
They said, "Coach, would you like to experience Korean culture?"

55
00:03:16,233 --> 00:03:21,333
In Korea, we brew our own coffee.

56
00:03:21,333 --> 00:03:22,867
"Dalgona coffee," that's what it's called.

57
00:03:22,867 --> 00:03:25,667
- "Dalgona?" 
 - Dalgona.

58
00:03:25,667 --> 00:03:28,033
Dalgona coffee.

59
00:03:28,933 --> 00:03:31,300
Dalgona coffee.

60
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:33,167
It's easy to make.

61
00:03:33,167 --> 00:03:39,333
Add coffee powder and sugar in a 1:1 ratio.

62
00:03:39,333 --> 00:03:43,867
Add a little water.

63
00:03:43,867 --> 00:03:48,800
And now, stir it like this.

64
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:51,840
 (Me?)­ 

65
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,200
- Like this? 
 - Yeah.

66
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:57,600
We gained some time, but that's going to be really tough.

67
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:00,733
Wouldn't that make things worse?

68
00:04:00,733 --> 00:04:03,900
What are you doing? Go and look for him quickly.

69
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:10,000
Like this, like this.

70
00:04:13,167 --> 00:04:17,600
Why did you lie? You know I'm not his first love.

71
00:04:19,633 --> 00:04:21,933
Because I think

72
00:04:21,933 --> 00:04:25,100
I know why you had to lie.

73
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:28,867
It's here.

74
00:04:28,867 --> 00:04:31,133
The place where I saved my brother.

75
00:04:32,567 --> 00:04:36,467
My brother cried out just before the accident.

76
00:04:36,467 --> 00:04:39,600
He said he wanted to forget everything if it couldn't be undone.

77
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,700
He said it as if he was dead already.

78
00:04:43,733 --> 00:04:46,167
My brother, who was my idol when I was young,

79
00:04:46,167 --> 00:04:50,267
lost his successful career as a player because of me.

80
00:04:50,267 --> 00:04:55,933
It was so painful to see him change into someone with so many complexes.

81
00:04:55,933 --> 00:04:59,967
So I went to Professor Han that day, and got on my knees and begged.

82
00:04:59,967 --> 00:05:02,900
To please let him participate in that clinical trial.

83
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:06,400
To erase those bad memories.

84
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:09,500
Saying I'd take any side effects.

85
00:05:10,833 --> 00:05:14,733
At first, I thought it was for the sake of the subject,

86
00:05:14,733 --> 00:05:18,133
but it became more and more agonizing.

87
00:05:18,133 --> 00:05:20,133
I lied to him,

88
00:05:20,133 --> 00:05:23,300
but every time he looks at me with sincerity.

89
00:05:25,167 --> 00:05:28,200
Fortunately, not now.

90
00:05:28,933 --> 00:05:33,167
Besides these side effects, doesn't he look really happy?

91
00:05:33,167 --> 00:05:35,300
It's thanks to you that he has become happy.

92
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:37,733
Don't blame yourself.

93
00:05:37,733 --> 00:05:40,500
You did it for your brother.

94
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,533
Let's do it together.

95
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:53,267
He's happy and I'm happy because everything worked out just as we wanted.

96
00:05:53,267 --> 00:05:57,167
So, don't struggle alone, pretending you're his first love.

97
00:05:57,167 --> 00:05:59,567
I'll also do anything.

98
00:05:59,567 --> 00:06:02,500
So that my brother's bad memories won't come back.

99
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:05,300
For my brother's happiness.

100
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:09,100
Cooperation, let's do that.

101
00:06:10,567 --> 00:06:12,333
- Oh, Kun. 
 - Right.

102
00:06:12,333 --> 00:06:14,133
Where's Lee Shin?

103
00:06:14,133 --> 00:06:17,533
Lee Shin? Actually, it's…

104
00:06:17,533 --> 00:06:21,200
He came earlier and then left, saying there was an urgent matter.

105
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:23,367
He came and left?

106
00:06:23,367 --> 00:06:26,700
What could be more urgent than this right now?

107
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:29,267
Ah, I'm really going crazy.

108
00:06:29,267 --> 00:06:33,567
But I bet he'll be grateful to your company?

109
00:06:33,567 --> 00:06:37,050
Because your team doctor introduced an interpreter to us.

110
00:06:37,767 --> 00:06:41,300
That interpreter was recommended by our team doctor?

111
00:06:44,767 --> 00:06:48,633
That first love, the real first love.

112
00:06:48,633 --> 00:06:51,133
The person you said you kissed.

113
00:06:51,133 --> 00:06:52,967
Are you still in contact now?

114
00:06:52,967 --> 00:06:57,267
His first true love could be the trigger for all his bad memories.

115
00:06:57,267 --> 00:07:00,633
If he runs into her, even if he doesn't remember right away,

116
00:07:00,633 --> 00:07:04,767
all his memories might unfold like dominoes at any moment.

117
00:07:04,767 --> 00:07:08,300
She hasn't met him since then.

118
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:11,567
No, I mean… Now that I've become aware of her existence,

119
00:07:11,567 --> 00:07:16,133
I think I'll feel a little better if I explain the situation and ask for consent.

120
00:07:16,133 --> 00:07:18,833
Since you said you two were dating, the social media…

121
00:07:18,833 --> 00:07:20,733
Dating?

122
00:07:20,733 --> 00:07:23,700
There really wasn't anything between us.

123
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:26,533
I totally got kissed without wanting to.

124
00:07:31,267 --> 00:07:34,967
Anyway, you aren't my brother's first love.

125
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:40,167
I knew you wouldn't be his type.

126
00:07:40,690 --> 00:07:42,550
­I see.

127
00:07:43,333 --> 00:07:47,033
His taste in women was completely opposite to mine.

128
00:07:47,033 --> 00:07:49,200
As expected.

129
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,500
I've never had such delicious coffee before.

130
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,567
- Is it good? 
 - It's incredibly good.

131
00:08:00,567 --> 00:08:03,300
- Cheers. 
 - Cheers.

132
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:09,933
It's the third one. Amazing.

133
00:08:09,933 --> 00:08:12,500
Oh, my arm hurts.

134
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:16,733
Think of it as the first training schedule.

135
00:08:16,733 --> 00:08:20,500
He said you worked your arms, so you can consider this your first workout.

136
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:23,800
Coach, you are now an insider!

137
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:24,833
An insider?

138
00:08:24,833 --> 00:08:27,367
It means someone trendy.

139
00:08:27,367 --> 00:08:29,400
An insider? An insider!

140
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,900
- An insider! 
 - An insider!

141
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,333
An insider.

142
00:08:37,333 --> 00:08:39,300
   

143
00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:41,830
   

144
00:08:43,133 --> 00:08:46,433
You said there was a meeting with the coach today.

145
00:08:46,433 --> 00:08:51,933
It's okay for a star player like me.

146
00:08:51,933 --> 00:08:56,233
Ah, right! No, why didn't you show up for the lunch appointment yesterday?

147
00:08:56,233 --> 00:08:59,033
I waited for quite a while.

148
00:09:00,733 --> 00:09:02,733
Are you planning to eat double today?

149
00:09:02,733 --> 00:09:03,767
What?

150
00:09:03,767 --> 00:09:06,050
If we're going to collaborate,

151
00:09:06,833 --> 00:09:09,200
we have to get our stories straight.

152
00:09:11,567 --> 00:09:12,933
Let's go.

153
00:09:12,933 --> 00:09:17,033
For cooperation, a delicious restaurant is the best.

154
00:09:17,033 --> 00:09:21,233
Thank you for thinking of your brother.

155
00:09:21,233 --> 00:09:24,200
Why? It's for my brother.

156
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:26,967
As his family, I should be more grateful to you.

157
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:32,233
Of course.

158
00:09:32,233 --> 00:09:34,300
Let's go.

159
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:41,867
But the big data was very impressive. Unbelievable.

160
00:09:41,867 --> 00:09:45,333
He said the big data was very impressive.

161
00:09:45,333 --> 00:09:47,600
I'm really glad it was helpful.

162
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,133
I'm really glad it was helpful.

163
00:09:50,133 --> 00:09:51,667
A total insider, ciao!

164
00:09:51,667 --> 00:09:55,000
- A total insider. 
 - A total insider, ciao!

165
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,233
The first money I earned from working!

166
00:10:02,233 --> 00:10:06,000
What? Am I a career woman now, or what?

167
00:10:07,667 --> 00:10:09,900
Ju Yeon? Sis, where are you?

168
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:13,067
What do you want to eat? Tell me everything. I'll buy it all for you.

169
00:10:13,067 --> 00:10:15,267
You left?

170
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:20,900
Okay, I will head home. See you at home, all right.

171
00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:25,467
She left.

172
00:10:51,267 --> 00:10:54,300
Why, what? You hit someone?

173
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:57,667
When did you get in?

174
00:10:57,667 --> 00:10:58,800
Weren't we supposed to go together?

175
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,467
- What? 
 - I thought you were giving me a ride.

176
00:11:00,467 --> 00:11:03,667
- Who? 
 - This lady is totally giving off a cool vibe.

177
00:11:03,667 --> 00:11:04,867
You're my style!

178
00:11:04,867 --> 00:11:07,133
You're my style, too!

179
00:11:07,133 --> 00:11:09,100
Crazy.

180
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:19,300
The meeting is all over, but he hasn't contacted me at all.

181
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:21,500
Gosh.

182
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:23,630
I don't know.

183
00:11:33,833 --> 00:11:36,533
 Did the meeting go well? 

184
00:11:38,233 --> 00:11:40,100
No, no.

185
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:41,567
 Was the interpreter okay? 

186
00:11:41,567 --> 00:11:43,567
No, no.

187
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:47,230
 What time should I start work tomorrow? 

188
00:11:47,230 --> 00:11:51,700
♫  Some word made you change  ♫

189
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:54,067
I don't know.

190
00:11:54,867 --> 00:11:57,150
How should I send it?

191
00:11:57,150 --> 00:12:00,330
♫  I can't even say I don't know what to do or I'm nervous ♫

192
00:12:00,330 --> 00:12:01,600
Are you sleeping?

193
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:05,867
No, that sounds like something an ex-boyfriend would send.

194
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:12,400
I heard you introduced an interpreter to our company?

195
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:16,300
Oh, no, this is not it. This sounds too cold.

196
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:20,000
The interpreter is sleeping now.

197
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,800
So, come get her.

198
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:26,100
No, please come and get her.

199
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:28,533
What would be good?

200
00:12:28,533 --> 00:12:31,470
Come and, come and...

201
00:12:31,470 --> 00:12:34,200
What the...!

202
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:38,000
 ­  

203
00:12:46,333 --> 00:12:47,767
   

204
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:51,500
"The interpreter is sleeping now. So come and get her?"

205
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:54,433
"Come and get her?"

206
00:12:54,433 --> 00:12:57,700
He didn't even say thank you and now he's ordering me around?

207
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:00,367
Those eyes… Those eyes!

208
00:13:00,367 --> 00:13:03,067
Do you think this is a taxi?

209
00:13:03,067 --> 00:13:07,700
Since you sleep so well, I'm worried that it's dangerous for you to take a taxi alone.

210
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:09,867
Did I mention the address?

211
00:13:09,867 --> 00:13:12,400
How did you know I live here?

212
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:15,933
Aren't you living with Dr. Kyeong Ju Yeon?

213
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:18,800
That bracelet…

214
00:13:20,667 --> 00:13:23,767
How did you know Ju Yeon gave me this?

215
00:13:23,767 --> 00:13:28,467
So why did she have to use my wrist, getting me excited for nothing.

216
00:13:28,467 --> 00:13:29,933
Thank you for giving me a ride.

217
00:13:29,933 --> 00:13:32,133
No, no, no.

218
00:13:32,133 --> 00:13:37,500
Why don't you call Ju Yeon to come pick you up?

219
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:42,400
No way.

220
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:44,267
Why? What, what? Why?

221
00:13:44,267 --> 00:13:46,367
No way.

222
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:48,467
You were worried about me walking alone at night?

223
00:13:48,467 --> 00:13:51,600
Oh, what? You're even sweeter than I heard.

224
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,367
You're a sweet guy.

225
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:56,130
Ah...­

226
00:13:56,130 --> 00:14:01,533
I mean, I am a man who's sweet and sugary.

227
00:14:01,533 --> 00:14:06,433
What does Dr. Kyeong usually say about me

228
00:14:06,433 --> 00:14:08,833
that you know me so well?

229
00:14:08,833 --> 00:14:10,633
So,

230
00:14:10,633 --> 00:14:13,067
does Dr. Kyeong

231
00:14:13,067 --> 00:14:17,000
like the sweet type?

232
00:14:18,433 --> 00:14:22,800
Haven't we seen each other somewhere? You look familiar.

233
00:14:26,730 --> 00:14:28,533
No, no.

234
00:14:28,533 --> 00:14:30,633
Probably not.

235
00:14:38,330 --> 00:14:39,733
Hey, Lee Shin! Where are you?

236
00:14:39,733 --> 00:14:41,167
- No, look at this. 
 - Yes, you did a good job.

237
00:14:41,167 --> 00:14:42,667
- It's real money. 
 - Yeah, I got it.

238
00:14:42,667 --> 00:14:45,200
Hey, you wait.

239
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:49,067
But it was easier with an interpreter. Right?

240
00:14:56,867 --> 00:15:02,000
   

241
00:15:03,433 --> 00:15:05,833
Look!

242
00:15:05,833 --> 00:15:09,667
I was in full career woman mode.

243
00:15:09,667 --> 00:15:11,133
It's my first time earning money.

244
00:15:11,133 --> 00:15:16,133
So I didn't know what they meant when they said that beer after work tasted good.

245
00:15:16,133 --> 00:15:17,567
Now I got to know.

246
00:15:17,567 --> 00:15:20,500
I learned the joy of making money.

247
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:23,867
So the CEO said thank you and took you home?

248
00:15:23,867 --> 00:15:25,300
I don't think so.

249
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:27,733
I worked my butt off, but there wasn't even a single 'thank you'?

250
00:15:27,733 --> 00:15:30,333
Right? That's what I'm saying.

251
00:15:30,333 --> 00:15:34,467
I don't want warm words. What's so difficult about saying common, ordinary words like 'thank you'?

252
00:15:34,467 --> 00:15:37,100
It's not like I'm showing off for introducing you to him.

253
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:39,880
I really put so much effort into it.

254
00:15:40,730 --> 00:15:43,667
But what do you call that?

255
00:15:43,667 --> 00:15:45,067
He acted careless on the outside,

256
00:15:45,067 --> 00:15:48,200
and he was sweeter than I thought.

257
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:50,133
'So sweet?'

258
00:15:50,133 --> 00:15:51,667
'So sweet'?

259
00:15:51,667 --> 00:15:53,667
Has all the sweetness in the world frozen to death?

260
00:15:53,667 --> 00:15:57,567
How can a sweet person just walk away when someone is dangling from a rehab device?

261
00:15:57,567 --> 00:16:00,133
He made me carry his heavy luggage just because it's heavy.

262
00:16:00,133 --> 00:16:04,567
'So sweet'? No, he's a person filled with extreme self-love.

263
00:16:04,567 --> 00:16:07,400
It's not even funny.

264
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:12,100
Date? Date?

265
00:16:16,833 --> 00:16:19,700
Okay, okay.

266
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:23,867
I'll go to the coach tomorrow and beg like this.

267
00:16:23,867 --> 00:16:27,200
There was a good reason for it today.

268
00:16:28,133 --> 00:16:30,367
I must be crazy. I must be crazy.

269
00:16:30,367 --> 00:16:31,700
Because I've fallen for a woman.

270
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:34,800
Oh, I got it, I got it.

271
00:16:38,267 --> 00:16:40,600
What happened to your lips?

272
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,867
Did you get punched in the face by that woman?

273
00:16:42,867 --> 00:16:45,500
Ah, this…

274
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:50,867
She put some medicine on my chapped lips like this.

275
00:16:53,733 --> 00:16:57,667
I don't know what kind of woman she is, but she has bad taste in men.

276
00:16:57,667 --> 00:17:00,433
Like our team doctor.

277
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:04,900
Oh!

278
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:07,733
Speaking of that team doctor.

279
00:17:07,733 --> 00:17:11,733
You don't still have feelings for her. Right?

280
00:17:15,133 --> 00:17:18,933
Ah, what is it? Dog hair!

281
00:17:18,933 --> 00:17:21,433
Why is the dog sleeping on the bed?

282
00:17:21,433 --> 00:17:24,667
What's the use of him looking in the mirror and doing this all the time?

283
00:17:24,667 --> 00:17:27,933
He pretends to be a man and acts like a crybaby.

284
00:17:27,933 --> 00:17:31,733
He was only slightly injured, but I thought something big had happened.

285
00:17:31,733 --> 00:17:33,767
Hey, you're in big trouble.

286
00:17:33,767 --> 00:17:35,700
You need to improve your taste in men.

287
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:38,800
They say overreacting like that is even more suspicious.

288
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:41,500
Oh my, what's suspicious?

289
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:44,333
I have to sleep early for my first day at work tomorrow.

290
00:17:44,333 --> 00:17:46,367
Turn off the lights.

291
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:53,833
 Did you really erase me from your heart? 

292
00:17:53,833 --> 00:17:54,900
 That… 

293
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:56,100
 Are you sure? 

294
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:58,333
 Of course. 

295
00:17:58,333 --> 00:18:03,433
 Does that mean I can like you again? 

296
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:10,100
 It's a dream, so what does it matter? 

297
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:36,567
Hey!

298
00:18:36,567 --> 00:18:39,200
No way, my lips!

299
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,667
My pure lips.

300
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:52,967
Where did you go? Where did you go!

301
00:18:52,967 --> 00:18:54,733
Hey!

302
00:18:54,733 --> 00:18:57,933
I don't have any memories of kissing right now.

303
00:18:57,933 --> 00:18:59,500
How could you kiss my lips?

304
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:02,433
Isn't that too much?

305
00:19:02,433 --> 00:19:05,533
Because of you... Because of you, it was all a crazy dream.

306
00:19:05,533 --> 00:19:08,367
You're banned from approaching me from now on.

307
00:19:08,367 --> 00:19:12,100
Ugh, it's disgusting.

308
00:19:17,267 --> 00:19:18,567
Yes, Professor Han.

309
00:19:18,567 --> 00:19:21,833
Today is my official first day of work.

310
00:19:21,833 --> 00:19:23,967
Yes, I'm about to start the counseling.

311
00:19:23,967 --> 00:19:26,667
I will drop by the hospital later.

312
00:19:26,667 --> 00:19:29,433
 You seem excited? 

313
00:19:29,433 --> 00:19:31,467
Me?

314
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:44,767
 You usually keep your distance from everyone. 

315
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:47,133
 Don't get emotionally involved with patients. 

316
00:19:47,133 --> 00:19:53,200
 You know that whether you feel good or bad, you have to act rationally. Right? 

317
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,267
Here it is.

318
00:19:58,933 --> 00:20:00,200
I…

319
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,600
Oh, right. I have to pay for it.

320
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:03,900
What are you doing?

321
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:06,100
Ah, just in case.

322
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:09,833
A man and a woman together so I guess I should do this much.

323
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:11,250
Gosh.

324
00:20:13,833 --> 00:20:15,933
During the three months of working here,

325
00:20:15,933 --> 00:20:18,567
daily counseling, sleep tests once a week, EEG tests,

326
00:20:18,567 --> 00:20:19,700
you just have to adhere to these conditions.

327
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:21,500
Is there anything else?

328
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:24,100
Like no physical contact between men and women.

329
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:28,533
To begin with, it's not a relationship between men and women, we're just colleagues.

330
00:20:28,533 --> 00:20:30,900
Now, let's start the counseling.

331
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:33,433
All right, sit comfortably in a relaxed posture.

332
00:20:33,433 --> 00:20:35,667
- Is this it? 
 - Oh, this is so good.

333
00:20:35,667 --> 00:20:39,867
Then first, you have to write an emotion diary.

334
00:20:39,867 --> 00:20:42,400
You just write down all the emotions you feel.

335
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,267
Here.

336
00:20:45,567 --> 00:20:47,100
Yes, I got it.

337
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:50,267
Write comfortably. I'll be waiting.

338
00:20:56,167 --> 00:20:57,267
- Did you finish writing it already? 
 - Is it done?

339
00:20:57,267 --> 00:20:59,200
Yes.

340
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,667
No.

341
00:21:07,667 --> 00:21:10,600
I didn't ask you to scribble!

342
00:21:13,633 --> 00:21:15,433
You don't listen at all.

343
00:21:15,433 --> 00:21:17,633
"Extremely unlucky?"

344
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:23,233
"The subject is full of self-esteem and annoying due to self-adoration?"

345
00:21:23,233 --> 00:21:24,367
Are you going to write like this?

346
00:21:24,367 --> 00:21:26,300
Rather than an observation diary,

347
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:29,067
it's just notes that I have made so far.

348
00:21:29,067 --> 00:21:32,067
My honest feelings about the subject.

349
00:21:32,067 --> 00:21:33,900
I told you not to be emotional.

350
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:36,500
It's only your personal feelings without any medical opinion.

351
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:38,767
I haven't even counseled yet.

352
00:21:38,767 --> 00:21:41,500
Now we've just started working together day and night under one roof.

353
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:45,567
Now I have to formally counsel.

354
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:50,467
I think I should at least give you a necklace.

355
00:21:50,467 --> 00:21:52,967
Are you going on "Show Me the Money"?

356
00:21:52,967 --> 00:21:55,133
You're getting weirder.

357
00:21:55,133 --> 00:21:57,167
I'm saying this because I'm worried.

358
00:21:57,167 --> 00:21:59,300
If you stay with the subject day and night,

359
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:02,533
and once in a while, you start to feel strange emotions—

360
00:22:02,533 --> 00:22:04,952
What kind of emotions?

361
00:22:04,952 --> 00:22:06,200
Ah, you startled me.

362
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,167
Am I the kind of person who can't distinguish between public and private?

363
00:22:08,167 --> 00:22:11,367
And because of work, I don't have time to have romantic feelings.

364
00:22:11,367 --> 00:22:13,467
I study like a job seeker to observe the subject.

365
00:22:13,467 --> 00:22:15,367
Groveling to look good to the young athlete.

366
00:22:15,367 --> 00:22:17,433
See? I rubbed my palms so hard

367
00:22:17,433 --> 00:22:20,667
that palm lines have almost disappeared.

368
00:22:20,667 --> 00:22:23,767
The necklace suits you. You are an excellent rapper.

369
00:22:23,767 --> 00:22:28,167
What I'm saying is to separate your public and private life.

370
00:22:28,167 --> 00:22:29,667
Yes.

371
00:22:29,667 --> 00:22:31,767
Oh my.

372
00:22:31,767 --> 00:22:32,967
Professor, about that earlier…

373
00:22:32,967 --> 00:22:34,367
Oh my.

374
00:22:34,367 --> 00:22:35,800
Just a moment, please be careful.

375
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:38,400
It's heavy. Be careful, be careful.

376
00:22:40,567 --> 00:22:42,967
Oh, Dr. Kyeong is here too.

377
00:22:42,967 --> 00:22:46,367
Yes, then you two can talk comfortably.

378
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:56,400
You can distinguish between public and private, right?

379
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:59,367
Well, maybe you have feelings for Nurse Song?

380
00:22:59,367 --> 00:23:01,167
What did I do?

381
00:23:01,167 --> 00:23:04,467
As a coworker who has worked together for a long time.

382
00:23:04,467 --> 00:23:07,400
She is a single mom, and she has a hard time raising her children and working hard,

383
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:09,833
so isn't it only natural that I,

384
00:23:09,833 --> 00:23:13,200
a bachelor, would do this much for her?

385
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,767
Anyway.

386
00:23:14,767 --> 00:23:19,100
If you don't want to be misunderstood with the test subject, just keep it neutral.

387
00:23:20,867 --> 00:23:25,367
There won't be such a thing, so don't look at me with bias.

388
00:23:25,367 --> 00:23:27,733
And since I told him to write an emotion diary.

389
00:23:27,733 --> 00:23:32,533
I'll observe very rationally from the side.

390
00:23:32,533 --> 00:23:33,800
Wait a minute.

391
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:38,767
Come to think of it, when the test subject came for counseling 10 years ago,

392
00:23:38,767 --> 00:23:42,600
I told him to write an emotion diary, but I don't know if he did that.

393
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:45,233
What?

394
00:24:14,433 --> 00:24:16,567
Oh, look who's here.

395
00:24:16,567 --> 00:24:19,900
So you've come to beg the investors.

396
00:24:21,133 --> 00:24:24,133
It seems you think of fundraising as begging.

397
00:24:24,133 --> 00:24:29,567
That must be why there are rumors you're struggling financially.

398
00:24:29,567 --> 00:24:32,567
I have a close relationship with the chairman here.

399
00:24:32,567 --> 00:24:34,533
Good luck.

400
00:24:34,533 --> 00:24:36,967
You're wearing something nice?

401
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:43,433
You bastard.

402
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:50,833
Sir, why are you coming out?

403
00:24:50,833 --> 00:24:53,133
- Ah, Mr. Lee. 
 - How have you been?

404
00:24:53,133 --> 00:24:56,267
The chairman is waiting for your briefing, follow me.

405
00:24:56,267 --> 00:24:57,867
- Yes. 
 - Ah.

406
00:24:57,867 --> 00:25:00,233
Mr. Hong, wait here.

407
00:25:01,167 --> 00:25:03,967
Me? Not him?

408
00:25:10,267 --> 00:25:12,767
Go greet the chairman.

409
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:16,340
Ah.

410
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,700
I am Lee Kun, the CEO of 'Agency Goon'.

411
00:25:23,533 --> 00:25:27,633
Then, I'll start the business plan briefing.

412
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,833
Unlike other agencies, our 'Agency Goon'

413
00:25:34,833 --> 00:25:37,633
analyzes the big data of each player

414
00:25:37,633 --> 00:25:41,100
to prevent injuries and…

415
00:25:48,067 --> 00:25:49,733
Congratulations.

416
00:25:49,733 --> 00:25:51,067
Yes, thank you.

417
00:25:51,067 --> 00:25:52,900
This is all thanks to you, sir.

418
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:56,433
Now you need to be introduced to all the sponsors and advertising industry people.

419
00:25:56,433 --> 00:25:58,500
Oh, no.

420
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:00,333
How about a drink tonight?

421
00:26:00,333 --> 00:26:02,433
I have some places to stop by today.

422
00:26:02,433 --> 00:26:05,067
I will visit you again soon.

423
00:26:05,067 --> 00:26:07,233
- Let's do that. 
 - Yes, thank you.

424
00:26:07,233 --> 00:26:08,233
Don't forget!

425
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:09,800
Understood.

426
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:11,767
Thank you.

427
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,600
The investment you promised me last time…

428
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:25,233
Mr. Hong, what happened with the renewal of Player Lee Shin's contract?

429
00:26:25,233 --> 00:26:26,467
I will make sure of that soon…

430
00:26:26,467 --> 00:26:30,133
Let's talk again after you make him sign the contract.

431
00:26:30,133 --> 00:26:32,067
Sir!

432
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:36,533
Nothing works out because of that darned brother.

433
00:26:36,533 --> 00:26:40,933
But what brain surgery did he have to change his personality like that?

434
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:46,300
Even his gait has changed.

435
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:48,900
Let go. I said I'm going in.

436
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:51,500
You should have done that earlier.

437
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:53,967
You must do it today!

438
00:26:53,967 --> 00:26:55,100
No, but honey,

439
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:58,400
other people are watching and he's not a criminal.

440
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,567
- Holding him like this is… 
 - Honey, please.

441
00:26:59,567 --> 00:27:01,200
Hold on tight. Let's go.

442
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,400
Dad! Dad!

443
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:04,667
Oh my, Shin's mom.

444
00:27:04,667 --> 00:27:06,933
Oh, Shin. Did you come here for a medical test?

445
00:27:06,933 --> 00:27:10,767
- Hello. 
 - Hello.

446
00:27:10,767 --> 00:27:14,733
I thought this was a Miss Korea selection contest.

447
00:27:14,733 --> 00:27:18,333
Seems like everyone's here for the national team's medical test?

448
00:27:18,333 --> 00:27:22,867
Honey, take Shin and register it now.

449
00:27:22,867 --> 00:27:24,300
Yes.

450
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:26,667
Truth, goodness, beauty.

451
00:27:26,667 --> 00:27:28,833
Goodbye.

452
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:32,000
Shin always looks dashing.

453
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:36,733
You can say that Shin has already won the gold medal. I'm jealous of you.

454
00:27:37,567 --> 00:27:40,800
I'll give up the silver and bronze medals to you.

455
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:44,267
Now, if your eldest son does well, everything will be fine.

456
00:27:44,267 --> 00:27:45,433
That would be nice.

457
00:27:45,433 --> 00:27:49,067
Is he still cooped up at home drinking every day?

458
00:27:49,067 --> 00:27:51,733
Oh my, that worries me.

459
00:27:53,533 --> 00:27:55,067
Oh, Dr. Kyeong!

460
00:27:55,067 --> 00:27:57,433
Ah, hello.

461
00:27:57,433 --> 00:28:00,733
Today is the day Shin takes a medical test.

462
00:28:00,733 --> 00:28:03,367
Everyone here is a player's mother.

463
00:28:03,367 --> 00:28:04,967
But who is this?

464
00:28:04,967 --> 00:28:06,500
Oh, that…

465
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:10,767
Kun's… You know.

466
00:28:10,767 --> 00:28:12,867
Lover.

467
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:16,260
Goodness!

468
00:28:16,267 --> 00:28:20,967
Oh my, I envy you.

469
00:28:20,967 --> 00:28:22,833
Yes, I'm Mr. Lee Kun's attending—

470
00:28:22,833 --> 00:28:24,733
She was reunited with him as his attending physician.

471
00:28:24,733 --> 00:28:27,000
She was Kun's first love from childhood.

472
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,367
No, rather than a first love, it was…

473
00:28:29,367 --> 00:28:31,800
It's kind of puppy love.

474
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:35,967
Now, it's true love.

475
00:28:35,967 --> 00:28:37,900
What are you saying…

476
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:39,933
Oh, your face has turned red.

477
00:28:39,933 --> 00:28:43,033
An athlete as a son and a doctor as a daughter-in-law, it's just perfect.

478
00:28:43,033 --> 00:28:46,267
You've got everything.

479
00:28:46,833 --> 00:28:49,533
- No. 
 - Look, her face has gone red.

480
00:28:49,533 --> 00:28:52,467
Dr. Kyeong is so pretty, isn't she?

481
00:28:52,467 --> 00:28:54,433
No, no. It's not like that.

482
00:28:54,433 --> 00:28:56,467
- Dr. Ju Yeon? 
 - Miss Ju Yeon.

483
00:28:56,467 --> 00:28:58,500
When did she…

484
00:28:59,990 --> 00:29:02,000
 ­ 

485
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,533
You were here? You called me. Right?

486
00:29:05,533 --> 00:29:07,100
Yes.

487
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:08,300
Isn't he Player Lee Shin?

488
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:11,733
Isn't she your sister-in-law?

489
00:29:11,733 --> 00:29:13,700
She's my brother's attending physician.

490
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:17,333
She's my brother's former first love and unrequited love.

491
00:29:17,333 --> 00:29:21,367
You said you hadn't seen him once since he was discharged. Right?

492
00:29:21,367 --> 00:29:24,100
You go away.

493
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:27,300
How is it? I suit her better than my brother. Right?

494
00:29:29,430 --> 00:29:32,320
You prankster.

495
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:33,500
Well.

496
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:36,000
Why would you tell a lie that's bound to be found out?

497
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,233
I'll explain everything to them later.

498
00:29:39,233 --> 00:29:41,333
It's okay as long as I don't get caught by them.

499
00:29:41,333 --> 00:29:45,400
Then you won't be the only one being suspected?

500
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:47,600
If there's a scandal…

501
00:29:48,267 --> 00:29:51,267
Who do you think Lee Shin is?

502
00:29:51,267 --> 00:29:56,333
Even kids who don't know me pass by and say, "That's Player Lee Shin!"

503
00:29:56,333 --> 00:29:58,400
We're on the same team now.

504
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,767
Try saying 'Shin.'

505
00:30:01,433 --> 00:30:05,667
Oh! Have you ever seen Mr. Lee Kun's past diary?

506
00:30:05,667 --> 00:30:07,067
An emotion diary.

507
00:30:07,067 --> 00:30:11,333
I heard that when he was consulting with a professor, he asked him to write that down.

508
00:30:11,333 --> 00:30:12,767
An emotion diary?

509
00:30:12,767 --> 00:30:14,567
Yes.

510
00:30:15,530 --> 00:30:18,933
If it has past feelings written on it.

511
00:30:19,867 --> 00:30:23,133
What if my brother sees it first?

512
00:30:23,133 --> 00:30:25,867
Maybe the lost memories could naturally come back?

513
00:30:25,867 --> 00:30:30,433
Yes, can you try to find it?

514
00:30:30,433 --> 00:30:33,500
Okay, I got it.

515
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:35,833
I'll search through the entire house to find it.

516
00:30:35,833 --> 00:30:37,900
Okay.

517
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:40,833
Is it time for exercise again?

518
00:30:40,833 --> 00:30:43,300
No, it's mealtime.

519
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:44,833
Have you eaten? Would you like to have a meal together…

520
00:30:44,833 --> 00:30:47,133
Ah, I have to go.

521
00:30:47,133 --> 00:30:49,300
Please contact me if you find it.

522
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:51,567
- Okay. 
 - I'll go.

523
00:30:57,900 --> 00:31:02,300
Since we're collaborating, we'll naturally find time to meet.

524
00:31:02,967 --> 00:31:06,967
If I sign with Brother's agency, we could see each other more often.

525
00:31:09,367 --> 00:31:11,000
Please give me one of set number 1.

526
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,167
Yes.

527
00:31:12,167 --> 00:31:14,867
Oh, that… Please give me one of set number 2 as well.

528
00:31:14,867 --> 00:31:16,500
Yes.

529
00:31:31,733 --> 00:31:34,667
I'm going to have lunch.

530
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:41,100
Excuse me? Anyone in there?

531
00:31:51,267 --> 00:31:54,567
 I'm sorry. Because it is a hotel, we cannot show you the CCTV footage 

532
00:31:54,567 --> 00:31:56,433
 due to the nature of the location 

533
00:31:56,433 --> 00:31:59,600
 and the privacy of the person being exposed. 

534
00:32:02,567 --> 00:32:04,067
   

535
00:32:07,467 --> 00:32:08,300
   

536
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:12,467
 You slept at home all day and fell down the stairs half asleep. 

537
00:32:12,467 --> 00:32:14,800
Which one could be correct?

538
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,867
The memory of Lee Shin.

539
00:32:16,867 --> 00:32:20,400
Or my afterimage-like memory.

540
00:32:47,950 --> 00:32:49,670
   
   ­  

541
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:10,060
Are you all right?

542
00:33:10,667 --> 00:33:12,300
Yes.

543
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:15,667
By the way, how long has this tree been here?

544
00:33:15,667 --> 00:33:19,067
It's an event tree that has been here since our hotel was first built.

545
00:33:19,067 --> 00:33:21,100
It is used as a tree for Christmas.

546
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:22,867
And on days with events or weddings,

547
00:33:22,867 --> 00:33:25,900
it's also used as a guestbook tree.

548
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:30,067
Yes, I understand.

549
00:33:44,767 --> 00:33:47,400
Why does my wrist…

550
00:33:58,467 --> 00:34:00,567
On the emergency transport certificate,

551
00:34:00,567 --> 00:34:03,033
there's no record under the name of Lee Kun.

552
00:34:03,033 --> 00:34:05,833
If you're certain about the date and the neighborhood,

553
00:34:05,833 --> 00:34:09,367
there're no records of a patient who fell down the stairs.

554
00:34:10,233 --> 00:34:12,867
So there were no patients transported from J Hotel?

555
00:34:12,867 --> 00:34:16,733
If the patient had lost consciousness and was in critical condition,

556
00:34:16,733 --> 00:34:20,480
the name of the guardian may be written down when the patient is transported.

557
00:34:20,967 --> 00:34:24,800
Then, what about "Lee Seok Du"?

558
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:32,133
"Eun Ji Sun" or "Lee Shin"?

559
00:34:32,133 --> 00:34:34,900
Lee Shin.

560
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:36,733
Oh? It's here.

561
00:34:36,733 --> 00:34:40,367
The record matches the transport to Hanseom Hospital.

562
00:34:40,367 --> 00:34:43,933
Where is the place of the accident? A house?

563
00:34:43,933 --> 00:34:48,000
Or could it be a hotel?

564
00:35:06,033 --> 00:35:10,400
 It says a drowning man was rescued and transported from the southern Han River Bridge. 

565
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:13,433
   

566
00:35:16,567 --> 00:35:18,200
 Drowning… 

567
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:20,900
 What happened that night? 

568
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:22,000
 You fell down the stairs. 

569
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,667
 You slept at home all day and fell down the stairs half asleep. 

570
00:35:25,667 --> 00:35:28,000
 We found you relatively quickly after the accident 

571
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,033
 because the whole family was here. 

572
00:35:31,033 --> 00:35:32,867
 But, why are you asking that? 

573
00:35:32,867 --> 00:35:35,700
 One thing for sure is that my family's testimonies are lies. 

574
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:39,267
 Why? Why is that? 

575
00:35:39,267 --> 00:35:41,867
 Why are they lying? 

576
00:36:04,367 --> 00:36:06,400
What is this memory?

577
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:08,767
Who was that person?

578
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:19,467
 You will be able to know more accurately if you receive a certificate confirming 

579
00:36:19,467 --> 00:36:22,300
 the facts of the incident from the police officer in charge. 

580
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:38,850
Hello?

581
00:36:39,467 --> 00:36:41,270
Yes, that's me.

582
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:44,067
Who is this?

583
00:36:46,267 --> 00:36:48,800
 The call isn't connecting… 

584
00:36:53,028 --> 00:36:54,756
   

585
00:36:58,133 --> 00:36:59,967
Yes.

586
00:37:01,033 --> 00:37:02,300
What?

587
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:04,833
He is going around investigating the accident?

588
00:37:04,833 --> 00:37:08,133
I'm on my way to the police station, but he is not answering my call.

589
00:37:08,133 --> 00:37:10,433
 Can you call my brother for me? 

590
00:37:10,433 --> 00:37:13,133
- I see. 
  - Yes. 

591
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:24,900
 - The customer is currently busy… 
 - Why isn't he answering? 

592
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:27,833
Please pick up.

593
00:37:27,833 --> 00:37:30,267
   

594
00:37:35,567 --> 00:37:38,633
 The customer is currently busy… 

595
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:55,933
It seems like it's all settled now.

596
00:37:55,933 --> 00:38:00,133
You can go in now. It'll take about two weeks.

597
00:38:00,133 --> 00:38:03,467
Then, you can go, and make sure to be contactable.

598
00:38:03,467 --> 00:38:05,900
- Please take care of it. 
 - Yes.

599
00:38:07,467 --> 00:38:09,700
Oh my.

600
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:12,933
The busy Player Lee Shin has come in person.

601
00:38:12,933 --> 00:38:14,300
What about my brother?

602
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:15,567
Did you give the documents to my brother?

603
00:38:15,567 --> 00:38:17,433
No.

604
00:38:17,433 --> 00:38:19,800
Your brother said he had an urgent matter.

605
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:22,367
   

606
00:38:22,367 --> 00:38:24,100
However,

607
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:26,433
even if it's amnesia,

608
00:38:26,433 --> 00:38:29,133
we can't just cover up the incident like this to the person involved.

609
00:38:29,133 --> 00:38:30,967
I'm the family member, and I'll take full responsibility.

610
00:38:30,967 --> 00:38:33,733
If necessary, I'll submit a doctor's opinion.

611
00:38:33,733 --> 00:38:35,833
Is there any reason to remind him of the memory

612
00:38:35,833 --> 00:38:38,667
of jumping into the Han River?

613
00:38:40,067 --> 00:38:42,733
You have such good brotherly love.

614
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,767
The witness is a family member.

615
00:38:50,467 --> 00:38:53,900
Ah, did I believe this too straightforwardly?

616
00:38:54,833 --> 00:38:56,800
- Officer Kim. 
 - Yes.

617
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:59,133
Was that CCTV record from that day

618
00:38:59,133 --> 00:39:01,667
erased or not recorded?

619
00:39:01,667 --> 00:39:04,300
Ah, it rained that day. Right?

620
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:06,933
So it might have been a short circuit.

621
00:39:06,933 --> 00:39:08,667
I don't know.

622
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:15,333
I'm getting a bad feeling.

623
00:39:26,867 --> 00:39:28,833
 Emotion diary. 

624
00:39:28,833 --> 00:39:31,667
 Everything about me will be written there. 

625
00:39:31,667 --> 00:39:34,100
 All his feelings about me. 

626
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:35,533
 No, it can't be. 

627
00:39:35,533 --> 00:39:38,533
 My brother, Ju Yeon, the police, too. 

628
00:39:38,533 --> 00:39:41,133
 I need to find it first. 

629
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:22,667
 Player Si On is helping, so we're together now. 

630
00:40:24,433 --> 00:40:26,667
The meat is burning.

631
00:40:26,667 --> 00:40:29,100
 Oh, thank goodness! As expected, we have a fantastic teamwork. 

632
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:33,200
 That's a relief, and things went well with the police officer. Right? 

633
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:36,267
 For now, it's been well managed. 

634
00:40:36,267 --> 00:40:38,767
 Thankfully, we must also find the emotion diary… 

635
00:40:38,767 --> 00:40:40,300
What terrible manners.

636
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:43,367
Isn't this a company dinner?

637
00:40:43,367 --> 00:40:45,900
A company dinner is also clearly an extension of work.

638
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:48,567
If it's an extension of work, we can order more meat. Right?

639
00:40:48,567 --> 00:40:50,467
We'll order three more servings here, please.

640
00:40:50,467 --> 00:40:51,667
Please give us dessert as well.

641
00:40:51,667 --> 00:40:54,167
- Cold water noodles. 
 - Spicy cold noodles.

642
00:40:54,167 --> 00:40:56,533
See? You guys are a bit off.

643
00:40:56,533 --> 00:40:57,533
Black bean noodles or spicy seafood noodles?

644
00:40:57,533 --> 00:40:58,967
- Spicy seafood noodles. 
 - Black bean noodles.

645
00:40:58,967 --> 00:40:59,967
Chicken leg or chicken breast?

646
00:40:59,967 --> 00:41:01,867
- Chicken leg. 
 - Chicken breast.

647
00:41:02,767 --> 00:41:06,833
See? How can we be so distinctly opposite?

648
00:41:06,833 --> 00:41:09,167
Taste, personality. Nothing matches.

649
00:41:09,167 --> 00:41:12,333
It's all burned.

650
00:41:12,333 --> 00:41:13,967
Player Si On, please eat.

651
00:41:13,967 --> 00:41:17,500
I prefer it less cooked.

652
00:41:19,033 --> 00:41:22,033
Is it really okay for me not to help you?

653
00:41:22,033 --> 00:41:24,500
I carry my own things.

654
00:41:25,133 --> 00:41:27,310
Just them two?

655
00:41:27,310 --> 00:41:28,500
Aigoo.­

656
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:31,767
Those two didn't even know at the time that it was just a lovers' quarrel.

657
00:41:31,767 --> 00:41:33,500
I'm envious of them.

658
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:35,533
Oh my.

659
00:41:35,533 --> 00:41:37,200
What…

660
00:41:37,910 --> 00:41:39,260
Seriously...

661
00:41:39,260 --> 00:41:43,900
If you think you'll get in trouble if you get caught, don't hide it in your belongings.

662
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:46,833
You should hide it in a third party's belongings like this.

663
00:41:46,833 --> 00:41:49,433
This way, you can hide it perfectly.

664
00:41:49,433 --> 00:41:52,467
What is this? Whose clothes are these?

665
00:41:52,467 --> 00:41:54,700
Ugh, the smell.

666
00:41:55,767 --> 00:41:58,500
What's this? Is it yours?

667
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:01,033
Seung Hyun, put this there.

668
00:42:01,933 --> 00:42:03,233
Good.

669
00:42:03,233 --> 00:42:06,600
Looks exactly like it did before.

670
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:09,467
Seung Hyun, I need to put this back up.

671
00:42:09,467 --> 00:42:11,200
Grab onto it there.

672
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:13,967
It may look a bit strange to other people.

673
00:42:13,967 --> 00:42:15,767
Why do you care what other people think?

674
00:42:15,767 --> 00:42:17,567
Shouldn't it be enough that you know what you're doing?

675
00:42:17,567 --> 00:42:21,233
I also dislike being misunderstood for no reason.

676
00:42:21,233 --> 00:42:23,700
Are you telling me not to help with this because you're afraid of being misunderstood?

677
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:26,067
I feel comfortable doing my own things.

678
00:42:26,067 --> 00:42:28,133
Please stop putting that over there.

679
00:42:28,133 --> 00:42:30,533
Don't pull it.

680
00:42:31,833 --> 00:42:36,200
This is my style, and I'll handle my work myself.

681
00:42:44,867 --> 00:42:46,700
You might get hurt doing that.

682
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:49,967
I can do it alone.

683
00:42:49,967 --> 00:42:52,500
- Oh my. 
 - Oh, dear.

684
00:42:54,733 --> 00:42:56,767
Oh my.

685
00:43:04,633 --> 00:43:06,967
Oh my.

686
00:43:06,967 --> 00:43:09,467
Someone will get hurt if you keep doing this.

687
00:43:09,467 --> 00:43:12,067
Now…

688
00:43:16,233 --> 00:43:18,567
Oh my, I was surprised.

689
00:43:18,567 --> 00:43:22,733
It's best to sort things out clearly.

690
00:43:22,733 --> 00:43:26,833
Both the room and the mind.

691
00:43:32,867 --> 00:43:35,733
I'm not sure if it's too late to go to his place.

692
00:43:35,733 --> 00:43:37,467
Just deliver the side dishes.

693
00:43:37,467 --> 00:43:40,733
We should take care of him.

694
00:43:41,467 --> 00:43:44,233
It's not Shin's first time going to the athletes' village.

695
00:43:44,233 --> 00:43:46,967
Let's skip it this year.

696
00:43:46,967 --> 00:43:50,600
What are you talking about? I've already booked the hotel next to the athletes' village.

697
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:53,500
I have been taking care of Shin ever since he was young.

698
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:54,767
The same goes for Cola.

699
00:43:54,767 --> 00:43:58,167
We didn't tell it to Kun, but it was meant to be a therapy dog.

700
00:43:58,167 --> 00:44:01,333
But whenever the two meet, they start growling at each other.

701
00:44:01,900 --> 00:44:03,333
Then, what about Shin?

702
00:44:03,333 --> 00:44:07,033
Yes, I've sent a text. I told him to go over after the workout.

703
00:44:08,233 --> 00:44:10,267
Let's go, yeah.

704
00:44:18,067 --> 00:44:20,033
Ah, right.

705
00:44:27,767 --> 00:44:29,867
- What is it? 
 - My parents are here.

706
00:44:29,867 --> 00:44:33,200
What? What? Oh!

707
00:44:34,830 --> 00:44:36,633
Just a moment.

708
00:44:38,967 --> 00:44:41,533
Why are you going that way?

709
00:44:41,533 --> 00:44:43,970
Ah, gosh.

710
00:44:43,970 --> 00:44:45,967
I'm working right now, so maybe next time…

711
00:44:45,967 --> 00:44:47,933
What next time? We're also busy.

712
00:44:47,933 --> 00:44:50,300
- I brought some side dishes. 
 - Why did you bring this dog?

713
00:44:50,300 --> 00:44:52,500
Your mom did. I have no idea.

714
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:55,233
- Give it to me. 
 - No, it's fine. Let go, let go.

715
00:44:58,300 --> 00:45:00,567
Ugh, it's heavy.

716
00:45:00,567 --> 00:45:03,333
Kun, put all of this in the fridge.

717
00:45:03,333 --> 00:45:05,300
- Yes, please give it to me. 
 - My arm hurts.

718
00:45:06,833 --> 00:45:08,067
Ugh, it's hot.

719
00:45:08,067 --> 00:45:09,400
Why is it so hot?

720
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:12,267
Ah, Mom, why?

721
00:45:12,267 --> 00:45:14,467
No, I was going to open the door because it's hot.

722
00:45:14,467 --> 00:45:15,900
Ah, I'll open it.

723
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:20,167
If it gets hot and then suddenly gets cold, you might catch a cold.

724
00:45:21,667 --> 00:45:23,367
Why are you suddenly so worried about me?

725
00:45:23,367 --> 00:45:24,500
It's natural for a son to worry about his mom.

726
00:45:24,500 --> 00:45:26,800
What should I do?

727
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:29,467
Hey, Kun, bring me some water.

728
00:45:29,467 --> 00:45:30,933
Ah, I don't know, I don't know.

729
00:45:30,933 --> 00:45:33,867
- Why are you drinking water? We'll eat right away. 
 - Don't go, don't go.

730
00:45:33,867 --> 00:45:36,333
Ah, this is driving me crazy.

731
00:45:36,333 --> 00:45:40,567
Shall we go out to eat? There's a delicious hangover soup place that opened nearby.

732
00:45:40,567 --> 00:45:43,667
I've been boiling beef bone soup all night.

733
00:45:43,667 --> 00:45:45,933
Ah, beef bone soup.

734
00:45:45,933 --> 00:45:50,567
Kun, that lady…

735
00:45:52,567 --> 00:45:55,933
Dr. Kyeong Ju Yeon, your first love.

736
00:45:55,933 --> 00:45:57,733
Ah, yes.

737
00:45:57,733 --> 00:46:00,367
When shall we have a meal together?

738
00:46:00,367 --> 00:46:02,433
- A meal? 
 - Yes.

739
00:46:02,433 --> 00:46:07,300
If you keep making opportunities, a woman's heart might come back around.

740
00:46:09,167 --> 00:46:11,333
It's not like that.

741
00:46:11,333 --> 00:46:13,133
Did you really get turned down?

742
00:46:13,133 --> 00:46:15,900
Did you completely give up on that lady?

743
00:46:15,900 --> 00:46:17,467
Yes, well…

744
00:46:17,467 --> 00:46:21,633
I was just glad to see an old first love that's old.

745
00:46:21,633 --> 00:46:24,200
There's no reason or possibility of anything going well.

746
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:27,333
No feelings either.

747
00:46:30,300 --> 00:46:35,367
It's a shame, she was really nice.

748
00:46:36,967 --> 00:46:40,933
Go, go, I said go, this isn't the place. Go now.

749
00:46:40,933 --> 00:46:42,100
- Please! 
  - Oh my, Cola! 

750
00:46:42,100 --> 00:46:44,767
Oh my, Cola is going out.

751
00:46:44,767 --> 00:46:46,633
Hey, Cola! Cola!

752
00:46:46,633 --> 00:46:50,400
Ah, you want to go to the bathroom, don't you?

753
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:53,100
Cola peed all over in the car.

754
00:46:53,100 --> 00:46:55,667
But what's going on? You are holding Cola like that?

755
00:46:55,667 --> 00:46:58,733
No, this much is nothing.

756
00:46:58,733 --> 00:47:00,067
Oh, really.

757
00:47:00,067 --> 00:47:04,167
Why did you put a door lock on that room?

758
00:47:04,167 --> 00:47:07,500
Mom, mom, mom! Why are you going in there?

759
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:09,167
Okay.

760
00:47:09,167 --> 00:47:10,867
 Oh my, what is this? 

761
00:47:10,867 --> 00:47:12,400
 Oh my, seriously. 

762
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:13,733
 Don't do it. 

763
00:47:13,733 --> 00:47:16,833
 Ugh, the smell. 

764
00:47:16,833 --> 00:47:19,867
Kun, I asked you to bring some water.

765
00:47:22,267 --> 00:47:23,300
What is it?

766
00:47:23,300 --> 00:47:27,033
 After eating, I made soup… 

767
00:47:27,033 --> 00:47:28,967
Why is it so hot inside the house?

768
00:47:28,967 --> 00:47:32,267
 All of us should eat here before you go. 

769
00:47:32,267 --> 00:47:35,600
 Yes, let's have some beef bone soup. Okay? 

770
00:47:38,430 --> 00:47:41,133
Oh my! Why doesn't this open? Kun, try opening this.

771
00:47:41,133 --> 00:47:43,467
You're also a woman.

772
00:47:43,467 --> 00:47:46,233
Honey, why isn't this working?

773
00:47:46,233 --> 00:47:48,800
You two can't open that one thing?

774
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:50,700
Is it not opening due to pressure? Hold on. Be careful, it's hot.

775
00:47:50,700 --> 00:47:52,067
- It won't open? 
 - Let go, let go.

776
00:47:52,067 --> 00:47:53,667
- Here, try holding it. 
 - Dad, oh my.

777
00:47:53,667 --> 00:47:54,700
Be careful. It's hot.

778
00:47:54,700 --> 00:47:57,300
How did you lock this?

779
00:47:57,300 --> 00:48:00,100
Careful, I said it's hot.

780
00:48:00,100 --> 00:48:02,000
Oh no, what should we do?

781
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,133
Quickly, open the door!

782
00:48:03,133 --> 00:48:05,067
Oh, it's hot, hot!

783
00:48:05,067 --> 00:48:06,200
Hurry up and take off your pants.

784
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:07,600
No, no.

785
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:10,033
- No, you have to take it off. 
 - No, not here.

786
00:48:10,033 --> 00:48:13,133
Dad, I'll go to the tub to change clothes.

787
00:48:13,133 --> 00:48:15,733
Quickly, to the bathtub, bathtub!

788
00:48:15,733 --> 00:48:19,533
Kun, I told you to take off your pants quickly.

789
00:48:21,900 --> 00:48:23,767
This way! This way!

790
00:48:23,767 --> 00:48:26,067
- Hey, Kun! 
 - Kun!

791
00:48:26,067 --> 00:48:28,567
Soju! Soju!

792
00:48:28,567 --> 00:48:31,100
Got it, soju?

793
00:48:36,267 --> 00:48:39,300
 - Hurry up! 
 - I'll do it in the bathtub. Mom! Dad! 

794
00:48:40,733 --> 00:48:42,867
Shoes, shoes.

795
00:48:45,833 --> 00:48:47,800
Do you want me to help you? Where are you?

796
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:52,567
What? Did he go outside? Shouldn't we call 911?

797
00:48:55,167 --> 00:48:58,533
Ah, it's tough. What a surprise.

798
00:49:00,367 --> 00:49:02,967
Room 2001?

799
00:49:02,967 --> 00:49:05,467
No, it's not.

800
00:49:17,833 --> 00:49:20,733
The training starts tomorrow. What's going on? The coach isn't even here.

801
00:49:20,733 --> 00:49:25,033
I have to say I'm going to the court, so my mom doesn't scold me.

802
00:49:26,333 --> 00:49:28,900
What are you watching? Something interesting?

803
00:49:28,900 --> 00:49:30,867
I'm watching your games.

804
00:49:30,867 --> 00:49:33,833
Ah, really.

805
00:49:33,833 --> 00:49:36,767
Your mom said you should sign a contract with your brother's agency.

806
00:49:36,767 --> 00:49:38,967
Did my mom tell you to say that to me?

807
00:49:38,967 --> 00:49:42,467
No, I saw your text earlier.

808
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:47,533
Why are you reading someone else's text?

809
00:49:47,533 --> 00:49:49,500
I told you nicely, but why are you being rude?

810
00:49:49,500 --> 00:49:51,100
Rude?

811
00:49:51,100 --> 00:49:53,533
Is there something I shouldn't look at?

812
00:49:53,533 --> 00:49:56,167
There is a saying that goes, "The thief is frightened even by a squirrel."

813
00:49:56,167 --> 00:50:00,167
It's a mouse. Not squirrel.

814
00:50:00,167 --> 00:50:03,000
Never mind, forget it.

815
00:50:05,700 --> 00:50:07,667
You clean it up.

816
00:50:13,167 --> 00:50:15,500
   

817
00:50:15,500 --> 00:50:18,267
The CEO and I are the worst match.

818
00:50:18,267 --> 00:50:22,900
Wait, then how about him and the team doctor?

819
00:50:22,900 --> 00:50:25,833
What? A perfect match?

820
00:50:25,833 --> 00:50:28,400
Oh, really.

821
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:50,267
I'm too late. Mom is here. Right?

822
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:58,267
Ah, because I had to leave in a rush.

823
00:50:59,667 --> 00:51:02,633
I'm sorry for lying for no reason.

824
00:51:02,633 --> 00:51:05,267
Oh, no, no, it's okay.

825
00:51:05,267 --> 00:51:09,433
One lie leads to another, you know.

826
00:51:15,133 --> 00:51:17,333
Just wait, I have shoes in the car.

827
00:51:17,333 --> 00:51:19,633
No, it's okay. It's…

828
00:51:19,633 --> 00:51:22,333
It's all right.

829
00:51:27,030 --> 00:51:31,260
♫  Being together with the worries  ♫

830
00:51:31,260 --> 00:51:35,160
♫  that cling to me  ♫

831
00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:39,867
♫  Makes the dark night even darker ♫

832
00:51:39,867 --> 00:51:42,633
- Try putting your feet in here. 
 - Oh, it's okay. I'll do it myself.

833
00:51:42,633 --> 00:51:45,433
I can do at least this much for you.

834
00:51:49,300 --> 00:51:52,200
If you haven't committed a crime, why did you run out barefoot?

835
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:55,600
Staying up all night with me is not a big sin.

836
00:51:55,600 --> 00:51:58,100
I don't want to be misunderstood for no reason.

837
00:51:58,100 --> 00:52:01,567
Okay, so put them on now.

838
00:52:11,100 --> 00:52:13,767
Thank you for the shoes and the blanket.

839
00:52:13,767 --> 00:52:17,367
I'm feeling a bit chilled, so I will go in first.

840
00:52:22,100 --> 00:52:24,833
If you're going to bring them anyway, bring my own shoes.

841
00:52:24,833 --> 00:52:27,467
What are these? They're too big.

842
00:52:28,067 --> 00:52:29,833
Oh my, you startled me.

843
00:52:29,833 --> 00:52:31,400
What are you doing?

844
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:33,733
If you're going to grumble, speak quietly.

845
00:52:33,733 --> 00:52:36,100
Oh my.

846
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:40,467
Put me down now. What are you doing?

847
00:52:41,900 --> 00:52:45,160
♫  If only we could be peaceful  ♫

848
00:52:45,167 --> 00:52:47,600
Aren't you coming in?

849
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:52,033
Well, I came here to see our parents.

850
00:52:52,033 --> 00:52:56,200
They're gone, right? I need to go home.

851
00:52:57,767 --> 00:53:01,333
Thanks for the shoes.

852
00:53:01,333 --> 00:53:03,433
Why are you thanking me?

853
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:07,100
Then let's say I'm not grateful.

854
00:53:07,100 --> 00:53:09,433
See you next time.

855
00:53:10,467 --> 00:53:13,433
Put me down, please. I'll walk on my own feet. Okay?

856
00:53:13,433 --> 00:53:16,567
I'll carry you and walk you there.

857
00:53:16,567 --> 00:53:18,533
I said I will walk on my own feet.

858
00:53:18,533 --> 00:53:21,400
- I'll put you down. 
 - Oh dear.

859
00:53:21,400 --> 00:53:23,500
- You want me to put you down? 
 - Don't do it, please.

860
00:53:23,500 --> 00:53:26,133
Let's go comfortably.

861
00:53:32,833 --> 00:53:35,100
- Safety! 
 - Safety!

862
00:53:35,100 --> 00:53:38,867
- Oh my, you're light. 
 - I'm doomed.

863
00:53:40,833 --> 00:53:43,867
They're really deeply in love.

864
00:53:43,867 --> 00:53:46,400
Oh, I'm envious of them.

865
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:50,267
   

866
00:53:51,133 --> 00:53:52,733
   

867
00:53:52,733 --> 00:53:55,367
What reason would there be to see more?

868
00:53:55,367 --> 00:53:59,300
I've increased the royalty rates and the signing bonus in favor of you.

869
00:53:59,300 --> 00:54:01,433
Shall we sign the contract quickly and go for dinner?

870
00:54:01,433 --> 00:54:03,367
How about Japanese food?

871
00:54:04,500 --> 00:54:05,800
Right, right, right.

872
00:54:05,800 --> 00:54:07,833
Our Shin likes meat. Right?

873
00:54:07,833 --> 00:54:11,233
Shall we go eat Korean beef? Korean beef omakase?

874
00:54:17,733 --> 00:54:19,567
Hey.

875
00:54:19,567 --> 00:54:21,400
You… What are you doing?

876
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:24,367
I should go to where that woman is.

877
00:54:24,367 --> 00:54:26,967
What do you mean a woman? Where are you planning to go?

878
00:54:26,967 --> 00:54:29,267
My brother's agency.

879
00:54:29,267 --> 00:54:31,033
I'm sorry, but I can't sign the contract.

880
00:54:31,033 --> 00:54:35,033
Hey, Lee Shin! Hey, Shin!

881
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,467
Oh, man!

882
00:54:58,300 --> 00:55:00,633
Hey, Lee Shin!

883
00:55:17,800 --> 00:55:20,333
   

884
00:55:23,133 --> 00:55:25,700
   

885
00:55:26,467 --> 00:55:28,667
Why isn't he answering the phone!

886
00:55:29,333 --> 00:55:31,633
I've got you!

887
00:56:01,590 --> 00:56:11,690


888
00:56:13,300 --> 00:56:15,533
 How dare you think you can do whatever you want? 

889
00:56:15,533 --> 00:56:18,833
You have to make a contract with me. You have no choice.

890
00:56:18,833 --> 00:56:21,133
Why?

891
00:56:21,633 --> 00:56:24,367
Do you have some kind of leverage on me?

892
00:56:25,767 --> 00:56:28,533
Being blackmailed with scandalous photos?

893
00:56:28,533 --> 00:56:30,167
Publish the article.

894
00:56:30,167 --> 00:56:32,400
It has nothing to do with me.

895
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:36,900
I have nothing to do with that woman, and besides, there's someone else I like.

896
00:56:36,900 --> 00:56:39,567
You think you can make a deal with that?

897
00:56:39,567 --> 00:56:40,900
What about this?

898
00:56:40,900 --> 00:56:43,100
The truth about your brother's accident.

899
00:56:43,100 --> 00:56:45,767
Does that pique your interest?

900
00:56:46,967 --> 00:56:48,633
I thought there was something more special.

901
00:56:48,633 --> 00:56:53,300
My brother has already come to know about the accident.

902
00:56:53,300 --> 00:56:56,800
Are you trying to catch me over something so trivial?

903
00:56:56,800 --> 00:57:00,533
You have to work harder. That won't work.

904
00:57:00,533 --> 00:57:02,367
Wait a minute.

905
00:57:03,233 --> 00:57:05,867
Your brother already knows?

906
00:57:05,867 --> 00:57:08,200
About falling into the river?

907
00:57:09,267 --> 00:57:13,600
Let's sit down first and talk. I'll explain everything.

908
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:15,300
Why?

909
00:57:17,080 --> 00:57:18,880
Do you—

910
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,533
Did you know everything?

911
00:57:32,100 --> 00:57:33,100
Are you okay?

912
00:57:33,100 --> 00:57:37,233
I can just tell the truth and get treated.

913
00:57:37,233 --> 00:57:39,567
You can't do that.

914
00:57:43,100 --> 00:57:45,133
What about this?

915
00:57:48,310 --> 00:57:50,680
 ­  

916
00:57:57,350 --> 00:57:59,800
  ­ 

917
00:57:59,800 --> 00:58:02,200
Mr. Lee Kun, are you okay?

918
00:58:04,533 --> 00:58:07,233
You bastard.

919
00:58:10,033 --> 00:58:12,833
There was no CCTV, which is strange.

920
00:58:12,833 --> 00:58:14,933
I wondered why.

921
00:58:14,933 --> 00:58:17,400
It broke because it rained?

922
00:58:19,433 --> 00:58:23,333
But you're right there in the picture.

923
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:28,933
You're the only witness, and your brother can't even remember.

924
00:58:28,933 --> 00:58:33,267
Did you think you were the only one who knew the truth about that day?

925
00:58:33,267 --> 00:58:36,867
Even after saving your brother's life? Why is that?

926
00:58:36,867 --> 00:58:39,900
Why would you try to hide it so much?

927
00:58:42,067 --> 00:58:44,600
Now I know why you

928
00:58:44,600 --> 00:58:48,267
tried to cover up your brother's accident.

929
00:58:51,767 --> 00:58:54,267
Take a good look.

930
00:58:54,933 --> 00:58:56,767
What do you think?

931
00:58:56,767 --> 00:58:58,667
It's clear, right?

932
00:59:01,900 --> 00:59:03,767
Why?

933
00:59:03,767 --> 00:59:08,200
Do you now remember what happened that day?

934
00:59:16,767 --> 00:59:20,867
Can you hear me? Mr. Lee Kun! Mr. Lee Kun!

935
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,833
That day, you pushed...

936
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:32,633
your brother.

937
00:59:36,100 --> 00:59:39,770
♫  Drowning  ♫

938
00:59:39,770 --> 00:59:45,460
♫  Drowning in an ocean of grey  ♫

939
00:59:47,567 --> 00:59:51,200
♫  Running  ♫

940
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:56,633
♫  Running backwards to you  ♫

941
00:59:58,990 --> 01:00:00,730
♫  Drowning, drowning  ♫

942
01:00:00,733 --> 01:00:05,733
   

943
01:00:05,733 --> 01:00:07,600
 I feel like everything is my fault. 

944
01:00:07,600 --> 01:00:09,333
 Both the pain and the side effects. 

945
01:00:09,333 --> 01:00:11,900
 Are you hiding anything from Shin and me? 

946
01:00:11,900 --> 01:00:13,400
 Are you sure there is nothing? 

947
01:00:13,400 --> 01:00:14,533
 Why are you coming out from there? 

948
01:00:14,533 --> 01:00:16,000
 I got a job here as an interpreter. 

949
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:17,000
 Quit right now. 

950
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:17,767
 What if I don't want to? 

951
01:00:17,767 --> 01:00:19,933
 If you haven't eaten, let's eat together at least. 

952
01:00:19,933 --> 01:00:22,033
 I'm sorry, but today I… 

953
01:00:22,033 --> 01:00:23,900
 I missed her for a very long time, 

954
01:00:23,900 --> 01:00:26,233
 and we were finally reunited, but the result was as you know… 

955
01:00:26,233 --> 01:00:28,567
 If I had been your first love, I wouldn't have hurt you like that. 

956
01:00:28,567 --> 01:00:29,567
 Do you like my brother? 

957
01:00:29,567 --> 01:00:32,400
 Your eyes sparkle whenever we talk about my brother. 

958
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:35,300
 It can't be. It shouldn't be. 

959
01:00:35,300 --> 01:00:39,400
 Because I'm not his real first love.
