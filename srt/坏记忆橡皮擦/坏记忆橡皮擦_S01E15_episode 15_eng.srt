1
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:08,260
 ­  

2
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:14,290
 ­  

3
00:00:16,270 --> 00:00:18,140
   

4
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:23,080
   

5
00:00:25,433 --> 00:00:33,400
   

6
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:39,367
   

7
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:43,833
 No, no! 

8
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:55,060


9
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,867
 Whatever you do, you are caught in self-pity and feelings of inferiority 

10
00:01:02,867 --> 00:01:06,200
 since you'll never be able to escape from your past memories 

11
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:08,667
 until you die. 

12
00:01:08,667 --> 00:01:09,933
 Hey, are you out of your mind? 

13
00:01:09,933 --> 00:01:12,267
 Why are you talking about injuries to her? 

14
00:01:12,267 --> 00:01:13,800
 Just do your own job well. 

15
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:17,267
 And yet you live off your younger brother shamelessly. 

16
00:01:17,267 --> 00:01:19,967
 Mom! 

17
00:01:22,833 --> 00:01:26,300
 Mom, take me too! 

18
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:28,767
 No. 

19
00:01:31,767 --> 00:01:33,600
 Kun! 

20
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,400
 Kun! 

21
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,733
 Kun, are you okay? 

22
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:46,967
   

23
00:02:39,367 --> 00:02:41,133
This, here.

24
00:02:41,133 --> 00:02:43,533
Thank you.

25
00:02:48,367 --> 00:02:51,633
I heard about it from Shin

26
00:02:51,633 --> 00:02:56,700
that you tried to protect Kun till the end.

27
00:02:58,367 --> 00:03:00,833
But I ultimately couldn't protect him.

28
00:03:00,833 --> 00:03:03,300
It's not your fault.

29
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:06,167
Before coming here,

30
00:03:06,167 --> 00:03:10,700
I stopped by the police station and saw the accident video.

31
00:03:12,367 --> 00:03:15,600
You heard it from Shin, right?

32
00:03:16,767 --> 00:03:21,533
That my two sons are living such unhappy lives.

33
00:03:21,533 --> 00:03:24,233
I had no idea.

34
00:03:24,233 --> 00:03:27,567
It's my fault for not taking care of my sons.

35
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:31,700
My son, Kun,

36
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:33,800
can he get better?

37
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,767
The fact that we are by his side.

38
00:03:35,767 --> 00:03:38,800
I'm not sure if that will be of help.

39
00:03:39,833 --> 00:03:41,600
He needs

40
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:45,000
his family's support more than anyone else.

41
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,067
The origin of his trauma was a wrist injury, but

42
00:03:48,067 --> 00:03:54,433
the trauma from being hurt and abandoned by his family was the most severe.

43
00:03:54,433 --> 00:03:59,267
He had no family to lean on when times were the hardest.

44
00:04:00,233 --> 00:04:05,733
All he has with us are bad memories, but how…

45
00:04:05,733 --> 00:04:10,633
You can fill his bad memories about family with good ones.

46
00:04:10,633 --> 00:04:16,200
Will that make the memories of the past disappear?

47
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:19,567
They won't disappear.

48
00:04:19,567 --> 00:04:20,967
However,

49
00:04:20,967 --> 00:04:25,700
the goal is to increase the importance of current memories over past ones.

50
00:04:31,267 --> 00:04:34,500
Every day, you lock yourself in that gloomy room, drinking away.

51
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:37,500
Do you know that our family is suffocating because of you?

52
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,500
What kind of way is that to talk to your brother?

53
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,867
What have you done so well?

54
00:04:41,867 --> 00:04:43,300
You're both the same.

55
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:45,067
Ah, Mom, he's…

56
00:04:45,067 --> 00:04:46,633
Oh my.

57
00:04:46,633 --> 00:04:51,100
I can't believe this is why I gave birth

58
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:53,200
to you guys 27, 28 years ago.

59
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:55,100
Why do you talk like that again?

60
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:57,233
I'm sorry.

61
00:04:57,233 --> 00:05:00,100
I shouldn't have been born.

62
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:03,000
If I weren't here, everyone would have been relieved.

63
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,400
I should just disappear.

64
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:08,300
If I don't want to see this state of affairs, I should leave home.

65
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:10,000
No, I'll leave.

66
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,433
Everyone, come here and sit down.

67
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:31,600
What are you doing right now?

68
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:35,400
Why are you making a fuss, taking down all the trophies and photos?

69
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:39,033
Come here, and sit down now!

70
00:05:41,333 --> 00:05:43,000
Come.

71
00:05:50,533 --> 00:05:52,600
Up until now,

72
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,567
for the peace of the family,

73
00:05:54,567 --> 00:05:58,467
I've been watching over, stepping down from being the head of the household,

74
00:05:58,467 --> 00:06:00,233
but it can't be like this anymore.

75
00:06:00,233 --> 00:06:02,100
Starting today,

76
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:07,033
anyone who disturbs the peace of our home will not be forgiven.

77
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:08,833
Your dad is right.

78
00:06:08,833 --> 00:06:11,333
Grown-ups are still fighting each other.

79
00:06:11,333 --> 00:06:15,560
The head of the family is talking!

80
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:18,700
Starting today, our family will be reborn.

81
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:20,533
In that sense,

82
00:06:20,533 --> 00:06:23,400
let's create good memories as a family,

83
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,967
and take a new family photo.

84
00:06:24,967 --> 00:06:27,033
From today on, there is no past.

85
00:06:27,033 --> 00:06:29,867
There is only the present.

86
00:06:29,867 --> 00:06:32,567
Now, everyone, put this on.

87
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:37,800
   

88
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:40,033
   

89
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:44,600
   

90
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:47,400
   

91
00:07:46,067 --> 00:07:48,133
Two, three.

92
00:07:48,133 --> 00:07:50,700
One more, please. Can you take a picture of our backs?

93
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:53,867
Hey, turn around.

94
00:07:53,867 --> 00:07:56,067
- One, two, three.
- Our backs.

95
00:07:56,067 --> 00:07:59,967
    
 Turn around so your faces show too.

96
00:07:59,967 --> 00:08:01,700
- Kun, look back. 
 - Faces.

97
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:03,600
One, two, three.

98
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:06,100
Hey, it's really nice. Right?

99
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:10,267
It's family's first-ever unity event. It's just so heartwarming.

100
00:08:10,267 --> 00:08:12,867
Even so, a picnic in the dead of winter is a bit…

101
00:08:12,867 --> 00:08:15,400
No, all their birthdays are in winter.

102
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:18,433
We only loved spring.

103
00:08:18,433 --> 00:08:20,500
Let's eat up.

104
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,967
Let's eat up. Come on, eat up.

105
00:08:22,967 --> 00:08:24,100
Wow, that looks delicious.

106
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:27,500
- Well, wow, that looks delicious. 
 - Ah, it's cold.

107
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,933
- Cola. 
 - Hey, don't open it, don't open it.

108
00:08:32,933 --> 00:08:34,133
What's going on?

109
00:08:34,133 --> 00:08:35,933
No dust got in, right? All right, it's fine.

110
00:08:35,933 --> 00:08:38,633
Huh, what's this?

111
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:44,067
Ah, that startled me.

112
00:08:44,933 --> 00:08:47,667
Now, let's eat again.

113
00:08:47,667 --> 00:08:51,433
Oh dear, are you okay?

114
00:08:54,967 --> 00:08:58,467
Let's pull out!

115
00:09:07,133 --> 00:09:09,600
Oh dear.

116
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,267
Do you want to take a taxi?

117
00:09:12,267 --> 00:09:14,567
- Hey. 
 - He's coming.

118
00:09:15,633 --> 00:09:17,333
Surprise!

119
00:09:17,333 --> 00:09:18,567
One, two, three.

120
00:09:18,567 --> 00:09:19,833
- Happy birthday. 
 - Happy birthday to you.

121
00:09:19,833 --> 00:09:21,900
No, again, again! One, two, three.

122
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:24,833
- Happy birthday. 
 - Happy birthday.

123
00:09:24,833 --> 00:09:28,500
Happy birthday.

124
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:32,433
Happy birthday to…

125
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,033
Why is the mood like this?

126
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:46,533
- Hey. 
 - Yes?

127
00:09:46,533 --> 00:09:48,900
You guys just go.

128
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:51,200
- Go? 
 - Do we have to go?

129
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,467
- What should we do about this? 
 - This…

130
00:09:52,467 --> 00:09:54,033
How… Should we clean it up?

131
00:09:54,033 --> 00:09:55,767
- Have some cake. 
 - Oh, cake.

132
00:09:55,767 --> 00:09:57,033
It's delicious.

133
00:09:57,033 --> 00:09:59,033
Leave it behind.

134
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,333
 I'm Kyeong Ju Yeon. 

135
00:10:38,333 --> 00:10:41,667
 The diffuser has a calming effect with its lavender scent. 

136
00:10:41,667 --> 00:10:44,033
 It soothes the mind. 

137
00:10:44,033 --> 00:10:46,600
 Cape jasmine stabilizes the brain, 

138
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:49,600
 and helps with a good night's sleep. 

139
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,533
 Yellow curtains help alleviate a lack of motivation. 

140
00:10:52,533 --> 00:10:56,033
 Blue bedding reduces stress levels. 

141
00:10:56,033 --> 00:11:00,200
 Green rugs relieve physical and mental fatigue and generate positive energy. 

142
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:04,833
 They aid emotional balance and provide mental comfort. 

143
00:11:04,833 --> 00:11:08,633
 I hope it'll be of some help. 

144
00:11:16,467 --> 00:11:18,300
 Also, 

145
00:11:19,867 --> 00:11:21,933
 I'm sorry. 

146
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:49,867
♫  The silent streets are filled  ♫

147
00:13:49,867 --> 00:13:57,333
♫  With countless thoughts and the wounds inside them  ♫

148
00:13:57,333 --> 00:14:04,933
♫  You light a small light  ♫

149
00:14:04,933 --> 00:14:11,800
♫  In a corner of my heart that I had ignored  ♫

150
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:18,300
♫  Even if that unreachable dream  ♫

151
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:26,467
♫  Turns away from me and becomes more blurred  ♫

152
00:14:27,633 --> 00:14:34,000
♫  I will walk towards that day  ♫

153
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:54,900
I miss pretty auntie.

154
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:57,000
   

155
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,433
I can go to Italy and meet her.

156
00:15:29,033 --> 00:15:31,033
Jeez.

157
00:15:31,033 --> 00:15:32,500
Oh my, excuse me.

158
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:35,400
Have you by any chance not seen Sae Yan today?

159
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:38,333
You ask me every time. I said she hasn't come.

160
00:15:38,333 --> 00:15:41,167
If you happen to see our Sae Yan, please be sure to let me know.

161
00:15:41,167 --> 00:15:43,300
All right.

162
00:15:53,533 --> 00:15:55,533
 Come in. 

163
00:16:04,667 --> 00:16:08,667
Are those foreigners looking for Sae Yan?

164
00:16:08,667 --> 00:16:12,200
How can there be absolutely no news like this?

165
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:16,067
It seems she is with her father in Seoul.

166
00:16:16,067 --> 00:16:19,333
I wonder where she's hiding.

167
00:16:19,333 --> 00:16:22,933
I shouldn't have sent her away coldly.

168
00:16:22,933 --> 00:16:29,533
Is she upset with me? And is that why there's no contact?

169
00:16:29,533 --> 00:16:34,867
Should we… really not report it to the police?

170
00:16:34,867 --> 00:16:37,333
No, don't report it to the police.

171
00:16:37,333 --> 00:16:40,433
If the police find him.

172
00:16:40,433 --> 00:16:42,100
Sae Yan will find out, right?

173
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:44,467
She'll find that her father has a criminal record.

174
00:16:44,467 --> 00:16:50,200
I don't want her to know that her father is such a person.

175
00:16:53,767 --> 00:16:57,333
I'm just worried if her father will harm her.

176
00:16:57,333 --> 00:17:00,267
She's his daughter, surely not.

177
00:17:00,267 --> 00:17:02,733
Oh, right.

178
00:17:02,733 --> 00:17:06,133
Should I tell Ju Yeon honestly?

179
00:17:06,133 --> 00:17:08,433
Since they are close, they might contact each other separately.

180
00:17:08,433 --> 00:17:10,667
What about my daughter?

181
00:17:10,667 --> 00:17:13,600
What about the pain my daughter will endure?

182
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:18,900
Do you mean that it's not okay for Sae Yan to be hurt, but it's okay for Ju Yeon?

183
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:21,300
If you're going to say that, don't ever come here again.

184
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:23,067
Ah, that…

185
00:17:23,067 --> 00:17:28,133
It seems like I lost my reason thinking too much about Sae Yan.

186
00:17:28,133 --> 00:17:32,333
Sorry. I'm sorry.

187
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:39,967
Resignation letter?

188
00:17:40,933 --> 00:17:43,100
What do you mean by this?

189
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:46,767
If someone has to resign, it should be me. But why are you quitting?

190
00:17:46,767 --> 00:17:50,233
It was me who persuaded you to cover up the side effects.

191
00:17:50,233 --> 00:17:55,033
Since it all started with my thesis, I should take responsibility.

192
00:17:56,433 --> 00:18:01,400
The one who used the subject was Te Oh, not you, no?

193
00:18:03,767 --> 00:18:05,833
Look.

194
00:18:05,833 --> 00:18:08,467
Unlike mouse number 109,

195
00:18:08,467 --> 00:18:12,600
there's no damage to the brain fuse, and all brain circuits are normal.

196
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:15,833
It's just that everything has returned to the way it was before.

197
00:18:17,667 --> 00:18:20,433
What about the wounds the test subjects received?

198
00:18:20,433 --> 00:18:24,200
What about the shock and pain of feeling betrayed?

199
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,767
Just like he said,

200
00:18:25,767 --> 00:18:28,567
I turned his good memories

201
00:18:28,567 --> 00:18:31,800
of a first love into bad memories.

202
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,000
Also,

203
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,667
I also directly referred myself to the ethics committee for disciplinary review.

204
00:18:37,667 --> 00:18:39,800
Then I'll be the one to take that discipline.

205
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:44,633
I can't block my junior's future just to save myself.

206
00:18:44,633 --> 00:18:47,800
Please promise to stay at the hospital until the end

207
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:51,067
and take responsibility for the subject.

208
00:18:51,067 --> 00:18:54,300
I can't trust Senior Te Oh. Please take care of it.

209
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:56,867
Hey, Kyeong Ju Yeon.

210
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,933
You are really…

211
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:29,067
A contract termination agreement?

212
00:19:29,067 --> 00:19:30,733
Could you wait just a little longer?

213
00:19:30,733 --> 00:19:33,467
He is momentarily anxious, so…

214
00:19:33,467 --> 00:19:35,333
There's no more to say.

215
00:19:35,333 --> 00:19:38,367
Stamp your seal on the contract termination agreement. Don't drag it out.

216
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:40,567
I will continue as Si On's team doctor as well.

217
00:19:40,567 --> 00:19:43,567
I'll act as her manager for a bit too to ensure there's no problem with her rehabilitation.

218
00:19:43,567 --> 00:19:46,867
If you could be understanding about the CEO's vacancy for just a while.

219
00:19:46,867 --> 00:19:49,867
CEO also agreed with it.

220
00:19:50,867 --> 00:19:53,167
Shin's mother.

221
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:14,233
You said I'm your role model, right?

222
00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:19,633
This is my sons' scrapbook.

223
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:23,300
For 20 years,

224
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:27,500
I collected articles about their victories while taking care of them.

225
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:29,767
Oh my, this many?

226
00:20:29,767 --> 00:20:31,733
That's really impressive.

227
00:20:31,733 --> 00:20:35,367
Every time I collected a page,

228
00:20:35,367 --> 00:20:38,533
it felt like my own medal of honor.

229
00:20:38,533 --> 00:20:42,700
Because I was with them 24 hours a day

230
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:48,100
as their training coach, as a rehabilitation therapist, and as a nutritionist.

231
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:53,900
I'm trying to move Si On to make it like this as well.

232
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:56,267
Please understand.

233
00:21:09,333 --> 00:21:11,667
Shin's mother!

234
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:23,767
I realized I was never actually a mother to my two sons.

235
00:21:23,767 --> 00:21:29,167
Don't make the same mistakes I did, Si On's mom.

236
00:21:52,533 --> 00:21:56,267
Excuse me, Si On's mother.

237
00:22:00,733 --> 00:22:03,600
Hey, Shin! Lee Shin.

238
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:07,867
If the termination agreement has been sent, that is enough, but why call a busy person here?

239
00:22:07,867 --> 00:22:11,067
It's you, right? You're the one who spread the video of our Shin. Right?

240
00:22:11,067 --> 00:22:12,267
Good god!

241
00:22:12,267 --> 00:22:13,967
Don't come close. You have bad breath!

242
00:22:13,967 --> 00:22:15,967
And this is a custom-fit suit!

243
00:22:15,967 --> 00:22:19,033
Well, I just stated facts. Did I commit forgery or something?

244
00:22:19,033 --> 00:22:23,567
Thanks to you, CEO Hong, the ad agency cut ties with us first,

245
00:22:23,567 --> 00:22:26,133
and we don't even have to pay the penalty. Right?

246
00:22:26,133 --> 00:22:28,767
Yeah, I'm the one who tipped them off.

247
00:22:28,767 --> 00:22:31,500
It's kind of like a deposit.

248
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:33,733
Let's say you make a comeback after a year.

249
00:22:33,733 --> 00:22:35,800
How would I know where you would go?

250
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:38,133
You have to contract with a big agency like ours

251
00:22:38,133 --> 00:22:43,600
to completely clean up your negative image, and rehabilitate your career.

252
00:22:45,533 --> 00:22:47,433
There he comes.

253
00:22:47,433 --> 00:22:51,267
Since you'll obviously join that rookie agency just because the CEO is your family,

254
00:22:51,267 --> 00:22:55,267
I need to half-ruin it, so you'll understand how tough this industry really is. Right?

255
00:22:55,267 --> 00:22:56,333
Oops.

256
00:22:56,333 --> 00:22:58,600
I heard that even Cha Si On terminated her contract with your agency.

257
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:01,067
Are you shutting down now?

258
00:23:01,067 --> 00:23:04,600
Look at you. You've totally turned into a loser.

259
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:06,200
A loser, Lee Kun.

260
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:08,200
A loser? You're calling my son a loser?

261
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,633
Stop grabbing this!

262
00:23:09,633 --> 00:23:12,767
CEO Hong!

263
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,767
I made Shin sign a contract with your agency for 10 years out of loyalty.

264
00:23:31,767 --> 00:23:34,867
But what? What did you dare say to my sons?

265
00:23:34,867 --> 00:23:36,367
Jeez.

266
00:23:36,367 --> 00:23:38,700
Shin's, uh… No, ma'am!

267
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:41,400
In this business, once a contract is broken, loyalty and everything else gets trampled on,

268
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:44,633
tossed aside, and you're left hanging. That's just how it works.

269
00:23:44,633 --> 00:23:48,267
Are you talking about loyalty without realizing how scary the big agencies are?

270
00:23:48,267 --> 00:23:50,300
I'm a former lawyer!

271
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:51,667
You know what a lawyer is, right?

272
00:23:51,667 --> 00:23:54,433
Judges, prosecutors! They're all my friends. I have many friends in the court.

273
00:23:54,433 --> 00:23:57,833
You know a judge? Don't laugh!

274
00:23:59,567 --> 00:24:00,767
I mean…

275
00:24:00,767 --> 00:24:06,967
How did Si On's mother get here…

276
00:24:10,367 --> 00:24:12,233
This is all a misunderstanding.

277
00:24:12,233 --> 00:24:15,733
It's like a situation play…

278
00:24:15,733 --> 00:24:20,100
If Player Lee Shin hadn't called, I would have been fooled too.

279
00:24:21,333 --> 00:24:23,733
It's a collaboration with Ju Yeon.

280
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:29,933
I'll wait for you only while my daughter is in rehabilitation.

281
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:41,000
Oh my, this contract…

282
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:10,000
No, I…

283
00:25:20,933 --> 00:25:25,567
It's my first time drinking with my sons.

284
00:25:25,567 --> 00:25:29,267
I never let you drink alcohol since you were an athlete.

285
00:25:29,267 --> 00:25:32,200
I've drunk without you guys knowing,

286
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:34,667
but it's my first time seeing Mom drink.

287
00:25:34,667 --> 00:25:37,367
I'm a heavy drinker.

288
00:25:42,033 --> 00:25:44,700
Shall I tell you a funny story?

289
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:51,280
When there was that accident 15 years ago,

290
00:25:52,033 --> 00:25:56,267
when Kun injured his wrist trying to save Shin,

291
00:25:56,267 --> 00:25:59,160
do you know what I was thinking?

292
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:04,060
I thought it would have been better if Shin got hurt.

293
00:26:05,367 --> 00:26:10,230
I thought it would be better if Shin's wrist was broken, not the athlete Kun.

294
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:17,200
I'm cruel, right?

295
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:32,200
I was originally an ace volleyball player.

296
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:36,333
I damaged my growth plate due to poor management.

297
00:26:36,333 --> 00:26:39,367
As a volleyball player, I couldn't grow tall,

298
00:26:39,367 --> 00:26:42,810
so I went from the court to the warm-up zone.

299
00:26:43,767 --> 00:26:47,440
But after seeing Kun's athletic ability,

300
00:26:48,133 --> 00:26:51,167
my heart fluttered again.

301
00:26:51,167 --> 00:26:53,133
My son could do it.

302
00:26:53,133 --> 00:26:56,460
I thought I should teach him everything generously.

303
00:27:00,333 --> 00:27:02,600
We pulled out the deposit for our rental,

304
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:05,667
made your dad retire,

305
00:27:05,667 --> 00:27:08,967
and even scraped together his severance pay

306
00:27:08,967 --> 00:27:12,833
to send all the money for Kun's coaching and immigration costs to Australia,

307
00:27:12,833 --> 00:27:15,800
but Kun's wrist got injured.

308
00:27:20,333 --> 00:27:23,490
It must have broken Kun's heart,

309
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:26,530
so I shouldn't have done that.

310
00:27:27,267 --> 00:27:31,870
I thought Shin would be able to do it at least, if Kun couldn't do it.

311
00:27:33,333 --> 00:27:35,167
To Shin,

312
00:27:35,167 --> 00:27:38,733
I placed on him all the crowns originally meant for Kun.

313
00:27:38,733 --> 00:27:41,033
"You must do well."

314
00:27:41,033 --> 00:27:43,567
"You have to do both your part and your brother's."

315
00:27:43,567 --> 00:27:47,000
"Your brother's dreams were hurt because of you."

316
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,770
"You must fulfill them all in his stead."

317
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:58,333
I brainwashed him, over and over again.

318
00:27:58,333 --> 00:28:01,970
I thought that was for the sake of my two sons.

319
00:28:09,433 --> 00:28:11,370
No.

320
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:14,990
On second thought,

321
00:28:16,433 --> 00:28:19,400
the grades you received,

322
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:23,200
the medals, the career,

323
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:26,910
all of it felt like it was mine.

324
00:28:28,867 --> 00:28:31,330
Through you, I…

325
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:35,970
I wanted to achieve the dreams I never could.

326
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,860
Shin.

327
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:48,020
It's time to stop.

328
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:53,400
You can stop sacrificing for the family.

329
00:28:54,033 --> 00:28:56,610
You've done enough.

330
00:29:02,633 --> 00:29:04,510
Kun.

331
00:29:07,733 --> 00:29:13,710
Don't get hurt because of your greedy and selfish mom.

332
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:18,770
If your life is hurt because of me,

333
00:29:23,967 --> 00:29:27,560
then your life would be too pitiful.

334
00:29:35,267 --> 00:29:37,940
When there is thunder and lightning,

335
00:29:38,767 --> 00:29:41,200
that's when I felt it.

336
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:44,190
The embrace of the mother I longed for…

337
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:48,340
"Now I have to hold you…"

338
00:29:50,833 --> 00:29:52,550
That's what I thought.

339
00:30:07,233 --> 00:30:09,500
Kun.

340
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:24,010
I'm sorry to you guys.

341
00:30:24,633 --> 00:30:29,200
Parents aren't born as parents, right?

342
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:31,767
She wasn't a mother from the beginning,

343
00:30:31,767 --> 00:30:35,080
and I wasn't a father from the start. Right?

344
00:30:35,767 --> 00:30:38,350
I'm sorry for not being good parents.

345
00:30:40,267 --> 00:30:42,660
I'm sorry.

346
00:30:43,733 --> 00:30:44,800
I'm sorry to you guys.

347
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:47,700
- Mom. 
 - Dad.

348
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:49,790
I love you.

349
00:30:57,333 --> 00:31:01,533
Oh, what a relief! Isn't it great?

350
00:31:01,533 --> 00:31:04,567
Oh my, it's so nice.

351
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:11,500
You saw CEO Hong earlier, right?

352
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:15,267
He probably has a palm tattoo on his back by now.

353
00:31:15,267 --> 00:31:18,233
What a foul temper…

354
00:31:18,233 --> 00:31:20,167
Did you just say that to me?

355
00:31:20,167 --> 00:31:22,333
Did I? When?

356
00:31:22,333 --> 00:31:24,100
What…

357
00:31:25,267 --> 00:31:28,767
Ugh, that refrigerator is really noisy.

358
00:31:29,933 --> 00:31:32,000
Kun,

359
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:37,133
do you know why your mom brought a refrigerator into this room?

360
00:31:37,133 --> 00:31:39,660
I know that.

361
00:31:40,233 --> 00:31:42,200
She just wondered what you were doing.

362
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:45,633
But it was awkward to just open the door and look,

363
00:31:45,633 --> 00:31:48,467
so she made up an excuse about taking out side dishes,

364
00:31:48,467 --> 00:31:51,400
and looked inside more. Right?

365
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:59,300
Lying here all together makes me think of the old days.

366
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:01,600
Do you guys remember?

367
00:32:02,667 --> 00:32:06,333
When Kun was assessed as a tennis prodigy,

368
00:32:06,333 --> 00:32:08,667
we wanted to teach you well.

369
00:32:08,667 --> 00:32:13,580
So we took out the lease deposit and we all crammed into a tiny room.

370
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:18,033
Ah, even though we lived in a tiny room,

371
00:32:18,033 --> 00:32:22,450
we were so happy being all together.

372
00:32:24,767 --> 00:32:27,133
Hey, you guys might not know,

373
00:32:27,133 --> 00:32:30,167
but when you guys were sleeping next to us,

374
00:32:30,167 --> 00:32:32,267
we'd done everything, even slept together.

375
00:32:32,267 --> 00:32:34,467
- Oh my, goodness, what nonsense. 
 - Jeez.

376
00:32:34,467 --> 00:32:36,133
Ah, why? You said it was thrilling.

377
00:32:36,133 --> 00:32:39,200
- What are you saying? I can't hear it. 
 - Oh my.

378
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:42,267
Is it really tinnitus? I hear something strange.

379
00:32:42,267 --> 00:32:43,633
Right? Brother, you can't hear it either. Right?

380
00:32:43,633 --> 00:32:47,367
Really, why are they saying things like that?

381
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:50,333
The fact is...

382
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:53,167
I wasn't sleeping that day.

383
00:32:53,167 --> 00:32:55,200
- Hey! 
 - What?

384
00:32:58,667 --> 00:33:01,233
It's a joke.

385
00:33:01,233 --> 00:33:03,533
A joke?

386
00:33:03,533 --> 00:33:06,033
Jeez, he makes the strangest jokes.

387
00:33:06,033 --> 00:33:07,500
You're really just kidding, right?

388
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:11,033
Did you see something that day? No?

389
00:33:11,033 --> 00:33:13,700
But, Kun, what's gotten into you? You are even making jokes.

390
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:17,167
What? We were just sleeping.

391
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:20,600
Kun knows how to make everyone laugh.

392
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:22,967
That's right, oh my.

393
00:33:22,967 --> 00:33:25,200
   
 I'm Brain Research Center Director Yoon Te Oh. 

394
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:27,567
 Valuing each and every life, 

395
00:33:27,567 --> 00:33:30,533
 with the heart of a family, Hanseom Hospital Neurosurgery is with you. 

396
00:33:30,533 --> 00:33:32,700
Jeez, how can he be…

397
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:35,800
That guy's obnoxiousness just comes through the screen.

398
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:37,900
That hypocritical punk.

399
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:47,433
It's a complete mess because there's no Dr. Kyeong here.

400
00:33:47,433 --> 00:33:52,467
I heard there was a rumor going around that the items delivered to the lab were rebated.

401
00:33:54,033 --> 00:33:59,300
But why do you call her Dr. Kyeong instead of calling her Elsa?

402
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:03,900
Actually, Dr. Kyeong seems cold because she's such a perfectionist.

403
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:09,567
But she does all the menial lab work herself. There's no such a person like her.

404
00:34:12,967 --> 00:34:14,300
Auntie!

405
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:17,100
Yes, Seung Hyun. What's wrong?

406
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:20,367
Take me to pretty auntie.

407
00:34:20,367 --> 00:34:23,867
I heard that pretty auntie is still in Seoul.

408
00:34:23,867 --> 00:34:27,800
Huh? What do you mean? Sae Yan didn't go back to Italy?

409
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:29,667
Shh.

410
00:34:29,667 --> 00:34:34,667
If you tell Grandma, I'll be in trouble.

411
00:34:34,667 --> 00:34:37,900
Who says that? Why would you get in trouble with Grandma?

412
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:40,080
Grandma…

413
00:34:40,767 --> 00:34:44,633
Grandma chased away the pretty auntie.

414
00:34:44,633 --> 00:34:46,333
What?

415
00:34:46,333 --> 00:34:48,400
Grandma…

416
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:52,200
I overheard Grandma talking with the pretty auntie's mom.

417
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:56,567
I heard that pretty auntie is in Seoul with her dad.

418
00:34:56,567 --> 00:34:59,700
She's in Seoul with her dad?

419
00:35:01,233 --> 00:35:02,467
- Mom? 
 - Yeah?

420
00:35:02,467 --> 00:35:06,167
Is Sae Yan with her biological father now? She did not go to Italy?

421
00:35:06,167 --> 00:35:08,967
Sae Yan was chased away? What's going on?

422
00:35:08,967 --> 00:35:13,600
I didn't chase her away. Sae Yan's mom came and took her.

423
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:17,033
She insisted on not going, so I had to say a few words.

424
00:35:17,033 --> 00:35:18,533
She said she's doing well. Don't worry.

425
00:35:18,533 --> 00:35:22,900
But I can't reach her. She's not someone who wouldn't contact me.

426
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:24,900
Should I keep trying to contact her?

427
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:27,300
Don't do it.

428
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:31,767
No, just… Leave Sae Yan alone.

429
00:35:31,767 --> 00:35:34,533
From now on, don't ever interfere with Sae Yan's matters.

430
00:35:34,533 --> 00:35:36,600
Just listen to me.

431
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:40,600
Seung Hyun, you need to get ready for kindergarten. Shall we go?

432
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:42,867
No…

433
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:59,090
 ­  

434
00:36:13,167 --> 00:36:16,500
Ah, the cell phone…

435
00:36:38,467 --> 00:36:39,733
Beer.

436
00:36:39,733 --> 00:36:42,700
Thank you.

437
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:43,767
Shall we toast?

438
00:36:43,767 --> 00:36:46,600
Yes, sounds good. Cheers!

439
00:36:50,033 --> 00:36:51,667
Ah, it's good.

440
00:36:51,667 --> 00:36:55,367
Well, Dad, could I possibly go out today?

441
00:36:55,367 --> 00:37:00,133
I've felt confined, and a bit bored staying in all the time.

442
00:37:00,933 --> 00:37:04,667
Oh, then shall we go shopping together?

443
00:37:04,667 --> 00:37:08,600
Or shall we go out to eat something delicious?

444
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:10,933
Oh? Sure!

445
00:37:10,933 --> 00:37:13,967
I think I should call and meet

446
00:37:13,967 --> 00:37:16,967
the community leader as well to express my gratitude.

447
00:37:16,967 --> 00:37:20,233
He helped me meet you again like this.

448
00:37:23,267 --> 00:37:28,033
I appreciate that the community leader gave me the address,

449
00:37:28,033 --> 00:37:32,600
but your mom is frantically searching for you. Let's contact him later.

450
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:34,220
The address…

451
00:37:34,967 --> 00:37:39,880
I only gave the phone number to the community leader.

452
00:37:49,933 --> 00:37:52,133
Yes, this is the car service center.

453
00:37:52,133 --> 00:37:55,033
Yes, is it about the tires?

454
00:37:55,033 --> 00:37:57,133
Yes.

455
00:37:57,133 --> 00:38:00,633
Then, if you send me the location, I'll come to you.

456
00:38:00,633 --> 00:38:03,600
Yes, understood.

457
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:08,500
I might have to step out for a bit. Can you stay alone?

458
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:13,233
Of course! I'll just be here drinking beer by myself.

459
00:38:16,833 --> 00:38:19,433
- I'll be right back. 
 - Okay.

460
00:38:45,367 --> 00:38:47,733
Oh, my head hurts.

461
00:39:29,533 --> 00:39:31,900
Did you sleep well?

462
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:44,867
What is this place?

463
00:39:44,867 --> 00:39:47,867
This is my workplace.

464
00:40:14,033 --> 00:40:17,967
I was planning to give you a surprise once the work was done.

465
00:40:17,967 --> 00:40:22,090
You've already seen it all.

466
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,167
It was taken well, right?

467
00:40:26,233 --> 00:40:30,180
This was before I met you.

468
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,010
I've always...

469
00:40:34,033 --> 00:40:38,300
been watching over you.

470
00:40:48,633 --> 00:40:50,067
 Wow. 

471
00:40:50,067 --> 00:40:53,510
 The house seemed a bit bigger when I was younger. 

472
00:41:01,933 --> 00:41:04,467
 Wow. 

473
00:41:05,367 --> 00:41:08,420
 This room is exactly the same. 

474
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:16,700
 As expected, there's no single photo of Dad. 

475
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:21,770
 Huh? 

476
00:41:37,933 --> 00:41:39,900
 What is this? 

477
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:45,033
 Did some kid drop this while playing? 

478
00:42:05,167 --> 00:42:09,133
 Good. Let's get started. 

479
00:42:33,367 --> 00:42:35,600
 It's done. 

480
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:42,267
 Please help me find Dad. 

481
00:42:43,033 --> 00:42:45,200
 Please. 

482
00:43:07,733 --> 00:43:09,767
 It's addressed to me? 

483
00:43:09,767 --> 00:43:11,700
 What's this? 

484
00:43:12,650 --> 00:43:14,030
 ­  

485
00:43:14,033 --> 00:43:17,333
 Elementary school alumni reunion? 

486
00:43:17,333 --> 00:43:20,633
 Elementary school alumni reunion, right. 

487
00:43:24,467 --> 00:43:26,933
 Yes, hello. You're the alumni president, right? 

488
00:43:26,933 --> 00:43:31,633
 Yes, I'm Jeon Sae Yan, who received the invitation to the alumni reunion. 

489
00:43:31,633 --> 00:43:36,433
 Yes, I attended that school from 2006 to 2007. 

490
00:43:36,433 --> 00:43:41,267
 If I go to the alumni reunion, can I meet someone who knows me? 

491
00:43:41,267 --> 00:43:45,100
 Actually, I'm looking for someone right now. 

492
00:43:45,100 --> 00:43:47,400
 No, no. I'm not looking for an alumnus. 

493
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:50,400
 I'm searching for my biological father. 

494
00:43:52,467 --> 00:43:55,500
 Right? I should meet them in person… 

495
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:57,500
 Ah, yes. I understand. 

496
00:43:57,500 --> 00:44:00,000
 Yes, in that case… Ah, I… 

497
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,967
 I found a medal. 

498
00:44:01,967 --> 00:44:07,867
 It says '2007 Junior Tennis' on it. 

499
00:44:07,867 --> 00:44:11,167
 Ah, is there a tennis player among the alumni? 

500
00:44:11,167 --> 00:44:16,467
 Yes, then I'll bring it with me. Yes, see you then. 

501
00:44:18,300 --> 00:44:19,900
 Great! 

502
00:44:19,900 --> 00:44:25,567
 I'll go to the alumni reunion and find Dad and the owner of the medal. 

503
00:44:55,167 --> 00:44:57,033
 Mister, don't you have an umbrella? 

504
00:44:57,033 --> 00:44:59,233
 Here, use this. 

505
00:45:00,767 --> 00:45:04,300
 Catching a cold at an old age won't get better quickly, so please use it. 

506
00:45:09,533 --> 00:45:13,467
 Then I'll leave the umbrella here, and you must use it. 

507
00:45:13,467 --> 00:45:16,633
 I'm fine, so please make sure to use it. 

508
00:45:17,500 --> 00:45:19,833
 Ah, what should I do? 

509
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:38,800
 Hello, my name is Jeon Sae Yan. 

510
00:45:41,567 --> 00:45:44,000
 Thank you. 

511
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:48,350
 - Hey, Park Seong Hoon! 
 - Huh? 

512
00:45:48,350 --> 00:45:49,970
 ­  

513
00:45:53,167 --> 00:45:59,467
   

514
00:46:06,033 --> 00:46:08,733
 Oh, right! The medal! 

515
00:46:11,433 --> 00:46:12,533
 I'm just living like an unemployed person. 

516
00:46:12,533 --> 00:46:14,533
 What are you saying? I heard you are making a lot of money, dude. 

517
00:46:14,533 --> 00:46:16,567
 - Lee Kun? 
 - Hey, Kun! 

518
00:46:16,567 --> 00:46:19,433
 Hey, over here. Here! 

519
00:46:19,433 --> 00:46:23,067
 Lee Kun, you said you wouldn't come, but here you are? 

520
00:46:23,067 --> 00:46:26,233
 Well done, come over here. 

521
00:46:28,367 --> 00:46:31,733
 Excuse me, one moment, please. How did you get here? 

522
00:46:31,733 --> 00:46:33,867
 Is there someone you are looking for? 

523
00:46:33,867 --> 00:46:35,367
 No, just a moment, please. 

524
00:46:35,367 --> 00:46:37,167
 Could you please show me your ID? 

525
00:46:37,167 --> 00:46:38,667
 Is there someone you are looking for? 

526
00:46:38,667 --> 00:46:40,300
 Could you please show me your ID? 

527
00:46:40,300 --> 00:46:42,840
 Please leave. 

528
00:47:02,733 --> 00:47:05,367
 It's done. 

529
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,700
 Hey! You! 

530
00:47:15,700 --> 00:47:17,633
 You! 

531
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:24,033
 Hey! 

532
00:47:27,833 --> 00:47:31,600
 I'm sorry. 

533
00:47:45,667 --> 00:47:48,233
 My medal… 

534
00:47:48,233 --> 00:47:50,500
 My medal. 

535
00:47:50,500 --> 00:47:53,500
 - Excuse me. 
 - Just a moment. 

536
00:47:55,367 --> 00:47:58,200
 Where did the person with this medal go? 

537
00:47:58,200 --> 00:47:59,800
 She was here a few minutes ago. 

538
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:02,033
 Oh, there! 

539
00:48:26,833 --> 00:48:29,933
 How about it? Let's see each other again. 

540
00:48:29,933 --> 00:48:31,267
 What? What? 

541
00:48:31,267 --> 00:48:33,600
 And now, 

542
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:35,767
 let's break up! 

543
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:53,200
 So you've been following me? 

544
00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:04,833
Lee Shin…

545
00:49:04,833 --> 00:49:07,500
Then who is the person who threatened Lee Shin?

546
00:49:07,500 --> 00:49:10,667
I can't just let go of the guy who bullied you.

547
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:18,233
This guy retired thanks to me.

548
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,570
Do you like my gift for you?

549
00:49:27,667 --> 00:49:29,867
Ju Yeon.

550
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:36,233
You didn't mess with Ju Yeon's family, right?

551
00:49:36,233 --> 00:49:39,600
Please don't hurt them. They didn't bully me.

552
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:42,433
Everyone has been really nice to me. Like a real family.

553
00:49:42,433 --> 00:49:46,333
They have been the people I loved the most since I was young.

554
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:49,667
Oh my, my daughter.

555
00:49:49,667 --> 00:49:53,580
My daughter, you're so naive, so it makes me worry.

556
00:49:54,533 --> 00:49:59,130
Why do you think those people are being so nice to you?

557
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:02,400
What does that mean…

558
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:04,733
Those people.

559
00:50:04,733 --> 00:50:07,450
They are trying to get revenge on you.

560
00:50:09,467 --> 00:50:10,767
Revenge?

561
00:50:10,767 --> 00:50:13,300
Revenge for her own father.

562
00:50:13,300 --> 00:50:16,033
Ju Yeon's father?

563
00:50:16,033 --> 00:50:18,320
Don't worry.

564
00:50:19,467 --> 00:50:23,960
They should know if they bully my daughter, their own daughter will also be in danger.

565
00:50:25,133 --> 00:50:27,667
Don't worry.

566
00:50:27,667 --> 00:50:29,867
Let's just see.

567
00:50:29,867 --> 00:50:35,080
It would be safest for you to stay here for now.

568
00:50:45,333 --> 00:50:48,900
Dad. Dad.

569
00:50:50,433 --> 00:50:53,033
Dad! Dad!

570
00:50:53,033 --> 00:50:56,033
Dad, please open the door!

571
00:50:56,033 --> 00:50:58,900
Ah, please!

572
00:51:13,867 --> 00:51:16,860
You know it's a fake pain.

573
00:51:18,333 --> 00:51:22,680
Please don't call the doctor.

574
00:51:28,333 --> 00:51:30,467
I can't call her anymore.

575
00:51:30,467 --> 00:51:34,790
Because Dr. Kyeong is going to resign.

576
00:51:36,067 --> 00:51:39,867
I heard that she will be facing the disciplinary review

577
00:51:39,867 --> 00:51:42,880
that will soon take place at the ethics committee alone.

578
00:51:46,367 --> 00:51:50,020
That has nothing to do with me.

579
00:51:51,567 --> 00:51:53,133
This experiment.

580
00:51:53,133 --> 00:51:57,790
Before you, there was someone who volunteered as a test subject.

581
00:51:58,533 --> 00:52:00,720
Dr. Kyeong.

582
00:52:05,167 --> 00:52:09,010
Dr. Kyeong also has memories she wants to erase.

583
00:52:11,333 --> 00:52:14,533
Her father is Professor Kyeong Sang Hyun.

584
00:52:14,533 --> 00:52:18,133
He listened to all the noisy conversations from the patients.

585
00:52:18,133 --> 00:52:22,933
He was famous for his high reputation in mental health.

586
00:52:22,933 --> 00:52:25,670
But at the place where he went for medical volunteer work,

587
00:52:27,133 --> 00:52:29,500
he was brutally murdered

588
00:52:29,500 --> 00:52:32,000
by a patient.

589
00:52:33,233 --> 00:52:35,800
And Dr. Kyeong

590
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:39,050
happened to see it herself.

591
00:52:39,533 --> 00:52:41,800
At just 13 years old.

592
00:52:47,133 --> 00:52:49,933
 Ah, Dad. 

593
00:52:49,933 --> 00:52:52,733
- The clinic was stained with blood. 
  - Ju Yeon. 

594
00:52:52,733 --> 00:52:55,900
Her father closing his eyes in pain.

595
00:52:55,900 --> 00:52:58,300
The face of that murderer.

596
00:52:58,300 --> 00:53:01,830
She probably wanted to erase all her memories.

597
00:53:02,633 --> 00:53:07,333
She forgot all her memories because of the shock.

598
00:53:07,333 --> 00:53:12,260
But she remembers the face of the murderer clearly.

599
00:53:13,167 --> 00:53:16,270
She is still suffering from the trauma.

600
00:53:20,300 --> 00:53:25,240
That's why she is even more concerned about you.

601
00:53:25,867 --> 00:53:28,080
Because she's like you.

602
00:53:32,767 --> 00:53:37,000
You might not let go of your feelings,

603
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:41,820
but Dr. Kyeong tried to protect you until the end, Mr. Lee.

604
00:53:46,333 --> 00:53:49,020
She deceived and used me.

605
00:53:50,700 --> 00:53:54,920
She experimented with my feelings, like a lab rat.

606
00:53:57,533 --> 00:54:01,160
I can never forgive her.

607
00:55:07,340 --> 00:55:12,133
♫  At the end of every day  ♫

608
00:55:12,133 --> 00:55:16,240
 Some things don't change, even when everything else does. 

609
00:55:17,533 --> 00:55:18,833
 It's wonderful, right? 

610
00:55:18,833 --> 00:55:20,710
 That's right. 

611
00:55:22,933 --> 00:55:25,020
 That's cool. 

612
00:55:27,100 --> 00:55:34,930
♫  You were warmer than anyone else  ♫

613
00:55:36,067 --> 00:55:42,570
♫  It's okay  ♫

614
00:55:43,367 --> 00:55:52,800
♫  Even if you fall into an abyss  ♫

615
00:55:54,000 --> 00:56:00,167
♫  That day will become so bright it dazzles your eyes  ♫

616
00:56:00,167 --> 00:56:07,100
♫  Even if your footsteps are still heavy  ♫

617
00:56:07,100 --> 00:56:09,367
Ah, Player Lee Shin.

618
00:56:09,367 --> 00:56:14,467
Ah, I forgot to report while reading the book.

619
00:56:14,467 --> 00:56:19,400
Brother seems to be getting better.

620
00:56:19,400 --> 00:56:23,150
We've also made a promise to have at least one meal a day together as a family.

621
00:56:23,833 --> 00:56:27,670
And he goes out, even if it is just to the hospital.

622
00:56:28,733 --> 00:56:30,933
That's fortunate.

623
00:56:30,933 --> 00:56:34,800
I'm sorry for the inconvenience every day.

624
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:37,390
I'm the one who's more grateful.

625
00:56:38,067 --> 00:56:43,333
Thanks to you, I've felt this way for the first time.

626
00:56:43,333 --> 00:56:45,570
I have my real family now.

627
00:56:47,100 --> 00:56:51,467
But I haven't told him yet.

628
00:56:51,467 --> 00:56:53,590
About what?

629
00:56:55,733 --> 00:56:58,667
About his real first love.

630
00:56:58,667 --> 00:57:00,800
I couldn't tell Sae Yan, either.

631
00:57:00,800 --> 00:57:03,133
Because Sae Yan suddenly left.

632
00:57:03,133 --> 00:57:05,167
She left?

633
00:57:05,167 --> 00:57:07,767
Where did she go to?

634
00:57:07,767 --> 00:57:09,833
 Because Sae Yan found her dad. 

635
00:57:09,833 --> 00:57:12,033
She's with her dad,

636
00:57:12,033 --> 00:57:15,740
but strangely, I can't get in touch with her.

637
00:57:30,833 --> 00:57:32,667
There's a quick delivery for Ms. Kyeong Ju Yeon.

638
00:57:32,667 --> 00:57:35,333
Yes, please leave it here. Thank you.

639
00:57:35,333 --> 00:57:37,940
- Thank you. 
 - Yes.

640
00:57:57,200 --> 00:58:01,567
   

641
00:58:19,733 --> 00:58:21,667
Excuse me!

642
00:58:21,667 --> 00:58:24,200
Is there anybody there?

643
00:58:40,367 --> 00:58:44,560
Ju Yeon's family wants to take revenge on me?

644
00:58:45,267 --> 00:58:47,220
But why?

645
00:58:48,867 --> 00:58:52,120
Revenge for Ju Yeon's father?

646
00:58:54,933 --> 00:58:56,500
Surely not…

647
00:58:56,500 --> 00:59:00,367
All right, then I'll hang up.

648
00:59:07,700 --> 00:59:11,950
Excuse me, you dropped this.

649
00:59:17,533 --> 00:59:19,933
Excuse me, this…

650
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:41,233
Isn't this yours, sir?

651
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:45,233
 Ju Yeon! 

652
00:59:48,867 --> 00:59:51,033
Ju Yeon.

653
00:59:51,033 --> 00:59:54,167
Uh, Mom, just a moment.

654
01:00:02,033 --> 01:00:06,900
Why aren't you coming in? What are you doing there? Who's that?

655
01:00:06,900 --> 01:00:07,933
No, nothing.

656
01:00:07,933 --> 01:00:09,533
But why are you out here?

657
01:00:09,533 --> 01:00:15,433
Huh? Sae Yan… I mean, I was waiting for you.

658
01:00:15,433 --> 01:00:17,633
Don't be out late at night.

659
01:00:17,633 --> 01:00:19,133
I'm always out late, nothing ever happened.

660
01:00:19,133 --> 01:00:21,700
Let's get inside now.

661
01:00:21,700 --> 01:00:23,933
It's okay.

662
01:00:23,933 --> 01:00:25,870
It's chilly outside.

663
01:00:55,967 --> 01:00:57,650
Here it is.

664
01:01:01,667 --> 01:01:03,280
Huh?

665
01:01:05,600 --> 01:01:07,130
This.

666
01:01:12,533 --> 01:01:14,690
Your last medal.

667
01:01:16,367 --> 01:01:19,333
Your first love left it at the alumni reunion.

668
01:01:19,333 --> 01:01:20,940
Do you remember?

669
01:01:21,733 --> 01:01:24,067
I've been keeping it.

670
01:01:24,067 --> 01:01:28,200
Thankfully, your first love

671
01:01:28,200 --> 01:01:30,033
saved you and

672
01:01:30,033 --> 01:01:31,850
found that medal.

673
01:01:35,933 --> 01:01:38,767
If it's about Ms. Kyeong Ju Yeon, that's enough.

674
01:01:38,767 --> 01:01:40,580
No.

675
01:01:41,167 --> 01:01:43,260
Your real first love.

676
01:01:44,867 --> 01:01:46,760
Aren't you curious about her?

677
01:01:51,067 --> 01:01:53,400
It's someone you know.

678
01:01:55,050 --> 01:02:03,780


679
01:02:05,100 --> 01:02:07,500
 Is it Sae Yan? 

680
01:02:07,500 --> 01:02:09,920
 Sae Yan is that girl? 

681
01:02:10,833 --> 01:02:12,590
 Are you okay? 

682
01:02:13,367 --> 01:02:15,490
 Open your eyes. 

683
01:02:21,600 --> 01:02:23,510
 Are you okay? 

684
01:02:25,167 --> 01:02:29,500
 Why have all the other memories returned 

685
01:02:29,500 --> 01:02:32,633
 but the memory of the first love is still the same? 

686
01:02:35,300 --> 01:02:38,240
 Why do I still have the memory of Kyeong Ju Yeon? 

687
01:02:41,720 --> 01:02:44,430
 ­  

688
01:02:44,433 --> 01:02:47,967
♫  Drowning  ♫

689
01:02:47,967 --> 01:02:54,300
♫  In an ocean of grey  ♫

690
01:02:55,967 --> 01:02:59,400
♫  Running  ♫

691
01:02:59,400 --> 01:03:03,200
♫  Running backwards to you  ♫

692
01:03:03,200 --> 01:03:07,300
   

693
01:03:07,300 --> 01:03:09,267
 The ethics committee will now commence. 

694
01:03:09,267 --> 01:03:11,000
 As the person in charge of this clinical trial, 

695
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:14,933
 I demand the suspension of the experiment that caused the side effects. 

696
01:03:14,933 --> 01:03:18,267
 She's a grown adult, but I'm wondering if that qualifies for a missing person report. 

697
01:03:18,267 --> 01:03:20,533
 Why would Ms. Jeon Sae Yan's father try to harm Shin? 

698
01:03:20,533 --> 01:03:23,133
 112 won? Emergency number… 

699
01:03:23,133 --> 01:03:26,200
 Here, please save me. 

700
01:03:26,200 --> 01:03:29,633
 Could that person possibly harm his family, too? 

701
01:03:29,633 --> 01:03:31,433
 I have to protect Ju Yeon. 

702
01:03:31,433 --> 01:03:33,400
 I have to get out of here, no matter what. 

703
01:03:33,400 --> 01:03:37,080
 What do you mean you can't get in touch with her?
