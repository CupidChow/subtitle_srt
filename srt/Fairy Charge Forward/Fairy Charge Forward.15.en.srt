How is it?

22

How much did we make?

23
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,320
We lost ten strings of coins.

24
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:32,400
Huh?

25
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:35,200
How can it be?
Our business was doing well, right?

26
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:37,760
It's all because of that new shop
across the street.

27
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:38,880
Whatever goods we stock,

28
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:39,840
they follow suit

29
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,240
and price theirs three coins
cheaper than ours.

30
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:45,320
But haven't we always
set our prices lower than theirs?

31
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:47,640
Didn't all the customers come to us?

32
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,440
But we've set the prices too low.

33
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:52,000
On the surface,
it looks like we're selling a lot.

34
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,360
But in reality, it's all for nothing.

35
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:56,080
We even lost money on transport

36
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,160
and labor fees.

37
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,560
Huh?

38
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:00,440
How could this happen?

39
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:03,000
No way.

40
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,200
I must find a way.

41
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,160
Master.

42
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,080
Master.

43
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:16,800
The City Lord sent someone again

44
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:17,920
asking when you'll attend.

45
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,200
I'm still recovering from my cold.

46
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,560
I can't do anything right now.

47
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,800
But the physician has come several times

48
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:27,860
saying you've recovered.

49
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,800
I'm afraid this excuse won't hold up.

50
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,400
(Business hasn't been
going well recently.)

51
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:49,760
(Maybe)

52
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,880
(I should borrow some luck again?)

53
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,000
Don't get it wrong.

54
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,480
I don't mean to take advantage of you.

55
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:19,480
Oh?

56
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:20,760
Really, I swear.

57
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:22,600
I just want to

58
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:25,520
borrow a bit of your good luck.

59
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,920
Ziyi said you were
a bringer of good fortune,

60
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:29,840
so I was thinking
maybe rubbing you

61
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,040
could change my misfortune.

62
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,440
You aren't mad at me, are you?

63
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:38,800
So, did it help?

64
00:03:40,850 --> 00:03:43,480
At first, even though the warehouse
caught fire on the opening day,

65
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:44,640
business was booming.

66
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,720
But now,

67
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:49,640
a new shop across the street
is stealing our business every day.

68
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,080
On the opening day?

69
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,040
Yes.

70
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,240
Don't be mad.

71
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:55,040
I'll bring you some Monkey Wine tonight.

72
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,080
What's wrong?

73
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:04,000
(Then I'll lend you some more luck.)

82
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,280
These ordinary rocks
from Changliu Mountain

83
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:45,160
are neither gold nor jade.

84
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,080
Yet with a few carvings and inscriptions,

85
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,200
they sell for five taels of gold.

86
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,680
That's because Xiao Ziqi carved well.

87
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,760
Try having someone else do it.

88
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:59,120
Look at the shop across the street
that imitates us.

89
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,680
No one buys from them at all.

90
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,040
Hey,

91
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,800
why don't we take advantage of this

92
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,440
and ask him to carve a few more?

93
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,240
Carving is exhausting.

94
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,480
He's been busy with official duties

95
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,400
and caught a cold recently.

96
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:14,400
Let's not bother him.

97
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:21,240
Since when did you start
caring about him,

98
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:22,040
huh?

99
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,080
I've thought of a plan.

100
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,080
What plan?

101
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:34,640
Scarcity marketing.

102
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:36,560
You want that too?

103
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,360
(We'll hold a lottery.)

104
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:40,800
(If anyone wants to buy the seal,)

105
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:41,880
(they have to draw lots.)

106
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,360
(Only those who win
get the right to buy.)

107
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:44,920
(Moreover,)

108
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,160
(the winning rate will be low.)

109
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,160
(Then we'll display the seal)

110
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,120
(prominently in the shop.)

111
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,440
(Those who want them)

112
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,040
(can come and look,)

113
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:53,680
(but)

114
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:54,860
(won't be able to buy.)

115
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,600
(While they're at it,)

116
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,240
(aside from signing up for the seal,)

117
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,560
(they'll buy other things.)

118
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,320
(That's how)

119
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,480
(the business will come.)

120
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:03,800
What should we do?

121
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,120
Our customers are being stolen.

122
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,160
You all have a chance.

123
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,920
If Master Wang knows, he'll blame us.

124
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:08,760
Yes.

125
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:09,560
Here's the money.

126
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:11,320
Let's go.

127
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:35,200
I brought you some delicacies
from Fragrance Pavilion.

128
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,480
Have a taste.

129
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,360
This is

130
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:42,800
Peach Blossom Wine,
eight taels a bottle.

131
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:46,480
And your favorite Lotus Rice Porridge.

132
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:48,180
I wrapped it in cloth
and it's still warm.

133
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:52,880
Got burned?

134
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:57,120
Are you OK?

135
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,120
I'm fine.

136
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,000
I'm full.

137
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:16,760
Eat a little more.

138
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:19,280
I walked dozens of miles
to pick these lotus leaves.

139
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,400
The chef at Fragrance Pavilion said

140
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:27,390
they couldn't make
the porridge without them.

141
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:28,760
I didn't believe that,

142
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:29,960
so I went miles

143
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:31,720
and picked the leaves.

144
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,560
If it's good, have a bit more.

145
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:35,680
OK.

146
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,400
How's your shop doing these days?

147
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,520
Great, it's been so great.

148
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:47,080
Our shop is the busiest
on the whole street.

149
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:52,440
So, the good luck must be working.

150
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:56,280
There's indeed some magic at work here.

151
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:58,680
Do you want

152
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:00,840
to try again?

153
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,880
No, that's enough.

154
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:07,600
You helped me once already.

155
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:09,400
How...

156
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:11,640
How could I trouble you again?

157
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:14,820
(Senior Master Mansion)

158
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:19,290
(Hurting her may be easy,
but getting her back is agony.)

159
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:22,920
(Hurting her may be easy,
but getting her back is agony.)

160
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:25,400
Sancai.

161
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:31,520
Check outside

162
00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:33,400
and see whose parrot
is making that noise.

163
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,100
I'll file a noise complaint.

164
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,600
Seems like it's Wang Qian's.

165
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:39,640
Which Wang Qian?

166
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:41,320
The son of Minister Wang.

167
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:50,880
Here, Master.

168
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,200
The City Lord said

169
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,440
he expects to see you today.

170
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,160
I'm not recovered from my cold

171
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:00,660
and don't want to spread it to him.

172
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,880
But Officer Sun is waiting outside.

173
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,080
He said if you're still unwell,

174
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,040
they'll carry you over.

175
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:09,480
Got it.

176
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,480
The shop in the west market

177
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,040
has stolen our business again.

178
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,760
Then use the old method.

179
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:25,840
Got it.

180
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:27,620
I'll send someone to burn it down.

181
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,520
Can you use your brain for once?

182
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:34,920
(Wang Qian)
If it's a business matter,

183
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:37,480
(son of Minister Wang)
resolve it through business tactics.

184
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,780
That way, the Wang family can maintain
its reputation for being virtuous.

185
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:42,280
Understood?

186
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:42,800
Yes.

187
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,360
So...

188
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:46,920
Offer them some money

189
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:50,120
to take over the shop.

190
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:51,480
Understood.

191
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,280
Here.

192
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:56,040
Well.

193
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,800
My Baby.

194
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:03,120
Where's Baby?

195
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:07,040
Where's my Baby?

196
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:07,760
Well...

197
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:08,880
It was just here yesterday.

198
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:17,480
Oh, my poor Baby.

199
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,880
He was raised in this mansion,

200
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:23,200
enjoying luxury all its life.

201
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:26,360
How will he survive out there alone?

202
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,120
Thief!

203
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,520
Don't let me catch you.

204
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,000
If I did,

205
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,800
