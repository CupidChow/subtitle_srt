00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:01,480
How are you feeling?

10
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,720
Father, I'm much better.

11
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:10,880
Official Li

12
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:12,160
will depart tomorrow.

13
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:15,360
But don't worry,

14
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:17,340
he won't be exiled to Lingnan,

15
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:18,840
but to Jiangzhou instead.

16
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:21,200
If there's a chance in the future,

17
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:22,520
he might be reinstated.

18
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,080
Thank you, Father.

19
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:28,160
Ziqi,

20
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:29,960
have you heard the news

21
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,160
about Princess coming?

22
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:33,400
Yes.

23
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:35,880
The marriage to Shaozhou is approaching,

24
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,080
but you're hiding
a woman in your mansion.

25
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:40,560
Are you doing it on purpose?

26
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:43,680
Lipei is no ordinary woman.

27
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,400
Princess has implied
she has feelings for you.

28
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,560
I don't oppose you taking a concubine,

29
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,880
but first, you must have

30
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,680
a wife with a formal marriage.

31
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:54,840
Enough.

32
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,280
No need to argue further.

33
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,080
(Arguing now)

34
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:02,280
(will only cause Father to blame Lipei.)

35
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,120
Understood, Father.

36
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:13,180
(Prison)

37
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:24,520
Official Li.

38
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:28,890
Senior Master, I appreciate your help
in pleading for me.

39
00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:30,690
The City Lord asked me to tell you

40
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:33,160
to take care on your exile to Jiangzhou

41
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:36,160
and not to let this dishearten you.

42
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:39,080
I've always been upright and confident

43
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,960
and I've never been accepted by many.

44
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,360
It's only because of the City Lord's
protection that I'm here today.

45
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:47,000
I have no complaints.

46
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,800
I've uncovered some clues

47
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,520
about the city's powerful figures
colluding with Shaozhou.

48
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,960
With my exile to Jiangzhou,

49
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:58,080
I won't have a chance
to investigate further.

50
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:03,800
Would you take on this responsibility
in my stead?

51
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,600
Changliu...

52
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,160
Your Highness,

53
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,720
the envoy from Yongzhou has arrived.

54
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:38,720
Alright.

55
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:40,720
Tell him to wait.

56
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,160
Help me prepare.

57
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,760
Here's the itinerary
for our first day there.

58
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:54,440
Xiao Ziqi and Xiao Ziyi
will both come to receive me?

59
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:58,000
Quite the rare honor.

60
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:00,960
Your Highness, why would you

61
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:03,880
make the City Lord of Yongzhou believe
you admire Xiao Ziqi?

62
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:08,960
It's said Xiao Ziqi
is a famous talent in Yongzhou,

63
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,960
a master of the arts.

64
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,280
Isn't that worth admiring?

65
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,760
But hasn't Lady Jun

66
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:20,440
always tried to match you with her son?

67
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:23,880
After all these years, she still hasn't
helped her son rise to power.

68
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:26,680
Thinking she can use me to achieve it

69
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,560
is rather naive.

70
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,800
So what's your plan, Your Highness?

71
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,200
If we can ally with the Wang family

72
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:36,320
and kill the City Lord of Yongzhou,

73
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:40,160
Shaozhou's army can easily
cross the border.

74
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,440
That'd be the best outcome.

75
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,840
But what if the Wang family
proves unreliable

76
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,240
and drags you down?

77
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,440
That's fine.

78
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:52,120
Xiao Ziqi isn't my aunt's son.

79
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:55,000
Since he blocked
her son's path to power,

80
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:58,280
I'll let my aunt take the blame

81
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:02,040
and no one will suspect me.

82
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:06,600
Do you intend to help her son seize
the position of Junior City Lord?

83
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,280
Either of them becomes Junior City Lord,

84
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,520
I'll still be the Lord's wife.

85
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:15,080
I'll act accordingly
when the time comes.

86
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:26,540
(Senior Master Mansion)

87
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,160
Miss Zheng.

88
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:46,600
What is it?

89
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:49,720
The City Lord is hosting a banquet
to welcome Princess.

90
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,120
Oh.

91
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:54,000
What does that have to do with me?

92
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,360
Senior Master insists
on bringing you along.

93
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:00,280
Lady Jun is concerned
you'll embarrass the City Lord

94
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:01,720
in front of the nobles,

95
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,240
so she's asked me to inform you

96
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,680
starting tomorrow, you'll be trained.

97
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,240
You must remember all our etiquettes.

98
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,800
Why do you always enter
through the side door?

99
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:31,800
It's a shortcut.

100
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:35,240
Those two earlier looked like
my mother's maids.

101
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:36,520
Why were they here?

102
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,720
They said you need to go
to the Etiquette Bureau tomorrow.

103
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,160
Etiquette Bureau?

104
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,000
I see.

105
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:54,780
My mother-in-law wants
to establish some rules for me.

106
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,440
Lipei,

107
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:03,240
Princess from Shaozhou
is coming in a few days.

108
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:06,720
Do you know the purpose of her trip

109
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,360
is marriage?

110
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:09,800
Marriage?

111
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,360
Is she marrying the City Lord?

112
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,640
The City Lord is old enough
to be her father.

113
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,400
Of course not.

114
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,560
It's not my father.

115
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:20,690
If it's not your father,

116
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:21,840
she's marrying you?

117
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,720
It can't be Xiao Ziqi.

118
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,000
Why not?

119
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:28,890
Aren't you forgetting something?

120
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:32,240
My brother Ziqi
is the Senior Master of Yongzhou.

121
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,040
The marriage alliance

122
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,480
naturally falls on his shoulders.

123
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:38,600
(Yes,)

124
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:42,360
(one day he'll become
someone else's husband.)

125
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:42,800
Lipei,

126
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,360
I want to tell you.

127
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,040
No matter when,

128
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,160
if you turn around,

129
00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:49,880
I'll always be there behind you.

130
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:52,520
OK.

131
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,640
Well, um, I should go now.

132
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,800
Weren't you here for a free meal?

133
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:02,100
I don't want to see my brother.

134
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,000
I might punch him.

135
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,000
I'm full.

136
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,000
Lipei.

137
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,120
Yes?

138
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,360
Here's the thing.

139
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,680
I want to tell you something.

140
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:29,880
Well,

141
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:33,400
looks like it's something serious.

142
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:36,560
Actually,

143
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,120
it's...

144
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:41,440
Tomorrow, Princess of Shaozhou
is coming.

145
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:43,680
It might be

146
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:45,640
for a marriage alliance with Yongzhou.

147
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:46,560
Oh,

148
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,000
I heard Ziyi mention it.

149
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:50,640
Lipei,

150
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:53,000
no matter what rumors you hear,

151
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,160
this doesn't concern you.

152
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,600
Princess isn't your concern either.

153
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,400
Of course not.

154
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,040
I'm just a commoner.

155
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,120
How could I have any connection
with the Princess?

156
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:02,240
Lipei,

157
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,000
have you ever thought about

158
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:06,880
leaving Changliu Mountain

159
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,240
one day and...

160
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:11,200
Why would I leave Changliu Mountain?

161
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:12,920
Yes.

162
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,120
You've got your fellow disciples.

163
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:18,390
You can watch plays in Qingliang Town

164
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,960
and bring a man back sometimes.

165
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:22,040
Right.

166
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:22,840
It's quite a life.

167
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,600
You're right.

168
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,160
It's about time
I look for my second husband.

169
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,920
I was joking.

170
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:39,760
I thought you were serious.

171
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:46,000
I promised my father
I'd revive the sect,

172
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,120
so I must follow through.

173
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:50,440
Moreover, I can't let the sect fall
into decline under my watch.

174
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:52,400
I won't leave

175
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,800
until I've achieved that.

176
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:57,360
Right,

177
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,480
one's word is as good as gold.

178
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:00,860
Oh, by the way,

179
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,720
I've got something to tell you.

180
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:08,960
The Etiquette Bureau?

181
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,240
Wow.

182
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:23,520
Wow.

183
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:26,520
These props are quite something.

184
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,240
Look,

185
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,520
you need to sit holding your breath

186
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:31,640
