Zheng Lipei,

10
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:09,200
you conspired
with Senior Master to rebel.

11
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:11,720
Do you plead guilty?

12
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:14,520
Whatever.

13
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,960
You've already piled
enough accusations on me.

14
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:19,560
I could open a shop selling them.

00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:20,800

00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:21,800
it doesn't matter.

17
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,240
Stubborn.

18
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:29,760
You want to say anything?

19
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:33,720
I'm willing to share Lipei's punishment.

20
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:35,160
Fine,

21
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,480
then I'll grant your wish.

22
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:38,880
Guards!

23
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:40,760
Take them to prison.

24
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:43,240
Execute them tomorrow at noon.

25
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:55,600
Hey, My Lord.

26
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:56,760
I'm a patriot.

27
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:57,720
They're the rebels.

28
00:01:58,210 --> 00:01:58,640
Don't move.

29
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:59,440
Arrest Liu Yimei

30
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,400
and his accomplices.

- Yes.
- Yes.

32
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:05,920
What's going on?

33
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:06,360
Go.

34
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:08,480
Don't move.

35
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:10,560
Get going!

36
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:15,360
Officer Sun.

37
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:16,720
Yes.

38
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:17,960
Escort them back.

39
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:18,800
Yes.

40
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,160
Please.

41
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:29,880
I still have something

42
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:31,560
to ask you.

43
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:39,640
My Lord,

44
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,200
what do you wish to ask me?

45
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:45,400
Do you recognize this?

46
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:49,800
Isn't this just a piece

47
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,200
of ordinary fabric?

48
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:53,640
What about it?

49
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,000
But the embroidery on it

50
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,320
is made with imperial silk,

51
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:00,160
and it's the pattern exclusive

52
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,960
to your embroidery workshop.

53
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:04,800
How do you explain that?

54
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,800
I gave you a chance.

55
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,360
And you?

56
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,520
What did you do with it?

57
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:21,280
My Lord,

58
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,760
I was foolish!

59
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,680
It was a moment of madness!

60
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,680
You poisoned Ziqi's medicine!

61
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:32,080
If you weren't Ziyi's mother,

62
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,120
I wouldn't have spared you.

63
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,000
From now on,

64
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,560
you'll stay in the palace
to reflect on your mistakes.

65
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,720
Don't go anywhere.

66
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,160
My Lord!

67
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:49,520
Give me that.

68
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,480
What does this symbol mean?

69
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:02,880
I'll have someone investigate.

70
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,880
This mission went very well.

71
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:08,160
Not only did we absorb
Changliu into Yongzhou,

72
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:11,040
but we also obtained
intelligence on Shaozhou.

73
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:14,880
Bai Minmin's schemes were uncovered.

74
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:18,600
I've placed her under house arrest
while notifying Shaozhou.

75
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:22,320
Shaozhou shouldn't dare
to act rashly anymore.

76
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:23,520
Yes.

77
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:25,640
The marriage alliance...

78
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:26,320
It's canceled.

79
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:29,320
I'll have people renegotiate
with Shaozhou

80
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,360
to secure more favorable terms
for Yongzhou.

81
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:33,720
Father, you're wise.

82
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:34,680
In this lifetime

83
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:37,260
I'll only marry Zheng Lipei.

84
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:40,480
I know.

85
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:41,720
You're

86
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:42,880
a lot like me.

87
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:47,320
I've loved only your mother
my entire life.

88
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,160
Since she

89
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,160
died in childbirth,

90
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,880
I've struggled to face that grief.

91
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,720
I neglected you over the years,

92
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:01,000
partly because you reminded me of her

93
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:02,690
and partly because

94
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,560
I feared favoring you too much

95
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,040
might put you in danger

96
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:07,680
from others' jealousy.

97
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:10,600
So I...

98
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:12,560
I understand

99
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,120
your true intentions, Father.

100
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:19,000
You're of age now.

101
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,560
I hope you can understand my concerns.

102
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:24,240
As for the matter of the heir,

103
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:25,960
you shouldn't refuse any longer.

104
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:30,280
Your Highness,

105
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,560
the situation is looking grim for us.

106
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:35,280
Should we retreat to Shaozhou
and reassess?

107
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,200
Chenyan,

108
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,600
do you think the black stones will win

109
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:41,960
or the white ones?

110
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,680
I'm no chess expert,

111
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:46,920
but it looks like there're
more white stones left.

112
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,000
Not quite.

113
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:51,440
The white stones may be numerous,
but they're mostly surrounded.

114
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:54,600
The black stones just need
a slight adjustment

115
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,200
to reverse the situation.

116
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,840
Although the player who moves first
has a greater chance,

117
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,800
fortunes can change

118
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,680
in an instant.

119
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:08,560
Sometimes, you have to venture
into a losing position.

120
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:09,920
You're right, Your Highness.

121
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,920
Xiao Ziqi may be riding high now,

122
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:16,680
but our people are already
embedded within Yongzhou.

123
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,920
I've sent a letter
to my father this morning

124
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,760
and he'll arrive here soon.

125
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:25,480
Changes may once again
sweep through Yongzhou.

126
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,280
(You and Ziyi are half brothers,)

127
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,520
(but with a mother like this...)

128
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:34,720
(Ziyi is my brother.)

129
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,160
(His mother isn't him.)

130
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,520
(It's good you see it that way,)

131
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:43,720
(but the court and the people won't.)

132
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,080
(Don't worry, Father.)

133
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:48,480
(I'll do everything I can
to protect him.)

134
00:06:59,240 --> 00:06:59,800
Ziyi,

135
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:01,000
I came late.

136
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:04,800
So, in the end,

137
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,390
I was the only one kept in the dark.

138
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,440
I even pleaded with father for you two,

139
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,560
crying my heart out.

140
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,000
In the end,

141
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,000
you were all playing me.

142
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,240
I...

143
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,000
Come on,

144
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:19,690
I was just joking with you.

145
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:23,720
Finally, I can roam freely
and enjoy life as I please.

146
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:24,640
Fine,

147
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,480
you've really lucked out this time.

148
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,920
You'd better not rub it in.

149
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:30,840
You got the girl,

150
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,760
so let me have

151
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:33,600
the carefree life.

152
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,120
Or do you want me to crash your wedding?

153
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,320
Thank you.

154
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:39,580
Thank you for letting us be together.

155
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:40,880
Take care of yourself.

156
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:42,360
Stay healthy.

157
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:42,960
Sure.

158
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:44,560

I thought you really agreed

to Liu Yimei for my sake.

165
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:25,800
But it turns out
this was all part of your plan.

166

It's true

167
