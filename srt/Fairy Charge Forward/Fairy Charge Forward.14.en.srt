00:00:59,080 --> 00:00:59,640
Lipei.

10
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:02,680
Why are you here?

11
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:03,800
You ran too fast.

12
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:05,080
I was chasing you.

13
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:07,240
I've seen the beggar a few times.

14
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:08,160
He's not alone.

15
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:10,040
They're professional scammers.

16
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:13,480
They show up
at ceremonies and openings.

17
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,080
Someone must've trained them.

18
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:17,320
Yes.

19
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:25,960
I've intended to clean it up
to return it to you,

20
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:27,840
but I'll have to wait until next time.

21
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:41,360
You earned so little money.

22
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:42,560
Do you have a death wish?

23
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:43,880
Boss, spare me!

24
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:45,480
I didn't want to.

25
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:47,400
There's been no business lately.

26
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,200
Dare to make excuses?

27
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:51,040
Make excuses?

28
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:52,240
Dare to make excuses?

29
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,160
I'll beat you.

30
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:56,000
Hey.

31
00:01:59,220 --> 00:01:59,640
Spare me!

32
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:00,440
Hitting a child?

33
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:01,280
Be gentle.

34
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,200
Hitting a child, are you?

35
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:06,840
I'm tired.

36
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:07,480
You, hit him!

37
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,440
You bully him, huh?

38
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:22,120
Don't be afraid.

39
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:24,080
No one will bully you anymore.

40
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:29,540
I hope the orphanage can find
a good place for the children.

41
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:30,650
But this case is suspicious.

42
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:31,880
We can't report it yet.

43
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,800
Considering how brazen they are,

44
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,080
could someone be backing them?

45
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:37,720
Could it be

46
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:39,440
those nobles and gentry again?

47
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,640
The Cui family?

48
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,120
The Wang family?

49
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:44,480
Or the Zheng family?

50
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:46,560
Don't worry.

51
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,720
I'll continue to investigate this.

52
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:51,120
Lipei, bad news!

53
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:51,720
Bad news!

54
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:53,240
Our warehouse burned down!

55
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:54,600
What?

56
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,320
Let's go.

57
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,000
The shop next door caught fire.

58
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,640
Their shop is fine,

59
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:09,680
but all our goods were burned.

60
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,760
All we've left
are these worthless rocks.

61
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:17,600
Could we be any unluckier?

62
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:23,280
I've been cursed with misfortune
since I was a child.

63
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,490
No matter what I do,
I'm a bit more unlucky than others.

64
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:27,880
People who stay close to me
also become unlucky.

65
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,240
Maybe you should stay away from me,

66
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,250
or you'll be unlucky too.

67
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:33,560
It's fine.

68
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,160
A real man stands tall and strong.

69
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:37,080
I fear nothing.

70
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:42,000
(No way, is it happening already?)

71
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,480
Who did it?

72
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,400
My basin fell.

73
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,280
Sorry.

74
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:52,120
It's nothing.

75
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:53,420
A minor incident.

76
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:54,560
A minor incident.

77
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:07,440
It's nothing.

78
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,280
A minor incident.

79
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
A minor incident.

80
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:18,680
It's nothing.

81
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:20,400
A minor incident.

82
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,280
A minor incident.

83
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:26,660
(Treasure Pavilion)

84
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:37,560
Miss Guo.

85
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:38,040
Huh?

86
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:39,440
Where's Lipei?

87
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,720
Wasn't she with Master Ziyi
looking for you at the mansion?

88
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:46,280
Weren't you opening today?

89
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,680
Don't even mention it.

90
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:51,120
That fire next door burned down
our entire warehouse,

91
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,780
leaving us with only
these worthless rocks.

92
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,520
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

93
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:11,720
Speaking of which,

94
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,440
you and my brother
are truly extraordinary.

95
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,280
You were born unlucky,

96
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:17,080
but my brother

97
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:19,480
is the bringer of good fortune
in Yongzhou.

98
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,240
Really?

99
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:21,960
Yes.

100
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,440
The day my brother was born,

101
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:26,440
flocks of magpies flew in

102
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:27,870
and circled the beams for three days.

103
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,080
All the koi fish in the city

104
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,680
leaped out of the water with a splash.

105
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,800
That day, the long-standing war

106
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,360
between Shaozhou and Yongzhou

107
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,440
ended with a treaty.

108
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,040
Since childhood, my brother

109
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:43,280
has always turned misfortune
into blessing

110
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,520
and everything he does goes smoothly.

111
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,720
I had no idea.

112
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,200
Yes.

113
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:52,240
People really are different.

114
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,760
So don't worry.

115
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:58,720
We can share some of his luck

116
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,090
and it'll counteract our bad luck.

117
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,080
Alright.

118
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,040
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

119
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,040
- Another one.
- Another!

120
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:15,280
Living in the martial world,
we all get slashed.

121
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,600
- Four strikes will kill you!
- Four strikes will kill you!

122
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,160
Ah, I won!

123
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,800
Finally, I won.

124
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:22,720
Again!

125
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:26,280
Living in the martial world,
we all get slashed.

126
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:28,960
- Four strikes will kill you!
- Huh!

127
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:31,040
Ziqi!

128
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,640
Xiao Ziqi!

129
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:34,280
Ziqi,

130
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:37,120
I brought Miss Zheng back to you
safe and sound.

131
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:38,880
Do I need to thank you?

132
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:39,440
No need.

133
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:40,560
No need for that.

134
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,680
Taking up the position
of the Junior City Lord

135
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:44,440
would be the best form of gratitude.

136
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:47,760
Escort Master Ziyi back.

137
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:05,880
I waited long for your return

138
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:06,880
and went to the shop for you

139
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,640
only to discover
you were eating with Ziyi.

140
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,200
Such good fortune must mean

141
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:16,080
you have unique qualities.

142
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:17,880
Next time you go out,

143
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:19,000
just let me know in advance.

144
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,960
I'll send someone to escort you.

145
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,000
What nonsense has Ziyi
been feeding you this time?

146
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,160

Official Li was wronged.

Why do you insist on this, Father?

160
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,240
(Xiao Shuxing)
He offended powerful officials.

(City Lord of Yongzhou)

his straightforwardness

163

will inevitably get him
into more trouble.

164

Ziqi,

168
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,560
you're too young and impulsive.

169
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:35,760
You need to understand

170
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,200
pulling back your fist

171
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:39,800
is to punch harder later.

172
00:08:41,410 --> 00:08:43,790
But if we keep pulling back,
we won't be able to punch at all.

173
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,160
What did you say?

174
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,800
Lingnan is wild and desolate

00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:52,670

of coming back from there?

these ordinary rocks

could sell for a hundred taels?

Oh,

187
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,440

from the day we opened.

188
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:42,920
Did something special happen?

189
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:46,200
Something special?

190
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:02,680
Could it

191
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,720
really be borrowed luck?

192
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:19,160
How's business at the shop lately?

193
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:20,840
Good, very good!

194
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:22,720
With your help,

195
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:23,960
those rocks

196
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:25,840
have attracted many buyers.

197
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,320
That's good.

198
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:31,240
So,

199
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:33,560
how's your work going lately?

200
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:38,440
What's wrong?

201
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,800
Are you feeling unwell?

202
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:45,080
The weather has been erratic lately.

203
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:47,320
