9
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:56,120
Master Xiao,

10
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:59,440
how did you learn
about the divine beast Chenghuang?

11
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,120
I enjoy collecting

12
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,800
unusual stories
to include in my novel.

13
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:08,320
I overheard some locals
discussing it recently

14
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:09,640
and made a note of it.

15
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:13,280
Good thing you knew about it today,

16
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:14,160
or

17
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:17,360
the Tianji Sect might've
really forced us into a corner.

18
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,080
So, Elder,

19
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:20,960
don't be angry with him anymore.

20
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,360
I hope you can overlook the past.

21
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:25,320
Forget it.

22
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,120
As long as you can redeem yourself

23
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:30,000
by writing a good sequel,

24
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:31,920
we can work something out.

25
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,560
I'll do my best

26
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:37,200
to restore Changliu Sect's honor.

27
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:44,880
I've heard they still sleep
in separate beds.

28
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:45,760
Alas,

29
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,320
you mean they sleep apart every night?

30
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:50,760
How come?

31
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:52,800
I think

32
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,680
the sect leader might be upset with him

33
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:59,000
because he's Master Jinse,
which caused a rift.

34
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:03,720
Master Xiao is talented and handsome.

35
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:06,160
It's rare to find such a good match.

36
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:09,560
For the future of Changliu Sect

37
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:12,920
and to ensure the sect lineage,

38
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,360
we need

39
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,720
to figure something out.

40
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:18,640
Yes.

41
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:24,600
Come on,

42
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:28,080
win gold and take it home!

43
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:28,960
Place your bets!

44
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,000
Why did Elder

45
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,840
send us to watch the play?

46
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,480
Who knows?

47
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:34,920
Maybe to inspire you

48
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:37,000
to write a better sequel.

49
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,080
Let's go buy some snacks.

50
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,400
The Cheng's Fruit Shop ahead

51
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,920
sells the sweetest peach

52
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,480
and apricot preserves,

53
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:46,040
and dates.

54
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:46,600
Come.

55
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:49,020
(Fragrant Grains)

56
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:51,000
Isn't this where they sold preserves?

57
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:52,640
It's closed now.

58
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:55,760
The shopkeeper lost his store to us

59
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,360
in a gambling game.

60
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,680
Now the store is ours.

61
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,760
I remember there was also
a bun shop around here.

62
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,360
It's closed too.

63
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:08,080
We own the tavern
and brothel here as well.

64
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,000
But

65
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:12,240
if you're looking for pretty girls,

66
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:14,280
we've got those too.

67
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:15,440
Hey!

68
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:24,040
This town wasn't that prosperous,

69
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:26,520
but at least it had decent shops.

70
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,960
Now it's just shady businesses.

71
00:03:29,330 --> 00:03:29,680
Let's go.

72
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:32,680
I'll take you to the tea house
for some snacks and tea.

73
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,480
Let me check today's performance.

74
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,280
Liang Shanshui and Zhu Mingyu.

75
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,120
Let's go.

76
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:43,720
Alright.

77
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:55,200
These two probably
don't understand love.

78
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,600
We need to find a way to teach them.

79
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,320
How about this?

80
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,920
Tomorrow, I'll send them down

81
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:05,680
to pick up the disciples
from the academy.

82
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:06,840
Alright.

83
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:13,720
Give them these tickets

84
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,400
to catch the play on the way back.

85
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:17,560
Hmm.

86
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:19,960
Liang Zhu, huh?

87
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:21,160
Yes.

88
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:25,760
Isn't that story a bit too tragic?

89
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,400
Well,

90
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,200
it's fine.

91
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:34,880
Thanks.

92
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:45,720
You see, Zhu Mingyu is already engaged,

93
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:48,180
so why did she insist on being
with Liang Shanshui?

94
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,560
The marriage was arranged
by her parents.

95
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:52,800
She had no choice.

96
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:56,280
But couldn't she control her feelings?

97
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,600
This way Liang Shanshui
wouldn't have died.

98
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,800
Feelings aren't that simple.

99
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:04,560
True.

100
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:07,000
Liang Shanshui was too devoted.

101
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:10,120
If it were me, I'd move on

102
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,880
instead of pining away and dying.

103
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:13,920
Such a waste.

104
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,480
I hope you'll be just as sensible

105
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,120
if you face something similar.

106
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,040
Don't jinx me! I won't.

107
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:25,840
Sect leader, come on!

108
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,840
(Qingfeng, disciple of Changliu)
Mingyue got into a fight!

109
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:28,800
What?

110
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,400
Where and with whom?

111
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:32,040
With the gambling hall owner's son.

112
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,560
You scoundrel! You Chang...

113
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,360
Stop!

114
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,640
How dare you bully members
of Changliu Sect!

115
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:39,700
(Mingyue, disciple of Changliu)

116
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:41,600
Hmph!

117
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,960
Since you set a bad example,
they'll follow suit.

118
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:48,040
Why don't you properly discipline
your disciples?

119
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:48,980
Dare to strike others?

120
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,520
Sect leader,

121
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:51,800
he struck first.

122
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:53,840
I couldn't stand it, so I fought back.

123
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:56,380
Mingyue is so well-behaved.
There's no way he started it.

124
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,640
I'll teach you a lesson!

125
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:58,600
Hey.

126
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,800
Using violence won't solve anything.

127
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,360
Mister,

128
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,040
fists can be reckless.

129
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,360
If you were hurt,

130
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:07,160
your son would feel guilty.

131
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,280
Well,

132
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:09,880
when kids fight,

133
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:12,800
you adults shouldn't get involved.

134
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:15,800
Why not have them apologize

135
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,600
to each other and let it go?

136
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,800
- He first!
- She first!

137
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:21,400
How about they play rock-paper-scissors?

138
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,600
The loser apologizes first.

139
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,600
Rock-paper-scissors?

140
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:25,800
Hmph.

141
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,240
I'd rather gamble with dice.

142
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,720
Fine, let's do it.

143
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:32,800
But if I win,
not only will you apologize,

144
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,460
but you'll close the gambling hall
and return it to the fruit sellers.

145
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:37,040
Alright.

146
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,120
But if you lose,

147
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,040
you'll not only kneel and apologize,

148
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:43,120
but Changliu Sect members

149
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,680
will be banned

150
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,440
from this town forever.

151
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,040
Deal.

152
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,040
Let's start.

153
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:58,240
Big or small?

154
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,040
Small.

155
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:02,720
Hmph.

156
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,800
What are you doing?

157
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,840
My father doesn't let me gamble.

158
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,330
If you roll with me, it doesn't count.

159
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,040
I...

160
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:17,280
Hmm.

161
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,280
I'll be fair.

162
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:25,800
I'll go first.

163
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:28,160
Hmph.

164
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:29,520
Five ones!

165
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:33,800
You can't get smaller than that.

166
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,160
Wow.

167
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:51,720
I think this counts as one, right?

168
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,880
Amazing, it should count as one.

169
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:57,800
Nonsense!

170
00:07:59,240 --> 00:07:59,840
You...

171
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:03,960
Now

172
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,800
it's bigger than mine.

173
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,280
Yours is bigger than mine.

174
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:18,800
You dare cheat?

175
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,240
We didn't!

176
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,120
You slammed it yourself. I don't care.

177
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:23,800
You should admit defeat.

178
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,480
Fine.

179
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:30,240
You ganged up to cheat me. Just wait!

180
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,720
Qiang, take my son away.

181
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:33,600
Come.

182
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,280
Oh well,

183
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,800
from now on,

184
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:41,360
my academy will have to close.

185
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:42,360
Why?

186
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:45,000
Enrollment

187
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,560
has been declining.

188
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:49,160
No one wants to study anymore.

189
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:52,680
They all prefer making quick money
through shady ways.

190
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:55,680
Now that we've offended
the local tyrant,

191
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,600
in the future,

192
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,760
my academy will surely close.

193
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,760
Don't worry.
With Changliu Sect's protection,

194
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:05,240
we won't let any scoundrels
run amok here.

195
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,560
Hey, Lipei!

196
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,800
What did you gain

197
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:18,320
from today's play?

198
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:19,560
Gain?

199
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,600
Don't worry, I won't forget about you.

200
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:26,800
No, I mean,

201
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:28,620
didn't you notice anything?

202
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,080
I did.

203
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:33,400
The red bean roll
and jujube cake were too sweet,

204
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,040
but the chestnut cake
was soft and tasty.

205
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:36,800
The rose pastry was also decent,

206
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,080
but the poria cake was just average.

207
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,440
All you think about is food?

208
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:40,920
I'm so mad!

209
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:44,800
Why did she leave?

210
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:46,040
Hey.

211
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,280
You're so good at gambling.

212
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,720
Have you ever thought
of making money from it?

213
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:53,880
My father said

214
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,080
gambling is harmful.

215
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,000
It seems like small stakes,

216
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,160
but once you get hooked,
it's hard to quit.

217
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,680
You either lose everything
or destroy your family.

218
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,760
That's why our sect's rule is

219
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:09,560
anyone caught gambling will be punished
and sometimes kicked out.

220
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,200
(If her father was so righteous,)

221
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,090
(why did he get involved
with the Tianji Sect?)

222
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,800
(Could he have been deceived?)

223
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:20,600
They wasted your tickets today.

224
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,040
The sect leader lost her mother young

225
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:29,880
and her father was focused on
teaching her martial arts.

226
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,240
No one taught her

227
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,760
about matters between men and women.

228
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,560
What should we do then?

229
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,280
It seems

230
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:43,560
we'll need to use

231
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:46,760
stronger measures.

232
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:47,720
Stronger?

233
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:48,920
Yes.

234
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:52,920
Understood.
