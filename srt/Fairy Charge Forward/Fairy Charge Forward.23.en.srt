I hope you'll leave
Zheng Lipei alone from now on.

As for me,

I'll give you what you want.

do you think

18
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,120
you're in a position to bargain?

19
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:26,040
The City Lord must already know

20
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,440
I'm awake.

21
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:31,160
The physicians will soon
arrive at the mansion.

no more Senior Master of Yongzhou,

25
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,320
Xiao Ziqi.

26
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,480
I'm finally home.

27
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:58,880
Welcome back, sect leader.

28
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:10,760
Be careful, Ziqi.

29
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,520
- Greetings, Senior Master.
- Greetings, Senior Master.

30
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,200
Why is Changliu Mountain
full of your people?

31
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,640
When did you send them here?

32
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:29,000
Where are my people?

33
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,480
You'll know in the next few days.

34
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:37,040
Where are Xuefu and Elder now?

35
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,360
Tell me!

36
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,200
You'll know once the plan succeeds.

37
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,280
No need to ask anymore.

38
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:43,920
You...

39
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:46,960
Wait.

40
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,880
Were you approaching me on purpose

41
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:53,600
from the start?

42
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:58,760
You're silent.

43
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:01,600
Does that mean you're admitting it?

44
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,000
Yes.

45
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,400
How could the Senior Master of Yongzhou

46
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,440
have no guards?

47
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,990
How could I just capture you so easily?

48
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,440
It was my plan all along.

49
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,080
Lipei, things are chaotic right now.

50
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:23,400
Let me handle...

51
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,080
Xiao Ziqi,

52
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,800
stop making excuses.

53
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,100
You never intended to come back
to Changliu with me.

54
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,120
You just want to take over the sect
for yourself, don't you?

55
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,000
I'm sorry,

56
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,760
but I have great ambitions.

57
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,240
You have ambitions,

58
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,280
but I have my family to protect.

59
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,680
I won't let anyone take away

60
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,280
what my parents worked
so hard to build in Changliu.

61
00:03:59,080 --> 00:03:59,560
I...

62
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:04,560
Xiao Ziqi,

63
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,320
this is your last chance.

64
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:08,480
Tell me the truth.

65
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:10,720
Zheng Lipei,

66
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,440
I did deceive you.

67
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,560

what's Ziqi doing?

00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,800
He's taken over the entire sect

00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:38,360
and even

104
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:40,000
imprisoned Elder.

105
00:06:40,410 --> 00:06:41,540
I was blind to his character.

106
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:42,780
But enough of that.

107
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:43,960
Right now, our priority

108
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,360
is to find the external disciples

109
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,160
and to reclaim Changliu.

110
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,720

00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,600
you're so brave and wise.

Senior,

113
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,040
you didn't get caught?

00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:00,560
That's great.

115
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,240

Xuefu,

117
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:03,450
it's not that simple.

118
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:11,720
Senior,

119
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:12,880
aren't we on the same side?

What're you doing?

122
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,280
You'll know soon enough.

123
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,360
How could you let her escape?

124
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,960
We had no idea
there was a secret passage.

125
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:30,520
Keep looking.

126
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:31,480
Yes.

127
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,800
Why bother?

128
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,000
Hmph.

129
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,720
I have her.

130
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:45,680
It's you.

131
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:55,680
What do you want?

132
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:57,920
It's simple.

133
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,880
I need you to write a few words

134
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,040
declaring to the world

135
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,560
about your rebellion.

136
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,540
How do you like the knockout incense?

137
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:22,880
Can't move, can you?

138
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:26,200
But I never imagined

139
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:28,640
you'd mean so much to Xiao Ziqi.

140
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:31,990
What do you mean?

141
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,560
Everyone in Yongzhou now knows

142
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:37,000
Sect Leader Zheng Lipei

143
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,920
and Senior Master Xiao Ziqi

144
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:40,880
have conspired in rebellion.

145
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:42,800
You...

146
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,200
Stop struggling.

147
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:48,400
Here's a surprise.

148
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,280
Come on.

149
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:13,960
Let these two

150
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:17,480
star-crossed lovers catch up.

151
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,600
You're unharmed?

152
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,480
Did they hurt you? You injured?

153
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,360
You lied to me again!

154
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:39,000
Xiao Ziqi,

155
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,480
do you really take me for a fool?

156
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:45,240
From the start,

157
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:47,080
I've only ever seen you as my wife.

158
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:50,280
Wife?

159
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,160
We were only using each other.

160
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:55,120
I...

161
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:55,880
What?

162
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,600
After everything,

163
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,920
still no explanation?

164
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:06,590
The fewer people who know
about city matters, the better.

165
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:09,400
Do you even know what you're doing?

166
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:10,760
A rebellion!

167
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,000
Why do you believe them?

168
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,800
Because they used you to threaten me.

169
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,760
When it comes to you,
I can't take risks.

170
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:22,880
I don't understand.

171
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,240
To you,

172
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,360
what am I?

173
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,760
Approaching you was my plan,

174
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:45,980
but falling in love with you wasn't.

175
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:54,880
Rascal!

176
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,760
How dare he commit such a heinous act?

177
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,240
Calm down, My Lord.

178
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:01,760
Ziqi

179
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,600
must've been bewitched
by that woman from Changliu Mountain.

180
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:05,680
Send my order.

181
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,160
Wipe out Changliu Mountain immediately.

182
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,590
My Lord, Changliu Mountain patriots
have reported

183
00:11:18,610 --> 00:11:20,580
they captured
the rebels Zheng Lipei and Xiao...

184
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:21,840
Please instruct.

185
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:23,400
That fast?

186
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:27,960
People of Changliu have long
enjoyed your benevolence.

187
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:31,360
It's no surprise
they wouldn't let rebels

188
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:33,760
destroy the hundred-year legacy
of Yongzhou.

189
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:35,880
They must've

190
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,880
willingly suppressed the rebels.

191
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:39,560
Hmm.

192
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,440
You're benevolent to them,
so they hold you in high regard.

193
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:44,240
These rebels are so ungrateful.

194
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:46,560
They committed such treacherous crime

195
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,760
and deserved nothing
but the scorn and suppress of the people.

196
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:53,440
In that case,

197
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:57,120
have the Changliu Mountain patriots
escort the two rebels to me.

198
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,840
I want to personally reward them.

199
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,440
As you wish, My Lord.
