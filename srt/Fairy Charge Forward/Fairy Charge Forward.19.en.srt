(Give me back my son)
I'll show you what a beating looks like.

10
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:56,840
Accusing me of murder, huh?

11
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:58,360
I'll have to inspect the body first.

12
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:03,240
Don't kill me!

13
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:05,640
Why is it you?

14
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:06,850
Weren't you at the orphanage?

- Liars!
- Liars!

16
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:10,480
(Give me back my son)
They're actors.

17
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:12,040
This little liar wants to extort them!

18
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:13,470
Take them to the authorities.

19
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:13,840
Speak!

20
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:15,000
What's really going on?

21
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:15,600
Speak!

22
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:16,800
Speak up!

23
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:18,120
Hey!

24
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,040
Don't run!

25
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,240
Come back!

26
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:32,760
Ziqi,

27
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,680
I heard from the City Lord
you weren't feeling well.

28
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:36,800
Are you better now?

29
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,390
Thank you for your concern.

30
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:40,400
I'm much better now.

31
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,480
Your hands are still so cold.

32
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:06,800
It seems you've been
practicing the zither diligently.

33
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,600
You even have calluses.

34
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:10,560
Yes,

35
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:14,000
I've practiced for a long time,
but it's still not as good as I'd like.

36
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:19,320
I was hoping you could guide me further.

37
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:26,520
I'm flattered.

38
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,320
Don't get too smug.

39
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:32,960
Wait and see next time!

40
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:34,320
Hmph.

41
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,360
I'll be taking

42
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:48,560
this Shadow Sword.

43
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:54,360
Wow, Ziyi was so amazing just now!

44
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:56,080
I'm not drunk today.

45
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:57,430
I still want to say,

46
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,320
someone shouldn't pretend
to be deeply in love

47
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:04,280
while enjoying the benefits
of having two women.

48
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:07,160
What's gotten into Ziyi?

49
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,000
Why is he speaking so harshly?

50
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:10,840
It seems cold.

51
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:12,650
Please excuse me.

52
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:13,840
I need clothes.

53
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:17,840
(Xiao Ziqi,)

54
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,520
(even seduction doesn't work.)

55
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,760
(One day,)

56
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,760
(I'll make you kneel before me.)

57
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:28,100
(Senior Master Mansion)

58
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:34,320
Master,

59
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,360
the food is getting cold.

60
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,160
Why don't you eat a few bites?

61
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,320
I have no appetite. I don't want to eat.

62
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:41,840
Alas.

63
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,160
Ever since Miss Zheng left,

64
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,160
you haven't eaten properly.

65
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,160
Ah!

66
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,120
Miss Zheng,

67
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,160
you've finally returned.

68
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:51,840
You haven't eaten yet?

69
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,460
I haven't either. Let's eat together.

70
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:54,240
Oh.

71
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:54,720
Sancai,

72
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:55,990
tell the kitchen to heat...

73
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,360
Actually, have them remake.

74
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,440
Got it.

75
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:07,760
Oh, right.

76
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,160
I heard from Ziyi

77
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:11,600
you won first place
at the Dragon Boat Festival.

78
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:13,880
You've seen Ziyi again?

79
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:14,520
Yes.

80
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:17,140
He said he won a famous sword
in the martial arts competition

81
00:04:17,150 --> 00:04:18,000
and wanted to show me.

82
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,080
I heard from Ziyi

83
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:22,600
he plans to give the Shadow Sword he won

84
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,560
to the one he loves.

85
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,080
Is that so?

86
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:28,520
Well, it seems he was rejected
by the girl then.

87
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,200
Why do you say that?

88
00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:32,580
Because he said he wanted
to give it to me.

89
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:35,640
You accepted it?

90
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,280
No.

91
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,880
How could I accept
something so valuable?

92
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:45,440
Hey,

93
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,400
I wonder which girl Ziyi likes.

94
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,240
I don't know. I didn't ask.

95
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:52,600
Oh.

96
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,960
Ziyi is handsome
and skilled in martial arts.

97
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,120
I wonder

98
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,840
what that girl finds lacking.

99
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:00,240
You think so too?

100
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:01,160
Sure.

101
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,000
You see,

102
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,880
Ziyi is kind-hearted

103
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,600
and always stands up for the weak.

104
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,090
We've worked together many times to...

105
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:08,880
To do what?

106
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:11,800
To...

107
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,350
Help elderly women cross the street

108
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,960
and escort lost children home.

109
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:26,960
Is that so?

110
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:28,360
Yes.

111
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:31,600
Oh,

112
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:32,480
by the way.

113
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:36,000
When you asked me

114
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,400
to pretend to be your wife

115
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,720
to help deal with your family,

116
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,160
I thought

117
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:44,240
your family situation was like mine.

118
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:46,560
I though you just wanted to appease them

119
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,880
by finding a random girl.

120
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,400
But I never imagined

121
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:52,040
your situation was completely different.

122
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,600
Your family is beyond ridiculous.

123
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,760
I thought the forced marriages

124
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,560
in our sect were cruel enough.

125
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,400
You see, what if the person set
to inherit the City Lordship

126
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,440
doesn't like Princess?

127
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:05,560
Or what if Princess is
in love with someone else?

128
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:08,280
Wouldn't that just create
another pair of resentful lovers?

129
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:11,160
It's Junior City Lord's responsibility.

130
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:12,440
True.

131
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:16,160
Just like I have to marry
before I can be the sect leader.

132
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,480
But honestly,

133
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,320
I don't want to be City Lord

134
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:22,840
nor marry Princess.

135
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:24,560
Why not?

136
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,640
I'm not as strong
in martial arts as Ziyi,

137
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,800
nor am I as healthy.

138
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I faint when I see blood.

139
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:32,880
If I were to become
the Junior City Lord,

140
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,960
how could I lead troops
into battle to protect the city?

141
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:37,980
How could I help
ease my father's burden?

142
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,080
Hmm,

143
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:41,520
it's definitely hard for you.

144
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:44,080
So, how should I help you?

145
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:46,280
Be serious.

146
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,360
Don't be so casual.

147
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,320
You need to make Ziyi

148
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:51,880
and my father

149
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,880
believe I won't marry anyone but you,

150
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,040
so they'll give up

151
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:57,200
the idea of me marrying Princess.

152
00:06:59,160 --> 00:06:59,960
That...

153
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:01,360
sounds a bit difficult.

154
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:02,520
It is.

155
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:04,720
I already love someone.

156
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,320
I can't marry Princess.

157
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,560
So, I hope

158
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,360
the woman I care for will wait for me

159
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:15,200
until I've sorted out my family matters.

160
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,440
Oh no, Ziyi's been captured!

161
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:32,160
What happened?

162
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,160
Why did you go back?

163
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,000
Didn't we rescue you?

164
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:37,600
And on your hand,

165
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,280
there are

166
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:40,120
more injuries?

167
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:46,080
Those two kept coming back

168
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,400
and we had to chase them off.

169
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,560
They even went to the authorities,

170
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:50,980
accusing us of kidnapping their son.

171
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:51,960
What did they say?

172
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:55,000
They confirmed the couple were indeed
the boy's adoptive parents

173
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,960
and had all the proper paperwork.

174
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58,680
They ordered us to return the boy.

175
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:03,120
When we sent him to the orphanage,

176
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,520
we specifically asked them
to find the boy a good home.

177
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:06,800
But instead,

178
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,720
he was forced back into his old life

179
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:10,720
and his injuries
just kept getting worse.

180
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,180
Doesn't that make you furious?

181
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,080
It's outrageous.

182
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:23,180
(Prison)

183
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:26,100
(Prison)

184
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,360
Let's go check on Ziyi.

185
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:28,040
OK.

186
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:35,040
Tell your brother
to stop being so stubborn.

187
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:38,000
It's not worth it for just a beggar.

188
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:40,400
You're lucky my master allowed you

189
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,760
to pay a ransom and get him released.

190
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,640
If it were anyone else,

191
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,000
he would've been either exiled

192
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:48,920
or given a dozen lashes.

193
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,240
It's just a minor dispute.

194
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:52,560
He didn't hurt anyone,

195
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:53,960
but was injured by them.

196
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,000
And according to my wife,

197
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:58,720
the beggar didn't want
to go with that couple.

198
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:02,120
So my brother didn't kidnap anyone,

199
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:04,120
nor did he demand a ransom.

200
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,680
In fact, my wife had
given them some money.

201
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:09,240
Legally and morally,

202
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,240
there's no reason to charge him.

203
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:13,720
Where does this talk of exile
and lashes come from?

204
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,760
That may be true,

205
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,880
but he's crossed the wrong people.

206
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,840
The beggar gang and the orphanage

207
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,480
are both under
the Wang family's control.

208
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:30,200
They make the children
beg on the streets.

209
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,240
When the boys grow up,
they're sold as laborers,

210
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,090
while the girls are sent to brothels.

211
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:38,480
It's a business.

212
00:09:39,210 --> 00:09:40,360
What kind of people are they?

213
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:41,200
I'll...

214
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:42,360
Come on.

215
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,880
Hey, go home with your brother
and sister-in-law.

216
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:48,960
Don't be so reckless in the future.

217
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:04,440
I'm starving.

218
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,560
I haven't eaten all day.

219
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:07,760
Finally using your brain, huh?

220
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:08,780
You didn't expose yourself

221
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:10,000
and make father know.

222
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,480
I own my actions.

223
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,320
I've been exploring for years

224
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:16,090
and I've never needed father's help.

225
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,080
Besides,

226
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,120
Lipei helped me.

227
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,520
Who asked you to meddle?

228
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,720
Since you've asked her, you involve me.

229
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:24,720
We're a couple,

230
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:25,680
get it?

231
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,040
You're a couple?

232
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,000
I wonder who it was yesterday,

233
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:31,880
holding the Princess's hand and asking,

234
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:36,920
"Your Highness,

235
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:38,800
you've worked so hard on your zither.

236
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,360
Your Highness, your hand..."

237
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,320
Now, eat your meal.

238
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:49,140
Didn't you say you didn't
want to marry her?

239
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,680
Oh, I've already figured out
how to deal with the beggar.

240
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:56,520
We can't send him back
to his adoptive parents.

241
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:59,890
Today is the last day
of the Dragon Boat Festival

242
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,520
and one final event is left

243
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,280
of the "Six Competitions."

244
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,000
Yes.

245
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:05,990
Let's finish this first.

246
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,920
Then I'll make further arrangements.

247
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:11,160
I almost forgot about that!

248
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,400
Good thing I just got out of prison.

249
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:14,840
Go prepare.

250
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:25,920
As they say, a man's words
can be very deceitful.

251
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:28,800
My brother's tongue can
even trick the dead.

252
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:31,320
Be careful around him.

253
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:32,120
Are you going?

254
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:35,380
If you don't go now,
I'll make you the City Lord today.

255
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:37,000
I am.

256
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,600
You two are quite something.

257
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:44,360
Most people fight tooth
and nail for power,

258
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:45,680
but neither of you

259
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,040
wants to be the City Lord.
