9
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:53,280
(There's a rumor going around.)

10
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,800
(Nowadays, there exists a mountain
called Changliu.)

11
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:59,400
(On that mountain, there's a sect
called Changliu Sect.)

12
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:04,520
(The Changliu Sect is nothing
but an evil sect beyond redemption.)

13
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:07,560
(Its newly appointed leader,
Zheng Lipei,)

14
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:12,960
(is an even more ruthless woman
who kills without blinking an eye.)

15
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:17,440
You killer,

16
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:18,240
what do you want?

17
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:31,720
(But no one knows,)

18
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:34,040
(I, Zheng Lipei,
clearly abide by the law)

19
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:35,080
(and am entirely innocent.)

20
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,920
(The only misfortune
I've encountered is...)

21
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,720
(losing money as if cursed.)

22
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,080
This place is truly poor.

23
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,160
Indeed.

24
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:46,600
Exactly.

25
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:46,960
Look.

26
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,000
Take whatever you can.

27
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:48,760
Alright.

28
00:01:56,110 --> 00:01:58,390
The sect leader carries
a curse of financial misfortune.

29
00:01:58,720 --> 00:01:59,400
Alas,

30
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,840
(Liu Yimei, senior disciple of Changliu)
with our fate of losing money,

31
00:02:02,410 --> 00:02:04,960
(Elder of Changliu Sect)
our sect will grow poorer in the future.

32
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:08,120
(Zheng Lipei, Sect Leader of Changliu)
But you can't blame it all on me.

33
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,080
If you must blame someone,

34
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:13,260
blame Master Jinse
who wrote "Chronicles of Changliu."

35
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,840
(Guo Xuefu, disciple of Changliu)
Why else would we be this poor?

36
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,080
In the novel,

37
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,280
he portrayed me
as a monstrous villain

38
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,560
and us as an evil sect
committing wicked deeds.

39
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:22,600
Villagers are terrified
whenever they see us.

40
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,440
How could we possibly earn a living?

41
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,840
Sect leader, don't worry.

42
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,840
Last night, I observed the stars

43
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,480
and gained insight into divine secrets.

44
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,960
Perhaps if you accomplish this task,

45
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:37,520
you can alter your curse
of financial misfortune.

46
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:40,280
What is it? Tell me, Elder.

47
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:44,880
You only need to go down the mountain
to find a suitable husband

48
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:46,160
and this will alter it.

49
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:51,560
(I go down the mountain
in search of a husband,)

50
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:52,800
(but my true purpose)

51
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,080
(is to find that heartless author,
Master Jinse,)

52
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:57,320
(who ruined the reputation
of our Changliu Sect.)

53
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:05,100
(Reward of 50 taels
for bringing Master Jinse)

54
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:07,440
(Reward of 20 taels for useful clues)

55
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,040
A reward of 50 taels of silver.

56
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:09,720
Well,

57
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:12,320
I tell stories written in
Master Jinse's novel every day,

58
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,800
but I don't know him personally.

59
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,680
Coincidentally, my bookshop

60
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:18,840
just received new copies
of "Chronicles of Changliu."

61
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,360
I'll go back and ask the printer

62
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,440
how to contact the author.

63
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,000
Alright.

64
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,200
I happen to be

65
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,880
the illustrator for that novel.

66
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,160
Do you know where he is?

67
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:32,880
It seems I've only interacted
with his servant,

68
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:34,880
so I'm not sure

69
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:35,720
of his whereabouts.

70
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,360
Hey there, sir,

71
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,000
are you trying to do something shady?

72
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Mind your own business

73
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,240
or I'll beat you up!

74
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:58,940
(Xiao Ziqi, Senior Master of Yongzhou)

75
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:03,880
What are you planning
to do in broad daylight?

76
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:08,120
Oh, look! Look at that!

77
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:10,720
Oh my, evil people get
what they deserve.

78
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,000
Serves him right!

79
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,360
Zheng Lipei?

80
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:32,720
(The first person
to open the marriage token is)

81
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,560
(destined to resolve
your financial misfortune)

82
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,480
(and help Changliu
restore its former glory.)

83
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,240
Miss,

84
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:50,880
is this yours?

85
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:02,160
My dear.

86
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:12,680
Lipei,

87
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:16,360
could this be your destined match?

88
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:20,240
And he's so handsome.

89
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,680
Go report to the authorities.

90
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:24,840
I'll talk to that master.

91
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:28,200
You must succeed!

92
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,080
Miss, you've been following me.

93
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,200
Can I help you?

94
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,240
I'm Zheng Lipei.

95
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,800
Yes, I know.

96
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,240
Master, are you married?

97
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,000
Not yet.

98
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,740
The Wang family offers 18 coins

99
00:06:04,810 --> 00:06:05,720
and the Li family nine.

100
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,720
And the enrollment situation
in Yongzhou?

101
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,760
- Ten taels of silver.
- Ten taels.

102
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:11,960
(Changliu Mountain)

103
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:14,120
Hurry up, we're going to miss lunch.

104
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:18,440
Changliu Mountain?

105
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:22,800
Don't worry, we're not some evil sect.

106
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:34,640
Let's go.

107
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:37,640
Come on.

108
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,520
Hurry!

109
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,480
Elder!

110
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:50,960
Elder, bad news!

111
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,680
The sect leader kidnapped someone.

112
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,280
What? Kidnapped?

113
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:55,040
Yes!

114
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:55,800
Well...

115
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:57,640
Oh no.

116
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:02,960
Oh no.

117
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:04,320
Elder.

118
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:05,040
I'm back.

119
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:08,320
Why did you kidnap him?

120
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:09,800
Elder.

121
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:10,800
Huh?

122
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:11,760
Look.

123
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:17,520
Oh.

124
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:18,600
You must be

125
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:22,200
the first one who opened
the marriage token.

126
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,480
That's correct.

127
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,080
Marriage token?

128
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,720
Although you're indeed the destined one,

129
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:32,560
if you want to become the husband

130
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,520
of our Changliu Sect's leader,

131
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,560
you must first pass a series of tests.

132
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,520
Yes.

133
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,560
Husband?

134
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:40,720
