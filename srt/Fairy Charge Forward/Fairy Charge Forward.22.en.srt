Sect Leader Zheng,
what do you mean by that?

11
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:07,080
The Tianji Sect wants
more than my money, right?

12
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:08,680
That's right.

13
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:09,480

Oh no,

17
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:27,520
it's the City Guards.

18
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:28,120
We need to go.

19
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:32,560
Search the area.

20
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:36,800

21
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:37,440
Yes.

22
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:38,480
You two, check over there.

23
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:38,920
Yes.

24
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:42,600
Check here.

25
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:43,160
OK.

26
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:43,880
(Oh no.)

27
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:45,920

Officer,

29
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,440
(Head of City Guards)
I'm just a passerby.

30
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:49,640
Please, allow me to leave.

31
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:50,440
Wait.

32
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:54,320
My Lord,

33
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,920
I have no connection
with the Tianji Sect.

34
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:58,520
I know.

35
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:02,000
I sent Officer Sun to find you today.

36
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:04,080
Otherwise, you'd likely be dead

37
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,200
by their hands.

38
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,600
(Officer Sun was looking for me?)

39
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,360
Many thanks to you for saving my life.

40
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,360
Now you owe me a debt.

41
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,800
Why don't you repay me now?

42
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,800
Leave the Senior Master Mansion.

43
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:17,200
Return to Changliu Mountain.

44
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:19,920
Don't see Ziqi again.

45
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,160
I could agree to anything else,

46
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:28,800
but not this.

47
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:30,520
Why not?

48
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:34,240
How long do you plan to ensnare Ziqi?

49
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:36,920
You've made him ignore the Princess

50
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:38,000
for someone like you,

51
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,400
a savage woman

52
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,800

00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,080
Take it and leave.

56
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:55,000
Once Ziqi marries Princess,

57
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,520
I'll even

58
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,320
open a trade route

59
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,760
to help you revive Changliu Mountain.

60
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:04,000
Thank you for the offer,

61
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,360
but I'll revive

62
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,760
Changliu myself

63
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,640
without relying on others.

64
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,140
Stubborn and unyielding!

65
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,960
If there's nothing else,

66
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,360
I'll take my leave.

67
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,560
I hear rumors

68
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,440
a divine beast has been spotted

69
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,560
on the southern slope
of Changliu Mountain.

70
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,480
Spreading such nonsense

71
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,000
deserves to be punished.

72
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:26,680
Who knows

73
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:29,480
where the mastermind
behind these rumors has fled?

74
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:31,720
And those ignorant villagers

75
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:33,480
who dared defy me,

76
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,160
do they still hope to escape justice?

77
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,360
When I catch them,

78
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:39,160
should I have
their entire family executed

79
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:41,680
or

80
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,320
simply exile them to Lingnan?

81
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:54,840
What spell has Zheng Lipei cast

82
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,720
to enchant my son so completely?

83
00:03:58,720 --> 00:03:59,560
Aunt,

84
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:03,920
please calm down.

85
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,840
I might have a plan

86
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,320
to ease your concerns.

87
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,160
(The City Lord seems determined
to make me leave.)

88
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,160
(Defying him would mean certain death.)

89
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:32,000
(But how can I explain this to him?)

90
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,480
I heard the City Lord
summoned you this morning.

91
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,160
What did he say?

92
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:43,960
He knows I was poisoned
at Changliu Mountain

93
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,880
and had the physicians prepare

94
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,720
tonics to help me recover.

95
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,000
Don't worry.

96
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,400
Master, here's your medicine.

97
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:53,440
Thank you.

98
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,400
I'll go prepare it for you.

99
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,240
Let the servants do it.

100
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:01,160
I'll go.

101
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,320
(Let me)

102
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,920
(do this one last thing for you.)

103
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:22,600
Madam,

104
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:23,880
bad news!

105
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,720
A squad of soldiers
is here to arrest you.

106
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:27,280
Arrest me?

107
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:29,640
Are you Zheng Lipei?

108
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:31,520
Yes.

109
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,720
Take her away! Put her in prison.

110
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:48,600
Witch!

111
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,280
Do you know your crime?

112
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:53,200
I don't know
what crime I've committed.

113
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:54,720
But I'm sure

114
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,120
you've already made one up.

115
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,440
Why ask me?

116
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,080
You murdered an important figure

117
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:02,240
and you remain unrepentant!

118
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,800
You'd better sign this confession

119
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,960
and save yourself some pain.

120
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:12,240
To condemn me,
you can always trump up a charge.

121
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:13,560
Why should I sign it?

122
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:27,280
This prison is quite well-equipped.

123
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:14,720
Could you stop giving me spoiled food?

124
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,720
I don't respond well to force.

125
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,000
If you give me something tasty,

126
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,200
maybe I'll confess.

127
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,160
It's me.

128
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:24,200
Why are you here?

129
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,080
Savior.

130
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,200
You're truly my savior.

131
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:41,560
Be careful!

132
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,640
So, tell me,

133
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:46,760
what crime have I committed?

134
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:48,640
You don't know?

135
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,600
They said

136
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,880
you poisoned Ziqi's medicine.

137
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:54,760
Poisoned?

138
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:55,400
Yes.

139
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,080
What kind of logic is that?

140
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,160
I'd never poison...

141
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,360
Ziqi's been poisoned?

142
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,360
How is he? Was the poison cured?

143
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:11,200
The physicians said
there's nothing they can do.

144
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:23,680
Close the door.

145
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:27,140
(Prison)

146
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,320
Please let this go.

147
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,240
Why did you let them go?

148
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:53,440
Do you think I'll wait

149
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,000
for a formal trial?

150
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,360
Notify the City Guards,

151
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,800
the criminal Zheng Lipei has escaped.

152
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,400
She's highly skilled

153
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:03,760

154
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,240
If anyone sees her,

155
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:08,560
kill her on sight.

156
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,400
Brilliant idea.

159
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:23,720
I didn't poison him.

160
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:24,400
I know.

161
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,600
Before Master passed out, he told me

162
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:29,680
to believe no one but you.

163
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,160
Give me some time.

164
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:32,120
I'll detoxify Ziqi.

165
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,080
Don't let anyone in.

166
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,800
Otherwise, both he
and I'll be in danger.
