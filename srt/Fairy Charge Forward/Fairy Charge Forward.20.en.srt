00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:50,000
Miss Zheng,

10
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,640
would you care to have a drink with me?

11
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:53,720
No, thank you.

12
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,520
Don't be ungrateful.

13
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,760
You're just a concubine with no status
and you dare refuse me?

14
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:09,080
If you can get this wine out,

15
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,440
maybe I'll have a drink with you.

16
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:15,520
You're toying with me?

17
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:16,360
Yes, I am.

18
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,360
So what?

19
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Miss Zheng,

20
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,760
why are you sitting so far away?

21
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,280
Didn't you agree to sit with me?

22
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:26,440
Oh, right.

23
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:27,640
Sorry about that, Wang Qian.

24
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:29,760
We'll go chat for a bit.

25
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,000
Please help yourself.

26
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:41,440
Sit.

27
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,160
My Lord, please draw the lot

28
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,600
for today's competition.

29
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,440
Today's competition

30
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:25,320
is hunting.

31
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,680
Why does it have to be hunting?

32
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,160
Now how am I supposed to lose?

33
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,720
If you lose in hunting,

34
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:38,200
you'll probably be punished
by father with kneeling.

35
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,680
Stop gloating.

36
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:41,960
Ancestors of Yongzhou

37
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,160
were skilled in hunting.

38
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:44,520
Though

39
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,680
the granaries are full now,

40
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:46,880
their skills

41
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,320
in horse riding, archery,

42
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:49,520
hunting, fishing

43
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,280
and cutting down trees mustn't be lost.

44
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,280
In this competition

45
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:55,960
at the western outskirts,

46
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:00,000
you must show the full spirit
of us Yongzhou men.

47
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,280
I'll await good news

48
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:05,000
from you all.

49
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,560
This time,

50
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,160
you must catch many preys.

51
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:22,840
We're waiting for you
to add to our dinner,

52
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,840
so don't disappoint us.

53
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,320
Every year
during the Dragon Boat Festival,

54
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,480
the City Lord holds
a three-day competition

55
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:37,440
to select the most talented
and heroic men of Yongzhou.

56
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:40,680
We've already had the calligraphy
and martial arts competitions.

57
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:44,400
Master Ziqi and Master Ziyi
won respectively.

58
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,920
I wonder who'll win today's
hunting competition.

59
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:50,160
It'll probably be Ziyi.

60
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:52,360
Don't you want Master Ziqi to win?

61
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,400
Winning the competition

62
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,260
means you can make a request
to the City Lord.

63
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:58,520
Many are waiting for this chance

64
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:01,040
to ask for marriage and secure a match.

65
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,840
That might be hard for him.

66
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,480
Summer hunting is quite different
from winter hunting.

67
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,600
It's done in the forests.

68
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:14,040
Besides close-range hunting
and trapping,

69
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,280
there are other methods.

70
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,600
Master Ziqi could still win.

71
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:32,280
Everyone,

72
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,520
we'll meet back here in four hours.

73
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:35,280
By then,

74
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,760
whoever has the most prey

75
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,800
will be the winner.

76
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:39,720
Please.

77
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:48,440
Can't you take this seriously?

78
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:50,040
Mind your own business.

79
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:50,600
You...

80
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,800
Have you prepared everything?

81
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:53,880
Don't worry.

82
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,300
They're already set in the woods.

83
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:56,360
Go get them yourself.

84
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,120
Are you...

85
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,160
Are you here for a leisurely stroll?

86
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:07,980
Can't you at least pretend
to be hunting?

87
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,200
I'm not good at this to begin with.

88
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:11,490
Why are you following me?

89
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,120
Go catch more prey.

90
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,880
Why are you two being so modest?

91
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:17,840
You already know you can't beat me?

92
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:21,800
I've already decided

93
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,440
what to ask the City Lord after I win.

94
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:26,760
How about this?

95
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,000
Just give me

96
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,680
your beautiful concubine.

97
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:31,680
What do you think?

98
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:36,520
I can't wait

99
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,360
to have

100
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:41,120
Miss Zheng dance just for me.

101
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,400
Keep dreaming.

102
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:47,880
Hmph.

103
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,960
(Was all the lots hunting?)

104
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,520
(They must've known father
would only pick one)

105
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,000
(and confirmed it in advance.)

106
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:00,760
Cheating?

107
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,320
(How bold.)

108
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,120
He was openly insulting you.

109
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,680
What are you mumbling about?

110
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,760
Oh, I'll make Lipei dance for me alone.

111
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:10,200
You're just going to watch him boast?

112
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,480
What if he really asks father for Lipei?

113
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,520
Would you give her to him?

114
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,440
Mind your own business.

115
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:25,880
I'm sure

116
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:27,680
you already know my father's purpose

117
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,160
for sending me to Yongzhou this time.

118
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:33,120
You're tasked with the responsibility
of peace between two cities.

119
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,880
It's truly admirable

120
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:36,440
you came to Yongzhou alone.

121
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,080
I thought you'd be jealous of me

122
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:40,640
because of Master Ziqi,

123
00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:42,060
but who knew...

124
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,480
From now on,

125
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:45,560
you'll be my best friend in Yongzhou.

126
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:47,800
Well,

127
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,760
Your Highness, you're a princess

128
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,880
and I'm just a commoner.

129
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:54,960
No need to worry.

130
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,200
I don't mind.

131
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,760
Once I marry Master Ziqi,

132
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:59,400
we can be together every day.

133
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:00,760
By that time,

134
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:03,360
you and I will both be his wives.

135
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,640
The three of us will live
in perfect harmony.

136
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:06,760
Wouldn't that be wonderful?

137
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:40,560
(It seems the prey is nearby.)

138
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,200
The third tree on the right.

139
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:07,720
It's here.

140
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:12,840
Today,

141
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,280
victory will be mine!

142
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:28,840
I'm working so hard over there

143
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:30,580
while you're here reading?

144
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:31,320
Ah,

145
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,040
good work.

146
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,040
You've caught a lot.

147
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,320
You're sure to win today.

148
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,320
When I win,

149
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,000
I'll ask father to send Lipei
back to Changliu Mountain.

150
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,400
My prey is caught!

151
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,280
Help!

152
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:00,000
Someone, help me!

153
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:04,720
Help!

154
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,080
You...

155
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:07,760
Ziyi,

156
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:08,760
a two-legged pig.

157
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:11,800
Xiao Ziqi,

158
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,160
how dare you ambush me!

159
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:18,120
Afterwards, I'll report you to the City Lord

160
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:20,120
for ambushing a competitor
and stealing my prey.

161
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:20,760
Oh, right.

162
00:10:21,210 --> 00:10:23,080
You can also report
your bribery of the official,

163
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,200
manipulation of the lots

164
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:27,200
and pre-planted prey.

165
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:29,040
How did you know?

166
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,320
Next time, don't covet things

167
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,520
that don't belong to you.

168
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,240
