Xiao Ziqi.

11
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:48,960
Wake up.

12
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:50,880
There are assassins!

13
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:59,440
Father...

14
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:06,000
Who are you calling?

15
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,920
How did these two appear out of nowhere?

16
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:19,280
What do we do?

17
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:20,240
Should we run?

18
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:21,480
Don't panic.

19
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,040
Lipei didn't recognize us.

20
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:26,000
Let's just act normal and see.

21
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:27,440
Let's go.

22
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:38,400
They must have a lot of guts
to try and ambush us Changliu Sect.

23
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:42,280
Did you have some debts

24
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:44,080
you forgot to pay?

25
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,960
Those two people in black
were highly skilled.

26
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:51,520
If debt collectors could afford
assassins like them,

27
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,080
hmph,

28
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,000
they wouldn't care about our debt.

29
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:01,440
Could they be robbers?

30
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:06,120
Everyone knows

31
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,720
our Changliu Sect is dirt poor.

32
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,520
Who would bother robbing us?

33
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,280
Or maybe they're here for the beauty.

34
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:24,040
Well...

35
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:25,520
Lipei,

36
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:28,360
the only beauty worth stealing

37
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,880
around here is probably your husband.

38
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,160
Come to think of it,

39
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:38,640
they really didn't go anywhere else,

40
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,680
but headed straight for you.

41
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:43,800
You...

42
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,000
I...

43
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,000
They were indeed after me.

44
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,600
Here's the thing.

45
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Earlier, I wrote a story

46
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,040
that exposed the dark secret
in Shaozhou.

47
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:55,240
Outwardly, they claim to lead Shaozhou
to supremacy in the Central Plains.

48
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,520
But inside, they run
an assassin organization

49
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,320
that secretly eliminates anyone

50
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,200
who opposes

51
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:02,600
or defies them.

52
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,160
No wonder.

53
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:11,800
You've uncovered a major conspiracy
of the assassins.

54
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,400
You're amazing.

55
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,140
But I've dragged you into this mess.

56
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,280
I feel guilty about it.

57
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:22,560
Don't worry.

58
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:24,360
Changliu Sect will protect you.

59
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,440
They won't lay a finger on you.

60
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:27,920
Master, just stay here

61
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,840
and finish writing the sequel.

62
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,440
We may be down on our luck,

63
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,760
but we won't let scoundrels

64
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:34,280
trample over us.

65
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
From now on, we'll sleep together.

66
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:52,840
Why?

67
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:56,360
I need to be close to you
to protect you at all times

68
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,920
and keep those assassins at bay.

69
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,040

To bathe and change.

77
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:08,920
I'll go with you.

78
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:11,160
No, no need...

79
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:27,520
Where?

80

Where are they?

81
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,280
There was a rat that just ran past.

82
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:32,240
A rat?

83
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,040
Yes.

84
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:34,800
It's gone now.

85
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,520

Hello.

98
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:37,480
Check this out.

99
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,840
Hi, check this out.

100
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:41,800
Hi there.

101
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:44,240
Lipei, do you think
we can find anyone?

102
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:45,920
We'll do our best.

103
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,800
That man is so handsome.

104
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,600
His hands are so beautiful.

105
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:54,680
So charming.

106
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,160
No one's interested.

107
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,480
Yes, what do we do?

108
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,160
The music is lovely.

109
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,840
He's so good-looking.

110
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:04,800
What are you looking at?

111
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,600
Hey, look at how good-looking he is.

112
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:08,600
Yes.

113
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,880
Maybe we should learn too.

114
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,240
It's rare for an academy to accept

115
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:15,280
people from all walks of life.

116
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,040
Why would people like us

117
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:19,680
need to go to the academy?

118
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:20,280
Lovely music.

119
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:21,800
As they say, knowledge brings grace.

120
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:23,560
You two didn't choose

121
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,600
to end up in this line

122
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:26,680
of work, right?

123
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,240
Likely, your past led you here.

124
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,800
If you learn some poetry

125
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:33,880
or pick up a skill

126
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,600
at this academy,

127
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:37,440
you could change your fate.

128
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:39,800
How much does it cost?

129
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:41,720
The tuition

130
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,600
is covered by the Changliu Sect.

131
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,240
If you're interested,
you can sign up with Sir Cheng.

132
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:52,360
- I'm in!
- Count me in!

133
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,720
I don't have any money. Do you have any?

134
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,000
Calm down.

135
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,280
Put it down.

136
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,040
Put it down.

137
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,680
To learn and practice what is learned,

138
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:10,800
isn't it a pleasure?

139
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:13,800
To learn and practice what is learned,

140
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,200
isn't it a pleasure?

141
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,440
To have friends come from afar,

142
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,440
isn't it a joy?

143
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:21,400
To have friends come from afar,

144
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:23,040
isn't it a joy?

145
00:09:23,050 --> 00:09:24,680
To remain calm
despite being unrecognized,

146
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:26,080
isn't it a mark of a true gentleman?

147
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:30,080
A man who's serious
about his work is truly attractive.

148
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,240
My money was well spent.

149
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,160
Once again.

150
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:34,440
When did you spend any money?

151
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,360
Didn't your husband pay for everything?

152
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,400
He said he'd use all the money
he earned from his novel

153
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:42,640
to help the townsfolk of Qingliang Town.

154
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,160
To have friends come from afar,

155
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,920
isn't it a joy?

156
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,880
To remain calm

00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:56,400
isn't it a mark of a true gentleman?

158
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,640
To learn...

159
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:07,560
Where are we supposed
to find that much money?

160
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,800
Maybe we should just run

161
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:12,960
before anyone notices.

162
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,840
I heard you're in need of money.

163
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:23,880
