Miss Zheng.

00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:26,640
Please understand.

33
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,720
- Hey, it wasn't me.
- Don't run.

34
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:35,720
You still dare to run?

35
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:36,600
Stop right there.

36
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,520
It wasn't me.

37
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:38,640
You drugged me, didn't you?

38
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:39,160
Elder!

39
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:39,960
You've become bold!

40
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:41,040
It was Elder

41
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,400
who told me to use strong measures.

42
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,520
I told you to think of a strong measure,

43
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:46,960
not to drug them!

44
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:51,280
I meant for you to come up
with a better idea.

45
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:54,000
Ah, such a mistake.

46
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,680
Master Xiao,

47
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,320
please don't hold it against us.

48
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:00,040
Xuefu doesn't know much.

49
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:02,760
When I mentioned "something strong",
they gave me this.

50
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:03,960
You...

51
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:05,880
Hey,

52
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,680
you two are already married.

53
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:10,580
Why are you still sleeping
in separate beds?

54
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,960
Hey, don't run!

55
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:13,520
Hey, you...

56
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:14,600
Elder,

57
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:17,400
last night I reviewed
the accounts again.

58
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:21,040
I found besides the rent
from land down the mountain

59
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:23,280
and from the shops in town,

60
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,840
there are some vacant houses
in Qingliang Town

61
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:28,360
that could be used for business

62
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,600
to earn some extra income.

63
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:35,560
Master Xiao, we should
really discuss this carefully.

64
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:36,920
Let's go and study the accounts.

65
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,480
OK.

66
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:49,020
(Yongzhou)

67
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,400
Your Highness, the assassins are ready.

68
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,080
They're just waiting for your command.

69
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,760
If we don't take this chance
to eliminate Xiao Ziqi,

70
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,760
it'll be harder to find another

71
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,440
once he returns to Yongzhou.

72
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:14,560
This time, I'll meet him personally.

73
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:24,190
(This academy,
located in the west of Qingliang Town,)

74
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,400
(has been teaching classics,
literature and maths,)

75
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,080
(as well as other subjects.)

76
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,880
(The fees are minimal,)

77
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,000
(and anyone,)

78
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,960
(regardless of distance or wealth,)

79
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,480
(is welcome to attend.)

80
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,200
(All we ask)

81
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:40,240
(is students strive to succeed)

82
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:41,990
(and not disappoint our shared hopes.)

83
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:44,480
(Changliu Academy, West Qingliang Town.)

84
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:48,560
All done.

85
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:52,840
I'll distribute these in town tomorrow.

86
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,890
I'm sure we'll help Sir Cheng
attract many students.

87
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:58,520
So, these are the goods
you've collected?

88
00:07:58,520 --> 00:07:59,280
Yes.

89
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,040
This one,

90
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:04,840
it's wild honey collected
from the cliffside, very sweet.

91
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,040
Try some.

92
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:06,840
Honey?

93
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:07,440
Yes.

94
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,040
Sweet, isn't it?

95
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:15,800
Yes.

96
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:19,480
Are you really planning
to help us do business?

97
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,160
I thought

98
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,200
you were just trying to placate Elder.

99
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:26,760
It's my fault your reputation
was damaged.

100
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:30,200
I'm just trying to make amends.

101
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,580
And the townsfolk of Qingliang Town

102
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,860
has suffered
because of Changliu Mountain.

103
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:35,580
Their lives are getting worse
by the day.

104
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,520
I feel I should
take some responsibility.

105
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:39,640
Actually, it's not really your fault.

106
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:43,040
The main issue is
we don't belong to either Shaozhou

107
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:43,920
or Yongzhou,

108
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:46,400
so naturally, bandits gather here.

109
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,880
It's time for a change.

110
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:55,080
What's this?

111
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:56,640
Monkey Wine.

112
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,440
The monkeys in the mountains

113
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:01,200
often bring fruit to tree hollows
or rock crevices for the winter.

114
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,080
Over time, they forget about it

115
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,800
and the fruit ferments into wine.

116
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:07,240
Here, let me pour you some.

117
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:08,720
This wine is excellent.

118
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:10,280
Is it strong?

119
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:12,040
Just try it.

120
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:18,600
How is it?

121
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:22,920
Indeed tasty.

122
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:24,400
Let me pour you more.

123
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,780
(Tonight's going to be a wild one.)

124
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,040
Senior,

125
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,040
are we really doing this?

126
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:41,520
If we don't, won't our secret
of selling the shop be exposed?

127
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:44,080
Let's go.

128
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,600

129
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,920
