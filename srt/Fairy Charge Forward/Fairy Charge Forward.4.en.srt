00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:56,360
How did you know he was bluffing?

10
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:58,510
What's wrong?

11
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,280
Although he tried to conceal it,

12
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:04,640
his moves were
somewhat similar to yours.

13
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:08,600
He avoided your vital points
several times

14
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:10,320
and try not to hurt you.

15
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,680
How come I didn't notice that?

16
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:15,520
Your shoes and his
have the same pattern,

17
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:18,120
which should be a special design
of your Changliu Sect.

18
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,480
Great, they even tricked me.

19
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:25,600
That was the real test for your husband.

20
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,320
And you still played along?

21
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:33,320
Hmm.

22
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:34,920
It's done already?

23
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:09,800
Oh well,

24
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:14,200
as expected from the husband
chosen by our sect leader.

25
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,440
What a man of great intellect.

26
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:18,800
You passed the test so quickly.

27
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,400
Why didn't you tell me in advance?

28
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,000
Well.

29
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:23,440
The auspicious hour has arrived.

30
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:24,360
Come on, up here.

31
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:27,440
Come.

32
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,800
Wait.

33
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:31,800
What's this?

34
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:32,320
Wedding veil.

35
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,720
Why should I wear a wedding veil?

36
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,560
Oh, just put it on already.

37
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,160
I won't! Take it off. What are you doing?

38
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,800
Hurry, don't miss the auspicious hour.

39
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,200
Why does a man wear a wedding veil?

40
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,360
Why can't a man wear one?

41
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,160
Hold still.

42
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:42,560
Great.

43
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,720
Put it on.

44
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:57,840
Report!

45
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:00,360
Bad news!

46
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,120
Bad news, sect leader.

47
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,680
The debt collectors are here again.

48
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:50,560
Achoo.

49
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:56,640
It's my wedding day.

50
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,290
Hall Master, are you here
to give a gift?

51
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,720
Have you gathered the payment?

52
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,840
It's only been a few days.

53
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,640
How could I possibly
find 800 taels of gold?

54
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,160
Then from today on,

55
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:11,200
this place belongs to our Tianji Sect.

56
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,120
Dream on! Hand me my sword.

57
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:15,880
You...

58
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,480
Sect leader Zheng, will you fight?

59
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:23,880
Hall Master, why force us like this?

60
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:26,440
Marriage is a major event.

61
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,080
According to Yongzhou law,

62
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,880
the newlyweds take precedence.

63
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:32,680
Now you're disrupting
the wedding ceremony,

64
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,680
which goes against public order

65
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:35,400
and decency.

66
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,280
According to Yongzhou law?

67
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,160
As far as I know,

68
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,920
Changliu Mountain is neutral territory.

69
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,280
When did it belong to Yongzhou?

70
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:45,320
We don't belong to either.

71
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,320
But is this how

72
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,640
Shaozhou treats newlyweds?

73
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:51,480
Of course not.

74
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:52,840
Then please leave,

75
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:55,000
or I'll have to report this
to the authorities.

76
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:56,840
Fine.

77
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:59,440
Since it's Sect Leader Zheng's
wedding day,

78
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:01,760
we won't discuss the debt today.

79
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:05,320
But I must still collect some interest.

80
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:16,120
Hey! No, that's our stuff!

81
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,120
No, you can't take that!

82
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,200
Put it down!

83
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:22,920
Hey!

84
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:23,680
Give it back!

85
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:24,920
Put it down!

86
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:25,920
Give it back!

87
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,360
Hey!

88
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,680
You, put it down!

89
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,000
Put it down!

90
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,280
Lipei.

91
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,120
I got it back.

92
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:55,680
Lipei...

93
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,600
Lipei, are you alright?

94
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:05,880
Have they left?

95
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:08,640
Lipei,

96
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,520
your curse of misfortunate

97
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,920
is making us lose everything.

98
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,320
It's not entirely my fault.

99
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:19,280
Blame that Master Jinse.

100
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:20,440
Ah,

101
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:23,480
luckily the auspicious hour
hasn't passed.

102
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:26,120
But the wedding hall is a mess now.

103
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:28,520
Alas,

104
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,640
I'm an incompetent leader.

105
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,560
It's OK.

106
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,200
As long as there's affection,

107
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:36,120
who cares about the formalities?

108
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:56,000
Come on, don't miss the auspicious hour.

109
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:57,320
Alright.

110
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:01,920
From now on,

111
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:04,400
whether in poverty or hardship,

112
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:07,120
whether in debt or repayment,

113
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:11,160
do you vow to spend the rest
of your life with Zheng Lipei?

114
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:18,480
Yes.

115
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:25,760
Master, take it off too.

116
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,320
This wedding robe is suffocating.

117
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,440
I only agreed to this marriage
as a temporary measure.

118
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:39,990
Don't push your luck.

119
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,120
I thought your outfit was cumbersome

120
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,320
and wanted to help.

121
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:47,200
Forget it.

122
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:48,880
I don't want to explain.

123
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,880
I know you all think I'm evil,

124
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:54,720
but I'd never force anyone.

125
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:58,280
Kidnapping you was just to borrow
your good fortune for the wedding.

126
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:00,320
If you don't want to marry me,

127
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:02,320
you're free to go after tonight.

128
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:03,640
Really?

129
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:07,960
Tomorrow, we'll use the excuse
of visiting your parents.

130
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:11,320
I promise we'll part ways as soon as
we go down the mountain.

131
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,080
Alright.

132
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:14,880
Who's there?

133
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:15,880
Careful, assassin!

134
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:26,880
Hey, keep your voice down.

135
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:29,080
Be quiet.

136
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:29,640
Hey.

137
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:30,760
Hey, don't push me.

138
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:31,960
Stop pushing me.

139
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:32,520
Ouch.

140
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:35,760
It's gone quiet.

141
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:44,880
Xuefu,

142
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,960
why are you eavesdropping here?

143
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,920
Oh, these are gifts
from the other disciples.

144
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,080
And these,

145
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,520
I bought...I sewed them myself.

146
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:05,080
Don't they look like you and him?

147
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:08,600
Huh?

148
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,280
Here, it's for you.

149
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:23,280
It really does look like you.

150
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,960
But Xuefu is always insensitive.

151
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:31,400
Why give something
that's neither edible nor useful?

152
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,620
They do make a good pair.
