=Episode 12=

9
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:52,320
I heard from them

10
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:55,200
(Changliu Mountain)
you married their sect leader?

11
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:58,000
It's just a temporary measure,
don't take it seriously.

12
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,360
Oh, that's good.

13
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:01,600
I was just worried
if the City Lord found out...

14
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:02,520
What if he does?

15
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:04,680
The affection between a man and a woman

16
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:06,760
is the most pure
and beautiful thing in this world.

17
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:07,890
Why fear others' words?

18
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:10,240
Master, you aren't really...

19
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:13,000
It's not like that.

20
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:13,600
Oh.

21
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:15,680
I can't meddle in others' affairs,

22
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:18,640
but when it comes to your marriage,
we should be careful.

23
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,560
You must know what the City Lord meant

24
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,600
by sending you
to meet the Princess, right?

25
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:27,680
If I'm not there,

26
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:29,720
the City Lord
will send Ziyi to meet her.

27
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:33,120
The Lady has always wanted
to match Ziyi with the Princess.

28
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:35,200
I'm happy to see that.

29
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:38,360
In that case, everyone'll be happy.

30
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,280
But Master Ziyi

31
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,800
is already here looking for you.

32
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:44,200
How did he know?

33
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:47,720
I told him

34
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,760
because I saw the code
you left in your novel

35
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:52,000
and thought you were at risk.

36
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:52,800
I got worried and...

37
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,480
Master Ziyi set off before me,

38
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,200
but why isn't he here yet?

39
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:01,600
Maybe he got lost.

40
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:03,040
Huh?

41
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:04,040
Hey!

42
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:14,220
(Xiao Ziyi, Second Master of Yongzhou)

43
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,680
This lousy map,

44
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,360
is it even accurate?

45
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,520
Even if I die today,

46
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:42,920
I won't let you take down a single brick
of the temple.

47
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:52,520
Then we'll just tear you down
along with the temple.

48
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:57,720
You all bully an old woman?

49
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:58,240
How shameful!

50
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,920
Where did this brat come from? Die!

51
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,720
Ganging up on an elderly woman?

52
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:13,440
Truly shameless.

53
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,830
Another one who doesn't know better?

54
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:15,560
All of you!

55
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:16,720
Get them!

56
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:56,440
(This young woman's moves
aren't only exquisite)

57
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,840
(but also align with mine.)

58
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,520
(Could this be fate?)

59
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,280
Old woman,

60
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,440
you're lucky today.

61
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:05,280
Let's go.

62
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,600
Thank you both for saving me.

63
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:14,000
(Granny Gongsun, villager)
My home is just up this hill.

64
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,800
If you don't mind,

65
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:20,040
you can come to my house
to wash your faces

66
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:21,480
and have a rest before you leave.

67
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,600
I'm Xiao Ziyi. May I have your name?

68
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,840
I'm Zheng Lipei from the Changliu Sect.

69
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,200
Do you live on this mountain?

70
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:33,200
Yes.

71
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,360
Have you recently met someone

72
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,400
about my height

73
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,800
but a bit shorter?

74
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,760
He looks somewhat

75
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,200
like me but

76
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,080
not as handsome.

77
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,960
He's not very skilled,

78
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,640
the type who dare not kill at all.

79
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,400
He's always quoting Confucius,

80
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,320
a real bookworm.

81
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:54,800
A bookworm?

82
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,200
Have you seen this person?

83
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:09,000
Does this person have
any distinctive traits?

84
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,640
He doesn't like sweet things.

85
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,960
Actually, he doesn't dislike sweets.

86
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:29,520
He has a severe cleanliness obsession

87
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,640
and hates physical contact with others.

88
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,360
If someone touches his hands,

89
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,160
he has to wash them three times.

90
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,360
Cleanliness obsession?

91
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:50,700
I don't think I know the one
you're looking for.

92
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:55,200
Ah, coming.

93
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,400
Sorry for the wait.

94
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:00,800
Here.

95
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,160
Have a drink.

96
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,160
Granny,

97
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:06,800
why did those people want
to harm you earlier?

98
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:08,840
Before,

99
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:12,040
someone saw the divine beast
Chenghuang on the mountain

100
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,680
and reported it to the City Lord.

101
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,560
The City Lord then sent people
to build this temple.

102
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,680
Granny Gongsun!

103
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:21,400
Bad news!

104
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,120
Those people have returned

105
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:24,400
with a squad of soldiers.

106
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,640
Don't go.

107
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:27,120
Granny Gongsun, you need to run.

108
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,660
They said you fabricated
the auspicious signs and spread rumors,

109
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,760
and they're going to arrest you.

110
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,760
I'll take responsibility for my actions.

111
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:35,960
Let them come after me.

112
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:38,880
I'll confront them.

113
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,740
If necessary,
we'll settle this with force.

114
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:41,920
Granny,

115
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,320
you should hide in the mountain.

116
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,640
We'll think of a way
to distract the soldiers.

117
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:48,560
You should hide in the woods
and don't come out until it's safe.

118
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,240
Let's go.

119
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,080
You two be careful.

120
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,840
This could be very dangerous.

121
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:56,200
If there's danger,

122
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:57,280
don't worry about me.

123
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:58,680
Just run.

124
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,000
Trying to run?

125
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:16,480
Tie her up.

126
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,200
Don't move.

127
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:26,240
Let's see who fell into

128
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,240
such a simple trap.

129
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:28,960
How dare you!

130
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,120
Are you trying to rebel?

131
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:32,000
Yes, we're bandits

132
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,860
and we're here to beat you,
scoundrel soldiers.

133
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,600
Granny Gongsun and the villagers

134
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,400
should be safe now.

135
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:46,520
It's a shame the village was destroyed.

136
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,320
I'll find a place to resettle them.

137
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,120
I have urgent matters,
so I can't go with you.

138
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:55,590
Here's some money.

139
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:56,990
Please give it to Granny Gongsun.

140
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,120
Consider it done.

141
00:07:58,540 --> 00:07:58,920
Alright.

142
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:00,280
Take care on your journey.

143
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:00,800
OK.

144
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,280
I got this dirty.

145
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,680
I'll wash it when I return

146
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:05,340
and bring it back
when I visit you again.

147
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,000
(I've long suspected)

148
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,520
(there's a force in the city)

149
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:26,200
(secretly colluding with Shaozhou.)

150
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:27,760
(You must root it out)

151
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,640
(as soon as you return.)

152
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:33,560
(Censor Li is a man of integrity.)

153
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:36,880
(If you need help in the city,
you can consult him.)

154
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:40,880
Master, I inquired about the person
you mentioned.

155
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,640
He was recently imprisoned.

156
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,120
Have a drink.

157
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,320
Come on.

158
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,400
Why is he taking so long?

159
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,520
Have a drink.

160
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:08,840
You should eat more.

161
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:12,680
You too, eat something.

162
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,520
I caught you, didn't I?

163
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:19,280
Why not fulfill your mother's wish
and marry Princess?

164
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:20,760
You think you can catch me?

165
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,320
Fine, eat some.

166
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:27,880
Alright.

167
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,880
Come on.

168
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:33,000
What's going on?

169
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,400
What are you doing?

170
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:35,520
What's this all about?

171
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:37,760
What's happning?

172
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,320
Are you crazy?

173
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:42,880
Honey, stop! Win or lose, you'll end up
in jail or the hospital.

174
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,560
Let's report him and make him pay.

175
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,120
Hey,

176
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,000
where did this rascal come from?

177
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,680
This teapot cost me
five taels of silver!

178
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:56,080
I'll take you to the authorities.

179
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:56,880
Go.

180
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,120
Let's go.

181
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,280
Xiao Ziqi,

182
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,120
you're ruthless.

183
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:07,220
(Prison)

184
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,440
Official Li,

185
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:38,040
someone asked me
to pass along a message.

186
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,160
Do you still remember

187
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:41,800
(Official Li, Censer)
years ago,

188
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,960
when the East Lake was
as blue as the sky,

189
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:46,200
and we two were drifting in a boat,

190
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,600
lying drunk among the flowers?

191
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:11,440
Xiao Ziqi,

192
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:13,080
I'll catch you and bring you back.

193
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,600
(Now that I have the lead,)

194
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,760
(why not leave tomorrow?)

195
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:02,620
♪In the mortal world,
I sail a small boat♪

196

♪Beneath the moon,
the flowers seem frail♪

197
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,600
(If you're reading this letter,)

198
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:12,960
(it means my weak and helpless husband)

199
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,560
(has fallen into your hands.)

200
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:16,560
(Alas.)

201
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:20,840
(Whether you intend
to rob or assault him,)

202
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:24,280
(for my sake as the sect leader
of Changliu Sect,)

203
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:26,480
(could you please spare him for now?)

204
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,520
(Bring this letter)

205
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:30,800
(to Changliu Mountain)

206
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,040
(and I promise to give you
10 taels of gold.)

207
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:40,720
I might not be able to give 10 taels.

208
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:43,680
Make it eight.

209
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:48,960
No,

210
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:49,680
five taels.

211
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:53,080
(Please don't harm him.)

212
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:55,840
(I'm willing to pay five taels of gold
to ransom him.)

213
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:57,200
(Hmm.)

214
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:58,800
(If it's not enough,)

215
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,920
(we can negotiate further.)
