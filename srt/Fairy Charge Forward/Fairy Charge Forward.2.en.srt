00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:57,200
This...

10
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:00,160
This is an ancient divine artifact.

11
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:02,280
It contains hidden mysteries.

12
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:05,760
(Isn't this just made last month?)

13
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,040
What do you think, Master?

14
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,440
Let me take a look.

15
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:24,440
Hey, you...

16
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:25,280
What...

17
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:32,480
What's this?

18
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,240
Get a fire stick.

19
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:54,160
Hey,

20
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,600
isn't this our sect's forbidden ground?

21
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,800
So the legendary treasure
is truly hidden there.

22
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:04,280
It seems there's hope
for revitalizing our Changliu Sect.

23
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:10,400
What's the next question?

24
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,430
There is no next question.

25
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:15,000
Master Xiao, you're very intelligent.

26
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:17,040
The revival of Changliu Sect

27
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,520
will depend on you and the sect leader.

28
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,480
Oh my,

29
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,880
isn't this too hasty?

30
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:26,760
Oh, with Master Xiao overseeing you,

31
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:27,560
your misfortune

32
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:30,240
will surely improve significantly.

33
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:32,160
Alright, enough talking.

34
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,960
Since he's passed the test,
let's make arrangements.

35
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,120
We'll get married.

36
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:40,520
Nonsense.

37
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,600
As the sect leader,

38
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:45,080
how can you treat marriage lightly?

39
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:48,840
We must choose an auspicious day.

40
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,360
Let me calculate.

41
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:55,520
Oh,

42
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:57,800
today is fine.

43
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:58,360
Huh?

44
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,480
Quickly, make arrangements.

45
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,360
A quarter to six tonight,

46
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,800
we'll hold the wedding.

47
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:03,160
Good.

48
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:03,680
Let's go.

49
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:06,560
Wait, I...

50
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,720
(I need to know if this place)

51
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,720
(has already colluded with Shaozhou.)

52
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:37,800
(Changliu Mountain spans the borders
of Shaozhou and Yongzhou)

53
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,680
(with treacherous terrain.)

54
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,560
(It's difficult to attack.)

55
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:44,360
(Bandits often occupy this area.)

56
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,600
(Now, with Shaozhou
stirring up trouble,)

57
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,240
(there might be changes.)

58
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:52,160
(On this trip,
you must investigate secretly)

59
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,600
(and find out everything.)

60
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,800
(I won't fail you, Father.)

61
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:11,160
(This is a Shaozhou style sword.)

62
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,560
(Have they indeed secretly...)

63
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:24,920
Here.

64
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:27,560
Try it on.

65
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,920
Do we really have to get married?

66
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,010
Can't we just sworn instead?

67
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,320
No.

68
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:34,520
Put it on.

69
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,360
If not, then...

70
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:44,920
Here,

71
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,000
let me help you.

72
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,120
Hey, no need.

73
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:48,800
Don't run away.

74
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:49,920
No need.

75
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,000
Stop running.

76
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:52,920
You...

77
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:53,760
Stop running.

78
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:55,760
Stop chasing.

79
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,040
Don't run.

80
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:59,360
Hello, Elder.

81
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,240
Hey, you...

82
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:02,360
You...

83
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,160
What are you...

84
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:06,560
Is it so difficult
to put on the clothes?

85
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,440
Stop chasing!

86
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:11,560
Stop running.

87
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,160
Lipei,

88
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:15,480
bad news!

89
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:17,200
Elder has been knocked unconscious.

90
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18,360
What?

91
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,000
Here.

92
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,040
Who was trying to harm you?

93
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:33,000
Quick, that person

94
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:37,440
took the map and headed
to the Immortal Pavilion.

95
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,440
Is he your accomplice?

96
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,120
What are you talking about?

97
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:44,160
The treasure of our sect
has been hidden for years

98
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,560
and no one has ever deciphered it.

99
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:46,280
How did you know?

100
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:49,160
Well, that thing looks so crude.

101
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,920
It looks like it's meant to be broken.

102
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,360
And the hidden message technique
using fire

103
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,000
to reveal writing is a basic skill.

104
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,800
It's just writing on paper
with sugar water.

105
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:02,880
Stop!

106
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:03,560
Smarty-pants.

107
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,600
You're the smarty-pants.

108
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:10,800
Huh.

109
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:12,640
What did you give me?

110
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:14,560
Seven-Day Soul-Draining Pill.

111
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:15,560
There is no antidote.

112
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,440
You'll die within seven days.

113
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,760
You're indeed an evil sect.

114
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:22,240
Stop arguing.

115
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,920
Quickly, find the secret treasure

116
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:27,400
before the thieves do.

117
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:35,100
(Immortal Pavilion)

118
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,520
This should be it.

119
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:40,440
Yes.

120
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:41,840
Let's go.

121
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,840
Evil spirits inside.

122
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,120
Keep out.

123
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:05,840
Stay here and I'll go check.

124
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:06,960
Are you sure?

125
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,400
If you dare to escape,

126
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,040
you'll die within seven days.

127
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,400
The outer area of the forbidden ground

128
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:38,120
is a maze based on the Eight Trigrams

129
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,760
and there are traps everywhere.

130
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:42,480
It's hard for ordinary people
to get out.

131
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,080
Why am I back here again?

132
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,240
