00:00:58,180 --> 00:01:01,060
(Signor: Zheng Shiqiang, Bai Yan)

10
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:12,240
(Is there something
suspicious going on?)

11
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:18,840
How's your discussion going?

12
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:21,520
Ah, we still need more time.

13
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,400
Well, since you'll be staying
a few more days,

14
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:25,480
I'll prepare some essentials for you.

15
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:28,000
Come with me.

16
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,640
Are you OK?

17
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,640
I'm...I'm fine.

18
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,520
I forgot I had an injury on my shoulder

19
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,440
and it's reopened a bit.

20
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:05,720
Could you help me apply some medicine?

21
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:06,520
I have...

22
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:07,520
blood phobia.

23
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,240
Xuefu went down the mountain
so I have to ask you.

24
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:16,890
Is this the right spot?

25
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:21,000
Uh, a little more to the left.

26
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:22,520
Oh.

27
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,640
A bit lower...lower still.

28
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,400
Try to bear with it.

29
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:37,920
OK.

30
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,040
Hmm,

31
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,320
by the way,

32
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:11,240
how many people are in your family?

33
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,280
Uh, my father...

34
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:16,720
my father, mother and a younger brother.

35
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:20,480
That sounds nice.

36
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:25,440
My father was a scholar
on his way to the imperial exam,

37
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,600
but my mother took a liking to him

38
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,360
and kidnapped...

39
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:30,880
brought him up the mountain.

40
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:34,240
He taught the children here

41
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:36,280
and earned money to support the family.

42
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,560
Everyone said they were a perfect match.

43
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:43,960
But after my mother passed away,

44
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,880
my father became very upset.

45
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,000
He was still very kind to me though.

46
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,160
To me,

47
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:53,240
he's my favorite person in the world.

48
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:01,480
I can tell.

49
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,680
Your father must've loved you a lot.

50
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:04,720
Yes,

51
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:08,880
but five years ago,

52
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:10,320
he suddenly left.

53
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:13,680
Why?

54
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:15,280
(Just ask her about that.)

55
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:16,880
If that's the case,

56
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,400
how did he sign the document?

57
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:19,560
I don't know,

58
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,080
but the seal is definitely my father's.

59
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:24,850
We couldn't understand the rest,
like the contract and investment

60
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:25,440
it mentioned.

61
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,440
(The document is certainly confusing.)

62
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,680
(Is she truly unaware?)

63
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:33,120
Could it be a villager in need of money

64
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,920
to bury their father or to marry?

65
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:38,040
Or perhaps a child in need

66
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,440
of food and education?

67
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:43,240
So, your father needed the money
to do these good deeds?

68
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:46,720
He'd often give away
small amounts of money.

69
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,720
But 800 taels of gold?

70
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,880
I've never seen
that much money in my life.

71
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,040
Could he have used it
to feed disaster victims?

72
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,680
Even so, it wouldn't require that much.

73
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:01,960
I have no idea how to repay it.

74
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:02,880
Why repay it?

75
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:04,560
This isn't debt.

76
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,480
What do you mean?

77
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,960
This is investment money.

78
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:11,240
Your father agreed to invest,

79
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:13,600
so it's not debt, but investment.

80
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,480
If he no longer wishes to invest,

81
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,600
he could find a way to withdraw.

82
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,360
Investment?

83
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,000
How...

84
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,880
How could he?

85
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:24,480
He and I both have the same curse
of financial misfortune.

86
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,120
Help me take a look

87
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,880
and explain what this means.

88
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:35,680
What?

89
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,840
He's Master Jinse
who wrote me as a villain

90
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,120
who kidnaps children to practice?

91
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:39,960
And apparently,

92
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,560
in the sequel, you'll castrate yourself
to practice the skill.

93
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,960
I must find him and have a word.

94
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:46,240
Why did he ruin the reputation
of Changliu Sect

95
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,760
Where is he? Bring him to me!

96
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:52,200
Wait a minute.

97
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,240
Why are we running away?

98
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,760
Elder has recognized you by now.

99
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:55,920
He'll come to question you.

100
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,320
Don't be rash!

101
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,320
Wait.

102
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:09,680
Lipei! Bad news!

103
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:14,360
That woman from Tianji Sect
is demanding the debt

104
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:16,520
and they're fighting
with our men at the gate!

105
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,560
What?

106
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:40,200
So this is the best
your sect can muster?

107
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:15,400
(This flower feels off.
I feel powerless.)

108
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,480
Guard your Shenting acupoint
and retreat.

109
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:29,800
Attack her at Jiuwu and Guanling.

110
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:39,640
We were polite
at your wedding yesterday

111
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:41,480
and now you still try to delay?

112
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:42,200
Pah,

113
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,360
only one day?

114
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,440
You're really generous.

115
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,560
So, what do you want?

116
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,320
Stop saying it's debt.

117
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:50,840
This is clearly investment money.

118
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,880
Your father personally
signed this document

119
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,760
three years ago on behalf of Changliu,

120
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:58,800
agreeing to develop the southern slope
of Changliu Mountain.

121
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:02,560
The plan was to build
a hot spring resort, inns, restaurants

122
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,560
and tea houses

123
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,560
to attract tourists.

124
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,840
Our sect invested 1,200 taels

125
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:10,400
while your sect invested 800.

126
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:13,120
The craftsmen we hired
will arrive in three days

127
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,720
and construction
on the hot spring resort will begin.

128
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,320
In your dreams!

129
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:18,840
Then you may leave.

130
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:20,040
Oh?

131
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:25,200
Last year, someone spotted
the divine beast Chenghuang

132
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:27,080
on the southern slope
of Changliu Mountain

133
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:28,160
and reported to the City Lord.

134
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,540
He considers it an auspicious sign

135
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:30,960
and declared it a blessed area.

136
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,400
Without government approval,

137
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,360
touching any part of it
is a capital offense.

138
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:37,200
(He saw through their moves earlier)

139
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:39,760
(and now he knows so much
about the law.)

140
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:41,640
(He's got some skill.)

141
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:43,990
Right, sect leader?

142
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:46,480
Yes.

143
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:50,240
We came prepared, of course.

144
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:04,720
Wait a moment.

145
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:07,290
You only have the seal
from Shaozhou's government,

146
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:08,520
not Yongzhou's.

147
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,560
Typically,

148
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:13,800
both would need to be stamped

149
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,380
before any work can begin.

150
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,840
So, go get the Yongzhou seal

151
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,120
and then come back to us.

152
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:24,640
I didn't expect Sect Leader Zheng
to be such a faithless person.

153
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,480
You are applying

154
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:29,840
the tricks of businessmen
to matters of the martial world?

155
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:32,200
We're just discussing the facts.

156
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,680
Then we won't trouble you further today.

157
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,560
We'll visit another time.

158
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:37,960
Take care on your way out.

159
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,680
Your Highness,
are we really letting her go?

160
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:52,240
When Shaozhou's army passes through,

161
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,760
we'll take care of them.

162
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,000
(Bai Minmin, Princess of Shaozhou)
No need to create trouble now.

163
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,480
As for Xiao Ziqi,

164
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:01,160
he's indeed after something
at Changliu Mountain.

165
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,160
We've been planning for so long,

166
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,640
yet he's turned the tables

167
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:07,600
and managed to thrive
in Changliu Mountain.

168
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:12,000
I'm afraid he's taken control
of the sect.

169
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,640
In just a few days,

170
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:16,600
(Chenyan, maid of Bai Minmin)
he's won the sect leader's affection.

171
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,760
That's a testament to his cunning.

172
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:22,640
Since he's willingly stepped
into this trap,

173
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:25,920
we can't let him leave unscathed.

174
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:28,400
We must seize this opportunity

175
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:31,720
to sever the Yongzhou City Lord's
right-hand man.
