These are quite nice!

10
00:00:56,110 --> 00:00:56,840
Are they poisoned?

11
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:00,280
Without poison, they can't kill.

12
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,120
You savage woman,

13
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:03,560
I'll teach you a lesson!

14
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:06,080
Isn't the Etiquette Bureau

15
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:07,880
where you teach artistic skills?

16
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:10,200
Now you start teaching martial arts?

17
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:11,920
Master Ziqi, Master Ziyi.

18
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:15,000
Since the Etiquette Bureau
is occupied today,

19
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:16,840
why don't you

20
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,440
leave the task of teaching
Miss Zheng etiquette to me?

21
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:22,240
Well...

22
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,160
Are you suggesting
I'm not qualified enough, Chief Cui?

23
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:26,560
I wouldn't dare.

24
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:29,880
Master Ziqi's artistic skills are known
throughout the land.

25
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:31,160
How could I question you?

26
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:41,400
Are you afraid she'll bully me?

27
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:43,490
We're concerned
you'll tear this place down.

28
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:45,480
Good thing we arrived just in time.

29
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:47,200
Otherwise, Chief Cui

30
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,920
would surely have been terrified
by your iron fists.

31
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,520
You know me so well.

32
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:53,480
OK, my dear,

33
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:54,720
let's return home.

34
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,360
Wait a moment.

35
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:00,160
I heard at the banquet, all the noblewomen
will be showcasing their talents.

36
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:02,200
If I don't perform anything,

37
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:04,600
won't it be a little awkward?

38
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:06,120
No need to worry about that.

39
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,520
No way.

40
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,440
They prepared all these props
for me today

41
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:11,640
just to make me look bad.

42
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:13,080
I won't let them have their way.

43
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:16,080
Maybe I should just give Chief Cui
a proper beating.

44
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:16,680
Alright then,

45
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,880
since you feel so inclined,

46
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,640
I'll stay with you till the end.

47
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,280
Come on.

(Senior Master Mansion)

49
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,000
Lipei,

50
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:48,890
just perform the moves
you usually practice.

51
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,640
Make your sleeves flow

52
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,640
and spin a few more times.

53
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:53,440
Oh,

54
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:54,680
the sleeves.

55
00:02:58,700 --> 00:02:59,600
Spin a few more times.

56
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,560
Lipei, with your lightness,

57
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,760
you're already more graceful
than most women.

58
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,800
With the techniques I just taught you,

59
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,800
it should be nearly perfect.

60
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:40,240
Yes,

61
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,360
just like that.

62
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:45,480
Exactly,

63
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:46,360
just like that.

64
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:47,520
Spin a few more times.

65
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:48,240
Keep going.

66
00:03:49,010 --> 00:03:49,580
Keep spinning.

67
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:54,240
Continue.

68
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:56,600
Spin some more.

69
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,960

Alas.

82
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:08,680
Hey.

83
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:12,360
She looks nice.

84
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,120
Which...

85
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,380
Which family is she from?

86
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:17,600
I've never seen her before.

87
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,880
Is she promised to anyone yet?

88
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:27,360
City Lord and Lady Jun have arrived.

89
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,440
Ah, Princess
is also graceful as ever.

90
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:49,800
What a tough choice.

91
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,400
You're a fool.

92
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,240
Only kids make choices.

93
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:56,560

94
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,040
Ouch.

95
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,680
Thank you, Ziqi.

96
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:21,160
Lipei.

97
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:32,720
Sit.

98
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,000
Let me tell you...

99
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:36,680
No manners at all!

100
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:37,600
I woke up early...

101
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,960
I'll ask someone to bring him over.

102
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:39,880
I'm exhausted.

103
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:40,680
Forget it.

104
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:43,440
Ziyi's always hated formalities.

105
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:44,640
Let him be.

106
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:00,840
Hmph.

107
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,440
Today's banquet
is to welcome Princess,

108
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,160
so everyone present
should showcase their talents

109
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,320
to make her

110
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,000
feel welcome.

111
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,880
(Lady Jun, City Lord's wife)
I heard Miss Zheng is quite the dancer.

112
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,880
Why not have her perform for us?

113
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,000
Hmm.

114
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:24,200
Bravo.

115
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,240
I've always heard

116
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,680
women of Yongzhou
are gentle and elegant.

117
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,880
Now that I've seen one,

118
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,200
it seems the rumors are true.

119
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,480
Thank you, Your Highness.

120
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,240
She can't even bow properly.

121
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,080
How rude!

122
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:36,440
Miss Zheng is from the common folk.

123
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:39,600
There's no need to be too harsh.

124
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,800
I must have this woman.

125
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:50,240
Who?

126
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:51,400
Who was that?

127
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:53,720
Eat more fruit and stop dreaming.

128
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:00,160
I've long heard of Senior Master's
exceptional musical talent.

129
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:01,560
On today's banquet,

130
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:05,240
might I boldly ask
to perform a duet with you?

131
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:07,760
Why not?

132
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:09,840
Ziqi.

133
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,040
Yes.

134
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,080
This plum is really sour.

135
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:46,960
What a fine rendition.

136
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:50,080
Many thanks to Princess Minmin

137
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,720
for this delightful melody.

138
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:54,240
It's Ziqi's accompaniment
that made it possible.

139
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,480
Princess has traveled a long way.

140
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:01,240
Ziqi.

141
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:02,600
Huh?

142
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:05,480
Make sure you fulfill
your duty as the host.

143
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,120
Yes, Father.

144
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:28,080
Sir.

145
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:28,360
Yes?

146
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:29,840
Bring me two jars of wine.

147
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:31,360
I'm sorry.

148
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,240
My wife is about to give birth
and I need to hurry back.

149
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:34,400
I'm sorry.

150
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,120
