So you're not going back
to the mansion tonight?

20
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:53,600
No.

21
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,360
Xuefu went up the mountain,

22
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,520
so I need to stay at the shop.

Just...

30
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:11,840
Lipei, I still think you should
return to Changliu sooner.

31
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,880

I'll have to inspect the body first.

200
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:35,320
Don't kill me!
