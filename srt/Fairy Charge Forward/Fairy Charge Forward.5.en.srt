9
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:56,680
(Shaozhou is eyeing us covetously.)

10
00:00:57,410 --> 00:00:59,390
(Changliu Mountain is
a prime strategic location.)

11
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:01,680
(Time is running out.)

12
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:04,480
(I need to familiarize myself
with the terrain here.)

13
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:08,320
(That Tianji Sect
is quite suspicious as well.)

14
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:19,560
Master.

15
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:21,520
(When did he come?)

16
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:22,720
Such a fine interest you have.

17
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:26,320
I don't usually see this scenery

18
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,130
so I just painted it.

19
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:28,280
I'm flattered.

20
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:31,600
Ah, I apologize for yesterday, Master.

21
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:35,000
Tianji Sect is a powerful sect
in Shaozhou.

22
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,400
They often bully others
with their numbers.

23
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,960
They even dared to disrupt our wedding.

24
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,400
What did your sect do to provoke them?

25
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:46,880
You may not know,

26
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:49,000
but Changliu Mountain

27
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:52,040
spans both Shaozhou and Yongzhou,

28
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:55,480
making it a place
where various factions coexist.

29
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:00,160
As a small sect without backing,

30
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:03,800
we can only survive in hiding.

31
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:05,280
Oh.

32
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,280
(It seems they might not)

33
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,520
(be allied with Shaozhou after all.)

34
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,520
I'm packed. Let's go.

35
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,400
What's this?

36
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,840
This is the document Tianji Sect's

37
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,290
Hall Master brought half a month ago,

38
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,480
claiming we owe them 800 taels of gold.

39
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:42,400
Here's the evidence.

40
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:43,920
Who is Zheng Shiqiang?

41
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,080
My father.

42
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:51,000
(Could this be evidence of collusion?)

43
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,720
(But why would she
leave it out so openly?)

44
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,400
Let's go.

45
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:59,440
Oh right,

46
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,480
take this for self-defense.

47
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:04,320
What is it?

48
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,960
Don't smell it. Just one sniff and...

49
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:12,560
Xiao Ziqi, why won't you listen?

50
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:15,400
Wake up.

51
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,280
Wake up.

52
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,400
Wake up.

53
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,080
Where am I?

54
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,120
What's this place?

55
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:37,320
This incense shouldn't
make you lose your wits.

56
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:38,800
Clear your head.

57
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:39,840
It's time to go.

58
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:47,040
Come.

59
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:49,320
Wait.

60
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:54,240
Meeting you was fate.

61
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,080
This is for you.

62
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,480
The handwriting is quite good.

63
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:03,560
Did you write it?

64
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:05,240
Yes.

65
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,120
Thank you.

66
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,180
(I need to find a way to stay here
and investigate further.)

67
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:11,680
Let's go.

68
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,840
"Chronicles of Changliu II"?

69
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,840
There's even a sequel?

70
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,960
Yes, it's my friend's.

71
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,080
I'll return it.

72
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:33,560
Wait a minute.

73
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:36,520
This looks familiar.

74
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,240
Why does it look exactly the same?

75
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:45,400
Ah,

76
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,120
there is a resemblance.

77
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,720
I...I can explain!

78
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:07,040
So you're the one who ruined
the reputation of my sect!

79
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:22,960
Oh well.

80
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:32,640
How should I punish you?

81
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:40,120
Sect leader, there's an urgent matter.

82
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,240
Elder said your husband
should handle it.

83
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,920
Our accounts are really in the red.

84
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,600
Oh, I see.

85
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:59,920
Managing to run a sect into poverty.

86
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,480
Only you could do such a thing.

87
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,800
It's all your fault.

88
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:13,480
Madam Zheng owes 90 coins.

89
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,320
Uncle Li owes half a tael.

90
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:16,280
Oh.

91
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:19,480
They're tenants who farm our land
down the mountain.

92
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:22,080
I noticed their crops
haven't been good recently,

93
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,290
so I didn't collect their dues.

94
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:24,960
Why is that?

95
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:27,720
There are hundreds
of families like them.

96
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,760
And why does the sect

97
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:31,360
give 30 coins to Madam Li?

98
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:33,600
You didn't know.

99
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,520
That's a poor woman.

100
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:39,360
Her husband passed away
less than a month ago

101
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:42,320
and the local bully tried to seize her,
claiming she owed him

102
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,080
30 coins.

103
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:44,800
It was shameful.

104
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:47,400
So I paid the debt

105
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:51,080
and gave the bully a good beating.

106
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:53,160
Don't worry about it.

107
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,600
Just focus on the accounts.

108
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:57,840
Your sect is surprisingly compassionate.

109
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:04,520
Lipei, I've caught them all.

110
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,920
Good, since they're all here,

111
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,040
let's execute them on the spot.

112
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:12,840
Please spare us!

113
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,080
Please spare us!

114
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:15,520
Please spare us!

115
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,480
Spare us!

116
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:19,600
And you?

117
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:22,080
Master Jinse,
do you have nothing to say?

118
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,080
So, it's him?

119
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,600
He's Master Jinse.

120
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:34,840
Why did you write the novel?

121
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:41,160
(My intention was to portray Changliu
as a place of conflict)

122
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,780
(to warn the people to leave,)

123
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,000
(lest they be caught)

124
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,280
(in future strife.)

125
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:50,960
Stories about evil sects are popular.

126
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:52,960
Foolish!

127
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:55,760
Even if you wanted money,
you can't write lies that slander them.

128
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:56,560
Exactly.

129
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,360
Enough.

130
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,640
I see you're genuinely repentant,

131
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,640
so I'll give you another chance.

132
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:06,240
You,

133
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,920
rewrite "Chronicles of Changliu II."

134
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:10,920
That's it?

135
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:14,600
Write stories by day
and sort accounts by night.

136
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,000
This is too much.

137
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:18,960
Don't worry.

138
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:23,240
You'll still have time to sleep.

139
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,320
You three, assist him.

140
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:30,600
If the rewrite is good, I'll let you go.

141
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,640
If not...

142
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:37,040
I'll do my best to write well.

143
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:37,840
Let's go.

144
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,240
Spare us.

145
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:53,480
Master Jinse,

146
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:54,720
I suggest

147
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:57,880
we turn it into a romance.

148
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,360
Good.

149
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,960
I've never written a romance before.

150
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:04,660
It may be difficult for me.

151
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:05,480
Oh,

152
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:08,120
just use the same passion
you have when you're in love.

153
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,360
It'll be fine.

154
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,360
Exactly.

155
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,680
I've never experienced that.

156
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:16,720
But you've surely seen it happen.

157
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,360
I'll dictate and you'll write.

158
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:21,320
A man and a woman

159
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,840
meet by chance,

160
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:27,080
then fight and become enemies.

161
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:32,320
But the more they fight,
the closer they become.

162
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:37,560
He escapes and she pursues

163
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:42,360
and a beautiful kiss seals their fate.

164
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:48,240
Hey.

165
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,080
Isn't that brilliant?

166
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:50,840
Brilliant!

167
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,920
Absolutely brilliant!

168
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:55,560
No way.

169
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:01,320
No, I write to promote
righteousness and chivalry,

170
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:03,120
not to indulge in petty romance.

171
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,840
Master, if you don't rewrite it,

172
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:10,000
that woman will kill us.

173
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:12,120
Yes.

174
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:13,720
Master Xiao,

175
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:16,160
Elder sent me to get the account.

176
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:18,640
There are still two I need to review.

177
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,360
Alas.

178
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,120
Come.

179
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,200
How did it go?

180
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,000
He did keep those two books.

181
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,320
Do you think he noticed
the discrepancies?

182
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:39,960
Oh, I heard the sect leader
is hiding something.

183
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,120
Her new husband is

184
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,760
(Xun, disciple of Changliu)
the one who wrote the book smearing us.

185
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:48,960
Really?

186

♪In the mortal world,
I sail a small boat♪
