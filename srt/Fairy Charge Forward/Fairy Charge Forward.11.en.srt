00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:57,680
I'm sure you've heard plenty

10
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:58,840
about my chivalrous deeds.

11
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:00,520
Yes, they're all true.

12
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:02,600
Master,

13
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:03,920
I finally found you.

14
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:04,780
(Sancai, Xiao's servant)

15
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:06,040
Sancai.

16
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:09,080
(So, he didn't come because
of my reputation at all.)

17
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:14,380
I've finished drawing the map
of Changliu Mountain.

18
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:15,880
Deliver it to Officer Sun.

19
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:18,600
Master,

20
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:21,400
your solo mission
this time is far too risky.

21
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,440
If something happened to you,

22
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,920
how would I explain to the City Lord?

23
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:27,440
Nothing venture,

24
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:28,480
nothing have.

25
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:30,960
Here,

26
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:33,320
look.

27
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,160
The Tianji Sect plans to build
a hot spring resort here.

28
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:39,920
They must be after something.

29
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,640
Their members are ruthless

30
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:43,640
and highly skilled.

31
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:46,400
I can't investigate further.

32
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,680
Inform Officer Sun
to conduct an investigation.

33
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:54,080
Master,

34
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,280
aren't you coming with me?

35
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,680
I have some personal matters
to attend to.

36
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:01,600
I'll leave soon.

37
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,080
Alright.

38
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,000
How about it?

39
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:16,920
Does that handsome guy

40
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,860
have any intention
of joining our Changliu Sect?

41
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:20,240
He wants something else.

42
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,080
By the way, I've been away for months.

43
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,080
My family must be worried about me
since they can't find me.

44
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,880
So, you're leaving?

45
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:33,520
Are you alright?

46
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:34,720
I'm fine.

47
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,890
I've just been sitting for too long
and my legs are numb.

48
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,640
Truly, people can't afford to slack off.

49
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:43,000
I'll continue working on

50
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,900
the remaining parts
of "Chronicles of Changliu."

51
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:47,880
But what about those assassins
hunting you?

52
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Once I return, someone will meet me.

53
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,640
They won't dare come after me so easily.

54
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,080
Then I'm relieved.

55
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,280
But what about you?

56
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:57,400
After I leave,

57
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,880
how will you explain things to Elder?

58
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,120
No worries.

59
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:03,600
I'll just tell him
we're not compatible,

60
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:04,590
so we separated.

61
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,120
And about your destined one...

62
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,960
Oh well, I'll just ask him
for another token

63
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,520
and find someone else.

64
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:13,120
No one ever said the destined one
has to be one person.

65
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:14,800
(So,)

66
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,240
(all along, I could be replaced.)

67
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:18,520
(Both for you)

68
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,280
(and for my father.)

69
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,640
(We're not even friends.)

70
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:23,720
It's fine, really.

71
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:26,560
Look, you've been away from home

72
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,400
and I've troubled you
for so long as well.

73
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,960
Your family must be very worried.

74
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,320
You should go back.

75
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,680
Once you've decided when to leave,

76
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,360
I'll personally escort you.

77
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:39,960
That's very kind, Miss Zheng.

78
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,440
Master Xiao.

79
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:50,720
Wait for me down there.

80
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,880
Ah, Master Xiao,

81
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,560
when it comes to matters
between you couple,

82
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:01,240
it's not my place to meddle.

83
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,280
But Lipei lost her mother
since she was young

84
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,360
and knows little about love

85
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,120
between men and women.

86
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:09,440
If...

87
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,240
Elder,

88
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:12,040
whether today or in the future,

89
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:13,600
I trust Miss Zheng's character

90
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:16,480
and believe Changliu Mountain

91
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,480
won't involve itself in those disputes.

92
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:20,840
So,

93
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,040
Minister,

94
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,120
you can rest assured.

95
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:27,600
Ah,

96
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:30,040
I didn't expect you to recognize me.

97
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:33,040
If I'm not mistaken,

98
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,840
you must be Senior Master.

99
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:36,680
I am.

100
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:37,320
Huh.

101
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,880
However, I have a question.

102
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:40,840
Why did you

103
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,320
resign and leave back then?

104
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,400
It's a long story.

105
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,680
At the time, the City Lord and I
had differing views

106
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:50,240
and my proposals were
repeatedly rejected.

107
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,800
I was disheartened,

108
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:55,580
so I came to Changliu Mountain
to seek refuge with an old friend.

109
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:56,760
But I found

110
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:00,040
scouts from Shaozhou were active here.

111
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:02,360
Fearing they harbored ill intentions,

112
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,400
I had people

113
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:06,920
report the auspicious signs
in the southern slope of the mountain

114
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,960
to draw your attention.

115
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,080
So, it was your idea.

116
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,800
At that time,
when the Shaozhou envoy visited

117
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,440
and proposed building
a government road here,

118
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,200
the City Lord couldn't find
a reason to refuse.

119
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:23,400
Fortunately, you assisted in secret.

120
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:28,440
Now, the Tianji Sect brought up
this place again.

121
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,560
I fear they have some ulterior motives.

122
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,000
Don't worry, Elder.

123
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,760
Once I return to the city,

124
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,800
I'll relay your concerns

125
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,240
to my father.

126
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,120
By the way, Master Xiao,

127
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,760
is there really

128
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:45,480
no possibility with Lipei?

129
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:51,560
One side is willing,

130
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:53,400
yet the other isn't.

131
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:56,840
It can't be forced.

154

The Tianji Sect woman is here again.

155
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:32,040
She says she already
got the seal of Yongzhou.

156
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:40,680
Why does this letter
read like a farewell?

157
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,800
Isn't he just going for some business?

158
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:44,360
Won't he be back?

159
00:08:44,410 --> 00:08:46,040
Don't meddle
in married people's affairs.

160
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,840
Let me deal with the Tianji Sect first.

161
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,120
Oh, OK.

162
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,600
Are you trying to tell me

163
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,080
even though I've got the Yongzhou seal,

164
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,640
you still won't acknowledge it?

165
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:29,680
That's exactly right.

166
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,400
If it had

167
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:34,760
a handprint or a handwritten signature,

168
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,720
we'd naturally acknowledge it.

169
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,960
But as for the seal,

170
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,520
what if someone forged it?

171
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:42,240
Indeed,

172
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,680
there's nothing I can do about that.

173
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:49,280
If you refuse today,
I have no way to force you.

174
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,560
But if word gets out
that you've broken your promise,

175
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,200
how will people out there view you?

176
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:58,680
How will they view Changliu Mountain?

177
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:01,760
Lipei,

178
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:05,760
this matter concerns
the fate of Changliu.

179
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:07,400
If we lack money,

180
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,080
we can chip in ourselves.

181
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:11,320
I'm also willing to contribute.

182
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,560
This project won't be completed
in just a day,

183
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,640
but it's not without benefits

184
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,440
for Changliu Mountain.

185
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,720
Perhaps we can negotiate

186
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:28,240
monthly payments

187
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:30,720
and achieve a win-win.

188
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:35,200
Alright,

189
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:36,840
I agree to honor the contract.

190
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:39,320
But I have one condition.

191
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,280
I estimate

192
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:44,480
this project will take at least
three to five years, right?

193
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,120
So, I have no reason

194
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:48,080
to give you 800 taels of gold
all at once.

195
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:51,640
I demand monthly payments
according to the schedule.

196
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,360
Agreed.

197
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:56,320
But if there are delays,

198
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,040
the interest will double.

199
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,200
It's a deal.

200
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,080
Lipei,

201
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,720
I still feel uneasy about this.

202
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:05,280
Should we consult with your husband?

203
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,880
Oh, he's gone.

204
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,520
Lipei?

205
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,080
Lipei?

206
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,120
Oh.

207
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,240
Alright, I'll talk to you later.

208
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,720
I'm heading to the hot spring site now.
