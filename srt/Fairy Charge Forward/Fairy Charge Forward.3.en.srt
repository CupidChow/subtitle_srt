Ouch.

Sect leader Zheng,
you have refined taste.

18
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:02,320
Is there something special
about resting here?

19
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:04,880
Rest?

20
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,290
I just ran into a tree.

21
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:07,760
Help me up.

22
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:13,360
Thank you.

23
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:15,680
- This way.
- Wait a moment.

24
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:18,960
How did you avoid those traps?

25
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:22,040
The moment I got the map,

26
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:24,320
I memorized all the terrain.

27
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:26,090
Anyone who knows
Eight Trigrams could do it.

00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,000
Impressive, right?

I don't believe it.

00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:26,440
why not stay?

33
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:31,520
Master,

34
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,680
do you like it here?

35
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:38,840
Would you stay with us forever?

36
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,520
Form is emptiness, emptiness is form.

37
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,400
All phenomena

38
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,400
are illusory.

Become my husband.

58
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,320
No,

59
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,160
it's not like that.

60
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:54,440
They're just talking nonsense.

61
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:55,920
We're not an evil sect.

62
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,600
Don't listen to them.

63
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,240
Forgive me.

64
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,600
Why did you flick me?

65
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,040
Did you see yourself just now?

66
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:09,120
We were affected
by a mind-confusing incense.

67
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,120
Oh, I see.

68
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:13,800
But still you can't flick me.

69
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:15,160
I was saving you!

70
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,480
Look at how you were just now.

71
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,880
You were lost in a dream.

72
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,320
Lost in a dream?

73
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:22,240
I was having a nightmare!

74
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:23,680
A nightmare?

75
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,720
Someone wrote a novel,
"Chronicles of Changliu"

76
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:28,560
and they portrayed us as an evil sect.

77
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,800
I dreamt we were being attacked.

78
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:32,560
How hateful!

79
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:36,000
He ruined the reputation of Changliu
and my own honor.

80
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,920
Maybe the author

81
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:41,400
just heard some rumors.

82
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,560
He probably didn't mean to slander you.

83
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,360
Why are you defending him?

84
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,000
Well...

85
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,240
Let's go find the mechanism.

86
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,120
I know where it is.

87
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:54,860
Follow me.

88
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,120
Where?

89
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:07,740
(Immortal Pavilion)

90
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,480
Could the treasure be here?

91
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:34,320
Are you also here for the treasure?

92
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,680
If you know,
hand over our sect's treasure

93
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,040
and I'll spare your life.

94
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:44,840
Let's see if you can.

95
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,920
The incense you inhaled

96
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,240
contains a muscle-weakening powder.

97
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:34,080
Once you activate your inner strength,
it'll take effect.

98
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,320
Despicable!

99
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:39,560
Sir,

100
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:43,560
you seem like a righteous person,
not someone from the evil sect.

101
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:46,320
We have no grudge against you.

102
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:47,570
Just pretend we were never here

103
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:48,720
and you never met us.

104
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,520
We owe each other nothing.

105
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:54,160
Don't try any tricks!

106
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:55,840
Here's the deal.

107
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:57,280
Today

108
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,920
is my fasting day,

109
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:01,160
so I don't want to kill too many.

110
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:07,360
One of you may live,

111
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:09,360
but the other

112
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,840
must drink this poison

113
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:17,280
and I'll let you go.

114
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,480
Don't listen to this madman!

115
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,080
No!

116
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:44,840
I'm sorry,

117
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,640
it's all my fault.

118
00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:49,990
Can you give me the antidote
to the Soul-Draining Pill?

119
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:50,800
Oh.

120
00:08:58,310 --> 00:08:59,880
I shouldn't have taken you to the sect.

121
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,840
It's because of the rule of the sect.

122
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:05,400
I must get married to officially
become the sect leader.

123
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,080
If you die,

124
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:11,560
I'll repay you in the next life.

125
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:12,960
Alright.

126
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:18,040
I'll go find someone to save you.

127
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:19,600
Stay put.

128
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:39,680
Ah!

129
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:42,760
Aren't you about to die?

130
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:44,760
Yes.
