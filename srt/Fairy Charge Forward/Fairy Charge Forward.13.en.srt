9
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,880
Lipei, something terrible happened!

10
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,200
Someone sent this sachet and said

11
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:14,720
Ziqi caused trouble in the teahouse
and was thrown in prison.

12
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:16,680
What?

13
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:19,240
Someone dared to bully my husband...

14
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:20,520
No, my friend?

15
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:22,080
They must have a death wish!

16
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,600
Lipei, calm down.

17
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,000
It's the official prison.

18
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:26,000
So what?

19
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:27,960
How has Ziqi treated us?

20
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:29,240
He's been extremely kind.

21
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:30,200
So do we rescue him?

22
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:30,760
Yes, we do.

23
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:31,840
- Let's go.
- Go.

24
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:48,640
Hard to understand.

25
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:49,880
Lipei,

26
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:52,080
I think we might need
to bribe the officials.

27
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:53,640
Otherwise...

28
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:55,640
We don't have money.

29
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:57,440
Li...

30
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:01,880
Lipei.

31
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:07,800
That's what you meant?

32
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:09,000
Huh.

33
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:11,000
Keep it up!

34
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:12,720
Alright.

35
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:21,900
(Prison)

36
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,280
Sir, please let me

37
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:24,840
see my brother one last time.

38
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,160
Open the door.

39
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:28,720
Thank you.

40
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,440
Don't be afraid, I'm here to save you.

41
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:57,540
(Prison)

42
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,760
Restricted area. Unauthorized ones

43
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:02,690
must leave immediately.

44
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,120
Master Ziyi?

45
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:08,840
Well...

46
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:09,800
Come with me.

47
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:10,520
Search!

48
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:13,720
Ziqi,

49
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:18,640
you're holding a woman?

50
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:20,040
Now that you've returned,

51
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,880
why didn't you go to meet Princess?

52
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:24,880
If I'm going down,
I'm taking you with me.

53
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:26,960
As you wish.

54
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:31,520
(It's her.)

55
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,320
Oh no,

56
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,640
Xiao Ziqi is still in prison.

57
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:10,520
Are you OK?

58
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,000
I'm fine.

59
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:16,000
How's your health?

60
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:16,560
Are you hurt?

61
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18,320
No,

62
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,040
that incense wasn't very toxic.

63
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:21,200
Where...

64
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,120
Where are we?

65
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:25,320
Senior Master Mansion.

66
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:31,200
You work at the Senior Master Mansion?

67
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:32,760
Impressive!

68
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:35,640
Are you hungry?

69
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:36,840
Let's eat something first.

70
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,160
Sure.

71
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:44,920
The benefits of working
at this mansion are amazing.

72
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,880
The clothes, the accommodation

73
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:49,080
and even the pastries are so exquisite.

74
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,560
Are they hiring?

75
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,440
Could you ask for me?

76
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,800
With my martial arts skills,

77
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,880
I could be a bodyguard.

78
00:05:59,410 --> 00:06:00,920
Being a bodyguard would be beneath you.

79
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:02,800
I have another job

80
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,240
that's perfect for you.

81
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:05,800
Tell me more.

82
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:07,560
Food and lodging?

83
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:09,360
How many days off do I get each month?

84
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:10,760
Food and lodging included.

85
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:12,280
Name your own salary.

86
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:25,680
Senior Master, here's the bird's
nest congee you requested.

87
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,960
One with sugar and one without.

88
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,040
This congee looks...

89
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,240
Wait.

90
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:37,000
What did she call you?

91
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:38,960
Master Ziyi.

92
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:39,920
Bring me some utensils.

93
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:42,200
I'll be having breakfast
with my brother today.

94
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,360
Lipei, do me a favor.

95
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:44,920
Why did she call you Senior Master?

96
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:45,880
I'll explain later.

97
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:46,980
There's no time right now.

98
00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:49,290
Can you pretend to be my wife
a little longer?

99
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,800
I was in such a hurry
and didn't even eat breakfast.

100
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,000
Ziqi, do you have breakfast...

101
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:56,160
Hey, it's you!

102
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,600
I knew it was you.

103
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,000
Ziyi, let me introduce you.

104
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,360
This is your sister-in-law.

105
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,800
We just got married
on Changliu Mountain.

106
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:06,920
Yes,

107
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,680
and we'll divorce in a few days.

108
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:09,800
Hey.

109
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,200
It's just a little tiff between us.

110
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,080
How can you talk about divorce?

111
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:17,700
This congee is great
for nourishing blood and energy.

112
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:18,800
Have some more.

113
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:23,040
Please.

114
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:24,320
Lipei,

115
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:25,520
I though you said

116
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:27,720
you didn't know my brother?

117
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,000
That's because the person you described

118
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,480
and the Xiao Ziqi I know
are completely different.

119
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:35,480
Huh?

120
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:36,480
Well,

121
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,960
how did you two meet?

122
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,800
We were on the mountain

123
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:42,680
together...

124
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:46,360
Hunting, we were hunting.

125
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:47,280
Hunting.

126
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:48,720
We ran into

127
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,080
each other...

128
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,920
We caught a wild boar.

129
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:54,920
Yes.

130
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,200
A huge one!

131
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,240
A wild boar.

132
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,480
(I almost slipped.)

133
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,480
(Fewer people should know
about the granny.)

134
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,800
The City Lord requested
you and Master Ziyi enter the palace.

135
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,280
to discuss the reception of Princess.

136
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:12,480
Got it.

137
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:15,480
(Lipei,)

138
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,400
(you'll see that shop)

139
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:18,760
(at the edge of the market.)

140
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:24,400
That's the one Ziqi was looking for.

141
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,160
Do you think we can run a business?

142
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,480
I think we can.

143
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:33,600
But

144
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:36,760
isn't this location
a bit out of the way?

145
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:38,680
You know how little money we have.

146
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:39,870
We're lucky to have this place.

147
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:40,560
Let's go.

148
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:41,680
Alright.

149
00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:52,480
We'll clean up a bit later.

150
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:54,400
We live upstairs
and run the shop downstairs

151
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,520
to keep an eye on things.

152
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:56,920
For the next few days,

153
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:58,560
you'll have to stay here alone.

154
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,240
I'll join you as soon as I can.

155
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:03,680
I don't think you'll have the time.

156
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:08,520
I'll send a letter to Elder

157
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:10,440
and have some goods
delivered immediately,

158
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,400
so we can open for business.

159
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,240
Great.

160
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:50,840
Lipei,

161
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:54,520
I've collected so many
romance novels recently.

162
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,280
Romantic novels are so good!

163
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,560
(Ziqi,)

164
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,680
(this is all I can do to help you.)

165
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,440
Oh, by the way, Lipei,

166
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,320
(20 percent off)
Sancai brought a gift this morning.

167
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:22,960
Oh.

168
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,040
When is Ziqi coming?

169
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,840
(Monkey Wine)
He's very busy with work.

170
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,320
I don't think he has time to come.

171
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:31,960
A new shop.

172
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:32,560
Fine.

173
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:34,260
Here are guests.

174
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:35,240
Oh.

175
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:36,440
Wow.

176
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:37,160
Please.

177
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,320
Come in, guests.

178
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:40,160
Wow,

179
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:41,880
what a huge Lingzhi mushroom!

180
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:42,920
Take a look.

181
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:43,880
It's rare.

182
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,600
It's all natural and wild.

183
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,280
Everything is 20 percent off.

184
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:47,760
20 percent off.

185
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:48,920
This looks pretty good.

186
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:49,680
Exactly.

187
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:53,400
Grandpa,

188
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,520
you died so tragically!

189
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,320
What's going on?

190
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:00,320
Hey, kid,

191
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:01,880
what are you doing?

192
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,120
Grandpa,

193
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:08,280
how could you die so tragically here?

194
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,640
Hey, come on.

195
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:10,480
Don't go!

196
00:11:11,010 --> 00:11:12,360
30 percent off! No, 40 percent off!

197
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,680
Why did they leave?

198
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:15,840
Fifty percent off!

199
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:17,640
This is ridiculous!

200
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:18,480
What's going on here?

201
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,600
Grandpa, you died so tragically!

202
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,320
They're so mean.

203
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,360
Yeah.

204
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,600
What exactly are you doing here?

205
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,440
(Beggar)
My grandpa got crashed and died here,

206
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:28,040
so I come to pay my respects every day.

207
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,640
How pitiful!

208
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:31,720
Uh,

209
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:33,400
I'm really sorry for what happened

210
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,520
to your family,

211
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:35,560
but you see,

212
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:37,480
we're trying to run a business here...

213
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:39,520
Grandpa is the name of my dog.

214
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:42,960
Are you messing with us, kid?

215
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:43,880
What's wrong with you?

216
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:45,720
What's going on here?

217
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:46,560
Why hitting a child?

218
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:47,040
He...

219
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:50,880
Tell me,

220
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,080
what do you want?

221
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:53,680
Five taels of silver.

222
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,760
- Give it to him.
- Hurry up!

223
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,640
- Just five taels.
- You're shameless!

224
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:00,840
Three taels, get out of here!

225
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,240
- This shop is a joke!
- Exactly.

226
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:08,800
We're letting him off too easily.

227
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,880
Teaching a child like him
is pointless.

228
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:13,720
I should teach his parents a lesson.
