Elder.

28
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:12,360
I heard your sequel
is starting to take shape.

29
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,000
I have a small favor to ask.

30
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:17,160
Please go ahead.

31
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:18,440
It's just...

32
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,920
I have an unreasonable request.

33
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,640
Could you write me

34
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,280
as a more powerful figure in the sequel?

35
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,720
How powerful exactly?

36
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,360
How powerful?

37
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:35,160
It would be best if I could
transcend the tribulation,

38
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,560
master celestial arts,

39
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,280
shatter stars with a single palm

40
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:40,460
and split the sky with my sword energy,

41
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,560
as a celestial being
capable of creating illusory realm.

42
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:49,400
Wouldn't that be a bit too fantastical?

43
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,200
I'm sure you can fulfill my wish.

44
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:54,560
I beg of you.

45
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:03,000
Ziqi,

46
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,480
could you make me

47
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:05,840
the number one beauty

48
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,680
in the sequel?

49
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:10,720
Can you make me
the supreme martial artist?

50
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,600
I want to have eight wives in the sequel

51
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,520
since I've never married in real life.

52
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:16,880
I don't need anything special,

53
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,280
just make me filthy rich.

54
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:20,560
Just make me the sect leader
in the sequel.

55
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,490
I'd be satisfied being the emperor
in the sequel.

56
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,120
(All you need to do
is lure Xiao Ziqi to a secluded spot.)

57
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:38,600
(Someone will take care of the rest.)

58
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,360
(Why don't I just trick him)

59
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:47,450
(by saying I want to talk to him
about how to write the sequel?)

60
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,440
(I'll do it.)

61
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,560
(Any more suggestions,)

62
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:58,590
(I'll abandon writing.)

63
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:06,240
Alright.

64
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,800
I've finished the first volume
of the sequel.

65
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,440
I need your help to review it.

66
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:12,880
Let's hear it.

67
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,360
Changliu Mountain had been
occupied by villains.

68
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,160
The original sect leader,

69
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,680
the one standing behind me,

70
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,840
went into hiding
and honed her skills

71
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:27,840
after surviving a near-death experience.

72
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,400
She eventually defeated the villains

73
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,360
and reclaimed Changliu Mountain.

74
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:33,080
Good.

75
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:34,780
You've tied up the loose ends nicely.

76
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,240
Well written. Just keep writing.

77
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:40,280
From now on, our Changliu Sect
will be known

78
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:43,480
as a righteous and noble sect.

79
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:44,920
And I'll be

80
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,280
the lovable heroine admired by all,

81
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,600
roaming the world

82
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,960
with my sword.

83
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,920
- Yes, exactly.
- Yes.

84
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:54,720
Great minds think alike.

85
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,960
We think alike.

86
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:25,300
(Half a month later)

87
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,480
Have you heard?

88
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,840
The Changliu Sect
isn't an evil sect after all.

89
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,720
It was just occupied by villains.

90
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:32,690
Recently, their sect leader
drove out the villains

91
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:33,840
and reclaimed the sect.

92
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,400
The new chapter
of "Chronicles of Changliu", right?

93
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,720
Oh, I've already heard about it.
I knew it.

94
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:42,600
With such great feng shui,
there's no way Changliu Mountain

95
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,280
could produce an evil sect.

96
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,400
Exactly.

97
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,040
I told you, the wedding wasn't in vain.

98
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:49,920
Changliu Sect's luck
is finally turning around.

99
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:52,160
So, should we perform a few more times?

100
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,640
Maybe our luck will reach the heavens.

101
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:54,840
No way.

102
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,120
When the moon is full, it wanes.

103
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:59,560
It's best not to push our luck too far.

104
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:00,960
Alright.

105
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:03,400
Well, since our luck is good right now,

106
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:05,200
we should recruit
new disciples tomorrow.

107
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:07,790
It's been a long time
since we last recruited.

108
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,520
My father would be
very pleased to know this.

109
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:13,920
Recruit more handsome men.

110
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:22,140
(Treasures of Changliu Mountain)

111
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:23,920
Five taels of silver.

112
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,280
This is top-quality goods.

113
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,160
Five taels of silver.

114
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,560
How much is this?

115
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:34,840
What do you want?

116
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:35,880
Lingzhi mushroom?

117
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:36,680
Wait a moment.

118
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:38,560
Here,

119
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:39,200
take it.

120
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:42,000
New stock will arrive tomorrow.

121
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,160
Everyone, please be patient.

122
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,720
There's plenty for everyone.

123
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,480
Alright.

124
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,720
What catches your eye?

125
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:56,920
- Master Xiao.
- Monkey wine, huh?

126
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:57,800
I have

127
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,280
a favor to ask.

128
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:00,800
Please, go ahead.

129
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,040
Well,

130
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:02,720
we've

131
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,240
leased out

132
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,400
a storefront for a restaurant.

133
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:08,580
But it's been several months
and we haven't received any rent.

134
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,600
I'm not very good at accounting,

135
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,720
so I was hoping you could

136
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:12,920
help me to check it out.

137
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,800
It's not far from here.

138
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:18,000
(He must be up to something.
I'll go see.)

139
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:19,040
Alright,

140
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,480
let's make it quick.

141
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,280
Thank you.

142
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,400
You're welcome.

143
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:27,960
Well...

144
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,520
This place is empty.

145
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:30,400
Did they run away?

146
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:35,800
Oh,

147
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,800
such a handsome young man.

148
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:40,560
Girls, come out and greet our guest.

149
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:43,680
- Master.
- Master.

150
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:46,760
- Master.
- Master.

151
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,920
Liu, this restaurant
seems a bit odd.

152
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:49,720
Liu.

153
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:50,400
Hey.

154
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,480
Is it?

155
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:54,160
It just has a few more girls
than the average restaurant, right?

156
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,120
Yes, there's something rather odd.

157
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,040
Look at me.

158
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,080
Liu.

159
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:04,480
Master,

160
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:07,720
have a drink and take your time.

161
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,720
Yes.

162
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:10,800
Tell me.

163
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,480
Let's have a drink.

164
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:14,200
Who sent you?

165
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,280
Liu Yimei or Bai Minmin?

166
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:17,760
(Ruyi, prostitute)
Who sent us?

167
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:20,440
Our mother told us to serve you well.

168
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:21,840
Sorry, but I don't need it.

169
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:26,640
- Master, where are you going?
- Don't go!

170
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,800
Girls, please behave.

171
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,280
I'm already married.

172
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,320
What is it?

173
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,280
Xiao Ziqi, you've grown bold!

174
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:40,280
I can explain.

175
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,360
Stop touching him.

176
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:44,960
I...

177
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,320
I was only doing business
for a little while

178
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,290
and you ended up in a place
like that with Liu Yimei.

179
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,880
If Xuefu hadn't told me you were gone,

180
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:55,460
I would've...

181
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:56,960
Were you planning to spend the night

182
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:57,960
with that girl?

183
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,840
I thought you were a gentleman,

184
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,480
but you acted so disgracefully.

185
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:07,320
Alright, don't be mad.

186
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:08,960
It'll hurt your liver.

187
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:14,400
Even though our marriage is a sham,

188
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,360
in the eyes of others,

189
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:16,960
we've only just married.

190
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:18,280
You see,

191
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,380
you did something like this.

192
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:20,320
How am I supposed

193
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,760
to hold my head up as sect leader?

194
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,600
Did you find me so quickly

195
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:25,800
because you saw
the red beans I scattered?

196
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,320
So it was you who did that?

197
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:35,680
No wonder.

198
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,160
I was wondering who wasted

199
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,800
all those red beans from our shop.

200
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,840
But it's your Brother Liu

201
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:43,560
who's acting strange.

202
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,160
Indeed.

203
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:48,080
But why are you
suddenly so close to him?

204
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:50,000
Well...

205
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:50,840
Lipei.

206
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,200
Lipei.

207
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,280
Lipei.

208
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,360
There's someone new at the entrance.

209
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,800
He came for your reputation

210
00:09:58,800 --> 00:09:59,800
and insisted on meeting you.

211
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:00,800
And he's handsome.

212
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:01,520
Really?

213
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:02,000
Yes.

214
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,120
