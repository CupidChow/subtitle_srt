9
00:00:59,710 --> 00:01:00,520
Originally, I thought

10
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,480
this hunting would
play to Ziyi's strengths.

11
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:04,520
But unexpectedly,

12
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:06,720
Ziqi has taken the victory.

13
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:09,680
It's indeed

14
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:11,240
a pleasant surprise for me.

15
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:12,040
Yes,

16
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:14,520
my brother has hidden depths.

17
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:18,520
As per the usual tradition,

18
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:20,960
the winner is granted a request.

19
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:22,800
Ziqi.

20
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:29,360
Father.

21
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:30,520
Tell us,

22
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,120
what do you want?

23
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:36,720
I'd like to request something
for the 392 children

24
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:38,260
of the city's orphanage.

25
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:40,840
Xiao Ziqi, you...

26
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:42,520
Oh?

27
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:44,520
What do you mean by that?

28
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:57,240
This child grew up in the orphanage,

29
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,280
but from the time he could walk,

30
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:01,240
he was repeatedly sold
to the beggar gang.

31
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:03,390
Every day, he was forced
to beg in the streets.

32
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,040
If he didn't collect enough money,

33
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:06,600
he was either starved

34
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:07,880
or beaten severely.

35
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,440
Is that true?

36
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,240
What a poor child.

37
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:16,880
According to him,

38
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:18,480
all his friends in the orphanage

39
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,800
grew up enduring the same treatment.

40
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:23,400
When they become older,
they'll be sold off to brothels

41
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,360
or into servitude.

42
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,520
Can this be verified?

43
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,400
How could we believe the words
of a mere concubine and a beggar?

44
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:39,600
Father,

45
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,000
I've already compiled

46
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,960
all the financial records
of the orphanage

47
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,040
and uncovered dozens
of corrupt officials.

48
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:50,080
The evidence also implicates people

49
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,880
from brokers, beggar gang to brothels.

50
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:53,400
Please make your judgment.

51
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:54,800
Bring it forth.

52
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,320
Ah, Minister Wang!

53
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,880
I've spent decades establishing

54
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:18,720
this orphanage

55
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:21,320
in the hopes of eradicating hunger

56
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:24,760
and ensuring no more children
suffer poverty.

57
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:25,600
But now,

58
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:28,800
you have trampled
on the future of Yongzhou!

59
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,040
My Lord.

60
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,240
Please be discerning.

61
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,480
The Wang family has served you
for years.

62
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:35,400
Our...

63
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,520
Our devotion is beyond question!

64
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:38,960
I merely uttered

65
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,920
a few words about
Senior Master's concubine

66
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:42,560
and now he accuses us of such crimes.

67
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,320
Relying on Ziqi's words alone

68
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:50,600
seems unjust.

69
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:52,440
Why not

70
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,160
conduct a thorough investigation

71
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:55,880
before making any decisions?

72
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:02,960
Father, during today's hunt,

73
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,200
I captured something special.

74
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:06,600
Perhaps you'd like to take a look.

75
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:18,800
Baby?

76
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:21,480
Why do you have my Baby?

77
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:23,880
Xiao Ziqi,

78
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,800
you stole him from me!

79
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,360
So this noisy, stupid bird

80
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,560
is yours?

81
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,040
You dare to challenge the Wang family?

82
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,040
This foolish City Lord

83
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,560
will soon be forced to step down.

84
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:36,360
Step down!

85
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,640
Make him step down!

86
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:39,520
You...

87
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:41,720
Minister Wang!

88
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,000
Well,

89
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,680
I should go back to my room now.

90
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:54,280
Hey.

91
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:55,760
What's wrong?

92
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,120
Ziyi is coming back to my place today.

93
00:04:58,680 --> 00:04:59,360
We...

94
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:02,120
Ziqi,

95
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:03,760
where am I sleeping tonight?

96
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:05,120
Oh,

97
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,320
Father asked me to stay here.

98
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:08,720
After what happened today,

99
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,000
Minister Wang may seek revenge.

100
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:11,560
His residence

101
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:12,960
is close by.

102
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,480
If he tries anything,

103
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:16,520
I'll be here

104
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:17,200
to protect you.

105
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:19,400
Don't worry.

106
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:20,240
I'll be fine.

107
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,370
You should go back.

108
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:23,640
If you're sure,

109
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:25,320
I'll head back then.

110
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:27,160
Get some rest.

111
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:28,280
OK.

112
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,800
(This isn't the first time
we've shared a bed.)

113
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,440
(Why are you so nervous?)

114
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,000
Thank you.

115
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,480
Oh, no problem.

116
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,520
Back on Changliu Mountain,

117
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,400
didn't you often help me out?

118
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,040
I meant the matter with the orphanage.

119
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:16,840
Thank you

120
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:19,080
for speaking up for me in court today.

121
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,480
I should be thanking you.

122
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,600
Those little beggars

123
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,680
won't have to live in fear anymore.

124
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:30,000
I said it before,

125
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
we're a couple.

126
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,720
Your matters are my matters.

127
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,160
Besides, you happened

128
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:37,240
to help me fulfill an old wish,

129
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:41,120
weakening the Wang family's
influence in the city.

130
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,920
I actually wasted a good opportunity.

131
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,440
I had planned to ask

132
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,800
my father for our marriage today...

If we don't come up with an idea,

00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,480
our Wang family will be finished.

143
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:39,120
You only have yourself to blame

144
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:41,360
for getting caught.

145
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,560
Great.

146
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:46,720
Our family's in decline

147
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:50,080
and you're here to kick us
while we're down!

148
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:57,360
There's...

149
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,200
poison

150
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,880
in the tea!

151
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:07,360
(Right now, I don't have any allies
inside Yongzhou.)

152
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,400
(If I want to succeed,)

153
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:12,440
(I'll have to rely
on that person from Changliu.)

154
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,160
Such trouble.

155
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,720
I even have to help you get dressed.

156
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:23,840
Keep your voice down.

157
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:24,880
Don't let Ziyi hear.

158
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:30,800
Today I have many matters

159
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,000
to attend to in the city,

160
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,280
so I might return late.

161
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:35,960
If you're bored,

162
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,520
have Sancai take you for a walk.

163
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:38,840
But be back before sunset.

164
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:41,280
The way you say that,

165
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:42,120
it's like

166
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:44,320
I'm some delicate lady who can't fight

167
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,840
and might be abducted at any moment.

168
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:46,800
True.

169
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:47,560
You demon,

170
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:48,520
you kidnap others.

171
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:50,080
Who would dare touch you,

172
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:50,520
right?

173
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,960
You still hold a grudge.

174
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,080
Tell me,

175
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:57,200
how can we resolve this?

176
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:58,440
Well,

177
00:08:58,640 --> 00:08:59,760
such a great grudge,

178
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:02,200
I suppose you should offer yourself.

179
00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:07,360
You should consider it.

180
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:09,080
I'm frail,

181
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,000
but

182
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,240
my feelings for you run deep.

183
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:16,640
No wonder Ziyi said your words
are very deceitful.

184
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:19,000
You'd even say something
so embarrassing.

185
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:19,760
Hey,

186
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,920
I swear

187
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:22,800
I didn't lie.

188
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:26,920
Ziqi,

189
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:28,400
why aren't you ready yet?

190
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:30,560
You...

191
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:33,480
You two...

192
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:35,320
I...

193
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:39,560
Come on,

194
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,120
I don't understand what I've done

195
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,600
to deserve this every day.

196
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:44,280
If you don't go,

197
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,560
Officer Sun will come for you.

198
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:54,120
You won first place in the competition.

199
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,360
I still owe you a reward.

200
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:57,320
Tell me,

201
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:58,480
what do you want?

202
00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:00,480
Father, you've already rewarded me.

203
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:03,760
That was for the people.

204
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:04,480
This time,

205
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,120
you can ask for something for yourself.

206
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:07,120
How about

207
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:10,200
I'll grant you a marriage
with Princess?

208
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:11,520
Father,

209
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:14,960
I've already married Lipei
at Changliu Mountain.

210
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,440
I won't take another wife
in this lifetime.

211
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:18,640
Nonsense!

212
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:20,920
She's just a savage girl.

213
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:24,840
Alas,

214
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,880
if you really love her,

215
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,120
then after marrying Princess,

216
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:31,720
I'll make an exception

217
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,840
and grant her to be your concubine.

218
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:35,720
Is that acceptable?

219
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:36,760
Father,

220
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,840
it's not what I seek.

221
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:39,400
You...

222
00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:41,690
I seek a lifelong commitment to a girl.

223
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,520
We'll discuss this matter later.

224
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:46,400
Yesterday, the Princess said

225
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:48,140
she admired your musical skills.

226
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,120
Why not

227
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,520
stay here today with Princess

228
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:53,200
and also spend time with me?

229
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:53,960
I...

230
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:54,720
What?

231
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,000
Do you

232
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:58,360
find it difficult to stay
and fulfill your filial duty?

233
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,240
That's not what I meant.

234
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,000
Then stay put

235
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:04,720
and don't let your mind wander.

236
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:05,560
Hmph.

00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:32,680
I'm frail,

242
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:33,680
but

243
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:36,040
my feelings for you run deep.

244
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,560
Master,

245
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:46,360
once I revive Changliu, I'll marry you.

246
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:49,360
Then, we'll have
a grand wedding ceremony,

247
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,720
making you

248
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:53,360
the most honored groom of Changliu Sect.

249
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:58,680
But...

250
00:11:58,680 --> 00:11:59,800
I have the position

251
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:02,000
of City Lord to inherit.

252
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:05,000

have to give up being the sect leader

256
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,520
and marry into your family instead?

257
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,600
Once I marry Master Ziqi,

258
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,320
we can be together every day.

259
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:20,920

00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:23,440
you and I will both be his wives.

261
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:25,680
The three of us will live
in perfect harmony.

262
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:26,620
That would be wonderful.

263
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:28,080
No, no way.

264
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,280
This won't do!

265
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:31,280
Madam,

266
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:34,080
someone came to our shop
and smashed everything.

267
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,480
How could this happen?
