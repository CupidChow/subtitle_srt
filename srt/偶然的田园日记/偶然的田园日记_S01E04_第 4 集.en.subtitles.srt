1
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:52,969
Good morning.

2
00:00:54,179 --> 00:00:55,263
Where did he go?

3
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:58,016
Ja-young is off today.

4
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:00,393
Pardon?

5
00:01:00,477 --> 00:01:03,271
She took him out for a walk this morning.

6
00:01:03,354 --> 00:01:05,106
She wanted to, so I let her.

7
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:06,900
He seemed to need some fresh air.

8
00:01:06,983 --> 00:01:10,320
She took a half-wild dog out for a walk?

9
00:01:10,403 --> 00:01:13,031
What if she loses her grip on the leash?

10
00:01:14,032 --> 00:01:15,450
There she is.

11
00:01:16,201 --> 00:01:17,285
Hello.

12
00:01:17,952 --> 00:01:19,287
Right.

13
00:01:19,788 --> 00:01:22,165
Here, you should say hi, too.

14
00:01:22,248 --> 00:01:24,209
"Hello."

15
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:29,714
Hey, can I show you something fun?

16
00:01:33,218 --> 00:01:35,428
Just like you did earlier, okay?

17
00:01:38,264 --> 00:01:39,098
All right.

18
00:01:47,065 --> 00:01:49,901
Over there! Why aren't you going?

19
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:53,404
You did it earlier.
Why won't you go get it?

20
00:01:57,659 --> 00:01:58,493
Darn it.

21
00:02:05,416 --> 00:02:06,417
Gosh.

22
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:14,467
Why didn't you go after it?

23
00:02:17,095 --> 00:02:20,348
Nurungji, why didn't you go fetch?
You did so well earlier.

24
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:21,933
Here.

25
00:02:22,517 --> 00:02:24,435
His leg seems all better now.

26
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:26,521
You're not keeping him
at the hospital forever, are you?

27
00:02:26,604 --> 00:02:30,233
I shouldn't keep him in that cage anymore.
I'll find someone to adopt him.

28
00:02:31,234 --> 00:02:33,236
Should I adopt him then?

29
00:02:34,237 --> 00:02:36,364
-What?
-I have a fairly regular work schedule,

30
00:02:36,447 --> 00:02:39,159
and I don't have
any other family members to worry about.

31
00:02:39,868 --> 00:02:43,705
Oh, and it was a long time ago,
but I do have experience raising a dog.

32
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:47,000
What?

33
00:02:47,584 --> 00:02:50,420
Oh, were you uncomfortable?

34
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:53,047
You were uncomfortable, weren't you?

35
00:02:56,968 --> 00:02:58,219
Let me adopt him.

36
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:01,389
But while you're here,

37
00:03:01,472 --> 00:03:04,517
you provide the food
and medicine for free. Deal?

38
00:03:05,977 --> 00:03:07,020
Come here.

39
00:03:07,604 --> 00:03:08,688
Goodness.

40
00:03:09,606 --> 00:03:13,067
"Ja-young will take good care of me.
Is it a deal?"

41
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:37,884
All right, it's ready.

42
00:03:40,637 --> 00:03:41,512
Here.

43
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:49,103
Go on in.

44
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:51,231
Try it.

45
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:53,942
You don't want to?

46
00:03:55,526 --> 00:03:59,197
That's okay.
You just need some time to adjust, right?

47
00:04:05,119 --> 00:04:05,995
A puppy?

48
00:04:09,707 --> 00:04:10,875
You're giving it to me?

49
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:15,004
Thanks! It's so pretty. So cute!

50
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:16,339
Hi.

51
00:04:17,048 --> 00:04:18,132
It's so pretty.

52
00:04:19,008 --> 00:04:20,426
What's its name, by the way?

53
00:04:24,138 --> 00:04:25,056
Really?

54
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:27,141
In that case,

55
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:29,519
let's call it Cloud. How's that?

56
00:04:31,354 --> 00:04:35,608
You like that, Cloud?
Cloud, I know you like it, too.

57
00:04:36,192 --> 00:04:37,277
You're so cute.

58
00:04:41,656 --> 00:04:44,450
Cloud is gone, and you're here now.

59
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:47,287
Is she just an animal person?

60
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:51,916
I guess Ja-young is an animal person.

61
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,252
She makes friends with them
before you know it.

62
00:04:54,335 --> 00:04:57,964
But then again, she makes friends easily
with people and animals alike.

63
00:04:58,631 --> 00:05:00,091
It's a skill, really.

64
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:05,179
-What is that?
-She gave it to me, so I pinned it on.

65
00:05:05,763 --> 00:05:08,516
Such a pretty little flower, isn't it?
So cute.

66
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:10,935
HAN DEOK-JIN VETERINARY HOSPITAL

67
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:15,273
I'll see you later.

68
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:30,204
JEON SEON-MI HAIR SALON

69
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:54,395
Hello.

70
00:05:58,816 --> 00:06:00,151
Have you eaten yet?

71
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:02,945
-Yes.
-This place is really good too.

72
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:04,655
You should try it next time.

73
00:06:04,739 --> 00:06:05,740
Okay.

74
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:07,450
-Hello, doctor.
-How are you?

75
00:06:08,117 --> 00:06:10,036
We just finished eating. Have you eaten?

76
00:06:10,119 --> 00:06:11,704
Yes, I just ate.

77
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:14,123
We should grab a bite to break the ice.

78
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:17,126
Let's eat together sometime.
It'll be my treat.

79
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:18,503
Sure.

80
00:06:20,546 --> 00:06:21,422
Okay.

81
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:23,257
Hello, sir.

82
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:25,635
I see.

83
00:06:26,511 --> 00:06:27,845
Okay, I understand, yes.

84
00:06:29,305 --> 00:06:33,059
It's the gamjatang restaurant.
There's a drunk customer making a scene.

85
00:06:33,643 --> 00:06:36,020
I'll swing by there, so you all head back.

86
00:06:36,104 --> 00:06:39,023
In broad daylight?
All right, hurry over then.

87
00:06:39,565 --> 00:06:40,399
Just a moment.

88
00:06:42,401 --> 00:06:43,236
She's busy.

89
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:45,279
-Yes.
-She's the busiest in our village.

90
00:06:47,323 --> 00:06:48,574
Oh, really?

91
00:06:48,658 --> 00:06:50,993
Okay, I'll be right there.

92
00:06:52,036 --> 00:06:53,371
It's Ms. Jang.

93
00:06:53,454 --> 00:06:56,207
She caught some teenagers
smoking in front of her house,

94
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:57,500
so she wants me to come.

95
00:06:58,292 --> 00:07:00,044
Perhaps you and Sergeant Yoon can--

96
00:07:00,128 --> 00:07:03,506
Let's go deal with the drunk customer
at the restaurant. That'd be better.

97
00:07:04,006 --> 00:07:05,383
Give them a decent scare.

98
00:07:05,466 --> 00:07:07,176
You have a good day, doctor.

99
00:07:07,844 --> 00:07:09,011
Let's do lunch next time.

100
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:10,388
-Why me…
-Hurry up.

101
00:07:10,471 --> 00:07:11,973
Why are you taking me…

102
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:23,276
Oh, really?

103
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:25,903
Okay.

104
00:07:25,987 --> 00:07:27,238
Good job, Auntie.

105
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:28,781
Okay.

106
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:32,410
She ran into one of their moms

107
00:07:32,493 --> 00:07:34,871
and his mom spanked him 100 times
and dragged him home.

108
00:07:35,621 --> 00:07:37,874
What are the odds
of running into her right there?

109
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:40,918
Chief will regret swapping tasks with me.

110
00:07:42,753 --> 00:07:45,506
I have to say, you really are very busy.

111
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:48,176
I like that I'm busy.

112
00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:50,678
The fact that so many people need me

113
00:07:50,761 --> 00:07:53,431
must mean that I'm a useful person.

114
00:07:54,348 --> 00:07:55,683
And I like that.

115
00:07:56,684 --> 00:08:00,146
Sang-hyeon always says
that I just want attention.

116
00:08:00,229 --> 00:08:02,106
He's one to talk.

117
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:04,275
He's quite needy himself.

118
00:08:07,236 --> 00:08:08,404
It must be nice.

119
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:12,575
That Mr. Lee seems to
care a lot about you.

120
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:18,331
We did grow up together since birth.

121
00:08:19,081 --> 00:08:21,542
And we'll probably see each other
until we die.

122
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,131
You don't have any friends, do you?

123
00:08:28,799 --> 00:08:29,967
What's with the reaction?

124
00:08:32,887 --> 00:08:34,931
Do you really not? I'm so sorry.

125
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:39,977
It must be boring
being out in the countryside

126
00:08:40,061 --> 00:08:41,354
without a single friend.

127
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:46,776
-I do have friends.
-But you don't have one here.

128
00:08:47,652 --> 00:08:48,486
No, wait.

129
00:08:49,987 --> 00:08:50,821
Maybe you do.

130
00:08:53,824 --> 00:08:57,036
I'm too busy to have time to be bored.

131
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:01,332
Don't you miss your girlfriend?

132
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:04,293
You said you had a girlfriend.

133
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:11,384
Well, you can't get together
whenever you miss someone.

134
00:09:13,135 --> 00:09:14,595
I guess that's true.

135
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:18,266
Being able to see someone
whenever you miss them

136
00:09:18,349 --> 00:09:20,476
would be a tremendous blessing.

137
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:22,353
Whoever it may be.

138
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:30,653
What's wrong?

139
00:09:30,736 --> 00:09:32,905
Did I just sound like a moody teenager?

140
00:09:34,323 --> 00:09:35,157
Not at all.

141
00:09:38,536 --> 00:09:41,956
-How's the dog doing?
-Nurungji? He's doing well.

142
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:45,334
He has a name now.
Please call him Nurungji from now on.

143
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:46,586
What?

144
00:09:47,336 --> 00:09:48,170
Isn't it cute?

145
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:49,338
Nurungji?

146
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:50,423
Nurungji?

147
00:10:02,643 --> 00:10:04,395
Hi! Where are you going?

148
00:10:08,232 --> 00:10:09,525
Why aren't you driving your new truck?

149
00:10:12,528 --> 00:10:14,155
He's on his way back after lunch.

150
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:17,575
-Going out to buy something?
-Mating disrupter.

151
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:20,661
Do you know what that is?

152
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:23,664
Could it be something
that disrupts mating?

153
00:10:24,248 --> 00:10:25,374
Some kind of pheromone?

154
00:10:26,334 --> 00:10:27,543
You know your stuff.

155
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:36,260
There are these bugs called peach moths.

156
00:10:36,344 --> 00:10:38,763
It's the worst kind of evil
that destroys peaches.

157
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,058
So I use strong pheromones

158
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:45,519
to disrupt their mating
and prevent them from laying eggs.

159
00:10:46,228 --> 00:10:49,357
But from their perspective,
it must be a very frustrating situation.

160
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,610
I've been empathizing with them lately,
you know?

161
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:56,822
Someone's getting in the way
of their romance.

162
00:11:05,414 --> 00:11:08,376
Hey, are you having a heatstroke?
What's wrong with you?

163
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:10,753
It's just a thought that passed my mind.

164
00:11:10,836 --> 00:11:12,797
I've never felt that way before,
but I do lately.

165
00:11:14,757 --> 00:11:16,008
Bye.

166
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:16,926
Hey!

167
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:38,697
Is his work that stressful?
I wonder why he's acting like that.

168
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:44,995
Man, it's hot.

169
00:11:50,751 --> 00:11:53,379
HAN DEOK-JIN VETERINARY HOSPITAL

170
00:11:53,462 --> 00:11:56,340
Looks like I should visit
the Hwajeong City barn tomorrow.

171
00:11:56,424 --> 00:11:57,925
They already called, actually.

172
00:11:58,008 --> 00:11:58,926
Wait, that's…

173
00:11:59,718 --> 00:12:00,553
It's mine.

174
00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:02,805
Oh, my gosh.

175
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:05,182
My goodness.

176
00:12:06,684 --> 00:12:09,145
But I thought you didn't drink
instant coffee.

177
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:10,271
How come you're drinking it?

178
00:12:11,313 --> 00:12:15,109
I guess I was just craving
something sweet today.

179
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:22,241
Are you having trouble
with your love life?

180
00:12:22,324 --> 00:12:23,784
I can tell from your face.

181
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:26,203
It's nothing like that.

182
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:32,960
-Did he not come here?
-Who?

183
00:12:33,794 --> 00:12:35,963
Nurungji.

184
00:12:36,046 --> 00:12:38,591
He didn't. Has he gone missing?

185
00:12:39,633 --> 00:12:42,011
I went home to feed him,

186
00:12:42,094 --> 00:12:43,888
but he wasn't there. Just his leash.

187
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:47,725
You said he was adjusting well
just a few days ago.

188
00:12:47,808 --> 00:12:48,934
Did you look nearby?

189
00:12:49,518 --> 00:12:52,188
Yes. Do you think he'll come back?

190
00:12:52,855 --> 00:12:54,398
What if he doesn't?

191
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:57,443
What if he gets caught
hunting a chicken somewhere?

192
00:12:57,526 --> 00:12:58,569
Darn it.

193
00:12:58,652 --> 00:13:00,070
Calm down first.

194
00:13:00,154 --> 00:13:03,616
If he ran while you went into town,
he couldn't have gone far,

195
00:13:03,699 --> 00:13:05,493
so let's search around your house more.

196
00:13:07,703 --> 00:13:10,915
There are narrow alleyways.
You'd be better off on your bike.

197
00:13:10,998 --> 00:13:12,166
I see.

198
00:13:12,249 --> 00:13:14,460
Call me if you need me.
I'll go look for him.

199
00:13:14,543 --> 00:13:15,836
Yes, okay.

200
00:13:16,921 --> 00:13:17,796
Oh, my gosh.

201
00:13:18,797 --> 00:13:19,840
Nurungji.

202
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:22,343
Nurungji.

203
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:23,969
Nurungji.

204
00:13:24,053 --> 00:13:25,346
Nurungji.

205
00:13:25,429 --> 00:13:26,430
Nurungji.

206
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:31,435
Nurungji.

207
00:13:32,728 --> 00:13:34,021
Nurungji.

208
00:13:34,104 --> 00:13:35,022
Nurungji.

209
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:39,485
-Nurungji.
-Nurungji.

210
00:13:40,694 --> 00:13:41,570
Nurungji.

211
00:13:44,865 --> 00:13:47,952
I'll go this way. You look over there.

212
00:13:48,035 --> 00:13:48,911
Okay.

213
00:13:50,579 --> 00:13:51,622
Nurungji.

214
00:13:52,248 --> 00:13:53,165
Nurungji.

215
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:56,877
Nurungji.

216
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:58,879
Nurungji.

217
00:14:00,464 --> 00:14:01,340
Nurungji.

218
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:03,509
Nurungji.

219
00:14:04,635 --> 00:14:05,719
Where did he go?

220
00:14:06,387 --> 00:14:07,221
Nurungji.

221
00:14:08,305 --> 00:14:09,181
Nurungji.

222
00:14:09,932 --> 00:14:10,891
Go look over there.

223
00:14:10,975 --> 00:14:12,393
-Okay.
-I'll call you if I find him.

224
00:14:14,395 --> 00:14:15,271
Nurungji.

225
00:14:15,896 --> 00:14:16,855
Nurungji.

226
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:25,531
Auntie, have you seen a puppy
about this big?

227
00:14:25,614 --> 00:14:27,324
No, I haven't.

228
00:14:27,408 --> 00:14:28,409
Okay.

229
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:30,077
Nurungji.

230
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,788
-Nurungji.
-Nurungji.

231
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:33,873
Nurungji!

232
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:49,346
Hey, Nurungji!

233
00:14:52,641 --> 00:14:54,643
Nurungji. Wait.

234
00:14:55,477 --> 00:14:57,563
Nurungji! Hey, wait!

235
00:15:00,107 --> 00:15:01,066
Wait!

236
00:15:06,614 --> 00:15:08,782
Nurungji!

237
00:15:20,294 --> 00:15:21,170
You were a dad?

238
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:31,764
Boksil!

239
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:34,725
Boksil?

240
00:15:34,808 --> 00:15:36,143
Good girl.

241
00:15:36,852 --> 00:15:39,146
No. Over here, Boksil.

242
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:43,817
No!

243
00:16:04,672 --> 00:16:05,756
What do we do?

244
00:16:06,548 --> 00:16:07,883
I can't find your contact.

245
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:11,679
You'd need eagle eyes to find it.

246
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:14,306
Let's stop looking.

247
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:16,934
Even if we find it,
I can't put it back on right away.

248
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:18,852
Plus, it was pretty old.

249
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:20,646
But still…

250
00:16:24,108 --> 00:16:26,694
How's your arm? Does it hurt a lot?

251
00:16:29,697 --> 00:16:31,657
I think I scratched it a little
when I fell.

252
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:34,451
-It's nothing.
-This isn't nothing.

253
00:16:36,161 --> 00:16:38,247
We can't leave it be. Let's go back.

254
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:40,582
Whether you go to a hospital
or treat it yourself,

255
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:41,917
we should get back to town.

256
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:49,174
Grab this and follow me, okay?

257
00:16:57,391 --> 00:17:01,061
Boksil came to our village this spring.

258
00:17:01,979 --> 00:17:05,649
She was a stray dog until Aunt Gang-hwa
took her home and started raising her.

259
00:17:06,316 --> 00:17:09,820
I thought she was adjusting well,
but I guess that wasn't the case.

260
00:17:10,446 --> 00:17:13,032
Seeing how she had puppies
in secret like that.

261
00:17:15,409 --> 00:17:16,535
Hold on.

262
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:20,289
How long have those two been together?

263
00:17:20,914 --> 00:17:24,334
Well, canine pregnancy is
a little over two months…

264
00:17:25,002 --> 00:17:26,628
So for at least that long.

265
00:17:27,421 --> 00:17:28,464
Oh, really?

266
00:17:30,257 --> 00:17:31,258
Wow.

267
00:17:31,925 --> 00:17:34,094
I mean, Aunt Gang-hwa did find it weird

268
00:17:34,178 --> 00:17:37,639
that she found hair in Boksil's poop.

269
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,517
Hey, Nurungji.

270
00:17:41,101 --> 00:17:43,979
You weren't eating those chickens
by yourself, were you?

271
00:17:44,772 --> 00:17:46,315
You're pretty loyal to your mate.

272
00:17:47,983 --> 00:17:50,694
You really know all kinds of things,
Officer Ahn.

273
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:55,616
You think I'm super nosy, don't you?

274
00:17:56,700 --> 00:18:00,120
I mean, I didn't use those exact words.

275
00:18:00,829 --> 00:18:02,748
I can hear you thinking it.

276
00:18:06,376 --> 00:18:08,128
I do find it kind of fascinating.

277
00:18:08,879 --> 00:18:10,964
Even for a small village resident,

278
00:18:11,048 --> 00:18:12,716
you know so much about everyone

279
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,009
and you're so friendly to them.

280
00:18:14,802 --> 00:18:16,720
And they're not even your family.

281
00:18:19,807 --> 00:18:21,016
I think of them as family.

282
00:18:22,184 --> 00:18:26,146
I genuinely feel like
everyone in this village is my family.

283
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:30,859
When I was a kid, I suddenly found myself
living alone with my grandmother.

284
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:39,827
Anyway, they've given me so much,
so I owe them.

285
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:41,495
No one grows up alone, you know?

286
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:48,252
But do you think
the puppies will be okay there?

287
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:52,214
It seems Boksil has been
taking good care of them.

288
00:18:52,297 --> 00:18:54,633
They are plump and have clean fur.

289
00:18:54,716 --> 00:18:59,221
But it's still dangerous to live out here,
so we should relocate them soon.

290
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:10,941
By the way…

291
00:19:12,484 --> 00:19:13,777
Are you sure you can't see well right now?

292
00:19:15,404 --> 00:19:16,405
Yes.

293
00:19:18,907 --> 00:19:20,284
That's a relief.

294
00:19:20,784 --> 00:19:23,245
I'm not wearing any makeup
and I'm totally sweaty.

295
00:19:25,789 --> 00:19:27,875
Well, that makes two of us.

296
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:30,836
Actually, I'd say you're in
much worse shape.

297
00:19:36,758 --> 00:19:37,759
You got one here too.

298
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:45,017
Let's go.

299
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:48,729
Let's go, Nurungji.

300
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:56,862
Hello?

301
00:19:58,488 --> 00:19:59,323
Yes.

302
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:03,493
Okay, I'll be right there.

303
00:20:04,578 --> 00:20:06,580
What's wrong? Is it something urgent?

304
00:20:06,663 --> 00:20:08,665
It was the Women's Association president.

305
00:20:08,749 --> 00:20:10,500
Her cow is having trouble giving birth.

306
00:20:11,001 --> 00:20:11,877
I see.

307
00:20:13,086 --> 00:20:16,215
Then we'll need a pulley for the delivery.

308
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:20,677
There's one shared by everyone,
but I don't know where it is right now.

309
00:20:23,096 --> 00:20:25,807
But we have a bigger problem.

310
00:20:26,683 --> 00:20:28,977
You can't see properly.
Are you going to be okay?

311
00:20:31,521 --> 00:20:33,023
What do I do? Seriously.

312
00:20:33,106 --> 00:20:35,609
Why is this happening
when my husband isn't around?

313
00:20:35,692 --> 00:20:37,736
She's been bellowing nonstop for a while.

314
00:20:37,819 --> 00:20:40,781
Don't worry too much.
I'll try to palpate it first.

315
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:44,368
It'll be hard for her
since it's her first delivery.

316
00:20:48,038 --> 00:20:49,164
Where are they?

317
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:52,626
There they are.

318
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:13,105
My gosh, how is it?

319
00:21:13,188 --> 00:21:15,148
The calf's heartbeat is getting weaker.

320
00:21:15,232 --> 00:21:17,943
-This puts the cow in danger as well.
-Then what do we do?

321
00:21:19,486 --> 00:21:20,445
Do you have a pulley?

322
00:21:20,529 --> 00:21:23,490
It's not here.
Should I get it from the village hall?

323
00:21:23,573 --> 00:21:25,158
No, we don't have time.

324
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:27,452
Bring me a long rope, a sturdy one!

325
00:21:27,536 --> 00:21:28,829
Long rope? Got it.

326
00:21:32,749 --> 00:21:33,583
How is it going?

327
00:21:34,543 --> 00:21:36,837
The calf is stuck on the pelvic bone.
I have to pull it out quickly.

328
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,088
Your glasses.

329
00:21:50,684 --> 00:21:51,852
You think it'll be okay?

330
00:22:13,665 --> 00:22:15,625
That won't do. Hold these for me.

331
00:22:16,126 --> 00:22:17,294
You want me to hold these?

332
00:22:20,797 --> 00:22:21,798
But…

333
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:25,510
Could you hold this end, please?

334
00:22:27,262 --> 00:22:30,390
-Okay. One, two, three.
-Two, three.

335
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:32,601
Pull.

336
00:22:35,103 --> 00:22:37,731
-One, two, three.
-Three.

337
00:22:45,614 --> 00:22:47,699
-One, two, three.
-Two, three.

338
00:22:53,663 --> 00:22:56,416
Just a little more!

339
00:23:00,212 --> 00:23:02,631
-It's coming out!
-It's coming. Come on.

340
00:23:02,714 --> 00:23:04,966
-One, two, three.
-Two, three.

341
00:23:06,885 --> 00:23:08,011
-It's out!
-It's out!

342
00:23:08,637 --> 00:23:09,846
-It's out!
-It's out!

343
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:12,182
-We did it!
-It's out!

344
00:23:12,265 --> 00:23:14,643
Oh my gosh. It's out.

345
00:23:15,685 --> 00:23:16,770
Oh, my goodness!

346
00:23:20,107 --> 00:23:20,982
There.

347
00:23:22,818 --> 00:23:26,029
-There.
-Oh, my goodness.

348
00:23:26,655 --> 00:23:28,532
-Just wipe down its head.
-Okay.

349
00:23:28,615 --> 00:23:29,658
You did well.

350
00:23:30,325 --> 00:23:33,203
Oh, my goodness. What in the world?

351
00:23:33,286 --> 00:23:35,372
Are you sure this was your first time?

352
00:23:36,289 --> 00:23:37,499
I know, right?

353
00:23:37,582 --> 00:23:39,918
On such a difficult delivery
with no pulley…

354
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:43,380
Ja-young, you did a great job
fetching his glasses

355
00:23:43,463 --> 00:23:45,799
and assisting him with the delivery.

356
00:23:47,467 --> 00:23:50,846
You two stay for dinner, okay?

357
00:23:50,929 --> 00:23:52,305
Don't you dare turn me down.

358
00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:55,684
Wait. You need hot water, don't you?

359
00:23:55,767 --> 00:23:57,727
I'll be right back, okay?

360
00:24:03,859 --> 00:24:05,026
You're really amazing.

361
00:24:07,362 --> 00:24:08,738
I'm no expert,

362
00:24:09,322 --> 00:24:12,200
but I do know
that it's much more difficult

363
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:15,287
to deal with large animals like this

364
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:17,747
than it is to handle small animals
like cats or dogs.

365
00:24:18,874 --> 00:24:22,252
If I were in your shoes earlier,
I wouldn't have known what to do.

366
00:24:22,335 --> 00:24:24,045
I would have just stood around shaking.

367
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:27,632
That was so cool. I mean it.

368
00:24:29,718 --> 00:24:31,428
I was actually really scared.

369
00:24:32,387 --> 00:24:34,890
Your compliments are helping me relax.

370
00:24:36,016 --> 00:24:37,267
You did great.

371
00:24:41,396 --> 00:24:44,191
Right. You can't clean your glasses
because your hands are dirty.

372
00:24:44,274 --> 00:24:45,400
Here, let me.

373
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:48,987
Here.

374
00:24:51,907 --> 00:24:53,033
There you go.

375
00:24:57,329 --> 00:24:59,372
You're just so cute. Oh, my.

376
00:25:02,792 --> 00:25:07,756
I have something to tell you

377
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:13,887
But why don't I have the courage?

378
00:25:16,348 --> 00:25:21,019
I want to tell you, but I am not confident

379
00:25:21,102 --> 00:25:23,647
So only my heart is beating hard

380
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:27,442
A fool, a fool

381
00:25:27,525 --> 00:25:31,112
I must be a fool

382
00:25:31,196 --> 00:25:34,282
Are you ready?
Go ahead and have a seat over there.

383
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:37,911
I mean, the food was too good
for us to not share.

384
00:25:37,994 --> 00:25:39,204
Hey, watch your head.

385
00:25:39,287 --> 00:25:42,249
So I just called a few people
who live nearby. Here.

386
00:25:42,332 --> 00:25:44,334
A fool, a fool

387
00:25:44,417 --> 00:25:45,460
-Honey.
-Yes?

388
00:25:45,543 --> 00:25:46,795
-This is the vet.
-Oh, doctor.

389
00:25:46,878 --> 00:25:47,712
Have a seat.

390
00:25:47,796 --> 00:25:50,590
Thank you for today.
Here, let me pour you a glass.

391
00:25:53,426 --> 00:25:54,386
Oh, my gosh.

392
00:25:54,469 --> 00:25:55,595
Mr. Hong, get over here!

393
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:57,514
-Oh, come on.
-Okay.

394
00:25:57,597 --> 00:25:59,140
Oh, jeez.

395
00:26:00,976 --> 00:26:03,270
I didn't know
this was such a stylish jacket.

396
00:26:05,105 --> 00:26:07,315
It was something they gave me.

397
00:26:07,899 --> 00:26:09,526
-Does it look weird?
-Oh, no.

398
00:26:10,777 --> 00:26:13,113
Is your arm okay now?

399
00:26:15,115 --> 00:26:15,991
It's fine.

400
00:26:16,908 --> 00:26:20,495
Still, treat it carefully for a few days.
Your hands do such important work.

401
00:26:22,122 --> 00:26:24,374
I guess you're right. Just like today.

402
00:26:25,125 --> 00:26:27,168
Our Young Men's Association
president is here!

403
00:26:27,252 --> 00:26:28,920
-Oh, you're here.
-Dig in!

404
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:32,674
Hey.

405
00:26:34,134 --> 00:26:37,762
-I heard you did great today.
-Well, everything I do is great.

406
00:26:39,306 --> 00:26:40,598
Did you get a lot of orders?

407
00:26:40,682 --> 00:26:42,267
Of course, I grew those peaches.

408
00:26:44,477 --> 00:26:45,729
-Come closer.
-What?

409
00:26:45,812 --> 00:26:47,856
-You'll get bitten by mosquitoes.
-Mosquitoes?

410
00:26:50,025 --> 00:26:53,111
Here comes some meat.

411
00:26:53,194 --> 00:26:56,114
Delicious meat.
Doesn't matter how you cook it.

412
00:26:56,197 --> 00:26:59,159
Stack them tight inside your belly.
Okay, doctor?

413
00:27:00,744 --> 00:27:01,870
Well, I…

414
00:27:02,829 --> 00:27:06,082
I actually don't eat meat,
so you don't have to worry about me.

415
00:27:06,916 --> 00:27:07,876
You don't eat meat?

416
00:27:07,959 --> 00:27:11,338
You're kidding, right?
I mean, you don't eat meat at all?

417
00:27:11,421 --> 00:27:14,049
You don't eat meat? Then what do you eat?

418
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:15,967
Come on,

419
00:27:16,051 --> 00:27:19,888
I heard you used up a lot of energy
pulling that calf out.

420
00:27:19,971 --> 00:27:21,973
You must be secretly eating
something good.

421
00:27:22,599 --> 00:27:26,478
My gosh. So what is it?
You should share if it's that good.

422
00:27:26,561 --> 00:27:29,773
My goodness, look at our
Young Men's Association president eating.

423
00:27:29,856 --> 00:27:31,483
That's how you eat.

424
00:27:31,566 --> 00:27:35,236
A Huidong man can even eat
a piece of rubber, you know?

425
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:37,322
Feed him. Just feed him everything.

426
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:41,409
If you eat rubber,
there's just something wrong with you.

427
00:27:42,243 --> 00:27:46,206
Hear, hear.
A man should be able to eat anything.

428
00:27:46,289 --> 00:27:48,333
You can't be picky with food!

429
00:27:48,833 --> 00:27:51,503
If the whole nation ate meat
like Sang-hyeon,

430
00:27:52,045 --> 00:27:53,755
raising cows would be so rewarding.

431
00:27:54,339 --> 00:27:55,715
Will you give it a rest?

432
00:27:55,799 --> 00:27:57,550
You're making him uncomfortable.

433
00:28:00,261 --> 00:28:03,390
All right, let's drink.

434
00:28:07,185 --> 00:28:08,895
Oh, my.

435
00:28:09,521 --> 00:28:12,774
That's actually good news.
It means there's more for us.

436
00:28:12,857 --> 00:28:13,942
-You're right.
-Hear, hear.

437
00:28:14,025 --> 00:28:16,236
Ja-young, you did such a good job today.

438
00:28:16,319 --> 00:28:17,779
-Here, eat up.
-All right.

439
00:28:20,156 --> 00:28:23,952
-What is that?
-Guess what this is!

440
00:28:26,037 --> 00:28:28,665
I love our Women's Association president.

441
00:28:28,748 --> 00:28:30,625
-She's bringing out her best liquor.
-What is that?

442
00:28:31,209 --> 00:28:34,754
-Today's a good day…
-It's her special bush clover liquor.

443
00:28:34,838 --> 00:28:36,798
We have a special guest, and…

444
00:28:36,881 --> 00:28:40,218
She makes it bush clover, raspberries,
and some other things.

445
00:28:41,136 --> 00:28:44,389
But she keeps the other ingredients
and the ratio a secret.

446
00:28:44,472 --> 00:28:47,267
You'll get to have two glasses each.

447
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:51,521
Especially those men here
who don't really need it, okay?

448
00:28:51,604 --> 00:28:54,441
-All right, pass it around.
-I hear it's very tasty,

449
00:28:54,524 --> 00:28:57,861
but the effects are
supposed to be quite impressive.

450
00:28:57,944 --> 00:29:01,072
I wouldn't know though.
I've only had one sip.

451
00:29:01,698 --> 00:29:02,991
Hey, is it really true?

452
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:06,077
Are you seriously asking me about that?

453
00:29:06,161 --> 00:29:07,704
Well, I don't know.

454
00:29:07,787 --> 00:29:09,581
It's supposed to be good for men.

455
00:29:10,582 --> 00:29:11,833
I guess you do consider me a man.

456
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:14,794
Here.

457
00:29:14,878 --> 00:29:16,546
Here I am.

458
00:29:17,797 --> 00:29:19,799
Do you want a glass, Sang-hyeon?

459
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:24,304
All right.

460
00:29:27,098 --> 00:29:28,266
And you, Ja-young?

461
00:29:28,349 --> 00:29:31,102
No, I'm supposed to switch shifts
with Sergeant Yoon,

462
00:29:31,186 --> 00:29:32,353
so I have to get going.

463
00:29:32,437 --> 00:29:33,688
Today, of all days?

464
00:29:34,272 --> 00:29:36,524
How about you, doctor?
Would you like a glass?

465
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:37,650
I'm good too.

466
00:29:38,234 --> 00:29:40,904
Good call.
It's a lot stronger than you think.

467
00:29:46,951 --> 00:29:48,787
I guess I can have one glass.

468
00:29:50,038 --> 00:29:51,831
Okay. Give it here.

469
00:29:52,624 --> 00:29:53,708
You really shouldn't.

470
00:29:54,667 --> 00:29:55,543
Here.

471
00:29:57,879 --> 00:30:00,215
They say it's quite effective,

472
00:30:00,298 --> 00:30:01,966
so I'm curious.

473
00:30:11,267 --> 00:30:12,977
Sang-hyeon, do you want one more?

474
00:30:16,397 --> 00:30:18,358
And one more for the doctor too.

475
00:30:26,825 --> 00:30:29,702
Well, you've both had some liquor.

476
00:30:29,786 --> 00:30:33,790
But Ja-young hasn't had any,
so what should we do with her?

477
00:30:33,873 --> 00:30:37,502
There's something we can't miss
especially on a day like this.

478
00:30:37,585 --> 00:30:41,673
We've got to hear a song
sung by Huidong's pride,

479
00:30:41,756 --> 00:30:44,342
Huidong's singer, Ahn Ja-young!

480
00:30:46,719 --> 00:30:50,390
-Ahn Ja-young!
-Ahn Ja-young!

481
00:30:50,473 --> 00:30:53,226
I guess it has been a while
since I sing for you guys.

482
00:30:58,773 --> 00:31:00,108
Applause!

483
00:31:03,611 --> 00:31:04,904
One, two, three, four.

484
00:31:04,988 --> 00:31:09,534
Who might you be

485
00:31:10,034 --> 00:31:14,122
That you took away my heart?

486
00:31:15,707 --> 00:31:17,709
I am crying

487
00:31:17,792 --> 00:31:19,168
Because of you

488
00:31:19,752 --> 00:31:21,629
I am laughing

489
00:31:21,713 --> 00:31:24,549
Because of you

490
00:31:25,258 --> 00:31:29,929
Who might you be

491
00:31:30,013 --> 00:31:34,267
That you set my heart ablaze?

492
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:40,690
Who could the yearning reflection
In the mirror?

493
00:31:42,442 --> 00:31:48,698
Come and look me in the eyes
And you'll see

494
00:31:48,781 --> 00:31:52,869
Why is it that I want to trust you?

495
00:31:52,952 --> 00:31:57,790
Why is it that I love you?

496
00:31:57,874 --> 00:32:02,420
Who might you be

497
00:32:02,503 --> 00:32:06,341
That you took my heart away?

498
00:32:14,515 --> 00:32:16,893
You took my heart away, Ahn Ja-young!

499
00:32:19,729 --> 00:32:24,734
All right, cheers to our VIP of the day,
the vet from Seoul!

500
00:32:30,823 --> 00:32:31,783
I should get going.

501
00:32:31,866 --> 00:32:33,576
-What?
-What?

502
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:35,370
-What did you say?
-You're leaving?

503
00:32:35,453 --> 00:32:37,455
-He should sing.
-But why?

504
00:32:37,538 --> 00:32:39,082
-Why is he spoiling the mood?
-Where's he going?

505
00:32:39,165 --> 00:32:40,333
What did you say?

506
00:32:41,167 --> 00:32:42,251
Come on, guys.

507
00:32:42,835 --> 00:32:43,962
Enjoy your meal.

508
00:32:45,046 --> 00:32:46,381
That's not cool at all.

509
00:32:47,131 --> 00:32:48,800
-Let me go with you.
-I'm sorry?

510
00:32:48,883 --> 00:32:51,761
I have to leave too,
since I have my night shift.

511
00:32:51,844 --> 00:32:52,679
It's on the way.

512
00:32:54,597 --> 00:32:56,724
-Then I will--
-Sang-hyeon, my glass is empty!

513
00:32:57,266 --> 00:32:58,267
Get over here.

514
00:32:58,351 --> 00:32:59,894
-Come here.
-What are you doing?

515
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:00,979
Quickly!

516
00:33:01,062 --> 00:33:02,271
-Okay.
-What are you doing?

517
00:33:02,355 --> 00:33:03,898
Go be a good drinking buddy.

518
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:06,234
-Come here and pour me a glass!
-See you later.

519
00:33:07,318 --> 00:33:08,152
Let's go.

520
00:33:20,581 --> 00:33:23,459
Be careful of the ridges.
You could fall in.

521
00:33:23,543 --> 00:33:24,627
Okay.

522
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:30,425
-Did you have a lot to drink?
-What?

523
00:33:31,384 --> 00:33:33,261
You don't look so happy.

524
00:33:33,928 --> 00:33:35,596
I'd say kind of uneasy.

525
00:33:37,098 --> 00:33:38,099
I'm not.

526
00:33:42,186 --> 00:33:45,356
If I have some time tomorrow,
I think I'll bring the puppies in.

527
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,483
We can't just leave them there.

528
00:33:47,567 --> 00:33:49,694
I should bring them
straight to the hospital, right?

529
00:33:50,611 --> 00:33:52,613
-All by yourself?
-Yes.

530
00:33:54,490 --> 00:33:56,200
Would that be kind of difficult?

531
00:33:57,702 --> 00:33:58,703
In that case,

532
00:33:59,662 --> 00:34:00,663
would you come with me?

533
00:34:08,588 --> 00:34:11,799
You think you should go with Mr. Lee.

534
00:34:11,883 --> 00:34:13,676
I'm fully booked tomorrow.

535
00:34:17,430 --> 00:34:18,890
I didn't think it through.

536
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:22,351
I wouldn't want to cause
any misunderstanding.

537
00:34:30,359 --> 00:34:31,360
Are you okay?

538
00:34:32,737 --> 00:34:33,654
Yes.

539
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:35,281
You're not hurt?

540
00:34:36,032 --> 00:34:37,450
Your bicycle…

541
00:34:43,706 --> 00:34:46,000
-Shine the light on the ground, please.
-Oh, sure.

542
00:35:02,892 --> 00:35:03,810
I'm sorry.

543
00:35:04,519 --> 00:35:07,271
Right after I told you to be careful…
I'm sorry.

544
00:35:08,564 --> 00:35:10,608
It's okay. It's dark out here.

545
00:35:14,028 --> 00:35:17,490
Maybe I should file
a civil complaint to pave the road here

546
00:35:17,573 --> 00:35:20,368
and put up some street lights.
Flashlights aren't enough.

547
00:35:23,454 --> 00:35:25,123
You should see if the chain is okay.

548
00:35:25,206 --> 00:35:27,959
No, don't touch it.
Your hands will get dirty.

549
00:35:34,674 --> 00:35:36,259
I'll rinse it with water and look.

550
00:35:38,928 --> 00:35:41,848
Seriously, it's okay. Stop feeling sorry.

551
00:35:42,723 --> 00:35:43,766
But still…

552
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:50,106
Hey, what are you doing?

553
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:53,901
Why are you here?

554
00:35:53,985 --> 00:35:55,862
Is the party already over?

555
00:36:04,996 --> 00:36:07,039
You left a while ago,
and you're still here?

556
00:36:10,501 --> 00:36:12,003
You must be a lightweight.

557
00:36:12,712 --> 00:36:14,297
Falling into the rice paddy.

558
00:36:16,424 --> 00:36:18,926
You must have been really worried
about something.

559
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:20,344
Following us all the way here.

560
00:36:20,428 --> 00:36:23,514
She left with a guy who was curious
about the effects of the liquor,

561
00:36:23,598 --> 00:36:24,891
so of course I was worried.

562
00:36:24,974 --> 00:36:27,310
Men are all the same, aren't they?

563
00:36:28,311 --> 00:36:29,478
You'd know.

564
00:36:29,562 --> 00:36:31,022
Hey, are you drunk?

565
00:36:31,606 --> 00:36:33,900
Why are you accusing him like that?

566
00:36:33,983 --> 00:36:35,151
I didn't drink that much.

567
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:40,823
Since he is here, I'll get going now.

568
00:36:42,116 --> 00:36:44,952
Will you be okay?
Your bicycle is all messed up.

569
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:48,289
Well, the light still works,

570
00:36:49,874 --> 00:36:52,960
and he says
that he's different from other shady men.

571
00:36:53,794 --> 00:36:56,714
So I'll think of this
as leaving you with a girlfriend

572
00:36:58,591 --> 00:36:59,926
and be on my way.

573
00:37:02,553 --> 00:37:03,721
Do you mind?

574
00:37:08,851 --> 00:37:10,728
Ahn Ja-young, I'm the same.

575
00:37:11,854 --> 00:37:12,730
What do you mean?

576
00:37:13,272 --> 00:37:15,733
I'm the same as any other dude out there.

577
00:37:17,526 --> 00:37:20,571
When I see you,
I want to hold you and hug you.

578
00:37:23,241 --> 00:37:24,408
Just like them.

579
00:37:27,411 --> 00:37:28,246
I like you.

580
00:37:29,705 --> 00:37:30,748
Ahn Ja-young.

581
00:37:33,209 --> 00:37:34,168
What I'm saying is,

582
00:37:35,002 --> 00:37:36,921
don't feel too comfortable with me.

583
00:38:08,494 --> 00:38:10,997
-Officer Ahn just stopped by.
-Was she alone?

584
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:13,457
She wasn't with Mr. Lee or anyone else?

585
00:38:13,541 --> 00:38:14,750
Are they dating now?

586
00:38:14,834 --> 00:38:16,002
The summer sure feels long, doesn't it?

587
00:38:16,085 --> 00:38:19,130
Right. You have to get back to Seoul.

588
00:38:19,213 --> 00:38:21,924
If you'll be gone soon,
don't give her the wrong idea.

589
00:38:22,008 --> 00:38:25,219
Doctor, did Ja-young do something wrong?

590
00:38:25,303 --> 00:38:28,723
Why did you do something I never asked
and make me feel indebted?

591
00:38:28,806 --> 00:38:30,141
Look, Mr. Han Ji-yul.

592
00:38:31,183 --> 00:38:33,561
Officer Ahn! Wake up, please!

593
00:38:33,644 --> 00:38:38,024
