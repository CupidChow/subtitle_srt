1
00:00:56,347 --> 00:00:58,433
So when is it?

2
00:01:00,143 --> 00:01:01,644
What do you…

3
00:01:01,728 --> 00:01:03,563
When are you going back to Seoul?

4
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:09,319
I guess you already heard.

5
00:01:10,737 --> 00:01:12,113
In about 15 days.

6
00:01:16,993 --> 00:01:18,078
I know.

7
00:01:19,704 --> 00:01:22,082
Telling you how I feel
when I know I'm leaving soon…

8
00:01:22,791 --> 00:01:24,459
You must be confused.

9
00:01:26,961 --> 00:01:27,837
I deserve to be rejected.

10
00:01:29,214 --> 00:01:30,298
I know, but--

11
00:01:45,605 --> 00:01:46,898
You don't know squat.

12
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:05,708
Over there.

13
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:07,544
Hide.

14
00:02:10,839 --> 00:02:11,840
Hey, Little Doctor.

15
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:14,884
I put together
a list of drugs for inventory,

16
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:16,302
and a list of ones to order.

17
00:02:16,386 --> 00:02:18,847
-Could you take a look?
-Sure.

18
00:02:20,098 --> 00:02:21,099
Let me see.

19
00:02:21,891 --> 00:02:22,767
Well,

20
00:02:22,851 --> 00:02:24,936
it all looks good.

21
00:02:25,019 --> 00:02:26,271
Good work.

22
00:02:26,354 --> 00:02:27,230
Thanks.

23
00:02:48,918 --> 00:02:49,836
Is everything okay?

24
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:52,130
Yes. I don't think she saw you.

25
00:02:53,423 --> 00:02:55,758
If Yeong-suk saw us together earlier,

26
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:57,677
she would have fainted right there.

27
00:03:01,764 --> 00:03:04,642
We have to keep this a secret, right?

28
00:03:04,726 --> 00:03:05,768
Us dating.

29
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,396
Date…

30
00:03:09,063 --> 00:03:10,064
Dating?

31
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:13,109
Dating…

32
00:03:15,278 --> 00:03:16,821
You know how this village is.

33
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:19,657
If word gets out that we are dating,

34
00:03:19,741 --> 00:03:22,535
they'll probably
start preparing for our wedding.

35
00:03:23,661 --> 00:03:26,456
Everyone we run into
will have something to say.

36
00:03:27,582 --> 00:03:30,126
So we should try our best
to keep it a secret.

37
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:36,758
I think I'll be fine
with whatever they do or say.

38
00:03:36,841 --> 00:03:39,344
But since you want to keep it a secret,

39
00:03:39,427 --> 00:03:41,763
I'll do my best as well.

40
00:03:41,846 --> 00:03:44,057
You've never had it happen to you.

41
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:46,100
Once you do,
you'll probably feel different.

42
00:03:49,812 --> 00:03:50,855
I don't think I will.

43
00:03:52,148 --> 00:03:54,692
Don't worry. I'll be careful. I mean it.

44
00:03:56,986 --> 00:04:00,573
I guess I'll call you after work.

45
00:04:18,383 --> 00:04:20,176
This is bad for my heart.

46
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:22,971
This dating thing.

47
00:04:24,222 --> 00:04:25,181
Dating?

48
00:04:29,686 --> 00:04:31,813
Oh, gosh.

49
00:04:56,671 --> 00:04:57,755
Nurungji.

50
00:04:58,798 --> 00:05:00,550
Nurungji, come here.

51
00:05:02,051 --> 00:05:04,262
Have you been good, Nurungji? Come here.

52
00:05:05,054 --> 00:05:06,264
Come here, Nurungji.

53
00:05:06,347 --> 00:05:09,475
I'm going to let you in on a secret.

54
00:05:10,184 --> 00:05:12,437
I'm dating Doctor Han.

55
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:16,733
Did you get that?
You can't tell anyone, okay?

56
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:18,568
Okay? It's our little secret.

57
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:20,194
Okay, my baby?

58
00:05:20,278 --> 00:05:22,488
There, there.

59
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:48,639
I'M HAN JI-YUL. I'LL COME BACK.
LET'S BE SECRET FRIENDS AGAIN!

60
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:52,143
Adorable.

61
00:06:04,155 --> 00:06:06,657
-Here you go, Little Doctor.
-Right.

62
00:06:06,741 --> 00:06:08,785
The medical records that you asked for.

63
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:11,996
This box contains the past five years'
and older ones are in there.

64
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:13,790
So why do you need these?

65
00:06:17,085 --> 00:06:21,297
I am technically practicing as
a large animal veterinarian at the moment.

66
00:06:22,131 --> 00:06:24,967
I want to take a look at
what Grandpa did and study them.

67
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:27,762
But you're going back to Seoul soon.

68
00:06:28,471 --> 00:06:30,932
You won't be seeing large animals
even if you want to.

69
00:06:31,015 --> 00:06:32,558
I guess, but…

70
00:06:32,642 --> 00:06:35,645
I just want to be good at everything.

71
00:06:38,272 --> 00:06:39,273
What?

72
00:06:39,357 --> 00:06:40,274
Wait.

73
00:06:40,358 --> 00:06:42,151
That wasn't Director Han's suitcase?

74
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:46,948
I asked someone to send me
some clothes I used to wear in Seoul.

75
00:06:47,448 --> 00:06:49,784
I didn't want to
keep wearing the same clothes.

76
00:06:49,867 --> 00:06:53,412
You got more of your stuff sent?
But you're leaving so soon.

77
00:06:53,496 --> 00:06:57,125
I had to wash my clothes too often,
and it was getting tiresome.

78
00:06:57,208 --> 00:06:58,751
They don't dry so easily either.

79
00:06:59,544 --> 00:07:01,170
It's so strange.

80
00:07:02,004 --> 00:07:05,133
You looked like an exile
counting his days to go back.

81
00:07:05,216 --> 00:07:07,009
I felt bad for you.

82
00:07:07,635 --> 00:07:09,595
This town must have grown on you.

83
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:13,766
I wish it would have sooner.
It's sad when you're leaving so soon.

84
00:07:18,521 --> 00:07:22,024
Had I known this would happen,
I would have bought some sheet masks.

85
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:56,726
What is it?

86
00:07:57,393 --> 00:08:02,607
It's just weird for us
to be together at this hour.

87
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:05,818
I was in such a bad mood this morning.

88
00:08:05,902 --> 00:08:06,944
I feel the same way.

89
00:08:07,695 --> 00:08:09,363
This feels surreal.

90
00:08:09,447 --> 00:08:10,823
I'm on cloud nine.

91
00:08:12,575 --> 00:08:14,952
Someone's changed their attitude
all of a sudden.

92
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:18,539
You were getting on my nerves
to no end like a total…

93
00:08:19,874 --> 00:08:21,042
Rude person.

94
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:26,380
And that "jerk" is now being all sweet
and only saying nice things, right?

95
00:08:27,673 --> 00:08:29,592
You must have wanted to
hear me say I liked you.

96
00:08:29,675 --> 00:08:31,219
I should have told you sooner.

97
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:36,557
Aunt Yeon-hong used to warn me
to be careful with men from Seoul.

98
00:08:36,641 --> 00:08:39,352
She said that they are
all a bunch of smooth talkers.

99
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:43,231
Maybe I should reconsider this
before it's too late.

100
00:08:44,106 --> 00:08:46,275
It's too late. You can't take it back.

101
00:08:50,738 --> 00:08:52,740
So are we going somewhere?

102
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,701
Now that you mention it…

103
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:58,704
Where can we hang out
without other people knowing?

104
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:03,292
Want to go to Seoul?

105
00:09:05,419 --> 00:09:06,254
Right now?

106
00:09:19,016 --> 00:09:20,393
Can I have one of these?

107
00:09:21,143 --> 00:09:22,311
Sure. Go ahead.

108
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:45,251
It's tasty.

109
00:09:47,461 --> 00:09:49,422
To think we're going to Seoul
at this hour.

110
00:09:49,505 --> 00:09:51,382
And to hang out at that.

111
00:09:51,465 --> 00:09:52,883
It's the safest place.

112
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:54,969
And it's closer than you think.

113
00:09:58,889 --> 00:10:01,392
I'll show you around my hospital.

114
00:10:15,823 --> 00:10:18,367
DR. CHOI ANIMAL HOSPITAL

115
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:24,040
So this is where you usually work?

116
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:29,337
It hasn't been even that long,
but it feels so unfamiliar.

117
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:32,173
I must be getting used to
the veterinary hospital.

118
00:10:35,926 --> 00:10:37,178
I'll show you my office.

119
00:10:45,227 --> 00:10:46,062
Wow.

120
00:10:46,687 --> 00:10:47,772
What do you think?

121
00:10:47,855 --> 00:10:49,857
It's so neat.

122
00:10:50,941 --> 00:10:52,568
VETERINARIAN HAN JI-YUL

123
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:54,737
This guy looks like a handful.

124
00:11:00,576 --> 00:11:02,995
It's not that far, don't you think?

125
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:05,456
Honestly, you can't say it's not that far.

126
00:11:05,539 --> 00:11:07,083
It takes over four hours.

127
00:11:09,752 --> 00:11:10,670
Look at this.

128
00:11:10,753 --> 00:11:13,005
Today is already over. It's past midnight.

129
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:16,092
I suppose we should have left
a little sooner.

130
00:11:17,802 --> 00:11:21,430
But those four hours did feel very short.

131
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:23,557
I almost didn't want it to end.

132
00:11:25,393 --> 00:11:26,435
I'm really okay.

133
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:28,896
If eight-hour round trips
were going to be a problem,

134
00:11:28,979 --> 00:11:29,980
I wouldn't have started this.

135
00:11:36,278 --> 00:11:38,823
I brought you here
to shake off your worries,

136
00:11:38,906 --> 00:11:41,617
but I guess I was worried about nothing,
Ms. Ahn Ja-young.

137
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:43,536
Of course.

138
00:11:44,703 --> 00:11:47,581
I'll do better

139
00:11:47,665 --> 00:11:50,584
so that eight-hour round trips
feel like nothing.

140
00:11:53,295 --> 00:11:54,296
You're so pretty.

141
00:11:55,673 --> 00:11:57,341
How did you get so pretty?

142
00:12:04,306 --> 00:12:08,185
I think I'd be even prettier
if I had something to eat.

143
00:12:10,646 --> 00:12:12,982
Shall we go grab a bite then?

144
00:12:14,483 --> 00:12:15,359
Let's go.

145
00:12:16,777 --> 00:12:18,404
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

146
00:12:23,868 --> 00:12:25,077
-It's good.
-Wow.

147
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:27,163
You really did get prettier.

148
00:12:29,957 --> 00:12:31,041
You can really eat.

149
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:36,172
-I have a question.
-What is it?

150
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:38,174
Have you ever brought someone else there?

151
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:39,467
Let's talk about something else.

152
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:41,343
-I don't think this could end well.
-What?

153
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:42,386
Anyway, Officer Ahn.

154
00:12:43,095 --> 00:12:44,930
-Yes.
-You look cute in that T-shirt.

155
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:46,056
This?

156
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:48,142
It's not from
your middle school days, is it?

157
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:50,561
-That shirt.
-Yes?

158
00:12:50,644 --> 00:12:52,646
Is it the same one as back then
but in a different color?

159
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:55,357
I mean, when I work at the hospital…

160
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:57,610
-Sang-hyeon dresses really well.
-Sang-hyeon…

161
00:12:58,861 --> 00:13:00,488
Why did you stop talking?

162
00:13:00,571 --> 00:13:01,572
Hang on.

163
00:13:02,573 --> 00:13:04,033
When did you start liking me?

164
00:13:04,992 --> 00:13:07,828
It wasn't exactly love at first sight.
I gradually grew to--

165
00:13:07,912 --> 00:13:10,456
"Wasn't exactly love at first sight"?
What do you mean…

166
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:31,143
You don't have much time left to sleep.
Go in now.

167
00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:32,978
You go get some sleep too, Doctor.

168
00:13:34,688 --> 00:13:37,691
When will you stop calling me "Doctor"?

169
00:13:42,821 --> 00:13:44,949
We can work that out over time…

170
00:13:45,032 --> 00:13:47,993
You said you'd rather die
than call me oppa.

171
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:50,496
In that case…

172
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:53,207
How about "babe" or "honey"?

173
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:56,585
You must have gone mad
from driving all night.

174
00:13:57,253 --> 00:13:58,879
You should go home now.

175
00:13:59,922 --> 00:14:01,674
-Bye.
-Bye.

176
00:14:08,597 --> 00:14:10,766
Nurungji, you were awake?

177
00:14:11,308 --> 00:14:13,936
Were you? You weren't sleeping, Nurungji?

178
00:14:15,437 --> 00:14:17,731
Seriously, Han Ji-yul.

179
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:20,859
Come here.

180
00:14:24,321 --> 00:14:25,239
Babe.

181
00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:32,746
What?

182
00:14:33,497 --> 00:14:35,374
Does it sound weird to you too?

183
00:14:35,457 --> 00:14:37,251
Are you cringing?

184
00:14:40,087 --> 00:14:42,298
Seriously, how can I call him such things?

185
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:44,216
I can't believe him.

186
00:15:10,117 --> 00:15:11,410
What's with her?

187
00:15:12,119 --> 00:15:15,080
I'm not sure. She's a little…

188
00:15:20,628 --> 00:15:22,212
Yes, this is Ahn Ja-young.

189
00:15:25,674 --> 00:15:28,010
Rats are going in and out of the hole?

190
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:30,679
Okay. It shouldn't be too hard
to catch them.

191
00:15:32,306 --> 00:15:34,016
Later today?

192
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:38,729
I'll be off work by then,
so it might be a little difficult.

193
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:43,525
Okay, then instead of this evening,
I'll be there tomorrow afternoon.

194
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:47,655
Did she really just put something off
because she has to get off work?

195
00:15:48,572 --> 00:15:49,657
I think she did.

196
00:15:50,324 --> 00:15:51,700
Has she ever done that before?

197
00:15:55,412 --> 00:15:56,455
Did you go to work?

198
00:15:57,122 --> 00:15:58,123
You must be so tired.

199
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:01,210
I'm okay.

200
00:16:01,877 --> 00:16:04,630
This is my first time texting you.
It feels strange.

201
00:16:06,423 --> 00:16:08,008
Shall I make it even stranger?

202
00:16:11,887 --> 00:16:12,888
Hello!

203
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:14,515
What brings you in here so early?

204
00:16:14,598 --> 00:16:15,474
Hello.

205
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:19,186
Hello, Officer Ahn.

206
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:21,897
Hi.

207
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:28,821
Good morning.

208
00:16:29,947 --> 00:16:33,909
You said you'd come pick up dog food
for Nurungji, but you didn't come.

209
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:38,080
I did say that, didn't I?

210
00:16:38,872 --> 00:16:41,083
It's really heavy,

211
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:44,211
so I think
I should drop it off at your place.

212
00:16:44,294 --> 00:16:47,006
I need you to unlock the door.
Can you spare a few minutes?

213
00:16:49,425 --> 00:16:52,594
-If it's heavy, I could carry--
-No, go ahead. You can go.

214
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:55,848
Dog food can be really heavy. Go ahead.

215
00:16:58,267 --> 00:16:59,893
-Okay.
-Shall we go?

216
00:17:03,105 --> 00:17:03,981
Bye.

217
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:10,738
No. It was fine.

218
00:17:10,821 --> 00:17:12,197
"Okay."

219
00:17:13,657 --> 00:17:14,867
That was smooth.

220
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:19,955
Do you think we'll be okay?

221
00:17:20,581 --> 00:17:22,082
I'm really worried.

222
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:24,626
We'll be fine.

223
00:17:25,377 --> 00:17:26,754
I was kidding.

224
00:17:29,423 --> 00:17:31,091
So where's the dog food?

225
00:17:31,175 --> 00:17:32,259
I don't see it.

226
00:17:33,969 --> 00:17:35,304
I actually came to see you.

227
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:46,398
You didn't get much sleep,
so I wanted you to get some rest.

228
00:17:50,652 --> 00:17:53,238
It must be nice.
You're so relaxed about all of this.

229
00:17:54,406 --> 00:17:55,991
You're really good at this.

230
00:17:58,035 --> 00:18:02,372
Maybe I should have taken some kind of
crash course lesson on dating.

231
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:07,086
I'm the only one
who keeps acting all awkward.

232
00:18:09,171 --> 00:18:10,047
Look here.

233
00:18:10,881 --> 00:18:11,757
Officer Ahn.

234
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:14,843
I am not relaxed at all, okay?

235
00:18:16,178 --> 00:18:18,180
Looking at you like this,

236
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:21,558
I'm surprised by
how totally out of control I am.

237
00:18:23,352 --> 00:18:27,481
I've never once come to
a girlfriend's workplace

238
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:30,317
just because I missed her.

239
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:33,779
Rather,

240
00:18:35,906 --> 00:18:36,949
it's really…

241
00:18:42,996 --> 00:18:44,123
Hey, Doctor!

242
00:18:45,249 --> 00:18:46,834
-Hello.
-Hello.

243
00:18:46,917 --> 00:18:49,378
-Hey.
-You were here too, Ja-young.

244
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:50,379
Yes.

245
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:51,880
Hi.

246
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:55,342
-Looks like you two made up.
-Yes.

247
00:18:56,009 --> 00:18:57,803
Looks like you also made up
with the doctor.

248
00:18:59,263 --> 00:19:00,889
Did we make up?

249
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:02,516
I guess we did.

250
00:19:06,478 --> 00:19:07,312
Why am I here?

251
00:19:07,938 --> 00:19:12,693
He's giving me a ride
for some work I have to do.

252
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:14,653
I see.

253
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:22,661
We decided to start dating.

254
00:19:24,371 --> 00:19:25,330
-What?
-What?

255
00:19:25,414 --> 00:19:27,833
Since it's all thanks to you,

256
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:31,461
she said we should tell you about this.

257
00:19:31,545 --> 00:19:34,214
Please keep this a secret
from the other grown-ups.

258
00:19:34,298 --> 00:19:36,842
It'll be such a headache
if others find out.

259
00:19:37,801 --> 00:19:39,761
You know what the people here are like.

260
00:19:44,266 --> 00:19:45,309
Have these.

261
00:19:45,392 --> 00:19:46,810
They taste funny.

262
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:50,772
-Thanks.
-Okay then. Have a good day.

263
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:51,982
You too, bye.

264
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:56,820
Wow. Seon-dong's wish came true.

265
00:19:56,904 --> 00:19:58,197
You see?

266
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,866
Even nine-year-olds know instinctively

267
00:20:00,949 --> 00:20:02,534
how risky it is to date openly.

268
00:20:03,327 --> 00:20:05,829
Are we really going to be okay?
I'm so worried.

269
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:10,292
They'll just think
that you got a ride from me.

270
00:20:10,918 --> 00:20:11,919
They're just kids.

271
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:14,630
Just a moment.

272
00:20:16,506 --> 00:20:17,507
Yes, Ms. Lee.

273
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:20,719
Yes, I understand.

274
00:20:25,307 --> 00:20:27,935
Let's have dinner together later.

275
00:20:32,147 --> 00:20:33,148
My goodness.

276
00:20:33,857 --> 00:20:35,943
It's so hot!

277
00:20:36,652 --> 00:20:39,529
We don't want Ja-young
to get a heatstroke. It's hot, isn't it?

278
00:20:39,613 --> 00:20:40,489
Is it hot?

279
00:20:41,114 --> 00:20:42,532
I feel fine.

280
00:20:42,616 --> 00:20:44,534
It's just so nice and sunny today.

281
00:20:46,328 --> 00:20:49,206
I don't know if it's the sweat,
but your face has this glow.

282
00:20:49,289 --> 00:20:51,833
I think you're suffering
from a bad case of heatstroke.

283
00:20:52,668 --> 00:20:58,215
I can almost smell the peach wine
from all the way over here.

284
00:21:05,597 --> 00:21:08,558
-It's working!
-My goodness!

285
00:21:08,642 --> 00:21:10,644
-That's our girl!
-There goes Ja-young.

286
00:21:10,727 --> 00:21:12,396
Is there anything you can't do?

287
00:21:12,479 --> 00:21:14,064
-My gosh, it's so cool.
-It is.

288
00:21:14,564 --> 00:21:16,358
By the way,

289
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:18,568
I'm sorry that you had to be here
fixing a fan

290
00:21:18,652 --> 00:21:21,530
when it's so "nice and sunny," Ja-young.

291
00:21:21,613 --> 00:21:25,575
You really should go out somewhere nice
with someone

292
00:21:25,659 --> 00:21:28,078
on such a "nice and sunny" day.

293
00:21:28,829 --> 00:21:31,081
I don't have anyone to see.

294
00:21:31,164 --> 00:21:32,249
That's right.

295
00:21:32,332 --> 00:21:34,501
You haven't taken a day off this year,
have you?

296
00:21:34,584 --> 00:21:37,879
Should we all go somewhere nice and cool
with Sang-hyeon?

297
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:40,090
-That would be great!
-It would!

298
00:21:41,466 --> 00:21:45,053
Why would we go in such a large group?
It'd be stifling.

299
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:49,182
Come on. Do you think they would go
just by themselves?

300
00:21:49,266 --> 00:21:50,559
We should all go together…

301
00:21:50,642 --> 00:21:52,853
-My goodness.
-…and set the mood for them.

302
00:21:52,936 --> 00:21:54,730
I'm telling you, that's not how we do it.

303
00:21:54,813 --> 00:21:57,774
Let's just cook a nice chicken dinner
for Sang-hyeon.

304
00:21:57,858 --> 00:21:58,734
And for Ja-young…

305
00:22:06,283 --> 00:22:07,159
No.

306
00:22:07,701 --> 00:22:11,288
It's Seon-dong.
Seon-dong sent me a funny text.

307
00:22:13,081 --> 00:22:14,041
Oh, my goodness.

308
00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:19,254
Hey, Ja-young. Are you doing
some work over here again?

309
00:22:20,756 --> 00:22:24,968
Jeez. Nothing gets done in this village
without this girl, does it?

310
00:22:25,052 --> 00:22:26,595
Stop working her day and night!

311
00:22:27,429 --> 00:22:30,140
What did you say? Seriously.

312
00:22:30,223 --> 00:22:33,602
Hey, what do you want?
Why did you come here?

313
00:22:33,685 --> 00:22:36,313
You came to spy on
our peach farm funding, didn't you?

314
00:22:37,606 --> 00:22:39,649
Spy on you? Nonsense.

315
00:22:40,233 --> 00:22:42,903
I'm not like you, okay?
I have a lot of work to do.

316
00:22:45,238 --> 00:22:48,742
Ja-young, you know Mr. Cho
who runs the tire shop, right?

317
00:22:48,825 --> 00:22:51,912
You're close to him, right?
I wanted to ask you to call him for me.

318
00:22:52,496 --> 00:22:55,332
I heard that he'll give a nice discount
if I go through you.

319
00:22:56,041 --> 00:23:00,670
You just yelled at us
for working her too much.

320
00:23:00,754 --> 00:23:03,548
-That's a double standard at its finest.
-Hey!

321
00:23:03,632 --> 00:23:07,594
I'm just asking for a simple phone call.
What's so hard about that?

322
00:23:07,677 --> 00:23:09,888
-How dare you liken me to you!
-What?

323
00:23:09,971 --> 00:23:13,892
Also, you know very well
that she likes to be needed for help!

324
00:23:13,975 --> 00:23:16,561
Naturally, people who lack affection…

325
00:23:16,645 --> 00:23:18,105
-What?
-Lack affection?

326
00:23:18,188 --> 00:23:19,648
You little…

327
00:23:19,731 --> 00:23:21,233
-You have no filter whatsoever…
-What are you doing?

328
00:23:21,316 --> 00:23:22,943
-…on that mouth of yours!
-My goodness.

329
00:23:23,026 --> 00:23:27,280
-What are you going to do about it?
-You better watch yourself!

330
00:23:30,367 --> 00:23:34,913
You're right. I used to love it
when people needed me.

331
00:23:35,914 --> 00:23:36,998
But I guess I've changed.

332
00:23:37,082 --> 00:23:39,876
You came for my help,
but I'm not happy about it.

333
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:42,462
Oh, no. I didn't mean it like that--

334
00:23:42,546 --> 00:23:45,298
All this time, I've been worried

335
00:23:45,382 --> 00:23:48,343
about people disliking me
or people not needing me anymore.

336
00:23:48,969 --> 00:23:51,638
But now I'm thinking
"Who cares if some people dislike me?"

337
00:23:52,222 --> 00:23:53,098
It's strange.

338
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,402
I'll give Mr. Cho a call.

339
00:24:06,069 --> 00:24:09,865
But not to make you like me.
It's out of respect for my elders.

340
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:13,577
Stop fighting.

341
00:24:15,453 --> 00:24:17,038
Ja-young, are you all right?

342
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:19,916
-Maybe her feelings were too hurt.
-It's so scary.

343
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,168
Did I do something wrong?

344
00:24:38,894 --> 00:24:39,853
Hey. What is it?

345
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:42,981
Ji-yul, Ji-yul, Han Ji-yul.
What's up? Are you busy?

346
00:24:43,064 --> 00:24:45,609
What is it?
Did something happen at the hospital?

347
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:50,906
What could happen at the hospital?
It's always the same.

348
00:24:51,781 --> 00:24:52,657
What is it then?

349
00:24:53,241 --> 00:24:54,075
Do you need money?

350
00:24:54,951 --> 00:24:57,621
-Video shoot?
-Oh, come on, seriously.

351
00:24:57,704 --> 00:25:01,750
Ji-yul, does it make you feel good
to have such a dry take on life?

352
00:25:02,667 --> 00:25:04,502
What's with you? You're creeping me out.

353
00:25:05,837 --> 00:25:08,256
What is it? What have you done this time?

354
00:25:08,965 --> 00:25:10,258
Just tell me.

355
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:12,552
I don't need a reason to call you.

356
00:25:12,636 --> 00:25:14,304
-I'll call you back later.
-What?

357
00:25:29,861 --> 00:25:30,820
It's strange.

358
00:25:31,446 --> 00:25:32,322
What?

359
00:25:33,531 --> 00:25:36,451
I feel like I'm a really good person
when I'm with you.

360
00:25:37,202 --> 00:25:40,288
I get all this confidence
for no apparent reason, you know?

361
00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:43,208
Is this one of those positive effects
of being in a relationship?

362
00:25:46,795 --> 00:25:48,505
-It makes me--
-It makes you…

363
00:25:49,673 --> 00:25:51,841
want to be an even better person.

364
00:25:52,425 --> 00:25:54,678
-Right?
-Yes.

365
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:01,685
I was feeling tired,
but now the fatigue is all gone.

366
00:26:01,768 --> 00:26:03,687
I'm going to treat you
to a delicious meal.

367
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:05,397
Where should we go?

368
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:10,902
What took you so long?

369
00:26:10,986 --> 00:26:13,530
-You should visit more often.
-We've been too busy.

370
00:26:13,613 --> 00:26:14,948
You can't be that busy.

371
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:19,452
-You want to eat here?
-Yes.

372
00:26:19,536 --> 00:26:20,370
No, we can't.

373
00:26:21,496 --> 00:26:24,082
The owner of that restaurant
is quick to notice things.

374
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:32,382
Auntie!

375
00:26:32,465 --> 00:26:35,176
Oh, my gosh. It's been so long, Ja-young!

376
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:36,428
Have you been well?

377
00:26:36,511 --> 00:26:39,264
Of course.
I missed your bean soup noodles.

378
00:26:39,347 --> 00:26:40,724
Good to have you here.

379
00:26:40,807 --> 00:26:41,766
Have a seat.

380
00:26:43,476 --> 00:26:44,602
Oh, my.

381
00:26:45,562 --> 00:26:47,355
Hello, Doctor Han.

382
00:26:48,356 --> 00:26:50,233
Hello.

383
00:26:50,859 --> 00:26:52,777
Fancy meeting you here.

384
00:26:52,861 --> 00:26:54,195
Are you by yourself?

385
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:55,864
Yes, of course.

386
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:58,575
I see. Shall we sit together then?

387
00:26:59,743 --> 00:27:01,077
Shall we?

388
00:27:01,161 --> 00:27:03,288
Weren't you expecting somebody?

389
00:27:07,959 --> 00:27:09,210
Well…

390
00:27:11,046 --> 00:27:13,340
-Apparently not.
-Well, then sit down.

391
00:27:14,341 --> 00:27:16,426
All right.
I'll have what he's having, Auntie.

392
00:27:16,509 --> 00:27:17,385
You got it.

393
00:27:21,973 --> 00:27:23,058
What is this?

394
00:27:23,141 --> 00:27:24,392
Sorry. My mistake.

395
00:27:34,778 --> 00:27:35,820
-Enjoy.
-Okay.

396
00:27:35,904 --> 00:27:37,197
Thank you, Auntie.

397
00:27:43,912 --> 00:27:45,914
I wasn't planning to eat two bowls.

398
00:27:45,997 --> 00:27:47,957
Now my belly feels like
it's about to explode.

399
00:27:51,419 --> 00:27:56,216
There isn't anyone around anymore.
Can we turn the light on?

400
00:27:56,299 --> 00:27:57,384
Oh, sure.

401
00:28:02,555 --> 00:28:03,515
Should we

402
00:28:04,432 --> 00:28:06,059
make pet names for each other?

403
00:28:06,142 --> 00:28:07,977
Something no one would suspect?

404
00:28:08,561 --> 00:28:10,063
You really are a cop.

405
00:28:10,146 --> 00:28:12,190
You're really thorough, Ms. Ahn.

406
00:28:14,776 --> 00:28:16,194
Since you're a veterinarian,

407
00:28:16,277 --> 00:28:19,739
you can use animal names
to stay under the radar.

408
00:28:22,617 --> 00:28:23,868
What would be good?

409
00:28:25,954 --> 00:28:28,706
I don't know.
No matter how hard I think about it,

410
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:31,584
I can only come up
with things like "cutie" and "sexy."

411
00:28:32,127 --> 00:28:33,378
Are you insane?

412
00:28:34,546 --> 00:28:35,922
Hey, you have a mole here.

413
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:38,633
Right.

414
00:28:40,593 --> 00:28:42,512
You also have one on your nose.

415
00:28:43,263 --> 00:28:44,180
Right there.

416
00:28:46,099 --> 00:28:48,977
Then, we should just go with Dot and Spot.

417
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:52,439
They totally sound like puppy names,
don't they?

418
00:29:00,196 --> 00:29:01,030
What's wrong?

419
00:29:01,114 --> 00:29:02,490
Do I have something on my face?

420
00:29:03,408 --> 00:29:04,409
A mole.

421
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:13,293
We should

422
00:29:14,502 --> 00:29:15,795
pick different names.

423
00:29:22,927 --> 00:29:26,848
Okay. We will.
But please give us some space.

424
00:29:26,931 --> 00:29:28,349
I need to talk to him alone.

425
00:29:43,656 --> 00:29:45,366
So you've decided to date him.

426
00:29:46,284 --> 00:29:47,160
Yes.

427
00:29:47,243 --> 00:29:48,453
You finally did it.

428
00:29:50,455 --> 00:29:51,581
Thank you.

429
00:29:52,332 --> 00:29:54,959
Talking to you really helped.

430
00:29:56,669 --> 00:29:59,798
I'm in this for the long haul.
I'll always be right here.

431
00:30:04,636 --> 00:30:05,678
What do you want me to say?

432
00:30:05,762 --> 00:30:08,014
"I'm happy for you.
I wish you a lifetime of happiness."

433
00:30:08,097 --> 00:30:10,308
-Is that what you want to hear?
-Yes!

434
00:30:10,391 --> 00:30:12,018
You don't have to mean it.

435
00:30:12,602 --> 00:30:13,728
You baby.

436
00:30:21,694 --> 00:30:23,571
You want to hear that I'm okay, right?

437
00:30:25,615 --> 00:30:26,574
What about you?

438
00:30:27,826 --> 00:30:28,701
Are you happy?

439
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:41,464
You're happy, all right.

440
00:30:42,215 --> 00:30:44,259
Yes, I'm happy.

441
00:30:46,761 --> 00:30:47,762
Then I'm happy too.

442
00:30:49,889 --> 00:30:51,307
-Really?
-Really.

443
00:30:52,308 --> 00:30:54,769
Han Ji-yul will be stressed out
from now on.

444
00:30:55,436 --> 00:30:57,897
Because I'll be giving him
a very hard time.

445
00:31:01,401 --> 00:31:02,402
Don't you dare.

446
00:31:04,153 --> 00:31:05,071
Gosh, seriously…

447
00:31:09,909 --> 00:31:11,202
This is just great.

448
00:31:22,255 --> 00:31:24,799
How do you feel now that you've told him?

449
00:31:28,094 --> 00:31:29,387
I'm grateful.

450
00:31:30,221 --> 00:31:31,431
And I feel bad.

451
00:31:32,056 --> 00:31:34,267
But also relieved.
A lot of different feelings.

452
00:31:36,769 --> 00:31:39,564
I could have given you
a ride home in my truck.

453
00:31:40,773 --> 00:31:43,610
If you keep driving by my place too often,

454
00:31:43,693 --> 00:31:45,153
people might get suspicious.

455
00:31:46,195 --> 00:31:47,196
I guess that's true.

456
00:31:49,115 --> 00:31:51,701
I'm making such a fuss
about dating, aren't I?

457
00:31:52,493 --> 00:31:55,580
It's not like I'm a celebrity.
Sorry about that.

458
00:31:57,916 --> 00:31:59,167
It's actually kind of fun.

459
00:31:59,834 --> 00:32:00,793
It's thrilling.

460
00:32:02,337 --> 00:32:04,881
Also, you're pretty much
a celebrity in Huidong.

461
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:10,219
I'm dating Ms. Ahn Ja-young,
who gets everyone's attention and love.

462
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:13,556
I can't complain over something like this,
don't you think?

463
00:32:14,182 --> 00:32:15,308
Oh, please.

464
00:32:16,768 --> 00:32:18,394
I'm telling you not to feel sorry.

465
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:21,189
If you're happy,

466
00:32:21,731 --> 00:32:22,607
I'm happy too.

467
00:32:28,071 --> 00:32:30,406
Should we try
what Hui-won gave us earlier today?

468
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:33,785
I used to eat these all the time
when I was little.

469
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:38,289
These are bribes to keep our mouths shut,
aren't they?

470
00:32:39,999 --> 00:32:41,000
A hundred percent.

471
00:32:54,931 --> 00:32:57,517
This tastes exactly the same
as what I had as a kid.

472
00:32:58,351 --> 00:32:59,894
It feels so funny.

473
00:33:13,783 --> 00:33:15,493
Oh, my goodness!

474
00:33:16,119 --> 00:33:19,247
What is this?
What are you doing hiding there?

475
00:33:46,691 --> 00:33:49,110
Let's go to an early movie.
I think that would be the safest.

476
00:33:49,193 --> 00:33:51,446
But I thought there was nothing
scheduled for this morning.

477
00:33:51,529 --> 00:33:53,573
Hey. We need you to come in.

478
00:33:53,656 --> 00:33:56,034
-Ms. Gil!
-Ms. Gil, where are you?

479
00:33:56,117 --> 00:33:58,661
Has it been two weeks since he went back?

480
00:33:58,745 --> 00:34:00,663
I'm worried that he'd get annoyed
if I call too often.

481
00:34:00,747 --> 00:34:02,206
That he'd end up not liking me anymore.

482
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:04,709
What's the point of dating
if you don't bother each other?

483
00:34:04,792 --> 00:34:07,587
Why won't you give me a chance
to worry about you and comfort you?

484
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:09,172
How do you think it's going to end?

485
00:34:09,255 --> 00:34:11,090
-Did you hear from him at all?
-From whom?

486
00:34:11,174 --> 00:34:13,092
Well, from Doctor Han.

487
00:34:14,385 --> 00:34:19,223
