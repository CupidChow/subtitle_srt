1
00:01:57,325 --> 00:01:58,743
Do you just hate your house?

2
00:02:02,705 --> 00:02:04,999
Seon-dong's summer break starts today,

3
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:07,085
so I ended up coming a bit early.

4
00:02:08,002 --> 00:02:09,963
I know you're glad to see me.

5
00:02:11,506 --> 00:02:13,424
Is something bothering you these days?

6
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:18,721
I guess something is.

7
00:02:19,472 --> 00:02:20,473
But I don't know what.

8
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:24,060
The village is the same every day.
What could it be?

9
00:02:27,188 --> 00:02:28,648
Could it be the vet?

10
00:02:28,731 --> 00:02:29,649
What?

11
00:02:30,775 --> 00:02:33,695
What are you talking about? It is not!

12
00:02:34,362 --> 00:02:36,531
Right. I'm sure it's not.

13
00:02:37,574 --> 00:02:39,450
Could it be Sang-hyeon then?

14
00:02:42,287 --> 00:02:44,122
I'm sure that's not it either.

15
00:02:45,957 --> 00:02:48,334
Then what could be
bothering our Officer Ahn?

16
00:02:50,795 --> 00:02:51,880
I have no clue.

17
00:03:18,907 --> 00:03:19,949
Little Doctor.

18
00:03:22,201 --> 00:03:24,120
-Excuse--
-Hello.

19
00:03:24,829 --> 00:03:27,874
Oh, my goodness.
What brings you little munchkins here?

20
00:03:27,957 --> 00:03:30,126
She says that Judy isn't eating.

21
00:03:30,209 --> 00:03:31,461
And she has diarrhea.

22
00:03:31,544 --> 00:03:33,296
-Judy?
-It's this one.

23
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:37,508
May I take a look?

24
00:03:46,935 --> 00:03:48,561
Judy isn't one year old yet, right?

25
00:03:49,187 --> 00:03:51,105
She's three months old.

26
00:03:53,316 --> 00:03:56,736
She's too skinny.
When did she start having diarrhea?

27
00:03:56,819 --> 00:03:58,529
Two days ago.

28
00:04:00,198 --> 00:04:01,699
Is my Judy going to die?

29
00:04:02,492 --> 00:04:03,326
What?

30
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:07,413
My mom keeps telling me
that she'll buy me a new rabbit.

31
00:04:08,331 --> 00:04:11,376
I don't need a rabbit
other than Judy, doctor.

32
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:14,170
I have a lot of allowance money saved up.

33
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:17,757
Please save my Judy.

34
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:23,972
Let me see what's wrong with her first,
then I'll do my best to help her.

35
00:04:24,555 --> 00:04:26,349
So stop crying now. Come on.

36
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:27,725
Yes, stop crying.

37
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:33,189
While the doctor checks on Judy,
you two go get yourselves some popsicles.

38
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:35,316
Seon-dong. Take good care of her, okay?

39
00:04:37,193 --> 00:04:38,903
I'm better at taking care of people.

40
00:04:40,238 --> 00:04:42,240
Anyway, thank you.

41
00:04:42,323 --> 00:04:43,241
Sure.

42
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:53,876
Why aren't you going with her?

43
00:04:54,836 --> 00:04:56,337
Thank you.

44
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:58,047
Sure.

45
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:01,592
Did they fight?

46
00:05:03,761 --> 00:05:05,722
We should check
for infections first, right?

47
00:05:19,277 --> 00:05:20,153
What are you doing?

48
00:05:23,865 --> 00:05:26,451
It's been a while
since I treated such a small animal.

49
00:05:27,201 --> 00:05:30,246
In Seoul, I only treated animals
that I could hold in my hands.

50
00:05:31,914 --> 00:05:34,125
The small humans outside are also waiting.

51
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:35,585
So hurry up, please.

52
00:05:36,461 --> 00:05:37,503
I will.

53
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:41,215
Please hold her.

54
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:53,686
Sorry for the wait.

55
00:05:54,604 --> 00:05:56,981
No, just stay seated.

56
00:06:08,701 --> 00:06:11,662
Fortunately, Judy doesn't have
any parasites or other problems,

57
00:06:12,288 --> 00:06:15,124
but she's very dehydrated,
so I'll give her fluids.

58
00:06:16,167 --> 00:06:19,879
I'll have to keep her here for a while
to monitor her condition afterward.

59
00:06:19,962 --> 00:06:22,882
-Could you come back later?
-Yes.

60
00:06:22,965 --> 00:06:25,510
I don't care how long it takes.

61
00:06:26,177 --> 00:06:28,221
But my Judy really is
going to be okay, right?

62
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:29,889
Of course.

63
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:34,185
Did you feed her any fruit by any chance?

64
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:40,441
I fed her some pear that I was eating.

65
00:06:41,317 --> 00:06:42,819
She's still a young rabbit,

66
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:45,571
so she can get sick
from eating something juicy.

67
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:49,992
From now on, give her
dry grass or rabbit food only.

68
00:06:50,535 --> 00:06:51,994
-Can you do that?
-Yes.

69
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:54,831
See? I told you she'd be okay.

70
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,551
I'll call you when she's ready.
Are you going home?

71
00:07:06,634 --> 00:07:07,593
No.

72
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:11,889
Ga-on's house is close by.
I can hang out there.

73
00:07:13,558 --> 00:07:17,061
He's very smart and meticulous.

74
00:07:17,145 --> 00:07:20,898
He remembers everything,
like where we've gone and what we've done.

75
00:07:23,609 --> 00:07:24,485
Is that so?

76
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:26,154
That's amazing.

77
00:07:26,237 --> 00:07:29,365
I'll be back later then.

78
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:31,033
Thank you.

79
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:32,869
No problem. See you.

80
00:07:45,673 --> 00:07:46,549
Did you two fight?

81
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:51,304
Doctor.

82
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:54,515
Why am I so dumb?

83
00:07:58,269 --> 00:08:00,480
Do you know what a manito is?

84
00:08:01,105 --> 00:08:03,191
I know, isn't it like a Secret Santa?

85
00:08:03,274 --> 00:08:05,818
We do that every year at school,

86
00:08:05,902 --> 00:08:09,947
and in first grade, Hui-won was my manito.

87
00:08:10,031 --> 00:08:11,991
-Right.
-I was talking with friends

88
00:08:12,074 --> 00:08:14,118
about things we'd exchanged,

89
00:08:14,202 --> 00:08:16,579
and Hui-won asked,

90
00:08:16,662 --> 00:08:18,539
"My gift was the best, right?"

91
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:23,044
And I was stupid enough to say,

92
00:08:23,127 --> 00:08:24,754
"What was the gift?"

93
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:26,464
I'm such a fool!

94
00:08:31,636 --> 00:08:36,015
Meanwhile, Kim Ga-on even remembers
the color of the raffle ticket he drew.

95
00:08:36,641 --> 00:08:41,062
But honestly, the book she gave me was
really boring.

96
00:08:44,232 --> 00:08:45,358
So it was a book.

97
00:08:45,441 --> 00:08:49,654
But it was a gift from the girl I like.
I should have remembered it.

98
00:08:50,404 --> 00:08:51,572
I know I'm in the wrong.

99
00:08:53,574 --> 00:08:56,035
Gosh, I can't believe I forgot.

100
00:08:58,079 --> 00:08:59,455
-You like her?
-Yes.

101
00:09:00,248 --> 00:09:01,958
Sang-hyeon told me that

102
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:05,545
if I'm constantly curious
and worried about her, I must like her.

103
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:11,509
How can I get her to forgive me, doctor?

104
00:09:12,343 --> 00:09:14,470
She said her rabbit was sick,

105
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:19,100
so I told her that I was close with you
and convinced her to come here.

106
00:09:19,684 --> 00:09:22,770
But the more I talk to her,
the worse things get.

107
00:09:26,857 --> 00:09:27,733
Here's an idea.

108
00:09:30,444 --> 00:09:32,530
How about just not talking to her
for a while?

109
00:09:33,781 --> 00:09:35,449
Give her some time.

110
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:39,787
Some angry feelings go away
after you think about them on your own.

111
00:09:40,371 --> 00:09:45,084
The things you say to appease her
might be making things worse.

112
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:49,005
I think you're right.

113
00:09:49,505 --> 00:09:52,466
She glares at me
every time I say something.

114
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:55,344
So if I don't,
at least she won't glare at me.

115
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:58,639
I'll try doing that.

116
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,601
Okay. Good luck.

117
00:10:03,185 --> 00:10:04,604
-Thank you, doctor.
-Sure.

118
00:10:04,687 --> 00:10:06,105
I'll get going too.

119
00:10:06,814 --> 00:10:09,191
I can't leave her alone with Ga-on
for too long.

120
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:10,818
He's handsome.

121
00:10:12,194 --> 00:10:13,279
Okay.

122
00:10:14,155 --> 00:10:15,281
Wait.

123
00:10:15,906 --> 00:10:18,784
-This morning, I didn't see…
-See what?

124
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,288
You.

125
00:10:22,371 --> 00:10:25,833
I didn't see you, so I was worried
that you were late for school.

126
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:29,378
Summer break started today,
so there's no school.

127
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,131
You were worried about me?

128
00:10:32,214 --> 00:10:34,175
You're much nicer than I thought.

129
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:49,023
Have you been…

130
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:51,400
well?

131
00:11:04,455 --> 00:11:06,582
OFFICER AHN

132
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:12,129
Doctor, there's a cow that's been in labor
for a whole day without giving birth.

133
00:11:13,881 --> 00:11:14,715
Okay.

134
00:11:16,717 --> 00:11:18,219
So it's been decided?

135
00:11:19,762 --> 00:11:22,515
Oh, no. Aunt Se-ryeon must be so upset.

136
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:27,520
Then we shouldn't talk about
Majeong for a while.

137
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:30,064
Okay.

138
00:11:30,606 --> 00:11:32,274
Thank you, Aunt Gyeong-ok.

139
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:33,401
Okay.

140
00:11:33,984 --> 00:11:34,985
What is it now?

141
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:38,030
The National Singing Contest.

142
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:39,907
It's going to be held in Majeong.

143
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:41,909
Oh, no.

144
00:11:41,992 --> 00:11:44,495
I can almost hear Jang Se-ryeon fuming.

145
00:11:44,578 --> 00:11:47,373
So we have to go all the way to Majeong
to watch it?

146
00:11:47,456 --> 00:11:50,876
If you go there to watch,
you'll be signing your own death warrant.

147
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:54,046
Why? Can't I go and watch?

148
00:11:55,506 --> 00:11:56,966
Am I not allowed to go?

149
00:12:03,514 --> 00:12:05,433
Gosh, I'm so mad!

150
00:12:05,516 --> 00:12:08,769
It's so annoying! It's infuriating!

151
00:12:09,353 --> 00:12:11,981
I'm not watching that show again
from this moment on!

152
00:12:12,064 --> 00:12:14,692
Those TV station people
seriously lack judgment!

153
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:18,696
Park Mal-geum's soles must be all worn out

154
00:12:18,779 --> 00:12:20,614
from dancing in celebration all day.

155
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:25,244
If we lose
the specialization funds to them too,

156
00:12:25,828 --> 00:12:29,373
I'm going to move out of Huidong.

157
00:12:29,457 --> 00:12:33,544
It'd be so humiliating
whenever I run into that bitch.

158
00:12:33,627 --> 00:12:35,045
I won't live here!

159
00:12:35,129 --> 00:12:38,007
Why would you leave? What about us?

160
00:12:38,757 --> 00:12:40,926
-Should I poison her food?
-What?

161
00:12:41,844 --> 00:12:44,180
Let's stay within the bounds
of the law, okay?

162
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:46,098
Let's focus on getting the funds.

163
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:49,143
If we have non-stop meetings
with the Young Men's Association,

164
00:12:49,226 --> 00:12:51,353
we should find some kind of solution.

165
00:12:51,979 --> 00:12:52,813
What?

166
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:56,817
So what happened
when you did as the doctor said?

167
00:12:57,443 --> 00:12:59,570
She's not glaring at me anymore,

168
00:12:59,653 --> 00:13:01,530
but she doesn't look at me at all now.

169
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:02,990
It's like I'm totally invisible.

170
00:13:05,784 --> 00:13:06,827
Seriously.

171
00:13:07,536 --> 00:13:08,454
Kim Seon-dong.

172
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:10,873
Have I taught you nothing?

173
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:13,417
You obviously know why Hui-won is upset.

174
00:13:14,084 --> 00:13:16,462
Then just say,
"It's been a long time, so I forgot."

175
00:13:16,545 --> 00:13:18,005
"I'm sorry for not remembering."

176
00:13:18,088 --> 00:13:21,258
That's what you should do.
Why would you listen to that nonsense?

177
00:13:21,342 --> 00:13:23,219
Why are you getting upset too?

178
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:25,596
No, I'm not upset.

179
00:13:26,222 --> 00:13:27,765
It's just frustrating, that's all.

180
00:13:28,432 --> 00:13:30,809
It's not like you don't know
why she's angry.

181
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:34,688
If you know why, you should just be honest
and tell her you're sorry.

182
00:13:34,772 --> 00:13:36,732
So why choose the more difficult path?

183
00:13:36,815 --> 00:13:41,529
I told her I was sorry at school
and on the way to the hospital.

184
00:13:42,404 --> 00:13:44,698
But she was like, "Whatever. bite me."

185
00:13:48,577 --> 00:13:50,037
Her rabbit was sick,

186
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:52,623
so she was probably
too upset to accept your apologies.

187
00:13:52,706 --> 00:13:56,835
And if she's upset because of you
and you don't do anything about it,

188
00:13:57,586 --> 00:13:59,296
won't she get even more upset?

189
00:14:00,047 --> 00:14:04,260
"I am still sorry about what I did.
I want to stay friends with you."

190
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:07,263
You have to show her how you really feel.

191
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:11,725
Love is not easy.

192
00:14:14,645 --> 00:14:16,855
Okay, I'll try that.

193
00:14:18,315 --> 00:14:19,358
That's a good boy.

194
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:22,570
Yes, that's the Kim Seon-dong I know.

195
00:14:40,462 --> 00:14:44,425
HAN DEOK-JIN VETERINARY HOSPITAL

196
00:14:50,973 --> 00:14:52,308
Doctor.

197
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:56,645
You and Ja-young ruined everything!

198
00:14:57,897 --> 00:14:59,064
Seon-dong.

199
00:15:01,859 --> 00:15:04,653
Seon-dong.
You said you liked hot chocolate, right?

200
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:05,738
Here.

201
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:16,874
So what happened
when you did as Ja-young told you?

202
00:15:19,627 --> 00:15:21,629
She asked if I had a split personality

203
00:15:21,712 --> 00:15:24,465
and why I kept changing my attitude.

204
00:15:27,885 --> 00:15:30,012
She said she wouldn't
hang out with me anymore.

205
00:15:33,974 --> 00:15:35,392
What did you do?

206
00:15:35,476 --> 00:15:37,603
You should have waited like I told you.

207
00:15:38,896 --> 00:15:44,485
When I didn't say anything to her,
she also didn't say anything to me.

208
00:15:45,402 --> 00:15:48,030
When I listened to Ja-young,
her words made sense.

209
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:51,867
So I told her I was sorry over ten times,

210
00:15:53,494 --> 00:15:55,329
and she asked if I was mocking her.

211
00:15:56,163 --> 00:15:59,917
When I said you should wait,
I literally meant you should take some…

212
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:07,007
Did Ja-young really tell you to say sorry
until she accepts your apology?

213
00:16:07,091 --> 00:16:10,719
She said that doing nothing would
just make things worse.

214
00:16:11,553 --> 00:16:13,764
And that what you said was nonsense.

215
00:16:16,767 --> 00:16:18,268
I mean, what are you…

216
00:16:22,523 --> 00:16:26,527
It happened a year ago.
It's understandable that you forgot.

217
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:29,446
Plus, it's not like you completely forgot.
You just couldn't remember.

218
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:31,323
Why would you be sorry?

219
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:34,368
Why are you getting upset, doctor?

220
00:16:37,621 --> 00:16:38,831
I'm not getting upset.

221
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:42,084
I'm just taking your side.

222
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:43,794
From your perspective.

223
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:54,388
Seon-dong.

224
00:16:55,305 --> 00:16:58,308
Let's try my idea again.

225
00:16:58,392 --> 00:16:59,226
And let's be firm.

226
00:17:00,811 --> 00:17:02,438
You've apologized enough.

227
00:17:03,147 --> 00:17:06,025
"I sincerely apologized,
but you still won't hang out with me.

228
00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:09,361
So okay. It saddens me,
but we'll do as you say."

229
00:17:09,945 --> 00:17:11,447
That's your stance.

230
00:17:12,614 --> 00:17:15,993
You won't have to see her anyway
since it's summer break.

231
00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:20,456
What if she doesn't contact me
until the summer break is over?

232
00:17:21,123 --> 00:17:24,334
In my experience, if you're out of sight,
she's bound to be concerned.

233
00:17:25,794 --> 00:17:28,297
But you have to be patient, okay?

234
00:17:29,006 --> 00:17:30,799
Don't say anything else to her.

235
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:38,599
You said you had a girlfriend, right?

236
00:17:40,934 --> 00:17:43,353
Well, I…

237
00:17:43,437 --> 00:17:46,482
I guess I should listen to the person
with experience.

238
00:17:47,649 --> 00:17:51,904
Ja-young has never even had a boyfriend.

239
00:17:54,406 --> 00:17:55,282
Really?

240
00:17:57,618 --> 00:17:58,702
I'm going to go now.

241
00:18:00,621 --> 00:18:02,164
Thanks for the hot chocolate.

242
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:03,916
-Let's do this.
-Let's do this.

243
00:18:22,893 --> 00:18:24,061
HUIDONG STONEWALL TRAIL

244
00:18:52,005 --> 00:18:52,965
It's done.

245
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:03,433
Hello.

246
00:19:11,191 --> 00:19:12,067
I…

247
00:19:14,361 --> 00:19:17,364
I didn't get a chance
to say this yesterday,

248
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,159
but thank you for helping me
after the accident.

249
00:19:21,076 --> 00:19:24,163
I should have thanked you sooner,
but I missed the timing.

250
00:19:29,126 --> 00:19:29,960
Sure.

251
00:19:30,794 --> 00:19:34,923
But some things still need to be said,
even if the timing isn't right.

252
00:19:35,591 --> 00:19:39,511
Especially with things like
"thank you" or "sorry."

253
00:19:42,389 --> 00:19:44,391
And some things don't need to be said.

254
00:19:46,143 --> 00:19:49,897
Like when you just said, "Thank you."
I didn't have to hear it to know.

255
00:19:51,356 --> 00:19:53,817
I'd like to say it regardless.

256
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:56,361
Thank you.

257
00:20:02,117 --> 00:20:03,410
Yesterday, I was…

258
00:20:03,493 --> 00:20:04,953
Visiting the barn?

259
00:20:08,332 --> 00:20:09,333
Yes.

260
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:12,920
Why didn't you come yesterday?

261
00:20:13,003 --> 00:20:14,296
I had a lot of beer ready.

262
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:18,175
I mean, it was raining and everything.

263
00:20:24,097 --> 00:20:25,474
So there was no other reason?

264
00:20:26,308 --> 00:20:28,101
No, nothing like that.

265
00:20:28,185 --> 00:20:29,811
I just passed out at home.

266
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:32,522
Let's put them up.
I replaced all the bulbs.

267
00:20:32,606 --> 00:20:34,358
Sure. Let's.

268
00:20:34,983 --> 00:20:36,860
I'll be on my way then.

269
00:20:50,624 --> 00:20:51,541
Tell me.

270
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:52,709
Tell you what?

271
00:20:52,793 --> 00:20:54,544
You know what I'm talking about.

272
00:21:00,842 --> 00:21:03,679
He remembered.

273
00:21:04,221 --> 00:21:05,514
The guy from Seoul.

274
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:07,683
At last.

275
00:21:08,976 --> 00:21:10,310
At last what?

276
00:21:12,813 --> 00:21:15,607
You were fussing
about being secret friends.

277
00:21:16,358 --> 00:21:18,902
Why are you so lukewarm
when you both remember now?

278
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:21,071
I know, right?

279
00:21:22,072 --> 00:21:24,408
I thought there would be
a lot to talk about.

280
00:21:24,992 --> 00:21:26,702
But strangely, there wasn't.

281
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:28,453
It just became awkward.

282
00:21:31,331 --> 00:21:32,791
It's all in the past now.

283
00:21:33,542 --> 00:21:34,710
It's kind of unnecessary.

284
00:21:35,377 --> 00:21:38,880
I won't ever see him again
once he goes back.

285
00:21:39,506 --> 00:21:40,924
There's no point now,

286
00:21:42,092 --> 00:21:43,176
Why bother?

287
00:21:43,844 --> 00:21:44,803
You're right.

288
00:21:45,429 --> 00:21:47,014
You were just kids back then.

289
00:21:48,098 --> 00:21:49,141
Why bother?

290
00:21:53,562 --> 00:21:55,689
I'm going to Seoul to meet a client.

291
00:21:56,231 --> 00:21:58,400
Let me know if you need something.
I'll get it.

292
00:21:59,609 --> 00:22:01,486
It's not like you're going overseas.

293
00:22:02,446 --> 00:22:03,488
I'm just worried.

294
00:22:05,198 --> 00:22:07,534
What are you worried about? I'm not a kid.

295
00:22:12,122 --> 00:22:13,206
All right, then.

296
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:18,837
Be good while I'm away.

297
00:22:19,463 --> 00:22:20,547
Hey!

298
00:22:28,013 --> 00:22:30,348
Doctor, I'm stepping out for a second.

299
00:22:30,432 --> 00:22:31,850
Okay, see you later.

300
00:22:37,105 --> 00:22:37,981
What is it?

301
00:22:38,565 --> 00:22:40,025
Is everything okay?

302
00:22:40,525 --> 00:22:43,028
Of course. Everything's fine.

303
00:22:43,111 --> 00:22:45,739
Then why do you sound so down?

304
00:22:45,822 --> 00:22:48,158
Is that Officer Ahn still bothering you?

305
00:22:51,828 --> 00:22:54,581
Has this happened to you?

306
00:22:55,165 --> 00:22:58,752
You meet a stranger,
but they turn out to be someone you knew.

307
00:22:58,835 --> 00:23:00,045
What does that even mean?

308
00:23:00,879 --> 00:23:03,423
Are you saying you knew her
but you didn't recognize her?

309
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:05,092
I guess.

310
00:23:05,175 --> 00:23:06,802
And she recognized you?

311
00:23:07,511 --> 00:23:09,304
I guess.

312
00:23:09,387 --> 00:23:14,101
I guess that could happen with you
since you're so indifferent about others.

313
00:23:14,184 --> 00:23:17,687
But I have a sharp eye,
so I'd definitely recognize someone.

314
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:21,983
You know, she must not have
such great memories of you.

315
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:23,944
She's been pretending
she doesn't know you.

316
00:23:24,569 --> 00:23:26,113
No, there's no way…

317
00:23:26,655 --> 00:23:27,489
Could there be?

318
00:23:27,572 --> 00:23:28,782
Anyway, what about it?

319
00:23:29,282 --> 00:23:31,993
Does she look different
now that you recognize them?

320
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:36,081
Aren't people usually like that?

321
00:23:37,249 --> 00:23:39,835
Once you realize
that they aren't a total stranger,

322
00:23:39,918 --> 00:23:42,170
they look more…

323
00:23:43,088 --> 00:23:44,089
You know, more…

324
00:23:44,172 --> 00:23:46,466
-They look better?
-That's right.

325
00:23:47,092 --> 00:23:50,387
Wait, what?
I didn't mean in a romantic way.

326
00:23:51,513 --> 00:23:53,515
Just as a person to another.

327
00:23:54,141 --> 00:23:58,478
Don't people generally think better
of people they know?

328
00:23:59,229 --> 00:24:00,480
That's what I mean.

329
00:24:00,564 --> 00:24:02,649
You think better of Officer Ahn now?

330
00:24:02,732 --> 00:24:04,526
-What?
-Unbelievable.

331
00:24:04,609 --> 00:24:07,279
So she knew you all this time, right?

332
00:24:07,362 --> 00:24:09,030
And she acted like she didn't?

333
00:24:09,865 --> 00:24:11,199
Seriously.

334
00:24:11,741 --> 00:24:13,910
You must have been an absolute jerk.

335
00:24:16,163 --> 00:24:17,706
So how do you know her?

336
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:19,457
When I was a kid…

337
00:24:20,167 --> 00:24:22,377
When we were kids, we played together.

338
00:24:24,087 --> 00:24:25,922
I see.

339
00:24:26,923 --> 00:24:29,259
Now, this is the most important part.

340
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:31,219
Is she pretty?

341
00:24:36,975 --> 00:24:37,851
Doctor.

342
00:24:37,934 --> 00:24:39,978
Welcome back. Where's Seon-dong?

343
00:24:46,651 --> 00:24:48,403
He won't even answer his phone.

344
00:24:49,696 --> 00:24:51,323
What's wrong with him?

345
00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:56,536
I'll disappear as you wish.
Don't look for me. Goodbye.

346
00:24:57,078 --> 00:25:00,582
SANDEUL POLICE STATION

347
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:03,919
-Do you happen to know…
-My goodness.

348
00:25:04,002 --> 00:25:06,504
…any place Seon-dong might go to
besides his home?

349
00:25:06,588 --> 00:25:07,714
-What?
-Who?

350
00:25:07,797 --> 00:25:08,798
Why all of a sudden?

351
00:25:09,424 --> 00:25:10,884
He texted Hui-won

352
00:25:10,967 --> 00:25:13,261
telling her not to look for him
and disappeared.

353
00:25:13,803 --> 00:25:15,889
I just checked his home,
and he's not there yet.

354
00:25:15,972 --> 00:25:18,600
He's not answering
my calls or his grandmother's.

355
00:25:19,684 --> 00:25:22,354
Hopefully he's just
hanging out somewhere, but…

356
00:25:23,104 --> 00:25:26,274
What is going on here?
Did you look everywhere?

357
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:28,735
-Yes.
-Jeez, this kid…

358
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:30,695
-It's quite late.
-He's not answering?

359
00:25:30,779 --> 00:25:31,780
No.

360
00:25:32,697 --> 00:25:33,907
My goodness.

361
00:25:37,035 --> 00:25:38,411
Yes, ma'am.

362
00:25:38,495 --> 00:25:40,372
Yes, I just heard.

363
00:25:40,455 --> 00:25:41,498
It's probably nothing.

364
00:25:41,581 --> 00:25:44,918
I'll find him quickly and take him home,
so don't worry too much.

365
00:25:45,627 --> 00:25:46,628
Okay.

366
00:25:47,295 --> 00:25:49,256
Maybe he's just playing somewhere.

367
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:53,009
He was depressed all day.
He was having problems with a friend.

368
00:25:53,802 --> 00:25:56,596
But even then,
he's not the type to act like this.

369
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:59,808
He said not to look for him.
He must have run away from home.

370
00:25:59,891 --> 00:26:01,184
Should I broadcast it?

371
00:26:01,268 --> 00:26:02,102
-Sure.
-Yes, sir.

372
00:26:02,185 --> 00:26:05,272
Let's go look for him.
How far could he have gone?

373
00:26:06,564 --> 00:26:08,191
Is there anything you know?

374
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:13,029
That's…

375
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:19,452
Huidong residents,
Huidong Elementary School second-grader

376
00:26:19,536 --> 00:26:23,206
Kim Seon-dong has not returned home yet.

377
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:25,792
His grandmother is worried sick.

378
00:26:26,376 --> 00:26:31,631
If you see Kim Seon-dong,
please call me or the police station.

379
00:26:33,091 --> 00:26:34,384
Seon-dong!

380
00:26:34,467 --> 00:26:37,012
If you're out playing,
hurry up and go home, okay?

381
00:26:37,095 --> 00:26:38,847
I repeat.

382
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:40,056
Seon-dong!

383
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:42,017
If you see Seon-dong…

384
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:44,894
How could you give him advice like that?

385
00:26:45,603 --> 00:26:47,188
It's obviously a misunderstanding.

386
00:26:47,272 --> 00:26:49,482
I didn't tell him to run away from home.

387
00:26:49,566 --> 00:26:52,610
He's just nine.
Of course he wouldn't understand!

388
00:26:53,111 --> 00:26:56,698
Staying out of her sight?
How did you think he'd interpret that?

389
00:26:56,781 --> 00:26:58,450
Now he's done this.

390
00:26:58,533 --> 00:27:00,535
Yes, I guess you have a point.

391
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:03,663
I agree that I'm partially responsible.

392
00:27:03,747 --> 00:27:08,084
I meant that he should keep some distance
from Hui-won, but not like this.

393
00:27:09,711 --> 00:27:12,630
Frankly, I only told him that

394
00:27:12,714 --> 00:27:16,009
because he said following your advice
ruined everything.

395
00:27:16,092 --> 00:27:18,428
Because she wouldn't accept his apologies.

396
00:27:20,096 --> 00:27:23,641
Feelings are bound to get hurt
if you don't talk it out.

397
00:27:23,725 --> 00:27:27,854
They might say some harsh things,
but it's better to apologize and make up.

398
00:27:27,937 --> 00:27:30,982
You think it's better to wait it out
until the other person gets tired?

399
00:27:31,691 --> 00:27:33,902
But the timing matters.

400
00:27:33,985 --> 00:27:36,029
If the other person isn't
ready to accept it,

401
00:27:36,112 --> 00:27:38,656
you can't just keep saying
what you need to say.

402
00:27:40,575 --> 00:27:44,120
"I am very uncomfortable,
so accept my apology already."

403
00:27:44,871 --> 00:27:46,164
That's just unreasonable.

404
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:49,125
How could you process it like that?

405
00:27:49,834 --> 00:27:53,963
You have to say you're sorry
for them to know and understand.

406
00:27:54,047 --> 00:27:56,508
A girl he likes is angry because of him,

407
00:27:56,591 --> 00:27:59,344
and you told him to do nothing
because he's apologized enough?

408
00:27:59,969 --> 00:28:02,305
I mean, that's just so like you.

409
00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:04,891
Seon-dong!

410
00:28:04,974 --> 00:28:06,017
I mean,

411
00:28:06,101 --> 00:28:07,894
he said he was sorry.

412
00:28:07,977 --> 00:28:11,272
He's done all he could
and it still wasn't enough.

413
00:28:11,356 --> 00:28:15,860
Wouldn't it be better
to at least make her worry about him?

414
00:28:15,944 --> 00:28:18,613
Sure, you did a terrific job
teaching an innocent kid

415
00:28:18,696 --> 00:28:20,115
how to play hard-to-get.

416
00:28:20,198 --> 00:28:21,825
Can you even call it proper love

417
00:28:21,908 --> 00:28:24,661
if you're keeping distance
and being calculative?

418
00:28:25,245 --> 00:28:28,957
I don't know how you do relationships,
but I wouldn't teach anyone to do that.

419
00:28:30,083 --> 00:28:32,752
Hold on. What about you?

420
00:28:32,836 --> 00:28:36,005
You sure sound like an expert.
How are you doing in that department?

421
00:28:36,673 --> 00:28:38,758
"Proper love." Give me a break.

422
00:28:38,842 --> 00:28:40,760
You've never been in a relationship.

423
00:28:40,844 --> 00:28:41,970
What did you say?

424
00:28:43,638 --> 00:28:45,890
I'd rather not date anyone
than do it your way.

425
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:49,519
Have you been in a relationship with me?

426
00:28:50,311 --> 00:28:51,646
You don't know anything.

427
00:28:55,817 --> 00:28:56,776
I mean,

428
00:28:57,485 --> 00:28:58,820
what I'm saying is…

429
00:29:00,905 --> 00:29:02,240
Yes, Chief.

430
00:29:03,241 --> 00:29:05,493
Really? Yes, I know where that is.

431
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:06,953
I'll be there right away.

432
00:29:07,787 --> 00:29:08,663
Did they find him?

433
00:29:08,747 --> 00:29:10,832
He's been on the bus
that circles the village.

434
00:29:10,915 --> 00:29:13,293
He wouldn't get off,
so the driver called the police.

435
00:29:13,376 --> 00:29:14,544
Let's go to town first.

436
00:29:15,295 --> 00:29:16,463
Okay.

437
00:29:31,561 --> 00:29:35,440
The apology should have been
more sincere, right?

438
00:29:42,405 --> 00:29:45,992
I'm talking about Seon-dong and Hui-won.

439
00:29:51,498 --> 00:29:55,585
Seon-dong should have apologized
more sincerely,

440
00:29:56,836 --> 00:30:00,256
but I don't think Hui-won said
she wouldn't hang out with Seon-dong

441
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:02,008
because she really hated him.

442
00:30:02,884 --> 00:30:04,219
She kept snapping at him,

443
00:30:05,053 --> 00:30:08,306
but I'm sure she eventually realized
how sorry he was.

444
00:30:08,389 --> 00:30:10,141
Don't you agree?

445
00:30:14,521 --> 00:30:15,730
The thing is,

446
00:30:17,106 --> 00:30:21,945
your coaching wasn't exactly
great advice for a nine-year-old,

447
00:30:23,029 --> 00:30:24,447
but it may not be all wrong.

448
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:29,619
Nothing's more concerning
than to have someone disappear.

449
00:30:32,956 --> 00:30:34,457
Were you concerned too?

450
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:36,751
Officer Ahn?

451
00:30:43,299 --> 00:30:44,217
Yes.

452
00:30:45,051 --> 00:30:45,885
Of course.

453
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:49,806
A child went missing.

454
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:57,063
I'm not talking about…

455
00:31:03,528 --> 00:31:04,445
Never mind.

456
00:31:29,012 --> 00:31:29,846
Seon-dong.

457
00:31:32,348 --> 00:31:33,182
Kim Seon-dong.

458
00:31:35,768 --> 00:31:36,686
Ja-young.

459
00:31:41,274 --> 00:31:43,943
You brat. What are you doing out here?

460
00:31:44,027 --> 00:31:45,528
Were you planning on not going home?

461
00:31:46,821 --> 00:31:47,655
Doctor.

462
00:31:50,074 --> 00:31:52,911
Hui-won's not angry anymore.
She says you can contact her.

463
00:31:53,745 --> 00:31:54,829
Really?

464
00:31:54,913 --> 00:31:56,539
Doctor, you're awesome!

465
00:31:57,999 --> 00:31:59,292
You little punk!

466
00:31:59,834 --> 00:32:00,877
Ja-young.

467
00:32:01,586 --> 00:32:02,629
Don't ever do this again.

468
00:32:47,298 --> 00:32:48,216
Have you been…

469
00:32:49,425 --> 00:32:50,593
well?

470
00:32:56,265 --> 00:32:58,059
We parted so suddenly,

471
00:32:59,352 --> 00:33:03,523
that I thought I'd have a lot to say
when we met again.

472
00:33:04,607 --> 00:33:05,858
But I forget.

473
00:33:08,236 --> 00:33:10,613
Say something.

474
00:33:13,282 --> 00:33:17,120
But then again,
I did all the talking back then.

475
00:33:18,955 --> 00:33:21,791
How long have you known?

476
00:33:24,544 --> 00:33:27,338
You wrote me your name when you left.

477
00:33:28,047 --> 00:33:29,173
On that book.

478
00:33:29,799 --> 00:33:32,343
Also, you're Director Han's only grandson.

479
00:33:37,306 --> 00:33:40,560
So I was the only one
who completely forgot.

480
00:33:41,477 --> 00:33:43,229
It has been a long time.

481
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:46,482
You weren't exactly here
on a good occasion.

482
00:33:50,987 --> 00:33:54,741
And it's not like I couldn't stop
thinking about you all this time.

483
00:33:54,824 --> 00:33:59,328
I'd forgotten, but I remembered
when I saw your face and heard your name.

484
00:34:05,376 --> 00:34:07,170
This village is still the same, isn't it?

485
00:34:08,046 --> 00:34:09,297
Nothing's changed.

486
00:34:10,214 --> 00:34:11,758
This place is also the same.

487
00:34:18,306 --> 00:34:19,724
I think a lot has changed.

488
00:34:21,434 --> 00:34:22,685
With you, Officer Ahn.

489
00:34:28,357 --> 00:34:29,442
Since I've grown old?

490
00:34:35,823 --> 00:34:38,326
It looks like it's going to rain.

491
00:34:39,285 --> 00:34:41,871
Let's talk later. You should get home.

492
00:34:42,371 --> 00:34:43,372
What?

493
00:35:01,224 --> 00:35:03,142
Why are you still here?

494
00:35:03,851 --> 00:35:05,645
Did Seon-dong get home safely?

495
00:35:06,479 --> 00:35:10,858
Yes. His grandma slapped
his back a little, though.

496
00:35:12,193 --> 00:35:14,737
Thanks to you,
I learned a new technique as well.

497
00:35:15,446 --> 00:35:18,658
I'm going to try it
when a relationship doesn't go well.

498
00:35:18,741 --> 00:35:19,992
Keeping distance.

499
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:28,209
I was just joking.

500
00:35:29,085 --> 00:35:31,045
Anyway, have a good night.

501
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:34,298
Wait.

502
00:35:42,265 --> 00:35:43,307
You were…

503
00:35:45,351 --> 00:35:47,186
the only good memory from that year.

504
00:35:53,734 --> 00:35:55,653
I'm sorry I forgot.

505
00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:02,326
Ahn Ja-young.

506
00:36:36,402 --> 00:36:38,571
I'm not the type to enjoy
spontaneous events, okay?

507
00:36:38,654 --> 00:36:40,114
It's so good.

508
00:36:40,198 --> 00:36:42,867
Despite all that, I don't hate it.

509
00:36:43,367 --> 00:36:44,410
What do you think is up with her?

510
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:46,037
Ji-yul!

511
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:47,330
Anyway, who is she?

512
00:36:47,413 --> 00:36:48,789
A woman.

513
00:36:48,873 --> 00:36:50,625
A young and pretty woman.

514
00:36:50,708 --> 00:36:53,836
Our bed-and-breakfast guest was
our vet's guest?

515
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:56,047
Your girlfriend must have missed you a lot

516
00:36:56,130 --> 00:36:57,340
to come all the way here.

517
00:36:57,423 --> 00:36:59,258
So who is that Officer Ahn?

518
00:36:59,342 --> 00:37:01,761
Besides, she is your first love.

519
00:37:01,844 --> 00:37:05,932
