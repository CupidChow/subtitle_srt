1
00:01:13,281 --> 00:01:15,533
See, this is just not very clear.

2
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:17,035
Jeez.

3
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:19,454
The number doesn't…

4
00:01:21,956 --> 00:01:22,957
Wait.

5
00:01:23,625 --> 00:01:25,168
Hang on. Let me do it, damn it.

6
00:01:26,377 --> 00:01:28,296
You're not doing it right.

7
00:01:28,379 --> 00:01:30,715
Chief, what do you think is up with her?

8
00:01:32,133 --> 00:01:34,469
Is she worried
someone will steal that old bike?

9
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:37,931
Does anyone steal anything
in this village, new or old?

10
00:01:38,014 --> 00:01:41,184
"As a police officer,
one must always have a suspicious mind."

11
00:01:41,267 --> 00:01:42,352
That's what you said.

12
00:01:42,435 --> 00:01:43,686
I'm suspicious of you.

13
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:45,897
Did you really pass
the police officer exam?

14
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:49,025
How did you even get married?
Are you sure you're actually married?

15
00:01:49,651 --> 00:01:51,110
Why? Are you getting married?

16
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:57,450
You were the only good memory
from that year.

17
00:01:58,118 --> 00:01:59,786
I'm sorry I forgot.

18
00:02:02,622 --> 00:02:03,748
Ahn Ja-young.

19
00:02:07,877 --> 00:02:09,087
You said

20
00:02:09,921 --> 00:02:12,799
important things should be said out loud.

21
00:02:17,178 --> 00:02:18,263
Yes.

22
00:02:18,847 --> 00:02:19,681
Okay.

23
00:02:20,932 --> 00:02:22,225
I understand,

24
00:02:23,226 --> 00:02:25,854
so let's talk later.

25
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:31,901
Just a second.

26
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,624
I'd offer to give you a ride,
but you'd probably decline.

27
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:48,960
It's really dark right now.

28
00:02:49,502 --> 00:02:51,713
-Take this bicycle.
-I'm fine.

29
00:02:57,385 --> 00:02:59,512
Maybe I should just give you a ride.

30
00:03:01,472 --> 00:03:02,307
No.

31
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:04,142
All right.

32
00:03:04,225 --> 00:03:05,852
I'll return it tomorrow.

33
00:03:06,436 --> 00:03:07,812
You can just go home.

34
00:03:09,981 --> 00:03:11,733
Go ahead, then.

35
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:13,484
Okay.

36
00:03:17,322 --> 00:03:18,239
It was great…

37
00:03:20,116 --> 00:03:21,117
to see you.

38
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:35,506
What was that?

39
00:03:37,175 --> 00:03:38,551
Is he mocking me?

40
00:04:11,292 --> 00:04:12,126
Did you hear?

41
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:14,837
The National Singing Contest will be
held in our village.

42
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:16,005
I heard.

43
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:19,634
I mean, it's a good thing for us.

44
00:04:19,717 --> 00:04:22,929
But they had a big fight again
over hosting that event.

45
00:04:23,012 --> 00:04:25,932
The Women's Association presidents were
pulling each other's hair out.

46
00:04:26,015 --> 00:04:27,892
I know, I heard.

47
00:04:27,976 --> 00:04:29,769
When Officer Ahn tried to stop them,

48
00:04:29,852 --> 00:04:33,648
she said that Officer Ahn is so impudent
because she has no parents.

49
00:04:33,731 --> 00:04:35,024
Oh, my gosh.

50
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:38,403
I mean, she didn't do anything wrong.
She just got caught in between.

51
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:41,030
The village is full of drama every day.

52
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:42,448
That vile woman…

53
00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:48,288
Doctor!

54
00:04:48,371 --> 00:04:49,455
Doctor!

55
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:51,165
-Doctor!
-Hello.

56
00:04:51,249 --> 00:04:52,083
Doctor!

57
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:53,001
Oh, gosh.

58
00:04:53,668 --> 00:04:57,005
You said you were a dog veterinarian
in Seoul, right?

59
00:04:57,797 --> 00:04:58,631
Yes.

60
00:04:58,715 --> 00:05:00,758
Oh, gosh. Hallelujah.

61
00:05:00,842 --> 00:05:05,221
The heavens must have sent you
since I've been such a nice person.

62
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:07,181
Please take a look at my dog.

63
00:05:07,265 --> 00:05:10,143
It's gravely ill. I don't know what to do.

64
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:11,561
What?

65
00:05:11,644 --> 00:05:14,897
Her mother lives alone in Gupyeong,

66
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:17,608
and her dog has fallen suddenly
and can't get back up.

67
00:05:18,276 --> 00:05:21,154
They've been contacting
nearby veterinary hospitals,

68
00:05:21,237 --> 00:05:23,156
but it's in such a remote area.

69
00:05:23,239 --> 00:05:26,951
Then she heard
that you were here in Majeong…

70
00:05:27,785 --> 00:05:28,953
Gupyeong?

71
00:05:29,787 --> 00:05:30,788
Where is Gupyeong?

72
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:33,791
It's about an hour's drive from here.

73
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:35,918
My mother is 95 this year.

74
00:05:36,711 --> 00:05:39,839
She raised that dog like her own child,
and now it's sick.

75
00:05:39,922 --> 00:05:43,342
She's crying her eyes out.
She will die at this rate.

76
00:05:43,968 --> 00:05:46,179
Please do this for me, doctor.

77
00:05:46,262 --> 00:05:49,057
Will you please go take a look, doctor?

78
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:53,019
But I have other work here…

79
00:05:53,644 --> 00:05:55,480
Can you spare about two hours?

80
00:05:56,898 --> 00:05:58,900
-I'm sorry?
-I know a shortcut.

81
00:05:58,983 --> 00:06:01,069
I can probably get you there
in 40 minutes.

82
00:06:06,282 --> 00:06:07,283
Just a moment.

83
00:06:07,366 --> 00:06:08,618
Let's have a word.

84
00:06:12,246 --> 00:06:15,917
Are you telling me to go
to another village to treat

85
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,544
the Majeong Women's Association
president's mother's dog?

86
00:06:18,628 --> 00:06:19,670
Yes.

87
00:06:21,422 --> 00:06:24,092
What if something urgent
happens in a barn here?

88
00:06:24,175 --> 00:06:26,886
Let's worry about that when it happens.
This is urgent.

89
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:30,306
Don't you resent her?

90
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:33,684
I mean, she always says
the most annoying things.

91
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:37,146
She says the most hurtful things
without even blinking

92
00:06:38,189 --> 00:06:40,733
and only plays nice
when she needs something.

93
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:46,531
I'll drive, okay?

94
00:06:46,614 --> 00:06:47,865
What did he say?

95
00:06:48,449 --> 00:06:50,118
-He says he can go.
-Oh, my gosh.

96
00:06:50,201 --> 00:06:52,203
So text me the address.

97
00:06:52,286 --> 00:06:53,246
-Okay.
-That's good news.

98
00:06:53,329 --> 00:06:54,997
I'll call the chief on the way.

99
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:56,582
Okay, go.

100
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:58,876
Thank you. Thank you so much.

101
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,044
Thank you.

102
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:01,587
You're welcome.

103
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:03,589
What are you doing? Get in.

104
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:05,466
Hurry up and go, please.

105
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:06,926
-Hurry.
-Thanks for doing this.

106
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,807
What is this?
You're practically kidnapping me.

107
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:16,644
Were you worried about me?

108
00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:20,731
You've changed.

109
00:07:20,815 --> 00:07:24,444
You used to say, "The dog is innocent.
It must be treated if it's sick."

110
00:07:26,195 --> 00:07:28,114
I haven't changed.

111
00:07:29,657 --> 00:07:31,242
I never said I wouldn't treat the dog.

112
00:07:31,993 --> 00:07:33,953
I just thought
that we should think it through

113
00:07:34,036 --> 00:07:36,622
since there's work to do here too.

114
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:39,125
So what if she's nice
only when she needs something?

115
00:07:39,876 --> 00:07:43,546
She can be mean sometimes,
but she's not that bad of a person.

116
00:07:44,172 --> 00:07:45,381
Some philanthropist you are.

117
00:07:46,424 --> 00:07:48,217
I'm going there primarily for the dog,

118
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:51,179
but also because I'm worried
about the old lady.

119
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:54,765
Now who's a philanthropist?

120
00:07:56,058 --> 00:07:56,934
Hold on.

121
00:07:57,935 --> 00:08:00,646
I thought I told you
I was a year older than you back then.

122
00:08:02,356 --> 00:08:06,444
Maybe I should talk down to you
from now on.

123
00:08:08,905 --> 00:08:11,157
I'd rather die than call you oppa, okay?

124
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,910
I never asked you to call me that.

125
00:08:14,911 --> 00:08:15,995
Jeez.

126
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:22,376
Are you okay?

127
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:28,049
Just address me casually.
You don't have to hurt me.

128
00:08:28,132 --> 00:08:29,467
You're okay.

129
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:32,553
It really hurts.

130
00:08:32,637 --> 00:08:34,805
You know I didn't do it on purpose.

131
00:08:35,389 --> 00:08:37,099
Do you think I did?

132
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:45,358
Doctor.

133
00:08:45,942 --> 00:08:47,902
Will my Doldol be okay?

134
00:08:47,985 --> 00:08:49,403
He'll be fine.

135
00:08:49,487 --> 00:08:50,821
Don't worry too much.

136
00:08:51,572 --> 00:08:53,699
I don't want my Doldol to be sick.

137
00:08:54,492 --> 00:08:55,368
Doldol.

138
00:08:56,118 --> 00:08:57,370
Oh, my.

139
00:08:57,453 --> 00:09:01,290
Doldol. Please don't be sick.

140
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:02,542
-Let me take a look.
-My goodness.

141
00:09:03,584 --> 00:09:04,710
What do I do?

142
00:09:10,174 --> 00:09:12,510
Doctor, thank you so much.

143
00:09:13,177 --> 00:09:14,679
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

144
00:09:14,762 --> 00:09:16,472
Take these for the ride back.

145
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:17,974
Thank you.

146
00:09:18,766 --> 00:09:19,600
Thank you.

147
00:09:19,684 --> 00:09:21,852
You should go on in.
Doldol must be waiting.

148
00:09:22,645 --> 00:09:24,063
Have a good day.

149
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:31,862
-Would you like some?
-Sure.

150
00:09:32,697 --> 00:09:34,031
It's hot.

151
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:40,746
It's so good.

152
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:42,915
Aren't you glad you came?

153
00:09:43,874 --> 00:09:46,335
I'll admit that the corn is good.

154
00:09:49,213 --> 00:09:50,631
Let's get going.

155
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:54,468
Let me drive on the way back.

156
00:09:54,552 --> 00:09:55,511
Okay.

157
00:10:02,059 --> 00:10:03,394
-What?
-What's wrong?

158
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,563
What the…

159
00:10:07,815 --> 00:10:08,691
What's this?

160
00:10:12,653 --> 00:10:15,323
It must have happened
when we went over that speed bump.

161
00:10:17,116 --> 00:10:19,076
It's completely torn.

162
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,162
We can't even patch it up.
What should we do?

163
00:10:22,246 --> 00:10:25,499
The repair shop is quite far from here.

164
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:27,209
One moment.

165
00:10:30,838 --> 00:10:33,716
This is the one product
I don't have in stock.

166
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:37,219
I could go get it for you.
Would you like to wait?

167
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:39,180
How long would it take?

168
00:10:39,263 --> 00:10:42,808
To go get the tire and replace it…
An hour and a half?

169
00:10:43,684 --> 00:10:46,103
We're right by the beach.
Why don't you go get some coffee?

170
00:10:52,943 --> 00:10:54,195
I'm sorry.

171
00:10:54,278 --> 00:10:57,198
I thought two hours would be enough
to go and come back.

172
00:10:57,281 --> 00:11:00,034
Weren't you the type to enjoy
the spontaneous things in life?

173
00:11:01,202 --> 00:11:03,412
I would if I were alone.

174
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:05,331
But I'm with a busy man right now.

175
00:11:06,248 --> 00:11:08,584
I dragged you all the way out here,

176
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:10,753
and now this happens. I mean…

177
00:11:12,046 --> 00:11:14,382
I came here because I'm a vet.

178
00:11:15,883 --> 00:11:18,928
-What?
-I don't get dragged around so easily.

179
00:11:20,262 --> 00:11:22,431
It's nice.
It's like I escaped for a moment.

180
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:26,185
Escape?
You must have really wanted to escape.

181
00:11:26,268 --> 00:11:27,561
From Huidong.

182
00:11:28,604 --> 00:11:32,358
I'll have you know that I'm not the type
to enjoy spontaneous events.

183
00:11:34,276 --> 00:11:36,737
I've never once gone against
Grandpa's words.

184
00:11:37,738 --> 00:11:39,115
But for the first time,

185
00:11:39,907 --> 00:11:41,450
I wanted to say no.

186
00:11:42,451 --> 00:11:44,453
The cows, the pigs, and even the people…

187
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:47,248
Nothing goes according to plan
around here.

188
00:11:47,331 --> 00:11:48,249
Like I said,

189
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:51,836
I'm sorry for making it worse.

190
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:53,712
Despite all that,

191
00:11:54,505 --> 00:11:57,258
I don't hate it. It's odd.

192
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:02,304
Thanks to you, I get to enjoy this view.

193
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:04,765
In a place I never expected to be,

194
00:12:04,849 --> 00:12:06,767
with someone I never expected to be with.

195
00:12:26,745 --> 00:12:28,956
-Have you tried the coconut shrimp?
-I haven't.

196
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:31,500
Let's try it.
It's supposed to be crispy and delicious.

197
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:33,794
No, I think the other one would be better.

198
00:12:33,878 --> 00:12:34,837
This one?

199
00:12:40,968 --> 00:12:41,886
It's so good!

200
00:12:44,221 --> 00:12:45,222
Which one's your favorite?

201
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:46,640
-This one?
-The potato.

202
00:12:46,724 --> 00:12:47,850
I like this one best.

203
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:12,708
You can drop me off over there.
It's close to the station.

204
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:15,127
I'm already driving.
I'll drop you off there.

205
00:13:25,888 --> 00:13:27,973
What the heck?
Who's speeding on a road like this?

206
00:13:28,057 --> 00:13:29,391
Maybe they're in a hurry.

207
00:13:52,248 --> 00:13:53,123
Thank you.

208
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:57,169
And I'm sorry to have put you
through so much today.

209
00:13:57,253 --> 00:13:58,837
Don't worry about it.

210
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:00,548
I had fun.

211
00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:04,593
Take care.

212
00:14:06,053 --> 00:14:07,179
You too.

213
00:14:08,472 --> 00:14:10,766
Excuse me, can I ask you a…

214
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:15,145
Ji-yul!

215
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:28,576
I can't believe I ran into you like this.

216
00:14:30,578 --> 00:14:31,495
What's going on?

217
00:14:32,454 --> 00:14:34,540
-What are you doing here?
-I missed you.

218
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:43,257
I'll be going now.

219
00:14:43,924 --> 00:14:45,217
Wait. Just a moment.

220
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:46,510
No, it's okay.

221
00:14:46,594 --> 00:14:48,178
I'll let you two alone.

222
00:15:02,276 --> 00:15:04,194
You want to talk here? Like this?

223
00:15:27,968 --> 00:15:28,844
Hello.

224
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:33,057
Oh, my.

225
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:39,730
Who…

226
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:04,171
Now tell me.
Why did you come all the way out here?

227
00:16:04,254 --> 00:16:05,339
How have you been?

228
00:16:09,176 --> 00:16:10,010
Min.

229
00:16:10,594 --> 00:16:11,720
Didn't we break up?

230
00:16:12,721 --> 00:16:15,432
It's been a year.
Why are you here acting all friendly?

231
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:17,726
You can't just show up--

232
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:18,644
I missed you.

233
00:16:20,896 --> 00:16:22,064
A lot.

234
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:23,232
I really missed you.

235
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:25,067
That's why I came.

236
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:27,194
What do you mean?

237
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:33,117
I want us to get back together.

238
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:37,162
I will not bring back
the bad things from before.

239
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:40,207
Let's start over
with just the good things. Properly.

240
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:43,961
Hey, Ji-yul.

241
00:16:44,044 --> 00:16:44,878
Hey.

242
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:50,426
-What are you doing here?
-Yun-hyeong!

243
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:52,094
Hey, when did you get back?

244
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:53,804
About a month ago.

245
00:16:55,222 --> 00:16:57,057
And what are you doing here?

246
00:16:57,141 --> 00:16:58,225
I came to see you.

247
00:17:03,564 --> 00:17:05,983
Did you have a good time today?

248
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:08,527
Here's the preview for next week.

249
00:17:10,112 --> 00:17:12,990
The person that you were
all so curious about, Doctor Han.

250
00:17:14,658 --> 00:17:17,119
Mr. Handsome, Doctor Han.

251
00:17:18,495 --> 00:17:22,791
Doctor Han's currently working
in Cheongmyung as a vet for large animals,

252
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:27,463
and I'm going over there to learn
about large animal veterinary medicine.

253
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:30,799
I bet that he's all tanned by now,
with sexy, olive-toned--

254
00:17:31,967 --> 00:17:34,887
How was I supposed to know
that Min was a subscriber?

255
00:17:35,554 --> 00:17:37,264
This is really not my fault.

256
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:42,603
Whether she's subscribed
to your channel or not,

257
00:17:42,686 --> 00:17:46,523
you should run it by me
before saying things like that on stream.

258
00:17:46,607 --> 00:17:49,109
Do you know how rare it is
to see you surprised?

259
00:17:50,235 --> 00:17:53,614
Do you think people watch my videos
to see animals? You're the star.

260
00:17:57,951 --> 00:18:00,120
So? Does she want to get back together?

261
00:18:02,664 --> 00:18:05,209
She wouldn't have come
all the way here otherwise.

262
00:18:05,292 --> 00:18:08,045
You know how tenacious she is.
What will you do?

263
00:18:16,136 --> 00:18:19,056
Your hospital is so cute, Ji-yul.
It's so vintage.

264
00:18:20,057 --> 00:18:21,100
If you're done, just--

265
00:18:21,183 --> 00:18:24,186
And you've gotten more manly.

266
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:25,604
It's hot.

267
00:18:28,232 --> 00:18:31,985
I'll pretend I didn't hear you earlier.
Go back before it gets dark.

268
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:35,781
I'm going to stay here for a week.

269
00:18:37,282 --> 00:18:40,244
I was going to be brazen
and crash at your place,

270
00:18:40,327 --> 00:18:42,454
but I thought you might actually run away.

271
00:18:44,414 --> 00:18:47,626
I asked around at the village hall.
They'll find me a place to stay.

272
00:18:47,709 --> 00:18:50,712
-What are you even--
-I'll only be here for a week.

273
00:18:51,421 --> 00:18:53,715
I'll do my best to win you over in a week.

274
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:56,385
If that doesn't work,
I'll go back to Seoul.

275
00:18:56,468 --> 00:18:58,178
So stop telling me to go back.

276
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,639
You both know how stubborn I am, right?

277
00:19:00,722 --> 00:19:03,892
-Hey, Choi Min.
-You can put up with this much, can't you?

278
00:19:05,394 --> 00:19:08,355
It already breaks my heart
to describe it like that.

279
00:19:09,648 --> 00:19:11,150
But I'm going to get through it.

280
00:19:12,192 --> 00:19:15,529
I'm confident that I can change
the way you look at me in a week.

281
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:24,246
I said what I need to,
so I'll get out of your hair for today.

282
00:19:26,456 --> 00:19:30,335
My heart is racing.
This is a bit hard on me.

283
00:19:33,422 --> 00:19:35,757
See you tomorrow then.
You too, Yun-hyeong.

284
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:37,759
-Yes, sure.
-Where is it?

285
00:19:39,386 --> 00:19:40,888
The place you're staying.

286
00:19:52,524 --> 00:19:53,358
Yes, Auntie.

287
00:19:57,362 --> 00:19:59,698
What are you doing?
I said I was going to do it.

288
00:19:59,781 --> 00:20:00,699
-Hey.
-You came.

289
00:20:00,782 --> 00:20:02,534
-Right.
-I told you.

290
00:20:02,618 --> 00:20:04,620
-Gosh, it's hot.
-Jeez.

291
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:06,288
Oh, my goodness.

292
00:20:07,915 --> 00:20:09,333
Well, you know.

293
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:12,836
I just felt really bad
because it's all so sudden.

294
00:20:13,921 --> 00:20:16,590
I went home after we had our guest,

295
00:20:16,673 --> 00:20:19,134
and the water pipe burst all of a sudden!

296
00:20:20,636 --> 00:20:24,306
My house and yours are the only ones
with spare rooms.

297
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:27,100
So please take good care of her
for the next few days.

298
00:20:27,184 --> 00:20:29,228
You really don't have to feel bad.
It's okay.

299
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:32,522
I don't think it's going to be okay.
I think she'll be here a while.

300
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:37,194
Man, I'm all over the place.

301
00:20:37,277 --> 00:20:39,863
How does a pipe burst
in the middle of summer?

302
00:20:39,947 --> 00:20:42,366
Man-gi and I are staying
at Gyeong-ok's place.

303
00:20:42,449 --> 00:20:45,869
We're all split up right now
until the repair is done.

304
00:20:45,953 --> 00:20:47,579
By the way, who is she?

305
00:20:47,663 --> 00:20:49,539
You don't need a week
to look around this place.

306
00:20:49,623 --> 00:20:53,168
Is she even a real woman?
Not a man who sounds like one?

307
00:20:56,505 --> 00:21:00,425
Hey, do you really think
I'd let a guy into Ja-young's place?

308
00:21:01,635 --> 00:21:04,096
Although I really want to.

309
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:08,183
It's a woman. A young woman.

310
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:10,018
A young and pretty woman.

311
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:13,563
We're going to have to keep
all the village men in line,

312
00:21:13,647 --> 00:21:15,524
or there will be some domestic disputes.

313
00:21:20,195 --> 00:21:21,071
Hello.

314
00:21:21,154 --> 00:21:23,865
I got this new address through text.

315
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:25,325
Hey.

316
00:21:25,409 --> 00:21:26,368
My goodness.

317
00:21:29,496 --> 00:21:30,455
Where's your luggage?

318
00:21:35,877 --> 00:21:36,837
Hold on.

319
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:39,715
Our bed-and-breakfast guest was
our vet's guest?

320
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:42,009
Well, that's…

321
00:21:42,092 --> 00:21:44,011
You did say you had a girlfriend.

322
00:21:44,678 --> 00:21:46,471
This must be her, right?

323
00:21:49,057 --> 00:21:49,975
I see.

324
00:21:50,058 --> 00:21:53,103
But if she's your girlfriend,
why is she staying here?

325
00:21:53,186 --> 00:21:55,772
Never mind. Of course.

326
00:21:55,856 --> 00:21:58,608
You're staying at
your grandparents' house.

327
00:21:58,692 --> 00:22:02,112
To stay with your girlfriend
in that house is a little…

328
00:22:02,195 --> 00:22:03,613
Right.

329
00:22:04,906 --> 00:22:07,659
You just made a new batch
of that bush clover liquor.

330
00:22:07,743 --> 00:22:10,537
Shouldn't you give
our doctor here a bottle?

331
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:13,790
Since he's reuniting with his girlfriend
after a long while?

332
00:22:13,874 --> 00:22:18,086
Should I then? Would you like a bottle?

333
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:20,297
-No? I shouldn't?
-No.

334
00:22:24,718 --> 00:22:25,719
It's not like that.

335
00:22:25,802 --> 00:22:28,472
Whatever it is,
we'll be grateful and enjoy it.

336
00:22:29,723 --> 00:22:31,683
Oh, my word.

337
00:22:31,767 --> 00:22:34,686
What a handsome couple.

338
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:38,815
For a man who seems as stiff as a board,
you sure found a nice girlfriend.

339
00:22:39,941 --> 00:22:43,528
You must be exhausted from your trip.
You should go unpack and rest.

340
00:22:43,612 --> 00:22:45,781
You were supposed to stay at my place,

341
00:22:45,864 --> 00:22:48,075
but like I explained earlier,

342
00:22:48,158 --> 00:22:49,993
something came up.

343
00:22:50,077 --> 00:22:54,498
This is a regular residential home,
so it might be a little inconvenient.

344
00:22:54,581 --> 00:22:57,918
But let's try to be understanding

345
00:22:58,001 --> 00:22:59,836
and get along well, okay?

346
00:23:00,462 --> 00:23:02,047
I'm not picky about where I sleep.

347
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:04,424
Is that so?

348
00:23:05,884 --> 00:23:08,762
I'm sorry to cause you trouble
with my sudden visit.

349
00:23:10,347 --> 00:23:11,556
Thank you for your hospitality.

350
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,266
Sure.

351
00:23:17,145 --> 00:23:19,439
She's so nice and polite

352
00:23:19,523 --> 00:23:21,525
unlike other young people these days.

353
00:23:23,693 --> 00:23:25,195
So nice.

354
00:23:27,781 --> 00:23:31,159
Aren't you the police officer
Ji-yul was with earlier?

355
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,036
Yes.

356
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:36,623
That's our Officer Ahn.
You've already met each other.

357
00:23:37,374 --> 00:23:39,251
-How do you know Ji-yul?
-Ja-young.

358
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:46,800
I brought…

359
00:23:46,883 --> 00:23:51,471
Oh, my. Just when Ja-young was about to
feel lonely among the lovers.

360
00:23:51,555 --> 00:23:54,516
You came at the right time.

361
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:55,934
He's our Ja-young's

362
00:23:56,518 --> 00:23:57,394
soulmate.

363
00:24:02,774 --> 00:24:05,360
-So he's your boyfriend.
-What?

364
00:24:08,446 --> 00:24:09,364
No.

365
00:24:09,447 --> 00:24:12,075
I'm Choi Min. I'll be staying
at your girlfriend's for a week.

366
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,953
I'll do my best to not disturb you.

367
00:24:16,496 --> 00:24:17,664
Right.

368
00:24:19,708 --> 00:24:21,042
Sure.

369
00:24:25,213 --> 00:24:27,632
Oh, my gosh. Who's disturbing who?

370
00:24:27,716 --> 00:24:29,259
It's hard to tell.

371
00:24:29,342 --> 00:24:30,635
Maybe we are.

372
00:24:33,471 --> 00:24:34,306
How nice.

373
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:37,184
Hey, is it all ripe? The peppers?

374
00:24:54,576 --> 00:24:56,244
It's so nice and clean.

375
00:24:56,828 --> 00:24:59,623
Well, it's just a simple home.

376
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:03,877
It's a picture from your childhood.

377
00:25:04,669 --> 00:25:06,713
You were pretty even back then.

378
00:25:14,512 --> 00:25:15,513
This way, please.

379
00:25:15,597 --> 00:25:16,431
Okay.

380
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:21,686
By the way,
aren't you scared to be living alone?

381
00:25:22,771 --> 00:25:26,066
I've been living here since birth,
so not really.

382
00:25:26,149 --> 00:25:28,193
It's a real pain to clean though.

383
00:25:32,614 --> 00:25:33,657
It's this room.

384
00:25:35,408 --> 00:25:37,369
It's so much nicer than I imagined.

385
00:25:38,078 --> 00:25:39,454
I'll keep it clean.

386
00:25:56,137 --> 00:25:58,515
Your girlfriend must have missed you a lot

387
00:25:58,598 --> 00:25:59,808
to come all the way here.

388
00:26:01,476 --> 00:26:03,019
She's not my girlfriend.

389
00:26:03,979 --> 00:26:04,896
She's not?

390
00:26:07,482 --> 00:26:08,692
Do you even have one?

391
00:26:09,442 --> 00:26:10,443
I do not.

392
00:26:15,907 --> 00:26:19,077
And you don't have one either.

393
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:25,625
I think you're wrong.

394
00:26:31,548 --> 00:26:32,966
You are still here.

395
00:26:35,802 --> 00:26:36,970
Should I go get her?

396
00:26:37,053 --> 00:26:37,887
She's unpacking.

397
00:26:39,347 --> 00:26:41,016
No, that's okay.

398
00:26:46,021 --> 00:26:48,440
You need your bicycle back, right?

399
00:26:48,523 --> 00:26:49,983
Thank you for letting me use it.

400
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:51,651
You know, I…

401
00:26:57,449 --> 00:26:59,659
-Let's take Nurungji for a walk.
-What?

402
00:26:59,743 --> 00:27:01,328
And I need to talk to you.

403
00:27:02,746 --> 00:27:03,621
Sure.

404
00:27:22,265 --> 00:27:23,808
This is good.

405
00:27:25,685 --> 00:27:27,020
Let's take one together.

406
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:33,360
What is this?

407
00:27:33,443 --> 00:27:35,487
Wait. You want me to sleep there?

408
00:27:36,946 --> 00:27:39,491
Come on.
How long are you going to stay mad?

409
00:27:40,533 --> 00:27:42,994
I know you don't like things
happening unexpectedly,

410
00:27:43,078 --> 00:27:46,581
but honestly, it's not my fault.
She decided to come here on her own.

411
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:49,751
So what will you do?

412
00:27:50,377 --> 00:27:52,379
I don't think she's being spontaneous.

413
00:27:54,297 --> 00:27:55,215
In my opinion,

414
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,634
there is room for reconsideration.

415
00:27:57,717 --> 00:27:59,928
The breakup was quite hard on you.

416
00:28:00,553 --> 00:28:02,639
And it's not like you're seeing anyone.

417
00:28:03,348 --> 00:28:05,767
Besides, she is your first love.

418
00:28:07,769 --> 00:28:10,105
Stop being mad and have a seat.

419
00:28:12,941 --> 00:28:15,944
It's not like your relationship
crashed and burned.

420
00:28:16,027 --> 00:28:18,696
It was because Min had to go
to the States for work.

421
00:28:19,697 --> 00:28:22,492
If I were you,
I'd take her back in an instant.

422
00:28:22,575 --> 00:28:24,953
She's pretty, nice, and smart.

423
00:28:25,036 --> 00:28:26,913
If someone like that wanted me back,

424
00:28:27,622 --> 00:28:30,875
I would just give her a bone-crushing hug…

425
00:28:35,046 --> 00:28:38,341
I'm not saying I want to hug her.
I was just making a point.

426
00:28:39,134 --> 00:28:41,845
See? You're offended
by something like this.

427
00:28:41,928 --> 00:28:43,930
You must still have feelings for her.

428
00:28:45,056 --> 00:28:48,935
Please don't imagine anything
that involves anyone around me.

429
00:28:49,018 --> 00:28:50,687
Including Min.

430
00:28:50,770 --> 00:28:54,733
You should see the look of disdain
on your face.

431
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:58,862
To think that I treated you
like my own brother all those years…

432
00:28:58,945 --> 00:29:00,113
My goodness.

433
00:29:00,697 --> 00:29:02,699
I mean, I have such a big heart.

434
00:29:02,782 --> 00:29:06,244
Why isn't there a woman out there
who wants to be crushed by my hug?

435
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:12,792
By the way,
how old is that nurse from earlier?

436
00:29:14,961 --> 00:29:16,838
Fine, I'll stop. Just sit down.

437
00:29:16,921 --> 00:29:18,214
I'll just sleep there.

438
00:29:18,298 --> 00:29:20,759
A man can ask. Seriously.

439
00:29:24,053 --> 00:29:26,973
So who is that Officer Ahn?

440
00:29:27,056 --> 00:29:28,099
I'm dying to see her.

441
00:29:33,813 --> 00:29:34,731
Yun-hyeong.

442
00:29:36,691 --> 00:29:38,568
If you were me,

443
00:29:40,028 --> 00:29:41,571
what would be on your mind now?

444
00:29:42,238 --> 00:29:43,072
I don't know.

445
00:29:43,573 --> 00:29:45,575
I guess I'd be thinking about
Min the most.

446
00:29:45,658 --> 00:29:47,285
Like, "What should I do with her?"

447
00:29:47,869 --> 00:29:48,828
Right?

448
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:51,748
That would be the norm, right?

449
00:29:58,254 --> 00:29:59,881
She's an amazing young lady.

450
00:30:00,882 --> 00:30:02,300
Your bed-and-breakfast guest.

451
00:30:03,593 --> 00:30:04,469
Yes.

452
00:30:05,094 --> 00:30:06,638
She's assertive,

453
00:30:07,472 --> 00:30:08,765
brave,

454
00:30:09,390 --> 00:30:10,433
and pretty.

455
00:30:12,185 --> 00:30:13,311
Are you talking about yourself?

456
00:30:14,938 --> 00:30:16,773
What? Are you crazy?

457
00:30:18,983 --> 00:30:20,276
I am crazy.

458
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:21,486
You could say that.

459
00:30:24,405 --> 00:30:25,240
Sang-hyeon.

460
00:30:33,456 --> 00:30:34,958
Did you think it through?

461
00:30:41,130 --> 00:30:42,173
Nurungji!

462
00:30:49,931 --> 00:30:50,932
Hey.

463
00:30:59,691 --> 00:31:01,317
What are you doing here?

464
00:31:05,822 --> 00:31:08,199
She's not my girlfriend.

465
00:31:09,367 --> 00:31:10,493
What?

466
00:31:10,577 --> 00:31:13,580
I don't have a girlfriend.

467
00:31:42,859 --> 00:31:45,862
I ruined the relationship,
so I can't rekindle it on my own.

468
00:31:45,945 --> 00:31:47,530
You'll help me, right?

469
00:31:47,614 --> 00:31:49,908
You two work in the same field.

470
00:31:49,991 --> 00:31:51,659
You are going to go back to Seoul, right?

471
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:53,786
You could see each other often.

472
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:55,788
He's so talented.

473
00:31:55,872 --> 00:31:57,290
He must have been very popular.

474
00:31:57,373 --> 00:31:59,459
You're right, he was my first crush.

475
00:31:59,542 --> 00:32:02,045
Do you want to date someone
that you know well?

476
00:32:02,128 --> 00:32:05,089
Being comfortable is a critical component
of a good relationship.

477
00:32:05,173 --> 00:32:08,217
The doctor's always looking at Ja-young.

478
00:32:08,301 --> 00:32:12,472
The way I see it, he definitely likes her.

479
00:32:12,555 --> 00:32:16,392
