1
00:00:48,757 --> 00:00:50,383
Oh, my goodness!

2
00:00:50,967 --> 00:00:53,803
What is this?
What are you doing hiding there?

3
00:01:00,101 --> 00:01:03,146
Why are you being so sneaky?

4
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:09,152
I've never seen this car around.

5
00:01:09,235 --> 00:01:13,615
What on earth are you
doing here at this hour?

6
00:01:13,698 --> 00:01:15,700
Get out of the car. Who are you?

7
00:01:15,784 --> 00:01:16,951
Who is that?

8
00:01:17,035 --> 00:01:18,495
I've never seen this car before.

9
00:01:18,578 --> 00:01:20,163
Come on out. Who are you?

10
00:01:22,582 --> 00:01:23,750
Who are you?

11
00:01:23,833 --> 00:01:25,168
Yes, hello.

12
00:01:25,251 --> 00:01:28,004
Come on out just for a moment.
Who are you?

13
00:01:38,097 --> 00:01:40,350
Oh, my gosh! You scared me to death!

14
00:01:40,433 --> 00:01:43,144
My goodness, my heart. What on earth?

15
00:01:43,228 --> 00:01:44,312
Doctor, it's you.

16
00:01:44,395 --> 00:01:46,481
-And Ja-young?
-Hey, Auntie.

17
00:01:47,232 --> 00:01:49,400
-What the heck is going on?
-Yes, I…

18
00:01:50,276 --> 00:01:51,361
Are you dating him, Yeong-suk?

19
00:01:54,197 --> 00:01:57,075
Yes, we are dating.

20
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:01,746
-Now you know.
-We…

21
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:05,625
We accidentally ran into
each other after work.

22
00:02:05,708 --> 00:02:06,751
-Right.
-Are you on your way

23
00:02:06,835 --> 00:02:08,002
to pick up Cheol-yong?

24
00:02:08,086 --> 00:02:09,337
Yes, that's right.

25
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:11,131
But never mind that.

26
00:02:11,214 --> 00:02:14,050
This is a much more important matter now.

27
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:16,594
So who are you?
You don't look like a local.

28
00:02:16,678 --> 00:02:17,804
No, I'm not.

29
00:02:17,887 --> 00:02:19,264
Hello, I'm…

30
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:23,101
Well, he's…

31
00:02:24,018 --> 00:02:26,688
He's a close friend of mine.
We work together in Seoul.

32
00:02:27,188 --> 00:02:28,231
Yes, hello.

33
00:02:28,731 --> 00:02:29,899
He's from Seoul?

34
00:02:31,109 --> 00:02:32,068
Yeong-suk.

35
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:33,820
Yeong-suk, you…

36
00:02:33,903 --> 00:02:36,239
-You're dating a man from Seoul.
-Auntie.

37
00:02:36,322 --> 00:02:38,449
-A man from Seoul…
-I'll talk to Yeong-suk.

38
00:02:38,533 --> 00:02:40,326
-So let's go get Cheol-yong.
-Seoul?

39
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:43,746
Okay. Nice to meet you. You're handsome.

40
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:44,789
And you have a nice car.

41
00:02:44,873 --> 00:02:45,707
Yeong-suk.

42
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:48,293
-Yeong-suk, you're dating a man from…
-Let's go already!

43
00:03:03,933 --> 00:03:04,767
Yun-hyeong?

44
00:03:05,727 --> 00:03:07,228
-Yun-hyeong.
-Yes?

45
00:03:08,271 --> 00:03:09,522
Oh, right.

46
00:03:11,941 --> 00:03:13,067
Yeong-suk.

47
00:03:18,197 --> 00:03:19,490
How did this happen?

48
00:03:19,574 --> 00:03:20,575
So?

49
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:22,619
When did you start dating?

50
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:25,997
I missed her so much,
so I came to see her for a little bit.

51
00:03:26,623 --> 00:03:30,460
I've finished all my work for the day,
so don't nag me about it, okay?

52
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:37,175
Anyhow,

53
00:03:37,258 --> 00:03:38,927
you've succeeded, haven't you?

54
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:41,387
That's Officer Ahn, right?

55
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:42,722
I told you.

56
00:03:42,805 --> 00:03:46,643
You start acting on my advice
and love begins just like that.

57
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:47,936
-Good boy.
-Hey.

58
00:03:48,019 --> 00:03:49,437
Well done.

59
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:53,900
Yun-hyeong,
if you're not serious about her,

60
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:56,527
I'm against this.

61
00:03:56,611 --> 00:03:58,529
Assistant Lee is such a nice person.

62
00:04:00,531 --> 00:04:03,117
Would you drive hours
to see someone you're not serious about?

63
00:04:05,286 --> 00:04:06,871
I'm serious too, you little punk.

64
00:04:07,622 --> 00:04:09,999
You think you're the only one
in a serious relationship?

65
00:04:13,795 --> 00:04:14,796
So?

66
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:16,839
How do you think this is going to end?

67
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:19,008
How do you think it's going to end?

68
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:24,764
I want to see her for a very long time.

69
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:29,519
But we just started dating,
so I'll have to hear what she thinks.

70
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:34,274
I don't know, man.
How can I think of that by myself?

71
00:04:34,357 --> 00:04:36,943
It takes two people
to figure out a relationship.

72
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:43,700
People talk about love at first sight.
About how you just know they're the one.

73
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:48,997
But I had no idea
that I'd experience it myself.

74
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:52,667
Isn't she just so pretty?

75
00:04:53,543 --> 00:04:54,877
I've been going crazy these days.

76
00:04:55,712 --> 00:04:56,754
Seriously.

77
00:04:57,797 --> 00:04:58,840
I'm so happy.

78
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:09,267
Want to go to the movies on your day off?
Like a normal date.

79
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:18,067
I'd love to! What movie should we watch?

80
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:21,779
I looked it up

81
00:05:21,863 --> 00:05:24,157
and the nearest movie theater
is a bit far away.

82
00:05:27,785 --> 00:05:30,621
Yes, that's still
the closest one around here.

83
00:05:31,122 --> 00:05:34,083
Since everyone works in the morning,
let's go to an early movie.

84
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:35,918
I think that would be the safest.

85
00:05:37,795 --> 00:05:40,214
Then I'll book the earliest showtime.

86
00:05:49,432 --> 00:05:50,433
Yes, Ms. Lee.

87
00:05:52,935 --> 00:05:53,811
What?

88
00:05:56,898 --> 00:05:59,358
But I thought there was nothing
scheduled for this morning.

89
00:05:59,442 --> 00:06:02,487
Yes, but I just got an urgent call.

90
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:04,197
There are signs of premature labor.

91
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:07,283
They said that the mother's water broke
and she was bleeding too,

92
00:06:07,366 --> 00:06:09,077
so I said I'd give you a call.

93
00:06:12,121 --> 00:06:14,791
Good morning, Nurungji.

94
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:18,377
I'll be back, my baby.
Oh, my gosh. I'll see you later.

95
00:06:21,255 --> 00:06:22,298
Yes, Chief.

96
00:06:22,381 --> 00:06:24,884
Hey. We need you to come in.

97
00:06:24,967 --> 00:06:27,553
What's going on?

98
00:06:27,637 --> 00:06:30,056
You know the old lady with Alzheimer's
at the chicken farm?

99
00:06:30,139 --> 00:06:31,849
She's gone missing again.

100
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:34,143
You've tracked her down
a few times before.

101
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:38,106
Her son wants you to help look for her
since you're the only one she recognizes.

102
00:06:38,689 --> 00:06:40,399
Okay, I'll be right there.

103
00:06:41,275 --> 00:06:42,151
Okay.

104
00:06:47,532 --> 00:06:49,367
Should we just catch a late-night movie?

105
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:53,037
-Sounds good.
-I heard she disappeared again.

106
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:54,622
I'll go that way.

107
00:06:54,705 --> 00:06:55,623
Okay.

108
00:06:57,333 --> 00:07:00,294
It takes a little over an hour
to get to the theater,

109
00:07:00,378 --> 00:07:01,629
so let's meet around nine.

110
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:05,383
Have you seen Ms. Gil?

111
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:13,391
Excuse me, have you seen Ms. Gil?

112
00:07:13,975 --> 00:07:16,060
It's been having diarrhea since yesterday.

113
00:07:16,144 --> 00:07:17,603
You fed it corn, didn't you?

114
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:20,064
I'll administer antibiotics
one last time, but…

115
00:07:20,148 --> 00:07:20,982
Ms. Gil!

116
00:07:24,193 --> 00:07:25,194
Darn it!

117
00:07:31,409 --> 00:07:32,702
Yes, Ms. Lee.

118
00:07:32,785 --> 00:07:33,744
Ms. Gil…

119
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:40,126
Ms. Gil!

120
00:07:40,209 --> 00:07:43,463
Try to keep the floor a little cleaner.

121
00:07:46,174 --> 00:07:47,633
Ms. Gil, where are you?

122
00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:49,719
Ms. Gil!

123
00:07:49,802 --> 00:07:50,845
Ms. Gil!

124
00:07:55,057 --> 00:07:55,975
Ms. Gil!

125
00:07:56,058 --> 00:07:58,227
SANDEUL POLICE STATION

126
00:08:02,106 --> 00:08:03,983
-Is he on his way?
-Yes.

127
00:08:04,066 --> 00:08:07,195
Mom, let's go already. I'm tired.
Hurry up and get in.

128
00:08:07,278 --> 00:08:08,112
Hurry.

129
00:08:08,196 --> 00:08:09,322
-Good night.
-Get in.

130
00:08:09,405 --> 00:08:11,157
Thank you as always, Officer Ahn.

131
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,742
-Thank you.
-Okay, take care.

132
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:15,161
-Let's hang out another time, Ms. Gil.
-Jeez, Mom. Get in.

133
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:19,832
My goodness.

134
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,084
Good work, both of you.

135
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:25,004
Especially you.
Thank you for doing this on your day off.

136
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:26,631
-I'm proud of you.
-Then I'll…

137
00:08:26,714 --> 00:08:27,965
Will you buy us dinner then?

138
00:08:28,049 --> 00:08:29,967
Okay. Let's have a team dinner.

139
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:32,220
-All right, my treat. Let's go.
-Wait, I…

140
00:08:32,303 --> 00:08:33,888
-The thing is…
-Do you have plans?

141
00:08:36,474 --> 00:08:37,892
Stay just for a while.

142
00:08:37,975 --> 00:08:39,769
-I'll let you go soon!
-No, I really--

143
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:42,104
We'll just grab a bite.
I'm just so proud of you.

144
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:47,235
-Let's go.
-What should we eat?

145
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:55,576
We can go see a movie another time,
so just enjoy your dinner.

146
00:08:56,661 --> 00:08:57,662
They have good meat here.

147
00:08:57,745 --> 00:09:00,831
No way. We've already put it off once.

148
00:09:03,584 --> 00:09:05,253
Watch where you're going, dude.

149
00:09:05,336 --> 00:09:06,504
Oh, my goodness.

150
00:09:06,587 --> 00:09:07,672
It's fine.

151
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:09,966
-I'll be there no matter what.
-I'm fine.

152
00:09:10,466 --> 00:09:12,093
I'm leaving right after dinner.

153
00:09:13,094 --> 00:09:15,388
I'll see you outside
the community center at nine.

154
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:21,185
I guess I'll go home, shower,
and then head over there.

155
00:09:21,894 --> 00:09:23,896
Is it good? Hey, let's dig in.

156
00:09:26,482 --> 00:09:28,067
There, I had a bite.

157
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:30,152
Wait, literally one bite? Hey!

158
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:31,070
-Hey!
-You're really leaving?

159
00:09:31,153 --> 00:09:32,446
Hey!

160
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:33,406
Get over here.

161
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:35,700
-What the hell do you want?
-Come here!

162
00:09:35,783 --> 00:09:38,077
-Darn it.
-Hey, stop that!

163
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:41,080
-Break it up!
-You want a piece of this?

164
00:09:41,163 --> 00:09:43,457
-Hey!
-Stop it!

165
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:45,626
-You're going to hurt yourself!
-Let go of me!

166
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:48,629
Why can't they just have
a nice drink together?

167
00:09:49,964 --> 00:09:52,967
I guess you're closed for tonight.
My goodness.

168
00:09:55,803 --> 00:09:56,929
I'm really okay.

169
00:09:57,513 --> 00:09:58,848
Let's go to the movies another time.

170
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:00,182
Call me when you're done.

171
00:10:06,063 --> 00:10:09,233
Jeez, these people.

172
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:12,695
My goodness.

173
00:10:23,497 --> 00:10:24,498
Hey, Officer Ahn.

174
00:10:25,082 --> 00:10:26,375
-You…
-I sent them away.

175
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:27,585
Okay, well done.

176
00:10:29,378 --> 00:10:32,173
Hey, what's wrong with you?

177
00:10:41,098 --> 00:10:42,058
OFFICER AHN

178
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:43,643
You wait right there.

179
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:57,823
I'm on my way.

180
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:02,787
Should I call her?

181
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:10,419
-This is nice, even in the summer.
-It is.

182
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:11,879
Isn't that Doctor Han?

183
00:11:12,463 --> 00:11:13,631
Doctor Han?

184
00:11:14,298 --> 00:11:16,050
It is you. Hey.

185
00:11:16,133 --> 00:11:18,135
-Hello.
-Hi, what are you doing here?

186
00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:19,720
-Pardon?
-What are you doing here?

187
00:11:20,471 --> 00:11:22,932
The weather was nice, so…

188
00:11:23,891 --> 00:11:25,726
-I was taking a stroll.
-A stroll?

189
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:27,311
But it's so dark out.

190
00:11:27,395 --> 00:11:28,521
You're a walking mosquito feast.

191
00:11:30,147 --> 00:11:33,109
Someone once had the same idea
and died falling into a rice paddy.

192
00:11:35,861 --> 00:11:37,321
Hey.

193
00:11:37,405 --> 00:11:38,447
Isn't that Ja-young?

194
00:11:38,989 --> 00:11:40,324
It is.

195
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:41,409
Or is it?

196
00:11:43,327 --> 00:11:45,162
-Ja-young.
-Officer Ahn.

197
00:11:45,788 --> 00:11:47,248
What's wrong, Ja-young?

198
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:50,167
Officer Ahn.

199
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:53,629
-What's going on?
-Did she look drunk to you?

200
00:11:53,712 --> 00:11:55,589
Right? She must have
had something to celebrate.

201
00:11:56,257 --> 00:11:58,884
I wonder why she drank so much.
Maybe she was in a good mood?

202
00:12:07,184 --> 00:12:12,356
My most beloved Huidong residents!

203
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:15,401
I, Ahn Ja-young,

204
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:19,405
am in a relationship
for the first time in my life!

205
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:23,492
I'm dating Han Ji-yul,

206
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:27,204
the grandson of the
Han Deok-jin Veterinary Hospital director!

207
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:36,130
Wait a minute.
You said we'd keep it a secret.

208
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:38,215
Who's this?

209
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:42,470
It's the face
I've been dying to see all day.

210
00:12:48,809 --> 00:12:50,311
Okay, everyone.

211
00:12:50,394 --> 00:12:53,147
Right now, I'm standing
next to Mr. Han Ji-yul,

212
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:56,775
the man who's dating me,
Huidong police officer Ahn Ja-young.

213
00:12:57,359 --> 00:13:00,279
Is it true that you're dating
Ms. Ahn Ja-young?

214
00:13:02,031 --> 00:13:02,990
Is it true?

215
00:13:06,076 --> 00:13:07,161
Yes, it's true.

216
00:13:16,545 --> 00:13:18,297
What I wanted to say was,

217
00:13:19,757 --> 00:13:22,301
we'd like to openly go out to the movies,

218
00:13:22,384 --> 00:13:25,054
openly go out to eat,

219
00:13:25,137 --> 00:13:28,057
and see each other without making excuses.

220
00:13:29,892 --> 00:13:31,310
What I'm getting at is,

221
00:13:31,393 --> 00:13:34,313
Ahn Ja-young will be
busy dating from now on,

222
00:13:34,897 --> 00:13:37,691
so please be understanding.

223
00:13:38,901 --> 00:13:39,777
Okay?

224
00:13:41,153 --> 00:13:43,822
Everyone, be happy!

225
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:05,010
You didn't have to make
a whole announcement about that.

226
00:14:05,094 --> 00:14:06,512
Everyone already knows.

227
00:14:06,595 --> 00:14:08,889
Did you really think we didn't know?

228
00:14:08,973 --> 00:14:11,308
I'm sure they're
blinded by love right now.

229
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:13,727
The whole village knows.

230
00:14:13,811 --> 00:14:15,312
You big dummies.

231
00:14:15,896 --> 00:14:17,982
Jeez, look at those fools.

232
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:22,152
Our acting must have been pretty good.

233
00:14:22,236 --> 00:14:24,738
We pretended not to know,
and they bought it.

234
00:14:24,822 --> 00:14:28,409
Oh, my goodness.
Village residents, look over here.

235
00:14:29,034 --> 00:14:31,704
-Did you really think that we didn't know?
-Hey, Ja-young.

236
00:14:40,504 --> 00:14:43,007
Are you sure you're okay?

237
00:14:45,467 --> 00:14:46,468
I'm fine.

238
00:14:47,094 --> 00:14:49,221
I was a tad bit tipsy,

239
00:14:49,805 --> 00:14:51,348
but now I'm completely sober.

240
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:55,853
We were supposed to
see our first movie together.

241
00:14:55,936 --> 00:14:58,939
But things kept going sideways,
so I had a few drinks out of anger.

242
00:15:02,526 --> 00:15:03,986
I…

243
00:15:04,695 --> 00:15:07,364
I never imagined that you would be the one

244
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:09,658
to tell everyone about us.

245
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:13,412
But they said they already knew.

246
00:15:13,495 --> 00:15:15,122
How did they know?

247
00:15:15,205 --> 00:15:18,667
Maybe we should have just been
open about it from the get-go.

248
00:15:19,376 --> 00:15:21,921
Soon, we won't even be able to
see each other that often.

249
00:15:22,004 --> 00:15:23,297
We wasted time hiding it.

250
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:24,590
What a waste of time.

251
00:15:30,095 --> 00:15:31,680
Now that we're not hiding it,

252
00:15:32,681 --> 00:15:34,808
-let's do that thing.
-What…

253
00:15:34,892 --> 00:15:36,852
What? What do you…

254
00:15:38,687 --> 00:15:42,149
This is what you wanted to do
now that everyone knows?

255
00:15:42,983 --> 00:15:45,694
I really wanted to do this again.

256
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:48,155
But it would be really noticeable,

257
00:15:48,238 --> 00:15:49,198
so I didn't dare.

258
00:15:52,117 --> 00:15:52,952
What?

259
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:55,245
-Me?
-Yes.

260
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:08,133
How do you look
exactly the same as 15 years ago?

261
00:16:11,595 --> 00:16:12,846
Just on your ring finger, okay?

262
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:15,307
Be honest with me.

263
00:16:15,391 --> 00:16:17,017
You never intended to
keep it a secret, did you?

264
00:16:19,269 --> 00:16:20,396
Maybe.

265
00:16:22,189 --> 00:16:24,024
It's not easy to approach a man

266
00:16:24,108 --> 00:16:26,527
whose fingernail is
dyed with balsam flowers.

267
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:29,571
You're a lot more possessive
than I thought, Officer Ahn.

268
00:16:30,447 --> 00:16:31,490
Of course.

269
00:16:31,573 --> 00:16:34,159
I have to leave a mark
that shows you're mine

270
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:36,286
so that no one will try to steal you.

271
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:38,163
And this doesn't come off easily either.

272
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:39,748
Don't you dare betray me.

273
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:42,876
I'll chase you down
and turn your life into a thriller movie.

274
00:16:49,091 --> 00:16:50,467
It's all done.

275
00:16:50,551 --> 00:16:53,595
This has to stay on your finger
until tomorrow morning,

276
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:54,930
so be careful in your sleep.

277
00:16:56,056 --> 00:16:58,308
Hey, let me do yours. Have a seat.

278
00:17:01,395 --> 00:17:02,479
All right.

279
00:17:07,943 --> 00:17:12,531
I handed you a puppy and left
after we did this 15 years ago.

280
00:17:12,614 --> 00:17:14,241
But it'll be different this time.

281
00:17:15,659 --> 00:17:16,660
Listen.

282
00:17:17,911 --> 00:17:20,914
We'll be dyeing our fingernails
right here next summer,

283
00:17:21,665 --> 00:17:25,544
we'll be taking Nurungji for walks
for a long time,

284
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:28,922
and we'll be listening to
the village elders nagging.

285
00:17:29,465 --> 00:17:30,716
Together and always.

286
00:17:34,595 --> 00:17:35,471
All done.

287
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:37,282
There.

288
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:41,328
You must be sad
about summer break being over.

289
00:18:41,411 --> 00:18:44,915
Not at all.
I get to see Hui-won every day.

290
00:18:44,998 --> 00:18:46,834
-I envy you.
-Hey.

291
00:18:46,917 --> 00:18:48,961
You could talk to Doctor Han
over video calls.

292
00:18:49,044 --> 00:18:50,212
Then you could see him every day.

293
00:18:51,255 --> 00:18:52,172
Video calls?

294
00:18:53,006 --> 00:18:56,927
Wouldn't it be rude to make a video call
without any prior notice?

295
00:18:57,010 --> 00:18:59,054
-What's so rude about it?
-I mean…

296
00:19:02,182 --> 00:19:04,184
Never mind. Hurry up and get to class.

297
00:19:04,268 --> 00:19:05,102
Okay.

298
00:19:05,185 --> 00:19:06,645
Thank you for the ride.

299
00:19:16,446 --> 00:19:17,322
Yeong-suk!

300
00:19:18,282 --> 00:19:19,158
Hey.

301
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:22,161
Hey, I'll call you again later.

302
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:24,371
Don't skip your meals.

303
00:19:24,955 --> 00:19:25,789
Okay.

304
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:30,586
Thank goodness
phones are so good these days.

305
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:32,421
We're always on the phone for so long.

306
00:19:32,504 --> 00:19:35,257
My face is burning up when we hang up.
Are you guys like this too?

307
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:37,301
I guess.

308
00:19:37,384 --> 00:19:40,262
What's with that lukewarm response?

309
00:19:50,063 --> 00:19:51,732
What do you think? Do I look pretty?

310
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:57,070
Has it been two weeks since he went back?

311
00:19:57,154 --> 00:19:59,448
According to Yun-hyeong,
you guys are doing fine.

312
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:00,699
Don't you talk often?

313
00:20:01,283 --> 00:20:02,910
I mean, we do.

314
00:20:03,452 --> 00:20:06,663
Just not so often
that my phone is drenched in sweat.

315
00:20:07,247 --> 00:20:09,917
And we promised each other
to keep ourselves busy.

316
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:13,170
Every small detail of the day
must be shared

317
00:20:13,253 --> 00:20:15,297
for you to be less lonely
and less worried.

318
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:20,177
Once you start leaving out details
trying to be considerate,

319
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:23,013
that's when misunderstandings lead
to an all-out war.

320
00:20:23,096 --> 00:20:26,308
Mark my words.
I'm telling you out of experience.

321
00:20:49,456 --> 00:20:50,916
NURUNGJI

322
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:55,087
Hey!

323
00:20:56,129 --> 00:20:57,005
Oh, excuse me.

324
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:58,757
What happened to your arm?

325
00:21:00,384 --> 00:21:01,385
Well, I…

326
00:21:02,844 --> 00:21:04,429
I fell down the stairs.

327
00:21:04,513 --> 00:21:07,266
When? Why didn't you tell me?

328
00:21:07,349 --> 00:21:09,559
The other day,
when I was getting off work.

329
00:21:09,643 --> 00:21:12,354
It's just a hairline fracture,
and I'll take it off soon.

330
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:15,065
I didn't want you to be worried
for no reason.

331
00:21:15,148 --> 00:21:16,817
Still, you should have told me.

332
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:19,361
Whether it's a fracture or a bruise,

333
00:21:19,444 --> 00:21:22,322
if you hurt yourself,
you should have texted me or called me.

334
00:21:22,906 --> 00:21:26,243
I would have had no idea
until you were all healed.

335
00:21:26,326 --> 00:21:29,454
I'd just be asking,
"Have you eaten? Is everything okay?"

336
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:30,706
Why would you

337
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:33,041
keep me from knowing
that my own boyfriend got hurt?

338
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:36,753
Why won't you give me a chance
to worry about you and comfort you?

339
00:21:38,171 --> 00:21:39,172
I…

340
00:21:45,846 --> 00:21:47,097
Jeez.

341
00:21:48,765 --> 00:21:49,599
Ji-yul.

342
00:21:49,683 --> 00:21:51,059
Being considerate

343
00:21:51,601 --> 00:21:54,521
isn't always a good thing
in a human relationship.

344
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:57,357
"She must be busy working right now."

345
00:21:57,441 --> 00:22:00,610
"She must be busy eating right now.
She must have gone to bed by now."

346
00:22:00,694 --> 00:22:03,780
If you keep thinking like that,
you'll start talking to her less and less

347
00:22:03,864 --> 00:22:05,699
until things go south.

348
00:22:07,409 --> 00:22:08,368
Listen.

349
00:22:08,452 --> 00:22:10,996
What's the point of dating
if you don't bother each other?

350
00:22:11,079 --> 00:22:14,207
Bugging each other,
making each other worry a little…

351
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:16,001
That's what dating is all about.

352
00:22:19,504 --> 00:22:20,505
What is it this time?

353
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:24,259
I'm really not insecure or anything, okay?

354
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:27,471
We talk often,
and it's always nice when we do.

355
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:30,182
But we don't see each other often.

356
00:22:30,265 --> 00:22:33,727
It makes me yearn for him
and miss him more…

357
00:22:36,438 --> 00:22:38,356
I miss him even more
now that I'm talking about him.

358
00:22:42,486 --> 00:22:44,362
I'm worried that he'd get annoyed
if I call too often.

359
00:22:44,446 --> 00:22:46,364
That he'd end up not liking me anymore.

360
00:22:46,448 --> 00:22:49,242
I only call him once
every ten times I want to.

361
00:22:49,326 --> 00:22:50,911
So why did I blow up at him?

362
00:22:51,495 --> 00:22:53,705
It's not like I don't know how he feels.

363
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:03,757
I'm sorry. I should have told you.

364
00:23:04,257 --> 00:23:06,134
Let's talk this out later.

365
00:23:09,638 --> 00:23:11,431
You said it's all because you miss him.

366
00:23:12,057 --> 00:23:14,935
Just go see him.
Why are you torturing yourself?

367
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:18,396
I'll lend you my truck. Go see him today.

368
00:23:20,273 --> 00:23:22,150
What am I, a car dealer?

369
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:24,778
Jeez, what am I going to do with you two?

370
00:24:12,409 --> 00:24:13,535
BOKSIL

371
00:24:17,205 --> 00:24:18,748
I was about to call you--

372
00:24:18,832 --> 00:24:20,208
Are you in Huidong right now?

373
00:24:21,543 --> 00:24:22,377
Yes.

374
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:24,671
But I'm in Seoul right now.

375
00:24:25,213 --> 00:24:27,507
-I just found out you went there.
-What?

376
00:24:27,591 --> 00:24:29,426
Jeez, you just hurt your arm.

377
00:24:29,509 --> 00:24:31,970
Don't go anywhere.
Just stay at the hospital.

378
00:24:32,053 --> 00:24:33,805
-I'll head over right now.
-What?

379
00:24:41,855 --> 00:24:42,856
I'm sorry.

380
00:24:42,939 --> 00:24:44,900
I'd really like to keep you company,

381
00:24:44,983 --> 00:24:47,736
but I'm supposed
to go see Yeong-suk tonight.

382
00:24:48,445 --> 00:24:51,281
You really don't have to.
I'll be fine on my own.

383
00:24:51,364 --> 00:24:53,241
I'll be going then.

384
00:24:53,325 --> 00:24:54,159
-Okay.
-Bye.

385
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:56,077
Wait, one more thing.

386
00:24:57,370 --> 00:24:59,289
I'm sure you know,

387
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:01,708
but when Ji-yul
sets his mind to something,

388
00:25:01,791 --> 00:25:04,377
whatever it is, he'll give it his best.

389
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,880
I mean, we work together,

390
00:25:06,963 --> 00:25:09,841
but I could never tell
if there's something going on with him.

391
00:25:10,425 --> 00:25:12,260
But lately, I can.

392
00:25:12,886 --> 00:25:16,223
I can see that he misses you a lot
and he wants to visit you.

393
00:25:16,806 --> 00:25:17,933
Things like that.

394
00:25:20,894 --> 00:25:22,479
I guess I was being nosy again.

395
00:25:23,063 --> 00:25:26,483
Anyway, that's how Ji-yul is
when he's in Seoul.

396
00:25:26,566 --> 00:25:28,902
I'm sure you understand what it's like

397
00:25:28,985 --> 00:25:31,404
since you're in the same
long-distance relationship.

398
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:34,950
Okay, I really have to get going.

399
00:25:35,033 --> 00:25:35,992
-Yes.
-Okay.

400
00:25:36,076 --> 00:25:38,286
You could watch a movie while you wait.

401
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:39,412
Sure.

402
00:25:39,496 --> 00:25:40,497
Oh, here.

403
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:43,083
I'm sure you're tired
from driving for hours.

404
00:25:44,709 --> 00:25:45,961
Have one of these.

405
00:25:47,504 --> 00:25:50,215
These get me through
the long drives these days.

406
00:25:53,301 --> 00:25:54,219
Thank you.

407
00:25:54,803 --> 00:25:55,637
Let's go, long-distancers!

408
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,222
-Let's go.
-Let's go!

409
00:25:58,223 --> 00:26:00,058
-I'll see you later.
-Okay.

410
00:26:15,865 --> 00:26:17,200
You got here so quickly.

411
00:26:17,993 --> 00:26:20,912
I told you to drive carefully.
You have a bad arm.

412
00:26:20,996 --> 00:26:23,665
Why did you come all the way here?
I could come to you.

413
00:26:24,541 --> 00:26:25,875
You must have been so bored.

414
00:26:27,252 --> 00:26:28,253
Well, I thought

415
00:26:29,045 --> 00:26:31,923
about you living here in Seoul.

416
00:26:32,882 --> 00:26:34,342
Do you know what I realized?

417
00:26:34,426 --> 00:26:35,927
What did you realize?

418
00:26:36,011 --> 00:26:37,345
That if I want to see you,

419
00:26:38,013 --> 00:26:39,306
I should just come see you.

420
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:42,934
Whether you find it annoying or not,
I should just come often.

421
00:26:43,518 --> 00:26:44,644
That's what I realized.

422
00:26:47,522 --> 00:26:51,818
I have all these people who are
my moms and dads in Huidong,

423
00:26:51,901 --> 00:26:53,611
and I have friends too.

424
00:26:54,696 --> 00:26:57,615
But you have no one
besides Yun-hyeong here.

425
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:03,621
Once I realized that my loneliness
must be nothing compared to yours…

426
00:27:06,666 --> 00:27:08,043
I just wanted to give you a hug.

427
00:27:14,758 --> 00:27:16,801
The more I wanted to see you,

428
00:27:17,552 --> 00:27:19,929
the more I thought I shouldn't be whining.

429
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:23,266
We have a long way to go.

430
00:27:23,975 --> 00:27:26,728
But as of right now,
we can't do anything about it.

431
00:27:28,146 --> 00:27:31,941
And you must feel as frustrated as I do.

432
00:27:33,276 --> 00:27:37,489
That's why I didn't want to
make you worry.

433
00:27:42,118 --> 00:27:45,080
But I came to my senses
once I put myself in your shoes.

434
00:27:46,748 --> 00:27:47,582
I'm sorry.

435
00:27:48,792 --> 00:27:49,667
I mean it.

436
00:27:55,006 --> 00:27:58,468
So is your arm really okay?
When do you take the cast off?

437
00:27:58,551 --> 00:28:00,637
It'll heal in about a week.

438
00:28:02,305 --> 00:28:04,682
I told you it's just a hairline fracture.

439
00:28:07,477 --> 00:28:10,397
At least you didn't hurt your right arm.

440
00:28:11,272 --> 00:28:13,942
I know, I can get through
the day-to-day tasks just fine.

441
00:28:14,025 --> 00:28:17,445
I can eat, drive, and even shower.

442
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:22,283
And I can do this without a problem.

443
00:28:22,367 --> 00:28:24,953
I bet it's not as good as
using both hands.

444
00:28:29,249 --> 00:28:30,291
I bet it is.

445
00:28:37,006 --> 00:28:38,466
But you can't do this.

446
00:28:43,304 --> 00:28:44,305
What was that?

447
00:29:14,127 --> 00:29:17,589
We're supposed to go left here, right?

448
00:29:19,424 --> 00:29:20,633
-Hello.
-Hi.

449
00:29:20,717 --> 00:29:22,594
Are you trying to get somewhere?

450
00:29:22,677 --> 00:29:24,846
We're here for
the peach-picking experience.

451
00:29:24,929 --> 00:29:27,974
But we're not sure
which way to go from here.

452
00:29:28,057 --> 00:29:30,018
-Follow me.
-Thanks.

453
00:29:30,101 --> 00:29:31,060
THE PEACH-PICKING EXPERIENCE

454
00:29:31,144 --> 00:29:33,021
-We have to buy some.
-Look how fresh they are.

455
00:29:34,606 --> 00:29:36,274
-Have a great time.
-Thank you.

456
00:29:38,193 --> 00:29:40,570
Once you've picked the peaches,
you can put them here.

457
00:29:40,653 --> 00:29:41,696
You can head that way now.

458
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:42,697
-Over there?
-Yes.

459
00:29:42,781 --> 00:29:44,073
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

460
00:29:45,742 --> 00:29:47,869
Hey, I guided them here.

461
00:29:47,952 --> 00:29:48,787
Right.

462
00:29:50,997 --> 00:29:54,000
Hey, did you hear from him at all?

463
00:29:54,083 --> 00:29:55,168
From whom?

464
00:29:55,251 --> 00:29:57,796
Well, from Doctor Han.

465
00:29:57,879 --> 00:30:00,882
We talk every day.

466
00:30:01,758 --> 00:30:02,592
What?

467
00:30:02,675 --> 00:30:05,053
Did you two play video games at night
behind my back again?

468
00:30:05,136 --> 00:30:07,889
No, we didn't. It was just that one time.

469
00:30:07,972 --> 00:30:09,057
I'm not a game addict.

470
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:10,308
Excuse me.

471
00:30:10,391 --> 00:30:13,436
I saw you on social media
and came a long way here.

472
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:15,188
You're so handsome.

473
00:30:15,855 --> 00:30:17,982
-Could I get a picture with you?
-Oh, sure.

474
00:30:18,983 --> 00:30:20,235
Let me take one for you.

475
00:30:20,777 --> 00:30:21,736
Thank you.

476
00:30:23,863 --> 00:30:26,115
Okay. One, two, three.

477
00:30:27,909 --> 00:30:28,743
There you go.

478
00:30:29,494 --> 00:30:30,745
Thank you.

479
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:34,874
-Here. Take a look around.
-Okay.

480
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:43,007
I booked an appointment
to get Nurungji's puppies vaccinated.

481
00:30:43,091 --> 00:30:44,133
Really?

482
00:30:44,217 --> 00:30:45,844
Go. Director Han should be there.

483
00:30:45,927 --> 00:30:48,471
Okay. See you later.

484
00:30:59,941 --> 00:31:01,192
Oh, my gosh.

485
00:31:01,276 --> 00:31:03,903
Okay, let's go.

486
00:31:03,987 --> 00:31:04,988
Let's go.

487
00:31:05,655 --> 00:31:06,865
Let's go.

488
00:31:06,948 --> 00:31:08,825
HAN DEOK-JIN VETERINARY HOSPITAL

489
00:31:09,659 --> 00:31:10,743
Director Han.

490
00:31:16,291 --> 00:31:19,419
He said he'd be here. Has he gone out?

491
00:31:26,467 --> 00:31:27,302
What?

492
00:31:29,387 --> 00:31:31,472
What's this? Why are you here?

493
00:31:32,056 --> 00:31:34,100
We didn't say we'd meet up today.

494
00:31:34,183 --> 00:31:37,854
Sergeant Ahn Ja-young.
Congratulations on your promotion.

495
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:47,989
Thank you,
but what are you really doing here?

496
00:31:48,072 --> 00:31:49,157
Congratulate me too.

497
00:31:49,741 --> 00:31:51,826
I've become a director as of today.

498
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:52,785
Director?

499
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:55,496
At Han Deok-jin Veterinary Hospital.

500
00:31:56,623 --> 00:31:57,498
What?

501
00:31:57,582 --> 00:32:00,668
Where did Director Han
and his wife go again?

502
00:32:01,252 --> 00:32:02,670
They're traveling across the country.

503
00:32:03,838 --> 00:32:06,090
I paid for the expenses
as a retirement present.

504
00:32:06,925 --> 00:32:09,385
I'm not forced to be here
like last time, okay?

505
00:32:11,179 --> 00:32:12,138
I mean,

506
00:32:13,014 --> 00:32:14,766
-why…
-My grandfather

507
00:32:15,642 --> 00:32:17,894
is too old to be doing this job.

508
00:32:18,937 --> 00:32:21,397
He's been growing unwell with age.

509
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:25,193
But he held out as long as he could

510
00:32:25,276 --> 00:32:27,278
because he couldn't find a vet
for large animals.

511
00:32:27,362 --> 00:32:29,113
This year, I've noticed that

512
00:32:30,031 --> 00:32:31,366
he's been finding it more difficult.

513
00:32:32,283 --> 00:32:35,370
He asked me if I knew anyone
to take over his hospital,

514
00:32:36,746 --> 00:32:37,914
so I told him I would.

515
00:32:38,498 --> 00:32:42,335
So you left that nice hospital in Seoul
to come here?

516
00:32:43,711 --> 00:32:46,839
Treating livestock animals
wasn't what you signed up for initially.

517
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:49,509
If you're doing this because of me…

518
00:32:49,592 --> 00:32:50,635
I came for myself.

519
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:53,680
I'd be with nice people

520
00:32:54,347 --> 00:32:55,640
and the person I love.

521
00:32:57,684 --> 00:33:01,688
I want to live in this small village
with everyone being nosy about me.

522
00:33:02,355 --> 00:33:03,356
I really do.

523
00:33:06,901 --> 00:33:08,569
And I want to have babies
like Nurungji and Boksil did.

524
00:33:12,115 --> 00:33:14,033
You've lost your mind.

525
00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:18,913
Wait.

526
00:33:19,706 --> 00:33:21,582
The flower dye is gone now.

527
00:33:22,792 --> 00:33:24,210
It's been gone for a while.

528
00:33:34,762 --> 00:33:35,972
This year,

529
00:33:36,055 --> 00:33:37,849
let's dye all ten fingers.

530
00:33:40,184 --> 00:33:41,436
This will mark you as mine.

531
00:33:44,439 --> 00:33:45,857
Do you like it?

532
00:34:02,457 --> 00:34:03,291
It's pretty.

533
00:34:05,543 --> 00:34:08,713
It's too late to regret
having stepped into my boundaries now.

534
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:12,508
I'm going to be incredibly clingy now.

535
00:34:12,592 --> 00:34:14,844
I'll be coming straight here
after work every day

536
00:34:14,927 --> 00:34:18,639
and ask you what you had for breakfast
and what you'll have for dinner.

537
00:34:18,723 --> 00:34:19,932
I'll be so nosy.

538
00:34:20,933 --> 00:34:23,561
Just don't push me away
for smelling like cow poop,

539
00:34:24,103 --> 00:34:25,063
Sergeant Ahn.

540
00:34:46,042 --> 00:34:46,876
I'd like that.

541
00:34:53,883 --> 00:34:55,009
The weather's so nice.

542
00:35:34,507 --> 00:35:35,633
BASED ON THE WEB NOVEL
ONCE UPON A SMALL TOWN BY BAK HA-MIN

543
