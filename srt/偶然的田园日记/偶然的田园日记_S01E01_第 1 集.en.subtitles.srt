1
00:01:15,116 --> 00:01:15,992
Let's see.

2
00:01:16,826 --> 00:01:18,495
How is Mr. Walnut?

3
00:01:18,578 --> 00:01:21,247
It's a typical case
of Brachycephalic Syndrome.

4
00:01:21,331 --> 00:01:23,792
Short-snouted dogs like him

5
00:01:23,875 --> 00:01:26,252
tend to have upper respiratory conditions.

6
00:01:26,878 --> 00:01:29,339
This isn't his first time
and he's an old dog.

7
00:01:29,422 --> 00:01:32,884
So I think we need to have
a closer look at his throat.

8
00:01:33,676 --> 00:01:35,512
Doctor, your phone.

9
00:01:36,137 --> 00:01:38,431
It's okay. It's a spam call.

10
00:01:40,892 --> 00:01:43,520
The exam is quite simple,

11
00:01:43,603 --> 00:01:45,438
but it requires full anesthesia,

12
00:01:45,522 --> 00:01:48,233
so it could be hard
on an old dog like him.

13
00:01:48,316 --> 00:01:50,860
-I see.
-Good job. See you next week.

14
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:54,447
-Let's go.
-Thank you.

15
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:03,414
ASSISTANT LEE

16
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,550
Hi, Ms. Lee. What's up?

17
00:02:20,557 --> 00:02:22,433
-Give me your car key.
-Why?

18
00:02:22,517 --> 00:02:23,977
-I'm taking your car, okay?
-Why?

19
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:25,603
Hey, why?

20
00:02:34,237 --> 00:02:36,114
GRANDPA

21
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:40,827
The person you're calling is unavailable.
Please leave a…

22
00:02:41,911 --> 00:02:42,745
GRANDPA

23
00:02:46,082 --> 00:02:47,417
The phone is turned off…

24
00:02:50,086 --> 00:02:51,629
The person you're calling…

25
00:02:51,713 --> 00:02:53,756
The phone is turned off, and you…

26
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,676
The person you're calling is unavailable.
Please leave a…

27
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:16,571
HUIDONG

28
00:03:30,835 --> 00:03:31,669
Grandpa!

29
00:03:32,378 --> 00:03:33,421
Grandpa!

30
00:03:35,173 --> 00:03:36,132
Grandpa!

31
00:03:40,178 --> 00:03:42,055
Damn it. What do I do?

32
00:03:50,271 --> 00:03:51,272
Hello?

33
00:03:51,356 --> 00:03:54,901
Were there any accidents reported
in Huidong today?

34
00:03:58,446 --> 00:03:59,405
Okay, thank you.

35
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:01,824
Damn it.

36
00:04:14,712 --> 00:04:16,339
What do you think you're doing?

37
00:04:19,175 --> 00:04:20,051
I'm just…

38
00:04:20,843 --> 00:04:22,595
It's not what you think.

39
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:26,391
I just need to check something in there.

40
00:04:26,474 --> 00:04:28,226
I'll explain afterward, so please just--

41
00:04:28,309 --> 00:04:30,895
Someone suspicious is trying to escape.
Requesting backup.

42
00:04:31,521 --> 00:04:32,772
No!

43
00:04:32,855 --> 00:04:35,733
I just want to check
if someone is in the house!

44
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:39,362
Some petty thief has been
roaming around these past few weeks,

45
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:41,739
stealing pocket money from the elderly.

46
00:04:41,823 --> 00:04:45,285
No matter how much you deny it,
I need to check who you are.

47
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:47,453
-So show me your ID.
-All right!

48
00:04:47,537 --> 00:04:49,122
Here.

49
00:04:51,249 --> 00:04:55,461
So why were you trying to climb the wall
of an empty house on this rainy…

50
00:04:59,173 --> 00:05:00,758
DRIVER'S LICENSE
NAME: HAN JI-YUL

51
00:05:00,842 --> 00:05:01,926
Empty house?

52
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:04,178
This house is empty?

53
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:07,473
What do you mean, this house is empty?

54
00:05:07,557 --> 00:05:10,810
I'm their grandson,
so tell me what you know.

55
00:05:10,893 --> 00:05:13,730
Come on, where did they go?

56
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:16,065
Well, they…

57
00:05:16,941 --> 00:05:18,568
-They…
-Hey! Get your hands off her!

58
00:05:26,034 --> 00:05:27,285
Are you okay?

59
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:30,163
What?

60
00:05:56,606 --> 00:05:58,441
-What the heck?
-He's awake!

61
00:05:58,524 --> 00:05:59,567
Are you all right?

62
00:06:00,401 --> 00:06:02,236
Can you tell us your name?

63
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:06,866
Han Ji-yul.

64
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:12,830
This was the closest building,

65
00:06:12,914 --> 00:06:15,541
so we brought you here
to treat you right away.

66
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:17,668
It's still a hospital.

67
00:06:18,669 --> 00:06:22,048
Do you have any other symptoms
like nausea or dizziness?

68
00:06:25,718 --> 00:06:26,552
No.

69
00:06:30,473 --> 00:06:31,307
Grandpa.

70
00:06:31,849 --> 00:06:32,975
What about my grandpa?

71
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:36,938
He and his wife went
on a cruise this morning.

72
00:06:37,021 --> 00:06:38,147
They're both just fine.

73
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:40,733
I even called them a cab to the airport.

74
00:06:41,859 --> 00:06:43,111
You can trust me.

75
00:06:46,405 --> 00:06:47,657
What about that phone call?

76
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:50,743
I just did what I was told, Little Doctor.

77
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:54,122
They forced me to do it, really.

78
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:57,125
Wait, so you mean…

79
00:06:57,208 --> 00:07:00,545
"Hurry," "You should come immediately,"
"There's not much time left."

80
00:07:00,628 --> 00:07:02,421
All of that was about the flight?

81
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:06,217
I'm just a pawn.

82
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:07,844
A powerless pawn.

83
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:08,803
What is this?

84
00:07:08,886 --> 00:07:12,014
The keys to the house and the hospital
that the director told me to give you.

85
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:12,932
But why?

86
00:07:13,015 --> 00:07:15,184
Hey, what happened?

87
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:16,769
You knocked out a civilian?

88
00:07:16,853 --> 00:07:18,229
Oh, my.

89
00:07:18,312 --> 00:07:21,274
I am so sorry about this.
Are you hurt at all?

90
00:07:21,357 --> 00:07:22,358
No.

91
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:25,528
I'm sorry. I thought he was
trying to harm Officer Ahn.

92
00:07:28,072 --> 00:07:28,906
I'm sorry.

93
00:07:31,242 --> 00:07:33,661
He's Director Han's grandson.

94
00:07:33,744 --> 00:07:35,163
He came after he got a call,

95
00:07:35,246 --> 00:07:38,124
-but I think there was a misunderstanding.
-Director Han's grandson?

96
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:40,042
Director Han of this place?

97
00:07:51,637 --> 00:07:52,805
Here.

98
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:57,268
Grandpa.

99
00:07:57,351 --> 00:07:59,729
Yeong-suk didn't use
the words "critical condition."

100
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:01,647
Were you startled?

101
00:08:02,607 --> 00:08:04,442
What in the world is going on?

102
00:08:04,525 --> 00:08:06,486
Yeong-suk didn't do anything wrong.

103
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:09,906
I left a letter for you at the house,
so read that.

104
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:14,160
And look after the hospital
until we return.

105
00:08:14,243 --> 00:08:16,579
There's only one veterinary hospital
in the village.

106
00:08:16,662 --> 00:08:19,874
There must be at least one vet.
That's why I had you come.

107
00:08:19,957 --> 00:08:21,834
-Honey, where are the passports?
-What?

108
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:23,002
Passports?

109
00:08:23,085 --> 00:08:24,462
Hang on a moment.

110
00:08:24,545 --> 00:08:27,215
Anyway, I take it that you understand.
Bye now.

111
00:08:27,298 --> 00:08:29,217
No! Wait, Grandpa.

112
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:32,762
I also work at a hospital, Grandpa.
Did you forget?

113
00:08:32,845 --> 00:08:35,181
I just talked to Yun-hyeong.

114
00:08:35,264 --> 00:08:37,934
He says the hospital will run
just fine without you.

115
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:39,644
That's not true.

116
00:08:39,727 --> 00:08:41,521
Where are the passports?

117
00:08:41,604 --> 00:08:44,273
Check the front pocket of the bag.

118
00:08:45,316 --> 00:08:46,901
I really have to go now.

119
00:08:46,984 --> 00:08:50,738
And Han Ji-yul,
don't try so hard to do a good job.

120
00:08:50,821 --> 00:08:53,324
Just keep that in mind.
I'm really hanging up now.

121
00:08:55,326 --> 00:08:56,244
Grandpa…

122
00:08:58,704 --> 00:09:03,584
Oh, my. The director is such a prankster.

123
00:09:03,668 --> 00:09:05,836
I mean, isn't he too old
to pull such a prank?

124
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:08,089
He can really freak someone out.

125
00:09:14,845 --> 00:09:18,933
Anyways, regarding
the excessive use of force earlier,

126
00:09:19,016 --> 00:09:21,936
-as the chief of Sandeul Police Station…
-Hey, guys.

127
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:23,729
You can save all that for later.

128
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:25,856
Take a look at this one's right leg first.

129
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:27,733
I've been waiting for a while now.

130
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:28,985
What?

131
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:30,152
Here.

132
00:09:32,154 --> 00:09:37,410
HAN DEOK-JIN VETERINARY HOSPITAL

133
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:50,381
Excuse me.

134
00:09:55,303 --> 00:09:56,137
Mr. Han Ji-yul.

135
00:09:59,056 --> 00:09:59,890
Go ahead.

136
00:10:17,241 --> 00:10:18,117
What is it?

137
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:30,463
I'm sorry.

138
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:34,091
I shouldn't have done that
when we had just met.

139
00:10:40,264 --> 00:10:41,098
Okay.

140
00:10:42,516 --> 00:10:43,517
Wait.

141
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:47,355
Get in.

142
00:10:51,275 --> 00:10:52,151
It's okay.

143
00:10:52,818 --> 00:10:55,237
I have a lot to think about,
so I'll just walk back.

144
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:57,281
Please get in. It's an emergency.

145
00:10:58,866 --> 00:11:00,284
I'm telling you.

146
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:03,287
Five minutes after you left,
he called and went,

147
00:11:04,747 --> 00:11:06,540
"You're my grandson too, right?"

148
00:11:06,624 --> 00:11:08,250
And he practically begged.

149
00:11:09,293 --> 00:11:11,754
Hey, those two have worked so hard
all these years,

150
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:13,839
and they're finally going on one trip.

151
00:11:13,923 --> 00:11:15,758
Can't you just do it for them?

152
00:11:15,841 --> 00:11:18,135
I told him to not worry.
You agree with me, right?

153
00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:19,804
But how will you manage?

154
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:22,348
I relied on you and goofed off a little.

155
00:11:22,431 --> 00:11:25,684
But I can handle the workload
if I put my mind to it.

156
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:28,020
I already gave my fellow vets a heads-up.

157
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:30,481
So don't worry about a thing over here,

158
00:11:30,564 --> 00:11:33,317
and think of it as repaying them
for what they did for you.

159
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:36,278
If you need clothes or anything,
I'll send them over.

160
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:37,571
Just text me the address.

161
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:38,489
All right.

162
00:11:39,156 --> 00:11:41,325
Thanks. I'll call you again later.

163
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:50,126
This can't be your first time in Huidong.

164
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:51,877
When did you last come to visit?

165
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:56,507
I'm just asking out of curiosity.

166
00:12:02,304 --> 00:12:03,347
Careful!

167
00:12:11,522 --> 00:12:13,107
Hey, are you okay?

168
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:17,403
Why were you standing
in the middle of the road?

169
00:12:17,486 --> 00:12:18,821
You were distracted!

170
00:12:18,904 --> 00:12:21,574
I was not! You just popped out of nowhere!

171
00:12:23,951 --> 00:12:24,910
I…

172
00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:27,079
I'm sorry, okay?

173
00:12:27,163 --> 00:12:28,914
Is this a new shirt? Oh, no.

174
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:31,625
Oh, my. Your butt.
I'm so sorry about this.

175
00:12:31,709 --> 00:12:34,128
And your hair. This is bad.

176
00:12:35,004 --> 00:12:36,839
Why are you looking at me like that?

177
00:12:36,922 --> 00:12:37,798
Are you mad?

178
00:12:37,882 --> 00:12:39,758
Anyone can make a mistake.

179
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:43,262
Hey, I'm sorry.

180
00:12:43,345 --> 00:12:45,389
I'll wash it for you.

181
00:12:45,473 --> 00:12:47,933
See you later, okay?
I have to go to Mr. Cho's place.

182
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:49,310
Okay? I'm sorry.

183
00:12:51,896 --> 00:12:53,230
Bye!

184
00:13:02,156 --> 00:13:04,992
Don't be distracted
while you're driving, idiot!

185
00:13:07,912 --> 00:13:09,038
Wait, who was that guy?

186
00:13:10,915 --> 00:13:11,999
Hey,

187
00:13:12,082 --> 00:13:14,251
is it okay to just leave like this?

188
00:13:15,002 --> 00:13:16,086
It's fine.

189
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:18,589
One way or another,
that boy will die at my hands.

190
00:13:19,256 --> 00:13:20,466
I wasn't distracted.

191
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:38,359
Mr. Cho.

192
00:13:39,068 --> 00:13:40,236
Hey there!

193
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:44,823
Turns out, I didn't have to call you.

194
00:13:44,907 --> 00:13:46,742
-What?
-I mean,

195
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:48,285
don't even get me started.

196
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:52,289
I thought this one was a goner
and my heart sank.

197
00:13:52,998 --> 00:13:56,877
But apparently,
it was just faking it to survive.

198
00:13:56,961 --> 00:13:58,504
Look.

199
00:14:01,131 --> 00:14:02,091
Look at her go!

200
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:05,219
-That's a relief.
-Right?

201
00:14:07,304 --> 00:14:09,473
But as for that damn dog, I ought to…

202
00:14:24,321 --> 00:14:25,197
Oh, my…

203
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:27,324
It's been caught.

204
00:14:27,408 --> 00:14:28,367
As it should have.

205
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:32,037
This one's killed seven chickens
over the last month.

206
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:34,540
Get rid of this thing for me, Officer Ahn.

207
00:14:34,623 --> 00:14:38,294
You could toss him into one of those
facilities that take care of dogs.

208
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:41,714
It needs to be treated first.

209
00:14:41,797 --> 00:14:43,424
If not, it may never walk again.

210
00:14:43,507 --> 00:14:44,550
"Treated"?

211
00:14:45,175 --> 00:14:46,343
Don't you watch the news?

212
00:14:46,427 --> 00:14:48,637
You can't think of this as just a dog.

213
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:51,265
It's gone completely feral
and it raids chicken pens.

214
00:14:51,348 --> 00:14:52,766
What do you mean, treat it?

215
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:56,270
Even criminals in prison
receive treatment if they're sick.

216
00:14:58,689 --> 00:15:01,066
Also, you set this trap
to catch this dog, right?

217
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:04,403
Of course! It's been killing my chickens.
I couldn't just sit and watch.

218
00:15:04,486 --> 00:15:06,739
Intentionally setting a rat trap
to catch a dog

219
00:15:06,822 --> 00:15:08,657
is a violation of animal protection law.

220
00:15:09,366 --> 00:15:10,409
It's illegal.

221
00:15:16,248 --> 00:15:19,335
Do you know how many rats
there are in the countryside?

222
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:22,504
I set it up for rats
but this one went and got caught in it.

223
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:24,173
What do you mean, illegal?

224
00:15:24,965 --> 00:15:27,927
You just said you set the trap
to catch the dog.

225
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:29,053
And we have a witness.

226
00:15:29,678 --> 00:15:31,138
One who's very close to the law.

227
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:42,983
I'll go talk to him.

228
00:15:48,822 --> 00:15:49,698
So…

229
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:54,078
He didn't know it was illegal,
and it was his first time.

230
00:15:54,161 --> 00:15:58,123
I'll give him a fair warning
and make sure he doesn't do it again.

231
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:01,919
And let's send the dog to a shelter
after the treatment.

232
00:16:02,002 --> 00:16:02,920
They'll take care of it.

233
00:16:05,506 --> 00:16:08,592
Dogs like this one get euthanized
at those facilities.

234
00:16:11,595 --> 00:16:15,015
I'm sure you want to help the pitiful dog
since you're a vet,

235
00:16:15,099 --> 00:16:16,475
but I'm a police officer here.

236
00:16:16,558 --> 00:16:19,645
So I have to think of the resident
who's lost his property.

237
00:16:19,728 --> 00:16:22,439
Whatever the case,
the dog destroyed his property.

238
00:16:22,523 --> 00:16:25,150
So are you saying
that dog deserves to die?

239
00:16:25,234 --> 00:16:26,110
What?

240
00:16:26,735 --> 00:16:28,779
That's not what I said.

241
00:16:28,862 --> 00:16:32,908
Do you think we should release that dog
after it's been treated then?

242
00:16:33,617 --> 00:16:35,786
Pitiful or not, chicken or dog,

243
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:38,998
I'm saying it would be wrong
to just leave them to die.

244
00:16:39,081 --> 00:16:41,750
It's not the dog's fault
that it got abandoned.

245
00:16:43,627 --> 00:16:44,920
Officer Ahn!

246
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:46,463
I called him to take a look
at the chicken,

247
00:16:47,047 --> 00:16:49,383
but he's talking about
treating the dog that hurt it

248
00:16:49,967 --> 00:16:53,220
and he's telling me what's legal or not?
What the heck is this?

249
00:16:54,471 --> 00:16:55,305
Well…

250
00:16:55,389 --> 00:16:59,768
And if you treat it and release it,
it will definitely come back.

251
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:00,894
You can't do that!

252
00:17:02,813 --> 00:17:07,192
I'll take it to the hospital for now
and check if it has a microchip.

253
00:17:07,276 --> 00:17:09,278
If not, I'll keep it there
for the time being.

254
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:12,239
I can go now, right?

255
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:16,535
You should do your job properly.

256
00:17:16,618 --> 00:17:19,538
Don't go easy on him
just because he's your neighbor.

257
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:24,960
That little…

258
00:17:55,783 --> 00:17:57,034
Luckily, there's no fracture.

259
00:17:57,618 --> 00:17:59,828
-Let's do a blood test first.
-Okay.

260
00:18:17,805 --> 00:18:19,598
-Do you have something to say?
-Yes.

261
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:22,434
Go ahead then.

262
00:18:24,478 --> 00:18:25,437
I'd rather not.

263
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:31,235
Hello?

264
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:33,821
Right now?

265
00:18:36,615 --> 00:18:38,700
Okay. Yes, I'll be there soon.

266
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:39,743
Yes.

267
00:18:40,536 --> 00:18:42,454
It's the goat guy.

268
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:45,082
Oh, no. He did say
he was going to house a buck.

269
00:18:45,165 --> 00:18:47,417
I knew this was going to happen.
What did it ram into?

270
00:18:47,501 --> 00:18:48,710
Not another buck, right?

271
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:50,838
A pipe. He's bleeding a lot.

272
00:18:51,547 --> 00:18:54,258
I'll be checking this one's anus and ears,

273
00:18:54,341 --> 00:18:57,261
so go with Officer Ahn.
It's within walking distance.

274
00:18:57,886 --> 00:19:00,639
And take this.
Everything you need is in there.

275
00:19:03,016 --> 00:19:03,976
Go where?

276
00:19:04,059 --> 00:19:05,227
Didn't you hear?

277
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:08,814
All hell breaks loose
when goats are in heat.

278
00:19:10,023 --> 00:19:11,441
But it's time to go home.

279
00:19:12,484 --> 00:19:14,486
What's that? I don't know what that means.

280
00:19:15,237 --> 00:19:16,446
I'm sorry?

281
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:18,574
We're never off work here.

282
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:19,700
We're always on call.

283
00:19:19,783 --> 00:19:22,995
You'll be here for a few months,
so keep that in mind.

284
00:19:23,078 --> 00:19:26,790
Around here, you go wherever
and whenever they call you.

285
00:19:26,874 --> 00:19:29,501
Day or night, weekends or holidays.

286
00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:31,378
As long as you're alive.

287
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:32,880
All done.

288
00:19:40,137 --> 00:19:42,306
What are you doing? Let's get going.

289
00:19:45,767 --> 00:19:47,311
Go. Follow her.

290
00:19:57,821 --> 00:19:58,739
I mean…

291
00:19:59,573 --> 00:20:01,366
This is a shortcut.

292
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:06,121
By the way,

293
00:20:06,663 --> 00:20:08,874
when animals get sick,

294
00:20:08,957 --> 00:20:11,251
why does everyone call you

295
00:20:11,335 --> 00:20:12,669
and not the hospital?

296
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:15,130
It's the quickest solution.

297
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:24,056
-Oh, my gosh!
-Come on!

298
00:20:24,681 --> 00:20:26,141
Are you okay? My goodness.

299
00:20:28,936 --> 00:20:30,896
-For crying out loud.
-Oh, no.

300
00:20:36,777 --> 00:20:37,945
Goodness.

301
00:21:58,859 --> 00:21:59,985
No. Hey.

302
00:22:00,068 --> 00:22:03,864
Why are you doing that? Hey, hold on!

303
00:22:03,947 --> 00:22:07,284
Good boy. Wait, what's wrong with you?

304
00:22:23,133 --> 00:22:27,637
-Come on. Just leave it by the door.
-It's fine.

305
00:22:27,721 --> 00:22:29,765
-We'll leave soon.
-Oh, my goodness!

306
00:22:29,848 --> 00:22:30,974
Who are you?

307
00:22:31,058 --> 00:22:33,226
If you were home, why didn't…

308
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:35,979
I mean, you were home.
Wait, what happened to your clothes?

309
00:22:36,063 --> 00:22:37,522
Did you get hurt?

310
00:22:37,606 --> 00:22:38,899
No?

311
00:22:38,982 --> 00:22:42,069
If you're fine, wash up a little later.
Let us in.

312
00:22:46,615 --> 00:22:49,785
-Gosh, it's so heavy.
-Goodness, so heavy.

313
00:22:49,868 --> 00:22:51,036
Jeez.

314
00:22:51,787 --> 00:22:53,163
Let's see what's in here.

315
00:22:53,246 --> 00:22:54,331
My goodness.

316
00:22:54,414 --> 00:22:56,041
There are a lot of things in there.

317
00:22:56,583 --> 00:23:00,837
His grandma made him so much food
so he wouldn't starve.

318
00:23:00,921 --> 00:23:02,923
-All right. Just open them up.
-Yes.

319
00:23:03,006 --> 00:23:04,382
-We'll set them here.
-What is…

320
00:23:04,466 --> 00:23:06,009
-You organize them.
-No, this…

321
00:23:06,676 --> 00:23:09,012
Could you start by telling me
who you are first?

322
00:23:09,096 --> 00:23:11,431
Oh, us? Sure.

323
00:23:11,515 --> 00:23:12,974
Just a second.

324
00:23:13,058 --> 00:23:16,019
All right. Let me show you. Here.

325
00:23:16,603 --> 00:23:18,688
That's right.
And you have to replace that doorbell.

326
00:23:18,772 --> 00:23:19,815
HUIDONG WOMEN'S ASSOCIATION
PRESIDENT JANG SE-RYEON

327
00:23:19,898 --> 00:23:22,984
I pressed it countless times,
but no one answered.

328
00:23:23,068 --> 00:23:25,987
So we thought no one was home
and let ourselves in,

329
00:23:26,071 --> 00:23:28,657
and here you are, a pleasant surprise.

330
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:33,411
You let yourselves in
when you thought no one was home?

331
00:23:33,495 --> 00:23:34,996
Yes!

332
00:23:35,956 --> 00:23:38,875
Gosh, we knew Director Han was handsome,

333
00:23:38,959 --> 00:23:40,836
but we didn't know his grandson was too.

334
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:43,713
How can he be so handsome
like a chiseled statue?

335
00:23:44,881 --> 00:23:46,508
Look at that! Wow!

336
00:23:46,591 --> 00:23:48,343
He's certainly not a block of tofu.

337
00:23:49,344 --> 00:23:52,722
I was worried livestock would be
too tough for a city boy.

338
00:23:52,806 --> 00:23:54,641
But he seems pretty strong.

339
00:23:59,396 --> 00:24:00,814
Just a second.

340
00:24:01,481 --> 00:24:04,860
You can't just barge in like this
without any prior explanation.

341
00:24:04,943 --> 00:24:06,236
If this happened in Seoul,

342
00:24:06,319 --> 00:24:08,864
the police would have charged you
with breaking and entering.

343
00:24:16,204 --> 00:24:17,164
We've got the police right here.

344
00:24:18,707 --> 00:24:20,250
"Police."

345
00:24:20,876 --> 00:24:22,210
What?

346
00:24:30,385 --> 00:24:31,261
Jeez.

347
00:24:34,681 --> 00:24:36,224
Look here, Doctor Han.

348
00:24:37,559 --> 00:24:40,812
Pink lid, perilla leaves.
Blue lid, lettuce kimchi.

349
00:24:40,896 --> 00:24:42,439
Green lid, radish kimchi.

350
00:24:42,522 --> 00:24:44,482
Okay? And the plastic lid is eggplant.

351
00:24:45,066 --> 00:24:47,319
Breaking and entering, calling the police…

352
00:24:47,402 --> 00:24:49,905
You can preach that crap in Seoul…

353
00:24:49,988 --> 00:24:51,948
I mean, you can talk about it.

354
00:24:52,032 --> 00:24:54,951
Just remember the colors of the lids
and enjoy the dishes.

355
00:24:55,035 --> 00:24:58,580
Our women's association
poured our hearts and souls into them.

356
00:24:58,663 --> 00:25:02,167
And if you open the lids too often,
they'll go bad. Okay?

357
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:03,251
-But I still…
-No…

358
00:25:04,002 --> 00:25:07,172
They heard Director Han's grandson
had come from Seoul,

359
00:25:07,255 --> 00:25:09,841
so they came to give you
some side dishes they'd made.

360
00:25:09,925 --> 00:25:11,551
But no one answered,

361
00:25:11,635 --> 00:25:14,095
and the door was unlocked,
so we came inside.

362
00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:16,348
We're sorry if we offended you.

363
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:21,186
Let's go now.

364
00:25:21,269 --> 00:25:24,606
-Auntie, let's go. He needs to rest.
-Okay, let's.

365
00:25:24,689 --> 00:25:27,692
Gosh, we came to share some food
only to get an earful.

366
00:25:27,776 --> 00:25:28,985
Can't say it feels good.

367
00:25:32,239 --> 00:25:33,198
Jeez.

368
00:25:35,283 --> 00:25:36,743
Anyway…

369
00:25:36,826 --> 00:25:37,661
Come on.

370
00:25:38,703 --> 00:25:43,291
We didn't mean to startle you like that.
We're sorry.

371
00:25:44,334 --> 00:25:48,088
We all meant well,
so please understand and rest well.

372
00:25:48,171 --> 00:25:52,634
After all, it's your first day in Huidong.

373
00:25:54,678 --> 00:25:58,431
I heard you'll be staying for a while,
so here's a tip.

374
00:25:59,182 --> 00:26:01,351
If you say you don't need something,
we give it to you.

375
00:26:01,434 --> 00:26:03,770
If you say you do,
we give you more than you need.

376
00:26:03,853 --> 00:26:06,606
That's just how people are around here.

377
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:10,485
Your grandparents are like that too.

378
00:26:11,695 --> 00:26:13,571
All right.

379
00:26:14,948 --> 00:26:16,533
Put that down.

380
00:26:24,332 --> 00:26:27,210
We don't have smart locks around here,

381
00:26:27,294 --> 00:26:31,047
so if you don't want to get robbed,
make sure to lock up.

382
00:26:32,299 --> 00:26:33,758
Don't worry. I will.

383
00:26:36,344 --> 00:26:39,014
Their side dishes are really delicious.

384
00:26:39,097 --> 00:26:42,100
So don't let them all spoil
and at least try them a little.

385
00:26:44,686 --> 00:26:46,229
I can take care of myself.

386
00:26:53,737 --> 00:26:55,071
I really doubt that.

387
00:27:04,539 --> 00:27:05,707
Have a good night.

388
00:27:13,506 --> 00:27:14,549
That was exhausting.

389
00:27:15,342 --> 00:27:17,344
Animals, people, the whole lot.

390
00:27:32,650 --> 00:27:35,528
I know this is quite sudden,
and you must be very shocked.

391
00:27:36,404 --> 00:27:39,699
And I know you've worked hard
for the life you've established in Seoul.

392
00:27:40,408 --> 00:27:43,119
So it makes me feel really bad

393
00:27:43,787 --> 00:27:45,330
to jokingly burden you like this.

394
00:27:52,253 --> 00:27:53,296
But Ji-yul…

395
00:27:54,381 --> 00:27:56,216
I looked back,

396
00:27:56,800 --> 00:28:00,887
and it's been 50 years
since your grandma and I got married.

397
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:02,430
HAN DEOK-JIN VETERINARY HOSPITAL

398
00:28:03,932 --> 00:28:08,895
It was your grandma's dream
to travel the world on a big ship,

399
00:28:11,606 --> 00:28:13,900
and I had put her through
so much for so long.

400
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:17,779
I've put her through more hardship
than she deserves.

401
00:28:20,073 --> 00:28:22,867
After seeing her son
and her daughter-in-law pass away,

402
00:28:24,285 --> 00:28:28,331
she's been living like
she's already half-dead all this time.

403
00:28:30,208 --> 00:28:32,085
I decided to take her on this trip

404
00:28:32,168 --> 00:28:35,380
to make her wish
from her twenties come true

405
00:28:36,005 --> 00:28:37,632
before it was too late.

406
00:28:39,134 --> 00:28:44,139
But now I'm worried about you,
who's in the most critical moment in life.

407
00:28:47,142 --> 00:28:51,271
Could you please forgive
your goofball of a grandfather…

408
00:28:53,857 --> 00:28:55,525
who jokes and laughs away his shame?

409
00:29:02,198 --> 00:29:03,366
It's confusing, isn't it?

410
00:29:30,727 --> 00:29:37,734
HAN DEOK-JIN VETERINARY HOSPITAL

411
00:30:48,763 --> 00:30:49,681
You…

412
00:31:17,333 --> 00:31:18,543
Do I need to get a bed?

413
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:20,378
Move it!

414
00:31:20,461 --> 00:31:22,297
Some work environment.

415
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:23,882
Why are you taking it out on the rock?

416
00:31:23,965 --> 00:31:25,341
Hey, are you okay?

417
00:31:25,425 --> 00:31:27,010
How could I be okay?

418
00:31:27,093 --> 00:31:28,428
There's really a thief in this town?

419
00:31:28,511 --> 00:31:29,387
Who are you?

420
00:31:30,221 --> 00:31:32,557
Did you get conned by someone
who looked like me?

421
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:35,184
I did get conned by someone
who looked like this.

422
00:31:35,268 --> 00:31:38,521
But that person seems
to have forgotten about it.

423
00:31:38,605 --> 00:31:43,151
