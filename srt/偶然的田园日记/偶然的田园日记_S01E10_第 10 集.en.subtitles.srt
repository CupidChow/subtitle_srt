1
00:00:43,752 --> 00:00:44,586
Ji-yul.

2
00:00:46,129 --> 00:00:48,089
You are going to go back to Seoul, right?

3
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:50,550
I should.

4
00:00:51,217 --> 00:00:52,510
My hospital is there.

5
00:00:52,594 --> 00:00:54,846
I'll be working in Korea
starting next month.

6
00:00:54,929 --> 00:00:56,514
Near your hospital.

7
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:00,351
-Min.
-I don't expect us

8
00:01:00,435 --> 00:01:01,811
to be close like before immediately.

9
00:01:02,437 --> 00:01:03,855
I'm sure you need time.

10
00:01:04,397 --> 00:01:06,858
You'll change once you start
seeing me more often.

11
00:01:06,941 --> 00:01:08,902
Like you and Officer Ahn right now.

12
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:14,074
It's natural to develop feelings
for someone who helps you out

13
00:01:14,616 --> 00:01:16,409
in an unfamiliar place.

14
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:20,580
But you'll forget about it
once you go back to your normal life.

15
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:23,249
You're going back to Seoul.

16
00:01:25,585 --> 00:01:26,586
Min.

17
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:28,171
I…

18
00:02:11,381 --> 00:02:13,007
You two should share it.

19
00:02:30,942 --> 00:02:31,901
Officer Ahn!

20
00:02:35,405 --> 00:02:36,239
Officer Ahn!

21
00:02:36,322 --> 00:02:37,407
Officer Ahn.

22
00:02:39,576 --> 00:02:40,910
You forgot your bicycle.

23
00:02:41,786 --> 00:02:43,872
-Thank you.
-About what you saw earlier…

24
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:48,126
You don't need to explain that to me.

25
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:03,224
Hey, Han Ji-yul.

26
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:05,101
Where are you?

27
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:08,396
Don't come near me. Hey, where are you?

28
00:04:33,606 --> 00:04:34,440
Ji-yul.

29
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:43,574
Were you battling something else
while I was battling that goat?

30
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:47,745
Man, I'm exhausted.

31
00:04:50,164 --> 00:04:51,207
Come on, what is it?

32
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:54,502
Tell me what's on your mind.

33
00:04:55,837 --> 00:04:57,547
I'm sure it's not about Min.

34
00:04:58,131 --> 00:05:00,883
Is it about that nosy girl
who made you run out all of a sudden?

35
00:05:03,386 --> 00:05:06,639
You should change your line of work.
You'd make a lot of money.

36
00:05:07,557 --> 00:05:10,727
I do have an incredible knack
for reading faces.

37
00:05:11,269 --> 00:05:14,605
But with your situation,
I bet anyone could figure it out.

38
00:05:14,689 --> 00:05:16,232
Anyone besides you, that is.

39
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:19,736
You're so concerned
and can't stop thinking about her.

40
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:22,864
How could you not know what it means?
You're such a smart guy.

41
00:05:23,573 --> 00:05:25,575
You just didn't want to admit it.

42
00:05:26,242 --> 00:05:28,870
"No way. There's no way
I'd actually like that nosy girl."

43
00:05:28,953 --> 00:05:30,371
"So what if I do like her?"

44
00:05:31,205 --> 00:05:33,708
You were probably looking
for reasons not to.

45
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:36,502
Well, at least you realize it now.

46
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:37,962
So what? What's the problem?

47
00:05:38,046 --> 00:05:39,797
Is it the long-distance relationship?

48
00:05:39,881 --> 00:05:42,008
Or is it the fact that it's one-sided?

49
00:05:42,091 --> 00:05:43,718
If it's not either of those things,

50
00:05:43,801 --> 00:05:45,887
is there some rival that you must defeat?

51
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:51,225
My goodness. It's all of the above.

52
00:05:53,394 --> 00:05:55,605
Confess your feelings to her first.

53
00:05:55,688 --> 00:05:57,857
Then you'll know
if the feelings are mutual,

54
00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:00,526
and it'll solve the rival problem.

55
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:04,238
Just do it. Tell her how you feel. Okay?

56
00:06:04,322 --> 00:06:06,032
There's no tomorrow without today.

57
00:06:07,784 --> 00:06:08,659
Jeez.

58
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:12,163
If you want to keep living like you have,
don't bother telling her.

59
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:15,249
But you don't want to live
like that anymore.

60
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:18,211
Right? You want to be with her, don't you?

61
00:06:32,308 --> 00:06:33,267
If this is

62
00:06:33,976 --> 00:06:35,770
about what I saw earlier,

63
00:06:36,854 --> 00:06:39,941
I don't think there's a reason
for us to feel uncomfortable about it.

64
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:41,442
Ji-yul

65
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:43,528
went after you.

66
00:06:45,029 --> 00:06:48,449
How could I not
feel uncomfortable about it?

67
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:53,287
That's because I was acting
so obviously shocked.

68
00:06:53,371 --> 00:06:56,249
I dropped everything I was carrying
and just left.

69
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:59,460
I'm sure he was just surprised
by my reaction.

70
00:06:59,544 --> 00:07:01,129
A bit embarrassed too.

71
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:05,299
Officer Ahn, may I ask you something?

72
00:07:07,301 --> 00:07:09,387
Is Han Ji-yul

73
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:11,681
really just a friend to you?

74
00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:17,019
Did it really not bother you at all?

75
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:18,354
When Ji-yul and I…

76
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:21,149
It didn't bother me.

77
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:23,943
And there's nothing going on between us.

78
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:27,113
I was just happy to see him again

79
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:29,282
after so long.

80
00:07:30,241 --> 00:07:32,452
I do care about him a lot,

81
00:07:34,078 --> 00:07:37,498
but it's not the kind of feeling
that you have to worry about.

82
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:41,919
I'm sure that he feels the same way.

83
00:07:43,212 --> 00:07:45,256
Do you remember
when I asked for your help?

84
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:49,927
While I'm being rude,
let me say one more thing.

85
00:07:50,511 --> 00:07:52,680
If that's how you really feel,

86
00:07:52,763 --> 00:07:54,807
you should make it clear.

87
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:58,227
You may just be nice to everyone,

88
00:07:58,311 --> 00:08:00,688
but he might interpret it differently.

89
00:08:01,898 --> 00:08:04,442
You won't see him again
once he returns to Seoul.

90
00:08:05,067 --> 00:08:07,778
You don't necessarily have to
leave a good impression.

91
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:17,497
Come on. Eat before you go.

92
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:18,706
No, that's okay.

93
00:08:18,789 --> 00:08:20,708
It's at least a four-hour drive.

94
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:22,210
It'll be too late.

95
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:25,671
I can just grab a quick bite
at a rest area.

96
00:08:26,255 --> 00:08:30,760
I'm more disappointed that we never
got to record a video together.

97
00:08:31,928 --> 00:08:33,846
What am I going to tell our subscribers?

98
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:35,097
They'll be so disappointed.

99
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:38,351
Fine. Let's shoot one
when I get back to Seoul.

100
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:40,937
-I'll do it.
-You mean that, right?

101
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:42,605
-Really?
-Yes, I'll do it.

102
00:08:42,688 --> 00:08:43,856
-Promise?
-Yes.

103
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,024
As you should.

104
00:08:45,107 --> 00:08:47,735
You used my expensive labor for free.

105
00:08:50,613 --> 00:08:51,614
All right.

106
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:55,451
Hey. Make sure to appease Min
and send her back.

107
00:08:58,287 --> 00:09:00,498
Drive safely. Don't fall asleep.

108
00:09:00,581 --> 00:09:02,416
Okay. Keep me updated.

109
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:35,616
OFFICER AHN

110
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:48,671
Let's continue our talk tomorrow.

111
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:50,298
I'll come to the hospital.

112
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:25,416
HIS PEACH FARM

113
00:10:28,961 --> 00:10:32,131
Remember when you said
you would hear me out next time?

114
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:38,888
I was about to go into my house,

115
00:10:40,556 --> 00:10:44,477
but for a second, I thought,
"Should I go somewhere else?"

116
00:10:46,437 --> 00:10:48,022
I immediately thought of you.

117
00:10:49,273 --> 00:10:50,650
I thought I should come to you.

118
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:54,904
That thought popped into my head.

119
00:10:58,574 --> 00:11:00,868
And I realized we can't go on like this.

120
00:11:02,912 --> 00:11:05,706
Not giving you an answer

121
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:09,835
after you told me how you felt,

122
00:11:11,462 --> 00:11:13,047
yet still wanting to have

123
00:11:13,881 --> 00:11:15,841
what we've always had…

124
00:11:16,467 --> 00:11:17,927
That's just unfair.

125
00:11:19,762 --> 00:11:22,223
And it's so cowardly.

126
00:11:27,978 --> 00:11:32,650
I knew that giving you an answer
was the most considerate thing I could do,

127
00:11:32,733 --> 00:11:35,403
so I thought about it
over and over again, but…

128
00:11:39,573 --> 00:11:40,491
I'm sorry.

129
00:11:46,414 --> 00:11:47,748
The more I thought about it,

130
00:11:48,749 --> 00:11:50,709
the more I kept putting it off.

131
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:56,132
You've always greeted me with a smile,

132
00:11:56,841 --> 00:11:59,135
and you know me better than I know myself.

133
00:12:00,678 --> 00:12:02,054
But I was so scared

134
00:12:02,638 --> 00:12:04,348
that I might hurt you.

135
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:11,272
That things wouldn't be the same
between us anymore.

136
00:12:11,897 --> 00:12:14,900
And that I would regret my own decision.

137
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:21,824
Why are you crying
when I'm the one being rejected?

138
00:12:24,034 --> 00:12:25,703
Now I can't even cry.

139
00:12:32,042 --> 00:12:33,335
You still love me.

140
00:12:34,211 --> 00:12:35,087
Don't you?

141
00:12:42,553 --> 00:12:44,388
Even if we can't be lovers,

142
00:12:45,097 --> 00:12:46,390
I'm not going anywhere.

143
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:50,603
Even if it's not that kind of love,
you and I still love each other.

144
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:56,317
My feelings may hurt a little,
and things may not be the same between us.

145
00:12:57,943 --> 00:12:59,820
But I'll still be by your side.

146
00:13:01,655 --> 00:13:02,656
I told you before.

147
00:13:03,908 --> 00:13:06,869
To me, you're a lot of different things.

148
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:12,541
I'm the same too.
I'm here for you in many different ways.

149
00:13:13,584 --> 00:13:14,460
Also…

150
00:13:18,339 --> 00:13:20,633
whether or not I get hurt
is my burden to bear.

151
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:23,969
That is entirely for me to deal with.

152
00:13:27,348 --> 00:13:28,766
So let me deal with it.

153
00:13:34,104 --> 00:13:36,440
Don't be so nosy, okay?

154
00:13:37,024 --> 00:13:38,484
And don't regret this.

155
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:45,699
Although, I suppose

156
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:47,701
you might regret it.

157
00:13:49,411 --> 00:13:51,497
When I start liking some other girl.

158
00:15:19,668 --> 00:15:22,338
HAN DEOK-JIN VETERINARY HOSPITAL

159
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:38,520
You should go back now.

160
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:40,272
There's no point staying for a week.

161
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:42,650
You think you can make
a long-distance relationship

162
00:15:42,733 --> 00:15:43,567
work with her?

163
00:15:45,486 --> 00:15:47,446
We didn't break up

164
00:15:47,529 --> 00:15:50,240
because I didn't go with you
when you left for the States.

165
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:54,411
What you feel toward me
right now isn't love.

166
00:15:55,329 --> 00:15:57,331
It's just regret for what was

167
00:15:57,414 --> 00:15:59,667
and for what could have been.

168
00:16:02,086 --> 00:16:03,462
I loved you so much

169
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:05,547
that when we broke up,

170
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:07,800
I felt like
I'd never be able to love again.

171
00:16:12,763 --> 00:16:13,597
But…

172
00:16:14,515 --> 00:16:16,809
I think I can now.

173
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:20,229
It's not that I hate you

174
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:23,148
or that I'm denying
our good times together.

175
00:16:23,899 --> 00:16:26,694
I just have someone
that I want to be with again.

176
00:16:29,238 --> 00:16:32,157
Officer Ahn said
she didn't feel the same as you.

177
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:34,118
She said there's nothing between you two.

178
00:16:35,619 --> 00:16:36,453
Min.

179
00:16:37,705 --> 00:16:40,582
I'm talking about my feelings right now.

180
00:16:46,714 --> 00:16:47,756
I know.

181
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:50,884
That I'm being irrationally stubborn.

182
00:16:56,807 --> 00:16:58,475
I just missed the old you who was loving.

183
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:01,478
And I missed the old me

184
00:17:02,187 --> 00:17:03,480
who was happy with you.

185
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:07,693
I'm sorry.

186
00:17:08,318 --> 00:17:12,197
For making you choose
between coming with me and breaking up.

187
00:17:14,491 --> 00:17:17,536
And I'm sorry
that I took your love for granted.

188
00:17:20,831 --> 00:17:23,834
It's not like I never imagined
you'd fall for someone else.

189
00:17:24,793 --> 00:17:26,503
But it's a lot harder than I thought.

190
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:30,340
Give me some time to process it.

191
00:17:31,508 --> 00:17:32,509
I'll try to move on.

192
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:51,695
-Yes.
-Doctor.

193
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:54,281
Nurungji and Boksil's puppies
are here for vaccinations.

194
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,950
Okay, I'll be right there.

195
00:18:07,461 --> 00:18:09,129
-Oh, you're here.
-Hey.

196
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:15,010
-Hello.
-Hi.

197
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:18,806
Gang-hwa came down with a cold,

198
00:18:18,889 --> 00:18:21,016
and Ja-young was too busy, so we came.

199
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,518
I heard it can't be put off.

200
00:18:23,977 --> 00:18:25,270
Yes, that's right.

201
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:29,024
What's wrong? Are you disappointed
that Ja-young didn't come?

202
00:18:35,656 --> 00:18:38,283
My goodness. That's going to hurt.

203
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:45,499
It's done.
You'll grow up to be a healthy dog now.

204
00:18:45,582 --> 00:18:47,501
Oh, my. He is heavy.

205
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:49,670
-My goodness.
-It's all done.

206
00:18:50,337 --> 00:18:53,340
You can just leave them with me.

207
00:18:53,423 --> 00:18:56,343
Why? Are you going to
drop them off yourself?

208
00:18:57,010 --> 00:19:00,055
It's such a hassle,
so I already told Ja-young

209
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:02,474
that she should come pick them up.

210
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:04,518
But what can I do?
She says she's still busy.

211
00:19:06,061 --> 00:19:08,188
Anyway, we're leaving.
Yeong-suk, take care.

212
00:19:08,272 --> 00:19:09,439
All right, then.

213
00:19:09,523 --> 00:19:10,649
-Have a good one.
-Take care.

214
00:19:10,732 --> 00:19:11,692
Sure, bye.

215
00:19:11,775 --> 00:19:12,901
Bye.

216
00:19:16,196 --> 00:19:20,159
That pile of corn will attract bugs.
What should we do with it?

217
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:25,164
Hello.

218
00:19:25,247 --> 00:19:28,625
That corn keeps coming back here
like a boomerang.

219
00:19:29,543 --> 00:19:31,420
Where is Officer Ahn?

220
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:33,255
You just missed her.

221
00:19:33,964 --> 00:19:35,757
She must be feeling so energetic today.

222
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:38,302
She cleaned up the whole place
squeaky clean

223
00:19:38,385 --> 00:19:40,512
and then left
to handle some civil complaints.

224
00:19:40,596 --> 00:19:43,140
What kind of police officer
makes house calls?

225
00:19:43,223 --> 00:19:45,809
She went to check
Mr. Park's grass cutter, right?

226
00:19:45,893 --> 00:19:48,729
Yes, and the peach farm afterward.

227
00:19:48,812 --> 00:19:51,231
They're short-handed
in preparing for the festival.

228
00:19:51,315 --> 00:19:52,441
What he said.

229
00:19:52,524 --> 00:19:54,693
I understand. Have a good day.

230
00:19:54,776 --> 00:19:56,403
-Sure.
-Wait, would you like some of this?

231
00:19:56,486 --> 00:19:58,530
You look really tired.

232
00:20:00,073 --> 00:20:01,116
Keep them in your car

233
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,994
and have one when you feel dozy.
You'll feel wide awake.

234
00:20:05,913 --> 00:20:08,040
-Thank you.
-So? Do you feel more awake?

235
00:20:10,292 --> 00:20:12,044
-Yes.
-Have a nice day.

236
00:20:12,127 --> 00:20:13,879
-You too.
-Bye.

237
00:20:15,172 --> 00:20:16,048
What do you want?

238
00:20:16,131 --> 00:20:18,342
Is Officer Ahn here?

239
00:20:18,425 --> 00:20:19,468
She's not here.

240
00:20:27,434 --> 00:20:28,644
Do you have any siblings?

241
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:31,563
No, I don't.

242
00:20:32,314 --> 00:20:33,482
You're not sick somehow?

243
00:20:34,107 --> 00:20:36,401
No chronic illnesses
or hereditary conditions?

244
00:20:37,736 --> 00:20:39,154
Do you have some money saved?

245
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:40,280
Or real estate?

246
00:20:42,449 --> 00:20:45,410
Seeing how you're acting
like her big brother,

247
00:20:46,119 --> 00:20:47,579
she must have given you her answer.

248
00:20:47,663 --> 00:20:49,748
Seeing how you're looking
for her like that,

249
00:20:49,831 --> 00:20:52,167
you must be about to get yours.

250
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:54,628
Did she turn you down too?

251
00:20:57,005 --> 00:20:59,466
I'm not saying a thing.
You can hear it from her.

252
00:21:07,182 --> 00:21:09,851
Aren't you going to wait for her?
Help me until she comes.

253
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:11,812
Make yourself useful.

254
00:21:27,744 --> 00:21:30,497
A peach has a short stem,

255
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:33,041
so you have to wrap it
around the branch too.

256
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:34,835
See? Do you think you can do it?

257
00:21:42,634 --> 00:21:44,970
Gosh, what a sore sight.

258
00:21:46,179 --> 00:21:48,640
Did you hear that?
I meant for you to hear it.

259
00:21:50,475 --> 00:21:51,685
I don't have any children,

260
00:21:52,227 --> 00:21:54,146
but these peaches are like my babies.

261
00:21:55,022 --> 00:21:56,857
Could you not smile at them?

262
00:21:57,691 --> 00:21:59,234
It's making me uncomfortable.

263
00:22:07,784 --> 00:22:09,578
Be careful not to drop them!

264
00:22:09,661 --> 00:22:11,913
Don't you dare. I'll make you pay.

265
00:22:13,498 --> 00:22:14,333
Gosh.

266
00:22:18,545 --> 00:22:19,546
Hey.

267
00:22:22,382 --> 00:22:23,300
Hey.

268
00:22:26,762 --> 00:22:28,555
I'm going to throw this away first.

269
00:22:46,573 --> 00:22:48,992
-Let's talk.
-I have nothing to say to you.

270
00:22:49,534 --> 00:22:50,994
Man, why is it so hot today?

271
00:22:51,078 --> 00:22:53,705
But the weather's been good
for our crops, you know.

272
00:22:53,789 --> 00:22:55,624
Yes, that's what I've been hearing.

273
00:22:55,707 --> 00:22:57,584
-Yes. It's been great.
-My gosh.

274
00:22:57,667 --> 00:22:59,503
-Great for our peaches too.
-Goodness.

275
00:23:00,087 --> 00:23:02,798
-We're done. Let's go have some makgeolli.
-Sure.

276
00:23:02,881 --> 00:23:03,799
Yes, let's go.

277
00:23:03,882 --> 00:23:06,635
My goodness. Good work today.

278
00:23:09,054 --> 00:23:11,014
Why are we hiding?

279
00:23:14,017 --> 00:23:15,519
You keep avoiding me.

280
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,856
Why are you doing this?

281
00:23:20,607 --> 00:23:22,484
Just act like you always have.

282
00:23:22,567 --> 00:23:24,069
Stop trying to…

283
00:23:27,572 --> 00:23:31,368
Anyway, I have nothing to hear from you,
so let's not cause any misunderstanding.

284
00:23:31,451 --> 00:23:32,452
What misunderstanding?

285
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:34,412
And for whom?

286
00:23:34,496 --> 00:23:35,831
For everyone.

287
00:23:38,667 --> 00:23:39,751
You heard something…

288
00:23:41,002 --> 00:23:42,337
from Min, didn't you?

289
00:23:43,171 --> 00:23:45,132
-No, I didn't.
-Then why are you mad?

290
00:23:45,215 --> 00:23:46,466
Mad?

291
00:23:47,384 --> 00:23:48,301
I'm not.

292
00:23:49,052 --> 00:23:50,595
What would I be mad about?

293
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:57,602
I'm not curious
what you two did or will do.

294
00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:00,313
You hate it when people cross the line.

295
00:24:01,189 --> 00:24:03,984
You're crossing the line right now.
Do you know that?

296
00:24:05,026 --> 00:24:06,111
I haven't…

297
00:24:06,903 --> 00:24:08,029
crossed the line yet.

298
00:24:12,617 --> 00:24:13,451
I like you,

299
00:24:13,952 --> 00:24:14,786
Ahn Ja-young.

300
00:24:45,525 --> 00:24:46,818
You're just confused.

301
00:24:47,736 --> 00:24:51,948
You're just happy that you met
your childhood friend again.

302
00:24:52,032 --> 00:24:53,742
And we see a lot of each other, so…

303
00:24:53,825 --> 00:24:54,701
I'm not confused.

304
00:24:56,703 --> 00:24:57,871
Right now,

305
00:24:58,747 --> 00:25:00,749
I don't see the 12-year-old Ja-young.

306
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:04,836
I have feelings
for the 27-year-old Ja-young.

307
00:25:06,796 --> 00:25:07,631
I'm certain of it.

308
00:25:15,555 --> 00:25:18,892
I don't know what Min told you,

309
00:25:20,602 --> 00:25:21,519
but I'm sorry.

310
00:25:22,103 --> 00:25:23,897
For making you hear things
you didn't have to.

311
00:25:25,065 --> 00:25:26,441
I apologize on her behalf.

312
00:25:26,524 --> 00:25:28,401
-But I--
-To me, Han Ji-yul…

313
00:25:28,985 --> 00:25:29,945
is just a little boy.

314
00:25:30,946 --> 00:25:35,617
You're just a 13-year-old boy
who handed me a puppy and just left.

315
00:25:38,912 --> 00:25:40,330
I'm not doing this.

316
00:25:41,164 --> 00:25:42,582
I may be an idiot,

317
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,335
but I'm not falling for it twice.

318
00:26:24,082 --> 00:26:25,834
I like you, Ahn Ja-young.

319
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:33,508
Hey, Ja-young.

320
00:26:34,968 --> 00:26:35,927
Hi, Yeong-suk.

321
00:26:36,678 --> 00:26:39,431
-Are you on your way back from lunch?
-Yes, did you eat?

322
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:41,433
Well, kind of.

323
00:26:42,851 --> 00:26:45,020
What's with the parasol?

324
00:26:45,854 --> 00:26:49,149
Well, they say UV rays are
the main cause of aging skin.

325
00:26:49,232 --> 00:26:50,400
You should protect your skin.

326
00:26:50,483 --> 00:26:52,736
Or you'll look much older
after the summer.

327
00:26:52,819 --> 00:26:53,820
That's random.

328
00:26:57,115 --> 00:27:00,076
By the way, it looks like
Director Han will be returning sooner.

329
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:02,120
-What?
-They're about to travel freely

330
00:27:02,203 --> 00:27:03,788
now that the group tour is over,

331
00:27:03,872 --> 00:27:07,417
but his wife's worried about Little Doctor
and wants to come back sooner.

332
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:08,501
I can understand her.

333
00:27:08,585 --> 00:27:12,005
They basically forced their grandson
to come from Seoul and stay here.

334
00:27:12,088 --> 00:27:13,423
When are they coming back?

335
00:27:13,506 --> 00:27:15,216
I'm not so sure.

336
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:18,219
He said he was going to talk
to the Little Doctor,

337
00:27:18,303 --> 00:27:19,929
so I'm sure they'll discuss that.

338
00:27:20,555 --> 00:27:22,682
Wait. Maybe they already decided.

339
00:27:23,266 --> 00:27:25,560
A big suitcase was delivered
to the hospital earlier.

340
00:27:54,381 --> 00:27:55,465
Hey.

341
00:27:56,549 --> 00:27:57,592
Drink this.

342
00:27:58,760 --> 00:27:59,636
Man.

343
00:28:00,303 --> 00:28:02,097
Rejecting two men in one day…

344
00:28:03,181 --> 00:28:04,224
You're so popular.

345
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:09,813
Either way, you sorted it all out.

346
00:28:10,438 --> 00:28:12,774
You may feel bad,
but shouldn't you be more at ease?

347
00:28:14,192 --> 00:28:15,193
Why do you look like that?

348
00:28:17,737 --> 00:28:19,614
How do I look?

349
00:28:24,035 --> 00:28:26,538
Like you're nervous after telling a lie.

350
00:28:29,332 --> 00:28:31,292
It's nothing like that.

351
00:28:32,627 --> 00:28:34,546
As you told me before,

352
00:28:34,629 --> 00:28:38,007
he'll be gone soon,
so I shouldn't get attached to him.

353
00:28:40,635 --> 00:28:44,180
I'm sick of people
who just leave whenever they want to.

354
00:28:46,641 --> 00:28:48,601
You're scared he might leave.

355
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:52,731
Doesn't that mean
you don't want him to leave?

356
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:56,901
If that's not the case…

357
00:28:57,652 --> 00:29:02,115
You don't feel guilty or insecure
about Min, do you?

358
00:29:03,491 --> 00:29:05,493
That's not the Ahn Ja-young I know.

359
00:29:07,996 --> 00:29:09,622
If those are all just excuses,

360
00:29:10,457 --> 00:29:13,001
and you rejected Ji-yul
because you just don't like him…

361
00:29:14,836 --> 00:29:16,045
That's a win for me.

362
00:29:16,713 --> 00:29:20,216
Remember how we said we should
move in together when we turn 90?

363
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:02,967
I was waiting for you

364
00:30:03,051 --> 00:30:05,220
so I could pay for my stay
and see you before I leave.

365
00:30:06,387 --> 00:30:07,639
You're leaving?

366
00:30:12,185 --> 00:30:14,062
I guess I was overconfident.

367
00:30:14,854 --> 00:30:17,816
While I was dating Ji-yul
and even after we broke up,

368
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:21,444
I was confident that I could fix
whatever went wrong.

369
00:30:22,278 --> 00:30:25,198
But that was only because
Ji-yul gave me the assurance.

370
00:30:25,281 --> 00:30:27,075
I only realized that when I came here.

371
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:36,584
I'm sorry, Officer Ahn.

372
00:30:37,627 --> 00:30:40,213
I thought you were just a rebound,
but you're not.

373
00:30:41,005 --> 00:30:42,090
I was out of line.

374
00:30:49,681 --> 00:30:50,682
I also…

375
00:30:51,891 --> 00:30:52,934
have something to tell you.

376
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:56,020
I lied to you.

377
00:30:56,688 --> 00:30:58,523
When I said I wasn't bothered,

378
00:30:59,107 --> 00:30:59,983
I was lying.

379
00:31:01,234 --> 00:31:02,151
The truth is…

380
00:31:04,487 --> 00:31:05,488
I like him.

381
00:31:06,614 --> 00:31:07,907
I have feelings…

382
00:31:09,284 --> 00:31:10,451
for Ji-yul.

383
00:31:15,832 --> 00:31:16,958
I know.

384
00:31:17,584 --> 00:31:19,252
I knew it from the moment I saw you.

385
00:31:19,335 --> 00:31:20,753
Did you really think I didn't?

386
00:31:23,923 --> 00:31:27,635
If we hadn't met through Ji-yul,
I think we would have been great friends.

387
00:31:28,261 --> 00:31:29,095
It's a shame.

388
00:31:31,806 --> 00:31:32,682
But still,

389
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:34,893
let's never meet again.

390
00:31:36,352 --> 00:31:37,770
I'm going to move on.

391
00:33:02,939 --> 00:33:05,024
So when is it?

392
00:33:07,026 --> 00:33:08,528
What do you…

393
00:33:08,611 --> 00:33:10,488
When are you going back to Seoul?

394
00:33:14,158 --> 00:33:16,577
I guess you already heard.

395
00:33:18,204 --> 00:33:19,664
In about 15 days.

396
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:25,628
I know.

397
00:33:27,213 --> 00:33:29,632
Telling you how I feel
when I know I'm leaving soon…

398
00:33:30,466 --> 00:33:32,010
You must be confused.

399
00:33:34,512 --> 00:33:35,430
I deserve to be rejected.

400
00:33:37,015 --> 00:33:38,099
I know, but--

401
00:34:09,714 --> 00:34:11,674
It's so strange.

402
00:34:11,758 --> 00:34:12,925
What's with her?

403
00:34:13,009 --> 00:34:14,802
So you've decided to date him.

404
00:34:14,886 --> 00:34:16,054
I'll do better

405
00:34:16,137 --> 00:34:19,223
so that eight-hour round trips
feel like nothing.

406
00:34:19,307 --> 00:34:20,391
Doctor!

407
00:34:20,475 --> 00:34:22,643
It'll be such a headache
if others find out.

408
00:34:22,727 --> 00:34:24,729
See how risky it is to date openly?

409
00:34:24,812 --> 00:34:27,148
Han Ji-yul will be stressed out
from now on.

410
00:34:27,231 --> 00:34:29,734
Because I'll be giving him
a very hard time.

411
00:34:29,817 --> 00:34:31,944
-Weren't you expecting somebody?
-Well…

412
00:34:32,028 --> 00:34:34,739
Are we really going to be okay?
I'm so worried.

413
00:34:34,822 --> 00:34:39,243
