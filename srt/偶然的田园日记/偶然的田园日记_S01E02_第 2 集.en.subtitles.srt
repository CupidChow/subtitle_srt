1
00:00:46,254 --> 00:00:47,297
You can hear me, right?

2
00:00:47,839 --> 00:00:51,050
Huidong residents,
this is the head of your village.

3
00:00:51,134 --> 00:00:53,219
It's already sweltering hot this morning.

4
00:00:53,303 --> 00:00:54,888
Please beware of heatstroke.

5
00:00:57,223 --> 00:00:58,099
Yesterday,

6
00:00:58,183 --> 00:01:02,395
the grandson of Director Han
from Han Deok-jin Veterinary Hospital…

7
00:01:16,785 --> 00:01:17,619
You…

8
00:01:28,171 --> 00:01:30,715
If you see him around town,

9
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:32,801
please give him a warm welcome.

10
00:01:32,884 --> 00:01:34,469
I mean, you know…

11
00:01:35,053 --> 00:01:38,473
Give him a nice pat on the back
and that sort of thing.

12
00:01:38,556 --> 00:01:41,059
If you can do that,

13
00:01:41,142 --> 00:01:44,813
I believe that will make our village
a happier place.

14
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:48,775
I hope everyone will have
an exciting day today.

15
00:01:49,526 --> 00:01:51,110
I'M HAN JI-YUL. I'LL COME BACK.
LET'S BE SECRET FRIENDS AGAIN!

16
00:01:54,572 --> 00:01:57,575
You don't even remember me.
Secret friends, my foot.

17
00:01:58,535 --> 00:02:02,622
Or do you mean you'll keep it a secret
by not recognizing me?

18
00:02:02,705 --> 00:02:03,998
For those who didn't hear it--

19
00:02:04,082 --> 00:02:05,208
Honey!

20
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:08,002
-What? Why are you yelling?
-This is the third time already!

21
00:02:08,628 --> 00:02:10,255
Really? Well, then.

22
00:02:28,064 --> 00:02:29,524
Do I need to get a bed?

23
00:02:55,508 --> 00:02:56,926
Coffee…

24
00:02:59,512 --> 00:03:01,472
I doubt they have any.

25
00:03:03,308 --> 00:03:05,143
There's probably no gym either.

26
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:17,238
JI-YUL'S EXERCISE CLOTHES

27
00:03:27,248 --> 00:03:28,708
These are still here?

28
00:03:51,356 --> 00:03:52,315
Come on.

29
00:03:53,149 --> 00:03:55,401
I told him to just wear them,
not to save them.

30
00:04:09,874 --> 00:04:12,085
Isn't that Director Han's grandson?

31
00:04:12,168 --> 00:04:13,378
Yes, that's him.

32
00:04:13,461 --> 00:04:14,712
You're him, right?

33
00:04:14,796 --> 00:04:17,173
What a fair complexion.
You're indeed from Seoul.

34
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:18,841
You look just like him.

35
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:20,677
Anyway, welcome to the village.

36
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,345
Come over here, quickly.

37
00:04:22,428 --> 00:04:25,265
This is Director Han's grandson
from Seoul.

38
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:27,976
-You're so handsome.
-My gosh, you are so dashing!

39
00:04:28,059 --> 00:04:30,520
-You're so good-looking.
-Do you have a girlfriend?

40
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:32,897
-Let me set you up.
-How long are you staying here?

41
00:04:32,981 --> 00:04:34,732
I hope you'll stay a while.

42
00:04:34,816 --> 00:04:36,067
My goodness, he's so young.

43
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:37,443
He's as handsome as they said he was.

44
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:39,237
He's from Seoul like his grandfather.

45
00:04:57,255 --> 00:04:59,841
Why are you hitting that innocent wall?

46
00:05:00,383 --> 00:05:03,594
What did it ever do to you?

47
00:05:03,678 --> 00:05:06,723
Are you looking down on our village
because it's old?

48
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:08,599
Why are you taking it out on the rock?

49
00:05:08,683 --> 00:05:11,769
Our president is fuming
from the fight she just had.

50
00:05:11,853 --> 00:05:14,480
So don't mind her and be on your way.

51
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:17,400
Darn it! I'm so mad.

52
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:20,403
"An old village teeming with old people"?

53
00:05:20,486 --> 00:05:24,157
Damn it! Just because you have a college,
you think your town is younger?

54
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,533
All right, Park Mal-geum

55
00:05:25,616 --> 00:05:28,161
of the Majeong Women's Association.
Let's see about that.

56
00:05:28,244 --> 00:05:29,787
Let's go all the way!

57
00:05:29,871 --> 00:05:33,541
We'd beat them in a one-on-one fight.
Aren't I right?

58
00:05:33,624 --> 00:05:34,500
Of course.

59
00:05:35,126 --> 00:05:37,045
Put that down. It's heavy.

60
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:53,478
Little morning workout?

61
00:05:53,561 --> 00:05:55,229
-Yes.
-Okay.

62
00:05:56,314 --> 00:05:59,692
So tell me, doctor.
Are you on our side or their side?

63
00:06:02,487 --> 00:06:03,362
Pardon?

64
00:06:04,238 --> 00:06:07,867
Are you related in any way
to anyone from Majeong?

65
00:06:11,662 --> 00:06:12,497
Majeong?

66
00:06:18,544 --> 00:06:19,629
You're on our side.

67
00:06:22,256 --> 00:06:23,549
Well, I'm not really…

68
00:06:23,633 --> 00:06:25,134
Your grandparents live here.

69
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:29,180
You do your morning exercise here.
So you belong here, am I right?

70
00:06:30,848 --> 00:06:33,768
I should gather
the Young Men's Association right away

71
00:06:33,851 --> 00:06:37,647
to show them what the young blood
of Huidong can do.

72
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:39,065
Right? Good.

73
00:06:40,149 --> 00:06:41,776
Go on, keep jogging.

74
00:06:42,527 --> 00:06:44,654
And don't beat up any more walls.

75
00:06:44,737 --> 00:06:46,155
-You're one of us.
-One of us.

76
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:48,991
-Let's go.
-Sure.

77
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:57,625
Do you want some potatoes?

78
00:07:20,231 --> 00:07:21,732
Who are you?

79
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:24,026
Hello.

80
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:27,947
I'm Kim Seon-dong, a second grader
at Huidong Elementary School.

81
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:29,240
I live across from you.

82
00:07:33,369 --> 00:07:35,413
My ball went over the wall.

83
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:38,416
-Well, have a good day.
-Hey, wait.

84
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,710
Did you come in through the gate?

85
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:43,504
I remember locking it earlier.
How did you get in?

86
00:07:43,588 --> 00:07:46,799
I just put my hand through the gap
and slide the latch.

87
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:53,639
-What was your name again?
-Kim Seon-dong.

88
00:07:53,723 --> 00:07:55,224
All right, Seon-dong.

89
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:57,226
In my opinion,

90
00:07:57,894 --> 00:08:01,939
there are better ways,
like ringing the doorbell or knocking.

91
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:05,234
Why did you open the gate
and let yourself in?

92
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:09,655
Seon-dong.

93
00:08:14,577 --> 00:08:17,413
There you are.
Did the ball go over the wall again?

94
00:08:18,372 --> 00:08:21,209
-You found it, so let's go.
-Wait.

95
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:25,838
Seon-dong. Since you live across from me

96
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:28,382
and this might happen often,
I should say this.

97
00:08:28,466 --> 00:08:32,094
If your ball goes over the wall again,
ring the bell or knock on the gate.

98
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:33,804
Then I'll get you the ball.

99
00:08:33,888 --> 00:08:37,391
Walking into someone's house
just because you know how to

100
00:08:37,475 --> 00:08:40,561
can be much more dangerous than you think.

101
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:41,646
Okay?

102
00:08:47,777 --> 00:08:49,820
No, I'm not scolding you.

103
00:08:49,904 --> 00:08:52,031
Are you taking it out on a kid?

104
00:08:52,615 --> 00:08:53,616
It's not like that…

105
00:08:54,575 --> 00:08:57,954
You can play with the ball around here
once Director Han comes back home.

106
00:08:58,704 --> 00:09:00,456
Kim Seon-dong, say goodbye to him.

107
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,708
I have committed a grave sin.

108
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:04,168
Have a good day.

109
00:09:04,252 --> 00:09:05,127
Well done.

110
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:07,797
Hey…

111
00:09:09,674 --> 00:09:13,427
My grandma said it takes skill
to say the right thing and sound so mean.

112
00:09:13,511 --> 00:09:15,888
That man sure has that skill.

113
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:19,725
You're right. He's very skilled.

114
00:09:23,187 --> 00:09:25,648
And he's not as handsome
as people have been saying.

115
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:27,858
-And his style is wack.
-I told you.

116
00:09:27,942 --> 00:09:30,528
He just has two eyes, a nose, and a mouth.

117
00:09:31,612 --> 00:09:32,947
You said that? When?

118
00:09:34,031 --> 00:09:35,283
Let's go.

119
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:10,484
HAN DEOK-JIN VETERINARY HOSPITAL

120
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:42,224
Did you have a good night?

121
00:10:46,854 --> 00:10:48,981
Come on, it's not time to open yet.

122
00:10:49,732 --> 00:10:51,400
Diligence must run in your family.

123
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:55,071
Being too diligent
can tire out your coworkers.

124
00:10:56,238 --> 00:10:59,033
I came in early because it's my first day.
Take your time.

125
00:10:59,116 --> 00:11:01,118
I couldn't take my time if I wanted to.

126
00:11:01,702 --> 00:11:05,164
Mr. Yang has been calling non-stop
since a while ago.

127
00:11:06,582 --> 00:11:08,876
Is there a scheduled appointment today?

128
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:10,795
Give me a second.

129
00:11:10,878 --> 00:11:13,464
We can't start a day without
a quick cup of morning coffee.

130
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:20,513
Coffee is something
you drink in a classy manner.

131
00:11:24,475 --> 00:11:27,895
Is this the only coffee you have here?

132
00:11:27,978 --> 00:11:30,523
Are you worried we'll run out?

133
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:32,650
Have a look over there.

134
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:37,279
I've never let it run out
since I started working here.

135
00:11:41,325 --> 00:11:43,244
Maybe I should get a coffee machine first.

136
00:11:43,327 --> 00:11:44,662
-Sorry?
-What?

137
00:11:46,705 --> 00:11:48,124
No, it's nothing.

138
00:11:48,624 --> 00:11:51,001
So what was the appointment
that you mentioned?

139
00:11:51,085 --> 00:11:52,670
Yes, by the afternoon.

140
00:11:52,753 --> 00:11:54,713
PIG VACCINATION
MR. YANG'S

141
00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:21,282
Hey, how are you?

142
00:12:21,365 --> 00:12:23,409
The vaccination is today, right?

143
00:12:23,492 --> 00:12:26,036
Come on, how could I forget?

144
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,496
I remember,

145
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:31,542
but you do know Director Han's grandson
is coming this time, right?

146
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:35,296
He's a young man,
so I figured that you might not need me.

147
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:39,049
Yes, there are a lot of pigs.

148
00:12:39,842 --> 00:12:43,471
Right. Treating pigs is not the same
as treating dogs.

149
00:12:43,554 --> 00:12:47,475
But he'll be fine on his own.
Do you really need me there too?

150
00:12:47,558 --> 00:12:52,438
Is she saying she's going or not?

151
00:12:52,521 --> 00:12:54,148
Well, okay.

152
00:12:54,231 --> 00:12:55,566
-I'm not sure.
-Okay.

153
00:13:00,321 --> 00:13:02,323
-Do you want me to go?
-What?

154
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:06,118
No, it's okay. I should go.

155
00:13:07,328 --> 00:13:09,497
I'll be at Mr. Yang's.

156
00:13:10,915 --> 00:13:12,917
I'll get you some coffee on the way back.

157
00:13:14,251 --> 00:13:18,130
Mother pigs should be vaccinated
three or four weeks before giving birth,

158
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:22,593
and female piglets, two months after birth
and four weeks after that.

159
00:13:22,676 --> 00:13:25,137
As for uncastrated male pigs…

160
00:13:26,096 --> 00:13:26,972
Hello?

161
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:30,559
Hey, are you okay?

162
00:13:31,185 --> 00:13:32,811
How could I be okay?

163
00:13:33,812 --> 00:13:36,023
The last time I studied large animals
was in college.

164
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:39,735
No wonder the cargo rack
on this thing is so big.

165
00:13:40,903 --> 00:13:43,989
The owner probably separated
the ones that need to be vaccinated.

166
00:13:44,073 --> 00:13:47,409
As for the vaccination itself,
you're familiar with the process.

167
00:13:48,452 --> 00:13:51,956
You can learn as you go,
so just try to make it through the day.

168
00:13:52,039 --> 00:13:53,707
It's easy for you to say, isn't it?

169
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:56,043
Yes, it really is. Later.

170
00:13:56,627 --> 00:13:58,003
Seriously.

171
00:14:04,051 --> 00:14:07,471
My goodness,
you look just like your grandfather.

172
00:14:07,555 --> 00:14:09,807
It's uncanny, my goodness.

173
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:11,475
Wasn't it hard to come here?

174
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:12,434
No, I'm fine.

175
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:14,353
You've come a long way, indeed.

176
00:14:14,436 --> 00:14:16,480
I heard a lot about you
from your grandfather.

177
00:14:17,064 --> 00:14:20,067
You're so tall and handsome.

178
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:23,279
Your grandfather must be very proud.

179
00:14:24,071 --> 00:14:26,907
These ones here and over there
are getting vaccinated today.

180
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:30,703
It's not that many, right?

181
00:14:32,746 --> 00:14:33,831
Gosh, you scared me.

182
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:40,296
You two haven't been introduced, right?

183
00:14:42,506 --> 00:14:44,925
This is the vet from Seoul.

184
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:46,802
This is our Officer Ahn.

185
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:49,889
She always helps out with the vaccination.

186
00:14:49,972 --> 00:14:53,267
I have a lot of pigs,
so it takes all day to do it by myself.

187
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:54,560
Which is why I called.

188
00:14:56,312 --> 00:14:57,813
I'm not even surprised anymore.

189
00:14:57,897 --> 00:15:00,232
Does vaccinating animals fall
under police duties?

190
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:02,109
She isn't just any police officer.

191
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:04,987
-Are you ready?
-Of course.

192
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:06,155
Okay.

193
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:08,449
Alright, let's get this over with.

194
00:15:23,797 --> 00:15:26,258
You haven't forgotten
how to give them shots, have you?

195
00:15:29,219 --> 00:15:32,264
I'm not exactly the type to forget things.

196
00:15:32,348 --> 00:15:34,558
Besides, it's such a basic vaccination.

197
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:36,393
Is that right?

198
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:42,274
I haven't done large animal vaccinations
since my college lab sessions,

199
00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:44,568
so I'm just trying to be extra cautious…

200
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:50,407
Why am I even explaining this
to a non-professional like you?

201
00:15:50,491 --> 00:15:51,825
I know, right?

202
00:15:54,203 --> 00:15:56,497
Didn't you apologize to me yesterday?

203
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:58,582
Did I?

204
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:03,087
No matter how I think about it,
I don't think I've done anything wrong.

205
00:16:03,754 --> 00:16:05,631
And I doubt this is the case either,

206
00:16:06,256 --> 00:16:08,592
but did you get conned by someone
who looked like me?

207
00:16:08,676 --> 00:16:10,302
I mean, since yesterday--

208
00:16:10,386 --> 00:16:11,512
-Yes!
-Say what?

209
00:16:11,595 --> 00:16:14,556
I did get conned by someone
who looked like this.

210
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:17,393
But that person seems
to have forgotten about it.

211
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:21,897
We have a lot of pigs here.

212
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:25,484
I, a non-professional,
will fill up the syringes

213
00:16:25,567 --> 00:16:28,696
and you, a professional,
can administer the shots.

214
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:29,863
Let's get it over with.

215
00:16:35,035 --> 00:16:36,745
Let's go, guys.

216
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:38,789
-What the heck are you doing? Hurry!
-No.

217
00:16:38,872 --> 00:16:39,915
-No, this way!
-What…

218
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:42,084
Hey, wait! Here!

219
00:16:43,293 --> 00:16:45,254
-Come on.
-Over here.

220
00:16:45,879 --> 00:16:47,381
Let's go.

221
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:49,341
No.

222
00:16:49,425 --> 00:16:52,052
Let's go. Go back.

223
00:16:53,762 --> 00:16:55,347
There you go.

224
00:16:55,431 --> 00:16:56,932
There you go. Good job.

225
00:16:59,476 --> 00:17:00,728
Give this one a shot.

226
00:17:04,314 --> 00:17:06,150
Over the fence like this? Here we go.

227
00:17:11,405 --> 00:17:13,407
-Well done.
-This one too.

228
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:21,498
Hold still.

229
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:23,500
Good job.

230
00:17:34,636 --> 00:17:35,971
-Right here!
-Okay.

231
00:17:36,847 --> 00:17:37,765
There you go.

232
00:17:39,516 --> 00:17:40,893
Oh, boy.

233
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:02,498
Oh, my goodness. What a disaster.

234
00:18:02,581 --> 00:18:05,000
I told you to watch out for the poop,
weren't you listening?

235
00:18:07,503 --> 00:18:08,545
It wasn't the poop.

236
00:18:09,379 --> 00:18:11,298
I should have been watching out
for something else.

237
00:18:11,381 --> 00:18:12,674
You're not hurt, are you?

238
00:18:13,842 --> 00:18:15,886
You're still standing,
so you must be okay.

239
00:18:15,969 --> 00:18:19,973
This stable work requires
a lot of muscle power.

240
00:18:20,057 --> 00:18:22,851
I get that you're from the city,
but you're too weak.

241
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:24,269
A man's got to be strong.

242
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:28,398
No. Wait a minute.
I'll get you some new gloves.

243
00:18:28,982 --> 00:18:29,942
Jeez.

244
00:18:36,323 --> 00:18:39,868
I know how to do a break-fall.
You didn't have to catch me.

245
00:18:42,996 --> 00:18:44,456
I'm sorry.

246
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:46,917
I was startled
when you suddenly grabbed me.

247
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,794
It's kind of an occupational habit.

248
00:18:51,338 --> 00:18:53,966
Where did those darn pigs go?

249
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:01,056
Shall we start with this one?

250
00:19:03,892 --> 00:19:05,519
Oh, my.

251
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:15,612
I'll take those.

252
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:24,288
Thank you so much for your hard work.

253
00:19:24,371 --> 00:19:25,789
Drink up, both of you.

254
00:19:25,873 --> 00:19:27,499
Thank you.

255
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:29,126
The gratitude is all mine.

256
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:31,545
Do you want some nice, cold coffee?

257
00:19:31,628 --> 00:19:34,464
No, I'm okay.
I'm going to go get some now.

258
00:19:34,548 --> 00:19:36,842
I see. You're going to the café?

259
00:19:36,925 --> 00:19:37,759
Yes.

260
00:19:39,261 --> 00:19:40,971
I'll be going now.

261
00:19:41,054 --> 00:19:42,472
Call me if you need me again.

262
00:19:42,556 --> 00:19:44,600
Thank you as always.

263
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:46,643
-See you.
-Okay.

264
00:19:47,811 --> 00:19:50,564
What about you, doctor?
Would you like some coffee?

265
00:19:50,647 --> 00:19:52,149
I'm okay.

266
00:19:52,232 --> 00:19:53,483
-Thank you.
-I see.

267
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:57,821
Wait.

268
00:20:43,283 --> 00:20:45,452
What would you like to have?

269
00:20:49,164 --> 00:20:51,875
-I'll have an espresso.
-Okay.

270
00:21:04,054 --> 00:21:05,889
-Hey.
-Hi.

271
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:13,480
You're the vet from Seoul, right?

272
00:21:13,563 --> 00:21:14,898
Director Han's grandson.

273
00:21:14,982 --> 00:21:16,483
Right, I am.

274
00:21:16,566 --> 00:21:18,402
I'm in charge of
Huidong Young Men's Association

275
00:21:18,485 --> 00:21:20,320
as well as the peach business.

276
00:21:20,404 --> 00:21:21,738
I'm Lee Sang-hyeon.

277
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:25,867
-I'm Han Ji-yul.
-Nice to meet you.

278
00:21:26,827 --> 00:21:29,788
I saw you briefly yesterday too.
You were in the police car.

279
00:21:35,335 --> 00:21:36,628
Here's your coffee.

280
00:21:44,344 --> 00:21:45,595
HIS PEACH FARM

281
00:21:46,638 --> 00:21:47,889
That's me.

282
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:52,602
Hey, come take a look at this.

283
00:21:59,234 --> 00:22:00,694
If you just got here yesterday,

284
00:22:00,777 --> 00:22:03,655
she must be the person
you've seen the most, right?

285
00:22:05,282 --> 00:22:06,950
Yes, I guess.

286
00:22:09,202 --> 00:22:11,496
Can I tell you something scary?

287
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:18,754
That face will be the one
you see most often while you're here.

288
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:21,923
That's not good.

289
00:22:22,507 --> 00:22:24,551
She doesn't seem to like my face too much.

290
00:22:25,427 --> 00:22:26,470
Really?

291
00:22:26,553 --> 00:22:28,972
Hey, when did you say this was robbed?

292
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:33,935
I saw it in there last night,
but it was gone this morning.

293
00:22:35,479 --> 00:22:37,689
They knew the money was here

294
00:22:37,773 --> 00:22:41,109
and they knew there was a padlock on it,
so they must have brought tools.

295
00:22:42,402 --> 00:22:44,362
That means it must have been a local.

296
00:22:45,072 --> 00:22:47,741
It makes no sense.
There's really a thief in this town?

297
00:22:48,366 --> 00:22:50,243
There are only old people here.

298
00:22:50,952 --> 00:22:52,162
That's what I'm saying.

299
00:22:52,913 --> 00:22:54,623
Do you know how much was in here?

300
00:22:55,373 --> 00:22:57,876
When I checked yesterday,
it was around 30,000 won.

301
00:22:58,502 --> 00:23:00,754
I didn't get an exact count,

302
00:23:00,837 --> 00:23:02,255
but it was around that much.

303
00:23:03,256 --> 00:23:05,300
Don't you think it's too little to steal?

304
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:12,307
I heard you were suspected of this
as soon as you arrived here.

305
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:16,978
-Yes.
-Gosh, you're such a hothead.

306
00:23:17,062 --> 00:23:19,856
Hey, does he really look like
a petty thief to you?

307
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:24,694
I mean, it's not like thieves wear signs
that say "I'm a thief."

308
00:23:25,195 --> 00:23:26,655
I had probable cause.

309
00:23:27,614 --> 00:23:31,368
It's okay. She's apologized enough.

310
00:23:32,035 --> 00:23:35,580
She also made it very clear
that she doesn't like my face.

311
00:23:40,961 --> 00:23:43,713
You klutz. Let me see.

312
00:23:49,636 --> 00:23:51,221
-Let me borrow your credit card.
-What?

313
00:23:54,141 --> 00:23:55,350
No, it hurts!

314
00:24:02,899 --> 00:24:03,775
Are you crazy?

315
00:24:03,859 --> 00:24:05,902
My bad, I thought it was
my hand for a second.

316
00:24:05,986 --> 00:24:07,904
What's wrong with you? That's so gross.

317
00:24:07,988 --> 00:24:10,157
What do you mean, gross? It's sterilizing.

318
00:24:15,829 --> 00:24:16,705
Thank you.

319
00:24:16,788 --> 00:24:18,999
Please use that to pay for the coffee.

320
00:24:19,082 --> 00:24:22,252
This is just a space made
for our village folks to just swing by

321
00:24:22,335 --> 00:24:24,880
and enjoy some beverages,
so there's no card reader.

322
00:24:24,963 --> 00:24:27,382
I'm from out of town, so I'll pay.

323
00:24:31,845 --> 00:24:33,263
You really don't have to.

324
00:24:36,266 --> 00:24:38,101
You don't know your way
around here yet, do you?

325
00:24:38,185 --> 00:24:39,436
If you need a guide…

326
00:24:41,438 --> 00:24:42,564
It's okay.

327
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:46,109
Would you like some peaches then?

328
00:24:46,193 --> 00:24:49,029
-They're super sweet--
-It's okay.

329
00:24:50,488 --> 00:24:51,573
Have a good day.

330
00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:02,959
Wow, he sure knows how to draw a line.

331
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:05,253
Is he mad at me for taking his card?

332
00:25:06,588 --> 00:25:09,382
I think he's just like that.

333
00:25:09,466 --> 00:25:11,509
So he doesn't like country folks.

334
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:15,513
He's kind of a jerk, but whatever.
He won't be here long.

335
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:21,394
-Do you want some coffee?
-Sure.

336
00:25:30,445 --> 00:25:32,656
"His Peach Farm."

337
00:25:35,283 --> 00:25:36,576
Is it that good?

338
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:40,330
I wouldn't know because I only drink
instant coffee, but I hear it's tasty.

339
00:25:40,413 --> 00:25:42,624
Even people from other villages
come to buy some.

340
00:25:46,127 --> 00:25:47,879
I wonder where the beans are from.

341
00:25:47,963 --> 00:25:50,423
I don't know where the beans come from,

342
00:25:50,507 --> 00:25:53,760
but Sang-hyeon roasts them himself.
Our Young Men's Association president.

343
00:25:53,843 --> 00:25:56,304
You must have met him there.

344
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:57,931
Ja-young's class partner.

345
00:25:58,014 --> 00:26:00,892
There's really nothing he can't do.

346
00:26:00,976 --> 00:26:03,144
He looks like a good guy, doesn't he?

347
00:26:04,479 --> 00:26:05,355
Yes.

348
00:26:06,439 --> 00:26:11,861
Speaking of which,
don't I look like a good person too?

349
00:26:12,445 --> 00:26:15,740
Do I look like I'd con someone
and not even remember?

350
00:26:15,824 --> 00:26:20,412
Why? Did someone say
you look like a scumbag?

351
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:22,539
Not exactly, but…

352
00:26:27,002 --> 00:26:29,671
By the way, what's the deal
with that Officer Ahn?

353
00:26:29,754 --> 00:26:31,840
She seems to be everywhere.

354
00:26:32,424 --> 00:26:34,592
Our Ja-young?

355
00:26:34,676 --> 00:26:37,512
Officially, she is a police officer,

356
00:26:37,595 --> 00:26:41,683
but she's pretty much
a human civil complaint window.

357
00:26:41,766 --> 00:26:45,895
She was born and raised in this town,
so she's fiercely loyal to her hometown.

358
00:26:45,979 --> 00:26:50,025
It's not easy to find
young people like her these days.

359
00:26:51,526 --> 00:26:53,194
She should be a politician.

360
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:54,988
So she's extraordinarily nosy?

361
00:26:56,906 --> 00:27:00,493
When you put it like that,
it gives a very different nuance.

362
00:27:00,577 --> 00:27:02,662
She's a warm-hearted person

363
00:27:02,746 --> 00:27:05,248
-who generously offers what she has…
-Exactly.

364
00:27:06,791 --> 00:27:09,502
She's nosy.

365
00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:11,963
Is everyone in Seoul like you?

366
00:27:16,718 --> 00:27:17,552
Hello?

367
00:27:18,511 --> 00:27:20,138
Okay. I got it.

368
00:27:21,348 --> 00:27:22,307
You'd better go.

369
00:27:23,892 --> 00:27:25,101
But it's lunchtime.

370
00:27:25,185 --> 00:27:28,605
What kind of country vet takes
a regular lunch break?

371
00:27:28,688 --> 00:27:31,900
There's a baby goat
throwing a tantrum over colic.

372
00:27:33,568 --> 00:27:34,819
Move it!

373
00:27:47,207 --> 00:27:49,292
Some work environment.

374
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:51,753
I better buy a truck first.

375
00:28:00,136 --> 00:28:03,807
So you didn't even see their face?
Not even a little bit?

376
00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:04,766
No.

377
00:28:05,308 --> 00:28:09,729
I just saw a tall silhouette running away.

378
00:28:11,523 --> 00:28:13,066
Someone who's tall…

379
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:17,362
What about the hair?
Was it long or short? What was the color?

380
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:20,907
I don't know the color.

381
00:28:21,825 --> 00:28:24,244
He was wearing a red bean-colored hat.

382
00:28:24,828 --> 00:28:27,288
It didn't look like his hair was long.

383
00:28:30,291 --> 00:28:34,045
My grandson worked part-time
to save up that money.

384
00:28:34,129 --> 00:28:37,215
And he gave it to me as pocket money.

385
00:28:37,298 --> 00:28:41,219
My goodness. What do I do?

386
00:28:42,846 --> 00:28:45,682
Officer Ahn,
please catch him for me, okay?

387
00:28:45,765 --> 00:28:49,811
Don't worry, ma'am.
I promise I'll catch the thief.

388
00:29:27,307 --> 00:29:28,141
Officer Ahn.

389
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:32,061
Did the old lady get home safely?

390
00:29:32,145 --> 00:29:32,979
Yes.

391
00:29:33,062 --> 00:29:34,481
And she didn't go to the field?

392
00:29:34,564 --> 00:29:35,732
I made sure she didn't.

393
00:29:36,483 --> 00:29:38,693
I think she's trying
to recoup the stolen money.

394
00:29:39,444 --> 00:29:40,737
Who could it be?

395
00:29:41,488 --> 00:29:42,906
Considering the amount,

396
00:29:42,989 --> 00:29:45,033
the culprit has to be a kid.

397
00:29:45,116 --> 00:29:46,242
Exactly.

398
00:29:46,326 --> 00:29:49,412
But there aren't many school kids
who know this village that well.

399
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:52,165
Right. Red bean-colored hat.

400
00:29:54,834 --> 00:29:56,169
-Sergeant Yoon.
-Yes?

401
00:29:56,252 --> 00:29:58,880
Head back without me.
I'll look around a little more.

402
00:29:58,963 --> 00:30:00,965
-Will you? Okay.
-Yes.

403
00:30:01,049 --> 00:30:02,467
-Have a good day.
-You too.

404
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:07,764
Ja-young!

405
00:30:08,556 --> 00:30:09,766
Ja-young!

406
00:30:09,849 --> 00:30:10,975
Come on, hurry!

407
00:30:11,059 --> 00:30:12,811
-Seon-dong.
-Hurry up!

408
00:30:13,478 --> 00:30:15,814
-What?
-Come on.

409
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:24,531
Hey, come here.

410
00:30:25,907 --> 00:30:28,535
Ja-young, did I see a burglar?

411
00:30:28,618 --> 00:30:30,161
I'm scared.

412
00:30:33,331 --> 00:30:35,542
I'm right here.
There's nothing to be scared of.

413
00:30:36,292 --> 00:30:39,003
Thanks to you,
we're going to catch a bad guy.

414
00:30:39,087 --> 00:30:42,382
-Well done.
-But I'm scared.

415
00:30:42,966 --> 00:30:45,718
Wait. You're having fun right now,
aren't you?

416
00:30:45,802 --> 00:30:47,220
You can't.

417
00:30:47,303 --> 00:30:49,097
Are you going in alone?

418
00:30:49,931 --> 00:30:51,474
Uncle Geun-mo will be here soon.

419
00:30:51,558 --> 00:30:53,601
So don't worry, and wait at home.

420
00:30:55,019 --> 00:30:56,062
Go on, now!

421
00:30:56,145 --> 00:30:57,438
Come on, get up.

422
00:30:59,274 --> 00:31:00,483
Don't get hurt.

423
00:31:00,567 --> 00:31:01,901
Of course not. Now go.

424
00:31:02,527 --> 00:31:03,486
Go.

425
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:06,197
Go.

426
00:31:24,674 --> 00:31:26,092
It's you this time?

427
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:29,679
Does everyone just come and go
through this house as they please

428
00:31:29,762 --> 00:31:31,890
as long as their arms are thin enough?

429
00:31:31,973 --> 00:31:33,266
No, it's not that…

430
00:31:33,349 --> 00:31:35,643
I told you if anything went
over the wall, I'd get it--

431
00:32:05,173 --> 00:32:06,174
Who are you?

432
00:32:30,156 --> 00:32:32,408
Is this him? Get up!

433
00:32:38,998 --> 00:32:39,832
You're…

434
00:32:40,416 --> 00:32:41,501
Ju-ho's friend, right?

435
00:32:42,335 --> 00:32:45,505
I'll take him outside first.
Get up. Let's go.

436
00:32:56,849 --> 00:32:57,725
Are you all right?

437
00:33:04,482 --> 00:33:05,566
I've learned my lesson.

438
00:33:07,026 --> 00:33:08,569
I'm not taking your hand.

439
00:33:21,749 --> 00:33:23,292
I guess you haven't learned.

440
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:25,378
I agree.

441
00:33:49,152 --> 00:33:51,446
Why do you hate this village so much?

442
00:33:51,529 --> 00:33:53,197
I never said I hated it.

443
00:33:53,781 --> 00:33:55,783
But come to think of it, I do hate it.

444
00:33:55,867 --> 00:33:56,784
Have a good one.

445
00:33:57,702 --> 00:33:59,537
Do you remember? My secret friend.

446
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:00,872
You mean that vet?

447
00:34:00,955 --> 00:34:02,623
He doesn't even recognize me.

448
00:34:02,707 --> 00:34:04,208
I remember everything.

449
00:34:05,043 --> 00:34:07,545
-We are that close.
-Hey.

450
00:34:07,628 --> 00:34:11,215
Someone who keeps bothering you
and makes you think about them, you know?

451
00:34:11,299 --> 00:34:14,469
If he doesn't feel anything
looking at a girl like Ja-young,

452
00:34:14,552 --> 00:34:17,055
he's not really a man, is he?

453
00:34:17,138 --> 00:34:20,683
