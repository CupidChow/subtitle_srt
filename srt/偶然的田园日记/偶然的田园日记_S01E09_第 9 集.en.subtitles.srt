1
00:00:44,335 --> 00:00:45,545
She's not my girlfriend.

2
00:00:46,337 --> 00:00:47,922
-What?
-I don't have

3
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:49,674
a girlfriend.

4
00:00:55,972 --> 00:00:59,309
You came here to tell me that?

5
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:00,727
What?

6
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:09,152
I mean,

7
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:11,613
not really.

8
00:01:12,697 --> 00:01:15,742
I was just taking a walk.
I guess we happened to cross paths.

9
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:22,248
I could have told you later,
but we ran into each other, so…

10
00:01:24,834 --> 00:01:25,835
Well, then.

11
00:01:28,421 --> 00:01:29,506
Then who is she?

12
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:33,301
The woman staying at her house.

13
00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:35,595
She didn't look like a friend.

14
00:01:40,683 --> 00:01:42,060
She's my ex-girlfriend.

15
00:01:43,269 --> 00:01:45,313
But she doesn't seem to think so.

16
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:51,069
Go ahead and continue your walk.
We were in the middle of a talk as well.

17
00:01:51,611 --> 00:01:54,781
Right. Nurungji's puppies need to be
vaccinated soon.

18
00:01:54,864 --> 00:01:56,866
I was actually going
to tell Auntie Gang-hwa

19
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:59,911
to stop by the hospital
sometime this week.

20
00:01:59,994 --> 00:02:02,330
If you're not busy,
bring Nurungji that day too.

21
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:04,833
He would love to see his puppies.

22
00:02:06,709 --> 00:02:07,544
So insistent…

23
00:02:08,336 --> 00:02:09,754
That's how people usually live.

24
00:02:09,838 --> 00:02:12,715
They say hi and look after one another
when they don't have to.

25
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:13,925
That's true.

26
00:02:14,008 --> 00:02:15,635
And sometimes they forget things

27
00:02:15,718 --> 00:02:17,595
and get in the way of others.

28
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:23,601
I'm done with this walk.

29
00:02:24,102 --> 00:02:25,728
Let's go, Nurungji! Jeez.

30
00:02:26,521 --> 00:02:27,856
What's their problem?

31
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:48,751
Do you need something?

32
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:51,087
Yes.

33
00:02:52,964 --> 00:02:54,966
What do you need?

34
00:02:55,049 --> 00:02:56,926
To talk with someone around my age.

35
00:03:09,939 --> 00:03:11,858
It's nice, like I'm on vacation.

36
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:18,907
Once you get bitten a few times,
you'll think otherwise.

37
00:03:19,616 --> 00:03:21,409
They are different from city mosquitos.

38
00:03:23,828 --> 00:03:25,997
You were born and raised here, right?

39
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,917
I think I heard you were earlier.

40
00:03:30,251 --> 00:03:34,005
Except for when I was in college,
I've been living here for 27 years.

41
00:03:34,589 --> 00:03:36,591
And I think I'll continue living here.

42
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:39,594
This is great. We're the same age.

43
00:03:40,178 --> 00:03:41,179
We're friends!

44
00:03:43,556 --> 00:03:44,557
Right.

45
00:03:53,316 --> 00:03:55,026
About Ji-yul…

46
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:58,071
-How is he?
-What?

47
00:03:58,154 --> 00:04:00,531
I'm curious about how he's doing here.

48
00:04:01,157 --> 00:04:03,743
For such a city boy
to stay in a rural place like this…

49
00:04:04,869 --> 00:04:07,789
I don't mean it
in a disparaging way at all, it's just…

50
00:04:07,872 --> 00:04:08,748
I know.

51
00:04:08,831 --> 00:04:11,167
It's just a different kind of place.

52
00:04:11,834 --> 00:04:13,336
Right, a different kind of place.

53
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:17,674
He's been thrown into
a whole new environment.

54
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:19,509
He must be having a hard time adjusting.

55
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:23,554
To the point where he would
tell a weird lie.

56
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:31,771
To tell you the truth,
I am not his girlfriend.

57
00:04:33,022 --> 00:04:35,233
I was before, but…

58
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:40,029
But I'm here
to get back together with him.

59
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:45,493
Maybe that's foolish.

60
00:04:46,661 --> 00:04:47,620
No.

61
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:51,082
We dated during veterinary college.

62
00:04:51,165 --> 00:04:53,960
Now that I think about it,
out of all of my relationships,

63
00:04:54,043 --> 00:04:55,336
that was the happiest time.

64
00:04:56,629 --> 00:04:57,839
You may not believe it,

65
00:04:57,922 --> 00:05:00,258
but Ji-yul was
a very affectionate boyfriend.

66
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:05,555
But I didn't realize that back then.
I was such a fool.

67
00:05:06,889 --> 00:05:08,683
You realize it after it's gone.

68
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:10,643
And that makes me so mad.

69
00:05:15,356 --> 00:05:17,608
I hope you won't have any regrets,
Officer Ahn.

70
00:05:17,692 --> 00:05:20,153
Your boyfriend seemed
like a really nice person.

71
00:05:21,863 --> 00:05:23,114
Right…

72
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:28,202
Seeing him only made me
miss him even more.

73
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:34,167
Help me.

74
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:38,129
I ruined the relationship,
so I can't rekindle it on my own.

75
00:05:38,212 --> 00:05:39,881
"You look good together. Good luck."

76
00:05:39,964 --> 00:05:42,592
I need that kind of active support
from those around us.

77
00:05:43,593 --> 00:05:45,053
You'll help me, right?

78
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:09,327
Why did you go there, Han Ji-yul?

79
00:06:11,704 --> 00:06:12,747
Why…

80
00:06:14,332 --> 00:06:15,374
did you…

81
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:17,627
have to?

82
00:06:48,574 --> 00:06:50,409
May I use the mirror in the living room?

83
00:06:50,493 --> 00:06:52,161
Sure, go ahead.

84
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:57,667
I didn't know you were using it.

85
00:06:58,334 --> 00:07:00,211
No, it's okay. Go ahead and use it.

86
00:07:15,893 --> 00:07:16,811
Thank you.

87
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:32,326
Do you put on full makeup
before going to work?

88
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:33,619
You're so diligent.

89
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:36,080
Well, I keep it simple.

90
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:41,461
Some are even brand new
and still in their packaging.

91
00:07:42,211 --> 00:07:43,463
Did you buy them recently?

92
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:45,006
Yes, well…

93
00:07:45,798 --> 00:07:48,259
I should look attractive for Ji-yul.
Should I do it?

94
00:07:49,427 --> 00:07:50,887
Can I borrow them?

95
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:52,555
Sure, of course.

96
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:53,723
Thank you.

97
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:55,892
I can use this, right?

98
00:08:11,949 --> 00:08:13,159
Why aren't you doing yours?

99
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:16,496
-Do you need this one right now?
-No, I'm not using that.

100
00:08:32,595 --> 00:08:34,680
You should be the first to use it, right?

101
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:36,516
No, it's okay.

102
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:38,518
-Come on, come closer.
-It's really okay…

103
00:08:38,601 --> 00:08:41,145
Just try it. I think
it'll look good on you. Come on.

104
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,523
Look down.

105
00:08:45,316 --> 00:08:46,984
Your eyelashes are really long.

106
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:49,153
Now the upper part.

107
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:52,782
Open your eyes slightly.

108
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:55,368
It's pretty.

109
00:08:56,452 --> 00:08:57,453
Take a look.

110
00:09:04,418 --> 00:09:06,128
Let's do your lips while we're at it.

111
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:08,047
Oh, no. I'm really fine.

112
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:11,342
The color will look great on you.
Come on, just try it once.

113
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:38,286
I really think

114
00:09:38,953 --> 00:09:40,580
I'd better remove the makeup.

115
00:09:40,663 --> 00:09:42,748
You don't like the makeup I did for you?

116
00:09:42,832 --> 00:09:44,917
Oh, no, that's not it.

117
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:49,505
It's just a little heavier than usual.

118
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:53,801
Is that what you think, Officer Ahn?
It looks really pretty to me.

119
00:09:53,884 --> 00:09:55,553
Well, I do like it,

120
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:59,765
but this village is
full of nosy and chatty people.

121
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:03,603
People will say, "Who are you
trying to impress with that makeup?"

122
00:10:03,686 --> 00:10:05,938
"So how many kids are you going to have?"

123
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:07,481
They'll tease me like that.

124
00:10:07,565 --> 00:10:11,110
Who cares about them?
You should live for your own satisfaction.

125
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:15,781
No matter who says what, you just need to
care about only one person. Yourself.

126
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:21,412
I guess I have one more person
to care about.

127
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:24,081
How do I look?

128
00:10:25,082 --> 00:10:25,916
You look pretty.

129
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:28,794
Is there a coffee shop nearby?

130
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:46,020
Here.

131
00:10:47,188 --> 00:10:48,064
Thanks.

132
00:10:50,941 --> 00:10:52,109
You look prettier today.

133
00:10:54,028 --> 00:10:56,656
Here you go again.
You're teasing me, aren't you?

134
00:10:56,739 --> 00:10:58,532
-I'm not.
-Do you want to die?

135
00:10:58,616 --> 00:11:00,201
HIS PEACH FARM

136
00:11:05,998 --> 00:11:07,500
Looks like you became friends.

137
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:11,045
I think she's a nice person.

138
00:11:12,046 --> 00:11:14,757
Someone you can't help but like, you know?

139
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:21,514
What are you doing?
Why did you take a photo of me?

140
00:11:21,597 --> 00:11:23,974
You're dolled up for a change.
We should leave a record.

141
00:11:24,058 --> 00:11:25,142
Let me see.

142
00:11:25,226 --> 00:11:28,062
-Hey, it looks weird!
-No.

143
00:11:28,145 --> 00:11:28,979
Hey!

144
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:31,232
Delete it right now.

145
00:11:31,315 --> 00:11:33,442
Delete it and take another… Delete it!

146
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:35,069
-No, wait.
-What?

147
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:36,654
Stop.

148
00:11:42,618 --> 00:11:45,496
Your cafe is so pretty.
And you two together look even better.

149
00:11:47,706 --> 00:11:49,834
I get that a lot,
but I never get sick of it.

150
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:52,378
Here.

151
00:11:53,254 --> 00:11:54,463
Are you taking it to the hospital?

152
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:56,924
Yes. I've made up my mind,
so I have to go for it.

153
00:11:58,592 --> 00:12:00,761
I really hope you achieve what you want.

154
00:12:00,845 --> 00:12:02,763
As soon as possible.

155
00:12:03,347 --> 00:12:04,348
You can do it.

156
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:06,517
I can do it. Thank you.

157
00:12:28,038 --> 00:12:28,914
Excuse me!

158
00:12:31,667 --> 00:12:33,502
No! Wait a second.

159
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:34,712
Oh my gosh!

160
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:48,058
It's you, right?

161
00:12:48,142 --> 00:12:49,685
The pretty lady from Seoul.

162
00:12:51,103 --> 00:12:53,272
I did come from Seoul.
Do you think I'm pretty?

163
00:12:54,356 --> 00:12:55,941
But not as pretty as Hui-won.

164
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:56,984
Hui-won?

165
00:12:57,067 --> 00:12:58,110
She's my girlfriend.

166
00:12:59,904 --> 00:13:01,989
That's cool.
You appreciate your girlfriend.

167
00:13:02,072 --> 00:13:03,449
That's a given.

168
00:13:05,576 --> 00:13:09,038
By the way, you're not
Doctor Han's girlfriend, are you?

169
00:13:09,747 --> 00:13:10,581
What?

170
00:13:10,664 --> 00:13:13,709
The village ladies are all saying
that you're his girlfriend,

171
00:13:13,792 --> 00:13:15,377
but I disagree.

172
00:13:16,128 --> 00:13:19,006
But when I said that,
they went, "What do you know?"

173
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:20,966
I'm right, aren't I?

174
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:22,426
What makes you think that?

175
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:24,512
That's easy.

176
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:27,598
The doctor's always looking at Ja-young.

177
00:13:29,808 --> 00:13:31,143
You mean Officer Ahn?

178
00:13:32,895 --> 00:13:36,857
The way I see it, he definitely likes her.

179
00:13:37,608 --> 00:13:40,819
He ran over to save her
when she had an accident.

180
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:44,490
Either way,
you're not his girlfriend, right?

181
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:46,116
Right.

182
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:06,011
Stop staring and say it.

183
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:08,389
-You're seeing someone, right?
-No.

184
00:14:08,472 --> 00:14:09,431
Come on.

185
00:14:10,015 --> 00:14:12,393
Then there must be
a wedding to attend, right?

186
00:14:12,476 --> 00:14:13,811
-No.
-I know.

187
00:14:13,894 --> 00:14:17,731
You tried your expired cosmetics
before throwing them out.

188
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,734
My wife does that.

189
00:14:22,194 --> 00:14:25,281
No. Someone just did it for me.

190
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:28,284
I mean, I am a 27-year-old woman.

191
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:30,369
Can't I put on a little makeup?

192
00:14:30,452 --> 00:14:31,787
Is that so weird?

193
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:33,789
No, it's just giving me a lot of thoughts.

194
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:37,543
"When did this little jelly bean grow up
to be wearing makeup?"

195
00:14:37,626 --> 00:14:41,547
You used to be a tiny little outlaw
who shoplifts from the stationery store.

196
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:43,340
When did you grow up so much?

197
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:45,843
Probably while you were
getting old, Chief.

198
00:14:49,221 --> 00:14:50,806
Yes, this is Ahn Ja-young.

199
00:15:02,109 --> 00:15:03,611
HUIDONG RESIDENTS ASSEMBLE

200
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:12,953
What?

201
00:15:13,954 --> 00:15:15,247
Did she put on makeup?

202
00:15:19,543 --> 00:15:20,711
What are you looking at?

203
00:15:22,671 --> 00:15:24,173
-When did you get here?
-Just now.

204
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:25,633
Didn't you hear the door?

205
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:29,511
I got us some coffee.

206
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:31,639
I drank a little on the way,
and it's so good.

207
00:15:31,722 --> 00:15:33,057
He roasts the beans himself.

208
00:15:34,975 --> 00:15:37,186
Hey, Ji-yul,
do you have a spare pair of pants?

209
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:38,938
I look like I peed myself, don't I?

210
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:41,273
What did you do outside?

211
00:15:42,149 --> 00:15:43,317
My goodness.

212
00:15:44,068 --> 00:15:46,236
I got a call
from Mr. Han's livestock barn.

213
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,530
Remember the calf from the other day
that won't suckle?

214
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:49,448
Yes.

215
00:15:49,531 --> 00:15:52,868
It still won't,
and it's severely dehydrated.

216
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:53,994
I think you should go.

217
00:15:54,703 --> 00:15:56,705
Yes, this is the veterinary hospital.

218
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:58,582
Wow, a house call? That's cool.

219
00:16:00,167 --> 00:16:02,586
This is nice.
At least you're looking at me.

220
00:16:03,545 --> 00:16:05,839
Hey, hurry up and get me some pants.

221
00:16:06,757 --> 00:16:08,092
Yes, I understand.

222
00:16:09,551 --> 00:16:12,096
There's a goat with a hernia.
What should we do?

223
00:16:12,179 --> 00:16:13,722
It's crying and screaming.

224
00:16:15,182 --> 00:16:17,309
Where's the barn?
Is it far from the cowshed?

225
00:16:17,393 --> 00:16:18,852
Yes, it's pretty far.

226
00:16:18,936 --> 00:16:21,230
The round trip would take about two hours.

227
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:23,357
Two hours…

228
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:27,778
You go to the goat.

229
00:16:27,861 --> 00:16:29,154
-Me?
-Yes.

230
00:16:29,238 --> 00:16:31,031
You've done countless herniorrhaphies.

231
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:33,826
Those pants will get all dirty anyway,
so don't bother.

232
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:35,661
Get him what he needs.

233
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:42,126
I know what you're thinking,

234
00:16:42,209 --> 00:16:44,545
but he's actually
quite decent as a veterinarian.

235
00:16:45,295 --> 00:16:47,089
What do you mean, "as a veterinarian"?

236
00:16:47,172 --> 00:16:49,550
Are you saying
that I'm lacking in other things?

237
00:16:49,633 --> 00:16:52,094
-Good luck. I'll be back.
-Okay.

238
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:53,470
Let me go with you.

239
00:17:10,738 --> 00:17:12,197
-Ma'am!
-Hey.

240
00:17:14,575 --> 00:17:15,868
I brought some groceries.

241
00:17:15,951 --> 00:17:18,662
Oh, my goodness. Thank you so much.

242
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:21,040
I wish you wouldn't be sick so often.

243
00:17:21,123 --> 00:17:22,082
I'll say.

244
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:23,625
I guess it's a part of getting old.

245
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:25,502
-I'll put this over there.
-Okay.

246
00:17:31,216 --> 00:17:32,843
Where should I put this?

247
00:17:32,926 --> 00:17:34,094
Just put it anywhere.

248
00:17:38,265 --> 00:17:39,683
Ja-young, thank you so much.

249
00:17:39,767 --> 00:17:41,727
-Look at all that sweat.
-What?

250
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:49,610
-Well, I'll be going now.
-Okay.

251
00:17:49,693 --> 00:17:51,236
-Call me anytime you need me.
-I will.

252
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:52,780
-Thanks again.
-Sure.

253
00:18:01,622 --> 00:18:02,498
Mr. Han.

254
00:18:03,123 --> 00:18:04,875
Officer Ahn. What brings you here?

255
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:07,294
I was in the area and just stopped by.

256
00:18:08,128 --> 00:18:10,089
Is there a problem with the cows?

257
00:18:10,172 --> 00:18:13,884
There is. The calf born the other day is
refusing to suckle.

258
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:16,470
-Excuse me, I'm in a rush.
-Okay.

259
00:18:34,238 --> 00:18:35,864
Doesn't it seem like rotavirus?

260
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:36,824
Yes.

261
00:18:36,907 --> 00:18:38,826
When did they start manually feeding it?

262
00:18:39,326 --> 00:18:40,911
About five days ago.

263
00:18:40,994 --> 00:18:43,872
-Is the mother not making enough milk?
-I think it's enough.

264
00:18:45,249 --> 00:18:47,292
-Did you run a blood test?
-Yes.

265
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,294
According to the results,

266
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:53,215
its high hematocrit level
indicates severe dehydration.

267
00:18:54,258 --> 00:18:56,468
It looks like
it has metabolic acidosis too.

268
00:18:58,095 --> 00:18:59,638
In order to correct the acidosis,

269
00:18:59,721 --> 00:19:01,723
I think we should administer
sodium carbonate.

270
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:11,150
Isn't it easier with a partner?

271
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:14,111
Go ahead and explain it to the owner.

272
00:19:15,946 --> 00:19:16,822
Okay.

273
00:19:50,564 --> 00:19:51,899
Hey, Officer Ahn.

274
00:19:53,525 --> 00:19:54,610
Fancy seeing you here.

275
00:19:55,736 --> 00:19:56,695
Hi.

276
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:58,572
Are you here for work?

277
00:19:59,364 --> 00:20:00,616
Yes, sort of.

278
00:20:02,242 --> 00:20:04,620
Why did you remove it all?
It's such a waste.

279
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:07,581
It was just so hot.

280
00:20:08,624 --> 00:20:09,708
Go ahead and wash up.

281
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:11,835
I stink, don't I?

282
00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:13,670
No, that's not it.

283
00:20:13,754 --> 00:20:18,383
I last practiced it ages ago,
but my body still remembers it all.

284
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:20,719
It brings back good old memories.

285
00:20:20,802 --> 00:20:24,473
We used to always be together,
whether it was in the lab or the OR.

286
00:20:27,017 --> 00:20:29,645
We were with many other people.
Divided into teams.

287
00:20:34,107 --> 00:20:35,108
Use this.

288
00:20:37,861 --> 00:20:38,737
Thank you.

289
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:47,454
Hello?

290
00:20:49,831 --> 00:20:51,166
Right now?

291
00:20:52,167 --> 00:20:53,961
Okay, I'll be right there.

292
00:20:54,795 --> 00:20:55,671
Sang-hyeon?

293
00:20:56,421 --> 00:20:59,383
He's probably super busy right now.

294
00:21:00,384 --> 00:21:04,263
Anyway, I got it. I'll try and find out
if anyone can lend a hand.

295
00:21:05,013 --> 00:21:05,847
Yes.

296
00:21:08,016 --> 00:21:11,395
I should get going.
I'll wash this and return it to you.

297
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:14,898
Wait. If you need a hand,

298
00:21:15,607 --> 00:21:17,526
let's go together. I'll help.

299
00:21:50,017 --> 00:21:53,520
HUIDONG PEACH WINE

300
00:21:57,774 --> 00:21:58,900
Oh, my.

301
00:21:59,776 --> 00:22:02,487
Are you guys doing a good job?

302
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:05,365
There you go. Good.

303
00:22:05,449 --> 00:22:07,326
You're doing well. Keep it up.

304
00:22:09,953 --> 00:22:11,997
I'll make something delicious for you.

305
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,999
Auntie, why are there so few peaches?

306
00:22:14,082 --> 00:22:16,793
Gang-hwa had some time to kill
and took a big load,

307
00:22:16,877 --> 00:22:18,754
so that's all there's left.

308
00:22:18,837 --> 00:22:19,838
I see.

309
00:22:19,921 --> 00:22:21,757
-So much easier.
-Okay.

310
00:22:22,507 --> 00:22:23,759
I'll go make this quickly.

311
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:30,098
Why does this one have such a big pit?

312
00:22:47,532 --> 00:22:50,911
The labels are so pretty.
Is there a business that makes them?

313
00:22:50,994 --> 00:22:54,623
Sang-hyeon does it all.
He's really good with this kind of stuff.

314
00:22:55,165 --> 00:22:57,292
-The one who runs that cafe…
-Yes.

315
00:22:58,794 --> 00:23:00,754
He's so talented.

316
00:23:01,671 --> 00:23:02,798
He must have been very popular.

317
00:23:07,677 --> 00:23:11,181
Now that I think about it,
all the girls in class had a crush on him

318
00:23:11,264 --> 00:23:13,433
at least I think they did.

319
00:23:13,517 --> 00:23:15,936
But there weren't
that many people in our school…

320
00:23:16,686 --> 00:23:18,522
Were you one of them, Officer Ahn?

321
00:23:19,648 --> 00:23:20,774
Looking back on it,

322
00:23:21,316 --> 00:23:22,234
I guess I was.

323
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:26,947
You're right, he was my first crush.

324
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:29,491
You're still with your first crush.
That's amazing.

325
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:32,035
He might even be your last love.

326
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:33,703
I think it's totally possible.

327
00:23:33,787 --> 00:23:34,663
Last love?

328
00:23:40,001 --> 00:23:41,545
Well, that's just…

329
00:23:42,295 --> 00:23:45,549
That was back when she was little.
What last love?

330
00:23:45,632 --> 00:23:49,469
You could say the same about me.
We had a pretty good time back then.

331
00:23:58,770 --> 00:23:59,896
What I meant was…

332
00:24:00,564 --> 00:24:03,817
Please take these to the storage shed
right now.

333
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:06,194
-Right now?
-Right now.

334
00:24:33,054 --> 00:24:34,931
Sang-hyeon was her first crush?

335
00:24:36,725 --> 00:24:37,726
First crush?

336
00:24:41,563 --> 00:24:44,524
You two knew each other before?

337
00:24:47,485 --> 00:24:48,612
There was a time

338
00:24:49,487 --> 00:24:52,532
when he stayed in this village
for a little while

339
00:24:52,616 --> 00:24:54,117
because of his parents' accident.

340
00:24:54,701 --> 00:24:56,870
That's when we met. A long time ago.

341
00:24:56,953 --> 00:24:59,039
No way. Really?

342
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:01,374
I see.

343
00:25:01,458 --> 00:25:05,045
I did think the way
he looked at you was oddly intimate.

344
00:25:05,128 --> 00:25:07,088
He doesn't open up to people so easily.

345
00:25:08,256 --> 00:25:11,885
But it definitely seems possible with you.

346
00:25:13,094 --> 00:25:14,012
Yes.

347
00:25:14,095 --> 00:25:15,847
That must be why.

348
00:25:16,431 --> 00:25:17,974
I'm so relieved all of a sudden.

349
00:25:18,683 --> 00:25:21,478
I was really shocked
by what he said earlier.

350
00:25:21,561 --> 00:25:24,439
So you were just
a close friend in this village, right?

351
00:25:26,608 --> 00:25:27,484
Hey!

352
00:25:28,235 --> 00:25:30,528
Come inside and have a taste.

353
00:25:30,612 --> 00:25:32,489
We're not sure if you'll like it.

354
00:25:32,572 --> 00:25:34,199
We're arguing about it.

355
00:25:34,282 --> 00:25:35,909
-Sure.
-Come now.

356
00:25:36,701 --> 00:25:37,786
Come on.

357
00:26:11,695 --> 00:26:13,989
You're avoiding eye contact.

358
00:26:14,072 --> 00:26:15,365
Is it just in my head?

359
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:17,951
Yes.

360
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:58,158
Did you give him an answer?

361
00:27:04,831 --> 00:27:06,541
He said he had feelings for you.

362
00:27:07,876 --> 00:27:09,794
I happened to overhear it.

363
00:27:13,506 --> 00:27:16,092
Why do you want to know that?

364
00:27:18,219 --> 00:27:20,221
Be good to Min.

365
00:27:20,805 --> 00:27:23,391
I think she's almost too good

366
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:25,935
for you.

367
00:27:28,438 --> 00:27:29,647
Why would I?

368
00:27:29,731 --> 00:27:31,066
What do you mean, why?

369
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:34,444
You two work in the same field.

370
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:39,032
And you could see each other often
once you're back in Seoul.

371
00:27:39,699 --> 00:27:42,285
She's in the past,
no matter how good it was.

372
00:27:44,371 --> 00:27:48,124
I feel nothing towards Min.
No lingering feelings or regrets.

373
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:51,378
I'm just letting her be

374
00:27:52,337 --> 00:27:54,339
because I know what kind of person she is.

375
00:27:55,298 --> 00:27:56,800
No matter what I say,

376
00:27:56,883 --> 00:27:59,636
she's the type of person
who has to do as she decides.

377
00:28:00,512 --> 00:28:02,263
That's why I'm just waiting

378
00:28:03,181 --> 00:28:04,766
for her to give up on her own.

379
00:28:04,849 --> 00:28:07,560
You know her so well.

380
00:28:11,606 --> 00:28:13,566
I've known her for a long time.

381
00:28:18,613 --> 00:28:19,948
That's probably why

382
00:28:20,698 --> 00:28:22,492
Sang-hyeon knows me so well.

383
00:28:23,493 --> 00:28:24,619
Right?

384
00:28:29,582 --> 00:28:30,417
So what?

385
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:33,753
Do you want to date

386
00:28:34,712 --> 00:28:35,880
someone you know well?

387
00:28:39,592 --> 00:28:41,511
I'm still thinking about it.

388
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:51,104
Being used to someone is different
from romantic feelings.

389
00:29:02,449 --> 00:29:03,575
Being comfortable is

390
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:06,828
a critical component
of a good relationship.

391
00:29:08,329 --> 00:29:09,539
Imagine being with someone

392
00:29:10,248 --> 00:29:11,082
who makes your heart race

393
00:29:11,958 --> 00:29:14,210
and makes you nervous.

394
00:29:15,253 --> 00:29:17,505
-Your heart wouldn't be able to take--
-Isn't that…

395
00:29:18,089 --> 00:29:19,257
what love is?

396
00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:25,472
When your heart races so much that
you feel like your heart can't take it.

397
00:29:31,352 --> 00:29:32,520
Does Sang-hyeon make you…

398
00:29:34,314 --> 00:29:35,356
feel that way?

399
00:29:43,156 --> 00:29:46,117
All right, snack time!
Stop working and have some snacks!

400
00:29:46,201 --> 00:29:48,036
-Snack time!
-Okay.

401
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:03,009
Our guest from Seoul helped us so much.

402
00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:05,762
-Now we just need to get the funds for…
-That's how we…

403
00:30:05,845 --> 00:30:07,639
-Hey, come here.
-Come eat.

404
00:30:08,223 --> 00:30:09,682
Officer Ahn, try some of--

405
00:30:09,766 --> 00:30:12,727
I'm being called in for work.
You'll have to excuse me.

406
00:30:13,561 --> 00:30:14,604
See you later, aunties.

407
00:30:16,648 --> 00:30:17,941
-Ja-young.
-Hey, Ja-young.

408
00:30:18,691 --> 00:30:19,901
Thanks for your help!

409
00:30:19,984 --> 00:30:21,152
Excuse me for a moment.

410
00:30:27,909 --> 00:30:29,035
Man.

411
00:30:29,911 --> 00:30:32,497
Something definitely happened in there.

412
00:30:44,843 --> 00:30:45,718
Ji-yul.

413
00:30:59,566 --> 00:31:00,692
What's all this?

414
00:31:00,775 --> 00:31:02,861
The president of
Majeong Women's Association

415
00:31:02,944 --> 00:31:04,028
just dropped it off.

416
00:31:04,112 --> 00:31:06,114
To thank you
for treating her mother's dog.

417
00:31:06,656 --> 00:31:08,283
Why did she give this to me…

418
00:31:12,328 --> 00:31:14,122
-Yes, Ms. Park.
-Did you get it?

419
00:31:14,205 --> 00:31:17,125
I did get it,
but you didn't have to give me so much…

420
00:31:17,208 --> 00:31:18,126
My mom was about to

421
00:31:18,668 --> 00:31:21,462
just sit there and watch the dog die.

422
00:31:21,546 --> 00:31:23,131
She wanted to thank you.

423
00:31:23,673 --> 00:31:26,926
As for the corn,
I was going to divide it in half

424
00:31:27,010 --> 00:31:29,262
and give it to both you and the doctor.

425
00:31:29,762 --> 00:31:31,306
But when I called the hospital,

426
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:35,101
he said,
"Just give it all to Officer Ahn."

427
00:31:36,561 --> 00:31:38,396
And do you know what he said after that?

428
00:31:40,523 --> 00:31:42,483
He said he heard
what I said the other day.

429
00:31:42,567 --> 00:31:44,360
"I also don't have parents, so I know."

430
00:31:44,444 --> 00:31:47,530
"You shouldn't talk
about her not having parents."

431
00:31:47,614 --> 00:31:49,532
Can you believe that?

432
00:31:50,158 --> 00:31:52,535
I was just flabbergasted, seriously.

433
00:31:52,619 --> 00:31:53,745
What's his problem?

434
00:32:20,688 --> 00:32:24,067
Ji-yul. You are going to
go back to Seoul, right?

435
00:32:25,193 --> 00:32:26,486
I should.

436
00:32:27,111 --> 00:32:28,404
My hospital is there.

437
00:32:28,488 --> 00:32:30,740
I'll be working in Korea
starting next month.

438
00:32:30,823 --> 00:32:32,200
Near your hospital.

439
00:32:35,662 --> 00:32:36,621
-Min.
-I don't expect us

440
00:32:36,704 --> 00:32:38,122
to be close like before immediately.

441
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:40,041
I'm sure you need time.

442
00:32:40,708 --> 00:32:43,252
You'll change once you start
seeing me more often.

443
00:32:43,336 --> 00:32:45,129
Like you and Officer Ahn right now.

444
00:32:47,256 --> 00:32:50,468
It's natural to develop feelings
for someone who helps you out

445
00:32:51,010 --> 00:32:52,679
in an unfamiliar place.

446
00:32:53,721 --> 00:32:56,975
But you'll forget about it
once you go back to your normal life.

447
00:32:58,059 --> 00:32:59,477
You're going back to Seoul.

448
00:33:02,647 --> 00:33:03,690
Min.

449
00:33:04,315 --> 00:33:05,149
I…

450
00:33:45,982 --> 00:33:49,027
Is it about that nosy girl
who made you run out all of a sudden?

451
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:50,319
Is it the long-distance relationship?

452
00:33:50,403 --> 00:33:52,071
Or is it the fact that it's one-sided?

453
00:33:52,155 --> 00:33:53,656
If it's not either of those things,

454
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:55,324
is there some rival that you must defeat?

455
00:33:55,408 --> 00:33:56,951
Gosh, what a sore sight.

456
00:33:57,618 --> 00:34:00,329
I'm not curious
what you two did or will do.

457
00:34:00,413 --> 00:34:03,249
You're crossing the line right now.
Do you know that?

458
00:34:03,332 --> 00:34:04,876
If that's how you really feel,

459
00:34:04,959 --> 00:34:07,545
you should make it clear.

460
00:34:08,129 --> 00:34:09,756
I immediately thought of you.

461
00:34:10,339 --> 00:34:12,175
I thought I should come to you.

462
00:34:12,258 --> 00:34:15,011
