1
00:00:41,583 --> 00:00:42,959
"Dress."

2
00:00:44,794 --> 00:00:45,628
"S…"

3
00:00:45,712 --> 00:00:47,589
-Come on, Dad. Hurry up!
-"Sheesh."

4
00:00:47,672 --> 00:00:49,090
That's not a word.

5
00:00:49,174 --> 00:00:50,842
You're so bad at this.

6
00:00:51,801 --> 00:00:53,636
No, wait, I know. "Samcheonpo."

7
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:54,929
"Samcheonpo"?

8
00:00:55,555 --> 00:00:56,514
What's that?

9
00:00:56,598 --> 00:00:59,184
It's the name of a village
near your grandpa's house.

10
00:00:59,934 --> 00:01:01,352
All right. Now it's "O."

11
00:01:02,812 --> 00:01:04,355
"O…"

12
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:06,441
"Ocean." Now it's Mom's turn.

13
00:01:06,524 --> 00:01:07,400
"Ocean"?

14
00:01:08,151 --> 00:01:10,361
All right. "N…"

15
00:01:11,279 --> 00:01:12,155
"Nephew"?

16
00:01:34,886 --> 00:01:37,096
Hey, wake up!

17
00:01:41,893 --> 00:01:44,062
Hey, wake up!

18
00:01:44,896 --> 00:01:45,772
Hey!

19
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:47,816
Hey!

20
00:01:51,069 --> 00:01:54,906
Hey! Open the door, kid!

21
00:02:13,049 --> 00:02:14,759
Officer Ahn, are you okay?

22
00:02:27,272 --> 00:02:28,940
Make some room over there.

23
00:02:32,527 --> 00:02:35,613
He's in shock, so stay with him.
Okay, Ja-young?

24
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:42,495
Hey, are you okay?

25
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:43,413
Oh, no.

26
00:02:45,081 --> 00:02:45,957
Are you okay?

27
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:31,044
Is she badly hurt?

28
00:03:31,127 --> 00:03:33,630
The doctor said neither of them
suffered serious injuries.

29
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:36,549
She's just asleep, so don't worry.

30
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:38,968
The chief went to check on Sergeant Yoon.

31
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:47,227
Wait.

32
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:50,188
Why are you here?

33
00:03:52,815 --> 00:03:53,900
I don't know.

34
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:56,361
I just happened to be.

35
00:04:00,531 --> 00:04:01,532
In any case,

36
00:04:01,616 --> 00:04:02,784
thank you.

37
00:04:04,327 --> 00:04:07,247
You must be her guardian.
Please come fill out some paperwork.

38
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:08,331
Sure.

39
00:05:07,265 --> 00:05:08,683
Do you know where you are?

40
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:14,230
What about Sergeant Yoon?

41
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:16,274
He's waiting for some lab results.

42
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:20,361
He's walking around the exam room,
so I think he's okay.

43
00:05:22,572 --> 00:05:24,615
Are you sure you're okay?

44
00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:27,368
I'm okay.

45
00:05:28,411 --> 00:05:29,287
I'm okay.

46
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,460
By the way,

47
00:05:36,627 --> 00:05:38,588
how did I get here?

48
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,341
I think Doctor Han

49
00:05:43,092 --> 00:05:44,427
got me out of the car.

50
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:47,805
I just spoke with the chief on the phone,

51
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:51,184
and it seems he reported the accident
and headed to the site.

52
00:05:51,267 --> 00:05:52,810
He must have been with Seon-dong.

53
00:05:54,604 --> 00:05:56,355
You were on the phone with him, right?

54
00:06:00,109 --> 00:06:00,985
Does it bother you?

55
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:06,991
You owe him one.

56
00:06:07,575 --> 00:06:10,745
-Does that upset you?
-I'm upset by the look on your face.

57
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:14,665
What look do I have on my face?

58
00:06:18,127 --> 00:06:19,087
An ugly look.

59
00:06:23,424 --> 00:06:26,260
Wait here. I'll go get the doctor.

60
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:26,070
Thank you for today…

61
00:07:37,832 --> 00:07:39,959
You must have gotten soaked in the rain.

62
00:07:40,042 --> 00:07:41,294
Are you okay…

63
00:08:57,787 --> 00:08:59,455
SANDEUL POLICE STATION

64
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:00,957
What are you guys doing here?

65
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:06,337
What is the matter with you two?

66
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:09,840
Are you that determined
to make me look like an evil boss?

67
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:14,595
You must be here because she's here,
and what's your story? You have a limp.

68
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:17,682
I'm not. I came in because I wanted to.

69
00:09:18,349 --> 00:09:19,350
Not because of her.

70
00:09:21,102 --> 00:09:22,186
I mean,

71
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:24,647
the Eastern medicine clinic director
is really good.

72
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:28,109
I got acupuncture yesterday,
and I'm totally fine now. See?

73
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:31,862
You should still get some rest.
Don't you know how to do that?

74
00:09:31,946 --> 00:09:34,907
We both got our tests done yesterday,
and they said we were okay.

75
00:09:34,991 --> 00:09:37,618
And we couldn't visit
Mr. Pyeong-sik's place yesterday

76
00:09:37,702 --> 00:09:38,995
because of the accident.

77
00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:42,164
We'll take it easy as if we're on break.

78
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:47,545
She's right, sir.
Corporal Hong can't do the evening shift.

79
00:09:47,628 --> 00:09:49,422
There will be a problem without us.

80
00:09:50,298 --> 00:09:51,215
We'll stay.

81
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:54,093
You do have a point.

82
00:09:55,136 --> 00:09:57,597
You're both grown-ups
who can make their own decisions.

83
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,600
I can't stop you from being responsible.

84
00:10:00,683 --> 00:10:02,101
Geun-mo, you can work.

85
00:10:02,685 --> 00:10:04,270
-What?
-You go.

86
00:10:04,353 --> 00:10:06,230
-What, why?
-Go home.

87
00:10:07,398 --> 00:10:09,191
I know you're still in pain.

88
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:10,526
Come on, Chief!

89
00:10:12,528 --> 00:10:15,615
I don't care.
I already came in, so I'm going to work.

90
00:10:16,782 --> 00:10:19,535
I'm going on patrol.
I'll go to Mr. Pyeong-sik's place.

91
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:21,704
Hey, wait!

92
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:25,374
Gosh, she is just so stubborn!

93
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:28,794
Chief, do I really have to work today?

94
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:31,213
My neck is still…

95
00:10:34,342 --> 00:10:37,595
SANDEUL POLICE STATION

96
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:47,146
I don't know.

97
00:10:47,229 --> 00:10:50,274
He just said he was going out
and told me to call him

98
00:10:50,358 --> 00:10:52,193
if anything happens.

99
00:10:52,276 --> 00:10:54,028
Why? You want to thank him?

100
00:10:55,404 --> 00:10:56,614
Something like that.

101
00:10:56,697 --> 00:10:59,200
He was the one who called
to report the accident.

102
00:11:00,618 --> 00:11:02,745
Are you okay? Does it hurt anywhere?

103
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:04,538
I'm okay.

104
00:11:06,707 --> 00:11:08,084
And what's in that bag?

105
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:12,004
I'm going to check in on Mr. Pyeong-sik.

106
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:13,923
You know, it rained a lot yesterday.

107
00:11:14,006 --> 00:11:17,176
If the roof came down again,
he must have struggled all night.

108
00:11:17,802 --> 00:11:20,054
That's great, but you should take it easy.

109
00:11:20,638 --> 00:11:22,056
Trauma from car accidents can be serious.

110
00:11:22,973 --> 00:11:25,768
I will. See you later, Yeong-suk.

111
00:11:25,851 --> 00:11:27,395
All right.

112
00:11:29,271 --> 00:11:31,357
Thanks for the popsicle.

113
00:11:33,317 --> 00:11:34,235
Gosh.

114
00:11:38,697 --> 00:11:45,204
HAN DEOK-JIN VETERINARY HOSPITAL

115
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:50,000
I wonder where he went.

116
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:53,105
HAN JEONG-HO, YOON GYEONG-MI

117
00:14:00,881 --> 00:14:02,049
Hello.

118
00:14:08,055 --> 00:14:09,640
How's your leg?

119
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:12,434
It's fine.

120
00:14:14,728 --> 00:14:17,106
I wanted to really thank you
for yesterday--

121
00:14:18,857 --> 00:14:20,859
-Just a moment, please.
-Sure.

122
00:14:23,445 --> 00:14:24,405
Yes, Ms. Lee.

123
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:29,618
Now?

124
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:33,163
Yes, I understand.
I'll call you again when I'm close.

125
00:14:33,831 --> 00:14:34,790
Yes.

126
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:38,544
I'm afraid I've got to run now.

127
00:14:38,627 --> 00:14:40,462
It's okay. You should go.

128
00:15:07,448 --> 00:15:08,324
Hey, Ahn Ja-young!

129
00:15:10,868 --> 00:15:11,702
What?

130
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:19,335
You really don't listen.

131
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:22,504
-I can't just loaf around.
-Is everything fine at Mr. Pyeong-sik's?

132
00:15:23,005 --> 00:15:24,632
The house seemed okay.

133
00:15:25,174 --> 00:15:28,093
-But I'm worried that his bull is sick.
-What?

134
00:15:29,678 --> 00:15:30,721
Never mind!

135
00:15:31,555 --> 00:15:34,975
I almost forgot.
The thing with Majeong is today, right?

136
00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:37,519
Yes, I'm headed over there
after I park this.

137
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:41,982
Hey, you should come too.

138
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:45,361
They're bound to fight.
It wouldn't hurt to have a cop there.

139
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:48,948
Gosh, I'm getting a headache already.

140
00:15:49,657 --> 00:15:51,241
Why do they fight so much?

141
00:15:51,325 --> 00:15:54,453
Let them be.
You'll just get hurt trying to stop them.

142
00:15:58,374 --> 00:15:59,249
Listen.

143
00:16:00,334 --> 00:16:02,836
-About what you said last time…
-What?

144
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:06,423
That thing you told me last time.
I thought about it, and…

145
00:16:06,507 --> 00:16:08,842
-Think some more!
-What?

146
00:16:12,721 --> 00:16:14,765
Jeez, you punk.

147
00:16:35,494 --> 00:16:36,495
Excuse me.

148
00:16:39,289 --> 00:16:40,249
Anyone home?

149
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:42,960
Who is it?

150
00:17:01,145 --> 00:17:02,771
Not looking good, is it?

151
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:05,441
He doesn't sound too good.

152
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:07,776
He's so old,

153
00:17:08,318 --> 00:17:11,155
and it's been over a month
since she stopped eating on his own.

154
00:17:11,739 --> 00:17:13,449
His organs must have deteriorated.

155
00:17:14,324 --> 00:17:16,035
His feces looks bad too.

156
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:19,872
In his current state,
there really isn't much treatment

157
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:22,499
I can give him.

158
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:25,544
I didn't call your hospital

159
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:30,758
to ask you to save this bull.

160
00:17:31,425 --> 00:17:35,929
I heard there was this thing
called euthanasia or something.

161
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:39,141
I was wondering if you could do that.

162
00:17:41,268 --> 00:17:44,104
You want to euthanize the bull?

163
00:17:44,188 --> 00:17:48,484
Unlike pet dogs, he was born as livestock.

164
00:17:49,193 --> 00:17:52,863
I know livestock are
intended to work all their lives for us

165
00:17:53,489 --> 00:17:59,119
and just get buried
once they die of old age.

166
00:18:00,871 --> 00:18:02,039
However,

167
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:04,541
to me,

168
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:07,336
he's like family!

169
00:18:12,257 --> 00:18:16,720
One day of starvation is painful enough.

170
00:18:16,804 --> 00:18:21,266
And this one's only had water
for the last 30 days.

171
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:23,602
He must be in so much pain.

172
00:18:26,188 --> 00:18:29,233
He's going to die either way.

173
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:34,154
I'm just asking you
to make it less painful for him.

174
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:36,490
Can you please do that for him?

175
00:18:37,699 --> 00:18:39,451
Please.

176
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:48,127
Honestly, I don't understand
why we're having this meeting at all.

177
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:50,546
It's National Singing Contest
we're talking about here.

178
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:52,589
"National," you know?

179
00:18:53,215 --> 00:18:57,636
It's not like we can do it
at a small village community center.

180
00:18:58,303 --> 00:19:02,975
We would need an assembly hall
at the very least.

181
00:19:03,058 --> 00:19:05,602
People need to go to restrooms too,
you know?

182
00:19:05,686 --> 00:19:08,564
We need a proper venue for an event,
don't you think?

183
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:12,651
-Hear, hear!
-She's right!

184
00:19:13,861 --> 00:19:17,531
Huidong also has a suitable public venue.

185
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:21,201
Right here. Huidong Elementary School.

186
00:19:21,285 --> 00:19:24,538
You all know it's the third
most beautiful school in Korea, right?

187
00:19:25,247 --> 00:19:28,667
Majeong may have a college campus,
but think about its location.

188
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:31,920
There's nothing but empty fields
around it.

189
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:35,841
We've been working to specialize
in our peaches for six years.

190
00:19:36,466 --> 00:19:37,759
They're in season right now,

191
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:40,095
and you can smell the peaches in the air.

192
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:45,100
Whether it be orchards or walls,
every corner of our village is beautiful.

193
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:47,394
It'll make for some great footage,
Mr. Producer.

194
00:19:50,647 --> 00:19:54,610
Sang-hyeon could even win
a straight man's heart.

195
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:01,783
I get that you want to capture

196
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:03,702
a pretty picture.

197
00:20:03,785 --> 00:20:06,580
But Huidong is just too shabby

198
00:20:06,663 --> 00:20:09,833
to even compete with Majeong.
That's what I'm saying.

199
00:20:09,917 --> 00:20:15,005
How can you even compare
an elementary school with a college?

200
00:20:15,088 --> 00:20:18,258
People already look down on the country.
And an elementary school?

201
00:20:18,342 --> 00:20:22,596
I mean, people will think
we're hosting a children's talent show.

202
00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:28,602
If you show the green campus lawn
with tall college buildings behind it,

203
00:20:28,685 --> 00:20:32,272
that will look really good,
don't you think?

204
00:20:35,275 --> 00:20:37,569
Come on, let's be honest.

205
00:20:37,653 --> 00:20:40,447
Just think which picture would
look better to the viewers.

206
00:20:43,992 --> 00:20:47,996
A country village has
its own charm and beauty.

207
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:53,794
Why come all this way to do a shoot
if they want to see some buildings?

208
00:20:53,877 --> 00:20:56,088
There are plenty of those in the city.

209
00:20:57,005 --> 00:21:00,467
There's beauty to be found
in a small village like this,

210
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:03,679
and there are
beautiful people like us in it.

211
00:21:04,346 --> 00:21:07,933
Isn't that the whole point
of the National Singing Contest?

212
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:12,354
Can you even call that a village?

213
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:15,357
There are more empty houses than people.

214
00:21:17,192 --> 00:21:18,068
What?

215
00:21:18,151 --> 00:21:21,196
It's empty even during the day,
and if you run into someone,

216
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,323
it's a gray-haired old-timer.

217
00:21:23,407 --> 00:21:25,284
It's just a ridiculous idea

218
00:21:25,367 --> 00:21:29,121
to host a national show like this
in a ghost town like that!

219
00:21:29,204 --> 00:21:30,372
That's just your greed!

220
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:34,793
What? A ghost town?

221
00:21:34,876 --> 00:21:37,379
Hey, did you just call our village
a ghost town?

222
00:21:37,462 --> 00:21:39,339
Do you think you'll never get old?

223
00:21:39,423 --> 00:21:42,801
How dare you call a village
full of living people a ghost town?

224
00:21:42,884 --> 00:21:43,969
How impudent.

225
00:21:44,052 --> 00:21:47,264
Are you trying to show
how stupid and uneducated you are?

226
00:21:47,347 --> 00:21:49,141
Do living people seem like ghosts to you?

227
00:21:49,891 --> 00:21:51,768
Damn it, what did you just say?

228
00:21:52,561 --> 00:21:55,397
Hey, are you highly educated then?
Are you?

229
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:59,109
We're both only high school graduates,
but you always look down on me.

230
00:21:59,192 --> 00:22:02,321
You must think you're smart now
since your husband's well-educated,

231
00:22:02,404 --> 00:22:04,156
but you're utterly mistaken!

232
00:22:04,239 --> 00:22:05,490
What did you say?

233
00:22:05,574 --> 00:22:07,534
And I didn't say anything wrong.

234
00:22:07,617 --> 00:22:08,910
It is a ghost town!

235
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:10,662
The village is so shabby

236
00:22:10,746 --> 00:22:13,457
that all the young people leave!

237
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:16,918
Why are you making such a fuss
to hold an event in a village like that?

238
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:18,211
Know your place!

239
00:22:18,295 --> 00:22:22,299
Listen to this woman spewing nonsense.
What? Shabby?

240
00:22:22,382 --> 00:22:24,634
Did you just say shabby?

241
00:22:24,718 --> 00:22:27,387
We could never beat your village
in shabbiness.

242
00:22:27,471 --> 00:22:29,556
It's overflowing with cow poop and trash.

243
00:22:29,639 --> 00:22:32,768
On top of that, there's the load of crap
coming out of your mouth.

244
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:34,311
We could never beat you!

245
00:22:34,394 --> 00:22:35,771
What did you just say?

246
00:22:35,854 --> 00:22:38,190
-Hey, use words, please.
-What?

247
00:22:38,273 --> 00:22:39,232
Just use words.

248
00:22:39,316 --> 00:22:40,484
Stay out of it!

249
00:22:42,444 --> 00:22:45,363
Hey, did you just put your hands
on one of our village residents?

250
00:22:45,447 --> 00:22:47,991
You're going to die today!

251
00:22:49,493 --> 00:22:51,286
Don't stop me!

252
00:22:51,369 --> 00:22:53,371
What is wrong with all of you?

253
00:22:53,455 --> 00:22:55,874
You can't do this
in front of our guests from Seoul!

254
00:22:55,957 --> 00:22:57,084
This is embarrassing!

255
00:22:57,167 --> 00:22:58,752
What? "Embarrassing"?

256
00:22:58,835 --> 00:23:00,837
Adults handling business is embarrassing?

257
00:23:01,421 --> 00:23:04,382
Listen to this.
This is what they call uneducated, okay?

258
00:23:04,466 --> 00:23:06,885
You've spoiled her
just because she has no parents.

259
00:23:06,968 --> 00:23:09,179
Look at her looking down on me like this!

260
00:23:09,721 --> 00:23:12,849
You just won't stop
spewing nonsense, will you?

261
00:23:12,933 --> 00:23:14,351
Look here, you bitch!

262
00:23:14,434 --> 00:23:18,522
Have you had a child yourself?
What do you even know? You know nothing!

263
00:23:18,605 --> 00:23:21,358
Did your parents teach you
to be such a bitch?

264
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:24,194
Auntie, what are you doing? Let go!

265
00:23:25,445 --> 00:23:27,405
-Let her go and talk it out!
-I didn't…

266
00:23:27,489 --> 00:23:30,492
-Let go!
-I didn't say anything wrong!

267
00:23:31,284 --> 00:23:34,704
Let go of me!

268
00:23:34,788 --> 00:23:36,706
-Get over here!
-Let go, you bitch!

269
00:23:39,334 --> 00:23:40,752
That's enough!

270
00:23:44,631 --> 00:23:46,633
I don't care if you think I'm impudent.

271
00:23:47,217 --> 00:23:51,346
I'm not here
as the uncultured orphan Ahn Ja-young,

272
00:23:51,429 --> 00:23:53,890
but as a police officer
of Sandeul Police Station.

273
00:23:53,974 --> 00:23:55,684
So I can't help but break this up.

274
00:23:56,893 --> 00:24:00,605
You better break it up unless
you want to end up at the station, okay?

275
00:24:02,107 --> 00:24:02,941
Hey!

276
00:24:03,775 --> 00:24:06,444
I took pity on you
because you have no parents.

277
00:24:06,528 --> 00:24:08,697
Why do you always take Huidong's side?

278
00:24:10,448 --> 00:24:13,410
My tax money goes into your paycheck too,
you know!

279
00:24:14,703 --> 00:24:17,080
Hey! Ja-young pays taxes too!

280
00:24:17,164 --> 00:24:20,584
She also has the right to do
as she wishes! You got that?

281
00:25:05,128 --> 00:25:08,340
In that case,
you should use a muscle relaxant.

282
00:25:08,423 --> 00:25:10,258
It certainly is a rare case, though.

283
00:25:11,092 --> 00:25:13,011
Euthanizing a livestock animal…

284
00:25:13,094 --> 00:25:14,638
I can't succinylcholine on its own.

285
00:25:14,721 --> 00:25:16,848
-It won't relieve the pain.
-What about Rompun?

286
00:25:16,932 --> 00:25:20,560
Rompun is a sedative, not an anesthetic,
so he'll still be conscious.

287
00:25:21,436 --> 00:25:23,104
I need an anesthetic.

288
00:25:23,188 --> 00:25:25,982
What I have here isn't enough
to put a bull to sleep.

289
00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:28,735
Then you should go ahead

290
00:25:28,818 --> 00:25:31,613
and search for a veterinary pharmacy
nearby.

291
00:25:31,696 --> 00:25:32,906
There should be one.

292
00:25:32,989 --> 00:25:36,159
-I'll look into it and call you back.
-Okay.

293
00:25:36,243 --> 00:25:39,329
And try not to feel so bad.

294
00:25:39,412 --> 00:25:41,831
It's not the same as humane slaughters,
you know?

295
00:25:45,252 --> 00:25:48,296
Anyway, I understand. I'll call you back.

296
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:49,297
Okay.

297
00:26:12,862 --> 00:26:13,989
I'm sorry.

298
00:26:14,072 --> 00:26:15,532
It's okay. Well, then.

299
00:26:51,818 --> 00:26:52,819
Are you okay?

300
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:55,989
Of course. I'm fine.

301
00:27:03,788 --> 00:27:04,748
Let's go.

302
00:27:06,166 --> 00:27:07,000
I…

303
00:27:09,377 --> 00:27:10,545
I want to take a walk.

304
00:27:11,296 --> 00:27:13,631
I need to patrol the area anyway.

305
00:27:14,466 --> 00:27:15,675
Then let's walk together.

306
00:27:18,345 --> 00:27:20,722
-I meant alone.
-What can I do for you? Tell me.

307
00:27:20,805 --> 00:27:23,099
Do you want a cooler full of beer?

308
00:27:24,434 --> 00:27:26,353
Yes, that sounds good.

309
00:27:29,814 --> 00:27:31,608
Call me when you're done.

310
00:29:06,578 --> 00:29:07,454
Sir.

311
00:29:07,537 --> 00:29:10,749
I'm going to administer
a total of two shots.

312
00:29:11,374 --> 00:29:13,835
An anesthetic first,
and then a drug to stop his heart.

313
00:29:13,918 --> 00:29:16,421
He won't feel a thing.

314
00:29:16,504 --> 00:29:18,131
There might be some convulsions,

315
00:29:18,214 --> 00:29:20,633
but they're not due to pain,
so don't be startled.

316
00:29:34,439 --> 00:29:35,857
Thank you.

317
00:29:36,649 --> 00:29:39,736
Whatever you're born as in your next life,

318
00:29:40,361 --> 00:29:41,404
come back to me.

319
00:29:42,530 --> 00:29:44,491
I'll see you again, okay?

320
00:29:49,746 --> 00:29:54,709
My wife could come back in some form,

321
00:29:56,127 --> 00:29:57,670
so let the three of us meet again

322
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:01,382
and live happily together.

323
00:30:03,927 --> 00:30:06,429
There, there. Lie down.

324
00:30:06,513 --> 00:30:08,598
It hurts, doesn't it?

325
00:30:34,249 --> 00:30:35,083
Here.

326
00:30:45,718 --> 00:30:48,304
-Thank you.
-No, I should thank you.

327
00:30:49,347 --> 00:30:53,685
You ran around here and there.
I'm sure it wasn't easy.

328
00:30:54,602 --> 00:30:56,145
Thank you for what you did.

329
00:30:57,397 --> 00:30:58,231
You're welcome.

330
00:31:02,819 --> 00:31:04,737
Looks like my bull isn't the only thing

331
00:31:05,905 --> 00:31:07,824
that is on your mind today.

332
00:31:10,577 --> 00:31:11,411
Well…

333
00:31:12,745 --> 00:31:13,788
I guess you're right.

334
00:31:13,872 --> 00:31:16,124
You miss them a lot, don't you?

335
00:31:17,208 --> 00:31:18,626
Your mom and dad.

336
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:21,296
I'm sorry?

337
00:31:24,257 --> 00:31:26,092
It was around this time of the year.

338
00:31:26,175 --> 00:31:29,304
Your grandfather asked me for help.

339
00:31:30,471 --> 00:31:35,393
He was busy with the funeral
and his hospital,

340
00:31:35,977 --> 00:31:41,065
so he asked me to watch his
grandson for a few days.

341
00:31:41,149 --> 00:31:43,776
His face was as white as a sheet.

342
00:31:45,486 --> 00:31:48,197
And you've become such a fine young man.

343
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:52,994
I bet he's got
nothing to be worried about now.

344
00:31:53,077 --> 00:31:54,704
You can talk properly now too.

345
00:31:58,458 --> 00:32:01,336
I'm sorry I didn't recognize you
right away.

346
00:32:03,588 --> 00:32:07,175
In life, there are things
you'd rather forget.

347
00:32:08,426 --> 00:32:13,014
Today will be something
I'd rather forget, too.

348
00:32:18,061 --> 00:32:20,855
I've been living with that bull
for 30 years.

349
00:32:22,857 --> 00:32:27,445
It feels strange to think that he's gone.

350
00:32:29,781 --> 00:32:32,909
Would you like help burying him?

351
00:32:35,244 --> 00:32:36,204
No.

352
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:42,543
It'd be embarrassing
to cry in front of you.

353
00:32:43,753 --> 00:32:46,381
I held back my tears earlier.

354
00:32:47,006 --> 00:32:49,634
And you want me to hold it in
when I bury him too?

355
00:32:51,094 --> 00:32:52,595
I can't do that.

356
00:32:56,432 --> 00:32:58,935
I'm going to tell him

357
00:32:59,018 --> 00:33:00,812
all the things I couldn't.

358
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:04,774
"I'll live out my remaining days
and join you soon."

359
00:33:05,858 --> 00:33:07,026
"I'll see you then."

360
00:33:08,194 --> 00:33:10,279
"If I miss you too much before then,

361
00:33:10,822 --> 00:33:13,074
I'll forget you for a little while."

362
00:33:15,618 --> 00:33:18,663
I have so much to say to that bull.

363
00:33:22,417 --> 00:33:26,963
I'm suddenly reminded of
what my mother used to say.

364
00:33:28,506 --> 00:33:32,218
"As long as you don't forget
about someone you yearn to see,

365
00:33:32,802 --> 00:33:36,055
they will come to you
as the rain or even as the wind."

366
00:33:37,598 --> 00:33:42,020
I wonder if my mother
came back as that bull.

367
00:33:57,702 --> 00:33:58,995
I'll come visit again.

368
00:33:59,078 --> 00:34:01,330
Why bother?
I don't even have a bull anymore.

369
00:34:02,957 --> 00:34:05,126
Thank you very much for today.

370
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:07,628
For helping him go without pain.

371
00:34:10,298 --> 00:34:11,632
Oh, that's right.

372
00:34:11,716 --> 00:34:15,094
Earlier, right before you came,

373
00:34:15,970 --> 00:34:18,806
Ja-young came by and dropped this off.

374
00:34:20,016 --> 00:34:21,768
Did you not see her on your way here?

375
00:34:23,936 --> 00:34:25,021
Officer Ahn?

376
00:34:25,104 --> 00:34:30,902
You were so adorable
playing together in secret back then.

377
00:34:31,611 --> 00:34:36,282
Now the two of you are all grown up.

378
00:34:36,866 --> 00:34:40,661
Since you're here in the village,
you must be seeing her often.

379
00:34:41,537 --> 00:34:43,748
You two are still good friends, right?

380
00:36:12,545 --> 00:36:15,715
Come into the water and play with me.
Aren't you going to come in?

381
00:36:15,798 --> 00:36:17,633
Come on. Join me!

382
00:36:18,426 --> 00:36:19,760
Just come in.

383
00:36:21,053 --> 00:36:23,764
"Once, there was a tree…"

384
00:36:25,224 --> 00:36:29,437
"and she loved a little boy."

385
00:36:31,022 --> 00:36:32,940
It's done. Give me your hand.

386
00:36:43,993 --> 00:36:44,827
There.

387
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:55,338
High-five.

388
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:59,026
SHOWER

389
00:38:06,242 --> 00:38:07,285
Ji-yul.

390
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:57,543
I'M HAN JI-YUL. I'LL COME BACK.
LET'S BE SECRET FRIENDS AGAIN!

391
00:39:43,172 --> 00:39:46,384
Why are you so lukewarm? You were
fussing about being secret friends.

392
00:39:46,467 --> 00:39:49,053
"It's been a long time, so I forgot.
I'm sorry for not remembering."

393
00:39:49,136 --> 00:39:50,346
It's not like I completely forgot.

394
00:39:50,429 --> 00:39:52,139
I just couldn't remember right away.
Why would I be sorry?

395
00:39:52,223 --> 00:39:53,432
Did they fight?

396
00:39:54,016 --> 00:39:56,268
You're right.
You were just kids back then.

397
00:39:56,811 --> 00:39:58,979
In my experience,
if she's not in my line of sight,

398
00:39:59,063 --> 00:40:00,022
I'm bound to be concerned.

399
00:40:00,106 --> 00:40:03,025
Does she look different now that you
think of her as someone you already know?

400
00:40:03,109 --> 00:40:05,403
Aren't people usually like that?

401
00:40:05,486 --> 00:40:09,115
