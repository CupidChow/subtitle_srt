1
00:00:42,083 --> 00:00:42,917
Ahn Ja-young.

2
00:00:44,252 --> 00:00:45,128
Yes?

3
00:00:46,087 --> 00:00:47,297
I'm the same.

4
00:00:48,965 --> 00:00:49,966
What do you mean?

5
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:53,803
I'm the same as any other dude out there.

6
00:00:55,305 --> 00:00:56,181
I like you.

7
00:00:56,848 --> 00:00:57,682
Ahn Ja-young.

8
00:01:23,041 --> 00:01:24,334
Ja-young.

9
00:01:26,795 --> 00:01:27,837
Ja-young.

10
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:30,590
Ja-young!

11
00:01:31,716 --> 00:01:33,259
Oh, hey.

12
00:01:33,885 --> 00:01:35,303
-Have you eaten?
-Yes.

13
00:01:35,386 --> 00:01:36,387
Let's go.

14
00:01:43,478 --> 00:01:44,562
Hello.

15
00:01:44,646 --> 00:01:45,897
Hello.

16
00:01:47,565 --> 00:01:48,441
Hello.

17
00:01:48,525 --> 00:01:50,193
Are you heading to work now?

18
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:52,612
Yes.

19
00:01:58,243 --> 00:02:00,954
I'll get going, then. Have a nice day.

20
00:02:06,835 --> 00:02:08,503
Did something happen?

21
00:02:10,213 --> 00:02:11,131
No.

22
00:02:12,006 --> 00:02:13,216
What's up with him?

23
00:02:51,796 --> 00:02:52,714
Officer Ahn.

24
00:02:55,758 --> 00:02:56,759
Officer Ahn!

25
00:02:57,719 --> 00:02:58,845
Yes, sir.

26
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:00,430
Is something wrong?

27
00:03:00,513 --> 00:03:03,141
No. Why do you ask?

28
00:03:03,224 --> 00:03:05,184
Do you want to go
to the peach farm with me?

29
00:03:06,227 --> 00:03:07,562
Why are you going there?

30
00:03:07,645 --> 00:03:08,938
Don't you want coffee?

31
00:03:10,189 --> 00:03:11,524
Right.

32
00:03:12,525 --> 00:03:13,860
I'm okay.

33
00:03:13,943 --> 00:03:15,987
I don't feel like it right now.

34
00:03:16,779 --> 00:03:19,908
That's odd.
You drink like five cups a day.

35
00:03:20,658 --> 00:03:22,493
-You go ahead.
-Okay, I'll be back.

36
00:03:23,119 --> 00:03:23,995
What's he doing here?

37
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,501
I thought I'd make a delivery
for a change.

38
00:03:34,297 --> 00:03:35,757
SANDEUL POLICE STATION

39
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:48,895
I like you, Ahn Ja-young.

40
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:51,689
What are you doing?

41
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:54,400
I'm confessing.

42
00:03:55,318 --> 00:03:56,236
What?

43
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:58,321
It's become too much to keep bottled up.

44
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:03,910
Look. I…

45
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:06,204
Just like that.

46
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:08,831
Keep thinking about it.

47
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:13,169
I just wanted you to think about it.

48
00:04:16,214 --> 00:04:20,426
For now, that's enough for me.
You don't have to get all serious.

49
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:22,845
I've been around you for your whole life.

50
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:25,515
Try to look at me
from a different perspective.

51
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:27,809
Let's start with that.

52
00:04:32,313 --> 00:04:33,731
Don't look at me like that.

53
00:04:34,524 --> 00:04:36,150
I just wanted to let it all out.

54
00:04:36,985 --> 00:04:38,987
It felt unfair to suffer alone.

55
00:04:48,705 --> 00:04:49,747
Aren't you scared?

56
00:04:51,249 --> 00:04:52,083
Of what?

57
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:55,169
What if we can't even stay friends?

58
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:58,256
I'm not scared.

59
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:02,635
Do you think our relationship can

60
00:05:03,594 --> 00:05:07,140
be defined as simply friends or lovers?

61
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:09,642
I guess not.

62
00:05:12,228 --> 00:05:13,563
Exactly.

63
00:05:14,188 --> 00:05:18,401
To me, you're a friend, but also a woman.

64
00:05:19,235 --> 00:05:21,988
Sometimes you're a little sister,
and sometimes a big sister.

65
00:05:24,949 --> 00:05:27,452
I could even think of you
as an aunt, cousin, and mom.

66
00:05:31,706 --> 00:05:33,958
It would be great
if you were my "special someone."

67
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:37,003
But even if that doesn't happen,
you're still my friend,

68
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:39,630
my neighbor, and my family.

69
00:05:40,965 --> 00:05:43,301
So there's no way
we'll stop seeing each other.

70
00:05:44,635 --> 00:05:46,512
The awkward, uncomfortable phase will be

71
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:50,516
just a short moment compared
to all the time we spent together.

72
00:05:51,309 --> 00:05:52,643
And it'll eventually pass.

73
00:05:55,563 --> 00:05:57,398
We have plenty of time, Ja-young.

74
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,318
Take your time.

75
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:05,907
I mean, aren't I pretty attractive?

76
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:07,617
It's hard to come by
someone this handsome.

77
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:16,459
I'll get going.

78
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:17,668
See you later.

79
00:06:21,172 --> 00:06:22,173
Thanks.

80
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,509
Let's just keep being the usual us.

81
00:06:31,307 --> 00:06:33,101
Have you watched our videos lately?

82
00:06:33,768 --> 00:06:36,020
No, I go straight to bed
and pass out after work.

83
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:39,273
And what do you mean, "our"?
I only helped you out twice.

84
00:06:39,357 --> 00:06:42,860
Hey, do you know how empty I feel
because of those two times?

85
00:06:42,944 --> 00:06:43,778
Do you?

86
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,989
I do my best to explain
and make them laugh,

87
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:50,243
only to see them ask
when you're coming back.

88
00:06:50,326 --> 00:06:51,327
Hey.

89
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:54,747
Let's be honest.
You know I'm pretty good-looking myself.

90
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:57,125
But because of you,
my self-esteem hit rock bottom.

91
00:06:57,208 --> 00:06:58,960
Just tell them I'm not coming back.

92
00:07:00,586 --> 00:07:03,464
What, are you planning
to just settle down over there?

93
00:07:04,215 --> 00:07:05,424
You must be enjoying this.

94
00:07:06,551 --> 00:07:08,719
Hey, what's bothering you this time?

95
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:11,722
Is that nosy police officer
being all nosy again?

96
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:15,768
It's not that.
And why are you suddenly bringing that up?

97
00:07:15,852 --> 00:07:18,229
Man, you must really hate her.

98
00:07:18,312 --> 00:07:19,439
Hey.

99
00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:23,776
I get that you are annoyed
that you have to keep seeing her,

100
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:26,863
but just hang in there.
You're coming back to Seoul soon anyway.

101
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:28,656
Just stick to the basics.

102
00:07:29,323 --> 00:07:31,576
You're good at drawing boundaries.

103
00:07:31,659 --> 00:07:34,495
I am. There's no need to cause
any misunderstanding…

104
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:35,413
Misunderstanding?

105
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:37,832
Hello?

106
00:07:37,915 --> 00:07:40,543
I'm at the barn now.
I'll talk to you later.

107
00:07:46,757 --> 00:07:47,800
SANDEUL POLICE STATION

108
00:07:47,884 --> 00:07:49,177
SANDEUL VILLAGE CULTURE GARDEN

109
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:29,133
When did it start having diarrhea?

110
00:08:29,217 --> 00:08:30,510
About four days ago.

111
00:08:30,593 --> 00:08:33,304
You should give the mother cow less feed,

112
00:08:33,387 --> 00:08:36,098
and you need to clean up
the floor of the barn.

113
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:38,226
And to keep the calf's temperature up,

114
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:39,852
lay down some rice straw…

115
00:08:40,561 --> 00:08:41,437
Ta-da!

116
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:48,194
I went all the way to the peach farm
to get this for you, Little Doctor.

117
00:08:48,277 --> 00:08:49,820
Drink up while it's cold.

118
00:08:50,571 --> 00:08:51,405
Thank you.

119
00:08:51,989 --> 00:08:54,325
Oh, right. Officer Ahn just stopped by.

120
00:08:54,408 --> 00:08:56,827
She wanted to borrow a cage,
so I let her. Is that okay?

121
00:08:57,703 --> 00:08:58,746
Sure.

122
00:08:59,413 --> 00:09:00,373
In that case,

123
00:09:01,415 --> 00:09:02,375
would you come with me?

124
00:09:03,251 --> 00:09:06,295
You think you should go with Mr. Lee.

125
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:08,881
I'm fully booked tomorrow.

126
00:09:11,592 --> 00:09:13,135
I didn't think it through.

127
00:09:13,844 --> 00:09:16,556
I wouldn't want to cause
any misunderstanding.

128
00:09:20,851 --> 00:09:21,769
Was she alone?

129
00:09:22,353 --> 00:09:25,147
She wasn't with Mr. Lee or anyone else?

130
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:26,440
She came alone.

131
00:09:26,524 --> 00:09:30,528
She said she was using her lunchtime
to go to the mountains behind the village.

132
00:09:30,611 --> 00:09:32,947
Apparently, Boksil had puppies there.

133
00:09:35,157 --> 00:09:38,244
Gosh, it's hot. Let's get back inside.

134
00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:42,206
Did she say anything else by any chance?

135
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:44,083
Was she looking for me at all?

136
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:45,334
She wasn't.

137
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:50,006
Oh, she saw the director's bicycle
and fiddled with it a little.

138
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:52,550
She said something was loose
and about to fall out.

139
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:56,637
You see, she's Huidong's MacGyver.

140
00:09:56,721 --> 00:09:59,390
Whatever the problem was,
I'm sure she fixed it.

141
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:03,811
Why did she leave her bicycle here?

142
00:10:04,854 --> 00:10:07,732
You're right. Maybe because of the cage.

143
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:12,236
My, the weather really is beautiful today.

144
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:15,364
It makes me want to drink
some cold bean soup.

145
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:17,199
Let's have bean soup noodles for lunch…

146
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:19,368
What's Officer Ahn's number?

147
00:10:39,722 --> 00:10:41,724
Yes, I'm rescuing animals.

148
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:44,769
I'm just doing my job.

149
00:11:03,621 --> 00:11:04,455
Hey.

150
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:10,670
What happened to you?
Why are you here on your own?

151
00:11:30,981 --> 00:11:32,942
Hey, you came.

152
00:11:37,154 --> 00:11:39,740
Hey, where did you find this one?

153
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:42,201
I looked all over and couldn't find it.

154
00:11:42,743 --> 00:11:45,371
What a relief. Let's get you in the cage.

155
00:11:45,454 --> 00:11:48,124
There you go.

156
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:51,210
Okay, let's get in there.

157
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:56,882
Why are you doing this by yourself?
You should've brought someone.

158
00:11:58,008 --> 00:12:00,636
Well, everyone was busy.

159
00:12:00,719 --> 00:12:02,721
And I thought I could handle

160
00:12:02,805 --> 00:12:06,142
three little puppies on my own.

161
00:12:07,309 --> 00:12:09,437
But I was overconfident.

162
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:12,731
They were quicker than I'd thought.

163
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:17,361
I guess all your help has gone unnoticed.

164
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:19,864
No one's helping you on a day like this.

165
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:25,411
I didn't bother asking for help,
but there are plenty who would be willing.

166
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:28,914
Don't touch the wound.
It might get infected.

167
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:32,960
But seriously, where did you find it?

168
00:12:33,544 --> 00:12:36,046
It must have been hard
to find it in the bushes.

169
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:39,383
It was pretty easy to find.
And it went into the cage by itself.

170
00:12:45,389 --> 00:12:46,849
What was that about?

171
00:12:47,558 --> 00:12:48,976
All right, let's go.

172
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:58,360
The baby is over here, guys. It's okay.

173
00:13:03,365 --> 00:13:05,367
I spoke to Aunt Gang-hwa,

174
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:08,245
and she told me to bring the puppies over.

175
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:10,664
We could put them up for adoption later,

176
00:13:10,748 --> 00:13:14,793
but Boksil is still a bit on edge,
recovering from delivery.

177
00:13:14,877 --> 00:13:16,962
So she doesn't think
we should separate them.

178
00:13:17,046 --> 00:13:20,466
We'll run some quick tests at the hospital
and bring them to her.

179
00:13:22,718 --> 00:13:23,677
Okay.

180
00:13:28,599 --> 00:13:32,228
You left your bicycle at the hospital.
Did you walk all the way here?

181
00:13:37,566 --> 00:13:40,819
I ran into the village head
and got a ride on his truck.

182
00:13:40,903 --> 00:13:42,696
A truck is faster than a bicycle.

183
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:44,865
It's a rescue operation after all.

184
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:57,044
HIS PEACH FARM

185
00:14:03,926 --> 00:14:05,386
Would you like some coffee?

186
00:14:06,804 --> 00:14:08,806
No, I'm good.

187
00:14:08,889 --> 00:14:12,059
I ran the tests.
Luckily, they are all healthy.

188
00:14:13,811 --> 00:14:16,981
They just need to get vaccinated
on schedule.

189
00:14:18,607 --> 00:14:21,026
I guess I could just give them
the first vaccination.

190
00:14:22,945 --> 00:14:24,029
Only the first one?

191
00:14:26,448 --> 00:14:29,994
Right. You have to get back to Seoul.

192
00:14:35,457 --> 00:14:37,334
Anyway, this is great.

193
00:14:37,418 --> 00:14:40,421
Boksil, your babies are all healthy.

194
00:14:44,466 --> 00:14:46,468
I'll let Aunt Gang-hwa know.

195
00:14:48,262 --> 00:14:50,180
Hey, you found each other.

196
00:14:50,764 --> 00:14:53,017
Oh, my gosh. There you are.

197
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:55,561
Aren't they so cute?

198
00:14:55,644 --> 00:14:57,771
Nurungji and Boksil's babies.

199
00:14:58,314 --> 00:15:00,941
Oh, my. When did you two make all these?

200
00:15:01,442 --> 00:15:03,485
My goodness, you look just like your dad.

201
00:15:06,113 --> 00:15:08,532
Well, I'll be going now.

202
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:12,286
Yes, you should.
It looks like it's going to rain soon.

203
00:15:12,369 --> 00:15:14,288
-Have a good one.
-You too.

204
00:15:14,371 --> 00:15:16,373
Wait. I…

205
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:21,253
Never mind.

206
00:15:24,882 --> 00:15:27,301
Let's go, Boksil.

207
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:30,512
My gosh, you're so cute.

208
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:39,188
Let's go.

209
00:15:39,271 --> 00:15:41,273
HAN DEOK-JIN VETERINARY HOSPITAL

210
00:15:41,357 --> 00:15:42,191
Good girl.

211
00:15:42,274 --> 00:15:45,069
HAN DEOK-JIN VETERINARY HOSPITAL

212
00:15:47,821 --> 00:15:50,616
My job being what it is,
I couldn't just ignore it.

213
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:53,786
I'm fine.

214
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:01,543
Occupational habits die hard, don't they?

215
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:05,506
I'm not actually that nosy by nature.

216
00:16:05,589 --> 00:16:08,550
I just have a lot of things to do
as a police officer.

217
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:13,389
So I think you should see it
as dedication to my duty

218
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:16,684
rather than an act of
being nosy or attention-seeking.

219
00:16:16,767 --> 00:16:17,935
You know what I mean?

220
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:24,108
You must have gotten
a new pair of contacts.

221
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:27,361
I was going to refer you to someone
if you hadn't.

222
00:16:27,444 --> 00:16:30,364
There's this optician I'm quite close to.

223
00:16:30,447 --> 00:16:31,699
-If you go to him--
-I know.

224
00:16:31,782 --> 00:16:35,452
I know that you're trying
to take care of me in various ways

225
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:39,331
out of dedication to your job.

226
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:43,085
I'm staying in this village at the moment
after all.

227
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:48,674
I'm saying that I am grateful.

228
00:16:48,757 --> 00:16:50,050
As a temporary resident.

229
00:16:53,178 --> 00:16:56,849
I already got new contacts,
but thank you for your concern.

230
00:16:58,934 --> 00:17:00,853
Are you mad at me about something?

231
00:17:07,276 --> 00:17:08,110
Of course not.

232
00:17:13,574 --> 00:17:14,908
Are you sure?

233
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:19,121
You're not mad at me
for making your bike fall into the paddy?

234
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:22,666
Just how old do you think I am?

235
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:27,880
Thirteen?

236
00:17:35,554 --> 00:17:37,056
Thank you for the treatment.

237
00:17:37,806 --> 00:17:40,142
I better come here again
when I get hurt next time.

238
00:17:40,851 --> 00:17:42,269
You're not too bad.

239
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:47,149
Bye, then.

240
00:17:51,862 --> 00:17:55,532
HAN DEOK-JIN VETERINARY HOSPITAL

241
00:17:58,619 --> 00:17:59,912
Yes, okay.

242
00:18:00,704 --> 00:18:01,622
The 13th?

243
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:04,041
It's going to be difficult.

244
00:18:05,542 --> 00:18:07,127
How about the 21st?

245
00:18:07,836 --> 00:18:08,670
Yes.

246
00:18:09,213 --> 00:18:10,798
The 21st is okay.

247
00:18:15,552 --> 00:18:17,513
Yes, okay.

248
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:18,514
Bye.

249
00:18:29,525 --> 00:18:31,151
THE DAY DIRECTOR HAN IS COMING BACK

250
00:18:34,404 --> 00:18:36,782
-The summer sure feels long, doesn't it?
-It does.

251
00:18:36,865 --> 00:18:38,742
It may feel like you're in exile,

252
00:18:38,826 --> 00:18:40,661
but time will fly
if you keep yourself busy.

253
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:47,584
Oh, no. The ice is all melted.
I told you to drink while it was cold.

254
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:32,671
CALLING…
LEE SANG-HYEON

255
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:56,570
Hello.

256
00:19:56,653 --> 00:20:00,782
It's your cute mascot and the director
of Doctor Choi Animal Hospital,

257
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:04,995
Choi Yun-hyeong.
It's nice to meet you all.

258
00:20:05,746 --> 00:20:08,957
Today, we'll talk about disc disorders,

259
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:13,295
some of the oldest
chronic illnesses for puppies.

260
00:20:13,921 --> 00:20:17,299
WHEN IS DOCTOR HAN JI-YUL APPEARING?
WHERE IS OUR DOCTOR HAN?

261
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:34,942
Man, I hope it doesn't rain too much.

262
00:20:41,782 --> 00:20:43,116
MISSED CALL
JA-YOUNG

263
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:20,320
What's wrong, Seon-dong?

264
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:24,241
The dog ate some chocolate last night.

265
00:21:24,324 --> 00:21:27,494
I'll drop him off and go to the hospital.
Let's talk there.

266
00:21:27,577 --> 00:21:31,164
Doctor, please fix my Ttoli.

267
00:21:31,748 --> 00:21:33,625
-Okay.
-Let's go, Seon-dong.

268
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:44,052
Hey.

269
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:45,470
Is Ttoli okay?

270
00:21:46,513 --> 00:21:49,558
He threw up everything,
so there was nothing left in his stomach.

271
00:21:49,641 --> 00:21:51,643
He'll be all right after some IV fluids.

272
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:56,398
And please tell Seon-dong
never to feed him things like chocolate.

273
00:21:56,982 --> 00:21:59,401
My goodness. He must be worried sick.

274
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:01,111
Is he at school right now?

275
00:22:01,194 --> 00:22:03,739
He was so worried,
he was jumping up and down.

276
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:06,074
Thanks for helping out
so early in the morning.

277
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:08,118
How about Ja-young? Is she okay?

278
00:22:08,201 --> 00:22:10,412
I heard she's at
the Eastern medicine clinic.

279
00:22:10,495 --> 00:22:13,623
I heard she's getting acupuncture
and physical therapy,

280
00:22:13,707 --> 00:22:16,460
but I don't know how she is.
I should go check on her.

281
00:22:18,879 --> 00:22:22,007
Can we have a word, doctor?

282
00:22:39,483 --> 00:22:41,068
She called this morning.

283
00:22:42,152 --> 00:22:45,697
She said she'd fallen pretty hard
and couldn't take Seon-dong to school.

284
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:48,116
The dog was foaming at the mouth
and nearly dying,

285
00:22:48,784 --> 00:22:51,369
so Seon-dong was shocked
and called Ja-young.

286
00:22:52,871 --> 00:22:54,456
Since the boy was crying,

287
00:22:55,499 --> 00:23:00,087
Ja-young ran out in a hurry
and forgot that the bicycle was broken.

288
00:23:02,339 --> 00:23:03,507
Broken bicycle?

289
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:06,218
When yours fell into the rice paddy,

290
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:08,720
a part must have fallen out.

291
00:23:09,304 --> 00:23:12,641
Ja-young probably used
a part from her bicycle to fix yours.

292
00:23:15,018 --> 00:23:15,852
I guess you didn't know.

293
00:23:34,788 --> 00:23:36,206
That's how she is.

294
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:39,209
You know something?

295
00:23:39,793 --> 00:23:42,504
I've been checking the calendar
every day lately.

296
00:23:43,505 --> 00:23:45,966
I'm counting down the days
until you return to Seoul.

297
00:23:48,301 --> 00:23:51,304
Ja-young cares about everything
in this village.

298
00:23:52,639 --> 00:23:56,351
She loves this village
as much as she loves herself.

299
00:23:58,645 --> 00:24:01,940
And I hate that you're
within the boundaries of this village

300
00:24:02,023 --> 00:24:03,733
that she loves so much.

301
00:24:04,901 --> 00:24:07,279
Why? Because you'll be gone soon.

302
00:24:10,031 --> 00:24:12,534
It means that you won't
take responsibility for anything,

303
00:24:13,493 --> 00:24:15,287
and I don't want to see Ja-young

304
00:24:16,496 --> 00:24:18,373
get hurt over something like that again.

305
00:24:22,043 --> 00:24:24,880
It looks like the part you really hate is

306
00:24:25,463 --> 00:24:27,507
how much Officer Ahn cares about me,

307
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:30,343
and that's what you're mad about.

308
00:24:31,511 --> 00:24:32,846
Am I right?

309
00:24:34,723 --> 00:24:35,891
That's not the point.

310
00:24:37,058 --> 00:24:38,643
You'll be gone soon.

311
00:24:38,727 --> 00:24:40,437
That's the part I'm emphasizing.

312
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:45,317
If you'll be gone soon,
don't give her the wrong idea.

313
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:37,369
What brings you here?

314
00:25:47,545 --> 00:25:48,672
What are you doing?

315
00:25:49,589 --> 00:25:53,176
Oh, I was told I had to keep them in
like this for a while, so…

316
00:25:53,969 --> 00:25:56,304
And what are you doing here?

317
00:26:04,229 --> 00:26:05,438
They're from Ms. Jang.

318
00:26:06,189 --> 00:26:07,399
I see.

319
00:26:09,776 --> 00:26:10,986
Thank you.

320
00:26:21,705 --> 00:26:22,831
Are you not hurt enough?

321
00:26:23,623 --> 00:26:24,541
I'm sorry?

322
00:26:24,624 --> 00:26:26,918
Why are you doing that
when you're the patient?

323
00:26:27,627 --> 00:26:29,879
Is there no one else
that can cut those things?

324
00:26:30,463 --> 00:26:33,508
-Well, I just--
-Are you a robot? Do you have superpowers?

325
00:26:34,426 --> 00:26:37,887
If you're injured, you should
lie down and rest so you can heal.

326
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:39,973
Don't you know this is self-abuse?

327
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:44,394
It's not healthy to seek
reaffirmation of your self-worth

328
00:26:44,978 --> 00:26:46,563
from constantly helping others.

329
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:49,816
Do you need people to thank you
that badly?

330
00:26:50,483 --> 00:26:53,236
Why would you sacrifice yourself
for something so stupid?

331
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:54,362
Look, Mr. Han Ji-yul.

332
00:26:54,446 --> 00:26:57,532
So why did you have to fix my bicycle
in the first place

333
00:26:58,366 --> 00:27:00,118
and end up getting hurt?

334
00:27:00,744 --> 00:27:02,662
Why did you do something I never asked

335
00:27:03,747 --> 00:27:07,334
and make me feel indebted?
It makes me feel so uncomfortable.

336
00:27:10,712 --> 00:27:11,671
You're right.

337
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:15,550
"Thank you, I appreciate it."
That's what l live for.

338
00:27:16,176 --> 00:27:18,219
So what? What's wrong with that?

339
00:27:18,803 --> 00:27:22,140
If I could be appreciated like that,
who cares if I hurt myself a little?

340
00:27:52,587 --> 00:27:57,050
HAN DEOK-JIN VETERINARY HOSPITAL

341
00:28:12,941 --> 00:28:14,192
Doctor Han.

342
00:28:19,614 --> 00:28:23,618
SANDEUL POLICE STATION

343
00:28:32,585 --> 00:28:33,461
Jeez.

344
00:28:34,963 --> 00:28:35,964
Oh, hey.

345
00:28:37,966 --> 00:28:40,927
Why did you come in?
I told you I'd give you sick leave.

346
00:28:41,010 --> 00:28:42,345
It's not like I can't walk.

347
00:28:42,429 --> 00:28:45,265
How are you going to go on patrols
with a limp like that?

348
00:28:45,348 --> 00:28:48,017
You'll make the residents feel uneasy.

349
00:28:48,101 --> 00:28:51,563
Jeong-sik and Geun-mo will
go on the patrols, so go home.

350
00:28:51,646 --> 00:28:53,940
This kind of injury only improves
with lying down and resting.

351
00:28:54,023 --> 00:28:58,987
Then let me do some office work.
I have to do something right now.

352
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:01,406
-Hey, Geun-mo.
-Hey, go rest. Let's go.

353
00:29:01,489 --> 00:29:02,907
Please, Chief.

354
00:29:04,492 --> 00:29:06,494
Hey, I'm really fine.

355
00:29:06,578 --> 00:29:10,915
Take care of yourself
so I can work you for a long time. Gosh.

356
00:29:12,375 --> 00:29:14,002
Go start the car already.

357
00:29:16,171 --> 00:29:17,088
It's cold.

358
00:29:21,217 --> 00:29:23,553
Which idiot forgot to roll up the window?

359
00:29:23,636 --> 00:29:26,306
It was actually you, Chief.
You said it was too hot.

360
00:29:27,223 --> 00:29:28,683
Get in.

361
00:29:30,477 --> 00:29:31,352
All right.

362
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:33,271
-Hey, Geun-mo.
-Yes, sir.

363
00:29:33,354 --> 00:29:36,232
After dropping her off,
go check in on Pyeong-sik's.

364
00:29:36,316 --> 00:29:38,067
It's a disaster there when it rains.

365
00:29:38,151 --> 00:29:39,152
Yes, sir.

366
00:29:40,528 --> 00:29:41,946
I don't know what's going on with you,

367
00:29:42,530 --> 00:29:44,991
but working won't make you
feel any better.

368
00:29:45,575 --> 00:29:48,119
Go get some sleep and shake it off, okay?

369
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,538
-Okay.
-Go.

370
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:51,456
Yes, sir.

371
00:29:57,879 --> 00:29:59,589
I like the sound of the rain.

372
00:30:03,593 --> 00:30:07,180
I'll drop you off after the rounds then.
Get some shut-eye.

373
00:30:08,306 --> 00:30:09,390
Okay.

374
00:30:15,605 --> 00:30:19,818
Sang-hyeon told me,
but I wanted to see with my own eyes.

375
00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:22,529
-He's really okay now, right?
-Yes.

376
00:30:23,196 --> 00:30:25,698
He's done with the fluids,
so you could take him home.

377
00:30:25,782 --> 00:30:27,617
But it's raining too much, isn't it?

378
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:30,870
Right, and I have to stop
by the school supply shop.

379
00:30:30,954 --> 00:30:34,123
-Can I pick him up tomorrow after school?
-Of course.

380
00:30:34,207 --> 00:30:37,210
Then please look after my Ttoli
for one more day.

381
00:30:37,836 --> 00:30:38,711
Okay.

382
00:30:38,795 --> 00:30:41,923
By the way, Doctor,
did Ja-young do something wrong?

383
00:30:42,632 --> 00:30:43,508
What?

384
00:30:43,591 --> 00:30:47,095
She said hi yesterday morning,
and you just walked off.

385
00:30:48,304 --> 00:30:49,472
I said hi back.

386
00:30:49,556 --> 00:30:51,015
But your face didn't say hi.

387
00:30:51,099 --> 00:30:54,018
Admit it. You're mad at her, right?

388
00:30:56,688 --> 00:30:58,565
No way. Not at all.

389
00:31:01,317 --> 00:31:02,735
I really am not mad at her.

390
00:31:02,819 --> 00:31:05,321
Even if you're mad at her,

391
00:31:05,405 --> 00:31:07,156
can't you just give her a break?

392
00:31:09,033 --> 00:31:10,702
I mean, that's…

393
00:31:10,785 --> 00:31:13,037
Ja-young is a really nice person.

394
00:31:13,121 --> 00:31:16,374
She's as nice as my grandma.

395
00:31:16,457 --> 00:31:18,918
She might have done something
to make you angry,

396
00:31:19,002 --> 00:31:21,713
but she always means well.

397
00:31:21,796 --> 00:31:23,715
Could you please stop being mad at her?

398
00:31:30,346 --> 00:31:31,973
Ja-young didn't do anything wrong.

399
00:31:32,724 --> 00:31:35,059
-If anything, I did something wrong.
-Really?

400
00:31:35,643 --> 00:31:36,728
What did you do wrong?

401
00:31:40,523 --> 00:31:42,317
I got mad at her,

402
00:31:43,359 --> 00:31:45,403
-when I should have been thanking her.
-Why?

403
00:31:47,113 --> 00:31:49,490
That's what I'm asking myself.
I was so stupid.

404
00:31:51,492 --> 00:31:55,288
Gosh, I envy her.
She has so many people who care about her.

405
00:31:57,582 --> 00:31:59,250
-You want some hot chocolate?
-Yes.

406
00:31:59,334 --> 00:32:00,209
Okay.

407
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:03,796
Doctor!

408
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:08,968
Hey, Seon-dong.

409
00:32:09,594 --> 00:32:11,137
Tell her you're sorry.

410
00:32:11,888 --> 00:32:14,015
Were you worried about me?

411
00:32:15,516 --> 00:32:18,311
I'm totally fine, so don't worry.

412
00:32:18,394 --> 00:32:22,190
I'll be heading back home
after I visit Mr. Pyeong-sik's place.

413
00:32:22,857 --> 00:32:24,067
By the way, where are you?

414
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:32,533
Hello?

415
00:32:37,288 --> 00:32:38,456
Officer Ahn.

416
00:32:42,669 --> 00:32:45,880
My gosh, what a scary downpour.

417
00:32:45,964 --> 00:32:50,009
SANDEUL POLICE STATION

418
00:32:55,932 --> 00:32:57,684
Yes, this is Sandeul precinct--

419
00:33:44,564 --> 00:33:45,898
Sergeant Yoon.

420
00:33:51,529 --> 00:33:52,447
Officer Ahn.

421
00:33:53,156 --> 00:33:54,198
Officer Ahn!

422
00:33:54,741 --> 00:33:55,908
Wake up!

423
00:34:12,508 --> 00:34:13,468
Officer Ahn!

424
00:34:20,183 --> 00:34:21,100
Officer Ahn!

425
00:34:21,726 --> 00:34:23,519
Officer Ahn, wake up!

426
00:34:23,603 --> 00:34:24,604
Wake up!

427
00:34:24,687 --> 00:34:25,563
Come on.

428
00:34:34,405 --> 00:34:37,784
Officer Ahn! Wake up, please!

429
00:34:56,511 --> 00:34:58,137
Hey! Open the door, kid!

430
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:31,504
I took pity on you
because you have no parents.

431
00:35:31,587 --> 00:35:33,714
Why do you always take Huidong's side?

432
00:35:33,798 --> 00:35:34,882
That's enough!

433
00:35:35,758 --> 00:35:38,344
What can I do for you?
Do you want a cooler full of beer?

434
00:35:38,427 --> 00:35:40,388
Jeez, you punk.

435
00:35:41,472 --> 00:35:43,975
You miss them, don't you?
Your mom and dad.

436
00:35:44,058 --> 00:35:47,395
You were so adorable
playing together in secret.

437
00:35:47,478 --> 00:35:50,731
I'm sorry I didn't recognize you
right away.

438
00:35:50,815 --> 00:35:51,941
I wonder where he went.

439
00:35:52,024 --> 00:35:56,779
