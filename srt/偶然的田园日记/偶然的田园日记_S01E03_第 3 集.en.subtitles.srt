1
00:00:43,752 --> 00:00:45,837
My goodness,
this isn't even worth that much.

2
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:49,507
-Jeez.
-Doctor. I'm sorry.

3
00:00:49,591 --> 00:00:51,718
He's usually a good kid.

4
00:00:51,801 --> 00:00:53,052
It's all my fault.

5
00:00:53,136 --> 00:00:54,554
What's wrong with you, kid?

6
00:00:54,637 --> 00:00:56,973
-You little brat!
-Stop.

7
00:00:57,056 --> 00:00:59,517
He says he did it
to buy a gift for his GF.

8
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:01,352
His GF?

9
00:01:01,436 --> 00:01:04,439
You stole money to buy
some stupid gift for your GF?

10
00:01:04,522 --> 00:01:06,149
You idiot.

11
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:10,695
You're Ju-ho's friend, right?

12
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:16,159
And you stole this from
the Young Men's Association president?

13
00:01:17,535 --> 00:01:19,454
That was my first time.

14
00:01:19,537 --> 00:01:21,998
I was going to stop at 200,000 won, but…

15
00:01:22,582 --> 00:01:25,085
Why would you buy your goldfish
a 200,000 won gift?

16
00:01:25,168 --> 00:01:27,962
Chief, it's actually
short for "girlfriend."

17
00:01:28,046 --> 00:01:30,006
So it was for his girlfriend?

18
00:01:30,089 --> 00:01:32,383
Still, you little brat.

19
00:01:32,967 --> 00:01:36,346
Regardless of the amount,
it still counts as theft.

20
00:01:36,429 --> 00:01:38,515
Did you feel safer
stealing from another neighborhood?

21
00:01:39,432 --> 00:01:40,266
I'm sorry.

22
00:01:40,892 --> 00:01:42,769
What about the director's house?

23
00:01:43,853 --> 00:01:45,438
I didn't take anything from there.

24
00:01:45,522 --> 00:01:48,608
I didn't even get a proper look around.
I'm telling the truth.

25
00:01:51,611 --> 00:01:53,196
Well, the thing is…

26
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:56,491
I'm not really sure
what's missing in the house…

27
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,578
But I don't recognize any of those items.

28
00:02:00,662 --> 00:02:01,955
That's a relief.

29
00:02:06,251 --> 00:02:07,168
Alright then.

30
00:02:07,752 --> 00:02:11,297
Now we're going to question you
about the thefts that we're aware of.

31
00:02:11,381 --> 00:02:14,884
So you have to be honest
when you tell us in detail

32
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:17,303
about how much and from where you stole.

33
00:02:18,638 --> 00:02:21,641
Doctor, please finish your statement.
You, come this way.

34
00:02:21,724 --> 00:02:22,725
Okay.

35
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:24,811
-Oh, gosh.
-All this over some birthday gift?

36
00:02:24,894 --> 00:02:25,812
Goodness.

37
00:02:26,396 --> 00:02:29,732
Shouldn't you talk to that Ju-ho kid too?

38
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:32,318
He might have been in on it as well.

39
00:02:33,111 --> 00:02:35,155
-What?
-Isn't that right?

40
00:02:35,238 --> 00:02:36,281
You're right!

41
00:02:36,364 --> 00:02:38,408
She's right.

42
00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:41,411
Don't look the other way
just because he's from Huidong.

43
00:02:41,494 --> 00:02:44,164
He stole from this village
not to get caught,

44
00:02:44,247 --> 00:02:47,041
but how could he have known
his way around town?

45
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:51,004
Someone must have tipped him off.

46
00:02:51,087 --> 00:02:53,923
Come on, Ms. Park. That's absurd.

47
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:56,134
Ju-ho and Gi-taek go to school here.

48
00:02:56,217 --> 00:02:57,468
They know their way around…

49
00:02:58,761 --> 00:03:00,054
You tell us.

50
00:03:00,138 --> 00:03:02,223
Were you and Ju-ho in on this together?

51
00:03:05,727 --> 00:03:09,147
If you ask him directly like that,
do you seriously think he'd say,

52
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:11,065
"Yes, we did it together"?

53
00:03:11,149 --> 00:03:14,485
He might be big,
but he's still only a child, you know.

54
00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:16,654
Friends mean everything at that age!

55
00:03:18,156 --> 00:03:20,575
My goodness.
How did those ladies find out about this?

56
00:03:20,658 --> 00:03:21,868
Let me see him.

57
00:03:21,951 --> 00:03:24,871
How on earth did you even find out?

58
00:03:24,954 --> 00:03:29,334
Nothing can ever happen
in this village without me knowing.

59
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:34,047
I ran over here
when I heard they caught the thief.

60
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:36,758
Who knew it would be a Majeong resident?

61
00:03:36,841 --> 00:03:38,384
That's low.

62
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:41,137
A kid takes some chump change
and you call him a thief?

63
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:44,057
So in Majeong,
if you sneak into people's houses

64
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:46,893
and go through their things,
you're not a thief?

65
00:03:46,976 --> 00:03:49,437
That is one magnanimous village.

66
00:03:50,104 --> 00:03:51,105
Well, it makes sense.

67
00:03:51,189 --> 00:03:54,400
They're shameless enough
to snatch municipal support funds.

68
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:57,028
Their whole village is a little…

69
00:03:57,111 --> 00:03:58,613
you-know-what, am I right?

70
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:03,993
You think you got one on me now?

71
00:04:04,786 --> 00:04:07,956
Why are you bringing up
the support funds right now?

72
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:10,208
She's not wrong.

73
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:12,669
You knew
we'd been working on it for years,

74
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:16,089
but once the notice was posted,
you suddenly jumped right on it.

75
00:04:16,172 --> 00:04:17,966
Stay out of it, sidekick!

76
00:04:18,049 --> 00:04:20,468
Hey, why are you lashing out at her?

77
00:04:20,551 --> 00:04:24,264
Do you not know what you're here for?
What's with the attitude?

78
00:04:24,347 --> 00:04:25,765
Aren't you ashamed?

79
00:04:25,848 --> 00:04:28,142
I didn't steal anything.
Why should I be ashamed?

80
00:04:28,226 --> 00:04:32,522
But you're the village representative
and your village produced a thief.

81
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:33,564
Why, you little…

82
00:04:35,066 --> 00:04:37,694
-I'll be going now.
-How would you like this handled?

83
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:38,987
Is that what you're saying?

84
00:04:40,363 --> 00:04:41,656
Will you press charges?

85
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:52,709
That's right.

86
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:54,585
Right.

87
00:04:55,503 --> 00:04:57,547
Tell us, Doctor Han, what will you do?

88
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:00,800
-What do you mean?
-What are you going to do about this?

89
00:05:00,883 --> 00:05:03,052
Someone broke into
your grandparents' house.

90
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:06,431
He was caught at the scene,
but if he hadn't,

91
00:05:06,514 --> 00:05:08,725
who knows what could have been stolen?

92
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:13,479
Don't you think
he should be punished for what he did?

93
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:18,901
Not really, since nothing's gone missing.

94
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:20,570
And he seems to be repenting.

95
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:22,530
You should ask the other victims.

96
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:30,663
See? This is called common sense.

97
00:05:31,247 --> 00:05:34,042
Coming down on a kid
and trying to convict him

98
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:37,378
for stealing some petty cash is
just too harsh.

99
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:42,675
My goodness, you sure are well-educated.

100
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:46,763
You know Director Han does house calls
to our village as well, right?

101
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:50,224
I could tell he was a good man
from the beginning.

102
00:05:50,808 --> 00:05:54,562
Why don't you just move to our village?

103
00:05:54,645 --> 00:05:57,607
If we get the funds
for specialized livestock industry,

104
00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:00,109
it would be a jackpot
for your veterinary hospital.

105
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:02,278
Well, I'm okay.

106
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:09,702
You can't try to tempt him with something
that hasn't even happened.

107
00:06:09,786 --> 00:06:12,747
He's one of us Huidong residents.

108
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:14,665
And your village might have a chance

109
00:06:14,749 --> 00:06:17,752
only after we get our funds
for specialization of our peaches.

110
00:06:17,835 --> 00:06:19,921
You're jumping to conclusions

111
00:06:20,004 --> 00:06:21,506
before your business plan is done!

112
00:06:21,589 --> 00:06:24,383
A man follows his work, all right?

113
00:06:24,467 --> 00:06:27,512
He wasn't born or raised here.
A Huidong resident, my foot!

114
00:06:27,595 --> 00:06:29,305
All right. Let go of me first.

115
00:06:29,388 --> 00:06:30,473
Hello, excuse me.

116
00:06:31,307 --> 00:06:33,601
Are you seeing anyone by any chance?

117
00:06:34,435 --> 00:06:36,854
I have a niece who's really pretty.

118
00:06:36,938 --> 00:06:38,439
She's so pretty that--

119
00:06:45,822 --> 00:06:47,156
Oh, my world.

120
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,158
Seriously? Your niece?

121
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:52,662
Are you talking about that niece
who we've all seen?

122
00:06:52,745 --> 00:06:54,038
You really have no shame!

123
00:06:54,122 --> 00:06:55,039
No shame!

124
00:06:55,123 --> 00:06:56,916
Hey! What's wrong with her face?

125
00:06:56,999 --> 00:06:58,417
Watch what you say.

126
00:06:59,127 --> 00:07:02,338
I mean, why would he go all the way there
to find a woman?

127
00:07:02,421 --> 00:07:05,466
Huidong has plenty of beauties, right?

128
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:08,469
-Where? Let me see one.
-Somewhere very close, right here.

129
00:07:09,178 --> 00:07:10,972
First, we have Officer Ahn.

130
00:07:11,055 --> 00:07:12,807
Yes, Officer Ahn.

131
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:14,433
My goodness, are you serious?

132
00:07:14,517 --> 00:07:17,687
She's nothing compared to my niece!

133
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:20,565
Your niece's face is a total wreck
just like yours!

134
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:39,667
Jeez…

135
00:07:55,349 --> 00:08:00,146
I have no intention of
being roped into your fight.

136
00:08:00,229 --> 00:08:01,731
And I have a girlfriend!

137
00:08:02,607 --> 00:08:06,652
Huidong or Majeong, I have no intention
of meeting anyone and settling down.

138
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:11,866
So leave me out of your regional conflict.

139
00:08:17,955 --> 00:08:19,707
Stay away from each other!

140
00:08:22,793 --> 00:08:23,711
Would you just…

141
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:28,216
Mr. Han!

142
00:08:32,053 --> 00:08:34,055
-Get in.
-Are you offering me a ride?

143
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:37,475
You are a victim,
and your house is a mess.

144
00:08:37,558 --> 00:08:39,519
Cleaning up scenes is
also a part of our job.

145
00:08:39,602 --> 00:08:41,521
-Your job?
-Pardon?

146
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:45,691
What do you mean?

147
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:48,110
I'm asking if you have
any personal feelings for me

148
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:51,697
or if someone put you up to this

149
00:08:52,281 --> 00:08:53,991
because I seem to run into you often.

150
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:57,036
Way too often.

151
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:00,581
That's ridiculous.

152
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:04,085
You must have very high self-esteem.

153
00:09:04,168 --> 00:09:05,545
Being in this village helped.

154
00:09:06,128 --> 00:09:07,046
Never mind.

155
00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:10,550
And as for cleaning up,
I'd rather do it on my own.

156
00:09:12,468 --> 00:09:14,845
Why do you hate this village so much?

157
00:09:15,429 --> 00:09:18,558
You hate it when we give you things
or try to be nice.

158
00:09:18,641 --> 00:09:20,393
Your grandparents live here,

159
00:09:20,476 --> 00:09:22,645
and I don't see
any reason to hate it here.

160
00:09:22,728 --> 00:09:24,814
I mean, it's not your first time here.

161
00:09:25,439 --> 00:09:28,359
Don't you maybe have
one or two good memories?

162
00:09:28,442 --> 00:09:30,528
I never said I hated it.

163
00:09:32,154 --> 00:09:34,115
But come to think of it, I do.

164
00:09:34,198 --> 00:09:35,199
I do hate it.

165
00:09:40,997 --> 00:09:44,584
I hate this village,
and I have no good memories of it.

166
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:47,503
I just want to have some boundaries,

167
00:09:48,212 --> 00:09:50,548
but no one here seems to understand that.

168
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:55,428
Look, Mr. Han.

169
00:09:56,721 --> 00:09:57,930
Do you really not…

170
00:10:04,729 --> 00:10:05,563
Never mind.

171
00:10:06,772 --> 00:10:07,898
Go on home then.

172
00:10:28,252 --> 00:10:30,254
Are you thinking about
what to eat tomorrow?

173
00:10:31,505 --> 00:10:33,633
I've already decided that.

174
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:37,345
How far back do you remember your life?

175
00:10:37,928 --> 00:10:39,513
Do you remember elementary school?

176
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:41,390
Vaguely.

177
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:43,851
I remember most of sixth grade.

178
00:10:45,853 --> 00:10:49,023
I remember how I got lost
at the market when I was eight.

179
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:51,859
I got spanked so much.

180
00:10:53,944 --> 00:10:57,323
Significant memories like that are
still pretty clear.

181
00:10:57,406 --> 00:11:00,242
Right? So it's not just me.

182
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:03,329
I can't remember everything,

183
00:11:03,412 --> 00:11:06,749
but I remember really happy moments
and really bad ones pretty clearly.

184
00:11:08,584 --> 00:11:09,710
But apparently,

185
00:11:09,794 --> 00:11:12,213
people can remember the same moment
very differently.

186
00:11:16,842 --> 00:11:18,844
Maybe it was just me.

187
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:27,603
Are you talking about your mother?

188
00:11:28,479 --> 00:11:29,313
What?

189
00:11:33,484 --> 00:11:34,652
That too.

190
00:11:34,735 --> 00:11:37,780
I guess I'm mostly happy by myself.

191
00:11:38,656 --> 00:11:41,826
I've held on to those happy memories

192
00:11:41,909 --> 00:11:44,078
when the other person
doesn't even remember.

193
00:11:45,287 --> 00:11:47,873
Maybe I've lived too long in a village
that never changes.

194
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:50,126
It's kind of funny.

195
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:02,430
I remember everything.

196
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:09,019
I'm the one person who shares
the most memories with you.

197
00:12:12,064 --> 00:12:14,817
There isn't a memory I can't remember.

198
00:12:16,986 --> 00:12:19,822
So you're not the weird one
for remembering stuff.

199
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:27,204
You're right. I have a lot more memories
with you than anyone else.

200
00:12:28,539 --> 00:12:29,790
You're right.

201
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:32,126
You dummy.

202
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:49,143
I did it. It's not sticky anymore.

203
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:53,105
Man, that homemade booze…
Am I drunk from the smell?

204
00:12:59,153 --> 00:13:00,029
What?

205
00:13:00,112 --> 00:13:01,197
What do you mean, "what"?

206
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,199
I called to check if you got the package.

207
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:04,575
And if you were still alive.

208
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,620
Yes, I got it.

209
00:13:08,412 --> 00:13:10,498
It was a ridiculous package as I expected,

210
00:13:10,581 --> 00:13:12,291
but thank you.

211
00:13:13,542 --> 00:13:16,545
Why are you still breathing like that?

212
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:18,005
What have you been doing?

213
00:13:18,756 --> 00:13:23,385
Me? I vaccinated 150 pigs,
intubated a goat's airway,

214
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:26,388
made routine visits to three barns,
had the house burglarized,

215
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:28,766
and just finished cleaning up
the mess from that.

216
00:13:29,433 --> 00:13:30,684
And I got rid of someone.

217
00:13:30,768 --> 00:13:33,395
Wait. "Burglarized"?
Did you say you got burglarized?

218
00:13:34,396 --> 00:13:35,564
Life is spectacular.

219
00:13:36,565 --> 00:13:37,900
What the heck, man?

220
00:13:37,983 --> 00:13:40,819
And what do you mean
you got rid of someone?

221
00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:44,406
There's this super nosy person.

222
00:13:45,157 --> 00:13:46,408
And she's extremely rude.

223
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:48,118
A nosy person?

224
00:13:49,745 --> 00:13:52,915
So you have someone like me down there?

225
00:13:52,998 --> 00:13:55,000
I suddenly feel very relieved, you know?

226
00:13:55,709 --> 00:13:59,171
Knowing that there's someone
to annoy you on the regular.

227
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:01,423
Having fun?

228
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:05,511
Hey, you manage to make
an enemy or two wherever you go.

229
00:14:05,594 --> 00:14:08,597
Isn't that why you've honed
your callousness?

230
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:13,686
You said you got rid of someone.
You must have done your thing already.

231
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:18,065
What, are you regretting it now?

232
00:14:18,148 --> 00:14:22,945
I guess someone like me does raise
that kind of emotion from you.

233
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:27,241
Someone who keeps bothering you
and makes you think about them, you know?

234
00:14:28,325 --> 00:14:30,619
How harsh were you on this person?

235
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:31,829
Is it a woman?

236
00:14:33,831 --> 00:14:34,874
Hello?

237
00:14:37,126 --> 00:14:38,127
Hello?

238
00:14:38,836 --> 00:14:41,130
Hey, Han Ji-yul. Did you fall asleep?

239
00:14:42,172 --> 00:14:44,300
Are you asleep?
Wow, you really fell asleep…

240
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:46,093
Hey.

241
00:14:46,176 --> 00:14:47,887
Okay, sleep tight.

242
00:14:58,063 --> 00:15:00,649
Did I pass out?

243
00:15:29,511 --> 00:15:30,763
Ja-young.

244
00:15:30,846 --> 00:15:33,599
Hey, Kim Seon-dong, the model citizen!

245
00:15:35,351 --> 00:15:37,144
Sang-hyeon says you caught the thief.

246
00:15:37,227 --> 00:15:40,105
That's right, thanks to you,
our village has been saved.

247
00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:42,399
Keep it up, Mr. Model Citizen.

248
00:15:43,651 --> 00:15:44,902
Get on.

249
00:15:49,823 --> 00:15:50,699
Let's go.

250
00:15:51,283 --> 00:15:52,493
Let's go.

251
00:15:56,705 --> 00:15:57,665
Good morning.

252
00:15:58,916 --> 00:15:59,917
Hi.

253
00:16:01,085 --> 00:16:04,630
For your information,
I'm not here because of you.

254
00:16:04,713 --> 00:16:06,298
And I didn't cross any boundaries.

255
00:16:06,882 --> 00:16:09,635
I'm just helping him get to school, okay?

256
00:16:09,718 --> 00:16:11,887
-What?
-Have a good one.

257
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:13,555
Hey, wait…

258
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:31,907
Did you have a fight with Doctor Han?

259
00:16:33,033 --> 00:16:34,576
No, why?

260
00:16:35,077 --> 00:16:38,330
Well, it's because
your lips look like a straight line.

261
00:16:39,123 --> 00:16:43,335
Like the Chinese character for one?
You must be studying Chinese characters.

262
00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:45,587
I don't need to study to know that.

263
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:48,716
Don't fight.
It tires me out to see grown-ups fight.

264
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:50,509
We didn't fight.

265
00:16:51,135 --> 00:16:54,054
I'm just trying to leave him alone
as much as possible.

266
00:16:54,138 --> 00:16:55,723
That's what Doctor Han wants.

267
00:16:56,348 --> 00:16:58,350
He's only here for a little while,

268
00:16:58,434 --> 00:17:00,853
so we should make him feel
as comfortable as possible.

269
00:17:00,936 --> 00:17:04,732
My dad always tells my mom
to leave him alone.

270
00:17:04,815 --> 00:17:06,150
Is it something like that?

271
00:17:06,233 --> 00:17:08,193
That didn't seem very nice.

272
00:17:08,986 --> 00:17:10,279
Goodness.

273
00:17:13,323 --> 00:17:16,285
Yes, I am in Majeong now,

274
00:17:16,785 --> 00:17:18,662
but the GPS isn't working again.

275
00:17:20,164 --> 00:17:20,998
Yes.

276
00:17:22,124 --> 00:17:23,125
Yes, okay.

277
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:38,557
Hello. Nice seeing you again.

278
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:39,475
Hello.

279
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:42,394
-Are you here for a house call?
-Yes.

280
00:17:44,354 --> 00:17:46,356
I came here with Officer Ahn,

281
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,901
but I'm going back first
because the chief summoned me.

282
00:17:49,485 --> 00:17:50,736
I'll get going then.

283
00:17:52,112 --> 00:17:52,946
Have a good one.

284
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:55,532
Well, I didn't ask…

285
00:18:27,231 --> 00:18:30,192
How did he cover
this distance on a bicycle?

286
00:18:31,068 --> 00:18:32,778
Grandpa is impressive.

287
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:36,323
Officer Ahn.

288
00:18:40,202 --> 00:18:41,411
What brings you here?

289
00:18:42,704 --> 00:18:45,290
Did Jang Se-ryeon ask you
to snoop on us or something?

290
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:47,793
Come on, Ms. Park.

291
00:18:47,876 --> 00:18:50,420
I was just checking in on Gi-taek.

292
00:18:51,004 --> 00:18:53,173
It's hot out, so take it easy, okay?

293
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:56,802
Have you heard from your mother yet?

294
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:01,014
Gosh, I guess not. I can't believe her.

295
00:19:01,598 --> 00:19:04,309
How could she live her life
after abandoning her child?

296
00:19:04,393 --> 00:19:06,019
I just don't understand.

297
00:19:06,103 --> 00:19:08,355
She won't even come looking for
such a pretty daughter.

298
00:19:08,438 --> 00:19:12,192
What? I'm just saying.
She's like a niece to me.

299
00:19:14,027 --> 00:19:17,072
I figured she'd at least drop by
once things got better.

300
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:20,868
But if she hasn't shown up yet,
it must mean she's still struggling.

301
00:19:21,451 --> 00:19:25,414
Don't let it bother you.
You're a tough one, aren't you?

302
00:19:26,957 --> 00:19:30,419
I'm not bothered. Everyone in the village
treats me like I'm their daughter.

303
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:34,131
I'm not sad at all.
Thank you for your concerns.

304
00:19:35,424 --> 00:19:39,011
Good. Who wouldn't want
such a nice daughter like you?

305
00:19:40,137 --> 00:19:44,600
Your mother is so terrible.
I can't believe her.

306
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:48,437
What? Doctor Han, you were here too?

307
00:19:49,104 --> 00:19:53,025
I don't know if you heard me,
but don't get the wrong idea.

308
00:19:53,525 --> 00:19:57,905
It's not her fault
that her mom hasn't come to see her.

309
00:19:58,739 --> 00:20:00,490
Isn't that right, Officer Ahn?

310
00:20:04,119 --> 00:20:04,995
I'll be going now.

311
00:20:05,078 --> 00:20:08,040
Okay, don't let it bother you!

312
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:35,943
Get on. It's hot out.

313
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:44,368
It's okay, I can walk.

314
00:20:45,994 --> 00:20:47,663
It's too far.

315
00:20:48,997 --> 00:20:51,124
I can just carry this backpack,

316
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:54,002
and I can…

317
00:20:54,962 --> 00:20:56,755
carry this too, so get on.

318
00:20:56,838 --> 00:20:59,007
It's really fine. I'll just walk alone.

319
00:21:05,472 --> 00:21:06,890
That's not the way!

320
00:21:06,974 --> 00:21:09,643
There's a shortcut. Bye.

321
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:35,294
Hello?

322
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:37,629
I'm on my way.

323
00:22:39,066 --> 00:22:41,276
That place is notorious
for having bad coffee.

324
00:22:41,359 --> 00:22:42,402
Did you go into town?

325
00:22:43,111 --> 00:22:43,945
Yes.

326
00:22:45,405 --> 00:22:46,990
Listen.

327
00:22:47,491 --> 00:22:50,660
You said that my grandfather
often borrowed a truck.

328
00:22:50,744 --> 00:22:52,329
Where did he borrow it from?

329
00:22:52,412 --> 00:22:55,165
He usually borrowed it
from the head of the village.

330
00:22:55,248 --> 00:22:57,709
They have a few trucks,
so there's always one available.

331
00:22:58,627 --> 00:23:02,047
The head of the village?
The peach farm place, right?

332
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:04,007
Right, Sang-hyeon's house.

333
00:23:04,091 --> 00:23:06,510
Sang-hyeon is his son.

334
00:23:07,803 --> 00:23:09,137
And about Officer Ahn…

335
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:10,263
What about Ja-young?

336
00:23:12,641 --> 00:23:13,683
Never mind.

337
00:23:23,819 --> 00:23:25,570
He's started eating?

338
00:23:26,154 --> 00:23:27,239
Since when?

339
00:23:27,322 --> 00:23:30,075
This is the first time.

340
00:23:30,992 --> 00:23:35,247
Well, what can he do?
He's got to adapt to survive, right?

341
00:24:11,992 --> 00:24:14,786
HIS PEACH FARM

342
00:24:20,208 --> 00:24:22,002
1. PICK A CUP
2. FILL IT WITH ICE TO YOUR LIKING

343
00:24:22,085 --> 00:24:24,462
3. PLACE CUP UNDER FAUCET
4. PRESS "START" AND YOU HAVE COFFEE!

344
00:24:24,546 --> 00:24:25,630
REFILL MACHINE WITH BEANS IF EMPTY

345
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:34,681
What brings you here?

346
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:36,516
Well, I…

347
00:24:37,601 --> 00:24:39,269
Ja-young, you're here!

348
00:24:40,353 --> 00:24:44,065
I see you brought help as well. Good job.

349
00:24:44,149 --> 00:24:45,483
No, that's not it, Auntie--

350
00:24:45,567 --> 00:24:49,404
Gosh, it's a disaster.
We need all the help we can get.

351
00:24:49,487 --> 00:24:51,573
If the stink bugs spread,
it'll be all ruined.

352
00:24:51,656 --> 00:24:54,284
Hurry up and get in there.
I have to go pee real quick.

353
00:24:54,367 --> 00:24:55,452
Wait, Auntie.

354
00:25:13,011 --> 00:25:13,845
Auntie.

355
00:25:13,929 --> 00:25:15,347
-Yes?
-Here.

356
00:25:16,473 --> 00:25:18,183
You're the best, Sang-hyeon.

357
00:25:56,554 --> 00:25:57,806
Excuse me for a second.

358
00:25:58,932 --> 00:26:00,350
I'm sorry.

359
00:26:01,643 --> 00:26:02,519
Give it.

360
00:26:07,732 --> 00:26:10,944
A peach has a short stem,

361
00:26:11,027 --> 00:26:13,905
so you have to wrap it
around the branch too.

362
00:26:14,489 --> 00:26:16,616
Like this. See?

363
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:20,036
-Do you think you can do it?
-Yes, I'll give it a try.

364
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:25,875
Wrap it around the branch, like this?

365
00:26:25,959 --> 00:26:26,876
Yes, like that.

366
00:26:27,377 --> 00:26:28,295
Good job.

367
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:34,009
Listen.

368
00:26:34,092 --> 00:26:38,680
Aunt Se-ryeon can't hear about
what happened earlier in Majeong.

369
00:26:38,763 --> 00:26:40,682
If they fight, it's going to be a pain.

370
00:26:43,977 --> 00:26:46,271
I have no time or energy to gossip.

371
00:26:49,232 --> 00:26:52,110
Right, I forgot you didn't care
about this village.

372
00:26:53,403 --> 00:26:56,865
I'm sorry you ended up working
when you came to get some coffee.

373
00:26:56,948 --> 00:26:59,367
This must be crossing your boundaries.

374
00:27:04,789 --> 00:27:07,542
I reacted too emotionally yesterday.

375
00:27:10,211 --> 00:27:13,965
I'm quickly coming to realize
there's no such thing as boundaries here,

376
00:27:14,049 --> 00:27:17,886
so please forget what I said
and stop teasing me.

377
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:24,267
Jeez.

378
00:27:26,853 --> 00:27:30,648
Sometimes you're annoying,
but sometimes I feel bad for you.

379
00:27:30,732 --> 00:27:33,735
You can rely on me a little
while you're staying here.

380
00:27:33,818 --> 00:27:35,278
I'm a police officer here.

381
00:27:36,321 --> 00:27:39,324
And who do you have to rely on?

382
00:27:39,407 --> 00:27:40,325
Pardon?

383
00:27:44,662 --> 00:27:46,623
-Just like this, right?
-Yes.

384
00:27:47,874 --> 00:27:50,126
-Well, I'll be…
-The branch… Sure.

385
00:28:10,313 --> 00:28:12,565
You can't help but look at them, can you?

386
00:28:13,149 --> 00:28:15,944
You feel that tingling sensation
in your hearts, don't you?

387
00:28:16,027 --> 00:28:18,154
Jeez, give it a rest.

388
00:28:18,238 --> 00:28:19,781
Her mate is standing right there.

389
00:28:19,864 --> 00:28:21,950
That city slicker has no chance.

390
00:28:22,033 --> 00:28:23,243
What?

391
00:28:26,121 --> 00:28:27,372
You better watch out.

392
00:28:27,455 --> 00:28:28,706
You might lose her.

393
00:28:29,666 --> 00:28:31,709
Come on, I told you it's not like that.

394
00:28:31,793 --> 00:28:36,172
I wish she would just date someone.
I don't even care who.

395
00:28:36,256 --> 00:28:41,136
Just look at her.
My goodness, she's pretty.

396
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:43,972
When her grandmother was alive,

397
00:28:44,055 --> 00:28:49,519
she wouldn't stop talking
about finding a man for Ja-young.

398
00:28:49,602 --> 00:28:52,647
I bet she's still too worried about her
to rest in peace.

399
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:58,445
And who would be a better fit for her
than our own Lee Sang-hyeon?

400
00:28:58,528 --> 00:29:01,865
What if she ends up with the vet
and wants to move to Seoul?

401
00:29:01,948 --> 00:29:04,576
The median age of the village
would shoot up.

402
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:08,580
Look at her.
Gyeong-ok feels the same as I do.

403
00:29:09,622 --> 00:29:12,125
Something's shooting out of her eyes.

404
00:29:13,001 --> 00:29:15,378
Come on, she's not even interested.

405
00:29:15,462 --> 00:29:17,922
She's too busy
taking care of the entire village.

406
00:29:19,841 --> 00:29:24,220
Hey, she just didn't have anybody
to be interested in.

407
00:29:24,721 --> 00:29:26,556
If the right person appears,

408
00:29:26,639 --> 00:29:31,019
she'll change her mind in a heartbeat.

409
00:29:31,102 --> 00:29:33,521
Come on. Did you not hear yesterday?

410
00:29:33,605 --> 00:29:36,524
"Stop! I have a girlfriend!"

411
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:38,902
I guess it would be weird
if he didn't have one.

412
00:29:38,985 --> 00:29:40,361
He has a girlfriend?

413
00:29:40,445 --> 00:29:42,572
He's not married or anything.

414
00:29:42,655 --> 00:29:45,325
It's not even a big deal
to find someone new at that age.

415
00:29:47,869 --> 00:29:51,456
If he doesn't feel anything
looking at a girl like Ja-young,

416
00:29:51,539 --> 00:29:54,626
he's not really a man, is he?

417
00:29:57,545 --> 00:29:58,922
-A truck?
-Yes.

418
00:30:00,131 --> 00:30:02,091
I was going to ask through Officer Ahn,

419
00:30:02,175 --> 00:30:04,344
but then I thought that wouldn't be right,

420
00:30:04,427 --> 00:30:05,929
so I came to ask you in person.

421
00:30:06,471 --> 00:30:09,682
So you came for the truck
and ended up helping out.

422
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:12,852
But why did you think
it wouldn't be right?

423
00:30:14,145 --> 00:30:15,188
Well…

424
00:30:17,524 --> 00:30:19,567
It could cause a misunderstanding.

425
00:30:20,235 --> 00:30:23,404
It looks like rumors spread
very quickly in this village.

426
00:30:24,155 --> 00:30:25,156
Misunderstanding?

427
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:29,994
My goodness, Doctor Han!

428
00:30:30,537 --> 00:30:33,039
They're not like that.

429
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:38,461
The whole village has been
egging them on for over a decade.

430
00:30:38,545 --> 00:30:42,590
But there's no hope for those two.
It's been that way for a while.

431
00:30:42,674 --> 00:30:45,218
Maybe when they turn 60,
they might shack up together

432
00:30:45,301 --> 00:30:47,136
because they're tired of
visiting each other.

433
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:49,681
You know what I mean?

434
00:30:50,807 --> 00:30:52,141
What do you mean, no hope?

435
00:30:52,725 --> 00:30:54,561
Hey, should we make it 70?

436
00:30:54,644 --> 00:30:57,939
For heaven's sake. Make it 80. No, 90!

437
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:06,197
Hey, you two sort that out on your own.
Eighty, ninety, what's the difference?

438
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:09,534
-We're going to go prepare some snacks.
-Right.

439
00:31:09,617 --> 00:31:11,160
-That's right.
-Okay, let's go.

440
00:31:11,244 --> 00:31:13,037
Just work it out between you two.

441
00:31:13,121 --> 00:31:15,957
-Right. Thank you for the help.
-Sure.

442
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:18,751
We're going to take our time
preparing the snacks.

443
00:31:18,835 --> 00:31:21,713
So if you get hungry, you can come.

444
00:31:21,796 --> 00:31:24,883
And you can come in pairs.
That's fine too.

445
00:31:24,966 --> 00:31:26,301
Okay. See you in a bit.

446
00:31:26,384 --> 00:31:27,260
-Sure.
-Sure.

447
00:31:28,678 --> 00:31:31,764
I guess I was mistaken.

448
00:31:32,348 --> 00:31:34,058
You two looked close. I'm sorry.

449
00:31:34,142 --> 00:31:35,226
It's okay.

450
00:31:36,686 --> 00:31:39,522
-We are that close.
-Hey.

451
00:31:43,109 --> 00:31:43,943
Right.

452
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:49,032
Wait, this is good.
You said you wanted to get rid of a truck.

453
00:31:49,657 --> 00:31:51,409
-I did?
-Yes, you did.

454
00:31:51,492 --> 00:31:53,161
-I don't remember.
-What are you talking about?

455
00:32:16,017 --> 00:32:17,393
Were you in Majeong earlier?

456
00:32:18,645 --> 00:32:20,480
-Did you see me there?
-Yes.

457
00:32:21,439 --> 00:32:24,025
I went to check in on Gi-taek.

458
00:32:25,193 --> 00:32:26,736
Why didn't you give me a ride?

459
00:32:27,654 --> 00:32:29,113
I had work to do.

460
00:32:30,615 --> 00:32:32,033
Did you go there with that guy?

461
00:32:33,076 --> 00:32:36,287
Why would I go with him?
We just ran into each other.

462
00:32:36,829 --> 00:32:39,332
Did something happen between you two?

463
00:32:41,668 --> 00:32:42,961
Nothing happened.

464
00:32:51,928 --> 00:32:53,471
Are you done looking?

465
00:32:53,554 --> 00:32:54,764
Yes, it's nice.

466
00:32:55,306 --> 00:32:57,767
I heard my grandfather has been
borrowing that one,

467
00:32:57,850 --> 00:33:00,353
so he'll have no problem using it
after I'm gone.

468
00:33:00,436 --> 00:33:02,146
And I'll pay you properly.

469
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:05,525
Since he's quite old,
I'd really like to get him a truck.

470
00:33:08,027 --> 00:33:09,988
Are you really buying it for the director?

471
00:33:10,613 --> 00:33:11,447
Pardon?

472
00:33:11,531 --> 00:33:12,782
Ten million.

473
00:33:13,491 --> 00:33:14,867
What? How much?

474
00:33:14,951 --> 00:33:16,619
I'm a businessman.

475
00:33:16,703 --> 00:33:18,454
I'm not the desperate one here.

476
00:33:19,205 --> 00:33:23,126
I don't need a lot of money right now,
so I have no reason to sell it for cheap.

477
00:33:23,209 --> 00:33:26,546
If he's not in a hurry,
he's welcome to buy one elsewhere.

478
00:33:27,255 --> 00:33:28,464
Isn't that right?

479
00:33:30,008 --> 00:33:33,469
Hey, do you know how old that thing is
in human years?

480
00:33:33,553 --> 00:33:35,763
Just look at its mileage.

481
00:33:35,847 --> 00:33:37,765
You can't just slash the price like that.

482
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:39,976
I have a lot of fond memories with it.

483
00:33:40,059 --> 00:33:41,894
What's with the attachment?

484
00:33:41,978 --> 00:33:45,064
I'm sure it has more memories
with your dad than with you.

485
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:48,067
Fine.

486
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:49,902
Eight million.

487
00:33:56,409 --> 00:33:57,869
What's wrong with you?

488
00:33:57,952 --> 00:34:00,455
He's finally opening up
and asking for a favor,

489
00:34:00,538 --> 00:34:03,374
and the Young Men's Association
president acts like this?

490
00:34:03,458 --> 00:34:04,625
He helped out today.

491
00:34:04,709 --> 00:34:07,420
He barely covered three trees.
He didn't help much.

492
00:34:08,337 --> 00:34:10,548
What about you?
Why are you helping him this much

493
00:34:10,631 --> 00:34:12,967
when he doesn't even want to talk
to people like us?

494
00:34:13,676 --> 00:34:16,095
I always get involved
in any village affair.

495
00:34:17,263 --> 00:34:18,806
He's a not village resident.

496
00:34:21,517 --> 00:34:24,353
Just sell it for five million.
That's still a lot.

497
00:34:24,437 --> 00:34:25,605
I don't want to.

498
00:34:25,688 --> 00:34:26,606
You punk…

499
00:34:27,231 --> 00:34:28,191
Hey.

500
00:34:29,901 --> 00:34:30,902
That's enough.

501
00:34:31,611 --> 00:34:33,613
Looks like you don't
really want to sell it,

502
00:34:33,696 --> 00:34:35,156
and I must have imposed on you.

503
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:37,617
I'll look elsewhere. Have a good day.

504
00:34:38,326 --> 00:34:39,368
Wait.

505
00:34:39,952 --> 00:34:43,498
There's a fairly big used-car lot
two villages over.

506
00:34:43,581 --> 00:34:45,208
Do you want to check it out?

507
00:34:45,291 --> 00:34:47,919
I'm on good terms with the owner.

508
00:34:48,002 --> 00:34:50,880
If I go with you,
he might give you a good deal.

509
00:34:52,298 --> 00:34:54,175
Well, that would be great.

510
00:34:54,258 --> 00:34:58,179
Also, I hear they offer a lot of discounts
to young married couples

511
00:34:58,262 --> 00:35:00,556
who are settling in the countryside.

512
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,600
-Married couples?
-Isn't that right?

513
00:35:06,104 --> 00:35:09,148
We can just go together
and make it appear like we are.

514
00:35:09,232 --> 00:35:10,858
You helped out here today,

515
00:35:10,942 --> 00:35:12,401
-so it's the least--
-Five.

516
00:35:13,611 --> 00:35:17,156
If you needed it that urgently,
you should have told me.

517
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:20,451
Why bother with the pretend marriage
out in this hot weather?

518
00:35:20,535 --> 00:35:23,412
I'll suffer a loss,
but I'll sell it to you.

519
00:35:24,247 --> 00:35:27,458
But if they offer such good deals,
I should go check it out.

520
00:35:29,252 --> 00:35:31,129
I appreciate you coming with me.

521
00:35:31,212 --> 00:35:34,090
The cargo rack is big,
so you won't feel uncomfortable.

522
00:35:34,173 --> 00:35:36,134
I'll make sure to have it unloaded.

523
00:35:36,217 --> 00:35:38,219
I'll even put a cushion on it.

524
00:35:38,302 --> 00:35:40,179
-You don't have to--
-Four million.

525
00:35:42,181 --> 00:35:44,267
The sooner you go
on house calls comfortably,

526
00:35:44,350 --> 00:35:46,644
the better for our village animals.

527
00:35:47,854 --> 00:35:48,980
Don't you think so?

528
00:35:52,608 --> 00:35:54,777
-Send me your bank account number.
-Okay.

529
00:36:09,041 --> 00:36:09,876
Take a seat here.

530
00:36:13,504 --> 00:36:16,507
Are you worried that I'm going
to become close with that guy?

531
00:36:16,591 --> 00:36:17,633
What are you saying?

532
00:36:17,717 --> 00:36:18,843
What are you, a child?

533
00:36:19,552 --> 00:36:24,390
You always used to pout like a duck
whenever we weren't in the same class.

534
00:36:25,141 --> 00:36:27,101
How have you not changed a bit,
you big baby?

535
00:36:27,935 --> 00:36:29,020
Quack, quack.

536
00:36:34,108 --> 00:36:35,985
Do you remember?

537
00:36:36,068 --> 00:36:39,906
My secret friend from summer break
when we were 12.

538
00:36:42,658 --> 00:36:44,535
"You don't have one? I do."

539
00:36:45,745 --> 00:36:49,040
You never stopped talking about it.
Secret friend, my foot.

540
00:36:50,333 --> 00:36:52,835
A secret gains its value
when it's shared, okay?

541
00:36:54,003 --> 00:36:55,671
So why are you suddenly bringing it up?

542
00:36:58,466 --> 00:36:59,342
It turns out,

543
00:37:00,927 --> 00:37:02,428
he's that secret friend.

544
00:37:04,222 --> 00:37:05,264
Who?

545
00:37:07,516 --> 00:37:08,768
You mean that vet?

546
00:37:08,851 --> 00:37:11,145
Is that why you were going on
about memories last night?

547
00:37:12,855 --> 00:37:16,609
It was such a long time ago,
and as you can see,

548
00:37:16,692 --> 00:37:18,277
he doesn't even recognize me.

549
00:37:19,528 --> 00:37:21,197
At first, I was a little irritated

550
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,366
because I was the only one who remembered.

551
00:37:23,449 --> 00:37:24,867
But what can I do?

552
00:37:24,951 --> 00:37:29,247
To him, it was only that much of a memory.

553
00:37:30,289 --> 00:37:34,293
I don't want to act like I remember
when he doesn't.

554
00:37:34,377 --> 00:37:37,046
And I won't be seeing him
after two months.

555
00:37:37,838 --> 00:37:41,175
I just want him to feel comfortable
while he's here.

556
00:37:41,884 --> 00:37:42,718
That's all.

557
00:37:47,139 --> 00:37:50,142
So stop pouting over nothing.

558
00:37:50,226 --> 00:37:52,270
And don't act all crazy like earlier.

559
00:37:52,353 --> 00:37:53,562
Okay?

560
00:37:53,646 --> 00:37:54,605
Fine.

561
00:37:56,774 --> 00:37:58,859
Jeez, I'll get going then.

562
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:32,143
And who do you have to rely on?

563
00:39:05,843 --> 00:39:07,678
-Will he come back?
-Nurungji!

564
00:39:07,762 --> 00:39:09,430
What if he doesn't?

565
00:39:09,513 --> 00:39:10,389
No!

566
00:39:10,473 --> 00:39:12,808
The calf is stuck on the pelvic bone.
I have to pull it out quickly.

567
00:39:13,684 --> 00:39:15,227
Don't you miss your girlfriend?

568
00:39:16,103 --> 00:39:17,897
I think we would get along.

569
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:19,857
You must be a lightweight with alcohol.

570
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:22,360
You must have been really worried
about something.

571
00:39:22,443 --> 00:39:24,236
When I see you, I want to hold you.

572
00:39:24,862 --> 00:39:26,155
I want to hug you.

573
00:39:26,238 --> 00:39:29,283
I'm the same as any other dude out there.

574
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:33,287
