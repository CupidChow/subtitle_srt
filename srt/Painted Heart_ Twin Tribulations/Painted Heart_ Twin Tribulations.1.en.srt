1
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:32,690
It has been six years since the Apocalypse.

2
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:36,410
As the god of war, Xuantian, was not on duty,

3
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:39,530
and the broken Demon Pavilion of Heaven Realm,

4
00:00:40,270 --> 00:00:41,120
for that time,

5
00:00:41,650 --> 00:00:44,420
li Yang from the capital city descended to the Milky Way.

6
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:46,790
The Three Realms were in turmoil.

7
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:51,790
Black Peng, the Demon King,

8
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:53,890
took the opportunity to take away the demon spirit

9
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:55,540
and fled to the mortal world.

10
00:00:56,610 --> 00:00:58,270
The God of War came from Heaven

11
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:01,690
I wanted to capture him and I looked far away.

12
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:11,170
Don't.

13
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:25,240
I'll listen to Magic Lotus and stop using Magical Lotus.

14
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:28,780
I use Forbidden Bone and Heavenly Tortoise

15
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:30,130
and help me practice.

16
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,850
This card is the Holy Flower transformed by the spiritual energy of heaven and earth.

17
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,230
If it is in your hands,

18
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:36,670
would cause trouble to the world.

19
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:47,320
Stop her.

20
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:51,520
You need to be able to do that.

21
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:04,300
White.

22
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:22,730
# Meet my heart #

23
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:26,810
I won't betray you.

24
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:43,320
The Xuantian God of War should have been guarding with all his heart,

25
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:46,440
but you and the Divine Flower touch human hearts

26
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:48,120
and made a big mistake.

27
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:50,870
That he would first punish you to the mortal world.

28
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:52,840
And reincarnate as a human.

29
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:54,640
And wait for a day

30
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:56,500
fortunately, monsters in the mortal world

31
00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:58,270
and return to Heaven Realm.

32
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:17,350
Shenhua.

33
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:20,410
You are destined to meet me.

34
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:24,460
Now I lead you to Golden Light Cave

35
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:26,680
and help you rebuild your body

36
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,930
to give you a helping hand.

37
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:46,560
Second,

38
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:48,940
I need you to concentrate.

39
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:50,550
Collect the aura of heaven and earth.

40
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:52,770
Feel the essence of the sun and the moon,

41
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,720
soak up the brilliance of all things.

42
00:03:55,490 --> 00:03:58,350
And practice with the Heart Method I taught him.

43
00:03:58,550 --> 00:04:00,445
After they succeed in cultivation,

44
00:04:00,445 --> 00:04:02,820
they can be mobilized to practice.

45
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,670
I will follow your instructions.

46
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:09,570
Watch your steps.

47
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:12,540
Sister.

48
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:13,560
Come on!

49
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,915
Sister, look, I made this for you.

50
00:04:19,915 --> 00:04:20,545
Nice?

51
00:04:20,545 --> 00:04:21,120
It's nice.

52
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:23,460
Each of us has one.

53
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:35,290
Second,

54
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:36,640
the flowers of the back hill have bloomed.

55
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:37,990
I'll take you there.

56
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:47,380
Jill.

57
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:48,610
Stop playing.

58
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:51,490
Your cultivation will be affected.

59
00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:52,990
Yi Yao.

60
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:53,770
Sorry...

61
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:54,850
For disturbing the both of you.

62
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:56,710
I'm off.

63
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,120
20 years later,

64
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,720
the demons and the human beings are running wild.

65
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:11,050
Monsters collude with barbarians

66
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,420
which causes the smoke everywhere.

67
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:19,480
The young general king was born to fight all over the country with great weapons.

68
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:21,400
Eliminating demons.

69
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:25,900
We've saved countless immigrants.

70
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:33,670
I didn't expect to cast magic.

71
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:43,330
Beware of monsters lying in wait.

72
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:53,800
Everyone!

73
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:54,730
Withdraw!

74
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:56,320
General gives the order.

75
00:05:58,290 --> 00:05:58,595
Withdraw!

76
00:05:58,595 --> 00:05:59,620
What should we do, General?

77
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:11,165
General.

78
00:06:11,165 --> 00:06:12,400
That's bad!

79
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:14,080
How could you be so mean to me?

80
00:06:23,730 --> 00:06:25,450
I've long heard about your great name.

81
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:27,310
Seeing is believing.

82
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,710
But why did you draw your sword when you first met?

83
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:33,990
And also

84
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:36,630
you have two ability of shameless witch

85
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:38,580
yet she has to be seduced by beauty.

86
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:40,380
This is interesting.

87
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:44,500
How can this knife hurt me?

88
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:46,630
It's not an ordinary body.

89
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:49,640
I wanted to give you pleasure.

90
00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:51,680
What a pity!

91
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,150
Are you alright?

92
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:56,930
She's fine.

93
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:18,680
Don't be distracted.

94
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:19,910
He's very cunning.

95
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:21,620
We have to force him out first.

96
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:51,850
General, you're skilled.

97
00:07:52,350 --> 00:07:53,140
I have you as well.

98
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:58,230
Don't you even know your name?

99
00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:00,960
My name is Little Yao.

100
00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:04,810
Drink more.

101
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:07,450
Drink more.

102
00:08:07,770 --> 00:08:10,750
Thanks to your help today,

103
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:13,360
let's thank Miss Yao more.

104
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,480
Eat more later.

105
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:17,510
I'm full.

106
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:18,220
Thank you, Uncle Yang.

107
00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:20,260
- What are you doing? - Done.

108
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:21,670
Come on.

109
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:23,470
Let's drink together.

110
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:24,700
Let's drink together.

111
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:30,580
Thank you, Little Yao, for saving us.

112
00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:31,720
Toast to you, my friend.

113
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:33,340
I've never drunk any wine.

114
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:39,100
You're welcome.

115
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:41,560
Defeating monsters and demons is part of my duty.

116
00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:45,188
You must not taste that bad.

117
00:08:45,188 --> 00:08:45,670
Drink it.

118
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:47,105
Hurry up!

119
00:08:47,105 --> 00:08:47,500
Hurry up!

120
00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:49,090
Miss Bird, you can drink a lot.

121
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:49,930
General.

122
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,895
In the war these days,

123
00:08:52,895 --> 00:08:53,420
these days.

124
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:54,995
We can drink more today.

125
00:08:54,995 --> 00:08:55,990
Thank you for your hard work.

126
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:56,500
Come on.

127
00:08:56,970 --> 00:08:58,270
Why is it strange?

128
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:01,780
OK.

129
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:02,920
Welcome everyone.

130
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:05,535
Everyone is happy tonight.

131
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:06,045
Alright.

132
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:07,020
Take it off.

133
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:07,755
Drink more.

134
00:09:07,755 --> 00:09:08,240
Okay, come on.

135
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:09,145
I'll get the drinks.

136
00:09:09,145 --> 00:09:10,598
Buy me the wine, too.

137
00:09:10,598 --> 00:09:11,130
Come on.

138
00:09:11,130 --> 00:09:11,565
Drink together.

139
00:09:11,565 --> 00:09:13,100
-Let's drink together. -Come.

140
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:20,960
You two were shaped by holy flowers.

141
00:09:21,130 --> 00:09:22,520
With pure souls,

142
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:25,610
you must be careful not to touch anything in the mortal world.

143
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:28,760
In case of leakage of spiritual power.

144
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:34,970
No way.

145
00:09:35,290 --> 00:09:36,320
We can't stay here for long.

146
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:42,200
How is Qi Er now?

147
00:09:42,970 --> 00:09:43,365
Master.

148
00:09:43,365 --> 00:09:45,320
Suppress the evil energy in his body?

149
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:50,090
It's cold outside.

150
00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:52,100
You can go in if you have nothing to do.

151
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:54,880
General.

152
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,530
Master entrusted me

153
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:57,880
feel at home wherever one goes

154
00:09:58,290 --> 00:09:59,200
eliminate traitors and help the weak.

155
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,930
Now the demon has been recovered.

156
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:04,540
It's time for me to leave.

157
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:09,610
We are fated to meet each other.

158
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,650
If you don't mind this amulet,

159
00:10:12,650 --> 00:10:13,390
just take it.

160
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:15,830
This talisman can protect you

161
00:10:15,830 --> 00:10:16,990
when they encounter a monster.

162
00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:25,820
I'm a warrior.

163
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:27,350
Have only bare necessities at home

164
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:31,000
give her this blade.

165
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:35,400
Dear Lord,

166
00:10:36,830 --> 00:10:38,940
I have had it since I was born.

167
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:43,080
I'm not clear about the writing.

168
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:45,690
Then I can't take it.

169
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:48,630
You used this knife to eliminate demons.

170
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:50,790
You risked your life to save me.

171
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,230
Don't shirk your responsibility.

172
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,640
I'll keep it for you temporarily.

173
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,090
Hope we can see each other again.

174
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:19,990
Can I stay?

175
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:26,880
No!

176
00:12:02,730 --> 00:12:03,130
Stay here.

177
00:12:07,410 --> 00:12:09,700
I might get divorced today.

178
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:19,480
You won't come?

179
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:23,350
Little

180
00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:29,830
little Yao.

181
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:31,870
If there were no wars in this world,

182
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:34,990
would we be able to

183
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:38,980
depends on you, the Grand General.

184
00:12:51,710 --> 00:12:52,530
He surrendered.

185
00:12:53,210 --> 00:12:54,060
We surrendered.

186
00:12:54,230 --> 00:12:55,050
We can...

187
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:57,190
We can finally go home.

188
00:12:57,190 --> 00:12:57,870
You're injured!

189
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:01,560
Sister,

190
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:05,760
I know what you did that day

191
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:07,740
It was for him?

192
00:13:15,770 --> 00:13:16,440
But I haven't seen him!

193
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:23,580
Qi!

194
00:13:23,930 --> 00:13:24,450
Qi'er!

195
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:25,530
What's wrong?

196
00:13:26,210 --> 00:13:26,605
Qi'er!

197
00:13:26,605 --> 00:13:27,300
Stop it!

198
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:28,800
You will deviate from the right track.

199
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:29,610
Qi'er!

200
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:31,165
I'll call Master.

201
00:13:31,165 --> 00:13:32,160
I cultivated on that day,

202
00:13:32,570 --> 00:13:34,080
I accidentally went astray.

203
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:37,530
But when I woke up, I was surrounded by troops.

204
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:40,200
I'm the General of the Western Expedition, Wang Tianzheng's Division Driver.

205
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:41,760
Who are you?

206
00:13:42,290 --> 00:13:42,960
General Zhang.

207
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:47,370
Is fleeing.

208
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:50,220
The evil girl wants to fight with us.

209
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:51,510
Sister,

210
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:52,770
where are you?

211
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:56,460
The cave collapsed

212
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:58,170
kunlun was affected by this.

213
00:13:58,730 --> 00:14:02,730
In the end, his body only reached the 15th of July

214
00:14:03,170 --> 00:14:04,410
that's true!

215
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:07,500
It's just that

216
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:12,660
the mind of Zhixiu

217
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,560
must be maintained by the human body.

218
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:20,560
Your Ladyship, please don't kill me.

219
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:22,150
Your Ladyship.

220
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:25,600
Your Ladyship, don't kill me.

221
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:30,170
Your Ladyship, don't kill me.

222
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:31,150
Your Ladyship, please don't kill me.

223
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,890
I'm willing to serve you all my life.

224
00:14:33,090 --> 00:14:34,090
To kill me.

225
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:40,750
Rou,

226
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:42,190
don't be scared.

227
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:45,490
I just want to borrow your vase.

228
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:52,540
Thanks to you,

229
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:55,660
I became the demon in the mortal world.

230
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:03,350
Kunlun,

231
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,150
the sincerity you want.

232
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:06,830
I will find...

233
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:11,310
Very happy.

234
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:15,078
The wind is so strong.

235
00:15:15,078 --> 00:15:16,880
The water will definitely rise.

236
00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:18,680
It's too dangerous to take a boat like this.

237
00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:20,500
Broadsword.

238
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:26,950
Please find a place nearby where you can expose your feet.

239
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:29,320
Yes. The war has ended.

240
00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:31,300
The view is more beautiful than usual.

241
00:15:40,590 --> 00:15:41,470
Look at them.

242
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:43,390
A good deed is around the corner.

243
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:46,300
General is usually so dull.

244
00:15:46,530 --> 00:15:47,560
But today,

245
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:48,910
If it's done,

246
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:03,880
what are they?

247
00:16:06,930 --> 00:16:08,140
Are you ready?

248
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:36,810
Help

249
00:16:37,190 --> 00:16:37,800
help

250
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:39,720
ah

251
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:54,930
are you all right?

252
00:16:58,030 --> 00:16:58,850
These traitors!

253
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:00,230
I spared your lives.

254
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:01,700
I'm afraid he's dying.

255
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:08,800
Thank you for saving my life.

256
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:11,050
If you do anything to repay your kindness,

257
00:17:11,370 --> 00:17:12,790
no need for that.

258
00:17:13,170 --> 00:17:14,405
Miss, what's her name?

259
00:17:14,405 --> 00:17:15,280
Where does she live?

260
00:17:15,390 --> 00:17:17,290
Why are you here alone?

261
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:19,750
My name is Xiaorou.

262
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:21,040
And I live in the Wen's Mansion on the other side.

263
00:17:21,210 --> 00:17:22,300
She is the legitimate daughter of my family.

264
00:17:22,830 --> 00:17:24,160
I love making incense.

265
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:25,930
When I came to pick flowers today,

266
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:27,950
I ran into these bandits.

267
00:17:28,210 --> 00:17:29,390
And brought me here.

268
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:32,650
Without your help,

269
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:36,510
I don't know how I would meet you in the future.

270
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:37,290
Don't worry.

271
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:38,550
We are here.

272
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:39,930
You must be safe.

273
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:41,490
But it's windy now.

274
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:43,245
I can't make it

275
00:17:43,245 --> 00:17:44,180
go home by boat.

276
00:17:45,410 --> 00:17:46,890
You can come with us

277
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:48,360
please come with us.

278
00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:51,790
General.

279
00:17:52,650 --> 00:17:54,100
There's a place to stay ahead.

280
00:17:54,570 --> 00:17:55,480
- Set off. - Yes, sir.

281
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:58,000
Right?

282
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:09,490
I used to stop here for outing materials.

283
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:12,850
General.

284
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:14,075
There's no one in the village.

285
00:18:14,075 --> 00:18:14,720
It's so strange.

286
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:15,580
Should we leave?

287
00:18:16,730 --> 00:18:18,540
Take a few people and set scouts around.

288
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:19,195
It's stopped.

289
00:18:19,195 --> 00:18:19,830
Let's leave right away.

290
00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:26,820
The rest of you follow me to the port to prepare in advance.

291
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:30,375
Come on.

292
00:18:30,375 --> 00:18:31,190
Take it there.

293
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:35,150
Clean up that place!

294
00:18:39,530 --> 00:18:40,260
They're coming.

295
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:41,820
General,

296
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:44,580
thank you for saving my life, General.

297
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:45,300
Bring it here.

298
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:46,825
I have nothing to repay you.

299
00:18:46,825 --> 00:18:47,640
And make delicious food for you.

300
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:48,510
Lift a finger

301
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:49,795
don't worry.

302
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:50,035
Sister.

303
00:18:50,035 --> 00:18:50,490
Eat it.

304
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:51,660
The token...

305
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:55,980
Xiaorou has finished packing. Go there.

306
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:58,080
The general has been fighting wars since childhood.

307
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,370
You don't stick to trifles.

308
00:18:59,810 --> 00:19:01,170
I hope you won't mind it.

309
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:03,120
You know General so well.

310
00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:06,070
Don't tell me you like him?

311
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:09,340
I don't!

312
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:12,820
Why are you blushing then?

313
00:19:13,470 --> 00:19:14,350
Cut the crap.

314
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:15,790
I'm off.

315
00:19:18,030 --> 00:19:18,790
Be careful.

316
00:19:27,370 --> 00:19:28,490
Help yourselves.

317
00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:30,920
You really

318
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:32,210
really excellent.

319
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:33,350
Brothers.

320
00:19:33,730 --> 00:19:34,970
My son is blessed.

321
00:19:35,530 --> 00:19:36,480
Eat.

322
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,850
Then we can work.

323
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,350
Luckily, you didn't help.

324
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:44,030
Or we would be in trouble.

325
00:19:44,290 --> 00:19:46,290
You can't shut your mouth with all these delicacies.

326
00:19:46,290 --> 00:19:47,175
Eat quickly.

327
00:19:47,175 --> 00:19:49,040
Or there won't be any left.

328
00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:51,350
You must be tired after travelling today.

329
00:19:51,670 --> 00:19:52,580
Eat more.

330
00:19:57,610 --> 00:19:58,670
Again?

331
00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:06,720
Is it good?

332
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:09,270
Slow down.

333
00:20:09,770 --> 00:20:10,560
This is delicious.

334
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:12,310
Try it.

335
00:20:12,310 --> 00:20:13,080
This is not bad.

336
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:18,140
Because I want to

337
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:22,040
give me more.

338
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:26,300
Son and girl,

339
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:42,640
what are you thinking?

340
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:44,570
Left hand first

341
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:46,150
It's OK.

342
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:47,920
This is strange.

343
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:48,665
Miss Ru

344
00:20:48,665 --> 00:20:50,230
miss Ru is such a great cook.

345
00:20:50,430 --> 00:20:51,560
You cook at home.

346
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:52,750
Your cooking skills are amazing.

347
00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:53,770
Not really.

348
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:55,390
No one is there to support me.

349
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:56,860
It's getting cold.

350
00:20:57,660 --> 00:20:58,810
Why don't we go back first?

351
00:20:59,130 --> 00:21:00,965
We haven't been to such delicious food in a long time.

352
00:21:00,965 --> 00:21:01,385
Right.

353
00:21:01,385 --> 00:21:01,960
Mother.

354
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:03,670
That you can accept human food,

355
00:21:03,990 --> 00:21:05,260
what are we doing here?

356
00:21:05,370 --> 00:21:06,275
We have so much work.

357
00:21:06,275 --> 00:21:06,940
Go right now!

358
00:21:07,650 --> 00:21:08,170
Hurry.

359
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,340
Hurry and take it.

360
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:11,110
Back to work.

361
00:21:13,290 --> 00:21:14,050
Miss Xiangru,

362
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:15,580
you don't look well.

363
00:21:16,110 --> 00:21:17,380
Let me send you back to rest.

364
00:21:18,470 --> 00:21:19,410
Move it.

365
00:21:19,670 --> 00:21:20,460
I'm alright.

366
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:21,810
I won't bother you.

367
00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:22,860
I'll leave now.

368
00:21:22,910 --> 00:21:23,425
I'll send you back.

369
00:21:23,425 --> 00:21:23,970
I'll send you there.

370
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:32,670
You who could only draw from your aura,

371
00:21:33,410 --> 00:21:37,320
for that man, I can eat and drink all my life.

372
00:21:40,910 --> 00:21:41,550
Sister,

373
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:43,380
you've really changed.

374
00:21:47,410 --> 00:21:48,410
Three days later,

375
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,240
then it's the 15th of July.

376
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,290
Beg for a sweetheart.

377
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:59,400
I can always find someone I love.

378
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:01,550
It's fair.

379
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:02,930
Right?

380
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:10,160
It seems someone took the bait.

381
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:33,480
Leave now!

382
00:22:33,590 --> 00:22:34,560
The mountain is collapsing.

383
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:35,190
Hurry.

384
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:38,460
Be careful

385
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:54,810
It's special just now.

386
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:56,515
Right. Offend that demon?

387
00:22:56,515 --> 00:22:57,310
Was caught by me.

388
00:22:57,310 --> 00:22:58,170
For not reading it.

389
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:00,500
You're a demon hunter.

390
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:01,665
You can say that.

391
00:23:01,665 --> 00:23:04,550
Could you stay and help us eliminate demons?

392
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:05,630
Of course.

393
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:07,940
But I have something urgent to do now.

394
00:23:08,050 --> 00:23:09,050
I hope you can come next time.

395
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:09,830
I'll leave now.

396
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:21,090
General, good at fighting.

397
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:22,200
Luckily, I have you.

398
00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:25,250
Can you stay?

399
00:23:40,010 --> 00:23:40,590
Duck.

400
00:23:43,410 --> 00:23:45,640
It's good to have you by my side.

401
00:23:47,490 --> 00:23:48,370
What?

402
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:50,200
If Miss Xiaorou hadn't

403
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:53,260
I don't know my cooking is so awful

404
00:23:53,970 --> 00:23:55,360
and made you suffer for so long.

405
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:00,050
But I feel that

406
00:24:00,970 --> 00:24:02,330
whatever you do is fine.

407
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:11,300
What if I lied to you?

408
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:13,370
Would you still think I'm good?

409
00:24:15,130 --> 00:24:16,160
If you lied to me,

410
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:18,110
you must have your own reasons.

411
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,570
You must have suffered more than me.

412
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:24,120
I promise you that

413
00:24:24,650 --> 00:24:27,330
no matter what you do, I won't blame you.

414
00:24:29,570 --> 00:24:30,120
Really?

415
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:39,750
I want to tell you that

416
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:42,180
actually...

417
00:24:45,170 --> 00:24:45,570
I...

418
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:49,740
In fact, what I want to say is the same as you.

419
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:51,160
Little Yao.

420
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:53,290
Before I met you,

421
00:24:53,670 --> 00:24:55,450
I never expected to have a family.

422
00:24:57,330 --> 00:24:58,270
When I was young,

423
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:00,700
when barbarians collude with monsters,

424
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:01,690
and bring trouble to the world.

425
00:25:03,530 --> 00:25:04,410
My parents were

426
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:06,630
were also killed by monsters.

427
00:25:08,350 --> 00:25:09,170
After that,

428
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:11,260
I devoted myself to fighting in the battlefield

429
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:12,670
demons and spirits.

430
00:25:13,990 --> 00:25:15,830
Because I don't want my tragedy to repeat.

431
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:17,570
Monsters deserve to die!

432
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:19,820
Those who are not our clan

433
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:21,020
whose intention is punishable by death?

434
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:26,340
Little Yao.

435
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,200
Ever since I met you,

436
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:30,360
and eliminate demons together.

437
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:33,810
We are of the same mind.

438
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:35,550
We can start one o'clock now.

439
00:25:36,690 --> 00:25:37,660
I'm going back.

440
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:53,570
Are you sure you saw it right?

441
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:55,400
Be careful.

442
00:25:56,410 --> 00:25:56,775
This way.

443
00:25:56,775 --> 00:25:57,170
This way.

444
00:25:57,550 --> 00:25:59,870
I saw a few bun soldiers running here with my own eyes.

445
00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:00,890
Hurry.

446
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:05,810
He's dead.

447
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:10,250
Who killed her?

448
00:26:27,890 --> 00:26:28,500
How could it be?

449
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:36,780
Don't be nervous, Your Excellency.

450
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:42,720
Miss Xiaorou.

451
00:26:45,590 --> 00:26:46,230
It's you.

452
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:50,780
Demons deserve to die!

453
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:54,170
The whole clan will be in danger unless we do it.

454
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:01,380
Take this for me.

455
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:08,700
Yang,

456
00:27:10,850 --> 00:27:11,550
over there.

457
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:15,120
Did I say something wrong last night?

458
00:27:15,170 --> 00:27:16,585
Uncle Yang asked me to pick vegetables.

459
00:27:16,585 --> 00:27:17,340
I'll leave first.

460
00:27:19,310 --> 00:27:20,200
About to

461
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:20,530
uncle Yang.

462
00:27:20,530 --> 00:27:21,480
Let's pick the vegetables.

463
00:27:32,050 --> 00:27:32,600
Little Yao.

464
00:27:32,890 --> 00:27:34,040
Don't go so fast.

465
00:27:36,670 --> 00:27:37,550
Give me that one.

466
00:27:37,690 --> 00:27:38,300
General.

467
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:40,460
I want to go hunting with you.

468
00:27:41,250 --> 00:27:43,030
And collect spices.

469
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:46,180
Well

470
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:48,250
thank you, General.

471
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:57,250
The villagers left in a hurry

472
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,320
they didn't even have time to dig the vegetables.

473
00:28:01,050 --> 00:28:01,840
What a pity.

474
00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:06,520
She hates monsters so much.

475
00:28:07,770 --> 00:28:08,170
I

476
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:10,180
miss Yan'er,

477
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:11,770
Is something bothering you?

478
00:28:13,530 --> 00:28:14,350
Here is the thing.

479
00:28:14,910 --> 00:28:17,540
A girl at home wrote me a letter.

480
00:28:17,540 --> 00:28:19,480
She told me that she fell in love with someone who can't bear any result.

481
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:22,660
I don't know if I should persuade him to let it go.

482
00:28:27,690 --> 00:28:29,560
People are born to die.

483
00:28:31,230 --> 00:28:32,830
No matter for rich or poor,

484
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,270
the result is doomed.

485
00:28:34,770 --> 00:28:36,080
If we only care about the result,

486
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:37,180
It's going to be very hard.

487
00:28:37,890 --> 00:28:39,310
Take this cabbage for example.

488
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:41,050
Even through all the hardships,

489
00:28:41,130 --> 00:28:42,910
she will still try to absorb the sunlight

490
00:28:43,530 --> 00:28:44,770
that's how she's grown so well.

491
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,780
Miss, don't think too much.

492
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:48,550
Just cherish the present

493
00:28:48,750 --> 00:28:49,990
and enjoy the process.

494
00:28:51,990 --> 00:28:53,860
-Thank you, Mr. Yang. -Hello.

495
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:58,510
Look how beautiful she is.

496
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:00,700
It's a tiger.

497
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:04,150
Tiger.

498
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,110
What happened to you?

499
00:29:06,030 --> 00:29:07,450
The young lady went hunting with us,

500
00:29:07,650 --> 00:29:09,250
but she got hurt

501
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:10,330
and I'm injured.

502
00:29:12,810 --> 00:29:14,350
Lord Lao is nowhere to be.

503
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:15,970
The general has asked us several times.

504
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:20,420
Yes

505
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:22,850
young Lady,

506
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:24,480
I've brought you some medicine.

507
00:29:24,710 --> 00:29:25,560
I left it at the door.

508
00:29:30,290 --> 00:29:31,050
Little girl,

509
00:29:31,610 --> 00:29:32,370
are you alright?

510
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:35,970
Little girl.

511
00:29:37,910 --> 00:29:38,610
Miss,

512
00:29:42,290 --> 00:29:43,200
I'll ask for help.

513
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:43,980
General.

514
00:29:45,050 --> 00:29:46,740
I really can't reach my wound.

515
00:29:47,270 --> 00:29:48,720
Can you apply the medicine for me?

516
00:29:50,150 --> 00:29:51,390
It really hurts!

517
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:04,350
Bear with it.

518
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:14,580
Thank you.

519
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:15,210
General.

520
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:16,710
You went hunting with us.

521
00:30:16,910 --> 00:30:18,720
We didn't take good care of you, so you got hurt.

522
00:30:30,650 --> 00:30:32,310
Since my parents passed away,

523
00:30:33,590 --> 00:30:35,340
no one has ever treated me this well.

524
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:42,270
After my parents passed away,

525
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:44,665
but I heard from Little Yao that

526
00:30:44,665 --> 00:30:44,940
you

527
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:47,730
sorry, General.

528
00:30:48,770 --> 00:30:50,160
I lied to Little Yao.

529
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:53,040
I'm not the legitimate daughter of the greenhouse.

530
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:56,760
When I was young, I used to be a daughter of my parents.

531
00:30:58,400 --> 00:30:59,970
But when I was 12 years old,

532
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:02,550
there was a demon,

533
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:06,880
takes the human form and stays overnight at my house.

534
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:08,045
Read quiet!

535
00:31:08,045 --> 00:31:09,460
They killed my whole family.

536
00:31:09,870 --> 00:31:11,110
Another odious monster.

537
00:31:14,070 --> 00:31:14,480
Luckily,

538
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:15,430
I hid in the water tank

539
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:17,940
so I escaped.

540
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:21,640
After my family was ruined,

541
00:31:23,330 --> 00:31:24,840
I was forced to be homeless.

542
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:30,330
I'm just the son of a willow in Qingjian.

543
00:31:32,270 --> 00:31:34,350
I don't deserve your love.

544
00:31:36,430 --> 00:31:37,820
So the past is the past.

545
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:41,750
You still need to look forward.

546
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:44,340
Have a good rest.

547
00:31:45,590 --> 00:31:46,200
General.

548
00:31:46,970 --> 00:31:49,470
I've heard that after they were cornered,

549
00:31:49,790 --> 00:31:51,450
his friends would take the shape of human

550
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:53,280
and take the opportunity to infiltrate the crowd

551
00:31:54,450 --> 00:31:55,570
and rescue them out.

552
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:57,850
That would happen?

553
00:31:59,130 --> 00:32:05,260
Who knows if it is humans or monsters beside us?

554
00:32:06,690 --> 00:32:07,600
Or demons beside us?

555
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:16,630
Come here.

556
00:32:16,650 --> 00:32:17,320
General.

557
00:32:20,610 --> 00:32:21,340
General.

558
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:34,920
I heard you were injured.

559
00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:37,770
Miss.

560
00:32:45,950 --> 00:32:46,615
Miss Little Yao.

561
00:32:46,615 --> 00:32:47,400
Please don't misunderstand.

562
00:32:48,610 --> 00:32:49,035
General.

563
00:32:49,035 --> 00:32:51,260
He just came to give me the medicine.

564
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:52,370
I'll be fine after eating.

565
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:54,320
It's an unfortunate timing.

566
00:32:55,510 --> 00:32:56,750
I brought you the medicine.

567
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:06,440
Listen to me.

568
00:33:13,030 --> 00:33:14,420
I just brought the medicine to the door.

569
00:33:14,650 --> 00:33:15,435
His wound couldn't reach it.

570
00:33:15,435 --> 00:33:16,130
So I went in.

571
00:33:25,230 --> 00:33:26,350
We are just friends.

572

To share the story with others.

579
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:11,600
Old people and monsters are so different.

580
00:34:13,450 --> 00:34:14,840
If we are not from the same kind of people,

581
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:18,230
why did you arrange for us to meet?

582

Miss You has left.

593
00:35:32,950 --> 00:35:34,250
Something got into my room.

594
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:35,810
Qiao escaped the temple.

595
00:36:01,150 --> 00:36:02,330
No matter who did this,

596
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:04,400
I will avenge you.

597
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,730
The wound is not man-made.

598
00:36:09,020 --> 00:36:10,350
It might be done by a monster.

599
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:24,850
Isn't this the previous debt collection?

600
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:43,990
Isn't this the lizard spirit Little Yao mentioned?

601
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:45,490
Why is it still alive?

602
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:50,380
Sorry.

603
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:53,230
I just wanted to cure these medicines.

604
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,360
I didn't expect it would become this medicine.

605
00:36:55,650 --> 00:36:57,130
To save them.

606
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:01,560
What do you mean by that?

607
00:37:02,150 --> 00:37:03,630
Humans and monsters are not compatible.

608
00:37:05,090 --> 00:37:06,600
Monsters can't be kind.

609
00:37:08,910 --> 00:37:10,330
Don't you know that?

610
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:24,300
I'm a warrior.

611
00:37:24,770 --> 00:37:25,650
Have only bare necessities at home

612
00:37:26,210 --> 00:37:28,590
just give you this knife.

613
00:37:35,990 --> 00:37:36,750
Miss Little Yao.

614
00:37:36,890 --> 00:37:37,710
Are you alright?

615
00:37:40,670 --> 00:37:41,550
Can you believe me?

616
00:37:42,410 --> 00:37:44,280
I applied the middle belt well.

617
00:37:45,190 --> 00:37:48,675
Demons wouldn't have got out.

618
00:37:48,675 --> 00:37:50,210
The weather these two days

619
00:37:50,530 --> 00:37:52,250
It was either windy or rainy.

620
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:54,780
And Dairin was killed,

621
00:37:55,250 --> 00:37:56,310
general is heartbroken.

622
00:37:57,470 --> 00:37:58,980
I hope you can understand.

623
00:37:59,270 --> 00:38:00,720
You help us get rid of the demons.

624
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:01,800
Go through fire and water

625
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:03,330
we all saw it.

626
00:38:04,230 --> 00:38:06,430
It's just Xiaorou.

627
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:09,550
What's wrong with Xiaorou?

628
00:38:10,890 --> 00:38:12,430
Something's wrong with her identity.

629
00:38:12,870 --> 00:38:14,980
So I asked someone to inquire about him.

630
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:16,600
The truth is,

631
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:19,750
the Nanhai Greenhouse was destroyed.

632
00:38:20,370 --> 00:38:22,960
There is no legitimate daughter at all.

633
00:38:23,340 --> 00:38:25,510
Have you told the General about this?

634
00:38:25,620 --> 00:38:27,040
I was going to.

635
00:38:27,210 --> 00:38:28,390
But if this happens,

636
00:38:30,730 --> 00:38:31,700
I'm on it.

637
00:38:51,530 --> 00:38:52,530
Given what has happened,

638
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:55,440
your comrades in the army were full of complaints against you.

639
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:57,300
They are upset

640
00:38:58,700 --> 00:39:00,150
you might as well withdraw from the project

641
00:39:01,370 --> 00:39:03,480
and to save some face.

642
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:04,950
So you're trying to force me to leave.

643
00:39:06,170 --> 00:39:07,170
Who on earth are you?

644
00:39:08,020 --> 00:39:09,330
The incidents that happened recently

645
00:39:10,340 --> 00:39:11,610
were related to you?

646
00:39:13,070 --> 00:39:14,070
So what?

647
00:39:14,810 --> 00:39:15,930
So what if it's not?

648
00:39:18,610 --> 00:39:20,450
Does anyone still believe you now?

649
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:22,220
Will the General believe you?

650
00:39:24,330 --> 00:39:26,500
Yan'er shares the same interests as you,

651
00:39:27,090 --> 00:39:28,690
I believe whatever you say,

652
00:39:29,580 --> 00:39:30,620
no matter what you do,

653
00:39:30,620 --> 00:39:31,600
It won't be your fault.

654
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:34,130
How about you?

655
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:37,240
If you don't have something hard to tell,

656
00:39:38,870 --> 00:39:40,320
why don't you agree

657
00:39:41,010 --> 00:39:42,460
how come you knew

658
00:39:43,270 --> 00:39:44,420
the words I spoke with?

659
00:39:51,580 --> 00:39:52,460
You are a spirit.

660
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:54,530
What are you doing?

661
00:39:56,710 --> 00:39:57,260
Miss.

662
00:39:57,430 --> 00:39:58,250
Are you alright?

663
00:39:59,380 --> 00:40:00,590
Why are you so strong?

664
00:40:01,690 --> 00:40:02,480
She's a demon.

665
00:40:02,770 --> 00:40:03,800
She's lying to you.

666
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:05,115
Miss Little Yao.

667
00:40:05,115 --> 00:40:05,960
What are you talking about?

668
00:40:06,310 --> 00:40:08,090
Why you framed Miss Xiaorou.

669
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:11,660
Could it be that Little Yao has misunderstood you and me?

670
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:15,420
There is nothing between you and me.

671
00:40:15,770 --> 00:40:16,590
You're still pretending.

672
00:40:17,030 --> 00:40:19,020
You weren't the legitimate daughter of Wen clan,

673
00:40:19,220 --> 00:40:20,730
your identity is fake.

674
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:23,490
I know I was born in a brothel.

675
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:25,740
And a man of lowliness.

676
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:30,040
But why should you return it to the hall of monsters?

677
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:39,070
Prove me as a monster if you dare.

678
00:40:52,850 --> 00:40:54,390
They don't believe me?

679
00:41:02,130 --> 00:41:02,950
Look after the demonic mirror.

680
00:41:26,060 --> 00:41:26,640
Little Yao.

681
00:41:28,410 --> 00:41:28,745
Actually,

682
00:41:28,745 --> 00:41:29,710
I trust you.

683
00:41:31,620 --> 00:41:32,980
But lately, so many strange things have happened.

684
00:41:34,050 --> 00:41:35,800
I need to give you an explanation.

685
00:41:37,270 --> 00:41:38,360
When I find the evidence,

686
00:41:39,020 --> 00:41:40,410
I will clear your name.

687
00:41:46,810 --> 00:41:47,330
Little Yao.

688
00:42:10,430 --> 00:42:11,250
Little Yao.

689
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:13,080
Little Yao.

690
00:42:13,970 --> 00:42:14,730
You are back

691
00:42:15,140 --> 00:42:16,260
the general is looking for you.

692
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:19,040
With this demon detector,

693
00:42:19,630 --> 00:42:22,760
you can see what you mean by Miss Rou

694
00:42:22,930 --> 00:42:24,020
miss Rou through this.

695
00:42:44,130 --> 00:42:44,780
I mustn't look at indecent things.

696
00:42:44,780 --> 00:42:45,430
I mustn't look at indecent things.

697
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:46,055
Young Lady,

698
00:42:46,055 --> 00:42:46,630
I am not the reason.

699
00:43:05,670 --> 00:43:06,400
Legend has it that

700
00:43:07,530 --> 00:43:10,318
there was a spiritual flower in the world,

701
00:43:10,318 --> 00:43:14,020
which turns into twins when it gathers full its energy.

702
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:16,810
But one day,

703
00:43:17,730 --> 00:43:19,390
one of the Spirit Fruits

704
00:43:20,550 --> 00:43:21,580
he left.

705
00:43:24,130 --> 00:43:25,700
And got my body shape.

706
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:28,220
The other is left behind.

707
00:43:30,970 --> 00:43:34,280
From now on, one is pure and flawless

708
00:43:35,380 --> 00:43:39,260
while the other can only survive with bloodlust.

709
00:43:44,380 --> 00:43:46,040
Son, Sis,

710
00:43:46,630 --> 00:43:47,690
don't you think so?

711
00:43:48,820 --> 00:43:49,490
Sis,

712
00:44:06,860 --> 00:44:07,120
alright.

713
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:07,740
What are you doing?

714
00:44:09,650 --> 00:44:10,230
Sister,

715
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:13,110
she found out our sisters' secret

716
00:44:14,150 --> 00:44:15,360
after she knows our secret?

717
00:44:31,910 --> 00:44:42,690
A tiger tiger demon.

718
00:44:43,940 --> 00:44:46,660
Tian Zhang Hu, General Zhang.

719
00:44:46,660 --> 00:44:47,400
How are you?

720
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:50,485
Right?

721
00:44:50,485 --> 00:44:51,690
Is it the knife that belongs to you?

722
00:44:52,060 --> 00:44:52,530
What?

723
00:44:52,580 --> 00:44:53,940
How did it hurt Zhang Hu?

724
00:44:54,020 --> 00:44:54,630
General.

725
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:55,650
General.

726
00:44:55,850 --> 00:44:56,335
General.

727
00:44:56,335 --> 00:44:57,150
Please save me.

728
00:44:59,220 --> 00:44:59,915
Miss Yan'er.

729
00:44:59,915 --> 00:45:02,170
She wants to kill my son.

730
00:45:03,030 --> 00:45:03,790
What happened?

731
00:45:04,850 --> 00:45:06,390
Lian'er doesn't dare to kill spirits,

732
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:08,160
how can she kill anyone?

733
00:45:09,170 --> 00:45:09,780
Because...

734
00:45:11,420 --> 00:45:12,870
Because he is a demon.

735
00:45:16,610 --> 00:45:19,590
Death, demon. Unexpectedly, a demon girl has been lying in wait for us.

736
00:45:19,820 --> 00:45:20,790
Yes, General.

737
00:45:20,810 --> 00:45:22,230
He must have been the one behind what happened to brother Hu.

738
00:45:22,310 --> 00:45:23,020
The death of Dadao

739
00:45:23,020 --> 00:45:24,150
broadsword's death.

740
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:29,020
You are a demon.

741

742
00:45:35,635 --> 00:45:36,390
yet you still want your life.

743
00:46:09,450 --> 00:46:11,143

00:47:24,710 --> 00:47:26,670
In a trance.

761
00:47:27,050 --> 00:47:28,675
♫ And missing you ♫

762
00:47:28,675 --> 00:47:31,140
♪ Your body I will ♪

763
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:32,420
For a long time

764
00:47:35,170 --> 00:47:37,250
I don't dare to be Wang Tiansheng.

765
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:41,300
I don't care if others like it or not.

766
00:47:42,370 --> 00:47:43,790
I just want to ask you.

767
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:46,460
Do you like me?

768
00:48:01,940 --> 00:48:03,330
No wonder the villagers have disappeared.

769
00:48:06,220 --> 00:48:07,010
Xiaorou,

770
00:48:21,130 --> 00:48:22,160
I want you to leave.

771
00:48:23,710 --> 00:48:26,660
Why do you still reflect on yourself?

772
00:48:28,510 --> 00:48:29,240
Rou,

773
00:48:31,330 --> 00:48:32,450
why did this witch

774
00:48:33,610 --> 00:48:35,900
with a mirror?

775
00:48:39,940 --> 00:48:41,540
Why did he kill Zhang Hu

776
00:48:43,050 --> 00:48:44,680
but leave you the witness?

777
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:47,530
And made a scene.

778
00:48:48,750 --> 00:48:49,810
All the villagers

779
00:48:50,990 --> 00:48:51,955
and strange things

780
00:48:51,955 --> 00:48:53,010
are related to you.

781
00:49:05,750 --> 00:49:07,020
So what if a demon is?

782
00:49:08,270 --> 00:49:11,910
Do you still like this demon?

783
00:49:12,740 --> 00:49:13,860
Even if he is a demon,

784
00:49:14,930 --> 00:49:15,960
a good one.

785
00:49:17,360 --> 00:49:18,270
To stay still with you.

786
00:49:20,690 --> 00:49:22,050
Who would have known that

787
00:49:23,150 --> 00:49:24,570
he is still defending him.

788
00:49:25,670 --> 00:49:27,630
As expected, she truly loves him.

789
00:49:30,230 --> 00:49:32,880
If Kunlun has the same heart,

790
00:49:33,710 --> 00:49:35,490
a sincere heart is what I want.

791
00:49:57,160 --> 00:49:57,740
Master,

792
00:49:58,360 --> 00:50:01,490
before you asked me to leave, didn't you say that I was possessed?

793
00:50:01,930 --> 00:50:02,630
Why?

794
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:05,910
Once General comes,

795
00:50:05,910 --> 00:50:06,920
we will recover the barbarians.

796
00:50:07,270 --> 00:50:08,910
I don't know what happened to the monsters we met.

797
00:50:08,910 --> 00:50:12,290
Can you stay and help us eliminate demons?

798
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:13,400
Of course.

799
00:50:13,720 --> 00:50:15,830
But I have something urgent to do now.

800
00:50:16,540 --> 00:50:17,540
I hope to catch the next time.

801
00:50:26,270 --> 00:50:26,850
Master.

802
00:50:27,050 --> 00:50:28,020
What happened to Qi?

803
00:50:28,940 --> 00:50:30,660
His wife and son almost went astray.

804
00:50:31,430 --> 00:50:32,640
He is all right now.

805
00:50:32,840 --> 00:50:33,930
Don't worry.

806
00:50:36,340 --> 00:50:36,920
The youngest son.

807
00:50:37,210 --> 00:50:39,050
You have to cultivate into an adult first.

808
00:50:39,490 --> 00:50:40,670
It's your fortune.

809
00:50:41,590 --> 00:50:44,210
It's time to experience in the mortal world.

810
00:50:44,890 --> 00:50:47,240
Remember to do good deeds

811
00:50:47,470 --> 00:50:48,530
to benefit the people.

812
00:50:48,970 --> 00:50:51,680
Your cultivation won't fail.

813
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:54,530
Yes, I have followed your instruction carefully

814
00:50:54,790 --> 00:50:55,760
I will accomplish my mission.

815
00:50:59,410 --> 00:51:00,650
Where's my bracelet?

816
00:51:08,430 --> 00:51:10,900
Since you went down the mountain,

817
00:51:11,580 --> 00:51:14,020
qi has become more and more confused.

818
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:16,330
I was unprepared

819
00:51:16,470 --> 00:51:17,890
to break Jie Jie's

820
00:51:18,750 --> 00:51:19,630
unexpectedly,

821
00:51:19,770 --> 00:51:21,400
the Painted Skin Demon

822
00:51:22,830 --> 00:51:24,160
Is him.

823
00:51:26,130 --> 00:51:28,060
But what happened to him?

824
00:51:32,810 --> 00:51:34,020
Don't be sad.

825
00:51:35,930 --> 00:51:37,110
I just don't understand

826
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:41,340
why I have to share life and death

827
00:51:41,990 --> 00:51:43,230
In the world

828
00:51:45,070 --> 00:51:46,280
that they wouldn't believe me?

829
00:51:48,760 --> 00:51:49,730
Little fool.

830
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:53,000
Now that you've grown into a human,

831
00:51:53,320 --> 00:51:56,990
you have to accept the pain of love and separation

832
00:51:58,570 --> 00:52:01,455
to cherish others' happiness and misfortune

833
00:52:01,455 --> 00:52:03,350
with each other through life and death.

834
00:52:04,360 --> 00:52:09,590
It's a worthwhile trip to the human world.

835
00:52:15,940 --> 00:52:16,790
Little Yao.

836
00:52:17,230 --> 00:52:18,080
Little Yao.

837
00:52:19,120 --> 00:52:19,940
Little Yao.

838
00:52:21,550 --> 00:52:22,620
Miss Yang Shu. Little Yao.

839
00:52:22,620 --> 00:52:23,265
What happened?

840
00:52:23,265 --> 00:52:24,950
General asked me to leave with our men yesterday.

841
00:52:24,970 --> 00:52:26,210
He had to deal with something.

842
00:52:26,320 --> 00:52:27,360
I was worried.

843
00:52:27,360 --> 00:52:28,310
To find him.

844
00:52:28,630 --> 00:52:29,565
When I was back,

845
00:52:29,565 --> 00:52:31,610
I saw Xiaorou kidnapped the general.

846
00:52:31,630 --> 00:52:33,260
He also asked me to bring you a message.

847
00:52:34,030 --> 00:52:35,300
If you want to save General,

848
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:36,920
go to the mountain pass ten miles south.

849
00:52:38,350 --> 00:52:38,750
Son.

850
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:42,060
Master goes with you and burn him.

851
00:52:42,060 --> 00:52:42,300
Alright.

852
00:52:42,300 --> 00:52:42,920
I'll go with you.

853
00:52:43,300 --> 00:52:45,590
I'd better solve it myself.

854
00:52:45,640 --> 00:52:47,090
I want to give him another chance.

855
00:53:04,510 --> 00:53:05,960
I've finally made this day.

856
00:53:06,580 --> 00:53:07,520
July 15th.

857
00:53:07,960 --> 00:53:09,020
Sincerity is a must.

858
00:53:10,030 --> 00:53:12,530
I always thought sincerity was the heart.

859
00:53:13,780 --> 00:53:15,740
But I didn't expect that these two fools falling in love

860
00:53:17,050 --> 00:53:19,640
made me realize that there's another kind of sincerity.

861
00:53:20,470 --> 00:53:23,360
So, you did all this to get his heart

862
00:53:23,980 --> 00:53:25,070
to save him?

863
00:53:26,230 --> 00:53:27,290
Since you want to kill me,

864
00:53:27,940 --> 00:53:28,910
go ahead and kill me.

865
00:53:29,580 --> 00:53:30,500
What's the hurry?

866
00:53:31,100 --> 00:53:32,130
When everyone is here,

867
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:33,990
when they come.

868
00:53:42,560 --> 00:53:43,110
Son.

869
00:53:47,310 --> 00:53:47,890
Little sister,

870
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:49,810
I know that cultivating is not easy.

871
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:51,820
I didn't see you earlier.

872
00:53:52,140 --> 00:53:53,800
I didn't notice that you are possessed earlier.

873
00:53:55,020 --> 00:53:58,540
Just show me the sisterhood.

874
00:53:59,250 --> 00:54:00,610
I don't want anything from Shang and General.

875
00:54:01,620 --> 00:54:03,010
So you two are sisters.

876
00:54:03,900 --> 00:54:05,200
Drop your acting.

877
00:54:06,030 --> 00:54:07,150
Master teaches us

878
00:54:08,170 --> 00:54:10,070
to practice with hatred and resentment.

879
00:54:10,750 --> 00:54:12,320
I've always been following your instructions.

880
00:54:12,790 --> 00:54:14,480
I never meant to hurt you.

881
00:54:15,220 --> 00:54:15,980
How about you?

882
00:54:17,470 --> 00:54:19,550
When I was about to turn into the human form,

883
00:54:21,360 --> 00:54:23,020
when I was about to take the human form.

884
00:54:24,390 --> 00:54:26,140
You were jealous because I colluded with Kunlun.

885
00:54:26,820 --> 00:54:28,025
You even beat me up

886
00:54:28,025 --> 00:54:28,900
zhongshan Kunlun Mountain

887
00:54:29,910 --> 00:54:32,105
I saw you at the city that day.

888
00:54:32,105 --> 00:54:33,520
I knew

889
00:54:34,890 --> 00:54:36,850
there was finally a chance for me to seek revenge.

890
00:54:37,230 --> 00:54:38,830
I'll let you try

891
00:54:39,210 --> 00:54:41,320
how painful it is to lose your loved one.

892
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,630
Why did Master teach you this?

893
00:54:44,580 --> 00:54:46,060
I never hurt Kunlun.

894
00:54:46,830 --> 00:54:48,410
That day I shot down the gravel

895
00:54:48,410 --> 00:54:49,510
to distract them.

896
00:54:49,710 --> 00:54:50,590
Then let me ask you,

897
00:54:52,950 --> 00:54:54,130
the bracelet I gave you

898
00:54:55,950 --> 00:54:57,370
how could it be in Mount Kunlun?

899
00:54:58,770 --> 00:55:00,310
Don't try to explain.

900
00:55:01,470 --> 00:55:02,230
Master, it hurts!

901
00:55:02,580 --> 00:55:03,610
If the General spoils you,

902
00:55:04,230 --> 00:55:06,070
how can you remember me

903
00:55:06,510 --> 00:55:08,180
how can you remember me?

904
00:55:08,180 --> 00:55:10,210
I won't believe a word of you again.

905
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:31,930
This is Second's amulet.

906
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:35,860
Be careful

907
00:55:47,700 --> 00:55:49,210
It's not an amulet.

908
00:55:49,890 --> 00:55:51,280
Do you think it can protect you?

909
00:56:06,390 --> 00:56:07,570
An mortal.

910
00:56:07,740 --> 00:56:08,950
How dare you fight back?

911
00:56:11,010 --> 00:56:12,370
I'll grant your wish.

912
00:56:23,850 --> 00:56:25,393
I don't care whether

913
00:56:25,393 --> 00:56:26,620
whether others believe me or not.

914
00:56:28,200 --> 00:56:29,500
I just want to ask you one thing.

915
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:31,660
You trust me?

916
00:56:41,270 --> 00:56:42,000
Meet each other.

917
00:56:44,930 --> 00:56:45,330
Where

918
00:56:47,330 --> 00:56:48,150
pay attention.

919
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:48,600
Lift up!

920
00:56:55,220 --> 00:56:55,890
I can't.

921
00:57:06,990 --> 00:57:08,140
Convey my true self

922
00:57:58,850 --> 00:57:59,700
let them go.

923
00:58:01,340 --> 00:58:03,060
If you really can save Kunlun,

924
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:05,460
then take this heart of mine

925
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:08,340
don't!

926
00:58:35,110 --> 00:58:36,800
Now Kunlun is like this,

927
00:58:38,410 --> 00:58:39,860
now you're pretending to be a good person.

928
00:58:57,220 --> 00:58:57,425
Yes

929
00:58:57,425 --> 00:58:58,130
It is not him.

930
00:58:59,500 --> 00:59:00,230
Your wound?

931
00:59:02,200 --> 00:59:03,530
Because of my cowardice.

932
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:06,020
In this life,

933
00:59:08,350 --> 00:59:09,890
no matter you're human or demon,

934
00:59:12,120 --> 00:59:13,780
I'll tell you what happened.

935
00:59:16,530 --> 00:59:17,740
I want to invite you in my heart.

936
00:59:20,610 --> 00:59:21,760
From first to last

937
00:59:24,780 --> 00:59:25,180
4.

938
00:59:39,060 --> 00:59:39,460
Sleepy...

939
00:59:42,180 --> 00:59:45,160
I can finally be with you again.

940
00:59:57,210 --> 00:59:58,270
Give me back my money.

941
00:59:58,320 --> 00:59:59,500
I'll let him go to Kunlun.

942
01:00:11,310 --> 01:00:11,950
For what?

943
01:00:12,750 --> 01:00:15,010
It's just an illusion.

944
01:00:15,270 --> 01:00:16,720
He was already dead.

945
01:00:27,310 --> 01:00:27,920
Don't.

946
01:00:29,950 --> 01:00:40,910
Happy!

947
01:00:42,730 --> 01:00:45,380
With a conscience and a conscience.

948
01:00:46,360 --> 01:00:49,160
With no regard for human relations.

949
01:00:50,030 --> 01:00:51,240
And gave birth to Demon Lotus.

950
01:00:51,440 --> 01:00:52,650
The yin and yang of two genders,

951
01:00:53,630 --> 01:00:55,980
can unite the six realms.

952
01:00:57,470 --> 01:00:58,590
For today,

953
01:00:59,120 --> 01:01:01,320
I've planned things for hundreds of years

954
01:01:29,810 --> 01:01:30,780
and Her Majesty's cultivation

955
01:01:31,100 --> 01:01:32,820
and fell short of success.

956
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:35,940
But I didn't expect that

957
01:01:36,440 --> 01:01:39,270
the Holy Flower would break into two.

958
01:01:39,290 --> 01:01:40,740
And survived.

959
01:01:41,690 --> 01:01:44,700
I will take the remaining flowers to Jinguang Cave

960
01:01:44,810 --> 01:01:46,230
and take good care of it.

961
01:01:47,120 --> 01:01:48,210
July 15th.

962
01:01:48,860 --> 01:01:50,170
I just want to read

963
01:01:50,200 --> 01:01:51,270
that they'd

964
01:01:58,820 --> 01:01:59,940
so you were the one

965
01:02:01,320 --> 01:02:02,590
who cooked all these.

966
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:05,470
It's too late to know now.

967
01:02:28,050 --> 01:02:29,350
Give it back to me!

968
01:03:13,550 --> 01:03:16,020
Do you really think you can beat me?

969
01:03:23,780 --> 01:03:25,230
We are at odds.

970
01:03:28,880 --> 01:03:31,020
I wanted to separate you two

971
01:03:31,250 --> 01:03:32,940
and kill you one by one.

972
01:03:34,280 --> 01:03:36,630
Don't be afraid.

973
01:03:36,950 --> 01:03:37,920
Hold my hand.

974
01:03:38,600 --> 01:03:40,410
He doesn't want us to fight him together.

975
01:03:47,540 --> 01:03:47,940
Sis.

976
01:04:06,080 --> 01:04:07,020
That's impossible.

977
01:04:07,970 --> 01:04:09,930
What can you do together?

978
01:04:19,490 --> 01:04:23,065
You're nothing but a tool that I cultivated.

979
01:04:23,065 --> 01:04:24,510
You want to backfire on me?

980
01:04:46,060 --> 01:04:47,120
What's your name

981
01:04:48,010 --> 01:04:49,280
It's none of your business

982
01:04:55,920 --> 01:04:56,710
what's wrong?

983
01:05:18,480 --> 01:05:18,880
What...

984
01:05:37,140 --> 01:05:38,645
Give birth every day?

985
01:05:38,645 --> 01:05:39,340
Are you alright?

986
01:05:41,010 --> 01:05:41,620
From Tiansheng.

987
01:05:45,210 --> 01:05:45,820
Born

988
01:05:50,110 --> 01:05:51,020
In this life,

989
01:05:53,670 --> 01:05:55,955
I have never wronged you.

990
01:05:55,955 --> 01:05:56,620
Nothing.

991
01:05:57,690 --> 01:05:58,930
What kind of life?

992
01:05:59,970 --> 01:06:02,770
I just want you to stay by my side in this life.

993
01:06:17,410 --> 01:06:26,840
Born to be.

994
01:06:28,990 --> 01:06:29,930
Come back!

995
01:06:30,940 --> 01:06:32,060
Come back!

996
01:06:48,880 --> 01:06:52,460
Now you're no longer manipulated by demonic men.

997
01:06:53,530 --> 01:06:56,060
I order you to continue

998
01:06:56,900 --> 01:06:58,830
and continue your cultivation.

999
01:07:01,270 --> 01:07:02,480
I can't write

1000
01:07:03,850 --> 01:07:06,740
♫ A infatuated young man ♫

1001
01:07:09,640 --> 01:07:14,060
Can't finish a relationship.

1002
01:07:17,980 --> 01:07:18,380
The

1003
01:07:20,440 --> 01:07:21,150
we met.

1004
01:07:21,150 --> 01:07:23,720
I didn't owe you anything.

1005
01:07:25,690 --> 01:07:26,960
I will bear in mind

1006
01:07:30,790 --> 01:07:34,760
chest

1007
01:07:36,430 --> 01:07:41,540
♫ I won't forget your invincible military uniform ♫

1008
01:07:44,680 --> 01:07:49,700
You can't help falling in love.

1009
01:07:52,930 --> 01:07:53,930
I will.

1010
01:07:55,060 --> 01:07:57,320
Please give me another chance.

1011
01:08:01,260 --> 01:08:02,240
I won't let you down.

1012
01:08:04,180 --> 01:08:05,120
In this world,

1013
01:08:07,690 --> 01:08:09,080
I didn't betray you.

1014
01:08:38,740 --> 01:08:39,560
Is this a dream?

1015
01:08:42,580 --> 01:08:43,005
It was a dream.

1016
01:08:43,005 --> 01:08:45,260
Is it not a dream important?

1017
01:08:49,760 --> 01:08:50,400
You need to

1018
01:08:51,650 --> 01:08:52,470
as long as you're here,

1019
01:08:53,660 --> 01:08:57,000
♪ I looked at the past ♪

1020
01:09:00,170 --> 01:09:01,200

there is.

1022
01:09:04,310 --> 01:09:06,570
♪ I can't cut it ♪

But not a complete picture.

1025
01:09:24,110 --> 01:09:30,180
But you can't finish reading a complicated love letter.

1026
01:09:33,320 --> 01:09:35,760
♪ The dream is bleak ♪

1027
01:09:37,010 --> 01:09:39,510
The hot tears are burning.

1028
01:09:41,600 --> 01:09:46,680
I toss and turn to you in the night.

1029
01:09:50,930 --> 01:09:53,770
He can't forget you.

1030
01:09:53,800 --> 01:09:56,010
The iron horse Ruozhou

01:09:59,180 --> 01:10:04,320
♫ Can't you lose your hair ♫

01:10:43,700 --> 01:10:44,100
tears

1039
01:10:45,200 --> 01:10:48,690
falling crazily...

1040
01:10:51,470 --> 01:10:51,870
Fall!
