4
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:47,150
I went to the ancestral hall

5
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:48,479
to worship Confucius by the way.

6
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:49,660
I pray you

7
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:50,750

8
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:53,539
But someone crazy

9
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:55,140
threw a book in through the window

10
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:56,140
and hit my head.

11
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,440
It still hurts.

12
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:08,860
Why are you looking at me like that?

13
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:11,420
Didn't you say

14
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:12,550

15

Are you out of your mind?

16
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:20,220
I said it was a dream.

Understand?

19
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:25,730
Yes.

20
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:27,720

21

You just said it.

22
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:30,960
I was distracted.

How is that possible?

37
00:02:57,860 --> 00:02:58,820

Bored. I have no appetite.

So you can't stand loneliness?

you dismissed all the old servants.

How is that possible?

178
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:06,610
So you hate him.

179
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:07,420
Yes.

180
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:09,250
I wish I could kill him.

181
00:10:18,810 --> 00:10:19,570
He's not the murderer.

182
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:21,010
He probably doesn't know

183
00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:22,030
Liu Youqiu is dead.

184
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:23,100
Don’t scare him.

185
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:23,820
Ask him patiently.

186
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:24,860
Try to see

187
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:26,360
if we can find any new clues.

188
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:27,870
Minister Lu,

189
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:29,400
this beggar is a tricky one.

190
00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:30,880
Don't be fooled by him

191
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:31,990
and miss the real murderer.

192
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:33,730
Not to mention killing someone,

193
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:35,150
I'm afraid

194
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:36,920
he can't get out of this woodshed.

195
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:39,140
Ask him who is Ji Xiang.

196
00:10:42,570 --> 00:10:43,980
He is the one who found the body first.

197
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:50,500
I'm Ji Xiang.

198
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:51,600
Greetings, my lords.

199
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:53,560
When did you find the body?

200
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:56,970
[The Servant of the Confucian Temple]

201
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:57,540
At 5 p.m. yesterday.

202
00:10:58,070 --> 00:10:59,060
5 o'clock?

203
00:11:01,890 --> 00:11:02,760
Are you sure?

204
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:03,980
Yes.

205
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:06,040
Every day at 5 p.m.,

206
00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:07,610
I would prepare the dishes

207
00:11:08,090 --> 00:11:09,680
and deliver to them on time.

208
00:11:10,090 --> 00:11:10,750
I always do.

209
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:12,460
But last evening,

210
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:14,870
I found no one when I delivered the meal to the eastern hall.

211
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:16,730
So I called them to dinner.

212
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:34,130
My lords,

213
00:11:34,690 --> 00:11:35,850
the dinner is ready.

214
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,570
You can have the meal in the eastern hall.

215
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:47,110
My lords…

216
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:52,470
Was Dugu Xiashu

217
00:11:52,490 --> 00:11:53,510
absent from the Confucian temple all yesterday?

218
00:11:56,430 --> 00:11:57,680
He was there at lunch.

219
00:11:58,530 --> 00:11:59,360
He said, after lunch,

220
00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:01,730
he would buy some books at the Hangu bookstore in the eastern city.

221
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:05,200
Is there anybody else

222
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:06,130
in Dugu Xiashu's family?

223
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:07,570
He...

224
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:09,530
He has a wife,

225
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:10,540
and no children.

226
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:13,590
His wife occasionally comes to the Confucian temple,

227
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:14,920
bringing him some clothes to change.

228
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:18,650
Go on.

229
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:22,030
That's all.

230
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,000
That's all?

231
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:24,980
My son!

232
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:25,820
Master.

233
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:27,210
-Master. -My son.

234
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:27,870
Master.

235
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:29,620
Where is my son?

236
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:30,440
Master.

237
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:31,350
Where is he?

238
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:43,700
My little master.

239
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:45,420
My son!

240
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:47,660
My son!

241
00:12:47,690 --> 00:12:48,420
My little master.

242
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:50,670
-Why do you die before me? -Sir.

243
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:51,720
I'm sorry for you loss, sir.

244
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,160
Please get up.

245
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:54,160
Get up, sir.

246
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:56,740
You, you...

247
00:12:57,370 --> 00:12:59,030
My son studies in your Confucian temple.

248
00:12:59,370 --> 00:13:00,360
Now he's dead.

249
00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:02,100
Give my son back!

250
00:13:02,270 --> 00:13:04,270
Give my son back!

251
00:13:04,570 --> 00:13:06,110
My son!

252
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:10,060
Give my son back!

253
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:12,030
My son!

254
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:13,170
I'll find Dugu Xiashu.

255
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:29,110
Dugu Xiashu.

256
00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:29,890
Yes.

257
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:39,880
You're in a hurry.

258
00:13:40,290 --> 00:13:41,140
Where are you going?

259
00:13:44,050 --> 00:13:44,850
Who are you?

260
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:46,180
Why do you stop me?

261
00:13:46,610 --> 00:13:48,990
I'm Lu Lingfeng, the acting Minister of Justice.

262
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:50,680
The Minister of Justice?

263
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:52,980
What do you want from me?

264
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:54,640
Where are you going?

265
00:13:55,950 --> 00:13:56,300
I...

266
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:58,800
I'm going to Chang'an to prepare for the exam.

267
00:13:59,340 --> 00:13:59,930
What's wrong?

268
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:01,600
I heard that you lived in the Confucian temple alone,

269
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:02,390
studying hard for three years.

270
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:04,460
Today, why do you suddenly leave Nanzhou,

271
00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:05,550
to prepare for the exam in Chang'an?

272
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,160
Although you are an official,

273
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:09,380
I don't need to answer

274
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:10,750
this kind of question.

275
00:14:13,810 --> 00:14:14,720
What are you doing?

276
00:14:17,770 --> 00:14:18,740
Liu Youqiu is dead.

277
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:25,510
[The Nanzhou Prison]

278
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:28,540
My lords,

279
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:30,140
please catch the murderer

280
00:14:30,650 --> 00:14:31,970
and avenge my classmate.

281
00:14:32,770 --> 00:14:34,130
You don't go to Chang'an

282
00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:35,550
to prepare for the exam at any other time,

283
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:36,910
but you leave

284
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:37,760
after Liu Youqiu is killed.

285
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:39,420
Dugu xiashu,

286
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:41,080
what a coincidence.

287
00:14:41,810 --> 00:14:42,970
I failed twice before,

288
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:45,460
so I studied hard in Nanzhou for three years.

289
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:48,160
Now I'm confident.

290
00:14:48,650 --> 00:14:50,260
That's why I want to travel thousands of miles

291
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:52,610
to go to Chang'an early

292
00:14:52,930 --> 00:14:54,520
and prepare for the exam next spring.

293
00:14:55,330 --> 00:14:55,810
That's why...

294
00:14:55,830 --> 00:14:56,670
Let me ask you.

295
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,110
Yesterday, from lunch to 5 p.m.,

296
00:14:58,580 --> 00:14:59,490
where were you?

297
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:01,100
Because I planned

298
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:02,330
to go to Chang'an today,

299
00:15:02,730 --> 00:15:04,360
so yesterday, after lunch,

300
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:06,670
I went to the Hangu bookstore in the eastern city

301
00:15:07,130 --> 00:15:08,290
to buy some books.

302
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:10,010
It's a long journey to Chang'an,

303
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:11,430
so that I can read these books on the way.

304
00:15:11,650 --> 00:15:12,340
How long have you been there?

305
00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:14,470
When did you return to the Confucian temple?

306
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:17,330
The bookstore is not close to the Confucian temple.

307
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:19,400
It took me a lot of time.

308
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:21,170
After I bought these books,

309
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:22,980
I wanted to go back to the Confucian temple

310
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:24,580
and say goodbye to Liu Youqiu.

311
00:15:25,610 --> 00:15:28,010
But I remembered that

312
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:29,890
he didn't approve of my going to Chang'an.

313
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:32,180
So I thought about it for a moment,

314
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:33,760
then turned around halfway

315
00:15:34,170 --> 00:15:35,260
and went straight home.

316
00:15:37,590 --> 00:15:38,690
Juren Dugu.

317
00:15:39,650 --> 00:15:41,700
Where is your wife?

318
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:45,960
Since I go to Chang'an for the exam,

319
00:15:46,410 --> 00:15:48,530
I couldn't go home until next spring or summer at the earliest.

320
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:51,280
So my wife, Qinghong,

321
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:53,690
went back to her maiden home this morning.

322
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:56,950
If I pass the exam next year,

323
00:15:57,550 --> 00:15:58,640
I'll bring her back.

324
00:16:00,090 --> 00:16:00,940
But if I fail,

325
00:16:02,030 --> 00:16:03,380
I'm too ashamed to pick her up.

326
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:04,640
There are…

327
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:13,500
There are all mountain roads between Nanzhou and He County,

328
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:15,090
which are far and dangerous.

329
00:16:15,990 --> 00:16:17,690
Your wife goes back to her maiden home,

330
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:20,050
but why don't you see her off?

331
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,150
Qinghong is a tough woman.

332
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:24,790
Every time she goes back to her maiden home,

333
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:26,970
she wears a hood

334
00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:28,570
and leaves alone.

335
00:16:29,070 --> 00:16:30,680
In order to get a good score,

336
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:32,850
you live in the Confucian temple all the year round.

337
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:35,800
You even don't see your wife off when she goes back to her maiden home.

338
00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:39,300
For you,

339
00:16:39,650 --> 00:16:41,080
Qinghong is not important.

340
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:43,860
I have concentrated on books.

341
00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:45,030
So…

342
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:48,820
You just mentioned Liu Youqiu.

343
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:50,610
He objected to your going to Changsha to study for the exam.

344
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:52,620
Did you two ever have a quarrel

345
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:54,300
about this?

346
00:16:59,190 --> 00:17:00,240
Yes.

347
00:17:01,010 --> 00:17:01,620
But...

348
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:03,050
that was a few days ago.

349
00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:04,829
These days,

350
00:17:04,970 --> 00:17:05,880
we have ignored each other.

351
00:17:06,450 --> 00:17:07,349
What about yesterday?

352
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,369
Before you left the Confucian temple,

353
00:17:10,599 --> 00:17:12,550
did you quarrel with him?

354
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:16,440
Y-Yesterday...

355
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:19,710
Y-Yesterday...

356
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:22,420
I can't remember what happened yesterday.

357
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:23,210
What?

358
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:24,829
How can you forget the things that happened yesterday?

359
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:26,700
Don't think you are a Juren,

360
00:17:27,050 --> 00:17:28,640
so you can talk nonsense in front of the minister.

361
00:17:30,610 --> 00:17:31,690
It's been raining heavily lately.

362
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:33,780
It makes me feel absent-minded.

363
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:35,440
Let me think again.

364
00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:37,040
Let me think again.

365
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:38,400
Yesterday...

366
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:40,400
Yesterday...

367
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:43,430
We probably didn't quarrel yesterday.

368
00:17:48,010 --> 00:17:49,010
Probably?

369
00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:53,680
We definitely didn't quarrel yesterday.

370
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:56,030
I haven't killed Liu Youqiu.

371
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:57,400
I’m just a scholar.

372
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:59,450
Usually, I would run away from the scene of killing a chicken.

373
00:17:59,730 --> 00:18:01,100
How could I kill someone with my own hands?

374
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:06,160
These two things have no connection.

375
00:18:06,930 --> 00:18:09,110
Many murderers

376
00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:10,660
are cowards usually.

377
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:12,740
But in a certain situation,

378
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:15,660
they can be cruel and heartless.

379
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:21,100
I'm not saying

380
00:18:21,190 --> 00:18:22,270
you are the murderer.

381
00:18:23,090 --> 00:18:24,290
It is just

382
00:18:24,690 --> 00:18:26,400
a routine inquiry.

383
00:18:27,230 --> 00:18:28,010
Minister Lu.

384
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:30,030
I think we can let him go.

385
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:32,540
Commander Su,

386
00:18:32,770 --> 00:18:33,940
we can't let him go.

387
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:36,860
Here,

388
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,640
are you in charge

389
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:40,250
or am I?

390
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:43,650
Go.

391
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:49,370
But

392
00:18:50,550 --> 00:18:53,440
you can't leave Nanzhou

393
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:55,220
before the case is clear,

394
00:18:56,230 --> 00:18:58,480
no matter what reason you have.

395
00:18:59,510 --> 00:19:00,890
If you dare to run away,

396
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:03,110
we will arrest you immediately.

397
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:06,620
Got it.

398
00:19:09,810 --> 00:19:11,450
Commander Su, this man has a silver tongue,

399
00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:12,310
He is the most suspected one.

400
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:13,680
H-How can we let him go?

401
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:15,260
What's your opinion?

402
00:19:15,450 --> 00:19:16,270
We should execute severe punishments on him.

403
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:18,530
There are three kinds of solutions.

404
00:19:18,930 --> 00:19:19,640
Executing punishments

405
00:19:19,990 --> 00:19:21,090
is the most unwise one.

406
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:23,790
But...

407
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,230
But someone just deserves to be punished.

408
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,880
They won't confess unless you torture them.

409
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:29,210
Commander Su let him go,

410
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:30,910
which is more beneficial

411
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:31,840
for handling this case.

412
00:19:32,530 --> 00:19:33,020
Mr.Xie,

413
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:35,240
I asked you to keep an eye on Ouyang Quan last time,

414
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:35,970
you did a good job.

415
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:36,570
Go.

416
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:38,070
This time, it's Juren Dugu.

417
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:40,100
Don't let him know.

418
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:44,280
Got it.

419
00:19:44,610 --> 00:19:46,640
It turns out that you two

420
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:48,010
have already reached an agreement.

421
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,100
I-I'm the only fool.

422
00:19:51,650 --> 00:19:52,080
Go.

423
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:53,170
Yes.

424
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,470
It's an brilliant idea to let him go.

425
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:06,090
But with his shifty eyes,

426
00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:07,940
he must be up to something.

427
00:20:09,670 --> 00:20:11,290
You've observed carefully.

428
00:20:11,970 --> 00:20:15,360
That's why we have to pretend to let him go.

429
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:17,560
I'll go to He County

430
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:19,250
and bring Qinghong

431
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:19,810
back.

432
00:20:20,830 --> 00:20:22,520
You're so thoughtful.

433
00:20:23,010 --> 00:20:23,570
All right.

434
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:25,420
Let's not flatter each other.

435
00:20:26,170 --> 00:20:27,040
I just

436
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:28,180
understand

437
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:29,590
what you are thinking about.

438
00:20:36,810 --> 00:20:37,440
My sister?

439
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:39,290
She doesn't come back.

440
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:42,870
What happened to her?

441
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:44,300
Is something wrong?

442
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:46,060
Dugu Xiashu,

443
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:47,180
he is a bastard.

444
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:48,820
He always asks my sister

445
00:20:48,850 --> 00:20:49,620
to come back by herself.

446
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,410
From Nanzhou to HeCounty,

447
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:53,210
the mountain road is so dangerous.

448
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:55,160
How can he be at ease?

449
00:20:56,330 --> 00:20:57,140
If anything happens

450
00:20:57,330 --> 00:20:58,560
to my sister,

451
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:00,410
I will not spare him.

452
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:01,860
Are you the only relative she has

453
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:02,620
in He County?

454
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:06,470
Our parents died when we were young.

455
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:08,900
It was me who brought her up.

456
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:10,710
I thought she married

457
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:11,700
a scholar,

458
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:13,190
I can rest assured.

459
00:21:13,970 --> 00:21:14,650
Who could knew

460
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,010
Dugu Xiashu

461
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:19,100
treated her like this?

462
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:21,780
Why did you just say

463
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:23,560
the mountain road is dangerous?

464
00:21:24,910 --> 00:21:25,320
You...

465
00:21:25,850 --> 00:21:27,830
Don't you officials know?

466
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:36,370
Minister Lu.

467
00:21:36,490 --> 00:21:37,540
What are you doing?

468
00:21:37,690 --> 00:21:38,640
The mountain road is dangerous.

469
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:39,360
What happened?

470
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:41,410
There are bandits on this road.

471
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:42,740
They rob women,

472
00:21:43,390 --> 00:21:45,070
rape and kill them, and dump their bodies in the wild.

473
00:21:45,210 --> 00:21:45,980
At most,

474
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:47,660
there are over 10 cases a year.

475
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:48,600
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

476
00:21:49,050 --> 00:21:50,350
The mountain road is under He County's jurisdiction.

477
00:21:50,850 --> 00:21:52,130
Although we are from the city,

478
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:53,970
we can't arrest the murderer directly.

479
00:21:57,830 --> 00:21:59,500
Ridiculous!

480
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:14,120
How about this?

481
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:15,470
No, no.

482
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:16,610
You don't look like a woman.

483
00:22:16,730 --> 00:22:17,930
Practice with a woman's dress.

484
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:18,820
Yes.

485
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:19,950
Xue Huan disguised himself as a woman.

486
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:21,430
Even if he wears a long dress,

487
00:22:21,610 --> 00:22:22,880
it is easy to recognize that he is a man.

488
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:24,100
My lady,

489
00:22:24,210 --> 00:22:25,360
you are right.

490
00:22:27,730 --> 00:22:28,890
I heard everything.

491
00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:31,070
You want to use women

492
00:22:31,090 --> 00:22:31,690
to lure out the bandits,

493
00:22:31,990 --> 00:22:32,620
Since I'm here.

494
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:34,030
why are you bothering Xue Huan?

495
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:37,460
No way.

496
00:22:38,450 --> 00:22:39,990
How can I let you take this risk?

497
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:42,790
If you're worried,

498
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:44,120
you can let Xue Huan

499
00:22:44,150 --> 00:22:45,230
pretend to be my sister.

500
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:47,440
This way, Xue Huan can protect me

501
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:48,660
and prevent the bandits from being suspicious.

502
00:22:48,790 --> 00:22:49,300
What do you think?

503
00:22:50,610 --> 00:22:51,190
In that case,

504
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:53,020
we can definitely find Lady Dugu.

505
00:22:55,550 --> 00:22:57,250
Master, with your protection,

506
00:22:57,270 --> 00:22:58,590
we won't be in danger.

507
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:21,810
Mr. Woodcutter.

508
00:23:26,190 --> 00:23:28,480
How far is it from He County?

509
00:23:30,690 --> 00:23:31,520
Go faster.

510
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:32,500
Otherwise,

511
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:34,040
you can't get there before dark.

512
00:23:36,770 --> 00:23:37,600
Thank you.

513
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:39,800
Let's go.

514
00:23:53,210 --> 00:23:55,190
Fresh honey!

515
00:23:55,850 --> 00:23:57,560
Honey for sale!

516
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:58,140
Brother,

517
00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:00,480
how much is the honey?

518
00:24:01,550 --> 00:24:02,110
Ten copper coins per pot.

519
00:24:02,350 --> 00:24:02,790
Do you want it?

520
00:24:03,270 --> 00:24:03,760
Sure.

521
00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:04,600
Okay.

522
00:24:07,430 --> 00:24:08,390
I forgot to bring those pots.

523
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:09,660
Could you please

524
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:10,370
come with me?

525
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:12,350
Turn this corner and that's my home.

526
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:13,800
I'll ask my wife

527
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:14,990
to pack two pots of the best honey for you.

528
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:16,230
Great！

529
00:24:16,810 --> 00:24:17,190
Okay.

530
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:25,580
It's okay, sister.

531
00:24:25,990 --> 00:24:27,260
It's still early.

532
00:24:27,570 --> 00:24:28,810
After we buy the honey,

533
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,790
we can walk faster to get to He County.

534
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:31,510
Yes.

535
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:32,920
Very close.

536
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:34,330
Let's go.

537
00:24:34,350 --> 00:24:34,790
Go.

538
00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:47,180
There's no honey in his baskets.

539
00:24:47,550 --> 00:24:49,130
I've smelled the aroma of wine.

540
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:51,250
Didn't you say it was close?

541
00:24:51,830 --> 00:24:52,920
Why haven't we arrived yet?

542
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:54,620
We're in a hurry to return to He County.

543
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:55,950
Forget it.

544
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:57,230
We won't buy the honey.

545
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:06,760
Go in.

546
00:25:07,010 --> 00:25:07,640
Go in.

547
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:08,410
Hurry up.

548
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:12,010
I'm so happy

549
00:25:12,330 --> 00:25:13,090
to catch two girls at once.

550
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:13,840
Yes.

551
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:15,340
Let's go.

552
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:16,300
Let's have a drink with elder brother.

553
00:25:16,330 --> 00:25:17,040
Help!

554
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:18,620
Let us out!

555
00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:29,680
Where is Lady Dugu?

556
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:32,350
Where is Juren Dugu's wife,

557
00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:33,590
Qinghong?

558
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:46,210
Drink, brother.

559
00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:48,380
You seem unhappy, brother.

560
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:49,740
I'll get two beauties to drink with you.

561
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:53,980
I want the two newly caught girls.

562
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:56,220
Don't worry. I can see that.

563
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:58,340
You have a good taste.

564
00:25:58,430 --> 00:25:59,170
Come on. Cheers.

565
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:13,700
Come out.

566
00:26:13,830 --> 00:26:14,350
Let's go.

567
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:16,620
Let's go.

568
00:26:19,690 --> 00:26:20,790
Why is there a man?

569
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:21,740
Brat.

570
00:26:21,770 --> 00:26:22,730
How dare you!

571
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:29,700
Help!

572
00:26:29,970 --> 00:26:31,830
A man is taking those girls away.

573
00:26:32,570 --> 00:26:33,870
-Help! -Get your weapons!

574
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:34,610
Let’s go.

575
00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:35,330
Hurry up.

576
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:49,040
Master.

577
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:50,560
Give me a weapon to kill the bandits!

578
00:26:51,010 --> 00:26:51,930
Protect your lady.

579
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:53,760
I'll teach you how to use the spear.

580
00:27:36,430 --> 00:27:37,780
Please spare my life. Please!

581
00:27:45,110 --> 00:27:47,760
[Nanzhou Prison]

582
00:28:03,370 --> 00:28:03,770
You've come.

583
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:05,960
How is the interrogation going?

584
00:28:06,830 --> 00:28:08,150
The leader who used the axe

585
00:28:08,350 --> 00:28:09,380
was once a rebel general.

586
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:10,630
When the court put down the rebellion,

587
00:28:10,710 --> 00:28:11,670
he was lucky to escape.

588
00:28:12,030 --> 00:28:12,630
He has been here for many years,

589
00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:14,220
occupying the mountains

590
00:28:14,370 --> 00:28:15,720
between Nanzhou and He County.

591
00:28:16,030 --> 00:28:17,300
He County is in charge of that place.

592
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:18,400
The sheriff didn't do a stroke of work

593
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:19,600
and the magistrate did nothing.

594
00:28:20,310 --> 00:28:21,570
That's the reason why these bandits

595
00:28:21,930 --> 00:28:22,890
are so rampant.

596
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:25,860
But they didn't kidnap

597
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:28,110
Dugu Xiashu's wife.

598
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:29,790
Yes.

599
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:31,900
Maybe that Juren Dugu

600
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:34,060
lied from the beginning.

601
00:28:55,790 --> 00:28:56,430
Minister Lu

602
00:28:57,490 --> 00:28:58,010
How is it?

603
00:28:58,590 --> 00:28:59,970
He is either buying books or drinking.

604
00:29:00,530 --> 00:29:02,590
His life is so boring.

605
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:04,510
When does he usually stop drinking?

606
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:06,730
I think it will take another two hours.

607
00:29:07,210 --> 00:29:08,250
I really wait to pour that pot of wine

608
00:29:08,290 --> 00:29:09,490
into his stomach.

609
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:10,770
I'm worried for him.

610
00:30:15,470 --> 00:30:15,930
Who?

611
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:20,590
You broke into aother's house late at night.

612
00:30:21,170 --> 00:30:22,430
How dare you ask me who I am?

613
00:30:38,230 --> 00:30:39,200
You want to leave?

614
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:40,470
Can you?

615
00:30:56,420 --> 00:30:57,830
I am the Minister of Justice of this city.

616
00:30:58,240 --> 00:30:59,690
How dare you fight against me?

617
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:01,660
If you don't surrender now,

618
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:04,400
I'll cut off your head immediately after arresting you.

619
00:31:08,370 --> 00:31:09,870
My lord, please listen to me.

620
00:31:11,290 --> 00:31:11,730
Go ahead.

621
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:06,580
Lu Lingfeng.

622
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:08,720
Although you are just scratched

623
00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:09,780
by the hidden weapon,

624
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:12,380
the thief has smeared poison on it.

625
00:32:12,970 --> 00:32:14,470
If I didn't apply it to you

626
00:32:14,710 --> 00:32:16,380
with herbs

627
00:32:16,410 --> 00:32:17,300
that could counteract it.

628
00:32:17,690 --> 00:32:19,780
You're already dead.

629
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:21,550
Really?

630
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:23,290
Fed.

631
00:32:24,740 --> 00:32:25,730
Do you want me

632
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:27,470
to owe you something?

633
00:32:27,690 --> 00:32:28,070
Well...

634
00:32:28,550 --> 00:32:29,210
If you don't believe me,

635
00:32:29,330 --> 00:32:30,610
y-you can ask Xue Huan.

636
00:32:31,010 --> 00:32:32,020
Yes, Master.

637
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:32,910
When Headman Huang and I

638
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:33,860
found you,

639
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:35,990
a large part of your neck was black.

640
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:36,700
Listen!

641
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:38,430
And there was a strange smell.

642
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:39,140
Listen!

643
00:32:39,340 --> 00:32:40,290
Chicken Fed said

644
00:32:40,730 --> 00:32:41,850
if we were one hour late,

645
00:32:42,010 --> 00:32:42,950
you would have died.

646
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:44,300
Listen.

647
00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:50,670
It is just a frightening saying.

648
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:51,720
This...

649
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:54,970
Tell me.

650
00:32:56,010 --> 00:32:56,790
I've already owed you

651
00:32:56,820 --> 00:32:58,060
chickens for your whole life.

652
00:32:58,490 --> 00:33:00,410
You still rack your brain like this.

653
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:03,230
What else do you want?

654
00:33:04,370 --> 00:33:04,880
Well...

655
00:33:07,230 --> 00:33:08,290
You're right.

656
00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:10,220
So,

657
00:33:10,750 --> 00:33:12,450
even if you saved me again,

658
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:14,330
I wouldn't thank you anymore.

659
00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:16,000
You are just afraid that after I die,

660
00:33:16,180 --> 00:33:17,660
no one will offer you chicken to eat.

661
00:33:17,770 --> 00:33:18,930
You...

662
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:22,230
Remember.

663
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:25,020
This time, you are in more danger than

664
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:26,320
the time you were shot in Chang'an.

665
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:28,660
This man is skilled in using poison.

666
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:30,260
You must be careful.

667
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:34,660
Got it.

668
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:36,280
Got it.

669
00:33:37,420 --> 00:33:38,180
I'm thirsty.

670
00:33:38,530 --> 00:33:39,360
Pour some water.

671
00:33:41,180 --> 00:33:42,500
Is Lu Lingfeng awake?

672
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:46,210
T-T-This...

673
00:33:47,290 --> 00:33:47,830
Why...

674
00:33:48,130 --> 00:33:49,620
Why do you come in without knocking?

675
00:33:50,850 --> 00:33:51,580
Stop covering.

676
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:53,520
When I treated you before,

677
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:55,120
it was Miss Xijun

678
00:33:55,140 --> 00:33:56,260
who took your clothes off.

679
00:33:58,870 --> 00:33:59,740
What?

680
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:03,420
Master.

681
00:34:04,020 --> 00:34:04,990
you've been unconscious

682
00:34:05,020 --> 00:34:05,950
for twenty hours.

683
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:08,250
My lady

684
00:34:08,290 --> 00:34:09,409
had been by your side all the time.

685
00:34:09,570 --> 00:34:10,969
I thought she was too sleepy,

686
00:34:11,130 --> 00:34:11,830
so I came here

687
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:13,130
to let her rest

688
00:34:13,170 --> 00:34:13,760
for a while.

689
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:15,070
How dare you!

690
00:34:17,770 --> 00:34:18,810
You are my disciple.

691
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:20,659
You don't take care of me,

692
00:34:20,980 --> 00:34:22,550
how can you let your lady work so hard?

693
00:34:24,110 --> 00:34:25,480
Have you noticed that

694
00:34:25,969 --> 00:34:27,840
after General arrived in Nanzhou,

695
00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:29,150
he became a lot more interesting?

696
00:34:30,770 --> 00:34:31,770
What do you mean?

697
00:34:32,489 --> 00:34:33,500
I just

698
00:34:34,050 --> 00:34:35,280
find happiness in suffering.

699
00:34:35,929 --> 00:34:37,480
I even said I cared about the whole country.

700
00:34:38,020 --> 00:34:38,980
But I

701
00:34:39,590 --> 00:34:42,179
almost died here.

702
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:44,060
Xue Huan taught me a lesson before.

703
00:34:44,060 --> 00:34:44,770
He did it well.

704
00:34:45,139 --> 00:34:47,540
I can't even

705
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:49,330
do a good job as Nanzhou's acting Minister of Justice.

706
00:34:50,620 --> 00:34:52,380
How can I say I cared about the country?

707
00:34:53,139 --> 00:34:56,219
It's really gratifying

708
00:34:56,650 --> 00:34:58,380
to hear you say so.

709
00:34:59,830 --> 00:35:00,960
Don't laugh at me.

710
00:35:01,730 --> 00:35:02,530
Laugh at you?

711
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:05,140
I'm here to visit you

712
00:35:05,180 --> 00:35:07,180
by the order of the prefectural governor.

713
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:08,600
Don't worry.

714
00:35:08,830 --> 00:35:10,510
He won't die with me here.

715
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:12,180
You can tell the prefectural governor

716
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:14,050
it is me who save his life.

717
00:35:14,340 --> 00:35:15,660
He can treat me

718
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:17,000
at Gourmet Restaurant

719
00:35:17,410 --> 00:35:18,640
to thank me.

720
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:21,950
Don't bother the prefectural governor for such a trivial matter.

721
00:35:22,490 --> 00:35:24,860
I can afford it with my salary.

722
00:35:25,030 --> 00:35:26,190
You usually are penny-pinching.

723
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:27,960
Why are you so generous today?

724
00:35:28,610 --> 00:35:29,490
I'm hungry too.

725
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:31,270
Can you bring me back

726
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:33,480
a bowl of soup?

727
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:36,260
It's good to be hungry.

728
00:35:36,550 --> 00:35:37,380
No chicken soup.

729
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:38,310
It's too greasy.

730
00:35:38,780 --> 00:35:39,940
Rice soup is the best.

731
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:41,010
I'll cook it.

732
00:35:42,470 --> 00:35:44,180
Wait, I haven't finished yet.

733
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:45,880
Rice soup is not enough.

734
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:47,020
Okay, I'll listen to you.

735
00:35:47,350 --> 00:35:48,360
What happened?

736
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:37,270
Ji Xiang?

737
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:43,970
Where is Ji Xiang?

738
00:37:56,650 --> 00:37:57,310
Ji Xiang.

739
00:38:27,220 --> 00:38:28,820
It's raining outside

740
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:30,720
I thought you wouldn't go out.

741
00:38:31,690 --> 00:38:32,340
Commander Su.

742
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:33,590
You're here.

743
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:36,440
Greetings, Commander Su.

744
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:42,870
The mountain behind is full of plants.

745
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:44,440
There are always pheasants.

746
00:38:45,130 --> 00:38:46,370
They can't fly far in rainy days.

747
00:38:46,860 --> 00:38:47,990
I happen to be free today,

748
00:38:48,260 --> 00:38:49,540
so I have gone hunting.

749
00:38:50,510 --> 00:38:51,270
Unfortunately,

750
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:52,390
I can't cook it for

751
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:53,580
those two scholars.

752
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:56,910
Would you like some tea?

753
00:38:57,490 --> 00:38:58,540
I'm really thirsty.

754
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:04,610
Commander Su, please.

755
00:39:10,250 --> 00:39:11,320
My tea is of poor quality.

756
00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:13,050
Commander Su, don't laugh at me.

757
00:39:15,310 --> 00:39:16,820
People in the Central Plains seldom drink tea.

758
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:19,360
For me,

759
00:39:19,820 --> 00:39:20,900
it's tasty.

760
00:39:24,940 --> 00:39:26,050
You also love reading?

761
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:29,350
Many books here

762
00:39:29,370 --> 00:39:30,130
belong to those two scholars.

763
00:39:30,590 --> 00:39:31,790
Sometimes when I'm free,

764
00:39:31,820 --> 00:39:32,670
I'd like to read books

765
00:39:32,820 --> 00:39:33,500
to kill time.

766
00:39:35,060 --> 00:39:36,390
This is a good habit.

767
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:38,070
I admire people

768
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:39,860
who love reading bookes.

769
00:39:40,830 --> 00:39:41,820
Thank you, Commander.

770
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:44,450
I'm just influenced by them.

771
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:46,490
Without these two scholars

772
00:39:46,610 --> 00:39:47,620
studying hard for the exam here

773
00:39:48,220 --> 00:39:49,120
how would I have the chance

774
00:39:49,150 --> 00:39:50,110
to read these books?

775
00:39:51,450 --> 00:39:52,130
May I

776
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:53,800
ask

777
00:39:55,940 --> 00:39:57,420
if the murderer who killed Juren Liu

778
00:39:58,600 --> 00:39:59,350
has been caught?

779
00:40:02,890 --> 00:40:03,550
Not yet.

780
00:40:04,270 --> 00:40:07,740
That is why I'm here.

781
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:09,360
How heavy the rain is!

782
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,810
It really makes people feel dizzy.

783
00:40:13,050 --> 00:40:14,540
I'm here to ask you

784
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:16,870
if you have any clues.

785
00:40:16,890 --> 00:40:19,770
Something you forgot to tell me last time.

786
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:21,680
Well...

787
00:40:21,940 --> 00:40:23,670
I saw you hesitated

788
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:25,510
last time.

789
00:40:26,380 --> 00:40:26,850
No.

790
00:40:27,570 --> 00:40:29,280
There should be no other clues.

791
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:30,350
I've already told you.

792
00:40:30,740 --> 00:40:31,450
Ji Xiang.

793
00:40:32,150 --> 00:40:34,270
The murder is a serious case.

794
00:40:34,580 --> 00:40:36,530
You should tell me the truth.

795
00:40:37,990 --> 00:40:39,320
I'm indebted to both of them.

796
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:42,740
If I speak ill of them on the sly,

797
00:40:43,010 --> 00:40:43,820
then

798
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:46,380
I have received their help in vain.

799
00:40:46,420 --> 00:40:48,110
Solving the case as soon as possible

800
00:40:48,140 --> 00:40:50,650
is the greatest consolation to the deceased.

801
00:40:51,690 --> 00:40:52,250
Fine.

802
00:40:53,890 --> 00:40:54,950
I'll tell you everything then.

803
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:56,430
Go ahead.

804
00:40:56,680 --> 00:40:57,240
Actually,

805
00:40:57,290 --> 00:40:58,700
Dugu Xiashu once said

806
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:00,880
he wanted to kill Liu Youqiu.

807
00:41:05,260 --> 00:41:06,480
When did this happen?

808
00:41:07,270 --> 00:41:08,630
It should be ten days ago.

809
00:41:09,620 --> 00:41:10,620
Dong Lang heard it too.

810
00:41:12,150 --> 00:41:13,070
Why would you do this?

811
00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:13,770
Tell me.

812
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:14,850
Why?

813
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:16,300
Liu Youqiu,

814
00:41:16,690 --> 00:41:18,570
you have to make it clear today.

815
00:41:18,670 --> 00:41:19,550
What do you want?

816
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:21,680
Tell me.

817
00:41:22,570 --> 00:41:23,080
Dong Lang.

818
00:41:23,780 --> 00:41:24,620
What are you doing?

819
00:41:26,090 --> 00:41:27,140
Tell me!

820
00:41:28,270 --> 00:41:29,890
Tell me, Liu Youqiu!

821
00:41:30,090 --> 00:41:30,660
Are you crazy?

822
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:31,060
Yes.

823
00:41:31,540 --> 00:41:32,330
I'm crazy.

824
00:41:32,620 --> 00:41:34,020
That's because you forced me.

825
00:41:34,870 --> 00:41:36,140
Liu Youqiu, I...

826
00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:38,050
I will kill you.

827
00:41:40,270 --> 00:41:41,500
Come on, kill me.

828
00:41:42,130 --> 00:41:42,960
Do it now.

829
00:41:43,220 --> 00:41:44,750
It's better to be killed by you

830
00:41:44,770 --> 00:41:46,000
than be beaten to death by my father.

831
00:41:47,810 --> 00:41:48,420
Come on.

832
00:41:48,980 --> 00:41:49,680
Take it.

833
00:41:50,180 --> 00:41:50,720
Come on.

834
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:53,240
What?

835
00:41:53,910 --> 00:41:54,490
You don't kill me?

836
00:41:57,310 --> 00:41:58,310
I thought you were really

837
00:41:58,340 --> 00:41:59,270
going to kill me.

838
00:42:00,260 --> 00:42:01,270
I can't

839
00:42:06,490 --> 00:42:07,330
do that to you anyway.

840
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:22,060
Do you know the reason?

841
00:42:22,710 --> 00:42:23,490
It seemed that

842
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:25,360
Juren Dugu

843
00:42:26,190 --> 00:42:28,240
suspected that Liu Youqiu seduced his wife.

844
00:42:30,730 --> 00:42:33,350
Did Qinghong come here often?

845
00:42:34,660 --> 00:42:36,910
She came here about every ten days.

846
00:42:36,940 --> 00:42:38,760
Is there any evidence

847
00:42:39,020 --> 00:42:40,010
for Dugu Xiashu's suspicion?

848
00:42:41,860 --> 00:42:43,060
It seemed that

849
00:42:44,110 --> 00:42:45,430
once Qinghong came,

850
00:42:45,620 --> 00:42:46,270
it happened that

851
00:42:46,430 --> 00:42:47,580
her husband was away.

852
00:42:48,410 --> 00:42:49,370
Liu Youqiu...

853
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:53,290
I didn't see

854
00:42:53,860 --> 00:42:54,670
what happened exactly.

855
00:42:55,710 --> 00:42:56,770
I wouldn't dare to make irresponsible remarks.

856
00:43:11,940 --> 00:43:16,040
♫The storm rises with no reason♫

857

♫Carving right and wrong into a clear heart♫

869
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:17,740
♫The truth♫

870
00:44:18,290 --> 00:44:21,360
♫Will reinterpret this justice♫

871
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:27,520
♫Even if there is fog♫

872
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:30,510
♫Even if there are invisible waves♫

873
00:44:32,120 --> 00:44:34,110
♫I'll tell the story of the fate♫

874
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:40,630
♫Tell the love of the world♫

875
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:44,120
♫For the memory of grace♫

876
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:47,420
♫And the resentment is not yet over♫

877
00:44:48,410 --> 00:44:53,840
♫The rivers and mountains are immortal, the clouds are overturned♫

878
00:44:54,780 --> 00:45:00,980
♫To be consoled by the truth, even with thorns on my back♫

879
00:45:01,300 --> 00:45:05,700
♫Only for justice♫

880
00:45:07,670 --> 00:45:13,950
♫That I seek a truth for this long, lonely night♫

881
00:45:14,230 --> 00:45:20,120
♫The heaven and earth are held together by a strong will♫

882
00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:23,210
♫The people are in peace♫

883
00:45:23,240 --> 00:45:27,670
♫Carving right and wrong into a clear heart♫

884
00:45:28,390 --> 00:45:29,760
♫The truth♫

885
00:45:29,790 --> 00:45:33,520
♫Will reinterpret this justice♫

886
00:45:33,770 --> 00:45:39,880
♫Even if there are a thousand sails, it's not a waste of time♫

887
00:45:40,250 --> 00:45:46,430
♫What I am afraid of is the unrighted wrong♫

888
00:45:47,050 --> 00:45:48,960
♫What is the meaning of life and death?♫

889
00:45:49,180 --> 00:45:53,320
♫I'll paint the sunshine into the landscape♫

890
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:55,360
♫The spirit of righteousness♫

891
00:45:55,560 --> 00:45:58,970
♫Exists for the one I care♫
