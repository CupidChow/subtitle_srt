4
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:48,580
Was that monster in human shape?

5
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:52,400
No.

6
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:54,440
It got a head that was like a boar's.

7
00:01:54,979 --> 00:01:56,490
Then why didn't you call it a boar?

8
00:01:56,539 --> 00:01:57,020
It was…

9
00:01:57,940 --> 00:01:58,930
thin.

10
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:00,220
It was thin.

11
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:02,150
It was much thinner than a boar.

12
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:03,720
And its legs were longer.

13
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:09,930
It could stand up?

14
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:11,830
Yes!

15
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:14,240
It could climb trees too?

16
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:15,890
Yes!

17
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,520
Then it must be a wild man.

18
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:18,710
How dare you, Liu Shiba!

19
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:19,579
How dare you eat a human!

20
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:24,820
I...

21
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:29,740
You have the face of a good man.

22
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:31,380
I don't think you dare eat human flesh.

23
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:34,510
Yes!

24
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:35,970
Yes.

25
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,560
Bring me to see

26
00:02:38,579 --> 00:02:39,780
your trap tomorrow morning.

27
00:02:40,329 --> 00:02:41,329
I want to see

28
00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:42,650
the monster you mentioned.

29
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:45,610
Sure, sure!

30
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:53,800
Someone's coming.

31
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:57,250
It can't be.

32
00:02:57,940 --> 00:02:58,980
It is already incredible

33
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:00,470
to have a general like you

34
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:01,660
in this deserted stage station.

35
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:03,540
How come there are other people coming?

36
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:06,510
But why did I hear

37
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:07,620
knocking?

38
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:11,120
Did you?

39
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:12,320
Yes!

40
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:14,970
It must be a passer-by who is trapped in the rain.

41
00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:16,390
It's fate that we meet in the same inn.

42
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:17,640
Just take him in.

43
00:03:18,579 --> 00:03:19,470
I'll pay for both of us.

44
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:21,770
Okay!

45
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:31,400
Ma Butong from Lingyun Temple in Nanzhou,

46
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:32,380
wishes to lodge in.

47
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,320
This stage station has been abandoned.

48
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:36,140
There is a new one ten miles away.

49
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:37,430
You can sleep there.

50
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:38,290
Wait.

51
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:40,410
To be honest,

52
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,920
the painting in my arms

53
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:44,710
is the famous painter in Chang'an,

54
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:46,310
Zhang Xuan's masterpiece,

55
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:47,310
the painting of the Stone Bridge.

56
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:49,990
This painting is priceless.

57
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:51,120
If it is watered by the rain,

58
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:53,030
I can't justify myself to Her Highness.

59
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:54,210
My head

60
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,060
is nothing compared to a little corner of this painting.

61
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:57,980
Please take me in.

62
00:03:58,130 --> 00:03:59,250
You will be my lifesaver.

63
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:03,480
But this station is not clean.

64
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:04,300
It's okay.

65
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:05,780
I can clean it myself.

66
00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:08,010
That's not what I meant.

67
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:10,160
Could it be...

68
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:11,470
haunted?

69
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:13,100
Yes.

70
00:04:13,130 --> 00:04:14,380
Then I am more fearless.

71
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:15,590
In the temple,

72
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,450
I majored in subduing demons and ghosts.

73
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:20,320
I can help you get rid of evil spirits in the station,

74
00:04:20,339 --> 00:04:21,640
and I won't charge you, okay?

75
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:24,820
Since you insist,

76
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:26,050
you can stay.

77
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:29,550
But a general came here before you,

78
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:30,840
and he has a weird temper.

79
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:32,760
You must be careful around him.

80
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:33,970
I understand.

81
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:35,110
Understand.

82
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,420
Ma Butong from Lingyun Temple.

83
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:46,960
Greetings, General.

84
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:49,620
Ma Butong?

85
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,480
A Taoist priest!

86
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,730
I take back what I said.

87
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:59,230
What does the general mean?

88
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:02,360
Nothing.

89
00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:05,680
Would you like something to eat?

90
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:08,570
I don't eat after noon.

91
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:11,320
I'm not like some useless people whose minds are only on foods and drinks.

92
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:13,390
Who's useless?

93
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:17,410
I'm tired.

94
00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:19,660
Is the right superior room empty?

95
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:20,870
I'm going to bed.

96
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:24,420
Stop!

97
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:26,420
How dare you!

98
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:27,700
I'm here.

99
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:29,310
How dare you sleep in the right superior room?

100
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:34,150
I'm on a mission to bring this painting

101
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:35,880
to Her Highness in Chang'an.

102
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:38,110
Who are you to fight over that room with me?

103
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:38,920
Her Highness?

104
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:40,230
I've been ordered to go north

105
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:42,220
to guard the border by His Majesty.

106
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:43,900
You can't scare me with a princess.

107
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:46,370
There are many soldiers guarding the border.

108
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,220
Can you reach the emperor?

109
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:49,560
Can you reach the princess?

110
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:50,460
Of course, I can.

111
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:54,600
I can subdue demons and ghosts.

112
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:56,270
Her Highness has promised me

113
00:05:56,370 --> 00:05:58,050
to give me a high-ranking position.

114
00:05:58,159 --> 00:05:59,720
If someone like you can be an official,

115
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:01,380
the court will be doomed.

116
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:01,980
Liu Shiba.

117
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:03,100
Yes.

118
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,600
Didn't you say this stage station

119
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:05,330
is not clean?

120
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:07,460
After I spill this priest's blood here,

121
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,330
your station

122
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:10,370
will be clean ever after.

123
00:06:14,130 --> 00:06:15,070
Don't kill him, don't.

124
00:06:15,170 --> 00:06:16,300
I-I'm scared.

125
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:17,880
You priest!

126
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:19,800
How dare you talk back to the general?

127
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:23,100
Fine, fine.

128
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:24,710
You win!

129
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:27,270
Can I stay in the left superior room?

130
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:30,420
You're just a priest.

131
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:31,660
You shouldn't stay in an official stage station.

132
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:34,010
How dare you sleep in a room the same level as mine?

133
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:37,360
Liu Shiba.

134
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:38,280
Yes.

135
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:39,620
Find a stockroom or a wing-room

136
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:40,409
for him.

137
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:42,350
Throw him out once the rain stops.

138
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:43,460
Yes, yes!

139
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:44,000
You, you...

140
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:45,010
Let's go, go.

141
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:54,550
You'll suffer losses

142
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:55,800
in front of a military man like him

143
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:57,310
with those snappy comebacks.

144
00:06:59,090 --> 00:06:59,920
Tell me!

145
00:07:00,130 --> 00:07:01,170
What is his name!

146
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,760
I'll go and tell

147
00:07:02,850 --> 00:07:03,750
Her Highness.

148
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:04,800
Okay, okay.

149
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:06,380
I'll ask around for you.

150
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,880
I'll take you to the first wing-room on the right.

151
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:10,500
That room is very spacious.

152
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:11,680
It's not worse than the superior room.

153
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:13,820
Later, I'll bring some good wine

154
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,080
to warm you up.

155
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:16,180
Don't be angry.

156
00:07:17,730 --> 00:07:19,550
You're a smart corvee.

157
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:23,460
If I become an official someday,

158
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:24,970
I won't forget you.

159
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:42,370
General.

160
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:43,710
Rest early.

161
00:07:45,010 --> 00:07:45,570
Wait.

162
00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:48,620
I'm tired from the trip.

163
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:50,070
Bring me a bucket of hot water

164
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:51,350
for my feet.

165
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:52,370
Okay.

166
00:08:04,810 --> 00:08:05,950
You bring me wine too.

167
00:08:11,850 --> 00:08:14,570
Can you join me for a drink?

168
00:08:15,610 --> 00:08:16,460
I can't.

169
00:08:16,850 --> 00:08:18,380
That general needs hot water to wash his feet

170
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:19,820
and asks me to serve him.

171
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:22,430
He is so domineering.

172
00:08:22,890 --> 00:08:25,280
It's better to let him meet an evil spirit tonight.

173
00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:47,460
General, it's all done.

174
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:50,700
OK. You can leave now.

175
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:55,600
Cover me with my quilt.

176
00:08:57,730 --> 00:08:58,340
Okay.

177
00:09:02,770 --> 00:09:04,060
Blow out the light too.

178
00:10:57,010 --> 00:10:58,190
Yes.

179
00:10:58,700 --> 00:10:59,860
After what happened to our second brother,

180
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:00,850
we agreed

181
00:11:01,210 --> 00:11:03,190
to only let one person enter the station every day.

182
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:04,700
But this priest,

183
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:06,340
later here,

184
00:11:07,090 --> 00:11:08,660
has a very expensive painting

185
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:10,260
in his hand.

186
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,760
We've made it.

187
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:14,630
As long as we take that painting

188
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:15,730
and sell it in Chang'an,

189
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:17,100
we don't have to

190
00:11:17,130 --> 00:11:18,190
live like this anymore.

191
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:20,510
This one is rich.

192
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:23,120
Let's check if his wallet is full of gold or silver.

193
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:40,570
Stop, you bandit!

194
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,680
Su Wuming!

195
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:43,790
Su Wuming.

196
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:45,670
Stop yelling.

197
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:47,290
I'm not dead.

198
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:49,550
Don't you see I'm sleeping?

199
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:51,020
You didn't take

200
00:13:51,050 --> 00:13:51,850
the medicine that Fed gave you?

201
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:54,060
Yes.

202
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,230
Then why did you sleep so soundly?

203
00:13:58,190 --> 00:13:59,240
You look at him.

204
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:00,830
He looks like a demon. How scary!

205
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,700
If I hadn't pretended to be asleep,

206
00:14:03,090 --> 00:14:04,140
he would have killed me.

207
00:14:07,330 --> 00:14:08,410
Look at him yourself.

208
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:09,320
Besides,

209
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:10,910
I'm just a scholar.

210
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:12,020
Even if I'd got up,

211
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:13,130
I would've only distracted you.

212
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,760
We worked out fine.

213
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:16,130
Not at all!

214
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,340
One ran away just now.

215
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,830
What's the big deal?

216
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:21,170
We still caught one here.

217
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:23,410
It's good to have one for us to interrogate.

218
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:26,000
Help me up!

219
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:33,680
I'm the new Military Commander of Nanzhou,

220
00:14:33,710 --> 00:14:34,540
Su Wuming.

221
00:14:35,310 --> 00:14:36,390
What's your name?

222
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:08,680
Liar! Liar!

223
00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:36,190
How is it?

224
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:37,660
Just as you expected.

225
00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:39,050
Xue Huan,

226
00:15:39,410 --> 00:15:40,660
get ready to fight the bandits with me.

227
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:41,440
Yes, sir.

228
00:16:07,810 --> 00:16:08,860
Sheriff Su,

229
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:10,930
how have you been?

230
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:15,340
You are...

231
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:16,380
What?

232
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:18,200
Don't you recognize me?

233
00:16:18,690 --> 00:16:20,210
We share the same surname.

234
00:16:20,530 --> 00:16:22,560
I just shaved my beard,

235
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:24,280
and you can't recognize me?

236
00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:27,370
Su Wuming?

237
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:30,810
It is me.

238
00:16:31,570 --> 00:16:33,060
Since you have assumed your office in Nanzhou,

239
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,400
why are you back?

240
00:16:35,850 --> 00:16:37,900
I always feel

241
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:38,990
that this Gantang Post is shady.

242
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:40,680
So I came back to investigate.

243
00:16:41,130 --> 00:16:42,680
Why? Can't I?

244
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:44,580
Of course you can.

245
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:46,420
But...

246
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:49,450
This is my jurisdiction.

247
00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:50,610
I know.

248
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:52,320
So I want to ask

249
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:54,820
how you

250
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:55,930
punished that Liu Shiba.

251
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,450
He is being held in the Gantang Post under arrest.

252
00:16:57,900 --> 00:16:59,130
Did he confess

253
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,030
how many people he killed these years?

254
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:04,190
We have his testimony. It's none of your business.

255
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:08,050
Those people who were killed

256
00:17:08,650 --> 00:17:11,480
should all be like that Colonel Yu.

257
00:17:12,290 --> 00:17:15,300
Someone like them would always bring

258
00:17:15,609 --> 00:17:16,800
a lot of money with them when traveling.

259
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:18,329
Where did their money go?

260
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:21,460
There was nothing.

261
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:24,130
The reason Commander Su returned to the Gantang Post

262
00:17:24,770 --> 00:17:26,530
is just

263
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:28,750
for those gold and silver that don't exist?

264
00:17:29,810 --> 00:17:31,750
Don't exist?

265
00:17:32,810 --> 00:17:35,280
The Cui family of Qinghe has a piece of precious jade as their heirloom.

266
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,110
Cui Wuji who was killed by him

267
00:17:37,410 --> 00:17:38,580
must have it on him.

268
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:42,390
Where is Liu Shiqi?

269
00:17:46,770 --> 00:17:47,890
Why didn't I see

270
00:17:48,770 --> 00:17:49,750
that jade they mentioned?

271
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:53,540
Sheriff Su,

272
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:55,790
I didn't know it was valuable,

273
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:56,810
so I didn't bring it to you.

274
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,110
Hurry

275
00:17:58,140 --> 00:17:58,780
and kill those people.

276
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:00,560
We brothers can continue to serve you.

277
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:01,440
Shut up!

278
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:05,870
You are Liu Shiqi?

279
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:08,900
Then the monster in that room

280
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,780
should be Liu Shijiu.

281
00:18:12,930 --> 00:18:15,130
I've been in Gantang County for days.

282
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:17,190
I also heard something.

283
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:19,050
Liu Shiba's father

284
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:21,550
was the headman of Sheriff Su.

285
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:24,230
He died in the Gantang Post three years ago.

286
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:25,910
The cause of his death is unknown.

287
00:18:29,670 --> 00:18:30,510
Su Wuming.

288
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:32,980
You want to intervene in this case?

289
00:18:34,010 --> 00:18:35,020
Can't I?

290
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:36,300
It's not your turn.

291
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:37,740
This case is weird.

292
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:39,380
This Su is even weirder.

293
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:40,840
His identity of military commander

294
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,490
must be made up.

295
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,830
Arrest all three of them.

296
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:45,670
Yes.

297
00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:46,520
Wait.

298
00:18:50,990 --> 00:18:52,800
In our Su family,

299
00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:54,840
we actually have a rascal like you.

300
00:18:55,810 --> 00:18:56,410
Tell me.

301
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:58,950
How much dirty money

302
00:18:58,970 --> 00:19:01,040
did you make

303
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:03,010
with the three Liu brothers?

304
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:04,750
What are you waiting for?

305
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:06,860
I don't want to hear him talk anymore!

306
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:08,880
Kill them on the spot!

307
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:53,380
Magistrate!

308
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:54,860
What brought you here?

309
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:55,470
Hurry.

310
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:56,360
Take these people...

311
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:56,760
Shut up!

312
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:06,700
Commander Su,

313
00:20:07,410 --> 00:20:08,810
if you hadn't returned to the Gantang Post,

314
00:20:09,190 --> 00:20:09,820
I wouldn't have known

315
00:20:09,850 --> 00:20:10,800
his real face.

316
00:20:18,770 --> 00:20:19,910
Though this case falls in my jurisdiction,

317
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:23,080
I'd like you to hear it.

318
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:25,520
Thank you, Wang.

319
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:27,340
Please.

320
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:35,920
I believe your story

321
00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:38,070
starts from your childhood.

322
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:40,620
Who wants to say it?

323
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:45,450
Me.

324
00:20:48,970 --> 00:20:50,480
25 years ago,

325
00:20:51,970 --> 00:20:53,780
my mother gave birth to the three of us.

326
00:20:56,270 --> 00:20:58,110
They thought there were only two boys.

327
00:20:59,030 --> 00:21:00,310
But later they found

328
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,480
there was one left.

329
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,570
My mother had fainted

330
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,690
several times from the pain.

331
00:21:10,130 --> 00:21:12,570
But she realized there was still a baby in her.

332
00:21:13,150 --> 00:21:16,330
So she asked the midwife to do her best to deliver the baby.

333
00:21:17,130 --> 00:21:17,740
In the end,

334
00:21:18,730 --> 00:21:20,050
he survived,

335
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:22,770
but my mother died.

336
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:29,050
He was born strange.

337
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:31,650
He couldn't talk even when he was five

338
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:34,180
or walk.

339
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:38,200
He crawled on the ground every day.

340
00:21:39,150 --> 00:21:39,870
I don't know

341
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:42,070
who told my father

342
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:43,800
that he was a monster.

343
00:21:44,190 --> 00:21:45,750
So he threw him away.

344
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:50,820
There were only two

345
00:21:52,150 --> 00:21:53,130
left in the house.

346
00:21:53,170 --> 00:21:54,180
Even two are too much!

347
00:21:55,990 --> 00:21:57,980
It would've been much better

348
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,140
if he'd thrown you away too.

349
00:22:00,310 --> 00:22:01,350
After that,

350
00:22:01,810 --> 00:22:03,750
your old neighbors

351
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:05,000
told me some.

352
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:07,300
Liu Shiqi,

353
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:10,160
You've been a rogue since childhood.

354
00:22:10,550 --> 00:22:11,360
A liar.

355
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:12,620
After you grew up,

356
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:14,880
you started to steal.

357
00:22:15,410 --> 00:22:17,770
Your father worked in the county government.

358
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:20,030
Because of your theft,

359
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:22,720
he was constantly humiliated by others.

360
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,660
When you were 13,

361
00:22:25,690 --> 00:22:26,910
he finally couldn't tolerate your behavior

362
00:22:27,330 --> 00:22:29,450
and kicked you out of Gantang County.

363
00:22:30,710 --> 00:22:31,480
That was because

364
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:33,010
I sold a few girls.

365
00:22:33,610 --> 00:22:35,100
He was afraid if he didn't kick me out,

366
00:22:35,150 --> 00:22:36,750
those little girls' parents

367
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:38,140
would come to me and beat me to death.

368
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:40,980
And he would lost his job too.

369
00:22:41,430 --> 00:22:43,220
So that case of the abduction and trafficking of young girls

370
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:44,100
was done by you

371
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:45,490
when you were 13.

372
00:22:45,910 --> 00:22:46,820
Yes！

373
00:22:47,070 --> 00:22:48,920
I have a gift for that!

374
00:22:49,250 --> 00:22:51,020
I impressed you, didn't I?

375
00:22:52,130 --> 00:22:54,100
That case caused a sensation in Gantang back then.

376
00:22:54,190 --> 00:22:55,990
So many families were ruined by you!

377
00:22:57,350 --> 00:22:58,040
Liu Shiba,

378
00:22:58,770 --> 00:23:00,350
do you know about this?

379
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:02,720
Yes.

380
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:04,460
I've been regretting

381
00:23:04,490 --> 00:23:06,550
not reporting him to the government.

382
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:09,780
I'm your brother.

383
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:11,980
Report me?

384
00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:13,680
Are you a monster?

385
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:15,900
You're the monster!

386
00:23:17,210 --> 00:23:19,600
You stole all our savings.

387
00:23:20,430 --> 00:23:21,180
Our father saved that money

388
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:23,130
for me to finish my education.

389
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:24,780
What's the use of education?

390
00:23:25,090 --> 00:23:26,210
With a father like that,

391
00:23:26,390 --> 00:23:28,200
you can't change your fate no matter how well-educated you are!

392
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:38,180
Wasn't he your father too?

393
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:39,860
He was a loser.

394
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:41,380
He didn't deserve to be my father!

395
00:23:42,330 --> 00:23:44,250
He worked in the county government for half his life,

396
00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:45,710
but our life was just as poor

397
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:46,590
as a beggar's!

398
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:48,220
If I were him,

399
00:23:48,430 --> 00:23:49,840
I would've showered my family with riches!

400
00:24:02,290 --> 00:24:02,970
Sheriff Su,

401
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,670
I found this just now.

402
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:06,940
It's the loot Liu Shiqi kept to himself.

403
00:24:07,130 --> 00:24:08,330
He didn't give it to you

404
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:09,260
even though you saved his life.

405
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:15,500
There was an old corvee working in the Gantang Post.

406
00:24:15,530 --> 00:24:17,260
His body hasn't been found yet.

407
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:19,430
He should have lost his life

408
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:20,650
to the serpents too.

409
00:24:26,570 --> 00:24:27,570
Yeah.

410
00:24:29,770 --> 00:24:31,420
I was very disappointed

411
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:33,230
when I just arrived at the Gantang Post.

412
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:35,460
I felt

413
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:37,590
there was no future for me there.

414
00:24:39,790 --> 00:24:41,390
But later I noticed

415
00:24:42,350 --> 00:24:43,350
that there were often

416
00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:46,160
successful people from different places

417
00:24:46,190 --> 00:24:47,680
taking a rest in the post.

418
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:50,240
I learned a lot

419
00:24:51,250 --> 00:24:54,110
from their speeches and behaviors.

420
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:55,620
Some high-ranking officials

421
00:24:56,340 --> 00:24:58,720
would treat me with respect

422
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:00,190
just because I offered them help.

423
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:02,480
I was really content.

424
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,500
But the situation went downhill soon.

425
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:10,240
Strange things happened frequently in the Gantang Post.

426
00:25:10,890 --> 00:25:12,010
The old corvee said

427
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:13,750
that they had only happened

428
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:15,320
since I came there.

429
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:17,890
I had no idea at that time

430
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:20,060
that my brother

431
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:23,240
had been following me.

432
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:27,580
After he was dumped in the woods that year,

433
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:29,330
he didn't die.

434
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:32,630
He grew up

435
00:25:32,650 --> 00:25:33,780
with a nest of serpents.

436
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:37,320
He knew the way home

437
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:39,310
and often sneaked back.

438
00:25:39,810 --> 00:25:42,140
But he was afraid of our father

439
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:45,220
and never made an appearance.

440
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:47,730
After I came to the Gantang Post,

441
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:50,940
the old corvee found

442
00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:54,410
that the chickens in the yard started to go missing.

443
00:25:55,890 --> 00:25:56,950
He thought

444
00:25:57,610 --> 00:25:58,760
it was the weasels.

445
00:26:00,250 --> 00:26:01,620
But he later found out

446
00:26:02,350 --> 00:26:03,570
that it was my brother.

447
00:26:05,050 --> 00:26:06,810
He wanted to kill my brother,

448
00:26:08,010 --> 00:26:09,490
but was attacked by the serpents.

449
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:12,420
That was the first time

450
00:26:13,330 --> 00:26:15,580
I'd seen my long-lost brother.

451
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:17,980
It was also the first time

452
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:19,880
I'd seen him using his fingers

453
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:22,090
to tear off human flesh

454
00:26:22,630 --> 00:26:25,610
bit by bit.

455
00:26:25,990 --> 00:26:27,350
I rushed to stop him,

456
00:26:27,370 --> 00:26:28,040
but he…

457
00:26:35,770 --> 00:26:37,240
He bit off your finger.

458
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:39,080
He didn't mean it!

459
00:26:40,010 --> 00:26:42,710
He regretted it immediately.

460
00:26:43,170 --> 00:26:46,740
His eyes were bleeding.

461
00:26:53,050 --> 00:26:54,530
I didn't dare to report it to the government.

462
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:57,430
I hurried back home to tell my father.

463
00:26:57,770 --> 00:26:59,410
Father sharpened his knife

464
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:01,380
and was determined to kill my monstrous brother himself.

465
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:08,230
But Liu Shiqi killed our father.

466
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:11,080
Liu Shiqi found our brother first

467
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,140
and cajoled him into killing people.

468
00:27:17,690 --> 00:27:20,010
You killed your father?

469
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:21,640
When I was 13,

470
00:27:21,670 --> 00:27:23,200
I was too weak to kill him.

471
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:25,180
Otherwise,

472
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:27,330
that old thing would've long been dead.

473
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:30,450
You beast!

474
00:27:38,550 --> 00:27:40,320
You just took office at that time

475
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:41,320
and was responsible for

476
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:43,220
this Gantang Post case.

477
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:44,400
Am I right, Sheriff Su?

478
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:48,520
I pitied these three brothers

479
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:50,180
so I said those two men

480
00:27:50,350 --> 00:27:51,750
were killed by the serpents.

481
00:27:51,990 --> 00:27:53,020
What's wrong with that?

482
00:27:54,650 --> 00:27:56,150
You just wanted to use the Gantang Post

483
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:57,700
and the three brothers

484
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:58,800
to kill people and rake in fortunes for you!

485
00:28:01,170 --> 00:28:02,250
Over the past five years,

486
00:28:02,590 --> 00:28:03,980
all the money and goods

487
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:04,700
Liu Shiqi gave you

488
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:08,770
have been recorded on this.

489
00:28:09,530 --> 00:28:10,790
Liu Shiba recorded them.

490
00:28:14,530 --> 00:28:15,630
Sheriff Su,

491
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:18,550
do you know since when

492
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:19,910
I've been suspecting you?

493
00:28:21,030 --> 00:28:22,670
Since the first time

494
00:28:22,690 --> 00:28:23,860
we met.

495
00:28:24,630 --> 00:28:26,260
It was late at night.

496
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:28,220
When you realized

497
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:29,870
that it was something about the Gantang Post,

498
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:31,650
you deliberately dismissed

499
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:33,030
the constables on duty

500
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:36,410
and brought with you your trusted aides,

501
00:28:37,180 --> 00:28:38,810
those who are sitting

502
00:28:38,990 --> 00:28:40,280
on the ground outside.

503
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:46,500
Magistrate,

504
00:28:46,910 --> 00:28:47,470
I did it

505
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:48,660
because I had no better choice.

506
00:28:49,070 --> 00:28:50,420
Gantang County is very poor.

507
00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:52,190
Even you can't receive your salaries on time,

508
00:28:52,410 --> 00:28:53,610
let alone me

509
00:28:53,630 --> 00:28:54,580
and my men.

510
00:28:55,450 --> 00:28:56,450
Everyone had a share of the money

511
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:58,150
I made in the Gantang Post.

512
00:28:58,480 --> 00:28:59,290
That kept my men motivated

513
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:00,800
to investigate other cases.

514
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:01,530
Shut up!

515
00:29:02,330 --> 00:29:03,770
You're supposed to catch criminals,

516
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:05,470
not become a criminal yourself!

517
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:07,590
Can't believe you have the balls to justify yourself.

518
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:09,420
Please rest assured, Commander Su.

519
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:12,140
I will never

520
00:29:12,310 --> 00:29:13,480
let a scumbag like him

521
00:29:13,510 --> 00:29:14,340
get away with it.

522
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:21,970
Liu Shiqi,

523
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,520
you already got so many treasures

524
00:29:24,750 --> 00:29:26,750
behind Sheriff Su's back,

525
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:28,910
but you were too greedy

526
00:29:29,410 --> 00:29:31,170
to escape before it was too late.

527
00:29:31,780 --> 00:29:33,540
If you had run away

528
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:34,460
after Liu Shiba was arrested,

529
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:36,300
I would have no idea

530
00:29:36,330 --> 00:29:37,820
where to find you.

531
00:29:38,570 --> 00:29:40,940
Su Wuming,

532
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:44,020
I'm a fool

533
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:45,360
to not have recognized you sooner.

534
00:29:46,170 --> 00:29:47,680
If I'd known that you were the man

535
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:49,510
who messed up with my plan last time,

536
00:29:49,530 --> 00:29:51,070
I would've sent Liu Shijiu

537
00:29:51,090 --> 00:29:53,260
to tear you into pieces and eat you alive.

538
00:29:56,460 --> 00:29:58,480
You killed your father,

539
00:29:59,650 --> 00:30:01,200
but Liu Shiba still

540
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:02,730
took you as his brother.

541
00:30:04,050 --> 00:30:04,970
Although it was against his will,

542
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:07,790
he stayed with you

543
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:10,200
in the Gantang Post anyway.

544
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:13,180
He bore all the blame

545
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,690
himself

546
00:30:15,110 --> 00:30:16,060
so that

547
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:17,890
you and Liu Shijiu could get away with it.

548
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:23,200
Have you ever felt indebted to him?

549
00:30:24,140 --> 00:30:25,500
Did you talk with

550
00:30:25,530 --> 00:30:26,520
Sheriff Su

551
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:29,520
to try to save him?

552
00:30:31,410 --> 00:30:32,260
No.

553
00:30:33,270 --> 00:30:34,970
He should have died long ago.

554
00:30:35,710 --> 00:30:36,580
He was the favorite son

555
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:38,320
of that old prick.

556
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:40,040
I can't hate him more!

557
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:42,880
In the past years in the Gantang Post,

558
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:45,140
if he hadn't got in our way,

559
00:30:45,570 --> 00:30:47,130
we could've killed more people

560
00:30:47,690 --> 00:30:49,360
and looted even more

561
00:30:49,390 --> 00:30:50,300
money and treasure!

562
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:53,300
My mother should've

563
00:30:53,330 --> 00:30:54,870
only given birth to me.

564
00:30:55,330 --> 00:30:56,260
I'm so smart.

565
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:58,230
I'm popular with women.

566
00:30:59,050 --> 00:31:01,310
I would definitely be able

567
00:31:01,490 --> 00:31:03,810
to live a rich and carefree life!

568
00:32:05,730 --> 00:32:06,290
Sir,

569
00:32:06,890 --> 00:32:08,860
among those three brothers,

570
00:32:08,890 --> 00:32:10,010
who do you think is the most pitiful one?

571
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:11,070
Liu Shiba or Liu Shijiu?

572
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:13,260
You've been silent all this time

573
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:14,830
because you're thinking about that?

574
00:32:14,990 --> 00:32:15,680
Yes.

575
00:32:16,180 --> 00:32:17,420
I grew up in a poor family.

576
00:32:18,050 --> 00:32:19,310
I never thought

577
00:32:19,370 --> 00:32:20,740
that someone's life could be harder than mine.

578
00:32:21,530 --> 00:32:23,280
Magistrate Wang is a kind-hearted official.

579
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:25,800
Liu Shiba didn't kill anyone.

580
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:28,240
Perhaps he won't be sentenced to death.

581
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:30,900
Commander Su, what's on your mind?

582
00:32:33,410 --> 00:32:35,380
In less than ten days,

583
00:32:35,490 --> 00:32:37,170
we'll arrive in Nanzhou.

584
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:38,650
By then,

585
00:32:39,420 --> 00:32:41,820
if my beard hasn't grown back,

586
00:32:42,370 --> 00:32:44,440
I'll be so embarrassed

587
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:45,710
when people look at me.

588
00:32:48,060 --> 00:32:49,420
Then let's speed up

589
00:32:49,670 --> 00:32:50,820
to reach Nanzhou in eight days.

590
00:32:51,060 --> 00:32:52,170
I can't wait

591
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:53,760
to see how embarrassed you'll get.

592
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:34,679
Minister Lu.

593
00:34:36,530 --> 00:34:37,449
What are you brooding over?

594
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:40,150
I don't think

595
00:34:40,489 --> 00:34:41,610
I've written my thoughts on my face.

596
00:34:43,139 --> 00:34:44,760
Prefectural Governor Xiong invited you back

597
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:46,600
to be the Minister of Justice again.

598
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:48,270
Both of us are happy for you.

599
00:34:49,130 --> 00:34:49,719
Yeah.

600
00:34:50,170 --> 00:34:51,600
It's our honor to be at your service.

601
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:53,670
But it's rainy every day

602
00:34:53,699 --> 00:34:55,449
in Nanzhou.

603
00:34:55,969 --> 00:34:57,240
There's nothing to keep me occupied.

604
00:34:59,870 --> 00:35:00,590
I get it.

605
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:03,210
You found the rainy weather annoying?

606
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:04,700
Don't worry.

607
00:35:05,260 --> 00:35:05,850
It'll end in half a month.

608
00:35:05,890 --> 00:35:06,450
What?

609
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:07,500
One month at most.

610
00:35:07,930 --> 00:35:08,820
It's the monsoon season after all.

611
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:10,100
It'll keep raining for another month?

612
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:11,320
In the monsoon season,

613
00:35:11,730 --> 00:35:12,770
one should just

614
00:35:13,070 --> 00:35:14,620
drink, sleep, and dream.

615
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:18,610
I feel like

616
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:19,680
I'm getting moldy.

617
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:21,740
Why don't we go find a tavern

618
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:22,300
and have a drink?

619
00:35:22,990 --> 00:35:23,700
Good idea.

620
00:35:37,190 --> 00:35:38,040
Do you know that guy?

621
00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:39,460
Who is that?

622
00:35:40,150 --> 00:35:40,820
He's Dong Lang.

623
00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:42,700
Yes.

624
00:35:43,210 --> 00:35:43,730
It's him.

625
00:35:45,290 --> 00:35:45,960
Who is he?

626
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:46,500
A beggar.

627
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:48,150
He's been begging on the streets of Nanzhou

628
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:48,810
since he was a boy.

629
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:53,200
Was he ever convicted of theft?

630
00:35:55,580 --> 00:35:56,220
No.

631
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,770
[Dong Lang, a Beggar]

632
00:36:05,020 --> 00:36:05,420
Dong Lang!

633
00:36:11,230 --> 00:36:11,920
Catch him!

634
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:19,380
He didn't steal those things.

635
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:20,700
They

636
00:36:20,770 --> 00:36:21,860
were hidden in the walls.

637
00:36:22,420 --> 00:36:23,180
I guess they were put there

638
00:36:24,070 --> 00:36:25,730
by someone building the Confucian temple.

639
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:26,670
Yes.

640
00:36:27,180 --> 00:36:28,910
That Confucian temple is quite magnificent.

641
00:36:31,330 --> 00:36:32,490
Who built that temple?

642
00:36:33,670 --> 00:36:34,260
The Anonymous.

643
00:36:36,730 --> 00:36:37,450
Here's the story.

644
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:38,250
Ten years ago,

645
00:36:38,340 --> 00:36:39,530
someone spent a large sum of money

646
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:40,580
in building a Confucian temple

647
00:36:40,620 --> 00:36:41,830
at the foot of the Minor Stone Bridge Mountain

648
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:42,980
in the city of Nanzhou.

649
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:44,100
But that man

650
00:36:44,140 --> 00:36:45,040
wouldn't reveal his identity,

651
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:46,570
so everyone simply called him The Anonymous.

652
00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:47,650
It's said to be an old man

653
00:36:47,910 --> 00:36:48,560
who died a long time ago

654
00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:49,530
and had no offspring.

655
00:36:49,670 --> 00:36:50,550
Does that temple have many worshippers?

656
00:36:51,070 --> 00:36:51,990
It did in a while after the temple was built,

657
00:36:52,570 --> 00:36:53,820
but few people visit it now.

658
00:36:54,990 --> 00:36:56,360
There have been a few students

659
00:36:56,390 --> 00:36:57,300
studying there for the exam in recent years.

660
00:36:57,580 --> 00:36:58,170
I've asked them.

661
00:36:58,370 --> 00:36:59,700
Those things don't belong to them.

662
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:02,070
Although Dong Lang didn't steal,

663
00:37:02,090 --> 00:37:02,970
he attempted to take

664
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:04,050
things that didn't belong to him.

665
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:05,050
So despicable.

666
00:37:05,580 --> 00:37:06,770
He blamed it on the rainy weather,

667
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:08,460
saying that he couldn't beg on the streets when it rained.

668
00:37:08,730 --> 00:37:09,980
Hunger must have addled his brains.

669
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:11,650
Perhaps he had dreams

670
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:12,210
which made him believe

671
00:37:12,350 --> 00:37:13,140
those valuable things

672
00:37:13,170 --> 00:37:13,920
belonged to him.

673
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:15,400
Total nonsense.

674
00:37:16,140 --> 00:37:17,020
He's gotten twenty strikes by the wood stave.

675
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:18,090
He's learned his lesson.

676
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:31,620
Please bless my husband, Confucius.

677
00:37:32,130 --> 00:37:33,160
Please help him

678
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:35,200
pass the exam this time.

679
00:37:43,150 --> 00:37:44,000
Stop nagging.

680
00:37:44,650 --> 00:37:45,120
Come here.

681
00:37:46,410 --> 00:37:47,220
Drink with me.

682
00:37:47,650 --> 00:37:48,980
I can't hold my liquor.

683
00:37:49,390 --> 00:37:50,170
Besides,

684
00:37:50,210 --> 00:37:51,460
how am I going to go home

685
00:37:51,890 --> 00:37:52,700
if I get drunk?

686
00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:54,500
Go home?

687
00:37:55,020 --> 00:37:56,010
After going home,

688
00:37:56,980 --> 00:37:58,740
you'll still be alone.

689
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:00,050
Behave!

690
00:38:00,210 --> 00:38:01,730
You've been studying with him.

691
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:03,760
Aren't you afraid that he'll find out?

692
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:04,790
There's nothing to be afraid of.

693
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:06,980
He's gone east to buy books.

694
00:38:07,270 --> 00:38:08,350
I counted the time.

695
00:38:08,790 --> 00:38:09,910
He won't come back

696
00:38:10,210 --> 00:38:11,530
in a while.

697
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:50,250
Lad,

698
00:38:50,550 --> 00:38:51,790
you have an umbrella in your hand.

699
00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:53,710
Why haven't you opened it?

700
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:55,880
Even if you don't mind getting soaked,

701
00:38:56,180 --> 00:38:58,250
you should shelter the books from the rain.

702
00:39:12,930 --> 00:39:13,610
Was that

703
00:39:14,410 --> 00:39:15,410
just my illusion?

704
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:18,550
[Dugu Xiashu, a student in Nanzhou]

705
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:00,290
It's you.

706
00:40:02,050 --> 00:40:02,990
Why are you home?

707
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:05,730
[Qinghong, Dugu's Wife]

708
00:40:05,030 --> 00:40:06,560
Where do you expect me to be?

709
00:40:07,340 --> 00:40:08,350
What was that sound?

710
00:40:12,020 --> 00:40:13,060
When you are not home,

711
00:40:13,330 --> 00:40:13,980
I put it on the bed

712
00:40:14,010 --> 00:40:15,330
when I sleep.

713
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:16,980
If a thief comes in,

714
00:40:17,250 --> 00:40:18,490
I can kick it off the bed

715
00:40:18,690 --> 00:40:19,780
and scare the thief away.

716
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,210
I heard some noise and thought…

717
00:40:25,810 --> 00:40:28,390
So the thief was you.

718
00:40:29,370 --> 00:40:30,400
When did you come back?

719
00:40:30,820 --> 00:40:32,060
I didn't hear you at all.

720
00:40:32,390 --> 00:40:33,340
I just arrived.

721
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:36,130
So you know you have home.

722
00:40:36,450 --> 00:40:37,060
Why don't you

723
00:40:37,090 --> 00:40:38,150
stay in the Confucian temple forever?

724
00:40:38,620 --> 00:40:41,040
That way, you won't blame me again if you fail the exam next year.

725
00:40:47,530 --> 00:40:48,060
Dear,

726
00:40:48,220 --> 00:40:48,900
don't be angry.

727
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:50,640
I've come back to see you.

728
00:40:54,270 --> 00:40:55,350
Glad to know

729
00:40:55,370 --> 00:40:57,210
you haven't forgotten me.

730
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:01,330
Tonight,

731
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:04,580
I'll stay home with you.

732
00:41:07,850 --> 00:41:08,480
Dear,

733
00:41:09,030 --> 00:41:09,790
didn't you go out

734
00:41:10,370 --> 00:41:11,390
this afternoon?

735
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:13,600
It's been raining all day.

736
00:41:13,650 --> 00:41:14,570
I couldn't go anywhere.

737
00:41:14,820 --> 00:41:16,340
I've been sleeping at home.

738
00:41:17,310 --> 00:41:18,260
But…

739
00:41:20,070 --> 00:41:21,370
I seemed to have a nightmare.

740
00:41:24,050 --> 00:41:25,250
I'll buy you

741
00:41:25,270 --> 00:41:26,160
a peach wood sword

742
00:41:26,290 --> 00:41:26,980
and hang it on the bedpost.

743
00:41:27,290 --> 00:41:28,140
No evil spirits

744
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:29,190
will dare to approach you then.

745
00:41:31,420 --> 00:41:32,670
You are so sweet.

746
00:41:34,090 --> 00:41:35,090
But...

747
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:37,360
I didn't dream of evil spirits

748
00:41:37,670 --> 00:41:39,120
or monsters.

749
00:41:39,740 --> 00:41:40,930
I dreamed

750
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:43,210
that an obnoxious person

751
00:41:43,420 --> 00:41:45,050
threw a pile of books at my head.

752
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:49,810
Really?

753
00:41:53,970 --> 00:41:54,750
Yeah.

754
00:41:55,100 --> 00:41:56,180
I dreamed

755
00:41:56,260 --> 00:41:57,690
that I went to send you clothes

756
00:41:58,030 --> 00:41:59,130
but you weren't in the temple.

757
00:41:59,830 --> 00:42:01,460
So I went to the ancestral hall

758
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:02,800
to pay my respects to Confucius.

759
00:42:03,130 --> 00:42:03,950
I prayed to him that you could win tops marks

760
00:42:03,980 --> 00:42:05,060
in the imperial exams next year.

761
00:42:05,990 --> 00:42:07,840
But some crazy guy

762
00:42:08,130 --> 00:42:09,490
threw books in through the window

763
00:42:09,510 --> 00:42:10,470
and hit my head.

764
00:42:11,330 --> 00:42:12,860
It still hurts.
