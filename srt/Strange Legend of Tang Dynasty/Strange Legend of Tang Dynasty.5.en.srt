00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:48,890
Because of the Chang'an black tea,

5
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:50,740
I offended most of the officials

6
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:51,810
in the court.

7
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:54,500
I heard that Her Highness is very angry.

8
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,900
His Majesty is also blaming me for being nosy.

9
00:01:59,229 --> 00:01:59,780
What?

10
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,290
Do you regret it?

11
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:04,050
No.

12
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:06,570
Xijun is the apple of my eyes.

13
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,320
As long as I can save her,

14
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:11,320
I will die for her without regrets.

15
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:15,290
You love your daughter so much.

16
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,800
I will do my best to help you.

17
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:19,670
I trust you.

18
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:22,010
Because you are Detective Di's disciple.

19
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:23,420
At tonight's ghost marriage,

20
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:26,160
you must ensure that my daughter will be

21
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:28,300
safe and sound.

The nether marriage in Chang'an must pass by the Ghost Market.

27

Are you afraid, Miss. Xijun?

28

As long as I can live happily forever with Xiao,

29

I fear nothing!

30

What brought you here?

36
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:05,160
I'm here to have a drink with you.

37
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:09,060
I'm not in the mood today.

38
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:11,790
Because you are upset?

39
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:15,140
How did you know?

40
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,560
Don't worry.

41
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:18,780
It's not because of your health.

42
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:20,510
It's all because of

43
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:22,380
this special day.

44
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:25,740
I have followed my teacher, Detective Di,

45
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:26,720
for almost ten years.

46

Every 15th day of the 7th lunar month, the Hungry-Ghost Festival,

my teacher would feel uncomfortable.

48
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:34,860
On that day he always asked me to have a drink with him.

49
00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:36,370
And he would feel a lot better.

50
00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:39,290
I've sent my servant to buy us some food and wine.

51

Why have I never thought of it in that way?

65

All you need to do is protect the palanquin,

66
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:09,420
and wait for me to kill this beast.

67

Where did she go?

84
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:38,540
I asked the four of you to guard the palanquin.

85

What happened?

86
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:40,270

Yes.

89

I didn't even blink.

90
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:43,820
Could it be...

91
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:44,660

92

Wait.

101
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:25,620
The secret tunnel in the Ghost Market is dangerous.

102
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:27,350
Put on your golden armor to protect yourself.

103
00:10:34,450 --> 00:10:35,270
All of you can go back first.

104

This...

105
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:37,950
Wait again.

106
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:39,840
The secret tunnel

107
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:41,440
is full of traps and tricks.

108
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:42,790
I'm useful. You should take me with you.

109
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:53,200
You mean

110
00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:54,390
we are useless in the tunnel?

111
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:55,240
Nonsense!

112
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,200
I killed the villian with my own hands.

113

Yes.

114
00:10:58,380 --> 00:10:59,700
How can you say we're useless?

115
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:00,580
I'll go.

116
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:01,440
Me too.

117
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:02,020
Me too.

118
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:02,630
And me.

119
00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:14,420
No.

120
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:17,110

123
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:25,260

only tonight, the yinqi is the strongest.

128

When I was following my teacher,

129
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,420
I had to attend to him

130
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:45,870
by the bed.

131
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:48,950
But I'm not Detective Di.

132
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:50,800
I dare not ask you to attend to me.

133
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:53,470
Brother,

134
00:11:57,670 --> 00:11:59,190
I'm your subordinate.

135
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:03,400
You are no difference from my teacher.

136
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:18,700
Brother,

137
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:21,360
You're still here?

138
00:12:21,770 --> 00:12:24,080
I'll be here for you all night.

139
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:27,470
I won't leave until dawn.

140
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:33,380
You're so considerate.

141
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:37,280
No sleep.

142
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:38,080
Let's go.

143
00:12:39,170 --> 00:12:40,440
Let's have some tea together.

144
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,560
Are we going to drink Chang'an black tea?

145
00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:54,460
Chang'an black tea?

146
00:12:57,140 --> 00:12:58,700
That's too expensive.

147
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,160
I don't have it.

148
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:26,210

149
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:27,420

150
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:30,000
Come and take a look.

151
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:31,430
What is this?

152
00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:37,120
Brother.

153
00:13:37,730 --> 00:13:38,690
What is this?

154
00:13:42,270 --> 00:13:43,330
What are you...

155
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:45,420

156
00:14:06,570 --> 00:14:07,880
Greetings, Immortal Venerable.

157
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:09,860
You guys,

158
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:11,150
ambush outside.

159
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:14,140
Whoever kills Lu Lingfeng

160
00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:15,350
will be heavily rewarded.

161
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:16,900
Yes.

162
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:46,310
What a beautiful bride!

163
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:49,390
Congratulations on becoming a god tonight.

164
00:14:50,310 --> 00:14:51,400
You have something to say?

165
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:53,630
You can say it.

166
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:59,550
Let go off me.

167
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:01,660
My father is the Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Personnel Administration.

168
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:05,090
What a high-ranking official!

169
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:06,700
I'm so scared.

170
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:14,590
This is Lady Shiyi's unique skill.

171

You can't make a sound

172
00:15:16,730 --> 00:15:18,830
within two hours.

173
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,860
But you can keep looking at me.

174
00:15:22,330 --> 00:15:23,840
and yourself.

175
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:25,840
Immortal Venerable, you can focus on making tea,

176
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:27,260
and I'll kill Su Wuming.

177
00:15:29,050 --> 00:15:29,830
Forget it.

178
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,460
Su Wuming has a complicated knowledge.

179
00:15:32,930 --> 00:15:34,570
He even knows Yin and Yang.

180
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:35,760
We don't have to

181
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:38,260
kill him ourselves.

182
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:40,300
Let him

183
00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:41,560
flow into the dark river along with water,

184
00:15:42,190 --> 00:15:44,720
and be eaten by the fish in the Qu River.

185
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:46,120
It's a quick death for him.

186
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:00,760
Can you smell

187
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:03,010
the fragrance on this red cloth?

188
00:16:03,650 --> 00:16:06,290
This spice can keep your body from decaying.

189
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:10,190
Remember to be grateful.

190
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:25,910
Wait.

191
00:16:28,810 --> 00:16:31,810
I am nobody.

192
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:34,020
You can kill me anytime.

193
00:16:34,050 --> 00:16:34,780
What's the rush?

194
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:53,950
Su Wuming, Sheriff of Chang'an.

195
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:56,680
Greetings, Magistrate Yuan.

196
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:05,619
The mask of Fang Xiang God you wear

197
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:07,680
is for the bride, right?

198
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,030
Take it off.

199
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:12,359
Let's be honest today, OK?

200
00:17:32,930 --> 00:17:33,930
Su Wuming.

201
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:38,190
You don't feel dizzy at the sight of blood at all.

202
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:40,510
I did when I was a child.

203
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:43,330
After I followed my teacher Di,

204
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:45,600
and learned how to solve cases,

205
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:47,350
then I won't faint.

206
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:49,780
However, that day at Pei Jian's house,

207
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:51,540
the tea came suddenly.

208
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:52,740
The smell of blood in it

209
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:54,820
indeed makes me feel dizzy.

210
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:56,700
I had to pretend I fainted,

211
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:58,430
so that

212
00:17:58,460 --> 00:17:59,790
I wouldn't offend Assistant Minister Pei.

213
00:18:00,530 --> 00:18:02,030
Since when have you

214
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:04,630
suspected me?

215
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:07,580
The former Sheriff Wu Daqi

216
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:09,380
died strangely.

217
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:11,280
And the old case files were lost

218
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:12,780
inexplicably.

219
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:15,030
How could the diligent magistrate of Chang'an

220
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:18,330
be so foolish?

221
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,760
All the files were confiscated,

222
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,880
and no one has returned them.

223
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:27,580
Just because of this?

224
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:29,060
That day,

225
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:31,800
according to the Eight Diagrams,

226
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:33,580
I deduced the location of the dead bride's body

227
00:18:33,610 --> 00:18:35,850
during the past year.

228
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:37,540
You rushed here

229
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:40,510
but just asked a small question.

230
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:42,630
The Imperial Guards

231
00:18:42,770 --> 00:18:44,030
are in charge of the tea dealer now.

232
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:46,300
But they caught too many.

233
00:18:47,410 --> 00:18:49,640
The Imperial Prison was full.

234
00:18:49,850 --> 00:18:52,590
So they sent many prisoners to Chang'an.

235
00:18:54,910 --> 00:18:56,670
What should we do?

236
00:18:58,260 --> 00:19:00,050
Are you asking me?

237
00:19:00,730 --> 00:19:02,760
Actually, you just want to test me

238
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:05,350
whether I've connected the missing bride case

239
00:19:05,390 --> 00:19:07,330
with the Chang'an black tea.

240
00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:10,930
So you're just making wild guesses?

241
00:19:11,810 --> 00:19:14,670
Is this what Detective Di taught you?

242
00:19:15,410 --> 00:19:17,500
I was in danger in the Ghost Market that day.

243
00:19:18,030 --> 00:19:20,920
Magistrate Yuan was worried and came to see me.

244
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:23,470
What did you say back then?

245
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:25,230
Last night, I saw

246
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:27,970
all the constables in Chang'an were set out.

247
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,950
So I came here to look for you.

248
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:32,930
You were not there at all.

249
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:35,670
Did you lead the people

250
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:37,050
to investigate in the Ghost Market?

251
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:40,230
So what?

252
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:42,880
What's the flaw?

253
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:45,010
I have a habit.

254
00:19:45,130 --> 00:19:46,560
If I goes out at night,

255
00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:49,310
I will be afraid there might be thieves coming in my house, so...

256
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:01,440
When I went back, the coin was still there.

257
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:02,780
On the incense ash in the room,

258
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:05,300
only left a string of cat paw prints.

259
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:07,190
Su Wuming.

260
00:20:08,090 --> 00:20:10,620
I really underestimated you.

261
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:14,280
Actually, that day in the Ghost Market,

262
00:20:14,870 --> 00:20:17,600
when the prestigious Immortal Venerable opened his mouth,

263
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:20,510
I was sure of my deduction.

264
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:21,820
Shoot!

265
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,910
Don't let them escape from the cave.

266
00:20:24,610 --> 00:20:26,530
Because my ears have always been sharp.

267
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,730
I have never made a mistake in recognizing a person by their voice.

268
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,170
Yuan Lai,

269
00:20:31,790 --> 00:20:33,390
I didn't identify you immediately

270
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:35,880
because I wanted you

271
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:38,380
to show your true face.

272
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:59,150
I just don't understand

273
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:02,930
why did you throw yourself in to the trap?

274
00:22:03,630 --> 00:22:05,070
This is a habit I've developed

275
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:06,420
for years following my teacher.

276
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:09,250
We must investigate every mysterious case till the end.

277
00:22:09,270 --> 00:22:12,350
To solve the mystery, we can die with no regrets.

278
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:17,160
Die with no regrets.

279
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:20,610
Wu Daqi said the same thing

280
00:22:21,150 --> 00:22:22,520
when he was alive.

281
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:24,110
Sheriff Wu,

282
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:26,590
was killed by you

283
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:27,550
with Chang'an black tea, right?

284
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:29,540
Wu was rough yet careful.

285
00:22:29,570 --> 00:22:30,440
He was very good.

286
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:32,900
After investigating the missing bride case,

287
00:22:32,930 --> 00:22:33,940
he follwed the leads to me.

288
00:22:36,770 --> 00:22:38,630
I have no choice.

289
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:41,670
But I didn't hurt him.

290
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:44,620
I'm just giving him the immortal tea

291
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:46,900
to help him become a god.

292
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:49,630
If I am right,

293
00:22:50,190 --> 00:22:51,510
the tea Sheriff Wu drank

294
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:52,720
was different from others, right?

295
00:22:53,930 --> 00:22:55,940
Su Wuming, you are indeed extraordinary.

296
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:57,620
You can even know this.

297
00:22:58,060 --> 00:22:59,120
I learned from

298
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:00,770
the bailiff in the yamen of Chang'an.

299
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:03,450
Sheriff Wu was impartial

300
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:05,410
and had extraordinary martial arts skills.

301
00:23:05,530 --> 00:23:07,820
There's no sign before he drowned, inexplicably.

302
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:11,020
If it weren't for the excessive dose of Western Magic Grass,

303
00:23:11,050 --> 00:23:12,900
there would be no other explanation.

304
00:23:13,490 --> 00:23:14,150
He deserved it.

305
00:23:14,490 --> 00:23:15,560
He was just a warrior.

306
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:16,830
Just because the tea was free

307
00:23:16,850 --> 00:23:19,120
and he thought the tea was nice, he drank that lot.

308
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:20,950
I didn't expect

309
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,410
he would die so soon.

310
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:28,460
General.

311
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:29,450
General.

312
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:34,840
There are five enemies.

313
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:36,730
All are well-trained archers.

314
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:38,110
We shouldn't attack head-on.

315
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:40,020
Chicken Fed

316
00:23:40,290 --> 00:23:40,940
has found out the real situation of

317
00:23:40,970 --> 00:23:41,900
the roads on both sides.

318
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:42,650
We can sneak in.

319
00:23:43,610 --> 00:23:44,740
But the cave is narrow.

320
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:46,050
We can't use our skills.

321
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:48,210
But we can split up into three groups.

322
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:50,060
One group takes off their clothes

323
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,880
and makes a shield to attract the enemy's attention.

324
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:54,530
The second will surround them.

325
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:57,020
The rest follows me to take the chance to attack.

326
00:23:57,660 --> 00:23:59,870
We can definitely annihilate the enemy.

327
00:24:25,990 --> 00:24:26,430
Go!

328
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:54,840
Check if anyone is injured.

329
00:24:57,740 --> 00:24:58,360
One is shot.

330
00:24:58,530 --> 00:24:59,470
Everyone else is fine.

331
00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:00,700
Fei.

332
00:25:01,930 --> 00:25:02,880
Here you are.

333
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:06,560
Leave the injured to me. Don't worry.

334
00:25:07,910 --> 00:25:08,320
Over there.

335
00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:11,380
This is the end of the secret tunnel,

336
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:12,840
which is heavily guarded.

337
00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:13,920
It seems we are close to

338
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:14,670
their den.

339
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:16,300
Search carefully.

340
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:17,880
Is there anything strange about this wall?

341
00:25:18,450 --> 00:25:18,950
Yes.

342
00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:19,900
Immortal Venerable,

343
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:21,850
stop talking to him.

344
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:23,350
It's high time

345
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:25,180
that you make immortal tea.

346
00:25:25,630 --> 00:25:27,800
Leave Su Wuming to me.

347
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:28,680
Wait.

348
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:32,080
About how to make

349
00:25:32,110 --> 00:25:32,960
Chang'an black tea,

350
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:34,360
I have many questions.

351
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:35,570
For example,

352
00:25:35,870 --> 00:25:37,690
what is

353
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:39,200
the scary thing

354
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:40,140
in your hand?

355
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:42,180
Let me guess...

356
00:25:43,550 --> 00:25:46,080
Emperor Gaozong of our dynasty suffered from eye dizziness.

357
00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:47,890
At that time, an imperial physician

358
00:25:47,930 --> 00:25:49,780
cured this disease

359
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:51,050
by bloodletting on the top of his head.

360
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:54,290
Are you...?

361
00:25:57,820 --> 00:25:59,060
Why are you playing dumb?

362
00:26:00,270 --> 00:26:02,250
You're Detective Di's disciple after all.

363
00:26:03,130 --> 00:26:04,310
Didn't you notice that

364
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:06,290
during the autopsy?

365
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:12,960
When I saw Dou Cong's body being kept for days

366
00:26:13,230 --> 00:26:14,540
with no spot,

367
00:26:14,810 --> 00:26:16,140
I've thought

368
00:26:16,370 --> 00:26:18,270
that her blood was released.

369
00:26:19,390 --> 00:26:20,670
Then I found

370
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:22,790
there was a hole on her head.

371
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:24,630
So everything was clear.

372
00:26:25,710 --> 00:26:27,100
The murderer kills only brides.

373
00:26:27,130 --> 00:26:29,930
Is this because brides have a lot of yinqi inside?

374
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:32,100
And he hides their bodies in the corresponding direction

375
00:26:32,130 --> 00:26:33,770
so that their souls won't gather.

376
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,550
Use the Soul Returning Incense to protect their skin

377
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:38,180
so that they can wear a mask for a long time.

378
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:43,270
Now is the Eve of the Hungry Ghost Festival.

379
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:46,070
Although the moon is in the sky,

380
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:48,510
it's the extreme yin day

381
00:26:48,710 --> 00:26:50,040
in a year.

382
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:53,330
I used the blood of the Assistant Minister's daughter

383
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:55,500
at the ghost marriage

384
00:26:56,850 --> 00:26:58,420
and used the skills

385
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:01,400
really carefully

386
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:04,420
to make the best

387
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:06,460
Chang'an black tea.

388
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:07,940
The price for every liang of tea

389
00:27:08,490 --> 00:27:09,720
is one ingot of gold.

390
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:11,640
It's quite cheap.

391
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:15,120
Putting the mask of Fang Xiang God on the dead

392
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,360
is to

393
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:18,220
enlighten their souls.

394
00:27:18,610 --> 00:27:19,290
Yes.

395
00:27:19,690 --> 00:27:21,670
I've thought it through for them.

396
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:24,010
You are afraid that their souls

397
00:27:24,030 --> 00:27:24,900
will come back to take revenge on you!

398
00:27:25,170 --> 00:27:25,620
Afraid?

399
00:27:29,790 --> 00:27:31,480
In a year or so,

400
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:33,490
all the officials in Chang'an

401
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:34,780
and even the royal family

402
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:37,700
will rely on my Chang'an black tea

403
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:38,930
to extend their life.

404
00:27:39,570 --> 00:27:40,560
At that time,

405
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:44,090
I would be the real Master of Chang'an.

406
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:45,410
Who am I afraid of?

407
00:27:54,290 --> 00:27:54,770
Immortal Venerable.

408
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:56,190
Those people

409
00:27:56,210 --> 00:27:56,860
are all rubbish!

410
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:58,910
They couldn't even defend a single Lu Lingfeng.

411
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:04,020
That wall is made of a huge boulder.

412
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:05,830
No one can open it.

413
00:28:06,710 --> 00:28:07,780
Let them knock.

414
00:28:08,150 --> 00:28:10,000
Go and kill Su Wuming.

415
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:12,250
The special black tea should be launched soon.

416
00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:14,140
I have no time

417
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,150
to listen to his nagging.

418
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:18,700
Don't you know that if you want to create the ultimate immortal tea,

419
00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:21,140
I am more suitable

420
00:28:21,370 --> 00:28:22,480
than the daughter of the Pei family?

421
00:28:24,410 --> 00:28:24,970
Yuan Lai.

422
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:28,190
Don't you need the body of extreme yin?

423
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:30,460
Actually, I am.

424
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:32,300
I think you're afraid of death.

425
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:33,840
Nonsense.

426
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:35,340
Fifteen years ago,

427
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:37,750
assassins poisoned Detective Di.

428
00:28:37,890 --> 00:28:38,820
This was known to all.

429
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:40,110
You haven't forgotten that, have you?

430
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:40,910
Wait.

431
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:42,700
Do you know

432
00:28:42,730 --> 00:28:44,290
why didn't the assassins succeed?

433
00:28:44,870 --> 00:28:45,870
That's because

434
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:48,820
I was with Detective Di,

435
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:50,880
and tested medicine for him every day.

436
00:28:52,470 --> 00:28:54,360
That poison was so strong.

437
00:28:55,510 --> 00:28:58,610
I passed out for seven days and nights.

438
00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:01,090
My master summoned several famous physicians

439
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:02,400
from Luoyang to save my life.

440
00:29:02,970 --> 00:29:04,750
I took the antidote.

441
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:06,860
Then they used Tianshan Keelen Tea preserved in the palace

442
00:29:07,050 --> 00:29:08,990
to made decoction,

443
00:29:09,150 --> 00:29:11,530
and then bathe me in that decoction to detoxify me.

444
00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:16,720
Although the decoction was warm like spring,

445
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:19,080
it was extremely-yin in the world.

446
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:19,750
Therefore,

447
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:23,060
I am the one

448
00:29:24,330 --> 00:29:25,520
who is most yin inside.

449
00:29:39,390 --> 00:29:41,270
By the way, Assistant Minister Pei

450
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,280
helped me a lot.

451
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:45,790
Today, I sacrifice myself

452
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:47,370
to save his daughter's life.

453
00:29:48,410 --> 00:29:50,330
That would be my way to pay him a debt of gratitude

454
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:51,530
Come on.

455
00:29:52,010 --> 00:29:53,000
Put her down.

456
00:29:53,450 --> 00:29:54,210
Put me on.

457
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:57,060
Make your tea with my blood.

458
00:29:57,340 --> 00:29:58,050
Think about it.

459
00:29:58,550 --> 00:29:59,840
A sip of the tea

460
00:30:00,010 --> 00:30:01,210
would be revenge on me.

461
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:02,090
Don't listen to him.

462
00:30:02,350 --> 00:30:03,530
He just wants to buy time.

463
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:34,920
Magistrate Yuan?

464
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:36,860
-Magistrate Yuan. -Magistrate Yuan.

465
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:37,710
This...

466
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:47,000
Magistrate is here.

467
00:30:47,350 --> 00:30:48,260
Kneel down now!

468
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:49,470
Yuan Lai.

469
00:30:49,930 --> 00:30:50,590
It's you! Really?

470
00:30:51,130 --> 00:30:53,030
You are the magistrate,

471
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:54,390
but killed 12 innocent brides.

472
00:30:54,770 --> 00:30:56,490
You are the culprit who used the evil tea to disturb Chang'an.

473
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:03,160
Miss Xijun,

474
00:31:03,740 --> 00:31:05,500
That is the one who wields the sword for you.

475
00:31:05,690 --> 00:31:06,290
Don't worry.

476
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:07,460
He has great martial arts skills.

477
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:08,550
He can save us.

478
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:12,540
Su Wuming.

479
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:15,950
Pei Jian defamed Chang'an black tea

480
00:31:16,730 --> 00:31:19,010
and organised a ghost marriage for his daughter.

481
00:31:19,190 --> 00:31:20,380
It seems that these are all your ideas.

482
00:31:20,910 --> 00:31:22,500
You're just a county sheriff.

483
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:25,930
How could you manipulate a high-ranking official?

484
00:31:27,310 --> 00:31:28,330
How dare you!

485
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:28,900
Yuan Lai,

486
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:31,140
Sheriff Su has been suspicious of you.

487
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:32,120
He didn't expose you

488
00:31:32,310 --> 00:31:33,780
because he wanted to convince you.

489
00:31:33,930 --> 00:31:35,060
Surrender now.

490
00:31:36,650 --> 00:31:37,280
What a joke.

491
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:40,820
You ineffective troops

492
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:42,870
want me to throw in the towel?

493
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:45,010
Lady Shiyi,

494
00:31:45,710 --> 00:31:47,050
we have no choice

495
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:49,330
but to kill tonight.

496
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:11,870
Gentlemen,

497
00:32:12,210 --> 00:32:13,640
Yuan Lai is the county magistrate.

498
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:14,650
But he is the real culprit.

499
00:32:14,850 --> 00:32:15,450
Take him down.

500
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:17,790
The court will reward you with merits.

501
00:32:19,210 --> 00:32:19,850
Wait.

502
00:32:19,870 --> 00:32:20,670
Go! Go!

503
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:22,150
Don't you want to hear

504
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:25,250
my sincere words?

505
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:27,290
You're in an important position.

506
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:28,780
How shameless you are!

507
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:30,210
I want to know

508
00:32:30,510 --> 00:32:31,540
why you did that.

509
00:32:33,890 --> 00:32:35,210
After the founding of this dynasty,

510
00:32:35,970 --> 00:32:37,220
reforms and changes took place.

511
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:39,990
The influence of my family declined.

512
00:32:40,370 --> 00:32:41,920
There were only few aristocrats surrounding us.

513
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:45,120
I was the descendant of the former Emperor.

514
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:46,830
I came from a noble family.

515
00:32:48,150 --> 00:32:52,230
Despite this, I had to take the exam to be an official.

516
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:54,690
With ten years of hard-working,

517
00:32:55,070 --> 00:32:57,150
I finally passed the top-level exam

518
00:32:57,510 --> 00:32:59,580
and became an official in Chang'an.

519
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:01,320
I've been working hard

520
00:33:01,930 --> 00:33:03,230
and diligent.

521
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:06,270
Under my management, the west side of the Zhuque Avenue

522
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:07,800
was well-organized.

523
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:09,720
But some people

524
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:12,870
used my disabled leg as an excuse

525
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:16,200
to stop me from promotion.

526
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:19,980
But they themselves

527
00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:24,750
took advantage of my political achievements

528
00:33:25,610 --> 00:33:26,740
and made me

529
00:33:27,090 --> 00:33:29,980
their stepping stone.

530
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:34,770
Now I'm already in my fifties,

531
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:37,880
but I'm still

532
00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:40,610
a county magistrate.

533
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:42,840
But the title is fancy:

534
00:33:43,710 --> 00:33:45,050
Magistrate of the Capital.

535
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:46,470
That's why you don't accept your fate.

536
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:47,790
That's why you even dare to use

537
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:48,950
the blood of innocent people

538
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:51,220
to make the so-called Chang'an black tea

539
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:52,690
and sell it at a high price.

540
00:33:53,050 --> 00:33:54,650
It's addictive and hallucinating.

541
00:33:55,310 --> 00:33:56,430
You use it to control officials at all levels.

542
00:33:57,880 --> 00:34:01,050
No one can stop my plan.

543
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:02,300
Lu Lingfeng,

544
00:34:02,620 --> 00:34:04,500
you've been disbanded from military power.

545
00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:07,790
Why don't you mind your own business?

546
00:34:08,170 --> 00:34:09,929
To make up for your grievances,

547
00:34:10,110 --> 00:34:11,600
so many people died for you.

548
00:34:12,139 --> 00:34:13,739
Don't you repent?

549
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:15,040
Repent?

550
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:18,480
With my talent,

551
00:34:19,139 --> 00:34:21,260
I should have been the Prime Minister.

552
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:22,469
Why should I repent?

553
00:34:23,719 --> 00:34:25,550
When I become the Prime Minister for 20 years,

554
00:34:25,570 --> 00:34:26,770
I would retire suscessfully.

555
00:34:28,190 --> 00:34:29,530
By then, I would repent.

556
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:32,469
You're too hostile

557
00:34:32,610 --> 00:34:34,090
to be the Prime Minister.

558
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:36,840
How dare you, Su Wuming!

559
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:38,820
I'll grant your wish today.

560
00:34:39,070 --> 00:34:40,560
I'll use your blood to make Chang'an black tea,

561
00:34:40,590 --> 00:34:41,400
and sell it to the Ghost Market

562
00:34:41,730 --> 00:34:42,380
at a low price.

563
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:46,050
Why are they arguing?

564
00:34:46,179 --> 00:34:46,860
Yeah.

565
00:34:46,889 --> 00:34:48,730
Do we need to fight or not?

566
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:37,710
Greetings, Immortal Venerable.

567
00:35:39,170 --> 00:35:40,220
Demons! Demons!

568
00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:42,000
There's no demon.

569
00:35:42,450 --> 00:35:44,410
Yes, don't be afraid.

570
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:46,480
Those two weirdos

571
00:35:46,670 --> 00:35:47,700
must be poisoned.

572
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:49,940
They've been sleeping in the clay figurine.

573
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:54,400
The Ghost Four.

574
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:57,060
How dare you, Yuan Lai!

575
00:35:57,810 --> 00:35:58,950
During the reign of Emperor Gaozong,

576
00:35:59,450 --> 00:36:01,000
the four assassins of the Ghost Tribe

577
00:36:01,050 --> 00:36:02,470
came to the capital to assassinate His Majesty.

578
00:36:02,590 --> 00:36:05,110
After being arrested and imprisoned in Chang'an,

579
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:06,520
they disappeared.

580
00:36:06,820 --> 00:36:07,960
It turns out that it was you...

581
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:09,300
To achieve great things,

582
00:36:09,590 --> 00:36:11,020
one needs to make early plans.

583
00:36:12,150 --> 00:36:14,340
Back then, to capture the Ghost Four,

584
00:36:14,430 --> 00:36:16,110
all the master-hands in Chang'an

585
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:17,240
were deployed, but still failed.

586
00:36:17,710 --> 00:36:20,030
Now, you, nobodies,

587
00:36:20,250 --> 00:36:21,810
daydream about winning over them?

588
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:23,930
Death is your only result.

589
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:26,700
Kill them!

590
00:36:27,210 --> 00:36:28,870
Kill them all!

591
00:36:29,430 --> 00:36:30,060
-Yes. -Yes.

592
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:37,090
I've killed

593
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:38,740
two of the Ghost Four.

594
00:36:38,910 --> 00:36:39,860
What are you afraid of?

595
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:15,470
Take the spear!

596
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:23,500
Go! Go! Go!

597
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:24,400
Brothers, go!

598
00:37:38,810 --> 00:37:40,440
Lu Lingfeng.

599
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:09,410
General.

600
00:38:09,710 --> 00:38:10,390
We're here.

601
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:11,320
Perfect timing.

602
00:38:11,650 --> 00:38:12,890
Work with me to kill those criminals.

603
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:13,370
Yes.

604
00:38:25,130 --> 00:38:25,780
General.

605
00:38:26,530 --> 00:38:27,160
General.

606
00:38:27,670 --> 00:38:28,710
Attack them one by one.

607
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:37,490
Guo Zhuang.

608
00:38:37,860 --> 00:38:38,740
Capture that demon.

609
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:39,540
Yes.

610
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:39,040
I want you to pay with your life.

611
00:39:58,220 --> 00:39:59,020
Lu Lingfeng,

612
00:39:59,340 --> 00:40:01,180
I'll help you one more time.

613
00:40:51,770 --> 00:40:52,520
Su Wuming.

614
00:40:55,530 --> 00:40:56,560
I lost.

615
00:40:57,140 --> 00:40:58,690
But you can't be rewarded.

616
00:41:02,210 --> 00:41:05,330
Because the daughter of Pei Jian must die.

617
00:41:06,730 --> 00:41:07,630
No.

618
00:41:31,970 --> 00:41:32,440
Xijun.

619
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:33,780
Xijun.

620
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:35,440
This...

621
00:41:41,650 --> 00:41:42,970
Don't panic, General.

622
00:41:43,310 --> 00:41:44,640
She's just in shock.

623
00:41:44,670 --> 00:41:45,630
She would be fine.

624
00:42:21,940 --> 00:42:23,250
Su Wuming, Sheriff of Chang'an.

625
00:42:23,470 --> 00:42:24,640
Greetings, Great General.

626
00:42:25,570 --> 00:42:26,180
Great General.

627
00:42:27,940 --> 00:42:28,520
Guards!

628
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:29,160
Here.

629
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:30,660
After checking the bodies,

630
00:42:30,970 --> 00:42:32,230
take all the alive

631
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:33,640
back for questioning.

632
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:40,370
Alive?

633
00:42:42,130 --> 00:42:43,130
Great General, you misunderstood.

634
00:42:43,940 --> 00:42:45,220
The criminals have been executed.

635
00:42:45,580 --> 00:42:46,430
General and I

636
00:42:46,460 --> 00:42:47,900
are here to investigate the case.

637
00:42:47,930 --> 00:42:49,280
-We... -Su Wuming, Sheriff of Chang'an.

638
00:42:50,180 --> 00:42:52,150
Lu Lingfeng, General of the Imperial Guards.

639
00:42:52,780 --> 00:42:53,610
Imprisoned into the Imperial Prison.

640
00:42:54,100 --> 00:42:54,640
Wait for trial.

641
00:42:54,810 --> 00:42:55,420
Yes.

642
00:43:18,790 --> 00:43:22,890
