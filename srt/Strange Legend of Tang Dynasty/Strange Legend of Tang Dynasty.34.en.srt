[Episode 34]

4
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:48,000
His signs his name Nanshan Salouzi.

5
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:50,700
I guess he is living in seclusion

6
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:53,009
in Zhongnan Mountain now.

7
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:54,700
But there are thousands of real and fake recluses

8
00:01:54,910 --> 00:01:56,920
in Zhongnan Mountain.

9
00:01:57,220 --> 00:01:58,420
How can we find

10
00:01:58,460 --> 00:01:59,300
this Salouzi?

11
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:05,100
I know what is the surname of

12
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:05,780
this Salouzi.

13
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:08,639
The five surnames and the seven families are ranked top

14
00:02:09,169 --> 00:02:11,590
among the noble families of Tang.

15
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:13,610
Except we Lu family of Fan Yang,

16
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:16,590
there are also Cui, Li, Zheng, and Wang.

17
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:19,760
But the Wang family of Taiyuan

18
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:21,790
is not as good as before,

19
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:25,160
so they were called the Salou Wang family.

20
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:28,870
Their power and wealth do not match their name.

21
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:32,120
Since the author used the pen name of Salouzi,

22
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:33,450
it indicates that

23
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,490
he might be from the Wang family of Taiyuan

24
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:37,160
and was mocking himself.

25
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:41,500
The Wang family of Taiyuan.

26
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:44,410
Great job, Lu Lingfeng.

27
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:47,370
You've just narrowed down the scope.

28
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:50,310
Since he's from the Wang family of Taiyuan,

29
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:52,010
and understand my master well.

30
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:54,880
At the same time, he was familiar with

31
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,380
the secret news of the Concubinus Institution.

32
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:00,400
I already know who he is.

33
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:03,240
But why is he hiding in

34
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:04,790
Zhongnan Mountain?

35
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:07,350
Even if he's there,

36
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:08,980
there are many recluses there.

37
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:10,220
How can you search for him?

38
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:11,340
How can you investigate?

39
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:13,590
It depends on

40
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:16,410
who's the one investigating it.

41
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:17,770
What?

42
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:20,250
Do you have any idea?

43
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:22,600
My family have a book

44
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:24,310
called the Book of Nanshan's Recluse.

45
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:26,220
It was written privately by my father.

46
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:27,340
He likes

47
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:28,670
to recommend talents to the imperial court.

48
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,700
So he took a lot of time

49
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:32,620
to visit those recluses in Zhongnan Mountain.

50
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:35,110
And he will update the content

51
00:03:35,490 --> 00:03:36,460
every two months.

52
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:38,350
I'll bring the book tomorrow.

53
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:39,530
No matter who you want to investigate,

54
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:41,110
you can find out

55
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:42,300
if you read that book.

[Book of Nanshan's Recluse]

57
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:55,340
What do you think?

58
00:03:56,329 --> 00:03:58,360
In order to write this Book of Nanshan's Recluse,

59
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:01,660
Assistant Minister Pei has put a lot of effort into it.

60
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:03,110
It contains

61
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:05,050
a total of 891 recluses,

62
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:07,820
and were arranged based on their surname.

63
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:10,000
Many people surnamed Wang,

64
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,330
but none of them matched with the other criteria.

65
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:14,030
Most importantly,

66
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:16,339
the person in my mind

67
00:04:16,459 --> 00:04:18,540
is not in this name list.

68
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:21,540
Was my analysis

69
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:23,230
yesterday wrong?

70
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:25,730
This Nanshan Salouzi

71
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:27,900
is not surnamed Wang.

72
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:30,150
Authors of this kind of books

73
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:33,150
like to use pen names and nicknames,

74
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:35,060
and they have some deep meaning.

75
00:04:35,659 --> 00:04:38,260
I think your analysis yesterday

76
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:39,260
makes sense.

77
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:43,300
The person who wrote the Tale of Sass must be surnamed Wang.

78
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:46,970
Nanshan Salouzi.

79
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:49,670
Would it be that the Nanshan here

80
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:51,740
is not Zhongnan Mountain,

81
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:53,740
but other Nanshan instead?

82
00:04:57,330 --> 00:04:58,490
There is another possibility.

83
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:00,860
The content written

84
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:02,140
in Assistant Minister Pei's book

85
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:04,370
is not detailed.

86
00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:07,210
It seems that the best way now

87
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,840
is to visit him myself.

88
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:11,460
Assistant Minister Pei?

89
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:14,540
Su Wuming.

90
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:15,590
Are you crazy?

91
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,050
Coming to the capital without permission

92
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,280
is already a serious crime.

93
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,130
Now you even want to visit Assistant Minister Pei.

94
00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:22,760
I think

95
00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:24,490
you're digging your own grave.

Lu Lingfeng,

99
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:34,830
you managed to kill Sass

100
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,720
after you took office.

101
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:38,260
You are very famous

102
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:40,140
in Chang'an now.

103
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,720
What can I do for you?

104
00:05:50,159 --> 00:05:51,520
This book was written by me,

105
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:52,830
why is it with you?

106
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:55,470
I've borrowed it from Miss Xijun

107
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:57,460
to look for clues yesterday.

108
00:05:57,890 --> 00:05:59,760
Assistant Minister has dedicated yourself

109
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:00,860
to search for talents for the Tang.

110
00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:03,050
The academic background of every recluse,

111
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:03,850
their hobbies,

112
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:04,510
and their temperament

113
00:06:04,850 --> 00:06:06,210
was recorded clearly in the book.

114
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:07,180
I really admire you,

115
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,660
Assistant Minister.

116
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:13,510
Minister Lu, you're flattering me.

117
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:18,180
I was looking for someone,

118
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:18,940
but I couldn't find him in the list.

119
00:06:20,170 --> 00:06:20,690
So,

120
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:23,450
I can only consult Assistant Minister Pei in person.

121
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:25,820
Who are you looking for?

122
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:29,520
I don't need to read the book,

123
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:31,100
it's all in my mind.

124
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:36,400
He used to work with Di Ren Jie,

125
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:39,220
and was familiar with

126
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:41,770
the Illusion Killer, Sass who used to

127
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:42,790
be the vice department chief of the Concubinus Institution.

128
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:46,950
This person should be surnamed Wang.

129
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:48,330
Assistant Minister Pei,

130
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:49,540
is there anyone like him?

131
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:50,520
Yes.

132
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:52,380
But he's not in the book.

133
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:54,540
He is different from other recluses.

134
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:56,540
Although he lives in Zhongnan Mountain,

135
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:57,600
he is still working

136
00:06:58,340 --> 00:06:59,690
as an official now.

137
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:02,540
Who?

138
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:05,590
Wang Yuantong.

139
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,760
He was the one I thought about last night.

140
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:13,500
Who is this Wang Yuantong?

141
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:16,300
When His Majesty was still the Premier,

142
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:19,980
he was once the Administrator of the Premier's Residence.

143
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:23,080
Later, he was promoted to the Assistant Minister of the Phoenix Pavilion

144
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:25,540
and acted as the Prime Minister.

145
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,790
Back then, he and my master were

146
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:30,250
against the establishment

147
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:31,740
of the Concubinus Institution by the Heavenly Empress.

148
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:34,400
The Heavenly Empress was cruel.

149
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:35,540
She didn’t kill him

150
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:37,670
nor demoted him to the other state.

151
00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:40,020
She just let him

152
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,640
to be the assistant chief of the Concubinus Institution.

153
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:45,480
Working for the Heavenly Empress’s concubinus,

154
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:49,850
the humiliation of the world

155
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:51,460
is nothing more than this.

156
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:53,140
Yes.

157
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:54,430
So later,

158
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:57,060
Wang Yuantong resigned and returned to his hometown.

159
00:07:57,820 --> 00:07:58,940
His hometown

160
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:01,030
is Shazhou, I think.

161
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:01,830
It's Shazhou.

162
00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:03,310
When he resigned,

163
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:05,210
my master was seriously ill.

164
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,610
Before he left Luoyang,

165
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:08,320
he even visited my teacher.

166
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:10,750
But now,

167
00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:12,610
why did he go to the Zhongnan Mountain?

168
00:08:13,570 --> 00:08:14,320
One year ago,

169
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:16,350
His Majesty

170
00:08:16,850 --> 00:08:18,270
suddenly remembered Wang Yuantong.

171
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:21,200
So His Majesty asked Assistant Minister Pei to go to Shazhou

172
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:22,490
to invite him back.

173
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:25,340
I think he missed the old days.

174
00:08:27,130 --> 00:08:29,090
But I didn't hear

175
00:08:29,790 --> 00:08:30,730
him getting any important position.

176
00:08:31,690 --> 00:08:32,600
What is his position now?

177
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:33,659
Just an unimportant job,

178
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:36,049
the Chief of the Department of Bamboo managing bamboos.

179
00:08:36,299 --> 00:08:37,580
The biggest bamboo forest

180
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:39,640
is in Zhongnan Mountain.

181
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:41,340
So Wang Yuantong has been

182
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:42,919
living there for a long time.

183
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:44,420
Everything is connected now.

184
00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:46,200
The Tale of Sass must be

185
00:08:46,330 --> 00:08:48,160
written by Wang Yuantong.

186
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:50,020
Lu Lingfeng,

187
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:51,960
come with me to Zhongnan Mountain.

188
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:54,580
Wait a minute.

189
00:08:55,490 --> 00:08:56,480
Xijun has drawn

190
00:08:56,510 --> 00:08:57,450
the portrait of Helan Xue.

191
00:08:58,060 --> 00:08:58,650
Let's take a look at it

192
00:08:58,790 --> 00:08:59,520
before doing anything.

193
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:05,380
Xijun,

194
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:06,840
you must have put in all your efforts

195
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:09,070
for this this painting.

196
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:11,580
It's so vivid.

197
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:12,740
Wait.

198
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:16,170
What is this?

199
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:18,670
A mole?

200
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:21,110
I've read

201
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:22,900
everything about Helan Xue's description

202
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:24,540
in the Tale of Sass,

203
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:27,220
but I didn't find that she has a mole.

204
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:28,970
That's because you did not

205
00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:30,130
read it carefully.

206
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:32,660
According to the book, she is the most beautiful

207
00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:33,570
when she cries.

208
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:35,200
A transparent tear

209
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:36,590
and a red tear

210
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:37,940
are on her face at the same time.

211
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:39,390
How would people

212
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:41,580
have read tears?

213
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,170
So I think

214
00:09:45,330 --> 00:09:46,730
Helan Xue should have a mole,

215
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:48,730
a red teardrop mole.

216
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,610
What was written in the book

217
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:52,580
was just a moment

218
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:53,790
where her tear crossed her teardrop mole.

219
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:56,250
I've read those lines

220
00:09:56,770 --> 00:09:58,120
several times,

221
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:00,000
and I was confused.

222
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:02,350
But I didn't expect

223
00:10:03,050 --> 00:10:04,810
it was a teardrop mole.

224
00:10:06,530 --> 00:10:08,830
My sister's wisdom

225
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:10,680
is really incomparable.

226
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:13,450
This woman does not

227
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,310
look young.

228
00:10:15,130 --> 00:10:18,450
She should be 35 or 36 years old.

229
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:19,300
Yes.

230
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:21,100
The content of the book

231
00:10:21,130 --> 00:10:22,290
was about the event 12 years ago.

232
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:23,540
Sass had

233
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:25,380
prepared a gift from Dongdu,

234
00:10:25,690 --> 00:10:26,650
and he rushed to Chang'an

235
00:10:26,890 --> 00:10:28,240
to celebrate her 24th birthday.

236
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:31,620
Everyone only knows Zhang Xuan,

237
00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:32,290
the painter of the painting of the Stone Bridge

238
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:33,860
as the best painter in the world.

239
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:35,380
In my opinion,

240
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:37,280
my sister is nothing less

241
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:38,640
compared to Zhang Xuan.

242
00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:40,540
She's way much better and

243
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:41,940
nothing less compared to him.

244
00:10:42,970 --> 00:10:43,430
Thank you.

245
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:47,190
Su Wu Ming.

246
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:48,380
Time is running out.

247
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:49,870
Go to Zhongnan Mountain

248
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:50,780
to find Wang Yuantong.

249
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:52,800
I'll go find Helan Xue.

250
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:54,460
We'll split up.

251
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:55,420
OK.

252
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:02,660
Xijun,

253
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:04,500
can you lend me

254
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:05,780
that beggar again?

255
00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:07,950
What can he help you with?

256
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:10,980
According to the book,

257
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:12,060
Helan Xue is

258
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:13,780
at the Cloud Tower in Pingkang Fang.

259
00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:15,060
That place...

260
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:16,940
I...

261
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:19,630
Have you never been to

262
00:11:19,650 --> 00:11:20,370
any brothel?

263
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:22,270
I don't believe it.

264
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:23,440
I've never been there.

265
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:28,710
Sir, come in.

266
00:11:30,050 --> 00:11:30,930
Come in and have a seat.

267
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:31,700
Come on.

268
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:34,780
Come in.

269
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:39,770
What are you doing?

270
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:41,860
This outfit

271
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:44,140
is not as comfortable as it was in the Assistant Minister's Residence.

272
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:46,970
You've only been there for a few days,

273
00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:48,900
and you can't get used to be a beggar anymore?

274
00:11:49,090 --> 00:11:50,060
I have a name.

275
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:51,270
What's your name?

276
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:52,380
Yang Ji.

277
00:11:55,050 --> 00:11:56,290
What did Pei Xijun tell you?

278
00:11:56,670 --> 00:11:57,520
How dare you

279
00:11:57,660 --> 00:11:58,540
make fun of me.

280
00:11:59,300 --> 00:11:59,660
No...

281
00:12:00,770 --> 00:12:01,330
No.

282
00:12:02,390 --> 00:12:02,710
My name

283
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:03,940
is Yang Ji.

284
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:06,300
Which two words?

285
00:12:06,930 --> 00:12:07,840
Yang of the Yang Tree,

286
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:10,630
Ji of the Jiangshan Sheji.

287
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:12,380
You can write?

288
00:12:12,930 --> 00:12:13,760
No, I can't.

289
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:14,660
Then how did

290
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:15,420
you say that?

291
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,190
When I was five,

292
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:20,410
my father told me that

293
00:12:21,170 --> 00:12:22,290
before he died.

294
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:25,590
Alright.

295
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:27,160
Stop crying.

296
00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:30,010
I've wronged you.

297
00:12:33,450 --> 00:12:34,580
Did you see that man?

298
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:36,270
-Come. -Sir.

299
00:12:36,290 --> 00:12:37,030
Please come in.

300
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:38,500
Give him this painting.

301
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:41,320
Tell him that the person on the painting is your mother,

302
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:43,220
and tell him to hand over your mother.

303
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:45,660
This...

304
00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:47,050
Don't worry.

305
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:48,500
If he dares to hit you,

306
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:49,840
just run back.

307
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:51,360
I'll take care of him.

308
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:52,580
Go.

309
00:12:52,610 --> 00:12:53,660
Please come in.

310
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:55,550
Sir, come here.

311
00:12:56,830 --> 00:12:57,710
Take care.

312
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:00,090
Take care of him.

313
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:00,590
Sir.

314
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:01,620
Sir.

315
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:04,650
Have you seen

316
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:05,440
the person in the painting?

317
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:08,750
Where did you get her portrait?

318
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:10,930
This is my mother.

319
00:13:11,130 --> 00:13:11,860
Let me ask you again.

320
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:12,790
Where did you get her portrait?

321
00:13:13,330 --> 00:13:14,540
This is my mother.

322
00:13:14,990 --> 00:13:15,630
Stinky beggar!

323
00:13:15,690 --> 00:13:16,290
How dare you fool me?

324
00:13:16,690 --> 00:13:17,170
You hit me!

325
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:17,700
Is this your mother?

326
00:13:17,810 --> 00:13:18,690
I'm your father.

327
00:13:18,690 --> 00:13:19,180
Someone is hitting me!

328
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,080
Stinky beggar! Come back!

329
00:13:21,690 --> 00:13:22,340
Stinky beggar!

330
00:13:24,650 --> 00:13:25,650
Let go of me!

331
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:26,790
Who do you think you are talking to?

332
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:28,410
Sir,

333
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,010
please forgive me.

334
00:13:30,450 --> 00:13:31,090
Please let me go.

335
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:32,060
Yang Ji.

336
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:32,700
Come here.

337
00:13:33,530 --> 00:13:34,410
Show him

338
00:13:34,930 --> 00:13:35,530
the portrait of your mum.

339
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:38,740
Do you know him?

340
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:39,840
No.

341
00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:41,420
It hurts.

342
00:13:42,010 --> 00:13:42,780
I know her.

343
00:13:42,930 --> 00:13:43,970
Her name is Helan Xue.

344
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:45,840
We call her Xue anyway.

345
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,680
Is she still in the Cloud Tower?

346
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:48,260
She has

347
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:49,860
left,

348
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:52,130
at least two or three years.

349
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:52,950
Where did she go?

350
00:13:53,610 --> 00:13:54,450
I don't know.

351
00:13:55,790 --> 00:13:57,060
I really don't know.

352
00:13:57,380 --> 00:13:58,300
Please spare my life.

353
00:13:58,340 --> 00:13:59,550
Did anyone redeem her?

354
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:00,780
No.

355
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:02,880
Are you sure?

356
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:03,560
Every year,

357
00:14:04,490 --> 00:14:05,890
they would be customers trying to redeem her.

358
00:14:05,930 --> 00:14:07,200
But she refused.

359
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:08,930
She seemed to be waiting for someone.

360
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:10,430
Later, she had nowhere to go.

361
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:11,100
So,

362
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:12,600
she went to that place.

363
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:13,260
Where?

364
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:15,870
The Resentment Tower in Ghost Market.

365
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:22,460
I've heard about

366
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,560
the Resentment Tower in the Ghost Market.

367
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:25,190
They are all old singers who

368
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:26,340
had no other choices.

369
00:14:27,310 --> 00:14:28,420
Although Helan Xue

370
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:29,370
is a bit old,

371
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:32,650
I don’t think she’s that old.

372
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,890
People from the Cloud Tower were very sure of it.

373
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:36,400
They also said that Xue

374
00:14:36,430 --> 00:14:37,510
refused to be redeemed.

375
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:39,070
She was waiting for someone.

376
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:40,950
Waiting for Sass?

377
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:43,250
I think so.

378
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:49,900
Call your men to go to the Ghost Market with me.

379
00:14:52,810 --> 00:14:53,330
What's wrong?

380
00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:55,110
When we were investigating the Chang'an black tea case,

381
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:56,600
didn't Wu and the others

382
00:14:56,670 --> 00:14:57,380
died in the Ghost Market?

383
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:01,070
Later, General has publicly prohibited

384
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:02,060
Imperial Guards to enter the Ghost Market.

385
00:15:02,430 --> 00:15:02,870
That's why.

386
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,280
But I can go with you.

387
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:07,170
It's just that I don't want to

388
00:15:07,170 --> 00:15:07,920
involve other brothers.

389
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:11,440
Forget it.

390
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,020
I am now the Minister of Justice of Yongzhou,

391
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:15,960
I shouldn't order the Imperial Guards around.

392
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:18,990
[Administrator's Residence]

393
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:26,730
Administrator Du.

394
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:31,020
You came at the right time.

395
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:34,720
The magic show is coming soon.

396
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,810
As the Minister of Justice,

397
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,250
don't you know

398
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:39,500
what to do?

399
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:40,530
By then,

400
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:42,340
His Majesty will be enjoying the joy with the people.

401
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:44,660
But we can't have all the people in Chang'an

402
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:45,940
entering the Sky-scraping Tower.

403
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:48,210
We have to

404
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,460
filter the candidates.

405
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:51,160
This is your job.

406
00:15:52,490 --> 00:15:53,630
Since the real Sass

407
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:54,370
has not been caught,

408
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:56,160
then arresting him

409
00:15:56,610 --> 00:15:57,760
is my main duty.

410
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:03,460
Minister Lu,

411
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:04,850
you're just choosing

412
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,200
those jobs which can build your own career.

413
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:07,120
Fine.

414
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:09,700
I'll do

415
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:12,290
I'll do it for you.

416
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:13,220
However,

417
00:16:13,810 --> 00:16:14,610
from now on,

418
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:16,510
I will take over

419
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:18,870
your men.

420
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:22,380
I need some extra hands now.

421
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:24,010
I just got

422
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:25,240
a new clue about Sass today.

423
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:25,860
I...

424
00:16:26,190 --> 00:16:27,030
Don't tell me anything

425
00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:28,130
about the investigation.

426
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:31,350
Once you tell me your clues,

427
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:32,610
who will be rewarded

428
00:16:32,890 --> 00:16:34,300
if we arrest Sass.

429
00:16:44,730 --> 00:16:46,120
New clue.

430
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:49,830
It has been 12 years.

431
00:16:50,490 --> 00:16:51,370
I don't believe that

432
00:16:52,310 --> 00:16:54,860
you can arrest Sass before me.

433
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:19,170
-General. -Isn’t this…

434
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:20,619
Greetings, General.

435
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:23,000
No, he's now the Minister of Justice.

436
00:17:23,030 --> 00:17:23,520
Yes.

437
00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:24,690
He just killed the Sass,

438
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:25,319
have you forgotten?

439
00:17:25,569 --> 00:17:26,180
Yes.

440
00:17:26,550 --> 00:17:27,599
Greetings, Minister Lu.

441
00:17:29,330 --> 00:17:30,770
Greetings, my three brothers.

442
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:32,200
What brings you here

443
00:17:32,450 --> 00:17:33,370
to Chang'an County?

444
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,560
I'm here

445
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:37,370
to seek for your help

446
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:38,980
for some investigation.

447
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:39,740
This...

448
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:40,340
This...

449
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:41,070
Investigation?

450
00:17:41,410 --> 00:17:42,450
Before returning to Chang'an,

451
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:43,870
Su Wuming has reminded me

452
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:45,390
that in Chang'an County,

453
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:47,010
you, Jia,

454
00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:47,720
you, Luo,

455
00:17:48,050 --> 00:17:48,910
and you, Liu,

456
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:50,260
are brave and astute,

457
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:51,500
and capable to bear big responsibility.

458
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:52,700
What?

459
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:54,310
You don't want to help me?

460
00:17:54,970 --> 00:17:55,450
Help?

461
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,490
How could you mention the word "help"?

462
00:17:58,020 --> 00:17:58,460
Yes.

463
00:17:58,740 --> 00:17:59,660
You are now

464
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:00,500
the Minister of Justice of Yongzhou,

465
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:01,740
we are all under your control.

466
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:02,460
Yes.

467
00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:04,040
To be honest,

468
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:04,910
the three of us were

469
00:18:04,930 --> 00:18:05,650
complaining about it just now.

470
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:08,780
It's boring to patrol the streets every day.

471
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:10,460
During the Hungry Ghost Festival last year,

472
00:18:10,530 --> 00:18:11,540
we were following Sheriff Su

473
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:12,130
and you

474
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,140
fighting at the Ghost Market.

475
00:18:13,170 --> 00:18:14,190
That was really fun,

476
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:15,220
was the best days of my life.

477
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:16,100
Great.

478
00:18:16,610 --> 00:18:17,890
It's still the Ghost Market again.

479
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:19,200
Besides,

480
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:21,620
you might get to meet

481
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:23,210
some beauties.

482
00:18:24,090 --> 00:18:24,530
Beau...

483
00:18:25,150 --> 00:18:25,710
Beauties?

484
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:31,760
Minister Lu

485
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:34,180
is indeed the Crown Prince's man,

486
00:18:34,910 --> 00:18:37,010
he's so generous.

487
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:39,270
[Resentment Tower]

488
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:37,980
He even let us

489
00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:39,720
spend in this Resentment Tower.

490
00:18:40,130 --> 00:18:41,130
I never had this treatment

491
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:43,080
in my life.

492
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:44,670
But I'm wondering

493
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:45,910
if the women here

494
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:47,440
are better than those in Pingkang Fang.

495
00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:49,470
We have money, what are you afraid of?

496
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,110
Just pick the best one.

497
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:36,020
Mine.

498
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:36,700
Mine.

499
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:45,900
This is really not a good job.

500
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:50,780
Let's get down to business.

501
00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:52,980
Xue,

502
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:54,360
is indeed in the Resentment Tower.

503
00:19:54,730 --> 00:19:55,690
But ordinary people can't see her.

504
00:19:56,110 --> 00:19:56,880
Doesn't she serve guests?

505
00:19:57,340 --> 00:19:58,300
I heard she's very arrogant.

506
00:19:58,740 --> 00:19:59,450
We can only see her

507
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:00,360
by giving her gold.

508
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:01,900
But think about it,

509
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:03,140
those who came for the women in the Ghost Market,

510
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:04,680
who would give up gold?

511
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:06,500
I think that's crazy.

512
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,270
She always said someone would pick her up.

513
00:20:08,610 --> 00:20:09,820
But after two years,

514
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,280
no one came.

515
00:20:11,870 --> 00:20:12,970
But she must have some money,

516
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:14,420
as she lives in

517
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:15,300
the biggest room in the Resentment Tower alone.

518
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:16,050
If she had no money,

519
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:17,860
she would have been driven away by the shopkeeper.

520
00:20:18,410 --> 00:20:19,180
And...

521
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:21,660

for 12 years.

655

to buy the Resentment Tower in the Ghost Market.

657
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:18,850
Now,

658
00:28:19,610 --> 00:28:21,220
if our great merit was stolen

659
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:22,060
by others...

660
00:28:22,410 --> 00:28:23,060
Don't worry.

Even if he finds Helan Xue,

662

it's useless.

If anyone can catch Sass,

664
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:37,940
will Detective Di

to me back then?

667
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:43,900
I think

668
00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:48,030
Sass will take Helan Xue away

669
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:49,140
before the Magic Show.

670
00:28:53,450 --> 00:28:54,210
It's only a few days away.

671
00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:56,100
Keep a good eye on her.

672

You all couldn't find a lover

tonight,

685
00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:33,360
you all have to find someone

686
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:35,380
and stay there for a long time!

687
00:29:35,730 --> 00:29:36,730
At least until the Mid-Autumn Festival.

696
00:29:54,270 --> 00:29:55,100
It's too hard.

You can wear the one from the Assistant Minister's Residence.

706
00:30:28,690 --> 00:30:29,280
That much?

707
00:30:30,410 --> 00:30:31,050
The dumplings won't cost this much money.

708
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:32,280
Keep it for now.

709
00:30:32,470 --> 00:30:33,560
We need to buy something else tomorrow.

No.

No.

yet you're keeping the singing girls

there would be no Xie Anshi in this world.

So, why not?

805
00:35:24,970 --> 00:35:26,800
So you're following Xie Anshi's example of

806
00:35:27,390 --> 00:35:28,750
living in seclusion in the East Mountain and not taking an official position.

Since you're the Administrator of Luozhou,

00:35:46,810 --> 00:35:48,180
why do you come to Chang'an

813

I'm here for Sass.

815
00:35:55,670 --> 00:35:57,160
Back then in Luoyang,

816
00:35:57,610 --> 00:35:59,770
the Sass case was the last case

817
00:35:59,910 --> 00:36:01,110
my teacher investigated.

818
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:03,620
But the result didn't go as he wished.

819
00:36:03,970 --> 00:36:05,980
Sass escaped from Luoyang,

820
00:36:06,270 --> 00:36:09,480
and 12 years have passed since then.

821
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:11,250
I heard that

822
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:13,100
the Magic Show in the Sky-scraping Tower

823
00:36:13,620 --> 00:36:14,780
is about to begin.

824
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:18,670
And Sass took the chance to sneak into Chang'an.

825
00:36:19,180 --> 00:36:21,620
So I came from Dongdu

826
00:36:21,620 --> 00:36:23,210
to catch him

827
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:26,080
so as to make up

828
00:36:26,470 --> 00:36:28,150
for my teacher's deathbed regret.

829
00:36:28,730 --> 00:36:30,050
I've heard about

830
00:36:30,450 --> 00:36:32,240
about the case of Sass.

831
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:35,960
But what can I do

832
00:36:36,770 --> 00:36:38,350
to help you this time?

833
00:36:39,890 --> 00:36:41,000
There's a book

834
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:44,140
called Tale of Sass.

835
00:36:45,340 --> 00:36:47,490
This is how the book ends.

836
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:49,780
In 700,

837
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:52,460
Salouzi became an official in Luoyang.

838
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:54,710
He liked the banquets at the Long Gate

839
00:36:54,930 --> 00:36:58,550
and enjoyed looking far from the Tianjin Bridge.

840
00:36:59,020 --> 00:37:02,030
So people wrote it down.

841
00:37:02,730 --> 00:37:05,090
However, there were many other things about Sass.

842
00:37:06,220 --> 00:37:08,940
In this book, only a small part is recorded.

843
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:11,820
It must be the limited space of the book.

844
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:14,040
There were many things about Sass

845
00:37:15,570 --> 00:37:18,770
you didn't write about in the book.

846
00:37:18,790 --> 00:37:20,960
So I came here to ask you

847
00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:23,140
to find clues.

848
00:37:46,590 --> 00:37:47,910
Who told you

849
00:37:48,490 --> 00:37:50,580
I'm the one who wrote the Tale of Sass?

850
00:37:51,810 --> 00:37:53,490
The book has appeared in Chang'an

851
00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:55,220
half a year ago.

852
00:37:55,850 --> 00:37:57,110
As far as I know,

853
00:37:57,460 --> 00:38:00,170
you returned to Chang'an a year ago.

854
00:38:00,790 --> 00:38:03,220
The time matches.

855
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:06,240
Besides, what's written in the book...

856
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:07,680
For example,

857
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:09,920
when my teacher was seriously ill,

858
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,900
there was a Bichen Pearl in front of his bed.

859
00:38:13,510 --> 00:38:14,220
Only those

860
00:38:14,630 --> 00:38:16,660
who visited him

861
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:17,700
would know.

862
00:38:19,050 --> 00:38:21,160
Do you remember?

863
00:38:22,090 --> 00:38:23,450
When you resigned

864
00:38:23,470 --> 00:38:24,960
and before you left Luoyang,

865
00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:27,390
you visited my teacher,

866
00:38:27,740 --> 00:38:30,700
and I happened to be there.

867
00:38:31,470 --> 00:38:32,700
Besides,

868
00:38:33,050 --> 00:38:34,890
you were the assistant chief of the Concubinus Institution.

869
00:38:35,930 --> 00:38:37,500
So you must know many secret tales

870
00:38:37,530 --> 00:38:38,850
and many details

871
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:41,180
about the Concubinus Institution.

872
00:38:41,730 --> 00:38:42,370
Also,

873
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:45,850
the author's pen name is Nanshan Salouzi.

874
00:38:46,670 --> 00:38:50,510
Salou is related to the Wang family of Taiyuan.

875
00:38:51,090 --> 00:38:53,970
Now you are the Department Chief of the Bamboo

876
00:38:54,140 --> 00:38:56,470
and living partially in seclusion in the Zhongnan Mountain.

877
00:38:56,860 --> 00:38:59,010
In the world,

878
00:38:59,030 --> 00:38:59,870
you are the only one

879
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:01,980
who meets the requirements.

880
00:39:06,170 --> 00:39:08,010
You are indeed Di Renjie's disciple.

881
00:39:08,990 --> 00:39:10,780
Back then, I opposed the Heavenly Empress

882
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:11,880
for establishing the Concubinus Institution.

883
00:39:12,410 --> 00:39:14,140
But I was demoted as the assistant chief of the Concubinus Institution.

884
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:15,700
I worked under Zhang Yizhi,

885
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:17,720
Empress Wu Zetian's concubinus.

886
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:19,740
This is the greatest humiliation in my life

887
00:39:19,930 --> 00:39:21,690
that can't be undone.

888
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:23,270
In 698,

889
00:39:23,420 --> 00:39:25,740
Zhang Yizhi recommended Sass as the Vice Department Chief

890
00:39:25,850 --> 00:39:27,850
and set up a mansion in the Magic House

891
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:31,000
to gather all the enchanters

892
00:39:31,460 --> 00:39:33,660
to eliminate dissidents through Sass.

893
00:39:34,450 --> 00:39:35,190
Another year had passed

894
00:39:35,220 --> 00:39:36,740
and it was the 700.

895
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:38,020
With your teacher, Di Renjie's

896
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:39,650
strong remonstration,

897
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:41,930
Heavenly Empress was forced to change the Concubinus Institution

898
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:43,440
to Fengchen Institution.

899
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:47,390
Di Renjie also found out about

900
00:39:47,420 --> 00:39:49,420
Sass as the Illusion Killer.

901
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:52,640
The evidence of all the crimes he committed was solid.

902
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:55,640
A lot of Sass's pawns were arrested,

903
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:57,720
but only he escaped.

904
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:00,800
Di Renjie thought this was the biggest regret

905
00:40:00,820 --> 00:40:02,110
in his life.

906
00:40:02,430 --> 00:40:04,590
But I think it is nothing.

907
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:06,960
Detective Di is not a god after all.

908
00:40:07,540 --> 00:40:09,750
To me,

909
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:12,240
writing the Tale of Sass,

910
00:40:12,940 --> 00:40:14,910
is to kill time.

911
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:19,090
That "only a small part is recorded" in the book

912
00:40:20,150 --> 00:40:21,510
is just keeping you in suspense.

913
00:40:22,750 --> 00:40:24,210
I always look down on

914
00:40:24,230 --> 00:40:25,190
people like Sass.

915
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:27,790
How can I know much about him?

916
00:40:29,180 --> 00:40:30,160
So,

917
00:40:30,370 --> 00:40:32,930
I don't have any clues for you.

918
00:40:34,740 --> 00:40:35,320
Well...

919
00:40:36,790 --> 00:40:38,890
That Helan Xue

920
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:40,330
who can play the pipa reversely...

921
00:40:42,890 --> 00:40:43,970
What's in my book about her

922
00:40:44,420 --> 00:40:46,220
is all just hearsay.

923
00:40:47,450 --> 00:40:48,740
Come on, let's drink.

924
00:40:48,990 --> 00:40:49,750
Otherwise,

925
00:40:49,870 --> 00:40:52,480
your trip to Zhongnan Mountain will be in vain.

926
00:40:53,910 --> 00:40:55,380
How would this trip be in vain?

927
00:40:55,930 --> 00:40:58,700
I've visited my teacher's old friend

928
00:40:59,390 --> 00:41:01,900
and have such good wine.

929
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:04,450
It's already worth the trip.

930
00:41:04,780 --> 00:41:05,900
Here's to you.

931
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:11,710
So good.

932
00:41:13,860 --> 00:41:14,160
Sir,

933
00:41:14,620 --> 00:41:15,600
two catties of camel hump.

934
00:41:16,060 --> 00:41:17,060
Make sure it's roasted well.

935
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:17,600
Okay.

936
00:42:40,220 --> 00:42:41,750
What's for today?

937
00:42:43,070 --> 00:42:43,900
Roasted Camel Hump.

938
00:42:44,830 --> 00:42:46,350
Unfortunately, I was delayed on the way.

939
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:48,080
I think it's cold.

940
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:49,520
It doesn't matter.

941
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:52,090
I have hot wine.

942
00:42:52,690 --> 00:42:53,500
I am fine with the cold meat.

943
00:42:54,570 --> 00:42:55,090
Kid,

944
00:42:55,370 --> 00:42:56,030
do you want to come in

945
00:42:56,060 --> 00:42:57,180
and have a drink with me?

946
00:42:58,570 --> 00:42:59,450
I can't drink!

947
00:43:13,670 --> 00:43:17,770
♫The storm rises with no reason♫
