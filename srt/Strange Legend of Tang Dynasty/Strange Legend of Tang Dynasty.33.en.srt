4
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:46,380
If the Crown Prince ascends the throne,

5
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:48,580
as your people,

6
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,680
I will be expelled from the capital

7
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:52,420
and transferred to somewhere remote and barren.

8
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:55,890
Or worse. I may die a miserable death.

9
00:01:57,340 --> 00:01:59,270
You were raised

10
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:00,420
by your uncle, right?

11
00:02:04,570 --> 00:02:05,860
Y-Yes.

12
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,740
Years ago, Queen Wei poisoned her husband,

13
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:15,280
Emperor Gongzong.

14
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,190
The Crown Prince and I joined forces

15
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:20,400
and annihilated her and her adherents.

16
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:22,030
Your uncle

17
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:24,670
died on the night of the siege.

18
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,030
I'm forever indebted to you

19
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:29,270
for considering me innocent that time.

20
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:30,040
Your Highness,

21
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:31,990
I would risk my life to repay you.

22
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,960
That's not what I meant.

23
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:35,620
I mean

24
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:38,150
you are so hellbent on persuading me

25
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:39,890
to take advantage of the magic show

26
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:42,780
to do away with the Crown Prince.

27
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:43,940
Is it because that

28
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:46,280
you intend to seek revenge?

29
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:55,050
I heard that

30
00:02:55,130 --> 00:02:57,410
your uncle didn't surrender that night

31
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:00,430
and the Crown Prince had to kill him himself.

32
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:01,690
Your Highness,

33
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:03,620
I advised you to take down the Crown Prince

34
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:05,460
not for the sake of my own interests.

35
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:06,460
I'm worried

36
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:07,890
that once he becomes powerful enough,

37
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,930
your life will be in danger.

38
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:21,170
Look at you. So scared.

39
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:22,520
Get up.

40
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:25,960
If I didn't trust you,

41
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:27,670
I wouldn't have kept you

42
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:29,160
by my side for so long.

43
00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:31,780
You have a kind heart, Your Highness.

44
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:34,780
You remind me of how Heavenly Empress treated Di Renjie.

45
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,570
You're comparing yourself to Detective Di?

46
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:42,420
I'm definitely not in his league,

47
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:44,680
but please believe that my loyalty to you

48
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:45,660
won't alter no matter what happens.

49
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:48,010
You're right.

50
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:50,190
I put loyalty

51
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:52,760
before talent.

52
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,570
I can't make you

53
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,570
the Minister of Justice of Yongzhou,

54
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:57,770
but

55
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:00,200
there is an even higher position

56
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,080
waiting for you.

57
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:03,640
Tomorrow is the seventh of August,

58
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:05,400
the day when you and Sass have agreed to meet up.

59
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:06,740
Bring enough money with you.

60
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:08,170
Tell him

61
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:09,770
that after it's done,

62
00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:11,830
he will be given even more rewards,

63
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,280
and I can help him to rebuild his career.

64
00:04:15,770 --> 00:04:17,390
He was once

65
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:19,070
the deputy supervisor of the Concubinus Institution.

66
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:20,920
After I ascend the throne,

67
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:23,820
there may be a chance

68
00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:25,970
that it'll be restored.

69
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:30,040
Understood, Your Highness.

70
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:32,080
I'll wait for that day to come.

71
00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:34,770
You may leave.

72
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:36,330
Yes.

[Official Certificate]

74
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:57,860
Minister Lu,

75
00:04:58,330 --> 00:04:59,810
you are given the post at a perilous moment.

76
00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:01,430
Arrest Sass

77
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:02,640
and make sure everything runs smoothly

78
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:03,950
during the magic show on the Mid-Autumn Festival.

79
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:06,200
You have to shoulder the burden of that now.

80
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:07,300
Rest assured.

81
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:08,800
I will spare no effort.

82
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:09,990
Thank you for your trust, Assistant Minister Pei.

83
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:11,090
Alright.

84
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:13,700

85

-Nice to meet you. -Arresting Sass

87

is without doubt

88
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:20,260
a tough task.

89
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:24,170
Wan An died because he was too desperately

90
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:25,630
seeking after merits.

91
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,640
Don't repeat his tragedy.

92

You may leave.

93
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:32,440
I need to have a word

94
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:33,520
with Assistant Minister Pei.

95
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:40,310
Yes.

96
00:05:47,159 --> 00:05:47,950
Assistant Minister Pei,

97
00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:49,600
I asked you to find me someone capable.

98
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,330
That's what you gave me?

99
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:54,900
Both the Princess and the Crown Prince

100
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:55,950
recommended him.

101
00:05:57,050 --> 00:05:58,880
What's wrong with him?

102
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:03,550
Fortunately,

103
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:04,860
I was once a Minister of Justice myself.

104
00:06:05,290 --> 00:06:06,530
Guess I'm on my own.

105
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:08,800
What do you mean?

106
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:11,030
It's true that Lu Lingfeng made some mistakes,

107
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:13,710
but after he went south with Su Wuming,

108
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:15,050
whether he was in Nanzhou

109
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:16,050
or Ninghu,

110
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:17,820
especially in Luoyang,

111
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:19,470
he proved himself for being capable

112
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,750
and made great achievements.

113
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:21,410
Otherwise,

114
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:23,340
the Princess wouldn't have put in a good word for him.

115
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:25,310
Neither would the Crown Prince.

116
00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:30,230
I don't know politics,

117
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:33,600
but I'm sure that we can't

118
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:34,900
count on someone like that

119
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:36,340
to bring the criminal to justice.

120
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:49,780
Look.

121
00:06:51,890 --> 00:06:52,530
There are so many.

122
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:53,010
Yeah.

123
00:06:53,409 --> 00:06:54,740
Are you Minister Lu?

124
00:06:55,150 --> 00:06:55,590
Yes.

125
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,450
Someone asked me to give you this.

126
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:03,990
To catch Sass,

127
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:05,250
[To catch Sass, come to the Sky-scraping Tower.]

128
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:05,640
come to the Sky-scraping Tower.

129
00:07:30,730 --> 00:07:31,790
Are you Minister Lu?

130
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:33,860
Yes.

131
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:35,100
This way please.

132
00:07:48,409 --> 00:07:49,409
Your Highness, I didn't know you were here.

133
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,280
Sorry for disturbing you.

134
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:54,680
I sent that massage to you.

135
00:07:55,170 --> 00:07:56,280
You're not disturbing me.

136
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:58,090
I-I beg your pardon?

137
00:07:58,300 --> 00:07:59,090
Those words

138
00:07:59,130 --> 00:08:00,510
didn't look like my handwriting?

139
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:02,800
That's not what I meant.

140
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:05,800
The Crown Prince and I recommended you

141
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:07,060
to be the Minister of Justice.

142
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:09,300
You should thank me.

143
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:18,470
Thank you, Your Highness.

144
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:23,890
Actually, it's a dangerous position.

145
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,110
If the Eastern Palace hadn't proposed your name,

146
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:27,980
I wouldn't have thought of you.

147
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:31,740
Tell me.

148
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:37,350
Do you have any clues to capture Sass?

149
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:41,780
By now,

150
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:44,330
no.

151
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:47,080
Then pay close attention to one person.

152
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:50,490
Wei Fenghua, a guy working for me.

153
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:52,770
Regimental Commander Wei?

154
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:55,210
Tomorrow is the seventh of August.

155
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:56,850
Keep track of him.

156
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:59,500
You may win a great triumph tomorrow.

157
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:02,060
By then, just do what needs to be done.

158
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:04,150
Don't hold back because he's my subordinate.

159
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,920
Enough serious talk.

160
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:09,410
Come.

161
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:11,340
Enjoy the beautiful view

162
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:12,710
of Chang'an with me.

163
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:29,580
This floor is called Beyond Heaven.

164
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:32,810
Not everyone can come up here.

165
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:37,120
How beautiful is Chang'an!

166
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:40,850
Long Live the great Tang!

167
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:06,590
Who's there?

168
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:07,250
Sir,

169
00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:08,650
I'm the waiter.

170
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:16,550
You are waiting for someone, right?

171
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:17,740
A guest told me

172
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:18,680
to send you this letter.

173
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:21,720
Got it.

174
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:22,750
You may leave.

00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:33,080
[The bamboo forest in the western suburbs]

176
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:34,410
The bamboo forest in the western suburbs?

177
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:05,520
You're indeed a great magician, Sass.

178
00:11:07,770 --> 00:11:09,490
You're not ordinary either.

179
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:10,680
Those silver ingots

180
00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:11,620
are the deposit.

181
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,120
I'll pay you gold after you make it.

182
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,300
I feel humiliated.

183
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:17,790
They're not enough?

184
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,810
As capable as I am,

185
00:11:20,490 --> 00:11:21,420
I can get as much gold and silver

186
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:22,970
as I would.

187
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:24,110
Besides,

188
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:26,870
if money is all I want for killing the Crown Prince,

189
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:29,410
doesn't it make me a bandit?

190
00:11:30,010 --> 00:11:31,370
What do you want?

191
00:11:32,130 --> 00:11:33,140
That day, you said

192
00:11:33,730 --> 00:11:34,720
you can give me

193
00:11:35,170 --> 00:11:36,460
whatever I want.

194
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:37,150
Yeah.

195
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:38,460
Okay.

196
00:11:40,010 --> 00:11:41,320
I want to be

197
00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:44,970
the Prime Minister.

198
00:11:53,450 --> 00:11:54,050
What do you think?

199
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,270
You can't give me that, right?

200
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:02,130
If you didn't have

201
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:04,410
the guts to ask for that,

202
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:07,310
I would suspect that you're not Sass.

203
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,790
The Prime Minister

204
00:12:11,810 --> 00:12:13,330
can be you.

205
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:15,310
So,

206
00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:18,050
the person who wants to hire me is the Princess.

207
00:12:18,290 --> 00:12:19,450
Feel free to guess,

208
00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:21,280
but I can't tell you.

209
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:22,970
How can I get what you promised?

210
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:24,390
When it's done,

211
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:25,580
I will go to you.

212
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:26,420
Of course,

213
00:12:26,890 --> 00:12:28,090
it's not difficult for you to find me.

214
00:12:32,450 --> 00:12:34,970
I am Wei Fenghua.

215
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:38,550
OK.

216
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:40,270
I will see you

217
00:12:40,730 --> 00:12:42,610
as my friend.

218
00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:51,870
You didn't come alone?

219
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:52,470
I did!

220
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,090
Minister Lu, it's him.

221
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:01,840
Sass.

222
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:03,050
He killed Minister Wan.

223
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,440
Lu Lingfeng!

224
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:06,590
Take him down.

225
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:25,460
Bow!

226
00:13:59,140 --> 00:13:59,840
Don't be afraid!

227
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:00,850
It's just an illusion.

228
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:02,880
A beguiling trick is all it is.

229
00:14:21,810 --> 00:14:22,770
No!

230
00:14:35,830 --> 00:14:36,240
You...

231
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:39,000
You're too reckless.

232
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:40,950
He's dangerous

233
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:43,070
and may play more tricks on you.

234
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:51,760
Wei Fenghua,

235
00:14:52,490 --> 00:14:53,480
no one can save you now.

236
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:55,110
Just surrender.

237
00:14:55,570 --> 00:14:56,650
Who's behind you?

238
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:57,740
Tell me!

239
00:14:58,150 --> 00:15:00,570
I can't hate the Crown Prince more.

240
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:03,840
I planned to use Sass

241
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:05,570
to avenge my uncle.

242
00:15:06,270 --> 00:15:08,410
No one is behind me.

243
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:10,900
Surrender?

244
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:13,500
No way.

245
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:30,100
What?

246
00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:33,340
You've killed Sass?

247
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:44,750
Lu Lingfeng.

248
00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:48,210
You're so eager to be the hero

249
00:15:48,370 --> 00:15:50,130
that you put on a show to fool me, aren't you?

250
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:50,980
Administrator Du,

251
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:54,350
the constables working with me

252
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:55,610
are all witnesses.

253
00:15:55,990 --> 00:15:57,310
Minister Wan was killed

254
00:15:57,330 --> 00:15:58,060
by that man.

255
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:02,040
Don't say something like that again.

256
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:05,140
Sorry, I forgot

257
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:08,340
that you were appointed

258
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:09,560
by both the Crown Prince and the Princess.

259
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:12,880
I can't afford to offend you.

260
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:16,180
Let's go

261
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:17,630
and see the man you killed.

262
00:16:33,530 --> 00:16:34,870
It's really Sass.

263
00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:37,070
Although I haven't seen him for more than a decade,

264
00:16:37,370 --> 00:16:38,130
I still remember

265
00:16:39,630 --> 00:16:40,470
what he looked like.

266
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:46,750
Congratulations, Minister Lu.

267
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:48,980
You won such a big victory

268
00:16:49,170 --> 00:16:50,590
soon after you was appointed the Minister of Justice.

269
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,110
Your promotion is on the way.

270
00:17:14,810 --> 00:17:15,950
This man doesn't

271
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:17,430
look like

272
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:18,890
the Sass I met years ago.

273
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:24,450
It's him!

274
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:25,270
It's him.

275
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:25,790
Sass.

276
00:17:26,130 --> 00:17:26,660
Sass!

277
00:17:27,089 --> 00:17:28,930
He was the deputy supervisor of the Concubinus Institution.

278
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:30,990
I could recognize him even if he turned into ashes.

279
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:40,520
Little beggar.

280
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:42,080
Why are you here?

281
00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:44,710
Miss Pei has finished the painting.

282
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:46,370
I came to send it to you.

283
00:17:54,530 --> 00:17:55,570
This is not a portrait.

284
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:59,260
Miss Pei drew a portrait at first, but it had little resemblance

285
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:01,660
to the man I saw no matter how she polished it.

286
00:18:02,450 --> 00:18:04,140
So she drew this at last

287
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:06,280
and it was accurate.

288
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:08,460
This is exactly what I saw

289
00:18:08,490 --> 00:18:09,440
that night.

290
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:11,260
Exactly the same.

291
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:15,800
You saw this?

292
00:18:16,310 --> 00:18:17,420
Yes.

293
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:22,200
This man was terrified

294
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:26,580
and was looking up at the sky?

295
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:28,230
Yes.

296
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,450
May I know

297
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:53,840
who's blocking my way?

298
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:56,090
I'm willing to leave some money.

299
00:18:56,370 --> 00:18:58,080
Please let me pass.

300
00:18:59,210 --> 00:19:00,490
No one wants your money.

301
00:19:01,190 --> 00:19:02,030
I want your life.

302
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:06,820
I told you not to follow me.

303
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:08,610
I've been following you for four days.

304
00:19:09,330 --> 00:19:10,170
If I didn't stop you,

305
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:11,770
you'd soon reach Chang'an.

306
00:19:11,830 --> 00:19:13,160
It's not convenient

307
00:19:13,190 --> 00:19:15,030
to bring you with me to Chang'an this time.

308
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:15,780
I understand.

309
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:17,300
You are an official of Luoyang.

310
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:19,500
Entering Chang'an without permission

311
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:21,070
will cost you your life.

312
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:23,080
You know that but you followed me anyway?

313
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:25,040
I followed you

314
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:25,990
because I knew you might be in danger.

315
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:27,920
You were in danger so many times before

316
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:29,510
and I saved you again and again.

317
00:19:30,310 --> 00:19:32,400
I was never a burden to you.

318
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:34,250
This time is different.

319
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:36,180
Chang'an is the capital.

320
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:38,120
The two of us

321
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:39,930
may arouse suspicion easily.

322
00:19:40,890 --> 00:19:41,530
Bullshit.

323
00:19:42,210 --> 00:19:42,870
You traveling alone

324
00:19:42,990 --> 00:19:44,220
is much more suspicious.

325
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:48,300
If we disguise as husband and wife,

326
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:50,260
we can be safer.

327
00:19:53,690 --> 00:19:54,210
What?

328
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,000
You're shy?

329
00:19:57,260 --> 00:19:58,690
We'll enter the city in two hours.

330
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:00,580
Get changed.

331
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:01,940
Your outfit

332
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:03,210
is too eye-catching.

333
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:08,650
That guy called Sass

334
00:20:08,690 --> 00:20:09,840
has really returned to Chang'an?

335
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:11,600
If you can catch him,

336
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:13,690
you'll prove yourself abler than your master.

337
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:17,060
That's crap.

338
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:19,240
You're competent anyway.

339
00:20:19,850 --> 00:20:20,690
Tell me your plan.

340
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:24,100
We need to find a book first.

341
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:29,420
[Notice]

342
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:26,950
Sass of Tokhara

343
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:28,770
was a powerful magician

344
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,690
but an unfaithful subject.

345
00:20:31,010 --> 00:20:32,920
He deceived the Heavenly Empress

346
00:20:33,050 --> 00:20:34,060
and committed crimes in Luoyang.

347
00:20:34,690 --> 00:20:36,990
He sneaked into the capital a while ago

348
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:38,490
and attempted to do evil deeds again.

349
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:42,020
The new Minister of Justice of Yongzhou,

350
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:43,290
Lu Lingfeng,

351
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:44,990
is vigilant and brave.

352
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,710
He found Sass and killed him effortlessly.

353
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:49,970
The outlaw has been brought to justice.

354
00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:51,310
Sass was killed by Lu Lingfeng.

355
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:52,800
We can go back now.

356
00:20:53,010 --> 00:20:53,840
No death sentence to be worried about.

357
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:55,540
We can finally live a peaceful life.

358
00:20:56,050 --> 00:20:56,900
He had it coming.

359
00:20:57,230 --> 00:20:57,890
Yeah.

360
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:01,700
Administrator Du,

361
00:21:02,870 --> 00:21:04,150
we're not sure whether that dead man

362
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:04,980
is Sass yet.

363
00:21:05,290 --> 00:21:06,610
Why did you post that notice?

364
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:11,010
You're not sure about it?

365
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:13,110
Then why did you look irritated

366
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:14,620
when I questioned

367
00:21:14,850 --> 00:21:16,550
the identity of the dead man yesterday?

368
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:18,400
Many people have seen the body.

369
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:20,360
Only half of them

370
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,120
think the dead man is Sass.

371
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:22,450
That man's true identity is yet to be revealed.

372
00:21:22,790 --> 00:21:24,220
Why did you make that announcement?

373
00:21:25,530 --> 00:21:27,380
I was just carrying out an order.

374
00:21:27,570 --> 00:21:28,270
Whose order?

375
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:29,920
Why are you so strident?

376
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,070
You can't do anything

377
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:33,240
even if I tell you whose order it is.

378
00:21:33,570 --> 00:21:34,670
Just tell me.

379
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:35,780
The Crown Prince.

380
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:38,650
He did it for your good.

381
00:21:38,910 --> 00:21:41,290
He thinks the Minister of Justice of Yongzhou

382
00:21:41,810 --> 00:21:43,350
is too low-ranked for you and wants you

383
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:45,090
to use it as a stepping stone to quickly make your name known

384
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,350
so that you can be promoted to a higher position.

385
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:47,230
He has more important tasks

386
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,680
for you in the future.

387
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:51,730
Listen,

388
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:52,640
Lu Lingfeng,

389
00:21:53,370 --> 00:21:55,880
that dead man

390
00:21:55,910 --> 00:21:57,870
looks a bit like Sass

391
00:21:58,010 --> 00:21:58,770
but I've never

392
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:01,340
thought that he was Sass.

393
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:03,150
To catch Sass,

394
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:06,580
I waited for 12 years.

395
00:22:07,190 --> 00:22:08,330
If he could

396
00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:09,300
be killed by you so easily,

397
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:10,730
the 12 years I spent on this case

398
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:12,620
would be a joke.

399
00:22:14,010 --> 00:22:15,210
12 years?

400
00:22:16,470 --> 00:22:17,110
Administrator Du…

401
00:22:21,850 --> 00:22:22,930
You don't need to know

402
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:24,330
the whole story.

403
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:27,460
I don't feel like telling you either.

404
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:37,460
I heard that you have doubts

405
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:38,670
about the identity of that dead man.

406
00:22:39,370 --> 00:22:40,310
Since Your Highness knows it,

407
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:42,970
why did you ask Du Ming to post that notice?

408
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:44,660
To reassure the people.

409
00:22:45,810 --> 00:22:46,640
The Mid-Autumn Festival is coming.

410
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:48,610
His Majesty insists on holding

411
00:22:48,650 --> 00:22:49,280
the magic show

412
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:50,090
because he wants to show

413
00:22:50,110 --> 00:22:51,320
that our people are living a prosperous and peaceful life.

414
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:52,740
The man named Sass

415
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:55,200
once unsettled

416
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:56,060
everyone in the court.

417
00:22:56,670 --> 00:22:58,180
He's now in Chang'an,

418
00:22:58,340 --> 00:23:00,450
and has openly provoked the imperial court.

419
00:23:01,490 --> 00:23:02,180
Moreover,

420
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:04,430
he's a first-class magician.

421
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:06,020
Think about it.

422
00:23:06,610 --> 00:23:07,760
If we didn't kill this outlaw,

423
00:23:08,170 --> 00:23:09,470
who would dare to attend

424
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:10,340
the magic show?

425
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:12,420
Second, it is to lure the enemy.

426
00:23:12,970 --> 00:23:14,460
It is said that Sass is meticulous.

427
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:16,600
If he is alive,

428
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:17,990
will he let his guard down

429
00:23:18,890 --> 00:23:20,620
after he sees that notice?

430
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:22,220
In that case,

431
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:25,100
isn't it easier

432
00:23:25,390 --> 00:23:26,800
for Minister Lu to arrest him?

433
00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:30,610
I appreciate

434
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:32,540
your kindness, Your Highness.

435
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:34,860
But

436
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:37,720
so far,

437
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:39,480
there is no other clue.

438
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:40,660
No hurry.

439
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:43,130
Within just a few days,

440
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:45,030
you have managed to arrest the murderer of Wan An.

441
00:23:45,570 --> 00:23:47,070
It shows that you have extraordinary skills.

442
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:48,650
It seems that you've benefited a lot

443
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:50,840
from traveling to the south.

444
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:00,380
Thank you, Princess.

445
00:24:01,410 --> 00:24:02,490
Without your guidance,

446
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:04,610
I wouldn't have arrested that Sass.

447
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:08,400
That Sass?

448
00:24:09,430 --> 00:24:09,990
What do you mean?

449
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:12,820
To be honest,

450
00:24:13,330 --> 00:24:14,180
it was so easy

451
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:15,300
to catch him

452
00:24:15,730 --> 00:24:17,150
that I suspect his real identity.

453
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:18,790
Sass used to be the deputy supervisor

454
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:19,580
of the Concubinus Institution.

455
00:24:20,330 --> 00:24:21,370
Many people from the imperial court

456
00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:22,460
have met him.

457
00:24:22,970 --> 00:24:24,700
I've asked about ten people to identify the dead body.

458
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:26,080
Half of them

459
00:24:26,270 --> 00:24:27,420
said that he was Sass,

460
00:24:28,110 --> 00:24:29,940
while the other half was suspicious about the identity of the body.

461
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:31,710
So I think…

462
00:24:32,690 --> 00:24:34,130
It doesn't matter

463
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:34,880
if the dead guy was Sass or not.

464
00:24:35,610 --> 00:24:37,460
You killed Wei Fenghua for me.

465
00:24:38,030 --> 00:24:39,430
I should thank you.

466
00:24:41,270 --> 00:24:43,540
Wei Fenghua was very capable

467
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:45,200
and loyal.

468
00:24:46,210 --> 00:24:48,290
But he had been stirring up

469
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:49,780
between the Crown Prince and me.

470
00:24:50,290 --> 00:24:52,350
After all, the Crown Prince is my nephew.

471
00:24:53,270 --> 00:24:54,900
This is my family matter.

472
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:57,030
But he tried to take advantage of me

473
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:59,420
to revenge the his own family.

474
00:24:59,790 --> 00:25:01,230
Did he think that I'm a fool?

475
00:25:03,990 --> 00:25:05,200
After the trip to Dongdu,

476
00:25:05,790 --> 00:25:06,830
I've thought about

477
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:08,690
many things.

478
00:25:09,770 --> 00:25:10,620
Compared to people like

479
00:25:10,650 --> 00:25:11,850
Li Yue and Gao Zhongyi,

480
00:25:12,170 --> 00:25:14,360
I feel that the Crown Prince is closer to me.

481
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:16,420
And you.

482
00:25:17,870 --> 00:25:19,040
Although you work for the Crown Prince,

483
00:25:19,890 --> 00:25:21,420
you risked your life to save me.

484
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:25,590
It made me feel so close to you.

485
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:35,150
I don't care if you're 23

486
00:25:35,290 --> 00:25:36,340
or 25.

487
00:25:37,250 --> 00:25:38,200
I have a child

488
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:39,760
who is the same age as you.

489
00:25:41,370 --> 00:25:42,250
Even though

490
00:25:42,270 --> 00:25:43,470
I did something wrong to him,

491
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:46,120
I had no choice.

492
00:25:46,990 --> 00:25:47,500
If

493
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:49,660
he knows my suffering

494
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,270
all these years,

495
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:54,060
he will definitely forgive me.

496
00:25:56,970 --> 00:25:57,980
Definitely.

497
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:06,520
Tell me.

498
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:09,640
If the Crown Prince ascends the throne,

499
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:10,820
can I still

500
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:12,410
stand here in Beyond Heaven

501
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:15,200
and look down at Chang'an?

502
00:26:25,650 --> 00:26:26,340
Su Wuming.

503
00:26:26,890 --> 00:26:28,170
Stop looking for The Tale of Sass.

504
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:29,060
I'm hungry.

505
00:26:30,910 --> 00:26:31,320
Hungry?

506
00:26:32,620 --> 00:26:33,820
Actually, I'm hungry too.

507
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:35,680
But listen to me,

508
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:38,210
The Tale of Sass appeared in the market

509
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:39,420
half a year ago.

510
00:26:39,790 --> 00:26:40,980
I think it had something to do with

511
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:42,630
the reappearance of Sass.

512
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:45,380
I want to see

513
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:47,450
how my teacher is written in the book.

514
00:26:49,510 --> 00:26:51,070
Are you suspecting

515
00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:52,470
that the notice is fake?

516
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:53,850
Don't talk nonsense.

517
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:55,100
Now,

518
00:26:55,540 --> 00:26:57,530
Lu Lingfeng is the Minister of Justice of Yongzhou.

519
00:26:57,670 --> 00:26:59,590
He's the one who killed Sass too.

520
00:26:59,950 --> 00:27:00,910
How could it be fake?

521
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:03,550
But despite what you said,

522
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:06,220
I can see suspicion in your eyes.

523
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:13,920
The Sass case was my teacher's last case.

524
00:27:14,270 --> 00:27:15,710
Failing to catch Sass before he died

525
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:17,500
was his biggest regret.

526
00:27:17,930 --> 00:27:18,590
But Lu Lingfeng killed Sass

527
00:27:18,610 --> 00:27:19,930
so easily.

528
00:27:20,410 --> 00:27:22,440
I think it's a bit...

529
00:27:22,570 --> 00:27:24,020
So you want

530
00:27:24,050 --> 00:27:25,820
to fulfill your teacher's wish

531
00:27:26,230 --> 00:27:27,660
and catch Sass.

532
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:28,940
Unexpectedly,

533
00:27:29,370 --> 00:27:30,730
someone else took the credit,

534
00:27:31,110 --> 00:27:32,870
and you're unhappy with it?

535
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:37,550
Am I that narrow-minded?

536
00:27:38,410 --> 00:27:38,900
Yes.

537
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:41,240
That's enough.

538
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:42,240
I remember

539
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:43,190
there is a bookstore ahead.

540
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:43,980
Let's go and have a look.

541
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:45,390
Let's go.

542
00:27:49,070 --> 00:27:51,470
[Nameless Old Bookstore]

543
00:28:01,870 --> 00:28:02,910
Stop sleeping.

544
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:05,140
Do you have The Tale of Sass here?

545
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:07,130
What book do you want?

546
00:28:08,170 --> 00:28:09,490
The Tale of Sass.

547
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:13,420
The Tale of Sass?

548
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:15,560
No, no, no.

549
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:18,980
The book has been banned by the government.

550
00:28:19,310 --> 00:28:19,940
Let me tell you.

551
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:21,150
The book contains

552
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:24,460
a lot of filth related to Heavenly Empress.

553
00:28:24,730 --> 00:28:25,660
I don't sell it here.

554
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:27,250
Don't you cause any trouble for me.

555
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:31,580
Looks like it's completely forbidden.

556
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:37,110
It's useless even if we came with so much gold.

557
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:39,620
Wait.

558
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:46,660
Are you from the government?

559
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:48,490
Are you here to check on the banned books

560
00:28:48,750 --> 00:28:49,830
to test me?

561
00:28:52,170 --> 00:28:53,210
Do you think

562
00:28:53,490 --> 00:28:54,810
I look like an official?

563
00:28:55,350 --> 00:28:55,740
Yes.

564
00:28:56,930 --> 00:28:59,160
But people from the government

565
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:02,470
usually don't come with their family.

566
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:07,380
I'm just a businessman.

567
00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:09,070
I came to the capital

568
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:10,880
to watch the magic show.

569
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:12,740
There are still a few days

570
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:13,780
for the show to start,

571
00:29:14,190 --> 00:29:15,030
and I'm bored.

572
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:16,520
After I came here,

573
00:29:16,690 --> 00:29:18,900
I heard that The Tale of Sass is good,

574
00:29:19,410 --> 00:29:20,540
so I want to buy one.

575
00:29:21,010 --> 00:29:22,680
If you have one, sell it to me.

576
00:29:24,510 --> 00:29:26,280
If you really want it,

577
00:29:27,030 --> 00:29:28,030
I'll think of a way.

578
00:29:29,270 --> 00:29:30,950
But you should

579
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:32,330
reward me accordingly.

580
00:29:32,790 --> 00:29:33,670
Name your price.

581

500 coins?

582
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:44,290
Are you dreaming?

583
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:50,350
Are you charging me 5,000 coins?

584
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:51,860
This is a banned book.

585
00:29:52,220 --> 00:29:53,820
I'll bear the risk of imprisonment

586
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:54,540
to sell it to you.

587
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:55,780
Is it expensive?

588
00:29:56,250 --> 00:29:57,610
Didn't you just say

589
00:29:57,630 --> 00:29:59,350
you brought a lot of gold with you?

590
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:01,090
Were you lying to me?

591
00:30:02,370 --> 00:30:04,250
You're just a poor man.

592
00:30:05,590 --> 00:30:06,780
If you don't buy it,

593
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:08,070
leave then.

595
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:10,380
Enough.

596
00:30:10,930 --> 00:30:12,160
No matter how good the book is,

597
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:13,910
it is still too expensive.

598
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:15,220
Let's go.

599
00:30:21,730 --> 00:30:22,510

observing people?

607
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:43,300
Are you sure that there is The Tale of Sass

608
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:45,070
in this nameless bookstore?

609
00:30:45,730 --> 00:30:46,530
There must be.

610
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:50,450
The owner is not a good guy.

611
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:54,380
He hid the banned book and sold it at a high price.

612
00:30:54,650 --> 00:30:55,750
It's no different

613
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:56,880
from robbing.

614
00:30:57,310 --> 00:30:58,370
That's right.

615
00:30:58,780 --> 00:31:00,230
In the eyes of us scholars,

616
00:31:00,330 --> 00:31:01,890
that's even worse than robbing.

617
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:04,520
The owner is a bad guy.

618
00:31:04,850 --> 00:31:05,380
A bad guy!

619
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:06,820
That's easy.

620
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:09,060
In dealing with bad guys,

621
00:31:09,490 --> 00:31:11,180
dirty tricks will work better.

622
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:12,620

625
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:41,220
I've found it.

What?

627
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:44,240
That book, The Tale of Sass.

628

00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:48,570
Great!

00:32:40,850 --> 00:32:41,580

How are you going to thank me?

633

00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:50,530
a delicacy in Chang'an.

635
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:51,750
It suits as an appreciation gift for you.

642
00:33:06,290 --> 00:33:07,480

I'll take you there now.

If you don't get to eat the Cherry Dumplings,

647
00:33:13,690 --> 00:33:15,330
just don't give me the book.

useful to you?

Yes.

656
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:45,550
I'm here to request for your help again.

657
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:48,140
This is The Tale of Sass which appeared

658
00:33:48,330 --> 00:33:49,750
in Chang'an half a year ago.

659
00:33:50,060 --> 00:33:50,830
It's written in it

660
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:52,340
that Sass's old lover in Chang'an is someone

661
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:53,540
named Helan Xue.

662
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:54,590
According to the book,

663
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:56,030
Sass loved her so much.

664
00:33:56,620 --> 00:33:58,530
They lost contact

665
00:33:58,860 --> 00:33:59,740
just because he ran away in panic that time.

666
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:01,720
I suspect

667
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:04,460
that Sass appeared in Chang'an this time

668
00:34:04,930 --> 00:34:06,090
to find Helan Xue.

669
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:08,530
But we don't know where she is.

670
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:09,360
So,

671
00:34:09,940 --> 00:34:11,110
I want you to draw a portrait for me.

672
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:12,770
So

673
00:34:13,050 --> 00:34:14,940
the man you killed wasn't Sass?

674
00:34:15,179 --> 00:34:16,060
You are smart.

675
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:19,400
We can't conclude about it yet.

676
00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:21,170
But it's very suspicious.

677
00:34:21,620 --> 00:34:23,659
You want me to draw a portrait

678
00:34:23,860 --> 00:34:24,860
based on the description in the book?

679
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:27,010
This...

680
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:29,810
It seems difficult.

681
00:34:31,290 --> 00:34:32,380
I know it's hard for you.

682
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:34,130
But this is

683
00:34:34,659 --> 00:34:35,929
the only clue I have now.

684
00:34:36,139 --> 00:34:36,580
So...

685
00:34:40,219 --> 00:34:41,679
So you must help me.

686
00:34:43,290 --> 00:34:44,350
For free?

687
00:34:45,179 --> 00:34:46,610
Of course I can't let you help me for nothing.

688
00:34:47,190 --> 00:34:48,550
I will reward you in the future.

689
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:49,870
No need.

690
00:34:50,179 --> 00:34:51,409
It's not too late yet.

691
00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:52,659
I'm hungry.

692
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:53,600
What do you want to eat?

693
00:34:53,780 --> 00:34:54,630
I'll buy it for you.

694
00:34:54,940 --> 00:34:55,340
No.

695
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:57,200
It won't taste good if you buy it.

696
00:34:57,810 --> 00:34:59,400
I want some freshly cooked

697
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:00,530
Cherry Dumplings.

698
00:35:01,650 --> 00:35:03,660
Cherry Dumplings?

699
00:35:04,670 --> 00:35:05,470
Why haven't I heard of

700
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:06,020
this thing?

701
00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:07,030
You've been in Chang'an

702
00:35:07,060 --> 00:35:07,860
for so long.

703
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:09,050
Take me out.

704
00:35:09,250 --> 00:35:09,930
I'll take you to the place.

705
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:18,590
Boss.

706
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:19,870
Another bowl, please.

707
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:20,460
Okay.

708
00:35:20,930 --> 00:35:21,620
Please enjoy. Thank you.

709
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:24,510
This is the food I missed the most

710
00:35:24,830 --> 00:35:26,120
after leaving Chang'an.

711
00:35:26,230 --> 00:35:27,020
Can this

712
00:35:27,370 --> 00:35:28,210
taste good?

713
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:29,800
Just try it.

714
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:30,900
Here, sir. It's done.

715
00:35:37,660 --> 00:35:38,420
It's so delicious.

716
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:45,570
Sir, your wine.

717
00:35:45,820 --> 00:35:46,850
Okay, thank you.

718
00:35:54,870 --> 00:35:56,460
This is so delicious.

719
00:35:56,730 --> 00:35:57,410
I haven't eaten

720
00:35:57,430 --> 00:35:58,500
anything this delicious before,

721
00:35:58,820 --> 00:35:59,940
and it's named

722
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:00,620
by my own name.

723
00:36:01,930 --> 00:36:03,720
Delicious? Not necessarily.

724
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:08,720
It depends on the one who is eating with you.

725
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:10,660
Are you praising yourself?

726
00:36:12,220 --> 00:36:13,490
Let's say so.

727
00:36:14,580 --> 00:36:15,430
But I...

728
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:16,860
know my place.

729
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:18,200
I know.

730
00:36:18,460 --> 00:36:21,380
I'm a little petty sometimes,

731
00:36:22,820 --> 00:36:23,810
a little serious,

732
00:36:25,450 --> 00:36:26,450
and pedantic.

733
00:36:30,930 --> 00:36:31,380
That's all?

734
00:36:31,810 --> 00:36:33,400
That's all.

735
00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:34,800
Besides,

736
00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:36,790
comparing to my strengths,

737
00:36:36,810 --> 00:36:38,330
my weaknesses are

738
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:40,080
not worth mentioning.

739
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:43,720
Su Wuming.

740
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:45,700
What's wrong with you today?

741
00:36:47,870 --> 00:36:49,710
When we entered the city today,

742
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:51,940
we pretended to be husband and wife,

743
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:54,110
and it has reminded me.

744
00:36:54,590 --> 00:36:55,470
After thinking about it,

745
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:57,130
I'm not young anymore.

746
00:36:58,900 --> 00:37:00,570
Time flies,

747
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:03,100
just like a white pony's shadow across a crevice.

748
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:05,080
Time doesn't wait.

749
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:07,860
If you don't mind me being old...

750
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:11,040
You've only bought me some

751
00:37:11,060 --> 00:37:12,110
Cherry Dumplings,

752
00:37:12,570 --> 00:37:13,740
but you are trying to discuss

753
00:37:14,210 --> 00:37:15,220
this serious matter with me now.

754
00:37:16,540 --> 00:37:17,180
Su Wuming,

755
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:20,120
you're so calculative.

756
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:21,100
I...

757
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:23,020
Waiter!

758
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:24,150
Another

759
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:25,390
20 Cherry Dumplings.

760
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:30,740
Just the two of us.

761
00:37:30,820 --> 00:37:31,740
20 dumplings?

762
00:37:31,770 --> 00:37:32,800
How can we finish them?

763
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:34,630
I can eat them tomorrow

764
00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:35,420
if I can't finish them.

765
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:36,800
Besides,

766
00:37:37,210 --> 00:37:38,500
such delicious food,

767
00:37:39,150 --> 00:37:40,830
I have to send some to Xijun.

768
00:37:41,140 --> 00:37:41,650
Is there any problem?

769
00:37:42,820 --> 00:37:43,800
Fine.

770
00:37:43,950 --> 00:37:46,400
Think of the 5,000 coins I've saved for you.

771
00:37:46,740 --> 00:37:48,440
You are not even willing to

772
00:37:49,090 --> 00:37:50,030
buy me 20 Cherry Dumplings,

773
00:37:50,780 --> 00:37:52,730
yet you still want to discuss such thing with me?

774
00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:53,970
Su Wuming.

775
00:37:54,290 --> 00:37:55,660
You're so stingy.

776
00:37:56,340 --> 00:37:57,490
-I… -He's indeed stingy.

777
00:37:59,250 --> 00:37:59,780
Xijun.

778
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:00,330
Who are you talking about?

779
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:01,160
Why are you here?

780
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:01,940
Yingtao,

781
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:03,570
you're so nice.

782
00:38:03,650 --> 00:38:05,370
You still remember me when you are eating delicious food.

783
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:09,560
Su Wuming.

784
00:38:09,860 --> 00:38:11,460
As an imperial official,

785
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:13,060
you left your position

786
00:38:13,290 --> 00:38:14,280
and sneaked into the capital.

787
00:38:14,980 --> 00:38:15,820
Do you know what will be your punishment?

788
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:20,680
Do you still want

789
00:38:20,710 --> 00:38:21,500
the 20 Cherry Dumplings?

790
00:38:21,770 --> 00:38:22,210
Yes.

791
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:23,950
40 of them.

792
00:38:24,270 --> 00:38:25,100
Wrap them up for me.

793
00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:25,740
Okay.

794
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:27,860
I'll pay

795
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:29,320
for them.

796
00:38:59,460 --> 00:38:59,960
How is it?

797
00:39:01,410 --> 00:39:02,420
12 years ago,

798
00:39:03,010 --> 00:39:04,450
I met Sass once.

799
00:39:05,180 --> 00:39:06,620
Although I'm not familiar with him,

800
00:39:07,020 --> 00:39:08,840
I still have some slight impressions of him.

801
00:39:10,370 --> 00:39:12,700
This guy really looks like him.

802
00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:14,890
But at least ten years younger

803
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:16,460
than Sass.

804
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:18,850
Moreover, Sass is the mixblood of

805
00:39:18,870 --> 00:39:20,910
the Han people and the Tokhara people.

806
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:23,810
So, his figure is a little different

807
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:25,750
from ordinary Han people.

808
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:27,780
He has long legs.

809
00:39:28,910 --> 00:39:29,990
This guy doesn't have those long legs.

810
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:32,570
You even know that Sass has long legs?

811
00:39:33,150 --> 00:39:34,470
There was a main task

812
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:36,240
for the Concubinus Institution at that time,

813
00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:38,180
which was to find several concubinus

814
00:39:38,180 --> 00:39:40,020
for Heavenly Empress.

815
00:39:40,830 --> 00:39:42,030
But Sass set

816
00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:43,280
a strange rule.

817
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:45,500
Only those who have legs as long as his,

818
00:39:45,630 --> 00:39:47,000
or have legs longer than his

819
00:39:47,020 --> 00:39:49,770
can be recommended to Heavenly Empress.

820
00:39:50,780 --> 00:39:51,270
Of course,

821
00:39:52,010 --> 00:39:53,690
it's just a rumor.

822
00:39:54,150 --> 00:39:54,940
But I think

823
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:57,670
it must be backed up with some facts.

824
00:39:57,820 --> 00:39:58,340
Anyway,

825
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:00,760
this isn't Sass?

826
00:40:02,540 --> 00:40:03,130
No.

827
00:40:09,730 --> 00:40:12,380
It's rare to see Su Wuming being so generous.

828
00:40:12,850 --> 00:40:13,340
Xijun.

829
00:40:13,430 --> 00:40:13,900
Eat up.

830
00:40:14,770 --> 00:40:15,540
It's delicious.

831
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:16,640
-Have some water. -Eat more.

832
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:18,020
Eat slowly. Don't choke yourself.

833
00:40:21,950 --> 00:40:22,740
The Crown Prince has

834
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:23,990
provided this small house for me to stay for the time being.

835
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:25,430
But I'm not used to live alone,

836
00:40:26,610 --> 00:40:27,340
so I moved to the military camp

837
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:28,490
with Guo Zhuang.

838
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:30,300
Since you're here,

839
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:31,520
I'll let you stay here.

840
00:40:31,770 --> 00:40:32,680
Great.

841
00:40:33,030 --> 00:40:33,960
To be honest,

842
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:36,730
I went to several inns just now.

843
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:37,350
However,

844
00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:39,660
they were all fully booked

845
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:41,260
by magicians from everywhere.

846
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:43,020
I was worried about having no place to stay.

847
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:44,210
Su Wuming.

848
00:40:45,050 --> 00:40:45,730
I know

849
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:47,470
what Detective Di means to you.

850
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:49,010
But you're acting too impulsively

851
00:40:50,130 --> 00:40:51,400
this time.

852
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:54,180
Sass has disappeared for 12 years.

853
00:40:54,220 --> 00:40:55,630
Now we've finally found him.

854
00:40:55,660 --> 00:40:56,930
If I sit and watch but do nothing,

855
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:59,760
how can I

856
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:01,220
enter the Memorial Temple of Master Di?

857
00:41:04,140 --> 00:41:06,310
Today is the eighth day of August.

858
00:41:07,550 --> 00:41:08,440
The Mid-Autumn Festival

859
00:41:08,690 --> 00:41:09,770
is in seven days.

860
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:11,040
I really...

861
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:14,130
At the moment,

862
00:41:14,780 --> 00:41:15,890
there is no clue at all.

863
00:41:17,580 --> 00:41:19,950
You've asked Xijun

864
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:21,820
to draw the portrait of Helan Xue for you.

865
00:41:22,660 --> 00:41:24,470
That's a good idea.

866
00:41:24,910 --> 00:41:26,700
When Sass was in Luoyang,

867
00:41:26,930 --> 00:41:27,890
he used to travel back and forth

868
00:41:28,090 --> 00:41:30,070
between Luoyang and Chang'an every month.

869
00:41:30,190 --> 00:41:31,990
And he never told anyone

870
00:41:32,020 --> 00:41:33,080
about his purpose travelling here.

871
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:35,640
I've read The Tale of Sass.

872
00:41:35,810 --> 00:41:37,370
It's written clearly in the book

873
00:41:37,490 --> 00:41:39,450
that he came here for Helan Xue.

874
00:41:40,060 --> 00:41:41,780
And at the end of the book,

875
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:45,730
it's written that there was a Bizhen Pearl

876
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:48,560
by my teacher's bed.

877
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:49,980
I've also noticed

878
00:41:50,260 --> 00:41:51,050
this detail.

879
00:41:51,090 --> 00:41:52,770
After my master fell ill,

880
00:41:53,330 --> 00:41:56,000
his wife took out the precious

881
00:41:56,050 --> 00:41:56,720
Bichen Pearl

882
00:41:57,070 --> 00:41:59,830
and placed it by the bed to pray for my teacher.

883
00:41:59,860 --> 00:42:00,890
Outsiders would never

884
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:03,180
know this.

885
00:42:03,510 --> 00:42:06,950
Only those officials

886
00:42:07,070 --> 00:42:09,660
who were close to my teacher

887
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:12,130
would accidentally see it when they were visiting my teacher.

888
00:42:13,470 --> 00:42:14,300
So,

889
00:42:15,470 --> 00:42:16,280
the author

890
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:18,890
must be Detective Di's colleague.

891
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:22,170
His pen name is Nanshan Salouzi.

892
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:24,820
I guess he is living in seclusion

893
00:42:25,230 --> 00:42:27,200
in the Zhongnan Mountain now.

894
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:28,860
But there are thousands of real and fake recluses

895
00:42:29,020 --> 00:42:31,100
in the Zhongnan Mountain.

896
00:42:31,260 --> 00:42:32,500
How can we find

897
00:42:32,530 --> 00:42:33,360
this Salouzi?

898
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:39,140
I know what is the surname

899
00:42:39,170 --> 00:42:39,970
of this Salouzi!

900
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:57,620
♫The storm rises with no reason♫

901
00:42:58,330 --> 00:43:00,700
♫In the night of illusions♫

902
00:43:02,490 --> 00:43:04,080
♫I go into the maze♫

903
00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:10,970
♫In a world of prosperity♫

904
00:43:12,120 --> 00:43:14,150
♫A heart burns with obsession♫

905
00:43:15,170 --> 00:43:17,120
♫With the darkness rising♫

906
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:24,130
♫I can't stop wandering through the night♫

907
00:43:24,980 --> 00:43:31,160
♫With light in my heart, I'm not afraid of the storm♫

908
00:43:31,490 --> 00:43:35,210
♫It's because of justice♫

909
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:43,820
♫That I seek a truth for this long, lonely night♫

910
00:43:44,570 --> 00:43:50,460
♫The heaven and earth are held together by a strong will♫

911

♫The people are in peace♫

912
00:43:53,450 --> 00:43:57,610
♫Carving right and wrong into a clear heart♫

913
00:43:58,030 --> 00:43:59,260
♫The truth♫

914
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:02,950
♫Will reinterpret this justice♫

915
00:44:04,810 --> 00:44:09,100
♫Even if there is fog♫

916
00:44:09,750 --> 00:44:12,100
♫Even if there are invisible waves♫

917
00:44:13,690 --> 00:44:15,690
♫I'll tell the story of the fate♫

918
00:44:17,790 --> 00:44:22,220
♫Tell the love of the world♫

919
00:44:23,510 --> 00:44:25,710
♫For the memory of grace♫

920
00:44:26,630 --> 00:44:29,000
♫And the resentment is not yet over♫

921
00:44:29,950 --> 00:44:35,390
♫The rivers and mountains are immortal, the clouds are overturned♫

922
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:42,550
♫To be consoled by the truth, even with thorns on my back♫

923
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:47,280
♫Only for justice♫

924
00:44:49,260 --> 00:44:55,540
♫That I seek a truth for this long, lonely night♫

925

♫The truth♫

♫Even if there are a thousand sails, it's not a waste of time♫

931
00:45:21,820 --> 00:45:28,000
♫What I am afraid of is the unrighted wrong♫

932
00:45:28,620 --> 00:45:30,530
♫What is the meaning of life and death?♫

933
00:45:30,820 --> 00:45:34,950
♫I'll paint the sunshine into the landscape♫

934
00:45:35,220 --> 00:45:36,920
♫The spirit of righteousness♫

♫Exists for the one I care♫
