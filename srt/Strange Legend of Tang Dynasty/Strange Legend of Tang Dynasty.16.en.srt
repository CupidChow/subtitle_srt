That's true.

5
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:47,940
I saw it.

6
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:49,880
And I also heard it.

7
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:56,100
Do you feel better?

8
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:58,710
Barely able to stand.

9
00:01:59,509 --> 00:02:01,070
But the wound still hurts when I walk.

10
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:07,230
My retainer is proficient in medicine.

11
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:09,060
I got some medicine from him.

12
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:11,009
You can recover faster

13
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:13,020
by putting it on your wound.

14
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:15,250
Thank you. Your Honor.

15
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:18,430
I knew there was something wrong

00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:19,280
with Dugu Xiashu.

17
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:21,120
We should have arrested him long time ago.

18
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:23,050
Minister Lu, Commander Su.

19
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:24,970
Dugu Xiashu is running away.

20
00:02:25,579 --> 00:02:26,040
What?

21
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:26,960
He drank all night

last night.

23
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:29,050
He didn't go home this morning

24
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:30,260
and wanted to leave the city.

25
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:31,510
I had to stop him.

26
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:33,410
But he ran away

27
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:34,350
and insisted on going out.

28
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:35,730
What happened then?

29
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:37,520
I had to arrest him.

30

Headman Xie.

31
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:53,460

00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:53,870
Yes.

What happened,

36
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:12,150
sir?

37
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:13,910
Did you

38
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:16,900
find Qinghong's body?

39
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:18,550
Her body?

40
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:20,180
What did you say?

41
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:21,660
She's dead?

42
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:25,700
Dugu came back at 5 p.m,

43
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:30,040
and killed his wife at night.

44
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:35,240
Sir, you have a good memory

45
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:37,730
that you can remember the exact hour.

46
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:39,400
Because

47
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:41,300
the lanterns of Zixia Building will be lit

48

49

It can't be wrong.

50
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:49,290
Did you see him kill his wife?

51
00:03:49,829 --> 00:03:51,200
No， I didn't.

52
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:53,270
But I heard him

53
00:03:53,329 --> 00:03:55,040
sharpen  knife in the middle of the night.

54
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:58,010
Although it was raining that night,

55
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,220
and I am hard of hearing,

56
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:02,830
I still heard clearly

57
00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:05,780
he was

58
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,340
sharpening the knife.

59
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:12,900
As far as I know,

60
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,480
Qinghong went back to her maiden home.

61
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:16,870
That's impossible.

62
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:19,459
She did go back to maiden home

63
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:20,640
over the years

64
00:04:21,339 --> 00:04:22,570
she was married to Dugu Xiashu,

65
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:26,130
but only for a day or two at most.

66
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:28,530
I haven't seen her for a long time.

67
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,800
What a pity

68
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,230
for such a good woman.

69
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:38,040
Sharpen the knife?

70
00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:43,750
And her brother who lived in He County

71
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:45,800
didn't see his sister back.

72
00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:47,040
How could it be？

73
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:49,180
Did she meet bandits on the way?

74
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:57,270
How dare you lie to us!

75
00:04:57,970 --> 00:04:58,460
Tell me！

76
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:00,820
Is she alive or dead?

77
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:02,490
That night I found

78
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:04,070
she did something shameful.

79
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:06,210
I was angry.

80
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:07,570
I s-s-strangled

81
00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:08,610
her neck.

82
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:09,710
And then?

83
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:12,200
T-T-Then, I thought

84
00:05:12,530 --> 00:05:13,940
I didn't take good care of her

85
00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:14,880
these years.

86
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:16,500
I felt guilty,

87
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:17,860
so I went to the kitchen...

88
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:19,010
I went to the kitchen…

89
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:20,260
and made her a bowl of wonton.

90
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:24,460
I remember now.

91
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,260
I must have found that the knife was too dull

92
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:27,460
to cut the meat,

93
00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:28,800
so I sharpened it again.

94
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,400
Were you cutting meat

95
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:31,500
or Qinghong?

96
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:33,620
You're playing dumb with evil intentions.

97
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:35,440
It seems you want me to torture you.

98
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,010
I really can't remember

99
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,120
that I killed Qinghong.

100
00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:39,570
I remember.

101
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:41,790
I can only remember...

102
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:44,200
We were back together again.

103
00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:52,500
Back together?

104
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:54,010
Yes.

105
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:55,390
Why did you fight before?

106
00:05:57,580 --> 00:05:58,090
I...

107
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:00,180
can't tell you.

108
00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:03,860
Did you suspect that Qinghong and Liu Youqiu...

109
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:06,920
How did you know?

110
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,060
You have also threatened

111
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:16,310
to kill Liu Youqiu.

112
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:19,030
Yes.

113
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:20,180
But I didn't kill him.

114
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:22,480
I wanted to interrogate  Qinghong

115
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:23,860
first.

116
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:25,540
She got angry

117
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:26,730
and hit me.

118
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:28,700
It's normal

119
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:29,900
for a couple.

120
00:06:30,730 --> 00:06:31,900
And then

121
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:33,490
she said she was hungry.

122
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:34,720
So I went to the kitchen

123
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:35,760
to make her a bowl of wonton.

124
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:36,940
It was delicious.

125
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:38,000
Did she eat?

126
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:43,790
She...

127
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:45,750
Did she eat?

128
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:48,620
Honey,

129
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:50,120
guess what I made for you.

130
00:06:50,530 --> 00:06:51,400
Your favorite food.

131
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:53,850
Honey?

132
00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:02,600
I remember now!

133
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:04,290
She's gone.

134
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:05,590
I searched her everywhere,

135
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:06,380
but couldn't find her.

136
00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:07,490
I thought

137
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:09,100
she must have gone back to her maiden home

138
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:10,340
because she was angry with me

139
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:11,080
So I...

140
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:11,950
You're lying.

141
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:15,650
I told you

142
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:17,730
she left early in the morning.

143
00:07:22,570 --> 00:07:23,560
Here's what I think.

144
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:26,340
She won't choose the mountain road at night.

145
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:27,410
Besides, it's raining.

146
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:29,440
She must have found a place

147
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:30,020
to hide.

148
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:30,820
She waited until dawn

149
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:31,880
before she went back to her maiden home.

150
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:33,430
You didn't study

151
00:07:33,450 --> 00:07:34,220
to pass the exam,

152
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,050
but to lie, right?

153
00:07:39,290 --> 00:07:39,850
Wait.

154
00:07:40,659 --> 00:07:41,490
Commander just said

155
00:07:41,659 --> 00:07:42,740
Qinghong didn't go home.

156
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:43,770
Did she really

157
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:44,650
took a mountain road at night

158
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:47,050
and was robbed by bandits?

159
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:49,340
It's too late for you

160
00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:51,650
to check her safety

161
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:53,340
now.

162
00:07:53,850 --> 00:07:54,800
Dudu Xiashu.

163
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:55,920
Are you really not going

164
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:57,100
tell us the truth?

165
00:07:57,740 --> 00:08:00,780
I really didn't kill her.

166
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:01,740
The rain must

167
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:03,790
make your brain moldy.

168
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,000
Think carefully about

169
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,530
if you did it or not.

170
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:19,370
I killed someone.

171
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:23,670
I killed someone.

172
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:36,620
I was about to

173
00:08:36,789 --> 00:08:37,980
investigate it.

174
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:41,659
Don't bother.

175
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:44,300
I've checked everything.

176
00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:45,960
But I didn't move the pot

177
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,110
last time.

178
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:49,710
Why?

179
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:51,220
Didn't you tell me

180
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:52,320
the masked man

181
00:08:52,530 --> 00:08:53,710
jumped in from the window

182
00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:55,420
and went straight to this pot?

183
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:56,580
Likewise,

184
00:08:56,850 --> 00:08:57,850
I thought there was something

185
00:08:57,890 --> 00:08:59,090
in this pot.

186
00:08:59,120 --> 00:08:59,720
But

187
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:01,730
just now it occurred to me that

188
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:04,020
maybe he opened the pot

189
00:09:04,530 --> 00:09:05,290
not because

190
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:06,150
there was something in it.

191
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:07,260
Rather, it was to make it easier for him

192
00:09:07,530 --> 00:09:09,900
to move the pot.

193
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:12,190
Why didn't I think of this?

194
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:17,770
You just recovered.

195
00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:19,600
Don't do it.

196
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:22,260
Dugu Xiashu, come here.

197
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:24,140
Let's go.

198
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:26,080
You...

199
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:29,280
Move this pot away.

200
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:31,720
Me?

201
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,020
Is there anyone else here?

202
00:09:36,830 --> 00:09:38,280
They...

203
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:39,550
are stronger than me.

204
00:09:40,210 --> 00:09:41,480
What a loser!

205
00:09:42,370 --> 00:09:42,790
Let me do it.

206
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:50,990
I command you to

207
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:52,860
move the pot.

208
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:55,140
Fine.

209
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:04,680
Just do it now!

210
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:31,220
Sword.

211
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:43,770
Bring the hoe.

212
00:10:44,050 --> 00:10:44,350
Yes.

213
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:47,950
Here, Commander.

214
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:51,710
Take it.

215
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:54,580
W-W-What are you doing?

216
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:55,710
Take it.

217
00:10:58,380 --> 00:10:58,970
Dig.

218
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:01,150
Find what's buried below.

219
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:07,020
OK, I'll dig it.

220
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:08,390
Commander，you can wait and see

221
00:11:08,650 --> 00:11:09,700
what I will do to you

222
00:11:10,010 --> 00:11:10,670
when I pass the imperial examination.

223
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:11,830
Okay.

224
00:11:12,570 --> 00:11:13,340
I'll wait.

225
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:32,840
It's hidden here by Qinghong.

226
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:36,810
Is this yours?

227
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:38,580
Even the officials in Chang'an

228
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:39,980
don't have sliver ingots.

229
00:11:40,690 --> 00:11:41,420
Where did you get it?

230
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:42,990
This is from my ancestors.

231
00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:44,080
Commander Su,

232
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:45,050
you can be my witness.

233
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:46,110
He is holding my silver ingot

234
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:47,440
now.

235
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:54,660
What are you digging?

236
00:11:54,690 --> 00:11:55,910
The silver ingots have been dug out.

237
00:11:57,030 --> 00:11:58,070
There are another 6 silver ingots.

238
00:11:58,920 --> 00:11:59,560
Six?

239
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:00,330
Yes.

240
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:01,860
My surname is Dugu

241
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:03,270
that you can know

242
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:05,060
my ancestors came here

243
00:12:05,090 --> 00:12:05,830
from the north

244
00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:07,110
My ancestors were officials.

245
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:09,350
Although my family was no longer famous.

246
00:12:09,450 --> 00:12:10,530
I still got 7 silver ingots

247
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:11,580
from my ancestors

248
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:13,430
when I got married.

249
00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:15,860
But my mother gave these silver ingots to Qinghong

250
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:16,660
to prevent

251
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:18,400
me spend it out.

252
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:19,800
She also told her

253
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:21,910
that I can only use it

254
00:12:22,070 --> 00:12:22,790
when I pass the exam.

255
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:26,970
After my mother dead,

256
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:28,370
I kept asking her

257
00:12:28,490 --> 00:12:29,680
where she hid these silver ingots .

258
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:30,850
She just wouldn't tell me.

259
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,590
It was right here.

260
00:12:35,770 --> 00:12:36,380
Where are other

261
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:38,140
six silver ingots?

262
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,420
Did a thief

263
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:40,370
steal it

264
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:42,300
and only left one for me.

265
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:44,110
These are my ancestral silver ingots.

266
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:45,310
My ancestral silver.

267
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:47,070
My silver ingot!

268
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:48,270
Where is it?

269
00:12:48,410 --> 00:12:50,430
It seems that this masked man knows

270
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:51,470
there are silver ingots here.

271
00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:52,260
Six more.

272
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:53,320
Six more.

273
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:54,820
Commander Su,Minister Lu,

274
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:55,590
T-T-The Temple of Land God

275
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:56,510
behind the mountain.

276
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:58,820
Must be hidden below.

277
00:12:58,850 --> 00:12:59,810
Definitely.

278
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:02,060
[The Temple of Land God]

279
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:03,660
This place

280
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:05,020
called Minor Stone Bridge Mountain.

281
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:06,310
Over this hill,

282
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:07,810
that is the Confucian temple.

283
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:08,810
The locals

284
00:13:09,050 --> 00:13:10,830
called this place like back mountain.

285
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:14,380
Here.

286
00:13:17,450 --> 00:13:18,730
Your honor,

287
00:13:21,930 --> 00:13:22,400
why are you here?

288
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,130
Please help me.

289
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:24,680
I...

290
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:26,260
I didn't kill anyone.

291
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:28,810
It's only four hours

292
00:13:29,170 --> 00:13:30,050
after I used your medicine.

293
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:31,340
I felt my butt

294
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:32,020
doesn't hurt so much.

295
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:33,050
I could walk .

296
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:35,710
I just want to pay my respects to Land God.

297
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:36,780
Land God?

298
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:38,070
I've been so unlucky recently.

299
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:39,880
I finally made a fortune,

300
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:41,600
but it brought bad luck.

301
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:43,330
Land God,

302
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:44,320
please bless me to make another fortune

303
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:45,520
undetected

304
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:46,320
and safely.

305
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:49,130
I'll rebuild your golden body.

306
00:14:01,290 --> 00:14:02,050
Last time,

307
00:14:02,570 --> 00:14:03,770
I found gold and silver jewelry

308
00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:04,950
from the walls of Wen Temple.

309
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,030
There must have more jewelry

310
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:09,300
in Land God's body.

311
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:32,140
I was going to drag the body out.

312
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:33,420
But I'm afraid of

313
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:35,940
that will make the Land God angry.

314
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:41,340
So I found a hammer and smashed it.

315
00:14:44,530 --> 00:14:45,100
Smashed it?

316
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:47,260
L-L-Let's get the body out of here?

317
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:47,830
Fine.

318
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:48,710
Cut the crap.

319
00:14:49,810 --> 00:14:50,740
Smash from inside to outside.

320
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:51,820
Be careful.

321
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:53,590
Don't destroy the body.

322
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:54,570
Yes.

323
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:05,940
D... Dugu's wife.

324
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:08,610
Bring Dugu Xiashu to here identify the body.

325
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:09,440
Yes.

326
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:33,850
Qinghong.

327
00:15:34,530 --> 00:15:35,180
Qinghong.

328
00:15:37,190 --> 00:15:38,830
Qinghong Qinghong Qinghong..

329
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:39,980
What else do you have to say?

330
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:41,820
Did you sharpen the knife to mince meat

331
00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:42,720
or kill someone?

332
00:15:43,550 --> 00:15:44,520
Do you remember?

333
00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:45,150
Qinghong.

334
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:47,050
You and Liu Youqiu study together.

335
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:48,200
Your wife occasionally

336
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:49,200
brought you clean clothes

337
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:50,190
to the Wen temple

338
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:51,340
You finally found out

339
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:52,830
they fornicateed

340
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:54,690
while you were away.

341
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:00,590
It was raining heavily that day.

342
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:01,970
You said you went to the bookstore to buy books.

343
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:03,190
In fact,

344
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:05,580
You sneaked home and killed Qinghong.

345
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:06,800
And dragged her body to the back mountain

346
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:08,170
You hid it in the colored sculpture

347
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:10,690
and said she went back to her maiden home

348
00:16:10,710 --> 00:16:11,650
of He County alone.

349
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:12,740
You wanted to create a illusion

350
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:14,010
which she has an accident on the mountain road.

351
00:16:15,310 --> 00:16:17,020
The so-called exam preparation in Chang'an

352
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:18,900
is your pretext for escape.

353
00:16:19,690 --> 00:16:23,210
I-I-It's all my fault.

354
00:17:00,130 --> 00:17:01,450
How painful

355
00:17:02,090 --> 00:17:03,840
when I chopped you.

356
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:09,180
Qinghong, I'd kill you.

357
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:10,890
I'm not human.

358
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:13,849
Qing Hong, I'm not human.

359
00:17:14,569 --> 00:17:15,579
Qinghong.

360
00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:18,839
I'm not human.

361
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:20,869
I remember now.

362
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:22,760
Liu Youqiu

363
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,119
also must be killed by me.

364
00:17:25,099 --> 00:17:26,319
I killed Qinghong

365
00:17:26,349 --> 00:17:27,640
and Liu Youqiu.

366
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:29,740
They deserve to die.

367
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,020
They deserve to die.

368
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:32,570
They all deserve to die.

369
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:46,580
Such a good woman

370
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:48,560
be killed.

371
00:17:57,450 --> 00:18:00,670
Who is sharpening the knife again?

372
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:36,510
Qinghong,

373
00:19:36,730 --> 00:19:37,680
guess what I made for you.

374
00:19:37,890 --> 00:19:38,740
Your favorite food.

375
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:41,210
Qinghong.

376
00:20:09,810 --> 00:20:10,890
I'm so sorry for

377
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:12,790
that I've neglected you all these years.

378
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:13,760
I thought that

379
00:20:14,090 --> 00:20:15,240
everything was for you.

380
00:20:15,790 --> 00:20:16,660
I don't even know

381
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:18,040
take care of you.

382
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,030
I'm not good either.

383
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:22,900
I have a bad temper

384
00:20:23,930 --> 00:20:25,250
and I always get mad at you.

385
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:26,410
You are not.

386
00:20:26,730 --> 00:20:27,620
My wife is gentle.

387
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:29,570
But my bad temper...

388
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,200
All right.

389
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:32,780
Stop it.

390
00:20:52,030 --> 00:20:52,680
Honey,

391
00:20:53,570 --> 00:20:54,710
Why are you still crying?

392
00:20:58,170 --> 00:20:59,440
I'm older than you.

393
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:01,700
Mother asked me to take good care of you

394
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:02,940
before she dead.

395
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,380
I didn't make it.

396
00:21:06,010 --> 00:21:06,760
No, you did well.

397
00:21:07,170 --> 00:21:08,130
Let's stop crying.

398
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:11,850
Promise me,

399
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:13,540
let bygones

400
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:14,690
be bygones.

401
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:17,020
From now on,

402
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:19,640
don't live in the Wen Temple anymore.

403
00:21:20,930 --> 00:21:21,620
I will

404
00:21:24,310 --> 00:21:25,810
stay by your side.

405
00:21:31,510 --> 00:21:32,190
I'll listen to you.

406
00:21:33,390 --> 00:21:34,090
I will Move back.

407
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:40,840
No.

408
00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:41,980
I hope

409
00:21:42,010 --> 00:21:43,290
you go to Chang'an to prepare for the exam.

410
00:21:43,630 --> 00:21:44,270
Chang'an?

411
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:45,460
You can

412
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:46,860
meet many people there.

413
00:21:47,650 --> 00:21:48,470
Maybe

414
00:21:49,110 --> 00:21:49,770
you will be recognized by the proctors

415
00:21:49,790 --> 00:21:51,110
there.

416
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:52,880
You've been studying hard for three years

417
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:53,980
since you failed the exam last time.

418
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:54,990
I believe you can pass it

419
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:56,100
next year.

420
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:58,610
I heard

421
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:00,460
there is a Giant Wild Goose Pagoda in Chang'an.

422
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:02,900
Those who were promoted

423
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:05,470
can engrave their names there.

424
00:22:05,770 --> 00:22:06,930
And they'll be remembered forever.

425
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:11,420
Engrave name on the Giant Wild Goose Pagoda?

426
00:22:12,050 --> 00:22:12,900
I want take our children to here

427
00:22:13,570 --> 00:22:14,890
to see your name

428
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:18,380
someday.

429
00:22:21,410 --> 00:22:22,030
Our children?

430
00:22:23,950 --> 00:22:24,680
Yes.

431
00:22:26,390 --> 00:22:28,000
We have been married for many years.

432
00:22:28,810 --> 00:22:29,670
Did you remember

433
00:22:29,690 --> 00:22:30,710
what mother told you

434
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:31,890
when she was dying?

435
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:33,390
Of course not.

436
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:35,180
But I...

437
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:36,690
I've been studying.

438
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:39,470
Nerd.

439
00:22:40,550 --> 00:22:41,530
Having our children is important

440
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:43,440
as studying.

441
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,760
How about I accompany you to Chang'an?

442
00:22:49,430 --> 00:22:50,400
We would never come back

443
00:22:50,670 --> 00:22:51,930
If you can pass the exam.

444
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:54,680
I'll bring

445
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:57,140
all the silver ingots

446
00:22:57,170 --> 00:22:57,990
if you agree that.

447
00:22:59,370 --> 00:23:00,160
That's great.

448
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,140
We're back together.

449
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:20,560
I didn't kill anyone.

450
00:23:22,810 --> 00:23:23,400
I didn't.

451
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:30,860
No.

452
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:32,600
I killed them.

453
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:34,800
Not only did I kill Qinghong,

454
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:36,650
but also Liu Youqiu.

455
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:40,500
Su Wuming

456
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:42,270
Since we got back from the autopsy at the Temple of the Land God,

457
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:43,470
you didn't say a word.

458
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:43,980
What's wrong?

459
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:45,260
Did I offend you?

460
00:23:47,170 --> 00:23:48,490
Don't say it like that.

461
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:50,470
It makes feel overwhelmed.

462
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:52,260
Why are you suddenly being so polite?

463
00:23:52,930 --> 00:23:54,170
If I did anything wrong,

464
00:23:54,420 --> 00:23:55,540
you can tell me directly.

465
00:23:56,420 --> 00:23:58,060
Don't be so sarcastic.

466
00:23:58,180 --> 00:23:58,990
I dare not.

467
00:23:59,300 --> 00:23:59,940
Su Wuming.

468
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:03,820
Commander Su.

469
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:05,660
Please don't tell me that

470
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:06,980
you feel uncomfortable

471
00:24:07,010 --> 00:24:08,250
because I pointed out directly that

472
00:24:08,930 --> 00:24:09,860
Dugu Xiashu is the murderer.

473
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:17,790
Who said that the murderer is Dugu?

474
00:24:18,170 --> 00:24:19,140
He has confessed.

475
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:20,570
We didn't torture him.

476
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:22,060
We definitely didn't make him confess by torture.

477
00:24:22,510 --> 00:24:23,600
Although there are still some suspicions,

478
00:24:23,930 --> 00:24:25,090
the murderer's confession

479
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:26,770
could not be totally fake, right?

480
00:24:27,390 --> 00:24:28,940
Dugu's confession

481
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:30,340
can't count.

482
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:31,070
Why?

483
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:33,500
First,

484
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:35,790
he was in a trance.

485
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,590
The confession was contradictory.

486
00:24:38,410 --> 00:24:38,790
Second,

487
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:40,940
every murderer

488
00:24:40,970 --> 00:24:41,980
has a sense of

489
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,220
unspeakable hostility,

490
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:45,820
but he doesn't have a bit.

491
00:24:46,370 --> 00:24:46,850
Third,

492
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:49,800
Dugu has a very weak body.

493
00:24:50,090 --> 00:24:52,210
When he moved the pot earlier today,

494
00:24:52,430 --> 00:24:54,990
he was panting and sweating.

495
00:24:55,170 --> 00:24:56,870
He was nearly collapsed.

496
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:59,070
How can he effortlessly

497
00:24:59,090 --> 00:25:00,720
move Qinghong's dead body

498
00:25:01,010 --> 00:25:03,120
to the Temple of Land Lord behind the mountain?

499
00:25:06,650 --> 00:25:07,500
The three points you listed

500
00:25:08,510 --> 00:25:09,680
are unconvincing.

501
00:25:12,370 --> 00:25:12,930
First,

502
00:25:13,570 --> 00:25:14,770
it is because he killed someone that

503
00:25:14,790 --> 00:25:15,870
he was in a trance.

504
00:25:16,570 --> 00:25:17,020
Second,

505
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:19,600
You said that the murderer must have a sense of hostility,

506
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:21,840
but it is just your own experience.

507
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:23,050
However, in my opinion,

508
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:24,180
every criminal

509
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:25,380
has their own characteristics.

510
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:26,520
Third,

511
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:30,000
even if Dugu Xiashu has no strength,

512
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:32,020
can't he find help?

513
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:35,990
The masked man that day

514
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:38,580
might just be his accomplice.

515
00:25:43,790 --> 00:25:45,980
Lu Lingfeng, ah, Lu Lingfeng.

516
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:47,980
It's so comforting for me that

517
00:25:48,010 --> 00:25:49,130
you can analyze the case

518
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:50,410
so calmly.

519
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:51,460
Cut it out.

520
00:25:53,310 --> 00:25:53,930
I think

521
00:25:54,350 --> 00:25:55,790
we should interrogate Dugu Xiashu immediately

522
00:25:56,150 --> 00:25:57,110
and ask him to confess the accomplice.

523
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:59,490
The kitchen knife that killed Qinghong

524
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:01,770
is not that one.

525
00:26:02,950 --> 00:26:06,090
When I examined the body earlier today,

526
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:09,220
the knife wound on her neck

527
00:26:09,250 --> 00:26:10,690
indeed can be fatal.

528
00:26:11,250 --> 00:26:14,190
But if she was dead because of the knife wound,

529
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:17,640
the skin around the wound would be tight and curled,

530
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:20,220
and there would be marks of bleeding.

531
00:26:20,250 --> 00:26:24,170
Qinghong's wound is just the opposite.

532
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:28,360
Why didn't you tell me during the autopsy?

533
00:26:31,050 --> 00:26:32,320
More importantly,

534
00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:36,500
I found an imperceptible pinhole

535
00:26:37,270 --> 00:26:39,840
behind Qinghong's neck.

536
00:26:40,290 --> 00:26:42,230
It was black purple around the pinhole.

537
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:44,120
It's a symptom of poisoning.

538
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:45,860
If I'm not mistaken,

539
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:48,910
that would be the cause of her death.

540
00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:50,180
A pinhole?

541
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:51,940
Could it be...

542
00:26:54,460 --> 00:26:55,220
The masked man

543
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:57,680
who sneaked into Dugu's house that night

544
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:58,710
actually knows

545
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:01,570
where the silver ingot is hiding.

546
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:03,470
It's very likely that

547
00:27:03,490 --> 00:27:05,010
he is close to Qinghong.

548
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:07,290
And the hidden weapon he used

549
00:27:07,310 --> 00:27:08,320
is just the poisonous needle.

550
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:10,320
Of course,

551
00:27:11,770 --> 00:27:13,260
we can't completely rule out

552
00:27:13,290 --> 00:27:14,410
Dugu.

553
00:27:14,530 --> 00:27:16,570
Even if he didn't kill Qinghong,

554
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:17,530
it doesn’t mean

555
00:27:17,550 --> 00:27:20,110
he didn't kill Liu Youqiu.

556
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:24,760
As for the poisonous needle,

557
00:27:25,490 --> 00:27:27,530
I've checked the homicidal dossiers over the years

558
00:27:27,770 --> 00:27:29,350
in Nanzhou,

559
00:27:30,110 --> 00:27:31,780
but it's not recorded.

560
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:33,740
Then I asked the nearby states

561
00:27:33,770 --> 00:27:34,940
to assist our investigation.

562
00:27:35,310 --> 00:27:37,440
We'll find out soon.

563
00:27:39,810 --> 00:27:40,480
Lu Lingfeng hereby

564
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:41,970
thank you for the inculcation.

565
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:47,500
By the way,

566
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,330
when I was in Chang'an,

567
00:27:50,370 --> 00:27:52,290
I lent you some old books.

568
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:53,910
Do you still remember?

569
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:55,240
Of course.

570
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:56,860
Unfortunately,

571
00:27:57,620 --> 00:27:58,960
I was expelled

572
00:27:59,750 --> 00:28:00,780
before I could read it carefully.

573
00:28:01,350 --> 00:28:03,140
And the books were left behind.

574
00:28:03,950 --> 00:28:04,770
It's not your fault.

575
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:07,660
My analysis just now

576
00:28:07,750 --> 00:28:09,530
and the techiniques about autopsy

577
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:11,460
are more or less recorded

578
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:12,560
on those books.

579
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:14,630
If we have the chance to get back to Chang'an,

580
00:28:14,850 --> 00:28:15,530
I hope

581
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:17,890
you can find those books and read carefully.

582
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:20,390
It will be good for you.

583
00:28:24,890 --> 00:28:26,150
What about the case now?

584
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:28,920
Before another new clue shows up,

585
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:30,880
we can only start with Dugu.

586
00:28:31,930 --> 00:28:34,330
I always feel that

587
00:28:34,350 --> 00:28:35,790
he himself didn't know

588
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:36,880
if the things he said were true or not.

589
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:39,160
He seems comfused

590
00:28:39,950 --> 00:28:43,920
about reality and dreams.

591
00:28:56,780 --> 00:28:57,690
Let me ask you.

592
00:28:58,120 --> 00:28:59,510
Are you sleeping or not?

593
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:01,510
I'm concerned that you can't sleep on the floor,

594
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:03,150
so I got you a bed.

595
00:29:03,850 --> 00:29:05,270
But it's been days.

596
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:07,110
You just sit there until dawn.

597
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:08,650
If you don't sleep,

598
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:11,480
I'm afraid you'll find a way to kill yourself,

599
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:13,210
so I dare not close my eyes, either.

600
00:29:16,810 --> 00:29:20,040
I will have nightmares as soon as I close my eyes.

601
00:29:21,970 --> 00:29:22,410
Well...

602
00:29:22,890 --> 00:29:24,270
Don't bother the nightmares.

603
00:29:24,550 --> 00:29:26,280
You're going to die.

604
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:27,840
There's no difference.

605
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:31,660
Minister Lu,

606
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:44,530
I killed them all.

607
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:45,840
Please chop my head.

608
00:29:47,310 --> 00:29:49,190
I don't want to have nightmares anymore.

609
00:29:49,290 --> 00:29:50,850
Please stop making me suffer.

610
00:29:53,430 --> 00:29:55,200
I don't want to have nightmares anymore.

611
00:29:55,820 --> 00:29:58,440
Stop making me suffer.

612
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:07,780
Fed! Fed!

613
00:30:08,610 --> 00:30:09,070
Fed!

614
00:30:16,790 --> 00:30:17,230
Fed!

615
00:30:18,110 --> 00:30:19,140
Fed, wake up.

616
00:30:19,390 --> 00:30:20,090
Wake up.

617
00:30:20,110 --> 00:30:21,280
I have something important to discuss with you.

618
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:21,940
Fed.

619
00:30:26,290 --> 00:30:27,610
Take Chicken Fed to Nanzhou Prison.

620
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:29,040
Lu Lingfeng!

621
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:29,860
You bastard!

622
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:30,140
Go!

623
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:31,330
Behave yourself.

624
00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:32,560
You can't do this to me.

625
00:30:32,950 --> 00:30:34,410
I saved your life.

626
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:37,550
Lu Lingfeng!

627
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:38,900
Lu Lingfeng!

628
00:30:39,990 --> 00:30:40,590
Lu Lingfeng!

629
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:44,880
I have no choice.

630
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:46,690
I'm just following orders.

631
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:49,220
Su Wuming?

632
00:30:50,250 --> 00:30:51,340
I'll have a word with him.

633
00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:53,290
He's just being petty.

634
00:30:54,010 --> 00:30:55,910
He's afraid that I'll spend all his salary on drinking.

635
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:57,710
Commander Su is busy in investigating the case.

636
00:30:57,850 --> 00:30:58,820
He has no time to see you.

637
00:30:59,170 --> 00:31:00,030
Just stay here.

638
00:31:00,550 --> 00:31:01,630
After you drain the alcohol

639
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:02,420
out of your body,

640
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:03,510
I'll pick you up.

641
00:31:04,410 --> 00:31:05,000
Lu Lingfeng.

642
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:05,930
Lu Lingfeng!

643
00:31:07,050 --> 00:31:07,910
You can't leave.

644
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:10,140
You can't do this to your lifesaver.

645
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:12,610
Lu Lingfeng, come back!

646
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:16,040
Lu Lingfeng!

647
00:31:17,310 --> 00:31:18,630
If you want me to quit drinking,

648
00:31:18,730 --> 00:31:20,190
I'd rather die.

649
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:33,700
You are...

650
00:31:37,090 --> 00:31:38,430
I'm a murderer.

651
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:40,130
A convict sentenced to death

652
00:31:41,730 --> 00:31:42,680
You don't look like one.

653
00:31:43,690 --> 00:31:45,170
You look like a scholar.

654
00:31:45,470 --> 00:31:46,130
You are underestimating me.

655
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:50,330
Well...

656
00:31:50,570 --> 00:31:52,060
I'd better stay away from you.

657
00:32:13,490 --> 00:32:14,330
Hey, scholar,

658
00:32:14,850 --> 00:32:18,000
why don't you give me the bed?

659
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:19,740
Why should I?

660
00:32:20,420 --> 00:32:22,020
You're being unreasonable.

661
00:32:22,910 --> 00:32:25,050
You take the bed but don't sleep on it,

662
00:32:25,730 --> 00:32:27,520
and you don't allow others to sleep on it.

663
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:33,680
I'm not a pushover, either.

664
00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:36,190
They bullied me in Commander's residence.

665
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:37,500
Now that I'm here,

666
00:32:37,530 --> 00:32:39,220
I am still bullied by an inferior.

667
00:32:39,990 --> 00:32:41,020
Let me ask you again.

668
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:42,640
Are you sleeping or not?

669
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:45,520
No.

670
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:47,600
Get down if you don't.

671
00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:50,090
Don't touch me!

672
00:32:50,790 --> 00:32:52,160
Don't touch me.

673
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:54,980
He's really fierce.

674
00:32:56,650 --> 00:32:58,290
You really are a murderer.

675
00:32:58,660 --> 00:33:00,380
I thought you lied to me just now.

676
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:12,990
Are you having a headache?

677
00:33:14,670 --> 00:33:15,900
I have nightmares when I close my eyes.

678
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:18,750
If you can stop me from having nightmares,

679
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:20,550
I'll give you the bed.

680
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:23,910
You are giving me a hard time on purpose.

681
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:25,140
Sure I am. So what?

682
00:33:25,610 --> 00:33:26,790
The place is originally for my captivity.

683
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:27,620
It's mine.

684
00:33:27,930 --> 00:33:28,580
You think

685
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:29,510
you are a guest of Commander's residence,

686
00:33:29,670 --> 00:33:30,820
so you can take over the place?

687
00:33:32,130 --> 00:33:33,130
Is that what you think?

688
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:35,630
Interesting.

689
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:41,130
Right.

690
00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:43,820
This is a prison of death row.

691
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:46,630
Even if they want me to quit drinking,

692
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:50,020
they don't need to

693
00:33:50,050 --> 00:33:51,320
lock me up here.

694
00:34:01,330 --> 00:34:02,350
I have no choice.

695
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:04,050
I'm just following orders.

696
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:12,659
Scholar.

697
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:14,980
Here's the thing.

698
00:34:15,340 --> 00:34:16,610
You heard it just now.

699
00:34:18,210 --> 00:34:18,790
I,

700
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:21,370
a distinguished guest of Commander's residence,

701
00:34:21,750 --> 00:34:23,250
if I don't have certain talents,

702
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:25,250
I can't fool them to give me food and drinks

703
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:26,280
in Commander's residence.

704
00:34:26,449 --> 00:34:27,530
Well, not fool them,

705
00:34:27,770 --> 00:34:28,690
persuade them.

706
00:34:29,780 --> 00:34:31,540
To stop you from having nightmares,

707
00:34:31,870 --> 00:34:32,690
is a difficult task

708
00:34:33,170 --> 00:34:34,920
for others.

709
00:34:35,909 --> 00:34:36,860
For me,

710
00:34:37,710 --> 00:34:38,699
it's a piece of cake.

711
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:43,179
W-what do you mean?

712
00:34:43,489 --> 00:34:44,800
Try me if you don't believe it.

713
00:34:46,030 --> 00:34:46,870
Tell me.

714
00:34:47,770 --> 00:34:49,969
Why are you having a nightmare?

715
00:34:51,179 --> 00:34:52,070
It's useless to tell you.

716
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:55,000
You are drunk and sloppy.

717
00:34:55,719 --> 00:34:56,500
I'm sure you can't cure it.

718
00:34:58,770 --> 00:34:59,800
You judge people by their looks.

719
00:35:00,350 --> 00:35:01,870
How did you read the books of sages?

720
00:35:02,630 --> 00:35:02,960
I...

721
00:35:03,850 --> 00:35:04,420
Forget it.

722
00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:05,620
Don't say anything.

723
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:07,580
I won't argue with you for the bed any more.

724
00:35:07,860 --> 00:35:08,990
You try to get some sleep.

725
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:11,340
I'll stand by and watch you closely.

726
00:35:11,950 --> 00:35:13,200
I'll help you find out

727
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:15,800
why you have nightmares. How's that?

728
00:35:16,890 --> 00:35:17,350
I...

729
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:20,750
Watch me while I sleep.

730
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:22,790
You would scare me to death.

731
00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:25,200
You are not afraid to kill someone.

732
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:27,000
Why are you afraid that I watch you sleep?

733
00:35:28,890 --> 00:35:30,270
You said you killed someone.

734
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:32,270
It's a lie, right?

735
00:35:32,710 --> 00:35:34,170
Are you making up the murder thing

736
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:35,970
just for the bed

737
00:35:36,380 --> 00:35:38,570
because you have nowhere to go?

738
00:35:40,710 --> 00:35:41,220
Are you?

739
00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:44,020
Don't underestimate me.

740
00:35:44,650 --> 00:35:45,190
Fine, I'll sleep.

741
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:38,010
Minister Lu，

742
00:36:38,570 --> 00:36:39,170
Chicken Fed

743
00:36:39,340 --> 00:36:40,490
ask for his silver needles for acupuncture.

744
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:41,430
Great.

745
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:42,730
I know where he put them.

746
00:36:42,930 --> 00:36:43,610
I'll get them.

747
00:36:50,070 --> 00:36:53,170
Minister Lu, your idea is so brilliant.

748
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:55,460
It can not only make Chicken Fed

749
00:36:55,490 --> 00:36:57,210
drink less for a few days but also...

750
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:01,890
It looks like

751
00:37:02,660 --> 00:37:03,900
the case will be solved soon.

752
00:37:06,820 --> 00:37:08,550
If it is what I have expected,

753
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:10,390
next,

754
00:37:12,330 --> 00:37:14,090
I will have to trouble you，my sworn sister.

755
00:37:16,650 --> 00:37:17,690
What can I do for you?

756
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:24,110
[Nanzhou Prison]

757
00:37:31,780 --> 00:37:32,980
W-what are you doing?

758
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:40,310
To cure your nightmares.

759
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:41,250
Having nightmares

760
00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:42,950
is a disease for real?

761
00:37:43,550 --> 00:37:46,020
It's up to you whether it is a disease or not.

762
00:37:46,740 --> 00:37:48,060
It's also up to you

763
00:37:48,270 --> 00:37:49,840
whether to cure it or not.

764
00:37:50,490 --> 00:37:51,620
But you have to know,

765
00:37:51,730 --> 00:37:54,290
dreams are like shadow.

766
00:37:54,590 --> 00:37:55,710
Not only the people alive,

767
00:37:56,300 --> 00:37:57,650
but even the dead,

768
00:37:58,180 --> 00:37:59,660
are said to have dreams

769
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:00,500
You...

770
00:38:01,410 --> 00:38:02,230
Don't scare me.

771
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:06,810
Have you ever heard of Boqi?

772
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:10,160
It's also called Dream-eater.

773
00:38:10,590 --> 00:38:12,330
The dream of the dead is its favorite.

774
00:38:12,930 --> 00:38:14,030
If the dreams of the dead

775
00:38:14,450 --> 00:38:16,790
are all eaten by Boqi,

776
00:38:17,330 --> 00:38:19,450
the body will rot immediately.

777
00:38:21,050 --> 00:38:23,260
What you have said is heterodoxy.

778
00:38:25,570 --> 00:38:26,170
Fine.

779
00:38:27,020 --> 00:38:28,540
Let's talk about people alive then.

780
00:38:29,190 --> 00:38:30,030
Among the dreams of people alive,

781
00:38:30,730 --> 00:38:32,740
there are three kinds which are the most strange.

782
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:34,000
The first one is

783
00:38:35,140 --> 00:38:36,730
someone's experience

784
00:38:37,180 --> 00:38:39,120
appears in another person's dream.

785
00:38:39,930 --> 00:38:40,350
Second,

786
00:38:41,340 --> 00:38:43,080
the dreams of two people

787
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:44,970
are connected.

788
00:38:46,290 --> 00:38:46,700
Third,

789
00:38:47,530 --> 00:38:48,270
one person

790
00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:51,340
break into another person's dream.

791
00:38:59,380 --> 00:38:59,880
Why?

792
00:39:01,230 --> 00:39:02,990
Have you experienced this before?

793
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:07,110
You can go on.

794
00:39:10,750 --> 00:39:11,560
Buddhism believes that

795
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:13,710
dreams are thoughts,

796
00:39:14,270 --> 00:39:15,150
memories.

797
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:17,670
They are experiences of the past,

798
00:39:17,890 --> 00:39:20,300
and signs of the future.

799
00:39:21,090 --> 00:39:22,360
But the theory of the Taoism

800
00:39:22,620 --> 00:39:23,880
is more mysterious.

801
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:27,650
It believes the dreams are the evil spirits.

802
00:39:28,220 --> 00:39:28,870
What does it mean?

803
00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:30,300
It means

804
00:39:30,770 --> 00:39:33,010
a person's soul becomes an evil spirit.

805
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:34,540
That is a dream.

806
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:36,800
Of course,

807
00:39:37,550 --> 00:39:39,320
I believe

808
00:39:39,890 --> 00:39:42,410
the sentence more

809
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:43,100
that you dream of what you think.

810
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:44,550
Dream

811
00:39:45,410 --> 00:39:48,480
is the deepest desire in someone's heart.

812
00:39:53,860 --> 00:39:55,270
The deepest desire?

813
00:39:56,340 --> 00:39:57,040
I agree.

814
00:40:00,370 --> 00:40:01,770
People with deficiency of Qi and blood,

815
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:03,700
or people lack of spiritual energy,

816
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:06,190
or people with Liver-qi Stagnation,

817
00:40:06,850 --> 00:40:08,130
are likely to have nightmares.

818
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:11,990
Your case should be the last kind.

819
00:40:16,010 --> 00:40:17,130
You really master medical skill.

820
00:40:19,310 --> 00:40:21,480
Minus eleven years out of my age.

821
00:40:21,980 --> 00:40:23,750
That's how long I have practised medicine.

822
00:40:24,860 --> 00:40:25,880
And this skill of acupuncture.

823
00:40:26,270 --> 00:40:27,490
I learnt it at seven.

824
00:40:28,050 --> 00:40:28,470
Come on.

825
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:33,330
Don't worry.

826
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:35,460
I have learnt acupuncture

827
00:40:36,110 --> 00:40:38,440
from the practices

828
00:40:38,470 --> 00:40:39,420
on my grandfather and mother.

829
00:40:39,810 --> 00:40:41,120
It won't kill you.

830
00:40:41,580 --> 00:40:43,170
It doesn't even hurt.

831
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:44,460
As long as it's done,

832
00:40:44,570 --> 00:40:46,390
I guarantee you a good sleep.

833
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:48,860
No matter it is a Boqi

834
00:40:49,290 --> 00:40:50,340
or a nightmare,

835
00:40:51,070 --> 00:40:52,440
will never come to you.

836
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:56,350
Re...

837
00:40:57,340 --> 00:40:57,870
Really?

838
00:41:08,740 --> 00:41:09,900
In the eight-time acupuncture treatments,

839
00:41:10,180 --> 00:41:12,620
I used more than 100 needles

840
00:41:12,830 --> 00:41:14,250
on his acupoints all over his body.

841
00:41:14,870 --> 00:41:15,700
You can speak

842
00:41:15,730 --> 00:41:16,700
as loudly as you want.

843
00:41:16,820 --> 00:41:17,970
You can never wake him up.

844
00:41:27,970 --> 00:41:31,390
Dugu Xiashu is still young,

845
00:41:31,420 --> 00:41:33,910
and he's not fat or swollen.

846
00:41:33,940 --> 00:41:36,340
How come he become a light sleeper

847
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:38,600
and have nightmares frequently

848
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:40,160
because of respiratory obstruction?

849
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:42,660
That's why you are Commander Su.

850
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:44,760
You're knowledgeable.

851
00:41:45,950 --> 00:41:48,060
But Dugu Xiashu's nightmares

852
00:41:48,610 --> 00:41:50,310
are not simply

853
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:51,290
because of respiratory obstruction.

854
00:41:51,950 --> 00:41:52,300
Then...

855
00:41:52,780 --> 00:41:54,740
Is there any other reasons?

856
00:41:54,830 --> 00:41:56,040
Well...

857
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:58,010
I'm not sure.

858
00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:00,570
Maybe he was frightened

859
00:42:01,100 --> 00:42:03,330
or he's had hysteria since childhood.

860
00:42:03,870 --> 00:42:04,940
Or worse,

861
00:42:05,770 --> 00:42:07,860
if some bad guy used the incense on him,

862
00:42:08,570 --> 00:42:10,240
it could also affect his sleep.

863
00:42:11,220 --> 00:42:12,310
Incense?

864
00:42:19,460 --> 00:42:21,030
Dugu Xiashu has some distant relatives

865
00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:22,670
in Nanzhou.

866
00:42:23,660 --> 00:42:24,750
According to them,

867
00:42:25,370 --> 00:42:27,740
he never had hysteria before.

868
00:42:28,340 --> 00:42:29,420
He was kind

869
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:30,620
and talkative.

870
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:34,160
It has never been heard

871
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:35,640
that he could't sleep well.

872
00:42:36,540 --> 00:42:37,170
Commander Su,

873
00:42:38,420 --> 00:42:39,300
Dugu Xiashu

874
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:40,660
slept for 24 hours.

875
00:42:41,350 --> 00:42:42,350
He didn't have any dreams

876
00:42:42,490 --> 00:42:43,390
during this whole day.

877
00:42:44,060 --> 00:42:45,230
I underestimated Fed before.

878
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:46,480
He is really something.

879
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:48,340
If I'm not mistaken,

880
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:50,600
after Dugu Xiashu woke up,

881
00:42:51,050 --> 00:42:53,430
he couldn't believe that Qinghong was dead,

882
00:42:53,930 --> 00:42:55,120
nor would he admit that

883
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:58,230
he killed his wife and Liu Youqiu.

884
00:42:58,540 --> 00:42:59,330
Commander has a wonderful foresight.

885
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:00,790
He completely overturned

886
00:43:01,150 --> 00:43:02,000
the confession he made before.

887
00:43:11,940 --> 00:43:16,040
♫The storm rises with no reason♫

888
00:43:16,740 --> 00:43:19,120
♫In the night of illusions♫

889
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:22,470
♫I go into the maze♫

890
00:43:24,700 --> 00:43:29,370
♫In a world of prosperity♫

891
00:43:30,510 --> 00:43:32,530
♫A heart burns with obsession♫

892
00:43:33,580 --> 00:43:35,530
♫With the darkness rising♫

893
00:43:36,930 --> 00:43:42,580
♫I can't stop wandering through the night♫

894
00:43:43,340 --> 00:43:49,520
♫With light in my heart, I'm not afraid of the storm♫

895
00:43:49,850 --> 00:43:53,570
♫It's because of justice♫

896
00:43:56,320 --> 00:44:02,180
♫That I seek a truth for this long, lonely night♫

897
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:08,890
♫The heaven and earth are held together by a strong will♫

898
00:44:09,890 --> 00:44:11,690
♫The people are in peace♫

899
00:44:11,910 --> 00:44:16,050
♫Carving right and wrong into a clear heart♫

900
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:17,740
♫The truth♫

901
00:44:18,290 --> 00:44:21,360
♫Will reinterpret this justice♫

902
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:27,520
♫Even if there is a fog♫

903
00:44:28,150 --> 00:44:30,510
♫Even if there are invisible waves♫

904
00:44:32,110 --> 00:44:34,100
♫I'll tell the story of the fate♫

905
00:44:36,190 --> 00:44:40,630
♫Tell the love of the world♫

906
00:44:41,910 --> 00:44:44,110
♫For the memory of grace♫

907
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:47,410
♫And the resentment is not yet over♫

908
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:53,840
♫The rivers and mountains are immortal, the clouds are overturned♫

909
00:44:54,770 --> 00:45:00,980
♫To be consoled by the truth, even with thorns on my back♫

910
00:45:01,300 --> 00:45:05,700
♫Only for justice♫

911
00:45:07,670 --> 00:45:13,950
♫That I seek a truth for this long, lonely night♫

912
00:45:14,220 --> 00:45:20,120
♫The heaven and earth are held together by a strong will♫

913
00:45:21,150 --> 00:45:23,210
♫The people are in peace♫

914
00:45:23,230 --> 00:45:27,660
♫Carving right and wrong into a clear heart♫

915
00:45:28,390 --> 00:45:29,750
♫The truth♫

916
00:45:29,790 --> 00:45:33,510
♫Will reinterpret this justice♫

917
00:45:33,770 --> 00:45:39,870
♫Even if there are a thousand sails, it's not a waste of time♫

918
00:45:40,250 --> 00:45:46,430
♫What I am afraid of is the unrighted wrong♫

919
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:48,960
♫What is the meaning of life and death?♫

920
00:45:49,180 --> 00:45:53,310
♫I'll paint the sunshine into the landscape♫

921
00:45:53,630 --> 00:45:55,350
♫The spirit of righteousness♫

922
00:45:55,560 --> 00:45:58,970
♫Exists for the one I care♫
