[Episode 35]

4
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:48,890
Eagle?

5
00:01:49,330 --> 00:01:49,700
Yes.

6
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:51,190
I thought

7
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:53,030
I was dead.

8
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:54,259
But when I woke up,

9
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,960
it seemed like nothing happened.

10
00:01:58,250 --> 00:01:59,350
I didn't even lose my money.

11
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:06,060
You go to the Ghost Market too often, don't you?

12
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:07,160
That's why you're so scared.

13
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:08,690
I don't know for sure.

14
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:09,900
Alright.

15
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:12,260
The job is almost done.

16
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:12,900
So,

17
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:14,110
what should I buy today?

18
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,100
Wait.

19
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,180
The wonton from the Xiao family.

20
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:26,700
Okay.

21
00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:27,370
Wait.

22
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:28,130
No.

23
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:30,010
It won't be delicious

24
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:31,470
after it is sent to the Ghost Market.

25
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:37,660
How about Zongzi from the Yu family?

26
00:02:38,329 --> 00:02:39,750
Buy one for each flavor.

27

[Tale of Sass]

28
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:49,140
What?

29
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:50,590
You are reading Tale of Sass again.

30
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:53,020
How's it going?

31
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:54,740
Have you found Helan Xue?

32
00:02:55,579 --> 00:02:56,820
In the Resentment Tower in the Ghost Market.

33
00:02:57,870 --> 00:02:59,390
Does Xijun's portrait

34
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:01,070
resemble her?

35
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:02,670
Very similar.

36
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:05,460
Both the color and location of the tear mole

37
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:06,790
are accurate.

38
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:11,690
Wang Yuantong is really good

39
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,000
at describing people.

40
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:15,990
He can even describe so vividly

41
00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:17,190
just through hearsay.

42
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:18,430
So

43
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:20,200
you found Wang Yuantong?

44
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:24,420
He is Nanshan Salouzi.

45
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:26,880
How's his relationship

46
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:28,510
with Detective Di?

47
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:30,530
They were best friends.

48
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:32,390
He resigned

49
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:33,700
because he opposed the Heavenly Empress.

50
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:35,310
Is that true?

51
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:40,440
Why do you say that?

52
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:43,360
You went to Zhongnan Mountain these past few days.

53
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:45,110
I've read this book through

54
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:47,020
carefully.

55
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:49,170
I found that

56
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:51,370
the writer had no objection

57
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:52,850
to the absurd things that the Heavenly Empress did.

58
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:55,510
However, he satirized

59
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,820
your master, Di Renjie, a lot.

60
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:00,420
To be honest,

61
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:04,160
I also noticed that between the lines.

62
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:06,220
But it's strange.

63
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:09,550
I didn't get that impression on the first read.

64
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:11,670
That's because of

65
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:12,910
his literary talent.

66
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:19,100
I have a hypothesis.

67
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:29,960
Could it be like that?

68
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:32,020
What are you talking about?

69
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:35,380
Today is August 13th.

70
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:37,640
We are about to use Helan Xue to lure Sass.

71
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:38,720
Are you sure this will work?

72
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:42,830
No.

73
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:44,220
But I found that

74
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:45,870
we are not the only ones

75
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:47,620
who are focused on Helan Xue.

76
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:48,420
Who else?

77
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:50,420
I'm not sure.

78
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:54,750
But the Administrator of Yongzhou, Du Ming,

79
00:04:55,590 --> 00:04:57,230
seems to be interested

80
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:58,330
in capturing Sass.

81
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,330
And he is quite confident.

82
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:03,710
Du Ming.

83
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:09,300
Twelve years ago,

84
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:11,420
my teacher recommended this person

85
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:12,560
on his sick bed.

86
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:13,860
Du Ming was therefore transferred

87
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:16,110
from Luozhou to Yongzhou,

88
00:05:16,170 --> 00:05:18,010
becoming the Minister of Justice.

89
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:20,850
Twelve years ago?

90
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:22,940
You mean

91
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,670
Detective Di planned

92
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,820
to use Helan Xue to capture Sass as early as 12 years ago

93
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,910
and he even sent Du Ming for this purpose?

94
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,480
Su Wuming.

95
00:05:35,890 --> 00:05:37,050
You are mystifying

96
00:05:37,159 --> 00:05:38,720
your teacher.

97
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:42,900
My teacher once told me

98
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:45,830
although Du Ming was a bit reckless,

99
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:47,680
he was loyal.

100
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:50,220
He's a reliable man.

101
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:52,680
I trust my teacher's judgment.

102
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:56,140
What are you going to do next?

103
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,280
I'm running out of time.

104
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:05,060
The only clue I have now

105
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:07,540
is Helan Xue.

106
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:09,140
I decided

107
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:11,590
to take a risk.

108
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:13,800
Three days ago,

109
00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:15,550
more guests from outside the Ghost Market

110
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:16,810
started to gather in the Resentment Tower.

111
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:19,510
Except those three idiots in Chang'an

112
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:20,820
who were brought by Lu Lingfeng,

113
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:23,210
there were some suspicious people.

114
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:25,330
We don't know their backgrounds.

115
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:30,520
Almost.

116
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:33,340
I have a feeling.

117
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:36,500
It's time

118
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:39,750
for Sass to show up.

119
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:54,940
Just ask your servant

120
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,650
to bring food.

121
00:06:57,220 --> 00:06:58,100
This is not food.

122
00:06:59,090 --> 00:06:59,800
Two days ago,

123
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:01,460
I saw you were running out of rouge.

124
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:03,570
I went to the Elegance Shop of Pingkang Fang

125
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,240
and bought it for you.

126
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:05,420
This has been the latest one in the past two years

127
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:07,060
with new colors and fragrance.

128
00:07:07,290 --> 00:07:08,540
I hope you like it.

129
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:09,490
Elegance Shop.

130
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:11,380
You've really read through

131
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:12,890
the Tale of Sass thoroughly.

132
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:20,860
I haven't seen this rouge before.

133
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:24,730
It's really new.

134
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:26,190
Nowadays, girls in Chang'an

135
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:27,450
like this most.

136
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:29,200
I think this color

137
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,160
suits you.

138
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:31,540
If you put a new huadian

139
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:34,420
on your forehead,

140
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:35,800
one that's with gold foil,

141
00:07:36,170 --> 00:07:37,050
you must be beautiful.

142
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:38,530
Unfortunately,

143
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:40,840
the person I met 20 years ago

144
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:41,580
was not you.

145
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:43,370
Otherwise,

146
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:46,860
I might really have went with you.

147
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,550
You don't belong to the Ghost Market.

148
00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:51,100
It's not late

149
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,200
to go with me.

150
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:55,590
[Sass]

151
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:06,540
...has been punished according to the law of the state.

152
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:18,620
You...

153
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:20,140
What's wrong?

154
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:21,940
Why are you suddenly crying?

155
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:30,560
Mr. Lu,

156
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,419
I'm sorry.

157
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:37,940
Don't mention it.

158
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,710
You are the Lu Lingfeng, Minister of Justice,

159
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,070
on the notice?

160
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:49,750
Sass

161
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,520
is not only the world's best

162
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:52,240
magician,

163
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:54,380
but also the smartest person in the world.

164
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:56,530
If I were an idiot,

165
00:08:56,930 --> 00:08:58,480
I wouldn't have fallen in love with him.

166
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:00,310
I'm Lu Lingfeng.

167
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:01,750
I won't hide anything.

168
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:03,180
Since he's dead,

169
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:04,900
why did you come to me?

170
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:06,640
Don't tell me you met me

171
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:07,720
in the Pingkang Fang when you were 13.

172
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:08,820
I don't believe it.

173
00:09:10,810 --> 00:09:11,750
You are wise.

174
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:13,140
I admire you.

175
00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:15,230
I know you

176
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:16,210
from the Tale of Sass.

177
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:18,820
This book was popular in Chang'an for a while.

178
00:09:19,130 --> 00:09:20,490
I'm worried that after Sass's death,

179
00:09:21,010 --> 00:09:21,990
his enemies

180
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:23,930
will find this place soon.

181
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:25,660
So for your safety,

182
00:09:26,210 --> 00:09:27,340
I advise you to come with me.

183
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:29,060
Leave the Ghost Market.

184
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,160
Find a good person,

185
00:09:31,490 --> 00:09:33,740
or find another way out.

186
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:39,690
You are so nice to me.

187
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:45,900
What if

188
00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:49,500
I follow you?

189
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:02,220
No matter what,

190
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:04,580
you've been

191
00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:06,260
considerate towards me.

192
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:12,030
I've been here

193
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:13,810
for almost three years.

194
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:16,400
I've never left this room.

195
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:22,460
Today,

196
00:10:23,170 --> 00:10:24,490
with such good rouge,

197
00:10:27,770 --> 00:10:30,600
I'm willing to play a song for you

198
00:10:32,570 --> 00:10:35,060
to express my gratitude to you.

199
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,360
Bravo!

200
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:20,900
Bravo! Bravo!

201
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:23,460
Bravo! Bravo!

202
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:37,210
Sorry, Mr. Lu.

203
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:39,250
Tears ruined my makeup.

204
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:41,410
After I refine my makeup,

205
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:43,560
I'll play

206
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:45,740
"Moonlit River In Spring" for you.

207
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:22,360
Administrator, look.

208
00:12:25,650 --> 00:12:26,880
I saw it long ago.

209
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:37,500
Come in.

210
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:38,730
It's okay.

211
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:41,920
So much?

212
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:44,040
I can't finish them alone.

213
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:45,770
Let's eat together.

214
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:56,850
Wooden bird.

215
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:58,460
Administrator Du.

216
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:01,100
This must be Sass.

217
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:03,630
I'll lead a team into the room

218
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:05,040
to capture Sass alive.

219
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:08,560
If he tries to escape,

220
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:10,200
you can shoot him.

221
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:20,090
Save Helan Xue.

222
00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:24,940
Stop!

223
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:01,140
Don't kill me! Don't kill me!

224
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:48,300
Yang Ji!

225
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:49,250
Wake up.

226
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:52,180
Where is Helan Xue?

227
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:03,830
Oh no! Disguising technique!

228
00:15:12,630 --> 00:15:13,460
Helan Xue is missing.

229
00:15:13,570 --> 00:15:14,410
Search every room!

230
00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:52,240
Get on the boat!

231
00:15:53,490 --> 00:15:54,630
Sass! Stop!

232
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:02,380
You go first.

233
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:44,000
That's Sass.

234
00:16:44,030 --> 00:16:45,060
Don't let him escape.

235
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:52,570
Xue.

236
00:16:56,470 --> 00:16:58,180
I know you changed your face.

237
00:16:58,510 --> 00:17:00,200
Don't let them see you.

238
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:02,550
Forget about me. Run!

239
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:10,940
Xue.

240
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:17,930
Shoot!

241
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,160
Sass is good at escaping through water.

242
00:17:28,710 --> 00:17:29,660
I think he has run away.

243
00:17:34,690 --> 00:17:36,250
It's all your fault, you trash!

244
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:37,980
I've been waiting for him

245
00:17:38,010 --> 00:17:39,500
for 12 years according to Detective Di's order.

246
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:41,800
You've ruined all my efforts!

247
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:58,790
She said that we could eat Zongzi together.

248
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:00,630
I didn't know what happened.

249
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:02,660
Suddenly I could only see black.

250
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:03,820
Then,

251
00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:06,920
I passed out.

252
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:08,610
Don't worry.

253
00:18:09,550 --> 00:18:10,250
You are fine.

254
00:18:12,650 --> 00:18:13,280
Get some more sleep.

255
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:16,770
Remember the time when we bought roasted hump?

256
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:20,740
The eagle Yang Ji met

257
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:24,150
was probably a kind of illusionary magic of Sass'.

258
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:28,290
When he woke up, he felt pain on his face.

259
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:30,720
Sass must have done something

260
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:31,620
on his face,

261
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:32,900
and made

262
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:35,390
the human-skin mask

263
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:36,580
to help Helan Xue escape.

264
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:39,820
I know that.

265
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:41,430
But when did Sass

266
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:43,190
send the message

267
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:44,100
to Helan Xue?

268
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:45,780
Even if my men

269
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:46,300
were careless,

270
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:47,580
but Du Ming's men

271
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:49,820
have been watching Helan Xue for 12 years.

272
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:53,460
How come that they didn't notice it at all?

273
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:35,350
Helan Xue knew it clearly

274
00:19:35,710 --> 00:19:37,550
that Sass would pick her up tonight.

275
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:39,570
When she saw

276
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:41,300
the execution announcement of Sass,

277
00:19:43,290 --> 00:19:44,830
she fooled me with tears.

278
00:19:45,270 --> 00:19:45,970
But I...

279
00:19:46,410 --> 00:19:47,670
I was cheated by her.

280
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:52,710
I thought I was wise enough to send Yang Ji.

281
00:19:53,050 --> 00:19:54,610
But on the contrary, Helan Xue took advantage of him

282
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:56,210
to escape from the Resentment Tower.

283
00:19:57,580 --> 00:19:59,450
Du Ming called me trash.

284
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,410
He is totally right.

285
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:07,070
Don't blame yourself.

286
00:20:08,810 --> 00:20:10,440
What I am worried about most now

287
00:20:11,170 --> 00:20:12,510
is that the death of Helan Xue

288
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:15,430
may make Sass crazier.

289
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:18,270
If he does evil in the magic show,

290
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:21,620
the consequences will be unimaginable.

[Butler of Vice Minister Yuwen]

Vice Minister.

293
00:20:40,550 --> 00:20:42,010
The completion celebration

294
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:43,010
of the Sky-scraping Tower will be held tomorrow.

295
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,810
That will be the most glorious day in your life.

296
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:47,790
The new clothes are ready.

297
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:48,940
Please try it on.

[Yuwen Residence]

299
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:47,070
Vice Minister Yuwen.

300
00:21:47,770 --> 00:21:49,890
The Sky-scraping Tower you built

301
00:21:50,130 --> 00:21:51,530
is unparalleled.

302
00:21:52,130 --> 00:21:53,640
How could you pass away

303
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:55,860
before the grand completion celebration?

304
00:21:59,140 --> 00:21:59,700
Don't touch him.

305
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:02,420
Lu Lingfeng.

306
00:22:02,550 --> 00:22:03,710
What are you waiting for?

307
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:05,500
Vice Minister Yuwen died miserably.

308
00:22:05,570 --> 00:22:06,660
Hurry and get the coroner to examine the body.

309
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,410
I'm talking to you.

310
00:22:14,490 --> 00:22:15,360
Why are you in a daze?

Commander Du.

314
00:22:42,210 --> 00:22:42,700
Look.

315
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:45,140
Before Vice Minister Yuwen died,

316
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:46,440
he posed like the Heavenly King Stepping on the Ghost.

317
00:22:46,650 --> 00:22:47,880
Did he want to leave us any message

318
00:22:48,810 --> 00:22:50,440
by this pose?

319
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:55,200
They do look alike.

Yuwen Mukai

and designer of the Sky-scraping Tower.

323
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:01,510
He died at this moment

324
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:04,310
and died in such a strange posture.

325
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:05,820
Administrator Du,

326
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:06,740
what do you think?

327
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:09,380
A few days ago,

328
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:10,920
Yuwen even accompanied me

329
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:12,020
to bring foreign envoys

330
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:13,180
to visit the Sky-scraping Tower.

331
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:15,190
He didn't look sick.

332
00:23:16,650 --> 00:23:18,880
There are no weapons, wounds,

333
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:20,870
or any obvious signs of poisoning,

334
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:22,640
but I think that is what's suspicious.

335
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:25,150
His death, I'm afraid,

336
00:23:25,770 --> 00:23:26,910
is related to the completion celebration

337
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:28,300
of the Sky-scraping Tower.

338
00:23:28,630 --> 00:23:29,030
Yes.

339
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:31,340
Administrator Du,

340
00:23:31,370 --> 00:23:31,990
you must be more familiar with

341
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:33,140
Chang'an than me.

342
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:34,240
Do you remember

343
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:35,910
which temple in Chang' an

344
00:23:36,050 --> 00:23:37,340
has the Statue of the Heavenly King Stepping on the Ghost?

345
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:41,090
The one with his right hand holding the three-story pagoda,

346
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:42,890
and his feet leaning up on the Yaksha ghost -

347
00:23:42,990 --> 00:23:43,770
that Heavenly King.

348
00:23:45,970 --> 00:23:48,000
Leaning up on the Yaksha ghost...

349
00:23:48,330 --> 00:23:50,000
People call him the Heavy-duty Ghost.

350
00:23:55,010 --> 00:23:55,770
Qinglong Temple.

351
00:24:26,490 --> 00:24:27,170
Su Wuming.

352
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:29,400
There are four temples in Chang' an

353
00:24:29,430 --> 00:24:30,340
with this statue.

354
00:24:30,650 --> 00:24:31,570
I've been to all of them.

355
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:33,720
I've searched the statues' bodies,

356
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:34,890
within the pagodas,

357
00:24:35,030 --> 00:24:36,470
and even the top of the statues' heads.

358
00:24:36,750 --> 00:24:37,620
Yet, I couldn't find

359
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:38,940
any useful clue.

360
00:24:39,170 --> 00:24:40,690
What was the result of the autopsy done by the coroner?

361
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:46,170
Yuwen Mukai

362
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:48,060
was murdered in close range with bare hands.

363
00:24:48,330 --> 00:24:49,390
As the body was covered with bruises,

364
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:50,590
the coroner inferred

365
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:52,010
that all of his tendons were broken,

366
00:24:52,150 --> 00:24:54,130
and that it must have been an extremely painful death.

367
00:24:54,850 --> 00:24:56,330
It happened in the early morning,

368
00:24:57,180 --> 00:24:58,230
yet no one in the Yuwen's Residence

369
00:24:58,260 --> 00:24:59,660
discovered it.

370
00:24:59,930 --> 00:25:01,830
This means the murderer was

371
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:02,630
close to Yuwen Mukai.

372
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:04,130
Only in this way could the murderer

373
00:25:04,730 --> 00:25:06,090
enter Yuwen's study directly.

374
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:07,380
Let's go. Take me there.

375
00:25:08,930 --> 00:25:10,290
The corpse is at the government office.

376
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:12,110
You're an official who sneaked into the capital.

377
00:25:12,130 --> 00:25:12,790
Do you have a death wish?

378
00:25:13,210 --> 00:25:14,850
I'm not going to examine the corpse.

379
00:25:14,870 --> 00:25:16,280
Take me to Yuwen's Residence.

380
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:34,920
The body of Mr. Yuwen is

381
00:25:35,290 --> 00:25:36,370
still at the government office.

382
00:25:36,970 --> 00:25:38,080
The empty coffin

383
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:40,100
is at home.

384
00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:42,070
To leave a coffin empty

385
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:43,790
is inauspicious.

386
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:44,730
We know.

387
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:47,090
So, we put Mr. Yuwen's favorite things,

388
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:48,330
when he was alive,

389
00:25:48,650 --> 00:25:49,800
in it.

390
00:25:50,550 --> 00:25:51,750
Forty years ago, Mr. Yuwen,

391
00:25:52,290 --> 00:25:55,340
along with his father,

392
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:57,260
participated in the design of the Sky-scraping Tower.

393
00:25:57,730 --> 00:25:59,020
Even this reconstruction was

394
00:25:59,290 --> 00:26:01,960
specially appointed and supervised by His Majesty.

395
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:06,230
His favorite thing should be

396
00:26:06,890 --> 00:26:08,580
the design drawing of the Sky-scraping Tower.

397
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:09,930
You are right.

398
00:26:10,930 --> 00:26:11,890
Our Mr. Yuwen loved

399
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:13,520
that drawing as much as his life.

400
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:14,400
But His Majesty wanted

401
00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:16,030
to maintain the Sky-scraping Tower's exclusivity,

402
00:26:16,410 --> 00:26:18,140
so he specially sent Chamberlain Feng

403
00:26:19,470 --> 00:26:20,380
to ask Mr. Yuwen to burn them all

404
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:22,580
by hand.

405
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:29,730
Can I see what's inside?

406
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,600
I've traveled all over Chang'an city,

407
00:26:42,130 --> 00:26:43,330
and it turns out you are here.

408
00:26:47,790 --> 00:26:48,960
This was Mr. Yuwen's favorite thing

409
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:50,060
when he was alive.

410
00:26:50,090 --> 00:26:51,740
He always burned incense for it.

411
00:27:03,150 --> 00:27:03,910
What are you doing?

412
00:27:25,890 --> 00:27:27,970
Greetings, Administrator Du.

413
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:30,330
Administrator Su.

414
00:27:30,810 --> 00:27:32,010
Lu Lingfeng already told me everything.

415
00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:34,520
For Detective Di's unsolved case,

416
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:37,570
you, Su Wuming, risked your life to come to the capital.

417
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:40,530
I admire you.

418
00:27:41,290 --> 00:27:41,970
Administrator Du,

419
00:27:42,990 --> 00:27:44,480
in order to fulfill Detective Di's request

420
00:27:44,510 --> 00:27:45,430
he entrusted before he died,

421
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:48,440
you've guarded Helan Xue for 12 years,

422
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:50,590
while continually thinking about capturing Sass.

423
00:27:51,190 --> 00:27:53,250
I admire you so much.

424
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:57,120
Administrator Du,

425
00:27:57,650 --> 00:27:58,660
I was disrespectful to you before.

426
00:27:59,100 --> 00:27:59,700
Please...

427
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:02,040
Let's not talk about the past.

428
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:04,250
Let's talk about this.

429
00:28:08,190 --> 00:28:09,740
Although I know it's important evidence,

430
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:12,540
it is more confusing than the Book of Heaven.

431
00:28:14,170 --> 00:28:14,770
Su Wuming.

432
00:28:15,310 --> 00:28:16,070
Do you understand?

433
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:18,950
This... I don't, either.

434
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:22,460
Well,

435
00:28:23,810 --> 00:28:25,120
we need to find someone who can understand.

436
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:47,290
Here!

437
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:52,040
Old Immortal.

438
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:54,530
I am here to pay a visit to you.

439
00:28:55,510 --> 00:28:56,930
[Feng Tai, descendant of Lu Ban]

440
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:58,400
Greetings, Administrator Du.

441
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:03,470
Lu Lingfeng, Yongzhou's Minister of Justice.

442
00:29:04,690 --> 00:29:06,770
Su Wuming, Administrator of Luozhou.

443
00:29:06,890 --> 00:29:07,890
Greetings, sir.

444
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:09,080
Su Wuming?

445
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:11,570
Could you be that disciple of Detective Di?

446
00:29:13,390 --> 00:29:15,920
Back then, I went along with my teacher, Detective Di,

447
00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:17,430
to visit you, sir.

448
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:19,480
We met once before.

449
00:29:20,350 --> 00:29:21,650
That was not a visit.

450
00:29:21,810 --> 00:29:22,960
Detective Di came to interrogate me

451
00:29:23,210 --> 00:29:24,770
and he was recording a confession on the side.

452
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:26,970
Sir, you have a great memory.

453
00:29:26,990 --> 00:29:27,790
It's my fault.

454
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:29,710
I always like to fiddle with

455
00:29:29,730 --> 00:29:30,420
these playthings.

456
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:31,320
In the end,

457
00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:33,340
as Sass used a mechanical wooden bird to kill people,

458
00:29:33,670 --> 00:29:35,070
Detective Di began to find me suspicious.

459
00:29:36,550 --> 00:29:38,280
What brings you two here today?

460
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:41,760
I want to show you a drawing.

461
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:51,020
This is the structural drawing of the Sky-scraping Tower.

462
00:29:52,450 --> 00:29:53,680
You are indeed an old immortal,

463
00:29:53,970 --> 00:29:54,980
for you recognized it at a glance.

464
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:55,630
Don't praise me.

465
00:29:56,470 --> 00:29:58,600
I saw this drawing a year ago.

466
00:29:59,170 --> 00:30:00,530
Where did you see it?

467
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:01,920
Yuwen Mukai brought it here

468
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:03,140
and asked me to check it.

469
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:05,030
Can you tell us in detail?

470
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:06,480
What exactly happened?

471
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,040
When Queen Wei was in power,

472
00:30:10,470 --> 00:30:12,040
wasn't the Sky-scraping Tower built

473
00:30:12,690 --> 00:30:14,490
to the 18th floor?

474
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:16,560
One year ago, His Majesty ordered

475
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:17,980
that more floors should be built,

476
00:30:18,350 --> 00:30:19,770
under the princess' direct supervision.

477
00:30:20,090 --> 00:30:21,620
But Yuwen Mukai couldn't build them,

478
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:23,120
so he came to me with this drawing

479
00:30:23,410 --> 00:30:24,660
to ask for ideas.

480
00:30:25,290 --> 00:30:27,130
Why couldn't he build more floors?

481
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:30,680
The 33 floors

482
00:30:31,070 --> 00:30:31,790
represent

483
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:34,260
the Heaven of 33 in Buddhism.

484
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:36,140
But the work of construction is not so simple;

485
00:30:36,430 --> 00:30:37,700
it is not as if you can

486
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:38,820
realize everything you desire.

487
00:30:40,230 --> 00:30:41,540
But this was an order from His Majesty.

488
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:42,730
If you can't build it higher,

489
00:30:42,770 --> 00:30:44,180
won't you be beheaded?

490
00:30:44,790 --> 00:30:47,160
Actually, His Majesty knew it was a difficult task.

491
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:49,440
But in order to enable Tang

492
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:50,650
to be the only dynasty under the Heavens

493
00:30:50,810 --> 00:30:52,290
to possess this one-and-only tall building,

494
00:30:52,630 --> 00:30:53,460
risks had to be taken.

495
00:30:54,330 --> 00:30:56,410
I recall that Yuwen Mukai

496
00:30:56,450 --> 00:30:57,690
even brought a friend that day.

497
00:30:58,100 --> 00:30:59,580
It is said that he was a minor official.

498
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:01,250
He was also here to give advice.

499
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:03,080
He was very courageous.

500
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:05,980
But the idea he came up with

501
00:31:07,310 --> 00:31:07,980
was kind of dangerous.

502
00:31:08,570 --> 00:31:09,680
How is it dangerous?

503
00:31:10,990 --> 00:31:12,950
Right here.

504
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:17,960
The 18th floor is

505
00:31:18,310 --> 00:31:20,740
the lethal point of the building.

506
00:31:29,130 --> 00:31:30,020
The friend you just mentioned,

507
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:31,160
the friend who gave advice,

508
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:32,460
how old was he?

509
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:33,540
What was his position?

510
00:31:33,650 --> 00:31:34,210
What's his name?

511
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:36,180
I can't remember his name.

512
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:37,660
I forgot his official position too.

513
00:31:38,650 --> 00:31:41,240
He seemed to be a trusted aide of His Majesty.

514
00:31:54,170 --> 00:31:54,880
Assistant Minister?

515
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:56,050
Assistant Minister!

516
00:31:57,330 --> 00:31:58,320
What's wrong, Assistant Minister?

517
00:31:59,130 --> 00:31:59,620
My foot.

518
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:01,200
My... my ankle is sprained.

519
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:03,200
Hurry. Get a doctor.

520
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:08,450
Doctor,

521
00:32:08,930 --> 00:32:09,540
how is it?

522
00:32:11,150 --> 00:32:12,360
The bone is cracked.

523
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:14,060
As the saying goes, "If one's tendons or bones are hurt, one needs a long time to heal."

524
00:32:15,530 --> 00:32:17,330
Assistant Minister, I'm afraid you can't walk

525
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:18,150
for a few months.

526
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:22,300
Please.

527
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:31,740
All the officials are fighting for a chance to see

528
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:34,390
the completion celebration of the Sky-scraping Tower,

529
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:36,390
but there are not many available seats.

530
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:38,780
His Majesty is exceptionally merciful

531
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:40,780
that he invites me specifically.

532
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:43,290
But how can I be

533
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:44,500
so disappointing?

534
00:32:45,170 --> 00:32:45,740
Hurry up,

535
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:48,140
head to the Imperial Secretariat's Residence and report the news.

536
00:32:48,370 --> 00:32:49,170
Report my leave of absence.

537
00:32:49,810 --> 00:32:51,980
Don't let His Majesty blame me.

538
00:32:52,370 --> 00:32:52,810
Yes.

539
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:02,730
Father,

540
00:33:03,790 --> 00:33:05,510
you sprained your ankle while walking at home.

541
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:07,160
You must be distracted.

542
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:11,840
Xijun, you are smart.

543
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:14,720
Do you have any worry in your mind?

544
00:33:15,780 --> 00:33:16,850
It's not something in particular.

545
00:33:17,770 --> 00:33:18,710
I'm just panicked.

546
00:33:19,090 --> 00:33:21,290
Because Sass has not been caught,

547
00:33:21,590 --> 00:33:23,020
you fear something bad might happen in the magic show.

548
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:26,780
Yuwen Mukai suffered a sudden death at home yesterday.

549
00:33:27,530 --> 00:33:28,400
He was the designer and supervisor

550
00:33:28,430 --> 00:33:29,710
of the Sky-scraping Tower.

551
00:33:31,060 --> 00:33:32,350
Tonight's Chang'an

552
00:33:33,820 --> 00:33:35,220
makes me uneasy.

553
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:36,720
I understand.

554
00:33:37,670 --> 00:33:38,790
The Sky-scraping Tower is dangerous.

555
00:33:39,550 --> 00:33:40,990
Father, you purposely sprained your ankle to avoid going there.

556
00:33:42,010 --> 00:33:43,090
But Lu Lingfeng and Su Wuming

557
00:33:43,110 --> 00:33:43,710
have gone there.

558
00:33:44,290 --> 00:33:45,500
-I have to warn them. -Stop right there!

559
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:47,810
Su Wuming went back to Chang'an?

560
00:33:49,930 --> 00:33:50,690
I see.

561
00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:52,540
He came back

562
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:55,040
because of Sass.

563
00:33:55,970 --> 00:33:58,050
But he's not Di Renjie after all.

564
00:33:59,130 --> 00:34:00,490
If Detective Di was still alive,

565
00:34:01,290 --> 00:34:02,780
he should be able to turn things around.

566
00:34:04,540 --> 00:34:05,080
Xijun,

567
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:06,700
come here.

568
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:13,420
Xijun.

569
00:34:14,130 --> 00:34:15,139
After tonight,

570
00:34:16,270 --> 00:34:19,090
there will be a startling transformation in Chang'an.

571
00:34:19,989 --> 00:34:22,270
Your father, I, might...

572
00:34:24,610 --> 00:34:25,570
or...

573
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:28,790
You are my only daughter.

574
00:34:29,370 --> 00:34:31,010
I want you to stay by my side.

575
00:34:31,469 --> 00:34:33,350
Don't go anywhere, okay?

576
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:36,360
But Lu Lingfeng...

577
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:38,070
As I said the last time,

578
00:34:38,250 --> 00:34:40,080
Lu Lingfeng is in the center of the chaos.

579
00:34:40,670 --> 00:34:41,739
Even if you go now,

580
00:34:42,070 --> 00:34:43,500
you won't be able to enter the Sky-scraping Tower,

581
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:45,139
nor will you be able to see Lu Lingfeng.

582
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:47,139
Stay with your father,

583
00:34:48,210 --> 00:34:49,139
I beg you.

584
00:35:02,420 --> 00:35:04,780
Is there any progress on Lu Lingfeng's end?

585
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:06,150
Your Highness,

586
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:07,240
no.

587
00:35:09,550 --> 00:35:10,640
In four hours,

588
00:35:11,910 --> 00:35:13,620
it will be the completion celebration of the Sky-scraping Tower.

589
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:15,920
Sass hasn't been caught.

590
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:17,910
What if

591
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:20,010
he wreaks havoc during the magic show?

592
00:35:20,510 --> 00:35:21,140
Didn't His Highness

593
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:22,500
enter the palace early in the morning?

594
00:35:22,780 --> 00:35:24,100
But His Majesty won't listen to dissuasion,

595
00:35:24,770 --> 00:35:25,820
so there's nothing we can do.

596
00:35:26,370 --> 00:35:27,680
Before His Majesty ascended the throne,

597
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:29,820
he has suffered too much.

598
00:35:30,290 --> 00:35:31,480
He was often in danger,

599
00:35:31,670 --> 00:35:32,960
with death threatening at all times.

600
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:35,810
He could only relax temporarily

601
00:35:36,210 --> 00:35:37,490
when watching the magic show.

602
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:40,550
Now that the country is prosperous and peaceful,

603
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:42,880
it is reasonable that His Majesty

604
00:35:42,910 --> 00:35:43,620
wants to restore

605
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:45,410
the magic show.

606
00:35:46,210 --> 00:35:47,650
Dare I, Bai Shan, persuade Your Highness

607
00:35:48,130 --> 00:35:50,430
to find an excuse not to go to the Sky-scraping Tower

608
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:52,050
so as to avoid the danger?

609
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:53,100
How can I do that?

610
00:35:54,690 --> 00:35:55,670
If I can't dissuade His Majesty from going,

611
00:35:56,180 --> 00:35:57,600
then I must stay by his side.

612
00:35:58,500 --> 00:35:59,150
Moreover,

613
00:35:59,470 --> 00:36:01,330
my aunt, the ministers and the people will be there.

614
00:36:01,540 --> 00:36:02,580
As the Crown Prince,

615
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:04,300
I must be with everyone.

616
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:06,660
Look!

617
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:10,420
It's so high.

618
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:16,230
How many floors?

619
00:37:27,390 --> 00:37:30,340
The completion celebration of the Sky-scraping Tower

620
00:37:30,890 --> 00:37:32,670
begins!

621
00:37:32,970 --> 00:37:38,510
Bravo!

622
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:42,400
The full moon is in the sky tonight.

623
00:37:42,620 --> 00:37:44,050
It's the Mid-Autumn Festival.

624
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:47,300
The 33-floor Sky-scraping Tower is completed.

625
00:37:47,740 --> 00:37:49,940
It can be said that things are realized smoothly like the roundness of the moon.

626
00:37:50,140 --> 00:37:52,610
More so, it's a grand occasion in Chang'an.

627
00:37:53,140 --> 00:37:55,780
A grand occasion brings worldwide prosperity.

628
00:37:56,140 --> 00:37:57,290
The majestic tall tower

629
00:37:57,420 --> 00:37:58,900
peaks the bright moon alone.

630
00:37:59,290 --> 00:38:00,850
Let our Great Tang

631
00:38:01,270 --> 00:38:03,960
prosper endlessly for generations!

632
00:38:06,750 --> 00:38:09,730
Long live my Emperor!

633
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:11,650
Long live His Majesty!

634
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:14,410
Rise.

635
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:21,720
Today, the Sky-scraping Tower is successfully completed.

636
00:38:22,290 --> 00:38:23,980
All countries have sent their congratulations.

637
00:38:24,650 --> 00:38:26,410
Also, there are odd and extraordinary people

638
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:27,910
who will perform various specialty acts

639
00:38:28,090 --> 00:38:29,380
to congratulate the prosperity of Tang.

640
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:30,990
The magic show

641
00:38:31,780 --> 00:38:34,810
begins!

642
00:39:18,450 --> 00:39:20,060
Great!

643
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:22,140
Bravo!

644
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:23,860
Are those cherries in the air

645
00:39:24,330 --> 00:39:24,930
edible?

646
00:39:43,410 --> 00:39:43,940
Your Majesty.

647
00:39:46,710 --> 00:39:47,320
Your Majesty.

648
00:39:47,930 --> 00:39:48,770
Although the magic is clever,

649
00:39:49,050 --> 00:39:49,890
you can't believe it.

650
00:39:51,670 --> 00:39:52,920
There's no harm in trying it.

651
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:02,860
It's delicious.

652
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:04,680
Give some to the Crown Prince and the Princess.

653
00:40:04,710 --> 00:40:05,950
Let them have a taste.

654
00:40:06,350 --> 00:40:06,880
Yes.

655
00:40:26,850 --> 00:40:29,430
Here, give some to the people of Chang'an.

656
00:40:40,460 --> 00:40:41,140
Reward him with silver.

657
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:42,870
Thank you, Your Majesty.

658
00:40:58,950 --> 00:40:59,510
Your Majesty.

659
00:41:00,150 --> 00:41:01,440
The cherries in the air just now

660
00:41:01,580 --> 00:41:02,850
were just a small trick.

661
00:41:03,580 --> 00:41:05,270
I can crawl into an inch-sized box

662
00:41:05,650 --> 00:41:06,880
and then come out as a bird.

663
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:28,900
This person...

664
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:30,550
Where did she go?

665
00:41:30,580 --> 00:41:31,190
She's gone.

666
00:42:05,060 --> 00:42:05,660
Good.

667
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:06,740
Reward her with silver.

668
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:09,030
Bravo!

669
00:42:09,130 --> 00:42:09,700
Amazing!

670
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:10,580
Let's go!

671
00:42:10,630 --> 00:42:11,070
Great!

672
00:42:11,460 --> 00:42:16,060
Bravo!

673
00:42:19,420 --> 00:42:20,290
Lu Lingfeng,

674
00:42:21,340 --> 00:42:23,060
what do you think?

675
00:42:24,460 --> 00:42:25,550
Understand the law and adapt to the change

676
00:42:26,570 --> 00:42:27,780
according to the specific situation.

677
00:42:28,010 --> 00:42:29,910
It's called transformation and illusion.

678
00:42:30,810 --> 00:42:32,690
As His Highness just said,

679
00:42:33,950 --> 00:42:34,870
magic is clever,

680
00:42:35,340 --> 00:42:36,300
but you shouldn't believe it.

681
00:42:37,210 --> 00:42:38,940
You talk about the Crown Prince everytime you speak.

682
00:42:40,180 --> 00:42:42,250
Why are you protecting me here instead?

683
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:44,020
Your Highness, it's an honor

684
00:42:44,540 --> 00:42:45,700
to watch the event with you.

685
00:42:46,250 --> 00:42:47,570
What do you mean protection?

686
00:42:48,130 --> 00:42:49,840
Don't think I don't know.

687
00:42:50,740 --> 00:42:52,420
The real Sass hasn't been caught yet.

688
00:42:53,550 --> 00:42:55,270
You're worried about my safety.

689
00:42:55,610 --> 00:42:56,910
That's why you're standing here.

690
00:43:10,350 --> 00:43:14,460
♫The storm rises with no reason♫

691
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:17,540
♫In the night of illusions♫

692
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:20,910
♫I go into the maze♫

693
00:43:23,070 --> 00:43:27,740
♫In a world of prosperity♫

694
00:43:28,900 --> 00:43:30,910
♫A heart burns with obsession♫

695
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:33,830
♫With the darkness rising♫

696
00:43:35,300 --> 00:43:40,760
♫I can't stop wandering through the night♫

697
00:43:41,790 --> 00:43:47,960
♫With light in my heart, I'm not afraid of the storm♫

698
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:52,040
♫It's because of justice♫

699
00:43:54,790 --> 00:44:00,660
♫That I seek a truth for this long, lonely night♫

700
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:07,290
♫The heaven and earth are held together by a strong will♫

701
00:44:08,270 --> 00:44:10,050
♫The people are in peace♫

702
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:14,440
♫Carving right and wrong into a clear heart♫

703
00:44:14,870 --> 00:44:16,090
♫The truth♫

704
00:44:16,710 --> 00:44:19,780
♫Will reinterpret this justice♫

705
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:25,930
♫Even if there is fog♫

706
00:44:26,580 --> 00:44:28,940
♫Even if there are invisible waves♫

707
00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:32,520
♫I'll tell the story of the fate♫

708
00:44:34,620 --> 00:44:39,060
♫Tell the love of the world♫

709
00:44:40,340 --> 00:44:42,540
♫For the memory of grace♫

710
00:44:43,470 --> 00:44:45,830
♫And the resentment is not yet over♫

711
00:44:46,780 --> 00:44:52,220
♫The rivers and mountains are immortal, the clouds are overturned♫

712
00:44:53,190 --> 00:44:59,380
♫To be consoled by the truth, even with thorns on my back♫

713
00:44:59,710 --> 00:45:04,110
♫Only for justice♫

714
00:45:06,090 --> 00:45:12,370
♫That I seek a truth for this long, lonely night♫

715
00:45:12,620 --> 00:45:18,500
♫The heaven and earth are held together by a strong will♫

716
00:45:19,610 --> 00:45:21,670
♫The people are in peace♫

717
00:45:21,700 --> 00:45:26,130
♫Carving right and wrong into a clear heart♫

718
00:45:26,820 --> 00:45:28,190
♫The truth♫

719
00:45:28,220 --> 00:45:31,950
♫Will reinterpret this justice♫

720
00:45:32,180 --> 00:45:38,290
♫Even if there are a thousand sails, it's not a waste of time♫

721
00:45:38,650 --> 00:45:44,830
♫What I am afraid of is the unrighted wrong♫

722
00:45:45,450 --> 00:45:47,360
♫What is the meaning of life and death?♫

723
00:45:47,650 --> 00:45:51,790
♫I'll paint the sunshine into the landscape♫

724
00:45:52,050 --> 00:45:53,760
♫The spirit of righteousness♫

725
00:45:53,910 --> 00:45:57,890
♫Exists for the one I care♫
