to quit drinking,

there are no ghosts or gods in this world?

Yes.

that there was really a god in Ninghu.

38

Of course we need to have a curtain separating us from Tuo God.

I don't think he did it to fight against us,

111
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:43,310
he just doesn't know how powerful the Worshippers of Tuo God is.

112

But since he has arrived at Ninghu,

what should we do to him

Why did the Worshippers of Tuo God come to you?

132
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:29,510
The officials in Ninghu

133
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:30,740
are mostly related to the Worshippers of Tuo God.

134
00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:32,809
It's normal that you don't trust me.

135
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:35,340
According to their previous style of work,

136
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:36,760
I believe that Governor Li's death

137
00:08:36,789 --> 00:08:37,840
is definitely related to them.

138
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:38,900
It was even clearer

139
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:39,780
when they tried to attack you secretly this time.

140
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:41,549
Miss Ying Tao,

141
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:43,210
although you haven't been in Ninghu for long,

142
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:45,380
I believe that Governor Li

143
00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:46,470
had told you

144
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:47,410
about the Worshippers of Tuo God.

145
00:08:48,450 --> 00:08:49,290
And they tried their best

146
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,410
to kill Governor Li.

147
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:52,980
Why?

148
00:08:57,570 --> 00:08:59,010
I'm the Minister of Justice of Ninghu.

149
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:01,330
I'm investigating this matter.

150
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,520
You should trust me.

151
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:11,620
I won't force you

152
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:14,150
if you don't want to tell.

153
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,270
But looking at the situation now,

154
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:18,140
I advise you to stay here for the time being,

155
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:19,280
and don't go out.

156
00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:21,480
You should not go to keep vigil for Governor Li as well.

157
00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:23,220
It's too dangerous.

158
00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:28,090
Who is so bold

159
00:09:29,230 --> 00:09:30,650
to ruin our plan?

160
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:32,370
His face was covered

161
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:33,890
and we couldn't see clearly.

162
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:35,270
Covered?

163
00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:46,680
Could it be

164
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:48,820
someone we know?

165
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:03,810
Banquets have never end

00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:06,150
in Ninghu,

167
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:08,470
along with singing and dancing everywhere.

168
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:10,540
But

169
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:13,340
the people can't even decide

170
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:14,670
what to drink.

171
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:18,760
How pathetic.

172
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:22,030
The banquet today was specially

173
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:24,210
held to welcome Commander,

174
00:10:27,010 --> 00:10:30,330
but are you trying to imply something?

175
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:32,200
Commander,

176
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,810
you are right.

177
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:38,790
Being an official in Ninghu

178
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:42,010
is unfair.

179
00:10:43,130 --> 00:10:43,840
Minister Zeng,

180
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:45,100
are you drunk?

181
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:45,960
No.

182
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:48,440
The Nantian Wine.

183
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:51,970
I used to drink it every day,

184
00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:56,590
but now it has became the Tuo God Wine.

185
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:58,460
I can never drink it again.

186
00:10:58,620 --> 00:10:59,170
Tell me,

187
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:03,220
what's the point of being an official?

188
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:04,890
That's boring.

189
00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:06,590
But Minister Zeng,

190
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,020
with the Worshippers of Tuo God,

191
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:10,620
even if you are

192
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:12,390
in the office once for seven days,

193
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:14,790
everything will still go smoothly.

194
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:16,300
What else do you want?

195
00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:18,990
If I can drink the Tuo God Wine every day,

196
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,990
so what if I'm busy every day?

197
00:11:23,230 --> 00:11:23,670
Well...

198
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:26,660
Administrator,

199
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:29,290
do you and the former Prefectural Governor really dare to

200
00:11:29,450 --> 00:11:31,630
hand over the important matters

201
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:33,610
to the Worshippers of Tuo God?

202
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,670
Commander has just arrived.

203
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:37,660
It's normal for you to have such doubts.

204
00:11:39,050 --> 00:11:40,580
In a few months,

205
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:44,570
your doubts will be cleared up.

206
00:11:47,090 --> 00:11:48,030
I hope so.

207
00:11:49,570 --> 00:11:50,860
Please enjoy.

208
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:53,710
I'm leaving.

209
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:54,960
Commander Su,

210
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:56,810
where are you going?

211
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:01,920
I'm going to keep vigil for Prefectural Governor Li.

212
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:18,120
[Bishui Pavilion]

213
00:12:42,030 --> 00:12:42,540
Father,

214
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:46,790
I will avenge you.

215
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:23,010
Who?

216
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:27,460
Who are you?

217
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:29,510
How dare you play tricks here?

218
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,110
Come out!

219
00:13:30,650 --> 00:13:31,260
Let me tell you.

220
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:34,410
I am Detective Di's disciple.

221
00:13:46,010 --> 00:13:46,560
Father,

222
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:51,640
I know you can't rest in peace

223
00:13:52,010 --> 00:13:53,220
because you were assassinated

224
00:13:54,850 --> 00:13:56,760
even you were the Prefectural Governor.

225
00:13:58,980 --> 00:13:59,530
But,

226
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:04,240
please don't scare me.

227
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:10,840
Miss.

228
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:12,530
You're awake.

229
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:16,140
How dare you! What are you doing?

230
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:19,680
This is your sword. Take it back.

231
00:14:21,090 --> 00:14:23,360
I'm the new Military Commander of Ninghu.

232
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:25,540
I heard that Governor Li

233
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:28,200
was diligent in his work.

234
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:30,360
I admire him very much.

235
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:33,500
I'm here to keep vigil for him.

236
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:35,220
The moment I entered,

237
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:37,170
I saw you fainted.

238
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:40,260
I didn't expect that we would meet again

239
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:41,950
in this way.

240
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:49,920
It's you.

241
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:52,610
You're not a thief

242
00:14:53,770 --> 00:14:55,290
nor a teacher,

243
00:14:57,070 --> 00:14:57,930
but a Military Commander.

244
00:15:00,570 --> 00:15:02,020
I didn't expect

245
00:15:03,210 --> 00:15:06,260
you are Governor Li's daughter.

246
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:10,430
You ruined my plan that night.

247
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:13,020
Even if you came to keep vigil for my father,

248
00:15:13,410 --> 00:15:14,250
it won't help.

249
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:15,740
What do you mean?

250
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:17,040
You don't need to know.

251
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:22,890
As the Military Commander of Ninghu,

252
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:24,790
I will urge the Minister of Justice

253
00:15:24,850 --> 00:15:26,350
to solve this case as soon as possible

254
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:28,390
and clear your father's name.

255
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:29,610
Forget it.

256
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:31,750
All the officials in Ninghu

257
00:15:32,730 --> 00:15:34,590
are connected to the Worshippers of Tuo God.

258
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:37,470
Even if you're new here,

259
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:40,460
I don't believe you.

260
00:15:42,430 --> 00:15:43,680
Did you mean that

261
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:46,830
Governor Li was killed by the Worshippers of Tuo God?

262
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:48,810
Do you have any evidence?

263
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:50,640
No evidence is needed.

264
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:53,580
My father couldn't rest in peace.

265
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:55,850
I just saw his ghost.

266
00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:06,170
Who is there?

267
00:16:14,050 --> 00:16:15,040
Uncle Si, don't worry.

268
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:15,820
I'm fine.

269
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:16,850
You may leave.

270
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:31,910
He said

271
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:34,820
he was packing my father's remains.

272
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:39,760
You just said

273
00:16:40,170 --> 00:16:41,770
you saw Governor Li.

274
00:16:42,610 --> 00:16:45,890
I think you were hallucinating

275
00:16:46,390 --> 00:16:47,640
for missing your father too much.

276
00:17:17,210 --> 00:17:18,190
Give it to me.

277
00:17:18,450 --> 00:17:19,390
What is it?

278
00:17:20,569 --> 00:17:21,780
The Records of Worshippers of Tuo God.

279
00:17:24,190 --> 00:17:25,589
I don't know what you're talking about.

280
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:27,500
If you don't hand it over,

281
00:17:28,450 --> 00:17:29,300
Fine.

282
00:17:36,730 --> 00:17:37,810
Who are you?

283
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:39,100
How despicable!

284
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,690
Do you know who I am?

285
00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:41,890
You?

286
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:43,540
A dead man.

287
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:53,830
Lu Lingfeng?

288
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,350
Wait, Miss.

289
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:17,810
Why are you stopping me?

290
00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:20,010
We can't kill him.

291
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:21,740
If we kill him, we won't know

292
00:18:21,770 --> 00:18:22,810
where is he from.

293
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:26,540
Tell me.

294
00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:28,910
Are you from the Worshippers of Tuo God?

295
00:18:29,790 --> 00:18:31,300
We were paid by our client to

296
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,040
get the Records of Worshippers of Tuo God

297
00:18:33,210 --> 00:18:34,280
from you.

298
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:36,260
For the real identity of our client,

299
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:38,280
we really don't know.

300
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:40,650
The Records of Worshippers of Tuo God?

301
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:42,520
Even if you're not the members of the Worshippers of Tuo God,

302
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:44,690
you should die too.

303
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:46,940
Lu Lingfeng!

304
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:48,020
-Stop her! Stop her! -Please spare my life.

305
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:07,970
Lu Lingfeng, what's wrong?

306
00:19:18,810 --> 00:19:19,250
Stop!

307
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:21,690
Do you think you can simply rip my clothes?

308
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,030
Lu Lingfeng.

309
00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:11,870
Thank you for saving my life.

310
00:20:13,910 --> 00:20:15,910
It's not the first time,

311
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,210
stop thanking me.

312
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,110
The women just now

313
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:25,420
isn't Governor Li's daughter.

314
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:28,840
She should be a killer.

315
00:20:31,170 --> 00:20:31,630
Here.

316
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:33,940
Forget about her.

317
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:37,970
Let's talk about you.

318
00:20:38,530 --> 00:20:40,110
When did you come to Ninghu?

319
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:43,330
That night,

320
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:46,980
when I was going back to Commander's Residence from the Lin Inn,

321
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,270
I felt

322
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:49,500
someone following me,

323
00:20:49,890 --> 00:20:51,510
and he didn't mean anything bad.

324
00:20:52,010 --> 00:20:53,090
I thought

325
00:20:53,870 --> 00:20:56,340
if you were back,

326
00:20:56,910 --> 00:20:58,120
that would be great.

327
00:20:58,660 --> 00:20:59,500
I didn't expect

328
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:01,860
it's really you.

329
00:21:03,230 --> 00:21:04,940
Are you too lonely

330
00:21:05,050 --> 00:21:06,400
wandering around the world,

331
00:21:06,770 --> 00:21:07,710
and miss Xijun

332
00:21:08,730 --> 00:21:09,810
and us?

333
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,330
I just think that as a scholar,

334
00:21:16,890 --> 00:21:18,660
you will not do well in Ninghu at first.

335
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:20,590
So I came to see you.

336
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:24,160
But I didn't expect that

337
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:27,350
Ninghu is so strange.

338
00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:30,670
The entire city from the officials to the commoner,

339
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,060
are fear of the Tuo God.

340
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:37,220
Su Wuming.

341
00:21:39,790 --> 00:21:40,810
did you worship

342
00:21:41,290 --> 00:21:42,410
the alligator demon?

343
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:43,860
Not yet.

344
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:45,210
But very soon.

345
00:21:45,650 --> 00:21:46,310
You...

346
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:49,990
People told me

347
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:53,080
not to talk about the Tuo God in Ninghu.

348
00:21:53,210 --> 00:21:55,110
You'll lose your life. Be careful.

349
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:58,670
Can you get up?

350
00:21:59,270 --> 00:21:59,990
Since no one is here,

351
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:02,420
I need to do another autopsy.

352
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:04,460
Come on.

353
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:05,750
Lu Lingfeng.

354
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:07,290
Look at his left hand.

355
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:13,230
There's a callus here.

356
00:22:13,990 --> 00:22:15,160
Instead of  writing,

357
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:17,480
he should get his callus for holding a sword for years.

358
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:20,600
A swordsman with his left hand holding sword?

359
00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:22,060
It's not strange.

360
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,130
Many martial artists

361
00:22:23,710 --> 00:22:25,330
are practicing left-handed swords

362
00:22:25,950 --> 00:22:26,870
to surprise their enemies.

363
00:22:27,470 --> 00:22:28,270
It seems that

364
00:22:28,810 --> 00:22:30,890
the victim is not Governor Li.

365
00:22:31,890 --> 00:22:33,170
We can't jump to conclusions.

366
00:22:33,430 --> 00:22:35,310
You and I have never met Governor Li.

367
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:36,980
How do you know he can't fight?

368
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:43,910
Lu Lingfeng.

369
00:22:44,570 --> 00:22:45,590
Look at the back of his hand.

370
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:49,530
A birthmark!

371
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:16,220
Su Wuming!

372
00:23:16,540 --> 00:23:17,020
Look at this!

373
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:29,980
It looks like something

374
00:23:30,010 --> 00:23:32,190
for women's makeup.

375
00:23:33,390 --> 00:23:34,420
Failed?

376
00:23:35,170 --> 00:23:36,870
Where did you hire those two losers?

377
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:38,720
Chief Shen, calm down.

378
00:23:38,990 --> 00:23:40,330
Both of them are capable.

379
00:23:40,610 --> 00:23:41,460
They have never

380
00:23:41,490 --> 00:23:42,290
failed before.

381
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:44,480
Li Yu's daughter is not difficult to deal with.

382
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:45,920
But we didn't expect

383
00:23:46,030 --> 00:23:47,260
that the new Military Commander

384
00:23:47,290 --> 00:23:48,520
would also be in the mourning hall.

385
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:50,310
Su Wuming?

386
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:51,420
Yes.

387
00:23:51,890 --> 00:23:53,080
He's just a scholar.

388
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:54,000
You can just

389
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:54,610
kill him too!

390
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:56,540
He is a scholar.

391
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:58,040
But he has a subordinate,

392
00:23:58,310 --> 00:23:59,300
who is quite powerful.

393
00:23:59,810 --> 00:24:01,000
He has other subordinates?

394
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:04,530
Why have I never heard of it before?

395
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:07,180
Where are those two?

396
00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:09,710
One died in the mourning hall,

397
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:11,830
and the other one I've already...

398
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,500
That's more like it.

399
00:24:21,230 --> 00:24:22,060
Take some men

400
00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:23,960
to the Chamber of Commerce and take Lu Yong to me.

401
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:25,900
Lu Yong?

402
00:24:27,350 --> 00:24:29,490
He's very wary of us.

403
00:24:30,030 --> 00:24:32,590
I'm afraid it's hard to catch him.

404
00:24:32,910 --> 00:24:33,860
In Ninghu,

405
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:35,950
there are disciples of the Tuo God everywhere.

406
00:24:36,310 --> 00:24:37,380
What's the use of his wary?

407
00:24:42,150 --> 00:24:42,970
This is his place.

408
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:44,600
Don't bother talking when you see him.

409
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:45,830
Just tie him up and bring him to me.

410
00:24:46,870 --> 00:24:47,670
Yes!

411
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:54,500
Greetings, Administrator Gu.

412
00:24:56,330 --> 00:24:57,820
Minister Zeng is also here.

413
00:24:59,490 --> 00:25:00,870
Commander Su,

414
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:02,570
you didn't sleep at all last night?

415
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:06,790
I ran into ghosts when I was keeping vigil last night.

416
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:08,140
How can I fall asleep after that?

417
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:11,160
Commander Su,

418
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:13,850
do you really believe that there are ghosts in this world?

419
00:25:14,410 --> 00:25:16,060
I didn't believe it before.

420
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:18,070
But after I arrived at Ninghu,

421
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:19,760
I became more and more convinced.

422
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:21,330
Therefore,

423
00:25:21,870 --> 00:25:24,390
Administrator Gu, please allow me

424
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:26,440
to help the Minister of Justice to catch ghosts.

425
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:28,090
Catch ghosts?

426
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:29,120
Administrator!

427
00:25:29,930 --> 00:25:30,570
Administrator!

428
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:33,380
Administrator,

429
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:34,980
Cheif Shen of the Worshippers of Tuo God wishes to see you.

430
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:36,970
Please, let him in.

431
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:42,710
Chief Shen.

432
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:44,560
Administrator.

433
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:46,820
The murderer who killed the prefectural governor

434
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:47,720
has been caught by me.

435
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:49,690
I'll leave him to you.

436
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:51,040
Mr. Lu?

437
00:25:53,170 --> 00:25:55,010
Did you mean that Mr. Lu

438
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:56,650
is the murderer of the prefectural governor?

439
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:58,510
What evidence do you have?

440
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:03,550
Lu Yong.

441
00:26:04,690 --> 00:26:06,180
Who did you invite to the Yaoyue Restaurant

442
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:08,310
before Prefectural Governor Li was killed?

443
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:13,850
After it's done,

444
00:26:15,070 --> 00:26:15,950
you will get one more.

445
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:17,150
Who do you want to kill?

446
00:26:18,050 --> 00:26:18,650
Just say the name.

447
00:26:19,390 --> 00:26:20,330
That's not right.

448
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:23,870
The coroner has examined the body.

449
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:26,370
Judging from the wound on his neck,

450
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:28,090
Governor Li

451
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:30,200
was indeed devoured by the giant alligator.

452
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:31,290
But now you're saying that

453
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:33,810
there was an assassin?

454
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:35,730
Commander Su,

455
00:26:36,850 --> 00:26:38,500
do you believe the coroner's words

456
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:41,080
or the murderer's confession?

457
00:26:46,170 --> 00:26:47,040
It was me who sent someone

458
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:49,020
to kill that bastard, Li Yu.

459
00:26:49,930 --> 00:26:51,010
Now that I've succeeded,

460
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:52,230
I have nothing to hide.

461
00:26:53,180 --> 00:26:54,290
I only want a quick death.

462
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:57,140
See? Did I force him?

463
00:26:57,460 --> 00:26:58,340
How dare you, Lu Yong!

464
00:26:59,110 --> 00:27:00,910
How dare you kill the prefectural governor of the city?

465
00:27:01,550 --> 00:27:03,590
Li Yu and the Worshippers of Tuo God collaborated in evildoing!

466
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:04,740
He deserved to die.

467
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:05,730
How dare you!

468
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:07,740
Guards, put him on the death row!

469
00:27:07,990 --> 00:27:08,510
-Yes. -Yes.

470
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:09,350
Gu Wenbin.

471
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:10,890
Where is the Records I gave you?

472
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:14,430
Are you in cahoots

473
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:15,160
with them too?

474
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:22,470
What records?

475
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:23,930
I don't know what you're talking about!

476
00:27:25,090 --> 00:27:25,620
Take him away.

477
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:27,190
Gu Wenbin!

478
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:29,980
I trusted you as an imperial official!

479
00:27:30,330 --> 00:27:32,240
I hoped that you could help the people of Ninghu!

480
00:27:32,830 --> 00:27:35,760
I was so wrong! You'll be damned!

481
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:38,450
All of you will be damned!

482
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:42,950
Chief Shen.

483
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:44,870
Thank you.

484
00:27:45,660 --> 00:27:47,040
Since the case is solved,

485
00:27:47,370 --> 00:27:48,730
Chief Shen,

486
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:50,430
do you want to stay for a drink tonight?

487
00:27:52,410 --> 00:27:54,510
I have to bring my people to collect taxes.

488
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:56,770
I don't have the time for a feast here.

489
00:27:57,740 --> 00:27:58,220
Goodbye!

490
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:08,610
I'm really in a trance for now.

491
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:12,500
I can't even tell who is the official.

492
00:28:17,130 --> 00:28:17,960
Commander Su,

493
00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:21,570
you don't need to worry about it.

494
00:28:22,510 --> 00:28:24,210
It is fine as long as

495
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:25,830
there are people who are willing to do the job,

496
00:28:26,490 --> 00:28:27,150
and getting the job well done.

497
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:29,650
Commander Su and Minister Zeng,

498
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:31,260
do you want to stay for a drink?

499
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:34,730
Administrator Gu, I have a question.

500
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:38,380
What did Mr. Lu mean

501
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:39,880
about the Records?

502
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:44,940
I have no contact with him.

503
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,990
He's just barking nonsense.

504
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:49,720
Administrator!

505
00:28:50,550 --> 00:28:51,070
Administrator!

506
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:52,720
I heard that people from the Worshippers of Tuo God

507
00:28:52,750 --> 00:28:53,470
arrested Lu Yong.

508
00:28:54,890 --> 00:28:55,810
Minister He, you are here.

509
00:28:56,690 --> 00:28:57,460
Good news.

510
00:28:58,380 --> 00:28:59,600
Lu Yong has admitted that

511
00:28:59,650 --> 00:29:00,870
it was him who sent an assassin

512
00:29:01,090 --> 00:29:02,270
to kill Governor Li.

513
00:29:03,110 --> 00:29:04,420
Now that the case is solved,

514
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:05,320
Minister He,

515
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:07,080
stay for a celebration.

516
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:08,550
Celebration?

517
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:10,460
There's nothing to celebrate!

518
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:13,270
Lu Yong sent someone to assassinate the prefectural governor?

519
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:15,580
It doesn't match

520
00:29:15,610 --> 00:29:16,480
the autopsy result at all.

521
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:19,070
Besides, when I was investigating the case,

522
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:20,830
I found out that Governor Li

523
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:22,030
had joined the Worshippers of Tuo God when he was alive.

524
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:26,170
So!

525
00:29:27,210 --> 00:29:29,130
Since he had joined the group,

526
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:31,600
why would he be bitten to death by the alligator?

527
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:34,500
The fact that Lu Yong hired an assassin

528
00:29:34,530 --> 00:29:35,570
is more believable.

529
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:37,870
What do you think, Commander Su?

530
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:42,210
Arresting criminal,

531
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:44,850
the Worshippers of Tuo God has done it for the city.

532
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:46,810
The request I made just now is to

533
00:29:47,050 --> 00:29:50,900
assist the Minister of Justice in catching ghosts.

534
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:53,980
May I have your permission?

535
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:57,460
Before I became a commander,

536
00:29:57,660 --> 00:29:59,170
I had always been a sheriff.

537
00:29:59,510 --> 00:30:00,710
I dealt with criminal cases a lot,

538
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:02,730
which more or less gave me some experience.

539
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:04,430
Whatever. Do whatever you want.

540
00:30:05,010 --> 00:30:06,180
Thank you, Administrator.

541
00:30:06,950 --> 00:30:08,630
I see! Today's banquet

542
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:10,480
is not going to happen!

543
00:30:16,370 --> 00:30:17,290
Commander Su,

544
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:21,560
do you think there are ghosts in Ninghu?

545
00:30:22,490 --> 00:30:23,800
What do you think?

546
00:30:25,250 --> 00:30:27,150
I think that

547
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:29,900
you can't believe about their presence,

548
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:33,140
but you also can't believe about their absence.

549
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:36,690
Minister Zeng is so wise.

550
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:43,050
[Ninghu Prison]

551
00:30:40,690 --> 00:30:41,160
Please.

552
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:45,390
This is it, Commander.

553
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:47,100
You may leave.

554
00:30:47,190 --> 00:30:47,620
Yes.

555
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:54,170
Lu Yong.

556
00:30:55,060 --> 00:30:56,820
I'm the new Military Commander of Ninghu,

557
00:30:56,850 --> 00:30:57,600
Su Wuming.

558
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:59,070
Cut the crap.

559
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:00,050
OK.

560
00:31:00,610 --> 00:31:01,860
I'll cut to the chase.

561
00:31:02,190 --> 00:31:03,580
Let me ask you a few questions.

562
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:06,050
You just need to answer yes or no.

563
00:31:08,130 --> 00:31:09,890
Is the assassin you sent

564
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:11,960
a left-hander?

565
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:16,820
How did you know?

566
00:31:16,930 --> 00:31:17,890
I just said,

567
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,400
you just need to answer yes or no.

568
00:31:23,410 --> 00:31:23,840
Yes.

569
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:25,820
Xiao Qi is

570
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:27,300
a famous left-handed swordsman.

571
00:31:27,930 --> 00:31:28,920
Second question.

572
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:31,740
He didn't come back

573
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:34,090
for the rest of the money, right?

574
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:38,660
Yes.

575
00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:40,220
Third question.

576
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:42,540
There is a birthmark

577
00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:43,630
on that swordsman's left hand.

578
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:44,720
Is it true or not?

579
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:49,020
But your target

580
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:50,010
is not an ordinary person.

581
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:51,340
After this,

582
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:53,800
you have to give me three more silver ingots.

583
00:31:54,810 --> 00:31:55,630
Deal.

584
00:32:03,430 --> 00:32:03,900
Yes.

585
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:05,640
There is a birthmark.

586
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:07,260
It's red.

587
00:32:11,790 --> 00:32:12,560
I see.

588
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:14,690
Lu Yong.

589
00:32:15,050 --> 00:32:16,530
You may not die.

590
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:18,840
I mean,

591
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:21,470
from the perspective of the law of Tang.

592
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:23,700
But if someone from the Worshippers of Tuo God wants to kill you,

593
00:32:23,730 --> 00:32:24,910
I have no way to save you.

594
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:25,480
So,

595
00:32:26,190 --> 00:32:27,850
you must show

596
00:32:27,870 --> 00:32:29,750
your determination to die soon.

597
00:32:29,790 --> 00:32:30,320
That way,

598
00:32:31,050 --> 00:32:32,740
you'll be safer here.

599
00:32:35,290 --> 00:32:36,580
Why should I trust you?

600
00:32:40,130 --> 00:32:41,330
Because only I

601
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:42,980
can save you.

602
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:56,840
The headless corpse in the mansion is that assassin.

603
00:32:56,870 --> 00:32:57,460
I agree with that.

604
00:32:58,860 --> 00:33:00,420
But how can you be sure

605
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:01,430
that Governor Li is still in the mansion?

606
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:03,710
That's because I suddenly remembered

607
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:05,110
Yingtao said that

608
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:06,980
she saw her father's ghost

609
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:08,410
appeared.

610
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:09,900
There are no ghosts in this world.

611
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:12,310
It must be the Prefectural Governor himself.

612
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:13,300
Are you that sure?

613
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:14,620
That's because...

614
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:16,330
I saw

615
00:33:16,330 --> 00:33:17,340
a figure too.

616
00:33:30,130 --> 00:33:30,540
Tell me.

617
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:32,550
Where is the Prefectural Governor?

618
00:33:37,470 --> 00:33:38,590
Don't bother with him.

619
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:40,590
He's a mute.

620
00:33:43,710 --> 00:33:44,560
Why do I feel that

621
00:33:45,060 --> 00:33:46,100
he can hear me?

622
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:50,290
Li Si,

623
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:52,790
you weren't born deaf-mute,

624
00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:54,340
but mute later.

625
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:56,210
So you can hear us,

626
00:33:56,230 --> 00:33:56,880
right?

627
00:33:59,220 --> 00:33:59,950
Tell me.

628
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:01,680
Where is Li Yu?

629
00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:05,020
I'm the new Military Commander here.

630
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:06,670
I'm not in a same group

631
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:08,420
with the Worshippers of Tuo God

632
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:09,300
who wanted to kill Governor Li.

633
00:34:09,639 --> 00:34:10,840
You should trust me.

634
00:34:17,699 --> 00:34:18,340
Stop pretending.

635
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:20,159
If Li Yu is not here,

636
00:34:20,659 --> 00:34:22,320
why are you bringing food in here?

637
00:34:36,179 --> 00:34:36,820
Li Si.

638
00:34:37,710 --> 00:34:40,199
I know you are a loyal servant.

639
00:34:41,139 --> 00:34:42,500
But what you did

640
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:45,130
put your master's safety

641
00:34:45,370 --> 00:34:46,280
at risk.

642
00:34:47,270 --> 00:34:47,960
You!

643
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:48,980
If you still won't tell us,

644
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:51,290
don't blame me for being ruthless.

645
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:30,060
Alligator!

646
00:35:38,350 --> 00:35:39,150
Lu Lingfeng.

647
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:40,800
According to the Book of Things,

648
00:35:41,050 --> 00:35:42,710
it has sharp hearing.

649
00:35:42,860 --> 00:35:44,560
You can distract it with noises.

650
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:03,820
Couple of days ago, I was just thinking

651
00:36:04,470 --> 00:36:06,020
if Lu Lingfeng came to Ninghu,

652
00:36:06,050 --> 00:36:06,810
it would be great.

653
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:09,220
With his hot temper,

654
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,310
how could he stand aside

655
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:12,220
and see me

656
00:36:12,260 --> 00:36:13,620
not having a sip of the Tuo God Wine?

657
00:36:14,580 --> 00:36:16,620
I didn't expect that when he is here,

658
00:36:17,580 --> 00:36:20,340
he almost died in the alligator's claw.

659
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:22,460
Why are you so full of crap!

660
00:36:23,170 --> 00:36:24,000
You said that

661
00:36:24,510 --> 00:36:25,950
it was Lu Yong who hired Xiao Qi

662
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:26,820
to assassinate in the mansion.

663
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:30,240
The latter was accidentally killed by the giant alligator.

664
00:36:31,780 --> 00:36:33,800
But why did Li Yu

665
00:36:34,130 --> 00:36:36,340
put his official robe on the assassin?

666
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:38,630
There is only one explanation.

667
00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:41,420
Li Yu knew that

668
00:36:41,690 --> 00:36:43,700
he is in great danger.

669
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:44,790
In order to survive,

670
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:47,160
he made use of this assassination.

671
00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:48,960
But didn't he already

672
00:36:48,980 --> 00:36:50,070
join the Worshippers of Tuo God？

673
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:52,100
Joining it

674
00:36:52,350 --> 00:36:53,580
doesn't mean

675
00:36:53,740 --> 00:36:55,220
he won't be a threat

676
00:36:55,250 --> 00:36:56,250
to them.

677
00:36:56,540 --> 00:36:57,900
It also doesn't mean

678
00:36:58,190 --> 00:37:00,970
he will be safe.

679
00:37:01,970 --> 00:37:03,870
Have you forgotten those two assassins?

680
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:06,170
They forced Yingtao

681
00:37:06,190 --> 00:37:07,520
to hand over the Records of Worshippers of Tuo God.

682
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:09,930
You mean...

683
00:37:10,370 --> 00:37:11,170
I guess

684
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:13,490
the Records of Worshippers of Tuo God

685
00:37:13,660 --> 00:37:15,260
was written by Li Yu.

686
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:16,880
How can you be sure of that?

687
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:18,770
We have to find Yingtao.

688
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:20,540
I think you are

689
00:37:20,580 --> 00:37:21,900
interested in that girl.

690
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:22,860
Nonsense!

691
00:37:23,530 --> 00:37:24,940
She's the daughter of the prefectural governor

692
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:26,260
and is being hunted down.

693
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:27,570
I'm an official in Ninghu.

694
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:29,160
It's my duty to protect her.

695
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:30,850
She even knows how to use the ecstasy incense.

696
00:37:31,660 --> 00:37:33,100
Does she really need protection from you, a weak scholar?

697
00:37:33,570 --> 00:37:33,930
You!

698
00:37:34,070 --> 00:37:35,120
I have always

699
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:36,620
doubted her identity.

700
00:37:37,060 --> 00:37:38,600
Maybe her identity of the daughter of the prefectural governor

701
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:40,360
is fake.

702
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:42,500
If so,

703
00:37:43,050 --> 00:37:44,100
she should have

704
00:37:44,140 --> 00:37:45,200
ran away from Ninghu as soon as possible.

705
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:49,300
We'll know tomorrow

706
00:37:49,330 --> 00:37:50,680
whether she is an imposter or not.

707
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:51,260
Tomorrow?

708
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:52,540
Yes.

709
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:54,700
The notice has been posted in the city.

710
00:37:54,890 --> 00:37:56,900
They will bury Governor Li tomorrow.

711
00:37:57,090 --> 00:37:58,260
If Yingtao comes,

712
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:00,080
she is the daughter of the Governor Li.

713
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:02,440
If she doesn't come, she's not.

714
00:38:03,650 --> 00:38:04,790
This is a chance.

715
00:38:05,450 --> 00:38:06,250
What chance?

716
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:09,910
A chance to see Yingtao.

717
00:38:10,620 --> 00:38:12,590
That's for you, an official in Ninghu.

718
00:38:13,070 --> 00:38:13,660
For me,

719
00:38:14,430 --> 00:38:15,740
I have another plan.

720
00:38:17,710 --> 00:38:18,590
Where are you going?

721
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:21,220
I've been here for days,

722
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:22,920
and I already have another place to stay.

723
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:26,230
Why don't you live in the Commander's Residence?

724
00:38:26,350 --> 00:38:26,990
Yes.

725
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:29,040
Isn't it good

726
00:38:29,060 --> 00:38:29,720
to continue to be your personal staff?

727
00:38:30,370 --> 00:38:32,910
At least he provides food and wine for you.

728
00:38:37,180 --> 00:38:39,520
Although Su Wuming is a bit stingy...

729
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:40,820
I, Lu Lingfeng,

730
00:38:40,820 --> 00:38:41,860
live in the world,

731
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:43,140
not only for the food and wine.

732
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:45,410
It also depends on what type of wine and food.

733
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:47,980
For example,

734
00:38:48,250 --> 00:38:49,370
the Tuo God Wine!

735
00:38:50,290 --> 00:38:51,220
I think

736
00:38:51,370 --> 00:38:54,070
he's just afraid of seeing Xijun.

737
00:38:56,780 --> 00:38:58,970
What he said is not out of some heroic spirit,

738
00:39:00,330 --> 00:39:01,620
he is just a coward.

739
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:03,210
I'm doing it for the people and myself.

740
00:39:04,230 --> 00:39:05,680
And I don't need a burden

741
00:39:07,020 --> 00:39:08,020
when I wander around the world in the future.

742
00:39:09,740 --> 00:39:10,330
She

743
00:39:12,740 --> 00:39:13,940
doesn't have to suffer

744
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:16,030
with me.

745
00:39:47,580 --> 00:39:48,290
I heard

746
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:51,560
what you said.

747
00:39:53,660 --> 00:39:54,720
You did it for me.

748
00:39:57,820 --> 00:39:58,460
At first,

749
00:40:00,050 --> 00:40:01,220
I can't live

750
00:40:03,580 --> 00:40:04,810
in this world

751
00:40:04,850 --> 00:40:06,240
without you.

752
00:40:07,670 --> 00:40:08,800
Now I've found it.

753
00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:11,330
And,

754
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:13,620
you left me

755
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:16,220
for my own good.

756
00:40:17,340 --> 00:40:19,160
It's enough for me to know that we have each other in our hearts.

757
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:21,150
Go.

758
00:40:22,660 --> 00:40:26,630
I will never pester you again.

759
00:41:02,430 --> 00:41:04,160
In my opinion,

760
00:41:04,620 --> 00:41:06,380
after today,

761
00:41:06,620 --> 00:41:08,160
he will no longer be

762
00:41:08,180 --> 00:41:09,820
that young boy of Chang'an anymore.

763
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:11,380
But you,

764
00:41:11,730 --> 00:41:14,380
you're still that young boy,

765
00:41:14,950 --> 00:41:16,090
Handsome Fed.

766
00:41:16,210 --> 00:41:16,920
What do you mean?

767
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:18,700
Eavesdropping on the lovers' talks,

768
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:21,300
isn't it something only a kid would do?

769
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:21,910
I...

770
00:41:24,250 --> 00:41:24,780
Master!

771
00:41:28,190 --> 00:41:29,740
I didn't see anything.

772
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:31,570
Master. My lady.

773
00:41:31,940 --> 00:41:33,150
C-Carry on.

774
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:37,090
My disciple, turn around.

775
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:39,300
I dare not.

776
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:41,160
It's not that I dare not.

777
00:41:41,780 --> 00:41:42,390
It's that I shouldn't.

778
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:44,450
I came at a bad time.

779
00:41:44,870 --> 00:41:46,310
My lady misses you so much.

780
00:41:47,090 --> 00:41:47,920
Finally, you two...

781
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:49,960
But it was interrupted by me.

782
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:51,600
Xue Huan deserves the punishment.

783
00:41:51,660 --> 00:41:52,150
Enough.

784
00:41:52,690 --> 00:41:53,860
I tell you to turn around.

785
00:41:54,170 --> 00:41:54,700
Otherwise,

786
00:41:55,340 --> 00:41:56,030
you'll be expelled!

787
00:42:10,930 --> 00:42:11,410
Xue Huan,

788
00:42:12,250 --> 00:42:12,950
I'm not leaving.

789
00:42:14,610 --> 00:42:15,830
I'm exhausted

790
00:42:16,330 --> 00:42:16,880
from the fight with that giant alligator earlier.

791
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:18,800
I will now punish you

792
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:19,880
to boil some water for my feet

793
00:42:20,340 --> 00:42:20,930
to relieve my fatigue.

794
00:42:21,220 --> 00:42:21,630
Yes.

795
00:42:22,010 --> 00:42:22,730
I accept my punishment.

796
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:40,410
