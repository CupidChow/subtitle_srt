00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,100
Magistrate Yuan.

5
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:49,020
I heard that you

6
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:51,509
went to the Ghost Market last night to crack the murder case.

7
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:54,289
I've been worried sick.

8
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:55,990
What do you mean by that?

9
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:56,789
What?

10
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,600
That's untrue?

11
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:05,990
I did take the liberty

12
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:08,259
of sending 19 county guards

13
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:09,380
to assist the Imperial Guards.

14
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,820
I'll accept any punishment.

15
00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:13,860
It's not your fault.

16
00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:16,940
Lu Lingfeng is deeply trusted by His Highness.

17
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:19,290
You had no choice but to give him what he asked.

18
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:22,060
I saw those guards.

19
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:23,240
All breathing.

20
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:25,570
I'm worried about you.

21
00:02:27,579 --> 00:02:28,240
Me?

22
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:31,740
I drank too much last night

23
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:32,840
and went to bed early.

24
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:34,220
Did something go wrong?

25
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:35,380
You can't fool me.

26
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:38,090
All the constables in Chang'an County

27
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:39,810
were sent out last night.

28
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:42,900
So I came here to check on you,

29
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,540
but you were nowhere to be found.

30
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:47,410
Did you lead the guards

31
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,710
to the Ghost Market?

32
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:51,560
Wuming,

33
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:54,320
you're like a brother to me.

34
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:56,030
Why can't you be honest with me?

35
00:02:57,990 --> 00:02:59,370
I really wish I could.

36
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:03,290
It's just that I visited the Ghost Market twice

37
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:05,520
but made no progress at all

38
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:06,980
and nearly died there.

39
00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:07,980
I'm too ashamed

40
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:10,170
to tell you that.

41
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:12,790
I've been the magistrate of Chang'an for many years.

42
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:15,310
All the six sheriffs working for me,

43
00:03:16,079 --> 00:03:17,350
except for Wu Daqi,

44
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,870
have been promoted.

45
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:21,270
But in terms of talent and courage,

46
00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:22,260
you're better than any of them.

47
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:24,570
You came to the capital

48
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:26,410
on the recommendation of the princess.

49
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:28,329
Risking you life in investigations

50
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,560
and doing all the work yourself,

51
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:31,890
you will definitely achieve great accomplishments.

52
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:34,930
It'll be my honor to be in your favor when that day comes.

53
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:37,940
Stop kidding me.

54
00:03:38,329 --> 00:03:40,260
I will always stand by your side

55
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:42,290
and be at your service.

56
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:01,020
Lucky me.

57
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,330
If you'd started snoring any earlier,

58
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:04,140
I'd have been even more embarrassed.

59
00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:05,830
He's gone?

60
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:09,030
I told you to let me go,

61
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:10,780
but you insisted that I stay.

62
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:12,570
Now you're blaming me for snoring.

63
00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:13,680
Cut the crap.

64
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,250
Get your ass up.

65
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:17,250
We're going to visit the government official of the West Market.

Mr. Kang went on patrol.

69
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:33,880
I go fetch him.

70
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:34,909
No need.

71
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:36,409
I'll wait for him inside.

72
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:38,840
Sheriff Su.

73
00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:41,500
Fed.

74
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:53,110
Sheriff Su, why don't you

75
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:54,170
wait in the hall?

76
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:55,570
You can't be here.

77
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,200
Tsk, the backyard is very beautiful.

78
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,930
Mr. Kang grew those flowers himself?

79
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:01,640
Yes.

80
00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:02,770
Sheriff Su,

81
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:03,610
come with me

82
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:04,790
to wait in the hall.

83
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:05,550
This place…

84
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:06,530
This place is perfect.

85
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:08,210
I love flowers.

86
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:17,240
It smells so good.

87
00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:19,680
So refreshing.

89
00:05:22,730 --> 00:05:23,560
is made of this kind of flower.

90
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:25,720
Are you sure?

91
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:26,550
You don't trust me?

92
00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:27,280
I...

93
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:28,340
I do.

94
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:31,980
But that day when I mentioned

95
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:34,130
the Soul Returning Incense with Mr. Kang, he...

96
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:35,590
He was playing dumb.

97
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:37,810
He can do that again.

98
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:39,700
After all, we have no proof.

99
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:42,030
Mr. Kang will never admit it.

100
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:43,590
That's easy.

101
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:45,750
Take some flowers back with you.

102
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:47,440
I'll make the incense out of them.

103
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:52,290
Why did you

104
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:53,400
bring the guests here?

105
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:54,950
Mr. Kang, I...

106
00:05:57,940 --> 00:05:59,460
Don't blame him, Mr. Kang.

107
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:02,690
The air smells so good here.

108
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:04,200
I followed the fragrance here.

109
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:06,030
What can I do for you, Sheriff Su?

110
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:09,310
You were of great help that day.

111
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:10,500
I came today

112
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:12,680
to express my gratitude.

113
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:14,020
You're welcome.

114
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:14,760
Let's go inside.

115
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:15,790
This is not the place for talking.

116
00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:17,610
Mr. Kang,

117
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:19,830
those flowers smell so good.

118
00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:20,750
I haven't seen

119
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:21,940
this kind of flower before.

120
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:24,050
Could you kindly give me some of them?

121
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:26,380
These flowers are planted here

122
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:28,010
but I don't own them.

123
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:29,500
I can't give them to you.

124
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:31,690
Who's the big shot owning these flowers?

125
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:33,490
Can't believe he made a government official take care of his flowers.

126
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:34,909
He's a businessman.

127
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:37,020
You don't know him.

128
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:37,780
Let's go.

129
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:45,180
We're both public servants

130

working in Chang'an.

131
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:48,180
Hope we can…

Mr. Kang!

133
00:06:50,409 --> 00:06:50,790
Mr. Kang.

134
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:51,990
Mr. Kang.

135
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:55,920
Mr. Kang.

136
00:06:56,170 --> 00:06:57,360
We caught a thief stealing flowers.

137
00:06:57,380 --> 00:06:57,820
What?

138
00:06:57,860 --> 00:06:58,580
Go.

139
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:00,780
You...

140
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:02,330
Let go of me.

141
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,190
Su Wuming.

142
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:04,420
You're not here to thank me.

143
00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:05,670
You came to steal flowers.

144
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:07,420
Guards! Beat this thief!

145
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:08,910
Hold on.

146
00:07:09,850 --> 00:07:10,410
Mr. Kang,

147
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:11,540
calm down.

148
00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:13,410
He's not a thief.

149
00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:16,350
Well…

150
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:18,550
He stole the flowers

151
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:19,540
once I looked away.

152
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:20,700
He is a thief.

153
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:21,680
He just saw

154
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:23,870
how much I love those flowers

155
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:25,620
and wanted to get some for me.

156
00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:27,180
No need to explain, Sheriff Su.

157
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,130
Beat him!

158
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:29,100
Beat him!

159
00:07:30,370 --> 00:07:31,080
Are you serious?

160
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:36,580
Stop!

161
00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:47,440
Mr. Kang.

162
00:07:48,330 --> 00:07:49,260
He's my man.

163
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:50,800
Release him.

164
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:58,250
Kang Yuanli,

165
00:07:58,970 --> 00:08:00,430
are you defying the General of the Imperial Guards?

166
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:02,800
I don't dare.

167
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,030
General Lu.

168
00:08:14,290 --> 00:08:16,010
You came to my rescue in time.

169
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:17,750
I thought I could never

170
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:18,540
eat chicken again.

171
00:08:18,890 --> 00:08:19,600
Su Wuming...

172
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:20,160
Shut up!

173
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:26,170
General.

174
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:33,220
Beautiful flowers.

175
00:08:34,789 --> 00:08:35,330
Mr. Kang,

176
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:37,270
give them to me.

177
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:52,630
He cut, ground,

178
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:53,760
and burned the flowers.

179
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:55,050
He's taking this place as his workshop.

180
00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:02,150
Come in.

181
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:06,910
Take a sniff.

182
00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:24,630
They smell the same.

183
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,070
They are the same thing.

184
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:30,030
The red cloth

185
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:32,040
was once drenched in this fragrance.

186
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:33,900
Giving me more time,

187
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,290
I can make it even better.

188
00:09:35,930 --> 00:09:37,250
If any of you dies,

189
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:38,950
smear this incense on your body

190
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:40,480
and you won't rot for months.

191
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:41,680
Clear?

192
00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:43,470
You're welcome. I'm leaving.

193
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:45,540
Wait a moment, sir.

194
00:09:45,890 --> 00:09:47,250
You suffered just now.

195
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:49,070
I apologize to you.

196
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:50,890
Save it, Sheriff Su.

197
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:52,260
Nothing good happens to me

198
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:53,670
when I'm with you.

199
00:09:53,950 --> 00:09:55,310
Let's not see each other again.

200
00:09:58,790 --> 00:09:59,410
General.

201
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:00,790
Later,

202
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:01,970
I'll change your dressing again.

203
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:02,860
Then I'll bid you farewell.

204
00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:05,950
I can live longer

205
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:07,060
in the Ghost Market.

206
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:08,750
Living in the Ghost Market all this time,

207
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:10,200
how do you know

208
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:12,730
the Soul Returning Incense

209
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:14,840
is made of the flowers Kang Yuanli grew?

210
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:17,680
The businessman he mentioned

211
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,470
is no one but Yin Shilang.

212
00:10:20,810 --> 00:10:22,210
You know him?

213
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:25,420
We both fiddle around in the Ghost Market.

214
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:27,820
Yin Shilang claims to be a dead man

215
00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:29,830
who's been using this incense

216
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:30,860
to prevent his body from decaying.

217
00:10:31,770 --> 00:10:32,130
By the way,

218
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:35,010
it's said that he became immortal a few days ago.

219
00:10:35,930 --> 00:10:37,510
Who knows what he's up to this time.

220
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:43,150
You're well-informed.

221
00:10:44,430 --> 00:10:46,430
I've lived in the Ghost Market for 40 years.

222
00:10:46,810 --> 00:10:47,870
Of course I am.

223
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:50,380
The Ghost Market is actually a good place

224
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:51,700
except that the sun never rises.

225
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:53,600
No plants grow there.

226
00:10:54,650 --> 00:10:55,340
That's why

227
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,160
Yin Shilang

228
00:10:58,270 --> 00:10:59,410
turned to Kang Yuanli for help.

229
00:11:00,810 --> 00:11:02,250
This is Chang'an.

230
00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:03,860
The city is guarded by six armies.

231
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,570
It's almost impossible

232
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:08,330
to transport prohibited stuff in.

233
00:11:13,290 --> 00:11:15,050
The raw material of the Soul Returning Incense

234
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:17,670
is actually produced in Chang'an.

235
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,630
Could that be the case with the Western Magic Grass too?

236
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:21,860
The Western Magic Grass?

237
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:22,790
General,

238
00:11:22,970 --> 00:11:24,560
my guess is

239
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:26,130
that Chang'an black tea is mainly made of

240
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,380
the Western Magic Grass.

241
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,670
No wonder

242
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:33,260
one has to buy it with gold or silver.

243
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:34,790
That thing

244
00:11:34,810 --> 00:11:35,930
ruined many people's lives.

245
00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:37,160
The Western Magic Grass

246
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,530
has been listed

247
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:39,290
a prohibited herb since Sui dynasty.

248
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,610
It's impossible

249
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:42,920
to import it into Chang'an.

250
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:44,250
So I suspect

251
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:46,170
it's produced here in Chang'an.

252
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:47,660
But there's nowhere here where that herb

253
00:11:47,690 --> 00:11:48,940
can be planted without being noticed.

254
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:50,320
The Imperial Guards

255
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:51,290
will in no way let that happen.

256
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:56,720
There are two large and unoccupied

257
00:11:57,270 --> 00:11:59,420
yards in Chang'an County alone.

258
00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:01,920
I'm afraid there are more and larger available spaces

259
00:12:01,950 --> 00:12:04,000
across Zhuque Avenue in Wannian County.

260
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:06,530
They were sealed up

261
00:12:06,570 --> 00:12:07,520
after the Rebellion of Queen Wei.

262
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,330
Have you

263
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,430
led the Imperial Guards

264
00:12:11,450 --> 00:12:12,810
to check those places, General?

265
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:14,730
Who dares

266
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:16,570
to plant poisonous herbs there?

267
00:12:19,010 --> 00:12:19,760
General.

268
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:20,760
The Great General is here.

269
00:12:30,330 --> 00:12:31,980
Meet you with respect, Great General.

270
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:33,220
Are you hurt?

271
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:35,850
No.

272
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:42,510
-Great General. -Great General.

273
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:43,830
In a just matter of days,

274
00:12:44,590 --> 00:12:46,020
three soldiers were lost.

275
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:47,980
You were injured too.

276
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:50,100
It didn't happen on the battlefield

277
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,950
but in this Ghost Market?

278
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,020
Lu Lingfeng,

279
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,680
you're a huge disgrace

280
00:12:55,710 --> 00:12:56,510
to the Imperial Guards.

281
00:12:57,550 --> 00:12:59,230
You forgot every word I said to you that day,

282
00:12:59,830 --> 00:13:01,570
didn't you?

283
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:03,700
Great General.

284
00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:04,410
Shut up!

285
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:06,870
From now on,

286
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:08,630
you have no right to command the soldiers.

287
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:09,960
Reflect on your mistakes in confinement.

288
00:13:10,370 --> 00:13:11,160
Wait for your punishment.

289
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:18,380
When you emerged from the tunnel last night,

290
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:20,280
did you see what the so-called

291
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:21,340
Immortal Venerable

292
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:22,820
was wearing

293
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:23,930
on his face?

294
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:26,300
The mask of Fang Xiang God.

295
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:27,580
You said

296
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:29,720
the brides started disappearing a year ago.

297
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,190
And Chang'an black tea

298
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:32,420
was put on the market

299
00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:33,510
a year ago as well.

300
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:35,720
I read the records carefully again.

301
00:13:36,630 --> 00:13:37,680
All the brides disappeared

302
00:13:38,010 --> 00:13:39,490
at the beginning or the end of every month,

303
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,330
while every new batch of the tea

304
00:13:41,770 --> 00:13:42,700
was released

305
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:43,820
during the third and the fifth day of each month.

306
00:13:44,330 --> 00:13:45,170
It suggests

307
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:47,670
that these two cases must be related.

308
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,360
What you said

309
00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:54,190
is exactly the same

310
00:13:54,490 --> 00:13:56,000
as what Su Wuming just said.

311
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:00,080
I was just guessing.

312
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:01,990
What the General said is a conclusion.

313
00:14:02,130 --> 00:14:02,850
How are they the same?

314
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:04,020
Besides, how can you compare me

315
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:05,160
with the General?

316
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:05,950
You...

317
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:09,180
You can figure that out sooner than me.

318
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:10,940
You're the disciple of Detective Di after all.

319
00:14:12,330 --> 00:14:13,030
Our priority now

320
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:14,670
is to find the Western Magic Grass

321
00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:16,210
to prove Su Wuming's guess.

322
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:17,620
Well...

323
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,740
He just said that too.

324
00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:26,330
I can't make it myself.

325
00:14:26,730 --> 00:14:28,090
I'm just a sheriff.

326
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,070
I have no right to search those places.

327
00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:33,070
Leave it to me.

328
00:14:33,410 --> 00:14:34,010
General,

329
00:14:34,590 --> 00:14:35,200
the Great General

330
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:36,640
has forbidden you to command the troops.

331
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:38,760
Even if he hadn't,

332
00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:40,700
it wouldn't be easy to access those places.

333
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,100
Bringing guards would only alert the enemy.

334
00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:45,440
But you're not allowed to go out.

335
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,080
The Great General confined you to the house

336
00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:47,860
to reflect on your mistakes.

337
00:14:48,370 --> 00:14:49,410
The Great General has just left.

338
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:51,860
It would be too conspicuous

339
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:52,950
if I left through the front door.

340
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:56,370
However,

341
00:14:57,830 --> 00:14:59,210
no one will know if I sneak out through the window.

342
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:01,530
Wait.

343
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:03,720
You need to wait

344
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:06,390
until it gets dark.

345
00:15:06,950 --> 00:15:08,670
I'll be on the lookout.

346
00:15:09,930 --> 00:15:11,300
Are you advising me to break the curfew?

347
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,110
As the General of the Imperial Guards,

348
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:14,450
how can I uphold the law and break it?

349
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:15,380
Besides,

350
00:15:15,710 --> 00:15:17,480
approaching those places in the broad daylight

351
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,260
is less suspicious.

352
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:20,610
Guo Zhuang,

353
00:15:21,470 --> 00:15:22,790
bring Wen Chao here,

354
00:15:22,810 --> 00:15:24,020
the man we arrested in the Ghost Market last night.

355
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:24,800
Keep it quiet.

356
00:15:24,830 --> 00:15:25,750
Don't let the Great General know.

357
00:15:25,830 --> 00:15:26,660
Yes. -Wen Chao?

358
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:29,780
The minister of the household?

359
00:15:30,050 --> 00:15:30,890
He went to buy

360
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:32,220
Chang'an black tea in person.

361
00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:33,650
He must be hopelessly addicted.

362
00:15:34,210 --> 00:15:35,390
I couldn't elicit anything from him.

363
00:15:35,890 --> 00:15:38,690
But he is in charge of civil affairs like marriage and funeral.

364
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:40,180
He must know something.

365
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:40,670
I'm going right now.

366
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:46,800
You're so meticulous, General.

367
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:51,700
I haven't eaten any chicken today.

368
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,910
Can you bring one back?

369
00:16:30,770 --> 00:16:31,900
There are three suspicious yards.

370
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:33,540
I brought herbs back from each of them.

371
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:41,260
Where are those books I gave you for entertainment?

372
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:42,010
Wait a minute.

373
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,170
[Encyclopedia]

374
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:54,330
[Western Magic Grass]

375
00:16:52,190 --> 00:16:52,950
Look.

376
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,630
It's indeed this toxic grass.

377
00:16:57,670 --> 00:16:58,740
Where are you going?

378
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:00,460
Report this to His Highness.

379
00:17:01,710 --> 00:17:03,510
We haven't arrested the wrongdoer.

380
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:05,619
What's the point of reporting it to His Highness?

381
00:17:06,210 --> 00:17:07,430
The Great General has banned me from commanding the troops.

382
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:08,950
How am I going to arrest the wrongdoer?

383
00:17:10,550 --> 00:17:12,560
Rumors have spread widely

384
00:17:12,579 --> 00:17:14,440
that the Imperial Guards confiscated the black tea

385
00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:17,089
on the directive of His Highness.

386
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,240
There're voices against it already.

387
00:17:19,530 --> 00:17:20,540
Do you mean

388
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:22,800
to make things harder for His Highness?

389
00:17:23,349 --> 00:17:24,000
Do I have

390
00:17:24,030 --> 00:17:24,810
a better option?

391
00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:27,230
You have me,

392
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:28,410
the sheriff of Chang'an County.

393
00:17:28,550 --> 00:17:29,620
Your county guards

394
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:31,250
are all just useless punks.

395
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:35,310
In the Ghost Market last night,

396
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:37,670
under your leadership,

397
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:39,920
those 19 guards

398
00:17:39,970 --> 00:17:42,070
manifested great courage and strength.

399
00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:42,850
But our enemies

400
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:45,940
are not easy to deal with.

401
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:47,510
I have no soldiers.

402
00:17:48,310 --> 00:17:49,110
I can't defeat them.

403
00:17:49,390 --> 00:17:51,700
You can if you fight them the right way.

404
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:54,770
Someone as able as you

405
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:57,260
won't have much trouble

406
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:58,120
taking down that old swindler.

407
00:17:58,180 --> 00:17:59,940
As for his underlings,

408
00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:01,410
they're not your worries.

409
00:18:15,610 --> 00:18:16,200
General Lu.

410
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:18,360
Sheriff Su.

411
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:20,680
Where am I?

412
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:21,350
General.

413
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:22,300
General!

414
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:23,120
Ge…

415
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:25,630
Who is this?

416
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:27,200
A dead man.

417
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:28,520
Don't bother.

418
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:29,370
Mr. Fed,

419
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:31,000
what's the rush?

420
00:18:33,210 --> 00:18:33,880
Come with me.

421
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:38,010
You, come here!

422
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:40,410
I went back to the Ghost Market

423
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:42,350
and got news for you.

424
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:46,590
On the 18th of this month,

425
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:48,740
there will a batch of first-class

426
00:18:48,770 --> 00:18:51,340
Chang'an black tea released in the Ghost Market.

427
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,240
It's unreasonably expensive.

428
00:18:53,930 --> 00:18:55,310
The pre-order has started.

429
00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:56,690
They don't take silver.

430
00:18:57,350 --> 00:18:58,330
One ingot of gold

431
00:18:58,800 --> 00:18:59,650
for one liang of tea.

432
00:19:00,910 --> 00:19:02,060
One ingot of gold

433
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:03,730
for one liang of tea?

434
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:09,130
Wen Chao went to the Ghost Market to buy the tea?

435
00:19:11,110 --> 00:19:11,690
Yes.

436
00:19:12,790 --> 00:19:13,920
He also confessed

437
00:19:14,590 --> 00:19:17,200
that you gave him the money

438
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:19,390
to buy the tea.

439
00:19:22,130 --> 00:19:22,720
I can explain.

440
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:24,680
A few days ago, he came here

441
00:19:24,950 --> 00:19:26,060
and asked for a cup of that tea.

442
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:27,670
I didn't have much tea left myself,

443
00:19:28,190 --> 00:19:29,240
so I gave him money to buy some.

444
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:33,000
I never expected him to go to the Ghost Market.

445
00:19:35,710 --> 00:19:37,590
Sheriff Su,

446
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:40,060
last time you said there was

447
00:19:40,090 --> 00:19:41,220
prohibited ingredient in that tea.

448
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:44,730
That's just your guess.

449
00:19:44,910 --> 00:19:46,410
It was just a guess.

450
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:48,920
I have evidence now.

451
00:19:51,010 --> 00:19:51,870
Please take a look.

452
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:55,900
What's inside?

453
00:19:56,050 --> 00:19:58,260
The raw ingredient of Chang'an black tea.

454
00:19:58,930 --> 00:20:00,230
The Hades Grass,

455
00:20:00,370 --> 00:20:03,620
also known as the Western Magic Grass.

456
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:08,470
It's really a prohibited herb?

457
00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:17,250
What else did Wen Chao say?

458
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:24,850
He said the Chang'an black tea

459
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,360
you've been drinking

460
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:28,880
was from him.

461
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:33,070
That's true.

462
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:35,440
It's just a gift from a student to his teacher.

463
00:20:36,150 --> 00:20:37,760
That's not a bribe, right?

464
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:39,000
Of course not.

465
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:42,710
But do you know

466
00:20:42,730 --> 00:20:44,210
how Wen Chao got the tea?

467
00:20:45,890 --> 00:20:47,360
I suppose he bought it.

468
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:49,620
You must have heard of

469
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:52,490
how expensive Chang'an black tea is.

470
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:53,750
How much

471
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:55,660
is the monthly salary of the minister of the household?

472
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:58,180
I bet you know it very well.

473
00:21:01,810 --> 00:21:03,030
Can he afford it?

474
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:07,100
He came to me twice a month.

475
00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:08,660
The exchange occurred in my house.

476
00:21:12,850 --> 00:21:15,300
Wen Chao is the official in charge of civil affairs.

477
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:17,380
He exchanged the name lists of the newlyweds

478
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:18,910
for Chang'an black tea.

479
00:21:20,090 --> 00:21:21,440
I wonder if His Highness...

480
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:23,620
Sheriff Su.

481
00:21:23,890 --> 00:21:25,270
That has nothing to do with me.

482
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:27,350
If I'd known

483
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:28,350
how he got the tea,

484
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:30,210
I wouldn't have accepted it.

485
00:21:30,890 --> 00:21:31,870
I'm afraid

486
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:36,710
His Highness

487
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:38,220
won't think so.

488
00:21:39,910 --> 00:21:40,720
Su Wuming,

489
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:42,380
don't try to threaten me

490
00:21:42,410 --> 00:21:43,400
with His Highness.

491
00:21:44,390 --> 00:21:45,710
What do you want?

492
00:21:45,850 --> 00:21:46,540
Just name it.

493
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:48,940
I want to see my father.

494
00:21:49,450 --> 00:21:50,580
Who dares to stop me!

495
00:21:55,810 --> 00:21:56,520
My Lord,

496
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:57,570
I...

497
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:01,170
Xijun.

498
00:22:01,890 --> 00:22:02,500
What's the matter?

499
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:03,440
Father,

500
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:04,920
you told me

501
00:22:05,450 --> 00:22:06,540
that Chang'an black tea

502
00:22:06,650 --> 00:22:07,740
could relieve my pain.

503
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:09,230
I want to drink it now.

504
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:13,740
No problem.

505
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:17,990
Sheriff Su,

506
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:20,470
my daughter hasn't eaten or drunk for days.

507
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:21,800
She only wants death.

508
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:23,860
Now she's finally willing

509
00:22:24,130 --> 00:22:25,400
to have some tea.

510
00:22:25,770 --> 00:22:27,520
I have to make it for her

511
00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:29,600
no matter what the tea is make of.

512
00:22:32,310 --> 00:22:32,980
Wait a moment.

513
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:34,860
Come on.

514
00:22:36,050 --> 00:22:36,760
Xijun.

515
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:38,160
Have a seat.

516
00:22:38,850 --> 00:22:40,840
I'll make you some tea.

517
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:47,000
Xijun.

518
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:48,730
What are you doing?

519
00:22:49,130 --> 00:22:49,720
Father,

520
00:22:50,930 --> 00:22:52,610
you've sent guards to watch me day and night.

521
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,660
I got no chance to end my life.

522
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:56,320
I have no choice.

523
00:22:57,020 --> 00:22:57,920
I've made up my mind.

524
00:22:58,580 --> 00:22:59,730
Please prepare a horse for me.

525
00:23:00,010 --> 00:23:01,190
I'll go to the Western Region

526
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:02,260
to seek for Xiao.

527
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:03,570
I'll hit the road right now.

528
00:23:08,670 --> 00:23:10,220
You don't have to travel that far

529
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:12,380
to see General Xiao.

530
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:15,070
Who are you?

531
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:17,790
Sheriff of Chang'an, Su Wuming.

532
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:18,910
Greetings to you, Miss.

533
00:23:19,490 --> 00:23:20,350
It's none of your business.

534
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:24,470
Then I'll take my leave.

535
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:28,640
What a pity.

536
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:30,970
There is no scope

537
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:32,970
for my revival skill.

538
00:23:33,190 --> 00:23:33,750
Stop!

539
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:37,850
Revival skill?

540
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:43,460
Where you miss the dead

541
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:46,580
is where the soul of the dead is.

542
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:48,750
Miss Xijun

543
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:51,040
misses General Xiao day and night,

544
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:52,860
and even wants to die with him.

545
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:53,810
How could his soul

546
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:55,670
stay in the Western Region?

547
00:23:56,970 --> 00:23:57,660
Su Wuming.

548
00:23:58,020 --> 00:23:58,880
You don't know the whole story

549
00:23:58,910 --> 00:24:00,160
of my daughter's thing.

550
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:01,580
Stop interrupting.

551
00:24:02,110 --> 00:24:05,290
If you believe me, Miss Xijun,

552
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:09,360
please wait patiently.

553
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,620
At midnight tonight,

554
00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:13,420
I will use my revival skill

555
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:15,840
to summon General Xiao

556
00:24:16,150 --> 00:24:17,770
to meet you. How is that?

557
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:22,340
Why should I trust you?

558
00:24:22,970 --> 00:24:25,840
Trust me or not. It all depends on you, Miss.

559
00:24:26,670 --> 00:24:29,980
It's just that even if you want to kill yourself,

560
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:33,300
waiting for another four hours isn't hard, right?

561
00:24:35,730 --> 00:24:38,800
You look pale.

562
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:41,870
I think you should eat something right now,

563
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:43,560
and then dress up.

564
00:24:43,630 --> 00:24:44,220
Otherwise,

565
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:46,430
when you see General Xiao later...

566
00:24:49,090 --> 00:24:52,490
Four hours will pass in a blink.

567
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:00,410
Okay.

568
00:25:01,050 --> 00:25:01,540
Okay.

569
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:12,620
Su Wuming.

570
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:15,260
What revival skill?

571
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:17,630
If you can't slove the problem,

572
00:25:17,710 --> 00:25:18,870
Xijun will die

573
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:20,220
and I will kill you.

574
00:25:26,570 --> 00:25:27,210
Assistant Minister Pei,

575
00:25:27,890 --> 00:25:28,850
you asked me just now

576
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:30,630
what exactly I wanted to do.

577
00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:32,930
I didn't have time to tell you the truth.

578
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:33,880
I didn't expect

579
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:37,050
Miss Xijun to come here at that time.

580
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,350
You wanted to do something

581
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:41,430
to my daughter?

582
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:43,650
I want to cure Miss Xijun.

583
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,060
I want to relieve her from anxiety.

584
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:46,780
Can you?

585
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,680
I already have a ready-made prescription.

586
00:25:49,150 --> 00:25:51,230
Don't play tricks on me.

587
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:54,510
General Xiao is the anxiety to my daughter.

588
00:25:55,650 --> 00:25:57,260
Now General Xiao is dead.

589
00:25:57,590 --> 00:25:59,040
There is no prescription to cure her.

590
00:26:02,650 --> 00:26:03,590
Assistant Minister Pei,

591
00:26:04,450 --> 00:26:06,150
just wait and see

592
00:26:06,270 --> 00:26:07,700
my revival skill.

593
00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:11,900
I need to borrow something from you.

594
00:26:11,930 --> 00:26:13,020
The picture.

595
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:15,320
General Xiao's portrait

596
00:26:16,570 --> 00:26:18,410
drawn by Miss Xijun.

597
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:32,260
Who drew this?

598
00:26:33,950 --> 00:26:35,870
The daughter of Pei Jian, Assistant Minister of the Ministry of Personnel Administration,

599
00:26:35,910 --> 00:26:36,720
Pei Xijun.

600
00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:38,030
Su Wuming.

601
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:39,150
The war is around the corner,

602
00:26:39,790 --> 00:26:41,080
why are you talking about Assistant Minister Pei's daughter again?

603
00:26:41,410 --> 00:26:42,440
Don't you have anything else to do?

604
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:43,940
In the past,

605
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:46,540
the new tea was launched

606
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:47,890
on the third day

607
00:26:47,910 --> 00:26:49,750
after the bride went missing.

608
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:50,870
But this time,

609
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:53,270
the so-called first-class Chang'an black tea

610
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:55,540
will be launched on the 18th day of the seventh lunar month.

611
00:26:55,890 --> 00:26:58,300
Three days before that is the Hungry Ghost Festival.

612
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:01,680
If they made the brides go missing

613
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:03,170
to make tea,

614
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:04,670
are they taking advantage of

615
00:27:04,690 --> 00:27:05,770
the nether marriage?

616
00:27:06,990 --> 00:27:08,260
But what is the connection

617
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:09,600
between these things?

618
00:27:11,450 --> 00:27:12,610
The key to solve the case

619
00:27:13,030 --> 00:27:14,470
is to act cautiously.

620
00:27:14,590 --> 00:27:15,910
Some doubts

621
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:20,890
can't be solved at once.

622
00:27:22,010 --> 00:27:22,960
So just now,

623
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:24,460
I asked you to let Wen Chao go.

624
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:26,370
He has signed

625
00:27:26,390 --> 00:27:27,620
on his statement.

626
00:27:27,870 --> 00:27:29,290
If he doesn't want to die,

627
00:27:29,620 --> 00:27:32,690
he will atone for his crimes by doing good deeds.

628
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,790
You are here, Immortal.

629
00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:02,310
Minister Wen, how are you these day?

630
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:03,490
Good. Good.

631
00:28:03,650 --> 00:28:05,010
No, no. Not good.

632
00:28:06,330 --> 00:28:08,720
Why didn't you come last month, Immortal?

633
00:28:09,350 --> 00:28:10,830
I've prepared

634
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:12,020
the list of the brides.

635
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:15,580
You are blaming me for not delivering tea, right?

636
00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:16,940
Yes.

637
00:28:17,430 --> 00:28:18,950
Without the immortal tea,

638
00:28:19,090 --> 00:28:21,600
my mind has been somewhat unhinged lately.

639
00:28:25,510 --> 00:28:26,230
Take it.

640
00:28:31,250 --> 00:28:31,740
By the way,

641
00:28:32,290 --> 00:28:34,020
I heard a rumor before

642
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:36,660
that you had ascended

643
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:37,910
and left the mortal world.

644
00:28:38,530 --> 00:28:40,210
Fortunately, it's just a rumor.

645
00:28:40,330 --> 00:28:41,300
It's not a rumor.

646
00:28:41,950 --> 00:28:44,460
I did ascend.

647
00:28:45,930 --> 00:28:47,560
So, you are...

648
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,370
If you drink immortal tea often,

649
00:28:49,790 --> 00:28:53,610
it will be easy

650
00:28:54,370 --> 00:28:56,020
to ascend and become an immortal or come back to the mortal world.

651
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:00,590
Immortal,

652
00:29:00,970 --> 00:29:02,100
what can I do for you?

653
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:04,410
Three days later is the Hungry Ghost Festival.

654
00:29:04,570 --> 00:29:06,450
How many marriages are there?

655
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:08,790
You must be joking.

656
00:29:08,910 --> 00:29:10,130
What kind of people would marry a daughter on that day?

657
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:10,960
Nether marriage.

658
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:13,480
It has been a century since Chang'an had such custom.

659
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:17,400
Is Minister Wen trying to hide it?

660
00:29:17,950 --> 00:29:18,960
No. No. No.

661
00:29:19,510 --> 00:29:22,080
It's just that they come to report the nether marriage

662
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:23,960
the day before the Hungry Ghost Festival.

663
00:29:24,890 --> 00:29:25,610
Okay.

664
00:29:26,690 --> 00:29:28,360
Prepare the list

665
00:29:29,030 --> 00:29:30,300
at midnight of the 14th day of the seventh lunar month

666
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:31,900
and wait for me.

667
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:34,700
Yes.

668
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:44,360
Only you can save yourself

669
00:29:45,190 --> 00:29:46,750
if you don't want to go to the Imperial Prison.

670
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:48,410
How?

671
00:29:48,770 --> 00:29:51,380
The Immortal Venerable who met you before

672
00:29:51,710 --> 00:29:54,270
will come to you again soon.

673
00:29:54,770 --> 00:29:55,970
No, I don't think so.

674
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:58,550
He usually comes at the end of the month or the beginning of the month.

675
00:29:58,870 --> 00:29:59,950
This time,

676
00:30:02,770 --> 00:30:04,290
he will come in the middle of the month.

677
00:30:05,890 --> 00:30:06,680
What does what you said

678
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,730
have anything to do with Miss Pei?

679
00:30:10,530 --> 00:30:11,160
Of course.

680
00:30:11,930 --> 00:30:13,270
Chang'an is so big.

681
00:30:13,410 --> 00:30:15,200
I'm afraid many families

682
00:30:15,610 --> 00:30:16,560
have nether marriage.

683
00:30:17,410 --> 00:30:19,870
Only by letting the opponent

684
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:21,910
lock the target we prepared for him

685
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:23,500
can we secure the victory.

686
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:24,940
And

687
00:30:26,030 --> 00:30:29,270
Miss Xijun wants to meet the person in the painting...

688
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:30,650
You'll kill her.

689
00:30:30,990 --> 00:30:31,640
Su Wuming.

690
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:32,620
I won't allow you

691
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:33,720
to use Xijun as the bait.

692
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:38,920
General

693
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:40,630
calls the name of Miss Pei directly.

694
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:42,750
It seems that you two...

695
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:48,630
Please tell me the truth, General.

696
00:30:55,650 --> 00:30:56,410
A few months ago,

697
00:30:57,250 --> 00:30:58,640
my cousin Xiao Bozhao met His Majesty.

698
00:30:58,780 --> 00:30:59,780
He was appointed General Mingwei

699
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:01,140
and was going to lead the army to the west.

700
00:31:02,370 --> 00:31:04,010
Assistant Minister Pei's daughter warmly hosted a feast

701
00:31:04,270 --> 00:31:04,960
to see him off.

702
00:31:05,890 --> 00:31:08,480
But he was having fun with female singers

703
00:31:08,850 --> 00:31:09,730
and didn't have time for the feast.

704
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:11,770
He asked me to take his place.

705
00:31:13,490 --> 00:31:14,990
I always hated him for being dissipated.

706
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:16,350
So I decisively refused.

707
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:18,420
But he was so shameless.

708
00:31:19,670 --> 00:31:20,970
I decided to tell Miss Pei

709
00:31:21,390 --> 00:31:23,130
about my cousin's scandals when I met her.

710
00:31:23,370 --> 00:31:24,300
I'd never hide his scandals for him.

711
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:26,080
However,

712
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:54,910
although Miss Xijun is not beautiful enough to overthrow cities and ruin states,

713
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:57,030
she is elegant,

714
00:31:57,060 --> 00:31:59,020
and intelligent.

715
00:31:59,610 --> 00:32:01,240
General didn't want her to be sad

716
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:03,400
when you saw her.

717
00:32:05,390 --> 00:32:06,040
Exactly.

718
00:32:06,330 --> 00:32:08,560
You had a great conversation during the feast

719
00:32:08,780 --> 00:32:10,000
and fell in love with each other.

720
00:32:10,510 --> 00:32:10,960
No.

721
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:12,890
I kept the appointment in place of my cousin.

722
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:14,290
So I didn't take it seriously.

723
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:15,820
How could we fall in love?

724
00:32:17,050 --> 00:32:18,350
You didn't take it seriously?

725
00:32:19,010 --> 00:32:20,000
You performed the swordplay

726
00:32:20,750 --> 00:32:21,970
very seriously.

727
00:32:22,770 --> 00:32:23,670
I drank a few more cups.

728
00:32:25,030 --> 00:32:26,590
I performed the swordplay

729
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:27,920
to thank Miss Pei for her kindness.

730
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:31,450
But now, her kindness has become deep love for you.

731
00:32:32,070 --> 00:32:33,960
Since General Xiao passed away,

732
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:34,740
Miss Xijun

733
00:32:34,770 --> 00:32:36,580
has tried to kill herself many times.

734
00:32:37,050 --> 00:32:38,340
If anything happens to her,

735
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:40,320
it's you, Lu Lingfeng,

736
00:32:40,450 --> 00:32:41,720
who cause her death.

737
00:32:43,950 --> 00:32:45,530
It's my fault.

738
00:32:48,070 --> 00:32:49,230
I'll go to the Assistant Minister's residence

739
00:32:49,350 --> 00:32:49,980
to explain the whole story.

740
00:32:50,110 --> 00:32:51,440
You are now

741
00:32:51,490 --> 00:32:53,260
General Xiao who died in battle.

742
00:32:54,250 --> 00:32:55,730
If you show up rashly,

743
00:32:56,220 --> 00:32:58,730
you'll really scare Miss Xijun crazy.

744
00:33:00,050 --> 00:33:00,780
What should I do then?

745
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:05,010
Just make the best of a mistake.

746
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:08,230
How about performing the swordplay again

747
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:09,650
tonight?

748
00:34:49,949 --> 00:34:50,620
Su Wuming.

749
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:52,780
Why do I think

750
00:34:52,810 --> 00:34:53,750
this guy looks so familiar?

751
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:55,469
That's right.

752
00:34:55,870 --> 00:34:56,889
You know him.

753
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:59,360
General of the Imperial Guards, Lu Lingfeng.

754
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:01,500
How could you

755
00:35:01,530 --> 00:35:02,490
use such a clumsy trick？

756
00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:02,860
What if...

757
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:04,530
What if Xijun finds out the truth?

758
00:35:05,150 --> 00:35:07,230
What trick?

759
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:09,020
It isn't

760
00:35:09,050 --> 00:35:10,290
General Xiao in the painting.

761
00:35:10,370 --> 00:35:11,660
It's him, Lu Lingfeng.

762
00:35:12,070 --> 00:35:13,660
He is the one.

763
00:36:05,730 --> 00:36:07,100
Xiao.

764
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:08,500
Wait.

765
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:14,770
This is an illusion.

766
00:36:15,650 --> 00:36:17,560
Don't disturb General Xiao.

767
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:28,510
Su Wuming always comes up with bad ideas.

768
00:36:29,090 --> 00:36:30,070
Why did he ask you to perform the swordplay?

769
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:31,140
Look.

770
00:36:31,590 --> 00:36:32,790
The wound opened up again.

771
00:36:33,210 --> 00:36:34,420
If I had the golden armor to protect the body,

772
00:36:35,350 --> 00:36:36,770
I wouldn't have been shot.

773
00:36:37,690 --> 00:36:38,640
With the silver spear,

774
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:41,100
it can't take me a lot of effort

775
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:42,090
to kill the enemy.

776
00:36:50,630 --> 00:36:51,830
Golden armor and silver spear?

777
00:36:52,060 --> 00:36:53,490
Take them wherever you go.

778
00:36:53,650 --> 00:36:54,440
It's easy to say.

779
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:55,890
Golden armor is easy to carry.

780
00:36:56,930 --> 00:36:57,620
But the spear

781
00:36:58,580 --> 00:36:59,300
is too long.

782
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:03,070
General must be thinking about

783
00:37:03,090 --> 00:37:04,500
the things three days later, right?

784
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:23,760
What are you doing?

785
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:28,370
My spear!

786
00:37:29,450 --> 00:37:30,410
How dare you! Chicken Fed!

787
00:37:30,630 --> 00:37:31,440
Is this what you did?

788
00:37:31,730 --> 00:37:32,100
No.

789
00:37:32,980 --> 00:37:34,090
Didn't you say it was too long

790
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:35,120
to carry.

791
00:37:38,190 --> 00:37:39,320
Listen to me. Listen to me.

792
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:39,900
Listen to me.

793
00:37:42,210 --> 00:37:44,700
I went back to the Ghost Market last night

794
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:46,940
and bought this from the tomb robber.

795
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:48,200
So expensive!

796
00:37:50,910 --> 00:37:52,040
Take a look.

797
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:52,770
Take your time.

798
00:38:08,530 --> 00:38:09,240
Give it to me.

799
00:38:16,450 --> 00:38:18,020
Look how it is now.

800
00:38:25,650 --> 00:38:26,690
Good for you, Chicken Fed.

801
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:28,610
You do more than healing.

802
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:36,810
Since it's expensive,

803
00:38:37,310 --> 00:38:37,910
tell me the price.

804
00:38:38,580 --> 00:38:39,110
I'll pay you.

805
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:45,530
Do you think I have money?

806
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:48,620
Then whose money did you use?

807
00:38:49,780 --> 00:38:51,080
Of course it's yours.

808
00:38:52,590 --> 00:38:54,230
When I changed your dressing yesterday,

809
00:38:54,610 --> 00:38:56,100
I took the jade tablet

810
00:38:56,130 --> 00:38:56,740
on your waist.

811
00:38:56,980 --> 00:38:57,420
You...

812
00:38:57,590 --> 00:38:58,150
Listen to me.

813
00:38:58,660 --> 00:39:00,390
I wanted to exchange it for money,

814
00:39:00,470 --> 00:39:01,870
so that I could eat and drink my fill for months.

815
00:39:02,140 --> 00:39:03,170
I didn't have to come back

816
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:04,070
and take risks with you.

817
00:39:04,290 --> 00:39:05,240
But I didn't expect

818
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:06,870
to meet it.

819
00:39:07,170 --> 00:39:08,980
I thought you would need it recently.

820
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:10,230
So I didn't use that money

821
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:11,710
to buy chicken

822
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:12,540
or booze.

823
00:39:14,630 --> 00:39:17,940
It's a blessing for the jade tablet

824
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:19,530
to be exchanged for this treasure.

825
00:39:40,570 --> 00:39:41,120
How's it going?

826
00:39:41,370 --> 00:39:42,040
The Crown Prince's oral instruction:

827
00:39:42,330 --> 00:39:43,340
I've been busy with official affairs lately.

828
00:39:43,580 --> 00:39:44,300
I have no time to see you.

829
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:48,030
Crown Prince also said

830
00:39:48,630 --> 00:39:49,500
that since the Great General

831
00:39:49,530 --> 00:39:50,570
asked you to ponder over your mistakes in solitude,

832
00:39:51,870 --> 00:39:53,030
you should just obey the military order.

833
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:16,300
Greetings to you, Sheriff Su.

834
00:40:18,670 --> 00:40:20,380
What are you doing?

835
00:40:22,230 --> 00:40:23,510
We searched the Ghost Market under your order the day before yesterday

836
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:24,420
and met strong opponents.

837
00:40:25,060 --> 00:40:26,220
Without the protection of the Imperial Guards,

838
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:28,620
we wouldn't have come back.

839
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:30,110
The two Imperial Guards

840
00:40:30,140 --> 00:40:30,910
covering us behind

841
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:32,780
were shot to death.

842
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:35,250
They were His Majesty's bodyguards.

843
00:40:35,660 --> 00:40:36,640
Each of them is more valuable

844
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:37,940
than all of our humble lives.

845
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:41,630
I apologize

846
00:40:43,580 --> 00:40:45,390
for putting brothers in danger.

847
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:47,680
Sheriff Su, what are you sorry for?

848
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:49,310
In the capital,

849
00:40:49,710 --> 00:40:51,180
those enchanters are so rampant.

850
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:52,850
If we meet them again,

851
00:40:53,390 --> 00:40:54,500
we will definitely raise our swords

852
00:40:54,730 --> 00:40:55,610
and kill them.

853
00:40:56,050 --> 00:40:56,470
That's it.

854
00:40:57,070 --> 00:40:58,190
We are practicing hard

855
00:40:58,220 --> 00:40:58,950
the killing skill.

856
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:00,170
If there is another chance,

857
00:41:00,450 --> 00:41:01,820
we can't disgrace Chang'an County.

858
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:02,930
Three foremen are right.

859
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:04,230
We can't eat official rice for nothing.

860
00:41:04,570 --> 00:41:05,030
Yes.

861
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:06,660
We can't eat official rice for nothing.

862
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:09,350
I admire

863
00:41:09,890 --> 00:41:11,510
your heroic saying.

864
00:41:12,110 --> 00:41:14,020
Those enchanters have shown their slip.

865
00:41:14,250 --> 00:41:16,380
We can catch them all in three days.

866
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:19,060
This is the time for brothers

867
00:41:19,220 --> 00:41:20,970
to make contributions.

868
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:23,420
Under your order, Sheriff Su.

869
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:36,670
Pei Jian, Assistant Minister of the Ministry of Personnel Administration,

870
00:41:36,700 --> 00:41:38,060
said that Chang'an black tea was evil tea

871
00:41:38,230 --> 00:41:39,630
in the court today.

872
00:41:40,330 --> 00:41:41,460
He listed four major crimes,

873
00:41:42,010 --> 00:41:42,950
which shocked the court.

874
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:45,840
Has His Majesty issued an edict?

875
00:41:46,370 --> 00:41:46,800
No.

876
00:41:47,690 --> 00:41:48,510
Then what is the attitude

877
00:41:48,660 --> 00:41:49,450
of His Highness?

878
00:41:50,210 --> 00:41:51,160
I didn't hear of it either.

879
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:54,760
Okay.

880
00:41:55,670 --> 00:41:56,290
I see.

881

[Nether Marriage List]

882
00:42:20,950 --> 00:42:22,610
Tomorrow, there will be twelve girls for nether marriage

883
00:42:22,650 --> 00:42:23,500
in Chang'an tomorrow.

884
00:42:23,590 --> 00:42:25,030
Please have a look, Immortal Venerable.

885
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:33,570
Pei Xijun, daughter of Pei Jian.

886
00:42:34,150 --> 00:42:34,760
Yes.

887
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:36,840
I heard that she looked pretty good.

888
00:42:38,330 --> 00:42:39,500
But at this time,

889
00:42:40,180 --> 00:42:41,700
why did Pei Jian suddenly

890
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:42,740
marry his daughter to a dead man?

891
00:42:43,450 --> 00:42:45,590
It's quite a puzzle to me.

892
00:42:48,580 --> 00:42:50,360
I know a little about it.

893
00:42:51,830 --> 00:42:53,430
Pei Xijun's lover

894
00:42:53,460 --> 00:42:54,460
died in a battle in the Western Region.

895
00:42:55,050 --> 00:42:56,770
She misses him like crazy.

896
00:42:57,480 --> 00:42:59,080
Pei Jian had no choice.

897
00:42:59,590 --> 00:43:01,080
Otherwise, in such a high postion,

898
00:43:01,650 --> 00:43:03,590
marrying his daughter to a dead man

899
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:06,660
would make him a joke.

900
00:43:07,170 --> 00:43:08,670
God helps me, too!

901
00:43:07,740 --> 00:43:09,960
[Pei Xijun]

902

She will be the one!

903
00:43:12,030 --> 00:43:13,070
Today, Pei Jian

904
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:15,000
openly listed four major crimes

905
00:43:15,220 --> 00:43:17,520
of my immortal tea in the court.

906
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:19,110
I'll use his daughter

907
00:43:19,140 --> 00:43:21,040
to make my best immortal tea.
