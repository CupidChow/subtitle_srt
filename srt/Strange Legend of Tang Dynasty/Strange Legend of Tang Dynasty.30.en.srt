[Episode 30]

4
00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:46,479
Such a Crown Prince

5
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:48,370
should be

6
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:49,780
worthy of

7
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:51,340
becoming the new emperor of Tang.

8
00:01:53,979 --> 00:01:56,509
It's a great luck for our Tang

9
00:01:56,870 --> 00:01:59,750
to have such a generous Crown Prince.

10
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:04,280
Although I'm incompetent,

11
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:08,509
I will try my best to solve this case,

12
00:02:08,539 --> 00:02:09,490
catch the murderer

13
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:10,660
and get the antidote

14
00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:12,700
to save Her Highness.

15
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:16,370
Lu Lingfeng,

16
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:19,250
as the Crown Prince's most trusted person,

17
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:22,160
you should do your best too.

18
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:23,920
It is not only for

19
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:25,230
the Crown Prince's trust.

20
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:26,579
More importantly,

21
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:30,030
it is to clear the Crown Prince's name.

22
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:35,110
Yes.

23
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:38,230
If Her Highness is dead,

24
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:40,690
the biggest beneficiary

25
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:43,290
will be the Crown Prince.

26
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:45,280
If that's the case,

27
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,520
think about

28
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:49,579
what will the world think of His Highness?

29

30
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:03,050
Thank you for reminding me.

31
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:05,850
To clear the Crown Prince's name,

32
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:08,520
I will do anything to help you

solve this case.

34
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:19,829
Brother, look.

35
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:27,070
I seem to have seen him before.

36
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:30,300
Why does he look so familiar?

37
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:31,980
Lady Hu Shisi also said

38
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,550
that this person stammers slightly,

39
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:34,890
but it's not very obvious.

40
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:40,660
Stammer?

41
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:01,700
Fed, what are you doing?

42
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:02,660
The burning smoke is everywhere,

43
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:03,890
and I can even smell

44
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:05,260
the medicine in my study room.

45
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:06,740
Do you remember the Face Flower

46
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:08,620
Xing Ying sent last time?

47
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:10,380
With it,

48
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:12,400
it won't be difficult

49
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:13,630
to develop the antidote ourselves.

50
00:04:14,050 --> 00:04:14,900
But...

51
00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:16,680
But what?

52
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:22,900
This poison is very strange.

53
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:24,870
After thinking about it,

54
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:27,260
I'm afraid I can only counter it with another poison.

55
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:30,340
So in this antidote,

56
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:31,640
the most important thing will be

57
00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:34,070
Baohuang.

58
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:35,790
If you can

59
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:36,659
get me some Baohuang,

60
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:38,420
maybe the antidote will work

61
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,800
after a few tries.

62
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:45,030

But why is this place so small?

67
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:08,560
It sounds like

68
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:09,690
you are not from Dongdu.

69

My Hall of Medicine might be small,

70
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:12,960
but it's a place where you can find the most nostrum

71

in Luoyang.

72
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:15,370

What should he take?

79
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:28,260
Chrysanthemum, Chinese Goldthread, Swertia Punicea,

80

Dwarf Lilyturf, Cape Jasmine Fruit, or Indigowoad Leaf.

81

Depends on what you want.

82
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:34,610
These are too ordinary.

83

This is a medicine shop!

87

Li Yue?

111

I didn't know

112
00:06:42,159 --> 00:06:43,210
he is someone from the Resident Regent's Residence.

113
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:44,300
I only thought about

114

where he got the Baohuang,

115
00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:48,560
so I asked my men to follow him.

116
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:51,280
I didn't expect that he's from the Resident Regent's Residence.

117
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:54,470
How much do you have now?

118

only sells once a few days.

121

he only brings one or two pieces of it.

123

When will be the specific date of death of Her Highness?

If it's the eighty-first day,

162
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:57,930
that's tomorrow.

163
00:08:59,300 --> 00:08:59,840
Tomorrow?

164
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:00,720
Yes.

165
00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:02,660
The day Her Highness

166
00:09:02,690 --> 00:09:03,880
used the Face Flower for the first time,

167
00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:05,320
I remember it clearly.

168
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:07,320
After tomorrow night,

169
00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:09,670
Her Highness might be...

170
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:12,100
So,

171
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,480
please crack the case as soon as possible

172
00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:15,090
and get the antidote.

173
00:09:15,370 --> 00:09:16,020

00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:49,850
You must be the hostler

177
00:09:50,010 --> 00:09:50,930
for the nobles, right?

178
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:53,510
Who are you?

179
00:09:54,830 --> 00:09:56,790
I'm a Juren staying

180
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:58,280
in the temple.

181
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:00,100
You have a good eye for noticing that.

182
00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:01,840
Let me tell you.

183
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:04,500
I'm the hostler of the Princess's Palace.

184
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:07,730
Nice to meet you.

00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:28,160

[Old Servant of Resident Regent's Residence]

188
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:29,860
The shopkeeper is waiting for you.

189
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:34,260
I've been waiting for you.

190
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:37,860
Who are you?

191
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:40,000
The shopkeeper of the Hall of Medicine.

192
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:41,100
Nonsense!

193
00:10:42,130 --> 00:10:43,820
Where is Shopkeeper Meng?

194
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:48,190
Anyway, you're just bringing us the Baohuang

195
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:50,140
for us to sell on behalf of you.

196
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:52,220
Does is matter who the shopkeeper is?

197
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:57,440
Government investigation.

198
00:10:57,940 --> 00:10:59,020
Take out everything

Who are you?

201
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:05,060
How dare you stop me?

202
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:07,120
I know you're from the Resident Regent's Residence.

203
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:08,620
So what?

204
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:10,020
Xue Huan,

00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:11,200

206
00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:11,670
Yes, master!

207

Don't touch it.

208
00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:23,000
Wrap it up.

209
00:11:23,690 --> 00:11:25,510
Take it back and give it to Chicken Fed immediately.

210
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:29,380
Turn around.

Tell me.

214
00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:47,970
Where is the Baohuang planted at?

215
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:48,610
This...

216
00:11:49,570 --> 00:11:50,130
I...

217
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:52,930
I know.

218
00:11:53,890 --> 00:11:55,610
I know the Baohuang is forbidden goods.

219
00:11:56,650 --> 00:11:57,410
I will accept the punishment.

220
00:11:57,540 --> 00:11:59,180
I won't punish you.

221
00:11:59,710 --> 00:12:01,600
I'll even reward you

222
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:03,020
if you tell me where it is planted at.

223
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:07,490
I...

224
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:10,360
I don't know.

225
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:11,620
You don't know?

226
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:21,160
I'll have to trouble you, Mr. Lu.

227
00:12:25,070 --> 00:12:25,580
Let's go.

228
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:26,810
Where are you taking me?

229
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:28,570
The Resident Regent's Residence, of course.

230
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:30,540
You will take out some

231
00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:32,540
Baohuang to sell

232
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:33,220
once in a while.

233
00:12:33,570 --> 00:12:34,570
I guess it

234
00:12:35,490 --> 00:12:37,700
must be planted in the Resident Regent's Residence.

235
00:12:41,770 --> 00:12:43,500
I did steal the Baohuang,

236
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:46,340
but I just want to make some extra money.

237
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:47,610

238
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:49,660
I've been a servant all my life.

239
00:12:49,890 --> 00:12:50,950
Please don't send me

240
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:52,150
back to the Resident Regent's Residence.

241
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:53,330
I beg you!

242
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:01,910
Why?

243
00:13:02,450 --> 00:13:03,780
He doesn't dare to take us

244
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:05,300
to the place where the Baohuang is planted at.

245
00:13:06,090 --> 00:13:06,710
By doing so,

246
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,430
he might die even worse.

247
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:16,410
Run!

248
00:13:55,950 --> 00:13:56,860
Who are they?

249
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:00,100
Why aren't you running,

250
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:00,860
and got here instead?

251
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:01,710
Run?

252
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:03,450
Where should I run to?

253
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,760
I couldn't run fast since I was young.

254
00:14:06,170 --> 00:14:06,850
Besides,

255
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,040
even if I can run fast,

256
00:14:08,070 --> 00:14:08,830
who knows if they are any killers

257
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:09,640
behind us?

258
00:14:10,090 --> 00:14:11,330
This is a great hiding spot.

259
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:12,900
And I've figured out that

260
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,120
this funeral team

261
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:16,660
is heading towards the east gate.

262
00:14:16,830 --> 00:14:17,550
So what?

263
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:19,510
Isn't Resident Regent Li

264
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:21,220
living outside the upper east gate?

265
00:14:21,530 --> 00:14:22,970
Enough. You've been fighting for a long time.

266
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,520

Something is wrong.

271
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:54,100
They saw us jumping into the cart,

272
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,440
but no one stopped us.

273
00:14:56,310 --> 00:14:57,860
This funeral team

274
00:14:57,930 --> 00:14:59,130
is strange.

275
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:07,580
It's been so hot

276
00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:08,650
this whole trip.

277
00:15:10,370 --> 00:15:10,930
Hurry.

278
00:15:11,290 --> 00:15:11,850
Open it.

279
00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:12,950
Come on. Grab your weapons.

280

Come on.

282
00:15:18,510 --> 00:15:18,950
Take it.

283
00:15:18,970 --> 00:15:19,490
Brother,

284
00:15:20,050 --> 00:15:20,830
it was so risky.

285
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:21,970
I thought

286
00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:23,660
we were exposed.

287
00:15:24,530 --> 00:15:26,770
I've nearly lost control of myself just now.

288
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:28,390
Later, I saw that

289
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:30,080
those people were also covering their faces.

290
00:15:30,570 --> 00:15:31,320
I thought about it,

291
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:32,740
they are not righteous people too.

292
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,390
One should care his own business,

293
00:15:34,690 --> 00:15:35,280
that's good.

294
00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:36,970
Big brother,

295
00:15:37,290 --> 00:15:37,800
second brother.

296
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,500
Two people have jumped into our car.

Get your weapons.

298

Guys,

299
00:16:00,770 --> 00:16:02,290
what do you mean?

300
00:16:04,990 --> 00:16:05,520
Brother,

301
00:16:06,290 --> 00:16:07,520
I guess these two

302
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:09,220
are the wanted ones by those men in black.

303
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:13,020
Thank you

304
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:14,100
for the ride.

305

Well,

and shall leave now.

308

Give me a hand.

-Stop! -Stop!

310
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:25,850
Did you still want to leave?

311
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:27,540
Didn't you see that

312
00:16:28,850 --> 00:16:30,170
the coffin is empty?

313
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,230
If you run away,

314
00:16:32,570 --> 00:16:33,780
it will be a waste.

315
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:38,700
You can't have us lying

316
00:16:38,730 --> 00:16:40,130
in the same coffin.

317
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:41,140
Su Wuming.

318
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:42,380
At a time like this,

319
00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:43,310
you still have the mood

320
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:44,440
to fool these bandits?

321
00:16:47,770 --> 00:16:49,090
They are outnumbered,

322
00:16:49,410 --> 00:16:50,850
there's no need for direct confrontation.

323
00:16:51,190 --> 00:16:52,820
Besides,

324
00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:53,750
I still have important things to do,

325
00:16:53,890 --> 00:16:55,210
and nothing can afford to go wrong.

326
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:56,720
What are you mumbling about?

327
00:16:57,460 --> 00:16:58,220
Cut the crap.

328
00:16:58,610 --> 00:16:59,800
Let's kill them with our knives together,

329
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:00,820
and throw them in the coffin for burial!

330
00:17:00,910 --> 00:17:01,140
Yes.

331
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:01,850
Wait!

332
00:17:06,630 --> 00:17:09,230
How much money can you bandits

333
00:17:09,619 --> 00:17:11,980
make by robbery?

334
00:17:12,290 --> 00:17:13,460
Do you want to follow me

335
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:15,040
and make a fortune?

336
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:21,119
Make a fortune?

337
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:25,020
What do you mean?

338
00:17:25,349 --> 00:17:25,880
Do you know what is

339
00:17:26,849 --> 00:17:29,100
the most expensive thing

340
00:17:29,290 --> 00:17:30,950
in Luoyang City now?

341
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:35,890
Face Flower.

342
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:38,940
Almost all of the girls

343
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:40,220
from rich family

344
00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:42,120
are using the Face Flower.

345
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:44,090
But they don't know that

346
00:17:44,450 --> 00:17:46,740
the Face Flower is deadly poisonous.

347
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:47,930
Without the antidote,

348
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:49,020
they will soon

349
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:51,000
turn into skeletons.

350
00:17:51,430 --> 00:17:52,890
What does it have to do with us?

351
00:17:55,090 --> 00:17:55,710
I...

352
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:58,340
I have the recipe of the antidote.

353
00:17:58,560 --> 00:17:59,600
I only need

354
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:00,790
one last medicine for the antidote.

355
00:18:01,070 --> 00:18:02,120
Think about it.

356
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:03,900
When we bring the antidote

357
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:05,690
back to Luoyang City,

358
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:07,540
we can simply earn

359
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:09,050
mountains of gold and silver.

360
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,530
Are you trying to fool us?

361
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:14,140
He's just fooling you.

362
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:14,680
You...

363
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:15,580
Shut up!

364
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:18,490
My attendant

365
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:20,860
is petty.

366
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:23,290
He's afraid that you'll share the money with him.

367
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:25,570
I've heard of the Face Flower,

368
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:29,740
but do you really have the recipe?

369
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,580
If I don't,

370
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:34,040
why did those killers

371
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:35,130
chase us?

372
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:39,570
You just said that

373
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,100
you're finding the last medicine.

374
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:42,300
How?

375
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:45,100
I know where to find it.

376
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:48,120
I'm just short of hands now,

377
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:50,660
but I don't need so many people.

378
00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:51,380
How about this?

379
00:18:52,210 --> 00:18:53,900
Pick four good fighters

380
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:55,090
and come with me.

381
00:19:03,170 --> 00:19:04,370
You two, come with us.

382
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:05,870
The rest of you shall bring back the goods.

383
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:06,620
-Okay. -Let's go.

384
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:07,230
Hurry up.

385
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:07,810
-Yes. -Hurry!

386
00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:08,620
-Hurry! -Hurry.

387
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:09,220
Come on!

388
00:19:09,450 --> 00:19:11,370
I thought there would be a battle,

389
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:12,610
but you managed to resolve it

390
00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:14,340
by your eloquence.

391
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:16,060
How was it possible?

392
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:21,240
[Resident Regent's Residence]

393
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:29,900
It's here.

394
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:33,620
Isn't this the back door of the Resident Regent's Residence?

395
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:35,210
How did you know?

396
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:36,340
We've been here before.

397
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:38,190
Have you been to the yard?

398
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:38,860
Yes.

399
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:40,310
Aren't they all saying that Li Yue is rich?

400
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:41,280
There were just

401
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:42,240
flowers and plants in the yard.

402
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:44,330
You've got it wrong.

403
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:46,460
Those flowers and plants

404
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:47,080
are the most valuable.

405
00:19:47,130 --> 00:19:47,720
Remember that,

406
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:48,450
the thing we're looking

407
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:49,660
for today

408
00:19:49,930 --> 00:19:51,310
is Baohuang.

409
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:53,770
I don't know what its leaves look like.

410
00:19:54,010 --> 00:19:56,170
Its root is like the palm of a baby，

411
00:19:56,230 --> 00:19:57,340
with leopard print on it.

412
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:00,830
Are you sure it can be found

413
00:20:00,850 --> 00:20:01,700
in the the Resident Regent's Residence?

414
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:02,420
Brother,

415
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:03,790
I think

416
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:05,420
we were fooled by them.

417
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,260
To be honest,

418
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:11,660
Her Highness sent me

419
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:12,870
to find this.

420
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:14,770
Her...

421
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:16,460
Highness?

422
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:19,560
You listen to me tonight.

423
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:20,500
After this,

424
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:21,590
Her Highness will definitely

425
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:23,040
reward you greatly.

426
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:24,700
Remember,

427
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:26,220
It's called Baohuang.

428
00:20:26,710 --> 00:20:27,790
It's very valuable.

429
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,450
Which one is the thing you mentioned?

430
00:20:48,270 --> 00:20:49,240
If I knew,

431
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:50,580
I wouldn't need your help.

432
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:51,900
Let's go over there.

433
00:20:52,610 --> 00:20:53,610
Let's split up and search.

434
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:58,520
I didn't understand when

435
00:20:58,680 --> 00:20:59,910
you said you needed manpower just now,

436
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:01,680
but now I know.

437
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:02,900
Su Wuming,

438
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:04,220
you're so bad.

439
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:05,810
Hurry up.

440
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:07,610
Win or lose, it all ends here.

441
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:10,260
In order to save Her Highness,

442
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:11,610
you're willing to be a thief.

443
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:13,170
Administrator Su,

444
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:15,340
I really admire you.

445
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:17,290
According to Wei Fenghua,

446
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:19,410
the end of Her Highness's life will be tonight.

447
00:21:20,190 --> 00:21:21,550
But what I am thinking about now

448
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:23,340
isn't Her Highness,

449
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:24,480
but those women from Luoyang

450
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:27,240
who were affected by the Face Flower.

451
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:28,740
That's not right.

452
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:31,140
According to your personality, you would say

453
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:33,900
even if Her Highness is domineering,

454
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:36,470
she's still a living person.

455
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:38,420
Cut the crap. There's no time left for us.

456
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:54,300
Go now.

457
00:21:54,910 --> 00:21:55,730
Don't you want to be rich?

458
00:21:56,770 --> 00:21:58,260
It's late at night,

459
00:21:58,460 --> 00:21:59,930
but luckily the moon is bright today.

460
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:01,180
Otherwise,

461
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:02,670
we can't see anything.

462
00:22:25,730 --> 00:22:26,960
Meteorite Bear.

463
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:30,450
Don't go over there.

464
00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:35,940
Lie down and play dead!

465
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:36,780
Hurry.

466
00:23:36,810 --> 00:23:38,050
Administrator Su,

467
00:23:38,890 --> 00:23:40,570
how's your day been so far?

468
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:54,380
Resident Regent Li,

469
00:23:55,660 --> 00:23:56,770
aren't you going to

470
00:23:57,260 --> 00:23:58,940
untie us?

471
00:23:59,610 --> 00:24:03,290
Isn't it too early to untie you now?

472
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:05,040
The assassins we sent today

473
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:05,980
failed,

474
00:24:06,210 --> 00:24:08,410
but you came to me yourself instead.

475
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:11,750
It must be fate.

476
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:12,540
Li Yue,

477
00:24:12,810 --> 00:24:14,130
as an imperial official,

478
00:24:14,430 --> 00:24:15,450
you are involving in

479
00:24:15,490 --> 00:24:16,620
these sordid businesses secretly.

480
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:18,220
Do you know what will be your punishment?

481
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:20,020
Aren't you just

482
00:24:20,050 --> 00:24:21,570
a personal staff?

483
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:24,340
You have no right to speak here.

484
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:24,800
You!

485
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:28,200
Su Wuming. Su Wuming.

486
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,640
You're indeed Di Renjie's disciple.

487
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:34,020
After my greedy servant died,

488
00:24:34,050 --> 00:24:34,670
I knew

489
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:36,380
you would find my manor.

490
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:38,540
But I didn't expect that you would come so soon.

491
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:39,340
Luckily,

492
00:24:39,540 --> 00:24:41,290
I had brought the Meteorite Bear from the Sky Garden

493
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:43,770
to this place.

494
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:44,840
How was it?

495
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:47,110
That is a strange beast

496
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:48,990
that is rare in the world

497
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:49,900
and no ordinary person get to see it.

498
00:24:50,170 --> 00:24:52,320
You've opened your eyes today, right?

499
00:24:53,730 --> 00:24:56,330
But I would rather see

500
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:58,740
your Human-faced flower tree

501
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:00,050
and Baohuang.

502
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:02,850
Since you're here,

503
00:25:03,770 --> 00:25:05,050
not letting you see them

504
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:07,690
is not the way to treat guests.

505
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:26,030
The things you're looking for

506
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:27,170
are all here.

507
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:32,590
I didn't expect that

508
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:35,100
you would actually plant these evil things

509
00:25:35,130 --> 00:25:37,510
in your secret room.

510
00:25:38,650 --> 00:25:40,690
It is also a coincidence.

511
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:42,170
My manor

512
00:25:42,170 --> 00:25:44,150
was originally a villa of Yang Su,

513
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:46,260
Duke of Yue, from the previous Sui Dynasty.

514
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:48,940
Empress Wu Zetian rewarded me with it when she was in politics.

515
00:25:49,210 --> 00:25:50,020
Accidentally,

516
00:25:50,150 --> 00:25:51,800
I found this secret room.

517
00:25:52,490 --> 00:25:55,420
It was stacked

518
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:56,520
with rusty weapons back then.

519
00:25:56,870 --> 00:25:58,660
It's obvious that Yang Su

520
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:00,430
wanted to rebel.

521
00:26:00,990 --> 00:26:02,680
This is his armory.

522
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:04,500
But I think

523
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:06,580
to achieve great things,

524
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:08,950
no sword nor spear is as good as a plant.

525
00:26:09,510 --> 00:26:10,150
It so happens that

526
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:12,790
the Baohuang can only grow

527
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:14,100
in the dark,

528
00:26:14,290 --> 00:26:15,550
just like me.

529
00:26:16,270 --> 00:26:17,660
My homeland is broken.

530
00:26:18,810 --> 00:26:20,210
I am thousands of miles away from my home

531
00:26:21,010 --> 00:26:22,700
and was living under someone else's roof.

532
00:26:25,450 --> 00:26:27,110
As for the Human-faced flower tree,

533
00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:28,380
I bought it

534
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:30,500
from the wandering royal descendants of Persia.

535
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:33,160
Now, dozens of them have been reproduced.

536
00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:35,800
After many years of cultivation,

537
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:38,020
they are already used to

538
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:39,690
grow in the dark.

539
00:26:40,070 --> 00:26:42,340
As long as you plant the Baohuang around them,

540
00:26:42,470 --> 00:26:43,430
they will have

541
00:26:43,650 --> 00:26:45,600
enough nutrients.

542
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:48,620
After decades,

543
00:26:49,130 --> 00:26:50,150
they can no longer survive

544
00:26:50,590 --> 00:26:53,230
without each other.

545
00:26:53,730 --> 00:26:55,010
You also killed

546
00:26:55,690 --> 00:26:56,710
that Tocharian woman?

547
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:01,410
She is just a slave

548
00:27:01,530 --> 00:27:02,470
I found at the South Market

549
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:04,140
who knows

550
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:05,130
some escaping methods.

551
00:27:05,570 --> 00:27:06,940
She is nothing.

552
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:08,140
Li Yue,

553
00:27:09,190 --> 00:27:12,030
you've benefited from the Tang for years,

554
00:27:12,060 --> 00:27:13,260
especially the Empress Wu Zetian.

555
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:15,030
She has treated you well.

556
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:16,920
But you actually cooked up

557
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:18,470
the poisonous Face Flower

558
00:27:18,990 --> 00:27:20,190
to kill people.

559
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:22,500
Where's your conscience?

560
00:27:22,910 --> 00:27:23,920
Su Wuming.

561
00:27:24,570 --> 00:27:25,480
Why are you using those superfacial words

562
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:28,050
in front of me?

563
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:32,790
You can find this place

564
00:27:32,810 --> 00:27:33,520
in such a short time,

565
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:35,300
which is indeed

566
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:36,760
beyond my expectations.

567
00:27:37,590 --> 00:27:39,450
I'm a man who loves talents.

568
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:40,890
I'll let you live

569
00:27:40,890 --> 00:27:42,480
for a few more hours.

570
00:27:42,710 --> 00:27:44,060
Didn't you come here

571
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:45,670
for the Face Flower and Baohuang?

572
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:47,620
You can go in and have a look.

573
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:51,140
Move!

574
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:52,980
In the room!

575
00:28:40,270 --> 00:28:41,540
Stop your useless efforts!

576
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:43,580
If we could get out easily,

577
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:45,580
Li Yue wouldn't have locked us

578
00:28:45,610 --> 00:28:46,440
in here.

579
00:28:47,030 --> 00:28:48,100
Just now, Li Yue said

580
00:28:48,750 --> 00:28:50,480
this was Yang Su's arsenal.

581
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:51,380
Yes.

582
00:28:51,850 --> 00:28:52,700
In that case,

583
00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:54,700
there must be an exit.

584
00:28:55,660 --> 00:28:57,840
How can you be so sure?

585
00:28:58,130 --> 00:28:59,060
If one wants to rebel,

586
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:00,790
the soldiers will need to rush out all at once.

587
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:03,020
All soldiers leaving through that secret door together.

588
00:29:03,890 --> 00:29:04,490
Is that possible?

589
00:29:08,030 --> 00:29:10,040
That makes sense.

590
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:12,160
Keep searching then.

591
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:23,910
He has planted so many evil things to poison the princess.

592
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:28,670
He's really scheming.

593
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:33,190
Li Yue and the Crown Prince

594
00:29:33,210 --> 00:29:34,340
are very close.

595
00:29:34,610 --> 00:29:35,360
Don't talk nonsense.

596
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:37,600
His Highness is righteous.

597
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:38,860
He wouldn't have

598
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,030
such evil people around him.

599
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:46,210
Then there must be something else behind

600
00:29:47,090 --> 00:29:49,230
the so-called crime of poisoning the princess.

601
00:29:49,390 --> 00:29:50,020
Su Wuming.

602
00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:51,740
You didn't find some clues

603
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:53,780
and hide them from me, right?

604
00:30:00,110 --> 00:30:02,200
[Resident Regent's Residence]

605
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:19,580
Your Highness.

606
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:20,700
Please.

607
00:30:24,890 --> 00:30:26,060
Bring them all here.

608
00:30:32,590 --> 00:30:33,100
Bring them in.

609
00:30:33,230 --> 00:30:33,660
Yes!

610
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:05,860
Don't move.

611
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:12,410
Look, what is that?

612
00:31:13,890 --> 00:31:14,660
It looks like

613
00:31:15,510 --> 00:31:16,670
a map.

614
00:31:17,260 --> 00:31:18,060
A map?

615
00:31:28,490 --> 00:31:29,890
You just assumed that

616
00:31:30,610 --> 00:31:32,690
there's another exit in the secret room.

617
00:31:32,710 --> 00:31:33,590
If there is,

618
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:36,320
the exit should be hidden in this map.

619
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:37,830
The three old books

620
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:38,860
you lent me

621
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:41,910
contain the landscape and buildings

622
00:31:41,930 --> 00:31:43,020
of the city of Luoyang.

623
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:44,580
I just read it

624
00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:45,180
a few days ago.

625
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:46,060
That's great.

626
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:47,670
Take a good look.

627
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:48,860
It depends on you

628
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:49,640
whether we are going out.

629
00:31:57,110 --> 00:31:59,910
Yang Su wanted to rebel.

630
00:32:00,830 --> 00:32:02,880
It's natural that he wants to become the emperor.

631
00:32:07,540 --> 00:32:08,820
For him,

632
00:32:14,490 --> 00:32:16,370
this place is the most important place.

633
00:32:14,810 --> 00:32:17,030
[Longmen Mountain]

634
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:26,480
It's not moving.

635
00:32:27,490 --> 00:32:29,790
The westernmost mountain of Luoyang is called Longmen Mountain.

636
00:32:29,970 --> 00:32:31,400
The easternmost is the Fragrant Hill.

637
00:32:32,930 --> 00:32:33,360
This...

638
00:32:37,570 --> 00:32:39,770
Greetings, Your Majesty.

639
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:43,600
Isn't it still too early to call me that?

640
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:44,770
No at all.

641
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:47,940
Although the current emperor is benevolent and kind,

642
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:49,680
he lacks of courage

643
00:32:49,930 --> 00:32:51,410
and can't control the imperial court.

644
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:53,940
You have the same style as the Heavenly Empress.

645
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:56,030
Only you can

646
00:32:56,060 --> 00:32:58,220
rebuild the glory of the Tang.

647
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:02,690
You're indeed from the other region.

648
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:04,980
You're so straightforward.

649
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:08,670
However, you still have to address me as "Your Highness" for now.

650
00:33:08,890 --> 00:33:09,380
Yes,

651
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:10,740
Your Highness.

652
00:33:11,230 --> 00:33:13,590
Su Wuming is in my hand.

653
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:14,950
What happened?

654
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:17,110
He's here to steal the Baohuang,

655
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:18,210
and was caught by me.

656
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:19,500
Baohuang?

657
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:21,010
The herb is used to make the antidote

658
00:33:21,030 --> 00:33:22,970
to cure the poison of the Face Flower.

659
00:33:25,870 --> 00:33:26,840
I knew it.

660
00:33:27,060 --> 00:33:28,120
Su Wuming

661
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:29,900
is loyal to me.

662
00:33:30,780 --> 00:33:33,110
In order to solve the case and get the antidote,

663
00:33:33,250 --> 00:33:34,530
he spares no effort.

664
00:33:34,930 --> 00:33:35,870
He even took the risk

665
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:36,960
of coming here this time.

666
00:33:38,190 --> 00:33:39,430
I didn't test him in vain.

667
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:40,960
I can use him.

668
00:33:41,730 --> 00:33:43,340
I can use him!

669
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:47,880
He has another attendant

670
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:48,860
called Lu Lingfeng.

671
00:33:48,970 --> 00:33:49,970
He's here too.

672
00:33:51,290 --> 00:33:52,460
Lu Lingfeng.

673
00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:55,890
He seems to work for the Crown Prince.

674
00:33:57,910 --> 00:33:59,690
I know Lu Lingfeng.

675
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:03,030
He is indeed close to the Crown Prince.

676
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:05,990
Then I know

677
00:34:06,010 --> 00:34:07,120
what to do now.

678
00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:08,020
I have

679
00:34:08,050 --> 00:34:09,340
many beasts here,

680
00:34:09,409 --> 00:34:11,120
including the Meteorite Bear,

681
00:34:11,139 --> 00:34:12,179
which can fight back a lion and kill an elephant.

682
00:34:12,199 --> 00:34:13,639
I can see that Lu Lingfeng

683
00:34:13,670 --> 00:34:14,980
seems to know some martial arts.

684
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:17,840
How about letting him to have a fight

685
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:18,880
with my bear?

686
00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:20,860
We can enjoy the fight together.

687
00:34:21,650 --> 00:34:23,050
I'm not in the mood.

688
00:34:24,380 --> 00:34:26,050
I'll think about

689
00:34:26,929 --> 00:34:27,830
what should we do with Lu Lingfeng.

690
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:31,770
But Gao Zhongyi and others I've brought here

691
00:34:31,909 --> 00:34:33,210
are

692
00:34:33,420 --> 00:34:34,889
all disloyal to me.

693
00:34:35,570 --> 00:34:38,290
They are perfect to feed your bear.

694
00:34:40,070 --> 00:34:41,870
Yes, I'll do it right away.

695
00:34:42,940 --> 00:34:43,510
Wait.

696
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:45,830
They thought

697
00:34:45,929 --> 00:34:47,560
my face

698
00:34:47,730 --> 00:34:49,340
would turn into a skull tonight.

699
00:34:49,850 --> 00:34:51,050
That's why they betrayed me.

700
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:54,780
How about letting them have a taste

701
00:34:55,780 --> 00:34:58,590
of their faces being corroded.

702
00:34:59,650 --> 00:35:00,910
That's easy.

703
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:03,310
Just make a special kind of Face Flower.

704
00:35:03,470 --> 00:35:04,160
Once it was applied,

705
00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:05,970
the effect should be seen immediately.

706
00:35:06,370 --> 00:35:07,020
Please wait for a moment.

707
00:35:07,250 --> 00:35:08,920
I'll send someone to make the poison.

708
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:19,750
This one is big.

709
00:35:26,070 --> 00:35:26,880
Lu Lingfeng.

710
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:27,710
You have been standing there

711
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:29,140
for almost an hour.

712
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:31,460
Is there any mechanism on this map?

713
00:35:31,490 --> 00:35:32,930
Can we get out?

714
00:35:33,590 --> 00:35:34,790
What I'm doing now

715
00:35:34,950 --> 00:35:36,120
is more meaningful than you.

716
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:37,220
What's the use of getting the Baohuang

717
00:35:37,470 --> 00:35:38,710
if we can't get out?

718
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:40,010
It will only make Li Yue

719
00:35:40,690 --> 00:35:42,340
want to kill us more desperately.

720
00:35:48,010 --> 00:35:50,540
The Yishui River flows through the two mountains,

721
00:35:50,810 --> 00:35:52,000
which look like a gate,

722
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:53,570
so that place is called Yi Gate.

723
00:35:54,210 --> 00:35:55,480
After Emperor Yang ascended the throne,

724
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:57,050
he changed the capital to Luoyang.

725
00:35:57,910 --> 00:35:58,760
The gate of the royal palace

726
00:35:59,660 --> 00:36:01,110
was facing here,

727
00:36:02,190 --> 00:36:03,560
so it was also known as the Long Gate.

728
00:36:05,550 --> 00:36:07,090
If Yang Su wants to rebel,

729
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:09,290
he must first break through the Long Gate of the Sui.

730
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:28,360
Lu Lingfeng.

731
00:36:28,950 --> 00:36:29,620
Good for you.

732
00:36:29,790 --> 00:36:31,060
Thanks to your three old books.

733
00:36:37,340 --> 00:36:38,070
What are you waiting for?

734
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:41,280
I can't leave.

735
00:36:42,370 --> 00:36:42,960
Your Highness.

736
00:36:43,220 --> 00:36:43,810
Please.

737
00:36:48,870 --> 00:36:50,400
Invite Su Wuming over

738
00:36:50,430 --> 00:36:51,670
to have a drink together.

739
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:54,070
Yes.

740
00:36:58,340 --> 00:37:00,160
How was your flower viewing?

741
00:37:03,070 --> 00:37:03,640
Not bad.

742
00:37:08,540 --> 00:37:09,420
Where's Lu Lingfeng?

743
00:37:10,110 --> 00:37:10,670
Who?

744
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:14,080
Lu Lingfeng, he...

745
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:16,180
He was here just now.

746
00:37:17,030 --> 00:37:18,010
I don't know

747
00:37:18,030 --> 00:37:18,990
where he is now.

748
00:37:26,710 --> 00:37:27,770
My lord, no one is here.

749
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:34,630
You!

750
00:37:35,170 --> 00:37:37,300
You have let Lu Lingfeng go!

751
00:37:37,820 --> 00:37:38,500
Resident Regent,

752
00:37:39,270 --> 00:37:40,630
this is your secret room.

753
00:37:40,670 --> 00:37:41,380
He's a living person.

754
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:42,120
How can I

755
00:37:42,150 --> 00:37:43,120
let him go?

756
00:37:43,550 --> 00:37:45,030
As far as I know,

757
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:46,340
Lu Lingfeng

758
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:48,300
know the Earth escaping method.

759
00:37:48,330 --> 00:37:49,600
He might have gone into the ground

760
00:37:49,630 --> 00:37:50,670
and gone somewhere.

761
00:38:03,550 --> 00:38:05,040
I asked you to invite Su Wuming

762
00:38:05,070 --> 00:38:06,020
to have a drink with us.

763
00:38:06,140 --> 00:38:07,710
Why did you send him here under escort?

764
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:08,770
Your Highness,

765
00:38:09,270 --> 00:38:11,430
he let Lu Lingfeng go.

766
00:38:12,630 --> 00:38:14,230
Although Lu Lingfeng has ran away,

767
00:38:14,590 --> 00:38:16,090
he stayed.

768
00:38:16,820 --> 00:38:17,800
What does this mean?

769
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:20,480
All the more reason for his loyalty to me.

770
00:38:21,390 --> 00:38:22,160
Su Wuming.

771
00:38:23,390 --> 00:38:23,750
Here.

772
00:38:24,550 --> 00:38:26,320
I'll propose a toast to you myself.

773
00:38:29,670 --> 00:38:30,570
Administrator Su,

774
00:38:30,870 --> 00:38:32,540
I've offended you just now.

775
00:38:39,990 --> 00:38:40,670
Your Highness,

776
00:38:41,660 --> 00:38:43,220
let the drinks aside.

777
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:44,800
At this moment,

778
00:38:45,270 --> 00:38:47,280
I'm more worried about your safety.

779
00:38:48,030 --> 00:38:50,020
What happened tonight

780
00:38:50,230 --> 00:38:51,280
had nothing to do with you.

781
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:53,070
But I didn't expect

782
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:54,330
that you came here.

783
00:38:55,060 --> 00:38:56,290
Let me ask you.

784
00:38:56,530 --> 00:38:58,250
How is your investigation going?

785
00:38:59,350 --> 00:39:00,500
Four hours later,

786
00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:01,580
after midnight,

787
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:04,710
my face will turn into a skull.

788
00:39:05,270 --> 00:39:07,320
What I'm worried about is your safety,

789
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:11,150
not about your face

790
00:39:11,580 --> 00:39:12,880
turning into a skull.

791
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:15,250
You know everything?

792
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:18,380
Even if you used the Face Flower,

793
00:39:19,420 --> 00:39:20,830
you would still be fine.

794
00:39:24,410 --> 00:39:25,240
Tell me.

795
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:26,570
Why?

796
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:32,470
The horses eat a lot.

797
00:39:34,060 --> 00:39:35,220
For a long journey,

798
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:36,980
you have to feed them more in the first two days.

799
00:39:38,070 --> 00:39:39,070
Long journey?

800
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:40,210
Where are you going?

801
00:39:41,180 --> 00:39:41,870
Back to Chang'an.

802
00:39:43,830 --> 00:39:44,510
To be honest,

803
00:39:44,790 --> 00:39:46,620
Her Highness wants to eat cherries in Chang'an.

804
00:39:46,860 --> 00:39:47,790
It's only been a couple of days.

805
00:39:49,130 --> 00:39:50,620
Everyone in Chang'an knows

806
00:39:51,070 --> 00:39:52,270
Her Highness likes to eat

807
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:54,300
the King's cherry from the Leyou Plain.

808
00:39:54,430 --> 00:39:56,210
So I think

809
00:39:56,310 --> 00:39:57,310
the hostler's words are true.

810
00:39:57,940 --> 00:39:59,580
These talkative people

811
00:40:00,140 --> 00:40:01,200
should be killed.

812
00:40:02,430 --> 00:40:03,910
Since he said

813
00:40:04,270 --> 00:40:06,290
Her Highness' schedule was set,

814
00:40:06,820 --> 00:40:08,610
I has ruled out

815
00:40:08,670 --> 00:40:12,040
the fact that Her Highness had used the poisonous Face Flower.

816
00:40:12,110 --> 00:40:14,510
Because if you were really in danger,

817
00:40:14,750 --> 00:40:15,420
Your Highness,

818
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:18,590
I don't think you would have the mood to go back.

819
00:40:22,430 --> 00:40:23,490
You're right.

820
00:40:24,310 --> 00:40:26,500
I did use the Face Flower,

821
00:40:27,070 --> 00:40:28,880
but that flower wasn't

822
00:40:28,910 --> 00:40:29,700
soaked in poison.

823
00:40:30,670 --> 00:40:33,100
It's different from what the commoners have used.

824
00:40:34,510 --> 00:40:35,190
Li Yue,

825
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:36,360
the Face Flower

826
00:40:36,390 --> 00:40:37,750
you specially made for me alone

827
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:40,940
indeed has the skin tendering and moisturizing effect.

828
00:40:42,870 --> 00:40:45,390
I like various flowers in my life.

829
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:46,880
Ten years ago,

830
00:40:47,310 --> 00:40:48,440
when I went to the South Market,

831
00:40:48,740 --> 00:40:50,060
I bought the seed of the tree

832
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:51,510
from a down and out

833
00:40:51,540 --> 00:40:52,820
royal descendent of Persia.

834
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:55,040
That's why I can grow this strange flower

835
00:40:55,550 --> 00:40:58,290
in the east captital, Luoyang.

836
00:41:00,370 --> 00:41:01,310
So,

837
00:41:02,140 --> 00:41:03,640
Gao Zhongyi and the others

838
00:41:04,310 --> 00:41:06,030
are so stupid.

839
00:41:06,590 --> 00:41:08,070
They thought I was dying,

840
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:09,720
so they saw the wind and set the helm

841
00:41:09,950 --> 00:41:12,000
and betrayed me to join the Crown Prince.

842
00:41:13,050 --> 00:41:14,730
How foolish!

843
00:41:14,860 --> 00:41:16,070
How despicable!

844
00:41:19,660 --> 00:41:20,260
Your Highness,

845
00:41:20,630 --> 00:41:21,870
my plan

846
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:23,180
works, right?

847
00:41:23,810 --> 00:41:24,570
Yes.

848
00:41:25,420 --> 00:41:26,650
Very effective.

849
00:41:27,530 --> 00:41:28,440
Xin Huaishen.

850
00:41:28,610 --> 00:41:29,030
Yes.

851
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:30,280
After all,

852
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:32,170
you were once Gao Zhongyi's man.

853
00:41:32,590 --> 00:41:34,370
He seems to have something to say.

854
00:41:34,820 --> 00:41:36,630
Go and help him.

855
00:41:43,850 --> 00:41:44,410
Your Highness.

856
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:45,910
Spare my life, Your Highness.

857
00:41:46,660 --> 00:41:47,340
Administrator Su,

858
00:41:47,570 --> 00:41:49,330
please say something nice for me.

859
00:41:52,870 --> 00:41:53,760
Gao Zhongyi.

860
00:41:54,550 --> 00:41:56,650
How dare you call for help?

861
00:41:57,070 --> 00:41:58,150
Your Highness,

862
00:41:58,510 --> 00:42:00,030
I just had one wrong thought.

863
00:42:00,310 --> 00:42:01,850
Just a wrong thought.

864
00:42:01,870 --> 00:42:02,640
Prefectural Governor Gao,

865
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:05,490
you didn't just have a momentary slip.

866
00:42:05,990 --> 00:42:07,430
You were acting

867
00:42:07,470 --> 00:42:08,600
very resolutely

868
00:42:08,990 --> 00:42:10,480
in front of me.

869
00:42:10,750 --> 00:42:12,260
Are you worthy of

870
00:42:12,410 --> 00:42:15,300
Her Highness's trust all these years?

871
00:42:29,850 --> 00:42:33,950
♫The storm rises with no reason♫

872
00:42:34,660 --> 00:42:37,030
♫In the night of illusions♫

873
00:42:38,820 --> 00:42:40,410
♫I go into the maze♫

874
00:42:42,630 --> 00:42:47,300
♫In a world of prosperity♫

875
00:42:48,450 --> 00:42:50,480
♫A heart burns with obsession♫

876
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:53,450
♫With the darkness rising♫

877
00:42:54,810 --> 00:43:00,460
♫I can't stop wandering through the night♫

878
00:43:01,310 --> 00:43:07,490
♫With light in my heart, I'm not afraid of the storm♫

879
00:43:07,820 --> 00:43:11,540
♫It's because of justice♫

880
00:43:14,290 --> 00:43:20,150
♫That I seek a truth for this long, lonely night♫

881
00:43:20,900 --> 00:43:26,790
♫The heaven and earth are held together by a strong will♫

882
00:43:27,770 --> 00:43:29,550
♫The people are in peace♫

883
00:43:29,780 --> 00:43:33,940
♫Carving right and wrong into a clear heart♫

884
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:35,650
♫The truth♫

885
00:43:36,210 --> 00:43:39,280
♫Will reinterpret this justice♫

886
00:43:41,140 --> 00:43:45,430
♫Even if there is fog♫

887
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:48,430
♫Even if there are invisible waves♫

888
00:43:50,020 --> 00:43:52,020
♫I'll tell the story of the fate♫

889
00:43:54,120 --> 00:43:58,550
♫Tell the love of the world♫

890
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:02,040
♫For the memory of grace♫

891
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:05,330
♫And the resentment is not yet over♫

892
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:11,720
♫The rivers and mountains are immortal, the clouds are overturned♫

893
00:44:12,690 --> 00:44:18,880
♫To be consoled by the truth, even with thorns on my back♫

894
00:44:19,210 --> 00:44:23,610
♫It's because of justice♫

895
00:44:25,590 --> 00:44:31,870
♫That I seek a truth for this long, lonely night♫

896
00:44:32,110 --> 00:44:38,000
♫The heaven and earth are held together by a strong will♫

897
00:44:39,110 --> 00:44:41,170
♫The people are in peace♫

898
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:45,630
♫Carving right and wrong into a clear heart♫

899
00:44:46,310 --> 00:44:47,690
♫The truth♫

900
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:51,450
♫Will reinterpret this justice♫

901
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:57,790
♫Even if there are a thousand sails, it's not a waste of time♫

902
00:44:58,150 --> 00:45:04,330
♫What I am afraid of is the unrighted wrong♫

903
00:45:04,950 --> 00:45:06,860
♫What is the meaning of life and death?♫

904
00:45:07,150 --> 00:45:11,280
♫I'll paint the sunshine into the landscape♫

905
00:45:11,550 --> 00:45:13,250
♫The spirit of righteousness♫

906
00:45:13,410 --> 00:45:17,390
♫Exists for the one I care♫
