4
00:01:47,570 --> 00:01:49,160
It's not the custom of Ju County

5
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:51,789
to build tombs in buildings, right?

6
00:01:54,539 --> 00:01:56,320
I followed my uncle's last wish.

7
00:01:57,220 --> 00:01:59,240
He practiced medicine in the Hall of Life all his life.

8
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:01,190
Before he died, he told me

9
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:04,740
he wanted to guard the Hall of Life

10
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:08,110
in the underworld.

11
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,880
He had no children,

12
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:13,670
and left this house to me.

13
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:18,120
What reason did I have not to agree with him?

14
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:21,860
You're filial.

15
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:22,980
But it

16
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:25,260
is against the custom.

17
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:27,230
What would the neighbors think if they knew?

18
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:28,630
Yes.

19
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:32,880
So, Sheriff,

20
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:35,860
I hope you won't tell anyone about this.

21
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:37,790
As for your rent,

22
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:38,910
and the money to the shop owners,

23
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:40,140
I'll return them to you.

Sheriff Lu, don't go.

33
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:17,790
What's the matter, Magistrate?

34
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:20,410
I heard that Sheriff Lu had caught

35
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:21,640
the murderer of the rape and murder case.

36
00:03:21,829 --> 00:03:22,840
You earned the praises of the people

37
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:24,120
and cheered the people greatly.

38
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:25,770
Congratulations.

00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:27,380
It's my duty.

40

Don't say that.

41
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:32,700
This is a big deal for Ju County.

42

Yes.

Magistrate means that

44

Yes.

Although the murderer is dead,

51
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:48,060
the head of the deceased hasn't been found yet.

52
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:49,360
So the case is not closed.

53
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:51,160
Why need I parade through the streets?

54
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:55,820

Amitabha.

105

I am the abbot.

106

107
00:08:21,590 --> 00:08:22,490
as what happened 40 years ago.

108
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:24,550
You were here then.

Yes.

110
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:27,510
At that time,

111
00:08:28,210 --> 00:08:30,110
I just became a monk in this temple.

112
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,640

the body bag

121
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:48,000

Yes.

125
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:53,860
When did you change it today?

00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:56,400
At five o'clock in the morning.

127
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:58,260
There was no bag on the incense table at that time.

who prepare for the exam here.

Anyone who visited the temple this morning

137
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:16,060
should be listed one by one.

is there any missing person reported

No.

143
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:22,650
Put up a notice.

144
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:24,170
Find out the identity of the deceased as soon as possible.

145
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:25,020
Yes.

Please spare me.

149
00:09:37,290 --> 00:09:37,810
Spare you?

150
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:39,330
Why do you say so?

151
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:41,250
You have no idea, Sheriff.

152
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:43,450
The body of the dismemberment case 40 years ago

153
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:45,420
was examined by my father.

154
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:46,960
In less than a month,

155
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:48,540
he hung himself.

156
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:50,290
That year,

157
00:09:50,830 --> 00:09:52,060
my father was 42 years old.

158
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:53,740
This year,

159
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:55,470
I'm also 42 years old.

160
00:09:56,370 --> 00:09:57,790
I quit my job as a coroner.

161
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:58,840
I quit.

162
00:09:58,980 --> 00:09:59,980
I quit!

163
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:04,940
Sheriff,

164
00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:08,340
he's the only coroner in Ju County.

165
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:10,670
Only one coroner in the whole Ju County?

166
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:11,630
Yes.

167
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:14,260
It's pretty good

168
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,160
to have one in such a remote county.

169
00:10:16,570 --> 00:10:17,690
Since his father died,

170
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:18,610
this job in Ju County

171
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:20,800
had been vacant for years.

172
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:22,730
Until he grew up

173
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:24,150
and went to the city to learn,

174
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:25,340
then...

175
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:33,450
The key of this case is the autopsy.

176
00:10:34,890 --> 00:10:36,190
Even if I'm not a coroner,

177
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:37,690
I know a little about it.

178
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,020
I can have a try.

179
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,020
[County Government of Ju County]

180
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:47,620
Give me a basket of oranges.

181
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:48,460
Pick the best ones.

182
00:11:49,330 --> 00:11:49,730
Okay.

183
00:11:53,370 --> 00:11:54,000
You really don't need to write a letter?

184
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:54,730
No need.

185
00:11:54,970 --> 00:11:56,200
Just send this basket of oranges

186
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:57,670
to Commander Su of Nanzhou.

187
00:11:57,810 --> 00:11:58,530
Be careful.

188
00:11:58,780 --> 00:11:59,340
Be quick.

189
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:00,020
Don't worry.

190
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:05,660
For Lu Lingfeng,

191
00:12:06,210 --> 00:12:08,520
the hardest thing is to ask for help.

192
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:09,790
Therefore,

193
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:12,240
if you find that he needs help,

194
00:12:12,410 --> 00:12:14,380
send a basket of oranges here.

195
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:22,580
Xijun.

196
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:23,460
Come here.

197
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:24,570
Have a taste.

198
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:25,400
What is it?

199
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:27,170
Oranges.

200
00:12:27,590 --> 00:12:28,980
Xue Huan is so thoughtful

201
00:12:29,090 --> 00:12:30,540
to send a basket of oranges

202
00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:32,130
all the way from Ju County.

203
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:44,310
I'm not sleeping.

204
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:46,870
The dismemberment case has reappeared.

205
00:12:47,430 --> 00:12:49,060
I can't even eat.

206
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:51,710
How can I sleep

207
00:12:51,930 --> 00:12:54,090
when I'm hungry?

208
00:12:54,230 --> 00:12:56,240
Magistrate cares about the people.

209
00:12:57,510 --> 00:12:59,090
I admire you.

210
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:00,670
Stop!

211
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:01,840
Don't flatter me.

212
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,720
I'm worried about myself.

213
00:13:05,890 --> 00:13:07,010
40 years ago,

214
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:08,580
the former county magistrate lost his post

215
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:09,940
because of the dismemberment case.

216
00:13:12,770 --> 00:13:15,020
I'm just unlucky.

217
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:17,820
Isn't Lu Lingfeng in Ju County?

218
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:20,300
He's just a sheriff.

219
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:21,700
Even if the higher-up wants to apportion blame,

220
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:24,600
will he be blamed?

221
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:27,140
He has a background.

222
00:13:29,730 --> 00:13:31,750
If he can guarantee it,

223
00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:33,850
when the higher-up wants to apportion blame,

224
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:37,000
we can let him take responsibility.

225
00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:45,410
Thank God.

226
00:13:45,770 --> 00:13:47,070
His Majesty's grace is immeasurable.

227
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:49,500
It's a great honor

228
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:50,660
to have Sheriff Lu in Ju County.

229
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:51,970
You solved the rape and murder case

230
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:53,360
seven days after taking office.

231
00:13:53,890 --> 00:13:55,100
You have made the first contribution.

232
00:13:55,610 --> 00:13:57,150
Now the dismemberment case

233
00:13:57,180 --> 00:13:58,500
has reappeared after 40 years.

234
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:00,830
That means the murderer

235
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:01,790
is still alive.

236
00:14:02,630 --> 00:14:03,980
Isn't it a good chance for you

237
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:05,800
to make another great contribution in Ju County?

238
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:06,870
-Yes. -I believe

239
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:08,870
you can bring the murderer

240
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:09,730
to justice

241
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:12,470
and give back the clear sky of Ju County!

242
00:14:12,730 --> 00:14:13,660
That's right.

243
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:15,080
I'm here today

244
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:17,110
to tell you that

245
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:18,260
from now on,

246
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:20,120
I'll take care of

247
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:20,840
all the trivial things.

248
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:22,990
Even if I have to collect taxes

249
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:23,940
from door to door.

250
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:25,270
I will also repair the roof.

251
00:14:25,570 --> 00:14:26,940
Although I'm weak,

252
00:14:27,530 --> 00:14:28,240
I can still

253
00:14:28,330 --> 00:14:29,610
climb the ladder.

254
00:14:29,630 --> 00:14:29,990
It...

255
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:32,480
It's not appropriate.

256
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:34,260
It's my duty.

257
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:35,610
I wouldn't dare to trouble you.

258
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:36,520
No, no, no

259
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,080
In the face of a serious case,

260
00:14:38,590 --> 00:14:40,510
you should focus on solving it.

261
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:41,200
Yes.

262
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:44,020
You are so reasonable, Magistrate.

263
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:45,500
I'm grateful for your kindness.

264
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:47,020
Please forgive me

265
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:48,090
my previous disrespect before.

266
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:51,440
But, brother,

267
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,110
the people are looking forward to it.

268
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:55,330
We should set a deadline

269
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,390
for this case.

270
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:00,360
Seven days.

271
00:15:00,890 --> 00:15:01,500
Master!

272
00:15:02,850 --> 00:15:03,950
Seven days.

273
00:15:04,530 --> 00:15:05,580
It's too short.

274
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:06,710
That's right.

275
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:07,740
One month is fine.

276
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:10,670
Why do you push yourself so hard?

277
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:12,270
You just need to give people

278
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:13,300
an explanation.

279
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:14,290
Just seven days.

280
00:15:14,970 --> 00:15:15,610
Please arrange

281
00:15:15,630 --> 00:15:16,710
the feast seven days later.

282
00:15:17,190 --> 00:15:17,600
The rules

283
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:18,930
are the same as last time.

284
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,400
Brother Lu is really heroic.

285
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:23,190
I'm impressed.

286
00:15:23,530 --> 00:15:24,120
By the way,

287
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:25,530
Magistrate has asked me

288
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:27,390
to find a coroner in Nanzhou.

289
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:29,500
Even if it costs a lot,

290
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:31,500
I will invite the best coroner

291
00:15:31,570 --> 00:15:32,540
to Ju County.

292
00:15:33,890 --> 00:15:34,540
Sheriff Lu.

293
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:39,380
Sheriff.

294
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:40,410
Outside the county government,

295
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:41,810
a few people came to see you.

296
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:45,140
The leader said he was the coroner you hired.

297
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:47,110
When did I hire a coroner?

298
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:48,670
They should be here.

299
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:53,940
Mr Su.

300
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:54,780
Miss.

301
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:55,430
Fed.

302
00:15:55,730 --> 00:15:56,680
You're all here.

303
00:15:56,970 --> 00:15:57,680
Why are you...

304
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:58,750
Where are the bodies?

305
00:15:58,850 --> 00:15:59,560
How many bags in total?

306
00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:00,960
They're in the icehouse. Four bags in total.

307
00:16:00,990 --> 00:16:01,750
Take me there.

308
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:09,780
Look at the dress.

309
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:11,520
You are the magistrate,

310
00:16:11,710 --> 00:16:12,840
and you are the assistant of county magistrate?

311
00:16:13,690 --> 00:16:15,710
Do you have any good wine in Ju County?

312
00:16:16,490 --> 00:16:17,370
Who are you?

313
00:16:17,730 --> 00:16:18,540
I am

314
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:22,140
Military Commander of Nanzhou,

315
00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:24,360
Su Wuming's guest.

316
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:25,470
You two

317
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:26,460
are so ignorant.

318
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:27,340
Why didn't you

319
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,450
greet Commander Su just now?

320
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:30,980
Commander

321
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:32,600
Su?

322
00:16:33,810 --> 00:16:34,840
Is the one who went in just now

323
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:36,260
the famous Commander Su?

324
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,200
He's the coroner, isn't he?

325
00:16:38,490 --> 00:16:39,330
Coroner?

326
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:44,820
What is the relationship between Commander Su

327
00:16:45,090 --> 00:16:46,540
and Sheriff Lu?

328
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:47,570
They're close.

329
00:16:48,930 --> 00:16:49,490
Well...

330
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,300
You won't understand.

331
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:52,900
There's one more here.

332
00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:54,270
This is

333
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:57,120
the daughter of Assistant Minister Pei of Ministry of Personnel Administration.

334
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,720
Miss. Xijun.

335
00:17:01,590 --> 00:17:02,360
Greetings, Magistrate.

336
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:03,480
Assistant of county magistrate.

337
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:04,890
I dare not.

338
00:17:05,099 --> 00:17:06,770
Go prepare some food and wine.

339
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:08,800
Miss. Xijun had a tough journey.

340
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:09,920
She must be starving.

341
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:11,819
Yes.

342
00:17:12,339 --> 00:17:12,980
Yes.

343
00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:14,109
Please.

344
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:23,710
The bags are well stored.

345
00:17:24,450 --> 00:17:25,800
Leave the autopsy to me.

346
00:17:26,069 --> 00:17:27,510
Go

347
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:28,280
find other clues.

348
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:30,250
Please!

349
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:38,980
All the relevant people of Radiance Temple, Destiny Temple,

350
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:39,760
Greenery Temple,

351
00:17:39,930 --> 00:17:41,490
and Lingdang Temple

352
00:17:41,930 --> 00:17:43,040
have inquired.

353
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:44,510
Someone claimed

354
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:46,480
to have seen the suspect who took the bag.

355
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:47,850
Tell me.

356
00:17:48,770 --> 00:17:49,620
However,

357
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:51,910
people's descriptions are quite different.

358
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:53,760
Some people said it was an old man.

359
00:17:54,070 --> 00:17:55,410
Some people said it was an old woman.

360
00:17:56,050 --> 00:17:56,860
Some people even said

361
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:58,440
it was a beggar.

362
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:03,530
But we have clues

363
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:04,830
to the victim's identity.

364
00:18:06,010 --> 00:18:06,500
Just say it.

365
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:07,720
Recently,

366
00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:08,650
except for a woman

367
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:09,730
named Lady Hui,

368
00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:11,050
no one else went missing.

369
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:12,220
Lady Hui?

370
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:14,440
She lived in the south of the county.

371
00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:15,710
She had a mother.

372
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:18,200
She was the mistress of Qian Xiaoyi,

373
00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:19,850
who is the owner of the Fujia pawnshop.

374
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:22,380
Lady Hui's disappearance

375
00:18:23,010 --> 00:18:24,370
must be her fault.

376
00:18:24,450 --> 00:18:25,060
Who is she?

377
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:26,300
My wife.

378
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:28,080
Half a month ago,

379
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:28,860
she chased Lady Hui with a knife.

380
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:29,950
If I hadn't stopped her,

381
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:31,630
Lady Hui would have been killed.

382
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:33,590
In that case,

383
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:35,220
your wife

384
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:36,500
didn't know you had a concubine before?

385

[Pawnshop owner, Qian Xiaoyi]

386
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:37,980
Yes.

387
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:39,420
Otherwise,

388
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:41,950
she would have already cut Lady Hui into pieces.

389
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:43,260
She will do this.

390
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:44,630
Because she hates her so much?

391
00:18:44,910 --> 00:18:45,410
No.

392
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:48,090
Because she can butcher pigs.

393
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:50,620
Before my wife got married with me,

394
00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:51,820
she followed her father to butcher pigs.

395
00:18:52,010 --> 00:18:53,820
They are the people

396
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:55,340
who kill the most pigs in Ju County.

397

the daughter of Carver Hu?

399
00:18:58,850 --> 00:18:59,490
Exactly.

You know him?

401
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:01,660
Your father-in-law

402
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:02,990
is a famous butcher in the county.

403

Where is your wife now?

405
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:08,670
She's feeding pigs at home.

406
00:19:09,430 --> 00:19:09,980
Bring her to question.

407
00:19:10,970 --> 00:19:11,350
Yes, sir.

408
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:20,940
Who is it?

409
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:22,610
It's me.

Mr.

412

You have been performing the autopsy for four hours.

413

Take a break.

414
00:19:34,510 --> 00:19:35,030
No need.

415
00:19:35,630 --> 00:19:36,630
My Lady asked

416
00:19:37,290 --> 00:19:38,940
if you needed her

417
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:39,660
to help you record.

418
00:19:42,230 --> 00:19:44,360
This body has no bones.

419
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:45,360
It's extremely horrible.

420
00:19:46,330 --> 00:19:47,880
Don't let her come. It'll scare her.

421
00:19:49,370 --> 00:19:51,530
You can tell Lu Lingfeng first

422
00:19:51,650 --> 00:19:52,930
that this is a female body

423

with a red mole on her right chest.

424

Answer me.

There's a red mole on her right chest.

of the dismemberment case？

It's karma.

Why do you carry a knife with you?

So I'm used to carrying a knife.

Where were you the night before yesterday?

I fed the pigs.

Did you feed the pigs all night?

454

After feeding pigs, I went back to my parents' home.

Commander Su's autopsy report

470

matches with Qian Xiaoyi's confession.

471

The victim should be Lady Hui.

472

Before the accident,

00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:30,130
Qian Xiaoyi wanted to break up with Lady Hui.

474

They had a fight because of it.

She kept saying all the time that she wanted to kill her.

Both of them have motives.

479
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:40,280
I think

480
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:41,930
we should

481
00:21:42,410 --> 00:21:43,340
throw them into prison and torture them.

They are suspected.

483

But it's still early to send them to jail,

484
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:48,020
and it's inappropriate to torture them.

485
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:49,140
Keep an eye on them

00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:11,650
What

524
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:13,000
did your daughter cook for you?

525
00:23:15,770 --> 00:23:16,910
The day before yesterday?

526
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:19,450
By the way, Dad,

527
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:21,160
where did you go the night before yesterday?

528
00:23:21,430 --> 00:23:22,140
I made dinner

529
00:23:22,170 --> 00:23:22,940
and waited for you all night.

530
00:23:22,970 --> 00:23:23,880
But you didn't come back.

531
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,480
My hands were itching.

532
00:23:27,550 --> 00:23:28,060
So,

533
00:23:28,470 --> 00:23:29,710
I went out to gamble.

534
00:23:29,730 --> 00:23:31,110
You have a severe headache,

535
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:32,180
and you still think of gambling?

536
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:34,100
I'm about to see the King of hell.

537
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:35,360
But the dice

538
00:23:35,530 --> 00:23:37,300
are always calling me!

539
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:39,170
Kid, I...

540
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:47,130
-My head hurts! -Dad. Dad.

541
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:48,930
Let me give you a massage.

542
00:23:57,730 --> 00:23:59,100
Your father is also an extraordinary man.

543
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:01,100
He looks rough,

544
00:24:01,930 --> 00:24:02,910
but the meat

545
00:24:03,250 --> 00:24:04,500
was cut so carefully.

546
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:06,280
All five layers of meat are distinct.

547
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:07,780
Every cut has followed the rules.

548
00:24:08,170 --> 00:24:09,090
Of course!

549
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:10,770
Otherwise, why do people call him Carver Hu?

550
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:15,780
Go, go, go!

551
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:17,700
Other people's cats love fish,

552
00:24:17,930 --> 00:24:19,600
but our cat loves pork.

553
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:20,740
And no amount of meat is enough.

554
00:24:23,530 --> 00:24:24,300
Take care.

555
00:24:24,650 --> 00:24:25,630
Take care, Sheriff.

556
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:31,960
Do you know how many gambling houses

557
00:24:32,110 --> 00:24:32,900
are there in the county?

558
00:24:33,530 --> 00:24:34,170
Yes!

559
00:24:34,330 --> 00:24:35,250
Find out

560
00:24:35,610 --> 00:24:36,780
whether Carver Hu gambled that night!

561
00:24:37,110 --> 00:24:37,510
Yes!

562
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:42,390
Stay in the icehouse alone

563
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:43,420
for eight hours,

564
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:44,980
and won't let anyone in to help you.

565
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:46,660
You can't be like that coroner

566
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:47,820
40 years ago,

567
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:49,820
and hang yourself in a couple of days.

568
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:53,610
I came all the way

569
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:55,310
to help you examine the body.

570
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:58,040
My hips almost broke on the way.

571
00:24:58,060 --> 00:24:59,200
And you still make fun of me?

572
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,150
I'm afraid

573
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,040
if you don't solve the case

574
00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:05,580
in seven days,

575
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:08,990
you can't face the people of Ju County.

576
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:11,370
Whether we can solve this case

577
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:13,390
depends on

578
00:25:13,730 --> 00:25:14,890
your autopsy results.

579
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,540
I'm afraid I'll let you down.

580
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:19,250
There are not many clues.

581
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:23,720
Was the dead girl

582
00:25:24,550 --> 00:25:25,410
raped?

583
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:27,020
No.

584
00:25:27,130 --> 00:25:27,850
Did she get beaten up?

585
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:28,990
Any obvious wounds on her

586
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:30,500
or any signs of poisoning?

587
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:34,690
No.

588
00:25:35,810 --> 00:25:37,150
The murderer killed her with one cut.

589
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:38,370
And the murder weapon

590
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,660
and dismemberment weapon

591
00:25:39,690 --> 00:25:40,820
are indistinguishable.

592
00:25:41,150 --> 00:25:44,010
The murderer has a complete set of knives,

593
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:45,180
and is skillful.

594
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:46,180
His heart

595
00:25:46,950 --> 00:25:48,710
is extremely cold.

596
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,680
Could it really be him?

597
00:25:58,610 --> 00:26:00,030
But 40 years ago,

598
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:01,620
he was only 11 years old.

599
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:03,480
He just learned how to butcher pigs

600
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:06,010
and practiced his skills on humen?

601
00:26:06,970 --> 00:26:08,200
Who are you talking about?

602
00:26:09,670 --> 00:26:11,110
The most famous butcher here,

603
00:26:11,370 --> 00:26:12,120
Carver Hu.

604
00:26:14,750 --> 00:26:15,380
Sheriff Lu!

605
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:18,060
Sheriff Lu！

606
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:19,350
A scout reported that

607
00:26:19,830 --> 00:26:20,870
Carver Hu ran away!

608
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:23,040
He left the county with a package.

609
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:23,860
What!

610
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:34,350
Stop!

611
00:26:39,210 --> 00:26:40,220
Please spare me.

612
00:26:41,590 --> 00:26:43,130
Please spare me, spear me!

613
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:44,750
Please!

614
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:48,340
Please spare my life!

615
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:56,920
Yes, I did come to Lady Hui.

616
00:26:57,780 --> 00:27:00,730
But I really didn't kill her!

617
00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:02,620
Still lying.

618
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:04,260
Looks like

619
00:27:04,730 --> 00:27:06,300
we can only torture him.

620
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:06,900
Guards!

621
00:27:06,990 --> 00:27:07,590
Yes.

622
00:27:08,970 --> 00:27:10,630
Don't hit me! Don't hit me!

623
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:13,380
My head hurts!

624
00:27:16,130 --> 00:27:18,100
Carver Hu, raise your head.

625
00:27:19,950 --> 00:27:22,830
You said you went to Lady Hui.

626
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:23,990
What happened?

627
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:28,640
What?

628
00:27:29,930 --> 00:27:32,280
He secretly had a concubine behind your back.

629
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:36,600
That woman is much prettier than me!

630
00:27:36,850 --> 00:27:39,460
Dad, what should I do?

631
00:27:40,730 --> 00:27:41,880
Dad!

632
00:27:42,730 --> 00:27:43,400
That day,

633
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:45,190
I found Qian Xiaoyi

634
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:46,860
in his residence in the north of the county.

635
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:48,500
Leave!

636
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:49,680
What are you doing?

637
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:51,650
Good for you, Qian Xiaoyi!

638
00:27:51,910 --> 00:27:52,550
You don't want me anymore

639
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:53,730
after the novelty has passed, right?

640
00:27:54,050 --> 00:27:54,640
Fine!

641
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:55,380
Let me tell you.

642
00:27:55,410 --> 00:27:56,590
I'll kill you!

643
00:27:56,740 --> 00:27:58,010
-Go away! -I'll kill you!

644
00:27:58,260 --> 00:27:59,110
We agreed

645
00:27:59,830 --> 00:28:01,080
it was just a fling.

646
00:28:01,170 --> 00:28:02,550
I can't divorce my wife and marry you.

647
00:28:03,310 --> 00:28:04,510
My wife and my father-in-law

648
00:28:05,530 --> 00:28:06,290
are both not easy to deal with.

649
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:07,250
Besides,

650
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:09,460
my wife is a bit fierce,

651
00:28:09,870 --> 00:28:10,580
but she

652
00:28:10,610 --> 00:28:11,930
truly loves me.

653
00:28:11,590 --> 00:28:14,100
[Qian Xiaoyi's concubine Lady Hui]

654
00:28:12,070 --> 00:28:13,340
I can't abandon her.

655
00:28:14,210 --> 00:28:14,800
Fine.

656
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:15,980
Then you are heartless to me,

657
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:16,490
right?

658
00:28:16,690 --> 00:28:17,420
You're heartless!

659
00:28:17,450 --> 00:28:18,760
I'll give you more money!

660
00:28:19,110 --> 00:28:20,260
-What did you say? -If you keep pestering me,

661
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:22,350
I won't let you off easily!

662
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:22,710
I...

663
00:28:28,110 --> 00:28:29,390
I wanted to

664
00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:31,100
to teach him a lesson.

665
00:28:31,670 --> 00:28:32,670
But I didn't expect

666
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:35,820
he was no longer under Hui's charm.

667
00:28:36,770 --> 00:28:38,450
He even praised my daughter.

668
00:28:39,730 --> 00:28:41,180
When I was happy,

669
00:28:41,370 --> 00:28:43,390
I just wanted to buy some good wine and dishes

670
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:44,790
and have a drink with him.

671
00:28:46,130 --> 00:28:48,460
After all, I'm dying.

672
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:51,940
I have to leave my daughter to him.

673
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:52,750
-That one. -This one?

674
00:28:52,770 --> 00:28:53,490
Let me tell you.

675
00:28:53,780 --> 00:28:55,240
-It's a big deal. -You have a good taste.

676
00:28:55,810 --> 00:28:56,690
If you are willing,

677
00:28:56,980 --> 00:28:58,380
we can work together.

678
00:28:58,540 --> 00:28:59,580
-Thank you, sir. -Let me tell you.

679
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:00,400
Qian Xiaoyi

680
00:29:00,630 --> 00:29:01,540
is generous.

681
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:02,690
He gave me 10 thousand coins

682
00:29:03,050 --> 00:29:04,600
a month.

683
00:29:05,150 --> 00:29:06,080
Such a good deal,

684
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:06,960
we can't lose it.

685
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:08,420
Tomorrow,

686
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:09,800
I'll introduce a new girl to him.

687
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:11,170
What about Lady Hui?

688
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:12,300
She's in a hurry to get married.

689
00:29:12,330 --> 00:29:13,530
That's why I came to you.

690
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:16,820
You pimp!

691
00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:18,030
You always break other people's marriages!

692
00:29:18,330 --> 00:29:19,710
I'll kill you.

693
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:20,780
What are you doing?

694
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:22,130
-I'll kill you! -Stop!

695
00:29:22,170 --> 00:29:22,910
What are you doing?

696
00:29:22,950 --> 00:29:23,580
Stop!

697
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:24,610
Hurry up! Hurry!

698
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:25,660
Guys, they are fighting.

699
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:28,040
I remembered.

700
00:29:28,190 --> 00:29:28,800
That was him!

701
00:29:29,290 --> 00:29:29,850
That day,

702
00:29:30,210 --> 00:29:31,490
we were on duty,

703
00:29:32,050 --> 00:29:33,120
and asked him why he hit them.

704
00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:34,060
He wouldn't tell us.

705
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:36,100
So we took him to the detective house

706
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:36,860
for a night.

707
00:29:37,310 --> 00:29:38,290
Why didn't you tell me

708
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:39,900
when I came to your house that day?

709
00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:42,960
It's not a good thing after all.

710
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:44,260
Then why did you run?

711
00:29:44,850 --> 00:29:46,820
I owe so much gambling debts.

712
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:49,620
Look what they

713
00:29:49,650 --> 00:29:51,380
did to me!

714
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:53,080
That's also true.

715
00:29:53,540 --> 00:29:55,540
When I went to gambling houses that day,

716
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:57,740
the owners all said he owed a lot of gambling debts.

717
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:00,540
Carver Hu.

718
00:30:01,170 --> 00:30:03,240
What's the color of your cat?

719
00:30:04,210 --> 00:30:04,710
Cat?

720
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:09,190
That cat I have is a Chinese Li Hua.

721
00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:10,890
Is that true?

722
00:30:15,130 --> 00:30:15,590
Yes.

723
00:30:18,530 --> 00:30:19,650
Go find Qian Xiaoyi,

724
00:30:19,850 --> 00:30:21,750
and ask him to pay off his father-in-law's gambling debt.

725
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:23,180
What if he refuses?

726
00:30:23,420 --> 00:30:24,260
If he refuses,

727
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:25,840
tell him

728
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:27,010
that he is involved in Lady Hui's death.

729
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:28,470
I will put him in jail

730
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:29,260
to wait for a trial.

731
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:30,390
Su Wuming.

732
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:31,990
Can we do that?

733
00:30:32,530 --> 00:30:33,970
I'm the Military Commander of the city,

734
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:35,530
not a local official.

735
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:37,290
Just scare him with my words and my identity.

736
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:37,980
It doesn't matter.

737
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:39,100
I'll do it right away.

738
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:40,470
Then,

739
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:42,080
thank you, Commander Su!

740
00:30:42,110 --> 00:30:43,180
I kowtow to you.

741
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,160
I kowtow to you!

742
00:30:44,290 --> 00:30:45,730
No need.

743
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:47,950
But you have to promise me

744
00:30:47,990 --> 00:30:48,940
you won't gamble again.

745
00:30:49,170 --> 00:30:49,740
If you go to the gumble house again,

746
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:51,300
I won't let you off easily.

747
00:30:53,660 --> 00:30:54,420
Su Wuming.

748
00:30:54,850 --> 00:30:56,210
Why did you ask him about the cat?

749
00:30:57,780 --> 00:30:59,100
During the autopsy,

750
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:01,340
I found five cat hair.

751
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:02,670
Three of them are yellow.

752
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:03,960
And one black and one white.

753
00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:05,340
Keep it.

754
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:16,380
Besides,

755
00:31:17,420 --> 00:31:18,580
there is a smell of herbs

756
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:21,070
on the body bag.

757
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:22,700
About what kinds of herbs are they,

758
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:24,540
you need to ask Chicken Fed.

759
00:31:24,810 --> 00:31:26,180
I smelled the herbs too.

760
00:31:26,770 --> 00:31:28,010
But Fed got drunk

761
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:28,720
when he arrived.

762
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:30,620
I'm afraid

763
00:31:31,030 --> 00:31:32,060
I can't wake him up today.

764
00:31:36,970 --> 00:31:38,050
[Hall of Life]

765
00:31:41,130 --> 00:31:44,880
Fed Thirteen.

766
00:31:46,930 --> 00:31:50,310
Fed Thirteen.

767
00:31:54,060 --> 00:31:57,980
Fed Thirteen.

768
00:32:24,490 --> 00:32:25,250
Fed Thirteen,

769
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:26,360
Come here!

770
00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:36,820
Elder fellow?

771
00:32:37,090 --> 00:32:38,550
It's, it's only been decades.

772
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:40,240
How did you grow so old?

773
00:32:43,610 --> 00:32:44,800
How can you say I am old?

774
00:32:45,010 --> 00:32:46,010
Look at yourself.

775
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:47,420
You are older than me.

776
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:48,540
Why didn't you meet me first

777
00:32:48,590 --> 00:32:49,930
when you came to my Hall of Life!

778
00:32:50,250 --> 00:32:50,730
I...

779
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:51,510
What!

780
00:32:51,730 --> 00:32:52,780
Have you forgotten how many times

781
00:32:53,050 --> 00:32:54,460
I took the punishment for you

782
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:55,800
from our master?

783
00:32:57,540 --> 00:32:58,750
You Old Weirdo,

784
00:32:58,980 --> 00:32:59,980
It's been years.

785
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:01,120
Why mention it?

786
00:33:01,150 --> 00:33:02,910
You forget but I can't!

787
00:33:04,470 --> 00:33:05,740
You promised me

788
00:33:06,110 --> 00:33:07,510
to write books and refine medicine with me

789
00:33:07,540 --> 00:33:08,540
for the rest of your life.

790
00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:10,060
Since you're here,

791
00:33:10,610 --> 00:33:12,350
you can't leave anymore.

792
00:33:12,510 --> 00:33:13,510
Let's go.

793
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:21,860
Fed!

794
00:33:22,490 --> 00:33:23,130
Fed!

795
00:33:27,030 --> 00:33:27,520
Fed!

796
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:28,660
Fed

797
00:33:34,060 --> 00:33:34,940
What happened!

798
00:33:36,170 --> 00:33:36,690
Fed,

799
00:33:37,060 --> 00:33:37,780
what's wrong?

800
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:39,260
What is this place?

801
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:41,320
Our place.

802
00:33:42,540 --> 00:33:43,300
Our place?

803
00:33:44,850 --> 00:33:46,210
Could this place be

804
00:33:46,890 --> 00:33:48,130
the Hall of Life?

805
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:50,140
This is the Hall of Life.

806
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:54,060
Did this use to be

807
00:33:54,530 --> 00:33:56,380
where doctors practiced medicine

808
00:33:56,530 --> 00:33:57,670
and sold medicine?

809
00:33:57,940 --> 00:33:58,380
Yes.

810
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:02,340
Is the owner

811
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:04,610
of this place

812
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:06,630
Meng Donglao?

813
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:07,300
That's right.

814
00:34:09,210 --> 00:34:10,210
This Old Weirdo.

815
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:11,670
No wonder he gave me a dream!

816
00:34:12,510 --> 00:34:13,139
Come on!

817
00:34:13,210 --> 00:34:13,949
Take me to him!

818
00:34:14,050 --> 00:34:15,000
Take me to him!

819
00:34:15,350 --> 00:34:16,159
He is not here.

820
00:34:16,699 --> 00:34:17,300
Why?

821
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:19,750
He died last year.

822
00:34:20,030 --> 00:34:21,199
Dead?

823
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:24,889
How could he have died?

824
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:26,889
He...

825
00:35:02,590 --> 00:35:04,560
I have just been here.

826
00:35:05,410 --> 00:35:06,020
Fed.

827
00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:07,100
What are you talking about?

828
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:08,260
You were sleeping

829
00:35:08,290 --> 00:35:09,320
in your bed?

830
00:35:09,970 --> 00:35:10,800
Really!

831
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:12,860
Meng Donglao is inside.

832
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:17,980
Fed.

833
00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:19,630
You have drank too much again.

834
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:20,740
Go back to sleep.

835
00:35:21,690 --> 00:35:22,330
Don't scare Xijun.

836
00:35:22,350 --> 00:35:22,990
But...

837
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:25,900
But...

838
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:27,150
Alright, go back to sleep.

839
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:27,820
But!

840
00:35:28,470 --> 00:35:28,870
This...

841
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:29,580
Let's go.

842
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:41,330
A tomb in the attic?

843
00:35:41,620 --> 00:35:43,060
Is there such a strange thing!

844
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:45,100
Yes.

845
00:35:45,890 --> 00:35:47,580
Dr. Zhai is a filial son.

846
00:35:48,010 --> 00:35:48,530
So,

847
00:35:49,290 --> 00:35:50,570
I hid it for him.

848
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:53,000
Judging from what happened just now,

849
00:35:53,510 --> 00:35:55,310
Chicken Fed and Meng Donglao

850
00:35:55,450 --> 00:35:56,510
must be old friends.

851
00:35:57,650 --> 00:36:00,420
When he heard you came to Ju County that day,

852
00:36:01,130 --> 00:36:03,150
he looked in a trance

853
00:36:03,190 --> 00:36:04,070
and hemmed and hawed.

854
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:05,850
I think he has long known

855
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:07,480
that Meng Donglao is here.

856
00:36:07,730 --> 00:36:09,410
And their friendship

857
00:36:10,070 --> 00:36:12,110
must be extraordinary.

858
00:36:14,150 --> 00:36:15,080
Looks like Fed

859
00:36:15,570 --> 00:36:16,130
still has a lot of secrets

860
00:36:16,170 --> 00:36:17,930
that haven't told us.

861
00:36:27,370 --> 00:36:28,020
Alright.

862
00:36:28,250 --> 00:36:29,260
Guys, don't bother to come any further.

863
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:30,600
Goodbye.

864
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:34,380
What?

865
00:36:35,030 --> 00:36:36,250
Aren't you going back to Nanzhou?

866
00:36:36,990 --> 00:36:38,350
I'll leave her here

867
00:36:38,510 --> 00:36:39,900
to supervise this case for me.

868
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:40,670
Her?

869
00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:42,370
Supervise?

870
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:46,210
I will do my duty diligently.

871
00:36:46,340 --> 00:36:47,280
Please rest assured.

872
00:36:48,580 --> 00:36:50,320
You don't know.

873
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:51,650
Miss. Xijun

874
00:36:51,870 --> 00:36:52,630
is

875
00:36:52,660 --> 00:36:54,520
the daughter of Assistant Minister Pei.

876
00:36:54,850 --> 00:36:56,930
She is now working for Commander Sue.

877
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:58,490
She is the perfect candidate

878
00:36:58,820 --> 00:37:00,120
to supervise this case.

879
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:01,300
Sheriff Lu,

880
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,430
you have to report the daily progress of the case

881
00:37:03,940 --> 00:37:06,210
to Xijun.

882
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:24,630
What can you supervise?

883
00:37:24,930 --> 00:37:25,660
You will only cause more trouble.

884
00:37:27,050 --> 00:37:27,580
Master.

885
00:37:28,350 --> 00:37:28,870
My lady

886
00:37:28,910 --> 00:37:29,770
can take care of you.

887
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:30,930
When you're busy investigating the case,

888
00:37:31,030 --> 00:37:32,560
you often forget to eat all day.

889
00:37:32,780 --> 00:37:33,620
-And… -You don't get to say anything here.

890
00:37:34,180 --> 00:37:34,590
Get out!

891
00:37:46,270 --> 00:37:47,170
Are you mad?

892
00:37:48,390 --> 00:37:49,220
If you are here,

893
00:37:49,820 --> 00:37:51,200
it will only make my colleagues

894
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:52,000
laugh at me.

895
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:55,310
What if I can

896
00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:56,270
find something for myself to do?

897
00:37:56,660 --> 00:37:57,900
What can you find to do?

898
00:37:58,340 --> 00:37:59,220
Tell me.

899
00:38:00,140 --> 00:38:01,580
I heard that

900
00:38:01,790 --> 00:38:02,640
someone saw the one

901
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:04,180
who secretly put the body bag in the temple.

902
00:38:04,580 --> 00:38:05,680
I want to draw it out.

903
00:38:10,270 --> 00:38:11,270
That makes sense.

904
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:12,260
Why didn't I think of that?

905
00:38:14,380 --> 00:38:15,180
In that case,

906
00:38:16,550 --> 00:38:17,660
thank you, Miss. Pei.

907
00:38:19,550 --> 00:38:19,990
No.

908
00:38:21,980 --> 00:38:22,860
It's Inspector Pei.

909
00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:25,220
You're welcome, Sheriff Lu.

910
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:37,160
Fed.

911
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:43,210
Fed!

912
00:38:47,250 --> 00:38:47,930
A few days ago,

913
00:38:48,410 --> 00:38:49,450
there was a jar of wine dug out

914
00:38:49,730 --> 00:38:50,800
in the backyard of the county government.

915
00:38:53,110 --> 00:38:54,750
And that jar was wrapped tightly by cloth.

916
00:38:55,550 --> 00:38:56,670
It seems to be

917
00:38:56,870 --> 00:38:58,060
some medicinal liquor with a great tonic effect.

918
00:38:58,820 --> 00:38:59,770
But no one knows

919
00:39:00,330 --> 00:39:01,790
what kind of medicinal liquor it is.

920
00:39:02,910 --> 00:39:03,990
Fetch me some to drink

921
00:39:04,020 --> 00:39:05,130
and you'll know.

922
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:07,050
Of course, someone has tasted it.

923
00:39:07,070 --> 00:39:08,630
Then why bother bringing it up?

924
00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:13,340
I made a bet with someone.

925
00:39:13,450 --> 00:39:14,580
I said I have a close friend

926
00:39:14,890 --> 00:39:15,690
that doesn't need to drink the wine

927
00:39:15,980 --> 00:39:16,900
with only a smell of

928
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:18,320
the cloth of the jar

929
00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:20,320
and he will know

930
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:21,420
what kinds of herbs are in this wine.

931
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:23,540
Then...

932
00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:26,310
It's your bet.

933
00:39:26,340 --> 00:39:27,570
What's in it for me?

934
00:39:30,370 --> 00:39:32,260
Our wager is a three-day feast,

935
00:39:32,740 --> 00:39:34,040
and drink whatever good wine you want.

936
00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:34,900
Really?

937
00:39:35,530 --> 00:39:37,260
Bring the cloth

938
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:37,860
for me

939
00:39:38,060 --> 00:39:39,780
to smell it! Hurry up!

940
00:39:40,820 --> 00:39:41,480
Deal?

941
00:39:41,590 --> 00:39:42,390
Hurry up!

942
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:53,060
It smells a bit weird.

943
00:39:55,580 --> 00:39:56,680
It only has the smell of medicine.

944
00:39:57,100 --> 00:39:58,540
No smell of alcohol.

945
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:00,190
Is this really

946
00:40:00,220 --> 00:40:01,500
that cloth wrapped around that wine jar?

947
00:40:02,420 --> 00:40:03,860
Yes, yes.

948
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:09,720
Gastrodia elata.

949
00:40:12,890 --> 00:40:14,700
And there seems to be...

950
00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:18,950
Xue Huan.

951
00:40:20,230 --> 00:40:21,910
What's with that expression?

952
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:25,370
No, nothing.

953
00:40:27,370 --> 00:40:28,010
No!

954
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:31,800
It's only been half a month since you came to Ju County.

955
00:40:31,980 --> 00:40:32,770
Little boy,

956
00:40:33,060 --> 00:40:34,860
why do you seem to have learned something bad?

957
00:40:37,770 --> 00:40:39,680
My master has been teaching me good stuff.

958
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:43,980
All right, you can leave now.

959
00:40:44,270 --> 00:40:45,970
I can't smell it when you watch me here.

960
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:02,940
When I came out after burning the first stick of incense,

961
00:41:03,140 --> 00:41:04,980
I saw her entering the Destiny Temple.

962
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:06,870
That old woman...

963
00:41:07,370 --> 00:41:09,260
looks familiar.

964
00:41:09,590 --> 00:41:11,150
I seem to have seen her somewhere,

965
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:12,980
but I can't remember.

966
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:15,160
But

967
00:41:15,250 --> 00:41:17,130
I felt she was a little weird.

968
00:41:19,740 --> 00:41:20,340
Don't worry.

969
00:41:20,660 --> 00:41:21,540
Take your time.

970
00:41:22,020 --> 00:41:23,050
Is her hair white?

971
00:41:25,190 --> 00:41:26,150
Her head was wrapped in a long scarf.

972
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:28,140
But I could see that

973
00:41:28,190 --> 00:41:28,750
her hair is white.

974
00:41:34,460 --> 00:41:35,420
Think it over carefully.

975
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:36,410
What was wrong

976
00:41:36,780 --> 00:41:38,480
with Lady Hui these days?

who else

979
00:41:40,940 --> 00:41:41,520
had she seen?

980
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:43,390

[Mother of Lady Hui]

982
00:41:43,420 --> 00:41:44,890
she had only been with that Qian,

983
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:46,710
and often went to his house in the north of the county.

984
00:41:47,730 --> 00:41:49,910
When she went back, all she did was sleep in her room.

985
00:41:50,710 --> 00:41:52,110
What eles was that every three days,

986
00:41:52,140 --> 00:41:53,780
she would went to have acupuncture.

987
00:41:53,820 --> 00:41:54,570
Acupuncture?

988
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:56,690
She had a headache too.

989
00:41:57,520 --> 00:42:00,020
This disease is not rare in this county.

990
00:42:00,890 --> 00:42:02,360
But it's rare

991
00:42:02,490 --> 00:42:03,520
at her age.

992
00:42:04,060 --> 00:42:07,170
So she often went to the clinic during these months.

993
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:08,470
Which clinic?

994

00:42:13,220 --> 00:42:14,900
I was sweeping the floor.

I saw that old man passing by me

997

with a package.

998
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:20,300
I didn't pay much attention to him.

999
00:42:21,150 --> 00:42:22,280
Now that I think about it,

1000
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:24,760
that old man seems to have the smell of medicine.

1001

And he's short,

lady Hui didn't come to here.

00:45:08,180 --> 00:45:10,380
♫For the memory of grace♫

1043
00:45:11,310 --> 00:45:13,680
♫And the resentment is not yet over♫

1044
00:45:14,670 --> 00:45:20,110
♫The rivers and mountains are immortal, the clouds are overturned♫

1045
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:27,250
♫To be consoled by the truth, even with thorns on my back♫

1046
00:45:27,560 --> 00:45:31,960
♫Only for justice♫

1047
00:45:33,930 --> 00:45:40,210
♫That I seek a truth for this long, lonely night♫

1048
00:45:40,490 --> 00:45:46,380
♫The heaven and earth are held together by a strong will♫

1049
00:45:47,420 --> 00:45:49,480
♫The people are in peace♫

1050
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:53,930
♫Carving right and wrong into a clear heart♫

1051
00:45:54,660 --> 00:45:56,020
♫The truth♫

1052
00:45:56,050 --> 00:45:59,780
♫Will reinterpret this justice♫

1053
00:46:00,040 --> 00:46:06,140
♫Even if there are a thousand sails, it's not a waste of time♫

1054
00:46:06,510 --> 00:46:12,700
♫What I am afraid of is the unrighted wrong♫

1055
00:46:13,310 --> 00:46:15,230
♫What is the meaning of life and death?♫

1056
00:46:15,450 --> 00:46:19,580
♫I'll paint the sunshine into the landscape♫

1057
00:46:19,900 --> 00:46:21,620
♫The spirit of righteousness♫

1058
00:46:21,770 --> 00:46:25,190
♫Exists for the one I care♫
