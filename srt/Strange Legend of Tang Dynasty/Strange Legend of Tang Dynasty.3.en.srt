[Episode 3]

4
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:46,460
Not bad.

5
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:47,820
Delicious.

6
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:52,979
How many pieces left?

7
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:55,020
Try this.

8
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:55,470
Here.

9
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:58,340
Let me propose a toast to all of you.

10
00:01:58,360 --> 00:01:59,930
Come on.

11
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:05,780
I've written the co-investigation documents

12
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:06,710
with Wannian County.

13
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:08,830
After your meal,

14
00:02:09,009 --> 00:02:10,740
you can get down to business.

15
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:11,990
You say we can dig out bodies

16
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:13,540
in the places you marked.

17
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:14,860
What if we can't?

18
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:16,130
It would be a waste of effort.

19
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,970
My wife is going to give birth soon.

20
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:21,530
Giving birth is a big deal.

21
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:24,060
I have poor eyesight.

22
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:24,980
I'm afraid I can't

23
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:26,690
handle this.

24
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:29,340
Why don't you get treated earlier?

25
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:32,070
If you're blind, even if you see a famous doctor,

26
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:33,700
that will be in vain.

27
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:34,430
I...

28
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:37,120
I'm timid.

29
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:38,810
Actually, not timid.

30
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:41,230
I have a mother.

31
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:44,950
You have to be a good son.

32
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:46,320
That's good.

33
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:50,060
But you need money to take care of your mother, right?

34
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:53,480
And you need money to cure your eyes, right?

35
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:55,210
Yes.

36
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:58,410
Bring more money home.

37
00:02:58,610 --> 00:02:59,590
If your wife is happy,

38
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:01,690
she'll definitely give birth smoothly.

39
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:03,100
We will be paid?

40
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:04,100
How much?

41
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:05,070
That's right.

42
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:05,820
How much?

43
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:07,810
How much? How much?

44
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:08,750
Tell me.

45
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:09,790
So far,

46
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:12,430
there have been eight brides missing.

47
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,420
It is unclear whether they are alive or not.

48
00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:17,390
Although someone paid a lot,

49
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:20,910
I don't want you to find it troublesome.

50
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:22,030
How about...

51
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:23,620
Sheriff Su.

52
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:25,100
This is our duty.

53
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:26,000
There's nothing troublesome.

54
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:26,860
That's right.

55
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:28,050
Thank you for your hospitality.

56
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,070
We will do our best.

57
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:30,870
Yes, we will.

58
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:34,060
Thank you.

59
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:36,220
I'll wait

60
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:38,570
for your good news.

61
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:40,120
-Come out. -Go.

62
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:41,410
Go!

63
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:43,550
Get out of the way.

64
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:44,410
Why this cruel?

65
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:45,140
Go over there.

66
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:46,020
Hurry!

67
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:47,050
-Squat down. -Hurry!

68
00:03:48,210 --> 00:03:48,670
Hurry!

69
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:49,630
This is a serious crime.

70
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:50,730
Yes.

71
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:52,980
This must be serious.

72
00:03:58,130 --> 00:03:59,690
Why are there so many Imperial Guards?

73
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:01,690
So Chang'an black tea is demon tea.

74
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:04,770
[Notice]

75
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:03,540
An enchanter used tea to deceive people

76
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:04,770
and caused death.

77
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:06,670
He who hides or sells Chang'an black tea would be sentenced to death.

78
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:08,650
General,

79
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:10,050
this man has been selling

80
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:10,980
Chang'an black tea in the hotel.

81
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:12,300
Many people are witnesses.

82
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:13,350
Put him into the prison.

83
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:16,269
We'll convict him

84
00:04:16,829 --> 00:04:17,709
after he confesses everything.

85
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:18,740
-Please spare my life, General. -Move.

86
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,540
I'm just doing a small business.

87
00:04:21,019 --> 00:04:21,690
General.

88
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:22,980
General, please spare me!

89
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:24,660
Our stocks in both the East and West markets

90
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:25,440
were confiscated.

91
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:27,090
It's said that many shops

92
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:27,860
sold counterfeits.

93
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,350
What a joke.

94
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:32,400
If Lu Lingfeng is still alive,

95
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:33,340
our life

96
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,250
will be hard.

97
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:36,610
We have found out his whereabouts.

98
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:37,659
Immortal Venerable,

99
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:39,159
please give the instruction.

100
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:33,170
Greetings, Immortal Venerable.

101
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:42,090
You've slept for too long.

102
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:44,750
It's time to exercise.

103
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:49,950
The imperial court is talking about

104
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:53,170
that the Imperial Guards are not in charge of the tea.

105
00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:54,960
Why are you doing so?

106
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,370
Great General,

107
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,630
I didn't decide on my own.

108
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:03,840
[Lu Tong, Great General of Imperial Guards]

109
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:03,540
Do you mean that this is

110
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:05,860
His Highness' order?

111
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:08,380
Is there any instruction written by himself?

112
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,360
Today in the court,

113
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:15,360
His Majesty asked,

114
00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:17,590
but His Highness didn't say a word.

115
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:20,480
What else do you want to defend?

116
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:23,430
Many imperial officials

117
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:24,810
died mysteriously.

118
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,860
This must be highly related to Chang'an black tea.

119
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:28,620
Great General,

120
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:30,290
please let me find out the truth.

121
00:06:30,730 --> 00:06:31,900
I can let you investigate.

122
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,320
But I'm afraid

123
00:06:34,090 --> 00:06:36,290
this may ruin your bright future.

124
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:39,540
I have no regrets.

125
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:52,740
Don't embarrass His Majesty.

126
00:06:53,210 --> 00:06:53,950
If so,

127
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,720
no one can save your life.

128
00:07:01,890 --> 00:07:02,960
You can investigate the case,

129
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,130
but stop deploying the Imperial Guards.

130
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:22,730
Sheriff Su is really a genius.

131
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:24,180
By just thinking about it,

132
00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:26,290
he can find where bodies are buried.

133
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:27,990
I heard that

134
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:29,290
he was a disciple of Detective Di.

135
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:30,550
It seems

136
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:33,010
that's true.

137
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:34,540
He agreed to pay us.

138
00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:36,330
I don't know when I'll get it.

139
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:38,470
How about asking?

140
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:40,070
Ask what?

141
00:07:40,409 --> 00:07:41,280
Can't you see he is examining the corpses?

142
00:07:41,890 --> 00:07:42,650
Disciple of Detective Di

143
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:43,840
will definitely pay us as he promised.

144
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:45,050
From now on,

145
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:46,960
we need to follow the sheriff.

146
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,080
Stop slacking off.

147
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:52,070
Sheriff Su.

148
00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:54,680
-Magistrate. -Magistrate

149
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:56,790
-Magistrate. -Magistrate.

150
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:00,510
Magistrate Yuan, what brings you here?

151
00:08:00,890 --> 00:08:02,330
I heard.

152
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:05,360
You were taught well by Detective Di.

153
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:06,570
You have great foresight.

154
00:08:06,970 --> 00:08:09,420
It was surprising that you found all these corpses.

155
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:10,970
Any clues about the culprit?

156
00:08:11,730 --> 00:08:13,050
I found these bodies

157
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:14,530
by coincidence.

158
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:16,700
As for the culprit, I have no idea yet.

159
00:08:17,010 --> 00:08:18,570
It's already very impressive.

160
00:08:18,730 --> 00:08:20,370
Your achievements today

161
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:22,780
will contribute to your great career.

162
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,400
Very soon.

163
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:26,430
Sheriff Su,

164
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:28,950
I have something important to discuss.

165
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:30,560
Please come with me.

166
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:36,390
The Imperial Guards

167
00:08:36,429 --> 00:08:37,500
have captured tea dealers.

168
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:39,710
But they caught too many.

169
00:08:41,059 --> 00:08:43,210
The Imperial Prison is overburdened.

170
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:46,150
So they sent many people here.

171
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,200
How should we arrange them?

172
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,720
Are you asking me?

173
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:54,360
Yes.

174
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:56,640
You served Detective Di for years.

175
00:08:57,050 --> 00:08:58,410
You are more knowledgeable than me.

176
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:01,790
Let them go.

177
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,180
Release them?

178
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:06,910
The Imperial Guards have crossed the line.

179
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:09,350
Besides, the Imperial Prison is not small.

180
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:11,530
Suspects of this case

181
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:12,900
shouldn't be sent

182
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:14,230
to our county.

183
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:16,690
Yes.

184
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:20,710
But I heard

185
00:09:20,770 --> 00:09:22,450
that General Lu, who arrested them,

186
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,170
is with His Highness.

187
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:27,700
Will we offend His Highness?

188
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,640
I heard

189
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:31,130
that Her Highness

190
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:32,820
also drinks Chang'an black tea.

191
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:35,880
If Chang'an County makes a fuss,

192
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:39,540
I'm afraid we may offend Her Highness.

193
00:09:46,010 --> 00:09:47,840
Thank you for reminding me.

194
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:49,710
I know what to do.

195
00:09:50,770 --> 00:09:51,460
General.

196
00:09:51,570 --> 00:09:52,640
The Great General forbids you to deploy the troops.

197
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,230
So how do we attack the Ghost Market tonight

198
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:56,390
to investigate the source of the demon tea?

199
00:09:59,130 --> 00:10:00,240
We have to give up.

200
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:03,400
The three of us are willing to follow General.

201
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:08,770
Go back and rest.

202
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:11,780
Let me think about it.

203
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:21,910
One more thing.

204
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,210
Something interesting happens

205
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:26,350
in Chang'an County.

206
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:28,140
It seems

207
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:29,130
that Su Wuming really has some theurgy.

208
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:32,580
What do you mean?

209
00:10:33,310 --> 00:10:34,790
He drew something randomly on the map,

210
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:36,180
and then constables dug out

211
00:10:36,210 --> 00:10:36,900
eight bodies.

212
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:39,030
They are all the missing brides.

213
00:10:44,650 --> 00:10:45,740
Greetings, General.

214
00:10:48,830 --> 00:10:51,250
Your forehead turned black.

215
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,910
You must have stayed up all night.

216
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:54,220
You can read fortune?

217
00:10:55,390 --> 00:10:55,800
Tell me.

218
00:10:56,510 --> 00:10:57,520
How did you infer

219
00:10:57,540 --> 00:10:58,640
where the eight bodies were?

220
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:00,710
Did Di Renjie

221
00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:02,540
taught you any unique skill?

222
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:06,010
What unique skill?

223
00:11:06,730 --> 00:11:08,960
I just found this case strange.

224
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:11,470
So I read some

225
00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:12,960
folk tales.

226
00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:14,360
While reading,

227
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:16,410
I guessed something.

228
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:18,310
If you don't mind,

229
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:19,930
you can take them back.

230
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:21,590
They're quite interesting.

231
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:28,810
Pardon me.

232
00:11:29,530 --> 00:11:31,930
You are from the noble class in Fanyang.

233
00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:34,740
You people

234
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:36,180
may turn your nose up at these things.

235
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:39,990
I want to see

236
00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:41,590
what kind of nonsense

237
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:43,060
is recorded on it?

238
00:11:47,390 --> 00:11:49,050
I'm thirsty. Get me some water.

239
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:50,670
How can we treat General

240
00:11:50,770 --> 00:11:52,340
with water?

241
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:57,100
I have good tea.

242
00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:00,210
Mere half a liang tea cost me 3 ingots of silver.

243
00:12:00,310 --> 00:12:01,670
It's Chang'an black tea.

244
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:04,890
How dare you hide demon tea?

245
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:06,390
Where did you get the money to buy it?

246
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:08,650
General.

247
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:10,860
This is my home.

248
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:13,050
Even if you want to punish me,

249
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:15,040
you should show me some dignity.

250
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:18,590
It seems

251
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:20,700
that you've never had Chang'an black tea.

252
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:21,700
Of course not.

253
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:23,840
As the saying goes,

254
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:26,540
nothing ventured, nothing gained.

255
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:28,380
You don't even know

256
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:30,020
what Chang'an black tea is.

257
00:12:30,050 --> 00:12:32,590
How do you investigate this case?

258
00:13:04,890 --> 00:13:06,920
The tea is really expensive.

259
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:08,130
After you drink it,

260
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:09,270
you need to pay me.

261
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:12,470
I didn't drink it.

262
00:13:14,090 --> 00:13:15,330
This is your fault.

263
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:17,140
You said you were thirsty.

264
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:18,520
I made tea for you.

265
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:20,100
You have to pay me even if you didn't drink it.

266
00:13:20,530 --> 00:13:21,500
Are you a crazy beggar?

267
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:22,880
You're right.

268
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:24,750
I am indeed poor,

269
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:27,210
and also in debt.

270
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,280
Do you owe money because of this tea?

271
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:30,620
No.

272
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:33,520
Anyway, I owe money.

273
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,200
You earn a lot,

274
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:36,300
and can't spend it alone.

275
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:38,060
Give me some. I need it urgently.

276
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:44,820
Sheriff.

277
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:45,420
This...

278
00:13:46,090 --> 00:13:46,850
Really?

279
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:49,300
I, Su Wuming,

280
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:50,930
am a man of my word.

281
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:54,600
You share the money equally.

282
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:56,040
That's too much.

283
00:13:56,190 --> 00:13:56,630
This...

284
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:57,960
This is equal to your income for a month.

285
00:13:58,180 --> 00:13:59,600
We can't.

286
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:03,380
Yes, it is quite a lot

287
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:04,630
for me.

288
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:07,110
But for General,

289
00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:08,750
it means nothing.

290
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:10,580
General?

291
00:14:11,830 --> 00:14:12,660
Is he the famous

292
00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:13,680
General, Lu Lingfeng.

293
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:15,540
Yes he is.

294
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:18,530
So, the money was rewarded by General Lu?

295
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:19,820
Yes.

296
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:21,530
The Imperial Guards are superior.

297
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,470
General Lu is a trusted aide of His Highness.

298
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:24,540
How would he reward me?

299
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:25,430
Is there

300
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:27,430
anything we can do?

301
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,040
Yes.

302
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:35,500
Report!

303
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:39,650
Su Wuming, sheriff of Chang'an, requests a visit.

304
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:41,360
Let him in.

305
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:42,020
Yes.

306
00:14:58,110 --> 00:14:59,790
Su Wuming, sheriff of Chang'an.

307
00:14:59,810 --> 00:15:01,100
Greetings, General.

308
00:15:01,210 --> 00:15:01,650
What?

309
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:03,980
Haven't I paid you enough money?

310
00:15:04,590 --> 00:15:05,590
Are you here to ask for more?

311
00:15:06,310 --> 00:15:07,170
No.

312
00:15:07,630 --> 00:15:09,000
I'm here to send you troops.

313
00:15:10,170 --> 00:15:10,980
Troops?

314
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:14,370
I have many troops and officers.

315
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:16,370
But if we want to investigate the Ghost Market thoroughly,

316
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:17,860
I'm afraid that now General is unable

317
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,670
to deploy troops.

318
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:21,480
Su Wuming.

319
00:15:22,290 --> 00:15:24,030
You arranged a spy beside me.

320
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:28,570
You have led your army

321
00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:30,260
to search both markets.

322
00:15:30,290 --> 00:15:32,340
The Ghost Market should be the next.

323
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:33,440
But you haven't moved yet.

324
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:36,160
Isn't it because you have no troop to deploy?

325
00:15:39,050 --> 00:15:39,490
Fine.

326
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:41,520
Even if you're right,

327
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:43,470
but

328
00:15:43,990 --> 00:15:45,570
where did you get the troops?

329
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:48,910
There are 19 constables in Chang'an County.

330
00:15:49,050 --> 00:15:51,140
They are willing to follow your orders.

331
00:15:54,010 --> 00:15:55,030
Actually,

332
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:58,380
I would like to be the 20th.

333
00:15:59,530 --> 00:16:01,200
But as a scholar,

334
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:04,360
I'm afraid I'll be a burden to you.

335
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:29,020
Get out of the way!

336
00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:29,790
The Imperial Guards are ordered

337
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:31,070
to confiscate Chang'an black tea.

338
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:33,330
Anyone who hides or sells it will commit a felony.

339
00:16:33,370 --> 00:16:33,850
You!

340
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:34,700
Stand there. Don't move.

341
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:35,340
Get out of the way!

342
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:35,980
Don't move!

343
00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:37,180
Don't move!

344
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:37,900
Get out of the way!

345
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:38,500
Yes.

346
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:39,060
Don't move!

347
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:39,740
Get out of the way!

348
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:41,420
Look.

349
00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:42,850
Can I get a discount?

350
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:43,890
Manager!

351
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:47,530
Manager!

352
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:48,620
The Imperial Guards are looking for the black tea.

353
00:16:48,730 --> 00:16:49,670
They'll be here soon.

354
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:51,740
Lock the door. Now!

355
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:52,890
Take the black tea away from the back door.

356
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:54,620
No.

357
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:55,580
We have almost reached an agreement

358
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:56,220
on the price.

359
00:16:56,380 --> 00:16:57,590
I won't bargain anymore, okay?

360
00:16:57,650 --> 00:16:59,130
Sell the tea to me.

361
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:00,940
It's too late! The Imperial Guards are here!

362
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:01,890
I don't want to risk my life!

363
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:03,700
Don't go.

364
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:05,440
I can pay more.

365
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:08,020
Get out of the way!

366
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:08,660
Stand still!

367
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:09,540
Don't move.

368
00:17:28,170 --> 00:17:29,890
Chang'an black tea.

369
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:38,850
Wen Chao.

370
00:17:40,650 --> 00:17:41,790
Greetings, General.

371
00:17:41,950 --> 00:17:43,460
As a minister of the household,

372
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:45,290
you are here in the Ghost Market

373
00:17:45,290 --> 00:17:46,170
to buy demon tea?

374
00:17:46,170 --> 00:17:46,640
I...

375
00:17:46,670 --> 00:17:48,530
I just heard that the tea tastes good,

376
00:17:48,570 --> 00:17:49,640
so I was curious.

377
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:50,330
Tie them all up.

378
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:51,170
Yes.

379
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:52,390
No, no, no.

380
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:53,370
Don't.

381
00:17:53,390 --> 00:17:54,510
General Lu, please be lenient.

382
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:56,030
We're old friends.

383
00:18:02,990 --> 00:18:03,450
Get out of the way!

384
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:04,300
Go away!

385
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:05,740
Get out of the way!

386
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:06,290
Hurry!

387
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:08,020
Get out of the way! Move!

388
00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:20,100
Sheriff.

389
00:18:20,410 --> 00:18:21,400
Why didn't you investigate the case

390
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:23,470
with the Imperial Guards?

391
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:25,320
Why should I be with them?

392
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:27,780
To keep you safe.

393
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,170
Is the Ghost Market so scary?

394
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:33,420
It was General Lu

395
00:18:33,450 --> 00:18:35,210
who wanted to investigate Chang'an black tea.

396
00:18:35,370 --> 00:18:36,860
But the top priority of Chang'an County

397
00:18:36,890 --> 00:18:39,110
should be the disappearances of brides.

398
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:45,490
The source of the spice is still a mystery.

399
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:50,050
Both the East and West Markets have no clues.

400
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,400
If we still can't find any clues here in the Ghost Market,

401
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,410
the case is indeed ghostly.

402
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:01,710
General,

403
00:19:04,130 --> 00:19:05,770
you don't safeguard His Majesty

404
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,010
and patrol the whole Chang'an,

405
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:09,170
but come here. Aren't you interfering with other's affairs?

406
00:19:13,050 --> 00:19:14,250
So what?

407
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:15,780
For every liang of tea you sell, you can earn 3 ingots of silver.

408
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:17,260
You've been selling it for more than half a year.

409
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:18,390
How much tea have you sold?

410
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:19,960
Have you ever paid tax to the court?

411
00:19:21,470 --> 00:19:22,800
Profits in the Ghost Market

412
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:24,620
are excluded from the tax.

413
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:26,210
This is the rule of Chang'an.

414
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:27,230
Besides,

415
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:28,760
confiscating my property cannot prove your capability.

416
00:19:28,810 --> 00:19:29,620
My tea

417
00:19:29,810 --> 00:19:31,770
is bought with gold and silver.

418
00:19:32,170 --> 00:19:33,000
If you are really capable,

419
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:35,160
go to Lady Shiyi's.

420
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:09,800
I saw them entering this alley.

421
00:20:10,370 --> 00:20:11,290
Why were they gone?

422
00:20:12,490 --> 00:20:13,900
They shot arrows

423
00:20:14,510 --> 00:20:15,950
not as bandits,

424
00:20:16,570 --> 00:20:17,960
but as well-trained soldiers.

425
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:20,190
We need to be more careful.

426
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:22,360
Whom did the tea dealer

427
00:20:22,510 --> 00:20:23,710
ask us to investigate?

428
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:28,270
It seems to be Gentleman Shiyi.

429
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:30,490
No.

430
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:34,230
It's Lady Shiyi.

431
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:43,700
Let's go.

432
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:44,780
Hurry up.

433
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:45,730
It'll be too late if we don't move now.

434
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:46,220
Hurry up.

435
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,400
Don't leave in a hurry.

436
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:50,270
Today is my birthday.

437
00:20:50,890 --> 00:20:52,440
Everyone here is my guest.

438
00:20:52,970 --> 00:20:54,370
I'll treat you to tea.

439
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:56,260
Chang'an black tea.

440
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:57,710
It is delicious.

441
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:01,430
You may enjoy it as much as you want.

442
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:02,630
Master,

443
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:04,040
let's go now.

444
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:05,180
If we are caught by the Imperial Guards...

445
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:05,990
You are ignorant.

446
00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:07,820
One sip of black tea

447
00:21:08,050 --> 00:21:09,420
is better than immortals,

448
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:12,100
let alone unlimited drinking.

449
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:13,890
Get out!

450
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:24,460
Sir,

451
00:22:24,810 --> 00:22:27,090
I sell fancy spices here.

452
00:22:27,530 --> 00:22:28,310
As long as women smell one of them,

453
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,510
they won't leave you.

454
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:32,530
Is that true?

455
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:33,940
Sheriff.

456
00:22:42,310 --> 00:22:43,800
We've seen that man before.

457
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:44,980
He almost got his hands chopped off

458
00:22:45,070 --> 00:22:46,310
when he tried to steal chicken that day.

459
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:47,500
It's not his first offense.

460
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:06,280
Where is my chicken?

461
00:23:09,610 --> 00:23:10,980
You chicken thief!

462
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:15,830
Whom do you call a chicken thief?

463
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:20,030
You look familiar to me.

464
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:25,440
Ghost!

465
00:23:27,450 --> 00:23:28,410
What's wrong with him?

466
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:31,840
Maybe he smelled

467
00:23:31,870 --> 00:23:33,000
the scent of this.

468
00:23:47,810 --> 00:23:48,650
There's actually such a big store

469
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:50,740
in the Ghost Market.

470
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:53,560
Endearing and alluring is Lady Shiyi.

471
00:23:51,350 --> 00:23:53,420
[Endearing and Alluring is Lady Shiyi.]

472
00:23:54,010 --> 00:23:55,060
It's only been a few days,

473
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:56,750
but the banner has been changed.

474
00:23:57,490 --> 00:23:58,670
We've caused quite a stir

475
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:00,900
but they're dancing like nothing happened.

476
00:24:01,030 --> 00:24:01,540
They're prepared?

477
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:04,740
Wu died here.

478
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:06,090
We must be careful.

479
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:07,000
Jia,

480
00:24:07,490 --> 00:24:08,180
it feels way too good

481
00:24:08,210 --> 00:24:09,360
to work

482
00:24:09,390 --> 00:24:10,340
with the Imperial Guards.

483
00:24:10,630 --> 00:24:11,190
You bet.

484
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:12,030
Yeah.

485
00:24:12,290 --> 00:24:13,900
I haven't felt so fantastic for years.

486
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:17,160
Luo, Liu,

487
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:19,510
we must seize the chance

488
00:24:20,090 --> 00:24:21,030
to make our names known.

489
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:24,460
General,

490
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:26,160
let us lead the assault.

491
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:28,560
Gentlemen,

492
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:30,770
let's show those scum what we county guards

493
00:24:31,210 --> 00:24:32,440
are capable of!

494
00:24:32,810 --> 00:24:33,380
Yeah!

495
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:33,780
Let's go.

496
00:24:34,330 --> 00:24:34,880
General.

497
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:39,900
Let them go.

498
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:41,560
If there's a trap, we'll know.

499
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:57,420
This is so humiliating.

500
00:24:58,730 --> 00:25:00,050
This place is to be searched.

501
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:01,210
Where is the store owner?

502
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:03,660
Well...

503
00:25:08,850 --> 00:25:09,870
We have guests.

504
00:25:10,650 --> 00:25:11,420
Serve them the tea.

505
00:25:12,190 --> 00:25:12,880
Yes.

506
00:25:27,010 --> 00:25:27,960
Please.

507
00:25:28,770 --> 00:25:29,550
What's this?

508
00:25:30,210 --> 00:25:32,410
The best tea ever, Chang'an black tea.

509
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:32,970
How dare you!

510
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:35,040
We are here to confiscate this tea.

511
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,910
Poor guards like you

512
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:49,490
should cherish the opportunity

513
00:25:49,530 --> 00:25:51,270
to have a sip of Chang'an black tea.

514
00:25:51,770 --> 00:25:53,170
You're being fools to refuse it.

515
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:55,560
Are you off your heads already?

516
00:25:55,870 --> 00:25:57,100
You are Lady Shiyi?

517
00:25:59,830 --> 00:26:01,360
Yeah. So what?

518
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:03,860
Endearing and alluring indeed.

519
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,100
Shut up!

520
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:07,830
You diabolic bitch.

521
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:09,180
Surrender now and I'll be easy on you.

522
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:10,340
So bold of you to say that.

523
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:12,100
Don't scare my guests.

524
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:14,980
Go. Go. Go.

525
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:18,020
You're not afraid of us at all, are you?

526
00:26:18,050 --> 00:26:19,110
No one is allowed to leave.

527
00:26:19,770 --> 00:26:20,600
Whether they stay or leave

528
00:26:21,170 --> 00:26:22,680
is not up to you.

529
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:23,960
Take her down!

530
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:07,190
The Imperial Guards are here.

531
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:08,540
All county guards

532
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:09,400
retreat!

533
00:27:16,210 --> 00:27:17,050
Are you sure, General?

534
00:27:17,650 --> 00:27:19,730
Maybe we should fight them together.

535
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:20,470
A bunch of losers!

536
00:27:21,210 --> 00:27:22,020
Get out!

537
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:23,230
Do what General Lu said.

538
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:25,010
Yes, do what General Lu said.

539
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:25,980
Retreat.

540
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:40,580
You're afraid of being held accountable

541
00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:41,680
if those county guards die here,

542
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:44,010
right?

543
00:27:45,660 --> 00:27:46,320
Fang Xiang God?

544
00:27:47,370 --> 00:27:48,480
Meet you with respect, Immortal Venerable.

545
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:50,470
You practiced sorcery

546
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:51,530
to kill people,

547
00:27:51,770 --> 00:27:52,690
and sell the black tea.

548
00:27:53,060 --> 00:27:53,900
You're the cancer of our society.

549
00:27:54,250 --> 00:27:55,010
As a General,

550
00:27:55,190 --> 00:27:56,190
I'll end your life myself.

551
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:57,060
You old prick!

552
00:27:57,570 --> 00:27:59,770
Look around, boy.

553
00:28:00,170 --> 00:28:02,140
You can't threaten me at my place.

554
00:28:03,230 --> 00:28:04,550
The Lu family from Fanyang

555
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:07,030
is indeed very proud.

556
00:28:08,430 --> 00:28:09,210
You know me?

557
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:11,380
Who are you?

558
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:12,560
Take a guess.

559
00:28:12,950 --> 00:28:14,340
But it wouldn’t help even if you guessed right,

560
00:28:14,770 --> 00:28:16,240
because you won't be able to

561
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:17,520
leave here alive.

562
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:20,090
These two warriors

563
00:28:20,110 --> 00:28:22,360
can't be hurt by any weapons.

564
00:28:23,050 --> 00:28:24,450
You're doomed to die!

565
00:28:26,050 --> 00:28:26,970
This place is weird.

566
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:27,990
There might be an ambush.

567
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:29,200
Leave, General.

568
00:28:29,570 --> 00:28:30,320
I'll take care of it here.

569
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:32,980
Imperial Guards!

570
00:28:33,090 --> 00:28:33,660
Yes!

571
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:35,700
Kill these beasts with me.

572
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:37,140
Behead whoever dares

573
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:38,110
to resist.

574
00:28:38,370 --> 00:28:38,940
Yes!

575
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:18,090
Stop!

576
00:29:20,070 --> 00:29:20,670
Stop!

577
00:29:25,550 --> 00:29:26,310
Stop there!

578
00:30:04,430 --> 00:30:05,960
Can't you just let me go?

579
00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:06,860
Wait.

580
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:08,180
Sir, listen to me.

581
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:11,370
I'm not a ghost.

582
00:30:11,630 --> 00:30:13,270
I'm here to make friends with you.

583
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:15,100
I'll be damned if I believe you.

584
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:36,530
The weakness of them

585
00:30:37,130 --> 00:30:38,490
is their eyes?

586
00:31:22,370 --> 00:31:23,440
Leave, General!

587
00:31:32,810 --> 00:31:33,690
Leave?

588
00:31:34,250 --> 00:31:35,650
It's too late.

589
00:31:36,070 --> 00:31:36,670
General.

590
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:38,290
Don't worry.

591
00:31:38,750 --> 00:31:39,300
Go!

592
00:31:40,090 --> 00:31:40,890
Report this to His Highness.

593
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:42,260
I'll wipe out the Ghost Market.

594
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:44,180
All these heretics

595
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:45,600
who did harm to the country

596
00:31:45,790 --> 00:31:46,710
will be brought to justice.

597
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:48,660
Go!

598
00:31:51,970 --> 00:31:52,410
Bring it on.

599
00:31:53,150 --> 00:31:54,240
I'm right here.

600
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:55,540
Fight with me if you dare.

601
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:57,300
You're already my prisoner.

602
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:58,690
So stop bluffing.

603
00:31:59,150 --> 00:32:00,000
Lady Shiyi,

604
00:32:00,470 --> 00:32:02,160
count for me.

605
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:04,200
I wanna know how many arrows

606
00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:06,280
it will take to kill the General.

607
00:32:12,690 --> 00:32:14,720
Stop. Stop running.

608
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:17,970
You damn ghost!

609
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:19,950
Stop chasing me!

610
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:42,670
General.

611
00:32:44,970 --> 00:32:45,570
General,

612
00:32:45,610 --> 00:32:47,190
come down the tunnel with me!

613
00:32:47,690 --> 00:32:48,360
Shoot!

614
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,260
Don't let them escape!

615
00:32:52,450 --> 00:32:52,920
Hurry!

616
00:32:57,570 --> 00:32:58,650
Go after them!

617
00:33:08,270 --> 00:33:09,590
Lu Lingfeng,

618
00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:10,700
are you okay?

619
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:12,290
What are you doing here?

620
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:13,740
You can't even defend yourself.

621
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:14,340
I...

622
00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:15,840
It's not safe here.

623
00:33:16,210 --> 00:33:17,680
Follow me.

624
00:33:24,250 --> 00:33:24,810
Let's go.

625
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:54,320
Come in.

626
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:00,830
All right.

627
00:34:01,490 --> 00:34:02,570
Now we don't

628
00:34:02,590 --> 00:34:03,480
have to whisper.

629
00:34:03,740 --> 00:34:04,650
No one can hear us here.

630
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:08,500
No. No.

631
00:34:11,420 --> 00:34:12,449
The wounded one can stay.

632
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,840
You, leave.

633
00:34:17,540 --> 00:34:18,489
He's a defenseless nerd.

634
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:20,440
He'll die once he goes out.

635
00:34:22,350 --> 00:34:23,389
But he scares me

636
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:24,360
if he stays.

637
00:34:24,570 --> 00:34:26,179
Can't you see I'm trembling?

638
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:27,600
He must leave.

639
00:34:27,810 --> 00:34:28,690
What are you afraid of?

640
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:32,080
Not you.

641
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:33,620
You got shot

642
00:34:33,699 --> 00:34:34,699
in order to

643
00:34:34,699 --> 00:34:35,409
save me.

644
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:37,080
So it's unlikely that you'll kill me.

645
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:38,320
Just…

646
00:34:39,489 --> 00:34:40,500
Drop your sword.

647
00:34:44,530 --> 00:34:46,030
He's different.

648
00:34:46,489 --> 00:34:47,060
He...

649
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:50,179
He's not a human.

650
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:51,620
He's a ghost.

651
00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:54,860
Is it because of the smell on me?

652
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:55,710
See?

653
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:56,880
He admitted it.

654
00:34:57,010 --> 00:34:58,210
There is no ghost in the world.

655
00:34:58,510 --> 00:34:59,320
Stop talking nonsense.

656
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:02,700
I once thought that too,

657
00:35:02,950 --> 00:35:03,860
but he smelled

658
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:05,020
the Soul Returning Incense all over his body.

659
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:06,620
He has to be a ghost.

660
00:35:14,490 --> 00:35:16,410
Do you mean this smell?

661
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:19,260
Is that the cloth

662
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:20,380
wrapped around the brides' bodies?

663
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:23,350
Yes.

664
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,310
Their bodies didn't decay for days.

665
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:28,230
I've been investigating this incense.

666
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:29,590
That's why

667
00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:30,540
I ran into you

668
00:35:30,540 --> 00:35:32,170
in the Ghost Market.

669
00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:38,740
I'm Su Wuming, the sheriff of Chang'an.

670
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:41,670
May I know your name?

671
00:35:42,860 --> 00:35:43,620
You are

672
00:35:44,250 --> 00:35:44,880
the sheriff?

673
00:35:45,530 --> 00:35:46,080
Yes.

674
00:35:52,620 --> 00:35:53,700
My surname is Fed.

675
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:55,100
No first name.

676
00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:57,290
I love eating chicken.

677
00:35:57,700 --> 00:35:59,620
So people in the Ghost Market

678
00:35:59,770 --> 00:36:01,440
call me Chicken Fed.

679
00:36:02,070 --> 00:36:03,350
If you don't find that name funny,

680
00:36:04,250 --> 00:36:05,180
just call me that.

681
00:36:08,060 --> 00:36:09,820
I have a question for you, Mr. Fed.

682
00:36:10,790 --> 00:36:13,250
Do you know the origin of the Soul Returning Incense?

683
00:36:15,570 --> 00:36:16,040
My bad.

684
00:36:16,550 --> 00:36:17,390
You were shot

685
00:36:17,740 --> 00:36:18,730
because of me.

686
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:20,580
Let me pull that arrow out for you.

687
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:27,160
Come.

688
00:36:30,890 --> 00:36:32,390
I know you don't trust me.

689
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:34,120
But they are looking for you outside.

690
00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:35,180
You have to stay here

691
00:36:35,180 --> 00:36:36,000
for the time being.

692
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:40,270
Mr. Fed is well-versed in medicine.

693
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:41,290
General,

694
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:42,910
give him some credit.

695
00:36:48,910 --> 00:36:49,980
One arrow

696
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:51,580
won't necessarily kill you.

697
00:36:52,060 --> 00:36:52,930
I'm just worried

698
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:55,330
that the arrow might be poisonous.

699
00:36:55,750 --> 00:36:56,920
Those wicked people

700
00:36:56,940 --> 00:36:58,240
can do anything.

701
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:02,960
General,

702
00:37:02,990 --> 00:37:04,990
don't take his every word seriously.

703
00:37:05,030 --> 00:37:06,900
After all, Mr. Fed is known

704
00:37:06,930 --> 00:37:08,160
for sneaking around and stealing chicken

705
00:37:08,190 --> 00:37:09,760
in the Ghost Market.

706
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:11,490
How can we believe someone like that?

707
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:14,880
You just asked me

708
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:16,150
the origin of the Soul Returning Incense.

709
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:17,900
How can you look down on me now?

710
00:37:18,380 --> 00:37:20,330
Does it matter

711
00:37:20,350 --> 00:37:21,230
whether I look down on you or not?

712
00:37:21,290 --> 00:37:22,420
I doubt that someone like you

713
00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:23,410
really know the origin of the incense.

714
00:37:23,780 --> 00:37:24,780
Of course I know!

715
00:37:25,030 --> 00:37:26,440
I can tell you now.

716
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:27,990
In the backyard of the government office of the West Market,

717
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:29,320
there are bizarre herbs growing there.

718
00:37:29,350 --> 00:37:30,590
Go ask Kang Yuanli,

719
00:37:30,620 --> 00:37:31,460
the government official of the West Market,

720
00:37:31,460 --> 00:37:32,700
about what they're used for.

721
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:34,900
You think

722
00:37:34,930 --> 00:37:36,460
knowing an official's name

723
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:38,320
can make you trustworthy in the General's eyes?

724
00:37:42,170 --> 00:37:43,690
There are indeed

725
00:37:43,930 --> 00:37:45,660
bizarre herbs in that backyard.

726
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:47,630
Su Wuming,

727
00:37:47,980 --> 00:37:49,430
stop daring me.

728
00:37:49,860 --> 00:37:51,330
I'm not a three-year-old.

729
00:37:52,790 --> 00:37:53,490
Chicken Fed.

730
00:37:53,930 --> 00:37:54,890
I trust you.

731
00:37:57,410 --> 00:37:58,740
Take this arrow out for me.

732
00:38:04,810 --> 00:38:05,980
It's really poison-tipped.

733
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:07,830
Damn it.

734
00:38:08,690 --> 00:38:09,410
Pulling the arrow out

735
00:38:09,430 --> 00:38:10,880
is just the start.

736
00:38:13,330 --> 00:38:13,900
Well...

737
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:15,940
Let's have a talk.

738
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:17,540
About what?

739
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:18,850
Listen,

740
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:21,320
you got shot because of me,

741
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:22,980
but you can't blame it on me.

742
00:38:23,060 --> 00:38:23,660
Right?

743
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:26,290
But you'll thank me

744
00:38:26,330 --> 00:38:27,340
for saving your life.

745
00:38:29,420 --> 00:38:31,190
So you must repay me.

746
00:38:32,430 --> 00:38:33,390
How?

747
00:38:33,620 --> 00:38:35,100
I-I'm a foodie.

748
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:36,630
I love eating chicken.

749
00:38:37,030 --> 00:38:38,670
Could you promise me

750
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:40,020
one chicken every day?

751
00:38:40,370 --> 00:38:41,490
Served with booze is preferred.

752
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:42,740
I can promise you that.

753
00:38:43,350 --> 00:38:44,120
Leave us alone.

754
00:38:44,390 --> 00:38:45,380
You look mean

755
00:38:45,620 --> 00:38:46,620
and cunning.

756
00:38:46,820 --> 00:38:47,480
You don't trust you.

757
00:38:48,510 --> 00:38:49,230
General,

758
00:38:49,490 --> 00:38:50,770
you're good-looking

759
00:38:50,930 --> 00:38:52,130
and righteous.

760
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:54,090
I know you'll keep your word.

761
00:38:54,940 --> 00:38:55,530
Okay.

762
00:38:56,710 --> 00:38:57,660
One chicken every day.

763
00:38:58,860 --> 00:38:59,540
Whether there will be booze will

764
00:38:59,580 --> 00:39:00,810
depend on my mood.

765
00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:03,460
Do it.

766
00:39:05,340 --> 00:39:05,900
Deal.

767
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:07,310
You have a temper.

768
00:39:07,340 --> 00:39:08,140
I like you.

769
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:16,110
We've searched every corner of the Ghost Market,

770
00:39:16,530 --> 00:39:17,310
but we couldn't find

771
00:39:17,340 --> 00:39:18,830
Lu Lingfeng and Su Wuming.

772
00:39:19,340 --> 00:39:20,260
Once it dawns,

773
00:39:21,090 --> 00:39:22,470
there's nothing we can do.

774
00:39:23,340 --> 00:39:24,030
Don't worry.

775
00:39:24,430 --> 00:39:25,600
When it dawns,

776
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:28,240
the poison will take Lu Lingfeng's life for us.

777
00:39:28,620 --> 00:39:29,600
He won't

778
00:39:29,630 --> 00:39:31,210
be in our way anymore.

779
00:39:31,460 --> 00:39:32,460
But he confiscated

780
00:39:32,490 --> 00:39:33,370
all our stock of the tea.

781
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:34,720
There's still half a month left.

782
00:39:35,330 --> 00:39:36,670
Those addicted officials and nobles

783
00:39:36,970 --> 00:39:37,680
can't wait.

784
00:39:38,530 --> 00:39:39,980
Then tell them

785
00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:42,340
that on the 18th of this month,

786
00:39:43,210 --> 00:39:44,890
a batch of first-class tea

787
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:46,460
will be put on the market in advance.

788
00:39:46,930 --> 00:39:48,700
They can only pre-order it by gold.

789
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:50,920
As for the price,

790
00:39:51,970 --> 00:39:53,820
you can increase it enormously this time.

791
00:39:55,690 --> 00:39:56,860
Is all this

792
00:39:57,730 --> 00:39:59,900
a part of your plan?

793
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:32,100
Sheriff Su,

794
00:40:32,540 --> 00:40:34,440
you're really considerate.

795
00:40:36,830 --> 00:40:37,660
He has to wake up now,

796
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:39,130
or it'll be too late

797
00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:41,130
for you to leave

798
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:42,690
the Ghost Market.

799
00:40:44,210 --> 00:40:44,810
General,

800
00:40:45,130 --> 00:40:45,660
wake up!

801
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:46,790
Move!

802
00:40:58,690 --> 00:40:59,550
Careful!

803
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:01,690
I had to gouge out a large chunk of fresh.

804
00:41:11,860 --> 00:41:12,930
Watch out, General.

805
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:15,900
Lu Lingfeng, the General of the Imperial Guards,

806
00:41:16,610 --> 00:41:18,400
thank you for saving my life. You're a great doctor.

807
00:41:19,810 --> 00:41:20,730
A great doctor?

808
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:22,220
That's not me.

809
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:25,920
He was so badly injured

810
00:41:25,970 --> 00:41:28,540
but you helped him bounce back overnight.

811
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:31,060
Of course you're a great doctor.

812
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:32,100
That's what you are.

813
00:41:32,380 --> 00:41:34,040
I hate being called that.

814
00:41:44,650 --> 00:41:45,620
Sheriff Su.

815
00:41:46,930 --> 00:41:47,710
Magistrate Yuan.

816
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:50,670
Sheriff Su.

817
00:41:55,860 --> 00:41:56,580
Magistrate Yuan.

818
00:41:58,470 --> 00:41:59,550
I heard that you

819
00:41:59,850 --> 00:42:02,080
went to the Ghost Market last night to crack the murder case.

820
00:42:02,630 --> 00:42:04,850
I've been worried sick.

821
00:42:05,170 --> 00:42:06,480
What do you mean by that?

822
00:42:19,770 --> 00:42:23,880
♫The storm rises with no reason♫
