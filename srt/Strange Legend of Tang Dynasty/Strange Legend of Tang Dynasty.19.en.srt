the stone with the word "loser" instead.

Then I fainted.

My lady was killed by him.

119
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:13,940
Some people said

120

they had seen this white-haired ghost before.

We really can't catch this ghost.

123
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:22,350
The promise of seven days you said,

124
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:24,220
that's too hasty.

125
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:26,020
What?

126
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:27,550
Seven days?

127
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:29,620
That's right.

128
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,150
If he can't catch the ghost, he'll eat a stone.

129
00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:33,610
Eat a stone?

130
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:35,530
So boring!

131
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:37,970
Why doesn't he resign and go back to Nanzhou?

132
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:41,790
If he eats a stone in public,

133
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,290
will he stay in Ju County

134
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:45,690
without resigning?

135
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,680
You're right.

136
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:53,659
Is this

137
00:07:54,290 --> 00:07:56,090
a good thing or a bad thing?

138
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:57,760
Of course it is a good thing.

139
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:00,210
If he can solve the case in seven days,

140
00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:02,280
he is just a worker,

141
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:05,620
of course the contribution belongs to you.

142
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,530
If he can't solve the case in seven days,

143
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:08,840
he will leave.

144
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:10,510
If a new sheriff comes,

145
00:08:12,530 --> 00:08:14,980
he must obey the rules

146
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:17,140
and be at your disposal.

147
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:20,780
It means

148
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:23,160
we won't lose anything.

149
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:24,380
Yes.

150
00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:26,240
Okay.

151
00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:29,750
Follow me to the Western Office

152
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:33,960
confirm the seven-day agreement with him.

153
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:44,990
Are you afraid?

154
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:47,910
Then go back to Nanzhou.

155
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:49,980
No, Master.

156
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:51,240

that maid said

158
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:55,280
was the one I saw

159
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:57,060
in the yard of the Hall of Life last night.

160
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:58,600
You had a long journey yesterday.

161
00:08:58,620 --> 00:08:59,590
You were in a trance

162
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:00,780
and had hallucinations.

163
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:02,610
It was not a hallucination.

164
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:04,370
I really saw it.

165
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:04,860
Shut up!

166
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:07,870
If you say that again,

167
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:09,250
you'll be beaten.

168
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:15,220
I heard that Sheriff Lu promised the people

169
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:16,260
to close the case in seven days.

170
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:18,850
Don't take it too seriously.

171
00:09:19,630 --> 00:09:22,010
At most, you'll just break your promise and lose the people's trust.

172
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:25,140
Of course not.

173
00:09:26,770 --> 00:09:27,550
No?

174
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:30,940
Never!

175
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,140
It is not easy to handle.

176
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,390

in seven days,

178
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:44,260
I can only report to a higher body truthfully.

179
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:44,940
No need.

180
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:46,900
I will resign.

181
00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:48,900
Don't bother.

182
00:09:50,210 --> 00:09:51,020
OK

183
00:09:51,710 --> 00:09:53,420
Then I will prepare

184
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:54,580
a feast.

185
00:09:54,890 --> 00:09:56,570
We'll celebrate if you solve the case.

186
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:58,430
If the case is still unsolved,

187
00:10:00,650 --> 00:10:02,260
take it as a farewell.

188
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:04,480
Brother Lu.

189
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:05,340
Seven days.

190
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:07,060
See you in seven days.

191
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:10,900
Master.

192
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,610
If it's really a ghost,

193
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:14,390
where can we catch him?

194
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:18,820
There's no need for seven days.

195
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:20,570
I've already caught him.

196
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:24,810
What?

197
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:26,920
He has caught the ghost?

198
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:28,460
No way.

199
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:30,760
We just came back from the Western Office.

200
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:32,320
Is Lu Lingfeng a god?

201
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,440
You're right.

202
00:10:34,210 --> 00:10:36,080
The government office has posted a notice.

203
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,940
But we haven't seen the murderer yet.

204
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:39,050
This...

205
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:42,080
[Notice]

206
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:41,220
No way.

207
00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:42,510
The murderer who killed twelve people

208
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:43,310
has been caught.

209
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:44,220
Why not?

210
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:45,340
It's written

211
00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:46,650
clearly.

212
00:10:46,930 --> 00:10:48,540
The new sheriff is capable.

213
00:10:49,010 --> 00:10:49,900
Twelve lives.

214
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:50,710
Can they really catch a ghost?

215
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:51,650
At three in the afternoon afternoon,

216
00:10:51,730 --> 00:10:53,030
the murderer will be paraded in front of the crowd.

217
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:54,100
There are two hours left.

218
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:55,300
I want to see

219
00:10:55,330 --> 00:10:56,860
what that murderer looks like.

220
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:57,720
Yes.

221
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:00,270
Let's see what does he look like.

222
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:01,830
The murderer has been arrested

223
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:03,500
and will be paraded in front of the crowd!

224
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:04,660
Finally he is caught.

225
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:09,510
The murderer has been arrested and will be paraded in front of the crowd!

226
00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:11,360
We must eat him alive.

227
00:11:12,010 --> 00:11:13,210
He's a real jerk.

228
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:15,790
The murderer has been arrested and will be paraded in front of the crowd!

229
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:18,620
Beat him up! Beat him up!

230
00:11:18,890 --> 00:11:20,140
Murderers

231
00:11:20,390 --> 00:11:21,830
will be punished by the law.

232
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:23,590
No lynching.

233
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:26,600
Go away!

234
00:11:27,050 --> 00:11:27,870
Don't stop me.

235
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:29,460
I'll swallow him alive!

236
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:30,330
Calm down!

237
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:32,260
Kill this beast!

238
00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:33,670
Kill him!

239
00:11:34,090 --> 00:11:36,490
Kill him!

240
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:38,010
Bastard!

241
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:38,980
Beat him!

242
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:41,630
Kill him! Kill him!

243
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:42,980
Beat him!

244
00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:44,130
Beat him!

245
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:44,820
Bastard!

246
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:48,060
How did he come out?

247
00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:49,260
Sword!

248
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:00,140
What are you doing?

249
00:12:03,450 --> 00:12:04,420
My vegetables.

250
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:06,430
What's going on?

251
00:12:09,050 --> 00:12:09,910
Watch out!

252
00:12:14,370 --> 00:12:15,410
What are they doing?

253
00:12:19,850 --> 00:12:20,620
Watch out!

254
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,650
Be careful. You scared me.

255
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:29,580
What are they doing?

256
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,010
Get away! Hurry!

257
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:54,340
Xue Huan.

258
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:55,060
Save him!

259
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:55,580
Yes.

260
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:08,060
He disappeared here.

261
00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:09,510
He can't escape from Ju County.

262
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,300
We have people guarding the city gate

263
00:13:11,650 --> 00:13:12,490
according to your order.

264
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:13,210
Master.

265
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:15,220
I've asked someone

266
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:16,340
to send the victim to see the doctor.

267
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:16,980
Okay.

268
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:18,320
Officer.

269
00:13:18,570 --> 00:13:19,050
Xue Huan.

270
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:19,930
Each of you take four men.

271
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:20,900
We'll split into three groups

272
00:13:21,410 --> 00:13:22,290
to search door to door.

273
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:23,610
-Yes, sir. -Yes.

274
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:24,330
Xue Huan.

275
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:26,190
When I fought with that man just now,

276
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:27,380
he is a human, not a ghost.

277
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:30,690
This is the time for my disciple to make contributions.

278
00:13:31,330 --> 00:13:32,050
Don't worry, Master.

279
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:40,850
Did anyone enter your house?

280
00:13:41,310 --> 00:13:42,130
No one came in.

281
00:13:42,730 --> 00:13:43,420
Lock the door.

282
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:01,710
Muderer!

283
00:14:02,170 --> 00:14:03,410
Stop escaping!

284
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:20,040
Master.

285
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:21,210
I'm incompetent.

286
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:22,600
That murderer has ran away.

287
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:23,940
I heard about it.

288
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:25,780
If the sword has a blade,

289
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:27,220
he won't be able to escape.

290
00:14:28,290 --> 00:14:28,790
Get up.

291
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:33,700
Master.

292
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:36,420
Please allow me to sharpen the blade.

293
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:45,820
No way.

294
00:14:46,910 --> 00:14:48,700
You're still young and not mature enough.

295
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:49,900
Once the blade is sharpened,

296
00:14:50,210 --> 00:14:52,410
you will be infected by the aura of death.

297
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:53,720
That's bad.

298
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:54,700
Get up.

299
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:55,720
Master.

300
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:57,220
Alright.

301
00:14:58,580 --> 00:14:59,820
You are very brave today.

302
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:01,230
I'm glad.

303
00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:05,290
The oranges are fresh.

304
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:06,090
Sheriff Lu.

305
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:06,780
Hi.

306
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:11,340
Sheriff Lu.

307
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:12,700
Hello.

308
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:14,100
Have a look and buy some.

309
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:20,980
Master.

310
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:23,020
Although we've failed to catch the murderer today,

311
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,400
the people in Ju County

312
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,100
seemed to think differently about you.

313
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:30,500
Actually, since I came to Nanzhou,

314
00:15:31,290 --> 00:15:32,860
especially when I came to Ju County this time,

315
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,680
I found that the world

316
00:15:35,210 --> 00:15:36,810
was different from what I thought.

317
00:15:37,810 --> 00:15:38,760
I used to think

318
00:15:39,210 --> 00:15:41,540
the country was in peace,

319
00:15:42,210 --> 00:15:43,310
and the people lived in prosperity.

320
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:45,060
Actually,

321
00:15:45,810 --> 00:15:47,740
I didn't know the suffering of the people at all.

322
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:49,530
I said

323
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:51,220
I cared about the country.

324
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:52,780
What a joke.

325
00:15:56,310 --> 00:15:57,610
Take Ju County as an example.

326
00:15:58,450 --> 00:15:59,400
The miasma is severe.

327
00:15:59,690 --> 00:16:00,510
The head disease is spreading.

328
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:01,620
People's lives are declining.

329
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:03,630
Nine out of ten people are poor.

330
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:05,370
The people live a hard life.

331
00:16:06,330 --> 00:16:07,240
Although sheriff isn't a high-ranking official,

332
00:16:07,690 --> 00:16:08,700
it has important responsibilities.

333
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:10,500
We should really

334
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:11,820
do more for the people.

335
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:13,870
It's my luck

336
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:15,690
to have a master like you.

337
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:20,230
[Ju County]

338
00:16:22,010 --> 00:16:22,780
Take a look.

339
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:24,740
Go in.

340
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:25,220
Okay.

341
00:16:26,850 --> 00:16:27,530
What's in your bag?

342
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:32,740
Sheriff Lu.

343
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:33,940
Let him go.

344
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:38,340
[Wanted]

345
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:41,390
Okay, next.

346
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:43,750
Master, are you thinking

347
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:45,140
that if my lady was here,

348
00:16:45,650 --> 00:16:46,740
the portrait would've been much better?

349
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:47,880
Yes.

350
00:16:49,090 --> 00:16:50,560
I'll send a letter

351
00:16:50,970 --> 00:16:51,960
and ask her to come to Ju County to help you.

352
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:52,580
Don't be so nosy.

353
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:53,580
Sheriff.

354
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:56,000
Although this portrait does not look alike as the murderer,

355
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:58,020
there are at least eight or nine brothers

356
00:16:58,270 --> 00:16:59,480
who have seen him.

357
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:01,340
He won't be able to escape from Ju County even if he can fly.

358
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,140
Thank you, brothers.

359
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:03,880
Search the whole city again

360
00:17:04,099 --> 00:17:05,300
after dark.

361
00:17:06,339 --> 00:17:07,849
Don't be afraid to alert him.

362
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:08,579
Yes, sheriff.

363
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:10,590
Sheriff Lu.

364
00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:12,060
Why are you here?

365
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:13,130
Zhai Liang.

366
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:14,490
Why are you here?

367
00:18:16,290 --> 00:18:18,760
There are many people with headache recently.

368
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:19,820
I just finished my work.

369
00:18:20,330 --> 00:18:21,290
I went to the medicine warehouse

370
00:18:21,410 --> 00:18:22,450
to check the herbs.

371
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:23,880
Check the herbs?

372
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:27,820
Without your staff

373
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:29,340
or a lantern?

374
00:18:29,770 --> 00:18:31,160
M-My staff left earlier.

375
00:18:31,450 --> 00:18:32,890
I held the light in the medicine warehouse,

376
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:34,130
and I put it off when I left.

377
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:35,760
The moon is bright tonight,

378
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:37,020
so the lantern isn't needed.

379
00:18:44,370 --> 00:18:45,300
Did I disturb you?

380
00:18:46,330 --> 00:18:47,330
Your backyard is not small.

381
00:18:47,650 --> 00:18:48,490
The attic is not small, either.

382
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:50,070
There's no one else living here

383
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:51,340
except for the purpose as a medicine warehouse?

384
00:18:53,170 --> 00:18:54,750
No, never.

385
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:57,820
Your uncle

386
00:18:57,820 --> 00:18:58,660
left you this house,

387
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,550
and you practise medicine here.

388
00:19:01,690 --> 00:19:03,470
Why don't you just live here?

389
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,310
I'm afraid that living here

390
00:19:09,090 --> 00:19:10,290
will make me think of my uncle often.

391
00:19:10,810 --> 00:19:12,460
So I'd rather rent it out

392
00:19:12,790 --> 00:19:14,320
to save the trouble of recollecting my uncle.

393
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:17,750
Sheriff Lu.

394
00:19:18,470 --> 00:19:19,380
If there's nothing else,

395
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:21,450
I'll take my leave.

396
00:19:22,530 --> 00:19:23,090
Go ahead.

397
00:19:25,490 --> 00:19:26,690
This house has been vacant for a long time.

398
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:28,010
Many stray cats

399
00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:29,190
live here.

400
00:19:29,630 --> 00:19:30,430
After a long time,

401
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:31,810
they have became more wild.

402
00:19:32,150 --> 00:19:34,100
I hope they won't startle you.

403
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:50,580
What is this?

404
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:52,740
The assistant of county magistrate asked me to send it to you.

405
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:55,270
He said the tax payment needed to be called for recently.

406
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:56,590
Master.

407
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,050
Assisant Ye also said that

408
00:19:58,530 --> 00:19:59,730
the Dragon King Temple was leaking.

409
00:20:00,130 --> 00:20:01,490
He asked you to take someone to repair it.

410
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:03,000
He also said that the levee outside the city

411
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:03,800
needed to be reinforced,

412
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:05,730
and the canal for irrigating the farmland

413
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:06,870
needed to be excavated.

414
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:09,940
The rape and murder case hasn't been finished yet,

415
00:20:10,450 --> 00:20:11,950
and the murderer is still at large,

416
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:13,840
how can I have time for these?

417
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:15,950
That's what I said too.

418
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:17,720
But Assistant Ye said

419
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,870
these are all your work.

420
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:21,880
The assistant of county magistrate also said that

421
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:23,300
the investigation was important,

422
00:20:23,550 --> 00:20:24,660
but the tax collection

423
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:25,740
couldn't be delayed.

424
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:27,230
If you failed,

425
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:28,580
you are not qualified as the sheriff.

426
00:20:28,730 --> 00:20:29,570
If you knew it but didn't do it,

427
00:20:30,610 --> 00:20:31,720
it was a dereliction of duty.

428
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:33,270
Ask him to come and see me.

429
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:34,940
Sheriff Lu.

430
00:20:35,670 --> 00:20:37,310
What a temper!

431
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:39,880
You don't have to call Assistant Ye.

432
00:20:40,190 --> 00:20:41,800
I know very well

433
00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:43,350
that Sheriff Lu is busy investigating the case.

434
00:20:43,810 --> 00:20:44,690
But these

435
00:20:44,930 --> 00:20:47,330
are the duty of the sheriff.

436
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:48,950
If you refuse,

437
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,720
then should I do these?

438
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:53,720
It's inappropriate.

439
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:54,260
You...

440
00:20:58,760 --> 00:20:59,510
It's inappropriate.

441
00:21:00,530 --> 00:21:01,410
I'll do it.

442
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:07,540
Sheriff Lu.

443
00:21:07,930 --> 00:21:08,690
You've offended

444
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:10,340
the magistrate.

445
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:12,820
Why don't you go and apologize to him?

446
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:14,500
What did I do wrong?

447
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:15,740
Then

448
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:17,550
are you really going to do those things?

449
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:18,640
Aren't you going to catch the murderer?

450
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:20,530
Then,

451
00:21:20,790 --> 00:21:22,280
are you going to eat the stone?

452
00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:26,710
With officer here,

453
00:21:27,050 --> 00:21:28,210
and my beloved disciple, Xue Huan,

454
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:29,950
how can we not catch the murderer?

455
00:21:31,230 --> 00:21:31,750
How about this?

456
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:32,540
Here.

457
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:36,510
You're in charge...

458
00:21:39,430 --> 00:21:40,770
[Qingyuan]

459
00:21:49,610 --> 00:21:50,220
Sworn brother.

460
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:54,350
Sworn brother!

461
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:55,300
How is it?

462
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:56,570
Any news?

463
00:21:57,210 --> 00:21:57,880
What news?

464
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:59,360
News from Ju County.

465
00:22:00,630 --> 00:22:02,030
You asked me to inquire

466
00:22:02,050 --> 00:22:03,490
about Lu Lingfeng in Ju County.

467
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:05,090
I got busy and forgot about it.

468
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:06,810
Sworn brother. You...

469
00:22:08,850 --> 00:22:10,790
Sworn brother. Stop teasing me.

470
00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:12,290
Tell me.

471
00:22:12,850 --> 00:22:14,260
Lu Lingfeng has been

472
00:22:14,430 --> 00:22:15,770
even busier than me recently.

473
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:17,620
He needs to repair the levee, excavate the canal,

474
00:22:17,770 --> 00:22:19,640
and collect taxes.

475
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:22,850
Didn't you say a homicide took place

476
00:22:22,910 --> 00:22:24,300
as soon as he took office?

477
00:22:24,730 --> 00:22:25,920
As a sheriff,

478
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:27,180
doesn't he need to investigate the case?

479
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:27,820
Yes.

480
00:22:28,850 --> 00:22:30,740
I don't know about the details.

481
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:33,050
Someone from Ju County said

482
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:35,720
Lu Lingfeng was so anxious that he had a headache.

483
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:37,560
But don't worry.

484
00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:38,880
This headache

485
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:40,900
is very common in Ju County.

486
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:41,860
He should be fine.

487
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:47,460
Take three doses.

488
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:48,220
OK.

489
00:22:50,250 --> 00:22:51,110
Dr. Zhai.

490
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:53,280
Take the medicine for three days

491
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:54,560
and then come to me for acupuncture.

492
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:56,400
-Thank you, Dr. Zhai. -Thank you.

493
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:03,460
Remember.

494
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:04,770
No matter how busy you are,

495
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:07,060
the medical practice log can't be left blank.

496
00:23:08,010 --> 00:23:09,320
The log must clearly record

497
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:11,100
the patients who came here every day,

498
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:12,600
and patients' symptoms

499
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,450
and the prescription.

500
00:23:15,450 --> 00:23:15,840
Yes.

501
00:23:17,710 --> 00:23:18,190
Please.

502
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:19,820
Master,

503
00:23:19,930 --> 00:23:21,160
Sheriff Lu is here.

504
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:22,460
Sheriff Lu.

505
00:23:24,010 --> 00:23:24,940
Dr. Zhai,

506
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:27,550
I'm having a severe headache recently.

507
00:23:28,170 --> 00:23:29,380
Please give me the acupuncture treatment.

508
00:23:30,730 --> 00:23:31,340
Sheriff Lu,

509
00:23:31,630 --> 00:23:33,270
there are still a few people waiting there.

510
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:36,060
Someone is still getting his acupuncture in the acupuncture room too.

511
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:36,840
This...

512
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:38,340
It really hurts.

513
00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:40,480
Why don't you do it for me in my house?

514
00:23:41,030 --> 00:23:42,030
It's inappropriate.

515
00:23:42,530 --> 00:23:44,590
Why don't we go to

516
00:23:44,610 --> 00:23:45,170
the attic in the backyard?

517
00:23:45,610 --> 00:23:46,780
Isn't that your storehouse for you medicine?

518
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:49,260
I may recover faster with the scent of the medicine.

519
00:23:53,710 --> 00:23:54,670
Come with me.

520
00:24:04,790 --> 00:24:05,390
Everyone,

521
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:08,650
this is the new sheriff

522
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:09,530
of our county.

523
00:24:10,470 --> 00:24:11,970
May I excuse myself?

524
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,360
I heard that you had a seven-day promise,

525
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:15,580
it was almost time for the seven days to end.

526
00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:16,700
You may go first.

527
00:24:17,050 --> 00:24:18,470
After your headache is treated, you can catch the murderer.

528
00:24:18,870 --> 00:24:19,630
Yes.

529
00:24:19,850 --> 00:24:21,890
Don't eat the stones.

530
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:27,500
The people of Ju County treat me so well.

531
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:43,310
Dr Zhai,

532
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:45,520
why did you use the acupuncture method on the others,

533
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:46,890
but trying to make a fool of me?

534
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:48,840
Don't you think I will pay you?

535
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:51,870
You're just heaty.

536
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:53,660
It's different from their headache.

537
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:54,840
But

538
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:55,830
if you stay in Ju County

539
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:56,980
for a few years more,

540
00:24:57,140 --> 00:24:57,820
you might be

541
00:24:58,940 --> 00:24:59,940
like them.

542
00:25:01,290 --> 00:25:02,100
On the day I entered the city,

543
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:03,640
I saw someone moving out.

544
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:05,860
He said he was afraid of the headache.

545
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:07,660
Yes.

546
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:09,320
The people of Ju County are having headache

547
00:25:09,690 --> 00:25:10,810
due to the miasma.

548
00:25:11,490 --> 00:25:12,520
It's hard to remove the miasma,

549
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:15,050
so we can only try out with the treatment.

550
00:25:17,130 --> 00:25:17,990
How many people can be cured?

551
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:20,460
Approximately 30 percent.

552
00:25:21,590 --> 00:25:22,410
Another 30 percent of people's lives

553
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:24,660
can be maintained by taking medicine and acupuncture.

554
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:26,950
The remaining

555
00:25:27,910 --> 00:25:28,560
were uncured.

556
00:25:30,710 --> 00:25:32,030
So many people couldn't be cured.

557
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:33,390
If my uncle

558
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:34,530
didn't creat this acupuncture therapy,

559
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:36,290
there would be more people

560
00:25:36,950 --> 00:25:37,880
dying from this headache.

561
00:25:39,330 --> 00:25:40,680
Talking about old Dr. Meng,

562
00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:42,860
he was really a great doctor.

563
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:45,070
When I was young,

564
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:46,100
I broke my leg when I was cutting wood in the mountain.

565
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:48,020
Thanks to him, my leg was well treated.

566
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:49,950
Otherwise, how could I still walk

567
00:25:49,970 --> 00:25:51,140
here with my legs?

568
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:54,020
The Book of Bones written by my uncle

569
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:55,590
was held a copy for every physician

570
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:56,330
in Nanzhou.

571
00:25:56,780 --> 00:25:58,430
I heard that it was famous

572
00:25:58,460 --> 00:25:59,350
in Luo Yang and Chang'an too.

573
00:25:59,990 --> 00:26:00,760
Unfortunately,

574
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:03,180
the book for acupuncture therapy for the headache

575
00:26:03,210 --> 00:26:03,950
had not finished yet.

576
00:26:04,950 --> 00:26:05,930
He had passed away

577
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:08,720
last year.

578
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:11,320
Great.

579
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:13,310
Dr. Zhai,

580
00:26:13,870 --> 00:26:16,030
the attic of backyard you mentioned that day

581
00:26:16,130 --> 00:26:17,250
was where Mr. Meng

582
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:18,730
wrote his books and made his medicine.

583
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:20,170
Can you bring me there

584
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:21,610
to pay respect to him?

585
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:22,780
No way.

586
00:26:23,830 --> 00:26:25,760
Sheriff Lu is busy,

587
00:26:26,850 --> 00:26:28,490
I don't dare to trouble you.

588
00:26:39,170 --> 00:26:39,730
Master,

589
00:26:40,210 --> 00:26:41,410
do you still have a headache?

590
00:26:42,430 --> 00:26:44,500
Dr. Zhai's acupuncture is really good.

591
00:26:44,850 --> 00:26:45,740
I'm not having headache now.

592
00:26:47,250 --> 00:26:48,500
Then go to bed earlier.

593
00:26:48,810 --> 00:26:49,560
I can't sleep.

594
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,130
I want to read

595
00:26:51,150 --> 00:26:51,790
this file again.

596
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:52,660
You may go to sleep first.

597
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:13,160
Wait.

598
00:29:13,990 --> 00:29:15,540
There are apparently two floors here,

599
00:29:16,210 --> 00:29:17,930
but there are no stairs in the storehouse of the medicine.

600
00:29:37,510 --> 00:29:40,560
The theory of the secret door and trap, and secret passage.

601
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:43,380
[Tomb of Meng Donglao]

602
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:49,100
Master.

603
00:31:59,550 --> 00:32:00,130
Master!

604
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:07,730
Is it dawn yet?

605
00:32:08,530 --> 00:32:10,400
Master, what's wrong?

606
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:13,260
I saw a ghost last night,

607
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:14,910
I was terrified.

608
00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:18,580
There's really a ghost here?

609
00:32:18,890 --> 00:32:20,010
Master, did you see it?

610
00:32:23,990 --> 00:32:24,900
I thought about it all night.

611
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:26,720
I finally understand why there were ghosts.

612
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:28,180
That's because people

613
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:30,380
are afraid when they are facing the unknown.

614
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:31,760
Fear,

615
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:33,690
will make you lose your mind.

616
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,050
I'm ashamed.

617
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:37,610
Although I've practised martial arts since young,

618
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:39,580
and once a general of the Imperial Guards.

619
00:32:40,450 --> 00:32:42,970
I'm still getting afraid

620
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:44,470
in a certain situation.

621
00:32:47,250 --> 00:32:48,420
That's what happened last night.

622
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:51,580
What happened?

623
00:32:54,630 --> 00:32:55,410
Seven days have passed.

624
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:57,560
Follow me to catch the ghost.

625
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:09,780
These days,

626
00:33:10,490 --> 00:33:12,360
I've been busy inside and outside the city,

627
00:33:12,830 --> 00:33:14,120
but all of you are busy too.

628
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:16,520
I would like to thank you all.

629
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:18,440
Officer,

630
00:33:18,990 --> 00:33:20,050
is the city gate well guarded?

631
00:33:20,380 --> 00:33:20,940
Yes.

632
00:33:21,610 --> 00:33:22,530
As long as it's an adult man,

633
00:33:22,650 --> 00:33:23,490
they would not get passed.

634
00:33:24,690 --> 00:33:25,760
Those brothers

635
00:33:25,780 --> 00:33:26,380
who fought with bandits

636
00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:27,420
are taking shifts.

637
00:33:27,780 --> 00:33:28,450
Along with the portrait,

638
00:33:28,990 --> 00:33:30,890
I don't think he dares to go near the city gate.

639
00:33:32,090 --> 00:33:32,920
Has the patrolling

640
00:33:33,290 --> 00:33:33,910
in the city stopped?

641
00:33:34,130 --> 00:33:34,490
No.

642
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:35,860
Officer and I

643
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:36,850
each were leading a team

644
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:38,140
to patrol the whole city

645
00:33:38,170 --> 00:33:39,080
for several times,

646
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:40,320
and has never stopped.

647
00:33:42,850 --> 00:33:43,590
In that case,

648
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:47,240
the murderer has been caught in my trap.

649
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:49,060
Where is he?

650
00:33:50,030 --> 00:33:51,230
The backyard of the Hall of Life.

651
00:33:51,970 --> 00:33:52,880
This...

652
00:33:52,950 --> 00:33:53,490
Sheriff Lu,

653
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:55,400
are you taking us

654
00:33:55,420 --> 00:33:56,300
to the Hall of Life to catch ghost?

655
00:33:56,710 --> 00:33:57,240
Sheriff.

656
00:33:57,820 --> 00:33:58,780
We dare to catch human,

657
00:33:59,130 --> 00:33:59,690
but for ghost?

658
00:34:00,210 --> 00:34:01,290
We dare not catch them.

659
00:34:02,550 --> 00:34:04,020
I live in the Hall of Life.

660
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:06,840
If there is really a ferocious ghost,

661
00:34:07,870 --> 00:34:08,820
why are my disciple and I

662
00:34:09,610 --> 00:34:10,409
still alive?

663
00:34:12,139 --> 00:34:12,969
It's almost noon.

664
00:34:13,530 --> 00:34:15,540
That will be the time with the strongest Yangqi

665
00:34:15,570 --> 00:34:16,820
in one day.

666
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:18,820
Under the scorching sun,

667
00:34:19,230 --> 00:34:20,179
ordinary ghosts

668
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:21,920
will be

669
00:34:23,710 --> 00:34:24,600
burnt into ashes.

670
00:34:40,969 --> 00:34:41,590
Xue Huan.

671
00:34:42,570 --> 00:34:43,449
Where is your bureaucracy?

672
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:48,300
The government is catching thieves! Please stay away!

673
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:52,840
The government is catching thieves! Please stand aside!

674
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:58,970
The government is catching thieves! Please stand aside!

675
00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:03,220
The government is catching thieves! Please stand aside!

676
00:35:07,060 --> 00:35:10,140
The government is catching thieves! Please stand aside!

677
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:16,140
The government is catching thieves! Please stand aside!

678
00:35:21,350 --> 00:35:22,230
What are you doing?

679
00:35:26,580 --> 00:35:27,130
Sheriff Lu,

680
00:35:27,580 --> 00:35:28,660
what are you doing?

681
00:35:30,210 --> 00:35:31,490
Arrest Dr. Zhai first.

682
00:35:31,860 --> 00:35:32,790
Don't let him scream to

683
00:35:33,050 --> 00:35:34,490
tip the murderer off.

684
00:35:34,510 --> 00:35:34,920
Yes.

685
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:36,950
You can knock the gong,

686
00:35:37,310 --> 00:35:38,260
but  you don't let me scream.

687
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:40,170
What are you doing?

688
00:35:40,690 --> 00:35:41,200
Let go!

689
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:42,260
Let go of me!

690
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:43,810
You can't go in.

691
00:35:44,010 --> 00:35:45,060
You can't go in!

692
00:35:45,630 --> 00:35:46,770
You can't go in!

693
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:54,170
There's no one here.

694
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:55,640
Calm down.

695
00:35:56,210 --> 00:35:57,880
There's a secret passage in the storehouse.

696
00:35:58,220 --> 00:35:59,330
It's especially convenient for the offender.

697
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:01,720
That is why I arrested Zhai Liang.

698
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:06,670
Did you hear that?

699
00:36:06,870 --> 00:36:08,310
The secret passage is right behind here.

700
00:36:08,740 --> 00:36:09,660
Break through the secret door!

701
00:36:09,970 --> 00:36:10,570
Yes.

702
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:17,660
This...

703
00:36:18,170 --> 00:36:18,820
Sheriff.

704
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:19,740
This...

705
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:21,350
Why is Meng Donglao's grave

706
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:23,180
here?

707
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:25,580
That's why someone used it

708
00:36:26,130 --> 00:36:27,480
to play tricks.

709
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:28,950
Search!

710
00:37:06,930 --> 00:37:07,800
No one is here.

711
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,020
The offender is outside the window!

712
00:37:13,590 --> 00:37:14,850
The offender is outside the window!

713
00:37:16,390 --> 00:37:17,640
The offender is outside the window!

714
00:37:19,660 --> 00:37:20,950
The offender is outside the window!

715
00:37:22,890 --> 00:37:24,140
The offender is outside the window!

716
00:37:53,590 --> 00:37:54,740
Let Dr. Zhai speak.

717
00:37:58,140 --> 00:37:58,620
Bastard!

718
00:37:58,860 --> 00:37:59,720
It's you!

719
00:38:01,510 --> 00:38:02,390
You bastard!

720
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:03,430
Bastard?

721
00:38:04,250 --> 00:38:05,100
Do you know him?

722
00:38:05,410 --> 00:38:06,030
This bastard,

723
00:38:06,770 --> 00:38:07,810
even if his skin was taken off,

724
00:38:07,850 --> 00:38:08,470
I will still recognize him.

725
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:10,090
His name is Liang Sanqi,

726
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:11,400
and he is a thief.

727
00:38:11,790 --> 00:38:14,610
He broke his waist, leg and ankle

728
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:16,170
when he was stealing.

729
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:18,560
My uncle treated him.

730
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:19,580
Now,

731
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:22,050
you pretended to be a ghost and committed crimes here,

732
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:24,620
and made people think the Hall of Life was haunted.

733
00:38:25,410 --> 00:38:27,360
You ungrateful bastard!

734
00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:28,140
I...

735
00:38:28,970 --> 00:38:31,350
Looks like you're not his accomplice.

736
00:38:34,230 --> 00:38:36,250
What do you mean?

737
00:38:36,820 --> 00:38:37,530
Sheriff Lu.

738
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:38,460
I...

739
00:38:40,710 --> 00:38:42,770
I suspected you

740
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:44,740
for not bringing me to the backyard earlier.

741
00:38:46,970 --> 00:38:48,910
Until I saw Meng Donglao's grave,

742
00:38:48,930 --> 00:38:49,810
I realized that

743
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:51,380
you were just afraid of

744
00:38:52,810 --> 00:38:54,510
me finding out

745
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:55,500
the grave in this attic.

746
00:39:01,330 --> 00:39:02,650
Liang Sanqi.

747
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:05,750
Meng Donglao's grave is inside.

748
00:39:06,530 --> 00:39:08,050
Aren't you afraid of his ghost

749
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:09,740
coming out from his grave

750
00:39:09,770 --> 00:39:10,740
to revenge you?

751
00:39:13,450 --> 00:39:14,490
At this point,

752
00:39:15,690 --> 00:39:16,970
I have nothing to say.

753
00:39:18,090 --> 00:39:19,000
Where are the heads

754
00:39:19,330 --> 00:39:20,130
of the victims?

755
00:39:21,090 --> 00:39:21,780
Well...

756
00:39:22,620 --> 00:39:23,790
I can't tell you.

757
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:28,210
How dare you!

758
00:39:28,820 --> 00:39:29,990
The 12 women

759
00:39:31,270 --> 00:39:32,710
were indeed killed by me.

760
00:39:33,310 --> 00:39:33,770
I admit it.

761
00:39:34,230 --> 00:39:34,730
But

762
00:39:35,340 --> 00:39:37,400
you want to parade me through the streets?

763
00:39:38,910 --> 00:39:40,160
You can't do it.

764
00:39:59,020 --> 00:39:59,610
Sheriff Lu.

765
00:40:00,020 --> 00:40:00,420
I...

766
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:02,090
He asked for it.

767
00:40:02,710 --> 00:40:03,430
No wonder.

768
00:40:04,230 --> 00:40:05,390
Hurry up. I got it.

769
00:40:05,540 --> 00:40:06,380
I got it! Hurry!

770
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,640
Look, what's wrong?

771
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:08,910
The murderer has been caught. He's inside.

772
00:40:08,930 --> 00:40:10,020
It's him. They got him.

773
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:10,980
Look.

774
00:40:11,420 --> 00:40:12,020
How is it?

775
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:13,320
I think they've caught the murderer.

776
00:40:13,690 --> 00:40:14,940
He had been hiding

777
00:40:14,970 --> 00:40:16,070
in the attic pretending as a ghost.

778
00:40:16,330 --> 00:40:17,360
He's inside.

779
00:40:18,740 --> 00:40:19,340
Let's go.

780
00:40:19,540 --> 00:40:20,900
Let's go.

781
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:24,190
Hurry up.

782
00:40:24,220 --> 00:40:25,020
Let's go and have a look.

783
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:26,800
Where is it?

784
00:40:27,980 --> 00:40:28,740
Get out of the way!

785
00:40:29,330 --> 00:40:29,890
Him?

786
00:40:30,570 --> 00:40:31,270
It's him!

787
00:40:31,670 --> 00:40:32,870
He was the one who put me to sleep

788
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:34,460
and killed my lady.

789
00:40:34,970 --> 00:40:35,830
Bastard!

790
00:40:36,110 --> 00:40:36,590
Bastard!

791
00:40:36,620 --> 00:40:37,590
Give me my daughter back!

792
00:40:37,620 --> 00:40:38,330
Give me my daughter back!

793
00:40:38,460 --> 00:40:39,060
Trample him!

794
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:41,180
Sheriff Lu,

795
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:43,420
these are the relatives of the victims.

796
00:40:44,250 --> 00:40:45,300
I'm afraid that we can't stop them.

797
00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:46,230
You evil thing!

798
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:48,020
You heartless monster!

799
00:40:49,340 --> 00:40:49,890
Master,

800
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:51,620
the bastard has killed

801
00:40:51,650 --> 00:40:52,780
so many women.

802
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:55,240
If I were her family,

803
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:56,370
I would do the same.

804
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:00,060
That's too much.

805
00:41:00,860 --> 00:41:02,100
Darn it.

806
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:04,280
Who ask you to scare me last time? You deserve it!

807
00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:06,860
Who ask you to pretend as a ghost? You deserve to die!

808
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:08,740
Sheriff Lu,

809
00:41:10,570 --> 00:41:11,420
look carefully.

810
00:41:17,190 --> 00:41:18,220
What are you doing?

811
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:19,970
Didn't we have a deal?

812
00:41:20,210 --> 00:41:22,120
Today is the seventh day.

813
00:41:22,250 --> 00:41:23,960
The murderer has been executed.

814
00:41:24,060 --> 00:41:24,700
Sheriff Lu,

815
00:41:25,060 --> 00:41:26,410
you avenged my daughter.

816
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:28,740
I'm swallowing

817
00:41:29,050 --> 00:41:30,740
this stone willingly.

818
00:41:31,220 --> 00:41:32,590
I didn't mean it,

819
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:34,310
why did you take it seriously?

820
00:41:34,630 --> 00:41:35,560
That won't do.

821
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:36,960
Everyone in the Ju County

822
00:41:36,990 --> 00:41:38,460
knows our bet.

823
00:41:38,620 --> 00:41:39,700
If I don't fulfill it,

824
00:41:39,820 --> 00:41:41,980
how can I continue to live here in the future?

825
00:41:43,070 --> 00:41:43,670
Besides,

826
00:41:44,180 --> 00:41:45,660
on the day you took office,

827
00:41:45,980 --> 00:41:47,210
I've said that you are useless.

828
00:41:47,670 --> 00:41:48,940
You are an imperial official,

829
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:50,620
but I offended you.

830
00:41:51,310 --> 00:41:52,660
I deserve this punishment.

831
00:41:55,180 --> 00:41:56,580
How did you offend me?

832
00:41:56,970 --> 00:41:58,200
If you hadn't provoked me,

833
00:41:58,500 --> 00:41:59,090
I'm afraid that

834
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:01,260
I won't catch the murderer so soon.

835
00:42:02,150 --> 00:42:02,860
Besides,

836
00:42:03,580 --> 00:42:04,610
can you swallow

837
00:42:05,100 --> 00:42:06,100
such a big stone?

838
00:42:08,490 --> 00:42:10,500
The murderer has taken his own life.

839
00:42:11,370 --> 00:42:12,530
But the victims' heads

840
00:42:13,250 --> 00:42:14,420
are still missing.

841
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:19,640
I'm sorry.

842
00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:20,740
This...

843
00:42:20,980 --> 00:42:22,340
Please don't do this.

844
00:42:22,620 --> 00:42:23,290
This...

845
00:42:23,620 --> 00:42:25,570
I'll keep this stone.

846
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:27,880
I'll keep it with me

847
00:42:28,370 --> 00:42:29,320
to motivate myself.

848
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:31,590
[Loser]

849
00:42:29,550 --> 00:42:31,100
I'll never be a loser.

850
00:42:32,410 --> 00:42:33,190
Although the murderer is dead,

851
00:42:33,730 --> 00:42:35,330
we must not slack off.

852
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:37,630
We should find the victims' heads as soon as possible.

853
00:42:37,740 --> 00:42:38,060
Yes.

854
00:42:38,210 --> 00:42:38,690
Yes.

855
00:42:39,490 --> 00:42:41,600
On behalf of my dead granddaughter,

856
00:42:41,780 --> 00:42:43,700
I would like to thank you.

857
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:47,600
I thank you on behalf of my wife.

858
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:49,430
Thank you, Sheriff Lu.

859
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:02,770
It's a blessing for the people of Ju County

860
00:43:04,060 --> 00:43:06,920
to have such a great sheriff.

871
00:44:17,230 --> 00:44:23,130
♫The heaven and earth are held together by a strong will♫

872
00:44:24,130 --> 00:44:25,920
♫The people are in peace♫

873
00:44:26,140 --> 00:44:30,290
♫Carving right and wrong into a clear heart♫

874
00:44:30,750 --> 00:44:31,970
♫The truth♫

875
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:35,590
♫Will reinterpret this justice♫

876
00:44:37,470 --> 00:44:41,750
♫Even if there is fog♫

877
00:44:42,390 --> 00:44:44,740
♫Even if there are invisible waves♫

878
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:48,340
♫I'll tell the story of the fate♫

879
00:44:50,430 --> 00:44:54,860
♫Tell the love of the world♫

880
00:44:56,150 --> 00:44:58,350
♫For the memory of grace♫

881
00:44:59,270 --> 00:45:01,650
♫And the resentment is not yet over♫

882
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:08,070
♫The rivers and mountains are immortal, the clouds are overturned♫

883
00:45:09,010 --> 00:45:15,210
♫To be consoled by the truth, even with thorns on my back♫

884
00:45:15,530 --> 00:45:19,930
♫Only for justice♫

885
00:45:21,900 --> 00:45:28,180
♫That I seek a truth for this long, lonely night♫

886
00:45:28,450 --> 00:45:34,350
♫The heaven and earth are held together by a strong will♫

887
00:45:35,380 --> 00:45:37,440
♫The people are in peace♫

888
00:45:37,460 --> 00:45:41,900
♫Carving right and wrong into a clear heart♫

889
00:45:42,620 --> 00:45:43,990
♫The truth♫

890
00:45:44,020 --> 00:45:47,750
♫Will reinterpret this justice♫

891
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:54,110
♫Even if there are a thousand sails, it's not a waste of time♫

892
00:45:54,480 --> 00:46:00,660
♫What I am afraid of is the unrighted wrong♫

893
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:03,190
♫What is the meaning of life and death?♫

894
00:46:03,410 --> 00:46:07,550
♫I'll paint the sunshine into the landscape♫

895
00:46:07,870 --> 00:46:09,580
♫The spirit of righteousness♫

896
00:46:09,740 --> 00:46:13,160
♫Exists for the one I care♫
