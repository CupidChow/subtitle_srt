[Episode 10]

4
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:47,440
Yesterday, Prefectural Governor Xiong mentioned

5
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:49,759
to have you escorted back to the north.

6
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:52,220
When will you set off?

7
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:54,190
Has my being here annoyed you?

8
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:55,110
Don't get me wrong.

9
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:59,300
I just don't want your father to worry about you.

10
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:02,260
You're actually afraid

11
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:03,420
that people will gossip

12
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:04,800
about me living with you.

13
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:06,260
To tell you the truth,

14
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,510
Xue Huan and I

15
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:09,130
have found a house

16
00:02:09,169 --> 00:02:10,270
next to the Commander's residence.

17
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:12,250
I'll go rent it tomorrow

18
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:13,180
and move in immediately.

19
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:15,110
That's not what I mean.

20
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:17,590
I know.

21
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:19,829
I don't want to put you in a dilemma.

22
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:22,170
How's that a dilemma?

23
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:27,480
I'm the Military Commander of Nanzhou.

24
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:29,380
Who lives in my residence

25
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:30,480
is not Lu Lingfeng's decision

26
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,470
to make.

27
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:32,480
Ridiculous.

28
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:37,060
I'm not surprised he's behind it.

29
00:02:41,770 --> 00:02:43,320
If you moved out,

30
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:44,410
Lu Lingfeng would think

31
00:02:44,579 --> 00:02:46,410
he bested you and me.

32
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:47,780
He'd be even cockier

33
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:49,730
in the future.

34
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:50,700
We can't let that happen.

35
00:02:55,210 --> 00:02:56,829
I have an idea.

36
00:02:58,300 --> 00:02:59,350
What is it?

37
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:03,370
I'm actually a bit embarrassed to say it.

38
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:05,870
Hope you don't think

39
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:08,770
that I intend to take advantage of you.

40
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:14,000
Xue Huan.

41
00:03:14,450 --> 00:03:14,920
Take this sword.

42
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:16,350
It's for me?

43
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:18,810
Thank you, sir.

44
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:24,020
This sword...

45
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:27,110
It's not sharpened.

46
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:29,560
To sharpen a sword means to kill.

47
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:31,160
Killing is too brutal

48
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,050
for a young lad like you.

49
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:33,350
Hone your skills first.

50
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,829
We'll practice a little longer today.

51
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:40,600
It may be the last time

52
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:42,650
I train you.

53
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:43,579
Why?

54
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:45,620
You've been in Nanzhou for days.

55
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:46,900
Don't you need to go back to the capital?

56
00:03:47,210 --> 00:03:47,980
If Miss Xijun decides to go back,

57
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:49,750
you'll have to escort her.

58
00:03:55,070 --> 00:03:55,570
Xue Huan,

59
00:03:56,410 --> 00:03:57,230
forget the crap

60
00:03:57,260 --> 00:03:58,140
you learned before.

61
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,560
What I teach you tonight

62
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:02,540
will definitely come into handy in the future.

[The Commander's residence]

64
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:40,890
Glad to see you, Prefectural Governor Xiong.

65
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:42,700
I didn't know you were coming,

66
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:44,330
or I'd have waited for you by the gate.

67
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,159
Sheriff Su invited me here.

68
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:49,280
He hasn't told you

69
00:04:49,409 --> 00:04:50,270
the great news yet?

70
00:04:58,090 --> 00:04:59,650
Look at this.

71
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:02,050
I ordered this delicacy from Gourmet Restaurant.

72
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:03,080
How is it?

73
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:05,850
All the famous delicacies of Nanzhou

74
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,670
are on this table.

75
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:09,990
I'm so good at arranging celebrations like this,

76
00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:11,280
aren't I?

77
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:13,560
Of course. You did a great job.

78
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:16,150
May I know what are we celebrating?

79
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,460
I've thought about it.

80
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:21,220
Miss Xijun is leaving soon,

81
00:05:21,890 --> 00:05:23,620
so I bet this is a farewell meal.

82
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:26,560
Why did you call it a celebration?

83
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:29,340
Who told you Miss Xijun is leaving?

84
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:32,190
This celebration is specially

85
00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:34,970
held for Miss Xijun.

86
00:05:35,570 --> 00:05:36,190

87
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:37,350
You...

88
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:37,950
What?

89
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,980
You object to

90
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:41,850
me becoming Xijun's sworn brother?

91
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:46,700
When did that happen?

92
00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:52,700
In just one day,

93
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,860
you found clues

94
00:05:55,890 --> 00:05:56,770
for two long-pending cases.

95

Everyone working for you

96

is so impressed and excited

97
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:01,420
that they've been focusing all their attention on the cases.

98
00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:04,930
No wonder you haven't heard of this great news.

99
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:07,720
Come on, Minister Lu.

100
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:09,390
Raise your glass.

101

Let's propose a toast to Commander Su and Miss Xijun.

102

Congratulations.

103

Congratulations.

105

Why are you sitting still?

106
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:24,430
Devious.

107
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:27,530
Who are you referring to?

108
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,020
Ask Commander Su.

109
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:29,950
He knows the answer.

110
00:06:32,890 --> 00:06:35,230
Miss Xijun is the daughter of Assistant Minister Pei,

111
00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:37,290
who is in charge of

112
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:38,930
the Ministry of Personnel Administration.

113
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:40,750
It's very likely

114
00:06:41,450 --> 00:06:42,840
that he'll become the Prime Minister in the future.

115
00:06:43,450 --> 00:06:44,060
Su Wuming,

116
00:06:44,659 --> 00:06:45,250
by becoming Xijun's sworn brother,

117
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:46,380
you're actually

118
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:48,200
paving the way for your career.

119
00:06:49,570 --> 00:06:51,620
So that's what it is.

120
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:54,090
I never knew you were so scheming.

121
00:06:54,370 --> 00:06:56,159
You successfully fooled me.

122
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:57,260
I thought

123
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:58,840
you're doing this for Lu Lingfeng.

124
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:00,420
-You get him wrong. -Xijun.

Lu Lingfeng.

126
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:06,670
Every man has ambitions.

127
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:08,230
Even if I truly mean to ride on

128
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:10,370
the coattails of Assistant Minister Pei,

129
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,290
what's wrong with that?

130
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:13,820
Su Wuming.

131
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:15,650
Do you mean it?

132
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:16,220
See?

133
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,760
You don't believe it yourself.

134
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:21,040
Wait a second.

135
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:23,590
I'm not following you.

136
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:25,140
What are you talking about?

137
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:28,150
I'm so confused.

138
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:30,460
Su Wuming.

139
00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:32,409
I'm grateful for all your efforts,

140
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:33,830
but you're just

141
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:36,409
making things harder for me.

142
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:38,060
How does my having a sworn brother

143
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,830
make things harder for you?

144
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:44,290
Prefectural Governor Xiong,

145
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:45,750
I and my brother

146
00:07:45,890 --> 00:07:46,630
invited you today

147
00:07:46,650 --> 00:07:47,680
to be our witness.

148
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,030
Master Fed prepared

149
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:50,020
so many delicacies for us.

150
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:51,260
Let's start eating.

151
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:52,730
You're right.

152
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:54,180
Let's start eating.

153
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:55,310
Yeah.

154
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:56,100
I can't wait.

155
00:07:56,290 --> 00:07:57,560
Minister Lu, let's drink.

156
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:06,660
We have two things to celebrate today.

157
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,620
Two things?

158
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:09,670
What's the other thing?

159
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:13,930
Minister Lu has accepted me as his disciple.

160
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,340
He'll teach me martial arts.

161
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,340
Last night, he gave me an amazing sword.

162
00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:20,230
Lu Lingfeng.

163
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:22,590
You have a disciple

164
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:23,860
at such a young age?

165
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:24,900
That's very meaningful.

166
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:26,060
Why didn't you tell us?

167
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:28,140
Yes.

168
00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:30,320
I took Xue Huan as my disciple.

169
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,059
As you can see, Mr. Xiong,

170
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:34,419
there's only a handful of people

171
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:36,580
living in this humble place,

172
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:39,840
but we have two pieces of great news today.

173
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:40,770
How wonderful!

174
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:42,559
Lu Lingfeng.

175
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:44,800
Now you can lift your glass, right?

176
00:08:45,530 --> 00:08:47,290
Yeah. That's right.

177
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:49,640
Prefectural Governor Xiong,

178
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:51,340
you're the witness to this memorable moment

179
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:52,450
for me and my disciple Xue Huan.

180
00:08:52,650 --> 00:08:53,940
My honor.

181
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:56,340
Congratulations!

182
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:58,300
Let's drink!

183
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:08,040
I didn't know tea was so prevalent in Nanzhou.

184
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:10,260
Everyone from commoners to officials

185
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:12,520
is enjoying it.

186
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:14,310
Yeah.

187
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:17,620
Nanzhou is abundant in tea.

188
00:09:18,010 --> 00:09:19,680
Zhong Boqi, one of Nanzhou Four Scholars,

189
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:22,030
is famous for his mastery in tea ceremony.

190
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:26,240
From planting tea, picking tea, making tea,

191
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:28,400
to the water used to brew tea,

192
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:30,440
the cup used to contain tea,

193
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:32,750
all these

194
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:34,190
etiquettes and rules

195
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:36,290
were set by Zhong Boqi.

196
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:37,220
By the way,

197
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:39,390
I've heard that Chang'an black tea

198
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:42,190
is very famous in the capital.

199
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:47,420
Yeah.

200
00:09:47,770 --> 00:09:48,870
It is very famous.

201
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:49,860
Prefectural governor!

202
00:09:50,170 --> 00:09:50,850
Prefectural governor!

203
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:52,380
Prefectural governor,

204
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:54,340
a letter from Zhong Boqi arrived just now,

205
00:09:54,410 --> 00:09:56,300
saying that Lu Gongfu, the Master of Guqin,

206
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:57,630
succumbed to illness last night.

207
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:04,680
The mourning hall is set

208
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:06,100
in his hut in the suburbs.

209
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,100
When do you plan

210
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,430
to extend you condolences?

211
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:13,110
Lu Gongfu?

212
00:10:14,170 --> 00:10:15,970
[Thank you for coming on such short notice.]

213
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:38,690
I'm Ouyang Quan.

214
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:40,960
Greetings, officers.

215
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:45,540
You came to offer your condolences too?

216
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:48,720
Why didn't you go inside?

217
00:10:49,050 --> 00:10:50,810
I'm a merchant.

218
00:10:51,730 --> 00:10:53,970
I don't want to disturb the peace of the respectful scholar.

219
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:55,950
I'm taking my leave.

220
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:05,700
Lu Gongfu died of illness.

221
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:07,020
Ouyang Quan must

222
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:08,220
be as sad as

223
00:11:08,310 --> 00:11:09,640
as Zhong and Leng.

224
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:13,640
What do you mean by that, sir?

225
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:15,630
The painting of the Stone Bridge he owns

226
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:17,060
becomes worthless now.

227
00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:19,340
Worthless?

228
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:45,730
[Memorial Tablet for Lu Gongfu, the Master of Guqin, one of Nanzhou Four Scholars]

229
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,120
Thank you for coming.

230
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:02,660
How did this happen?

231
00:12:02,890 --> 00:12:04,410
After Yuanfu died,

232
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,390
Gongfu wouldn't eat or drink.

233
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:08,290
He was overwhelmed by grief.

234
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:10,370
On the day of Yuanfu's funeral,

235
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:13,180
when playing the Guqin in front of Yuanfu's grave,

236
00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:16,020
he actually broke the strings of that ancient Guqin.

237
00:12:17,090 --> 00:12:19,600
Everyone could see

238
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:21,550
that he was grief-stricken.

239
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,600
Last night, he fell ill all of a sudden

240
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:28,800
and died very soon.

241
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:31,910
He's gone with that broken Guqin.

242
00:12:32,810 --> 00:12:33,430
What illness took his life?

243
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:34,990
Chest pain.

244
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:39,250
Gongfu died of heartache.

245
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:41,950
Gongfu.

246
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:43,420
Yuanfu.

247
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:46,020
You were so cruel.

248
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:48,620
How could you leave me and Boqi

249
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,700
alone in this world?

250
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,430
Do you know anyone

251
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:00,650
who may harbor resentment against Lu Gongfu?

252
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:02,530
Who are you?

253
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,300
What do you mean?

254
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:08,630
I'm Lu Lingfeng, the acting Minister of Justice.

255
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:10,430
I suggest

256
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:12,880
that we open the coffin for an autopsy.

257
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,000
Open the coffin?

258
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:15,690
No way!

259
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:18,380
Gongfu just drew his last breath.

260
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:20,550
He'd rather be left in peace!

261
00:13:22,370 --> 00:13:24,230
I saw Lu Gongfu a few days ago.

262
00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:25,640
I heard him playing the Guqin.

263
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:27,450
Judging from his music,

264
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:29,450
I don't think he suffered from any old illness.

265
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,430
His sudden death

266
00:13:32,090 --> 00:13:33,180
doesn't make any sense.

267
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:36,140
Do you mean

268
00:13:36,410 --> 00:13:38,000
Gongfu was murdered?

269
00:13:39,370 --> 00:13:39,930
Leng Ji,

270
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,390
you call yourself a well-educated scholar,

271
00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:43,980
but I only see impertinence

272
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,760
in your behavior.

273
00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:48,030
Besides, there're other exalted officials here

274
00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:49,410
in the mourning hall.

275
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:50,900
You can't threaten me with that.

276
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:52,810
I won't flinch even the Prime Minister is here!

277
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:54,750
Listen carefully,

278
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:56,490
Gongfu died

279
00:13:57,220 --> 00:13:58,620
because he was heartbroken

280
00:13:59,010 --> 00:13:59,850
after Yuanfu's death.

281
00:14:00,410 --> 00:14:01,230
That's the truth.

282
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:02,790
You don't understand

283
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:04,020
the friendship we shared.

284
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,710
You shouldn't be surprised

285
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:07,180
even if I and Boqi

286
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:08,860
died with them.

287
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:10,970
Leng Ji.

288
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:12,180
Calm down.

289
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:13,390
Calm down.

290
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,320
So you won't let me

291
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:21,290
perform the autopsy?

292
00:14:23,370 --> 00:14:24,450
To do that,

293
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:26,700
you'll have to

294
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:27,400
kill me first.

295
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:29,560
As you wish.

296
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:31,100
Minister Lu.

297
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:31,930
Take it easy.

298
00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:33,610
Minister Lu,

299
00:14:34,330 --> 00:14:36,370
Nanzhou Four Scholars

300
00:14:36,970 --> 00:14:38,750
are as highly esteemed in Nanzhou as officials like me.

301
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:39,860
Yeah.

302
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,810
Don't push them so hard.

303
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:44,630
Lu Lingfeng is the acting Minister of Justice,

304
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:46,940
conducting local criminal investigations.

305
00:14:47,370 --> 00:14:51,100
Lu Gongfu died so sudden a death.

306
00:14:51,130 --> 00:14:52,150
It's his job

307
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:53,860
to carry out an autopsy.

308
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:55,940
His request is justifiable.

309
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:56,500
You...

310
00:14:57,170 --> 00:14:59,420
Mr. Leng is overcome with grief

311
00:14:59,510 --> 00:15:00,900
after Lu Gongfu's death.

312
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:03,910
It's indeed too much for you

313
00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:04,860
that Minister Lu asked to do the autopsy right now.

314
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,210
I understand you, but…

315
00:15:07,230 --> 00:15:09,610
Who are you?

316
00:15:11,330 --> 00:15:12,630
The new Military Commander of Nanzhou.

317
00:15:13,130 --> 00:15:14,260
We met him

318
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:15,220
on Yuanfu's funeral.

319
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:18,210
There's nothing you can do here.

320
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:19,950
Leave please.

321
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:22,680
Gongfu,

322
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:25,700
you should've taken me with you.

323
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:33,480
Well...

324
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:38,830
My condolences.

325
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:40,940
We'll leave now.

326
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:44,190
I'll leave too.

327
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:52,710
That Minister Lu thought

328
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:54,940
the death of Gongfu is suspicious.

329
00:15:55,930 --> 00:15:56,500
Ji,

330
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:59,920
do you really think he was just making a fuss?

331
00:16:12,090 --> 00:16:12,740
Minister Lu,

332
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:14,700
before you asked

333
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:16,060
to do the autopsy,

334
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:16,480
You...

335
00:16:17,430 --> 00:16:19,400
You should've discussed it with me.

336
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,080
Yes.

337
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:21,780
You took me unawares.

338
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:23,200
I didn't know what to say.

339
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:24,250
There are no fixed rules

340
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:26,070
in investigations.

341
00:16:28,130 --> 00:16:28,470
You...

342
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:30,270
You can't just ask that

343
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,710
without any good reason!

344
00:16:32,930 --> 00:16:35,340
I believe Minister Lu has a good reason

345
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,690
for asking that.

346
00:16:38,090 --> 00:16:38,600
Right?

347
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:42,340
Nonetheless, you were still at fault

348
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,410
in not letting the prefectural governor

349
00:16:44,430 --> 00:16:46,690
and the administrator know your doubts.

350
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:47,030
Yeah.

351
00:16:47,050 --> 00:16:48,650
Otherwise,

352
00:16:49,370 --> 00:16:50,720
how can they trust you in further investigations?

353
00:16:54,350 --> 00:16:54,660
Fine.

354
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:56,540
Gentlemen,

355
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:58,380
did you see

356
00:16:58,410 --> 00:17:00,200
Lu Gongfu's Guqin just now?

357
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:06,550
It's an antique from the Three Kingdoms Period.

358
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:07,790
It's priceless.

359
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:09,859
Even if its strings are broken,

360
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:11,839
we should be able to see its intact wooden plank.

361
00:17:22,790 --> 00:17:23,420
Ji,

362
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:26,099
I somehow have the feeling

363
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:28,140
that something is missing in this room.

364
00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:30,230
Missing?

365
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:32,780
What's missing?

366
00:17:33,890 --> 00:17:35,190
I can't find the Guqin

367
00:17:35,910 --> 00:17:36,480
Gongfu used to play.

368
00:17:37,330 --> 00:17:37,980
Well…

369
00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:41,530
Ji,

370
00:17:42,570 --> 00:17:43,840
you're the first

371
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:44,880
to find Gongfu deceased.

372
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:46,490
Are you

373
00:17:47,570 --> 00:17:49,330
holding out on me?

374
00:17:50,390 --> 00:17:52,090
I...

375
00:18:00,550 --> 00:18:02,230
You do have an eye for good stuff.

376
00:18:02,730 --> 00:18:03,370
Sir,

377
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:04,950
this is the shoe that Confucius

378
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:06,790
once wore when traveling around different countries.

379
00:18:12,850 --> 00:18:14,700
But as far as I know,

380
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:18,670
the armory in Luoyang once caught on fire in the West Jin Dynasty.

381
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:21,750
The shoe

382
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:23,100
Confucius once wore,

383
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:26,100
together with the sword that Emperor Gaozu of Han

384
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:28,140
used to slash the serpent before the uprising,

385
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:30,540
were both consumed by the fire.

386
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:32,530
It's recorded clearly

387
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:33,620
in history.

388
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:35,710
You think I'll pay you

389
00:18:35,730 --> 00:18:37,060
for this counterfeit?

390
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:39,500
Are you taking as a fool?

391
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:40,740
Get out!

392
00:18:41,530 --> 00:18:42,060
Go!

393
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:45,160
Only morons believe they can sell

394
00:18:45,210 --> 00:18:46,600
counterfeits to Treasure House.

395
00:18:46,990 --> 00:18:47,720
My master

396
00:18:47,770 --> 00:18:49,760
is an expert.

397
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:52,460
He has never made a slip for decades.

398
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:55,460
Let's go.

399
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:02,170
The whole Nanzhou knows I, Lu Li, am rich.

400
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:04,030
But they don't know

401
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:04,940
that I travelled all the way here from Chang'an

402
00:19:04,970 --> 00:19:06,250
merely for the other half of a treasure.

403
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:09,740
Now I've gained the first half,

404
00:19:10,410 --> 00:19:12,190
all I need is the painting of the Stone Bridge.

405
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:14,420
Well…

406
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:15,780
I should not ask about it but…

407
00:19:16,370 --> 00:19:17,620
That Guqin...

408
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:18,820
You know you shouldn't ask about it,

409
00:19:18,850 --> 00:19:20,470
but you asked anyway?

410
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:25,220
Master,

411
00:19:25,730 --> 00:19:27,930
you've been in Nanzhou for four or five years.

412
00:19:28,530 --> 00:19:29,880
That's a long time.

413
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:31,310
That Ouyang Quan

414
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:32,450
is so tough and stubborn.

415
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,170
You visited him so many times.

416
00:19:34,630 --> 00:19:35,570
The price you offered him

417
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:38,050
made me shudder.

418
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:40,240
But he still wouldn't sell

419
00:19:41,570 --> 00:19:42,940
the painting of the Stone Bridge to you.

420
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:45,190
That painting will be mine sooner or later.

421
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:47,220
It won't take long.

422
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:50,020
I'll never

423
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:52,250
visit him or beg him

424
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:53,650
to sell me that painting again.

425
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:56,580
He will come to me

426
00:19:57,260 --> 00:19:59,730
and offer me that painting willingly.

427
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:01,010
How...

428
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:33,880
I finally found you.

429
00:20:34,790 --> 00:20:36,830
Ouyang Quan came again.

430
00:20:37,050 --> 00:20:37,990
How are you today?

431
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:40,620
It's an effort for me to find you.

432
00:20:40,730 --> 00:20:41,870
Scholars, farmers, artisans, and merchants.

433
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:43,120
You are in the lowest class of the four classes.

434
00:20:43,810 --> 00:20:45,650
Why are you, a merchant, so hellbent on

435
00:20:45,670 --> 00:20:47,140
seeking the company of the four of us?

436
00:20:47,170 --> 00:20:48,800
Please accept me.

437
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:51,580
Make me the fifth scholar.

438
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:52,350
If you agree,

439
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:53,930
I'll offer you free booze

440
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:55,590
until the end of your lives.

441
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:57,450
No one in Nanzhou

442
00:20:57,780 --> 00:20:59,190
can hold his liquor as well as I can.

443
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:01,920
I think I should be

444
00:21:02,370 --> 00:21:03,800
the reincarnation of

445
00:21:04,570 --> 00:21:05,700
Liu Ling, the one known for drinking in the Seven Sages of Bamboo Grove.

446
00:21:06,910 --> 00:21:08,590
Liu Ling was a sage enjoying drinking.

447
00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:09,430
But you

448
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:11,660
are merely a drunkard.

449
00:21:19,230 --> 00:21:20,560
Who are you to laugh at me?

450
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:28,600
Mr. Lu,

451
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:30,680
you are a kind man.

452
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:32,100
Please,

453
00:21:32,810 --> 00:21:34,060
say something for me.

454
00:21:35,450 --> 00:21:36,420
What do you expect me to say?

455
00:21:47,410 --> 00:21:47,920
Who's it?

456
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:49,510
Master, it's me.

457
00:21:50,050 --> 00:21:51,180
A man who introduced himself as the new

458
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:52,750
acting Minister of Justice

459
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:53,950
came to Gourmet Restaurant.

460
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:55,310
He wants to have a drink with you.

461
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:57,180
Send him away.

462
00:21:58,380 --> 00:21:58,870
What?

463
00:21:59,650 --> 00:22:00,660
I'm not high-ranking enough to drink with him?

464
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:02,620
No. That's not the case.

465
00:22:02,910 --> 00:22:04,310
My master is very hospitable.

466
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:06,780
I'll treat you to a good meal

467
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:08,410
on his behalf.

468
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:09,350
Alright.

469
00:22:10,390 --> 00:22:12,190
Bring me some good booze.

470
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:13,280
Sure.

471
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:18,570
What are you doing, Headman Xie?

472
00:22:18,730 --> 00:22:20,050
I'm filling your glass.

473
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:21,650
Who told you we're here for drinking?

474
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:22,800
Have we made any progress on the case?

475
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:26,220
[Headman Xie, a Constable of Nanzhou]

476
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:27,630
Didn't you just

477
00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:28,340
ask for booze?

478
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:29,660
Ouyang Quan will pay the bill.

479
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:30,640
We can't leave without hurting his pocket.

480
00:22:32,630 --> 00:22:33,340
Have you forgotten

481
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:34,900
the old alcoholic in the Commander's residence?

482
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:36,050
The booze is for him.

483
00:22:36,670 --> 00:22:37,140
You have objections?

484
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:38,770
He has not.

485
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:42,120
[Headman Huang, a Constable of Nanzhou]

486
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:40,720
You're right.

487
00:22:41,210 --> 00:22:42,450
We haven't caught the criminal yet.

488
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:43,280
How can we drink?

489
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:46,100
Come on, Xie.

490
00:22:46,250 --> 00:22:47,370
Let's replace alcohol with tea

491
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:48,650
and propose a toast to Minister Lu.

492
00:22:49,130 --> 00:22:49,760
Headman Huang.

493
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:52,050
Are we here to eat and drink?

494
00:22:53,310 --> 00:22:53,890
Well…

495
00:22:54,170 --> 00:22:55,370
We came here

496
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:56,910
to meet Ouyang Quan.

497
00:22:57,790 --> 00:22:58,800
Since he's not coming,

498
00:22:59,160 --> 00:22:59,960
we can only "have" him

499
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:01,060
in our place.

500
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:03,630
You two do it now.

501
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:04,330
Yes.

502
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:04,610
Yes.

503
00:23:05,870 --> 00:23:06,320
Wait.

504
00:23:09,550 --> 00:23:10,670
Call a waiter for me

505
00:23:10,970 --> 00:23:11,740
to send the dishes

506
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:13,330
back to the Commander's residence.

507
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:15,070
Look!

508
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,520
We just had a feast at noon,

509
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:19,900
and they sent us another tableful of dishes at night.

510
00:23:20,710 --> 00:23:22,030
If I had known

511
00:23:22,130 --> 00:23:23,420
I could be well fed at this age,

512
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:24,880
I wouldn't have tried to kill myself

513
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:26,620
when I was young.

514
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:33,420
Well,

Let's eat.

Looks like you

519
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:41,190
have a lot of stories to tell.

520
00:23:41,570 --> 00:23:43,240
Tell us when we have the chance.

521
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:44,830
This, this wine is good.

522
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:45,510
Let's drink.

523
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:47,520
The wine, we have to leave aside.

524
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:49,080
Tonight,

525
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:50,820
I may need your help

526
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:51,750
with something.

527
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:53,250
What is it? Name it.

528
00:23:53,730 --> 00:23:55,500
This is as far as I can tell you.

529
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:57,680
After dinner, go to bed early.

530
00:23:57,980 --> 00:23:59,400
I'll call you when I need you.

531
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:03,970
You...

532
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:04,320
Move.

533
00:24:04,450 --> 00:24:05,030
What are you...

534
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:05,940
What...

535
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:07,350
Get in.

536
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:08,340
This...

537
00:24:08,850 --> 00:24:09,610
What are you...

538
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:13,380
What do you want?

539
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:14,130
You are here.

540
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:15,160
Have a seat.

541
00:24:18,250 --> 00:24:18,820
Sit down.

542
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:26,800
Greetings, Minister Lu.

543
00:24:27,650 --> 00:24:28,710
I'm just an acting minister.

544
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:30,350
I came from Chang'an.

545
00:24:31,350 --> 00:24:32,600
When I first arrived in Nanzhou,

546
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:34,500
I had a drink in your restaurant.

547
00:24:34,530 --> 00:24:35,290
That's right, right.

548
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:36,650
Yan Yuanfu's funeral

549
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:38,830
took place on that day.

550
00:24:38,870 --> 00:24:39,910
Since I'm new here,

551
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:41,680
many things I can only inquire secretly.

552
00:24:41,710 --> 00:24:43,860
I've heard that the Nanzhou Four Scholars

553
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:45,190
enjoy a high reputation.

554
00:24:45,430 --> 00:24:47,020
Many people want to join their group

555
00:24:47,130 --> 00:24:48,250
and become the fifth scholar.

556
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:51,540
The most desperate one among them

557
00:24:52,650 --> 00:24:54,240
is you, Mr. Ouyang.

558
00:24:54,870 --> 00:24:56,280
But they thought highly of themselves,

559
00:24:56,310 --> 00:24:57,480
and turned their nose up at everyone.

560
00:24:57,940 --> 00:24:59,460
So, it's natural

561
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:00,620
you held a grudge against them.

562
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:01,860
I...

563
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:03,560
I didn't!

564
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:06,750
But the day before yesterday, you went to Lu Gongfu

565
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:08,630
and tried to replace Yan Yuanfu

566
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:10,390
to become the new member of the Nanzhou Four Scholars.

567
00:25:10,410 --> 00:25:11,110
But you were kicked out of his house

568
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:12,180
by him.

569
00:25:12,550 --> 00:25:13,540
Is that true?

570
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:17,130
How did you know?

571
00:25:18,010 --> 00:25:19,270
It was a child cowherd

572
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:20,070
who told me.

573
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:22,120
I saw him

574
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:23,880
going through there.

575
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:26,540
You mean there?

576
00:25:26,570 --> 00:25:27,060
Get lost.

577
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:27,850
Mr. Lu.

578
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:28,870
Get out! Get out!

579
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:30,710
-Mr. Lu. Mr. Lu. -Get out!

580
00:25:31,690 --> 00:25:32,760
-Mr. Lu. -Let me tell you!

581
00:25:32,790 --> 00:25:34,170
None of the Nanzhou Four Scholars is replaceable.

582
00:25:34,630 --> 00:25:36,200
Stop dreaming.

583
00:25:37,010 --> 00:25:37,640
Lu...

584
00:25:40,110 --> 00:25:41,310
I didn't want anyone

585
00:25:41,650 --> 00:25:43,160
to know such an embarrassing thing about me.

586
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:47,090
But I didn't expect Your Honor to be so perceptive...

587
00:25:47,110 --> 00:25:47,960
Cut the flattering.

588
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:50,670
Because of this, you held a grudge against him

589
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,120
and you killed him, right?

590
00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:53,300
When did you do it?

591
00:25:53,430 --> 00:25:54,410
What weapon did you use?

592
00:25:54,510 --> 00:25:55,230
Say it!

593
00:25:56,350 --> 00:25:57,390
No, no!

594
00:25:57,620 --> 00:25:59,440
I didn't kill anyone.

595
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:01,250
Mr. Lu died last night.

596
00:26:01,390 --> 00:26:02,940
But I was at home at that time.

597
00:26:03,170 --> 00:26:04,170
If you don't believe me,

598
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:05,320
you can ask the people in my house.

599
00:26:05,350 --> 00:26:07,510
They can all testify for me.

600
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:35,140
Your Honor,

601
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:36,940
have you found it out?

602
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:38,220
Yes.

603
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:39,360
You were home all night.

604
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:45,580
Then please let me out of prison.

605
00:26:45,650 --> 00:26:46,820
When did I put you in prison?

606
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:47,840
I wanted

607
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:48,940
to ask you these at dinner tonight

608
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:50,430
to rule you out.

609
00:26:51,010 --> 00:26:52,080
But you didn't come,

610
00:26:52,430 --> 00:26:53,780
so I invited you here.

611
00:26:56,780 --> 00:26:57,860
It's my fault.

612
00:26:58,320 --> 00:26:59,600
All right. You can leave now.

613
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:02,030
Next time, if I want to question you…

614
00:27:02,290 --> 00:27:03,190
I'll come to you immediately.

615
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:04,480
I won't hesitate a bit.

616
00:27:12,270 --> 00:27:12,780
Keep an eye on him.

617
00:27:14,330 --> 00:27:15,170
What's the use of keeping an eye on him?

618
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:16,390
He's definitely not the murderer.

619
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,840
I never suspected him at the first place.

620
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:20,660
But I have my reason for you to watch him.

621
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:22,210
No negligence.

622
00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:23,390
Otherwise,

623
00:27:24,410 --> 00:27:25,770
I'll punish you.

624
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:26,980
Yes, yes.

625
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:29,760
By the way,

626
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:32,100
there was another person who wanted to be their disciple

627
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:33,380
but was humiliated in public.

628
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:34,200
What is his name again?

629
00:27:34,330 --> 00:27:35,140
Lin Bao.

630
00:27:36,580 --> 00:27:37,380
Have you found him?

631
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:38,770
Not yet.

632
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:40,870
But that person is very suspicious.

633
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:42,570
On the day of Yan Yuanfu's funeral,

634
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:44,500
someone heard him say something.

635
00:27:45,930 --> 00:27:47,000
Lu Gongfu,

636
00:27:48,050 --> 00:27:49,560
it's fine you wouldn't teach me

637
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:53,140
but you humiliated me.

638
00:27:54,060 --> 00:27:54,750
Wait and see.

639
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:56,710
I, Lin Bao,

640
00:27:57,580 --> 00:27:59,070
will take revenge on you.

641
00:28:00,730 --> 00:28:02,000
I sent someone to Lin Bao's house,

642
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:03,660
but he wasn't there.

643
00:28:04,570 --> 00:28:06,210
He seemed to be hiding.

644
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:07,750
But he has a lover.

645
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:09,090
The top girl of the Zixia Building.

646
00:28:09,410 --> 00:28:10,030
I've sent guards

647
00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:10,980
to surround the brothel.

648
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:12,790
How can you catch him that way?

649
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:13,750
Tell them to leave! Now!

650
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:15,120
Yes.

651
00:28:24,750 --> 00:28:25,420
Brother?

652
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:26,300
What's up?

653
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,080
Come on in.

654
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:27,990
No need.

655
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:30,790
I need a hand tonight.

656
00:28:31,450 --> 00:28:32,600
I wonder

657
00:28:32,860 --> 00:28:34,500
if you can help me?

658
00:28:35,550 --> 00:28:36,370
Sure.

659
00:28:41,140 --> 00:28:41,760
Brother.

660
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:44,690
Go back and rest now.

661
00:28:46,170 --> 00:28:47,070
I can't.

662
00:28:47,790 --> 00:28:48,900
I can't leave Gongfu here

663
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:50,180
alone.

664
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:51,920
I am here.

665
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:55,300
Before we bury him,

666
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:57,010
you and I

667
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:58,640
can't fall apart.

668
00:28:59,400 --> 00:28:59,900
How about this?

669
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:01,720
Tonight, I'll stay here for his wake.

670
00:29:02,390 --> 00:29:04,490
You go back and rest.

671
00:29:05,070 --> 00:29:06,760
Tomorrow night, you'll stay here for him.

672
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:09,370
Okay.

673
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:15,510
I hope he won't blame me.

674
00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:31,820
Be careful.

675
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:35,500
Are you alright?

676
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:41,540
They left.

677
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:42,700
It's our turn now.

678
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:44,970
This is so fun.

679
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:46,280
Wait, Master Fed.

680
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:47,840
Let me give your make-up a final touch.

681
00:29:48,810 --> 00:29:49,370
Okay.

682
00:29:57,860 --> 00:29:59,870
Lu Gongfu.

683
00:30:01,030 --> 00:30:03,320
Come with us.

684
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:05,410
Who's there?

685
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:12,790
Am I hallucinating?

686
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:23,610
Lu Gongfu.

687
00:30:24,590 --> 00:30:26,650
Come with us.

688
00:30:29,570 --> 00:30:31,200
Lu Gongfu.

689
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:35,040
Come with us.

690
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:36,340
Are you humans or ghosts?

691
00:30:36,830 --> 00:30:38,060
Stop! Don't come over!

692
00:30:38,630 --> 00:30:40,340
Under the order of the King of Hell,

693
00:30:40,850 --> 00:30:42,590
tonight, we're here

694
00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:45,250
for Lu Gongfu's three souls and six senses.

695
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:48,310
Now we have the souls and senses.

696
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:50,160
We will take our leave.

697
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:52,820
You two evil spirits!

698
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:53,960
Give me back my brother's souls!

699
00:30:55,580 --> 00:30:56,170
Stop!

700
00:31:29,570 --> 00:31:31,010
Sir, please come again.

701
00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:31,820
Of course, sweetheart.

702
00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:32,410
Go back quickly.

703
00:31:32,780 --> 00:31:33,460
Young Master.

704
00:31:33,570 --> 00:31:34,330
Mama.

705
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:35,540
What took you so long?

706
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:37,860
Girls, come out.

707
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:39,940
We have guests here. Hurry up.

708
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:41,060
Alright, beauty.

709
00:31:41,210 --> 00:31:42,060
Come to me.

710
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:43,620
Okay, come here.

711
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:44,540
This one is good.

712
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:45,540
Come, come.

713
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:46,140
Alright, alright.

714
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:46,660
Have a seat inside.

715
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:47,660
Come in.

716
00:31:54,540 --> 00:31:55,030
Aman.

717
00:31:57,220 --> 00:31:57,750
Aman.

718
00:31:58,680 --> 00:31:59,690
Leave Nanzhou with me now.

719
00:31:59,790 --> 00:32:00,680
Come. Get up.

720
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:04,780
Lin Bao!

721
00:32:05,050 --> 00:32:06,170
Surrender now!

722
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:08,860
Who do you work for?

723
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:10,570
Everyone!

724
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:15,180
Whose child are you?

725
00:32:15,210 --> 00:32:16,560
Stop messing around and go home.

726
00:32:16,710 --> 00:32:17,590
I'm not a child.

727
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:19,530
I'm here to arrest you under my teacher's order.

728
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:21,670
How?

729
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:22,950
Your knife doesn't have a cutting edge.

730
00:32:23,230 --> 00:32:23,950
Stop!

731
00:32:26,270 --> 00:32:27,470
I've checked

732
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:28,220
the whole Zixia Building.

733
00:32:28,430 --> 00:32:29,230
There are no officers.

734
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:30,420
You're just a kid.

735
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:31,750
Get lost if you want to live.

736
00:32:31,770 --> 00:32:32,880
Don't ruin my business.

737
00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:35,930
Fine.

738
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:37,700
Let me tell you.

739
00:32:37,950 --> 00:32:39,170
Your knife has no cutting edge,

740
00:32:40,780 --> 00:32:41,940
but my dagger has.

741
00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:43,580
I have killed someone.

742
00:32:44,130 --> 00:32:45,150
I am here just to catch you,

743
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:46,730
murderer!

744
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:25,600
Thank you for saving my life.

745
00:33:26,090 --> 00:33:27,160
How should I repay you?

746
00:33:30,170 --> 00:33:31,150
Give me your head

747
00:33:31,660 --> 00:33:32,440
as a thank you.

748
00:33:33,610 --> 00:33:34,250
Hero.

749
00:33:34,410 --> 00:33:35,230
Don't be afraid.

750
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:36,680
Not here.

751
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:38,860
If I cut your head off right here,

752
00:33:39,130 --> 00:33:39,900
no one will pay me.

753
00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:40,710
No, hero.

754
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:41,020
Let's go.

755
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:42,310
Hero!

756
00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:48,100
Stop!

757
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:49,770
Stop!

758
00:33:52,290 --> 00:33:52,960
Stop!

759
00:33:53,450 --> 00:33:54,080
Freeze!

760
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:55,080
Freeze! Stay where you are!

761
00:33:56,790 --> 00:33:57,180
After him!

762
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:27,060
Teacher!

763
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:28,310
He is Lin Bao!

764
00:34:28,409 --> 00:34:29,060
I know.

765
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:30,380
I've been watching him.

766
00:34:31,510 --> 00:34:33,020
Why couldn't you catch him in the room?

767
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:34,580
My knife!

768
00:34:34,790 --> 00:34:35,989
My knife is still a piece of scrap metal.

769
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:37,500
To catch a Guqin Player,

770
00:34:37,820 --> 00:34:39,239
one bamboo stick is enough.

771
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:39,980
Take it.

772
00:34:41,020 --> 00:34:42,250
I will watch you catch the thief.

773
00:34:42,770 --> 00:34:43,199
Yes.

774
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:48,900
Attack him!

775
00:34:49,179 --> 00:34:49,940
Check him out.

776
00:35:03,850 --> 00:35:04,700
I told you.

777
00:35:05,050 --> 00:35:06,720
He has some martial arts skills.

778
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:08,100
He sprained his ankle.

779
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:09,220
Attack him below his waist.

780
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:10,020
Yes.

781
00:35:21,430 --> 00:35:22,370
Remove his knife.

782
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:29,490
Teacher.

783
00:35:29,770 --> 00:35:30,480
I caught him.

784
00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:32,820
Stop!

785
00:35:33,290 --> 00:35:33,830
Freeze!

786
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:37,750
Let's see where you can run!

787
00:35:50,030 --> 00:35:52,100
[Nanzhou Prison]

788
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:54,180
Let go of me!

789
00:35:55,710 --> 00:35:56,590
Why did you arrest me!

790
00:35:56,820 --> 00:35:57,950
I really didn't kill anyone!

791
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:00,080
You admitted it yourself in Zixia Building.

792
00:36:00,340 --> 00:36:01,420
You said you had killed someone!

793
00:36:01,590 --> 00:36:02,110
No.

794
00:36:02,170 --> 00:36:03,260
I didn't.

795
00:36:03,490 --> 00:36:04,140
That's...

796
00:36:04,630 --> 00:36:05,570
I was just trying

797
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:06,730
to scare you.

798
00:36:13,220 --> 00:36:14,570
It's not easy

799
00:36:14,870 --> 00:36:15,880
to have you, a Guqin Player, here.

800
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:17,820
Let him taste

801
00:36:18,090 --> 00:36:19,500
all the punishments here.

802
00:36:20,060 --> 00:36:20,820
Otherwise,

803
00:36:21,210 --> 00:36:22,220
it's not worthy of his hard resistance.

804
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:26,620
I, I'll confess.

805
00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:29,460
That day,

806
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:30,700
I failed to become his disciple,

807
00:36:31,060 --> 00:36:32,120
and was humiliated.

808
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:34,210
So I wanted

809
00:36:34,820 --> 00:36:35,910
to take revenge on Lu Gongfu.

810
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:51,770
He didn't want to teach you so you killed him.

811
00:36:52,180 --> 00:36:53,280
Your name

812
00:36:53,620 --> 00:36:54,470
tomorrow will fill

813
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:55,460
the entire Nanzhou.

814
00:36:58,570 --> 00:36:59,300
Minister Lu,

815
00:36:59,930 --> 00:37:00,750
without an autopsy,

816
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:02,110
you could confirm that it is a homicide

817
00:37:03,490 --> 00:37:04,710
and arrest

818
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:05,700
the murderer.

819
00:37:06,050 --> 00:37:07,730
I admire you so much.

820
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:09,760
If the prefectural governor gets the news,

821
00:37:10,150 --> 00:37:11,690
he'll reward you handsomely.

822
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:15,070
Do you think I did it for the reward?

823
00:37:15,850 --> 00:37:16,290
Well...

824
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:19,440
Lin Bao.

825
00:37:20,810 --> 00:37:21,390
Where's the Guqin?

826
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:24,250
What, what Guqin?

827
00:37:24,470 --> 00:37:25,040
Cut to the chase.

828
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:26,540
Of course it's the one from the Three Kingdoms Period

829
00:37:26,580 --> 00:37:27,400
in Lu Gongfu's room.

830
00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:29,260
I don't know!

831
00:37:30,010 --> 00:37:31,170
You're a Guqin Player.

832
00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:32,350
You killed Lu Gongfu,

833
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:33,900
but you left his Guqin aside?

834
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:35,140
I really didn't steal it!

835
00:37:35,780 --> 00:37:36,300
I...

836
00:37:36,510 --> 00:37:38,160
I even regretted it.

837
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:44,860
Guqin.

838
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:46,170
Guqin!

839
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:58,380
I was too scared,

840
00:37:58,930 --> 00:38:00,000
so I didn't dare to go back.

841
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:01,870
You're lying.

842
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:03,410
If you didn't steal it,

843
00:38:03,410 --> 00:38:04,370
then why is the Guqin gone?

844
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:06,190
But I really didn't steal it!

845
00:38:06,220 --> 00:38:06,830
Your Honor!

846
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:10,750
Looks like you won't confess

847
00:38:10,780 --> 00:38:11,820
without torture.

848
00:38:12,020 --> 00:38:12,800
I'll leave him to you.

849
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:14,600
Until he confesses

850
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:15,930
where he hid the Guqin.

851
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:16,820
Yes.

852
00:38:17,380 --> 00:38:17,900
Your Honor,

853
00:38:17,930 --> 00:38:19,080
I really didn't take that Guqin.

854
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:19,540
Your Honor!

855
00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:20,740
Your Honor!

856
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:22,650
I really didn't take it.

857
00:38:23,060 --> 00:38:23,800
Let go of me!

858
00:38:24,130 --> 00:38:24,840
Your Honor.

859
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:25,580
Headman Huang,

860
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:27,210
did we also catch another man?

861
00:38:27,820 --> 00:38:29,020
He was a hitman, hired

862
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:29,650
by someone.

863
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:31,500
Please, don't torture me.

864
00:38:32,390 --> 00:38:33,780
My name is Tu Yanpi.

865
00:38:34,390 --> 00:38:36,420
I was hired by Zhong Boqi and Leng Ji.

866
00:38:37,930 --> 00:38:39,260
They hired me to catch Lin Bao,

867
00:38:39,860 --> 00:38:40,790
and find out

868
00:38:40,820 --> 00:38:42,080
the fact that he killed Lu Gongfu.

869
00:38:42,710 --> 00:38:44,060
At midnight in five days,

870
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:45,980
if I can bring him

871
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:47,220
to Lu Gongfu's mourning hall

872
00:38:47,690 --> 00:38:49,060
and to them,

873
00:38:49,970 --> 00:38:52,090
they will pay me 4,000 coins.

874
00:38:53,820 --> 00:38:55,610
Zhong Boqi, and Leng Ji.

875
00:38:56,130 --> 00:38:57,640
I thought you refused to open the coffin

876
00:38:58,560 --> 00:38:59,300
because

877
00:38:59,340 --> 00:39:01,140
you were worried about disrespecting the dead.

878
00:39:01,580 --> 00:39:02,700
I didn't expect

879
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:04,630
you to try to cover up the truth, avoid the government,

880
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:05,570
and hire people to commit murder.

881
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:08,870
How dare them!

882
00:39:11,060 --> 00:39:12,430
Then why does it have to be five days later?

883
00:39:13,130 --> 00:39:14,480
Because they want to,

884
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:15,770
the night before the funeral,

885
00:39:16,250 --> 00:39:17,570
in front of his coffin,

886
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:19,620
kill Lin Bao themselves.

887
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:21,700
These gentries' minds

888
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:22,960
are really twisted.

889
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:25,480
How can they call themselves gentries

890
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:26,990
after they did something like this.

891
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:29,700
Arrest them!

892
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:43,380
You got up so early, brother.

893
00:39:46,670 --> 00:39:47,900
So did you, my sister.

894
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:49,510
You were up all night, too?

895
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:51,260
How did you know

896
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:52,360
I stayed up all night?

897
00:39:52,380 --> 00:39:54,790
Lu Lingfeng just assumed his office,

898
00:39:54,820 --> 00:39:56,180
and he hasn't returned for the night.

899
00:39:57,490 --> 00:39:58,670
I was worried about him too.

900
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:01,380
I wasn't worried about him.

901
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:02,510
It's just that Xue Huan

902
00:40:02,540 --> 00:40:03,520
hasn't come back yet.

903
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:04,790
He's still young.

904
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:05,980
How am I not worried about him?

905
00:40:08,090 --> 00:40:09,720
Don't laugh at me, brother.

906
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:11,880
How dare I laugh at you?

907
00:40:12,190 --> 00:40:14,280
Thank you for your help last night.

908
00:40:14,590 --> 00:40:15,740
To express my gratitude,

909
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:18,710
I'll take you to visit

910
00:40:18,740 --> 00:40:19,800
Ouyang Quan

911
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:23,060
to see the painting of the Stone Bridge he collected.

912
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:24,330
Great!

913
00:40:53,380 --> 00:40:54,660
You are all here.

914
00:40:55,310 --> 00:40:56,350
Why didn't you invite me?

915
00:40:56,790 --> 00:40:58,960
I'm the God of Wine, Ouyang Quan.

916
00:40:59,970 --> 00:41:01,170
Ouyang Quan!

917
00:41:03,290 --> 00:41:05,450
Give me back my life!

918
00:41:05,810 --> 00:41:07,130
It is you, a drunkard merchant,

919
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:08,670
who killed my two brothers.

920
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,480
I will kill you!

921
00:41:10,950 --> 00:41:11,430
No.

922
00:41:21,290 --> 00:41:23,010
My lord, you had a nightmare again?

923
00:41:25,470 --> 00:41:26,010
Nonsense.

924
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:28,210
I didn't dream at all.

925
00:41:31,060 --> 00:41:31,850
Why are you here?

926
00:41:31,990 --> 00:41:33,870
Commander Su is here to visit.

927
00:41:34,670 --> 00:41:35,400
Commander?

928
00:41:37,460 --> 00:41:38,490
How many guards did he bring with him?

929
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:40,180
No one.

930
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:41,800
Only one person.

931
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:43,300
And it is a woman.

932
00:41:56,830 --> 00:41:58,270
It is really an honor

933
00:41:58,460 --> 00:41:59,500
to have you, Commander Su,

934
00:41:59,820 --> 00:42:01,190
in my humble house.

935
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:02,840
Mr. Ouyang,

936
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:04,140
are we

937
00:42:04,180 --> 00:42:05,500
being abrupt?

938
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:08,530
It's my honor to have you here.

939
00:42:08,820 --> 00:42:10,440
Not abrupt at all!

940
00:42:10,810 --> 00:42:11,530
OK.

941
00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:14,100
This is my sworn sister, Xijun.

942
00:42:15,540 --> 00:42:16,660
Nice to meet you.

943
00:42:17,410 --> 00:42:18,170
I'm sorry to bother you.

944
00:42:18,610 --> 00:42:20,520
The reason I am here with my sister

945
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:22,120
is that we want to appreciate

946
00:42:22,530 --> 00:42:24,300
one of your collection, the painting of the Stone Bridge.

947
00:42:26,740 --> 00:42:28,420
Why? We came at a bad time?

948
00:42:29,730 --> 00:42:30,820
Unfortunately,

949
00:42:31,420 --> 00:42:32,380
I just sold that painting

950
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:34,550
yesterday.

951
00:42:34,580 --> 00:42:35,140
Sold?

952
00:42:35,820 --> 00:42:37,190
May I ask who you sold it to?

953
00:42:37,850 --> 00:42:40,080
I sold it to a Persian merchant

954
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:42,700
who is going to Luoyang via Nanzhou.
