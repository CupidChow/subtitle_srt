[Episode 13]

4
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:21,300
It is said that the Nanzhou Four Scholars are like brothers.

5
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:23,970
Look at Zhong Boqi and Leng Ji.

6
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:25,190
They are in sync.

7
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:28,320
The tea was just ready,

8
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:30,300
and they arrived just on time.

9
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:31,310
Brother.

10
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:35,040
Brother.

11
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:35,470
Brother.

12
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:41,630
Long time no see.

13
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:43,110
How are you?

14
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:44,670
I miss you.

15
00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:47,660
Brother,

16
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,329
you're already in poor health.

17
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:52,390
Why did you come to the mountain?

18
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:54,670
Brother,

19
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,500
we are like blood brothers

20
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,510
for 15 years.

21
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,230
If I did not come today,

22
00:03:00,570 --> 00:03:02,550
Yuanfu's and Gongfu's souls

23
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,280
would blame me.

24
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,150
The tea is ready.

25
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:08,100
Follow me.

26
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:14,910
Come.

27
00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:16,990
-Please, brother. -After you, brother.

28
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:19,860
Commander Su,

29
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:21,340
do people in the capital

30
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:23,890
drink tea?

31
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:25,360
In Chang'an,

32
00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:27,640
most people who drink tea are scholar-officials,

33
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:29,870
it's rare for ordinary people to drink it.

34
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:32,570
I believe one day,

35
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:35,720
no matter where it is,

36
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:38,530
no matter who they are,

37
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,440
everyone will like tea.

38
00:03:41,570 --> 00:03:43,360
That's my wish too,

39
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,240
because I heard that

40
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:46,250
tea is

41
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:48,310
the drink of gentleman.

42
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:51,490
Brother.

43
00:03:58,810 --> 00:03:59,420
Mr. Zhong,

44
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:00,970
do you need a doctor?

45
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:02,780
No need.

46
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:04,260
I've suffered from it for a long time.

47
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:05,650
Since you've suffered from it for a long time,

48
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:07,410
you should find a doctor.

49
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:09,830
I have a guest named Chicken Fed.

50
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,880
He is a skillful doctor.

51
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:13,350
I'll ask him to check on you.

52
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,650
Where is the Chicken Fed?

53
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:20,240
Here.

54
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:21,860
I was sleeping soundly.

55
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:23,620
Why are you shouting at me?

56
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:25,760
Is there someone who's seeking for medical treatment?

57
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:26,850
Yes.

58
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:32,890
Chicken Fed,

59
00:04:33,290 --> 00:04:35,780
Mr. Zhong coughed up blood just now.

60
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:38,180
After I came to Nanzhou,

61
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:42,000
I found many patients in Nanzhou

62
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:43,190
also coughed like this.

63
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:45,740
It must be the same disease.

64
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:47,310
You are a doctor?

65
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:48,550
What?

66
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:49,980
Doesn't I look like one?

67
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:51,350
Let me take your pulse.

68
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:53,070
No need.

69
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,160
You look

70
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,600
like a swindler.

71
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:04,260
I won't give you a hard time.

72
00:05:04,690 --> 00:05:05,450
Just tell me

73
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:07,030
how long I will live.

74
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:10,960
Eighty years old. That's for sure.

75
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:12,350
Nonsense.

76
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:14,160
I've suffered from this illness for a long time,

77
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:15,610
no one can cure it,

78
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:17,970
and it can't be cured at all.

79
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:20,150
You said you were from Chang'an?

80
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:22,570
I think you were kicked out

81
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:23,720
for swindling people.

82
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:27,700
Who told you that it was incurable?

83
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,810
Many doctors said so.

84
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,650
That's because there are no good doctors in Nanzhou.

85
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:34,960
Just like the four of you, the Nanzhou Four Scholars,

86
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:37,159
are known as renowned scholars.

87
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:39,220
But I don't think the four of you are good enough.

88
00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:40,510
How dare you!

89
00:05:40,909 --> 00:05:42,070
You're not invited for the tea.

90
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:43,180
Back off.

91
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,680
Who wants your tea?

92
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,430
It's not as good as my wine!

93
00:05:50,659 --> 00:05:51,490
Who cares about your tea?

94
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:55,210
Mr. Zhong,

95
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:57,280
this man likes to lie.

96
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:58,860
I've experienced it.

97
00:05:59,010 --> 00:05:59,520
It doesn't matter.

98
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:01,880
Everyone,

99
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:03,630
please.

100
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,340
You appear in my mind over and over again,

101
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:14,480
rejoicing over lifetime achievement.

102
00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:17,400
But I am still at a loss,

103
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:21,730
feeding on the loneliness in the wilderness.

104
00:06:23,010 --> 00:06:24,100
How unfortunate is it

105
00:06:25,170 --> 00:06:27,560
that Yuanfu and Gongfu

106
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:29,610
can't drink with us together.

107
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:33,860
Don't be sad.

108
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:35,260
Although we part in the mortal world,

109
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:36,750
the four of us

110
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:38,020
will meet in the underworld,

111
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,159
entering the bamboo forest together.

112
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:42,820
And we can drink as much as we want.

113
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:43,830
You are right.

114
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:46,350
After everyone dies,

115
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:47,850
we will still be reunited.

116
00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:50,550
We'll still be the Nanzhou Four Scholars.

117
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:04,340
Listen to his laughter,

118
00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:06,150
He's full of energy.

119
00:07:06,570 --> 00:07:08,430
He doesn't sound like a dying man.

120
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:09,590
You...

121
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,080
Mr. Zhong asked me

122
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:15,380
to provide an explanation.

123
00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:16,290
Okay.

124
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:19,320
Lu Lingfeng and I

125
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:20,520
will tell you

126
00:07:21,130 --> 00:07:24,630
what has happened in Nanzhou recently.

127
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:27,020
To be honest,

128
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:28,600
I don't want to know

129
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:30,250
about the story.

130
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,310
I just want to know

131
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:34,350
when the murderer will be arrested.

132
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:35,960
Don't worry, Prefectural Governor.

133
00:07:37,210 --> 00:07:38,710
After I finish my story,

134
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:40,500
the murderer will

135
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:43,270
show himself up

136
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:46,080
in the clouds of the Stone Bridge Mountain.

137
00:07:49,450 --> 00:07:50,680
You're acting mysteriously.

138
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:52,659
Let's hear what you have to say.

139
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,880
Mr. Leng, do you still remember

140
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,930
the Black and White Guards of the underworld

141
00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:01,130
when you were keeping vigil beside Lu Gongfu's body?

142
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:04,470
It was you that night?

143
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:06,940
Lu Lingfeng,

144
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:08,570
now you know

145
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,720
when I examined the body.

146
00:08:12,690 --> 00:08:13,180
Leng Ji,

147
00:08:13,770 --> 00:08:15,570
you tried your best to stop us from opening the coffin that day.

148
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:18,280
I was thinking of catching the murderer first

149
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:19,940
before forcing you to agree to the autopsy,

150
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:20,740
and we could eventually crack the case.

151
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,470
After arresting Lin Bao,

152
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,360
he admitted that he assassinated Lu Gongfu.

153
00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:26,650
This misled me.

154
00:08:27,030 --> 00:08:27,960
Luckily, Commander Su

155
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:29,540
examined the body carefully.

156
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:30,840
I found that

157
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:34,030
Lu Gongfu was strangled first

158
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:35,850
and then stabbed by a dagger.

159
00:08:36,169 --> 00:08:38,850
So, Lin Bao is not the culprit.

160
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:39,570
At this time,

161
00:08:40,090 --> 00:08:41,390
the most suspicious person

162
00:08:41,909 --> 00:08:42,789
is Leng Ji.

163
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:44,410
Me?

164
00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:46,360
You were the first who found the body.

165
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:48,350
You even tried your best to stop us from opening the coffin.

166
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:50,550
Shouldn't we suspect you?

167
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:52,840
If we didn't catch Tu Yanpi

168
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:53,900
when Lin Bao was arrested,

169
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:54,660
Leng,

170
00:08:54,770 --> 00:08:56,350
I'm afraid that you were still not clear from suspicions for the time being.

171
00:08:57,550 --> 00:08:58,700
My name is Tu Yanpi.

172
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:02,080
I was hired by Zhong Boqi and Lengji.

173
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:04,940
As long as I catch Lin Bao

174
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:07,260
and take him to Lu Gongfu's mourning hall

175
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,130
to both of them,

176
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:12,100
I'll get 4,000.

177
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:16,160
Next, Lu Li aroused the suspicions of

178
00:09:16,810 --> 00:09:18,360
Minister Lu.

179
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:21,590
He wanted the Stone Bridge Painting very much,

180
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:22,920
so it was very likely

181
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,080
that he would kill everyone on the painting

182
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,190
to make Ouyang Quan think

183
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:27,600
that this painting was ominous,

184
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:29,570
and make him to sell it at a low price.

185
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:31,050
Besides,

186
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,770
Lu Gongfu's guqin

187
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:34,510
was indeed stolen by him,

188
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:36,190
but he didn't have the time to kill others.

189
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:39,450
He is now in the Nanzhou Prison.

190
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:43,500
I suspected Ouyang Quan, too.

191
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:45,470
He envied renowned scholars

192
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:48,820
and wanted to be the fifth of the Nanzhou Scholars.

193
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:51,710
But as a merchant,

194
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:54,900
he was often despised by the Nanzhou Four Scholars,

195
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,630
so it was possible

196
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,050
that he had resentment.

197
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:01,340
But after the investigation,

198
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:05,350
Ouyang Quan had no time to kill, too.

199
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:08,330
When I was at a loss,

200
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:11,240
Governor Xiong helped me.

201
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:12,580
Me?

202
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:15,120
If you didn't invite me

203
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:17,100
to the banquet at the Lake Pavilion,

204
00:10:17,330 --> 00:10:20,210
and asked me to bring my sworn sister, Xijun, along,

205
00:10:21,070 --> 00:10:22,970
this case might really be

206
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:24,180
a pending case.

207
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:26,750
Miss Pei?

208
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:31,230
My sworn sister, Xijun, has been learning painting since young.

209
00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:32,760
She is especially good in human portraits.

210
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:35,050
She found that the sons of Mr. Xie

211
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:36,520
were the kids playing chess

212
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:39,250
on the Stone Bridge Painting 15 years ago,

213
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:41,310
while that old servant who committed the murder

214
00:10:41,330 --> 00:10:43,470
was also on the painting.

215
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:48,590
The people on the painting died one by one.

216
00:10:49,050 --> 00:10:50,480
That's why I suspected that

217
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:53,630
Yan Yuanfu was also murdered.

218
00:10:55,870 --> 00:10:59,080
Thank you for your trust and allowing me to open the coffin.

219
00:10:59,410 --> 00:11:01,160
During the autopsy, I found

220
00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:04,190
there was a small hole on Yuanfu's head

221
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:06,050
Between his hair buns,

222
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:08,980
I found this.

223
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:14,980
This...

224
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:18,110
Mr. Zhong,

225
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:20,370
you'd been collecting and planting tea

226
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:21,710
on the Stone Bridge Mountain.

227
00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:23,040
You know

228
00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:24,880
what this is, right?

229
00:11:29,450 --> 00:11:30,910
Let me remind you.

230
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:36,610
This is the shell of the Poison Bug.

231
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:38,770
"Ink Crazed"?

232
00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:41,990
Could it be that Yuanfu was killed

233
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:43,990
by that poisonous bug?

234
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:47,070
This bug grew in the mountains.

235
00:11:48,190 --> 00:11:49,790
Only those who collect herbs

236
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:51,330
to make exorbitant profits

237
00:11:52,130 --> 00:11:53,670
might get hurt from the bug.

238
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:57,120
Yan Yuanfu always stayed at home.

239
00:11:57,610 --> 00:11:57,910
This...

240
00:11:58,620 --> 00:11:59,680
How is that possible?

241
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:01,040
That's because someone

242
00:12:01,070 --> 00:12:03,820
bought this bug from

243
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:04,970
Mr. Huang who was collecting them

244
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:07,780
for the herbal shop.

245
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:11,330
At first, Huang thought

246
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:13,340
that he was a wandering monk.

247
00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:14,820
But in fact...

248
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,960
Brother Zhong.

249
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:29,460
What?

250
00:12:30,830 --> 00:12:32,480
Do you still need

251
00:12:32,650 --> 00:12:34,750
Lu Lingfeng to help you?

252
00:12:34,950 --> 00:12:35,370
Wait.

253
00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:12,030
Brother.

254
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:13,380
You...

255
00:13:17,890 --> 00:13:20,330
So the renowned scholar is actually bald.

256
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:25,970
Commander Su,

257
00:13:28,130 --> 00:13:29,410
how did you know

258
00:13:29,430 --> 00:13:31,210
I've lost my hair?

259
00:13:33,290 --> 00:13:34,370
That's because

260
00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:36,830
I saw your servant

261
00:13:37,170 --> 00:13:39,660
at your place

262
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:40,870
driving a girl away

263
00:13:40,890 --> 00:13:42,650
who sold combs.

264
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,130
These are homemade combs

265
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:44,980
made from the Mahogany woods,

266
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:46,350
great in repelling ghosts and demons.

267
00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:47,370
No matter how good it is, I don't want it.

268
00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:48,380
Go away.

269
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:49,340
Otherwise,

270
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:50,600
I'll be flogged.

271
00:13:50,770 --> 00:13:51,210
Go!

272
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:53,920
Then, I invited that servant

273
00:13:53,950 --> 00:13:55,750
to the Commander's residence.

274
00:13:56,490 --> 00:13:58,160
Take your time. There are plenty of them.

275
00:13:59,170 --> 00:14:00,480
Xue Huan, pour some wine.

276
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:05,550
He has never seen

277
00:14:05,690 --> 00:14:07,510
his master in bald.

278
00:14:08,090 --> 00:14:09,760
But in the last two years,

279
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:11,790
every time he cleans your bedroom,

280
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:13,230
he has often found

281
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:14,430
a lot of hair.

282
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:17,480
But no more hair was found for this half a year.

283
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,950
You were losing your hair

284
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:22,080
because you thought your illness was incurable,

285
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:24,140
and you were depressed.

286
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:25,360
Commander Su,

287
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:26,790
do you mean that

288
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:28,450
it is

289
00:14:28,930 --> 00:14:30,250
Zhong Boqi who is behind all of these?

290
00:14:31,410 --> 00:14:33,720
Yuanfu and I were old friends.

291
00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:37,250
I've visited his wife, too.

292
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:40,320
My husband is friendly and kind.

293
00:14:40,930 --> 00:14:41,990
He has no enemies.

294
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:44,510
A month before he died,

295
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:45,820
he had been compiling

296
00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:47,270
his calligraphy,

297
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:48,620
and had never been out of the house.

298
00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:51,460
Although he had stroke,

299
00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:53,730
it was just mild.

300
00:14:57,370 --> 00:14:58,450
Think about it.

301
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:00,340
Did you miss anything?

302
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:05,380
A few days before his death,

303
00:15:05,610 --> 00:15:07,160
his brother, Zhong Boqi

304
00:15:07,410 --> 00:15:08,600
came to visit him with tea.

305
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:09,570
Brother,

306
00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:12,290
I will visit you and have tea with you

307
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:14,580
after I finish the composition.

308
00:15:15,090 --> 00:15:16,090
Isn't it fine?

309
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,900
Why do you bother to come all the way here?

310
00:15:19,450 --> 00:15:20,780
You're very meticulous.

311
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:22,260
I'm afraid that it will take a whole year

312
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:23,690
for you to get your composition done.

313
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:25,980
Brother,

314
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:27,420
do you feel bad for me?

315
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:29,520
That's why you don't want me to bring my tea set

316
00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:30,740
to your place to make tea for you.

317
00:15:30,850 --> 00:15:32,140
Thank you for your kindness.

318
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:33,290
To be honest,

319
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:35,210
I miss your tea

320
00:15:35,830 --> 00:15:37,450
so much.

321
00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:39,400
Mr. Zhong is really good at the tea ceremony.

322
00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:40,780
You deserve your reputation.

323
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:42,880
Even these bottles

324
00:15:43,010 --> 00:15:44,400
are so beautiful.

325
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:46,580
Excuse my poor skill, sister-in-law.

326
00:15:47,930 --> 00:15:49,660
Although I don't know much about tea,

327
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:52,610
I still know that the tea set should be

328
00:15:52,650 --> 00:15:53,700
simple and natural.

329
00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:55,410
I've never heard of

330
00:15:55,530 --> 00:15:57,980
people using such luxurious containers like glass bottles.

331
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:00,640
The shopkeeper told me something

332
00:16:01,030 --> 00:16:02,900
at the herbal shop that day.

333
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:04,880
There's something you don't know.

334
00:16:05,530 --> 00:16:07,740
The glaze of the glass is the best for restraining this bug.

335
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:11,060
It will feel dizzy after entering the glass bottle.

336
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:12,420
Otherwise,

337
00:16:12,850 --> 00:16:14,470
once it crawls into our seven apertures,

338
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:15,010
we...

339
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:17,810
we'll die.

340
00:16:17,930 --> 00:16:19,530
Yan Yuanfu is a master of calligraphy,

341
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:21,870
and of course he has scent of ink on him.

342
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,870
This poisonous bug is locally known as "Ink Crazed".

343
00:16:26,050 --> 00:16:27,290
As long as Zhong Boqi sought a chance

344
00:16:27,330 --> 00:16:28,230
to release it,

345
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:29,700
then the victim

346
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:31,470
must be Yan Yuanfu.

347
00:16:32,330 --> 00:16:32,900
Brother,

348
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,040
I've never seen you

349
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:36,450
using a glass bottle

350
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:37,370
to make tea.

351
00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:39,750
Is what they said true?

352
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,080
Someone witnessed Lu Gongfu's death.

353
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:45,770
It was a beggar

354
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:46,790
who often received help from him.

355
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:47,820
The beggar said

356
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:50,550
he only saw the back of the murderer.

357
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:51,780
Because of the cover,

358
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,470
what he saw

359
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:57,240
was a bald man.

360
00:16:57,830 --> 00:17:00,270
The day when Lu Gongfu was mourning

361
00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:03,260
in front of Yan Yuanfu's grave,

362
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:05,050
the strings of his guqin were even broke due to his sadness.

363
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:07,790
But when Lu Li stole the guqin,

364
00:17:08,050 --> 00:17:10,140
the strings had been fixed.

365
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:13,150
If I'm not mistaken,

366
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:14,569
the strings came

367
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:17,410
from you, right?

368
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:22,109
But this time, the showing of your baldness

369
00:17:22,130 --> 00:17:23,869
wasn't intentional.

370
00:17:24,130 --> 00:17:27,470
I think you tried too hard when you were murdering,

371
00:17:28,069 --> 00:17:29,430
and dropped your

372
00:17:30,210 --> 00:17:33,170
nicely combed wig.

373
00:17:35,610 --> 00:17:36,370
Zhong Boqi,

374
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:39,220
say something.

375
00:17:47,870 --> 00:17:48,450
Brother,

376
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:50,420
look what I've brought to you.

377
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:54,470
These are some great guqin strings.

378
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:00,710
You are so considerate.

379
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:01,740
It won't ruin

380
00:18:01,770 --> 00:18:03,100
your reputation as the Master of Guqin.

381
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:04,710
Okay.

382
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:05,280
Change the strings.

383
00:18:11,850 --> 00:18:12,950
I'm tired of walking.

384
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,110
When you've changed the strings,

385
00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:23,210
I would like you to play a song.

386
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:28,810
Sure.

387
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:39,960
[Lu's Residence]

388
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:39,740
Brother,

389
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,770
just tell me

390
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:47,820
that what they said is not true.

391
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,650
I will only trust you.

392
00:19:51,910 --> 00:19:52,620
Brother,

393
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:57,420
I cared too much about you.

394
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:00,390
That's why I did that.

395
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,050
-Zhong Boqi. -Brother.

396
00:20:04,010 --> 00:20:06,300
Are you really the one behind all of this?

397
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:08,500
Unbelievable.

398
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:11,530
Don't you Nanzhou Four Scholars

399
00:20:11,870 --> 00:20:13,450
have strong bonds,

400
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:15,240
and are as close as blood brothers?

401
00:20:15,790 --> 00:20:17,820
What was this all about?

402
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:21,560
He thinks that he's terminally ill.

403
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:22,490
So,

404
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:24,430
he wanted to take the other three

405
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:26,100
to the underworld together with him.

406
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:27,980
This relationship is toxic.

407
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:29,990
How selfish!

408
00:20:30,470 --> 00:20:31,500
How arrogant!

409
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:33,640
How cruel!

410
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:35,050
Why did you have to kill

411
00:20:35,090 --> 00:20:36,540
everyone on the Stone Bridge Painting,

412
00:20:36,990 --> 00:20:38,320
from the woodcutter to the kids,

413
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:40,400
and even the old servant?

414
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:46,180
The woodcutter.

415
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:48,690
When we found the woodcutter,

416
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:49,860
he seemed like having a sudden illness

417
00:20:49,890 --> 00:20:50,650
and fell off the cliff.

418
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:51,950
He was in severe pain.

419
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:53,220
What did you do to him?

420
00:20:53,670 --> 00:20:55,130
I just gave him

421
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:56,250
a new clothing.

422
00:20:56,810 --> 00:20:57,430
It was black,

423
00:20:58,350 --> 00:20:59,670
and was soaked in ink.

424
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:00,770
In addition,

425
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:02,710
there was another poison bug on it.

426
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:03,780
Yes.

427
00:21:04,910 --> 00:21:06,110
Let's talk about

428
00:21:06,770 --> 00:21:08,600
the old servant of the Xie family.

429
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:12,750
He sought his own death.

430
00:21:13,450 --> 00:21:15,380
Master Xie asked him to send me the invitation,

431
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:17,330
and I invited him in for a cup of tea.

432
00:21:18,390 --> 00:21:19,130
But,

433
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:21,300
I ignited the anger to revenge

434
00:21:21,330 --> 00:21:22,670
in his heart.

435
00:21:23,870 --> 00:21:24,850
These people

436
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,200
seem insignificant.

437
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:30,080
It looks like they are just embellishment

438
00:21:30,110 --> 00:21:31,140
on the painting.

439
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:34,110
But without them,

440
00:21:35,410 --> 00:21:36,960
this painting would not be perfect.

441
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:38,860
Not perfect!

442
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:41,660
Zhong Boqi,

443
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:43,640
are you crazy?

444
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:45,850
You're crazy!

445
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:48,370
Aren't you afraid

446
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:50,380
that Yuanfu and Gongfu will take revenge on you

447
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,800
in the underworld?

448
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:53,490
Brother,

449
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:57,260
I'm terminally ill.

450
00:21:57,290 --> 00:21:59,600
I can only live for three months at most.

451
00:22:00,590 --> 00:22:01,460
After I die,

452
00:22:01,930 --> 00:22:03,970
we'll be separated by life and death.

453
00:22:05,010 --> 00:22:06,420
I can't stand it alone in the underworld,

454
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:07,780
and you can't stand losing me

455
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:09,300
in the mortal world too.

456
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:10,680
That is why I've decided

457
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:11,670
to take all of you

458
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:13,020
together with me.

459
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:14,770
We, Nanzhou Four Scholars

460
00:22:16,230 --> 00:22:17,890
will be companions in the afterlife.

461
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:20,550
We can listen to the guqin together,

462
00:22:21,290 --> 00:22:22,470
and have some tea.

463
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:23,820
Shut up!

464
00:22:24,550 --> 00:22:25,680
You're so scary.

465
00:22:27,270 --> 00:22:27,810
I...

466
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:30,240
I can grant your wish.

467
00:22:31,690 --> 00:22:32,580
But I'm not dying

468
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,510
to follow you.

469
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:39,450
Instead, I hate myself for being blind

470
00:22:40,210 --> 00:22:41,670
to befriend someone like you.

471
00:22:44,850 --> 00:22:47,870
I'm too ashamed to live any longer.

472
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,400
Brother,

473
00:22:53,610 --> 00:22:55,170
you don't have to act like this!

474
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:58,680
You and I are both renowned scholars.

475
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:00,680
Even if we die,

476
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:02,930
we should die gracefully.

477
00:23:03,850 --> 00:23:05,430
I've made a plan for you.

478
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:07,670
I've already applied the chronic poison

479
00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:09,580
on the bottom of the tea bowl

480
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:11,310
that you used just now.

481
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:15,170
Brother.

482
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:18,730
Brother.

483
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:22,520
You are the youngest among the Nanzhou Four Scholars.

484
00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:25,940
I care for you the most,

485
00:23:26,710 --> 00:23:28,360
so I won't make you suffer too much.

486
00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:30,740
When you die later,

487
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:33,680
it will be like the dusk

488
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:35,970
falling gradually.

489
00:23:37,070 --> 00:23:38,110
You will see

490
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:40,860
a beautiful scene.

491
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:47,520
Brother Su, I...

492
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:50,260
No need to worry.

493
00:23:50,870 --> 00:23:53,620
He didn't mean to take you away.

494
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,320
That's right.

495
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:56,990
You don't deserve it.

496
00:23:58,460 --> 00:24:00,540
You are just a Prefectural Governor and an Administrator.

497
00:24:01,250 --> 00:24:02,560
Making friends with us, the Nanzhou Four Scholars,

498
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:04,180
is just to follow us and act like you were cultured.

499
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:05,820
But in my eyes,

500
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:06,760
you are not even on a par

501
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:08,240
with the grass or trees on the painting of the Stong Bridge.

502
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:10,030
Su Wuming.

503
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:11,510
Detective Di's disciple.

504
00:24:12,190 --> 00:24:13,290
You deserve your reputation.

505
00:24:15,110 --> 00:24:15,790
Lu Lingfeng,

506
00:24:16,410 --> 00:24:17,720
you were once a member of the Imperial Guards,

507
00:24:18,570 --> 00:24:19,590
who had protected His Majesty.

508
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,730
You are also well-trained.

509
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,380
But gentlemen,

510
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:27,770
I, Zhong Boqi,

511
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:30,300
have accomplished my task.

512
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:33,400
You can't do anything to me, can you?

513
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,200
The fairyland of the Stone Bridge is beautiful,

514
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:46,380
but people are too evil.

515
00:24:47,090 --> 00:24:48,630
If I hadn't exchanged you two's tea bowl

516
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:50,140
when you

517
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,450
went to greet Leng Ji,

518
00:24:53,410 --> 00:24:55,700
you would've really succeeded.

519
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:06,190
Brother Su...

520
00:25:20,110 --> 00:25:22,240
I finally understand

521
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:24,350
why you did that.

522
00:25:25,310 --> 00:25:25,960
You

523
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:28,600
saved my life.

524
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:35,970
I slept just now.

525
00:25:37,110 --> 00:25:38,470
What are you talking about?

526
00:25:42,550 --> 00:25:44,270
Zhong Boqi,

527
00:25:44,770 --> 00:25:46,910
you're not terminally ill.

528
00:25:48,090 --> 00:25:49,560
It's just because Nanzhou is remote,

529
00:25:49,630 --> 00:25:50,890
and you are misdiagnosed by a quack.

530
00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:52,250
To be honest,

531
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:55,300
I've been pretending to be a physician

532
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:58,580
in Nanzhou's largest medicine shop for several days.

533
00:25:59,130 --> 00:26:00,490
I've seen more than ten patients

534
00:26:00,630 --> 00:26:01,890
like you.

535
00:26:02,210 --> 00:26:04,170
I promise I can cure

536
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:05,650
your hemoptysis.

537
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:15,890
The painting is done.

538
00:26:16,430 --> 00:26:17,980
My lady has drawn

539
00:26:18,010 --> 00:26:19,000
the scenery today.

540
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:23,250
Look.

541
00:26:36,390 --> 00:26:38,310
So the murderer is Zhong Boqi.

542
00:26:38,730 --> 00:26:40,220
He really killed so many people.

543
00:26:41,110 --> 00:26:42,890
Is this a so-called renowned scholar?

544
00:26:44,150 --> 00:26:46,600
It seems that there will be no scholar in Nanzhou anymore.

545
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:48,100
Yes. Who could expect that?

546
00:26:48,210 --> 00:26:49,650
You can't judge a book by its cover.

547
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:52,820
Zhong Boqi

548
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:55,190
killed so many innocent people for no reason.

549
00:26:55,650 --> 00:26:56,960
It is even a blessing for him

550
00:26:57,070 --> 00:26:58,350
to be decapitated just for once.

551
00:27:00,170 --> 00:27:01,930
But Ouyang Quan

552
00:27:02,070 --> 00:27:03,680
tore the notice.

553
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:05,600
I suspect

554
00:27:06,090 --> 00:27:07,030
that he has hysteria.

555
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,090
-What? -What?

556
00:27:09,350 --> 00:27:11,190
Ouyang Quan tore the notice.

557
00:27:11,330 --> 00:27:12,500
When did this happen?

558
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:13,710
Just now.

559
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:15,500
He yelled

560
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:17,110
that no one was allowed

561
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:18,530
to ruin the reputation of

562
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:19,630
the Nanzhou Four Scholars.

563
00:27:20,870 --> 00:27:22,070
I've sent someone

564
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:23,430
to escort him home

565
00:27:23,690 --> 00:27:26,230
and had his family watch him closely.

566
00:27:27,930 --> 00:27:28,500
Oh no.

567
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:52,540
Let go of me!

568
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:53,390
Ouyang Quan.

569
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:54,660
Are you crazy, too?

570
00:27:55,010 --> 00:27:56,620
Why do you stop me?

571
00:27:56,650 --> 00:27:58,670
Why?

572
00:27:58,780 --> 00:28:00,140
Shouldn't you

573
00:28:00,390 --> 00:28:01,500
help me

574
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:03,110
form a new Four Scholars

575
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:04,780
with Zhong Boqi, Yan Yuanfu

576
00:28:04,810 --> 00:28:05,750
and Lu Gongfu

577
00:28:05,870 --> 00:28:08,700
in the underworld?

578
00:28:08,990 --> 00:28:11,480
Do you think only by doing this

579
00:28:11,510 --> 00:28:13,150
can you become a renowned scholar?

580
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:14,550
What else can I do?

581
00:28:15,390 --> 00:28:16,830
I'm a businessman.

582
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:18,850
Even if I have a fortune of a trillion,

583
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:21,460
people will still look down on me.

584
00:28:22,350 --> 00:28:23,870
Let go of me!

585
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:28,640
Ouyang Quan.

586
00:28:29,210 --> 00:28:30,220
Have you ever thought

587
00:28:30,410 --> 00:28:31,690
what a renowned scholar is?

588
00:28:32,030 --> 00:28:33,030
All these years,

589
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:33,870
in Nanzhou

590
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:34,880
your kindness has been witnessed by all.

591
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:36,410
Many unsuccessful young men

592
00:28:36,630 --> 00:28:37,530
have earned a living

593
00:28:37,770 --> 00:28:39,090
in your restaurant or tavern.

594
00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:40,980
Whether there's a crop failure or not,

595
00:28:41,350 --> 00:28:42,980
you will open your own granary

596
00:28:43,090 --> 00:28:44,360
at New Year's Eve

597
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:46,020
and distribute rice

598
00:28:46,050 --> 00:28:47,110
to the poor in the city.

599
00:28:48,510 --> 00:28:49,800
How did you know?

600
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:51,180
To investigate the case,

601
00:28:51,550 --> 00:28:53,030
don't I need to listen to the public opinion?

602
00:28:53,290 --> 00:28:53,910
Yes.

603
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:55,930
The people of Nanzhou

604
00:28:56,070 --> 00:28:56,870
remember everything you did

605
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:58,380
in their heart.

606
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:00,450
And what you did

607
00:29:00,470 --> 00:29:02,600
shows that you are indeed a person with nobility.

608
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:04,400
In my eyes,

609
00:29:05,090 --> 00:29:06,680
you deserve the reputation of a scholar

610
00:29:07,590 --> 00:29:08,650
more than those people on the painting of the Stone Bridge.

611
00:29:26,370 --> 00:29:26,960
You...

612
00:29:28,170 --> 00:29:30,690
You trick me!

613
00:29:35,590 --> 00:29:36,380
Renowned scholars

614
00:29:36,670 --> 00:29:38,630
are not interpreted by their behaviors,

615
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:39,860
but more importantly,

616
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:42,320
by their compassion.

617
00:29:42,710 --> 00:29:43,470
In Nanzhou,

618
00:29:43,790 --> 00:29:46,190
if you, Ouyang Quan, are not a noble man,

619
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:48,390
who dares to be called like this?

620
00:29:50,090 --> 00:29:51,660
As for the Stone Bridge Painting,

621
00:29:51,950 --> 00:29:54,560
Lu Li is willing to return it at the original price.

622
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:56,290
My sworn sister, Xi Jun, is willing to

623
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:58,110
add you on this painting.

624
00:29:59,080 --> 00:29:59,910
Ouyang Quan,

625
00:30:00,530 --> 00:30:03,660
there's so much more in the world

626
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:04,530
for you to do.

627
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:06,370
What worth pursuing

628
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:08,660
is not just fame.

629
00:30:13,050 --> 00:30:13,730
Ouyang Quan,

630
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:15,900
Commander Su and I

631
00:30:16,350 --> 00:30:17,550
are willing to be friends with you.

632
00:30:18,610 --> 00:30:20,090
Later, we may enter the bamboo forest together,

633
00:30:20,390 --> 00:30:21,430
and follow the Seven Sages

634
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:22,460
to drink your fill.

635
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:23,460
Isn't it OK?

636
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:26,140
Count Mr. Fed in.

637
00:30:26,370 --> 00:30:27,330
He loves drinking the most,

638
00:30:27,890 --> 00:30:30,420
and he appreciates you a lot too.

639
00:30:32,150 --> 00:30:32,630
By the way,

640
00:30:33,410 --> 00:30:35,620
the prescription for coughing he made

641
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:38,370
has been proved useful.

642
00:30:39,250 --> 00:30:40,000
But

643
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:42,240
the herbs are a bit expensive.

644
00:30:42,550 --> 00:30:43,840
Many poor people

645
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:45,260
in Nanzhou

646
00:30:45,890 --> 00:30:47,050
can't afford it.

647
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:49,500
I'm willing to do my best to help.

648
00:30:53,270 --> 00:30:56,000
You're a true renowned scholar.

649
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:08,890
I haven't seen you cough in a long time

650
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:12,020
since I came here.

651
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,480
After a few doses of medicine,

652
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:19,380
I really stopped coughing.

653
00:32:20,210 --> 00:32:22,120
I've written a letter to Governor Xiong.

654
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:23,700
I'm willing to donate all my assets

655
00:32:24,230 --> 00:32:27,460
to afford the medicine

656
00:32:29,450 --> 00:32:30,520
for people who have the same disease in Nanzhou.

657
00:32:31,370 --> 00:32:32,580
You want to atone

658
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:34,930
for your own life?

659
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:39,560
I don't dare to die,

660
00:32:42,370 --> 00:32:43,560
nor do I dare to live.

661
00:32:46,650 --> 00:32:47,600
I'm afraid

662
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:49,090
that Yuanfu, Gongfu

663
00:32:50,010 --> 00:32:51,110
and other people

664
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:54,840
may come after me in the underworld.

665
00:33:02,150 --> 00:33:03,770
Between the Heaven and the Earth,

666
00:33:06,250 --> 00:33:08,240
and between the human and the ghost,

667
00:33:10,510 --> 00:33:11,560
where is

668
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:14,170
my final destination?

669
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:39,320
You must pay attention to the details.

670
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:41,580
The details

671
00:33:41,690 --> 00:33:42,810
are the key point.

672
00:34:11,210 --> 00:34:13,150
What's wrong? Have you found a new clue?

673
00:34:13,540 --> 00:34:14,790
No. Come out.

674
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:19,010
Gantang Post.

675
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:20,900
We missed too many clues there.

676
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:23,469
Something's wrong with Liu Shiba.

677
00:34:27,070 --> 00:34:30,909
[Nanzhou]

678
00:34:28,370 --> 00:34:29,300
Governor Xiong.

679
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:31,670
When I first arrived in Nanzhou,

680
00:34:32,270 --> 00:34:33,920
I remember you told me

681
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:35,540
you would give me one month off

682
00:34:35,570 --> 00:34:36,870
to have a good rest.

683
00:34:37,750 --> 00:34:38,900
Does it still count?

684
00:34:40,170 --> 00:34:41,730
Yes. I still remember that.

685
00:34:41,969 --> 00:34:42,969
Brother Su and Brother Lu.

686
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,270
You must be tired these days.

687
00:34:44,610 --> 00:34:46,370
You should take a good rest.

688
00:34:47,570 --> 00:34:48,659
One month,

689
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:49,719
is it enough?

690
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:52,290
Yes.

691
00:34:52,670 --> 00:34:53,620
But Commander Su and I

692
00:34:53,830 --> 00:34:54,760
need to leave Nanzhou.

693
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:57,990
Is it because the capital city...

694
00:34:58,190 --> 00:34:59,680
Governor Xiong has misunderstood.

695
00:35:00,010 --> 00:35:01,310
It has nothing to do with the capital.

696
00:35:01,770 --> 00:35:02,370
Here's the thing.

697
00:35:02,690 --> 00:35:04,030
When we went to the south,

698
00:35:04,130 --> 00:35:05,380
we passed by a place

699
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:06,820
called Gantang Post,

700
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:08,260
and we stayed there.

701
00:35:08,770 --> 00:35:10,430
Something strange happened

702
00:35:10,450 --> 00:35:11,810
during that period.

703
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:15,240
They haven't been solved yet.

704
00:35:15,810 --> 00:35:19,340
We want to go back and find out the truth.

705
00:35:19,910 --> 00:35:20,970
Gantang Post?

706
00:35:21,690 --> 00:35:22,570
Is it

707
00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:25,090
the post in Gantang County?

708
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:25,930
Yes.

709
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:29,780
Wang Nailing, the Magistrate of Gantang,

710
00:35:30,090 --> 00:35:30,950
was my classmate.

711
00:35:31,190 --> 00:35:33,070
He is upright and diligent.

712
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:34,380
People in Gantang put their faith in him.

713
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:36,170
I can write him a letter.

714
00:35:36,830 --> 00:35:37,860
If anything happens,

715
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:39,820
he will help you.

716
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:44,970
-Thank you, Governor Xiong. -Thank you, Governor Xiong.

717
00:35:47,630 --> 00:35:48,290
Xijun,

718
00:35:49,010 --> 00:35:50,660
give me an idea.

719
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:53,100
Tell me how I can change my appearance

720
00:35:53,130 --> 00:35:54,950
to make people who have seen me

721
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:56,090
unable to recognize me.

722
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:57,480
Shave your beard.

723
00:36:00,590 --> 00:36:01,470
No.

724
00:36:01,890 --> 00:36:02,700
I think it's good.

725
00:36:03,820 --> 00:36:05,060
You're not old

726
00:36:05,340 --> 00:36:06,820
but you pretend to be an old master all day.

727
00:36:07,430 --> 00:36:08,520
Shave your beard,

728
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:09,700
then no one would

729
00:36:10,050 --> 00:36:11,960
recognize you.

730
00:36:12,330 --> 00:36:12,800
But I...

731
00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:14,380
Miss Pei, what about me?

732
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:18,010
Wear a fake beard.

733
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:21,460
Where can I find it?

734
00:36:22,860 --> 00:36:24,240
General Lu, just tell me

735
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:25,930
what kind of beard you like.

736
00:36:28,090 --> 00:36:28,770
Come with me.

737
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:30,250
Freeze!

738
00:36:31,370 --> 00:36:31,990
This one.

739
00:36:33,980 --> 00:36:35,670
No problem. I promise

740
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:36,620
I will make one

741
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:37,420
same as that of Mr Xie.

742
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:39,730
What?

743
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:42,230
You don't need to know.

744
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:48,830
Is there no other way?

745
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:51,090
It's only been a month

746
00:36:51,190 --> 00:36:52,550
since you had an adventurous journey in the Gantang Post.

747
00:36:53,010 --> 00:36:54,730
If you don't shave your beard,

748
00:36:54,750 --> 00:36:56,180
even if you have all your hair cut,

749
00:36:56,220 --> 00:36:57,830
they'll recognize you.

750
00:36:58,710 --> 00:37:00,550
And we don't know how to

751
00:37:00,860 --> 00:37:01,850
disguise ourselves like Yin Shilang.

752
00:37:04,820 --> 00:37:05,530
That makes sense.

753
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:08,850
We can't catch the ghost,

754
00:37:09,730 --> 00:37:10,770
if I am reluctant to shave my beard.

755
00:37:12,890 --> 00:37:14,040
I'll listen to you.

756
00:37:38,470 --> 00:37:40,560
My sworn sister is skillful

757
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:42,120
in not only the painting,

758
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:44,260
but also disguising.

759
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:45,530
Amazing.

760
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:48,870
I'll enter the Gantang Post

761
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:49,940
alone first.

762
00:37:50,150 --> 00:37:51,420
You shall enter in four hours.

763
00:37:51,980 --> 00:37:52,580
No.

764
00:37:52,910 --> 00:37:53,770
You're a scholar.

765
00:37:54,070 --> 00:37:55,040
Four hours?

766
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:57,280
Your head would have been in the pot.

767
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:10,710
[Gantang Post]

768
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:38,410
Who are you?

769
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:40,720
You knocked on my door

770
00:38:40,890 --> 00:38:42,140
but you asked me who I am.

771
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:44,620
Tell me your name.

772
00:38:45,750 --> 00:38:47,560
I'm Liu Shiba.

773
00:38:50,380 --> 00:38:52,330
I'm heading north to assume office.

774
00:38:53,060 --> 00:38:54,750
Since it is going to rain heavily,

775
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:56,300
I would like to stay here for a night.

776
00:38:57,420 --> 00:38:58,860
Not available.

777
00:38:59,140 --> 00:38:59,670
Why?

778
00:39:00,330 --> 00:39:01,090
There is "Gantang Post"

779
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:02,540
on the plaque.

780
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:04,320
It must be an official post.

781
00:39:05,180 --> 00:39:06,740
This place has been abandoned.

782
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:08,580
The new post is ten miles away.

783
00:39:08,860 --> 00:39:11,020
Why don't you stay there?

784
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:13,250
An abandoned post?

785
00:39:13,650 --> 00:39:14,930
Then why do you live here?

786
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:16,650
Judging from your clothing,

787
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:18,180
you are undoubtedly a corvee working here.

788
00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:19,930
Why are you refusing me?

789
00:39:20,450 --> 00:39:21,830
Eight years ago,

790
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:23,280
I worked here as a corvee.

791
00:39:23,730 --> 00:39:25,350
But it was abandoned three years ago.

792
00:39:25,690 --> 00:39:26,860
I had nowhere to go.

793
00:39:27,130 --> 00:39:28,270
So I take here as my home.

794
00:39:29,340 --> 00:39:30,160
Can't I?

795
00:39:37,820 --> 00:39:39,560
It's going to rain heavily soon,

796
00:39:40,190 --> 00:39:40,900
and you don't let me in?

797
00:39:41,890 --> 00:39:42,830
Whether it's abandoned or not,

798
00:39:43,130 --> 00:39:44,480
it is the government's place.

799
00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:47,150
I will cane you if you don't let me in.

800
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:48,680
Your Honor,

801
00:39:48,770 --> 00:39:50,130
don't be angry.

802
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:51,630
There's another reason

803
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:52,910
that I can't let you in.

804
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:54,300
Because this place

805
00:39:54,950 --> 00:39:55,830
is haunted.

806
00:40:02,180 --> 00:40:03,300
Why is it haunted?

807
00:40:04,130 --> 00:40:05,420
You Honor must be knowledgeable.

808
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:07,150
You must have understood

809
00:40:07,180 --> 00:40:07,980
what I mean immediately.

810
00:40:13,970 --> 00:40:15,330
It's going to rain heavily,

811
00:40:15,750 --> 00:40:17,070
and it's getting dark soon.

812
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:22,310
Since you are living here,

813
00:40:22,530 --> 00:40:23,610
you must have your ways

814
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:25,940
to avoid dangers.

815
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:28,060
It's not appropriate.

816
00:40:29,710 --> 00:40:31,000
Don't be shy.

817
00:40:51,470 --> 00:40:52,110
Liu Shiba.

818
00:40:52,390 --> 00:40:54,080
Get me some wine,

819
00:40:54,270 --> 00:40:54,990
and one chicken.

820
00:40:56,100 --> 00:40:56,920
So sorry for that.

821
00:40:57,190 --> 00:40:58,310
The weasels bit all the chicken

822
00:40:58,500 --> 00:40:59,870
to death two days ago.

823
00:41:01,270 --> 00:41:03,070
But I've cooked some meat.

824
00:41:03,330 --> 00:41:04,120
It smells good.

825
00:41:33,340 --> 00:41:34,070
Liu Shiba.

826
00:41:34,750 --> 00:41:35,920
It is my personal habit

827
00:41:36,230 --> 00:41:37,470
that I only like chicken since young.

828
00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:38,930
If there's not,

829
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:41,480
I can only eat vegetables to satisfy my hunger.

830
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:43,100
Vegetables?

831
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:47,300
I wonder if wild vegetables are counted.

832
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:49,260
I'll cook some rice and wild vegetable balls for you.

833
00:41:49,370 --> 00:41:50,780
Is that fine?

834
00:42:00,580 --> 00:42:01,350
Fine.

835
00:42:12,740 --> 00:42:13,470
I didn't cook it well.

836
00:42:14,020 --> 00:42:16,650
I wonder if you like it.

837
00:42:22,770 --> 00:42:23,650
It tastes good.

838
00:42:24,610 --> 00:42:25,930
I'm glad that you like it.

839
00:42:26,890 --> 00:42:27,830
Do you want to join me?

840
00:42:28,770 --> 00:42:29,220
No.

841
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:31,190
I'm used to eating meat.

842
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:33,320
I still think the meat tastes better.

843
00:42:35,450 --> 00:42:36,530
In such wilderness,

844
00:42:37,090 --> 00:42:38,190
there's not even chicken here.

845
00:42:38,610 --> 00:42:39,900
What meat are you eating?

846
00:42:41,740 --> 00:42:42,540
Mountain monkeys.

847
00:42:42,950 --> 00:42:43,410
What?

848
00:42:45,550 --> 00:42:47,220
The mountain behind the Post

849
00:42:47,460 --> 00:42:48,580
has a span of a hundred miles away.

850
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:50,000
There is a kind of beast in the mountain

851
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:51,280
called Mountain Monkey.

852
00:42:51,610 --> 00:42:52,940
They often come to harass me.

853
00:42:53,410 --> 00:42:54,530
So I set up some traps

854
00:42:54,730 --> 00:42:56,020
at the foot of the mountain.

855
00:42:56,460 --> 00:42:57,110
Once I catch one,

856
00:42:57,490 --> 00:42:58,480
I'll cook it for meal.

857
00:42:59,250 --> 00:43:01,920
Are the beasts in the shape of humans?

858
00:43:16,380 --> 00:43:20,480
♫The storm rises with no reason♫

859
00:43:21,190 --> 00:43:23,560

♫With the darkness rising♫

864
00:43:41,370 --> 00:43:47,030
♫I can't stop wandering through the night♫

865
00:43:47,780 --> 00:43:53,970
♫With light in my heart, I'm not afraid of the storm♫

866
00:43:54,300 --> 00:43:58,010
♫It's because of justice♫

867
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:06,630
♫That I seek a truth for this long, lonely night♫

868
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:13,340
♫The heaven and earth are held together by a strong will♫

869
00:44:14,340 --> 00:44:16,130
♫The people are in peace♫

870
00:44:16,350 --> 00:44:20,500
♫Carving right and wrong into a clear heart♫

871
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:22,180
♫The truth♫

872
00:44:22,730 --> 00:44:25,800
♫Will reinterpret this justice♫

873
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:31,960
♫Even if there is a fog♫

874
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:34,950
♫Even if there are invisible waves♫

875
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:38,550
♫I'll tell the story of the fate♫

876
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:45,070
♫Tell the love of the world♫

877
00:44:46,360 --> 00:44:48,560
♫For the memory of grace♫

878
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:51,860
♫And the resentment is not yet over♫

879
00:44:52,850 --> 00:44:58,280
♫The rivers and mountains are immortal, the clouds are overturned♫

880
00:44:59,220 --> 00:45:05,420
♫To be consoled by the truth, even with thorns on my back♫

881
00:45:05,740 --> 00:45:10,140
♫Only for justice♫

882
00:45:12,110 --> 00:45:18,390
♫That I seek a truth for this long, lonely night♫

883
00:45:18,660 --> 00:45:24,560
♫The heaven and earth are held together by a strong will♫

884
00:45:25,590 --> 00:45:27,650
♫The people are in peace♫

885
00:45:27,670 --> 00:45:32,110
♫Carving right and wrong into a clear heart♫

886
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:34,220
♫The truth♫

887
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:37,970
♫Will reinterpret this justice♫

888
00:45:38,210 --> 00:45:44,320
♫Even if there are a thousand sails, it's not a waste of time♫

889
00:45:44,690 --> 00:45:50,870
♫What I am afraid of is the unrighted wrong♫

890
00:45:51,490 --> 00:45:53,400
♫What is the meaning of life and death?♫

891
00:45:53,620 --> 00:45:57,760
♫I'll paint the sunshine into the landscape♫

892
00:45:58,080 --> 00:45:59,790
♫The spirit of righteousness♫

893
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,410
♫Exists for the one I care♫
