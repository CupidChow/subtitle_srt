4
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:47,960
Fed!

5
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:51,300
Rack your brains! Think of some way to defeat that beast!

6
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:52,610
That drunkard knows nothing.

7
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,130
Tianzhu Incense is its favorite.

8
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:58,300
The scent of it can quickly lull it to sleep.

9
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,240
Go find it.

10
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,040
Where are we going

11
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:01,060
to find that thing now?

12
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:03,720
Tianzhu Incense.

13
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:05,490
Tianzhu Incense.

14
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:08,419
We can surely find it near the alligator statue.

15
00:02:11,009 --> 00:02:11,810
I'll go.

16
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:30,560
Yes!

17
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:32,060
That's it!

18
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:17,650
Luckily, you

19
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:19,500
found the back door of Goodwill House.

20
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:20,740
That was close.

21
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:23,520
He Xi.

22
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:25,440
You've planted a spy in the Worshippers of Tuo God?

23
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:28,780
Yeah. I've been the Minister of Justice

24
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:30,260
of Ninghu for years after all.

25
00:03:30,329 --> 00:03:31,370
They planted spies

26
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:32,810
around you too.

27
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:38,240
This was found

28
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,400
on the body of Officer Ma.

29
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:41,579
He'd been reporting everything

30
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,890
to the Worshippers of Tuo God.

31
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:47,490
What made you suspect him?

32
00:03:51,170 --> 00:03:53,140
Judging from his reaction,

33
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:54,980
he wasn't

34
00:03:55,010 --> 00:03:56,130
going to get Prefectural Governor Li back,

35
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:59,820
but was going to kill him.

36
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:02,150
He was beside me for many years.

37
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:04,170
Who would have known he was a spy?

38
00:04:04,850 --> 00:04:05,900
I had never suspected him.

39
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,300
It's hair-raising thinking about it.

40
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,430
That Officer Ma ended up

41
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:13,170
being shot to death by the Worshippers.

42
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:14,680
It served him right!

43
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:20,450
Seems that the Worshippers of Tuo God

44
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,560
are determined to kill us.

45
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:27,470
If that's the case,

46
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:30,000
Xijun and Xue Huan might be in danger.

47
00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:54,210
Miss!

48
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:26,820
Xijun!

49
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:28,230
Xue Huan!

50
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,010
Xue Huan!

51
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:34,650
Are you okay?

52
00:05:39,659 --> 00:05:40,730
Thank you for saving me.

53
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:43,950
Is she

54
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:45,770
the one in the Temple of Tuo God?

55
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,080
It's you.

56
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:49,500
Her name is Yingtao.

57
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:51,550
She's Prefectural Governor Li's daughter.

58
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:52,960
Surprised?

59
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,020
Brother,

60
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:55,500
General,

61
00:05:56,330 --> 00:05:57,750
may I have a word with you?

62
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:01,090
Minister He.

63
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:01,880
Yeah.

64
00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:02,930
Please

65
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:04,350
keep Miss Yingtao safe.

66
00:06:16,890 --> 00:06:17,650
She can't be

67
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:18,650
Li Yu's daughter.

68
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:19,970
Do you have any proof?

69
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:21,230
I don't need proof.

70
00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:22,960
Three years ago in Chang'an,

71
00:06:23,130 --> 00:06:24,250
I met Li Yu once.

72
00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:25,750
He was in his early thirties.

73
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:26,880
How's it possible

74
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:27,840
that he had a daughter this old?

75
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:30,140
Are you sure the man you met

76
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:31,870
was Li Yu who was about to take office in Ninghu?

77
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:32,880
He could be someone else.

78
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:34,140
My father told me

79
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:35,900
Li Yu didn't become an official through the imperial exams.

80
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:38,400
Instead, he was an informal official who bought his post.

81
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:40,540
An informal official?

82
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:42,530
You've heard of that before, right?

83
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:45,120
When Queen Wei was in power,

84
00:06:45,409 --> 00:06:46,770
informal officials came into being.

85
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:48,090
Anyone could get a government post

86
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:49,210
as long as they have money.

87
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:51,500
It resulted in a bunch of useless,

88
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:52,780
and even corrupt officials.

89
00:06:53,370 --> 00:06:55,290
Li Yu was one of them.

90
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:56,400
After he became

91
00:06:56,430 --> 00:06:57,659
the prefectural governor of Ninghu,

92
00:06:57,870 --> 00:06:59,550
he came to visit my father to thank him.

93
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:00,900
It was at that time

94
00:07:01,090 --> 00:07:02,610
that I met Li Yu by chance.

95
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:06,830
So that girl

96
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:08,920
isn't the daughter of the prefectural governor.

97
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:09,990
Su Wuming,

98
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:11,900
you were fooled by her from the very beginning.

99
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:13,530
Let me think about it.

100
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:17,480
Yingtao is Prefectural Governor Li's daughter.

101
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:18,450
It's ture.

102
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,810
Li Si can prove that.

103
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:25,190
As Xijun said,

104
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:27,140
the man called Prefectural Governor Li

105
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:29,260
is not Li Yu.

106
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,560
He's an imposter.

107
00:07:32,010 --> 00:07:32,630
Su Wuming,

108
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,280
you should take what Xijun said

109
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:35,400
with a grain of salt.

110
00:07:36,170 --> 00:07:37,070
What if she had a lapse of memory?

111
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:40,620
Before coming to Ninghu,

112
00:07:40,770 --> 00:07:42,490
Xijun has mentioned that to me already.

113
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:45,220
Although I don't like

114
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,080
the prefectural governor of Ninghu,

115
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:48,800
it's said that Ninghu

116
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:49,540
is a beautiful place.

117
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:52,100
Do you know

118
00:07:52,130 --> 00:07:53,570
Prefectural Governor Li of Ninghu?

119
00:07:53,970 --> 00:07:55,440
Why do you dislike him?

120
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:00,320
Forget it.

121
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:01,960
It has nothing to do with me.

122
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:02,790
Xijun,

123
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:04,260
draw a portrait of Li Yu

124
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:06,400
from your memory now.

125
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:20,040
Fed.

126
00:08:21,530 --> 00:08:22,150
Knockout

127
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:24,120
incense.

128
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,830
I forgot that she could use knockout incense.

129
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:28,880
I should have

130
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:29,630
tied her up.

131
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:41,250
Minister He.

132
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:42,559
You're awake.

133
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:46,800
I'm so sorry.

134
00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:49,340
As the the Minister of Justice,

135
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:51,150
I should've been more careful.

136
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:52,540
There's nothing to be sorry for.

137
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:54,410
Commander Su and I

138
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:55,800
were once set up in the same way too.

139
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:56,980
Minister Lu,

140
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,110
I was dismissive of you

141
00:08:58,220 --> 00:08:59,270
when we met yesterday

142
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:00,030
because you are Commander Su's personal staff.

143
00:09:00,730 --> 00:09:02,540
But you have saved me many times in Hanshan.

144
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:05,380
My apologies.

145
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:07,070
That's not worth mentioning.

146
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:08,860
Have a look

147
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:10,180
at this portrait.

148
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:17,080
Who is this?

149
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:20,160
Li Yu, the prefectural governor.

150
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:22,800
This is...

151
00:09:23,570 --> 00:09:24,600
This isn't Prefectural Governor Li.

152
00:09:27,690 --> 00:09:29,620
No wonder Gu Wenbin said

153
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:31,570
that Prefectural Governor Li had

154
00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:34,030
barely talked with his subordinates

155
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:37,100
and preferred communicating with them by letters.

156
00:09:38,290 --> 00:09:38,870
Minister He,

157
00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:40,520
are you all right now?

158
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:41,620
Yeah.

159
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:43,500
Go to the government office

160
00:09:43,530 --> 00:09:44,830
to check the official certificate and imperial edict

161
00:09:45,010 --> 00:09:47,700
that Prefectural Governor Li brought with him when he took office.

162
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:49,410
[Imperial Edict]

163
00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:48,300
Yes.

164
00:09:51,970 --> 00:09:54,400
The stamp of the Ministry of Personnel Administration is authentic.

165
00:09:57,220 --> 00:09:59,410
Li Yu's birthplace and parentage

166
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:00,950
are still the same.

167
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:05,500
But his age was rewritten.

168
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:12,850
His age on the imperial edict was rewritten too.

169
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:18,800
To take office here,

170
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:23,660
he should have the official certificate with the stamp of the Ministry of Personnel Administration,

171
00:10:24,210 --> 00:10:26,160
and the imperial edict issued by the Imperial Secretariat.

172
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:30,100
Besides, he should have the right half of the fish tally.

173
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:35,790
Yingtao's father

174
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:38,270
successfully took the place of Prefectural Governor Li.

175
00:10:38,290 --> 00:10:40,190
That means he had

176
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:44,780
the half of the fish tally belongs to Li Yu.

177
00:10:45,290 --> 00:10:46,620
Does that mean that

178
00:10:46,890 --> 00:10:48,570
the real Li Yu is dead?

179
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:54,920
It's possible to do so?

180
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:56,530
If I had known this method earlier,

181
00:10:57,070 --> 00:10:58,830
I could have replaced Su Wuming

182
00:10:59,210 --> 00:11:01,920
to be the Military Commander for several days.

183
00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:04,210
Master Fed,

184
00:11:04,610 --> 00:11:05,670
it's not funny.

185
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:08,720
The dates were rewritten carefully,

186
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:10,620
but anyone can notice it

187
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:12,060
after taking a close look.

188
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:13,930
Why…

189
00:11:14,330 --> 00:11:15,160
He was the prefectural governor.

190
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:16,470
No one had the guts

191
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,230
to examine and doubt his credentials.

192
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:20,920
You made a great point, Minister He.

193
00:11:21,230 --> 00:11:22,440
The false Li Yu

194
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:24,800
took advantage of that.

195
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,600
So now one case

196
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:28,690
has become two cases?

197
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:31,150
You are right.

198
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:34,270
What we are facing now

199
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:35,820
is much more complicated

200
00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:37,150
than cracking one case.

201
00:11:37,570 --> 00:11:38,130
In my opinion,

202
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:39,740
we shouldn't

203
00:11:39,770 --> 00:11:41,170
be distracted by the new clue.

204
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:43,620
Our priority

205
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:45,840
is still finding Yingtao's father

206
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,470
and getting the Records of Worshippers of Tuo God.

207
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:49,840
We can then eliminate that evil gang.

208
00:11:50,930 --> 00:11:53,080
To wipe them out,

209
00:11:53,510 --> 00:11:55,560
we must scout their lair first.

210
00:11:56,290 --> 00:11:58,720
But the Island of Tuo God is heavily guarded.

211
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:00,420
Only their own ships

212
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:01,680
are allowed

213
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:03,230
to pull ashore.

214
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:13,910
Why are you staring at me?

215
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:16,380
You want me

216
00:12:16,410 --> 00:12:17,640
to swim to that island?

217
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,270
I'm not capable of doing that.

218
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:55,840
How did you find me?

219
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:58,670
When you stayed

220
00:12:58,700 --> 00:12:59,760
in He Xi's detective house,

221
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:01,510
you often came

222
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:02,970
sitting here and staring into the air.

223
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:06,380
Your men have been watching me?

224
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:08,250
No.

225
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:10,530
I have.

226
00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:14,430
I just want to keep the daughter

227
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:16,020
of the prefectural governor safe.

228
00:13:17,890 --> 00:13:18,940
The daughter of the prefectural governor?

229
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:21,770
You know that's not me.

230
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,010
Tell me then.

231
00:13:26,970 --> 00:13:29,050
The prefectural governor is a high-ranking position.

232
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,160
I want to know

233
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:32,480
what on earth has happened.

234
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:34,460
Eliminate the Worshippers of Tuo God first.

235
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:36,340
After that,

236
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:38,570
I'll tell you everything.

237
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:40,270
I don't understand.

238
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:42,650
Why are you so hellbent

239
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:44,200
on eliminating them?

240
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:48,380
Because I don't want to let my father down.

241
00:13:50,190 --> 00:13:50,990
He's a good man,

242
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:53,550
and a good prefectural governor.

243
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:57,810
Where is Li Yu?

244
00:13:59,610 --> 00:14:01,050
He deserved to die.

245
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:02,960
Who killed him?

246
00:14:04,650 --> 00:14:05,230
You?

247
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:06,460
Your father?

248
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,540
Or Li Si?

249
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:10,270
I won't tell you.

250
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:11,690
I think

251
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:14,640
your father will tell me.

252
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:16,260
You can find my father?

253
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:23,620
[Grave of Li Si]

254
00:14:18,530 --> 00:14:20,080
Li Si killed himself

255
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:23,830
in order to cover up for your father.

256
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:25,360
We can say

257
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:27,560
that he died for your father.

258
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:30,300
They cared for each other.

259
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:31,680
I believe your father

260
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:32,940
will definitely come to pay his respects.

261
00:14:55,810 --> 00:14:56,510
Dad!

262
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:20,230
I'm Su Wuming, the new Military Commander of Ninghu.

263
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:22,820
I've heard a lot about you.

264
00:15:23,050 --> 00:15:24,570
I'm Chu Xiaosheng.

265
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:25,400
Mr. Chu,

266
00:15:26,610 --> 00:15:28,000
you must have a lot

267
00:15:28,030 --> 00:15:29,070
to tell me.

268
00:15:32,410 --> 00:15:33,430
What about you?

269
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:35,200
What do you want to say to me?

270
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:37,380
I want to say,

271
00:15:37,530 --> 00:15:39,030
if I let you go today,

272
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:41,470
I'm breaking the law.

273
00:15:42,890 --> 00:15:43,600
Su Wuming.

274
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:44,580
I dare you get in my dad's way!

275
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:45,580
Behave yourself!

276
00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:46,380
Let me kill him

277
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,090
and take you out of Ninghu.

278
00:15:49,170 --> 00:15:50,510
I've heard about him

279
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:52,400
many years ago.

280
00:15:52,890 --> 00:15:53,690
He is the disciple of Detective Di,

281
00:15:54,290 --> 00:15:55,260
and is a wise and decent man.

282
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:57,340
I respect him.

283
00:15:57,590 --> 00:15:58,680
Don't do anything stupid!

284
00:15:59,100 --> 00:15:59,550
Dad.

285
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,610
I came to pay my respects to Li Si

286
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,300
so that I can meet him.

287
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:06,620
Put away your sword!

288
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:09,570
Dad,

289
00:16:10,650 --> 00:16:11,580
are you sure you want this?

290
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:13,220
This is our best chance

291
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:14,020
to escape.

292
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:15,350
Escape?

293
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:21,430
I'm afraid there's no turning back for me now.

294
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:23,100
Dad!

295
00:16:23,210 --> 00:16:23,830
Back off!

296
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:32,840
Li Si said

297
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:35,100
it was him who killed the Chang'an woman

298
00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:36,260
in the coffin.

299
00:16:40,570 --> 00:16:42,450
Chu Si,

300
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:45,080
you were such a fool.

301
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,450
Even if you said that,

302
00:16:49,010 --> 00:16:51,200
who would've believe you?

303
00:16:53,170 --> 00:16:54,520
His name is Chu Si?

304
00:16:55,690 --> 00:16:57,170
I should have thought of that.

305
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:00,740
The woman in the coffin

306
00:17:01,830 --> 00:17:03,810
was a singer

307
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:05,099
Li Yu met in Pingkang Fang in Chang'an.

308
00:17:07,290 --> 00:17:09,359
Although Li Yu was mediocre,

309
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:11,950
he treated that girl well.

310
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:14,540
Otherwise, she wouldn't have come all the way to see him.

311
00:17:15,329 --> 00:17:16,589
But she didn't expect

312
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:18,800
the current prefectural governor of Ninghu

313
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:21,829
to be someone else.

314
00:17:23,170 --> 00:17:24,920
Yingtao met her too, right?

315
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:26,520
I killed her.

316
00:17:27,099 --> 00:17:27,900
It has nothing to do with my dad.

317
00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:29,490
I'm a wanderer.

318
00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:31,050
I kill a lot.

319
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:32,500
Su Wuming,

320
00:17:32,690 --> 00:17:33,200
you've seen it too.

321
00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:33,800
Yingtao,

322
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:35,180
at this point,

323
00:17:35,710 --> 00:17:36,870
what's the point of you

324
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:38,300
taking the rap for me?

325
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:39,070
Dad!

326
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:41,660
I must kill that woman.

327
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:43,180
Because if she made a scene,

328
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:44,820
my identity would be exposed.

329
00:17:45,370 --> 00:17:46,620
My plan of leading troops to the island

330
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:48,350
to annihilate the Worshippers of Tuo God

331
00:17:48,570 --> 00:17:49,630
would be ruined too.

332
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:54,070
You planned to lead troops to that island?

333
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:02,350
Li.

334
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:05,090
Li.

335
00:18:12,210 --> 00:18:12,760
Li.

336
00:18:13,650 --> 00:18:14,610
After we parted in Chang'an,

337
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:16,070
I've been missing you day and night.

338
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:18,240
I finally found you.

339
00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:21,210
Li.

340
00:18:25,770 --> 00:18:26,650
You are...

341
00:18:27,230 --> 00:18:28,440
Li Yu, the prefectural governor.

342
00:18:29,210 --> 00:18:30,040
Li Yu?

343
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:32,060
You're not Li Yu.

344
00:19:03,090 --> 00:19:04,370
There's a secret passage in the mansion.

345
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,570
I only discovered it recently.

346
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:09,980
That day, I suddenly found that

347
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:11,770
the Records of Worshippers of Tuo God

348
00:19:12,010 --> 00:19:13,030
on my bookshelf

349
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:14,500
was gone.

350
00:19:15,450 --> 00:19:17,020
I asked Chu Si about it.

351
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:19,560
He said no one came in from outside.

352
00:19:20,030 --> 00:19:22,810
I suspected that there was a secret passage in the room.

353
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:24,980
I searched for two days

354
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:26,500
and I finally found it.

355
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:27,590
I later got to know

356
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:29,820
that not only my room was broken in,

357
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:30,900
the whole prefectural governor's mansion

358
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:32,870
was searched thoroughly.

359
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:35,870
The Worshippers of Tuo God

360
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:37,710
seemed to be aware

361
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:38,900
of my plan against them.

362
00:19:39,230 --> 00:19:41,190
But I was already one of them by then,

363
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:44,010
and Shen Chong trusted me.

364
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:46,750
Have you ever told anyone

365
00:19:46,930 --> 00:19:48,690
about writing the Records?

366
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:49,460
No.

367
00:19:50,010 --> 00:19:51,270
I didn't tell anyone.

368
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:54,470
Luckily, the two scrolls of Records

369
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:56,120
I hid in the compartment beneath my desk

370
00:19:56,660 --> 00:19:57,860
were not found by them.

371
00:19:58,280 --> 00:19:59,170
I hid one scroll

372
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:01,370
in the Temple of Tuo God in the suburb.

373
00:20:01,390 --> 00:20:03,040
[Records of Worshippers of Tuo God]

374
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:03,310
That was the scroll

375
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:04,790
you gave Yingtao.

376
00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:07,310
Yes. I came up with two plans.

377
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:08,340
Plan A,

378
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:09,730
I'll lead troops to attack the island.

379
00:20:10,010 --> 00:20:10,410
Plan B,

380
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:11,940
Yingtao will bring the Records

381
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:13,770
to Chang'an.

382
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:15,810
But unfortunately,

383
00:20:16,410 --> 00:20:17,800
the person who wanted to kill me

384
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:19,220
came too soon.

385
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:22,620
I've just killed that woman from Chang'an

386
00:20:22,970 --> 00:20:24,320
and the assassin arrived.

387
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:26,580
At first, I thought

388
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:27,740
the left-hand swordsman

389
00:20:27,930 --> 00:20:29,090
was sent by the Worshippers.

390
00:20:30,130 --> 00:20:32,290
But when that giant alligator appeared,

391
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:33,580
I realized that

392
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,350
the real killer they sent was that beast.

393
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:38,460
I hid in the coffin.

394
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:40,690
That assassin

395
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:41,770
died for me.

396
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:44,050
That's how I survived.

397
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:47,220
I realized afterwards

398
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:50,420
that the Worshippers of Tuo God trusted me no more.

399
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:51,790
That meant

400
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:53,300
I lost

401
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:55,300
the opportunity to lead troops to the island.

402
00:20:55,970 --> 00:20:57,940
So you dressed that assassin

403
00:20:57,980 --> 00:20:59,220
in your uniform

404
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:00,650
to fake your death.

405
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:02,660
But I don't understand

406
00:21:02,690 --> 00:21:04,470
why didn't you leave

407
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:05,520
the mansion by the lake immediately.

408
00:21:06,410 --> 00:21:07,470
There are spies of the Worshippers

409
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:09,740
everywhere in Ninghu.

410
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:11,820
Nowhere is safe for me.

411
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:12,840
So I might as well

412
00:21:13,130 --> 00:21:14,680
hide in that tomb temporarily.

413
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:17,860
I never thought

414
00:21:19,130 --> 00:21:20,670
my career as the fake prefectural governor

415
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:23,450
would end like this.

416
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:25,060
Dad,

417
00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:27,880
the scroll in the temple

418
00:21:29,610 --> 00:21:31,190
has fallen into the hands of the Worshippers.

419
00:21:33,310 --> 00:21:34,450
I knew that.

420
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:37,170
Luckily, I made two copies of them.

421
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:39,140
This is the last copy

422
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:40,400
of the Records of Worshippers of Tuo God.

423
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:43,730
Please keep it safe.

424
00:21:44,410 --> 00:21:45,090
I will.

425
00:21:48,230 --> 00:21:49,070
Yingtao,

426
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:50,660
Commander Su

427
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:52,530
is trustworthy.

428
00:21:54,470 --> 00:21:55,720
You should

429
00:21:56,490 --> 00:21:57,540
work together with him

430
00:21:58,100 --> 00:21:59,420
to wipe out the Worshippers.

431
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:00,990
Dad,

432
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:04,070
it's his business to wipe out them.

433
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:06,010
I just want

434
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:07,760
to travel around the world with you.

435
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:08,810
You fool!

436
00:22:09,190 --> 00:22:10,210
If I run away,

437
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:12,220
what I did will be brought to light.

438
00:22:12,970 --> 00:22:14,580
I'll become a murderer.

439
00:22:15,170 --> 00:22:16,050
Think about it.

440
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:17,670
Who would believe

441
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:19,450
the records written by a murderer?

442
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:22,100
What else can you use

443
00:22:22,130 --> 00:22:23,710
to bring the Worshippers to justice?

444
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:25,120
But dad…

445
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:26,000
Enough.

446
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:29,560
Commander Su,

447
00:22:31,390 --> 00:22:32,780
the Records have to be written

448
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:34,000
by the prefectural governor

449
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:36,050
if they are to be used

450
00:22:36,150 --> 00:22:37,690
to wipe out the Worshippers

451
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:39,110
by righteous people

452
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:40,340
like you.

453
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,990
I bet you know what to do.

454
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:47,290
I will do my best.

455
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:48,730
Besides,

456
00:22:53,210 --> 00:22:54,950
I want to ask you for a favor.

457
00:22:55,450 --> 00:22:56,150
Go ahead.

458
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:02,330
I want to entrust my daughter

459
00:23:03,030 --> 00:23:04,100
to you.

460
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:05,390
Dad!

461
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:08,530
Will you kindly

462
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,350
grant my wish?

463
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:11,590
Well…

464
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:15,580
I can see benevolence and wisdom

465
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,230
in your eyes.

466
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:19,820
I'll take that as a yes.

467
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:35,460
Father,

468
00:23:36,170 --> 00:23:37,760
the lakeside is moist and cold.

469
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:39,070
Let me take you to somewhere else

470
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:39,700
to have a rest.

471
00:23:41,410 --> 00:23:42,260
Yingtao,

472
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:44,530
I'm tired.

473
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:46,630
I can't walk anymore.

474
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:50,560
I don't want to walk either.

475
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:53,740
In Ninghu,

476
00:23:55,310 --> 00:23:57,800
I've done something for the people.

477
00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:00,640
Building the dam,

478
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:02,170
dredging the river,

479
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:03,850
and countering the flood.

480
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:09,510
My biggest regret

481
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:13,300
is that I didn't

482
00:24:13,770 --> 00:24:15,440
get rid of the Worshippers of Tuo God.

483
00:24:16,970 --> 00:24:17,450
Father!

484
00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:19,680
Father, what's wrong with you?

485
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:22,270
Father!

486
00:24:24,190 --> 00:24:24,820
Father!

487
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:27,550
Father!

488
00:24:28,410 --> 00:24:29,050
Mr. Chu.

489
00:24:29,270 --> 00:24:30,110
Father!

490
00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:34,700
Father!

491
00:24:38,190 --> 00:24:40,910
C-Commander Su.

492
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:41,630
Father.

493
00:24:46,330 --> 00:24:47,680
You must

494
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:49,950
protect

495
00:24:51,530 --> 00:24:52,160
Ying...

496
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:54,840
Father!

497
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:56,760
Father!

498
00:24:59,710 --> 00:25:01,370
Father!

499
00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:17,550
Fed,

500
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:19,470
don't drag me.

501
00:25:20,250 --> 00:25:21,330
Steal wine from Yaoyue Restaurant?

502
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:22,980
This is not what a gentleman should do.

503
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:23,740
I'm not going.

504
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:25,900
Can you bear looking at me having no wine?

505
00:25:25,970 --> 00:25:27,030
Didn't you drink the Tuo God Wine

506
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:28,990
at Hanshan last night?

507
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:29,910
That is the reason

508
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:31,180
why I'm addicted.

509
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:32,640
Then drink at Hanshan again.

510
00:25:32,670 --> 00:25:33,180
I...

511
00:25:34,010 --> 00:25:35,960
I've heard something.

512
00:25:36,430 --> 00:25:38,380
Something happened at Hanshan last night.

513
00:25:38,670 --> 00:25:41,580
The Hanshan Banquet will be cancelled in the future.

514
00:25:41,930 --> 00:25:43,540
I won't be able to drink it even if I want to.

515
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:46,940
Fed,

516
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:49,020
is wine really your life?

517
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:50,920
Well...

518
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:52,700
Cut the crap.

519
00:25:53,250 --> 00:25:54,010
Are you

520
00:25:54,210 --> 00:25:55,730
afraid of the Worshippers of Tuo God?

521
00:25:56,890 --> 00:25:57,860
What did you say?

522
00:25:58,020 --> 00:25:59,090
I'm not afraid of them.

523
00:25:59,120 --> 00:25:59,440
This...

524
00:26:06,650 --> 00:26:07,530
Are you trying to provoke me?

525
00:26:08,130 --> 00:26:09,390
No, no, no.

526
00:26:09,410 --> 00:26:10,530
Listen to me.

527
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:12,670
I'm not doing this for myself.

528
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:15,690
I'm doing it for the people of Ninghu.

529
00:26:15,930 --> 00:26:17,740
I'm defending against the injustice for them.

530
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:19,100
Think about it.

531
00:26:19,650 --> 00:26:21,030
They worked so hard

532
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:22,560
to make the wine,

533
00:26:22,590 --> 00:26:24,120
but yet they are not qualified to drink it.

534
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:25,450
If they want to drink it,

535
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,180
they have to thank

536
00:26:27,670 --> 00:26:28,830
and worship

537
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:29,990
the Tuo God.

538
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:31,510
Does that make sense?

539
00:26:33,570 --> 00:26:34,480
You are right.

540
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:35,330
Let's go.

541
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:57,510
Delivering wine at night,

542
00:26:57,580 --> 00:26:58,540
we should be careful.

543
00:26:58,930 --> 00:26:59,440
What are you afraid of?

544
00:27:00,010 --> 00:27:01,350
Who dares to steal the God Wine?

545
00:27:01,370 --> 00:27:02,010
Do they want to die?

546
00:27:02,210 --> 00:27:03,010
Let's knock on the door.

547
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:07,610
Keep quiet,

548
00:27:08,790 --> 00:27:10,780
or I'll send you to hell.

549
00:27:21,050 --> 00:27:21,680
Sir,

550
00:27:22,250 --> 00:27:24,220
how many will you take today?

551
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,110
T-T-Ten...

552
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,720
Ten jars.

553
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:28,730
Ten?

554
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:32,240
Didn't it use to be seven jars every time previously?

555
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:34,260
How dare you question the drinking capacity of the Tuo God?

556
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:35,500
No, no.

557
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:36,860
I dare not.

558
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:37,660
Carry them!

559
00:27:45,370 --> 00:27:46,820
Help!

560
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:48,060
Help!

561
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:51,260
Kneel!

562
00:27:51,650 --> 00:27:52,780
The wine of the Tuo God was stolen.

563
00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:53,740
Is there anything more concerning than this

564
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:56,260
in Ninghu?

565
00:27:56,660 --> 00:27:57,780
W-W-We...

566
00:27:57,940 --> 00:27:58,860
We were wrong.

567
00:27:59,020 --> 00:27:59,740
We deserve to die!

568
00:28:00,010 --> 00:28:00,820
We deserve to die!

569
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:01,580
We deserve to die!

570
00:28:01,770 --> 00:28:02,460
You think you deserve to die?

571
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:03,260
Please spare me!

572
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:04,580
Then die!

573
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:06,500
Throw them into the Swamp of Alligators!

574
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:07,540
No!

575
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:09,100
-Please spare me, Tuo God! -Please spare my life, Tuo God!

576
00:28:09,250 --> 00:28:10,130
Tuo God!

577
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:11,420
Please spare me!

578
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:12,500
Please spare my life!

579
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:14,530
Shen Chong,

580
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:15,820
from now on,

581
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:17,820
you will take over Yaoyue Restaurant

582
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:19,260
and find out

583
00:28:19,370 --> 00:28:20,620
who is going against me.

584
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:22,700
Yes, Tuo God.

585
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:24,650
Please spare me.

586
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:26,660
We don't want to die!

587
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:45,780
Here, Fed.

588
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:46,980
Come on.

589
00:28:47,180 --> 00:28:47,620
Cheers!

590
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:48,860
Drink it! Drink it!

591
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:50,580
Brother has not been back all night.

592
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:52,300
You still have the mood to drink?

593
00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:54,620
He has not been back all night.

594
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:56,300
That means he has found Yingtao.

595
00:28:56,450 --> 00:28:57,180
That Yingtao

596
00:28:57,580 --> 00:28:59,090
is a woman from the martial world.

597
00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:01,100
But Su Wuming still thinks

598
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:02,700
she's the daughter of the prefectural governor.

599
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:04,060
How ridiculous.

600
00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:05,340
Maybe

601
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:07,140
he's playing dumb.

602
00:29:07,450 --> 00:29:09,260
He has fallen in love with Yingtao.

603
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:10,460
Right?

604
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:12,340
That makes sense.

605
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:13,170
Right?

606
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:14,380
It would be good

607
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:16,460
if Mr. Su were here

608
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:17,340
when you said those words.

609
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:19,260
I really want to see him getting awkward.

610
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:20,460
Awkward?

611
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:22,740
I'm sure he wouldn't.

612
00:29:23,420 --> 00:29:24,220
He

613
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:25,540
is too thick-skinned.

614
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:28,460
Who is thick-skinned?

615
00:29:31,780 --> 00:29:33,460
You've cooked so many dishes.

616
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:36,420
What day is today?

617
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:39,140
We just felt that it must be exhausting for you

618
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:40,220
to hang out all night.

619
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:40,940
Here.

620
00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:45,850
I found Yingtao's father.

621
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:48,050
The fake Li Yu?

622
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:52,360
He has committed suicide.

623
00:29:53,410 --> 00:29:55,260
He was a scholar,

624
00:29:55,590 --> 00:29:56,880
but became a criminal.

625
00:29:57,380 --> 00:29:58,760
He pretended to be the prefectural governor,

626
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:01,210
but he had political achievements.

627
00:30:04,290 --> 00:30:05,070
What about Yingtao?

628
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:07,770
She's keeping vigil for her father.

629
00:30:13,850 --> 00:30:14,380
Fed,

630
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:16,890
did you really get the wine?

631
00:30:18,510 --> 00:30:20,020
Is there anything I can't do?

632
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:22,100
Wait.

633
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:24,250
How did you know about

634
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:26,170
the things we have done?

635
00:30:26,770 --> 00:30:28,020
I'm the one who asked Fed

636
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:30,250
to bring you to get the wine.

637
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:33,130
So it was your idea.

638
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:35,020
This is not like you.

639
00:30:35,310 --> 00:30:36,090
Why not?

640
00:30:37,490 --> 00:30:38,640
The good wine is made in the city,

641
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:40,610
yet the commoners can't drink it.

642
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,580
Neither can the officials.

643
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:42,240
Why?

644
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:43,790
Besides,

645
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:46,770
I used the word "get".

646
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:48,010
I didn't use the word "steal"

647
00:30:48,010 --> 00:30:49,220
or "rob".

648
00:30:49,770 --> 00:30:50,820
You've asked him to get the wine

649
00:30:51,570 --> 00:30:52,520
for a reason.

650
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:55,690
Firstly,

651
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:57,220
it is for us to drink.

652
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:01,460
Secondly,

653
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:06,490
it is to draw the attention against ourselves.

654
00:31:06,530 --> 00:31:11,130
[Commander's Residence]

655
00:31:12,710 --> 00:31:13,310
Hurry up.

656
00:31:13,350 --> 00:31:14,110
Hurry up. Let's go.

657
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:14,940
Let's go.

658
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:15,680
Let's go.

659
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:19,620
Su Wuming!

660
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:22,120
The Tuo God Wine in Yaoyue Restaurant was stolen.

661
00:31:22,850 --> 00:31:23,860
I suspect

662
00:31:24,410 --> 00:31:25,550
that it was your subordinate.

663
00:31:26,570 --> 00:31:27,970
If you don't hand Lu Lingfeng over,

664
00:31:28,930 --> 00:31:31,460
Ninghu will be punished by Tuo God.

665
00:31:36,770 --> 00:31:37,440
Chief,

666
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:38,860
I've found out

667
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:40,900
that the wine was indeed stolen by Su Wuming's subordinate,

668
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:42,030
Lu Lingfeng.

669
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:45,020
This Commander Su

670
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:47,690
doesn't know how powerful the Tuo God is.

671
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:50,550
Is the person you planted

672
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:51,490
in the Worshippers of Tuo God reliable?

673
00:31:52,330 --> 00:31:53,030
Absolutely.

674
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:55,550
You want to use him?

675
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:02,800
Please ask him to convey the news of Lu Lingfeng stealing wine

676
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:05,610
to Shen Chong.

677
00:32:06,270 --> 00:32:07,420
Anyone disrespectful to the Tuo God

678
00:32:07,450 --> 00:32:08,480
will die for sure!

679
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:10,140
Hand over the wine thief!

680
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:12,620
Su Wuming, get out of Ninghu!

681
00:32:12,710 --> 00:32:14,850
Su Wuming, get out of Ninghu!

682
00:32:15,340 --> 00:32:15,780
Xue Huan!

683
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:16,960
Come back!

684
00:32:17,270 --> 00:32:19,310
Su Wuming, get out of Ninghu!

685
00:32:19,610 --> 00:32:21,550
Su Wuming, get out of Ninghu!

686
00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:23,590
Su Wuming, get out of Ninghu!

687
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:25,650
Su Wuming, get out of Ninghu!

688
00:32:25,790 --> 00:32:27,550
Su Wuming, get out of Ninghu!

689
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:28,330
Su Wuming,

690
00:32:29,050 --> 00:32:29,730
you have drunk

691
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:31,390
this wine too.

692
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:33,880
What are you talking about?

693
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:35,780
Even if he hadn't drunk it,

694
00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:37,300
he wouldn't hand you over.

695
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:37,980
Wait.

696
00:32:39,010 --> 00:32:40,630
Fed asked me to steal the wine.

697
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:43,330
Why didn't they want him?

698
00:32:43,570 --> 00:32:44,780
You're curious about this, right?

699
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:46,860
That's because I'm a person of good character.

700
00:32:47,780 --> 00:32:49,100
Of course, you're not bad.

701
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:50,510
You're just unlucky.

702
00:32:51,580 --> 00:32:53,540
No matter who they want,

703
00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:56,350
I must hand over to them.

704
00:32:57,270 --> 00:32:58,080
Really?

705
00:32:58,770 --> 00:32:59,350
Brother,

706
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:00,620
the Worshippers of Tuo God are not good.

707
00:33:00,810 --> 00:33:01,940
It's dangerous to hand him over.

708
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:04,150
Didn't you hear the people outside

709
00:33:04,180 --> 00:33:06,180
surrounding the Commander's residence?

710
00:33:06,410 --> 00:33:07,140
If I don't hand him over,

711
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:09,260
how can I get through this?

712
00:33:09,850 --> 00:33:10,300
Sir,

713
00:33:10,970 --> 00:33:11,970
please don't hand over

714
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:12,790
my master.

715
00:33:12,890 --> 00:33:14,230
Should he hand me over then?

716
00:33:14,730 --> 00:33:16,580
I'm an old man who is old and weak.

717
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:20,870
Hand me over then.

718
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:22,460
Let's see what they can do to me.

719
00:33:24,590 --> 00:33:25,780
You're still young.

720
00:33:26,550 --> 00:33:28,660
You have to wait for a few years to be able to bear this responsibility.

721
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:34,180
Stealing the so-called God Wine

722
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:36,060
is a serious crime

723
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:37,000
for the Worshippers of Tuo God.

724
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:39,600
They will take you

725
00:33:39,630 --> 00:33:41,250
to the island for execution.

726
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:43,980
I knew it.

727
00:33:44,370 --> 00:33:46,970
Before we go to the island on the Double Third Festival,

728
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,410
we need someone to scout the way.

729
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:49,430
I

730
00:33:49,830 --> 00:33:50,380
am the most suitable.

731
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:51,140
Right.

732
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:52,030
I disagree.

733
00:33:53,170 --> 00:33:54,500
Even if it's a countering trick,

734
00:33:54,980 --> 00:33:56,070
it's too risky.

735
00:33:56,620 --> 00:33:58,390
I love to take risks.

736
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:01,120
Don't worry, Xijun.

737
00:34:04,370 --> 00:34:05,350
-Brother. -Wait.

738
00:34:07,060 --> 00:34:08,290
Why is it so troublesome?

739
00:34:13,290 --> 00:34:14,280
One more thing.

740
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:16,780
Let Xijun draw a leaf

741
00:34:16,929 --> 00:34:17,960
on your arm.

742
00:34:18,210 --> 00:34:20,260
After you reach the Island of Tuo God,

743
00:34:20,750 --> 00:34:23,400
look for a tree with these leaves.

744
00:34:24,620 --> 00:34:25,179
A tree?

745
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:28,739
Su Wuming, get out of Ninghu!

746
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:30,909
Su Wuming, get out of Ninghu!

747
00:34:30,949 --> 00:34:33,199
-Su Wuming, get out of Ninghu! -Lu Lingfeng is here.

748
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:35,420
You stole the wine?

749
00:34:35,860 --> 00:34:36,300
Yes.

750
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:37,120
Where's the wine?

751
00:34:37,610 --> 00:34:39,110
I drank it, of course.

752
00:34:41,510 --> 00:34:43,270
How dare you!

753
00:34:43,889 --> 00:34:44,630
This matter

754
00:34:45,210 --> 00:34:47,030
has nothing to do with the others in the Commander's residence.

755
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:49,330
Commander Su knew nothing about it.

756
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:50,679
Not bad.

757
00:34:51,860 --> 00:34:53,010
You're a good servant.

758
00:34:53,650 --> 00:34:55,010
But don't think that I will let Su Wuming off

759
00:34:55,469 --> 00:34:57,260
just because I caught you.

760
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:59,790
What crime have I committed?

761
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:03,880
Commander Su,

762
00:35:05,190 --> 00:35:06,430
your crime is

763
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:09,830
not disciplining your servant well.

764
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:12,920
So what?

765
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:14,730
Are you

766
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:16,370
taking me

767
00:35:16,390 --> 00:35:18,470
to the Island of Tuo God too?

768
00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:19,450
You...

769
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:21,980
Chief.

770
00:35:22,290 --> 00:35:23,780
Su Wuming

771
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:25,000
is the Military Commander of the city.

772
00:35:30,490 --> 00:35:33,410
Commander Su, you're on your own now.

773
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:39,750
Let's go.

774
00:36:03,770 --> 00:36:04,610
Stealing anything is fine,

775
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:06,110
but stealing the God Wine?

776
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:08,140
You are digging your own grave.

777
00:36:11,770 --> 00:36:13,080
What can you do to me?

778
00:36:14,260 --> 00:36:16,090
After we arrive at the island, you will be handed over to the Guardian,

779
00:36:16,230 --> 00:36:16,940
and then thrown into

780
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:17,700
the Swamp of Alligators.

781
00:36:19,580 --> 00:36:21,100
Swamp of Alligators?

782
00:36:23,970 --> 00:36:25,000
I want to see the Tuo God.

783
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:26,550
Can you send my request?

784
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:27,820
See the Tuo God?

785
00:36:28,070 --> 00:36:29,100
Who do you think you are?

786
00:36:29,290 --> 00:36:30,260
Keep an eye on him.

787
00:36:30,450 --> 00:36:31,480
We're almost at the center of the lake.

788
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:32,840
The wind is strong.

789
00:36:33,250 --> 00:36:34,620
Don't let it blow him away.

790
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:35,340
Yes.

791
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:39,910
Let's go.

792
00:37:44,090 --> 00:37:46,500
This tree is called Hitholon Tree,

793
00:37:46,580 --> 00:37:48,400
and is also known as Blood Silkworm Tree.

794
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:49,940
It's Tianzhu's specialty,

795
00:37:50,190 --> 00:37:52,570
growing around swamps

796
00:37:52,610 --> 00:37:53,650
where alligators can be found.

797
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:56,300
Although alligators like to consume humans,

798
00:37:56,340 --> 00:37:57,530
they prefer

799
00:37:58,050 --> 00:38:00,180
eating the leaves of this tree.

800
00:38:05,050 --> 00:38:05,780
Did they steal

801
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:07,850
the Tuo God Wine as well?

802
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:09,880
They are not as bold as you.

803
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:11,380
They are just some

804
00:38:11,380 --> 00:38:12,740
disobedient commoners and merchants

805
00:38:12,740 --> 00:38:14,020
who refused to pay the temple donations and the fees.

806
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:17,870
Why does it sound like

807
00:38:18,370 --> 00:38:19,570
I've done nothing compared to them?

808
00:38:19,850 --> 00:38:21,000
It's just a few jars of wine.

809
00:38:21,690 --> 00:38:23,240
That's because the only thing that the Tuo God likes,

810
00:38:23,780 --> 00:38:25,130
is wine.

811
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:25,900
Let's go.

812
00:38:31,020 --> 00:38:32,600
Someone will escort you up the mountain later.

813
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:34,430
The Tuo God River by the mountain road

814
00:38:34,460 --> 00:38:35,760
is your only way to escape.

815
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:37,540
Who are you?

816
00:38:37,970 --> 00:38:38,680
I sent letters to you

817
00:38:39,510 --> 00:38:40,510
at Hanshan.

818
00:38:42,860 --> 00:38:43,410
He Xi.

819
00:38:45,140 --> 00:38:46,740
Someone outside asked me to give it to you.

820
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:52,260
Hurry up!

821
00:38:52,530 --> 00:38:53,130
Keep up!

822
00:39:02,450 --> 00:39:03,380
Lu Lingfeng, the criminal who offended the Tuo God

823
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:05,260
and stole the God Wine.

824
00:39:05,350 --> 00:39:06,430
He shall now be handed over to the Guardian.

825
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:12,160
The Tuo God wants to see

826
00:39:12,740 --> 00:39:14,380
what you are like.

827
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:16,680
How dare you steal his wine!

828
00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:18,670
Since he's a god,

829
00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:20,190
why is he so stingy?

830
00:39:21,370 --> 00:39:22,770
How dare you!

831
00:39:23,130 --> 00:39:24,930
You'll be thrown into the Swamp of Alligators.

832
00:39:25,540 --> 00:39:27,500
You'll have no bones left then.

833
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:29,540
Take him up the mountain.

834
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:30,140
Yes.

835
00:39:41,050 --> 00:39:41,370
Go.

836
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:53,610
Let's go.

837
00:40:11,730 --> 00:40:13,510
Congratulations, Mr. Zeng.

838
00:40:13,590 --> 00:40:14,930
Congratulations, Mr. Zeng.

839
00:40:14,970 --> 00:40:16,340
Thank you.

840
00:40:16,370 --> 00:40:17,440
Congratulations, Mr Zeng.

841
00:40:17,780 --> 00:40:18,610
Congratulations, Mr Zeng.

842
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:19,960
Thank you.

843
00:40:20,140 --> 00:40:20,740
Mr. Zeng.

844
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:21,640
Congratulations, Mr. Zeng.

845
00:40:22,780 --> 00:40:23,570
Mr. Zeng,

846
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:25,290
I'm sorry

847
00:40:25,660 --> 00:40:27,370
to be late.

848
00:40:27,740 --> 00:40:28,420
Commander Su,

849
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:31,390
I thought you weren't coming.

850
00:40:32,670 --> 00:40:34,170
Didn't Administrator Gu

851
00:40:34,190 --> 00:40:35,300
tell me about it long ago?

852
00:40:35,420 --> 00:40:38,260
Minister Zeng has worked hard for Ninghu half of his life.

853
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:40,020
I wouldn't dare to be absent

854
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:41,420
at your retirement banquet.

855
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:44,530
Thank you, Commander Su.

856
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:46,720
Please take a seat.

857
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:50,900
I heard that you went to Hanshan that night,

858
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:53,010
and there was some accident.

859
00:40:53,770 --> 00:40:54,610
Yes.

860
00:40:55,930 --> 00:40:57,400
I dare not to go

861
00:40:57,860 --> 00:41:00,060
to Hanshan again.

862
00:41:01,530 --> 00:41:02,830
Speaking of Hanshan,

863
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:05,290
Minister Zeng is the most experienced.

864
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:08,750
Back then,

865
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:11,590
I worked in Hanshan Department.

866
00:41:12,670 --> 00:41:14,070
So I know very well

867
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:15,680
what's going on there.

868
00:41:16,820 --> 00:41:17,790
It's complicated.

869
00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:22,220
It's not only the shelter for the homeless,

870
00:41:23,330 --> 00:41:25,690
but also the hiding place

871
00:41:25,730 --> 00:41:27,060
of many criminals.

872
00:41:28,450 --> 00:41:30,210
But Commander Su,

873
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:32,480
if you have any trouble in the future

874
00:41:32,510 --> 00:41:33,460
where you need to go to Hanshan,

875
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:34,450
just tell me.

876
00:41:34,990 --> 00:41:37,080
I'll go with you.

877
00:41:37,490 --> 00:41:38,410
The people there

878
00:41:38,540 --> 00:41:40,500
will have some respect for me.

879
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:43,990
That's great. Thank you, Minister Zeng.

880
00:41:44,570 --> 00:41:45,800
Let's drink.

881
00:41:46,130 --> 00:41:46,930
To Minister Zeng.

882
00:41:48,020 --> 00:41:48,620
To Minister Zeng.

883
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:49,490
To Minister Zeng.

884
00:41:52,210 --> 00:41:54,120
Shen Chong, Chief of the Worshippers of Tuo God,

885
00:41:54,230 --> 00:41:55,660
came to celebrate Minister Zeng's birthday.

886
00:41:56,020 --> 00:41:56,660
Look

887
00:41:56,970 --> 00:41:58,370
what have I brought you.

888
00:42:00,330 --> 00:42:00,920
This is...

889
00:42:02,740 --> 00:42:03,690
This is the Tuo God Wine.

890
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:04,490
Tuo God Wine?

891
00:42:05,060 --> 00:42:05,700
Minister Zeng,

892
00:42:05,730 --> 00:42:07,780
you're so honored.

893
00:42:07,910 --> 00:42:09,950
The Tuo God specially told me

894
00:42:10,430 --> 00:42:12,390
to present the wine to Minister Zeng.

895
00:42:16,140 --> 00:42:17,620
Have a seat.

896
00:42:18,180 --> 00:42:18,610
Sit.

897
00:42:19,980 --> 00:42:21,550
Have a seat.

898
00:42:22,010 --> 00:42:22,850
Administrator Gu.

899
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:23,820
Yes.

900
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:27,380
The God Sighting Ceremony on the Island of Tuo God tomorrow

901
00:42:27,410 --> 00:42:28,760
will be held as scheduled.

902
00:42:29,660 --> 00:42:31,440
The number and list of people you reported

903
00:42:31,660 --> 00:42:32,450
are fine.

904
00:42:32,750 --> 00:42:35,600
By then, all officials in Ninghu

905
00:42:36,650 --> 00:42:38,720
should be present.

906
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:42,440
I will obey the order of the Tuo God.

907
00:42:44,670 --> 00:42:45,990
Our boat will be waiting for

908
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:47,310
all of you tomorrow morning.

909
00:42:49,310 --> 00:42:52,420
I'm afraid I can't make it.

910
00:42:55,770 --> 00:42:57,740
The Tuo God showed respect to you,

911
00:42:59,310 --> 00:43:01,880
but you didn't show respect to the Tuo God.

912
00:43:02,940 --> 00:43:04,020
Even if you've retired,

913
00:43:04,780 --> 00:43:07,060
you can leave after

914
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:08,380
the God Sighting Ceremony.

915
00:43:10,090 --> 00:43:11,180
I'm really sorry.

916
00:43:11,970 --> 00:43:13,120
My schedule is set.

917
00:43:13,550 --> 00:43:14,980
I can't do what you said.

918
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:16,420
Zeng Sanyi!

919
00:43:29,550 --> 00:43:33,650
♫The storm rises with no reason♫

♫It's because of justice♫

928
00:44:13,940 --> 00:44:19,800
♫That I seek a truth for this long, lonely night♫
