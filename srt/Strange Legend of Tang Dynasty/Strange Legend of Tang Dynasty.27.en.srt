[Episode 27]

4
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,690
What do you mean?

5
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:06,130
The Prefectural Governor of Luozhou, Gao Zhongyi,

6
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:07,850
is the confidant of the Princess, Her Highness.

7
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:09,770
Since he dares to summon you to Luoyang

8
00:02:09,949 --> 00:02:10,830
in the name of the imperial court,

9
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:12,050
it must be the order from Her Highness.

10
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:13,230
Besides, Luoyang

11
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:14,570
is Her Highness's home.

12
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:16,380
Many of her trusted subordinates

13
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:17,040
are there.

14
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:18,990
So this time we go to Luoyang,

15
00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:20,220
we will definitely be involved in the conflict

16
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:22,010
between the Princess and the Crown Prince.

17
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:26,240
I heard that

18
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:28,870
His Majesty wants to be the Taishang Huang, a retired emperor.

19
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,620
It seems

20
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:33,540
that we have to side with the Crown Prince.

21
00:02:33,970 --> 00:02:36,110
Only if the Crown Prince ascends the throne successfully

22
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:39,420
can our dynasty be safe.

23
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:40,670
You are good at investigating cases,

24
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:42,900
but you may not understand the affairs of the court.

25
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,310
If the Emperor abdicates,

26
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:47,460
the fight between the Crown Prince and the Princess

27
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:48,420
can only be more intense.

28
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:50,880
Sacrificing for the country

29
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:52,670
is what I want,

30
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:55,320
but not your dream.

31
00:02:56,290 --> 00:02:56,880
So,

32
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:58,490
you need to think carefully.

33
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:01,930
Only when the country is stable

34
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:04,340
can the people have a happy life.

35
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:07,580
Dongdu.

36
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:10,060
No matter how dangerous it is,

37
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:12,560
as long as it's for the country

38
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:15,110
and for the people of Tang,

39
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:18,990
I will meet the challenge with no regrets.

40
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:20,300
Great.

41
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:22,220
Since you've made up your mind,

42
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:24,750
I'll have no choice but to be with you forever.

43
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:26,180
My disciple.

44
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:26,810
Yes.

45
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:29,290
Would you like to ride with me?

46
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:30,460
Sure.

47
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:44,280
Sworn Brother,

48
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,790
why didn't you ask Yingtao to stay

49
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:47,930
when she bid farewell to us last night?

50
00:03:48,410 --> 00:03:49,500
Why should I?

51
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:51,490
Do I have to take her to Luoyang?

52
00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:56,000
Is it because you think she's wild

53
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:56,930
and doesn't deserve to

54
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:59,000
be with you, the disciple of Detective Di?

55
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,760
What do you mean?

56
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:02,060
It's off the track.

57
00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:04,690
Her father entrusted her to you

58
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:06,380
before he died.

59
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:07,580
It's not off the track.

60
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:09,430
How did you know?

61
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:12,210
Yingtao told me herself.

62
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:13,860
I can see

63
00:04:14,210 --> 00:04:15,710
she has affection for you.

64
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:17,600
It was just her excuse to leave.

65
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:19,380
But you didn't ask her to stay.

66
00:04:19,779 --> 00:04:20,640
She was very sad.

67
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:22,910
Really?

68
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:26,850
Why are you laughing?

69
00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:31,430
But she has left.

70
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:34,550
So you mean

71
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,420
if Yingtao was still here,

72
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:38,070
you would take her to Luoyang, right?

73
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:43,640
If Yingtao spends her life

74
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:44,659
by wandering around the world,

75
00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:47,810
it would be a pity.

76
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:49,490
Sworn Brother,

77
00:04:50,409 --> 00:04:51,380
please tell me.

78
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:52,500
If Yingtao was here,

79
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:54,270
would you take her to north?

80
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:01,940
Sworn Brother, look.

81
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:11,090
Is that Yingtao?

82
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:17,440
Xijun, is it you who...

83
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:31,300
Miss Yingtao is still here.

84
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:35,820
Mr. Su just said

85
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:37,730
if Miss Yingtao didn't leave,

86
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:38,590
he would take you with him

87
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:39,450
to Luoyang.

88
00:05:39,909 --> 00:05:40,460
Xijun.

89
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:41,440
Sworn Brother,

90
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:42,980
you said it yourself.

91
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:50,380
Don't think

92
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:51,180
that I'm waiting here

93
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:52,340
because I want to go with you.

94
00:05:52,970 --> 00:05:53,930
It's just because there's one thing

95
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:54,490
that I forgot to ask you last night.

96
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,360
You have found out the fact that

97
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:57,560
my father pretended to be the prefectural governor,

98
00:05:58,060 --> 00:05:58,780
but you kept it a secret.

99
00:05:59,409 --> 00:06:00,420
Aren't you afraid

100
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:02,330
to be killed for it?

101
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:05,780
I will take the responsibility

102
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:06,940
of hiding it

103
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:09,610
no matter what happens.

104
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,640
The Records of Worshippers of Tuo God your father writes

105
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:16,170
helps Ninghu shake off

106
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,620
the oppression of the Shrine.

107
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:20,530
He deserves to be

108
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:22,460
the Great Prefectural Governor of Tang.

109
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:25,190
Thank you, Mr. Su.

110
00:06:27,850 --> 00:06:28,340
Farewell.

111

112

Yingtao.

114
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:40,030
My horse is a bit old.

115
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:41,110
It can't lift me.

116
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:42,250
I wonder

117
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:44,140
whether I can ride your horse?

118
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:46,590
Will you agree?

119
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:48,140
Change the horse?

120
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:55,180
You are the one who have saved my life.

121
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:56,500
Well,

122
00:06:57,909 --> 00:06:58,470
I'll give it to you.

123
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:06,580
He is too shy to invite you personally,

124
00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:08,160
and even comes up with an idea to change the horse.

125
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:09,890
Now you have to agree.

126
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:11,770
Well,

127
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:13,550
his embarrassment

128
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:15,060
makes me more convinced

129
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:16,070
that he is unique.

130
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:31,760
Luoyang in May

131

and beautiful as a dream.

133
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:38,950
But since ancient times, May has been known as an ominous month,

134
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:41,710
especially today, the fifth day of May,

135
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:43,520
which is also called Double Fifth.

136
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:45,500
There are many taboos.

137
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:48,400
Don't act recklessly.

138
00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:50,080
What ominous month?

139
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:51,520
It's just a bluff.

Dongdu, located by the foot of Mangshan

and the coast of Luoshui,

142
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,540
is the root of our country.

143
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:00,860
Every time I come to Luoyang,

144
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:02,580
I feel uneasy.

145
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:05,450
I would think of the time I spent with Master Di.

146
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:08,640
Maybe that was the happiest time

147
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:10,310
in my life.

What are you thinking about?

150
00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:19,310
You must be familiar with Luoyang, too.

151
00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:22,830
Be it the Tianjin Bridge by the riverside of Luoshui,

152
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:25,220
or the cherry blossom

153

and pomegranates in Dingding Street,

154
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:27,590
I will always remember.

155
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:31,240
Weren't you born in Luoyang, were you?

156
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:33,909
I left when I was five.

157
00:08:37,179 --> 00:08:38,020
Then tell me

158
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:41,380
about your childhood.

159
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:45,840
All I can remember is pain.

160
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:48,620
Happiness is too light

161
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:50,630

00:09:15,310 --> 00:09:17,500
someone has bad intentions towards your master.

Don't look at my master.

Let's go.

00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:12,600
Do you have money?

176
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:15,830
Will you just wipe your mouth and leave after drinking my wine

177
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:17,170
and pay nothing?

178
00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:23,660
Watch your mouth!

179
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:25,420
Do I look poor?

180
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:26,420
Yes.

181
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:27,220
I...

182
00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:28,740
You...

183
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:30,600
You pissed me off.

184
00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:31,950
Do you know who I am?

185
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:32,950
Who are you?

186
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:34,720
I'm the vanguard

187
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:36,640
of Su Wuming, who is going to

188
00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:38,620
be a high-rank official in Dongdu.

189
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:39,670
I don't care who you are.

190
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:40,760
Guards!

191
00:10:41,210 --> 00:10:42,590
See if he has any money.

192
00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:49,270
Don't touch me.

193
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:52,080
Don't touch there.

194
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:56,000
You're really not a beggar.

195
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:56,830
Put me down!

196
00:10:58,900 --> 00:10:59,420
Go.

197
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:01,490
Serve me with wine.

198
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:04,690
Yes, sir.

199
00:11:04,890 --> 00:11:06,110
Serve good wine and dishes.

200
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:06,950
Go to hell!

201
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:09,030
This fan is so beautiful.

202
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:09,830
Isn't it?

203
00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:10,410
Someone gave it to me.

204
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:11,480
Let me see.

205
00:11:11,950 --> 00:11:12,990
What do you think of my rouge?

206
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:14,980
Nice. Where did you buy it?

207
00:11:15,570 --> 00:11:16,180
It's a secret.

208
00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:19,050
Look, I've guessed the answer.

209
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:20,870
Ladies in Luoyang

210
00:11:21,090 --> 00:11:22,170
are so beautiful.

211
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,010
Stop guessing.

212
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:23,420
What?

213
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:24,800
It must be the best rouge.

214
00:11:28,070 --> 00:11:29,400
What's wrong?

215
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:30,750
What happened?

216
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:33,850
What happened?

217
00:11:33,950 --> 00:11:34,560
I don't know.

218

How is it?

219
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:36,610
It's so scary.

220
00:11:36,650 --> 00:11:37,250
Yeah.

221
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:41,180
What happened?

222
00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:42,060
It's all rotten.

223
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:42,820
Yes.

224
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:46,470
It's completely rotten.

225
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:47,460
This is so scary.

226
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:48,610

[Prefectural Governor's Residence]

228

Please report for me.

229
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:58,430
Su Wuming, Commander of Ninghu,

230
00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:00,140
is here to visit Prefectural Governor Gao.

231
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:02,680
The prefectural governor knows

232
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:03,550
that Your Honor, Administor Su, will be here in two days.

233
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:04,750
So he asked me

234
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:06,140
to wait you here for a long time.

235
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:08,160

236
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:09,830
Who is the administrator?

237
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:11,300
It seems you haven't got the information.

238
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:12,860
You have been appointed

239
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,200
the Administrator of Luozhou.

240
00:12:15,930 --> 00:12:17,380
Just as I expected.

241
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:22,760
Wait for me here.

242
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:26,100
Brother Su.

243
00:12:26,490 --> 00:12:27,910
You're finally here.

244
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:30,800
Greetings, Governor Gao.

245
00:12:31,170 --> 00:12:32,800
Have a seat.

246
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,540
This is Mr. Li, Resident Regent of Dongdu.

247
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,320

Li Yue, Resident Regent of Dongdu.

250
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:47,940
Resident Regent Li is extraordinary.

251
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:50,670
His ancestors were loyal to Tang.

252
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:54,360
So they were appointed as imperial officials by Emperor Taizong

253
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:55,370
in Luoyang.

254

The Family of Li has taken root in Luoyang.

255
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:00,970
I'm already a local in Luoyang.

Greetings, Resident Regent Li.

Commander?

259
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:11,160
Governor Gao and I

260
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:13,740
are here to welcome the new administrator of Luozhou.

261
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:18,200
Governor Gao, I don't understand.

262
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:21,220
Why did prefectural governor write a letter

263
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:22,280
to me and ask me to go north

264
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:24,500
in the name of the imperial court?

265
00:13:25,290 --> 00:13:27,540
And why do you all call me

266
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,380
administrator?

267
00:13:29,890 --> 00:13:30,890

268
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:32,750
don't you think

269
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:35,190
I tricked you to come to Luoyang, do you?

270
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:36,750
To transfer you to Luoyang

271
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:39,090
and promote you as the Administrator of Luozhou.

272
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:41,670
are all orders from the Princess, Her Highness.

00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:45,520
Have a seat.

274
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:46,820
Please.

275

Princess and Crown Prince came to Dongdu

276
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:54,180
with His Majesty.

277
00:13:54,570 --> 00:13:56,060
His Majesty returned to Chang'an

278
00:13:56,090 --> 00:13:57,430
a month ago.

279
00:13:57,740 --> 00:13:59,740
The Crown Prince left yesterday.

280
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:02,260
The Princess is sick,

281
00:14:02,530 --> 00:14:04,890
so she stays here temporarily.

282
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:06,880
Just be frank.

283
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:09,470
A hundred days ago,

284
00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:12,160
Face Flower suddenly appeared in Luoyang.

285
00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:14,270
It's used by women for beautifying.

286
00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:15,740
It is said

287
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:19,310
that once you soak it and apply it on your face,

288
00:14:19,950 --> 00:14:22,660
the flower will melt into the skin.

289
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,370
After 81 days,

290
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:28,720
your skin will be as tender as a girl.

291
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:31,110
Although it is expensive,

292
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:33,130
rich ladies in Dongdu

293
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:35,090
still scramble for it.

294
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:38,480
But the users did't expect

295
00:14:39,370 --> 00:14:40,560
that after 81 days,

296
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:43,080
they didn't return to their youth;

297
00:14:43,730 --> 00:14:47,600
rather, their faces turned into skulls.

298
00:14:51,450 --> 00:14:52,460
After entering the city,

299
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:56,150
I saw such a scary thing with my own eye.

300
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:57,890
Again?

301
00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:00,730
The reason why the Princess dispatch you here so urgently

302
00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:04,640
is to ask you to supervise the investigation of the case.

303
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:10,770
Does it mean that the Princess also use the Face Flower?

304
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:13,140
Days counted,

305
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:15,250
her time is almost up.

306
00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:20,200
If we can catch the culprit

307
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:22,220
and get the antidote before that,

308
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:25,350
there is still a chance of survival.

309
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:27,190
Where is Her Highness now?

310
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:28,350
Blessing Temple.

311
00:15:31,710 --> 00:15:32,200
By the way,

312
00:15:32,570 --> 00:15:34,450
don't tell anyone

313
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:37,060
that Her Highness was poisoned by the Face Flower.

314
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:39,540
Otherwise, Luo Yang, Chang'an,

315
00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:41,380
and even the whole Tang

316
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,460
will be in chaos.

317
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:48,330
Speaking of the Face Flower,

318
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:50,630
according to encyclopedia,

319
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:54,110
it is originated in the southwest of the Arab Empire.

320
00:15:54,390 --> 00:15:56,030
It is as thin as cicada wings.

321
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:57,980
It looks like a person with a smile.

322
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,590
There are red marks on the corner of the mouth.

323
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:00,610
I don't expect

324
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:03,470
that this flower

325
00:16:03,490 --> 00:16:05,040
is poisonous like this.

326
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:08,330
Is there any clue about the person who sold this flower?

327
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:10,190
Governor.

328
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:13,190
Resident Regent Li.

329
00:16:16,890 --> 00:16:18,050
The suspect is a woman

330
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:18,990
from Tokhara.

331
00:16:19,290 --> 00:16:21,000
She is in the Paradise Inn.

332
00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:22,920
Great.

He's talking about the flower seller.

335
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:29,160
But after Minister Xing rushed there with his subordinates,

336
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:31,220
the suspect had committed suicide.

337
00:16:31,850 --> 00:16:34,210
Incompetent! Useless! You...

338
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:39,610
It seems that it is wise for Her Highness

339
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:41,860
to dispatch you to Dongdu.

340
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:44,740

00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,410
Although it is an emergency,

348
00:16:58,830 --> 00:17:01,170
I still need the official document

349
00:17:01,210 --> 00:17:02,970
of my appointment.

350
00:17:05,319 --> 00:17:07,109
Here it is,

351
00:17:07,619 --> 00:17:09,349
but it doesn't matter.

352
00:17:09,829 --> 00:17:11,950
Because the oral order of Her Highness

353
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,670
is much more powerful than this.

354
00:17:16,210 --> 00:17:17,300
An informal official?

355
00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:20,369
By giving such an order,

356
00:17:21,089 --> 00:17:23,359
the imperial court hurts its own authority.

357
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:24,450
This...

358
00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:25,920
You may leave.

359
00:17:26,450 --> 00:17:26,980
Yes.

360
00:17:29,710 --> 00:17:30,650
Brother Su,

361
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:33,000
the current situation is very serious.

362
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,310
Her Highness appoints you directly

363
00:17:35,810 --> 00:17:37,990
because she trusts you.

364
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:41,980
Although my rank is not high,

365
00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:45,030
I consider myself upright.

366
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:47,520
With an informal appointment,

367
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:51,090
it's hard for me to take office.

368
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:55,350
You didn't bribe others to get promoted.

369
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:56,280
If there is anything you want,

370
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:58,430
let people in Chang'an

371
00:17:58,450 --> 00:17:59,860
make it up for you.

372
00:18:01,430 --> 00:18:02,530
All right.

373
00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:04,750
Brother Su, you come all the way here.

374
00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:06,470
From the manor outside the city,

375
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:08,280
I bring you

376
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:09,170
Persian wine preserved for years.

377
00:18:09,690 --> 00:18:10,790
Let's treat you to a meal on arriving.

378
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:13,330
Leave the rest aside for the time being.

379
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:16,020
Brother Su,

380
00:18:16,270 --> 00:18:17,620
we want to welcome you.

381
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:19,340
If you wouldn't like to come for my sake,

382
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:21,750
you should at least come for the sake of Resident Regent Li.

383
00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:32,310
Yingtao.

384
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:34,280
Have a look at my sworn brother's new official robe.

385
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:35,690
Doesn't it fit?

386
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:37,780
The color

387
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:39,620
looks nice.

388
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,600
The Administrator of Luozhou is a fifth-rank official.

389
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:44,930
Su Wuming

390
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:46,420
can make a fortune from now.

391
00:18:58,660 --> 00:18:59,710
Where am I?

392
00:19:00,570 --> 00:19:01,830
This is the Administrator's Residence.

393
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,310
Administrator's Residence?

394
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:12,830
Let me think.

395
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:15,060
Yes, it's the Administrator's Residence.

396
00:19:15,930 --> 00:19:16,980
Not far from

397
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:18,080
the back door

398
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:19,070
is the Memorial Temple of Master Di.

399
00:19:19,630 --> 00:19:20,630
You can go there quite often

400
00:19:20,930 --> 00:19:22,010
to visit your master.

401
00:19:25,450 --> 00:19:26,330
Yes.

402
00:19:27,010 --> 00:19:27,720
Yes.

403
00:19:27,910 --> 00:19:28,920
I have to pay respects to my master.

404
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:31,770
I have to.

405
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:37,450
Why am I wearing

406
00:19:37,810 --> 00:19:38,700
this official robe?

407
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,320
You're the Administrator of Luozhou now.

408
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:43,880
You should wear this.

409
00:19:44,210 --> 00:19:45,750
Who put it on me?

410
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,070
It was me.

411
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:49,860
What's wrong?

412
00:19:57,510 --> 00:20:03,320
[Administrator's Residence]

413
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:03,510
Administrator's Residence.

414
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:05,700
Lu Lingfeng.

415
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:09,150
Are you trying to ruin my reputation?

416
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,270
It was sent by someone

417
00:20:11,290 --> 00:20:12,100
from Governor Gao.

418
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:12,900
You drank too much,

419
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:14,460
and vomited on your own clothes.

420
00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:15,830
I kindly

421
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:17,100
changed it for you,

422
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:18,970
but you aren't even grateful to me.

423
00:20:19,210 --> 00:20:20,290
Shut up!

424
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:23,260
The position of the Administrator of Luozhou

425
00:20:23,290 --> 00:20:25,310
is not formally appointed by the imperial court.

426
00:20:25,450 --> 00:20:27,120
It is an informal official.

427
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,870
If I accept it,

428
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:33,040
I'll go against my conscience

429
00:20:33,130 --> 00:20:34,780
and break the rules of being a real man.

430
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:39,290
Su Wuming.

431
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:42,290
Don't pretend to be pure and lofty.

432
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:44,220
You are not sober.

433
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,530
Don't talk nonsense.

434
00:20:46,790 --> 00:20:48,430
Isn't it just an informal position?

435
00:20:48,690 --> 00:20:49,780
I've heard about it.

436
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:51,260
So what?

437
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:52,370
An informal position

438
00:20:52,970 --> 00:20:53,510
is still a position.

439
00:20:53,930 --> 00:20:56,690
Besides, no one dares to look down on you

440
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:58,770
if you are appointed directly by Her Highness.

441
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:00,540
Nonsense.

442
00:21:04,650 --> 00:21:05,730
I know you care about dignity.

443
00:21:07,370 --> 00:21:09,920
Take things as they come.

444
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:12,410
I came a few days earlier than you.

445
00:21:12,830 --> 00:21:14,990
I've figured out the situation.

446
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:17,420
This case

447
00:21:18,290 --> 00:21:20,020
is really strange.

448
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:21,950
Su Wuming,

449
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:24,180
aren't you obsessed with

450
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:25,610
investigating cases like this?

451
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:29,010
Wearing this official robe

452
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:33,140
that I despise to investigate the case

453
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:36,510
is no different from self-destruction.

454
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:38,030
Su Wuming.

455
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:41,250
There are victims dying every day

456
00:21:41,270 --> 00:21:42,550
because of the Face Flower.

457
00:21:42,930 --> 00:21:43,730
At this time,

458
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:44,920
what do you think is more important,

459
00:21:45,330 --> 00:21:46,310
your face or people's life?

460
00:21:48,970 --> 00:21:49,780
Sworn Brother,

461
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:53,130
I think Lu Lingfeng is right.

462
00:21:53,650 --> 00:21:54,450
In my opinion,

463
00:21:54,910 --> 00:21:56,310
those greedy noble women

464
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:57,340
deserve it.

465
00:21:58,060 --> 00:21:59,010
Why do you ruin your reputation

466
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:00,760
for them?

467
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:03,320
Yingtao, you're wrong.

468
00:22:04,430 --> 00:22:06,020
Even if they are delusional,

469
00:22:06,210 --> 00:22:07,480
it's a matter of life and death.

470
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:08,690
Xijun.

471
00:22:09,630 --> 00:22:11,510
I know you're from a noble family.

472
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:12,940
Of course you speak for them.

473
00:22:13,950 --> 00:22:15,540
But I, a wandering woman,

474
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:18,410
can't feel sorry for them at all.

475
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:19,980
Sir.

476
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:22,740
Sir.

477
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:25,340
A man called Xing Ying, Minister of Justice,

478
00:22:25,990 --> 00:22:27,360
wants to meet the administrator.

479
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:28,580
No.

480
00:22:29,230 --> 00:22:31,280
Tell him there's no administrator here.

481
00:22:32,070 --> 00:22:34,720
I, Su Wuming, will not serve as an informal official.

482
00:22:37,150 --> 00:22:38,230
No administrator?

483
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:38,940
Yes.

484
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:40,880
That's what my master said.

485
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:45,670
[Xing Ying, Minister of Justice of Luozhou]

486
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,320
An informal administrator

487
00:22:44,550 --> 00:22:46,200
dares to put on an act.

488
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:48,140
If it isn't for business,

489
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:51,120
how would I come to see him?

490
00:22:51,890 --> 00:22:52,410
Let's go.

491
00:22:53,010 --> 00:22:53,550
Stop!

492
00:22:54,890 --> 00:22:56,460
My master is not putting on airs.

493
00:22:57,170 --> 00:22:58,120
And he said

494
00:22:58,580 --> 00:22:59,570
he wouldn't be an informal official.

495
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:01,490
You can look down upon anyone,

496
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:03,430
but not Mr. Su.

497
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:05,060
He is a tremendous person.

498
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:11,660
He won't be an informal official but he lives in the Administrator's Residence.

499
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:12,810
Who are you lying to?

500
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:21,910
It has been said over the past few years

501
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:24,420
that Su Wuming is good at investigating strange cases

502
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:26,210
and he's virtuous.

503
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:30,850
Maybe I misunderstood him.

504
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:34,170
Ask someone to keep an eye on him. If there's any movement,

505
00:23:34,590 --> 00:23:35,340
report to me at any time.

506
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:36,060
Yes, sir.

507
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:41,530
Xing Ying.

508
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:45,820
You know him?

509
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:48,540
When I was in the Imperial Guards,

510
00:23:49,290 --> 00:23:50,410
a subordinate named Xing Ying

511
00:23:52,530 --> 00:23:53,800
was transferred to Dongdu as an official.

512
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:56,360
I don't expect that

513
00:23:56,530 --> 00:23:57,800
he is the Minister of Justice now.

514
00:23:58,350 --> 00:23:59,740
Why don't you go out and meet him?

515
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:04,340
If he asks me what official I am,

516
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:05,680
what should I say?

517
00:24:06,270 --> 00:24:07,200
That's right.

518
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:08,910

00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:10,900
Combined, it means

694
00:31:11,010 --> 00:31:13,970
you may live a long life naturally.

695
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:15,790
Let's go! Hurry!

696
00:31:18,330 --> 00:31:20,430
I didn't expect your servant

697
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:21,820
was so knowledgeable.

698
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:23,180
Then aren't you

699
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:25,250
even more knowledgeable?

700
00:31:28,450 --> 00:31:31,770
You have a point.

701
00:31:32,370 --> 00:31:34,370
Landlady, you have a good taste.

702
00:31:35,140 --> 00:31:35,770
Master,

703
00:31:36,550 --> 00:31:37,880
it's getting late.

704
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:38,860
How about

705
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:40,970
living here for one night?

706
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:46,340
Alright.

707
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:48,080
Please.

708
00:31:56,340 --> 00:31:58,480
Sir, you can drink downstairs

709
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:00,580
and sleep well upstairs

710
00:32:01,910 --> 00:32:03,860
in my restaurant.

711
00:32:05,870 --> 00:32:08,340
If you think those dancing girls are good,

712
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:09,690
you can also...

713
00:32:10,570 --> 00:32:11,310
What can I do?

714
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:15,190
You can also take them to the guest room to dance with them.

715
00:32:15,490 --> 00:32:16,000
You can also...

716
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:22,950
But I

717
00:32:22,970 --> 00:32:23,780
won't do that,

718
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:25,950
unless

719
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:32,040
your master wants to do that.

720
00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:36,860
Let's take a look at

721
00:32:36,970 --> 00:32:37,890
the guest rooms upstairs first.

722
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:39,730
Guys!

723
00:32:40,170 --> 00:32:41,330
Take the respected guests upstairs.

724
00:32:44,890 --> 00:32:45,540
Please.

725
00:32:53,250 --> 00:32:53,800
So?

726
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:55,470
You like him?

727
00:32:56,630 --> 00:32:58,420
Think about your age.

728
00:33:06,230 --> 00:33:07,960
What do you think? This grande room

729
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:09,840
is enough for both of you.

730
00:33:10,630 --> 00:33:12,050
How can I

731
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:12,820
live with my servant?

732
00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:13,650
You're right.

733
00:33:14,010 --> 00:33:15,810
How can I live with my master?

734
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:17,060
We need two rooms.

735
00:33:17,250 --> 00:33:18,230
But there's no more room.

736
00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:19,660
Is someone

737
00:33:20,250 --> 00:33:20,960
living in this room?

738
00:33:27,870 --> 00:33:28,660
How is it?

739
00:33:29,210 --> 00:33:30,340
I'm not lying, am I?

740
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:32,550
There are guests inside.

741
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:34,700
There's only one room left

742
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:36,450
upstairs.

743
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:39,520
You mean

744
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:41,620
there are guest rooms downstairs?

745
00:33:42,030 --> 00:33:43,390
There is a tavern downstairs.

746
00:33:43,770 --> 00:33:45,020
There are a few rooms in the backyard

747
00:33:45,630 --> 00:33:47,560
occupied by long-term tenants.

748
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:49,090
So there is no room left, either.

749
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:50,760
There's one more room.

750
00:33:51,650 --> 00:33:52,840
But you can't live there.

751
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:53,990
Why?

752
00:33:54,420 --> 00:33:55,970
Because someone died there.

753
00:33:57,970 --> 00:33:59,080
I knew it was ominous here.

754
00:33:59,330 --> 00:34:00,050
You insisted on living here.

755
00:34:00,930 --> 00:34:02,100
Master, calm down.

756
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:03,760
Who died?

757
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:04,860
Did the deceased

758
00:34:05,020 --> 00:34:06,620
die in this inn?

759
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:07,420
Yes.

760
00:34:07,830 --> 00:34:09,290
Haven't there been rumors

761
00:34:09,310 --> 00:34:10,909
about Face Flowers killing people?

762
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:12,699
A lot of officials

763
00:34:12,730 --> 00:34:13,780
suddenly came here today.

764
00:34:14,330 --> 00:34:15,620
They said the Face Flower seller

765
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:17,150
was the Tocharian woman

766
00:34:17,179 --> 00:34:18,880
living in our inn.

767
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:20,560
How can you let

768
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:21,500
such a principal criminal

769
00:34:21,530 --> 00:34:22,380
live here?

770
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:23,590
I didn't know

771
00:34:23,620 --> 00:34:24,530
she was a bad person at that time.

772
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:26,130
Until today,

773
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:27,179
the government officials

774
00:34:27,179 --> 00:34:28,420
surrounded the inn.

775
00:34:28,739 --> 00:34:29,969
When Minister Xing

776
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,520
rushed into the room with his men,

777
00:34:31,650 --> 00:34:32,820
that Tocharian woman

778
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:34,820
had committed suicide by taking poison.

779
00:34:38,659 --> 00:34:39,570
My servant

780
00:34:39,889 --> 00:34:40,659
has strong Yangqi.

781
00:34:41,050 --> 00:34:42,139
He's not afraid of a room in which someone died.

782
00:34:42,510 --> 00:34:45,000
But the body is still there.

783
00:34:45,380 --> 00:34:46,770
Why didn't you take the body away?

784
00:34:48,030 --> 00:34:48,770
I see.

785
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:51,210
Isn't today the fifth day of the fifth lunar month?

786
00:34:51,409 --> 00:34:52,620
There is a saying among the people

787
00:34:52,889 --> 00:34:54,639
that they can't see blood

788
00:34:54,670 --> 00:34:55,469
or move the body today.

789
00:34:55,780 --> 00:34:56,460
Yes.

790
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:58,690
Minister Xing also said so.

791
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:00,290
So they'll take the body away

792
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:02,210
tomorrow.

793
00:35:03,170 --> 00:35:04,360
How could you believe such nonsense?

794
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:05,800
I'll pay twice as much.

795
00:35:05,910 --> 00:35:06,620
My servant

796
00:35:07,190 --> 00:35:08,200
will defenitely live in that room.

797
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:09,820
This...

798
00:35:10,270 --> 00:35:10,770
Pay out.

799
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:14,780
Listen.

800
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:17,460
My master has a bad temper.

801
00:35:17,630 --> 00:35:19,620
If you make him angry, you'll be in big trouble.

802
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:21,110
Besides, we'll just stay here for one night.

803
00:35:21,140 --> 00:35:23,030
How would Minister Xing know if you don't tell him?

804
00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:25,710
And we will give you money. Here.

805
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:27,020
No.

806
00:35:27,590 --> 00:35:29,030
The body is still in bed.

807
00:35:29,180 --> 00:35:30,150
I'm not afraid.

808
00:35:30,170 --> 00:35:31,050
No way.

809
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:32,530
She is a key criminal.

810
00:35:32,930 --> 00:35:34,960
Minister Xing has locked the door.

811
00:35:35,630 --> 00:35:36,060
Brother.

812
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:36,630
Stop!

813
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:37,720
This is the only room.

814
00:35:37,990 --> 00:35:39,130
Live or leave.

815
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:50,920
So you got the news early

816
00:35:51,490 --> 00:35:52,990
and deliberately found the Paradise Inn.

817
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:58,100
I wanted to search

818
00:35:58,130 --> 00:35:59,500
the inn to see

819
00:35:59,630 --> 00:36:02,710
if there would be any unexpected gains.

820
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:05,900
I didn't expect

821
00:36:05,930 --> 00:36:07,760
the body of that Tocharian woman

822
00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:09,610
was still in this inn.

823
00:36:11,530 --> 00:36:11,900
By the way,

824
00:36:13,290 --> 00:36:14,630
someone followed us

825
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:16,550
along the way.

826
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:18,550
He didn't seem to be malicious.

827
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:20,060
He didn't look like a bad person, either.

828
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:21,810
It seemed that

829
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:23,830
they might be sent by the local government.

830
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:27,120
Did Xing Ying send them?

831
00:36:28,950 --> 00:36:29,900
Follow us?

832
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:34,260
The body of the Tocharian woman

833
00:36:34,290 --> 00:36:35,580
is still in this inn.

834
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:37,240
He didn't send his men to guard the body

835
00:36:37,730 --> 00:36:39,740
but follow us.

836
00:36:43,110 --> 00:36:45,370
What does Xing Ying mean?

837
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:46,860
Who knows?

838
00:37:02,570 --> 00:37:04,710
When it gets dark, find a rope

839
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:06,060
to put me down from here.

840
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:09,090
You want to do an autopsy?

841
00:37:09,340 --> 00:37:10,780
Not only that.

842
00:37:10,940 --> 00:37:12,300
Didn't that big guy

843
00:37:12,330 --> 00:37:13,050
say

844
00:37:13,180 --> 00:37:15,380
the Tocharian woman lived here often.

845
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:17,620
We should be able to find something in her room.

846
00:37:21,620 --> 00:37:23,110
After you put me down,

847
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:24,570
go find the woman shopkeeper

848
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:25,670
and drink with her.

849
00:37:26,090 --> 00:37:26,620
What?

850
00:37:27,170 --> 00:37:27,630
I'm not going.

851
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:29,800
I'm not asking for your opinion.

852
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:31,700
You really take yourself as my master?

853
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:33,390
I order you to go.

854
00:37:40,250 --> 00:37:40,910
Forget it.

855
00:37:42,780 --> 00:37:44,140
Anyway, the woman shopkeeper

856
00:37:45,730 --> 00:37:46,770
doesn't like you.

857
00:37:47,490 --> 00:37:47,890
You...

858
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:02,960
Minister,

859
00:38:03,370 --> 00:38:04,580
Su Wuming left the Administrator's Residence

860
00:38:04,710 --> 00:38:05,580
with a subordinate.

861
00:38:08,010 --> 00:38:08,990
It seems that Su Wuming

862
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:10,030
refused to be the administrator.

863
00:38:10,420 --> 00:38:11,890
So he took his man to look for an inn to live.

864
00:38:13,630 --> 00:38:14,550
In that case,

865
00:38:14,910 --> 00:38:16,670
he has integrity.

866
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:18,060
But

867
00:38:19,810 --> 00:38:21,330
they went to the Paradise Inn.

868
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:22,050
What?

869
00:38:23,740 --> 00:38:24,260
Let's go.

870
00:38:41,660 --> 00:38:42,300
Sir,

871
00:38:42,530 --> 00:38:43,810
I've heard about the delicious food and wine

872
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:45,090
of the Paradise Inn for a long time.

873
00:38:45,650 --> 00:38:46,460
And the Persian beauties

874
00:38:46,460 --> 00:38:47,420
are also very charming.

875
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:49,670
It's my treat tonight. Let's get drunk.

876
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:50,140
Okay.

877
00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:31,300
Fill it up.

878
00:39:38,770 --> 00:39:39,490
Good wine. Come on.

879
00:39:39,530 --> 00:39:40,730
Come on. Drink!

880
00:39:47,140 --> 00:39:47,900
Yes.

881
00:39:48,060 --> 00:39:48,720
Look at this dish.

882
00:39:50,050 --> 00:39:51,230
I've tried it.

883
00:39:51,260 --> 00:39:52,270
Cheers.

884
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:07,430
What do you want?

885
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:09,280
Go away.

886
00:40:19,590 --> 00:40:20,840
Couldn't you sleep?

887
00:40:25,370 --> 00:40:26,500
Young lady.

888
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:28,250
You didn't drink with us just now,

889
00:40:28,610 --> 00:40:30,160
but now you're pouring wine for others.

890
00:40:30,580 --> 00:40:31,530
Why?

891
00:40:31,970 --> 00:40:32,550
Yes.

892
00:40:32,850 --> 00:40:34,360
He's quite lucky.

893
00:40:35,620 --> 00:40:36,610
I took a fancy to him

894
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:37,950
when he passed by in the daytime.

895
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:38,740
What's wrong?

896
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:40,070
Your husband

897
00:40:40,770 --> 00:40:41,900
is here.

898
00:40:41,930 --> 00:40:44,020
My husband loves me.

899
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:46,130
He doesn't care

900
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:47,790
if I have someone I like.

901
00:40:49,130 --> 00:40:49,650
W...

902
00:40:50,530 --> 00:40:51,900
What?

903
00:40:52,530 --> 00:40:54,590
Don't be afraid. He's short.

904
00:40:55,450 --> 00:40:56,690
He can't see anything.

905
00:40:58,730 --> 00:41:01,000
This is the best wine.

906
00:41:01,420 --> 00:41:04,150
The pure Gaochang wine.

907
00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:08,260
Play another piece! Play another piece!

908
00:41:08,370 --> 00:41:09,010
Great!

909
00:41:09,030 --> 00:41:09,950
Nice! Nice!

910
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:11,970
Yeah.

911
00:41:12,180 --> 00:41:13,580
This song should only be played in Heaven.

912
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:16,480
How should I address you?

913
00:41:17,490 --> 00:41:18,260
Lady Hu...

914
00:41:18,620 --> 00:41:19,780
Cheers! Cheers!

915
00:41:22,770 --> 00:41:24,400
Shisi.

916
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:02,970
Why do your customers

917
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:04,490
look

918
00:42:05,010 --> 00:42:06,450
so strange?

919
00:42:07,230 --> 00:42:08,620
Why do you say so?

920
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:10,800
Drink it.

921
00:42:11,630 --> 00:42:14,330
The yinqi in your inn is too heavy.

922
00:42:22,410 --> 00:42:23,700
Play another piece!

923
00:42:23,810 --> 00:42:24,410
Great!

924
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:25,470
Nice! Nice!

925
00:42:27,950 --> 00:42:28,940
I think

926
00:42:30,780 --> 00:42:32,190
you are full of yangqi.

927
00:42:33,830 --> 00:42:35,320
I can't help

928
00:42:37,300 --> 00:42:39,240
taking a breath to get your yangqi.

929
00:42:52,860 --> 00:42:56,970
♫The storm rises with no reason♫

930
00:42:57,620 --> 00:43:00,000
♫In the night of illusions♫

931
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:03,350
♫I go into the maze♫

932

♫In a world of prosperity♫

933
00:43:11,390 --> 00:43:13,410
♫A heart burns with obsession♫

♫It's because of justice♫

938

♫I'll tell the story of the fate♫
