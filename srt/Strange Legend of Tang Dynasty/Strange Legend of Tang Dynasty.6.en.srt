You're awake.

00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:39,320
Xiao.

9
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:43,460
My darling is still alive.

10
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:46,940
He saved me.

11
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:53,120
Yes,

12
00:02:54,010 --> 00:02:54,579
alive.

13
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:59,290
However the Xiao in your mouth

14
00:03:00,170 --> 00:03:01,940
is not Minister Xiao's son,

15
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:03,270

General Xiao

died in battle in the Western Region.

20
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:13,850
The man you love

21
00:03:14,210 --> 00:03:15,900
is the General of the Imperial Guards,

22
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,320
Lu Lingfeng.

23
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:24,610

Since you've survived this doom,

26
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:31,910
from now on,

27
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:35,000
don't be obsessed with your Xiao anymore.

00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:43,860
I want to see him.

31
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:45,720
I want to ask him

32
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:46,540
about the truth.

33
00:03:47,579 --> 00:03:48,240
Listen to me.

34
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:52,090
I'm afraid it's difficult to see him.

35
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:53,840
Where is General Lu?

36
00:03:58,150 --> 00:03:59,710
He was imprisoned in the Imperial Prison.

Regimental commander Wei.

44
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:43,290
I arrived first.

45
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,940
There is no order of arrival, when it comes to this matter.

46
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:48,620
Her Highness always

47
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:50,100
must immediately see the perosn

48
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:52,370

I'm following His Highness' order.

52
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:03,510
Am I not following Her Highness' order?

53

-The Royal Steward of the Eastern Palace, Bai Shan.  -The Regimental Commander in the Princess' Palace, Wei Fenghua.

60
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:31,260
are you mistaken?

61

The person Her Highness wishes to see

62
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:35,250
must be Sheriff Su.

63
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:37,690
What I received is the verbal instruction from Her Highness.

64
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:38,780
It can't be wrong.

65
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,800
I'm not deaf.

66
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:44,000
The person Her Highness wishes to see is you.

67
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,240
Did His Highness

68
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,420
not ask about me?

69
00:05:56,409 --> 00:05:57,050

70

His Highness wants to see you.

71

Please take a bath and change.

Why should I have to wear something like this?

75
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:25,660
I'm not used to it.

76
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,860
But with your clothes stained by blood,

77
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:29,020
if you scare the Princess,

78

Yes.

I'm lucky to follow him for years.

85
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:22,820
No wonder.

86
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,260
The black tea has been causing a disaster in Chang'an for a year.

87
00:07:29,770 --> 00:07:31,650
Many officials were killed by it.

88

Sheriff Su can solve the case

89

90

It is not easy.

91
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:38,430
I will submit to His Majesty

92
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:39,450
to seek credit for you.

about the case

95
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:46,100
I can take all the credit.

96
00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:48,020
The primary credit belongs to

97
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:49,130
the General of the Imperial Guards, Lu Lingfeng

98
00:07:49,890 --> 00:07:50,630
Lu Lingfeng?

99

When the truth was about to be revealed,

100
00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:57,159
he killed the real culprit, Yuan Lai.

101
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:58,580
That Yuan Lai died,

102
00:07:58,950 --> 00:08:00,050
I'm afraid this case

103
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:00,870
can never be solved.

104
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:02,840
He is so reckless.

105
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:04,410
What does he get credit for?

106
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:05,380
Your Highness.

107
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:06,870
At that time,

108
00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:07,970
I was in the Underground Palace.

109
00:08:08,010 --> 00:08:09,380
-Please allow me to explain... -Enough.

110
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:10,500
You may leave.

111
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:14,130
Yes.

112
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:34,740

Raise your head.

Stand up.

118
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:22,880
Turn.

119
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:28,170
Your Highness asks you to turn around.

120
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:45,040
Alike.

121
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:47,650
So alike.

122
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:53,910
Come and take a closer look at me.

123
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:56,030
Have you seen me

124
00:09:56,890 --> 00:09:58,280
when you were little?

125
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:03,120
Your Highness,

126
00:10:03,530 --> 00:10:04,070
no.

127
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:07,630
That can be right.

128

You're 23 this year?

00:10:14,810 --> 00:10:16,570
I'm 25.

131
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,590
Your age doesn't match.

132
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:23,440
How can there be such a coincidence?

133
00:10:24,610 --> 00:10:25,680
What does Your Highness want?

134
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:27,040
I don't understand.

135
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,000
I heard that you killed

136
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,600
the Ghost Four all by yourself.

137
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:33,230
When these four monsters

138
00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:35,230
caused chaos in the capital,

139
00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:37,050
there were thousands of soldiers

140
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:38,070
who couldn't deal with them.

141
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:41,100
You are so great.

142
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:44,100
Your Highness,

I

144
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:47,250
did get lucky to kill the Ghost Four.

145
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,170
But it wasn't me against them four.

146
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:52,000
There were many helpers.

147

Come here.

148
00:10:55,930 --> 00:10:57,220
I'd like to offer you a cup of tea.

00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:03,260
Yes.

150
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:18,090
Come to my side.

151
00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:21,400
Yes.

152

Drink the tea.

158

I can't drink this tea.

159

Why not?

160
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:43,330
Didn't you say I was addicted to it?

161
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:45,730
And I couldn't live without drinking it every day?

162
00:11:46,190 --> 00:11:46,690
I...

163
00:11:49,130 --> 00:11:49,730
I didn't...

164
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:51,300
It's not what I said.

165
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:54,860
My words spread

166
00:11:54,970 --> 00:11:56,820
and got twisted.

167
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,320
I don't mind the rumor.

168
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:01,310
But you must

169
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:03,850
drink the tea today.

170

Forgive me for not obeying your order.

171
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:11,020
What?

172
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:13,820
Do you want me to feed you?

173
00:12:14,930 --> 00:12:15,670
General of the Imperial Guards,

174
00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:18,710
if I feed you, will you drink it

175
00:12:19,010 --> 00:12:20,770
or not?

176
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:24,700
Your family in Fanyang

177
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:26,170
are all so arrogant like you.

178
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:28,170
You look down on me.

179
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,640
This tea has no smell of blood.

180
00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:01,770
Your Highness,

181
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:03,520
this is not the Chang'an black tea.

182
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:06,270
This is from His Majesty.

183
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:07,810
Could it be fake?

184
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:08,940
But

185
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:11,830
this is the real Chang'an black tea.

186
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:13,350
That thing Yuan Lai

187
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:16,070
made by the bride's blood

188
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:17,310
and the Hades Grass

189
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:18,460
is fake.

190
00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:20,870
He even swindled around

191
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:22,680
in my name.

192
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:24,610
And you actually bought it?

193
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:28,230
I'm so sad.

194
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:34,360
Your Highness,

195
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:36,840
I indeed believed the rumor.

196
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:38,410
Please,

197
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:40,270
please punish me.

198
00:13:41,890 --> 00:13:44,450
I heard you were imprisoned.

199
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:46,660
You killed the culprit

200
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:47,740
and made great contributions

201
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:49,410
but ended up being thrown in jail.

202
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:51,920
You are pity.

203
00:13:52,450 --> 00:13:53,250
Get up.

204
00:13:55,830 --> 00:13:56,390
Today,

205
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:59,090
I will reward General Lu properly.

206
00:13:59,260 --> 00:13:59,820
Yes.

207
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:15,620
The black tea from the Princess's Palace

208
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:18,230
is not the evil tea made by Yuan Lai.

209
00:14:20,510 --> 00:14:22,160
I misunderstood her before.

210
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:28,520
The golden cup in the Eastern Palace is beautiful and gorgeous,

211
00:14:28,950 --> 00:14:31,760
but not for guests.

212
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:34,950
Did His Highness invite you to drink?

213
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:39,060
No.

214
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:41,820
That's why

215
00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:43,370
I am starving.

216
00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:45,300
What did His Highness

217
00:14:45,330 --> 00:14:46,090
say to you?

218
00:14:47,610 --> 00:14:48,380
Did he ask about me?

219
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:52,260
His Highness said a lot,

220
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:55,900
but he never mentioned you.

221
00:14:58,580 --> 00:15:00,950
The Regimental Commander Wei in the Princess's Palace is here.

222
00:15:06,690 --> 00:15:08,030
By Princess's written instruction,

223
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:10,450
the General of the Imperial Guards, Lu Lingfeng,

224
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:12,540
killed the bandits bravely.

225
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:13,970
What's wrong with that?

226
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:17,290
Release him immediately

227
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,020
and reward him according to his merits.

228
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:26,260
General, you should thank Her Highness.

229
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:31,280
Regimental Commander Wei,

230
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:33,560
I have a question.

231
00:15:34,690 --> 00:15:36,500
The Imperial Prison is under the jurisdiction of the Imperial Guards.

232
00:15:37,610 --> 00:15:38,880
Her Highness's written instruction...

233
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:39,480
What?

234
00:15:40,130 --> 00:15:40,940
You mean

235
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:43,980
Her Highness can't control the Imperial Guards?

236
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:45,860
That's not what I meant.

237
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:47,190
But Regimental Commander Wei,

238
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:49,400
the Imperial Guards have their own rules.

239
00:15:50,430 --> 00:15:52,300
You are a member from the Lu family of Fanyang.

240
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:53,640
How arrogant.

241
00:15:54,310 --> 00:15:55,790
I'm just a regimental commander.

242
00:15:56,170 --> 00:15:57,110
I dare not comment on

243
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:59,150
what you said just now.

244
00:15:59,590 --> 00:16:00,800
But I have to report back your every word

245
00:16:01,010 --> 00:16:02,450
to Her Highness.

246
00:16:02,610 --> 00:16:04,070
This is my duty.

247
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:05,780
Goodbye.

248
00:16:16,090 --> 00:16:16,790
Assistant Minister.

249
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:19,630
This is the prescription I asked the Imperial Physician Guo for.

250
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:21,070
It's very effective to calm the nerves.

251
00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:22,480
Divide it into ten doses.

252
00:16:22,770 --> 00:16:24,730
Each dose takes three times of decoction

253
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:26,020
and let the Miss take it.

254
00:16:26,850 --> 00:16:27,540
Yes.

255
00:16:29,970 --> 00:16:30,550
Assistant Minister,

256
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:31,940
what are you...

257
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:33,540
I'm going to check on Xijun.

258
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:35,690
My lady, my lady...

259
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:39,220
What's wrong with her?

260
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:40,220
Why are you stuttering?

261
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:42,180
Miss is not at home.

262
00:16:42,570 --> 00:16:44,260
Didn't I tell you to keep an eye on her?

263
00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:45,710
Don't let her run around!

264
00:16:46,190 --> 00:16:47,630
We did guard the door,

265
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:49,450
but she left through the window.

266
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,200
And that Xue Huan.

267
00:16:51,570 --> 00:16:52,670
Who is Xue Huan?

268
00:16:52,770 --> 00:16:53,570
The little servant

269
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:54,940
you bought a few years ago.

270
00:16:55,010 --> 00:16:55,710
Early in the morning

271
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:57,210
I saw Xue Huan harness the horse.

272
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:58,080
I didn't take it seriously.

273
00:16:58,340 --> 00:16:59,600
Until when I sent lunch to my lady,

274
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:01,100
I realized that my lady had jumped out of the window

275
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:03,020
and run away.

276
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:04,460
Xue Huan harnessed the horse to a carriage,

277
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:06,440
which had to be ordered by Miss.

278
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:35,750
[Pei's family servant, Xue Huan]

279
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:33,910
My lady,

280
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:35,680
you are really a fortune teller.

281
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:36,980
The person we are waiting for

282
00:17:37,010 --> 00:17:37,890
is really here.

283
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:48,140
I'm Xue Huan.

284
00:17:48,370 --> 00:17:49,380
Greetings, General of the Imperial Guards.

285
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:51,580
I don't know you.

286
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:52,870
You don't need to know me.

287
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:54,750
Knowing my lady would be enough.

288
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:55,780
General of the Imperial Guards,

289
00:17:56,170 --> 00:17:56,930
please get in.

290
00:17:58,490 --> 00:18:00,250
My lady wants to catch up with you.

291
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:01,740
It's not far,

292
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:03,060
just two blocks away.

293
00:18:04,310 --> 00:18:05,210
Your lady...

294
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:06,730
Your lady can't

295
00:18:06,770 --> 00:18:07,930
be my old friend.

296
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:09,220
You must have mistaken me for someone else.

297
00:18:10,810 --> 00:18:12,250
You are so forgetful.

298
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:14,990
If you hadn't risked your life to save me last night,

299
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:17,180
I would have been killed by that evil man.

300
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,870
Why have you forgotten me overnight?

301
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:22,980
I...

302
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:27,130
I have important business to attend to.

303
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:28,380
I shall take my leave.

304
00:18:29,450 --> 00:18:30,360
Please wait.

305
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:38,210
I, Pei Xijun,

306
00:18:38,730 --> 00:18:40,490
thank you for saving my life.

307
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:43,100
It's my duty.

308
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:44,080
You're welcome.

309
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:45,060
Goodbye.

310
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:47,010
Stop!

311
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:54,030
You are...

312
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:56,830
My lady

313
00:18:56,860 --> 00:18:58,150
has been waiting for you for four hours.

314
00:18:58,410 --> 00:18:59,820
She is kind enough to hold a banquet for you.

315
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:01,620
Why are you being so ungrateful?

316
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:03,010
I'll teach you a lesson

317
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:03,600
for my lady.

318
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:05,300
I didn't expect you to be a hero.

319
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:08,080
I do have something important to do.

320
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:10,720
I'll learn the lesson from you some other day.

321
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:21,040
Xue Huan,

322
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:23,150
you're no match for him.

323
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:27,690
Since you have something important to do,

324
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:29,020
I wouldn't dare to stop you.

325
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:31,770
Besides,

326
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:33,210
we don't need to rush

327
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:35,030
since we have a lifetime together.

328
00:19:35,530 --> 00:19:36,350
I can wait for you.

329
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:37,690
When you're done,

330
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:39,350
no matter what time it is,

331
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:40,880
please

332
00:19:41,010 --> 00:19:42,190
give me a chance.

333
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:43,420
At the place

334
00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:44,260
we first met,

335
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:45,630
I've prepared the wine and food.

336
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:47,510
I don't mean anything else.

337
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:50,330
I just want to propose a toast to you

338
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:52,000
to express my gratitude.

339
00:19:59,220 --> 00:19:59,940
General of the Imperial Guards,

340
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:01,850
His Highness is busy today.

341
00:20:02,010 --> 00:20:02,810
He has no time to see you.

342
00:20:03,090 --> 00:20:04,930
Why don't you come another day?

343
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:08,350
There's something you don't know.

344
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:09,340
I

345
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:10,900
was ordered by His Highness

346
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:12,790
to secretly investigate the case of the black tea in Chang'an.

347
00:20:13,430 --> 00:20:13,970
So,

348
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:16,290
please inform him that I'm here.

349
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:19,400
Okay.

350
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:43,330
Su Wuming.

351
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:47,720
Her Highness has ordered...

352
00:20:48,090 --> 00:20:49,270
to let you go with me.

353
00:20:51,570 --> 00:20:53,230
Who are you?

354
00:20:53,410 --> 00:20:54,130
Su Wuming.

355
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:56,090
You're so forgetful.

356
00:20:56,620 --> 00:20:58,240
Six months ago,

357
00:20:58,270 --> 00:20:58,990
Her Highness lost her spice casket when she was visiting Wugong County

358
00:20:59,010 --> 00:20:59,750
and asked you to investigate the case.

359
00:21:00,130 --> 00:21:02,090
Wasn't I the one who sent you the message?

360
00:21:03,170 --> 00:21:04,030
Now,

361
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:05,850
you solve the case of Chang'an black tea,

362
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:07,260
thinking of promoting,

363
00:21:07,730 --> 00:21:09,550
and forget about me.

364
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:11,980
Regimental commander Wei.

365
00:21:12,390 --> 00:21:13,450
It's really you.

366
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:17,300
I am old and can't see clearly

367
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:18,460
and didn't recognize you.

368
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:19,610
Please, don't be angry.

369
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:22,980
Come with me.

370
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:27,620
His Highness has gone back to his chamber to rest.

371
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:28,780
General of the Imperial Guards,

372
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:30,260
don't wait here any longer.

373
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:31,900
Does Your Highness

374
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:33,500
know I'm waiting here?

375
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:35,340
Yes.

376
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:35,990
Then...

377
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:37,670
Then why didn't he see me?

378
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:38,890
General of the Imperial Guards,

379
00:21:39,350 --> 00:21:40,380
if you ask so,

380
00:21:40,930 --> 00:21:42,480
you will put me in a difficult position.

381
00:21:59,410 --> 00:21:59,870
Wait.

382
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:01,530
Give me the wine.

383
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:03,820
Sir,

384
00:22:04,110 --> 00:22:05,230
it's curfew soon.

385
00:22:05,310 --> 00:22:07,110
I can't sell you wine.

386
00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:09,590
I am the General of the Imperial Guards.

387
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:11,160
I allow you to sell wine to me.

388
00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:12,120
This...

389
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:14,700
General of the Imperial Guards wants to have a drink.

390
00:22:15,390 --> 00:22:15,990
But how could he forget

391
00:22:16,010 --> 00:22:17,280
my lady's invitation?

392
00:22:37,570 --> 00:22:38,820
How do you know I want to drink?

393
00:22:39,870 --> 00:22:41,310
My lady is a fortune teller.

394
00:22:41,730 --> 00:22:42,920
She knew you wouldn't come.

395
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:44,950
So she asked me to follow you.

396
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:46,000
Leave us.

397
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:52,850
Here is a toast

398
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:54,580
to you! Hero!

399
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:58,440
I'm not a hero.

400
00:22:58,890 --> 00:22:59,640
And I don't need a toast.

401
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:02,520
I just want to drink today.

402
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:04,920
Thank you, Miss.

403
00:23:12,690 --> 00:23:13,120
OK.

404
00:23:14,110 --> 00:23:15,210
If General wants to drink,

405
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:16,500
take your time.

406
00:23:17,190 --> 00:23:18,130
I'll play Chinese zither to entertain you.

407
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:02,320
All of you, leave.

408
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:20,980
Greetings, Your Highness.

409
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:28,050
For more than two hours,

410
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:30,040
I seem to

411
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:31,850
have entered the fairyland.

412
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:33,460
I'm full of food and drink,

413
00:24:33,490 --> 00:24:34,330
and perfectly content now.

414
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:37,300
Thank you for your hospitality, Your Highness.

415
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:39,360
How dare you!

416
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:44,770
I don't know what I've done wrong.

417
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,250
Please tell me, Your Highness.

418
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:47,500
Black tea misled the public.

419
00:24:48,140 --> 00:24:49,820
Rumors spread in Chang'an City.

420
00:24:50,130 --> 00:24:51,360
They were all about me.

421
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:53,300
Since you were in charge of investigating into this case,

422
00:24:53,330 --> 00:24:55,330
why didn't you clear my name first?

423
00:24:56,860 --> 00:24:57,390
I...

424
00:24:57,420 --> 00:25:00,020
You were just a sheriff of Wugong County.

425
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:00,620
Without me,

426
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:02,420
would you be able to come to the capital?

427
00:25:03,270 --> 00:25:03,860
So?

428
00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:06,350
Detective Di only taught you how to solve cases.

429
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:08,840
Didn't he teach you

430
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:09,520
to be grateful?

431
00:25:11,950 --> 00:25:15,710
I'm just a lowly official. My words carry no weigh.

432
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:18,130
Besides, the black tea case

433
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:19,610
has already exceeded

434
00:25:19,630 --> 00:25:21,510
the authority of a Chang'an sheriff.

435
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:22,340
What's more,

436
00:25:24,790 --> 00:25:27,100
rumors stop at the wise.

437
00:25:27,430 --> 00:25:29,190
Those who can become officials

438
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:31,510
are all intelligent and modest men.

439
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:32,910
Who would

440
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:34,670
believe

441
00:25:34,790 --> 00:25:37,060
that the evil tea is related to Your Highness?

442
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:39,660
You are eloquent.

443
00:25:40,770 --> 00:25:42,080
His Majesty has ordered the Supreme Court

444
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:42,960
to take over the case.

445
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,560
In order not to arouse panic in the court,

446
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:47,060
the case will not be made public.

447
00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:49,190
As for the Chang'an black tea,

448
00:25:50,150 --> 00:25:52,160
no one is allowed to drink it anymore,

449
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:55,830
and people who were addicted won't be blamed.

450
00:25:57,910 --> 00:25:58,910
Su Wuming.

451
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:01,800
What do you think about this?

452
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:04,720
His Majesty is wise.

453
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:09,810
There is a man named Wen Chao,

454
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:11,860
Minister of the Household,

455
00:26:12,670 --> 00:26:14,060
seems to be involved.

456
00:26:14,370 --> 00:26:16,580
This morning, someone found

457
00:26:16,730 --> 00:26:18,690
that he hung himself at home.

458
00:26:19,730 --> 00:26:21,010
Really?

459
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:22,130
I think

460
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:26,120
it's more like a murder.

461
00:26:27,310 --> 00:26:28,150
Unfortunately,

462
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:30,520
His Majesty has decreed to stop investigating.

463
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:31,940
I am not the one

464
00:26:31,970 --> 00:26:33,160
to take care of this thing.

465
00:26:34,110 --> 00:26:35,830
So I won't worry about it.

466
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:38,110
Yuan Lai is dead.

467
00:26:38,970 --> 00:26:40,730
Although he is just a county magistrate,

468
00:26:41,330 --> 00:26:43,430
he's still a magistrate in Chang'an City.

469
00:26:43,970 --> 00:26:46,290
It's a fifth-rank official, an important position in the capital.

470
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:47,880
It seems that many people

471
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:49,700
have started to compete for that.

472
00:26:50,370 --> 00:26:51,130
Su Wuming.

473
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:54,050
Do you want this position?

474
00:26:54,550 --> 00:26:56,790
If you do, I'll get it for you.

475
00:26:57,340 --> 00:26:59,410
After all, it's me who summoned you to the capital.

476
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:02,690
So, you will work for me in the future,

477
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:04,330
right?

478
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:16,700
Or,

479
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:20,390
you don't want to work for me in the future?

480
00:27:23,210 --> 00:27:24,560
Working for Your Highness

481
00:27:24,580 --> 00:27:26,160
is to serve the court.

482
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:27,390
I will do my best

483
00:27:27,430 --> 00:27:29,270
to serve the court

484
00:27:29,310 --> 00:27:30,340
until my dying day.

485
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,010
What a slippery man!

486
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:36,230
Go on drinking.

487
00:27:36,970 --> 00:27:38,780
Ask Sheriff Su

488
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:40,480
to drink all the wine in the feast.

489
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:42,390
If you don't get drunk once,

490
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:44,590
I'm afraid you'll never

491
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:46,150
figure out some things in your life.

492
00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:07,980
Where are you

493
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:09,190
carrying me?

494
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:11,140
Her Highness has given us the order

495
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:12,580
to take you back

496
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:13,700
wherever we pick you up.

497
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:03,470
Don't run!

498
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:05,500
Stop!

499
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:13,020
Who dares

500
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:13,830
to break the night curfew?

501
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:17,170
Are you blind?

502
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:18,950
I'm your general.

503
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:20,330
What...

504
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:36,590
Stop! Who's there?

505
00:29:37,190 --> 00:29:37,660
After him!

506
00:29:39,170 --> 00:29:40,860
How dare you go out during the curfew?

507
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:42,560
You have violated the curfew. Stop,

508
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:43,570
or you will be shot.

509
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:51,560
Great General, it seems to be the General.

510
00:30:06,270 --> 00:30:06,910
Great General!

511
00:30:07,450 --> 00:30:08,170
An assassin!

512
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:12,020
Did you see the assassin?

513
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:12,420
No.

514
00:30:12,470 --> 00:30:14,270
-No. -No, I didn't.

515
00:30:14,690 --> 00:30:16,560
I only saw you running at night with a sword.

516
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:17,900
I drew the bow with no arrow to warn you,

517
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:19,270
but you ignored me.

518
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:21,670
If someone hadn't recognized you,

519
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:23,320
my arrow...

520
00:30:24,050 --> 00:30:25,280
Great General is good at archery.

521
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:26,280
Thank you

522
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:28,170
for not aiming at me.

523
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:30,400
Arrest this man who violated the curfew

524
00:30:30,810 --> 00:30:31,660
to the prison

525
00:30:31,870 --> 00:30:32,750
and punish him later.

526
00:30:32,780 --> 00:30:33,260
Yes, sir!.

527
00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:57,950
Is that General Lu in the opposite room?

528
00:31:00,990 --> 00:31:02,210
It's you! General!

529
00:31:02,380 --> 00:31:03,120
Haven't you

530
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:04,620
been released? Why are you here again?

531
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:08,100
I see.

532
00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:10,590
General is afraid that

533
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:11,460
I'm alone here.

534
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:12,680
So you come back to accompany me.

535
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:13,900
How can I repay

536
00:31:13,930 --> 00:31:15,010
your deep friendship？

537
00:31:15,890 --> 00:31:16,400
Shut up!

538
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:17,940
Did you drink?

539
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:19,100
It's none of your business.

540
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:26,850
I drank too

541
00:31:27,630 --> 00:31:29,320
in the Princess' Palace.

542
00:31:30,210 --> 00:31:33,290
That is really a fine, delicious wine.

543
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:35,470
I still feel like

544
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:37,650
I have the smell of alcohol all over me.

545
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:57,450
It's late.

546
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:59,350
What brings Assistant Minister Pei

547
00:32:00,050 --> 00:32:01,080
to the Imperial Guards?

548
00:32:01,710 --> 00:32:04,050
I shouldn't have disturbed you late at night.

549
00:32:04,490 --> 00:32:06,730
But I'm just following orders.

550
00:32:07,730 --> 00:32:08,790
I have no choice.

551
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:20,940
Great General guards the Imperial Guards late at night.

552
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:23,570
Do you know I'm coming?

553
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:25,050
Are you waiting for me here?

554
00:32:25,410 --> 00:32:26,140
No.

555
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:28,440
I'm here on orders.

556
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:31,300
Assistant Minister Pei is a guest here.

557
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:32,620
After you.

558
00:32:33,370 --> 00:32:35,330
Thank you.

559
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:39,420
Where is Su Wuming?

560
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:41,240
Here.

561
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:46,440
Su Wuming.

562
00:32:46,770 --> 00:32:48,850
You have been appointed as the Military Commander of Nanzhou.

563
00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:51,120
The letter of the appointment to Nanzhou

564
00:32:51,150 --> 00:32:52,860
and the imperial edict have been prepared.

565
00:32:53,230 --> 00:32:54,300
Take them

566
00:32:54,650 --> 00:32:55,650
to assume office in Nanzhou right now.

567
00:32:55,980 --> 00:32:56,540
Take it.

568
00:33:00,140 --> 00:33:00,900
Su Wuming.

569
00:33:01,330 --> 00:33:03,070
You've solved a big case.

570
00:33:03,710 --> 00:33:05,730
I wanted to keep you in the capital.

571
00:33:06,630 --> 00:33:07,950
But what Her Highness means

572
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:10,110
is that you should go further

573
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:11,820
for experience and toughening.

574
00:33:16,490 --> 00:33:19,140
Her Highness really cares about me.

575
00:33:19,420 --> 00:33:20,860
Assistant Minister Pei,

576
00:33:20,890 --> 00:33:22,390
please thank Her Highness on behalf of me.

577
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:23,800
Should I set off and leave the capital

578
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:24,860
tomorrow morning?

579
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:25,700
Yes.

580
00:33:26,450 --> 00:33:29,020
Her Highness also asked me to tell you one thing.

581
00:33:29,570 --> 00:33:30,790
You don't need to ride a horse

582
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:32,950
or take a carriage to the South to assume office.

583
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:34,950
You can walk there

584
00:33:35,260 --> 00:33:37,900
and think about it on the way.

585
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:39,890
Think about it?

586
00:33:40,570 --> 00:33:41,530
About what?

587
00:33:43,780 --> 00:33:45,740
My understanding is that

588
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:47,770
you solved a bizarre case

589
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:48,640
in such a short time.

590
00:33:49,010 --> 00:33:50,320
After taking great pains,

591
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:53,380
you must be exhausted.

592
00:33:53,530 --> 00:33:55,140
Take a walk along the way,

593
00:33:55,410 --> 00:33:57,940
so that you can take a rest.

594
00:33:58,660 --> 00:33:59,470
According to the Crown Prince's order,

595
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:03,180
Lu Lingfeng, General of the Imperial Guards,

596
00:34:03,550 --> 00:34:05,490
deliberately breaks the law! Doubly guilty!

597
00:34:05,860 --> 00:34:07,830
Flog him thirty times! Confiscate his houses and lands!

598
00:34:08,170 --> 00:34:09,090
Expel him from Chang'an！

599
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:13,070
Great General.

600
00:34:13,449 --> 00:34:14,570
Did you get it wrong?

601
00:34:15,010 --> 00:34:15,820
General Lu...

602
00:34:15,909 --> 00:34:17,830
As an Imperial Guard,

603
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:19,260
Lu Lingfeng broke the night curfew.

604
00:34:19,739 --> 00:34:21,429
The Crown Prince was furious and ordered it himself.

605
00:34:21,489 --> 00:34:22,449
How could I get it wrong?

606
00:34:23,580 --> 00:34:24,139
Guards!

607
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:25,060
Beat him!

608
00:34:56,860 --> 00:34:57,590
Are we out of the city?

609
00:34:57,780 --> 00:34:58,260
Yes.

610
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:01,890
Put me down now.

611
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:03,150
At least I have to carry you

612
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:04,460
to a safe place.

613
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:05,620
No.

614
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:06,580
Lu Tong,

615
00:35:07,820 --> 00:35:09,620
ordered you to throw me out of Chang'an City

616
00:35:10,090 --> 00:35:11,450
and go back to report immediately.

617
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:12,420
I'm afraid you'll be punished

618
00:35:13,250 --> 00:35:14,610
if you go back late.

619
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:16,790
I have been following you

620
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:18,540
since I joined the Imperial Guards.

621
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:20,450
I know better than anyone

622
00:35:20,490 --> 00:35:21,750
about what kind of person you are.

623
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:23,730
Now that you've made such a great achievement,

624
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:25,420
but you didn't get any reward

625
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:27,160
and even suffered such an unreasonable punishment.

626
00:35:27,970 --> 00:35:29,320
I feel it unfair for you.

627
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:31,850
It's all Lu Tong's fault.

628
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:33,550
He is jealous of your talents.

629
00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:35,260
He's afraid that you'll exceed him.

630
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:37,370
How could a Great General like him

631
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:38,250
convince people?

632
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:40,290
I'm not going back.

633
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:41,540
From now on,

634
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:43,610
I will follow you

635
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:44,840
to wherever you goes.

636
00:35:44,870 --> 00:35:45,550
Nonsense!

637
00:35:47,420 --> 00:35:48,460
Put me down now.

638
00:35:48,650 --> 00:35:49,060
I...

639
00:35:49,340 --> 00:35:49,860
No.

640
00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:52,020
Put me down.

641
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:56,060
General!

642
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:57,820
General!

643
00:36:07,830 --> 00:36:08,460
Who is there?

644
00:36:09,090 --> 00:36:10,760
Why are you sneaking around in the middle of the night?

645
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:11,940
I've found you.

646
00:36:12,370 --> 00:36:13,340
Come out and die!

647
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:15,770
If you don't come out,

648
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:17,020
then I'll

649
00:36:17,060 --> 00:36:18,130
go and cut off your head now.

650
00:36:23,450 --> 00:36:24,400
Don't hit me! Don't move!

651
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:25,780
I'm not looking for you.

652
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:27,810
I'm looking for him.

653
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:31,420
Fed!

654
00:36:31,820 --> 00:36:32,660
It's you.

655
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:34,340
Why are you here?

656
00:36:35,580 --> 00:36:37,050
How dare you ask me?

657
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:38,510
You promised me.

658
00:36:38,930 --> 00:36:39,980
One chicken a day.

659
00:36:40,290 --> 00:36:40,970
I've been so famished

660
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:42,940
for the past two days.

661
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:43,740
Where is the chicken?

662
00:36:44,210 --> 00:36:44,820
Where is the chicken?

663
00:36:44,970 --> 00:36:45,580
What chicken?

664
00:36:45,710 --> 00:36:46,460
Go away!

665
00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:47,140
You go away.

666
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:48,480
Lu Lingfeng,

667
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:50,580
you broke your promise.

668
00:36:50,740 --> 00:36:51,740
You came from a noble family,

669
00:36:52,130 --> 00:36:53,140
but you broke your promise.

670
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:55,010
I thought

671
00:36:55,030 --> 00:36:56,060
I would have chicken to eat every day

672
00:36:56,310 --> 00:36:57,710
and I wouldn't starve anymore.

673
00:36:59,350 --> 00:37:01,850
I didn't expect you to be a liar.

674
00:37:02,290 --> 00:37:03,490
You lied to me.

675
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:05,480
I must tell the whole world

676
00:37:05,730 --> 00:37:06,810
about this thing.

677
00:37:10,050 --> 00:37:11,600
Lu Lingfeng,

678
00:37:12,380 --> 00:37:13,810
not only did you break your promise,

679
00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:15,940
but also you let your dog bite others.

680
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:16,580
You...

681
00:37:16,620 --> 00:37:17,440
Who are you calling a dog?

682
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:18,460
Guo Zhuang.

683
00:37:18,850 --> 00:37:20,040
He helped me before.

684
00:37:20,410 --> 00:37:21,460
Don't give him a hard time.

685
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:23,570
But he's too shameless.

686
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:24,510
Can't he see

687
00:37:24,540 --> 00:37:25,430
you were seriously injured?

688
00:37:25,870 --> 00:37:27,270
Who said I didn't see it?

689
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:28,320
Otherwise,

690
00:37:28,350 --> 00:37:29,600
why would I go out with you?

691
00:37:30,020 --> 00:37:31,380
I want chicken anyway.

692
00:37:33,370 --> 00:37:34,680
You are tall and strong

693
00:37:34,820 --> 00:37:35,730
and not hurt.

694
00:37:35,810 --> 00:37:37,370
Can't you just catch a chicken

695
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:38,640
for me to eat?

696
00:37:38,780 --> 00:37:40,210
I have no strength if I have no chicken to eat.

697
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:42,300
Then how can I cure his injury?

698
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:46,480
That's right!

699
00:37:47,740 --> 00:37:48,380
You have medical skills.

700
00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:49,940
Treat him quickly!

701
00:37:56,350 --> 00:37:58,360
Who was trying to cut off my tongue

702
00:37:58,390 --> 00:37:59,800
and my head just now?

703
00:38:00,260 --> 00:38:00,700
Go ahead.

704
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:04,060
Sir.

705
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:05,660
Please treat thenGeneral immediately.

706
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:07,340
A chicken, right?

707
00:38:07,610 --> 00:38:08,530
I'll get it for you right now.

708
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:11,130
That's more like it.

709
00:38:17,060 --> 00:38:17,580
Fed.

710
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:19,490
Don't bother.

711
00:38:20,660 --> 00:38:21,540
I don't want to get treatment.

712
00:38:23,010 --> 00:38:24,280
You're badly injured.

713
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:25,500
and have bled so much.

714
00:38:25,780 --> 00:38:26,520
If you don't get treatment,

715
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:28,370
you'll die.

716
00:38:28,620 --> 00:38:29,150
Fed,

717
00:38:29,860 --> 00:38:31,340
I just don't want to live.

718
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:35,380
No way!

719
00:38:37,460 --> 00:38:38,660
If you want to die,

720
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:40,420
who will be in charge of my chicken?

721
00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:42,940
Besides,

722
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:45,620
you killed the Ghost Four.

723
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:47,910
and killed the miscreant, Yuan Lai.

724
00:38:48,260 --> 00:38:49,340
You made a contribution.

725
00:38:50,390 --> 00:38:52,030
If a man of merit is hit like this,

726
00:38:52,550 --> 00:38:54,400
he must have been set up.

727
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:57,300
If I haven't mistaken about you,

728
00:38:57,780 --> 00:38:58,540
you are

729
00:38:58,900 --> 00:39:00,820
a man full of sap.

730
00:39:02,060 --> 00:39:03,100
Don't you want revenge?

731
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:06,020
If you want revenge, you need treatment.

732
00:39:07,020 --> 00:39:08,010
If you don't get treatment,

733
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:09,430
the same day next year,

734
00:39:09,740 --> 00:39:11,010
your strong body

735
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:12,850
will become fertilizer

736
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:13,840
for the flowers in the wilderness.

737
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:18,220
Revenge!

738
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:28,140
Assistant Minister,

739
00:39:29,010 --> 00:39:30,370
what should we do with this servant?

740
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:49,040
Father.

741
00:40:00,580 --> 00:40:02,530
It's late and you still have work to do.

742
00:40:02,740 --> 00:40:03,780
You must be tired.

743
00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:05,100
Let me massage your back.

744
00:40:13,250 --> 00:40:13,870
What's wrong?

745
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:16,000
Are you mad at your daughter?

746
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:24,220
Father.

747
00:40:24,980 --> 00:40:26,060
Does this painting look like General?

748
00:40:28,290 --> 00:40:30,180
Father, please give the permission

749
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:32,170
to the marriage between me and General.

750
00:40:34,010 --> 00:40:34,770
Marriage?

751
00:40:35,820 --> 00:40:37,060
Are you engaged?

752
00:40:38,020 --> 00:40:38,740
No.

753
00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:42,220
Why are you talking about marriage if you're not engaged?

754
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:43,780
Forget him.

755
00:40:45,220 --> 00:40:46,060
Why?

756
00:40:46,860 --> 00:40:47,660
Father.

757
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:49,090
It's General

758
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:50,910
who saved my life.

759
00:40:51,370 --> 00:40:52,530
I think our marriage

760
00:40:52,820 --> 00:40:53,870
will be

761
00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:55,020
a good story in Chang'an City.

762
00:40:55,380 --> 00:40:56,180
Xijun.

763
00:40:56,790 --> 00:40:58,300
He isn't the General anymore.

764
00:40:59,020 --> 00:41:00,710
Lu Lingfeng has been deprived of his position,

765
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:01,660
his lands have been confiscated.

766
00:41:01,820 --> 00:41:02,860
and he has been expelled from Chang'an.

767
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:08,430
Look at your painting.

768
00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:09,250
Yesterday,

769
00:41:10,820 --> 00:41:12,580
you treated him a drink, right?

770
00:41:12,980 --> 00:41:14,140
I held a feast

771
00:41:15,460 --> 00:41:17,610
to repay the General for saving my life.

772
00:41:17,860 --> 00:41:18,900
That's right.

773
00:41:19,580 --> 00:41:20,630
The situation he's in today

774
00:41:20,870 --> 00:41:21,950
is all because of you.

775
00:41:22,610 --> 00:41:23,610
I think Lu Lingfeng

776
00:41:24,090 --> 00:41:25,460
doesn't want to see you anymore.

777
00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:27,730
You don't have to see him anymore.

778
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:29,540
You can't see him even if you want.

779
00:41:30,180 --> 00:41:31,060
From now on,

780
00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:33,320
you are not allowed to leave your room.

781
00:41:33,890 --> 00:41:35,150
Read, play Chinese zither and draw

782
00:41:35,210 --> 00:41:37,460
in the room every day.

783
00:41:37,850 --> 00:41:38,730
After some time,

784
00:41:39,170 --> 00:41:40,100
I'll find another matchmaker

785
00:41:41,230 --> 00:41:42,390
to find you

786
00:41:42,420 --> 00:41:43,340
a perfect man.

787
00:41:44,420 --> 00:41:44,980
Father.

788
00:41:49,930 --> 00:41:51,900
Nail all the windows behind.

789
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:53,500
Send someone to guard her day and night.

790
00:41:53,860 --> 00:41:54,220
Yes, sir.

791
00:42:00,260 --> 00:42:00,700
Assistant Minister.

792
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:02,140
Should I

793
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:03,490
break his legs?

794
00:42:05,380 --> 00:42:06,660
He is obedient to Xijun.

795
00:42:06,980 --> 00:42:08,140
I can count him as a loyal man.

796
00:42:09,540 --> 00:42:10,460
Put him down.

797
00:42:11,180 --> 00:42:11,820
I remember

798
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:13,420
he even practiced martial arts for a few days.

799
00:42:14,100 --> 00:42:14,420
Yes.

800
00:42:14,950 --> 00:42:15,940
He learned martial arts

801
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:16,940
from your followers.

802
00:42:18,260 --> 00:42:19,100
From now on,

803
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:21,330
let him protect Xijun.

804
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:40,320
♫The storm rises with no reason♫

805
00:42:40,970 --> 00:42:43,350
