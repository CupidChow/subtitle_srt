[Episode 36]

4
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:51,940
Your Majesty.

5
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:54,530
The moonlight in Chang'an tonight

6
00:01:54,729 --> 00:01:56,460
is so bright.

7
00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:58,090
I'm from the west.

8
00:01:58,310 --> 00:02:00,290
The way home is too far,

9
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,800
and it's unavoidable to walk at night.

10
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:04,520
I just want to borrow

11
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:06,990
some moonlight of Chang'an.

12
00:02:07,490 --> 00:02:10,169
I wonder if Your Majesty will grant me permission?

13
00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:11,750
What?

14
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,560
Borrow the moonlight?

15
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:14,830
How?

16
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:21,530
My cloak

17
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:23,310
is full of moonlight.

18
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:26,220
I can now see the way home.

19
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:28,420
What kind of illusion is this?

20
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:29,680
Just cut the craps.

21
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:34,030
Look, Your Majesty.

22
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:44,160
In the dark night,

23
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:46,130
I can even light up the way

24
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:47,610
for the whole camel team.

25
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:54,690
Amazing.

26
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:06,270
When I was in the sky,

27
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:08,330
I received an invitation from the owner of the Moon Palace.

28
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,730
He wanted to present Your Majesty

29
00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:12,610
the delicacy made by moonlight.

30
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:14,780
Delicacy made by moonlight?

31
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:15,940
What is it?

32
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:18,190
Don't worry, Your Majesty.

33
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:21,400
Let me get it for you.

34
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,010
This is a gift

35
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:00,260
from the owner of the Moon Palace.

36
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:02,290
Please have a taste, Your Majesty.

37
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:06,470
Your Majesty.

38
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:08,340
Good.

39
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:11,060
Your Majesty.

40
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:13,760
His Highness's warning just now

41
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:14,730
is reasonable.

42
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:20,380
Fine.

43
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:22,650
Give it

44
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,150
to my people of Tang.

45
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:26,440
You will be rewarded with gold.

46
00:04:27,170 --> 00:04:28,850
Thank you, Your Majesty.

47
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:38,290
Your Majesty.

48
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:41,390
I can summon your real body

49
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,640
for all people to worship.

50
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,990
Summon my real body?

51
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,320
If you are talking nonsense,

52
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:48,430
you will be beheaded.

53
00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:49,730
Please have a look.

54
00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:03,480
Look.

55
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:07,140
It is indeed.

56
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:08,460
It's amazing.

57
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:10,460
Look.

58
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:12,790
Look! Phoenix!

59
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:15,190
His Majesty is the son of the heaven.

60
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:18,990
Long live Your Majesty!

61
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,450
Long live Your Majesty!

62
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:36,780
Long live Tang!

63
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:40,270
The Emperor of Tang is the son of the heaven.

64
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:43,720
May Your Majesty live a long life.

65
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:46,370
Come!

66
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,620
Reward him handsomely!

67
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:15,200
Your Majesty.

68
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:16,430
You must be tired.

69
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:18,340
Go inside and take a rest.

70
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:38,610
Who is in the way?

71
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,120
Su Wuming, Administrator of Luozhou.

72
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,810
Please wait, Your Majesty.

73
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:46,900
Su Wuming?

74
00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:50,159
Su Wuming.

75
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,740
As the Administrator of Luozhou,

76
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:54,050
did you come to Chang'an

77
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,810
to hatch a sinister plot?

78
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:57,820
Where is Lu Tong?

79
00:07:58,060 --> 00:07:58,960
Arrest him.

80
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:04,680
Lu Tong.

81
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:05,250
You...

82
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:06,560
Chamberlain Feng.

83
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:10,210
Some words are inappropriate

84
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:11,530
for others to hear.

85
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:14,100
Your Majesty.

86
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:16,740
For the sake of Tang,

87
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:18,560
please stay.

88
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:22,380
What do you mean?

89
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:25,940
At today's magic show

90
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:29,130
in the Sky-scraping Tower,

91
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:31,800
there are many variables

92
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:33,799
and uncontrollable things.

93
00:08:34,809 --> 00:08:36,700
I'm worried that something might go wrong

94
00:08:37,929 --> 00:08:39,419
after Your Majesty leaves.

95
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:40,929
Since you know that things might go wrong,

96
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:42,679
why don't you let His Majesty leave?

97
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:44,010
Tang

98
00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:47,130
has magnificent landscape and the bright moon,

99
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,900
and it is made up of families.

100
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:52,110
If Your Majesty really leaves,

101
00:08:52,690 --> 00:08:54,310
what will happen

102
00:08:54,970 --> 00:08:56,060
to the commonners,

103
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,190
the nobilities

104
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,250
and the foreign envoys here?

105
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:08,870
Please don't worry, Your Majesty.

106
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:12,450
We have made a thorough arrangement.

107
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:14,000
We will ensure Your Majesty's safety.

108
00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:16,120
Please take a seat

109
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:18,500
and enjoy it with the people.

110
00:09:34,570 --> 00:09:35,160
Your Majesty.

111
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:36,380
Your Majesty.

112
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:49,030
Su Wuming.

113
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:51,300
What do you want to do?

114
00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:52,990
Who ordered you to do this?

115
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:54,620
Is it the princess or the Crown Prince?

116
00:10:00,730 --> 00:10:02,150
The princess and the Crown Prince

117
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,900
are both loyal to Your Majesty.

118
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:06,730
The Imperial Guards and Su Wuming

119
00:10:06,770 --> 00:10:09,320
will also defend Your Majesty to the death.

120
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:16,470
There are less than two hours left.

121
00:10:17,770 --> 00:10:19,220
Things have changed so dramatically.

122
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:23,390
We can't let His Majesty and aunt

123
00:10:24,130 --> 00:10:25,490
go to the Sky-scraping Tower to take the risk.

124
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:28,810
His Majesty has left the palace.

125
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:30,820
Then hurry up, gather your troops

126
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:31,760
to stop His Majesty.

127
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:32,540
You can't do that.

128
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:35,620
If so,

129
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:38,380
someone with ulterior motives

130
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:40,330
will charge Your Highness with treason.

131
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,060
Besides,

132
00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:42,820
the magic show

133
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:44,700
is held by His Majesty.

134
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:46,900
Please think twice, Your Highness.

135
00:10:48,170 --> 00:10:49,800
Are you suspecting that His Majesty knew about it?

136
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:53,770
I dare not make such guesses.

137
00:10:54,050 --> 00:10:56,940
But Chamberlain Feng at His Majesty's side

138
00:10:57,140 --> 00:10:58,190
is very suspicious.

139
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:01,460
Su Wuming.

140
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:03,840
At the magic show,

141
00:11:04,650 --> 00:11:05,910
I allow you to act according to circumstances

142
00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:07,540
by His Majesty's side.

143
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:33,760
Look!

144
00:11:33,970 --> 00:11:34,340
Look!

145
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:35,090
A wooden bird.

146
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:37,380
Amazing.

147
00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:45,950
Close!

148
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:53,640
Be careful.

149
00:11:55,490 --> 00:11:56,580
What is this?

150
00:11:56,770 --> 00:11:57,740
Judging from the sound,

151
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:59,480
it seems to be an assassin

152
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,600
instead of an illusion.

153
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:03,550
And the assassin

154
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,410
was not targeting His Majesty.

155
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:12,300
What happened?

156
00:12:13,130 --> 00:12:13,860
Don't worry, Your Highness.

157
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:14,690
I'm here.

158
00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:18,440
Fortunately, Lu Lingfeng had been prepared.

159
00:12:20,570 --> 00:12:21,100
Your Majesty.

160
00:12:21,410 --> 00:12:23,090
The locations of the princess and  the Crown Prince

161
00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:24,300
are especially important.

162
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:34,830
We need to practice repeatedly.

163
00:12:35,290 --> 00:12:36,570
Be fast and accurate,

164
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:38,070
and make sure that nothing goes wrong.

165
00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:38,870
Yes, sir.

166
00:12:39,330 --> 00:12:40,010
Archers!

167
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:47,860
Shoot!

168
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:53,180
What's going on?

169
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:54,090
Open it.

170
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:10,980
Don't panic.

171
00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:12,170
His Majesty is here,

172
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:13,630
no one is allowed to move.

173
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:14,660
This...

174
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:19,670
Your Majesty.

175
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,460
That wasn't a magician's performance.

176
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:25,270
It was the Illusion Killer Sass

177
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:26,930
who tried to assasinate the princess and the Crown Prince.

178
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:29,900
Administrator Du.

179
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:31,670
You seemed

180
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:33,590
to have got the whereabouts of Sass.

181
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:35,560
I'm incompetent.

182
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:37,090
I haven't caught Sass yet.

183
00:13:38,170 --> 00:13:39,920
But Lu Lingfeng,

184
00:13:39,950 --> 00:13:40,660
the Minister of Justice of Yongzhou Government,

185
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:42,340
has already known what to do.

186
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,240
I'm sorry, Your Majesty.

187
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:54,760
I'm sorry, Your Highness.

188
00:13:56,550 --> 00:13:57,680
I'm sorry, Your Highness.

189
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,320
The Illusion Killer, Sass

190
00:14:00,830 --> 00:14:01,420
should be here

191
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:03,100
now.

192
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:13,020
Wang Yuantong, Chief of Department of Bamboo.

193
00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:15,210
Are you here?

194
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,730
Why did you call me?

195
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,140
Guo Zhuang.

196
00:14:46,530 --> 00:14:48,270
Chief Wang's art of lightness is amazing.

197
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:50,900
You're the best illusionist in the world.

198
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:52,940
Don't you want to show it to us

199
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:54,840
in such a big event?

200
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:17,500
Your Majesty.

201
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:20,180
Please forgive me for deceiving you.

202
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:23,540
What happened?

203
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:24,890
Administrator Du

204
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:26,910
said I was confident.

205
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:29,630
Actually, I've lied to Administrator Du.

206
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:31,960
It was the deduction of me

207
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:33,640
and Su Wuming, the Administrator of Luozhou,

208
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:34,940
to suspect this person was Sass.

209
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:36,540
But we didn't have enough evidence.

210
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:37,380
So,

211
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:39,420
I could only force him to use martial arts

212
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:40,260
and illusions.

213
00:15:42,970 --> 00:15:43,580
That's not right.

214
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:45,700
Wang Yuantong,

215
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:48,690
you used to be the Administrator of Premier's Mansion.

216
00:15:49,530 --> 00:15:50,490
When did you

217
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:53,090
learn martial arts and illusions?

218
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:57,340
Lu Lingfeng.

219
00:15:58,100 --> 00:15:59,250
You are nobody.

220
00:15:59,730 --> 00:16:01,860
How could I fail because of you?

221
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:04,960
And you, Su Wuming.

222
00:16:05,450 --> 00:16:07,530
What exactly did you find

223
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:10,020
in Zhongnan Mountain Villa that day?

224
00:16:10,810 --> 00:16:11,710
Wang Yuantong

225
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:14,610
was my master, Detective Di's best friend.

226
00:16:15,510 --> 00:16:17,670
When I was in Luoyang,

227
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:19,960
I followed my master to meet him many times.

228
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:22,330
I went straight into the hall that day,

229
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:24,860
but you didn't recognize me.

230
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:25,850
That's the first thing.

231
00:16:26,430 --> 00:16:27,900
I'm Su Wuming, the Administrator of Luozhou.

232
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:29,030
Greetings, Chief Wang.

233
00:16:33,310 --> 00:16:34,280
Su Wuming.

234
00:16:35,010 --> 00:16:35,540
Second.

235
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:38,290
Wang Yuantong loved calligraphy.

236
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:41,280
In your so-called Zhongnan Mountain Villa,

237
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:43,150
there was no calligraphy

238
00:16:43,650 --> 00:16:45,060
hanging on the wall.

239
00:16:45,290 --> 00:16:47,610
Besides, the Chinese characters "Zhongnan Mountain Villa" at the gate

240
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:49,230
were not the style of calligraphy

241
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:51,020
that Wang Yuantong liked best.

242
00:16:50,570 --> 00:16:52,920
[Zhongnan Mountain Villa]

243
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:53,660
Third,

244
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:55,480
I left someone there

245
00:16:55,850 --> 00:16:56,970
after I went down the mountain.

246
00:16:57,190 --> 00:16:59,950
I asked her to hide in the bamboo forest.

247
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:02,630
The girl who spoke nonsense...

248
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:03,700
That was me.

249
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:04,780
This...

250
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:05,240
This...

251
00:17:05,859 --> 00:17:07,060
I saw a wooden bird

252
00:17:07,079 --> 00:17:08,440
flying out from the villa.

253
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:10,180
You can't deny it.

254
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,780
You're indeed Di Renjie's disciple.

255
00:17:14,109 --> 00:17:14,670
Today,

256
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:16,470
on the Mid-Autumn Festival night,

257
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:17,800
I'm going to put on

258
00:17:18,119 --> 00:17:19,950
the most perfect illusion show.

259
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:22,020
I'll perform it to Su Wuming,

260
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:23,609
Lu Lingfeng

261
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:25,480
and Du Ming first.

262
00:17:26,210 --> 00:17:28,240
I will avenge

263
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,000
my beloved Helan Xue.

264
00:18:08,030 --> 00:18:08,750
Wang Yuantong!

265
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:09,700
No.

266
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:12,140
If you are Sass,

267
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:13,810
then where is Wang Yuantong?

268
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:17,180
I'm afraid that Wang Yuantong

269
00:18:17,570 --> 00:18:18,600
had been killed by Sass

270
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:21,160
12 years ago.

271
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:23,490
Su Wuming.

272
00:18:23,930 --> 00:18:25,220
Do you have evidence?

273
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:26,770
Yes.

274
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:40,960
All the accomplices of Sass

275
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,220
had been arrested by my master at that time.

276
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:45,590
Sass

277
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:47,260
was the only one missing.

278
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:48,490
At that time,

279
00:18:48,790 --> 00:18:50,980
Luoyang had been secretly locked down.

280
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:52,020
My master believed

281
00:18:52,350 --> 00:18:54,430
that Sass couldn't have escaped.

282
00:18:55,490 --> 00:18:56,370
Unfortunately,

283
00:18:57,270 --> 00:18:59,160
my teacher suddenly got seriously ill.

284
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:01,390
He was worried

285
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,700
that he would soon die.

286
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:06,970
So he recommended Du Ming to take office in Yongzhou

287
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:10,080
in order to trap Sass with Helan Xue.

288
00:19:11,070 --> 00:19:13,380
During the time where my master was seriously ill,

289
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:15,410
Wang Yuantong resigned.

290
00:19:15,570 --> 00:19:17,330
Before he left Luoyang,

291
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:19,100
he came to

292
00:19:19,370 --> 00:19:22,080
visit my master.

293
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:25,700
At that time, my master was too sick to speak.

294
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:27,220
After Wang Yuantong left,

295
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:29,810
my master asked me to bring him a pen and paper

296
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:33,420
to write down this half character.

297
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:36,020
It's been 12 years.

298
00:19:36,830 --> 00:19:38,330
I finally understand

299
00:19:38,530 --> 00:19:41,660
what my master had written is the word, "fake".

300
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:44,970
Wang Yuantong had been killed at that time,

301
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:46,630
so the one who came to visit my master

302
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:48,580
was Sass.

303
00:19:49,930 --> 00:19:50,890
He was showing off

304
00:19:51,050 --> 00:19:53,040
to Detective Di on the bed.

305
00:19:53,210 --> 00:19:55,770
But my master

306
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:57,710
still found his flaws.

307
00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:00,410
I never thought that

308
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,670
you had mastered your skill of changing looks

309
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:05,140
to perfection.

310
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:08,300
You not only changed your appearance,

311
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:12,250
but how could your long legs

312
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:14,620
become shorter?

313
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:17,570
You're right.

314
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:24,850
I thought no one in the world could know

315
00:20:26,150 --> 00:20:28,740
what had happened 12 years ago.

316
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:30,300
I didn't expect

317
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:33,180
you would reveal it today.

318
00:20:34,170 --> 00:20:36,260
I sawed off my legs

319
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:37,880
and reattached them again

320
00:20:37,910 --> 00:20:39,110
to become Wang Yuantong.

321
00:20:39,890 --> 00:20:41,480
If you hadn't cheated,

322
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:45,230
no one would have known that I'm Sass.

323
00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:50,700
After I left Luoyang,

324
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:52,510
I went back to

325
00:20:52,530 --> 00:20:54,510
Wang Yuantong's hometown, Shazhou.

326
00:20:55,230 --> 00:20:57,280
I wanted to continue escaping to the west.

327
00:20:57,910 --> 00:20:58,970
I didn't expect

328
00:20:59,490 --> 00:21:00,980
the officials in Shazhou

329
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:02,540
would worship me.

330
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:05,990
They all said that I was the most loyal official in Tang.

331
00:21:06,350 --> 00:21:08,200
Sooner or later,

332
00:21:08,610 --> 00:21:10,720
I would be recalled to be the Prime Minister.

333
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:12,160
That's your ambition.

334
00:21:13,570 --> 00:21:14,130
Back then,

335
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:15,950
you were Vice Department Chief of the Concubinus Institution.

336
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:17,280
You did everything you could

337
00:21:17,590 --> 00:21:18,500
to eliminate dissidents

338
00:21:18,530 --> 00:21:19,920
for Empress Wu Zetian

339
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:22,220
so that one day

340
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:23,520
you could be the Prime Minister.

341
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:24,300
Yes.

342
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:28,080
I had been in Shazhou for 11 years.

343
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,400
Then the day finally came.

344
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:31,630
His Majesty sent Pei Jian

345
00:21:31,670 --> 00:21:33,470
to pick me up in Shazhou

346
00:21:34,030 --> 00:21:34,990
and return to Chang'an.

347
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:37,100
Although I was not a high-ranking official,

348
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:39,950
Yuwen Mukai would still discussed

349
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:44,260
about such a big event as building the Sky-scraping Tower with me.

350
00:21:45,690 --> 00:21:47,950
I saw the chance to be the Prime Minister.

351
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:50,320
I wanted to help His Majesty

352
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:52,350
to truly control Tang

353
00:21:53,690 --> 00:21:55,810
without being manipulated by anyone.

354
00:22:00,990 --> 00:22:02,530
Did you really think that

355
00:22:02,570 --> 00:22:03,810
you are Wang Yuantong?

356
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:06,460
Unfortunately, you are not.

357
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:10,090
You're so calm.

358
00:22:10,950 --> 00:22:12,050
I've used Helan Xue

359
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,320
to trap you for 12 years,

360
00:22:13,650 --> 00:22:14,820
but you didn't take the bait.

361
00:22:15,370 --> 00:22:16,780
For the  dream of being the Prime Minister,

362
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:18,100
you were cautious.

363
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:19,240
But unexpectedly,

364
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:20,800
the fake Sass

365
00:22:21,510 --> 00:22:22,990
openly provoked the court.

366
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:24,690
You were furious

367
00:22:24,970 --> 00:22:26,360
and tried to kill him with wooden bird,

368
00:22:26,790 --> 00:22:27,770
but you killed

369
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:30,100
Wan An, the Minister of Justice of Yongzhou wrongly.

370
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:31,300
Sass.

371
00:22:32,490 --> 00:22:33,860
When you were in Luoyang,

372
00:22:34,290 --> 00:22:36,650
you've committed many murders.

373
00:22:37,290 --> 00:22:39,150
Today, you killed

374
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:40,920
the builder of the Sky-scraping Tower,

375
00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:42,260
Yuwen Mukai.

376
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:44,180
Are you still not pleading guilty?

377
00:22:44,690 --> 00:22:46,150
Surrendering now?

378
00:23:19,150 --> 00:23:20,740
I'm not Wang Yuantong.

379
00:23:22,810 --> 00:23:23,980
I'm Sass.

380
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:26,220
I'm a pawn that has been used

381
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:28,160
and then abandoned.

382
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:31,840
I'm an avenger

383
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:32,740
who have lost Helan Xue.

384
00:23:34,050 --> 00:23:35,910
I'm a Illusion Killer

385
00:23:35,930 --> 00:23:37,210
who has lost my mind.

386
00:23:38,770 --> 00:23:39,870
The Emperor of Tang,

387
00:23:40,430 --> 00:23:41,310
the princess,

388
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:42,600
Crown Prince,

389
00:23:43,310 --> 00:23:44,600
the officials

390
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:46,810
and envoys of other countries are all here.

391
00:23:48,610 --> 00:23:51,330
Tang and I will perish together!

392
00:23:53,290 --> 00:23:56,450
No one can stop me.

393
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:10,910
He's going to destroy the tower!

394
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:12,100
Save me!

395
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:23,430
Don't move!

396
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:26,310
If one is in chaos, everyone will be in chaos.

397
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:28,810
There are thousands of people

398
00:24:28,830 --> 00:24:29,700
outside there.

399
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:31,790
If there is a riot,

400
00:24:32,490 --> 00:24:33,630
there will be countless casualties

401
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,590
caused by trampling.

402
00:24:36,010 --> 00:24:37,830
The safety of His Majesty might be even more unstable.

403
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:39,150
Where are the Imperial Guards?

404
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,160
Yes.

405
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:41,570
For any troublemaker,

406
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:43,380
just rend them!

407
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:52,250
It's indeed eighteen floors.

408
00:24:52,630 --> 00:24:53,710
In order to build up to

409
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:54,660
thirty-three floors,

410
00:24:55,390 --> 00:24:56,840
Yuwen Mukai can only accept

411
00:24:56,860 --> 00:24:57,960
his friend's suggestion.

412
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,190
His friend

413
00:24:59,490 --> 00:25:00,840
was a trusted aide of His Majesty,

414
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:02,780
and was ordered to come up with ideas.

415
00:25:04,290 --> 00:25:06,020
His Majesty's trusted aide?

416
00:25:06,770 --> 00:25:08,010
A low ranking official?

417
00:25:08,890 --> 00:25:10,650
Is it Wang Yuantong?

418
00:25:10,850 --> 00:25:11,610
Yes.

419
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:12,800
It's him.

420
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:14,650
He is knowledgeable.

421
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:15,940
His idea

422
00:25:16,270 --> 00:25:17,990
indeed made the building of thirty-three floors possible.

423
00:25:18,450 --> 00:25:18,930
But...

424
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:19,900
the unique Sky-scraping Tower

425
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:21,930
in the world

426
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:23,860
will become a dangerous building.

427
00:25:24,270 --> 00:25:26,190
If it is destroyed from here,

428
00:25:26,470 --> 00:25:27,710
the dozens of upper floors

429
00:25:27,930 --> 00:25:29,520
will collapse instantly.

430
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:38,220
Old Immortal,

431
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:40,500
do you have any solution to it?

432
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:43,250
I didn't have

433
00:25:43,830 --> 00:25:45,550
any good ideas.

434
00:25:46,530 --> 00:25:47,780
Otherwise, how would I sit and watch

435
00:25:47,810 --> 00:25:50,090
Mr. Yuwen regretting for the rest of his life?

436
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:53,060
What should we do?

437
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:55,380
If the Sky-scraping Tower collapse

438
00:25:57,260 --> 00:25:58,580
on the night of Mid-Autumn Festival,

439
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:02,140
The Tang Dynasty

440
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:05,200
will be destroyed.

441
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:07,500
Old Immortal,

442
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:10,900
can you design a mechanism for me?

443
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:12,350
What is it for?

444
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:13,620
His Majesty has ordered that

445
00:26:14,250 --> 00:26:15,050
on the Mid-Autumn Festival night,

446
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:17,490
no one is allowed to guard in the Sky-scraping Tower.

447
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:20,850
Once someone uses some strange tricks

448
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:21,740
to reach 18th floor

449
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:23,020
immediately...

450
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:43,070
[18th floor]

451
00:28:34,130 --> 00:28:35,720
Greetings, Your Highness.

452
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:42,500
You saved me again.

453
00:28:43,110 --> 00:28:44,590
How should I thank you?

454
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:45,540
I dare not.

455
00:28:46,330 --> 00:28:47,210
It's my duty.

456
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,240
On the Mid-Autumn Festival night,

457
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:50,690
everyone saw you

458
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:52,300
turn the tide.

459
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:55,640
This morning, four prime ministers jointly submitted a petition

460
00:28:56,170 --> 00:28:58,100
to recommend you as the Deputy President of the Supreme Court.

461
00:28:58,950 --> 00:29:01,180
Just wait for the imperial edict.

462
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:05,540
His Majesty has ordered

463
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:07,360
to demolish the building.

464
00:29:08,690 --> 00:29:11,510
There will be no more Beyond Heaven in the world.

465
00:29:13,210 --> 00:29:14,440
It's rare for you

466
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:15,350
to come upstairs with me today.

467
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:19,800
What did you see?

468
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:27,830
How beautiful is Chang'an!

469
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,500
Long live the Tang!

470
00:29:32,130 --> 00:29:34,020
That sounds like what I said before.

471
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:36,710
Yes.

472
00:29:37,930 --> 00:29:38,890
That's because you were right, Your Highness,

473
00:29:39,730 --> 00:29:40,750
so I kept it in mind.

474
00:29:42,050 --> 00:29:44,000
I, Lu Lingfeng, am willing to

475
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:45,780
to serve the Tang Dynasty.

476
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:57,160
I asked you here

477
00:29:58,250 --> 00:29:59,360
to tell you

478
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:00,680
something initially.

479
00:30:22,450 --> 00:30:24,930
But now I seem to forget about it.

480
00:30:33,780 --> 00:30:36,020
This is the closest place to the sky.

481
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:40,080
Stay with me a little longer.

482
00:30:42,670 --> 00:30:43,270
Staying at here,

483
00:30:44,810 --> 00:30:47,160
breathing in and out

484
00:30:48,690 --> 00:30:50,090
makes me comfortable.

485
00:31:15,830 --> 00:31:18,130
[Words of Detective Di]

486
00:31:16,130 --> 00:31:17,600
Words of Detective Di?

487
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,630
I've recorded this

488
00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:24,380
when I was following my master.

489
00:31:25,290 --> 00:31:26,140
There are six volumes in total.

490
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:28,280
The three old books

491
00:31:28,310 --> 00:31:30,430
I lent you

492
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:31,990
are the last three volumes.

493
00:31:33,430 --> 00:31:34,680
These are the first three volumes.

494
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:35,640
This...

495
00:31:37,450 --> 00:31:38,500
What do you mean?

496
00:31:48,630 --> 00:31:50,330
Master Di,

497
00:31:51,710 --> 00:31:53,280
back then, you told me

498
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:56,360
you didn't take Lu Lingfeng as your disciple

499
00:31:56,390 --> 00:31:58,950
because he was young, reckless,

500
00:31:59,170 --> 00:32:00,590
and arrogant.

501
00:32:01,610 --> 00:32:02,770
But at the same time you said that

502
00:32:03,570 --> 00:32:05,650
he was kind,

503
00:32:05,870 --> 00:32:07,190
intelligent,

504
00:32:07,530 --> 00:32:08,630
forthright and sincere,

505
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:10,240
and cared about the world.

506
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:12,000
He had great potential.

507
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:13,920
If one day,

508
00:32:14,330 --> 00:32:15,700
he could truly understand

509
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:17,630
the suffering of the people,

510
00:32:17,750 --> 00:32:19,150
and the needs of the people

511
00:32:19,330 --> 00:32:20,720
through various experiences,

512
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:23,490
Su Wuming

513
00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:25,920
shall take him as your disciple on behalf of you.

514
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:28,060
Today,

515
00:32:28,810 --> 00:32:30,660
Lu Lingfeng has became a great man.

516
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:32,770
He has killed Sass

517
00:32:32,930 --> 00:32:34,600
and fulfilled master's last wish.

518
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:36,130
I'll do

519
00:32:36,890 --> 00:32:38,240
as you say,

520
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:41,400
to take him as your disciple.

521
00:32:45,770 --> 00:32:46,500
Lu Lingfeng,

522
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:51,290
will you be Detective Di's disciple?

523
00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:00,590
Yes.

524
00:33:05,730 --> 00:33:06,240
Bow.

525
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:22,570
[Eliminate evil and promote good]

526
00:33:32,490 --> 00:33:33,060
Father,

527
00:33:34,830 --> 00:33:35,650
please let me go south

528
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:36,760
with you.

529
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:38,760
No.

530
00:33:39,580 --> 00:33:40,780
Being demoted to Nanzhou

531
00:33:41,030 --> 00:33:42,150
is no different from beheading.

532
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:43,980
I've even dismissed

533
00:33:44,010 --> 00:33:44,890
our servants.

534
00:33:45,740 --> 00:33:47,130
How can I let my daughter

535
00:33:47,610 --> 00:33:48,940
die with me?

536
00:33:49,270 --> 00:33:50,930
Nanzhou is remote,

537
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:54,040
but life is not that hard.

538
00:33:54,610 --> 00:33:55,380
Vice Minister Pei,

539
00:33:55,820 --> 00:33:57,360
don't be too pessimistic.

540
00:33:57,710 --> 00:33:58,480
Su Wu Ming.

541
00:33:59,140 --> 00:34:00,540
Leaving Luoyang without permission

542
00:34:00,690 --> 00:34:01,490
is a serious crime,

543
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:03,000
but you've atoned for your mistake,

544
00:34:03,370 --> 00:34:04,370
and you are even given

545
00:34:04,730 --> 00:34:06,010
the position of the Assistant of Qianling Mausoleum.

546
00:34:06,190 --> 00:34:07,220
Although it is a low ranking position,

547
00:34:07,570 --> 00:34:09,179
you're still keeping vigil for the late emperors.

548
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:10,940
Are you happy now?

549
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:14,100
Are you here to laugh at me?

550
00:34:14,210 --> 00:34:14,889
Assistant Minister,

551
00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:17,900
now that Xijun is my sworn sister,

552
00:34:18,190 --> 00:34:20,219
you are my elder.

553
00:34:20,449 --> 00:34:21,690
How dare I laugh at you?

554
00:34:22,580 --> 00:34:24,199
Since you still regard her as your sworn sister,

555
00:34:25,469 --> 00:34:26,550
take good care of her.

556
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:28,000
Sure.

557
00:34:28,929 --> 00:34:29,370
Okay.

558
00:34:30,370 --> 00:34:31,449
I don't need you anyway.

559
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:32,380
Lu Lingfeng,

560
00:34:32,699 --> 00:34:34,650
you're now promoted to the Deputy President of the Supreme Court.

561
00:34:35,130 --> 00:34:36,770
I'm no longer the Assistant Minister,

562
00:34:38,550 --> 00:34:40,380
do you still think highly of my daughter?

563
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:43,389
As long as Xijun don't give up on me,

564
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:44,710
that's all that

565
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:46,429
I could wish for.

566
00:34:50,469 --> 00:34:51,159
Great.

567
00:34:52,230 --> 00:34:53,989
Since you will take care of my daughter,

568
00:34:54,429 --> 00:34:56,699
I'm relieved.

569
00:34:57,510 --> 00:34:59,030
I heard that you were given

570
00:34:59,150 --> 00:35:00,230
a good position?

571
00:35:00,750 --> 00:35:02,130
Sheriff of Ju County.

572
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:03,890
Is it still regarded as an official?

573
00:35:05,060 --> 00:35:06,190
I heard that the miasma

574
00:35:06,390 --> 00:35:07,380
there is awful.

575
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:09,240
With my age,

576
00:35:09,730 --> 00:35:11,750
I think I might suffer from severe headache.

577
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:12,940
Xijun.

578
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:14,390
You've been back for so long.

579
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:15,430
Didn't you tell the Assistant Minister

580
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:17,400
about what happened in Ju County?

581
00:35:18,460 --> 00:35:18,860
Father.

582
00:35:19,490 --> 00:35:20,780
The headache disease of the people in Ju County

583
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:22,430
has been cured by Master Fed.

584
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:24,020
You won't be suffering from anything.

585
00:35:25,030 --> 00:35:25,770
Master Fed?

586
00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:28,020
His name is Chicken Fed.

587
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:29,600
He's my guest.

588
00:35:29,930 --> 00:35:31,690
He was saving those Luoyang girls

589
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:33,960
who were poisoned by the Face Flower

590
00:35:34,110 --> 00:35:35,660
in Luoyang previously.

591
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:37,990
I've sent someone to tell him that

592
00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:38,660
you're going to Ju County.

593
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:40,300
He's already in Ju County

594
00:35:40,810 --> 00:35:42,670
to be your vanguard.

595
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:46,720
Bring it in.

596
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:56,750
I asked the disciple of Lu Ban

597
00:35:56,770 --> 00:35:58,570
to make this for you.

598
00:35:59,210 --> 00:36:00,510
Try it. Is it comfortable?

599
00:36:03,210 --> 00:36:04,290
I didn’t expect that

600
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:06,890
I have to rely on my daughter's friends

601
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:09,140
when I'm

602
00:36:09,670 --> 00:36:11,030
in trouble.

603
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:22,540
Stop.

604
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:25,450
Go back.

605
00:36:26,070 --> 00:36:27,120
I still want to

606
00:36:27,710 --> 00:36:28,710
ask this.

607
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:31,630
Does His Majesty know

608
00:36:33,110 --> 00:36:34,750
about the plan of the Sky-scraping Tower?

609
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:42,680
In fact,

610
00:36:43,310 --> 00:36:44,700
I don't care

611
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:45,930
who had Chang'an black tea.

612
00:36:47,190 --> 00:36:49,120
It's just that within the imperial court,

613
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:50,030
there are people

614
00:36:50,780 --> 00:36:51,810
under the princess,

615
00:36:52,890 --> 00:36:54,810
and also people under the Crown Prince.

616
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:57,290
But me as the Emperor of Tang...

617
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:16,330
Do you understand

618
00:37:16,530 --> 00:37:18,100
His Majesty's words?

619
00:37:21,430 --> 00:37:23,370
Yuan Lai might be evil

620
00:37:23,730 --> 00:37:24,730
for harming people with black tea,

621
00:37:25,170 --> 00:37:27,460
but he is loyal to His Majesty.

622
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:29,430
Including

623
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:30,900
those swindler around him,

624
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:32,890
they can be used too.

625
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:37,620
As the Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Personnel Administration,

626
00:37:38,810 --> 00:37:40,570
how can I help His Majesty?

627
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:45,030
Please tell me.

628
00:37:46,910 --> 00:37:48,500
Of course recommending talents

629
00:37:48,620 --> 00:37:50,630
to His Majesty.

630
00:37:51,090 --> 00:37:53,020
When His Majesty was the Premier,

631
00:37:53,380 --> 00:37:55,650
Wang Yuantong was the Administrator of the Premier's Residence,

632
00:37:56,140 --> 00:37:58,020
and he is living in his hometown in Shazhou now.

633
00:37:58,230 --> 00:38:01,430
His Majesty has been mentioning

634
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:03,280
him to me recently.

635
00:38:10,170 --> 00:38:10,850
Wang,

636
00:38:11,090 --> 00:38:12,560
that was interesting.

637
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:22,980
Look.

638
00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:25,900
This lotus is so beautiful.

639
00:38:30,050 --> 00:38:30,730
Pei.

640
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:36,060
Your Majesty.

641
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:37,610
Wang Yuantong

642
00:38:37,890 --> 00:38:38,730
is a loyal official.

643
00:38:39,270 --> 00:38:40,290
He has resigned for so many years,

644
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:43,130
yet he's been thinking for the imperial court

645
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:44,960
and was planning for me.

646
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:46,460
Pei,

647
00:38:47,130 --> 00:38:48,400
you went to Shazhou

648
00:38:48,810 --> 00:38:50,290
and brought him back to Chang'an.

649
00:38:51,210 --> 00:38:51,970
Thank you.

650
00:38:53,180 --> 00:38:54,080
Thank you, Your Majesty.

651
00:39:00,130 --> 00:39:01,410
Of course His Majesty

652
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:05,230
doesn't know.

653
00:39:06,020 --> 00:39:07,380
Hadn't Chamberlain Feng

654
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:08,580
been executed?

655
00:39:09,030 --> 00:39:10,720
His original name is Feng Han.

656
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:12,010
He and Sass

657
00:39:12,290 --> 00:39:13,840
are both Zhang Yizhi's men.

658
00:39:14,540 --> 00:39:16,220
Back then, when Heavenly Empress was eliminating dissidents,

659
00:39:16,820 --> 00:39:17,850
many murders

660
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:20,220
were related to them.

661
00:39:21,130 --> 00:39:23,500
Later, they were castrated as punishment.

662
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:25,460
Then, he earned himself merit for exposing

663
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:27,440
and was reused.

664
00:39:28,130 --> 00:39:28,810
This time,

665
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:31,970
he must have colluded with Sass

666
00:39:32,980 --> 00:39:34,220
and deceived His Majesty.

667
00:39:39,270 --> 00:39:40,870
If He Majesty didn't know,

668
00:39:41,490 --> 00:39:43,110
why did he try to leave early

669
00:39:44,250 --> 00:39:46,820
from the magic show that day?

670
00:39:47,140 --> 00:39:47,450
Also,

671
00:39:48,250 --> 00:39:49,840
did His Majesty know that

672
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:51,950
Sass was the one who

673
00:39:51,980 --> 00:39:52,700
pretended as Wang Yuantong?

674
00:39:54,580 --> 00:39:56,530
You're just speculating.

675
00:39:57,500 --> 00:39:59,580
His Majesty has spared you from death.

676
00:40:00,140 --> 00:40:01,010
Remember,

677
00:40:02,020 --> 00:40:04,190
don't ask anything you shouldn't ask.

678
00:40:05,110 --> 00:40:06,390
Don't even think about it.

679
00:40:07,850 --> 00:40:09,320
You've lost your position as the Administrator of Luozhou,

680
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:11,080
don't lose your head

681
00:40:12,110 --> 00:40:13,740
in the end.

682
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:17,300
Understood.

683
00:40:19,820 --> 00:40:20,580
Lu Lingfeng,

684
00:40:21,730 --> 00:40:22,970
you're still young

685
00:40:23,290 --> 00:40:24,380
and has a high rank position.

686
00:40:24,570 --> 00:40:25,820
Don't learn from Su Wuming.

687
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:27,430
Otherwise, I still need to worry about Xijun

688
00:40:27,820 --> 00:40:29,370
when I get to Nanzhou.

689
00:40:30,620 --> 00:40:31,060
Alright.

690
00:40:31,540 --> 00:40:32,300
You may leave now.

691
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:35,660
See you later.

692
00:40:41,090 --> 00:40:41,540
Let's go.

693
00:40:59,810 --> 00:41:00,640
What's your plan?

694
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:04,120
Being a Assistant of Qiangling Mausoleum,

695
00:41:04,610 --> 00:41:05,740
I feel sorry for you.

696
00:41:06,740 --> 00:41:08,500
The Qianling Mausoleum is quiet.

697
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:09,830
I just need to do some cleaning in the morning,

698
00:41:10,470 --> 00:41:11,310
and I can study at night.

699
00:41:11,340 --> 00:41:12,370
Isn't that wonderful?

700
00:41:12,980 --> 00:41:13,630
But

701
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:19,350
I'm worried that there are still remnants of Sass's gang

702
00:41:19,380 --> 00:41:20,090
who are still alive.

703
00:41:21,620 --> 00:41:22,980
You must be careful.

704
00:41:23,020 --> 00:41:24,350
Don't worry.

705
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:26,490
Ying Tao has told me that

706
00:41:26,860 --> 00:41:28,010
she'll follow me

707
00:41:28,110 --> 00:41:29,220
and protect me always.

708
00:41:29,260 --> 00:41:29,770
Always.

709
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:34,940
Su Wuming,

710
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:36,590
So you're

711
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:37,770
bringing your love

712
00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:39,170
to enjoy a leisure life.

713
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:43,350
I've been alone for half of my life.

714
00:41:43,410 --> 00:41:45,690
Shouldn't I enjoy my life?

715
00:41:48,020 --> 00:41:48,510
Coming.

716
00:41:59,690 --> 00:42:00,130
Look.

717
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:03,890
How great is the Tang!

718
00:42:04,740 --> 00:42:07,980
Everything is peaceful and bright,

719
00:42:08,310 --> 00:42:09,900
and prosperous as a dream.

720
00:42:10,650 --> 00:42:11,960
The more beautiful the flowers are,

721
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:13,620
the more unpredictable

722
00:42:14,260 --> 00:42:16,380
their shadows are.

723
00:42:16,930 --> 00:42:17,980
The magnificent Tang

724
00:42:18,420 --> 00:42:19,470
is like a mirror.

725
00:42:19,970 --> 00:42:22,240
One side of it is full with dancing and sing,

726
00:42:22,530 --> 00:42:23,650
on the other side...

727
00:42:26,950 --> 00:42:30,320
You are the new Deputy President of the Supreme Court.

728
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:31,960
You are needed

729
00:42:32,250 --> 00:42:33,930
to wipe out the dark side

730
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:35,290
completely

731
00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:38,800
so that the sky of Tang

732
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:40,840
will be bright always.

733
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:54,280
[The old story is over. The new case is about to start.]

734
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:54,280
[To be continued. Please kindly wait for it.]

735
00:43:04,460 --> 00:43:04,880
Hey!

736
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:06,800
How many do you like?

737
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:08,120
What do you mean?

738
00:43:08,660 --> 00:43:09,300
Children.

739
00:43:10,100 --> 00:43:11,100
How many boys and girls?

740
00:43:14,050 --> 00:43:15,280
I, Su Wuming, of course would

741
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:18,320
like to have as many as possible

742
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:19,730
because the more, the better.

743
00:43:24,260 --> 00:43:25,400
But some people

744
00:43:25,810 --> 00:43:26,880
have to suffer.

745
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:31,820
Are you talking about me

746
00:43:32,220 --> 00:43:33,250
or you?

747
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:38,960
Let's work hard together.

748
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,130
A-Are you done?

749
00:44:11,630 --> 00:44:12,900
Don't worry.

750
00:44:13,170 --> 00:44:14,650
This portrait is very important.

751
00:44:17,290 --> 00:44:18,980
It's all for yourself.

752
00:44:19,570 --> 00:44:20,250
No.

753
00:44:20,830 --> 00:44:23,260
Lu Lingfeng cracked the mysterious case of the Sky-scraping Tower,

754
00:44:23,490 --> 00:44:24,320
killed Sass,

755
00:44:24,610 --> 00:44:25,690
and save the Emperor of Tang

756
00:44:25,850 --> 00:44:27,110
along with the people of Chang'an.

757
00:44:27,510 --> 00:44:28,720
You've became famous overnight.

758
00:44:29,350 --> 00:44:30,470
Many people

759
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:31,980
are eager to hang your portrait in their houses.

760
00:44:34,020 --> 00:44:35,020
Why do they want

761
00:44:36,260 --> 00:44:36,940
to hang my portrait?

762
00:44:37,230 --> 00:44:38,160
To exorcise the ghosts and the evil spirits.

763
00:44:49,090 --> 00:44:55,550
[Supreme Court]

764
00:44:53,970 --> 00:44:56,130
Greetings, Deputy President Lu.

765
00:45:02,390 --> 00:45:03,390
Where is the secretary?

766
00:45:04,510 --> 00:45:04,950
Here.

767
00:45:05,580 --> 00:45:06,170
Here.

768
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:08,930
I heard that there are a lot of cases.

769
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:10,340
How many in total?

770
00:45:10,580 --> 00:45:11,300
Sir,

771
00:45:11,940 --> 00:45:13,790
there are over 98,760 cases

772
00:45:13,950 --> 00:45:16,990
in the supreme court now.

773
00:45:21,900 --> 00:45:22,560
Deputy President Lu!

774
00:45:22,740 --> 00:45:23,300
Deputy President!

775
00:45:23,740 --> 00:45:24,300
Deputy President Lu!

776
00:45:24,330 --> 00:45:25,420
Deputy President! Deputy President!

777
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:26,080
Deputy President Lu!

778
00:45:26,110 --> 00:45:27,910
Deputy President! Deputy President!

779
00:45:32,830 --> 00:45:33,320
Hurry.

780
00:45:33,830 --> 00:45:38,070
Go and get Su Wuming!

781
