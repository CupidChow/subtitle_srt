[Episode 26]

4
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:47,490
I'm really sorry.

5
00:01:48,259 --> 00:01:49,410
But the schedule has been set.

6
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:51,140
I can't do as you say.

7
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:52,780
Zeng Sanyi.

8
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:55,300
Every time when it comes to the Tuo God Ceremony,

9
00:01:55,610 --> 00:01:56,479
you must

10
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:57,479
have something else to do.

11
00:01:58,210 --> 00:01:59,090
I think

12
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,720
you are deliberately against us!

13
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:01,420
Guards!

14
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:01,960
Yes, sir.

15
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:03,700
Take the Tuo God Wine back!

16
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:05,250
-Yes. -No. No. Chief Shen.

17
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:05,980
Chief Shen.

18
00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:08,810
Stay for a drink before you leave.

19
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,090
Mr. Zeng.

20
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:16,660
Why do you have to do this?

21
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:20,340
I'm an official of Tang,

22
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:23,980
not the official of the Shrine.

23
00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:27,180
You

24
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:29,700
have gone completely gaga.

25
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:35,180
Commander Su.

26
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,600
Tomorrow is the deadline

27
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:38,560
of the case.

28
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:41,650
You've made a military pledge.

29
00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:43,329
Don't worry, Administrator.

30
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:44,640
I didn't forget it.

31
00:02:45,079 --> 00:02:46,820
The key to this case is

32
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:48,470
Prefectural Governor Li's whereabouts.

33
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:50,100
Actually, I already know

34
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:50,810
where he is.

35
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:52,340
Where?

36
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:54,130
Island of Tuo God.

37
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:56,829
Island of Tuo God?

38
00:02:57,790 --> 00:02:59,700
Prefectural Governor Li will show up

39
00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:02,220
at the God Sighting Ceremony tomorrow.

40
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:03,980
Really?

41
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:06,840
Are you sure?

42
00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:12,070
I never joke.

43
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,050
He ran away?

44
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:19,840
How dare you let him run away

45
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:21,520
after stealing my wine?

46
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:22,910
You losers!

47
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:25,560
Jump into the Swamp of Alligators yourself!

48
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:27,520
Please spare my life! Tuo God!

49
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:28,730
Please calm down!

50
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:30,190
Tomorrow is the God Sighting Ceremony.

51
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:31,530
You need people.

52
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:32,840
Besides, the one who ran away

53
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:34,710
must have been swallowed by the giant alligator.

54
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,360
That's why we couldn't find him.

55
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:38,100
Right Guardian is right.

56
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:40,360
Catch him before the ceremony.

57
00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:41,610
Otherwise,

58
00:03:42,050 --> 00:03:44,329
you know where you should go.

59
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:45,660
Thank you. Tuo God.

60
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:46,620
Also,

61
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,440
Su Wuming will go to the island tomorrow.

62
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,930
He must die.

63
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:55,329
Otherwise, the Shrine will be in danger.

64
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:56,350
-Yes, sir! -Yes, sir.

65
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:57,700
Please don't worry.

66
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:58,990
Don't forget

67
00:03:59,579 --> 00:04:03,290
Lu Yong locked in Ninghu Prison.

68
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:04,030
Yes, sir.

69
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:07,340
Behave yourself!

70
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:12,580
How dare you pretend to be the government officials

71
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:13,540
and go to the prison to summon a prisoner?

72
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:17,110
In Ninghu,

73
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,200
the Shrine is the government.

74
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:20,630
We do everything legally.

75
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:24,060
I'm here on the order of Tuo God to take you to the island.

76
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:25,490
At tomorrow's God Sighting Ceremony,

77
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:27,720
you'll be fed to the Tuo God.

78
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:43,490
We're too late.

79
00:04:43,909 --> 00:04:44,909
What should we do?

80
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:46,850
There's only one way.

81
00:04:47,450 --> 00:04:48,450
We can sneak into the Island of Tuo God

82
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:49,820
at night by boat.

83
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:50,590
Tomorrow,

84
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:52,180
I'll save Mr. Lu

85
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:52,740
even if I die.

[Commander's Residence]

87
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:56,780
Are you clear

88
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:57,680
what each of you should do?

89
00:04:58,860 --> 00:04:59,710
Clear!

90

Fed.

91
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:09,290
There is one more thing

92
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:10,450
you have to do.

93
00:05:10,670 --> 00:05:11,750
Why do I do

94
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:12,540
more than them?

95
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:13,940
Because you are the only one

96
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,150
who can do this.

97
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:29,460
The annual God Sighting Ceremony

98
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:31,430
is really exciting.

99
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:34,180
Commander, it's your first time.

100
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:37,440
It will be an eye-opener for you.

101
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,640
You are right.

102
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:44,659
This is my luck.

103
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:48,180
Someone drank divine wine without permission!

104
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:53,030
Chief Shen.

105
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:54,790
He has Tuo God Wine in his gourd.

106
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:00,350
He claimed to be

107
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:01,170
a guest of the Commander.

108
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:06,280
Commander, is he your guest?

109
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:11,150
He... He is my guest.

110
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:12,940
That day, Lu Lingfeng said

111
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:14,550
he drank all the stolen divine wine.

112
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:15,860
Why is there more?

113
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,510
I think

114
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:20,940
it must be given by Lu Lingfeng.

115
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:22,430
He loves wine

116
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:23,300
as much as his life.

117
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,220
Maybe he saved some.

118
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:27,420
Commander Su.

119
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:29,760
How to deal with him?

120
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:33,470
Su Wuming!

121
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:34,950
Help me! Help me!

122
00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:38,970
It's up to you. Chief Shen.

123
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:40,340
Su Wuming.

124
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:41,630
You're heartless.

125
00:06:41,690 --> 00:06:42,900
Then follow the rules.

126
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:43,530
Yes, sir.

127
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:45,730
Go!

128
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:47,050
What are you going to do to me?

129
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:47,960
When we get on the island,

130
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:50,000
you'll be thrown to the Swamp of Alligators

131
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:52,080
with those disobedient people.

132
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:52,980
No! No!

133
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:54,460
I don't have much meat on my body.

134
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:56,220
If you want to throw me,

135
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,450
Su Wuming should also be thrown into the swamp with me.

136
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:59,500
What kind of guest is this?

137
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:00,570
I treated him well with good wine and meat!

138
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:02,510
What a waste!

139
00:07:13,710 --> 00:07:15,860
Where can I find the Blood Silkworm Tree?

140
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:18,040
Su Wuming.

141
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:19,380
How can you be so sure

142
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:20,560
that the tree is on this island?

143
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:32,539
Is this the Blood Silkworm Tree?

144
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,700
They're roaring outside.

145
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:46,740
Why don't you draw now?

146
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:47,590
What are you doing?

147
00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:50,090
I need to add some fish glue to the pigment

148
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:52,550
so that it won't lose colours in water

149
00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:53,530
or diffuse in sweat

150
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:55,430
Otherwise, it will be gone

151
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:56,340
when you want to see it.

152
00:08:58,410 --> 00:08:59,380
She's so smart.

153
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:53,150
Let's go.

154
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,480
Please.

155
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:06,130
Please.

156
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:31,360
May the Shrine prosper

157
00:11:31,510 --> 00:11:33,710
for eternity.

158
00:11:35,410 --> 00:11:37,060
Under the protection of Tuo God,

159
00:11:37,490 --> 00:11:39,170
the weather in the south is favorable,

160
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:40,950
and the people live in peace.

161
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:41,960
However...

162
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:44,900
What's going on?

163
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:47,250
There are people who forget their ancestors

164
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:48,410
and break their faith.

165
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:49,790
They desecrate the god

166
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,180
and fight against the Shrine.

167
00:11:51,530 --> 00:11:53,960
Today, they will be thrown to the Swamp of Alligators

168
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:55,510
to protect the fundamental law.

169
00:11:57,270 --> 00:11:59,600
The tea merchant Lu Yong

170
00:11:59,890 --> 00:12:00,980
set up a chamber of commerce without permission

171
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:02,940
to fight against the Shrine.

172
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:04,050
Now he has been arrested.

173
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:07,020
Chicken Fed

174
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:08,950
drank divine wine without permission.

175
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:11,420
These two are guilty.

176
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,040
Now God has given us enlightenment

177
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:16,600
to throw them alive into the Swamp of Alligators.

178
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:18,540
The Worshippers of Tuo God is so vicious

179
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:20,270
because the previous prefectural governors

180
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:21,420
all became your running dogs

181
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:22,900
frightened by your power.

182
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:24,620
I, Lu Yong,

183
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,290
will die for the people of Ninghu.

184
00:12:28,370 --> 00:12:29,270
The only pity is that

185
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:30,990
I can't kill the evil god myself.

186
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,070
How dare you, Lu Yong!

187
00:12:32,570 --> 00:12:35,080
How dare you talk nonsense in the face of imminent death?

188
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:36,380
Su Wuming.

189
00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:38,420
Will you save me or not?

190
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:46,780
The country

191
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:48,410
has its own laws.

192
00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:50,600
[Minister of Justice of Ninghu Song Jiangbo]

193
00:12:49,170 --> 00:12:51,090
What right does the Shrine have

194
00:12:51,410 --> 00:12:52,730
to decide life and death?

195
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:53,940
Song Jiangbo!

196
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:56,420
Song Jiangbo!

197
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:58,100
How dare you!

198
00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:00,100
I'm the Minister of Justice.

199
00:13:00,810 --> 00:13:03,720
The rites and music, sacrifices and funerals of Ninghu

200
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,080
are all my responsibilities.

201
00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:06,780
Tuo God! Tuo God!

202
00:13:07,170 --> 00:13:08,290
There are so many alligators

203
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:10,510
in the lake.

204
00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:12,770
I just want to ask

205
00:13:13,490 --> 00:13:14,140
where

206
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:15,550
is the god?

207
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,550
God is in your heart.

208
00:13:19,510 --> 00:13:20,640
Without God in your heart,

209
00:13:22,530 --> 00:13:23,840
it's easy to go to the island,

210
00:13:24,690 --> 00:13:25,810
but hard to leave.

211
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:26,900
Don't scare me.

212
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,040
No God

213
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:30,660
has the authority to decide our fate.

214
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,510
I have God's will.

215
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:34,010
I descend to Ninghu

216
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:35,820
to protect the people of the state.

217
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:39,710
What officials are roaring here today?

218
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:44,440
Why...

219
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:46,690
Why did Tuo God speak?

220
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:47,900
Tuo God has appeared.

221
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:49,540
Tuo God has appeared!

222
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:51,860
Tuo God has appeared!

223
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:53,500
Do you believe me now?

224
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:55,950
I am an official of the imperial court.

225
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:58,220
He doesn't dare to do anything to me.

226
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:01,680
How should I punish him?

227
00:14:01,770 --> 00:14:02,770
Please tell me, my God.

228
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:05,470
Throw them into the Swamp of Alligators.

229
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:06,390
Yes.

230
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:10,530
Tuo God.

231
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:12,260
You have no right to do this.

232
00:14:12,630 --> 00:14:14,220
You have no right!

233
00:14:14,590 --> 00:14:15,690
Bastard!

234
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,430
Tuo God!

235
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:20,840
Where is Gu Wenbin?

236
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:23,240
I'm here.

237
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:26,980
You've been an administrator for many years.

238
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:29,210
You can be the acting prefectural governor today.

239
00:14:29,430 --> 00:14:31,310
If you respect the destiny of heaven,

240
00:14:31,590 --> 00:14:33,580
I can guarantee that Ninghu will be fine

241
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:35,380
and the people can live happily.

242
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:37,750
It's hard to escape from the eyes of heaven

243
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:39,130
if any arrogant person dares to

244
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:42,020
fight against the Shrine and agree outwardly but disagree inwardly.

245
00:14:42,210 --> 00:14:45,810
Then the whole state will be doomed eternally.

246
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,280
In the future,

247
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,190
I will strictly discipline my subordinates.

248
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:51,340
We dare not do it again.

249
00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:56,750
Who is behind you?

250
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:01,510
My god, it's Su Wuming.

251
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:02,660
He's calling you.

252
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:05,260
Su Wuming.

253
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:07,900
Do you admit your crime?

254
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:09,010
What's his crime?

255
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:19,470
Is it because

256
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:20,500
I drank Tuo God Wine?

257
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:22,340
Who are you?

258
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:25,770
I'm the personal staff of Ninghu's commander,

259
00:15:26,710 --> 00:15:27,830
Lu Lingfeng.

260
00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:28,970
Lu Lingfeng!

261
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:31,240
You didn't die from falling off the cliff.

262
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:32,080
Take him down.

263
00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:32,640
Yes.

264
00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:33,220
Wait!

265
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:42,570
Just now when you monster

266
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:43,570
started to talk,

267
00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:45,650
you really scared me.

268
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:47,620
I think every Ninghu person

269
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:50,020
who has seen this scene for the first time

270
00:15:50,310 --> 00:15:52,750
would believe that

271
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,710
there is a living god

272
00:15:55,110 --> 00:15:57,190
on the Island of Tuo God in Ninghu.

273
00:15:58,130 --> 00:15:59,970
So they are willing to

274
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,470
worship and respect you.

275
00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:03,860
But after you've been on top

276
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:05,090
for years,

277
00:16:05,610 --> 00:16:08,970
you really think you are a god.

278
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:10,170
Shut up!

279
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:12,080
How dare you say that?

280
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:13,420
Su Wuming, are you crazy?

281
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:17,130
You're really so arrogant.

282
00:16:17,450 --> 00:16:18,490
You should be dead!

283
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:19,900
Shut up!

284
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:24,520
Whoever opposes you

285
00:16:25,090 --> 00:16:27,430
will be killed by you.

286
00:16:27,450 --> 00:16:29,260
Not only merchants,

287
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:31,830
but also commanders and ministers,

288
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:34,460
how many of them died of allligators?

289
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:36,310
Governor Li

290
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:38,870
has discovered your evil deeds

291
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:41,780
and wrote the Records of Worshippers of Tuo God.

292
00:16:41,930 --> 00:16:43,650
He wrote everything

293
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:44,880
clearly.

294
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,040
However,

295
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:48,790
he also made

296
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:50,460
a fatal mistake.

297
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:52,820
That is to ignore

298
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:54,500
Minister Zeng

299
00:16:54,530 --> 00:16:57,520
who seems to oppose the Worshippers of Tuo God.

300
00:16:58,070 --> 00:16:59,500
What? Minister Zeng?

301
00:16:59,770 --> 00:17:01,440
Mr. Zeng works for the Shrine?

302
00:17:01,610 --> 00:17:02,270
It's him?

303
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:03,930
No way.

304
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:06,310
Su Wuming, you're talking nonsense.

305
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:07,980
There is no Records of Worshippers of Tuo God.

306
00:17:08,609 --> 00:17:11,190
You sent someone to steal one

307
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:12,730
at the villa by the lake.

308
00:17:12,770 --> 00:17:14,770
And you got another one

309
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,450
from Administrator Gu.

310
00:17:16,819 --> 00:17:18,780
You're still pretending not to know?

311
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:21,030
Su Wuming, don't talk nonsense.

312
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Even if you don't admit both of them,

313
00:17:27,730 --> 00:17:30,210
I have the third one here.

314
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:33,110
Governor Li

315
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:34,830
personally gave it to me.

316
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:37,240
Where is Li Yu?

317
00:17:37,370 --> 00:17:39,560
He is in this hall.

318
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:42,300
Where is he?

319
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:43,620
Where is he?

320
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:44,590
Where is the prefectural governor?

321
00:17:48,730 --> 00:17:50,630
Governor Li is dead.

322
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:53,150
But the Records of Worshippers of Tuo God

323
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:55,080
is the fruit of his painstaking labour.

324
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:56,780
This record is here,

325
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:59,520
which means he is also in this hall

326
00:17:59,770 --> 00:18:01,930
with us.

327
00:18:03,810 --> 00:18:07,470
You are making up a story. What crime should you bear?

328
00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:10,350
Zeng Sanyi.

329
00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:13,680
Don't you show your true self?

330
00:18:17,170 --> 00:18:18,520
You mean the Tuo God

331
00:18:19,210 --> 00:18:20,280
is Mr. Zeng?

332
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:22,810
How is that possible?

333
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:24,040
Commander Su.

334
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:25,830
You can't make things up.

335
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:26,700
That's right.

336
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:27,480
This is crazy.

337
00:18:27,810 --> 00:18:29,800
Tuo God's anger will overturn the whole city.

338
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:31,510
Kowtow and make amends! Hurry!

339
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:32,880
Apologize to Tuo God.

340
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:33,800
Apologize!

341
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:34,860
Hurry up!

342
00:18:35,130 --> 00:18:36,340
I, Su Wuming,

343
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:39,500
am not that good at investigating cases,

344
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:42,900
but my ears are particularly sharp.

345
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:45,150
Although you deliberately

346
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,540
tried to hide it when you started to talk,

347
00:18:47,650 --> 00:18:49,870
I could immediately tell

348
00:18:50,050 --> 00:18:51,090
it was your voice,

349
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:53,090
Zeng Sanyi.

350
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:57,940
I really didn't suspect you

351
00:18:57,940 --> 00:18:59,740
at the beginning.

352
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:02,170
Even if Lu Lingfeng and I

353
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,850
were attacked at the villa by the lake.

354
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:06,330
You even used Minister He

355
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,080
to lure us to Hanshan.

356
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:10,800
I thought these were all coincidences.

357
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:13,940
I even thought

358
00:19:15,370 --> 00:19:17,850
Administrator Gu was more suspicious.

359
00:19:18,410 --> 00:19:19,060
Me?

360
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:24,720
Before Governor Li committed suicide,

361
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,500
he said

362
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:28,990
the record he put at the villa by the lake was stolen.

363
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:30,700
Before that,

364
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:33,630
the Shrine had always trusted him.

365
00:19:34,570 --> 00:19:37,100
Governor Li wrote the records secretly.

366
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:39,320
Who would know that?

367
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:42,300
I looked through the Records of Worshippers of Tuo God

368
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,170
and found that except for the cases of trampling people like mud and ashes,

369
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:46,380
the most recorded things

370
00:19:46,670 --> 00:19:47,680
are all

371
00:19:47,710 --> 00:19:50,160
tax accounts of extortion.

372
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:51,540
And only the Minister of Warehouse, Zeng Sanyi,

373
00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:54,610
who is responsible for the collection

374
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,840
knew it best.

375
00:19:56,980 --> 00:19:57,810
Wait. Wait.

376
00:19:58,690 --> 00:19:59,350
Commander Su.

377
00:19:59,690 --> 00:20:01,080
What are you trying to say?

378
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:03,790
Governor Li wrote records.

379
00:20:03,990 --> 00:20:04,750
It was impossible for him

380
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:07,740
to ask the Shrine for detailed accounts.

381
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:09,470
He could only go to the government office

382
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:12,320
of the Minister of Warehouse to investigate.

383
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:13,210
And this

384
00:20:13,690 --> 00:20:16,050
aroused the suspicions of Zeng Sanyi.

385
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:20,900
That's just your deduction.

386
00:20:22,530 --> 00:20:23,270
Indeed.

387
00:20:24,150 --> 00:20:27,120
This is just my suspection.

388
00:20:28,130 --> 00:20:31,060
The person who made Tuo God show his true colors

389
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:32,820
was his subordinate,

390
00:20:33,390 --> 00:20:34,390
Shen Chong.

391
00:20:35,930 --> 00:20:36,400
I...

392
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:39,390
Do you still remember

393
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:41,490
what Shen Chong said

394
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:43,520
at Zeng Sanyi's retirement banquet?

395
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:47,260
Zeng Sanyi!

396
00:20:48,970 --> 00:20:50,530
Every time when it comes to the Tuo God Ceremony,

397
00:20:50,550 --> 00:20:51,420
you must have something

398
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:52,220
to do.

399
00:20:52,790 --> 00:20:53,920
I think

400
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:55,140
you are deliberately against the Shrine!

401
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:58,200
Zeng Sanyi was the senior statesman in the city.

402
00:20:58,710 --> 00:21:00,740
But he never attends

403
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:01,970
the annual God Sighting Ceremony.

404
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:03,940
People can see this as

405
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:05,820
that he doesn't care about Tuo God.

406
00:21:05,850 --> 00:21:06,890
But in fact,

407
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:09,780
how can the Tuo God on the altar behind the scenes

408
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,860
separate himself?

409
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:13,550
Over the years,

410
00:21:13,890 --> 00:21:15,650
so many officials have lost their lives.

411
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:17,820
While Mr. Zeng who disdains Tuo God

412
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:19,370
can retire

413
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:20,380
safe and sound.

414
00:21:20,430 --> 00:21:22,420
Isn't that weird?

415
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:24,940
It does make sense.

416
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:25,580
Yes.

417
00:21:25,690 --> 00:21:28,530
Zeng Sanyi built up a fortune in Hanshan.

418
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:29,620
So people there

419
00:21:29,650 --> 00:21:30,840
can drink Tuo God Wine.

420
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:33,120
Isn't that the proof?

421
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:35,870
That's right.

422
00:21:36,530 --> 00:21:37,900
After the retirement banquet,

423
00:21:38,190 --> 00:21:40,930
I even asked Chicken Fed to send gifts.

424
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:42,370
As soon as he entered

425
00:21:42,410 --> 00:21:43,770
Zeng Sanyi's room,

426
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:44,780
he smelled

427
00:21:44,810 --> 00:21:47,220
the strong aroma of Tuo God Wine.

428
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:48,510
Yes.

429
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:50,710
I smelt it immediately.

430
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:52,460
There is no need to send a gift.

431
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:55,460
Commander Su is so considerate.

432
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:57,460
He admires you.

433
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:59,480
Because in Ninghu,

434
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:01,670
not many people

435
00:22:01,990 --> 00:22:03,270
who dare to disdain the Shrine!

436
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:17,530
Zeng Sanyi.

437
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:20,050
You love drinking.

438
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:23,090
In the end, what made you fall from the altar

439
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:26,860
is the special hobby that you can't change.

440
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:28,950
Who is qualified

441
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:32,540
to drink Tuo God Wine every day in Ninghu?

442
00:22:41,930 --> 00:22:42,750
It's still impossible.

443
00:22:44,210 --> 00:22:45,020
Zeng Sanyi

444
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:46,460
is short.

445
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:47,790
And he is humpbacked.

446
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:50,480
Tuo God's true body is so tall

447
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:52,030
and is full of power and grandeur.

448
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:55,750
The person I worship every time

449
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,020
can't be Zeng Sanyi.

450
00:22:59,290 --> 00:23:00,930
The secret is

451
00:23:01,370 --> 00:23:04,710
the red curtain in front of him.

452
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:06,960
Lu Lingfeng.

453
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:08,300
Have you found it?

454
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:16,480
This is the Hitholon Tree, Tianzhu's specialty,

455
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:18,940
and also known as the leaves of the Blood Silkworm Tree.

456
00:23:19,610 --> 00:23:23,300
This tree's resin can make fine gauze.

457
00:23:23,470 --> 00:23:25,650
The gauze is not only half transparent,

458
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:27,020
but can also

459
00:23:27,510 --> 00:23:30,320
magnify figures several times under high temperatures.

460
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:34,810
This is the reason

461
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:37,790
why there are fires on both sides of the hall.

462
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:41,510
Our city is located in the lake,

463
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:42,810
and there are all kinds of alligators.

464
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,970
So I asked Lu Lingfeng

465
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,960
to come to the island to investigate.

466
00:23:48,170 --> 00:23:50,960
Sure enough, he found it.

467
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:53,220
You asked him to steal the wine

468
00:23:53,770 --> 00:23:55,010
just to go to the island?

469
00:23:56,750 --> 00:23:58,130
It's just a small trick.

470
00:23:59,250 --> 00:24:00,130
Zeng Sanyi,

471
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:03,300
you hold the Epiphany Ceremony

472
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:04,220
and the God Sighting Ceremony every year

473
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:06,660
just to show your gigantic figure

474
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:09,710
to the people of Ninghu.

475
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:11,510
So that they can believe

476
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:13,250
there is really a god in this world,

477
00:24:13,490 --> 00:24:15,860
and you can use this to control them.

478
00:24:16,670 --> 00:24:17,290
I think

479
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:20,040
no one in the world knows

480
00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:22,780
who you really are

481
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:24,340
besides your left and right Guardians.

482
00:24:26,210 --> 00:24:28,330
And your left and right Guardians should be

483
00:24:28,390 --> 00:24:29,650
the killers you took in

484
00:24:29,730 --> 00:24:32,260
when you were in Hanshan.

485
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:34,060
That's why they

486
00:24:34,570 --> 00:24:36,030
stay loyal to you.

487
00:24:41,530 --> 00:24:44,330
Today, let the people and the officials of Ninghu

488
00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:46,820
to see

489
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:49,300
the true face of the Tuo God!

490
00:24:50,170 --> 00:24:51,620
Lu Lingfeng!

491
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:18,200
This, this...

492
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:34,380
Mr. Zeng.

493
00:25:36,730 --> 00:25:38,730
It's really you, Zeng Sanyi!

494
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:41,130
I've been kneeling before the Tuo God for so many years.

495
00:25:41,590 --> 00:25:43,290
But you are the one I've been kneeling for！

496
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:47,990
Here, smear some more.

497
00:25:48,350 --> 00:25:49,660
Come on. More！

498
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:51,020
Let me help you.

499
00:25:51,060 --> 00:25:52,660
The alligators won't bite you after you are covered with it.

500
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:54,410
I believe what Commander Su said.

501
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:54,960
Up there, Up.

502
00:25:55,070 --> 00:25:55,840
Let me smear it for you.

503
00:26:08,170 --> 00:26:10,010
Hurry up. Hurry!

504
00:26:10,370 --> 00:26:10,930
My lady,

505
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:12,590
all the Tianzhu Incense in Ninghu

506
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:14,140
is on our boat.

507
00:26:14,230 --> 00:26:15,190
It's too heavy.

508
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:16,770
This is the fastest speed we can row.

509
00:26:16,810 --> 00:26:17,370
I don't care!

510
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:18,540
The safety of all people in Ninghu

511
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:19,550
is in our hands.

512
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:20,880
We have to send it to them as soon as possible!

513
00:26:20,910 --> 00:26:21,390
Yes!

514
00:26:57,470 --> 00:26:59,230
I, Zeng Sanyi,

515
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,200
was born from a poor family.

516
00:27:01,510 --> 00:27:03,040
I studied hard.

517
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:06,100
I was at the top of every exam.

518
00:27:08,370 --> 00:27:09,540
But every time,

519
00:27:11,210 --> 00:27:12,880
I fell behind the last person in the imperial exam.

520
00:27:16,270 --> 00:27:18,140
Because I have no family background,

521
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:21,360
I'm ugly

522
00:27:22,950 --> 00:27:24,140
and a hunchback.

523
00:27:25,210 --> 00:27:27,500
The chief examiners said

524
00:27:27,610 --> 00:27:31,660
I was a disgrace to the government.

525
00:27:34,310 --> 00:27:36,790
I am full of proposals to rule the country,

526
00:27:36,910 --> 00:27:38,780
but I have nowhere to use them.

527
00:27:39,810 --> 00:27:42,420
I could only stay in Ninghu

528
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:48,050
and become a mere Minister of Warehouse.

529
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:50,800
I'm not convinced!

530
00:27:53,930 --> 00:27:55,290
The reason 30 years ago,

531
00:27:57,950 --> 00:28:00,550
I appeared in the name of the Tuo God,

532
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:03,760
was to make those officials,

533
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:06,680
especially those

534
00:28:07,070 --> 00:28:10,230
with a high family background,

535
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:14,580
kneel in front of me.

536
00:28:15,490 --> 00:28:18,260
But when you get used to being superior

537
00:28:18,570 --> 00:28:20,620
and being worshipped,

538
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:22,720
and when you even think it's an offense to you

539
00:28:22,810 --> 00:28:25,580
when other people take a sip of the Tuo God Wine,

540
00:28:26,930 --> 00:28:27,580
you

541
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:30,590
are no longer who you were.

542
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:31,630
Shut up!

543
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:35,640
Where are the disciples of the Tuo God?

544
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:36,460
Yes!

545
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:39,890
Kill them all.

546
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:42,390
I'll give you all the money

547
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:43,310
I've been saving for 30 years.

548
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:45,990
If you want to be an official, kill them.

549
00:28:46,050 --> 00:28:47,600
Then you can take their position.

550
00:28:48,010 --> 00:28:49,470
As long as you do it well,

551
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:52,060
it's not difficult to replace them.

552
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:53,990
Tuo God is wise!

553
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:55,350
Disciples of the Tuo God,

554
00:28:55,580 --> 00:28:56,580
protect our God!

555
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:59,120
So we can become government officials and get rich! Kill!

556
00:28:59,150 --> 00:29:02,990
Kill!

557
00:29:08,410 --> 00:29:09,260
Run!

558
00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:12,700
Run! Run!

559
00:29:24,630 --> 00:29:25,270
Gu Wenbin!

560
00:29:25,570 --> 00:29:26,360
Where are you going?

561
00:29:26,970 --> 00:29:28,930
Although you're not one of them,

562
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,600
you've always spoken for them

563
00:29:30,670 --> 00:29:32,220
so that you can hold an office and enjoy all the privileges without doing a stroke of work.

564
00:29:32,250 --> 00:29:33,950
It's time for you to make contributions!

565
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:34,960
No, I...

566
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:36,550
Do you forget who you are!

567
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:45,460
The people of Ninghu!

568
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:47,410
Gu Wenbin is here,

569
00:29:47,790 --> 00:29:50,470
to wipe out the evil cult with you all!

570
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:22,160
I'll untie it for you.

571
00:30:22,190 --> 00:30:22,540
OK.

572
00:30:22,650 --> 00:30:23,650
Thank you, Commander Su.

573
00:30:25,710 --> 00:30:26,710
Me!

574
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:28,560
Why don't you untie me first?

575
00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:18,780
Where are you going, Cheif?

576
00:31:19,310 --> 00:31:20,320
Mo Le.

577
00:31:21,050 --> 00:31:21,450
You!

578
00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:24,500
Don't underestimate

579
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:25,700
the Minister of Justice of Ninghu!

580
00:31:52,930 --> 00:31:53,440
How is it?

581
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:54,800
Did you catch Zeng Sanyi?

582
00:31:55,230 --> 00:31:55,670
We've searched everywhere.

583
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:56,820
But there is no sign of him.

584
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:00,940
Where can he run!

585
00:32:24,570 --> 00:32:25,500
Be careful!

586
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:11,080
Now that you're in my Swamp of Alligators,

587
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:13,030
you won't get out alive.

588
00:33:25,790 --> 00:33:27,220
Mere humans

589
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:29,990
want to fight my giant alligators?

590
00:33:45,330 --> 00:33:46,050
Master!

591
00:33:47,590 --> 00:33:48,390
Sir!

592
00:33:48,690 --> 00:33:49,430
Lu Lingfeng!

593
00:33:49,730 --> 00:33:50,500
Xijun!

594
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:51,300
Hurry!

595
00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:53,060
Tianzhu Incense!

596
00:33:54,090 --> 00:33:55,560
You're finally here!

597
00:33:55,730 --> 00:33:56,800
If you were a little late,

598
00:33:56,830 --> 00:33:58,910
we would be the food of the alligators.

599
00:33:59,950 --> 00:34:02,000
Hurry up, light the incense!

600
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:52,199
That old bastard is over there.

601
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:56,210
Yingtao.

602
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:02,960
Yingtao!

603
00:35:08,060 --> 00:35:09,000
I'll catch him!

604
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:18,010
Mo Le!

605
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:23,730
Lu Lingfeng! Your spear!

606
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:11,090
Yingtao!

607
00:36:12,710 --> 00:36:13,780
Su Wuming,

608
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:16,210
you saved me once.

609
00:36:18,250 --> 00:36:19,080
I'll pay you back

610
00:36:20,130 --> 00:36:21,290
with my life.

611
00:36:22,510 --> 00:36:23,510
Fed!

612
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:26,460
Help!

613
00:36:29,330 --> 00:36:30,950
My father studied hard when he was young.

614
00:36:32,070 --> 00:36:32,770
But he failed

615
00:36:33,550 --> 00:36:35,070
every imperial examination.

616
00:36:36,770 --> 00:36:37,660
15 years ago,

617
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:40,170
after my father failed again,

618
00:36:41,860 --> 00:36:44,590
he returned to his hometown from Chang'an.

619
00:36:45,090 --> 00:36:45,750
But he found

620
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:49,230
my mother was raped and murdered

621
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:50,140
by Li Yu.

622
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:53,820
The Li family bribed the government.

623
00:36:54,470 --> 00:36:55,220
And the government arrested my servant,

624
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:56,690
Chu Si,

625
00:36:56,710 --> 00:36:57,970
who reported to the government.

626
00:36:59,620 --> 00:37:01,550
They poured iron into his throat

627
00:37:03,690 --> 00:37:04,710
to make him to lose his voice.

628
00:37:05,330 --> 00:37:06,410
So he was mute.

629
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:08,380
But he still can hear.

630
00:37:11,580 --> 00:37:12,800
I was only four back then.

631
00:37:14,570 --> 00:37:15,880
My father was just a scholar.

632
00:37:16,530 --> 00:37:17,550
And he didn't dare take revenge

633
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:19,750
for fear something would happen to me.

634
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:22,480
He took me to another place away from home.

635
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:27,220
Later, he left me to my master

636
00:37:28,430 --> 00:37:30,750
and he went back to our hometown for revenge.

637
00:37:32,290 --> 00:37:33,170
He failed?

638
00:37:36,740 --> 00:37:37,650
He only knew

639
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:39,650
when he came back

640
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:41,730
that Li Yu had moved to Luoyang.

641
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:45,080
Chu Si, who became a beggar,

642
00:37:45,790 --> 00:37:47,110
persuaded my father to continue to study hard.

643
00:37:48,410 --> 00:37:49,860
There would be a day for our revenge.

644
00:37:51,430 --> 00:37:52,500
But ironically,

645
00:37:53,930 --> 00:37:55,110
my father still failed many times.

646
00:37:56,110 --> 00:37:59,110
However he had learned that the murderer Li Yu

647
00:38:00,570 --> 00:38:02,210
bought an imperial position, the informal official.

648
00:38:04,450 --> 00:38:05,730
My father was furious

649
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:08,750
and followed Li Yu to the south secretly.

650
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:10,460
He found a chance to poison him to death

651
00:38:12,260 --> 00:38:14,100
and falsified the official tablet.

652
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:15,870
He brought Chu Si

653
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:18,110
to Ninghu.

654
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:24,710
What are you thinking?

655
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:30,560
Alligators are innocent.

656
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:35,260
What matters is the heart.

657
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:43,080
Just now,

658
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:45,730
you asked me to release all the alligators

659
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:48,310
in the underground swamp.

660
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:50,130
This is your good intentions.

661
00:38:54,870 --> 00:38:57,620
At the riverside lies the alligators' home.

662
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:01,490
People and creatures

663
00:39:02,110 --> 00:39:04,040
should get along with each other.

664
00:39:04,810 --> 00:39:07,240
This is the natural law.

665
00:39:20,870 --> 00:39:21,390
Come on.

666
00:39:21,510 --> 00:39:24,030
Let's make a toast to Commander Su!

667
00:39:24,340 --> 00:39:24,930
Without him,

668
00:39:25,250 --> 00:39:26,760
how can we drink

669
00:39:26,980 --> 00:39:28,120
the Tuo God wine?

670
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:29,300
Yes, yes.

671
00:39:29,330 --> 00:39:30,380
To Commander Su! To Commander Su!

672
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:31,380
To Commander Su!

673
00:39:31,770 --> 00:39:33,840
Although the wine is good,

674
00:39:34,250 --> 00:39:37,170
we can't drink too much.

675
00:39:38,580 --> 00:39:39,960
Although the Shrine has been uprooted,

676
00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:42,940
all the  affairs in the city

677
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:44,210
are piled up.

678
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:45,380
Commander Su!

679
00:39:48,780 --> 00:39:49,750
By your order,

680
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:52,100
we have brought the documents of the evil cult.

681
00:39:52,660 --> 00:39:53,900
Who's a member of the cult

682
00:39:54,340 --> 00:39:55,600
and who has worked for them,

683
00:39:56,090 --> 00:39:57,720
which are all documented clearly.

684
00:40:07,790 --> 00:40:11,820
I think you all live in Ninghu

685
00:40:12,130 --> 00:40:14,540
and are well familiar with the situation here.

686
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:16,830
Now the things are waiting to prosper.

687
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:18,210
The people in Ninghu

688
00:40:19,130 --> 00:40:21,100
need you all.

689
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:23,630
Since the top evil has been eliminated,

690
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:26,450
these things

691
00:40:27,310 --> 00:40:29,190
should just be burned.

692
00:40:45,810 --> 00:40:47,190
To Commander Su.

693
00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:49,300
We can drink the wine.

694
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:51,520
But should we

695
00:40:51,540 --> 00:40:52,820
change the name of this wine?

696
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:57,730
The wine was originally called the Nantian Wine.

697
00:40:57,750 --> 00:40:59,000
How about we changing it back?

698
00:40:59,190 --> 00:40:59,780
Good!

699
00:41:00,370 --> 00:41:00,960
Change it back!

700
00:41:01,670 --> 00:41:02,330
Cheers!

701
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:03,210
Cheers! Cheers!

702
00:41:06,610 --> 00:41:07,300
Okay.

703
00:41:09,460 --> 00:41:10,580
There's enough for everyone.

704
00:41:12,180 --> 00:41:12,820
Don't worry.

705
00:41:13,060 --> 00:41:14,400
Two jars, right? Don't worry.

706
00:41:14,710 --> 00:41:15,990
Yes. Next.

707
00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:16,610
Come on.

708
00:41:16,930 --> 00:41:17,840
Next.

709
00:41:18,110 --> 00:41:19,570
Line up here.

710
00:41:19,590 --> 00:41:20,210
All of you.

711
00:41:20,780 --> 00:41:21,660
Give me a jar.

712
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:22,350
Take it.

713
00:41:33,170 --> 00:41:33,630
Sir!

714
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:35,250
Did you drink?

715
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:36,260
Yes.

716
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:37,940
And I drank a lot!

717
00:41:40,430 --> 00:41:41,080
Look!

718
00:42:05,140 --> 00:42:09,030
[Tomb of Li Yu, Governor of Ninghu]

719
00:42:07,070 --> 00:42:08,480
What is wirtten on tombstone,

720
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:10,960
is your father's idea?

721
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:14,210
He's been a scholar all his life.

722
00:42:16,770 --> 00:42:17,410
In the end,

723
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:21,040
he can only do something for the people

724
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:24,470
in his enemy's name.

725
00:42:31,190 --> 00:42:32,350
This is from Prefectural Governor Gao of Luozhou,

726
00:42:32,430 --> 00:42:33,370
who sent someone from Dongdu

727
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:34,560
in an urgent.

728
00:42:34,780 --> 00:42:36,600
The messenger said the imperial court ordered you

729
00:42:36,620 --> 00:42:37,720
to go to Luoyang immediately.

730
00:42:38,740 --> 00:42:39,740
Where is the messenger?

731
00:42:40,170 --> 00:42:40,970
He's already back.

732
00:42:43,980 --> 00:42:45,160
I was hoping to

733
00:42:45,180 --> 00:42:46,280
govern this city with you.

734
00:42:46,940 --> 00:42:47,900
I didn't expect that you would

735
00:42:48,010 --> 00:42:49,310
return to the north so soon.

736
00:42:50,140 --> 00:42:52,180
I think you are going to be promoted to an important position.

737
00:42:52,420 --> 00:42:53,630
If that's the case,

738
00:42:53,660 --> 00:42:55,350
how could it be the prefectural governor of Luozhou

739
00:42:55,380 --> 00:42:56,280
who wrote to me,

740
00:42:56,300 --> 00:42:58,040
in the name of the imperial court.

741
00:42:59,170 --> 00:43:00,870
This is so strange!

742
00:43:01,610 --> 00:43:04,000
Then will you go?

743
00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:06,290
Things are weird.

744
00:43:07,050 --> 00:43:09,320
I should go to Dongdu immediately

745
