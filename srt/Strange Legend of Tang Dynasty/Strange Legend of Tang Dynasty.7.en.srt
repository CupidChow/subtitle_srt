General.

5
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:14,290
Fed was healing me last night,

6
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:15,740
he must be exhausted,

7
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:17,050
just let him sleep.

Guo Zhuang.

9
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:22,420
I know you didn't mean it

10
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:23,410
last night.

11
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:24,820
You were born in a poor family.

12
00:02:25,329 --> 00:02:26,450
Joining the Imperial Guards

13
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:28,120
has brought honor to your whole family.

14
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:30,410
How can you simply quit?

15
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:33,270
You are brave and loyal.

16
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:34,410
You might be a successful man

17
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:36,329
if you encounter some opportunities in the future.

18
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:37,960
General, please don't say that,

19
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:39,520
I dare not think about it.

20
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:42,110
I'm a commoner now,

21
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:44,100
don't call me General anymore.

22
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:45,920
From now on,

23
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:47,579
you and I are sworn brothers.

24
00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:49,020
Brother Guo Zhuang,

25
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:50,500
you must be tired of carrying me

26
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,560
last night.

27
00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:53,740
Please accept my deepest gratitude.

28
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:54,420
General,

29
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:55,880
I don't deserve this.

30
00:02:57,740 --> 00:02:58,360
My brother,

31
00:02:58,670 --> 00:02:59,060
get up.

32
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:03,900
Go back now.

33
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:05,300
Where are you going?

34
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:07,580
What if Great General regrets in the future,

35
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:09,040
where can we find you?

36
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:15,100
His Highness was the one who dismissed me.

37
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:16,829
The one who expelled me,

38
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:18,400
was His Highness too.

39
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:20,300
It has nothing to do with Lu Tong.

40
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:32,180
The leaves fall surprisingly as the early autumn arrives,

41
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:37,010
adrift just like the wanderer's heart.

42
00:03:39,170 --> 00:03:40,200
From now on, I'm afraid that

43
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,800
I can only wander around from place to place.

44
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:47,300
I know you don't have money,

45
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:49,810
we've gathered some for you.

46
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:51,500
Take it.

47
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:54,290
I can't accept it.

48
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:55,420
If you really think of me as your brother,

49
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:56,100
take it.

50
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:18,899
Uncle Qian.

51
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:21,910
Look at this weird-looking flower,

52
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:23,890
I haven't seen one before.

53
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:25,470
I haven't seen one before either.

54
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:27,020
It's not recorded in your book as well,

55
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,360
I'll grind the ink for you now.

56
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:34,340
Move!

57
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:39,460
Woman!

58
00:04:39,659 --> 00:04:41,370
How dare you assassinate an imperial official?

59
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:43,000
How dare you!

60
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:47,100
Lady Shiyi.

61
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,260
I am Lady Shiyi who is trying to kill you.

62
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:50,390
You just said

63
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:51,780
you liked the flowers and plants here?

64
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:53,180
Great.

65
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:55,620
This place will be your grave.

66
00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:00,020
Our grudges for each other

67
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:01,860
has nothing to do with my servant.

68
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:03,060
How about letting him go first?

69
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:05,160
Military Commander, what did you just say?

70
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:07,220
Uncle Qian, listen to me. Run!

71
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:08,420
Why should I run?

72
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:09,630
She's just a woman,

73
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:10,740
what can she do to us?

74
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,450
I have a knife!

75
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:14,890
Get lost!

76
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:15,840
Otherwise,

77
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:17,980
don't blame me for being merciless.

78
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:21,010
Old man.

79
00:05:21,890 --> 00:05:23,750
You seem loyal to him.

80
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:25,120
I'll grant your wish,

81
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:27,220
and let you die with him.

82
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:27,780
Uncle Qian.

83
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:29,980
If you insist to kill,

84
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:31,820
don't blame me for being rude.

85
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,860
If I'm not mistaken,

86
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:40,260
Gentleman Shiyi who is known to be invincible

87
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:42,900
and is responsible for the evildoings in the Ghost Market,

88
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,210
it's you, isn't it?

89
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:50,740
Yes, but so what?

90
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:11,690
This demon is evil,

91
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:12,780
run, Uncle Qian!

92
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:13,540
No.

93
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:14,810
Even if I die,

94
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,010
I will die along with you.

95
00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:18,100
Give me the knife and

96
00:06:18,130 --> 00:06:18,850
run!

97
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:23,940
Uncle Qian!

98
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:51,750
No!

99

Immortal Venerable,

100
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:22,220
I'll kill him now

101
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:24,400
and avenge you.

102
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:29,500
I've learned martial arts since young,

103
00:07:30,010 --> 00:07:31,410
just for the sake of living.

104
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:34,020
Later, half-man half-ghostly, I wandered here and there,

105
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:36,400
until I met the Immortal Venerable.

106
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:39,250
He not only treated me as a human,

107
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,050
but also highly valued me,

108
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:44,020
and let me live a carefree life in the Ghost Market.

109
00:07:44,470 --> 00:07:45,320
He also said that

110
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:47,340
if I can make a career

111
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:48,220
with Chang'an black tea,

112
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:49,680
he'll report to the Emperor

113
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:51,260
to make me the king of the Ghost Market.

114
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:53,740
But all of this

115
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:56,520
was ruined by you, Su Wuming!

116
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:58,060
I'll kill you!

117

118
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:18,800
You're injured.

119
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:24,940
How good it is.

120
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:26,890
Immortal Venerable,

121
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:28,690
your enemies are all here.

122
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:30,190
I'll kill them all

123
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:31,940
to pay tribute to your dead spirit.

124
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:39,740
Lu Lingfeng!

125
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,780
His disguising skill

126
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:26,290
is truly amazing.

127
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:28,400
This is his actual face.

128
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:29,840
He looks

129
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:31,530
a dozen years older than me.

Su Wuming!

133
00:09:39,530 --> 00:09:40,330
What are you doing?

134
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:41,500
He's dead.

135
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:43,440
He's dead!

[Tomb of Respected Elder, Su Qian]

Lu Lingfeng!

138
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,580
What are you doing?

139
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:31,490
Now I remember.

140
00:10:31,770 --> 00:10:32,290
W-What?

141
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:33,860
Last night you advised me to stay alive

142
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:35,890
to find and revenge

143
00:10:35,930 --> 00:10:36,400
the one who framed me.

144
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:38,900
Now my enemy is right in front of me.

145
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:40,560
Su Wuming,

146
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,660
I've buried Su Qian for you.

147
00:10:43,130 --> 00:10:44,230
After I kill you,

148
00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:45,900
I'll dig a hole and build a tomb for you

149
00:10:46,330 --> 00:10:48,020
next to his grave.

150
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:48,820
Wait,

151
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:49,420
Wait!

152
00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:50,360
Yes,

153
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:52,020
it's true that I'll get unlucky whenever

154
00:10:52,370 --> 00:10:53,780
I run into him.

155
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:56,270
But claiming that he framed you,

156
00:10:56,510 --> 00:10:56,860
this...

157
00:10:57,650 --> 00:10:58,580
this doesn't seem to be true.

158
00:10:58,730 --> 00:10:59,710
I received nothing but punishment,

159
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:00,460
but how about him?

160
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:02,910
He was promoted to the Military Commander of Nanzhou

161
00:11:03,170 --> 00:11:04,370
from a low-rank sherrif.

162
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:05,830
There is no such thing in this world!

163
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:08,380
Who else could it be

164
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:09,690
if it's not him who framed me?

165
00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:16,420
No wonder my teacher, Detective Di

166
00:11:16,450 --> 00:11:17,800
didn't take you as his disciple.

167
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:19,980
How dare you insult me when you're dying?

168
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:21,390
Su Wuming, you!

169
00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:23,390
Su Wuming,

170
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:25,220
he's getting irrational due to his anger right now.

171
00:11:25,370 --> 00:11:26,810
Please explain it to him.

172
00:11:27,330 --> 00:11:28,000
What he said

173
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:29,110
makes sense.

174
00:11:29,210 --> 00:11:29,600
Look,

175
00:11:29,710 --> 00:11:30,780
you're working on the same case.

176
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,460
Why was he dismissed

177
00:11:32,530 --> 00:11:33,370
and expelled from Chang'an,

178
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:35,040
but you got promoted and made a fortune?

179
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:35,990
Why?

180
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,170
There are a lot of things we don't understand

181
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,990
in this world.

182
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:45,500
But as time goes by,

183
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:48,230
the truth will be revealed sooner or later.

184
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:52,050
This is also the quote of my teacher, Detective Di.

185
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:54,260
I'm afraid that

186
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:55,610
we haven't found out

187
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:57,170
the truth of

188
00:11:57,190 --> 00:11:58,470
the Chang'an black tea case.

189
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:00,540
If that Gentleman Shiyi is still alive,

190
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:01,960
he might be able to...

191
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:05,940
How unfortunate!

192
00:12:06,530 --> 00:12:07,200
Gentleman Shiyi?

193
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:09,060
What did he tell you?

194
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:12,920
If I can make a career

195
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:13,880
with Chang'an black tea,

196
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,070
he'll report to the Emperor

197
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,080
to make me the King of the Ghost Market.

198
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:22,630
You can neither believe all the words of an enchanter,

199
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:24,550
nor deny all his words,

200
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:26,640
but you don't need to know.

201
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:28,330
If you think

202
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:30,230
I got this position of the Military Commander of Nanzhou

203
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:32,500
because I framed you,

204
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:34,740
you can kill me immediately.

205
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:36,660
If not,

206
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:39,020
you can follow me

207
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:40,560
to Nanzhou.

208
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:42,720
What do you mean?

209
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:45,820
Otherwise,

210
00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:48,240
you'll have to pack up all your things

211
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:49,890
and go back to your hometown.

212
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:51,300
But the problem is

213
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:53,450
you're from a noble family.

214
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:54,880
If you go back like this,

215
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:57,990
your clansmen will laugh at you.

216
00:12:58,380 --> 00:12:58,950
Su Wuming!

217
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:00,560
Why are you doing this again?

218
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:01,800
Stop your sweet talk,

219
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:03,380
I know you're just afraid of death.

220
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:09,710
It's my business whether I'm afraid of death,

221
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:11,180
it's none of your business.

222
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:11,980
I just think that

223
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:13,680
you are still clueless about

224
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:14,960
what you are doing until now.

225
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:20,720
You can stab me to death,

226
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,390
but what will happen next?

227
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:25,540
There will be more truth-covering fog

228
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:26,490
surrounding you,

229
00:13:26,510 --> 00:13:27,300
and there will be people

230
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:28,840
who don't know the truth think that

231
00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:30,110
you killed me

232
00:13:30,290 --> 00:13:31,980
for some plot.

233
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:33,060
If so,

234
00:13:33,850 --> 00:13:37,020
you'll never be able to clear up your suspicion.

235
00:13:54,110 --> 00:13:55,070
I may not kill you,

236
00:13:57,940 --> 00:13:59,220
but I won't go with you.

237
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:04,000
Are you really going to

238
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:05,630
wandering around aimlessly?

239
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:06,390
My arms are sore.

240
00:14:06,850 --> 00:14:09,520
Do you think it is so easy to survive out there?

241
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:12,580
You need money for food, right?

242
00:14:13,190 --> 00:14:14,820
You need money for shelter, right?

243
00:14:14,890 --> 00:14:17,210
You'll need money for winter clothing as well.

244
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:19,880
How many days do your think

245
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:21,060
you can survive with your money now?

246
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:22,820
What will you do if you run out of money?

247
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:24,660
Robbing?

248
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:28,470
You need to earn money to support yourself.

249
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:29,190
I, Lu Lingfeng.

250
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:29,660
Also,

251
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:31,490
you've promised Fed

252
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:33,380
to give him a chicken every day,

253
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,720
but you want to leave just like this.

254
00:14:35,970 --> 00:14:37,130
That's wrong.

255
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:39,250
You must keep your word,

256
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:40,220
my General.

257
00:14:41,090 --> 00:14:42,330
He is right, Lu Lingfeng.

258
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:43,540
You have to keep your word.

259
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:44,640
One chicken a day,

260
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:45,580
that's what you said.

261
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:49,790
What happened to me

262
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:52,420
has nothing to do with you?

263
00:14:58,300 --> 00:14:59,290
What do you think?

264
00:15:01,830 --> 00:15:03,190
Since you were

265
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:04,590
the General of the Imperial Guards,

266
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:06,610
I won't treat you unfairly if you follow me to Nanzhou.

267
00:15:07,290 --> 00:15:08,600
How about

268
00:15:09,170 --> 00:15:10,600
becoming my personal staff?

269
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:12,520
Your personal staff?

270
00:15:15,450 --> 00:15:16,580
Don't just stand there,

271
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,620
help me to carry the books.

272
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:21,820
You will not become my personal staff

273
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:22,420
for nothing.

274
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:23,870
I'll pay you

275
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:25,100
from my salary.

276
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:26,630
How much will be the exact amount of your pay?

277
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:27,950
Let's discuss it on our way.

278
00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:32,870
I've forgotten that

279
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:34,990
you're injured.

280
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:35,690
How about this?

281
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:38,360
I'll carry it for you now,

282
00:15:39,070 --> 00:15:40,740
you can carry it when you recover.

283
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:48,780
It's nothing carrying these books.

284
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:55,090
My injuries

285
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:57,020
don't matter.

286
00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:02,180
I would like to thank you

287
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:03,990
for not leaving

288
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:07,010
and being willing to follow me to the south.

289
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:11,510
From now on,

290
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:12,910
there is no

291
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:14,180
General Lu Lingfeng anymore.

292
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:15,700
From now on,

293
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:17,890
you can call me Minister Lu.

294
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:19,790
It's up to you.

295
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:23,320
Well...

296
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:25,180
this is a deal?

297
00:16:26,430 --> 00:16:27,570
You haven't talked about the pay with him, have you?

298
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:29,350
How much will he pay you a month?

299
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:31,180
Is it enough to buy me chicken?

300
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,650
Both of you,

301
00:17:12,150 --> 00:17:14,680
are you really going to walk to Nanzhou?

302
00:17:14,859 --> 00:17:16,109
No horse riding.

303
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:17,390
No car allowed.

304
00:17:17,859 --> 00:17:19,329
How can we go without walking?

305
00:17:19,690 --> 00:17:21,160
But if we go on like this,

306
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:23,119
our legs will be broken

307
00:17:23,530 --> 00:17:25,530
before we reach Nanzhou.

308
00:17:25,910 --> 00:17:27,460
Why are you so naggy?

309
00:17:27,950 --> 00:17:28,620
You are repeating the same thing

310
00:17:29,030 --> 00:17:29,720
three to four times

311
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:30,610
every day.

312
00:17:31,290 --> 00:17:32,680
You think I'm naggy?

313
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:35,100
I haven't eaten chicken for three days!

314
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:37,610
To be accurate,  it is two and a half days.

315
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,400
There was no chicken at all

316
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:40,840
at the stage station on the first day.

317
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:42,120
Yesterday,

318
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:43,880
the shop was sold out of chicken.

319
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:45,670
It depends on your luck

320
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:47,640
whether you get to eat a chicken.

321
00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:03,580
Good punching skill!

322
00:18:07,390 --> 00:18:07,990
Miss,

323
00:18:08,930 --> 00:18:09,810
It's late now,

324
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:11,240
why are you still awake?

325
00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:12,850
I can't sleep.

326
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:14,280
Come and talk to me.

327
00:18:14,410 --> 00:18:14,870
Sure.

328
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:16,860
Miss,

329
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:19,050
well,

330
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:21,020
I don't know what to talk about.

331
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:23,890
Let's talk about you.

332
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:25,890
I remember when you were nine,

333
00:18:26,210 --> 00:18:27,350
it was me who asked my servant

334
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:28,370
to buy you back.

335
00:18:28,610 --> 00:18:29,100
Yes, you are right!

336
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:30,220
Miss,

337
00:18:30,930 --> 00:18:31,980
there were so many people there,

338
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:33,410
why did you choose me?

339
00:18:33,890 --> 00:18:34,820
I can draw,

340
00:18:35,130 --> 00:18:35,820
you know that, right?

341
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:36,890
Of course.

342
00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:38,320
Everyone in this building

343
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:39,480
knows that.

344
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:40,990
Your drawing skill is so amazing that

345
00:18:41,150 --> 00:18:42,060
all of your paintings

346
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:43,930
were lifelike.

347
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:45,620
If you want to learn painting,

348
00:18:45,850 --> 00:18:47,040
you have to learn to read one's face.

349
00:18:47,670 --> 00:18:48,680
When I saw you that day,

350
00:18:48,930 --> 00:18:50,740
I knew you were not an ordinary person.

351
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:53,260
I've sold myself as a slave,

352
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:55,660
what's there to be extraordinary about?

353
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:57,590
But when my mother was still alive, she

354
00:18:57,620 --> 00:18:58,610
once said that

355
00:18:58,890 --> 00:18:59,700
my ancestors

356
00:18:59,730 --> 00:19:00,690
were amazing.

357
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:02,400
There's even a general among my ancestors.

358
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:03,700
Xue Huan,

359
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:05,500
could it be that you are the descendant of Xue Rengui?

360
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:07,300
Who is X-Xue Renhui?

361
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:09,660
You don’t even know

362
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:10,420
your ancestors.

363
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:13,900
Why do you always sigh

364
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:15,540
at such a young age?

365
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,000
Xue Huan,

366
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:19,510
let me ask you.

367
00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:21,480
Do you want to be like your ancestors,

368
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:23,420
becoming a general

369
00:19:23,450 --> 00:19:24,280
on the battlefield?

370
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:26,270
Of course I want to.

371
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:28,290
But,

372
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:29,910
I'm just a small servant

373
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:31,100
in your family.

374
00:19:31,810 --> 00:19:32,970
You are a servant, so what?

375
00:19:33,370 --> 00:19:34,940
You'll regain the glory of your ancestors sooner or later.

376
00:19:36,170 --> 00:19:37,490
But,

377
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,470
you must be brave.

378
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:40,660
Brave?

379
00:19:43,410 --> 00:19:44,430
How can I do to be considered brave?

380
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:46,090
Anyone who achieved great things

381
00:19:46,290 --> 00:19:47,450
dare to take risks.

382
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:49,610
For example,

383
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:52,570
do you dare to run away from

384
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:53,380
Chang'an with me?

385
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:54,510
My Lady, you.

386
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:55,270
Forget it if you don't dare.

387
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:56,420
You can

388
00:19:56,450 --> 00:19:57,350
tell my father

389
00:19:58,100 --> 00:19:58,820
and ask him for a reward too.

390
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:10,510
[Yuelai Inn]

391
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:14,260
Waiter,

392
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:17,810
Have you seen

393
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:19,370
the old man with us?

394
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:20,140
Which old man?

395
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:22,150
He is looks unkempt

396
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:23,590
just like a beggar,

397
00:20:24,050 --> 00:20:24,980
with a gourd at his waist.

398
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:26,660
Ouh, him!

399
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:28,770
You mean Chicken Fed?

400
00:20:32,410 --> 00:20:33,720
How do you know his name?

401
00:20:34,010 --> 00:20:35,180
Mr. Fed told me.

402
00:20:36,010 --> 00:20:36,700
Mr. Fed?

403
00:20:37,130 --> 00:20:37,530
Yes.

404
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:39,800
Mr. Fed got up early in the morning.

405
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:41,530
He asked me to buy him

406
00:20:41,570 --> 00:20:42,570
a horse in the market,

407
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:44,210
and wanted to leave earlier.

408
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:47,420
By the way,

409
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:48,930
he has left a letter.

410
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:50,690
It's on my cabinet.

411
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:51,540
Let's go.

412
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:54,410
Have you found Fed?

413
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:55,660
He has left.

414
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:57,700
He even bought a horse.

415
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,910
I didn't know he's that rich.

416
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:01,450
He's rich.

417
00:21:02,190 --> 00:21:03,550
Touch the money bag with you,

418
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:04,250
is it still there?

419
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:08,740
That bastard!

420
00:21:09,230 --> 00:21:10,450
This is a letter from Fed.

421
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:11,970
What Mr. Fed,

422
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:13,720
he's just a thief.

423
00:21:17,930 --> 00:21:18,620
Lu Lingfeng,

424
00:21:19,410 --> 00:21:21,170
I'm old.

425
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:23,000
I really can't stand

426
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:24,690
the tiring daily walking journey anymore.

427
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:26,790
I've brought some money with me.

428
00:21:27,230 --> 00:21:28,350
I think it's enough

429
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:29,420
for months of chicken.

430
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:32,250
If I've spent all the money and still alive,

431
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,720
I'll come back and ask it from you.

432
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,520
Farewell.

433
00:21:37,090 --> 00:21:37,970
If it's fate,

434
00:21:38,450 --> 00:21:40,010
see you again.

435
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,500
That bastard.

436
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:44,930
Did he think that leaving this note

437
00:21:45,230 --> 00:21:46,320
will justify his stealing?

438
00:21:47,690 --> 00:21:48,210
That's enough.

439
00:21:48,810 --> 00:21:49,960
Pack your things,

440
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:51,780
It's time to go.

441
00:22:32,210 --> 00:22:33,070
That's not right.

442
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:35,320
This stage station

443
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:38,010
isn't on the posthouse map.

444
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:40,580
Maybe it's a private station.

445
00:22:41,090 --> 00:22:41,730
It will be raining heavily soon,

446
00:22:42,010 --> 00:22:42,740
it's okay to stay here for now.

447
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:50,850
Is anyone there?

448
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:52,180
Open the door!

449
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:00,930
Who are you?

450
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:12,890
It's you who knock at my door,

451
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:14,930
and you ask me who I am?

452
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:16,890
We are heading south to take office.

453
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:18,940
It will be raining heavily soon,

454
00:23:18,970 --> 00:23:20,850
we want to stay here for a night.

455
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:23,420
No one can stay here.

456
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:25,690
You...

457
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:31,470
According to the markings on the map,

458
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:33,430
the next stage station

459
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:34,600
is ten miles away.

460
00:23:34,930 --> 00:23:36,190
This plaque clearly says

461
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:37,020
Gantang Post.

462
00:23:37,370 --> 00:23:38,600
It must be an official post.

463
00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:40,290
Judging from his clothes,

464
00:23:40,610 --> 00:23:41,770
he's obviously a corvee working in the post.

465
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:43,690
Why would he

466
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:45,140
refuse our request?

467
00:23:50,970 --> 00:23:53,280
I heard what you said.

468
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:56,260
It used to be an official post,

469
00:23:56,770 --> 00:23:59,130
but it has been abandoned now.

470
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:02,210
The new stage station is ten miles away,

471
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:05,590
you may stay over there.

472
00:24:08,790 --> 00:24:10,230
The heavy rain is coming soon.

473
00:24:10,350 --> 00:24:11,080
You don't allow us to stay

474
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:11,960
instead, you insist on sending us away?

475
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:13,080
I told you,

476
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:14,590
this post had been abandoned.

477
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:15,860
Since this post has been abandoned,

478
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:17,310
why are you

479
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:18,420
still staying at here?

480
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:23,470
Eight years ago,

481
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:26,300
I came to Gantang Post as a corvee.

482
00:24:26,990 --> 00:24:29,350
This place was abandoned three years ago.

483
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:31,100
I had nowhere to go,

484
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:33,300
so I took it as my home,

485
00:24:35,170 --> 00:24:36,650
couldn't I?

486
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:38,940
Since you were a corvee working in post,

487
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:40,300
you should let the court officials in

488
00:24:40,690 --> 00:24:42,290
on a rainy night like this.

489
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:44,020
Whether this post is abandoned or not,

490
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:45,380
it is owned by the government.

491
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:47,110
If you keep declining us,

492
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:48,790
I'll flog you.

493
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:57,090
Since you insist on staying,

494
00:24:57,380 --> 00:24:58,770
I have to

495
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:00,710
make things clear first.

496
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:03,240
This stage station

497
00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:05,630
is haunted.

498
00:25:09,770 --> 00:25:10,390
Stop talking nonsense.

499
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:11,040
Get out of the way.

500
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:43,180
What are you waiting for?

501
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:44,060
Open the door.

502
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:49,300
Ever since this stage station was abandoned,

503
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:51,910
I have been living in the wing-room.

504
00:25:52,330 --> 00:25:53,530
The door of the hall

505
00:25:54,290 --> 00:25:57,010
has been locked for years.

506
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:22,310
I really can't tell

507
00:26:22,430 --> 00:26:25,410
who is the soldier and who is the official.

508
00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:29,350
Since this stage station

509
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:30,700
has been abandoned,

510
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:32,780
should we pay

511
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:34,250
if we want to stay here?

512
00:26:34,810 --> 00:26:36,500
Are these enough?

513
00:26:39,570 --> 00:26:40,720
I see.

514
00:26:41,030 --> 00:26:42,990
You are the master, and he is the servant.

515
00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:45,650
May I know your name?

516
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:47,970
I'm the new Military Commander of Nanzhou,

517
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:48,700
Su Wuming.

518
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:49,780
How about him?

519
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:52,580
This is my personal staff.

520
00:26:52,610 --> 00:26:53,960
So your official title

521
00:26:53,990 --> 00:26:56,180
is given by yourself,

522
00:26:57,500 --> 00:27:00,280
and you even wanted to flog me.

523
00:27:01,190 --> 00:27:03,050
How dare you?

524
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:05,990
After all, I've been a corvee working in post

525
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:07,100
for years.

526
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:08,980
I know the rules.

527
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:11,880
Your personal staff who gave himself an official title is right.

528
00:27:13,270 --> 00:27:15,620
This is indeed the government's place.

529
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:17,380
So I won't

530
00:27:17,850 --> 00:27:18,970
take the money.

531
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:21,330
I don't want anyone to sue me

532
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:24,030
and make me guilty.

533
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:25,700
Since you refused to get paid,

534
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:26,290
then

535
00:27:26,610 --> 00:27:28,350
at least let us fill our stomach.

536
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:30,740
Although this stage station is closed,

537
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,550
I still have some food and vegetables.

538
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:35,610
Please wait a moment.

539
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:37,280
I'll cook for you now.

540
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:38,620
Thank you.

541
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:40,720
By the way,

542
00:27:42,250 --> 00:27:43,880
what happened to your finger?

543
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:48,890
It got bitten off by a wild dog.

544
00:27:51,990 --> 00:27:53,590
How ridiculous!

545
00:27:56,740 --> 00:27:57,820
In my opinion,

546
00:27:58,100 --> 00:28:00,110
he's right to pick your fault.

547
00:28:00,350 --> 00:28:02,260
I, the Military Commander, haven't even sat down yet,

548
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:03,710
you have sat there first.

549
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:04,740
Is this appropriate?

550
00:28:06,130 --> 00:28:07,120
But Liu Shiba

551
00:28:07,150 --> 00:28:08,240
is quite strange.

552
00:28:08,530 --> 00:28:09,610
He doesn't look like

553
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:11,560
a corvee working in post.

554
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:43,070
Who?

555
00:28:53,430 --> 00:28:57,230
[Abundance of blessings come at the same time]

556
00:29:16,590 --> 00:29:18,680
I don't know if it suits your taste.

557
00:29:24,750 --> 00:29:25,300
Liu Shiba,

558
00:29:26,650 --> 00:29:28,050
is there anyone else in this stage station

559
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:29,890
besides you?

560
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:35,170
I'm the only one living in this stage station.

561
00:29:35,420 --> 00:29:37,540
Who else lives here?

562
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:38,940
Impossible.

563
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,120
I saw someone

564
00:29:42,690 --> 00:29:44,790
outside just now.

565
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:47,010
I think you are too hungry.

566
00:29:47,190 --> 00:29:48,270
If you don't eat now,

567
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:50,060
you may even see ghosts.

568
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:51,530
Liu Shiba,

569
00:29:52,210 --> 00:29:53,970
don't you want to eat together?

570
00:29:54,430 --> 00:29:55,840
I've eaten.

571
00:29:56,510 --> 00:29:58,460
I'm going to feed the chicken now.

572
00:29:58,780 --> 00:29:59,180
Wait.

573
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:04,560
Since there's chicken,

574
00:30:05,530 --> 00:30:06,810
why don't you kill one for us to eat?

575
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:07,980
Chicken,

576
00:30:08,250 --> 00:30:09,820
is for laying eggs.

577
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:13,020
But I can't see

578
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:14,880
any egg in this vegetable ball.

579
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:16,930
What? Are you unhappy with it?

580
00:30:17,510 --> 00:30:19,470
You can choose not to eat.

581
00:30:19,690 --> 00:30:20,180
Liu Shiba!

582
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:20,970
Look,

583
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:24,460
isn't Commander Su enjoying the food?

584
00:30:25,910 --> 00:30:26,710
Yes, it is delicious.

585
00:30:26,750 --> 00:30:28,190
After dinner,

586
00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:30,030
you may rest in the first room

587
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:30,920
at the right wing

588
00:30:31,180 --> 00:30:32,420
That room is big.

589
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:34,360
Last month, there's even a wandering monk

590
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:35,350
stayed here,

591
00:30:35,650 --> 00:30:37,100
it has more signs of life there.

592
00:30:37,290 --> 00:30:38,280
Don't you have superior rooms

593
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:39,800
in your stage station?

594
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:43,130
There are two superior rooms in the stage station.

595
00:30:43,730 --> 00:30:44,730
So?

596
00:30:44,810 --> 00:30:45,650
So?

597
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:47,380
Since there are superior rooms,

598
00:30:47,530 --> 00:30:48,500
why don't you let us live there?

599
00:30:48,990 --> 00:30:49,610
What do you mean?

600
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:51,220
The right superior room

601
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:54,100
is the reason

602
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:55,610
why I just said the stage station was haunted.

603
00:30:57,100 --> 00:30:59,400
Does Commander Su dare to stay there?

604
00:31:02,730 --> 00:31:03,580
In that case,

605
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:04,470
isn't there a left superior room

606
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:05,100
available?

607
00:31:05,130 --> 00:31:07,140
You can't stay in the left superior room either.

608
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:09,250
According to the rules of Tang's stage station,

609
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:11,940
the superior rooms are only for officials

610
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:13,110
above the fifth-rank.

611
00:31:13,490 --> 00:31:15,020
If I remember correctly,

612
00:31:15,210 --> 00:31:16,850
Nanzhou belongs to the downtown,

613
00:31:17,410 --> 00:31:19,200
so Military Commander is not qualified enough.

614
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:20,500
Of course,

615
00:31:20,530 --> 00:31:22,860
If you are the serving officials

616
00:31:23,210 --> 00:31:25,120
surnamed Cui, Lu, Li or Zheng,

617
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:26,880
then you can stay there.

618
00:31:27,050 --> 00:31:28,480
This stage station has been abandoned,

619
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:30,050
how can you still be so gabby?

620
00:31:30,810 --> 00:31:31,280
However,

621
00:31:31,630 --> 00:31:32,990
since you know the rules of Tang,

622
00:31:33,330 --> 00:31:34,710
then hurry up and

623
00:31:34,750 --> 00:31:35,470
clean up the left superior room.

624
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:38,560
I am Lu Lingfeng

625
00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:39,640
from the Lu family of Fanyang.

626
00:31:40,950 --> 00:31:41,680
Can I stay there?

627
00:31:44,210 --> 00:31:46,540
Are you from the Lu family of Fanyang?

628
00:31:47,850 --> 00:31:48,290
What?

629
00:31:48,870 --> 00:31:49,600
Don't I look like one of the Lu family?

630
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:51,960
No wonder.

631
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:55,240
But you are Commander Su's guard,

632
00:31:55,410 --> 00:31:57,260
not a serving official.

633
00:31:57,540 --> 00:31:58,910
Even if your surname is Lu,

634
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:00,450
you can't stay there.

635
00:32:01,130 --> 00:32:01,460
You...

636
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:03,060
I...

637
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:04,790
I think you did it on purpose.

638
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:06,990
Enough. Enough.

639
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:08,100
Stop arguing.

640
00:32:08,490 --> 00:32:09,850
Wing-room is fine.

641
00:32:09,870 --> 00:32:10,550
What's the big deal?

642
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:13,690
Didn't you hear that the room was big?

643
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:17,290
Commander Su is reasonable.

644
00:32:23,130 --> 00:32:24,020
Remember,

645
00:32:24,620 --> 00:32:26,980
you can't stay in any of the other rooms

646
00:32:27,150 --> 00:32:29,230
except for the first room at the right wing.

647
00:32:40,230 --> 00:32:41,670
He is just a corvee working in post,

648
00:32:42,170 --> 00:32:43,960
how dare he act like a snob!

649
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:46,950
Taste the vegetable ball.

650
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:47,930
It's really good.

651
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:49,860
What is it?

652
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:51,190
How can you swallow it?

653
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:55,090
I'm not you.

654
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:56,930
You were wellborn and had a wealthy life.

655
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:59,320
I ate this a lot when I was young.

656
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:03,700
Aren't you hungry after carrying the bookcase all day?

657
00:33:06,590 --> 00:33:07,350
No matter how hungry I am,

658
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:09,710
I won't eat

659
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:10,660
the food made by Liu Shiba.

660
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:16,790
A renowned scholar should be open-minded and unrestrained.

661
00:33:16,810 --> 00:33:18,340
Just like Ruan Ji,

662
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:20,260
he can act as there was no one else

663
00:33:20,290 --> 00:33:21,530
in front of Sima Zhao,

664
00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:24,370
and he can also be drunk under the feet of a beautiful woman

665
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:25,710
without any other thoughts.

666
00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:28,840
A corvee working in post is not respectful enough to you,

667
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,220
why are you so angry about it?

668
00:33:32,630 --> 00:33:33,690
I've become

669
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:34,920
your personal staff.

670
00:33:36,940 --> 00:33:38,280
What kind of renowned scholar I am?

671
00:34:06,790 --> 00:34:08,480
The rear windows are sealed,

672
00:34:08,659 --> 00:34:09,770
I'm relieved.

673
00:34:11,610 --> 00:34:13,400
Although you've solved many cases,

674
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:15,520
you are still a scholar.

675
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:17,639
You are really timid.

676
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:20,290
There's a ghost in this stage station,

677
00:34:20,310 --> 00:34:21,440
we'd better be careful.

678
00:34:22,230 --> 00:34:23,230
How could you believe

679
00:34:23,250 --> 00:34:24,889
Liu Shiba's nonsense?

680
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:26,800
Liu Shiba told us

681
00:34:26,830 --> 00:34:29,179
that the main hall had been locked for years.

682
00:34:29,489 --> 00:34:30,980
But when we were eating,

683
00:34:31,010 --> 00:34:33,090
I found the table was very clean.

684
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:34,530
There was no dust on it.

685
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:37,000
If it wasn't cleaned by people,

686
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:38,590
it must be

687
00:34:39,330 --> 00:34:40,170
a ghost.

688
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:46,230
I'm afraid you can't sleep with an empty stomach.

689
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:46,870
So I brought you

690
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:48,620
a vegetable ball.

691
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:49,489
Eat it.

692
00:34:55,330 --> 00:34:55,810
What?

693
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:58,910
Are you really going to starve for your pride?

694
00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:00,940
Get up and eat.

695
00:35:01,510 --> 00:35:02,090
I won't look at you

696
00:35:02,130 --> 00:35:03,910
so that you won't feel ashamed.

697
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:05,370
I'm not hungry at all.

698
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:06,500
But you are tossing and turning

699
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:08,100
and can't fall asleep.

700
00:35:08,530 --> 00:35:09,570
What are you doing?

701
00:35:14,330 --> 00:35:15,090
It's because

702
00:35:15,860 --> 00:35:17,020
I'm sleeping on the same bed

703
00:35:17,370 --> 00:35:18,980
with another man.

704
00:35:19,330 --> 00:35:20,290
That's why I can't fall asleep.

705
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:22,540
Liu Shiba!

706
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:23,890
In such a big stage station, he only provide us

707
00:35:24,450 --> 00:35:25,770
one room to stay in.

708
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:29,770
Just take it as his good intention.

709
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:32,620
What if

710
00:35:32,770 --> 00:35:33,940
ohter rooms are indeed haunted?

711
00:35:35,890 --> 00:35:36,300
Who?

712
00:35:41,090 --> 00:35:41,480
Stop!

713
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:45,990
Liu Shiba!

714
00:35:47,260 --> 00:35:48,460
How dare you come over to eavesdrop?

715
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,800
I didn't eavesdrop.

716
00:35:58,020 --> 00:35:58,980
I just thought

717
00:35:59,090 --> 00:36:01,540
that Commander must be tired all the way.

718
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:03,750
Would you like a bucket of hot water

719
00:36:03,860 --> 00:36:04,930
to soak your feet?

720
00:36:05,390 --> 00:36:06,460
Are you such a kind person?

721
00:36:07,180 --> 00:36:08,220
Then why didn't you take

722
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:09,510
a bucket of ready-made hot water to him?

723
00:36:10,950 --> 00:36:12,670
If Commander Su rests,

724
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:15,490
the hot water will be wasted.

725
00:36:15,790 --> 00:36:17,260
Do you think it is easy

726
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:18,610
to go up the mountain and chop firewood?

727
00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:21,210
Alright.

728
00:36:21,490 --> 00:36:22,850
Commander is asleep.

729
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:25,480
There's no need for hot water.

730
00:36:26,020 --> 00:36:27,620
Rest earlier.

731
00:36:43,490 --> 00:36:44,970
Who are you talking to outside?

732
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:47,210
Who else?

733
00:36:47,610 --> 00:36:48,420
Liu Shiba.

734
00:36:50,470 --> 00:36:51,530
I found him

735
00:36:51,550 --> 00:36:52,310
eavesdropping on us.

736
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:53,220
He acted obsequiously

737
00:36:53,510 --> 00:36:54,630
and talked himself out of trouble.

738
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:57,460
Don't be so fussy.

739
00:36:57,670 --> 00:36:58,750
Are you done?

740
00:36:59,090 --> 00:37:00,290
Go to bed now!

741
00:37:00,490 --> 00:37:01,890
We have to hurry on with our journey tomorrow.

742
00:37:07,780 --> 00:37:09,020
Other rooms are haunted?

743
00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:11,610
I don't believe it.

744

[Colonel of Zhechong Regiment, Colonel Yu]

745

[Gantang Post]

746
00:39:09,110 --> 00:39:10,810
Gantang Post?

747
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:12,320
Why is this place

748
00:39:12,730 --> 00:39:13,980
so shabby?

749
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:14,790
Let's not stay here.

750
00:39:15,230 --> 00:39:16,070
Let's go.

751
00:39:18,090 --> 00:39:18,870
Even if it's broken,

752
00:39:19,610 --> 00:39:21,040
but it's still a stage station,

753
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:22,940
I don't mind staying overnight.

754
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:24,480
No way.

755
00:39:24,750 --> 00:39:25,870
Please consider about your status,

756
00:39:26,180 --> 00:39:27,460
how can you stay in such a place?

757
00:39:28,620 --> 00:39:30,580
Although this stage station is old and shabby,

758
00:39:32,510 --> 00:39:33,920
but this person is new.

759
00:39:34,460 --> 00:39:35,590
I can't wait.

760
00:39:35,980 --> 00:39:36,250
Stay.

761
00:39:36,450 --> 00:39:37,730
Let's stay here.

762
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:43,260
Anybody?

763
00:39:45,050 --> 00:39:45,610
Anybody?

764
00:39:46,610 --> 00:39:47,450
Anybody? Quickly!

765
00:39:49,830 --> 00:39:50,770
Is anyone there?

766
00:39:51,090 --> 00:39:51,850
Anybody?

767
00:39:55,470 --> 00:39:56,430
Anybody?

768
00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:57,500
Open the door!

769
00:40:00,570 --> 00:40:01,970
Who is in charge here?

770
00:40:02,860 --> 00:40:04,320
There's only me here.

771
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:05,810
Then get the superior room ready,

772
00:40:06,230 --> 00:40:08,170
prepare some wine and food

773
00:40:09,170 --> 00:40:10,250
for Colonel Yu now.

774
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:13,540
Sir,

775
00:40:14,170 --> 00:40:15,560
this post has been deserted,

776
00:40:15,870 --> 00:40:17,270
no one can stay here anymore.

777
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:25,960
No matter how deserted it is, it's still a place to rest.

778
00:40:26,550 --> 00:40:27,690
I'm not that picky.

779
00:40:28,250 --> 00:40:28,930
We'll stay here!

780
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:30,110
Go away.

781
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:31,970
Sir.

782
00:40:32,410 --> 00:40:33,450
You really can't stay here.

783
00:40:33,470 --> 00:40:34,080
Hurry up. Hurry up.

784
00:40:34,450 --> 00:40:35,890
You'd better go somewhere else.

785
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:37,490
-Sir. -Put the carriage and horses here.

786
00:40:45,510 --> 00:40:45,990
Behave yourself.

787
00:40:51,490 --> 00:40:52,330
It seems that

788
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:53,250
no one else lives in this deserted post.

789
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:55,730
Go find her a room.

790
00:40:56,130 --> 00:40:56,620
Got it.

791
00:41:05,170 --> 00:41:05,610
Go inside.

792
00:41:11,270 --> 00:41:11,740
Colonel.

793
00:41:12,090 --> 00:41:13,730
I'll leave you to it.

794
00:41:14,510 --> 00:41:15,070
You may leave.

795
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:19,900
You didn't scream,

796
00:41:20,380 --> 00:41:21,860
how sensible you are.

797
00:41:23,070 --> 00:41:26,190
The deserted post has scene of romance.

798
00:41:26,740 --> 00:41:29,820
The moon shines on the beauty.

Although I'm a martial artist,

800
00:41:32,380 --> 00:41:35,520
my poem is not bad, right?
