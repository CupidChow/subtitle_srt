[Episode 18]

4
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:47,789
Until one day...

5
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:07,820
Excuse me,

6
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:10,440
does Juren Dugu live here?

7
00:02:11,009 --> 00:02:11,370
Yes,

8
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:13,240
and you are?

9
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:14,960
I'm his wife.

10
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:17,810
So you're Lady Dugu.

11
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:20,070
He is studying in the ancestral hall.

12
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,130
Please come in.

13
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:25,550
You are...

14
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,030
Ji Xiang?

15
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:29,900
He told me about you.

16
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:32,090
Thank you for taking care of him.

17
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:35,020
Here.

18
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:38,140
This is for you.

19
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:45,079
I didn't expect

20
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:47,600
Dugu had such a wife.

21
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:49,230
What confuses me more is

22
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:50,610
that since he has such a beautiful wife at home,

23
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:53,730
how could he be so determined

24
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:54,740
to study in the temple?

25
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:56,540
So you harbored some wicked ideas when you saw how beautiful she is.

26
00:02:58,130 --> 00:02:58,810
No.

27
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:02,000
I just have some desires occasionally

28
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:03,900
deep down in my heart.

29
00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:06,920
That kind of life,

30
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:08,990
when I killed someone for his property

31
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:10,940
and kidnapped beautiful women,

32
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:14,080
is too far from me.

33
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:19,740
It seems like a prelife.

34
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:24,980
Later,

35
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,820
there was another person moving in the temple.

36
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:30,730
-I'm sorry.  I'm sorry. -Stop! I'll kill you!

37
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:31,560
I'm sorry. Sorry!

38
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:32,150
Stop right there!

39
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:32,660
Father!

40
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:34,340
-You unfilial son! -Father, I am sorry!

41
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:35,770
I'll beat you up!

42
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,890
I, I've come to the temple.

43
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:39,130
Please, stop hitting me.

44
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:40,540
You think that's it?

45
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:42,090
You have to study hard

46
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:44,050
and study with your heart!

47
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,440
What are you...

48
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:47,480
Are you a cleaner in this temple?

49
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:48,480
Yes.

50
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:51,710
My son, Liu Youqiu, is here to study.

51
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:53,450
He will be studying here for at least three to five years,

52
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:55,079
or up to ten years.

53
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:55,730
No need.

54
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:57,700
I only need to stay here for a few months.

55
00:03:57,930 --> 00:03:59,170
Next spring, I promise

56
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:00,910
I will succeed in the imperial examination.

57
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:02,220
Bastard!

58
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,290
What are you talking about?

59
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:04,660
-Father! Father! -I'll kill you!

60
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:05,500
-I'm sorry. I'm sorry. -Stop!

61
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:06,230
I shouldn't say it, Father!

62
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:06,900
-Stop! You stop! -Guys.

63
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:08,220
No violence in the Confucian temple!

64
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:12,220
Brother,

65
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:13,630
you can't pass the exam

66
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:14,780
with only a few months' study.

67
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:15,740
Brother,

68
00:04:16,170 --> 00:04:17,160
are you also studying here?

69
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:18,670
Yes.

70
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:20,610
I've been here for two years.

71
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:22,680
What's your name?

72
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:24,780
I'm Dugu Xiashu.

73
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:26,440
I'm Liu Youqiu.

74
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:27,940
Greetings, brother.

75
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:28,970
That Liu Youqiu

76
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:29,960
is a playboy.

77
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:31,760
He often left the temple

78
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,030
and went out to look for women.

79
00:04:34,450 --> 00:04:36,070
But Dugu Xiashu didn't know.

80
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:40,570
Until one day...

81
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:43,250
Ji Xiang!

82
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:45,170
Ji Xiang!

83
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:48,820
Ji Xiang!

84
00:04:49,159 --> 00:04:50,659
What can I do for you?

85
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:53,220
Can you send me out?

86
00:04:54,409 --> 00:04:55,530
It's getting dark soon.

87
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:56,600
The road is desolate.

88
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:57,700
I am scared of going out alone.

89
00:04:57,940 --> 00:04:59,550
But I have already made an appointment with someone.

90
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:00,750
If I don't go,

91
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:02,510
I will let him down.

92
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:04,580
Well...

93
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:06,850
I beg you.

94
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:07,940
Juren,

95
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:09,550
I have to say this to you.

96
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:11,630
If you don't focus on your studies,

97
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:13,330
you can't pass the imperial exam.

98
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:14,920
What's the use of studying hard?

99
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:16,930
What's useful is my father's old friend.

100
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,310
To be honest,

101
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:20,060
Uncle Xu has replied

102
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:22,870
to make me become an imperial scholar next year.

103
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:26,650
Since then,

104
00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:28,510
I have no mood to study anymore.

105
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:31,230
Because no matter how hard I work,

106
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:33,600
I can't defeat

107
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:34,540
a scumbag like Liu Youqiu.

108
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:40,060
You are?

109
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:43,550
I'm Dugu's wife.

110
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:45,530
Ah, you're his wife.

111
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:48,030
Come with me to the Eastern Hall for some tea.

112
00:05:49,170 --> 00:05:50,159
This way, please.

113
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:53,390
Here.

114
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,940
Here. Take care.

115
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,400
It was Liu Youqiu who had some wicked idea to her.

116
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:00,470
One day when it rained,

117
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:03,480
Liu Youqiu guessed Qinghong would come,

118
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:05,710
so he sent Dugu Xiashu out

119
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:07,040
to buy candles.

120
00:06:09,850 --> 00:06:10,720
It smells so good.

121
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:15,490
What did you say?

122
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:16,220
I say...

123
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:19,070
you smell so good.

124
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:22,490
Lady,

125
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:24,580
let me hug you.

126
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:25,220
How dare you!

127
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:27,020
It's raining heavily outside.

128
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:28,960
Even if  I was timid before

129
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:30,240
I want to

130
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:32,960
be bold now.

131
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:34,390
Let go off me!

132
00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:37,090
All of this,

133
00:06:37,409 --> 00:06:39,580
Dugu said, he saw it with his own eyes too.

134
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:41,850
But the situation is slightly different.

135
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,050
How could he have seen it?

136
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:45,870
I told him everything.

137
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:47,140
He believes whatever you say?

138
00:06:47,730 --> 00:06:48,940
Besides the hidden weapon,

139
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,530
my master also taught me a unique skill,

140
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:54,950
which is using drug to manipulate other's minds.

141
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:00,860
The steel needle was poisoned.

142
00:07:01,090 --> 00:07:01,960
To Dugu,

143
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:04,320
You used drug.

144
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:08,420
No wonder Dugu was absent-minded,

145
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:10,540
had a bad sleep and went crazy in the end.

146
00:07:11,050 --> 00:07:12,170
He couldn't even tell

147
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:13,490
what he had been told,

148
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:14,760
what he had dreamed,

149
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,150
and what had actually happened.

150
00:07:17,590 --> 00:07:20,900
So it was caused by your ecstasy incense.

151
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:24,070
He enlightened you to study,

152
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:25,820
which is a favour to you.

153
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:27,850
Why are you doing this to him?

154
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:31,210
I have no choice.

155
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:35,050
I fall in love with Qinghong.

156
00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:37,170
Since the first time I saw her,

157
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:39,440
my silent heart

158
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:41,010
has been in a mess again.

159
00:07:42,130 --> 00:07:43,190
I just want her.

160
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:44,950
She is virtuous

161
00:07:46,409 --> 00:07:47,170
and beautiful.

162
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:50,960
If I came out first in the highest imperial examination one day,

163
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,150
only she

164
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:54,400
deserves to be my wife.

165
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:58,180
So I have to get her first.

166
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:00,620
Only in this way

167
00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:02,860
can she obey me

168
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:04,760
and accompany me to Chang'an for the exam.

169
00:08:05,130 --> 00:08:06,330
Then she and I can

170
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,160
start a perfect second half of my life.

171
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:10,250
So,

172
00:08:12,330 --> 00:08:13,260
I set a trap.

173
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:15,810
You used Liu Youqiu.

174
00:08:16,130 --> 00:08:18,950
I have to let Qinghong

175
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:19,750
be disappointed in Dugu Xiashu completely.

176
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:20,950
That's how I can swoop in.

177
00:08:21,730 --> 00:08:23,290
So you made it up

178
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:25,350
that they were in love.

179
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:27,460
And you deliberately let Qinghong know that.

180
00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:29,490
Yes.

181
00:08:30,890 --> 00:08:33,460
Liu Youqiu also coveted her.

182
00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:35,960
He actually believed

183
00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:37,750
that in this way,

184
00:08:37,970 --> 00:08:39,220
Qinghong would be disappointed in Dugu Xiashu,

185
00:08:40,130 --> 00:08:41,179
and came to him.

186
00:10:04,930 --> 00:10:05,830
I saw it all.

187
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:09,130
They were animals.

188
00:10:24,070 --> 00:10:27,340
I was so nice to her that day.

189
00:10:29,210 --> 00:10:30,180
Most importantly,

190
00:10:31,010 --> 00:10:32,200
when she was in despair,

191
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:35,090
I swooped in.

192
00:10:36,810 --> 00:10:37,530
Of course,

193
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:40,670
I also used a little ecstasy incense to her.

194
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:41,590
Anyway,

195
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:43,460
she made me strong in my faith.

196
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:44,730
I want to

197
00:10:45,210 --> 00:10:46,760
start my magnificent second half of my life

198
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:47,370
with her.

199
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:48,700
In that case,

200
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:51,000
why did you kill Qinghong?

201
00:10:59,570 --> 00:11:01,290
Because she saw

202
00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:04,570
I kill Liu Youqiu.

203
00:11:07,570 --> 00:11:10,370
I had been nagging

204
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:12,930
Dugu Xiashu

205
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:14,230
to let him believe

206
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:16,140
that Liu Youqiu was having an affair with his wife.

207
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,530
When Dugu Xiashu went home that day,

208
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:20,350
I knew he would threw her

209
00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:21,520
a writing of divorcement.

210
00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:24,820
I believed it was the time.

211
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:27,650
I would kill Liu Youqiu first,

212
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:30,430
steal the letter from the Liu's house,

213
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:32,840
and then flee with Qinghong.

214
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:37,840
But I didn't expect...

215
00:11:55,230 --> 00:11:56,650
My hand threw out the steel needle of its own accord.

216
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:58,340
I swear I didn't mean it.

217
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:00,360
I didn't even see who that was.

218
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:05,490
Qinghong!

219
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:07,080
Qinghong!

220
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:08,300
Qinghong!

221
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,190
Qinghong! How could it be you!

222
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,170
Qinghong!

223
00:12:15,450 --> 00:12:17,180
Although she was dead,

224
00:12:17,210 --> 00:12:19,590
your plan was not stopped.

225
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:22,140
Of course.

226
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:24,770
With my talent,

227
00:12:25,530 --> 00:12:27,170
together with that letter,

228
00:12:27,370 --> 00:12:29,030
how can I not become an imperial scholar?

229
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:32,640
Dugu Xiashu had long lost his mind.

230
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:34,040
And he suspected

231
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:35,870
that Liu Youqiu was having an affair with his wife.

232
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:37,870
To be considered as the murderer

233
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:40,020
is very reasonable.

234
00:12:40,690 --> 00:12:41,650
I didn't

235
00:12:41,850 --> 00:12:43,800
suspect Dugu Xiashu at the first place.

236
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:45,740
But his neighbour,

237
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:48,190
that old man, has a problem with his ears.

238
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,840
He made us take many detours.

239
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:52,650
Did you see him kill someone?

240
00:12:54,090 --> 00:12:54,700
No.

241
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:57,690
But I heard

242
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:00,190
he sharpen a knife in the middle of the night.

243
00:13:01,050 --> 00:13:03,150
Though it was raining that night,

244
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:06,340
and my hearing was bad,

245
00:13:06,810 --> 00:13:08,180
I still

246
00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:10,660
clearly heard

247
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:12,140
he was sharpening his knife.

248
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:15,350
To clear my doubts,

249
00:13:15,690 --> 00:13:17,380
I went to

250
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:18,790
Dugu Xiashu's house again yesterday.

251
00:13:18,810 --> 00:13:20,730
[Dugu's Residence]

252
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:27,450
Your Honor,

253
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:28,860
you're here again.

254
00:13:29,930 --> 00:13:31,610
Was there

255
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:34,710
a wife

256
00:13:35,170 --> 00:13:37,450
killed by her husband again?

257
00:13:37,930 --> 00:13:40,070
Why did you say that?

258
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:42,310
Last night,

259
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:43,620
and the night before yesterday,

260
00:13:44,010 --> 00:13:45,660
I heard someone

261
00:13:46,210 --> 00:13:48,370
sharpening the knife two nights in a row.

262
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:50,630
That noise

263
00:13:51,490 --> 00:13:53,320
was so frightening.

264
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:57,380
So

265
00:13:57,380 --> 00:13:58,550
you couldn't have caught me.

266
00:14:00,370 --> 00:14:01,480
It was all because of my bad luck.

267
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:02,900
The treasure I hid in the temple

268
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:04,230
was found by Dong Lang,

269
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,200
so that I didn't have the money to go to Chang'an.

270
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:08,440
I had to go to Dugu's residence to get money.

271
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:11,670
The Dugu family has ancestral silver ingots

272
00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:14,650
which are buried under the rice jar.

273
00:14:15,010 --> 00:14:15,810
Did

274
00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:17,280
Qinghong tell you that day?

275
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:18,590
Yes.

276
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:22,260
She loved me so much.

277
00:14:22,590 --> 00:14:24,220
Otherwise,

278
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:25,710
how would she tell me about the seven silver ingots?

279
00:14:26,650 --> 00:14:27,270
But I

280
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,830
killed her accidentally.

281
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:32,090
Don't flatter yourself.

282
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:33,820
If you didn't use that  incense,

283
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:35,660
Qinghong wouldn't have been with you.

284
00:14:37,070 --> 00:14:37,850
Let me tell you.

285
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,230
Qinghong regretted it long ago.

286
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:41,200
She had already dug

287
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:42,140
the six silver ingots out

288
00:14:42,270 --> 00:14:43,140
and burried them in another place.

289
00:14:43,410 --> 00:14:44,940
Even if you didn't meet me that night,

290
00:14:45,730 --> 00:14:47,110
you wouldn't have

291
00:14:47,130 --> 00:14:48,210
got these ingots of Dugu family.

292
00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:54,690
And Dugu didn't divorce Qinghong.

293
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:57,370
They were back together.

294
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,690
I believe the reason why Qinghong went to the temple late at night

295
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:17,780
was to make it clear to you

296
00:15:17,810 --> 00:15:19,700
that you shouldn't see each other again

297
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:21,750
and cut off everything

298
00:15:21,770 --> 00:15:23,210
that shouldn't have happened.

299
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:26,030
But who knows she would see you commit the crime

300
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:28,610
and was murdered.

301
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:32,690
Impossible!

302
00:15:34,770 --> 00:15:36,100
Dugu Xiashu is a nerd.

303
00:15:36,690 --> 00:15:37,530
It's impossible that Qinghong

304
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:38,700
be loyal to him.

305
00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:40,720
She must have come to me to elope with me.

306
00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:42,550
She only has me in her heart.

307
00:15:43,190 --> 00:15:44,360
And I only have her in my heart.

308
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:45,690
Don't try to fool me.

309
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:49,680
Impossible.

310
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:51,320
You don't deserve to be a human!

311
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,750
You keep saying that you have Qinghong in your heart.

312
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:55,550
But in order to make Dugu Xiashu

313
00:15:55,570 --> 00:15:56,290
take the blame for you,

314
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:58,450
you actually slashed several times

315
00:15:58,580 --> 00:15:59,650
on her neck.

316
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:02,560
You are really vicious.

317
00:16:03,930 --> 00:16:04,870
Fortunately,

318
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:10,180
justice has long arms.

319
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:19,540
Go and prepare for the exam in Chang'an.

320
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:21,610
You've studied hard for many years.

321
00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:24,420
Confucius and the ancestors of the Dugu family

322
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:25,570
will bless you.

323
00:16:25,770 --> 00:16:27,090
You must can pass the imperial exam next year.

324
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:29,770
I want to go to Chang'an with you.

325
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:33,250
We will never be apart.

326
00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:52,140
Minister Lu.

327
00:16:53,090 --> 00:16:53,770
Why are you in such a hurry?

328
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:54,700
Do you have any money?

329
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:56,580
Yes.

330
00:16:57,630 --> 00:16:58,470
My ancestral silver ingots

331
00:16:58,620 --> 00:16:59,790
was stolen by thieves.

332
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:00,960
Luckily there's one ingot left.

333
00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:08,599
The six silver ingots

334
00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:10,220
were not stolen by thieves.

335
00:17:10,670 --> 00:17:12,700
It was Qinghong who moved them to under the bed.

336
00:17:13,619 --> 00:17:14,940
Fortunately, Commander Su found them out.

337
00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:16,180
He asked me to return it to you.

338
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:21,050
Fed said

339
00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:22,369
you've recovered.

340
00:17:23,099 --> 00:17:24,810
You must avoid thinking wild in the future.

341
00:17:26,869 --> 00:17:27,640
Thank you, Minister Lu.

342
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:30,750
Please thank Physician Fed,

343
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,080
Commander Su,

344
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:33,950
and Miss Xijun, who helped me draw

345
00:17:34,610 --> 00:17:35,910
and cleared my name, for me.

346
00:17:38,170 --> 00:17:39,200
Speaking of Miss Xijun,

347
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:43,540
she asked you to give this letter

348
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:45,060
to the Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Personnel Administration, Pei Jian.

349
00:17:46,410 --> 00:17:47,120
Deputy Minister?

350
00:17:48,130 --> 00:17:48,890
How can I get to see

351
00:17:49,090 --> 00:17:49,950
such a high-ranking official?

352
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:56,560
You take this letter

353
00:17:56,990 --> 00:17:57,820
to the right Imperial Guards

354
00:17:57,860 --> 00:17:58,920
to find someone named Guo Zhuang.

355
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:00,330
He will arrange it for you.

356
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,250
Miss Xijun

357
00:18:04,730 --> 00:18:05,940
is Assistant Minister Pei's daughter.

358
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,130
This time,

359
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,750
she sneaked out of Chang'an.

360
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:10,570
Bring this letter to him

361
00:18:10,610 --> 00:18:11,210
and tell him she is safe.

362
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:13,060
Assistant Minister Pei will be grateful to you.

363
00:18:13,910 --> 00:18:14,640
Later in Chang'an,

364
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,230
you can have an acquaintance.

365
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:19,420
Minister Lu,

366
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,110
didn't you always

367
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:22,900
look down on me?

368
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:24,520
Why are you helping me now?

369
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:28,880
It's because

370
00:18:28,910 --> 00:18:29,760
I was wrong about you.

371
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:32,590
If it is

372
00:18:33,010 --> 00:18:34,100
helpful

373
00:18:34,130 --> 00:18:35,100
to your career,

374
00:18:36,530 --> 00:18:37,580
I will feel relieved.

375
00:18:41,630 --> 00:18:42,510
Do you know how to ride a horse?

376
00:18:43,570 --> 00:18:44,050
Of course.

377
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:45,650
My ancestors came from the north.

378
00:18:46,270 --> 00:18:47,310
How can I not ride horses?

379
00:18:47,950 --> 00:18:48,410
Good.

380
00:18:50,570 --> 00:18:51,400
Then this horse

381
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:52,820
is yours!

382
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:55,500
Then...

383
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:57,340
Does it mean that you have to walk back to the city?

384
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:58,880
I can enjoy

385
00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:00,390
the beautiful scenery in Nanzhou on the way.

386
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:23,140
The deities on the bridge,

387
00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:25,270
Xue Huan is here!

388
00:19:53,090 --> 00:19:53,980
Thank you, General.

389
00:19:58,010 --> 00:19:59,160
What are you doing?

390
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:01,420
In this murder case in the Confucian temple,

391
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:03,170
I've repeatedly jumped to the conclusion

392
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:06,610
that Dugu Xiashu is the murderer.

393
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:08,110
If it weren't for you,

394
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,060
I would have made a huge mistake.

395
00:20:11,330 --> 00:20:12,120
I, Lu Lingfeng,

396
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:13,070
Thank you.

397
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:15,340
You flatter me.

398
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:17,040
You disregard our former grudges

399
00:20:17,490 --> 00:20:18,270
and invite me

400
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:19,620
to visit this stone bridge.

401
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:21,320
I am very grateful.

402
00:20:23,490 --> 00:20:24,620
Stop

403
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:25,940
thanking each other.

404
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:27,340
I only know

405
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:28,910
you young people are fast.

406
00:20:29,210 --> 00:20:30,900
It turns out that you keep running ahead of us

407
00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:32,110
just to

408
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:33,340
say something behind us.

409
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:35,070
You know

410
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:36,340
I have something to say to Xijun.

411
00:20:36,650 --> 00:20:37,550
Why are you still following us so closely?

412
00:20:38,910 --> 00:20:39,500
Fed.

413
00:20:39,910 --> 00:20:41,020
It's understandable that he is drunk again.

414
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:43,570
You, Su Wuming, the military commander

415
00:20:43,870 --> 00:20:44,910
and Xijun's sworn brother,

416
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:46,700
are still so inconsiderate?

417
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:48,950
If that's the case,

418
00:20:50,090 --> 00:20:51,670
it's my fault.

419
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:57,850
Well,

420
00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:00,440
you two may hold hands whenever you want

421
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:02,780
and whisper whenever you want.

422
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:04,780
Just pretend I can't see it.

423
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:07,150
Xijun.

424
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:14,030
Xijun,

425
00:21:14,510 --> 00:21:16,630
you and Lu Lingfeng are getting married soon.

426
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:19,220
Will I be able to drink your wedding wine

427
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:20,960
in my lifetime?

428
00:21:22,790 --> 00:21:23,310
You!

429
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:26,750
Ji Xiang is good at using hidden weapons.

430
00:21:27,210 --> 00:21:28,390
Of course, I am ashamed to use them.

431
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,400
But if you know both the enemy and yourself,

432
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:32,070
you will fight a hundred battles without danger of defeat.

433
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:33,810
I've been studying hidden weapons lately.

434
00:21:34,170 --> 00:21:34,880
How is it, Fed?

435
00:21:35,110 --> 00:21:36,900
I only used 30 percent of my power.

436
00:21:37,370 --> 00:21:38,370
Fortunately, it was 30.

437
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:39,700
If it were 70,

438
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:40,630
I

439
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:41,640
would have grown a horn on my head!

440
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:43,300
You have to discipline

441
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:44,340
your husband well!

442
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:45,650
He bullied the elderly!

443
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:47,040
And he is indebted to me!

444
00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:48,520
Still talking rubbish.

445
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:51,820
Do you want me to use a stone this time?

446
00:21:52,490 --> 00:21:52,900
You...

447
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:54,620
Help! Help!

448
00:21:54,950 --> 00:21:56,740
Su Wuming, he hit me!

449
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:58,250
He hit me with a stone!

450
00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:02,880
[Prefectural Governor's Residence]

451
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:05,290
So,

452
00:22:05,890 --> 00:22:08,710
congratulations, Brother Lu.

453
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:10,340
Sheriff of Ju County?

454
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:12,380
Though Ju County is in the corner of Nanzhou,

455
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:14,210
and the position of sheriff is not high.

456
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:15,580
But after all,

457
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:17,340
you have become a government official again.

458
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:18,610
In this way,

459
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:20,250
you can look forward to

460
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:21,360
being reinstated

461
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:22,880
or even a promotion.

462
00:22:23,270 --> 00:22:24,870
Congratulations.

463
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,680
How could the imperial court have given me such an appointment?

464
00:22:29,610 --> 00:22:30,700
That's impossible.

465
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,360
What great news!

466
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:36,860
We should have a drink tomorrow!

467
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:40,100
Su Wuming.

468
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:42,280
Did you do something behind my back?

469
00:22:43,090 --> 00:22:44,720
What could I do?

470
00:22:45,850 --> 00:22:46,830
If not,

471
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:49,170
why would I have such an appointment?

472
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:52,090
I'm in Nanzhou with you,

473
00:22:52,190 --> 00:22:53,590
far away from the capital.

474
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:55,350
And I am humble in position and have little say.

475
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:56,560
Although the position of sheriff is low,

476
00:22:56,740 --> 00:22:58,500
it is still an imperial official.

477
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:00,310
Appointing an official

478
00:23:00,570 --> 00:23:02,100
is an important matter for the imperial court.

479
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:03,500
How can I have a say in it?

480
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:07,380
The General of the Imperial Guards, Lu Lingfeng!

481
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:09,540
By knowing the law and breaking it, your crime is aggravated!

482
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:11,980
Flog him 30 times, confiscate his property,

483
00:23:12,330 --> 00:23:13,180
and expel him from Chang'an.

484
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:16,900
When I was expelled,

485
00:23:17,710 --> 00:23:19,540
it didn't say I would never be appointed again,

486
00:23:21,190 --> 00:23:23,310
but I knew my career was over.

487
00:23:25,190 --> 00:23:25,970
This appointment

488
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:28,160
is really strange.

489
00:23:30,850 --> 00:23:32,820
Then you should think about

490
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:35,540
whether you did something

491
00:23:35,870 --> 00:23:37,700
that was known to Chang'an.

492
00:23:44,870 --> 00:23:45,570
Could it be

493
00:23:46,770 --> 00:23:47,940
the letter that I asked Dugu Xiashu

494
00:23:47,970 --> 00:23:49,300
to bring to the capital?

495
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:51,390
A letter?

496
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:53,260
What letter?

497
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:54,390
Who wrote to whom?

498
00:23:55,050 --> 00:23:56,640
I asked Xijun to write to Pei Jian.

499
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:00,260
General Lu.

500
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:01,320
General Lu.

501
00:24:02,470 --> 00:24:04,500
You're really scheming.

502
00:24:05,230 --> 00:24:06,020
I swear!

503
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:07,180
I asked her to write a letter,

504
00:24:07,390 --> 00:24:08,710
on one hand, to report her safety.

505
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:09,380
On the other hand,

506
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:11,010
I worried that Scholar Dugu

507
00:24:11,050 --> 00:24:12,300
had no one to rely on in Chang'an.

508
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:13,840
It makes sense, doesn't it?

509
00:24:14,470 --> 00:24:15,620
Once Assistant Minister Pei received the letter,

510
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:17,690
he would definitely invite Dugu Xiashu to a feast.

511
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:19,260
Then he would know

512
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:22,100
that Lu Lingfeng who solved mysterious cases

513
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:23,390
and took care of his daughter all the time

514
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:25,130
in remote Nanzhou.

515
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:27,460
And he's now the acting Minister of Justice.

516
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:28,280
Well...

00:32:13,250 --> 00:32:15,920
I heard that he's a trusted aide of the city's Military Commander.

691
00:32:16,390 --> 00:32:17,310
He used to be a member of the Imperial Guards

693
00:32:19,490 --> 00:32:20,810
Isn't that the past?

694
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:22,340
Even if he was the Prime Minister before,

695
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:23,860
after demotion,

696
00:32:24,090 --> 00:32:24,510
now,

697
00:32:25,210 --> 00:32:26,590
he is only a county sheriff.

698
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:38,740
There are indeed so many old cases.

699
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:41,130
Were the former county sheriff

700
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:42,540
sleepy every day?

701
00:32:45,820 --> 00:32:46,620
Why are there

702
00:32:46,650 --> 00:32:47,890
so many rape and murder cases recently?

703
00:32:48,610 --> 00:32:50,180
Since last winter,

704
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:52,420
more than ten ladies have been murdered.

[Officer of Ju County]

706
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:54,970
They were even decapitated.

707
00:32:55,180 --> 00:32:56,590
You just stay there,

708
00:32:56,620 --> 00:32:57,540
and let the cases happen again and again?

709
00:32:58,400 --> 00:32:59,810
When the former county sheriff was here,

710
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:01,660
he also led us to investigate

711
00:33:02,350 --> 00:33:04,130
and searched the whole county.

712
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:05,390
But we couldn't find

713
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:06,930
where the murderer hid.

714
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:08,880
Besides, he committed the crime at night

715
00:33:09,190 --> 00:33:11,080
and his whereabouts were uncertain.

716
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:13,490
Some even said

717
00:33:14,150 --> 00:33:16,410
it was a white-haired ghost.

718
00:33:16,750 --> 00:33:17,510
So...

719
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:20,900
So what?

720
00:33:22,020 --> 00:33:23,170
The former county sheriff said

721
00:33:23,450 --> 00:33:24,640
we could catch the murderer if he was a human,

722
00:33:25,050 --> 00:33:26,690
but if it were a ghost,

723

[Coroner of Ju County]

724
00:33:27,030 --> 00:33:28,570
then there was nothing we could do about it.

725
00:33:29,450 --> 00:33:30,930
There is no such thing as a white-haired ghost.

726
00:33:31,210 --> 00:33:32,400
Don't mention such an excuse

727

-Yes. -Yes.

729

I heard

730
00:33:38,650 --> 00:33:40,450
there was another case 40 years ago.

731
00:33:41,850 --> 00:33:43,030
Where is the file?

732
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:45,910
This...

733
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:50,270
That case is extremely horrible.

734
00:33:50,950 --> 00:33:52,720
And it's been 40 years.

735
00:33:53,170 --> 00:33:54,450
It's better for you to not read its files.

736
00:33:54,750 --> 00:33:55,470
No way.

737
00:33:56,060 --> 00:33:56,940

Greetings, Magistrate.

750

Since you're new here,

751
00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:37,830
why do you go straight into the Western Office for work

752
00:34:38,170 --> 00:34:39,790
without seeing me first?

753
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:41,500
There are piles of old cases

in the Western Office.

755

I'm the new county sheriff,

in charge of investigation and arrest.

757
00:34:47,010 --> 00:34:48,739
It's reasonable to go to the Western Office first.

758
00:34:49,290 --> 00:34:50,060
So,

759
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:52,940
you don't know the rules of being an official?

When Chen Fan took office in the Later Han Dynasty,

762
00:34:56,980 --> 00:34:59,580
he visited celebrated scholars first and then went to his office.

I'm new to Ju County.

764

768
00:35:12,910 --> 00:35:14,390

780

Sir,

864

it's really a haunted house.

there is a ghost in the Hall of Life?

No.
