4
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:50,030
Brother Su.

5
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:51,720
Have some tea.

6
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:54,630
After we arrive in Luoyang,

7
00:01:55,729 --> 00:01:57,490
you are really happy.

8
00:01:58,630 --> 00:02:00,150
I'm your personal staff.

9
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:01,910
I've been looked down everywhere.

10
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:04,020
Why did you say that?

11
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:06,320
Are you making fun of me?

12
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:11,830
Recently, I found that you're not arrogant nor impatient.

13
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:15,030
You have been

14
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:16,340
much calmer than before.

15
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:17,260
What?

16
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:18,890
In Luoyang,

17
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:20,740
you meet a high-ranking government official?

18
00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:23,370
He promises you with bright future,

19
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:25,990
so that you are so composed?

20
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:29,540
In terms of investigation,

21
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:31,730
you're not that awesome.

22
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:34,700
But no one is more scheming

23
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:36,910
than you.

24
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:41,140
So I guess it right.

25
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:43,820
His Highness is also in Dongdu?

26
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:46,820
Did I say that?

27
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:48,820
No need.

28
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:51,790
As a trusted aide of His Highness,

29
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:53,180
you don't want me

30
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,829
to continue investigating.

31
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:57,030
Because if I find the antidote

32
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:57,980
and save Her Highness,

33
00:02:58,390 --> 00:03:00,000
there will be more trials and tribulations

34
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:02,490
for His Highness to ascend the throne.

35
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:07,720
I want to know

36
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:10,670
His Highness's true intentions.

37
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:16,850
What?

38
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:20,160
You don't want to take me to see him?

39
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,790
In fact, in the Blessing Temple,

40
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:26,550
I met Her Highness.

41
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:29,890
People used to say

42
00:03:30,329 --> 00:03:31,800
she was as strong as Empress Wu Zetian.

43
00:03:32,329 --> 00:03:33,650
But what I saw that day

44
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:35,690
is totally different.

45
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:41,630
You sympathize with her?

46
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,560
Although she's a princess,

47
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:46,940
the most powerful woman of Tang,

48
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:48,420
she is also

49
00:03:48,579 --> 00:03:50,700
a victim of the Face Flowers.

50
00:03:51,050 --> 00:03:52,470
Can't I pity her?

51
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,070
We lost the clue of the Tocharian woman

52
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:58,740
in the Sky Garden.

53
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:02,000
But the ghost fire of the Paradise Inn

54
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:02,890
is still on.

55
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:04,700
I, Su Wuming,

56
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:06,850
will try my best to investigate the case.

57
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,550
Dongdu was the place

58
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:11,460
I followed Detective Di at the beginning.

59
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,060
If I give up the case easily,

60
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:18,779
I will make all Master Di's edification wasted.

61
00:04:19,610 --> 00:04:21,089
Don't you think about

62
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:21,649
the country?

63
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:26,210
Last time I went south,

64
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,330
I began to have a new understanding

65
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:30,020
of the word "country".

66
00:04:30,890 --> 00:04:31,630
The country

67
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,430
include all the people in the world.

68
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:36,480
Her Highness is a member of the people.

69
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:36,930
Therefore,

70
00:04:37,659 --> 00:04:38,640
for the sake of the country,

71
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:42,690
I must make my contributions.

72
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:49,300
Her Highness is in the Blessing Temple.

73
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:51,470
You should visit her.

74
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,210
Maybe

75
00:04:53,659 --> 00:04:55,630
you'll have a new impression of her.

76
00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:07,450
[Blessing Temple]

77
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:09,150
You're here.

78
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:18,810
Excuse me.

79
00:05:19,170 --> 00:05:19,660
Wasn't here

80
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:21,210
the Serenity Temple?

81
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:23,820
When did it become the Blessing Temple?

82
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:26,380
It was changed two years ago.

83
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:29,080
I heard it was the idea of Her Highness.

84
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:30,340
Her Highness?

85
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:30,860
Yes.

86
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:33,700
Her Highness likes this temple very much.

87
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:34,930
Every time she comes to Dongdu,

88
00:05:35,170 --> 00:05:36,670
she would stay here for a few days.

89
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:39,250
She will send someone to repair it every two years.

90
00:05:39,659 --> 00:05:40,570
Now this place

91
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:41,650
is the biggest temple

92
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:43,260
in Luoyang.

93
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:45,780
Thank you, sir.

94
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:51,980
Yang Ji.

95
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:53,700
Yang Ji.

96
00:05:59,060 --> 00:05:59,620
Yang Ji.

97
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:02,460
-Come back for dinner. -Coming.

98
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:21,100
Isn't it a pleasure

99
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:22,880
to study and practice what you have learned?

100
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:25,510
Isn't it a pleasure

101
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:27,320
to study and practice what you have learned?

102
00:06:27,850 --> 00:06:30,050
Isn't it also great

103
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:31,930
when friends visit from distant places?

104
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:34,900
Isn't it also great

105
00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:36,450
when friends visit from distant places?

106
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:38,500
If people do not recognize me and it doesn't bother me,

107
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,960
am I not a noble man?

108
00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:43,340
If people do not recognize me and it doesn't bother me,

109
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,030
am I not a noble man?

110
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:45,820
Little master.

111
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:47,130
Okay, kids.

112
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:48,420
Let's do it again.

113
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:49,460
May I ask

114
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:52,460
why is there a school in this temple?

115
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:53,670
The Living Bodhisattva asked the temple

116
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:55,000
to take them in.

117
00:06:55,030 --> 00:06:55,950
Those who are willing to study

118
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:57,190
can come here to study.

119
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:58,220
There are dozens of schools like this

120
00:06:58,220 --> 00:06:59,950
in the Blessing Temple.

121
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:01,450
Teachers are paid by

122
00:07:01,450 --> 00:07:02,380
the Living Bodhisattva.

123
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:03,420
They are all knowledgeable.

124
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:05,110
Living Bodhisattva?

125
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:06,460
That is Her Highness.

126
00:07:06,670 --> 00:07:08,870
Isn't it also great

127
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,680
when friends visit from distant places?

128
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:14,840
Madam.

129
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:22,180
Greetings, Living Bodhisattva.

130
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:23,730
Go and play.

131
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:29,350
How many children

132
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:30,420
are there in the Blessing Temple?

133
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:34,740
More than 360.

134
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:36,220
Tell the monks.

135
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:38,060
Those who have nowhere to go

136
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:39,550
and come to the Blessing Temple

137
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:40,730
should be all accepted.

138
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:44,530
I'll take care of the children of Tang.

139
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:45,370
Yes.

140
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:06,240
Why did he run away?

141
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:07,740
He wouldn't let me hug him.

142
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:10,700
He must hate me.

143
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:14,110
Your Highness, you took him in.

144
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:15,790
Why would he hate you?

145
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:18,940
He must be too young

146
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:20,890
to meet strangers.

147
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:22,200
No.

148
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:25,360
He must hate me

149
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:27,820
and won't forgive me.

150
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:47,620
Where are you going?

151
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:48,940
What do you think?

152
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,120
I'm going to investigate.

153
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:53,730
Do you still believe

154
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:55,340
you can find the lost lead in that inn?

155
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:58,260
I hope this time

156
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:00,140
I can find new clues.

157
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:02,210
But what reason should we have

158
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:02,890
to go back again?

159
00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:05,420
We?

160
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:07,820
Can you draw out

161
00:09:08,410 --> 00:09:10,010
the bronze devil by yourself?

162
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,560
How do you know I can't?

163
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:17,710
Of course.

164
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,040
With your help,

165
00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:20,440
it will be easier for me. That's all.

166
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:22,640
That's all?

167
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:26,270
Fine.

168
00:09:27,310 --> 00:09:28,360
I'm your subordinate.

169
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:29,860
You can say whatever you want.

170
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:34,750
What did you say

171
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:36,330
to that Lady Hu Shisi?

172
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:37,710
I said I was an exorcist,

173
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:38,700
coming from the south.

174
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:40,310
And I was invited to exorcise devils in Dongdu.

175
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:41,990
OK.

176
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:44,260
This is a good title.

177
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:45,340
We go back

178
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:47,460
to exorcise devils.

179
00:10:19,570 --> 00:10:20,740
You again?

180
00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:22,510
You scared my man.

181
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,640
Why is there no one

182
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:26,180
in your inn today?

183
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:28,160
A dead body came back to life

184
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:29,860
and was haunted by ghosts.

185
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:32,050
Someone held a knife

186
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:33,930
to harass me on my bed.

187
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:36,540
The guests were all scared away.

188
00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:38,570
Even those girls who were playing the pipa fled.

189
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:40,890
You ruined my inn.

190
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:42,300
You have to pay for it.

191
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:43,540
Look.

192
00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:44,870
She's blackmailing us.

193
00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:48,290
You can't leave if you don't pay today.

194
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:49,380
Close the door.

195
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:56,740
We didn't want to come back.

196
00:10:57,580 --> 00:10:59,120
We were about to leave for Chang'an.

197
00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:01,140
But when we passed by your inn,

198
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:02,830
the people around said

199
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:03,780
your inn

200
00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:04,910
would be haunted by ghosts

201
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:06,570
every night.

202
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:08,640
I recalled what happened that night.

203
00:11:09,050 --> 00:11:10,370
I think they are right.

204
00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:13,120
The people

205
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:15,120
asked me and my servant

206
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:16,650
to exorcise the devils.

207
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:19,520
It's hard for us to refuse.

208
00:11:20,330 --> 00:11:21,500
But now you blackmail us.

209
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:22,710
Is it appropriate?

210
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:25,020
My master is right.

211
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:28,180
How can you catch ghosts?

212
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:30,250
A man's mouth...

213
00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:32,340
There's a saying.

214
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:34,130
What is it?

215
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:35,620
A man's mouth

216
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:37,030
can only lie.

217
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:38,660
He knows everything.

218
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:39,650
In particular,

219
00:11:40,490 --> 00:11:41,720
a man

220
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:43,450
who has your appearance

221
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:46,340
tells nothing but lies.

222
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:48,850
Stop looking.

223
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,840
You'll be seduced.

224
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:53,440
Get out!

225
00:12:11,210 --> 00:12:11,800
Stop!

226
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:14,520
Look at your height.

227
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:15,450
And look at his height.

228
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,350
If you kill him,

229
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:17,340
you bully him.

230
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:19,260
I wanted to catch ghosts for your inn,

231
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:22,020
but you are ungrateful for our kindness.

232
00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:23,990
We're leaving.

233
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:34,280
Since you're willing to catch ghosts for us,

234
00:12:34,890 --> 00:12:36,090
I

235
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:37,820
would like you to do so.

236
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:40,530
The best guest room upstairs.

237
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:42,060
Suit yourselves.

238
00:12:42,290 --> 00:12:42,940
Help yourself.

239
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:44,400
Eat and drink.

240
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:46,300
I will serve you well.

241
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:49,940
Master,

242
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:52,780
why don't we stay here?

243
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:54,820
I'm hungry.

244
00:12:57,550 --> 00:12:58,170
Fine.

245
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:00,760
But

246
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,310
forget about the room upstairs.

247
00:13:02,730 --> 00:13:03,680
My servant and I

248
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:05,650
like the guest rooms in the backyard,

249
00:13:05,810 --> 00:13:07,460
especially the one where someone died.

250
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:08,790
The yinqi is strong there.

251
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:10,340
It's easy to catch ghosts.

252
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:24,620
When we first came here,

253
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:27,870
we didn't bring much money.

254
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:32,220
So what do they gangsters want?

255
00:13:34,770 --> 00:13:35,610
And that

256
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,160
bronze devil.

257
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:39,560
It seems that his purpose

258
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:40,900
is to assassinate you.

259
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:43,340
It has raised a big rumpus.

260
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:45,370
Who ordered him to do this?

261
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:47,940
Right.

262
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:50,770
I have no official position,

263
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:51,850
nor money.

264
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:54,110
Why should he kill me?

265
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,500
Unless he mistook me for someone else.

266
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:02,260
What did you say?

267
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:05,960
Nothing.

268
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:11,240
Who is that?

269
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:13,220
It's me.

270
00:14:17,650 --> 00:14:18,850
Are you guys digging the ground

271
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:20,540
in this room?

272
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:23,060
Do you catch the ghost?

273
00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:24,140
We don't need to dig deep

274
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:26,140
to catch the ghost.

275
00:14:27,410 --> 00:14:29,140
The ghost is right in front of me.

276
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:29,930
Bah!

277
00:14:30,730 --> 00:14:32,730
Have you ever seen a ghost as beautiful as me?

278
00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:35,910
You used to serve the Emperor of Sui.

279
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:37,840
Now you serve

280
00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:40,110
my servant and I.

281
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:41,460
It is our honor.

282
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:44,850
You finally believe

283
00:14:45,730 --> 00:14:47,040
I'm from Sui.

284
00:14:48,210 --> 00:14:50,510
Then you can tell my master

285
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:52,140
some stories about the Sui Dynasty.

286
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:53,140
For example,

287
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:55,870
when Emperor Yang was killed in Jiangdu,

288
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:57,110
were you by his side

289
00:14:57,140 --> 00:14:58,300
or in the imperial court of Chang'an?

290
00:14:58,340 --> 00:14:59,500
Why was I in Chang'an?

291
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:00,530
At that time, Emperor Yang

292
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:01,530
had already moved to Luoyang.

293
00:15:05,610 --> 00:15:06,540
You were

294
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:08,350
testing me.

295
00:15:10,290 --> 00:15:11,430
I am still beautiful,

296
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,800
right?

297
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:24,510
Actually,

298
00:15:25,810 --> 00:15:27,740
Emperor Yang is the most beautiful person

299
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:31,340
I have seen in my life.

300
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:34,970
Not only is he handsome,

301
00:15:36,510 --> 00:15:38,420
but also his skin is flexible.

302
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:40,550
He asked Persians

303
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:41,780
to offer the Face Flowers.

304
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:43,930
They were not for us,

305
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:46,970
but for himself.

306
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:54,750
This is sweet pear syrup

307
00:15:54,770 --> 00:15:55,890
I made for you.

308
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:58,500
It was my favorite in the imperial court.

309
00:15:59,370 --> 00:16:00,130
Try it.

310
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:11,960
Paradise Inn.

311
00:16:13,050 --> 00:16:15,050
Also means a Sui inn.

312
00:16:16,170 --> 00:16:17,710
Unbelievable.

313
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:19,630
Tonight,

314
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:22,130
if something really attacks us,

315
00:16:23,290 --> 00:16:26,130
it must be the devil of the Sui Dynasty.

316
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:47,050
Will this bronze devil

317
00:16:47,610 --> 00:16:48,780
attack us again?

318
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:49,750
Absolutely.

319
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:50,810
Why?

320
00:16:53,970 --> 00:16:55,760
Because someone wants to kill you.

321
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:57,460
He failed last time.

322
00:16:57,580 --> 00:17:00,420
Now you're here again.

323
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:06,410
What are you doing?

324
00:17:07,099 --> 00:17:08,150
It's late.

325
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:09,520
Of course I'm going to bed.

326
00:17:09,690 --> 00:17:10,450
No more ghost-hunting?

327
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:13,619
It's your business.

328
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:15,220
I won't add to your trouble.

329
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:17,440
Don't sleep.

330
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:19,400
Tell me.

331
00:17:20,349 --> 00:17:21,430
Is that Lady Hu Shisi

332
00:17:21,490 --> 00:17:22,560
really over 100 years old?

333
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:24,180
I don't think so.

334
00:17:25,430 --> 00:17:27,220
That night, she said she used the Face Flowers

335
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:28,420
to keep youth.

336
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:30,820
Could it be true?

337
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:32,590
The Face Flowers

338
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:34,060
were

339
00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:37,060
presented by Persians to the former Emperor Yang of the Sui Dynasty.

340
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:39,480
Maybe she didn't lie.

341
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:41,180
But

342
00:17:41,210 --> 00:17:43,580
a 100-year-old woman of Sui

343
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:46,000
can still giggle and flirt in front of me.

344
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:47,420
I don't believe it.

345
00:17:48,270 --> 00:17:50,470
It was quite scary at first.

346
00:17:50,610 --> 00:17:51,510
But now,

347
00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:54,060
I think I already know

348
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:55,090
who she is.

349
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:25,330
Who's that?

350
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:29,140
The light is off. You don't even drink.

351
00:18:31,130 --> 00:18:32,250
Do you have wine?

352
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:34,150
The best wine.

353
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:36,600
The owner wants to drink with you.

354
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:38,730
Really?

355
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:40,590
Tell her.

356
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:42,180
Prepare wine and dishes.

357
00:18:42,590 --> 00:18:43,350
Coming.

358
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:44,780
Okay.

359
00:18:57,620 --> 00:18:58,210
Lu Lingfeng.

360
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:00,900
Is the bronze devi

361
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:01,720
that you saw that day

362
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:02,260
taller than

363
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:03,680
this big guy?

364
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:07,110
Much taller.

365
00:19:09,770 --> 00:19:12,350
How is it compared to

366
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:13,780
the giant in the Ghost Four?

367
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:16,330
A bit taller.

368
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:24,020
There is no devil in this world.

369
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:26,420
That bronze devil

370
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:28,500
must be disguised by someone.

371
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:51,340
What?

372
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:53,660
You dare not drink?

373
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:56,580
I really dare not.

374
00:19:58,060 --> 00:19:59,060
Such good wine.

375
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,740
I don't want to give it to you.

376
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:02,100
Here.

377
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:03,440
Let's drink together.

378
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:05,820
Don't waste the great time tonight.

379
00:20:06,910 --> 00:20:08,550
It's hard to refuse your hospitality.

380
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:10,480
Cheers.

381
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:20,380
It was at the same night like this

382
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:24,920
that I arrived in Luoyang for the first time.

383
00:20:26,330 --> 00:20:28,460
Emperor Yang returned from hunting with harvests.

384
00:20:29,450 --> 00:20:30,630
He was very happy.

385
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:33,030
He asked us to drink with him.

386
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:36,530
He even asked me

387
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:37,820
to play the pipa.

388
00:20:38,330 --> 00:20:38,970
What?

389
00:20:39,770 --> 00:20:41,900
Are you going to play

390
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:43,060
the pipa for us?

391
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:45,490
Of course you don't deserve it.

392
00:20:46,190 --> 00:20:47,220
But for him,

393
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:49,530
I would like to.

394
00:20:51,170 --> 00:20:51,700
In that case,

395
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:52,680
thank you.

396
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:09,530
Emperor Yang indeed had a lot of good fortune in love affairs.

397
00:21:10,390 --> 00:21:11,800
Lady Hu Shisi

398
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:14,740
is both beautiful and talented.

399
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:16,850
Do you really like her?

400
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:19,460
But she's over 100 years old.

401
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:20,700
She's old.

402
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:44,200
Oh no.

403
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:45,590
The wine...

404
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,270
Not the wine.

405
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,980
I feel dizzy even if I didn't drink.

406
00:21:56,740 --> 00:21:57,380
Stop playing.

407
00:21:59,060 --> 00:21:59,700
What?

408
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:01,570
Did I play badly?

409
00:22:11,850 --> 00:22:13,260
I didn't play well.

410
00:22:13,690 --> 00:22:15,050
I've brought the ghost here.

411
00:22:49,530 --> 00:22:51,180
What smooth martial arts skills!

412
00:22:51,430 --> 00:22:53,390
May I entertain you?

413
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:19,560
Lu Lingfeng!

414
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:21,370
It's not about the wine!

415
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:23,280
It's her pipa song!

416
00:23:32,470 --> 00:23:33,140
Now you know

417
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:34,390
how powerful my pipa song is!

418
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:35,440
It's too late!

419
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:37,950
You can only blame yourself for being worth a lot.

420
00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:40,220
Stay here forever!

421
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:52,280
Lu Lingfeng!

422
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:54,580
Escape from the back door!

423
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:56,140
Then you won't hear

424
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:57,730
her stupid pipa noise!

425
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:05,850
Let's see where you can hide!

426
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:49,930
Master!

427
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:51,260
-Take your spear! -Take your spear!

428
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:19,410
I heard you're from the Sui Dynasty.

429
00:25:20,130 --> 00:25:21,960
A100-year old witch.

430
00:25:22,050 --> 00:25:23,840
Can I call you my great grandmother?

431
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:25,660
How dare you set up an ambush

432
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:26,860
in my inn!

433
00:25:27,290 --> 00:25:28,700
I'll skin you alive!

434
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:40,520
Yingtao.

435
00:25:41,190 --> 00:25:41,690
Step back!

436
00:25:42,390 --> 00:25:43,560
Wait for me to take her down!

437
00:25:45,290 --> 00:25:45,900
Not now!

438
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:47,750
Wh...What?

439
00:25:48,290 --> 00:25:49,100
You don't trust me?

440
00:25:49,850 --> 00:25:51,310
That's because you have never seen

441
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:53,580
my power to subdue demons.

442
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:54,570
Step back!

443
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:10,430
You despicable scoundrel!

444
00:26:10,690 --> 00:26:12,130
How dare you attack me with your hidden weapon!

445
00:26:12,570 --> 00:26:14,730
I learned it from you.

446
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:18,150
Don't worry. You won't be blind.

447
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:20,020
Tie her up.

448
00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:21,260
Don't keep fighting with him.

449
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:22,310
Take this!

450
00:26:39,050 --> 00:26:39,830
Ouch!

451
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:41,430
Let him taste

452
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:42,800
my chicken-roasting magic oil!

453
00:27:02,850 --> 00:27:03,640
What are you fumbling?

454
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,240
Your legs are still there!

455
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:07,100
My blade is not sharpened.

456
00:27:07,870 --> 00:27:09,870
Otherwise, you'll become him.

457
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:16,030
You guessed it right again.

458
00:27:16,930 --> 00:27:19,070
When the bronze devil appeares,

459
00:27:19,470 --> 00:27:21,980
they will not be in the inn.

460
00:27:22,250 --> 00:27:25,680
I knew it then.

461
00:27:26,690 --> 00:27:27,930
Why am I getting more and more confused?

462
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:29,940
All right, let's have a drink.

463
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:30,530
Wait.

464
00:27:33,090 --> 00:27:35,570
Such a giant figure.

465
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:36,840
Could it be two people?

466
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:38,240
Two?

467
00:27:38,570 --> 00:27:40,100
Don't you see

468
00:27:40,130 --> 00:27:41,130
how agile that dwarf is?

469
00:27:41,390 --> 00:27:42,950
And even Lady Hu Shisi

470
00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:44,290
can hold him in her arms.

471
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:48,140
You mean that strong man and that dwarf?

472
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:51,230
However,

473
00:27:52,350 --> 00:27:53,540
I've figured out a way

474
00:27:53,990 --> 00:27:55,540
to deal with that bronze armor.

475
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:58,850
At that time, my disciple, Xue Huan,

476
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:00,340
and Fed

477
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:01,660
will help me catch that devil.

478
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:16,540
The Face Flower

479
00:28:16,580 --> 00:28:18,300
you brought from the former Sui Palace

480
00:28:18,410 --> 00:28:19,700
is really amazing.

481
00:28:20,130 --> 00:28:21,490
You are over 100,

482
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:23,850
but your face is still as attractive as a young woman.

483
00:28:24,690 --> 00:28:26,540
How, how about you stay with me?

484
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:27,500
I don't mind that you are 100.

485
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:28,060
Fuck off!

486
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:29,530
Stinky beggar!

487
00:28:29,570 --> 00:28:30,640
How dare you tease a imperial concubine?

488
00:28:31,370 --> 00:28:33,570
How arrogant!

489
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:36,350
There were indeed a lot of women

490
00:28:36,390 --> 00:28:37,540
in Emperor Yang of Sui's palace.

491
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:38,830
And their titles

492
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:40,830
were given by him.

493
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:43,180
The imperial concubines Gui, Shu, and De

494
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:44,690
are the Three Madams.

495
00:28:46,570 --> 00:28:47,340
May I ask

496
00:28:47,890 --> 00:28:49,450
which title is yours?

497
00:28:51,090 --> 00:28:51,730
Say it！

498
00:28:53,930 --> 00:28:54,800
Well...

499
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:57,180
There were Nine Concubines of Shunyi, Shunrong, Shunhua,

500
00:28:57,340 --> 00:28:59,090
Xiuyi, Xiurong, Xiuhua,

501
00:28:59,290 --> 00:29:01,340
Chongyi, Chongrong, and Chonghua.

502
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:02,700
The nine titles,

503
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:04,820
which one is yours?

504
00:29:05,550 --> 00:29:06,230
Why don't you say it?

505
00:29:08,050 --> 00:29:09,020
None of them?

506
00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:12,010
Then,

507
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:15,600
there are 12 Mistresses,

508
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:18,700
15 Beauties, 15 Talents,

509
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:21,000
24 Ladies,

510
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:22,980
and 37 Lady-in-waitings.

511
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:24,960
Lady Hu Shisi.

512
00:29:26,050 --> 00:29:27,750
Which rank is yours?

513
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:30,570
Say it!

514
00:29:31,090 --> 00:29:32,680
How dare you call yourself a imperial concubine?

515
00:29:33,030 --> 00:29:34,080
I think you were

516
00:29:34,110 --> 00:29:35,390
just a maid besides that emperor

517
00:29:35,420 --> 00:29:36,740
whom everyone hated.

518
00:29:36,770 --> 00:29:38,000
Don't you insult His Majesty!

519
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:38,660
Shut up!

520
00:29:39,370 --> 00:29:41,330
You were born in Tang and grew up in Tang,

521
00:29:41,610 --> 00:29:43,870
yet you regard the last dynasty's foolish emperor as your king.

522
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:44,610
What do you want?

523
00:29:47,030 --> 00:29:48,820
Don't think I don't know who you are.

524
00:29:48,950 --> 00:29:49,610
Let me ask you.

525
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:54,210
What's your relationship with Ms. Caihan?

526
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:58,950
Tell me the truth.

527
00:30:01,370 --> 00:30:02,450
That's her mother.

528
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:03,050
You!

529
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:10,510
I see.

530
00:30:11,150 --> 00:30:13,900
There were many mysterious cases in Luoyang 20 years ago.

531
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:15,290
The culprit

532
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:17,000
was that Ms. Caihan.

533
00:30:17,270 --> 00:30:19,330
When she was arrested, an accomplice

534
00:30:19,370 --> 00:30:20,310
escaped.

535
00:30:22,270 --> 00:30:24,110
That accomplice should be you.

536
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:33,980
You...

537
00:30:34,830 --> 00:30:36,180
How do you know everything?

538
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:39,020
They didn't let you go on purpose back then.

539
00:30:39,550 --> 00:30:40,710
It was because

540
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:41,510
you were just

541
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:43,220
a teenager.

542
00:30:43,460 --> 00:30:44,710
My teacher, Detective Di,

543
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:46,850
wanted to spare your life.

544
00:30:47,150 --> 00:30:48,040
I didn't expect

545
00:30:48,490 --> 00:30:50,920
you followed in your mother's steps

546
00:30:50,990 --> 00:30:51,960
and did all evil things.

547
00:30:55,030 --> 00:30:55,620
Su Wuming.

548
00:30:56,180 --> 00:30:57,380
Just now, Chicken Fed said

549
00:30:57,620 --> 00:30:58,950
she was a maid of the Sui.

550
00:30:59,610 --> 00:31:00,860
Now she even has a mother.

551
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:02,220
What's going on?

552
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:08,100
After Emperor Yang of Sui was killed in Jiangdu,

553
00:31:08,510 --> 00:31:10,350
a palace maid

554
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:12,720
escaped from the Palace.

555
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:15,490
That dried Face Flower

556
00:31:15,510 --> 00:31:17,280
should be brought out by her.

557
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:19,950
That palace maid knew martial arts.

558
00:31:20,650 --> 00:31:22,780
And all she wanted was to avenge the Emperor Yang.

559
00:31:22,810 --> 00:31:25,220
But the person who killed the Emperor

560
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:27,640
also died in chaos.

561
00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:31,070
So she turned her hatred to the Tang.

562
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:34,680
But His Majesty is heavily guarded.

563
00:31:34,790 --> 00:31:36,670
How could they give her a chance?

564
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:41,150
But the maid didn't give up.

565
00:31:41,530 --> 00:31:43,070
She passed on her skills

566
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:45,380
and some rules in the Sui Palace

567
00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:47,340
to her daughter.

568
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:50,270
She asked her daughter to be her

569
00:31:50,490 --> 00:31:52,340
and continue to do evil things.

570
00:31:53,380 --> 00:31:54,200
Lady Hu Shisi.

571
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:56,540
At least,

572
00:31:56,900 --> 00:32:00,030
you should be the fifth generation.

573
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:02,810
Now that you know everything,

574
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:04,940
why bother talking?

575
00:32:06,610 --> 00:32:07,380
Kill me!

576
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:11,920
In your generation,

577
00:32:12,330 --> 00:32:14,060
if you wanted to assassinate the Emperor,

578
00:32:15,070 --> 00:32:16,700
it would be a daydream.

579
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:19,250
So you raised

580
00:32:19,290 --> 00:32:20,680
these two men

581
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:22,740
and opened this gangster inn here

582
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:25,400
to kill people for their money.

583
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:26,820
Is this true or not?

584
00:32:30,050 --> 00:32:30,490
Sir.

585
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:34,890
These were found in the storage in the backyard.

586
00:32:41,730 --> 00:32:44,200
All these years, a lot of people

587
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:45,380
have died in your inn.

588
00:32:47,420 --> 00:32:51,030
You just said his life was worth a lot.

589
00:32:51,050 --> 00:32:52,050
What do you mean?

590
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:54,790
You assassinated him twice.

591
00:32:55,060 --> 00:32:57,100
Were you hired?

592
00:32:57,770 --> 00:32:59,330
Who hired you?

593
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:00,850
Tell me!

594
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:15,420
Who will stay in my inn?

595
00:33:16,130 --> 00:33:17,440
How come he would be worth this much?

596
00:33:18,050 --> 00:33:19,820
If you want silver ingots,

597
00:33:20,050 --> 00:33:21,290
don't ask that much.

598
00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:24,510
I'll double the ingots when it's done.

599
00:33:24,950 --> 00:33:25,890
He said

600
00:33:27,310 --> 00:33:30,070
one master and one servant would come and stay in my inn that night.

601
00:33:30,710 --> 00:33:31,530
The master is

602
00:33:31,570 --> 00:33:33,370
a noble and tall young man.

603
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:36,830
He asked us to kill him.

604
00:33:37,450 --> 00:33:39,430
One master and one servant.

605
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:41,870
Then you two came.

606
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:45,050
I thought the person who paid me

607
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:48,130
must have wanted me to kill him.

608
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:50,830
So I lured him to the attic.

609
00:33:51,330 --> 00:33:53,260
Then you used the knockout incense to me.

610
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:56,470
I didn't expect you to have such strong willpower.

611
00:33:57,010 --> 00:33:58,200
You even fought with my men

612
00:33:59,010 --> 00:34:01,230
after you had inhaled my incense.

613
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:02,750
Do you think

614
00:34:02,780 --> 00:34:04,500
I am one of the lechers in your Sui Palace?

615
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:08,199
What can a mere Husband Fragrance do to me?

616
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:09,030
How do you know

617
00:34:09,050 --> 00:34:10,139
I used the Husband Incense?

618
00:34:10,580 --> 00:34:12,900
It is mainly Baohuang from the Western Region,

619
00:34:13,380 --> 00:34:16,060
with a small amount of Guichou from the Miao ethnic group, right?

620
00:34:16,489 --> 00:34:17,600
Of course he doesn't know.

621
00:34:17,659 --> 00:34:18,870
I told him.

622
00:34:19,170 --> 00:34:21,420
You wouldn't say

623
00:34:21,449 --> 00:34:23,610
this was brought out by your grandmother's grandmother's grandmother

624
00:34:23,810 --> 00:34:25,699
from the Palace of Sui, would you?

625
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:28,460
Even if there was,

626
00:34:28,610 --> 00:34:30,719
it's been over 100 years.

627
00:34:30,739 --> 00:34:32,040
Your incense must be ineffective.

628
00:34:32,739 --> 00:34:35,250
Guichou is sold on the market.

629
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:37,880
But the wicked Baohuang

630
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:39,570
has been banned long ago.

631
00:34:39,940 --> 00:34:41,360
So-called contraband goods

632
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:46,739
are just goods sold secretly.

633
00:34:53,239 --> 00:34:55,969
It depends on whether you can find a seller.

634
00:35:01,020 --> 00:35:02,190
Then where did you

635
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:05,170
get it?

636
00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:08,130
Sangshan Shop.

637
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:13,740
Hall of Medicine.

638
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:14,540
Yingtao.

639
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,410
Take her back to the Administrator's Residence,

640
00:35:16,850 --> 00:35:18,070
let her describe

641
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:19,790
the person who hired her to assassinate,

642
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:21,940
and ask Xijun to draw it.

643
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:23,580
Got it.

644
00:35:28,970 --> 00:35:29,450
Xing Ying.

645
00:35:29,490 --> 00:35:29,860
Yes.

646
00:35:30,890 --> 00:35:32,130
I'll leave these two to you.

647
00:35:32,730 --> 00:35:33,450
Put them in jail,

648
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:34,750
and wait for their sentences.

649
00:35:35,140 --> 00:35:35,510
Yes.

650
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:38,350
[Paradise Inn]

651
00:35:51,740 --> 00:35:52,480
Lu Lingfeng.

652
00:35:53,620 --> 00:35:56,210
Has the Crown Prince stayed here before?

653
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:00,390
Great General.

654
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:01,780
It's inconvenient to talk here.

655
00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:02,540
Let's go inside.

656
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:09,620
Greetings, Your Highness.

657
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:12,520
Get up.

658
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:16,390
Your Highness.

659
00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:18,380
I heard that

660
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:20,080
you've returned to Chang'an.

661
00:36:21,940 --> 00:36:22,900
The truth or falsehood

662
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:24,190
is all strategy.

663
00:36:25,050 --> 00:36:26,980
Just like when His Highness

664
00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:28,540
ordered me to expel you from Chang'an.

665
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:30,410
We didn't really mean to punish you.

666
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:32,190
Your Highness.

667
00:36:32,990 --> 00:36:34,130
I heard that

668
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:36,740
the princess wanted to

669
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:37,570
frame you for a bigger case.

670
00:36:38,060 --> 00:36:39,380
If I don't kick you out in time,

671
00:36:39,730 --> 00:36:40,700
you and I may not be able to

672
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:42,470
meet again today.

673
00:36:44,390 --> 00:36:45,120
Lu Lingfeng.

674
00:36:45,610 --> 00:36:46,570
Although I'm the Crown Prince,

675
00:36:47,180 --> 00:36:48,110
I'm weak.

676
00:36:49,060 --> 00:36:50,050
I can only protect you

677
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:50,710
in this way.

678
00:36:51,860 --> 00:36:52,920
I've made you suffer.

679
00:36:56,290 --> 00:36:57,170
I am slow-witted,

680
00:36:57,550 --> 00:36:58,790
and blame you wrongly all the time.

681
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:01,070
I still

682
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:03,300
resented you.

683
00:37:04,860 --> 00:37:05,820
Great General, look.

684
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:06,590
This is why

685
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:07,820
I admire Lu Lingfeng.

686
00:37:08,140 --> 00:37:10,460
He is always honest.

687
00:37:11,250 --> 00:37:11,900
Get up.

688
00:37:13,740 --> 00:37:14,970
Did you find anything

689
00:37:15,370 --> 00:37:16,280
with Su Wuming in the south?

690
00:37:17,180 --> 00:37:18,140
This trip to the south

691
00:37:18,550 --> 00:37:19,380
made me go to some placecs that are very remote.

692
00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:20,580
I saw

693
00:37:20,620 --> 00:37:21,620
the lowest people

694
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:24,680
and the hardest life.

695
00:37:26,090 --> 00:37:26,990
I also felt

696
00:37:27,650 --> 00:37:28,530
the people of our Tang

697
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:30,260
are very kind and tough.

698
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:31,580
Your Highness.

699
00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:33,800
Chang'an and Luoyang

700
00:37:34,580 --> 00:37:35,430
are the most prosperous cities

701
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:36,600
in the world.

702
00:37:37,610 --> 00:37:38,630
But the prosperity there

703
00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:41,020
can't represent everything of the Tang.

704
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:43,740
Those people from the remote provinces

705
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:46,080
are also the people of Tang.

706
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:48,960
We shouldn't forget them.

707
00:37:51,150 --> 00:37:52,340
Forgive me for being blunt.

708
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:54,420
If they can't live in peace

709
00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:55,950
and can't live well,

710
00:37:57,340 --> 00:37:58,580
the prosperous Tang

711
00:37:59,290 --> 00:38:00,640
will never come.

712
00:38:01,270 --> 00:38:02,080
Well said!

713
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:11,450
If I ascend the throne successfully,

714
00:38:12,020 --> 00:38:13,390
I won't let you down.

715
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:15,260
I will creat a real prosperous society

716
00:38:15,740 --> 00:38:17,350
for the people.

717
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:21,750
But I still don't understand.

718
00:38:22,570 --> 00:38:24,380
Why did the Crown Prince choose this little inn

719
00:38:24,570 --> 00:38:27,310
in the big city of Luoyang.

720
00:38:33,610 --> 00:38:34,380
I also asked His Highness

721
00:38:36,390 --> 00:38:37,540
about this question.

722
00:38:39,530 --> 00:38:42,760
I heard that the suspect who sold the Face Flower

723
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:44,140
committed suicide here.

724
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:46,080
So I wanted to stay here

725
00:38:46,940 --> 00:38:47,700
to see if I could

726
00:38:47,730 --> 00:38:49,090
find some clues.

727
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:52,430
But the Great General says

728
00:38:52,970 --> 00:38:54,050
this inn is strange.

729
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:55,180
He won't allow me

730
00:38:55,180 --> 00:38:56,140
to leave this room.

731
00:38:56,380 --> 00:38:57,170
Yes, Your Highness.

732
00:38:58,490 --> 00:38:59,720
Just now, a bronze devil

733
00:39:00,020 --> 00:39:00,850
assassinated me.

734
00:39:01,420 --> 00:39:02,580
The identity of the female owner

735
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:04,040
is also unknown.

736
00:39:04,540 --> 00:39:05,980
General Lu was the one who was assassinated

737
00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:07,900
instead of His Highness.

738
00:39:08,450 --> 00:39:09,250
That means

739
00:39:09,610 --> 00:39:10,870
they haven't found

740
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:13,110
His Highness is hiding here.

741
00:39:13,730 --> 00:39:15,300
But it's indeed not safe here.

742
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:18,290
I advise leaving this inn as soon as possible.

743
00:39:18,610 --> 00:39:19,410
Your Highness,

744
00:39:19,550 --> 00:39:21,180
you should return to Chang'an soon.

745
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:23,340
I thought

746
00:39:24,250 --> 00:39:25,670
even if

747
00:39:25,690 --> 00:39:27,190
your life is so valuable,

748
00:39:27,220 --> 00:39:28,940
you aren't worth that much money.

749
00:39:29,330 --> 00:39:30,800
That time, it was Great General Lu

750
00:39:30,830 --> 00:39:31,730
who checked in alone.

751
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:35,030
His Highness didn't take the front door.

752
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:36,440
So,

753
00:39:37,210 --> 00:39:38,960
Lady Hu Shisi mistook His Highness for me.

754
00:39:39,590 --> 00:39:40,300
Lu Lingfeng.

755
00:39:41,050 --> 00:39:43,370
This time Her Highness is in trouble.

756
00:39:44,180 --> 00:39:46,380
I don't think you care much about solving this case

757
00:39:46,420 --> 00:39:48,530
and getting the antidote.

758
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:50,380
To be frank,

759
00:39:53,260 --> 00:39:56,990
is it His Highness's order?

760
00:39:57,020 --> 00:39:57,600
Su Wuming.

761
00:40:01,060 --> 00:40:01,960
You can look down on me,

762
00:40:02,580 --> 00:40:03,580
but you can't

763
00:40:03,580 --> 00:40:04,380
look down on His Highness.

764
00:40:05,010 --> 00:40:06,430
His Highness stayed here

765
00:40:07,170 --> 00:40:09,200
not to inquire about the Princess's life,

766
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:12,160
but...

767
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:13,540
Your Highness.

768
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:14,930
I think what General Lu said

769
00:40:14,950 --> 00:40:15,740
makes sense.

770
00:40:16,030 --> 00:40:16,870
You should

771
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:17,820
return to Chang'an as soon as possible

772
00:40:18,220 --> 00:40:19,340
and return to His Majesty.

773
00:40:19,740 --> 00:40:20,290
No.

774
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:22,270
I grew up with my aunt.

775
00:40:23,540 --> 00:40:24,940
My aunt is now in danger.

776
00:40:25,420 --> 00:40:26,800
I can't just leave like this.

777
00:40:28,060 --> 00:40:29,870
But now Luoyang is full of danger.

778
00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:32,140
You shouldn't take the risk here.

779
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:33,440
You don't have to persuade me.

780
00:40:33,750 --> 00:40:34,590
I've made up my mind.

781
00:40:34,810 --> 00:40:35,950
Although I can't officially

782
00:40:35,980 --> 00:40:36,980
supervise and urge Su Wumming to investigate the case,

783
00:40:37,470 --> 00:40:38,310
I will be much at ease

784
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:40,220
staying in Luoyang.

785
00:40:43,540 --> 00:40:44,180
Lu Tong,

786
00:40:44,430 --> 00:40:45,320
what do you mean?

787
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:48,300
The tree desires stillness but the wind will not cease.

788
00:40:49,050 --> 00:40:50,400
The princess won't sit and watch You Highness

789
00:40:50,430 --> 00:40:51,660
ascend the throne.

790
00:40:52,380 --> 00:40:53,420
But the fact that she was poisoned

791
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:54,860
is beneficial to you.

792
00:40:55,850 --> 00:40:57,000
You can ask Lu Lingfeng

793
00:40:57,210 --> 00:40:58,470
to pass a message to Su Wuming.

794
00:40:59,620 --> 00:41:02,530
And ask him to give up investigating the case secretly.

795
00:41:02,730 --> 00:41:03,240
Your Highness,

796
00:41:04,150 --> 00:41:06,720
those who achieve great things

797
00:41:07,410 --> 00:41:08,340
must move forward without distractions.

798
00:41:11,740 --> 00:41:12,500
Now the princess

799
00:41:12,850 --> 00:41:14,340
is currently staying in the Blessing Temple and won't come out.

800
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:16,090
I heard from Su Wuming

801
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:18,200
that she was poisoned by the Face Flower.

802
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:19,250
Besides,

803
00:41:20,370 --> 00:41:21,510
she has only a few days left.

804
00:41:23,260 --> 00:41:23,820
Your Highness,

805
00:41:24,430 --> 00:41:26,200
this is a great news.

806
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:28,110
The princess ordered Su Wuming by an informal official

807
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:29,460
to solve the case as soon as possible

808
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:30,120
and find the antidote.

809
00:41:31,180 --> 00:41:32,260
But I don't think

810
00:41:32,930 --> 00:41:34,060
this case is that easy.

811
00:41:34,450 --> 00:41:35,020
So...

812
00:41:39,170 --> 00:41:39,720
Your Highness.

813
00:41:40,660 --> 00:41:41,460
You won.

814
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:45,860
It's good to ascend the throne successfully.

815
00:41:47,420 --> 00:41:49,180
But if I disregard my family for this,

816
00:41:50,450 --> 00:41:51,690
it's not what I want.

817
00:41:55,060 --> 00:41:55,630
Lu Lingfeng.

818
00:41:56,460 --> 00:41:57,180
Go back to

819
00:41:57,220 --> 00:41:58,060
Su Wuming,

820
00:41:58,660 --> 00:42:00,630
and help him solve the case in full sail.

821
00:42:04,310 --> 00:42:05,030
Su Wuming.

822
00:42:05,260 --> 00:42:06,290
A Crown Prince like him.

823
00:42:07,260 --> 00:42:08,150
Should he

824
00:42:08,510 --> 00:42:09,670
be well deserved

825
00:42:09,690 --> 00:42:11,180
to be our new emperor!

826
00:42:13,820 --> 00:42:16,360
It's great luck for our Tang

827
00:42:16,740 --> 00:42:19,570
to have a Crown Prince with such a heart!
