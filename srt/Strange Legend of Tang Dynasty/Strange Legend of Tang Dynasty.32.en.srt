There are many classes in the Blessing Temple now.

that the building was resumed.

However, it stopped again when only half of the tower

As far as I know,

114
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:43,870
the magic show was banned

115

by Emperor Gaozong back then.

Yes.

117
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,200
That's because some magic tricks

118
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:49,820
are too dangerous and bloody.

119
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:52,300

The 33 floors above the ground

00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:23,900
Its design and construction

175
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:25,700
are both brilliant.

176
00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:28,320
To ensure that this tower is unparalleled,

177
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:30,610
His Majesty ordered Yuwen Mukai

178
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:33,670
to burn the blueprints.

179
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:35,780
In that case,

180
00:09:36,010 --> 00:09:37,810
no other countries will be able to replicate this masterpiece.

181
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:39,470
It was so wise a decision, Your Majesty.

182
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:42,460
If our plan succeeds,

183
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:46,720
everyone contributing to it will be invited here for celebration.

184
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:47,740
At that time,

185
00:09:47,890 --> 00:09:50,000
you'll definitely be one of them, Assistant Minister Pei.

186
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:53,480
His Majesty

187
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:55,970
thinks highly of you, Assistant Minister Pei.

188
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:57,800
Among all the officials,

189
00:09:58,060 --> 00:09:59,270
you are the first one

190
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:00,810
to come to the Beyond Heaven

191
00:10:00,830 --> 00:10:02,560
with His Majesty.

192
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:03,990
Your Majesty,

193
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:07,350
I feel so honored.

194
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:11,430
Assistant Minister Pei,

195
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:12,590
look.

196
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:24,120
It seems to be a bird.

197
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:25,410
No.

198
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:28,980
Its wings

199
00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:30,570
are different from a bird's.

200
00:10:32,050 --> 00:10:33,240
Is it a wooden bird?

201
00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:34,080
Your Majesty,

202
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,440
should the Imperial Guards

203
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:36,420
shoot it down?

204
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:40,130
Don't make a fuss.

205
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:41,680
Even if it's a wooden bird,

206
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:43,210
there's nothing to worry about.

207
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:45,600
Word has spread

208
00:10:45,830 --> 00:10:47,590
that I'll hold a magic show

209
00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:49,300
on the Mid-Autumn Festival.

210
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:52,740
I've heard that magicians from all over the world

211
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:54,760
are arriving in the capital one after another.

212
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,730
Maybe that

213
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:58,460
is some magician

214
00:10:58,720 --> 00:10:59,820
practicing.

[Government Office]

218
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:23,100
What happened?

219
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:25,950
A big bird just flew by.

220
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:27,420
It seemed to be made of wood.

221
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:28,660
Arrows were shot from it.

222
00:11:29,410 --> 00:11:29,940
Look.

223
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:34,460
[Sass]

224
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:42,260
Sass.

225
00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:45,500
He sneaked into Chang'an

226
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:46,640
under the pretext of attending the magic show

227
00:11:47,170 --> 00:11:49,880
and had the nerve to send a provoking letter by the wooden bird.

228
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:53,350
[Wan An, Minister of Justice of Yongzhou]

229
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:51,450
Is this Sass

230
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:53,030
the greatest magician ever

231
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:53,770
who has disappeared

232
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:55,960
for more than a decade?

233
00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:57,240
Yes.

234
00:11:58,780 --> 00:11:59,950
He's a magician,

235
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:01,410
and also a killer.

236
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:02,600
A killer?

237
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:04,690
He threatened to settle the score with the court.

238
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:06,670
What did he mean?

239
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:08,720
Settle the score with the court?

240
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,270
The court has been waiting for him.

241
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:14,760
The crimes he committed

242
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:17,610
have never been forgotten.

243
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:35,240
He's tall.

244
00:12:46,650 --> 00:12:47,130
Father.

245
00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:49,530
You've just been back for days.

246
00:12:50,090 --> 00:12:51,810
Instead of staying home,

247
00:12:52,390 --> 00:12:53,290
why did you go out?

248
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:55,230
I've been away from Chang'an for over a year.

249
00:12:55,730 --> 00:12:56,810
I want to see what's new.

250
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,100
That required you to dress up as a man?

251
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,110
That required you

252
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:03,300
to go to the camp of the Imperial Guards?

253
00:13:04,130 --> 00:13:04,810
Father,

254
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,290
you sent someone to follow me?

255
00:13:08,290 --> 00:13:08,980
Xijun,

256
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,130
come and have a seat.

257
00:13:18,410 --> 00:13:20,820
I held a nether marriage for you.

258
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:22,840
His Majesty has known about it.

259
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:25,230
His Majesty so benevolent

260
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:26,500
that he has forgiven me.

261
00:13:27,170 --> 00:13:28,490
You love Lu Lingfeng,

262
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:30,580
and followed him to Nanzhou.

263
00:13:31,070 --> 00:13:31,830
It's no news

264
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:33,380
in the capital now.

265
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:36,030
The court has been talking about it.

266
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:37,840
That's my personal affair.

267
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:39,130
You're my daughter.

268
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:40,650
Your personal affairs

269
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:42,360
will very likely be used against me.

270
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:43,530
As you know,

271
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:45,470
Lu Lingfeng is on the Crown Prince's side.

272
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:46,780
There are seven Prime Ministers

273
00:13:47,070 --> 00:13:48,120
in the court now.

274
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,400
At least four of them

275
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:50,800
have sided with the Princess.

276
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:53,970
Because of Lu Lingfeng,

277
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:55,600
they may stand against me.

278
00:13:57,590 --> 00:13:58,180
Well…

279
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:00,310
Besides,

280
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:03,570
you taking Su Wuming as your sworn brother

281
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:05,480
was a half-baked decision.

282
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:07,190
What's wrong with that?

283
00:14:07,330 --> 00:14:08,160
You have no idea

284
00:14:08,190 --> 00:14:09,470
of the consequences of it.

285
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:10,820
Su Wuming

286
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:12,980
has a special relationship with the Princess.

287
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:15,200
She promoted him to be the Administrator of Luozhou

288
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:17,980
without securing His Majesty's consent.

289
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:19,900
It has aroused a heated controversy

290
00:14:19,930 --> 00:14:21,100
in the court.

291
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:23,160
With him as your sworn brother,

292
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:24,900
how will those siding with the Crown Prince

293
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:26,500
think of me?

294
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:29,700
Father,

295
00:14:30,590 --> 00:14:31,780
you're afraid

296
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:33,940
of offending the Princess because of Lu Lingfeng

297
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:35,620
and also worry about antagonizing

298
00:14:35,930 --> 00:14:38,300
the Crown Prince because of Su Wuming?

299
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:40,540
Well...

300
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:42,460
People in the court

301
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:44,040
have sided either with the Crown Prince

302
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:45,730
or with the Princess.

303
00:14:46,830 --> 00:14:48,190
As the Assistant Minister of Personnel Administration,

304
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:49,420
I feel torn between them

305
00:14:50,130 --> 00:14:52,240
and have no way of please both sides.

306
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:54,800
Father,

307
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:57,790
if that's the case,

308
00:14:58,810 --> 00:14:59,860
why are you delighted?

309
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:00,710
I...

310
00:15:01,830 --> 00:15:02,740
Do I look delighted?

311
00:15:03,290 --> 00:15:04,080
Have you forgotten

312
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:05,860
that I've been learning drawing since young.

313
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:08,370
I'm very observant.

314
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:09,950
You're smiling.

315
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:11,170
That means you're delighted.

316
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:15,070
I'm delighted

317
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,970
because of something delightful.

318
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:18,560
I, Pei Jian,

319
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:19,520
has swore loyalty to the Emperor of Tang.

320
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:20,990
His Majesty

321
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:24,800
is putting more and more trust in me.

322
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:25,940
Xijun,

323
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:27,200
I know

324
00:15:27,530 --> 00:15:29,370
you went to see Lu Lingfeng today.

325
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:32,140
Are you sure he's back in Chang'an?

326
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,050
We left Luoyang together,

327
00:15:36,590 --> 00:15:37,710
but he said something urgent came up

328
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:39,190
and rode back first.

329
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:42,350
Although you came back

330
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:43,370
through the public road

331
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:44,420
which is not that dangerous,

332
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:46,390
he's the General

333
00:15:46,770 --> 00:15:47,590
and shouldn't have let you

334
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:48,810
come back to Chang'an alone.

335
00:15:49,150 --> 00:15:50,570
He should've stayed with you and protected you.

336
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:52,220
You are not going to see

337
00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:54,460
someone like him again.

338
00:15:55,010 --> 00:15:55,620
Father,

339
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:56,980
it's not like what you think.

340
00:15:57,210 --> 00:15:58,420
He entrusted me

341
00:15:58,450 --> 00:15:59,820
to the wife of the prefectural governor

342
00:15:59,970 --> 00:16:00,710
who was coming to Chang'an too before he left.

343
00:16:01,530 --> 00:16:02,410
That didn't make him any better.

344
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:04,420
After all,

345
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:05,910
I'm decades of years older than you.

346
00:16:07,190 --> 00:16:08,190
The court

347

353
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:21,390
okay?

Your Highness.

359

Lu Lingfeng,

360
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:50,080
how have you been

361
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:51,220
these days in Chang'an?

362
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:52,780
I feel refreshed.

363
00:16:53,210 --> 00:16:53,780
Good.

364
00:16:54,850 --> 00:16:55,820
I asked you to come back to Chang'an

365
00:16:56,410 --> 00:16:57,420
but didn't summon you immediately

366
00:16:57,730 --> 00:16:59,170
because I wanted you to have a good rest.

367
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:00,110
Next,

368
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:02,080
I have a very important task

369
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:02,870
for you.

370
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:03,990

00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:05,960
Your Highness.

372
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:08,700
I can't wait to hear about it.

373
00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:12,910
The completion celebration for the Sky-scraping Tower

374
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:14,680
will be held at the night of the Mid-Autumn Festival.

375
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,089
Have you heard about it?

376
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:17,619
Yes.

377
00:17:18,619 --> 00:17:19,730
I've also heard about the magic show.

378
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:21,470
Once I arrived in Chang'an,

379
00:17:21,770 --> 00:17:22,740
I noticed many weird people

380
00:17:22,770 --> 00:17:23,640
on the streets.

381
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:24,810
They were probably magicians

382
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:26,260
coming for

383
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:26,980
the magic show, right?

384
00:17:27,430 --> 00:17:28,030
Yes.

385
00:17:28,730 --> 00:17:29,380
Even

386
00:17:30,410 --> 00:17:31,930
the Tocharian man, Sass,

387
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:32,910
a magician and also a killer

388
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:34,960
who is renowned all over the country

389
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:36,890
has sneaked into Chang'an.

390
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:39,190
Sass?

391
00:17:40,650 --> 00:17:42,220
The deputy supervisor of the Concubinus Institution?

392
00:17:42,790 --> 00:17:43,750
The Concubinus Institution back then

393
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:45,560
was controlled by

394
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:46,580
Zhang Yizhi, Heavenly Empress's favorite male companion.

395
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:48,420
They established a branch

396
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:49,260
in the Magic House in Luoyang

397
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:51,560
and gathered a large group of enchanters

398
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:52,740
who were used

399
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:54,620
to eliminate their dissidents in the court.

400
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:56,910
The man leading them

401
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,370
was Sass.

402
00:17:59,390 --> 00:17:59,880
Your Highness,

403
00:18:00,650 --> 00:18:01,830
Su Wuming once told me

404
00:18:02,410 --> 00:18:03,690
that Di Renjie's adamant objection

405
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:05,720
forced Heavenly Empress to abolish the Concubinus Institution.

406
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:08,140
The Concubinus Institution became the Fengchen Institution.

407
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:10,030
It was just a change of the name.

408
00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:11,730
Su Wuming also said

409
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:14,890
that the Sass case

410
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,660
was the last case Detective Di was in charge of.

411
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:18,200
Right.

412
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:20,220
Sass was responsible

413
00:18:20,530 --> 00:18:21,610
for many deaths in and out of the court.

414
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:23,950
Detective Di risked provoking

415
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:24,940
Heavenly Empress

416
00:18:25,450 --> 00:18:26,580
and secretly arrested Sass

417
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:27,580
and his underlings.

418
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:31,080
Unfortunately, most of his underlings

419
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:32,440
were captured,

420
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:35,310
but Sass escaped from Luoyang.

421
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:40,030
Now, he openly

422
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:40,940
sent a letter by a wooden bird

423
00:18:40,970 --> 00:18:41,850
to challenge the court.

424
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:43,720
The Mid-Autumn Festival is approaching.

425
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:46,270
I don't want His Majesty and aunt

426
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:48,270
to be threatened by Sass.

427
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,830
I will definitely

428
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:53,140
bring Sass to justice

429
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:54,660
before the Mid-Autumn Festival.

430
00:18:56,110 --> 00:18:56,960
I'm sorry

431
00:18:57,650 --> 00:18:58,860
that I summoned you back to Chang'an

432
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,510
but can't give you a post immediately.

433
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:03,460
To avoid any mishap,

434
00:19:03,870 --> 00:19:04,950
you should keep

435
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:06,160
the arrest of Sass quiet.

436
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:07,350
You also have to

437
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:08,720
find assistance yourself.

438
00:19:09,390 --> 00:19:10,690
But Lu Tong

439
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:12,560
will help you in secret.

440
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:13,610
Understood.

441
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:18,310
Speaking of Sass,

442
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:20,000
about half a year ago,

443
00:19:20,570 --> 00:19:21,520
his biography

444
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:22,800
appeared in Chang'an.

445
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:25,040
Someone actually wrote a biography for him.

446
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:26,120
I found it unbelievable too.

447
00:19:26,730 --> 00:19:27,480
The author not only

448
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:29,070
wrote for the sinful killer,

449
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:30,740
but also mentioned

450
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:32,460
many things about Heavenly Empress in the biography.

451
00:19:32,850 --> 00:19:34,170
Therefore, it was banned before long

452
00:19:34,570 --> 00:19:35,640
and all its copies were destroyed.

453
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:38,680
There may be omitted ones.

454
00:19:39,570 --> 00:19:41,640
I suggest you look for this book

455
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:43,740
and see if there is any clue in it.

456
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:47,780

Yes.

Do you think this portrait resembles him?

495
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:27,880
In a way, yes.

496
00:21:28,930 --> 00:21:30,940
Where did you get this portrait?

497
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:32,720
Sass was once

the deputy supervisor of the Concubinus Institution.

499

Many people have met him.

500
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:37,290
I found about seven people

522
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:25,580
A distinguished guest lives upstairs.

523
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:26,230
He usually

524
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:27,270
covers his face with a scarf.

525
00:22:27,450 --> 00:22:28,170
But when I entered the room

526
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,030
to serve him,

527
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:29,980
I caught a glimpse of his face.

528
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:31,650
He looks quite like the man

529
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:32,780
in the portrait.

530
00:22:41,050 --> 00:22:41,610
This...

531
00:22:42,050 --> 00:22:42,640
This...

532
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:44,110
I don't know

533
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:45,320
he's a wanted criminal, officer.

534
00:22:45,510 --> 00:22:46,030
Guards.

535
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:48,700
Yes.

536
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:49,970
Dismiss our men by the gates.

537
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:52,060
Tell the rest to stop searching.

538
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,960
Hide around the inn.

539
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:56,860
We'll wait for him to show up.

540
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:57,480
Yes.

541
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:28,440
Is the person in the portrait you?

542
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:31,700
I know

543
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:32,980
you won't confess so easily.

544
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:34,440
Take him down!

545
00:23:57,460 --> 00:23:58,300
Don't let Sass get away!

546
00:23:58,430 --> 00:23:58,830
Chase him!

547
00:23:58,870 --> 00:23:59,390
Yes.

548
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:18,520
You are so fast.

549
00:24:18,770 --> 00:24:20,500
You're quite somebody, young man.

550
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:21,530
Sass.

551
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:23,580
You finally say something.

552
00:24:24,090 --> 00:24:25,610
Since you know I'm Sass,

553
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:27,780
aren't you afraid of death?

554
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:28,540
How dare you!

555
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:30,690
I am the Minister of Justice of Yongzhou.

556
00:24:31,230 --> 00:24:32,210
You have been a wanted criminal

557
00:24:32,230 --> 00:24:33,610
of the government for years.

558
00:24:34,490 --> 00:24:36,060
Surrender now.

559
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:15,180
Minister Wan.

560
00:25:17,890 --> 00:25:18,740
Minister Wan.

561
00:25:19,690 --> 00:25:20,730
Minister Wan.

562
00:25:21,790 --> 00:25:22,790
Minister Wan.

563
00:25:23,450 --> 00:25:24,600
Minister Wan.

564
00:25:25,180 --> 00:25:25,900
Lock the surroundings.

565
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:26,840
Yes.

566
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:28,380
Who is the dead?

567
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:30,380
Who are you?

568
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:33,550
The Imperial Guards are investigating the case. Tell me the truth.

569
00:25:34,530 --> 00:25:35,920
Minister Wan died.

570
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:37,710
Sass killed him.

571
00:25:38,650 --> 00:25:39,370
What?

572
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:44,270
What did you say?

573
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:45,420
Who killed him? Say it again.

574
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:47,660
We patrolled with Minister Wan today

575
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:48,960
to catch Sass.

576
00:25:49,210 --> 00:25:50,340
We blocked him

577
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:51,740
in the Seeking Inn just now.

578
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:52,670
But he used illusionary magic

579
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:53,510
to release many bats

580
00:25:53,550 --> 00:25:54,270
and ran away.

581
00:25:54,610 --> 00:25:55,770
Minister Wan took the lead to chase him.

582
00:25:56,020 --> 00:25:57,190
When we saw them,

583
00:25:57,220 --> 00:25:58,370
Minister Wan was...

584
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:05,240
-Go. -Don't catch me.

585
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:06,250
Don't catch me!

586
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:07,740
Don't catch me!

587
00:26:07,810 --> 00:26:09,240
-I didn't do anything. -Go.

588
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,080
What happened?

589
00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:11,130
General Lu.

590
00:26:11,350 --> 00:26:12,600
We found him in the corner over there.

591
00:26:12,970 --> 00:26:13,940
The corner over there?

592
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:19,910
Did you see

593
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:20,700
anything just now?

594
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:22,220
I...

595
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:23,240
I...

596
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:28,370
It's just a small trick.

597
00:26:30,030 --> 00:26:31,180
I know you know illusionary magic.

598
00:26:31,850 --> 00:26:33,180
You killed people with bats a moment ago.

599
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:34,870
Now you want to escape with tricks again.

600
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:36,540
Do you think I'm a kid?

601
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:46,480
Then?

602
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:47,380
Then,

603
00:26:48,290 --> 00:26:50,290
I was too scared to see

604
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:53,010
a dead person.

605
00:26:54,170 --> 00:26:54,810
Come here.

606
00:26:58,030 --> 00:26:58,840
Is this the person you saw?

607
00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:00,590
They look alike

608
00:27:01,770 --> 00:27:02,170
but

609
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:03,450
I'm not sure.

610
00:27:03,990 --> 00:27:04,630
I heard it was

611
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:05,830
what Sass looked like 12 years ago.

612
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:07,670
Maybe he looks older now.

613
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:09,330
It's not a matter of age.

614
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:11,860
I can't describe it.

615
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:14,540
Anyway,

616
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:15,460
they look alike

617
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:16,610
but

618
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:17,950
something is different.

619
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:25,210
[Pei's Residence]

620
00:27:44,810 --> 00:27:46,540
Who is there?

621
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:48,330
It's me, Lu Lingfeng.

622
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:53,090
Why are you here

623
00:27:53,110 --> 00:27:54,220
in the middle of the night?

624
00:27:54,710 --> 00:27:56,000
Aren't you afraid that my father will know?

625
00:27:56,190 --> 00:27:57,030
This is an emergency.

626
00:27:57,660 --> 00:27:58,810
Lu Lingfeng has a request.

627
00:28:04,890 --> 00:28:06,210
I have been looking for you for days.

628
00:28:06,250 --> 00:28:07,030
But I couldn't find you.

629
00:28:08,130 --> 00:28:09,680
I didn't expect you to come here alone.

630
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:10,900
Come in.

631
00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:12,630
This is inappropriate.

632
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:13,900
I'll say it here.

633
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:15,640
I want you to draw a portrait for me.

634
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:16,860
Whose portrait?

635
00:28:17,250 --> 00:28:18,160
Tonight,

636
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:20,570
Wan An, the Minister of Justice of Yongzhou,

637
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:21,810
was killed.

638
00:28:22,190 --> 00:28:24,540
The murderer is suspected to be

639
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:25,350
Sass, a Tocharian killer who uses illusionary magic.

640
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:26,950
But we're not sure yet.

641
00:28:27,310 --> 00:28:28,140
There is a witness.

642
00:28:28,330 --> 00:28:29,210
He is a little beggar.

643
00:28:29,810 --> 00:28:31,770
He's about the same age as Xue Huan.

644
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:33,940
I just don't know

645
00:28:33,970 --> 00:28:34,980
how to bring him to your residence.

646
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:38,050
That's easy.

647
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:39,460
Tomorrow,

648
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:41,090
take him to the East Market and sell him.

649
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:42,670
I'll buy him.

650
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:43,570
Great.

651
00:28:44,190 --> 00:28:44,870
I'll let Guo Zhuang

652
00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:45,970
take that beggar

653
00:28:46,290 --> 00:28:47,110
to the East Market and wait for you there.

654
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:49,370
This clue is very important to me.

655
00:28:49,610 --> 00:28:51,020
Sorry to bother you this late.

656
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:52,460
Goodbye.

657
00:28:57,620 --> 00:28:58,460
How arrogant!

658
00:28:58,830 --> 00:29:00,100
He's too arrogant!

659
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:02,250
Yes.

660
00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:03,930
Wan An

661
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:06,040
was well-versed in both literature and martial arts.

662
00:29:06,970 --> 00:29:10,100
Unexpectedly, he died in the hands of Sass.

663
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:12,770
We need a capable man now

664
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:14,690
to take over Wan An's work.

665
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:16,710
Assistant Minister Pei, you are right.

666
00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:18,380
That's why I came here

667
00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:19,420
this late.

668
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:20,660
Administrator Du.

669
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:22,910
Is there a suitable candidate

670
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:23,800
you can recommend?

671
00:29:24,350 --> 00:29:24,980
Not really.

672
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:28,120
But the Mid-Autumn Festival is coming.

673
00:29:28,540 --> 00:29:30,740
His Majesty is going to hold a magic show.

674
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:32,060
And Sass

675
00:29:32,250 --> 00:29:34,360
sent a letter by a wooden bird to provoke the imperial court.

676
00:29:34,910 --> 00:29:36,730
Now Chang'an needs talents.

677
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:38,840
Assistant Minister Pei.

678
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:41,380
Please find a talent who can help me.

679
00:29:43,410 --> 00:29:44,110
But

680
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:46,710
the Minister of Justice of Yongzhou

681
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:48,380
is a low but powerful position.

682
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:50,980
I'm afraid

683
00:29:51,930 --> 00:29:53,430
someone has been targeting this position.

684
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:56,580
[East Market]

685
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:08,370
Why do you

686
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:09,530
seem to be uneasy?

687
00:30:10,050 --> 00:30:10,520
What?

688
00:30:11,130 --> 00:30:12,380
Since you don't want to come with me,

689
00:30:12,610 --> 00:30:13,890
why did you stalk me secretly before?

690
00:30:14,970 --> 00:30:16,330
I was ordered by Assistant Minister Pei.

691
00:30:16,890 --> 00:30:17,710
I had no choice.

692
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:37,530

696
00:30:44,090 --> 00:30:45,340
During the trip to the south in the past year,

697
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:47,160
Xue Huan was always by my side.

698
00:30:48,250 --> 00:30:49,760
But this time he didn't come back to Chang'an.

699
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:51,240
I'm not used to it.

700
00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:53,380
Buy him for me

701
00:30:54,170 --> 00:30:55,260
so that you don't have to hang out with me.

702
00:30:55,490 --> 00:30:56,290
You'll be at ease.

703
00:30:56,710 --> 00:30:57,450
Yes, Miss.

704
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:01,310
That man is this tall

705
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:03,740
with beard on his face.

706
00:31:07,770 --> 00:31:08,770
He has

707
00:31:09,150 --> 00:31:10,440
a scar by his eyes

708
00:31:10,650 --> 00:31:11,730
about this long.

709
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:14,740
By the way,

710
00:31:15,350 --> 00:31:17,340
he has a hood on his head.

711
00:31:17,970 --> 00:31:19,270
His hair is also very long.

712
00:31:19,570 --> 00:31:21,490
He was facing the sky.

713
00:31:21,710 --> 00:31:22,610
He opened his mouth

714
00:31:23,170 --> 00:31:24,490
and his eyes were wide open.

715
00:31:24,730 --> 00:31:26,370
He looked terrified.

716
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:39,280
Please

717
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:40,940
put this matter in mind, Assistant Minister Pei.

718
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:43,120
I shall take my leave.

719
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:44,820
OK.

720
00:31:45,610 --> 00:31:48,520
With all due respect,

721
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:51,260
although Yongzhou covers the region of the capital,

722
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:53,810
the Minister of Justice of Yongzhou

723
00:31:53,970 --> 00:31:54,970
is just

724
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:56,740
a seventh-rank official.

725
00:31:57,060 --> 00:31:58,700
But Regimental Commander Wei

726
00:31:58,930 --> 00:32:00,130
serves as a fifth-rank official in the Princess' Palace.

727
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:03,300
Why do you want a seventh-rank official position?

728
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:04,880
This

729
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:06,660
is kind of unbelievable.

730
00:32:06,790 --> 00:32:08,570
This is Her Highness' idea.

731
00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:10,370
For the safety of the Tang Dynasty,

732
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:12,530
and for His Majesty and Her Highness,

733
00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:14,540
why can't I replace my fifth-rank official

734
00:32:15,780 --> 00:32:16,810
with a seventh-rank one?

735
00:32:19,190 --> 00:32:21,500
Regimental Commander Wei has a high moral integrity.

736
00:32:21,850 --> 00:32:23,270
I admire you.

737
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:24,700
Assistant Minister Pei, please take it seriously

738
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:26,510
and fulfill my wish as soon as possible.

739
00:32:48,130 --> 00:32:48,770
Assistant Minister Pei.

740
00:32:49,170 --> 00:32:50,410
Please excuse me for

741
00:32:50,570 --> 00:32:51,200
going straight to the main hall.

742
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:52,280
Mr. Bai.

743
00:32:52,630 --> 00:32:54,190
You look anxious.

744
00:32:54,570 --> 00:32:55,940
Is His Highness

745
00:32:55,970 --> 00:32:56,690
looking for me?

746
00:32:56,820 --> 00:32:59,500
I heard that Wan An, the Minister of Justice of Youngzhou,

747
00:32:59,990 --> 00:33:01,170
died last night.

748
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:02,750
Yes.

749
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:04,710
Rumor has it that

750
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:05,820
he was killed by Sass who sneaked into the capital.

751
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:09,530
His Highness was very worried.

752
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:13,010
After careful consideration,

753
00:33:13,510 --> 00:33:14,640
I have a recommendation

754
00:33:15,310 --> 00:33:17,540
for the position of the Minister of Justice.

755
00:33:17,810 --> 00:33:19,610
Please grant my wish.

756
00:33:20,330 --> 00:33:22,530
His Highness wants to recommend someone too?

757
00:33:22,570 --> 00:33:23,210
Too?

758
00:33:26,010 --> 00:33:28,080
Did Wei Fenghua come here just now

759
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:29,460
also for this?

760
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:31,160
No.

761
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:32,650
It's a long story.

762
00:33:34,270 --> 00:33:35,590
I wonder

763
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:37,250
who is recommended by His Highness?

764
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:39,180
Former General of the Imperial Guards,

765
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:40,340
Lu Lingfeng.

766
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:45,380
He really went back to Chang'an?

767
00:33:47,980 --> 00:33:48,420
What?

768
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:51,650
Assistant Minister Pei is close to General Lu?

769
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:54,490
That'll be easier.

770
00:33:55,260 --> 00:33:55,850
No.

771
00:33:58,300 --> 00:34:00,240
Both sides want the same position.

772
00:34:00,870 --> 00:34:01,830
It's really hard

773
00:34:02,030 --> 00:34:03,320
for me as the Assistant Minister of Personnel Administration.

774
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:06,020
I know you have worries.

775
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:06,820
That's right.

776
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:08,810
Her Highness is powerful now.

777
00:34:09,239 --> 00:34:10,440
Among the seven Prime Ministers,

778
00:34:10,790 --> 00:34:12,850
four are Her Highness' subordinates.

779
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:17,880
But as talents,

780
00:34:18,139 --> 00:34:20,570
we should be more visionary.

781
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,050
Anyway,

782
00:34:22,580 --> 00:34:24,650
as the Crown Prince,

783
00:34:25,239 --> 00:34:27,340
His Highness is the foundation of the country.

784
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:30,219
I hope you can think it through.

785
00:34:31,969 --> 00:34:32,630
Yes. Yes.

786
00:34:32,659 --> 00:34:33,130
Goodbye.

787
00:34:33,510 --> 00:34:34,179
Okay.

788
00:34:41,020 --> 00:34:41,860
This nose

789
00:34:43,370 --> 00:34:44,770
is too small.

790
00:34:45,139 --> 00:34:47,060
And the eyebrows are not thick enough.

791
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:48,300
The beard

792
00:34:48,969 --> 00:34:50,040
is not long enough.

793
00:34:53,250 --> 00:34:53,850
Xijun.

794
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:55,179
Are you drawing?

795
00:34:56,900 --> 00:34:57,820
Who is he?

796
00:34:58,220 --> 00:34:58,890
Where did you get him?

797
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:00,800
This is the new servant I bought today.

798
00:35:01,250 --> 00:35:02,280
I haven't taught him manners yet.

799
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:04,120
Leave.

800
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:12,530
Who are you drawing?

801
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:16,000
I heard

802
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:17,280
that Sass, who uses illusionary magic to kill people,

803
00:35:17,810 --> 00:35:19,220
assassinated Wan An, the Minister of Justice of Yonghzhou

804
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:20,930
in public last night.

805
00:35:21,570 --> 00:35:22,640
I want to draw

806
00:35:22,930 --> 00:35:24,160
his portrait according to my imagination.

807
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:25,510
By the way, Father.

808
00:35:26,170 --> 00:35:28,460
As Sass served as the deputy supervisor of the Concubinus Institution,

809
00:35:28,890 --> 00:35:29,820
you should know him.

810
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:31,670
Please have a look.

811
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:32,680
Does this look like him?

812
00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:36,500
Not really.

813
00:35:37,050 --> 00:35:38,450
Not at all?

814
00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:39,220
This

815
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:40,790
is just similar in appearance,

816
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:43,000
but totally different from him in reality.

817
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:44,030
Sass

818
00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:45,780
is a handsome Tocharian man.

819
00:35:46,180 --> 00:35:47,100
He's intelligent,

820
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:48,170
so his eyes

821
00:35:48,820 --> 00:35:49,940
are full of wisdom.

822
00:35:51,580 --> 00:35:52,140
Xijun.

823
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:53,720
Go inside.

824
00:35:54,340 --> 00:35:55,580
I have something to tell you.

825
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:58,290
Xijun.

826
00:35:59,170 --> 00:36:01,570
Chang'an is not safe now.

827
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:02,460
I think

828
00:36:02,630 --> 00:36:04,290
you must have the chance to meet Lu Lingfeng.

829
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:07,120
You have to persuade him to leave Chang'an as soon as possible.

830
00:36:07,610 --> 00:36:10,020
I know you only care about him.

831
00:36:10,060 --> 00:36:11,010
It's hard to let him go.

832
00:36:11,060 --> 00:36:11,500
But

833
00:36:11,740 --> 00:36:13,070
I can't let my daughter

834
00:36:13,090 --> 00:36:14,320
ruin her life.

835
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:16,140
Father, you mean

836
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:18,020
you won't grant the position of the Minister of Justice

837
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:19,510
to Lu Lingfeng?

838
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:21,510
Regimental Commander Wei from the Princess's Palace

839
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:22,610
is a fifth-rank official.

840
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:23,450
Now,

841
00:36:23,540 --> 00:36:25,470
he wants to have this seventh-rank official.

842
00:36:26,740 --> 00:36:28,420
Lu Lingfeng was the General of the Imperial Guards.

843
00:36:28,610 --> 00:36:29,580
He was a four-rank official.

844
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:31,240
Don't put it that way.

845
00:36:31,890 --> 00:36:33,240
Now the Crown Prince and Princess

846
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:34,800
are at odds.

847
00:36:35,210 --> 00:36:37,730
Chang'an will be in chaos at any time.

848
00:36:38,310 --> 00:36:40,430
Lu Lingfeng thinks he's a talent for the country,

849
00:36:40,650 --> 00:36:42,540
and is loyal to His Highness.

850
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:44,820
If he were granted

851
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:46,780
the position of the Minister of Justice of Yongzhou,

852
00:36:47,250 --> 00:36:49,240
he would be in the center of the chaos.

853
00:36:49,870 --> 00:36:52,430
Do you think I don't know that?

854
00:36:52,940 --> 00:36:54,380
Although His Highness is the Crown Prince,

855
00:36:54,820 --> 00:36:56,780
but in terms of the strength in the imperial court,

856
00:36:56,980 --> 00:36:57,870
he is much weaker

857
00:36:58,180 --> 00:36:59,910
than Her Highness.

858
00:37:01,730 --> 00:37:02,320
So,

859
00:37:02,860 --> 00:37:03,610
do you want to

860
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:05,080
grant the position of the Minister of Justice

861
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:06,530
to Wei Fenghua?

862
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:09,810
I'm not that stupid.

863
00:37:10,530 --> 00:37:12,760
I can't offend either side.

864
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:14,820
Father, you have a third choice?

865
00:37:15,810 --> 00:37:16,920
That will be a good idea.

866
00:37:17,660 --> 00:37:19,220
Administrator Du Ming of Yongzhou

867
00:37:19,580 --> 00:37:21,380
was once a minister of justice

868
00:37:21,570 --> 00:37:22,650
and served as Deputy President of the Supreme Court.

869
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:24,150
He is not only good at solving cases,

870
00:37:24,380 --> 00:37:25,980
but also skilled in martial arts.

871
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:28,020
When Detective Di was alive,

872
00:37:28,290 --> 00:37:29,940
he was praised as a talent.

873
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:31,610
I want him

874
00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:34,640
to be the acting Minister of Justice for the time being.

875
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:35,970
In this case,

876
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:37,580
both the Crown Prince and the Princess

877
00:37:38,180 --> 00:37:39,670
will have no grudge.

878
00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:42,250
Father is indeed experienced.

879
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,460
But this is not a good idea.

880
00:37:45,820 --> 00:37:46,620
Why not?

881
00:37:48,690 --> 00:37:49,550
The General Administrator of Yongzhou

882
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:51,660
is assumed by the prince.

883
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:52,910
Therefore,

884
00:37:53,490 --> 00:37:55,250
the Administrator is the chief.

885
00:37:57,050 --> 00:37:58,960
Now you let him

886
00:37:58,980 --> 00:38:00,120
hold the post of the Minister of Justice.

887
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:02,070
There has been no precedent in the imperial court.

888
00:38:02,590 --> 00:38:04,180
Besides, you lay all the burdens of Yongzhou,

889
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:05,480
big or small,

890
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:06,850
on Du Ming alone.

891
00:38:07,180 --> 00:38:08,220
Will it work?

892
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:11,740
What should I do then?

893
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:14,120
In my opinion,

894
00:38:14,550 --> 00:38:16,020
you can let Her Highness to decide.

895
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:19,090
Her Highness has chosen the candidate.

896
00:38:19,620 --> 00:38:21,020
There's nothing more to be decided.

897
00:38:21,380 --> 00:38:22,380
That's because

898
00:38:22,620 --> 00:38:23,840
Her Highness doesn't know that the Eastern Palace

899
00:38:23,870 --> 00:38:25,050
recommended Lu Lingfeng.

900
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:27,170
You may report it

901
00:38:27,220 --> 00:38:28,300
to Her Highness directly.

902
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:30,320
Maybe your trouble

903
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:31,620
will be solved.

904
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:32,830
What?

905
00:38:33,220 --> 00:38:34,100
What do you mean?

906
00:38:36,850 --> 00:38:37,330
Father.

907
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:40,120
Something happened in Dongdu

908
00:38:40,460 --> 00:38:41,500
that you don't know.

909
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:43,240
If you trust your daughter,

910
00:38:43,930 --> 00:38:45,240
just do as I say.

911
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:47,100
It will solve your problem.

912
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:55,690
The person recommended by the Eastern Palace is Lu Lingfeng.

913
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:57,260
Good.

914
00:38:57,850 --> 00:39:00,140
The imperial court is in need of talents now.

915
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:02,060
We do need someone like him.

916
00:39:02,620 --> 00:39:05,020
But it's a pity that this is a low-rank position.

917
00:39:05,390 --> 00:39:06,490
If he makes contributions,

918
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:08,710
don't forget to promote him, Assistant Minister Pei.

919
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:09,780
I understand.

920
00:39:10,540 --> 00:39:12,420
I'll take my leave.

921
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:15,000
I've seen

922
00:39:15,410 --> 00:39:16,210
your daughter.

923
00:39:18,260 --> 00:39:19,300
Not as beautiful as a goddess.

924
00:39:20,220 --> 00:39:22,200
But she looks intelligent.

925
00:39:22,540 --> 00:39:23,680
Otherwise,

926
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:25,830
she wouldn't have followed Lu Lingfeng all the way south.

927
00:39:26,770 --> 00:39:28,180
She has a good taste.

928
00:39:28,580 --> 00:39:29,300
Assistant Minister Pei.

929
00:39:29,780 --> 00:39:30,490
Congratulations.

930
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:33,300
The appointment of Lu Lingfeng

931
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:36,550
is beneficial to the government and also to your family.

932
00:39:38,620 --> 00:39:39,240
I...

933
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:41,220
You just recommend talents, regardless of relatives.

934
00:39:41,890 --> 00:39:43,410
I don't mean to blame you.

935
00:39:44,530 --> 00:39:45,310
You may take your leave.

936
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:46,800
See you.

937
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:50,140
I'll take my leave.

938
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:51,340
Your Highness.

939
00:39:51,970 --> 00:39:53,900
Although Lu Lingfeng made contributions in Dongdu,

940
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:55,870
he works for His Highness.

941
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:58,360
The Minister of Justice is a low-rank official,

942
00:39:58,650 --> 00:39:59,850
but is very important.

943
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:01,850
At this moment,

944
00:40:01,870 --> 00:40:03,680
you grant this position to someone on the other side...

945
00:40:03,790 --> 00:40:05,370
Lu Lingfeng is not on the other side.

946
00:40:07,110 --> 00:40:08,480
It's settled.

947
00:40:09,020 --> 00:40:09,680
And you don't need to

948
00:40:09,710 --> 00:40:11,660
condescend yourself to a seventh-rank official.

949
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:13,060
Isn't that good?

950
00:40:13,940 --> 00:40:14,380
Well,

951
00:40:15,430 --> 00:40:16,550
I'll listen to Your Highness.

952
00:40:17,670 --> 00:40:20,210
That Sass is really somebody.

953
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:22,190
He killed Wan An

954
00:40:22,210 --> 00:40:23,380
within few days after he came.

955
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:26,220
Although Sass is a mysterious man,

956
00:40:26,630 --> 00:40:28,710
I found where he lived

957
00:40:29,130 --> 00:40:31,310
before Wan An.

958
00:40:31,850 --> 00:40:32,520
Really?

959
00:40:34,190 --> 00:40:35,710
What did he say

960
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:37,890
about your plan?

961
00:40:42,070 --> 00:40:43,350
Since you've found me,

962
00:40:44,620 --> 00:40:46,430
you're not an ordinary person, are you?

963
00:40:47,170 --> 00:40:48,060
It doesn't matter.

964
00:40:48,820 --> 00:40:50,340
I just wonder whether you dare to do

965
00:40:50,850 --> 00:40:52,210
what I told you or not.

966
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:54,440
To kill the Crown Prince.

967
00:40:55,100 --> 00:40:55,660
This...

968
00:40:57,580 --> 00:40:59,380
It's not typical of you to hesitate like this.

969
00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:00,980
I heard that you killed

970
00:41:01,060 --> 00:41:02,500
many people in Luoyang back then.

971
00:41:02,970 --> 00:41:04,320
The opposition of Empress Wu Zetian

972
00:41:05,020 --> 00:41:06,330
were all big shots.

973
00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:08,900
But he is the head of the Eastern Palace after all.

974
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:11,630
He is different from those officials.

975
00:41:12,570 --> 00:41:14,200
Shouldn't you tell me

976
00:41:14,820 --> 00:41:15,910
who you are?

977
00:41:15,980 --> 00:41:16,430
I don't think

978
00:41:16,460 --> 00:41:17,940
you need to know who I am.

979
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:19,220
You just need to know

980
00:41:19,650 --> 00:41:20,530
that after this is done,

981
00:41:21,410 --> 00:41:22,780
you can get

982
00:41:23,340 --> 00:41:24,610
whatever you want.

983
00:41:27,220 --> 00:41:27,820
I still need

984
00:41:29,540 --> 00:41:30,330
to think about it

985
00:41:30,330 --> 00:41:31,500
carefully.

986
00:41:31,860 --> 00:41:33,020
You have three days.

987
00:41:33,490 --> 00:41:34,340
On the seventh day of August,

988
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:36,120
I'll wait for your reply

989
00:41:36,990 --> 00:41:38,270
in the Spring Field Inn of Pingkang Fang.

990
00:41:40,610 --> 00:41:41,770
I saw he was interested in it.

991
00:41:42,170 --> 00:41:43,130
It should be fine.

992
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:45,930
But I planned this

993
00:41:45,950 --> 00:41:47,400
a few months ago.

994
00:41:48,620 --> 00:41:49,690
And now, I've gone through

995
00:41:49,730 --> 00:41:51,330
the danger of the Face Flower.

996
00:41:51,910 --> 00:41:54,030
It doesn't seem to be a good timing

997
00:41:56,010 --> 00:41:57,480
to kill the Crown Prince.

998
00:41:59,030 --> 00:42:00,400
It is immoral, or even cruel.

999
00:42:00,690 --> 00:42:01,060
Your Highness.

1000
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:02,280
You should cut it off

1001
00:42:02,340 --> 00:42:03,630
or you will suffer the chaos.

1002
00:42:03,780 --> 00:42:05,300
If you want to be the second Heavenly Empress

1003
00:42:05,410 --> 00:42:06,820
and restore the Tang Dynasty,

1004
00:42:06,970 --> 00:42:08,290
you must not hesitate

1005
00:42:08,330 --> 00:42:09,430
at this crucial moment.

1006
00:42:09,470 --> 00:42:10,070
Otherwise,

1007
00:42:10,490 --> 00:42:11,900
you'll regret it.

1008
00:42:13,940 --> 00:42:16,240
But the Crown Prince has been close to me

1009
00:42:16,260 --> 00:42:17,510
since his childhood.

1010
00:42:18,180 --> 00:42:19,230
This time in Luoyang,

1011
00:42:19,380 --> 00:42:21,110
he tried his best to save me.

1012
00:42:21,210 --> 00:42:22,480
So what?

1013
00:42:22,810 --> 00:42:23,990
The Crown Prince's performance in Dongdu

1014
00:42:24,020 --> 00:42:25,380
might be an illusion.

1015
00:42:25,620 --> 00:42:26,860
Although he's showing kindness,

1016
00:42:26,970 --> 00:42:28,640
I'm afraid he's trying to retreat in order to better advance.

1017
00:42:28,850 --> 00:42:30,350
Once there is a chance,

1018
00:42:30,380 --> 00:42:31,760
he will definitely do something

1019
00:42:31,790 --> 00:42:32,590
to harm Your Highness.

1020
00:42:32,740 --> 00:42:34,280
Even for my own safety,

1021
00:42:34,420 --> 00:42:35,780
I can't let Your Highness

1022
00:42:35,890 --> 00:42:36,820
miss the opportunity

1023
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:39,250
and be doomed.

1024
00:42:42,470 --> 00:42:45,350
For your own safety? Seriously?

1025
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:49,300
I'm telling the truth from the bottom of my heart.

1026
00:42:49,850 --> 00:42:50,960
If the Crown Prince ascends the throne,

1027
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:52,890
I, as a trusted follower of Your Highness,

1028
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:55,360
would be expelled from the capital

1029
00:42:55,620 --> 00:42:56,960
and demoted to a barbarian place.

1030
00:42:57,520 --> 00:43:00,520
What's worse, I may die an ignominious death.

1031
00:43:01,900 --> 00:43:03,870
You were raised

1032
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:04,940
by your uncle, right?

1033
00:43:20,450 --> 00:43:24,560
♫The storm rises with no reason♫

1034
00:43:25,260 --> 00:43:27,640
♫In the night of illusions♫

1035
00:43:29,420 --> 00:43:31,010
♫I go into the maze♫

1036
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:37,900
♫In a world of prosperity♫

1037
00:43:39,050 --> 00:43:41,080
♫A heart burns with obsession♫

1038
00:43:42,100 --> 00:43:44,050
♫With the darkness rising♫

1039
00:43:45,410 --> 00:43:51,070
♫I can't stop wandering through the night♫

1040
00:43:51,910 --> 00:43:58,100
♫With light in my heart, I'm not afraid of the storm♫

1041
00:43:58,430 --> 00:44:02,140
♫It's because of justice♫

1042
00:44:04,890 --> 00:44:10,760
♫That I seek a truth for this long, lonely night♫

1043
00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:17,390
♫The heaven and earth are held together by a strong will♫

1044
00:44:18,370 --> 00:44:20,150
♫The people are in peace♫

1045
00:44:20,380 --> 00:44:24,540
♫Carving right and wrong into a clear heart♫

1046
00:44:24,970 --> 00:44:26,190
♫The truth♫

1047
00:44:26,820 --> 00:44:29,880
♫Will reinterpret this justice♫

1048
00:44:31,740 --> 00:44:36,030
♫Even if there is fog♫

1049
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:39,040
♫Even if there are invisible waves♫

1050
00:44:40,620 --> 00:44:42,620
♫I'll tell the story of the fate♫

1051
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:49,160
♫Tell the love of the world♫

1052
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:52,640
♫For the memory of grace♫

1053
00:44:53,570 --> 00:44:55,930
♫And the resentment is not yet over♫

1054
00:44:56,880 --> 00:45:02,320
♫The rivers and mountains are immortal, the clouds are overturned♫

1055
00:45:03,290 --> 00:45:09,480
♫To be consoled by the truth, even with thorns on my back♫

1056
00:45:09,810 --> 00:45:14,210
♫Only for justice♫

1057
00:45:16,190 --> 00:45:22,470
♫That I seek a truth for this long, lonely night♫

1058
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:28,600
♫The heaven and earth are held together by a strong will♫

1059
00:45:29,710 --> 00:45:31,770
♫The people are in peace♫

1060
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:36,240
♫Carving right and wrong into a clear heart♫

1061
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:38,290
♫The truth♫

1062
00:45:38,330 --> 00:45:42,050
♫Will reinterpret this justice♫

1063
00:45:42,290 --> 00:45:48,390
♫Even if there are a thousand sails, it's not a waste of time♫

1064
00:45:48,750 --> 00:45:54,940
♫What I am afraid of is the unrighted wrong♫

1065
00:45:55,550 --> 00:45:57,470
♫What is the meaning of life and death?♫

1066
00:45:57,750 --> 00:46:01,890
♫I'll paint the sunshine into the landscape♫

1067
00:46:02,150 --> 00:46:03,860
♫The spirit of righteousness♫

1068
00:46:04,010 --> 00:46:07,990
♫Exists for the one I care♫
