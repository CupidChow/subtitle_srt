5
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:50,580
Come.

6
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:52,100
Please.

7
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:53,979
What an achievement.

8
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:56,420
Congratulations.

9
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:04,460
It's so lively.

10
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:07,780
It seems that the host of the banquet

11
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:09,340
is a big name in Nanzhou.

12
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:10,949
He indeed is.

13
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,680
You're his servant?

14
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:14,810
Yes.

15
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:18,140
He was born a master.

16
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:20,530
I was born a servant.

17
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:22,240
Both of his sons

18
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:23,590
passed the exam to become the Imperial Scholars.

19
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:24,890
I...

20
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:27,820
I'm happy for him.

21
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:32,350
Sir,

22
00:02:33,329 --> 00:02:34,310
are you drunk?

23
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:36,880
So what?

24
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:38,320
I'm still rowing the boat

25
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:39,220
as steadily as ever.

26
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:40,410
After ferrying you,

27
00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:42,450
I'm going to pick up

28
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:44,410
his two sons.

29
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:45,850
The distinguished guests are here.

30
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:48,170
Please.

31
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:50,550
Prefectural Governor Xiong, Administrator Luo.

32
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:52,100
Commander Su,

33
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:55,470
although Master Xie is not one of Nanzhou Four Scholars,

34
00:02:55,890 --> 00:02:56,910
he is the most renowned

35
00:02:57,170 --> 00:02:58,990
in this city.

36
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:00,050
His two sons

37
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:01,890
are both qualified as Imperial Scholars,

38
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:03,000
which brings great honor

39
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:04,990
to the entire Nanzhou.

40
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:06,770
Congratulations.

41
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:08,570
Thank you.

42
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:10,060
Master Xie,

43
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:13,800
Commander Su is very capable in the capital.

44
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:16,510
His sworn sister

45
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:19,350
is the daughter of Assistant Minister Pei of the Ministry of Personnel Administration.

46
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:21,920
Commander Su,

47
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:22,940
Miss Pei.

48
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:27,130
Please take care of my sons in the future.

49
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:29,400
One of them is named Xie Ming,

50
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,900
the other one is Xie Hui.

51
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:32,780
Commander Su,

52
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:33,610
please.

53
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:34,220
Let's go in.

54
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:41,310
Minister Lu.

55
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:43,620
Headman Xie.

56
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:45,180
What are you doing here?

57
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:47,010
Master Xie is my uncle.

58
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:49,760
Your surname is Xie too.

59
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:50,660
Please.

60
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:51,340
Please.

61
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:53,190
The two young masters are here!

62
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:54,800
They're here.

63
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:55,850
They are amazing.

64
00:03:55,890 --> 00:03:58,010
They are very fortunate.

65
00:03:58,030 --> 00:03:58,740
Yeah.

66
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:01,780
They're coming this way.

67
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:03,920
The two on the boat are my sons.

68
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:08,430
It's so enviable.

69
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:12,320
Those two young men look like…

70
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:38,350
Help!

71
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:39,890
Help them!

72
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:41,940
Somebody help!

73
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:43,920
Help!

74
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:45,360
Help!

75
00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:47,409
Help me!

76
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:50,080
Help!

77
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:52,560
Please help!

78
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:24,760
Ming.

79
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:28,840
Hui.

80
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:31,670
How can I live

81
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:36,110
without both of you?

82
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,270
The murderer ferried us here.

83
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:46,780
He claimed to be the servant

84
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:48,460
of this family, didn't he?

85
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,840
He is my uncle's old servant.

86
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,180
It turns out that he never got over what happened back then.

87
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,050
How could he do this?

88
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:56,150
Shut up!

89
00:05:56,630 --> 00:05:57,480
Uncle.

90
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:13,180
Xie.

91
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,160
Do you know why you‘re here?

92
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:17,040
Yes.

93
00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:18,500
Then cut to the chase.

94
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:21,290
That old servant and Master Xie were on bad terms?

95
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:22,390
Tell me the details.

96
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:25,560
Uncle is nice to me,

97
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:26,750
I'm not supposed

98
00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:28,280
to speak ill of him.

99
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:30,600
But he was indeed at fault

100
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:33,670
in that incident.

101
00:06:34,570 --> 00:06:35,960
That old servant's son

102
00:06:36,659 --> 00:06:38,300
was the same age as Xie Ming and Xie Hui.

103
00:06:38,909 --> 00:06:39,490
Therefore,

104
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:41,659
he'd been serving them since very young.

105
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:42,850
That day

106
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:44,690
was the birthday of my two cousins.

107
00:06:44,890 --> 00:06:46,040
They insisted on going for a boat ride on the lake,

108
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:48,320
and my uncle agreed.

109
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:49,820
It was sunny at first,

110
00:06:50,170 --> 00:06:52,010
but the sky clouded up suddenly.

111
00:06:57,190 --> 00:06:58,220
Hold on tight!

112
00:06:59,380 --> 00:06:59,940
Dad!

113
00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:01,250
Hold on to something!

114
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:02,580
Watch out!

115
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:04,980
Hold on tight!

116
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:06,380
Xie Ming!

117
00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:07,530
Hold on tight!

118
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:08,310
Young Master!

119
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:09,190
Xie Ming!

120
00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:10,050
-Young Master! -Xie Ming!

121
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:10,750
Young Master!

122
00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:11,630
Xie Ming.

123
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:13,190
-What should we do now?  -Xie Ming.

124
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:13,910
Young Master!

125
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,390
-Save him! -Young Master!

126
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:17,830
Go save him, can you?

127
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:18,940
Save him!

128
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,470
Go save him!

129
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:22,150
Son!

130
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:23,340
Xie Ming!

131
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:24,210
Be careful, son!

132
00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:25,030
Watch out!

133
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:26,010
Come back!

134
00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:27,170
-Xie Ming! -Hurry up!

135
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:28,290
Hurry up!

136
00:07:28,530 --> 00:07:29,280
Come on!

137
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:30,470
Hurry up, son!

138
00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:31,290
Hurry up!

139
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:33,540
Young Master, are you alright?

140
00:07:33,810 --> 00:07:35,270
Son, swim back now!

141
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:36,370
-My son is fine. -Son!

142
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,520
My son is fine.

143
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:39,000
The storm is too strong.

144
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:40,880
Go back to the shore!

145
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:42,350
Son, swim back now!

146
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:43,220
Master,

147
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,630
my son is still in the water!

148
00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:45,590
We can't leave now!

149
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:47,100
Hurry, go back to the shore!

150
00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:48,170
The raging storm

151
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,680
may upset the boat any second!

152
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:50,460
Son!

153
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:54,790
It was very windy on the lake that time.

154
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:56,550
They had to go back to the shore immediately

155
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,080
or the boat might be knocked over.

156
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:00,620
But…

157
00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:02,600
My uncle decision

158
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,520
was indeed kind of selfish.

159
00:08:06,130 --> 00:08:07,750
That old servant's son

160
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:09,950
drowned?

161
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:10,900
Yeah.

162
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:12,560
That old servant nearly drowned too.

163
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:13,870
He was lucky.

164
00:08:14,230 --> 00:08:15,060
He was sent to the shore by the waves.

165
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:16,310
His son's body was not found

166
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:17,660
until three days later.

167
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:19,740
That old servant was quite a character.

168
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:21,940
After his son died,

169
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:23,430
he didn't seek revenge immediately.

170
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:26,880
He waited for more than ten years

171
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:28,730
to get back at

172
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:30,180
the Xie brothers

173
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:31,750
when they are qualified as Imperial Scholars.

174
00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:37,440
It's too cruel.

175
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:39,659
Headman Xie,

176
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:41,000
I want to ask you something.

177
00:08:41,299 --> 00:08:42,610
Are Xie Ming and Xie Hui

178
00:08:43,530 --> 00:08:44,570
in the painting of the Stone Bridge?

179
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:45,770
What?

180
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:47,590
The painting of the Stone Bridge?

181
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:51,500
Looks like he doesn't know about this.

182
00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:52,530
Xijun,

183
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:54,520
have you found something?

184
00:08:54,830 --> 00:08:56,960
The painting was drawn

185
00:08:56,990 --> 00:08:58,380
by Zhang Xuan 15 years ago.

186
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:00,570
The two kids playing chess in the painting

187
00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:01,360
should be

188
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:02,550
the Xie brothers.

189
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:03,530
Besides,

190
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,590
even though the servant in the painting has his back to the viewers,

191
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:07,140
but judging from his shape,

192
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,360
he should be the old servant tonight.

193
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:12,020
The two kids playing chess in the painting

194
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:13,190
are Xie Ming and Xie Hui?

195
00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:15,210
Miss Pei, do you have any proof?

196
00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:16,410
Don't make

197
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:17,950
wild guesses at such a serious case.

198
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,240
It's not a wild guess.

199
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:22,080
It's just that

200
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:23,900
Zhang Xuan was so good as a painter.

201
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:24,920
He managed to

202
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:25,920
portray the traits of the figures in the painting.

203
00:09:26,410 --> 00:09:27,780
So, although the brothers had grown up,

204
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:29,640
it's not hard to recognize them.

205
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:31,370
When I laid my eyes on the two Imperial Scholars

206
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:33,150
on the island today,

207
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:34,890
I found them familiar immediately.

208
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:37,250
Later, when I looked at their bodies close,

209
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:39,020
I knew I was right.

210
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:42,980
If Xijun was right,

211
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:47,420
Nanzhou Four Scholars

212
00:09:47,650 --> 00:09:50,130
are not the only people who died and would die.

213
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:53,970
Everyone

214
00:09:55,510 --> 00:09:56,720
in the painting of the Stone Bridge is doomed.

215
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:01,980
Su Wuming,

216
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:03,540
stop making unsupported speculations

217
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:04,290
with your sworn sister.

218
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:06,380
No matter what,

219
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:08,340
tomorrow morning,

220
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:11,000
I'll go meet Master Xie in person.

221
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:14,220
Miss Pei,

222
00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:16,200
I know you're good at painting,

223
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:17,900
but I don't believe

224
00:10:17,930 --> 00:10:18,850
you're that observant.

225
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:20,060
If you are wrong,

226
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:22,140
please don't meddle in

227
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:23,390
our investigations again.

228
00:10:24,170 --> 00:10:25,370
But if what you said

229
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:26,210
is proven right,

230
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:28,590
that'll be the key to crack this case.

231
00:10:29,290 --> 00:10:31,570
I'll owe you a deep debt of gratitude.

232
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:37,070
Master Xie, I'm sorry for your loss.

233
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:39,920
Sir,

234
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:43,170
your two sons just passed away.

235
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:45,140
I shouldn't have disturb you at this time,

236
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,800
but it's my duty

237
00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:48,610
to look into criminal cases.

238
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:49,970
I have to

239
00:10:50,970 --> 00:10:52,370
ask you some questions.

240
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:54,680
My grief now

241
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,880
is already beyond measure,

242
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:03,320
things can't get any worse.

243
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:04,500
Whatever you want to ask me about,

244
00:11:05,810 --> 00:11:07,420
just go ahead.

245
00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:09,730
Are the two kids

246
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:10,880
in the painting of the Stone Bridge

247
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:12,590
your two sons?

248
00:11:20,390 --> 00:11:21,740
Yes.

249
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,810
They are Xie Ming and Xie Hui.

250
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,330
I'm all ears.

251
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:39,960
Back then,

252
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:44,040
when Zhang Xuan travelled to Nanzhou,

253
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:45,860
he was down and out.

254
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:48,410
He stayed at my house.

255
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:51,950
It was my two sons who took him

256
00:11:52,390 --> 00:11:54,370
to the Nanzhou Four Scholars.

257
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,910
Is the man facing backwards

258
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,120
the old servant

259
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:03,020
who murdered your sons that day?

260
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:07,110
Yes.

261
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:08,980
His son

262
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:10,810
drowned

263
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,160
in an attempt for saving my son.

264
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:14,500
I've been guilty since then.

265
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:16,810
I gave him a lot of money

266
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:19,710
and thought he had let it go.

267
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:22,660
I never imagined he would exact revenge

268
00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:25,080
after all these years.

269
00:12:26,890 --> 00:12:30,140
My poor sons!

270
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:48,400
I know what you're thinking.

271
00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:49,230
I'm a man of my word.

272
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:50,500
I don't need you to remind me.

273
00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:11,580
I borrowed the painting of the Stone Bridge again.

274
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:13,070
Let's take a close look at it.

275
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:18,730
This painting is evil.

276
00:13:19,530 --> 00:13:20,980
It was nice

277
00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:21,990
to live in Nanzhou

278
00:13:22,210 --> 00:13:23,570
until all of a sudden,

279
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:25,590
this case became even creepier

280
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:26,770
than the Chang'an black tea case.

281
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,620
I've drank too much yesterday,

282
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:30,490
the hangover is killing me.

283
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:31,750
I'll leave the scrutinize of the painting to you.

284
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:34,140
There's someone hidden here.

285
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:35,680
Where?

286
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:36,770
Where?

287
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:39,670
On the branch.

288
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:43,960
There's a woodcutter lying between the branches.

289
00:13:44,450 --> 00:13:45,620
His face is blurry,

290
00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:47,430
but given his shape,

291
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,300
he was a young man when the painting was drawn.

292
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:52,740
He should be in his mid thirties now.

293
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:56,530
Lu Lingfeng,

294
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:58,940
now that you're not the acting minister anymore,

295
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:01,170
but Headman Xie and Headman Huang…

296
00:14:01,190 --> 00:14:02,140
They're still at my service.

297
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:03,080
Leave it to me.

298
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:09,790
Who on earth is the one

299
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:11,770
intending to kill everyone in this painting?

300
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:14,150
I think we should

301
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:15,130
stay away from it.

302
00:14:15,890 --> 00:14:17,570
Maybe this painting

303
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:19,270
was cursed by someone powerful.

304
00:14:19,770 --> 00:14:21,050
I'm leaving.

305
00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:24,950
Brother,

306
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:27,270
we seem to have missed something.

307
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:33,650
The first victim,

308
00:14:33,770 --> 00:14:34,550
Yan Yuanfu.

309
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,600
You mean,

310
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:41,580
Yan Yuanfu came back as a ghost and

311
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:42,910
killed those people?

312
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:45,650
In this world,

313
00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:48,710
there are neither gods nor ghosts.

314
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52,280
They are just

315
00:14:53,570 --> 00:14:54,140
humans in disguise.

316
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:00,800
Here we are.

317
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:03,970
Mr. Ma.

318
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:05,130
Mr. Ma.

319
00:15:06,930 --> 00:15:07,440
Where is he?

320
00:15:08,970 --> 00:15:10,430
He must have gone to collect firewood.

321
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:12,140
Are you sure the owner of this hut

322
00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:13,960
is the woodcutter in the painting?

323
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:14,910
Yeah.

324
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:16,560
He's been bragging about appearing

325
00:15:16,930 --> 00:15:17,890
in that painting all the time.

326
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:18,570
He also said

327
00:15:18,810 --> 00:15:20,530
it's a pity that his face isn't clearly shown.

328
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:22,250
Great.

329
00:15:22,890 --> 00:15:24,340
We've done a great job this time.

330
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:51,250
Mr. Ma,

331
00:15:51,710 --> 00:15:52,860
these officers are here for you.

332
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:54,170
You're so lucky

333
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:54,910
to be in that painting.

334
00:15:55,090 --> 00:15:56,330
They are bring you back to

335
00:15:56,370 --> 00:15:57,050
let you live in comfort.

336
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:00,240
Damn.

337
00:16:24,090 --> 00:16:25,100
Sorry, Commander Su.

338
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:26,640
We were too late.

339
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:28,330
That cliff is too high.

340
00:16:28,490 --> 00:16:29,490
To find the body,

341
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:30,390
it will take at least three to five days,

342
00:16:30,410 --> 00:16:31,170
half a month at most.

343
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:32,930
Besides, there are many beasts in that mountain.

344
00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:33,510
I'm afraid...

345
00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:36,710
Lu Lingfeng,

346
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,850
we need to visit the prefectural governor.

347
00:16:40,710 --> 00:16:41,200
I know

348
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:42,400
you think that Yan Yuanfu's death is suspicious,

349
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:44,300
but he was already buried days ago.

350
00:16:49,070 --> 00:16:49,700
That's why

351
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:51,660
we must get

352
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:53,140
the approval of Prefectural Governor Xiong.

353
00:16:54,290 --> 00:16:55,160
What?

354
00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:58,540
You want to dig Yan Yuanfu out?

355
00:16:59,120 --> 00:16:59,750
Yes.

356
00:16:59,930 --> 00:17:01,220
You can't find the murderer,

357
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:02,300
and think identifying Yan Yuanfu

358
00:17:02,330 --> 00:17:03,470
as another victim can help with that?

359
00:17:03,530 --> 00:17:05,480
The people in the painting of the Stone Bridge

360
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:07,020
died unnaturally one after another.

361
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:07,609
Therefore,

362
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:10,819
I suspect that Yan Yuanfu was murdered too.

363
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:12,390
Commander Su,

364
00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:13,819
Yan Yuanfu

365
00:17:13,849 --> 00:17:15,380
was buried days ago.

366
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:16,869
If I allow you to dig his grave,

367
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:18,520
how am I going to

368
00:17:18,550 --> 00:17:21,109
face his family?

369
00:17:21,569 --> 00:17:23,099
Only after revealing the truth

370
00:17:23,130 --> 00:17:24,290
and bringing the murderer to justice

371
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:26,589
can the deceased rest in peace.

372
00:17:26,619 --> 00:17:28,780
We owe that to his family.

373
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:30,180
You hit

374
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:31,500
a dead end in this case

375
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:32,750
and have no idea

376
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:33,740
where to find the next clue.

377
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,090
So you think

378
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,210
you can find something from

379
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:36,780
Yan Yuanfu's body?

380
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:40,050
Yeah. You can say that.

381
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:42,170
Not all murderers

382
00:17:42,170 --> 00:17:43,520
can be brought to justice.

383
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:45,830
Even your teacher Detective Di

384
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:47,880
who have solved countless mysterious cases in his life,

385
00:17:48,330 --> 00:17:49,250
couldn't say

386
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:51,750
that he had no regrets at all!

387
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:53,220
Detective Di taught me

388
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:55,700
that I must not miss out on

389
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:57,950
any chance of finding clues.

390
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:00,710
Have you considered the consequences

391
00:18:01,130 --> 00:18:03,050
of digging out the body

392
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:04,090
but finding no trace of murder at all?

393
00:18:04,330 --> 00:18:06,200
I'll accept any punishments.

394
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:10,150
Do you think I dare to punish you?

395
00:18:10,550 --> 00:18:12,560
You're under the wings of Her Highness!

396
00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:14,270
I'm not.

397
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:15,890
On the contrary,

398
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:18,200
I was expelled from the capital

399
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:20,730
because I offended Her Highness.

400
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:23,210
Anyway, that has nothing to do

401
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:24,850
with what we're talking about now.

402
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:27,190
The number of victims keeps increasing

403
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:29,020
and the murderer is still at large.

404
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:32,070
As an official, I should

405
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:34,300
catch the murderer as soon as possible

406
00:18:34,490 --> 00:18:36,350
and bring peace back to Nanzhou.

407
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:38,700
That's eloquent.

408
00:18:43,010 --> 00:18:45,180
What if I don't agree?

409
00:18:48,050 --> 00:18:49,520
You should be worth your salt.

410
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:52,070
If you can't do that, you're a coward

411
00:18:52,770 --> 00:18:53,540
who fails in your duty.

412
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:56,210
I didn't ask for your opinion!

413
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:59,180
You must have heard

414
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:01,580
that I've been dismissed from my post

415
00:19:01,910 --> 00:19:02,580
and expelled from Chang'an.

416
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:03,760
However, I studied and practiced martial arts

417
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:05,990
with His Highness from a young age.

418
00:19:06,550 --> 00:19:07,550
No one in the Eastern Palace

419
00:19:08,030 --> 00:19:09,450
dares to talk to me

420
00:19:09,470 --> 00:19:10,240
the way you did.

421
00:19:17,770 --> 00:19:19,210
I've sent my disciple, Xue Huan

422
00:19:19,810 --> 00:19:21,690
to the capital

423
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:22,750
to report the strange deaths in Nanzhou

424
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:24,230
to His Highness.

425
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:26,870
Prefectural Governor Xiong,

426
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:28,850
make a wise decision.

427
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:30,400
You...

428
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:32,060
Don't.

429
00:19:38,890 --> 00:19:40,960
When did you send Xue Huan back to the capital?

430
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:42,820
I didn't.

431
00:19:43,030 --> 00:19:44,690
He's just a kid and it's a long way.

432
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:45,740
I'd be worried sick.

433
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:47,740
You lied to them?

434
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:51,090
Well done!

435
00:19:53,730 --> 00:19:54,340
Why are you laughing?

436
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:57,230
I've been suspecting

437
00:19:57,260 --> 00:19:58,540
that you and His Highness

438
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:00,090
have some secret plan.

439
00:20:00,790 --> 00:20:01,950
Do you?

440
00:20:02,610 --> 00:20:03,340
Of course not.

441
00:20:03,650 --> 00:20:05,140
But you were so convincing

442
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:06,560
when you lied back there.

443
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:07,650
I learned it from you.

444
00:20:08,650 --> 00:20:09,010
No,

445
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:11,620
I learned it from Chicken Fed.

446
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:13,940
That odd man's trick

447
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,220
is quite effective

448
00:20:17,930 --> 00:20:19,160
in dealing with someone like Prefectural Governor Xiong.

449
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:21,750
Lu Lingfeng,

450
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:23,000
you've changed.

451
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:24,710
You're no longer

452
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:25,860
that frank and impulsive young man

453
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:26,940
when we first met.

454
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:27,840
Today, if you…

455
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:28,800
That's not important.

456
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:30,060
You should think about

457
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:31,120
the autopsy tomorrow.

458
00:20:33,870 --> 00:20:35,890
You're right, General.

459
00:20:41,630 --> 00:20:44,820
[Notice]

460
00:20:56,750 --> 00:21:00,190
My poor son!

461
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:05,980
You don't deserve to be treated like this.

462
00:21:07,150 --> 00:21:09,030
My poor son!

463
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:13,580
Prefectural Governor,

464
00:21:17,290 --> 00:21:20,130
are you really going to let them open the coffin?

465
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:26,920
Madam,

466
00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:30,070
your son was my old friend.

467
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:32,840
If I fail to find a clue after opening the coffin,

468
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:35,410
I'll do everything to make it up

469
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:36,760
to him when I meet him

470
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:39,440
in the underworld.

471
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:41,020
What's the use of saying this?

472
00:21:41,830 --> 00:21:42,630
Yeah.

473
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:44,460
The weather is cold now,

474
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:48,160
how can you expose my son's body to the biting wind?

475
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:50,580
I'm his mother,

476
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:53,180
but I can't stop you from doing that on him!

477
00:21:53,970 --> 00:21:55,910
I'm not worth living!

478
00:21:58,230 --> 00:21:58,890
Commander Su,

479
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:00,020
it's time.

480
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:05,190
My poor son!

481
00:22:05,870 --> 00:22:06,640
Open the coffin.

482
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:07,610
Yes.

483
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:09,780
My son!

484
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:10,630
Mom.

485
00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:11,590
Madam.

486
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:12,370
Mother.

487
00:22:15,270 --> 00:22:17,140
-Mother. -My poor son!

488
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:23,990
My poor son!

489
00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:26,330
Mom! Mom!

490
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:27,060
Mom!

491
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:29,520
Su Wuming!

492
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:30,800
You'll pay for this!

493
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:32,570
Mom.

494
00:23:17,170 --> 00:23:18,140
Look at this.

495
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:26,780
What's the problem?

496
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:27,660
Is there any problem?

497
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:28,540
What has happened actually?

498
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:29,900
It's been so long.

499
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:35,750
Rain cover!

500
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:54,190
Mom!

501
00:23:58,830 --> 00:23:59,350
Mom!

502
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:00,620
It's raining.

503
00:24:01,110 --> 00:24:05,220
Even God can't stand it!

504
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:09,180
-God! -Prefectural Governor,

505
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:10,730
it's raining heavily. Let's take shelter from the rain.

506
00:24:11,690 --> 00:24:12,200
Prefectural Governor,

507
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:14,700
my brother, Yuanfu, died of illness.

508
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:16,900
But Su Wuming insisted on opening the coffin.

509
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:19,330
They haven't found

510
00:24:19,370 --> 00:24:20,570
any trace till now.

511
00:24:21,030 --> 00:24:22,390
Please punish him

512
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:23,750
to comfort the dead!

513
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:25,020
That's right!

514
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:26,670
Punish him! Punish him!

515
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:27,650
Yes!

516
00:24:27,670 --> 00:24:29,310
Even God can't stand it!

517
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:31,410
Seal the coffin again

518
00:24:31,590 --> 00:24:33,710
and let Mr. Yan rest in peace!

519
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:35,220
Don't move!

520
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:36,540
Let Mr. Yan rest in peace!

521
00:24:36,570 --> 00:24:37,450
Don't move!

522
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:38,490
Back off! Back off!

523
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:40,010
Don't come any closer. Back off!

524
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:41,170
Back off!

525
00:24:41,850 --> 00:24:42,900
Back off!

526
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:44,430
Stop it!

527
00:24:56,410 --> 00:24:57,490
I am Lu Lingfeng

528
00:24:58,060 --> 00:24:58,900
from the Lu family of Fanyang,

529
00:24:59,250 --> 00:25:01,360
the former General of the Imperial Guards.

530
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:04,220
There is an official notice from the government,

531
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:06,860
stating that Commander Su was ordered to examine the body.

532
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:10,930
Let's see who dares to stir up trouble!

533
00:25:17,550 --> 00:25:18,150
Madam Yan,

534
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:19,860
people of Nanzhou,

535
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:21,260
Commander Su

536
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:23,500
was the disciple of Detective Di Renjie.

537
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:25,060
Several months ago,

538
00:25:25,330 --> 00:25:26,690
he solved the mysterious Chang'an black tea case,

539
00:25:26,950 --> 00:25:27,920
overawing the government officials.

540
00:25:28,490 --> 00:25:30,060
Even His Highness,

541
00:25:30,230 --> 00:25:31,110
Her Highness,

542
00:25:31,410 --> 00:25:32,600
and His Majesty

543
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:34,250
heaped praises on him.

544
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:36,840
Recently in Nanzhou,

545
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:38,810
murder cases happened one after another.

546
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:42,580
They are all related to the Nanzhou Four Scholars

547
00:25:42,790 --> 00:25:44,110
and the painting of the Stone Bridge.

548
00:25:44,810 --> 00:25:45,820
The opening of the coffin today

549
00:25:46,210 --> 00:25:47,280
is reasonable

550
00:25:47,670 --> 00:25:48,800
and necessary

551
00:25:49,010 --> 00:25:49,800
to solve the cases.

552
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,000
Only the culprit

553
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:53,330
will act maliciously and try to stop it.

554
00:25:54,630 --> 00:25:56,760
Please think carefully about it.

555
00:25:57,260 --> 00:25:58,290
Don't say I didn't warn you.

556
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:02,100
That's right.

557
00:26:02,350 --> 00:26:03,950
What he said is all correct.

558
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:07,290
I totally agree with him.

559
00:26:36,570 --> 00:26:37,610
I, Su Wuming, would like to thank you

560
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:41,310
for defending me today.

561
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:44,330
If you hadn't been so brave

562
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:46,240
to dig the grave,

563
00:26:46,810 --> 00:26:47,370
I wouldn't have

564
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:48,240
said that.

565
00:26:49,350 --> 00:26:49,920
Su Wuming,

566
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:53,260
have you ever thought

567
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:54,550
that you might lose your position

568
00:26:55,190 --> 00:26:56,400
because of this?

569
00:26:57,890 --> 00:26:58,410
Is it worth it?

570
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:03,170
It was not the Imperial Guards' duty

571
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:07,050
to track down the murderer of the brides.

572
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:08,840
Indeed, the investigation of the Chang'an black tea case

573
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:09,920
had nothing to do with you either.

574
00:27:10,450 --> 00:27:13,190
But you killed the Ghost Four,

575
00:27:13,250 --> 00:27:15,010
and killed the real murderer, Yuan Lai.

576
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:15,880
However,

577
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:18,360
you ended up like this.

578
00:27:18,690 --> 00:27:20,190
Have you ever thought

579
00:27:21,020 --> 00:27:21,910
whether it was worth it?

580
00:27:25,630 --> 00:27:26,740
Even if I could go back in time,

581
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:30,230
I would still be nosy.

582
00:27:34,270 --> 00:27:35,680
My teacher Detective Di

583
00:27:36,310 --> 00:27:37,350
was right.

584
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:40,750
When you were still a teenager,

585
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:42,280
he told me

586
00:27:42,850 --> 00:27:44,490
that you were worthy to be taught,

587
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:46,090
and would definitely become

588
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:47,550
the backbone of Tang Dynasty.

589
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:51,830
Don't lie to me.

590
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:53,600
If Detective Di really said that,

591
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:55,100
why didn't he take me as his disciple?

592
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:02,820
It's a secret.

593
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:04,090
Fed,

594
00:28:04,340 --> 00:28:05,500
come here.

595
00:28:06,330 --> 00:28:07,230
Take a look at

596
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:09,450
what's inside this.

597
00:28:10,050 --> 00:28:10,630
What is it?

598
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:14,120
This is the only thing I found today.

599
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:16,280
I hope it can help us

600
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:18,210
reveal the truth.

601
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:25,860
This seems to be

602
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:27,980
the shedding of a bug of some sort.

603
00:28:28,370 --> 00:28:28,850
That's right.

604
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:29,360
Then...

605
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:30,790
What kind of bug is it?

606
00:28:31,010 --> 00:28:31,930
Look at the shell.

607
00:28:32,310 --> 00:28:34,050
There are fine patterns on it

608
00:28:34,210 --> 00:28:35,600
which look like the tiger stripes.

609
00:28:36,030 --> 00:28:37,490
I've never seen something like this.

610
00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:39,500
The Encyclopedia of Nanzhou,

611
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:40,890
I've read it several times,

612
00:28:40,910 --> 00:28:42,580
but I didn't find a relevant entry.

613
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:50,230
Could this be the shell of a Poison Bug?

614
00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:52,590
Poison Bug?

615
00:28:56,620 --> 00:28:57,940
I'm just guessing.

616
00:28:58,810 --> 00:29:01,740
It's said that there is a kind of giant mushroom

617
00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:03,980
in the southern mountains.

618
00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:05,770
It's known as the Honey Dragon Mushroom.

619
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:09,160
It emits seven-colored glow at night,

620
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:11,810
which attracts hundreds of poisonous insects.

621
00:29:13,250 --> 00:29:14,810
Once these poisonous insects

622
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:17,110
land on the Honey Dragon Mushroom,

623
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:18,340
they will be stuck

624
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:19,670
and unable to escape.

625
00:29:20,390 --> 00:29:21,710
The mushroom rots after it rains.

626
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:24,280
Some flying leeches can be found

627
00:29:24,550 --> 00:29:26,020
in the rotten mushroom later.

628
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:28,620
They are the Poison Bugs.

629
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:31,390
They're yellow and black in color,

630
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:32,970
have saw-liked mouths,

631
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:35,870
and like the scent of ink.

632
00:29:36,270 --> 00:29:37,650
They shed their shells in the late autumn.

633
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:39,200
The shell is a precious medicine,

634
00:29:39,450 --> 00:29:40,840
and is very expensive.

635
00:29:41,210 --> 00:29:42,330
It can cure stroke.

636
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:43,820
Therefore,

637
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:48,060
the people from the south will lure these bugs with the scent of ink.

638
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:50,170
Only 30 to 40% of people can survive

639
00:29:50,570 --> 00:29:53,340
in the process of capturing the bugs,

640
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:55,950
because these bugs are very terrifying.

641
00:29:56,370 --> 00:29:59,110
They enter people's ears and devour their hearts,

642
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:04,890
and then come out from their heads.

643
00:30:05,770 --> 00:30:07,510
But in order to make money,

644
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:10,670
people take risks.

645
00:30:14,570 --> 00:30:16,540
When I was in Chang'an, I heard

646
00:30:16,650 --> 00:30:20,220
that Emperor Gaozong had stroke back then.

647
00:30:20,540 --> 00:30:22,410
Besides the acupuncture method,

648
00:30:22,430 --> 00:30:24,110
he also took many medicines.

649
00:30:24,140 --> 00:30:25,710
The most expensive one

650
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:27,860
was from Nanzhou.

651
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:30,780
Could it be this?

652
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:32,490
Probably.

653
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:34,950
But what I just said

654
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:36,440
is only written in medical books

655
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:37,980
and told in folk tales.

656
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:39,930
I haven't seen one in real life yet.

657
00:30:40,470 --> 00:30:41,010
It doesn't matter.

658
00:30:41,470 --> 00:30:43,550
As long as it is from Nanzhou,

659
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:45,770
we can go to a drug shop to

660
00:30:45,790 --> 00:30:46,660
find it out.

661
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:48,660
I'll go with you.

662
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:52,590
No need.

663
00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:54,750
There's something more important

664
00:30:54,810 --> 00:30:55,920
for you to do.

665
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:57,460
What is it?

666
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:00,840
If everyone in the painting of the Stone Bridge

667
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:02,080
is in danger,

668
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:04,170
who we need to protect the most now

669
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:05,330
is Leng Ji.

670
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:07,680
Although Zhong Boqi has servants with him at home,

671
00:31:07,710 --> 00:31:09,490
we shouldn't be careless.

672
00:31:10,150 --> 00:31:12,080
I'll send someone to protect him.

673
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:13,870
As for Leng Ji,

674
00:31:14,150 --> 00:31:15,830
he has no one to protect him,

675
00:31:15,850 --> 00:31:17,890
and he himself is stubborn.

676
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:18,410
So...

677
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:19,010
I understand.

678
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:22,160
I'll move to his house today.

679
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:26,030
What do you need?

680
00:31:30,250 --> 00:31:30,870
Buddy.

681
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:32,010
Here.

682
00:31:32,890 --> 00:31:33,840
Look at this.

683
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:36,720
Haven't we agreed

684
00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:37,940
that Mr. Huang is the one who gathers

685
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:38,870
and sells them to the drug shop?

686
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:43,600
I just want to ask about

687
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:44,780
this thing.

688
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:46,120
One alive Ink Crazed

689
00:31:46,210 --> 00:31:47,300
is worth five thousand coins.

690
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:48,660
A whole shedded shell

691
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:49,710
is worth two thousand coins.

692
00:31:50,230 --> 00:31:50,980
The piece you are holding

693
00:31:51,450 --> 00:31:52,730
is worth three hundred coins at most.

694
00:31:53,060 --> 00:31:54,310
That's a lot.

695
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:56,330
We can buy plenty of chicken.

696
00:32:00,380 --> 00:32:02,500
Can the price be higher?

697
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:04,980
You have to ask

698
00:32:05,010 --> 00:32:05,800
the shopkeeper.

699
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:13,190
You are not

700
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:15,080
from Stone Bridge Mountain, right?

701
00:32:15,570 --> 00:32:16,680
Where did you get this?

702
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:20,310
We are indeed outsiders.

703
00:32:20,350 --> 00:32:21,390
We got it by chance,

704
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:24,320
and heard that it's worth some money.

705
00:32:26,530 --> 00:32:28,090
This is Nanzhou's specialty.

706
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:29,820
It's a very precious medicine

707
00:32:30,410 --> 00:32:32,020
which can cure stroke.

708
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:35,090
Many drug merchants in Chang'an came to buy it.

709
00:32:35,890 --> 00:32:37,520
Your man said

710
00:32:37,550 --> 00:32:38,750
it's called Ink Crazed.

711
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:40,330
It's just a local name.

712
00:32:40,650 --> 00:32:41,820
These bugs are weird.

713
00:32:42,010 --> 00:32:43,140
They like the scent of ink,

714
00:32:43,730 --> 00:32:45,420
but are also the cruelest.

715
00:32:46,780 --> 00:32:48,520
They can crawl into the seven apertures of humans,

716
00:32:48,890 --> 00:32:50,170
and devour the organs.

717
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:53,710
The victim will definitely die in pain within seven days.

718
00:32:55,010 --> 00:32:55,760
As for the bug,

719
00:32:56,330 --> 00:32:57,810
they only come out of the dead body

720
00:32:58,050 --> 00:32:59,720
after several days,

721
00:32:59,750 --> 00:33:01,390
and molt to become moth.

722
00:33:01,890 --> 00:33:03,410
But most of them have no chance

723
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:04,240
to fly away alive,

724
00:33:04,970 --> 00:33:06,760
as the body has already been put into a coffin

725
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:10,070
when they come out from the dead body.

726
00:33:14,060 --> 00:33:14,840
Mom.

727
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:17,820
Mom.

728
00:33:19,210 --> 00:33:20,630
What does an Ink Crazed look like

729
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:22,150
when it's alive?

730
00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:24,060
We have some at our shop.

731
00:33:24,130 --> 00:33:25,040
Can we take a look?

732
00:33:25,630 --> 00:33:27,390
Who you are?

733
00:33:27,650 --> 00:33:28,740
Why should I show you

734
00:33:28,770 --> 00:33:30,040
such a precious medicine?

735
00:33:34,060 --> 00:33:35,150
Listen carefully.

736
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:37,330
The Military Commander of Nanzhou, Su Wuming,

737
00:33:37,470 --> 00:33:38,590
is here investigating a major case.

738
00:33:48,390 --> 00:33:49,160
Commander Su,

739
00:33:49,730 --> 00:33:50,630
please have a look.

740
00:33:57,540 --> 00:33:59,940
Your shop is indeed rich.

741
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:02,910
Even the jar containing this living creature

742
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:04,210
is made of glass.

743
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:07,340
Even in Chang'an,

744
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:09,610
the glass jar can be hardly found.

745
00:34:10,830 --> 00:34:12,570
You have no idea.

746
00:34:13,159 --> 00:34:15,600
The glaze of the glass is the best way to restrict these bugs.

747
00:34:15,989 --> 00:34:18,130
They will feel dizzy after entering the glass jar.

748
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:19,340
Otherwise,

749
00:34:19,780 --> 00:34:21,420
once any of them crawls into our seven apertures,

750
00:34:21,620 --> 00:34:22,139
we...

751
00:34:22,570 --> 00:34:24,670
We'll die.

752
00:34:25,159 --> 00:34:26,139
Interesting.

753
00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:29,030
Who collected these bugs

754
00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:29,909
for you?

755
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:31,610
In Nanzhou,

756
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:33,790
there are people capturing Ink Crazed for a living,

757
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:36,330
because the price for one

758
00:34:37,090 --> 00:34:38,580
is sufficient to support their living for a few years.

759
00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:41,580
Is Mr. Huang mentioned by your man earlier,

760
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,310
the guy who collects the bugs for you?

761
00:34:44,489 --> 00:34:45,010
Yes.

762
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:47,219
He's the one taking charge of it.

763
00:34:47,699 --> 00:34:49,170
After he puts them in this bottle,

764
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:50,290
we'll then collect it back.

765
00:34:50,650 --> 00:34:52,270
This is also to keep us safe.

766
00:34:54,170 --> 00:34:57,020
How many drug shops in Nanzhou

767
00:34:57,050 --> 00:34:58,240
are selling this?

768
00:34:58,370 --> 00:34:59,450
We are the only one.

769
00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:01,510
Those with less capital can't afford it.

770
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:07,960
[Nanzhou Prison]

771
00:35:05,110 --> 00:35:06,460
As for how much money I've earned from

772
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:07,390
collecting Ink Crazed these years,

773
00:35:07,790 --> 00:35:08,950
I've told you in detail.

774
00:35:09,410 --> 00:35:09,840
It...

775
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:12,300
It is not violating the law, right?

776
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:13,990
What I want to ask

777
00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:15,570
is another question.

778
00:35:16,970 --> 00:35:18,190
Apart from the drug shop,

779
00:35:18,870 --> 00:35:20,160
has anyone in Nanzhou

780
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:21,680
bought this from you

781
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:23,660
in private?

782
00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:25,470
No.

783
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:30,750
Not the people in the city.

784
00:35:31,230 --> 00:35:33,130
But a wandering monk has.

785
00:35:34,290 --> 00:35:35,000
Monk?

786
00:35:35,570 --> 00:35:36,180
How old is he?

787
00:35:36,470 --> 00:35:37,400
What kind of robe was he wearing?

788
00:35:37,420 --> 00:35:38,130
What accent he had?

789
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:39,550
Accent...

790
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:40,720
I really didn't figure it out.

791
00:35:41,170 --> 00:35:43,540
I don't think he was wearing a cassock.

792
00:35:45,140 --> 00:35:46,460
Not wearing a cassock?

793
00:35:46,490 --> 00:35:48,300
Then how did you know he was a monk?

794
00:35:49,730 --> 00:35:51,040
I was...

795
00:35:57,340 --> 00:35:57,860
Who is it?

796
00:35:58,360 --> 00:35:59,730
Is your surname Huang?

797
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:01,520
Yes.

798
00:36:01,810 --> 00:36:03,280
I'm from another city.

799
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:04,730
There's a stroke patient

800
00:36:04,750 --> 00:36:07,040
who wants to purchase two Ink Crazed from you.

801
00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:08,510
You may name your price.

802
00:36:10,070 --> 00:36:11,170
At that time,

803
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:13,090
I had two living ones with me,

804
00:36:14,030 --> 00:36:15,380
so I asked him for gold.

805
00:36:16,410 --> 00:36:17,440
He didn't bargain at all.

806
00:36:22,410 --> 00:36:24,720
Did he take off the bamboo hat

807
00:36:24,740 --> 00:36:25,940
only after turning around?

808
00:36:26,290 --> 00:36:26,820
Yes.

809
00:36:27,630 --> 00:36:28,760
He walked for a dozen steps.

810
00:36:30,630 --> 00:36:31,900
Did it rain that day?

811
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:33,270
No.

812
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:35,150
Was there any sign of rain?

813
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:37,780
Not really.

814
00:36:38,570 --> 00:36:40,170
So he was wearing a bamboo hat

815
00:36:40,890 --> 00:36:43,080
to cover his face.

816
00:36:44,810 --> 00:36:46,160
I didn't think that much.

817
00:37:01,610 --> 00:37:02,250
Brother Leng,

818
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:03,940
lend me some books to read.

819
00:37:04,370 --> 00:37:05,030
I don't have any.

820
00:37:06,530 --> 00:37:07,560
You are such a

821
00:37:07,770 --> 00:37:08,650
famous poet.

822
00:37:09,130 --> 00:37:10,600
Don't you have some

823
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:11,780
compilations of your own poems?

824
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:14,190
Let me read some of your poems.

825
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:14,880
That should be fine, right?

826
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:17,650
You know poems too?

827
00:37:19,390 --> 00:37:20,160
After all,

828
00:37:20,190 --> 00:37:21,180
I'm from the Lu family of Fanyang.

829
00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:22,580
All of us in the family are well educated.

830
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:23,680
You think that I don't understand poems?

831
00:37:24,460 --> 00:37:26,050
That's too much.

832
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:29,180
Since you know poems,

833
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:30,450
try to complete this poem.

834
00:37:31,410 --> 00:37:32,940
Aren't you from Chang'an?

835
00:37:33,580 --> 00:37:35,760
Let's make Chang'an the topic.

836
00:37:37,370 --> 00:37:39,680
A beauty from Chang'an is dancing in the spring.

837
00:37:40,630 --> 00:37:42,720
The scenery is too stunning to be true.

838
00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:46,810
Dancing sleeves and bending moves are now forgotten.

839
00:37:47,860 --> 00:37:50,020
Bitterness is written in face just like the frost in autumn.

840

If you're thirsty, there's tea in the room.

841

Actually, you're more charming

842
00:38:20,550 --> 00:38:22,130
than Su Wuming.

843
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:24,200
You're indeed a renowned scholar.

844
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:25,350
You have a good eye for noticing that.

is there any progress on the case?

Who told you that?

It's written all over your face.

850
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:46,780
People always say

851

that all renowned scholars can

852
00:38:49,250 --> 00:38:51,000
hide their inner thoughts and expressions.

853
00:38:51,170 --> 00:38:51,910
That is

the quality of elegance found within the demeanor during the period of Wei and Jin.

It seems that I am still far from that.

856

There's letter from a renowned scholar for you.

857
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,890
Is it from Leng Ji or Zhong Boqi?

00:39:33,770 --> 00:39:35,750
The painting of the Stone Bridge was painted then.

867
00:39:36,450 --> 00:39:37,910
I hope

868
00:39:38,350 --> 00:39:40,000
I can revisit the Stone Bridge Mountain

869
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:41,760
with Leng Ji tomorrow.

870
00:39:43,540 --> 00:39:44,420
You can't do that!

871
00:39:44,890 --> 00:39:46,380
Both of them are in a dangerous situation now.

872
00:39:46,540 --> 00:39:47,860
What if something happens on the way?

873
00:39:50,570 --> 00:39:52,940
He proposed to send someone to protect him.

874
00:39:53,070 --> 00:39:54,380
He wants to revisit the Stone Bridge Mountain,

875
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:57,790
and enjoy tea in the mountains.

876
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:00,860
Not only did he write to me,

877
00:40:01,130 --> 00:40:03,780
but also invited Prefectural Governor Xiong and Administrator Luo.

878
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:08,050
I don't think I have a reason to reject him.

879
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:11,150
Besides, you always wanted to

880
00:40:11,180 --> 00:40:12,270
visit the wonderland of the Stone Bridge.

881
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:13,950
Why don't we go together?

882
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:30,150
Brother Zhong, you are indeed a renowned scholar.

883
00:40:34,550 --> 00:40:36,730
It's not peaceful in Nanzhou recently.

884
00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:39,090
It's rumoured

885
00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:41,830
that not only the people in the painting of the Stone Bridge

886
00:40:41,850 --> 00:40:42,780
will die.

887
00:40:42,980 --> 00:40:44,940
Even the divine rock from heaven

888
00:40:45,180 --> 00:40:47,190
in the Stone Bridge Mountain

889
00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:48,620
will fall down.

890
00:40:49,660 --> 00:40:52,090
The whole Nanzhou

891
00:40:52,130 --> 00:40:53,230
will suffer by that time.

892
00:40:53,580 --> 00:40:53,950
You

893
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:56,220
are in the mood of doing all this?

894
00:40:56,990 --> 00:41:00,000
The green shows up in the late spring.

895
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:03,350
The clouds form at the peak of the mountain.

896
00:41:07,130 --> 00:41:07,840
Commander Su,

897
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:10,730
I heard that you have sent someone to protect

898
00:41:10,750 --> 00:41:11,900
Brother Zhong and Leng Ji.

899
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:14,760
Don't you dare to slack off.

900
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:16,520
If something happens to them,

901
00:41:16,850 --> 00:41:18,700
the rumor will come true.

902
00:41:19,580 --> 00:41:20,770
Don't worry, Administrator.

903
00:41:21,750 --> 00:41:23,110
In the name of protection,

904
00:41:23,340 --> 00:41:24,950
you imprisoned Leng Ji and me.

905
00:41:25,530 --> 00:41:28,020
That's your true intention, right?

906
00:41:29,060 --> 00:41:30,220
You dug the grave

907
00:41:30,540 --> 00:41:31,730
but found nothing.

908
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:37,020
You haven't provide us an explanation yet.

909
00:41:37,410 --> 00:41:37,920
No worries.

910
00:41:38,970 --> 00:41:39,590
I will.

911
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:43,740
Just like what are meant to come will arrive.

912
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:45,580
What are meant to go will fly.

913
00:41:46,620 --> 00:41:48,530
Why am I not returning?

914
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:50,600
It's not about the barren field,

915
00:41:51,250 --> 00:41:53,830
but the barren heart.

916
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:56,990
The Stone Bridge Mountain

917
00:41:57,020 --> 00:41:58,820
will be where I die in the future.

918
00:42:00,610 --> 00:42:05,040
I'm afraid that God can't do as I wish.

919
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:11,590
When I was young,

920
00:42:12,090 --> 00:42:13,700
I picked tea leaves in the Stone Bridge Mountain.

921
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:15,850
Every stone and wood in this mountain

922
00:42:16,050 --> 00:42:17,410
are connected to me.

923
00:42:17,940 --> 00:42:19,450
God can prove

924
00:42:19,780 --> 00:42:21,030
my feelings for this mountain.

925
00:42:22,310 --> 00:42:24,390
God will bless me.

926
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:28,280
God doesn't let one down easily.

927
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:30,880
But there are always people who are scheming

928
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:33,590
and get nothing in the end.

929
00:42:34,180 --> 00:42:34,940
Brother Su,

930
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:38,290
Brother Zhong invited us here for tea

931
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:40,060
to reminisce

932
00:42:40,180 --> 00:42:44,020
the friendship of the Nanzhou Four Scholars.

933
00:42:44,460 --> 00:42:44,870
You...

934
00:42:46,270 --> 00:42:47,710
Why are you always

935
00:42:49,190 --> 00:42:50,740
speaking mean things?

936
00:42:53,380 --> 00:42:55,400
You're right, Prefectural Governor.

937
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:57,590
I'm not good with words

938
00:42:57,620 --> 00:42:58,930
since I was young.

939
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:01,340
Prefectural Governor Xiong,

940
00:43:02,010 --> 00:43:02,800
Administrator Luo,

941
00:43:03,300 --> 00:43:03,910
please wait for a moment.

942
00:43:06,170 --> 00:43:08,040
I'll make tea for you now.

943
00:43:22,060 --> 00:43:26,170
♫The storm rises with no reason♫
