[Episode 17]

4
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:46,900
Dugu Xiashu has

5
00:01:47,009 --> 00:01:48,229
slept for 12 hours.

6
00:01:48,979 --> 00:01:50,700
If I'm not mistaken,

7
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:52,930
after Dugu Xiashu is awake,

8
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:55,740
he will not believe that Qinghong is dead,

9
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:57,420
nor will he admit that

10
00:01:58,009 --> 00:02:00,520
he has killed his wife and Liu Youqiu.

11
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:01,670
You are right, Commander.

12
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:03,210
He completely overturned

13
00:02:03,410 --> 00:02:04,370
his previous confession.

14
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:05,240
Brother,

15
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:08,600
I'm ready.

16
00:02:09,889 --> 00:02:10,850
When you get to Nanzhou Prison,

17
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,660
you have to listen to Dugu patiently

18
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:15,010
about his experiences in his dream

19
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:16,550
or in reality.

20
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:18,430
Draw them on paper

21
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:20,400
to help him recall

22
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:21,710
which are dreams

23
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:23,579
and which are reality.

24
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:24,180
Got it.

25
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:27,010
Headman Huang, lead the way.

26
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:28,000
Yes, sir.

27
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:29,240
Please.

28
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:39,370
If you think

29
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:40,430
you are innocent,

30
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:42,620
and you want to clear your name,

31
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:44,100
you must tell the truth

32
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:44,880
without hiding anything.

33
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:45,840
Understand?

34
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:47,620
This...

35
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:50,450
Why are you a girl?

36
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,360
It's so inconvenient.

37
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:54,560
At a time like this,

38
00:02:54,950 --> 00:02:55,660
don't mind

39
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:56,760
about such matter anymore.

40
00:02:57,410 --> 00:02:58,930
I'm Commander Su's sworn sister.

41
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,250
Do you know that

42
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:01,790
my sworn brother is Detective Di's disciple?

43
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:05,310
Di Renjie's disciple?

44
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:06,590
Yes！

45
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:09,230
The name of Detective Di is praised

46
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:10,300
because

47
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:11,680
he won't wrong any innocent person

48
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:13,560
or let any bad guy go.

49
00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:16,440
Commander Su was taught by Detectice Di.

50
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:18,150
You should have faith in him.

51
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:38,500
What are these?

52
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:39,340
What a mess.

53
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:40,990
Xijun,

54
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:44,079
this painting is the weirdest

55
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:46,770
among all your paintings.

56
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:49,430
This is

57
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:51,690
Liu Youqiu and Qinghong

58
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:52,910
secretly dating at Dugu's house.

59
00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:54,440
This is

60
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:56,050
Dugu Xiashu

61
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,329
arguing with Liu Youqiu.

62
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:58,440
And this is

63
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:00,420
Qinghong threatening Liu Youqiu

64
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:01,750
to take her away,

65
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,440
or she'll tell their affair

66
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:04,600
to Dugu Xiashu.

67
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:06,670
The last painting is

68
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,040
Liu Youqiu killing Qinghong with a kitchen knife,

69
00:04:09,730 --> 00:04:11,580
as he was too embarrassed.

70
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:14,470
These are his dreams.

71
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:15,280
No.

72
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:17,019
Dugu Xiashu said that

73
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:18,350
these are not dreams

74
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:19,260
nor reality.

75
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:20,600
But these scenes

76
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:21,510
somehow

77
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:23,050
kept appearing in his mind.

78
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,410
So I drew it.

79
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:28,950
The one who killed Qinghong was Liu Yougiu?

80
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:30,710
There is no evidence

81
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:31,740
to support this hypothesis.

82
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:34,190
Fed has cured his delusion,

83
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:36,080
but now he is hallucinating again.

84
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:38,580
Is Gudu Xiashu

85
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:40,290
joking with us?

86
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:46,180
The rain in Nanzhou

87
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:48,460
makes people

88
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:49,540
unconscious.

89
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:52,020
It's not strange to have hallucinations.

90
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:55,550
You two have been here for so long,

91
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,840
have you ever had hallucinations?

92
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:03,770
I've hallucinated of wandering around the Stone Bridge Mountain.

93
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:06,430
I...

94
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:09,180
I've hallucinated of returning to Chang'an.

95
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:15,090
Brother,

96
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:16,860
are my paintings

97
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:18,310
useless

98
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:19,220
for solving the case?

99
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:19,570
No.

100
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,360
It's very useful.

101
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:23,380
Your paintings have

102
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,970
proven Chicken Fed's inference.

103
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:28,230
Dugu Xiashu's mental state

104
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:29,460
must be having some problem.

105
00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:30,600
The root of it

106
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:34,880
might be someone was plotting against him.

107
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,480
Qinghong was killed by Liu Youqiu,

108
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:52,909
but Liu Youwang is dead now.

109
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:53,940
Will you suspect me

110
00:05:54,659 --> 00:05:56,100
for blaming everything

111
00:05:56,650 --> 00:05:58,060
on the dead?

112
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:02,660
According to the clues,

113
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:04,090
and deducing of time,

114
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:05,980
the possibility of Liu Youqiu as the murderer

115
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:06,820
is highly unlikely.

116
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:07,870
No.

117
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:09,180
It was definitely him.

118
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:12,470
Although I didn't see it with my own eyes,

119
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:13,860
but if I tell you this,

120
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:15,260
you won't doubt it.

121
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:16,960
What?

122
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:19,090
You still have a secret?

123
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:24,530
That painter is a woman.

124
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,550
I can't say it.

125
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:30,270
You have told her about

126
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:31,160
the adultery between Qinghong and Liu Youqiu.

127
00:06:31,810 --> 00:06:33,020
What else can't you say?

128
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:34,140
I...

129
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:38,760
I really can't say it.

130
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:41,140
Guards!

131
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:42,409
Torture him!

132
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:44,640
Commander Su,

133
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:46,240
I learned something

134
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:47,560
from Dugu Xiashu.

135
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,780
Some people are only afraid of punishment.

136
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:51,210
For these people,

137
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:53,640
it's best to use corporal punishment.

138
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,440
Alright.

139
00:06:59,180 --> 00:06:59,900
Minister Lu,

140
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:02,100
I'll leave him to you.

141
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:03,040
Okay.

142
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:03,710
Alright!

143
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:05,550
I'll tell you!

144
00:07:07,890 --> 00:07:09,940
Everything started two months ago,

145
00:07:10,290 --> 00:07:11,880
when Qinhong brought me

146
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:13,290
some clothes at the Confucian Temple.

147
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:32,659
It's you.

148
00:07:33,450 --> 00:07:34,710
How do you know...

149
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:36,630
I knew that you will come today,

150
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:37,909
so I came to pick you up.

151
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:41,070
Where is he?

152
00:07:41,909 --> 00:07:42,780
He went to buy candles.

153
00:07:45,409 --> 00:07:46,870
I'll wait for him here.

154
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:48,300
No way.

155
00:07:48,659 --> 00:07:50,180
If you gets sick,

156
00:07:50,290 --> 00:07:51,180
the person who is buying the candles

157
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:52,150
will blame me.

158
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,380
Let's go.

159
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:54,860
It's my honor

160
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:56,000
to hold the umbrella for you.

161
00:07:58,330 --> 00:07:58,850
Let's go.

162
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:00,720
Thank you.

163
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:17,730
Watch the steps.

164
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:19,950
Madam,

165
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:21,240
please go to the eastern hall to rest.

166
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:23,920
I'll wait for him in the courtyard,

167
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:24,510
and we'll then go in together.

168
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:25,590
No, Madam.

169
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:27,280
There's fire in the eastern hall. It's warmer.

170
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:29,210
If you freeze yourself,

171
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,600
I will be blamed.

172
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:32,179
Come.

173
00:08:32,299 --> 00:08:32,700
Let's go.

174
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,049
Let's go.

175
00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:00,080
I don't know why.

176
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,630
I was afraid that time.

177
00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:02,380
What are you afraid of?

178
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:03,610
I'm afraid that

179
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:06,320
if I follow him to the eastern hall,

180
00:09:07,570 --> 00:09:09,810
I'll see something unbearable.

181
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:11,800
Did you follow them?

182
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:13,380
If my guess is right,

183
00:09:14,210 --> 00:09:15,270
he would still go to see it.

184
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:19,820
Yes.

185
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:21,480
I went to see it.

186
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:23,100
That's because

187
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:24,660
Ji Xiang knows the rules,

188
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:25,610
and he evaded from the scene.

189
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:26,830
Otherwise,

190
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:28,620
I can't follow them.

191
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:40,750
Madam.

192
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:41,980
Are you wet?

193
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:42,560
No.

194
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:46,320
You're drenched.

195
00:09:46,970 --> 00:09:48,160
I'm so sorry.

196
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:49,460
Let me dry it for you.

197
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:53,260
Thank you, Madam.

198
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:04,920
It smells good.

199
00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:09,830
What did you say?

200
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:10,600
I said,

201
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,290
you smells so good.

202
00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:22,220
It's all because of that damn rain!

203
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:24,250
What does this have to do with the rain?

204
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:25,480
Of course it does.

205
00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:26,450
If it wasn't raining,

206
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:29,150
Qinghong wouldn't have been wet from the rain,

207
00:10:29,530 --> 00:10:31,270
and Liu Youqiu wouldn't have took advantage of it.

208
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:32,870
Why don't you blame the umbrella?

209
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,960
Why don't you blame the umbrella seller and the umbrella maker?

210
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:36,890
I... I do.

211
00:10:37,390 --> 00:10:38,230
That is why since then,

212
00:10:38,590 --> 00:10:39,740
whenever I see an umbrella seller,

213
00:10:40,050 --> 00:10:41,100
I'll buy all the umbrella.

214
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:42,300
I'll then break all of them

215
00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:43,330
by stepping on them one by one.

216
00:10:44,530 --> 00:10:45,390
What about later?

217
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:47,600
What had happened?

218
00:10:48,890 --> 00:10:49,570
Later,

219
00:10:50,570 --> 00:10:53,140
I found that Qinghong is bringing me clothes

220
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:54,300
more often

221
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:55,510
at the Confucian Temple.

222
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:59,060
Until not long ago.

223
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,160
Why are you here again?

224
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:08,210
What do you mean?

225
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:09,800
Can't I come to see you?

226
00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:11,670
Did you do

227
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:13,220
something shameful,

228
00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:15,020
or had you hide a beauty here?

229
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:17,980
I mean,

230
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:20,140
you just brought me

231
00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:21,020
clothes recently.

232
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:22,490
Can't I come again?

233
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:24,470
I want to see

234
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:25,660
what you are doing

235
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:26,740
all day here.

236
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:30,130
Madam.

237
00:11:32,570 --> 00:11:33,370
Liu Youqiu,

238
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:35,210
why are you

239
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:36,230
imprisoning him here?

240
00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:37,370
You've misunderstood.

241
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:39,310
We were studying hard in the Confucian Temple

242
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:40,540
in order to pass the exams.

243
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,410
That's enough.

244
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:43,940
You are just wasting your time

245
00:11:44,130 --> 00:11:45,550
for nothing.

246
00:11:46,370 --> 00:11:47,210
What do you mean by wasting time?

247
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:49,100
How am I wasting my time?

248
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:50,510
Yes, I've failed twice in the exams.

249
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:51,650
But as the saying goes,

250
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:52,740
passing the Mingjing is easy,

251
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:53,830
yet passing the Jinshi is hard.

252
00:11:54,050 --> 00:11:54,660
The Imperial Court

253
00:11:54,850 --> 00:11:55,870
will only hire twenty to thirty people

254
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:56,470
each year.

255
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:57,820
Even if I passed the Jinshi exam at 50,

256
00:11:57,930 --> 00:11:58,810
I'm still considered young.

257
00:11:58,870 --> 00:11:59,940
50 years old?

258
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:01,310
Are you going to

259
00:12:01,330 --> 00:12:03,020
study with him here until you are 50?

260
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:04,710
Madam, stop arguing, both of you.

261
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:05,960
I'll make you two some tea.

262
00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:06,840
Don't fight.

263
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:12,170
Later,

264
00:12:12,650 --> 00:12:14,140
I drank the tea made by Liu Youqiu,

265
00:12:14,330 --> 00:12:15,340
and I passed out.

266
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,050
I slept for four hours.

267
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:18,410
When I woke up,

268
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:20,010
Qinghong had already gone home.

269
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:21,590
I was wondering.

270
00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:23,070
I was angry at that time.

271
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:24,160
How could I have fallen asleep?

272
00:12:25,090 --> 00:12:26,140
The tea?

273
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:27,430
Yes.

274
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:28,140
Tea.

275
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:31,320
I suspect that Liu Youqiu

276
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:32,020
has put something else in the tea.

277
00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:34,660
He then did that to Qinghong.

278
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:39,900
What did you do then?

279
00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:43,960
A few days later,

280
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:47,110
I asked Liu Youqiu for a favor.

281
00:13:11,850 --> 00:13:12,520
Liu Youqiu,

282
00:13:14,570 --> 00:13:16,190
do you have the first volume of my Zhaoming Collection

283
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:17,030
with you?

284
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:17,890
I...

285
00:13:18,990 --> 00:13:20,530
No.

286
00:13:36,210 --> 00:13:36,890
No.

287
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:38,600
Did I left it

288
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:39,590
at home when I went back last time?

289
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:41,420
I need to go back home to get it.

290
00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:47,010
What's wrong?

291
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:48,890
My stomach hurts.

292
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:50,220
I wonder what was Jixiang thinking.

293
00:13:50,490 --> 00:13:51,300
He insisted on hunting some pheasant

294
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:51,920
to cook for us.

295
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:52,790
He must not have washed it clean.

296
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:54,070
Are you okay?

297
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:54,850
I'm fine.

298
00:13:54,930 --> 00:13:55,970
I'll be fine after a rest.

299
00:13:58,790 --> 00:14:00,260
Why don't you go

300
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:01,690
and get the first volume of the poem collection

301
00:14:01,730 --> 00:14:02,470
for me, is it okay?

302
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:03,940
Were you testing him on purpose?

303
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:07,540
Yes.

304
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:09,460
I must figure out

305
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:10,350
whether

306
00:14:10,370 --> 00:14:11,320
they have an affair or not!

307
00:14:13,130 --> 00:14:14,380
At the beginning,

308
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:16,180
Liu Youqiu pretended to be unwilling to help me.

309
00:14:16,770 --> 00:14:17,760
But, he agreed soon.

310
00:14:18,410 --> 00:14:19,610
By doing this,

311
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:21,550
even if there was nothing initially,

312
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:23,120
something might happen

313
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,330
when the time comes.

314
00:14:27,050 --> 00:14:28,050
I understand that,

315
00:14:29,890 --> 00:14:31,200
but I couldn't control myself.

316
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:33,440
I was even

317
00:14:34,810 --> 00:14:36,650
having a slight expectation.

318
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:37,450
What were you expecting?

319
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:38,860
I was expecting

320
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:42,790
them to really have an affair.

321
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:43,810
Dugu Xiashu,

322
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:45,450
you're crazy!

323
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:47,180
Because I care too much about her,

324
00:14:48,110 --> 00:14:49,500
I'm willing to let her cheat on me first.

325
00:14:49,530 --> 00:14:50,180
By doing this,

326
00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:51,700
I'll feel

327
00:14:51,730 --> 00:14:52,840
better.

328
00:14:53,090 --> 00:14:53,570
You...

329
00:14:56,530 --> 00:14:57,360
And then?

330
00:15:03,430 --> 00:15:04,180
The first volume of the poem collection

331
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:05,260
is not here.

332
00:15:06,370 --> 00:15:07,890
Where did he put it?

333
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:14,840
I think it's been raining for too long,

334
00:15:15,770 --> 00:15:16,840
and his brain is not working properly

335
00:15:16,930 --> 00:15:17,930
soaking in the rainwater.

336
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:21,430
It's not his brain soaking in the rainwater.

337
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:23,840
The poem collection was burned by me as firewood.

338
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:27,000
The poem collection is full of selected poems.

339
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:29,650
One scroll of it is worth thousands of kilos of firewood.

340
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:31,990
The fire is really big.

341
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:35,180
Do you mean the fire burning in the kitchen,

342
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:40,090
or your burning desire?

343
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:41,940
Liu Youqiu,

344
00:15:42,890 --> 00:15:43,910
how dare you!

345
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:45,520
It's raining heavily.

346
00:15:46,450 --> 00:15:47,990
Even if I'm timid,

347
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:50,040
I would like to do something presumptuous.

348
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:08,750
Although I didn't hit him

349
00:16:08,770 --> 00:16:09,740
with the rock,

350
00:16:10,630 --> 00:16:12,990
after Liu You Gu returned to the temple,

351
00:16:13,310 --> 00:16:14,120
I questioned him.

352
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:18,260
Why did you do that?

353
00:16:18,370 --> 00:16:20,200
Tell me. Why!

354
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:21,630
Liu Youqiu,

355
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:23,790
you have to make it clear today.

356
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:25,280
Are you crazy?

357
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:28,140
Yes.

358
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:29,430
I'm crazy!

359
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:31,020
I'm crazy because of you!

360
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:32,420
Liu Youqiu,

361
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:34,100
I... I'll kill you!

362
00:16:34,290 --> 00:16:35,420
Although I didn't do it,

363
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:36,930
Liu Youqiu was frightened.

364
00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:38,970
He went to find Qinghong immediately.

365
00:16:39,270 --> 00:16:39,820
I know

366
00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:41,270
he must be trying to persuade Qinghong

367
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:41,860
to elope with him.

368
00:16:44,530 --> 00:16:45,380
But that woman,

369
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:47,670
she is my wife after all.

370
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:48,940
She must have rejected him,

371
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:49,960
and then was killed by him.

372
00:16:51,330 --> 00:16:52,460
It's like this.

373
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:54,110
That's right.

374
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:55,230
Yes.

375
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:56,490
This is how it happened.

376
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,310
Liu Youqiu has killed Qinghong!

377
00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:02,410
Liu Youqiu has killed Qinghong!

378
00:17:06,609 --> 00:17:07,560
My head hurts.

379
00:17:08,099 --> 00:17:09,790
My head hurts!

380
00:17:10,550 --> 00:17:12,040
My head hurts!

381
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:14,740
What's wrong?

382
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:16,730
My head hurts!

383
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:18,400
It hurts!

384
00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:19,680
Hey, you two.

385
00:17:19,819 --> 00:17:20,940
Stop asking.

386
00:17:21,099 --> 00:17:22,770
Even though he has slept well,

387
00:17:22,930 --> 00:17:24,300
he can't be in an anxious state.

388
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:25,990
Dugu Xiashu,

389
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:27,440
rest for a while.

390
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:28,650
What would you like to eat?

391
00:17:30,270 --> 00:17:31,340
Hot rice porridge is the best.

392
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:32,580
I'll ask them to make some.

393
00:17:33,930 --> 00:17:35,140
Hurry up!

394
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:47,370
It is hard to distinguish between the true and the false

395
00:17:47,610 --> 00:17:48,430
based on what Dugu Xiashu has said.

396
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:50,900
To distinguish the truth,

397
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:53,190
Minsiter Lu might need to

398
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:54,200
go out again.

399
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:56,420
Understood.

400
00:18:06,650 --> 00:18:10,740
[Confucian Temple]

401
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:15,930
Is Brother Jixiang there?

402
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:22,300
Are you stealing the chicken?

403
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:23,760
I...

404
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:25,260
I'm hungry.

405
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:26,700
If you really want to eat,

406
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:27,860
you can just hunt the pheasant

407
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:28,380
with Jixiang together.

408
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:29,900
There is no need to sneak around and steal like this.

409
00:18:30,370 --> 00:18:31,880
He refused to take me with him every time.

410
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:33,840
Then follow him secretly,

411
00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:35,750
and see how he catches the pheasant.

412
00:18:36,010 --> 00:18:37,390
Learn from him, and you can hunt yourself.

413
00:18:37,710 --> 00:18:38,580
Why ask for help?

414
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:46,800
You're a grown man with healthy limbs,

415
00:18:47,290 --> 00:18:48,260
but you live on begging.

416
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:49,610
Don't you feel ashamed?

417
00:18:50,210 --> 00:18:50,560
I...

418
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:52,540
If I see you stealing again,

419
00:18:52,810 --> 00:18:54,150
I'll flog you.

420
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:54,760
No.

421
00:18:54,790 --> 00:18:55,180
Leave.

422
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:23,700
Greetings, Your Honour.

423
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:25,380
Brother Jixiang,

424
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:26,480
I'm sorry

425
00:19:26,850 --> 00:19:28,720
for entering your house

426
00:19:29,010 --> 00:19:29,630
without your permission.

427
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:30,300
It's okay.

428
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:31,340
Just now,

429
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:32,350
I saw Dong Lang

430
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:33,370
leaving sneakily.

431
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:35,920
He must have brought you here.

432
00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:38,000
Yes.

433
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:41,280
Brother Jixiang, what are you doing?

434
00:19:42,630 --> 00:19:43,480
It's winter in Nanzhou.

435
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:44,660
Even though it is not as cold as the north,

436
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:46,230
it's still gloomy and cold here.

437
00:19:46,570 --> 00:19:47,630
I've made some clothes

438
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:48,460
to withstand the cold.

439
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:52,190
You look nice and proper.

440
00:19:52,870 --> 00:19:53,730
I also heard that

441
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:54,900
you loves reading.

442
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:56,070
Why didn't you

443
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:56,730
work outside,

444
00:19:57,610 --> 00:19:59,260
but chose to live at the Confucian Temple

445
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:00,470
like a wandering wild crane?

446
00:20:03,770 --> 00:20:04,740
It's a long story.

447
00:20:05,090 --> 00:20:06,020
Life doesn't turn out

448
00:20:06,550 --> 00:20:07,390
the way you want it.

449
00:20:08,050 --> 00:20:09,050
I am fortunate enough

450
00:20:09,090 --> 00:20:10,200
to make a living

451
00:20:10,430 --> 00:20:11,140
by finding this job here.

452
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:14,190
What can I do for you,

453
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:15,550
My Honour?

454
00:20:17,490 --> 00:20:18,350
I want to ask you

455
00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:19,460
about something recently.

456
00:20:20,210 --> 00:20:21,860
It was raining that day and Qinghong came here.

457
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:23,340
Dugu Xiashu told us about this.

458
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:26,960
I'm afraid that

459
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:30,020
if I followed him to the eastern hall,

460
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:32,650
I'll see something unberable.

461
00:20:36,590 --> 00:20:37,620
That's what

462
00:20:38,810 --> 00:20:39,670
Juren Dugu said.

463
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:41,500
What?

464
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:42,820
He lied?

465
00:20:45,890 --> 00:20:46,670
It's not the case of lying,

466
00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:49,980
but the it's totally different from what had happened.

467
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:52,780
What had really happened was that Qinghong came here that day,

468
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:55,790
and found out the secret of the two Jurens.

469
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:57,080
Secret?

470
00:20:59,090 --> 00:21:00,140
It's my fault.

471
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:02,900
I hesitated from telling

472
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:04,200
Commander Su the truth the last time,

473
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:06,730
because I wanted to

474
00:21:07,790 --> 00:21:08,710
maintain their reputation.

475
00:21:09,990 --> 00:21:11,190
This is a matter of life and death.

476
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,080
I've been regretting it these days.

477
00:21:29,890 --> 00:21:31,660
Can I have another bowl of rice porridge?

478
00:21:32,630 --> 00:21:33,510
Stop eating!

479
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:39,660
Why did you hit me?

480
00:21:40,030 --> 00:21:41,510
What else can I beat you for

481
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:42,940
except for the things you've done.

482
00:21:43,670 --> 00:21:44,330
Lu Lingfeng,

483
00:21:44,990 --> 00:21:46,190
why did you hit him?

484
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:48,930
You had met Ji Xiang?

485
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:50,410
Yes.

486
00:21:51,730 --> 00:21:52,780
After all the story this person told

487
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:54,920
us earlier,

488
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:56,480
the one that he mentioned that

489
00:21:56,510 --> 00:21:57,560
he cares too much

490
00:21:58,220 --> 00:21:59,370
is not Qinghong,

491
00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:03,380
but Liu Youqiu.

492
00:22:04,930 --> 00:22:06,920
Why can't I understand what you've said?

493
00:22:07,310 --> 00:22:08,670
It didn't rain that day,

494
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:10,860
and there was no such thing as

495
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,130
Qinghong and Liuyouqiu shared an umbrella.

496
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:14,440
It wasn't Dugu Xiashu who saw

497
00:22:14,530 --> 00:22:16,340
Qinghong and Liu Youqiu flirting,

498
00:22:16,770 --> 00:22:17,810
but it was Qinghong who saw

499
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:20,100
Liu Youqiu and Dugu Xiashu filrting.

500
00:22:27,370 --> 00:22:28,710
They still found out about it.

501
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:32,680
You'll interrogate him yourself.

502
00:22:40,410 --> 00:22:41,300
You...

503
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:51,760
Dugu Xiashu,

504
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:55,490
what Minister Lu said just now...

505
00:22:56,330 --> 00:22:57,580
They found out.

506
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:01,400
They found out.

507
00:23:34,130 --> 00:23:36,110
Master, have a sip of tea.

508
00:23:37,390 --> 00:23:38,390
He committed suicide to escape from punishment!

509
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:39,250
What he had done had nothing to do with me!

510
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,120
Su Wuming.

511
00:23:40,530 --> 00:23:41,610
As the Military Commander of Nanzhou,

512
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:43,000
you have to supervise the judicial system.

513
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:44,070
I will accept

514
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:45,130
whatever punishment you sentence me to.

515
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:46,580
He could not have done the things

516
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:47,660
you said.

517
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:49,000
He has admitted it.

518
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:50,340
He said it himself.

519
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:51,860
They found out.

520
00:23:52,050 --> 00:23:52,830
Even though he said it,

521
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:54,010
it was all because of you scaring him!

522
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:55,860
If what I said is not true,

523
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,110
why didn't he refute me,

524
00:23:57,220 --> 00:23:58,220
yet he killed himself instead?

525
00:23:58,390 --> 00:23:59,710
Why didn't you refute it

526
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:00,530
when you were expelled from Chang'an?

527
00:24:00,950 --> 00:24:02,030
Didn't you think of suicide as a solution

528
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:03,530
when you had noting left to care about!

529
00:24:03,550 --> 00:24:04,260
You!

530
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:06,520
Xijun, that's too much.

531
00:24:09,410 --> 00:24:12,010
Xijun's words may hurt,

532
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:13,870
but they make sense.

533
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:15,880
Lu Lingfeng, calm down.

534
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:18,400
Listen to Xijun finish patiently,

535
00:24:18,650 --> 00:24:19,190
OK?

536
00:24:33,010 --> 00:24:34,410
That day, I‘ve listened to Dugu Xiashu

537
00:24:34,450 --> 00:24:35,430
for 12 hours.

538
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:38,460
I did feel that he was hiding something.

539
00:24:39,370 --> 00:24:41,520
But he loves Qinghong deeply,

540
00:24:41,630 --> 00:24:42,390
that can't be fake.

541
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:44,700
The person he cares about the most must have been Qinghong!

542
00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:45,660
It can't be others.

543
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:47,690
And it certainly can't be a man!

544
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:52,380
Lu Lingfeng,

545
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:55,100
I don't think the twisted love you said

546
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:56,150
is true.

547
00:24:57,010 --> 00:24:58,530
There must be something.

548
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:01,190
Dugu Xiashu is weak

549
00:25:01,790 --> 00:25:03,020
and sensitive of his own reputation.

550
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:04,300
His suicidal act

551
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:05,870
can't prove that he'd pleaded guilty.

552
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:07,560
For the words Xijun just said,

553
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:09,340
you don't have to take it seriously.

554
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:11,340
But should we

555
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:12,580
think about it carefully again?

556
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:14,310
Since the beginning of the case,

557
00:25:14,330 --> 00:25:16,970
did we miss any details so that we...

558
00:25:19,050 --> 00:25:19,810
How about this?

559
00:25:20,690 --> 00:25:22,010
Let's enjoy the tea

560
00:25:22,410 --> 00:25:23,690
while we meditate for an hour.

561
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:26,250
Xue Huan, pour your master some tea.

562
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:39,210
Why don't you let me die?

563
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:42,770
Let me die.

564
00:25:44,330 --> 00:25:46,690
I want to see Qinghong

565
00:25:47,310 --> 00:25:48,980
and Liu Youqiu.

566
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:53,370
I want to ask them about everything.

567
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:54,260
If you die,

568
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:56,270
you won't know anything!

569
00:25:56,530 --> 00:25:57,440
To be honest,

570
00:25:58,330 --> 00:26:01,030
death is much easier than living.

571
00:26:01,570 --> 00:26:03,090
When I was young,

572
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:05,490
I'd suffered way more than you did.

573
00:26:05,930 --> 00:26:07,050
Hear me out.

574
00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:09,520
You have to live no matter how hard life treats you.

575
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:19,330
Commander Su!

576
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:20,640
Minister Lu!

577
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:26,050
Commander Su! Minister Lu!

578
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:27,670
What's the rush!

579
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:29,430
Did Digu Xiashu kick the bucket?

580
00:26:29,690 --> 00:26:31,000
No. Look at this.

581
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:34,040
This is the reply letter from Linzhou.

582
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:35,090
Ten years ago,

583
00:26:35,470 --> 00:26:36,610
there was a cat burglar

584
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:37,940
named Ling Jian.

585
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:39,570
He committed many cases of

586
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:40,290
murder and theft there,

587
00:26:40,570 --> 00:26:41,510
including the city treasury.

588
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:43,260
This person is good at using iron needles as hidden weapons.

589
00:26:43,530 --> 00:26:44,780
Every shot from him is meant to kill.

590
00:26:48,610 --> 00:26:50,680
He disappeared ten years ago,

591
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:52,660
and had not heard from him yet.

592
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,730
Could it be that this Ling Jian came to Nanzhou?

593
00:26:58,010 --> 00:26:58,810
There's another news

594
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:00,450
I heard on my way here.

595
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:01,800
Liu Youqiu's father

596
00:27:02,130 --> 00:27:04,100
burned himself to death at night.

597
00:27:04,250 --> 00:27:05,060
Burned himself?

598
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:05,850
Yes.

599
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:07,160
He should be mourning for his son too much.

600
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:08,100
He was too sad.

601
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:09,450
I've sent someone over.

602
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:24,910
After burning, with the help of his neighbours,

603
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:25,880
the fire has stop spreading.

604
00:27:26,390 --> 00:27:26,920
But...

605
00:27:27,890 --> 00:27:30,040
he still died.

606
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:38,250
He was burned after he died.

607
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:40,260
After he died?

608
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:42,900
The coroner hasn't arrived yet.

609
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:45,200
If they check carefully,

610
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:46,490
it's not hard for them to find out.

611
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:49,850
If a living person encounters a fire,

612
00:27:49,930 --> 00:27:50,870
in his frightened flight,

613
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:53,180
he will inhale the ashes from the fire,

614
00:27:53,210 --> 00:27:54,500
and the ashes will stick in his nasal.

615
00:27:54,850 --> 00:27:56,230
However, there were no ashes found

616
00:27:56,770 --> 00:27:58,530
in his nose,

617
00:27:58,770 --> 00:28:00,170
nor in his mouth.

618
00:28:00,890 --> 00:28:01,750
This means that

619
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:03,980
he was killed first

620
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:06,640
and this house was lit later.

621
00:28:07,230 --> 00:28:08,550
The murderer is indeed cruel.

622
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:12,900
This case may be related to the previous case.

623
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:15,180
What do you think?

624
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:18,410
When I was meditating,

625
00:28:19,570 --> 00:28:20,370
I thought...

626
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:24,750
I also thought of what I might've missed.

627
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:27,060
Follow me.

628
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:42,260
[Wende Hall]

629
00:29:11,470 --> 00:29:13,420
Greetings, Commander Su.

630
00:29:13,470 --> 00:29:14,950
Where are you going?

631
00:29:15,590 --> 00:29:18,000
I was enlightened by Minister Lu yesterday.

632
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:20,640
I want to go to a bigger place

633
00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:22,430
to broaden my horizon,

634
00:29:23,290 --> 00:29:24,770
and do things I should do.

635
00:29:25,510 --> 00:29:26,700
I'm nearly 40.

636
00:29:27,410 --> 00:29:28,290
I hope it's not too late.

637
00:29:30,330 --> 00:29:31,150
I see.

638
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:33,250
Actually,

639
00:29:33,370 --> 00:29:35,110
I saw that you liked reading,

640
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:36,210
and I really admire you.

641
00:29:36,610 --> 00:29:39,150
If you really have ambition,

642
00:29:39,650 --> 00:29:41,950
can you stay for a while,

643
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:43,860
so I can recommend you to my higher-ups.

644
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:45,310
Maybe you can

645
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:47,650
get a job immediately in the prefectural governor's mansion.

646
00:29:48,650 --> 00:29:49,900
Thank you for your appreciation.

647
00:29:51,070 --> 00:29:53,550
I do want to be an official,

648
00:29:53,810 --> 00:29:55,020
but I don't want to rely on others.

649
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:57,930
After all, I've been studying hard

650
00:29:58,960 --> 00:29:59,770
since I came to this temple.

651
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:01,380
I want to see

652
00:30:01,910 --> 00:30:03,160
if I can do it myself.

653
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:05,910
Fine.

654
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:09,340
Then I wish you for a bright future.

655
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:11,280
Thank you, Commander Su.

656
00:30:12,890 --> 00:30:13,350
Go.

657
00:30:35,070 --> 00:30:35,640
Stop!

658
00:30:38,230 --> 00:30:38,930
Give me your money!

659
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:40,130
My money?

660
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:41,780
I don't have anything for you to rob.

661
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:43,430
It's not raining now,

662
00:30:43,770 --> 00:30:44,770
but you're holding an umbrella.

663
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:46,570
You must be up to something.

664
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:49,000
Says a man

665
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:50,040
who is wearing a bamboo rain hat,

666
00:30:50,490 --> 00:30:52,130
and a straw rain cape on a sunny day.

667
00:30:52,490 --> 00:30:53,380
I am a robber.

668
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:55,460
I must hide my identity.

669
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:57,920
But you? You must be using the umbrella

670
00:30:57,950 --> 00:30:59,570
to hide all your valuables.

671
00:30:59,830 --> 00:31:00,810
Give it to me now,

672
00:31:01,330 --> 00:31:02,290
If you still want to live!

673
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:03,680
I'm just a scholar.

674
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:05,600
I don't have any valuables.

675
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:11,900
A scholar?

676
00:31:12,650 --> 00:31:14,680
Do you think you can pretend to be a scholar just with your bookish outfit?

677
00:31:15,930 --> 00:31:18,220
You look more like a bandit to me.

678
00:31:19,370 --> 00:31:20,470
Do I know you?

679
00:31:20,930 --> 00:31:21,570
No.

680
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:23,640
I just don't believe that you're a scholar.

681
00:31:25,610 --> 00:31:27,600
I was a bandit for the first half of my life,

682
00:31:28,770 --> 00:31:30,430
but I want to be an official for the rest of my life.

683
00:31:31,210 --> 00:31:31,810
Can't I?

684
00:31:32,750 --> 00:31:33,680
If that's the case,

685
00:31:34,370 --> 00:31:36,070
recite that unappreciated scholar's article,

686
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:37,280
Preface to Tengwang Pavillion.

687
00:31:39,490 --> 00:31:40,530
If you recite one word wrongly,

688
00:31:41,590 --> 00:31:42,990
I'll cut you one more time.

689
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:45,710
Preface to Tengwang Pavillion.

690
00:31:47,410 --> 00:31:48,140
Good article.

691
00:31:49,510 --> 00:31:50,680
Unfortunately, I don't have the time.

692
00:31:51,310 --> 00:31:52,440
But since you want to hear it,

693
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,040
I can recite one paragraph,

694
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:57,400
which is also my favorite part.

695
00:32:01,410 --> 00:32:02,130
Alas!

696
00:32:03,490 --> 00:32:04,880
I am ill fated,

697
00:32:05,780 --> 00:32:07,080
and my life id full of frustrations.

698
00:32:08,490 --> 00:32:09,790
Feng Tang grew old quickly

699
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:11,770
and Li Guang had difficulty getting promoted.

700
00:32:12,770 --> 00:32:14,500
Jia Yi was unjustly exiled to Changsha.

701
00:32:14,690 --> 00:32:15,660
Was it because there was no wise emperor on the throne?

702
00:32:16,460 --> 00:32:18,090
Liang Hong had to seek refuge at the seaside.

703
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:19,710
Was it because there was no good government in his time?

704
00:32:20,410 --> 00:32:22,360
Fortunately, what supports one is the belief

705
00:32:22,750 --> 00:32:23,850
that a man of noble character always contented with his lot.

706
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:25,530
Old as one is, he gains vigor with age

707
00:32:25,690 --> 00:32:27,570
and by no means wavers in his aspiration.

708
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:29,090
Poor as one is, he is all the more determined in adversity

709
00:32:29,130 --> 00:32:30,410
and by no means gives us his ambition.

710
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:32,660
One heeps his integrity even if he has drunk the water of the spring of Avarice

711
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:35,250
and is cheerful even is he is confronted with misfortune.

712
00:32:35,850 --> 00:32:38,330
Though the North Sea is far away, one can still get there with the help of the strong wind.

713
00:32:38,370 --> 00:32:41,060
Though the morning is gone, it is not too late to make up the loss in the evening.

714
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,340
Meng Chang was noble and honest,

715
00:32:42,450 --> 00:32:44,070
but his devotion to the country was futile.

716
00:32:44,210 --> 00:32:45,410
Ruan Ji was unruly and untrammeled,

717
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:47,670
but he burst out crying when in dire straits.

718
00:32:57,700 --> 00:32:58,720
I

719
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:00,900
am an insignificant scholar of a low official position

720
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:01,830
and am of the same age as Zhong Jun,

721
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:02,780
But unlike him,

722
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:04,260
I have no opportunity to serve in the army.

723
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:05,300
I will follow the example of Ban Chao, who threw aside the writing brush to enlist in the armed services

724
00:33:05,330 --> 00:33:07,300
and I admire Zong Que who made up his mind to seek a military career by braving the wind and waves.

725
00:34:10,739 --> 00:34:11,780
Old drunkard！

726
00:34:12,090 --> 00:34:13,340
Grab the spear!

727
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:22,670
Using a hidden weapon in front of me?

728
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:29,090
Sword!

729
00:34:46,179 --> 00:34:46,790
What's the rush?

730
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:48,949
You are good in literature.

731
00:34:49,730 --> 00:34:51,190
Why don't you continue to recite that article.

732
00:34:51,909 --> 00:34:52,820
I haven't heard enough.

733
00:34:53,570 --> 00:34:54,739
Minister Lu is a martial arts master.

734
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:56,870
I can't kill you.

735
00:34:57,500 --> 00:34:58,920
But the helper you brought,

736
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:01,310
I must kill him.

737
00:35:03,030 --> 00:35:04,250
Fed, hide!

738
00:35:05,690 --> 00:35:06,610
Don't come over!

739
00:35:06,860 --> 00:35:07,650
Don't come over!

740
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:09,200
You!

741
00:35:16,410 --> 00:35:18,200
I told you not to come over.

742
00:35:36,110 --> 00:35:36,560
Sit!

743
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:42,530
Should I call you Ji Xiang

744
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:44,960
or Ling Jian?

745
00:35:46,010 --> 00:35:47,370
I don't understand what you're talking about.

746
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:52,160
You've been disappearing from Linzhou for ten years.

747
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:55,120
Why did you come to Nanzhou to commit a crime?

748
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:56,980
And killed three people

749
00:35:57,490 --> 00:35:59,230
at once?

750
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:04,640
Do you have any evidence?

751
00:36:07,710 --> 00:36:08,530
This man

752
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:11,200
was once a general of the Imperial Guards.

753
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:12,730
With his martial arts skills,

754
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:15,730
he would have captured you with no trouble.

755
00:36:16,490 --> 00:36:20,080
He just wanted to force you to use hidden weapons

756
00:36:21,050 --> 00:36:22,620
in front of the public.

757
00:36:23,410 --> 00:36:24,740
After the second autopsy,

758
00:36:24,740 --> 00:36:26,270
and comparing the steel needles,

759
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:27,700
Qinghong was indeed killed

760
00:36:27,730 --> 00:36:29,060
by your hidden weapon.

761
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:32,420
Killing one people is already a capital crime.

762
00:36:32,890 --> 00:36:34,710
Do you still have to hide

763
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:37,070
your crime of killing Liu and his son?

764
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:41,340
You can't hide it even if you want to.

765
00:36:44,630 --> 00:36:46,350
This is what we found

766
00:36:46,620 --> 00:36:47,450
in your bag.

767
00:36:47,710 --> 00:36:48,980
The letter,

768
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:51,550
which Liu Youqiu's father wrote to his old family friends in the capital.

769
00:36:51,970 --> 00:36:55,130
This letter has paved the path for Liu Youqiu

770
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:56,200
to become a imperial scholar.

771
00:36:57,820 --> 00:36:59,860
You must have stolen it

772
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:02,690
before you set Liu's house on fire.

773
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:07,330
You're just a dogsbody who loves to read,

774
00:37:07,990 --> 00:37:09,180
a bandit daydreaming

775
00:37:09,210 --> 00:37:10,530
to become a imperial scholar.

776
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:13,420
Do you really want to go to Chang'an?

777
00:37:13,660 --> 00:37:15,210
I only hate you and Lu

778
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:16,410
who have came to this place,

779
00:37:17,270 --> 00:37:19,070
and stopped me from being an official in the capital.

780
00:37:19,210 --> 00:37:19,890
Shut up!

781
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:21,480
If a bandit like you

782
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:22,790
can be an official,

783
00:37:23,170 --> 00:37:24,930
isn't that a huge disgrace for the Tang Dynasty?

784
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:28,730
But what I don't understand is

785
00:37:30,340 --> 00:37:32,010
how I

786
00:37:32,410 --> 00:37:33,310
give myself away.

787
00:37:38,190 --> 00:37:40,580
The way you catch the pheasant.

788
00:37:51,690 --> 00:37:52,550
I confess.

789
00:37:56,130 --> 00:37:57,000
I am from He County

790
00:37:58,360 --> 00:37:59,510
and have been an orphan since young.

791
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:01,600
My master took me in

792
00:38:01,630 --> 00:38:03,030
and taught me the skills of martial arts and hidden weapons.

793
00:38:03,850 --> 00:38:05,370
After that, my master died in a clash.

794
00:38:06,410 --> 00:38:07,960
I became an outlaw living in the forest after I avenged him.

795
00:38:08,570 --> 00:38:09,620
In order to avoid the chase,

796
00:38:10,010 --> 00:38:11,440
I ran to a temple in Linzhou and changed my name to

797
00:38:12,570 --> 00:38:13,000
Ling Jian.

798
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:15,780
But I couldn't stand the tedious life,

799
00:38:15,950 --> 00:38:17,100
so I became a cat burglar.

800
00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:20,500
That double life of being

801
00:38:20,530 --> 00:38:22,070
a monk by day and a burglar by night,

802
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:24,470
has given me great pleasure.

803
00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:26,580
But when I reached 30,

804
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:29,390
I felt that

805
00:38:29,420 --> 00:38:30,500
everything was boring.

806
00:38:32,110 --> 00:38:34,430
So I retired and came to Nanzhou.

807
00:38:35,770 --> 00:38:36,300
I donated my money

808
00:38:37,860 --> 00:38:38,830
and built that Confucian temple.

809
00:38:40,290 --> 00:38:40,870
What did you say?

810
00:38:41,190 --> 00:38:42,510
You're the donor of the construction of that temple?

811
00:38:43,060 --> 00:38:43,880
Is that hard to believe?

812
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:46,380
Since the temple was built,

813
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:47,630
I have been staying in the temple

814
00:38:47,660 --> 00:38:48,740
as a dogsbody.

815
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:50,630
Although there are scholars in Nanzhou,

816
00:38:51,170 --> 00:38:52,200
but only a few people

817
00:38:53,050 --> 00:38:54,000
came to worship in a year.

818
00:38:55,290 --> 00:38:56,920
Most of them left after burning some incense sticks.

819
00:38:57,420 --> 00:38:58,650
I was enjoying the peace.

820
00:38:59,950 --> 00:39:00,720
Who would've thought?

821
00:39:03,370 --> 00:39:04,140
Three years ago...

822
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:16,020
Put it down.

823
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:16,770
You can leave now.

824
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:17,600
-Yes. -Yes.

825
00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:24,580
Sir, what are you...

826
00:39:24,980 --> 00:39:26,780
Please call me Juren Dugu.

827
00:39:27,590 --> 00:39:29,450
Greetings, Juren Dugu.

828
00:39:29,750 --> 00:39:30,980
I'm going to study here and prepare for the exam.

829
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:32,690
Help me choose a room.

830
00:39:33,450 --> 00:39:34,300
Take the money.

831
00:39:34,420 --> 00:39:35,890
From now on, you should

832
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:36,720
take care of my meals everyday.

833
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:39,010
The Confucian temple is a place to enshrine and worship Confucius.

834
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:41,740
I couldn't refuse

835
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:43,870
to let him stay and study here.

836
00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:46,780
So I made up a lie

837
00:39:47,210 --> 00:39:48,520
that the temple was haunted

838
00:39:50,050 --> 00:39:51,010
to scare him away.

839
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:58,470
Ji Xiang,

840
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:01,960
didn't you say that there's a ghost in the temple?

841
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:03,110
Where is the ghost?

842
00:40:08,060 --> 00:40:10,140
Could it be a female ghost?

843
00:40:10,850 --> 00:40:11,900
I've been waiting for her for half a month.

844
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:12,950
Why isn't she here yet?

845
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:16,870
It must have been the righteous in you

846
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:18,540
that scared her away.

847
00:40:18,780 --> 00:40:19,990
You said the temple was haunted

848
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:22,390
because you don't have Confucius in your heart,

849
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:24,450
although you live in the Confucian temple.

850
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:26,230
What do you mean?

851
00:40:26,610 --> 00:40:27,300
The sages said

852
00:40:27,730 --> 00:40:29,340
"Confucius does not talk about any extraordinary things, feats of strength, disorder, and spiritual beings."

853
00:40:30,390 --> 00:40:31,190
You

854
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:33,520
should study more in the future.

855
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:34,350
Don't believe in

856
00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:35,160
the demon and ghost any more.

857
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:36,780
Take it.

858
00:40:37,340 --> 00:40:38,140
Since then,

859
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:40,320
I often borrowed books from Dugu Xiashu.

860
00:40:40,730 --> 00:40:43,200
I gradually fell in love with studying.

861
00:40:45,530 --> 00:40:47,260
The King of Qin has the intention of conquering the whole country,

862
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:49,260
claiming possession of the world,

863
00:40:50,890 --> 00:40:52,410
claiming possession of the world...

864
00:40:57,730 --> 00:40:59,120
sweeping the four seas,

865
00:40:59,310 --> 00:41:00,650
and annexing the whole universe.

866
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:02,070
Back at that time,

867
00:41:02,770 --> 00:41:03,720
with the Shang's help,

868
00:41:04,050 --> 00:41:05,000
internally, he established the law,

869
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:06,040
encouraged farming and weaving,

870
00:41:06,410 --> 00:41:07,920
and constructed defensive and offensive equipment.

871
00:41:08,410 --> 00:41:10,120
Externally, he practiced a strategy of balance and made the lords fight among themselves.

872
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:11,540
As a result,

873
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:13,540
the Qin easily took over the land west of the Yellow River

874
00:41:14,620 --> 00:41:15,310
That's right, that's right.

875
00:41:16,130 --> 00:41:17,150
I am stupid.

876
00:41:18,090 --> 00:41:19,330
Don't say that, you're doing great.

877
00:41:20,010 --> 00:41:21,640
When I studied The Faults of Qin,

878
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:22,580
I was younger than you,

879
00:41:22,930 --> 00:41:23,850
but I didn't memorize it as fast as you.

880
00:41:24,550 --> 00:41:26,770
You are a genius.

881
00:41:27,450 --> 00:41:29,230
I, the burglar who've committed many crimes,

882
00:41:30,490 --> 00:41:32,490
was praised by Dugu Xiashu.

883
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:35,550
You are a genius.

884
00:41:37,460 --> 00:41:38,330
I was so happy

885
00:41:38,550 --> 00:41:40,190
that I couldn't sleep for three days and nights.

886
00:41:40,940 --> 00:41:42,230
From then,

887
00:41:42,550 --> 00:41:43,590
I had an idea

888
00:41:43,620 --> 00:41:44,520
deep in my heart.

889
00:41:45,110 --> 00:41:46,790
Others can all study for the exam,

890
00:41:48,210 --> 00:41:49,780
why can't I go to the capital

891
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:51,030
and take the exam to become an official too?

892
00:41:52,630 --> 00:41:53,910
Dugu Xiashu failed the test twice.

893
00:41:53,940 --> 00:41:55,130
That's because he's not gifted enough.

894
00:41:56,990 --> 00:41:58,640
If I study hard for a few years,

895
00:41:58,890 --> 00:42:00,830
I'll succeed in one blow.

896
00:42:02,140 --> 00:42:02,700
In that case,

897
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:04,830
the rest of my life

898
00:42:04,890 --> 00:42:06,130
would be distinctly different from the first half of my life.

899
00:42:07,630 --> 00:42:09,420
Isn't this kind of distinct-seperate life

900
00:42:09,790 --> 00:42:12,970
more exciting

901
00:42:14,190 --> 00:42:15,100
than the double life I used to have?

902
00:42:15,980 --> 00:42:17,440
So, you, the burglar

903
00:42:17,980 --> 00:42:19,130
began to study hard

904
00:42:19,350 --> 00:42:21,320
in the temple.

905
00:42:23,730 --> 00:42:24,970
Until one day...

906
00:42:52,580 --> 00:42:56,690
♫The storm rises with no reason♫

907
00:42:57,390 --> 00:42:59,770
♫In the night of illusions♫

908
00:43:01,530 --> 00:43:03,120
♫I go into the maze♫

909
00:43:05,340 --> 00:43:10,020
♫In a world of prosperity♫

910
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:13,170
♫A heart burns with obsession♫

911
00:43:14,230 --> 00:43:16,180
♫With the darkness rising♫

912
00:43:17,570 --> 00:43:23,230
♫I can't stop wandering through the night♫

913
00:43:23,990 --> 00:43:30,170
♫With light in my heart, I'm not afraid of the storm♫

914
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:34,220
♫It's because of justice♫

915
00:43:36,970 --> 00:43:42,830
♫That I seek a truth for this long, lonely night♫

916
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:49,540
♫The heaven and earth are held together by a strong will♫

917
00:43:50,540 --> 00:43:52,330
♫The people are in peace♫

918
00:43:52,550 --> 00:43:56,700
♫Carving right and wrong into a clear heart♫

919
00:43:57,160 --> 00:43:58,380
♫The truth♫

920
00:43:58,930 --> 00:44:02,000
♫Will reinterpret this justice♫

921
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:08,160
♫Even if there is fog♫

922
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:11,150
♫Even if there are invisible waves♫

923
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:14,750
♫I'll tell the story of the fate♫

924
00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:21,270
♫Tell the love of the world♫

925
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:24,760
♫For the memory of grace♫

926
00:44:25,690 --> 00:44:28,060
♫And the resentment is not yet over♫

927
00:44:29,050 --> 00:44:34,490
♫The rivers and mountains are immortal, the clouds are overturned♫

928
00:44:35,420 --> 00:44:41,620
♫To be consoled by the truth, even with thorns on my back♫

929
00:44:41,940 --> 00:44:46,340
♫It's because of justice♫

930
00:44:48,310 --> 00:44:54,590
♫That I seek a truth for this long, lonely night♫

931
00:44:54,870 --> 00:45:00,760
♫The heaven and earth are held together by a strong will♫

932
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:03,850
♫The people are in peace♫

933
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:08,310
♫Carving right and wrong into a clear heart♫

934
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:10,400
♫The truth♫

935
00:45:10,430 --> 00:45:14,160
♫Will reinterpret this justice♫

936
00:45:14,410 --> 00:45:20,520
♫Even if there are a thousand sails, it's not a waste of time♫

937
00:45:20,890 --> 00:45:27,080
♫What I am afraid of is the unrighted wrong♫

938
00:45:27,690 --> 00:45:29,610
♫What is the meaning of life and death?♫

939
00:45:29,830 --> 00:45:33,960
♫I'll paint the sunshine into the landscape♫

940
00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:36,000
♫The spirit of righteousness♫

941
00:45:36,150 --> 00:45:39,570
♫Exists for the one I care♫
