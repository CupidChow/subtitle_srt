5
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:50,570
Su,

6
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:54,710
you're still a Military Commander after going to Ninghu,

7
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:56,289
but that's a prosperous place

8
00:01:56,490 --> 00:01:59,100
located south of Chang Jiang River.

9
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:00,340
It's in Zhongzhou.

10
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:04,340
You're actually promoted.

11
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:06,610
Prefectural Governor Xiong,

12
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,389
it hasn't been long

13
00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:11,390
since I came to Nanzhou.

14
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:14,190
How come I got a promotion so soon?

15
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:15,690
It makes sense.

16
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:18,090
Commander Su,

17
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:19,570
you deserve the promotion.

18
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:21,310
During the days you've been in Nanzhou,

19
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,520
you've worked very hard

20
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:25,579
and made sure everything was well-organized.

21
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:27,829
You're making me ashamed as an Administrator in comparison with you.

22
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:28,810
Most importantly,

23
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:31,750
you have someone powerful to back you up.

24
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:34,390
When you become successful,

25
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:36,880
don't forget to

26
00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:38,480
put in a good word for me and Administrator Luo.

27
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:39,700
What?

28
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:41,740
Lu Lingfeng was impeached and dismissed,

29
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,620
but Su Wuming got a promotion?

30
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,610
Lu, you're back!

31
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:49,710
You cracked a big case in Ju County.

32
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,440
You were supposed to be rewarded,

33
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:54,120
but out of our expectations…

34
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,600
You were impeached.

35
00:02:57,829 --> 00:02:58,940
Prefectural Governor Xiong and I

36
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,060
had nothing to do with it.

37
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:03,410
You mean

38
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:06,000
someone used me as a stepping stone

39
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:06,640
to get promoted?

40
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,320
It can't be.

41
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:10,300
When I was expelled from the capital,

42
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:12,260
it was Commander Su who took me in.

43
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,410
Impeaching me

44
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:14,860
would do him no good.

45
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:17,240
Of course it wasn't Commander Su.

46
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:19,860
Su,

47
00:03:20,579 --> 00:03:23,530
can I tell him the truth?

48
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:27,110
Sure.

49
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:30,690
Lu,

50
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:32,820
a few days ago,

51
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:35,470
the court sent

52
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:38,310
an Imperial Inspector to Nanzhou.

53
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:39,760
An Imperial Inspector?

54
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:44,650
Is he working for Her Highness?

55
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:51,850
I see.

56
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:53,600
During the months I spent in Ju County,

57
00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:56,020
I missed the liquor and delicacies

58
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:57,340
of Gourmet Restaurant very much.

59
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,960
Prefectural Governor Xiong, Administrator Luo,

60
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:03,700
can I have the honor

61
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:06,030
of treating you to a meal?

62
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:08,230
A free meal?

63
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:11,610
Count me in!

64
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:12,240
Fed.

65
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:14,710
Lu Lingfeng,

66
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:16,600
have you taken me as your friend or not?

67
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:18,950
You left Ju County without telling me.

68
00:04:21,329 --> 00:04:22,029
Fed,

69
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:23,720
I saw you busy helping

70
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:25,330
people with headaches in Ju County.

71
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:26,720
I didn't want to disturb you.

72
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:27,830
Why did you...

73
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:31,720
I have disciples now.

74
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:33,040
Besides Zhai Liang,

75
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:34,340
I have another four doctors

76
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,240
as my disciples.

77
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:36,770
I've told them the prescription

78
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:38,790
and the acupuncture method.

79
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:40,670
I'm sure they can

80
00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:43,700
cure those with headaches in Ju County.

81
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:46,740
In my opinion,

82
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:48,630
we should have a celebration.

83
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:52,230
It is for Lu Lingfeng who cracked the tricky case,

84
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:54,500
and for Chicken Fed

85
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:56,080
who helped so many patients.

86
00:04:57,420 --> 00:04:57,940
Yeah.

87
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,770
Let's invite Headman Huang, Headman Xie,

88
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:02,730
Ouyang Quan, and the poet, Leng Ji too.

89
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:04,600
All our friends should come.

90
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:05,940
Let's go on a spree!

91
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:06,880
Great!

92
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:10,060
We'll all drink our fill tonight.

93
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:18,210
Tonight,

94
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:19,510
Prefectural Governor Xiong,

95
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:20,920
Administrator Luo,

96
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,430
Ouyang Quan,

97
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:23,890
and Leng Qi

98
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:25,230
were all drunk.

99
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,010
Headman Huang and Headman Xie

100
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:29,590
were so happy.

101
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:31,500
They never had the chance

102
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:32,930
to drink with the Prefectural Governor before.

103
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:34,980
They thanked me again and again.

104
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:42,340
Su Wuming,

105
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:44,659
I want to say thank you.

106
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:46,680
When I was in Ju County,

107
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:49,600
the three old books you lent me

108
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:50,940
came in handy.

109
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:53,850
I wasn't impressed when I read them for the first time,

110
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:56,630
but I benefited a lot from them later.

111
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,680
They are indeed some amazing books.

112
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:07,310
Lu Lingfeng,

113
00:06:08,590 --> 00:06:10,290
you're not an ordinary man.

114
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:11,420
What do you mean?

115
00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:12,990
For most people,

116
00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:15,250
if they offend Her Highness,

117
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:17,220
they will be in His Highness's graces.

118
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:18,390
If they offend His Highness,

119
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:20,520
they will be thought highly of by Her Highness.

120
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,210
But you,

121
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:24,910
you was expelled from Chang'an by His Highness

122
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:27,060
and then dismissed by Her Highness.

123
00:06:27,850 --> 00:06:30,340
I never knew anyone like you.

124
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:32,360
Not a single one.

125
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,000
What's the point of saying

126
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,290
those useless words?

127
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:37,530
You drank a lot tonight,

128
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:41,010
you were so high-spirited.

129
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:42,630
I wonder

130
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:45,940
if you really

131
00:06:46,210 --> 00:06:47,670
don't give a damn about being dismissed.

132
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:52,920
It doesn't matter

133
00:06:53,530 --> 00:06:54,610
whether I give it a damn or not.

134
00:06:55,330 --> 00:06:56,530
Let's talk about you.

135
00:06:57,820 --> 00:06:58,980
It's Her Highness's order

136
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:00,940
to transfer you to Ninghu, right?

137
00:07:06,570 --> 00:07:08,360
I've underestimated you.

138
00:07:08,850 --> 00:07:09,970
I thought

139
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:13,080
you would live an idyllic life

140
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,840
and be a carefree man in Nanzhou.

141
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:15,810
I didn't expect

142
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:18,060
you to work so hard

143
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:20,630
that the Prefectural Governor and the Administrator

144
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:21,940
were left with nothing to do.

145
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:24,450
No wonder you gained favor of Her Highness.

146
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:27,090
Fine.

147
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:29,900
It was Her Highness who promoted me.

148
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:30,800
Happy now?

149
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:33,659
Tell me,

150
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,190
Lu Lingfeng,

151
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:37,590
what's your plan for the future?

152
00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:39,870
How about

153
00:07:40,010 --> 00:07:41,890
going to Ninghu with me

154
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,150
and being

155
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:44,330
my personal staff again?

156
00:07:45,010 --> 00:07:46,650
I feel at ease

157
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:48,760
with you by my side.

158
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:53,340
What you said

159
00:07:53,790 --> 00:07:55,310
is not what I want.

160
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:56,740
From now on,

161
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,409
I'll live a free and easy life.

162
00:08:00,170 --> 00:08:01,520
Free and easy!

163
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:19,210
Did Su Wuming you to persuade me?

164
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:20,850
I'm not here to persuade you.

165
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:23,400
I'm here to tell you

166
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,690
I'm willing to go anywhere with you.

167
00:08:31,650 --> 00:08:32,590
What did you say?

168
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:36,640
Pei Xijun

169
00:08:37,669 --> 00:08:38,850
is willing to

170
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:41,429
wander around the world

171
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:43,710
with Lu Lingfeng.

172
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:46,150
I'll follow you to anywhere

173
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,000
no matter what happens.

174
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:20,460
Excuse me?

175
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:24,070
I sent you to persuade Lu Lingfeng

176
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:25,410
to go to Ninghu with me,

177
00:09:25,570 --> 00:09:26,870
but you told him

178
00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:28,550
you would join him wandering around instead?

179
00:09:29,450 --> 00:09:30,900
Xijun, my sister,

180
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:33,140
are you sure of it?

181
00:09:33,310 --> 00:09:34,040
Yes.

182
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:35,810
Please let me go with him.

183
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:38,190
But if one day

184
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:39,540
your father asks me about you,

185
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:40,380
what should I say?

186
00:09:41,650 --> 00:09:42,730
Just tell him

187
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:44,840
that I've left to travel around the world with Lu Lingfeng.

188
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,240
Tell him there's no need to worry.

189
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:54,450
That day in Chang'an,

190
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:57,700
I pointed out that the man you fell in love with

191
00:09:57,810 --> 00:09:59,130
is Lu Lingfeng.

192
00:09:59,410 --> 00:10:00,330
But I've never imagined

193
00:10:01,290 --> 00:10:03,040
things would end up like this.

194
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:05,140
He was born

195
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,770
in a prestigious family.

196
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:09,030
You're the daughter of a high-ranking official.

197
00:10:09,170 --> 00:10:10,000
Are you two really going

198
00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:13,640
to be wanderers?

199
00:10:15,410 --> 00:10:16,070
Maybe

200
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,870
that is the best destination for us.

201
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:25,170
Never mind.

202
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:29,590
I wish you

203
00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:32,740
all the best.

204
00:10:34,310 --> 00:10:35,170
Thank you, brother.

205
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:52,350
No matter how far I go,

206
00:10:52,890 --> 00:10:54,370
I will never forget you.

207
00:10:55,770 --> 00:10:57,290
No matter where you work in the future,

208
00:10:57,970 --> 00:10:59,170
I will go visit you.

209
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:02,640
Brother,

210
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:05,140
please take care of Xuan Huan.

211
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:06,350
Don't worry.

212
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:09,690
Sir, Miss,

213
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:11,120
Mr. Lu is not in his room.

214
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:13,110
His sword, spear,

215
00:11:13,330 --> 00:11:14,310
and those three old books

216
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:15,810
are all gone.

217
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:28,210
Jerk.

218
00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:30,850
He left without me!

219
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:35,490
Lu Lingfeng did

220
00:11:35,530 --> 00:11:37,400
the right thing.

221
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:38,800
Brother,

222
00:11:39,290 --> 00:11:40,660
are you taking his side?

223
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:42,710
The path he chose is dangerous.

224
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,930
He doesn't want you

225
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:47,640
to suffer with him.

226
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:50,200
Lu Lingfeng.

227
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:54,570
Xijun, stop crying.

228
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:57,940
His choice proves

229
00:11:57,980 --> 00:11:59,540
that he's a mature man now,

230
00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:00,790
that he is able

231
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:02,830
to control his emotions.

232
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:04,830
You should be happy for him.

233
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:05,610
I believe

234
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:07,660
he won't give up on himself.

235
00:12:08,170 --> 00:12:08,710
Soon,

236
00:12:09,210 --> 00:12:11,090
we'll meet him again

237
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:12,840
out there somewhere.

238
00:12:14,370 --> 00:12:14,920
Sir,

239
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:16,390
did you mean that

240
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:17,820
Mr. Lu will come back?

241
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:19,670
All right.

242
00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:21,270
Stop asking questions.

243
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:23,590
Go wake Fed up.

244
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:24,570
We should set off now.

245
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:25,810
Okay.

246
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:39,060
He's long fallen in love with you.

247
00:12:39,590 --> 00:12:40,180
Don't worry.

248
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:43,400
You'll see him very soon.

249
00:12:45,330 --> 00:12:46,100
Well,

250
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:50,660
I want to take this opportunity

251
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:52,600
to let Prefectural Governor Xiong

252
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:55,140
have you escorted back to Chang'an.

253
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:59,940
The Imperial Inspector

254
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:02,300
from the capital

255
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:04,580
brought a message from your father.

256
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:06,340
He misses you.

257
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:09,750
I miss my father too,

258
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:12,710
but I'll stick with you!

259
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:14,550
Why?

260
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:16,250
Lu Lingfeng was expelled from Chang'an.

261
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:17,830
If I go back,

262
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,220
I may never

263
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,090
be able to meet him again.

264
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:21,780
But if I stay with you,

265
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:23,300
once he changes his mind,

266
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,190
he can come to find us in Ninghu.

267
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:33,860
Okay.

268
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:36,210
With you traveling with me,

269
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,570
the journey to Ninghu

270
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:39,210
won't be too boring.

271
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:40,790
Although I don't like

272
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:41,990
the Prefectural Governor of Ninghu,

273
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:43,880
it's said that Ninghu

274
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:44,770
is a very beautiful place.

275
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:47,100
You know

276
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:48,390
Prefectural Governor Li of Ninghu?

277
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:49,940
Why do you dislike him?

278
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:54,980
Forget it.

279
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:56,610
He has nothing to do with me.

280
00:13:57,350 --> 00:13:58,270
Fed disappeared too.

281
00:13:58,630 --> 00:13:59,620
Has he gone traveling around the world

282
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:00,890
with master?

283
00:14:01,050 --> 00:14:02,010
That's impossible.

284
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:04,800
Chicken Fed must have

285
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:07,080
heard of the good wine in Ninghu,

286
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:09,600
and set off before us.

287
00:14:09,810 --> 00:14:10,490
I'm sure of it.

288
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:32,040
[The suburb of Ninghu]

289
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,050
We'll arrive in Ninghu in no time

290
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:32,700
but it suddenly started raining cats and dos.

291
00:14:33,150 --> 00:14:34,170
We are so unlucky.

292
00:14:34,930 --> 00:14:36,800
Be careful not to slip and fall.

293
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:38,540
Yeah.

294
00:14:38,970 --> 00:14:40,110
It's too slippery.

295
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:47,340
What's that?

296
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:52,420
Nothing.

297
00:14:53,070 --> 00:14:54,290
Maybe

298
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,040
it's the monster

299
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:56,800
in the stories I told you just now.

300
00:14:58,150 --> 00:15:00,350
Brother, don't scare me.

301
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:01,660
Sir,

302
00:15:01,770 --> 00:15:02,750
tell us more stories.

303
00:15:03,010 --> 00:15:03,820
I love

304
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:04,830
scary stories.

305
00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:09,300
The ancients said that when crossing rivers and lakes,

306
00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:12,310
one must not leave his or her blood on the bushes.

307
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:13,220
Otherwise,

308
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:15,900
once it's licked by the Tuo living in the water,

309
00:15:16,490 --> 00:15:17,530
one will be possessed

310
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:19,600
by the soul of the Tuo,

311
00:15:20,610 --> 00:15:22,880
and he or she will be doomed.

312
00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:24,650
Tuo?

313
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:26,220
What's that?

314
00:15:26,970 --> 00:15:27,540
Tuo

315
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,260
means alligator.

316
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:31,250
According to historical records,

317
00:15:31,570 --> 00:15:34,240
Ninghu was once called Tuozhou, a place of crocodiles.

318
00:15:34,810 --> 00:15:35,650
I guess

319
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:37,830
there are many alligators here.

320
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,960
Brother, look.

321
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:46,250
There is a big temple ahead.

322
00:15:48,850 --> 00:15:49,710
Great!

323
00:15:50,210 --> 00:15:51,900
Let's take shelter there tonight.

324
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:53,230
We'll enter the city tomorrow.

325
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:53,860
Let's go.

326
00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:23,490
Xue Huan.

327
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:24,940
Let them go.

328
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:27,350
We're close to the lake.

329
00:16:27,850 --> 00:16:29,050
The horses might

330
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:30,420
have sensed something big in the lake.

331
00:16:30,830 --> 00:16:32,220
After the rain stops tomorrow,

332
00:16:32,350 --> 00:16:33,650
they will come back.

333
00:16:34,210 --> 00:16:35,410
What is it?

334
00:16:35,730 --> 00:16:36,940
I don't know.

335
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:38,590
Will it hurt us?

336
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:40,630
We'll be safe in the temple.

337
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:41,580
Let's go.

338
00:17:00,730 --> 00:17:01,320
Miss.

339
00:17:02,290 --> 00:17:02,890
Don't be afraid.

340
00:17:07,579 --> 00:17:08,579
Brother, you are knowledgeable.

341
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:11,280
Do you know

342
00:17:11,319 --> 00:17:12,250
which god is under the red cloth?

343
00:17:14,099 --> 00:17:15,859
I was in a hurry to take shelter

344
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:17,819
and didn't notice the name of the temple.

345
00:17:19,849 --> 00:17:21,589
This statue is weird.

346
00:17:21,619 --> 00:17:22,660
I can't tell what god it is either.

347
00:17:23,430 --> 00:17:24,510
This place

348
00:17:24,530 --> 00:17:25,480
is hair-raising.

349
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:27,359
Let's go somewhere else.

350
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:30,140
Our horses ran away in fear.

351
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:32,240
We can't go anywhere.

352
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,890
We have to stay here

353
00:17:34,230 --> 00:17:35,250
and wait for dawn.

354
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:37,200
Hurry! Hurry up!

355
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:38,430
Mr. Lu,

356
00:17:38,650 --> 00:17:39,670
what if someone is in the temple?

357
00:17:40,090 --> 00:17:40,890
Those worshipping the evil god

358
00:17:40,930 --> 00:17:41,730
must not be someone kind.

359
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:42,820
Kill whoever there may be.

360
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:43,510
Yes.

361
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:45,370
Xue Huan!

362
00:17:45,910 --> 00:17:46,990
We don't know who's coming.

363
00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:48,090
We should better hide ourselves.

364
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:48,700
This way.

365
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:50,230
Hurry up.

366
00:18:29,850 --> 00:18:30,920
There's no one in the temple.

367
00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:32,570
Good.

368
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:35,430
[Lu Yong, member of Ninghu Chamber of Commerce]

369
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:34,250
Burn it!

370
00:18:35,050 --> 00:18:36,860
Burn down the Temple of Tuo God.

371
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:57,630
Sure enough, you're the people from the Chamber of Commerce.

372
00:18:57,950 --> 00:18:58,550
Lu Yong.

373
00:18:58,970 --> 00:19:00,340
You broke into the Temple of Tuo God at night,

374
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:02,010
[Shen Chong, Chief of the Worshippers of Tuo God]

375
00:19:00,370 --> 00:19:01,470
and attempted to set it on fire.

376
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:02,980
Do you know how audacious you are?

377
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:04,120
Shen Chong,

378
00:19:05,330 --> 00:19:06,640
who are you to judge me?

379
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:08,740
I'll kill you tonight!

380
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:40,620
Mr. Lu,

381
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:44,250
we are outnumbered.

382
00:19:44,910 --> 00:19:45,620
Go!

383
00:19:46,090 --> 00:19:46,700
Retreat!

384
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:49,810
Hurry!

385
00:19:50,090 --> 00:19:50,920
Go after them!

386
00:19:54,450 --> 00:19:55,740
Chief Shen, please spare me.

387
00:19:55,810 --> 00:19:56,820
I'm sorry.

388
00:19:56,850 --> 00:19:57,810
Please spare my life.

389
00:19:59,060 --> 00:19:59,730
What about you?

390
00:20:00,130 --> 00:20:01,330
You Worshippers of Tuo God did all kinds of evil deeds.

391
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:03,020
The Temple of Tuo God should be burned to ashes!

392
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:06,210
You left me no choice then.

393
00:20:06,490 --> 00:20:07,700
Tie them up!

394
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:08,660
Throw them into the lake.

395
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:09,630
Feed them to the crocodiles!

396
00:20:10,930 --> 00:20:11,540
Spare me!

397
00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:12,970
Chief Shen, spare me!

398
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:13,700
Please spare me!

399
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:14,380
Chief Shen!

400
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,180
Please spare me.

401
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:30,360
Chief Shen, there seems to be someone else in the temple.

402
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:39,580
It must be Lu Yong's accomplices

403
00:20:40,050 --> 00:20:42,010
who plan to burn the temple after we leave.

404
00:20:43,390 --> 00:20:43,940
Leave no one alive.

405
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:44,560
Yes.

406
00:21:11,650 --> 00:21:14,210
Who's making all this noise?

407
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:20,970
Chief Shen,

408
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:22,230
we must have displeased

409
00:21:22,270 --> 00:21:23,070
Tuo God.

410
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:26,690
That voice...

411
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:28,350
Tuo God,

412
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:29,750
forgive us for disturbing you.

413
00:21:42,490 --> 00:21:43,450
Tuo God,

414
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:46,270
I've driven away those

415
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:48,170
who intended to destroy the temple.

416
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,130
Good.

417
00:21:51,390 --> 00:21:56,310
It's a stormy night. I should rest earlier.

418
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:57,660
You may

419
00:21:58,530 --> 00:21:59,960
take your leave.

420
00:22:09,570 --> 00:22:12,760
What's detaining you?

421
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:16,180
Sorry.

422
00:22:16,470 --> 00:22:17,330
My apologies.

423
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:19,050
We're leaving now.

424
00:22:19,570 --> 00:22:20,270
Hurry. Let's go.

425
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:21,910
Go. Go.

426
00:22:36,150 --> 00:22:38,450
[Temple of Tuo God]

427
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:49,550
Tuo God?

428
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:55,080
The god of alligators?

429
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,470
Why does anyone worship that?

430
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:00,100
Miss.

431
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:03,920
Who are you?

432
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:07,810
Who are you?

433
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:10,390
You're good at hocus-pocus.

434
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:11,890
Watch your mouth!

435
00:23:12,010 --> 00:23:13,140
How dare you to be so rude to him?

436
00:23:13,890 --> 00:23:14,820
Look at you.

437
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:15,820
You are just a boy but are brandishing a sword.

438
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:17,630
I don't think you three

439
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:19,510
are thieves.

440
00:23:20,850 --> 00:23:22,100
Who are you calling a thief?

441
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:23,870
-My master is... -Xue Huan.

442
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:28,660
Miss,

443
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:31,340
I think you are hiding from

444
00:23:31,450 --> 00:23:33,450
one of the two groups.

445
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:36,510
They won't be back for the time being.

446
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:38,640
It's safe for you to go out now.

447
00:23:40,610 --> 00:23:41,790
I know that.

448
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:43,990
I don't need you to tell me.

449
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:49,440
How rude.

450
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:52,520
She's more like a thief.

451
00:23:53,410 --> 00:23:53,980
Alright.

452
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:56,850
Let's go.

453
00:23:57,140 --> 00:23:59,640
We were in the rain for nights entering the city.

454
00:24:06,130 --> 00:24:07,810
Xue Huan, you must be tired.

455
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,620
Let me carry it for you.

456
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:11,090
No way.

457
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:13,190
You are the new Military Commander.

458
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:15,180
How can you carry it yourself?

459
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:16,350
Why not?

460
00:24:17,170 --> 00:24:17,570
Take it.

461
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:19,410
Hurry up.

462
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:28,120
Tuo God is here.

463
00:24:28,610 --> 00:24:29,200
Tuo God!

464
00:24:29,330 --> 00:24:30,010
Hurry up.

465
00:24:30,030 --> 00:24:31,070
Have a look at Tuo God.

466
00:24:31,730 --> 00:24:32,610
Tuo God is here.

467
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:33,920

Get out of the way!

00:24:36,310 --> 00:24:37,900
Move! Move!

472
00:24:39,540 --> 00:24:41,740

God bless us!

475
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:46,970
God bless us!

476
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:49,020
God bless us!

477

God bless us!

480
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:57,690
Who are you? Why didn't you kneel?

481
00:24:58,350 --> 00:24:59,800
This is the new Military Commander, Commander Su.

482
00:25:01,890 --> 00:25:03,600
Can the new Military Commander

483
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:06,150
avoid from kneeling?

484
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:07,830
Not to mention a Military Commander,

485
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:09,700
even if the Prefectural Governor meets Tuo God,

486
00:25:09,810 --> 00:25:10,770
he still needs to kneel.

487
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:11,380
Yes.

488
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:11,850
That's right.

489
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:12,670
A Military Commander is nothing.

490
00:25:12,950 --> 00:25:13,750
If you offend Tuo God,

491
00:25:13,810 --> 00:25:15,250
the people will suffer.

492
00:25:15,310 --> 00:25:16,670
Kneel down.

493
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:17,470
Kneel!

494
00:25:17,630 --> 00:25:18,510
-Yes. -You…

495
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:19,420
Kneel down.

496
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:20,000
Xue Huan.

497
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:22,140
You can't offend Tuo God.

498
00:25:22,170 --> 00:25:23,670
You can't offend the mighty Tuo God.

499
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:24,620
Kneel down.

500
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:25,460
Brother.

501
00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:27,220
This place is weird.

502
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:28,820
We can't afford to suffer losses now.

503
00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:31,660
He doesn't look like a Military Commander,

504
00:25:31,950 --> 00:25:33,120
but a teacher instead.

505
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:33,740
Look.

506
00:25:33,970 --> 00:25:35,340
He's carrying his own bag.

507
00:25:36,170 --> 00:25:37,080
What are you looking at?

508
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:38,360
Kneel!

509
00:25:38,850 --> 00:25:39,450
Chief Shen.

510
00:25:43,190 --> 00:25:44,630
Please calm down.

511
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:48,680
Greetings, Administrator Gu.

512
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:49,800

513
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:52,380

Chief Shen.

517
00:25:56,410 --> 00:25:58,240
Commander Su has just arrived at Ninghu.

518
00:25:58,690 --> 00:25:59,960
He must not know the customs.

519
00:26:00,570 --> 00:26:01,490
When he gets familiar with it,

520
00:26:01,890 --> 00:26:03,620
he will worship Tuo God.

521
00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:06,080
As for today,

522
00:26:06,110 --> 00:26:08,440
do you mind excusing him?

523
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:09,890
I wonder if Chief Shen would

524

I should meet the Prefectural Governor immediately.

547
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:23,850
Fine.

I'll take my leave then.

The chief of the Worshippers of Tuo God, Shen Chong

551
00:27:35,630 --> 00:27:37,030
might seem a bit domineering,

552
00:27:37,930 --> 00:27:39,260
but he has done a lot of things

553
00:27:39,450 --> 00:27:40,570
for this city.

554

Take taxes as an example.

555
00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:44,190
During the collection period every year,

556
00:27:44,390 --> 00:27:46,600
there's no need to send anyone to urge the people to pay.

557
00:27:47,110 --> 00:27:49,230
The Worshippers of Tuo God will help to collect the taxes

558
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:51,370
from the merchants and the people.

559
00:27:51,990 --> 00:27:53,020
No one dares to deny.

560
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:55,520
Therefore, every former Prefectural Governor

561
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,070
respected the Worshippers of Tuo God.

562
00:27:57,420 --> 00:27:58,530
Besides,

563
00:27:58,710 --> 00:28:00,910
Tuo God can bless the weather in Ninghu,

564
00:28:01,250 --> 00:28:02,410
and make our city prosperous.

565
00:28:03,070 --> 00:28:04,420
That's all thanks to Tuo God.

This mansion

568

was built by the Worshippers of Tuo God many years ago,

569
00:28:18,770 --> 00:28:19,880
and was gifted to the government.

570
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:23,250
Later, it became the shelter

He's a mute.

575
00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:37,780
I once suggested the Prefectural Governor

576
00:28:37,970 --> 00:28:39,600
to hire someone who can speak to serve him.

577
00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:41,860
But he has a strong bond with his old servant.

578

Is the Prefectural Governor here?

The Prefectural Governor lives here

to focus on the public affair.

590
00:29:21,090 --> 00:29:22,900
He never asked anyone to disturb him.

591

Even for his meals,

592
00:29:24,930 --> 00:29:27,320
he just asked Li Si to place them on the window.

this is the new Military Commander, Commander Su.

is not as big as the one in Nanzhou.

No. No.

630
00:32:06,060 --> 00:32:07,140

Why? Did you spend all your money again?

635

It's not about money at all.

636

The Tuo God Wine was initially known as the Nantian Wine.

00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:13,130
It's not impossible to try it.

695
00:35:13,470 --> 00:35:15,140
On the Double Third Festival, 3rd day of March every year,

696
00:35:15,590 --> 00:35:17,070
Tuo God will make his appearance on his birthday.

697
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:18,160
There will be a God Sighting Ceremony

698
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:19,730
held on the Island of Tuo God.

699
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:21,230
The people who go to the island

700
00:35:21,250 --> 00:35:22,210
will have a chance to drink it.

701
00:35:22,660 --> 00:35:24,370
You are the Military Commander, a high-ranking official.

702
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:26,240
You will definitely be invited to the island.

703
00:35:26,850 --> 00:35:28,320
But Commander wants to drink it now.

704
00:35:29,130 --> 00:35:29,940
No way.

705
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:32,320
If we offend Tuo God,

706
00:35:32,690 --> 00:35:33,330
it will be terrible.

707
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:35,130
The people in the city

708
00:35:35,370 --> 00:35:37,550
enjoying the fine wine in the city,

709
00:35:37,820 --> 00:35:39,980
that's nothing wrong.

710
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:42,680
If the so-called Tuo God tried to have it all to himself,

711
00:35:43,230 --> 00:35:44,270
I'm afraid

712
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:46,740
he can't be called a god.

713
00:35:47,590 --> 00:35:48,220
Don't talk nonsense!

714
00:35:48,750 --> 00:35:50,350
If the Worshippers of Tuo God heard you,

715
00:35:50,750 --> 00:35:52,060
I'd be implicated.

716
00:35:53,910 --> 00:35:55,550
You guys worship Tuo God so much,

717
00:35:55,830 --> 00:35:57,710
and even have some sort of God Sighting Ceremony.

718
00:35:57,770 --> 00:35:58,530
Let me ask you.

719
00:35:58,870 --> 00:36:00,250
Have you seen Tuo God with your own eyes?

720
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:01,590
I...

721
00:36:02,310 --> 00:36:03,670
I'm not that lucky.

722
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:06,850
But my master has seen him before.

723
00:36:06,950 --> 00:36:07,890
Call him here.

724
00:36:09,090 --> 00:36:09,760
Go.

725
00:36:12,790 --> 00:36:14,630
What's so special about seeing Tuo God?

726
00:36:14,470 --> 00:36:16,850
[The owner of Yaoyue Restaurant]

727
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:16,580
On the Double Third Festival every year,

728
00:36:16,650 --> 00:36:18,450
when I carried the wine to the island,

729
00:36:18,630 --> 00:36:19,830
Tuo God would

730
00:36:19,990 --> 00:36:22,310
show himself of his several feet high body.

731
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:24,660
He would also talk to the officials

732
00:36:24,770 --> 00:36:25,890
and the people who came to the island.

733
00:36:26,130 --> 00:36:29,180
There has always been this Tuo God in Ninghu?

734
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:30,090
Of course.

735
00:36:30,850 --> 00:36:32,140
Tuo God is there since the Later Han Dynasty.

736
00:36:32,570 --> 00:36:34,570
But it was 30 years ago that

737
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:35,600
Tuo God

738
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:37,160
made his first appearance.

739
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:39,420
Fine.

740
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:41,180
Tuo God will make his appearance.

741
00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:42,380
I believe you.

742
00:36:42,620 --> 00:36:43,540
I'll go to

743
00:36:43,580 --> 00:36:45,360
the Temple of Tuo God to burn some incense later, okay?

744
00:36:47,490 --> 00:36:49,530
You're the one who opened the Yaoyue Restaurant.

745
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:51,220
You must have a way

746
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:52,310
to let Commander Su

747
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:53,500
to have a try of that wine.

748
00:36:53,980 --> 00:36:55,020
Commander Su once

749
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:56,470
worked as an official in the capital.

750
00:36:56,530 --> 00:36:57,660
Money is no big deal.

751
00:36:57,910 --> 00:36:59,430
This is no joke.

752
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:01,630
If I sell it to you in private,

753
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:03,400
I'll lose my life.

754
00:37:03,740 --> 00:37:05,830
You are a government official.

755
00:37:06,530 --> 00:37:08,410
The Worshippers of Tuo God is so domineering.

756
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:10,120
It's intolerable.

757
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:12,680
After all, this is not about wine.

758
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:14,320
This is about the dignity of the imperial court,

759
00:37:14,490 --> 00:37:15,190
and the prestige of the government.

760
00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:16,260
I beg you.

761
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:18,740
Please give me a few more days.

762
00:37:18,860 --> 00:37:19,960
Please.

763
00:37:19,990 --> 00:37:21,560
-You said the business was bad three months ago. -I beg you.

764
00:37:21,590 --> 00:37:22,190
Please.

765
00:37:22,220 --> 00:37:23,370
Not only did I show leniency,

766
00:37:23,510 --> 00:37:24,540
I also lent you money.

767
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:25,260
Now,

768
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:27,090
you can't even pay back the money you borrowed.

769
00:37:27,370 --> 00:37:29,400
How can I explain to the Worshippers of Tuo God?

770
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:31,280
The interest is too high.

771
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:32,040
What did you say?

772
00:37:32,170 --> 00:37:34,230
I was wrong.

773
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:35,500
The inn is not doing well recently.

774
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:37,160
Please give us a few more days.

775
00:37:37,190 --> 00:37:40,180
[Owner of Lin Inn]

776
00:37:38,050 --> 00:37:39,380
I'll pay you back

777
00:37:39,410 --> 00:37:41,380
no matter what it takes.

778
00:37:41,410 --> 00:37:44,210
I think you're disrespecting Tuo God.

779
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:45,500
No!

780
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:48,520
Who are you?

781
00:37:49,270 --> 00:37:50,380
No matter who I am,

782
00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:53,190
I can't just stand aside and watch you

783
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:54,260
bullying the people.

784
00:37:54,420 --> 00:37:56,030
Do you want to fight the Worshippers of Tuo God?

785
00:37:56,820 --> 00:37:58,060
How dare you!

786
00:37:58,510 --> 00:37:59,540
Let me tell you.

787
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:02,160
This is the new Military Commander of Ninghu,

788
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:04,700
the famous Su Wuming.

789
00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:05,780
He's new.

790
00:38:05,980 --> 00:38:07,050
We are not clear about his background.

791
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:09,500
Since Commander has pleaded for him,

792
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:11,010
I'll give him three more days.

793
00:38:11,390 --> 00:38:11,810
Let's go.

794
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:18,850
I can't believe

795
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:20,660
that there is this group of people

796
00:38:20,690 --> 00:38:22,540
who are running amok in this world!

797
00:38:22,830 --> 00:38:24,920
Where is the dignity of Tang?

798
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:27,020
Commander,

799
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:29,350
don't talk nonsense in my house.

800
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:31,960
Tuo God is almighty.

801
00:38:32,450 --> 00:38:33,960
If he heard those words,

802
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:34,350
I...

803
00:38:34,990 --> 00:38:37,020
I will be implicated.

804
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:38,640
Look at him.

805
00:38:38,970 --> 00:38:41,090
I told you that he would speak for Tuo God.

806
00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:43,430
I had a nephew from Qiantang.

807
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:45,530
He moved here and opened a rice store last year.

808
00:38:45,810 --> 00:38:46,800
He was stubborn

809
00:38:47,290 --> 00:38:48,460
and refused to pay money to the Worshippers of Tuo God,

810
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:50,040
and refused to pay for the donations to the temple.

811
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:51,640
He didn't listen to me when I scolded him.

812
00:38:52,860 --> 00:38:53,410
In the end,

813
00:38:54,930 --> 00:38:56,260
he lost his life.

814
00:38:56,620 --> 00:38:57,940
Life is at stake.

815
00:38:58,040 --> 00:38:59,150
The country has its laws.

816
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:01,440
How can the Worshippers of Tuo God decide life and death?

817
00:39:01,690 --> 00:39:02,610
The law?

818
00:39:02,910 --> 00:39:04,070
It is set by people,

819
00:39:04,180 --> 00:39:05,390
and used to restrict people.

820
00:39:05,610 --> 00:39:08,210
But Tuo God is a god.

821
00:39:11,590 --> 00:39:14,780
The temple donations

822
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:16,840
and the fees to the Worshippers of Tuo God you mentioned earlier,

823
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:18,730
what are those things?

824
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:21,400
In Ninghu, as long as you do business,

825
00:39:21,670 --> 00:39:24,640
you're automatically a member of the Worshippers of Tuo God.

826
00:39:24,850 --> 00:39:27,000
You have to pay the fees once a month.

827
00:39:27,380 --> 00:39:28,460
As for the temple donations,

828
00:39:28,710 --> 00:39:30,960
it depends on how much you earn a year.

829
00:39:31,430 --> 00:39:34,070
It will be 30% of the money you've earned.

830
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:36,160
Isn't this robbing?

831
00:39:36,220 --> 00:39:37,060
Isn't there anyone who tried to rebel?

832
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:38,080
Rebel?

833
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:39,510
Well...

834
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:41,100
Don't you want the weather to be good?

835
00:39:41,510 --> 00:39:42,670
Don't you want to have a good harvest?

836
00:39:44,180 --> 00:39:46,790
We can't do anything against our conscience.

837
00:39:48,010 --> 00:39:48,970
I don't understand.

838
00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:51,540
Why do people in Ninghu

839
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:54,820
all believe in Tuo God?

840
00:39:57,030 --> 00:39:58,330
In the Later Han Dynasty,

841
00:39:59,580 --> 00:40:00,780
there was a big flood

842
00:40:00,810 --> 00:40:02,900
in Ninghu.

843
00:40:03,930 --> 00:40:06,770
Some people survived the flood,

844
00:40:07,170 --> 00:40:08,860
because they climbed

845
00:40:08,890 --> 00:40:10,320
on the back of a giant alligator.

846
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:13,630
So since then,

847
00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:17,180
people in Ninghu have been treating it as a god.

848
00:40:17,290 --> 00:40:18,740
No wonder.

849
00:40:19,150 --> 00:40:20,330
So Tuo God

850
00:40:20,350 --> 00:40:21,990
was your life saviour.

851
00:40:22,230 --> 00:40:23,010
Of course.

852
00:40:23,630 --> 00:40:26,590
We can't be ungrateful.

853
00:40:28,940 --> 00:40:29,730
Sir,

854
00:40:30,110 --> 00:40:32,910
have you seen Tuo God?

855
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:33,900
Yes.

856
00:40:34,220 --> 00:40:35,100
Three years ago,

857
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:38,820
my business was good that year.

858
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:41,620
I paid a lot of temple donations.

859
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:43,880
I didn't expect that during the Double Third Festival,

860
00:40:44,140 --> 00:40:45,810
I was chosen

861
00:40:45,850 --> 00:40:47,130
to go to the island.

862
00:40:49,970 --> 00:40:51,510
The Ninghu officials and I,

863
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:53,560
along with some common people who were as lucky as I was,

864
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:55,770
together saw

865
00:40:55,900 --> 00:40:58,180
the real appearance of Tuo God.

866
00:40:58,510 --> 00:41:00,900
I was so excited

867
00:41:00,930 --> 00:41:02,750
that I cried.

868
00:41:04,890 --> 00:41:05,410
Su Wuming.

869
00:41:05,980 --> 00:41:08,230
Why don't we go to the island

870
00:41:08,530 --> 00:41:09,420
to see

871
00:41:11,330 --> 00:41:12,180
Tuo God too?

872
00:41:12,510 --> 00:41:14,280
Do you think you can see him whenever you want?

873
00:41:15,970 --> 00:41:17,550
Apart from the Double Third Festival,

874
00:41:17,990 --> 00:41:20,150
if you go to the island without permission,

875
00:41:20,890 --> 00:41:22,290
you will be thrown into

876
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:23,920
the Swamp of Alligators.

877
00:41:26,250 --> 00:41:27,980
Swamp of Alligators?

878
00:41:28,510 --> 00:41:30,350
The descendants of Tuo God

879
00:41:30,890 --> 00:41:32,530
are waiting with their heads up in the swamp.

880
00:41:32,870 --> 00:41:34,840
They will only eat those

881
00:41:34,860 --> 00:41:36,630
who disrespect Tuo God and disobey his will.

882
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:38,930
And so my nephew died in there.

883
00:41:43,850 --> 00:41:46,060
But in Ninghu,

884
00:41:46,430 --> 00:41:48,110
there are also people who disrespect Tuo God.

885
00:41:49,420 --> 00:41:50,190
For example,

886
00:41:51,070 --> 00:41:52,760
Mr. Lu of the Chamber of Commerce.

887
00:41:54,010 --> 00:41:55,470
You are indeed from the Chamber of Commerce.

888
00:41:55,710 --> 00:41:56,350
Lu Yong.

889
00:41:56,690 --> 00:41:58,000
You broke into the temple at night

890
00:41:58,030 --> 00:41:59,180
and attempted to set a fire.

891
00:41:59,370 --> 00:42:00,240
Do you admit your crime?

892
00:42:01,850 --> 00:42:02,660
Lu Yong?

893
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:04,550
Yes, that's him.

894
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:07,910
He is flagrantly against the Tuo God.

895
00:42:09,740 --> 00:42:11,980
I think his life

896
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:13,860
will end soon.

897
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:17,010
Greetings, Administrator.

898
00:42:19,410 --> 00:42:20,090
Lu Yong,

899
00:42:20,610 --> 00:42:22,340
I don't know you.

900
00:42:22,990 --> 00:42:24,430
Why are you here?

901
00:42:24,700 --> 00:42:25,180
Administrator,

902
00:42:25,850 --> 00:42:26,690
I can only count on you

903
00:42:27,490 --> 00:42:29,040
for this matter.

904
00:42:31,620 --> 00:42:32,850
I got this by chance.

905
00:42:33,690 --> 00:42:34,240
Administrator.

906
00:42:39,620 --> 00:42:41,190
[Records of Worshippers of Tuo God]

907
00:42:40,070 --> 00:42:41,710
Records of Worshippers of Tuo God?

908
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:43,310
Although there's no author's name,

909
00:42:43,770 --> 00:42:44,520
it records

910
00:42:44,550 --> 00:42:46,110
all the crimes of the Worshippers of Tuo God.

911
00:42:46,580 --> 00:42:48,400
It's not a false statement.

912
00:42:48,430 --> 00:42:49,380
Everything is reasonable and backed by evidence.

913
00:42:54,860 --> 00:42:56,060
I also heard

914
00:42:57,100 --> 00:42:59,340
that you've gathered some people in the Chamber of Commerce

915
00:42:59,580 --> 00:43:01,270
to fight against the Worshippers of Tuo God.

916
00:43:02,050 --> 00:43:03,630
But respecting Tuo God

917
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:05,360
and supporting the Worshippers of Tuo God

918
00:43:05,930 --> 00:43:08,440
are the traditions of this city for years.

919
00:43:08,650 --> 00:43:09,230
Administrator Gu,

920
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:11,530
take a good look at this file.

921
00:43:11,990 --> 00:43:13,310
You will then know how many evil things they have done

922
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:15,210
in the name of Tuo God.

923
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:18,420
You are an official of our city.

924
00:43:18,650 --> 00:43:20,510
For the people, I would like to ask for your help.
