[Episode 2]

4
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:50,289
Young, young Master!

5
00:01:50,539 --> 00:01:51,220
Somebody!

6
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:54,570
My son.

7
00:01:54,610 --> 00:01:55,300
-Master. -My son.

8
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:56,220
Master.

9
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,759
Help him out first.

10
00:01:59,259 --> 00:02:00,710
And don't let the madam in, either.

11
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:01,060
Yes.

12
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:02,340
Slowly.

13
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:03,430
Slowly.

14
00:02:21,329 --> 00:02:22,410
He had porridge this morning.

15
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:24,579
So the murderer should not have left for long.

16
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:26,010
Guo Zhuang, go after him!

17
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:26,550
Yes.

18
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:32,900
You also noticed

19
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:34,320
that he didn't kill himself?

20
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:37,470
For a person who hung himself

21
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:38,900
his eyes would be shut and his mouth would be open.

22
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:40,740
If the rope was hung around his throat,

23
00:02:41,579 --> 00:02:42,540
his tongue would be against his teeth.

24
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:43,640
If the rope was stuck under the throat,

25
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:45,020
his tongue would stick out.

26
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:45,680
And he...

27
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:47,720
Hands, too.

28
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:49,950
Those who commit suicide

29
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:52,550
should have their hands clenched, while he...

30
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:55,200
Judging from his look,

31
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:56,240
he should have been throttled first

32
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:57,430
and then hung up.

33
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:01,170
Wu.

34
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:02,260
Ask the Dou family

35
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:03,300
to come out for questioning.

36
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:04,020
Yes.

37
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:09,620
Where is the groom?

38
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,040
Here.

39
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:12,220
The horse

40
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:13,710
was chosen by the young master himself.

41
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:14,870
He even fed the horse himself

42
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:16,940
and sent the bride in person.

43
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:18,700
It has nothing to do with me.

44
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:19,840
So,

45
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,410
you have see something?

46
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:24,650
That day,

47
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:27,890
I went to feed the horses

48
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,280
as usual.

49
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:31,250
I found the young master was adding something to the barrel

50
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,700
for the horse to drink.

51
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:35,130
I dared not ask more.

52
00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:44,650
Did Dou Yulin

53
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,070
act

54
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:48,060
weird these days?

55
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:49,870
On the day young miss went missing,

56
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:51,370
he came back at midnight

57
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:53,120
and got drunk.

58
00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:00,080
Young Master.

59
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:01,520
Why are you home so late?

60
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:02,620
And you're drunk.

61
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:03,170
Move.

62
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:08,320
What's wrong?

63
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:11,800
Where exactly did it go wrong?

64
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:14,020
What happened after that?

65
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:15,420
Had he ever left the house?

66
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:17,140
Where had he been and who had he met?

67
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:18,940
Young master was a good man.

68
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:20,779
He was a very good man.

69
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:38,100
Did you find anything?

70
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:39,140
General.

71
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:40,330
On the wall of the backyard,

72
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,400
there were some crushed tiles.

73
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:42,980
The murderer has disappeared long ago.

74
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:51,150
Aren't you leaving?

75
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:54,300
General, you go first.

76
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:55,790
I have something else to do.

77
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:00,260
What's the name of the little girl

78
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:01,900
on the left of the front row?

79
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:04,340
Ling'er.

80
00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:10,170
Sheriff.

81
00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:15,560
You can leave now.

82
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:19,920
You must be Ling'er.

83
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:22,980
My name is Su Wuming.

84
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:25,070
I'm the sheriff of Chang'an.

85
00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:28,340
Do you have anything to say to me?

86
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:30,510
I'm sure

87
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:31,970
young master was killed by Yin Shilang.

88
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,150
Please sheriff, you have to avenge him!

89
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:36,360
Yin Shilang!

90
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,250
Yin Shilang!

91
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:45,730
That bride's younger brother...

92
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:47,700
Thank you for reminding me in time.

93
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:48,990
I just finished my business

94
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:50,100
and the Imperial Guards arrived.

95
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:51,310
That was close.

96
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:53,780
That fool looked down on his future brother-in-law,

97
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:55,420
so he asked me to help him kidnap his sister.

98
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:56,380
He would never have thought

99
00:05:56,409 --> 00:05:57,710
that we just needed a bride.

100
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:59,500
To choose a bride,

101
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:02,530
the old way is safer.

102
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:03,690
Yes.

103
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:05,490
You're in trouble.

104
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:08,190
The General of the Imperial Guards, Lu Lingfeng,

105
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:09,650
is the trusted aide of the Crown Prince.

106
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:10,800
Recently,

107
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:12,590
he has got his eyes on Chang'an black tea.

108
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:14,840
You must be careful of him.

109
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:18,230
He is just a nobody.

110
00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:19,220
Immortal Venerable,

111
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:21,590
you overestimated him.

112
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:23,420
You're really something.

113
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:25,440
You could tell that maid

114
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:26,780
had an affair with Dou Yulin.

115
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:28,570
Dou Yulin already knew

116
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,730
Song Chai is a gambler.

117
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:31,850
He didn't want his sister to jump into this fire pit.

118
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:33,190
But Dou Cong

119
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:34,960
insisted on fulfilling the engagement.

120
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:36,409
With no other choice

121
00:06:36,570 --> 00:06:38,010
Dou Yulin found out

122
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:39,260
there's a man in the Ghost Market

123
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,270
called Yin Shilang who is capable of anything.

124
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:43,420
So he took a lot of money with him to ask him for help.

125
00:06:43,890 --> 00:06:44,720
This Yin Shilang

126
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:45,580
took the money.

127
00:06:46,159 --> 00:06:47,650
However, he abducted and killed Dou Cong.

128
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:50,310
Then he killed Dou Yulin to silence him.

129
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:51,950
We can only say

130
00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:54,500
Yin Shilang is the prime suspect.

131
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:55,940
To investigate the case,

132
00:06:56,010 --> 00:06:58,540
before the truth is revealed,

133
00:06:58,570 --> 00:06:59,710
the last thing you should do is

134
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:01,530
jump to a conclusion.

135
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:05,450
It seems that we must go to the Ghost Market.

136
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,440
The Ghost Market is full of all sorts of bad characters.

137
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:10,420
Dangers lurk on every side of it.

138
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,490
You're just a scholar.

139
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:14,340
Do you have the guts?

140
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:16,230
What are you talking about?

141
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:18,990
I'm the sheriff of this county.

142
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:19,970
I have

143
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:21,570
some elite and tough soldiers under my command.

144
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:23,340
It's just a market.

145
00:07:23,730 --> 00:07:25,510
Why wouldn't I dare to go?

146
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:45,420
Sir,

147
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:48,140
my wife is going to give birth soon.

148

[Constable of Chang'an County, Jia]

149
00:07:48,290 --> 00:07:49,180
She had a difficult labor last time,

150
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:50,140
and almost lost her life.

151
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:52,250
I've hired the best delivery lady.

152
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:54,130
I have to stay at home.

153

[Constable of Chang'an County, Luo]

154
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:01,380
I have poor eyesight.

155
00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:02,030
At night,

156
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:03,030
I can't see anything.

157
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:04,010
Sheriff Su.

158
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:07,540
I, I...

159
00:08:06,450 --> 00:08:08,700
[Constable of Chang'an County, Liu]

160
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:08,820
I don't dare to go.

161
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:10,580
You don't dare?

162
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:15,350
You don't even try to come up with an excuse?

163
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:18,100
To be honest,

164
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:19,390
Sheriff Wu once took us

165
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:21,320
to the Ghost Market many times to track the fugitive,

166
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:22,570
and killed

167
00:08:22,590 --> 00:08:23,670
several outlaws there.

168
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:25,370
But not long after we came back,

169
00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:27,540
Sheriff Wu started acting like he was bewitched.

170
00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:29,660
And you knew what happened to him in the end.

171
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:38,740
So

172
00:08:38,770 --> 00:08:40,409
none of you is willing to go with me?

173
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,030
I'm just asking.

174
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,480
That kind of place,

175
00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:48,140
I won't go either.

176
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:08,140
What are you doing?

177
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:12,650
Come and give me a hand.

178
00:09:15,710 --> 00:09:16,910
He killed someone,

179
00:09:18,170 --> 00:09:19,820
and used spices

180
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:23,300
to make the dead body not decay.

181
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:29,560
This is so strange.

182
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:34,620
We're going to the Ghost Market anyway.

183
00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:37,300
So we can also look for

184
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,890
the source of this spice there.

185
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:42,040
You want to go to the Ghost Market?

186
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:43,300
How many people will you take with you?

187
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,240
No one.

188
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,630
I'll go alone.

189
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:52,980
Sheriff.

190
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:54,910
Why are you here?

191
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,730
I heard there are often ghosts here.

192
00:09:57,940 --> 00:09:59,400
I'm worried about you.

193
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:04,020
There are no ghosts and demons in this world.

194
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:07,080
Chang'an is designed by Yuwen Kai of the last dynasty, Sui,

195
00:10:07,130 --> 00:10:09,220
who took into account the six high hillsides in the city

196
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:11,540
and used the Qian Diagram

197
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:12,320
from the Eight Diagrams.

198
00:10:12,770 --> 00:10:13,670
The position of Nine-Two

199
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:15,590
is the Imperial Palace where the Emperor lives,

200
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:17,790
Nine-Three is the Imperial Court

201
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:19,680
where the officials is on duty.

202
00:10:20,090 --> 00:10:22,440
And the sovereign Nine-Five is

203
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:24,130
where the Xuandu Temple is built

204
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:25,780
along with Xingshan Temple.

205
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:27,820
But in the last years of the Sui dynasty

206
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:29,760
the depression next to Xuandu Temple

207
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:30,860
began to sink ever lower,

208
00:10:30,890 --> 00:10:32,770
and became an underground world.

209
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:34,600
Since our Tang dynasty,

210
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:35,910
the curfew has been tight.

211
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:37,650
Some homeless people

212
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:39,940
and those who do small business at night

213
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:41,570
have gathered here.

214
00:10:41,810 --> 00:10:43,740
So it gains its name, the Ghost Market.

215
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:47,020
Move!

216
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:00,370
Sheriff.

217
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:02,140
I heard

218
00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:04,100
there are many fugitives,

219
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:05,830
killers, robbers,

220
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:07,420
and the most vicious people here.

221
00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:09,350
You can't be too careful.

222
00:11:10,930 --> 00:11:12,280
There's nothing to be afraid of.

223
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:14,000
When I followed

224
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:15,510
my teacher, Detective Di,

225
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:16,780
we came here many times.

226
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:43,220
Get him!

227

You steal my chicken every day.

244

I'll chop off your hands.

This person is a ghost.

248

Let's go, go.

249
00:12:29,210 --> 00:12:29,700
Sheriff.

250
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,000
Are you alright?

251
00:12:31,770 --> 00:12:32,250
I'm fine.

252
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:34,360
What did he shout?

253
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:36,360
Ghost.

254
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:55,500
Chang'an black tea.

255
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:02,340
How much for the black tea?

256
00:13:02,890 --> 00:13:03,530
How much?

257
00:13:05,930 --> 00:13:07,270
I'm here to buy it.

258
00:13:07,690 --> 00:13:08,450
If you have it,

259
00:13:08,650 --> 00:13:10,210
I'm willing to buy it with silver,

260
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:12,470
or even gold.

261
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:13,260
I really don't have the tea.

262
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:15,790
Sir,

263
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:17,260
you mean

264
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:19,780
you bought the Chang'an black tea before.

265
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:20,710
Is it good?

266
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:22,900
How can I afford it?

267
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:24,990
I bought it and resold it in the East Market.

268
00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:27,650
It's an easy business, right?

269
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:28,830
It depends on

270
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:29,850
whether you can get your hands on the authentic goods.

271
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:31,550
The rich and the noble like this tea.

272
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:33,470
The price is high.

273
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:37,400
Take him.

274
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:38,260

No way.

281
00:13:57,740 --> 00:13:58,820
I'll go in before you.

282
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:12,420

How could you say that?

As the sheriff of Chang'an,

318
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,520
it's fine that you can't catch the murderer,

319

but you ruin the trap

Is sheriff also a government official?

348

You're worse than a cat. A cat can catch rats.

00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:45,260
This...

351
00:16:47,130 --> 00:16:47,650
Tiger?

352
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:49,940
Nonsense.

353
00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:51,550
How can there be a tiger here?

354
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:55,430
It looks like...

355
00:16:55,610 --> 00:16:56,590
It's really a tiger.

356
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:33,720
Don't jump out of the window.

357
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:40,540
General of the Imperial Guards.

358
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:42,620
What are you waiting for?

359
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:45,400
Kill the tiger with that sword!

360
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,800
The Lu family of Fanyang

361
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:52,940
has been a distinguished family for 500 years.

362
00:18:53,530 --> 00:18:54,440
Lu Lingfeng,

363
00:18:54,950 --> 00:18:57,420
you're such a disgrace to your ancestors.

364
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:32,330
Where is the tiger?

365
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:34,620
There's no tiger.

366
00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:36,330
But we saw it just now.

367
00:19:38,090 --> 00:19:39,670
Look at what's on the floor.

368
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:42,310
It's clearly some pieces of

369
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:44,020
tiger fur.

370
00:19:44,370 --> 00:19:45,620
It's just an illusion.

371
00:19:46,850 --> 00:19:47,600
Illusion?

372
00:19:58,800 --> 00:19:59,570
Su Wuming.

373
00:20:00,390 --> 00:20:01,490
How did you know?

374
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:04,100
Have you ever heard of such a giant tiger

375
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:05,800
in this world?

376
00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:07,290
If there was,

377
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:08,760
the bones and skeletons in the Ghost Market

378
00:20:08,830 --> 00:20:10,480
would be piled up.

379
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:12,220
How can you even see a living person?

380
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:16,860
I'm the General of the Imperial Guards.

381
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,970
I actually was deceived by an illusion.

382
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,000
Go get Wu

383
00:20:25,030 --> 00:20:25,980
and the tea sellers back.

384
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:26,460
Yes.

385
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:27,090
Wait.

386
00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:30,260
General.

387
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:31,340
The reason

388
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:32,490
why I didn't let you jump out of the window

389
00:20:32,530 --> 00:20:33,290
is that

390
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:38,260
the two people who jumped out of the window

391
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:40,040
might be dead.

392
00:20:41,690 --> 00:20:42,330
What did you say?

393
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:44,190
The enchanter wants

394
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:45,230
to force you

395
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:46,370
to jump out of the window with the illusion.

396
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:16,490
Wu!

397
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:23,940
Someone must be controlling this place.

398
00:21:24,130 --> 00:21:25,320
The enchanter must be nearby.

399
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:25,940
Search this place!

400
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:26,500
Yes, sir!

401
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:36,340
God is flying up to heaven!

402
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:38,850
God is flying up to heaven!

403
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:40,100
God is flying!

404
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:42,380
God is flying!

405
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:43,910
God is flying up to heaven!

406
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:07,650
Since you have ascended,

407
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:09,790
This form of you

408
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:11,940
and the name, Yin Shilang...

409
00:22:13,770 --> 00:22:15,240
Indeed, I have been using them for a long time.

410
00:22:15,850 --> 00:22:16,970
It's time to change them.

411
00:22:47,890 --> 00:22:49,050
Meet you with respect,

412
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:50,420
Immortal Venerable.

413
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:52,690
From tomorrow onwards,

414
00:22:53,010 --> 00:22:54,940
anyone who wants to buy Chang'an black tea

415
00:22:55,590 --> 00:22:56,850
will have to

416
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:59,010
curry favor with you.

417
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:10,970
Sheriff.

418
00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:13,440
The Dou family is here.

419
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:15,560
They are waiting for you in the county government.

420
00:23:15,890 --> 00:23:17,090
At such an ungodly hour? What happened?

421
00:23:17,330 --> 00:23:18,690
They tied Ling'er up,

422
00:23:18,910 --> 00:23:20,180
charging her of theft.

423
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:21,930
I didn't steal anything.

424
00:23:21,950 --> 00:23:23,870
Then where did you get this?

425
00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:26,300
That's the black tea left by Mr. Dou.

426
00:23:26,450 --> 00:23:28,040
Is it Chang'an black tea?

427
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:40,400
Dou Yulin drank that tea too?

428
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:41,350
No, he didn't.

429
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:42,840
He said he bought some authentic Chang'an black tea

430
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:44,060
from Yin Shilang

431
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:45,760
and planned to sell it at a high price in Luoyang.

432
00:23:46,050 --> 00:23:47,930
The money he earned would be left to Miss Dou.

433
00:23:49,910 --> 00:23:50,960
A-And me.

434
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:56,270
Su Qian.

435
00:23:57,810 --> 00:23:58,690
Untie her.

436
00:23:59,460 --> 00:23:59,940
Yes.

437
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:01,140
Sheriff Su,

438
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:03,540
I'll leave this thief at your disposal.

439
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:06,110
I want to take away Cong's body

440
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:08,660
so we can put her and her brother to rest.

441
00:24:09,050 --> 00:24:09,850
Sir,

442
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,590
we haven't found the murderer yet,

443
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:14,110
so I'm afraid you can't take her body away now.

444
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:15,370
As for Ling'er…

445
00:24:18,130 --> 00:24:19,000
Leave us alone.

446
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:19,820
Yes.

447
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:23,430
What did you say?

448
00:24:24,170 --> 00:24:26,530
My son Yulin really did that?

449
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:29,590
He was hoodwinked into doing that.

450
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:31,350
Last night, I found the drug

451
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:32,700
he used

452
00:24:32,810 --> 00:24:34,600
at Yin Shilang's place

453
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:36,630
in the Ghost Market.

454
00:24:38,250 --> 00:24:40,500
It's a herb found in Lingnan.

455
00:24:40,950 --> 00:24:41,590
If feed it to cows and horses,

456
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:42,790
in two hours,

457
00:24:42,930 --> 00:24:44,910
they will all run wildly

458
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:47,760
and sweat blood until they die.

459
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,010
Therefore, the drug is called Sweat Blood Powder.

460
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:53,200
When the carriage arrived at a certain place,

461
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:55,780
Dou Yulin pulled the horse to another direction

462
00:24:55,810 --> 00:24:57,490
and made the horse panic.

463
00:24:58,140 --> 00:24:58,500
Hurry.

464
00:24:58,600 --> 00:24:59,930
Dou Yulin planned on

465
00:24:59,970 --> 00:25:01,200
letting Yin Shilang

466
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:03,260
take Dou Cong

467
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:05,110
to live in Dongdu for a while.

468
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:07,730
She would come back when you were less angry.

469
00:25:08,470 --> 00:25:09,350
However,

470
00:25:09,730 --> 00:25:11,410
Yin Shilang is a scumbag.

471
00:25:12,250 --> 00:25:14,600
Your son basically helped the guy

472
00:25:16,330 --> 00:25:18,130
who meant no good for his sister.

473
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:20,010
If I had known better,

474
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:21,930
I wouldn't have insist

475
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:23,210
that marriage.

476
00:25:23,950 --> 00:25:24,800
I should've listened to Yulin

477
00:25:24,830 --> 00:25:26,410
and broken off Cong's engagement.

478
00:25:27,030 --> 00:25:28,400
My son and daughter died

479
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:30,460
because of me.

480
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:33,120
I'm sorry for your loss.

481
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:35,530
In Dou Yulin's plan,

482
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:37,770
Ling'er would go to Luoyang as well.

483
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:38,740
Ling'er?

484
00:25:39,370 --> 00:25:40,490
Why was that?

485
00:25:40,730 --> 00:25:43,150
Ling'er didn't steal anything.

486
00:25:43,170 --> 00:25:44,810
She just wanted to find

487
00:25:44,850 --> 00:25:46,570
the tea that Dou Yulin left for her.

488
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:48,700
She knew it was valuable.

489
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:50,260
She wanted to sell it

490
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:52,230
and use the money to raise the child.

491
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:53,450
Raise the child?

492
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:55,770
She's just a maid.

493
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:57,290
Ling'er.

494
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:59,520
Dou Yulin promised

495
00:25:59,550 --> 00:26:01,460
to take you to Luoyang.

496
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,440
Why?

497
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:10,370
How dare you.

498
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:11,190
Sheriff,

499
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:12,740
it's not my fault.

500
00:26:13,470 --> 00:26:14,670
When Mr. Dou learned

501
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:16,420
that his sister had to marry that gambler,

502
00:26:16,870 --> 00:26:17,870
he felt very depressed

503
00:26:18,050 --> 00:26:19,260
and drowned his sorrows every night.

504
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:20,820
Then...

505
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:26,390
I see.

506
00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:29,860
My son

507
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:32,290
indeed had feelings for that maid.

508
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:35,060
Sir.

509
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:37,350
Take Ling'er back

510
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:38,580
and treat her well.

511
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:40,080
After all,

512
00:26:40,430 --> 00:26:42,940
she's pregnant with your son's child.

513
00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:01,170
What kind of tea is this?

514
00:27:01,630 --> 00:27:03,430
The highly hyped

515
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:04,520
Chang'an black tea.

516
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:08,290
When I cleaned this house earlier,

517
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:10,850
I seemed to have seen this tea.

518
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:12,460
Really?

519
00:27:12,690 --> 00:27:13,770
Where is it?

520
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:22,330
Boil water.

521
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:39,900
My lord.

522
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:41,690
How is Xijun today?

523
00:27:42,430 --> 00:27:44,550
Not good. She tried to kill herself several times.

524
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:45,730
We made it to stop her

525
00:27:46,050 --> 00:27:48,740
but if we fail the next time...

526
00:27:49,890 --> 00:27:50,570
I understand.

527
00:28:17,790 --> 00:28:18,590
Father,

528
00:28:19,150 --> 00:28:20,370
please let me leave Chang'an

529
00:28:20,410 --> 00:28:21,600
and go search for Xiao.

530
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:25,300
Yes.

531
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:27,460
Xijun.

532
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:29,130
I know you love General Xiao

533
00:28:29,150 --> 00:28:30,150
to distraction.

534
00:28:30,330 --> 00:28:32,320
But he died on the battlefield long ago.

535
00:28:32,690 --> 00:28:33,970
He can't come back to life.

536
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:35,510
Are you going

537
00:28:35,670 --> 00:28:37,270
to search for his ghost?

538
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:39,060
No.

539
00:28:40,570 --> 00:28:42,150
I saw him last night.

540
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:44,780
He didn't die.

541
00:28:45,850 --> 00:28:47,870
You saw him in your dream.

542
00:28:48,650 --> 00:28:50,740
How could the imperial dispatch be wrong?

543
00:29:02,550 --> 00:29:03,620
Xiao.

544
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:08,290
Xiao.

545
00:29:11,130 --> 00:29:12,080
All right, Xijun.

546
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:14,700
I brought you

547
00:29:14,730 --> 00:29:15,850
a pot of tea.

548
00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:26,230
This is top-notch tea.

549
00:29:26,790 --> 00:29:27,590
Drink it.

550
00:29:28,090 --> 00:29:29,840
It can relieve your pain.

551
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:36,550
Don't be so willful!

552
00:29:36,890 --> 00:29:38,110
This is Chang'an black tea.

553
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:39,640
Even Her Highness is drinking it.

554
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:42,300
What a waste.

555
00:29:42,810 --> 00:29:44,760
I just want to marry Xiao.

556
00:29:45,890 --> 00:29:47,280
Please grant my wish, father.

557
00:29:58,440 --> 00:29:59,800
I'm Su Wuming, the sheriff of Chang'an.

558
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:01,230
It's such an honor to meet you, Assistant Minister Pei.

559
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:07,580
Good to see you, Sheriff Su.

560
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:09,020
Have a seat.

561
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:10,470
Thank you.

562
00:30:14,390 --> 00:30:15,380
What brought you here?

563
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:18,980
You don't look well, sir.

564
00:30:19,610 --> 00:30:21,220
Did you sleep badly last night?

565
00:30:24,450 --> 00:30:27,010
I'm in my fifties now.

566
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:29,740
My only child is my daughter.

567
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:32,550
Xijun is my everything.

568
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:34,860
She's gone mad recently

569
00:30:35,050 --> 00:30:35,670
and insists on marrying

570
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:37,530
General Xiao, who's a dead man.

571
00:30:38,070 --> 00:30:39,470
I'm the Assistant Minister of the Ministry of Personnel Administration.

572
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:40,580
Does she expect me

573
00:30:41,060 --> 00:30:42,950
to agree to her marrying a dead man?

574
00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:45,460
Last night,

575
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:47,240
I drank a whole pot of

576
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:48,310
Chang'an black tea,

577
00:30:49,130 --> 00:30:50,300
but I still couldn't have a nice sleep.

578
00:30:50,950 --> 00:30:53,010
I mean no offense,

579
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:54,710
but please don't drink

580
00:30:54,740 --> 00:30:56,020
that tea again.

581
00:30:58,120 --> 00:30:59,310
Chang'an black tea

582
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:00,900
is the best tea among all teas.

583
00:31:01,190 --> 00:31:02,950
Even Her Highness is drinking it.

584
00:31:03,450 --> 00:31:05,040
Why can't I drink it?

585
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:06,220
I suspect

586
00:31:06,870 --> 00:31:09,350
that tea contains prohibited ingredient.

587
00:31:09,530 --> 00:31:11,170
Please think twice

588
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:13,220
before you drink it again.

589
00:31:17,650 --> 00:31:18,570
I recall something interesting.

590
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:20,680
After you got drunk that day,

591
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:23,410
you mistook the first-class black tea as blood

592
00:31:23,770 --> 00:31:24,920
and fainted.

593
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:26,360
Don't spread

594
00:31:26,390 --> 00:31:27,920
ungrounded rumors

595
00:31:28,170 --> 00:31:29,660
just because you don't like the tea yourself.

596
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:31,760
Have you ever experienced hallucinations

597
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:33,300
after drinking that tea?

598
00:31:36,490 --> 00:31:38,030
You don't have to answer.

599
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,400
I came here today

600
00:31:43,470 --> 00:31:45,230
to warn you about that.

601
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:47,150
I'm not doing this

602
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:48,630
because you helped me get promotion.

603
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:49,500
It's just that

604
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:51,700
my teacher, Detective Di, once told me

605
00:31:51,890 --> 00:31:54,210
that you're a virtuous and knowledgeable man,

606
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:56,670
and that you're the pillar of the country.

607
00:32:07,490 --> 00:32:08,800
Take care.

608
00:32:12,590 --> 00:32:13,070
By the way,

609
00:32:13,750 --> 00:32:15,410
I saw the portrait of General Xiao

610
00:32:15,430 --> 00:32:16,870
drawn by Miss Xijun the other day.

611
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:18,310
It's so vivid.

612
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:19,440
I suppose

613
00:32:19,470 --> 00:32:20,740
you know this General Xiao

614
00:32:20,770 --> 00:32:22,070
very well, right?

615
00:32:22,370 --> 00:32:24,090
We met a few times when he was a boy.

616
00:32:24,390 --> 00:32:26,270
After his father, Minister Xiao, retired and returned to his hometown,

617
00:32:26,630 --> 00:32:27,660
I never saw him again.

618
00:32:27,950 --> 00:32:28,890
So Miss Xijun drew his potrait

619
00:32:28,910 --> 00:32:30,560
by imagination?

620
00:32:32,380 --> 00:32:33,290
No.

621
00:32:33,530 --> 00:32:35,140
When General Xiao came to the capital to meet His Majesty,

622
00:32:35,210 --> 00:32:36,380
he stayed in Chang'an for several days,

623
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:38,150
but he didn't pay me a visit.

624
00:32:38,570 --> 00:32:40,420
Maybe he was too busy with military affairs.

625
00:32:41,530 --> 00:32:42,640
Without me knowing,

626
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:43,980
Xijun held a farewell banquet for him

627
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:45,380
before he left.

628
00:32:46,290 --> 00:32:48,440
This is an vibrant era

629
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:49,810
and there are boisterous parties every day.

630
00:32:50,310 --> 00:32:52,670
Besides, she's a young girl

631
00:32:52,730 --> 00:32:54,390
engaged to General Xiao

632
00:32:54,950 --> 00:32:55,910
who had feelings for her too,

633
00:32:56,380 --> 00:32:58,420
so I just let her.

634
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:02,690
I see.

635
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:07,440
Wine!

636
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:09,650
Wine.

637
00:33:11,780 --> 00:33:13,060
Give me wine.

638
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:25,940
It's you.

639
00:33:26,630 --> 00:33:27,430
Drink with me.

640
00:33:29,770 --> 00:33:31,600
Enough, General.

641
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,910
I was fooled by the enchanter.

642
00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:35,940
Wu died because of me.

643
00:33:36,460 --> 00:33:37,180
Su Wuming.

644
00:33:38,130 --> 00:33:39,340
Are you here to laugh at me?

645
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:42,760
I was fooled,

646
00:33:43,910 --> 00:33:45,400
but you saw through the trick.

647
00:33:46,510 --> 00:33:48,750
It turns out that Detective Di was right

648
00:33:49,850 --> 00:33:51,590
in taking you as his disciple

649
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:53,390
instead of me.

650
00:33:54,250 --> 00:33:55,250
I'm a loser.

651
00:33:56,220 --> 00:33:57,350
I am a loser.

652
00:33:57,370 --> 00:33:59,740
I'm a downright loser!

653
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:01,200
General,

654
00:34:01,420 --> 00:34:03,180
don't give up on yourself.

655
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:05,590
We're humans and humans make mistakes.

656
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:06,880
It doesn't matter

657
00:34:07,070 --> 00:34:08,429
as long as you can correct your mistake.

658
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:09,610
Bullshit!

659
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:11,949
General!

660
00:34:12,219 --> 00:34:12,739
Calm down.

661
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:14,920
Calm down.

662
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:23,139
Let me tell you something interesting.

663
00:34:24,090 --> 00:34:27,120
It didn't take me much effort

664
00:34:27,230 --> 00:34:29,320
to find out that General Xiao Bozhao

665
00:34:29,350 --> 00:34:30,770
is your cousin.

666
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:34,580
What does that have to do with you?

667
00:34:37,290 --> 00:34:38,330
I'm just curious.

668
00:34:39,230 --> 00:34:41,969
I heard that General Xiao was over six feet tall

669
00:34:42,420 --> 00:34:44,659
and used a silver spear.

670
00:34:44,889 --> 00:34:46,570
On the battlefield,

671
00:34:46,679 --> 00:34:50,159
he could take off the enemy leader's head without effort.

672
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:51,739
Nonsense.

673
00:34:52,889 --> 00:34:54,530
If he were truly that able,

674
00:34:55,239 --> 00:34:56,760
he wouldn't have died in the Western Region.

675
00:34:58,310 --> 00:34:59,710
He used two maces

676
00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:02,100
and was about five feet five.

677
00:35:05,250 --> 00:35:07,300
So I guess it right.

678
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:09,760
The man Pei Xijun

679
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:11,360
drew in the portrait

680
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:13,230
was not General Xiao,

681
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:16,540
but you.

682
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:20,510
Su Wuming.

683
00:35:21,250 --> 00:35:22,610
As the sheriff of Chang'an,

684
00:35:22,990 --> 00:35:24,300
you should be busy looking into the murder cases

685
00:35:24,810 --> 00:35:26,500
instead of making fun of me here.

686
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:28,590
Your head

687
00:35:28,890 --> 00:35:29,970
should be on the ground already.

688
00:35:30,580 --> 00:35:31,300
Look at you.

689
00:35:32,290 --> 00:35:33,920
So that's true.

690
00:35:35,140 --> 00:35:35,820
General!

691
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:39,730
What is it?

692
00:35:41,770 --> 00:35:42,460
The Crown Prince

693
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:43,700
wants you to be presented at court, General.

694
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:00,520
Six months ago,

695
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:02,400
Helan Mieming, the Master of the Horse, died.

696
00:36:02,850 --> 00:36:03,730
Three months ago,

697
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:05,600
Lieutenant Li Buqi died.

698
00:36:05,860 --> 00:36:06,660
One month ago,

699
00:36:07,410 --> 00:36:09,020
Sun Xiu, the Military Commander of Yongzhou died too.

700
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:10,810
They all committed suicide for no reason.

701
00:36:12,410 --> 00:36:13,050
Lu Lingfeng,

702
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:15,080
have you found anything?

703
00:36:15,790 --> 00:36:16,670
The three of them

704
00:36:16,810 --> 00:36:18,520
had been secretly drinking a kind of tea.

705
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:21,550
Chang'an black tea?

706
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:22,460
Yes.

707
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:28,060
Last night,

708
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:30,150
Professor Cui Dongwang,

709
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:33,150
the man with acclaimed excellence

710
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:34,990
in poetry and calligraphy,

711
00:36:35,590 --> 00:36:36,830
a standard-rank-five official,

712
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:40,000
[The Crown Prince of Tang]

713
00:36:37,850 --> 00:36:39,380
spent the last penny he had

714
00:36:39,570 --> 00:36:40,730
on Chang'an black tea.

715
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:41,670
He was up to his eyeballs in debt then.

716
00:36:42,390 --> 00:36:43,520
He wasn't repentant at all,

717
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:44,890
claiming to hear gods summoning him

718
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:46,410
after drinking that tea.

719
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:49,740
He then jumped into Qu River and died.

720
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:53,830
Chang'an black tea

721
00:36:54,340 --> 00:36:55,450
is diabolically poisonous.

722
00:36:57,660 --> 00:36:58,670
How can you be so sure?

723
00:36:58,810 --> 00:37:00,080
I sneaked into the Ghost Market

724
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:01,920
and found Yin Shilang,

725
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:02,820
the man who sold Chang'an black tea.

726
00:37:03,140 --> 00:37:04,640
But I was set up

727
00:37:04,660 --> 00:37:05,340
by that enchanter.

728
00:37:05,490 --> 00:37:06,470
He made me see illusions

729
00:37:06,980 --> 00:37:08,040
and almost killed me.

730
00:37:11,620 --> 00:37:12,580
Tea

731
00:37:13,740 --> 00:37:14,920
is not harmful.

732
00:37:16,430 --> 00:37:18,070
Although it's relatively new in the country,

733
00:37:18,580 --> 00:37:19,550
as far as I know,

734
00:37:20,050 --> 00:37:21,610
many people are drinking it in Chang'an.

735
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:23,380
But now,

736
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:25,110
someone is using tea to fool our people

737
00:37:25,210 --> 00:37:26,570
and weaken the spirit of the country.

738
00:37:27,340 --> 00:37:27,940
Lu Lingfeng,

739
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:29,700
you'll assist the Capital Tea Alliance

740
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:31,040
to investigate the case.

741
00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:33,770
Yes, Your Highness.

742
00:37:36,990 --> 00:37:37,770
You'd better

743
00:37:38,250 --> 00:37:39,640
quit drinking.

744
00:37:42,010 --> 00:37:43,030
Thank you for your concern, Your Highness.

745
00:37:43,730 --> 00:37:44,510
I'll keep that in mind.

746
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:46,110
Go.

747
00:37:46,770 --> 00:37:47,630
Be careful.

748
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:19,020
Why are you still here?

749
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:23,110
Welcome back.

750
00:38:29,060 --> 00:38:30,700
How can I leave

751
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:32,330
without biding you farewell?

752
00:38:32,370 --> 00:38:33,420
What were you doing here?

753
00:38:33,830 --> 00:38:35,360
I couldn't find the records of many old cases

754
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:36,410
in the county government,

755
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:38,000
but I found them here at your place.

756
00:38:38,290 --> 00:38:40,170
They may not be comprehensive and evidence-based,

757
00:38:40,190 --> 00:38:40,590
but

758
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:42,340
they're helpful for the investigation.

759
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:44,260
These are not official documents.

760
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:46,780
I recorded those cases myself.

761
00:38:47,620 --> 00:38:48,450
I've seen that.

762
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:49,980
I read

763
00:38:50,010 --> 00:38:52,160
your speculations and analysis of the cases.

764
00:38:52,460 --> 00:38:54,280
Some of them are brilliant,

765
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:56,090
but the others…

766
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:58,120
Are total nonsense.

767
00:38:58,340 --> 00:38:58,940
Su Wuming.

768
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:00,350
You're in my house,

769
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:01,140
not your office.

770
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:02,680
You can leave now.

771
00:39:05,590 --> 00:39:06,150
General.

772
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:10,340
I can't leave.

773
00:39:12,670 --> 00:39:14,790
I remember that when I first came to Chang'an,

774
00:39:14,810 --> 00:39:15,730
you told me

775
00:39:15,770 --> 00:39:17,450
the sheriff before me, Mr. Wu,

776
00:39:17,820 --> 00:39:18,760
died a strange death.

777
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:21,250
Recently, I found out

778
00:39:21,610 --> 00:39:23,040
that Sheriff Wu had also been drinking Chang'an black tea

779
00:39:23,230 --> 00:39:24,990
until his death.

780
00:39:27,220 --> 00:39:27,620
Enough.

781
00:39:28,540 --> 00:39:29,290
You're just a sheriff.

782
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:31,450
Leave the tea case to me.

783
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:32,390
Go focus on

784
00:39:32,420 --> 00:39:33,500
those murdered brides.

785
00:39:33,770 --> 00:39:35,210
One bride disappeared every month.

786
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:36,440
If this continued,

787
00:39:36,810 --> 00:39:37,640
no families in Chang'an

788
00:39:37,910 --> 00:39:38,810
would dare to marry their girls.

789
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:40,950
You're so very right,

790
00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:42,930
but my instincts tell me

791
00:39:42,970 --> 00:39:45,160
that Chang'an black tea is a very important clue.

792
00:39:47,090 --> 00:39:48,370
Why don't we work together?

793
00:39:50,210 --> 00:39:51,130
Su Wuming,

794
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:52,800
who do you think you are?

795
00:39:53,260 --> 00:39:54,530
His Highness ordered me

796
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:55,930
to thoroughly investigate the tea case.

797
00:39:57,090 --> 00:39:58,150
Who are you to meddle in?

798
00:39:58,900 --> 00:39:59,380
Get out,

799
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:01,180
or I'll kick you out.

800
00:40:02,220 --> 00:40:04,630
It's recorded clearly in those files

801
00:40:05,340 --> 00:40:07,820
that the brides started disappearing a year ago.

802
00:40:08,260 --> 00:40:10,160
Chang'an black tea

803
00:40:10,460 --> 00:40:11,700
appeared in the market a year ago too.

804
00:40:12,290 --> 00:40:13,420
One bride went missing

805
00:40:13,510 --> 00:40:14,860
every month.

806
00:40:14,890 --> 00:40:16,320
The price of Chang'an black tea

807
00:40:16,340 --> 00:40:17,970
changed every month too.

808
00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:18,860
Perhaps

809
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:21,840
the two cases are related.

810
00:40:22,590 --> 00:40:23,290
Leave!

811
00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:24,420
Or it'll end badly for you.

812
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:25,560
Fine.

813
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:26,620
I'm leaving.

814
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:28,230
I'm leaving.

815
00:40:30,670 --> 00:40:31,750
General.

816
00:40:39,530 --> 00:40:40,220
Sheriff,

817
00:40:41,850 --> 00:40:43,080
what are you doing?

818
00:40:47,030 --> 00:40:49,350
What a thoughtful man.

819
00:40:50,130 --> 00:40:51,460
Who are you talking about?

820
00:40:55,410 --> 00:40:56,550
Lu Lingfeng.

821
00:40:57,210 --> 00:40:58,660
That general?

822
00:40:59,010 --> 00:41:00,340
He's so arrogant

823
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:03,570
and intimidating.

824
00:41:05,710 --> 00:41:07,720
Don't judge a book by its cover.

825
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:09,860
There are no official records

826
00:41:10,210 --> 00:41:12,340
of the missing brides.

827
00:41:13,330 --> 00:41:14,790
But I found records of each disappearing

828
00:41:15,410 --> 00:41:17,370
in Lu Lingfeng's house.

829
00:41:18,470 --> 00:41:19,470
Up to now,

830
00:41:20,180 --> 00:41:22,120
four bodies have been found

831
00:41:22,650 --> 00:41:25,040
in the south, north, east, and west

832
00:41:25,130 --> 00:41:27,520
of Chang'an.

833
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:32,110
I suspect the murderer deliberately dumped the bodies

834
00:41:32,140 --> 00:41:34,130
for people to discover them.

835
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:36,870
Those brides were killed as a part of

836
00:41:37,060 --> 00:41:38,200
a ritual.

837
00:41:39,050 --> 00:41:40,930
If I'm right,

838
00:41:41,310 --> 00:41:43,150
more bodies can be found

839
00:41:43,330 --> 00:41:44,850
at the places I marked.

840
00:41:45,230 --> 00:41:47,110
It won't be an easy task.

841
00:41:47,270 --> 00:41:48,980
We need to search carefully

842
00:41:49,270 --> 00:41:52,390
and even dig under the ground.

843
00:42:08,180 --> 00:42:12,280
♫The storm rises with no reason♫

844
00:42:12,930 --> 00:42:15,300

♫To be consoled by the truth, even with thorns on my back♫

866
00:43:57,540 --> 00:44:01,940
♫Only for justice♫

867
00:44:03,910 --> 00:44:10,190
♫That I seek a truth for this long, lonely night♫

868
00:44:10,460 --> 00:44:16,360
♫The heaven and the earth are held together by a strong will♫

869
00:44:17,390 --> 00:44:19,450
♫The world is at ease♫

870
00:44:19,470 --> 00:44:23,900
♫Carving right and wrong into a clear heart♫

871
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:26,020
♫The truth♫

872
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:29,770
♫Will reinterpret this justice♫

873
00:44:30,010 --> 00:44:36,110
♫Even if there are a thousand sails, it's not a waste of time♫

874
00:44:36,540 --> 00:44:42,720
♫What I am afraid of is the unrighted wrong♫

875
00:44:43,290 --> 00:44:45,200
♫What does life and death mean?♫

876
00:44:45,420 --> 00:44:49,560
♫I'll paint the sunshine into the landscape♫

877
00:44:49,870 --> 00:44:51,590
♫The spirit of righteousness♫

878
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:55,250
♫Will last forever in my heart♫
