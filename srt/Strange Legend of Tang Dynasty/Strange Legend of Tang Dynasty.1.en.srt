but turning over the body at will

134

that the murderer behind these homicide cases

151

Later in the legend, he evolved into

00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:40,060
According to the Tang Dynasty's rules,

177
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:42,180
the person who can use Fang Xiang

178
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:43,380
must be above the fourth-rank official.

179

Ordinary people can't use it without permission.

Write it dwon.

181

The mask is deep in the victim's skin.

and has become one with her face.

183
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:01,450
The murderer's method of killing

184
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:05,660
is bizarre and terrifying.

185
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:06,930
Wu.

186
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:09,080
Tomorrow morning, you go and find out

who lost the bride.

188
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:14,230
If I remember correctly,

189
00:13:14,810 --> 00:13:16,180
the first time this happened

190
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:19,590
should be in early July last year.

191
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:21,250
Which is, one year ago.

192
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:23,100
Yes.

193
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:32,640
General.

194

Do you want to be the president of the Supreme Court?

195

No.

196

You don't want?

197
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:40,050
Then why are your eyes shining

198
00:13:40,090 --> 00:13:41,170
when you hear about

199
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:43,340
a homicide case?

200
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:44,820
Nonsense.

201
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:47,180
You brat.

202
00:13:47,210 --> 00:13:48,290
Do you want to be beaten?

203
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:49,020
General, calm down.

204
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:50,760
I will shut my mouth up.

No, no.

212

You are the Assistant Minister of the Ministry of Personnel,

213
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:06,300
but you invite

214
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,860
a newly arrived sheriff to dinner.

215
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:10,140
I really dare not drink this wine.

218
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:14,330
Why do you say so?

219
00:14:14,930 --> 00:14:17,290
In the early spring, the princess traveled to Wugong County,

220
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:18,740
[Wen Chao, Minister of the Household]

221
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,660
and lost a container for incense at the courier station.

222
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:20,850
Do you remember?

223
00:14:21,170 --> 00:14:21,690
Yes.

224
00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:23,950
I caught the thief

225
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:24,910
at that night.

226
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:27,130
So,

227
00:14:29,190 --> 00:14:29,890
now you understand.

228
00:14:31,850 --> 00:14:32,900
So Sheriff Su

229
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:34,800
was recommended by the princess.

invited you.

233

I am honored to be here.

234

Alright. Enough.

You still say you're not crazy?

General Xiao has died on the battlefield.

Dead?

249
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:12,730
Then I will marry it.

Please grant me.

I feel ill at ease because of my daughter.

271

If I don't drink a little,

275
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:00,340
Exactly.

276
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:03,260
I hear that the tea is very expensive.

277
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,210
Copper coins

278
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:05,990
can never but it.

279
00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:07,300
Three ingots of silver

280
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:09,740
can only buy one liang of tea.

281
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:12,280
Sometimes you have to use gold.

282
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:14,079
I bought it

283
00:17:14,099 --> 00:17:15,420
with my own savings.

284
00:17:15,930 --> 00:17:16,660
Today,

285
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,349
I mainly want to treat Sheriff Su.

-That's right. -Right.

Go.

290
00:17:29,570 --> 00:17:30,060
General.

291
00:17:30,610 --> 00:17:31,370
We found the owner.

292
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:36,260
Is it yours?

293
00:17:36,970 --> 00:17:37,410
Yes.

294
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:39,340
Thank you, General.

295
00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:43,200
Only copper coins are circulated in the Tang's market.

Most officials

297
00:17:45,870 --> 00:17:47,160
don't have a golden cake like yours.

298
00:17:47,670 --> 00:17:48,990
Think about when you showed your riches

299
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:50,100
and when you were targeted by a thief.

300
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:51,440
You should learn from it.

301
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:52,280
That must be

302
00:17:52,490 --> 00:17:54,630
when I bought Chang'an black tea in the East Market.

303
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:56,290
Chang'an black tea?

304
00:17:57,140 --> 00:17:57,830
Did you buy it?

305
00:17:58,540 --> 00:17:59,300
No.

306
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:01,420
I didn't expect the immortal tea

307
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:02,940
was so hard to buy in Chang'an.

308
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:03,700
How dare you!

309
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:06,460
Who said this was immortal tea?

310
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:08,520
I've heard it

311
00:18:08,890 --> 00:18:09,810
when I was in Luoyang.

312
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:11,980
Chang'an black tea is popular in the capital.

313
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:14,060
The high officials and nobles rush to buy it.

314
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:16,530
The saints and the princess are enjoying them.

315
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:17,380
That's why I...

316
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:18,230
Nonsense!

317
00:18:36,010 --> 00:18:36,820
The tea's raw material

318
00:18:37,090 --> 00:18:38,210
is rare,

319
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:39,580
and the method to make it is unique.

320
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:42,460
The elderly will feel refreshed

321
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:44,070
and their physique will stretch after drinking it.

322
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:45,850
After young people drink it,

323
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:47,420
their yangqi will overflow

324
00:18:47,610 --> 00:18:49,360
and they will have infinite energy.

325
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:51,590
It is said that if someone drinks it often,

326
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:53,350
he can even reach the fairyland

327
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:55,340
and dance with the deity.

328
00:18:55,650 --> 00:18:56,780
I hear about it too.

329
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:58,210
I didn't expect

330
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,760
I was so lucky to drink it tonight.

331
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:06,360
Come on.

332
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:08,880

333
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:10,060

336
00:19:24,670 --> 00:19:26,710
Such a quiet courtyard.

Where is this place?

and once made military contributions in the border.

345

He drowned here

00:19:47,290 --> 00:19:48,430
is ominous.

350
00:19:49,570 --> 00:19:51,370
Those who are afraid of ominous things

351
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:54,310
are trapped in the fog.

352
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:55,870
Once the truth is revealed,

353
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:57,420
they'll be surprised

354
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:58,460
that the truth

355
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:02,160
is so close to us.

356
00:20:07,010 --> 00:20:07,820
Sheriff Su.

357
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:11,850
Magistrate Yuan.

358
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:13,560
Why are you here?

359
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:14,860
I'm worried about you.

360
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:15,760
Yesterday,

361
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:17,420
you scared me.

362
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:19,820
When I saw the color of the tea,

363
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:21,110
my head

364
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:22,780
became a real mess.

365
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:24,020
To be honest,

366
00:20:24,230 --> 00:20:26,280
I faint at the sight of blood since childhood.

367
00:20:27,130 --> 00:20:28,330
Faint at the sight of blood?

368
00:20:30,770 --> 00:20:32,620
You are the disciple of Detective Di.

369
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:33,740
I heard that...

370
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:37,210
Rumours may not be true,

371
00:20:37,230 --> 00:20:40,110
but me fainting at the sight of blood is absolutely true.

372
00:20:40,310 --> 00:20:42,560
Sorry for that, magistrate.

373
00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:43,780
In that case,

374
00:20:44,130 --> 00:20:45,290
you can still solve mysterious cases

375
00:20:45,330 --> 00:20:47,230
in Wugong County.

376
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,840
You are really a genius.

377
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:51,210
I'm just lucky.

378
00:20:52,410 --> 00:20:52,930
By the way,

379
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:55,330
General Lu from the Imperial Guards said

380
00:20:55,350 --> 00:20:57,470
that there were many cases of missing brides  in the capital

381
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:58,740
last year.

382
00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:00,860
I want to see the old case files.

383
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:05,650
Don't mention it.

384
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:08,200
The former magistrate Wu Daqi

385
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:09,140
died accidentally.

386
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:10,850
Yongzhou Government,

387
00:21:11,110 --> 00:21:12,030
the Supreme Court,

388
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:12,980
and the Imperial Guards

389
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:14,260
sent people in turn.

390
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:15,410
His residence

391
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:16,980
and his office

392
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:19,460
were searched everywhere.

393
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:22,510
All the files were confiscated,

394
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:25,500
and no one has returned them so far.

395
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:32,310
I see.

396
00:21:40,810 --> 00:21:41,450
General.

397
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,050
I saw you last night.

398
00:21:45,090 --> 00:21:45,570
Where?

399
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:47,340
On a painting.

400
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:50,620
Do you know

401
00:21:50,650 --> 00:21:52,380
Miss Xijun, daughter of Assistant Minister Pei of Ministry of Personnel?

402
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:54,250
No.

403
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:56,590
General.

404
00:21:56,910 --> 00:21:58,870
You're hiding it on purpose.

405
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:01,400
Don't you have anything to do?

406
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:02,970
Have you found out the truth

407
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:04,260
about the female corpse last night?

408
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:07,010
I'm investigating.

409
00:22:07,410 --> 00:22:09,480
The bride went missing on the day she got married.

410
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:11,020
Then she was murdered and dumped.

411
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:12,310
Similar cases

412
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:13,920
happened on occasion in a year.

413
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:15,600
As the sheirff of Chang'an,

414
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:16,860
you don't investigate the case,

415
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:18,300
instead, you cling to powerful people

416
00:22:18,810 --> 00:22:19,980
and look at the paintings!

417
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:22,820
You are nervous,

418
00:22:23,650 --> 00:22:25,340
which means you must know

419
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:26,200
Miss Xijun.

420
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:27,660
Tell me. Tell me.

421
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:29,230
What's going on between you and Miss Xijun?

422
00:22:29,690 --> 00:22:30,180
Boring.

423
00:22:31,970 --> 00:22:33,210
Detective Di has an impressive reputation.

424
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:36,250
Why did he accept a disciple like you?

425
00:22:40,330 --> 00:22:41,440
The bride's surname is Dou.

426
00:22:41,810 --> 00:22:43,260
The Imperial Guards have ordered his family

427
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,040
to identify the body.

428
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:48,020
Thank you, General.

429
00:22:48,430 --> 00:22:49,700
My daughter.

430
00:22:49,890 --> 00:22:51,220
My daughter!

431
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:52,840
My daughter.

432
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:54,080
My condolences.

433
00:22:54,430 --> 00:22:57,340
[Mortuary, Chang'an County]

434
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:55,550
Madam.

435
00:22:55,870 --> 00:22:56,990
My daughter.

436
00:22:57,810 --> 00:22:58,840
My daughter.

437
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:01,030
What happened to you?

438
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:04,170
Sheriff.

439
00:23:05,330 --> 00:23:06,450
The deceased is Dou Cong.

440
00:23:06,690 --> 00:23:07,570
She got married yesterday.

441
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:09,910
The groom lived in a town

442
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:11,420
5km away from the Mingde Gate.

443
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:13,150
The carriage went on as normal,

444
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:14,100
but halfway,

445
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:14,960
the horse got a fright

446
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:15,900
and then disappeared.

447
00:23:17,310 --> 00:23:18,390
Have you identified the body?

448
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,900
We can't identify her face,

449
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:22,620
but the red mole behind the ears

450
00:23:22,790 --> 00:23:23,930
and the birthmark on the waist

451
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:25,340
showed that it was her.

452
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:27,110
You...

453
00:23:28,010 --> 00:23:30,530
Are you the new sheriff?

454
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:31,090
Yes.

455
00:23:31,570 --> 00:23:33,480
Please find out who killed

456
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:35,350
my daughter.

457
00:23:35,450 --> 00:23:36,600
Sir, please get up.

458
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:37,460
Please rise.

459
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:38,940
The murderer is Song Chai.

460
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:42,400
This is...

461
00:23:42,570 --> 00:23:44,600
My son, Dou Yulin.

462
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:47,540
I've been waiting for the bride at home.

463
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:48,980
How did I become the murderer?

464
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:50,980
If you didn't leave my sister behind,

465
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:52,160
she wouldn't have died tragically.

466
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:53,540
This is the custom of Tang.

467
00:23:53,570 --> 00:23:54,280
What custom?

468
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:55,930
-It must be your trick. -You...

469
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:02,580
Dou Yulin.

470
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:04,300
I heard from your servant

471
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:06,060
that the bride's horse was frightened.

472
00:24:06,290 --> 00:24:07,580
But you didn't go after it.

473
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:09,580
Where did you go?

474
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:14,100
It has nothing to do with my sister's death.

475
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:15,580
Answer me.

476
00:24:17,230 --> 00:24:18,060
I went to drink.

477
00:24:20,030 --> 00:24:21,990
Your sister married Song Chai.

478
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:23,110
Are you unhappy with that?

479
00:24:23,210 --> 00:24:23,610
Of course.

480
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:24,600
It's all my father's fault.

481
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:25,630
My sister shouldn't

482
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:26,580
marry this scumbag.

483
00:24:26,810 --> 00:24:27,170
You...

484
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:29,890
Sheriff Su,

485
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:31,470
even if Song Chai is not the murderer,

486
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:33,180
he must have something to do

487
00:24:33,370 --> 00:24:34,220
with my sister's death.

488
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:35,570
Please investigate it.

489
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:38,060
Leave here now.

490
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:42,860
You...

491
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:46,300
Sheriff Su.

492
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:47,120
Cong.

493
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:49,750
Cong is really dead?

494
00:24:52,130 --> 00:24:53,100
Cong didn't come.

495
00:24:54,550 --> 00:24:55,530
I thought it was Dou Yulin

496
00:24:55,550 --> 00:24:56,310
who had something to do with it.

497
00:24:56,380 --> 00:24:57,820
He took his sister back.

498
00:24:58,290 --> 00:24:59,760
Why do you think so?

499
00:25:00,410 --> 00:25:01,420
My parents died.

500
00:25:02,010 --> 00:25:02,890
My family fell apart.

501
00:25:03,070 --> 00:25:04,680
The Dou family wanted to break off the engagement,

502
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:06,110
especially Dou Yulin.

503
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:07,580
He spoke rudely for several times.

504
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:09,930
If it weren't for my father-in-law's decision,

505
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:12,260
and for Cong's love to me,

506
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:14,250
there would be no such thing as yesterday's marriage.

507
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:15,370
Sheriff Su,

508
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:17,740
please catch the murderer

509
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:19,860
to soothe the death of my wife.

510
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:23,820
I see.

511
00:25:27,170 --> 00:25:27,900
Sheriff Su, please.

512
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:34,650
Sheriff.

513
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:36,440
Ask Song Chai

514
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:37,730
to come to the county government

515
00:25:37,930 --> 00:25:39,300
and report his whereabouts every morning.

516
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:40,510
What's your purpose?

517
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:42,620
I'm afraid he'll escape punishment.

518
00:25:42,710 --> 00:25:43,590
That's impossible.

519
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:45,100
He's the groom.

520
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:47,230
And also a gambler.

521
00:25:47,670 --> 00:25:48,670
We can't trust him.

522
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:53,500
Song Chai wasn't captured.

523
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:55,420
It seems that Su Wuming

524
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:56,460
doesn't suspect Song Chai.

525
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,130
That fool.

526
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:00,340
Song Chai is a gambler.

527
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:01,490
We can't trust him.

528
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:03,430
How do you know he is a gambler?

529
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:05,940
I came here this morning.

530
00:26:06,090 --> 00:26:06,880
He hasn't gone home yet.

531
00:26:07,650 --> 00:26:08,460
It's curfew in Chang'an.

532
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:09,900
Those who don't go back home at night are

533
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:11,500
the drunkard and gambler.

534
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:13,500
But he didn't drink.

535
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:14,900
He probably went to gamble.

536
00:26:15,670 --> 00:26:16,730
His poor family

537
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:18,330
also proves that.

538
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:23,140
Big. Big.

539
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:23,850
Small. Small.

540
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:24,570
Small.

541
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:25,260
Small.

542
00:26:25,290 --> 00:26:25,700
Small.

543
00:26:25,730 --> 00:26:26,200
All in.

544
00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:26,580
Small.

545
00:26:29,970 --> 00:26:30,610
All in.

546
00:26:32,170 --> 00:26:32,730
Small.

547
00:26:33,290 --> 00:26:34,170
Big. Big.

548
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:34,860
Small. Small.

549
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:35,900
Big. Small.

550
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:37,300
Big! Big! Big!

551
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:38,860
Big! Big!

552
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:43,300
Big. Big. Big.

553
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:44,000
It must be big.

554
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:44,500
Big! Big!

555
00:26:44,530 --> 00:26:45,000
I win!

556
00:26:45,150 --> 00:26:45,990
I win!

557
00:26:53,750 --> 00:26:54,190
Who's that?

558
00:26:56,820 --> 00:26:57,660
It's you.

559
00:26:58,780 --> 00:26:59,880
I saw you at the gambling house

560
00:27:00,090 --> 00:27:02,440
winning quite a lot.

561
00:27:03,570 --> 00:27:04,690
Can you give me some instructions?

562
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:06,000
Instructions?

563
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:10,650
I have been unlucky for three years,

564
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:12,290
before I turn over now.

565
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:14,150
Brother,

566
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:16,550
I want to have a fortune like you,

567
00:27:16,630 --> 00:27:18,150
but I have no seed money.

568
00:27:18,330 --> 00:27:19,480
So I want to ask you

569
00:27:19,710 --> 00:27:21,080
how to get the seed money.

570
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:28,060
Stand straight.

571
00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:30,780
Judging from your appearance,

572
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:32,960
your family should be relatively rich.

573
00:27:36,650 --> 00:27:37,600
My family declined.

574
00:27:37,650 --> 00:27:38,380
Don't worry.

575
00:27:38,850 --> 00:27:40,210
As long as you are from a well-respected family,

576
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:42,100
you can have a good wife.

577
00:27:43,070 --> 00:27:44,950
That's where the seed money comes from.

578
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:46,340
What do you mean?

579
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:47,530
I don't understand.

580
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:48,540
Please tell me more.

581
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:49,800
-You are such a... -Song Chai.

582
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:52,220
I've been looking for you everywhere.

583
00:27:53,150 --> 00:27:53,700
Brother,

584
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:54,670
Help me.

585
00:27:54,950 --> 00:27:56,080
I'll lend you some money.

586
00:27:56,130 --> 00:27:56,530
Go.

587
00:27:58,300 --> 00:27:59,010
-Don't run! -Stop!

588
00:27:59,540 --> 00:27:59,980
Stop!

589
00:28:00,020 --> 00:28:00,620
Stop!

590
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:02,310
Stop right there!

591
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:05,540
Song Chai,

592
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:06,850
you're rich!

593
00:28:07,070 --> 00:28:08,460
Do you find a better owner

594
00:28:08,650 --> 00:28:10,060
to sell that woman for a big price?

595
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:11,270
That's why you tricked us?

596
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:13,030
No.

597
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:14,340
I won it.

598
00:28:14,670 --> 00:28:15,410
You?

599
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:16,750
You lost all your money.

600
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:18,000
You never win.

601
00:28:18,870 --> 00:28:19,720
Cut the crap.

602
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:20,260
Do it.

603
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:21,350
Give it to me.

604
00:28:21,410 --> 00:28:22,620
No, no, no.

605
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:25,500
Don't try to run away.

606
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:26,240
No!

607
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:38,220
The General of the Imperial Guards is here.

608
00:28:38,470 --> 00:28:40,080
Surrender now!

609
00:28:41,170 --> 00:28:41,930
You?

610
00:28:42,330 --> 00:28:43,250
The General of the Imperial Guards?

611
00:28:43,950 --> 00:28:45,740
Aren't you Song Chai's accomplice?

612
00:28:58,780 --> 00:28:59,180
Song Chai!

613
00:28:59,590 --> 00:29:00,150
Stop running!

614
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:08,170
Who's there?

615
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:09,990
How dare you break the curfew?

616
00:29:11,210 --> 00:29:11,890
Stop!

617
00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:13,500
Those who break the curfew shall stop,

618
00:29:13,890 --> 00:29:14,940
or you'll be killed.

619
00:29:15,590 --> 00:29:16,270
I won it.

620
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:17,700
No one can take it.

621
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:21,210
Stop the arrows!

622
00:29:38,180 --> 00:29:38,730
General.

623
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:39,330
You...

624
00:29:40,410 --> 00:29:41,730
General, I...

625
00:29:58,020 --> 00:29:58,780
Lu Lingfeng,

626
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:01,520
you've been obstructing my investigation.

627
00:30:01,820 --> 00:30:03,460
I'm going to report you.

628
00:30:05,150 --> 00:30:07,220
You're just a sheriff of Chang'an.

629
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:09,880
How dare you accuse me?

630
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:12,820
I'll report you to Her Highness.

631
00:30:16,330 --> 00:30:18,010
When did you get close to Her Highness?

632
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:20,430
It's none of your business.

633
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:32,380
Why was Su Wuming there?

634
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:35,080
Did he also know

635
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:38,850
that Song Chai was a gambler

636
00:30:40,130 --> 00:30:42,230
and kept an eye on him?

637
00:30:58,300 --> 00:30:59,620
He was shot by the Imperial Guards.

638
00:30:59,930 --> 00:31:00,830
I saw it with my own eyes.

639
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:02,140
You don't need to

640
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,270
pretend to examine the body.

641
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:14,580
I only found this fatal arrow,

642
00:31:14,610 --> 00:31:17,250
but I didn't find the missed one.

643
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:18,290
General,

644
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:20,380
shouldn't you give me an explanation?

645
00:31:24,660 --> 00:31:25,440
Explain what?

646
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:30,000
If my memory serves me right,

647
00:31:30,270 --> 00:31:32,150
if there is someone breaking the curfew,

648
00:31:32,350 --> 00:31:34,060
the Imperial Guards should first

649
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:36,060
pluck the string to give him a warning.

650
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:37,900
If he doesn't stop,

651
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:40,330
shoot on the ground in front him and warn him again.

652
00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:42,120
If he still runs,

653
00:31:42,850 --> 00:31:45,090
they can finally shoot him dead.

654
00:31:45,130 --> 00:31:45,730
So I wonder

655
00:31:46,010 --> 00:31:47,380
how many arrows

656
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:49,690
did the Imperial Guards use to kill Song Chai?

657
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:55,260
This person is highly related to the Dou case.

658
00:31:55,290 --> 00:31:56,780
I wanted to capture him alive,

659
00:31:57,220 --> 00:31:58,940
but he was shot dead directly

660
00:31:59,140 --> 00:32:00,700
by the Imperial Guards.

661
00:32:01,950 --> 00:32:02,820
What's the purpose?

662
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:03,460
Su Wuming.

663
00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:05,060
You're just a sheriff of Chang'an.

664
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:06,280
How dare you accuse the Imperial Guards?

665
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:11,910
General Lu is prestigious.

666
00:32:13,870 --> 00:32:15,590
You must think that the Imperial Guards are

667
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:17,670
the closest to His Majesty.

668
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:19,620
Therefore,

669
00:32:19,820 --> 00:32:22,270
you should share the burden for His Majesty.

670
00:32:22,310 --> 00:32:24,230
If you order others around

671
00:32:24,250 --> 00:32:25,660
in the name of His Majesty... -How dare you!

672
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:34,010
How audacious you are!

673
00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:36,940
Although I am

674
00:32:36,970 --> 00:32:39,050
just a eighth-rank sheriff,

675
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:40,920
but still an official of Tang.

676
00:32:41,180 --> 00:32:42,540
No matter how high your rank is,

677
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:44,160
you're just a guard.

678
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:47,620
This is the county of Chang'an,

679
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,810
not a place for palace guards like you to act tough.

680
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:53,790
Leave now!

681
00:32:59,260 --> 00:32:59,740
Leave!

682
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:07,050
It was wrong for the Imperial Guards

683
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:08,660
to kill Song Cai.

684
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:10,340
But they did that in emergency,

685
00:33:10,550 --> 00:33:11,800
not on purpose.

686
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:13,820
You don't have to

687
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:15,460
make a big fuss.

688
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:17,300
Sheriff Su.

689
00:33:26,050 --> 00:33:27,490
Song Chai was a gambler.

690
00:33:28,780 --> 00:33:29,900
You also noticed that, right?

691
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:35,350
Back then, I found that he

692
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:37,820
had calluses on his right index finger and middle finger.

693
00:33:37,950 --> 00:33:40,350
So I deduced there must be calluses

694
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:41,890
on his thumb.

695
00:33:42,530 --> 00:33:43,630
Only old gamblers

696
00:33:43,660 --> 00:33:45,980

My sister shouldn't

871
00:41:17,470 --> 00:41:18,460
marry this scumbag.

872
00:41:19,250 --> 00:41:21,450
The brother of the bride Dou Cong,

873
00:41:22,090 --> 00:41:23,340
Dou Yulin.

874
00:41:24,390 --> 00:41:25,880
[Dou's Residence]

875
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:30,220
Please.

876
00:41:35,140 --> 00:41:36,660
General Lu, Sheriff Su,

877
00:41:36,940 --> 00:41:38,150
have you caught the murderer?

878
00:41:38,420 --> 00:41:39,580
Where is Dou Yulin?

879
00:41:42,570 --> 00:41:43,130
Sir.

880
00:41:45,380 --> 00:41:45,860
Sir.

881
00:41:48,580 --> 00:41:49,340
Look...

882
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:53,910
Yulin has been too sad recently,

883
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:55,140
crying every night.

884
00:41:55,890 --> 00:41:57,060
He must be asleep.

885
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:58,280
I came here this morning.

886
00:41:58,500 --> 00:41:59,920
I saw him have a bowl of porridge.

887
00:42:02,690 --> 00:42:03,290
Knock the door open.

888
00:42:07,570 --> 00:42:08,880
Sir!

889
00:42:22,580 --> 00:42:26,680
♫The storm rises with no reason♫

890
00:42:27,350 --> 00:42:29,730
♫In the night of illusions♫

891
00:42:31,380 --> 00:42:33,190
♫I go into the maze♫

892
00:42:35,300 --> 00:42:40,080
♫In a world of prosperity♫

893
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:43,220
♫A heart burns with obsession♫

894
00:42:44,220 --> 00:42:46,170
♫With the darkness rising♫

895
00:42:47,570 --> 00:42:53,220
♫I can't stop wandering through the night♫

896
00:42:54,050 --> 00:43:00,220
♫With light in my heart, I'm not afraid of the storm♫

897
00:43:00,580 --> 00:43:04,300
♫It's because of justice♫

898
00:43:07,020 --> 00:43:12,880
♫That I seek a truth for this long, lonely night♫

899
00:43:13,660 --> 00:43:19,560
♫The heaven and earth are held together by a strong will♫

900
00:43:20,540 --> 00:43:22,330
♫The people are in peace♫

901
00:43:22,550 --> 00:43:26,700
♫Carving right and wrong into a clear heart♫

902
00:43:27,330 --> 00:43:28,540
♫The truth♫

903
00:43:28,980 --> 00:43:32,040
♫Will reinterpret this justice♫

904
00:43:34,100 --> 00:43:38,390
♫Even if there is a fog♫

905
00:43:38,830 --> 00:43:41,180
♫Even if there are invisible waves♫

906
00:43:42,780 --> 00:43:44,770
♫I'll tell the story of the fate♫

907
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:51,310
♫Tell the love of the world♫

908
00:43:52,590 --> 00:43:54,790
♫Remember the memory of grace♫

909
00:43:55,710 --> 00:43:58,020
♫The resentment is not yet over♫

910
00:43:59,050 --> 00:44:04,490
♫The rivers and mountains are immortal, the clouds are overturned♫

911
00:44:05,410 --> 00:44:11,620
♫To be consoled by the truth, even with thorns on my back♫

912
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:16,340
♫Only for justice♫

913
00:44:18,310 --> 00:44:24,590
♫I seek a truth for this long, lonely night♫

914
00:44:24,860 --> 00:44:30,760
♫The heaven and the earth are held together by a strong will♫

915
00:44:31,790 --> 00:44:33,850
♫The people are in peace♫

♫Carving right and wrong into a clear heart♫ ♫The truth♫

917

♫The truth♫

918
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:44,170
♫Will reinterpret this justice♫

919
00:44:44,410 --> 00:44:50,510
♫Even if there are a thousand sails, it's not a waste of time♫

920
00:44:50,940 --> 00:44:57,120
♫What I am afraid of is the unrighted wrong♫

921
00:44:57,690 --> 00:44:59,600
♫What is the meaning of life and death♫

922
00:44:59,820 --> 00:45:03,960
♫I'll paint the sunshine into the landscape♫

923
00:45:04,270 --> 00:45:05,990
♫The spirit of righteousness♫

924
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:09,650
♫Exists for the one I care♫
