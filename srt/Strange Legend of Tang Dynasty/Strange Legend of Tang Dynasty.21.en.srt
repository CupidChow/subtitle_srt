4
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:51,130
Why hasn't Chicken Fed come back yet?

5
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:54,229
He's still smelling that cloth.

6
00:01:54,970 --> 00:01:56,520
He's determined to help you win the bet

7
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:58,220
so that he can drink for three days.

8
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:03,560
Hey, how's it going?

9
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:05,470
I talked to two people today.

10
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:06,700
One of them met an old man,

11
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:08,330
and the other an old woman.

12
00:02:10,169 --> 00:02:11,009
Unfortunately,

13
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,350
neither of them saw clearly

14
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:13,140
the face of the suspect.

15
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:14,850
But it's okay.

16
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:16,690
The old officer said that he would bring another two people

17
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:17,960
to meet me tomorrow.

18
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:22,870
What about you?

19
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:25,110
Why didn't you report to me

20
00:02:25,130 --> 00:02:26,700
the progress you've made on the case?

21
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:31,210
No progress so far.

22
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:35,800
That's all?

23
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,810
Give me some details.

24
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:40,270
I had a clue.

25
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:42,300
Lady Hui's mother told me Lady Hui had a headache

26
00:02:42,329 --> 00:02:43,329
and went to the Hall of Life for acupuncture.

27
00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:46,280
But there wasn't her information

28
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:47,579
in the medical journal.

29
00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:50,200
Besides,

30
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,870
that Dr. Zhai and his assistant

31
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:53,980
behaved strangely.

32
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,280
Is the medical journal in the front hall?

33
00:02:58,610 --> 00:02:59,320
Take me there.

34
00:03:02,690 --> 00:03:03,240
Follow me.

35
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:19,220
The records of the day before the Winter Solstice

36
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:20,240
were written later.

37
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:22,320
At least later than the Winter Solstice.

38
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:26,110
Are you sure?

39
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:28,050
I can tell when something was written from the color of the ink since I was three.

40
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:29,250
I'm certain of it.

41
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:32,460
I'll confess!

42
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:35,060
Lady Hui came here.

43
00:03:35,450 --> 00:03:36,260
The medical journal

44
00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:38,190
was rewritten by Dr. Zhai.

45
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:41,970
I didn't tell you

46
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:45,950
because I was too embarrassed.

47
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:48,410
Lady Hui came to see me because of headache

48
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:50,130
a few months ago.

49
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:52,690
She came here every four days for acupuncture.

50
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:54,640
The day before the Winter Solstice…

51
00:03:56,370 --> 00:03:56,840
Hey.

52
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:01,500
We have many patients today.

53
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,310
There are about four patients before you.

54
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,810
I'm afraid you need to wait for a while.

55
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:09,020
But the headache is killing me.

56
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,410
If you don't treat me now,

57
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:14,170
this may be the last time you saw me.

58
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:17,290
Stop staring.

59
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:18,180
Idiot.

60
00:04:18,610 --> 00:04:19,720
Go inside to attend the patients.

61
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:35,620
Why don't we go to the storeroom

62
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,100
in the backyard as we did last time?

63
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:39,060
I'll go meet you there

64
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:40,909
after I treat the waiting patients.

65
00:04:48,909 --> 00:04:49,980
The archway is not locked.

66
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:51,250
Here is the key to the storeroom.

67
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:53,720
You often took her

68
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:54,670
to the storeroom in the backyard?

69
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:55,670
Yes.

70
00:04:56,050 --> 00:04:57,640
I was bewitched by her beauty.

71
00:04:59,140 --> 00:04:59,740
I was wrong.

72
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:00,630
What happened that day?

73
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:03,770
That day, I...

74
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:15,060
Lady Hui.

75
00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:16,340
I'm here.

76
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:22,250
Lady Hui.

77
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:24,730
Lady Hui.

78
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:33,260
I thought

79
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:36,409
she must have found the tomb

80
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:37,320
and ran away.

81
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,770
I was thinking about telling her

82
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:41,220
to keep it a secret for me

83
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:42,530
when she came next time.

84
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:45,080
But soon I heard

85
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:46,500
that human remains were found in the Radiance Temple.

86
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:47,730
Rumors had it

87
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:50,409
that Lady Hui's body was chopped up.

88
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:53,950
I was afraid of being suspected.

89
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:55,960
Moreover,

90
00:05:57,250 --> 00:05:58,680
my affair with her

91
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:01,130
was too embarrassing.

92
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:03,050
Therefore,

93
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:05,780
I rewrote the medical journal.

94
00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:07,680
But at that time,

95
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:09,800
the thug hiding in the attic,

96
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:10,460
Liang Sanqi,

97
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:12,110
had been found by Sheriff Lu

98
00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:13,140
and died.

99
00:06:13,730 --> 00:06:14,800
I don't think Lady Hui was murdered

100
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:16,000
in the Hall of Life.

101
00:06:16,890 --> 00:06:18,510
Maybe it happened after she ran out.

102
00:06:23,890 --> 00:06:25,430
How long did you stay

103
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:26,380
in the backyard that day?

104
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:28,190
Not long.

105
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:29,830
I was about to perform acupuncture on a patient

106
00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:31,220
when Dr. Zhai came back

107
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:32,790
and did it himself.

108
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:33,700
What about that evening?

109
00:06:34,450 --> 00:06:36,300
Did Dr. Zhai go home on time?

110
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:36,880
Yes.

111
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,200
He came back for dinner

112
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:40,630
and I washed his feet after it.

113
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,159
Fed,

114
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:56,530
have you found anything?

115
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:57,380
Go away.

116
00:06:57,980 --> 00:06:58,409
Fed.

117
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:01,400
Good for you, Lu Lingfeng.

118
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:03,310
How dare you trick me?

119
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:06,120
That cloth has the scents of eight kinds of herbs

120
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:07,700
which are all strong ones.

121
00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:09,780
No one dares drink the liquor

122
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,160
mixed with all of them.

123
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:12,300
Be honest with me.

124
00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:14,380
What was that cloth used for?

125
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:21,340
It was used to wrap body parts.

126
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:23,070
Body parts?

127
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:25,410
Fed!

128
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:28,380
You're no good either!

129
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:31,520
Those eight herbs

130
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:33,100
can't be added to the liquor together.

131
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:34,490
Then what's the respective effects of them?

132
00:07:35,590 --> 00:07:38,780
They can all help with the flow of blood and vital energy.

133
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:40,990
They can be used to cure headaches,

134
00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:42,590
but no one

135
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:44,300
uses them together at the same time.

136
00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:45,840
Maybe Old Weirdo Meng

137
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:46,620
would have the guts to do that.

138
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:51,010
You mean Meng Donglao?

139
00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:53,150
Yes.

140
00:07:53,659 --> 00:07:54,620
So what?

141
00:07:55,290 --> 00:07:56,950
Didn't you say he died long ago?

142
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,320
Lu Lingfeng,

143
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:00,480
why did you choose

144
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:01,550
to live in this place?

145
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:03,410
It's creepy here.

146
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,870
You must have stayed in the Ghost Market for so long

147
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:07,210
that everywhere else becomes creepy in your eyes.

148
00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:09,730
The Ghost Market is different.

149
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:11,810
I felt cozy there.

150
00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:12,820
But this place

151
00:08:13,290 --> 00:08:14,530
gave me goosebumps

152
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:16,410
once I walked through the gate.

153
00:08:18,090 --> 00:08:18,730
Let's go.

154
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,120
Let's find a place to drink.

155
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:21,220
I'd rather lie on the street

156
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:22,300
in a drunken stupor.

157
00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:23,370
Let's go.

158
00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:24,890
Move!

159
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:38,210
Turn around!

160
00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:43,039
Step forward!

161
00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:46,410
Raise your leg!

162
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,160
Miss Xijun.

163
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:55,200
Master Fed didn't come back last night?

164
00:08:56,530 --> 00:08:57,560
He wouldn't come back no matter what,

165
00:08:57,900 --> 00:08:59,250
so I arranged him to sleep

166
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:00,350
in the county government for the night.

167
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,140
Did he tell you

168
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:03,410
his relationship with Meng Donglao?

169
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:04,420
No.

170
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:06,370
He wouldn't talk about it.

171
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,110
I was surprised

172
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:11,330
to know Master Fed had an old acquaintance

173
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,540
in Ju County of Nanzhou.

174
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:15,320
Unfortunately, that man passed away.

175
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:16,800
Otherwise,

176
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:18,230
we could ask him

177
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:19,270
what Master Fed was like

178
00:09:19,290 --> 00:09:20,050
when he was young.

179
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:32,140
Fed.

180
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:33,570
You're awake?

181
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:35,850
You drank so much last night.

182
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:36,820
I thought

183
00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:38,200
you must be snoring in sound sleep at this moment.

184
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:39,430
Lu Lingfeng,

185
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:42,120
can you tell me

186
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:44,200
where Meng Donglao's tomb is?

187
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:46,040
I wanna go pay him a visit.

188
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:48,340
He keeps showing up in my dreams.

189
00:09:49,010 --> 00:09:50,820
I'm too scared to fall asleep.

190
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:51,530
No way.

191
00:09:58,450 --> 00:09:59,680
You haven't told me

192
00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:01,260
your relationship with him.

193
00:10:07,570 --> 00:10:08,670
Fine.

194
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:09,870
I'll tell you.

195
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,080
He was my elder fellow.

196
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:14,350
Happy now?

197
00:10:14,970 --> 00:10:16,500
If I hadn't come to Ju County,

198
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:17,380
I wouldn't bother with that.

199
00:10:17,690 --> 00:10:18,480
But now that I'm here,

200
00:10:18,650 --> 00:10:20,370
and have visited his Hall of Life,

201
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:23,160
it'll be utterly improper

202
00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:25,200
if I don't go pay him my respects.

203
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:28,610
Fed,

204
00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:30,350
Meng Donglao

205
00:10:30,890 --> 00:10:32,070
was buried far away.

206
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,600
You have to travel dozens of miles to get there.

207
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:36,180
How about

208
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:38,180
we take you there

209
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:40,000
after finding the ripper?

210
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:41,710
No.

211
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:42,390
It's decided.

212
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:43,820
Xue Huan's suggestion is good.

213
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:44,740
Fed,

214
00:10:45,290 --> 00:10:46,770
I promised the magistrate to find

215
00:10:46,810 --> 00:10:48,060
the ripper within a week.

216
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:49,270
You don't want to see me

217
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:50,150
lose my position, right?

218
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:50,610
No.

219
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:53,670
It's not like you have to go with me.

220
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:55,490
I can go by myself.

221
00:10:55,850 --> 00:10:57,840
Just tell me where his tomb is.

222
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:01,900
It's in the northwest of Ju County.

223
00:11:02,410 --> 00:11:03,780
There's a Shou Mountain forty miles away from here.

224
00:11:04,810 --> 00:11:06,410
Meng Donglao was a famous local doctor.

225
00:11:06,770 --> 00:11:07,920
Go and ask around.

226
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:08,980
Everyone knows him.

227
00:11:09,050 --> 00:11:10,610
Great.

228
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:18,620
Xue Huan,

229
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,680
you lied without a blush.

230
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:24,650
Then do you want to me get him back

231
00:11:24,930 --> 00:11:25,740
and tell him the truth?

232
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:26,360
No.

233
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:29,510
Miss Xijun lives in the Hall of Life.

234
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:31,830
If she knows

235
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:33,460
the tomb is in the attic,

236
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:36,050
she'll be scared.

237
00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:50,570
[Radiance Temple]

238
00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:54,830
[Destiny Temple]

239
00:11:56,730 --> 00:11:58,500
[Greenery Temple]

240
00:12:05,170 --> 00:12:05,780
Sheriff Lu,

241
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:07,060
you're back at the right time.

242
00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:08,370
I was looking for you.

243
00:12:10,090 --> 00:12:10,600
What's wrong?

244
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:13,550
Miss Pei is a genius.

245
00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:14,490
She drew the portraits?

246
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,460
Can't believe the murderer

247
00:12:22,070 --> 00:12:23,450
had so many accomplices.

248
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:25,260
I thought so at first,

249
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:26,740
but after I compared these four paintings

250
00:12:26,770 --> 00:12:27,530
with each other,

251
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:29,680
I found these people had many things in common.

252
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:31,820
They are all thin and hunchbacked.

253
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:32,900
How do you know?

254
00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:34,760
Mr. Lu found more people

255
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:35,990
who met the suspects.

256
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:37,660
He suspects that it was one man

257
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:39,120
who dressed up differently

258
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:41,080
and put four bags of body parts

259
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,070
in four temples.

260
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:45,120
That's also my guess.

261
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:46,750
So I picked out

262
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:47,340
the features

263
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:48,390
these four people have in common

264
00:12:48,590 --> 00:12:49,460
and drew a new portrait.

265
00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:00,830
He looks familiar to me.

266
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:01,940
I seem to have met him before.

267
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:03,740
I find this guy

268
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:06,120
familiar too,

269
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,600
but I can't remember who he is.

270
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:09,630
Bastard!

271
00:13:10,010 --> 00:13:10,970
Stop there!

272
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:12,390
You have no idea

273
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:13,580
where Old Weirdo Meng's tomb is.

274
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:15,150
I'll teach his cold-hearted nephew

275
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:15,940
a lesson for him!

276
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:16,690
Fed.

277
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:18,220
Fed!

278
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:19,830
Why are you beating me?

279
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:20,650
Why?

280
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:21,710
I'm beating you

281
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:22,880
because you're a little rat

282
00:13:23,290 --> 00:13:24,960
who tricked me into traveling dozens of miles of hilly roads.

283
00:13:25,010 --> 00:13:26,330
I couldn't even feel my legs!

284
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:27,730
I'll beat you to a pulp!

285
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:29,750
Enough, Fed.

286
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:31,200
It was my idea.

287
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:33,180
Your idea?

288
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:33,860
Let's talk inside.

289
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:34,430
You…

290
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:35,050
Fed.

291
00:13:35,070 --> 00:13:35,860
How could you do this to me?

292
00:13:36,110 --> 00:13:37,620
I understand. Calm down.

293
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:38,430
Have some water.

294
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:39,310
I prefer liquor.

295
00:13:52,910 --> 00:13:53,740
What's wrong, Fed?

296
00:13:55,450 --> 00:13:56,210
Xijun,

297
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:57,740
did you draw this?

298
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:58,560
Yes.

299
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:00,700
You know

300
00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:02,380
I miss my elder fellow very much

301
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:04,020
and drew his portrait

302
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:05,020
for me?

303
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:06,300
What did you say?

304
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:08,030
The man in the painting

305
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:09,690
is Meng Donglao?

306
00:14:09,930 --> 00:14:10,930
Yes.

307
00:14:11,490 --> 00:14:13,020
Although we haven't met for decades,

308
00:14:13,050 --> 00:14:14,140
I'm sure Old Weirdo Meng

309
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:15,370
would look like this

310
00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:17,260
if he were still alive.

311
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:18,300
I remember him now.

312
00:14:18,770 --> 00:14:20,200
I found him familiar

313
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:22,960
because he looks like old Dr. Meng.

314
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:24,560
Exactly!

315
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:26,060
After catching the bad guy that day,

316
00:14:26,170 --> 00:14:27,090
I went into the attic too.

317
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:28,700
He looks just like the man

318
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:29,740
in the portrait behind the tomb!

319
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:31,380
Tomb?

320
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:33,780
Where is Old Weirdo Meng's tomb?

321
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:57,130
[The Grave of Meng Donglao]

322
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,140
Elder fellow,

323
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:05,790
your tomb is here!

324
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:08,120
No wonder you came to my dreams.

325

I'm Handsome Fed.

326
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:14,550
I came to pay you my respects.

327
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:33,540
Master.

328
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:35,740
How could you, Meng Donglao?

329
00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:37,150
You were indeed a weirdo!

330
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:38,450
A weirdo!

331
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:39,950
A weirdo!

332
00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:40,510
Fed.

333
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:42,680
He was an asshole.

334
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:48,150
He made our master here to keep vigil for him.

335
00:15:49,010 --> 00:15:49,490
That…

336
00:15:50,490 --> 00:15:52,510
That's the figurine of Sun Simiao, the King of Medicine?

337
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:54,550
Exactly.

338
00:15:55,450 --> 00:15:56,990
You were Sun Simiao's disciple?

339
00:15:57,830 --> 00:15:58,740
Yeah.

340
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:00,790
Mr. Sun accepted 13 disciples

341
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:02,890
before he died.

342
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:05,570
My nickname is Fed Thirteen

343
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:06,480
not because

344
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:07,840
I'm the thirteenth child in my family,

345
00:16:08,310 --> 00:16:09,290
but because I'm the youngest

346
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:10,250
among all the 13 disciples.

347
00:16:16,990 --> 00:16:18,850
His original name was not Meng Donglao,

348
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:20,680
but Meng Dongxiao.

349
00:16:21,930 --> 00:16:23,360
He had gray hair at a very young age,

350
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,190
so we called him

351
00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:27,560
Donglao, which means old, for fun.

352
00:16:28,410 --> 00:16:30,390
He had used that name since then.

353
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:31,990
But I

354
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:33,940
only called him Old Weirdo Meng.

355
00:16:34,830 --> 00:16:37,040
He was so talented,

356
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:39,880
but he was weird too.

357
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:41,380
How?

358
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:43,860
We helped Mr. Sun collect all kinds of medicinal materials.

359
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:44,940
Meng Donglao

360
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:46,330
was in charge of

361
00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:48,000
catching scorpions and centipedes.

362
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:49,790
It was strange

363
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:51,100
that those poisonous insects

364
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:52,750
all went still

365
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:54,940
at the sight of him.

366
00:16:56,210 --> 00:16:57,460
He was a loner,

367
00:16:58,070 --> 00:16:59,550
reticent all the time.

368
00:17:00,170 --> 00:17:01,860
No one liked him,

369
00:17:02,170 --> 00:17:04,170
but he was relatively close to me,

370
00:17:04,430 --> 00:17:06,240
the youngest disciple.

371
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,040
Meng Donglao must have been downhearted

372
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:10,670
to return to so remote a place

373
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:12,460
like Ju County.

374
00:17:12,730 --> 00:17:14,740
He had no other choices.

375
00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:17,910
He was expelled by Mr. Sun.

376
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,210
Why?

377
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:22,089
What he did

378
00:17:22,450 --> 00:17:23,930
piqued Mr. Sun.

379
00:17:24,450 --> 00:17:25,089
What did he do?

380
00:17:29,330 --> 00:17:30,410
He was my elder fellow.

381
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:31,590
I shouldn't speak ill of him.

382
00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:32,790
You must tell us.

383
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,220
It's very important.

384
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:39,930
In order to understand human meridians,

385
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:40,840
he...

386
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:42,340
he...

387
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:45,790
he stole bodies from graves.

388
00:17:48,410 --> 00:17:49,920
That's a felony

389
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:50,850
in every dynasty.

390
00:17:51,110 --> 00:17:52,750
Mr. Sun was mercy enough

391
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:54,150
to not report him

392
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:55,340
to the government.

393
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,470
I tipped Mr. Sun off about that,

394
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:59,670
so Meng Donglao had hated me since then.

395
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:01,810
I planned

396
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:03,850
to find him before I die

397
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:06,010
and make peace with him.

398
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:07,760
But unexpectedly,

399
00:18:08,950 --> 00:18:10,170
he died long ago.

400
00:18:12,890 --> 00:18:13,750
He loved cats?

401
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:15,630
Yes.

402
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:17,160
He was always

403
00:18:17,410 --> 00:18:18,940
cold and unapproachable,

404
00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:20,300
but he was very attentive

405
00:18:20,690 --> 00:18:21,940
to his cats.

406
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:25,850
Did you notice

407
00:18:26,210 --> 00:18:28,170
the cats by the tomb just now?

408
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:29,560
What colors were they?

409
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:31,530
There was a black one,

410
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:34,520
maybe a yellow one too.

411
00:18:34,970 --> 00:18:36,130
One was yellow and white.

412
00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:37,240
One was all white.

413
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:39,820
During the autopsy,

414
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:42,130
I found five kinds of cat hair.

415
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:44,770
Three yellow, one black, and one white.

416
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:47,990
This place is indeed creepy.

417
00:18:48,290 --> 00:18:48,840
You can't stay here any longer.

418
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,810
You guys move to the county government.

419
00:18:51,810 --> 00:18:52,490
Why?

420
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:53,630
I'm not afraid.

421
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:54,990
Pack up and move out now!

422
00:18:58,270 --> 00:18:58,790
Xue Huan.

423
00:19:00,150 --> 00:19:01,140
Protect her.

424
00:19:02,130 --> 00:19:03,170
Stay with her round the clock.

425
00:19:03,470 --> 00:19:03,930
Yes.

426
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:39,660
Sir,

427
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:41,270
Miss Xijun brought you food.

428
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:43,680
You didn't let us stay here,

429
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:44,860
but you stayed here all night.

430
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:45,940
Why?

431
00:19:46,350 --> 00:19:47,400
I figured out

432
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:48,170
something last night.

433
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:51,050
Liang Sanqi committed suicide

434
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:53,560
in order to keep someone's secret.

435
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:55,460
And that someone

436
00:19:56,990 --> 00:19:58,580
should be Meng Donglao.

437
00:20:02,130 --> 00:20:02,680
I've decided

438
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:04,730
to open the tomb.

439
00:20:06,530 --> 00:20:07,190
What?

440
00:20:07,530 --> 00:20:08,900
A tomb in the house?

441
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:10,990
How is that possible?

442
00:20:11,190 --> 00:20:12,700
You must be mistaken.

443
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:14,590
I know it's unbelievable,

444
00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:16,390
but that's the truth.

445
00:20:17,970 --> 00:20:19,170
Magistrate, opening the tomb is a serious matter,

446
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:21,800
so I came to ask for your permission.

447
00:20:22,910 --> 00:20:24,210
And I suspect

448
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:26,100
that Meng Donglao is still alive,

449
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:27,620
and that he's very likely

450
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:29,040
to be the ripper.

451
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:30,900
Very likely?

452
00:20:32,890 --> 00:20:35,280
Then he's also unlikely to be the ripper.

453
00:20:35,650 --> 00:20:36,870
You must think twice

454
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:38,490
before you do something

455
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:40,210
so unconventional and unscrupulous.

456
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:42,390
Besides,

457
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:45,140
the street where the Hall of Life is located

458
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:47,390
is the most prosperous in Ju County.

459
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:49,890
If people know

460
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:51,690
there is a tomb in one of the buildings there,

461
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,430
that street will be deserted

462
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:54,500
in a blink of an eye.

463
00:20:55,050 --> 00:20:56,040
If the word gets spread,

464
00:20:56,690 --> 00:20:59,150
my reputation will be ruined.

465
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:00,450
That's right.

466
00:21:02,910 --> 00:21:03,630
Lu Lingfeng,

467
00:21:04,370 --> 00:21:05,730
my friend,

468
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:07,690
I beg you.

469
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:09,870
If I really give you the permission to do that,

470
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,990
I'm afraid I'll lose my job.

471
00:21:13,930 --> 00:21:15,280
If there's nothing unusual about Meng Donglao's tomb,

472
00:21:16,390 --> 00:21:17,230
I, Lu Lingfeng,

473
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:19,060
will take full responsibility.

474
00:21:19,470 --> 00:21:19,870
No.

475
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:22,710
If you don't change your mind,

476
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:24,190
I'll have to

477
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:26,020
take you to meet the prefectural governor of Nanzhou.

478
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:27,150
You...

479
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:34,590
Fine. Don't scare civilians.

480
00:21:36,790 --> 00:21:37,550
Please,

481
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:39,180
keep it quiet.

482
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:40,470
Sheriff Lu,

483
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,100
you need to come up with a perfect plan.

484
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:48,120
[Hall of Life]

485
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:56,220
The Hall of Life is haunted by cat demons.

486
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:57,910
The government will come to snare them

487
00:21:58,350 --> 00:21:59,960
and burn them to ashes at noon.

488
00:22:00,590 --> 00:22:02,470
To prevent evil spirits from spreading,

489
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,590
no one should stay around.

490
00:22:05,330 --> 00:22:07,430
I doubt there are really cat demons,

491
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:09,970
but there are indeed many cats in the Hall of Life.

492
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:10,630
Yeah.

493
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:12,430
I saw a dozen of them

494
00:22:12,450 --> 00:22:14,250
chasing one another on the wall every day.

495
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:15,990
The new Sheriff Lu

496
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:16,780
is really brave.

497
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:18,220
He has the courage to catch cat demons.

498
00:22:18,450 --> 00:22:19,730
Officials prior to him

499
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:22,180
didn't even dare walk into that house.

500
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:23,050
That's right.

501
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:24,030
No.

502
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:25,700
No!

503
00:22:26,930 --> 00:22:27,620
Sheriff Lu,

504
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:29,440
my uncle saved numerous people

505
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:30,500
when he was alive.

506
00:22:31,050 --> 00:22:32,520
Please leave him rest in peace.

507
00:22:35,710 --> 00:22:36,300
Move!

508
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:38,570
The magistrate has given his approval.

509
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:40,150
Get out of my way,

510
00:22:44,370 --> 00:22:45,800
or I'll have to draw my sword.

511
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:47,350
Sheriff Lu.

512
00:22:47,970 --> 00:22:48,890
-Sir. -Magistrate Lei!

513
00:22:49,010 --> 00:22:50,130
-Sir. -Sheriff Lu!

514
00:22:50,430 --> 00:22:51,350
You can't do that!

515
00:22:51,390 --> 00:22:51,950
Let's go, master.

516
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:54,690
No! No!

517
00:22:55,130 --> 00:22:55,570
Open!

518
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:23,900
Lu Lingfeng.

519
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:26,810
If my uncle is inside,

520
00:23:27,410 --> 00:23:29,820
I will sue you until you are utterly discredited.

521
00:23:31,490 --> 00:23:32,710
Maybe you should think twice.

522
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:34,940
Old Weirdo Meng was indeed strange.

523
00:23:36,170 --> 00:23:36,930
But perhaps...

524
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:38,640
he really died.

525
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:39,560
Handsome Fed.

526
00:23:40,450 --> 00:23:41,210
What are you calling me?

527
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:42,910
You can't shake our morale now.

528
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:50,720
Lu Lingfeng,

529
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:53,180
trust yourself.

530
00:24:03,470 --> 00:24:05,480
Sheriff Lu, the cat demon has been killed.

531
00:24:09,430 --> 00:24:10,930
What did you burn just now?

532
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:12,690
Magistrate.

533
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:14,710
It was a huge cat-shaped thing

534
00:24:14,910 --> 00:24:15,940
made of straw.

535
00:24:16,150 --> 00:24:18,130
There was a lot of smoke.

536
00:24:20,330 --> 00:24:21,140
Okay.

537
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:23,810
Open the coffin.

538
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:46,960
Uncle.

539
00:24:47,450 --> 00:24:49,770
I'm sorry.

540
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:52,350
I failed to protect your grave.

541
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:54,310
Lu Lingfeng,

542
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:56,820
you are damned!

543
00:24:56,860 --> 00:24:57,470
Sheriff Lu.

544
00:24:57,860 --> 00:24:59,820
Didn't you say there's no one inside?

545
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:02,440
Elder fellow.

546
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:04,340
It is shocking

547
00:25:04,950 --> 00:25:06,050
that after we parted in Luoyang,

548
00:25:06,770 --> 00:25:09,590
we are now separated by life and death.

549
00:25:10,570 --> 00:25:11,570
Uncle.

550
00:25:13,230 --> 00:25:13,760
No.

551
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:15,000
This...

552
00:25:16,010 --> 00:25:17,050
This is not Old Weirdo Meng.

553
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:19,600
Fed.

554
00:25:20,090 --> 00:25:20,840
What do you mean?

555
00:25:22,330 --> 00:25:22,810
This is just

556
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:24,320
a skeleton.

557
00:25:25,890 --> 00:25:27,210
The dead turned into bones.

558
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:28,740
How could it be like this?

559
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:29,760
Besides,

560
00:25:31,130 --> 00:25:32,470
this is clearly

561
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:34,750
the skeleton of a tall female.

562
00:25:42,170 --> 00:25:42,810
You

563
00:25:43,270 --> 00:25:45,240
studied medicine with Old Weirdo Meng for years.

564
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:46,970
Can't you tell that?

565
00:25:49,170 --> 00:25:50,490
This... This...

566
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:52,840
It's indeed a female.

567
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:29,340
Xue Huan.

568
00:26:30,430 --> 00:26:31,800
There seems to be a cave

569
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:32,650
in this house abandoned for years.

570
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:37,990
It's ahead of us over there.

571
00:26:38,650 --> 00:26:39,220
Right here.

572
00:26:46,130 --> 00:26:48,880
[Underground Secret Room of the Hall of Life]

573
00:26:49,250 --> 00:26:51,190
[Hall of Life]

574
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:03,900
Lady Hui.

575
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:06,680
I won't betray you, either.

576
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:22,490
Who is so audacious?

577
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:24,670
Sheriff of Ju County.

578
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:25,960
Lu Lingfeng.

579
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:29,850
Finally, you're here.

580
00:27:30,770 --> 00:27:32,040
I knew you would come.

581
00:27:33,130 --> 00:27:34,800
I just didn't expect you to come so early

582
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:36,070
and so quickly.

583
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:40,900
Old Weirdo Meng,

584
00:27:41,470 --> 00:27:42,870
are you really alive?

585
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:47,510
Fed Thirteen?

586
00:27:48,770 --> 00:27:50,180
You came to see me, too?

587
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:51,180
Have you forgotten

588
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:54,230
why our master expelled you

589
00:27:54,450 --> 00:27:55,770
back then?

590
00:27:56,130 --> 00:27:57,290
It's been so many years.

591
00:27:58,010 --> 00:27:59,690
Why are you still

592
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:00,600
so stubborn?

593
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:04,400
You did me wrong decades ago.

594
00:28:05,230 --> 00:28:06,720
Now that you're in Ju County,

595
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:08,420
you still want to lecture me?

596
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:10,140
Shouldn't you kneel

597
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:12,000
and apologize to me, your elder fellow?

598
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:17,940
What elder fellow?

599
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:19,480
You're a murderer.

600
00:28:19,850 --> 00:28:20,940
You have no right to lecture others.

601
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:22,780
Chicken Fed, ignore him.

602
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:23,640
He...

603
00:28:27,590 --> 00:28:28,320
Meng Donglao.

604
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:30,800
These skulls

605
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:32,770
must have been sent here

606
00:28:32,790 --> 00:28:33,710
by Liang Sanqi, right?

607
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:37,180
Liang Sanqi?

608
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:39,030
I thought

609
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:41,300
he was tired of serving me for a year

610
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:42,480
so he ran away.

611
00:28:43,610 --> 00:28:45,490
It happened that you got him.

612
00:28:49,710 --> 00:28:50,230
Master,

613
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:51,640
you are indeed a prophet.

614
00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:52,820
There is really another secret passage.

615
00:28:53,970 --> 00:28:54,850
This secret passage

616
00:28:55,370 --> 00:28:57,380
was used by Liang Sanqi to send you food, drinks,

617
00:28:57,690 --> 00:28:58,950
and skulls, right?

618
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:02,100
You're right.

619
00:29:02,690 --> 00:29:04,110
A doctor is as respectable as one's parents.

620
00:29:04,410 --> 00:29:06,580
I saved Liang Sanqi's life,

621
00:29:07,170 --> 00:29:09,500
so he was loyal to me.

622
00:29:10,510 --> 00:29:11,550
You don't deserve to be a doctor.

623
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:12,920
A doctor

624
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:14,470
should be benevolent enough

625
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:15,570
to save people's lives.

626
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:16,650
But you

627
00:29:16,930 --> 00:29:17,970
killed the innocent.

628
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:19,230
How cruel!

629
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:21,380
You'll be damned to hell.

630
00:29:26,130 --> 00:29:27,290
Little girl.

631
00:29:27,610 --> 00:29:29,210
Don't you think my secret room

632
00:29:29,230 --> 00:29:30,230
is already hell?

633
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:32,560
In order to save millions of people,

634
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:35,640
I put myself in hell first.

635
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:36,400
You are crazy.

636
00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:37,650
Crazy.

637
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:39,870
How would our master teach

638
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:41,170
such an ungrateful person like you!

639
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:42,730
You are crazy!

640
00:29:43,250 --> 00:29:43,920
Meng Donglao.

641
00:29:44,610 --> 00:29:45,730
Forty years ago,

642
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:47,930
the 17-year-old Guan Zijun

643
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:50,440
was also murdered by you, right?

644
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:51,440
Yes.

645
00:29:52,370 --> 00:29:54,180
That girl was so beautiful.

646
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:55,440
Why did you dismember her?

647
00:29:57,390 --> 00:29:59,710
I wanted to have a complete skeleton

648
00:30:00,350 --> 00:30:01,480
to carry out medical research

649
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:03,030
and write the Book of Bones

650
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:04,540
so that I could cure a lot of people.

651
00:30:05,090 --> 00:30:06,160
It's been 40 years.

652
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:10,170
I've been burning incense for her every day.

653
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:12,300
Now, I put her

654
00:30:12,330 --> 00:30:13,930
in my coffin

655
00:30:14,850 --> 00:30:17,540
to thank her on behalf of all.

656
00:30:18,570 --> 00:30:19,770
Six months ago,

657
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:22,720
to cure headaches,

658
00:30:23,050 --> 00:30:24,860
I took medicine made by myself.

659
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:26,710
It could temporarily shut my breath.

660
00:30:27,130 --> 00:30:28,740
And I would be resurrected in seven days.

661
00:30:29,290 --> 00:30:31,080
My nephew is quite filial.

662
00:30:31,470 --> 00:30:33,070
He really buried me

663
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:34,500
in this attic.

664
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:39,260
Then the skeleton in front of you

665
00:30:41,730 --> 00:30:43,660
should belong to Lady Hui, right?

666
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:45,180
Yes.

667
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:46,740
Liang Sanqi

668
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:48,820
was the only one who knew the truth.

669
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:50,580
But he was a pervert.

670
00:30:51,010 --> 00:30:52,100
He only chased after

671
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:53,250
beautiful women.

672
00:30:53,770 --> 00:30:56,310
I wanted people with headaches.

673
00:30:57,450 --> 00:30:58,330
I was not satisfied with

674
00:30:58,820 --> 00:31:00,310
anyone he found for me.

675
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:05,090
Fortunately,

676
00:31:07,820 --> 00:31:08,820
here she came.

677
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:12,890
I was starving that day.

678
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:14,740
I went up through the passage

679
00:31:15,060 --> 00:31:16,380
and sneaked back to the Hall of Life.

680
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:18,970
I decided to stay in the storeroom until dusk.

681
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:20,340
After that, I would go out for food.

682
00:31:21,350 --> 00:31:22,410
I didn't expect that...

683
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:40,460
I believe that through her,

684
00:31:41,970 --> 00:31:43,250
I will find a way

685
00:31:43,650 --> 00:31:45,540
to cure headaches.

686
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:49,410
I will complete my Book of Curing Headaches

687
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:51,900
and let it pass on forever.

688
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:54,110
You abandoned her body parts in the temples

689
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:57,120
to seek comfort in your heart.

690
00:31:58,380 --> 00:31:59,940
You two officers.

691
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,240
I'll give you an opportunity

692
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:04,150
to benefit the people.

693
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:07,050
I will be executed after autumn, right?

694
00:32:07,430 --> 00:32:08,350
You just turn this place

695
00:32:08,390 --> 00:32:09,340
into a prison,

696
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:11,160
and give me some food every day.

697
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:13,060
Next autumn,

698
00:32:13,820 --> 00:32:16,170
I'll finish the Book of Curing Headaches.

699
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:18,230
By then,

700
00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:20,980
build a temple

701
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:22,640
for me,

702
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:26,920
and put a plaque saying "Reincarnation of Hua Tuo".

703
00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:42,690
What?

704
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:44,920
Don't you think I deserve a temple?

705
00:32:45,650 --> 00:32:46,700
Let me tell you.

706
00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:47,980
A thousand years later,

707
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:49,890
people will enjoy and appreciate

708
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:50,800
my work.

709
00:32:51,610 --> 00:32:52,570
No one will care about the fact

710
00:32:52,590 --> 00:32:54,470
that I was once a murderer.

711
00:32:56,710 --> 00:32:58,190
You've committed a heinous crime.

712
00:32:59,410 --> 00:33:01,400
I'm afraid you won't be able to live that long.

713
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:26,860
Master,

714
00:33:27,180 --> 00:33:28,340
Meng Donglao has been executed for his felony.

715
00:33:28,650 --> 00:33:30,470
Everyone in Ju County applauds for this.

716
00:33:45,580 --> 00:33:47,250
Meng Donglao was buried by Zhai Liang.

717
00:33:54,290 --> 00:33:54,970
It was me

718
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,480
who reported that Meng Donglao had committed a heinous crime

719
00:33:57,130 --> 00:33:59,290
in the official document to the government,

720
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:01,630
and suggested that he should be executed right away.

721
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:04,240
Was I

722
00:34:05,430 --> 00:34:06,570
right in doing that?

723
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:11,960
You doubt you did something wrong?

724
00:34:15,469 --> 00:34:16,100
I'm thinking

725
00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:18,270
what Su Wuming

726
00:34:19,570 --> 00:34:20,480
would do

727
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:22,770
if he were here.

728
00:34:34,949 --> 00:34:35,860
I've heard that you're leaving.

729
00:34:37,750 --> 00:34:38,590
It's time to leave.

730
00:34:39,050 --> 00:34:40,250
I've been here for over a month.

731
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:42,969
My sworn brother is alone in Nanzhou.

732
00:34:43,670 --> 00:34:44,770
Chicken Fed and Xue Huan

733
00:34:44,790 --> 00:34:45,699
can't go back.

734
00:34:46,230 --> 00:34:47,350
So I am the one to go back.

735
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:48,880
Why can't Fed...

736
00:34:50,179 --> 00:34:51,639
There is neither good wine

737
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:53,880
nor delicacies

738
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:54,780
here in Ju County.

739
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:55,860
You don't know

740
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:56,949
what Master Fed has been busy with

741
00:34:56,969 --> 00:34:57,640
in the past month?

742
00:35:00,490 --> 00:35:05,470
[Hall of Life]

743
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:12,820
Much better.

744
00:35:13,090 --> 00:35:15,290
You can't stop taking medicine for three days.

745
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:17,300
And you need to take acupuncture

746
00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:18,520
every two days.

747
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:20,370
Wait in the next room.

748
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:22,300
I'll give you acupuncture later.

749
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:24,910
Thank you, doctor.

750
00:35:25,550 --> 00:35:26,580
Doctor Fed.

751
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:28,630
Doctor Fed.

752
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:30,640
Doctor Fed.

753
00:35:36,570 --> 00:35:37,410
Why are you here?

754
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:38,430
Where is Carver Hu?

755
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:40,080
My father has recovered completely.

756
00:35:40,310 --> 00:35:42,300
He butchered three pigs in a row today.

757
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:44,070
I'm on my way to invite you to the feast.

758
00:35:44,180 --> 00:35:44,890
Have a drink?

759
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:47,070
Why didn't he invite me?

760
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:48,920
I'm here to invite you.

761
00:35:49,650 --> 00:35:50,740
The one who treated us

762
00:35:50,770 --> 00:35:52,370
also suffered from headaches, but you have also cured him.

763
00:35:53,050 --> 00:35:53,610
And this.

764
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:56,070
My father asked me to give it to you.

765
00:35:56,140 --> 00:35:56,900
It's fresh.

766
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:58,490
Please enjoy the feast later.

767
00:35:59,180 --> 00:36:00,370
I will.

768
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:02,410
Master, enjoy yourself.

769
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:03,870
Xiaoqi and I

770
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:04,620
will pick you up tonight.

771
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:06,250
Okay.

772
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:08,640
-Let's go. -Not bad.

773
00:36:09,510 --> 00:36:10,760
They are sending a plaque.

774
00:36:10,940 --> 00:36:11,500
Yes.

775
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:13,960
He's really an awesome doctor.

776
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:16,610
Thank you.

778
00:36:18,330 --> 00:36:20,120
Thank you, Dr. Fed.

779
00:36:21,050 --> 00:36:22,170
You're welcome.

780
00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:26,980
[Reincarnation of Hua Tuo]

781
00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:31,530
It's not worth mentioning.

782
00:36:31,710 --> 00:36:33,030
It's not appropriate

783
00:36:33,230 --> 00:36:34,560
to have this plaque here.

784
00:36:34,590 --> 00:36:35,790
The headache tortured us two

785
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:37,390
for years.

786
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:39,210
You cured us in half a month.

787
00:36:39,450 --> 00:36:41,520
You are surely the reincarnation of Hua Tuo.

788
00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:42,420
Yes.

789
00:36:42,510 --> 00:36:43,710
Dr. Handsome Fed.

790
00:36:44,170 --> 00:36:46,190
Please accept the plaque.

791
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:46,910
Take it.

792
00:36:46,940 --> 00:36:47,880
Take it, master.

793
00:36:47,910 --> 00:36:49,080
Take it.

794
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:51,400
Take it.

795
00:36:52,170 --> 00:36:52,960
This...

796
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:54,260
Handsome Fed?

797
00:36:55,290 --> 00:36:56,820
This name sounds awkward.

798
00:36:57,170 --> 00:36:57,960
I can imagine

799
00:36:58,570 --> 00:36:59,970
that when Master Fed was young,

800
00:37:00,140 --> 00:37:01,100
he definitely deserved

801
00:37:01,130 --> 00:37:01,820
this name.

802
00:37:04,190 --> 00:37:06,030
I didn't expect

803
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:07,620
that Master Fed, who idled around in the Ghost Market of Chang'an,

804
00:37:08,090 --> 00:37:09,480
was a disciple of the King of Medicine.

805
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:10,450
I also didn't expect

806
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:11,580
he would go south with me

807
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:12,760
and cure

808
00:37:12,790 --> 00:37:14,210
headaches for the people of Ju County.

809
00:37:15,490 --> 00:37:17,160
The relationships in this world

810
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:18,920
are predestined.

811
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:23,710
It seems that you are not

812
00:37:24,380 --> 00:37:25,850
only accompanied by Master Fed alone.

813
00:37:27,090 --> 00:37:28,590
The fate is indeed wonderful.

814
00:37:29,250 --> 00:37:30,800
It won't happen again if you miss it.

815
00:37:31,910 --> 00:37:32,940
For example,

816
00:37:35,570 --> 00:37:36,150
today.

817
00:37:38,230 --> 00:37:38,900

818

Why are you so frightened?

867
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:11,900
But it seems that

868
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:14,360
no one framed you.

869
00:40:15,550 --> 00:40:16,030
Rather,

870
00:40:18,010 --> 00:40:19,210
it is a decision by the imperial court.

871
00:40:22,570 --> 00:40:23,600
Chang'an.

872
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:43,980
Have a safe journey.

873
00:40:44,550 --> 00:40:45,260
Sheriff Lu.

874
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:48,630
Have a safe journey.

875
00:40:50,180 --> 00:40:51,060
Sheriff Lu.

876
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:53,160
Safe and sound.

877
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:55,000
Be safe!

878
00:40:55,030 --> 00:40:57,530
Sheriff Lu, take care.

879
00:40:58,190 --> 00:41:00,470
Take care, Sheriff Lu.

880
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:01,990
Have a safe journey.

881
00:41:03,130 --> 00:41:04,330
Safe and sound.

882
00:41:04,780 --> 00:41:06,880
Have a safe trip, Sheriff Lu.

883
00:41:10,830 --> 00:41:11,550
Brother,

884
00:41:12,270 --> 00:41:13,640
I've learned a lot

885
00:41:14,190 --> 00:41:15,560
in the past two months.

886
00:41:15,810 --> 00:41:16,700
I sincerely admire you.

887
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:19,170
I will try my best to serve people

888
00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:20,820
as long as I am a government official.

889
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:22,860
Brother Lu,

890
00:41:23,260 --> 00:41:24,350
you are upright and selfless.

891
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:25,540
You are brave and intelligent.

892
00:41:26,130 --> 00:41:27,860
Although you were dismissed,

893
00:41:28,330 --> 00:41:30,640
there will be a bright future ahead.

894
00:41:31,610 --> 00:41:32,210
Sheriff Lu,

895
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:34,540
farewell.

896
00:41:37,340 --> 00:41:38,300
Farewell.

897
00:41:45,780 --> 00:41:47,540
We are indebted to you, Sheriff Lu.

898
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:49,730
We bid farewell to you.

899
00:41:56,140 --> 00:41:57,520
Sheriff Lu.

900
00:41:58,050 --> 00:42:00,470
Have a safe journey.

901
00:42:06,870 --> 00:42:07,710
To all the people in Ju County,

902
00:42:08,270 --> 00:42:09,280
there is a long way ahead,

903
00:42:11,450 --> 00:42:12,080
we may meet each other again in the future!

904
00:42:13,780 --> 00:42:14,420
Farewell!

905
00:42:46,310 --> 00:42:50,410

♫It's because of justice♫

914

♫That I seek a truth for this long, lonely night♫

♫And the resentment is not yet over♫
