Ouyang.

Welcome. Welcome.

13
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:16,460
Mr. Lu,

14
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:19,390
I've brought the painting of the Stone Bridge

15
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:20,579
you desire.

16

00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:27,060
Are you sure?

20
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:28,140

21
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:29,550
be it Persians,

Arabians or Sogdians,

authenticating and selling jewelry.

25
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,160
I've never heard

26
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:37,050
that they would be interested in calligraphy and painting,

27
00:02:37,079 --> 00:02:38,020
not even in Chang'an,

28
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:39,360
not to mention in Nanzhou.

29
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:42,120
Besides, we were just appreciating,

30
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:43,060
not buying it.

31
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,340
Why did he lie?

32
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:47,590
I think it's related to

33
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:50,130
the deaths of Nanzhou Four Scholars one after another.

00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:52,870
this painting is ominous.

36
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:54,120

My master has solved the murder case

and sent someone to invite the Prefectural Governor and Administrator.

You must give your reason

55
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:27,170
for such a conclusion.

56

Please

57

examine the body with me.

61

The murderer has been arrested.

64
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,310
It's Lin Bao, a Guqin player.

65
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:56,230
He is only a Guqin player

66

performing in the brothel.

67
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,190
How dare he?

68
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:00,140
He has confessed.

00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:04,810
How unexpected it is.

Lu Gongfu, the Master of Guqin,

74
00:04:09,570 --> 00:04:11,410

00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,180
are also in Nanzhou Prison now.

79
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:21,620
Why are they

80
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:23,060
imprisoned there?

81
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:24,260
As for the reason,

82
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,960
we'll know after the interrogation.

83
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:35,450
Greetings, Governor Xiong and Administrator Luo.

84
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:36,730
Well...

85
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:41,900
Should I be executed?

86
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,270
If I am to be beheaded, hurry up.

87
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:45,020
I'm going to accompany Yuanfu and Gongfu.

88
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:45,860
I can't wait.

89
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:50,290
You live somewhere remote and call yourself a celebrated scholar.

90
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:52,890
But now,

91
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:54,870
you are still bossing me around.

92
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:56,430
Is there still justice

93
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:57,640
in your eyes?

94
00:04:59,310 --> 00:04:59,820
Bring him in.

95
00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:02,990
Move!

96
00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:12,190
Tu Yanpi.

97
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:13,900
Was it they two

98
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:15,280
who hired you to kill others?

99
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:18,540
Yes.

100
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:20,080
Mr. Zhong paid me,

101
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,210
and Mr. Leng gave me instructions.

102
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:22,400
What did he tell you to do?

103
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:25,440
He asked me to catch Lin Bao,

104
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:27,590
to torture him and ask him to confess,

105
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:28,960
and then write down his confession

106
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:30,770
which would be burned

107
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:32,260
on the burial day of Lu Gongfu.

108
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:34,290
Then I needed to take Lin Bao to the mourning hall,

109
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:37,030
and let them execute him.

110
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,909
Gongfu was actually murdered?

111
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:46,060
Why did you

112
00:05:46,090 --> 00:05:47,260
hide it from me?

113
00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:48,980
I...

114
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:54,000
After we drank that night,

115
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:56,140
you said you were not feeling well,

116
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:57,500
but I didn't enjoy it.

117
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:00,160
I found a tavern in the city

118
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:02,110
and drank for another two hours.

119
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:04,550
But I didn't have any drinking buddy.

120
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,070
It was so boring.

121
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,930
So I took the wine

122
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:11,220
to Brother Gongfu outside the city.

123
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:13,820
Brother Gongfu.

124
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:15,230
Why do you sleep so early?

125
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:18,610
Get up and drink with me.

126
00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:21,500
Get up. Hurry up!

127
00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:22,730
Come on. Get up.

128
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:31,440
Brother Yuanfu died of an illness.

129
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,440
And Brother Gongfu was murdered.

130
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:36,240
I know you are not in a good shape.

131
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:38,350
If I tell you that he was killed,

132
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:39,930
how can you bear it?

133
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,180
Besides,

134
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:42,610
how can Nanzhou Four Scholars

135
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:44,590
all die in accidents?

136
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:45,940
If words got out,

137
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:47,100
it would be a shame.

138
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:48,980
In order to protect the reputation of Nanzhou Four Scholars,

139
00:06:49,570 --> 00:06:51,110
I, personally,

140
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:52,270
changed clothes for Brother Gongfu.

141
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:53,450
Don't you want to

142
00:06:53,470 --> 00:06:54,390
catch the murderer

143
00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:55,790
and avenge Brother Gongfu's death?

144
00:06:55,930 --> 00:06:57,080
Why don't I?

145
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,270
Brother Gongfu was so arrogant

146
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:02,590
that he offended many people.

147
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:04,820
But I don't know

148
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:06,620
who the murder is.

149
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:09,980
Looks like we need to report this to the government.

150
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:10,970
No.

151
00:07:11,450 --> 00:07:12,490
If so, the reputation of Nanzhou Four Scholars

152
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:13,820
will be ruined.

153
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:15,830
By the way,

154
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,570
Brother Gongfu's guqin is missing.

155
00:07:18,450 --> 00:07:20,370
Could the murderer kill Brother Gongfu for the guqin?

156
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:22,930
Do you still remember

157
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,540
the day of Yuanfu's funeral?

158
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,580
Someone got in the way and wanted to be Brother Gongfu's disciple.

159
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:28,540
His name is Lin Bao.

160
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:32,680
It must be him.

161
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:34,380
It must be him.

162
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:36,220
Zhong Boqi and Leng Ji.

163
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:39,760
You two didn't report the murder,

164
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:40,990
while secretly

165
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:43,170
hired delinquents

166
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,320
and tried to lynch Lin Bao.

167
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:46,490
How should you be punished?

168
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:50,450
Governor Xiong.

169
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,159
These two are members of

170
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:53,380
the so-called Nanzhou Scholars.

171
00:07:54,030 --> 00:07:55,659
As for how to punch them,

172
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,440
it is up to you.

173
00:07:57,890 --> 00:07:58,330
I...

174
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:04,440
Zhong Boqi and Leng Ji

175
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:06,860
are really disappointing.

176
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:08,870
But they Four Scholars

177
00:08:09,850 --> 00:08:12,510
are indeed the pride of Nanzhou.

178
00:08:12,690 --> 00:08:14,120
I mean

179
00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:16,890
you don't need to be so serious.

180
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,840
If they are imprisoned,

181
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:20,210
it would

182
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,260
ruin the reputation of Nanzhou as a whole.

183
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:25,020
Yes.

184
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:28,420
Minister Lu.

185
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:31,700
Do you understand

186
00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:32,630
what Governor Xiong means?

187
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,000
Governor Xiong

188
00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:36,840
favors celebrated scholars in particular.

189
00:08:37,230 --> 00:08:38,120
I'm your subordinate.

190
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:39,030
I'll do what you say.

191
00:08:39,570 --> 00:08:40,730
I'll release them immediately.

192
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:43,720
Minister Lu,

193
00:08:43,909 --> 00:08:45,540
I was afraid that

194
00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:48,380
you were too angry to release them.

195
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:50,380
Of course not.

196
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:51,450
However,

197
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:53,220
Lu Gongfu was killed.

198
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:54,610
The details of this case

199
00:08:54,950 --> 00:08:56,070
should be revealed to the public.

200
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,370
The murderer Lin Bao must be executed in public.

201
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:01,260
It's still too early

202
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:02,740
to identify Lin Bao as the murder.

203
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:04,020
This...

204
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:04,990
What?

205
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:06,900
You don't trust me, Commander Su?

206
00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:10,510
Prefectural Governor Xiong. Administrator Luo.

207
00:09:10,810 --> 00:09:12,110
Please leave.

208
00:09:12,210 --> 00:09:13,530
And Lengji and Zhong Boqi

209
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:14,680
could also be released for the time being.

210
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:16,140
I want to

211
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:20,060
meet Lin Bao.

212
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,450
I didn't steal the Guqin.

213
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:27,340
I really didn't.

214
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:44,090
I did kill Lu Gongfu,

215
00:09:45,130 --> 00:09:47,150
but I really didn't steal the guqin.

216
00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:50,190
I've already been on the death row.

217
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:51,490
I'll just wait for death.

218
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:53,820
But please don't torture me anymore.

219
00:09:54,410 --> 00:09:55,170
Lin Bao,

220
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:57,630
I'm the new Military Commander of Nanzhou.

221
00:09:57,650 --> 00:09:58,340
Su Wuming.

222
00:09:58,460 --> 00:10:00,050
I'll only ask you three questions.

223
00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:02,810
You have to answer me honestly.

224
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:05,380
What time was it

225
00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:06,260
when you sneaked into Lu's Residence that night?

226
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:07,640
Think before you speak.

227
00:10:08,590 --> 00:10:09,480
No need.

228
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:11,740
A little past 1 a.m.

229
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:13,180
Are you sure?

230
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:15,570
When I sneaked into his courtyard,

231
00:10:16,570 --> 00:10:18,440
there was a night watcher reporting the time.

232
00:10:24,130 --> 00:10:25,930
When you sneaked into his room,

233
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:27,270
where was Lu Gongfu

234
00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:28,230
and what was he doing?

235
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:30,800
On the bed,

236
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:32,890
he was sleeping on his back.

237
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,520
Last question.

238
00:10:34,930 --> 00:10:35,870
When you

239
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:37,620
assassinated Lu Gongfu with a dagger,

240
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:38,860
what was his response?

241
00:10:39,610 --> 00:10:41,820
Remember, you must answer truthfully.

242
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:43,420
At that time, I...

243
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,270
I stabbed the dagger

244
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:46,650
into his left chest.

245
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,730
He must be dead on the spot.

246
00:10:52,590 --> 00:10:53,670
He had no response.

247
00:10:56,570 --> 00:10:57,300
That's all.

248
00:10:57,930 --> 00:10:58,530
Su Wuming.

249
00:10:58,650 --> 00:10:59,370
How do you know

250
00:10:59,570 --> 00:11:00,450
the murderer is someone else?

251
00:11:00,690 --> 00:11:01,870
If someone was stabbed

252
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:03,100
when he was alive,

253
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:05,500
the wounds would be bright and covered by wide scars.

254
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:07,100
The skin would be tight.

255
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:08,500
Also, there would be blood stasis around the wounds.

256
00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:11,250
But if the flesh was intact,

257
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:13,060
he would be stabbed after death.

258
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:13,930
Besides,

259
00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:16,060
the flesh would turn pale if someone was stabbed after death.

260
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:17,580
That's because after death,

261
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:18,870
there's no circulation of blood.

262
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,280
Don't you know that?

263
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:21,210
No.

264
00:11:22,010 --> 00:11:23,050
But you didn't examine the body.

265
00:11:23,490 --> 00:11:25,060
You just took a look from afar.

266
00:11:26,450 --> 00:11:28,290
You didn't stare at me day and night.

267
00:11:28,310 --> 00:11:29,880
How do you know I didn't examine the body?

268
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:31,220
But Lu Gongfu's body

269
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:32,600
was transported to Nanzhou Prison

270
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:33,900
after I arrested Lin Bao.

271
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:35,250
Then I kept an eye on it all the time.

272
00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:36,260
Really?

273
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:37,630
Let me ask you.

274
00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:40,250
What did the coroner say after the autopsy?

275
00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:42,370
Well...

276
00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:44,250
You didn't ask the coroner to examine the body,

277
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:44,830
right?

278
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:48,660
That day, Leng Ji didn't allow you to open the coffin,

279
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:50,530
so you wanted to catch the murderer first

280
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:51,670
and then deduced all the details of the case.

281
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:53,180
After Lin Bao confessed,

282
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:54,490
and Tu Yanpi was arrested,

283
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:55,940
you couldn't wait

284
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:58,400
to invite Governor Xiong and Commander Luo

285
00:11:58,530 --> 00:11:59,530
just for embarrassing Leng Ji

286
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:01,070
and Zhong Boqi.

287
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:02,120
Am I right?

288
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:03,900
Lu Lingfeng,

289
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:06,280
you're too arrogant.

290
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:07,940
I just wanted to...

291
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:08,700
I...

292
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:15,340
Without a coroner, you did the autopsy yourself.

293
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:16,470
Did you find

294
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,960
that there was a strangling mark on Lu Gongfu's neck?

295
00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:34,420
It started from his throat.

296
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,630
It was straight, deep and dark,

297
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:40,390
rather than starting from the hair behind his ears.

298
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:42,790
This is a way of death

299
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:44,120
caused by non-intersected ropes.

300
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:46,550
His eyelids bled.

301
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:48,100
There was cyanosis on his lips.

302
00:12:48,570 --> 00:12:50,110
There were bleeding points under his skin.

303
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:52,040
All proved that he was strangled

304
00:12:52,390 --> 00:12:54,640
by someone with something between the rope and his neck.

305
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:04,270
Military Commander Su,

306
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:06,300
as the acting Minister of Justice,

307
00:13:06,330 --> 00:13:06,930
I made a huge mistake.

308
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:08,580
Please fire me immediately.

309
00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:11,950
Lin Bao said just now

310
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:13,620
that he didn't steal the Guqin.

311
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:16,150
So...

312
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:19,430
The Guqin of the Three Kingdoms Period is still missing?

313
00:13:21,090 --> 00:13:21,570
Yes.

314
00:13:22,770 --> 00:13:23,740
I thought

315
00:13:23,930 --> 00:13:24,930
it was not directly related to this case.

316
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,110
So...

317
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:27,980
So you ignored it.

318
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:30,480
Minister Lu.

319
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:32,740
Greetings, Commander Su.

320
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:33,960
Minister Lu.

321
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:35,250
You're amazing.

322
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:36,710
You asked me to keep an eye on Ouyang Quan.

323
00:13:36,810 --> 00:13:38,430
I found that he sneaked

324
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:39,380
into the Treasure House.

325
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:40,670
When he left there,

326
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:41,780
he sighed.

327
00:13:42,090 --> 00:13:42,660
After that,

328
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:44,500
many people came to the Treasure House.

329
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:46,250
They did't look good.

330
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:47,140
Someone was even preparing a cart.

331
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:49,030
In the end, I saw

332
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:50,180
the owner of the Treasure House

333
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:51,630
got into the cart with two things.

334
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:53,510
One of them was a box

335
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:54,380
brought by Ouyang Quan.

336
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:55,300
The other

337
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:57,490
was known to all the people in Nanzhou.

338
00:13:57,860 --> 00:13:59,090
That was Lu Gongfu's

339
00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:00,380
Guqin of the Three Kingdoms Period.

340
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:06,060
Lu Lingfeng.

341
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:07,730
I thought

342
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,340
you missed

343
00:14:09,370 --> 00:14:10,400
such an important clue.

344
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:12,090
What's in the box

345
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:13,680
should be the painting of the Stone Bridge.

346
00:14:13,710 --> 00:14:14,680
To solve this case,

347
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:16,910
the painting and the Guqin are both crucial.

348
00:14:17,130 --> 00:14:17,970
Go after them!

349
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:19,410
Yes.

350
00:14:35,890 --> 00:14:36,850
Someone is chasing us here.

351
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:39,540
Heroes,

352
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:41,710
since you've taken my money,

353
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:44,000
stop these bandits

354
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:45,690
for me.

355
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:46,930
Once I get to Chang'an,

356
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:49,970
I will pay you double.

357
00:14:50,330 --> 00:14:51,900
You two go first with the cart.

358
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:53,600
The other three follow me to cover the rear.

359
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:03,110
I am the Minister of Justice of Nanzhou.

360
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,210
Step aside.

361
00:15:07,210 --> 00:15:07,770
Minister Lu.

362
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:09,220
There's no use reasoning with these guys.

363
00:15:13,010 --> 00:15:13,450
Go!

364
00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:14,170
Go!

365
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:14,660
Go!

366
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:07,920
Xie.

367
00:16:10,590 --> 00:16:11,270
Don't kill anyone.

368
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:12,480
Tie them up for interrogation.

369
00:16:16,130 --> 00:16:16,570
Come on.

370
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:20,560
-Don't move. -Stay still!

371
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:35,240
One horse is missing.

372
00:16:35,950 --> 00:16:37,370
Xue Huan, go after them!

373
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:37,890
Yes.

374
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:05,980
Don't kill me.

375
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:07,050
Don't kill me.

376
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:09,150
I'm just a carter.

377
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,420
Master, he ran that way.

378
00:17:42,610 --> 00:17:43,180
Are you okay?

379
00:17:43,390 --> 00:17:43,970
I'm fine.

380
00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:36,560
You bandit!

381
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:37,960
Kill me!

382
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:42,690
Who are you calling a bandit?

383
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:44,940
If it isn't for money,

384
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:46,280
why are you chasing me?

385
00:18:48,090 --> 00:18:49,090
All my money is here.

386
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:50,620
Just take it.

387
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:51,270
How dare you!

388
00:18:51,670 --> 00:18:53,230
I'm the Acting Minister of Justice of Nanzhou.

389
00:18:53,530 --> 00:18:54,570
Where are Lu Gongfu's Guqin

390
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:55,830
and the painting of the Stone Bridge?

391
00:18:58,210 --> 00:19:00,170
How... how would I know?

392
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:01,830
Master.

393
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:03,940
He hid them here.

394
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:05,180
Here.

395
00:19:06,850 --> 00:19:07,690
Here.

396
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:12,950
Hurry up.

397
00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:17,650
Take them away.

398
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:27,670
Hurry up.

399
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:32,720
See?

400
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:35,150
Commander Su has made a pre-trial.

401
00:19:35,530 --> 00:19:36,600
Just confess what you have done.

402
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:40,610
I... I didn't kill anyone.

403
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:45,380
I did want that painting.

404
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:46,920
But...

405
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:47,880
But...

406
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:50,770
I didn't kill anyone.

407
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:53,420
Then why did you escape from Nanzhou,

408
00:19:53,630 --> 00:19:54,920
and asked a swordsman to escort you?

409
00:19:56,150 --> 00:20:00,080
I wanted to go to Chang'an as soon as possible,

410
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:01,930
so that I could sell the painting of the Stone Bridge.

411
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:04,100
If the news of Yan Yuanfu's

412
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:05,490
and Lu Gongfu's deaths

413
00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:06,580
reached Chang'an,

414
00:20:06,910 --> 00:20:07,790
this painting

415
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:10,510
wouldn't be sold at a good price.

416
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:13,020
As for asking a swordsman to escort me,

417
00:20:13,690 --> 00:20:15,230
that's because I'm afraid

418
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:17,710
there would be bandits along the way.

419
00:20:17,770 --> 00:20:18,570
How much did you spend

420
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,400
to buy the Stone Bridge Painting?

421
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:21,500
Thirty thousand copper coins.

422
00:20:22,450 --> 00:20:23,220
Thirty thousand copper coins?

423
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:25,180
Didn't Your Honor

424
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,730
interrogate Ouyang Quan just now?

425
00:20:27,210 --> 00:20:29,410
I'm telling the truth.

426
00:20:32,850 --> 00:20:34,820
I didn't sell it

427
00:20:34,850 --> 00:20:35,600
when you offered 150,000 copper coins.

428
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:38,160
But I've had enough fun of it.

429
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:39,180
Give me another price.

430
00:20:39,670 --> 00:20:40,600
If it's suitable,

431
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:41,780
you can

432
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:43,150
have it.

433
00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:47,320
Why is here

434
00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:50,420
something else?

435
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:53,670
Here are

436
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:55,320
rocks and bamboo originally on the painting.

437
00:20:56,860 --> 00:20:58,210
Haven't you been to the Stone Bridge Mountain?

438
00:20:58,910 --> 00:20:59,410
No.

439
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:01,430
Ouyang Quan,

440
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,370
you're not trying to fool me with a counterfeit,

441
00:21:04,690 --> 00:21:05,560
are you?

442
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:10,140
Do you know anything about painting?

443
00:21:10,670 --> 00:21:11,900
Zhang Xuan's work

444
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:13,810
pays special attention to the layout

445
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:15,130
and the vividness of people.

446
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:17,130
His brush strokes are round and powerful.

447
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,380
So there must be something wrong

448
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:19,900
in the rocks and bamboo

449
00:21:20,490 --> 00:21:21,790
in the lower right corner.

450
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:28,140
To be honest,

451
00:21:28,910 --> 00:21:30,280
because I didn't store it properly,

452
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:33,530
this area was once soaked in water.

453
00:21:34,130 --> 00:21:35,180
There was water stain left.

454
00:21:35,510 --> 00:21:36,040
So,

455
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:37,760
I tried to

456
00:21:39,130 --> 00:21:39,960
make up for it.

457
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:40,720
You...

458
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:44,470
Ouyang Quan.

459
00:21:44,530 --> 00:21:45,220
Do you have any idea

460
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:46,620
about what you've done?

461
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:48,850
You ruined this masterpiece

462
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:49,930
of Zhang Xuan.

463
00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:51,670
But what has been done can't be undone.

464
00:21:51,870 --> 00:21:52,230
You...

465
00:21:52,610 --> 00:21:53,850
Just offer a price.

466
00:22:02,290 --> 00:22:03,580
Thirty thousand copper coins?

467
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,360
Lu Li, how cruel you are.

468
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:09,570
Zhang Xuan is now famous in Tang.

469
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:11,520
No?

470
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:13,470
See you.

471
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:14,230
You...

472
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:19,780
Fine, I'll sell it.

473
00:22:20,490 --> 00:22:20,950
Lu Li,

474
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:23,070
you have been seeking to buy this painting for years,

475
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:25,330
but Ouyang Quan always refused you.

476
00:22:25,790 --> 00:22:26,710
I have reason to doubt

477
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:28,330
that it was you who killed Lu Gongfu.

478
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:30,100
And then people might think

479
00:22:30,130 --> 00:22:31,370
that the Stong Bridge Painting was ominous.

480
00:22:31,890 --> 00:22:33,060
In this way, you could force Ouyang Quan

481
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:34,620
to sell his treasure to you at a low price.

482
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:35,770
No.

483
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:38,210
I really didn't kill anyone.

484
00:22:38,410 --> 00:22:39,630
How did you get

485
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:40,710
Lu Gongfu's Guqin?

486
00:22:41,130 --> 00:22:41,850
Stop lying.

487
00:22:44,930 --> 00:22:48,460
I took the Guqin back to the Treasure House

488
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:54,080
from Lu Gongfu's home.

489
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:54,870
You took it?

490
00:22:57,430 --> 00:22:58,110
I stole...

491
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:00,140
I stole it.

492
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:01,530
What happened? Tell me.

493
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:04,800
I have a lover

494
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:06,530
who lives outside the city.

495
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:09,500
It's not far from Lu Gongfu's home.

496
00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:12,910
After I left her home that night,

497
00:23:13,470 --> 00:23:15,320
[Lu's Residence]

498
00:23:13,730 --> 00:23:15,080
I happened to go past the Lu's Residence.

499
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:17,280
I was thirsty after drinking.

500
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:18,790
The door was not closed,

501
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:21,000
so I wanted to get some water.

502
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:22,780
Mr Lu.

503
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:28,630
Is Mr Lu here?

504
00:23:32,690 --> 00:23:33,810
Also go for a drink?

505
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:52,500
It's my fault.

506
00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:54,350
This is what I do.

507
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:56,640
I love antiques as much as my life.

508
00:23:58,210 --> 00:23:58,960
Lu Li.

509
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:02,780
When did you enter the Lu's Residence?

510
00:24:04,350 --> 00:24:04,900
At about four o'clock a.m.

511
00:24:06,870 --> 00:24:07,780
that day.

512
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:10,180
It should be midnight.

513
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:21,860
Lu Gongfu was strangled to death by you.

514
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:24,150
Then you dragged his body

515
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,780
into the bedroom

516
00:24:25,870 --> 00:24:29,060
and put it in a sleeping position.

517
00:24:29,170 --> 00:24:29,660
No.

518
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:31,370
No, Your Honor.

519
00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:33,310
I really went past the Lu's Residence

520
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:34,700
at about four a.m.

521
00:24:34,810 --> 00:24:36,170
My lover's surname is Mi.

522
00:24:36,410 --> 00:24:38,100
Her husband is a night watchman.

523
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:39,640
Every time I go on a date with her,

524
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:42,140
I leave at about four o'clock a.m.

525
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:43,380
Your Honor, please investigate into the case.

526
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:45,280
Please investigate into the case.

527
00:24:45,310 --> 00:24:46,430
Your Honor.

528
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:01,340
They have found the Mi

529
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:02,220
that Lu Li mentioned.

530
00:25:02,590 --> 00:25:03,750
Her husband is indeed a night watchman.

531
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:05,300
Lu Li didn't lie.

532
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:07,340
When he left Mi's house,

533
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:09,040
it was already four o'clock a.m.

534
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:14,970
This case is getting more complicated.

535
00:25:15,490 --> 00:25:16,920
The murderer may

536
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,820
have entered our sight.

537
00:25:19,050 --> 00:25:20,200
Maybe we

538
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:22,510
have missed some details.

539
00:25:22,970 --> 00:25:24,940
That's why we haven't found him.

540
00:25:31,330 --> 00:25:32,100
Su Wuming.

541
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:33,610
If it weren't for you,

542
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:36,850
I would have posted

543
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:37,910
the notice of Lin Bao's murder.

544
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:43,360
Post a notice?

545
00:25:44,830 --> 00:25:45,880
That's a good idea.

546
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:48,670
Let everyone know

547
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:49,740
the true state of Lu Gongfu's death.

548
00:25:49,810 --> 00:25:53,100
Reward those who provide clues.

549
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:55,400
Sometimes,

550
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:59,680
this is the most direct

551
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:02,520
and most effective way to solve a mysterious case.

552
00:26:03,470 --> 00:26:05,760
Those who provide clues will be rewarded with 100 copper coins.

553
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:07,420
Lu Gongfu was killed.

554
00:26:07,420 --> 00:26:07,940
He was killed?

555
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:08,730
I thought

556
00:26:08,770 --> 00:26:10,200
he died for Yan Yuanfu.

557
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:12,620
The Nanzhou Four Scholars

558
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:14,180
ended up like this.

559
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:15,960
Who will be a famous scholar in the future?

560
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:17,030
That's right.

561
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:17,820
Yes.

562
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:19,900
Look, this is the first time

563
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:21,740
to reward those who provide clues in Nanzhou.

564
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:22,380
That's right.

565
00:26:22,570 --> 00:26:23,450
It's the first time.

566
00:26:23,550 --> 00:26:24,220
What's going on?

567
00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:25,220
What is it?

568
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:27,580
Don't worry.

569
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:30,330
Have some water and tell us.

570
00:26:31,730 --> 00:26:32,130
Okay.

571
00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:39,860
It was a monk

572
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:40,960
who strangled him.

573
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:42,560
I saw it with my own eyes.

574
00:26:47,270 --> 00:26:49,060
Lu Gongfu was not only a famous scholar.

575
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:50,340
but also a kind man.

576
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:51,690
If I couldn't

577
00:26:51,890 --> 00:26:53,480
fill my stomach in the city,

578
00:26:54,030 --> 00:26:55,680
I would go to his house and knock on the back window.

579
00:26:56,140 --> 00:26:57,310
He would give me some food.

580
00:26:57,820 --> 00:27:00,020
Sometimes he even brought back

581
00:27:00,050 --> 00:27:01,360
fish and meat from the feast

582
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:03,270
and gave me from the back window.

583
00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:28,980
When did this happen?

584
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:31,060
At midnight.

585
00:27:31,770 --> 00:27:32,630
At midnight?

586
00:27:33,950 --> 00:27:35,240
Did you make it up

587
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:35,980
just to get a reward?

588
00:27:36,050 --> 00:27:36,820
-I… -Reward him.

589
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:40,840
Do you trust that beggar so much?

590
00:27:41,470 --> 00:27:42,510
He's the first one.

591
00:27:42,790 --> 00:27:44,710
If we don't reward him, will anyone

592
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:46,210
provide us with clues in the future?

593
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:46,860
But this beggar

594
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:48,120
doesn't seem to be lying.

595
00:27:48,290 --> 00:27:49,880
He is lowly. It's normal

596
00:27:50,130 --> 00:27:50,760
that he dared not report to the official.

597
00:27:51,250 --> 00:27:51,920
So?

598
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:53,900
We should investigate

599
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:55,670
the monks related to the Nanzhou Four Scholars,

600
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:56,570
especially

601
00:27:56,900 --> 00:27:58,450
those who had a relationship with Lu Gongfu.

602
00:28:00,670 --> 00:28:02,430
You must pay attention to the details.

603
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:03,150
The details

604
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:05,620
are the key to the investigation.

605
00:28:22,410 --> 00:28:23,570
What are you doing?

606
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:25,380
The chicken porridge has been heated three times.

607
00:28:25,490 --> 00:28:26,860
Are we having the deal or not?

608
00:28:28,970 --> 00:28:30,260
Let's eat.

609
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:32,830
I just heard that it's chicken porridge.

610
00:28:33,550 --> 00:28:34,750
It's Fed's favorite.

611
00:28:34,970 --> 00:28:36,210
All right, time to eat.

612
00:28:36,490 --> 00:28:37,810
I've been looking at this painting all morning.

613
00:28:37,910 --> 00:28:38,470
It's time to return it.

614
00:28:38,510 --> 00:28:39,040
Wait.

615
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:43,020
The painting of the Stone Bridge

616
00:28:43,310 --> 00:28:45,200
is indeed Zhang Xuan's masterpiece.

617
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:46,760
I didn't come to Nanzhou in vain

618
00:28:47,230 --> 00:28:48,910
since I could appreciate it today.

619
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:50,890
But...

620
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:54,350
Ouyang Quan lied to Lu Li.

621
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:56,350
He lied to him?

622
00:28:57,850 --> 00:28:58,650
This place

623
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,190
is not soaked in water.

624
00:29:02,170 --> 00:29:03,820
These rocks and bamboos

625
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,430
are used to cover up the original landscape.

626
00:29:05,970 --> 00:29:06,570
Maybe...

627
00:29:07,050 --> 00:29:08,220
It's more likely to be a person.

628
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:10,670
A person?

629
00:29:13,150 --> 00:29:15,660
Is it drawn by Zhang Xuan?

630
00:29:19,490 --> 00:29:20,270
I don't think so.

631
00:29:20,970 --> 00:29:22,080
From the ink marks,

632
00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:23,870
it should be added later.

633
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:26,140
I think

634
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:28,110
it's like a running person.

635
00:29:30,130 --> 00:29:31,920
These are rocks and bamboos.

636
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:33,550
How can you tell it's a person?

637
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:34,860
Look at this place.

638
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:36,660
the person who modified the painting must understand it.

639
00:29:37,190 --> 00:29:39,150
Only by adding a character here

640
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:40,110
will not destroy

641
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:41,340
the spirit of the whole painting.

642
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:45,320
It's just your imagination.

643
00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:46,440
Do you have any evidence?

644
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:47,560
No.

645
00:29:48,510 --> 00:29:49,070
But I can

646
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:50,340
draw what I imagined.

647
00:30:16,910 --> 00:30:17,570
Isn't that

648
00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:19,350
Ouyang Quan?

649
00:30:20,230 --> 00:30:21,310
You've only met him once,

650
00:30:21,890 --> 00:30:22,300
and you are able to...

651
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,420
This painting was kept

652
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:25,180
by Ouyang Quan.

653
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:26,870
The person who modified the painting

654
00:30:27,810 --> 00:30:28,880
must be himself.

655
00:30:31,130 --> 00:30:33,580
If what Xijun said is true,

656
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:35,910
there was originally a person here.

657
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:37,920
It must be Ouyang Quan.

658
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:40,900
He wanted to use this method

659
00:30:41,350 --> 00:30:42,410
to fulfill his wish

660
00:30:42,430 --> 00:30:44,360
to become the fifth scholar.

661
00:30:45,170 --> 00:30:47,000
If this painting is passed down for a thousand years,

662
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:49,710
who will know

663
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:52,430
whether there are four scholars or five scholars?

664
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:54,070
Ouyang Quan used this clumsy way

665
00:30:54,090 --> 00:30:55,950
to get immortality.

666
00:30:56,870 --> 00:30:59,020
How pathetic!

667
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:00,490
Ouyang Quan,

668
00:31:01,130 --> 00:31:02,450
just like Lin Bao,

669
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:07,400
turned his love to the Nanzhou Four Scholars to resentment.

670
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,180
It became hatred at last.

671
00:31:10,030 --> 00:31:10,600
No.

672
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:12,340
On the day Lu Gongfu died,

673
00:31:12,810 --> 00:31:14,590
he was at home. I saw his testimony.

674
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:16,430
I saw his testimony, too.

675
00:31:16,590 --> 00:31:18,550
But the witnesses were his family.

676
00:31:19,150 --> 00:31:21,950
They just said they were having a feast in the backyard

677
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:23,370
and stayed up all night.

678
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:26,000
But who did they invite?

679
00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:28,560
And where are the guests' testimonies?

680
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:33,280
[Ouyang's Residence]

681
00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:38,660
You Honor.

682
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:39,500
Miss Pei.

683
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:41,850
The Stone Bridge Painting

684
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:43,510
hasn't been in my hands for a long time.

685
00:31:44,170 --> 00:31:45,640
Why are you here again?

686
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:47,190
But you didn't sell it

687
00:31:47,210 --> 00:31:48,660
to a Persian merchant.

688
00:31:48,690 --> 00:31:50,380
You sold it to Lu Li.

689
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:53,050
Lu Li committed a theft.

690
00:31:53,110 --> 00:31:53,520
Therefore,

691
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:56,090
this painting is temporarily kept in the Nanzhou Government.

692
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,280
I brought it out.

693
00:31:57,420 --> 00:31:59,550
Do you want to appreciate

694
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:03,260
this painting again?

695
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:04,620
I had appreciated it

696
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:05,400
for 15 years.

697
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:07,900
We used to be together day and night.

698
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:11,090
But now I've given it up

699
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:12,590
and I will never look at it again.

700
00:32:12,890 --> 00:32:13,450
See the guest out.

701
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:14,610
Stop!

702
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:18,490
You have to look at it.

703
00:32:19,870 --> 00:32:21,550
What do you mean?

704
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:22,450
Ouyang Quan.

705
00:32:23,170 --> 00:32:24,200
Take a look at it.

706
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:25,820
Look at this painting.

707
00:32:26,210 --> 00:32:28,140
Is it different from the one

708
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:29,550
you sold to Lu Li?

709
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:31,590
Unfold the painting.

710
00:32:38,660 --> 00:32:39,500
Come on.

711
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:41,340
Look at the lower right corner.

712
00:33:00,830 --> 00:33:02,350
Who drew this?

713
00:33:02,740 --> 00:33:05,460
It is much better than mine.

714
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:06,390
Look.

715
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:07,140
Look.

716
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:08,290
Look at

717
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:09,160
me in this painting.

718
00:33:09,450 --> 00:33:10,820
Look at the figure and the demeanour.

719
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:12,190
This is

720
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:14,640
a celebrated scholar.

721
00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:16,380
This painting can be renamed as

722
00:33:16,740 --> 00:33:18,490
the Nanzhou Five Scholars!

723
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:22,580
Who painted this?

724
00:33:23,890 --> 00:33:25,290
My sworn sister, Xijun.

725
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:27,900
If I'm not mistaken,

726
00:33:28,250 --> 00:33:30,020
this is the original intention of your modification, right?

727
00:33:31,310 --> 00:33:32,330
Yes.

728
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:33,570
But the painting I modified

729
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:35,160
is intolerable to the eye.

730
00:33:35,830 --> 00:33:36,550
Compared to the four celebrated scholars

731
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:37,790
in this painting,

732
00:33:38,250 --> 00:33:39,450
I'm so vulgar.

733
00:33:41,730 --> 00:33:42,550
Miss Xijun,

734
00:33:43,420 --> 00:33:45,060
could you please

735
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:48,280
draw me on this painting?

736
00:33:48,690 --> 00:33:50,370
I'm willing to pay you a lot.

737
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:51,580
By the way,

738
00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:53,380
the Stone Bridge Painting

739
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:54,490
is no longer mine now.

740
00:33:55,210 --> 00:33:56,180
I want to redeem it.

741
00:33:56,750 --> 00:33:57,390
I will pay

742
00:33:57,700 --> 00:33:58,880
one hundred and fifty thousand copper coins.

743
00:33:59,750 --> 00:34:00,350
Commandar Su,

744
00:34:00,970 --> 00:34:03,100
can you help me out?

745
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:05,610
Ouyang Quan,

746
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:07,820
you want to join the Nanzhou Four Scholars.

747
00:34:08,199 --> 00:34:09,440
And you are so persistent?

748
00:34:09,830 --> 00:34:10,699
Yes.

749
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:12,440
This is my biggest wish

750
00:34:12,870 --> 00:34:14,940
in my life.

751
00:34:15,380 --> 00:34:15,750
So,

752
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:17,750
after you were rejected

753
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:19,300
and kicked out by Lu Gongfu,

754
00:34:20,219 --> 00:34:22,540
you thought of killing him out of despair.

755
00:34:23,110 --> 00:34:24,610
You pretended to entertain guests in the backyard,

756
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:26,940
but no one was allowed to enter.

757
00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:29,830
You climbed over the wall at midnight

758
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:31,540
and sneaked out

759
00:34:31,889 --> 00:34:33,090
to the suburbs through the low city wall

760
00:34:33,420 --> 00:34:35,889
and killed Lu Gongfu.

761
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:36,670
You...

762
00:34:38,739 --> 00:34:39,750
Minister Lu.

763
00:34:39,969 --> 00:34:42,150
I did think about what you said.

764
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:44,739
I even did it in my dreams.

765
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:45,639
But,

766
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:47,219
my affection for them

767
00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:49,230
made me reluctant to do that.

768
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:51,540
How about this?

769
00:34:53,340 --> 00:34:55,830
As long as Miss Xijun promises

770
00:34:56,199 --> 00:34:57,420
to add me

771
00:34:57,740 --> 00:34:59,980
on this painting,

772
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:01,590
I will plead guilty.

773
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:03,710
I'm willing to be executed immediately.

774
00:35:04,410 --> 00:35:07,270
Please let me hold this painting

775
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:11,480
before execution.

776
00:35:16,250 --> 00:35:17,730
At the night Lu Gongfu died,

777
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:19,410
did the four of you

778
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:21,130
drink and have fun here

779
00:35:21,170 --> 00:35:22,050
with Ouyang Quan?

780
00:35:22,780 --> 00:35:24,460
Mr Ouyang paid me to come,

781
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:25,760
so I had to come.

782
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:26,670
Am I right?

783
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:29,630
He even asked me to make tea and taste tea.

784
00:35:29,690 --> 00:35:31,000
How could I do that?

785
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:32,200
I've never seen

786
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:33,400
the authentic work of Yan Yuanfu.

787
00:35:33,530 --> 00:35:34,330
I don't even know

788
00:35:34,370 --> 00:35:35,760
how to write.

789
00:35:36,230 --> 00:35:37,860
I'm just a harp player.

790
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:39,340
He insisted that I should play Guqin.

791
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:41,180
Don't you think he made things difficult for me?

792
00:35:52,890 --> 00:35:53,990
The four of them have confessed.

793
00:35:55,460 --> 00:35:56,740
Ouyang Quan gave them money

794
00:35:57,050 --> 00:35:59,030
and let them dress up as the Nanzhou Four Scholars.

795
00:35:59,810 --> 00:36:00,670
He asked them to travel in the bamboo grove with him

796
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:03,700
in this garden.

797
00:36:04,690 --> 00:36:05,650
This is not the first time.

798
00:36:06,070 --> 00:36:07,300
On the third day of March every year,

799
00:36:07,490 --> 00:36:08,600
the Orchid Pavilion Gathering Day,

800
00:36:09,330 --> 00:36:10,130
Ouyang Quan

801
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:11,160
would invite them here

802
00:36:11,370 --> 00:36:13,200
to drink and have fun all night long.

803
00:36:14,170 --> 00:36:16,470
Although it's not the third day of March this time,

804
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:18,630
I think it's because two of the Four Scholars died.

805
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:20,950
That's the reason why

806
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:23,140
he held

807
00:36:23,170 --> 00:36:24,250
the last feast.

808
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:25,430
It is also an end

809
00:36:25,810 --> 00:36:27,080
to his own wish

810
00:36:27,110 --> 00:36:27,890
to pursue celebrated scholars.

811
00:36:29,730 --> 00:36:31,140
It seems that Ouyang Quan

812
00:36:31,170 --> 00:36:32,610
can be cleared of suspicion.

813
00:36:32,650 --> 00:36:33,840
I don't think

814
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:35,160
he has completely undone this knot in his heart.

815
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:36,890
A businessman

816
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:38,980
is so arty-crafty.

817
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:41,000
He deserves sympathy.

818
00:36:41,060 --> 00:36:41,970
I think he's ridiculous.

819
00:36:42,930 --> 00:36:44,030
I won't waste my time here.

820
00:36:44,340 --> 00:36:45,970
The monks who have contacted the four scholars

821
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:46,560
have all been found.

822
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:48,360
The two of them are suspected.

823
00:36:48,570 --> 00:36:49,570
I have to interrogate them myself.

824
00:36:50,450 --> 00:36:51,420
Go and ask

825
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:52,570
Zhong Boqi and Leng Ji again.

826
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:55,060
Lu Gongfu was always arrogant.

827
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:57,240
Did he offend the monks before?

828
00:37:05,850 --> 00:37:07,590
Judging from their personalities,

829
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:10,380
Lu Lingfeng and his sworn sister

830
00:37:11,090 --> 00:37:12,850
are really different.

831
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:14,820
So,

832
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:16,180
to make Lu Lingfeng

833
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:17,370
careful in judging a case

834
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:19,160
like you,

835
00:37:19,510 --> 00:37:21,350
I'm his best helper.

836
00:37:23,170 --> 00:37:26,340
[Zhong's Residence]

837
00:37:26,390 --> 00:37:27,530
Combs for sale!

838
00:37:28,390 --> 00:37:29,580
Combs for sale!

839
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:32,600
Gentleman,

840
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:33,750
buy a comb.

841
00:37:34,220 --> 00:37:35,130
Go sell it elsewhere.

842
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:36,350
I made this myself.

843
00:37:36,380 --> 00:37:37,170
It's a peach wood comb.

844
00:37:37,450 --> 00:37:38,510
It's used to repel ghosts and demons.

845
00:37:40,150 --> 00:37:41,110
No matter how good it is, I don't want it.

846
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:41,920
Go away.

847
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:42,760
Otherwise,

848
00:37:43,170 --> 00:37:44,690
I'll get flogged. Go away!

849
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:46,500
Buy one.

850
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:48,130
Go! Go away!

851
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:50,980
Is this Zhong's Residence?

852
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:54,980
You are...

853
00:37:55,170 --> 00:37:57,230
Su Wuming, the new Military Commander of Nanzhou.

854
00:37:57,260 --> 00:37:58,840
I want to visit Mr Zhong.

855
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:01,770
Your Honor.

856
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:03,690
But

857
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:05,280
my master

858
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:07,250
is making tea with Mr Leng.

859
00:38:07,730 --> 00:38:08,520
I'm afraid...

860
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:09,710
What are you afraid of?

861
00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:11,620
He will not even meet the Prefectural Governor

862
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:13,320
when making tea.

863
00:38:14,740 --> 00:38:16,060
Then I'll learn how to make tea

864
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:17,050
from your master.

865
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:18,050
What do you think?

866
00:38:18,620 --> 00:38:19,230
Well,

867
00:38:19,860 --> 00:38:21,020
let me inform them.

868
00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:21,780
There's no need.

869
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:23,690
Mr Zhong is a celebrated scholar.

870
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:25,390
He must be open-minded and unrestrained.

871
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:27,530
So he won't be angry

872
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:29,650
if I enter his teahouse directly.

873
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:14,120
In Chang'an,

874
00:39:14,330 --> 00:39:16,490
all I knew is that tea can be drunk.

875
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:18,880
Later I heard that some celebrated scholars in Nanzhou

876
00:39:18,950 --> 00:39:20,680
tasted tea as their ceremony.

877
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:22,920
Today, I finally see

878
00:39:23,050 --> 00:39:25,590
such a wonderful way to make tea.

879
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:27,510
Mr Boqi.

880
00:39:27,620 --> 00:39:30,150
You're indeed a great tea master.

881
00:39:31,650 --> 00:39:34,380
My brother is the leader of the Nanzhou Four Scholars.

882
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,320
The ceremony of drinking tea

883
00:39:37,510 --> 00:39:39,190
is the ceremony of Boqi.

884
00:39:39,870 --> 00:39:41,370
I came here today

885
00:39:41,890 --> 00:39:43,820
to tell you

886
00:39:44,180 --> 00:39:45,670
that the one who killed Lu Gongfu

887
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:47,300
was not Lin Bao.

888
00:39:51,660 --> 00:39:52,430
Who is the murder then?

889
00:39:54,250 --> 00:39:55,330
I don't know yet.

890
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:56,630
I only know

891
00:39:57,020 --> 00:39:59,570
that before Lin Bao stabbed the dagger,

892
00:39:59,820 --> 00:40:01,280
Lu Gongfu had been dead.

893
00:40:02,790 --> 00:40:04,350
Gongfu suffered.

894
00:40:04,750 --> 00:40:05,590
If I can catch the murderer,

895
00:40:06,530 --> 00:40:08,090
I will cut him into pieces.

896
00:40:08,420 --> 00:40:09,300
Gentlemen,

897
00:40:09,860 --> 00:40:10,450
do not grieve too much.

898
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:12,970
When will Commander catch the murderer?

899
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:14,580
We don't know yet.

900
00:40:14,990 --> 00:40:16,070
I'm here

901
00:40:16,230 --> 00:40:17,690
to ask you

902
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:18,720
about

903
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:21,820
whether Lu Gongfu had any enemies before he died,

904
00:40:21,980 --> 00:40:23,500
especially the monks?

905
00:40:24,220 --> 00:40:25,530
Gongfu always lived alone.

906
00:40:25,550 --> 00:40:26,510
He was isolated.

907
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:28,490
He might hold a grudge against someone.

908
00:40:28,890 --> 00:40:29,550
Enemies?

909
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:31,390
I don't think so.

910
00:40:31,930 --> 00:40:34,160
He wouldn't have enemies of monks.

911
00:40:34,690 --> 00:40:35,540
Gongfu was merciful.

912
00:40:36,140 --> 00:40:37,920
He even had a few monk friends.

913
00:40:42,010 --> 00:40:42,450
Brother.

914
00:40:45,690 --> 00:40:47,280
Mr. Zhong, you are sick.

915
00:40:47,740 --> 00:40:49,160
Have you seen a doctor?

916
00:40:50,450 --> 00:40:51,030
An old illness.

917
00:40:51,340 --> 00:40:51,930
It doesn't matter.

918
00:40:52,780 --> 00:40:55,030
A friend of mine knows medicine well.

919
00:40:55,410 --> 00:40:56,630
He came with me from Chang'an.

920
00:40:56,830 --> 00:40:58,420
Shall I ask him to check on you?

921
00:40:58,960 --> 00:40:59,810
Thank you, Commander.

922
00:41:00,370 --> 00:41:01,140
There is no need.

923
00:41:02,180 --> 00:41:03,260
Since Commander is here,

924
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:05,340
please sit down and have a cup of tea.

925
00:41:08,860 --> 00:41:09,900
The two monks

926
00:41:10,490 --> 00:41:11,500
are cleared of suspicion.

927
00:41:13,580 --> 00:41:14,330
In Nanzhou,

928
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:15,720
I've visited

929
00:41:15,780 --> 00:41:16,810
all the temples.

930
00:41:17,630 --> 00:41:19,030
But I haven't found any clues.

931
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:20,480
Could it be

932
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:23,060
a wandering monk passing by Nanzhou

933
00:41:23,090 --> 00:41:24,050
who killed him?

934
00:41:24,730 --> 00:41:26,200
It's possible,

935
00:41:27,110 --> 00:41:29,130
but it lacks motive.

936
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:31,500
The most valuable thing Lu Gongfu had

937
00:41:31,530 --> 00:41:32,520
was the Guqin.

938
00:41:33,070 --> 00:41:34,840
The other treasures were not lost.

939
00:41:36,550 --> 00:41:38,060
So, this case...

940
00:41:38,130 --> 00:41:38,570
Yes.

941
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:41,770
This case is temporarily in a deadlock.

942
00:41:43,410 --> 00:41:46,030
It may take a few more days

943
00:41:46,430 --> 00:41:48,030
to find the murderer.

944
00:41:48,580 --> 00:41:50,320
Commander Su, what you said means nothing.

945
00:41:50,580 --> 00:41:51,490
But it's normal.

946
00:41:51,820 --> 00:41:53,270
Although you are Detective Di's disciple,

947
00:41:53,620 --> 00:41:54,930
you are not Detective Di after all.

948
00:41:55,340 --> 00:41:56,930
I've been investigating this case.

949
00:41:57,190 --> 00:41:58,310
What does it have to do with Commander Su？

950
00:41:59,210 --> 00:41:59,940
You...

951
00:42:01,660 --> 00:42:02,750
Some news in Chang'an

952
00:42:02,780 --> 00:42:04,020
can still reach Nanzhou.

953
00:42:05,020 --> 00:42:05,750
Prefectural Governor.

954
00:42:06,510 --> 00:42:08,120
In my opinion,

955
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:09,720
Lu doesn't need to be the Acting Minister of Justice.

956
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:11,610
He was the General of the Imperial Guards once.

957
00:42:11,950 --> 00:42:13,300
He doesn't care about such an official.

958
00:42:13,860 --> 00:42:15,340
No need for us to ask for trouble.

959
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:16,620
Am I right?

960
00:42:17,430 --> 00:42:18,110
Yes.

961
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:21,690
With Lu Lingfeng's talent,

962
00:42:22,980 --> 00:42:24,790
it doesn't make sense

963
00:42:25,330 --> 00:42:26,890
to be the Acting Minister of Justice.

964
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:28,850
On the way here,

965
00:42:29,260 --> 00:42:31,880
he asked me to resign for him.

966
00:42:33,950 --> 00:42:35,230
Thank you, Governor Xiong.

967
00:42:35,770 --> 00:42:36,970
Please take back

968
00:42:37,620 --> 00:42:38,360
the position of the Acting Minister of Justice.

969
00:42:42,130 --> 00:42:43,080
Alright.

970
00:42:43,420 --> 00:42:46,630
So that you and Lu

971
00:42:46,660 --> 00:42:49,940
can have a more leisurely life in Nanzhou.

972
00:42:53,210 --> 00:42:54,110
By the way,

973
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:56,220
Nanzhou

974
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:58,320
has another big thing recently.

975
00:42:58,770 --> 00:43:00,030
The two sons

976
00:43:00,060 --> 00:43:01,720
of Mr Xie, our county sage,

977
00:43:01,900 --> 00:43:03,540
have both passed the highest imperial examinations.

978
00:43:04,090 --> 00:43:05,780
Tonight, they'll hold a banquet

979
00:43:05,970 --> 00:43:07,120
to entertain guests and friends at Lake Pavilion tonight.

980
00:43:07,210 --> 00:43:09,120
Please attend the banquet.

981
00:43:09,450 --> 00:43:10,060
Also,

982
00:43:10,140 --> 00:43:12,100
you can take Assistant Minister Pei's daughter

983
00:43:12,350 --> 00:43:14,650
to have fun there together.

984
00:43:15,410 --> 00:43:17,100
We'll listen to the Prefectural Governor.
