4
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:01,180
Where is governor's daughter,

5
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:02,600
Yingtao?

6
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:04,340
Her father was buried,

7
00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:05,250
but she is not here.

8
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:06,580
That's ridiculous.

9
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:13,020
Father!

10
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:15,460
Father.

11
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:22,940
You died miserably.

12
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:26,180
The government is incompetent.

13
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:28,540
The officials dare not to arrest the murderer.

14
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:31,300
But I

15
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,760
will avenge

16
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:37,760
your death.

17
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:39,310
Miss Yingtao.

18
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,900
The dead can't be revived.

19
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:43,620
My condolences.

20
00:02:58,570 --> 00:02:59,540
Bury the prefectural governor first.

21
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:01,000
We'll discuss the rest later.

22
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:04,110
Since Governor Li's daughter is here,

23
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:06,510
it's time to bury the coffin.

24
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:07,710
No.

25
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:09,340
What? No burial?

26
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,230
Why?

27
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:11,490
Why can't he be buried?

28
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:12,430
Su Wuming.

29
00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:14,640
You want to stop my father from being buried?

30
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:17,329
The headless corpse in the coffin

31
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:19,530
is not Governor Li.

32
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:24,520
Nonsense!

33
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:25,660
Commander,

34
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:27,780
don't say like that.

35
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:29,060
Yes, Brother Su.

36
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:31,740
It's good to be careful with your words and actions.

37
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:34,000
Administrator Gu, please give the order.

38
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:35,440
Open the coffin.

39
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,440
Commander, are you crazy?

40
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:38,470
This matter concerns the reputation of Ninghu.

41
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:39,700
I'm right here.

42
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:41,860
Who dares to open the coffin?

43
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:44,150
If anything goes wrong after opening the coffin,

44
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:47,670
Su Wuming is willing to go to prison.

45
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:50,050
Everyone can testify.

46
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:53,690
Open the coffin!

47
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:00,770
How can you open the coffin?

48
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:01,760
That's ridiculous.

49
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:23,130
Yingtao.

50
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,540
You just arrived at Ninghu

51
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:26,860
and met Governor Li.

52
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:29,940
Let me ask you.

53
00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:31,780
Can you be 100 percent sure

54
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:34,470
to tell if this is your father?

55
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:38,300
This...

56
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:45,470
There are rough skin and calluses

57
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:48,159
between this man's left thumb and index finger.

58
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:50,290
I don't think

59
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:53,810
they are caused by holding a brush pen for years.

60
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:55,659
It should be caused

61
00:04:55,690 --> 00:04:57,890
by holding a knife or something alike.

62
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:02,210
As far as I know,

63
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:04,700
Governor Li is good at writing poems and articles.

64
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:06,240
His calligraphy is even better.

65
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:09,070
He's a pure scholar.

66
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:11,700
How did such a person

67
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:13,200
have a hand like this?

68
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:18,030
The prefectural governor became an official through the imperial examination

69
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:19,640
almost in his fifties.

70
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:22,060
He must have taken the exam many times.

71
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,840
During that period, he farmed with hoes.

72
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,220
What's wrong with that?

73
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,950
What you say makes sense, Minister He.

74
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:32,050
But I asked Lu Yong.

75
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:35,020
Xiao Qi, the assassin he hired,

76
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:36,890
is a left-handed swordsman,

77
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:40,070
and has a red birthmark

78
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:42,870
on his left hand.

79
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,260
My father doesn't have that.

80
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,270
Unbelievable.

81
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:52,300
Did I investigate in the wrong direction

82
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:53,450
from the beginning?

83
00:05:55,950 --> 00:05:57,390
Commander Su means

84
00:05:57,730 --> 00:06:00,700
Governor Li is not dead?

85
00:06:02,010 --> 00:06:03,360
I can only say

86
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:05,580
this headless corpse

87
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:07,790
is Xiao Qi, the assassin.

88
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:10,560
What happened on earth?

89
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:12,350
On the day of the incident,

90
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:14,990
Xiao Qi sneaked into the villa.

91
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:16,680
We don't know

92
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:18,190
whether he killed Governor Li or not.

93
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:20,030
But he encountered an accident.

94
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:22,100
His head and the right arm

95
00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:23,310
were bitten away by a giant alligator.

96
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,160
It's so scary.

97
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:28,590
What's going on?

98
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:31,070
We may ask Li Si to identify the body.

99
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:32,230
Li Si.

100
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:40,350
Administrator Gu.

101
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:42,710
This case is very strange.

102
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:44,130
Please allow me

103
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,930
to assist Minister He in further investigation.

104
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:53,150
Minister Zeng, what's your opinion?

105
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:56,780
Since Commander Su is so intelligent,

106
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:59,050
you should grant him the permission

107
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:00,550
to investigate.

108
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:02,880
But the Double Third Festival

109
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:04,260
will come in ten days.

110
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:06,600
Why don't we solve the case after the festival?

111
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:08,940
Our attention should be given

112
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:11,350
to the God Sighting Ceremony.

113
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:13,980
Of course, this is just

114
00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:16,910
my own opinion before I retire as an official.

115
00:07:17,690 --> 00:07:19,430
What Minister Zeng said is reasonable.

116
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:21,680
The Double Third Festival is indeed

117
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,040
a big day for Ninghu.

118
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:26,160
But it remains unknown whether Governor Li is alive or not.

119
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:27,340
He can't...

120
00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:30,240
It's my first to come to Ninghu.

121
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:32,500
I can't help

122
00:07:32,690 --> 00:07:34,370
in preparing for the God Sighting Ceremony.

123
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:37,710
Why don't we set the Double Third Festival as the deadline?

124
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,460
I will clarify the facts of the case before the festival.

125
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,500
Won't that be in ten days?

126
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:42,870
Commander Su.

127
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,550
If you can't find out the truth before that,

128
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:45,850
you will have no choice

129
00:07:46,159 --> 00:07:47,130
but to be put into prison.

130
00:07:48,090 --> 00:07:49,130
Why should he be imprisoned?

131
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:51,250
It is right for Commander Su to open the coffin.

132
00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:53,070
You have no say in that.

133
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,010
This case concerns a lot.

134
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:56,100
If we can't find out the truth,

135
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:57,340
someone has to take the responsibility.

136
00:07:57,970 --> 00:07:58,480
Besides,

137
00:07:59,090 --> 00:08:00,790
Commander Su himself said

138
00:08:00,810 --> 00:08:01,610
he would find out the truth in ten days.

139
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:03,000
I didn't push him.

140
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:06,160
Then I'll do as you say.

141
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:07,460
Okay.

142
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:09,420
And He Xi.

143
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:11,300
If you can't solve this case,

144
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,400
you won't be able to get away with it.

145
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:16,900
How could this happen?

146
00:08:17,410 --> 00:08:18,100
Let's go.

147
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:18,960
It's so scary.

148
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:21,460
All right.

149
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:22,060
Let's go.

150
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:23,070
Commander Su.

151
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:25,260
How dare you say yes to that?

152
00:08:26,470 --> 00:08:27,320
There are legends

153
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:30,300
in every place.

154
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,030
Ninghu is located in the lake area.

155
00:08:33,059 --> 00:08:35,380
It's called the Homeland of Alligators, or Tuo God.

156
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,270
Because of these legends,

157
00:08:37,309 --> 00:08:38,900
it's not uncommon for people to worship Tuo God.

158
00:08:38,929 --> 00:08:40,010
But what's uncommon is

159
00:08:40,179 --> 00:08:42,429
that some people, in the name of Tuo God,

160
00:08:42,770 --> 00:08:44,410
rob money and property,

161
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,960
and harm the people.

162
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:47,280
What's worse,

163
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:49,540
many officials

164
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:51,830
collude with these criminals.

165
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:53,730
Is this place

166
00:08:55,090 --> 00:08:57,840
still the Ninghu of Tang?

167
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:21,280
Justice should be held for all.

168
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,550
How dare you, Shen Chong!

169
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:42,220
As the Chief,

170
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:44,110
you even don't know

171
00:11:44,130 --> 00:11:45,280
whether Li Yu is dead or not.

172
00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:48,230
How incompetent and useless you are!

173
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:49,810
Please forgive me, Tuo God.

174
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:51,730
I will send someone to investigate it.

175
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:52,910
Investigate?

176
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:55,860
Su Wuming has investigated it for you.

177
00:11:58,740 --> 00:11:59,620
Chief Shen.

178
00:12:00,570 --> 00:12:02,160
It's reasonable for Tuo God to be angry.

179
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:04,580
If Li Yu is still alive,

180
00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:06,380
even if he doesn't have

181
00:12:06,410 --> 00:12:07,880
the so-called Records of Worshippers of Tuo God,

182
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:11,300
he's a living testimony.

183
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:13,140
Yes.

184
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:15,740
I will dispatch someone to find Li Yu.

185
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:16,740
Tuo God.

186
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:17,630
Isn't that Su Wuming

187
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:18,710
so despicable?

188
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:20,070
Despicable?

189
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:22,330
We need to thank him.

190
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:24,320
If it's not because of him,

191
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:26,500
we wouldn't have known that the dead is not Li Yu.

192
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:29,930
To thank Commander Su,

193
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:33,310
I will invite him

194
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:34,810
to practice immortality within my stomach.

195
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:45,370
Yingtao.

196
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,400
I hope you can answer me honestly.

197
00:12:47,950 --> 00:12:49,240
Where were you before you got to Ninghu?

198
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:50,650
Does this have anything to do with this case?

199
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:53,950
Let me do that.

200
00:12:58,570 --> 00:12:59,210
Li Yingtao.

201
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:00,460
What are you calling me?

202
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:02,630
I mean

203
00:13:03,610 --> 00:13:04,290
I'm used to being called

204
00:13:04,330 --> 00:13:05,320
Yingtao.

205
00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:07,780
Yingtao.

206
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:10,450
You're good at flying darts.

207
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:11,980
Last time,

208
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:13,300
you hit the wicked with only one dart.

209
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:15,540
This is not a dart.

210
00:13:16,130 --> 00:13:16,900
It's a sleeve arrow.

211
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:19,180
Isn't it more powerful?

212
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:21,940
That's why I'm suddenly curious.

213
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:26,400
Your father, Governor Li, is good at poetry.

214
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:29,030
Why did he ask his daughter to practice martial arts?

215
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:39,320
If you don't want to answer,

216
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:41,140
let's start

217
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:43,020
from the Records of Worshippers of Tuo God.

218
00:13:46,710 --> 00:13:47,930
My mother died of illness when I was young.

219
00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:50,590
My father swore to pass the imperial exam.

220
00:13:50,990 --> 00:13:52,290
So when I was eight,

221
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:53,580
he asked a Buddhist nun

222
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:54,920
to bring me up,

223
00:13:55,770 --> 00:13:56,920
so that he could

224
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,150
go to Chang'an for the exam.

225
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,830
After that, the Buddhist nun

226
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:02,410
became my master

227
00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:04,500
and taught me martial arts.

228
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:08,050
That's it.

229
00:14:09,090 --> 00:14:10,240
Three months ago,

230
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:12,350
Li Si, my father's servant,

231
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:14,400
found me.

232
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:16,840
I was told that my father became a prefectural governor,

233
00:14:17,710 --> 00:14:18,920
and he asked me to meet him at Ninghu.

234
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:21,390
But at that time,

235
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:23,600
my master was seriously ill,

236
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:25,370
so I couldn't come here immediately.

237
00:14:28,170 --> 00:14:29,160
More than half a month ago,

238
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:31,510
she passed away.

239
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:33,720
After I arranged her funeral,

240
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:35,460
I came to Ninghu.

241
00:14:36,050 --> 00:14:36,840
Go on.

242
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:40,690
It was the second day after I came here

243
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:42,580
when we met at the Temple of Tuo God.

244
00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:45,730
I've learned from the people

245
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:47,300
that my father is a good official

246
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:48,770
who devotes himself to the people.

247
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:51,780
However,

248
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:55,160
he was controlled by the Worshippers of Tuo God.

249
00:14:56,550 --> 00:14:58,750
Governor Li joined the Worshippers of Tuo God.

250
00:14:58,780 --> 00:14:59,800
Is that true?

251
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:01,220
Yes.

252
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:03,700
Rumor has it that

253
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:06,400
I'm a member of the Worshippers of Tuo God.

254
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:08,130
[Li Yu, Prefectural Governor of Ninghu]

255
00:15:08,210 --> 00:15:09,300
What do you think?

256
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:10,450
I don't believe it.

257
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:12,870
Although I just arrived in Ninghu,

258
00:15:13,630 --> 00:15:14,650
I can see

259
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,160
this so-called divine shrine

260
00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:18,560
is actually an evil one.

261
00:15:19,290 --> 00:15:20,800
What they said is true.

262
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:22,940
You are sensitive.

263
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:25,660
A few years ago,

264
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:27,980
Worshippers of Tuo God did something good for the city.

265
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:29,840
But now it has changed

266
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:33,120
to an evil shrine that sabotages people.

267
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:35,790
Then why do you join them?

268
00:15:36,530 --> 00:15:37,290
Because your father

269
00:15:37,310 --> 00:15:38,540
wants to do something extraordinary

270
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:39,400
for the people of Ninghu.

271
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:41,580
If I didn't join the shrine,

272
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:42,980
I wouldn't be able to write

273
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,090
Records of Worshippers of Tuo God.

274
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:45,450
All the evil deeds they have done,

275
00:15:45,930 --> 00:15:46,700
including how they ripped off money

276
00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:47,890
from civilian traders,

277
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:49,430
are recorded.

278
00:15:50,090 --> 00:15:51,630
And I also write down

279
00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:52,600
the tricks they used

280
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:54,200
when they collected taxes for the government.

281
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:55,650
These are all

282
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:57,490
recorded clearly in it.

283
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,350
No wonder the members of the shrine

284
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:01,180
want to kill your father.

285
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:02,160
My father told me

286
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:04,790
he hid one of the Records

287
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:05,980
in the Temple of Tuo God.

288
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:07,300
He wanted me to bring it

289
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:08,450
to the procurator's office in Chang'an.

290
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:09,840
He said in Ninghu,

291
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:14,730
he had no one to trust.

292
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:22,470
On that rainy night,

293
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:25,580
you went to the Temple of Tuo God outside the city

294
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:26,720
to find

295
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:28,000
the Records, right?

296
00:16:46,090 --> 00:16:46,660
That night,

297
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:48,180
Lu Yong wanted to burn the temple,

298
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:50,050
but was battered by Shen Chong and his subordinates.

299
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:50,980
Later,

300
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:52,630
you pretended to be Tuo God

301
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:53,520
and scared Shen Chong away.

302
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:55,540
I dared not delay.

303
00:16:56,380 --> 00:16:57,340
So I wanted to take the Records

304
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,090
directly to Chang'an.

305
00:17:07,650 --> 00:17:08,260
Who's that?

306
00:17:08,450 --> 00:17:09,480
He's sneaking in the dark.

307
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:10,859
He must be Lu Yong's accomplice.

308
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:11,380
Arrest him!

309
00:17:11,410 --> 00:17:11,920
Yes.

310
00:17:25,530 --> 00:17:27,700
Daughter of Governor Li?

311
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:29,460
You just arrived in Ninghu.

312
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:31,010
Why are you sneaking around?

313
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:32,550
You are planning to do

314
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:33,920
something shameful, aren't you?

315
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:34,930
Take her down.

316
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:52,510
Get her!

317
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:55,250
I didn't think I would be able to escape that day,

318
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:57,380
so I hid the Records

319
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:58,870
in a tree cave.

320
00:18:05,910 --> 00:18:07,390
But the next day when I went back to look for it,

321
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:09,570
nothing was left there.

322
00:18:10,010 --> 00:18:10,650
That night,

323
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,250
if you hadn't gone to the temple,

324
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:13,540
I would have taken the Records

325
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:14,460
to Chang'an.

326
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:16,790
No wonder you didn't trust me

327
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:20,440
to the extent that you used ecstasy incense on me.

328
00:18:21,910 --> 00:18:23,070
I know this very well.

329
00:18:23,490 --> 00:18:24,250
I once interrogated Lu Yong

330
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:25,050
in the Ninghu Prison.

331
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,460
The Records you hid in the tree cave

332
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:32,430
was found by Lu Yong in the escape.

333
00:18:40,430 --> 00:18:41,450
He was so proud of himself or even complacent

334
00:18:40,790 --> 00:18:42,460
[Records of Worshippers of Tuo God]

335
00:18:41,610 --> 00:18:42,670
that he sent it to Gu Wenbin.

336
00:18:42,850 --> 00:18:43,680
He didn't expect that Gu Wenbin

337
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:45,540
gave it to the Shrine.

338
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:48,860
Is Administrator Gu

339
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:50,390
also from the Shrine?

340
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:53,140
He's always sophisticated.

341
00:18:53,450 --> 00:18:54,890
So it's not surprising whether he is or not.

342
00:18:57,450 --> 00:18:58,090
Yingtao,

343
00:18:58,540 --> 00:19:00,060
how many copies are there

344
00:19:00,090 --> 00:19:01,360
of the Records?

345
00:19:02,930 --> 00:19:03,930
My father only told me

346
00:19:04,430 --> 00:19:05,510
there was one in the Temple of Tuo God.

347
00:19:05,990 --> 00:19:06,750
So the top priority

348
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:07,700
is to find Prefectural Governor Li,

349
00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:09,490
be he's alive or dead.

350
00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:15,970
Does Governor Li

351
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:18,740
have any relative in Ninghu?

352
00:19:19,330 --> 00:19:20,530
Before Yingtao came to Ninghu,

353
00:19:20,610 --> 00:19:21,700
Governor Li was alone.

354
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:23,290
There was no prefectural governor's mansion built for him.

355
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:24,790
He just lived in the backyard of the government office.

356
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,050
Yingtao.

357
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:31,380
Does your father

358
00:19:33,850 --> 00:19:35,050
have... have...

359
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:37,230
any confidante?

360
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:39,180
Commander Su, what do you mean?

361
00:19:39,450 --> 00:19:40,620
My father is the Prefectural Governor.

362
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:42,410
He does not indulge in merry-making.

363
00:19:44,030 --> 00:19:46,780
Do you have the habit of wearing makeup?

364
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:48,830
What do you think?

365
00:19:49,310 --> 00:19:50,540
It seems not.

366
00:19:55,290 --> 00:19:56,240
I have

367
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:59,460
a piece of gold foil,

368
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:01,070
which is found

369
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:03,010
in your father's villa.

370
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:11,510
This is the most popular one in Chang'an.

371
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:13,270
It is applied on huadian, the plum makeup.

372
00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:14,480
Why do you have it?

373
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:16,990
Are you sure?

374
00:20:17,430 --> 00:20:18,270
Sure.

375
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:19,230
When I was in Chang'an,

376
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:20,340
I used it quite often.

377
00:20:21,030 --> 00:20:22,820
This is the most popular in Chang'an.

378
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:24,950
But you practice martial arts,

379
00:20:24,970 --> 00:20:26,980
and don't have the habit to wear makeup.

380
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,070
So I suspect

381
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:30,020
before your father died,

382
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:32,720
a lady from Chang'an came to the villa.

383
00:20:33,870 --> 00:20:34,920
That's impossible.

384
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:36,420
Alright.

385
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:40,020
Before we find Governor Li,

386
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:43,130
all are just guesses.

387
00:20:50,170 --> 00:20:50,880
Yingtao.

388
00:20:51,270 --> 00:20:53,300
You may stay here for the time being.

389
00:20:53,790 --> 00:20:55,220
Minister He is reliable.

390
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:57,910
Don't show yourself in public

391
00:20:57,980 --> 00:21:00,340
in case you get yourself into trouble.

392
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:06,330
There is indeed a secret tunnel,

393
00:21:08,330 --> 00:21:09,380
and a female corpse.

394
00:21:09,990 --> 00:21:10,730
Female body?

395
00:21:11,730 --> 00:21:13,090
Is there a huadian on her face?

396
00:21:14,470 --> 00:21:15,140
I think so.

397
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:16,500
What do you mean by that?

398
00:21:16,870 --> 00:21:18,590
You two were in the same coffin.

399
00:21:18,690 --> 00:21:20,270
You were so close to each other.

400
00:21:20,290 --> 00:21:21,730
How could you not see it?

401
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:23,660
The light was really dark back then,

402
00:21:23,830 --> 00:21:24,800
and it was under the mouth of Tuo God.

403
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:25,340
I...

404
00:21:25,930 --> 00:21:27,010
I was in no mood to observe her.

405
00:21:42,350 --> 00:21:44,770
[Bishui Pavilion]

406
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:23,030
How is this possible?

407
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:25,110
Does it come back to life?

408
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:55,780
Turn around.

409
00:23:14,090 --> 00:23:15,250
I, Li Si,

410
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:17,510
raised a giant alligator in the villa.

411
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,840
I let it bite the prefectural governor, Li Yu, to death

412
00:23:20,490 --> 00:23:22,500
just to take possession of the woman from Chang'an.

413
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:23,850
That night,

[Li Si]

416
00:23:26,550 --> 00:23:28,280
was also sent to that Chang'an woman.

417
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,830
But she just didn't obey.

418
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:33,300
So I killed her.

419
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:40,510
Where is Li Yu's body?

420
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:52,060
He seems to mean

421
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:54,960
that he sank the body into the lake.

422
00:23:56,230 --> 00:23:57,010
Then answer me.

423
00:23:57,580 --> 00:23:59,030
What is the background

424
00:23:59,060 --> 00:24:00,160
of that Chang'an woman?

425
00:24:17,210 --> 00:24:18,450
He bit his tongue and committed suicide.

426
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:23,500
That means Li Si has admitted

427
00:24:23,530 --> 00:24:24,540
all the crimes.

428
00:24:26,350 --> 00:24:27,510
He who excuses himself accuses himself.

429
00:24:27,890 --> 00:24:29,000
Li Yu must be alive.

430
00:24:29,890 --> 00:24:31,240
Minister He has sent people

431
00:24:31,270 --> 00:24:32,450
to search the whole city.

432
00:24:33,490 --> 00:24:35,560
But there's no news yet.

433
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:48,600
Do you want to

434
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:51,310
stay in prison forever?

435
00:24:51,570 --> 00:24:52,340
Commander, please spare my life.

436
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:54,130
I have no choice.

437
00:24:54,530 --> 00:24:55,760
If I don't be their eyes and ears,

438
00:24:56,150 --> 00:24:58,460
I'll be thrown into the Swamp of Alligators.

439
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:01,020
Worshippers of Tuo God again?

440
00:25:01,630 --> 00:25:02,270
Remember,

441
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:05,180
nothing in this world

442
00:25:05,310 --> 00:25:06,370
can be a reason

443
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:09,420
to hold the candle to the devil.

444
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:12,380
Let him go.

445
00:25:13,270 --> 00:25:13,670
Let's go.

446
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:22,220
You ask me to identify the body?

447
00:25:25,110 --> 00:25:25,820
Whose body?

448
00:25:26,810 --> 00:25:28,880
It should be the body of a Chang'an woman.

449
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:30,090
That's a joke.

450
00:25:30,690 --> 00:25:31,520
I've already told you

451
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:33,660
I didn't know any woman from Chang'an.

452
00:25:34,530 --> 00:25:35,200
My father

453
00:25:35,370 --> 00:25:36,420
would be less likely to know her.

454
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:38,580
I'm not going.

455
00:25:39,050 --> 00:25:40,930
So I carried the body

456
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:42,170
here.

457
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:56,390
I don't know her.

458
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:57,870

and this woman from Chang'an.

462
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:10,250
And he

463
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:12,130
has bitten his tongue and killed himself.

464
00:26:12,130 --> 00:26:12,760

No need.

Li Si's death

474
00:26:46,990 --> 00:26:49,940
is obviously hiding something.

475
00:26:50,610 --> 00:26:51,670
Can you tell me

what he wants to hide?

to solve this case.

00:28:39,430 --> 00:28:39,950
Fine.

518
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:41,690
After the Double Third Festival,

519
00:28:42,330 --> 00:28:43,360
you will be imprisoned in Ninghu.

520
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:45,330
I'll take Fed, Xijun

521
00:28:45,350 --> 00:28:46,690
and Xue Huan to travel around the world.

522
00:28:47,450 --> 00:28:48,860
We will go wherever there is good wine.

523
00:28:49,570 --> 00:28:50,580
As long as there is wine.

524
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:51,460
Sworn brother.

525
00:28:53,770 --> 00:28:54,840
What are you telling them to do?

526
00:28:55,290 --> 00:28:55,860
Why isn't there anything

527
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:56,790
for Xue Huan and me to do?

528
00:28:58,620 --> 00:28:59,930
Ninghu

529
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:01,490
is very weird.

530
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:02,930
Worshippers of Tuo God are too powerful

531
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:04,360
and their background is unclear.

532
00:29:04,490 --> 00:29:05,930
Don't go out unless you have something to do.

533
00:29:06,470 --> 00:29:06,870
Xue Huan.

534
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,910
Protect Miss Xijun well.

535
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:09,400
Yes.

536
00:29:10,930 --> 00:29:11,930
Tuo God.

537
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:13,770
The outbound water and land routes

538
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:15,460
are both monitored by our men.

539
00:29:16,010 --> 00:29:17,160
As long as he's still alive,

540
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:18,860
he must still be in Ninghu.

541
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:22,180
Are there many places where people can hide

542
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:23,050
in Ninghu?

543
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:25,470
You have so many men,

544
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:27,180
but you still can't find Li Yu.

545
00:29:27,350 --> 00:29:29,030
Chief Shen. You didn't put much effort into it, did you?

546
00:29:30,110 --> 00:29:30,910
You misunderstand me.

547
00:29:31,250 --> 00:29:32,470
I've always done my best

548
00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:33,820
for Tuo God.

549
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,620
We've searched all over Ninghu.

550
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:37,970
Besides,

551
00:29:38,150 --> 00:29:39,190
He Xi and Su Wuming

552
00:29:39,270 --> 00:29:40,210
are also looking for Li Yu.

553
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:42,380
I've planted spies

554
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:43,390
around them.

555
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:44,690
If they find something,

556
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,360
we will get it first.

557
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:48,820
But after so many days,

558
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:49,970
they...

559
00:29:50,050 --> 00:29:51,450
Have you searched Hanshan?

560
00:29:51,950 --> 00:29:52,340
I...

561
00:29:53,550 --> 00:29:54,660
Without Tuo God's permission,

562
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:56,660
how dare I go to Hanshan.

563
00:29:57,210 --> 00:29:59,470
I allow you to search Hanshan.

564
00:30:00,050 --> 00:30:02,930
Li Yu mustn't survive the Double Third Festival.

565
00:30:04,210 --> 00:30:05,420
As you wish.

566
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:11,050
Mr. Zeng?

567
00:30:11,610 --> 00:30:12,680
Minister He.

568
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:15,300
I know you've been working hard recently,

569
00:30:15,770 --> 00:30:17,760
so I come to see you.

570
00:30:18,630 --> 00:30:19,230
Mr. Zeng.

571
00:30:19,590 --> 00:30:20,180
Please come in.

572
00:30:23,230 --> 00:30:23,930
I

573
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:26,230
will resign from office.

574
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:28,970
Do you know that?

575
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:30,510
I've heard that.

576
00:30:30,980 --> 00:30:32,410
Mr. Zeng has been working for the city for many years.

577
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:34,570
I'm really reluctant.

578
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:36,900
I wanted to invite Prefectural Governor Li

579
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:39,060
to attend my banquet for resignation.

580
00:30:40,450 --> 00:30:41,960
But Prefectural Governor Li is dead.

581
00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:43,690
No.

582
00:30:44,610 --> 00:30:46,520
He's not dead. He's lost.

583
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:48,110
We can't find him.

584
00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:49,490
Tell me.

585
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:50,940
We really can't find the prefectural governor

586
00:30:51,540 --> 00:30:53,160
in Ninghu?

587
00:30:53,450 --> 00:30:54,180
Yes.

588
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:55,080
I'm also thinking about it.

589
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:57,780
He hasn't left Ninghu, has he?

590
00:30:59,170 --> 00:31:00,030
He

591
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:01,890
has probably left.

592
00:31:02,410 --> 00:31:03,380
Otherwise, would the prefectural governor

593
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:04,990
go to Hanshan

594
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:06,360
with tramps and beggars?

595
00:31:07,110 --> 00:31:07,780
Hanshan?

596
00:31:09,090 --> 00:31:10,300
Why didn't I think of that?

597
00:31:12,870 --> 00:31:15,000
I remember when Mr. Zeng was the Chief of Hanshan,

598
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:16,740
you caught three murderers

599
00:31:16,770 --> 00:31:17,860
in Hanshan a day.

600
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:19,050
Yes.

601
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:21,230
That place is a mess,

602
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:24,350
and it's an important place under the worshippers' jurisdiction.

603
00:31:25,650 --> 00:31:27,900
Prefectural Governor Li won't go there.

604
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:35,040
Commander Su.

605
00:31:34,730 --> 00:31:36,080
[Commander's Residence]

606
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:37,340
There is no news of the prefectural governor in the city.

607
00:31:37,610 --> 00:31:38,450
But there is still one place

608
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:40,010
for us to try our luck.

609
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:47,330
Commander.

610
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:49,060
Who is he?

611
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:52,020
He is my personal staff.

612
00:31:58,100 --> 00:31:59,920
Where did you just shout in the yard

613
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:02,910
can we try our luck?

614
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:06,080
This...

615
00:32:06,450 --> 00:32:07,120
Hanshan!

616
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:09,940
Hanshan!

617
00:32:13,790 --> 00:32:14,490
Hanshan,

618
00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:18,480
just like the Ghost Market in Chang'an,

619
00:32:18,950 --> 00:32:21,130
is the best hiding place in Ninghu.

620
00:32:21,490 --> 00:32:22,640
Before the Double Third Festival,

621
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,080
there will be Hanshan banquets

622
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:25,410
for three consecutive days.

623
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:27,010
Today is the first day.

624
00:32:27,450 --> 00:32:28,550
Guess what?

625
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:33,900
Usually, officials and civilians in Ninghu

626
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:36,790
have nowhere to buy Tuo God Wine even if they have money.

627
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:38,910
In these three days,

628
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:41,040
they can drink freely in Hanshan.

629
00:32:41,350 --> 00:32:42,340
It's Tuo God's treat.

630
00:32:42,950 --> 00:32:44,150
That's great.

631
00:32:44,510 --> 00:32:46,460
Tuo God may not be bad.

632
00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:47,460
Fed.

633
00:32:48,290 --> 00:32:49,670
Didn't I ask you to find wine?

634
00:32:51,750 --> 00:32:53,190
If Prefectural Governor Li

635
00:32:53,210 --> 00:32:53,990
loves wine as well,

636
00:32:54,330 --> 00:32:55,620
he will certainly go.

637
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:58,370
Minister He. Is Hanshan the place

638
00:32:58,800 --> 00:32:59,630
you just mentioned?

639
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:00,450
Yes.

640
00:33:01,010 --> 00:33:03,180
Minister Lu has been secretly investigating Hanshan

641
00:33:03,890 --> 00:33:05,250
for three consecutive days.

642
00:33:05,570 --> 00:33:06,450
Tell me about the situation.

643
00:33:07,530 --> 00:33:08,840
Hanshan is cold and slient during the day,

644
00:33:09,170 --> 00:33:09,950
and lively at night.

645
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:11,170
This place is a mixture of good and bad

646
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:12,680
and there are thieves.

647
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:15,370
It does look like the Ghost Market in Chang'an.

648
00:33:16,190 --> 00:33:16,950
In Hanshan,

649
00:33:17,350 --> 00:33:19,350
many shops are usually closed,

650
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:21,340
and many houses are even ownerless.

651
00:33:22,030 --> 00:33:23,320
The tramps can live anywhere.

652
00:33:23,540 --> 00:33:24,540
As long as they put a lock on,

653
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:25,910
no one can get in.

654
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:27,460
So it's too hard

655
00:33:28,060 --> 00:33:28,770
to find someone.

656
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:29,640
But

657
00:33:30,190 --> 00:33:31,790
the three days before Double Third Festival from today

658
00:33:31,820 --> 00:33:32,810
are different.

659
00:33:33,450 --> 00:33:34,520
All the houses and shops

660
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:35,560
in Hanshan

661
00:33:35,730 --> 00:33:36,610
are not allowed to be locked.

662
00:33:37,050 --> 00:33:37,780
The Hanshan Banquet

663
00:33:37,930 --> 00:33:39,170
is a feast

664
00:33:39,330 --> 00:33:40,230
for all the sojourners.

665
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:42,110
Commander Su once deduced

666
00:33:43,030 --> 00:33:44,360
that if Prefectural Governor Li was still alive,

667
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:46,100
he must be hiding in Hanshan.

668
00:33:46,870 --> 00:33:48,070
If we want to find him,

669
00:33:48,430 --> 00:33:49,570
we have to do it in these three days.

670
00:33:51,050 --> 00:33:52,560
But I haven't seen the prefectural governor.

671
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:55,240
I'm afraid we need to depend on Minister He

672
00:33:56,210 --> 00:33:57,450
and Yingtao.

673
00:33:59,010 --> 00:34:00,520
When will the Hanshan Banquet

674
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:02,210
start?

675
00:34:02,420 --> 00:34:03,540
It'll start as soon as it gets dark.

676
00:34:05,910 --> 00:34:07,550
Minister He, please

677
00:34:07,950 --> 00:34:09,080
take Yingtao with us.

678
00:34:09,429 --> 00:34:10,659
Let's go to the Hanshan Banquet

679
00:34:11,230 --> 00:34:12,650
tonight.

680
00:34:12,870 --> 00:34:18,719
[Hanshan]

681
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:15,460
Come on.

682
00:34:15,659 --> 00:34:16,860
Let's go.

683
00:34:21,210 --> 00:34:21,850
Good wine.

684
00:34:21,949 --> 00:34:22,980
Come on.

685
00:34:23,630 --> 00:34:24,699
Hurry up.

686
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:32,650
It really looks like the Ghost Market in Chang'an.

687
00:34:33,179 --> 00:34:33,860
I like it.

688
00:34:34,889 --> 00:34:35,460
He Xi.

689
00:34:36,210 --> 00:34:37,590
Why didn't you bring us here earlier?

690
00:34:38,270 --> 00:34:39,380
The poor living in Hanshan

691
00:34:39,889 --> 00:34:40,960
don't need to spend a coin here.

692
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:42,980
Who was so kind

693
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:44,159
to build Hanshan?

694
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:46,400
Worshippers of Tuo God.

695
00:34:47,610 --> 00:34:48,590
Worshippers of Tuo God?

696
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:51,440
We come here this time

697
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:53,810
to get blessed by Tuo God.

698
00:34:54,489 --> 00:34:55,699
Watch your mouth.

699
00:34:57,610 --> 00:34:58,730
I don't like drinking,

700
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:00,690
so I can't remember the date.

701
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:02,720
If Mr. Zeng hadn't reminded me,

702
00:35:03,170 --> 00:35:03,960
I wouldn't remember

703
00:35:03,990 --> 00:35:05,310
that the three-day Hanshan Banquet had arrived.

704
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:08,800
Mr. Zeng is about to resign.

705
00:35:09,390 --> 00:35:11,020
In the future, Ninghu...

706
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:12,190
That's right.

707
00:35:12,950 --> 00:35:13,750
He was worried.

708
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:16,520
That's why he came to me.

709
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:17,990
I'll talk to you about it later.

710
00:35:18,090 --> 00:35:18,500
Okay.

711
00:35:18,580 --> 00:35:19,820
What's the Hanshan Banquet?

712
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:23,790
Three days before the Double Third Festival every year,

713
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:25,380
Tuo God will hold a banquet

714
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:26,420
at Goddwill House in Hanshan

715
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:28,890
and enjoy it with those who are blessed by him.

716
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:29,940
By the way,

717
00:35:30,350 --> 00:35:31,790
sometimes, he throws money on the spot.

718
00:35:32,450 --> 00:35:33,390
That's why tonight is

719
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:34,780
the most bustling time here.

720
00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:35,460
Get out of the way!

721
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:36,670
Move! Move!

722
00:35:37,230 --> 00:35:38,550
Give money to the poor?

723
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:40,210
Are the Worshippers of Tuo God so kind?

724
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:44,060
Who are you?

725
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:45,640
How dare you slander the Shrine!

726
00:35:45,860 --> 00:35:46,860
Without the protection of the Shrine,

727
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:47,930
how can people like us

728
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:49,250
have a place to live?

729
00:35:51,460 --> 00:35:52,340
I told you.

730
00:35:52,470 --> 00:35:53,470
Watch your mouth!

731
00:35:54,940 --> 00:35:57,260
We dare not slander the Shrine.

732
00:35:57,390 --> 00:35:58,590
We come here

733
00:35:59,070 --> 00:36:00,710
to burn incense

734
00:36:00,730 --> 00:36:01,540
for Tuo God.

735
00:36:01,650 --> 00:36:02,250
Yes. Yes.

736
00:36:03,810 --> 00:36:04,720
That's more like it.

737
00:36:08,380 --> 00:36:09,060
Slowly.

738
00:36:09,910 --> 00:36:12,810
[Goodwill House]

739
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:17,080
Goodwill House

740
00:36:17,620 --> 00:36:18,470
is the most bustling place

741
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:19,750
in Hanshan.

742
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:20,530
If we can't find

743
00:36:20,570 --> 00:36:21,600
Prefectural Governor Li's whereabouts here,

744
00:36:23,010 --> 00:36:23,930
it is hard to find him elsewhere.

745
00:36:27,740 --> 00:36:29,500
Come on, drink.

746
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:29,600
[Tuo God Wine]

747
00:36:29,860 --> 00:36:30,460
Fill it up.

748
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:33,010
To Tuo God.

749
00:36:33,030 --> 00:36:36,880
[The house is full of guests]

750
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:34,140
To Tuo God.

751
00:37:15,530 --> 00:37:16,090
OK.

752
00:37:16,130 --> 00:37:16,410
Drink!

753
00:37:16,620 --> 00:37:17,270
Great!

754
00:37:17,540 --> 00:37:19,020
No one entertains the guests.

755
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:20,580
Isn't there any staff here?

756
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:22,250
They don't need to pay for anything,

757
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:23,880
so there is no staff.

758
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:28,470
The Tuo God Wine is here.

759
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:31,300
Tuo God Wine.

760
00:37:32,630 --> 00:37:33,660
Is this real?

761
00:37:33,820 --> 00:37:34,700
Of course it's real.

762
00:37:35,370 --> 00:37:36,470
From tonight

763
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:37,230
to the Double Third Festival three days later,

764
00:37:37,570 --> 00:37:38,520
there will be enough Tuo God Wine.

765
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:39,460
You can have as much as you like.

766
00:37:40,450 --> 00:37:41,350
Look.

767
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:43,700
Others can't get it by any means,

768
00:37:43,950 --> 00:37:45,140
but people here can drink freely.

769
00:37:45,340 --> 00:37:46,940
Isn't it irritating?

770
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:48,070
Officer Ma.

771
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:48,830
Pour some wine.

772
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:53,920
This

773
00:37:54,340 --> 00:37:55,110
is the place

774
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:57,200
where Tuo God lived before he was reborn.

775
00:37:57,660 --> 00:37:58,290
So,

776
00:37:58,700 --> 00:37:59,970
as long as you are naturalized in Hanshan,

777
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:02,290
all taxes will be exempted.

778
00:38:02,870 --> 00:38:04,060
Prefectural Governor Li

779
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:04,820
likes this place very much.

780
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:07,300
He has patrolled Hanshan many times.

781
00:38:10,930 --> 00:38:12,890
I've been drinking for half of my life.

782
00:38:13,050 --> 00:38:14,140
I've never drunk

783
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:15,000
such mellow wine.

784
00:38:15,650 --> 00:38:16,820
Drink it. Hurry!

785
00:38:17,310 --> 00:38:18,510
It's really good.

786
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:20,600
No wonder it's exclusively for Tuo God.

787
00:38:28,890 --> 00:38:29,580
Are you done?

788
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:31,090
Why are we here?

789
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:33,640
Right.

790
00:38:34,050 --> 00:38:35,370
Don't drink too much.

791
00:38:35,690 --> 00:38:37,110
We're here to look for someone.

792
00:38:37,930 --> 00:38:39,810
But we have to finish it first.

793
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:41,560
This is Tuo God Wine!

794
00:38:44,660 --> 00:38:45,500
Delicious!

795
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:47,360
He Xi.

796
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:51,230
Someone asked me to give it to you.

797
00:38:55,170 --> 00:38:56,640
[It's dangerous here. Leave now.]

798
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:56,340
It's dangerous here.

799
00:38:56,890 --> 00:38:57,560
Leave now.

800
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:02,330
It's dangerous here.

801
00:39:02,830 --> 00:39:03,610
Let's get out of here.

802
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:05,290
Fed, stop drinking.

803
00:39:05,710 --> 00:39:06,580
We have to go.

804
00:39:06,810 --> 00:39:07,930
I haven't had enough.

805
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:08,840
I'll drink more.

806
00:39:20,780 --> 00:39:22,140
Is it Prefectural Governor Li?

807
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:51,040
It is an indecent assault!

808
00:39:51,060 --> 00:39:51,620
I...

809
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:53,890
I was trying to save your life.

810
00:39:54,020 --> 00:39:54,400
You...

811
00:39:57,270 --> 00:39:57,790
Are you hurt?

812
00:39:57,820 --> 00:39:58,390
No.

813
00:40:02,590 --> 00:40:04,380
I might be scratched by an arrow just now.

814
00:40:04,970 --> 00:40:05,580
It doesn't matter.

815
00:40:06,970 --> 00:40:07,800
Was that

816
00:40:08,340 --> 00:40:09,920
really your father, Prefectural Governor Li?

817
00:40:10,220 --> 00:40:10,980
It must be him.

818
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:12,030
I want to find my father.

819
00:40:13,350 --> 00:40:14,250
You can't go out.

820
00:40:16,450 --> 00:40:17,420
Don't go out!

821
00:40:18,270 --> 00:40:18,760
Hurry!

822
00:41:26,180 --> 00:41:27,810
The alligator's hearing is abnormal!

823
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:29,160
Don't move!

824
00:42:21,980 --> 00:42:22,620
Fed.

825
00:42:23,450 --> 00:42:25,890
Think about how to subdue this beast.

826
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:27,390
Do you think it's useful to ask this drunkard?

827
00:42:28,810 --> 00:42:30,810
Tianzhu Incense is its favorite fragrance.

828
00:42:31,170 --> 00:42:33,020
After smelling it, it will sleep happily.

829
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:33,800
Go find it.

830
00:42:34,090 --> 00:42:34,830
Tell me

831
00:42:34,860 --> 00:42:35,740
where we can find it now!

832
00:42:35,990 --> 00:42:37,180

00:45:00,410 --> 00:45:02,460
♫The people are in peace♫

860
00:45:02,490 --> 00:45:06,920
♫Carving right and wrong into a clear heart♫

861
00:45:07,650 --> 00:45:09,010
♫The truth♫

862
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:12,770
♫Will reinterpret this justice♫

863
00:45:13,020 --> 00:45:19,130
♫Even if there are a thousand sails, it's not a waste of time♫

864
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:25,690
♫What I am afraid of is the unrighted wrong♫

865
00:45:26,300 --> 00:45:28,220
♫What is the meaning of life and death?♫

866
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:32,570
♫I'll paint the sunshine into the landscape♫

867
00:45:32,890 --> 00:45:34,610
♫The spirit of righteousness♫

868
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:38,740
♫Exists for the one I care♫
