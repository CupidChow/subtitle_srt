[Episode 28]

4
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:47,130
Look at you.

5
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:50,420
So masculine.

6
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:53,509
I can't help but

7
00:01:55,570 --> 00:01:57,220
be drawn to you.

8
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:02,160
Of course I'm masculine.

9
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:05,320
You know what I do for a living?

10
00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:07,820
Exorcising evil spirits.

11
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:11,009
Stop kidding.

12
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:11,700
You don't believe me?

13
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:12,740
No.

14
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:17,570
Tell me something.

15
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:19,300
Since that Tocharian woman

16
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:21,530
is a regular guest in your inn,

17
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:24,400
have you seen the Face Flowers she sells?

18
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:32,490
Why are you interested in that?

19
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,770
Everyone in Luoyang is talking about that.

20
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:40,800
I'm curious.

21
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:43,730
Lady Hu Shisi,

22
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:46,950
have you seen them or not?

23
00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:51,230
Of course I have.

24
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:53,900
I even possess some.

25
00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:56,770
Do you want to have a look?

26
00:02:58,540 --> 00:02:59,480
Where's them?

27
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:01,950
In my room.

28
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:05,070
Come upstairs with me.

29
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:09,510
Fill the glass.

30
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:28,180
You have a sword with you.

31
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:32,810
Will it be used to force me into obedience later?

32
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:34,980
Cut the bullshit.

33
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,350
Do you have

34
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:37,300
the Face Flowers or not?

35
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:39,210
Of course I do.

36
00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:43,340
Otherwise, how do I manage

37
00:03:44,570 --> 00:03:46,970
to have flawless skin at my age?

38
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:49,200
Aren't the Face Flowers poisonous?

39
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:51,079
Besides,

40
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:52,930
you're not old.

41
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:55,350
The year when I left the imperial palace,

42
00:03:56,810 --> 00:03:57,600
Emperor Yang of Sui

43
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:00,660
enjoyed flowers in Jiangdu.

44
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,690
You're out of your mind.

45
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:06,720
Almost one hundred years have passed

46
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:08,260
since Emperor Yang of Sui visited Yangzhou.

47
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:09,500
That's total gibberish.

48
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:12,770
Are you scared?

49
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:15,140
Then let it be gibberish.

50
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:18,899
Follow me.

51
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:01,190
I can tell

52
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,280
you are not a lesser mortal.

53
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,580
So I must not skip the niceties.

54
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:09,130
Let me light the incense first.

55
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:16,170
This place is treacherous.

56
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:18,220
So is that incense, right?

57
00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:26,140
You'll know

58
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:28,940
after you smell it.

59
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:31,620
You think I'll harm you?

60
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:34,140
I'll be heartbroken if you're harmed.

61
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:36,120
Why does it smell like mint?

62
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:38,620
See? I mean you no harm.

63
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:41,580
After you inhale the scent of my incense,

64
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:43,620
you will be clearheaded.

65
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:45,620
You'll know

66
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:48,360
whether

67
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:50,040
you truly love me or not.

68
00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:54,930
Let's talk about the Face Flowers.

69
00:06:03,890 --> 00:06:05,710
What's the rush?

70
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,610
You don't have them, do you?

71
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:11,660
If I didn't,

72
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:15,440
how could I stay young forever?

73
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:19,020
The Face Flowers were a precious gift

74
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,840
given by the Persians to the Emperor of Sui.

75
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:22,460
When I left the imperial palace,

76
00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:24,280
I stole a box of them out.

77
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:27,760
So many years passed. They're dried now.

78
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:29,760
But soaking them in water

79
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:32,040
can make them as fresh as they once were.

80
00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:35,690
They can help me

81
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:37,570
stay young forever.

82
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,720
Are you really from the Sui Dynasty?

83
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:45,490
Why don't you help me exorcise evil spirits now?

84
00:06:46,909 --> 00:06:47,950
I have

85
00:06:49,970 --> 00:06:52,030
been suffering from them.

86
00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:53,950
Tell me where the flowers are.

87
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:01,850
If you stare at it,

88
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:04,980
you will see

89
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:08,350
a face blooming like a flower.

90
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:14,560
Someone is coming.

91
00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:18,350
Who cares?

92
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:20,610
Tonight,

93
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:22,940
you're my little darling.

94
00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:38,580
What a buzz kill.

95
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:40,790
The sound

96
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:41,860
is approaching.

97
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:56,520
You...

98
00:07:57,460 --> 00:07:58,740
What's that incense?

99
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,890
A mint-flavored incense.

100
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:53,260
My word, there's really an evil spirit!

101
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:29,800
Where's Su Wuming?

102
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:31,510
Damn.

103
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:49,400
Su Wuming.

104
00:09:57,220 --> 00:09:57,820
Su Wuming.

105
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:01,890
[Paradise Inn]

106
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:16,690
That Tocharian woman!

107
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:17,280
Go get her!

108
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:18,360
-Yes. -Yes.

109
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:23,380
What happened upstairs?

110
00:10:23,530 --> 00:10:24,530
Who did you fight with?

111
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:25,620
Move.

112
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:30,650
Hey there. Why are you still up, dear?

113
00:10:43,570 --> 00:10:44,940
Lu Lingfeng is so unreliable.

114
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:46,370
How could he let you do something so dangerous alone?

115
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:46,980
Su Wuming.

116
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:50,740
Where is she?

117
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:52,220
She ran away?

118
00:10:53,430 --> 00:10:54,520
Weren't you here for an autopsy?

119
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:55,620
The dead came back to life?

120
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:58,180
Why did it take you so long to find the female inn owner?

121
00:10:58,210 --> 00:10:59,090
I almost...

122
00:10:59,200 --> 00:10:59,700
I…

123
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:02,180
I got into trouble.

124
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:05,490
Thank you, Miss Yingtao.

125
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:06,370
You saved me.

126
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:09,380
What trouble did you get into?

127
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:12,340
An evil spirit.

128
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:13,020
Yes.

129
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:16,100
An evil spirit in bronze armor.

130
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:25,580
Seems that the Paradise Inn

131
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:27,050
is not just an inn.

132
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:30,460
What happened

133
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:31,690
with that Tocharian woman?

134
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:37,340
When I was examining

135
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:39,070
the corpse, which it wasn't,

136
00:11:39,090 --> 00:11:41,610
I noticed that the nails of her fingers and toes

137
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:42,880
were all purple.

138
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:43,820
So,

139
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:47,820
I checked her nose.

140
00:11:48,490 --> 00:11:49,830
Why did you check her nose?

141
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,200
Because I suspect

142
00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:54,600
she used the Soul Returning Incense.

143
00:11:57,260 --> 00:11:59,060
She came back to life?

144
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:01,570
In the Chang'an black tea case,

145
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:02,830
the Soul Returning Incense

146
00:12:03,050 --> 00:12:03,760
was used

147
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:04,610
on the body of Miss Dou, right?

148
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:05,500
Right.

149
00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:08,750
Fed told me about that incense.

150
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:10,220
Later,

151
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:12,560
I did some research and learned

152
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:15,710
that applying it on the dead's bodies

153
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:17,770
can keep them from rotting for days.

154
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:20,180
If you put it in your nose,

155
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:23,380
it can temporarily shut down your breath.

156
00:12:23,770 --> 00:12:26,300
That's why it's called the Soul Returning Incense.

157
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:29,370
In the past, sorcerers used it

158
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:31,740
to temporarily leave the mortal world

159
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:33,610
and approach the gods.

160
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:36,100
After that incense

161
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:37,900
shuts down the user's breath,

162
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:40,500
the user's nails

163
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:42,380
will all turn purple.

164
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:44,620
It's wicked.

165
00:12:45,490 --> 00:12:46,690
Not something good.

166
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:48,220
In that case,

167
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:49,960
after that Tocharian woman

168
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:51,750
was stopped in the inn by Xing Ying,

169
00:12:52,610 --> 00:12:53,370
she decided to use

170
00:12:53,490 --> 00:12:54,850
the custom of the Double Fifth Day

171
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:57,380
and the Soul Returning Incense to escape.

172
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:00,570
However, you went there to examine her body.

173
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:02,350
Alright.

174
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:03,940
Let's talk about you.

175
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:06,880
What's the evil spirit you mentioned?

176
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:15,060
I don't know who was under that bronze armor.

177
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:16,300
He was very powerful,

178
00:13:16,690 --> 00:13:17,550
and hard to defeat.

179
00:13:17,890 --> 00:13:18,310
By the way,

180
00:13:18,830 --> 00:13:20,670
the inn owner is called Lady Hu Shisi.

181
00:13:21,130 --> 00:13:23,450
She claimed to be an imperial maid of the Sui Dynasty.

182
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:25,930
She also said she had the Face Flowers.

183
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:28,500
From the Sui Dynasty?

184
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:32,010
That would make her over one hundred years old.

185
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:33,610
Nonsense.

186
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:36,740
Did she buy

187
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:37,980
her Face Flowers

188
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:38,900
from the Tocharian woman?

189
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:41,480
She said she stole them

190
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:42,240
from the imperial palace of the Sui Dynasty.

191
00:13:42,810 --> 00:13:43,430
She also said

192
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:45,940
it's because of those flowers

193
00:13:46,190 --> 00:13:47,690
that she doesn't age.

194
00:13:49,610 --> 00:13:50,800
Bullshit!

195
00:13:52,650 --> 00:13:53,370
This inn

196
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:54,760
is dangerous and wicked.

197
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:56,120
We must leave immediately.

198
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:57,430
Leave?

199
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:00,560
You want to stay here?

200
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:01,650
You almost

201
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:02,480
got yourself killed.

202
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:04,020
Don't put Su Wuming in danger again.

203
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:07,590
I was weakened by that incense.

204
00:14:08,530 --> 00:14:09,400
It smelled like mint

205
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,470
at first.

206
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:12,430
I felt refreshed after smelling it,

207
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:14,340
so I let my guard slip.

208
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:15,820
We can't leave now.

209
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:17,610
That's too humiliating.

210
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:21,830
You are captivated

211
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:23,170
by that beautiful inn owner, aren't you?

212
00:14:23,210 --> 00:14:23,960
That's why you wouldn't leave.

213
00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:25,220
I agree.

214
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:25,780
You...

215
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:27,620
No more bickering.

216
00:14:29,290 --> 00:14:30,380
After what happened tonight,

217
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:32,930
no matter how wicked this inn is,

218
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:34,500
and how mysterious the guests here are,

219
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:35,700
nothing will happen

220
00:14:35,850 --> 00:14:37,340
in a short period of time.

221
00:14:38,070 --> 00:14:40,220
We need to leave this place

222
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:43,020
to better observe what's going on here.

223
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:45,860
Lu Lingfeng, let's go.

224
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:51,980
It's already after curfew.

225
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,200
I don't think it's wise for you two gentlemen

226
00:14:55,530 --> 00:14:57,450
to walk around at night with a lady.

227
00:14:58,010 --> 00:14:59,220
Aren't you afraid of being caught?

228
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:04,480
Your inn is indeed an old one.

229
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:08,940
I've heard that the inn owner is also a quaint beauty.

230
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,730
Aren't you the master?

231
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:15,040
You share everything with your servant?

232
00:15:15,690 --> 00:15:16,980
I told him that because I like you.

233
00:15:20,950 --> 00:15:21,360
By the way,

234
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,850
my servant wants me to remind you

235
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:25,630
that Luoyang

236
00:15:25,930 --> 00:15:27,140
is not an ordinary place.

237
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:29,360
Your little spooky tricks

238
00:15:29,730 --> 00:15:31,170
may get you into trouble.

239
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:36,560
Su Wuming.

240
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:38,380
Which one of you is the servant?

241
00:15:38,810 --> 00:15:39,690
You or him?

242
00:15:40,390 --> 00:15:41,360
I'm confused.

243
00:15:42,170 --> 00:15:44,860
You're confused because this inn

244
00:15:44,890 --> 00:15:46,550
has scared you out of your wits.

245
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:47,760
Let's go.

246
00:15:57,700 --> 00:16:00,500
[Administrator's Residence]

247
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:05,660
Who was that man in black?

248
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:07,960
Why did he save me?

249
00:16:09,530 --> 00:16:10,370
I must

250
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:11,830
have missed

251
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:12,940
an important clue.

252
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:42,480
Darling, I wasn't expecting you.

253
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,450
You've really fallen in love with me?

254
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,300
Where's that man?

255
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:49,480
You're the only one in my heart.

256
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:52,070
I would in no way let him get on my bed.

257
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:53,340
I left that door

258
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:55,120
open especially for you.

259
00:16:55,710 --> 00:16:56,510
Cut the crap!

260
00:16:57,190 --> 00:16:58,120
Tell me which room

261
00:16:58,140 --> 00:16:59,450
that man in black last night is in.

262
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:01,440
Isn't him with you?

263
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:02,860
Tell me now,

264
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:04,180
or I'll cut your face

265
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:05,990
with my sword

266
00:17:06,089 --> 00:17:07,710
and see how old you actually are.

267
00:17:08,829 --> 00:17:10,220
He's on the second floor,

268
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:12,670
in the room opposite the one

269
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:13,420
you once stayed in.

270
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:23,780
The Face Flowers.

271
00:17:24,869 --> 00:17:26,599
Didn't you steal a box of them

272
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:27,780
from the imperial palace of the Sui Dynasty?

273
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,740
If you really like me,

274
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:31,390
give me some of them.

275
00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:33,710
You're a man.

276
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,780
What do you need them for?

277
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:40,830
No problem.

278
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:56,460
Great General!

279
00:17:56,980 --> 00:17:57,940
Not here.

280
00:17:58,140 --> 00:17:58,680
Let's go inside.

281
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:08,960
[Administrator's Residence]

282
00:18:08,050 --> 00:18:09,070
Sure enough. Administrator Su

283
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:10,630
has taken office.

284
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:13,890
Are you Minister Xing?

285
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:15,950
The administrator

286
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:17,120
knew you would come.

287
00:18:17,790 --> 00:18:18,740
I'll take you to see him now.

288
00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:22,210
Your presence is already an honor.

289
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:23,890
You don't have to bring any gifts.

290
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:25,230
You're so considerate.

291
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:25,920
Sorry.

292
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:28,050
I need to give it to Administrator Su myself.

293
00:18:31,450 --> 00:18:34,130
You've been working hard on the cases, Minister Xing.

294
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:35,620
Please sit down.

295
00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:37,710
Thank you, Administrator Su.

296
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:40,790
I've heard

297
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:42,970
that you've been fretting over

298
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:44,100
whether to take the position or not.

299
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:46,570
So I bring you a kind of herb.

300
00:18:47,310 --> 00:18:49,820
It can help with depression and anxiety.

301
00:19:00,850 --> 00:19:02,060
What kind of herb is this?

302
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:03,680
It's called Aspiration.

303
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:07,970
Aspiration?

304
00:19:10,990 --> 00:19:13,190
You're here to tell me the famous story

305
00:19:13,290 --> 00:19:15,670
about Prime Minister Xie An of the East Jin Dynasty?

306
00:19:17,970 --> 00:19:18,690
I dare not.

307
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:21,740
It's true that the herb can alleviate anxiety.

308
00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:26,340
Back then, Xie An was determined to be a hermit

309
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:28,190
and had no intention to serve the emperor.

310
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:30,460
Later, he had no choice but to accept the emperor's offer

311
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:33,250
and left his hermitage.

312
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:35,480
People said he made that choice

313
00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:38,310
merely for the prosperity of his family.

314
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:40,680
Therefore, someone used this herb

315
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:43,210
to mock him.

316
00:19:43,730 --> 00:19:46,920
This herb is also called Little Grass.

317
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:50,270
That guy implied that Xie An once was an honorable man with aspirations,

318
00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:50,780
but

319
00:19:51,570 --> 00:19:52,800
he became ordinary after succumbing to secular desires.

320
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,050
I don't mean that.

321
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:58,300
You're already the administrator.

322
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:00,120
No one dares to compare you to grass.

323
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:02,240
In my opinion,

324
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:05,570
this herb doesn't have two names.

325
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:09,300
Only its leaves above the ground are called Little Grass.

326
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:11,220
Its roots

327
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:13,470
are called Aspiration.

328
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:17,290
I think I'm just like this herb.

329
00:20:18,190 --> 00:20:21,250
My aspirations are deeply buried underground.

330
00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:24,590
No one knows what I really want.

331
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:26,570
People can only see

332
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:29,220
the small part of me

333
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:31,710
above the ground.

334
00:20:34,490 --> 00:20:34,870
Well...

335
00:20:37,630 --> 00:20:38,670
Administrator Su,

336
00:20:38,930 --> 00:20:40,550
sorry that I misunderstood you.

337
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:49,700
It's not your fault.

338
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:52,210
When Queen Wei was in power,

339
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:53,980
government posts became salable products.

340
00:20:54,190 --> 00:20:56,950
Anyone with conscience

341
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:59,600
would hate informal officials.

342
00:21:00,170 --> 00:21:01,650
Your indignation

343
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:03,120
proves

344
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:06,010
that you are an upright man.

345
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:07,600
Thank you for your understanding.

346
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:10,120
All right.

347
00:21:11,130 --> 00:21:12,130
Let's talk about the case.

348
00:21:12,390 --> 00:21:14,230
That Tocharian woman is good at hiding.

349
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,280
We failed to catch her last night.

350
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:17,660
When the city gates opened this morning,

351
00:21:18,050 --> 00:21:18,880
she sneaked out.

352
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:21,910
We followed her to the Green Peak in the eastern suburb.

353
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:23,110
There,

354
00:21:24,070 --> 00:21:24,670
we lost her again.

355
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:28,250
I suspect

356
00:21:28,930 --> 00:21:29,870
that she went to the Sky Garden.

357
00:21:31,530 --> 00:21:32,770
Sky Garden?

358
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:35,180
After Li Yue became the Resident Regent of Dongdu,

359
00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:37,110
he built a garden

360
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:38,360
in a mountain in the suburbs.

361
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:39,600
There's a shrine of the Xian God there.

362
00:21:40,490 --> 00:21:41,880
It's high up the mountain in the clouds,

363
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:42,860
looking like

364
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:44,660
it's floating in the air.

365
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:46,520
So people call it

366
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:47,550
the Sky Garden.

367
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:48,690
Su Wuming.

368
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:53,260
Xing Ying.

369
00:21:53,370 --> 00:21:53,980
General.

370
00:21:54,370 --> 00:21:55,810
Greetings, General.

371
00:21:58,020 --> 00:21:58,660
Rise.

372
00:22:00,390 --> 00:22:01,010
General.

373
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:02,140
You…

374
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,520
Don't call me General.

375
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:05,300
I'm in no official position now.

376
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:09,700
Lu Lingfeng

377
00:22:09,730 --> 00:22:11,220
is my personal staff now.

378
00:22:12,250 --> 00:22:13,370
Personal staff?

379
00:22:13,490 --> 00:22:13,970
What?

380
00:22:14,410 --> 00:22:14,950
You got something to say?

381
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:17,040
No.

382
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:19,070
Lu Lingfeng,

383
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:20,850
where did you go last night?

384
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:22,400
Did you go to…

385
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:34,410
Face Flowers?

386
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:38,920
Why are these flowers dried?

387
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:40,290
By the way,

388
00:22:40,930 --> 00:22:41,580
just now,

389
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:43,220
I was too busy talking with Administrator Su

390
00:22:43,450 --> 00:22:44,090
to tell you

391
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:45,280
that I also brought some Face Flowers.

392
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:50,660
I got these flowers

393
00:22:51,050 --> 00:22:52,420
from the buyers.

394
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:55,480
My flowers are not the ones

395
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,240
the Tocharian woman sells in Luoyang.

396
00:22:58,060 --> 00:22:59,100
They are from the Sui Dynasty.

397
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:01,550
Did you get them

398
00:23:02,030 --> 00:23:03,860
from Lady Hu Shisi?

399
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:06,430
I think

400
00:23:07,210 --> 00:23:08,520
maybe she didn't lie.

401
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:10,340
She is from the Sui Dynasty.

402
00:23:11,230 --> 00:23:12,020
Sui?

403
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:20,750
One is dark and the other is light.

404
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:22,780
The light one is more elegant.

405
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:25,040
This fresh one

406
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:26,610
looks better,

407
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:29,000
but it's so vicious.

408
00:23:30,690 --> 00:23:33,910
This flower grows in a valley

409
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:36,920
1,000 kilometers away from the southwest of the Arab Empire.

410
00:23:37,310 --> 00:23:38,560
It's recorded

411
00:23:39,130 --> 00:23:40,500
that there are trees

412
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:42,900
which can grow rare flowers.

413
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:44,600
If you stare at and observe them,

414
00:23:44,830 --> 00:23:46,300
you will find them look like human's faces.

415
00:23:47,410 --> 00:23:48,790
But as far as I know,

416
00:23:48,890 --> 00:23:50,820
this kind of flower is not poisonous itself,

417
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:54,150
nor will it decay people's skin.

418
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:55,250
Most importantly,

419
00:23:57,050 --> 00:23:58,250
the central region

420
00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:00,780
is not the birthplace of those trees.

421
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:02,630
Sworn Brother.

422
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:04,120
How do you know

423
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:05,230
the trees grow in the central region?

424
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:08,150
The flowers sold by the Tocharian woman

425
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:10,120
were newly picked.

426
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:12,160
Yes.

427
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:13,980
Why didn't I think of it?

428
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:15,250
The dark one

429
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:17,250
is a dried flower from the Sui dynasty,

430
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:19,280
while the light one

431
00:24:20,190 --> 00:24:21,800
is a poisonous one harming people.

432
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:23,660
Fed.

433
00:24:24,410 --> 00:24:25,370
You are good at herbs.

434
00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:27,040
Is there something in this world

435
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:28,530
that can make people's flesh and skin decayed

436
00:24:28,850 --> 00:24:30,170
at the last moment?

437
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:35,700
Of course, there is,

438
00:24:36,210 --> 00:24:37,690
but it's rare.

439
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:40,460
If you mix Baohuang from Persia as the main ingredient

440
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:43,640
with some Guichou of the Miao ethnic group,

441
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:45,900
then add

442
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:47,430
something else to it,

443
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:48,940
and finally make the mixture a kind of incense,

444
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:50,580
it will produce

445
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:52,020
a unique flavor.

446
00:24:53,110 --> 00:24:55,660
At first, it smells splendid

447
00:24:56,380 --> 00:24:58,580
and even refreshing.

448
00:24:58,980 --> 00:24:59,940
Just like mint.

449
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:02,550
Then, it makes people hallucinate,

450
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:04,650
and causes myasthenia.

451
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:05,880
But

452
00:25:06,190 --> 00:25:07,620
it only works on men.

453
00:25:08,290 --> 00:25:10,860
That's why it's also known as the "Husband Incense".

454
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:13,900
This belonged to the imperial court of the Sui Dynasty.

455
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,730
It was indeed used in the imperial court of the Sui Dynasty.

456
00:25:17,410 --> 00:25:19,500
I've experienced the power of it.

457
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:22,470
But that's not

458
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:23,070
what I want to ask.

459
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:24,490
-Calm down. -I...

460
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:26,160
I haven't finished yet.

461
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:30,090
If we mix Guichou of the Miao ethnic group as the main ingredient

462
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,620
with a little Baohuang

463
00:25:35,170 --> 00:25:38,210
and some strange herbs,

464
00:25:39,410 --> 00:25:40,850
and then soak the skin in it,

465
00:25:40,870 --> 00:25:42,720
after some days,

466
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:45,560
it may make

467
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:48,660
the flesh and skin decayed all of a sudden.

468
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:52,190
We can buy

469
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:53,300
Guichou.

470
00:25:54,190 --> 00:25:55,500
But Baohuang

471
00:25:55,850 --> 00:25:57,060
was banned

472
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:58,770
as early as the period of Gaozong.

473
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:03,580
This case is trickier than I thought.

474
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:05,200
You two

475
00:26:05,510 --> 00:26:07,690
should quickly go to the Sky Garden

476
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:09,740
and search for the Tocharian woman.

477
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:11,130
Yes, sir.

478
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:14,440
[Blessing Temple]

479
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:20,900
[Back Meditation Abode]

480
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:24,880
Your Highness.

481
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:26,770
Su Wuming has taken office.

482
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:29,280
You may just meditate here

483
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:30,350
these days,

484
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:33,260
and see how he looks into the case of the Face Flower.

485
00:26:35,530 --> 00:26:39,170
But I feel insecure.

486
00:26:40,050 --> 00:26:41,930
You mean the Crown Prince?

487
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:44,810
Your news

488
00:26:44,890 --> 00:26:46,560
was released in time.

489
00:26:47,570 --> 00:26:49,950
But he stayed in Dongdu,

490
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:51,740
wanting to see my ending.

491
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:56,390
It really makes me sad.

492
00:26:57,100 --> 00:26:57,620
Your Highness.

493
00:26:57,740 --> 00:26:58,750
Your health is more important.

494
00:26:58,940 --> 00:27:00,130
Don't be angry.

495
00:27:01,450 --> 00:27:02,370
Your Highness.

496
00:27:02,650 --> 00:27:03,670
Prefectural Governor Gao is here.

497
00:27:10,630 --> 00:27:11,360
Come in.

498
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:19,900
Your Highness.

499
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:21,860
I've read

500
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:23,020
the list you submitted.

501
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:24,500
In all these years,

502
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:26,160
you've done a good job

503
00:27:26,450 --> 00:27:27,690
in Dongdu for me.

504
00:27:29,450 --> 00:27:30,600
Once it's finished,

505
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:33,640
everyone on the list will get promoted.

506
00:27:35,510 --> 00:27:36,150
Of course,

507
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:39,940
you are the one I rely on the most.

508
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:42,460
Thank you for your trust.

509
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:45,620
I've been loyal to Your Highness for years.

510
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:47,650
I swear my loyalty to you.

511
00:27:48,260 --> 00:27:50,590
But I got poisoned by the Face Flowers.

512
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:51,990
I'm afraid...

513
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:52,820
Your Highness.

514
00:27:53,250 --> 00:27:55,540
Su Wuming has taken office to investigate the case.

515
00:27:55,970 --> 00:27:57,970
I believe it won't take long to find out the truth.

516
00:27:58,540 --> 00:28:00,030
Do you believe

517
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:01,500
that he can solve this case,

518
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:02,820
get the antidote,

519
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:05,130
and save my life?

520
00:28:06,830 --> 00:28:09,030
Detective Di's favorite disciple

521
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:10,600
must be capable.

522
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:13,050
More importantly, Your Highness

523
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:14,940
is blessed.

524
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:16,640
Nothing evil will happen to you.

525
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:18,060
Go back

526
00:28:18,470 --> 00:28:20,800
and gather all the officials on the list.

527
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:22,420
Tell them

528
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:24,320
that they must believe

529
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:26,280
Su Wuming can help me

530
00:28:26,310 --> 00:28:27,420
get through this.

531
00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:30,900
Don't be disloyal.

532
00:28:32,290 --> 00:28:33,290
Yes, Your Highness.

533
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:39,000
Please.

534
00:28:46,630 --> 00:28:47,370
Administrator Su.

535
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:49,030
Greetings, Prefectural Governor Gao.

536
00:28:50,150 --> 00:28:51,840
Since Administrator Su has taken office,

537
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:53,890
I'm relieved.

538
00:28:54,370 --> 00:28:56,130
Did Her Highness ask you to come?

539
00:28:57,220 --> 00:28:58,540
Her Highness is waiting for you inside.

540
00:28:59,020 --> 00:28:59,670
Go now.

541
00:29:00,910 --> 00:29:01,550
It's not because Her Highness asked me to come.

542
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:04,500
But because I'm already in charge of this case,

543
00:29:05,010 --> 00:29:07,480
and Her Highness used the Face Flowers.

544
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:09,030
It's risky for her to be poisoned.

545
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:10,500
So I

546
00:29:11,090 --> 00:29:12,290
must come.

547
00:29:22,190 --> 00:29:24,150
Greetings, Your Highness.

548
00:29:25,690 --> 00:29:26,930
Long time no see

549
00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:28,460
since we last met in Chang'an.

550
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:30,630
Yes.

551
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:36,790
You should've worn your official uniform to see me.

552
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:38,440
So stubborn.

553
00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:39,330
What?

554
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:42,300
You don't want to be my official?

555
00:29:44,250 --> 00:29:46,660
But I have started investigating.

556
00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:48,420
You refuse to wear the official uniform,

557
00:29:48,450 --> 00:29:50,020
which means you are demonstrating your attitude to me.

558
00:29:51,190 --> 00:29:51,750
I dare not.

559
00:29:58,370 --> 00:29:58,980
Tell me.

560
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:00,820
Why did you take this case?

561
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:04,230
The people of Luoyang

562
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:05,980
and Your Highness are the most important.

563
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:07,420
What?

564
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:10,350
You prioritize the people before me?

565
00:30:13,970 --> 00:30:14,490
Forget it.

566
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:16,950
You know I'm in danger.

567
00:30:16,990 --> 00:30:18,710
I'm glad you're still willing to take care of me.

568
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:20,500
Su Wuming.

569
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:22,540
I only have six to seven days.

570
00:30:23,230 --> 00:30:24,140
What will you do?

571
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:27,440
I'll try my best to catch the culprit

572
00:30:28,350 --> 00:30:29,230
and find the antidote.

573
00:30:30,750 --> 00:30:31,470
Try your best?

574
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:34,490
It must be the Crown Prince

575
00:30:34,510 --> 00:30:35,680
who wants me dead.

576
00:30:36,370 --> 00:30:37,250
Where is His Majesty?

577
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:38,580
Ask him to do something.

578
00:30:39,570 --> 00:30:40,490
Please calm down, Your Highness.

579
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:41,980
His Majesty has returned to Chang'an.

580
00:30:43,090 --> 00:30:44,240
I want to go back to Chang'an too,

581
00:30:44,570 --> 00:30:45,700
right now.

582
00:30:45,950 --> 00:30:46,510
No.

583
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:48,510
Your Highness just needs to wait.

584
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:50,410
Su Wuming will do my best

585
00:30:50,450 --> 00:30:51,450
to get the antidote as soon as possible.

586
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:52,630
Easier said than done.

587
00:30:53,490 --> 00:30:54,740
What if you can't get it?

588
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:56,860
Instead of waiting for my face to rot,

589
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:58,830
I'd rather die now.

590
00:30:59,730 --> 00:31:00,820
Before I die,

591
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:02,930
I will burn down the entire Luoyang

592
00:31:02,970 --> 00:31:03,790
to let all the people in Luoyang sacrifice for me.

593
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:04,670
Your Highness.

594
00:31:04,990 --> 00:31:05,910
Please don't.

595
00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:08,420
Do you mean I can't die?

596
00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:09,620
Yes.

597
00:31:10,630 --> 00:31:11,460
Why?

598
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:15,870
Even if

599
00:31:17,090 --> 00:31:18,220
Your Highness cares about nothing,

600
00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:21,180
at least think about your children.

601
00:31:25,130 --> 00:31:26,180
Children?

602
00:31:29,590 --> 00:31:30,470
In this world,

603
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:32,100
few people understand me.

604
00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:35,120
You...

605
00:31:36,630 --> 00:31:38,390
I don't understand you sometimes either.

606
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:48,780
You're shivering.

607
00:31:51,090 --> 00:31:53,550
Because I respect you so much.

608
00:31:54,140 --> 00:31:54,820
Look at me.

609
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:58,070
You will try your best to save my life,

610
00:31:58,900 --> 00:31:59,300
right?

611
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:02,160
I will, definitely.

612
00:32:03,570 --> 00:32:04,530
For Your Highness

613
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:06,580
and for the people of Luoyang.

614
00:32:09,470 --> 00:32:11,190
If you hadn't added this last line,

615
00:32:11,540 --> 00:32:12,620
I wouldn't believe you.

616
00:32:13,820 --> 00:32:15,630
You haven't changed.

617
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:16,950
All right.

618
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:18,580
Go on with your case.

619
00:32:22,780 --> 00:32:23,300
Yes.

620
00:32:29,990 --> 00:32:31,340
Just focus on your case and don't worry about me.

621
00:32:31,790 --> 00:32:33,330
I won't kill myself.

622
00:32:34,290 --> 00:32:36,730
It's not because I want the vanity of the world,

623
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:40,410
but because the dynasty can't live without me.

624
00:32:40,890 --> 00:32:42,010
And revitalizing the Tang Dynasty

625
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:43,690
hinges on me.

626
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:51,230
[Sky Garden]

627
00:32:59,590 --> 00:33:00,190
General.

628
00:33:00,730 --> 00:33:01,660
This is the Sky Garden.

629
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:03,740
The Tocharian women disappeared

630
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:04,890
after we lost her.

631
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:07,810
She should be in this garden.

632
00:33:08,470 --> 00:33:09,240
Knock the door.

633
00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:23,920
Who are you?

634
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:26,250
Xing Ying, Minister of Justice of Luozhou.

635
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:27,440
I am ordered to investigate the case.

636
00:33:35,090 --> 00:33:36,160
Minister Xing.

637
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:39,120
Why are you so aggressive?

638
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:41,570
A suspect disappeared here earlier.

639
00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:43,420
So we are here to search this place.

640
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:46,690
There are indeed many people living in the garden.

641
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:48,500
But it is under strict control.

642
00:33:48,580 --> 00:33:50,020
There isn't any criminal.

643
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:51,130
Besides,

644
00:33:52,270 --> 00:33:54,890
the Sky Garden is protected by the government.

645
00:33:55,490 --> 00:33:57,250
Do you want to break the rules

646
00:33:57,940 --> 00:33:59,290
to search inside?

647
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:01,100
No matter what garden it is,

648
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:02,860
since it has been built in the Tang Dynasty,

649
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:05,010
you should abide by the rules of Tang.

650
00:34:05,990 --> 00:34:07,010
Hindering government officials

651
00:34:07,290 --> 00:34:08,530
from searching this place

652
00:34:08,790 --> 00:34:10,670
will be a violation of rules.

653
00:34:10,860 --> 00:34:11,350
This...

654
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:12,880
Minister Xing.

655
00:34:16,139 --> 00:34:18,389
I heard that you brought people here

656
00:34:18,699 --> 00:34:20,250
to investigate the case.

657
00:34:21,550 --> 00:34:23,670
I'm worried that they won't let you in.

658
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:25,739
Looks like I come at the right time.

659
00:34:26,620 --> 00:34:27,460
Resident Regent.

660
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:29,270
Open the door.

661
00:34:30,170 --> 00:34:30,690
Yes.

662
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:39,380
Please.

663
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:54,250
Don't be afraid.

664
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:56,940
During the reign of Emperor Gaozong and Empress Wu Zetian,

665
00:34:57,180 --> 00:35:00,100
the other states offered various exotic animals.

666
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:02,560
Most of them have been kept here.

667
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:05,360
Could it be

668
00:35:06,340 --> 00:35:07,540
the Meteorite Bear that roared just now?

669
00:35:08,060 --> 00:35:09,220
Yes.

670
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:10,620
During the Emperor Gaozong period,

671
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:13,300
Kapilavastu once presented a giant bear

672
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:14,540
called Meteorite.

673
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:16,500
It is powerful enough to catch the white elephant and kill the lion.

674
00:35:17,210 --> 00:35:18,060
I didn't expect

675
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:19,950
it to be kept here.

676
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:21,660
So,

677
00:35:21,860 --> 00:35:23,410
ordinary people are not allowed to come in,

678
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:25,610
because this wild beast

679
00:35:25,950 --> 00:35:27,030
may hurt people.

680
00:35:29,090 --> 00:35:30,180
Who are you?

681
00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:33,630
This is the personal staff

682
00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:36,440
of Su Wuming, Administrator of Luozhou.

683
00:35:37,820 --> 00:35:39,020
Personal staff?

684
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:41,740
It's impressive that you are so knowledgeable.

685
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:44,650
Interesting.

686
00:35:45,220 --> 00:35:47,220
Resident Regent, please

687
00:35:47,260 --> 00:35:48,160
ask everyone here out.

688
00:35:48,650 --> 00:35:49,310
We need to

689
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:50,800
check one by one.

690
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:53,350
They are all worshipping in the inner court.

691
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:56,000
-Please. -Please.

692
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:05,690
Here are all the people

693
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:06,650
living in the garden recently.

694
00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:08,620
He is right.

695
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:10,840
If you don't believe him,

696
00:36:11,450 --> 00:36:12,980
you can ask your men to search

697
00:36:13,010 --> 00:36:14,200
all the rooms.

698
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:16,270
The case is the top priority.

699
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:18,590
I know what's important.

700
00:36:52,690 --> 00:36:54,280
Who wants to buy fresh Face Flowers?

701
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:12,690
This Tocharian woman

702
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:14,240
must be greedy for money

703
00:37:14,750 --> 00:37:15,920
so she seduced people with exotic poisonous flowers.

704
00:37:16,770 --> 00:37:17,680
But after she knew there was nowhere to escape,

705
00:37:18,210 --> 00:37:19,090
she committed suicide by taking poison.

706
00:37:20,530 --> 00:37:21,570
The culprit has been found,

707
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:22,930
but is dead.

708
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:23,770
Of course,

709
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:25,310
we need to find the antidote as soon as possible.

710
00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:27,940
But judging from the current situation,

711
00:37:28,860 --> 00:37:29,580
it seems that...

712
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:34,450
You mean

713
00:37:34,470 --> 00:37:36,250
the case can be closed?

714
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:37,990
I have no right to say that.

715
00:37:38,570 --> 00:37:40,140
It's just a statement of fact.

716
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:44,320
What do you think, Minister Xing?

717
00:37:45,580 --> 00:37:46,500
In order to solve this case,

718
00:37:46,910 --> 00:37:48,520
I've done my best.

719
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:50,300
Yes.

720
00:37:50,860 --> 00:37:51,940
Looks like this case

721
00:37:52,660 --> 00:37:54,260
can only be pushed this far.

722
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:57,220
But we can't spread any information,

723
00:37:57,380 --> 00:38:00,090
or Dongdu will be in chaos.

724
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:12,160
Prefectural Governor,

725
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:13,480
you...

726
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:14,940
What's wrong?

727
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:18,740
How is Administrator Su?

728
00:38:19,550 --> 00:38:22,970
It's said that he is as intelligent as Detective Di.

729
00:38:23,710 --> 00:38:24,430
But I think

730
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:25,950
it is an exaggeration.

731
00:38:27,210 --> 00:38:28,530
Once he got the news,

732
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:30,060
he lost the clue.

733
00:38:30,310 --> 00:38:31,230
He couldn't continue to investigate.

734
00:38:32,010 --> 00:38:34,790
But he refused to admit it.

735
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:37,810
There are only a few days left.

736
00:38:38,780 --> 00:38:40,820
Can he find the antidote?

737
00:38:40,820 --> 00:38:42,020
You mean...

738
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:46,170
Her Highness will be in danger.

739
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:50,300
Women are women.

740
00:38:50,390 --> 00:38:51,670
She wanted to be beautiful.

741
00:38:51,850 --> 00:38:53,430
But in the end,

742
00:38:53,460 --> 00:38:54,500
she destroyed herself.

743
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:56,810
Then...

744
00:38:57,660 --> 00:38:59,420
What's your plan, Prefectural Governor?

745
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:03,710
A wise man submits to fate.

746
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:07,330
The Princess and the Crown Prince

747
00:39:07,570 --> 00:39:10,260
are at odds now.

748
00:39:11,210 --> 00:39:12,460
If Her Highness

749
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:14,630
can't be cured,

750
00:39:15,170 --> 00:39:16,740
after His Highness ascends the throne,

751
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:19,750
he will investigate

752
00:39:19,780 --> 00:39:20,870
all us followers of Her Highness.

753
00:39:22,770 --> 00:39:25,550
So now there is only one way

754
00:39:25,570 --> 00:39:27,050
to protect ourselves.

755
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:30,290
Before Her Highness' face

756
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:31,930
turns into a skull,

757
00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:36,100
we need to go to His Highness for shelter.

758
00:39:37,970 --> 00:39:38,960
Xin.

759
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:40,580
What do you think?

760
00:39:42,660 --> 00:39:44,350
I was promoted by you.

761
00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:46,190
I'll listen to you.

762
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:53,100
If we keep investigating, there's no clue.

763
00:39:53,970 --> 00:39:54,870
If the case is closed,

764
00:39:55,940 --> 00:39:57,100
we can't explain to Her Highness.

765
00:39:58,780 --> 00:39:59,410
I think

766
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:01,020
Su Wuming

767
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:02,260
is in a dilemma.

768
00:40:03,730 --> 00:40:04,840
Did Lu Lingfeng

769
00:40:05,060 --> 00:40:06,210
spare no effort to help?

770
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:07,460
General Lu.

771
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:09,020
He...

772
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:10,980
Don't beat around the bush.

773
00:40:11,420 --> 00:40:12,300
He did his best.

774
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:13,880
But I think

775
00:40:14,610 --> 00:40:16,000
he hopes that Administrator Su

776
00:40:16,370 --> 00:40:17,060
can close the case.

777
00:40:20,180 --> 00:40:20,720
What about you?

778
00:40:21,940 --> 00:40:22,900
What's your opinion?

779
00:40:27,060 --> 00:40:28,960
I'm willing to pledge my loyalty to Your Highness.

780
00:40:29,490 --> 00:40:31,090
If you think the case should be closed,

781
00:40:31,620 --> 00:40:32,460
I will do as you say immediately

782
00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:33,360
and stop investigating.

783
00:40:33,570 --> 00:40:34,850
You're the Minister of Justice.

784
00:40:35,620 --> 00:40:36,890
You should find out the truth,

785
00:40:37,410 --> 00:40:38,150
and, more importantly,

786
00:40:38,180 --> 00:40:39,180
find the antidote for the Face Flowers.

787
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:41,290
Under such a circumstance, how can you close the case now?

788
00:40:41,540 --> 00:40:42,020
I...

789
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:50,400
Your Highness.

790
00:40:50,730 --> 00:40:51,630
Xin Huaishen is here.

791
00:40:54,310 --> 00:40:54,880
You may leave.

792
00:40:55,910 --> 00:40:57,560
You need to do your best to investigate this case.

793
00:40:57,910 --> 00:40:58,330
Yes.

794
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:02,110
Great General.

795
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:08,900
Greetings, Your Highness.

796
00:41:09,820 --> 00:41:10,680
Get up and answer me.

797
00:41:11,290 --> 00:41:11,760
Yes.

798
00:41:13,190 --> 00:41:13,990
How are things going?

799
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:15,930
The Princess trusts me.

800
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:17,810
She asked me to keep an eye on Gao Zhongyi.

801
00:41:18,140 --> 00:41:18,900
But she doesn't know

802
00:41:19,030 --> 00:41:20,890
the one I swore loyalty to

803
00:41:21,060 --> 00:41:22,580
is Your Highness.

804
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:23,810
You did not put your loyalty on me,

805
00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:25,260
but on Tang.

806
00:41:25,910 --> 00:41:27,660
Because of

807
00:41:27,690 --> 00:41:28,890
loyal and talented men like you,

808
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:30,460
our dynasty will be more promising.

809
00:41:30,820 --> 00:41:32,260
I'll keep it in mind.

810
00:41:34,180 --> 00:41:35,170
I have good news.

811
00:41:36,870 --> 00:41:38,150
Gao Zhongyi thinks

812
00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:39,860
it's hard for Su Wuming to solve the case,

813
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:41,670
and there's not much time left for Her Highness,

814
00:41:41,810 --> 00:41:44,210
so he decided to follow Your Highness.

815
00:41:46,260 --> 00:41:48,210
He doesn't know Your Highness is still in Luoyang.

816
00:41:49,010 --> 00:41:49,720
I think

817
00:41:49,970 --> 00:41:51,300
he will write a letter soon

818
00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:53,040
and send it to Chang'an.

819
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:55,620
Your Highness.

820
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:57,460
Gao Zhongyi wants to have it both ways.

821
00:41:57,940 --> 00:41:58,780
You can't rely on him.

822
00:41:59,990 --> 00:42:01,000
Great General, you're wise.

823
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:02,030
But

824
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:04,110
I have my own opinions.

825
00:42:05,020 --> 00:42:05,470
Go ahead.

826
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:09,340
Although Her Highness is dying,

827
00:42:09,700 --> 00:42:10,860
it's not

828
00:42:10,860 --> 00:42:12,070
the last moment yet.

829
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:14,990
If we can weaken her strength now,

830
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:16,680
when Your Highness ascends the throne,

831
00:42:16,860 --> 00:42:18,460
all the officials will say

832
00:42:18,910 --> 00:42:21,220
it's in line with people's aspiration.

833
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:23,620
Isn't that great?

834
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:25,260
I'm not in the mood.

835
00:42:26,330 --> 00:42:27,180
Is it so hard

836
00:42:28,130 --> 00:42:29,030
to solve this case?

837
00:42:30,940 --> 00:42:31,540
Won't my aunt

838
00:42:31,540 --> 00:42:32,700
be saved?

839
00:42:35,850 --> 00:42:38,190
I guess it's hopeless.

840
00:42:39,100 --> 00:42:40,020
However,

841
00:42:40,980 --> 00:42:42,300
it is not Your Highness

842
00:42:42,410 --> 00:42:43,950
who conspired the whole thing.

843
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:45,790
So you don't need to...

844
00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:51,660
I hope

845
00:42:51,660 --> 00:42:52,780
that Lu Lingfeng can help Su Wuming

846
00:42:54,340 --> 00:42:55,540
find the antidote

847
00:42:57,090 --> 00:42:58,220
before aunt dies.

♫Even if there are invisible waves♫

865
00:44:33,100 --> 00:44:35,090
♫I'll tell the story of the fate♫

866
00:44:37,180 --> 00:44:41,610
♫Tell the love of the world♫

867
00:44:42,900 --> 00:44:45,100
♫For the memory of grace♫

868
00:44:46,030 --> 00:44:48,400
♫And the resentment is not yet over♫

869
00:44:49,390 --> 00:44:54,830
♫The rivers and mountains are immortal, the clouds are overturned♫

870
00:44:55,760 --> 00:45:01,960
♫To be consoled by the truth, even with thorns on my back♫

871
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:06,680
♫Only for justice♫

872
00:45:08,650 --> 00:45:14,930
♫That I seek a truth for this long, lonely night♫

873
00:45:15,210 --> 00:45:21,100
♫The heaven and earth are held together by a strong will♫

874
00:45:22,140 --> 00:45:24,190
♫The people are in peace♫

875
00:45:24,220 --> 00:45:28,650
♫Carving right and wrong into a clear heart♫

876
00:45:29,380 --> 00:45:30,740
♫The truth♫

877
00:45:30,770 --> 00:45:34,500
♫Will reinterpret this justice♫

878
00:45:34,750 --> 00:45:40,860
♫Even if there are a thousand sails, it's not a waste of time♫

879
00:45:41,230 --> 00:45:47,420
♫What I am afraid of is the unrighted wrong♫

880
00:45:48,030 --> 00:45:49,950
♫What is the meaning of life and death?♫

881
00:45:50,170 --> 00:45:54,300
♫I'll paint the sunshine into the landscape♫

882
00:45:54,620 --> 00:45:56,340
♫The spirit of righteousness♫

883
00:45:56,490 --> 00:46:00,470
♫Exists for the one I care♫
