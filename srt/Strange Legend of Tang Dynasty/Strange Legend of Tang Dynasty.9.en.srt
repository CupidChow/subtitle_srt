4
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:49,880
No one is here.

5
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:52,660
No one is here?

6
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:55,120
Impossible.

7
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:56,950
Last night I stayed outside all night

8
00:01:57,370 --> 00:01:58,680
and I didn't notice anyone leaving.

9
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:05,790
What's that smell?

10
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:07,420
It smells so disgusting.

11
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:33,450
What's wrong?

12
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:34,750
Heads.

13
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:03,030
You killed them?

14
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:05,760
I know

15
00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:07,430
one of them.

16
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:09,380
It's Colonel Yu.

17
00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:11,400
Who is the other one?

18
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:14,660
He introduced himself

19
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:18,090
as Cui Wuji of Qinghe.

20
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:21,630
He came later than Colonel Yu.

21
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:24,280
He insisted on staying at Gantang Post.

22
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:27,020
Cui Wuji of Qinghe?

23
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:29,270
Why didn't I see this person before?

24
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,810
You were sleeping soundly.

25
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:34,160
Liu Shiba.

26
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:35,320
Let me ask you.

27
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:37,170
Is there an icehouse

28
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,380
in Gantang Post

29
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:40,530
with a lot of meat hanging there?

30
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:44,140
No.

31
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:45,020
Nonsense!

32
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:47,050
I went there last night.

33
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:48,260
I saw you

34
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:49,740
with a man in a red robe.

35
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:51,670
There is no icehouse

36
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:53,500
in this post.

37
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:54,970
How did you get there?

38
00:03:55,329 --> 00:03:57,880
Maybe you had hallucinations,

39
00:03:58,610 --> 00:04:01,330
or maybe you were dreaming.

40
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:03,650
People who live in Gantang Post

41
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:05,430
are often like this.

42
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:06,680
Hallucinations?

43
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:07,930
What do you mean?

44
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:10,310
Nothing.

45
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:14,360
When I close my eyes,

46
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:17,060
I often imagine

47
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:18,870
that I have passed the imperial examination

48
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:22,530
and have got an official position.

49
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:25,480
Liu Shiba! How dare you!

50
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,400
How dare you be so arrogant after killing people?

51
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:28,660
Take him back to the county.

52
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:29,360
Yes, sir.

53
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:30,050
Wait.

54
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:33,020
Miss Pei and Xue Huan

55
00:04:33,530 --> 00:04:34,820
stayed in the left superior room all night,

56
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:36,650
and they didn't hear anything.

57
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:38,540
How did you kill them?

58
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,790
I just drugged them with the incense

59
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:45,580
and cut off their heads.

60
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:47,880
What else do you want to hear?

61
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:50,180
There are only two heads in the pot.

62
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:51,380
Where are the others?

63
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:51,940
Also,

64
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:54,440
where are the bodies

65
00:04:54,659 --> 00:04:56,150
of Colonel Yu and Cui Wuji?

66
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:01,100
Why don't you ask me the reason

67
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:03,720
why I killed them first?

68
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,550
Why?

69
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:08,410
Because they killed my Bai.

70
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:10,820
Who is Bai?

71
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:17,290
Could it be that white python?

72
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:19,610
How did you know that?

73
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:21,860
It was me

74
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:23,230
who killed the white python.

75
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,270
What?

76
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:33,830
I kindly didn't kill

77
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:35,460
you and Su Wuming.

78
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:36,870
Why did you kill

79
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:38,590
my Bai?

80
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:42,020
Your white python tried to harm me.

81
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:43,820
If I didn't kill it,

82
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:45,420
I'd lose my own life.

83
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:47,870
Looks like you're the one who deserves to die.

84
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:48,680
Lu Lingfeng,

85
00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:51,530
you'll die in your boots.

86
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:52,670
You murderer!

87
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:53,850
How dare you talk nonsense?

88
00:05:54,010 --> 00:05:54,980
Is there any law?

89
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,200
The bodies of those two men

90
00:05:56,430 --> 00:05:57,190
and the others,

91
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,070
where are they?

92
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:05,940
My snakes ate them.

93
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:06,580
Nonsense!

94
00:06:07,170 --> 00:06:08,400
How many snakes do you have

95
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:09,600
to eat so many people?

96
00:06:11,530 --> 00:06:12,720
Do you want to have a look?

97
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:16,740
Tell them to let me go.

98
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:20,890
Let him go!

99
00:07:03,730 --> 00:07:04,650
Wait, General Lu.

100
00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:08,000
These pythons are spiritual,

101
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:09,310
and they are innocent.

102
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:10,770
Let them go.

103
00:07:11,570 --> 00:07:12,210
Lu Lingfeng.

104
00:07:14,130 --> 00:07:15,810
Miss Xijun is right.

105
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:17,620
Maybe the Gantang Post

106
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:19,460
used to belong to them.

107
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:22,470
Let's retreat first.

108
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:42,540
Lu Lingfeng.

109
00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:43,850
What are you doing?

110
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:45,480
I'll burn this place

111
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:46,840
with a fire.

112
00:07:47,570 --> 00:07:48,090
-No. -No.

113
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,650
There are still many unsolved mysteries in this case,

114
00:07:56,210 --> 00:07:58,070
if you burn this place down,

115
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,730
I'm afraid we'll never be able to solve them.

116
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:05,620
Sheriff Su, what's your opinion?

117
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:07,940
In my opnion,

118
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:09,400
although this is an abandoned post,

119
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:11,240
it's still the government's place.

120
00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:12,900
If you burn them with a fire,

121
00:08:13,230 --> 00:08:14,240
I can't justify your action.

122
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:16,400
How about this?

123
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:18,270
Give Liu Shiba to me.

124
00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:20,330
I will find out the truth of this case

125
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:21,460
and punish the murderer severely.

126
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,590
There must be more than

127
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:25,330
these victims.

128
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,950
What I know is

129
00:08:27,970 --> 00:08:29,460
that a wandering monk

130
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:31,370
died here not long ago.

131
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:32,580
I thought

132
00:08:32,909 --> 00:08:34,049
that Colonel Yu

133
00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:35,320
was a villain.

134
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:37,990
I didn't expect

135
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:40,890
you were so evil.

136
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:45,640
Sheriff Su,

137
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:47,770
I'll leave this to you.

138
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:48,940
Commander Su,

139
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:52,070
I wish you a safe,

140
00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:53,810
risk-free journey to the south.

141
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:55,040
Goodbye.

142
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:05,440
Sir,

143
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:07,940
please promise me.

144
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:09,460
Hey,

145
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,440
you are quite greedy.

146
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:14,220
You can just drive her back to Chang'an.

147
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:15,740
Why do you need another horse?

148
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:17,540
My lady asked me to do so.

149
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:18,470
What does it have to do with you?

150
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:24,690
Lu Lingfeng.

151
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:26,110
Now there are more people.

152
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,240
Miss Xijun is going to

153
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:30,350
go south with us.

154
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:33,900
Su Wuming.

155
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:35,060
I don't think it's a good idea.

156
00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:38,730
Why not?

157
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:42,480
It's me who invited Miss Xijun

158
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,330
to Nanzhou for a trip.

159
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:45,310
You

160
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:47,950
are just my personal staff.

161
00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:49,850
Do I need your opinion

162
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:52,580
on what I've decided?

163
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,800
But Miss Xijun,

164
00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:02,330
we need to walk to Nanzhou.

165
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:03,470
You may suffer a little

166
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:05,080
on the way.

167
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:06,510
There are horses and a carriage,

168
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:08,300
why do you walk there?

169
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:10,660
Speaking of this,

170
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:12,860
it has something to do with your father.

171
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:16,260
Her Highness asked me to tell you

172
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:18,820
that you didn't need to ride a horse

173
00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:20,170
or take a carriage to the south.

174
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:22,100
You could just walk there.

175
00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:24,910
You could think about it on the way.

176
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:27,160

00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:11,240
I didn't ask Governor Xiong for money.

349
00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:13,050
I just told him

350
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:14,950
the identity of you

351
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:15,680
and Lu Lingfeng.

352
00:17:15,859 --> 00:17:16,609
They were willing to

353
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,280
treat me so well.

354
00:17:18,410 --> 00:17:19,819
What could I do?

355
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:21,790
Don't think too much.

356
00:17:22,119 --> 00:17:23,849
Nanzhou is remote.

357
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:26,680
Few people come from the capital.

358
00:17:27,099 --> 00:17:28,250
As long as they come,

359
00:17:28,870 --> 00:17:30,960
I'll treat them like this.

360
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:33,880
Thank you for your hospitality.

361
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:36,810
I apologize on their behalf.

362
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:38,170
Let's drink.

363
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:40,110
Let's drink together.

364
00:17:40,650 --> 00:17:41,840
The wine in the Wangbing Restaurant

365
00:17:41,910 --> 00:17:43,230
is fragrant and tasty

366
00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:44,780
with endless taste.

367
00:17:44,950 --> 00:17:46,090
It would be a pity

368
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:47,800
not to drink it, right?

369
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:49,140
Lu.

370
00:17:57,150 --> 00:17:58,420
Su, Lu.

371
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:00,670
You must have eaten

372
00:18:00,690 --> 00:18:01,970
countless delicacies in the capital.

373
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:03,860
-But this dish… -Thank you.

374
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:05,820
is a specialty in Nanzhou.

375
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:08,190
It has a very nice name,

376
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:08,920
which is called...

377
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:11,740
The Young and the Old Together

378
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,410
is actually stewed chicken with tender bamboo shoots.

379
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:17,010
I, Chicken Fed,

380
00:18:17,290 --> 00:18:19,770
have eated all kinds of chicken in the world.

381
00:18:20,130 --> 00:18:22,290
This is the best way to cook.

382
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:24,110
I've been eating it for so long,

383
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:25,750
but I'm still not tired of it.

384
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,730
Don't just eat by yourself.

385
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:31,340
Miss Xijun in Commander's Residence

386
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:32,370
and Xue Huan, who drove all the way

387
00:18:32,370 --> 00:18:33,860
are still starving.

388
00:18:34,130 --> 00:18:34,540
Who?

389
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:36,320
Xijun?

390
00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:38,170
The daughter of Pei Jian?

391
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:40,720
She also came here with you?

392
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:44,150
I didn't know about this.

393
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:46,310
Please rest assured, Lu.

394
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:47,520
I asked them to cook another

395
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:49,180
the Young and the Old Together

396
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:51,950
before the feast.

397
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:54,050
I've already sent it to Commander's Residence.

398
00:18:58,420 --> 00:18:59,590
Prefectural Governor Xiong is so considerate.

399
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:01,330
He even sent someone to deliver delicious food here.

400
00:19:01,570 --> 00:19:02,510
I heard that this was the most famous dish

401
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:03,310
in Nanzhou.

402
00:19:03,610 --> 00:19:05,300
It's called the Young and the Old Together.

403
00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:09,630
Miss,

404
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:10,770
please have a taste.

405
00:19:12,730 --> 00:19:13,320
Xue Huan.

406
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:14,610
Does this painting look like them?

407
00:19:15,310 --> 00:19:15,740
Yes.

408
00:19:16,050 --> 00:19:16,930
It really looks like them.

409
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:17,910
I named this painting

410
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:19,420
the Young and the Old Together as well.

411
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:20,910
I hope everything goes well with Mr Su and General Lu

412
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:22,090
in Nanzhou.

413
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:23,350
My lady,

414
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:24,980
you refused the prefectural governor's feast

415
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,460
just to draw this?

416
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:28,420
Not exactly.

417
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,750
I also wanted to accompany you.

418
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:31,490
Accompany me?

419
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:33,580
You took the risk to take me out of Chang'an

420
00:19:33,650 --> 00:19:35,220
and had such a long journey.

421
00:19:35,610 --> 00:19:37,200
Of course I have to

422
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:38,150
eat the first meal in Nanzhou

423
00:19:38,170 --> 00:19:38,810
with you.

424
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:40,670
I also wanted to express my gratitude.

425
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:41,740
Don't say that.

426
00:19:41,970 --> 00:19:42,670
On the way,

427
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:43,610
I've broadened my horizon.

428
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:44,920
Mr Su is knowledgeable.

429
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:45,900
General Lu is loyal and courageous.

430
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:47,180
It's my pleasure

431
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:48,570
to stay with them.

432
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:50,340
I should thank you, Miss.

433
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:52,110
You didn't like Lu Lingfeng before,

434
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:53,100
did you?

435
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:54,490
I just couldn't stand

436
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:55,600
his arrogance,

437
00:19:55,930 --> 00:19:57,010
especially

438
00:19:57,220 --> 00:19:58,270
when he ignores you.

439
00:19:59,310 --> 00:20:01,530
Anyway,

440
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:03,580
he's quite somebody.

441
00:20:03,850 --> 00:20:05,000
Although he was injured,

442
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:07,070
the villains at Gantang Post

443
00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:08,570
were no match for him.

444
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:09,430
If only I could have

445
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:10,700
his powerful martial arts.

446
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:11,680
I would definitely beat Colonel Yu

447
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:12,520
to the ground.

448
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:13,460
How could I let him

449
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:14,820
make things difficult for my lady.

450
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:16,860
If you want to learn martial arts,

451
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,020
you can ask him to be your master.

452
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:20,940
Master?

453
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,380
Didn't I mention it before?

454
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,430
But the Lu family of Fan Yang is arrogant.

455
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:26,720
How could he accept me?

456
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:28,700
You are also a descendant of a noble family.

457
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:29,950
Your ancestor, Xue Rengui,

458
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:31,060
was a great man.

459
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:34,610
But you need to give him a gift.

460
00:20:36,010 --> 00:20:36,910
A gift?

461
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:38,940
I have no money.

462
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:41,700
I'll prepare the gift for you.

463
00:20:42,570 --> 00:20:43,480
Please.

464
00:20:45,890 --> 00:20:46,770
Prefectural Governor,

465
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:49,900
I have an old friend in Nanzhou.

466
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:52,890
I haven't seen him for more than ten years. I miss him so much.

467
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:54,740
He's a calligrapher

468
00:20:54,870 --> 00:20:55,990
called Yan Yuanfu.

469
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:58,030
Do you know him?

470
00:21:26,090 --> 00:21:27,570
Whose funeral is this?

471
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:29,210
Even the funeral music

472
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:30,850
is so beautiful.

473
00:21:31,050 --> 00:21:31,980
Commander Su.

474
00:21:32,230 --> 00:21:33,960
If I'm not mistaken,

475
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:37,580
the person whom the funeral music is playing for

476
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:42,090
is your old friend, Yan Yuanfu.

477
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:44,160
What did you say?

478
00:21:54,370 --> 00:21:56,920
Seven days ago, Yan Yuanfu died of illness.

479
00:21:57,450 --> 00:21:59,610
Now, the rest three

480

of the Nanzhou Four Scholars

481
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:02,790
are mourning for him.

482
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:04,540
I didn't expect that.

483
00:22:05,410 --> 00:22:06,690
The Nanzhou Four Scholars.

484
00:22:08,690 --> 00:22:10,790
The one holding the coffin is the tea ceremony master.

Zhong Boqi.

487
00:22:12,130 --> 00:22:13,510
Not to mention in Nanzhou,

488
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:15,430
wherever there is tea,

489
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:17,950
the person who is most proficient in the tea ceremony

490
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:19,540
is this man.

491
00:22:19,970 --> 00:22:21,030

00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:24,590
[Lu Gongfu,  one of the Nanzhou Four Scholars]

is Lu Gongfu, the master of guqin.

494
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:25,930
His guqin of the Three Kingdoms Period

495
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:28,440
has extraordinary string sounds.

496
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:31,300
It is said that

497
00:22:31,410 --> 00:22:33,730
he often leads the birds to sing together when he plays in the mountains.

498
00:22:33,930 --> 00:22:35,480
And even the sound of the stream

499
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,130
can match his string sounds.

500
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:41,950
The one scattering paper money is the poet, Leng Ji.

501

[Leng Ji, one of the Nanzhou Four Scholars]

are recited by all women and children in Nanzhou.

504

are known as the Nanzhou Four Scholars.

Prefectural Governor Xiong,

508
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:00,370
I want to go down

509

to see my old friend off.

510
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,520

Disciple?

518
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:24,710
It's too reckless

519
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:25,660
at this time.

520
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:27,510
How could you do this?

521
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:29,600
What are you doing?

522
00:23:30,690 --> 00:23:31,100
You

523
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:32,460
You should think about the timing.

524
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:33,370
Mr. Zhong,

525
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:34,580
I sincerely want to

526
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:35,920
be Mr. Lu's disciple.

527
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:37,810
Sir,

528
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:39,610
this is the ninth time I beg you.

529
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:41,250
Please accept me.

530
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,000
This is ridiculous.

531
00:23:43,490 --> 00:23:44,090
Sir,

532
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:46,450
I know you are alone.

533
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:47,620
If you have me as your disciple,

534
00:23:47,890 --> 00:23:49,050
I would be your son.

535
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:51,100
I'm willing to take care of you.

536
00:23:51,250 --> 00:23:51,830
Bastard!

537
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:52,820
Guards!

538
00:23:52,930 --> 00:23:54,130
Drive him away!

539
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:55,580
Let go of me!

540
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:56,980
I want to follow Mr. Lu.

541
00:23:57,250 --> 00:23:57,890
Sir,

542
00:23:58,180 --> 00:23:59,940
why don't you take me as your disciple?

543
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:00,540
Is it because

544
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:02,020
I played guqin in the brothel?

545
00:24:02,530 --> 00:24:04,460
Sir, you are a famous scholar.

546
00:24:04,550 --> 00:24:05,540
You are open-minded.

547
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:07,050
How can you dislike me?

548
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:09,060
No one in Nanzhou

549
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:10,190
is more suitable than me

550
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:11,780
to be your disciple.

551
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:12,940
If you don't accept me,

552
00:24:13,610 --> 00:24:14,450
your skills

553
00:24:14,490 --> 00:24:16,620
will go extinct very soon.

554
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:17,270
Sir.

555
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:20,230
Let him go!

556
00:24:22,450 --> 00:24:23,060
Sir,

557
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:25,900
do you agree?

558
00:24:26,230 --> 00:24:26,910
You asked me

559
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:28,290
why I didn't accept you.

560
00:24:28,870 --> 00:24:29,300
Fine.

561
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:31,370
I'll tell you

562
00:24:31,570 --> 00:24:32,420
in front of the people of Nanzhou.

563
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:33,070
It is not because

564
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:34,450
you played guqin in the brothel.

565
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:36,950
Even if you are the Emperor's musician,

566
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:38,120
I

567
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:40,250
will not take you as my disciple.

568
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:42,390
It's because I've seen your performance.

569
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:44,460
You're just someone

570
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:45,500
who can pluck strings.

571
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:47,060
You're not gifted at all.

572
00:24:49,130 --> 00:24:50,210
My skills

573
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:52,290
may go extinct.

574
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:54,670
But an ordinary person like you

575
00:24:54,930 --> 00:24:55,810
don't deserve my teaching.

576
00:24:56,010 --> 00:24:57,500
Just give up.

577
00:24:57,660 --> 00:24:59,110
Mr. Lu has made it clear.

578
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:00,370
Get out of the way.

579
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:01,290
That's right.

580
00:25:01,490 --> 00:25:02,550
If you want to learn from a famous guqin master,

581
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:03,560
why don't you evaluate yourself first?

582
00:25:03,590 --> 00:25:04,590
You are not made for that at all.

583
00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:06,300
And you even dare to stop the funeral team?

584
00:25:06,410 --> 00:25:08,000
This is disrespectful to Mr. Yan.

585
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:09,190
Get out of here.

586
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:11,560
Yes, get out.

587
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:12,780
Be quick!

588
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:13,530
Go away!

589
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:15,100
Go away!

590
00:25:15,310 --> 00:25:15,950
That's ridiculous.

591
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:16,840
Exactly. Go away!

592
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:18,190
Leave now.

593
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:19,330
Ungraceful!

594
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:19,960
Get out of here!

595
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:21,220
Hurry up!

596
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:22,300
Go!

597
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:23,420
This is ridiculous.

598
00:25:26,490 --> 00:25:27,470
Lu Gongfu,

599
00:25:28,790 --> 00:25:30,480
it is your right to refuse me,

600
00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:33,710
but why should you humiliate me?

601
00:25:34,730 --> 00:25:35,820
Wait and see.

602
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:37,430
I, Lin Bao,

603
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:39,610
will take revenge.

604
00:25:56,290 --> 00:25:58,260
Greetings, Governor Xiong, Administrator Luo.

605
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:00,500
Mr. Yan died.

606
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:02,790
I was so sad.

607
00:26:03,330 --> 00:26:06,500
What a great man.

608
00:26:07,270 --> 00:26:10,230
My condolences to you all.

609
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:13,400
Let me introduce.

610
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:16,060
This is Commander Su.

611
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:18,570
Su Wuming.

612
00:26:19,330 --> 00:26:20,980
It's my honor to meet you.

613
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:23,650
Greetings, Commander Su.

614
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:25,160
I'm Leng Ji, a poet.

615
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:30,570
You may not know,

616
00:26:31,170 --> 00:26:32,890
Mr. Yan

617
00:26:33,030 --> 00:26:35,490
was my old friend in Chang'an.

618
00:26:36,290 --> 00:26:38,310
I came to Nanzhou this time

619
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:41,510
to visit him and catch up with him.

620
00:26:43,010 --> 00:26:43,930
But I didn't expect

621
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:48,470
this would be the last time I saw him.

622
00:26:49,930 --> 00:26:51,730
Brother Yuanfu,

623
00:26:54,030 --> 00:26:57,130
rest in peace.

624
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:10,010
Brother Yuanfu.

625
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:26,520
These four famous scholars from Nanzhou

626
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:27,700
have known each other for years.

627
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:28,970
They're like brothers.

628
00:27:29,620 --> 00:27:31,530
Yan Yuanfu once proudly

629
00:27:31,550 --> 00:27:32,540
told me

630
00:27:32,850 --> 00:27:34,690
the reason why he left Chang'an and went back to Nanzhou

631
00:27:34,970 --> 00:27:36,710
was that Nanzhou Four Scholars

632
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:38,940
were in the same boat and indispensable to each other.

633
00:27:40,110 --> 00:27:40,580
By the way,

634
00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:42,100
someone

635
00:27:42,530 --> 00:27:44,480
drew a painting of them.

636
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:45,180
It's called

637
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:47,000
The Stone Bridge.

638
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:49,030
The Stone Bridge.

639
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:50,440
This painting

640
00:27:50,810 --> 00:27:52,400
is now a collection of Ouyang Quan,

641
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:53,660
the owner of this inn.

642
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:54,870
Ouyang Quan

643
00:27:54,990 --> 00:27:55,830
is a follower

644
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:56,460
of these scholars.

645
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:57,830
He wants to join them.

646
00:27:58,500 --> 00:27:59,400
Why didn't he come out

647
00:27:59,430 --> 00:28:00,320
to see Yan Yuanfu off?

648
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:03,140
Mr. Yan.

649
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:05,460
today

650
00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:09,080
you shall rest in peace.

651
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:11,160
I'm Ouyang Quan.

652
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:13,510
I didn't dare to see you off.

653
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:16,340
I'm afraid Mr. Lu and Mr. Leng

654
00:29:16,370 --> 00:29:18,540
would be unhappy with me.

655
00:29:18,870 --> 00:29:21,010
They may despise that my identity as a businessman

656
00:29:21,810 --> 00:29:23,980
is not good enough for you four.

657
00:29:24,730 --> 00:29:25,710
But I have always considered you

658
00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:29,650
as my confidant.

659
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:32,180
What's more, I want to join you

660
00:29:32,650 --> 00:29:33,530
and rank myself

661
00:29:33,550 --> 00:29:35,290
in the famous Four Scholars

662
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:38,900
to become the fifth.

663
00:29:40,210 --> 00:29:43,340
Now that you are gone,

664
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:46,480
my wish

665
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:51,780
can never be fulfilled.

666
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:57,120
Mr. Yan,

667
00:29:57,420 --> 00:30:01,490
please accept Ouyang Quan's bow.

668
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:05,810
Master.

669
00:30:06,410 --> 00:30:07,240
Lu Li is here again.

670
00:30:07,930 --> 00:30:09,380
He's very sincere this time.

671
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:12,640
I told you.

672
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:14,350
If he comes to me again, tell him I'm not here.

673
00:30:14,790 --> 00:30:16,710
Tell him not to bother me again.

674
00:30:17,070 --> 00:30:18,400
But the price he offers this time

675
00:30:18,430 --> 00:30:18,970
is indeed...

676
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:19,470
Shut up.

677
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:21,720
No matter how high the price is,

678
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:23,520
I won't sell the Stone Bridge.

679
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:28,070
[Ouyang's Residence]

680
00:30:30,250 --> 00:30:30,820
Here he is.

681
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:33,130
How is it?

682
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:35,390
Is the price okay this time?

683
00:30:35,910 --> 00:30:36,960
I can't help you.

684
00:30:38,270 --> 00:30:39,200
And I can't accept

685
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:41,110
your tip.

686
00:30:41,670 --> 00:30:42,440
Take it back.

687
00:30:43,850 --> 00:30:44,540
You...

688
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:45,560
You...

689
00:30:47,690 --> 00:30:49,300
There are plenty of antiques and paintings

690
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:50,550
in our shop.

691
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:51,540
In my opinion,

692
00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:52,780
the Stone Bridge...

693
00:30:52,850 --> 00:30:53,810
How ignorant you are!

694
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:55,950
Now Zhang Xuan has gained a great reputation

695
00:30:55,980 --> 00:30:57,500
in Chang'an.

696
00:30:57,930 --> 00:30:58,840
This painting

697
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:00,770
is already valuable.

698
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:01,440
Remember, compared with the Stone Bridge,

699
00:31:01,950 --> 00:31:03,310
those things in our shop

700
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:04,700
are not worth mentioning.

701
00:31:04,930 --> 00:31:05,880
There is only "one and a half" treasure

702
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:08,340
in Nanzhou.

703
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:09,260
"One" means

704
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:10,660
the Stone Bridge

705
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:11,360
owned by Ouyang Quan.

706
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:12,880
The "half" means

707
00:31:13,350 --> 00:31:14,770
the guqin in the Three Kingdoms Period

708
00:31:14,970 --> 00:31:16,210
of Lu Gongfu.

709
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:18,060
Why...

710
00:31:18,310 --> 00:31:20,380
Why is the guqin called "the half"?

711
00:31:20,850 --> 00:31:22,360
That guqin and Lu Gongfu

712
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:23,640
complement each other.

713
00:31:24,050 --> 00:31:25,510
Even if others get it,

714
00:31:25,770 --> 00:31:26,580
they can't play as well as

715
00:31:26,610 --> 00:31:28,320
Lu Gongfu.

716
00:31:28,930 --> 00:31:29,770
That's why

717
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:32,370
it only accounts for "a half treasure".

718
00:31:32,850 --> 00:31:33,450
What do you think?

719
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:35,240
The Commander's residence is luxurious enough, right?

720
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:36,970
In the future,

721
00:31:37,030 --> 00:31:38,840
no matter where you get promoted,

722
00:31:39,090 --> 00:31:40,960
or demoted,

723
00:31:41,420 --> 00:31:42,790
you can always hire me

724
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:44,050
to be your vanguard.

725
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:46,420
I'll do my best

726
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:47,670
and won't let you down.

727
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:49,750
Just like this time in Nanzhou.

728
00:31:53,710 --> 00:31:54,260
Su Wuming.

729
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:56,540
Go check your study room.

730
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:57,660
Miss Xijun

731
00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:59,940
prepared a special gift for you.

732
00:32:08,490 --> 00:32:10,250
Although it's only the back,

733
00:32:10,870 --> 00:32:13,630
I can recognize we two at first sight.

734
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:15,920
This is what happened yesterday.

735
00:32:16,850 --> 00:32:18,350
She drew it so real.

736
00:32:18,810 --> 00:32:22,050
If it weren't for her artistic skills,

737
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:25,740
I wouldn't have

738
00:32:26,030 --> 00:32:27,590
realized

739
00:32:27,620 --> 00:32:29,460
that the man she fell in love with

740
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:31,560
was not Mr. Xiao,

741
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:33,500
but you, General.

742
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:35,980
Su Wuming.

743
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:37,480
Don't mention it again.

744
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:38,710
Okay.

745
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:39,170
Also,

746
00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:40,940
Governor Xiong has promised

747
00:32:41,170 --> 00:32:42,780
to escort Miss Xijun back to the north.

748
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:44,690
Go and persuade her to return to Chang'an as soon as possible.

749
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:46,880
It is not appropriate for her

750
00:32:47,150 --> 00:32:48,240
to stay here.

751
00:32:48,690 --> 00:32:49,950
We are from the capital.

752
00:32:51,170 --> 00:32:51,990
The officials here

753
00:32:52,210 --> 00:32:53,760
have their reason to despise us.

754
00:32:53,950 --> 00:32:55,140
But if rumors

755
00:32:55,180 --> 00:32:55,990
were spread to Chang'an,

756
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:58,200
Miss Xijun's reputation would be ruined.

757
00:32:58,620 --> 00:32:59,120
Calm down.

758
00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:01,650
I'll keep it in mind.

759
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:03,520
Sir.

760
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:06,660
Miss Xijun.

761
00:33:07,610 --> 00:33:08,490
I wonder

762
00:33:08,730 --> 00:33:09,930
whether you like this painting?

763
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:11,750
Yes. I really like it.

764
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:14,700
General Lu, you've had a long journey.

765
00:33:15,170 --> 00:33:17,060
Xue Huan and I prepared some gifts.

766
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:24,220
General Lu, please take a look.

767
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:29,000
I saw General Lu

768
00:33:29,330 --> 00:33:30,870
didn't have a sword along the way.

769
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:32,650
I think you must be in a hurry

770
00:33:32,690 --> 00:33:33,450
when you left Chang'an.

771
00:33:33,870 --> 00:33:34,970
So I chose this sword for you.

772
00:33:35,670 --> 00:33:37,000
It is legendary.

773
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:38,810
It was left by the first Colonel

774
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:40,200
who was sent to Nanzhou

775
00:33:40,230 --> 00:33:40,780
for training.

776
00:33:41,290 --> 00:33:41,960
I wonder if it is good enough

777
00:33:42,390 --> 00:33:43,930
for General Lu.

778
00:33:47,450 --> 00:33:48,330
I won't accept any reward without contributions.

779
00:33:49,590 --> 00:33:50,280
Lu Lingfeng,

780
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:52,660
even if you don't accept

781
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:54,260
Miss Xijun's gift,

782
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:55,300
you need to have

783
00:33:55,340 --> 00:33:56,970
a proper reason.

784
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:58,680
Think about it.

785
00:33:58,860 --> 00:34:01,140
You've been driving the cart for Miss Xijun

786
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:03,620
all the way down to the south.

787
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:05,130
You have made great contributions.

788
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:10,130
Miss Xijun,

789
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:12,480
do I have any gift?

790
00:34:14,780 --> 00:34:16,100
Mr. Fed, right?

791
00:34:16,810 --> 00:34:18,760
You can call me Master Fed.

792
00:34:19,420 --> 00:34:20,070
Master Fed.

793
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:22,690
Although we met before,

794
00:34:22,909 --> 00:34:24,150
we weren't that familiar.

795
00:34:24,570 --> 00:34:26,050
Now that both of us live in the Commander's Residence,

796
00:34:26,150 --> 00:34:27,179
we are family now.

797
00:34:28,699 --> 00:34:29,909
When I get to know you well,

798
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:31,480
I will choose a gift

799
00:34:31,510 --> 00:34:33,190
specifically for you.

800
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:35,420
Look.

801
00:34:35,719 --> 00:34:36,139
Look.

802
00:34:36,350 --> 00:34:38,070
Even if I haven't got the gift yet,

803
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:39,590
I am happy with

804
00:34:40,060 --> 00:34:41,560
what Miss Xijun said.

805
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:43,980
Lu Lingfeng.

806
00:34:44,790 --> 00:34:46,250
Miss Xijun is nice.

807
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:47,560
Why don't you

808
00:34:48,219 --> 00:34:50,070
marry her?

809
00:34:50,290 --> 00:34:51,080
I'll handle your marriage.

810
00:34:51,620 --> 00:34:53,610
I'll entertain all the officials in Nanzhou

811
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,010
and famous merchants,

812
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:57,540
which can make a lot of money.

813
00:34:57,570 --> 00:34:58,000
Shut up!

814
00:34:58,540 --> 00:34:59,620
If you dare to talk nonsense again,

815
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:00,940
I'll kick you out.

816
00:35:01,630 --> 00:35:02,790
Kick me out?

817
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:04,790
You're daydreaming.

818
00:35:05,310 --> 00:35:06,260
Unless you die,

819
00:35:06,670 --> 00:35:07,440
or I die,

820
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:08,110
otherwise, you should keep your promise

821
00:35:08,130 --> 00:35:09,860
of a chicken every day.

822
00:35:10,110 --> 00:35:11,210
You are from the Lu family of Fanyang.

823
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:12,800
You can't go back on your word.

824
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:14,010
Master Fed,

825
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:16,080
General Lu is busy with work.

826
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:17,420
There will be flaws.

827
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:19,710
If he promised you anything before,

828
00:35:19,970 --> 00:35:21,640
I'll keep it for him from now on.

829
00:35:22,450 --> 00:35:23,610
Why do you

830
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:25,430
threaten him

831
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:26,330
with the reputation of the Lu Family?

832
00:35:28,030 --> 00:35:28,620
So...

833
00:35:29,030 --> 00:35:29,890
Then...

834
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:31,830
I was wrong.

835
00:35:31,970 --> 00:35:33,570
It looks like

836
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:36,210
that the only person that can discipline Master Fed

837
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:39,200
is you, Miss Xijun.

838
00:36:10,940 --> 00:36:12,040
Who's there? Come out.

839
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:19,660
Why are you

840
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:20,370
hiding there?

841
00:36:24,010 --> 00:36:24,770
I'm asking you.

842
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:26,220
What are you doing here?

843
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:28,280
To learn.

844
00:36:29,180 --> 00:36:29,850
What did you say?

845
00:36:30,450 --> 00:36:31,180
To learn martial arts.

846
00:36:32,290 --> 00:36:33,580
Didn't you say I was not qualified

847
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:34,240
to be your master?

848
00:36:34,910 --> 00:36:35,940
Why are you learning secretly here?

849
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:39,420
We live in the residence together.

850
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:41,140
There is no master

851
00:36:41,170 --> 00:36:42,270
better than you.

852
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:45,060
It turns out that I was used to make do with.

853
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:46,380
Not exactly.

854
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:47,710
You are

855
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:48,490
too arrogant,

856
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:49,860
unlike the master in my mind.

857
00:36:51,270 --> 00:36:52,520
But you're good at martial arts.

858
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:56,130
Do you really want to learn martial arts?

859
00:36:56,410 --> 00:36:57,040
Yes.

860
00:36:57,500 --> 00:36:58,940
You want to be like your ancestor, Xue Renhui,

861
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:00,020
to make great achievements?

862
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:01,520
I told you that day.

863
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:03,780
Miss Xijun coaxed me

864
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:05,640
that Xue Rengui was my ancestor.

865
00:37:06,270 --> 00:37:07,070
I want to learn martial arts

866
00:37:07,170 --> 00:37:08,600
because I want to protect Miss Xijun.

867
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:11,120
You are loyal

868
00:37:11,190 --> 00:37:12,170
to your master.

869
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:14,520
But if you have no ambition,

870
00:37:15,190 --> 00:37:16,950
how can you be my disciple?

871
00:37:18,090 --> 00:37:19,050
Some may be ambitious,

872
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:20,360
but they may also achieve nothing for a lifetime.

873
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:21,890
But if someone can adjust himself to any environment,

874
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:22,870
and can do what's the most important

875
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:23,580
at the moment,

876
00:37:23,780 --> 00:37:24,910
he will be the greatest one.

877
00:37:27,370 --> 00:37:30,040
You seem to imply something.

878
00:37:30,890 --> 00:37:31,700
I am talking about you!

879
00:37:32,610 --> 00:37:33,350
You are no longer

880
00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:34,220
the General of the Imperial Guards now.

881
00:37:34,390 --> 00:37:35,270
What's the use of thinking about His Majesty,

882
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:36,730
the Eastern Palace

883
00:37:36,940 --> 00:37:37,700
or the Zhuque Avenue?

884
00:37:38,070 --> 00:37:38,910
You're in Nanzhou now,

885
00:37:39,450 --> 00:37:40,880
but you say this is a barbarian place.

886
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:42,620
The Prefectural Governor and Administrator

887
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:43,780
respect you very much.

888
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,150
But you still look down on them.

889
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:46,620
Have you forgotten

890
00:37:46,940 --> 00:37:48,360
that you're Mr. Su's staff?

891
00:37:48,830 --> 00:37:49,920
If you lose your job,

892
00:37:50,420 --> 00:37:51,360
what's the point of

893
00:37:51,380 --> 00:37:52,100
those ambitions?

894
00:37:54,330 --> 00:37:55,770
Did Pei Xijun teach you that?

895
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:56,550
No.

896
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:57,470
Liar.

897
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:00,000
How could a lowly servant

898
00:38:00,430 --> 00:38:01,870
say grand things like that?

899
00:38:04,970 --> 00:38:05,970
You underestimate others again.

900
00:38:06,230 --> 00:38:07,550
Mr. Su has taught me

901
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:08,610
so many principles in books.

902
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:09,940
I learn it by heart.

903
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:22,040
Do you really want to be my disciple?

904
00:38:22,620 --> 00:38:23,020
Yes.

905
00:38:23,740 --> 00:38:25,140
Don't you think I'm a sinner?

906
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:25,700
No.

907
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:26,620
Okay.

908
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:28,650
From now on,

909
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:30,030
at this time every day,

910
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:31,770
I will teach you martial art here.

911
00:38:32,260 --> 00:38:32,560
Yes.

912
00:38:33,110 --> 00:38:33,850
Master,

913
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:35,500
please accept my bow.

914
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:41,350
Brother Su,

915
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:43,530
you must be tired after the long journey.

916
00:38:44,110 --> 00:38:45,040
Didn't we agree

917
00:38:45,070 --> 00:38:46,950
that you could have one month off?

918
00:38:47,660 --> 00:38:49,610
You want me to rest for a month?

919
00:38:49,790 --> 00:38:51,050
I'd love to.

920
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:53,160
But my subordinate...

921
00:38:53,180 --> 00:38:54,150
Lu Lingfeng...

922
00:38:55,940 --> 00:38:58,900
If he wants to patrol around Nanzhou,

923
00:38:59,150 --> 00:39:01,830
I am willing to accompany him everywhere.

924
00:39:01,870 --> 00:39:02,700
No need.

925
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:06,100
He is young.

926
00:39:06,630 --> 00:39:08,820
I'm afraid he can't stay idle.

927
00:39:09,810 --> 00:39:12,030
But Lu

928
00:39:12,250 --> 00:39:13,420
is too special.

929
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:17,500
It's hard for me to take care of him too much.

930
00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:19,580
No need for special care.

931
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:21,290
Just let him do something.

932
00:39:21,410 --> 00:39:22,920
You can order him around.

933
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:24,170
Well...

934
00:39:25,010 --> 00:39:25,970
Is that OK?

935
00:39:30,410 --> 00:39:34,100
That the Crown Prince asked him to go south with me,

936
00:39:34,710 --> 00:39:36,330
I think,

937
00:39:36,570 --> 00:39:37,780
is to train him.

938
00:39:39,150 --> 00:39:40,260
He came from a noble family

939
00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:41,970
and then became an official at a young age.

940
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:44,980
It was really an important official for such a young man.

941
00:39:45,490 --> 00:39:46,470
In the future,

942
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:49,660
if he continues to get promoted and entrusted with essential tasks,

943
00:39:49,780 --> 00:39:51,300
what will he lack the most?

944
00:39:52,370 --> 00:39:54,420
You know it more clearly than I do.

945
00:39:56,140 --> 00:39:58,620
The mother of the Minister of Justice

946
00:39:58,850 --> 00:40:00,020
just passed away.

947
00:40:00,210 --> 00:40:02,450
He is in mourning for his mother's death in his hometown.

948
00:40:02,820 --> 00:40:05,740
But Nanzhou is far away from the court.

949
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:07,400
It takes a long time

950
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:08,900
to dispatch a new official.

951
00:40:09,750 --> 00:40:12,180
But we need a minister of justice here

952
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:14,380
to capture thieves.

953
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:16,620
If you agree,

954
00:40:17,310 --> 00:40:19,250
General Lu may

955
00:40:20,050 --> 00:40:21,550
be the substitute for the time being.

956
00:40:22,750 --> 00:40:23,820
The Minister of Justice?

957
00:40:24,740 --> 00:40:25,420
Su Wuming,

958
00:40:25,940 --> 00:40:26,880
do you feel guilty to the court

959
00:40:27,690 --> 00:40:28,950
by doing so?

960
00:40:30,980 --> 00:40:32,550
What do you mean?

961
00:40:32,570 --> 00:40:33,420
Stop pretending.

962
00:40:33,660 --> 00:40:34,640
I'm a sinner.

963
00:40:35,050 --> 00:40:36,150
Did you tell Governor Xiong?

964
00:40:39,850 --> 00:40:42,120
I didn't.

965
00:40:42,330 --> 00:40:43,890
If this reaches Chang'an,

966
00:40:44,390 --> 00:40:45,970
Governor Xiong will be implicated too.

967
00:40:51,980 --> 00:40:54,930
I've read all the files

968
00:40:56,300 --> 00:40:57,780
in the Judicial Administration Office.

969
00:40:58,490 --> 00:41:00,420
There are many old cases.

970
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:03,130
This is what I hate the most.

971
00:41:04,020 --> 00:41:05,940
So I can't leave the position vacant anymore.

972
00:41:07,030 --> 00:41:08,410
As the Commander,

973
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:10,280
I am willing to take the responsibility

974
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:13,280
to assign you to be the minister temporarily.

975
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:16,340
Didn't you say you cared about the country?

976
00:41:16,470 --> 00:41:18,130
My master Detective Di once said

977
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:19,440
that working for the people

978
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:20,940
was caring about the country.

979
00:41:23,230 --> 00:41:25,380
Do you take it or not?

980
00:41:25,540 --> 00:41:26,710
Answer me now!

981
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:32,940
I do!

982
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:35,590
But I want to move out of the Commander's Residence.

983
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:37,690
Why?

984
00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:38,740
I may stay.

985
00:41:39,660 --> 00:41:40,510
Then you must

986
00:41:41,030 --> 00:41:42,350
send Pei Xijun back to Chang'an as soon as possible.

987
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:46,260
Since I will be in charge of justice,

988
00:41:46,740 --> 00:41:48,230
I can't let people gossip.

989
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:10,040
Morning, Minister Lu.

990
00:42:11,420 --> 00:42:12,130
Morning, Miss Pei.

991
00:42:24,930 --> 00:42:25,630
Sir, you call me here?

992
00:42:26,110 --> 00:42:26,910
Have a seat.

993
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:30,820
Miss Xijun,

994
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:33,060
Nanzhou is humid.

995
00:42:33,140 --> 00:42:33,970
It's not as livable as Chang'an.

996
00:42:34,380 --> 00:42:35,920
You must be very uncomfortable here.

997
00:42:37,070 --> 00:42:38,540
Yesterday, Governor Xiong mentioned

998
00:42:38,570 --> 00:42:40,920
that he would send someone to escort you back to the north.

999
00:42:42,370 --> 00:42:43,500
When do you want to leave?

1000
00:42:43,910 --> 00:42:45,540
Are you chasing me away?

1001
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:03,810

00:45:34,810 --> 00:45:36,730
♫What is the meaning of life and death?♫

1034
00:45:36,950 --> 00:45:41,080
♫I'll paint the sunshine into the landscape♫

1035
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:43,120
♫The spirit of righteousness♫

1036
00:45:43,340 --> 00:45:46,750
♫Exists for the one I care♫
