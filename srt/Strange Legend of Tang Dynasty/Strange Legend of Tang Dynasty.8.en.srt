00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:46,490
Although I practice martial art,

5
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:50,560
but what I've recited just now doesn't sound bad, right?

6
00:01:53,289 --> 00:01:54,450
You are a government official,

7
00:01:54,850 --> 00:01:55,970
but you kidnap the innocents.

8
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:57,330
Is there no law?

9
00:01:57,490 --> 00:01:59,100
You can't say that.

10
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:00,850
I saw you walking alone

11
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:02,610
in the wilderness,

12
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,690
it's dangerous to do so for a girl at night,

13
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,440
so I asked you to get in

14
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:07,460
and invited you to go with me.

15
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:08,530
I'm heading south,

16
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:09,440
and you're heading north.

17
00:02:09,650 --> 00:02:10,490
How can we be on the same path?

18
00:02:10,509 --> 00:02:12,730
We are on the same path when we met.

19
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:14,610
It's fate

20
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:15,940
for us to meet in the wilderness.

21
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:16,579
Shut up!

22
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:17,820
Where is the man with me?

23
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:19,470
Is he still alive?

24
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:20,829
He's fine.

25
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:22,970
I was afraid he might get lost,

26
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:24,390
so I tied him behind the car.

27
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:26,760
How can a person like you

28
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:29,260
deserve to be a colonel?

29
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:30,780
That's not true.

and think about it.

35
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:41,500
Someone will invite you

36
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:43,510
to the upper room to rest later.

37
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:51,570
The windows has been sealed.

38

This girl is very weak,

41
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:05,450
just lock the door.

42
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,560
No need to send someone to guard her,

43
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:07,640

00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:25,920
even though it's an abandoned stage station,

48
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:27,020
but the mian rooms

49
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:28,450
are spacious and clean,

50
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:29,800

52
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:35,160
get some and stew them.

53
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:38,060
Don't catch the chickens.

54
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:39,010
Don't catch the chickens.

55

56

Can't I catch a few chickens?

57
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:45,350
Do you want to die?

58

No.

59
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:47,340
If you wan to eat the chicken,

60
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:50,110
you have to kill it, boil water, and remove its feathers.

61

The reason why our stage station is abandoned is

because it's haunted.

stay in other rooms

177
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:02,540
other than the right main room?

178
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:03,760
Lead the way.

179
00:11:07,690 --> 00:11:08,130
Wait.

180
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:11,270
I came here first.

181
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,840
The right main room is mine.

182
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:15,520
Who do you think you are

183
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:17,860
to stay in that room

184
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:18,820
without my permission?

185
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:25,020
Although you're from a noble family,

186
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:27,940
you're just an assistant of county magistrate.

187
00:11:27,970 --> 00:11:29,050
So what?

188
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:31,140
Even if the four noble families are just commoner,

189
00:11:31,170 --> 00:11:32,580
they still have higher position than the ministers.

190
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:34,470
Do you really want to

191
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:36,960
fight with me for the room?

192
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:48,020
You can have the room.

193
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:49,300
You can have the room!

194
00:11:54,210 --> 00:11:54,820
Colonel,

195
00:11:56,130 --> 00:11:57,950
are you really going to swallow the insult?

196
00:11:58,210 --> 00:12:00,040
His surname is Cui,

197
00:12:00,650 --> 00:12:02,010
what can I do if I opposed?

198
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:27,460
Magistrate Cui,

199
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:28,790
take a rest,

200
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:30,240
I'll take my leave.

201
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:31,580
Get lost.

202
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:45,070
General,

203
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:46,790
thank you for saving my life.

204
00:12:49,130 --> 00:12:49,770
No worries,

205
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:51,560
I'm no longer a general.

206
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:53,420
You may not be a general,

207
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:54,960
but you're still

208
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:55,640
a great hero.

209
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,020
I was once disrespectful to you,

210
00:12:58,730 --> 00:12:59,840
I was ignorant.

211
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:01,340
My lady said that

212
00:13:01,570 --> 00:13:02,770
if you can take me as your disciple,

213
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:03,880
I can honor my ancestor

214
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:04,900
in the future.

215
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:06,000
General Lu,

216
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:07,470
please take me as your disciple.

217
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:09,300
What?

218
00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:11,310
My ancestor

219
00:13:11,330 --> 00:13:12,660
is the famous Xue Rengui.

220
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:14,030
I want to be like him

221
00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:14,610
fight on the battlefield,

222
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:15,430
and make achievements.

223
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:16,890
My lady said that

224
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:17,880
you are the only one who can help me to

225
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:18,910
fulfill my dream.

226
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:20,640
That's why I left Chang'an with my lady

227
00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:22,190
to find you.

228
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:25,270
You just get

229
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:26,910
such an ignorant kid

230
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:27,540
to protect you.

231
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:29,020
How dare you leave Chang'an?

232
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:31,120
I'm already 12 years old.

233
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:32,270
I'm not a kid anymore.

234
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:33,700
Take your lady

235
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:34,350
back to Chang'an now!

236
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:35,650
No way!

237
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:37,620
You are just

238
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:38,900
a fool who knows nothing.

239
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:39,920
Shut up!

240
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:41,310
Lu Lingfeng,

241
00:13:42,010 --> 00:13:42,730
I'm not stupid.

242
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:44,100
I know my lady

243
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:44,970
has been fooling me.

244
00:13:45,510 --> 00:13:46,270
She left Chang'an

245
00:13:46,370 --> 00:13:47,370
just to find you.

246
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:49,660
I fought you that day.

247
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:51,220
Although you have some martial arts skills,

248
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,610
but you are not qualified

249
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:53,870
as my master.

250
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:56,080
If you are really the great hero

251
00:13:56,110 --> 00:13:57,680
as my lady said,

252
00:13:57,900 --> 00:13:58,680
you wouldn't have taken us

253
00:13:58,700 --> 00:13:59,710
to sneak away.

254
00:14:00,090 --> 00:14:01,160
You would have

255
00:14:01,190 --> 00:14:01,670
killed that colonel

256
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:03,090
to revenge for my lady.

257
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:11,380
Come here.

258
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:20,180
I'll take care of the bastard

259
00:14:20,210 --> 00:14:21,530
who bullied your lady.

260
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:23,600
Take your lady and

261
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:24,200
get back to Chang'an.

262
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:25,890
I'm doing this for her own good.

263
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,520
If you were really loyal to her,

264
00:14:28,730 --> 00:14:30,020
you should listen to me.

265
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:37,110
Miss,

266
00:14:38,070 --> 00:14:39,510
I've regretted leaving with you

267
00:14:39,770 --> 00:14:40,970
from Chang'an.

268
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:43,030
Especially when we met that bastard,

269
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:44,290
I'm so scared.

270
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:45,540
If we

271
00:14:45,570 --> 00:14:46,650
has not met General,

272
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:48,370
the consequences would be unimaginable.

273
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:50,350
Why don't we go back?

274
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:51,090
Your life

275
00:14:51,210 --> 00:14:52,580
is much more precious than mine.

276
00:14:52,930 --> 00:14:54,090
That's right.

277
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:56,310
Leave?

278
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:57,030
Sure.

279
00:14:57,550 --> 00:14:58,790
But it's late at night now and

280
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:00,420
there are remote mountains everywhere.

281
00:15:00,930 --> 00:15:01,610
What if

282
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:03,290
I encountered a wolf?

283
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:07,230
What do you want then?

284
00:15:08,170 --> 00:15:09,640
I want you to

285
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:10,540
send me back to Chang'an personally.

286
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:11,570
Otherwise,

287
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:12,320
I won't leave.

288
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:13,180
You.

289
00:15:13,650 --> 00:15:14,500
How about

290
00:15:14,950 --> 00:15:15,830
taking me

291
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:17,700
to visit Su Wuming?

292
00:15:18,190 --> 00:15:19,720
I'll return to Chang'an tomorrow morning,

293
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:21,490
I don't need you to send me then.

294
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:41,570
After dinner,

295
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:42,700
you may rest in the first room

296
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,200
at the right wing.

297
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:45,440
That room is big.

298
00:15:45,990 --> 00:15:47,830
Last month, there's a wandering monk

299
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:48,910
stayed here.

300
00:15:59,180 --> 00:15:59,770
Lu Lingfeng!

301
00:16:28,630 --> 00:16:29,230
Liu Shiba,

302
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:30,890
did you see

303
00:16:30,930 --> 00:16:32,000
my personal staff?

304
00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:36,160
Who is in the main hall?

305
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:39,460
A colonel who guards the capital.

306
00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:40,870
Colonel?

307
00:16:42,630 --> 00:16:43,760
My personal staff

308
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:44,970
was a general before.

309
00:16:45,390 --> 00:16:46,910
I guess he is drinking with them.

310
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:03,110
Who are you?

311
00:17:03,570 --> 00:17:04,569
I am

312
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,960
the new Military Commander of Nanzhou, Su Wuming.

313
00:17:08,410 --> 00:17:09,849
A state Military Commander,

314
00:17:10,579 --> 00:17:11,380
that's not worth mentioning.

315
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:12,130
Yes.

316
00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:14,950
Wait.

317
00:17:16,810 --> 00:17:18,790
What was your position before this?

318
00:17:20,089 --> 00:17:22,650
I used to be the sheriff of Chang'an.

319
00:17:23,130 --> 00:17:24,380
An official in the capital?

320
00:17:24,930 --> 00:17:25,630
Come on.

321
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:26,560
Sit down and have a drink.

322
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:28,440
I can't drink.

323
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:30,490
You're just a Military Commander,

324
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:33,480
how dare you resist

325
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:34,850
my order to drink?

326
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:35,870
Come here.

327
00:17:36,330 --> 00:17:36,730
Sit down.

328
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:40,360
You can drink.

329
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:41,690
Drink.

330
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:42,440
You're a good drinker.

331
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:43,630
Pour some wine.

332
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:52,740
Tell me.

333
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:54,600
What's new

334
00:17:54,890 --> 00:17:56,080
in Chang'an recently?

335
00:17:56,830 --> 00:17:58,900
Is Xuandu Temple still haunted?

336
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:03,090
Is the most adorable dancer in Pingkang Fang

337
00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:04,520
still there?

338
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:08,560
Being a Colonel of Zhechong Regiment

339
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:10,520
in this place,

340
00:18:11,430 --> 00:18:12,530
seems to be powerful

341
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:14,290
in others' eyes.

342
00:18:15,170 --> 00:18:15,940
Actually,

343
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:17,430
it's miserable.

344
00:18:17,450 --> 00:18:18,140
Let me do it.

345
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:20,100
I wonder if

346
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:23,170
I can stay  in Chang'an this time.

347
00:18:23,490 --> 00:18:25,090
If I can stay,

348
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:28,710
that's what it meant by good fortune.

349
00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:30,750
It seems that

350
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:32,170
you are an ambitious man.

351
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:34,180
What do you mean?

352
00:18:34,550 --> 00:18:36,210
You are not good with words.

353
00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:38,080
It's my wish

354
00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:39,320
to excel in both civil and military abilities.

355
00:18:41,130 --> 00:18:41,490
Well,

356
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:43,540
I wish

357
00:18:43,570 --> 00:18:45,330
your wish will come true soon.

358
00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:49,720
That's what I want to hear.

359
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:51,140
Here.

360
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:53,450
May Colonel's wish come true!

361
00:18:53,950 --> 00:18:56,510
May Colonel's wish come true!

362
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:56,960
Drink!

363
00:18:57,260 --> 00:18:57,960
Come on!

364
00:18:58,290 --> 00:18:58,690
Drink!

365
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:07,960
Liu Shiba,

366
00:19:09,410 --> 00:19:12,880
you are treating them differently.

367
00:19:14,690 --> 00:19:16,900
They caught the chicken themselves,

368
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:18,540
I have to cook it.

369
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:20,860
I'm afraid of losing my head too.

370
00:19:20,970 --> 00:19:21,550
All right.

371
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:22,380
You can leave now.

372
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:24,060
Here.

373
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:25,990
I'm waiting to hear more

374
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:27,180
about Chang'an.

375
00:19:27,490 --> 00:19:28,540
Tell me.

376
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:33,170
Let me tell you about

377
00:19:33,970 --> 00:19:35,690
the Changan black tea.

378
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:37,700
Okay.

379
00:19:38,930 --> 00:19:39,570
Su Wuming.

380
00:19:41,150 --> 00:19:41,750
Su Wuming.

381
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:43,980
Su Wuming.

382
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:01,860
I think he woke up in the middle of the night,

383
00:20:01,890 --> 00:20:02,640
and went to look for me

384
00:20:02,690 --> 00:20:03,210
after I went missing.

385
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:04,380
Both of you wait here,

386
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:05,350
I’ll be back soon.

387
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:07,730
You are quite good at

388
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:09,470
telling jokes.

389
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:12,620
I would honor you with

390
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:13,890
another bowl of wine with you.

391
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:14,460
Here.

392
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:17,820
Su Wuming!

393
00:20:18,290 --> 00:20:19,290
Why are you not sleeping,

394
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:20,720
but drinking

395
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:21,920
with this bastard?

396
00:20:22,970 --> 00:20:23,490
How dare you!

397
00:20:23,710 --> 00:20:24,520
Who are you?

398
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:27,190
It's none of your business.

399
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:31,760
Don't be rude.

400
00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:33,890
Why are you holding a dagger?

401
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:35,110
If you're scared, just move away!

402
00:20:35,530 --> 00:20:36,000
Today,

403
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:37,410
I will take

404
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:38,690
kill this bastard Yu.

405
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:42,620
What is your position?

406
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:45,210
How dare you

407
00:20:45,230 --> 00:20:46,130
act this ruthlessly in front of me!

408
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:46,620
I

409
00:20:49,510 --> 00:20:50,330
have no official position.

410
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:52,490
Lu Lingfeng from Fanyang.

411
00:20:53,890 --> 00:20:54,990
He's my attendant.

412
00:20:56,690 --> 00:20:59,320
You are from the Lu family of Fan Yang,

413
00:21:00,030 --> 00:21:01,650
but you are an attendant

414
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:02,420
of the state Military Commander?

415
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:03,530
I think

416
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:05,600
you status of the noble family

417
00:21:06,010 --> 00:21:07,090
is fake, right?

418
00:21:07,570 --> 00:21:08,570
Go to hell

419
00:21:08,810 --> 00:21:09,940
and ask the King of Hell

420
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,080
if I was lying!

421
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:15,390
Su Wuming, get out of the way!

422
00:21:15,710 --> 00:21:16,510
What are you doing?

423
00:21:17,090 --> 00:21:18,050
Why are you fighting with others

424
00:21:18,090 --> 00:21:19,470
for no reason?

425
00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:21,460
This bastard kidnapped Xijun

426
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:22,420
on the way,

427
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:24,300
and tried to rape her.

428
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:25,810
Xijun?

429
00:21:26,730 --> 00:21:27,820
You must be mistaken.

430
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:29,660
How could Xijun leave Chang'an

431
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:30,630
and come here?

432
00:21:30,690 --> 00:21:31,330
It can't be wrong.

433
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:32,860
I've saved her,

434
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:34,470
and asked about everything.

435
00:21:43,430 --> 00:21:44,110
You should leave now.

436
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:46,300
This place will be covered in blood in no time.

437
00:21:46,510 --> 00:21:47,630
I don't want to hurt you.

438
00:21:49,010 --> 00:21:50,530
They are outnumbered.

439
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:51,500
In my opinion,

440
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:53,000
we should plan for any further actions.

441
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:53,860
Cut the crap.

442
00:21:57,830 --> 00:21:58,810
The rope on the door was cut,

443
00:21:58,970 --> 00:21:59,510
she's gone.

444
00:22:03,850 --> 00:22:04,370
What?

445
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:07,560
You two know that woman?

446
00:22:08,170 --> 00:22:09,810
It's true

447
00:22:10,110 --> 00:22:11,020
about the kidnapping mentioned earlier.

448
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:14,200
But it wasn't me kidnapping,

449
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:16,620
it is that woman's servant

450
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,320
kidnapped her

451
00:22:18,770 --> 00:22:19,770
and wanted to sell her.

452
00:22:20,410 --> 00:22:21,710
I ran into the situation,

453
00:22:21,810 --> 00:22:23,080
and wanted to help her out.

454
00:22:23,410 --> 00:22:24,290
Nonsense!

455
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:25,600
The servant, Xue Huan

456
00:22:26,090 --> 00:22:27,180
is just a child.

457
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:30,400
Don't judge a book by its cover.

458
00:22:30,910 --> 00:22:31,820
He is young,

459
00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:32,930
but he's very cunning.

460
00:22:33,410 --> 00:22:34,800
Even his lady

461
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:35,780
was cheated by him.

462
00:22:36,630 --> 00:22:38,670
My underling heard

463
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:40,830
his bargaining with the human traffickers.

464
00:22:41,290 --> 00:22:41,940
That's right.

465
00:22:42,390 --> 00:22:43,810
The one who kidnapped that woman is

466
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:45,440
the young servant,

467
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:47,700
our Colonel is the one who saved people.

468
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:51,000
See!

469
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:52,340
Lu Lingfeng,

470
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:53,640
are you out of your mind?

471
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:54,820
Don't believe his words.

472
00:22:56,820 --> 00:22:57,730
These people

473
00:22:58,260 --> 00:22:59,470
are all treacherous people.

474
00:22:59,490 --> 00:23:00,620
Who the hell do you think you are!

475
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:02,570
How can you say that to the high-ranking officials?

476
00:23:05,230 --> 00:23:06,010
Put your sword away.

477
00:23:07,570 --> 00:23:07,960
You...

478
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:12,820
Well...

479
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:14,490
Colonel,

480
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:18,230
my attendant is just a reckless man.

481
00:23:18,350 --> 00:23:20,090
He must have misunderstood.

482
00:23:20,490 --> 00:23:22,430
I apologize to you

483
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:24,430
on behalf of my attendant.

484
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:25,980
Every...

485
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:27,420
Everyone,

486
00:23:28,130 --> 00:23:29,780
don't be so tense.

487
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,950
Hurry up. Put your weapons away.

488
00:23:33,050 --> 00:23:33,990
Put them away.

489
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:39,980
After we part in Chang'an,

490
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:41,390
Miss Xijun and I haven't seen

491
00:23:41,410 --> 00:23:42,540
each other for a long time.

492
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:43,900
Hurry up. Take me to where she is.

493
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:45,300
Let's go, go.

494
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:46,060
Go!

495
00:23:52,690 --> 00:23:53,130
Colonel,

496
00:23:54,210 --> 00:23:56,360
why are you so nice today?

497
00:23:57,110 --> 00:23:59,710
That Lu now has no official title on him either.

498
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:01,640
How dare he be so rude to you?

499
00:24:02,550 --> 00:24:04,180
Why didn't you give us an order,

500
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:06,190
and we can just chopped his head off?

501
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:09,650
Is it him I am afraid of?

502
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:12,910
What I'm afraid is the one upstairs.

503
00:24:18,630 --> 00:24:20,570
The Cui family from Qinghe

504
00:24:21,050 --> 00:24:22,630
is the most prominent among the noble families in the world.

505
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:25,010
Although he's just a assistant of county magistrate,

506
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:28,210
his words are still powerful.

507
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,680
No sound at all.

508
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:33,100
He must be asleep.

509
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:35,540
We've made a scene,

510
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:37,330
even if he fell asleep,

511
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:39,100
he would have be waken up by us long ago.

512
00:24:39,810 --> 00:24:40,690
I think

513
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:42,870
he just doesn't want to come down.

514
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:44,400
Come with me.

515
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:48,180
About that woman,

516
00:24:48,390 --> 00:24:49,130
we can't never let the Cui

517
00:24:49,150 --> 00:24:50,230
be aware of it.

518
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:54,610
We can only shut him up now for good.

519
00:25:06,070 --> 00:25:06,630
Where is he?

520
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:10,700
Colonel,

521
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:13,120
that corvee said

522
00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:14,910
this room is haunted,

523
00:25:15,610 --> 00:25:16,240
there's ghost around here.

524
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:20,570
Could this person be... by the ghost...

525
00:25:24,850 --> 00:25:25,970
Even if the ghost eats people,

526
00:25:26,230 --> 00:25:27,760
there must be a sound.

527
00:25:28,770 --> 00:25:30,250
I'd rather believe

528
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:31,510
that Cui Wuji

529
00:25:31,710 --> 00:25:32,470
heard us

530
00:25:32,490 --> 00:25:33,540
down there

531
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:35,650
and decided to jump off the window and ran away.

532
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:36,860
Colonel is right.

533
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:37,840
I'll go after him now.

534
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:38,410
No need.

535
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:41,830
Since he is such a coward,

536
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:43,500
he wouldn't dare to tell on us.

537
00:25:44,250 --> 00:25:45,040
Let him be.

538
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:05,000
Greetings, sir.

539
00:26:05,810 --> 00:26:06,410
Young man,

540
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:07,560
raise your head.

541
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:11,390
Your name is Xue Huan?

542
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:17,110
This young man's eyes are as bright as the stars,

543
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:18,210
there's no sign of evil.

544
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:20,100
This Yu

545
00:26:20,190 --> 00:26:21,630
is full of nonsense.

546
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:25,050
This Gantang Post

547
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:27,730
is neither full of good people nor a good post.

548
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:29,500
We have to leave now.

549
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:31,800
Did you find something?

550
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:35,930
Let's leave first.

551
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:37,090
I will tell you on the way.

552
00:26:38,310 --> 00:26:39,230
Su,

553
00:26:41,090 --> 00:26:42,660
can you open the door?

554
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:44,370
Let's have another talk.

555
00:26:46,450 --> 00:26:48,400
I know you are in the room.

556
00:26:49,010 --> 00:26:50,060
The back windows of the Post

557
00:26:50,090 --> 00:26:51,320
were all nailed shut.

558
00:26:51,810 --> 00:26:53,520
You can't escape from the window.

559
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:55,120
Say something.

560
00:27:00,190 --> 00:27:01,740
I'm here.

561
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:02,980
You claimed that

562
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:04,800
you are heading to Nanzhou as the new Military Commander,

563
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:06,620
but I didn't see your official tablet.

564
00:27:07,290 --> 00:27:07,880
Sir,

565
00:27:08,410 --> 00:27:10,090
can you show it to me?

566
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:14,750
The official certificate of my position

567
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:16,180
should be handed over in person to

568
00:27:16,210 --> 00:27:18,490
the prefectural governor who supervises the state and county.

569
00:27:18,950 --> 00:27:21,080
You and I met at a deserted post,

570
00:27:21,810 --> 00:27:23,120
you have no right to check.

571
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:30,380
Even though we met at a deserted post,

572
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:32,340
but I am the Colonel of Zhechong Regiment.

573
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:34,400
Why can't I

574
00:27:34,830 --> 00:27:35,860
check your official tablet?

575
00:27:36,610 --> 00:27:37,210
That's right.

576
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:40,440
Even the lowest-ranking colonel

577
00:27:40,470 --> 00:27:41,680
is still a fifth-rank official,

578
00:27:41,970 --> 00:27:43,690
ranked higher than me, a military commander.

579
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:44,810
But have you forgotten that

580
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:46,740
we just met by coincidence.

581
00:27:47,050 --> 00:27:48,660
Even if you are a third-rank official,

582
00:27:48,690 --> 00:27:51,250
you have no right to check my official tablet.

583
00:27:51,530 --> 00:27:52,240
Really?

584
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:55,800
You sound right,

585
00:27:56,060 --> 00:27:58,070
but that big guy beside you

586
00:27:58,180 --> 00:27:58,990
is holding a weapon,

587
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:00,050
he doesn't look like a good person.

588
00:28:00,590 --> 00:28:02,110
I suspect that he's a fugitive.

589
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:03,100
Hand him over!

590
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:04,620
I want to interrogate him!

591
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:06,330
You bastard!

592
00:28:06,850 --> 00:28:08,330
You kidnapped a woman from an innocent family,

593
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:10,290
How dare you accuse me of being a fugitive?

594
00:28:26,770 --> 00:28:27,720
You bastard!

595
00:28:28,010 --> 00:28:29,020
How dare you stab me in the back.

596
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:30,540
Today, I, Lu Lingfeng,

597
00:28:30,710 --> 00:28:31,910
will kill you!

598
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:32,780
Shoot!

599
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:36,360
The two of you inside.

600
00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:37,900
One pretended to be a military commander

601
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:38,980
who can't show his official tablet.

602
00:28:39,390 --> 00:28:41,120
The other one pretended to be a member of the noble family,

603
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:43,130
and tried to assault with a weapon.

604
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:44,180
I think

605
00:28:44,610 --> 00:28:45,440
you two are just a pair of

606
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:46,340
bandits.

607
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:48,250
You're unlucky

608
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:49,330
to meet me today.

609
00:28:50,010 --> 00:28:50,590
Guards!

610
00:28:51,090 --> 00:28:52,850
Execute them on the spot!

611
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:53,610
Yes.

612
00:28:53,890 --> 00:28:54,740
Why are you pulling me? Let go of me!

613
00:29:06,950 --> 00:29:08,750
How cunning.

614
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:10,950
Be patient.

615
00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:13,030
Whoever comes out,

616
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:14,860
shoot him to death.

617
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:15,900
-Yes. -Yes.

618
00:29:16,450 --> 00:29:17,150
Lu Lingfeng,

619
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:19,270
judging from their archery skills,

620
00:29:19,530 --> 00:29:20,730
they are all well trained.

621
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:21,780
You're injured,

622
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:22,980
don't fight them head-on.

623
00:29:23,330 --> 00:29:24,260
If you hadn't stopped me,

624
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:25,430
and had the opportunity missed,

625
00:29:26,210 --> 00:29:26,950
I would have killed

626
00:29:27,310 --> 00:29:28,190
that bastard Yu

627
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:29,280
at this time.

628
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:30,960
Listen, Su Wuming.

629
00:29:31,570 --> 00:29:32,980
To prevent them from attacking us behind our backs,

630
00:29:33,470 --> 00:29:34,790
after I rush out,

631
00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:36,000
you and Xue Huan

632
00:29:36,030 --> 00:29:36,790
shall guard the door with your lives.

633
00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:38,220
No matter what,

634
00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:40,060
don't let them in.

635
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:54,240
You bandit

636
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:55,420
even have a spear?

637
00:29:56,230 --> 00:29:57,220
Get me my pike!

638
00:30:02,010 --> 00:30:02,690
Kid,

639
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:04,440
The pike in my hand

640
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,330
has killed dozens of people.

641
00:30:06,890 --> 00:30:08,260
I haven't used it for years.

642
00:30:08,690 --> 00:30:09,290
Today,

643
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:11,640
I'll feed him with your blood.

644
00:30:34,250 --> 00:30:35,050
What are you waiting for?

645
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:36,480
Shoot him! Shoot him!

646
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:45,960
You do have something.

647
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,260
You are not an ordinary person.

648
00:30:49,550 --> 00:30:50,510
But it doesn't matter.

649
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,310
He's injured.

650
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:54,260
You all see that, right?

651
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:56,070
We shall take our turns and go one by one.

652
00:30:56,690 --> 00:30:57,910
We must kill him

653
00:30:57,940 --> 00:30:58,840
no matter what it takes!

654
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:17,740
Stop!

655
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:26,610
Don't hurt her.

656
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:27,940
Colonel,

657
00:31:28,170 --> 00:31:29,090
If I slashes her throat,

658
00:31:29,270 --> 00:31:30,840
he must be distracted.

659
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:32,390
If you cut my throat,

660
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:33,940
he'll only be triggered and fight even harder,

661
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:35,580
and he will kill you all.

662
00:31:35,830 --> 00:31:36,860
Try it if you don't believe me.

663
00:31:40,250 --> 00:31:40,910
Su Wuming,

664
00:31:41,530 --> 00:31:42,540
you are useless,

665
00:31:43,390 --> 00:31:44,590
you can't even keep a woman in sight.

666
00:31:45,370 --> 00:31:46,110
Lu Lingfeng,

667
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:47,660
stop pretending.

668
00:31:48,650 --> 00:31:50,330
Didn't you just want me to die?

669
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:58,670
Colonel Yu,

670
00:31:59,610 --> 00:32:00,630
stop fighting.

671
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:02,870
I know this fight

672
00:32:02,910 --> 00:32:03,860
is all because of me,

673
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,820
but I don't want to see you all to

674
00:32:06,990 --> 00:32:08,760
die by Lu Lingfeng's spear.

675
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:10,630
Of course,

676
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:13,320
I don't want to see the one I once loved

677
00:32:13,670 --> 00:32:15,410
die in front of me.

678
00:32:20,690 --> 00:32:21,280
Golonel Yu,

679
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:23,960
you've come to Chang'an this time,

680
00:32:24,310 --> 00:32:25,680
to take shifts to protect the capital.

681
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:28,440
There are hundreds of Zhechong Regiments in Tang.

682
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:30,100
You colonels

683
00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:31,700
have been training in the state

684
00:32:31,850 --> 00:32:33,200
for years.

685
00:32:33,790 --> 00:32:35,190
I heard that it was very tough.

686
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:37,910
Coming to the capital this time,

687
00:32:38,490 --> 00:32:39,050
don't you want to

688
00:32:39,090 --> 00:32:40,500
stay in the capital as an official?

689
00:32:41,690 --> 00:32:42,550
Who are

690
00:32:43,130 --> 00:32:44,320
you really?

691
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:45,820
You even know this?

692
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:47,600
Could it be that fake military commander in there

693
00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:48,380
taught you to say those things,

694
00:32:48,610 --> 00:32:49,980
and tried to fool me?

695
00:32:50,170 --> 00:32:51,160
My surname is Pei.

696
00:32:53,060 --> 00:32:53,770
Pei?

697
00:32:54,750 --> 00:32:55,460
Which Pei?

698
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:57,290
The Pei from Hedong.

699
00:32:58,710 --> 00:33:00,140
The four great clans in the the central Shaanxi plain,

700
00:33:00,710 --> 00:33:02,240
Wei, Pei, Liu, Xue.

701
00:33:02,910 --> 00:33:03,960
You are from that Pei family.

702
00:33:04,130 --> 00:33:05,010
You're right.

703
00:33:05,510 --> 00:33:07,470
The four families are ranked closest to the Emperor.

704
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:09,590
I am one of the Pei.

705
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:11,000
Colonel,

706
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:12,650
this woman is a liar, right?

707
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:13,580
No.

708
00:33:14,510 --> 00:33:16,440
The reason I held her

709
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:19,160
is that  I was attracted by her temperament.

710
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:20,070
Pei Xijun,

711
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:22,390
it's wrong to run away from home

712
00:33:22,410 --> 00:33:23,210
without your father's permission.

713
00:33:23,830 --> 00:33:25,150
Now you are making more mistakes

714
00:33:25,180 --> 00:33:25,890
by telling all these

715
00:33:26,330 --> 00:33:27,470
to this bastard.

716
00:33:28,070 --> 00:33:29,840
My mistake is falling into you!

717
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:47,900
Colonel Yu,

718
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:49,800
let me tell you the truth.

719
00:33:51,130 --> 00:33:52,510
I am the daughter of Pei Jian,

720
00:33:52,540 --> 00:33:53,520
the Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Personnel Administration,

721
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:54,820
Pei Xijun.

722
00:33:58,170 --> 00:33:59,250
My family had found me

723
00:33:59,290 --> 00:33:59,930
a fiancé,

724
00:34:00,290 --> 00:34:01,410
but I fell in love with him.

725
00:34:02,650 --> 00:34:03,730
My father wouldn't agree to this.

726
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:05,420
So I took my servants

727
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:07,110
and sneaked out from Chang'an

728
00:34:07,390 --> 00:34:08,380
just to find him

729
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:09,340
and to elope with him.

730
00:34:10,050 --> 00:34:12,330
I didn't expect that

731
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:13,679
he would be an unreliable man.

732
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:16,850
He doesn't have feelings for me at all.

733
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:18,690
His kindness to me

734
00:34:18,710 --> 00:34:19,510
was just an act.

735
00:34:19,659 --> 00:34:20,580
He just covets

736
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:21,580
my family's wealth.

737
00:34:26,620 --> 00:34:27,389
I don't want you

738
00:34:27,420 --> 00:34:28,460
to fight anymore.

739
00:34:29,139 --> 00:34:31,179
Even if Lu Lingfeng kills all of you,

740
00:34:31,770 --> 00:34:33,040
he won't take me away.

741
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:35,840
He is just

742
00:34:35,870 --> 00:34:37,330
a bloodthirsty killer.

743
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:42,070
Didn't you just see

744
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:43,199
he was injured?

745
00:34:44,350 --> 00:34:45,860
That's because,

746
00:34:46,630 --> 00:34:47,980
he killed the Ghost Four in Chang'an.

747
00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:52,699
What Four?

748
00:34:53,380 --> 00:34:55,130
I've heard of that.

749
00:34:55,780 --> 00:34:56,620
Those four freaks

750
00:34:56,900 --> 00:34:58,660
are all top masters.

751
00:34:59,910 --> 00:35:02,450
Are you really Assistant Minister Pei's daughter?

752
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:11,060
My father is in charge of

753
00:35:11,430 --> 00:35:13,270
the adjustment and appointment of officials.

754
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:14,700
If Colonel Yu

755
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:16,280
don't want to spend the rest of your life training soldiers in all states,

756
00:35:16,460 --> 00:35:17,820
and wish to stay in the capital as an official,

757
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:19,160
tell your men

758
00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:19,940
to stop now.

759
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:22,470
Escort me back to the capital tomorrow morning.

760
00:35:24,010 --> 00:35:25,450
My father has only one daughter,

761
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:27,220
and he loves me very much.

762
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:29,220
When we get to the capital,

763
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:30,460
I'll tell him

764
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:31,850
you saved my life

765
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:32,670
from the bad guys.

766
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:34,060
At that time,

767
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:36,200
he will help you.

768
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:43,590
Colonel,

769
00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:46,290
you can't trust that woman easily.

770
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:47,920
But I can't ignore her words too.

771
00:35:48,610 --> 00:35:49,660
How could an ordinary woman

772
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:51,660
say something like that?

773
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:56,100
I didn't expect

774
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:57,570
to meet Miss Pei here.

775
00:35:58,140 --> 00:35:59,660
Sorry for my wrongdoings,

776
00:36:00,090 --> 00:36:02,540
you won't hold a grudge against me, right?

777
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:03,500
No.

778
00:36:04,510 --> 00:36:05,870
You may be reckless,

779
00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:07,860
but you didn't do anything to me.

780
00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:11,440
Alright, Lu Lingfeng.

781
00:36:11,950 --> 00:36:13,360
After all, they're outnumbered.

782
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,370
No matter how capable you are,

783
00:36:14,410 --> 00:36:15,720
you can't promise you will survive this,

784
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:16,210
right?

785
00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:17,620
You've heard it just now.

786
00:36:18,150 --> 00:36:19,200
She said

787
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:20,240
she won't cling to you anymore,

788
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:22,140
and won't hinder you and me.

789
00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:24,580
I think we should just leave.

790
00:36:24,860 --> 00:36:27,060
After all, both sides

791
00:36:27,130 --> 00:36:28,060
can leave unscathed.

792
00:36:28,110 --> 00:36:29,510
No one will suffer losses.

793
00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:32,840
Colonel, this...

794
00:36:36,370 --> 00:36:37,580
Let them go.

795
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:43,460
Go!

796
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:50,460
Who's there?

797
00:37:00,010 --> 00:37:01,300
Why are you looking like this?

798
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:02,860
Why are you hiding in here?

799
00:37:03,650 --> 00:37:05,000
I thought you were going to plot against me.

800
00:37:06,740 --> 00:37:07,380
Lu Lingfeng.

801
00:37:07,750 --> 00:37:09,090
Hurry up. Let's go.

802
00:37:16,690 --> 00:37:17,890
Who did you see

803
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:18,700
at the pavilion?

804
00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:20,180
That corvee.

805
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:21,660
He was frightened, his hair were all over his face,

806
00:37:21,850 --> 00:37:22,580
just like a ghost.

807
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:29,390
Look who's there.

808
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:30,340
Yes.

809
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:38,100
Colonel! No one is here.

810
00:37:42,210 --> 00:37:43,250
The men of the world

811
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:45,730
are really good at playing tricks.

812
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:46,920
Bolt the door.

813
00:37:52,330 --> 00:37:53,260
Bring that white horse

814
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:53,930
to me.

815
00:37:55,870 --> 00:37:56,520
What do you mean?

816
00:37:57,820 --> 00:37:59,420
It's a kindness from Miss Xijun.

817
00:37:59,490 --> 00:38:00,730
Don't you understand?

818
00:38:06,220 --> 00:38:06,920
Oh no.

819
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:09,860
Are you worried that

820
00:38:09,940 --> 00:38:11,270
the General will suffer

821
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:12,090
because of his injury?

822
00:38:13,570 --> 00:38:15,110
Then what are you worried about?

823
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:19,830
He is wronged,

824
00:38:19,860 --> 00:38:21,330
and full of grievances.

825
00:38:21,610 --> 00:38:22,720
If this continues,

826
00:38:22,890 --> 00:38:24,500
I'm afraid he'll lose control and kill everyone.

827
00:38:24,650 --> 00:38:26,570
Lu Lingfeng is a guilty person.

828
00:38:26,690 --> 00:38:27,970
Once he kills them all,

829
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:30,110
I'm afraid

830
00:38:30,130 --> 00:38:32,070
there is no turning back for him.

831
00:38:33,940 --> 00:38:35,740
Miss Xijun wants to

832
00:38:35,770 --> 00:38:37,030
use her farther's status

833
00:38:37,150 --> 00:38:38,930
to distract that General Yu

834
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:40,440
so that we can have time

835
00:38:40,460 --> 00:38:41,560
to report him to the government.

836
00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:43,010
Report to the government?

837
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:44,550
How can the officials in here

838
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:46,720
control him?

839
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:48,430
Not in that way.

840
00:38:49,750 --> 00:38:50,630
This Colonel Yu

841
00:38:50,750 --> 00:38:52,320
had already kidnapped

842
00:38:52,350 --> 00:38:53,310
another woman

843
00:38:53,390 --> 00:38:54,910
before he met Miss Xijun.

844
00:38:55,050 --> 00:38:57,410
When he saw Xijun, he was interested in her for her beauty,

845
00:38:57,570 --> 00:38:59,090
and threw that woman

846
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:00,560
off the cliff.

847
00:39:01,130 --> 00:39:02,310
In this broad daylight,

848
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,610
even if he is a high-ranking official,

849
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:05,500
he can't kill people at will.

850
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:06,940
Besides,

851
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:08,630
if we report him to the government,

852
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:11,250
with the officials around,

853
00:39:11,610 --> 00:39:12,980
you, Lu Lingfeng,

854
00:39:13,060 --> 00:39:14,830
may act as the General of the Imperial Guards,

855
00:39:15,090 --> 00:39:16,800
and capture that Colonel Yu alive.

856
00:39:17,540 --> 00:39:18,670
As long as we find

857
00:39:18,690 --> 00:39:20,390
that woman's body,

858
00:39:20,580 --> 00:39:21,260
with the additional fact that

859
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:23,820
he kidnapped Xijun,

860
00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:25,020
he will surely be convicted.

861
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:26,820
I knew

862
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:27,700
it was your idea.

863
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:29,650
But have you ever thought about that

864
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:32,480
we are leaving Xijun at the lion's den?

865
00:39:33,190 --> 00:39:34,350
We, two grown men

866
00:39:34,370 --> 00:39:35,210
sneaked out.

867
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:36,840
What is this?

868
00:39:38,070 --> 00:39:39,420
Who said two?

869
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:41,480
I can ride the horse and report to the government myself.

870
00:39:42,050 --> 00:39:44,010
You shall stay here.

871
00:39:44,270 --> 00:39:45,310
I have discussed it

872
00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:46,300
with Miss Xijun.

873
00:39:46,630 --> 00:39:48,340
She will stay in the left main room,

874
00:39:48,490 --> 00:39:50,560
and the lights in her room won't go off all night.

875
00:39:50,660 --> 00:39:51,580
As long as you see

876
00:39:51,610 --> 00:39:52,680
the light in her room is off,

877
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:54,500
it means Miss Xijun is in danger,

878
00:39:54,540 --> 00:39:55,840
you should then go in and save her immediately.

879
00:39:55,870 --> 00:39:56,580
Understand?

880
00:40:06,940 --> 00:40:07,930
What are you doing?

881
00:40:10,620 --> 00:40:11,820
I need to find myself a weapon.

882
00:40:12,260 --> 00:40:13,100
If they come in,

883
00:40:13,270 --> 00:40:14,350
I'll protect you with my life.

884
00:40:16,620 --> 00:40:17,500
Don't be afraid.

885
00:40:18,060 --> 00:40:19,750
You just need to make sure the candle won't go out.

886
00:40:20,260 --> 00:40:21,390
The General is staying nearby

887
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:22,220
to protect us.

888
00:40:22,870 --> 00:40:23,650
If anything happens,

889
00:40:23,670 --> 00:40:24,830
as long as the candle is out,

890
00:40:24,860 --> 00:40:26,420
he will come up to save us.

891
00:40:28,010 --> 00:40:29,110
The General is still here?

892
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:02,210
How is Miss Xijun?

893
00:41:03,580 --> 00:41:05,340
The light in her room has been on all night.

894
00:41:05,590 --> 00:41:06,020
By the way,

895
00:41:06,670 --> 00:41:08,260
I've taken out all your luggage

896
00:41:08,290 --> 00:41:09,170
and books.

897
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:12,400
[Gantang County, Sheriff Su]

898
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:10,490
Sheriff.

899
00:41:11,090 --> 00:41:12,730
This is the former General, Lu Lingfeng,

900
00:41:12,770 --> 00:41:14,360
I've mentioned earlier.

901
00:41:14,930 --> 00:41:15,600
General,

902
00:41:15,850 --> 00:41:17,020
you can't believe this.

903
00:41:17,750 --> 00:41:20,170
The Sheriff of the Gantang County is also surnamed Su,

904
00:41:20,580 --> 00:41:21,700
he's my relative.

905
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:24,180
General.

906
00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:25,930
Sheriff Su,

907
00:41:26,050 --> 00:41:27,740
let's follow our plan.

908
00:41:30,890 --> 00:41:31,860
Split up.

909
00:42:10,020 --> 00:42:10,680
General.

910
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:11,520
Miss Pei.

911
00:42:11,860 --> 00:42:12,740
How was your night?

912
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:50,060
♫The storm rises with no reason♫

913
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:53,140
♫In the night of illusions♫

914
00:42:54,900 --> 00:42:56,490
♫I go into the maze♫

915
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:03,390
♫In a world of prosperity♫

916
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:06,550
♫A heart burns with obsession♫

917
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:09,550
♫With the darkness rising♫

918
00:43:10,950 --> 00:43:16,600
♫I can't stop wandering through the night♫

919
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:23,540
♫With the light in my heart, I'm not afraid of the storm♫

920
00:43:23,870 --> 00:43:27,590
♫It's because of justice♫

921
00:43:30,340 --> 00:43:36,200
♫That I seek for a truth for this long, lonely night♫

922
00:43:37,020 --> 00:43:42,910
♫The heaven and earth are held together by a strong will♫

♫The people are in peace♫

♫Carving right and wrong into a clear heart♫

♫The truth♫

926

♫Will reinterpret this justice♫

927

♫Even if there is a fog♫

928

♫Even if there are invisible waves♫

929
00:44:06,130 --> 00:44:08,130
♫I'll tell the story of the fate♫

930
00:44:10,220 --> 00:44:14,650
♫Tell the love of the world♫

931

♫For the memory of grace♫

932

♫And the resentment is not over yet♫

933
00:44:22,430 --> 00:44:27,860
♫The rivers and mountains are immortal, the clouds are overturned♫

934
00:44:28,790 --> 00:44:35,000
♫To be consoled by the truth, even with thorns on my back♫

935
00:44:35,320 --> 00:44:39,720
♫Only for justice♫

936

♫That I seek a truth for this long, lonely night♫

944
00:45:21,070 --> 00:45:22,980
♫What is the meaning of life and death?♫

945
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:27,340
♫I'll paint the sunshine into the landscape♫
