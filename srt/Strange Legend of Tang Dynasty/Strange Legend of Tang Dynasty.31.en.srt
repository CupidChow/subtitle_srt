4
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:46,430
Back then,

5
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:47,720
you were very decisive

6
00:01:48,039 --> 00:01:49,479
in front of me.

7
00:01:49,789 --> 00:01:51,220
How can you deserve

8
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:54,350
Her Highness's trust all these years?

9
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:56,660
Gao Zhongyi，

10
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:58,780
you always believe

11
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,210
Huaishen is your man.

12
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:02,560
Crown Prince also thinks

13
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:04,160
Huaishen is his man.

14
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:07,700
So,

15
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:10,190
you are not only making a slight error,

16
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:12,570
but also being blind.

17
00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:13,620
This...

18
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:16,860
Brother Huaishen,

19
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:18,140
since we are such good friends,

20
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:19,860
please say something for me.

21
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:21,440
I am kowtowing to you.

22
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:21,960
Please don't.

23
00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:23,840
You are the Prefectural Governor.

24
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:26,220
I'm just a Minister.

25
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:28,760
I've already put in a good word for you.

26
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:31,160
Her Highness wanted to tear you asunder by five carts at first.

27
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,980
That's too painful.

28
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:34,860
Yes, yes, yes.

29
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:36,530
Finally, Her Highness decided

30
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:38,780
to give each of you

31
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:41,220
a pedal of Face Flower

32
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:42,430
exquisitely made by Resident Regent Li.

33
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:44,520
Apply it on your face，

34
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:45,860
and it'll be all over.

35
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:48,260
Your Highness, please spare my life.

36
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:49,500
Spare my life!

37
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:51,610
Your Highness.

38
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:53,850
Your Highness!

39
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:54,900
Spare my life!

40
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:00,410
Spare my life, Your Highness.

41
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,600
-Wait! -Spare my life!

42
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:05,410
Your Highness,

43
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:07,300
You don't have to do this.

44
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:10,490
I'm punishing the traitor.

45
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:12,330
Say no more.

46
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:14,860
Your Highness, you're trying so hard

47
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:16,950
to make sure all of your men

48
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:18,360
tested and selected.

49
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:19,500
What?

50
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:22,150
Is the storm really coming?

51
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:26,940
I hope you can stand with me

52
00:03:26,990 --> 00:03:28,079
when the storm comes.

53
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:30,850
Gao Zhongyi didn't pass the test.

54
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:32,400
But you passed.

55
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:34,640
I'm touched.

56
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:37,360
In order to test

57
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:39,350
whether they are loyal to you,

58
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:41,520
you took so many innocent lives

59
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:43,480
of young women in Luoyang

60
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:44,590
as the price.

61
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,770
Great things are achieved

62
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:49,300
without regard to trifles.

63
00:03:49,579 --> 00:03:52,450
The lives of our people are not trivial.

64
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:55,090
Your Highness,

65
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,620
if you really become the empress,

66
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:58,270
it will be

67
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,750
the suffering of the world.

68
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:05,410
How dare you say that?

69
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:08,030
Your teacher Di Renjie

70
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:09,560
did his best

71
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:10,850
to assist my mother.

72
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:13,330
With the time passing now,

73
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:15,750
I can understand more and more,

74
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:18,690
how hard it was for my teacher back then.

75
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:21,160
Su Wuming.

76
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:24,120
So you won't help me?

77
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:24,920
Your Highness,

78
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:28,060
the Tang Dynasty can't stand any more trouble.

79
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:30,690
It's against heaven's will

80
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,920
that you try to usurp the throne right now.

81
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:36,380
My brother is the Emperor now.

82
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:37,700
But everyone knows

83
00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:38,930
he is weak.

84
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:40,380
My nephew

85
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:41,740
is still young,

86
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:43,140
and can't  conquer the world.

87
00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:47,130
Only I can make the empire prosper.

88
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:48,830
Besides,

89
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:50,909
how is that against the heaven's will

90
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:53,420
if I only try to restore my mother's empire?

91
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:01,450
Your Highness, please calm down.

92
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:03,070
Please calm down.

93
00:05:03,330 --> 00:05:04,450
You are right.

94
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:08,140
I'd like to propose a toast to you.

95
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:09,610
Please calm down.

96
00:05:14,570 --> 00:05:17,380
Gao Zhongyi sailed with the wind,

97
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:18,770
and had no face to live.

98
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,380
But the assassin who tried to kill Crown Prince

99
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:23,860
is drinking here safe and sound.

100
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:26,240
How ridiculous.

101
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,150
What did you say?

102
00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:30,470
To kill Crown Prince?

103
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:32,540
Who assassinated Crown Prince?

104
00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:35,310
Your Highness can ask

105
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:36,780
your trusted subordinate.

106
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:39,060
Crown Prince has returned to Chang'an.

107
00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:40,890
Who assassinated Crown Prince?

108
00:05:41,530 --> 00:05:42,180
Su Wuming.

109
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:45,070
Don't talk nonsense.

110
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:47,470
What happened?

111
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:49,620
How would I know?

112
00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:51,460
Maybe he knew that he infuriated Your Highness,

113
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:53,000
and he would be beheaded,

114
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:55,470
so he talks nonsense.

115
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:56,260
Your Highness,

116
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:58,570
please take a look.

117
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:02,870
Do you know the person on this painting?

118
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,130
Xin Huaishen.

119
00:06:17,170 --> 00:06:18,620
Isn't the person in the painting

120
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:19,960
you?

121
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:24,100
Why are you wearing a scarf?

122
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:25,110
This...

123
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:26,760
Who painted this?

124
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:28,010
This is painted by my sworn sister,

125
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,640
Pei Xijun.

126
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,450
According to the statement

127
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,130
of Lady Hu Shisi in Paradise Inn,

128
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:36,530
the person on the painting paid  her a fortune

129
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:39,150
to assassinate Crown Prince.

130
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:42,460
Don't make up stories.

131
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:45,840
Minister Xin，

132
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:48,409
your first identity

133
00:06:49,390 --> 00:06:50,940
is Prefectural Governor Gao's man.

134
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:53,620
Second identity is Crown Prince's man.

135
00:06:54,010 --> 00:06:55,470
And third identity is

136
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:57,630
Her Highness's man.

137
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:01,200
You used  Crown Prince's trust in you

138
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:03,510
and learned that Crown Prince didn't return to Chang'an,

139
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:04,970
but stayed in Luoyang

140
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:06,580
to supervise the case of Face Flower.

141
00:07:06,850 --> 00:07:08,930
So you secretly schemed

142
00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:10,330
to assassinate Crown Prince

143
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:12,280
without Her Highness's permission.

144
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:13,630
Xin Huaishen.

145
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:15,280
Am I right?

146
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:18,250
Su Wuming.

147
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,980
Are you telling the truth?

148
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:26,750
Although the painting looks alike,

149
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:30,410
I wouldn't be so sure

150
00:07:31,130 --> 00:07:33,110
if he had no stammer.

151
00:07:34,290 --> 00:07:34,970
Your Highness,

152
00:07:35,590 --> 00:07:36,210
I was just trying to

153
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:39,560
to solve your problems in advance.

154
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:41,470
How dare you!

155
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:43,300
The business between Crown Prince and me

156
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,920
is family business.

157
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:46,510
I can handle it my own way.

158
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:48,800
How dare you assassinate Crown Prince!

159
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:51,580
Where is Crown Prince now?

160
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,100
I've told him

161
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:00,380
that you wanted to see him before your coming demise.

162
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:03,110
He should be

163
00:08:03,130 --> 00:08:04,140
on his way here.

164
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:06,910
How dare you!

165
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:14,110
Aunt.

166
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:16,750
My respect to you, aunt.

167
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:20,810
You really didn't go back to Chang'an?

168
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:22,890
His Highness

169
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,260
worried about Your Highness

170
00:08:24,450 --> 00:08:25,440
so he came back.

171
00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:26,340
Your Highness,

172
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:27,800
the Paradise Inn

173
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:29,080
I told you earlier

174
00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:31,120
is the place dwelled by the Tocharian woman

175
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:33,169
who sells Face Flower.

176
00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:35,289
That place is not only old and shabby,

177
00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:36,980
but also mixed with good and evil people.

178
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:37,909
It's extremely dangerous.

179
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:39,330
Crown Prince only lives there

180
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:40,610
to find clues

181
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:41,880
about Face Flower

182
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:43,740
in order to save Your Highness.

183
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:47,400
Impossible.

184
00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:49,820
Su Wuming.

185
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:51,020
In two hours,

186
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,340
my aunt will die.

187
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:53,560
Did you find the criminal

188
00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:54,440
and get the antidote?

189
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:58,330
Don't worry, Your Highness.

190
00:08:58,670 --> 00:09:00,900
Her Highness is not poisoned by Face Flower.

191
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:02,680
Aunt,

192
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:04,840
what he said is true.

193
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,000
You're fine.

194
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:08,960
That's great.

195
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:10,980
Your Highness,

196
00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:12,370
as you can see,

197
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:15,920
it is a blessing for the world to have such a Crown Prince.

198
00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:18,970
Once Crown Prince rule the world someday,

199
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:20,500
he will create a prosperous era

200
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:21,880
for our Tang Dynasty.

201
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,530
Isn't your conclusion

202
00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:27,310
made too early?

203
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:30,860
Look how hypocritical his smile is.

204
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:33,910
Is it happy or disappointed

205
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,040
deep inside his heart?

206
00:09:35,690 --> 00:09:37,640
I'm afraid only he knows.

207
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:38,670
Aunt,

208
00:09:39,270 --> 00:09:40,910
why are you saying that?

209
00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:42,790
Alright. I' m tired.

210
00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:44,490
Gao Zhongyi and the others

211
00:09:44,530 --> 00:09:45,680
are your people now.

212
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,120
You decide

213
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:48,630
what to do with them.

214
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:50,670
Aunt,

215
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:52,970
there are no people of yours

216
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:54,360
nor people of mine.

217
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:55,900
Only people of Tang Dynasty.

218
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:57,290
What a good speech.

219
00:09:59,330 --> 00:10:00,850
Huaishen, let's go.

220
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:11,330
Why are you laughing?

221
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:14,480
Your Highness,

222
00:10:15,130 --> 00:10:16,650
you can't leave now.

223
00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:23,080
Resident Regent Li.

224
00:10:24,170 --> 00:10:25,000
What did you say?

225
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,340
I say you can't leave now.

226
00:10:31,810 --> 00:10:32,430
Li Yue.

227
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:34,150
What are you doing?

228
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:38,300
I didn't expect

229
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:41,580
even Li Yue became your man.

230
00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:42,670
Aunt,

231
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:44,630
I'm also surprised at

232
00:10:44,830 --> 00:10:45,850
what he just said.

233
00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:47,900
At this point,

234
00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:50,060
why can't you admit it?

235
00:10:51,770 --> 00:10:53,360
Since I can't leave,

236
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:55,360
then I won't leave.

237
00:10:56,130 --> 00:10:57,200
Let's see

238
00:10:57,850 --> 00:10:59,620
what you can do to me.

239
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:05,660
Li Yue, what are you doing?

240
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,000
You just said

241
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:12,740
there are only people of Tang Dynasty.

242
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:13,830
It's wrong.

243
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:16,490
I'm not from the Tang Dynasty.

244
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:18,140
All these years,

245
00:11:18,410 --> 00:11:19,550
I have endured humiliation

246
00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:20,520
just to wait for

247
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:22,170
for this opportunity.

248
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:24,990
You argued

249
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:26,610
who Xin Huaishen works for.

250
00:11:27,050 --> 00:11:28,180
But you don't have any idea that

251
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:29,180
he's my man.

252
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:31,320
Uncle,

253
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:32,720
please give the command.

254
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:34,950
After killing the princess and Crown Prince,

255
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:35,940
there will only be the cowardly emperor

256
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:37,420
left in Chang'an.

257
00:11:37,770 --> 00:11:39,220
Tang Dynasty will be doomed.

258
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:41,760
You despicable traitor.

259
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,160
You only found out today?

260
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:45,290
It's too late.

261
00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:47,490
Do you think what I gave you

262
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:50,080
was a beautiful Face Flower?

263
00:11:50,830 --> 00:11:52,040
Let me tell you.

264
00:11:52,570 --> 00:11:54,400
What you had is no different

265
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:55,700
from what they had on the market.

266
00:11:56,630 --> 00:11:57,870
In two hours,

267
00:11:58,020 --> 00:12:00,190
your face will turn into a skull.

268
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:08,580
Do it!

269
00:12:09,050 --> 00:12:11,220
Kill them all!

270
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:25,750
Your Highness,

271
00:12:25,930 --> 00:12:27,030
please stay here.

272
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:28,090
No matter what happens,

273
00:12:28,130 --> 00:12:28,900
don't come out.

274
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:55,410
Your Highness, don't be afraid.

275
00:12:57,430 --> 00:12:58,120
If we are going to die,

276
00:12:59,150 --> 00:13:01,160
I will die before Your Highness.

277
00:13:10,830 --> 00:13:11,780
Stop! All of You!

278
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:23,010
Li Yue.

279
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:24,300
You let go of my aunt.

280
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:25,400
I'll stay.

281
00:13:25,850 --> 00:13:27,000
You can do whatever you want. How's that?

282
00:13:27,810 --> 00:13:28,870
Why are you doing this?

283
00:13:29,770 --> 00:13:31,550
Lu Dong, don't listen to him.

284
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:32,730
Protect Crown Prince

285
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:33,440
and get out of here.

286
00:13:34,010 --> 00:13:34,940
Her Highness is right.

287
00:13:35,150 --> 00:13:36,670
Your Highness, please leave with me.

288
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:43,140
You are too naive.

289
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:46,030
None of you can leave tonight.

290
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:40,330
Your Highness.

291
00:14:46,770 --> 00:14:47,480
My nephew.

292
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,310
It's my fault.

293
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:23,990
Don't let that traitor escape.

294
00:16:04,370 --> 00:16:05,880
My dear bear, that man

295
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:07,480
and the woman in the room.

296
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:09,330
Kill them both

297
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:11,000
and revenge for me.

298
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:28,540
Lu Lingfeng.

299
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:31,820
The weak part of the bear lies in the nose.

300
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:01,930
Lu Lingfeng.

301
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:03,460
Meteorite Bear is fierce.

302
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:05,230
No one can survive if you continue to fight.

303
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:06,220
Leave me alone.

304
00:17:06,810 --> 00:17:08,000
Take my aunt away!

305
00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:08,960
Your Highness.

306
00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:10,380
This bear is too tall and big.

307
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:12,690
You can't hit its weak part.

308
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:14,319
Take Her Highness away quickly.

309
00:17:15,210 --> 00:17:15,980
Lu Lingfeng.

310
00:17:16,579 --> 00:17:18,220
Have you forgotten

311
00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:20,099
the Ghost Four and bronze devil?

312
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:29,870
Xue Huan.

313
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:30,720
Take the knife.

314
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,360
Stand on my spear.

315
00:17:32,490 --> 00:17:33,470
Attack its weak part.

316
00:18:32,050 --> 00:18:33,030
My dear bear.

317
00:18:41,470 --> 00:18:42,930
In this case,

318
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:45,270
then see you next life.

319
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:52,580
My face.

320
00:18:52,850 --> 00:18:53,680
My face!

321
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:55,160
My face!

322
00:18:56,290 --> 00:18:57,720
My face is so hot.

323
00:18:57,870 --> 00:18:58,600
Lu Lingfeng.

324
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:00,980
Take Her Highness to find Chicken Fed.

325
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:03,390
Check if his medicine is ready.

326
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:04,160
Wait.

327
00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:04,700
Your...

328
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:05,830
What are you waiting for?

329
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:07,510
Save my aunt!

330
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:08,190
Yes.

331
00:19:10,270 --> 00:19:10,820
Your Highness.

332
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:12,120
What is happening to my face?

333
00:19:14,030 --> 00:19:14,960
My face.

334
00:19:23,050 --> 00:19:25,820
[Go to the upper east gate]

335
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:29,250
Master Fed.

336
00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:30,510
Do you want to take a rest?

337
00:19:31,530 --> 00:19:32,730
I'm not tired.

338
00:19:33,410 --> 00:19:34,460
Once you make the antidote,

339
00:19:34,610 --> 00:19:35,580
and save the people of Dongdu,

340
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,620
you will have great merits.

341
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:42,180
Tell me.

342
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:42,840
If I really save Her Highness,

343
00:19:43,330 --> 00:19:44,090
will she award me

344
00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:45,710
a high-rank official?

345
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:46,900
I don't care its rank

346
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:47,960
and I don't care

347
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,590
if it is a formal official or an informal official.

348
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:50,690
I'll take it as long as it is given to me.

349
00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:02,520
Fed, save Her Highness!

350
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:08,360
Her Highness is really here.

351
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:12,030
My face!

352
00:20:13,810 --> 00:20:14,460
My face!

353
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:17,860
My face!

354
00:20:18,210 --> 00:20:19,980
Hold her hand. Don't let her scratch her face.

355
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:20,910
-Xijun. -What's happening to my face?

356
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:21,410
Hold it.

357
00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:23,430
Wait a minute.

358
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:25,010
I'll get the antidote right now.

359
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:26,140
Hold it.

360
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:27,220
Look at my face.

361
00:20:27,410 --> 00:20:28,280
Your Highness!

362
00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:44,110
Ji'er.

363
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:47,890
Are you really my Ji'er?

364
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:54,450
Your...

365
00:20:57,490 --> 00:20:58,380
The medicine is here.

366
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:00,020
The medicine is here.

367
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:01,260
The medicine...

368
00:21:06,370 --> 00:21:08,120
The antidote made by Chicken Fed

369
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:09,550
has successfully detoxified

370
00:21:09,570 --> 00:21:10,780
the poison of Face Flower.

371
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:13,170
Her Highness is getting better.

372
00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:14,980
Dongdu has restored

373
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:16,280
its previous tranquility.

374
00:21:16,930 --> 00:21:19,010
The relationship between Crown Prince and Her Highness

375
00:21:19,170 --> 00:21:21,860
gets better and better.

376
00:21:22,390 --> 00:21:22,880
Stop!

377
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:31,890
Where are you going?

378
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:37,170
Yingtao, let me remind you.

379
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:39,420
I am now

380
00:21:39,490 --> 00:21:40,920
the Administrator of Luozhou.

381
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,150
Don't you have to show me some respect

382
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:44,500
when talking to me?

383
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,160
I don't care.

384
00:21:48,470 --> 00:21:49,710
I'm looking for you

385
00:21:50,090 --> 00:21:50,880
because of your sworn sister.

386
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:52,760
My sworn sister?

387
00:21:55,150 --> 00:21:56,390
My father heard the news

388
00:21:56,860 --> 00:21:57,950
that I was in Dongdu,

389
00:21:58,150 --> 00:21:59,190
so he sent someone to pick me up.

390
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:01,140
The person who came said

391
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:03,480
he missed me a lot over the past year.

392
00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:05,550
He couldn't sleep at night.

393
00:22:06,170 --> 00:22:07,010
He has headaches and

394
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:08,900
his hair turns grey a lot.

395
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:16,030
I can understand and relate that

396
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:19,220
Assistant Minister Pei is missing his daughter.

397
00:22:20,550 --> 00:22:23,330
You want me to go back to Chang' an?

398
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:25,580
Of course.

399
00:22:26,230 --> 00:22:28,110
You have to go back sooner or later.

400
00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:34,270
What?

401
00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:37,470
Are you still worried that

402
00:22:37,490 --> 00:22:39,150
you will never see Lu Lingfeng again?

403
00:22:40,030 --> 00:22:41,400
You worry too much.

404
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:43,380
Lu Lingfeng and Crown Prince

405
00:22:43,410 --> 00:22:44,490
are on good terms as before.

406
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,800
And he made a great contribution this time.

407
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:47,850
I think he'll be called back to Chang'an

408
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:50,020
in a few days.

409
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:52,300
I thought of that.

410
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,480
I'm worried about Xue Huan.

411
00:23:04,390 --> 00:23:06,090
Nice place.

412
00:23:10,810 --> 00:23:12,770
You recovered quite quickly.

413
00:23:13,170 --> 00:23:14,840
All thanks to  Chicken Fed's medicine

414
00:23:15,430 --> 00:23:18,900
and Yingtao's care.

415
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:21,940
You look so happy.

416
00:23:23,450 --> 00:23:24,630
You're an hour late

417
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:26,500
even though I am buying you a drink.

418
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:28,800
Administrator Su is so arrogant.

419
00:23:30,230 --> 00:23:31,070
Please.

420
00:23:32,150 --> 00:23:33,310
There's no rush.

421
00:23:34,130 --> 00:23:35,240
Let me ask you first.

422
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:37,300
Why did you invite me to drink?

423
00:23:38,770 --> 00:23:41,790
Are you going back to Chang'an?

424
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:45,220
So what if it is?

425
00:23:46,210 --> 00:23:47,360
Congratulations.

426
00:23:48,270 --> 00:23:49,390
But there are some things which need to be settled

427
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:51,820
before you leave.

428
00:23:52,490 --> 00:23:53,330
Early this morning,

429
00:23:53,510 --> 00:23:55,150
Regimental Commander Wei sent a message that

430
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:58,250
Her Highness ordered us

431
00:23:58,420 --> 00:24:00,420
to meet her

432
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:01,800
in the Meditation Abode of Blessing Temple this afternoon.

433
00:24:04,170 --> 00:24:05,560
You don't have to go,

434
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:06,380
but I have to.

435
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:07,860
So you must tell me

436
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:09,730
what happened

437
00:24:09,810 --> 00:24:10,820
between you and Her Highness.

438
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:11,830
Or I don't know how to answer her

439
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:12,950
if she asks me.

440
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:19,770
I have no dealings with her.

441
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:25,050
Then who is Ji'er

442
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:25,810
she spoke of?

443
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:31,800
Pei Xijun learned to pass the message.

444
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:34,830
Xijun told me this

445
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:35,980
for your own good.

446
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:39,260
Her Highness is the most powerful woman

447
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:40,760
in Tang.

448
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:43,530
But she is moody.

449
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:46,000
I'm afraid that she will hate out of love.

450
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,370
There's no love.

451
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:56,320
We only have deep hatred.

452
00:24:57,870 --> 00:24:58,720
My parents

453
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:01,120
were killed by her.

454
00:25:01,910 --> 00:25:03,200
If it weren't for Crown Prince,

455
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:04,270
I would never have save her life

456
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:07,390
that day.

457
00:25:09,610 --> 00:25:10,690
I once told you

458
00:25:11,330 --> 00:25:12,490
I was born in Luoyang.

459
00:25:14,250 --> 00:25:15,570
I've never seen my parents since I was young.

460
00:25:16,310 --> 00:25:17,840
I was raised in Serenity Temple

461
00:25:19,150 --> 00:25:20,700
which is called Blessing Temple now.

462
00:25:21,530 --> 00:25:22,280
At that time,

463
00:25:22,950 --> 00:25:24,230
she often dressed as a civilian

464
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:25,420
to visit me.

465
00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:27,200
She brought me

466
00:25:27,230 --> 00:25:28,560
food and clothes.

467
00:25:30,110 --> 00:25:31,800
I've seen her pay the monk.

468
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:34,670
This is the early memory

469
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:35,600
of my life.

470
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,730
So, even though I was an orphan,

471
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:40,580
I had nothing to worry about.

472
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:42,910
At that time, I thought

473
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:44,720
she was very cordial.

474
00:25:46,010 --> 00:25:47,170
And I even thought

475
00:25:49,010 --> 00:25:50,180
if she was my mother.

476
00:25:51,890 --> 00:25:52,930
Until one day,

477
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:55,570
my father showed up.

478
00:25:56,290 --> 00:25:57,350
Your father?

479
00:25:58,140 --> 00:25:59,370
Didn't you just say that...

480
00:25:59,630 --> 00:26:00,180
This man who

481
00:26:00,210 --> 00:26:01,360
I called father

482
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:04,780
was actually my uncle.

483
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:07,360
How old are you?

484
00:26:08,230 --> 00:26:08,950
Five.

485
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:11,860
How about I teach you how to study?

486
00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:12,870
Okay.

487
00:26:13,550 --> 00:26:14,600
Later I found out

488
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:16,520
my uncle only pretended to study in the temple

489
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:17,860
for the exam.

490
00:26:18,210 --> 00:26:20,360
In fact, he wanted to take me away.

491
00:26:21,930 --> 00:26:22,940
He told me the truth

492
00:26:23,690 --> 00:26:24,790
after we were back in Fanyang.

493
00:26:25,550 --> 00:26:26,490
The woman who often came to see me.

494
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:27,490
The so-called aunt

495
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:29,540
is the princess of our dynasty.

496
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:32,730
And she killed my parents.

497
00:26:33,630 --> 00:26:35,120
She raised me in the temple

498
00:26:35,530 --> 00:26:37,370
as a bait

499
00:26:38,730 --> 00:26:41,330
to catch more of my father's accomplices.

500
00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:43,880
Who is your father?

501
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:46,280
When the sound rises, the north wind rises.

502
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:49,100
The sword is strong and the south is flat.

503
00:26:49,610 --> 00:26:51,790
Sobbing makes the mountain collapse.

504
00:26:52,070 --> 00:26:54,620
Reproach makes wind and cloud change colors.

505
00:26:54,970 --> 00:26:57,660
With this, we can defeat the enemy.

506
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:59,970
With this, we'll be able to win.

507
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:04,790
This is a poem made by Luo Bingwang

508
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:06,880
in the name of Li Jing Ye.

509
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:09,440
So,

510
00:27:10,190 --> 00:27:13,100
your father was against Empress Wu Zetian

511
00:27:13,130 --> 00:27:14,130
bace then.

512
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:16,410
The Lu family of Fanyang

513
00:27:16,850 --> 00:27:18,210
has always been protecting the legitimate Tang.

514
00:27:18,670 --> 00:27:19,690
How could he tolerate her usurping the country?

515
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:23,140
[Blessing Temple]

516
00:27:29,110 --> 00:27:31,590
Her Highness asked Administrator Su to come in first.

517
00:27:39,210 --> 00:27:41,320
My greetings, Your Highness.

518
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:50,140
Has he arrived?

519
00:27:51,710 --> 00:27:52,240
Yes.

520
00:27:54,060 --> 00:27:55,280
Do you know why

521
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:56,370
I let you in first?

522
00:27:57,210 --> 00:27:57,650
I don't know.

523
00:27:59,350 --> 00:28:01,000
I don't have the courage to see him.

524
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:03,690
I'm afraid he won't recognize me.

525
00:28:05,230 --> 00:28:05,820
Why did you say he recognizes you,

526
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:09,210
Your Highness?

527
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:11,440
Su Wuming.

528
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:13,340
You surely know

529
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:14,850
I have many children.

530
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:17,440
But the first one

531
00:28:18,170 --> 00:28:19,280
is not with me now.

532
00:28:20,170 --> 00:28:21,210
It's a long story.

533
00:28:22,090 --> 00:28:23,790
That was more than 20 years ago.

534
00:28:24,770 --> 00:28:26,180
I was 19 years old.

535
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:27,960
Mother doted on me.

536
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:29,310
I was also willful.

537
00:28:30,150 --> 00:28:32,540
One day, I went to the riverside

538
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:34,020
in the south of the city.

539
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:54,490
Who are you?

540
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:04,380
Don't move!

541
00:29:05,430 --> 00:29:08,110
The guards wanted to execute him.

542
00:29:09,150 --> 00:29:10,430
I pardoned him.

543
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:13,300
I knew,

544
00:29:14,570 --> 00:29:15,930
I fell in love with him at that moment.

545
00:29:19,690 --> 00:29:20,200
Be carefull.

546
00:29:25,970 --> 00:29:27,050
During the Mid-Autumn Festival that year,

547
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:30,180
the moon in Luoyang was so round.

548
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:31,390
So beautiful.

549
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:33,690
I was

550
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:35,460
so happy and bold.

551
00:29:36,010 --> 00:29:38,040
Finally I didn't come back to Palace.

552
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:40,670
That night,

553
00:29:41,850 --> 00:29:42,870
I got pregnant.

554
00:29:44,180 --> 00:29:44,950
He told me

555
00:29:45,470 --> 00:29:46,490
he's from Caozhou.

556
00:29:47,610 --> 00:29:49,860
He studied in Yi Gate of Luoyang

557
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:51,390
to be an official one day.

558
00:29:52,450 --> 00:29:53,710
I've been to his hut.

559
00:29:54,170 --> 00:29:55,010
But I knew

560
00:29:56,020 --> 00:29:57,250
he didn't tell me

561
00:29:57,290 --> 00:29:58,730
his real identity.

562
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:01,020
I accidentally found

563
00:30:01,610 --> 00:30:02,950
his longsword

564
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:04,500
was engraved with the words

565
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:07,020
"From Li JingYe"

566
00:30:07,530 --> 00:30:09,570
which was hidden in his hut.

567
00:30:11,610 --> 00:30:12,330
I see.

568
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:14,470
The so-called scholar

569
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:15,940
is Li Jing Ye's subordinate.

570
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:19,440
After that, he tried every means

571
00:30:19,830 --> 00:30:21,630
to inquire about my mother's whereabouts.

572
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:24,970
At the time, the Long Gate was opening the cave.

573
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:27,100
My mother often went there.

574
00:30:28,230 --> 00:30:28,920
I know

575
00:30:29,770 --> 00:30:31,570
he was looking for an opportunity to assassinate my mother.

576
00:30:32,570 --> 00:30:33,840
I got angry

577
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:35,780
for he took advantage of me.

578
00:30:36,150 --> 00:30:37,470
So I played along

579
00:30:38,180 --> 00:30:40,750
and asked my mother to capture him at the Long Gate.

580
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:42,910
However,

581
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,070
he didn't blame me

582
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:47,830
after he knew it was planned by me.

583
00:30:48,370 --> 00:30:49,130
But when I realized

584
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:50,280
he didn't blame me because he loved me,

585
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:52,610
he already killed himself.

586
00:30:53,130 --> 00:30:54,130
What's his name?

587
00:30:55,950 --> 00:30:56,840
Yang Guan.

588
00:30:58,570 --> 00:31:00,390
It could not be his real name.

589
00:31:01,990 --> 00:31:02,740
After his death,

590
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:04,450
my mother sent me

591
00:31:04,470 --> 00:31:06,040
outside Luoyang City.

592
00:31:07,090 --> 00:31:08,640
I gave birth to Ji'er there.

593
00:31:09,390 --> 00:31:10,670
Yang Ji?

594
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:13,010
The year after I gave birth to Ji'er

595
00:31:14,050 --> 00:31:15,960
was my happiest time.

596
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:17,890
Until one day,

597
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:19,180
my mother came to visit me and

598
00:31:19,770 --> 00:31:20,570
told me

599
00:31:21,970 --> 00:31:23,480
that she let me give birth to this child,

600
00:31:24,250 --> 00:31:25,010
but she did not allow me

601
00:31:25,030 --> 00:31:26,390
to keep him by my side.

602
00:31:27,910 --> 00:31:28,930
Of course I didn't agree.

603
00:31:29,650 --> 00:31:30,710
I won't leave my

604
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:31,870
child alone

605
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:33,570
unless I die.

606
00:31:34,730 --> 00:31:36,100
Mother still doted on me,

607
00:31:36,590 --> 00:31:37,890
so she compromised in the end.

608
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,910
But she told me to think it through.

609
00:31:42,420 --> 00:31:43,890
But you are a princess.

610
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:46,980
It's indeed troublesome

611
00:31:47,910 --> 00:31:50,220
to have a child before marriage.

612
00:31:50,610 --> 00:31:50,960
No.

613
00:31:51,850 --> 00:31:53,430
Mother told me to think it through，

614
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:56,480
because she hope

615
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:58,260
maybe one day

616
00:31:58,310 --> 00:31:59,540
I can be an Empress

617
00:31:59,860 --> 00:32:01,050
like her.

618
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:03,710
If I carry this child with me,

619
00:32:04,510 --> 00:32:06,600
I will face more doubts.

620
00:32:07,370 --> 00:32:09,410
Empress was using her power

621
00:32:09,430 --> 00:32:10,560
to seduce you.

622
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:12,160
I was having second thoughts

623
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:14,000
at that moment.

624
00:32:15,490 --> 00:32:16,390
I sent Ji'er to Serenity Temple

625
00:32:17,780 --> 00:32:19,690
ruthlessly.

626
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:21,990
From then on,

627
00:32:23,030 --> 00:32:25,100
I would disguise as a civilian

628
00:32:25,210 --> 00:32:26,500
to visit him in the temple each month.

629
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,270
I told Ji'er that

630
00:32:30,650 --> 00:32:31,940
I'm your aunt.

631
00:32:33,210 --> 00:32:34,350
And your mother

632
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:37,590
went far away.

633
00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:41,020
I will never forget that

634
00:32:41,290 --> 00:32:43,380
he looked at me with longing in his eyes.

635
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:47,420
I should have

636
00:32:48,330 --> 00:32:49,430
aborted him

637
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:51,350
instead of abandoning him after his birth.

638
00:32:53,020 --> 00:32:54,190
God punished me

639
00:32:55,310 --> 00:32:55,930
so I lost him

640
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:58,240
finally.

641
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:00,310
Lost him?

642
00:33:00,810 --> 00:33:02,510
It was when he was five years old.

643
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:07,570
Where is Yang Ji?

644
00:33:08,770 --> 00:33:09,850
He was taken away.

645
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:11,290
He was taken away?

646
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:12,810
Who took him away?

647
00:33:14,870 --> 00:33:15,780
Where is my Ji'er?

648
00:33:16,690 --> 00:33:17,470
Where is he?

649
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:18,430
If you can't

650
00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:19,460
find my child,

651
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:21,320
I'll kill all of you!

652
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:24,720
The monk said

653
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:26,550
a scholar

654
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:28,860
has been studying in the temple.

655
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:31,790
He taught these children in the temple

656
00:33:31,830 --> 00:33:33,610
when he was free.

657
00:33:35,050 --> 00:33:37,120
Ji'er was disappeared

658
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:39,130
after the scholar returned to his hometown.

659
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:42,080
I suspect Ji'er went with him.

660
00:33:43,250 --> 00:33:45,410
I sent people to look for him,

661
00:33:46,270 --> 00:33:48,460
and finally it was like looking for a needle in a haystack.

662
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:52,570
After all that I've said,

663
00:33:53,350 --> 00:33:54,900
the point is Lu Lingfeng.

664
00:33:56,460 --> 00:33:57,740
There's a mole

665
00:33:57,780 --> 00:33:58,660
on Ji'er's left palm.

666
00:33:59,810 --> 00:34:01,040
Lu Lingfeng has one too.

667
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:03,900
But Lu Lingfeng

668
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:05,620
was from the Lu family of Fanyang.

669
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:08,860
He is so proud of it.

670
00:34:09,489 --> 00:34:10,630
Those who took Ji'er away

671
00:34:11,050 --> 00:34:12,330
were from YouYan.

672
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:14,610
Right.

673
00:34:15,770 --> 00:34:18,139
Fanyang is in Youyan.

674
00:34:18,630 --> 00:34:20,330
Actually, I asked Lu Lingfeng before.

675
00:34:21,250 --> 00:34:22,550
But his age doesn't match.

676
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:23,710
I suspect

677
00:34:24,250 --> 00:34:25,750
he deliberately concealed his age.

678
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:27,590
It must be the scholar

679
00:34:27,620 --> 00:34:29,290
who took him away.

680
00:34:30,179 --> 00:34:31,960
He told Lu Lingfeng never to recognize me.

681
00:34:35,260 --> 00:34:36,370
Maybe what your father,

682
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:39,810
or your uncle, said

683
00:34:39,830 --> 00:34:41,290
was not

684
00:34:41,370 --> 00:34:42,250
entirely true.

685
00:34:42,679 --> 00:34:43,280
What he said to me

686
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:44,120
is the truth.

687
00:34:44,570 --> 00:34:45,280
My father's name board is

688
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:46,320
in our family ancestral hall.

689
00:34:46,739 --> 00:34:47,860
Every day, my uncle

690
00:34:48,090 --> 00:34:49,730
takes me to kowtow to my father.

691
00:34:50,409 --> 00:34:51,730
My father never got married

692
00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:52,790
because of me.

693
00:34:53,469 --> 00:34:54,080
He said

694
00:34:54,929 --> 00:34:55,659
I, Lu Lingfeng,

695
00:34:56,070 --> 00:34:57,390
will inherit

696
00:34:57,430 --> 00:34:58,260
all the glory of Fan family.

697
00:34:58,580 --> 00:34:59,580
I will be successful

698
00:35:00,250 --> 00:35:01,190
and bring glory to our family.

699
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:02,690
How could such a father

700
00:35:03,170 --> 00:35:04,430
lie to me.

701
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:08,880
What an amazing father.

702
00:35:09,650 --> 00:35:10,590
He changed my age

703
00:35:10,690 --> 00:35:11,490
by two years older

704
00:35:12,590 --> 00:35:14,190
to prevent my enemies from finding me.

705
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:18,240
He is wise.

706
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:20,840
I'll visit him

707
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:22,800
if I have chance to go to Fanyang.

708
00:35:27,370 --> 00:35:27,910
My father

709
00:35:29,340 --> 00:35:30,710
died 5 years ago.

710
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:32,970
Before he died,

711
00:35:33,850 --> 00:35:34,890
he told me I might see the princess again

712
00:35:35,510 --> 00:35:36,620
one day.

713
00:35:37,030 --> 00:35:37,910
He asked me to promise

714
00:35:38,290 --> 00:35:39,890
that no matter what princess says,

715
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:41,690
I can not

716
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:42,910
trust her.

717
00:35:44,180 --> 00:35:45,030
Su Wuming.

718
00:35:45,730 --> 00:35:46,560
What are you thinking?

719
00:35:46,870 --> 00:35:48,100
I'm waiting for your idea.

720
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:49,860
What idea?

721
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:55,090
Today, I will recognize Ji'er.

722
00:35:55,850 --> 00:35:56,770
What do you think?

723
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:57,490
No.

724
00:35:58,230 --> 00:35:58,860
Why?

725
00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:02,660
Since his age doesn't match,

726
00:36:03,230 --> 00:36:04,500
maybe he is not

727
00:36:04,540 --> 00:36:05,480
Yang Ji.

728
00:36:06,220 --> 00:36:07,340
There is a mole on his hand.

729
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:08,830
It's just a coincidence.

730
00:36:09,270 --> 00:36:10,140
How is that possible?

731
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:11,700
Mother and son are connected.

732
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:13,500
That day,

733
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:14,900
I can clearly feel his heartbeat

734
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:16,680
when he was carrying me

735
00:36:16,710 --> 00:36:17,520
or maybe holding me.

736
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,320
That's my son's heartbeat!

737
00:36:19,350 --> 00:36:20,080
But Your Highness,

738
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:22,040
what the Empress said

739
00:36:22,290 --> 00:36:23,010
makes sense.

740
00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:25,100
Although I disagree that

741
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:26,530
you become the second Empress,

742
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:28,540
you are after all a princess,

743
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:30,780
the most powerful woman in Tang.

744
00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:31,820
If you suddenly

745
00:36:31,820 --> 00:36:33,010
have another son,

746
00:36:33,140 --> 00:36:33,910
Think about it.

747
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:36,040
What will the people think of you?

748
00:36:36,070 --> 00:36:37,310
What will the people think

749
00:36:37,330 --> 00:36:38,430
of the Royal Family?

750
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:39,410
I don't care.

751
00:36:42,890 --> 00:36:44,210
If Ji'er acknowledges me,

752
00:36:45,140 --> 00:36:46,930
I would rather give up all my power

753
00:36:47,290 --> 00:36:49,140
and not be the princess of Tang.

754
00:36:49,350 --> 00:36:50,270
But you have to think

755
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:51,740
for Lu Lingfeng.

756
00:36:52,310 --> 00:36:53,230
He has been with me

757
00:36:53,610 --> 00:36:54,760
these days.

758
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:56,310
I know him very well.

759
00:36:56,910 --> 00:36:59,360
He is brave and resourceful,

760
00:36:59,380 --> 00:37:00,500
versed in both literature and martial arts.

761
00:37:00,530 --> 00:37:02,470
He is a man of tremendous promise.

762
00:37:02,970 --> 00:37:05,170
He has always regarded his origin from The Lu family of Fanyang

763
00:37:05,190 --> 00:37:07,030
as his greatest honor.

764
00:37:08,510 --> 00:37:10,500
If you insist on acknowledging him,

765
00:37:10,570 --> 00:37:13,190
it might cause his death.

766
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:16,040
In this world,

767
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:17,950
who dares to kill my son?

768
00:37:18,530 --> 00:37:19,370
Himself.

769
00:37:20,370 --> 00:37:21,420
Have you forgotten

770
00:37:21,860 --> 00:37:23,870
how that scholar Yang Guan

771
00:37:24,550 --> 00:37:25,860
died?

772
00:38:04,550 --> 00:38:06,060
My greetings, Your Highness.

773
00:38:06,330 --> 00:38:07,140
Raise your head.

774
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:13,380
Did I look ugly

775
00:38:13,820 --> 00:38:14,380
when you saved me

776
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:15,740
that day?

777
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:17,650
No.

778
00:38:18,740 --> 00:38:20,150
In life and death,

779
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:22,220
people will talk nonsense

780
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:23,180
because of fear.

781
00:38:23,850 --> 00:38:24,740
But I don't remember

782
00:38:24,770 --> 00:38:25,600
what I said.

783
00:38:26,450 --> 00:38:27,170
Lu Lingfeng.

784
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:28,640
You saved me.

785
00:38:28,990 --> 00:38:29,650
Tell me.

786
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:31,890
How should I repay you?

787
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:34,920
Well...

788
00:38:35,860 --> 00:38:36,880
I heard that

789
00:38:36,910 --> 00:38:37,890
you haven't been promoted yet.

790
00:38:38,510 --> 00:38:40,550
How about I reinstate you?

791
00:38:42,450 --> 00:38:42,930
No.

792
00:38:45,830 --> 00:38:46,390
No?

793
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:48,570
Are you rejecting

794
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:49,640
my kindness?

795
00:38:49,910 --> 00:38:50,340
No.

796
00:38:51,890 --> 00:38:52,970
I deserve

797
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:53,890
to be punished

798
00:38:54,750 --> 00:38:55,780
for the mistakes I made back then.

799
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:58,170
If I get reinstatement  because of my merit,

800
00:38:59,090 --> 00:39:00,710
we need a formal official document from the provincial department.

801
00:39:05,340 --> 00:39:06,860
Su Wuming is right.

802
00:39:07,870 --> 00:39:09,690
You're too prideful.

803
00:39:11,610 --> 00:39:12,700
Are you worried

804
00:39:12,950 --> 00:39:14,750
I'll confer you an informal official?

805
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:18,040
Fine.

806
00:39:18,530 --> 00:39:20,430
I won't interfere with your official.

807
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:23,480
Anyway, you look down apon of the title I give,

808
00:39:24,020 --> 00:39:25,560
because you work for Crown Prince.

809
00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:29,410
How about...

810
00:39:30,260 --> 00:39:31,550
I give you a marriage?

811
00:39:32,970 --> 00:39:35,330
I heard you and Pei Jian’s daughter...

812
00:39:35,630 --> 00:39:36,130
You don't have to.

813
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:38,580
Lu Lingfeng is devoted to the country.

814
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:40,580
I have not considered marriage yet.

815
00:39:42,010 --> 00:39:43,500
You're rejecting my kindness

816
00:39:43,530 --> 00:39:44,960
by refusing me again and again.

817
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:52,270
Your Highness,

818
00:39:54,410 --> 00:39:55,800
I indeed have a request.

819
00:39:57,980 --> 00:39:58,480
Go ahead.

820
00:39:59,170 --> 00:40:00,470
I have a disciple named Xue Huan,

821
00:40:01,590 --> 00:40:02,400
who has been alone since childhood.

822
00:40:03,170 --> 00:40:04,530
Now he learned some martial arts from me,

823
00:40:05,810 --> 00:40:07,170
but he hasn't studied properly.

824
00:40:08,050 --> 00:40:09,370
I want to send him to the Blessing Temple.

825
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:11,410
Please allow me.

826
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:18,500
This is a piece of cake.

827
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:20,290
I'll ask

828
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:21,780
the monks of this temple

829
00:40:21,910 --> 00:40:22,910
to take care of him.

830
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:28,690
Don't you have anything else

831
00:40:29,430 --> 00:40:30,290
to beg me?

832
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:34,820
No.

833
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:39,510
Please take care of yourself

834
00:40:40,710 --> 00:40:42,140
and enjoy your leisure.

835
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:05,320
Master.

836
00:41:11,230 --> 00:41:12,040
Miss.

837
00:41:15,810 --> 00:41:16,540
Sir.

838
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:20,120
You don't want me anymore?

839
00:41:31,650 --> 00:41:32,530
It's not that.

840
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:35,420
I hope my disciple Xue Huan

841
00:41:35,870 --> 00:41:37,260
can become a talented scholar.

842
00:41:37,970 --> 00:41:38,790
One day,

843
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:40,780
you will become a general

844
00:41:40,810 --> 00:41:41,410
like your ancestors.

845
00:41:41,570 --> 00:41:42,240
No!

846
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:44,070
I want to follow Master.

847
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:44,940
Miss,

848
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:46,630
and Mr Su.

849
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:51,300
You just don't want to follow me,

850
00:41:51,330 --> 00:41:52,010
right?

851
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:53,320
Let me tell you.

852
00:41:53,540 --> 00:41:54,200
The three of them

853
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:55,780
will go their separate ways soon.

854
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:57,190
Who do you want to follow?

855
00:41:57,490 --> 00:41:58,540
Think about it.

856
00:41:59,280 --> 00:41:59,740
Fed.

857
00:42:07,150 --> 00:42:07,880
Don't cry.

858
00:42:09,940 --> 00:42:10,560
Do you know

859
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:12,170
where I studied

860
00:42:12,210 --> 00:42:13,220
when I was a kid?

861
00:42:17,970 --> 00:42:19,360
When I was 4 years old,

862
00:42:20,350 --> 00:42:22,360
I studied at Serenity Temple in Dongdu

863
00:42:23,260 --> 00:42:24,980
which is called Blessing Temple now.

864
00:42:27,150 --> 00:42:29,390
There are many schools in Blessing Temple.

865
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:31,160
There are the best teachers

866
00:42:31,190 --> 00:42:32,130
in the world.

867
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:34,320
This is a rare opportunity.

868
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:36,260
It's not difficult for you

869
00:42:36,790 --> 00:42:37,240
to learn martial arts.

870
00:42:37,980 --> 00:42:39,070
But it's hard for you

871
00:42:39,100 --> 00:42:40,210
to get knowledge

872
00:42:41,740 --> 00:42:42,510
like Su Wuming.

873
00:42:43,950 --> 00:42:44,810
Can you make achievements

874
00:42:44,830 --> 00:42:46,070
and

875
00:42:46,580 --> 00:42:48,010
become a real man

876
00:42:48,050 --> 00:42:48,700
in the future?

877
00:42:50,060 --> 00:42:51,570
It's up to your choice today.

878
00:43:05,450 --> 00:43:09,550
♫The storm rises with no reason♫

879
00:43:10,250 --> 00:43:12,630
♫In the night of illusions♫

880
00:43:14,410 --> 00:43:16,000
♫I go into the maze♫

881
00:43:18,230 --> 00:43:22,890
♫In a world of prosperity♫

882
00:43:24,050 --> 00:43:26,070
♫A heart burns with obsession♫

883
00:43:27,090 --> 00:43:29,040
♫With the darkness rising♫

884
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:36,060
♫I can't stop wandering through the night♫

885
00:43:36,900 --> 00:43:43,090
♫With light in my heart, I'm not afraid of the storm♫

886
00:43:43,420 --> 00:43:47,130
♫It's because of justice♫

887
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:55,750
♫That I seek a truth for this long, lonely night♫

888
00:43:56,500 --> 00:44:02,380
♫The heaven and earth are held together by a strong will♫

889
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:05,140
♫The people are in peace♫

890
00:44:05,370 --> 00:44:09,530
♫Carving right and wrong into a clear heart♫

891
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:11,180
♫The truth♫

892
00:44:11,810 --> 00:44:14,880
♫Will reinterpret this justice♫

893
00:44:16,730 --> 00:44:21,020
♫Even if there is fog♫

894
00:44:21,670 --> 00:44:24,030
♫Even if there are invisible waves♫

895
00:44:25,610 --> 00:44:27,610
♫I'll tell the story of the fate♫

896
00:44:29,710 --> 00:44:34,150
♫Tell the love of the world♫

897
00:44:35,430 --> 00:44:37,630
♫For the memory of grace♫

898
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:40,920
♫And the resentment is not yet over♫

899
00:44:41,870 --> 00:44:47,310
♫The rivers and mountains are immortal, the clouds are overturned♫

900
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:54,480
♫To be consoled by the truth, even with thorns on my back♫

901
00:44:54,810 --> 00:44:59,210
♫Only for justice♫

902
00:45:01,190 --> 00:45:07,470
♫That I seek a truth for this long, lonely night♫

903
00:45:07,710 --> 00:45:13,590
♫The heaven and earth are held together by a strong will♫

904
00:45:14,700 --> 00:45:16,760
♫The people are in peace♫

905
00:45:16,790 --> 00:45:21,230
♫Carving right and wrong into a clear heart♫

906
00:45:21,910 --> 00:45:23,280
♫The truth♫

907
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:27,050
♫Will reinterpret this justice♫

908

♫Even if there are a thousand sails, it's not a waste of time♫

909
00:45:33,740 --> 00:45:39,930
♫What I am afraid of is the unrighted wrong♫

910
00:45:40,540 --> 00:45:42,460
♫What is the meaning of life and death?♫

911
00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:46,880
♫I'll paint the sunshine into the landscape♫

912
00:45:47,140 --> 00:45:48,850
♫The spirit of righteousness♫

913
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:52,980
♫Exists for the one I care♫
