1
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:41,519
Aren't you worried at all?

2
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:43,519
Haven't you thought about it at all?

3
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:46,840
Have you thought about it?

4
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:50,239
There are so many midwives in the town.

5
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:53,480
I don't think it's hard to hear.

6
00:01:57,319 --> 00:01:59,200
So because I'm not in Fengxi,

7
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:00,400
How dare you do that?

8
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,159
Right?

9
00:02:02,599 --> 00:02:03,680
Of course not.

10
00:02:04,519 --> 00:02:06,079
Even if you are in Fengxi,

11
00:02:06,439 --> 00:02:07,519
What's there to worry about?

12
00:02:08,599 --> 00:02:10,240
For a group of idle gossips,

13
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,840
And give up solving the problem.

14
00:02:12,439 --> 00:02:14,080
This is not the Lin Yu I know.

15
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,479
At the critical moment,

16
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:17,599
Carry the bricks.

17
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:18,960
A problem solver.

18
00:02:22,919 --> 00:02:24,400
So why should I worry?

19
00:02:26,759 --> 00:02:28,520
You looked so scary just now.

20
00:02:28,759 --> 00:02:29,840
What are you telling me?

21
00:02:31,719 --> 00:02:32,960
I just want to ask

22
00:02:33,879 --> 00:02:35,439
Touch that place today.

23
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,080
Whose idea was it?

24
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:46,479
Xiang Yuan.

25
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,199
It must be Xiang Yuan.

26
00:02:48,759 --> 00:02:50,240
He's a supporting role.

27
00:02:50,479 --> 00:02:51,759
I didn't listen to the director's schedule.

28
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,080
You're trying to steal the show.

29
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:53,919
Look.

30
00:02:54,159 --> 00:02:55,000
Did you get slapped?

31
00:03:04,919 --> 00:03:06,840
I'm the one who gets hurt every time.

32
00:03:07,759 --> 00:03:09,319
An honest person deserves to be bullied.

33
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,400
Welcome

34
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:23,759
Boss, do you have any iced water?

35
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:24,759
The more ice, the better.

36
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,439
There's one in the freezer.

37
00:03:27,439 --> 00:03:28,520
Please find it yourself.

38
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:32,639
Nothing

39
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,520
I can do it myself.

40
00:03:43,159 --> 00:03:45,000
It's finally comfortable.

41
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,520
How much is it, boss?

42
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:03,000
Sorry

43
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:04,240
Two yuan.

44
00:04:05,479 --> 00:04:06,199
Nothing

45
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:08,439
It's just this once.

46
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,479
I was also injured by accident.

47
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,279
Sir, hold on.

48
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:28,839
What's up

49
00:04:28,839 --> 00:04:29,480
Give it to me.

50
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:32,480
I paid the money.

51
00:04:34,519 --> 00:04:35,000
No

52
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,439
You...

53
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:39,279
If you apply it directly to your face, you'll get frostbite.

54
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:41,279
Use this.

55
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,079
microampere

56
00:05:22,959 --> 00:05:25,160
Are you always curious?

57
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,519
In the future.

58
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,879
What kind of person will you be with?

59
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:39,040
I always have a fear.

60
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,720
Is the person you met right?

61
00:05:42,199 --> 00:05:43,839
Will you always be right?

62
00:05:48,519 --> 00:05:49,879
There may be one thing

63
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,199
Can comfort you.

64
00:05:53,079 --> 00:05:54,399
In 1962,

65
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:58,040
The two American mathematicians Gale and Shapley

66
00:05:58,439 --> 00:05:59,439
Proposed

67
00:05:59,439 --> 00:06:02,079
Finding Algorithm Strategies for Stable Marriages

68
00:06:03,639 --> 00:06:05,000
This program proves

69
00:06:05,319 --> 00:06:07,439
If all the men and women on the blind date

70
00:06:07,439 --> 00:06:09,920
I tried every possible option.

71
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:14,279
And you can rate each other in your mind.

72
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,040
In the end, you'll always get

73
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,399
A stable match.

74
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:22,800
And make everyone have their own place.

75
00:06:31,439 --> 00:06:33,160
Maybe I can.

76
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:35,240
Before a person meets true love,

77
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:38,959
There are always some paradoxical twists and turns.

78
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,399
It seems that it's hard for someone

79
00:06:41,399 --> 00:06:43,199
To reach the end of life.

80
00:06:46,879 --> 00:06:49,040
But after the twists and turns,

81
00:06:49,439 --> 00:06:51,319
Who claims to have met true love.

82
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,079
Is it fate?

83
00:06:54,079 --> 00:06:55,519
Will eventually come.

84
00:06:56,759 --> 00:06:58,360
Or after you're tired,

85
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:00,160
And compromise.

86
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,519
I don't know.

87
00:07:04,279 --> 00:07:05,079
Leon

88
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:06,480
I don't know the algorithm.

89
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,959
But I understand something from inside.

90
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:14,079
What is it?

91
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,199
To pursue it.

92
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:20,920
It's better than waiting passively.

93
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,680
And hope for happiness.

94
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,959
Thank you, Wei'an.

95
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,079
The above is

96
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,360
The meaning of the new logo design

97
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,800
Meet the unknown you.

98
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:46,959
Sounds good.

99
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,199
Show him.

100
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:57,639
Boss

101
00:07:58,839 --> 00:08:00,000
Take a closer look.

102
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:00,800
This logo

103
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,199
There's another surprise.

104
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,680
Look at this side face.

105
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,680
Don't you think it's very familiar?

106
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:10,319
Yes

107
00:08:11,279 --> 00:08:12,199
That's it.

108
00:08:13,439 --> 00:08:15,800
This can represent the image of our website.

109
00:08:32,759 --> 00:08:33,559
I've got some ideas.

110
00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:36,440
Yes, there is.

111
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:40,279
But I want your

112
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:42,879
The colorful black satisfaction.

113
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:50,759
You might have to sacrifice it.

114
00:09:46,039 --> 00:09:46,919
I can work overtime.

115
00:09:50,759 --> 00:09:51,679
Is it weird?

116
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:54,519
It's not strange.

117
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,399
I just didn't expect that

118
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:59,320
You even offered to work overtime.

119
00:10:03,639 --> 00:10:04,759
To thank you.

120
00:10:04,759 --> 00:10:06,639
To design the logo for my friend.

121
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,440
The money for the logo design

122
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,639
Has been settled.

123
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,399
Although it's a small fortune,

124
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:19,039
but

125
00:10:19,879 --> 00:10:21,639
We finally opened.

126
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:25,519
I finally have the rent next month.

127
00:10:27,159 --> 00:10:27,799
Chen An'an.

128
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:31,960
we

129
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,960
You're alive again.

130
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:36,120
Is it a logo again?

131
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,840
The senior editor of City Pictorial.

132
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,120
I saw your painting.

133
00:10:40,679 --> 00:10:41,279
This time,

134
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:44,679
It's an illustration of the Scriptures.

135
00:10:45,759 --> 00:10:46,440
Really

136
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:50,879
I have some connections in Wangbei.

137
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:52,360
go

138
00:10:52,519 --> 00:10:53,159
To eat hotpot.

139
00:11:12,159 --> 00:11:12,559
this

140
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:19,159
Didn't you use yours last time?

141
00:11:19,159 --> 00:11:21,320
I bought a new one for you.

142
00:11:23,559 --> 00:11:24,840
No, it's just a simple matter.

143
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,639
Just return the old one to me.

144
00:11:31,799 --> 00:11:34,399
How about I treat you to dinner?

145
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,000
You have to give me a chance.

146
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,399
Let me thank you.

147
00:11:37,399 --> 00:11:37,919
is or isn't

148
00:11:38,919 --> 00:11:39,440
No need.

149
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,399
I have a job.

150
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:41,399
Then I...

151
00:11:42,279 --> 00:11:42,679
Buy them all.

152
00:11:48,519 --> 00:11:48,960
No

153
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,279
You two know each other?

154
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:54,759
I don't know.

155
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,279
You really don't know her?

156
00:11:57,759 --> 00:11:58,799
What look?

157
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,440
Let's get to know each other.

158
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,200
This is Boss Huang.

159
00:12:04,039 --> 00:12:04,919
Zhu Lin

160
00:12:05,559 --> 00:12:06,360
This Xiang Yuan,

161
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:09,200
Hello.

162
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,159
That

163
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,759
Aren't you going to eat later?

164
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:14,840
Let's go together.

165
00:12:18,039 --> 00:12:18,679
a row

166
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:20,080
Let's go together.

167
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,519
In this direction.

168
00:13:29,679 --> 00:13:31,399
Why didn't you answer the phone?

169
00:13:31,879 --> 00:13:32,960
I've been having meetings.

170
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,000
What time is the meeting?

171
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,279
I think you just don't want to answer the phone.

172
00:13:37,759 --> 00:13:38,399
What's wrong?

173
00:13:38,799 --> 00:13:41,000
Why else would I keep calling you?

174
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:43,399
It's okay. I'll hang up.

175
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:46,000
What happened to Zhang Rui?

176
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:47,799
What's going on?

177
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:49,360
I've taken care of it.

178
00:13:49,639 --> 00:13:50,759
It's done.

179
00:13:51,159 --> 00:13:53,360
His parents come here.

180
00:13:53,799 --> 00:13:55,519
You're taking care of it.

181
00:13:55,639 --> 00:13:56,240
Yes?

182
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:57,759
You're embarrassed.

183
00:13:58,039 --> 00:14:00,120
Don't think that

184
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,360
You should be happy.

185
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:03,200
You can't fool anyone but me.

186
00:14:06,039 --> 00:14:07,759
Are you the only one who can lie?

187
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,519
Who am I lying to?

188
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,600
I think you lied to yourself.

189
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:12,879
You lied to yourself.

190
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,159
To get married on time.

191
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,120
It's my own business.

192
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:17,559
I really don't need your help.

193
00:14:17,679 --> 00:14:18,120
Okay?

194
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,399
I'm your father.

195
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,000
I can't control you.

196
00:14:22,759 --> 00:14:23,320
Really?

197
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,720
Then where were you when I should be?

198
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,320
The power is off.

199
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:10,759
Linyu

200
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:14,879
Linyu

201
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:19,159
He hasn't come back yet.

202
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:22,639
The programmer works so hard.

203
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:28,679
It stinks.

204
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,639
There was a blackout and no water.

205
00:16:40,559 --> 00:16:41,919
This is too bad.

206
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,519
I have to bring

207
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:47,919
The smell of hot pot went to bed.

208
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:33,799
Boss

209
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:36,359
What time is it open?

210
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:37,279
Three o'clock.

211
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,240
Then it's 3: 00.

212
00:18:24,079 --> 00:18:24,480
Brothers!

213
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:25,039
Three o'clock soon.

214
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:25,920
We're closing.

215
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:00,039
Boss

216
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,319
Please lend me your computer.

217
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:02,000
I'll leave a message.

218
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:02,440
Soon

219
00:19:02,599 --> 00:19:03,359
Hurry up.

220
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:05,079
I'm going home to sleep after work.

221
00:19:05,079 --> 00:19:05,640
Okay, thank you.

222
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,400
Brother, you still have to say something.

223
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:16,960
Hurry up.

224
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:17,640
One minute.

225
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:24,039
Vivian

226
00:19:24,839 --> 00:19:25,799
Can we meet?

227
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:28,319
Vivian

228
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:29,880
Vivian

229
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:31,599
I'm Leon.

230
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:33,440
If you see

231
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:34,839
Call me back.

232
00:19:36,039 --> 00:19:39,119
The number is 2688733.

233
00:21:01,599 --> 00:21:02,920
black hole

234
00:21:03,599 --> 00:21:05,720
It's time to get up.

235
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:47,279
Linyu

236
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:49,599
It's me.

237
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:52,720
Long time no see

238
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:56,759
Why are you here?

239
00:21:58,440 --> 00:21:59,839
Little turtle.

240
00:21:59,839 --> 00:22:01,440
It's time to eat.

241
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:06,119
Linyu

242
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:07,359
You're back.

243
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:09,759
Yes?

244
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,119
I worked overtime for a whole night.

245
00:22:14,279 --> 00:22:16,200
What evil company?

246
00:22:16,519 --> 00:22:18,000
It's worse than 996.

247
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,359
It's better than my freelancer.

248
00:22:21,119 --> 00:22:21,680
What's up

249
00:22:21,799 --> 00:22:22,559
So excited.

250
00:22:23,119 --> 00:22:24,519
Are you happy?

251
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:27,279
I got a new job.

252
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:28,559
To see Party A today.

253
00:22:30,039 --> 00:22:31,000
Congratulations.

254
00:22:36,359 --> 00:22:38,359
Little turtle.

255
00:22:38,359 --> 00:22:39,720
Have lunch.

256
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:47,880
What happened to your dad?

257
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:54,799
Schedule

258
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,079
What's up

259
00:23:57,799 --> 00:23:58,960
Only cold water.

260
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:01,200
I know.

261
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:12,119
Chen An'an.

262
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:14,759
Why did you turn off the water heater?

263
00:24:15,759 --> 00:24:17,640
The power went out last night.

264
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:19,319
Stop

265
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:21,680
Reboot after the call.

266
00:24:23,119 --> 00:24:25,279
Who knew you had to take a shower in the early morning?

267
00:24:26,359 --> 00:24:28,359
I can't stay with the water heater all night.

268
00:24:28,359 --> 00:24:29,440
Wait for it to come on.

269
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:32,000
At least tell me.

270
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:34,119
Schedule

271
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,839
Please wake up.

272
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:38,079
We're just roommates.

273
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,480
Something unplanned like a blackout

274
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,319
I have no obligation to tell you.

275
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,039
Then why did you make me breakfast?

276
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,200
If you have the backbone,

277
00:24:50,359 --> 00:24:51,720
You can choose not to eat it.

278
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:01,200
You're welcome

279
00:25:02,759 --> 00:25:04,359
I didn't mean to say that.

280
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:06,039
I'm doing this for the sake of our family.

281
00:25:08,839 --> 00:25:09,960
From now on,

282
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:12,519
I'm determined to start living a regular life.

283
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:15,839
At this age,

284
00:25:16,079 --> 00:25:17,200
It's a little late.

285
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:20,880
Because I found out

286
00:25:21,559 --> 00:25:23,759
Staying up late is easy to make people sick.

287
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:30,440
Chen An An.

288
00:25:35,839 --> 00:25:36,599
Thank you.

289
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:39,960
Why?

290
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:44,039
Because every time I feel uncomfortable,

291
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:45,720
I just want to fight with you.

292
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,400
It will be more comfortable.

293
00:25:50,319 --> 00:25:51,519
After the fight,

294
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:52,759
time charge

295
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:25,559
comfortable

296
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,720
The Metropolitan Pictorial.

297
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:30,519
It's the first time

298
00:26:30,519 --> 00:26:32,519
The most influential pictorial magazine.

299
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,480
If your painting can be published on it,

300
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:35,720
I can definitely

301
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:37,359
Soar up into the sky with one start

302
00:26:37,839 --> 00:26:38,920
to win instant success

303
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:40,880
Set the thames a great coup

304
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:43,759
We can then

305
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,680
And become rich overnight.

306
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:48,400
Old Yellow.

307
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:51,160
There's only one way to get rich overnight.

308
00:26:51,839 --> 00:26:53,480
I just didn't wake up overnight.

309
00:26:56,039 --> 00:26:56,880
Alright

310
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:58,680
It's not that exaggerated.

311
00:26:59,119 --> 00:26:59,720
However

312
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:00,880
This is really

313
00:27:01,079 --> 00:27:03,160
Your illustration can reach a new level.

314
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:04,079
Perfect opportunity.

315
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:05,440
You must seize it.

316
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:09,079
It depends on cooperation.

317
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:12,559
Chen An'an.

318
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,119
As the second party,

319
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:16,400
What's our slogan again?

320
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:19,440
Come on.

321
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:20,359
Come on.

322
00:27:24,319 --> 00:27:26,200
As long as the money is available,

323
00:27:26,319 --> 00:27:28,200
I can do anything.

324
00:27:29,519 --> 00:27:30,000
So,

325
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:31,680
I won't care about you.

326
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:33,640
What unreasonable demands?

327
00:27:33,759 --> 00:27:35,039
We only have one answer.

328
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,000
no problem

329
00:27:40,079 --> 00:27:41,880
Who are you?

330
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:50,519
The senior editor of Urban Pictorial.

331
00:27:51,319 --> 00:27:53,519
It is said that he has just been sent back to the north.

332
00:27:54,039 --> 00:27:55,160
In the magazine,

333
00:27:55,759 --> 00:27:57,000
One word is as heavy as nine tripods

334
00:27:58,839 --> 00:27:59,720
Take a look.

335
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:02,920
You will be numb.

336
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:05,279
The Devil.

337
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:26,480
Hello, can I help you?

338
00:28:26,759 --> 00:28:28,440
Double espresso for Arabica.

339
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:29,359
Are you the same?

340
00:28:29,359 --> 00:28:30,240
It's double bitter.

341
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:30,960
it doesn't matter

342
00:28:31,079 --> 00:28:31,960
I'm used to it.

343
00:28:32,079 --> 00:28:33,359
Then I don't have to change mine.

344
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:35,799
I want a glass of water.

345
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:37,160
Okay, please wait a moment.

346
00:28:39,839 --> 00:28:40,960
I didn't expect that

347
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:42,680
You both have the same taste in coffee.

348
00:28:43,119 --> 00:28:44,160
It's fate.

349
00:28:44,359 --> 00:28:45,880
This is a good sign of cooperation.

350
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,519
You haven't introduced yourself yet.

351
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,759
I'm the senior editor of City Pictorial.

352
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:57,279
You can call me Joe.

353
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:58,880
That's what my friends call me.

354
00:28:59,799 --> 00:29:01,160
You're so kind.

355
00:29:02,519 --> 00:29:04,000
People in your position

356
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:06,279
How can I ask you to come here?

357
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:09,160
We should take the initiative to visit.

358
00:29:09,279 --> 00:29:09,920
Right?

359
00:29:11,359 --> 00:29:12,400
Here's the thing, An An.

360
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:14,759
When I saw your painting,

361
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:17,000
I really want to see you in person.

362
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:19,279
Because from your painting,

363
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:20,920
Showing the full feeling.

364
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,480
Really shocked me.

365
00:29:23,319 --> 00:29:25,160
So this time, on behalf of us,

366
00:29:25,359 --> 00:29:27,480
I hope I can work with you on an illustration.

367
00:29:28,319 --> 00:29:30,279
What kind of topic is it about?

368
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:31,799
The City Pictorial

369
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:32,880
Mainly focus on portraying

370
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:35,440
The Life Features and Living Conditions of Contemporary Young People

371
00:29:36,039 --> 00:29:37,519
The contents of this special issue are

372
00:29:37,759 --> 00:29:39,839
Young People in the Internet Age

373
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:42,480
So we want to work with you this time.

374
00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:43,400
Character Illustration

375
00:29:44,039 --> 00:29:45,240
Character Illustration

376
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:49,759
What's wrong with the character?

377
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,880
I've never drawn a character.

378
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:55,519
Nothing

379
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
An'an's illustration range

380
00:29:58,079 --> 00:29:58,960
Very wide.

381
00:29:59,240 --> 00:29:59,720
You can draw it.

382
00:30:00,279 --> 00:30:00,839
You can draw it.

383
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:04,799
Can I ask you a question?

384
00:30:06,319 --> 00:30:09,079
Because I know you just came back from abroad.

385
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:11,240
You've never drawn a figure before.

386
00:30:11,319 --> 00:30:13,880
Or never drew Chinese characters?

387
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:16,720
I started to learn painting.

388
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:18,200
I'm not good at drawing figures.

389
00:30:27,119 --> 00:30:27,640
An'an.

390
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:30,160
Do you want to go out?

391
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:42,400
Besides my own home,

392
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,000
To find someone in the city.

393
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,039
A private space where you can take off your guard.

394
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:47,839
It's too hard.

395
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:51,359
I prefer the outdoors.

396
00:30:52,079 --> 00:30:53,680
The sun and wind

397
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,960
The flowers on the trees and the grass on the ground

398
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:57,759
Rain and snow

399
00:30:58,079 --> 00:30:59,720
Every moment has a different color.

400
00:31:01,759 --> 00:31:03,200
What is this?

401
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:06,640
This is our first time to meet.

402
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,920
Although it's a little abrupt,

403
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:10,359
but

404
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:12,519
In places like cafes,

405
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:15,039
An An, you don't want to talk about what's on your mind.

406
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:19,160
So you want to ask me

407
00:31:19,359 --> 00:31:20,880
Why don't you draw a figure?

408
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:23,039
I'm just curious.

409
00:31:23,759 --> 00:31:24,960
I've seen a lot of artists.

410
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:28,759
Although your technique is not perfect,

411
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:31,559
But you're not interested in

412
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:33,200
For instance

413
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:34,400
A plant.

414
00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:36,000
A building.

415
00:31:36,519 --> 00:31:37,799
Or even food.

416
00:31:38,039 --> 00:31:40,240
The strong emotions you showed

417
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,839
Is very trusted and precious.

418
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:46,319
But there's no figure painting.

419
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:48,319
I think it's a pity.

420
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:51,759
Do I have to draw figures?

421
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:55,440
Yes

422
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:59,119
Besides seeing your talent,

423
00:31:59,759 --> 00:32:01,559
From the perspective of your return,

424
00:32:01,839 --> 00:32:04,519
To show the Chinese in the Internet age.

425
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:06,440
This is what I really value.

426
00:32:08,039 --> 00:32:08,680
An An.

427
00:32:09,559 --> 00:32:10,319
Our pictorial is really

428
00:32:10,319 --> 00:32:11,720
I really need your talent.

429
00:32:12,319 --> 00:32:13,079
And for you,

430
00:32:13,079 --> 00:32:14,480
Is also a good chance.

431
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:16,119
Do you want to have a try?

432
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:23,440
Alright

433
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:25,519
I can only say that

434
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,160
Give it a try.

435
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:30,920
I believe you just met

436
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:32,440
The bottleneck of creation.

437
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:34,920
It's hard to break through your own dilemma.

438
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:36,039
But among them,

439
00:32:36,039 --> 00:32:37,640
There are also great opportunities.

440
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:38,240
Don't you think so?

441
00:32:40,279 --> 00:32:41,559
If you encounter any difficulty,

442
00:32:41,559 --> 00:32:42,440
You came to me.

443
00:32:42,839 --> 00:32:43,680
You can talk to me.

444
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:44,559
Like a friend.

445
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:47,279
good

446
00:32:52,079 --> 00:32:52,880
Linyu

447
00:32:53,799 --> 00:32:54,640
It's been a long time.

448
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:55,880
Are you all right

449
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:58,720
Why did you call me?

450
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:01,079
Don't you care about me?

451
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:04,640
This is the only question I care about.

452
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:09,240
Your favorite station is going off the air.

453
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:12,240
In the chat room,

454
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,160
It's easy to find your name.

455
00:33:14,359 --> 00:33:14,960
Leon

456
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:18,480
So you're always there.

457
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:22,000
Just like we used to go online.

458
00:33:22,839 --> 00:33:24,720
Just observing and speaking.

459
00:33:26,319 --> 00:33:28,160
But I really didn't expect that

460
00:33:28,599 --> 00:33:29,720
You can make

461
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:31,440
And ask everyone to contact you.

462
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:33,319
Such a rash and impulsive thing.

463
00:33:33,759 --> 00:33:35,200
That's why you called.

464
00:33:35,319 --> 00:33:36,599
Are you here to laugh at me?

465
00:33:38,079 --> 00:33:38,880
Linyu

466
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:40,359
I'm just curious.

467
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:42,359
I'm really curious.

468
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:44,599
Wei'an

469
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,440
She actually exists.

470
00:33:46,839 --> 00:33:48,319
And she really showed up.

471
00:33:50,079 --> 00:33:50,839
therefore

472
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:51,920
I want to know

473
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:53,519
What kind of person he is.

474
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:55,599
I don't know.

475
00:33:56,119 --> 00:33:57,319
I'll never know.

476
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:59,680
She didn't call in the end.

477
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:06,920
She probably forgot to read the messages.

478
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:09,599
It doesn't matter.

479
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:12,760
Because I gave my life plan

480
00:34:13,079 --> 00:34:14,679
Until last night.

481
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:16,079
But microampere,

482
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:18,559
Didn't show up.

483
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:21,639
Linyu

484
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:24,599
Your life plan.

485
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:27,000
Nothing has changed?

486
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:29,000
No,

487
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:37,760
Chen An'an.

488
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:40,679
When you become rich,

489
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:43,039
I'll give you a name card.

490
00:34:44,039 --> 00:34:45,760
The four corners are gilded.

491
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,280
Master Yin.

492
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:50,440
My Master Yin agent.

493
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:53,760
Give it to someone.

494
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:57,280
You're really smart.

495
00:34:59,039 --> 00:35:01,280
You can dream of prosperity later.

496
00:35:02,039 --> 00:35:04,360
Let's solve the problem at hand.

497
00:35:05,159 --> 00:35:05,960
Give it a try.

498
00:35:06,639 --> 00:35:08,119
You promised her.

499
00:35:09,159 --> 00:35:10,199
I can't.

500
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:13,320
She's really convincing.

501
00:35:13,519 --> 00:35:15,760
Every word has touched my heart.

502
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:18,360
I can't refuse it even if I want to.

503
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:20,239
I think

504
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:22,599
Although this job is important,

505
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:24,719
But the main reason

506
00:35:25,039 --> 00:35:26,880
Chen An An wanted to draw it.

507
00:35:27,719 --> 00:35:28,400
why

508
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,519
I'm very anxious.

509
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:34,039
Editor Qiao,

510
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:35,599
Is very impressive.

511
00:35:36,039 --> 00:35:37,199
And she's a beauty.

512
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:39,960
What if I do as I used to?

513
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:42,159
I will definitely do whatever she wants.

514
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:45,360
But the Chen An An I know

515
00:35:46,239 --> 00:35:47,760
Is not a man without opinions.

516
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:50,679
She's just a girl who was convinced.

517
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:51,920
Right?

518
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:54,880
That's good, Old Huang.

519
00:35:55,159 --> 00:35:56,960
You've made so much progress recently.

520
00:35:57,559 --> 00:35:58,920
Understanding and trust

521
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:01,440
Is the agent's self-cultivation.

522
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:03,039
good

523
00:36:03,719 --> 00:36:05,000
The Lesser Snow people today

524
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:06,320
It's my treat.

525
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,800
If you get married at 27,

526
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:11,440
There are only a few months left.

527
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:14,199
If you hadn't left,

528
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,679
I won't be so hasty.

529
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:20,679
therefore

530
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:22,440
Are you still blaming me?

531
00:36:24,559 --> 00:36:26,280
Everyone has their own plan.

532
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:28,320
I've never blamed you.

533
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:30,880
Do you still love me?

534
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:39,000
Linyu

535
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:41,639
I look back to the north this time.

536
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:43,719
To marry you.

537
00:36:48,719 --> 00:36:49,960
I'm already on a blind date.

538
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:56,880
But in this world,

539
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,840
Who better to marry than us?

540
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:01,719
sorry

541
00:37:02,039 --> 00:37:03,360
I've been busy recently.

542
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:05,360
I just saw your message online.

543
00:37:06,239 --> 00:37:09,159
But I think we'd better not meet.

544
00:37:13,239 --> 00:37:13,719
good

545
00:37:14,039 --> 00:37:15,800
I hope the previous impulse

546
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,039
I didn't scare you.

547
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:20,599
Leon

548
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:21,639
You're going to

549
00:37:21,719 --> 00:37:24,239
From the online world?

550
00:37:33,559 --> 00:37:33,960
What about you?

551
00:37:39,239 --> 00:37:40,280
When I saw your message,

552
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,079
I just had the idea.

553
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:44,480
Should I log off now?

554
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:46,320
And pretend that it's all the same.

555
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:48,320
Never happened.

556
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:50,599
After all, there's no end without a beginning.

557
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:59,400
But you're still here.

558
00:38:05,559 --> 00:38:07,320
Maybe it's because

559
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:10,039
This is a relationship I've never experienced before. '

560
00:38:10,719 --> 00:38:12,239
Stable and vulnerable.

561
00:38:12,719 --> 00:38:13,880
Close and unfamiliar.

562
00:38:15,079 --> 00:38:17,719
Imagination is stronger than reality.

563
00:38:18,159 --> 00:38:20,920
Just be a stranger who can talk to each other.

564
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:37,199
good

565
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:48,639
Chen An'an.

566
00:38:48,639 --> 00:38:49,400
Why are you looking at me?

567
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:50,480
Look at the front.

568
00:38:50,639 --> 00:38:51,280
Hurry up.

569
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:54,960
What are you urging?

570
00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:57,159
Art is a spark.

571
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:58,840
I don't know which moment

572
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:00,079
Then it burst out.

573
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:01,960
Dare you hurry up?

574
00:39:02,119 --> 00:39:02,880
I've been standing all morning.

575
00:39:03,039 --> 00:39:03,840
What are you talking about?

576
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,039
Hold on.

577
00:39:05,039 --> 00:39:05,480
Don't shake.

578
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:06,239
I'm strong.

579
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:07,400
Look at the front.

580
00:39:07,599 --> 00:39:08,320
to do sth more quickly

581
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:11,239
I'm strong.

582
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:13,320
I'm stubborn.

583
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:14,400
you

584
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:15,840
you

585
00:39:16,039 --> 00:39:17,119
Why are you down?

586
00:39:20,639 --> 00:39:21,960
You're not doing well.

587
00:39:22,199 --> 00:39:23,599
That I'm not good enough?

588
00:39:24,159 --> 00:39:24,880
Stand there.

589
00:39:25,159 --> 00:39:26,039
Why should I stand there?

590
00:39:26,159 --> 00:39:27,239
I'm painting.

591
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:29,519
No

592
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:32,400
Who said what?

593
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:33,719
Why should I sacrifice for art?

594
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:35,960
Dedicated, right?

595
00:39:36,159 --> 00:39:36,880
Dedicated, right?

596
00:39:37,079 --> 00:39:37,639
Come on.

597
00:39:37,639 --> 00:39:38,519
Are you going to give it to me?

598
00:39:38,519 --> 00:39:39,079
Devotion

599
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:39,760
So cheesy.

600
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:42,000
And devoted himself to it.

601
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,079
This is obviously a trap.

602
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:44,719
What can we do?

603
00:39:46,119 --> 00:39:47,159
20 years old.

604
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:49,239
To start an Internet business.

605
00:39:49,519 --> 00:39:52,119
To draw young people in the network age.

606
00:39:52,719 --> 00:39:56,000
You are the only one who is suitable.

607
00:39:58,199 --> 00:39:59,360
You have good taste.

608
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:00,280
That's right.

609
00:40:01,719 --> 00:40:02,800
Why aren't you looking for Lin Yu?

610
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:06,000
That guy has been too busy recently.

611
00:40:06,199 --> 00:40:07,400
Working overtime every day.

612
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:08,599
I can't catch them.

613
00:40:11,039 --> 00:40:11,599
Why?

614
00:40:14,639 --> 00:40:16,079
How about

615
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:17,760
Let's go to another place.

616
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:19,840
Where are you going?

617
00:40:22,039 --> 00:40:22,719
Convenience Store

618
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:29,920
A convenience store.

619
00:40:30,719 --> 00:40:31,639
Is it cool?

620
00:40:35,119 --> 00:40:35,960
No.

621
00:40:39,039 --> 00:40:39,960
Why don't you go?

622
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:43,440
There's no smell of the Internet.

623
00:40:44,639 --> 00:40:45,639
However

624
00:40:46,119 --> 00:40:48,280
You reminded me.

625
00:40:53,079 --> 00:40:53,559
An'an.

626
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,760
Do you really think

627
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,960
Has something to do with the internet you drew?

628
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:03,360
Do you think

629
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:05,199
At my age,

630
00:41:05,599 --> 00:41:08,599
It has something to do with the young man you want to draw.

631
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:49,199
What are you doing?

632
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:50,679
It's none of your business

633
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:54,519
You're such a little girl.
