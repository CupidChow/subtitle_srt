1
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:36,519
This is my first day in Fengxi.

2
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:38,159
According to the destiny schedule,

3
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:39,920
After one minute,

4
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,599
I will bump into the one I was meant to be with.

5
00:01:42,599 --> 00:01:45,159
New horn, new journey.

6
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:48,200
I hope we treasure our golden years.

7
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,079
To live up to Young Jin.

8
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:53,280
Leave a beautiful memory of youth on the campus.

9
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:56,120
To welcome the coming 21st century.

10
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:58,640
Excuse me. Excuse us.

11
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,640
Stop, stop. That's not it.

12
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,400
Make way.

13
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,759
Yes, this is the one.

14
00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:25,400
However

15
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:27,879
My memory must be wrong.

16
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,439
How could I face this cold face?

17
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,639
Showing the stars.

18
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:39,840
you

19
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:40,560
Who are you?

20
00:02:40,639 --> 00:02:41,479
Which class are you from?

21
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,120
Who's your head teacher?

22
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:46,560
It's my first day here.

23
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:47,520
I haven't...

24
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:48,879
There's no class division.

25
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:49,800
There's no class division.

26
00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:51,280
I bumped into the teacher before the class was divided.

27
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,800
I didn't mean to.

28
00:02:54,039 --> 00:02:54,719
Look at this.

29
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,039
The brakes are broken.

30
00:02:56,039 --> 00:02:57,159
I didn't stop.

31
00:02:58,439 --> 00:02:59,080
What do you mean?

32
00:02:59,120 --> 00:02:59,960
It's my fault.

33
00:03:01,039 --> 00:03:02,400
Of course, it's not you.

34
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:04,199
Just blame him.

35
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,000
And blamed him.

36
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,159
I

37
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,000
Look.

38
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,840
If I bumped into you just now,

39
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,280
That's our business.

40
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,199
But you were hiding.

41
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,599
Then I will crash.

42
00:03:14,599 --> 00:03:16,680
Did you hit the teacher?

43
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,639
That's between you two.

44
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,479
Don't you think so?

45
00:03:21,719 --> 00:03:23,240
In this way,

46
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:24,960
It seems that

47
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:27,000
Don't talk nonsense.

48
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:30,599
Mr. Hu.

49
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:31,560
sorry

50
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:32,680
Nothing

51
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:33,719
This is not your business.

52
00:03:34,599 --> 00:03:35,960
Can I go back to class?

53
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:36,800
Can I...

54
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:37,479
Hurry up.

55
00:03:37,479 --> 00:03:39,000
You are the treasure of our school.

56
00:03:39,039 --> 00:03:39,639
Don't be late.

57
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,280
Hurry up.

58
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,000
Classmate

59
00:03:41,439 --> 00:03:42,400
You're already late.

60
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:47,039
Sir, I'm leaving too.

61
00:03:48,199 --> 00:03:48,800
Where are you going?

62
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:49,680
Where are you going?

63
00:03:49,879 --> 00:03:50,639
Class.

64
00:03:51,039 --> 00:03:52,520
This is our business, right?

65
00:03:53,639 --> 00:03:54,319
Take the lollipop off.

66
00:03:54,639 --> 00:03:55,479
Go to the teaching office with me.

67
00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:05,039
Stand up.

68
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:13,319
Mr. Hu.

69
00:04:13,479 --> 00:04:14,800
This is my sister's child.

70
00:04:14,919 --> 00:04:15,719
It's Chen An An.

71
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:17,040
What about your personality?

72
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,000
It's a bit naughty.

73
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:20,160
I'll trouble you from now on.

74
00:04:25,319 --> 00:04:26,560
Director, you're too kind.

75
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:28,240
Chen An'an

76
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,959
It's quite personal.

77
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,399
Please, in the future,

78
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:38,879
Come and be quiet.

79
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,439
Be quiet.

80
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,680
Chen An'an,

81
00:04:45,879 --> 00:04:47,000
From now on,

82
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,480
Chen An'an will join Class 1 Grade 3.

83
00:04:52,879 --> 00:04:53,800
An An.

84
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,160
The seats are full now.

85
00:04:56,439 --> 00:04:57,600
Just sit here.

86
00:04:58,199 --> 00:04:58,800
What?

87
00:04:59,120 --> 00:04:59,720
Aisle

88
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,279
No, sir.

89
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,879
There's a seat here.

90
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,079
I'm sitting here.

91
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:07,199
No.

92
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:10,959
Yes, sir.

93
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,639
I'm sitting here.

94
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,839
Alright then.

95
00:05:18,079 --> 00:05:19,120
Let's continue the class.

96
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:20,160
We meet again.

97
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:20,759
Open your books.

98
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,040
To meet each other.

99
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:24,399
good

100
00:05:25,439 --> 00:05:28,600
Please turn to page 35.

101
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:32,759
New student can do that.

102
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:33,920
Xiang Yuan.

103
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:35,079
ChenAn

104
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:38,079
This is a letter.

105
00:05:39,879 --> 00:05:41,399
Dear Miss Wang,

106
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:48,319
I am having some trouble with my classmates

107
00:05:48,759 --> 00:05:49,959
at the moment

108
00:05:49,959 --> 00:05:50,839
I don't have a pen.

109
00:05:50,839 --> 00:05:51,920
Can you lend me one?

110
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:56,759
well with a boy in my class.

111
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,079
We often do homework together.

112
00:05:59,079 --> 00:05:59,680
Thank you

113
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,279
And we enjoy helping each other

114
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:06,839
we have become really good friends

115
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:13,319
But other students have started gossiping.

116
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:19,240
Okay, this is the article.

117
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:37,160
This city is called Wangbei.

118
00:07:37,879 --> 00:07:40,000
Is my hometown that I have long been apart from.

119
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,399
Eight years ago,

120
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,800
my parents died unexpectedly.

121
00:07:46,279 --> 00:07:48,680
In the rapid decline of the arc of life,

122
00:07:49,879 --> 00:07:51,439
I met that weird

123
00:07:51,959 --> 00:07:53,639
And cold.

124
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:58,279
He's like a flash.

125
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:02,079
Warmed my lonely cold night

126
00:08:13,639 --> 00:08:15,000
At the moment,

127
00:08:15,439 --> 00:08:17,199
I can't find it.

128
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:20,000
A winding arc.

129
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,560
And went back to the beginning.

130
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
The story between me and the boy

131
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,319
Will continue in Wangbei.

132
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:56,879
I don't want my bike.

133
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:57,759
There's no room in the car.

134
00:08:58,039 --> 00:08:59,519
No, I will.

135
00:08:59,679 --> 00:09:00,440
The car can't hold it anymore.

136
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,639
I'm not...

137
00:09:01,639 --> 00:09:02,440
I will.

138
00:09:02,759 --> 00:09:03,879
Listen to me, I'll buy you another one.

139
00:09:03,879 --> 00:09:05,440
No, I will.

140
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,519
Sell this bike to me.

141
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,080
The music is still on.

142
00:09:44,279 --> 00:09:45,399
But there's no one inside.

143
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:13,879
hi

144
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:17,639
hi

145
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,559
I have no idea

146
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,200
No, I want to...

147
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,600
I'm not interested.

148
00:11:31,559 --> 00:11:33,480
The kid is so cool.

149
00:11:37,879 --> 00:11:39,440
What happened to your forehead?

150
00:11:46,159 --> 00:11:46,879
aunt

151
00:11:48,559 --> 00:11:50,159
Call me sister.

152
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,679
When you grow up,

153
00:11:55,879 --> 00:11:58,000
So childish and vulnerable.

154
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:07,799
Yes?

155
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,440
And likes my pink hair.

156
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:11,840
I'm telling you,

157
00:12:12,039 --> 00:12:13,320
When fighting,

158
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:14,919
When people see your hair,

159
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,159
I dare not hit you.

160
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:17,639
Go ahead.

161
00:12:17,639 --> 00:12:18,519
What do you want to do

162
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,879
I just want to rent a house here.

163
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:24,960
shout

164
00:12:27,159 --> 00:12:28,639
This area is in trouble.

165
00:12:28,679 --> 00:12:29,840
Looking for Miss Hua.

166
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:37,440
Miss Hua,

167
00:12:39,159 --> 00:12:40,519
Miss Hua,

168
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,399
Miss Hua,

169
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,399
Miss Hua,

170
00:12:54,279 --> 00:12:55,440
Miss Hua,

171
00:12:57,159 --> 00:12:58,360
Miss Hua,

172
00:13:01,039 --> 00:13:02,240
Miss Hua,

173
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:04,000
Who's here this morning?

174
00:13:05,679 --> 00:13:06,600
To rent a house.

175
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:08,799
Come up.

176
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,120
An and Li.

177
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,879
The neighboring houses around here

178
00:13:41,919 --> 00:13:42,759
It's all my business.

179
00:13:42,759 --> 00:13:43,399
Go ahead.

180
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:44,960
Which one?

181
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:45,720
Pick any one.

182
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:47,559
Number 32.

183
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,200
I want to rent No.32.

184
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,200
Number 32.

185
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:56,159
No, choose another one.

186
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:57,919
Someone rented it on No.32.

187
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,320
I can give you some advice.

188
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:02,960
Don't try to share.

189
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,399
The man

190
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:06,120
He's a pervert.

191
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:08,960
What does he do?

192
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:10,639
I don't know.

193
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:11,799
I think it's for computers.

194
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:13,440
programmer

195
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:15,799
No wonder

196
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,120
Yes?

197
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,600
Is that what you do?

198
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,240
That's not true.

199
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:22,480
Yes, I used to know someone.

200
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:24,039
And a programmer.

201
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,559
None of them are normal.

202
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,639
It's 7: 59.

203
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:35,440
I have one minute to get to work.

204
00:14:35,759 --> 00:14:37,440
I called your house early this morning.

205
00:14:37,879 --> 00:14:38,919
But it's not working time.

206
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:40,240
Director Lin, you aren't answering your phone.

207
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,679
So I waited here.

208
00:14:41,679 --> 00:14:42,639
To confirm in advance.

209
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:44,759
There's a list of products

210
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:45,559
High-level internal meetings

211
00:14:45,559 --> 00:14:47,039
As the director of the technical department,

212
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:48,519
Will you stand by my side or not?

213
00:14:49,759 --> 00:14:50,639
That's it.

214
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
The timing is perfect.

215
00:14:54,559 --> 00:14:56,639
Miss Hua, I'm looking for someone.

216
00:14:56,879 --> 00:14:58,279
I want to leave my luggage here.

217
00:15:02,799 --> 00:15:03,320
Hello

218
00:15:03,919 --> 00:15:04,360
Please ask.

219
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,080
The Youcai Press

220
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:06,879
Is it in the front?

221
00:15:06,879 --> 00:15:07,679
Right in front of this.

222
00:15:07,759 --> 00:15:08,799
Right in front, right?

223
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:09,360
Alright.

224
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,120
Thank you.

225
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:21,639
This is it?

226
00:15:21,679 --> 00:15:22,240
That's right.

227
00:15:23,039 --> 00:15:24,039
Where is Boss Huang?

228
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:24,799
Old Huang.

229
00:15:25,559 --> 00:15:26,399
He's already gone.

230
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:29,600
I heard that people are chasing debts.

231
00:15:29,639 --> 00:15:30,919
Are you sure?

232
00:15:31,159 --> 00:15:32,080
Boss Huang.

233
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:32,919
Boss Huang.

234
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:34,039
What boss?

235
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,799
He's a non-product.

236
00:15:35,919 --> 00:15:37,799
Who specialized in pirating books.

237
00:15:38,039 --> 00:15:39,240
That was half a month ago.

238
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,679
I also received a notice from him.

239
00:15:41,159 --> 00:15:42,559
Are you a writer or a painter?

240
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:43,519
To draw illustrations.

241
00:15:43,559 --> 00:15:44,399
It's not a home.

242
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:46,000
It's all because he wanted to steal your work.

243
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:46,960
A common trick.

244
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:48,679
Boss, let me make a call.

245
00:15:49,679 --> 00:15:51,159
Miss, you're fooled.

246
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,039
Where are we going to catch him?

247
00:15:54,039 --> 00:15:55,120
If I can catch him,

248
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:56,480
I would have asked him for money.

249
00:15:56,799 --> 00:15:59,120
This man was shot to another place.

250
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,000
Now he has disappeared.

251
00:16:01,399 --> 00:16:02,480
I advise you.

252
00:16:02,759 --> 00:16:04,360
Go back to where you came from.

253
00:16:08,279 --> 00:16:09,120
wife's younger sister

254
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:10,039
Chen An'an.

255
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:11,720
Where have you been?

256
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:15,720
I'm here in Wangbei.

257
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,919
It's not easy to go back and forth.

258
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,080
Why are you running back?

259
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,159
Don't worry.

260
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:25,159
I have found a place to live.

261
00:16:26,759 --> 00:16:28,279
It's not my first time here.

262
00:16:28,799 --> 00:16:30,120
What about your work?

263
00:16:31,799 --> 00:16:33,519
It's a good job.

264
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,919
It's a big publishing house.

265
00:16:36,679 --> 00:16:38,000
Boss Huang is also very nice.

266
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:40,240
And paid a high price for the illustrations.

267
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:42,159
Can it be stable?

268
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,600
Auntie, international calls are expensive.

269
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:49,600
Don't worry.

270
00:16:49,679 --> 00:16:51,159
I'll buy a phone in a couple of days.

271
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:52,799
Keep in touch at all times.

272
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:53,559
all right?

273
00:16:57,799 --> 00:16:58,519
That's it?

274
00:16:59,039 --> 00:16:59,679
Bye

275
00:16:59,679 --> 00:17:00,799
My dear aunt.

276
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:02,240
Bye, bye.

277
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,440
Bye

278
00:17:14,839 --> 00:17:16,160
Recently, our company

279
00:17:16,279 --> 00:17:19,200
Is facing a controversy over product routes.

280
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:20,559
One choice?

281
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:22,359
Is a popular portal.

282
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:25,240
Another option is a new search engine.

283
00:17:25,279 --> 00:17:26,200
So Director Lin

284
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,200
Your opinion is very important

285
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,319
Crucial

286
00:17:32,599 --> 00:17:34,400
I'll choose the search engine.

287
00:17:38,039 --> 00:17:38,839
Director Lin.

288
00:17:39,279 --> 00:17:41,240
You promised me to think carefully.

289
00:17:43,279 --> 00:17:44,400
Personally,

290
00:17:44,839 --> 00:17:47,079
This is the result of my careful consideration.

291
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:02,599
I'm an illustrator.

292
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:03,519
There is no future.

293
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:06,279
Are free professionals.

294
00:18:06,519 --> 00:18:07,519
The equivalent yield is too low.

295
00:18:08,119 --> 00:18:09,599
And easy to get along with.

296
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:11,039
The risk of breaking the rules is too high.

297
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,759
I like music as much as you do.

298
00:18:12,759 --> 00:18:13,599
It's a misjudgment.

299
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,279
There's no bad habit.

300
00:18:15,279 --> 00:18:16,440
The lack of evidence

301
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:19,160
It's important for me to live here.

302
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:20,160
It has nothing to do with me.

303
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,440
I hope we can talk about it in person.

304
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:23,640
It's not necessary.

305
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:24,440
refuse

306
00:18:27,519 --> 00:18:28,720
You don't have to rent.

307
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,200
Why all the replies?

308
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:31,759
So mean.

309
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:33,279
metamorphosis

310
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:46,200
That an illustrator has no future?

311
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,640
That illustrators are hard to get along with?

312
00:18:49,759 --> 00:18:50,920
You're right.

313
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,920
I hope you like it.

314
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:00,640
Alright.

315
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:02,400
Now?

316
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:03,599
the next one

317
00:19:09,599 --> 00:19:10,799
I think Director Lin

318
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:13,000
Maybe he's too focused on technology.

319
00:19:13,359 --> 00:19:15,519
Can provide rich content website

320
00:19:15,519 --> 00:19:17,240
To allow people the freedom to choose

321
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:18,319
To enter the Italian sector.

322
00:19:18,319 --> 00:19:18,839
Obviously,

323
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:21,039
It's more suitable for people's online needs.

324
00:19:22,079 --> 00:19:22,960
That's not true.

325
00:19:28,079 --> 00:19:28,680
actually

326
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,519
The so-called portal

327
00:19:31,119 --> 00:19:33,559
It's like a department store full of merchandise.

328
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,599
Basically it can provide

329
00:19:35,599 --> 00:19:36,319
information

330
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:37,440
mailbox

331
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,200
Navigation and so on

332
00:19:39,279 --> 00:19:42,319
The content covers life entertainment sports office

333
00:19:42,319 --> 00:19:43,480
And so on.

334
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:45,240
To put it simply,

335
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:47,720
Is actually what you can do and want to do.

336
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:48,720
It's all done.

337
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:51,400
In an attempt to kill all the target groups.

338
00:19:52,079 --> 00:19:54,680
And tries to get involved in every field.

339
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:55,799
Possibilities and qualifications

340
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:59,160
This is an extremely greedy strategic positioning.

341
00:20:07,599 --> 00:20:09,240
Fortunately, my foot is fine.

342
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:10,720
Otherwise, this account

343
00:20:11,079 --> 00:20:12,240
You have to blame him.

344
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:15,839
I didn't rent it to you, right?

345
00:20:17,519 --> 00:20:18,640
I'm really curious.

346
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,759
Who lives here?

347
00:20:22,079 --> 00:20:23,119
To be honest with you,

348
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,079
Except for a little perverted.

349
00:20:26,119 --> 00:20:27,839
Is actually quite handsome.

350
00:20:29,319 --> 00:20:30,839
What's wrong with being greedy?

351
00:20:31,839 --> 00:20:34,119
Greed is the driving force of the company's development.

352
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:35,759
good

353
00:20:35,799 --> 00:20:36,680
Then boss,

354
00:20:37,079 --> 00:20:38,880
Now in many commodities,

355
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:40,039
And in the unit,

356
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,240
Please choose one.

357
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:43,440
Sports.

358
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:44,359
good

359
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,359
In the sports drawer.

360
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,039
We have volleyball.

361
00:20:48,039 --> 00:20:48,759
football

362
00:20:48,759 --> 00:20:49,359
tennis

363
00:20:49,359 --> 00:20:50,119
I choose football.

364
00:20:51,319 --> 00:20:51,680
good

365
00:20:52,079 --> 00:20:53,279
Here are three news.

366
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:55,880
The Korean-Japanese World Cup is coming soon.

367
00:20:56,519 --> 00:20:58,400
The national football team has made the World Cup for the first time.

368
00:20:58,519 --> 00:21:00,119
And the World Cup winner's prediction.

369
00:21:00,519 --> 00:21:03,599
Of course I chose the national team for the World Cup.

370
00:21:04,039 --> 00:21:05,920
The competitions at the end of last year

371
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,200
It's a kick.

372
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:09,240
It's dangerous.

373
00:21:09,519 --> 00:21:10,880
And you're desperate.

374
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:12,799
sorry

375
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,200
Due to the update of the website,

376
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,359
After you open three drawers,

377
00:21:16,519 --> 00:21:18,279
And found out that the story doesn't exist.

378
00:21:21,359 --> 00:21:23,000
Are you kidding me?

379
00:21:24,119 --> 00:21:25,119
Because in this world,

380
00:21:25,519 --> 00:21:27,440
There has never been a department store

381
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:29,799
Can put all the goods in the world.

382
00:21:30,079 --> 00:21:31,599
To satisfy everyone's needs.

383
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,000
This is the portal.

384
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:36,400
And the one on the left

385
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,119
Is a search engine.

386
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:41,440
Nothing.

387
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:43,759
It's blank.

388
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:45,720
that's right

389
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:46,920
A blank space.

390
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,200
When we face a blank,

391
00:21:50,319 --> 00:21:52,440
Overwhelmed by the complexity of the interface.

392
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:55,880
Is actually the most urgent desire of people at the moment.

393
00:21:56,279 --> 00:21:57,400
And there's nothing.

394
00:21:57,839 --> 00:21:59,359
It's easier to make your goal

395
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:00,960
At this moment,

396
00:22:01,279 --> 00:22:03,039
Apparently floating easily.

397
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:06,519
And get on the search engine express bus.

398
00:22:07,119 --> 00:22:08,480
The so-called link.

399
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,480
This is the future of the internet age.

400
00:22:10,599 --> 00:22:11,720
General trend

401
00:22:20,519 --> 00:22:21,759
Except for No.32,

402
00:22:21,759 --> 00:22:23,319
You can rent everything else.

403
00:22:24,759 --> 00:22:25,720
Let's talk about it.

404
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:27,880
Except for No.32,

405
00:22:28,279 --> 00:22:29,440
I don't want to rent it.

406
00:22:33,279 --> 00:22:34,240
to be a real headache

407
00:23:02,319 --> 00:23:02,880
Miss Hua,

408
00:23:03,319 --> 00:23:04,319
Where did you get this magazine?

409
00:23:05,599 --> 00:23:07,240
I don't know who threw it into the mahjong table.

410
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:09,640
Can you give it to me?

411
00:23:12,359 --> 00:23:14,759
Your little girl likes to watch this.

412
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:17,480
like

413
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,880
I love it so much.

414
00:23:31,279 --> 00:23:31,960
Yes, I have.

415
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:33,720
How many books are left?

416
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:34,680
There are not two.

417
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:35,799
This book

418
00:23:36,279 --> 00:23:37,440
Wiping your ass is too hard.

419
00:23:37,559 --> 00:23:38,599
No one bought it.

420
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:40,519
I'll buy it.

421
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:41,559
How many books?

422
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:45,519
Two yuan for one book.

423
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,319
I want ten thousand copies.

424
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:51,079
You'll have to find Boss Gao.

425
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:53,559
Where can I find him?

426
00:23:55,759 --> 00:23:57,400
You're such a little girl.

427
00:23:58,359 --> 00:24:00,200
You're talking about 10,000 books.

428
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:02,880
You came to rob Wangbei?

429
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,279
Tell me if you have it.

430
00:24:06,599 --> 00:24:07,680
No,

431
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:09,480
Old Huang's book

432
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:10,279
Shut up!

433
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:12,759
What are you talking about?

434
00:24:14,079 --> 00:24:16,240
It's interesting.

435
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:18,400
But I know where there is.

436
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:20,000
say

437
00:24:20,519 --> 00:24:21,680
Let's play a round.

438
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:25,400
Let's play a round.

439
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:13,720
Write it.

440
00:25:14,279 --> 00:25:15,039
address

441
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:29,599
Director Lin.

442
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:30,640
Aren't you going to eat?

443
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:31,559
There's something else.

444
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:32,480
You go first.

445
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:34,079
good

446
00:25:57,319 --> 00:25:58,079
Hello

447
00:25:58,519 --> 00:25:59,319
I want a blind date.

448
00:26:07,759 --> 00:26:09,359
I really can't see Old Huang.

449
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,480
How long has he been running?

450
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:12,160
I really can't.

451
00:26:12,519 --> 00:26:13,640
I really can't.

452
00:26:14,279 --> 00:26:15,039
Alright.

453
00:26:16,319 --> 00:26:17,400
When did you see him?

454
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:18,279
Give it to him.

455
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,000
Tonight,

456
00:26:20,359 --> 00:26:21,480
I'm waiting for him here.

457
00:26:21,519 --> 00:26:22,759
It's overdue.

458
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:27,160
I can't see him.

459
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:28,559
I'm telling you,

460
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:29,799
The money

461
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:31,240
Old Huang can't earn it.

462
00:26:31,559 --> 00:26:32,599
Your printing factory

463
00:26:32,759 --> 00:26:34,440
You won't get a penny.

464
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,440
What are you doing?

465
00:26:50,079 --> 00:26:50,640
Let's go.

466
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:51,319
Treat you to dinner.

467
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:53,039
No.

468
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:54,920
Don't be so ruthless.

469
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:56,880
I have plans tonight.

470
00:26:58,160 --> 00:26:59,960
Brother, when do you have no plan?

471
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:02,319
There's a rare partial lunar eclipse tonight.

472
00:27:02,599 --> 00:27:03,759
I really can't miss it.

473
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:06,039
Today is a special day.

474
00:27:06,039 --> 00:27:06,960
Please save face.

475
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:07,720
all right?

476
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:10,759
Special deep meaning.

477
00:27:10,759 --> 00:27:12,200
It's just something unplanned.

478
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,079
I don't like it.

479
00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:18,599
Lin Yu has graduated from high school for eight years.

480
00:27:19,839 --> 00:27:20,799
I remember.

481
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:22,559
Come on. Have a drink.

482
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:25,240
So you finally

483
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:26,640
I chose to be a search engine.

484
00:27:27,759 --> 00:27:28,359
No

485
00:27:29,079 --> 00:27:30,880
I voted for the portal.

486
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,839
Then why are you talking so reasonably?

487
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:38,240
I just expressed my real opinion.

488
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:40,160
Thinking about

489
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,400
To the other one.

490
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:43,039
What are you doing?

491
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:44,440
money

492
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:48,160
Are you short of money?

493
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:50,599
It's not my money.

494
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:51,839
It's the company's money.

495
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:56,119
Search engine is the trend of the future,

496
00:27:56,319 --> 00:27:58,599
But there is still a lack of a clear path to realization.

497
00:27:59,119 --> 00:28:01,839
This is not a company that is still seeking profits.

498
00:28:01,839 --> 00:28:03,960
Struggling new companies

499
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:05,759
Can carry out.

500
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:07,880
But the consequence of this is that

501
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:10,000
On the Internet and search engines

502
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,000
In the future,

503
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:13,079
The company's name won't appear.

504
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:14,759
Then what do you mean?

505
00:28:14,759 --> 00:28:15,279
you

506
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:16,400
To persuade you for so long.

507
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:17,279
You finally

508
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:20,519
Quit your job and start a business with me.

509
00:28:22,319 --> 00:28:23,880
I've replied to you.

510
00:28:25,359 --> 00:28:27,119
What answer, brother?

511
00:28:27,359 --> 00:28:28,359
My new idea

512
00:28:28,359 --> 00:28:29,400
Shared bikes

513
00:28:31,759 --> 00:28:32,640
Don't try to fool me.

514
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:33,319
I'm telling you,

515
00:28:33,359 --> 00:28:34,799
I went to your house.

516
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,279
There's no sticky note.

517
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:39,400
Shrimp with garlic.

518
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:43,480
Hua Jia Ditch, please give me a portion of celery.

519
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:46,519
And the lung clearing stir-fry.

520
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:48,039
I smoke a lot recently.

521
00:28:48,039 --> 00:28:48,839
Clear the lung.

522
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:51,400
red braised pork

523
00:29:00,759 --> 00:29:01,519
Who are you?

524
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,359
Get to know each other.

525
00:29:04,839 --> 00:29:05,839
I'm Wei An.

526
00:29:09,599 --> 00:29:10,440
Don't worry.

527
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:19,839
Do you remember?

528
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:24,640
what

529
00:29:25,359 --> 00:29:26,720
Are you going to get married?

530
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:27,400
Yes

531
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:31,119
yes

532
00:29:31,759 --> 00:29:33,240
It's written on your schedule.

533
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:34,400
Before his 27th birthday,

534
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:35,279
To get married.

535
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:36,839
But who are you going to marry?

536
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:39,759
I'm 27 years old now.

537
00:29:39,759 --> 00:29:40,880
There are 200 days left.

538
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:42,759
According to my life plan,

539
00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:44,640
To officially launch the second plan.

540
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:45,799
And follow the right path.

541
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,279
Get up.

542
00:29:50,359 --> 00:29:51,359
Right, Boss Huang?

543
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:04,519
Aren't you abroad?

544
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:06,559
Why are you back?

545
00:30:07,359 --> 00:30:09,079
Didn't you send me the notice?

546
00:30:11,599 --> 00:30:12,839
I didn't do that

547
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:15,559
Is this easy?

548
00:30:16,519 --> 00:30:17,079
besides

549
00:30:17,799 --> 00:30:19,680
People are going abroad these days.

550
00:30:20,359 --> 00:30:21,920
Why are you running back?

551
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:24,680
Capitalism doesn't smell good anymore.

552
00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:26,359
Cut the crap.

553
00:30:26,759 --> 00:30:27,440
Pay back the money.

554
00:30:30,519 --> 00:30:31,720
Your Highness.

555
00:30:32,359 --> 00:30:33,720
Can you find me?

556
00:30:33,759 --> 00:30:35,400
You know the situation.

557
00:30:37,559 --> 00:30:40,200
I was cheated this time.

558
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:42,880
I didn't earn a penny.

559
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:45,759
I lost all my assets.

560
00:30:45,759 --> 00:30:47,279
Do you think

561
00:30:47,519 --> 00:30:49,720
I really have no money.

562
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:53,079
Alright, alright.

563
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:56,799
If I call the police,

564
00:30:57,359 --> 00:30:58,319
Let him know.

565
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:00,480
About your underground publication,

566
00:31:02,039 --> 00:31:02,839
Don't.

567
00:31:03,119 --> 00:31:03,920
Your Highness.

568
00:31:05,079 --> 00:31:06,400
I'll give you an IOU, okay?

569
00:31:06,599 --> 00:31:07,880
Why should I believe you?

570
00:31:10,839 --> 00:31:11,519
Wait for me.

571
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:12,960
I won't run.

572
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:17,640
You have the second plan.

573
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:18,920
Yes

574
00:31:19,079 --> 00:31:20,000
And start a blind date.

575
00:31:22,519 --> 00:31:23,119
blind date

576
00:31:23,839 --> 00:31:24,319
Yes

577
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:26,480
And got married within six months.

578
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:27,480
Yes

579
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:33,440
This is it?

580
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:34,599
It's in the mail.

581
00:31:35,359 --> 00:31:36,680
I've been thinking about it abroad for years.

582
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:37,960
dang!

583
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:40,799
I went to several shops before I found it.

584
00:31:44,359 --> 00:31:45,400
I'm telling you,

585
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:46,480
yes

586
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,559
I'm not a good person.

587
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:52,359
I just want to write a serious book.

588
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,599
This is my life dream.

589
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,920
Otherwise, I would have gone to the CD.

590
00:31:58,400 --> 00:31:59,720
It's fast.

591
00:32:01,119 --> 00:32:02,160
So,

592
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:04,359
Why did you send me a notice?

593
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:07,319
I've not only sent you a notice,

594
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:09,400
I'll give every author

595
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:10,440
I've sent a notice.

596
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:12,599
I'm thinking

597
00:32:13,839 --> 00:32:16,440
If the book turns positive,

598
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:19,279
We can work together.

599
00:32:22,519 --> 00:32:23,200
Really

600
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,400
This is the taste.

601
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:43,920
Your Highness.

602
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:49,599
I wrote the IOU for you.

603
00:32:50,599 --> 00:32:51,680
Cut me some slack.

604
00:32:53,119 --> 00:32:56,359
But I called the police.

605
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:58,480
What is it?

606
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,359
It's not too late to run.

607
00:33:05,799 --> 00:33:07,119
I admit that you are the walking schedule.

608
00:33:07,759 --> 00:33:09,640
But this is a wedding.

609
00:33:10,599 --> 00:33:11,400
According to statistics,

610
00:33:11,599 --> 00:33:12,759
Blind date and marriage.

611
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:14,279
It's a high probability event.

612
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:15,759
That's for normal people.

613
00:33:15,759 --> 00:33:17,279
Not a robot like you.

614
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:19,880
impossible

615
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:27,519
If I knew eating alone,

616
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:29,079
To scare him later.

617
00:33:32,359 --> 00:33:33,039
Waitress

618
00:33:35,119 --> 00:33:36,480
The dishes haven't been served yet.

619
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:38,000
Can you help me return the dishes?

620
00:33:38,319 --> 00:33:40,200
Sorry, we've cooked this dish.

621
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:40,960
You can't return it.

622
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:41,880
I'm not urging the dishes.

623
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:43,000
I'm returning the vegetables.

624
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:45,480
Sorry, I can't return it.

625
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:49,480
Do you have guests who can share the table?

626
00:33:49,799 --> 00:33:52,119
I think you're the only one

627
00:33:53,079 --> 00:33:54,759
Can you sit down?

628
00:33:54,759 --> 00:33:56,000
To have dinner with me?

629
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,119
What do you think?

630
00:33:58,640 --> 00:33:59,160
Alright

631
00:33:59,400 --> 00:33:59,880
Bye

632
00:34:00,599 --> 00:34:01,440
Brother,

633
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:03,079
When I talk to you,

634
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:05,400
Can you listen to me?

635
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:07,039
Are you going to fight with me?

636
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:11,440
Brother, I'm not trying to fight with you.

637
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:13,159
I'm persuading you patiently.

638
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:15,480
To roll up your sleeves?

639
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,039
I told you I wouldn't wear this.

640
00:34:18,039 --> 00:34:19,360
If it wasn't for the job,

641
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:20,480
I'm not wearing this.

642
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:21,960
eldest brother

643
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:24,079
Marriage is different from being in a relationship.

644
00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:25,119
What do you mean by following the schedule?

645
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:25,719
Why are you here?

646
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:26,840
Who?

647
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:28,000
Don't fight.

648
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:28,760
I'll do it.

649
00:34:29,039 --> 00:34:29,519
I'll do it.

650
00:34:31,239 --> 00:34:32,280
I'll share the table.

651
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:41,360
Linyu

652
00:34:41,719 --> 00:34:43,880
To the direction.

653
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:44,480
Xiang Yuan.

654
00:34:44,559 --> 00:34:45,159
Who is that?

655
00:34:45,519 --> 00:34:46,159
Chen An'an.

656
00:34:47,519 --> 00:34:49,760
Do you always have to be so special?

657
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:52,840
Eight years.

658
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:54,960
Say hello to your old deskmate.

659
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,559
Still so cold.

660
00:34:56,599 --> 00:34:57,320
It's boring.

661
00:34:58,079 --> 00:34:58,840
Chen An'an.

662
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:00,639
Xiang Yuan.

663
00:35:00,679 --> 00:35:01,360
You're so handsome.

664
00:35:02,159 --> 00:35:02,679
sit

665
00:35:03,079 --> 00:35:04,280
Where have you been for eight years?

666
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:06,760
Eight years.

667
00:35:07,039 --> 00:35:08,880
The way of finding people to share the table is still so stiff.

668
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:12,000
I've never lost.

669
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:14,440
That means there are many good people.

670
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,239
People like you

671
00:35:16,239 --> 00:35:17,480
It's not much.

672
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:19,000
Alright, you two.

673
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:19,679
What are you doing?

674
00:35:19,679 --> 00:35:20,400
Eight years.

675
00:35:21,159 --> 00:35:22,440
It's been eight years.

676
00:35:22,639 --> 00:35:23,480
When we met,

677
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:24,599
You two are playing mahjong.

678
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:25,599
We'll start the battle.

679
00:35:26,199 --> 00:35:26,599
Linyu

680
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:29,280
You chose the right major.

681
00:35:29,519 --> 00:35:30,679
programmer

682
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,400
Are the same perverts.

683
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:34,920
Liberal professions

684
00:35:35,079 --> 00:35:37,000
In the public security bureau,

685
00:35:37,239 --> 00:35:38,679
Call the social idlers.

686
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:42,400
He...

687
00:35:42,599 --> 00:35:43,800
Ignore him.

688
00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:45,360
Don't you know what kind of person he is?

689
00:35:46,639 --> 00:35:47,920
This guy poked a lung tube.

690
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,159
No one dares to count.

691
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:50,639
I think so.

692
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:52,880
Do you know what day it is?

693
00:35:53,559 --> 00:35:55,039
Today is our high school graduation.

694
00:35:55,039 --> 00:35:56,400
The eighth anniversary.

695
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:57,639
What about

696
00:35:57,639 --> 00:35:58,480
Should we celebrate?

697
00:35:59,519 --> 00:36:00,119
drink

698
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:04,159
We need to celebrate Chen An'an's return.

699
00:36:04,559 --> 00:36:05,119
Can I drink it?

700
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:06,119
can

701
00:36:06,559 --> 00:36:07,599
Who are you afraid of?

702
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:08,840
Serve the wine.

703
00:36:13,239 --> 00:36:14,360
Take it easy.

704
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:15,599
Breathe.

705
00:36:16,199 --> 00:36:16,840
We haven't seen each other for so many years.

706
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:17,280
It's so hot.

707
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,400
You can still drink.

708
00:36:18,719 --> 00:36:19,400
No, no.

709
00:36:19,519 --> 00:36:20,119
Chen An'an.

710
00:36:20,679 --> 00:36:21,760
Here, leave your number.

711
00:36:22,239 --> 00:36:23,039
I just came back.

712
00:36:23,079 --> 00:36:24,360
I haven't bought a phone yet.

713
00:36:26,159 --> 00:36:26,719
Nothing

714
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:27,639
I have a plan.

715
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:28,800
What kind of move?

716
00:36:29,159 --> 00:36:30,039
I'm telling you,

717
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:30,880
What about me?

718
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:32,119
I brought a notebook with me.

719
00:36:33,079 --> 00:36:34,239
My phone number

720
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:35,320
I'll write it down for you.

721
00:36:35,719 --> 00:36:36,360
a row

722
00:36:36,559 --> 00:36:38,000
You can always come to me.

723
00:36:42,639 --> 00:36:43,159
Your

724
00:36:43,639 --> 00:36:45,599
No, I just need to find you.

725
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:49,119
argumentative

726
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:49,880
come

727
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:52,000
Remember,

728
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,400
Call me if you need help.

729
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:55,559
Alright.

730
00:36:56,079 --> 00:36:57,159
How are you? Where are you staying?

731
00:36:57,159 --> 00:36:57,880
Let's get you home.

732
00:36:59,199 --> 00:37:00,719
I'll stay in the hotel temporarily.

733
00:37:01,199 --> 00:37:03,079
I'll tell you when I find a house.

734
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:04,519
How about a hotel?

735
00:37:04,679 --> 00:37:05,599
Go back alone at night.

736
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:06,400
Isn't it safe?

737
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:07,360
We'll send you back.

738
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:08,880
No, no.

739
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:10,320
I'll just go back myself.

740
00:37:10,559 --> 00:37:11,320
The bus.

741
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:12,719
The last bus.

742
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:17,079
I'm too late.

743
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:18,360
Alright, alright.

744
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:19,920
Contact me anytime.

745
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:21,239
Bye, bye.

746
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:37,599
Jet lag and beer

747
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:39,280
Can we still find the hotel?

748
00:37:41,039 --> 00:37:44,079
It's hard to separate day and night, and I'm drunk.

749
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:47,760
This is the way to go back to home.

750
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:51,599
As far as I know,

751
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:54,280
There's not much demand for illustrators in Wangbei.

752
00:37:55,199 --> 00:37:56,880
I suggest you find another job.

753
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:02,800
So you're being stubborn.

754
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:04,840
But soft heart?

755
00:38:06,639 --> 00:38:08,559
This is advice from adults.

756
00:38:10,239 --> 00:38:11,199
Thank you.

757
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,440
Old schoolmate.

758
00:38:18,239 --> 00:38:19,880
Do you need me to escort you back to the hotel?

759
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:22,119
No, no.

760
00:38:22,239 --> 00:38:23,440
I'll go back myself.

761
00:38:26,199 --> 00:38:26,599
good

762
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:27,719
I'll leave now.

763
00:38:37,039 --> 00:38:39,840
I lost again.

764
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:19,440
The painting is good.

765
00:39:20,119 --> 00:39:21,000
The writing is too ugly.

766
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:56,760
Although I can't live in An He Li, No.32,

767
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:58,800
But the Ferris wheel is still there.

768
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:02,199
I wish I could live here.

769
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:06,199
But I can only say goodbye to you.

770
00:40:11,199 --> 00:40:12,400
This pervert.

771
00:40:12,599 --> 00:40:14,079
I have to pay him a visit.

772
00:40:27,559 --> 00:40:28,360
aunt

773
00:40:29,719 --> 00:40:31,559
Call me sister.

774
00:40:32,039 --> 00:40:32,880
let it be

775
00:40:33,039 --> 00:40:34,159
Call whatever you like.

776
00:40:37,079 --> 00:40:38,119
You live here?

777
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:40,360
Miss Hua is my mother.

778
00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:45,800
Tell Miss Hua.

779
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,119
I've taken the luggage.

780
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:49,079
aunt

781
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:50,880
You're not going to stay here?

782
00:40:52,679 --> 00:40:55,000
To handle the No.32.

783
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:58,119
Weirdo

784
00:40:58,679 --> 00:41:01,159
Anyway, I was angry during the day.

785
00:41:01,719 --> 00:41:02,320
It's worth it.

786
00:41:09,519 --> 00:41:10,840
Just touch it if you like.

787
00:41:17,519 --> 00:41:18,239
Alright.

788
00:41:18,559 --> 00:41:19,280
Let's go.

789
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:21,360
Goodbye, Jianghu.

790
00:41:25,519 --> 00:41:26,159
Bye
