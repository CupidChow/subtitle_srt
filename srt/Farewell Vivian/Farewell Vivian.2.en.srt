1
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,199
So you're the pervert.

2
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:18,759
So you're the one

3
00:02:18,759 --> 00:02:20,759
A tenant who glorifies himself too much.

4
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,439
And grumpy.

5
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,879
If you can't rent a house, you still want to attack me.

6
00:02:27,159 --> 00:02:30,280
I'm returning the favor.

7
00:02:32,199 --> 00:02:34,039
Is it personal to deny someone?

8
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,719
Look at the content of the above.

9
00:02:39,719 --> 00:02:41,439
Which one is not personal?

10
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,280
This is for Xiang Yuan.

11
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,800
You've claimed.

12
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,240
Can't be considered personal attacks.

13
00:02:54,439 --> 00:02:55,759
What did you write to me?

14
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,560
It will be easier.

15
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:03,719
There are no words.

16
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,360
I really don't understand.

17
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,680
Why do you have to live here?

18
00:03:16,039 --> 00:03:17,639
And I'm sharing with a man.

19
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
because

20
00:03:23,439 --> 00:03:25,120
Because it's No.32.

21
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:26,840
My lucky number.

22
00:03:27,319 --> 00:03:28,680
I'm going to live here anyway.

23
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:30,719
Besides,

24
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:33,680
I'm not afraid of sharing a room with a girl.

25
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,800
What are you worrying about?

26
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:38,719
But,

27
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:39,360
sorry

28
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,840
I really don't have a plan to share a house.

29
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:42,919
have never

30
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:46,960
You didn't have a plan before.

31
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,639
There's a deskmate.

32
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:53,879
Lin Yu.

33
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,520
Read the text to everyone.

34
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:01,599
teacher

35
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,199
This is a dialogue.

36
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,280
I want to invite a classmate.

37
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:06,800
Read it with me.

38
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,080
Alright.

39
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:09,840
Everyone is practicing oral English.

40
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:11,319
Who are you looking for?

41
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,800
How about the new one?

42
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:28,319
Chen An'an.

43
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:30,959
Chen An'an.

44
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:35,759
Read the text.

45
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:38,079
And you.

46
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,519
I'll sleep in class.

47
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,639
You're so shady.

48
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,759
Do you want any more books?
You want more books?

49
00:04:48,199 --> 00:04:50,639
More than I can even get.
More than I can get.

50
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:55,040
The money will give you some.
The money is enough for you to buy some.

51
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:58,199
May I buy what I want with it？
Can I buy what I want with it?

52
00:04:59,319 --> 00:05:01,560
Yes, whatever you want.
Yes, whatever you want,

53
00:05:05,879 --> 00:05:07,040
Sorry.

54
00:05:07,279 --> 00:05:09,560
Your prank failed.

55
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:14,079
Why do you insist on sharing my desk?

56
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,439
I don't want to sit alone.

57
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,199
It's boring to sit alone.

58
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,079
Men and women are not allowed to marry.

59
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:22,720
You're a girl.

60
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:24,279
You insisted on sitting next to me.

61
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,160
And you don't want to marry each other.

62
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,279
I don't care about any girl.

63
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,240
The man is hypocritical.

64
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,600
In my plan,

65
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,519
Will never exist.

66
00:05:36,759 --> 00:05:38,120
That's easy.

67
00:05:38,319 --> 00:05:41,439
I can write your deskmate into the plan.

68
00:05:45,319 --> 00:05:46,160
You know what?

69
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,439
You have a new recklessness.

70
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,680
You know what?

71
00:05:52,079 --> 00:05:53,319
The real courage.

72
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:56,720
Between extreme timidity and recklessness,

73
00:05:57,839 --> 00:05:58,639
know

74
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,279
Miss Knight.

75
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:04,279
Chen An, Lin Yu.

76
00:06:04,279 --> 00:06:04,959
What are you talking about?

77
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,079
Cervantes

78
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:11,600
Certes what?

79
00:06:12,759 --> 00:06:13,720
You know a lot.

80
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:16,639
I don't understand.

81
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:19,399
I'd rather read my Chinese literature.

82
00:06:19,959 --> 00:06:20,439
An'an.

83
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,319
I'm telling you,

84
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:23,160
What is this?

85
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:32,879
It's quiet.

86
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:36,519
Xiang Yuan.

87
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,600
Why don't you and Chen An'an change seats?

88
00:06:40,519 --> 00:06:40,920
Don't change it.

89
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:41,519
I won't change it.

90
00:06:46,759 --> 00:06:47,480
Are you sure?

91
00:06:50,519 --> 00:06:53,120
Anyway, I don't need it.

92
00:06:53,519 --> 00:06:54,879
When she's not using it,

93
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:00,839
a row

94
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,319
You can negotiate on your own.

95
00:07:02,519 --> 00:07:03,759
Okay, let's go to class.

96
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,800
You changed your mind?

97
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,040
Are you sure?

98
00:07:12,279 --> 00:07:13,920
Waiting for you to leave.

99
00:07:18,959 --> 00:07:20,000
Are you sure you won't change it?

100
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,800
I'm waiting for you to beg me to stay.

101
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,759
Be my deskmate.

102
00:07:30,519 --> 00:07:31,839
You might regret it.

103
00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:33,639
regret

104
00:07:34,279 --> 00:07:35,319
What regret?

105
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,480
I'll give you one last chance.

106
00:07:41,399 --> 00:07:42,360
Are you sure?

107
00:07:45,079 --> 00:07:47,040
You're so sure.

108
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:27,120
I haven't sent my old schoolmate

109
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,360
Throw it out the door.

110
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:31,480
But threw her on the couch.

111
00:08:31,959 --> 00:08:33,519
And covered it with a blanket.

112
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,440
Should I thank you?

113
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:37,480
You're welcome

114
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,960
Although he's an old classmate who has been apart for a long time,

115
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:46,120
But I also want you to fold it.

116
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,480
It's a hot day.

117
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,120
Aren't you afraid that I will cover up the prickly heat?

118
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,279
I was afraid that you might catch a cold.

119
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,919
Your sudden concern

120
00:08:58,919 --> 00:09:00,480
But it scares me.

121
00:09:01,679 --> 00:09:02,799
I mean,

122
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:04,759
Cold bacteria

123
00:09:04,759 --> 00:09:06,360
At the right temperature and humidity,

124
00:09:06,759 --> 00:09:08,799
Can survive for two to three hours at most.

125
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:10,759
And the time for the body to heal itself

126
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:12,080
At least a week.

127
00:09:12,639 --> 00:09:14,879
And the virus with an incubation period is highly infectious.

128
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,519
But the prickly heat won't.

129
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:18,440
For the safety of my family,

130
00:09:19,039 --> 00:09:20,320
The virus and the blanket

131
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,639
Of course I choose the blanket.

132
00:09:22,759 --> 00:09:25,519
As usual, you still don't care about human relations.

133
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,240
Schedule

134
00:09:49,759 --> 00:09:50,840
What does that mean?

135
00:09:55,559 --> 00:09:56,320
Literally.

136
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,039
Literal

137
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,759
Fhjfhfhgfjfgjfghjfh

138
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:05,480
You mean what you think.

139
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,480
What I want to say,

140
00:10:13,039 --> 00:10:13,840
Schedule

141
00:10:14,279 --> 00:10:15,879
You're too kind.

142
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:36,960
Why?

143
00:10:38,519 --> 00:10:39,360
After you sign it,

144
00:10:39,679 --> 00:10:41,360
Our contract is officially effective.

145
00:10:45,679 --> 00:10:47,360
You really agree to rent with me?

146
00:10:49,559 --> 00:10:51,000
How about these two contracts

147
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,360
For what?

148
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:55,120
You don't have to be so serious.

149
00:10:55,799 --> 00:10:57,159
I suggest you take a look.

150
00:10:59,919 --> 00:11:01,080
to feel relieved

151
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,840
Don't I worry about your work?

152
00:11:13,879 --> 00:11:15,120
You are short of money.

153
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:18,039
Who are you competing with?

154
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:21,799
I knew it.

155
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:25,320
So this is the real purpose of your sharing.

156
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,120
What do you mean?

157
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,519
I'll rent a second bedroom.

158
00:11:30,879 --> 00:11:32,360
To pay half the rent.

159
00:11:34,559 --> 00:11:36,080
It seems that I have reserved more than 20 minutes for you.

160
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,360
Is completely correct.

161
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:39,960
Now I'm so close to

162
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:40,960
Fifteen minutes.

163
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,320
I'll take you

164
00:11:44,759 --> 00:11:45,559
Understand.

165
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:55,279
come

166
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,039
Let's start.

167
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,000
From here to there,

168
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:00,080
Do a good job

169
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,000
From that side,

170
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,440
The result of the measurement just now.

171
00:12:23,039 --> 00:12:24,600
The length of the room is 4.3m.

172
00:12:24,799 --> 00:12:26,039
The width is 3.4m meters.

173
00:12:28,279 --> 00:12:30,000
Did you hide a print shop at home?

174
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,440
Another decoration team?

175
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,799
How can any device come out?

176
00:12:34,559 --> 00:12:35,440
The area of the second bedroom

177
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,039
It's 14.62 square meters.

178
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:39,240
It's 15% of the house.

179
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:40,960
My master bedroom is 30%.

180
00:12:42,519 --> 00:12:44,200
You're right.

181
00:12:44,759 --> 00:12:46,000
The rent ratio

182
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:48,000
Shouldn't we be one-to-two?

183
00:12:48,919 --> 00:12:49,440
good

184
00:12:49,919 --> 00:12:51,799
The bedroom is a private space.

185
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,519
But the whole No.32

186
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:55,440
You will use the living room.

187
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:55,960
Restaurant

188
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:56,639
kitchen

189
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,120
And the TV sofa in the whole house.

190
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,039
And the coffee cup you just used.

191
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,120
All the furniture

192
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,080
These furniture

193
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,919
When I rented a house,

194
00:13:04,919 --> 00:13:06,039
Prepared in advance.

195
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,519
You can use them directly now.

196
00:13:07,879 --> 00:13:09,480
Is there a corresponding fee?

197
00:13:10,879 --> 00:13:12,879
The user fee is too expensive.

198
00:13:13,399 --> 00:13:13,799
I

199
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:15,320
I'm fine.

200
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:16,000
Alright.

201
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:17,720
You don't need a bathroom, right?

202
00:13:18,039 --> 00:13:19,240
Then I can lock it.

203
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:22,519
a row

204
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,000
you got me!

205
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:25,320
Go on.

206
00:13:25,879 --> 00:13:27,440
You're an illustrator.

207
00:13:27,759 --> 00:13:28,639
Your working hours

208
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:30,320
I spend most of my time at home.

209
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,519
Besides weekends,

210
00:13:31,879 --> 00:13:32,519
At home every day,

211
00:13:32,519 --> 00:13:33,840
Just a few hours.

212
00:13:34,679 --> 00:13:35,960
So on the whole,

213
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:38,360
Most of the time,

214
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:39,200
It will be you.

215
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:40,720
We'll share the water and electricity charges.

216
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,519
But after the calculation,

217
00:13:42,519 --> 00:13:44,200
My loss is at least half.

218
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:45,399
But I'm reading that

219
00:13:45,399 --> 00:13:46,600
Because of my old schoolmate,

220
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,120
I'm willing to rent it at a 50 / 50 rate.

221
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,559
This is the bottom line.

222
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:53,000
You have one minute to think about it.

223
00:13:53,039 --> 00:13:53,799
Will you sign it or not?

224
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:57,600
I won't sign it.

225
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:59,120
Sleep on the street.

226
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,159
Eat whatever you want in the fridge.

227
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,879
No extra charges for utilities.

228
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,320
But the rent is only half.

229
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:07,200
The bottom line.

230
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,080
Happy sharing.

231
00:14:18,519 --> 00:14:19,120
In the contract,

232
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:21,080
My phone number and company address are on it.

233
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:24,200
You'll be at the office at 6: 00 tonight.

234
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,080
Don't be late.

235
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:29,000
Don't touch it when you're not working.

236
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:30,320
I won't answer if you call me.

237
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,240
know

238
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,799
There will be a welcome tonight, right?

239
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:39,600
Buy a mattress.

240
00:14:40,039 --> 00:14:40,720
Don't be late.

241
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:50,320
In order to see the Ferris wheel,

242
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:54,200
I have to face the schedule every day.

243
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,759
Little turtle.

244
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:33,000
Hello

245
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:34,360
My name is Chen An An.

246
00:15:34,919 --> 00:15:35,639
What about you?

247
00:15:37,799 --> 00:15:39,039
Don't run.

248
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,399
Recipe of the week

249
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:53,360
terrible

250
00:15:53,879 --> 00:15:55,720
He didn't even let the turtle go.

251
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,000
Miss Hua,

252
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:26,480
You're up early, Hua Xiao Guo.

253
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:27,879
You didn't call me on purpose.

254
00:16:27,879 --> 00:16:28,720
And made me late.

255
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,360
I called you just now.

256
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:31,720
It's not my business to go to school.

257
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:33,480
I've never seen a mother like you.

258
00:16:33,879 --> 00:16:34,600
That's enough.

259
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:35,720
Hurry up. Breakfast is in the box.

260
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:36,559
It's too late to leave.

261
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:37,600
Hurry up.

262
00:16:38,519 --> 00:16:39,039
Xiao Guo.

263
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:40,759
Xiao Guo.

264
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:44,960
The world is so beautiful.

265
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:47,000
Why are you so grumpy?

266
00:16:49,039 --> 00:16:50,600
Young people nowadays

267
00:16:53,559 --> 00:16:54,840
Why are you here again?

268
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:56,200
Miss Hua,

269
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:58,279
I'm not leaving.

270
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:03,919
This project is indeed difficult.

271
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,640
For three months,

272
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:07,680
Boss

273
00:17:07,799 --> 00:17:08,839
Such a big project.

274
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,839
Isn't the time too short?

275
00:17:11,519 --> 00:17:12,599
That's right, boss.

276
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,319
Why don't you think about it?

277
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:15,440
Everyone,

278
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:17,119
I've been working hard

279
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:19,720
The longest I can get.

280
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,480
It can't take the pressure

281
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:23,319
To our technical department.

282
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,480
For three months,

283
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:29,599
enough

284
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:33,440
actually

285
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:35,400
The underlying logic and the basic technical architecture

286
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:36,519
I've finished everything.

287
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,599
We'll distribute it to you.

288
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:40,079
He's a colleague of our engineering department.

289
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:42,279
The schedule for advancing the work.

290
00:17:46,519 --> 00:17:47,400
Seriously, boss?

291
00:17:47,559 --> 00:17:48,559
So accurate.

292
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,359
Everyone's daily work

293
00:17:52,359 --> 00:17:53,079
And workload.

294
00:17:53,279 --> 00:17:54,559
I've made a detailed arrangement.

295
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:57,000
As long as we follow the schedule strictly,

296
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:58,440
Work hard.

297
00:17:58,839 --> 00:17:59,799
Three months.

298
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:00,559
That's enough.

299
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:03,640
what

300
00:18:04,279 --> 00:18:05,880
So you are classmates.

301
00:18:08,119 --> 00:18:09,599
I told you.

302
00:18:10,039 --> 00:18:11,640
Otherwise, the change of Lin Yu

303
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:14,359
Right?

304
00:18:15,079 --> 00:18:17,279
How could Lin Yu be easily convinced?

305
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:19,200
To share with someone else?

306
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:22,920
It's not easy for me.

307
00:18:23,599 --> 00:18:24,240
Miss Hua,

308
00:18:24,359 --> 00:18:25,480
Under the sky,

309
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:26,839
Is there such an overbearing clause?

310
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:29,200
I just rent a second bedroom.

311
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:31,319
He wants half of my rent.

312
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:32,839
It's like

313
00:18:33,119 --> 00:18:33,880
It's like

314
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:36,000
We bought a bun together.

315
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:37,799
We agreed to share it with each other.

316
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:39,200
But he ate stuffed buns.

317
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,480
I'll eat the bun.

318
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:48,240
Easy, easy.

319
00:18:49,119 --> 00:18:51,000
Why are you eating like a flower?

320
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:52,720
Drink some soy milk.

321
00:18:52,759 --> 00:18:53,720
Don't choke.

322
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:55,839
Slow down.

323
00:19:00,079 --> 00:19:01,680
To be honest with you,

324
00:19:02,839 --> 00:19:04,000
Lin Yu's personality

325
00:19:04,599 --> 00:19:06,519
I didn't calculate the decoration fee with you.

326
00:19:06,519 --> 00:19:08,079
Every expenditure

327
00:19:08,519 --> 00:19:10,519
He has been very kind to you.

328
00:19:10,519 --> 00:19:11,359
Renovation

329
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:12,680
That's right.

330
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:14,200
It turns out that my house

331
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15,440
It's a rough house.

332
00:19:16,039 --> 00:19:17,319
I planned to.

333
00:19:17,319 --> 00:19:18,680
Simply decorate it.

334
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:19,759
And rent it out.

335
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:21,240
But Lin Yu

336
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:22,400
He insisted that

337
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:24,279
We need cement blank.

338
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,359
And signed a five-year contract with me.

339
00:19:26,839 --> 00:19:28,200
A five-year contract.

340
00:19:31,279 --> 00:19:31,960
Right.

341
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:36,039
Yes?

342
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,640
You don't find it strange at all.

343
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,480
What's so strange?

344
00:19:43,119 --> 00:19:44,200
His schedule

345
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:45,799
Even after death,

346
00:19:45,799 --> 00:19:47,440
Are arranged clearly.

347
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:50,400
He didn't sign the contract directly to the end of the world.

348
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,039
I find it strange.

349
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:53,640
That's true.

350
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:57,079
Time flies so fast.

351
00:19:57,519 --> 00:19:59,240
The contract is due.

352
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:02,039
There's only half a year left.

353
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:04,759
Don't say that.

354
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,039
Back then,

355
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:07,759
In the decoration of this house,

356
00:20:07,839 --> 00:20:08,599
Lin Yu,

357
00:20:08,599 --> 00:20:10,720
Really took a lot of effort.

358
00:20:11,559 --> 00:20:12,200
Sometimes,

359
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,039
I'm really curious.

360
00:20:13,079 --> 00:20:14,839
I want to catch him and talk to him.

361
00:20:16,039 --> 00:20:17,839
But when I saw his face,

362
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:20,039
I'm not interested.

363
00:20:20,079 --> 00:20:21,079
I'm not interested.

364
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,000
I'm telling you,

365
00:20:22,079 --> 00:20:23,640
Fortunately, you didn't ask him.

366
00:20:23,759 --> 00:20:24,960
As soon as your problem comes out,

367
00:20:25,319 --> 00:20:28,079
He should have half a book of questions to refute you.

368
00:20:29,599 --> 00:20:30,559
You know him well.

369
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:31,559
You know him well.

370
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,000
I

371
00:20:33,519 --> 00:20:34,720
We are at the same table.

372
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:36,519
on

373
00:20:36,759 --> 00:20:37,839
It's a chance meeting.

374
00:20:38,319 --> 00:20:39,720
But money is just a life.

375
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,920
So you two are at the same table.

376
00:20:46,519 --> 00:20:49,279
This deskmate is the deepest classmate.

377
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,799
From the same table,

378
00:20:55,359 --> 00:20:57,039
To live together.

379
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:01,839
Don't say that.

380
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,279
Your fate

381
00:21:03,319 --> 00:21:04,799
Is so deep.

382
00:21:05,599 --> 00:21:06,440
Miss Hua,

383
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:08,640
We are sharing a house.

384
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:09,799
Not cohabitation.

385
00:21:10,319 --> 00:21:10,799
That's right.

386
00:21:10,839 --> 00:21:11,640
Living together.

387
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:12,519
Living together.

388
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:14,599
No, no.

389
00:21:14,759 --> 00:21:15,759
It's a shared house.

390
00:21:15,759 --> 00:21:16,599
co-renting

391
00:21:19,519 --> 00:21:20,680
Watch the steps.

392
00:21:20,759 --> 00:21:21,400
Slow down.

393
00:21:21,839 --> 00:21:23,079
I'm not talking about you.

394
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,960
Since you are so unwilling to spend money,

395
00:21:25,279 --> 00:21:26,000
What are you doing?

396
00:21:26,079 --> 00:21:28,480
Instead of buying a mattress with the biggest discount,

397
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,039
Wait a second.

398
00:21:31,079 --> 00:21:31,640
Put it down.

399
00:21:32,319 --> 00:21:32,880
Put it down.

400
00:21:33,519 --> 00:21:34,000
I'm exhausted.

401
00:21:34,039 --> 00:21:35,519
He's not responsible for delivery.

402
00:21:36,359 --> 00:21:37,759
The cost and time of transportation

403
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:40,400
The discount is fully offset.

404
00:21:43,359 --> 00:21:44,279
I think

405
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:45,880
If you go to the market,

406
00:21:46,359 --> 00:21:48,119
You can definitely defeat those

407
00:21:48,319 --> 00:21:49,880
Battle-hardened old aunts.

408
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:58,359
It's so comfortable.

409
00:22:14,759 --> 00:22:15,759
Chen An'an.

410
00:22:19,279 --> 00:22:20,039
what are you doing?

411
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:21,400
Get up.

412
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:23,640
Why?

413
00:22:24,519 --> 00:22:25,240
Get up.

414
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:26,319
Look at your dirty clothes.

415
00:22:26,319 --> 00:22:28,279
The dust stuck to the new mattress.

416
00:22:28,359 --> 00:22:28,839
get up

417
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:32,599
I won't.

418
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,079
I'm exhausted.

419
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:36,839
Besides,

420
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:39,279
I have the right to use this mattress.

421
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:42,920
yes

422
00:22:43,559 --> 00:22:44,880
But the ownership is mine.

423
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,079
Including this bed.

424
00:22:46,079 --> 00:22:48,200
I own the new mattress now.

425
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,039
And I can replace it with a mat right now.

426
00:22:50,079 --> 00:22:50,640
Get up.

427
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:54,799
Take off your dirty clothes.

428
00:22:56,359 --> 00:22:57,119
take off

429
00:22:58,799 --> 00:22:59,680
Schedule

430
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:00,279
how

431
00:23:00,279 --> 00:23:01,319
You wait.

432
00:23:02,759 --> 00:23:03,400
to remove

433
00:23:07,759 --> 00:23:09,240
I told you to wait and see.

434
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:12,319
That's right.

435
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:15,960
Take it off.

436
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,039
还脱衣服

437
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:43,519
This is your dinner.

438
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:48,000
These are low-calorie and high-fiber combinations.

439
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:57,640
It seems that

440
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:59,599
There's nothing else to eat.

441
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:06,839
It's not you.

442
00:24:07,359 --> 00:24:08,759
Can you swallow it?

443
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:11,559
I think it's healthy.

444
00:24:11,559 --> 00:24:12,359
That's great.

445
00:24:23,119 --> 00:24:24,319
You've been back for so long.

446
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:25,599
Do you have any plan?

447
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:27,960
plan

448
00:24:28,759 --> 00:24:29,960
No plan?

449
00:24:30,839 --> 00:24:32,880
To see if there are any illustrators.

450
00:24:48,519 --> 00:24:49,200
Take

451
00:24:57,319 --> 00:24:59,079
You care about me so much all of a sudden.

452
00:24:59,519 --> 00:25:01,440
Do you have any intention?

453
00:25:02,039 --> 00:25:02,960
You have an intention.

454
00:25:03,519 --> 00:25:05,440
You haven't paid the rent this month.

455
00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:14,279
I know.

456
00:25:14,279 --> 00:25:16,319
Where can he introduce me to?

457
00:25:22,759 --> 00:25:24,640
No, I'm a freelancer.

458
00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:26,599
Why am I here?

459
00:25:37,759 --> 00:25:38,559
let it be

460
00:25:39,079 --> 00:25:40,480
You're here.

461
00:25:40,839 --> 00:25:42,480
Let's go in and try our luck.

462
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:48,440
resume

463
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:51,119
Sorry.

464
00:25:51,319 --> 00:25:51,960
No,

465
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,799
It looks irregular.

466
00:25:53,799 --> 00:25:54,960
You're not looking for a job.

467
00:25:55,519 --> 00:25:56,039
Fill it in.

468
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:05,960
Take one.

469
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:08,759
Please take one.

470
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:10,319
Hello, this is our

471
00:26:10,319 --> 00:26:11,839
The stone of Shan Hai.

472
00:26:11,839 --> 00:26:13,440
It can bring good luck to people.

473
00:26:14,359 --> 00:26:15,720
Buy one.

474
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:17,400
Buy one.

475
00:26:18,519 --> 00:26:19,240
Take one.

476
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:21,039
It can really bring you good luck.

477
00:26:21,759 --> 00:26:22,599
Take one.

478
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:24,000
It's cheap.

479
00:26:25,599 --> 00:26:26,720
Your interview

480
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,000
Will be very smooth.

481
00:26:28,319 --> 00:26:28,960
Take one.

482
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:29,880
Have one.

483
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:31,359
It really...

484
00:26:31,359 --> 00:26:32,319
Believe me.

485
00:26:33,559 --> 00:26:34,559
Go, go. Leave now.

486
00:26:36,359 --> 00:26:36,880
hello

487
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:38,440
This is the stone that Shan Hai remembers.

488
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:40,000
It can bring good luck to people.

489
00:26:40,319 --> 00:26:41,079
A broken stone.

490
00:26:41,119 --> 00:26:41,880
To help them luck.

491
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,200
What are we doing here?

492
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:44,559
Look at your unlucky appearance.

493
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:46,720
Can you turn your luck first?

494
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,400
Foreign universities

495
00:26:57,599 --> 00:26:58,319
A sea turtle.

496
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:00,039
What turtle?

497
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:01,319
Back from abroad.

498
00:27:01,519 --> 00:27:02,519
It's called the sea.

499
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:03,480
I'm telling you,

500
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:05,559
Overseas returnees are not very popular now.

501
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:07,400
Many of them have become sea maids.

502
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:09,920
What kelp?

503
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,480
Back from abroad.

504
00:27:11,519 --> 00:27:12,559
And then get a job.

505
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:13,640
It's called sea waiting.

506
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:15,799
Many people

507
00:27:16,119 --> 00:27:17,720
Looking at all the new and different

508
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:18,799
Actually, I don't know anything.

509
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,599
Professional freelance illustrator

510
00:27:22,599 --> 00:27:24,960
Why is your resume empty?

511
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:26,119
Where did you work?

512
00:27:27,559 --> 00:27:28,839
I'm a freelancer.

513
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:29,880
I know.

514
00:27:30,119 --> 00:27:30,839
I'm asking you.

515
00:27:31,079 --> 00:27:33,000
Did you work abroad?

516
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:35,680
yes

517
00:27:36,119 --> 00:27:37,200
Office unit.

518
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:38,720
Government-affiliated institutions

519
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:39,960
Or a state-owned enterprise?

520
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:42,519
It's a private company.

521
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:43,799
Liberal professions

522
00:27:43,799 --> 00:27:44,839
Without a unit,

523
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,119
Individual household.

524
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:48,519
That doesn't count.

525
00:27:49,319 --> 00:27:51,640
Why don't you write

526
00:27:52,039 --> 00:27:53,319
I can't explain it to you.

527
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,240
Go home and wait for the letter.

528
00:27:56,319 --> 00:27:57,240
Just like you.

529
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:59,000
It's hard to find a job.

530
00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:04,400
I don't care. I'll return it.

531
00:28:05,079 --> 00:28:05,759
Leave now.

532
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:06,880
Leave now.

533
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:11,079
Don't ruin my business.

534
00:28:11,119 --> 00:28:12,240
Your stone won't work.

535
00:28:13,359 --> 00:28:14,240
Come on.

536
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:15,359
Get up. Are you all right?

537
00:28:16,039 --> 00:28:17,119
What are you doing?

538
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:18,559
Who are you?

539
00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:19,119
Mind your own business.

540
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,079
From where?

541
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:21,559
I

542
00:28:21,839 --> 00:28:23,200
Sea urchin.

543
00:28:23,519 --> 00:28:24,400
What do you mean?

544
00:28:25,119 --> 00:28:26,519
Back from abroad.

545
00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:28,000
You're so bold.

546
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:29,200
Apologize to me.

547
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:30,519
What apology?

548
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:31,599
It's nothing serious.

549
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:33,720
Are you the boss?

550
00:28:34,519 --> 00:28:35,559
Apologize to me.

551
00:28:35,759 --> 00:28:37,400
Or I'll call the police.

552
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:39,480
Is the police station run by your family?

553
00:28:39,759 --> 00:28:40,599
Even if the police come,

554
00:28:40,599 --> 00:28:41,440
What can I do?

555
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:43,079
What's wrong?

556
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:44,759
And ask about the case.

557
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:45,759
To make a statement.

558
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:46,960
And mediate the conflict.

559
00:28:47,759 --> 00:28:49,119
We don't have a job.

560
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:51,720
But you have to take a day off.

561
00:28:53,799 --> 00:28:55,079
Working in the office.

562
00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:57,960
The most important thing is the leader's impression of you.

563
00:28:59,119 --> 00:29:01,680
A guy who can get into trouble at any time.

564
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:03,359
What do you think the leader will think of you?

565
00:29:03,839 --> 00:29:04,759
Don't scare me.

566
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:06,559
Our leader is not here today.

567
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:07,960
No, right?

568
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:08,599
a row

569
00:29:09,279 --> 00:29:10,759
We'll stay here today.

570
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:12,920
You won't block the door or make trouble.

571
00:29:13,359 --> 00:29:15,640
But everyone who wants to apply for a job

572
00:29:15,799 --> 00:29:17,720
We will remind him

573
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:20,640
Be careful of your temper.

574
00:29:23,119 --> 00:29:24,440
How long do you think it will take?

575
00:29:24,519 --> 00:29:26,440
To attract the attention of your colleagues.

576
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:27,680
One hour.

577
00:29:28,279 --> 00:29:29,079
Two hours.

578
00:29:30,039 --> 00:29:31,640
Half a day is enough.

579
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:32,359
you

580
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:34,599
Don't bully me.

581
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:35,839
Don't apologize.

582
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:40,000
sorry

583
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:41,680
What are you apologizing for?

584
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:42,119
sorry

585
00:29:42,119 --> 00:29:42,839
You pushed me?

586
00:29:45,759 --> 00:29:46,599
Sorry, both of you.

587
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:47,799
sorry

588
00:29:48,079 --> 00:29:48,759
I was wrong.

589
00:29:52,759 --> 00:29:53,880
Okay, forget it.

590
00:29:55,839 --> 00:29:56,599
a row

591
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:57,799
Today,

592
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:58,799
You're lucky.

593
00:29:59,359 --> 00:30:00,559
But remember,

594
00:30:00,759 --> 00:30:02,079
No matter who you are,

595
00:30:02,519 --> 00:30:03,599
Be nice to me.

596
00:30:04,119 --> 00:30:04,599
yes

597
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:06,000
go in

598
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:14,359
Thank you.

599
00:30:15,319 --> 00:30:15,960
Nothing

600
00:30:17,119 --> 00:30:17,720
Pick it up.

601
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:19,000
Isn't it lucky?

602
00:30:27,319 --> 00:30:27,880
Thank you

603
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:28,359
Let's go.

604
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:44,359
Hello, Mr. Lin.

605
00:30:44,599 --> 00:30:47,000
I'm the matchmaking service of Millennium Home.

606
00:30:47,759 --> 00:30:50,440
According to the list of objects you selected,

607
00:30:50,599 --> 00:30:52,000
According to your request,

608
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,119
Has contacted all the women on the list

609
00:30:54,119 --> 00:30:55,240
And contacted them.

610
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:58,160
When are you going to start?

611
00:31:00,039 --> 00:31:01,480
Let's start tomorrow.

612
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:02,519
OK

613
00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:10,640
Thank you for what you did just now.

614
00:31:11,359 --> 00:31:12,720
Don't thank me.

615
00:31:13,079 --> 00:31:14,680
I didn't stand out for you.

616
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:18,920
I'm holding my anger inside.

617
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:21,200
He ran into my gun.

618
00:31:23,839 --> 00:31:25,240
But I'm not saying that.

619
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:27,319
You were bullied like that.

620
00:31:27,319 --> 00:31:28,680
Why don't you say anything?

621
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:32,000
I

622
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:34,400
I've always been like this.

623
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:35,920
Was rejected.

624
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:37,839
I don't know what to do.

625
00:31:39,759 --> 00:31:41,839
I think your personality

626
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,960
Is not suitable for sales.

627
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:53,519
Someone sold me Shan Hai Ji.

628
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:58,599
What is this for?

629
00:32:00,079 --> 00:32:00,799
He told me

630
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:02,960
This can change your fate.

631
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:06,960
He lied to you.

632
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:07,759
You know,

633
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:11,200
I'm sorry.

634
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:13,640
I'm not talking about you.

635
00:32:15,079 --> 00:32:15,799
it doesn't matter

636
00:32:15,799 --> 00:32:16,960
Actually, I also know

637
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:20,440
We met on the road by chance.

638
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:21,920
And I didn't contact him again.

639
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:24,119
But he's right.

640
00:32:24,599 --> 00:32:26,119
The more people like me

641
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:28,160
The more you should do sales.

642
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:29,480
Exercise your courage.

643
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:33,279
actually

644
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:36,680
When I saw you just now,

645
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:38,400
I'm impressed.

646
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:44,119
That

647
00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:45,640
It's time for dinner.

648
00:32:46,079 --> 00:32:46,640
otherwise

649
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:47,319
together

650
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:50,839
My name is Chen An An.

651
00:32:54,359 --> 00:32:55,720
Hello, my name is Zhu Lin.

652
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:09,720
When you were in school,

653
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,559
Chen An'an is not good at math.

654
00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:13,759
When it comes to math class,

655
00:33:13,759 --> 00:33:15,319
She bowed her head and began to draw.

656
00:33:16,319 --> 00:33:17,480
Do you remember the time

657
00:33:17,759 --> 00:33:20,400
The math teacher asked her to answer the question.

658
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:21,640
She won't.

659
00:33:22,039 --> 00:33:23,599
She gave you a wink.

660
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:25,319
Do you remember that time?

661
00:33:25,599 --> 00:33:27,000
It's a question of filling in the blank.

662
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,240
You have to choose C.

663
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:30,599
There's no tension, right?

664
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:33,720
I just helped her correct it.

665
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:35,799
Bad classroom habits

666
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:40,400
Do you still remember

667
00:33:40,519 --> 00:33:42,079
The only time in high school

668
00:33:42,119 --> 00:33:45,000
How did you drop out of the last ten of your grade?

669
00:33:46,119 --> 00:33:48,640
You two made a bet.

670
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:51,279
The monthly exam. Both of them hand in blank papers together.

671
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:53,119
I thought you two were joking.

672
00:33:53,119 --> 00:33:54,480
I didn't know you two were really together.

673
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:57,960
It's nothing.

674
00:33:58,920 --> 00:33:59,799
We're just

675
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,720
To keep their promises.

676
00:34:02,039 --> 00:34:02,839
You won't get in.

677
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:10,519
An'an.

678
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:13,440
You don't like to eat alone?

679
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:18,280
Since my parents passed away,

680
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:20,280
I'm afraid of eating alone.

681
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:22,840
It's such a happy thing.

682
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,519
But only one person can do it.

683
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:25,920
What a pity.

684
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:29,880
I'm sorry, An An.

685
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:31,639
I don't know.

686
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:33,239
it doesn't matter

687
00:34:33,519 --> 00:34:34,400
How many years has it been?

688
00:34:34,599 --> 00:34:35,480
I forgot.

689
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:38,920
But An An,

690
00:34:40,039 --> 00:34:42,440
You can recover from a blow like that.

691
00:34:42,679 --> 00:34:44,719
You can be as sunny as now.

692
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:46,199
You're really something.

693
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:49,079
Linyu

694
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:50,440
The truth is, in my lifetime,

695
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:51,880
Are growing on you, okay?

696
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:52,599
I can't beat you.

697
00:34:52,599 --> 00:34:53,440
I'll leave it to you.

698
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,280
In my opinion,

699
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:56,679
You two met again.

700
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:58,639
Mars must have hit the Earth again.

701
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:02,880
Scientifically speaking,

702
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:05,880
Mars will never collide with the Earth.

703
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:09,480
Mars and the Earth belong to the same solar system.

704
00:35:10,199 --> 00:35:11,239
And each of them

705
00:35:11,239 --> 00:35:12,559
In the orbit of a planet.

706
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:15,880
And follows the law of universal gravitation.

707
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,320
And the orbits don't intersect.

708
00:35:18,039 --> 00:35:20,119
So in the lifetime of the solar system,

709
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,519
The probability of Mars hitting the Earth

710
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:23,719
About zero.

711
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:25,000
unless

712
00:35:25,639 --> 00:35:26,599
The sun is gone.

713
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:29,519
I'm telling you, Lin Yu,

714
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:31,960
The sun is gone, I don't know.

715
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,440
You should be glad that my friend

716
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:34,920
Is a very educated man.

717
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:36,639
Or you will be destroyed tonight.

718
00:35:38,239 --> 00:35:38,800
Destroy it.

719
00:35:42,239 --> 00:35:42,880
But Zhu Lin

720
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:45,400
Your body

721
00:35:45,719 --> 00:35:47,360
What happened?

722
00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:50,079
I

723
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:52,440
No.

724
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:54,480
I've been like this since I was little.

725
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:57,239
There's no one here.

726
00:35:57,239 --> 00:35:59,039
Is born to be what?

727
00:35:59,559 --> 00:36:00,320
I think

728
00:36:00,639 --> 00:36:02,480
Even if you don't wear that bracelet,

729
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:04,480
You should really try to

730
00:36:04,639 --> 00:36:06,000
Change yourself.

731
00:36:17,559 --> 00:36:18,079
An'an.

732
00:36:19,519 --> 00:36:20,719
Buy a bracelet.

733
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:38,000
It's your turn.

734
00:37:38,119 --> 00:37:38,559
Yes

735
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:40,599
How many people are there?

736
00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:42,079
There are four more.

737
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:50,360
There are four more.

738
00:37:50,719 --> 00:37:51,559
One by one, come on.

739
00:37:51,639 --> 00:37:52,360
Don't worry.

740
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:52,840
OK

741
00:37:54,639 --> 00:37:55,599
Qingbei University

742
00:37:56,199 --> 00:37:57,239
You're from Qingbei?

743
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:58,440
yes

744
00:37:58,760 --> 00:37:59,800
I've been looking for a job for years.

745
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:01,039
The resume is empty.

746
00:38:03,639 --> 00:38:04,599
Freelancing?

747
00:38:05,239 --> 00:38:05,920
No

748
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:08,719
I just don't have a job.

749
00:38:09,639 --> 00:38:10,519
Why?

750
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:14,760
Fill in the form.

751
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:18,519
this

752
00:38:19,679 --> 00:38:20,880
Can you leave it out?

753
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:22,360
Do you think so?

754
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:31,239
Sorry to bother you.

755
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:57,159
foot

756
00:39:26,119 --> 00:39:27,840
What's the time?

757
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:48,159
Eleven, eleven.

758
00:40:13,679 --> 00:40:14,440
Finished

759
00:40:15,519 --> 00:40:16,639
Overslept again.

760
00:40:18,519 --> 00:40:21,039
The schedule has to be nagged again.

761
00:40:38,679 --> 00:40:39,840
Good morning.

762
00:40:43,679 --> 00:40:45,199
I set the alarm clock.

763
00:40:45,519 --> 00:40:47,000
It's the jet lag.

764
00:40:47,039 --> 00:40:48,360
Otherwise, I would definitely get up.

765
00:40:49,239 --> 00:40:50,360
I swear,

766
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:56,719
Based on your daily life recently,

767
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:57,559
And me.

768
00:40:58,119 --> 00:41:00,119
About your past behavior.

769
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:03,199
I signed a lease.

770
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:04,840
This is all

771
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:06,280
The whole of our shared life.

772
00:41:07,679 --> 00:41:08,599
Look carefully.

773
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:09,960
You have half an hour.

774
00:41:10,199 --> 00:41:11,400
You can object to it.

775
00:41:13,239 --> 00:41:14,639
Really?

776
00:41:15,079 --> 00:41:17,119
This again?

777
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:18,800
The first rule.

778
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:20,000
Sleep on time.

779
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:20,880
Get up on time.

780
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:22,920
impossible

781
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:25,599
I'm a freelancer.

782
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:28,159
Do you know what freelancer is?

783
00:41:28,559 --> 00:41:30,760
Is to spend foreign time in China.

784
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:32,519
When you spend time in China in a foreign country,

785
00:41:33,039 --> 00:41:33,920
Article II

786
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:35,960
In the future, you are not allowed to

787
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:37,199
Eat anywhere.

788
00:41:38,239 --> 00:41:39,239
Article III

789
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:42,840
Stop feeding our black hole.

790
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:47,320
It's called a black hole.

791
00:41:50,239 --> 00:41:51,320
Black hole.

792
00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:05,119
But a black hole shouldn't be

793
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:06,719
Is everything okay?

794
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:07,719
Article IV

795
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:08,199
Also

796
00:42:08,199 --> 00:42:09,800
Stop reading.

797
00:42:10,159 --> 00:42:11,960
I won't follow your advice.

798
00:42:12,679 --> 00:42:13,440
why

799
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:15,599
first

800
00:42:16,159 --> 00:42:17,400
We are sharing.

801
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:18,559
It's not imprisonment.

802
00:42:19,519 --> 00:42:20,119
second

803
00:42:20,719 --> 00:42:22,480
I want to rent it. Are you willing to rent?

804
00:42:22,559 --> 00:42:23,840
Put it down in black and white

805
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:26,000
Third

806
00:42:27,039 --> 00:42:28,760
If I don't do it,

807
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:29,880
Will you drive me away?
