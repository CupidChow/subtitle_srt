1
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:47,000
let it be

2
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,879
I promised your mother to stop smoking.

3
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:52,439
occasionally

4
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:55,359
It's good to be so dry.

5
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,159
son

6
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:01,560
I'm sorry.

7
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:08,919
This apology.

8
00:02:10,159 --> 00:02:11,960
It's almost 20 years late.

9
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,400
My mom is the one who should apologize.

10
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:26,960
that person

11
00:02:27,199 --> 00:02:28,520
Is my first love.

12
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:29,960
That year,

13
00:02:31,199 --> 00:02:33,879
I had some problems with your mother's marriage.

14
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,639
At that time,

15
00:02:35,639 --> 00:02:37,520
She appeared in front of me again.

16
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,199
I selfishly thought

17
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:45,560
It's my chance to choose again.

18
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,199
Then you were

19
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:04,439
Why didn't you choose to leave home?

20
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:09,000
I used to think

21
00:03:09,879 --> 00:03:11,199
My own wife.

22
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:12,960
Is a weak person.

23
00:03:14,039 --> 00:03:15,319
But you know what?

24
00:03:15,719 --> 00:03:17,439
When I confessed to her,

25
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,280
She even

26
00:03:19,639 --> 00:03:20,879
But the eyes are red.

27
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:22,919
She said

28
00:03:23,319 --> 00:03:25,520
She knew about this.

29
00:03:27,719 --> 00:03:28,479
But she

30
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:32,520
But chose not to hate anyone.

31
00:03:34,039 --> 00:03:34,879
because

32
00:03:35,159 --> 00:03:37,400
It's hard to forgive someone.

33
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,039
But to hate the one you love,

34
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:43,759
Is not easy.

35
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,400
At that moment,

36
00:03:47,479 --> 00:03:49,080
I really realized

37
00:03:50,759 --> 00:03:51,800
My selfishness

38
00:03:52,919 --> 00:03:55,479
Comes from the impotence of fear.

39
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:00,120
And your mother's kindness

40
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,000
brave

41
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:02,800
as far as I'm concerned

42
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,360
Is extremely important.

43
00:04:04,439 --> 00:04:05,639
Is extremely precious.

44
00:04:14,919 --> 00:04:16,959
Why didn't you tell me this back then?

45
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,000
at that time

46
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:22,319
After all, you're only eight years old.

47
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:23,839
I think

48
00:04:24,319 --> 00:04:25,360
These things

49
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:27,199
You won't understand.

50
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:29,319
Xiaoyu

51
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,480
sorry

52
00:04:32,959 --> 00:04:35,160
Adults always have the guts

53
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:37,199
The superior feeling.

54
00:04:38,839 --> 00:04:39,680
I thought

55
00:04:40,279 --> 00:04:43,079
I won't abandon your promise.

56
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,160
Can be eliminated.

57
00:04:44,279 --> 00:04:45,480
Your fear

58
00:04:45,639 --> 00:04:46,879
But unexpectedly,

59
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,560
You have become so stubborn.

60
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,759
How dare you

61
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,639
Into a schedule.

62
00:04:54,279 --> 00:04:56,800
To fight the fear you had when you were eight years old.

63
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,639
About the marriage plan.

64
00:05:03,959 --> 00:05:05,720
You always thought

65
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,319
I meddled with you.

66
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,399
Actually,

67
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:15,240
Maybe my expression is not right.

68
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:17,079
But you must understand that

69
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,560
Life plan.

70
00:05:20,079 --> 00:05:21,480
Its greatest value

71
00:05:22,519 --> 00:05:23,279
Lies in it.

72
00:05:23,439 --> 00:05:25,199
When you have an accident,

73
00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:27,040
It will tell you

74
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,959
What is the most precious?

75
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:34,959
When I say this,

76
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,519
I hope you can understand

77
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,839
I understand.

78
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,720
Sorry dad

79
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:04,000
wife's younger sister

80
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,759
I can't go anymore.

81
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:06,480
I'm not going.

82
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,800
Why would you

83
00:06:09,079 --> 00:06:10,519
To her parents.

84
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:13,519
Do you think I did this on purpose?

85
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:14,480
And ruin your love.

86
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,560
To ruin your marriage.

87
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,120
Destruction doesn't count.

88
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:20,839
But you're making it hard for me.

89
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,759
An An, I didn't mean to make things difficult for you.

90
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:27,519
But this is really important.

91
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,720
Is important to me.

92
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,399
Is more important to you.

93
00:06:31,639 --> 00:06:33,040
I think Lin Yu's parents

94
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,639
You have the right to know this.

95
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:37,519
After all, no one is an elder.

96
00:06:37,519 --> 00:06:40,040
You don't want your child to have a better future.

97
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:42,240
I know.

98
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,600
In this matter,

99
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,360
You've always been firm.

100
00:06:45,639 --> 00:06:47,600
But I've been holding on to hope.

101
00:06:48,519 --> 00:06:50,399
I hope you can change your mind.

102
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,240
I won't change again.

103
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:56,759
I've thought about this many times.

104
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,360
We don't need to think about it.

105
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:00,920
next week

106
00:07:01,439 --> 00:07:03,160
I will definitely get married.

107
00:07:04,519 --> 00:07:05,639
After you get the certificate,

108
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,279
You can give up completely.

109
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,079
Where have you been?

110
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:30,399
what are you doing?

111
00:07:30,839 --> 00:07:31,800
Why are you so nervous?

112
00:07:33,439 --> 00:07:35,720
Remember to take your phone with you when you go out.

113
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,560
I know.

114
00:07:52,519 --> 00:07:53,199
Yes?

115
00:07:54,199 --> 00:07:55,360
I didn't want to leave without telling you.

116
00:07:59,319 --> 00:08:00,399
Eight years ago,

117
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,800
But he has a criminal record.

118
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:06,519
At that time,

119
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:08,959
I haven't learned how to say goodbye.

120
00:08:11,839 --> 00:08:12,879
Then promise me.

121
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,319
Don't leave without saying goodbye.

122
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,240
What are you doing?

123
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:29,600
Pull the hook.

124
00:08:46,639 --> 00:08:47,399
A farewell

125
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,240
I don't need to learn now.

126
00:10:43,399 --> 00:10:44,039
Yes?

127
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,000
I regret it.

128
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,000
No

129
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,080
Before you enter the building,

130
00:10:50,559 --> 00:10:51,759
I have something to say to you.

131
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,240
Did Auntie call you?

132
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,519
I knew this aunt

133
00:10:59,799 --> 00:11:01,360
Until the last minute,

134
00:11:01,399 --> 00:11:03,240
I won't give up hope.

135
00:11:06,559 --> 00:11:07,320
That's not true.

136
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,720
Auntie didn't ask me not to tell you.

137
00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:12,720
It's up to me.

138
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,720
I didn't tell you until this moment.

139
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:18,039
Are you afraid that I will fight with aunt?

140
00:11:22,279 --> 00:11:22,960
An An.

141
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:27,919
I hope you're in the most indecisive moment.

142
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:30,639
Follow your heart.

143
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:35,440
Aunt asked me a question that day.

144
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:40,279
When I said I would always love you,

145
00:11:40,919 --> 00:11:42,960
Do you have any concrete evidence in mind?

146
00:11:43,639 --> 00:11:45,240
Can give you a sense of security.

147
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,240
At that moment,

148
00:11:48,799 --> 00:11:50,080
I admit I hesitate.

149
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,879
Did An An ask you a question?

150
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,639
Will you always love her?

151
00:11:56,879 --> 00:11:57,440
I asked.

152
00:11:57,879 --> 00:11:59,000
What about your answer?

153
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:00,559
Meeting

154
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:01,960
Linyu

155
00:12:02,679 --> 00:12:05,159
I'll ask you once seriously.

156
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,559
Since you said you would always love An'an,

157
00:12:07,919 --> 00:12:09,519
Is there any guarantee?

158
00:12:09,879 --> 00:12:11,879
Or something.

159
00:12:11,879 --> 00:12:14,200
Can make her feel safe.

160
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,039
Because I can't be sure.

161
00:12:21,039 --> 00:12:22,559
In this chaotic system,

162
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,759
What will happen in the next second?

163
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,559
But I'm sure that

164
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:30,279
Now?

165
00:12:30,759 --> 00:12:32,559
You are here now.

166
00:12:36,759 --> 00:12:37,360
therefore

167
00:12:38,159 --> 00:12:40,000
When aunt asked this,

168
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:41,759
I can feel

169
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,480
Mother's love

170
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:45,759
Sorry, An An.

171
00:12:46,559 --> 00:12:47,799
I have to admit that

172
00:12:48,159 --> 00:12:48,960
At that moment,

173
00:12:49,639 --> 00:12:51,519
Auntie and I are on the same side.

174
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:56,639
I love you

175
00:12:57,279 --> 00:12:58,279
This sentence

176
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:00,559
Doesn't mean that I like your words.

177
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:02,000
Why are you doing this

178
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,480
Just like this.

179
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:05,159
An'an.

180
00:13:08,279 --> 00:13:08,960
An'an.

181
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,000
What's wrong?

182
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:15,960
Nothing.

183
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:19,039
Why are you like this?

184
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,919
Suddenly, you're saying this.

185
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:25,120
What about your marriage plan at 27?

186
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:26,919
Have you given up?

187
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:32,559
I have decided to postpone my life plan.

188
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,200
This decision is my own choice.

189
00:13:36,039 --> 00:13:36,840
It has nothing to do with you.

190
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:47,120
Children

191
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,200
to accept

192
00:13:49,759 --> 00:13:50,480
It's your turn.

193
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:59,559
You haven't eaten yet.

194
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:01,879
It's been a long time.

195
00:14:08,559 --> 00:14:09,960
We are elders.

196
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:11,840
Just for a child.

197
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,039
together

198
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:14,840
Get along well.

199
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,000
To get married.

200
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:18,240
Haven't we agreed on this wish?

201
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:19,639
That's right.

202
00:14:19,799 --> 00:14:21,799
I can't control so many elders.

203
00:14:21,919 --> 00:14:23,440
Let them know.

204
00:14:23,879 --> 00:14:24,440
Yes

205
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,240
dad and mom

206
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:29,879
You're back.

207
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:30,840
What about

208
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:33,840
PASSPORT

209
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:37,279
What's going on?

210
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,200
Why did you go abroad?

211
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:45,879
PASSPORT

212
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:47,480
What about

213
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,519
You guessed the beginning, but you didn't know the end.

214
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:04,919
Don't look like this.

215
00:15:05,559 --> 00:15:08,559
When I become a great illustrator,

216
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:10,000
It's hard to get together.

217
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:11,600
Come on. Get up.

218
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:15,360
a row

219
00:15:16,519 --> 00:15:17,000
come

220
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:17,799
Alright.

221
00:15:17,799 --> 00:15:18,480
Drink more.

222
00:15:18,519 --> 00:15:18,919
good

223
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:36,799
dad and mom

224
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:38,960
Didn't we agree not to give it away?

225
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:39,759
Why are you here?

226
00:19:40,359 --> 00:19:41,839
Let's send them here.

227
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,200
I won't go any further.

228
00:19:43,279 --> 00:19:44,000
That's right.

229
00:19:44,279 --> 00:19:46,480
An An is also our half-daughter.

230
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,279
How can a daughter travel?

231
00:19:48,599 --> 00:19:50,079
Why your parents didn't come to give it to you.

232
00:19:56,559 --> 00:19:57,319
aunt

233
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,160
aunt

234
00:20:03,599 --> 00:20:04,799
Take care of yourself.

235
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:13,039
uncle

236
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:14,759
To save a fishing rod for me.

237
00:20:15,119 --> 00:20:15,519
good

238
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:21,720
Xiao Guo.

239
00:20:21,799 --> 00:20:22,920
I know.

240
00:20:23,799 --> 00:20:25,039
Take care of your family.

241
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:26,119
Look at the good guys.

242
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:31,960
wimpy kid

243
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:40,640
Schedule

244
00:20:42,039 --> 00:20:42,559
Come on

245
00:20:58,480 --> 00:20:59,039
Come on

246
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:00,759
Let's go.

247
00:21:03,319 --> 00:21:04,000
Let's go.

248
00:21:19,519 --> 00:21:20,480
Give me the bag.

249
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:22,759
good

250
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:25,559
Let me carry it for you.

251
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:28,359
come

252
00:21:39,559 --> 00:21:40,000
Let's go.

253
00:21:43,559 --> 00:21:44,119
Let's go.

254
00:22:30,519 --> 00:22:31,119
An'an.

255
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:31,880
Let's go.

256
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:38,400
Let's go.

257
00:22:58,279 --> 00:22:58,920
Linyu

258
00:23:00,519 --> 00:23:02,079
Whether it's Senior Three,

259
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:03,960
Until now,

260
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:06,599
I don't even know the program and code.

261
00:23:08,359 --> 00:23:09,400
But I know

262
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:12,200
What you are trying to do now,

263
00:23:12,839 --> 00:23:14,359
To help those

264
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:16,519
It's already within reach.

265
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:19,720
So that they don't have to be like us.

266
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:21,599
Go round and round.

267
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:23,759
You always miss it.

268
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:26,759
This is you, Lin Yu.

269
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:28,599
Give the world the greatest tenderness.

270
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:31,799
Linyu

271
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:34,240
I love you

272
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,559
Although my mouth is sweet,

273
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:44,640
But this is the first time

274
00:23:45,839 --> 00:23:47,319
Said the sweetest words.

275
00:23:53,759 --> 00:23:54,880
We should go.

276
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:04,240
Chen An'an.

277
00:24:07,319 --> 00:24:08,400
I love you

278
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:10,880
I will always love you.

279
00:24:47,119 --> 00:24:47,640
Come on

280
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:51,799
Come on

281
00:25:24,839 --> 00:25:25,279
black hole

282
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:27,200
Let's eat.

283
00:26:08,039 --> 00:26:08,519
An'an.

284
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:11,480
I've always carried the wishing card with me.

285
00:26:19,759 --> 00:26:21,839
You will succeed tomorrow.

286
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,240
Thank you very much.

287
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,720
To give us a second chance.

288
00:26:38,119 --> 00:26:40,119
Today we brought some new things

289
00:26:40,319 --> 00:26:41,599
Let me introduce her to you.

290
00:27:05,559 --> 00:27:08,440
This is a story about me.

291
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,799
When I was 18 years old,

292
00:27:13,079 --> 00:27:14,440
I fell in love with a girl.

293
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:29,720
We met through a radio show.

294
00:27:31,599 --> 00:27:32,839
Actually,

295
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:34,680
We don't even know each other.

296
00:27:36,279 --> 00:27:39,400
Should be the most familiar stranger.

297
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
Or the most unfamiliar acquaintance.

298
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:45,240
For this girl,

299
00:27:45,799 --> 00:27:46,839
I don't know much.

300
00:27:47,799 --> 00:27:49,680
But every word she said

301
00:27:50,319 --> 00:27:52,720
Is still engraved in my heart.

302
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:58,240
Due to the limitation of technology at that time,

303
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,240
I tried to contact the radio station.

304
00:28:00,839 --> 00:28:02,359
See if we can find this girl.

305
00:28:03,079 --> 00:28:04,839
But it didn't work out.

306
00:28:07,319 --> 00:28:09,000
Many years later,

307
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:11,720
Whenever I think of the past,

308
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:12,920
This relationship

309
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,839
Still makes me feel sorry.

310
00:28:18,279 --> 00:28:18,880
therefore

311
00:28:19,759 --> 00:28:22,279
That's why I started you on my website.

312
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:28,279
And this project is called

313
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:30,960
Looking for micros.

314
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:40,519
Thank you

315
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:59,480
Farewell to the first draft of Vivian's picture book.

316
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:15,519
A year later,

317
00:29:49,599 --> 00:29:50,160
Boss Huang.

318
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:51,000
Boss Huang.

319
00:29:51,519 --> 00:29:52,359
I'm too busy here.

320
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:53,599
Understand.

321
00:29:54,519 --> 00:29:55,759
Is An An back yet?

322
00:29:56,039 --> 00:29:56,519
An'an.

323
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:57,160
she

324
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:58,400
An An, she hasn't come back yet.

325
00:29:58,759 --> 00:30:00,079
An'an has published

326
00:30:00,079 --> 00:30:00,960
Of the company.

327
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,039
I'll leave it to Old Huang.

328
00:30:03,359 --> 00:30:04,039
Sure.

329
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:05,759
hello

330
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:07,000
We'll leave Boss Huang first.

331
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:07,359
good

332
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:07,960
good

333
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:08,440
Thank you for your hard work.

334
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:09,519
It's a good book. We all like it.

335
00:30:09,519 --> 00:30:09,920
good

336
00:30:10,119 --> 00:30:10,759
See you later.

337
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:11,359
Slow down.

338
00:30:11,559 --> 00:30:12,400
See that?

339
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,160
Boss Huang has become

340
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:15,480
The real Boss Huang.

341
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:16,359
wrong

342
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:19,519
He's a real manager now.

343
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:20,759
There's a pattern.

344
00:30:21,759 --> 00:30:22,599
We are safe.

345
00:30:22,599 --> 00:30:23,720
And became a butterfly.

346
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:24,160
yes

347
00:30:24,599 --> 00:30:25,599
An'an's book

348
00:30:25,599 --> 00:30:26,920
Will be very popular.

349
00:30:27,119 --> 00:30:27,759
of course

350
00:30:29,319 --> 00:30:30,960
When will your website be launched?

351
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,279
Tomorrow at the same time,

352
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:35,720
That's great.

353
00:30:35,839 --> 00:30:36,279
That's right.

354
00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:37,640
Our results

355
00:30:38,039 --> 00:30:39,359
We'll meet tomorrow.

356
00:30:39,839 --> 00:30:40,519
Then,

357
00:30:42,279 --> 00:30:43,119
The other result?

358
00:30:46,079 --> 00:30:47,160
Another achievement.

359
00:30:47,599 --> 00:30:48,759
Can I tell you?

360
00:31:00,839 --> 00:31:02,279
Maybe in this book,

361
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,640
And us.

362
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:04,519
Find it.

363
00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:05,000
to take a look at

364
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:09,119
It's here.

365
00:31:10,519 --> 00:31:11,680
My bun.

366
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:13,960
My buns are on this.

367
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:15,119
This is Lin Yu.

368
00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:16,920
And drew like a gorilla.

369
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,319
Ferris wheel

370
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:58,279
President Zhu.

371
00:31:58,519 --> 00:32:00,000
It will be online for half an hour.

372
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:02,920
More than one million people have registered.

373
00:32:03,359 --> 00:32:04,519
That's great.

374
00:32:06,039 --> 00:32:06,519
Look.

375
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:11,759
Director Lin.

376
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:14,359
Director Lin.

377
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:16,559
Linyu

378
00:32:17,279 --> 00:32:19,039
See if you can find me.

379
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:22,160
Forget it. Let's go on.

380
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:22,759
yes

381
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:18,079
Miss Hua,

382
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:19,319
I'm going there now.

383
00:33:19,319 --> 00:33:20,519
To take the things stored in your place.

384
00:33:21,319 --> 00:33:21,839
good

385
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:26,240
Linyu

386
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:26,920
Forest

387
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:51,880
Chen An'an.

388
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:54,160
Chen An'an.

389
00:35:18,559 --> 00:35:19,119
An'an.

390
00:35:20,559 --> 00:35:22,519
This is the room of No.32 Courtyard.

391
00:35:23,639 --> 00:35:24,360
Marry me.

392
00:35:24,519 --> 00:35:25,199
Okay?

393
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:04,559
This letter

394
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:06,119
And an old friend of ours.

395
00:37:06,519 --> 00:37:07,280
Wei An said that

396
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:08,800
I'm about to take the college entrance examination.

397
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:11,599
She has little expectations for herself.

398
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:15,400
I hope I can go to college.

399
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:17,519
To do a meaningful job.

400
00:37:18,119 --> 00:37:19,679
With my parents all the time.

401
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:22,079
Living in the city of Wangbei,

402
00:37:22,679 --> 00:37:26,199
In this place where you can see the Ferris wheel,

403
00:37:51,199 --> 00:37:51,760
If you keep doing this,

404
00:37:52,719 --> 00:37:54,000
I'm really going to buy a bottle of adhesive.

405
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,280
Stuck you on me.

406
00:37:56,519 --> 00:37:57,920
If you can buy it,

407
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:58,840
I would love to.

408
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:02,480
Children

409
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:04,360
You should lose weight.

410
00:38:04,639 --> 00:38:05,360
No, I don't.

411
00:38:05,719 --> 00:38:07,320
You should exercise more.

412
00:38:08,719 --> 00:38:09,119
good

413
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:10,559
I'll exercise more.

414
00:38:14,239 --> 00:38:14,960
Seriously,

415
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:16,639
The last time you were in Fengxi,

416
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:18,760
What did you give my dad?

417
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:21,719
A lighter?

418
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:23,920
Really?

419
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:25,599
lighter

420
00:38:27,199 --> 00:38:27,840
Take a guess.

421
00:38:30,559 --> 00:38:31,559
Ghost spirit essence

422
00:38:37,599 --> 00:38:38,039
Dear

423
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:40,360
Do you remember that star?

424
00:38:42,719 --> 00:38:45,760
The one you gave me as a birthday present.

425
00:38:48,599 --> 00:38:49,239
You know what?

426
00:38:50,119 --> 00:38:51,719
Such an asteroid.

427
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:54,519
International Astronomical Union

428
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,159
It has permanent naming rights.

429
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:58,360
Is very harsh.

430
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:00,039
first

431
00:39:00,119 --> 00:39:01,920
A yet-to-be named asteroid

432
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:04,239
You need to accurately calculate

433
00:39:04,239 --> 00:39:05,840
Its complex orbit

434
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:08,880
And then predict it accurately.

435
00:39:09,239 --> 00:39:10,360
Three times.

436
00:39:11,639 --> 00:39:13,000
How many times are we going to do that?

437
00:39:14,159 --> 00:39:15,079
Including tonight,

438
00:39:15,639 --> 00:39:16,760
It's the third time.

439
00:39:19,159 --> 00:39:20,760
The precious naming rights

440
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:22,719
I've got it.

441
00:39:26,119 --> 00:39:28,360
Let's see what you want to call it.

442
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:33,000
How about

443
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:34,559
Schedule

444
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:36,280
Schedule

445
00:39:36,639 --> 00:39:38,039
That's right.

446
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:39,559
I don't mind.

447
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:42,079
But if you don't mind,

448
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:44,519
When you look up at the starry sky,

449
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:47,559
You can think of the schedule.

450
00:39:47,719 --> 00:39:48,719
It's called a schedule.

451
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:51,079
Forget it.

452
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:52,360
It's horrible.

453
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:55,320
How about...

454
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:56,880
black hole

455
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:59,159
Black hole?

456
00:40:00,159 --> 00:40:02,760
Let's not talk about the naming rules.

457
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:05,639
The little singular point you raised.

458
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,079
This little turtle

459
00:40:07,639 --> 00:40:08,599
Isn't it jealous?

460
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:11,519
That's true.

461
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:15,400
Internal unity is important.

462
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:18,960
It's up to you.

463
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:21,519
You've already decided what to do.

464
00:40:29,039 --> 00:40:30,159
Aren't you the same?

465
00:40:45,159 --> 00:40:45,840
microampere

466
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:48,039
Hello

467
00:40:56,079 --> 00:40:56,559
That's right.

468
00:40:58,519 --> 00:41:00,119
It's time to say goodbye to Wei'an.

469
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:04,519
Let her return to the stars of the universe.

470
00:41:05,599 --> 00:41:08,000
Let her return to the vast space.

471
00:41:08,159 --> 00:41:09,519
In the infinite time,

472
00:41:10,559 --> 00:41:12,239
In such a space and time,

473
00:41:13,119 --> 00:41:14,039
I can be with Wei'an.

474
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:16,480
Sharing the same asteroid.

475
00:41:19,199 --> 00:41:20,400
To share some time.

476
00:41:22,519 --> 00:41:23,599
It's my pleasure.

477
00:41:31,079 --> 00:41:31,960
It's time

478
00:41:33,039 --> 00:41:34,280
It's time to say goodbye to Wei'an.
