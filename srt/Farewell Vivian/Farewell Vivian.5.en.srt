1
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:35,159
And in my plan today,

2
00:01:35,239 --> 00:01:37,280
I didn't go to the post office.

3
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,319
Lin Linyu.

4
00:01:41,799 --> 00:01:43,239
You have my word.

5
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:44,439
Go home tonight.

6
00:01:44,439 --> 00:01:46,680
I promise to review today's knowledge.

7
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:47,519
Then what?

8
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:49,040
I've prepared for tomorrow.

9
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:50,920
I'm sure it won't affect your progress.

10
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:52,879
And your schedule.

11
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:54,640
Really

12
00:01:55,359 --> 00:01:55,640
good

13
00:01:56,439 --> 00:01:57,640
Thank you, Miss Lin Yu.

14
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,599
Miss Lin Yu, you're so kind.

15
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,040
Thank you.

16
00:02:08,719 --> 00:02:09,319
Wait

17
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,199
Regret it?

18
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,639
The school is 2.3 kilometers away from the post office.

19
00:02:18,199 --> 00:02:20,319
With the length of your legs and the cadence, run over now.

20
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,599
The post office is closed.

21
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:23,520
Take my car.

22
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:25,960
Thanks.

23
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,159
to wait a moment

24
00:02:28,719 --> 00:02:30,719
What's wrong now?

25
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,840
Do you know which car is mine?

26
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:38,759
The one in the shed that looks like Miyoshi.

27
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,039
It would be nice to be a man.

28
00:03:23,639 --> 00:03:24,759
Hold on.

29
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:25,639
to wait a moment

30
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,199
I have another letter.

31
00:03:42,039 --> 00:03:43,120
You're so timely.

32
00:03:43,159 --> 00:03:44,719
One more step later and I'll leave.

33
00:03:45,639 --> 00:03:46,759
Fortunately, I made it.

34
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:47,800
Right?

35
00:03:58,439 --> 00:03:59,000
That's it.

36
00:03:59,159 --> 00:04:00,319
I'll leave it to you.

37
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,439
It's delivered safely.

38
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:02,560
Alright.

39
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:07,919
Let's go.

40
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:08,639
bye-bye

41
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:09,159
bye-bye

42
00:04:28,279 --> 00:04:29,360
You got up so early today.

43
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:30,319
Something's wrong.

44
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:31,959
To find a job today.

45
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:33,319
I've figured it out.

46
00:04:34,839 --> 00:04:36,439
What's so hard to figure out?

47
00:04:37,079 --> 00:04:39,439
I've been supporting myself since I was 18.

48
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:42,199
We must solve the problem of food and clothing first.

49
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,240
Right.

50
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,399
This breakfast service

51
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:05,279
You won't charge extra for the rent?

52
00:05:13,519 --> 00:05:14,519
I know.

53
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:16,920
This is your starting gift.

54
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:18,360
Thanks.

55
00:06:00,279 --> 00:06:02,000
What is this logo?

56
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,040
It's not creative at all.

57
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,439
It's not attractive at all.

58
00:06:07,319 --> 00:06:09,439
How can you be a product manager?

59
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,079
The logo is

60
00:06:11,279 --> 00:06:12,680
The face of the product.

61
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,040
It's like

62
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,079
As a beautiful woman.

63
00:06:17,839 --> 00:06:20,920
To make people look

64
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:22,160
I can't

65
00:06:23,079 --> 00:06:24,040
It's dark in front of me.

66
00:06:24,519 --> 00:06:25,480
Your eyes are shining.

67
00:06:27,279 --> 00:06:28,279
In brevity,

68
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,519
With a hint of temptation.

69
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:34,480
Coordinate the proportion of wild and pure.

70
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,319
It's better to

71
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,480
A little bit.

72
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,000
It's so cute.

73
00:06:42,959 --> 00:06:43,879
That style?

74
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:46,759
Isn't it powerful?

75
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:48,600
yes

76
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:49,879
Yes

77
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:53,720
That's right.

78
00:06:53,959 --> 00:06:55,639
And the color you made.

79
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,240
What are you doing?

80
00:06:58,680 --> 00:06:59,480
No

81
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:00,319
Boss

82
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:02,680
Isn't this your previous request?

83
00:07:03,839 --> 00:07:06,120
Is it that simple black?

84
00:07:06,839 --> 00:07:08,439
Then why do I need the art team?

85
00:07:09,319 --> 00:07:10,199
What I want is

86
00:07:11,959 --> 00:07:13,519
The multicolored black.

87
00:07:20,439 --> 00:07:20,879
Got it.

88
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,120
The multicolored black.

89
00:07:24,519 --> 00:07:25,879
Full of emotional appeal.

90
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,079
You don't need much.

91
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:31,639
Based on the original draft,

92
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Adjust it slightly.

93
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,600
Give it to me as soon as possible.

94
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:38,680
good

95
00:07:47,319 --> 00:07:49,439
There's still no useful one.

96
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,560
Mine too.

97
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:55,480
I have no idea what the press is going to say.

98
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:57,360
What are you drawing?

99
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:00,879
Or

100
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,519
Let's try Brother Tian again.

101
00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:08,360
Are you kidding me?

102
00:08:09,639 --> 00:08:10,560
Underground publishing.

103
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,160
I won't leave again.

104
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:17,560
How much venture capital do we have left?

105
00:08:22,079 --> 00:08:24,759
And paid the debt after getting the money back from Tian.

106
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:33,960
That's it?

107
00:08:34,879 --> 00:08:36,759
Enough for a couple of days, Lesser Snow.

108
00:09:04,519 --> 00:09:05,320
Xiao Yu.

109
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,679
Are you off work?

110
00:09:07,039 --> 00:09:07,960
Just got off work.

111
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,879
How is your blind date going?

112
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:13,200
We haven't found a suitable one yet.

113
00:09:13,559 --> 00:09:14,840
But I will keep looking.

114
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,159
Here's the thing.

115
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:18,399
Your father's Uncle Chen

116
00:09:18,759 --> 00:09:20,200
I don't know if you remember.

117
00:09:20,279 --> 00:09:22,120
We had dinner together that day.

118
00:09:22,279 --> 00:09:24,320
He said there was a girl from Fengxi.

119
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,639
And working in Wangbei.

120
00:09:25,799 --> 00:09:27,000
I've seen the photos.

121
00:09:27,399 --> 00:09:28,279
You look good.

122
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,200
You're at the right age.

123
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,039
I'll give you the phone number

124
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:32,919
Send it to you.

125
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,559
Contact them.

126
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,759
Know each other.

127
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:38,200
No, mom.

128
00:09:38,639 --> 00:09:40,840
I'll handle it myself.

129
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,679
You don't have to worry about it.

130
00:09:43,639 --> 00:09:44,639
Xiao Yu.

131
00:09:44,919 --> 00:09:46,879
I know you're angry.

132
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:49,480
But marriage is not a trifle.

133
00:09:50,039 --> 00:09:51,559
You should be responsible for yourself.

134
00:09:51,759 --> 00:09:53,320
And responsible for each other.

135
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:54,679
mom

136
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,200
I'm serious about doing this.

137
00:09:57,559 --> 00:09:59,440
So I don't want you to interfere.

138
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:00,039
good

139
00:10:00,759 --> 00:10:02,240
I won't force you.

140
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,279
But this girl's

141
00:10:04,279 --> 00:10:05,960
The conditions are very good.

142
00:10:06,679 --> 00:10:08,000
If you want a phone,

143
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,240
I'll send it to you.

144
00:10:09,919 --> 00:10:11,039
Okay, hang up, mom.

145
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,399
A day of hard work.

146
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:36,200
You're satisfied with that can of carbonation.

147
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,720
Some scientists have proposed that

148
00:10:40,159 --> 00:10:41,279
A proper hunger.

149
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:42,960
Helps keep the brain awake.

150
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:45,000
Although it's not necessarily true,

151
00:10:45,559 --> 00:10:47,039
But this is working for me.

152
00:10:48,799 --> 00:10:50,480
If it's not the trouble of writing code,

153
00:10:50,879 --> 00:10:51,840
Maybe I can help you.

154
00:10:54,919 --> 00:10:56,559
Tell me what's wrong with you.

155
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:58,840
What's going on?

156
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:00,480
It's good.

157
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,480
You came out this morning and told me

158
00:11:03,559 --> 00:11:04,720
You're looking for a job.

159
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,320
To get this job?

160
00:11:08,279 --> 00:11:09,559
This is the job.

161
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,679
Look at this.

162
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,639
The iconic little apron.

163
00:11:13,879 --> 00:11:15,559
An outstanding employee.

164
00:11:18,039 --> 00:11:18,799
friend

165
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,679
Your major is painting.

166
00:11:22,039 --> 00:11:23,840
According to the radiation of professional ability,

167
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,320
The job you should look for is a publishing house.

168
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:27,200
magazine

169
00:11:27,559 --> 00:11:28,679
Or even an advertising agency.

170
00:11:28,679 --> 00:11:30,399
This is a place that needs professionals.

171
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:30,960
Okay?

172
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,879
Have you heard the old saying?

173
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:37,559
There is no distinction between high and low professions.

174
00:11:37,799 --> 00:11:40,200
The gold will glow everywhere.

175
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,039
that's right

176
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:44,480
There's nothing wrong with the old saying.

177
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,799
It has nothing to do with you.

178
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,480
Your city illustration.

179
00:11:53,559 --> 00:11:54,440
Are you going to draw or not?

180
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,039
Draw a picture.

181
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,200
It doesn't affect

182
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,799
Here's the thing.

183
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,840
Everything I've lived in this city,

184
00:12:03,159 --> 00:12:04,440
You need money.

185
00:12:04,679 --> 00:12:06,000
But now,

186
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,960
You can't make a living by illustration.

187
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,200
So,

188
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,440
I can only find a job that can make money.

189
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:12,879
It's here.

190
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,919
I can still find inspiration for illustration.

191
00:12:15,399 --> 00:12:16,480
Shooting two birds with one stone

192
00:12:17,759 --> 00:12:20,639
If you are strong enough,

193
00:12:20,879 --> 00:12:23,240
You will stick to your illustration work.

194
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,440
I'm here.

195
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:28,639
Is to save the country, you know?

196
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:30,600
Excuse

197
00:12:31,919 --> 00:12:34,000
If you really want it,

198
00:12:34,159 --> 00:12:35,360
Then pursue it straight.

199
00:12:35,399 --> 00:12:36,200
Not to move or retreat

200
00:12:38,039 --> 00:12:41,000
Your words and actions are highly consistent.

201
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,919
Did you get the result you wanted?

202
00:12:44,759 --> 00:12:45,480
what

203
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,039
A blind date?

204
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:52,159
Your marriage plan at the age of 27

205
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,559
Under your plan to save the country in a straight line,

206
00:12:54,879 --> 00:12:55,639
Have you reached it?

207
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:02,600
Xiang Yuan.

208
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:04,799
I have something to say.

209
00:13:04,799 --> 00:13:05,759
Hurry up.

210
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:06,639
Why?

211
00:13:12,679 --> 00:13:13,559
Something happened to me.

212
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:14,960
you

213
00:13:15,159 --> 00:13:16,039
And caused trouble.

214
00:13:17,559 --> 00:13:18,240
No

215
00:13:19,759 --> 00:13:21,840
Do you remember the two stocks I bought before?

216
00:13:25,039 --> 00:13:26,399
They went up again.

217
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,039
So, you're rich now.

218
00:13:34,799 --> 00:13:35,840
You've changed a lot.

219
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,559
You've changed a lot.

220
00:13:38,559 --> 00:13:39,679
Now that I think about it,

221
00:13:39,679 --> 00:13:41,000
I was panicked.

222
00:13:41,399 --> 00:13:43,720
How could God treat me like this?

223
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:45,360
You keep throwing pies at me.

224
00:13:45,399 --> 00:13:46,240
Why?

225
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:49,960
Always calling me a pervert.

226
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,799
I think you're a pervert in a way.

227
00:13:54,039 --> 00:13:56,080
Lin Yu, you're too young.

228
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:59,159
The money in stocks is just numbers.

229
00:13:59,320 --> 00:13:59,879
It's possible.

230
00:13:59,879 --> 00:14:01,919
There's nothing left overnight.

231
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,600
So now,

232
00:14:04,879 --> 00:14:06,759
I'm going to do something serious.

233
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:12,120
Your company has a new leader.

234
00:14:12,759 --> 00:14:14,120
You're not doing it well.

235
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:15,840
Just come out.

236
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,039
Let's start a business together.

237
00:14:19,799 --> 00:14:20,679
Let me ask you something.

238
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,279
Are you treating me as a friend?

239
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,039
nonsense

240
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:27,799
Don't worry about the risk.

241
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,000
It's on me.

242
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,080
I've earned it.

243
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,039
We're even.

244
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,759
You treat me as a friend.

245
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:36,600
That's why I didn't want to bet your money.

246
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:39,039
In the absence of a clear entrepreneurial project,

247
00:14:39,039 --> 00:14:40,440
Before the liquidation project,

248
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:43,159
You can only die if you start a business rashly.

249
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,039
To be honest,

250
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:46,840
I don't have many friends.

251
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,200
You really understand me.

252
00:14:51,399 --> 00:14:52,960
Do you have any friends besides me?

253
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:58,279
Chen An'an is one of them.

254
00:15:00,799 --> 00:15:01,840
Really?

255
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,159
You two...

256
00:15:05,679 --> 00:15:06,759
It's time for me to go to work.

257
00:15:06,759 --> 00:15:07,240
Let's go.

258
00:15:08,879 --> 00:15:09,799
Where are you going?

259
00:15:09,919 --> 00:15:11,440
You didn't go on a blind date?

260
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:12,639
How are you?

261
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:14,759
My mom forced me to meet

262
00:15:14,919 --> 00:15:16,120
I'll handle it tonight.

263
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,399
She's also from Fengxi.

264
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,480
It's Zhang Rui.

265
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:21,039
ZhangRui

266
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:22,720
Let's go.

267
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,279
ZhangRui

268
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:28,039
ZhangRui

269
00:15:28,159 --> 00:15:29,759
ZhangRui

270
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:33,120
Why does the name sound so familiar?

271
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:57,720
The total is 25 yuan.

272
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:46,720
No need, Uncle Ma.

273
00:16:47,159 --> 00:16:48,200
I'll drink this.

274
00:16:50,799 --> 00:16:51,559
An'an.

275
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,960
You're so fast.

276
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:55,240
And so agile.

277
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:56,559
before

278
00:16:56,919 --> 00:16:57,879
I've done this.

279
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:01,200
When I was in college,

280
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:03,279
Working in a convenience store.

281
00:17:03,679 --> 00:17:04,880
What restaurant?

282
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,160
cruise ship

283
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:07,519
Cafe

284
00:17:07,519 --> 00:17:08,480
For a while.

285
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:10,799
I heard from Miss Hua,

286
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:12,160
You're a painter.

287
00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:13,960
that

288
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,079
artist

289
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:17,759
artist

290
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:19,200
That will be the future.

291
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:21,759
I just want to earn extra money.

292
00:17:22,119 --> 00:17:24,039
How long are you going to stay here?

293
00:17:26,519 --> 00:17:27,960
There's no plan.

294
00:17:30,759 --> 00:17:31,759
Uncle Ma,

295
00:17:32,119 --> 00:17:34,200
You don't think I'm unstable.

296
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:36,240
Prepare to persuade me as a new employee.

297
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,839
With Miss Hua's dignity,

298
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,599
How dare I fire you?

299
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:43,839
Go back to your work.

300
00:17:43,839 --> 00:17:44,519
Alright.

301
00:17:46,839 --> 00:17:49,319
Are you boys looking for a beating?

302
00:17:49,319 --> 00:17:50,240
With you,

303
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,880
It's almost time to call your father.

304
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:09,599
Miss Hua,

305
00:18:10,039 --> 00:18:11,000
Where is Xiao Guo?

306
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,240
Looking for Xiao Guo?

307
00:18:13,519 --> 00:18:14,519
He hasn't come back yet.

308
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:16,359
I don't know where I went after school.

309
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:20,160
Xiao Guo is at school.

310
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,640
How is your relationship with your classmates?

311
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:25,319
How can she be so nice?

312
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:25,880
This is...

313
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:27,720
She fought with a male classmate two days ago.

314
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:30,240
I was called a parent.

315
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:31,359
Correct!

316
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:32,480
It's you.

317
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,200
The day you came to eat,

318
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:37,720
Miss Hua,

319
00:18:38,359 --> 00:18:40,279
I just saw Xiao Guo

320
00:18:40,599 --> 00:18:42,000
She and a few boys

321
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:43,680
Fighting?

322
00:18:47,799 --> 00:18:49,119
Xiao Guo, school is over.

323
00:18:49,799 --> 00:18:50,480
Hurry up.

324
00:18:50,519 --> 00:18:51,480
Wash your hands and eat.

325
00:18:51,799 --> 00:18:52,559
I'm not eating.

326
00:18:52,759 --> 00:18:53,400
I'm not hungry.

327
00:18:55,319 --> 00:18:56,759
What's wrong with the bag?

328
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,160
What's wrong?

329
00:18:58,880 --> 00:18:59,680
The bag belt is broken.

330
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:00,519
Let me sew.

331
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:01,759
No, I can.

332
00:19:19,559 --> 00:19:20,160
microampere

333
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:21,720
You have it now.

334
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:23,400
The life you once wanted?

335
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:21,920
microampere

336
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:23,200
You have it now.

337
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,119
The life you once wanted?

338
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:26,799
Vivian

339
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,920
I think he got the wrong person.

340
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,359
The person I used to be,

341
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:37,480
I didn't expect that

342
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:39,640
Now I have nothing.

343
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:49,720
This is Chen An's real life.

344
00:20:50,759 --> 00:20:53,079
What if it's Wei'an?

345
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:57,039
In her world,

346
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,920
She must be happy.

347
00:21:00,599 --> 00:21:02,200
Maybe the only trouble

348
00:21:02,599 --> 00:21:04,640
Without a boyfriend.

349
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:07,920
Or a little fat.

350
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:17,359
Since it's Wei'an's world,

351
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,799
Then I'll use the microampere method to answer it.

352
00:21:43,359 --> 00:21:45,480
The logo design still hasn't passed.

353
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:51,640
And received a strategic theoretical guidance.

354
00:21:51,759 --> 00:21:53,559
The multicolored black.

355
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,759
And gives the mood.

356
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,599
And powerful.

357
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:00,200
God knows what he wants.

358
00:22:05,559 --> 00:22:06,599
I have a friend.

359
00:22:06,839 --> 00:22:07,920
Maybe I can help you.

360
00:22:08,079 --> 00:22:09,039
Do you want to try?

361
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:13,079
An'an.

362
00:22:13,759 --> 00:22:14,559
Okay, thank you.

363
00:22:16,079 --> 00:22:16,880
I'll take care of it.

364
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:20,480
Xiao Guo.

365
00:22:21,119 --> 00:22:22,720
With a big bottle of soda.

366
00:22:22,759 --> 00:22:23,519
Can you drink it?

367
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:25,319
Please join us.

368
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:27,759
Five yuan.

369
00:22:28,079 --> 00:22:28,920
To lift the bottle cap?

370
00:22:29,359 --> 00:22:30,440
Thank you.

371
00:22:34,319 --> 00:22:34,960
to

372
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:39,200
Why are you acting so weird today?

373
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:43,880
Zhu Lin.

374
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:44,839
I have to go out for a while.

375
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:39,640
You're amazing.

376
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:40,960
I came with a bottle.

377
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:42,440
I scared him away.

378
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:44,599
You're really something.

379
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:11,559
Cheers!

380
00:24:11,599 --> 00:24:12,279
Cheers!

381
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:16,839
Unexpectedly, the schedule

382
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,279
You're really loyal at a critical moment.

383
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,359
And generous.

384
00:24:21,359 --> 00:24:22,759
Buy us a soda.

385
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:25,000
Don't get carried away.

386
00:24:25,079 --> 00:24:26,640
You went to fight alone.

387
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,759
There are so many people on the other side.

388
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:29,960
You didn't call me.

389
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:31,839
Don't you treat me as a friend?

390
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,160
The point is,

391
00:24:36,279 --> 00:24:38,400
It's wrong for children to fight.

392
00:24:38,759 --> 00:24:39,759
Then why are you here?

393
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:42,400
Because I'm an adult.

394
00:24:44,119 --> 00:24:45,640
You're wrong.

395
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:47,319
come

396
00:24:47,599 --> 00:24:49,799
I came of age long ago.

397
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:51,920
The right and wrong of fighting.

398
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:53,880
It's never about whether you're an adult or not.

399
00:24:54,119 --> 00:24:55,880
Violence can't solve the problem.

400
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,759
But when I have to,

401
00:24:57,799 --> 00:24:58,880
Force is fine.

402
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:01,119
Although I wouldn't advise it,

403
00:25:01,559 --> 00:25:02,559
Uncle Lin Yu.

404
00:25:02,599 --> 00:25:03,799
This is the first time

405
00:25:03,799 --> 00:25:05,680
The manliest words I've ever heard.

406
00:25:06,039 --> 00:25:06,519
come

407
00:25:10,279 --> 00:25:12,119
Don't think it's encouraging you to fight.

408
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:13,279
After drinking the soda,

409
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:14,319
Let's get you home.

410
00:25:15,359 --> 00:25:18,119
Miss Hua is the one who is most worried about you.

411
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:39,279
Miss Hua,

412
00:25:39,839 --> 00:25:41,160
My bag is broken.

413
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:42,480
Help me sew it.

414
00:25:45,319 --> 00:25:46,319
You're so naughty.

415
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:47,359
come

416
00:26:00,759 --> 00:26:01,680
You sewed it?

417
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:13,519
You're finally a girl.

418
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:25,240
If you don't take it seriously,

419
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,880
I should have the life I wanted.

420
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:30,480
The current me

421
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
Have a stable job.

422
00:26:33,519 --> 00:26:35,160
Living with my parents.

423
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:38,279
Life is bland and happy.

424
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:41,279
If it's not realized yet,

425
00:26:41,839 --> 00:26:43,559
That might be

426
00:26:43,559 --> 00:26:45,160
I still haven't found the other half.

427
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:48,000
And the weight you can't control.

428
00:26:53,839 --> 00:26:54,480
An'an.

429
00:26:55,359 --> 00:26:57,480
This is our first contract.

430
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:58,960
Sign here.

431
00:26:59,519 --> 00:27:00,799
Is it too cheap?

432
00:27:02,599 --> 00:27:04,359
Where do I finish?

433
00:27:04,599 --> 00:27:05,720
From where I started.

434
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,240
But this is a logo for the website.

435
00:27:10,279 --> 00:27:11,440
Are you good or not?

436
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:15,240
I didn't do it.

437
00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:16,640
I feel guilty.

438
00:27:17,319 --> 00:27:18,599
But we have to try.

439
00:27:19,079 --> 00:27:20,759
Anyway, I have nothing to do now.

440
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:22,880
Also

441
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:25,039
I'll sign it.

442
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:26,440
sign

443
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:31,680
Pretty good

444
00:27:32,039 --> 00:27:33,039
Let's sign the contract.

445
00:27:33,079 --> 00:27:33,519
good

446
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:58,480
Good cooperation.

447
00:27:58,559 --> 00:27:59,279
Good cooperation.

448
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:04,559
ZhuLin

449
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:05,400
You're here.

450
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:06,319
An'an.

451
00:28:07,119 --> 00:28:08,160
Let's go to work.

452
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:10,759
Go to work

453
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:12,880
Don't worry.

454
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:14,160
As long as you are willing to come,

455
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:15,680
Uncle Ma, welcome.

456
00:28:18,039 --> 00:28:20,200
No, I'm afraid that I can't do it well.

457
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:20,920
and

458
00:28:21,079 --> 00:28:21,920
It seems to be different

459
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:23,319
It's not the same.

460
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:25,079
Why is it different?

461
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:26,200
essentially

462
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:26,920
It's all about

463
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:28,160
To the people who need it?

464
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:31,279
No

465
00:28:31,559 --> 00:28:32,319
that

466
00:28:32,519 --> 00:28:33,759
At the convenience store.

467
00:28:33,759 --> 00:28:36,519
Goods are waiting to be selected by others.

468
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:39,000
I don't think I can do anything.

469
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:40,880
You're wrong.

470
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:43,279
In the convenience store.

471
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:44,920
Is the one that needs to be sold.

472
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:46,759
Just imagine.

473
00:28:47,519 --> 00:28:50,200
Working late at night.

474
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:51,160
After work,

475
00:28:52,279 --> 00:28:53,480
I passed by the convenience store.

476
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,160
His tired footsteps

477
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:58,599
To the shelves full of beautiful things.

478
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:01,480
What do you think you should recommend to him?

479
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:03,440
What?

480
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:06,279
Instant noodles, of course.

481
00:29:07,319 --> 00:29:09,759
There's nothing better than a bowl of hot instant noodles.

482
00:29:10,039 --> 00:29:12,079
It can comfort the people who haven't gone home.

483
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:14,160
So,

484
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,480
To discover the needs of others.

485
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:18,519
And satisfy the needs of others.

486
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,200
This is the brightest soul in sales.

487
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:26,440
Don't hesitate.

488
00:29:26,759 --> 00:29:27,480
work

489
00:29:27,559 --> 00:29:28,079
go

490
00:29:51,319 --> 00:29:52,119
Linyu

491
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:53,960
What are you doing?

492
00:29:56,079 --> 00:29:57,720
Why didn't you answer my calls?

493
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:04,759
Let's meet.

494
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:49,279
What about

495
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,640
The deadline is coming.

496
00:30:52,119 --> 00:30:53,400
Have you finished the logo design?

497
00:30:55,319 --> 00:30:56,880
I have no idea.

498
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:01,039
I really don't know what you Internet

499
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:03,359
What are you thinking about?

500
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:05,960
Can I help you?

501
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:10,799
How about you tell me

502
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:13,279
Why did you become a programmer?

503
00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:18,839
I remember someone told me

504
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:21,759
No matter who is opposite,

505
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:23,519
Where

506
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:25,160
What does he look like?

507
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:27,319
What kind of life you lead.

508
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:30,359
In the network of infinite possibilities,

509
00:31:31,039 --> 00:31:33,000
There might be a moment of intersection.

510
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:47,160
Can I help you?

511
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:48,640
what

512
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:51,319
Zhang Rui,

513
00:31:52,359 --> 00:31:54,079
I don't think you can get rid of it.

514
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:55,839
No need.

515
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:57,119
I can handle it myself.

516
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:00,519
Alright

517
00:32:00,839 --> 00:32:01,720
Go for it.

518
00:32:36,039 --> 00:32:37,440
You're finally willing to talk to me.

519
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:42,119
Other places are public spaces.

520
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:44,839
I have no right to interfere with where you go and what you do.

521
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,720
But I'm about to enter the house.

522
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:49,039
If you want to follow me,

523
00:32:49,359 --> 00:32:50,880
I have the obligation and the necessity.

524
00:32:51,079 --> 00:32:53,599
Before we call the police,

525
00:32:53,839 --> 00:32:54,960
Let you know.

526
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:58,319
Linyu

527
00:33:08,119 --> 00:33:08,960
Hello, mom.

528
00:33:09,319 --> 00:33:09,440
Xiao Yu.

529
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:10,279
Xiao Yu.

530
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:12,119
Are you busy

531
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:14,640
You're still in the office.

532
00:33:15,079 --> 00:33:16,720
Just now, Zhang Rui

533
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:18,319
Called me.

534
00:33:18,519 --> 00:33:20,440
About the two of you.

535
00:33:22,079 --> 00:33:22,759
mom

536
00:33:23,119 --> 00:33:24,839
I've made it clear to her.

537
00:33:25,359 --> 00:33:26,400
I know.

538
00:33:26,839 --> 00:33:28,400
You've thought it through.

539
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:29,799
And made it clear.

540
00:33:30,039 --> 00:33:31,160
But Zhang Rui,

541
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:33,039
She can't accept it.

542
00:33:33,759 --> 00:33:34,920
This matter

543
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:37,240
You should handle it well.

544
00:33:37,839 --> 00:33:39,440
Is my dad ashamed of it?

545
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:40,720
No,

546
00:33:41,119 --> 00:33:43,039
It's my own idea.

547
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:46,200
Okay, I know, mom.

548
00:33:46,599 --> 00:33:47,920
I will figure out a way to solve it.

549
00:33:48,519 --> 00:33:49,799
Hang up. Bye.

550
00:34:37,039 --> 00:34:38,000
What are you doing?

551
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:39,880
I

552
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:41,920
Read

553
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:42,719
Observe and emulate

554
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:43,599
Study

555
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:53,440
wrong

556
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:54,920
Something must have happened to you.

557
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:56,280
Tell me.

558
00:34:57,199 --> 00:34:58,519
You scared me to death.

559
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:09,599
That

560
00:35:11,039 --> 00:35:13,800
I'm not good at dealing with people.

561
00:35:15,199 --> 00:35:16,000
Got it.

562
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:16,880
Leave it to me.

563
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:18,840
I didn't say anything.

564
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:19,880
You will understand.

565
00:35:21,079 --> 00:35:22,639
You're right.

566
00:35:23,159 --> 00:35:25,000
The wild bombing of other girls

567
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,280
It can't explain everything.

568
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:29,840
I've told her what I should say.

569
00:35:32,239 --> 00:35:34,920
I'm afraid you didn't give her a form.

570
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:36,599
Do you need it?

571
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:41,880
You can't persuade her like this.

572
00:35:43,159 --> 00:35:46,400
Looks like we need a little help.

573
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,320
What means?

574
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:51,559
Don't bother.

575
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:54,199
Just ask her out tomorrow.

576
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:56,840
I'll take care of the rest.

577
00:35:57,719 --> 00:35:58,519
What about you?

578
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:01,639
I

579
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:06,239
What would you like to drink?

580
00:36:06,239 --> 00:36:07,119
I'll order it for you.

581
00:36:07,199 --> 00:36:08,280
No, thank you.

582
00:36:09,199 --> 00:36:10,719
Is it because of yesterday?

583
00:36:10,719 --> 00:36:12,239
I called your mother.

584
00:36:12,719 --> 00:36:14,239
So you're angry?

585
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:18,119
Actually, our problem can be solved by ourselves.

586
00:36:19,079 --> 00:36:20,400
I apologize to you.

587
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:22,679
You didn't answer the phone or text back.

588
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:25,119
I called aunt when I was anxious.

589
00:36:26,159 --> 00:36:28,800
But the result is good.

590
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:31,000
We sat together again.

591
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,119
Actually, Zhang Rui,

592
00:36:32,119 --> 00:36:33,519
I know what you want to say.

593
00:36:33,679 --> 00:36:35,159
We just need time.

594
00:36:35,159 --> 00:36:36,559
And get to know each other.

595
00:36:36,719 --> 00:36:38,159
Why aren't you here?

596
00:36:38,239 --> 00:36:39,400
I believe

597
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:40,800
We will definitely become

598
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,840
A very suitable life partner.

599
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:45,440
Who is this?

600
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:46,320
An'an.

601
00:36:47,039 --> 00:36:48,119
Long time no see

602
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:50,239
I wish I could never see him again.

603
00:36:51,679 --> 00:36:53,000
This is

604
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:54,239
This is

605
00:36:54,639 --> 00:36:55,400
hello

606
00:36:55,599 --> 00:36:57,159
I'm Lin Yu's fiancee.

607
00:36:58,440 --> 00:36:59,679
fiancée

608
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:02,519
You have changed.

609
00:37:02,519 --> 00:37:04,119
Or did I mishear you?

610
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:05,519
You heard me correctly.

611
00:37:05,639 --> 00:37:06,920
Is his fiancee.

612
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:08,800
Who are you?

613
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:11,679
I'm his ex-girlfriend.

614
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:15,599
Is she your ex-girlfriend?

615
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:18,800
yes

616
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,239
Don't be nervous.

617
00:37:22,239 --> 00:37:23,320
You didn't tell her?

618
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:25,159
Since we are all ex-girlfriends,

619
00:37:25,679 --> 00:37:27,119
That's the past.

620
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:29,199
What about your relationship?

621
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:30,280
I'm not curious.

622
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:31,440
I don't want to know.

623
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:33,280
What happened between us

624
00:37:33,519 --> 00:37:35,119
I hope you won't bother me.

625
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:36,920
I won't bother you.

626
00:37:37,159 --> 00:37:38,039
But,

627
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:40,719
I can't tolerate sand in my eyes.

628
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:42,119
Some words.

629
00:37:42,119 --> 00:37:43,239
I have to tell you.

630
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:48,000
Turn around.

631
00:37:49,239 --> 00:37:49,800
Past times

632
00:37:51,559 --> 00:37:52,320
I'm telling you,

633
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:53,920
Lin Yu is

634
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:55,079
A little idiosyncrasies.

635
00:37:56,199 --> 00:37:56,639
this

636
00:37:58,719 --> 00:38:00,159
That's it?

637
00:38:00,559 --> 00:38:01,679
Think about it.

638
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:03,000
Let's go.

639
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:04,599
to wait a moment

640
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:07,679
Linyu

641
00:38:08,519 --> 00:38:09,960
Go back first.

642
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:11,679
I'll contact you later.

643
00:38:12,199 --> 00:38:13,159
Alright then.

644
00:38:13,199 --> 00:38:14,280
I'm leaving now.

645
00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:23,440
sit

646
00:38:26,719 --> 00:38:28,119
I'm telling you,

647
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:30,280
There's something even better.

648
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:31,079
Look over there.

649
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:37,360
Why are you here?

650
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:40,400
An An asked me to come.

651
00:38:42,599 --> 00:38:43,239
Look.

652
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:46,000
I'm afraid you can't handle it alone.

653
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:48,280
You're thoughtful.

654
00:38:49,519 --> 00:38:50,960
How is it? Is it settled?

655
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:52,800
It must be solved.

656
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:53,920
I don't know about Chen An An.

657
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:55,280
What nonsense did you say to her?

658
00:38:56,679 --> 00:38:57,719
That's good.

659
00:38:57,719 --> 00:38:58,559
Special event.

660
00:38:58,559 --> 00:39:00,679
We have to think of something special.

661
00:39:01,639 --> 00:39:02,559
It's true.

662
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:04,440
Fortunately, you are also worried.

663
00:39:05,039 --> 00:39:06,440
What do you mean I care?

664
00:39:06,519 --> 00:39:08,280
Can you say something nice?

665
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:10,400
This is not related to your life.

666
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:11,760
I have to care about you.

667
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:15,039
You told me the girl's name.

668
00:39:15,039 --> 00:39:16,239
It sounds familiar to me.

669
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:17,960
I'll call my mom.

670
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:20,280
You should thank my mom for this.

671
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,000
The old lady loves gossiping.

672
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:23,800
Otherwise, who knows?

673
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:25,239
Zhang Rui is such a person.

674
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:27,039
That's right.

675
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:28,320
If someone dies,

676
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:29,599
No one can bear it.

677
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:33,079
If you ask me, she's pretty amazing.

678
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:34,719
Are you in a relationship?

679
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:37,360
You can't achieve anything.

680
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:39,559
What's going on?

681
00:39:39,639 --> 00:39:40,440
Who can bear it?

682
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:49,760
Anyway, it's settled.

683
00:39:50,039 --> 00:39:51,320
Should we

684
00:39:52,159 --> 00:39:53,320
Relax.

685
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:58,800
Solve it.

686
00:39:58,800 --> 00:39:59,519
Why are you touching me?

687
00:40:02,039 --> 00:40:03,360
Are you happy?

688
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:07,440
I've said everything I need to say.

689
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:09,480
You want to jump in the fire pit?

690
00:40:09,519 --> 00:40:11,239
It's your own business.

691
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:14,239
happy

692
00:40:31,159 --> 00:40:32,199
I'm exhausted.

693
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:38,000
to wait a moment

694
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
Tell me what happened today.

695
00:40:53,639 --> 00:40:54,559
I remember.

696
00:40:54,559 --> 00:40:56,239
I have to catch the bus.

697
00:40:56,239 --> 00:40:57,480
I'll go back.

698
00:41:01,679 --> 00:41:02,480
By the way, Lin Yu,

699
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:04,159
Otherwise, you'd better

700
00:41:04,159 --> 00:41:05,280
It's better to calm down.

701
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:06,920
Otherwise, the matter will be passed to Fengxi.

702
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:08,119
It's over.

703
00:41:10,599 --> 00:41:11,280
I'll leave now.

704
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:31,719
Aren't you worried at all?

705
00:41:32,239 --> 00:41:33,719
Haven't you thought about it at all?

706
00:41:36,199 --> 00:41:37,039
Have you thought about it?

707
00:41:38,679 --> 00:41:40,440
There are so many midwives in the town.

708
00:41:41,119 --> 00:41:43,679
I don't think it's hard to hear.

709
00:41:47,519 --> 00:41:49,400
So because I'm not in Fengxi,

710
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:50,599
How dare you do that?

711
00:41:50,599 --> 00:41:51,360
Right?
