00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,080
The story, all names, characters, and incidents

2
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:07,360
portrayed in this production are fictitious.

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:08,560
No identification with actual persons (living or deceased),

4
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:10,000
places, buildings, and products is intended or should be inferred.

5
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:15,080
I am living in the vast woods.

6
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:17,880
No matter what worries me,

7
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:21,160
the sound of nature will always soothe my mind.

8
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:26,640
But from now on,

9
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:28,960
things will not be the same.

10
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:34,400
I have a favor to ask.

11
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:46,320
My grandson, Fifa, is coming to help with the work here.

12
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:51,720
I want you to train and look after him while he is here.

13
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:54,120
Can you do that?

14
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:57,000
Oh. I don't think I can take care of anyone.

15
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:58,880
My hands are full. / Hem.

16
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,160
It can't be anyone else but you.

17
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:06,800
You know this place like the back of your hand.

18
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:10,160
You remember all the elephants.

19
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,200
I want my grandson to love this place.

20
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,360
How can I trust him to anyone but you?

21
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:24,200
I want to place him in the care of someone like you

22
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:25,800
who knows this place well.

23
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:35,160
How long will he be staying?

24
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:36,760
Three months. / Three months?

25
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,440
No way.

26
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:39,800
That long?

27
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:43,520
I was going to make it six months.

28
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:46,080
But three should suffice.

29
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:53,200
When I first met you,

30
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:57,840
you requested to stay here for only three months. Remember?

31
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:02,760
Then you never want to leave.

32
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,400
How long...

33
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:27,840
that I have been run away?

34
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:31,400
I left everything behind for be here.

35
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:34,960
I started to lose count.

36
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,400
INTERN

37
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,040
My time here

38
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:46,720
moved faster than I place to came from.

39
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:54,040
I started to forget things on my mind faster.

40
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:07,000
If I keep living like this,

41
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,200
will that be okay?

42
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,240
Mrs. Pat wants to see you at 8 o'clock.

43
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:54,760
I will pick you up.

44
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:59,160
It's only my first day and I'm already being picked on.

45
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:01,920
Damn you, Gex.

46
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:03,960
I can't sleep like this.

47
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,920
Go home if you can't take it.

48
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,320
No one asks you to be here.

49
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,360
Stupid Hem.

50
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:21,400
Kill me already.

51
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:23,040
How can I survive three months?

52
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:28,520
Damn you, Gex!

53
00:04:58,920 --> 00:04:59,760
You're not up yet?

54
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:04,640
Get up!

55
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,160
I didn't sleep a wink.

56
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,600
That damn Gex.

57
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,280
Gex?

58
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,680
That's it! Gex.

59
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,320
Hurry up.

60
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:20,040
It's the first day and you're already late.

61
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,000
Are you sick? Hurry up.

62
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,520
Shit. The water is icy cold.

63
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,880
You can do it, Fifa. Yes, you can.

64
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:59,400
Just take a splash.

65
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,600
Shit! It's freezing!

66
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,640
I'm freezing! I'm freezing!

67
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:08,960
Are you done?

68
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,400
Yes!

69
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,000
Faster! / Don't rush me.

70
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,720
We're late. / I know.

71
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:26,560
Uncle Hem.

72
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,160
What day is it?

73
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:30,960
Saturday.

74
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,720
Wear pink on Saturday and elders will love you. Okay.

75
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,680
Give me a moment, okay?

76
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,560
Wear whatever you want. Just be quick.

77
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:45,080
I must wear pink on Saturday so elders will love me.

78
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,680
Hi Grandma. / Hello, Mrs. Pat.

79
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:02,120
You are already late on your first day at work?

80
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,920
Time is essential.

81
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,640
Everybody here has their own schedule.

82
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,320
When you are late,

83
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:11,880
it will affect everyone.

84
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:13,520
Do you understand me?

85
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,880
Play along, Fifa.

86
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:16,800
I will.

87
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,120
How was your first night?

88
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,040
Huh!

89
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:24,800
He was lost deep in the woods.

90
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:27,360
I stumbled upon him near my office by the river.

91
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
He was lucky that I was there.

92
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:33,080
How did you get there?

93
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:36,760
That is so far from your tree house!

94
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:41,320
You have a lot to learn about this place.

95
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:45,920
What would you do if you ran into wild animals out there?

96
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,240
I'm sorry.

97
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:55,160
Will you really be okay when you go to Japan?

98
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:57,880
Japan? Wow!

99
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,560
Keep it cool, Fifa.

100
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:01,680
Enough of that.

101
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,600
Hem. / Yes?

102
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:07,200
Teach him everything today.

103
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:11,160
Tell him about the place and our system.

104
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,880
All of it. / I will.

105
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,920
Where do you want him to start?

106
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:21,240
Let him help in the kitchen for a couple of weeks.

107
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:24,720
Do kitchen duties, take orders and inventory,

108
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:28,040
go grocery shopping, and deliver lunch to our staff.

109
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:29,320
Yes, ma'am.

110
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,640
Is this really my first job?

111
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:33,560
Here.

112
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,280
Take it.

113
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,600
INTERN

114
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,720
Wear it all the time, dear,

115
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:45,440
so people know that you are an intern.

116
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,840
That way they can call on you.

117
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:51,840
I knew it! This is a penitentiary.

118
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:53,880
I will.

119
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:59,000
Please excuse us, Mrs. Pat.

120
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,080
Bye, Grandma.

121
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,400
Follow me.

122
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,040
Get off.

123
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:40,880
What? / Listen well. This road,

124
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,600
it leads to our command center. / Okay.

125
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:47,880
Our canteen is next to it. That bridge is also next to it.

126
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:50,560
If you get lost, just look for the bridge.

127
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,200
Where are you going?

128
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:55,680
Is that safe? / Don't panic.

129
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:56,960
This is their area.

130
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,840
They're having their meal.

131
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,920
Okay. / But some of them...

132
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:03,920
are separated.

133
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:07,160
That area is for labored elephants.

134
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:09,680
They're sensitive to the surroundings, understand?

135
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:14,040
A loud noise will startle them.

136
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:16,960
Keep this in mind while being here.

137
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:20,640
How are you?

138
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:27,320
This is Fahsai. We rescued her from a show.

139
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,400
She was skin and bones

140
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,000
and aggressive.

141
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:37,920
Now she is eating well and getting bigger.

142
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:43,480
Uncle Hem.

143
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:45,640
Can you take a photo of me?

144
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,360
Please.

145
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,160
Here. / Fine.

146
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,200
Her name is Fahsai, right? / Yeah.

147
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:53,560
Is it good?

148
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:55,520
Huh?

149
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,720
You took it already? / Yep.

150
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,160
Move along.

151
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:11,720
Hey!

152
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:14,720
Uncle Hem! Wait for me!

153
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,080
Uncle Hem!

154
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:18,760
Hey!

155
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:20,840
I'm coming.

156
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,720
You sure love pulling pranks...

157
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,080
Hey! Uncle Hem!

158
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,640
This is our organic farm.

159
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:48,280
We ship our produce provincewide weekly.

160
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:50,440
You have to come here every day.

161
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:51,640
Okay.

162
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:54,120
You said we ship provincewide

163
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,440
so I get to go to town?

164
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,920
Nice. / That's not your job.

165
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:01,120
Well, I can handle multiple tasks.

166
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,200
Don't get cocky.

167
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:04,520
Fine. Are we going that way?

168
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:08,560
He's grumpy as shit.

169
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:12,360
Yai Hotel ordered 100 kilograms of salad greens.

170
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,160
This is Pokpa 02. Order received.

171
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,360
RED OAK LETTUCE

172
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:17,320
Aunty Kaew.

173
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:20,600
Hello there. / Hello.

174
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:22,680
This is Fifa. He is Mrs. Pat's grandson.

175
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,840
He will work here for three months.

176
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,240
Okay. / Please take a good care of him.

177
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:28,920
Of course.

178
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,520
Let's go, shall we? / Okay.

179
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,680
My first day at work...

180
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,240
is already exhausting.

181
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,800
Everything is new to me,

182
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,640
and I'm overwhelmed.

183
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,560
Hold on, Fifa.

184
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,520
That won't do.

185
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,120
I cannot even... / When you wash vegetables,

186
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,760
wash vegetables properly. / you do it gently.

187
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:05,560
Grab the stem. / Okay.

188
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:07,040
Rinse it.

189
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,600
Then arrange it neatly.

190
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,480
Can you handle the rest? / Sure.

191
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,040
Oops.

192
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,640
Sorry, pal.

193
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:23,040
I'm still new.

194
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:26,720
Whoops!

195
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:28,200
Shit.

196
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:40,240
RED OAK LETTUCE

197
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:58,680
Close the door!

198
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,200
What will you do if pests get in?

199
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:04,760
Now!

200
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:11,840
Midlife crisis already?

201
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:13,440
Get back to work.

202
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,200
Hey.

203
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,240
Can't even handle this?

204
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,040
I can.

205
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,080
This is nothing.

206
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:53,520
KRUA CHANG

207
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,480
Padmé!

208
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:57,040
Yes? Uncle Hem!

209
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:07,560
Are you Fifa?

210
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,280
Do you remember me?

211
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:11,560
It's me. Padmé!

212
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:14,680
Who? / We used to run away from geckos together.

213
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:18,440
It's been so long. Look at you now!

214
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:20,560
I love your style, my friend.

215
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:23,880
She could be useful.

216
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:25,360
Right!

217
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:28,120
It's you. Padmé! / Yes!

218
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,440
Right. / You remember me?

219
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:31,280
Of course. / Great!

220
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:32,720
Come.

221
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:35,080
Padmé's mother is our chef.

222
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:37,200
Her name is Pad.

223
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:41,200
Padmé will help preparing food.

224
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:43,320
And Fifa,

225
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,440
he will help you out for a while.

226
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:48,760
You should show him around.

227
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,440
Tell me if you need anything.

228
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:51,920
No problem, Uncle Hem.

229
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:55,840
I will do my best. / Okay.

230
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,080
Let's go.

231
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:03,760
Hem.

232
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,400
Where are you heading? / The command center.

233
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:08,600
Let me tag along. / Sure.

234
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,360
This is the command center.

235
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:13,480
Most of our staff will be here.

236
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:15,560
This is our main office.

237
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:17,680
We hold meetings here twice a week.

238
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:21,680
Our wildlife staff are stationed here.

239
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:23,280
The last place...

240
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,480
Are you listening?

241
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,680
Yes. / The last place,

242
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,560
this is plants nursery.

243
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:34,840
Your job is to deliver lunch to our staff.

244
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:36,320
It's not as easy as it sounds.

245
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:38,800
If you're even one minute late...

246
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,680
It will cause a domino effect.

247
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:44,600
Our schedule is packed.

248
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:46,760
If you're late,

249
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,840
you mess up their schedules.

250
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:51,320
Easy-peasy. / And remember...

251
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:54,120
to deliver all the food by 2 p.m.

252
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,400
By 2 p.m.

253
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:57,360
Okay.

254
00:16:58,680 --> 00:16:59,680
By 2 p.m.

255
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:02,280
Take the map.

256
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,360
A walkie-talkie as well

257
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,200
so you won't get lost again.

258
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:09,880
I'll leave the rest to you, Padmé.

259
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:11,000
Leave it to me.

260
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:13,120
Let's go meet my mom.

261
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:14,720
Okay.

262
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,000
Look at this.

263
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:29,080
Mom! / What are you up to this time?

264
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:30,640
I want you to meet someone.

265
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:33,520
It's Fifa. He is Mrs. Pat's grandson.

266
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,400
My, you sure grew up handsomely.

267
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:38,760
Hello. / Hi.

268
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:42,600
He will help us with delivery.

269
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:46,440
That's great! Let me talk you through our menu.

270
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:48,560
We are cooking Pad Krapao.

271
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,520
More will be coming right up.

272
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:53,400
Can you cook, Fifa?

273
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:54,840
I've never tried it.

274
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:58,000
Bad timing, stomach.

275
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:02,520
Whoa!

276
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:12,560
I'll eat it well.

277
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:13,640
Enjoy it.

278
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:15,280
You must be hungry.

279
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,320
A little.

280
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:23,280
Don't hold back if you like it.

281
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,640
Eat your fill. / I will.

282
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:38,360
It was really delicious! / You want more omelet?

283
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:39,680
I'm full. Thank you.

284
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:43,800
I will be your guide on your first day at work.

285
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:44,800
Great. Thanks.

286
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,920
Are you ready? / I guess.

287
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,080
Okay. Let's go!

288
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:52,040
There are tons of staff here.

289
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:54,800
Each with their own liking.

290
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:58,280
Some are allergic to meat. Some are vegetarians.

291
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:01,960
We label every lunchboxes.

292

Don't deliver the wrong one, okay?

294
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,880
Sure. Can we go now?

295
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:15,160
Some staff will be in different station each day.

296
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:18,000
You have to remember their names.

297
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:19,720
Can you do that?

298
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:21,680
I guess.

299
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:24,680
Is it going to be this hot every day?

300
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:27,080
You'll get used to it.

301
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,720

Correct.

321
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:33,120
Hurry up. The kids will get out!

322
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:34,600
Close the gate.

323
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:42,760
Uncle Sangwan!

324
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:46,360

Feel my god-tier memory.

334

I'll leave them at the usual spot, okay? / Okay.

335
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:07,320
Let's go.

336
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:11,720
Each staff has two lunchboxes.

337
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:14,880
They cleaned it for us. We bring new one for a swap.

338
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,320
This is a good system.

339
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,920
Whose idea is this? / Uncle Hem.

340
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:21,760
He used to do what you are doing now.

341
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:26,040
We used plastic containers but they increased plastic waste.

342
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:28,240
Uncle Hem proposed to Mrs. Pat

343
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:30,360
to use lunchbox instead.

344
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:34,280
It's a one-time investment and it's convenient.

345
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:38,520
Ton calling Padmé. Aunty Pad fell.

346
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:40,200
This is Padmé. I'm heading back.

347
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:41,600
Wait. / I have to go.

348
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:55,880
I can do this. Easy-peasy.

349
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:19,040
I'm getting rusty.

351

Elephant poop challenge?

353
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:21,480
Let's do it!

354
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,240
Shit!

355
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:37,080
INTERN

356
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,080
Goddammit!

357
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:55,640
UNCLE NOI, UNCLE NAI

358
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:58,000
Uncle Nai? Is that you?

359
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:59,360
Here's your lunchbox.

360
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:01,400
Thanks, son. / You're welcome.

POKPA MAP

362
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:16,200
I am lost

363
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:19,120
Anybody can see. This tell-tale heart of mine

364
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:24,160
I am lost

365
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:27,600
I am blushing, my heart does not lie

366
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:34,680
I will go where my heart takes me

367
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:42,680
I love it when the heart roams free

368
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:45,760
02.44 P.M.

369
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:46,760
Shit!

370
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:54,840
Hello.

371
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:57,480
Are you Uncle Noi?

372
00:26:58,040 --> 00:26:59,440
Here's your lunchbox.

373
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:00,800
Enjoy it.

374
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:18,160
Ouch!

375
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:13,080
Uncle Hem!

376
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,320
Damn it!

377
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:31,840
Ouch!

378
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:56,600
Ouch!

379
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:08,600
My shoes are all ruined!

380
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:13,960
My shoes!

381
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:52,680
Hello. Mom? / Fifa!

382
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:54,880
Hello? Can you hear me? / How are you, honey?

383
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:58,000
I... / Fifa! Hang in there!

384
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:01,360
Think of it as your training... / Can you hear me?

385
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:06,280
Grandma told me to deliver food to elephants...

386
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:10,000
I mean, to the staff. / If you fail this time...

387
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:12,120
Mom, I got to go.

388
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,440
I'll call you back. Bye.

389
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:16,840
What are you doing?

390
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:19,200
Get back to work!

391
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:23,080
Don't you want your lunch?

392
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:25,720
I don't.

393
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:33,720
Come on. Take it.

394
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:36,480
I've been through a lot to get here.

395
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:38,600
Look here.

396
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:41,280
That's disgusting.

397
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:43,960
You're late. You're lucky I'm only complaining.

398
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:48,240
That was because I was looking for you.

399
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:52,000
This is only my first day. Doing this well is close to perfection.

400
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:55,040
Your definition of "perfect" is very different to mine.

401
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:58,200
Then tell me.

402
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:00,400
How should I do it?

403
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:02,720
Must I be so...

404
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:04,080
What the hell?

405
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:05,920
This is bullshit!

406
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:07,360
Did it work?

407
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:09,600
That lucky color of yours.

408
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,200
Damn!

409
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:12,120
That hurts.

410
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:16,280
This is Pokpa 20. Calling command center.

411
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:18,880
I need help! Noi is not looking good.

412
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,080
Hey! Wait up!

413
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:32,360
Uncle Noi.

414
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,160
Hey. Uncle Noi.

415
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:38,520
He has a food allergy.

416
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:41,280
Aunty. / Yes?

417
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:42,320
Bring me his medicine.

418
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:44,600
Take a deep breath, Uncle.

419
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:46,440
Keep fanning, Ton.

420
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:48,320
Give me the syringe.

421
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:56,440
The syringe.

422
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:03,280
It hurts a little bit. Ton, keep fanning.

423
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:12,120
Ton.

424
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:14,840
Tell command center to call an ambulance.

425
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:15,880
I'm on it.

426
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:20,680
Shit!

427
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:31,240
You call this perfection?

428
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:33,240
Are you proud of this?

429
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:36,640
Your negligence almost killed a man!

430
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:38,720
You really have no shame.

431
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:40,840
Why are you still here?

432
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:45,360
Get out of here! Tell Mrs. Pat you are leaving.

433
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:49,800
I'm sorry. / Go away!

434
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:54,240
Go cause trouble somewhere else.

435
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:56,000
Get out.

436
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:57,920
You don't belong here.

437
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:02,880
I... / Just go.

438
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:05,880
Go!

439
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:02,840
You are already late on your first day?

440
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:04,160
Can't even handle this?

441
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:07,080
Your definition of "perfect" is very different to mine.

442
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:21,200
Tell Mrs. Pat you are leaving.

443
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:23,800
Go cause trouble somewhere else. Get out!

444
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:25,160
Go!

445
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:06,800
I'm sorry.

446
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:13,680
I'm truly sorry.

447
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:20,360
It's all right.

448
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:41,040
Uncle Hem.

449
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:45,360
I'm really sorry for what happened.

450
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:47,200
I...

451
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:50,160
I didn't mean it to happen.

452
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,600
I know I was wrong.

453
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:56,760
I am to blame.

454
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:05,880
I already know.

455
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:09,080
I don't belong here.

456
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:14,880
But what happened,

457
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:18,600
It was not my intention.

458
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:23,120
I'm sorry.

459
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:29,440
I'm devastated right now.

460
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:35,520
I don't know if you can forgive me. But...

461
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:38,600
Uncle Hem.

462
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:44,720
I promise you.

463
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:49,560
Thing like this...

464
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:52,640
won't happen again.

465
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:13,040
We'll see.

466
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:28,200
This vast woods

467
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:31,000
stretches far beyond the eyes can see...

468
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:36,200
yet I can hear many voices loud and clear.

469
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:43,160
They are slightly different from before.

470
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:48,200
A crying I hear becomes clearer.

471
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:50,440
It makes me realize

472
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:52,760
that this place

473
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:55,120
will never be the same.

474
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:56,880
ONE WEEK LATER

475
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:55,000
He is still helpless.

476
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:14,560
Ouch!

477
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:48,760
