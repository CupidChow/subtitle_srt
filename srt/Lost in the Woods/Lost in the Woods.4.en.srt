The story, all names, characters, and incidents

00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:07,080
portrayed in this production are fictitious.

3
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:08,360
No identification with actual persons (living or deceased),

places, buildings, and products is intended or should be inferred.

5
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:18,600
As we are enjoying our life,

6
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:23,720
things are constantly changing,

7
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:30,440
specifically in a hectic town...

8
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:34,920
where I never wish to go back to.

9
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:37,320
For me,

10
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:39,600
this forest...

11
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,880
is my only safe haven.

12
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:46,800
It can never betray me.

13
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,800
Thank you all for helping.

14
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:48,240
Great job.

15
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:51,920
I want to thank everybody

16
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:55,960
for letting me be a part of this project.

17
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:00,720
Thank you.

18
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,600
Now, let's eat.

19
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:10,520
Let's go.

20
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,440
Thank you...

21
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,080
for always taking care of me

22
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,480
and guiding me.

23
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:21,960
Thank you again.

24
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,760
It is I who must thank you, Fifa,

25
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,960
for helping with the check dam.

26
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,160
You did a great job. / Thank you.

27
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,200
Let's go, hun.

28
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,760
Okay. / Let's eat.

29
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,600
I'll be right there in a jiff. / Okay.

30
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,800
How is Fifa doing?

31
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:06,800
He really gets along well with the villagers.

32
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,520
I heard that he helped built

33
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:09,880
a check dam recently.

34
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:22,120
You said you needed my help, didn't you?

35
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,520
Oh, right. I almost forgot.

36
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,120
Well...

37
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:31,720
I want you...

38
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:34,320
to draw something on a card.

39
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:36,840
Sure.

40
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:39,840
What do you want me to draw?

41
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,800
Right.

42
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,640
What do I want?

43
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,160
It's for Uncle Hem.

44
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,520
Can you draw him with an elephant?

45
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:54,840
Sure.

46
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:02,240
You sure are being serious with this.

47
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,000
I just want to do something for him.

48
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,640
He used to drink booze like water.

49
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:13,160
Not that he has quitted!

50
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:15,240
He is a true alcoholic.

51
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:19,920
He got dumped, you know.

52
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:24,920
Okay.

53
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,080
An elephant it is.

54
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,520
I'll trust you with this then.

55
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,520
Sure.

56
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:40,720
If it's Hem, it must be a lion.

57
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,080
Fierce

58
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:44,560
and fearsome.

59
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,160
Everyone!

60
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:35,840
Are you ready to welcome our singer tonight?

61
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:38,720
Give it up! / We're ready!

62
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:45,680
Please give it up to Hem!

63
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:02,400
There is nothing

64
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:07,600
That can limit us

65
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:13,480
We don't need a reason

66
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:18,160
To be together

67
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,680
We are not different...

68
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:25,160
I didn't know he could sing.

69
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:29,560
We have things in common

70
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,680
Kindred hearts are why we bond...

71
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,320
Here are your drinks.

72
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,960
That is all we need

73
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,640
A highball.

74
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,680
Thank you. / For Fifa.

75
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,640
For Padmé?

76
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:49,880
Here.

77
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:58,440
Your heart and mine

78
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:03,360
Nothing can come between us

79
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,040
Uncle Hem!

80
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:10,720
You're so cool!

81
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:27,280
We have each other

82
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,960
I will never leave your side

83
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:37,400
Your heart and mine

84
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:41,920
Nothing can come between us

85
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:50,920
Bravo!

86
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:54,920
Everybody,

87
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:56,920
you know,

88
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,320
today is a special day.

89
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,880
It's Hem's birthday!

90
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:06,400
Let's make a toast to him.

91
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,280
Cheers!

92
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,960
Cheers! / Cheers!

93
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,400
Hey, take it easy.

94
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:30,160
Fifa...

95
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:34,600
Please give this card to Uncle Hem.

96
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:36,520
Give it to him, will you?

97
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,800
It's your card. You give it to him.

98
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,520
I can't. / Come on.

99
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,440
Hey, Padmé! / Whoa!

100
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,760
She's wasted.

101
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,280
I need home.

102
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:49,560
Be careful.

103
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:53,480
I'll leave her to you.

104
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,160
Will she be okay?

105
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,760
I told you not to drink.

106
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,160
You always end up like this.

107
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:18,760
This?

108
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:19,760
It's not mine.

109
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:21,520
It's from Padmé.

110
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,120
She's wasted there.

111
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:43,760
But this is from me.

112
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,600
Well...

113
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:05,160
Welcome to Pokpa.

114
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:19,960
Thank you.

115
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:14,760
What are you, a ghost?

116
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:40,840
Love it already?

117
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:49,640
I could only say it to you

118
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:51,680
Is it?

119
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:59,160
Love is a meaningful word

120
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:02,560
But it would not impress anyone

121
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:07,480
I could only say it to you

122
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:17,480
"I COULD ONLY SAY IT TO YOU"

123
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:26,640
A loving season was born

124
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,760
I smell something nice miles away.

125
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:09,800
How is it?

126
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:11,320
Patterns all the way.

127
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,680
This is it.

128
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,120
That's a yes. / A yes!

129
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,080
Nice.

130
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:18,520
Hello, Aunty Pad!

131
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:19,960
Hi, Fifa.

132
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:22,600
Well, can we change today's menu?

133
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:24,160
Go on.

134
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:25,520
How about

135
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:27,640
a non-spicy basil chicken

136
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:29,720
with hard-boiled egg?

137
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:30,640
But...

138
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:33,320
Our staff like spicy food.

139
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,720
A little change could be nice, right?

140
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,240
You know, just to spice things up.

141
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:43,360
I also crave that menu.

142
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,000
Okay. Sure.

143
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:57,200
I'll bring eggs then.

144
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:58,480
Okay.

145
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:01,440
Okay.

146
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:17,320
PROD

147
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,120
PROD

148
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:23,880
UNCLE NEUK

149
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:28,520
UNCLE SANGWAN

150
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:30,640
Uncle Sangwan!

151
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,000
Uncle Tong, Uncle Neuk, Uncle Kanchit.

152
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,760
Your lunch is here.

153
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:38,640
UNCLE TONG, UNCLE NEUK, UNCLE KANCHIT

154
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,160
You should share it!

155
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:48,400
Here.

156
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:31,240
Why do you need to plant so many?

157
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,320
This is a nursery.

158
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:36,040
They will be relocated to the forest later

159
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,080
to replace trees in wildfire area.

160
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:43,840
It takes decades for a tree to mature.

161
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,440
But when the forest fire hits,

162
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:49,240
it only takes hours to burn a forest.

163
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,240
Look at that stump.

164
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,400
It was here before I came here.

165
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,560
Whenever I'm feeling down,

166
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:01,840
I'll hang around this place.

167
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:03,960
Here is what is left of it.

168
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,400
Did someone cut it down?

169
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:12,920
There was a storm.

170
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:14,120
It didn't make it.

171
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,000
Hem, wait.

172
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,240
Hold on.

173
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:32,960
You know,

174
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,160
I think

175
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:38,200
that I have improved a lot at work.

176
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:42,200
By that I mean

177
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,400
I ace it.

178
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:47,600
I am always right on time with my delivery.

179
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:49,360
So?

180
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:51,320
So...

181
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:54,080
So...

182
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:56,080
Won't you compliment me a bit?

183
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:02,160
Okay. Well done.

184
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:05,800
Right?

185
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:08,680
Doesn't a person

186
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,920
deserve a reward for a work well done?

187
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,360
Spill it.

188
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:17,240
I want...

189
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:31,920
My head is blank now.

190
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:34,680
I'll tell you later what I want.

191
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:37,200
But I need you to promise

192
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:38,640
to reward me, okay?

193
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:40,880
Just a couple of trouble-free days

194
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:43,840
and you already ask for a reward?

195
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:49,760
Okay, okay. Listen,

196
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:50,920
well...

197
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:55,240
Aren't you hungry? / No.

198
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:56,760
But I'm famished!

199
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,880
Didn't you come here with my lunch?

200
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:22,000
Do you like it?

201
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:26,160
I asked Aunty Pad to make it special today.

202
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:33,160
You have a performance review

203
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:34,520
with Mrs. Pat tomorrow at ten.

204
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:36,600
Right.

205
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,320
That's good then.

206
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:41,120
My scholarship result will also be out tomorrow

207
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:42,520
at six in the morning.

208
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:46,640
I really hope I get it

209
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:49,960
so I can have a talk with Grandma about that.

210
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:56,000
Hem,

211
00:22:56,680 --> 00:23:00,320
can I come here tomorrow to check the result?

212
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:02,840
I tried the whole area

213
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:04,920
but only your place has signal.

214
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:06,400
Please, please?

215
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:08,360
Fine.

216
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:11,400
Thank you.

217
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:17,560
Whoa!

218
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:20,440
What?

219
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:29,200
The signal's gone!

220
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:33,560
I checked and it worked before.

221
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:39,040
Signal won't be stable in the forest.

222
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:42,760
What if there's no signal tomorrow?

223
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:48,520
I really look forward to seeing the result.

224
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:51,480
Ugh! I'm dying to go to Japan.

225
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:55,880
Let's do this.

226
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:58,640
I'll bring you where there is signal.

227
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:00,560
We can

228
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,080
celebrate there as well

229
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:05,800
then we can go see Mrs. Pat.

230
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:08,520
Deal.

231
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:09,840
Thank you.

232
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:13,480
I already washed it.

233
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:30,360
I also got this for you.

234
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:35,360
You're so sweet.

235
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:10,640
Now I know...

236
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:13,960
why you like it here.

237
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:19,480
Looking at the morning sky

238
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:21,800
Could not lift up my spirit

239
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:26,960
Better than looking at your smile

240
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:31,360
The wind passing by

241
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:33,880
Could not make me as ticklish

242
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:38,800
As you being by my side

243
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:44,760
You bring the change of seasons

244
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:50,800
A lonely season is gone

245
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:58,320
A loving season was born

246
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:02,920
With you by my side

247
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:08,280
I start to see the color

248
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:12,120
Of love and passion

249
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:18,280
And I wish it lasts forever

250
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:31,200
A songbird's singing

251
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:33,800
Is far less enticing

252
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:38,960
Than your whispering that you miss me

253
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,320
We're here!

254
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:58,360
You know,

255
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:01,200
I haven't been here since I came to Pokpa.

256
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,480
Really miss this place.

257
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:13,240
Close your eyes.

258
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:14,960
It feels like Pokpa.

259
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:21,320
They're not the same.

260
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,240
They're polar opposite.

261
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:33,840
Hem,

262
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:36,520
I really love this spot.

263
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:43,400
When I look down from here,

264
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:45,200
it really makes me realize

265
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:46,920
that the world is a vast place.

266
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:54,960
Watch me.

267
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:58,040
I'm leaving this place!

268
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:00,240
I'll explore the world!

269
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:17,400
You shouldn't trap yourself in Pokpa

270
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:19,360
just because some girl dumped you.

271
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:21,280
You got me?

272
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:33,480
Are you seeing someone?

273
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:35,840
Does it matter?

274
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:37,600
You act like a guru.

275
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:48,160
I'm not seeing anybody.

276
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:50,360
Then you just talk big.

277
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:34,840
Hi. / Hello there.

278
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:38,520
Got any Wi-Fi?

279
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,520
The password is YaYeeNimman.

280
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:44,440
They posted it right at the elevator.

281
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:46,320
Did they? / Yeah.

282
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:50,440
What did you order?

283
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:52,400
Here's your order.

284
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:55,120
It's not strong.

285
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:58,400
Enjoy your drink. / Thank you.

286
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:02,480
Wow.

287
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,120
What's this?

288
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:10,160
Try it.

289
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:15,040
It's liquor!

290
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:16,760
I'll pass.

291
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:18,920
Why? We are here to celebrate.

292
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:21,880
The result is almost out.

293
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:23,920
I want to be wide-awake.

294
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:26,760
You can have it.

295
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:28,200
Go on.

296
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:34,800
Come on, come on.

297
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:36,480
Take it easy.

298
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:39,000
You can wait for the result here.

299
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:42,080
We can go back to Pokpa tomorrow.

300
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:44,000
I'll stay up until six.

301
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:58,960
How was it?

302
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:07,320
I was so sure about it

303
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:10,360
that I did as best

304
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:12,680
as I could.

305
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:19,280
I did it better than I ever did.

306
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:23,480
But who would know

307
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:26,200
that there are plenty of people who did it better.

308
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:39,280
It's okay.

309
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:42,720
Just let it out.

310
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:49,760
I'm not sad.

311
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:52,600
I just don't understand.

312
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:58,680
Sometimes,

313
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:01,520
you don't need to understand everything.

314
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:04,680
Just leave me alone.

315
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:06,640
Wait.

316
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:25,040
You can go back.

317
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:34,200
You failed this time.

318
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:36,920
But it's not the end.

319
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:54,840
It is.

320
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:58,680
It all ended.

321
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:02,240
I already told you

322
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:04,560
that I want to leave this place.

323
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:14,960
I don't care about that soil, water,

324
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:17,200
trees, or any bullshit knowledge.

325
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:29,080
I'll be here for you.

326
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:49,400
No one is too prepared for every changes...

327
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:56,040
whether it happens in a forest or in a city.

328
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:04,640
The hardest change to face

329
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:07,080
must be

330
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:10,000
a change of heart.

331
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:16,800
Third?

332
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:22,560
Looking at the morning sky

333
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:24,880
Could not lift up my spirit

334
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:30,040
Better than looking at your smile

335
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:34,440
The wind passing by

336
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:36,960
Could not make me as ticklish

337
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:41,880
As you being by my side

338
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:47,840
You bring the change of seasons

339
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:53,880
A lonely season is gone

340
00:41:54,480 --> 00:42:01,480
A loving season was born

341
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:06,000
With you by my side

342
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:11,360
I start to see the color

343
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:15,200
Of love and passion

344
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:21,360
And I wish it lasts forever

345
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:34,280
A songbird's singing

346
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:36,840
Is far less enticing

347
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:42,080
Than your whispering that you miss me

348
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:46,440
Love is a meaningful word

349
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:48,800
But it would not impress anyone

350
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:54,000
I could only say it to you

351
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:59,680
You bring the change of seasons

352
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:05,920
A lonely season is gone

353
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:13,440
A loving season was born

354
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:18,040
With you by my side

355
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:23,400
I start to see the color

356
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:27,320
Of love and passion

357
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:30,720
In every season of love

358
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:35,840
Being together in this great atmosphere

359
00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:42,240
With trees, rivers, and mountains near

360
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:48,440
I am blessed to have found you

361
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:53,400
A plot from the novel "Lost in the woods" by theneoclassic

362
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:57,440
And I wish it lasts forever
