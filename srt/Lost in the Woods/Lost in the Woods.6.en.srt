1
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The story, all names, characters, and incidents

2
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:07,080
portrayed in this production are fictitious.

3
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:08,360
No identification with actual persons (living or deceased),

4
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:09,920
places, buildings, and products is intended or should be inferred.

5
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,360
Wait for me here when you're finished.

6
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:32,880
I'll be back.

7
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,200
Hey! Why didn't you answer my radio?

8
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,280
Mine is dead.

9
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:43,040
I'm coming.

10
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:47,440
Is everything okay? / Yeah.

11
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,200
Let's go.

12
00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:00,400
The ones that fell down... / Yes?

13
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,720
Remember, elephants will only eat what they like.

14
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:29,080
They won't eat the parts that are too young

15
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:30,360
or too hard.

16
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:33,320
So, this area will clean when we clean up

17
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,960
and the elephants have clean food to eat.

18
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,680
Fifa, are you okay?

19
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:58,480
Hem,

20
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:01,800
those poachers should be up ahead.

21
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,520
Let's go.

22
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,320
We're on the right track.

23
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,480
Let's camp here for tonight.

24
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,560
They can't be far.

25
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:35,200
Okay.

26
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:25,600
We got a report there had been poaching

27
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,160
in this area.

28
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:30,080
Okay. Pat, you cover the left.

29
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,600
Asavin, take the middle path. / Okay.

30
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:34,000
The rest take the right path.

31
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:37,200
You lead them, Prod. / Okay.

32
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:07,320
<i>It's been three days. Where is he?</i>

33
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:36,320
Fifa, you carry those leaves.

34
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:37,920
This way please.

35
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,560
Where should I put it? / There.

36
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,040
The elephants will come soon.

37
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:55,440
Maimai, Wanmai! Come eat! / Here they come.

38
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,160
Lunch time!

39
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,080
How is your day?

40
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:09,320
It's okay.

41
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,880
I need to go back as soon as we are done.

42
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,000
Okay. Let's go.

43
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:16,640
Fifa!

44
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,400
Let me drop you off.

45
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:22,640
I'll go with her then. / Okay.

46
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,200
Bye. See you guys later. / Bye.

47
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,080
Thank you. I'll tag along with my friend.

48
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:29,280
I've already prepared them. / Let's go.

49
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,040
Ready? / Yes. Let's go.

50
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:53,400
Let's go.

51
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:27,760
What's this book about?

52
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:29,760
THE MOON IN JAPANESE CULTURE

53
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:31,160
You should read it.

54
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:35,320
Let me focus on this first, okay?

55
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:40,600
Fine.

56
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,160
But... / Padmé!

57
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:50,280
Would you please?

58
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:01,040
"The Moon in Japanese culture"

59
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,480
Prod!

60
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:29,160
Hey, why are you here?

61
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:34,120
I'm hanging out with Fifa and keeping him company.

62
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,320
How is it going?

63
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,160
Fifa...

64
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:10,760
I'm sorry.

65
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:48,640
Let's eat.

66
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:00,960
So good!

67
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,960
Have some. It's good.

68
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:37,240
Won't you eat?

69
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,040
Can't let it go to waste.

70
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,840
Hey, you should eat some.

71
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:53,640
Come on. / Padmé,

72
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:55,720
When you are starving,

73
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:58,480
your brain will trick you to forget your hunger.

74
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:01,600
But when it senses food in your system,

75
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:03,880
your stomach will suddenly release acid.

76
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:06,480
Just when you have your first bite,

77
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:09,200
you'll realize that you are starving.

78
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,120
Totally starving!

79
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:49,520
Padmé...

80
00:19:58,840 --> 00:19:59,960
Such a caring individual.

81
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:14,560
It's stuck.

82
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,840
Have my water. / Won't you help me out?

83
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:19,920
Help yourself. / Fine.

84
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:44,680
I'm so full.

85
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:00,640
The Moon is beautiful, isn't it?

86
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:10,400
What?

87
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:13,800
Why? Is it not?

88
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,200
It is.

89
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:19,280
It's so beautiful.

90
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,040
Then why are you twitching like that?

91
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:31,040
Well...

92
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:35,200
Japanese people have a way of confessing

93
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:37,320
their love by asking people they like

94
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,520
"The Moon is beautiful, isn't it?"

95
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,920
How come the Moon is related to love at all?

96
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:47,160
How should I explain this?

97
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:52,280
In Japanese, the Moon is pronounced "tsuki".

98
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:55,960
It sounds like the word "suki" which means love.

99
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:11,360
But...

100
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:13,240
If that person has no clue

101
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:14,640
they are being confessed to,

102
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:16,320
how would they respond?

103
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:19,720
If they don't know about it,

104
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:24,520
they will still tell you how they truly feel

105
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:26,720
because when you look at the Moon,

106
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:30,800
you will often speak what is in your mind.

107
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:47,840
Well,

108
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:49,960
if their feelings are mutual,

109
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:53,200
how would they respond to that sentence?

110
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:55,840
They...

111
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,080
I will literally translate it, okay?

112
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:01,960
They will respond by saying

113
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:05,360
"The Moon is always beautiful."

114
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:09,160
Which means?

115
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:13,160
I already have feelings for you.

116
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:35,600
I think... the Moon is always beautiful.

117
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:29,360
<i>Calling Pokpa 07. Gather here immediately, over.</i>

118
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:32,200
This is Pokpa 07. Copy that, over. Prod!

119
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:36,360
Huh? / Take it over.

120
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:37,680
Where are you going?

121
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:39,840
Hem!

122
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:04,840
INTERN

123
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:05,920
Here.

124
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,120
For your stress eating.

125
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,680
I tried to look into it

126
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:17,040
but I don't know where they went.

127
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:23,000
All I know is that all of the staff went together.

128
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:18,800
<i>Fifa.</i>

129
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,320
<i>You have to figure this out.</i>

130
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:49,320
<i>Think of something, Fifa.</i>

131
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:01,360
<i>It's a relationship system</i>

132
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:03,840
<i>between living organisms and its environment.</i>

133
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:06,720
<i>All things are connected to each other.</i>

134
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:09,520
<i>Coming or leaving, every action matters.</i>

135
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:12,080
Damn it! Still not good enough.

136
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:19,560
<i>I miss you badly.</i>

137
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:27,360
"The Moon is beautiful, isn't it?",

138
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:29,400
it's a confession of love.

139
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:35,720
Japanese people do this to convey they feelings.

140
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,760
Yeah? So what?

141
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:43,920
Well, you know, I asked Padmé that.

142
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:48,080
Can you guess how she responded?

143
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:52,680
She said "The Moon is always beautiful."

144
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:56,440
That means "I already have feelings for you."

145
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:00,480
Interpret it how you like.

146
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:17,280
The Moon is beautiful, isn't it? / It is.

147
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,280
It's even more beautiful from this angle.

148
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:23,240
Hey.

149
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:26,320
What?

150
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:43,440
Why did you ask me that?

151
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:48,400
I just notice it

152
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:50,920
when you sit here.

153
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:55,080
The Moon is really beautiful, isn't it?

154
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:22,120
Hem,

155
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:24,280
I'm trying to

156
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:27,040
look for the rabbit on the Moon.

157
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:29,840
But...

158
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,440
I can never see it. How do people spot it?

159
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:38,240
I spot it.

160
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:41,360
Really? / Yeah.

161
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:43,840
Where is it?

162
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:45,360
There!

163
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:50,200
Where?

164
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:52,320
There. You see? / Where are you pointing at?

165
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,040
There!

166
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:57,160
I don't see it.

167
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:58,240
See? / I can't...

168
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:01,080
Can't you see?

169
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:17,160
It's huge. Can't you see it?

170
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:19,280
Are you having fun?

171
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,280
It must have jumped down here.

172
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:29,400
Unbelievable.

173
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:43,760
The Moon is beautiful, isn't it?

174
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:48,480
Yeah?

175
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:52,080
There's nothing special about it.

176
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:54,120
I've seen better.

177
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:07,760
Let's go, Prod.

178
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:09,440
They must have been near. / Hold on.

179
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:11,800
We should wait for reinforcements.

180
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:13,320
We have no intel about them.

181
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:15,800
It will be too late.

182
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:17,800
We can't wait. Let's go!

183
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:20,320
Faster! / Yes, sir.

184
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:23,200
We must move before sunrise. / We're on it.

185
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:30,240
Great! We got a huge one.

186
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:39,120
Let's go. We'll have Thomas butcher it.

187
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:41,560
Edward, scout the area ahead.

188
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:47,760
Let's do it.

189
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:26,280
Hey!

190
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:36,320
Hey!

191
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:48,160
Shit!

192
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,360
Freeze! / Damn it!

193
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:06,800
Stop!

194
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:09,520
Stop! Get down!

195
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:12,240
Hold him down.

196
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:33,640
Hem! / Hey.

197
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:35,280
Hey. Don't move!

198
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:37,560
Are you okay?

199
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:16,760
What happened?

200
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:20,280
The poachers.

201
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:23,800
But I'm fine! / How could you say that?

202
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:26,720
It could have been worse.

203
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:31,240
Hey, don't worry. I'm here in one piece.

204
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:36,680
Don't do this, okay?

205
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:41,280
Just don't disappear again.

206
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:49,000
Are you sure you can walk? / This is nothing.

207
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:51,880
Hey.

208
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:53,640
Be still.

209
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:55,800
I'll find some crutches.

210
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:57,920
Lay down. / I said I'm fine.

211
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,960
Let me look in the storage.

212
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:02,520
Just don't move.

213
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,640
Why are you still standing?

214
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:29,480
Come here.

215
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:34,880
I can't find any crutches.

216
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:38,800
Just lean on me.

217
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:47,720
Does it hurt? / A bit.

218
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:50,240
Be gentle.

219
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:55,320
Let's go.

220
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:00,160
Careful now.

221
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:10,080
Let's go.

222
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:27,720
Can you get down? Be careful.

223
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:29,640
Ouch, my dominant leg.

224
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:39,960
Come on.

225
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:43,600
Lean on me.

226
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,840
Let me carry you.

227
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:03,960
I can walk.

228
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:09,040
I knew it. See?

229
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:12,320
See what I mean?

230
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:16,680
Come on. I can't have you falling into the river.

231
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:42,840
Sit down. / It hurts!

232
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:44,520
Are you all right?

233
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:49,600
You sure are heavy.

234
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:56,120
Gotta find some crutches.

235
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:59,080
I don't want to be stuck with you all day.

236
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:01,440
It's uncomfortable.

237
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:07,880
That damn gecko won't even leave me alone.

238
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:11,680
You're complaining non-stop.

239
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:14,800
You must be hungry. I'll fix something up.

240
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:30,640
Hey. Don't stand up. Sit down. / Come on.

241
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:34,440
Just lay still. / I can still do things.

242
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:36,040
I'm going to get some fruits.

243
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:38,680
I can... / How? Just stay here.

244
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:40,200
I can hop there.

245
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:42,960
You'll only hurt yourself more.

246
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:45,720
Just don't move.

247
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:01,720
Have some water.

248
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:42,200
Hem.

249
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:47,560
Where are your shoes?

250
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,240
I left them back there.

251
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:51,480
It'll be fine. / No! My floor will be all dirty.

252
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:53,200
Just help me get up there, okay?

253
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:54,960
Fine! Hop on my back.

254
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:56,400
Your back? / Yes.

255
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:58,640
No. / I don't want my floor to be dirty!

256
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:01,120
Don't complicate things. / Come here.

257
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:03,720
I didn't ask for this! / Just be still!

258
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:07,600
Be still. I don't want to fall to my death.

259
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:11,520
You can just hold my arm...

260
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:13,320
Then wear your shoes next time!

261
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:15,240
It's not that far!

262
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:18,160
Be careful. It hurts!

263
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:28,880
You got lucky that you didn't get hit

264
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:30,840
by a truck when you fell.

265
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:37,560
You got lucky that those poachers

266
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:38,480
didn't carry grenades.

267
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:57,520
What? What's this?

268
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:03,000
Go sleep on your bed.

269
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:04,440
I want to sleep on a nice mattress.

270
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:06,840
And it's my bed.

271
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:18,600
I'll just sleep there.

272
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:17,600
Go to sleep.

273
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:29,160
<i>There is nothing</i>

274
00:44:30,120 --> 00:44:35,040
<i>That can limit us</i>

275
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:40,280
<i>We don't need a reason</i>

276
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:46,520
<i>To be together</i>

277
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:51,560
<i>We are not different</i>

278
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:56,640
<i>We have things in common</i>

279
00:44:56,720 --> 00:45:02,040
<i>Kindred hearts are why we bond</i>

280
00:45:02,120 --> 00:45:07,080
<i>That is all we need</i>

281
00:45:54,080 --> 00:45:58,080
<i>We are not different</i>

282
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:03,280
<i>We have things in common</i>

283
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:08,680
<i>Kindred hearts are why we bond</i>

284
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:13,760
<i>That is all we need</i>

285
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:19,280
<i>We have each other</i>

286
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:24,240
<i>I will never leave your side</i>

287
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:30,000
<i>Your heart and mine</i>

288
00:46:30,080 --> 00:46:35,640
<i>Nothing can come between us</i>

289
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:42,680
Did I wake you up?

290
00:46:45,640 --> 00:46:46,560
No.

291
00:46:48,040 --> 00:46:49,680
You should go wash up.

292
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:53,280
Let me help.

293
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:04,640
<i>We have each other</i>

294
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:09,360
<i>I will never leave your side</i>

295
00:47:11,360 --> 00:47:15,280
<i>Your heart and mine</i>

296
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:22,800
<i>Nothing can come between us</i>

297
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:24,600
You go first.

298
00:47:52,520 --> 00:47:53,920
Will you be ok...

299
00:47:59,360 --> 00:48:00,280
Be careful.

300
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:03,840
Watch me.

301
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:05,480
I'll show you.

302
00:48:14,080 --> 00:48:15,000
Easy.

303
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:17,920
Can you walk from now?

304
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:19,800
I guess.

305
00:48:22,680 --> 00:48:23,720
Hold on.

306
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:26,920
There you go.

307
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:00,320
<i>Whenever I'm feeling down,</i>

308
00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:02,680
<i>I'll hang around this place.</i>

309
00:49:08,680 --> 00:49:12,600
<i>We have each other</i>

310
00:49:12,680 --> 00:49:17,040
<i>I will never leave your side</i>

311
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:22,840
<i>Your heart and mine</i>

312
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:29,080
<i>Nothing can come between us</i>

313
00:52:27,720 --> 00:52:29,720
