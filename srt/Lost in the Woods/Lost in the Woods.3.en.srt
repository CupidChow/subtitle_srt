00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The story, all names, characters, and incidents

2
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:07,080
portrayed in this production are fictitious.

3
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:08,360
No identification with actual persons (living or deceased),

4
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:09,920
places, buildings, and products is intended or should be inferred.

5
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:31,840
Here's your lunch.

6
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,080
Come on, take it.

7
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:44,160
Eat it up.

8
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:47,120
I'll leave it here. Eat it, okay?

9
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:54,080
Gosh.

10
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:01,160
You didn't eat yesterday's portion?

11
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,440
Don't skip meals!

12
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:06,880
Just leave it! I'll eat when I'm hungry.

13
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:12,160
You have to eat it.

14
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:14,280
Have your meal now.

15
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:18,480
Stop bother... / You're hungry. I knew it.

16
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:53,320
See?

17
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:55,400
You needed to eat something.

18
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,600
When you're starving,

19
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:01,120
your brain will trick you into forgetting you're hungry.

20
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:04,360
But when it senses food in your system,

21
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,840
you will feel a sudden hunger

22
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:10,080
as if it's telling you that you really need to eat.

23
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:12,520
As soon as you have your first bite,

24
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,760
you'll realize that you are starving.

25
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,640
Believe me now?

26
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:23,840
What's wrong?

27
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,320
Help me, Hem.

28
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,120
Any cloth to make a tourniquet?

29
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:39,360
Your shirt! Can we rip it?

30
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,560
Be gentle!

31
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,000
Seriously, I could die!

32
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,240
Hem... / Be still!

33
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,760
Tourniquet is unnecessary.

34
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:51,040
It will only complicate your injury.

35
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,320
But the snake... It has fangs.

36
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,480
If it has fangs, that means it's venomous.

37
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:59,640
Right? / But a sunbeam snake is not venomous.

38
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,400
Stay still.

39
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:04,440
Ouch!

40
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,440
Too soon.

41
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,640
Hey, hey. What are you doing?

42
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:10,560
Ouch! It hurts.

43
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:11,640
Hey!

44
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,280
Let me go.

45
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:16,160
I told you to be still.

46
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,240
Okay.

47
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,800
Be careful.

48
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,560
Done.

49
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:43,920
Thank you.

50
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:53,200
Shit. It's already seven.

51
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,320
I need to run.

52
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,680
What's the rush? Your shift starts at eight.

53
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,640
I'm off now. I have to meet up with Padmé.

54
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,240
Are you going to work?

55
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:23,280
Don't skip your meal, okay? You need energy.

56
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:26,760
See you later.

57
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,120
Mind your step.

58
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,360
Okay.

59
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,000
Padmé. / Yeah?

60
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:53,360
I think you look good already.

61
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,200
Just be confident in yourself.

62
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:58,880
You can wear any outfits you want.

63
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,080
Mix and match style.

64
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,080
Try this.

65
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:06,720
Okay.

66
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:12,000
I like something colorful with patterns.

67
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:16,480
They each look good on their own.

68
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,560
I'll see what I can do.

69
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:38,600
Perfect.

70
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:39,920
Nice! / I approve this.

71
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,520
This is it.

72
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,920
<i>I started to feel that</i>

73
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,840
<i>things aren't as bad as I thought they were.</i>

74
00:06:55,800 --> 00:07:00,560
<i>You'll surely learn a thing or two if you just open up.</i>

75
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:01,640
Hello, Aunty Kaew.

76
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:03,880
Here's your lunchbox.

77
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,760
KAEW

78
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,560
<i>But the catch is...</i>

79
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:23,480
<i>It takes time</i>

80
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,200
<i>for some people</i>

81
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:32,000
<i>to trust in you.</i>

82
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,640
You can start the car.

83
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:46,840
Give me a minute. / Okay.

84
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,160
Come on, Fifa!

85
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:54,800
Are you all right?

86
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:05,360
Padmé. I need a short break.

87
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,400
I have a meeting.

88
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,440
Okay.

89
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:10,240
ROAD CLOSED

90
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:03,680
Damn it!

91
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:09,960
Ouch, ouch!

92
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:04,720
Shit.

93
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:30,960
Come on, guys.

94
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:38,080
This year's wildfire started sooner than expected.

95
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:40,560
We were lucky enough that the wildfire last week

96
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:43,320
didn't cross our firebreak.

97
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,480
But we can't lower our guard.

98
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:47,440
Tee. / Yes?

99
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:50,000
See if you can speed up the progress on the left side.

100
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,040
I will.

101
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,920
Tim, focus on salt licks

102
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,440
from the left side to here.

103
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:55,600
Pepsi, you take C zone.

104
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:57,920
I'm on it. / Let's go.

105
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:07,080
Wildfires usually start on a hill.

106
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:10,480
Why does it start

107
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,320
on this area instead?

108
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,440
Something's off.

109
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,560
It's not harvest season.

110
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:26,040
There are no villagers in that area.

111
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,560
I don't think it's the villagers.

112
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:39,040
Por, did you get all the documents?

113
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,080
I did.

114
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,840
KAY

115
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,960
KUNG

116
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:25,160
CHECK DAM

117
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,240
I'll leave your lunchboxes here.

118
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:16,760
Can I help with anything?

119
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:17,440
I'm sorry. Really sorry.

120
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:19,360
Are you all right? / I'm sorry.

121
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,760
Are you okay? / Are you hurt?

122
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:24,080
I'm really sorry. Are you hurt?

123
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:25,480
I'll take you to the command center.

124
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:26,440
Okay.

125
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:27,880
Please continue with your work.

126
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,800
I'm really sorry.

127
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:03,480
CHECK DAM

128
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:08,520
CHECK DAM

129
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:19,520
Love it already? / Whoa!

130
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:20,480
It's you, Hem.

131
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,920
Why recording it when you can listen to the real thing?

132
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:29,080
It's none of your concern.

133
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:33,200
I need to go.

134
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:36,600
Wait! / Whoa, whoa!

135
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,320
A close call.

136
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,280
<i>He seems kind.</i>

137
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:17,480
You should head back.

138
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:19,560
Huh?

139
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:21,680
What about you?

140
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:23,440
I will stay here.

141
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:25,720
I'll do a moon-viewing tonight.

142
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:28,280
<i>Sick!</i>

143
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:34,280
In that case...

144
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,120
Can I stay with you here?

145
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:42,880
I just want

146
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:45,080
to record nature sounds at night.

147
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:49,240
Please, Uncle Hem.

148
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:50,680
I'll do just that.

149
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:51,840
I promise

150
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:55,200
not to be a nuisance or disturb you.

151
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,360
Are you going to keep calling me Uncle?

152
00:24:58,680 --> 00:24:59,600
Hem.

153
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,600
Forest ambience during day and night

154
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:07,560
are totally different.

155
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,320
They are

156
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:12,760
both serene...

157
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:14,840
But different.

158
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:53,360
Didn't know I was this hungry.

159
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,600
I couldn't eat a hard-boiled egg

160
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:03,680
without a condiment.

161
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,080
It's too dry. But hunger got the best of me today.

162
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:12,560
Why don't you eat?

163
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:14,400
I finished mine.

164
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:21,880
You ventured this far with only two hard-boiled eggs?

165
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:26,400
How many should I bring then?

166
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:43,000
What?

167
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:44,680
Eggshells.

168
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:47,800
They keep snails away.

169
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:51,440
One less excuse for you to bother me

170
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,960
so I can get a good night's sleep.

171
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:57,760
How's the bite on your leg?

172
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:02,080
Right!

173
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:05,800
I was so busy I forgot about it.

174
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:09,120
It...

175
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:11,240
doesn't hurt as much.

176
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:57,480
Hem.

177
00:27:58,120 --> 00:27:59,200
Do you...

178
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:01,960
have any dreams you want to one day achieve?

179
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:03,320
I don't.

180
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:06,920
I didn't mean to intrude.

181
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:21,080
What are your dreams?

182
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:27,920
My dreams?

183
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:33,040
I want...

184
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:38,840
to achieve things on my own.

185
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:49,600
The harder things are,

186
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:53,280
the more challenging they get. And I want to overcome them.

187
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:01,200
Actually,

188
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:04,640
I applied for a scholarship in Japan.

189
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:06,760
The results will be out next week.

190
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:11,320
I really, really want that.

191
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:27,160
My dream was similar to yours.

192
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:33,960
My parents wanted me to go study in America.

193
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:38,560
But I chose to be here, in Chiang Mai.

194
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:48,480
You remind me of my old self.

195
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:03,880
Thank you

196
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:07,200
for telling me that.

197
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:48,280
Ouch!

198
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:02,320
Hem.

199
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:04,680
What are you doing?

200
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:07,440
Making natural water filters.

201
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:09,360
Come here and try it.

202
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:11,760
What?

203
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:38,920
No way. I'll pass.

204
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,320
If you don't try it,

205
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:42,600
how will you know if it's undrinkable?

206
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:45,280
Come on.

207
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:46,720
Try it.

208
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:54,080
Right there. / That's it.

209
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:03,720
Whoa!

210
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:06,520
Your water...

211
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:08,960
is delicious!

212
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:10,760
Right? / Yeah.

213
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:12,680
It's easy to make too.

214
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:14,440
I used charcoals and minerals.

215
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:16,440
If we have sand here, it'll be better.

216
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:47,320
Huh?

217
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:04,880
Hem.

218
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:08,960
Can I

219
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:10,600
borrow you walkie-talkie?

220
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:22,360
Pokpa 08, this is Pokpa 03. Come in, over.

221
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:26,360
<i>This is Pokpa 08. What's up, Fifa?</i>

222
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:28,720
Hey, Padmé. Well...

223
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:32,240
Can you cover my deliveries later?

224
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:36,000
I'm going to help the check dam group today.

225
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:37,040
<i>Sure.</i>

226
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:38,040
Okay.

227
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:39,440
Great!

228
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:41,280
Okay.

229
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:09,080
<i>Where there's a will, there's a way.</i>

230
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:13,880
<i>If you want to gain someone's trust,</i>

231
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:17,680
<i>use your actions, not your words.</i>

232
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:52,320
Prod!

233
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:57,040
I'll leave it here, okay?

234
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:09,600
RED OAK LETTUCE

235
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:18,960
Hi. / Hello. Here's your lunch.

236
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:20,840
That's all, Dit. / I'll be off then.

237
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:21,760
Okay.

238
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:24,040
Aunty Kaew.

239
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:26,400
Here's your lunch.

240
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:33,520
Have a pleasant meal.

241
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:35,360
I will.

242
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:59,200
<i>Could it be... the forest spirit is guiding me?</i>

243
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:00,720
<i>I am lost</i>

244
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:04,160
<i>Anybody can see. This tell-tale heart of mine</i>

245
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:08,640
<i>I am lost</i>

246
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:12,240
<i>I am blushing. My heart does not lie</i>

247
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:20,200
<i>Exploring his heart</i>

248
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:21,280
I'm good.

249
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:26,720
<i>Looking around and calling dibs on him</i>

250
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:34,520
<i>I am lost in the woods. But I am in no hurry to get out…</i>

251
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:39,440
<i>Pretending to be afraid, shaking in fear</i>

252
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:42,400
<i>But I actually love this</i>

253
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:48,680
<i>I am lost</i>

254
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:52,080
<i>Anybody can see. This tell-tale heart of mine</i>

255
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:56,640
<i>I am lost</i>

256
00:36:56,720 --> 00:37:00,080
<i>And blushing. My heart does not lie</i>

257
00:37:58,360 --> 00:37:59,960
You are an hour late.

258
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:01,080
Hey!

259
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:02,600
Hey!

260
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:04,280
Are you all right?

261
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:45,720
Damn me.

262
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:24,320
You want this?

263
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:36,840
Thank you.

264
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:43,040
Right.

265
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:50,120
Why did you choose to be here?

266
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:02,440
If I have to live my life in solitude like this,

267
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:05,040
I'll definitely go crazy.

268
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:07,160
I'm actually...

269
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:10,000
thinking about my life in Japan already.

270
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:13,280
I'll definitely love it there.

271
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:16,800
Japan has this modern vibe, you know,

272
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:18,880
and a traditional living style and culture.

273
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:20,320
But when they come together?

274
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:22,240
It's perfect.

275
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:24,600
Yeah. / Have you been there?

276
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:26,520
Yeah.

277
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:28,360
You're super chatty.

278
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:30,360
What?

279
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:33,920
Ugh! I don't get you.

280
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:34,960
Follow me.

281
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:36,640
To where?

282
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:40,160
To where, Hem?

283
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:54,880
You know, forest has its own ecosystem management system.

284
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:56,440
And they thrive wondrously.

285
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:58,040
Hey.

286
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:01,960
What is "ecosystem" anyway?

287
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,680
I think I've heard of it

288
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:06,680
but I don't know what it means.

289
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:09,240
It's a relationship system

290
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:11,760
between living organisms and its environment.

291
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,840
Look around you.

292
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:23,120
We are now part of the system.

293
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:25,320
Not just you and me

294
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:28,920
but also trees, air, and earth.

295
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:32,200
They affect each other.

296
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:37,600
The occurrence of one thing will affect countless things.

297
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:41,160
Think of a river.

298
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:42,920
Whether it is full or dry up,

299
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,680
wherever it flows through,

300
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:46,920
whatever minerals it carries

301
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:50,360
or how the minerals affect its quality,

302
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:53,880
these things are all connected.

303
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:09,440
Sit down.

304
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:11,640
Come on.

305
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:14,560
Now, close your eyes. / What?

306
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:15,920
Just do it.

307
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:17,840
Do I need to? / Yeah.

308
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:32,560
Close your eyes.

309
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:42,600
Do you feel it?

310
00:42:56,120 --> 00:42:59,080
The soil is rich because it has moisture.

311
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:02,440
That is because of humidity that rain brings.

312
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:04,720
Many seasons of rain.

313
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:22,360
Feel this.

314
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:28,720
And this soil?

315
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:31,400
This soil is from a wildfire area.

316
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:48,400
I hope everybody realizes

317
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:52,880
that forests affect our lives.

318
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:07,240
Does my coming here

319
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:09,320
affect this forest?

320
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:14,640
You know, in my case,

321
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:17,640
I don't live here.

322
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:21,520
I'm just a visitor.

323
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:38,400
All things are connected to each other.

324
00:44:40,360 --> 00:44:41,840
Coming or leaving.

325
00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:44,680
Every action matters.

326
00:44:52,840 --> 00:44:56,080
When I see trees, plants,

327
00:44:57,960 --> 00:44:59,680
or nature in a great condition,

328
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:04,600
that makes me feel alive.

329
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:17,640
Nature can heal your mind.

330
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:24,720
That's why...

331
00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:28,320
I want to take care of them.

332
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:33,720
This is probably

333
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:38,000
our relationship with nature.

334
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:46,160
I get it.

335
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:50,560
Hem,

336
00:45:51,880 --> 00:45:53,400
I'll head back first.

337
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:12,800
Hem.

338
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:16,480
Thank you.

339
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:23,400
<i>Some people</i>

340
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:26,960

341
00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:57,760
<i>Does my coming here</i>

342

<i>I can't put up with you anymore!</i>

347
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:20,600
Asshole!

A plot from the novel "Lost in the woods" by theneoclassic
