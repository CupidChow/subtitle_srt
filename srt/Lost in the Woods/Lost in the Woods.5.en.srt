15 YEARS AGO

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,520
Don't worry. I'll give you whatever you want.

7
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:17,120
Okay? Don't worry.

8
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:34,880
Hey, Third.

9
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:36,440
Have a seat, dear.

10
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:47,240
I'm so happy for your graduation.

11
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:56,560
Mom. / Yes?

12
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:00,040
I must tell you something.

13
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:17,400
Dad is... / If he is happy with his choice,

14
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:20,080
we must understand him.

15
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:23,000
You know,

16
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,640
we work hard...

17
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,440
years and years

18
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,120
for what?

19
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:31,400
It's all for happiness!

20
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:34,120
That's all, dear.

21
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,560
Life is all about happiness, am I right?

22
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:45,200
You're late.

23
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,080
You want some?

24
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,160
Now that you have graduated,

25
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:06,960
it's about time you go study abroad.

26
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,680
Your mother and I...

27
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:11,920
already arranged everything for you.

28
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:12,880
I won't go.

29
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,360
This is my life, my choice.

30
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:27,920
Your choice?

31
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,040
Third,

32
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:35,960
do you think life is that easy, huh?

33
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:40,160
You are not old enough to understand it.

34
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:42,160
You think you can fend for yourself?

35
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:43,600
Huh?

36
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,200
Huh! / You still have a lot to learn.

37
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,160
Huh!

38
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,640
Dear,

39
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:15,000
do you think Fifa is doing well?

40
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,280
Shall we visit him?

41
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,840
Listen, honey,

42
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,960
my mom forbids us to go there.

43
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:29,280
Come on,

44
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,960
he is going to be fine.

45
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,520
I have been looking for you.

46
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,240
I'm still not over it.

47
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:00,480
I'm sorry.

48
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:29,680
TO NEPAL: I FAIL THE SCHOLARSHIP

49
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:35,840
Fifa,

50
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,280
hop on.

51
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:49,800
Come on.

52
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,800
Running away already?

53
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,120
Such a wuss.

54
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:42,760
You ran away as well.

55
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,240
From a woman.

56
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,360
What about you?

57
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:49,280
Huh?

58
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:54,840
Why did you come to Pokpa?

59
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,320
Didn't you run away from something as well?

60
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,040
Tell me if I'm wrong about that.

61
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,160
Pokpa 07, this is Pokpa 15.

62
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,400
No need to come in today.

63
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:18,160
Mrs. Pat has some business in town.

64
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,640
Come in, over.

65
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:22,040
This is Pokpa 07. Copy that, over.

66
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,880
I'm in a low mood today.

67
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,600
Me too.

68
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:02,280
I encountered someone I didn't want to see.

69
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:07,040
And something I didn't want to see.

70
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:02,560
Hem,

71
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,040
is this area Pokpa as well?

72
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,360
This is an elephant camp.

73
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:15,840
We tend sick elephants here.

74
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,240
Great. It suits my mood now.

75
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,240
Come on.

76
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,120
The woman we met back there,

77
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,480
I think she's cute.

78
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,080
What's her name?

79
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:47,360
Did she call you...

80
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,040
Third?

81
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:06,520
PRAE

82
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,480
THIRD

83
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,240
I'm Third.

84
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,440
I'm from Bangkok.

85
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:23,560
Architecture major.

86
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:26,040
I'm Prae. Medicine major.

87
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,240
I'm from Chiang Mai.

88
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,640
We really look goofy.

89
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:45,360
Boo! / Whoa!

90
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,880
I almost have a heart attack!

91
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:50,880
Are you a prankster?

92
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:52,160
Are you a scaredy-cat?

93
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,680
Happy birthday, Third.

94
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,120
I love you.

95
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:08,480
Tada!

96
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:11,840
May I?

97
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:12,760
Okay.

98
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,000
I won't ever take it off.

99
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:20,840
It that a promise?

100
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:21,760
It is.

101
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,000
I had a very close friend.

102
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:34,480
But...

103
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:43,000
Are you really going to study in England?

104
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,080
Yeah.

105
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,200
A master's degree in architecture.

106
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:49,040
You should apply for residency as well.

107
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,800
Can you not go?

108
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:54,600
Actually,

109
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:58,200
I think I'll find some work when I finish my internship.

110
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:00,800
Prae,

111
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,480
we have just graduated.

112
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:03,960
We should hurry

113
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,440
and get our master's.

114
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,440
Come on. Come with me.

115
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:11,440
Listen,

116
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:12,760
when we get back

117
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,040
we will get married.

118
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:19,800
Oh, oh?

119
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,200
Are you going somewhere,

120
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,840
our future doctor?

121
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,440
You'd better ask him.

122
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,720
He's trying to get me to go study in England with him.

123
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,800
Studying abroad?

124
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:35,400
I'm actually interested in getting a master's

125
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:38,040
in multimedia.

126
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:40,760
That's great! We should all go.

127
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:41,720
Come on, Prae.

128
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:44,600
Don’t listen to Yo. He didn't really mean it.

129
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,400
I mean it. I do.

130
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,560
Come on.

131
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:51,480
I'll drink, but don't mistake that as a yes.

132
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,200
What's up?

133
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:05,520
I'm just pondering.

134
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:08,680
Well,

135
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:10,680
it's not that I don't want to go,

136
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,720
but you know Third.

137
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,240
He's spontaneous.

138
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:17,400
He decides things by himself without discussing with me.

139
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:20,320
He doesn't even care to.

140
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:24,040
You two are together for a long time.

141
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:26,600
That probably makes you feel like friends.

142
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:30,360
But I'm not just a friend.

143
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:33,360
Come on. Don't overthink it.

144
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,560
Hey.

145
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:43,480
Third already left.

146
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:46,280
He texted me to drive you home.

147
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:51,960
Great. Now he texted you instead of me.

148
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:53,920
Didn't even pick up my calls.

149
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:55,520
Come on.

150
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:57,200
You know him.

151
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,800
Must I get used to it?

152
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,440
You always take care of me.

153
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:33,440
Right?

154
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:38,320
I have fun when I'm with you.

155
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,000
Is that all?

156
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,640
Hey, I'm not like that.

157
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:23,000
Damn.

158
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:24,720
Is that true?

159
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,720
Why is it always you.

160
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:35,760
Actually,

161
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:38,200
he should have been here with me.

162
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:49,720
Prae...

163
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:01,960
I'm not okay with this.

164
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:05,320
How many times has he done this to me?

165
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:10,080
He's just like that.

166
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:25,360
You two will sort it out. Don't worry.

167
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:29,760
Yeah.

168
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:05,880
You should let her go.

169
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:10,800
Why do you still care

170
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,480
about someone that hurt you?

171
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,360
Hem,

172
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:33,440
can I try your drink?

173
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:36,040
I want to warm up a little.

174
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:38,560
Have at it.

175
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:53,560
Yuck!

176
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,280
Whoa!

177
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,480
Ha!

178
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,400
My throat! It fricking burns!

179
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:09,960
Why kind of drink is this!

180
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:13,840
This will definitely kill you someday.

181
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,040
Be kind to your liver.

182
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,280
This kind of drink will get you going.

183
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:19,440
I like it strong.

184
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:21,600
Blegh!

185
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:24,040
I give up.

186
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,400
Try this.

187
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:27,920
What's this?

188
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:30,080
The locals brewed it.

189
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:32,160
It's smooth.

190
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:33,080
Are you sure?

191
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,000
Yeah.

192
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:48,560
Phew.

193
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,000
This is better.

194
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:51,640
It's a luxury drink

195
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:54,960
compared to that barbaric one of yours.

196
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:55,880
Urgh!

197
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:06,520
Thank you for telling me.

198
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,120
You cheer up as well.

199
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,120
Thank you.

200
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:57,800
Nature calls.

201
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,760
Your Grandma and I had a talk.

202
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:21,920
She wants you to take over Pokpa.

203
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:18,120
Get me out of here!

204
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:24,880
I want to leave this place!

205
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:54,120
Fifa.

206
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:01,160
Fifa.

207
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:02,160
Hey.

208
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:04,120
Come on.

209
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:05,560
Come on.

210
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:13,240
How can you be this heavy?

211
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:43,120
Hey, get up.

212
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:20,960
What?

213
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:22,720
What's wrong?

214
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:27,880
I'm...

215
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:29,840
I'm hungover.

216
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:31,800
Serve you right.

217
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,040
Remember this.

218
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:36,920
No liquors

219
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,160
can heal you.

220
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:43,480
Look who's talking.

221
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:49,200
Let's go.

222
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:00,720
Can you get up? / Yeah.

223
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:08,080
Still hungover?

224
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:11,480
A little headache. My mind is still numb.

225
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:11,000
I am lost

226
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:14,400
Anybody can see, this tell-tale heart of mine

227
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:19,000
I am lost

228
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:22,240
And blushing. My heart does not lie

229
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,320
How's that? Refreshingly cold?

230
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:33,120
It's cold, but not refreshing.

231
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:34,440
Then take this! / Whoa!

232
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:39,560
A splash of cold water is a good hangover cure.

233
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:44,320
Let the water wash your worries away.

234
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:07,040
Not cold anymore?

235
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:57,120
Can you apply

236
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,640
for another scholarship?

237
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:04,800
There is one opening up

238
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:08,360
but it requires a portfolio.

239
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:10,600
And that scholarship

240
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,760
attracts a lot of strong applicants.

241
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:15,720
I can't beat them.

242
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,280
I'm losing my confidence.

243
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:21,480
If it's really important to you,

244
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:24,920
you should fear nothing...

245
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:29,360
but being unable to go to Japan.

246
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:36,120
Well,

247
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:39,720
I have never done any serious project before.

248
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:44,720
I have lots of work here as well.

249
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,120
I won't have time for that.

250
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:49,640
There are people

251
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:52,920
who will help you with your work here.

252
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:55,600
Listen,

253
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:57,840
the most important chance

254
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:01,000
is the second chance.

255
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:12,120
You know it well.

256
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:15,040
Fear is a common feeling.

257
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:18,520
If you can overcome it,

258
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:21,000
nothing can ever stop you.

259
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:23,440
I'll help you.

260
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:33,400
Tell Mrs. Pat about it

261
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:35,880
and prepare yourself.

262
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:38,960
Handling both your work and scholarship will not be easy.

263
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:02,040
God.

264
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:04,880
I can't believe you.

265
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:07,200
A master drinker.

266
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:11,440
Want some?

267
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:14,920
Thank you,

268
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,000
but I'm good.

269
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:18,480
Yeah.

270
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:19,960
I'm good as well.

271
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:22,440
It just helps me sleep.

272
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:35,880
So to speak,

273
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:37,920
I failed

274
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:39,880
my scholarship.

275
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:44,640
You failed a relationship.

276
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:49,760
You should move forward

277
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:54,040
and seek a second chance like you told me to.

278
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:58,200
You don't understand it.

279
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:13,360
Jeez...

280
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:16,400
Do you even love yourself?

281
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:19,320
I do.

282
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:20,760
And I ended up like this.

283
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,360
Honestly,

284
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:40,400
no one talks to me that way.

285
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:45,240
That kind of nagging.

286
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:55,320
But I know you mean well.

287
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:01,360
I do.

288
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:05,400
I do mean very well.

289
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:11,440
I don't want to see you sad.

290
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:21,600
For me?

291
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:24,600
You are awesome.

292
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:26,320
Like,

293
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:28,440
super cool, bad ass kind of guy.

294
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:30,200
It's almost like

295
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:32,920
even wild animals would be in awe of you.

296
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:35,440
Are you messing with me?

297
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:37,240
I wouldn't dare.

298
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:46,520
Hey,

299
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:50,080
you're a good guy.

300
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:52,800
I see it

301
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:55,480
that you always help those in need.

302
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:58,360
You even helped...

303
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:00,960
someone like me.

304
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:08,400
You just...

305
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:12,080
don't help yourself enough.

306
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:25,040
If I were a woman,

307
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:27,200
I would probably go after you.

308
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:38,680
Well, you are actually

309
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:40,080
a nice kid.

310
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:41,560
Kind of.

311
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:45,120
I can see your determination.

312
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:49,440
The song you played for me?

313
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:51,560
It's super good.

314
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:55,240
If I were a woman,

315
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:57,880
I would go after you as well.

316
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:03,600
We have each other

317
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:08,680
I will never leave your side

318
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:14,320
Your heart and mine

319
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:20,600
Nothing can come between us

320
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:34,280
That's it.

321
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:36,920
I'm going to bed. So sleepy.

322
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:38,600
Okay.

323
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:40,120
Good night.

324
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:43,320
And go easy on it.

325
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:14,600
We have each other

326
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:19,880
I will never leave your side

327
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:25,320
Your heart and mine

328
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:32,320
Nothing can come between us

329
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:49,760
Yo,

330
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:51,360
I know you like Prae.

331
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:52,800
You bastard!

332
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:55,080
I thought you might do something

333
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:58,520
But I never expected this!

334
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:00,120
How can you do you this to me?

335
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:01,360
Don't let me get started.

336
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:02,560
You're...

337
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:04,840
A scumbag.

338
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:07,960
I can't put up with you anymore.

339
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:13,280
What's wrong with you!

340
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:15,840
Prae!

341
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:23,360
Prae.

342
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:24,680
Prae!

343
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:27,240
Hey, I'm sorry.

344
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:29,280
Asshole!

345
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:55,520
Hem!

346
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:01,000
What's wrong?

347
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:04,640
Hem.

348
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:28,400
What?

349
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:35,720
I'm sorry.

350
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:39,280
I just heard you cry.

351
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:41,560
I'm okay.

352
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:44,320
I drank too much.

353
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:47,800
I warned you.

354
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:51,760
You should go back to sleep.

355
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:55,960
Just go.

356
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:05,680
What are you wondering about?

357
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:12,920
Nothing. I just...

358
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:15,320
I'm thinking about...

359
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:17,560
what I should say to Grandma.

360
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,080
I was thinking about what happened last night.

361
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:32,640
Come on. Let's go see her.

362
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:53,000
I won't allow it!

363
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:59,320
What did I ask you to do here?

364
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:02,400
Grandma,

365
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:05,280
you know,

366
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:09,800
I promise

367
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:12,520
I will be responsible.

368
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:21,880
Does he start to love this place or what?

369
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:22,800
Grandma,

370
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:26,800
I don't think it's just all about that.

371
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:29,680
I think it won't affect his performance here

372
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:32,440
if he can manage his schedule.

373
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:37,280
When did you start taking his side?

374
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:46,400
The next duty you'll be assigned to...

375
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:53,320
You have to work with the volunteers here.

376
00:40:58,920 --> 00:40:59,840
I gladly accept.

377
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:06,000
Grandma,

378
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:08,760
you know, I have one more request.

379
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:14,360
Can I move into Hem's office?

380
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:18,160
You'll only bother him.

381
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:19,360
I'm fine with that!

382
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:21,920
I'll help take care of him.

383
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:28,920
Guess I'll leave him in your care.

384
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:35,000
If you'll excuse me.

385
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:36,760
Ma'am.

386
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:39,000
Thank you, Grandma.

387
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:44,320
A heads up next time.

388
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:56,520
Are you happy now?

389
00:41:58,520 --> 00:41:59,440
Isn't it good?

390
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:02,280
From now on,

391
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:04,600
just give it your best shot.

392
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:06,480
I'll support you.

393
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:29,680
Hem!

394
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:34,880
You go unpack first.

395
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:41,760
Wait here when you're finished.

396
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:42,680
I'll be back.

397
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:10,120
We have each other

398
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:15,360
I will never leave your side

399
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:20,920
Your heart and mine

400
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:27,320
Nothing can come between us

401
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:36,320
Where can we escape from reality

402
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:39,040
How can we do it

403
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:57,280
Looking at the morning sky

404
00:43:57,360 --> 00:43:59,560
Could not lift up my spirit

405
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:04,640
Better than looking at your smile

406
00:44:06,360 --> 00:44:09,320
The wind passing by

407
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:11,480
Could not make me as ticklish

408
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:16,800
As you being by my side

409
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:22,720
You bring the change of seasons

410
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:29,000
A lonely season is gone

411
00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:36,080
A loving season was born

412
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:40,600
With you by my side

413
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:46,040
I start to see the color

414
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:49,720
Of love and passion

415
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:56,080
And I wish it lasts forever

416
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:09,280
A songbird's singing

417
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:11,560
Is far less enticing

418
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:17,280
Than your whispering that you miss me.

419
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:21,200
Love is a meaningful word

420
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:23,520
But it would not impress anyone

421
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:28,760
I could only say it to you

422
00:45:28,840 --> 00:45:34,800
You bring the change of seasons

423
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:40,800
A lonely season is gone

424
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:47,880
A loving season was born

425
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:52,640
With you by my side

426
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:57,960
I start to see the color

427
00:45:58,040 --> 00:46:01,760
Of love and passion

428
00:46:01,840 --> 00:46:05,520
In every season of love

429
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:10,680
Being with you in this great atmosphere

430
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:17,040
With trees, rivers, and mountains near

431
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:23,480
I am blessed to have found you

432
00:46:23,560 --> 00:46:26,920
To be able to get close and love you

433
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:27,960
A plot from the novel "Lost in the woods" by theneoclassic

434
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:35,400
And I wish it lasts forever
