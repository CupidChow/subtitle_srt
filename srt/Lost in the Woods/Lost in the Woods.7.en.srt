1
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,079
The story, all names, characters, and incidents

2
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:07,399
portrayed in this production are fictitious.

3
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:08,719
No identification with actual persons (living or deceased),

4
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:09,920
places, buildings, and products is intended or should be inferred.

5
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:28,920
Are you really leaving then?

6
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:44,240
Do you want me not to?

7
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:48,680
Well, I know you have to go.

8
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,480
It's your dream, right?

9
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:54,480
Yeah.

10
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:00,960
I'll help you get ready.

11
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:07,960
Come on.

12
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:09,840
Let's do it!

13
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:11,640
Yeah.

14
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:13,160
Hold onto me.

15
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,320
Let's eat.

16
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,160
Wait for me here.

17
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:50,520
I'm meeting Mrs. Pat first.

18
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,960
Okay. See you around.

19
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,040
I've warned you countless times

20
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:38,720
to not be reckless with poachers.

21
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,320
You should've waited for reinforcements.

22
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,240
You're not trained for a shootout!

23
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,960
That was a selfish decision you made.

24
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,600
You didn't think of other people.

25
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:00,720
What if something happened to Prod, or the others?

26
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:03,560
How would their families feel?

27
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,880
I'm sorry.

28
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,840
It's already hard enough to protect the forest.

29
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:37,680
But it's harder to protect the protectors.

30
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:43,880
The value of a person who protects the forest

31
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:46,280
is immeasurable

32
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:49,560
because they protect something invaluable.

33
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:57,240
Do you know how much we worry about you?

34
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,920
Everybody here loves you,

35
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,920
even Fifa does.

36
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,240
On that night,

37
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,120
he stayed up waiting for you

38
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:16,160
and rushed out to find you in the morning.
That was probably why he fell.

39
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,040
Don't you see that he cares about you?

40
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:28,480
Treat yourself better

41
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:38,800
so you can treat others as such.

42
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:06,680
How did it go?

43
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,200
A two-week suspension.

44
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,400
For you as well.

45
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,240
I'm sorry.

46
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,160
I was really reckless.

47
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:37,960
Come on.

48
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:40,360
Don't worry. I know you, you meant well.

49
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,760
Padmé and Fifa just left.

50
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,760
Did they go into town?

51
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:54,720
He wants you to pick him up at Yayee in the evening.

52
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:58,760
Let's go.

53
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,960
Please check the delivery and sign here.

54
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:11,040
Okay. / Thank you.

55
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,280
Done?

56
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,960
How are you holding up? Better?

57
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,040
Yeah.

58
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:20,800
I'm feeling better.

59
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:24,600
Hold on.

60
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,160
I invited my friend here.

61
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,720
Who? / She should be here any minute.

62
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:33,840
You didn't tell me!

63
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:38,280
Nepal! This way! / Hi!

64
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,680
Let me introduce you to each other.

65
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:44,120
This is Padmé. / Okay.

66
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:46,160
A friend I met here. / Hi. I'm Padmé.

67
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:50,120
Hello. / This is my old friend, Nepal.

68
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:53,120
Nepal? / I'm your "old" friend now?

69
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:58,320
I mean a good old friend. The original gang!

70
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:00,200
What happened to your leg?

71
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:02,040
I got a sprained ankle.

72
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:04,840
I'm doing fine. Padmé gave me these crutches.

73
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:08,320
A sprained ankle, I see.

74
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,360
Padmé,

75
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,800
are these from Pokpa?

76
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,920
They are.

77
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:17,640
I saw them in the storage.

78
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,200
I can't find any crutches.

79
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,680
Just lean on me.

80
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,760
Fifa! / Yes?

81
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,960
What exactly did you invite me here for?

82
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:42,920
Well,

83
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,240
I think...

84
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,760
I have something to tell you.

85
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:56,160
It's that...

86
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:00,800
I have...

87
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
someone I like.

88
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,040
What? / What?

89
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:06,040
Why are you so surprised?

90
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:09,400
Spill it. Spare no detail.

91
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:13,680
You see,

92
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:17,960
I don't know if I really like that person.

93
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,400
Do you know that moment

94
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,760
when you see things...

95
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,320
differently?

96
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:32,080
Things that used to be ordinary to you.

97
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:37,640
Don't laugh! / I feel you.

98
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:38,800
You do?

99
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,920
It won't be the same whenever I look up to the Moon.

100
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:53,600
Ever since I learned about
the Japanese meaning of moon-viewing

101
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:57,520
and got asked about the beauty of the Moon

102
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:01,080
by someone that I love,

103
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:07,280
the Moon has much more meaning to me.

104
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,800
Do you feel me?

105
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,320
What are you two even talking about?

106
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,840
Don't you get it?

107
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,240
Tell me who that is.

108
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:20,680
Tell me.

109
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,160
It's Uncle Hem!

110
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:45,960
Hold them, will you?

111
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:50,880
Come on.

112
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,640
See you later, Nepal. / Okay.

113
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,440
See you later. / Bye.

114
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:56,840
Good bye, Prod. / Bye.

115
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:58,040
So much for waiting.

116
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,200
I came to see my friend.

117
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,400
You can't even walk straight.

118
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:07,999
I am lost

119
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,200
And blushing. My heart does not lie

120
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,680
I should've chosen a friendlier place.

121
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,200
Serves you right.

122
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:26,400
And whose fault is that?

123
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:29,120
Your fault.

124
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,640
Wow.

125
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:31,960
This is it.

126
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:40,120
Give me my sketchbook and pencil.

127
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,800
Bossy bastard. / Hurry up.

128
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,240
Here.

129
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,240
Are you kidding me? / Take it.

130
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,280
Hey. Don't look.

131
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,560
Block sunlight for me, will you?

132
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:03,720
Am I a joke to you?

133
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:06,000
Try standing behind that log.

134
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:09,760
Come on. You said you would help me. And be still.

135
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,200
Now make a cool pose.

136
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:15,480
Make it fierce, okay?

137
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:18,160
Don't move.

138
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,120
You must look cool in this.

139
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,960
That's better.

140
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,440
Be still.

141
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:29,920
Do I really look cool? / Yes.

142
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:31,320
Okay.

143
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,320
My turn.

144
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:37,920
So cute!

145
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:39,640
"Cute" my ass.

146
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:42,440
Now move over there.

147
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,880
Where? / Don't take it off yet.

148
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:47,480
Keep it on and...

149
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:50,080
Go right there.

150
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:57,720
And I wish it lasts forever

151
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:11,399
A songbird's singing

152
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:13,639
Is far less enticing

153
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:18,560
Than your whispering that you miss me

154
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:23,399
Love is a meaningful word

155
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:25,679
But it would not impress anyone

156
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:30,799
I could only say it to you

157
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:36,240
You bring the change of seasons

158
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:42,919
A lonely season is gone

159
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:51,559
A loving season was born

160
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:54,799
With you by my side

161
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:59,800
I start to see the color

162
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:03,920
Of love and passion

163
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:09,560
And I wish it lasts forever

164
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:19,320
Hem,

165
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,240
Have you seen my sketchbook?

166
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,080
No.

167
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,200
What's the matter?

168
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,080
Nothing.

169
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,960
I'll record some more footage.

170
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:40,840
Okay.

171
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,560
Hold onto it for me if you see it, okay?

172
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:44,720
Okay.

173
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,200
You haven't seen it, right? / No.

174
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:02,040
Are you sure?

175
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,080
I am.

176
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:39,600
THE KING OF POKPA.
HARD TO FATHOM YET IS WARM TO THOSE AROUND HIM.

177
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:49,000
FEELIN' SO GOOD!
I WISH I COULD SEE IT GROW.

178
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,680
Are you looking for this?

179
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,400
Yes.

180
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:05,880
Hey, easy. / Hem.

181
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:07,600
Is it that important? / Hem!

182
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:08,680
Whoa.

183
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:12,960
I really need it.

184
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,720
When did you find it? / Just now.

185
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:25,200
Are you sure? / Yeah.

186
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:29,840
It smiles for the camera!

187
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:32,160
It eats again.

188
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:39,920
Here.

189
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:41,480
Thanks.

190
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,720
A little to the left.

191
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:55,800
Whose left?

192
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,880
Is here okay? Hurry up!

193
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,160
Which pose?

194
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,360
This one? / Third?

195
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:33,200
I came to see Mrs. Pat

196
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:37,280
and happened to drive down here to see the elephants.

197
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:51,160
We have each other

198
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:55,920
I will never leave your side

199
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:01,880
Your heart and mine

200
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:08,400
Nothing can come between us

201
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,760
Why are you here?

202
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:57,320
Why must I leave?

203
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:22,000
And why...

204
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:25,160
do you want to leave?

205
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,600
I hate this place.

206
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,280
Is there really nothing...

207
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,200
that makes you love this place?

208
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:36,280
What's wrong?

209
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,320
You've been acting weird lately.

210
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:43,480
I'm fine. I'm just working on my thesis.

211
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,000
Hey,

212
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,480
what's wrong?

213
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:50,000
You're avoiding me.

214
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:52,880
And you pout like a girl.

215
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:55,000
That's not funny.

216
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:59,160
And look who's talking. You also do it.

217
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:52,760
What!

218
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:54,400
A burden has been lifted, right?

219
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:56,240
It's been sent!

220
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:02,080
I know it will be great.

221
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,400
Hello.

222
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:20,560
Are you nervous?

223
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:22,640
A little.

224
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:27,240
Uncle Hem told me that you chose Pokpa as your inspiration.

225
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:30,640
I would love to see it. / Great!

226
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:32,680
You will.

227
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:35,080
Okay. / I just saw you at the market.

228
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:36,760
I came straight here.

229
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:38,200
Let's celebrate after this.

230
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:40,600
Thank you.

231
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:44,480
All set. / Mine too.

232
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:54,120
Scoot in. / Okay.

233
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,600
Hello everybody. / Hi.

234
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:58,800
Hi. / Hey.

235
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,880
Hurry up. It's starting soon.

236
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:09,040
Here it goes.

237
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:08,240
Thank you

238
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:11,320
for including me in your work.

239
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:31,880
I'm over her.

240
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:45,720
Why are you telling me this?

241
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:49,360
Just wanted to.

242
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:53,600
It's why I'm here.

243
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:23,280
Hem,

244
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:28,840
the Moon is beautiful, isn't it?

245
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:43,920
A loving season was born

246
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:47,440
With you by my side

247
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:52,600
I start to see the color

248
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:56,479
Of love and passion

249
00:29:56,480 --> 00:30:02,960
And I wish it lasts forever

250
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:46,760
Hello, Grandma.

251
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:51,960
I got the scholarship.

252
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:01,000
Your work is really impressive.

253
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:04,960
For what it's worth,

254
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:06,760
it makes me realize...

255
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:11,720
that you love this place.

256
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:19,600
I'm sorry

257
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:22,360
to disappoint you.

258
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:30,280
Do you still want to leave this place?

259
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:46,400
Did Hem know about this?

260
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:28,840
I know about it.

261
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:15,200
Do you think...

262
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:24,480
that I will be as happy as I imagine?

263
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:26,640
Hey,

264
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:28,640
it's too late to worry.

265
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:39,240
I know it's my dream,

266
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:46,400
but I can't be certain

267
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:49,240
if it will turn into a nightmare.

268
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:52,760
Come on.

269
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:56,600
I'll be happy for you if things are going well.

270
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:59,160
If things go bad,

271
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:02,640
I'll still be right here.

272
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:07,600
You should follow your dream.

273
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:09,880
Make it happen.

274
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:13,640
When it does,

275
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:16,440
I'll be very happy to see that.

276
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:32,080
Come on.

277
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:40,840
Don't cry.

278
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:43,480
You made it, right?

279
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:08,280
Let's stay up all night.

280
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:20,280
Cheers! / Yeah!

281
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,520
Bottoms up.

282
00:36:56,320 --> 00:37:00,280
You're getting good at this. Have some more.

283
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,280
Where are you going?

284
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:44,200
Here.

285
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:45,400
My condo room key.

286
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,440
Are you serious?

287
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:56,040
Take a good care of it.

288
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:00,720
I will.

289
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:18,600
I closer I get to you

290
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:24,240
The wilder my heart grows

291
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:34,040
Once your eyes meet mine

292
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:38,520
You will know

293
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:57,120
Coming or leaving.

294
00:38:58,200 --> 00:38:59,480
Every action matters.

295
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:14,000
Do you feel it?

296
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:16,880
Hmm.

297
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:18,160
If I were a woman,

298
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:20,640
I would probably go after you.

299
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:29,800
I just notice it

300
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:32,760
when you sit here.

301
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:35,600
The Moon is really beautiful, isn't it?

302
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:45,960
Deep in my heart

303
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:53,040
If you just look into it

304
00:39:53,680 --> 00:40:00,120
You will see what lies inside

305
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:08,680
I'm quite good at many things.

306
00:46:10,120 --> 00:46:11,360
But I suck...

307
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:16,520
at saying goodbye to people I cherish.

308
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:25,920
I never expect to get attached to this place

309
00:46:29,840 --> 00:46:30,960
or its people.

310
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:51,560
Did you know how I feel

311
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:54,480
About you

312
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:59,600
I have been keeping it a secret

313
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:05,000
So you would not know

314
00:47:14,440 --> 00:47:16,920
The closer I get to you

315
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:21,680
The wilder my heart grows

316
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:28,719
Once your eyes meet mine

317
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:32,520
You will know

318
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:33,880
Just don't disappear again.

319
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:40,079
Deep in my heart

320
00:47:40,080 --> 00:47:45,760
If you just look into it

321
00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:52,640
You will see what lies inside

322
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:56,119
If I were a woman, I would go after you as well.

323
00:47:56,120 --> 00:47:58,680
Deep in my heart

324
00:47:59,120 --> 00:48:04,640
If you just look into it...

325
00:48:06,080 --> 00:48:07,480
The Moon is beautiful, isn't it?

326
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:11,360
You will see what lies inside

327
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:17,720
That is my love waiting for you

328
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:27,320
It shouldn't be like this.

329
00:48:30,680 --> 00:48:32,760
I shouldn't get attached to a place

330
00:48:33,320 --> 00:48:36,680
where I want to get away from.

331
00:48:39,560 --> 00:48:40,520
But now...

332
00:48:41,480 --> 00:48:42,920
I love this place

333
00:48:45,120 --> 00:48:46,280
so much...

334
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:51,520
that I could throw away my dream for it.

335
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:56,120
Let's say...

336
00:48:57,400 --> 00:48:59,760
I will say goodbye to them when I'm ready.

337
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:11,960
I took your room key

338
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:14,840
and I left my rabbit head there.

339
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:18,960
In case that

340
00:49:20,440 --> 00:49:21,760
you miss me as well.

341
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:40,640
Deep in my heart

342
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:46,640
If you just look into it

343
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:53,720
You will see what lies inside

344
00:49:54,720 --> 00:50:01,240
That I want to say I love you

345
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:11,120
MISS ME ALREADY?

346
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:19,400
A plot from the novel "Lost in the woods" by theneoclassic
