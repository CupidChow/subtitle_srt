All set.

00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,720

Honey, are you ready?

00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:59,840
Uh. Give me a moment, Mom. I'm coming down.

- Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

- Pass me the dumplings.
- Get it yourself, man!

36
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:33,840
Come, let's celebrate.

37
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,240
Cheers!

38
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:50,040
Today is my beloved son's graduation.

39
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:55,280
He has prepared a special show for us.

40
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:01,440
Let's hear it for Fifa!

41
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,200
That's my son.

42
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,200
Bravo!

43
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:53,880
Thank you for being here
to celebrate my graduation.

44
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:57,720
I have an important announcement to make.

45
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:03,560
I applied for a scholarship

46
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:07,480
to study art and design in Japan.

47
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:09,240
That's Japan!

48
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,040
I'm going to Japan, guys.

49
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,240
I will see you there.

50
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,280
I won't allow it!

51
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,280
Fifa,

52
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,880
a word?

53
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,600
You should go talk to her.

54
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,320
Never!

55
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:55,200
I won't go to Pokpa, ever!

56
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:07,520
- We always let you do as you want.
- Right!

57
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,640
This time,

58
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:14,960
- you will listen to us.
- Right!

59
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:24,240
I know well.

60
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:27,880
Grandma…

61
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:32,000
owns everything we have

62
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,680
including Pokpa.

63
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:36,720
But my life…

64
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,880
is my own.

65
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:43,680
Grandma…

66
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:47,600
has no right to tell
me how to live my life.

67
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,640
Actually,

68
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,840
Dad is the one who should go there.

69
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:58,280
I never want to inherit anything from her

70
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:00,040
like you do.

71
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,000
Fifa!

72
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,320
Fine.

73
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:15,600
I will go talk to her.

74
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30,280
Well,

75
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,240
that scholarship,

76
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:34,080
tell me about it.

77
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:45,400
I've applied for Creative Art major

78
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:49,120
at Kyoto University of
The Art and Craft Design.

79
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,960
It's a prestigious university...

80
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:59,640
What kind of scholarship?

81
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,840
Full ride? Partial?

82
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:06,680
Does it cover all of your living expenses?

83
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,120
It's full-ride.

84
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:11,880
It is an academic excellence scholarship.

85
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:15,640
It covers everything,
from tuition fees to housing.

86
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:20,600
I just need my personal expenses.

87
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:21,920
No big deal, Grandma.

88
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,160
Up to this very moment,

89
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:29,240
I have been paying for
all your living expenses.

90
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,360
You do realize that, right?

91
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:36,480
I do.

92
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,760
You must work at Pokpa for six months.

93
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:48,760
Six months?

94
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:51,440
I can't waste half a year there!

95
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:53,360
Are you going to force me

96
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,600
to give up my life and
do things I don't love?

97
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:58,440
I have to take care of my
application and interview.

98
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:00,920
That alone takes three months!

99
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,480
Then I'm leaving for Japan.

100
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:04,880
Sure.

101
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,640
Have it your way.

102
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:15,720
But I'm taking back everything I gave you.

103
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,800
- This house as well.
- What!

104
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:23,160
I told you my conditions.
Take it or leave it.

105
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,040
Wait, Grandma.

106
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:34,560
Okay.

107
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:38,280
Let's meet halfway. Three months.

108
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,280
Three months at Pokpa
then I leave for Japan.

109
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,400
I'll prove it to you

110
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:50,160
that Pokpa is not for me.

111
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:54,120
Three months it is.

112
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:58,280
You have one day to
rest. We'll meet in two days.

113
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:06,040
<i>Shit! It's a lot faster than I expect.</i>

114
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,880
<i>That's only so much time to prepare.</i>

115
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:10,360
<i>Well, it sure sucks to be me.</i>

116
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,160
Damn it!

117
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,960
<i>You must work at Pokpa for six months.</i>

118
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:26,640
<i>- Three months at Pokpa…
- We always let you do as you want.</i>

119
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:29,040
<i>Work at Pokpa for six months.</i>

120
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:32,360
<i>This time, you will listen to us. / Right!</i>

121
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,680
<i>I got this. Just three months.</i>

122
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:40,720
<i>Three months that will change my life.</i>

123
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:56,600
<i>But that's my 129,600 minutes!</i>

124
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,320
You know,

125
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:22,880
I gave my all to get this scholarship.

126
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:27,160
I practiced drawing.

127
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,080
Learned Japanese.

128
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:37,480
I studied hard to get good grades.

129
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,000
I'm sorry for what I did.

130
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:03,920
It's all right.

131
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:11,560
I'm sorry.

132
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,600
I gave you a headache.

133
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:16,600
We're going to miss you so much.

134
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:19,120
Don't say that. I'm going to cry.

135
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,560
Good afternoon everyone.

136
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:35,360
Welcome to Pokpa Nature Park.

137
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,320
For the elephants here, Pokpa is their home

138
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:04,520
because we live as a family.

139
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:12,960
In natural habitats,
elephants live as a herd

140
00:13:13,512 --> 00:13:15,872
so we don't change them.

141
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:20,080
We let them live freely,

142
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,680
as you can see.

143
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,600
Please excuse me.

144
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,120
Hello, ma'am.

145
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:01,800
I didn't expect to see you here.

146
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,800
Fasai is eating well.

147
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:08,040
Last time I was here, she
wouldn't even join the herd.

148
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,400
Where is Hem anyway?

149
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,240
Did you see him, Prod?

150
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:15,200
Tell him I'm looking for him

151
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:17,120
and send him to my office, will you?

152
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,600
Okay. I will tell him.

153
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:36,440
<i>Calling Pokpa 07.</i>

154
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,720
<i>Hem, answer me.</i>

155
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:44,560
<i>I know you can hear me.</i>

156
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:48,240
<i>Move your ass here right now. It's…</i>

157
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,160
Hem!

158
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:21,320
Hem! Did a tiger already get
you? Or did you die in a fire?

159
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,600
Lost in the woods, maybe?

160
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:32,240
We are talking about Hem.

161
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:35,760
He can even make his way
back with his eyes closed.

162
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:38,440
He comes and goes as he pleases.

163
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,560
I'd love to get lost with him in the woods.

164
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,320
Huh!

165
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:26,480
<i>Emergency. A wildfire on the right side.</i>

166
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,240
This is Pokpa 07. Copy that.

167
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:38,920
<i>We've got a 201 on the right side.</i>

168
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:46,640
Hurry up!

169
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:58,160
- How's the situation, Diaw?
- It keeps spreading.

170
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:01,840
- We need help on this side to contain it.
- Roger.

171
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:06,440
This is Pokpa 07. We've
got a 201 on the right side.

172
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:08,120
Request backup immediately.

173
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:25,120
Move this way.

174
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,280
"Why do you want to study

175
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:56,240
at Kyoto University of
the Art and Craft Design?"

176
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:08,200
Fifa! Did you find it?

177
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:10,480
- Come up here and help me look.
- I found it.

178
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,440
Can't even have alone time.

179
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:24,960
- So what's happening?
- Three months at Pokpa.

180
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:29,440
- Three months?
- Get me watercolor.

181
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:33,200
Will you be okay?

182
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:36,360
Why won't I? It's only three months.

183
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:37,640
Piece of cake.

184
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:39,560
Piece of cake?

185
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:43,280
- Nepal.
- What?

186
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:46,880
- Help me pack.
- What should I pack?

187
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,160
Overpacking alert!

188
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:55,120
That white bag. On the right.

189
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,440
- My right?
- See it?

190
00:18:56,800 --> 00:19:00,600
- Should I bring this?
- Sure. Might be cold there.

191
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:04,360
My guitar.

192
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:07,320
And these rocks?

193
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,600
A wildfire started sooner this year,

194
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:32,440
It spread more into our area.

195
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:35,920
Act swiftly but carefully.

196
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:40,120
Do what must be done.

197
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:47,960
I have a favor to ask.

198
00:19:56,600 --> 00:20:00,040
My grandson, Fifa, is coming
to help with the work here.

199
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:04,280
I want you to train and look
after him while he is here.

200
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,600
Can you do that?

201
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:27,360
It's too much. That's a selfish request.

202
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:31,400
Top me up.

203
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:39,920
I don't get her.

204
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:42,880
How much more do I have to do?

205
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:46,960
If you want to talk, I'm all ears.

206
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:49,680
It's Mrs. Pat.

207
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:52,920
She knew that I came here…

208
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,000
that I fled to Pokpa…

209
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:00,520
because I wanted solitude.

210
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,920
To be alone.

211
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:07,440
To live a quiet life.

212
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:09,920
Prod…

213
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:12,760
Listen to it.

214
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,640
Don't use your ears.

215
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:22,000
Use your heart.

216
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:28,720
All I need is nature

217
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:31,560
and Pokpa.

218
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:37,640
You are totally drunk.

219
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,360
Let's call it a day.

220
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:42,880
I don't get her.

221
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:45,520
I'm not happy with this.

222
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:48,840
What was she thinking?

223
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:53,840
He's her grandson. She should
be the one looking after him.

224
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:01,600
Well,

225
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:06,520
she knows that you are…

226
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:09,240
gentle with animals

227
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:12,840
so she assumes you are good with kids?

228
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,040
Prod.

229
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:19,160
Can you do it instead?

230
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:21,760
Please?

231
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:24,480
No. It's your duty.

232
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:27,240
Mrs. Pat has her reasons.

233
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:30,880
See? You don't get it either.

234
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,400
<i>I won't ever take it off.</i>

235
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:59,000
<i>You promise?</i>

236
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:48,640
<i>Come on, Fifa. You have
to do it. Just three months.</i>

237
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:52,880
Well, your grandmother
sent this car to pick you up.

238
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,840
Just hang in there. It won't be long.

239
00:23:57,040 --> 00:24:00,960
He will drop you off in front of Pokpa.

240
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:04,720
Uncle Hem will pick you up from there.

241
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,560
Take care of yourself, honey.

242
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,840
- Dad. Mom.
- Yes?

243
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:14,720
If you can take a day off,

244
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:17,480
come to visit me, okay?

245
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:22,080
- I'll see you soon, okay?
- Well…

246
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,080
Well…

247
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:26,960
Well. Your grandmother forbids us

248
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:30,480
from visiting you during
these three months.

249
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:34,640
But, surely, she will
take a good care of you.

250
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:40,840
Am I going to Pokpa or a prison?

251
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:45,120
- You can do it.
- Okay.

252
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:48,320
I can do it. See you soon.

253
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,440
Your ride, sir.

254
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:57,720
Don't forget to submit your
essay and all documents.

255
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:59,200
- Okay.
- Today's the last day.

256
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:01,640
- Good luck. Bye.
- Bye.

257
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:09,920
Oh, honey.

258
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:25,640
<i>Getting myself into a risky situation</i>

259
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:31,720
<i>I become too careless. You
make my heart skip a beat</i>

260
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:39,960
<i>I am lost in the woods. But
I am in no hurry to get out…</i>

261
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:44,960
<i>Pretending to be afraid, shaking in fear</i>

262
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:48,120
<i>But I actually love this</i>

263
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:54,240
<i>I am lost</i>

264
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:57,560
<i>Anybody can see, this
tell-tale heart of mine</i>

265
00:25:57,640 --> 00:26:02,120
<i>I am lost</i>

266
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:05,320
<i>And blushing. My heart does not lie</i>

267
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:13,280
<i>Exploring his heart</i>

268
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:20,680
<i>Looking around and calling dibs on him</i>

269
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:28,640
<i>I am lost in the woods. But
I am in no hurry to get out…</i>

270
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:32,920
<i>Pretending to be afraid, shaking in fear</i>

271
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,280
<i>But I actually love this</i>

272
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:37,440
Whoa!

273
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,600
Sorry. There's a snake.

274
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:43,440
It's okay.

275
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:56,000
Wait! Hold on!

276
00:26:58,320 --> 00:26:59,400
Shit.

277
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:05,800
Damn it!

278
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:23,960
I'll sit in the back, okay?

279
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:36,160
All set!

280
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:50,800
"The contemporary chaos
of our ever-evolving world.

281
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:54,600
I believe that a person can
express himself in many ways.

282
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:56,880
And I want my illustrations that I designed

283
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:00,600
to reflect myself through
many different types of art,

284
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:03,600
so I have big dreams to be an
artist who runs the world of art."

285
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:05,120
Nice.

286
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:07,240
Let's do it.

287
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:14,680
Huh?

288
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:17,080
What!

289
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:19,200
No signal?

290
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:23,200
Huh?

291
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:34,400
No!

292
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:07,680
- Thank you so much.
- You're welcome.

293
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:21,600
Where do we go next, Uncle Hem?

294
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:25,520
Uncle? Not too fast. Just call me Prod.

295
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:28,520
Hem is busy right now.

296
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:33,240
He asked me to come in his place.

297
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:35,760
My name is Fifa.

298
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,080
- Fifa?
- Yes.

299
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:42,680
This? You know, rock star stuff.

300
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:46,040
- Rock star?
- Yeah.

301
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:49,320
- Come on. I'll drop you off.
- Okay.

302
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:59,440
- All set?
- Yes.

303
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:19,160
Fifa.

304
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:23,760
My 129,600-minute countdown starts now.

305
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:27,120
<i>In the woods...</i>

306
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,520
<i>On a dirt road...</i>

307
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:31,240
<i>No one here knows what a rockstar is.</i>

308
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:35,800
<i>Stay strong, Fifa. Don't lose heart.</i>

309
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:39,840
<i>I will get away from here as soon as I can.</i>

310
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:43,160
You are familiar with planting trees.

311
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:48,640
But do you know how to plant
a tree to also benefit the soil?

312
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,320
- No, we don't.
- No idea.

313
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,920
It's called "Three Forests, Four Benefits".

314
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:58,760
You can do this at home.

315
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:03,320
These trees will benefit you in many ways.

316
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:07,560
Some provide shade and some food.

317
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:11,400
They also have positive
effects on water and soil

318
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:14,240
and improve soil infiltration.

319
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:18,960
Thank you.

320
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:24,480
We have severe drought this year.

321
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:27,040
Wildfire starts sooner than expected.

322
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:31,640
I want your help with tree planting.

323
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:37,760
It won't help you today but
it definitely will in the future.

324
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:51,560
<i>It's the gecko house! I remember it!</i>

325
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:59,040
This tree house has
electricity from solar panels.

326
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:01,160
The view is amazing.

327
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:03,520
Nice riverside house.

328
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:08,680
Love it.

329
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:11,440
<i>Get me out of here!</i>

330
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:15,320
Put up the mosquito net
around four or five PM, okay?

331
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:18,200
There are tons of mosquitoes.

332
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:24,120
I'm sure you will figure it out. Take care.

333
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:27,160
Take this.

334
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:30,600
Know how to use it?

335
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:34,000
It's fine.

336
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:37,160
I can use my cellphone.
Give me your number.

337
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:42,440
You'd better take this. The
service is poor around here.

338
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:46,880
You probably get signal if you're lucky.

339
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:49,560
We all use walkie-talkies

340
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:52,520
or we just drive to each other's place.

341
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:54,480
Got it, rock star?

342
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:57,800
See you.

343
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,000
<i>Shit!</i>

344
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:03,440
<i>A world without cell phones?</i>

345
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:06,160
<i>No reception?</i>

346
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:11,600
<i>How could a rockstar survive this place?</i>

347
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:19,360
Wait!

348
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,400
(FREE SAPLINGS)

349
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:30,280
I need your help to finish
a weir before rainy season.

350
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:34,080
Hem, I surveyed the spot
where we're going to build a weir.

351
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:36,520
- Good.
- I think we can begin tomorrow.

352
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:38,960
Okay.

353
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:42,120
Everyone,

354
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:44,880
feel free to take these saplings home.

355
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:47,800
Please take one.

356
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:50,360
One each, please.

357
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:58,960
Kaew, take two for both of us.

358
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:01,320
How long will it take?

359
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:04,280
I guess it will take two days.

360
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:42,640
<i>Right! Last day to submit my essay.</i>

361
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:46,480
<i>And I haven't submitted it yet!</i>

362
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:50,080
<i>Where the heck is my phone?</i>

363
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:03,880
<i>I knew it.</i>

364
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:06,440
<i>No reception.</i>

365
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:55,360
Damn it!

366
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:40,240
No?

367
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:48,120
Ouch!

368
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:55,240
Yes!

369
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,800
This is it. Yes!

370
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:33,840
Almost there.

371
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:35,120
Come on.

372
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:43,240
Yes!

373
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:48,520
Phew.

374
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:53,480
Hold on.

375
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:55,600
Where…

376
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:01,080
Where the hell is this?

377
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:19,680
Shit!

378
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,960
Shit, who are you? Put me down!

379
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:39,000
- What?
- Put me down now! Now!

380
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:41,280
Are you a thief?

381
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:43,760
- Someone from Pokpa?
- You bet!

382
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:47,200
What are you doing out here this late?

383
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:49,120
Damn it!

384
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:54,280
I was looking for signal
and was lost before I knew it.

385
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:58,240
You went this deep in the
woods for phone signal?

386
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:00,920
Cellphone in the woods? Really?

387
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:06,280
Well, I need it! I wouldn't
come here just for fun.

388
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:08,440
- I'm off.
- Wait!

389
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:13,200
Please take me out of here.

390
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:17,920
It is my first day here. My
place is right behind Pokpa.

391
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:22,560
It's so dark here. I don't know the way.

392
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:25,080
Please help me.

393
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:28,120
Please.

394
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:33,560
Fifa?

395
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:42,880
Huh?

396
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:47,800
Oh, you must be Uncle Hem!

397
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:50,720
Thank goodness!

398
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:53,120
Thank you so much.

399
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:57,480
This place really creeps me out.

400
00:39:58,160 --> 00:39:59,800
There are geckos everywhere!

401
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:03,040
I just found one right next to
my face. I was scared shitless!

402
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:08,520
If there are geckos at my place,
help me get rid of them all, okay?

403
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:11,360
Let's go.

404
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:14,320
I'm here to train you, not to babysit you.

405
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:18,480
If you can't take it, just go
home. No one asks you to be here.

406
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:22,640
Hey! You don't have to be harsh...

407
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:25,160
Run back home if you can't take it!

408
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:32,200
Wait for me!

409
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:38,640
<i>It might seem impossible
for a lost bunny like me</i>

410
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:42,880
<i>to survive 129,600 minutes in Pokpa.</i>

411
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:47,440
<i>If I were to make it out of here,</i>

412
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:50,280
<i>I would need the help from
a ferocious lion like him.</i>

413
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:51,600
Get out of here!

414
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:55,320
You don't belong here.

415
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:57,320
- I...
- Go!
