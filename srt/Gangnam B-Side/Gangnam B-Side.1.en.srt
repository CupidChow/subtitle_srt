00:00:14,222 --> 00:00:18,226
GANGNAM, SEOUL

2
00:00:24,149 --> 00:00:27,235
Let's wait for Jangho, at least.
The four of us won't be enough.

3
00:00:27,318 --> 00:00:28,903
He'd never put us before his wife,

4
00:00:28,987 --> 00:00:31,531
especially since today
is her mom's birthday.

5
00:00:31,614 --> 00:00:32,991
He's one lucky man.

6
00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:36,494
He always weasels his way
out of the tough busts, you know?

7
00:00:39,497 --> 00:00:41,082
What the…

8
00:00:41,666 --> 00:00:42,667
Hey, Kang Dongwoo!

9
00:00:45,003 --> 00:00:47,797
You can't just force this on us
without prior authorization.

10
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:48,882
So what if I did?

11
00:00:48,965 --> 00:00:50,759
It's all on you if this goes to shit.

12
00:00:50,842 --> 00:00:54,304
My God. Quit whining already
and cover my six, all right?

13
00:00:54,387 --> 00:00:57,557
If this goes well, you'll get some credit.
We good?

14
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:05,231
- Hey, kid. Wrap this up and come in.
- Yes, sir.

15
00:01:35,804 --> 00:01:36,679
Now.

16
00:01:38,348 --> 00:01:40,475
What the fuck
happened to the music?

17
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:43,686
Okay. Lights.

18
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:44,896
Go again now.

19
00:01:46,022 --> 00:01:47,649
Hey!

20
00:01:47,732 --> 00:01:50,693
Attention everyone! This is the police.

21
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:54,114
You're all under arrest
for violating the Narcotics Control Act.

22
00:01:54,197 --> 00:01:56,449
Put your hands on your heads,
and get down.

23
00:01:56,533 --> 00:01:58,993
Boys and girls, party's over.
Time to go home!

24
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:11,005
Hey, somebody tell that girl
to put some clothes on.

25
00:02:17,178 --> 00:02:21,432
Hey, if it isn't
our star detective, Captain Kang Dongwoo.

26
00:02:24,602 --> 00:02:28,356
You just got me a big score.
Let's wrap it up and get out of here.

27
00:02:28,857 --> 00:02:30,692
-Dinner, my treat.
-Yeah, in a minute.

28
00:02:30,775 --> 00:02:32,152
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

29
00:02:32,235 --> 00:02:34,320
Come on. I said, let's call it a day.

30
00:02:34,404 --> 00:02:37,699
Look, you did a fantastic job.
We're all good.

31
00:02:42,745 --> 00:02:46,749
It better be a fancy dinner, man.
I'm not a cheap date.

32
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:49,127
-I'ma buy you a steak. Wagyu?
-Okay.

33
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:50,378
-You down?
-All night long.

34
00:02:50,461 --> 00:02:51,838
- Huh?
- Let's go.

35
00:02:51,921 --> 00:02:53,256
-Let's go.
-All right. Let's go.

36
00:02:53,339 --> 00:02:55,550
-Come on. Let's go.
-Yeah, I'll book a table.

37
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:57,177
-Wait, Dongwoo.
-Come on.

38
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:59,762
-Let go. Let go, you fucking assholes.
-Hey, hey, hey.

39
00:03:04,142 --> 00:03:07,187
You know, the color red
really gets my blood pumping.

40
00:03:09,272 --> 00:03:10,857
Hey, Seo Jisu.

41
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:12,734
Go ahead and call for backup.

42
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:18,615
Shithead.

43
00:03:27,999 --> 00:03:29,000
Hey.

44
00:04:18,174 --> 00:04:19,425
Jangho, man.

45
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:21,427
Give me a fucking break.

46
00:04:24,597 --> 00:04:27,183
Jangho, you bastard.

47
00:04:29,227 --> 00:04:30,478
Please, Dongwoo.

48
00:04:30,561 --> 00:04:33,773
If I go to prison, my wife,
my mother, my daughter…

49
00:04:33,856 --> 00:04:36,317
…they'll be crushed
by the weight of my debt.

50
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:38,820
- Sit down. Sit down.
- Just this once--

51
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:43,491
Jangho,
just accept the consequences, yeah?

52
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:46,953
It's the only way
you'll ever see me again, man.

53
00:04:47,036 --> 00:04:49,998
You think this is all me, Dongwoo?

54
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:53,626
Fuck's sake,
all I did was make a delivery.

55
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:57,714
I swear that was my first time.
You gotta believe me.

56
00:04:57,797 --> 00:05:00,049
What are you implying, you idiot?
It's not just you?

57
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:02,552
Dongwoo, we shouldn't mess with them.

58
00:05:04,012 --> 00:05:06,472
Everyone in Major Crimes is involved.

59
00:05:07,015 --> 00:05:09,600
Are you really gonna
go after all of them?

60
00:05:10,226 --> 00:05:13,479
So please, I beg you, man.
Just let it go.

61
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:21,738
The fuck you think you're doing?
Let me go.

62
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:25,366
You bastard.

63
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:27,327
You're in big fucking trouble now.

64
00:05:28,244 --> 00:05:31,205
Don't worry, buddy.
I'll see you soon.

65
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:40,983
GANGNAM B-SIDE

66
00:06:43,653 --> 00:06:46,656
3 YEARS LATER, GANGNAM

67
00:07:23,234 --> 00:07:24,694
Delivery complete.

68
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:53,973
AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY

69
00:08:44,315 --> 00:08:46,067
Make it look real,
you fucking bitches.

70
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:47,485
Yeah, like that.

71
00:08:47,568 --> 00:08:49,570
You're getting paid,
you better do it right.

72
00:08:49,654 --> 00:08:51,948
- That's fucking right!
- Go down on her!

73
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:54,867
- Hey, Lemon!
- Lemon is here!

74
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:56,869
Enjoy, sir.

75
00:08:56,953 --> 00:08:59,247
Enjoy, yeah, enjoy my dick!

76
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:00,623
- Hold on a sec.
- Yeah, sure.

77
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:03,125
All right, have fun.

78
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:05,836
-Bye, guys.
-Eat this, you fuckers!

79
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:31,320
JJUNI BOY

80
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:38,619
WHERE ARE YOU?

81
00:09:38,703 --> 00:09:40,746
GO GET JENNY RIGHT NOW

82
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:45,251
IF YOU LOSE THAT BITCH,
WE'RE ALL DEAD

83
00:09:45,334 --> 00:09:47,837
Lend me your lipstick.
Those pigs love red.
Lend me your lipstick.
Those pigs love red.

84
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,547
Wonder-- What the hell? Ow!

85
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:51,090
That crazy fucking bitch.

86
00:09:51,173 --> 00:09:53,092
What's the matter with her?

87
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:09,984
What's going on in there?

88
00:10:11,861 --> 00:10:13,529
What is going on?

89
00:10:23,664 --> 00:10:25,708
CALLING JJUNGHWA

90
00:10:27,376 --> 00:10:29,962
You sons of bitches!
What the fuck are you doing?

91
00:10:30,546 --> 00:10:32,089
Get the fuck out of here.

92
00:10:32,173 --> 00:10:34,008
Hey, Jaehee.

93
00:10:34,091 --> 00:10:36,510
Geez, what took you so long to pick up?

94
00:10:36,594 --> 00:10:40,056
I'm so high
I can't feel my tongue or my legs.

95
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:43,601
You're fucked. Lee Junghwa, you…

96
00:10:43,684 --> 00:10:46,604
Something's wrong. What do I do?

97
00:10:46,687 --> 00:10:48,689
Listen.

98
00:10:48,773 --> 00:10:52,151
First shove a finger down your throat,
throw up, then get out of there.

99
00:10:52,234 --> 00:10:54,820
Right now?
But I didn't get paid yet--

100
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:57,657
Get the hell out of there already.
We're all fucked!

101
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,417
Jesus, rude much?

102
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:43,869
Holy fuck.

103
00:11:45,663 --> 00:11:48,207
There she is!
You fucking bitch, get over here!

104
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:52,294
-Get her, damn it!
-Bastards. Holy shit, fuck me.

105
00:12:10,312 --> 00:12:11,480
FILTER - VIDEO

106
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:12,606
NO RESULT

107
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:19,113
Hey.

108
00:12:19,196 --> 00:12:21,198
I think we lost Jenny, that fucking bitch.

109
00:12:21,282 --> 00:12:23,409
I found nothing on Junghwa's phone.

110
00:12:24,076 --> 00:12:26,036
Jenny definitely has it.

111
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:28,664
Track down that bitch, you,
or we're all fucked, got it?

112
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:30,875
Gangnam ain't that big
so you better go find her.

113
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:32,251
I got it, man.

114
00:12:56,066 --> 00:13:00,446
DELETE

115
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:13,751
Fuck.

116
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:25,971
Thank you.

117
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:37,149
What the hell?
What's wrong with you, bitch?

118
00:13:38,692 --> 00:13:41,028
Do you have any idea
how expensive this is?

119
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:43,489
Who's in charge here? Bring him here!

120
00:13:43,572 --> 00:13:44,573
Hey! You the boss?

121
00:13:50,704 --> 00:13:51,997
Excuse me?

122
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:58,379
Hey.

123
00:14:01,757 --> 00:14:05,386
- Hey.
- Stop.

124
00:14:25,823 --> 00:14:26,740
The fuck?

125
00:14:31,328 --> 00:14:34,623
- I mean, why's it so expensive?
- Jesus, prices have gone up.

126
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:36,166
You can't find this stuff anywhere else.

127
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:38,419
Forget it then, just don't buy it.
I don't give a shit.

128
00:14:46,051 --> 00:14:47,678
You fucker.

129
00:14:49,471 --> 00:14:50,723
Come here, come here.

130
00:14:52,141 --> 00:14:56,604
You fucking junkie. Did I not tell you
to never sell drugs to my girls?

131
00:14:56,687 --> 00:14:58,439
It wasn't me.

132
00:14:58,522 --> 00:15:01,317
That fucking bitch, Oh Jinyoung, begged
me to give her some drugs, all right?

133
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,776
Come here, come here.

134
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:04,153
You dumb fuck.

135
00:15:07,364 --> 00:15:12,202
Hey, don't you ever
sell again to my girls.

136
00:15:12,286 --> 00:15:13,662
Got it?

137
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:14,747
Come here.

138
00:15:19,793 --> 00:15:21,879
Hey. Hey, is Jenny here?

139
00:15:21,962 --> 00:15:24,298
She's this bitch who fucked us over
and ran away.

140
00:15:24,381 --> 00:15:26,842
I can go inside and check, right?
Hey, get inside.

141
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:28,969
- Let's get in.
- You guys, go over there.

142
00:15:29,637 --> 00:15:31,221
-Damn it.
-Now where the hell did she go?

143
00:15:33,641 --> 00:15:35,643
-What's going on?
-Yeah, I know. Hold on a sec.

144
00:15:42,107 --> 00:15:44,109
CALLS - GILHO

145
00:15:56,413 --> 00:15:57,539
Damn it.

146
00:16:00,417 --> 00:16:02,878
Shit, man. Why didn't you fucking pick up?

147
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:04,672
Get another girl.

148
00:16:04,755 --> 00:16:06,840
Jinyoung's pretty baked.
She can't work today.

149
00:16:06,924 --> 00:16:10,552
Forget about her right now.
Do you know what happened to Jaehee?

150
00:16:11,136 --> 00:16:11,971
What?

151
00:16:12,054 --> 00:16:15,140
Seems like during her shift last night,
she disappeared. She's gone.

152
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:17,184
Everyone is out there looking for her.

153
00:16:18,686 --> 00:16:22,314
I can't reach Junghwa either.
Did something happen to the girls?

154
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:37,830
MR. YOON

155
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:48,424
She's really not fucking picking up.

156
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:50,009
Could she just be working?

157
00:16:50,092 --> 00:16:51,135
No.

158
00:16:51,218 --> 00:16:52,928
Shit.

159
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:56,557
What's up?

160
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:59,518
Mr. Yoon,
what the hell are you doing?

161
00:16:59,601 --> 00:17:03,272
That bitch is ignoring my calls.
You sure Junghwa didn't run?

162
00:17:04,356 --> 00:17:05,566
Got to go.

163
00:17:17,828 --> 00:17:19,747
We don't know anything.

164
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:22,332
Please… Please don't kill us.

165
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:24,918
I swear we don't know anything.
We really, really don't.

166
00:17:25,836 --> 00:17:28,255
Daddy, no please, Daddy, no--

167
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:33,969
LUCKY ARCADE

168
00:17:38,307 --> 00:17:40,768
The caller
you are trying to reach…

169
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:49,651
WHY WON'T YOU PICK UP?

170
00:17:56,033 --> 00:17:57,284
Junghwa?

171
00:18:31,985 --> 00:18:34,113
Don't you see
that scratch here, old man?

172
00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:37,116
- Come on, that's enough.
- I literally just bought this.

173
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,828
- What you gonna do about it, huh?
- Please calm down.

174
00:18:40,911 --> 00:18:41,995
We're very busy.

175
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:44,456
-Babe, let's just go.
-Just shut up and wait in the car.

176
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:47,501
-The insurance company will be here soon.
-This thing is so fucking loud.

177
00:18:47,584 --> 00:18:49,795
- Is this road for tractors or something?
- Well…

178
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:51,588
Huh?

179
00:18:51,672 --> 00:18:54,216
Tractors are definitely
allowed here, yeah.

180
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:56,301
Why? What?

181
00:18:56,385 --> 00:18:58,428
- Come on. Don't be like this.
- Stop!

182
00:18:59,346 --> 00:19:00,430
Why?

183
00:19:00,514 --> 00:19:02,724
- It's the captain, be cool.
- Oh, fuck.

184
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:04,560
- Thank you, sir.
- Yep.

185
00:19:06,854 --> 00:19:09,565
Captain,
I thought you took the day off.

186
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:12,693
Sir, are you okay? You hurt?

187
00:19:12,776 --> 00:19:14,278
No, don't worry. It's okay, I'm fine.

188
00:19:14,361 --> 00:19:16,822
It was just a minor collision.

189
00:19:16,905 --> 00:19:19,533
The insurance company is arriving.
We can handle this on our own.

190
00:19:19,616 --> 00:19:20,826
So you can go, Captain.

191
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:25,539
You drunk? You look flushed.

192
00:19:25,622 --> 00:19:27,791
That's just the way my face is, man.

193
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:30,252
Can't you tell?

194
00:19:30,335 --> 00:19:32,296
He's the mayor's, uh, second nephew.

195
00:19:32,379 --> 00:19:34,590
Apparently, he drank a bit
while playing golf.

196
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:36,008
We've settled with the old man,

197
00:19:36,091 --> 00:19:38,427
and also, the chief called
and said we should just let him go.

198
00:19:47,811 --> 00:19:51,023
Whoa, pretty dark in there.
I can't see anything at all.

199
00:19:58,405 --> 00:20:02,034
Hey, hey, hey! Fine, fine, fine, fine.

200
00:20:03,452 --> 00:20:05,787
I'll take care of it. Just go, all right?

201
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:09,291
You go and get yourself
a cup of coffee, okay?

202
00:20:11,501 --> 00:20:12,711
What the fuck? Hey, hey!

203
00:20:12,794 --> 00:20:16,173
Do you know who I am, asshole?
You sure you wanna do this right now?

204
00:20:16,924 --> 00:20:18,300
I'm sorry.

205
00:20:18,383 --> 00:20:21,595
The color red
really gets my blood pumping. Hmm?

206
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:26,433
- What the fuck!
- Oh, no. Babe.

207
00:20:26,516 --> 00:20:28,477
Hmm. What could this be?

208
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:31,355
-Huh?
-Hey, we have a situation.

209
00:20:33,523 --> 00:20:35,943
DUI, violation
of the Narcotics Control Act.

210
00:20:36,026 --> 00:20:38,237
Feel free to tell us
who you are at the station.

211
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,239
- Take him.
- Motherfucker!

212
00:20:41,406 --> 00:20:44,284
That's it. You're going down,
you worthless piece of shit.

213
00:20:44,368 --> 00:20:47,955
- Who do you think you are, you dumb fuck?
- Stop it!

214
00:20:48,038 --> 00:20:49,748
You asshole.

215
00:20:49,831 --> 00:20:51,792
You're a dead man, you hear me?

216
00:20:53,585 --> 00:20:55,128
Piece of shit. Bring it on.

217
00:20:55,212 --> 00:20:56,630
What should I do?

218
00:20:58,507 --> 00:21:00,384
That's all you got?

219
00:21:00,467 --> 00:21:02,928
Shit. Damn.

220
00:21:08,892 --> 00:21:10,352
Cuff yourself.

221
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:14,356
Use this for your attorney's fees, okay?

222
00:21:15,399 --> 00:21:16,650
Take him to the police station

223
00:21:16,733 --> 00:21:18,777
if you don't want to
get arrested for bribery too.

224
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:20,279
-Got it?
-Yes, Captain.

225
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:24,116
-Let go of me, you motherfuckers.
-Stop, don't touch me.

226
00:21:24,199 --> 00:21:27,077
Did you have to use excessive force
on the mayor's nephew, seriously?

227
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:30,872
So fucking loud, this punk. Hey!

228
00:21:30,956 --> 00:21:32,791
Quiet down in there.

229
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:35,919
- I know what you look like, asshole.
- Oh, man…

230
00:21:38,046 --> 00:21:39,381
What are we supposed to do?

231
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:42,843
Oh, I see. You lead one big
drug bust in Gangnam,

232
00:21:42,926 --> 00:21:45,470
and now you think
everyone's a dealer, that it?

233
00:21:46,513 --> 00:21:47,639
COMMISSIONER MOON

234
00:21:51,226 --> 00:21:52,477
Salute!

235
00:21:53,729 --> 00:21:55,230
Oh, Commissioner Moon.

236
00:21:55,814 --> 00:21:58,150
Sir, what brings you here?

237
00:22:16,752 --> 00:22:19,921
POCHEON BUKBU POLICE STATION

238
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:22,758
Man… …having served as a cop
in Gangnam

239
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:25,052
for what is it now, two decades?

240
00:22:25,135 --> 00:22:28,180
I assumed you'd be bored out of your mind
out here in the middle of nowhere,

241
00:22:28,263 --> 00:22:29,598
but I guess I was wrong.

242
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:32,517
- I'm just hanging in there.
- Don't play dumb.

243
00:22:32,601 --> 00:22:33,602
GANGNAM MISSING CASES

244
00:22:33,685 --> 00:22:35,771
I'm sure you've heard about it
on the news already.

245
00:22:35,854 --> 00:22:38,482
Both HQ and the Missing Persons Unit
are laying low.

246
00:22:39,566 --> 00:22:43,320
If things go wrong, the police
will be blamed for being incompetent.

247
00:22:43,403 --> 00:22:46,073
So I'm wondering if you
could be the ace up our sleeve.

248
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:50,452
Seriously, Dongwoo, you can't waste
your gift here forever.

249
00:22:51,244 --> 00:22:54,998
I didn't mentor you so you could toil
away in a quiet little town like this.

250
00:22:57,417 --> 00:22:59,211
I already told the chief about it.

251
00:22:59,294 --> 00:23:01,588
I want you back in Gangnam immediately.

252
00:23:01,671 --> 00:23:04,466
Pack your bags. You'll do everything
you can to get through the case

253
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:06,176
faster than the prosecution.

254
00:23:07,135 --> 00:23:08,261
Okay?

255
00:23:10,389 --> 00:23:13,100
Commissioner, I won't do it.

256
00:23:13,767 --> 00:23:15,185
I can't do this.

257
00:23:19,773 --> 00:23:20,774
Why not?

258
00:23:22,109 --> 00:23:24,569
Are you worried a cop
will be involved again?

259
00:23:24,653 --> 00:23:26,905
The bastards you caught,

260
00:23:27,489 --> 00:23:29,908
turns out,
they were moles in the end, Dongwoo.

261
00:23:30,992 --> 00:23:33,161
You've done your penance.

262
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:36,373
They called you a hero, giving you medals

263
00:23:36,456 --> 00:23:39,543
but you were basically
exiled and isolated, weren't you?

264

GANGNAM MISSING CASES

265
00:24:14,953 --> 00:24:16,997
A WOMAN DIES IN HIT-AND-RUN
AT GANGNAM STATION

266
00:24:32,012 --> 00:24:33,180
Hey, I found her.

267
00:24:33,263 --> 00:24:34,723
Hey, you fucking bitch.
Come here.

268
00:24:34,806 --> 00:24:35,807
Come on, get her!

269
00:24:35,891 --> 00:24:37,309
CRAZY BITCH
AT GANGNAM STATION LAST NIGHT

270
00:24:37,392 --> 00:24:39,978
- Get her!
- Wait, no, no, no, stop--

271
00:25:00,248 --> 00:25:01,082
Hello?

272
00:25:01,166 --> 00:25:03,793
Are you the father
of our patient Kang Yeseo?

273
00:25:04,419 --> 00:25:06,213
Yeah. What's the matter?

274
00:25:08,215 --> 00:25:09,799
GANGNAM MAEIL HOSPITAL

275
00:25:09,883 --> 00:25:12,594
What happened?
I heard she was doing a lot better.

276
00:25:12,677 --> 00:25:14,221
Yes, she was.

277
00:25:14,304 --> 00:25:17,682
That's why we reduced her therapy
to biweekly sessions.

278
00:25:17,766 --> 00:25:21,144
However, she's become very anxious lately
for some reason.

279
00:25:24,564 --> 00:25:25,565
Take a look.

280
00:25:27,817 --> 00:25:30,320
Are you still troubled
by what happened back then?

281
00:25:31,363 --> 00:25:33,198
I said I'm not.

282
00:25:33,281 --> 00:25:36,493
It's not your fault, Yeseo.
You can tell me.

283
00:25:38,495 --> 00:25:40,789
Are you still feeling troubled by it?

284
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:50,966
Yeseo! Nurse!

285
00:25:51,716 --> 00:25:53,009
Nurse, we need to escort her out.

286
00:25:53,093 --> 00:25:55,345
- Bring the tranquilizer, come on.
- Let me go!

287
00:25:55,428 --> 00:25:57,639
Calm down, calm down!

288
00:25:58,807 --> 00:26:01,518
I know you and your wife
are both busy,

289
00:26:01,601 --> 00:26:03,645
but you need to watch her more closely.

290
00:26:04,187 --> 00:26:06,356
For someone who has
attempted suicide once,

291
00:26:06,439 --> 00:26:08,775
the second and third attempts
become even easier.

292
00:26:50,984 --> 00:26:52,944
You can't just show up
on whatever day

293
00:26:53,028 --> 00:26:54,696
outside of the visitation schedule.

294
00:26:54,779 --> 00:26:55,780
What about you?

295
00:26:56,615 --> 00:26:58,533
You need to be on TV
while our child is suffering?

296
00:26:58,617 --> 00:27:00,285
Had I known, I wouldn't have.

297
00:27:01,661 --> 00:27:03,955
I came straight from work
as soon as I heard.

298
00:27:08,501 --> 00:27:11,588
What's happening with Yeseo?
It doesn't sound like things are okay.

299
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:15,717
Are you acting like a father
all of a sudden?

300
00:27:16,843 --> 00:27:19,429
I'm her father.
I have the right to know what's going on.

301
00:27:19,512 --> 00:27:21,389
So you're saying you didn't know?

302
00:27:22,474 --> 00:27:25,226
A cop who couldn't solve
a school bullying case.

303
00:27:25,977 --> 00:27:29,773
When our daughter was being blackmailed
by those murderous skanks,

304
00:27:29,856 --> 00:27:32,484
you were too busy obsessing
over those druggies.

305
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:36,321
You're a news anchor.
Why are you repeating such nonsense?

306
00:27:36,404 --> 00:27:39,199
How many times do I have to tell you
it was an acciden--

307
00:27:40,825 --> 00:27:44,287
Pushing a person from the roof
is not an accident, it's murder.

308
00:27:45,372 --> 00:27:48,625
Those girls,
you know they were gaslighting Yeseo.

309
00:27:48,708 --> 00:27:50,210
It was abusive.

310
00:28:35,422 --> 00:28:37,799
IF YOU TAKE THIS OFF AGAIN,
YOU'LL GET ARRESTED!

311
00:28:48,977 --> 00:28:51,312
I CAN BE DISCHARGED TOMORROW.

312
00:28:51,396 --> 00:28:54,107
WILL YOU DRIVE ME HOME? PLEASE?

313
00:29:01,614 --> 00:29:06,494
Why won't you say anything? Seriously,
are you just gonna stay silent?

314
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,246
You fucking…

315
00:29:10,457 --> 00:29:11,458
Hey, are you…

316
00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:17,005
Are you involved with Noh Joonseo
in any way?

317
00:29:18,798 --> 00:29:20,008
I can't do this.

318
00:29:20,091 --> 00:29:21,593
-Hey, Jaehee!
-What?

319
00:29:21,676 --> 00:29:24,095
We're wasting time, we need to go get her!

320
00:29:26,347 --> 00:29:29,809
What if something bad is happening
to Junghwa? What if she's in danger?

321
00:29:34,105 --> 00:29:36,191
Shut your phone off. Just stay put here.

322
00:29:37,692 --> 00:29:40,320
-What are you gonna do?
-I'll bring her here, so just stay put.

323
00:29:40,403 --> 00:29:41,821
Don't make things worse.

324
00:29:44,783 --> 00:29:45,784
Please…

325
00:29:50,663 --> 00:29:52,081
Bring her back.

326
00:30:04,552 --> 00:30:07,305
Before you go,
how about some burgers? Huh?

327
00:30:07,388 --> 00:30:10,016
I mean, you said you wanted
to try that new restaurant.

328
00:30:10,683 --> 00:30:12,060
The one near your building.

329
00:30:12,936 --> 00:30:14,979
That place closed a while ago.

330
00:30:16,022 --> 00:30:19,734
How about that Chinese restaurant
we went to on your graduation day?

331
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:23,154
You know, the one with the dumplings
you like, and they had that sauce…

332
00:30:23,238 --> 00:30:24,823
They had really good sauce, remember?

333
00:30:24,906 --> 00:30:28,326
You mean the entrance ceremony.
You didn't come to my graduation.

334
00:30:40,964 --> 00:30:42,298
-Appa.
-Yeah?

335
00:30:46,094 --> 00:30:50,807
Can you look for my friend, Jaehee?

336
00:30:56,271 --> 00:30:58,356
Jaehee, the girl with the leather jacket?

337
00:30:59,232 --> 00:31:00,859
She's been MIA.

338
00:31:02,485 --> 00:31:04,487
Her phone is turned off,

339
00:31:04,571 --> 00:31:06,781
she's not answering DMs or texts.

340
00:31:07,532 --> 00:31:09,158
I think something's happened to her.

341
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:11,828
You can help me find her, right?

342
00:31:13,288 --> 00:31:16,624
Yeseo,
why do you want to find her?

343
00:31:18,209 --> 00:31:21,129
It's actually not unusual
for kids like her to go missing.

344
00:31:21,212 --> 00:31:22,630
It's not that big of a deal.

345
00:31:22,714 --> 00:31:24,340
I've seen a lot of them, you know?

346
00:31:24,966 --> 00:31:26,301
How can you say that?

347
00:31:26,384 --> 00:31:29,137
Oh, come on. Do you still not
understand who she really was?

348
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:31,431
So Umma told you
that Jaehee is responsible, didn't she?

349
00:31:33,474 --> 00:31:35,184
I hope you don't believe that.

350
00:31:36,185 --> 00:31:38,146
Well, it's not that.
I'm just worried about you--

351
00:31:38,229 --> 00:31:39,355
No, you're not.

352
00:31:39,439 --> 00:31:41,065
I've heard that before from you.

353
00:31:41,816 --> 00:31:44,152
You say you're worried about me,
but you don't really care.

354
00:31:44,235 --> 00:31:45,236
Do you?

355
00:32:04,797 --> 00:32:07,425
You ignored me
the last time I asked you for a favor.

356
00:32:07,508 --> 00:32:10,303
Why do you even want to find her? Huh?
What'll happen if you do?

357
00:32:15,516 --> 00:32:18,186
Yeseo, is there something
you're not telling me about?

358
00:32:23,566 --> 00:32:24,901
It's just…

359
00:32:31,324 --> 00:32:33,326
I can't live in this world without her.

360
00:33:07,026 --> 00:33:08,319
Oh, hey, sorry about that.

361
00:33:08,403 --> 00:33:10,154
-Hey, Appa.
-I'm a little late.

362
00:33:10,238 --> 00:33:12,365
1 YEAR AGO

363
00:33:13,157 --> 00:33:15,034
This is Jaehee, my best friend.

364
00:33:15,952 --> 00:33:18,162
I see. Pleasure.

365
00:33:19,247 --> 00:33:22,000
-I got to go.
-Hey, come on.

366
00:33:22,083 --> 00:33:24,961
Let's just hang out and talk
for a little bit, okay?

367
00:33:25,545 --> 00:33:27,046
-Appa, please.
-Okay.

368
00:33:27,130 --> 00:33:29,132
I'm kind of hungry.
Why don't you get us some food?

369
00:33:29,215 --> 00:33:31,509
Go ahead and get whatever you want. Here.

370
00:33:33,302 --> 00:33:35,346
While you wait, why don't you two talk?

371
00:33:36,973 --> 00:33:37,974
It's all right.

372
00:33:41,352 --> 00:33:42,562
Shall we sit?

373
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:55,074
So you're friends from school?

374
00:33:59,037 --> 00:34:02,248
Hey, gotta tell you.
I really love your leather jacket.

375
00:34:02,331 --> 00:34:03,791
Your parents get you that?

376
00:34:06,544 --> 00:34:08,796
Do I look like I have parents?

377
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,631
Can't you tell by looking at me?

378
00:34:11,382 --> 00:34:12,800
You're a cop or something?

379
00:34:15,094 --> 00:34:17,555
All right. Tell me.
What do you need my help with?

380
00:34:21,851 --> 00:34:25,146
Listen, it's okay. You can tell me.
What trouble did you cause?

381
00:34:26,147 --> 00:34:28,274
Who said I caused it?

382
00:34:28,858 --> 00:34:30,735
Do you need money
so you can settle something?

383
00:34:30,818 --> 00:34:33,279
You're… You're such a dick.

384
00:34:34,822 --> 00:34:35,823
Look.

385
00:34:36,908 --> 00:34:40,328
You don't understand me.
Stop acting like it.

386
00:34:40,411 --> 00:34:42,705
You don't get it, so just stop trying.

387
00:34:44,624 --> 00:34:47,710
I know you don't even care
what happens to someone like me.

388
00:34:51,047 --> 00:34:52,882
Unbelievable.

389
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:58,805
You got so much time on your hands,
you should treat your daughter better.

390
00:35:00,223 --> 00:35:02,683
You think seeing her
every once in a while, buying her…

391
00:35:03,351 --> 00:35:06,187
Getting her stuff like burgers
makes you a good parent?

392
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:11,984
Jaehee, was it?

393
00:35:13,694 --> 00:35:15,530
I know you call yourself her friend,

394
00:35:15,613 --> 00:35:17,990
drag her around to places
and threaten her for money.

395
00:35:18,074 --> 00:35:18,991
Excuse me?

396
00:35:19,075 --> 00:35:20,743
You have any idea what Yeseo
had to go through

397
00:35:20,827 --> 00:35:22,537
because of what happened
on the roof that day?

398
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:24,163
This is bullshit.

399
00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:27,792
Hey.

400
00:35:27,875 --> 00:35:30,294
-If you ever bully Yeseo again, I'll…
-Appa!

401
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:33,631
Hey. This was stupid.

402
00:35:34,298 --> 00:35:36,300
Your old man? Not fucking helpful.

403
00:35:36,384 --> 00:35:37,552
Hey, hey.

404
00:35:39,053 --> 00:35:40,388
Are you completely nuts?

405
00:35:40,471 --> 00:35:42,515
What if we let her go
and something happens to her?

406
00:35:42,598 --> 00:35:43,599
Yeseo.

407
00:35:46,644 --> 00:35:47,645
Yeseo.

408
00:35:53,401 --> 00:35:56,028
GANGNAM SEOBU POLICE STATION,
SEOUL

409
00:35:56,112 --> 00:35:59,282
WITHOUT YOUR HELP,
BULLYING AT SCHOOL WILL CONTINUE

410
00:35:59,365 --> 00:36:00,658
We meet again.

411
00:36:03,703 --> 00:36:06,330
When you ran away, was it out of guilt?

412
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:11,043
I was wondering why you were sent to the
countryside after you were promoted.

413
00:36:11,544 --> 00:36:13,546
Then we found out it was by choice.

414
00:36:13,629 --> 00:36:16,757
Why'd you run away? They were
the ones who were committing the crimes.

415
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:19,385
It wasn't your fault
they ostracized you.

416
00:36:19,468 --> 00:36:22,597
If we could travel back in time
and face the same predicament,

417
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:25,183
Jangho would deserve
to be crushed by you, Captain.

418
00:36:25,766 --> 00:36:30,479
If you hadn't done it, I swear,
I would have ended that punk myself.

419
00:36:31,314 --> 00:36:32,398
Fuck him.

420
00:36:34,233 --> 00:36:35,610
Was it at least therapeutic?

421
00:36:37,445 --> 00:36:39,947
-You know, comforting and all?
-Oh, yeah.

422
00:36:40,531 --> 00:36:43,784
It feels so much safer teaming up
with another loner down here.

423
00:36:43,868 --> 00:36:45,995
What brought you in out of the cold?

424
00:36:46,078 --> 00:36:48,497
KIM JAEHEE

425
00:36:48,581 --> 00:36:52,001
Geez, I thought Yeseo was a nerd,
but she has a pretty scary friend.

426
00:36:52,084 --> 00:36:53,169
LARCENY - ASSAULT

427
00:36:53,252 --> 00:36:56,797
This girl was arrested for committing
larceny in Yeongdeungpo a while back.

428
00:36:57,381 --> 00:36:58,799
That's her only charge.

429
00:36:59,675 --> 00:37:00,760
Hmm.

430
00:37:02,511 --> 00:37:04,055
Oh, here she is.

431
00:37:05,097 --> 00:37:07,433
-Huh. Wait a minute.
-What?

432
00:37:08,309 --> 00:37:11,479
Remember how we arrested those thugs
connected to the dark web some time ago?

433
00:37:11,562 --> 00:37:13,898
-Mm-hmm.
-They were released about half a year ago.

434
00:37:14,690 --> 00:37:16,400
Are those perverts already out?

435
00:37:16,484 --> 00:37:20,363
Yeah, not only that but these bastards
are operating a spy cam business now.

436
00:37:22,281 --> 00:37:23,741
They still haven't learned their lesson.

437
00:37:23,824 --> 00:37:27,828
They set up spy cams in all the clubs,
bars and bathrooms in Gangnam.

438
00:37:28,454 --> 00:37:30,206
I wanted to root out
those stupid bastards,

439
00:37:30,289 --> 00:37:33,709
so I went through all the CCTV
in that area several times.

440
00:37:33,793 --> 00:37:35,461
Oh, here. Look.

441
00:37:35,544 --> 00:37:36,671
GANGNAM CLUB GIRL IN BATHROOM

442
00:37:38,005 --> 00:37:39,298
Same tattoo, right?

443
00:37:42,802 --> 00:37:45,972
She sleeps here like this until some dude
shows up and takes her out.

444
00:37:46,555 --> 00:37:48,349
Seemed odd, so I took a closer look.

445
00:37:49,392 --> 00:37:51,060
Is that it? Any footage from outside?

446
00:37:52,937 --> 00:37:55,940
This was recorded first.
And this is the footage that followed.

447
00:37:57,441 --> 00:37:58,859
Oh, there she is.

448
00:38:00,069 --> 00:38:01,195
In the next clip,

449
00:38:02,488 --> 00:38:04,532
they get into the car in the back.

450
00:38:05,199 --> 00:38:07,076
Wait, there's another girl.

451
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:09,870
I mean,
she kind of looks like her, though.

452
00:38:10,579 --> 00:38:11,956
Doesn't she? Right?

453
00:38:15,334 --> 00:38:16,794
Stop.

454
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:20,214
It's her. She has the same tattoo.

455
00:38:26,971 --> 00:38:27,972
Mmm.

456
00:38:29,098 --> 00:38:30,099
What?

457
00:38:32,268 --> 00:38:34,020
That looks like that bastard from before.

458
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:39,191
3 YEARS AGO

459
00:38:39,275 --> 00:38:41,652
All right, yeah, I know.
Just get in the car first. Come on.

460
00:38:41,736 --> 00:38:44,530
Come here, you fucking junkie.
Hey!

461
00:38:44,613 --> 00:38:47,450
Motherfucker. Hey! Let me fucking go!

462
00:38:47,533 --> 00:38:48,993
What the hell are they doing?

463
00:38:49,076 --> 00:38:50,411
I think he drives call girls,

464
00:38:50,494 --> 00:38:52,747
according to him,
the man robbed his client.

465
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:56,250
If I do drugs or have sex, it's none of
your damn business, fucker-- Ow!

466
00:38:57,126 --> 00:38:58,711
Fuck you.

467
00:39:00,796 --> 00:39:01,964
Fuck!

468
00:39:02,048 --> 00:39:04,633
- Hey, get him!
- You motherfucker!

469
00:39:05,259 --> 00:39:07,261
Hey! You fucking piece of shit!

470
00:39:07,803 --> 00:39:09,638
- Get him up.
- Come here, you fucking junkie!

471
00:39:09,722 --> 00:39:10,723
Get up.

472
00:39:13,309 --> 00:39:16,145
-Where's the woman who was with him?
-Over there. In the back.

473
00:39:17,146 --> 00:39:18,647
Is that your girl?

474
00:39:18,731 --> 00:39:20,232
I'm just a chauffeur.

475
00:39:20,316 --> 00:39:22,401
You're the one who drove her here,
weren't you?

476
00:39:22,485 --> 00:39:24,820
So what? You think chauffeurs
pick their damn clients?

477
00:39:25,738 --> 00:39:28,032
Oh, because cops pick
which criminals to arrest?

478
00:39:28,115 --> 00:39:30,701
- What?
- Let's take him to the station.

479
00:39:30,785 --> 00:39:32,661
-Why bother talking to him?
-Hey, you son of a bitch.

480
00:39:32,745 --> 00:39:35,289
Come here, you fucker.
Come on, you bastard.

481
00:39:36,123 --> 00:39:38,626
- Just get out of here.
- What? We're letting him go?

482
00:39:38,709 --> 00:39:40,961
You're gonna waste our resources
on a chauffeur?

483
00:39:41,045 --> 00:39:44,382
Here. Wipe your face off.
It doesn't look nice.

484
00:39:46,175 --> 00:39:50,179
You motherfucker. You'd better fucking run
if you ever see me, you fucking bitch.

485
00:39:52,348 --> 00:39:53,349
Let him go.

486
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:56,936
Goddamn junkie.

487
00:40:00,439 --> 00:40:03,776
Hey, you'd better not show up
on my radar again.

488
00:40:09,365 --> 00:40:12,993
I wanted to run the license plate,
but we can't run the plate or the ID.

489
00:40:13,661 --> 00:40:15,454
Apparently the prosecution blocked access

490
00:40:15,538 --> 00:40:17,331
because the evidence
is crucial to their case?

491
00:40:17,415 --> 00:40:18,749
Why are they involved?

492
00:40:18,833 --> 00:40:20,084
The new chief prosecutor

493
00:40:20,167 --> 00:40:22,837
assigned the evidence
related to Gangnam Missing Persons Cases,

494
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:24,755
to some random prosecutor.

495
00:40:24,839 --> 00:40:27,383
They even restricted access
on all of the files.

496
00:40:28,801 --> 00:40:30,261
- Okay. Thanks.
- Oh, dear.

497
00:40:30,344 --> 00:40:32,179
Oh, you didn't
have to bring this yourself.

498
00:40:32,263 --> 00:40:33,639
I would've been there to help…

499
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:36,517
Ms. Ryu,
we are free this afternoon, right?

500
00:40:37,601 --> 00:40:40,938
Yes, we don't have anything in particular.
What can I do for you, ma'am?

501
00:40:41,564 --> 00:40:44,108
Please don't disturb me,
and go home on time.

502
00:40:53,576 --> 00:40:58,122
THE 2ND GANGNAM GATE MATERIAL

503
00:41:03,169 --> 00:41:04,920
GANGNAM SERIAL MISSING PERSONS
CASES MATERIAL

504
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:07,131
Hey, man.

505
00:41:08,048 --> 00:41:10,634
You need to give me the money first,
like you promised.

506
00:41:12,094 --> 00:41:14,930
I mean, I'm putting my fucking life
on the line for you.

507
00:41:15,806 --> 00:41:19,518
Whatever. Just hurry
and wire the money to my bank account.

508
00:41:20,811 --> 00:41:21,979
Right now.

509
00:41:24,273 --> 00:41:27,401
For fuck's sake.
This asshole just doesn't get it.

510
00:41:30,029 --> 00:41:31,197
Oh, shit.

511
00:41:36,702 --> 00:41:37,703
What?

512
00:41:38,579 --> 00:41:40,664
-Get out.
-You get in, motherfucker.

513
00:41:45,002 --> 00:41:46,712
Come on out.

514
00:41:47,421 --> 00:41:49,381
Where did you take Junghwa?

515
00:41:50,007 --> 00:41:53,010
I did my thing,
made the delivery, got my money as usual.

516
00:41:53,093 --> 00:41:54,637
- Where?
- All right!

517
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:57,348
All right… …it was
Grand Business Hotel.

518
00:41:57,848 --> 00:42:00,226
Grand Business. There's an event.

519
00:42:00,309 --> 00:42:02,937
-When's the event?
-It's already begun.

520
00:42:03,771 --> 00:42:05,022
You should hurry.

521
00:42:06,774 --> 00:42:07,942
Why are you getting up?

522
00:42:08,025 --> 00:42:10,444
Please stop. Please… …stop!

523
00:42:11,403 --> 00:42:13,489
Please don't--

524
00:42:18,244 --> 00:42:19,495
You motherfucker…

525
00:42:28,671 --> 00:42:29,880
Going in.

526
00:42:35,302 --> 00:42:37,471
Hey, move your ass, would you?

527
00:42:38,639 --> 00:42:39,682
Just go.

528
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:07,793
Hey, there.

529
00:43:07,876 --> 00:43:09,837
It's been a while, Junghwa.

530
00:43:11,046 --> 00:43:13,090
Too long, baby, too long.
