HANGIL CLEANING SERVICE

2
00:01:36,805 --> 00:01:37,806
What the hell?

3
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:39,933
Where'd the body go?

4
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:06,292
- Thank you all.
- Good work today.

5
00:02:06,376 --> 00:02:07,377
Thanks for coming today.

6
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:09,546
-See you next time.
-Thank you. Take care.

7
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:11,881
- Bye. Thanks. Thanks a lot.
- Thank you so much.

8
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:12,966
"Thanks a lot."

9
00:02:13,049 --> 00:02:15,802
Geez. Bullshit. Stupid…

10
00:02:19,848 --> 00:02:20,849
Are you ready, sir?

11
00:02:21,349 --> 00:02:22,392
Yeah.

12
00:02:31,526 --> 00:02:33,361
Ah. Good evening, Mister Noh.

13
00:02:33,444 --> 00:02:34,988
I think we're fucked.

14
00:02:35,071 --> 00:02:36,656
They can't find the body in the house.

15
00:02:36,739 --> 00:02:38,908
Hold on. What do they mean
they can't find it?

16
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:41,703
Someone took Junghwa.
The bitch's body is gone!

17
00:02:41,786 --> 00:02:44,789
Okay. Stop. Listen.

18
00:02:45,415 --> 00:02:48,251
Quit fuckin' around.
Go find Jenny right now.

19
00:02:48,334 --> 00:02:49,544
-Got it?
-Yeah, but she's not, uh--

One, two.

23
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:30,543
It's so good to see you.

24
00:03:30,627 --> 00:03:31,544
Thank you for coming.

25
00:03:32,337 --> 00:03:35,632
Passengers,
please stay clear of the closing doors.

26
00:03:49,687 --> 00:03:52,106
Oh, help! Help! Somebody, please!

GANGNAM B-SIDE

28
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:41,572
This Special Investigations Unit
was formed on the Commissioner's order.

29
00:04:41,656 --> 00:04:43,241
So stay extra alert.

30
00:04:43,324 --> 00:04:45,702
The public's watching us closely
right now.

31
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:47,537
Oh, hey. You're here.

32
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:50,248
I'm sure you all know
Captain Kang Dongwoo.

33
00:04:50,331 --> 00:04:53,084
Given the situation,
he's come all the way out here to help us.

34
00:04:53,167 --> 00:04:54,669
All right.

35
00:04:54,752 --> 00:04:57,630
Don't get cold feet, everyone,
just because we're working a murder case.

36
00:04:57,714 --> 00:04:58,881
We've got a new suspect now.

37
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:01,426
So let's shift the direction
of this investigation

38
00:05:01,509 --> 00:05:03,386
and make use of what we have so far.

39
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:04,387
Okay?

40
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:05,972
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

41
00:05:14,689 --> 00:05:16,566
Hey, Dongwoo. It's been a while.

42
00:05:17,275 --> 00:05:19,777
When are we gonna get the autopsy date
or ID the victim?

43
00:05:21,362 --> 00:05:23,364
Uh…

44
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:27,368
Thanks for your support, but, uh,

45
00:05:28,411 --> 00:05:30,288
regardless of who put you here,

46
00:05:30,371 --> 00:05:32,957
we're not sharing anything
about our investigation with you.

47
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:35,877
Don't get in our way, don't get too nosy.

48
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:39,964
Stay quiet while you're here
and keep quiet when you go.

49
00:05:42,258 --> 00:05:43,384
That would be appreciated.

50
00:05:46,763 --> 00:05:47,889
Let's go eat.

51
00:05:48,389 --> 00:05:49,515
Yes, sir.

52
00:05:50,391 --> 00:05:52,268
- Come on. Let's go.
- Yes, sir.

53
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:01,486
Hey, Jisu.
What's Jangho up to these days?

54
00:06:01,569 --> 00:06:02,779
Send me his number.

55
00:06:04,822 --> 00:06:06,532
- Hello?
- Yeah.

56
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:08,201
Jangho, it's me.

57
00:06:09,744 --> 00:06:10,912
"Me" who?

58
00:06:10,995 --> 00:06:11,829
You know who.

59
00:06:11,913 --> 00:06:13,664
Oh, Mr. Kang Dongwoo?

60
00:06:14,665 --> 00:06:17,710
TOTAL SERVICE

61
00:06:26,511 --> 00:06:29,472
- You busy?
- Look, Dongwoo, you motherfucker.

62
00:06:29,972 --> 00:06:31,182
Stop calling me.

63
00:06:31,265 --> 00:06:33,309
You think I'm still your little servant,
you fuck?

64
00:06:35,353 --> 00:06:36,771
TOTAL SERVICE

65
00:06:40,274 --> 00:06:41,734
Coming.

66
00:06:41,818 --> 00:06:43,152
…ruined my day.

67
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:45,530
Hey, Sungbin, today is such a shitty… Oh!

68
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:48,991
KIM JANGHO, CEO

69
00:06:52,453 --> 00:06:54,539
If I remember, lots of water,

70
00:06:54,622 --> 00:06:55,623
two coffee packets?

71
00:06:55,706 --> 00:06:57,750
You know, I miss your colorful language.

72
00:07:00,962 --> 00:07:02,588
EARN HARD, SPEND FAST
WORK HARD, DIE GRACEFULLY

73
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:03,881
So, how's work?

74
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:07,635
It's good business selling women
and booze in Gangnam, you know?

75
00:07:08,469 --> 00:07:10,596
So you're telling me
you make even more than cops do?

76
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:12,932
My father always wanted a cop son.

77
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:15,643
I guess you could say it was his dream.

78
00:07:15,726 --> 00:07:17,145
Then you took my badge away.

79
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:19,730
You know what I wanted to be?

80
00:07:19,814 --> 00:07:20,898
A gangster.

81
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,528
How many folks you think
get to achieve two dreams in one life?

82
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:28,573
On top of that, I'm a former cop. Shit.

83
00:07:30,658 --> 00:07:33,035
What do you need from me
after three years anyway?

84
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:34,704
I'm looking for a few kids.

85
00:07:35,913 --> 00:07:37,582
Do I look like an investigator?

86
00:07:37,665 --> 00:07:39,667
And why would I help
a piece of a shit like you?

87
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:41,711
Jisu told me everything, you dumbass.

88
00:07:42,211 --> 00:07:43,838
What's this about? Huh?

89
00:07:46,215 --> 00:07:47,800
You beat up some of your customers.

90
00:07:47,884 --> 00:07:49,343
RULING OF ADMINISTRATIVE
APPEALS COMMISSION

91
00:07:49,427 --> 00:07:52,472
I had them put this on hold so you could
cooperate with my investigation.

92
00:07:52,555 --> 00:07:54,265
Look at all your boys there.

93
00:07:54,348 --> 00:07:56,851
You don't want 'em
just sitting on their hands, right?

94
00:07:56,934 --> 00:07:58,478
Christ sakes.

95
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:01,230
Okay fine, what kids you talking about?

96
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:09,489
Well, uh, no. I don't know much either.
Like I told you.

97
00:08:16,412 --> 00:08:17,830
People call him Mr. Yoon.

98
00:08:18,706 --> 00:08:21,334
In this business,
he's a pretty well known pimp.

99
00:08:21,417 --> 00:08:22,627
I've never met him though.

100
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:24,337
I'm telling the truth!

101
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:27,548
You think I'm that stupid,
that I would bullshit Detective Kang?

102
00:08:27,632 --> 00:08:28,674
Come on, man.

103
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:31,719
It's been so long
since he's been in Gangnam.

104
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:34,388
Tell us where this bastard is.

105
00:08:34,472 --> 00:08:35,848
And lose the attitude.

106
00:08:36,432 --> 00:08:39,435
I told you, I'm clueless.
I've got no idea. Okay?

107
00:08:41,103 --> 00:08:42,813
It looks like everyone's looking for him

108
00:08:42,897 --> 00:08:45,107
because of all that shit
about Gangnam and all.

109
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:47,235
With the girl who died at Gangnam Station?

110
00:08:47,318 --> 00:08:49,070
Yeah. So, you know about all that?

111
00:08:49,612 --> 00:08:50,613
Look.

112
00:08:51,322 --> 00:08:53,491
Yoon had two aces up there.
Two great girls.

113
00:08:53,574 --> 00:08:55,493
But then one up and died.

114
00:08:55,576 --> 00:08:56,827
So, what does he do then?

115
00:08:58,454 --> 00:09:00,498
Closes up the whole operation
and just splits town.

116
00:09:00,581 --> 00:09:01,791
And the other girl is?

117
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:04,126
Jenny's her name. I never even met her.

118
00:09:05,628 --> 00:09:06,712
This her?

119
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:11,926
I never met her.
I wouldn't know what her face looked like.

120
00:09:12,009 --> 00:09:14,929
Without money, you never
get to see something like this.

121
00:09:15,596 --> 00:09:16,889
Can we contact them?

122
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:18,391
These other girls working for him?

123
00:09:18,474 --> 00:09:19,684
Are you crazy?

124
00:09:19,767 --> 00:09:22,562
If you do that, he'll flip out
and you're screwed.

125
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:36,534
I sold all my leftover crypto.

126
00:09:37,034 --> 00:09:38,619
It's not much because the market's down.

127
00:09:38,703 --> 00:09:40,496
Thanks, man. I'll pay it all back.

128
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:42,790
What are you gonna do, for real?

129
00:09:42,873 --> 00:09:45,251
All of Gangnam is totally upside down
because of you.

130
00:09:45,751 --> 00:09:47,295
They're all looking everywhere for Jaehee.

131
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:51,299
Can't you just cut a deal
or bargain a little?

132
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:55,177
Give 'em what they want
and find the right time to walk away.

133
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:56,596
Junghwa is dead.

134
00:09:57,513 --> 00:09:59,098
"Walk away"? I can't do that.

135
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:03,686
So, what are you gonna do then?

136
00:10:04,395 --> 00:10:06,105
I'm gonna stay in Gunsan with Jaehee.

137
00:10:06,188 --> 00:10:08,733
-I'll keep an eye out for you.
-No, Jaehee will go.

138
00:10:08,816 --> 00:10:09,984
And you?

139
00:10:10,067 --> 00:10:12,820
They messed with my girls.
I'm gonna find those bastards.

140
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:15,615
Easy. You might end up dead too.

141
00:10:16,991 --> 00:10:18,159
I'm not gonna die.

142
00:10:18,909 --> 00:10:19,744
I owe you money.

143
00:10:20,536 --> 00:10:22,121
You crazy bastard. Shit.

144
00:10:22,705 --> 00:10:24,457
Lay low. I'll keep you posted.

145
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:29,545
- You've been assigned a passenger.
- Fuck me.

146
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:37,303
PSYCHE

147
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:58,449
Oh, man. You've got some nerve,

148
00:10:58,532 --> 00:11:01,285
showing up after causing
such a shitstorm in Gangnam.

149
00:11:01,369 --> 00:11:03,204
- Shit.
- Huh?

150
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:07,083
You paranoid bastard.

151
00:11:08,084 --> 00:11:11,504
Hey! You thought it'd be that easy
to see a celebrity up close?

152
00:11:11,587 --> 00:11:13,047
Motherfucker.

153
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:15,800
Something urgent came up
so he wanted me to deliver you a message.

154
00:11:15,883 --> 00:11:18,219
Hey, listen! He wants you to bring Jenny.

155
00:11:18,302 --> 00:11:21,514
He'll pay up, don't worry.
He'll even get you your own bodyguard.

156
00:11:21,597 --> 00:11:24,266
You've been scouted, you bastard.

157
00:11:25,476 --> 00:11:27,186
Oh, wait, wait, wait. Let me finish.
Hold on.

158
00:11:27,269 --> 00:11:29,105
- Ow! Oh, fuck.
- You motherfucker.

159
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:30,981
- Wait. Hold on. You're fucked now.
- Hey.

160
00:11:31,065 --> 00:11:32,525
-Ow, that hurts! Psycho.
-You motherfucker.

161
00:11:32,608 --> 00:11:35,152
The cops know what you look like now,
so you can't run the business anymore.

162
00:11:35,236 --> 00:11:37,697
-You fucking idiot! Son of a bitch!
-What about the cops, you dumb fuck?

163
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:39,281
-I should just--
-Ow, Junghwa!

164
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:41,659
Junghwa! Junghwa's gone! Fuck.

165
00:11:41,742 --> 00:11:44,620
But you should save the rest of the girls.

166
00:11:46,872 --> 00:11:48,207
And Jenny? Is she with you?

167
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:51,836
No? Fuck.

168
00:11:52,503 --> 00:11:55,214
Am I some kind of punching bag for you,
motherfucker, huh?

169
00:11:55,297 --> 00:11:56,549
The fuck?

170
00:11:57,133 --> 00:11:58,843
This is an opportunity.

171
00:11:59,468 --> 00:12:02,388
Just bring Jenny back to him
and he'll give you whatever.

172
00:12:02,471 --> 00:12:03,639
Okay?

173
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:05,057
Name your price.

174
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:06,142
Fuck.

175
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:09,687
So.

176
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:14,358
You serious?

177
00:12:15,609 --> 00:12:17,153
He'll really…

178
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:18,988
…give me anything?

179
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:22,867
Yep. Tell me what you want
and I'll be sure to let 'em know.

180
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:25,161
I'll talk to him myself. Yeah?

181
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:27,455
Arrange it.

182
00:12:27,538 --> 00:12:30,499
Just me and Joonseo, that prick. Got that?

183
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:33,919
Got it.

184
00:12:49,477 --> 00:12:51,604
Oh, shit! You son of a bitch!

185
00:13:00,654 --> 00:13:03,032
Fuck, I'm so pissed.

186
00:13:05,534 --> 00:13:06,535
Goddamn it.

187
00:13:07,036 --> 00:13:08,370
Back already, huh?

188
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:09,497
He receive the message?

189
00:13:09,997 --> 00:13:13,209
Yeah, of course. I explained it
nice and clear so he'd get it.

190
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:15,544
He said he'd bring Jenny.

191
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:19,381
And then all we need to do is get
our hands on what those bitches filmed.

192
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:23,052
And then, when we get everyone together,
it's game over.

193
00:13:23,719 --> 00:13:24,970
Okay.

194
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:27,681
So, tell me, when are you
gonna make the play?

195
00:13:27,765 --> 00:13:29,350
Just relax a little.

196
00:13:29,433 --> 00:13:32,102
You know I get a bit anxious
when something big is going down, right?

197
00:13:32,186 --> 00:13:34,438
Why would you be anxious
over this at all?

198
00:13:34,522 --> 00:13:35,940
Just get it done.

199
00:13:36,023 --> 00:13:38,192
The bosses are doing all
the heavy stuff anyway, no?

200
00:13:41,278 --> 00:13:43,989
This tastes like fucking…

201
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:49,578
- Enough is enough, okay? You little bitch.
- What?

202
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:51,080
Yes?

203
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:53,582
You think, because I'm playing nice,
means we're friends?

204
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:55,334
-Motherfucker.
-Oh, forgive me.

205
00:13:56,168 --> 00:13:58,170
LUCKY ARCADE

206
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:09,557
A WOMAN FOUND DEAD ON PLATFORM
AT GANGNAM STATION

207
00:14:12,893 --> 00:14:15,271
CCTV SHOWS
A MAN ABANDONED THE BODY

208
00:14:16,021 --> 00:14:18,566
Please. Oh, God.

209
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:57,897
GANGNAM STATION
CCTV RECORDING

210
00:15:27,092 --> 00:15:29,970
I've narrowed it down to
a few suspects based on what you sent me.

211
00:15:30,054 --> 00:15:33,223
Someone was filmed at Gangnam Station
two days ago you told me.

212
00:15:33,307 --> 00:15:34,266
Let me have a look.

213
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:40,147
Yoon Gilho. Age 45.
From Damyang, South Jeolla Province.

214
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:42,066
Missing for the past five years.

215
00:15:42,149 --> 00:15:44,360
I believe he obtained a new identity.

216
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:46,695
He's the only unregistered suspect
on the list.

217
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:48,948
His locations on the day
overlap most with the case.

218
00:15:49,031 --> 00:15:51,742
And he was also filmed at the site
where the body was found.

219
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:54,954
Okay, that's all we need. He's our guy.

220
00:15:55,037 --> 00:15:57,122
You don't want to
look into everyone else?

221
00:15:57,206 --> 00:15:59,833
Nope, it adds up with him.
He even has a new identity.

222
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:02,503
All right. Then,
I'll talk with everyone at SIU--

223
00:16:02,586 --> 00:16:04,046
No, we won't work with them on this.

224
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:06,090
Let's make it a joint case
with Major Crimes.

225
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:09,927
-Seoul Police Force?
-Yeah.

226
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:11,470
We've been working with them for a while.

227
00:16:11,553 --> 00:16:14,056
Your job is to make sure
it all fits together neatly,

228
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:15,849
and they will take care of the rest.

229
00:16:29,613 --> 00:16:30,906
SEOUL CENTRAL DISTRICT
PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

230
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:34,535
We only have circumstantial evidence.
Even if we do include evidence from Seoul,

231
00:16:34,618 --> 00:16:37,788
we'll require more direct evidence
if you really want to get an indictment.

232
00:16:40,165 --> 00:16:42,167
Let's just go with Yoon Gilho?

233
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:44,545
It'll be convincing,
since the man's unregistered.

234
00:16:44,628 --> 00:16:49,216
Plus, I assume there's a good reason
why all the top brass want it to be him.

235
00:16:50,092 --> 00:16:51,301
Question, Captain.

236
00:16:51,385 --> 00:16:53,387
Fire away, Prosecutor Min.

237
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:57,933
You're not gonna use any big theatrics,
are you now?

238
00:17:01,812 --> 00:17:02,813
Um…

239
00:17:03,731 --> 00:17:07,609
Don't worry, we'll provide
exactly the right script to indict Gilho.

240
00:17:08,235 --> 00:17:09,778
It'll practically write itself.

241
00:17:11,113 --> 00:17:12,865
You're openly saying script?

242
00:17:12,948 --> 00:17:16,243
Now,
you're not being cooperative, Prosecutor.

243
00:17:17,244 --> 00:17:19,455
Either way,
this is on Prosecutor Tak's order.

244
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:23,208
Meaning whoever he decides to book,
well, that's who we book, yeah?

245
00:17:23,792 --> 00:17:25,878
Wouldn't you agree?

246
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:32,551
Fucker.
Fucker.

247
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:35,637
Come here, you little fuck.

248
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:40,309
You think HYENA is yours? Huh?
Is it yours?

249
00:17:43,187 --> 00:17:45,856
I gave you a position
because of your pretty face,

250
00:17:45,939 --> 00:17:48,067
not to get in fights with everyone.

251
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:51,111
I gave you responsibilities.
And what do you do?

252
00:17:51,195 --> 00:17:52,529
You just party and get high?

253
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:58,410
So, you still
haven't found that bitch yet?

254
00:17:58,494 --> 00:18:00,496
You know that pimp is a real nutcase.

255
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:02,414
You little shit. That's your excuse?

256
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:07,377
Hey.

257
00:18:07,461 --> 00:18:09,379
Can't you see
letting that little bitch get away

258
00:18:09,463 --> 00:18:11,465
is gonna land all of us in the shit?

259
00:18:14,718 --> 00:18:15,719
Joonseo.

260
00:18:17,971 --> 00:18:20,265
Joonseo. Hey, Jjooni.

261
00:18:20,349 --> 00:18:22,059
Ow, my back.

262
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:27,022
Here, come on.

263
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:28,440
Come here.

264
00:18:28,524 --> 00:18:32,778
If things go wrong for me,
they go wrong for you too.

265
00:18:33,987 --> 00:18:35,322
Do you understand?

266
00:18:37,491 --> 00:18:38,492
Yeah.

267
00:18:39,409 --> 00:18:41,245
Goddamn it.

268
00:18:41,745 --> 00:18:43,956
All right, you little bitch, go find her.

269
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:45,332
Now!

270
00:18:53,507 --> 00:18:55,300
Fuck!

271
00:18:58,762 --> 00:19:00,013
I'm gonna get him tonight.

272
00:19:00,097 --> 00:19:02,391
-Really? Tonight?
-We're having a guest,

273
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:05,727
so get some champagne ready.
And candy. Grade A only.

274
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:06,854
And candy?

275
00:19:06,937 --> 00:19:08,230
I mean…

276
00:19:08,313 --> 00:19:09,940
It's a really quick turnaround.

277
00:19:10,023 --> 00:19:12,151
Ah, is that so?

278
00:19:13,944 --> 00:19:15,737
Fine, then. From now on,
I'll just handle it.

279
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:18,615
Hey, come on. Don't get all mad.
I'm just saying.

280
00:19:18,699 --> 00:19:19,700
I can manage it.

281
00:19:19,783 --> 00:19:21,076
Then manage it.

282
00:19:29,084 --> 00:19:30,544
Why'd he do this to my face?

283
00:19:55,777 --> 00:19:57,738
ARE YOU TAKING
GOOD CARE OF THE STUFF? LOL

284
00:19:59,114 --> 00:20:01,241
MIDNIGHT AT YEOKSAM JUNCTION
THE CEO IS COMING, DON'T BE LATE

285
00:20:04,578 --> 00:20:07,539
How's the investigation
with the Captain of Major Crimes?

286
00:20:08,457 --> 00:20:10,292
You've got to finish it in one shot.

287
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:13,045
Too much delay only
makes things complicated.

288
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:16,298
'Cause once it's wrapped up nicely
and submitted,

289
00:20:16,924 --> 00:20:19,968
you'll be on, you know, the fast track.

290
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:21,637
It's what you wanted right?

291
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:25,849
So what you're saying is,
you think you know what I want now.

292
00:20:25,933 --> 00:20:30,479
I do. We're the same,
you and I, ultimately.

293
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:31,939
Cut from the same cloth.

294
00:20:32,022 --> 00:20:34,066
We have our pride, not much else.

295
00:20:34,149 --> 00:20:36,401
And we're so eager
to make it to the top, yeah?

296
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:40,155
At the same time we want to avoid
looking too, uh, eager,

297
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:42,574
so we'll do anything to not seem proud

298
00:20:42,658 --> 00:20:46,620
and we pretend that
we actually have some dignity.

299
00:20:46,703 --> 00:20:48,580
When, really, we're despicable liars.

300
00:20:54,378 --> 00:20:56,296
-Prosecutor Tak.
-Hmm?

301
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:00,133
I'd like to make one thing super clear.

302
00:21:01,468 --> 00:21:03,220
Having no connections at all,

303
00:21:04,554 --> 00:21:06,723
I learned to put up with
all kinds of shit.

304
00:21:06,807 --> 00:21:09,893
But don't ever think of me as disposable.

305
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:12,729
If you want to keep me around,

306
00:21:13,355 --> 00:21:15,691
I will need to be adequately compensated,
you know?

307
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:19,111
For all the extra risk.

308
00:21:21,363 --> 00:21:22,781
Here's the thing.

309
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:27,661
A negotiation is initiated
by the one who has something to offer.

310
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:31,373
You think I came to you
without anything in hand?

311
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:34,418
You know, I became a prosecutor

312
00:21:34,501 --> 00:21:37,129
because I've got a gift
for reading people.

313
00:21:39,923 --> 00:21:42,801
Why don't we get right to the meaty part,
yeah?

314
00:22:10,412 --> 00:22:12,706
Joonseo's back and he's free as a bird!

315
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:21,673
- I like it, I like it.
- There's one over there too.

316
00:22:23,216 --> 00:22:24,593
- Hey, Yun. You're here.
- Salute!

317
00:22:24,676 --> 00:22:25,927
- Hey, Mr. Yun.
- Sir.

318
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:28,972
Ah, good! Thank you for coming, Yun.

319
00:22:29,556 --> 00:22:30,724
Nice.

320
00:22:30,807 --> 00:22:33,685
You're partying on the day
of the prosecutor's examination?

321
00:22:33,769 --> 00:22:36,730
Yeah well, all of this was only possible
thanks to your help.

322
00:22:36,813 --> 00:22:39,524
Stop stirring shit up.
I can't cover for you forever.

323
00:22:39,608 --> 00:22:41,026
Hey, now.

324
00:22:41,109 --> 00:22:43,862
One payment from me
covered your son's tuition in Boston.

325
00:22:46,448 --> 00:22:48,617
-You doing good?
-Yeah, but I missed you.

326
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:50,369
Missed you too, babe.

327
00:22:50,452 --> 00:22:52,579
This is a gift for your son.

328
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:56,041
Okay. What's this about, Joonseo?

329
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:05,258
You know what?

330
00:23:05,342 --> 00:23:08,345
You give a kid something like this
too soon,

331
00:23:09,471 --> 00:23:11,223
it spoils them, ya know?

332
00:23:11,306 --> 00:23:13,850
Oh, it looks great on you.

333
00:23:13,934 --> 00:23:15,602
Fucking asshole.

334
00:23:18,313 --> 00:23:21,733
I'm after this guy,
the one we talked about the other day.

335
00:23:21,817 --> 00:23:23,902
Fucking son of a bitch.

336
00:23:25,404 --> 00:23:27,239
So that was it, you slippery bastard?

337
00:23:27,948 --> 00:23:30,784
A bribe?
Just ignore it all and go to work?

338
00:23:31,535 --> 00:23:32,911
Keep your phone on.

339
00:23:32,994 --> 00:23:34,830
I'll hand it over on a silver platter.

340
00:23:35,997 --> 00:23:37,082
Fine, shithead.

341
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,964
Do it in one single blow.
That's all I ask.

342
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:46,007
Have fun.

343
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:50,387
Yun! The box! Hey, you're forgetting--

344
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:52,556
The expensive part. I'm taking it!

345
00:23:53,682 --> 00:23:55,100
Yun! Where are you going?

346
00:24:28,508 --> 00:24:30,802
Do your best.
Reach out to everyone.

347
00:24:31,511 --> 00:24:33,763
Whoever finds him first gets a million won

348
00:24:33,847 --> 00:24:35,932
and three months immunity from the cops.

349
00:24:36,016 --> 00:24:37,559
I never mentioned any immunity.

350
00:24:37,642 --> 00:24:40,312
You should motivate them
when they're doing so good, you know?

351
00:24:40,395 --> 00:24:41,605
Don't discourage them.

352
00:24:42,105 --> 00:24:44,107
Go find him. You're doing great.

353
00:24:44,191 --> 00:24:45,400
WANT TO BOOK YOON GILHO'S GIRLS

354
00:24:45,484 --> 00:24:46,693
ANYONE IN CONTACT WITH YOON?

355
00:24:48,778 --> 00:24:50,697
Jwipo, there are 31 people in the chat.

356
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:52,491
Why isn't anyone responding?

357
00:24:52,574 --> 00:24:54,826
Jangho, be patient.
I'm really doing my best here.

358
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:56,578
I'm doing my best.

359
00:24:56,661 --> 00:24:59,039
Oh! I have something.

360
00:25:01,208 --> 00:25:02,751
- Oh, no!
- Seriously?

361
00:25:02,834 --> 00:25:04,169
- What!
- Shit.

362
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:06,505
Reply to it. Hurry.

363
00:25:12,844 --> 00:25:14,638
DON'T YOU KNOW
HE SHUT DOWN AND WENT MIA?

364
00:25:14,721 --> 00:25:16,348
WHY DO YOU KEEP LOOKING FOR HIM?

365
00:25:16,431 --> 00:25:19,267
ARE YOU A FUCKING COP?

366
00:25:21,895 --> 00:25:24,481
FUCK, YOU CATCH ON FAST

367
00:25:24,564 --> 00:25:27,067
I'M JUST PLAYING

368
00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:29,778
YOON GILHO THAT FUCKER
STOLE MY MONEY

369
00:25:29,861 --> 00:25:32,447
I'M GONNA BRING HIM DOWN

370
00:25:32,531 --> 00:25:36,535
LOL, LOOKS LIKE
HE'S GOT MANY ENEMIES

371
00:25:38,495 --> 00:25:40,789
WHO ELSE WANTS HIM?

372
00:25:41,498 --> 00:25:42,832
PSYCHE SEEMED TO BE
GATHERING PEOPLE

373
00:25:42,916 --> 00:25:45,335
"Psyche"? Who's Psyche?

374
00:25:45,418 --> 00:25:46,545
Anybody know Psyche?

375
00:25:46,628 --> 00:25:47,587
Yeah, I do.

376
00:25:47,671 --> 00:25:50,465
He's a thug and a merchandiser.

377
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:52,050
He works for celebrities.

378
00:25:52,133 --> 00:25:54,052
-Where is he?
-I don't know.

379
00:25:55,011 --> 00:25:56,221
Then find him.

380
00:25:56,972 --> 00:25:58,515
Okay. Okay, I'll find him.

381
00:25:58,598 --> 00:26:01,309
WHEN? LET ME GET IN ON THAT

382
00:26:04,229 --> 00:26:05,814
TONIGHT, AT YEOKSAM JUNCTION

383
00:26:05,897 --> 00:26:07,732
- All right, you win.
- Whoo!

384
00:26:07,816 --> 00:26:10,110
- Let's call it a day.
- This is so fucking awesome.

385
00:26:22,831 --> 00:26:25,417
Fuck, why are you here alone?
Where's the girl?

386
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:26,626
And Noh Joonseo?

387
00:26:27,794 --> 00:26:29,254
-Where's he?
-Shit, man.

388
00:26:29,337 --> 00:26:31,548
Are you fucking crazy, huh?

389
00:26:31,631 --> 00:26:34,634
You always gotta bring the goods
to make the deal, asshole.

390
00:26:35,218 --> 00:26:36,553
You gotta make me an offer.

391
00:26:38,013 --> 00:26:38,847
Then the goods.

392
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:41,558
Go fetch Jenny
before I pull out of the deal.

393
00:26:42,142 --> 00:26:43,476
What… Hey!

394
00:26:45,895 --> 00:26:46,896
You're shitting me.

395
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:49,399
HE CAME ALONE

396
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:54,112
YEOKSAM STATION

397
00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:58,742
How do we know we'll find anything?
We just gonna wait here?

398
00:26:58,825 --> 00:27:00,535
I told you to just go, huh?

399
00:27:00,619 --> 00:27:02,329
Oh, come on. You need me.

400
00:27:02,996 --> 00:27:05,582
Remember you always needed me
whenever you were on a stakeout?

401
00:27:05,665 --> 00:27:07,876
You won't quit talking.
You hungry or something?

402
00:27:08,793 --> 00:27:10,545
I could go for a cup of noodles, yeah.

403
00:27:11,796 --> 00:27:13,381
I'm good. You go find some.

404
00:27:13,465 --> 00:27:16,009
I'll go get samgak gimbap and stuff.

405
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:46,289
Why are you fuckers
looking so hard for Jaehee?

406
00:27:46,373 --> 00:27:49,084
Don't you know why, you motherfucker?

407
00:27:49,167 --> 00:27:50,960
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.

408
00:27:52,545 --> 00:27:55,882
Let's just make this easy on everybody
and not complicate it.

409
00:27:55,965 --> 00:27:58,968
I want the girls and the motherfucking
tape they made, huh?

410
00:27:59,052 --> 00:27:59,928
The what?

411
00:28:00,011 --> 00:28:02,472
That video your bitches took, man.

412
00:28:05,308 --> 00:28:06,893
Oh, you didn't know about that?

413
00:28:06,976 --> 00:28:07,894
Oh.

414
00:28:08,728 --> 00:28:11,439
Hey, you should've let those girls
do their thing.

415
00:28:12,107 --> 00:28:13,817
You're not living in the dark ages,
my friend.

416
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:16,403
Your girls are women. All grown up.

417
00:28:16,486 --> 00:28:18,154
HE'S NOT WITH JENNY,
KNOWS NOTHING ABOUT THE VIDEO

418
00:28:18,238 --> 00:28:20,490
Just pampering them?
No, that won't do you any good.

419
00:28:23,451 --> 00:28:25,704
-So that's why?
-What?

420
00:28:25,787 --> 00:28:28,206
Is that why you killed Junghwa, you fuck?

421
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:31,876
Now, what?

422
00:28:38,049 --> 00:28:39,050
Hey.

423
00:28:39,134 --> 00:28:42,387
If you have any more questions,
why don't you ask these guys, you fuck.

424
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:44,013
What a rude little shit.

425
00:28:45,014 --> 00:28:45,932
Oh!

426
00:28:46,015 --> 00:28:46,933
One thing…

427
00:28:47,016 --> 00:28:48,518
I heard she was like…

428
00:28:49,602 --> 00:28:52,856
"Please don't kill me.
Please, please don't,"

429
00:28:52,939 --> 00:28:54,441
when she was begging not to die.

430
00:29:04,617 --> 00:29:07,120
JU YUN
MAJOR CRIMES DIVISION CAPTAIN

431
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:09,080
Yes?

432
00:29:09,164 --> 00:29:11,875
Yeah, I'll send you the location soon,
just bring the warrant.

433
00:29:11,958 --> 00:29:14,377
We're gonna catch the suspect tonight.

434
00:29:15,128 --> 00:29:17,672
Yoon Gilho? We caught him already?

435
00:29:17,756 --> 00:29:20,967
We gotta wrap this up
before Saturday, remember?

436
00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:22,969
Like Prosecutor Tak told us.

437
00:29:38,735 --> 00:29:40,111
Hey!

438
00:30:21,986 --> 00:30:23,279
Oh, shit, man.

439
00:30:24,364 --> 00:30:26,991
This bastard is on a whole other level.

440
00:30:27,075 --> 00:30:28,952
He's an artist. Yeah.

441
00:30:30,119 --> 00:30:32,831
Look. You should at least be on his level.

442
00:30:32,914 --> 00:30:35,291
No, no, no, no!

443
00:30:54,227 --> 00:30:56,479
JJOONI

444
00:30:58,857 --> 00:30:59,941
Fuck me.

445
00:31:17,333 --> 00:31:18,334
PSYCHE

446
00:31:20,461 --> 00:31:21,462
Come on.

447
00:31:32,348 --> 00:31:34,601
Noh Joonseo, you son of a bitch.

448
00:31:38,605 --> 00:31:40,106
Fuck! Oh, man!

449
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:42,400
Hey!

450
00:31:55,955 --> 00:31:57,081
Oi!

451
00:32:29,656 --> 00:32:30,740
Shit.

452
00:32:30,823 --> 00:32:32,951
Gilho!

453
00:32:33,034 --> 00:32:35,286
- Hey, Gilho! Where you at?
- Oh, my God, there's more.

454
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:38,081
You think you're good but
you can't take all of us, motherfucker.

455
00:32:47,757 --> 00:32:50,009
Get in! Come on, get in!

456
00:32:50,093 --> 00:32:51,844
- What are you doing? Go get him!
- Now!

457
00:32:52,345 --> 00:32:53,846
Come on. Go, go, go!

458
00:33:11,614 --> 00:33:13,366
Hey, Dongwoo!

459
00:33:13,449 --> 00:33:15,034
Dongwoo, where are you going?

460
00:33:16,828 --> 00:33:20,039
I told you to stay off my radar, huh?

461
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:23,584
Geez.

462
00:33:23,668 --> 00:33:25,211
Go get him. I mean it.

463
00:33:25,712 --> 00:33:27,255
Don't screw this up, or else.

464
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:31,843
Jesus.

465
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:35,471
Damn.

466
00:33:40,768 --> 00:33:41,853
Holy shit.

467
00:33:41,936 --> 00:33:43,146
LOCATION CHANGED
I'LL KEEP YOU POSTED

468
00:33:43,229 --> 00:33:46,065
Yes, Prosecutor Min. I'll send you
a different location. Take your time.

469
00:33:46,566 --> 00:33:48,192
I'll have to re-do the work though.

470
00:33:48,276 --> 00:33:49,444
What work? What do you mean?

471
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:51,154
Once the suspect starts talking,

472
00:33:51,237 --> 00:33:54,157
things will become
unnecessarily complicated.

473
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,908
I'd like to make it easier for you.

474
00:33:55,992 --> 00:33:57,869
What are you trying to pull here?

475
00:33:58,453 --> 00:34:00,538
Don't do anything. Wait until I get there.

476
00:34:00,621 --> 00:34:01,497
Do you understand me?

477
00:34:36,949 --> 00:34:38,284
Hey, where you been?

478
00:34:41,537 --> 00:34:43,331
Oh, is your face okay?

479
00:34:46,125 --> 00:34:47,794
Aren't you tired of this place yet?

480
00:34:48,294 --> 00:34:50,880
I don't like it here.
It's just too much like the old days.

481
00:34:52,381 --> 00:34:54,509
That's why I only come here when I'm sad.

482
00:34:55,009 --> 00:34:56,886
So I can think about the old days,

483
00:34:56,969 --> 00:35:01,432
and go "I'm so fucking successful.
I should work even fucking harder, huh?"

484
00:35:01,516 --> 00:35:03,059
All alone.

485
00:35:03,142 --> 00:35:04,227
You're right.

486
00:35:04,852 --> 00:35:06,604
We were so innocent once.

487
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:08,773
Innocent and humble.

488
00:35:08,856 --> 00:35:10,399
What are you saying?

489
00:35:10,483 --> 00:35:15,154
Remember, you told me once
we'd take over the country

490
00:35:15,238 --> 00:35:16,948
with hip-hop and dance.

491
00:35:17,782 --> 00:35:19,075
I was so happy.

492
00:35:20,076 --> 00:35:21,744
Ramyeon, soju for dinner.

493
00:35:22,537 --> 00:35:25,540
-After practicing all day--
-Damn, what's gotten into you?

494
00:35:25,623 --> 00:35:28,376
Why are you getting all sappy
and nostalgic on me?

495
00:35:35,466 --> 00:35:36,843
Look at you.

496
00:35:38,094 --> 00:35:39,345
Really?

497
00:35:49,730 --> 00:35:51,899
God, what is up with you?

498
00:36:01,868 --> 00:36:04,245
You're still an immature kid,
aren't ya.

499
00:36:04,745 --> 00:36:06,205
When are you gonna grow up?

500
00:36:08,249 --> 00:36:09,250
Hey.

501
00:36:11,419 --> 00:36:12,420
Hey!

502
00:36:14,297 --> 00:36:16,174
Another soju.

503
00:36:19,427 --> 00:36:22,638
Oh, hey. Can I get a soju?

504
00:36:22,722 --> 00:36:24,098
Hi. Are you Lee Gangsu?

505
00:36:24,182 --> 00:36:26,392
-Who are you?
-Can I get an autograph?

506
00:36:31,063 --> 00:36:32,565
Ah, you're a fan?

507
00:36:34,358 --> 00:36:36,235
So, what's your name, kiddo?

508
00:37:19,987 --> 00:37:22,114
MR. CHOI

509
00:37:25,076 --> 00:37:26,702
Hello, sir. I'm Noh Joonseo.

510
00:37:27,203 --> 00:37:28,621
You know who I am, right?

511
00:37:29,163 --> 00:37:30,248
Yeah, I thought so.

512
00:37:35,586 --> 00:37:37,546
If you allow me to speak my mind freely,

513
00:37:39,257 --> 00:37:42,802
your greedy little friend, Lee Gangsu,
is of no use anymore.

514
00:37:44,178 --> 00:37:47,682
Gangnam Trading Company
is ready for a new CEO.

515
00:37:51,769 --> 00:37:53,145
Kim Jaehee. Where is she?

516
00:37:54,188 --> 00:37:56,232
You bastard, where is she?

517
00:37:57,316 --> 00:37:58,776
You gotta know where she is.

518
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:01,487
Yeah?

519
00:38:01,570 --> 00:38:03,614
And why stick the dead girl's body
right there?

520
00:38:03,698 --> 00:38:04,949
Ah, shit.

521
00:38:05,783 --> 00:38:07,243
What…

522
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:10,329
Ah, shit. Pull yourself together,
all right?

523
00:38:10,413 --> 00:38:11,872
Answer me. Come on.

524
00:38:12,707 --> 00:38:14,750
It's none of your fucking business.

525
00:38:15,793 --> 00:38:18,004
You weren't the one who killed her, huh?

526
00:38:18,921 --> 00:38:20,172
It wasn't you, was it?

527
00:38:31,058 --> 00:38:33,436
Almost there.
Almost there. Almost there.

528
00:38:33,519 --> 00:38:35,271
We got him. We got him.

529
00:38:35,354 --> 00:38:36,480
Step on it. Hurry!

530
00:38:40,776 --> 00:38:44,739
What kind of cop keeps swinging
and missing every time?

531
00:38:45,281 --> 00:38:46,282
What?

532
00:38:48,367 --> 00:38:49,618
Gangnam Trading.

533
00:38:50,119 --> 00:38:51,787
Do you really think
they're completely gone

534
00:38:51,871 --> 00:38:54,457
just 'cause three years ago
you stirred things up a little?

535
00:38:55,124 --> 00:38:56,250
For fuck's sake.

536
00:39:03,382 --> 00:39:06,010
Damn, what the hell is going on?

537
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:10,222
Goddamn it.

538
00:39:13,976 --> 00:39:15,603
Hey! Shit.

539
00:39:18,356 --> 00:39:20,274
What the hell is this?

540
00:39:28,949 --> 00:39:30,034
Ah, shit.

541
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:37,416
Are you okay?

542
00:39:43,506 --> 00:39:44,507
Jesus.

543
00:39:49,011 --> 00:39:50,471
The fuck are you doing here?

544
00:39:50,554 --> 00:39:51,389
What?

545
00:39:51,472 --> 00:39:54,433
Do not get in our way, Kang Dongwoo.
Not today.

546
00:39:56,018 --> 00:39:58,229
The fuck are you messing around with
this time?

547
00:39:58,312 --> 00:39:59,605
- Hey!
- No bullshit.

548
00:39:59,688 --> 00:40:01,273
Get out of the car.

549
00:40:04,985 --> 00:40:06,404
Don't get out of the car.

550
00:40:06,987 --> 00:40:08,572
I said, don't.

551
00:40:09,448 --> 00:40:11,075
Geez, he's hurt pretty bad.

552
00:40:11,158 --> 00:40:13,744
-Back off!
-Shit! Dongwoo, stop there. Don't move.

553
00:40:13,828 --> 00:40:15,746
Why are you pointing that at me?

554
00:40:16,705 --> 00:40:19,125
Do you have any fucking idea
who you're aiming at?

555
00:40:19,208 --> 00:40:21,001
Put it down, you bastard!

556
00:40:21,544 --> 00:40:24,004
-What are you doing, huh?
-You're dead, you shit-bag.

557
00:40:24,088 --> 00:40:26,257
- Let's go.
- Put the gun down, I said!

558
00:40:26,841 --> 00:40:28,509
You motherfuckers.

559
00:40:28,592 --> 00:40:29,927
Shit!

560
00:40:31,762 --> 00:40:34,098
Get him now! What the fuck are you doing?

561
00:40:37,184 --> 00:40:38,894
- Back off! Back off!
- Hey, hey, hey!

562
00:40:39,478 --> 00:40:40,771
Back off, you bastards.

563
00:40:43,941 --> 00:40:46,152
Stay away from him
or I'll shoot you all down.

564
00:40:50,781 --> 00:40:53,075
You haven't reloaded from the first round.

565
00:40:53,159 --> 00:40:54,243
Man, are you crazy?

566
00:40:54,326 --> 00:40:57,538
Dongwoo, you lunatic.
This is none of your fucking business.

567
00:40:57,621 --> 00:40:59,248
I'm just doing my damn job, Yun!

568
00:40:59,331 --> 00:41:02,334
Now, put those guns down.
Guns down, bastards!

569
00:41:04,086 --> 00:41:06,547
Dongwoo, could you please
read the fucking situation?

570
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:09,675
It isn't your job to die right now,
you fucking idiot!

571
00:41:12,386 --> 00:41:14,013
If you're willing to die for this…

572
00:41:14,096 --> 00:41:15,097
Fuck.

573
00:41:15,931 --> 00:41:17,266
Who ordered this?

574
00:41:18,142 --> 00:41:20,186
This fucking guy.

575
00:41:20,269 --> 00:41:21,645
What are you doing?

576
00:41:35,534 --> 00:41:36,994
Goddamn it. Hey! Don't shoot!

577
00:41:37,077 --> 00:41:38,454
Don't shoot, I said!

578
00:41:40,247 --> 00:41:41,499
He was right there!

579
00:41:41,582 --> 00:41:43,626
- Out of the way. Move.
- Fucker.
