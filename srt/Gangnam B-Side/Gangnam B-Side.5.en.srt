1
00:00:29,446 --> 00:00:32,699
Someone must have called her
to go out there, didn't they?

2
00:00:32,782 --> 00:00:34,534
[caller] Tomorrow, 1:00 a.m.

3
00:00:34,617 --> 00:00:37,495
Bring the video that Kim Jaehee
and your daughter have.

4
00:00:37,579 --> 00:00:39,456
I'll send the address. Come alone.

5
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:42,042
So, the last call came from Apgujeong.

6
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:44,377
The phone was turned off
as soon as the call ended.

7
00:00:44,461 --> 00:00:46,546
Why do you want to know
where Yeseo's phone is?

8
00:00:46,629 --> 00:00:48,131
Just send me the location, okay?

9
00:00:48,214 --> 00:00:49,299
[Jisu] Captain Kang.

10
00:00:49,799 --> 00:00:52,343
The Commissioner
is looking for you right now.

11
00:00:52,427 --> 00:00:54,888
He wants you to give Noh Joonseo's
case to Major Crimes.

12
00:00:54,971 --> 00:00:56,473
You need to come here and sort this out--

13
00:00:56,556 --> 00:00:57,891
Could you take care of Noh Joonseo's case?

14
00:00:57,974 --> 00:01:01,227
And keep checking Yeseo's phone,
in case it turns on again.

15
00:01:01,936 --> 00:01:03,646
[sighs] I'd appreciate it.

16
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:10,904
[whimpering]

17
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:13,406
[footsteps approaching]

18
00:01:14,282 --> 00:01:16,201
[whimpering intensifies]

19
00:01:22,415 --> 00:01:24,417
[person yelling, groaning]

20
00:01:26,044 --> 00:01:28,088
[person 2 moaning, laughing]

21
00:01:32,008 --> 00:01:34,010
[moaning continues]

22
00:01:41,392 --> 00:01:43,937
-Hey!
-[escort moaning, giggling]

23
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:47,607
I guess Jaehee didn't tell you
about this place, did she?

24
00:01:48,274 --> 00:01:50,318
Jaehee? Do you know Jaehee?

25
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:53,905
In this business, you'd be an idiot
to not know who Jenny is.

26
00:01:53,988 --> 00:01:57,075
Not many girls go from rock bottom
all the way to the top.

27
00:01:58,993 --> 00:02:00,120
"Jenny"?

28
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:05,458
Then, um, you must know
where Jaehee is then, right?

29
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:16,511
How much do you know about Kim Jaehee?

30
00:02:16,594 --> 00:02:18,054
What do you…

31
00:02:19,055 --> 00:02:20,390
Worry about yourself.

32
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:23,101
It doesn't take much time
to become like them.

33
00:02:25,019 --> 00:02:27,021
[gasping]

34
00:02:27,605 --> 00:02:29,065
Jaehee saved my life.

35
00:02:30,358 --> 00:02:32,318
That's why I'm trying to help her.

36
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:35,488
Because we're friends.

37
00:03:29,167 --> 00:03:32,420
GANGNAM B-SIDE

38
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:35,089
2 YEARS AGO

39
00:03:35,173 --> 00:03:38,259
[student 1] That fucking bitch acts
as if she's a fucking angel.

40
00:03:38,343 --> 00:03:42,555
[student 2] Hey, did you see her earlier?
Bitch doesn't even get scared anymore.

41
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:44,557
[student 3]
I fucking hate the way she looks at me.

42
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:47,060
[student 2] Where the hell is she?
Seriously, where did she go?

43
00:03:47,143 --> 00:03:49,020
[student 1] She's probably crying
somewhere like an idiot.

44
00:03:49,103 --> 00:03:51,773
-[student 4] I saw her leaving earlier.
-[student 1] Who wants to find her?

45
00:03:51,856 --> 00:03:53,691
-[student 2] I do!
-[student 3] Come on, let's go.

46
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:55,610
[door opens, closes]

47
00:03:55,693 --> 00:03:57,362
[footsteps]

48
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:09,749
What are you doing?

49
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:12,168
[student 1] Hey, grab her.

50
00:04:12,794 --> 00:04:15,213
Let me see. Where do you want it?

51
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:18,633
[student 1] How about here?
Or maybe the left?

52
00:04:18,716 --> 00:04:21,469
I think it'll look pretty as fuck,
you little bitch.

53
00:04:21,552 --> 00:04:24,138
You better not rat us out-- [screams]

54
00:04:26,224 --> 00:04:27,684
[gasps]

55
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:29,185
Let's see.

56
00:04:30,228 --> 00:04:33,022
-Should I cut her? Huh? Yes?
-[student 1] I'm sorry.

57
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:36,109
I was wrong. [whimpering]

58
00:04:37,026 --> 00:04:38,152
I'm so sorry!

59
00:04:38,236 --> 00:04:41,948
Fucking answer me. Don't just
stand there like a fucking idiot!

60
00:04:44,033 --> 00:04:45,743
[Yeseo] I never asked for your help.

61
00:04:52,583 --> 00:04:55,795
Why did you do that?
Is it because you pity me?

62
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:59,632
No, I don't have any pity
for bitches like you.

63
00:05:00,216 --> 00:05:02,802
-Why not?
-[scoffs] Why do you think?

64
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:06,222
Because your normal parents
made your life so good

65
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:08,599
you can't even fight back against bullies.

66
00:05:14,647 --> 00:05:18,234
Your weak ass ain't got what it takes.
Little princess.

67
00:05:21,446 --> 00:05:23,281
How can I become stronger then?

68
00:05:24,866 --> 00:05:27,618
How… How can I be like you?

69
00:05:50,558 --> 00:05:51,893
[shouts, groans]

70
00:05:51,976 --> 00:05:53,269
What's wrong?

71
00:05:53,895 --> 00:05:56,105
Why don't you call your rescuer?

72
00:05:57,231 --> 00:06:00,360
-Come on, bitch. I told you to call her.
-[bullies giggle]

73
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:03,613
[faintly] Apolo… Apologize.

74
00:06:03,696 --> 00:06:05,406
The hell is this bitch saying?

75
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:07,033
Can you hear her?

76
00:06:07,575 --> 00:06:09,744
I said, what the fuck are you saying?

77
00:06:09,827 --> 00:06:12,330
-I said apologize, you fucking bitch!
-[bullies gasp]

78
00:06:12,413 --> 00:06:14,082
-[bully] Fuck!
-[bully 2] She's fucking crazy!

79
00:06:14,165 --> 00:06:15,958
-Go ahead.
-Are you serious?

80
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:17,210
Fucking go ahead, I said!

81
00:06:17,293 --> 00:06:18,461
[Jaehee] Hey!

82
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:21,881
Fuck off.

83
00:06:24,592 --> 00:06:27,678
-Come on, I said fuck off.
-Hey. Let's go.

84
00:06:31,557 --> 00:06:32,642
Hey, Kang Yeseo.

85
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:35,228
Put that down.

86
00:06:36,187 --> 00:06:37,438
Come on, put it down.

87
00:06:39,857 --> 00:06:41,943
Die! You fucking bitch!

88
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:43,986
[screams]

89
00:06:49,951 --> 00:06:52,370
Hey. Hey! Look at me.

90
00:06:53,037 --> 00:06:56,332
Listen. That bitch fell off the roof
all on her own like a dumbass.

91
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:59,377
And it's just bad luck
that we happened to be here. Got it?

92
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:01,254
I pushed her. I did.

93
00:07:01,337 --> 00:07:03,506
Hey. Hey, get ahold of yourself, come on.

94
00:07:04,132 --> 00:07:06,676
-Shit. Snap out of it!
-I…

95
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:10,054
And this. She did this too, all right?

96
00:07:10,138 --> 00:07:13,182
Yeseo, there's no need
to feel guilty, it's not your fault.

97
00:07:13,766 --> 00:07:17,395
Don't say anything stupid. You hear me?

98
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:28,906
[whimpers]

99
00:07:39,167 --> 00:07:41,377
[Jisu]
So, the last call came from Apgujeong.

100
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:43,421
The phone was turned off
as soon as the call ended.

101
00:07:43,504 --> 00:07:46,048
Why do you want to
know where Yeseo's phone is?

102
00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:49,886
HANGIL CLEANING SERVICE

103
00:07:52,013 --> 00:07:53,139
[Dongwoo] "Deep-clean?"

104
00:07:53,222 --> 00:07:56,184
[Jisu] Yeah, they said the people from
the company called Hangil Cleaning Service

105
00:07:56,267 --> 00:07:57,852
come once a month for cleaning.

106
00:07:57,935 --> 00:08:00,396
I tried calling them,
but it's not a working number.

107
00:08:03,816 --> 00:08:05,943
-[handle rattles]
-[knocks]

108
00:08:33,471 --> 00:08:34,680
[sighs]

109
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:38,935
[gasps]

110
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:51,197
[groans]

111
00:09:00,122 --> 00:09:01,541
[grunts, gasps]

112
00:09:04,794 --> 00:09:07,588
[Dongwoo] If you get caught, the media
and prosecution will be all over you.

113
00:09:07,672 --> 00:09:09,298
You can't be here. Go now!

114
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:11,968
I'll do whatever it takes
to protect Jaehee.

115
00:09:12,635 --> 00:09:13,761
Go, now.

116
00:09:14,262 --> 00:09:16,639
[sirens in the distance]

117
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:20,309
[Gilho] You have to protect Jaehee.

118
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:26,023
We'll observe how this progresses
and follow up with you.

119
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:29,026
-Get some rest.
-Thank you.

120
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:35,533
[sighs]

121
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:45,918
They took Jinyoung to a rehab center.

122
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:48,087
Apparently her addiction is pretty severe.

123
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:50,172
What about Mr. Yoon?

124
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:53,009
[clicks tongue] Yoon Gilho?

125
00:09:54,677 --> 00:09:56,178
He's gone missing again.

126
00:09:58,723 --> 00:10:00,016
[chuckles]

127
00:10:01,684 --> 00:10:02,935
[sighs]

128
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:06,856
Mr. Kang…

129
00:10:07,815 --> 00:10:09,692
don't tell Yeseo I'm here, if that's cool.

130
00:10:10,401 --> 00:10:11,611
Why not?

131
00:10:13,487 --> 00:10:16,907
She'll probably cry
if she sees me like this.

132
00:10:18,492 --> 00:10:19,702
[sighs]

133
00:10:21,245 --> 00:10:22,496
[exhales deeply]

134
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:27,460
Jaehee.

135
00:10:30,087 --> 00:10:31,213
Where's the video?

136
00:10:37,178 --> 00:10:38,721
Uh, I don't have it.

137
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:43,768
They're after you right now.
They're after you because of that video.

138
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:50,107
You think I'm stupid?

139
00:10:50,941 --> 00:10:53,903
Keeping it would have
made it too easy for those bastards.

140
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:55,571
I gave it to someone.

141
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:56,739
You gave it…

142
00:10:57,323 --> 00:10:59,408
Who did you give it to? Who has it?

143
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,456
Jaehee, you're in serious danger
because of that.

144
00:11:05,539 --> 00:11:08,250
I'm trying to help you right now. Okay?

145
00:11:15,466 --> 00:11:18,928
Could you get me some food first?
I'm so hungry. [chuckles]

146
00:11:26,644 --> 00:11:28,062
-[Dongwoo] Here.
-[Jaehee] Hurry.

147
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:38,864
You're gonna buy me anything I want?

148
00:12:13,023 --> 00:12:14,316
[phone buzzing]

149
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:17,945
Yeah?

150
00:12:18,028 --> 00:12:20,406
-[person] Do you even know…
-Captain, where are you?

151
00:12:20,489 --> 00:12:22,491
Your wife just came to the station.

152
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:25,327
[groans] Geez, man.

153
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:28,789
-Did something really happen to Yeseo?
-[Dongwoo's wife] At least give me…

154
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:35,129
Jesus. Is it related to
Gangnam Trading Company?

155
00:12:35,212 --> 00:12:36,547
[Dongwoo's wife] Where is she right now?

156
00:12:37,214 --> 00:12:38,424
[sighs]

157
00:12:38,507 --> 00:12:39,842
Yeah.

158
00:12:40,676 --> 00:12:43,095
[sighs] Oh, those fucking assholes.

159
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:47,183
I'll report her as missing
and dispatch a team right away.

160
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:49,935
We can start the search
from the location we found earlier.

161
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:52,229
No, if we move too hastily, Yeseo…

162
00:12:53,856 --> 00:12:56,317
Yeseo could be in serious trouble.

163
00:12:57,485 --> 00:13:01,155
[sighs] Tell my wife she needs to go home.
Make up an excuse if you have to.

164
00:13:01,238 --> 00:13:03,240
Those bastards want something from me.

165
00:13:05,659 --> 00:13:07,369
All right. Let's talk later.

166
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:09,622
Are you ready to go?

167
00:13:10,748 --> 00:13:12,082
Can you ring these up please?

168
00:13:14,502 --> 00:13:15,961
-[sighs]
-[register beeping]

169
00:13:17,505 --> 00:13:19,340
-Can I eat this first?
-[cashier] Yeah, sure.

170
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:21,801
-I'll heat this up, okay?
-Okay.

171
00:13:25,888 --> 00:13:27,014
[sighs]

172
00:13:31,769 --> 00:13:32,770
[beeping continues]

173
00:13:33,354 --> 00:13:34,563
[Jaehee] Mr. Kang.

174
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:35,648
Mmm?

175
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:37,650
Try to be good to Yeseo.

176
00:13:38,901 --> 00:13:40,986
Stop feeding her burgers everyday,
you know?

177
00:13:42,112 --> 00:13:44,824
What? Come on, it's not like
I bought her burgers every day.

178
00:13:45,908 --> 00:13:47,034
[scoffs] Man.

179
00:13:47,117 --> 00:13:48,994
[cashier] That'll be 28,500 won.

180
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:58,879
Jaehee, you didn't give that video…

181
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:02,716
you didn't give it to Yeseo, right?

182
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:11,058
Jaehee?

183
00:14:12,977 --> 00:14:14,144
Jaehee.

184
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:17,481
Goddamn it.

185
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:22,152
[panting]

186
00:14:22,236 --> 00:14:24,154
No, no, no.

187
00:14:30,995 --> 00:14:33,914
I checked all the roads
around the convenience store,

188
00:14:33,998 --> 00:14:35,541
but because of the rain,

189
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:41,505
checking all the dash cams, too…
It will take at least a couple of days.

190
00:14:51,098 --> 00:14:52,182
[sighs]

191
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:18,918
DONGSEONG FERRY

192
00:15:19,001 --> 00:15:20,920
Leaves two nights from now.

193
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:22,421
That's the name of the boat.

194
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:26,258
What are you doing?

195
00:15:26,342 --> 00:15:29,345
Look, I barely managed to get this gig
so just go away.

196
00:15:30,137 --> 00:15:32,056
There's nothing you can do here
now anyway.

197
00:15:33,265 --> 00:15:35,893
That bastard Noh Joonseo is dead,
and Jaehee is safe at the hospital.

198
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:39,188
I mean, come on.
Doesn't that mean it's all fucking over?

199
00:15:40,856 --> 00:15:43,525
Over? Nothing's over.

200
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:46,654
What about Noh Joonseo's crew, man?

201
00:15:46,737 --> 00:15:50,032
You really think that bastard
Noh Joonseo committed suicide?

202
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:51,784
What if you're wrong?

203
00:15:52,576 --> 00:15:54,411
What are you going to do then?

204
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:59,583
You said that the fucking cop
promised he'd protect Jaehee.

205
00:16:02,044 --> 00:16:04,463
It's a chance for Jaehee
to start a new life.

206
00:16:13,555 --> 00:16:14,974
[grunting, panting]

207
00:16:17,101 --> 00:16:18,769
[grunting, gasping]

208
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:41,959
Hey, there. Young lady?

209
00:16:44,878 --> 00:16:48,590
Hello, I'm in front of Unit 803,
and I just found a girl…

210
00:16:50,926 --> 00:16:53,178
[groaning, breathing heavily]

211
00:16:55,305 --> 00:16:57,975
I told you to teach her a lesson,
not ruin her face.

212
00:16:58,976 --> 00:17:01,812
What's the matter with you, huh? Geez.

213
00:17:03,939 --> 00:17:05,274
She hurt you, yeah?

214
00:17:13,323 --> 00:17:16,618
If I find out you made a copy,
you'll be as good as dead.

215
00:17:17,494 --> 00:17:18,662
You know that, right?

216
00:17:19,621 --> 00:17:22,166
Even if I say I didn't,
you won't believe me anyway.

217
00:17:23,417 --> 00:17:25,252
Just fucking kill me.

218
00:17:27,337 --> 00:17:31,175
Come on. It'd be a waste to just kill you.

219
00:17:31,258 --> 00:17:32,384
Get off me.

220
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:37,097
[chuckles]

221
00:17:39,475 --> 00:17:42,144
You've had a nice, cozy time
with the boys in Gangnam.

222
00:17:42,227 --> 00:17:44,354
To celebrate the launch
of the new server, I'll make you

223
00:17:44,438 --> 00:17:46,231
the main event with full options.

224
00:17:47,983 --> 00:17:49,651
So why don't we take this opportunity

225
00:17:49,735 --> 00:17:52,863
to really kick back and have a good time,
huh? What do you say?

226
00:17:53,822 --> 00:17:55,240
What's the word, Jaehee?

227
00:17:56,533 --> 00:17:57,451
Okay?

228
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:01,830
Cover her scars, all right?

229
00:18:11,173 --> 00:18:12,508
[sighs]

230
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:15,594
[door opens]

231
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:23,227
Yeseo.

232
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:27,439
Yeseo.

233
00:18:28,857 --> 00:18:30,234
Are you okay, sweetheart?

234
00:18:48,001 --> 00:18:51,296
It hurt so fucking bad.
I guess it's been a while.

235
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:53,048
[both chuckle]

236
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:54,675
-Did it really hurt?
-[chuckles]

237
00:18:55,717 --> 00:18:58,137
I meant to only hit the parts
that could be seen.

238
00:19:02,349 --> 00:19:03,350
How's Yeseo?

239
00:19:04,685 --> 00:19:06,228
Did she get away clean?

240
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,151
You didn't beat her like me, did you?

241
00:19:12,234 --> 00:19:13,652
You crazy psycho.

242
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:16,405
Geez, what are you worried about her for?

243
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:17,614
Worry about yourself.

244
00:19:18,198 --> 00:19:21,243
Geez, Choi Suin. Quit nagging.

245
00:19:25,747 --> 00:19:27,499
She said you saved her, you know,

246
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:31,295
so she had to do something for you too.

247
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:36,758
That's not true.

248
00:19:40,345 --> 00:19:41,972
She's the one who saved me.

249
00:19:54,943 --> 00:19:56,987
Remember the backdoor exit we used to use?

250
00:19:57,487 --> 00:19:59,656
I put some clothes and some cash there.

251
00:20:01,325 --> 00:20:03,952
I'll try to stall, so hurry and get out.
Go.

252
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:10,042
And live with Gilho somewhere
as far away as possible.

253
00:20:10,959 --> 00:20:13,670
Don't you ever come back
to Gangnam again. Okay?

254
00:20:18,091 --> 00:20:19,301
If you let me go,

255
00:20:21,178 --> 00:20:22,512
they'll fucking kill you.

256
00:20:24,348 --> 00:20:25,557
Fuck you.

257
00:20:26,308 --> 00:20:28,602
A bitch like me is built to survive,
all right?

258
00:20:29,603 --> 00:20:32,397
So stop with the bullshit
and go while I let you.

259
00:20:34,983 --> 00:20:37,569
That's pretty fucking moving,
and I thank you for that.

260
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,322
I'm done running away.

261
00:20:46,161 --> 00:20:48,497
I should've done this ages ago.

262
00:20:50,499 --> 00:20:52,292
I've dragged it out too long.

263
00:21:05,555 --> 00:21:09,184
Suin, do me a favor, please?

264
00:21:15,816 --> 00:21:16,942
[phone buzzing]

265
00:21:17,025 --> 00:21:18,318

266
00:21:20,862 --> 00:21:22,739
-What are you doing? Hop in.
-[line ringing]

267
00:21:23,699 --> 00:21:24,866

269
00:21:27,327 --> 00:21:29,746

to protect Jaehee.

00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:30,872

271
00:21:30,956 --> 00:21:31,999

272
00:21:32,082 --> 00:21:34,084

Hey, did you find something?

278
00:21:45,637 --> 00:21:47,889
[Jangho] The name of the girl
you're looking for is Jenny, right?

279
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:48,849
Did you find her?

280
00:21:48,932 --> 00:21:51,560
I just came across a link
to a new deep web server

281
00:21:51,643 --> 00:21:54,521
on the pimp's chats. Yeah, click on that.

282
00:21:54,604 --> 00:21:57,357
You need to take a look at this.
I'll send you the link.

283
00:21:58,150 --> 00:21:59,609
-[phone buzzes]
-Okay, sent.

284
00:21:59,693 --> 00:22:00,819
JENNY'S COMEBACK EVENT!

285
00:22:00,902 --> 00:22:03,947
To just gain access to the server,
costs a million won

286
00:22:04,031 --> 00:22:06,825
And it's 100,000
for every additional three minutes.

287
00:22:06,908 --> 00:22:08,243
And it seems you can auction requests.

WITH FULL OPTIONS

289
00:22:09,661 --> 00:22:11,872
Is there a way to figure out
where this is being filmed?

290

Where is it filmed?

291
00:22:14,916 --> 00:22:16,585
[stammers] Hold on.

292
00:22:17,252 --> 00:22:20,213
Based on the chat,
it seems like it's real-time streaming.

293
00:22:20,297 --> 00:22:21,381
Oh, fuck's sake.

294
00:22:21,465 --> 00:22:24,217
We need to figure out
what this place is to find that girl.

295

IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME

296

Where's Jaehee, you bastard?

352
00:27:16,384 --> 00:27:18,303
You sent Kim Jaehee to us.

353
00:27:19,721 --> 00:27:21,640
We traded her for your daughter.

354
00:27:25,352 --> 00:27:28,104
Yeseo is such a pretty girl.

355
00:27:28,188 --> 00:27:29,564
[straining]

356
00:27:32,317 --> 00:27:33,526
[glass shatters]

357
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:35,320
[Jaehee] Are you watching me, babe?

358
00:27:36,154 --> 00:27:39,157
I said, are you watching me,
you fucking bastards?

359
00:27:40,784 --> 00:27:43,370
Oh, shit. What the fuck is she doing?

360
00:27:50,043 --> 00:27:51,169
Oh, Jesus.

361
00:27:52,587 --> 00:27:54,047
Get down from there!

362
00:27:55,548 --> 00:27:56,758
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

363
00:27:56,841 --> 00:27:58,009
HARDER!

364
00:27:58,093 --> 00:27:59,219
HYPE TODAY

365
00:28:00,136 --> 00:28:04,015
I get to decide my ending.
I fucking decide.

366
00:28:05,684 --> 00:28:09,062
[shouting] You'll never get what you want!

367
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:15,443
You'll never get what you fucking want.

368
00:28:16,695 --> 00:28:18,279
[chuckling]

369
00:28:20,156 --> 00:28:21,157

[gasping]

372
00:28:46,808 --> 00:28:48,101
Fucking bastards.

373
00:28:48,601 --> 00:28:50,019
See you in hell.

374
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:00,822
-[car alarm blaring]
-[bystanders clamoring]

375
00:29:00,905 --> 00:29:01,906
[bystander] What the fuck.

376
00:29:03,825 --> 00:29:05,493
This fucking bitch.

377
00:29:17,172 --> 00:29:19,799

379
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:34,397
-[officer] Please stay back.
-Is she breathing?

380
00:29:36,024 --> 00:29:37,567
-[officer] Step back.
-Look man, I don't know.

381
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:39,486
-Wait, are you sure?
-She's not breathing.

382
00:29:39,569 --> 00:29:41,070
I don't have any information…

383
00:29:41,154 --> 00:29:43,615
-Please, for your own safety.
-Step back.

384
00:29:45,658 --> 00:29:47,243
[breathing heavily]

385
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:53,249
[Gilho] Jaehee!

386
00:29:55,794 --> 00:29:59,839
Jaehee! Oh, my God, no!

387
00:29:59,923 --> 00:30:01,257
Jaehee!

[stammering]

389
00:30:03,885 --> 00:30:06,429
Fuck! [sobs]

390
00:30:06,513 --> 00:30:07,680
Jaehee.

391
00:30:08,431 --> 00:30:09,641
No!

392
00:30:11,935 --> 00:30:13,478
Jaehee!

393
00:30:14,312 --> 00:30:15,355
Let go!

394
00:30:15,438 --> 00:30:16,773
Let go of me!

395
00:30:48,972 --> 00:30:51,724

396
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:53,810
[groans]

397
00:31:35,268 --> 00:31:38,980
-[bystander] I was just walking and then…
-[officer] What time was that?

398
00:31:41,316 --> 00:31:44,235
[Jaehee, on phone speaker] Hey, it's me.

399
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:47,071
How are you?

400
00:31:50,408 --> 00:31:53,578
I was going to call you, but…

401
00:31:55,496 --> 00:31:57,040
you might've changed my mind.

402
00:32:00,001 --> 00:32:01,711
Are you still mad at me?

403
00:32:04,756 --> 00:32:08,551
You know, when I was harsh with you

404
00:32:09,135 --> 00:32:10,970
I did that on purpose, right?

405
00:32:12,138 --> 00:32:14,182
I didn't want you to stay miserable.

406
00:32:15,725 --> 00:32:18,269
-I know how fucking petty you are.
-[both chuckle]

407
00:32:26,235 --> 00:32:27,445
You know what?

408
00:32:36,579 --> 00:32:40,833
That day, on the roof, you saved my life.

409
00:32:41,417 --> 00:32:42,961
-[Yeseo] You fucking bitch!
-[bully shouts]

410
00:32:43,044 --> 00:32:45,672
-Have you lost your fucking mind?
-[bully 2] You're fucking crazy.

411
00:32:45,755 --> 00:32:47,924
Come on, come at me! Go ahead.

412
00:32:51,094 --> 00:32:52,136
Hey.

413
00:32:52,845 --> 00:32:54,806
[Jaehee] So don't act like you're weak.

414
00:32:54,889 --> 00:32:56,140
Fuck this. Let's go.

415
00:32:56,224 --> 00:32:58,142
Let's get out of here,
that one's even crazier.

416
00:32:58,226 --> 00:32:59,894
You're stronger than I am.

417
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:03,064
You're born to be that bitch, you know.

418
00:33:05,733 --> 00:33:07,485
You're the one who saved my life.

419
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:09,487
[chuckles]

420
00:33:12,907 --> 00:33:14,742
I know this is so fucking cringey…

421
00:33:17,829 --> 00:33:23,167
but I thought I should tell you this
before I go.

422
00:33:30,008 --> 00:33:32,552
Thank you for that, Kang Yeseo.

423
00:33:54,115 --> 00:33:55,116
[sniffles]

424
00:34:11,924 --> 00:34:13,968

431
00:35:14,946 --> 00:35:16,906
You killed both Jaehee and me.

432
00:35:20,493 --> 00:35:22,203
This is on you, Dad.

00:36:03,411 --> 00:36:06,247
I'll be hanging out with Junghwa
so she doesn't get bored.

437
00:36:08,583 --> 00:36:11,586
Don't get too happy that
this annoying bitch is out of your hair.

438
00:36:14,922 --> 00:36:18,509
Thanks for everything, Minseok.

Hey.

442
00:36:40,865 --> 00:36:42,950
You make it clear to that bastard K

443
00:36:44,285 --> 00:36:47,246
that he better stick close
to that motherfucking Mr. Choi.

444
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,875
Let him know I'm coming for him.

THIS IS PROSECUTOR MIN SEOJIN
FROM SEOUL PROSECUTION

459
00:38:59,128 --> 00:39:03,215
I'D LIKE TO TALK ABOUT YOU,
MR. CHOI HAKGU

460
00:39:07,219 --> 00:39:08,220
[phone buzzes]

461
00:39:11,724 --> 00:39:14,185
I'M IMPRESSED THAT YOU FOUND ME

462
00:39:14,852 --> 00:39:15,853
[phone buzzes]

463
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:19,398
SHALL WE MEET?

464
00:40:18,666 --> 00:40:20,251
A bit shabby, isn't it?

465
00:40:21,001 --> 00:40:23,587
Not suitable for a prosecutor like you?

466
00:40:23,671 --> 00:40:27,550
It may not look like much,
but nearly every restaurant in Gangnam

467
00:40:28,092 --> 00:40:30,136
happens to owe some sort
of debt to this store.

468
00:40:30,219 --> 00:40:31,929
I'm not interested in history.

469
00:40:33,139 --> 00:40:34,849
What did you want to see me about?

470
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:39,228
You were the one
who contacted me first, weren't you?

471
00:40:40,229 --> 00:40:42,815
You must have something in mind
if you've come here

472
00:40:43,315 --> 00:40:47,278
instead of preparing to be demoted
to the role of small town investigator

473
00:40:48,028 --> 00:40:50,281
so what is it
you'd like to speak with me about?

474
00:40:57,455 --> 00:41:00,249
Here's what I have on
Gangnam Trading Company and on you.

475
00:41:00,332 --> 00:41:02,626
If I go ahead and expose all this,

476
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:05,463
Tak Juil's corruption
will be brought to light

477
00:41:05,546 --> 00:41:07,715
and so will his connection to you,
Mr. Choi.

478
00:41:09,758 --> 00:41:10,801
Go ahead.

479
00:41:12,011 --> 00:41:16,015
Did you actually believe
we wouldn't be prepared for such a thing?

480
00:41:25,316 --> 00:41:26,984
I've been keeping an eye on you.

481
00:41:27,693 --> 00:41:30,237
You come across as laid-back
but you actually work pretty hard.

482
00:41:31,238 --> 00:41:33,491
It was quite creative
to involve even your enemy

483
00:41:33,574 --> 00:41:35,159
from the Inspection Department.

484
00:41:36,076 --> 00:41:39,747
If you were a little more meticulous,
you may become a pretty effective weapon.

485
00:41:40,956 --> 00:41:43,000
I can't believe that idiot, Tak Juil,

486
00:41:43,083 --> 00:41:47,671
just used and discarded
someone with your exceptional potential.

487
00:41:49,256 --> 00:41:51,091
What are you trying to say to me?

488
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:57,932
Prosecutor Min Seojin.

489
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:01,727
I must say, I admire you.

490
00:42:03,896 --> 00:42:05,981
What if you were to join me on my team?
