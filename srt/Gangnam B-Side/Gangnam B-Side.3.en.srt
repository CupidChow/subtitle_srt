1
00:00:11,886 --> 00:00:14,806
- Please step back.
- You can't take pictures.

2
00:00:14,889 --> 00:00:17,475
-Please step back. No photos.
-Step back, please!

3
00:00:17,559 --> 00:00:18,935
Get back. Ma'am…

4
00:00:20,103 --> 00:00:22,981
-Control the crowd outside.
-Yeah, we just called for backup.

5
00:00:23,064 --> 00:00:24,733
Make sure you get the witnesses' contacts.

6
00:00:24,816 --> 00:00:26,109
So, ma'am, did you get a good look…

7
00:00:43,752 --> 00:00:45,754
You're the
case prosecutor, right?

8
00:00:46,838 --> 00:00:49,007
Is this the main reason
you chose Yoon Gilho?

9
00:00:49,841 --> 00:00:52,469
Because it's just easier to frame
an undocumented man

10
00:00:52,552 --> 00:00:54,179
and close the case, isn't it?

11
00:00:54,262 --> 00:00:56,431
Why don't you tell me who you are first?

12
00:00:56,514 --> 00:00:58,933
It looks like you're the one
meddling with my case.

13
00:00:59,017 --> 00:01:01,311
I'm Captain Kang Dongwoo from Gangnam SIU.

14
00:01:01,394 --> 00:01:03,521
I was escorting a Gangnam
missing persons suspect

15
00:01:03,605 --> 00:01:04,773
when your people shot him.

16
00:01:04,856 --> 00:01:07,108
That's ridiculous.

17
00:01:07,609 --> 00:01:09,819
Why would we intentionally kill
a potential suspect?

18
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:11,988
You saw what those bastards did, though?

19
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:14,991
They were shooting at a dying man!
That's not intentional?

20
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:17,494
Can you prove Captain Ju gave the order?

21
00:01:23,374 --> 00:01:25,460
I don't know whose plan you're following,

22
00:01:26,211 --> 00:01:28,880
but you're helping create
the worst possible outcome.

23
00:01:29,964 --> 00:01:31,758
Keep that in mind, prosecutor.

24
00:01:35,178 --> 00:01:37,180
Get the fuck away from my car.

25
00:01:58,118 --> 00:01:59,410
COMMISSIONER
MOON

26
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:06,126
-Sorry to be calling so late.
-Hey, what's up?

27
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:08,920
They're trying really hard
to push their narrative.

28
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:11,339
It's likely the work of Tak Juil.

29
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:13,758
Do you need some backup?

30
00:02:13,842 --> 00:02:16,136
I'm thinking of putting together
my own team.

31
00:02:16,219 --> 00:02:17,262
What?

32
00:02:17,345 --> 00:02:19,430
Why wasn't I made aware of your order?

33
00:02:19,931 --> 00:02:22,058
If this is how far you'll go
to make your story stick,

34
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:24,978
you should've at least clarified it
before telling me to write it down.

35
00:02:25,061 --> 00:02:28,106
This Yoon Gilho,
maybe he shouldn't be our prime suspect?

36
00:02:28,189 --> 00:02:30,942
Why is it so hard for you
to do as you're told? Come on.

37
00:02:31,025 --> 00:02:34,195
I'm just trying to put out the fire
as requested by you, the chief prosecutor.

38
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:37,991
While you were being indecisive
because you wanted to be so thorough,

39
00:02:38,074 --> 00:02:40,827
another person lost their life
in the heart of Gangnam.

40
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:43,788
Stabbed dozens of times
with a push dagger.

41
00:02:43,872 --> 00:02:44,873
What?

42
00:02:44,956 --> 00:02:48,501
I mean… …we don't have time
for a deep discussion

43
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:51,963
about the real culprit
and all that BS, huh?

44
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:07,914
GANGNAM B-SIDE

45
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:20,134
Hey, you can't go that way.

46
00:04:22,345 --> 00:04:23,346
What do you want?

47
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:26,182
Let CEO Noh Joonseo
know I'm here to see him now.

48
00:04:29,143 --> 00:04:31,145
Hello.

49
00:04:31,896 --> 00:04:33,231
I'm Noh Joonseo.

50
00:04:36,484 --> 00:04:39,070
Why are you all so sober?
You not having fun?

51
00:04:41,239 --> 00:04:42,699
Aren't you drunk yet?

52
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:43,783
You make me!

53
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:47,829
Okay.
In honor of the rebirth of Club HYENA,

54
00:04:48,371 --> 00:04:52,250
everything tonight, all the drinks,
all the food, it's all on me.

55
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:53,835
Okay, let's get it!

56
00:04:53,918 --> 00:04:55,628
Whoo!

57
00:04:57,130 --> 00:05:00,800
- Noh Joonseo!
- Hey!

58
00:05:00,883 --> 00:05:04,804
Noh Joonseo!

59
00:05:04,887 --> 00:05:06,472
Noh Joonseo!

60
00:05:10,393 --> 00:05:11,853
Make some noise!

61
00:05:21,529 --> 00:05:25,158
Excuse my boys
for making you wait here all alone.

62
00:05:25,867 --> 00:05:27,452
It's a little too loud, isn't it?

63
00:05:28,745 --> 00:05:30,288
I've called you several times

64
00:05:30,371 --> 00:05:32,707
as a potential witness
in the Lee Gangsu murder case.

65
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:36,085
I'm sorry, I've been swamped.
I'm a celebrity, after all.

66
00:05:36,878 --> 00:05:39,255
I didn't mean to make you
come all the way over here.

67
00:05:45,136 --> 00:05:47,430
- Here.
- I'm good, thanks.

68
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:52,935
You met with him
on the day he was found dead?

69
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:55,563
Yeah. He hit me up for a drink,
we went out.

70
00:05:55,646 --> 00:05:58,149
He dropped some wisdom on me
about my sit-down.

71
00:05:58,733 --> 00:06:01,819
Um, like, with the prosecution
and all that jazz.

72
00:06:03,821 --> 00:06:05,114
Then I left first.

73
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:07,325
It's all my fault.
I should've taken him home.

74
00:06:07,408 --> 00:06:08,534
Well, I suppose so.

75
00:06:13,748 --> 00:06:17,377
By the way, can you just roll up
in here like that

76
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:19,045
without consulting the top brass?

77
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:22,507
Prosecutor Tak doesn't seem to know
that you're here.

78
00:06:23,925 --> 00:06:26,719
You and Prosecutor Tak,
you two know each other?

79
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:27,804
Of course.

80
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:29,597
Tak is like my brother.

81
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:33,434
And he made it clear that he wanted me
to help you with your investigation.

82
00:06:33,518 --> 00:06:34,852
He says you're his favorite.

83
00:06:35,353 --> 00:06:38,689
Since you came all the way here,
well, I'll help you out.

84
00:06:39,941 --> 00:06:42,360
Unlock your phone and give it to me.

85
00:06:44,612 --> 00:06:46,948
Don't worry, I won't ask you out.

86
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:55,415
Hmm.

87
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:00,795
It's a secret chat app
that people in the business use.

88
00:07:00,878 --> 00:07:03,714
If you set the right bait,
you might find something juicy.

89
00:07:03,798 --> 00:07:05,091
Yoon Gilho's account.

90
00:07:15,726 --> 00:07:18,396
Yoon Gilho's account.
Looks like you know him too?

91
00:07:19,355 --> 00:07:21,232
Well, a little.

92
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:26,154
You seem quite sure he's not dead, though
for someone you only know "a little".

93
00:07:27,071 --> 00:07:28,281
Of course I'm sure.

94
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:32,034
Stray animals always live
way longer than they should.

95
00:07:33,161 --> 00:07:37,582
I'll set up the game my way,
so let's make sure to touch base.

96
00:07:37,665 --> 00:07:39,959
No matter who gets to him first,

97
00:07:40,042 --> 00:07:42,587
I can't wait to wrap this up
and grab a drink with you.

98
00:07:55,224 --> 00:07:56,058
Oh,

99
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:59,979
the last person Lee Gangsu
spoke to on the phone before he died

100
00:08:00,062 --> 00:08:02,231
was saved under the name "Mr. Choi."

101
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:03,983
The call was from a burner phone.

102
00:08:07,111 --> 00:08:08,779
I wondered if you happened to know him?

103
00:08:08,863 --> 00:08:10,323
Mmm.

104
00:08:12,116 --> 00:08:14,118
I'm not sure.

105
00:08:14,202 --> 00:08:17,663
Most people in this business
are CEOs and chairmen.

106
00:08:22,084 --> 00:08:25,421
This is for you. If you flip this,
you're looking at a couple million won.

107
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:26,839
Anyway, call me whenever.

108
00:08:27,924 --> 00:08:30,843
If you need anything else, you know.

109
00:08:40,228 --> 00:08:42,480
K-POP SINGER INVOLVED
IN CHANGWON DANCE GROUP

110
00:08:42,563 --> 00:08:44,690
GANG RAPE CASE
HAS BEEN ACQUITTED

111
00:08:51,989 --> 00:08:53,491
INDICTMENT
DEFENDANT: NOH JOONSEO

112
00:09:04,168 --> 00:09:06,420
TAK JUIL

113
00:09:06,504 --> 00:09:08,047
Yes?

114
00:09:09,507 --> 00:09:10,508
Hi.

115
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:14,428
You can find here
all the details on Noh Joonseo

116
00:09:14,512 --> 00:09:15,888
and Gangsu Entertainment.

117
00:09:15,972 --> 00:09:18,599
I included their close family members,
so it's a lot.

118
00:09:18,683 --> 00:09:21,102
Ma'am, are you sure you want
to review it all by yourself?

119
00:09:21,185 --> 00:09:22,979
Thanks for the hard work.
You can go home now.

120
00:09:24,772 --> 00:09:27,817
Oh! Also, we just got an update that

121
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:31,404
the weapon found at the place Lee Gangsu
was murdered belonged to Yoon Gilho.

122
00:09:32,613 --> 00:09:36,158
Are you sure?
Lee Gangsu was killed by Yoon Gilho too?

123
00:09:39,996 --> 00:09:43,332
Wait, I thought I was
joining the Special Investigations Unit.

124
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:46,335
This is what a real
Special Investigations Unit looks like.

125
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:47,837
Quiet and under the radar.

126
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:54,760
Good God, are you for real?

127
00:09:55,469 --> 00:09:58,180
I was excited to return
to Major Crimes after three years.

128
00:09:59,682 --> 00:10:01,684
Looks like there's no natural light here.

129
00:10:01,809 --> 00:10:02,810
GANGNAM TRADING CO?

130
00:10:02,893 --> 00:10:05,646
By the way,
is that punk Yoon Gilho even alive?

131
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:07,189
There's no proof that he fled,

132
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:09,233
and the search team seemed
to have given up.

133
00:10:10,067 --> 00:10:12,528
What about the dead girl?
You find anything on her?

134
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:15,406
Oh, yeah. Name's Lee Junghwa.

135
00:10:15,489 --> 00:10:17,825
Turns out she was with Kim Jaehee
when she was taken

136
00:10:17,908 --> 00:10:19,910
to the Yeongdeungpo
police station for larceny.

137
00:10:19,994 --> 00:10:23,414
No family, never reported missing,
so I almost couldn't find her.

138
00:10:23,497 --> 00:10:25,333
Prostitution, credit card fraud.

139
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:27,460
Both were trouble makers
after fleeing home.

140
00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:31,047
Investigate their social media
and all that.

141
00:10:32,798 --> 00:10:34,133
What about Yoon Gilho?

142
00:10:36,552 --> 00:10:38,512
Didn't you mention earlier…

143
00:10:38,596 --> 00:10:39,597
YOON GILHO

144
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,725
…that Yoon Gilho's last phone call
was made somewhere in Gangnam?

145
00:10:42,808 --> 00:10:43,643
Yeah.

146
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:47,271
Looks like it's an arcade
located in Nonhyeon-dong.

147
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:50,566
LUCKY ARCADE

148
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:53,944
That arcade over there, do you know
when it was closed down?

149
00:10:54,028 --> 00:10:56,197
LIMITED ACCESS FOR NEW CUSTOMERS

150
00:10:59,241 --> 00:11:02,411
It's probably been about a year or two.

151
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:06,874
They shut down the business
after the owner died.

152
00:11:06,957 --> 00:11:08,417
The owner died? You sure?

153
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:12,755
The owner was the madam of this bar.

154
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:14,256
She worked with young ladies.

155
00:11:15,758 --> 00:11:19,136
The business was successful.
Very successful.

156
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:20,513
GANGNAM TRADING CO.

157
00:11:21,305 --> 00:11:22,473
Gangnam Trading.

158
00:11:22,973 --> 00:11:24,975
Do you really think
they're completely gone

159
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:27,937
just because three years ago
you stirred things up a little?

160
00:11:28,813 --> 00:11:30,606
Hold on, let me show you something.

161
00:11:31,565 --> 00:11:35,236
Do you recognize either of these ladies?
Did they work for her?

162
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:38,030
She seems kind of familiar.

163
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:40,199
But they all looked a lot alike.

164
00:11:41,409 --> 00:11:43,452
MORE MORTGAGE LOAN!

165
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:47,206
-Yeah?
-I told you we would find them soon.

166
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:50,960
I sent you a link. Check it out.

167
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:54,797
Turns out, they're almost like celebrities
in Gangnam's club scene lately.

168
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,507
The three of them seemed close,

169
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:59,677
so I asked around the club where the
blond-haired guy like to hang out.

170
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,054
He quit the day after Junghwa died,

171
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:04,432
claiming he was
traveling abroad or something.

172
00:12:04,932 --> 00:12:08,227
Something's fishy, isn't it?
If we put the pressure on this guy,

173
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:10,062
we might uncover information
about Jaehee or Junghwa.

174
00:12:10,146 --> 00:12:11,439
MDLemoN, 7 MINUTES AGO

175
00:12:11,522 --> 00:12:13,357
Wait, he just posted something. Wait.

176
00:12:14,859 --> 00:12:17,820
Where is this bastard?
This isn't abroad, this is Korea.

177
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:25,554
Hey, man.
Things are serious right now, huh?

178
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:28,933
People are saying Lee Gangsu
was killed by Noh Joonseo.

179
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:32,728
So you take care of yourself, okay?

180
00:13:34,021 --> 00:13:35,731
You know how tough Jaehee is.

181
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:45,491
Give me my money!
Give me my fucking money!

182
00:13:45,574 --> 00:13:47,576
- How's this your fucking money?
- Now, man!

183
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:50,454
Look at her. She's got a lot of nerve.

184
00:13:50,538 --> 00:13:52,623
- Bitch!
- Stay out of this.

185
00:13:52,706 --> 00:13:56,126
- You son of a bitch!
- What are you…Goddamn it.

186
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:59,046
Hey, hey!

187
00:13:59,129 --> 00:14:00,506
Fucking psycho!

188
00:14:00,589 --> 00:14:02,842
- You're okay.
- What's wrong with you?

189
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:04,885
- Come here.
- Hey, hey.

190
00:14:04,969 --> 00:14:08,180
You fucking bastard. Come here!

191
00:14:08,264 --> 00:14:09,807
I'm gonna fucking kill you!

192
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:13,227
RAMONA

193
00:14:20,317 --> 00:14:22,444
You don't have any fear, do you?

194
00:14:24,071 --> 00:14:25,614
You two girls are reckless.

195
00:14:31,412 --> 00:14:32,413
Clean yourself up.

196
00:14:41,422 --> 00:14:43,632
If you have nowhere to go,
you can work here.

197
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:49,054
The money will be a lot better
here than it is out there for you.

198
00:14:50,931 --> 00:14:53,100
Where you take them
after our joint is up to you.

199
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:54,602
I never force anything.

200
00:14:58,606 --> 00:14:59,648
Any rooms?

201
00:15:00,941 --> 00:15:01,942
Let's go.

202
00:15:26,383 --> 00:15:27,384
Hey.

203
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:29,345
Yeah?

204
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:32,932
Come back in two hours. Don't be late.

205
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:38,812
Don't wait for me. Just go grab some food.

206
00:15:40,648 --> 00:15:41,857
I won't run away.

207
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:51,325
-I'll come in if you're late.
-Sure, suit yourself.

208
00:16:19,353 --> 00:16:21,063
Oh, come on. Look at your face.

209
00:16:21,146 --> 00:16:24,149
Cut me some slack.
Assholes were refusing to tip us.

210
00:16:31,532 --> 00:16:32,574
But…

211
00:16:34,743 --> 00:16:36,078
I made them pay up.

212
00:16:48,132 --> 00:16:49,133
Hey.

213
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:57,224
What are you gonna do
with all the money you earn…

214
00:17:01,478 --> 00:17:02,938
working your ass off?

215
00:17:03,897 --> 00:17:06,442
I'll work until I can leave this business.

216
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:18,412
I want to go to a place
somewhere like that

217
00:17:18,495 --> 00:17:20,664
where I can lounge until I die gracefully.

218
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:41,018
At least how I die should be up to me.

219
00:17:46,106 --> 00:17:47,775
Since I have to die anyway…

220
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:51,987
I can at least smoke a cigarette, can't I?

221
00:18:05,667 --> 00:18:07,544
I heard you did that yourself.

222
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:11,673
Could you do one for me too?

223
00:18:12,633 --> 00:18:14,259
To celebrate our new friendship.

224
00:18:18,388 --> 00:18:19,848
Who says I'm your friend?

225
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:21,517
What are you then, my lover?

226
00:18:28,816 --> 00:18:29,817
It's only…

227
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:33,821
because I want to cover this.

228
00:18:36,448 --> 00:18:38,325
Gross, isn't it?

229
00:19:12,734 --> 00:19:14,361
We're back.

230
00:19:24,204 --> 00:19:26,582
Hey! Madam Baek.

231
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:28,542
Madam Baek? Madam Baek!

232
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:34,089
Gilho, call an ambulance.
Call an ambulance, now!

233
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:36,884
Come on, Gilho! Call an ambulance, now!

234
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:40,053
Madam Baek?

235
00:20:02,576 --> 00:20:04,119
Madam Baek is dead.

236
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:06,788
We'll close the business.
We gotta find some other work.

237
00:20:12,002 --> 00:20:13,003
Like what?

238
00:20:13,629 --> 00:20:15,005
A convenience store clerk?

239
00:20:15,088 --> 00:20:16,298
A dishwasher?

240
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:23,347
The other girls will eventually
come back to this business.

241
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:24,514
Bet on it.

242
00:20:24,598 --> 00:20:26,475
Then what the hell do you want me to do?

243
00:20:26,975 --> 00:20:29,811
You don't have anywhere else to go.
We're in the same boat.

244
00:20:32,397 --> 00:20:34,775
Can't we just all keep working together?

245
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:39,529
I trust you to keep us safe, Mr. Yoon.

246
00:20:44,451 --> 00:20:47,829
Wow, so many Internet cafés
with the word "zone" in the name.
Wow, so many Internet cafés
with the word "zone" in the name.

247
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:49,498
- Last one.
- Yeah.

248
00:20:50,457 --> 00:20:52,584
What do you think?
Should I just go in?

249
00:20:53,877 --> 00:20:56,838
So, once we find that guy, we'll find…
What's her name?

250
00:20:56,922 --> 00:20:58,757
Jaehee? It was Jaehee, right?

251
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:00,133
You said we'll find her.

252
00:21:01,593 --> 00:21:03,887
Hey, that's him, right?

253
00:21:03,971 --> 00:21:06,974
Well, that bitch Jaehee is hiding, right?
What are you talking about?

254
00:21:07,057 --> 00:21:09,017
I can't find her if she's not coming out.

255
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:12,688
It's not like you'll handle it if that
bastard Gilho causes a scene again.

256
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:14,523
I will, you fucking moron.

257
00:21:14,606 --> 00:21:15,816
I said I will.

258
00:21:15,899 --> 00:21:18,527
Just hold tight for now
until the heat dies down, though,

259
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:20,279
you hear me, you little fuck?

260
00:21:20,362 --> 00:21:22,823
Whatever, I don't give a fuck. Chill out.

261
00:21:22,906 --> 00:21:25,784
Yun's really pissed off,
and he's going to play a round today.

262
00:21:25,867 --> 00:21:29,037
I'm going to set up the game
and collect a payment directly, all right?

263
00:21:29,788 --> 00:21:31,540
You got it, you bastard?

264
00:21:31,623 --> 00:21:33,083
The fuck did you just…

265
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:38,505
- Do you know him?
- Uh, yeah. He's a total scumbag.

266
00:21:38,588 --> 00:21:42,592
He gives girls drugs in clubs and sends
them to hotels to have sex with clients.

267
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:46,847
I've wanted to catch that asshole
for a while now.

268
00:21:49,016 --> 00:21:51,268
-Follow him. Keep your distance.
-Okay.

269
00:22:03,488 --> 00:22:04,489
What are you doing?

270
00:22:11,747 --> 00:22:12,998
Hey, don't shoot!

271
00:22:13,874 --> 00:22:16,251
Don't shoot, I said, you bastard!

272
00:22:46,615 --> 00:22:49,201
Attention passengers.
The doors are now closing.

273
00:22:49,284 --> 00:22:50,410
Please stand clear.

274
00:22:59,753 --> 00:23:02,214
JJOONI BOY JOONSEO,
THANKS FOR COMING TO THIS WORLD

275
00:23:15,685 --> 00:23:17,896
Yeah, Ms. Ryu.

276
00:23:18,772 --> 00:23:20,565
So, I just visited the NFS,

277
00:23:20,649 --> 00:23:23,151
and I was told that the DNA
found on Lee Junghwa's body

278
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:25,404
matched what was found on the knife.

279
00:23:25,487 --> 00:23:27,823
We don't know for sure
if it's Yoon Gilho's yet.

280
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:30,951
So we don't know for sure?

281
00:23:31,034 --> 00:23:34,579
No. Also, we got a visit from her aunt.

282
00:23:34,663 --> 00:23:36,081
Lee Junghwa's?

283
00:23:36,957 --> 00:23:38,959
Lee Junghwa has an aunt?

284
00:23:39,042 --> 00:23:42,462
Yes. Seems like she was her only family.

285
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:45,382
But she refused to take the body.

286
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:50,470
I feel so bad for that little girl.
She doesn't even get a proper funeral.

287
00:23:50,554 --> 00:23:53,390
-Let's talk some more tomorrow.
-Okay. Bye.

288
00:23:53,473 --> 00:23:56,393
Ladies and gentlemen,
may I have your attention…

289
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:10,031
Excuse me, miss.

290
00:24:12,534 --> 00:24:13,743
Do you know Lee Junghwa?

291
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:20,667
The doors are closing.

292
00:24:55,243 --> 00:24:56,453
Hey, what did you find out?

293
00:24:56,536 --> 00:24:58,038
I went over the
business cards you sent me

294
00:24:58,121 --> 00:25:00,415
but they're just adult entertainment bars
in Gangnam.

295
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:03,210
In fact, Gangnam Trading Company
doesn't even have a sign anymore.

296
00:25:03,293 --> 00:25:04,377
It's a regular office now.

297
00:25:05,128 --> 00:25:07,881
But I looked into
that whole building anyway, just in case.

298
00:25:07,964 --> 00:25:08,965
Yeah?

299
00:25:09,799 --> 00:25:12,677
I'll send you the address.
Check it out now.

300
00:25:12,761 --> 00:25:13,637
Okay.

301
00:25:14,137 --> 00:25:16,431
This is just…
…I can't believe this.

302
00:25:19,726 --> 00:25:22,020
All right.
I'm busy now, so let's talk later.

303
00:25:22,103 --> 00:25:25,857
No, wait. I'm trying to tell you
the building is one we know quite well.

304
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:28,568
I'm looking at it right now.

305
00:25:34,199 --> 00:25:37,452
Well, isn't that just
a fucking hole in the boat.

306
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:01,434
Jesus.

307
00:26:23,957 --> 00:26:25,125
It's a hostess bar.

308
00:26:57,282 --> 00:26:59,701
These assholes still haven't
learned their lesson.

309
00:27:01,828 --> 00:27:03,079
- Man…
- Hey!

310
00:27:05,957 --> 00:27:07,250
Damn, you scared me.

311
00:27:37,864 --> 00:27:39,866
Jesus, what a bunch of fucking clowns.

312
00:27:53,963 --> 00:27:55,465
Unbelievable.

313
00:27:55,548 --> 00:27:57,842
Seriously, you're still doing this,
Jangho?

314
00:27:57,926 --> 00:28:00,220
No, it wasn't me.
It wasn't me. I-I… It wasn't me.

315
00:28:00,303 --> 00:28:01,513
You're losing your touch.

316
00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:05,767
Hey, Seo Jisu.

317
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:09,521
Is this how you greet me?
Go easy on me, all right?

318
00:28:51,062 --> 00:28:52,063
What the…

319
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:55,483
Who the fuck are you, man?
Get out of here, you little…

320
00:28:57,861 --> 00:29:00,280
You know
where Jaehee is, don't you?

321
00:29:00,363 --> 00:29:02,991
I don't know,
I don't know!

322
00:29:03,867 --> 00:29:05,618
I don't fucking know.

323
00:29:09,873 --> 00:29:11,124
Goddamn it.

324
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:15,170
This fucker…

325
00:29:22,427 --> 00:29:24,721
Hey, girls. Hey, wake up.

326
00:29:26,931 --> 00:29:27,932
Shit.

327
00:29:39,486 --> 00:29:40,695
Shit.

328
00:29:41,654 --> 00:29:42,906
What was that sound?

329
00:29:57,045 --> 00:29:58,421
Put your hands up and turn around.

330
00:29:58,505 --> 00:30:00,340
Put your hands up and turn around!

331
00:30:04,677 --> 00:30:07,764
Fuck, it's you again.

332
00:30:11,684 --> 00:30:12,727
Dongwoo.

333
00:30:13,311 --> 00:30:15,355
Fucking Kang Dongwoo.

334
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:21,820
Just get out of here, you piece of shit,
you fucking parasite!

335
00:30:21,903 --> 00:30:24,197
Come on, let go. Let go of me! It hurts!

336
00:30:25,657 --> 00:30:27,450
All right. Keep alert, yeah?

337
00:30:27,534 --> 00:30:28,535
Yes, sir.

338
00:30:28,618 --> 00:30:29,911
This is fucking crazy.

339
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:37,210
You know about Gangnam Trading Company.

340
00:30:37,293 --> 00:30:39,003
What's your connection to them?

341
00:30:39,087 --> 00:30:41,840
It is within my rights to remain silent.

342
00:30:41,923 --> 00:30:44,634
Why don't you just
do the paperwork and move on?

343
00:30:44,717 --> 00:30:45,885
Who's giving you the orders?

344
00:30:48,221 --> 00:30:51,266
Who told you to kill Yoon Gilho
and frame him for killing Lee Junghwa?

345
00:30:51,349 --> 00:30:54,102
You don't have the brains
to pull that off. Who gave the order?

346
00:30:55,937 --> 00:30:57,689
Did you kill Lee Junghwa?

347
00:31:00,692 --> 00:31:01,901
Kim Jaehee too?

348
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:07,073
Hey, we're done here, okay?
Put me in detention now.

349
00:31:07,156 --> 00:31:08,366
You motherfucker!

350
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:10,034
You fucking bastard!

351
00:31:12,078 --> 00:31:13,538
You son of a bitch. Answer me.

352
00:31:13,621 --> 00:31:15,164
Who's calling the shots?

353
00:31:15,832 --> 00:31:17,292
Stop! Let go of me!

354
00:31:17,375 --> 00:31:18,751
-Let him go, asshole.
-Hold him!

355
00:31:18,835 --> 00:31:22,005
I'm not done with you, you bastard!
Let go of me, you fucking bastard, let go!

356
00:31:22,088 --> 00:31:24,299
Good Lord, this moron.

357
00:31:24,382 --> 00:31:27,468
The hell kind of deputy inspector
sells drugs so openly?

358
00:31:27,552 --> 00:31:29,387
I want him fired, no loose ends.

359
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:31,222
Geez.

360
00:31:32,056 --> 00:31:35,393
-Sir, were you unaware of this?
-What?

361
00:31:35,476 --> 00:31:37,854
I'm asking if it's okay
to discard him like that.

362
00:31:38,563 --> 00:31:40,857
He's the person who would
undoubtedly retaliate against us.

363
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:42,483
That's why I'm assigning you this task

364
00:31:42,567 --> 00:31:45,862
to make sure his hands are tied
so he can't do anything to us later.

365
00:31:45,945 --> 00:31:48,573
I wish you'd quit looking
for that person of interest.

366
00:31:48,656 --> 00:31:52,911
I need you to get your focus back on
your primary responsibilities, understand?

367
00:31:52,994 --> 00:31:55,079
For crying out loud…

368
00:31:55,788 --> 00:31:58,374
Why is everyone like this?

369
00:32:23,858 --> 00:32:27,195
The indictment process won't
be hindered with such strong evidence.

370
00:32:28,029 --> 00:32:30,698
I recommend you just admit the charges
to get your sentence reduced--

371
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:32,659
Is that what he's telling me to do?

372
00:32:32,742 --> 00:32:34,118
What?

373
00:32:34,744 --> 00:32:36,371
You know, don't you?

374
00:32:36,454 --> 00:32:38,957
I never make a move without his orders.

375
00:32:42,919 --> 00:32:45,213
- Captain Ju, stop--
- Prosecutor Min,

376
00:32:45,838 --> 00:32:47,507
could you give my family a call?

377
00:32:48,508 --> 00:32:50,051
My wife must be worried sick.

378
00:32:50,134 --> 00:32:54,555
The wardens at this detention center…
Not really so generous.

379
00:32:54,639 --> 00:32:57,475
You want me to call the number
we have for your wife?

380
00:32:58,476 --> 00:33:01,396
She uses a different phone number
to contact me.

381
00:33:01,479 --> 00:33:03,523
Maybe you could you write it down?

382
00:33:10,697 --> 00:33:12,198
010

383
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:16,494
7251

384
00:33:17,328 --> 00:33:18,997
5611.

385
00:33:20,581 --> 00:33:22,542
Noh Joonseo.

386
00:33:25,837 --> 00:33:28,423
Please tell him I miss him a lot,
won't you?

387
00:33:29,173 --> 00:33:33,344
And that there's so much I'm dying to say,
but I'll hold it in for now.

388
00:33:42,645 --> 00:33:43,896
We're done.

389
00:33:56,617 --> 00:33:58,369
MR. TAK IS QUITTING

390
00:34:00,329 --> 00:34:01,748
I NEED TO BRING THIS GIFT TO MY SON

391
00:34:01,831 --> 00:34:03,666
YOU WON'T LET ME DIE ALONE,
WILL YOU, MR. NOH?

392
00:34:06,377 --> 00:34:07,378
Goddamn it.

393
00:34:08,337 --> 00:34:09,964
Psyche, where are you?

394
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:11,132
Holy fuck.

395
00:34:11,674 --> 00:34:14,010
Hey! Psyche!

396
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:16,512
PSYCHE

397
00:34:17,722 --> 00:34:19,849
I told you not to call me
while I'm shooting, idiot.

398
00:34:19,932 --> 00:34:24,020
- Joonseo, this bastard was actually alive.
- Hey, Psyche. Where the hell…

399
00:34:24,103 --> 00:34:25,605
…is Noh Joonseo, you motherfucker?

400
00:34:25,688 --> 00:34:27,648
- What do we do now?
- Noh Joonseo!

401
00:34:30,109 --> 00:34:33,571
Mr. Yoon! Wow, you're not dead.

402
00:34:33,654 --> 00:34:35,156
Where's Noh Joonseo?

403
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:37,617
What's up? You still looking for
Kim Jaehee?

404
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:39,702
That bitch reached out to us
and asked us for money.

405
00:34:39,786 --> 00:34:42,038
-Cut the bullshit. Where is Noh Joonseo?
-Oh, my God.

406
00:34:42,121 --> 00:34:45,374
Hold on, are wanted criminals allowed
to fucking roam around freely like this?

407
00:34:45,458 --> 00:34:47,293
Geez, wait, wait! Wait, hold on.

408
00:34:48,586 --> 00:34:50,338
You'll hear from Joonseo soon, man.

409
00:34:50,421 --> 00:34:51,672
Jaehee'll be there too.

410
00:34:52,173 --> 00:34:53,716
We should have a party.

411
00:34:54,675 --> 00:34:57,178
- Excuse me. We've responding to a report.
- Cops!

412
00:34:59,597 --> 00:35:01,641
- Over here. It's him.
- That guy. The black jacket.

413
00:35:01,724 --> 00:35:03,851
- Excuse me? Excuse me!
- It's him.

414
00:35:18,574 --> 00:35:19,659
Min Seojin speaking.

415
00:35:19,742 --> 00:35:21,702
I haven't heard from my wife yet.

416
00:35:22,745 --> 00:35:24,163
Did you talk to her?

417
00:35:24,747 --> 00:35:26,082
No, not yet.

418
00:35:28,042 --> 00:35:29,418
Forget about my wife.

419
00:35:32,505 --> 00:35:34,048
Actually, Prosecutor Min,

420
00:35:35,424 --> 00:35:37,260
I'd like to consult with you after all.

421
00:35:38,177 --> 00:35:40,930
Just the two of us.
Without Prosecutor Tak.

422
00:35:44,225 --> 00:35:45,893
GANGNAM TRADING CO.?
TRANSPORTATION, FINANCE

423
00:35:50,731 --> 00:35:51,732
PROSECUTOR MIN SEOJIN

424
00:35:51,816 --> 00:35:52,817
Damn it.

425
00:35:57,655 --> 00:36:00,199
You should answer your phone.
It could've been something important.

426
00:36:00,283 --> 00:36:01,367
What brings you here?

427
00:36:02,785 --> 00:36:07,206
Captain Ju is going to turn himself in.
I'm meeting him tomorrow morning.

428
00:36:08,207 --> 00:36:09,208
So?

429
00:36:12,336 --> 00:36:15,590
I know you have been on bad terms
for three years.

430
00:36:15,673 --> 00:36:17,216
Share everything you know with me.

431
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:21,262
I'll convince Captain Ju, then we'll be
able to wrap this all up nice and quick.

432
00:36:21,345 --> 00:36:23,055
How can I trust you?

433
00:36:23,139 --> 00:36:26,350
This whole thing is rigged by Prosecutor
Tak. It's a game you're playing.

434
00:36:26,434 --> 00:36:28,978
If that were the case,
I never would have come here.

435
00:36:29,061 --> 00:36:31,314
What would I gain by disclosing
this information to you?

436
00:36:31,397 --> 00:36:34,942
How would I know what
Prosecutor Tak asked you to do?

437
00:36:35,735 --> 00:36:38,613
I'm the only one who can wrap this up now.

438
00:36:47,330 --> 00:36:48,789
I saw a girl.

439
00:36:48,873 --> 00:36:51,042
She was burning incense
on the bench at the platform

440
00:36:51,125 --> 00:36:53,085
where Lee Junghwa's body was found.

441
00:36:53,169 --> 00:36:55,922
As soon as she heard
the name "Lee Junghwa," she ran away.

442
00:36:59,967 --> 00:37:01,010
Was it her?

443
00:37:05,056 --> 00:37:07,516
-I figured you knew her.
-Oh, for fuck's sake!

444
00:37:10,728 --> 00:37:11,729
Good God.

445
00:37:12,271 --> 00:37:13,564
I need you to come clean.

446
00:37:14,232 --> 00:37:16,734
What evidence do you possess
that I'm not aware of?

447
00:37:17,985 --> 00:37:22,573
Why were you with Yoon Gilho that night
and why are you so fixated on him now?

448
00:37:24,575 --> 00:37:26,494
This can't wait. I need to know.

449
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:42,093
Kim Jaehee.

450
00:37:43,302 --> 00:37:46,222
She's one of the girls Yoon Gilho
was working with, like Lee Junghwa.

451
00:37:47,265 --> 00:37:49,183
She vanished before Lee Junghwa's murder.

452
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:53,646
She's my daughter's best friend.

453
00:37:58,651 --> 00:38:02,238
I need to find her to save my daughter.

454
00:38:03,823 --> 00:38:05,449
Does that answer your question?

455
00:38:10,621 --> 00:38:13,082
NOH JOONSEO

456
00:38:14,959 --> 00:38:17,628
Come to the club.
I've got a gift for you.

457
00:38:17,712 --> 00:38:19,046
What?

458
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:22,174
Guess what?
I found our stray animal first.

459
00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:25,720
Yoon Gilho? How did you find him?

460
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:30,391
I set the right kind of bait.
I know a bitch he's willing to die for.

461
00:38:30,474 --> 00:38:31,767
Do you mean…

462
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:34,103
Kim Jaehee?

463
00:38:35,062 --> 00:38:36,731
What the hell are you up to this time?

464
00:38:36,814 --> 00:38:40,776
Captain Ju told the truth. I won't
let it slide this time so get ready.

465
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:43,696
Captain Ju told you nothing.
I know you haven't even met with him yet.

466
00:38:44,405 --> 00:38:46,449
-You're supposed to meet tomorrow, right?
-What?

467
00:38:49,201 --> 00:38:51,287
It's too bad though, Miss Prosecutor.

468
00:38:52,747 --> 00:38:55,124
Your morning visit will be canceled.

469
00:38:55,207 --> 00:38:56,417
Who is it?

470
00:39:00,504 --> 00:39:03,257
Excuse me. Are you asleep?

471
00:39:05,968 --> 00:39:07,636
Just go to sleep.

472
00:39:08,763 --> 00:39:10,598
Don't you remember me, Detective?

473
00:39:11,432 --> 00:39:13,392
Get lost, asshole.

474
00:39:15,644 --> 00:39:18,606
What good could possibly
come out of his mouth?

475
00:39:18,689 --> 00:39:22,276
The detention center must be
full of people who want him dead anyway.

476
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:24,278
You knocked my front tooth out
at the hostess bar

477
00:39:24,362 --> 00:39:26,405
in Nonhyeon-dong last year,
remember? Look.

478
00:39:26,489 --> 00:39:29,075
Go ahead, turn around, Detective. You see?

479
00:39:29,158 --> 00:39:31,952
I'm just trying my best to help you out.

480
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:35,039
Just tell me
what you've got planned.

481
00:39:35,915 --> 00:39:37,166
Come by midnight.

482
00:39:37,249 --> 00:39:40,711
You show up late, I'll turn her corpse
over to the cops. Okay?

483
00:39:46,092 --> 00:39:49,720
You should've at least gotten me
a new tooth, you fucking bastard.

484
00:40:02,483 --> 00:40:04,568
LUCKY ARCADE

485
00:40:08,697 --> 00:40:09,698
PSYCHE

486
00:40:09,782 --> 00:40:12,493
I GOT JENNY

487
00:40:12,576 --> 00:40:13,702
COME TO HYENA BY MIDNIGHT

488
00:40:18,541 --> 00:40:21,752
DON'T BE LATE
IF YOU'RE EVEN A MINUTE LATE,

489
00:40:21,836 --> 00:40:23,504
HER PRETTY FACE
WILL GET ALL CUT UP

490
00:40:27,341 --> 00:40:29,260
JUST LIKE LEE JUNGHWA

491
00:40:33,973 --> 00:40:37,101
We gotta stop them, no matter what.
These people are ruthless.

492
00:40:37,184 --> 00:40:39,228
Yoon Gilho is a dead man
if he shows up there.

493
00:40:40,563 --> 00:40:43,482
Noh Joonseo gave me access
to Yoon Gilho's chat account.

494
00:40:43,983 --> 00:40:46,652
So you were the one
who had information to share.

495
00:40:46,735 --> 00:40:48,612
I admit I made a mistake.

496
00:40:48,696 --> 00:40:50,072
You don't have to trust me,

497
00:40:50,156 --> 00:40:52,283
but we need to find
the real killer and arrest him.

498
00:40:52,783 --> 00:40:54,118
Whether or not it's Gilho.

499
00:40:56,078 --> 00:41:00,332
Are you saying we can reach
Yoon Gilho from a chat app?

500
00:41:06,881 --> 00:41:09,258
- Wow, look at this.
- Welcome, gentlemen.

501
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:12,553
Damn, you're fucking working
so hard lately, Jjooni.

502
00:41:12,636 --> 00:41:14,889
What's the big deal? What do you want
to show us that's so fun?

503
00:41:14,972 --> 00:41:17,308
Listen. If this is no fun,
I'm out of here. All right?

504
00:41:17,391 --> 00:41:18,893
What is it? Come on, show me.

505
00:41:21,979 --> 00:41:24,356
Gentlemen, the girl
you've been missing so dearly.

506
00:41:25,566 --> 00:41:26,984
I present Jenny.

507
00:41:31,655 --> 00:41:35,075
Holy shit. You found her?

508
00:41:35,159 --> 00:41:37,453
- When, how?
- Jesus Christ.

509
00:41:38,037 --> 00:41:39,705
It's gonna be a fucking fun night.

510
00:41:41,123 --> 00:41:45,211
Jjooni is so fucking good
at his job, dude, seriously.

511
00:41:45,294 --> 00:41:47,338
For real, dude?
Where did you find her?

512
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:51,300
Tonight is gonna be fucking amazing!

513
00:41:51,383 --> 00:41:53,052
I can't believe it's really Jenny.

514
