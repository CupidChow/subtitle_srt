1
00:00:27,902 --> 00:00:29,070
Stand here.

2
00:00:32,824 --> 00:00:34,159
Phones, here.

3
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:39,372
What are you doing?

4
00:00:41,082 --> 00:00:42,167
You're good.

5
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:43,501
Follow me.

6
00:00:44,335 --> 00:00:45,587
Go ahead.

7
00:00:49,966 --> 00:00:51,551
And your purse.

8
00:00:53,928 --> 00:00:55,180
What's wrong?

9
00:00:59,267 --> 00:01:00,643
Is this not allowed?

10
00:01:00,727 --> 00:01:03,229
'Cause I won't survive
five minutes without this.

11
00:01:03,313 --> 00:01:04,439
Hey…

12
00:01:05,231 --> 00:01:07,233
That will rot your teeth out.

13
00:01:07,817 --> 00:01:09,527
Be careful, yeah?

14
00:01:09,611 --> 00:01:10,612
Let her in.

15
00:01:10,695 --> 00:01:12,697
Let's go, let's go. This will be fun.

16
00:01:12,781 --> 00:01:15,200
- Is this really a party room?
- What?

17
00:01:15,283 --> 00:01:17,243
-What is this place?
-What's this? There's nothing here.

18
00:01:18,495 --> 00:01:20,330
HAE IL

19
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:45,105
How's Gilho?

20
00:01:45,188 --> 00:01:48,441
Um, well, he's out like a light.
Should we, uh,

21
00:01:49,317 --> 00:01:51,069
take care of him when we're ready?

22
00:01:51,152 --> 00:01:52,153
Hey…

23
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,199
I don't want anybody to touch Gilho.

24
00:01:56,282 --> 00:01:59,536
Remember that he belongs to me.
Just keep an eye on him.

25
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:00,662
Yes, sir.

26
00:02:03,039 --> 00:02:04,749
Hey, let's move him for now.

27
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:06,000
All right.

28
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,510
-The fuck? Did he escape?
-Shit.

29
00:02:15,593 --> 00:02:16,761
Motherfucker!

30
00:02:21,683 --> 00:02:22,684
What?

31
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,107
God, you fucking idiots.

32
00:02:30,441 --> 00:02:32,318
It was for all our sakes, Prosecutor.

33
00:02:33,069 --> 00:02:35,738
You said you wanted to be
part of the entire plan.

34
00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:45,123
I told you.

35
00:02:46,124 --> 00:02:48,585
No matter what,
you'll always be my underling.

36
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:51,754
Good to see you again.

37
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:01,431
All right. Let's get started.

38
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:03,641
-Here we go.
-Prosecutor Min?

39
00:03:12,734 --> 00:03:16,321
It's a foolproof contract, reviewed
by an attorney and a working prosecutor.

40
00:03:20,408 --> 00:03:21,576
Yeah.

41
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:23,661
Seriously, what is this place?

42
00:03:25,955 --> 00:03:28,875
You did work out the side effects
of the meds, though, right?

43
00:03:29,542 --> 00:03:31,294
I mean, not that I don't trust you.

44
00:03:34,297 --> 00:03:36,966
Well, why don't you see for yourself?

45
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:47,977
-Huh?
-What?

46
00:03:52,315 --> 00:03:55,401
Next month we're releasing
Leon and Leon Plus.

47
00:03:57,278 --> 00:03:59,822
They will turn the market
completely upside down.

48
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:02,533
Begin.

49
00:04:11,042 --> 00:04:14,128
That one syringe
contains ten doses of Leon.

50
00:04:14,837 --> 00:04:18,675
These girls haven't developed, uh,
any tolerance yet,

51
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:22,053
so you'll get to see
the full effect of Leon.

52
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:23,721
Watch.

53
00:04:27,558 --> 00:04:28,726
No, I don't want to!

54
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:31,145
Get off!

55
00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:33,398
No!

56
00:04:33,481 --> 00:04:34,607
No, don't!

57
00:04:44,742 --> 00:04:46,744
You're injecting an entire syringe
into her?

58
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:49,163
Isn't that lethal?

59
00:04:50,248 --> 00:04:53,126
We are sure
this will work, right?

60
00:04:53,876 --> 00:04:56,004
That's why we made the Leon Plus.

61
00:05:02,093 --> 00:05:04,387
Listen, you wanna get rich or not?

62
00:05:41,424 --> 00:05:44,677
GANGNAM B-SIDE

63
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:02,862
So that's the detox med, right?

64
00:06:02,945 --> 00:06:03,946
Leon Plus?

65
00:06:16,584 --> 00:06:19,087
- Oh. Oh!
- Wait. Wait, it's working!

66
00:06:20,963 --> 00:06:21,964
It works. Yeah!

67
00:06:24,717 --> 00:06:26,844
Yes! Well done!

68
00:06:26,928 --> 00:06:28,763
Mr. Choi.
You're the only one I believe in.

69
00:06:29,597 --> 00:06:31,432
And we were worried.

70
00:06:31,516 --> 00:06:32,934
Bravo!

71
00:06:39,816 --> 00:06:42,318
- What's wrong with her?
- What's going on?

72
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:45,696
- Hey. What's going on?
- What's happening?

73
00:06:47,198 --> 00:06:48,991
Is she gonna be all right?

74
00:06:50,618 --> 00:06:51,494
Huh?

75
00:06:51,577 --> 00:06:52,829
What is this?

76
00:07:27,572 --> 00:07:29,323
Hey.

77
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:39,750
Hey, are you okay?

78
00:07:39,834 --> 00:07:40,835
Is that blood?

79
00:07:40,918 --> 00:07:43,337
What's happening?
What's going on? Fuck.

80
00:07:43,421 --> 00:07:45,089
I don't think she's breathing.

81
00:07:45,173 --> 00:07:47,383
Come on, people.
Hold it together. All right?

82
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:48,676
Hey!

83
00:07:50,845 --> 00:07:52,430
Aren't you a doctor? She's dying!

84
00:07:52,513 --> 00:07:54,348
Do something!

85
00:08:04,525 --> 00:08:05,776
No!

86
00:08:11,782 --> 00:08:15,328
Shit! That shit is happening again!

87
00:08:15,411 --> 00:08:18,706
I thought you told all of us these side
effects weren't going to happen again!

88
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:23,211
Reactions depend on the individual,

89
00:08:23,294 --> 00:08:25,046
just like all drugs.

90
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:27,465
You know what I'm saying.

91
00:08:27,548 --> 00:08:30,676
You promised it was ready.
Making us go back and forth like that.

92
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:34,305
We didn't dump a ton of money
into this med to see that shit.

93
00:08:47,109 --> 00:08:48,569
You keep complaining.

94
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,244
Just watch the rest of the trial.

95
00:08:58,746 --> 00:09:00,915
He's right…

96
00:09:00,998 --> 00:09:05,253
These types of trials are considered
successful if you do any better than 50%.

97
00:09:05,336 --> 00:09:08,130
We all know that.

98
00:09:13,135 --> 00:09:14,428
Carry on.

99
00:09:15,763 --> 00:09:17,682
No!

100
00:09:17,765 --> 00:09:20,059
No. Get off me!

101
00:09:20,977 --> 00:09:22,520
Hey!

102
00:09:23,354 --> 00:09:25,189
I said get off me!

103
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:32,697
Why don't we finish
the contract signing first?

104
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:35,950
Once the products are released
across the country next month,

105
00:09:36,033 --> 00:09:40,329
everyone here will make enough money
to retire like kings and queens, right?

106
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:42,582
And that was the point
of this whole project.

107
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:50,798
Hold on.

108
00:10:10,026 --> 00:10:12,445
- Did you find your daughter?
- Where are you?

109
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:16,282
I'm at some kind of…
…drug company.

110
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:18,159
Wait a minute. You're here?

111
00:10:18,242 --> 00:10:20,536
"Here"? Where are you now?

112
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:26,250
Hey, listen. Choi Hakgu tested the meds
on the girls.

113
00:10:26,334 --> 00:10:30,338
And Jaehee took a video of it.
Yeseo's in danger right now.

114
00:10:51,359 --> 00:10:53,069
Now, please, go ahead and sign,

115
00:10:54,528 --> 00:10:59,742
so that fate will bind us all
in an official capacity.

116
00:11:05,748 --> 00:11:07,249
Hey!

117
00:11:20,304 --> 00:11:22,556
- Help me!
- Go, now.

118
00:11:24,934 --> 00:11:26,936
Come on! Hurry up and untie this!

119
00:11:29,647 --> 00:11:31,399
Go! Go, man!

120
00:11:31,482 --> 00:11:33,109
Get the fuck out of here!

121
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:34,652
Get that motherfucker!

122
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:47,498
Ah, fuck me. Is this some kind of joke?

123
00:11:47,581 --> 00:11:49,250
Shit.

124
00:11:49,834 --> 00:11:54,004
Why is it 51 for you
and 49 for the rest of us combined?

125
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:59,593
I told you that you would only get
the goddamn permits

126
00:11:59,677 --> 00:12:01,679
if you split it nicely, didn't I?

127
00:12:05,808 --> 00:12:06,892
Look, everyone.

128
00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:10,354
We're all putting our lives on the line

129
00:12:10,438 --> 00:12:12,523
by diving into this crazy,
fucked-up business,

130
00:12:12,606 --> 00:12:15,109
so shouldn't we be getting,
oh, I don't know,

131
00:12:15,192 --> 00:12:17,695
more than chump change in return?

132
00:12:17,778 --> 00:12:18,863
Don't you think?

133
00:12:21,198 --> 00:12:22,992
Why, hello, Detective.

134
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:26,370
You must be here to save your daughter.

135
00:12:26,454 --> 00:12:28,038
Yeseo. Where is she?

136
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:31,292
Why don't you just go?

137
00:12:32,001 --> 00:12:34,420
Your daughter doesn't seem
to care about her father anyway.

138
00:12:34,503 --> 00:12:36,046
Where is Yeseo?

139
00:12:42,386 --> 00:12:47,224
If you want to see her so bad,
let's see if you can climb these stairs.

140
00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:50,352
You might want to see this.

141
00:13:10,414 --> 00:13:12,041
What now? Shit.

142
00:13:12,124 --> 00:13:15,044
Is this what
you've been looking for so desperately?

143
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:16,295
Kim Jaehee's video!

144
00:13:17,254 --> 00:13:20,007
Do you not need this anymore,
you bastards?

145
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:21,175
Huh?

146
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:25,137
What's he talking about? What video?

147
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:28,265
Mr. Choi, who is he? Huh?

148
00:13:30,976 --> 00:13:33,938
Listen, don't mind him.
Let's just keep going.

149
00:13:34,021 --> 00:13:36,482
Oh, no, no, no.

150
00:13:37,942 --> 00:13:40,486
We should know exactly
what's happening out there.

151
00:13:41,403 --> 00:13:43,113
It's our right.

152
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:50,454
How dare you threaten us, motherfucker.

153
00:13:51,413 --> 00:13:53,290
So, you won't be needing this?

154
00:13:55,793 --> 00:13:56,961

- Goddamn it.
- What's happening?

159
00:14:16,772 --> 00:14:17,815
Move.

160
00:14:17,898 --> 00:14:19,525
I said move, you fuck.

161
00:14:28,492 --> 00:14:30,035
Give me my phone.

00:14:52,975 --> 00:14:54,727
Does it mean nothing to you?

173
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:57,354
Get his ass. Come on.

174
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:04,236

-I said move!
-Listen here, Mr. Choi.

179
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:18,626
Could we get an explanation?

180
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:27,343
What's to explain?

181
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:31,013
All of you knew it.

182
00:15:35,017 --> 00:15:36,435
Rip the limbs off that little rat

183
00:15:36,518 --> 00:15:38,938
if that's what it takes
to get that video back.

184
00:15:39,688 --> 00:15:41,649
And let me know
when the real contract's ready.

185
00:15:41,732 --> 00:15:43,233
I don't care about the others.

186
00:15:43,317 --> 00:15:44,777
Actually, take all their names out.

187
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:48,113
You and me, end of story. We go 50-50.

188
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:50,616
If that's not the deal,
you can't launch anything.

189
00:15:50,699 --> 00:15:52,409
You know that, right?

190
00:15:55,829 --> 00:15:56,956
Where are you going?

191
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:58,374
You can't walk away.

192
00:15:58,457 --> 00:16:00,709
Hello, you're in this video too.
You can't just walk out of this!

193
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:03,045
It's okay.
Mr. Choi will handle everything.

194
00:16:03,128 --> 00:16:04,838
Isn't that right, Prosecutor Min?

195
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:09,259
You fuckers. Jesus.

196
00:16:09,343 --> 00:16:10,678
Tak Juil.

197
00:16:13,138 --> 00:16:14,890
What?

198
00:16:17,601 --> 00:16:19,561
Shit, you've got to be kidding me.

199
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:23,482
How…

200
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:27,861
dare you talk to me like that.

201
00:16:27,945 --> 00:16:29,863
Secretary Tak!

202
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:42,251
Oh, my God.

203
00:16:44,628 --> 00:16:45,629
Oh, my…

204
00:16:47,464 --> 00:16:49,550
If you don't like
the terms and conditions,

205
00:16:50,217 --> 00:16:51,510
speak your piece.

206
00:16:54,638 --> 00:16:55,723
Get that bastard!

207
00:17:14,366 --> 00:17:15,951
Oh, God, I don't feel well.

208
00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:39,558
Motherfucker!

209
00:18:06,293 --> 00:18:08,045
To the new Chief Prosecutor.

210
00:18:13,967 --> 00:18:15,594
A toast to you. Cheers.

211
00:18:35,614 --> 00:18:37,825
Get him! Upstairs!

212
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:43,413
Just go. Hurry.

213
00:18:43,497 --> 00:18:44,540
You go ahead.

214
00:18:45,582 --> 00:18:46,667
What?

215
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:49,294
FIRE SHUTTER CONTROLLER

216
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:53,549
What are you doing?

217
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:54,591
I mean it. Go!

218
00:18:54,675 --> 00:18:56,093
What the hell are you trying to do here?

219
00:18:56,176 --> 00:18:58,137
Both of us don't need to die!

220
00:18:58,220 --> 00:18:59,388
Just go!

221
00:19:05,227 --> 00:19:07,729
She's your daughter. Protect her.

222
00:19:10,732 --> 00:19:12,234
You bastard!

223
00:19:28,709 --> 00:19:30,294
Drink up. It's a good day.

224
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:47,144
Hey, Minseok.

225
00:19:48,312 --> 00:19:49,771
It's just you and me again.

226
00:19:51,565 --> 00:19:53,150
You son of a bitch.

227
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:59,072
I told you not to call me that.

228
00:20:28,268 --> 00:20:30,729
Bring in the remaining girl.

229
00:20:38,111 --> 00:20:39,988
Yeseo! Kang Yeseo!

230
00:20:41,156 --> 00:20:42,908
You fucking bastard!

231
00:20:42,991 --> 00:20:44,785
I fed you,
kept a fucking roof over your head

232
00:20:44,868 --> 00:20:46,036
and this is how you repay me?

233
00:20:46,119 --> 00:20:47,412
Ungrateful fuck!

234
00:21:24,866 --> 00:21:25,867
Come here.

235
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:29,871
It's okay.

236
00:21:31,206 --> 00:21:32,374
Come and sit here.

237
00:21:47,222 --> 00:21:48,307
You motherfucker.

238
00:21:51,768 --> 00:21:53,061
Minseok.

239
00:22:03,488 --> 00:22:05,365
So long, motherfucker.

240
00:22:10,037 --> 00:22:11,121
You bastard.

241
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:13,915
I'm gonna gouge your fucking eye out.

242
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:18,378
Ah, shit.

243
00:22:21,465 --> 00:22:23,342
Let go, motherfucker.

244
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:29,181
-Fuck off, you son of a bitch.
-Fuck you!

245
00:22:37,189 --> 00:22:39,358
You motherfucker!

246
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:08,637
What's your name, sweetheart?

247
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:15,894
It's Jenny, sir.

248
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:20,482
Jenny?

249
00:23:22,192 --> 00:23:23,276
Yes.

250
00:23:25,612 --> 00:23:27,155
Jenny's already dead…

251
00:23:29,825 --> 00:23:31,159
Yeseo.

252
00:23:41,378 --> 00:23:43,255
Why would a good girl like you

253
00:23:44,631 --> 00:23:47,008
become friends with someone like Jenny?

254
00:23:49,219 --> 00:23:50,429
You son of a…

255
00:23:50,512 --> 00:23:51,680
Yeseo, no!

256
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:05,819
Are you two friends?

257
00:24:06,445 --> 00:24:08,613
Die!

258
00:24:32,762 --> 00:24:34,264
Yeseo!

259
00:24:34,347 --> 00:24:36,433
Kang Yeseo!

260
00:25:03,585 --> 00:25:05,128
Dad!

261
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:09,341
Yeseo!

262
00:25:10,717 --> 00:25:11,885
Shit.

263
00:25:12,469 --> 00:25:16,765
Hmm. No wonder she's so courageous.

264
00:25:17,265 --> 00:25:18,934
The daughter of a detective.

265
00:25:19,809 --> 00:25:20,852
She's got no fear.

266
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:23,355
Let my daughter go.

267
00:25:24,731 --> 00:25:26,650
Well, I warned you, didn't I?

268
00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:29,110
All right, okay. Okay.

269
00:25:29,194 --> 00:25:31,112
Let go of her and we'll talk. Okay?

270
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:33,156
No, no, no.

271
00:25:34,157 --> 00:25:36,117
Instead, watch closely…

272
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:39,454
Watch how your daughter
turns into a junkie

273
00:25:39,538 --> 00:25:41,790
and starts walking on all fours.

274
00:25:42,374 --> 00:25:44,000
Stop! No!

275
00:25:50,173 --> 00:25:51,800
Yeseo!

276
00:25:53,677 --> 00:25:55,011
Yeseo.

277
00:25:55,554 --> 00:25:57,138
Yeseo!

278
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:05,063
What shall I do?

279
00:26:06,064 --> 00:26:08,400
Let her live as a junkie in pain,

280
00:26:08,483 --> 00:26:11,903
or should I kill her now
so she doesn't suffer?

281
00:26:11,987 --> 00:26:14,114
No! Kill me, not her!

282
00:26:20,245 --> 00:26:21,955
What would you choose?

283
00:26:23,498 --> 00:26:25,292
It's your call.

284
00:26:31,089 --> 00:26:32,549
No! Yeseo!

285
00:26:34,426 --> 00:26:35,719
-No, no, Yeseo! Stop it!
-Yeseo!

286
00:26:44,894 --> 00:26:45,895
Yeseo.

287
00:26:48,565 --> 00:26:50,942
Yeseo, Yeseo. Wake up.

288
00:26:51,026 --> 00:26:52,485
Yeseo.

289
00:26:52,569 --> 00:26:54,112
Yeseo, wake up.

290
00:26:54,195 --> 00:26:55,697
Come on.

291
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:56,906
Wake up.

292
00:26:57,866 --> 00:27:00,243
Yeseo, please.

293
00:27:00,327 --> 00:27:03,955
-What the hell are you doing? Stop!
-She'll die if we don't do this at least.

294
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:05,999
We've got to try!

295
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:14,382
Open the airway.
Open the airway.

296
00:27:14,466 --> 00:27:17,427
- Yeseo, breathe. Breathe, Yeseo.
- Yeseo. Yeseo!

297
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:19,971
Wake up, come on. Please.

298
00:27:20,055 --> 00:27:21,389
Oppa's here, baby.

299
00:27:21,473 --> 00:27:22,807
Kang Yeseo!

300
00:27:22,891 --> 00:27:24,643
Yeseo, wake up. Come on.

301
00:27:25,268 --> 00:27:28,938
Yeseo! Yeseo! Come on.
Breathe, baby, breathe! Please.

302
00:27:29,022 --> 00:27:30,857
Please.

303
00:27:32,192 --> 00:27:33,360
Yeseo.

304
00:27:36,029 --> 00:27:37,906
Yeseo, breathe. Breathe, Yeseo.

305
00:27:40,283 --> 00:27:41,284
Yeseo.

306
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:42,911
Yeseo?

307
00:27:43,912 --> 00:27:45,830
Yeseo. Are you okay?

308
00:27:46,331 --> 00:27:47,749
Can you see me?

309
00:27:49,542 --> 00:27:51,002
You're okay.

310
00:27:55,131 --> 00:27:56,591
He's getting away, Captain!

311
00:28:05,517 --> 00:28:06,518
Yeseo.

312
00:28:08,311 --> 00:28:09,688
I'll be right back.

313
00:28:15,193 --> 00:28:16,569
Please protect her.

314
00:28:47,225 --> 00:28:48,435
Come on. Step on it.

315
00:29:39,736 --> 00:29:41,154
Gonna shoot me?

316
00:29:51,122 --> 00:29:52,248
Here.

317
00:29:54,125 --> 00:29:55,710
Cuff me. Go ahead.

318
00:29:55,794 --> 00:29:56,795
Yeah?

319
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:00,465
Dad!

320
00:31:47,906 --> 00:31:50,074
What are you going to do
with all the money you earn

321
00:31:50,575 --> 00:31:51,993
from working your ass off?

322
00:31:53,578 --> 00:31:55,997
I'll work until I can leave this business.

323
00:32:02,962 --> 00:32:05,465
I want to go to a place
somewhere like that,

324
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:08,468
where I can lounge till I die gracefully.

325
00:32:34,452 --> 00:32:36,621
By the way, what's your real name?

326
00:32:41,584 --> 00:32:42,877
Minseok.

327
00:33:07,235 --> 00:33:09,946
You don't have anywhere else to go.
We're in the same boat.

328
00:33:12,824 --> 00:33:14,951
Can't we all just keep working together?

329
00:33:16,703 --> 00:33:19,247
I trust you to protect us, Minseok.

330
00:35:12,819 --> 00:35:15,863
LEE JUNGHWA, KIM JAEHEE
REST IN PEACE

331
00:35:25,957 --> 00:35:27,625
I'm gonna beat you.

332
00:35:27,708 --> 00:35:30,545
- Just try. You don't have a chance.
- Here I go.

333
00:35:31,045 --> 00:35:32,547
No, I will.

334
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:34,715
Hey, no cheating. Don't cross the line.

335
00:35:34,799 --> 00:35:36,342
Hey! Hey!

336
00:35:37,552 --> 00:35:38,928
Don't cross it!

337
00:35:39,011 --> 00:35:40,847
What are you gonna do now?

338
00:35:41,681 --> 00:35:42,849
Hey!

339
00:36:53,252 --> 00:36:54,253
GANGNAM, SEOUL

340
00:36:54,337 --> 00:36:55,755
The shocking video vividly captures

341
00:36:55,838 --> 00:36:57,924
the frightening scene of a live drug test,

342
00:36:58,007 --> 00:37:02,303
and clearly shows the faces of a few
notable figures from the political world.

343
00:37:02,386 --> 00:37:05,264
Furthermore, tens of thousands
of CCTV footage

344
00:37:05,348 --> 00:37:08,684
tapes from inside the building
have been submitted as evidence.

345
00:37:08,768 --> 00:37:12,563
We also learned that the names of dozens
of Korean and foreign political leaders

346
00:37:12,647 --> 00:37:16,776
were found in foreign ghost account
statements of HI International,

347
00:37:16,859 --> 00:37:19,570
the parent company
of Hae Il Biopharmaceutical.

348
00:37:19,654 --> 00:37:23,157
Meanwhile, the release of Hae Il's
latest products, Leon and Leon Plus,

349
00:37:23,241 --> 00:37:25,034
will be postponed indefinitely.

350
00:37:36,254 --> 00:37:38,714
What's your relationship with
the late prosecutor General Tak?

351
00:37:38,798 --> 00:37:40,925
What made you decide to blow the whistle
on the prosecution?

352
00:37:41,008 --> 00:37:43,719
Who was falsely accused as the culprit?

353
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:48,766
I will fully cooperate
with the investigation.

354
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:53,437
Ma'am, ma'am! Excuse me!

355
00:37:56,232 --> 00:37:58,192
The prosecution's
investigation is beginning very shortly.

356
00:37:58,276 --> 00:37:59,277
PEOPLE OVER ISSUE

357
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:00,361
Tell us, how do you feel?

358
00:38:00,444 --> 00:38:02,822
I'm sure the title "whistle-blower"
has to carry a lot of weight,

359
00:38:02,905 --> 00:38:04,198
especially in this scenario.

360
00:38:04,282 --> 00:38:07,118
When exactly
did you begin this lonely battle?

361
00:38:08,536 --> 00:38:09,537
A year ago,

362
00:38:10,329 --> 00:38:12,999
I was approached
by former-Chief Prosecutor, Tak Juil.

363
00:38:13,708 --> 00:38:16,419
He ordered me to frame and prosecute
an innocent man

364
00:38:16,502 --> 00:38:17,962
in the Gangnam missing persons' case.

365
00:38:18,045 --> 00:38:19,255
At the time,

366
00:38:20,506 --> 00:38:21,966
I was seduced by the…

367
00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:24,552
the idea of a promotion,

368
00:38:24,635 --> 00:38:26,137
so I acquiesced.

369
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:29,223
It wasn't long before I figured out
that a criminal organization

370
00:38:29,307 --> 00:38:31,434
was involved in the case.

371
00:38:32,059 --> 00:38:36,105
A criminal organization allied
with a cartel of politicians.

372
00:38:37,315 --> 00:38:38,691
Powerful politicians.

373
00:38:39,483 --> 00:38:40,651
As a low-level prosecutor,

374
00:38:40,735 --> 00:38:45,906
I-I realized that I had no chance
of taking them down myself.

375
00:38:47,199 --> 00:38:49,660
As a prosecutor for the Republic of Korea,

376
00:38:49,744 --> 00:38:54,457
I admit I permitted myself
to be a bystander and an accomplice

377
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:56,125
to their heinous crimes…

378
00:38:58,669 --> 00:39:01,297
and I should willingly pay the price.

379
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:12,641
The business had been closed
since yesterday, so that's kind of fishy.

380
00:39:13,142 --> 00:39:14,143
You sure about this?

381
00:39:14,226 --> 00:39:17,104
Last time, we even called for backup,
but it turned out to be nothing.

382
00:39:17,188 --> 00:39:18,981
So, what? I'm not supposed to go?

383
00:39:19,065 --> 00:39:20,232
Get in the car.

384
00:39:44,048 --> 00:39:45,841
We're police.
Can you tell me what happened?

385
00:39:45,925 --> 00:39:46,926
Damn it!

386
00:39:47,009 --> 00:39:48,886
That punk set it on fire again and fled.

387
00:39:48,969 --> 00:39:50,137
- Goddamn it.
- Shit!

388
00:39:50,221 --> 00:39:51,222
Hey, what's going on?

389
00:39:51,305 --> 00:39:52,223
I don't know.

390
00:39:52,306 --> 00:39:54,725
Some lunatic came in with a bat
and beat the shit out of us.

391
00:39:56,143 --> 00:39:57,853
God, yeah. It's him again.

392
00:39:58,646 --> 00:39:59,897
-Wrap it up quick.
-Yes, sir.

393
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:00,856
Hey, come on out.

394
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:00,916
Captain. Backup is here.

395
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,626
Looks like they're almost done.

396
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:05,754
Guess there are more of these idiots
in Apgujeong Rodeo right now.

397
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:07,756
Let's go.

398
00:41:09,633 --> 00:41:11,010
There's work to do.

399
00:41:12,011 --> 00:41:13,053
Yes, sir.
