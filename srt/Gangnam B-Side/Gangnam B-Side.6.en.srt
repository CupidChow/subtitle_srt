Starting navigation.

7
00:01:41,684 --> 00:01:43,269
Stop staring.

8
00:01:44,145 --> 00:01:46,106
Let's just go, all right? Please.

9
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:14,300
These are yours to borrow.

10
00:02:14,384 --> 00:02:15,385
Be careful up there.

11
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:31,192
-Minhee, right?
-Yes. Jinwoo?

12
00:02:31,276 --> 00:02:32,610
Yep. Follow me.

13
00:02:39,701 --> 00:02:41,911
YOU CAN DO
ONE MORE ROUND TODAY, RIGHT?

14
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:44,289
ONE CLIENT, FROM CLUB REGENCY
TO ASENTI HOTEL SUITE

15
00:02:47,542 --> 00:02:49,878
GOT IT

X-CROSS. VIP ROOM. PICK UP

18
00:03:58,863 --> 00:04:00,281
Chauffeur's going in.

19
00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:13,294
Hey.
You're the chauffeur, yeah?

20
00:04:13,378 --> 00:04:15,046
Over there. Goddamn…

21
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:17,757
Come on. Hurry and get her out.

22
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:21,052
Finally. Get her out. Get her out of here.

23
00:04:23,179 --> 00:04:24,681
Somebody had a little too much.

24
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:28,351
I called over some more
bitches. Five minutes, tops. All right?

25
00:04:28,434 --> 00:04:31,062
Get away from me!

26
00:04:33,231 --> 00:04:35,024
Give me my money!

27
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:37,193
Why are you still here?
Just leave already.

28
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:38,945
Who brought this fucking psycho?

29
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:42,490
Get that thing out of my fucking face!

30
00:04:43,074 --> 00:04:44,701
Oh, this is totally ruining the vibe.

31
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:46,744
You fucking bitch.

32
00:04:46,828 --> 00:04:50,039
Get her out, man.

33
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:52,917
What? What are you looking at?

34
00:04:53,584 --> 00:04:55,169
Fuck, you're just a driver,

35
00:04:55,253 --> 00:04:57,255
you fat loser.

36
00:04:57,338 --> 00:05:00,008
Shit, this is fucking hilarious.

37
00:05:00,091 --> 00:05:02,427
Oh. Oh, hey, hey! What the hell?

38
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:03,594
Get away.

39
00:05:04,595 --> 00:05:05,638
Jesus fucking Christ!

40
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:07,682
Oh, fuck.

41
00:05:13,229 --> 00:05:14,272
Your scarf…

42
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:16,524
for her trouble.

43
00:05:17,233 --> 00:05:19,360
Wait. Hey, you fucker!

44
00:05:19,444 --> 00:05:21,529
Do you know how much
that scarf cost, asshole?

45
00:05:21,612 --> 00:05:22,447
Hey!

46
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:29,871
Mister.

47
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,458
Should I just talk to a reporter
about that guy?

48
00:05:34,542 --> 00:05:37,086
That asshole's father
is some kind of government minister.

49
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:39,380
He said he had a clean drug test.

50
00:05:40,089 --> 00:05:41,966
You saw how high he was though, right?

51
00:05:42,967 --> 00:05:44,010
What is this?

52
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:46,721
Where did you get this?

53
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:48,931
Did the blond guy bring it?

54
00:05:49,974 --> 00:05:51,059
Aha!

55
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:54,062
Ah, so you're that lunatic.

56
00:05:54,562 --> 00:05:57,815
I heard about some crazy guy
who keeps causing trouble,

57
00:05:57,899 --> 00:06:00,068
looking for Neon all around Gangnam.

58
00:06:00,151 --> 00:06:01,152
It's you, right?

59
00:06:03,154 --> 00:06:04,447
"Neon"?

60
00:06:10,453 --> 00:06:11,621
Get out of the car.

61
00:06:13,122 --> 00:06:14,332
Suin.

62
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:16,876
Get out now.

63
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:26,636
Thanks. I canceled my call.

64
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:29,138
So, you can go ahead
and get on your way, all right.

65
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:31,557
She needs to be taken to a hospital,
I think.

66
00:06:35,019 --> 00:06:36,437
What's the problem?

67
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:49,492
FLY RESIDENCE

68
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,400
NEON

CAPTAIN, PLEASE ANSWER THE PHONE

73
00:07:57,643 --> 00:07:59,562
REPLY AT LEAST

74
00:07:59,645 --> 00:08:01,439
JISU KEEPS CALLING ME

75
00:08:05,568 --> 00:08:07,361
Is this really necessary?

76
00:08:07,445 --> 00:08:08,779
The case is closed.

77
00:08:08,863 --> 00:08:11,908
That girl walked in and took her own life,
all right, Dongwoo?

78
00:08:12,742 --> 00:08:16,746
You do realize, I barely managed
to swing a relocation for you

79
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:20,249
to the countryside to cover up
how carelessly you handled your witness.

80
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:23,669
I've already troubled the police too much.

81
00:08:24,295 --> 00:08:27,048
I've also caused inconvenience to you,
Commissioner.

82
00:08:27,757 --> 00:08:30,343
I don't deserve to remain on the force.

83
00:08:34,263 --> 00:08:35,264
Dongwoo.

84
00:08:37,475 --> 00:08:39,060
You are not to blame, all right?

85
00:08:40,269 --> 00:08:42,522
Your daughter may have been friends
with that dead girl,

86
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:43,981
but that's not your fault.

87
00:08:45,107 --> 00:08:49,820
Giving up your badge
won't bring Yeseo home, will it?

88
00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:55,368
DEACTIVATED

89
00:08:57,036 --> 00:08:58,037
2 WEEKS AGO

90
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,288
NONHYEON-DONG

91
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:15,179
Oh, Kevin. Hey.

92
00:09:15,763 --> 00:09:18,057
-Not a minute too soon.
-On time, yeah?

93
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:21,811
This is…

94
00:09:30,903 --> 00:09:31,988
Take care.

95
00:09:49,046 --> 00:09:51,507
-Hey, guys. That the stuff?
-Yeah.

96
00:09:57,388 --> 00:09:58,681
All right, see you.

97
00:10:47,229 --> 00:10:50,191
What the fuck?
Shit, I thought you left Gangnam.

98
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,364
I didn't know. I swear.

99
00:10:56,864 --> 00:11:00,076
It's just those fuckers
offered us a business deal first!

100
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:03,287
What's this? Never seen these.

101
00:11:03,371 --> 00:11:05,831
It's the new stuff Gangnam Trading Co.
is launching soon.

102
00:11:06,582 --> 00:11:08,918
Moving in bulk right now, so it's cheaper.

103
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:11,337
What are you doing?

104
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:12,838
What's wrong with you? Hey!

105
00:11:12,922 --> 00:11:15,591
The Director! Damn. It's the Director!

106
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:17,802
I'm being forced to sell it
because of him!

107
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:20,096
-The Director?
-You know,

108
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:23,099
that man with the screwed up face
who took over now. That guy!

109
00:11:28,729 --> 00:11:30,856
Oh, hey, hey, hey! Fuck!

110
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:34,819
Oh, no! Oh, shit!

111
00:11:34,902 --> 00:11:36,904
Fuck!

112
00:11:36,987 --> 00:11:38,239
Oh, no!

113
00:11:50,918 --> 00:11:53,671
As the prosecutor who resolved
the Gangnam missing persons' cases,

114
00:11:53,754 --> 00:11:57,216
what external pressures influenced your
decision to stall the drug investigation

115
00:11:57,299 --> 00:11:59,427
involving the son of Lee Hanpyeong,
the Minister of Health?

116
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:00,970
The investigation isn't stalled.

117
00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:03,389
It's closed because we couldn't
charge him without any evidence.

118
00:12:03,472 --> 00:12:05,975
It's rare for prosecutors
from less prestigious schools

119
00:12:06,058 --> 00:12:08,811
to make their way through,
to serving as Chief of Anti-corruption.

120
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,480
What was behind your incredible ascent?

121
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:15,568
Is it as incredible as you make it sound?

122
00:12:15,651 --> 00:12:17,987
Do you have the same connections
as Mr. Tak Juil,

123
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:19,655
the former Chief Prosecutor?

124
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:23,033
That is, you are part of his inner circle.

125
00:12:23,117 --> 00:12:25,619
And since he moved up
to the Presidential Office,

126
00:12:25,703 --> 00:12:27,788
and you've also been on a roll lately,

127
00:12:27,872 --> 00:12:32,042
one wonders if someone's assisting you
in your turn toward a political career.

128
00:12:32,126 --> 00:12:37,006
You know, in exchange for protecting
conglomerates or something of that kind.

129
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:40,634
Prosecutor Min Seojin.
I must say I admire you.

130
00:12:41,302 --> 00:12:43,471
What if you were to join me on my team?

131
00:12:43,971 --> 00:12:46,307
Isn't Mr. Tak your business associate too?

132
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:52,772
Tak got impatient, joined up
with the Chief of Staff in the end.

133
00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:56,650
Even though I made him a Chief Prosecutor.

134
00:12:57,401 --> 00:12:58,569
Ingrate.

135
00:12:59,653 --> 00:13:01,822
I never betray anyone on my team,

136
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:05,326
unless they betray me first.

137
00:13:05,409 --> 00:13:06,535
I see.

138
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:09,705
But using someone
then throwing them aside is another thing.

139
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:15,127
If you'd prefer not to, I understand.

140
00:13:15,211 --> 00:13:17,087
But I don't like to repeat myself.

141
00:13:22,843 --> 00:13:23,677
Mr. Choi…

142
00:13:25,846 --> 00:13:27,264
what can you do for me?

143
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:40,402
I'll give you a set of wings.

144
00:13:41,612 --> 00:13:45,574
It's entirely up to you
how high you want to soar.

145
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,332
You work a lot of overtime here too.

146
00:13:57,211 --> 00:13:58,921
Just wanted to give you some intel.

147
00:13:59,004 --> 00:14:02,049
This is Neon. It's a brand-new drug
going around the clubs.

148
00:14:03,926 --> 00:14:05,469
About two days ago,

149
00:14:05,553 --> 00:14:07,805
someone saw the vice minister's son
taking some.

150
00:14:08,305 --> 00:14:12,017
Investigation was closed by you,
for lack of evidence.

151
00:14:12,101 --> 00:14:13,435
So, you might need this.

152
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:15,312
You're making me uncomfortable.

153
00:14:15,396 --> 00:14:18,315
You don't understand,
you're a civilian now.

154
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:20,776
Why don't you finally
start behaving like one, yeah?

155
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:25,030
Don't encourage wild conspiracies
when you don't have any proof.

156
00:14:27,074 --> 00:14:29,034
So, you don't want my evidence.

157
00:14:29,618 --> 00:14:31,245
Don't come back here.

158
00:14:32,246 --> 00:14:34,540
If you don't mind, who do you work for?

159
00:14:35,124 --> 00:14:37,459
Choi Bugi, with One Hour News Network.

160
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:40,379
And I manage my own news channel
online as well.

161
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:45,384
A prosecutor's ultimate goal is justice,
not a career in politics.

162
00:14:45,467 --> 00:14:48,721
And Mr. Tak was my superior
and nothing more than that.

163
00:14:50,431 --> 00:14:55,352
You do realize that professional
reporters usually ask serious questions?

164
00:14:55,436 --> 00:14:57,062
Because our time is limited here.

165
00:14:58,355 --> 00:15:00,107
Got it, Mr. Online? Hmm?

166
00:15:01,859 --> 00:15:05,905
We guarantee our commitment
to securing professional nutritionists

167
00:15:05,988 --> 00:15:08,198
and smart patient care technology.

168
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:11,368
We will establish a dream town

169
00:15:11,452 --> 00:15:14,830
where specialized
and customized medical services

170
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:17,791
enable individuals
to maintain mental health

171
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:21,420
and enjoy a fulfilling life
well into their later years.

172
00:15:23,255 --> 00:15:25,758
The healthcare town everyone dreams of.

173
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:28,385
HI Healthcare Town.

174
00:15:28,886 --> 00:15:30,846
HI International will make it happen.

175
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:36,769
Not bad, not bad at all.

176
00:15:36,852 --> 00:15:39,688
What do you think? Quiet impressive,
wouldn't you say, Vice Minister?

177
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:41,315
Yeah!

178
00:15:42,316 --> 00:15:44,485
And Weiho Group's Medical Center
has been approved.

179
00:15:44,568 --> 00:15:47,071
So, as long as we present it well
to the media at the conference,

180
00:15:47,154 --> 00:15:49,323
we shouldn't have too much of a problem
securing the funding.

181
00:15:49,406 --> 00:15:53,243
There won't be any issues there.
Not under Mr. Choi's watch!

182
00:15:53,327 --> 00:15:54,536
Cheers!

183
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:56,121
Yes, cheers!

184
00:15:57,247 --> 00:15:59,541
Without Mr. Choi,
this couldn't have been possible.

185
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:02,086
It isn't easy to get the Chinese
to open their wallets.

186
00:16:02,169 --> 00:16:05,339
And the funding's at one trillion won.
Can you believe that?

187
00:16:05,422 --> 00:16:09,510
We're simply honored to offer
our support saving our great nation.

188
00:16:09,593 --> 00:16:10,844
If I'm honest.

189
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:12,596
Support, you say?

190
00:16:14,098 --> 00:16:16,767
Isn't that usually done behind the scenes?

191
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:20,354
In our great nation, there are people
who don't even have homes.

192
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:25,401
If you wanted to save it,
you should build some apartments instead.

193
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:26,527
I'm just saying,

194
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:28,779
building a healthcare town for the rich…

195
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:32,324
The public won't be that thrilled.

196
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:33,450
My two cents.

197
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:37,997
Secretary Tak, why are you already
the president's man?

198
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:44,545
Well, I imagine this should
be carefully considered as well,

199
00:16:44,628 --> 00:16:47,631
so I sent the whole proposal again
to the president.

200
00:16:47,715 --> 00:16:49,133
And Mayor Woo agreed to it.

201
00:16:50,217 --> 00:16:53,012
Sorry, but… but what does that mean?

202
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:55,055
What does it mean?

203
00:16:55,931 --> 00:16:57,433
It means that he's not a fool.

204
00:16:57,516 --> 00:16:59,560
His objections make sense
if you think about it.

205
00:16:59,643 --> 00:17:02,062
These fancy-plate dinners

206
00:17:02,938 --> 00:17:04,440
barely got any meat.

207
00:17:05,524 --> 00:17:07,818
Mayor Woo, let's get some oxtail soup.

208
00:17:07,901 --> 00:17:10,571
-What do you say? Let's go.
-You know, oxtail soup sounds great.

209
00:17:11,155 --> 00:17:13,365
-Wait, Secretary Tak.
-Where are you going, Mayor Woo? Come on.

210
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:14,366
See you.

211
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:16,326
- Mayor Woo!
- Wait, come back!

212
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:17,453
Mayor Woo!

213
00:17:19,997 --> 00:17:22,750
YANGJAE CHICKEN

214
00:17:23,667 --> 00:17:27,004
Why do you keep bothering me?
I'm a busy man.

215
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:30,966
Why can't you stay on target?

216
00:17:32,342 --> 00:17:35,304
Bio Town is a done deal.
Why are you still discussing it?

217
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:38,974
God, we're not talking about
some mom-and-pop operation.

218
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:43,437
Do you even realize how many guys
we sacrificed looking for that video?

219
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,314
That's a bigger loss than you think.

220
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:48,275
And besides, I never got my money
from the Colosseum either.

221
00:17:48,984 --> 00:17:51,445
And if it weren't for me interfering,

222
00:17:52,196 --> 00:17:55,032
this mess would've gone
way beyond Noh Joonseo.

223
00:17:55,115 --> 00:17:56,533
I hope you realize that.

224
00:17:58,285 --> 00:17:59,286
That's it?

225
00:18:00,454 --> 00:18:03,707
The Colosseum gets busted,
but you still want your 30% cut?

226
00:18:08,378 --> 00:18:09,421
Yes, I want it.

227
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:13,133
Of course, circumstances have changed.

228
00:18:13,217 --> 00:18:15,677
May not look like it…

229
00:18:16,845 --> 00:18:18,514
…but I do have a law degree.

230
00:18:19,014 --> 00:18:21,391
So, I may as well put my degree to use

231
00:18:21,475 --> 00:18:26,438
and become the minister
of my own happiness, if you will.

232
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:34,530
MAYOR WOO RECONSIDERS LAND USE

233
00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:35,781
LOW-COST APARTMENTS
OVER BIO TOWN

234
00:18:35,864 --> 00:18:36,990
Gyonam's Mayor Woo Daesik.

235
00:18:37,074 --> 00:18:40,285
He's quite problematic,
but his wife is even worse.

236
00:18:40,994 --> 00:18:42,204
His wife, Ms. Yoo,

237
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:46,333
is the director of a venture capitalist
firm called Seowon Holdings.

238
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:47,417
WUGI BUGI

239
00:18:47,501 --> 00:18:50,170
This firm took an illegal loan
of 2.5 billion won.

240
00:18:50,254 --> 00:18:52,172
And they got it from a bank in 2019,

241
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:55,050
just to acquire a piece of fine art.

242
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:57,928
Now, what would venture capitalists
want to do that for?

243
00:18:58,011 --> 00:19:01,515
Well, turns out this piece of fine art
happens to be at his wife's place.

244
00:19:01,598 --> 00:19:03,976
This married couple
was messing with all sorts…

245
00:19:04,059 --> 00:19:06,228
No, no, no. Listen.
You need to look into it.

246
00:19:06,311 --> 00:19:08,730
Rumor has it,
it's the Head Prosecutors' office.

247
00:19:09,857 --> 00:19:10,983
They're investigating us.

248
00:19:11,066 --> 00:19:13,569
And no one can say
how much they've got on us, all right?

249
00:19:14,444 --> 00:19:15,779
Anything is possible.

250
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:18,031
Know which prosecutor it is?

251
00:19:19,116 --> 00:19:21,743
It's this woman
in the Anti-corruption Department.

252
00:19:22,411 --> 00:19:25,038
Her name is Min. Min Seojin.

253
00:19:26,123 --> 00:19:27,124
What?

254
00:19:29,209 --> 00:19:31,211
I guess she's here already.

255
00:19:32,129 --> 00:19:33,964
Mayor Woo. Mayor…

256
00:19:35,132 --> 00:19:36,341
Ah, shit.

257
00:19:37,384 --> 00:19:39,636
I was let in when I said
I was the prosecution.

258
00:19:42,097 --> 00:19:45,100
Get out. Watch the door. Get out.

259
00:19:45,642 --> 00:19:46,643
Geez.

260
00:19:47,728 --> 00:19:50,856
If you needed something, you realize
you could've sent your people

261
00:19:50,939 --> 00:19:52,232
or some documents.

262
00:19:53,108 --> 00:19:56,570
I'm a busy man who doesn't like to be
chased down like he owes a loan shark.

263
00:19:57,571 --> 00:20:00,908
Loan fraud isn't an interest of mine,
but your wife is certainly curious.

264
00:20:04,953 --> 00:20:07,956
How dare you threaten me
with this bullshit?

265
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:11,501
Get out while I'm still being nice.

266
00:20:13,962 --> 00:20:15,339
That's quite rude of you.

267
00:20:16,131 --> 00:20:18,300
I came to offer help,
and this is how you act?

268
00:20:19,009 --> 00:20:21,970
I wanted to come in person
so I could give you some…

269
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:26,308
some useful tips based on
these interesting loopholes I found.

270
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:28,685
"Useful tips"?

271
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:33,607
This is the Land Use Change
Confirmation for Bio Town.

272
00:20:34,524 --> 00:20:36,485
Signed by the Mayor of Gyonam as well.

273
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:39,947
He's going to send the rest
of the papers within a few days.

274
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:41,740
MAYOR OF GYONAM

275
00:20:42,783 --> 00:20:44,576
Mayor Woo was persuaded, then?

276
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:46,286
Well, he's a very loving husband.

277
00:20:46,828 --> 00:20:49,623
He invited me to a meal with his wife.

278
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:52,834
Threesomes are the go-to for that creep.

279
00:20:53,335 --> 00:20:55,254
But he's actually pretty shy.

280
00:20:55,337 --> 00:20:57,506
We succeeded
in finally convincing Mayor Woo.

281
00:20:58,006 --> 00:21:00,676
The secretary is a persistent man though.

282
00:21:01,677 --> 00:21:04,012
He will do whatever it takes
to achieve what he wants.

283
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:05,138
He's a bulldog.

284
00:21:06,848 --> 00:21:07,975
I'll take care of that.

285
00:21:08,684 --> 00:21:10,852
I want you to dig up some dirt
on these people.

286
00:21:13,772 --> 00:21:16,858
We might need to change a few laws
and ordinances, so be discreet.

287
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:18,235
GANGNAM TAX OFFICE
RECIPIENT: CHO GYUNGSOON

288
00:21:18,318 --> 00:21:19,319
RESULT OF TAX INVESTIGATION

289
00:21:19,403 --> 00:21:21,738
Cho Gyungsoon is
the Minister of Food and Drug Safety.

290
00:21:21,822 --> 00:21:23,573
What do you need with the ministry?

291
00:21:26,243 --> 00:21:27,661
Why?

292
00:21:27,744 --> 00:21:30,664
I need to know where to dig
in order to do the right research.

293
00:21:31,164 --> 00:21:34,793
If we're gonna be changing ordinances,
that's no easy feat.

294
00:21:36,586 --> 00:21:40,924
It was also no easy feat
to promote a low-level prosecutor

295
00:21:41,008 --> 00:21:42,676
to Chief of Anti-corruption.

296
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:45,304
Am I right, Seojin?

297
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:49,808
We didn't scout you
to take on easy feats, did we?

298
00:21:52,728 --> 00:21:53,895
Oh, Prosecutor Min.

299
00:21:54,604 --> 00:21:55,981
Uh, ma'am…

300
00:22:01,653 --> 00:22:03,030
What are you doing?

301
00:22:04,656 --> 00:22:06,116
What the fuck are you doing?

302
00:22:06,199 --> 00:22:08,785
How dare you join hands with Woo Daesik
and double-cross us?

303
00:22:08,869 --> 00:22:11,330
Now that you're working there
at the Head Prosecutors' Office,

304
00:22:11,413 --> 00:22:12,873
you pull this crap?

305
00:22:13,498 --> 00:22:15,375
I can see you're feeling guilty.

306
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:19,379
Before you started your day,
you came all the way over here.

307
00:22:19,463 --> 00:22:23,508
Look, learn the difference
between friends and foes, Seojin.

308
00:22:24,051 --> 00:22:28,430
Whatever you're up to,
you remain my underling, okay?

309
00:22:28,513 --> 00:22:32,184
And if I get brought down,
you go down too, don't you forget it.

310
00:22:32,267 --> 00:22:37,606
Well, I do know the difference between
a friend and a foe, now better than ever.

311
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:39,399
Oh, really?

312
00:22:40,108 --> 00:22:40,984
You little…

313
00:22:41,068 --> 00:22:43,445
I can't appreciate you enough
for coming here.

314
00:22:43,528 --> 00:22:46,239
It made it so much easier.

315
00:22:51,787 --> 00:22:53,789
- What is it? What?
- Sorry, Mr. Tak, but--

316
00:22:53,872 --> 00:22:55,832
People from the prosecution
are here for a search,

317
00:22:55,916 --> 00:22:58,460
and just, you should really be here, sir.

318
00:23:00,504 --> 00:23:01,546
You…

319
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:05,300
You used to be my superior.

320
00:23:05,801 --> 00:23:07,636
It would be only right
that I take you downtown.

321
00:23:07,719 --> 00:23:09,054
Wouldn't you say so?

322
00:23:09,137 --> 00:23:11,348
Sneaky little bitch.

323
00:23:11,848 --> 00:23:14,684
Oh. A message I was told to relay…

324
00:23:16,895 --> 00:23:19,523
"You should've taken
the mom-and-pop business deal.

325
00:23:20,399 --> 00:23:23,068
You don't have what it takes
to be a minister anyhow."

326
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:25,445
Ah, yes.

327
00:23:26,655 --> 00:23:31,993
No wonder a nobody-bitch like you
suddenly began to rise through the ranks.

328
00:23:32,869 --> 00:23:35,330
It's all 'cause you teamed up
with that old fool, huh?

329
00:23:35,414 --> 00:23:36,581
Mr. Tak Juil.

330
00:23:37,457 --> 00:23:39,709
I am placing you under arrest,

331
00:23:39,793 --> 00:23:41,878
on suspicion of corruption and bribery.

332
00:23:41,962 --> 00:23:43,547
"Arrest," my ass.

333
00:23:45,298 --> 00:23:48,260
You've got to be fucking kidding me. Shit.

334
00:23:48,343 --> 00:23:50,387
Sir, come with us.

335
00:24:02,023 --> 00:24:03,108
Min Seojin.

336
00:24:05,861 --> 00:24:07,112
I wouldn't celebrate.

337
00:24:09,239 --> 00:24:12,826
'Cause you're gonna regret it
one day soon.

338
00:24:33,513 --> 00:24:35,140
Were you gonna crack my skull?

339
00:24:35,223 --> 00:24:36,475
God, this fucking guy!

340
00:24:37,893 --> 00:24:39,561
How could you do that to us?

341
00:24:39,644 --> 00:24:41,021
You just disappeared.

342
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:44,816
I mean, I checked out
all the motels in this area.

343
00:24:46,693 --> 00:24:49,946
We're not gonna find her
by just chasing our asses around Gangnam.

344
00:24:50,822 --> 00:24:54,117
Dongwoo, wouldn't it be faster
if we just had our boys ask around

345
00:24:54,201 --> 00:24:55,619
with a picture of Yeseo?

346
00:24:58,705 --> 00:25:01,041
She'll make it harder
for us to find her if we do.

347
00:25:02,375 --> 00:25:05,462
Are you sure Yeseo is even here?

348
00:25:17,307 --> 00:25:18,183
What's this?

349
00:25:18,892 --> 00:25:22,229
Jaehee's account is logged in.
And it keeps moving around Gangnam.

NONHYEON-DONG, GANGNAM

352
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:31,238
WHO ARE YOU? ARE YOU… YESEO?

353
00:25:31,321 --> 00:25:32,447
YESEO, IT'S DAD

354
00:25:32,531 --> 00:25:33,823
WHERE ARE YOU?
LET'S MEET AND TALK

355
00:25:36,368 --> 00:25:39,746
THERE'S SOMETHING I NEED TO DO

356
00:25:39,829 --> 00:25:43,250
WHAT IS IT? LET'S MEET AND

357
00:25:43,333 --> 00:25:45,669
DON'T EVER LOOK FOR ME AGAIN

358

DEACTIVATED

359
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:52,926
Last week, I got so close
to where she was.

360
00:25:53,009 --> 00:25:54,302
JUST NOW
LOCATION: NONHYEON-DONG

361
00:25:54,386 --> 00:25:56,680
Then she disappeared all of a sudden.

362
00:25:59,224 --> 00:26:02,686
So, you're gonna do what?
Keep on playing hide-and-seek?

363
00:26:03,311 --> 00:26:05,981
You handed in your badge,
you made yourself a fucking chauffeur,

364
00:26:06,064 --> 00:26:07,816
and you still haven't found shit!

365
00:26:09,526 --> 00:26:12,862
It's descended into absolute chaos
since Noh Joonseo's death.

366
00:26:12,946 --> 00:26:16,992
Looks like the small-time MDs split the
cut among themselves just to stay afloat.

367
00:26:18,493 --> 00:26:21,538
Seems like a new drug
made of meth and a bunch of other shit

368
00:26:21,621 --> 00:26:24,040
is being sold cheap around town.

369
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:26,418
"Neon"?

370
00:26:27,294 --> 00:26:30,672
Oh, yeah, yeah. They're pushing this shit
really aggressively.

371
00:26:30,755 --> 00:26:33,091
What's Yeseo have to do with it?

372
00:26:33,174 --> 00:26:35,051
Wherever this drug was found,

373
00:26:35,677 --> 00:26:37,846
Yeseo's location pinged a cell tower.

374
00:26:38,722 --> 00:26:40,974
What are you saying,
she's mixed up with Neon?

375
00:26:41,641 --> 00:26:43,685
She must have a reason for it.

Don't mind us. Just go.

00:27:27,562 --> 00:27:29,022
Hey, Kim Minhee.

380
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:31,483
Hey.

381
00:27:44,621 --> 00:27:45,622
Where's your car?

382
00:27:47,123 --> 00:27:48,249
Can you give her a ride?

383
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:09,187
The pediatric clinic at Daechi Junction.

384
00:28:49,811 --> 00:28:51,062
I'll wait outside.

385
00:29:20,925 --> 00:29:22,010
Long time no see.

386
00:29:25,764 --> 00:29:28,057
Get the fuck up.

387
00:29:29,225 --> 00:29:30,310
Get up.

388
00:29:34,481 --> 00:29:37,025
You promised last time

389
00:29:37,776 --> 00:29:39,694
you would fucking protect Jaehee.

390
00:29:46,659 --> 00:29:47,827
I'm sorry.

391
00:29:49,662 --> 00:29:51,206
Because she's dead, you mean?

392
00:29:52,248 --> 00:29:54,125
And you're fucking sorry?

393
00:29:58,463 --> 00:29:59,672
From now on,

394
00:30:00,632 --> 00:30:04,677
stay the fuck out of my business.

395
00:30:16,981 --> 00:30:19,192
-Gilho.
-Hey, Choi Suin.

396
00:30:21,027 --> 00:30:24,197
Fuck's sake,
are you hanging out with the cops now?

397
00:30:25,406 --> 00:30:26,407
What do you mean?

398
00:30:26,991 --> 00:30:29,619
I saw you getting out
of that bastard's car.

399
00:30:30,245 --> 00:30:31,496
You mean the chauffeur?

400
00:30:33,289 --> 00:30:35,375
He's helped our girls before,
so I asked for a ride.

401
00:30:35,458 --> 00:30:36,334
Oh, Jesus.

402
00:30:36,417 --> 00:30:38,503
You think he's helping you?

403
00:30:39,504 --> 00:30:40,588
Snap out of it.

404
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:43,341
He's to blame for Jaehee's death.

405
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:54,185
Jaehee…

406
00:30:57,313 --> 00:30:58,857
made the choice herself.

407
00:31:01,776 --> 00:31:03,903
I should've done this ages ago.

408
00:31:06,155 --> 00:31:07,991
I've dragged it out too long.

409
00:31:17,792 --> 00:31:18,793
Whatever.

410
00:31:21,129 --> 00:31:22,922
Where's that bastard K?

411
00:31:24,382 --> 00:31:27,552
I heard he's working for Choi these days,
peddling some drug named Neon.

412
00:31:27,635 --> 00:31:30,054
This is why Jaehee told me
not to tell you about anything,

413
00:31:30,138 --> 00:31:31,806
especially the video.

414
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:33,892
You'll be dead before the video
even gets to Mr. Choi.

415
00:31:33,975 --> 00:31:37,353
Shut up! Is that why you're sucking up
to all these fucking bastards like that?

416
00:31:37,437 --> 00:31:39,147
What do you want me to do?

417
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:40,231
What, quit?

418
00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:41,983
Let me tell you.

419
00:31:43,526 --> 00:31:46,154
As long as I'm surviving in Gangnam,
I don't care who's running it.

420
00:31:48,865 --> 00:31:50,033
Hey, Choi Suin.

421
00:31:52,994 --> 00:31:54,370
How do I find K?

422
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:19,771
TWO GIRLS AT KIM'S CLUB
POSSIBLE?

00:32:21,898 --> 00:32:22,899

424
00:32:25,485 --> 00:32:28,237
BIG PARTY TO CELEBRATE
RELEASE OF NEW DRUG, NEON

Now, if you can please put your phone
into the slot here for us…

429
00:35:42,306 --> 00:35:44,559
And next,
we have to check your coat and bag.

430
00:36:01,075 --> 00:36:02,118
We good?

431
00:36:15,089 --> 00:36:18,551
I'm so glad
I finally got to invite you over.

432
00:36:20,011 --> 00:36:21,429
So what's the urgent matter?

433
00:36:22,138 --> 00:36:24,557
I found records affiliated
with a pharmaceutical company

434
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:26,767
while checking out
Secretary Tak's bank account.

435
00:36:27,894 --> 00:36:30,479
I wanted to check with you
to see if I'm missing anything.

436
00:36:31,105 --> 00:36:32,690
TRANSACTION HISTORY

437
00:36:32,773 --> 00:36:35,193
The pharmaceutical company is yours?

438
00:36:36,027 --> 00:36:38,029
I thought Bio Town was your focus.

439
00:36:39,947 --> 00:36:43,034
I guess it's about time
I share with you,

440
00:36:43,993 --> 00:36:45,995
the details of our business.

441
00:36:48,289 --> 00:36:53,294
Narcotic ingredients,
you may not realize, have been monopolized

442
00:36:53,377 --> 00:36:55,338
by the American pharma companies.

443
00:36:58,257 --> 00:37:00,468
GEEZ, IT'S REALLY IN
A SCHOOL ZONE IN DAECHI-DONG

444
00:37:00,551 --> 00:37:04,222
The company that manufactures narcotic
analgesics also makes the antidote.

445
00:37:04,305 --> 00:37:07,058
The addiction and the cure for it.

446
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:10,061
They won't kill you all at once.

447
00:37:10,144 --> 00:37:13,356
They'll destroy your body
until you become a zombie, for profit.

448
00:37:15,274 --> 00:37:16,567
It's a brave new world.

449
00:37:16,651 --> 00:37:19,445
Instead of distributing crude powders
on the black market…

450
00:37:19,528 --> 00:37:20,738
COPS WON'T PATROL THIS AREA

451
00:37:20,821 --> 00:37:22,740
PARENTS HIRE GUARDS FOR KIDS
TO FOCUS ON THEIR STUDIES

452
00:37:23,991 --> 00:37:28,079
…they mix drugs with narcotic analgesics
to distribute them legally,

453
00:37:28,162 --> 00:37:30,081
then they distribute the cure for it.

454
00:37:30,581 --> 00:37:31,999
It's perfectly elegant.

455
00:37:32,583 --> 00:37:36,045
Ah, fuck! This is so much fun!

456
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:40,508
You guys, this shit right here,
it'll get you high so fucking fast

457
00:37:40,591 --> 00:37:42,718
and won't give you a fucking hangover.

458
00:37:44,095 --> 00:37:45,846
Hey, take a shot.

459
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:46,931
-Cheers.
-Cheers!

460
00:37:47,014 --> 00:37:48,933
Cheers.

461
00:37:50,226 --> 00:37:52,895
People who are reduced
to husks after a few detoxes

462
00:37:52,979 --> 00:37:56,899
can receive treatment from Bio Town,
where their lives will be prolonged.

463
00:37:58,109 --> 00:38:00,861
And business can expand this way forever.

464
00:38:00,945 --> 00:38:03,739
That's why you needed to dig up dirt,
isn't it?

465
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:05,741
To monopolize the ingredients

466
00:38:05,825 --> 00:38:08,160
and get permission
for the rights to sell them?

467
00:38:20,089 --> 00:38:23,217
IT'S LITERALLY A DRUG PARADISE

468
00:38:38,232 --> 00:38:41,527
We've already tested
its potential in focus groups.

469

You're not a chauffeur,
you're a fucking cop.

Why do you keep snooping
around my place of business?

510

You got a crush on me or what?

What is it?

512
00:44:49,269 --> 00:44:52,523
You damaged our business, so
you're gonna have to compensate us for it.
