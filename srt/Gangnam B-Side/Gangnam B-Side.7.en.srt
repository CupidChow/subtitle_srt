1
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:21,563
There will be a crucial
business meeting in a few days.

2
00:00:22,939 --> 00:00:25,483
I remember you said
you'd give me a set of wings.

3
00:00:31,406 --> 00:00:33,324
I want this partnership
to benefit both of us.

4
00:00:35,994 --> 00:00:38,079
Let me be more than a puzzle piece.

5
00:00:38,163 --> 00:00:40,582
Include me as part of the entire plan.

6
00:00:42,459 --> 00:00:44,836
Staying a puzzle piece may be easier.

7
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:47,255
Why don't we go ahead and admit

8
00:00:47,338 --> 00:00:49,591
that I've already spilled blood
for your sake.

9
00:00:50,341 --> 00:00:52,260
I may as well get something out of it.

10
00:00:54,429 --> 00:00:56,347
MS. RYU

11
00:01:01,686 --> 00:01:02,854
Hello, Ms. Ryu.

12
00:01:02,937 --> 00:01:03,938
Are you available to talk?

13
00:01:04,856 --> 00:01:07,734
Of course, Prosecutor.
How may I assist you?

14
00:01:07,817 --> 00:01:10,695
I have a ton of things
to take care of right now.

15
00:01:10,779 --> 00:01:12,322
May I ask you for a favor?

16
00:01:13,114 --> 00:01:15,325
Of course, I'm happy to help.

17
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:17,619
What can I do for you?

18
00:01:19,496 --> 00:01:22,749
I'll get back to you soon, bye. Thanks.

19
00:01:27,796 --> 00:01:29,380
You could've asked me for a favor.

20
00:01:29,881 --> 00:01:32,008
This is about Mr. Choi, isn't it, Ms. Min?

21
00:01:32,592 --> 00:01:35,220
Detective Jang, you already
have your hands full, don't you?

22
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:37,138
It's okay. I'll be fine.

23
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:20,390
GANGNAM B-SIDE

24
00:02:41,953 --> 00:02:43,163
Hey, Minseok.

25
00:02:47,917 --> 00:02:49,669
Are you hanging out with the cops, now?

26
00:02:52,422 --> 00:02:53,882
Did you not miss me?

27
00:02:55,425 --> 00:02:58,511
Not a day goes by without me
thinking about you.

28
00:02:58,595 --> 00:03:00,847
Yeah. Remember this?

29
00:03:03,641 --> 00:03:07,145
7 YEARS AGO
LUCKY ARCADE

30
00:03:10,815 --> 00:03:12,150
Well, look who it is.

31
00:03:12,233 --> 00:03:13,234
Oh!

32
00:03:13,318 --> 00:03:15,403
You fucking bastard. Piece of shit!

33
00:03:17,155 --> 00:03:19,449
You fucking ungrateful bastard.

34
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:22,368
Hey. If you've got a death wish,
just fucking tell me.

35
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:26,789
I fed you,
kept a fucking roof over your head,

36
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:28,708
and this is how you repay me, fucker?

37
00:03:32,378 --> 00:03:34,339
You fucking bastard!

38
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:39,135
We've got unfinished business
to settle.

39
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:41,679
I hear you've been looking for me, Gilho.

40
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:49,854
We should go.
We've got the stuff in the car.

41
00:03:50,772 --> 00:03:51,773
Let's go.

42
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:58,988
Think we should follow them?

43
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:00,198
Let them go.

44
00:04:00,782 --> 00:04:02,700
We'll cross paths again real soon.

45
00:04:13,586 --> 00:04:16,256
Those bastards took my daughter Yeseo.

46
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:18,091
Where did they go?

47
00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:19,759
What are you talking about?

48
00:04:19,842 --> 00:04:23,429
Yeseo… Yeseo is in your world now
trying to take revenge for Jaehee!

49
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:26,641
Oh.

50
00:04:29,644 --> 00:04:30,937
And so?

51
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:33,982
How does it feel?

52
00:04:36,067 --> 00:04:39,404
Now that your daughter is gone,
it's personal, isn't it?

53
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:41,656
What?

54
00:04:43,491 --> 00:04:49,831
Now you'll understand what it feels like
to lose someone you care about.

55
00:05:13,521 --> 00:05:14,522
I'm sorry.

56
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:17,150
I could've taken care of it,

57
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:20,820
but it didn't go as planned because
Yoon Gilho showed up all of a sudden.

58
00:05:20,903 --> 00:05:23,865
Those little rats
are annoyingly persistent.

59
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:28,870
Let's move up the timetable.

60
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:31,873
The trial period is almost over.

61
00:05:31,956 --> 00:05:33,166
Yes, sir.

62
00:05:33,249 --> 00:05:34,667
We'll get it done.

63
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:36,002
Get rid of both of them.

64
00:05:37,086 --> 00:05:38,588
Don't leave a single trace.

65
00:05:38,671 --> 00:05:39,672
Yes, sir.

66
00:05:49,557 --> 00:05:52,643
You know where Choi Suin is, don't you?
Huh?

67
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:01,402
MINHEE

68
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:05,782
Hey, are you up? How do you feel?

69
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:07,867
It's me, the chauffeur.

70
00:06:08,451 --> 00:06:10,036
Where did you take my daughter, Yeseo?

71
00:06:12,288 --> 00:06:13,998
I don't know what you're talking about.

72
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:16,918
Please do me a favor.

73
00:06:17,001 --> 00:06:18,419
Please let Yeseo go.

74
00:06:18,961 --> 00:06:20,588
That place is dangerous.

75
00:06:21,589 --> 00:06:25,885
All the girls here came
of their own accord, all right?

76
00:06:25,968 --> 00:06:27,804
Didn't you see it earlier?

77
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:31,057
She ignored you when you were
desperately crying out for her.

78
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:34,143
Then tell me why.
Why do you secretly help these girls?

79
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:35,895
You're worried about them too, right?

80
00:06:37,355 --> 00:06:39,315
It's none of your fucking business,
you asshole.

81
00:06:45,613 --> 00:06:47,824
Why are you mean to Suin?
What'd she do to you?

82
00:06:48,324 --> 00:06:50,576
She's just doing whatever that guy K says.

83
00:06:51,953 --> 00:06:53,037
-Ow!
-K?

84
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:54,414
What the hell? Let go.

85
00:06:54,497 --> 00:06:56,207
Where the hell is that one-eyed bastard?

86
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:57,917
-I don't know, okay?
-Tell me now!

87
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:03,589
You've heard
of Gangnam Trading Co., right?

88
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:04,674
No, I haven't, I--

89
00:07:04,757 --> 00:07:06,676
Tell me everything you know
about Gangnam Trading Co.!

90
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:08,010
Fuck's sake! That hurts!

91
00:07:37,623 --> 00:07:39,542
I guess maybe
I've seen him before.

92
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:41,169
The one-eyed bastard.

93
00:07:42,587 --> 00:07:47,592
I'm giving you plenty of this,
so share it with your friends.

94
00:07:48,551 --> 00:07:49,594
Okay?

95
00:07:49,677 --> 00:07:52,722
-Where did you see him?
-I mean, I can't remember that much.

96
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:54,348
I was high when I followed him there.

97
00:07:54,432 --> 00:07:55,433
Was it a club?

98
00:07:55,933 --> 00:07:58,478
Maybe. I think so?

99
00:07:58,561 --> 00:08:01,439
But I think it was empty and quiet there.

100
00:08:11,782 --> 00:08:15,036
Of course they wouldn't
leave that place alone. Bastards.

101
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:20,208
- Ta-da. Isn't it pretty?
- Wow. I love that!

102
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:22,043
I know, I think it's so cute.

103
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:27,256
- We could be twinsies.
- Where? I want one too.

104
00:08:39,268 --> 00:08:41,229
Why did you log into Jaehee's account?

105
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:44,315
I wanted to get in touch
with the people Jaehee knew

106
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:46,651
so that I could make some money like her.

107
00:08:46,734 --> 00:08:47,693
Jesus.

108
00:08:50,446 --> 00:08:52,198
Cut the bullshit and go home

109
00:08:52,281 --> 00:08:54,534
while you still have
someone who cares about you.

110
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:57,078
That man who showed up?

111
00:08:57,995 --> 00:08:59,038
That's your father, right?

112
00:09:00,331 --> 00:09:01,832
I heard he's a cop.

113
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:05,962
You know he's become a chauffeur
in this business just to track you down.

114
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:12,134
Forget about him and just find us a party.

115
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:15,513
Get us the most elite
VIP clientele possible.

116
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,101
Hey.

117
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:26,315
Tell me what your real reason is
for being here.

118
00:09:35,283 --> 00:09:38,411
NOTICE OF BUSINESS SUSPENSION

119
00:10:18,784 --> 00:10:20,620
I told you not to get in my way.

120
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:23,956
What are you doing here?

121
00:11:19,136 --> 00:11:20,638
How did you end up here?

122
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:23,724
Did you know those bastards were here too?

123
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:27,395
Hey.

124
00:11:27,478 --> 00:11:29,689
Don't you know you and I
want the same thing?

125
00:11:29,772 --> 00:11:32,983
We want to get K and that old fuck
who runs Gangnam Trading.

126
00:11:33,484 --> 00:11:35,986
You're here to get those bastards too,
aren't you?

127
00:11:38,906 --> 00:11:40,282
Choi Hakgu.

128
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:41,742
What?

129
00:11:41,826 --> 00:11:43,703
The old fuck who runs Gangnam Trading.

130
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:45,705
Yeah?

131
00:11:46,747 --> 00:11:49,458
Mr. Choi, that fucker's full name
is Choi Hakgu.

132
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:13,941
Motherfucker!

133
00:12:33,043 --> 00:12:34,503
Hey.

134
00:12:35,296 --> 00:12:36,464
Hey, Mr. Yoon.

135
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:41,218
Gilho.

136
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:43,596
What's up?

137
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:46,223
Are you still looking for
that bitch Jenny?

138
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:51,937
Hey, you fucking moron.

139
00:12:52,021 --> 00:12:54,315
Why you keep looking for a dead bitch?

140
00:12:54,398 --> 00:12:55,733
You motherfucker.

141
00:12:55,816 --> 00:12:56,984
- Stop!
- Get off me.

142
00:12:57,067 --> 00:12:59,320
-No, you can't kill him!
-Get the fuck off me!

143
00:13:00,654 --> 00:13:02,531
You fucking cockroach.

144
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:04,742
- Stop! Stop it!
- Whoo!

145
00:13:26,388 --> 00:13:27,723
Holy shit.

146
00:13:32,978 --> 00:13:35,272
Tell me what your real reason is
for being here.

147
00:13:47,368 --> 00:13:50,538
MY HEART

148
00:13:59,922 --> 00:14:02,049
Hey, what if we get caught?

149
00:14:02,132 --> 00:14:03,092
Just let me.

150
00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:04,927
It's so fucking strange.

151
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:14,186
I couldn't tell anyone,
in case they got in trouble too.

152
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:17,857
But if I'm gone…

153
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:19,733
PASSWORD FOR DOWNLOAD

154
00:14:19,817 --> 00:14:22,194
…I felt like someone
should do something about it.

155
00:14:23,195 --> 00:14:24,196
DOWNLOAD VIDEO

156
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:27,116
Please give this to your dad. Please.

157
00:14:28,325 --> 00:14:30,202
Hey, what if we get caught?

158
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:31,453
Just let me.

159
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:33,330
It's so fucking strange.

160
00:14:33,414 --> 00:14:35,749
Oh, no, I… What are you…
No, I'm good, yeah…

161
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:37,376
- Oh. You're good?
- Yeah.

162
00:14:37,459 --> 00:14:39,336
- No, I don't want to.
- Come on, damn it.

163
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:42,131
- You're paid for this, bitch.
- You can take me to them, right?

164
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:44,800
…may sting a little.

165
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:47,428
Yeah, and then what?

166
00:14:48,387 --> 00:14:50,598
What the hell will someone like you
be able to do?

167
00:14:52,099 --> 00:14:53,517
You planning to get revenge?

168
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:00,232
So I just sit back and watch?

169
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:01,734
And do nothing at all?

170
00:15:07,364 --> 00:15:08,532
I don't know anything.

171
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:10,701
I don't know anything.

172
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:15,372
Tell me everything.

173
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:18,834
Where's Choi Hakgu?

174
00:15:21,503 --> 00:15:25,382
We can do whatever we want,
if we just believe in ourselves.

175
00:15:27,217 --> 00:15:28,302
Both you and me.

176
00:15:30,971 --> 00:15:32,222
Hey, you put some on too.

177
00:15:32,806 --> 00:15:35,351
Who cares?

178
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:36,852
How are the new girls behaving?

179
00:15:43,734 --> 00:15:45,694
Are any of them acting up, or…

180
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:48,572
Of course not.

181
00:15:49,406 --> 00:15:51,116
They all know what they're getting into.

182
00:15:52,576 --> 00:15:53,619
How pretty.

183
00:15:53,702 --> 00:15:55,454
It looks so good on you.

184
00:16:20,604 --> 00:16:22,356
They need to change now, all right?

185
00:16:37,037 --> 00:16:38,706
Did you think I wouldn't notice?

186
00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:44,753
Get rid of the girls
who don't have the right look.

187
00:16:52,094 --> 00:16:53,095
Suin.

188
00:16:56,265 --> 00:16:57,808
Mr. Choi told me that

189
00:16:59,309 --> 00:17:01,645
once all of this is wrapped up nicely,

190
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:06,316
he'd put me in charge
of Gangnam, the entire district.

191
00:17:08,986 --> 00:17:11,155
So I need you on your A game.

192
00:17:12,614 --> 00:17:15,659
If you fuck this up
like you did last time with Kim Jaehee,

193
00:17:15,743 --> 00:17:18,704
I swear, I'm going to shred you to pieces.

194
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:20,622
Sir.

195
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:26,045
Psyche's on the phone. He said
he'd like to speak to you in private.

196
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,047
Give me the phone.

197
00:17:32,634 --> 00:17:33,761
What's up?

198
00:17:36,096 --> 00:17:39,475
Sorry, sir. Yoon Gilho broke into HYENA.

199
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:41,852
He's about to smash everything in here.

200
00:17:43,187 --> 00:17:46,523
He's finally arrived.
Yoon Gilho, that fucking rat.

201
00:17:48,984 --> 00:17:51,028
Did that cop show up too?

202
00:17:51,612 --> 00:17:54,198
Yes! So please, hurry.

203
00:17:54,698 --> 00:17:57,493
Those fuckers are
trying to take all our Neon.

204
00:17:58,952 --> 00:18:03,999
Get here quick, before these bastards
take all our drugs, okay?

205
00:18:12,299 --> 00:18:13,550
Are we good now?

206
00:18:14,551 --> 00:18:15,761
I'll get going, Mr. Yoon.

207
00:18:15,844 --> 00:18:17,221
See ya.

208
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:25,145
Sir, take a look…

209
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:35,405
Well, will you look at these rats?

210
00:18:36,907 --> 00:18:39,201
It's cute how they think
they can outsmart us.

211
00:18:57,636 --> 00:18:58,887
Did Jaehee have…

212
00:19:00,347 --> 00:19:02,474
a long-standing relationship
with that madam?

213
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:05,727
Yeah, for a while.

214
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:11,650
Before Jaehee started working with me…

215
00:19:13,944 --> 00:19:15,404
she worked a little for Suin.

216
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:16,905
She helped Jaehee sneak out.

217
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:24,496
TONIGHT, AT 1 A.M.

218
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:25,539
Hey.

219
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:28,542
Change of plans.

220
00:19:53,483 --> 00:19:54,818
Happy birthday.

221
00:19:55,444 --> 00:19:56,695
This is for you.

222
00:19:59,907 --> 00:20:01,241
You didn't need to.

223
00:20:02,409 --> 00:20:04,453
My birthday was a while ago, Dad.

224
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:07,581
Yeseo.

225
00:20:35,108 --> 00:20:36,318
So, are you ready?

226
00:21:02,177 --> 00:21:04,346
This bastard
had both of us fooled.

227
00:21:06,181 --> 00:21:07,641
There's a camera.

228
00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:12,354
Those fuckers have been
watching us the whole time.

229
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:19,945
Hello?

230
00:21:20,028 --> 00:21:21,405
Who's crazier?

231
00:21:22,823 --> 00:21:25,617
The daughter who walked into this business
to take revenge for her friend?

232
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:28,245
Or her dad who became a chauffeur
to find his daughter?

233
00:21:29,246 --> 00:21:30,664
Where are you right now?

234
00:21:31,164 --> 00:21:32,666
Are you still with Yeseo?

235
00:21:32,749 --> 00:21:35,002
She said exactly the same thing you said.

236
00:21:36,628 --> 00:21:38,255
You two really are family.

237
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:40,215
Do me a favor.

238
00:21:42,759 --> 00:21:45,804
Arrest all the girls here and in other
places and get them medical treatment.

239
00:21:49,683 --> 00:21:51,018
No matter how…

240
00:21:51,643 --> 00:21:52,811
how long it takes,

241
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:55,480
don't ever give up on those girls,

242
00:21:57,065 --> 00:21:58,734
so they're never abandoned again.

243
00:21:59,943 --> 00:22:00,944
I promise.

244
00:22:02,029 --> 00:22:03,071
I'd hurry,

245
00:22:03,947 --> 00:22:07,159
if you want your daughter
to avoid the same fate as Jaehee.

246
00:22:10,454 --> 00:22:11,872
Hello?

247
00:22:21,465 --> 00:22:24,634
375-114 NONHYEON-DONG
PENTHOUSE, OUTRAGE

248
00:22:25,385 --> 00:22:26,803
Hurry, you should go.

249
00:22:29,222 --> 00:22:30,307
What about you?

250
00:22:31,224 --> 00:22:32,684
Aren't you coming with me?

251
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:36,104
This place might be a trap.
Come with me and maybe together, we--

252
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:37,356
That's great.

253
00:22:38,899 --> 00:22:42,986
Dead or alive, I need to stay here
if I want to see them. Right?

254
00:22:44,654 --> 00:22:46,573
One of us has to risk his life here.

255
00:22:48,283 --> 00:22:49,785
Better me than you, am I right?

256
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:52,954
Go on, get out of here.

257
00:22:56,333 --> 00:22:57,501
Yeseo's waiting.

258
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:11,556
Stay alive, you idiot.

259
00:23:20,023 --> 00:23:21,400
Hey, come on. Move faster.

260
00:23:27,531 --> 00:23:29,783
I've been thinking about it. You're right.

261
00:23:30,659 --> 00:23:31,952
Before it's too late.

262
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,579
I'm going to take action.

263
00:23:36,498 --> 00:23:37,833
Come on, let's go.

264
00:24:36,266 --> 00:24:37,851
Su… Suin.

265
00:24:41,021 --> 00:24:42,522
Your dad's on his way, he's coming.

266
00:24:43,815 --> 00:24:45,025
You'll leave with him.

267
00:24:45,984 --> 00:24:48,278
While you still have someone
waiting for you.

268
00:24:52,073 --> 00:24:53,366
Everybody, sit down.

269
00:24:54,367 --> 00:24:56,828
We're not going to the party.
We're staying here.

270
00:25:10,634 --> 00:25:12,344
I hear you're not going to the event.

271
00:25:17,891 --> 00:25:19,184
Oh.

272
00:25:21,311 --> 00:25:23,188
Hang on, I know that face.

273
00:25:32,113 --> 00:25:33,490
We got Yoon Gilho.

274
00:25:33,573 --> 00:25:35,033
We're heading out now.

275
00:25:44,417 --> 00:25:46,836
I'm so very disappointed.

276
00:25:52,133 --> 00:25:54,844
I took you in
when you were just a whore on the street.

277
00:25:55,428 --> 00:25:58,223
I gave you food, shelter,
even let you make money.

278
00:25:58,306 --> 00:25:59,307
NO MESSAGE

279
00:26:01,935 --> 00:26:03,937
How dare you stab me in the back?

280
00:26:06,982 --> 00:26:08,650
You little shit.

281
00:26:11,278 --> 00:26:13,572
You'll always just be treading water.

282
00:26:14,781 --> 00:26:16,157
What?

283
00:26:16,241 --> 00:26:18,410
You'll forever feed on other people's shit

284
00:26:18,493 --> 00:26:21,913
until you die like a cockroach,
you fucking piece of scum.

285
00:26:26,209 --> 00:26:27,669
You just crossed the line.

286
00:26:28,795 --> 00:26:30,630
Goodbye, you fucking bitch.

287
00:26:34,467 --> 00:26:36,136
What are you doing? Get moving.

288
00:26:39,055 --> 00:26:40,557
Hey, Kang Yeseo.

289
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:43,935
Your dad know you're here?

290
00:26:46,229 --> 00:26:48,523
Three of you, to the front.
The rest go here.

291
00:26:52,068 --> 00:26:53,111
Get in the car.

292
00:27:01,328 --> 00:27:03,038
Are we done with the cleanup?

293
00:27:03,121 --> 00:27:04,456
We've got Yoon Gilho.

294
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,791
We don't have Kang Dongwoo yet,

295
00:27:08,209 --> 00:27:10,670
but we have someone even better.

296
00:27:12,672 --> 00:27:13,673
Bring her here.

297
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:56,341
Yeseo.

298
00:28:26,663 --> 00:28:27,664
Oh, my God.

299
00:28:28,206 --> 00:28:30,917
Are you okay? What happened?

300
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,669
Huh? Come on, Suin.

301
00:28:37,132 --> 00:28:38,633
Those motherfuckers.

302
00:28:41,678 --> 00:28:42,679
Bear…

303
00:28:42,762 --> 00:28:45,223
-What?
-Jaehee…

304
00:28:45,306 --> 00:28:46,683
What did you say?

305
00:28:46,766 --> 00:28:49,686
The video…

306
00:29:20,091 --> 00:29:22,093
If I don't make it through this…

307
00:29:24,512 --> 00:29:26,473
please give this to my dad.

308
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:29,559
Give it to him yourself, Yeseo.

309
00:29:29,642 --> 00:29:31,144
Please, Suin.

310
00:29:32,437 --> 00:29:33,938
And tell him that I'm sorry.

311
00:29:39,027 --> 00:29:40,612
MY HEART

312
00:29:40,695 --> 00:29:42,781
Hey, what if we get caught?

313
00:29:42,864 --> 00:29:43,907
Just let me.

314
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:45,533
It's so fucking strange.

315
00:29:45,617 --> 00:29:47,368
To bring us to a place like this.

316
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:49,913
The trials
are going all right, yeah?

317
00:29:49,996 --> 00:29:52,582
I saw on the news they're saying
these missing persons' cases

318
00:29:52,665 --> 00:29:53,958
in Gangnam are all linked.

319
00:29:54,459 --> 00:29:56,336
You don't think we should be worried,
do you?

320
00:29:56,419 --> 00:29:59,380
After all the money spent on it,
it'd better be successful.

321
00:29:59,464 --> 00:30:01,508
The subjects signed the waiver
acknowledging the risks

322
00:30:01,591 --> 00:30:02,759
to their well-being.

323
00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:04,886
I mean, we're actually helping

324
00:30:04,969 --> 00:30:07,680
all those good-for-nothing people
be more useful.

325
00:30:07,764 --> 00:30:08,890
Right?

326
00:30:09,891 --> 00:30:12,811
There shouldn't even be any issues
for us to worry about.

327
00:30:12,894 --> 00:30:14,354
That's why you're here now.

328
00:30:15,146 --> 00:30:18,566
By the way, do the detox meds
actually work?

329
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:20,109
I still have my doubts.

330
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:23,947
If you can't trust me,
why don't you try it yourself?

331
00:30:24,781 --> 00:30:27,116
The urine test will be completely clean.

332
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:35,250
All right, then.
Let's give it a try.

333
00:30:37,043 --> 00:30:38,753
- Hey, you. Come here.
- What?

334
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:41,714
Oh, no, I… What are you…
No, I'm good, yeah…

335
00:30:41,798 --> 00:30:44,050
- Oh. You're good?
- Yeah, I'm good. No,

336
00:30:44,133 --> 00:30:45,510
-I don't want to.
-Damn it.

337
00:30:45,593 --> 00:30:48,179
You're paid for this, bitch.
Now shut up and get to work.

338
00:30:48,263 --> 00:30:50,223
It may sting a little.

339
00:30:50,306 --> 00:30:52,725
-Do what you're paid to do.
-Don't worry about it, baby.

340
00:30:52,809 --> 00:30:56,104
Time to work. There you go. Okay.

341
00:30:56,604 --> 00:30:59,732
Huh?

342
00:31:00,316 --> 00:31:02,026
You like that, don't you?

343
00:31:03,611 --> 00:31:05,029
There, there.

344
00:31:05,822 --> 00:31:07,323
All right, all right.

345
00:31:07,407 --> 00:31:09,367
- Here we go. Okay?
- Okay.

346
00:31:09,909 --> 00:31:10,910
Okay.

347
00:31:10,994 --> 00:31:12,036
Hey, come here.

348
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:13,830
All right, all right…

349
00:31:13,913 --> 00:31:16,666
- There.
- Here it goes. There, there.

350
00:31:23,631 --> 00:31:25,800
Captain Kang, where are you?
What happened to you?

351
00:31:25,884 --> 00:31:27,051
I'm gonna send you a video.

352
00:31:27,135 --> 00:31:29,596
Send it to forensics,
expedite the analysis.

353
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:30,847
Yeseo…

354
00:31:31,347 --> 00:31:34,309
went to a VIP party hosted by
Gangnam Trading Co.

355
00:31:34,392 --> 00:31:37,186
And those perverted fuckers
tested drugs on the girls there.

356
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:38,730
There might be a lead in the video.

357
00:31:38,813 --> 00:31:41,733
They talk about some kind of trials
and inject each other.

358
00:31:43,359 --> 00:31:44,569
Like, you mean, clinical trials?

359
00:31:45,403 --> 00:31:46,613
What? You know something?

360
00:31:46,696 --> 00:31:49,365
Prosecutor Min's been strange lately.

361
00:31:49,949 --> 00:31:52,285
So I asked Jangho to put a tail on her.

362
00:31:53,328 --> 00:31:54,621
Hang on a second.

363
00:31:55,997 --> 00:31:56,998
What?

364
00:31:58,541 --> 00:32:00,084
I just sent you a photo.

365
00:32:09,385 --> 00:32:12,639
At the time, I wondered why she was
going to a biopharmaceutical company.

366
00:32:12,722 --> 00:32:14,724
I couldn't make the connection,
but now it makes sense.

367
00:32:14,807 --> 00:32:15,808
HAE IL BIOPHARMACEUTICAL

368
00:32:21,481 --> 00:32:23,650
UNIT 405, SEOCHO UNYANG BUILDING

369
00:32:44,379 --> 00:32:45,505
You can come in.

370
00:32:45,588 --> 00:32:47,507
Prosecutor Min gave me a heads-up already.

371
00:32:58,309 --> 00:33:00,979
So, after Noh Joonseo's death,

372
00:33:02,313 --> 00:33:04,983
Prosecutor Min told me
she was going to play the long game,

373
00:33:05,066 --> 00:33:07,193
and asked if I would join her.

374
00:33:07,276 --> 00:33:09,654
DISTRIBUTION PLAN

HAE IL BIO MEDICINE SUPPLY

376
00:33:16,452 --> 00:33:18,496
HI PHARMA, VICE MINISTER LEE,
MAYOR WOO JOIN HANDS

377
00:33:22,083 --> 00:33:26,629
So… Prosecutor Min, where is she?

378
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:29,549
MS. RYU

379
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:35,680
Hello, Ms. Ryu.

380
00:33:35,763 --> 00:33:37,015
It's me.

381
00:33:38,266 --> 00:33:39,726
Jaehee's video…

382
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:42,020
I have it.

383
00:33:43,771 --> 00:33:47,817
And I'll give it to you
if you promise me one thing.

384
00:33:54,741 --> 00:33:56,200
My daughter Yeseo is there.

385
00:33:57,118 --> 00:33:59,245
Please, could you just…

386
00:34:00,705 --> 00:34:02,457
hold off until I get there?

387
00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:10,983
Yes, I had hoped you could.

388
00:35:11,067 --> 00:35:13,194
-Of course, I'd be happy to.
-Well, fantastic, then.

389
00:35:16,697 --> 00:35:20,201
Oh, my. The most important person
is finally here.

390
00:35:20,284 --> 00:35:22,411
None of you have met her before, right?

391
00:35:23,162 --> 00:35:26,874
This is Prosecutor Min Seojin
from the Supreme Prosecutors' Office.

392
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:31,003
Well, why don't we all greet each other?

393
00:35:31,087 --> 00:35:33,422
- It's great to meet you.
- She seems respectable.

394
00:35:33,506 --> 00:35:34,799
Ah, welcome.

395
00:35:59,448 --> 00:36:02,034
-Hello, you're here.
-Hello, Mr. Choi.

396
00:36:03,578 --> 00:36:05,997
-Mr. Choi, it's a pleasure.
-Assemblyman Kim.

397
00:36:06,497 --> 00:36:08,833
-I've been looking forward to seeing this.
-Good to hear.

398
00:36:08,916 --> 00:36:10,001
Today's the day.

399
00:36:10,084 --> 00:36:11,294
It sure is.

400
00:36:12,587 --> 00:36:13,588
Sir.

401
00:36:14,505 --> 00:36:16,424
-Hello, Mayor Woo.
-Sir, good to see you.

402
00:36:16,507 --> 00:36:19,260
Well, now that Mr. Choi has arrived,
let's have a drink! Yeah?

403
00:36:19,343 --> 00:36:21,137
-Oh, let's do it!
-Yes.

404
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:22,930
-Cheers.
-Cheers!

405
00:36:23,598 --> 00:36:25,266
Uh, wait.

406
00:36:26,475 --> 00:36:28,186
Someone's not here yet, hold on.

407
00:36:51,667 --> 00:36:53,252
What's everybody looking at?

408
00:36:53,753 --> 00:36:55,880
Am I not supposed to be here? Huh?

409
00:37:00,134 --> 00:37:02,220
Secretary Tak.

410
00:37:02,303 --> 00:37:04,889
I saw the news,
so I assumed you couldn't make it.

411
00:37:04,972 --> 00:37:06,891
Is the investigation over already?

412
00:37:06,974 --> 00:37:10,019
Of course, it was over quickly.
It's all formality anyway.

413
00:37:10,102 --> 00:37:11,103
Of course.

414
00:37:11,187 --> 00:37:13,105
Isn't that true, Mayor Woo?

415
00:37:13,189 --> 00:37:15,358
Oh, y-yes that's right, Secretary Tak.

416
00:37:19,946 --> 00:37:20,947
What is this?

417
00:37:23,741 --> 00:37:25,952
The seat of the Minister of Justice
will soon be vacant.

418
00:37:26,994 --> 00:37:29,330
Upon his acquittal,
Secretary Tak will take up the position.

419
00:37:29,413 --> 00:37:32,250
Well.

420
00:37:35,461 --> 00:37:37,004
So it was just a test?

421
00:37:40,841 --> 00:37:42,426
It was for all our sakes, Prosecutor.

422
00:37:43,511 --> 00:37:46,180
You said you wanted to be part
of the entire plan.

423
00:37:50,059 --> 00:37:51,769
I told you.

424
00:37:53,229 --> 00:37:55,731
No matter what,
you'll always be my underling.

425
00:37:57,525 --> 00:37:58,776
Good to see you again.

426
00:38:04,907 --> 00:38:08,327
All right. Let's get started.

427
00:38:16,085 --> 00:38:19,630
It's a foolproof contract, reviewed
by an attorney and a working prosecutor.

428
00:38:22,925 --> 00:38:25,177
You did work out the side effects
of the meds though, right?

429
00:38:25,761 --> 00:38:27,430
Not that I don't trust you.

430
00:38:29,473 --> 00:38:32,476
Well, why don't you
see for yourself, then?

431
00:38:48,617 --> 00:38:50,077
What are you planning to do?

432
00:38:50,995 --> 00:38:53,122
I will save those who must live

433
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:56,042
and kill those who must die.
