00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:47,720

(Monitor)

00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,520

My back is about to break.

00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:44,680
Alright, be careful.

31
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,120
Don't fall down.

32
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:55,720
Sorry about that.

33
00:02:57,860 --> 00:02:58,800
Don't move.

34
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:00,680
Listen up,

35
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:01,820
do as I say

36
00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:03,800
and no one will get hurt.

37
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,560
What do you want?

38
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,820
Take me to the finance office

39
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:08,640
and give me 500,000 yuan in cash.

40
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:10,240
If you dare lie to me,

41
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:12,840
I'll shoot you dead.

42
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:15,800
Young man,

43
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,600
500,000 in cash?

44
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:19,560
Everything is digital now.

45
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:20,920
This supermarket

46
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:22,360
doesn't keep that kind of cash.

47
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:25,080
Doesn't a model team get selected monthly

48
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,720
with bonuses distributed to everyone?

49
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,360
When it's payday,

50
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:30,520
the bonuses are given in red envelopes

51
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,800
in cash, to each model employee.

52
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,520
Tomorrow is payday.

53
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,320
You must have prepared it already,

54
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:39,560
so I know you've got cash here.

55
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,760
Now that I'm here,

56
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,960
I'm not leaving empty-handed, okay?

57
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:48,000
How do you know so much about this?

58
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:50,240
No, no.

59
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:53,400
Didn't I already tell you?

60
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,520
Do what I say

61
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:56,680
and no one gets hurt.

62
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,440
Why did you lie to me?

63
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:01,320
- I didn't! I swear!
- You lied.

64
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,560
Lying makes me angry.

65
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:06,080
And if I'm angry, someone will die, got it?

66
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:09,720
I understand.

67
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,560
What matters more, money or life?

68
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,280
Think carefully, okay?

69
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,360
I will, I will.

70
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:17,920
I will.

71
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,120
Manager Zhou,

72
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,480
what's the matter?

73
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:51,240
Hu,

74
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,600
put... put the cash

75
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,240
in the bag.

76
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:08,480
Cash?

77
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:09,880
What cash?

78
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,560
The cash for the red envelopes!

79
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,440
Red envelopes? But...

80
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,240
Are you even listening to me?

81
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:18,880
Do you understand?

82
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:20,880
Cash!

83
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,600
Alright, alright, Manager!

84
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,840
I'll do it now, don't get mad!

85
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,720
Open the safe!

86
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,520
Open it, open it!

87
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,520
- Okay, okay.
- Open the safe!

88
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:38,600
There's no cash.

89
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,520
Really, no cash.

90
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:40,920
To motivate the staff,

91
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:43,840
we've already gave them
the red envelopes early.

92
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:05,240
Mom!

93
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,670

94
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:12,160
Mom! Mom!

95
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,680
Everyone get down!

96
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:23,880
Take cover!

97
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:26,640
Move!

98
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:28,110
Where? Where to?

99
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:29,680
Hurry up!

100
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,640
Move!

101
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:31,600
The keys!

102
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,560
What keys?

103
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,680
To the door! Hurry!

104
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:34,520
Where are they?

105
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:37,520
Police! Help! Help! Help!

106
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:38,480

(Binjiang Armed Patrol)

109
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,320
Any surveillance of the suspect?

110
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,480
No.

111
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,760
Security linked to the police station

112
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:48,280
was deliberately cut off.

113
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:50,760
Cameras and phones are disabled too.

114
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:52,360
Looks like it was well planned.

115
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,880
He's probably experienced

116
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,120
to act alone like this.

117
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:58,640
Most troubling is that he's armed.

(Binjiang Armed Patrol)

119
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,160
Don't move!

120
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,480
Tell them

121
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,440
what they should do.

122
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,760
Don't move! Don't move!

123
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:13,960

(Hummer Commandos)

129

Tata, find a sniper position.

130
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,160
Got it.

131
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,400
Everyone else, follow me.

132
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:54,320
You wouldn't believe me anyway.

133
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:55,760
Shut up!

134
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,560
Why didn't you tell me?

135
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,760
There's no money in the safe.

136
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,200
I told you, I told you!

137
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,280
- Relax.
- You didn't trust me.

138
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,680
Don't hurt innocent people.

139
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,640
We can talk about your demands.

- Shut up!
- If you...

143
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,200
I don't care who you are.

144
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,720
Listen up!

145
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,320
In two hours,

146
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,360
I want you to prepare

147
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:20,040
500,000 yuan in cash,

148
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,680
with no sequential serial numbers.

149
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:22,920
Did you hear me?

150
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,560
500,000 is a big sum,

151
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,640
and it has to be in cash.

152
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,840
Two hours isn't enough.

153
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:28,930
Even with police help,

154
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:29,960
it won't get it that fast.

155
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:32,500
Figure out the situation.

156
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,280
You don't have the right

157
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:36,920
to negotiate with me, got it?

158
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,160
Look here!

159
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:40,280
One, two, three, four, five, six,

160
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,440
seven!

161
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,200
Seven people!

162
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:44,560
If you don't care

163
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,040
whether they live or die,

164
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:47,800
fine!

165
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,760
Keep stalling!

166
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,120
Don't be so worked up.

167
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,560
I'm here to

168
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:54,240
listen to your demands.

169
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:56,680
Whatever it is,

170
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,360
we can talk it out.

171
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,680
Just don't hurt the hostages.

172
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:02,640
That depends on how well you cooperate.

173
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,080
Now listen carefully!

174
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,280
I need a car.

175
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,800
Fill it up with petrol.

176
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,640
And park it at the supermarket entrance,
engine running.

177
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:13,840
Also,

178
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,720
tell your people

179
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,680
to evacuate through the rear exit.

180
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,720
Once I get the money,

181
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:21,320
I'll only take him with me.

182
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,720
The rest will be released.

183
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:24,800
Is that clear?

184
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:28,040
Two hours is really too short.

185
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,640
One minute late,

186
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,560
and we die together.

187
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,960
Did you hear me?

188
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,360
Calm down first.

189
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,400
We'll do our best to meet your demands.

190
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:44,120
Just ensure the hostages are safe.

191
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:48,780
(Main Entrance for Customers)

192
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,400
This road gets jammed a lot.

193
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,200
He won't escape by car.

194
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:55,480
There's a metro station
200 meters from here.

195
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,400
He can drive to the station.

196
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:59,120
To use the hostage as cover,

197
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,200
then he gets on the subway.

198
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,960
So the car is just a decoy

199
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,920
to draw away us.

200
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,400
His real target is the metro station.

201
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,920
He won't escape from the metro either.

202
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,560
He won't even get inside.

203
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:13,720
His plan looks calculated,

204
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,120
but it won't work at all.

205
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:18,440
Are the money and car ready or not?

206
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,640
He's not as experienced as we thought.

207
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,360
He's trying to act professional,

208
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,840
but it's overdone.

209
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:29,000
Captain, you can tell that?

210
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,200
So far,

211
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,120
none of the hostages have been harmed.

212
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,600
That proves

213
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,720
he's not a professional criminal.

214
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:40,240
We've passed your request
to the superiors.

215
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:42,000
We're taking it seriously.

216
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,040
Now,

217
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:45,490
can you show some sincerity too?

218
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,840
What do you mean?

219
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,400
You want me to release a hostage?

220
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:53,040
Do you think I'm that stupid?

221
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,280
No, you're not stupid at all.

222
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:56,880
You're very professional.

223
00:10:58,470 --> 00:10:59,480
I think

224
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:00,960
you've planned this all out.

225
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:03,080
And our response

226
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,040
is all standard procedure, right?

227
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,320
Good that you know.

228
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:07,680
I guess

229
00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:10,120
once you get the car and money,

230
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,840
you'll escape via the subway.

231
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:14,440
Am I right?

232
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,400
So I'm telling you,

233
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,080
you don't have any other choice!

234
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,880
If I get away,

235
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:23,840
you'll still have a chance to catch me.

236
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:28,280
But if I don't get
the money in two hours,

237
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:29,960
they will

238
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,120
all die!

239
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,400
You're very confident.

240
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,800
Of course I have to

241
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:41,920
plan such a big thing

242
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,120
carefully.

243
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,440
You're right.

244
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:45,840
Young man,

245
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:48,040
you're already surrounded.

246
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,680
There's no way out.

247
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:51,840
Shut up.

248
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,280
I'm warning you all!

249
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,400
No more tricks!

250
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,640
Only two hours!

251
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:02,000
One penny short,

252
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:04,840
and we'll all die together!

253
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:12,560
Li,

254
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:13,920
are you feeling unwell?

255
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,880
I need to use the toilet.

256
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:19,840
Young man,

257
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:22,080
it's been a long time.

258
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,320
We all need to go to the toilet.

259
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:25,920
So what?

260
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,480
We're all human

261
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:30,720
with dignity.

262
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,760
You can't make us go on the floor.

263
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:35,480
Zhou Tianshui,

264
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,640
anyone can talk to me about dignity,

265
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:40,440
except you.

266
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,200
You better figure this out

267
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,400
who's being stepped on here?

268
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,240
Me or you?

269
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:49,880
You... You...

270
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:52,120
Do you know me?

271
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:53,480
One more word!

272
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:57,160
I won't, I won't, I swear!

273
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:58,400
Mom.

274
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,920
I want some water.

275
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:02,960
The child is thirsty.

276
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:03,920
Shut up!

277
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,040
I won't say anything!

278
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:10,720
Ma'am,

279
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:12,400
are you okay?

280
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:14,760
I think she's having a heart attack.

281
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:15,800
Young man.

282
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,840
Shut up!

283
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,040
I'm in charge here!

284
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:19,960
Shut up!

285
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,840
What if she dies from a heart attack?

286
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:23,200
Shut up!

287
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:24,400
Shut up!

288
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:25,960
I'll stop, I'll stop!

289
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:31,680
Move forward.

290
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,800
Slowly.

291
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:41,400
She should have medicine on her.

292
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:42,800
Ask her where it is.

293
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,200
- Quick!
- Where's the medicine?

294
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:46,160
Where is it?

295
00:13:51,550 --> 00:13:52,640
This one?

296
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:55,730
Are you stupid?

297
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:57,600
Get some water!

298
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:58,580
Water, water!

299
00:14:10,430 --> 00:14:11,720
- Ma'am.
- You'll be fine now.

300
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,200
Feeling better?

301
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,440
She should be okay now.

302
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:22,680
Run!

303
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,270
- Run!
- Run!

304
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:25,280
Hurry!

305
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:26,560
- Go!
- Go!

306
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,160
Run!

307
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:32,840
Freeze!

308
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:34,080
Don't move!

309
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,400
Don't move!

310
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,400
Help me!

311
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:38,440
Help me!

312
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,080
Don't move! Stay still!

313
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,440
Step back!

314
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,240
Calm down. Don't hurt the hostage.

315
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:45,160
- Don't move!
- We're getting your money ready.

316
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:49,760
How about

317
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:50,960
you let Manager Zhou go?

318
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,520
I'll go with you.

319
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,440
I'm a woman.

320
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,240
It's easier to control, right?

321
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:58,370
I only want him!

322
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,760
Back off.

323
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:07,760
Captain.

324
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,040
There's an obstacle.

325
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:09,960
I lost the target.

326
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,240
Captain,

327
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,360
the gun is fake.

328
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:30,720
Mai,

329
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:32,040
check if surveillance is back.

330
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:32,960
Yes.

331
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:34,100
- Danyang stays.
- Yes.

332
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:36,640
I'll fight you to the end!

333
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,040
Why is it you?

334
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,520
The surveillance is back online.

335
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56,160
Isn't that Yuan?

336
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:58,800
You know him?

337
00:15:58,800 --> 00:15:59,640
Yes.

338
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:00,640
His name is Yuan Bin,

339
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:02,240
used to work in our finance department.

340
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,160
He quit?

341
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,640
He was fired by Manager Zhou
six months ago.

342
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,520
Yuan Bin, 26 years old,

343
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:10,640
convicted of theft at age 15,

344
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:12,240
spent one year in juvenile correction.

345
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,330
He taught himself to get
an accounting certificate.

346
00:16:14,330 --> 00:16:15,180
Records show he has

347
00:16:15,190 --> 00:16:16,620
(Police Dispatch)
a two-year finance role

348
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:17,640
at Jipincang Supermarket.

349
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:18,800
He was fired six months ago

350
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:19,840
and has been jobless since.

351
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:21,880
Zhou Tianshui.

352
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:25,880
You ruined me.

353
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,920
I didn't! I didn't!

354
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:30,840
Why

355
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,200
did you always target me?

356
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:38,360
Why did you always target me?

357
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,840
I don't know what you think

358
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:43,200
about this month's sales performance.

359
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:50,480
Yuan Bin.

360
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:53,040
Don't you know the company rules?

361
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:55,240
My family had some issues recently.

362
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:56,800
Only your family has problems?

363
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:57,760
Only yours is special?

364
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:58,800
It's happened several times.

365
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,120
Your bonus this month is docked.

366
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:01,600
Yuan Bin.

367
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,720
Please, let me go.

368
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:04,680
While you still can,

369
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:05,760
turn yourself in now.

370
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:09,280
From now on,

371
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:10,640
you shut up.

372
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:13,480
Got it?

373
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:15,760
Got it.

374
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:19,920
I really didn't expect it
to be Yuan Bin.

375
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:21,520
What was he like before?

376
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:22,760
I joined later,

377
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:24,120
so I don't know him well.

378
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:26,400
He was quiet,

379
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,760
but hardworking.

380
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,520
He was just a bit withdrawn.

381
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:33,840
Our performance
hasn't been great these years.

382
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,040
Last year Manager Zhou came,

383
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:36,320
and said to downsize

384
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:37,520
to cut costs.

385
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:39,440
That's why there were layoffs.

386
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,880
What do you all think of Manager Zhou?

387
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:45,640
Manager Zhou's strict,

388
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,040
but very capable.

389
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:49,800
Our performance has improved a lot.

390
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,200
You're being too euphemistic.

391
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:54,600
He has no compassion.

392
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:56,040
We call him "Slave Driver".

393
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:57,040
Am I right?

394
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:57,960
Yes.

395
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,640
Before he came,
the performance was poor,

396
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:02,680
but at least we got along.

397
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:03,760
After he came,

398
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:06,440
he started some
reward competition scheme,

399
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:08,830
and made us all fight like roosters.

400
00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:10,040
No one dared to take leave.

401
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:11,760
Even five minutes late was a big deal.

402
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,720
Why was Yuan Bin fired?

403
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,280
I heard

404
00:18:15,530 --> 00:18:17,520
he came out of a juvenile center.

405
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,160
Maybe that's why.

406
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,120
So it's true?

407
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,600
What do you mean "true"?

408
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,300
Of course that's why.

409
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:28,000
Zhou Tianshui can't tolerate flaws.

410
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,320
This Zhou Tianshui

411
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:33,880
was so harsh on staff.

412
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:35,540
Is it possible that

413
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:37,760
he fired Yuan Bin

414
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:39,040
for having a record?

415
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:41,000
Isn't Manager Zhou in real danger now?

416
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,080
Zhou Tianshui,

417
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,960
why aren't you so arrogant now?

418
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:57,920
You never thought

419
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:01,120
that you'd end up like this, right?

420
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:05,400
Yuan Bin.

421
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:08,600
What exactly are you trying to do?

422
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:10,120
I'm Ye Zhen.

423
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,040
Can you hear me,

424
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:12,960
Yuan Bin?

425
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:14,920
Don't be nervous.

426
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,920
I've read your file.

427
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,400
To be honest,

428
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:19,560
I felt relieved.

429
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:22,880
You're not a heinous criminal.

430
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:25,520
You're just upset

431
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:26,800
about being fired,

432
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28,160
and want revenge.

433
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,080
You don't want to hurt anyone,

434
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:31,360
right?

435
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:32,440
(Supermarket Warehouse)

436
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:34,720
Stop underestimating me, okay?

437
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:38,120
Stop analyzing me!

438
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:39,360
My money

439
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:41,160
and the car!

440
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:42,920
Are they ready?

441
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:44,680
I'm not underestimating you.

442
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,520
I just want you to know

443
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:48,320
the gun is fake,

444
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:50,120
and no one's been hurt.

445
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:52,720
That works in your favor.

446
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,720
But your people came in.

447
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:59,140
I don't trust you anymore.

448
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,920
There was still over an hour,

449
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,720
(Supermarket Warehouse)
but now I'm upset.

450
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:08,240
You've got half an hour left!

451
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,520
Did you hear that?

452
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,360
Half an hour is too short.

453
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,120
It's too short.

454
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:18,920
Half an hour is too short.

455
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,760
Too short?

456
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:24,400
If you're venting,

457
00:20:24,410 --> 00:20:26,320
- Ouch!
- you've made your point.

458
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:27,460
I think Manager Zhou

459
00:20:27,470 --> 00:20:29,200
fully understands how you feel now.

460
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,440
Okay, I promise you.

461
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,520
Help!

462
00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:34,120
Captain.

463
00:20:34,130 --> 00:20:35,400
Yuan Bin is losing control.

464
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:36,780
What do we do now?

465
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,400
Luo,

466
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:42,960
contact Yuan Bin's mother for me.

467
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48,120
Yuan Bin,

468
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,720
you can't do this.

469
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:54,160
This will really get you into trouble.

470
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:56,120
I'm not afraid of anything now.

471
00:20:57,610 --> 00:20:58,560
Getting into trouble?

472
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:01,720
Even less afraid.

473
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:04,760
Didn't you always think

474
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:07,840
I was beyond saving?

475
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:10,320
I never thought that.

476
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:12,560
Zhou Tianshui,

477
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:16,160
think about what you did to me before.

478
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,680
Whatever I do to you today

479
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:21,160
isn't too much, is it?

480
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,200
I...

481
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:25,080
What did I ever do to you?

482
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,240
Have you ever thought

483
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,000
why he treated you that way?

484
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,320
Why?

485
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:41,960
Because

486
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:44,680
he knew

487
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:47,160
that when I was a kid,

488
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,680
I was in juvenile detention.

489
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:54,560
(Supermarket Warehouse)
So he always had it out for me.

490
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,160
Given the chance,

491
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,400
he'd fire me.

492
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,480
Juvenile detention?

493
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,840
I didn't know about that.

494
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:08,400
How would I know

495
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:09,680
about your childhood?

496
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:11,680
Stop pretending, will you?

497
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:15,000
It's all there,

498
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,800
written in my file.

499
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:22,720
So all I ever wanted

500
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:26,440
was to work hard,

501
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,280
without saying one more word.

502
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:32,600
I told myself

503
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,440
to work hard

504
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:38,000
and make all of you managers

505
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,040
(Supermarket Warehouse)

506
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:41,320
forget about my past mistakes.

507
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:44,840
I did everything

508
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:47,080
I should do

509
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:49,880
around you.

510
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:52,120
Even things I shouldn't,

511
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,120
I still tried my best.

512
00:22:58,490 --> 00:22:59,570
But why

513
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,880
did you still fire me?

514
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:08,160
I really didn't know
you were in juvenile detention.

515
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:10,280
Please, believe me.

516
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:12,480
I truly didn't know.

517
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,220
(Supermarket Warehouse)

518
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:15,200
Yuan Bin.

519
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,080
Aren't you overthinking this?

520
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:22,440
Mistakes from your youth are long past.

521
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:24,320
You don't have to dwell on them.

522
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:30,440
You tell Captain Ye,

523
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,160
why was I fired?

524
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:36,320
Who to keep and who to let go

525
00:23:36,770 --> 00:23:38,680
was decided by the head office.

526
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:40,520
I was just following orders.

527
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:42,040
Captain Ye!

528
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,480
Did you hear that?

529
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:47,600
Even now,

530
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:49,200
this guy

531
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:52,200
(Supermarket Warehouse)
is still shifting all the blame!

532
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,920
I'm not shifting anything!

533
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,880
I really am not.

534
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:56,920
Yuan Bin,

535
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:58,200
to be fair,

536
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:59,800
I can't take sides.

537
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:02,080
But have you thought

538
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:04,480
that Zhou Tianshui

539
00:24:04,930 --> 00:24:06,680
is just a store manager?

540
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:08,480
He has bosses too,

541
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,240
and his own struggles.

542
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:20,480
He makes so much money.

543
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,480
- I...
- Can someone like you

544
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:25,400
understand people like us

545
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:26,880
who can't even afford

546
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,040
hospital bills?

547
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:29,800
What money have I made?

548
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:31,920
Have I made any at all?

549
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:34,760
If I had, would I be in this state?

550
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,120
Everyone has their difficulties.

551
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:38,760
Yuan Bin,

552
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:40,680
do you really know him?

553
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:43,680
Do you know why he did what he did?

554
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,720
I don't care

555
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:48,280
what kind of person he is.

556
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:51,640
All I know is

557
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:54,960
I ended up like this today

558
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:01,080
because of him.

559
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:06,680
(Supermarket Warehouse)
Why do you keep saying it's my fault?

560
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:09,920
All I ever wanted was to do my job well.

561
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,840
I have no personal grudge against you.

562
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,520
Why blame me for your crimes?

563
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,480
You think my life is easy?

564
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:21,200
You all say behind my back
that I'm harsh

565
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,640
and heartless.

566
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:25,160
I know you called me "Slave Driver".

567
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,240
Have I ever said a word back?

568
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,760
I'm always first to arrive,

569
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,280
last to leave.

570
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:33,080
Did anyone see that?

571
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:34,880
Do any of you know

572
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:36,840
what I've given?

573
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:39,800
When I first came here,

574
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:43,840
the head office had already
decided to shut us down.

575
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:45,480
Do you know what that means?

576
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:46,880
It means

577
00:25:47,090 --> 00:25:48,680
everyone would be out of a job.

578
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:51,620
32 people, including myself.

579
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:54,400
So I pushed everyone to work harder

580
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:57,080
because that's the only way
to keep our jobs.

581
00:25:57,460 --> 00:25:59,550
I'm 47 years old this year.

582
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:02,320
I've never fought this hard in my life.

583
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:07,480
Then why did you ruin my job?

584
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:09,360
I really tried my best.

585
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,200
I truly did.

586
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:14,910
Later, the head office sent inspectors.

587
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:16,880
They gave us a verdict

588
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:19,320
to let go at least five people.

589
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:21,800
Only then could we
keep the store running.

590
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:24,440
I'm sorry, you were one of them.

591
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:26,360
But

592
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:28,310
I honestly didn't know

593
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,120
about your past.

594
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:37,160
I'm sorry.

595
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,400
I only focused on

596
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:40,960
doing my job well,

597
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,840
and neglected how you all felt.

598
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:44,760
I deserve this, okay?

599
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:46,640
I deserve it.

600
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,440
Just kill me.

601
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:02,240
Captain Ye, we found

602
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:04,100
Yuan Bin's mother, Chen Lijun, has

603
00:27:04,110 --> 00:27:05,360
severe kidney failure.

604
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:08,200
She's currently hospitalized
at Second People's Hospital.

605
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,120
Yuan Bin's mother

606
00:27:10,130 --> 00:27:12,040
still has unpaid medical bills.

607
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:21,000
Yuan Bin,

608
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:23,760
I want to confirm something with you.

609
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:27,200
Your mother, Chen Lijun,

610
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,480
has severe kidney disease.

611
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,400
Her life is in danger.

612
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:32,360
She urgently needs expensive treatment

613
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:33,800
to stay alive.

614
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:37,800
That's why you wanted 500,000,

615
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:39,280
right?

616
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:45,320
My mom

617
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:47,520
is the only one in this world

618
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:50,120
who still believes in me.

619
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:53,160
I can't just sit back and watch her

620
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:54,080
leave like this.

621
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,320
You're a filial son.

622
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:58,040
You care about your mother.

623
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:01,640
If it weren't for this situation,

624
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:04,360
you wouldn't have made this choice.

625
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:06,880
Actually,

626
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:11,240
I already found a bookkeeping job.

627
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:13,440
But later...

628
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:16,920
Later,

629
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:21,920
they found out I had been fired

630
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:25,480
and let me go again.

631
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:29,520
Every time,

632
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:32,340
(Supermarket Warehouse)

633
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:33,720
it's the same.

634
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:38,000
In

635
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:39,800
this world,

636
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:44,160
no one is willing to trust me anymore.

637
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:47,120
No one gives me another chance.

638
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:49,200
Yuan Bin,

639
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:50,960
we understand your situation.

640
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:53,320
Let us help you, alright?

641
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:57,360
Can you give me that 500,000?

642
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:01,960
500,000 really isn't that much.

643
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:04,760
It'll be gone in a few treatments.

644
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,400
I am my mother's

645
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:13,640
only son in this world.

646
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:19,520
I have to do something for her.

647
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:23,000
But your road ahead is long.

648
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:25,960
There's still so much
you can do for her.

649
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:27,240
But my mom

650
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:30,160
can't wait any longer.

651
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,120
Hello?

652
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:55,360
Mom.

653
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:56,640
Bin.

654
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:58,840
Where are you?

655
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:01,680
Mom,

656
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:04,920
I'm at work, at the office.

657
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:06,800
How are you today?

658
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:08,480
Everything's fine?

659
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:10,680
Same as usual.

660
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:12,640
Don't worry about me.

661
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:15,200
I just miss you.

662
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:17,040
Why haven't you visited me

663
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,480
these past days?

664
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:29,120
Mom,

665
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:33,080
things are super busy at work.

666
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,880
But tomorrow,

667
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:37,360
I'll get the day off.

668
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:39,720
I'll come visit you tomorrow morning.

669
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:41,760
Bin,

670
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:44,520
don't overwork yourself.

671
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:48,320
Work will never be finished.

672
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:51,280
Take care of your health.

673
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:53,880
Don't worry about me.

674
00:30:54,670 --> 00:30:55,720
I'm okay.

675
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:01,240
Mom.

676
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:03,320
What is it, Bin?

677
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:05,280
I just feel

678
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:09,000
I'm very happy to be

679
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:13,200
your son in this life.

680
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:20,200
I feel the same.

681
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:24,920
Alright, Mom, I...

682
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:27,240
I gotta go now.

683
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:28,840
Work is still quite busy.

684
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:29,900
Tomorrow,

685
00:31:32,650 --> 00:31:33,610
I'll come see you.

686
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:35,150
Okay.

687
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:37,020
Get back to work.

688
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:39,630
Don't forget to come tomorrow.

689
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:42,200
I miss you.

690
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:46,080
I miss you too, Mom.

691
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:48,920
I'm hanging up now.

692
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:33,800
Don't be afraid.

693
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,880
As long as you help me,

694
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:38,920
even if I don't get the money,

695
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:41,320
I won't hurt you.

696
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:45,520
How...

697
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:46,440
How can I help you?

698
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:48,120
You'll find out soon.

699
00:33:02,140 --> 00:33:03,020
(No Signal)

700
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:09,360
Yuan Bin.

701
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:11,200
You still have a chance.

702
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:12,600
Please don't act recklessly.

703
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:14,240
When the door opens,

704
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:16,080
they'll start shooting.

705
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:18,240
Remember this,

706
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:20,080
if you stay down, you'll be fine.

707
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:21,560
No, no.

708
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:22,800
Don't do it.

709
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:23,720
Get down.

710
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:25,460
(Restricted Warehouse Area)

711
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:33,240
Time's up.

712
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:35,680
You didn't keep your promise.

713
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:38,360
I'm going to kill him!

714
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:40,520
Don't shoot!

715
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,040
Yuan Bin.

716
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:53,400
Even if you get

717
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:54,920
the 500,000 yuan,

718
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:56,200
you won't be able to spend it.

719
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:59,080
Before things go from bad to worse,

720
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:00,080
just let it go.

721
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:04,000
I'll help explain everything
to the police

722
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:06,370
and ask our colleagues

723
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:08,030
to raise money for your mom.

724
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:11,400
Everything will be alright.

725
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:13,000
It won't be alright anymore.

726
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:16,960
It's not just my mother's illness.

727
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:19,400
I'm in debt too.

728
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:20,880
There's no way

729
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:24,560
to start over
without ending it entirely.

730
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,400
What do you mean by ending it?

731
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:28,440
If I got the money,

732
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:31,360
I could pay off debts and treat my mom.

733
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:34,000
Everything would be resolved.

734
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:35,920
My mother's illness

735
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:38,720
still needs a lot of money.

736
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:43,640
Please.

737
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:47,680
Help me act this scene out, okay?

738
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:55,840
It's over, it's over.

739
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:56,760
You're safe now.

740
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:01,320
Officer.

741
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:03,000
Will he go to jail?

742
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:04,720
It's still a serious case.

743
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:06,720
But with a letter of understanding,

744
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:08,440
things might be better.

745
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:09,360
Actually,

746
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:10,400
no one was hurt.

747
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:12,600
This time,

748
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,000
I will definitely help him.

749
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:15,320
You were very brave just now.

750
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:16,480
Thank you.

751
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:19,720
Yuan Bin.

752
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,280
I didn't help you before.

753
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:23,760
This time, I won't stop until I do!

754
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:57,280
Actually,

755
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:59,160
I think Yuan Bin was just overthinking.

756
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:00,400
No one

757
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:02,360
looked down on him for being in juvie.

758
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:05,240
He probably wanted
too badly to erase that stain.

759
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:07,520
The more insecure he is,
the stronger his pride grows.

760
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:10,960
That's why communication
matters so much.

761
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:13,080
If Zhou Tianshui had talked with him

762
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:14,760
before letting him go,

763
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:16,360
and if Yuan Bin had gone

764
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:17,970
to ask Zhou Tianshui

765
00:36:17,970 --> 00:36:19,880
why he was fired,

766
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:21,080
maybe this whole misunderstanding

767
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:22,160
could've been avoided.

768
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:23,360
Yeah.

769
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:25,560
Communication's crucial.

770
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:28,040
Otherwise, misunderstandings happen

771
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:29,080
and we never know why.

772
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:30,480
Right, Captain?

773
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:32,070
Right.

774
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:33,560
But sometimes,

775
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:35,520
the one involved can't see clearly.

776
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:37,020
Right, Danyang?

777
00:36:50,180 --> 00:36:55,020
