for coming all the way here

Actually,

53
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:54,260
I came here

not just to complete

making a guest appearance.

I'm about to close a big deal.

Once I've got the money,

137
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:00,300
I'll not only pay the rent,

138
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:02,020
but also pay a whole year in advance.

Why can't you just do something decent?

144
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:11,620
Even if it's

00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:12,820

146
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:13,740

work on a construction site.

148
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:16,460
Then you can afford

149

500 yuan for the rent every month.

150
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:20,740

151
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:21,860
Pay me now.

152
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:23,380
Or I'll call the police.

153
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:24,300
You know?

154
00:11:33,710 --> 00:11:35,260
I'll leave this watch with you for now.

155
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:36,940
I'll redeem it once I have the money.

156

This watch

157
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:39,980
is worthless.

158
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:40,820
I don't want it.

159
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:42,740
I'll leave it with you as collateral.

160
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:43,700
Don't touch me.

161
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:52,260
What do you mean?

162
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:55,380
All you have is this house!

163
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:57,420
Don't look down on me!

164
00:11:57,540 --> 00:11:59,220
You just live off rent!

165
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:01,460
That's all you'll ever be.

166
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:03,180
You're not like me. I'm in business.

167
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:04,340
I've got money.

168
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:05,780
If I were you,

169
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:07,700
I'd just give up already.

170
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:09,140
Take a good look at yourself.

171
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:10,100
Watch your mouth.

172
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:11,220
Call you sugar but you're bitter,

173
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:12,340
call you salt but you've no power,

174
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:13,740
call you glue but you won't stick.

175
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:14,600
You deserve it!

176
00:12:14,610 --> 00:12:16,140
Still struggling this much at your age.

177
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:18,180
Listen here,

178
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:20,220
I'm giving you three more days.

179
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:22,200
If I don't see the money in three days,

180
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:23,180
you're out of here.

181
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:43,620
This one here.

182
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:45,820
Fang Fang definitely doesn't have this one.

183
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:47,220
Give this one to her.

184
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:48,460
This one looks nice.

185
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:50,460
Mom,

186
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:52,420
look how chubby Fang Fang used to be.

187
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:57,220
You and Fang Fang have known each other

188
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:59,540
for almost 15 years, right?

189
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:02,820
Fang Fang is going to study in another city.

190
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:05,060
It won't be easy to meet up

191
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:07,020
after she leaves.

192
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:13,740
We should adjust to life here, too.

193
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:16,300
Yun'er,

194
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:17,500
I think

195
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:20,420
you should make some new friends.

196
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:22,420
Mom,

197
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:23,740
I'm fine.

198
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:24,980
Don't worry.

199
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:30,820
It's all my fault.

200
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,300
If it weren't for your dad and me...

201
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:33,220
Mom.

202
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:37,780
It's not your fault.

Why are you bullying a girl?

227

I'm calling the police
if you're still like this.

It's Ai Lian

241
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:04,860
who told you to hide it.

242
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:06,980
It's all Ai Lian's fault, isn't it?

243
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:07,900
No.

244
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:10,100
Captain Ye, I'll forward
the suspect's video

245
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:12,140

- Okay.

246

18 years old. She just
got into college this year.

251
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:23,740
According to the witness,

252
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:25,260
Chen Yuanhang seems to know Fang Fang.

253
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:26,420
He's trying to use Fang Fang

254
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:27,580
to find someone else.

255
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:29,620
The car he's driving isn't registered to him.

256
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:31,060

The owner is Wang Shengli.

257

The suspect's vehicle

259
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:35,210
was just spotted at
the Wufang Road intersection.

260
00:16:35,210 --> 00:16:36,750
Head straight
at the next intersection.

261
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:41,220
Xin, why aren't you following the GPS?

262
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:42,900
I have Binjiang's map in my head.

263
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:44,340
Trust me, this way is faster.

264
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:56,100
I see Fang Fang.

265
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:57,180
She's in the passenger seat.

266

Be quiet! Think about it.

273

274
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:26,460

She said Chen Yuanhang has been violent.

301

For over a year,
they've been hiding from him.

302

303

her mother works at Shengxin Creative Park,

304
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:07,740

divorced four years ago.

311
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:33,130
(Chen Yuanhang, Ai Lian)
He was detained for domestic violence.

312
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:33,980
Out of revenge,

313
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:35,660
(Brief of injuries)
he threw sulfuric acid at his ex-wife

314
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:36,580
and was sentenced to prison.

315
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:38,220
He just got out last year.

316
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:41,140
Chen Yuanhang is not from Binjiang.

317
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:43,540
After being released, he came
to Binjiang from his hometown.

318

According to Wang Shengli,

his landlord,

320
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:48,700

322

324
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:54,700
and even mortgaged his family's house.

325
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:56,940
Now he can't even pay a 500-yuan rent.

326
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:58,100

332
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:07,260

375
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:49,820
(Beauty Salon)
Chen Yuanhang did not come to the beauty salon.

376
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:51,980
Ai Lian just left, whereabouts unknown.

377
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:53,500
Check the 7th floor.

378
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:54,540
Let's go down.

379
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:00,820
Captain.

380
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:02,140
Chen Yun'er has arrived.

381
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:03,060
Ask her.

382
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:03,980
Turn on the speaker.

383
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:06,380
Don't worry.

384
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:07,660
Your mother will be fine.

385
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:09,810
How long has it been
since you saw your father?

386
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:13,140
I don't want to see him.

387
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:15,640
He doesn't deserve to be my father.

388
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:17,180
Based on what you know about him,

389
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:18,900
what do you think he wants to do?

390
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:21,500
Whenever he's in a bad mood,

391
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:23,740
he'll cause trouble for me and my mom.

392
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:25,020
Sometimes when he's drunk,

393
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:26,500
he's like a different person.

394
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:28,500
He can do anything when he's like that.

395
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:29,700
Are you scared of him?

396
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:31,220
Yes.

397
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:34,300
He takes every penny

398
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:35,740
my mom worked hard for.

399
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:37,460
Then he acts neurotic every day.

400
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:40,540
Whenever he sees my mom
talking to another man,

401
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:42,180
he says my mom is cheating.

402
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:43,440
You're keeping another man.

403
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:45,500
You're keeping another man.

404
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:46,580
- Aren't you?
- No.

405
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:48,100
Lustful!

406
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:50,260
Go find your daughter. Go.

407
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:51,580
Yun'er is in a very bad state now.

408
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:53,340
Can you let her calm down for a while?

409
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:55,460
I have to give you some punishment.

410
00:23:55,660 --> 00:23:56,620
Look at this.

411
00:23:56,860 --> 00:23:58,020
You recognize these two words?

412
00:23:58,580 --> 00:24:00,460
Don't push me. I might lose control.

413
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:01,980
I have nothing left to lose.

414
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:03,020
Tell me where my daughter is.

415
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:04,380
- Don't do this. Listen.
- Tell me where she is.

416
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:05,660
- I'll call the police.
- What are you doing?

417
00:24:05,660 --> 00:24:06,520
If you dare,

418
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:08,100
- I'll throw this at you.
- Get out!

419
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:09,100
Go make the call.

420
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:10,020
Don't do this.

421
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:11,900
Don't force me.

422
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:12,820
Mom!

423
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:15,860
My mom stayed with him

424
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:18,460
for my sake.

425
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:21,700
She wanted to give me a complete family.

426
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:24,300
It's all because of Chen Yuanhang.

427
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:26,020
This family

428
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:27,980
might as well fall apart.

429
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:31,020
Mom,

430
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:32,580
after all these years,

431
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:35,740
you've done enough for me.

432
00:24:37,290 --> 00:24:38,920
It's time you should think about yourself.

433
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:40,940
But you're about to go to college.

434
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:42,750
Aren't you afraid of your classmates...

435
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:44,140
Mom.

436
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:46,940
Do you want me to die
before you'll divorce him?

437
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:52,020
Fine.

438
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:55,780
My mom lives in pain every day.

439
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:57,780
Only God knows

440
00:24:58,620 --> 00:24:59,700
what we've been through.

441
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:06,500
Where's my daughter?

442
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:09,500
Where's my daughter?

443
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:11,580
What are you doing?

444
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:14,220
Help! Help!

445
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:18,980

(Surveillance, LARP Corridor)

447
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:22,100
Captain, Chen Yuanhang has taken Ai Lian

448
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:24,340
and entered a studio
under renovation on the 7th floor.

449
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:26,180
Since the office is still under renovation,

450
00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:27,380
there are no cameras inside.

451
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:28,500
Understood.

452
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:29,940
- Don't come over.
- Put the knife down first.

453
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:30,820
Don't come over.

454
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:32,500
If you come over, I'll kill her. Get out.

455
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:34,380
Get lost.

456
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:36,340
I've been waiting for Yun'er to contact me.

457
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:37,340
But I just can't reach her.

458
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:39,100
Is it you who won't let her contact me?

459
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,100
It's been years

460
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:44,660
since I last saw my precious daughter.

461
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:47,100
You just won't let us meet, right?

462
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:48,340
Tell me where my daughter is.

463
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:49,700
Tell me. Where?

464
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:51,340
I don't know.

465
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:54,140
You're the most vicious woman.

466
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:55,540
The most vicious woman!

467
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:06,500
You sent me to prison.

468
00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:09,180
You've ruined my life.

00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:11,300

try another way?

No one can help me.

484
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:40,100
I'm not lying to you, officer.

485
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:42,340
Step back.

If you're a man, don't bully a woman.

- Stop right there.
- Shut up.

Stop. Stop.

Stop! Who are you calling pitiful?

Take the stairs.

00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:20,140
If he wanted to kill her, he'd have done it.

525
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:21,060
He has other motives.

You would understand, right?

533
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:41,380
Where is he taking my mom?

534
00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:43,420
I decide wherever he wants to go.

535
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:46,420
We have full security control,

Don't you know?

546
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:32,020
I've also thought about

547
00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:34,300
living happily with you

548
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:35,980
and our daughter.

00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:40,220
But when my career was starting to take off,

550
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:45,340
you brought up divorce.

551
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:48,620
You're still not clear about this?

552
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:51,340
Those people were all lying to you.

553
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:55,780
What business requires a house as collateral?

554
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:57,900
Our daughter is still young.

555
00:29:58,500 --> 00:29:59,860
I have to consider her.

556
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:02,060
Am I not thinking about her?

00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:04,300
Mom.

558
00:30:05,810 --> 00:30:07,860
(Surveillance, Elevator)
Once I make a lot of money,

559
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:10,220
I just want my precious daughter

560
00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:12,500
to live a life like a princess.

561
00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:14,780
You know this is what I want.

562
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:17,380
Can you wake up?

563
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:21,460
You don't even know what your daughter wants.

564
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:26,500
How can you still say that?

565
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:28,840
(Surveillance, Elevator)
She's closest to me.

566
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:31,020
It's because you're sowing discord

567
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:33,260
to drive us apart.

568
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:35,900
That's why we haven't
seen each other for so long.

569
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:40,020
It's been two years.

570
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:42,540
We haven't seen each other at all.

571
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:46,660
Even if I could just hear her voice,

572
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:49,100
I'd be satisfied.

573
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:54,820
Do you know how much I miss her?

574
00:30:55,580 --> 00:30:56,500
Captain.

575
00:30:56,820 --> 00:30:59,220
The crowd in the garage has been evacuated.

576
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:01,660
Reinforcements have been deployed.

577
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:03,780
The elevator can be stopped
at the garage at any time.

578
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:08,260
You evil woman.

579
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:09,620
(Surveillance, Elevator)

580
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:12,940
Mom.

581
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:33,900
Come with me.

582
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:34,820
Let go of me.

583
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:36,100
I want to go to the scene.

584
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:37,340
You can't go.

585
00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:38,500
We have our plans.

586
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:40,220
You have your plans.

587
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:41,980
But I have my reasons.

588
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:43,500
Let me talk to him.

589
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:45,180
I think now,

590
00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:46,860
he might be more willing to listen to me.

591
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:48,220
Chen Yun'er, right?

592
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:51,100
I'm Zhou Ming, Deputy Director
of Binjiang Public Security Bureau.

593
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:53,160
(Binjiang Public Security Bureau)
We will do everything we can

594
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:54,460
(Command Center)
to rescue your mother.

595
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:56,300
Director Zhou, I need to go to the scene.

596
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:58,780
(Commander)
No, the situation is too unpredictable.

597
00:31:58,820 --> 00:32:00,100
You're still a child.

598
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:01,420
I'm already 18.

599
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:02,980
What I've been through

600
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:05,300
is more than you can imagine.

601
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:06,900
Please trust us.

602
00:32:20,540 --> 00:32:22,660
So you colluded to kill me, right?

603
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:24,020
Is that it?

604
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:25,460
You colluded to kill me.

605
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:27,180
I didn't... I didn't...

606
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:28,940
Don't come closer. Don't move.

607
00:32:30,020 --> 00:32:31,420
If you come over, I'll kill her.

608
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:32,340
Don't get excited.

609
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:33,620
Chen Yuanhang.

610
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:35,060
We're here to help you.

611
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:42,060
(Policewoman's Mini-Class)

612
00:32:42,340 --> 00:32:46,260
Life is difficult for most people.

613
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:48,140
The world is unpredictable.

614
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:49,940
Whether in poverty or wealth,

615
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:52,140
no life is smooth sailing.

616
00:32:52,780 --> 00:32:55,300
How to face difficulties and overcome them

617
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:58,060
is a lesson we must learn in our lifetime.

618
00:32:58,420 --> 00:33:00,420
Move forward bravely.

619
00:33:00,540 --> 00:33:01,780
Don't blame anyone or anything.

620
00:33:02,140 --> 00:33:03,540
Embrace the beauty of tomorrow

621
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:05,820
