We're here to help you.

You want to help me?

34
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,200
You should know that this world

35
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,000
has been very unfair to me.

36
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,480
All I want now is to see my daughter.

Is this really fair to your daughter?

38
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:06,600
Think about her.

39
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,680
If she finds out you hurt her mother,

40
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:10,800
how heartbroken will she be?

41
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,880
For your daughter's sake,

42
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,680
let Ai Lian go.

43
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,440
You were once a family.

00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:36,080
It's not that I won't let you see Yun'er.

48
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:40,000
It's that she's afraid.

49
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,520
She doesn't dare to see you.

50
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,200
That's impossible.

51
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,800
That's impossible.

52
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:48,480
You have to know,

53
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,840
Yun'er and I were very close.

54
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,920
It's you who came between us,

55
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,600
and turned us against each other.

56
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,400
Let me be there, please.

57
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,200
Let me go.

00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,960
Trust us, okay?

59
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:01,960
We'll keep your mother safe.

60
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:02,800
Alright?

63
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:07,240
I think it's worth a try.

64
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,600
Chen Yuanhang has lost everything.

65
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,800
His heart is filled with rage.

66
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,940
(Command Center)
Chen Yun'er is his weakness.

67
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,720
If we can make him believe

68
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:17,320
there's still a chance to rebuild that bond,

69
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,680
he might change.

70
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
All Chen Yuanhang wants
is to see his daughter.

71
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,000
If he really sees her,

72
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,600
it will definitely help calm him down.

73
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,480
And Yun'er just said

74
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,400
her dad has never been mean to her.

75
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:30,480
That's right.

76
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,080
My dad has never been mean to me.

77
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,680
Let me go to the scene.

78
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,000
Lin Wanru, Tang Xin.

79
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,600
You must keep her safe.

80
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:39,960
Yes, sir.

81
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:41,760
When you see your dad later,

82
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,840
try to help him calm down.

83
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,480
Talk to him about your childhood stories

84
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,360
and about your life now.

85
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:49,760
Yun'er,

86
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,440
this is our only chance.

87
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,160
You have to remind him of something positive.

88
00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:55,110
Do you understand?

89
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:57,720
Even if I can't see my daughter,
I can still kill you.

90
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,280
- Do you believe me?
- Dad!

91
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:01,920
Dad.

92
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,520
It's me, Yun'er. Dad.

I'm here.

96
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,880
I'm standing right here, Dad.

97
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:12,890
Don't panic.

98
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,390
Keep calming him down.

99
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,190
Dad.

100
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:19,800
I'm begging you.

101
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:20,880
Please let Mom go.

102
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:22,760
Don't you miss me?

103
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:23,960
I missed you too.

104
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,560
Dad, can we talk?

105
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,120
Why is Yun'er with the police?

106
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,560
You sent me to prison back then.

107
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,480
Now you want to harm Yun'er too?

108
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,200
You wicked woman.

109
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:34,720

110

Yun'er, don't be afraid.

111
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,200
Come to me.

112
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,600
Yun'er, don't come over!

113
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:41,320
- Don't!
- What are you doing?

114
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,920
- Dad, don't touch her!
- What are you doing?

- What are you doing?

to choose their parents, right?

00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:17,200
and things finally calmed down for a while.

192
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,520
Now it's flaring up again.

193
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:19,640
Isn't this a resurgence?

194
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:20,960
Food first.

195
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,880
We'll have a meeting after the meal.

196
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:24,480
Alright.

197
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,120
Want chili?

198
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,080
Yes, please.

199
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:36,000
Thanks, Qiaoqiao. Give me.

200
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:37,520
Is my beef ready?

201
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:39,280
What's the rush?

202
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:41,160
(Braised Dishes)
It's ready, it's ready.

203
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:42,120
This one's yours.

204
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,160
Okay, thanks.

205
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:47,440
Don't go! Her beef isn't fresh.

206
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,720
- It's sour.
- Smell it.

207
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,160
- It's spoiled.
- I buy from her all the time.

208
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,440
This is freshly bought beef!

209
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,440
Fresh beef?

210
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:53,920
How long did you have it
before selling it to us?

211
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:55,400
Don't buy it, everyone! Get a refund!

212
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:57,000
- What are you doing? Refund!
- Refund!

213
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,360
Hurry up and refund us!

214
00:12:58,840 --> 00:12:59,720
I don't want it.

215
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,520
Give the refund! Hurry up!

216
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:05,460
What are you staring at?

217
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:13,720
Qiaoqiao, are you hungry?

218
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:15,800
Qiaoqiao?

219
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:17,520
Qiaoqiao?

220
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:20,440
Sir, have you seen Qiaoqiao?

221
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:21,680
No.

222
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:22,910
Qiaoqiao!

223
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:24,210
Qiaoqiao!

224
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:25,160
Qiaoqiao!

225
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:27,800
Have you seen Qiaoqiao?

226
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,680
Have you seen a little girl?

227
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:30,680
Officer.

228
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,200
Officer, my child is missing.

229
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,280
I can't find my child.

230
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:35,520
I can't find my child.

231
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:36,560
Take it easy.

232
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,200
Calm down and tell us what happened.

233
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,360
She's about three years old.

234
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,520
About this tall.

235
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:41,600
Wearing pink clothes

236
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,520
with a ponytail.

237
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:43,800
But I can't find her.

238
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,560
I've searched several streets already.

239
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:46,400
We got it.

240
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:47,920
We'll help you find her, don't worry.

241
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:49,210
Captain Ye.

242
00:13:49,210 --> 00:13:50,780
The child isn't crying or fussing.

243
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:52,110
Suspect likely be an acquaintance.

244
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:55,560
I've already sent the suspect's video.

245
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:58,120
Take a look.

246
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,840
Do you recognize this person?

247
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:01,960
Yes, I do.

248
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:05,640
He's the eldest brother in our family.

249
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,720
He doesn't have children.

250
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:11,480
He just likes playing with Qiaoqiao.

251
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:14,480
This has happened before.

252
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,520
I overreacted.

253
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,680
Sorry to trouble you.

254
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,680
I'll go find him now.

255
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:23,300
(Integrated Police Communication System)

256
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:25,080
(Police Dispatch)
They were seen near Siru Alley.

257
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,440
Okay, got it.

258
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:40,520
Let's split up.

259
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,120
I want my mom.

260
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,280
I want my mom!

261
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:05,080
- Stop right there!
- Mom!

262
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,920
- Stop!
- Stop!

263
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:11,000
- Stop!
- Don't run!

264
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:14,440
Why were you running?

265
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,160
Who is this child to you?

266
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,040
She's my niece.

267
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:19,240
I'm her uncle.

268
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:20,960
Her parents are divorced.

269
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:22,480
Custody went to her mom.

270
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,560
Her grandma kept saying
she wanted to see her.

271
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:26,880
She missed her.

272
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,400
I had no other choice.

273
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:29,480
No matter the reason,

274
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,040
if you take a child

275
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,120
without guardian consent,

276
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:33,280
that's illegal.

277
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:34,840
Yes.

278
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,240
I know I was wrong.

279
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
What did you just put in her pocket?

280
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,280
I... I didn't put anything.

281
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:43,480
Take it out.

282
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:45,920
Take it out!

283
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:03,760
Name?

284
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:07,800
Liu Dachuan.

285
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:09,960
You were the one who put drugs

286
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:12,120
in Qiaoqiao's pocket?

287
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:14,400
We've checked.

288
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:15,760
You used drugs before.

289
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,760
Li Jingjing tried to cover for you.

290
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:21,360
But she didn't know that's against the law.

291
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:24,120
Even after divorcing your brother,

292
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:27,240
she still saw you as the child's uncle.

293
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:29,920
She still cared about you deeply

294
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:32,040
and kept pleading with us for you.

295
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:34,600
Even your niece,

296
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:36,240
she asked,

297
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:38,000
"What happened to my uncle?"

298
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:51,400
I've let Qiaoqiao down.

299
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:55,640
I'm such a jerk.

300
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:58,000
He...

301
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,920
He told me to bring Qiaoqiao to him.

302
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:04,080
I didn't have money to buy drugs.

303
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:06,400
Money.

304
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,800
I really don't have any.

305
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:10,240
I heard your brother divorced
your sister-in-law.

306
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:12,560
Your sister-in-law's
raising the child alone,

307
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:13,480
right?

308
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:20,000
How old is the child?

309
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:21,920
Three.

310
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:24,440
Bring that child to me.

311
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:26,000
Then,

312
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:28,720
I promise you'll have all the drugs you want.

313
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:35,360
No. No.

314
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,280
What a loser.

315
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,290
What are you going to do to my niece?

316
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:46,040
What could I possibly do to her?

317
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:48,680
Of course she'd live a good life with me.

318
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:51,200
Way better than staying
with your sister-in-law.

319
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,680
Is my beef ready? Give it to me.

320
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:58,780
This one's yours.

321
00:17:58,780 --> 00:17:59,780
(Braised Dishes)

322
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:03,160
Don't go!

323
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,400
Her beef isn't fresh!

324
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:06,840
Your beef isn't fresh!

325
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:08,520
Everyone smell it, come on!

326
00:18:12,490 --> 00:18:14,200
- Your beef isn't fresh.
- Let me smell it.

327
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:15,440
This is freshly bought beef!

328
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,400
Fresh beef?

329
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,280
Everyone, don't buy it!

330
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:19,520
- I want a refund!
- The sauce is clean!

331
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:20,360
I don't want mine either.

332
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:21,400
- I'll get you a new one.
- Refund!

333
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,440
He doesn't just deal drugs,

334
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:26,240
but also involved in trafficking.

335
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,640
He was going to sell Qiaoqiao.

336
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:34,190
I...

337
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,320
I went against my conscience

338
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:38,680
and played dumb.

339
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:40,600
You must have arranged

340
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:43,840
how and where to exchange the child, right?

341
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:48,440
3 PM.

342
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:50,760
In Hejia Alley.

343
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,040
What's his name?

344
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:54,240
Lu Zhiheng.

345
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:12,640
I'm here.

346
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:13,800
That's him.

347
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:24,800
Stop!

348
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,080
- Stop!
- Stop!

349
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:28,920
Don't run!

350
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,000
Stop! Don't run!

351
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:45,520
Wait.

352
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:47,400
Who are you guys?

353
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:49,160
Name?

354
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:50,840
Wait.

355
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:52,640
Who are you guys?

356
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,040
Lu Zhiheng.

357
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:04,480
Wait, are you the police?

358
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:05,680
Don't move.

359
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:06,840
Officer, it's a misunderstanding!

360
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:08,880
I thought you were robbers, really!

361
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:10,400
It's just a misunderstanding!

362
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,320
Let's talk this out calmly,okay?

363
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,250
- It's a misunderstanding! I'm a good guy!
- Move!

364
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:20,080
If you hadn't chased me, would I have run?

365
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:21,800
(Great Responsibility)
Director Zhou,

366
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,960
Lu Zhiheng has confessed
the drug stash location.

367
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:25,840
And there's more.

368
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,000
At that place,

369
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:28,750
there are three girls locked up.

370
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:31,760
Yes.

371
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:35,760
Anyone there?

372
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:42,800
So noisy.

373
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:45,520
Let's continue.

374
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:55,400
Everyone can only have a small sip.

375
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:58,000
An'an, you go first.

376
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:21,960
Don't move!

377
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:41,620
(Police)

378
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:54,600
Captain, we're ready.

379
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:09,060
(Command Center)

380
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:13,660
(Integrated Police Communication System)

381
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:23,420
(Raptor Commandos)

382
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:48,320
Sister.

383
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:49,240
What's wrong?

384
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:50,630
Shh.

385
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,240
Wanru.

386
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:07,280
Don't be afraid.

387
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,160
We're the police. We're here to help.

388
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:11,680
They're the police!

389
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:15,840
You must protect yourself.

390
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,600
Don't let them catch you.

391
00:24:18,830 --> 00:24:19,880
Don't go with them.

392
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:20,720
They're bad people.

393
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:22,400
Come on, sit down.

394
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,840
I will protect you.

395
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:25,600
Don't be afraid.

396
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:27,120
We'll be in soon.

397
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:29,360
Sis,I want to go home.

398
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:32,400
Go home...

399
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:37,000
You can't go with them.

400
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,360
I can't lose you.

401
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:41,200
I need you.

402
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,840
Don't let the police catch you.

403
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:43,680
Don't open the door.

404
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:44,960
They'll make you see

405
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,080
that only staying here

406
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:49,400
is the safest and best choice.

407
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:51,040
I know.

408
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,560
You can't go. Come back!

409
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:56,840
Why? I want to leave!

410
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:58,480
Sis,I want to go home!

411
00:24:58,480 --> 00:24:59,760
I want to leave!

412
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01,320
What's wrong with you,sister?

413
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:09,880
Don't come closer!

414
00:25:12,630 --> 00:25:13,500
Stop crying!

415
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:14,360
Calm down first.

416
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:15,880
We can talk it out.

417
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:17,480
Get out! All of you, get out!

418
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,520
Sister.

419
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:24,080
Why are you doing this to me?

420
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:25,680
I don't want to die.

421
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:27,920
An'an, don't be scared.

422
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:28,960
I won't hurt you.

423
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:31,560
Then please let me go.

424
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:32,720
Don't soften.

425
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:34,310
You're doing the right thing.

426
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:36,600
None of us can fall into the hands
of the police.

427
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,880
You're protecting them.

428
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:39,720
No.

429
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:41,660
We must wait for him to come back.

430
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:43,520
Once he comes back, we'll be safe.

431
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:45,880
No! I don't want to wait for him.

432
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:47,200
Stop crying, you guys!

433
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,560
You're safe now.

434
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:50,880
- Come here.
- Miss.

435
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,600
Put down the scissors first.

436
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:54,120
You're scaring the kids.

437
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:55,600
Where do you want to go?

438
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:57,480
You can tell us.

439
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:58,760
We'll take you there, okay?

440
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:00,260
(Joint Operations Command Center)
Impossible.

441
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:02,160
There's no way you know where he is.

442
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:04,160
We have to wait for him right here.

443
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:09,880
Look,

444
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:11,800
you don't even have food here.

445
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:13,960
Aren't you all hungry?

446
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:16,040
- I'm hungry.
- I'm hungry too.

447
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:18,400
Then I'll get you something to eat.

448
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:19,280
Is that okay?

449
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:23,400
Is it?

450
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:34,520
Here, food's here!

451
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:35,440
Food's here!

452
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:39,640
Have some snacks to fill your stomach first.

453
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:42,040
I'll bring it over to you.

454
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:50,080
Put it on the floor.

455
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:54,280
Okay.

456
00:26:57,380 --> 00:26:58,580
(Police Hotline 110)
Director Zhou,

457
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:00,560
photo comparison
with the database is complete.

458
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:01,520
I've sent to Hummer.

459
00:27:01,990 --> 00:27:02,760
Captain,

460
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:04,120
(Yu Weiwei)
the oldest girl here

461
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:05,200
(Mo Jia'an)
is named Yu Weiwei.

462
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:07,120
She went missing in Tianbei three years ago.

463
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:08,000
She was 15 then.

464
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:09,160
Suspected abduction.

465
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:10,450
Her features match.

466
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:12,920
The other two were confirmed missing

467
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:14,080
four months ago.

468
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:15,320
The older one is Mo Jia'an.

469
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:16,560
The younger one is Sun Xiaolei.

470
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,680
(Yu Weiwei)
I've read Yu Weiwei's file.

471
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:21,120
Her parents divorced when she was four.

472
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:23,120
She was raised by her grandma.

473
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:25,200
Her grandma passed when she was 14.

474
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:27,560
She dropped out six months later,
no reason given.

475
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:28,840
Such a pity.

476
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:30,640
She had excellent grades

477
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:32,080
and strong literary talent.

478
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:34,160
Back in school,

479
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:35,440
she entered poetry contests

480
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:36,640
and won first prize.

481
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:39,840
Yu Weiwei is clearly a victim.

482
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:41,240
She should be waiting for rescue.

483
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:43,760
Why does she treat the police as enemies?

484
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:45,360
Stockholm Syndrome.

485
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:46,680
Prolonged interaction

486
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:48,040
plus intentional conditioning

487
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:50,480
can make a hostage
develop psychological dependence

488
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:51,920
on their captor.

489
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:53,640
It makes sense.

490
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:55,840
Especially when the hostage is very young.

491
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:57,720
If they don't receive

492
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:59,320
enough love from their parents,

493
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:01,280
they're more easily trapped in this.

494
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:02,920
A little sweetness

495
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,560
can make all the pain feel forgivable.

496
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:07,560
Maybe

497
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:11,000
she was deliberately
trained to hate the police.

498
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:14,520
Sister.

499
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:17,120
The people giving us food are good guys.

500
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:18,760
Let's go with them.

501
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:21,480
You're scaring me when you're like this.

502
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:23,720
Don't be afraid.

503
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:25,360
She won't hurt you.

504
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:27,160
Do you know me?

505
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:28,800
Of course I know you.

506
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:30,440
I know them too.

507
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:32,680
Your name is Mo Jia'an, right?

508
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:34,640
Don't talk to the police.

509
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:37,400
You're Yu Weiwei.

510
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:39,880
Weiwei.

511
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:42,040
You have a beautiful name.

512
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:44,720
There's an anime called One Piece.

513
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:45,720
Have you seen it?

514
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:48,320
There's a princess in it named Vivi.

515
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:50,640
Princess Vivi is very kind.

516
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:52,800
What she hates most

517
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:54,040
is seeing people get hurt.

518
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,280
But she herself

519
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:58,720
is often the one hurt the most.

520
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:03,120
But I'm not a princess.

521
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:05,960
Same name,

522
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:08,720
different fate.

523
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:12,320
But you got one thing right.

524
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:15,640
I'm the one who's been hurt the most.

525
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:17,280
Who hurt you?

526
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:21,200
Who hasn't?

527
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:24,520
Even my parents didn't want me.

528
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,440
Who can I even talk to?

529
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,400
No one ever cared about me.

530
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:33,720
That's not true.

531
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:36,160
The two of them care about you.

532
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:37,720
They rely on you too.

533
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:39,440
I can see it.

534
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:45,520
Weiwei.

535
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:47,840
Who do you care about?

536
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:51,000
Are you waiting for someone?

537
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:56,800
No one's coming.

538
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:01,800
That's not true.

539
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:03,480
He'll come back.

540
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:05,760
He will.

541
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:08,280
Girl.

542
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:10,240
Let me be honest with you.

543
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:11,440
I know who's the person

544
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:13,240
you're waiting for.

545
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:14,880
But,

546
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:17,520
he's in some trouble right now.

547
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:19,640
We want to help him.

548
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:21,720
If you're willing, come with us.

549
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:22,560
Alright?

550
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:24,910
You won't be able to wait for him.

551
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
Sister.

552
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,680
Why would you rather trust a bad guy

553
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:31,520
than trust the police?

554
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:33,520
He hit you all the time, didn't he?

555
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:43,520
Weiwei.

556
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:45,760
Weiwei.

557
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:49,320
Good girl, Weiwei.

558
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:50,600
Look.

559
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,440
I bought you a gift.

560
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:53,960
Do you like it?

561
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:58,480
As long as you behave,

562
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:01,480
you'll get more and more presents.

563
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:10,480
How dare you run!

564
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:12,840
How dare you disobey me! Try running!

565
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:19,560
Next time you disobey,

566
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:20,840
this will be your consequence.

567
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:31,280
No.

568
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:33,800
He treats me well.

569
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:35,520
Even if he hits me,

570
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:37,280
it's only when I make mistakes.

571
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:39,160
It's just discipline.

572
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:40,600
He had to set rules.

573
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,240
Don't believe them.

574
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:44,640
They're not good people.

575
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:45,800
If you go with them,

576
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:47,280
you'll be locked in a dark room.

577
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:49,800
In jail, there's no one to talk to.

578
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:51,880
Do you know what darkness feels like?

579
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,160
Do you know what it feels like

580
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:54,600
when no one talks to you

581
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:55,680
for a whole month in jail?

582
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:57,280
That feels like hell.

583
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:58,800
Weiwei.

584
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:03,520
Do you think he's good to you?

585
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:06,920
As long as you stay in the place
he tells you to,

586
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:09,000
he can protect you?

587
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:10,440
Is that it?

588
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:14,760
Since you understand what I'm saying,

589
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,240
then

590
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:18,520
please

591
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:20,640
don't disturb us.

592
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:23,560
Us?

593
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:27,880
You mean he's here?

594
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:36,760
He's everywhere.

595
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,640
Only I understand you.

596
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:41,440
Only I understand you.

597
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:42,640
Only I understand you.

598
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:43,840
Only I understand you.

599
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:45,200
Only I understand you.

600
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:46,800
Only I understand you.

601
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:48,480
Only I understand you.

602
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:59,620
(Policewoman's Mini-Class)

603
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:00,800
If a child goes missing,

604
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:02,810
(Policewoman's Mini-Class)
don't wait for 24 hours.

605
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:04,800
Call 110 immediately to report it.

606
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:06,320
When reporting, provide

607
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:08,560
time of disappearance,

608
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:10,280
location, clothing,

609

gender, height, physical features,

610
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:14,960
and contact info of the guardian.

611
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:18,040

612

based on the child disappearance
response mechanism.

613
00:33:20,910 --> 00:33:22,360
To keep your child from getting lost,

614
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:23,920
teach them to memorize

615
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:26,240
phone numbers and addresses,

616
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:28,640
or place a note with this information

617
