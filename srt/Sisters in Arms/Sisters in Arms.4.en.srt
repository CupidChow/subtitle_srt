00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:47,840
In our line of work,

25
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,840
I'm not a pro but I've been around the block.

26
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:52,960
I've never seen anyone

27
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:53,920
quit drugs on their own.

28
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,400
Quit drugs?

29
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,080
Are you crazy?

30
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,400
Let me tell you.

31
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:11,280
Once you step into this river,

32
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,600
there's no going back!

33
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,960
Why do you care?

34
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,800
I might as well just die.

35
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:23,880
You can't die.

36
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,400
If you die,

37
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,280
how will I ask for the money you owe me?

38
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:40,140
Help me deliver some goods.

39
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:51,040
No.

40
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:53,680
This is drug trafficking.

41
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,760
If I get caught,

42
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,080
my life is over.

43
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:59,000
What's going on in your head?

44
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,200
Is it filled with crap?

45
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,360
Come on, take a look.

46
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:06,400
Come on.

47
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:07,810
Take a look at where you live.

48
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,720
Take a good look!

49
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,640
You owe us money,

50
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:15,520
yet you live like a dog.

51
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,320
Stop pretending with me!

52
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:19,320
Drop the act!

53
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:23,480
If I were in your shoes,

54
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,560
I'd pull no punches and do whatever it takes.

55
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,840
You'd enjoy a good life with me.

56
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:29,880
It'll be amazing.

57
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,440
That's life, bro.

58
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:39,600
Fine.

59
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,880
You don't want to do it? Fine.

60
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,610
But I can't leave empty-handed today.

61
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,080
You owe us...

62
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:48,400
You're such a mess.

63
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,720
You can't even pay back the money.

64
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,080
I'll go find your parents now.

65
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,440
Please, don't.

66
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:56,360
I'll do it.

67
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:57,520
I'll do it.

68
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:58,680
I'll do it.

69
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:08,340
Have you thought it through?

70
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:20,560
Don't worry.

71
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,080
I won't treat you badly.

72
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,360
Every time you help me deliver goods,

73
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,760
I'll give you a ration

74
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:26,840
as a reward.

75
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,160
Do it well.

76
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:34,880
When you make money,

77
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,040
won't our debt be settled?

78
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:39,800
In the future, we'll make money together

79
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:42,040
and enjoy happiness together.

80
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,240
Isn't that good?

81
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,840
What do you young people call this?

82
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,120
Life, right?

83
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:54,120
Did I just give you a

84
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:56,560
unique life, bro?

85
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:02,800
But you have to remember.

86
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,040
Don't try any tricks

87
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:07,080
and don't take any of the goods.

88
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:10,160
You can guess the consequences, huh?

89
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:21,760
I'll send you the address later.

90
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:43,600
What's the rush?

91
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,480
The food is ready.
Stay and eat before you go.

92
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,360
We can't afford your food.

93
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,760
Let's go, everyone.

94
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,520
Don't ever come back here again,

95
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,800
so they don't look down on us.

96
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:54,920
How heartless.

97
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,200
Exactly. Let's go, let's go.

98
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,120
She always

99
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,480
talks about how capable she is,

100
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:01,480
but can't even handle this little thing.

101
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,480
Talking big is easy,
but doing things is hard.

102
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:05,360
She didn't talk big.

103
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,600
She's the elite of the elites.

104
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,160
She just looks down on us common folks.

105
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,720
She has her difficulties.

106
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,840
Don't get mad. Think of another way.

107
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:29,240
Dad.

108
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,160
I'm sorry.

109
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,320
Tang Xin.

110
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,680
Your mom and I

111
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,240
have done so much for you.

112
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,880
Is this how you repay us?

113
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:49,200
Gorgeous.

114
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:50,720
Very elegant

115
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,800
and classy.

116
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:53,360
Back then,

117
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:56,720
I won your father over with this dress.

118
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:59,520
And this necklace you're wearing

119
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,800
is our family's treasure.

120
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,160
Let me tell you,

121
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,680
you need to behave today,

122
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,920
and keep your voice gentle.

123
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,320
Be more ladylike.

124
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:10,560
Do you hear me?

125
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,680
Listen,

126
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:14,800
Eric comes from a good family

127
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:15,680
and is very handsome.

128
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,960
You must seize this opportunity.

129
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:19,080
Talk to him more.

130
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,320
- Okay.
- Go ahead.

131
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,400
Talk to him. Come back later.

132
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:03,720
Are you still playing?

133
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,520
If you're not playing, let me play for a bit.

134
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,000
Let me play for a bit.

135
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:14,040
I'm playing.

136
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,800
You haven't played.

137
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:11,640
Xin.

138
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:13,520
Call me in half an hour.

139
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:14,800
Don't forget.

140
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:16,620
(City Roaming Arcade)

141
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,200
Hello.

142
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:43,920
Is this the Anti-Drug Squad?

143
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,360
Hello, Miss Liu.

144
00:09:58,720 --> 00:09:59,640
My name is Eric.

145
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,960
Feel free to order. Don't be shy.

146
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,200
(Why is it so expensive?)

147
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,560
I don't really eat Western food.

148
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,200
How about you order instead?

149
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,120
I understand.

150
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,760
Restaurants of this level

151
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:24,720
are not affordable for just anyone.

152
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,480
So it's okay if you can't order.

153
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:27,480
No need to feel inferior.

154
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,040
Waiter.

155
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,800
Mingzhe.

156
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,640
You did great, bro!

157
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:04,960
Awesome!

158
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:07,680
You were just a little nervous.

159
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,720
But it's okay, it's your first time.

160
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:10,640
Don't worry.

161
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,280
Same time tomorrow.

162
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:20,920
Same place.

163
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:29,760
Wait a second.

164
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:39,040
Congratulations on your debut today.

165
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,320
This is for you.

166
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,240
From now on, we're brothers.

167
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:48,880
Go ahead.

168
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,280
Good luck.

169
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,120
Beautiful.

170
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:16,960
Really beautiful.

171
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:19,720
What's beautiful?

172
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:22,920
Your necklace.

173
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:26,640
Come on, have a drink.

174
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:28,180
We have a rule against drinking alcohol.

175
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:56,960
Fine wine

176
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,400
and a beautiful woman.

177
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,520
Let me introduce myself.

178
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,200
I am someone

179
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,120
with some aspirations.

180
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,800
They say learning never ends.

181
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,480
And I hope to continue my studies.

182
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,480
My family has many properties.

183
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:17,000
My mom says I should just focus on studying,

184
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,560
and not worry about worldly things.

185
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:19,600
Just prepare well

186
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,680
for the graduate exam.

187
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,200
Don't you agree?

188
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,520
I think

189
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,160
money doesn't represent

190
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,280
a person's character.

191
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,280
That's why I'm here to meet you.

192
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:37,200
I don't care how much my partner earns

193
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:39,200
or their education.

194
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:41,720
What matters to me is

195
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:45,800
their character.

196
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:47,600
As a girl,

197
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,600
good character

198
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:50,560
comes first, of course.

199
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:53,400
I hope my partner is like

200
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:56,640
a blank sheet of paper.

201
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:58,880
A blank sheet of paper?

202
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:02,560
Sorry.

203
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:03,720
Maybe

204
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,520
our thoughts are not on the same level.

205
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:07,600
You don't understand my words.

206
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,520
It's okay.

207
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:10,160
I heard from the matchmaker

208
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,680
that you've never had a boyfriend.

209
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,040
So right now,

210
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,440
you're still...

211
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:29,280
I like your silly look.

212
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:30,800
So,

213
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:33,080
let your hair grow.

214
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:35,120
Because

215
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,840
I like girls with long hair.

216
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:50,740
(Tang Xin)

217
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:57,520
Hello, Xin. You finally called me.

218
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:58,920
Danyang, what happened?

219
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:00,720
I'll tell you later.

220
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:01,880
Where are you right now?

221
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:03,160
I'm at Xingcheng Mall.

222
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:05,280
Great, I'm nearby.

223
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:06,400
Right under it,

224
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,920
at Lanxin Western Restaurant.

225
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,400
Come find me.

226
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,000
Okay, I'm coming.

227
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:14,400
Where shall we go?

228
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:25,680
Sorry.

229
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:27,960
What's going on?

230
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,360
Sorry, I didn't know it was you.

231
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,680
I thought you were a bad guy.

232
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:35,520
It's fine, it's fine.

233
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:36,440
Good that you're fine.

234
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,560
Did you do it on purpose?

235
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:41,480
I didn't. It was just an accident.

236
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:45,040
Is your hand okay?

237
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:46,400
What are you doing?

238
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,360
- Let me take a look.
- What's your problem?

239
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:50,200
I've put up with you all night.

240
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:51,800
At such a nice place,

241
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:52,960
with such good food,

242
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,560
why do you have to disgust me?

243
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,000
Can't you just enjoy a meal?

244
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,520
- I...
- What?

245
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:58,720
Answer me,

246
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,240
how old are you this year?

247
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,320
Have you ever worked?

248
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:02,440
Have you ever paid taxes

249
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:03,440
or made any contribution?

250
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,680
You rely on your parents' money to get by.

251
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:06,960
And you have the nerve to judge others?

252
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:08,360
- You...
- The first time meeting a girl,

253
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:09,480
and you dare to get physical?

254
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,160
Who gave you the courage?

255
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:12,360
Was it Liang Jingru?

256
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:18,720
I'll transfer the meal money to you.

257
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,010
I don't want to owe you anything.

258
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:21,040
Also,

259
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:23,160
I advise you to stop blind dating.

260
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:26,000
With your build,

261
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,040
you won't survive many beatings.

262
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:31,000
Let yourself off.

263
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,440
Danyang, listen to me.

264
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:40,640
You, you, you...

265
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:42,480
You don't need to go.

266
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:48,680
Danyang.

267
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:04,240
♪Love really takes courage♪

268
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:09,080
♪To face the gossip♪

269
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:13,040
Eat slowly, eat slowly.

270
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:14,960
Western food didn't fill me up.

271
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:16,640
It's tasty? Eat more.

272
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,600
Who introduced you to him?

273
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,120
My mom.

274
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,680
Do you know? He's the type

275
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:26,920
who's been trying for five years

276
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,000
to get into grad school.

277
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,240
A typical average guy, you know?

278
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,320
Alright, alright, calm down.

279
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:33,480
Eat some more.

280
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:36,160
Why aren't you home at night?

281
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,280
What are you doing here?

282
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:39,680
Danyang.

283
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:41,840
Can I stay at your place tonight?

284
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:45,560
Take it easy.

285
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,040
The girls in our team

286
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:48,960
are really tough.

287
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:50,400
I need to keep up.

288
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,200
You're comparing yourself to them?

289
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:54,240
How old are you? How old are they?

290
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:55,320
Look at you.

291
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:56,600
Your knee is injured,

292
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:57,600
and also your shoulders.

293
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:58,840
What's wrong?

294
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:00,480
No matter how old you are, you need to train.

295
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,560
As long as I'm still wearing this uniform,

296
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:04,320
I'll keep training.

297
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:09,000
I attended a lecture the other day.

298
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,320
They said that

299
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:13,080
after giving birth,

300
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:16,240
a woman's body is being reshaped.

301
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:19,760
Old injuries like yours might heal.

302
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,280
- Hello.
- Captain Zhu.

303
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:32,400
We've got a situation.

304
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,080
Alright, I'll be there soon.

305
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:36,560
We have a mission. I'm leaving.

306
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:37,480
Okay.

307
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:38,880
Be careful.

308
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:49,080
Sorry, sorry.

309
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:50,120
I'm really sorry.

310
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:51,760
I'll make sure to teach her well

311
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,160
when she gets back.

312
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:55,680
Okay, I'll take you out to eat sometime.

313
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:56,840
I'm back.

314
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,380
- Liu Danyang!
- Uncle.

315
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,560
Come here right now.

316
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:00,440
Sit down, sit down.

317
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:01,610
- Tang Xin is here.
- Auntie.

318
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,920
Have a seat. Liu, prepare some fruit.

319
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,960
- Alright.
- No trouble.

320
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:08,880
I'm in a bad mood today.

321
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,180
Xin will keep me company tonight.

322
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:12,000
You still dare to be in a bad mood?

323
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,560
Welcome, welcome.

324
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:16,480
Auntie, sorry for the trouble.

325
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,460
- Don't be so polite here.
- Have some water, Xin.

326
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,320
Why can't I have a daughter

327
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:22,520
so obedient like you?

328
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:25,600
Compared to Tang Xin,

329
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,560
you're like a monkey.

330
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,280
Like mother, like daughter.

331
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:32,160
I must have been born from a monkey.

332
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,560
How disrespectful!

333
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,320
Well,

334
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:39,400
now you're so agile.

335
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:41,920
Where's your girly side?

336
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:43,800
Meeting someone for the first time

337
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:45,080
and you knocked him over.

338
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:46,040
You know,

339
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:48,360
that kid's back turned all bruised.

340
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:50,080
He sneaked up from behind, trying

341
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:51,280
to put his hand on my shoulder.

342
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:52,640
I thought he was a pervert.

343
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,160
I misunderstood you?

344
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,680
You didn't recognize him?

345
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,960
I can't see behind me.

346
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:00,320
It's impossible!

347
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:03,040
If you can't even recognize that,

348
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:05,000
the Hummer Commandos wouldn't want you.

349
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,080
Tell me,

350
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,160
was it intentional?

351
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,000
Mrs. Lin,

352
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:10,760
don't say it out loud,

353
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:13,160
and then we can still be friends.

354
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:15,400
Get lost.

355
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:16,840
Who is your friend?

356
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:18,160
How disrespectful.

357
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:22,040
I still prefer Tang Xin.

358
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:23,840
The fruit is here.

359
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:25,200
Here, here, here.

360
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,040
- Fruit.
- Tang...

361
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:26,890
Here.

362
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,180
- Eat a big one.
- You eat.

363
00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:30,420
I'll eat.

364
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:31,520
Is it your turn to eat?

365
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:32,640
You eat, you eat.

366
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,110
- Tang Xin, eat.
- Thank you, Uncle.

367
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:35,760
You eat one too.

368
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:51,640
Same time tomorrow.

369
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:53,280
Same place.

370
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,960
Congratulations on your debut today.

371
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:21,160
This is for you.

372
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,120
From now on, we're brothers.

373
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:33,600
Xin.

374
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:34,680
How are we going to face

375
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:36,400
these relatives in the future?

376
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,600
Your dad and I are almost 60.

377
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:40,080
How are we supposed

378
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,280
to face people?

379
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:42,200
Mom.

380
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,320
I need to live up to this uniform.

381
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,520
Then what about us?

382
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,480
Enough, don't say anything more.

383
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:48,520
It's my fault.

384
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:50,400
It's my fault for being useless.

385
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:53,160
I talk big, brag,

386
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,240
and am cocky.

387
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:56,480
I deserve to be humiliated!

388
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,040
Dad, what are you doing, Dad?

389
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,520
I, Tang Dahai,

390
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:00,520
have been useless all my life.

391
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:02,040
No one respected me.

392
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:04,520
I thought now that my daughter is successful,

393
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,880
I could hold my head up high.

394
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:10,800
But it's not my destiny.

395
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:14,240
Dad.

396
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:25,480
What's wrong? Can't sleep?

397
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:29,600
I'm not sleepy.

398
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:33,000
You're crying.

399
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:34,600
No.

400
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:36,600
Danyang.

401
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:39,240
Your parents treat you so well.

402
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,640
Not that well.

403
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:45,880
I knew something was off with you today.

404
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:53,040
Did your parents ask you to use connections

405
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:55,000
to release your cousin?

406
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:56,280
And you refuse it.

407
00:22:58,300 --> 00:22:59,560
People say you're slow to react.

408
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,280
I don't think so at all.

409
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:04,480
Still waters run deep.

410
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:06,880
A lot of things aren't worth my concern.

411
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:09,560
Xin.

412
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:10,680
I think sometimes you just

413
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:12,080
think too much.

414
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:14,680
You're still young. Relax a little.

415
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:16,720
You don't understand.

416
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:18,520
You grew up in a home

417
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:19,600
full of love.

418
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,480
Your parents love you too, don't they?

419
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:26,160
Yeah.

420
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:30,040
But it's just too stressful.

421
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:33,280
My mom has poor health,

422
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,920
and she hardly ever works.

423
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:38,560
The whole family depends on my dad alone

424
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:39,480
to earn money.

425
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:42,920
We are just an ordinary family

426
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:43,880
with average conditions.

427
00:23:44,310 --> 00:23:45,160
But my parents never

428
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:46,080
let me suffer.

429
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,880
The things other kids had,

430
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:49,040
I always had them too.

431
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,440
They endured so much hardship

432
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:53,600
and gave so much.

433
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:55,880
But the more they do this,

434
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,240
the more pressure I feel.

435
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,240
I can't meet their expectations.

436
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:03,180
I don't want to disappoint them either.

437
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:04,720
Parental love

438
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,760
is never about asking for anything in return.

439
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,240
You don't need to repay them.

440
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,440
But you haven't seen

441
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:14,480
the way they look at me.

442
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:16,280
Sometimes,

443
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:18,340
it even seems like
they're fawning or flattering me.

444
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,280
I feel like I'm

445
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:22,480
an egg that carries high expectations.

446
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:24,520
An egg?

447
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,360
They can't fly themselves,

448
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:29,680
so they incubated an egg in the nest.

449
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,280
They worked so hard

450
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:32,640
to bring the egg out,

451
00:24:33,910 --> 00:24:35,000
and can't wait for the next day

452
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,240
to see it fly up to the sky.

453
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,360
Have you talked to them about this?

454
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,120
No, not yet.

455
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:44,760
Then why are you overthinking it?

456
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:46,880
You need to talk to them.

457
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,160
Just say it out loud.

458
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:50,000
My parents

459
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,640
keep asking me to go on blind dates.

460
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:53,040
It's so annoying.

461
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:56,000
Or I'll let you have Eric.

462
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:58,860
I don't want him.
I'm not a blank sheet of paper.

463
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:00,040
You keep him.

464
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:02,440
♪Love really takes courage♪

465
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:04,240
Stop it.

466
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:05,600
Stop it.

467
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:07,400
Go to sleep, go to sleep.

468
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:08,320
Don't overthink.

469
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:09,400
I know.

470
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:43,640
Everyone.

471
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:44,800
Take a break.

472
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:46,320
Assemble in 15 minutes.

473
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:29,400
Alright.

474
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:30,440
Take a break.

475
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,120
Why can't I aim properly?

476
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:34,200
Tata.

477
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:35,720
Teach me some tricks.

478
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:36,960
How do you aim so well?

479
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:38,960
How should I say it?

480
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:41,200
It's not that difficult.

481
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:44,240
Your driving skills are pretty good, right?

482
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:46,600
Just treat the gun

483
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:48,160
like a steering wheel.

484
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:50,760
Think about how you drive.

485
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:52,360
It should work.

486
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:53,800
Really?

487
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:57,640
I guess so.

488
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:00,280
Anyway, practice makes perfect.

489
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:01,560
But,

490
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:03,160
you need to balance work and rest.

491
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:04,880
Got it.

492
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:06,120
Okay, take a break.

493
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:07,360
The second round is soon.

494
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:09,000
Let's go.

495
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:44,360
How do you want to pay?

496
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:46,360
I'll pay you via WeChat.

497
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:47,280
Okay, okay.

498
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,840
Your prices are quite reasonable.

499
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:53,160
Next time, if I have any

500
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:54,480
old furniture or appliances,

501
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:55,380
I'll save them for you.

502
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:56,520
Okay, thank you.

503
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:57,440
You're welcome.

504
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:58,800
Sir.

505
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:00,520
I need to ask you

506
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,680
something.

507
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:04,640
Have you seen this young man?

508
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:09,560
I haven't seen him.

509
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:10,840
No.

510
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:12,480
Alright, see you.

511
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:25,560
Hey,

512
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:27,640
I'm back.

513
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,360
You didn't come back all this time

514
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,680
to visit your mom and dad.

515
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:34,440
I'm back, Mom.

516
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:36,560
Okay, okay.

517
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:39,880
Son.

518
00:28:41,470 --> 00:28:42,360
- Li Hao.
- Dad.

519
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:43,400
Our son is back.

520
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:44,320
I'm back.

521
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:49,880
It's good that you're back.

522
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,320
You've lost weight.

523
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,320
Why are you so thin, son?

524
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:00,690
(Surveillance, East of Chengxi Road)
Captain Zhu.

525
00:29:00,690 --> 00:29:02,840
This is the last footage they appeared in.

526
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:04,440
We can't find anything after that.

527
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:08,960
This makes it even more suspicious.

528
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,520
They must have planned the route in advance,

529
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:13,080
and avoided these cameras specifically.

530
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:15,000
Let's check the arcade footage.

531
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:19,660
(Monitor 1)

532
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:20,600
This one.

533
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:24,780
(Monitor 1)

534
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:27,380
(Inside the arcade)

535
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:50,380
I think we should do this.

536
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:52,960
Let's all clear our minds

537
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:54,640
and take a day off.

538
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:55,530
Where are we going?

539
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:57,320
- Where?
- Play video games.

540
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:59,320
I just love eating the sausages you make.

541
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:01,360
It's been a while.

542
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:03,400
- Wait for Dad to bring some fresh ones.
- I'm back.

543
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:06,060
- You're back.
- You bought so much stuff.

544
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:07,680
Son, go and rest.

545
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:08,680
I'll help your mom.

546
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:09,920
Dad, you've worked all day.

547
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,000
Go rest, I'll handle it.

548
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,040
I'm not tired.

549
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:13,320
Once you're back,

550
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:14,920
I don't feel tired anymore.

551
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:15,960
Sit down and rest.

552
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:17,040
I'll go handle it.

553
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:18,080
Son.

554
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:20,400
This time,

555
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:22,390
you're not leaving, right?

556
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:24,960
Dad.

557
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:27,480
Collecting appliances is too exhausting.

558
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:28,800
Don't do it anymore.

559
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:29,720
It's not exhausting.

560
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:32,200
While I still have some strength,

561
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:33,640
I'll save some money for you.

562
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:34,840
When you start a family...

563
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:36,200
Why are you saving money for me?

564
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:37,200
If you have money, can't you

565
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,160
buy yourself something nice?

566
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:39,240
Take care of yourself.

567
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:41,320
You're not living this life for me.

568
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:45,560
Right, right, right.

569
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:46,800
Right, son.

570
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:47,720
I was wrong.

571
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:51,640
He doesn't like it
when you admit your mistakes.

572
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:52,840
How do you forget again?

573
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:55,360
I was wrong.

574
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:56,640
I won't say I'm wrong again.

575
00:30:56,650 --> 00:30:57,560
Look.

576
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:59,240
You did it again.

577
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:01,120
Why can't you learn?

578
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:02,440
So stupid.

579
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:03,760
Look at my mouth.

580
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:08,360
Son.

581
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:10,200
What's wrong?

582
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:11,610
Where do you feel uncomfortable?

583
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:13,440
Son.

584
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:14,720
I was wrong.

585
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:16,520
You...

586
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:19,600
It's fine.

587
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:22,080
I just suddenly think

588
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,120
Dad is pretty cute.

589
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:27,880
I didn't cherish it before

590
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:30,120
and always tangled with myself.

591
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:33,520
What were you tangled with?

592
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:35,280
I didn't get it.

593
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:38,400
Enough.

594
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:39,440
We're not educated.

595
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:40,620
Our son is a university student.

596
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:42,160
It's normal that we don't understand it.

597
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:43,040
Right, son?

598
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:48,080
Alright.

599
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:49,360
Let's stop talking about it.

600
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:50,960
Mom, let's go cook.

601
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:52,920
I don't need your help.

602
00:31:53,110 --> 00:31:54,040
There's too much smoke.

603
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:54,910
Go rest outside.

604
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:56,600
I'll stay here and keep you company.

00:32:57,940 --> 00:33:02,740

Fair and virtuous maiden;
A gentleman's worthy pursuit.

When you meet a girl you like,

608
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:08,560
you can boldly pursue her.

609
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:09,720
But you can't

610
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:11,840
touch her

611
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:12,840
without her consent.

612
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,800
That could break the law

613
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:16,080
and considered sexual harassment.
