is there anywhere else that hurts?

Where does it hurt?

00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,280
Mom.

34
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,440
I was wrong.

35
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:25,320
Lin.

36
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,160
Mom.

37
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,600
Lin!

38
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:31,360
My child.

39
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:36,790
Mom.

40
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,280
Are you still angry at me?

41
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:44,680
Did you ever miss me

42
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:48,240
all these years?

43
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,640
How could I not miss you?

44
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,120
I wrote you letters,

45
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,600
but you never replied.

46
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:01,760
I never received any letters from you.

47
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:08,160
I always sent them through Ma Tianze.

48
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,480
Then,

49
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,680
you also didn't get

50
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:13,880
the card I sent you?

51
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:16,760
Card?

52
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:20,680
Card...

53
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,040
I'm sorry.

54
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:28,160
I don't remember many things now.

55
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:33,760
Mom, I was wrong.

56
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,320
When I was young,

57
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:39,920
I was too stubborn.

58
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,280
I always wanted to leave home.

59
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,040
I...

60
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,280
Only after becoming a mother myself
did I understand

61
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:51,800
the way you controlled me

62
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,320
and nagged me

63
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:56,680
was because you cared.

64
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:59,080
My mind is not clear now.

65
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:00,920
I can't remember

66
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:02,840
the past.

67
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,120
I only wish

68
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:11,730
to get to see you

69
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:14,320
and your daughter

70
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:17,280
while I can still recognize you.

71
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:23,860
Mom.

72
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:25,980
Zifeng.

73
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:27,140
Come here.

74
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:29,820
Call Grandma.

75
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:32,660
Hello, Grandma.

76
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:34,860
Zifeng.

77
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:37,860
I'm sorry, child.

78
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:39,140
My child.

79
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:40,340
Lin.

80
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:41,900
Lin.

81
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:44,260
Are you alright?

82
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:46,540
Dad.

83
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:47,460
Yeah.

84
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:53,300
Mom.

85
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:55,220
Yes.

86
00:06:57,380 --> 00:06:58,220
Mom,

87
00:06:58,540 --> 00:06:59,460
Xu Zheng has always

88
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:02,620
treated me well these years.

89
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:07,980
Xu Zheng.

90
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:11,540
You've suffered

91
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:13,260
these years.

92
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:16,260
I know

93
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:17,860
you've done everything

94
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:19,580
for this family,

95
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:20,960
and never complained.

96
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:24,400
But I was never satisfied

97
00:07:24,890 --> 00:07:25,940
and always argued with you,

98
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:27,620
always nagging you.

99
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:29,660
I just wanted to prove

100
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:31,300
that my choice back then was right.

101
00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:33,840
I wanted to prove it to my mom,

102
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:37,020
so I kept pressuring you

103
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:38,100
and Zifeng.

104
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:40,540
If I hadn't scolded her today,

105
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:41,860
she wouldn't have left home.

106
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,370
It's all my fault.

107
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:46,300
Lin.

108
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:48,450
You're not wrong.

109
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:50,260
Really.

110
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:52,060
It's my fault for being useless.

111
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:53,660
Really, you married me...

112
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:56,500
I... I...

113
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:58,500
I think you've had it tough, really.

114
00:07:58,500 --> 00:07:59,620
What are you talking about?

115
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:01,820
Back then, I chose you

116
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:03,420
because you were dependable.

117
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:05,820
Because you loved me wholeheartedly.

118
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:08,050
All these years,

119
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:09,460
you've never changed.

120
00:08:10,910 --> 00:08:12,050
The one who changed was me.

121
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:23,940
Mom.

122
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:24,980
Xu Zheng.

123
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:26,660
Zifeng.

124
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:28,220
You all

125
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:29,890
are the most

126
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:31,990
important people in my life.

127
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:33,910
From today on,

128
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:36,500
let's forget the past unhappiness.

129
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:38,500
We'll be together as a family,

130
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:40,460
supporting each other,

131
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:42,040
and live a good life.

132
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,140
Okay.

133
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:56,340
You're back.

134
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:59,620
(No Dumping)

135
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:00,540
An,

136
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:01,980
I haven't seen you in a while.

137
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:02,900
Where've you been?

138
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:04,900
I'm old now.

139
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:06,340
The parts don't work like before.

140
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:08,140
Had to go in for some repairs.

141
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:10,420
Didn't your daughter visit you?

142
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:11,660
She's busy.

143
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:14,060
Why bother with that stuff?

144
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,020
I have no money.

145
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:48,260
You spent it all on booze!

146
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:49,980
You drink all the time!

147
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:51,340
Give it to me!

148
00:09:57,420 --> 00:09:58,620
Don't hit my mom!

149
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:00,740
You little brat!

150
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:01,660
Get lost!

151
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:03,340
- Tata!
- Hand it over!

152
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:09,220
You bit me?

153
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:04,740
Stop! Stop it!

154
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:05,860
Please stop!

155
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:06,860
- Get away!
- Tata!

156
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:08,460
- Stop right there!
- Run, Tata! Run!

157
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:09,380
Stop hitting!

158
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:10,220
Stop it!

159
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:11,550
- Don't ever come back!
- Run!

What's special about Feiyun Mountain?

229
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:04,980
Um...

230
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:06,980
Braised free-range chicken,

231
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:08,740
crispy yellow croaker,

232
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:10,100
hairy tofu.

233
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:11,580
- All food.
- And...

234
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:12,610
All you know is food.

235
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:14,120
Tang Xin was asking about

236
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:15,760
the terrain and vegetation.

237
00:15:16,090 --> 00:15:17,270
Right, Tang Xin?

238
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:19,140
All I can say is,

239
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:20,700
it's a forest.

240
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:24,180
Xin,

241
00:15:24,830 --> 00:15:26,340
our team once supported

242
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:27,340
Feiyun Mountain's firefighting.

243
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:28,260
Weren't you there?

244
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:31,500
I hadn't joined the team yet.

245
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:32,820
She was still so young.

246
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:34,360
- Right.
- I forgot.

247
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:35,380
You old woman.

248
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:37,020
Shut up!

249
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:38,580
Deep in Feiyun Mountain,

250
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:39,800
the terrain's quite complex.

251
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:41,420
Last time's wildfire started

252
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:43,500
because a hiker got lost

253
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:45,290
and lit a fire overnight.

254
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:46,380
You'll see when we go.

255
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:47,420
Okay.

256
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:50,100
Mai and I went once in school days.

257
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,060
She had just got her driver's license,

258
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:55,190
then she took her dad's car out

259
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:57,040
and took me for a ride
on mountain roads.

260
00:15:57,170 --> 00:15:58,660
Mountain roads, you know?

261
00:15:58,660 --> 00:15:59,700
She's got guts.

262
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:01,620
And she always
pretends to be a princess.

263
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:03,740
Then why'd you ride with me?

264
00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:05,940
I had sweaty palms the whole time.

265
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:06,860
And you

266
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:07,940
were sleeping soundly

267
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:09,660
and snoring in the passenger seat.

268
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:10,930
I was impressed.

269
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:13,460
You're both bold, honestly.

270
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:14,940
You should've met me earlier.

271
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:16,140
I'd have driven you.

272
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:17,740
It's still not too late, right?

273
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,620
There's a fee if we
go on a private trip.

274
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:21,260
- 50 yuan per person.
- Stop right there.

275
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:22,220
We'll take a taxi.

276
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:27,380
You're done eating?

277
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:29,060
She didn't eat anything.

278
00:16:30,810 --> 00:16:31,700
What's up with her?

279
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:32,620
No idea.

280
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:34,380
Come on, eat.

281
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:35,370
Alright, alright.

282
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:41,140
Tata.

283
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:42,540
Tata.

284
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:45,460
Captain.

285
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:46,820
Running alone and didn't call me?

286
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:49,460
Captain.

287
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:51,220
An Guosheng is sick.

288
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:54,060
You went to see him?

289
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:55,780
He didn't see me.

290
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:58,860
So what are you thinking?

291
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:23,540
My mom says he's not a bad guy.

292
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:28,900
Back then, my grandma was upset

293
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:30,940
because I wasn't a boy.

294
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:34,140
But my mom had health issues

295
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:36,020
and couldn't have more kids.

296
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,300
She told An Guosheng
to find someone else.

297
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:44,980
But he never messed around outside.

298
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:48,380
He didn't remarry after the divorce.

299
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:54,820
He's been a macho man his whole life,

300
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:56,940
never bowed his head to anyone.

301
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:04,100
But yesterday,

302
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:07,020
I saw him cry.

303
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:18,900
Growing up,

304
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:21,380
it was the first time I saw him cry.

305
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:30,980
So

306
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,350
what are you going to do?

307
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:37,220
I don't know.

308
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:41,580
But I won't soften.

309
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:45,420
Otherwise,

310
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:47,820
how would the sufferings

311
00:18:48,030 --> 00:18:49,630
my mom and I endured

312
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:51,300
all these years count?

313
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:56,780
And how about my persistence

314
00:18:58,740 --> 00:18:59,660
all these years?

315
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:07,300
Tata.

316
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:09,020
I think

317
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:13,180
persistence takes courage,

318
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:15,140
but letting go

319
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:17,780
takes even more.

320
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:21,380
Captain.

321
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:23,300
You always speak in riddles.

322
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:26,260
I don't really get it.

323
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:10,540
(Happiness)

324
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:05,660
Group B, keep following.

325
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:08,620
(Information Center)

326
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:10,680
Captain Zhu, I've sent the photos
to the information center.

327
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:12,260
Okay.

328
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:15,660
No matter how deeply they hide,

329
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:18,120
they can't remain hidden forever.

330
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:21,340
This Wu seems quite capable.

331
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:22,940
Although he can't show up,

332
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:24,720
he hasn't delayed selling goods at all.

333
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:28,100
He couldn't have done this by himself.

334
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:30,860
I want to see

335
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:34,180
who in Binjiang is helping him.

336
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:54,200
Hurry, she's still breathing.

337
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:09,420
(Supermarket Entrance)

338
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:13,980
Hello.

339
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:15,380
Are you Chen Yan?

340
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:16,980
Who are you?

341
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:20,980
(Police)
Please come with us.

342
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:29,780
Hello?

343
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:32,900
Okay.

344
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:33,820
I'll be there soon.

345
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:37,380
(Emergency Response Training Base)

346
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:40,180
(Dormitory)
Wow, looks so good!

347
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:42,460
(Lin Wanru, An Tata, Mai Jialing,
Tang Xin, Liu Danyang)

348
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:44,100
Your eyeliner went out of bounds.

349
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:45,020
Don't move.

350
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:49,900
Tata.

351
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:51,420
Can I borrow your big bag?

352
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:52,340
This one doesn't fit.

353
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:53,700
So pretty, so pretty.

354
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:54,620
It looks really nice.

355
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:57,060
Help me check my eyeliner.

356
00:24:57,460 --> 00:24:58,300
It's fine, it's fine.

357
00:24:58,300 --> 00:24:59,220
No problem.

358
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:02,780
Wanru, lend me the setting spray.

359
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:05,020
So happy!

360
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:06,540
Finally, we can go out and play!

361
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:09,260
But it feels more like

362
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:10,780
we just go out in civilian clothes

363
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:13,980
to get familiar with the terrain
if Captain and her husband

364
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:15,020
come along.

365
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:17,060
Be grateful.

366
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:19,420
As long as we can go hiking,
it's already great.

367
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:20,780
It's not that far, right?

368
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:22,540
It's only 120 kilometers.

369
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:26,060
How is it? Almost packed?

370
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:27,380
Captain.

371
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:31,260
Isn't Captain Zhu coming with us?

372
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:32,340
- Why didn't he come?
- Oh.

373
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:34,140
He has work to do today, can't come.

374
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:36,020
Being a cop is tough,

375
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:37,620
especially if the spouse of a cop

376
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:38,540
is still a cop.

377
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:39,900
Are you speaking in riddles?

378
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:43,820
Take a photo of me.

379
00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:44,820
- Captain.
- Yeah.

380
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:46,460
Chen Yun'er's mom
is on a business trip.

381
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:48,780
I told her we're going
to Feiyun Mountain.

382
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:50,620
She seems really eager to go.

383
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:51,820
Call her to join us.

384
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:52,780
We can play together.

385
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:53,740
Well,

386
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:54,740
isn't that inconvenient?

387
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:56,660
Ask them.

388
00:25:56,860 --> 00:25:58,480
Is it convenient
for Chen Yun'er to come?

389
00:25:58,540 --> 00:25:59,820
- Yeah.
- Sure.

390
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:01,660
- Call her.
- Okay.

391
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:03,060
Then I'll reply to her.

392
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:05,580
Hurry, the car's here.

393
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:06,580
Hurry, hurry, hurry!

394
00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:07,500
Gonna grab something.

395
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:13,140
(Dormitory)

396
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:38,780
Mom.

397
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:41,140
Mom.

398
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:43,460
Mom.

399
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:46,080
Mom.

400
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:48,470
Mom, Mom.

401
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:50,260
Wipe your hands.

402
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:53,260
I'll sit here and wait for you.

403
00:26:53,260 --> 00:26:54,660
That's someone else's mom.

404
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:55,700
Come, let's wipe hands.

405
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:58,140
Alright, what do you have to say?

406
00:26:58,340 --> 00:26:59,420
Thanks, Mom.

407
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:00,500
You're welcome.

408
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:03,060
Alright, let's head out.

409
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:04,420
Let's go.

410
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:05,340
Let's go!

411
00:27:10,770 --> 00:27:12,190
Thank you, Mom!

412
00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:14,340
I love you the most, Mom!

413
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:22,340
This one's tasty.

414
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:23,540
I want one!

415
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:24,700
- Me too!
- I want one too!

416
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:26,900
Take a bite.

417
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:29,860
Hello, Yun'er.

418
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:32,700
We're almost there.

419
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:34,820
Yeah, take your time. No rush.

420
00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:36,300
I'll send you the location.

421
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:38,380
Okay, see you in a bit.

422
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:41,100
See you in a bit.

423
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:44,380
The scenery here is really beautiful.

424
00:27:44,690 --> 00:27:46,020
- So happy!
- The view is amazing.

425
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:47,620
We're out to have some fun.

426
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:49,140
Let's take a selfie together.

427
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:50,420
One, two, three.

428
00:27:58,440 --> 00:27:59,500
- Let's do it too.
- No.

429
00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:00,580
The injured is Wang Yutian.

430
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:02,820
She worked as a receptionist
at a beauty salon.

431
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:04,980
Five years ago, she was

432
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:05,900
forcibly sent to rehab.

433
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:08,340
This man is Luo Ziming.

434
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:09,540
He is Wang Yutian's boyfriend.

435
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:11,980
He often visits the place
where she rents.

436
00:29:12,330 --> 00:29:13,380
In the morning of the incident,

437
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:14,740
a camera near her residence

438
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:16,900
captured Luo Ziming
appearing in the area.

439
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:18,220
And a neighbor said she heard

440
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:19,500
Wang Yutian arguing

441
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:20,820
with a man that night.

442
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:22,020
It was very loud.

443
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:23,620
The criminal police team assumed

444
00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:24,540
that Luo Ziming

445
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:25,680
attacked her with a knife.

446
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:26,700
Have you found him?

447
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:27,580
Not yet.

448
00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:28,980
- He has a drug history?
- No.

449
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:29,900
Captain Zhu.

450
00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:31,780
Captain Zhu.

451
00:29:31,780 --> 00:29:33,020
We've found Luo Ziming.

452
00:29:33,780 --> 00:29:34,780
Let's question him first.

453
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:36,300
- Okay.
- Alright.

454
00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:39,380
Officer, I really
didn't mean to kill her.

455
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:41,140
We were just arguing.

456
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:42,340
She wanted to break up with me.

457
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:43,500
I didn't want to.

458
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:45,340
That still doesn't justify stabbing her.

459
00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:47,580
I didn't mean to stab her.

460
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:49,020
I brought that knife

461
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:50,620
to kill myself.

462
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:52,420
At the time, I thought

463
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:54,060
if she insisted on breaking up,

464
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:55,560
I'd kill myself in front of her.

465
00:29:56,820 --> 00:29:57,820
You know,

466
00:29:57,820 --> 00:29:58,900
I loved her so much.

467
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:01,260
How could she bear to leave me?

468
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:03,380
She cursed at me,

469
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:05,420
called me useless,

470
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:06,540
said I was a loser.

471
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:09,060
She said

472
00:30:09,260 --> 00:30:10,660
she'd rather die than be with me.

473
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:13,660
I lost control when she said that.

474
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:15,140
And that knife

475
00:30:15,140 --> 00:30:16,820
somehow ended up in her.

476
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:18,260
According to you,

477
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:19,980
your relationship had been good.

478
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:21,700
So what happened exactly

479
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:23,620
to make Wang Yutian want to leave you?

480
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:26,740
About...

481
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:28,580
About a month ago,

482
00:30:29,380 --> 00:30:31,420
Yutian suddenly started spending a lot.

483
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:33,180
She bought loads of luxury items,

484
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:36,540
clothes, bags, shoes.

485
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:37,420
So I asked her

486
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:38,620
where did she get the money,

487
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:39,660
but she wouldn't tell me.

488
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:42,220
Then she kept buying stuff.

489
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:44,660
I figured she was seeing someone else,

490
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:46,620
someone rich.

491
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:49,180
I'm not ashamed to admit,

492
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:52,220
even though she treated me that way,

493
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:54,260
I still loved her.

494
00:30:55,140 --> 00:30:56,540
I wanted to be with her forever.

495
00:30:58,380 --> 00:30:59,300
Honestly,

496
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:00,900
I even picked names

497
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:01,820
for our children.

498
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:04,620
Now that she's gone,

499
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:06,580
I don't want to live anymore!

500
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:09,540
Officer, just shoot me!

501
00:31:09,540 --> 00:31:10,540
Enough, enough.

502
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:11,460
Who told you she died?

503
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:13,140
Huh?

504
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:14,460
She's out of danger now.

505
00:31:24,660 --> 00:31:25,660
Don't go too close.

506
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:26,700
Back up! Back up!

507
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:29,020
Look! It's so beautiful.

508
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:31,140
Check this out.

509
00:31:33,010 --> 00:31:33,880
Look behind.

510
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:34,980
Let me take a photo of you.

511
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:37,140
Wow, it looks amazing!

512
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:38,060
Here.

513
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:42,780
Wow, so many swans!

514
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:44,380
Look! Isn't it pretty?

515
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:45,300
Over there.

516
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:49,170
- So many of them!
- Let's go.

517
00:31:49,170 --> 00:31:50,740
Isn't it pretty, Diandian?

518
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:53,860
Wow, so many of them!

519
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:55,380
Look!

520
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:56,420
Wow.

521
00:31:56,660 --> 00:31:58,180
So beautiful.

522
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:02,580
This one.

523
00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:04,420
I took many photos.

524
00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:05,840
Diandian, I...

525
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:07,300
Diandian.

526
00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:09,300
Diandian!

527
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:10,700
Diandian!

528
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:12,820
Diandian!

529
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:14,540
- What's wrong?
- Diandian.

530
00:32:14,540 --> 00:32:16,220
My daughter, my daughter is missing!

531
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:17,300
What's her name?

532
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:18,540
Her name is Chen Ruitong.

533
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:19,620
Her nickname is Diandian.

534
00:32:20,420 --> 00:32:21,340
Diandian.

535
00:32:21,780 --> 00:32:22,860
Diandian.

536
00:32:24,510 --> 00:32:25,590
So many!

537
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:27,020
So beautiful.

538
00:32:27,140 --> 00:32:28,180
Diandian!

539
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:29,500
Everyone, come here!

540
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:30,500
Her daughter is missing.

541
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:31,540
Please help find her.

542
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:33,300
- Have you seen a little kid?
- Come, help out!

543
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:35,660
- Diandian.
- Diandian.

544
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:37,140
What's wrong? Let's go check.

545
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:37,980
- Diandian.
- Go.

546
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:38,900
Diandian.

547
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:41,900
Diandian.

548
00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:44,700
Have you seen a child?

549
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:45,700
Everyone, help out.

550
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:46,620
Diandian.

551
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:48,620
- Diandian.
- Did you see her just now?

552
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:50,500
Diandian, she's three years old.

553
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:52,500
Hello, we are the police.
What happened?

554
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:54,140
My daughter is missing!

555
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:55,900
Okay, don't worry. Speak slowly.

556
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:57,980
My daughter was just here.

557
00:32:57,980 --> 00:32:59,780
She's wearing a pink dress.

558
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:01,580
She is this tall.

559
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:03,300
- Her look?
- She wears a pink dress,

560
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:04,980
has two braids. Please

561
00:33:05,140 --> 00:33:06,140
help me find her.

562
00:33:06,140 --> 00:33:07,780
- Okay.
- Diandian.

563
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:09,300
Diandian.

564
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:10,780
We will help you find her.

565
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:11,980
Thank you, thank you.

566
00:33:11,980 --> 00:33:12,820
Everyone, split up.

00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:14,260
Diandian!

568
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:15,980
Diandian!

569
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:18,140
Diandian!

570
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:20,360
Diandian!

(Surveillance)

572
00:33:30,780 --> 00:33:31,620
Diandian.

573
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:32,540
That's Diandian.

574
00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:35,200
- She was with that woman.
- This one at the South Gate?

575
00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:36,540
The one in pink.

576
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:38,820
- Don't worry.
- Captain.

577
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:40,400
I've already contacted the local police.

578
00:33:40,660 --> 00:33:41,580
Okay.

579
00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:49,700
Is it tasty?

580
00:33:50,140 --> 00:33:51,060
Yes.

581
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:54,780
Here.

582
00:33:54,780 --> 00:33:56,220
Mom, who is she?

583
00:33:57,900 --> 00:33:58,940
Your little brother.

584
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:00,260
How is she my little brother?

585
00:34:00,460 --> 00:34:02,100
She's clearly a little girl.

586
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:04,220
You're wrong.
This is your little brother.

587
00:34:05,860 --> 00:34:07,060
Where's her mother?

588
00:34:07,060 --> 00:34:08,660
Why are you so nice to her?

589
00:34:09,660 --> 00:34:10,580
Qiaoqiao.

590
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:12,340
Did I tell you?

591
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:13,900
You're older than your brother.

592
00:34:14,220 --> 00:34:15,300
You need to be nice to him.

593
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:16,820
That way, when you grow up,

594
00:34:16,820 --> 00:34:18,300
your brother will be kind to you.

595
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:20,900
She's not my brother.

596
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:24,340
Qiaoqiao.

597
00:34:26,660 --> 00:34:28,300
(Hundred Fruits Garden)

598
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:29,220
Go.

Attention, dear tourists.

602
00:34:37,180 --> 00:34:39,180
A child is missing in the scenic area.

603
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:41,700
It's suspected that
she may have been abducted.

604
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:45,180
Please make sure
to keep an eye on your children.

605
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:48,300
The missing child
is a three-year-old girl,

606
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:50,380
wearing a pink top,

607
00:34:50,660 --> 00:34:51,940

and white sneakers.

609
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:54,900
Attention, dear tourists.

610
00:34:55,220 --> 00:34:57,780
The missing child

611

614

Qiaoqiao.

615
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:06,980
Look.

616
00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:08,780
Is it your little brother?

617
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:11,420
I want to find my dad.

618
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:12,700
I want to find my dad.

619
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:14,940
Dad will come back.

620
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:18,380
Now, your little brother is back.

621
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:20,540
Our family

622
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:22,940
will never be apart again.

623
00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:35,460
Is this girl the one

624
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:36,780
the officer mentioned?

625
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:39,380
No, that child is older.

626
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:41,500
No, I mean the little one she's holding.

627
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:43,020
What's your observation?

628
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:44,260
That's a boy in a hat.

629
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:45,660
You have sharp eyes.

After domestic violence,

632
00:35:54,940 --> 00:35:55,800
the victim

633
00:35:55,810 --> 00:35:57,340
should go to the hospital immediately.

634
00:35:57,540 --> 00:35:59,140
Take photos of the injuries

635
00:35:59,140 --> 00:36:01,100
and keep any threatening messages,

636
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:03,660
then report to the police
as soon as possible

637
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:05,060
or seek help from the Women's Union.

638

If necessary,

639
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:07,700
apply for a protection order

640
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:09,740
from the People's Court.

641

We must say no to domestic violence.

642
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:13,860
Believe in our own strength

643
00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:15,540
and give the abuser something to fear.
