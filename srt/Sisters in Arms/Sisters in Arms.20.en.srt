What's wrong bro?

25
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,160
Cops know now,

26
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,800
we have to change the plan.

27
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:58,400
Change the plan?

28
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,280
This woman is in our way.

29
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,200
Let's do this.

30
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:10,800
Kill her?

31
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,040
Are you insane?

32
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,280
What else can we do?

33
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,160
Nabbed by the cops.

34
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,280
And we'll both go to jail!

35
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,880
Jail does beat a bullet!

36
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,200
Are you in or not?

37
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,360
I'm out.

38
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:25,520
If you want to do it, do it yourself.

39
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,000
Wu Qiang!

40
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:34,000
Wu Qiang.

41
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:34,920
I'm telling you,

42
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,800
either she dies here today

43
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,080
or

44
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,680
you die here instead.

45
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:44,760
Ma Tianze.

46
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:48,400
I've always seen you as a brother.

47
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,960
Now you're pointing a knife at me?

48
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:54,560
Were you lying to me all along?

49
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,400
All that stuff about the abused kid,

50
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:57,680
her family paying us

51
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,160
to stage a kidnapping,

52
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:00,560
is a lie, right?

53
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,000
And I actually trusted you.

54
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:10,400
Qiang,

55
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:13,000
I did all this for your own good.

56
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,360
Think about it.
Jail means our lives are over.

57
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,700
But with this money,

58
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:19,280
we can do whatever we want.

59
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:20,920
Better than being nobodies forever!

60
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:22,200
That's nonsense!

61
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:24,120
This is murder!

62
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,080
You'll eat a bullet!

63
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,480
Bullet! Do you even get that?

64
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:28,560
You've lost your mind!

65
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:36,680
You're not doing it?

66
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:37,600
Fine.

67
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:38,920
First,

68
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,040
you get nothing.

69
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:41,720
And also,

70
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:42,560
if I go to jail,

71
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,200
you're not getting away either.

72
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:53,840
Are you in?

73
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,080
Get out.

74
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:11,480
Out.

75
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:12,400
Move.

76
00:04:13,370 --> 00:04:14,320
Go.

77
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:15,690
Move.

78
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:18,240
Go.

79
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,520
Move.

80
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,600
Move.

81
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,600
Hello?

82
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,080
Give me the phone.

83
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,120
Oh, okay!

84
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,280
I found it.

85
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,200
Where?

86
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,640
Just right here.

87
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:30,240
I saw a light flashing here,

88
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,260
so I came down to check.

89
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,600
How long since we got the call?

90
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:36,800
16 minutes.

91
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:40,280
Captain.

92
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:41,440
Ahead is mountain road.

93
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,480
No cameras there.

94
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:43,840
Use the drone.

95
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:44,760
Got it.

96
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,520
Hello, Auntie.

97
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:01,240
Don't worry, I'll take good care of her.

98
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,040
Stay inside the hotel

99
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:03,960
and wait for my call.

100
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:05,240
Okay.

101
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,800
Got it. Don't worry.

102
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,320
I gotta go.

103
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,360
She's dead?

104
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,200
One million.

105
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:34,120
You promised me one million.

106
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,280
Ma Tianze.

107
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:39,710
If you lie to me again,

108
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:41,710
I'll kill you too, do you believe me?

109
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:46,120
Relax,

110
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,040
man.

111
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:51,000
I'll keep my promise. Don't worry.

112
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:53,680
Calm down, calm down.

113
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:56,960
Take it easy.

114
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,760
Let's get in the car
and leave this place.

115
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:07,880
Go.

116
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,320
The only passable road

117
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:19,600
runs north-south.

118
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,160
We came from the south to intercept.

119
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,680
The phone was dumped here.

120
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,440
So they must've headed north.

121
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,640
There are two options north.

122
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:28,280
One is National Road 375,

123
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:29,880
the other is the coastal highway.

124
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,040
There's a toll station
at the highway entrance.

125
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,840
Traffic police will be there.

126
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:35,680
He probably won't take that route.

127
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,280
Then he'll use the national road.

128
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,680
Hurry up.

129
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,320
Think carefully again.

130
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,400
How could Chen Lin

131
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,440
not contact her mother at all?

132
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:21,520
I remember once

133
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,680
she sent a New Year's card

134
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:26,280
to her mother.

135
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:30,120
It had a photo of Zifeng inside.

136
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,160
But she never got a reply.

137
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:39,840
So she lost all hope.

138
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,480
There was no point in staying in touch.

139
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,120
Attention, all units.

140
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:48,120
We just found through
the ticketing system

141
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,520
that Chen Lin's mother, Tian Fang,

142
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,720
arrived in Binjiang two days ago.

143
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,480
She's currently staying
at Dinghao Hotel.

144
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:57,560
These incidents must be connected.

145
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:00,000
A wealthy old lady, alone

146
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,360
suddenly arrived in Binjiang

147
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:05,040
and days later, her daughter
and granddaughter are kidnapped.

148
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,280
Could that be a coincidence?

149
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:07,120
Chen Lin's mother

150
00:10:07,130 --> 00:10:09,120
is the perfect extortion target.

151
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:14,380
(Police)

152
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,080
Hello, Auntie, it's me.

153
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,360
Tianze, where are you?

154
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:52,720
When are you coming back?

155
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,360
Auntie.

156
00:10:56,810 --> 00:10:57,920
Something went wrong.

157
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:59,040
What happened?

158
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,600
Is my granddaughter okay?

159
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,320
For now, she's fine.

160
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:05,200
What do you mean, for now?

161
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,920
What exactly happened?

162
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,000
Auntie.

163
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:14,080
Zifeng might be in danger.

164
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,000
What?

165
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:16,640
What kind of danger?

166
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,600
What's going on exactly?

167
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:20,480
The guy I partnered with

168
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,400
is my childhood friend.

169
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,920
We rescued Zifeng together,

170
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:25,400
but he suddenly turned on me.

171
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:27,360
What do you mean?

172
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:29,200
He wants a lot of money.

173
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,840
Otherwise he'll kill her.

174
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:32,920
Didn't I already give you a big sum?

175
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:34,080
Give it to him first.

176
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,880
As long as he lets Zifeng go.

177
00:11:36,010 --> 00:11:37,200
He says it's not enough.

178
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,320
Also,

179
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:40,360
he recorded a video

180
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,220
and let me send it.

181
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:42,170
Hold on.

182
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:47,180
(Photos and Videos)

183
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:48,700
(Auntie)

184
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:55,800
Zifeng.

185
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,200
Zifeng!

186
00:11:58,310 --> 00:11:59,910
No,

187
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:01,960
we have to call the police!

188
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,560
No, Auntie.

189
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:04,720
You can't call the police!

190
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:05,920
Think about it.

191
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,480
Even if you're her grandma,

192
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:09,080
this is still kidnapping.

193
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,120
Wait.

194
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,750
Just think, the police will

195
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:14,760
send Zifeng back home.

196
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,880
And her dad will keep abusing her.

197
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:19,360
That guy just wants money.

198
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:20,720
Trust me.

199
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,400
Once he gets the money,

200
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:25,160
I swear I'll get Zifeng out.

201
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:27,280
Did he name a price?

202
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:29,000
Five million.

203
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,280
Alright. I'll give it.

204
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,360
As long as he lets my granddaughter go.

205
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,040
Go to the foreign bank

206
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:36,680
across from the hotel
to withdraw the money.

207
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:38,160
- Got that?
- Okay, okay!

208
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,080
I'll go now!

209
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:41,160
Well, Tianze,

210
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,920
can you guarantee Zifeng's safety?

211
00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:44,160
Don't worry.

212
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,760
She's safe for now.

213
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,000
Once we have the money,

214
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:50,160
I'll immediately find a way
to get her out.

215
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,600
I'll send your phone the account.

216
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:52,740
Be quick, understand?

217
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:55,000
Okay okay, I'll go now!

218
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,240
Hey.

219
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:00,600
Well,

220
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:01,800
the money's coming soon!

221
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,480
Please don't hurt her!

222
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:04,370
Alright, alright.

223
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:06,200
Tianze, what's wrong?

224
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,120
Well,

225
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,360
how much longer do we wait?

226
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,040
What's the rush? The money's coming.

227
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:16,720
Hello.

228
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:18,030
Are you Ms. Tian Fang?

229
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,760
There's nothing out here.

230
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:46,760
My daughter and granddaughter
have been kidnapped?

231
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:49,720
Ms. Tian, has anyone
contacted you recently,

232
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:50,840
demanding ransom?

233
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:55,230
No.

234
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:59,440
Even if they did,
why would they come to me?

235
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,360
Right?

236
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:03,760
I haven't spoken to my daughter
Chen Lin for over ten years.

237
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:06,480
I didn't even know I had a granddaughter.

238
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:10,200
I'm sorry.

239
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,600
I have something to do today.

240
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,600
I can't talk with you for long.

241
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,040
Ms. Tian.

242
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,000
We just have a few questions.

243
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,160
Please sit down.

244
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:21,320
Go ahead.

245
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:23,080
What brought you

246
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,000
to Binjiang this time?

247
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,320
I heard the scenery is nice here.

248
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,880
I'm here to clear my mind.

249
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:35,160
So where do you plan to go sightseeing?

250
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:36,680
Well...

251
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:41,400
My secretary arranged all that.

252
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:43,640
I can't remember everything.

253
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:48,360
Just now you said you had to go out.

254
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:49,840
Go out?

255
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,720
Did I say that?

256
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,160
Oh right, yes I did.

257
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:02,400
I have something to do.

258
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,240
I have to go now.

259
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,640
Ms. Tian.

260
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,640
I hope you can cooperate with us.

261
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:08,560
This involves

262
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,920
the safety of your daughter
and granddaughter.

263
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:13,600
Look, officer,

264
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,720
didn't I already tell you?

265
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:16,920
Lin

266
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,960
and Zifeng

267
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:21,200
have nothing to do with me anymore.

268
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,920
You mean Xu Zifeng, right?

269
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:26,840
Yes.

270
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,960
But earlier you told us

271
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:30,760
you didn't know you had a granddaughter.

272
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:33,120
So how do you know
her name is Xu Zifeng?

273
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:35,080
How do you explain that?

274
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,320
Didn't one of you just mention it?

275
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,440
No, we didn't.

276
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:49,760
Wanru.

277
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,320
Did you speak with Tian Fang?

278
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:56,960
Yes, Captain.

279
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:58,280
It's very likely

280
00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:59,360
she's gotten a ransom call.

281
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:00,840
We asked a few questions

282
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,240
but she lied to all of them.

283
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,240
There's something else strange.

284
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:07,880
I feel like Tian Fang

285
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:09,560
isn't mentally clear.

286
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:11,600
She speaks very slowly

287
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:14,720
and forgets things in a second.

288
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:16,600
Doesn't seem like she's faking.

289
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:19,360
She might have Alzheimer's,

290
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:20,520
cognitive disorder,

291
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:21,440
or memory gaps.

292
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:22,720
Captain.

293
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,840
The drone is nearly out of range.

294
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:26,280
Nothing found so far.

295
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:53,440
You have no right to touch my things!

296
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,360
Ms. Tian,

297
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:56,120
we're trying to help you.

298
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:58,040
Please don't obstruct our investigation.

299
00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:59,640
That's my personal property!

300
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:00,680
Give it back!

301
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:01,600
Ms. Tian.

302
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:08,040
Why do you have their photos?

303
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:11,360
I care about my granddaughter.

304
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,080
Is that so wrong?

305
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:14,840
It's just human nature.

306
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:15,920
Ms. Tian.

307
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,040
Your granddaughter and daughter

308
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:19,760
are in grave danger.

309
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,440
If you know where they are,

310
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,600
who kidnapped them,

311
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:23,480
or why

312
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:24,600
they were kidnapped,

313
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:26,240
you have to tell us.

314
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:17,400
What are you doing?

315
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,320
Trying to run?

316
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:23,160
Try that again

317
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,360
and I'll send you to your mom,
you hear me?

318
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:27,240
You won't.

319
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:28,480
You won't kill me.

320
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:44,640
Dare you try me?

321
00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:53,680
Could it be that

322
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:55,400
we're going about this the wrong way?

323
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:57,600
After they ditched the phone,

324
00:18:57,820 --> 00:18:59,040
maybe they didn't move forward

325
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:00,840
but turn back.

326
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,280
Sometimes the most dangerous place

327
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,200
is also the safest.

328
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,320
Tata.

329
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:08,430
Try the opposite direction.

330
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:09,440
Roger that.

331
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:23,800
Something off
about the photos.

332
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,360
Look.

333
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,400
Xu Zifeng's head and body

334
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,480
look out of proportion.

335
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:37,040
And the lighting in this one is off too.

336
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:38,080
See?

337
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:41,280
The shadow on her face doesn't
match the light source above.

338
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:45,280
This photo might have
been digitally altered.

339
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:47,880
What?

340
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:49,760
It might be computer-generated.

341
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:50,880
It means they're fake.

342
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,600
We'll send them to technical unit

343
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:54,480
and have them confirm it.

344
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:55,920
And from what we know,

345
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:58,320
Xu Zheng was actually good
to his wife and daughter.

346
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,880
It was Chen Lin who was
stricter with the girl.

347
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:03,640
There were more conflicts
between mother and daughter.

348
00:20:03,790 --> 00:20:04,640
But...

349
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:06,270
But the photos suggest otherwise.

350
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:07,130
Right?

351
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:08,470
Did someone say

352
00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:10,560
Xu Zheng was abusing your granddaughter?

353
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,200
Yes.

354
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:14,280
Who gave you these photos?

355
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:15,120
My nephew.

356
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,190
What's his name?

357
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:18,080
Ma Tianze.

358
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:21,700
(Ma Tianze)

359
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:23,090
(Ma Tianze abused his role
to embezzle over 3.5 million yuan)

360
00:20:23,090 --> 00:20:24,420
(for personal use,
stock grading and gambling)

361
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:40,210
Captain! Found them!

362
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:56,840
Help!

363
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:58,280
Help me!

364
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:06,040
- Officer!
- Are you Chen Lin?

365
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:07,400
Yes, I called the police.

366
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:08,720
You're injured.

367
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:09,600
Don't worry about me.

368
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:11,160
Please save my daughter.

369
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:12,320
Get her bandaged up.

370
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:13,600
Please save my daughter!

371
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,160
Don't worry. We'll find her.

372
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:16,240
Yes, get her treated first.

373
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,160
This way, please.

374
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:21,000
Ma Tianze, male, 30 years old.

375
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
He's the deputy manager
of your mainland branch.

376
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,240
Can you confirm that?

377
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:29,520
Ma Tianze embezzled company funds

378
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:30,760
and accounting found out.

379
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:32,240
Now he's facing prosecution.

380
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:34,920
So he desperately needs money

381
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,320
to fill the hole.

382
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:37,240
What?

383
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:38,940
You didn't know about this?

384
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:40,960
No, I had no idea!

385
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,760
I've been in poor health.

386
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:43,960
I rarely handle

387
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:46,120
business matters.

388
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:52,280
How could he do this?

389
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:56,000
I trusted him so much!

390
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:57,840
Auntie.

391
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:01,600
Didn't you just take your medicine?

392
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,020
Why are you taking more?

393
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:05,200
I already took them?

394
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,120
Yes, you did.

395
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,960
I forgot.

396
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:11,360
Auntie.

397
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:12,280
Let me massage you.

398
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:14,280
Okay.

399
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:18,000
Tianze.

400
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:20,640
I don't have children by my side.

401
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:24,760
Thank you for flying back and forth
to care for me.

402
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:25,800
Auntie,

403
00:22:25,810 --> 00:22:27,210
we're family after all.

404
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:29,800
Just treat me like your own son.

405
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,920
This time I came back to China,

406
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:38,440
I don't want to leave again.

407
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:40,040
I miss Lin.

408
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:43,640
I can't go on never seeing her again.

409
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:47,000
Tianze.

410
00:22:47,130 --> 00:22:48,150
When are we

411
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:49,730
going to see Lin?

412
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:51,680
Auntie.

413
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:53,710
I already told you.

414
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:55,520
Did you forget?

415
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,120
- You told me?
- Yes.

416
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,240
What did you say?

417
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:12,680
This...

418
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:14,960
What happened?

419
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,480
That's Zifeng.

420
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:18,920
And that's her father.

421
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:20,120
I've seen her before.

422
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:21,760
Where did you get the photos?

423
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:23,200
Auntie, don't worry.

424
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,840
I originally went to visit Lin.

425
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:25,960
But she didn't recognize me.

426
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:29,400
Then I happened to see
her husband abusing Zifeng.

427
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:30,520
I told her to get a divorce,

428
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:31,410
but she refused.

429
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:33,320
You know how stubborn she is.

430
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:34,880
Back then, because of this man,

431
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:36,640
she even

432
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,320
cut ties with you.

433
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:39,200
Yeah.

434
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:41,540
So what do we do now?

435
00:23:41,550 --> 00:23:43,600
What should we do, Tianze?

436
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:45,480
Auntie.

437
00:23:46,270 --> 00:23:47,600
You once told me

438
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:49,840
you wanted to bring Zifeng back.

439
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:50,750
Do you remember?

440
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:52,200
I said that?

441
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,120
That's right.

442
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:55,280
But there's one problem.

443
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:57,520
Zifeng is underage.

444
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,800
She needs a guardian's consent.

445
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:01,640
Do you think Lin would agree?

446
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:04,680
So,

447
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:06,000
I came up with a plan.

448
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:07,640
What plan, Tianze?

449
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:09,000
Auntie.

450
00:24:09,170 --> 00:24:10,360
First I will

451
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:13,680
bring Zifeng to stay with me.

452
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:15,520
Then I'll talk to Lin.

453
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:17,960
She's suffered so much
out there all these years.

454
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:18,880
I believe

455
00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:20,040
she'll definitely agree.

456
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:29,440
I don't know where they'd go.

457
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:31,680
Those two

458
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:33,360
don't always agree.

459
00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:34,670
For example?

460
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:36,320
For example...

461
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:37,320
Go.

462
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:39,760
Don't shout. I'm letting you go.

463
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:42,200
Wait till we've left, you can run.

464
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,240
But to convince him,

465
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:49,590
you'll have to suffer a bit.

466
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:51,280
Bear with it.

467
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:54,960
Lie down.

468
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:56,480
Lie down.

469
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:57,880
Don't scream.

470
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01,240
He said this has to be done

471
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:03,080
behind my daughter's back.

472
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:06,280
I've been in poor health.

473
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:07,440
I get

474
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:08,840
confused a lot.

475
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:10,840
So I handed all company matters

476
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:12,620
over to him completely.

477
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:21,260
How could he be like this?

478
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:22,140
(Tianze)

479
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:27,080
Ma Tianze.

480
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,040
Answer it.

481
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:30,040
Keep him talking

482
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:31,640
and drag it out as long as possible.

483
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:33,940
(Tianze)

484
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:36,160
Hello, Auntie.

485
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:37,600
Tianze.

486
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:39,080
Are you alright over there?

487
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:41,440
Have you transferred the money?

488
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:43,040
Oh, right.

489
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:44,060
Transfer the money, right?

490
00:25:44,130 --> 00:25:45,020
Oh dear.

491
00:25:45,030 --> 00:25:47,120
I totally forgot about that.

492
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:49,920
What...

493
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:51,600
You haven't sent the money yet?

494
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,320
Auntie.

495
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:54,320
Listen to me.

496
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:56,240
I can still keep him calm for now.

497
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:58,410
But you need to go downstairs right now

498
00:25:58,560 --> 00:25:59,800
to transfer the money.

499
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:00,720
Got it?

500
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:02,620
Okay okay, I'm going now!

501
00:26:02,630 --> 00:26:03,610
I'm going!

502
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:06,760
Tianze.

503
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,240
What did you just tell me to do?

504
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:11,620
Why can't I remember it again?

505
00:26:13,230 --> 00:26:15,280
Go to the bank across from the hotel.

506
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:16,800
Bring your bag.

507
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,560
Your ID is in there.

508
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:19,400
Got it?

509
00:26:19,410 --> 00:26:21,400
Oh, to the bank downstairs, right?

510
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:23,280
- Right.
- Okay, okay.

511
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,000
How much am I transferring?

512
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:27,480
Five million.

513
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:28,800
Remember? Five million.

514
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:29,640
Okay, okay.

515
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:31,120
I'll transfer five million now.

516
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:32,240
I'm going now.

517
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:33,960
Okay, okay.

518
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:34,880
Auntie.

519
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:38,760
Is someone next to you?

520
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:39,680
Yes.

521
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:40,800
No.

522
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:42,160
I'm alone in the hotel.

523
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:43,280
There's no one else here.

524
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:44,720
I...

525
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:47,080
He hung up.

526
00:26:53,180 --> 00:26:54,020
I...

527
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:58,880
Captain Ye, the phone location shows
near Taoyuan Fourth Road.

528
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,800
(Abandoned Factory)
A barely populated area.

529
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:02,400
There's an abandoned factory there.

530
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:04,920
What's wrong?

531
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:06,240
Why are you holding a knife?

532
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:07,600
I'm gonna kill her.

533
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:09,040
- No! Calm down!
- Move!

534
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:10,640
- Move! I'll kill her!
- Calm down!

535
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:11,520
Calm down!

536
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:12,440
Why?

537
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:13,400
If she lives,

538
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:14,840
we both will die!

539
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:15,800
Move!

540
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,280
Listen to me!

541
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:19,320
I've already killed one.

542
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:20,600
We can't kill this one.

543
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:22,120
If she dies, what about the money?

544
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:25,400
We won't get the money.

545
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:33,840
Right.

546
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:37,760
If she's alive,

547
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:39,080
we still can get money.

548
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:45,680
Either way, we're doomed.

549
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:47,520
Might as well go all in.

550
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:53,400
Get her in the car.

551
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:54,560
We'll go somewhere else.

552
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:55,840
No, listen.

553
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:57,640
If we move now,

554
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:58,960
we're easier to spot.

555
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:01,000
Maybe staying here is safer.

556
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:03,640
Please.

557
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:05,560
As long as she's with us,

558
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:07,120
we still have a chance.

559
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:17,570
Watch her.

560
00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:18,640
Watch her closely.

561
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,520
I'll go check outside.

562
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:49,920
It was my mom
who told Ma Tianze to do this?

563
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:52,960
Your mom probably
just wanted to protect Xu Zifeng.

564
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,640
But she has Alzheimer's disease,

565
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,080
also known as dementia.

566
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:00,040
Her memory and cognition

567
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:01,160
are both impaired.

568
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:04,000
Ma Tianze took advantage of that

569
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:06,320
and of your mom's trust in him.

570
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:12,120
From what my colleague saw,

571
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:14,080
your mom still cares deeply about you.

572
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:24,380
Shh.

573
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:43,960
Hey.

574
00:29:44,180 --> 00:29:45,800
How's it looking outside?

575
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,320
All good. Nothing suspicious.

576
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:49,210
Wait, bro.

577
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:52,880
What?

578
00:29:52,890 --> 00:29:54,640
There's something

579
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:55,720
I've wanted to tell you.

580
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:57,000
What do you want to say?

581
00:29:57,690 --> 00:29:58,840
Thank you

582
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:01,320
for giving me this chance to make money

583
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:03,040
so I could pay off my debts.

584
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:03,880
Not in the mood.

585
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:04,960
Hey bro, listen to me!

586
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:05,880
Bro.

587
00:30:08,070 --> 00:30:08,940
I...

588
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:10,560
Bro! Bro! Bro!

589
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:11,890
- Stop it!
- Get out of the way!

590
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:14,960
Come here!

591
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:17,520
Come here! Now!

592
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:18,440
Let me go!

593
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,680
Calm down! She's just a kid, bro!

594
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:27,690
Bro!

595
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:42,560
If you don't behave,

596
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:44,120
I'll kill you first.

597
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:45,040
Let me go!

598
00:30:45,050 --> 00:30:45,920
Move!

599
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:46,760
- Wait!
- Let go!

600
00:30:46,770 --> 00:30:48,320
- Move!
- Wait!

601
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:49,240
Let her go, bro!

602
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:50,720
- Please!
- Shut up!

603
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:52,200
Let go of me!

604
00:30:56,870 --> 00:30:57,720
- Come here!
- Hey!

605
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:58,810
- Let me go!
- Tianze!

606
00:30:59,850 --> 00:31:00,880
- Bro!
- Let me go!

607
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:01,790
Bro!

608
00:31:02,850 --> 00:31:04,200
Let the kid go!

609
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:05,160
- Come here!
- Help!

610
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:06,010
Let the kid go!

611
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:07,060
Get lost!

612
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:09,000
Come here! Come to me!

613
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:11,560
Let the kid go!

614
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:12,520
You're surrounded!

615
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:13,880
Let me go!

616
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:14,800
Get down!

617
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:16,240
- Stay back!
- Let me go!

618
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:17,760
I have a hostage!

619
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:20,000
Bro,

620
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:20,930
it's all police.

621
00:31:20,930 --> 00:31:21,840
Let's turn ourselves in.

622
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:22,750
Shut up!

623
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:31,160
Go.

624
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:32,170
Bring the car here.

625
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:33,200
Or I'll stab her!

626
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,120
Now!

627
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:35,560
Hurry up!

628
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:38,480
Stay back!

629
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:40,960
Stay back!

630
00:31:45,950 --> 00:31:46,800
Come here!

631
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:47,720
Move!

632
00:31:49,710 --> 00:31:50,990
Come on, quick!

633
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:52,920
Get in.

634
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:54,360
Get in!

635
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:56,180
- In!
- Move aside!

636
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:06,800
Go after them!

637
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:13,800
Zifeng!

638
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:18,280
Zifeng!

639
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:23,280
Hurry!

640
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:24,560
Bro,

641
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:25,440
what now?

642
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:26,360
Just drive!

643
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:33,240
Xin, follow them.

644
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:34,160
Yes!

645
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:40,360
The cops are catching up, bro!

646
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:41,840
- Bro!
- Step on it! Now!

647
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:46,040
- Help!
- Shut up!

648
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:53,080
Faster!

649
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:54,560
I'm going as fast as I can!

650
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:03,880
Faster!

651
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:05,880
Don't move!

652
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:13,440
Run! Get out!

653
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,040
Protect the girl.

654
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:17,280
We'll chase the suspects.

655
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:26,240
There's an injured person.

656
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:27,520
Get him to the hospital.

657
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:51,680
Mom!

658
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:58,840
Mom!

659
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:00,040
Zifeng.

660
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:13,720
Are you alright?

661
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:12,360
Be careful.

663

Some people get their weaknesses

exploited by bad guys,
turning their help into harm.

665
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:13,280
No matter how sincere our intentions,

666
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:15,440
we must understand
the truth of the matter.

667
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:18,080
We can genuinely support those in need

668
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:20,880
only within legal and reasonable limits,

669
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:23,400
and with their consent,

670
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:26,800
