24
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:37,540
Captain Zhu, the result of
Fenghuang Village case is out.

25
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:38,620
Lu Xiaoying's drugs

26
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:40,180
are purer than Zhou Yan's.

27
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:42,320
The composition is similar,
but the quality is better.

28
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:43,780
Okay, I got it.

29
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:50,380
Dajun.

30
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:51,380
Captain Zhu,

31
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:53,140
we've searched the beauty salon.

32
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:55,340
A large amount of drugs were found.

33
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:56,180
They hid the drugs

34
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:57,740
inside the boxes of beauty products.

35
00:01:58,060 --> 00:01:59,060
Everything was seized.

36
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:00,780
But Captain Zhu,

37
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:01,780
the front desk told me

38
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:03,740
Ai Lian went out of town
two days ago.

39
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:05,140
Did you alarm her?

40
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:06,460
No.

41
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:07,940
I had them talk on the phone.

42
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:09,950
She said everything
was operating normally.

43
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:11,580
She might come back in a few days.

44
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:13,170
Okay.

45
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:16,020
Captain Zhu.

46
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:17,140
Chen Yan spoke.

47
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:22,220
Let's go.

48
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:30,700
Wish I could stay another day.

49
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:31,700
I didn't stay long enough.

50
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:32,580
Stay one more day,

51
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:33,860
and you'll eat all the chicken

52
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:35,260
and duck of their house.

53
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:37,460
Still hasn't had it enough.

54
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:39,140
You ate too much.

55
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:46,380
After breakfast,

56
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:47,780
go to the basement.

57
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:49,420
I'll be leaving soon too.

58
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:05,330
During this time,

59
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:06,180
be careful.

60
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:08,220
Don't use that secret passage.

61
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:09,340
It doesn't feel safe.

62
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:12,100
I've thought about it.

63
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,500
We can't stay long in Binjiang.

64
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:16,220
When we have enough money,

65
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:18,420
we'll leave together.

66
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:21,980
Really?

67
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:41,140
You've figured it out?

68
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:54,740
I have.

69
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:57,580
For Yun'er,

70
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,610
I can't be so willful.

71
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:04,900
That's right.

72
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:13,980
Why are you going against money?

73
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:15,460
Isn't that right?

74
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:17,540
Besides, in my line of work,

75
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:18,540
it's always dangerous.

76
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:20,740
If I die,

77
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:23,260
my money

78
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:26,420
will be your money.

79
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:31,020
What are you trying to say?

80
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:34,100
Ai Lian.

81
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:37,720
Only I in this world

82
00:04:37,730 --> 00:04:39,110
know your dark past.

83
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:43,340
So if I die,

84
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:47,980
you can take my money

85
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:50,900
and live a carefree life

86
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:53,940
with your beloved Yun'er.

87
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:58,180
Isn't that what you want?

88
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:01,740
I'm not wrong, am I?

89
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:06,580
It's simple.

90
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:12,260
As long as I

91
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:15,620
drink this cup of milk,

92
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:19,420
it will come true.

93
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:42,420
This is what I found in your bag.

94
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:48,580
Don't tell me this is white sugar.

95
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:17,460
Yun'er,

96
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:18,460
turn your head a little.

97
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:22,140
Looks great.

98
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:25,860
Even has a beauty filter.

99
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:26,860
Really beautiful.

100
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:45,300
You have no right
to decide when it ends.

101
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:49,460
If it's going to end,

102
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:54,140
it will end in my hands.

103
00:06:58,500 --> 00:06:59,500
Drink it.

104
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:10,180
This is your punishment.

105
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:32,540
Ai Lian,

106
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:36,700
I've only loved you in my whole life.

107
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:42,340
If you die,

108
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:47,540
I...

109
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:54,140
I...

110
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:48,740
You taught me

111
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:53,540
don't put all the eggs in one basket.

112
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:56,580
Did you

113
00:08:58,500 --> 00:08:59,500
ever

114
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:02,820
love me?

115
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:13,300
People like us

116
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:16,460
don't deserve to talk about love.

117
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:19,460
You're right.

118
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:23,580
People like us

119
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:27,260
don't

120
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:31,820
deserve it.

121
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:12,260
What's wrong?

122
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:13,980
Nothing.

123
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:15,460
I think I saw my mom.

124
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:46,500
(Yun'er)

125
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:49,860
Mom.

126
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:52,300
Mom, are you inside?

127
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:55,660
Mom.

128
00:10:57,180 --> 00:10:58,180
Mom.

129
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:00,020
Mom, are you inside?

130
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:02,740
Mom.

131
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:05,100
Mom, are you inside?

132
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:08,820
Mom.

133
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:12,780
- Mom.
- Yun'er.

134
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:14,420
- Ai Lian.
- Captain Ye.

135
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:15,420
Officer An.

136
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:16,780
What are you doing here?

137
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:17,780
We were just passing by.

138
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:20,340
Tata and the others went out to play,

139
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:21,260
and brought me along.

140
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:22,260
Mom, why are you here?

141
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:23,890
This is my friend's home.

142
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:24,740
Came to check it out.

143
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:27,380
Don't stand outside.

144
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:29,180
Come in for some water, and we can chat

145
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:30,180
or eat something.

146
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:32,200
Thank you for taking
such good care of Yun'er.

147
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:33,900
Come in, come in.

148
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:34,940
No, no need.

149
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:37,000
It's getting late,
we should head down the mountain.

150
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:40,900
Yun'er, are you staying with your mom

151
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:42,340
or coming with us?

152
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:43,700
You guys go ahead, Tata.

153
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:45,260
I'll stay and keep my mom company.

154
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:49,020
Alright, we'll go first.

155
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:50,820
Okay, take it easy on the way.

156
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:51,980
- Alright, alright.
- Bye.

157
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:52,820
Bye.

158
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:53,940
Alright, see you.

159
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:55,540
- Text me when you arrive.
- Okay.

160
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:57,300
- Bye, Tata.
- Bye.

161
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:07,220
Bye.

162
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:20,300
Mom, it's so good to see you here.

163
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:23,380
Mom, why are your hands so cold?

164
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:24,380
Are you cold?

165
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:26,980
Let's go inside.

166
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:28,820
It's cold outside.

167
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:29,700
Mom.

168
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:31,980
Whose house is this?

169
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:33,340
Why have I never been here before?

170
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:39,260
Yun'er.

171
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:40,820
Mom.

172
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:42,100
Who is he?

173
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:43,980
Why is he lying there?

174
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:47,780
He's a friend of mine.

175
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:50,420
A friend of yours?

176
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:54,180
Yun'er.

177
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:55,300
Let's go home.

178
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:56,520
We'll come back another day.

179
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:05,540
Yun'er.

180
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:10,500
Don't shout.

181
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:17,380
Mom.

182
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:18,980
What happened to him?

183
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:22,260
Don't lie to me.

184
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:23,620
What happened?

185
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:28,980
It was me.

186
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:31,500
I killed him.

187
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:36,780
Yun'er.

188
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:38,180
Don't be afraid.

189
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:41,900
Don't be afraid. Don't worry.

190
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:43,820
Don't ask anything right now.

191
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:46,180
I will explain it to you later.

192
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:47,980
Don't be afraid.

193
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:56,140
I need to think of a way

194
00:13:57,820 --> 00:13:58,820
to get rid of him.

195
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:26,060
Yun'er.

196
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:27,180
Go away.

197
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:28,420
Mom.

198
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,720
You can't move him by yourself.

199
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:36,620
Ai Lian said that,

200
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:38,020
selling out this batch of goods,

201
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:39,020
they won't supply anymore.

202
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:40,020
(Interrogation Room)

203
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:41,060
But not long after,

204
00:14:41,070 --> 00:14:42,020
she contacted me again

205
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:43,580
and told me they had enough supply.

206
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:46,260
I knew they must have a place
for making drugs.

207
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:48,080
Where is the production site?

208
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:49,580
How could I know?

209
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:55,820
I know

210
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:57,100
Ai Lian goes to a place

211
00:14:57,110 --> 00:14:58,060
every so often.

212
00:14:58,300 --> 00:14:59,390
I followed her once.

213
00:14:59,830 --> 00:15:01,520
She drove all the way
to Feiyun Mountain.

214
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:02,940
But she was very cautious.

215
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,820
When the car reached
halfway of the mountain,

216
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:06,300
it stopped for over an hour.

217
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:07,740
I thought,

218
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:08,820
she must have noticed me.

219
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:10,260
What happened next?

220
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:12,580
I feared her revenge.

221
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:13,660
So I stopped following her.

222
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:15,460
Where is that place exactly?

223
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:17,740
It's near Fengwu Village.

224
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:19,580
Fengwu Village?

225
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:21,380
Director Zhou.

226
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:23,460
There is probably
a drug manufacturing den

227
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:24,590
in Fengwu Village, Feiyun Mountain.

228
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:25,860
We are leaving immediately.

229
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:27,500
I request police support.

230
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:29,780
Yes.

231
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:46,140
Captain.

232
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:48,540
I feel like something's not right.

233
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:49,680
What's wrong?

234
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,260
Yun'er said her mom
was on a business.

235
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:53,380
How could she be at Feiyun Mountain?

236
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:03,460
Director Zhou.

237
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:04,980
Are you still at Fengwu Village?

238
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:07,940
We're heading down the mountain.

239
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:09,100
Don't leave.

240
00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:10,980
Huaiyang suspects

241
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:12,340
there's a drug manufacturing den.

242
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:14,480
They are on their way up the mountain.

243
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:15,660
You can join forces

244
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:16,860
with the Anti-narcotics Brigade.

245
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:18,260
The break is over.

246
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:19,380
Vehicles and equipment

247
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:21,580
are already on their way.

248
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:23,900
Yes, Hummer Commandos is on it.

249
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:26,420
Tang Xin, turn around.

250
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:27,620
Yes.

251
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:37,940
(Ai Lian, suspected of
drug manufacturing and trafficking)

252
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:45,100
Captain.

253
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:46,100
What happened?

254
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:47,820
Chen Yun'er's mother

255
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:49,010
is under drug investigation.

256
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,460
We need to assist in the arrest.

257
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:53,240
Fengwu Village may also have
a drug manufacturing den.

258
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:58,040
Let's go back to where
we dropped off Chen Yun'er.

259
00:16:58,960 --> 00:16:59,830
Yes.

260
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:00,940
Get ready for action.

261
00:17:00,950 --> 00:17:01,820
- Yes.
- Yes.

262
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:02,820
Yes.

263
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:15,100
Yun'er.

264
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:53,660
I knew

265
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:56,900
this day was bound to come.

266
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:02,020
What I fear the most

267
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:06,380
is this day.

268
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:10,300
I even wake up from my dreams.

269
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:18,180
It must be God

270
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:20,180
punishing me.

271
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:30,900
Yun'er.

272
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:33,620
What I fear the most

273
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:35,260
is you seeing all of this.

274
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:41,220
I'm not a good person.

275
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:20,500
I opened the beauty salon,

276
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:22,820
but it's just a cover.

277
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,540
It was just to make it easier for him

278
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:28,780
to traffic drugs.

279
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:34,100
I've done too many bad things.

280
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:38,180
I'm beyond saving.

281
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:52,940
But Yun'er,

282
00:19:58,660 --> 00:19:59,860
I really want to

283
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:01,380
give you a clean life.

284
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:05,300
I wanted to take you abroad

285
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:06,780
to get away from all of this.

286
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:11,060
But he,

287
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:12,580
he has been

288
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:13,580
pressuring me these days.

289
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:15,460
He won't let us leave.

290
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:18,980
He even threatened me with your safety.

291
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:21,140
So I killed him.

292
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:26,860
I couldn't let him destroy you too.

293
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:38,060
I had to do this.

294
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:43,060
I could only do this.

295
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:49,540
Yun'er,

296
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:51,260
this is the path I chose.

297
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:53,580
I don't have the right to regret.

298
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:57,420
I'm just worried about you.

299
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:07,980
No.

300
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:09,740
I have to send you away.

301
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:21,300
Get in the car.

302
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:14,780
It's Ai Lian.

303
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:18,180
Captain, what should we do?

304
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:19,980
It's fine, she won't escape.

305
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:20,980
Roadblocks everywhere.

306
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:22,500
What's the situation?

307
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:23,700
We've already located Ai Lian.

308
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:25,300
On our way.

309
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:33,900
Go.

310
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:35,180
Leave Binjiang.

311
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:40,940
That's what I was thinking.

312
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:43,060
Leave Binjiang.

313
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:46,060
No one will ever know

314
00:22:46,070 --> 00:22:47,380
what I've done.

315
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:50,540
But now,

316
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:52,460
it's too late.

317
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:54,940
You've known

318
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:56,860
and you've been dragged into this.

319
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:02,460
How could I let you

320
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:05,460
bear my sins?

321
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:11,300
I can't watch my daughter

322
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:13,580
worrying for me.

323
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:17,780
I can't let that happen.

324
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:20,500
Absolutely not.

325
00:23:42,390 --> 00:23:43,270
Report, report.

326
00:23:43,270 --> 00:23:44,860
(Command Center)
Suspicious vehicle pivoted

327
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:46,100
at village entrance, headed uphill.

328
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:47,100
It turned east.

329
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:49,900
Captain Ye.

330
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:51,500
The suspicious vehicle is heading east.

331
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:52,660
Alright, we got it.

332
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:54,300
Let's drive east.

333
00:23:54,420 --> 00:23:55,420
Yes.

334
00:23:57,700 --> 00:23:58,780
Yun'er.

335
00:23:58,780 --> 00:23:59,780
Listen to me.

336
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:02,060
This happened too suddenly.

337
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:04,340
I don't have any other plans now.

338
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:05,900
I just want to send you away.

339
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:10,420
Tomorrow...

340
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:13,900
Tomorrow I'll turn myself in.

341
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:16,220
You are innocent.

342
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:17,220
You don't need to worry.

343
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:18,980
In the future,

344
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:20,680
cut off all contact with me.

345
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:23,660
Change your name

346
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:25,580
and start a new life.

347
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:28,420
Yes.

348
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:30,100
Just like that.

349
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:34,380
Yun'er.

350
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:35,700
Did you hear me?

351
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:36,980
Did you hear

352
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:37,980
what I just said to you?

353
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:39,420
Yun'er.

354
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:40,660
Did you hear me?

355
00:24:58,860 --> 00:24:59,860
So fast.

356
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:25,660
(Yun'er)

357
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:29,180
(Tata)

358
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:45,580
(Tata)

359
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:09,020
(Tata)

360
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:23,620
Captain.

361
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:25,700
Do you think Yun'er knows

362
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:27,140
about what Ai Lian did?

363
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:28,660
If she didn't know,

364
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:30,160
she wouldn't be acting like this now.

365
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:36,300
Tata.

366
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:37,300
You must remember,

367
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:38,820
you are a police officer.

368
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:41,020
You can't be swayed
by personal emotions.

369
00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:45,780
Understood.

370
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:05,900
Captain.

371
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:07,540
This is in the direction
of the second floor.

372
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:08,540
We'll be there soon.

373
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:12,020
What do they want?

374
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:14,460
They probably know they can't escape,

375
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:15,880
so they're trying to stall for time.

376
00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:42,220
- Hello.
- Captain Ye.

377
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:43,180
The needed equipment

378
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:44,260
arrived at the assigned site.

379
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:46,540
We'll join Anti-narcotics Brigade
to arrest drug dealers.

380
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:47,620
We won't wait for you.

381
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:49,180
Alright, thank you.

382
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:53,620
Mom.

383
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:55,900
Mom.

384
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:57,340
Mom.

385
00:27:57,540 --> 00:27:59,260
If the police catch you,

386
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:00,260
will you die?

387
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:05,140
If I die, I die.

388
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:06,980
You can't get involved.

389
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:08,780
But I've already been dragged into this.

390
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:22,300
(Hummer Commandos)

391
00:29:09,820 --> 00:29:16,300
(Police)

392
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:28,620
What is this?

393
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:30,900
A bomb.

394
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:34,660
In this situation,

395
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:36,060
we can only escape.

396
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:38,940
Take the secret passage.

397
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:40,140
If the police catch up,

398
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:41,300
we have a bomb.

399
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:42,500
That gives us a chance.

400
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:44,500
How long to exit
through the secret passage?

401
00:29:44,540 --> 00:29:45,580
At most half an hour.

402
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:52,180
(Surveillance)

403
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:00,980
It's too late.

404
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:03,020
Yun'er, Yun'er.

405
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:05,540
What are you doing?

406
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:07,220
Mom, you go first.

407
00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:08,300
I'll buy some time.

408
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:09,260
No way.

409
00:30:09,260 --> 00:30:10,260
We either go together,

410
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:11,580
or I'll turn myself in.

411
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:13,900
Mom.

412
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:15,140
You either leave now,

413
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:16,900
or

414
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:18,700
I'll detonate the bomb.

415
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:20,300
We'll die together.

416
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:25,340
(Sniffer Dog)

417
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:29,500
Open the car.

418
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:44,380
How's inside?

419
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:45,380
Captain Zhu, we checked.

420
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:46,380
They're not inside.

421
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:47,380
There's no back door.

422
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:49,380
I think there should be a secret door.

423
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:51,200
Otherwise, they wouldn't
disappear like this.

424
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:56,380
Do you think
the drug manufacturing den is here?

425
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:57,860
Even if it's not here,

426
00:30:57,860 --> 00:30:59,180
we still have to check everywhere.

427
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:00,380
Dajun,

428
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:01,660
take the sniffer dog to recheck.

429
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:02,940
Yes, Captain Zhu. Let's go.

430
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:05,020
Oh, by the way,

431
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:07,420
we saw two servings of breakfast
on the table earlier.

432
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:08,940
But Chen Yun'er

433
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:10,140
had breakfast with us.

434
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:11,860
So that means

435
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:13,660
- there was a third person.
- Yes.

436
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:14,620
Captain.

437
00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:15,620
We found something.

438
00:31:17,780 --> 00:31:19,700
There's a man's clothing under the bed.

439
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:26,900
It should be Wu's.

440
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:29,660
Wu?

441
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:30,660
Yes.

442
00:31:31,060 --> 00:31:32,060
Wu's real name

443
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:33,340
is Gao Jianwu.

444
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:35,060
We've been investigating him.

445
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:37,340
After finding
Ai Lian was a drug trafficker,

446
00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:40,140
all the details matched.

447
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:42,300
You mean

448
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:43,300
they know each other?

449
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:45,500
Yes, they used to date.

450
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:47,300
Later, Wu went out to work,

451
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:48,230
and never came back.

452
00:31:48,230 --> 00:31:49,820
Ai Lian married Chen Yuanhang then.

453
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:52,140
Life was always tough for her.

454
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:53,220
But after the divorce,

455
00:31:54,060 --> 00:31:55,890
she received a large sum of money

456
00:31:55,910 --> 00:31:57,240
and opened a beauty salon.

457
00:31:58,100 --> 00:31:59,100
The drugs she sold

458
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:00,980
were Wu's.

459
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:03,140
There are two bombs here.

460
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:05,620
One is real,

461
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:07,860
and one is fake.

462
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:10,820
Do you know which one is real?

463
00:32:17,660 --> 00:32:18,940
We're running out of time, Mom.

464
00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:20,300
Just put one on me.

465
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:21,300
Hurry and leave.

466
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:26,340
Hurry, Mom, there's really no time left.

467
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:29,620
Mom, hurry up.

468
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:30,740
They're coming.

469
00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:35,620
Captain Zhu,
the sniffer dog didn't react.

470
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:37,660
This shouldn't be the drug den
we're looking for.

471
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:38,980
Alright.

472
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:40,860
This is on you. Let's go.

473
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:41,860
Okay.

474
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:19,300
Captain, there's a situation.

475
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:26,820
(Policewoman's Mini-Class)

476
00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:30,900
(Methamphetamine)

477
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:32,740
One year.

(3 grams)

479
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:40,740
Seven years.

480
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:47,780
(10 grams)

481
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:50,020
15 years.

482
00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:57,020
(50 grams)

483
00:33:59,420 --> 00:34:00,420
Life sentence.

484
00:34:00,420 --> 00:34:07,420
(100 grams)

485
00:34:09,860 --> 00:34:11,080
