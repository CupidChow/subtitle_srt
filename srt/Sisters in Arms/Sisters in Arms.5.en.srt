You guys continue.

26
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:31,560
- Eat more if you like it.
- Thanks, Mom.

27
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,000
I will make you fresh ones tomorrow.

Tomorrow we'll stuff sausages.

You eat too.

31
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,200
I'm full.

32
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:56,360
Dad.

33
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,280
Mom.

34
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,480
Sorry.

35
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:03,960
I have to go.

36
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,240
The reason I came back this time

37
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,840
was to tell you

38
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,960
that I'm very happy

39
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,360
to be your son.

40
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,600
If you're so happy, why leave?

41
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,520
Mingzhe.

42
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,760
Please don't go.

43
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:24,680
Okay?

44
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:32,320
Mom.

45
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:33,720
I have something to do.

46
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:34,840
I have to leave.

47
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:36,760
You can do it here too.

48
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,240
When I was little,

49
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,720
you always told me

50
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:47,120
to be responsible when I grow up.

51
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,520
I've grown up now.

52
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:52,400
I have to face my life on my own.

53
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,080
Take care of yourself.

54
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,560
Don't worry about me.

55
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,520
Mingzhe.

56
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:00,680
Mingzhe.

57
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:12,480
Lin, how much do you think you scored?

58
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,520
About 640.

59
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,800
Wow, you'll definitely
get into a top college.

60
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:40,640
Son.

61
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,240
I'm just passing by.

62
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,280
Please stop following me.

63
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,840
I've finally found a place to stay.

64
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,120
If you find out,

65
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,120
I'll have to move again.

66
00:05:58,640 --> 00:05:59,600
Please let me be.

67
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,480
No more bothering.

68
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,440
Come home with me.

69
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:03,440
You can start over.

70
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,080
Okay?

71
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,440
I've tried.

72
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,280
I can't go back.

73
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,680
If I do,

74
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,640
I'll be a burden to you.

75
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:23,880
How could you be a burden, kid?

76
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,560
Go home with Dad. I'll take care of you.

77
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:26,760
Is that okay?

78
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:28,640
Sorry, Dad.

79
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:32,040
I've let you down.

80
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:34,560
Mingzhe.

81
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:37,000
Son.

82
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,040
Let's go home together.

83
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,000
Mom's waiting for you at home.

84
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,640
She made so much good food for you.

85
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:43,000
You don't know how happy I am

86
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,760
to see you after these days.

87
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,040
Son.

88
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,400
Tell me the truth.

89
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,240
This time you came back,

90
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,320
nothing bad will happen, right?

91
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,440
Kid.

92
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:03,880
Say something.

93
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:11,160
Why do you have so many gray hairs?

94
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,600
You didn't have them when I left.

95
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,200
It's fine, kid.

96
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:17,360
Let's go home.

97
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,160
Come on, go home with Dad.

98
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:21,000
Let's go home, come on.

99
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,160
Dad.

100
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,240
Take care of yourself.

101
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,200
Don't treat yourself badly anymore.

102
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:34,000
Just consider I'm no longer your son.

103
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:35,320
What?

104
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:37,320
If there's another chance in the next life,

105
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,000
I'll be your son again.

106
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,400
Nonsense.

107
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,120
Mingzhe.

108
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,120
Mingzhe, come back.

109
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:12,760
Mingzhe!

110
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,760
Chen, how's it going on your side?

111
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:02,640
Captain Zhu.

112
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,800
The man went into a restaurant with a woman.

113
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,520
Looks fine for now.

114
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:07,680
What about Dajun?

115
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,160
Captain.

116
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,560
Nothing wrong with the milk tea.

117
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:12,680
Come back.

118
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:13,600
It's probably not.

119
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:14,840
Yes.

120
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,360
What are you doing?

121
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,310
Are you going to hit me?

122
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:27,870
I...

123
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:32,020
(Shilixiang BBQ)
At ease.

124
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:34,760
Turn right.

125
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,240
Hello, everyone.

126
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,720
We are the Hummer Commandos

127
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:42,960
from the patrol special police team.

128
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:43,920
Today we are here

129
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,440
mainly to remind everyone

130
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,720
to drink alcohol in moderation.

131
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:48,000
It's strictly prohibited to

132
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
cause trouble or fight after drinking.

133
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:51,920
If you witness such behavior,

134
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,160
please call 110 immediately.

135
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:55,040
We will rush to the scene right away.

136
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:56,800
We'll take our leave.

137
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,440
Enjoy your meal, drinks and good times.

138
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:00,960
Salute.

139
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,000
Good.

140
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:03,600
At ease.

141
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,240
Turn left.

142
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:06,800
March.

143
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:17,880
Stop.

144
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,400
Stop!

145
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,160
Stop!

146
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:28,840
Officer.

147
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,480
Officer, why are you arresting me?

148
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,360
I haven't stolen anything recently.

149
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:33,520
Then why were you running?

150
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:35,320
I...

151
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,160
Officer.

152
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:38,400
Take him back.

153
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:09,640
Captain Zhu.

154
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,960
Something's off here.

155
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:13,360
Stay alert.

156
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:35,480
Looks like

157
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,200
the delivery guy is in trouble.

158
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,160
- What are you doing?
- Keep running.

159
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:00,240
Try running again.

160
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,120
I thought you ran abroad.

161
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,720
Is it really necessary, bro?

162
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:04,960
It's just a few thousand bucks,

163
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,360
and you're throwing away your friends?

164
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,680
Don't you feel shame?

165
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,000
You got the wrong person.

166
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:10,920
I got the wrong person? Let me tell you.

167
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,400
I know you even if you peel your skin off.

168
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:13,360
You think I wouldn't

169
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,740
recognize you when you wear a mask?

170
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:17,480
Look.

171
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:18,480
Do you recognize me?

172
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,860
Am I the person you're looking for?

173
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,600
I'm so sorry, my mistake.

174
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,520
This is ridiculous!

175
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:27,600
I'm so sorry.

176
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:36,040
Li Mingzhe!

177
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:40,320
Boss.

178
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:42,560
Boss.

179
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:45,440
Boss.

180
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:50,120
You dare mess with me, huh?

181
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,480
Are you out of your mind?

182
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:52,960
- I didn't.
- Are you out of your mind?

183
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,000
Are you crazy?

184
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,400
You messed with me.

185
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,400
I didn't lie to you.

186
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:00,560
You said it was lost.

187
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:01,840
You think I'm stupid?

188
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,680
I didn't lie to you.

189
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:04,760
Boss, I didn't lie to you.

190
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,520
You thought you could mess with me, huh?

191
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:08,760
Boss, if I were hiding the goods,

192
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:09,760
I would have run by now.

193
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,440
How could I tell you?

194
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:17,520
You still want to run?

195
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:20,280
Stab me in the back?

196
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,400
I'll put him six feet under!

197
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,520
You hear me?

198
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:25,160
I wouldn't hide anything.

199
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:26,600
I'm not that stupid.

200
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:27,760
Still arguing?

201
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:58,200
Boss, something's wrong.

202
00:14:58,720 --> 00:14:59,640
The goods are lost.

203
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,120
Okay.

204
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:06,480
I got it.

205
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,920
I don't care if you lost it or swallowed it.

206
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,000
By noon tomorrow,

207
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,600
I want to see the goods

208
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,280
or the money.

209
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:27,200
Sir, I don't have money.

210
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:32,200
I know you don't have money.

211
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,800
But your parents have, right?

212
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,880
No.

213
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:37,520
Don't, don't do this.

214
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:38,440
No. 55

215
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,480
in Xingfu Alley.

216
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:41,880
- Right?
- No.

217
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:44,480
Sir, I beg you, I beg you.

218
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:45,520
It has nothing to do with them.

219
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:46,360
I beg you.

220
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:47,200
Don't look for them.

221
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,120
I beg you, boss.

222
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,640
I'm helping you.

223
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:52,400
Either give me money

224
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:54,720
or shed some blood.

225
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,080
You really need to think carefully.

226
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,280
Boss, I beg you.

227
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:13,440
Think it through!

228
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:40,440
Captain Zhu.

229
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:42,400
Drink some water.

230
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:45,400
How's it going?

231
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:47,640
Hello?

232
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:52,920
Good, great.

233
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:54,240
Thank you.

234
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:55,480
Did you find it, Captain Zhu?

235
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:56,360
Does he have a criminal record?

236
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:58,480
He just got out of rehab six months ago.

237
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:00,240
His name is Zheng Xuefeng.

238
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:01,920
Stop eating, let's go.

239
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,800
- Where to?
- Find him.

240
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:13,040
Zheng Xuefeng.

241
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:16,520
What's wrong with you?

242
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:17,520
You've been following me all night.

243
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,360
I told you, I'm not the person
who owes you money.

244
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:20,880
- Why are you following me?
- Shut up.

245
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,000
I know who you are.

246
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:27,840
Police?

247
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,360
Are you serious?

248
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,360
There's a case,

249
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:31,680
needs your assist in the investigation.

250
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:32,640
Is that okay?

251
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:36,960
- Okay.
- Let's go.

252
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:37,880
Go.

253
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:44,810
- Don't move.
- It hurts.

254
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:45,800
It hurts.

255
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,240
Go.

256
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:56,880
You think I want this?

257
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:00,040
I've been tricked too.

258
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,160
I went to karaoke with a friend.

259
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:04,840
What's wrong with that?

260
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:07,080
I smoked a cigarette someone handed me.

261
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:10,100
How could I know it would turn out like this?

262
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:11,960
Why are you arresting me?

263
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:14,040
I'm a victim too.

264
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,600
Why don't you arrest those

265
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,320
who make and sell drugs!

266
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,920
I know you're a victim.

267
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:23,880
But now,

268
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:27,120
you've joined a criminal group.

269
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:29,400
You're helping them harm others.

270
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:30,640
I...

271
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:32,240
Isn't that wrong?

272
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:41,200
Let me tell you.

273
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:46,040
Your wife still hasn't remarried.

274
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,320
And you have a daughter.

275
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,560
Is this how you

276
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,720
set an example for your daughter?

277
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:57,640
Do you really plan to live

278
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:58,960
like a monster?

279
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:07,240
Drugs

280
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,360
are not just harmful to the body.

281
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:14,320
It's not that it can't be quit for life.

282
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:16,480
The most important thing
is that it makes people

283
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:18,760
lose their moral bottom line.

284
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:20,320
That is to say,

285
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:22,800
now you would do anything

286
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:24,720
you didn't dare to do before.

287
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:29,320
Think carefully.

288
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,720
Cooperate with us or not.

289
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:35,960
Do you want to punish those

290
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,280
who once hurt you?

291
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:40,480
Do you want to save

292
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:42,800
those innocent people?

293
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:46,480
Saving others is saving yourself.

294
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,600
I don't know who they are.

295
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,520
We've only communicated through chat apps.

296
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:15,400
Have you met the delivery guy?

297
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:17,280
I never had direct contact with him.

298
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:18,880
He always wore a mask.

299
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:20,980
How do you give them the money?

300
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,360
According to their instructions,

301
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:26,240
I always

302
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:28,880
put the cash in the designated place.

303
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:30,880
Like this time,

304
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,480
I put it in

305
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,910
the trash can at the intersection
of Wenhua Road.

306
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,920
You guys' plan was clever.

307
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:38,190
And knew how to miss the cameras.

308
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:40,740
You need to pay before you get the goods.

309
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:45,760
Officer.

310
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,800
I've told you everything I know.

311
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:49,520
I promise,

312
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,880
I won't contact them again.

313
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:53,240
No, no, no. You will contact them.

314
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:55,200
Of course you will.

315
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,160
You've already paid.

316
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:58,680
You need to get the goods.

317
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:00,480
I believe

318
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:03,360
they'll arrange someone to contact you.

319
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:05,440
Set the time and place

320
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:07,920
for delivery with them.

321
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,840

00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:19,760
Yes.

324
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:28,040
I know you don't have money.

325
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:30,880

328
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:36,560
Either give me money

329
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:38,800
or shed some blood.

330

00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:29,240
What's going on?

383
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:30,200
What's happening?

384
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:31,080
Is it Li Mingzhe?

385
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:32,000
Yes, it's him.

386
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:39,840
What do you want?

387
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:40,840
I warn you.

388
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:42,520
It's my wedding today. Don't cause trouble.

389
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,920
Don't be nervous, we're brothers.

390
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,920
I'm here to congratulate you.

391
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:50,160
Look at you now.

392
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:51,160
You're really different.

393
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:52,760
Looks successful.

394
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:54,800
Alright, stop spitting nonsense.

395
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:56,440
I don't have time for this today.

396
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:57,880
You want money, right?

397
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:58,840
Come on, give me your phone.

398
00:25:58,840 --> 00:25:59,760
I'll transfer money now.

399
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,120
Take the money, then leave.

400
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:03,600
I've got a big gift for you at my house.

401
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:04,840
Are you crazy?

402
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:06,400
I don't want any big gift from you.

403
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:07,440
Let me tell you.

404
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:08,320
From now on,

405
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:09,680
we have no relationship at all.

406
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,560
Stay out of my life.

407
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:20,980
(Huaniao Garden)

408
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:24,160
- Stop!
- Stop, stop!

409
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:27,380
(Happy wedding to Xu Junjie and Li Lili)

410
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:30,880
Hummer Commandos, pay attention.

411
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:33,040
A kidnapping just occurred at Huaniao Garden.

412
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:34,480
Please go there immediately.

413
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:35,400
Copy that.

414
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:41,620
(SWAT, Binjiang)

415
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:59,080
The suspect's name is Li Mingzhe.

416
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:00,880
He kidnapped his
university classmate Xu Junjie.

417
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,720
They're now heading north of the city.

418
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:04,440
The vehicle is a silver minivan.

419
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:06,720
The license plate is HAF11453.

420
00:27:07,910 --> 00:27:09,960
Wanru, do we have the exact
location of the vehicle?

421
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:12,800
We are still tracking it.

422
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:18,960
Xu Junjie is quite popular.

423
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:21,040
He was especially close with Li Mingzhe.

424
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:23,120
I haven't heard of any conflicts
between them.

425
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:26,200
Right, Xu Junjie went abroad
during his third year.

426
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:28,440
Li Mingzhe was doing well
academically before.

427
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:29,480
But we don't know why

428
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:30,400
that after Xu Junjie left,

429
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:31,720
Li Mingzhe dropped out.

430
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:33,280
Anyway, after the third year,

431
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:34,760
we hardly saw Li Mingzhe anymore.

432
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:38,360
By the way, Li Mingzhe has changed a lot now.

433
00:27:38,510 --> 00:27:40,010
I almost didn't recognize him earlier.

434
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:43,040
In my impression,

435
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:45,080
he was a bit shy

436
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:46,920
and very introverted.

437
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:48,280
Not very sociable.

438
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:51,520
Yes, he only hung out with Xu Junjie.

439
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:54,120
It seemed like he was Xu Junjie's sidekick.

440
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:55,360
That's right.

441
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:58,240
We didn't know much about the rest.

442
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:59,160
Right.

443
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:13,200
Captain Ye, we have a lead on the minivan.

444
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:14,640
It was last seen at the entrance

445
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:16,080
to the North Suburb Industrial Park.

446
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:17,600
We've already sent people to check.

447
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:19,000
Additionally, our colleagues

448
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,560
are talking to Li Mingzhe's parents.

449
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,600
OK. North Suburb Industrial Park.

450
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:23,920
Yes.

451
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,920
How could Mingzhe commit a crime?

452
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:31,800
He's been gentle since he was a child.

453
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:35,320
He wouldn't even hurt a cat or a dog.

454
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:37,640
Have you heard him talk about Xu Junjie?

455
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:41,080
No.

456
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:42,280
According to our investigation,

457
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:44,520
Xu Junjie was Li Mingzhe's only friend

458
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:45,480
in college.

459
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:46,960
Are you sure he never mentioned him?

460
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:49,680
- No.
- After he entered college,

461
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:51,760
he rarely came home.

462
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:54,360
And he rarely talked about school.

463
00:28:55,310 --> 00:28:56,270
Do you have any idea

464
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:57,900
where he might have gone?

465
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:00,840
Where does he work?

466
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,600
Where does he live?

467
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:07,440
Were they not on good terms?

468
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:09,080
Otherwise, why don't they know anything?

469
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:11,000
Do you have any problems

470
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,360
with your child?

471
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:14,400
No.

472
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:17,080
We have a good relationship as a family.

473
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:18,120
My son is outstanding.

474
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:19,800
Don't you see how urgent this is,

475
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:21,520
what else is there to hide?

476
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:23,000
Please calm down.

477
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:24,880
After entering college,

478
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,880
Mingzhe changed a lot.

479
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,680
It's all because you wanted to save face.

480
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:30,600
You hid it from me
and didn't let me manage him.

481
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:32,040
Then you bragged to others

482
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:34,160
about how great our son is.

483
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:35,440
What bragging?

484
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:37,760
Officer.

485
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:39,640
Our son Mingzhe

486
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:42,160
really never

487
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,080
caused trouble for us.

488
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:45,960
We're not educated.

489
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:48,880
People look down on us.

490
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:50,120
But our son

491
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:52,080
is outstanding.

492
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:54,000
He's the pride of the Li family.

493
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,560
I'm not wrong, am I?

494
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:59,160
I really didn't expect him to be like this.

495
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:03,200
Luo.

496
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:05,440
I want to talk to Li Mingzhe's father.

497
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:06,360
Copy that.

498
00:30:13,230 --> 00:30:14,080
It's okay.

499
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:21,480
Officer, can I answer the phone?

500
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:23,560
Go ahead.

501
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:27,400
Hello?

502
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:28,240
Hello, Mr. Li.

503
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:30,180
This is Ye Zhen,
captain of the Hummer Commandos.

504
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:31,080
Hello.

505
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:32,360
Regarding Li Mingzhe,

506
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:34,400
is there something you haven't told us?

507
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,560
How about you come to the industrial park?

508
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:42,760
Let's meet and talk.

509
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:44,960
I'll be there.

510
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:54,160
Li Mingzhe and Xu Junjie

511
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:56,120
were good friends in their first year.

512
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:57,920
But after a year,

513
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:59,400
Xu Junjie went abroad,

514
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,160
and Li Mingzhe dropped out.

515
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:03,640
If this isn't a coincidence,

516
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:05,440
what happened in between?

517
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:06,920
This might be the reason Xu Junjie

518
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:08,200
was kidnapped.

519
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:10,840
Li Mingzhe still hasn't

520
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:12,880
asked Xu Junjie's family for money.

521
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:15,280
His demand is probably not money.

522
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:17,920
Then what is his demand?

523
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:19,520
He says nothing.

524
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:21,720
Sometimes there is no demand.

525
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:22,640
Right.

526
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:24,680
Like revenge and venting anger.

527
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:25,640
I think Li Mingzhe's father

528
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:26,680
definitely knows something.

529
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:29,060
Captain Ye, we've found the van.

530
00:31:29,060 --> 00:31:30,560
It's at the entrance of Warehouse 16.

531
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:32,200
Roger.

532
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:41,020
(Policewoman's Mini-Class)

533
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:43,120
You think drugs are far from you.

534
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:44,600
Actually, they're very close.

535
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:46,040
(Policewoman's Mini-Class)

536
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:46,960
I'm so tired.

537
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:48,360
Have a puff.

538
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:49,800
Not interested.

539
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:52,280
The fruity flavored e-cigarettes
are very relieving.

540
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:54,360
Really? Let me try then.

541
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,880
This might contain synthetic cannabinoids.

542
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:59,040
It can become addictive
immediately after you smoke it.

543
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:01,520
Please keep in mind,

544
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:02,960
don't put unknown things

545
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:04,240
