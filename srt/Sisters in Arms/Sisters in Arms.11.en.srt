Yun'er's symptoms

28
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:44,400
look like electrolyte imbalance.

29
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,600
This is very dangerous.

30
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:48,040
Her will to survive and determination

31
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:48,960
will be crucial.

32
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,240
You must keep encouraging her,

33
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,560
and give her the strength to live.

34
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:53,920

Chen Yun'er.

00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,120
Wake up.

38
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:01,200
Chen Yun'er.

39
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,120
Wake up, wake up.

40
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:09,520
I've only heard your story.

41
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,080
Do you want to hear mine?

42
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,280
Is that okay?

43
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:13,440
Let's exchange stories.

44
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,600
Actually,

45
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,680
I also come from a very bad family.

46
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,280
You think your dad

47
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:26,840
was no good at all,

48
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,040
but he treated you well.

49
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,240
Right?

50
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,400
I'm different.

51
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:35,320
I grew up under the shadow
of domestic violence.

52
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:38,960
My dad drank heavily.

53
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:42,160
Every time he got drunk,

54
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:43,560
he would hit me

55
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,280
and my mom.

56
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:51,760
Feel this.

57
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:52,840
Feel this.

58
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,080
Feel here.

59
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,320
A scar.

60
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,320
Now feel here.

61
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:01,400
I had eight stitches.

62
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,400
This one.

63
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:06,880
This one's fake.

64
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,880
All thanks to him.

65
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:14,400
But at that time I was too weak,

66
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,120
I didn't have the strength to resist.

67
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,880
So I practiced my
physical strength like crazy.

68
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,840
I practiced boxing hard,

69
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:24,800
and thought that one day,

70
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,320
I would become strong enough

71
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,640
to protect my mom

72
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,320
and myself.

73
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:33,720
I remember

74
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:35,920
the first time I fought back,

75
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:37,720
I was 15.

76
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:41,080
I threw a punch

77
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:44,840
and he lost two teeth.

78
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,600
He was bleeding from his mouth.

79
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:50,440
But I was also badly hurt.

80
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,560
My right arm was broken.

81
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:56,040
That night,

82
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,040
my dad and I

83
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:58,760
lined up together

84
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,320
for the emergency room.

85
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,520
The nurse was totally stunned.

86
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,880
After that incident,

87
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,240
he toned down a lot.

88
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,480
I also want to protect my mom.

89
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:17,880
Because of me,

90
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:21,080
she endured so much hardship.

91
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,280
You're also your mom's support.

92
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,680
You rely on each other,

93
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,600
so things will only get better.

94
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,160
I want to be strong like you.

95
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:33,720
Then force yourself to be strong.

96
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:10,640
I'm ready to defuse the bomb.

97
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:12,360
Everyone, evacuate now.

98
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:13,960
How's it going?

99
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:15,600
Almost done.

100
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:16,920
Director Zhou.

101
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,320
- Captain Ye.
- Mr. Lin.

102
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,320
How's Wanru doing?

103
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,240
Captain.

104
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:22,880
Nine minutes left.

105
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,560
Should be enough time to defuse it.

106
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,120
Mr. Lin.

107
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,600
Wanru is defusing the bomb.

108
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:28,920
Roughly takes nine minutes.

109
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:32,680
Make sure the trapped civilians
stay safe.

110
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,480
Wanru.

111
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,000
I'm sorry.

112
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,040
Tang Xin.

113
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:15,840
Stay strong.

114
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,600
What are you guys doing?

115
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:23,060
(Wasabi, Time's Up)

116
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:27,360
Here it comes.

117
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,080
Come on, come on.

118
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,320
Tang Xin, you lost.

119
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:36,360
By two seconds.

120
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,920
Treat me to a big meal next weekend.

121
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:38,840
Next time, next time.

122
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,160
I'll beat you next time.

123
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,560
Wasabi eating contest.

124
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,080
What are you guys after?

125
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,680
We're not done crying that day.

126
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,160
You don't know how badly

127
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,200
they cried when they thought

128
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,120
you were going to die.

129
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,840
It's like you didn't cry at all.

130
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,360
Alright.

131
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,280
I know you love me.

132
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,120
Well, I'll take you all

133
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,600
to the movies this weekend.

134
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:02,560
You pick the film.

135
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,880
Can you make it this weekend?

136
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,200
I can get out

137
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:06,800
anytime now

138
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:08,200
as long as I want.

139
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,320
What's going on?

140
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:10,320
Did Mr. Lin let you out?

141
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,320
Right.

142
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,520
Is this for real?

143
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:14,360
I thought after this incident,

144
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,880
he'd be even more reluctant
to let you out.

145
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:19,640
That means you guys

146
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:21,800
still don't know him well.

147
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:24,760
Wanru.

148
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:27,920
I once stopped you
from becoming a police officer.

149
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:29,840
But you did it anyway.

150
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,160
I told your mom

151
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,680
we would live well.

152
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,560
If anyone

153
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:40,040
unluckily sacrifices on a mission,

154
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:42,960
the other one

155
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,520
will cover her with the Party flag.

156
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,320
Do your best.

157
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,000
You've always been excellent.

158
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:54,400
I've always

159
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:56,880
been proud of you.

160
00:08:58,680 --> 00:08:59,600
Lin.

161
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,880
You're not usually this sentimental.

162
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:05,680
Don't worry.

163
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,000
For me,

164
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:08,600
this is a piece of cake.

165
00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:10,360
Dad.

166
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,000
If I make it out alive,

167
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,680
can you promise me one thing?

168
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:17,120
Sure. What's the request?

169
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:17,960
I will promise you.

170
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:19,720
How could an improvised bomb

171
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:21,200
be hard for me?

172
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:24,400
But the chance to negotiate with my dad

173
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,320
is rare.

174
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,800
This time I grabbed it.

175
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:28,480
Well done.

176
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,760
You don't know

177
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:33,320
how touching Mr. Lin's words were.

178
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,360
It's true that Lin

179
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:41,880
rarely gives me a compliment.

180
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:43,720
It's quite hard to come by.

181
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,280
Alright, Lin.

182
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,680
You're not this sentimental usually.

183
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:08,960
Wanru.

184
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:12,000
When you applied for the police academy,

185
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,320
you said to me

186
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:15,680
those who seek fame and fortune

187
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,120
should look elsewhere;

188
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:18,920
those who fear death and danger

189
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,520
should not enter here.

190
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:25,680
Actually, I never wanted you
to become a cop,

191
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,920
because I was afraid you'd face danger.

192
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,000
Now I understand.

193
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:32,960
Our whole family

194
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,960
is in the police.

195
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:38,560
That takes courage.

196
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:40,600
In this world,

197
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:42,840
someone has to

198
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,600
punish and eliminate evil.

199
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,240
Someone has to

200
00:10:48,130 --> 00:10:49,240
carry the weight forward.

201
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:50,740
Dad.

202
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,080
Am I awesome today?

203
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,280
My daughter

204
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,160
is the best.

205
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,880
Since I'm so awesome,

206
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:01,040
I want to make a request.

207
00:11:01,450 --> 00:11:02,890
What request?

208
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:04,840
I didn't expect

209
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:05,760
now Lin is

210
00:11:05,770 --> 00:11:07,520
totally obeying my commands.

211
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,560
My status at home has finally

212
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:12,840
shifted from doormat to diva.

213
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:15,880
Awesome!

214
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:16,960
Eat one, eat one.

215
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,000
Does it taste good?

216
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,520
Liu Danyang!

217
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,090
What's up?

218
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:31,210
I'll kill you!

219
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:35,360
- What's going on?
- Are you still awake?

220
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,400
I'm in a meeting.

221
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,320
I guess

222
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,880
we'll be working all night.

223
00:11:43,290 --> 00:11:44,730
Take a nap while you can.

224
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:46,960
How's the wound? Does it still hurt?

225
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:49,560
You know what,

226
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:51,800
it did hurt a little earlier.

227
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,240
But now that you ask,

228
00:11:54,290 --> 00:11:55,280
it doesn't hurt anymore.

229
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,040
Alright, keep busy.

230
00:11:59,040 --> 00:11:59,960
I'm hanging up.

231
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,040
Get some rest early.

232
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:03,520
Bye.

233
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:10,560
Get some rest early.

234
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:11,960
Bye.

235
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,160
Be serious.

236
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,920
You can still laugh
after such a big incident?

237
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:20,440
Continue.

238
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:21,600
Three bodies were found

239
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:24,040
in total at the scene.

240
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:26,520
But due to the large blast,

241
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:28,920
it's hard to identify the victims.

242
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:32,200
However, based on clothing from one body,

243
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,120
it's likely

244
00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:36,080
to be that of the pizza shop owner,
Xiahou Xiong.

245
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:38,520
Of course,

246
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:39,640
need the technical department

247
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:40,760
yo make further comparisons.

248
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:45,920
This body is wearing a gold watch.

249
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:47,760
That's Wu.

250
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,480
I've had

251
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:51,160
Huang Longfa's subordinates

252
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:52,080
identify this photo.

253
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,360
That's Wu's gold watch.

254
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,120
Take a look.

255
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:58,920
The estimated age and
physical features in the autopsy report

256
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,720
are also similar to Wu's.

257
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,920
So, that means

258
00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:05,540
the explosion has already killed Wu.

259
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:08,720
Could it be that they had a falling out

260
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:10,000
over the spoils?

261
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,120
That doesn't deserve

262
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,280
(Delivery, Wenzi, Subordinate)
two bombs of such power.

263
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:15,260
(Xiahou Xiong, Supplier, Subordinate)
They can die together.

264
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:17,460
(Huang Longfa, Subordinate, Wu)
Greed can't explain this.

265
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,160
It's hard to say

266
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:20,960
about the first one.

267
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,320
But the second one

268
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,400
was prepared for us.

269
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,000
Dajun,

270
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:31,000
have the drugs been counted?

271
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,120
Yes.

272
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:33,320
But there isn't much.

273
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:35,680
Just some small packages.

274
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,160
That's right.

275
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,400
Wu should be

276
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,360
a cautious person.

277
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:45,240
But the strange thing is

278
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:49,160
he wore such a big gold watch

279
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:52,520
and everyone knew about it.

280
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,120
Could it be interpreted as

281
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:57,880
he wanted to tell others

282
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,280
(Wu)
whoever wears this gold watch

283
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,160
is Wu?

284
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,120
That's possible.

285
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:10,160
To mislead us into thinking he is Wu,

286
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:12,800
he found a scapegoat.

287
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:16,650
Let me make a guess.

288
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:20,360
Wu once worked under Huang Longfa.

289
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:22,670
He should've controlled

290
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,480
the drug trafficking channels

291
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,240
from domestic to abroad,

292
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:28,440
and Xiahou Xiong

293
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:31,720
works in the largest
distribution network.

294
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,600
So I guess

295
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,360
Xiahou Xiong paid

296
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:38,640
for Wu to make the purchase.

297
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:50,080
We all know about the rest.

298
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,400
Wu's subordinate

299
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:52,880
was caught by us.

300
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:55,720
His identity was exposed.

301
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:56,920
The remaining

302
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,560
is the big shipment that just arrived.

303
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:01,960
He wanted to preserve his strength.

304
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,120
That would need money

305
00:15:03,330 --> 00:15:04,640
and a new identity.

306
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,880
But with such a large shipment,

307
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,680
it was enough to make him take risks,

308
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,000
making Xiahou Xiong

309
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:13,400
his target.

310
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:24,960
Few people have seen

311
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:26,800
Wu's real face.

312
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,640
But lots of people know

313
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:31,080
about this gold watch.

314
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:33,320
So it's completely possible

315
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:36,000
that he found someone
with a similar build

316
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,080
and gave him the watch.

317
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:38,880
Once it explodes,

318
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:39,840
it's a perfect

319
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:41,160
escape for him.

320
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:52,800
Once Xiahou Xiong dies,

321
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:54,490
Wu

322
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:56,520
will obtain

323
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:57,380
both money and goods.

324
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,680
If everyone thinks he's dead,

325
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:01,920
it not only

326
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,000
allows him to escape

327
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:04,880
the police pursuit

328
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:07,360
and also avoid

329
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,980
the demands and attempts to kill him

330
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:10,980
within the crime organization.

331
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,760
That's like killing four birds

332
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,720
with one stone.

333
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:16,910
If that's the case,

334
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:19,000
the two bombs

335
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,680
attracted most of
the police forces in the city.

336
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:24,600
They might have used the time
to escape Binjiang.

337
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,040
Of course,

338
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:29,440
this is just my guess.

339
00:16:30,050 --> 00:16:30,990
So,

340
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,400
we need to find concrete evidence

341
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:35,160
to confirm whether

342
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:37,680
he is dead or alive.

343
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,160
It might be a bit hot.

344
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:53,880
I'll add some cold water.

345
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:57,760
I really can't drink this milk powder.

346
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:00,680
Just one more sip.

347
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:02,520
Just one sip, just one sip.

348
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:12,240
Alright.

349
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:13,600
Let's go.

350
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:15,880
Water.

351
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:18,320
Dry tissue.

352
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:19,760
Wet tissue.

353
00:17:20,050 --> 00:17:21,450
Okay, let's go.

354
00:17:21,970 --> 00:17:22,840
Okay.

355
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:23,800
Take it slow.

356
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:26,120
We're taking Xing to the checkup.

357
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:33,570
Hello, what's wrong?

358
00:17:33,570 --> 00:17:34,460
Captain Zhu.

359
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:35,680
We've found their drug den.

360
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:37,400
Where are you?

361
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:38,600
I'll send you the location.

362
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:41,440
Okay, I'll be there right away.

363
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:46,280
How about this,

364
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,240
let's go tomorrow.

365
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,800
We've already arranged it.

366
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:52,040
But something suddenly came up.

367
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:53,600
It's okay, I'll go by myself.

368
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,480
Go by yourself? Can you handle it?

369
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:56,440
Of course I can.

370
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:57,680
I'll drive myself there.

371
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:58,840
It's fine.

372
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:00,200
Then take care.

373
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,480
Don't worry.

374
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,520
Listen to your mom.

375
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,080
- I'm leaving.
- Okay.

376
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,180
Be careful.

377
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,200
Xing, see?

378
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,320
Your daddy is super busy.

379
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:14,600
Alright.

380
00:18:14,770 --> 00:18:15,960
I'm taking you to the checkup.

381
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:21,820
(Lakeview Garden)

382
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:37,560
Zhu Huaiyang isn't in the car, hurry.

383
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:22,500
(Reminder, Xing's birthday)

384
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:40,460

Professor Dong.

387
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:56,640
Is it because of my last surgery

388
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,360
that caused damage to my body?

389
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:00,160
That's why I can't get pregnant again?

390
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:02,840
Based on your checkup report,

391
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:04,280
your body's functions

392
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:06,360
actually seem quite good.

393
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:07,880
Psychological factors

394
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:09,120
also affect pregnancy.

395
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:12,040
Have you been putting
too much pressure on yourself?

396
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:23,620
(April 22nd)

397
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,440
Do you know what I saw today?

398
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:57,080
I saw our manager hugging Li Na.

399
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,320
What kind of hug?

400
00:20:58,790 --> 00:20:59,640
Like...

401
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,120
Like this.

402
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:02,680
They were like this.

403
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:03,680
Heads close together,

404
00:21:03,690 --> 00:21:04,560
whispering something.

405
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:06,200
You wouldn't believe how sweet it was.

406
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,240
It was so brazen of them

407
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:08,680
to hug in broad daylight.

408
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:14,120
Do you think Li Na's baby could be...

409
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:16,600
Right.

410
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:17,640
Li Na's so beautiful.

411
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:18,680
And she's an accountant.

412
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:20,640
Luo is just a mechanic.

413
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,320
What good life with him?

414
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:23,760
Besides,

415
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:24,760
our manager

416
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:26,080
takes care of them so much.

417
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,720
There must be a reason.

418
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:30,000
Luo Zhongliang is such an honest man.

419
00:21:30,190 --> 00:21:32,220
He's been cheated on
and still thanks the manager.

Eat, eat.

424
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,120
You need more nutrition now.

425
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:50,400
I don't like meat.

426
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:51,720
You eat a bit more.

427
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:53,120
Okay, I'll eat.

428
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,680
You're showing off again
in front of us single folks.

429
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:59,000
You're jealous?

430
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,440
Go find someone then.

431
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:01,760
It's easy to find someone.

432
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,560
But it's hard to find someone

433
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:04,480
as close as they are.

434
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:12,880
I saw our manager hugging Li Na.

435
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,760
Do you think Li Na's baby could be...

Zhongliang.

437
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:25,080
What's wrong?

438
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:27,640
Nothing, Nana.

439
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:29,700
Did you forget to take your medicine?

440
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:31,520
I'll go get it from the car.

450
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:35,800
How did the car window break suddenly?

451
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:38,760
It already had a crack.

452
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:41,280
I thought I'd need to replace it soon.

453
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:42,800
Never expect today would be this bad.

454
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,560

Thanks, Manager.

457

Are you alright?

458
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:50,920
If not, we should go to the hospital.

459
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:54,160
It's okay. Didn't break the bones.

460

to happen to the baby.

I can't.

530
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:12,880
Zhongliang, I'm not having it.

531
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:14,240
Okay, let's not have it.

532
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:15,280
Doctor, we're done.

533
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:16,120
We're done.

534
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:18,240
You need to encourage her now.

and kid are at risk.

Whether the baby lives

538
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:24,200

It's okay.

553

555
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:36,320

00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:37,800
take good care of

557
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:39,640

- She's in hemorrhagic shock.

583
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:41,560
- Sir.
- Hello, I'm here to pick up a cake.

584
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:43,960
May I have your name?
I'll check for you.

585
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:44,960
It was ordered by Ms. Ye.

586
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:45,880
Ms. Ye.

587
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:47,840
Please wait a moment.

588
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:48,800
It's being packed.

589
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:49,760
Alright, thanks.

590
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,440
The kid is turning three, right?

591
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:57,880
Candles are inside.

592
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:00,280
Are six plates enough?

593
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:06,040
Here, take an extra pack.

594
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:08,880
Happy birthday to your child.

595
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:12,440
Sir...

596
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:13,360
Thank you.

(Neonatal Intensive Care Unit)

599
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:26,160
He's so small.

600
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:27,080
So cute.

601
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:28,840
I really want to hold him.

602
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:30,360
Do you dare?

603
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:32,360
I held a newborn once.

604
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:33,840
It was so soft,

605
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:35,200
so tiny.

606
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:37,160
Very adorable.

607
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:40,960
What do you all think?

608
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:43,210
Does he look like his dad or mom?

609
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:46,240
See that?

610
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:48,320
Lying there on the pillow.

611
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:50,840
His little feet will kick in the air.

612
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:55,000
- Xing will live here from now on?
- Yes.

613
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,160
All of this is for him.

614
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:58,880
Maybe

615
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:01,000
we should keep him in our room.

616
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,120
I'm afraid he'll get scared.

617
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:03,240
With our jobs?

618
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:04,800
How can our child get scared?

619
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:06,980

Hello.
