Zhongliang.

00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:55,600
Turn yourself in.

00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,120
What did you say?

29
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:09,560
Turn yourself in.

30
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,480
Are you trying to get me to prison

31
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,240
so you'll never see me again, right?

32
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:19,560
No, Zhongliang.

33
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:20,760
I... I won't.

34
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,000
You're the baby's father.

35
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,680
- Action.
- You're lying.

36
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:26,880
Now even you want
to abandon me, don't you?

37
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,120
No.

38
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,440
Give me the child.

39
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,720
Give me the child!

40
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,160
Give me the child.

41
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,640
- Luo Zhongliang!
- Chase him.

42
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:45,920
Luo Zhongliang!

43
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,160
Luo Zhongliang, stop!

44
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,440
- Where are you going?
- Don't come near me.

45
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,520
Give the child back to me.

46
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:52,360
- Where are you going?
- Don't come near me.

47
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,560
Luo Zhongliang, calm down.

48
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:54,480
I can't live without the child.

49
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,720
Calm down.

50
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:57,040
Calm down.

51
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,040
Nana.

52
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,560
- My child.
- Nana.

53
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:00,640
My child.

54
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,520
- Calm down.
- You all lie to me.

55
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:05,190
You're all lying to me!

56
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,640
My child!

57
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:12,560
He went inside.

58
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:24,920
Don't come over.

59
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,120
Luo Zhongliang.

60
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,040
(Police)
Let's have a talk.

61
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:31,680
Look, we're old acquaintances.

62
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,640
I watched him be born.

63
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:34,560
Remember?

64
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:41,920
Captain Ye.

65
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:43,960
You're a good person.

66
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,320
So are you.

67
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,600
You just got your wires crossed.

68
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,200
You don't understand.

69
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,160
None of you understand.

70
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,080
I do.

71
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,920
You've lived a wandering life,

72
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,440
and that makes you feel very insecure.

73
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:02,920
You felt very lonely.

74
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,720
But you never hurt others.

75
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,040
Your biggest demand

76
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:10,680
is to have a safe and warm home.

77
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:12,880
Am I right?

78
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:20,480
I know

79
00:04:21,550 --> 00:04:23,280
how important this home is to you.

80
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,760
And I believe in your selfless love for baby.

81
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:31,560
Look, it's too windy
up here on the rooftop.

82
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,200
The baby is too young to bear it.

83
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,840
Let's go downstairs and talk.

84
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,240
If

85
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,160
I can never have it,

86
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,400
my life might just be like this.

87
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,400
But now that I finally got it,

88
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,560
I'm still about to lose it.

89
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,480
I really wish

90
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,000
I had never had any of this.

91
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:05,840
My dream is to have a complete family.

92
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,560
I absolutely can't lose it.

93
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,200
Today,

94
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
right here

95
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:22,320
is the best place

96
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:25,400
for our family to find peace.

97
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,640
I know what you're going to do,

98
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:29,680
Luo Zhongliang.

99
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:31,600
You can choose to stay and watch

100
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,040
your child grow up day by day.

101
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,000
You can give him love,

102
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,440
warmth, and joy.

103
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:39,480
You'll be a great father.

104
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:41,960
Just look at

105
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:43,800
how cute he is.

106
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,240
He'll have a different life.

107
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,960
He'll grow up in a warm home,

108
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:51,600
and no one will abandon him.

109
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,520
Captain Ye.

110
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:08,920
I once

111
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:12,700
abandoned my own child.

112
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:14,870
What?

113
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,080
It was me.

114
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,720
I handed him over
to the human trafficker

115
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,800
with my own hands.

116
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:27,040
Find him a good family.

117
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,000
Forget it.

118
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:32,280
I won't sell this child.

119
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:34,280
Give me the child.

120
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:35,760
I won't sell this child anymore.

121
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,400
Give me the child!

122
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,320
Give...

123
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,120
Give me the child.

124
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:50,560
Luo Zhongliang, what happened?

125
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:55,360
My child...

126
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:57,680
My child was taken away.

127
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:05,960
We'll talk about this later.

128
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:07,400
Can you

129
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:10,120
give me the child now?

130
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:12,040
Look how much he's crying.

131
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,560
I have more experience than you.

132
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,320
Can I come over?

133
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,240
Captain Ye,

134
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,080
maybe you're right.

135
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,960
He might have a different life.

136
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:28,360
(Luo Zhongliang abandoned his own child)

137
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:30,080
(and his subsequent actions)

138
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:33,320
(have violated China's Criminal Law.)

139
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,760
(He will be punished
according to the law.)

140
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:44,060
(Suspect: Luo Zhongliang)

141
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,360
Captain.

142
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,440
Captain, haven't you eaten yet?

143
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,450
I've brought you food.

144
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,480
Thanks.

145
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,520
Let's chat a bit.

146
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:56,640
Okay.

147
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,240
I was just thinking,

148
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:04,480
as a man with

149
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,880
severe depression patient,

150
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:06,960
what kind of pressure

151
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,600
could have made
Luo Zhongliang like this?

152
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:11,400
Lack of understanding, care,
and encouragement.

153
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:13,120
So he lost

154
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,280
the courage to keep going.

155
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:17,840
Yes.

156
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:20,360
People with severe depression

157
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:21,980
are usually very sensitive

158
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:22,960
and fragile.

159
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:23,920
Sometimes just a few words

160
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,640
can worsen their condition.

161
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:28,520
That's why they need
the people around them

162
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:30,120
to be tolerant of their harshness

163
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:32,040
and their excessive perfectionism,

164
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:33,240
and forgive

165
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,320
their occasional negative emotions.

166
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:38,440
So,

167
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,160
they really need

168
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,880
patience, tolerance,

169
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,320
and care.

170
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:44,880
If Li Na

171
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,840
had been a bit more caring
and tolerant towards him,

172
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:49,960
he wouldn't have ended up like that.

173
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,240
Yeah,

174
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:58,680
it's easier said than done.

175
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:09,180
(Emergency Response Training Base)

176
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:20,960
Begin.

177
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,060
- Dodge.
- Stop it.

178
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:51,640
Captain Ye,

179
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:53,240
do we need to hold back the members

180
00:11:53,410 --> 00:11:54,350
of Raptor Commandos?

181
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:56,840
Who are you looking down on?

182
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:11,840
Get out of the way!

183
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:35,780
(How Can a Man Speak
to Make a Woman Listen)

184
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:43,160
Didn't I ask you to look for information?

185
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:44,240
What are you doing here?

186
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:45,320
I did.

187
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:47,360
Captain Zhu,

188
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,360
I've noticed

189
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:50,520
something off about you lately.

190
00:12:50,890 --> 00:12:52,200
Don't talk nonsense.

191
00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:53,240
Just do your job.

192
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:56,760
What book are you reading?

193
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:57,680
Li Baojun!

194
00:12:59,050 --> 00:12:59,960
Attention!

195
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:00,960
Yes.

196
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:01,920
What do you want to say?

197
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:02,840
If nothing, get lost.

198
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:03,840
There's something.

199
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,240
What is it?

200
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,640
Today, someone reported drug use.

201
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:09,440
When Chen and I arrived at the scene,

202
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,040
we found the person
frothing at the mouth

203
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:11,880
and convulsing all over.

204
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:13,000
Luckily he got
to the hospital in time,

205
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
so nothing serious happened.

206
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:14,960
Where's he now?

207
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,160
Chen is interrogating him now.

208
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,840
Why didn't you say that earlier?

209
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:23,780
(How Can a Man Speak
to Make a Woman Listen)

210
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,520
Mad Dog.

211
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,560
How's it going?

212
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,840
I didn't call you. Why are you here?

213
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:36,720
What's wrong?

214
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:38,720
Can't I just come to check things out?

215
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:40,280
But you

216
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:41,940
didn't answer my call.

217
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:43,600
I thought something had happened to you.

218
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,240
I need to focus on my work, okay?

219
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,020
You've got principles.

220
00:14:54,670 --> 00:14:56,440
Let me tell you, the goods you handled

221
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:57,960
can't be sold at a good price.

222
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:59,640
Just stop the act.

223
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:01,640
I can only make the junk

224
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:02,960
you gave me this way.

225
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,600
It's good enough
to have something to sell.

226
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:05,730
What else are you thinking?

227
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,120
Alright,

228
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:14,760
I know a place.

229
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,680
I'll take you there to check it out.

230
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:23,800
Captain Zhu,

231
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:25,760
after Xiahou Xiong's gang was taken down,

232
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,360
things were calm for a while.

233
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,720
Now they're dealing drugs again.

234
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,840
Do you think if Wu hadn't died,

235
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:32,360
he might be involved in this?

236
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:34,600
Hard to say.

237
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:35,720
But

238
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,040
since they're making moves,

239
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,080
there must be some clues.

240
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:40,800
Captain Zhu,

241
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:41,760
the lab report is out.

242
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:42,600
Take a look.

243
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,040
Is it the same as what
we confiscated before?

244
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:45,280
Not at all.

245
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,510
The formula is a mess,
the purity is very low,

246
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:48,660
and the craftsmanship is poor.

247
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:50,440
That's why he reacted so strongly

248
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:51,670
when we caught him.

249
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,080
So it's not the goods from Wu.

250
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:56,920
A folk formula.

251
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:58,440
This indicates

252
00:15:59,590 --> 00:16:00,880
there's local drug manufacturing.

253
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:13,280
Ye Zhen,

254
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:15,920
we can't keep living in the past.

255
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:20,200
We should say goodbye to him by now.

256
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,720
Why not let yourself go?

257
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:24,760
They really need

258
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:25,760
patience,

259
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:26,680
tolerance,

260
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:27,600
and care.

261
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:29,360
If Li Na

262
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:32,240
had been a bit more caring
and tolerant towards him,

263
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:34,480
he wouldn't have ended up like that.

264
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:48,940
(Zhu Huaiyang)

265
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:56,140
(Zhu Huaiyang)

266
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:01,680
Hello.

267
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:04,440
Ye Zhen, I heard about
what happened today.

268
00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:05,390
How are you?

269
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:07,780
I'm fine, don't worry.

270
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,060
Haven't you gone home yet?

271
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:11,770
We got some leads,

272
00:17:11,770 --> 00:17:13,160
so we're heading to the bar street.

273
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:14,560
Be careful then,

274
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:16,080
and get some rest early.

275
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:17,000
You too.

276
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:18,480
Huaiyang.

277
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:19,520
What's up?

278
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:21,800
Tomorrow is

279
00:17:22,390 --> 00:17:23,480
our day off.

280
00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:27,120
What do you plan to cook for me?

281
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:29,640
What do you feel like eating?

282
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:33,120
Beef noodles.

283
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,360
Sure, I'll make them for you.

284
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:36,840
Okay,

285
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,140
bye.

286
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:39,000
Bye-bye.

287
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,320
Captain Zhu.

288
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:25,600
Hello.

289
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:26,920
Hello, hello, hello.

290
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:28,440
- Hello, hello.
- What a coincidence

291
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,450
to see you here.

292
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:31,760
I'm waiting for some friends here.

293
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:34,600
Are you here to have fun?

294
00:18:35,650 --> 00:18:37,560
Yeah, I've got a few clients

295
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:39,680
who are really satisfied
with my products.

296
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:42,200
They insisted on treating me here.

297
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:47,000
By the way, I haven't formally
introduced myself yet.

298
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:49,040
Here's my business card.

299
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:54,110
I run a beauty salon.

300
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:56,120
My name is Ai Lian.

301
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:57,040
I know, I know.

302
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:58,200
Thank you.

303
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:02,770
Our salon's products
are really great for the skin.

304
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:05,130
- Is that so?
- With no chemical additives at all.

305
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:07,760
Yeah, look at my skin.

306
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:08,750
Doesn't it look great?

307
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,320
It's pretty good.

308
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:13,200
If Captain Ye has time,

309
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,280
invite her over to my salon

310
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:15,520
for a beauty treatment.

311
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:16,560
Sure, sure.

312
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:17,480
Okay.

313
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:18,560
Sorry,

314
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:19,920
I drank a bit too much just now.

315
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:25,840
I really believe

316
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,320
in our products,

317
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:28,260
so I couldn't help

318
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:29,160
but give you a little pitch.

319
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:30,320
No problem, no problem.

320
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:31,760
By the way,

321
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,680
I can offer a discount

322
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:35,240
to you and Captain Ye's friends.

323
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:37,480
Great. Thank you in advance.

324
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:38,720
You're welcome.

325
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:40,680
Why don't you come in

326
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:41,960
and have a drink with us?

327
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:42,960
Come on.

328
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:46,440
I... I'm allergic to alcohol,

329
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,520
so I can only drink this.

330
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:51,960
You guys go ahead, have fun.

331
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:53,320
Oh, sorry then.

332
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:54,240
I won't disturb you.

333
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:55,560
Okay.

334
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:56,440
I'll go in first.

335
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:57,360
Okay.

336
00:19:57,850 --> 00:19:58,720
Okay, bye.

337
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,480
Bye-bye.

338
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:31,520
What's the matter?

339
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:33,760
Can't you be more professional?

340
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:42,700
What's it now?

341
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:45,120
The mask is for covering your face.

342
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:47,120
Just cover your face.

343
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,560
Your hair isn't even covered.

344
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:49,480
Look at you.

345
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:52,480
Who are you to tell me what to do?

346
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:53,840
Get the stuff.

347
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:14,540
(Warehouse Restricted Area, No Entry)

348
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,880
Where are you going? It's here.

349
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:43,200
Lift it.

350
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:44,720
One, two, three, lift.

351
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:46,760
Put harder!

352
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:48,160
- I can't lift it.
- Are you crazy?

353
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:49,040
The guard will be back.

354
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:50,160
Just grab two bottles and go.

355
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:10,600
There is...

356
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:11,720
Someone in the warehouse!

357
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,320
The warehouse.

358
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:51,560
Mad Dog.

359
00:23:58,720 --> 00:23:59,760
The raw materials.

360
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:04,400
The raw materials are important.

361
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:32,480
Do you need help?

362
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:35,520
No.

363
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:37,280
You finally have a day off.

364
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:38,560
Just watch TV.

365
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,040
Let me help you.

366
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:42,200
It will be faster.

367
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:43,880
Alright.

368
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:45,640
Wash the vegetables.

369
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:46,880
Okay.

370
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:52,560
Huaiyang,

371
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:54,920
thank you for all these years.

372
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:57,840
What are you talking about?

373
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,360
Serving my wife is my honor.

374
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:05,240
All done.

375
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:10,160
Actually, I thought about letting it go,

376
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:12,760
but it's too difficult.

377
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,120
What are you saying?

378
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:19,840
Hello.

379
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:22,720
The criminal police are here.

380
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:23,720
They said this case

381
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:25,080
might be related to drugs.

382
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:27,120
Okay, I got it.

383
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,320
Well,

384
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:36,600
looks like I won't be able

385
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:38,360
to eat the beef noodles.

386
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:40,320
Alright then,

387
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:41,920
once the water boils,

388
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:43,560
put the noodles in.

389
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:44,760
Wait for two minutes,

390
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:46,440
and put the beef gravy in,

391
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:47,400
and then the toppings.

392
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:49,560
Help yourself.

393
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,200
Alright, save one bowl for me.

394
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,320
Or half a bowl would do.

395
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:54,560
I'm off.

396
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:55,720
Be careful.

397
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:36,560
Mom.

398
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:38,160
Liu Danyang,

399
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:40,400
you didn't even tell me
you're dating someone.

400
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:41,720
Don't listen to his nonsense.

401
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:42,560
I'm not.

402
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:43,480
What's his name?

403
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:44,680
Is he handsome?

404
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:46,040
Is he tall?

405
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:47,240
Where are his parents from?

406
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:48,680
Where does he work?

407
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:50,200
I really am not.

408
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:52,880
Can't you just let me explain?

409
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,760
It's not right to admit it,

410
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:58,320
but also not right to deny it.

411
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:00,600
It all depends on whether
she can figure it out.

412
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:02,720
Our Danyang

413
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:04,640
just hasn't come to her senses.

414
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:09,120
I really want to know
what type of guy she likes.

415
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:12,040
I know what type she likes.

416
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:13,480
What type?

417
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:16,800
That guy is from our sports school.

418
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:18,320
I think

419
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:21,280
that guy also has a bit
of a crush on Liu Danyang.

420
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:23,560
They climbed mountains together before.

421
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,160
Liu Danyang asked him,

422
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:26,640
"Do you believe

423
00:28:26,650 --> 00:28:28,160
I can climb to the top
in just one hour?"

424
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:30,320
He said, "I don't believe you."

425
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:31,160
And then?

426
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:32,080
Then she got angry?

427
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:33,000
No,

428
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:34,280
she got competitive.

429
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:36,920
So Liu Danyang turned around
and started climbing,

430
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:38,200
without looking back.

431
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:41,000
She was so fast that
the guy couldn't even

432
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:41,920
see her anymore.

433
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:44,000
And then?

434
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:46,200
After that, he never saw

435
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:47,520
Liu Danyang again.

436
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:52,030
Isn't she silly?

437
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:53,480
What are you laughing at?

438
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:55,800
Nothing.

439
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,080
I told them

440
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:58,640
mountain climbing is your thing.

441
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:00,440
Of course.

442
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:03,280
Back in sports school,

443
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:05,680
it would take guys two or three hours,

444
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:07,400
but I

445
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:09,080
could do it in just one hour.

446
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:12,960
That's why you're called
the "Mountain pro".

447
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:14,280
I'll learn from you.

448
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:23,220
(Police)

449
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,040
What's the situation?

450
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:27,600
Captain Zhu,

451
00:29:27,710 --> 00:29:28,560
last night,

452
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:31,040
two people broke into
Yongsheng Pharmaceutical Factory

453
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:32,080
to steal raw materials.

454
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:33,640
Raw materials?

455
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:34,640
Yes.

456
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:35,600
Did they steal anything else?

457
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:36,520
Well,

458
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:40,560
here's the list of stolen items
the factory provided.

459
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:41,480
Take a look.

460
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:45,120
What did the criminal police say?

461
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:46,440
They didn't find anything.

462
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:49,240
The suspects had their faces covered
and their license plates blocked.

463
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:51,860
The only information
they can give us is that

464
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:54,200
after they realized they were exposed,

465
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:55,400
they attacked the guard.

466
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:57,440
The guard is still in the hospital now.

467
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:26,960
What are you doing?

468
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:30,520
I'm sorry.

469
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:31,760
Crazy.

470
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:27,360
Son.

471
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,080
Who was that person

472
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:30,720
you were talking to just now?

473
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:33,840
My friend.

474
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:35,200
A good person.

475
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,200
The source of my happiness.

476
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,600
What good person, son?

477
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:40,640
I just can't see him as a good person.

478
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,440
- Don't see him anymore.
- Dad, come on.

479
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:43,520
Can you control me,

480
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:44,480
or can you control them?

481
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,560
You can't protect me.

482
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:48,920
Just leave me alone.

483
00:31:49,710 --> 00:31:50,960
No, you...

484
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:10,760
Have you eaten?

485
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:20,160
That can fill your stomach?

486
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:22,040
Give it to me.

487
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:23,080
What are you doing?

488
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:24,200
I want to see my son.

489
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:25,240
What are you doing?

490
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:27,000
You don't eat or drink all day.

491
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:28,200
Do you think that will help?

492
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:30,120
You sleep well and eat well.

493
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:33,160
How long has it been since our son left?

494
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:34,760
You've already forgotten him.

495
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,480
If you're too afraid
to see him, then don't.

496
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:40,600
Why do you still want to control me?

497
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:43,040
Who said I'm afraid to see him?

498
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:44,640
You're just feeling guilty.

499
00:32:46,090 --> 00:32:48,800
You could have saved him.

500
00:32:49,890 --> 00:32:51,720
You could have saved him!

501
00:32:52,230 --> 00:32:54,200
But you were too concerned

502
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:55,220
about saving face,

503
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:58,080
so you kept it hidden.

504
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:00,920
You could have saved him.

505
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:01,840
Enough!

506
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:04,440
Are you done?

507
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:07,640
If you can't get over it,
let's get a divorce.

(Policewoman's Mini-Class)
Giving your own child to someone else

510
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:43,040
can potentially be considered a crime.

511
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:45,640
For example, if it's done
for the purpose of illegal profit,

512
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:47,800
whether or not the child is your own,

513
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:50,280
it should be treated
as child trafficking.

514
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:53,000
If there is a legitimate reason,

515
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,520
both the giver and the receiver
must meet certain conditions,

516
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:58,840
and they must register
the adoption legally.

517
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:00,440
If someone gives up a child privately,

518
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:02,960
and it results in serious physical
or mental harm to the child,

519
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:04,640
or other flagrant circumstances,

520
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:06,320
it will be considered child abandonment.
