Sorry, I didn't know it was you.

I thought you were a bad person.

28
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:52,080
- It's fine.
- Who is it?

29
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:54,520
Isn't this the guy you hit that day?

30
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:56,600
The blind date?

31
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,000

00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,040
What is this?

36
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:16,960
Peach blossoms.

37
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,200
The peach tree beams so red,

38
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:20,600
how brilliant are its flowers!

39
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,320
The peach tree beams so red,

40
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:24,640
how brilliant are its flowers!

41
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,640
Stop.

42
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:26,560
Wait a moment.

43
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,840
You don't like the Book of Songs?

44
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,000
Let me put it more simply then.

45
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,360
Miss Liu Danyang,

46
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:36,280
since we last met,

47
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:37,640
my mom has

48
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:40,200
introduced me to many other girls.

49
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,240
But every time I meet with them,

50
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:44,000
your image keeps popping up in my mind.

51
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,240
I just can't stop thinking about you.

52
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:49,040
After seriously thinking it through,

53
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:49,960
I realized

54
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,500
the person I'm looking for

55
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:52,520
has to be someone like you.

56
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:53,960
Pure,

57
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,520
straightforward, with principles.

58
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,480
So,

59
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,400
after endless thinking,

60
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,720
I think

61
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:03,520
you can be with me.

62
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:11,540
No, no.

63
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:12,760
Uh...

64
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:14,280
Your name is...

65
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,200
Eric.

66
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:16,800
Mr. Eric,

67
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:17,880
I think

68
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,530
you seem to have

69
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:20,760
a misunderstanding about us.

70
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:22,440
Yes, there's a misunderstanding.

71
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,000
No,

72
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:25,280
to be precise,

73
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:26,880
it's my fault.

74
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:28,840
Your emergency response

75
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:29,960
was no problem.

76
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:32,320
It actually proves
your high moral standards.

77
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:34,320
You won't easily let others
take advantage of you.

78
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,240
Why do I always want to hit you

79
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,920
as soon as I see you?

80
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,240
Danyang.

81
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:43,840
I oppose violence,

82
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
but I can accept diversity in things.

83
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:48,880
Maybe,

84
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,960
this is just your way
of expressing emotions.

85
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,120
If you want to
express emotions this way,

86
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,160
I can exercise

87
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:57,360
and spar with you.

88
00:03:58,720 --> 00:03:59,640
Come, hit me.

89
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:02,540
Hit me.

90
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:04,340
Danyang, hit me.

91
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:05,900
Danyang, come on.

92
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:09,340
- Okay, I will.
- Hit me.

93
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:12,500
- Calm down.
- Hit me.

94
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:13,940
- Calm down.
- Is there a problem?

95
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:15,580
Song Tiancheng.

96
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:18,260
Tiancheng.

97
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:19,180
We are colleagues.

98
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:20,220
Do me a favor.

99
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:24,180
No.

100
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:25,700
You guys...

101
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:27,380
He...

102
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:29,290
My boyfriend.

103
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:34,140
No way.

104
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:35,300
You're so violent.

105
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:36,340
Who else

106
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:37,260
could accept you except me?

107
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:38,580
Good girls are like this.

108
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:40,440
They're fierce to boys

109
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:41,320
who don't concern them,

110
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:42,640
but sweet to

111
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:43,620
their boyfriends.

112
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:44,540
Understand?

113
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:46,530
Really sweet.

114
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:49,940
Danyang.

115
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:51,980
If you don't want to be with me,

116
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:54,700
you don't have to find
someone like this to anger me.

117
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:56,140
He dislikes you.

118
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:00,620
We're getting married.

119
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:02,500
Stop bothering Danyang.

120
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:04,580
Leave.

121
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:14,380
No way.

122
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:17,220
I don't believe it.

123
00:05:18,170 --> 00:05:19,220
No way.

124
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:27,780
A quick rescue, thanks.

125
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:29,380
Mission complete. See you.

126
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:31,060
Let me treat you to a meal, bye.

127
00:05:33,010 --> 00:05:34,500
- Nice job, Danyang.
- Come clean.

128
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,900
- Tying the knot?
- What's your relationship?

129
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:36,780
What?

130
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:37,700
It's fake.

131
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:39,100
- What?
- You were holding hands.

132
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:40,220
Take it away, take it away.

133
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:41,260
We're getting married.

134
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:42,580
I think it's not bad.

135
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:43,700
I can't take it anymore.

136
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:45,060
- Let's go, let's go.
- Who wants it?

137
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:46,100
I don't want it.

138
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:48,500
Let's go.

139
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:49,420
Hurry up.

140
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:53,540
You're early. Good.

141
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:55,100
Thank you for coming today.

142
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:56,980
Yun'er will be very happy to know.

143
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:58,500
That's very kind of you.

144
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:01,180
We rarely come to watch
dance performances.

145
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:02,500
It's really an honor.

146
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:06,580
She must be dumbfounded this time.

147
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:08,060
She didn't even get a ranking.

148
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:09,900
How embarrassing.

149
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:11,980
You underestimate Chen Yun'er too much.

150
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:13,060
What's the big deal?

151
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:15,500
She's not just anyone.

152
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:19,780
Fang Fang.

153
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:21,900
Forget it, don't tell Yun'er.

154
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:23,340
This way.

155
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:24,260
Okay.

156
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:26,860
Yun'er, look who's here.

157
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:29,100
Mom, Fang Fang, Sister, you're all here.

158
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:30,020
Yun'er.

159
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:31,980
You're amazing.

160
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:34,140
You danced so well.

161
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:35,540
You danced great.

162
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:36,860
Thank you, Tata.

163
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:39,620
We all think you danced really well.

164
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:40,860
But your leg injury isn't healed yet.

165
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:42,380
Mom, you don't have to comfort me.

166
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:43,740
I lost. Don't worry.

167
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:45,100
I'm okay with it.

168
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:48,620
In life, there are many things
worth thinking about.

169
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:51,900
I shouldn't dwell on the past.

170
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:53,620
I should look forward.

171
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:55,380
That's the right thing to do.

172
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:57,380
That's the right way to think.

173
00:06:57,380 --> 00:06:59,170

00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:00,900
Rest first. Don't wait for me.

193
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:02,260
I'll be back soon.

194
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:06,140
Alright.

195
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:08,020
I'll wait for you at home.

196
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:09,380
Okay, see you then.

197
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:10,300
Bye.

198
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:18,100
- Take care.
- Okay.

199
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:20,340
You don't need to see us off.

200
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:21,220
Okay, take care.

201
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:22,860
- Bye, bye.
- Goodbye.

202
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:24,840
- Bye.
- Goodbye.

203
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,070
Goodbye, Tata.

204
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:26,920
Take care of your leg.

205
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,420
Okay, I will. Bye.

206
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:35,860
You seem to really admire Officer An.

207
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,820
After I left,

208
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:39,060
did you change your mind?

209
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:40,780
What, is that not okay?

210
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:42,180
Of course, it's not okay.

211
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:45,510
I want to become a strong,

212
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:47,210
brave girl like her.

213
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:51,900
Luckily, Song Tiancheng
showed up in time.

214
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:52,980
Otherwise,

215
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:54,890
Danyang would be off the market today.

216
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:56,180
I was scared.

217
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:02,060
Does this count as a hero
saving the beauty?

218
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:04,300
I'm not sure about the beauty part.

219
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:07,020
But the hero part,
he's definitely heroic.

220
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:09,140
Danyang, don't be humble.

221
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:09,990
You're so beautiful.

222
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:12,260
I'm trying to be.

223
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:14,620
But becoming beautiful
is so troublesome.

224
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:16,070
It isn't troublesome.

225
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:21,100
Do you really like Song Tiancheng?

226
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:23,540
Nonsense.

227
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:24,860

Nana!

244
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:42,940
Nana.

245
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:45,380
I know I was wrong this time.

246
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:47,780
Please give me another chance, okay?

247
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:49,380
Please open the door.

248
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:52,420
Luo Zhongliang,
sign the divorce agreement.

249
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:53,780
Stop bothering me.

250
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:54,980
Nana.

251
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:57,740
This time I was out of my mind, but...

252
00:11:58,020 --> 00:11:59,980
But a child can't grow up
without a father.

253
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:02,020
Now you realize you're the father?

254
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:05,220
You had to wait for a paternity test

255
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:06,700
and for this to escalate to a divorce.

256
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:07,820
It's all because of you.

257
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:10,700
Nana, please give me
another chance, okay?

258
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:12,980
Nana, I beg you, Nana.

259
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:14,580
We can't go back.

260
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:15,500
Go.

261
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:18,460
Babe.

262
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:21,540
Nana.

263
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:23,340
Nana.

264
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:25,180
Nana, what's wrong with the baby?

265
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:27,500
Is he crying?

266
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:28,900
Nana.

267
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:30,580
Nana, Nana.

268
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:35,100
Don't come closer.

269
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:39,220
Nana.

270
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:41,780
It's all my fault.

271
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:43,100
I was wrong.

272
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:44,340
It's all my fault.

273
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:45,820
Please forgive me, Nana.

274
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:47,260
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

275
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:49,140
Enough, enough. Get up.

276
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:53,580
Have you forgiven me?

277
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:55,340
Don't do this.

278
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:58,420
Nana.

279
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:02,100
Have you forgiven me?

280
00:13:04,070 --> 00:13:05,860
Now that it's come to this,

281
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:08,290
we can't go back.

282
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,180
For the sake of the baby,

283
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:20,860
let's part on good terms.

284
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:22,900
Isn't that better?

285
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:24,980
For the sake of the baby,

286
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:27,860
we shouldn't separate.

287
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:30,840
We should stay together as a family.

288
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:34,140
Do you think my dad

289
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:35,260
opposed us being together

290
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:36,660
because you were poor?

291
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:38,660
It's because your overthinking.

292
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:39,660
You're insecure.

293
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:40,820
You're mentally unhealthy.

294
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:45,100
I know

295
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:47,300
you've been good to me.

296
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:50,540
But that kind of goodness

297
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:53,700
puts so much pressure on me.

298
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:56,500
A normal marriage
shouldn't be like this.

299
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:58,180
I can change.

300
00:13:58,180 --> 00:13:59,380
I really can.

301
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:01,260
I know I shouldn't have

302
00:14:01,410 --> 00:14:02,740
treated you like that.

303
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:10,450
This is the end for us.

304
00:14:29,630 --> 00:14:30,700
Nana.

305
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:36,460
Can I hold the baby one more time?

306
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:40,100
This should be

307
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:42,660
the last time I hold him.

308
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:46,620
Okay?

309
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:10,900
Babe.

310
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:13,740
Do you know who I am?

311
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:16,900
I'm your dad.

312
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:20,260
Babe.

313
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:23,580
Do you miss me?

314
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:28,660
I promise you,

315
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:31,140
I'll never leave you

316
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:34,540
this lifetime.

317
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:38,740
Zhongliang.

318
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:40,300
Give me the baby.

319
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:41,700
Don't...

320
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:42,780
Give me the baby.

321
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:44,740
Zhongliang.

322
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:46,300
Don't make me hate you forever.

323
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:49,940
Nana.

324
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:52,900
Without the baby

325
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:55,500
and you,

326
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:58,860
what's the point of my life?

327
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:01,780
You

328
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:03,580
and the baby,

329
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:06,300
that's what makes a complete family.

330
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:09,890
Give him to me, Zhongliang.

331
00:16:09,890 --> 00:16:11,360
Please, Zhongliang.

332
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:13,220
Give me the baby.

333
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:14,500
I can't live without the baby.

334
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:16,260
- Give him to me, please.
- Nana.

335
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:18,460
Nana, get up, Nana.

336
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:20,300
Give me the baby.

337
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:21,420
Nana.

338
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:22,940
Get up, Nana.

339
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:24,220
The baby.

340
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:27,300
Give me the baby.

341
00:16:28,050 --> 00:16:28,980
Luo Zhongliang!

342
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:30,860
- Nana, we've come to get you.
- Mom, Dad.

343
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:32,530
He's going to take my baby.

344
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:35,340
- Don't come closer. Don't push me.
- Luo Zhongliang, what are you doing?

345
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:37,580
- What are you doing?
- I'd rather we die together!

346
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:38,700
Don't come closer.

347
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:39,620
Dad!

348
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:43,300
Luo, don't. You'll scare the baby.

349
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:46,980
Luo Zhongliang, calm down.

350
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:48,340
Give me the baby.

351
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:51,220
He can't live without a father.

352
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:53,700
But he also can't live without a mother!

353
00:16:58,780 --> 00:16:59,900
You're right.

354
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:01,700
He can't live without a mother.

355
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:04,700
He can't live without a mother.

356
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:07,300
That's what makes a complete family.

357
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:11,170
Let's go, let's go.

358
00:17:11,190 --> 00:17:12,540
- Nana, Nana.
- Dad.

359
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:13,860
- Luo Zhongliang.
- Hurry, Nana.

360
00:17:13,870 --> 00:17:15,500
- What are you doing?
- Nana.

361
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:16,420
Dad!

362
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:17,620
Mom!

363
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:18,540
Hurry.

364
00:17:20,110 --> 00:17:22,500
Nana! Luo Zhongliang,
what are you doing?

365
00:17:22,950 --> 00:17:23,940
- What are you doing?
- Nana.

366
00:17:24,050 --> 00:17:25,220
- Nana.
- Stop, stop.

367
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:26,770
- Luo Zhongliang, stop.
- Nana.

368
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:28,980
- Stop, stop.
- Nana.

369
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:31,540
Hurry, call the police.

370
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:33,260
Hummer Commandos, attention.

371
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:34,540
A knife conflict has occurred

372
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:36,420
in Building 2, Tiantian Village.

373
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:38,380
The suspect has taken
a woman and child hostage.

374
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:40,100
They got into a Hyundai sedan.

375
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:42,860
Plate number: HAC64570.

376
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:45,460
They're currently heading east
on Yingbin Avenue.

377
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:46,500
Please proceed.

378
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:47,420
Copy that.

379
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:53,420
Nana, don't be afraid.

380
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:54,720
Don't touch me!

381
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:05,060
Follow the car ahead.

382
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:13,460
Nana, hold on tight, Nana.

383
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:17,380
Captain, should we intercept?

384
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:18,620
There's a child in the car.

385
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:19,580
Don't get too close.

386
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:21,460
I'm afraid the suspect
might act aggressively.

387
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:22,660
Just follow it.

388
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:23,580
Got it.

389
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:28,780
Get out of the way!

390
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:35,140
He's losing control of his emotions.

391
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:36,620
He might hurt the baby.

392
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:37,940
Discontinue pursuit.

393
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:39,460
Keep a safe distance.

394
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:40,530
Execute Plan B.

395
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:56,900
Keep a distance. Don't disturb him.

396
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:57,820
Got it.

397
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:05,060
Attention, all departments.

398
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:06,180
Suspect's identity confirmed.

399
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:07,300
(Personal Information)
He's Luo Zhongliang.

400
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:08,460
No criminal record.

401
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:10,100
He was suspicious
that the child wasn't his,

402
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:11,970
and is currently in a divorce
with his wife, Li Na.

403
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:13,210
Luo Zhongliang?

404
00:19:13,790 --> 00:19:15,370
Not that Luo Zhongliang, right?

405
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:18,420
It really is him.

406
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:21,570
The records show

407
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:23,700
they've already done a paternity test.

408
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:25,500
The child is indeed Luo Zhongliang's.

409
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,220
He is now seeking reconciliation,

410
00:19:28,050 --> 00:19:28,980
but hasn't succeeded.

411
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:30,180
Xin, go faster.

412
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,360
The signal is lost.

413
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:32,580
Okay.

414
00:19:37,430 --> 00:19:38,340
Nana.

415
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:39,620
Don't touch me.

416
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:42,620
Nana, you don't have to be afraid of me.

417
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:45,100
How could I hurt you and the baby?

418
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:47,460
You two are my life.

419
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:51,340
Back then, I pointed a knife at you

420
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:52,900
because I had no choice.

421
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:54,500
I had no choice.

422
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:55,420
They wouldn't let you

423
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:56,860
and the baby go with me.

424
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:04,860
How did it come to this?

425
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:08,100
I only made one mistake.

426
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:11,100
Can't you give me another chance?

427
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:21,180
Luo Zhongliang?

428
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:23,420
This is Captain Ye Zhen
from Hummer Commandos.

429
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:24,540
Do you remember me?

430
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:26,820
Captain Ye, I'm Nana.

431
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:28,420
Nana.

432
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:29,490
Put the speaker on.

433
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:30,760
I need to talk to Luo Zhongliang.

434
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:33,100
Luo Zhongliang.

435
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:35,100
From what I remember,
you were very considerate towards Li Na.

436
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:36,380
You were a good husband.

437
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:37,660
Why are you doing this?

438
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:39,180
They forced me.

439
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:41,460
They want to tear our family apart.

440
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:44,340
Do you really care about your son?

441
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:45,820
Of course, he's my child,

442
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:46,900
my own flesh and blood.

443
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:48,580
He has my blood running through him.

444
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:51,100
Babe.

445
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:52,780
Babe, stop crying.

446
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:54,740
Why is the baby crying so much?

447
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:56,180
Is he hungry?

448
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:58,100
Did you feed him?

449
00:20:58,100 --> 00:20:59,140
No.

450
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:01,350
The bottle is at home.

451
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,620
He was born not long ago, right?

452
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:08,660
What's his name?

453
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:10,140
His name is Luo Tianyou.

454
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:13,140
We all call him Babe.

455
00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:16,150
Tianyou, that's a good name.

456
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:18,380
Luo Zhongliang, how about

457
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:20,580
you pull over for a moment.

458
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:22,340
I'll send someone with some formula.

459
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:23,380
He can't go hungry for too long.

460
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:24,700
I'm not stopping!

461
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:26,700
Officer Ye, do you think I'm stupid?

462
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:27,580
If I stop the car,

463
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:28,580
you'll take me away,

464
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:30,820
and I'll never see Nana
and the baby again.

465
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:32,460
You're mistaken.

466
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:33,940
I'm thinking for the baby's sake.

467
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:37,140
Listen to how hard he is crying.

468
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:38,700
His throat is nearly hoarse.

469
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:40,380
I'm not listening.

470
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:42,140
I'm not listening. I'm not listening.

471
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:43,860
- Go away!
- Luo Zhongliang.

472
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:46,860
Captain, they've turned
onto a small road.

473
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:51,260
Nana.

474
00:21:51,290 --> 00:21:52,500
Let go of me!

475
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:54,900
Zhongliang, please.

476
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:56,540
Let us go.

477
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:00,420
Nana.

478
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:02,940
Do you still not believe me?

479
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:05,660
In your heart, I'm no longer
part of your family, right?

480
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:07,420
Am I that terrifying?

481
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:10,100
I don't know.

482
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:11,940
You've changed.

483
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:14,260
I don't even recognize you anymore.

484
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:15,860
What did I do wrong?

485
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:16,780
Huh?

486
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:20,340
Why does everyone treat me like this?

487
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:21,940
Why?

488
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,140
All I wanted was a family.

489
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:27,220
I just wanted us to be together forever.

490
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:29,700
Why is it so hard?

491
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:31,980
Why is it so difficult?

492
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:34,340
You want to take care of us

493
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:37,020
and make it up to us.

494
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:40,140
But the reality is,
the police car is chasing us,

495
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:41,860
and the baby hasn't even been fed.

496
00:22:42,150 --> 00:22:44,020
Is this the life you wanted?

497
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:08,220
According to the info,

498
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:10,140
Luo Zhongliang is an abandoned child.

499
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:11,900
He grew up in an orphanage

500
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:12,780
and has a low education.

501
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:14,260
He dropped out of high school

502
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:16,900
and has worked in
various car repair shops.

503
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:18,780
Never stayed in one place
for more than a year.

504
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:21,140
Three years ago, he married Li Na,

505
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:22,620
and has staying at a car repair shop

506
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:23,540
until now.

507
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:25,740
Looking at it now,

508
00:23:26,060 --> 00:23:27,260
Binjiang must be the place

509
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:29,020
he's stayed the longest in recent years.

510
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:32,060
How could parents

511
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:34,060
abandon their own child?

512
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:35,230
Children like him

513
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:36,940
must grow up feeling insecure.

514
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:40,100
That's why, he's so insecure

515
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:41,420
with Li Na

516
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:44,140
and reacts so extremely.

517
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:46,300
Tata, haven't you found them yet?

518
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:47,300
Not yet.

519
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:48,860
There's still some obstruction.

520
00:23:57,620 --> 00:23:58,980
Captain, I've found them.

521
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,380
Xin, turn right
at the intersection ahead.

522
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:03,220
Okay.

523
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:04,260
Where are you taking us?

524
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:14,260
I'm taking you away from here

525
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:16,340
to start over.

526
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:21,260
Where exactly are you taking us?

527
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:31,220
I'm taking you both

528
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:34,100
back home.

529
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:20,660
Captain.

530
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:21,580
Nothing.

531
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:22,700
Captain.

532
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:23,860
We've checked the surroundings.

533
00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:25,060
No suspicious leads found.

534
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:27,780
Captain.

535
00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:29,060
Information from the welfare house.

536
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:31,740
(Binjiang Police System)
Luo Zhongliang was adopted twice

537
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:33,460
between the ages of 7 and 13.

538
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:35,780
But for some reason, he secretly ran back

539
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:37,460
to the welfare house
within six months each time.

540
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:40,380
The first time he ran back
from the adoptive family,

541
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:41,620
he wasn't taken back.

542
00:26:41,620 --> 00:26:43,460
But the second time he ran back,

543
00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:45,460
he was taken back
by the adoptive family.

544
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:49,500
Could it be that he went
to the welfare house?

545
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:50,820
No way.

546
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:52,860
The second year after
Luo Zhongliang was adopted,

547
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:54,260
the welfare house
had already relocated.

548
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:56,460
The original location
had been abandoned.

549
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:58,980
Luo Zhongliang's spent his whole life

550
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:00,300
searching for a home.

551
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:03,260
He can't go back to the home
in Binjiang anymore.

552
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:07,830
Luo, check the surveillance

553
00:27:07,850 --> 00:27:09,860
near the old site
of Sunshine Welfare House.

554
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:11,420
I suspect he went back there.

555
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:12,500
Okay.

556
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:16,340
Two adoptions,

557
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:17,780
and he ran away both times.

558
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:20,260
Luo Zhongliang's adoption experiences

559
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,080
must have been really unhappy.

560
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:23,740
Maybe so.

561
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:25,220
Let's go.

Captain Ye, you were right.

565
00:27:57,340 --> 00:27:59,020
Luo Zhongliang did go
to the welfare house.

566
00:27:59,140 --> 00:28:00,500
He got off the bus with Li Na

567

the welfare house is on the line.

572
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:14,460
I remember Luo Zhongliang.

573
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:17,060
He was a very kind child

574
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:21,660
but also an extremely sensitive one.

575
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:23,860
Has he gotten into any trouble?

576
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:25,020

577

I'm not free to discuss the case.

578
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:28,860
But could you tell me more

579
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:30,180
about Luo Zhongliang's background?

580
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:33,210
You know that

581
00:28:33,210 --> 00:28:35,860
he ran away from his
adoptive families twice, right?

582
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:37,060
Yes.

583
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:38,580
Was it because they treated him badly?

584
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:40,780
Of course not.
