That's amazing, son!

You didn't let me down.

28

You've brought glory to the Li family.

- Kid!
- So proud of you.

30

We should celebrate!

Yes! Let your mom fry you
some chicken legs.

Please count it.

37
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,260
That's a full year's rent.

38
00:02:58,920 --> 00:02:59,840
The money's right.

39
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:01,200
Here's the contract and the keys.

40
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,280
Take good care of them.

41
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,240
Since that incident last time,

42
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,920
nobody wanted to rent this place.

43
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:09,920
Good thing you rented it.

44
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:12,240
Otherwise, I'd be losing a lot of money.

45
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:13,960
I'm sorry.

46
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:15,200
Don't talk about it.

47
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,120
You're sincere,

48
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,200
and I appreciate that.

49
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:18,680

55
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:36,280
I had a movie date with my parents at Xinjie.

56
00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:37,280
Bye-bye.

57
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,960
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

58
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,160
Wait.

59
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,440
I'm coming too.

Where are you going?

62
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,160
Meeting Chen Yun'er.

63
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:49,920
Chen Yun'er?

64
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:50,840
Since when

65
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:52,000
did you get so close to her?

66
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,600
Bye-bye.

67
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:58,480

68

Why don't you go home too?

69
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:03,360
No way I'm going home.

70
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:05,760
Mrs. Lin's been forcing me
to go on blind dates non-stop.

71
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,200
Go home?

72
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:11,320
Oh no.

73
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,240
What happened?

74
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,920
I promised Lin I'd be home. I'm late!

75
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:15,600
I'm leaving now!

76
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,480
Take it easy.

77
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,120
Only the two of us are left.

78
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:27,160
So what should we do?

79
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:31,600
Go shopping?

80
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:33,600
Okay.

You're acting strange today.

Not only did you go shopping with me,

87
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:40,300
you even bought so many clothes.

88
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:43,260

89

You're the one with a crush.

94
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:51,540
Your whole family's got a crush.

95
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:53,420
Keep this up,

96
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:54,580
and I'm not shopping with you.

97
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:56,060
Okay, okay.

98
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:57,020

Okay?

101

Something's up. Who is it?

102
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:05,820
Well, this person

103
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:07,140
is really tall,

104
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:08,460
kind of handsome too.

105
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:10,980
You're totally love-struck.

106

Not only is he handsome,

107
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:13,580
he's agile too,

108
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:15,140
and super gentlemanly.

109
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:20,260

110
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:22,140

Love has you seeing a prince
where others see a frog, right?

You don't get it.

It's my choice, I'm happy.

Mad Dog, come on.

128
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:58,580
How could I not trust you?

129
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:00,100
It's pure.

130
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:01,020
Definitely pure.

131
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:10,340
I hate it when people
smoke in front of me.

132
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:11,980
Are you nuts?

133
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:14,100
You really think

134
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:15,740
you're something now?

135
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:17,660
If I hadn't saved you,

136
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:19,100
you'd have been beaten to death.

137
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:21,180
If I didn't know how to make drugs,

138
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:23,100
I'd be dead meat,

139
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:24,500
and you wouldn't even look my way.

140
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:39,500
Mad Dog.

141
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:41,580
I'm just joking. Don't get mad.

142
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:44,100
Mad Dog.

143
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:46,100
Don't be so harsh.

144
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:48,460
We've worked together for a while.

145
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:50,220
We're brothers now, for real.

146
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:52,140
Think about it.

From now on,

150
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:57,180
it's just us working on our own.

151
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:00,780

152
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:04,460

I heard

155
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:22,730
you were top of your class in chemistry.

156
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:25,380
With your skills,

157
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:27,100
you could've been a professor.

158
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:29,060
Why do this line of work?

159
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:32,700
What do you know?

160
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,260
A professor teaches a few students.

161
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:38,140
I want millions to obey me.

162
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:39,940
Only this stuff

163
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:42,500
can make that happen.

164
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:16,060

165
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:17,580

168
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:26,620
If we keep going like this,

169
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:28,180
the market will be ours.

170
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:29,780
I've lined up everyone already.

171
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:30,820
Just settle the price.

172
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:56,820
I thought about letting it go,

173
00:10:58,020 --> 00:10:59,380
but it's too difficult.

174
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:04,260
What are you saying?

175
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:13,140
Captain Zhu.

176
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:15,260
The lab reports are back.

177
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:16,420
Just as you suspected,

178
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:18,580
the stolen materials can
be used to make drugs,

179
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:20,540
and are of very high purity.

180
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:23,900
Got it.

181
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:20,900
You came here alone?

182
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:31,740
Sir, he's here.

183
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:33,340
Over here.

184
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:52,860
Sir, table for how many?

185
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:55,980
Table for how many?

186
00:15:57,900 --> 00:15:58,820
I... I...

187
00:15:58,820 --> 00:15:59,780
I'll just sit for a bit.

188
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:01,820
Sorry, sir.

189
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:02,980
We have a minimum charge.

190
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:04,180

191
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:05,100
you can't sit here.

00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:09,300
What's the minimum charge?

193
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:10,860
580.

194
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:11,780
580?

195
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:34,140
Sir.

196
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:35,380
First time here?

197
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:37,500
Let me order for you, sir.

198
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:40,100
I know which combos are the cheapest.

199
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:41,460
Don't let them rip you off.

200
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:55,900
Meet at the usual spot.

201
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:00,540
First time here?

202
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:01,620
This wine is good.

203
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:02,580
I'll drink one with you.

204
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:06,220
What are you looking at?

205
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:09,340
What's wrong, sir?

206
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:12,620
Sir?

207
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:20,020
Looking for someone?

208
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:27,860
Sorry.

209
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:29,620
I made a mistake.

210
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:35,060
Your mistake, sir.

211
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:36,700
Let's go.

212
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:41,380
Here you go.

213
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:42,660
Here.

214
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:43,940
Sir, here.

215
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:44,860
Your drink is here.

216
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:45,700
Here you go, sir.

217
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:47,060
We'll drink with you.

218
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:48,860
Drinking alone's no fun.

219
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:49,900
Exactly!

220
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:51,380
Come on, pour him wine.

221
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:52,740
Let's drink, let's drink!

222
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:54,300
Miss, miss.

223
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:56,540
Go home now.

224
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:58,460
Your family must be worried.

225
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:01,700
Sir,

226
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:02,860
do you know any games?

227
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:04,220
How about dice?

228
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:05,340
We can teach you that.

229
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:06,580
Come on, come on!

230
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:08,020
- Let's drink!
- Cheers!

231
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:09,100
- Come on!
- Drink up!

232
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:11,260
- This one.
- This one!

233
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:13,180
Come on, drink this one!

234
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:15,220
Bottoms up! Cheers!

235
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:21,460
Pour him more.

236
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:23,180
Sir, drink slowly.

237
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:24,860
Another one! One more!

238
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:27,180
Sir, you sure can drink!

239
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:29,100
Come on, drink more!

240
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:30,790
Let me pour you another!

241
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:15,980
Dad.

242
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:18,900
I have to go now.

243
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:24,340
I'll be your son again

244
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:27,900
in the next life.

245
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:33,820
You could've saved him.

246
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:36,180
You could've saved him!

247
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:38,460
But you were too concerned

248
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:39,420
about saving face.

249
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:40,340
Enough!

250
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:31,380
- Sir, sir.
- Sir?

251
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:32,300
- Wake up.
- Wake up.

252
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:33,620
Sir.

253
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:35,100
- Wake up!
- Wake up, sir!

254
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:37,540
Time to pay the bill.

255
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:40,180
Pay the bill.

256
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:41,100
Pay up.

257
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:42,460
How much?

258
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:43,620
18,000.

259
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:53,420
Mad Dog, you're already here.

260
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:54,540
Come in and enjoy yourself!

261
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:56,820
I don't like that place.

262
00:20:57,220 --> 00:20:58,860
Get the raw materials ready soon.

263
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:00,460
Skill alone isn't enough.

264
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:03,020
Mad Dog.

265
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:05,660
You can trust me on this.

266
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:07,340
You're so professional.

267
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:09,180
Of course I want to learn from you.

268
00:21:10,130 --> 00:21:11,020
Let's go have some fun!

269
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:12,460
Sir, had a good drink today?

270
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:13,700
No need to help me.

271
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:15,180
Careful walking, take it slow.

272
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:16,380
Get home safe.

273
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:17,580
- Alright.
- Sure.

274
00:21:17,590 --> 00:21:18,500
Okay.

275
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:19,660
Isn't he that...

276
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:21,420
Come visit again!

277
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:23,220
He sure knows how to party.

278
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:25,900
Come again next time,
we'll give you a discount!

279
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:28,500
Can't believe he came to this place.

280
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:30,100
- It's fine, it's fine.
- Sir,

281
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:31,020
you know him?

282
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:33,540
I more than know him.

283
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:35,100
He had a son

284
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:36,380
who used to buy my goods.

285
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:37,780
Now he's dead.

286
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:46,260
No wonder he's got money to blow here.

287
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:47,940
What are you implying?

288
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:51,500
Before his son died,

289
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:52,860
he stole a batch from me.

290
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:54,980
That must be how he got rich.

291
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:57,300
Otherwise, how could he
afford to party here?

292
00:21:57,460 --> 00:21:58,420
He wasn't that rich.

293
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:01,100
I don't have time for this.

294
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:02,220
Handle it yourself.

295
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:08,300
(Wallet)

296
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:53,500
What happened here?

297
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:56,580
Why did you drink so much?

298
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:57,900
Get up.

299
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:05,780
Drank so much.

300
00:23:10,290 --> 00:23:11,660
Here, drink some water.

301
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:26,540
Where did you go?

302
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:28,140
I called, but you didn't answer.

303
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:29,340
Have you eaten?

304
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:33,620
Xiaoling.

305
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:38,180
I've lived for so long,

306
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:41,380
but today,

307
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:42,820
I really saw the world.

308
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:46,020
That place

309
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:48,780
was full of young people.

310
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:50,180
The young girls

311
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:52,940
are all so pretty.

312
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:55,820
But I hadn't even finished my drink,

313
00:23:55,820 --> 00:23:57,180
and she was already pouring more.

314
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:01,780
And...

315
00:24:02,210 --> 00:24:03,180
Look at me.

316
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:04,780
This wrinkled old face.

317
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:08,780
I just can't compare to them.

318
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:10,780
What do you mean?

319
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:18,780
What are you doing?

320
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:25,380
I'm out working all day

321
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:27,100
to make money.

322
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:28,860
You think it's easy for me?

323
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:32,980
I come home to see your
gloomy face every day.

324
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:37,980
Let me tell you,

325
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:40,740
I don't want this life anymore.

326
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:42,980
Let's split up.

327
00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:46,260
Split up.

328
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:48,940
What did you say?

329
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:50,380
Split up!

330
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:54,180
Let me tell you,

331
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:56,380
in the past,

332
00:24:58,100 --> 00:25:00,620
I lived like a coward.

333
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:04,540
I was too honest.

334
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:07,260
I was afraid of this

335
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:09,860
and that.

336
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:12,140
But now,

337
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:15,820
I fear nothing.

338
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:17,660
(Divorce Agreement
Li Hao & Ma Xiaoling)

339
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:19,740
From now on, I'll find my own fun.

340
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:21,820
I'll do whatever I want.

341
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:23,940
No one can control me.

342
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:33,580
You're really divorcing me?

343
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:42,300
Just sign it.

344
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:45,580
From now on,

345
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:48,780
let's not hold each other back.

346
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:52,140
Okay?

347
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:07,820
Fine.

348
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:11,540
I understand now.

349
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:12,700
Son.

350
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:16,380
Don't worry.

351
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:20,900
I'll take care of your mother.

352
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:50,140
Nothing. There's nothing.

353
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:08,140
What are you doing?

354
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:10,900
Keep searching!

355
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:11,860
Alright, alright!

356
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:19,340
Did that old guy sell all the stuff?

357
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:42,580
Sir, are you sure it's okay

358
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:44,740
to mess up his house like this?

359
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:45,980
What if he calls the cops?

360
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:48,340
He won't.

361
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:50,220
He's hiding drugs.

362
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:51,700
Would he dare call the police?

363
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:53,090
What are you thinking?

364
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:10,120
Are you sure

365
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:11,760
he keeps the drugs at home?

366
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:12,820
What if...

367
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:28,260
Just spit it out, will you?

368
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:29,740
I'm listening.

369
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:34,460
I just mean

370
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:35,820
what if he hid the drugs

371
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:37,380
somewhere else.

372
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:39,660
What else could he hide?

373
00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:50,940
You little punk.

374
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:52,860
I've been looking for you!

375
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:05,620
Hummer Commandos, attention.

376
00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:06,740
Police incident
on Xingfu Street.

377
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:08,260
Please go tackle it.

378
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:09,780
Copy that.

379
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:43,980
Sir,

380
00:32:44,540 --> 00:32:47,260
where are you taking me?

381
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:49,620
Sir,

382
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:51,940
I only went to your house because

383
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:53,540
your son stole my goods.

384
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:55,660
How about this,

385
00:32:55,660 --> 00:32:57,140
I won't ask for the goods back.

386
00:32:57,340 --> 00:32:58,460
Just let me go, okay?

387
00:32:58,460 --> 00:32:59,780
Please!

388
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:01,940
Come on!

389
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:05,980
At least take me to a hospital,

390
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:07,300
okay?

391
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:08,700
I'm bleeding here.

392
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:11,130
I'm gonna die!

393
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:13,180
Everyone dies.

394
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:22,580
Please! Spare me!

395
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:23,500
Please!

396
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:25,060
Please!

397
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:26,660
Please spare me!

398
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:28,580
I'm begging you.

399
00:33:29,020 --> 00:33:30,300
Please let me go!

400
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:36,900
What's going on? Give me a hand!

401
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:39,420
- Are you alright?
- You okay?

402
00:33:40,790 --> 00:33:41,700
Get him to the hospital.

403
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:44,810
- He ran off?
- What's wrong with him?

(Hummer Commandos)

405
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:54,660
He went that way! That way!

406
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:55,860
He's injured!

407
00:33:57,660 --> 00:33:58,580
He went that way.

408
00:33:58,900 --> 00:33:59,750
Danyang, Mai.

409
00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:00,880
Yes.

410
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:07,060
Tata, Wanru, move in.

411
00:34:07,060 --> 00:34:07,980
Yes.

414
