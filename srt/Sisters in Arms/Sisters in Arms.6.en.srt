Li Mingzhe and the hostage
are confirmed inside.

26
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:38,640
Prepare for action.

27
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,560
Yes.

28
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,520
Officer.

29
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:53,160
Where is my son?

30
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:54,360
We have already

31
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:55,880
located Li Mingzhe.

32
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:57,120
I hope you understand.

33
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:58,880
The more you tell us,

34
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,160
the more we can help him.

35
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,000
But...

36
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,000
I know

37
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,400
you love your son very much.

38
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,040
Maybe you've been hiding something.

39
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,880
But things have come to this point.

40
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:11,960
You can't hide anymore.

41
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:14,040
He's got a hostage now.

42
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,160
Only if we understand his demands

43
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,920
can we stop this from escalating.

44
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:21,240
Do you understand?

45
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:29,760
He...

46
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,200
He's using drugs.

47
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,040
Mingzhe.

48
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,960
- Dad.
- What are you doing?

49
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,600
Give it to me, give it to me.

50
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:40,520
Give it back, Dad!

51
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,160
Dad!

52
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,200
I beg you.

53
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:44,640
I won't touch it again.

54
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,240
Just give it to me. I feel awful.

55
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,160
How dare you touch

56
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,600
this kind of stuff?

57
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,360
Have you lost your mind?

58
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,160
Just this once, just one last time.

59
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,520
- Son.
- Never again I swear.

60
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,000
I won't do it again. Give it to me.

61
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,360
You can fight this, son.

62
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,640
I can't fight it!

63
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,560
Just this time, I forgive you okay?

64
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:04,880
Son. Son.

65
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:06,800
Son.

66
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,480
Stay in control, stay in control.

67
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:11,800
Son.

68
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:12,920
You can't take it.

69
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,080
Please.

70
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,000
Give it to me.

71
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,120
Son!

72
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,040
Li Mingzhe!

73
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:20,920
I never told anyone

74
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,400
about that matter.

75
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,400
Not even his mother.

76
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:27,760
But later,

77
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,120
every time he came home,

78
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,440
he would steal money to buy drugs.

79
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,680
I had thought about

80
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,440
sending him to rehab

81
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,480
to get him clean.

82
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,480
But if I did that,

83
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,520
everyone around would find out

84
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:42,480
and his life would be over.

85
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,800
My wife and I are uneducated.

86
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:46,960
No one has ever

87
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:50,120
respected us in this life.

88
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:51,920
I really don't know

89
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,320
how to raise a child.

90
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:56,760
I'm just a scrap collector.

91
00:03:58,680 --> 00:03:59,600
Alright.

92
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,520
We've understood the situation.

93
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,320
Thank you.

94
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,040
You're awake.

95
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,440
Mingzhe.

96
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:13,960
What is this?

97
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,160
I used to

98
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:20,320
see you as my best friend.

99
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,720
Before college,

100
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,760
I had never left home.

101
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,520
After I started college,

102
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:29,080
I realized I was a total nerd.

103
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,920
I didn't know how to socialize at all.

104
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,960
But you, the most popular guy ever,

105
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:36,240
hung out with me.

106
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,040
You showed me the world.

107
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:39,720
That's when I realized

108
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,640
I was good for nothing but studying.

109
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,280
I was so grateful to you back then.

110
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:50,360
And I really trusted you.

111
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,520
Mingzhe.

112
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,120
What's up, bro?

113
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,360
- Feeling good?
- Yeah!

114
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:04,120
Wanna feel even better?

115
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,760
There's something even better?

116
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:10,320
This stuff is amazing.

117
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,320
Costs hundreds per stick.

118
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,280
Bro.

119
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,480
It's not that stuff, is it?

120
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:19,880
No.

121
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,920
Relax, I've tried it.

122
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,040
It's totally fine.

123
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,560
You still don't trust me?

124
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,480
Didn't you always say

125
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,880
your dad puts too much pressure?

126
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,560
Once you smoke this,
there's no pressure.

127
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,200
Feels like you're flying in the sky,

128
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:41,040
soaring freely,

129
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,480
with no worries at all.

130
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,160
It's just awesome.

131
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:47,760
You lied to me.

132
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,720
You never used drugs.

133
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,920
I didn't force you.

134
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:54,080
You chose to take it yourself.

135
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:56,480
And I spent all my savings

136
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,000
just to buy it for you.

137
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,760
I chose to take it?

138
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,800
You made me addicted.

139
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:08,240
You watched me fall.

140
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:12,280
You watched me turn into a dog.

141
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,160
Help me.

142
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,200
Please help me.

143
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,360
I'm in too much pain.

144
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,720
Give me one more puff. Please.

145
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:20,920
Get off me.

146
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:24,360
This is how rich people play?

147
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,560
So fun, huh?

148
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:28,080
Mingzhe, I was young and dumb back then.

149
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,000
Look, let me make it up to you.

150
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,960
I have nothing now.

151
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,720
What can you use to make it up?

152
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:37,800
Money.

153
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,640
I have money. I can give you money.

154
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,600
Or whatever you want.

155
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,240
I'll do everything I can.

156
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:44,560
Alright?

157
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,480
I don't want your money.

158
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:52,040
Do one last thing for me, okay?

159
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:52,960
Just one last thing.

160
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,760
Alright, what is it?

161
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:07,820
(Climbing gear bag, restraint blanket)

162
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,160
This.

163
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,280
It's good stuff.

164
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,120
Help me.

165
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:16,040
Today's your big day.

166
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,600
Help me. It'll be fun.

167
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,520
It'll be fun.

168
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,120
Help me, help me.

169
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,720
No, I don't want to.

170
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:22,640
I don't want to.

171
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:23,680
I don't want to.

172
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:27,600
This is my gift to you!

173
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,360
You think you can just say no?

174
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,280
Mingzhe.

175
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,920
I was wrong. I'm sorry.

176
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,840
Please let me go. I was wrong.

177
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,160
I'm begging you.

178
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,360
I was wrong.

179
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,960
Look at yourself now.

180
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,320
Don't you look like me

181
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,160
when I was begging you before?

182
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:52,640
I begged you to help me back then,

183
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,360
even to send me to rehab.

184
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:55,560
But what did you do?

185
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,600
You disappeared.

186
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:00,520
You went abroad, scared of trouble.

187
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:03,920
You didn't care whether I lived or died.

188
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,080
Get up!

189
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,280
Get up!

190
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:09,600
Eat it!

191
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:10,960
Eat it!

192
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:14,160
- Share the joy and pain with me.
- No.

193
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:15,360
- Eat it!
- No!

194
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,520
We're best buddies, right?

195
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:17,760
- I was wrong.
- Eat it!

196
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:19,280
- I won't.
- Eat it!

197
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,480
Eat! Eat!

198
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,880
Come on, eat!

199
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,520
If you don't, I'll kill you.

200
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,600
Stay back! Stay back!

201
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,080
Li Mingzhe, calm down.

202
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:34,840
I'm Ye Zhen, captain
of the Hummer Commandos.

203
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,840
Tell us what you want.

204
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,800
I have a demand.

205
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:41,360
As long as he eats this thing,

206
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,280
I'll let him go.

207
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:43,560
Eat it! Eat it!

208
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:44,480
Li Mingzhe.

209
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,640
Isn't he your friend?

210
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,160
Why are you doing this?

211
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,600
Friend?

212
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:53,520
Come on, friend.

213
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:55,840
Tell this officer

214
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,720
what you did to me, friend.

215
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,360
Come on, say it.

216
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,720
I'll say it.

217
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,720
I lured him to drugs.

218
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,800
I was curious back then.

219
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:10,680
I wanted to see
what addiction looked like.

220
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,960
It's all my fault. I'm a monster.

221
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,760
- Li Mingzhe.
- Let me go.

222
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,120
He committed a crime.

223
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,600
Just hand him over to us.

224
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:19,560
He'll face justice under the law.

225
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:22,840
Justice?

226
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:26,720
Drug inducement, right?

227
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:27,800
How many years can he get?

228
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,080
He ruined my entire life!

229
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:29,920
Do you get that?

230
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:30,840
Yes.

231
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:31,880
I understand.

232
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,800
But just because he did wrong

233
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,920
doesn't justify your crime.

234
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:39,040
I don't want to hear your lectures!

235
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,440
- I don't want to hear!
- Okay.

236
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,560
Then here's the plain truth.

237
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:43,440
Committing a crime for someone like him

238
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:44,480
is not worth it.

239
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,720
Let him go now

240
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:47,800
and you might still
get a lighter sentence.

241
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:49,720
But if he dies,

242
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:51,800
your life is truly over.

243
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:58,840
My life?

244
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:01,600
My life is already over.

245
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,880
I'll take someone down with me.

246
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:04,800
Li Mingzhe!

247
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:09,320
Think about your parents.

248
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:12,680
They're so worried about you.

249
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,880
Do you want to hurt them too?

250
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,040
I've failed them.

251
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:25,840
Your dad is here.

252
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:26,840
He's outside.

253
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,040
Don't you want to see him?

254
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,640
They don't have a son like me.

255
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:37,640
I'm not their son.

256
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:40,600
Mingzhe.

257
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,520
You can't go in yet.

258
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:46,440
Mingzhe.

259
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,360
Captain.

260
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:54,720
Dad.

261
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:57,880
Mingzhe.

262
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:00,640
What happened?

263
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,040
Let him go.

264
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,400
Son.

265
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,560
Come home with me.

266
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,640
I can't go home anymore, Dad.

267
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:17,200
Yes, you can.

268
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:18,680
Mingzhe.

269
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:21,640
What you're doing is illegal.

270
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,440
I'm sorry, Dad.

271
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,720
I've let you down.

272
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,160
Mingzhe.

273
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,320
I'm not disappointed.

274
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,480
I'm not asking for anything now.

275
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:47,480
I just want you to be safe, son.

276
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:50,880
Come home

277
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,800
and we'll stay together as a family.

278
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:58,800
It's too late.

279
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,360
Too late now.

280
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:01,640
It's not too late.

281
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,240
If you let him go now,

282
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,440
we'll send you to rehab.

283
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:09,160
You can start over again.

284
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,320
Re-

285
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,240
Really?

286
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:19,360
Yes.

287
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,040
Absolutely.

288
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,440
Once you're clean,

289
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,640
you can return to your family

290
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,200
and all these painful things
will be behind you.

291
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,080
I wish

292
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,560
I could go back to

293
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,520
when I was a kid.

294
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:26,920
I'm sorry.

295
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:28,480
Dad.

296
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:32,840
Mingzhe.

297
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:34,200
Mingzhe.

298
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,040
Mingzhe!

299
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:38,800
Call an ambulance!

300
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:15,580
(Police, Binjiang)

301
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,760
Li Mingzhe was still so young.

302
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:24,120
I bet his father feels really guilty.

303
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,560
If only he hadn't

304
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:27,440
put so much pressure on him,

305
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:28,640
things didn't have to happen.

306
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,520
He just wanted his son to succeed.

307
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:37,120
But the ones who make and sell drugs

308
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,600
are truly heartless.

309
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:41,000
In this world,

310
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,520
nothing destroys a person

311
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:44,880
like drugs do.

312
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,360
But I still don't get it.

313
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52,360
Xu Junjie wasn't a drug dealer.

314
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:55,360
Why would he push Li Mingzhe
to try drugs?

315
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,800
He saw him as his best friend.

316
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,360
There's a saying, isn't there?

317
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,080
Never stare two things in the world,

318
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04,280
the sun

319
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:06,640
and the human heart.

320
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:43,680
I wish

321
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:46,080
so badly to go back

322
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,160
when I was a kid.

323
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,120
I'm sorry.

324
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:55,640
Dad.

325
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,000
Tang Xin.

326
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,160
Tang Xin.

327
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,080
What are you doing?

328
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,000
What's on your mind?

329
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:09,440
Captain.

330
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,520
Can I talk to you about something?

331
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,040
Get to the top first.

332
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:24,720
Tang Xin.

333
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:27,640
Captain.

334
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:28,760
What happened just now?

335
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:29,680
That was too risky.

336
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,040
Just now,

337
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:35,760
I zoned out. Sorry, Captain.

338
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,360
Danyang told me

339
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:49,560
that she hopes

340
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:50,800
I can share my stress

341
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,040
with my parents.

342
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,680
But I really don't know
how to tell them.

343
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,480
You feel like

344
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:02,040
your parents worked
so hard to raise you,

345
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:03,880
gave you the best they had,

346
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:06,040
and now you still want to tell them,

347
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:08,440
"I need to be understood, I need space,

348
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:10,160
I need to relax"

349
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:11,840
sounds ungrateful,

350
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:12,760
right?

351
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:16,840
Silly child.

352
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:18,440
You're overthinking it.

353
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,400
Mutual understanding is hard.

354
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:23,640
But if you constantly

355
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:26,320
silence your own needs

356
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,200
to please others,

357
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,400
this grievance will turn into pain.

358
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,040
Over time,even hatred.

359
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,280
And that will be harder to fix.

360
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:39,680
Trust me.

361
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:41,360
There is no parent

362
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,080
who doesn't want
their child to be happy.

363
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:48,040
Okay, Captain.

364
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,640
I know how to do now.

365
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:53,680
Go on.

366
00:17:58,520 --> 00:17:59,680
Take a shower first.

367
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:00,600
You smell terrible.

368
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:53,200
We're the police.

369
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,120
Don't move.

370
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:55,560
Come with us.

371
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:57,480
Go.

372
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:01,800
Drugs were found in the milk tea.

373
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,040
We're not wronging you, are we?

374
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:06,080
It's my first time.

375
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:07,720
I won't ever do that again.

376
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,400
Don't cry, it won't help.

377
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:13,360
Here's the deal.

378
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:15,480
You get one chance

379
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,200
to redeem yourself.

380
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:19,960
Can you do that?

381
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:21,240
I'll cooperate.

382
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:37,720
Don't move!

383
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,320
Freeze!

384
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:43,480
Police! Don't move!

385
00:20:07,550 --> 00:20:08,470
Xiong.

386
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,000
Xiong, I know I was wrong.

387
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:11,280
Please forgive me, Xiong.

388
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,880
I really know I was wrong, Xiong.

389
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,040
Useless trash.

390
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,680
The police already figured out
the supply routes.

391
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,360
How could you be so clueless?

392
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:20,800
Now,great job.

393
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:22,240
Our new hub

394
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:23,160
was just destroyed.

395
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:26,040
Xiong, I really didn't expect it.

396
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:27,600
Those addicts

397
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,240
actually dared to sell us out.

398
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,480
Do they know this place?

399
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,280
No, absolutely not.

400
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:38,080
I never told them about here.

401
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,480
Even if the police caught them,

402
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:40,520
there's no way

403
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:42,080
this place get exposed, Xiong.

404
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,280
The brain's a good thing.

405
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:46,400
You should try having one.

406
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:53,920
What can we do now?

407
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:55,720
I still have a few orders

408
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:56,840
waiting to be placed.

409
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:03,200
Tell them

410
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:04,920
to delay the deals.

411
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:08,440
We can't count on those addict mules.

412
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:10,480
We'll deliver them ourselves.

413
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:14,360
Alright, Xiong, I'll handle it now.

414
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:16,680
You're off this job.

415
00:21:20,370 --> 00:21:21,440
Xiong.

416
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:23,680
I really know I messed up.

417
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,520
Please give me another chance.

418
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:26,640
I swear

419
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,520
I won't screw up again this time.

420
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:32,280
You want one more chance?

421
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:33,850
If I give you,

422
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:35,320
the cops
might target me next.

423
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:37,520
Let me ask you.

424
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:40,200
Have you heard of Mad Dog?

425
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,160
That technician?

426
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,120
Yeah.

427
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:48,320
But I don't think he's in Binjiang.

428
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,200
And he's not easy to find.

429
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:54,720
Can't find him, huh?

430
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,200
No.

431
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:57,800
I can find him, totally!

432
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:59,280
Xiong, don't worry.

433
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:00,800
I'll get him for you.

434
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:04,400
But we don't have goods right now.

435
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,040
Even if we find him, is it too late?

436
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:19,080
I've already contacted Wu.

437
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:20,880
He's about to

438
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:22,680
receive a big shipment.

439
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,360
So you

440
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:26,280
don't worry about it.

441
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,120
Xiong, you're the real deal.

442
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:31,800
Get lost.

443
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:57,180
(Cheesy Pizza, Haohai Creative Park)

444
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:01,960
Still think you're young?

445
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:03,840
Keep pushing like this,

446
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:05,600
and you'll work yourself into the grave.

447
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:06,800
Alright.

448
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:08,520
Cut the nagging.

449
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:12,240
I just keep thinking about Yang Yang.

450
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:14,240
We didn't really help them much.

451
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:17,160
At least we should
send them some money, right?

452
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:18,360
Oh right,

453
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:19,680
just say the money

454
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:21,820
is from Xin.

455
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:25,040
Don't let those relatives

456
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:27,280
hold anything against her later.

457
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:32,360
These past days,

458
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:34,680
I've worked too much.

459
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:38,280
My back pain's coming back again.

460
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:45,040
Was I a little too harsh that day?

461
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:50,280
I've been thinking lately.

462
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,240
It's true that

463
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:54,720
I've been making things harder
for our girl.

464
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:56,520
What's face even worth?

465
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,240
What's the point of our life?

466
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,600
It's all for our daughter, isn't it?

467
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,280
If she does well,
that's better than anything.

468
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:04,680
Right?

469
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:10,680
These days,

470
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:12,680
I can't bring myself to say

471
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:14,680
to talk to Xin.

472
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,040
Why don't you help me?

473
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,280
Give me a face-saving way

474
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:20,640
and let's put this behind us.

475
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:24,600
I'm talking to you.

476
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:26,120
Why aren't you saying anything?

477
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:29,280
Be gentle.

478
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:32,840
Yeah, that's the right pressure.

479
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:37,840
How about

480
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:39,560
I tell her this?

481
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:41,520
Xin,

482
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:43,120
you're home?

483
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:44,880
No, no, no.

484
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,400
That's so dumb.

485
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:48,960
Xin.

486
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:50,680
What do you want to eat?

487
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:52,160
Dad will cook it for you.

488
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:53,760
No, no, no.

489
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,480
My cooking is terrible.

490
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:58,440
Xin always says my cooking

491
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:00,040
is either too salty or too sweet.

492
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:02,240
Forget it.

493
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,400
I'll just talk to Xin directly.

494
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:06,600
Xin.

495
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:07,720
That day,

496
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:10,120
it was all Dad's fault.

497
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:12,120
Don't take it to heart.

498
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:13,800
Forgive me.

499
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:16,720
I won't cause you trouble again, ever.

500
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:22,000
Dad.

501
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:28,920
Xin, you...

502
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:31,000
When did you come back?

503
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:32,720
I was wrong.

504
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,920
No, no, Xin, don't cry.

505
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:36,130
Honey!

506
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:37,960
Come here, quick! Look!

507
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:39,280
Xin is crying.

508
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:40,840
Don't cry, don't cry.

509
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:42,440
Dad, it's my fault.

510
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:43,520
Don't cry, don't cry.

511
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:45,040
I've been keeping everything

512
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:46,520
bottled up inside.

513
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:48,080
Xin.

514
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,640
Say whatever you want to say.

515
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:50,880
Why can't you talk to us?

516
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:51,720
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

517
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:53,120
Don't cry, don't cry.

518
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:55,520
Actually,

519
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:57,640
I'm really not

520
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:58,560
as good as you think.

521
00:25:58,840 --> 00:25:59,800
Everyone in our team

522
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:01,120
is better than me.

523
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:03,240
I have to work very hard

524
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:04,800
just to keep up with them.

525
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:06,240
I'm really not

526
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:07,400
as amazing as you think.

527
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:08,880
That's okay, Xin.

528
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:10,160
You'll only get better.

529
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:11,320
- Yes,yes.
- Not good enough.

530
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:12,640
You don't need to be the best.

531
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,160
Just be yourself.

532
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:16,120
I'll never be your pride.

533
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:20,720
I know

534
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:23,840
you've both sacrificed so much for me.

535
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:25,760
Dad.

536
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:28,440
You drive the night shift every day

537
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:30,320
all night long.

538
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,200
You barely sleep.

539
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:33,520
And Mom,

540
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,880
even when you're not feeling well,

541
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:37,920
every time I come back from the team,

542
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:39,560
you still insist on making soup for me.

543
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:40,480
Right?

544
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:43,960
I know

545
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:45,800
you do it all out of love.

546
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:48,280
You don't want me to struggle too much.

547
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:49,560
You want to help me.

548
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:50,800
But you know,

549
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:52,480
the more you do that,

550
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:53,640
the more pressure I feel.

551
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:56,040
There are things
I've wanted to tell you,

552
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:56,960
but I...

553
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:59,000
I was afraid you'd
be disappointed in me.

554
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,400
No, no. Don't cry, don't cry.

555
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,080
Don't feel pressure. Just talk to us.

556
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:03,960
You're our girl.
You can say anything to us.

557
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:04,880
Say it, say it.

558
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:06,440
About that matter,

559
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:07,920
it wasn't our fault.

560
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:09,560
It was Yang Yang and his mom.

561
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:11,480
He's reckless and she spoiled him.

562
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,600
Yang Yang's an adult now.

563
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:15,680
He should be responsible for his actions.

564
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:17,400
That's right. Our daughter's right.

565
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:19,000
Absolutely right.

566
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,280
Since we did nothing wrong,

567
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:21,640
we don't need to apologize,

568
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,520
and we don't need to compensate either.

569
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:25,320
You two shouldn't feel guilty either.

570
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:26,240
Okay, okay.

571
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:27,960
We won't.

572
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:28,880
And also,

573
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:30,920
Dad, don't drive

574
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:32,320
more than six hours.

575
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:34,120
It's too hard for your body, okay?

576
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:35,000
Okay, I promise.

577
00:27:35,010 --> 00:27:36,800
I'll drive five and a half hours only.

578
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:37,640
No, no, no.

579
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:39,280
Five hours and fifty minutes.

580
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:40,160
Our daughter's grown.

581
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,320
I won't go over six hours.

582
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:42,680
Mom.

583
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:45,080
If you're not feeling well,
stop pushing through.

584
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:46,200
Go to the hospital quickly.

585
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:48,640
- Alright.
- No more crying now.

586
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:49,560
One more thing.

587
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:52,320
I'll keep working hard,

588
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:53,880
working hard at my job.

589
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:55,880
But even if

590
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:58,040
I still can't be the best,

591
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:00,400
please don't be disappointed in me.

592
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:02,040
No, we won't be.

593
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:03,040
We already told you.

594
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:04,320
Just be your true self.

595
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:05,320
You'll do great.

596
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:06,720
You definitely will.

597
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:09,880
You're always our good girl.

598
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:12,640
Dad, Mom.

599
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:15,320
You're just like when you were little.

600
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:04,600
Han Ning.

601
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:06,640
You really let us down.

602
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:08,760
Ever since Guan Tingting

603
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:09,760
came into our house,

604
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,080
how many times has it been now?

605
00:29:11,270 --> 00:29:12,120
You've lost your mind.

606
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:13,240
For this little factory girl,

607
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:14,600
you've ignored your own parents.

608
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,480
Your dad and I have worked so hard,

609
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:18,840
never dared to rest or retire.

610
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:20,160
Han Ning.

611
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:22,360
I'm begging you.

612
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:24,040
Just ask her to leave.

613
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:25,880
It's not a discussion.
She must leave tonight.

614
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:42,040
Don't touch me.

615
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:04,760
Alright, alright, stop crying.

616
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:06,760
Do you not want your son anymore?

617
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:24,640
Does it hurt?

618
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:27,760
I was too slow.

619
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:29,480
I almost had it.

620
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:31,320
Don't do that again.

621
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:34,080
You care about me?

622
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:37,160
It's 100,000 yuan.

623
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:39,920
That's not something you can get
by pawning a phone or necklace.

624
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:41,480
Just leave me alone.

625
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:45,560
How about this?

626
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:47,520
I'll ask my mom to
transfer the car to my name.

627
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:48,840
Then we can sell it.

628
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:51,040
Enough.

629
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:52,360
They said if I don't

630
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:53,600
pay them back in three days,

631
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:55,840
they'll post my nudes online.

632
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:01,000
Don't worry.

633
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:02,720
I'll figure something out.

634
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:07,000
Stop asking your parents for money.

635
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:08,400
It's not easy for them.

636
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:11,560
They make money to spend on me.

637
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:14,480
Don't worry.

638
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:16,240
I'm their only son.

639
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,200
They're just worried about me.

640
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:19,200
As long as I'm alive,

641
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,640
they'll do anything I ask.

642
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:22,680
Enough, stop talking like that.

643
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:23,600
I don't want to hear.

644
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:26,160
Tingting.

645
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:28,080
In this world, other than you,

646
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:29,280
nothing else matters to me.

647
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:30,400
I'll do anything

648
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:31,760
you tell me to do.

649
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:35,280
Tingting.

650
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:36,640
What's wrong, Tingting?

651
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:38,280
Tingting?

652
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:40,080
Tingting?

653
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:42,280
What's going on?

654
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:27,560
Are you okay, Tingting?

655
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:31,000
What's wrong?

656
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:35,200
Do you love me?

657
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:41,480
What do you think?

658
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:44,120
Would you die for me?

659
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:48,800
Of course.

660
00:32:54,820 --> 00:32:59,700
(Policewoman's Mini-Class)

661
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:01,600
In realistic family life,

662
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:03,680
(Policewoman's Mini-Class)
parents like say this.

663
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:05,080
Some parents even use

664
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:06,200
self-punishment

665
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:07,360
to threaten their children,

666
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:09,880
making them feel guilty

667
00:33:10,130 --> 00:33:11,650
and obey out of pressure.

668
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:13,440
Please learn to express love properly.

669
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:15,520
Don't morally kidnap your children

670
00:33:15,530 --> 00:33:16,450
and give them pressure

671
00:33:16,450 --> 00:33:17,680
