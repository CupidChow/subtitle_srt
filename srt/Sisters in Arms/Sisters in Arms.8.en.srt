But your debt

00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,400
has all been cleared.

From now on,

no one will be able to trouble you.

29
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,280
Thank you, Han Ning.

30
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,080
I promised you

31
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,640
that I would protect you.

32
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:56,720
Silly.

33
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:00,920
But,

34
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,920
can you stop lying to me?

35
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,880
You won't get

36
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:11,880
that 100,000 yuan.

37
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,320
What do you mean?

38
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:17,000
That's the debt Guan Tingting owes.

39
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,080
You're the loan shark
who lent her money.

40
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:21,440
I'm not Guan Tingting's loan shark.

41
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,600
She owes drug money.

42
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,440
She's a drug addict.

43
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:32,000
A rotten drug addict.

44
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,800
If she finds someone
to deliver the drugs,

45
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,240
then her debt

46
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:39,880
is settled.

47
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,280
Didn't she tell you all this?

48
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,120
This does not concern you.

49
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,200
You've been tricked.

50
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,920
You really like her, don't you?

51
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:58,880
I'll go home and get
some clean clothes for you.

52
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:06,880
Rest early.

53
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,080
Come see me early tomorrow.

54
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:11,400
Okay?

55
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:25,440
You take a good rest.

56
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:59,060
(Ward)

57
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,800
You're still bullying me even at my state.

58
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,640
Does it hurt?

59
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:03,680
It hurts like hell.

60
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,680
Eat an apple.

61
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:05,600
It'll keep you safe.

62
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,280
Cut it into small pieces for me.

63
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,640
It's fine. I'll watch.

64
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:11,920
What do you understand?

65
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:14,970
You better peel the orange.

66
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:17,920
I'm fine.

67
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:18,840
Mr. Lin.

68
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,520
Why aren't you going in?

69
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:21,440
Ye.

70
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,400
Come in.

71
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,160
Mr. Lin is here.

72
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,720
- Mr. Lin.
- Hello, Mr. Lin.

73
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:27,640
Hello, Mr. Lin.

74
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:28,960
You're here too?

75
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:30,640
Dad.

76
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:32,880
You're hurt?

77
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,560
Did you break any bones?

78
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,480
It's fine. Just skin injuries.

79
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,880
Don't worry.

80
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,000
The doctor said it's fine.

81
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,080
She'll be out in a few days.

82
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,360
Why would I worry?

83
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,720
It's just a minor injury.

84
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,080
She didn't embarrass me.

85
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,280
Seems like she'll need more training.

86
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:57,880
Sweat more in normal times,

87
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,000
then you will bleed less in battle.

88
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:02,440
Right.

89
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,440
If you're okay, get discharged sooner.

90
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,720
Don't occupy the bed here.

91
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:11,960
I'm going back.

92
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,720
- Goodbye, Mr. Lin.
- Goodbye, Mr. Lin.

93
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:15,920
Goodbye.

94
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:20,600
What kind of father is this?

95
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,000
Don't occupy the bed here.

96
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:22,960
Bleed less in battle.

97
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,080
Is this enough?

98
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,680
Stop laughing at me.

99
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,200
Captain, we need extra practice.

100
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,840
Otherwise, you'll end up like me.

101
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,080
- Yes.
- I'm happy to stay in the hospital

102
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,160
for a few more days.

103
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,080
Guan Tingting.

104
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,360
Auntie.

105
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:52,440
Please let Han Ning go.

106
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:54,560
I beg you, I beg you.

107
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,180
What are you doing?

108
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:57,060
I beg you.

109
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:58,840
Auntie, please get up.

110
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,400
Auntie.

111
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,280
Here.

112
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:06,080
This is all the savings we have.

113
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,680
It's all for you.

114
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:09,440
Leave here.

115
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,320
I know

116
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:14,960
Han Ning only has you in his heart now.

117
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,800
He's almost gone mad for you.

118
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,240
But be honest with me,

119
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,480
do you really like him?

120
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:24,760
I...

121
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,760
If you don't like him,

122
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,800
please leave him.

123
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,520
He's only 20 years old.

124
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,680
If this continues,

125
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,880
he'll be ruined.

126
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,000
I beg you.

127
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,200
Please, have some pity on me.

128
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:41,760
I beg you.

129
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,760
Have some mercy on me.

130
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,200
Take it.

131
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:47,160
- Let him go.
- I'm sorry.

132
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,680
Sorry.

133
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,600
Please let him go, will you?

134
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,760
I beg you.

135
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:57,920
Auntie, please get up, okay?

136
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,520
I beg you, leave him.

137
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,720
Please leave him.

138
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,400
Stop.

139
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,760
The training is over for today.

140
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,680
There is still a physical gap

141
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:35,840
between men and women.

142
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,080
That's true.

143
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,160
But physical ability is just one part.

144
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,480
Comprehensive skills are more important.

145
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:49,240
Captain Song.

146
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:51,880
Let's see.

147
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,040
No more fighting.

148
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,200
You won.

149
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:04,160
Captain Song.

150
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,520
Next time, I'll try with you.

151
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:07,760
No more fighting.

152
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,640
Alright, alright, stop joking.

153
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,400
Hummer Commandos,

154
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,240
get ready for patrol.

155
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:15,480
- Yes.
- Yes.

156
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:17,800
Comprehensive skills.

157
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,920
- Are you okay?
- Are you okay?

158
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:37,810
Are you okay?

159
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:38,840
Are you okay?

160
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,280
I'm fine, I'm fine.

161
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:42,440
Stop him!

162
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,360
Don't run!

163
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,280
Tata, go around from there.

164
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,200
Let's go.

165
00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:49,920
Get out of the way.

166
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:55,360
Stop.

167
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,200
Why were you running?

168
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,600
I just realized something urgent.

169
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,400
I haven't done drugs.

170
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:07,280
We will know after
you take a urine test.

171
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:08,200
Take him away.

172
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,400
I...

173
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:10,720
I really haven't done drugs.

174
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:12,720
Han Ning.

175
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,840
The shumai or the porridge first?

176
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:15,960
And also salted duck eggs.

177
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,600
Has Tingting not come yet?

178
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:24,040
She left.

179
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:26,680
She left?

180
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,640
What do you mean, left?

181
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,400
Where did she go?

182
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:32,560
I don't know.

183
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:34,560
You don't know where she went?

184
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,720
She just left.

185
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:38,960
Eat your breakfast first.

186
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:39,920
Don't move.

187
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:41,880
Tell me, where did Guan Tingting go?

188
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,000
Tell me quickly.

189
00:10:43,530 --> 00:10:45,160
Han Ning, what are you doing?

190
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:46,280
Let go of her.

191
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:47,320
Let go.

192
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,400
Where's Guan Tingting?

193
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,160
Did you two give her a hard time again?

194
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:55,360
We didn't do anything to her.

195
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,040
She made the decision herself.

196
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,160
She said she was leaving Binjiang.

197
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:11,980
(Station Entrance, Ticket Office)

198
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:18,720
Hello.

199
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,400
Tingting, where are you?

200
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,360
I'm leaving Binjiang.

201
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:23,880
Why?

202
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,360
Where are you going? Tell me.

203
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,320
I'm sorry, Han Ning.

204
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:31,280
Come back to the hospital, okay?

205
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:32,640
Don't worry.

206
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:33,560
With me by your side,

207
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:35,640
no one can force you to leave.

208
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:38,040
No one's forcing me.

209
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,480
I'm sorry, Han Ning.

210
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,840
I've been using you all along.

211
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:45,760
I have to go.

212
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:47,200
Stop talking nonsense!

213
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:49,400
Did someone tell you to do this?

214
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,000
Well...

215
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:55,800
Sorry, Tingting.

216
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,560
Do you not like Binjiang?

217
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:58,800
If you don't like Binjiang,

218
00:11:58,800 --> 00:11:59,960
I'll leave with you.

219
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:01,080
We'll go wherever you want.

220
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,360
Let's go together, okay?

221
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,400
I'm sorry, Han Ning.

222
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:07,840
I'm really sorry.

223
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,280
I lied to you.

224
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,080
I never loved you.

225
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:17,200
I got close to you purely for money.

226
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:18,600
That's impossible.

227
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,440
You're not like that.

228
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,240
I'm sorry.

229
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:38,030
Sorry, the subscriber you dialed
is power off.

230
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:46,160
The subscriber you dialed is power off.

231
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:48,980
The subscriber you dialed is power off.

232
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,080
Get lost!

233
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,280
Captain Zhu.

234
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:27,200
What's going on?

235
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:28,680
The Hummer Commandos' handover.

236
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:30,360
Suspected illegal drug use.

237
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:32,480
Isn't this Sun Ping?

238
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,200
You know him?

239
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,280
We're old friends.

240
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:37,960
Mr. Zhu, long time no see.

241
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:41,200
Did you relapse after leaving the rehab?

242
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,440
I didn't, Mr. Zhu.

243
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:43,720
Although I've made mistakes,

244
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:45,600
you should allow me to reform, right?

245
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:47,720
Yes, reform.

246
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:50,080
How about this, take a urine test.

247
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,280
If everything's fine,

248
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:53,440
I'll apologize on their behalf.

249
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,360
Okay?

250
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:56,080
I don't have any urine.

251
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,040
Take your time.

252
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:58,640
Drink more water.

253
00:13:58,640 --> 00:13:59,640
Okay.

254
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:00,640
Go ahead.

255
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:01,560
Go.

256
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:12,780
(No Entering)

257
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:20,620
(Roof Area, No Entry Without Permission)

258
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:38,780
(Interrogation Room 2)

259
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,000
How's it going?

260
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:10,400
Don't hold it in.

261
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:11,640
Go do the urine test.

262
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,080
Still no urine now.

263
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:17,320
That's fine.

264
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:19,600
Take your time.
There's more water for you.

265
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:21,960
I can't drink anymore.

266
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:23,200
My stomach doesn't feel well.

267
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:25,800
Then go to the bathroom.

268
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,320
Mr. Zhu.

269
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:32,320
Don't stare me like that.

270
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,880
When I'm nervous, I can't pee.

271
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:36,200
Don't be nervous.
What are you nervous about?

272
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:38,520
Anyway,

273
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:40,120
if you don't do the urine test today,

274
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:41,200
you're not going home.

275
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:43,040
We'll wait.

276
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:51,880
How about I make you some hot tea?

277
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:55,520
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

278
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:56,940
I need to go to the bathroom.

279
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:57,860
(Police)

280
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,160
What's wrong?

281
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:13,140
(Hummer Commandos)

282
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:22,760
Han Ning.

283
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:24,560
Don't come closer.

284
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:26,040
I told you not to come closer!

285
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:27,160
Stay back, don't come closer!

286
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:28,680
Han Ning.

287
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:32,360
I'll agree to whatever you want.

288
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:34,320
Come down, okay?

289
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:37,040
I want Guan Tingting.

290
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:39,640
We really don't know where she is.

291
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:44,560
Han Ning.

292
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:47,360
If she doesn't come here

293
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:48,520
in 30 minutes,

294
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,080
I'll jump down.

295
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:51,920
Command Center.

296
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:53,720
There's a jumper at the Third Hospital.

297
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:55,760
We're going to check the situation now.

298
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:57,680
Please get the fire brigade here

299
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:58,840
to help.

300
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:07,440
Han Ning.

301
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:10,480
Can you stop calling me Han Ning?

302
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,280
I really hate that name now.

303
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,680
Which Han Ning are you thinking of?

304
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:16,480
If you call me Han Ning again,

305
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:17,920
I'll jump down right now.

306
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:19,280
Don't get too worked up.

307
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:24,400
Captain.

308
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:25,840
Why does Han Ning react like this

309
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:27,560
when his mom calls his name?

310
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:30,040
There's definitely something wrong.

311
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:33,720
Ma'am.

312
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:36,120
We need to know more about

313
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:37,240
Han Ning's situation.

314
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,920
Does he have any signs of depression?

315
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,360
Yes.

316
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:43,840
When school started last year,

317
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:45,320
severe depression was confirmed.

318
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:47,440
Later, something extreme happened.

319
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,120
He's in serious condition.

320
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:50,880
In his life,

321
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,520
has he encountered anything difficult?

322
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:55,760
I don't feel anything.

323
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:58,080
May I ask,

324
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,560
both his biological parents?

325
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:00,520
Of course.

326
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:03,560
I gave birth to him

327
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:05,400
at an advanced age.

328
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,080
I'm sorry.

329
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,680
If only his brother were here.

330
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:11,400
His real brother?

331
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:15,520
He was six at the time.

332
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:28,200
While swimming,

333
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:29,880
an accident happened.

334
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:32,840
After the child passed away,

335
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:35,160
we had another son

336
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,000
ten years after.

337
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:42,400
It was Heaven's mercy on us,

338
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:45,720
giving us another son.

339
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:50,000
He returned to us in Han Ning's place.

340
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:52,600
Officer,

341
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,880
we cannot lose this son again.

342
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,440
Please save him.

343
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:57,520
- Okay.
- Save him.

344
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:58,440
Don't be agitated.

345
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,000
So Han Ning's older brother

346
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:03,640
was also named Han Ning?

347
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,040
Yes, his name was Han Ning.

348
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:10,240
To remember our eldest son,

349
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:11,640
we named Han Ning

350
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:12,800
after him,

351
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,200
pretending he

352
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,160
has never left us.

353
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:25,760
Han Ning.

354
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:27,040
Do you remember me?

355
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:29,520
We just met a few days ago.

356
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:31,520
If you have anything,

357
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,160
you can talk to me.

358
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,240
You have 20 minutes left.

359
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,880
If you've made up your mind,

360
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:39,880
you wouldn't set a time limit.

361
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,600
You definitely still have a request.

362
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:44,160
I only hope you can bring

363
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:46,320
Guan Tingting in front of me.
Can you do that?

364
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,240
I also want to find
Guan Tingting for you.

365
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,680
But her phone is really off.

366
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:51,440
I can't find her.

367
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,400
Tang Xin, Tata,

368
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,320
go find Guan Tingting.

369
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:55,040
Yes.

370
00:19:55,500 --> 00:20:01,420
(Binjiang Fire Brigade)

371
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:08,120
I'm from the Special Patrol Police Team.

372
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:09,200
My name is Ye Zhen.

373
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,080
So, you're an expert negotiator?

374
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:15,640
There's no negotiation here.

375
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,280
I just want to ensure your safety.

376
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,160
Do you know

377
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,720
that the world I see

378
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:27,200
is completely different
from the one you see?

379
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:28,640
Okay.

380
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,040
Then we won't talk about that.

381
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,480
Let's talk about your girlfriend,

382
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:34,120
Guan Tingting.

383
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:35,600
Okay?

384
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:45,200
Tingting.

385
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:47,120
Besides you, I don't care about

386
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,360
anything else in this world.

387
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:50,800
As long as you say it, I'll do anything.

388
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:53,840
Can you give me a few more days?

389
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:56,280
Please, don't tell my family.

390
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:58,480
I will find a way to pay you back.

391
00:20:59,050 --> 00:21:00,290
Hello? Hello?

392
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:16,840
Excuse me.

393
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:19,360
Excuse me.

394
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:22,720
Do you have any money?

395
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:24,800
I need some money.

396
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:26,840
I'm really in a rush.

397
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:30,080
If you have money,

398
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,120
I can be with you.

399
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:53,600
Do you have a phone?

400
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,160
I still have some on WeChat Pay.

401
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:57,480
I'll transfer it all to you.

402
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,080
Leave now.

403
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:24,560
Don't do this.

404
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:27,560
If you think the money is not enough,

405
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:29,800
I'll find another way for you.

406
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:31,720
Thank you.

407
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:34,080
Really, thank you.

408
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:36,520
Thank you.

409
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:39,640
What?

410
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:40,520
Who are you?

411
00:22:40,530 --> 00:22:41,520
Guan Tingting.

412
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:43,440
What?

413
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,720
The debt isn't cleared yet,

414
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:46,960
and you want to run away?

415
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:48,800
It's you.

416
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:49,720
You recognized me?

417
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:51,480
Pay me back.

418
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:53,160
I don't have money.

419
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:56,240
Don't rush.

420
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,160
There are many ways

421
00:22:58,360 --> 00:22:59,520
for you to pay me back.

422
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:03,320
Wasn't our debt settled?

423
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:04,760
Who said it was settled?

424
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,720
That guy said once
we gave him the goods,

425
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,120
it would be settled.

426
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:09,200
Then tell me,

427
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:11,080
where did that guy say he went?

428
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:12,720
I don't know. Not my business.

429
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:13,680
Go.

430
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:14,720
- Let me go.
- Go.

431
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:15,880
What are you doing?

432
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:21,800
Nothing, I accidentally bumped into him.

433
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,000
Sorry about that.

434
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:24,320
I'm not hurt.

435
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,120
Are you okay?

436
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:27,520
I'm fine.

437
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:28,440
Alright.

438
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,920
Captain, Guan Tingting's train

439
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:37,480
is departing in ten minutes.

440
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:39,600
The station system shows
no record of her entry.

441
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:41,760
Head to the train station quickly.

442
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,080
Stay in contact with me.

443
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:44,360
Got it.

444
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:47,640
How did you two meet?

445
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:50,200
Don't think I don't know
you're stalling.

446
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:52,600
You have five minutes left.

447
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:54,960
We've found the train she'd take.

448
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,200
But she's not on it.

449
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:57,760
We can't bring her here

450
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,000
in only five minutes.

451
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,720
Instead of wasting time on me here,

452
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,560
why don't you go find her yourself?

453
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:04,280
Stop lying to me.

454
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:05,200
Young man,

455
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:07,280
if you give us time,

456
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:09,600
you're giving yourself time as well.

457
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:10,600
I've given it.

458
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:15,600
I even gave them 20 years.

459
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:28,980
(Integrated Police Communication System)

460
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:30,640
I've found Guan Tingting.

461
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:32,280
She was seen on surveillance footage

462
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:34,000
on Anyuan Road,
west of the train station.

463
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:35,400
Chase her.

464
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:38,780
(Police)

465
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:40,780
(Rescue)

466
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:43,440
Look here.

467
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,600
Come, look.

468
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,560
No one cared about me before.

469
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:49,440
Now that I'm about to die,

470
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,040
everyone's here to see me.

471
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:53,600
Don't get agitated.

472
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,720
We've already found Guan Tingting.

473
00:24:58,280 --> 00:24:59,200
Stop lying to me.

474
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:00,480
She won't come.

475
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:03,720
Don't be impulsive.

476
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:07,760
Sorry, everyone.

477
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:09,500
(Rescue)

478
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:10,960
Sorry for making you wait.

479
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:12,640
Captain, we've got Guan Tingting.

480
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:13,880
Quick, connect the video call.

481
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:15,360
Let Guan Tingting speak.

482
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:20,760
I'll jump down and find you now.

483
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:21,920
Look.

484
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:23,800
Guan Tingting is here.

485
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:25,200
Han Ning, I'm coming.

486
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,160
Wait for me.

487
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:28,600
Tingting.

488
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:34,800
Captain Zhu.

489
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:35,920
We've got a lead.

490
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,760
We've retraced the actions

491
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:39,800
from before

492
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:42,040
and interviewed nearby residents.

493
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:43,360
We've made new discoveries.

494
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:44,750
Take a look.

495
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:51,600
(Integrated Police Communication System)
During the arrest,

496
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:53,960
there was no suitcase in the car.

497
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:56,600
This means the suitcase

498
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,160
might be the big shipment
that Wu is waiting for.

499
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:02,840
By the way,

500
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:05,400
Han Ning's girlfriend, Guan Tingting,

501
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:07,280
has worked in several factories,

502
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:08,640
often skipping and changing jobs.

503
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:11,160
And she borrowed a lot of money
from coworkers.

504
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:12,320
In the end, she got sued.

505
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:16,320
Go to the hospital.

506
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:19,160
Over here.

507
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,020
- Han Ning.
- Captain.

508
00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:20,930
Captain.

509
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:21,840
Quick!

510
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:23,320
- Han Ning.
- Tingting.

511
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:24,240
Han Ning.

512
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:26,120
Come here, it's dangerous.

513
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:27,600
Tell me first, Tingting.

514
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:30,400
Everything you told me was a lie,

515
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,320
right?

516
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:35,080
Yes, I was lying to you.

517
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:36,680
Come over quickly. Don't scare me.

518
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:39,360
Do you really love me?

519
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:40,720
Of course.

520
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:44,640
I want you to say it clearly, loudly.

521
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:52,440
I love you.

522
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:55,600
Okay.

523
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:56,760
I believe you.

524
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:58,440
Come, let's hug.

525
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:01,560
Han Ning.

526
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:03,120
Guan Tingting is already here.

527
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:04,880
Come here to talk to her.

528
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:22,160
You can talk about

529
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:23,640
other matters slowly in the ward.

530
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:26,080
Let's go.

531
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:29,320
Watch out.

532
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:31,000
Be careful, be careful.

533
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:32,440
Help them, quickly.

534
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,440
Danyang, my bag.

535
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:37,520
Now I know why he went to extremes.

536
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:38,960
He''s a bit pitiful.

537
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:41,400
To his parents,

538
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:43,880
he is just a replacement
for his brother.

539
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:45,320
So no matter how good

540
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:46,960
his parents are to him, it doesn't work.

541
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:48,520
He only feels

542
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:51,120
that they did all this
because his brother died.

543
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:52,520
Only Guan Tingting

544
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:54,000
can let him be himself.

545
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:56,680
No wonder he is addicted to Guan Tingting.

546
00:27:58,680 --> 00:27:59,600
Giving

547
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:01,960
allows him to feel his own existence.

548
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,400
Once the person he gives to disappears,

549
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:06,320
he feels his existence

550
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:07,440
is meaningless.

551
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:11,640
Let's go.

552
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,280
Thank you.

553
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:18,120
Thank you for saving Han Ning.

554
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:20,960
You're welcome. It's what we should do.

555
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:22,120
I'm really appreciated.

556
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:23,040
But

557
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:25,000
I still want to suggest you

558
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:26,920
communicate more with your child

559
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:28,840
and learn what he really wants.

560
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,440
He doesn't talk to us.

561
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,640
I feel sorry for his brother.

562
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,640
But I don't think I've treated him badly.

563
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:39,800
It's all because of that girl.

564
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:41,880
Thank you, officer.

565
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:44,040
We'll definitely talk with him.

566
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:46,400
Okay.

567
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:47,960
Now, you two stay here.

568
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:49,360
We need to go on a mission.

569
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:51,120
Okay, thank you.

570
00:28:51,130 --> 00:28:52,030
Let's go.

571
00:28:53,770 --> 00:28:54,640
Thank you.

572
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:55,600
Thank you so much.

573
00:28:59,040 --> 00:28:59,960
We're leaving.

574
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:00,930
- Bye.
- Thank you.

575
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:05,840
You go first.

576
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:16,600
Tingting.

577
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:17,800
What's wrong?

578
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:20,440
Tingting.

579
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:21,880
Tell me, what's wrong?

580
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:28,320
Do you not love me?

581
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:33,280
Speak, Tingting.

582
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:35,560
Say something. Do you not love me?

583
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:36,600
Let go of me.

584
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:38,120
You're hurting me.

585
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:39,960
I won't let go of you.

586
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:42,600
Wherever I go, you go with me.

587
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:45,700
(Third People's Hospital of Binjiang)

588
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:46,880
Han Ning!

589
00:29:47,710 --> 00:29:48,960
(Third People's Hospital of Binjiang)

590
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:56,040
Danyang, the rope.

591
00:30:07,420 --> 00:30:09,820
(Third People's Hospital of Binjiang)

592
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:20,360
Don't come closer.

593
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:21,920
If you come closer, I'll jump.

594
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:24,600
Don't move. Don't move.

595
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:30,240
Captain, be careful.

596
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:35,590
- Don't come down.
- Pull me up.

597
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:38,000
If you do, I'll bring them both
down with me.

598
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:40,840
Wait, wait.

599
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:43,000
Come up first. Come up first.

600
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:44,840
The frame can't hold you anymore.

601
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:46,600
Don't come down!

602
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:48,640
I'll calm his emotions.

603
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:51,480
Save me, save me.

604
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:53,280
Don't move.

605
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:56,480
Han Ning, don't move. I beg you.

606
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:57,880
Don't be afraid, Tingting.

607
00:30:58,600 --> 00:30:59,640
I'm with you.

608
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:03,360
Han Ning, don't shake it anymore.

609
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:05,080
Tingting is very scared.

610
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:08,720
Isn't she the one you love the most?

611
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:10,240
It used to be her.

612
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:14,480
I have no strength left.

613
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:15,800
Since you love her so much,

614
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:18,240
why are you doing this to her?

615
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:20,640
She will die, you know?

616
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:22,240
It's not death.

617
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:24,360
It's a love suicide.

618
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:26,280
No, save me. Pull me up.

619
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:27,560
I beg you.

620
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:29,480
Don't move, Han Ning.

621
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,800
Han Ning.

622
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:42,000
Han Ning, come over and help.

623
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:43,840
Help!

624
00:31:43,850 --> 00:31:45,200
Help!

625
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:13,600
Don't come over.

626
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:15,760
Don't move, don't move.

627
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:16,760
I beg you.

628
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:18,240
- Don't move.
- Don't move.

629
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,720
Tingting, come die with me.

630
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:23,080
Then we will never be apart.

631
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:26,000
Have I been bad to you?

632
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:27,680
No.

633
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:29,360
So good that I can't repay you.

634
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:31,400
I've never asked for anything in return.

635
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:33,240
Do you remember

636
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:34,160
the first time we met?

637
00:32:34,290 --> 00:32:35,140
I remember.

638
00:32:35,150 --> 00:32:36,960
When I was at my lowest
and no one helped,

639
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:38,200
you saved me.

640
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:39,840
On the contrary,

641
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:41,080
that day,

642
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:43,400
I was about to end my life.

643
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:45,640
But you saved me.

644
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:47,420
(DDVP)

645
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:52,640
Excuse me.

646
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:54,880
Excuse me.

647
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:57,800
Do you have money?

648
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:06,120
Don't do this.

649
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:08,560
Thank you.

650
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:11,080
Really, thank you.

651
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:13,280
Thank you so much.

652
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:21,800
(DDVP)
I'd never felt so important before.

653
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:24,560
When you held me tight and cried,

654
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:26,440
I didn't want to die anymore.

655
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:28,200
I felt like I came back to life.

656
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:30,680
I thought I'd just transfer

657
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:31,880
all the money to you.

658
00:33:33,020 --> 00:33:34,840
But seeing how much
you need to be protected,

659
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,240
how much you need me,

660
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:39,000
I suddenly found a reason to live.

661
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:41,960
So, you lived to protect me?

662
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:44,960
Can't you feel it?

663
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:47,040
I'm sorry.

664
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:49,360
I've been too greedy.

665
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,440
I've been using you.

666
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:53,560
I'm sorry.

667
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:56,440
I'm sorry. Let me go.

668
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:57,360
I don't blame you.

669
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:59,760
It's all my own wishful thinking.

670
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:01,800
I thought I could save you

671
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:03,240
from hell to heaven.

672
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:05,400
I was supposed to save my parents first,

673
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:06,320
then come to save you.

674
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,040
That's my value, right?

675
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,160
Seems like I thought too much.

676
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:15,160
I'm not so important after all.

677
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:17,000
To you,

678
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:18,640
I'm probably just

679
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:20,240
a soulless body.

680
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:21,720
Han Ning.

681
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:24,000
I understand why
Guan Tingting attracted you.

682
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:27,280
Because you've been living

683
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:30,400
under the shadow of the name Han Ning.

684
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:32,720
You hated this kind of life.

685
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:36,160
But when Guan Tingting appeared,

686
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:39,440
no matter what you said or did,

687
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:41,560
it didn't represent anyone.

688
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,440
You only represented yourself.

689
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,520
I don't even know who I am.

690
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:53,120
In this world, other than me,

691
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:54,800
no one can protect you anymore.

692
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:57,600
I can't leave you here alone.

693
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:00,800
I still have my mom and dad.

694
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:03,040
What will happen to them if I'm gone?

695
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:05,080
You're thinking too much.

696
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,440
They don't care at all.

697
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:09,960
All parents expect something in return.

698
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:13,000
It's not like you said.

699
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:14,280
In our place,

700
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:16,520
where boys are so favored,

701
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:18,800
they only had me.

702
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:22,480
They saved the best food
and things for me.

703
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:25,560
They never let me do hard labor,

704
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:27,120
and asked me to focus on studying.

705
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:29,000
They trusted me completely.

706
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:30,720
That's only because

707
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:32,120
your parents didn't make money.

708
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:33,000
If they had money,

709
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,120
they'd have had another kid.

710
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:34,980
Then

711
00:35:34,990 --> 00:35:36,320
you could make any mistakes.

712
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:38,000
Because there's a backup.

713
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:39,480
Han Ning.

714
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:42,440
I think you're a good person.

715
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:45,480
But you're unfair to your parents.

716
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:46,400
Fair?

717
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:48,120
What's fair?

718
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:49,680
Using my life to save my brother,

719
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:50,600
is that fair?

720
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:51,920
Should I thank them for that?

721
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:52,800
For watching me

722
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,200
but thinking about another Han Ning?

723
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:56,520
Is that fair?

724
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:58,800
No.

725
00:35:58,860 --> 00:36:03,700
(Policewoman's Mini-Class)

726
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:06,620
When incidents like jumping
or suicide attempts happen,

727
00:36:06,620 --> 00:36:08,940
(Policewoman's Mini-Class)
the crowd egg them on and cheer.

728
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:12,020
If this provokes someone to attempt suicide,

729
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:13,580
it could be considered

730
00:36:13,580 --> 00:36:15,700
a public order offense
of provoking trouble.

731
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:17,660
They will bear legal responsibility.

732
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:18,940
One careless remark

733
00:36:19,060 --> 00:36:21,860
