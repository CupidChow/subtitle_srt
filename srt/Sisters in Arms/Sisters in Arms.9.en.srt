(Police of the PRC)

Where is Han Ning?

00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:44,880
Han Ning!

00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,880
If you die,

28
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:50,040
I won't live either.

29
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:51,800
Ma'am,

30
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:53,200
please calm down first.

31
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,080
Do you really care about your son?

32
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:57,480
Of course, I care.

33
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:02,080
I would do anything for him.

34
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,320
Think carefully.

35
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:07,880
Which Han Ning
do you actually care about?

36
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:13,160
I know you treat your younger son well,

37
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,080
but what drives you to do this is

38
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,880
guilt over your eldest son

39
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,640
or your genuine love for him?

40
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,520
What are you talking about?

41
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,720
If he jumps off today,

42
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:27,120
could you just create another Han Ning

43
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,440
to continue his life?

44
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,360
Nonsense.

45
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:31,560
How could you think that?

46
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,760
It's not important what I think, Ma'am.

47
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:36,880
What's important is how Han Ning feels.

48
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,520
If over the years,

49
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,640
you had listened to him carefully,

50
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,960
you would know that Han Ning

51
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,080
has always felt this way.

52
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,920
The reason he's suffering

53
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,400
is because

54
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,320
you've never understood him.

55
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,840
Officer.

56
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,080
Officer.

57
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,520
- Sir, sir.
- Please save him.

58
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,560
Please get up first.

59
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,920
Actually, you can save Han Ning.

60
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,040
But first,

61
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:19,000
you must forget about
the Han Ning who died.

62
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,440
Let's prepare for the rope rescue

63
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,600
and wait for Captain's signal.

64
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,520
We can go anytime.

65
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,280
Is there still time?

66
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:30,680
I trust Captain.

67
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,040
I've always been excellent,

68
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:33,920
and very well-behaved.

69
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,440
I always please them.

70
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,920
I'm even more likeable
than that Han Ning.

71
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,480
But,

72
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:40,920
my mom actually guided me

73
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,360
to imitate his likes,

74
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,880
and the things he likes to eat.

75
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:45,400
I know that Han Ning's favorite food

76
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,000
even better than my own.

77
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:49,040
My dad always put toys

78
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:49,960
in my room,

79
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,760
telling me to like this and like that.

80
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:52,840
Then where was I?

81
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,240
Who am I really?

82
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:57,360
Han Ning,

83
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:59,120
it's not that they don't love you.

84
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,040
Maybe,

85
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:01,520
they just can't

86
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,440
get over the pain of losing their son.

87
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:04,480
So, should I live in

88
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,240
their guilt?

89
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:10,440
This world has never cared about us.

90
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:12,560
No one has ever cared about us.

91
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,520
This world can't accommodate us.

92
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,040
Die with me.

93
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:16,960
No.

94
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,200
- No, no, no.
- Don't be afraid.

95
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,320
I don't want to die.

96
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,680
Captain, there's a video here.

97
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,360
It's about Guan Tingting's father.

98
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,320
I've sent it over.

99
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:27,360
Han Ning.

100
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:29,400
Let me show you a video.

101
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,120
I beg you.

102
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,120
- Don't hurt my child.
- Dad.

103
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,200
Please.

104
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,320
Dad.

105
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,200
Don't hurt my child.

106
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,760
Dad, save me.

107
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:45,320
- Dad, no.
- Please.

108
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,680
Look.

109
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:50,080
Tingting's father loves her so much.

110
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,320
No parents don't love their children.

111
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,680
You don't understand

112
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,360
how much it hurts a parent

113
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,880
to lose a child.

114
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,000
Ma'am.

115
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,720
Son.

116
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:14,080
Son, I was wrong.

117
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:19,520
We shouldn't have let you live
as a replacement for him for 20 years.

118
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,040
I ignored you.

119
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:24,400
We didn't consider your feelings.

120
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,000
I know I was wrong.

121
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:30,720
Give me a chance.

122
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:32,920
Stay alive.

123
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:36,440
Okay?

124
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:39,520
Stay alive.

125
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,480
My child,

126
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,760
no matter what your name is,

127
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,760
you are who you are.

128
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:51,240
You are my one and only child.

129
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:54,760
Since the day you were born,

130
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:57,760
we swore to protect you no matter what.

131
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:00,040
But we never imagined

132
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,760
that in the end,
the ones who hurt you most

133
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,960
would be us.

134
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:08,720
Son,

135
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,280
I'm sorry.

136
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,080
Stay alive.

137
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,040
Son,

138
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,400
you have to live on.

139
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,240
We can't live without you.

140
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:38,300
(Binjiang)

141
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:41,680
Move.

142
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:47,420
(Authorized Personnel Only)

143
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,960
- Captain.
- Captain, how is it?

144
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:50,880
How are you?

145
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:51,840
Captain, what did doctor say?

146
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,200
Captain, is it still painful?

147
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:55,480
Don't disturb her.

148
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:57,080
I'm fine, just a minor injury.

149
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,880
Captain Zhu is with Han Ning now.

150
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,360
Alright, Mom, stop crying.

151
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,680
Don't worry.

152
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,920
I won't do anything foolish again.

153
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:21,720
Sir, Ma'am.

154
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,320
We'd like to talk to them alone.

155
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:26,720
Could you give us some privacy?

156
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,280
Don't worry.

157
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:31,200
Um…

158
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:33,840
Dad,

159
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,720
Mom,

160
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,120
I'm sorry.

161
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,040
Don't say that.

162
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,480
Forget it.

163
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,440
I won't say it again.

164
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:03,760
Officer,

165
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:08,360
I'd like to speak
with my girlfriend alone.

166
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:09,920
Don't worry.

167
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,520
We'll tell you everything

168
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,160
about what happened before.

169
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,120
Of course. That's fine.

170
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:19,720
Take your time.

171
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,160
Thank you.

172
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:27,100
(Ward)

173
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,560
Keep an eye on them.

174
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:30,520
Once they're done talking,

175
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,800
text me.

176
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:33,720
Got it.

177
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:34,840
Don't lose sight.

178
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:35,760
Sure.

179
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:43,080
Tingting,

180
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,160
I know you've always hated me.

181
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,560
I hate myself too.

182
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:54,120
I always complain about life

183
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,960
and find fault with everything.

184
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,560
It's just because of

185
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,680
my weak character.

186
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,920
I was too afraid to face reality.

187
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:08,280
I know

188
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,920
you've been lying to me.

189
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:15,120
You never loved me.

190
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,240
I didn't dare ask you

191
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,480
or blame you.

192
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,360
I was just afraid you'd leave me.

193
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,640
This time, we didn't die.

194
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,480
There will be more challenges ahead.

195
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:38,880
We're only 20.

196
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,120
Let's treat it like we've been reborn.

197
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:47,680
I want to start fresh
and live with dignity.

198
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:51,720
What do you think?

199
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,080
Captain, Dajun said

200
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,680
Han Ning might've been the one

201
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:26,000
who made the delivery that day.

202
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,560
Also, Guan Tingting's
urine test is positive.

203
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,640
I can pretty much guess

204
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,520
what the outcome is going to be.

205
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,200
They're still so young.

206
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:36,760
Yeah.

207
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:38,280
So young, yet already made mistakes.

208
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,640
But if you look at it another way,

209
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:43,360
being young means they still
have a chance to turn things around.

210
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:50,320
Captain Zhu's here.

211
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:54,840
Let's go.

212
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:55,800
Come on, let's go.

213
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,480
Captain, we're leaving.

214
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:58,400
Bye, see you.

215
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:04,320
What did the doctor say?

216
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,520
I'm fine.

217
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,120
Does it hurt?

218
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:08,560
No.

219
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,200
Dislocation must be agony.

220
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,120
How can you not feel?

221
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,000
Come on.

222
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,840
We get hurt during training all the time.

223
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,480
Are you sure you're okay?

224
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:18,400
I'm sure.

225
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,080
I was so scared.

226
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,120
How's Han Ning?

227
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,240
He's doing great.

228
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:26,480
Great?

229
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:28,160
We didn't even ask yet.

230
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,120
He turned himself in voluntarily.

231
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,120
Let's go. Take it easy.

232
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:40,680
Have some fruit.

233
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:47,440
Alright.

234
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,440
You rest,

235
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:51,040
and I'll do housework.

236
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:02,520
Here you are.

237
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:04,240
Be careful.

238
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:07,440
Good job, Comrade Zhu.

239
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,360
Thank you.

240
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,480
I'm serving the people.

241
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:13,680
You know what?

242
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:16,520
That Han Ning is really brave.

243
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:18,480
He actually turned himself in.

244
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,440
That's why

245
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:23,440
people are really complicated.

246
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:26,160
Honestly, Han Ning is still immature.

247
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:29,440
But I believe after this,

248
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:31,480
his attitude toward life will change.

249
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:32,880
Yeah.

250
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,040
The problem is

251
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:37,440
his parents

252
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,440
must be so heartbroken.

253
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,400
Luckily, they already talked it out.

254
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,120
Han Ning finally let go of his pain.

255
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:45,920
I think

256
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:46,760
this time, his parents

257
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:48,160
have truly moved on.

258
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:49,960
As long as they can let go,

259
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,680
they'll be able to face
the real Han Ning.

260
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:13,000
When will you

261
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:15,800
be able to let go?

262
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:34,600
I'm tired.

263
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:35,560
No, no, no.

264
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:36,560
I talked too much.

265
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,360
My EQ is low.

266
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:39,250
I said the wrong thing.

267
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:40,840
No, I'm just tired.

268
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:42,080
I'm going to rest.

269
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:04,400
Happy birthday

270
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:09,440
to you.

271
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:15,200
Happy birthday to you.

272
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:29,960
Happy birthday to you.

273
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,920
Happy birthday!

274
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:33,840
Make a wish.

275
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:35,320
Put it aside.

276
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:38,240
Okay, done?

277
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,600
- Done.
- Let's blow it out.

278
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,480
Okay.

279
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,400
Three, two, one.

280
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:48,520
That won't do!

281
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:49,560
- Put more effort!
- Yeah!

282
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:50,510
- Again!
- Blow harder!

283
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,480
If you can't blow it out,

284
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:56,920
your wish won't come true.

285
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:57,920
Come on, come on!

286
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:05,520
Try harder, blow!

287
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:09,680
You didn't eat?

288
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,880
You need extra training.

289
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,720
Wait, you...

290
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:16,520
Are you messing with me?

291
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:17,560
Mai Xiaoling!

292
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:19,400
It's not me, it's not me!

293
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:21,240
It's Wanru. It's her!

294
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:22,480
- You...
- Not me!

295
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:23,880
You're setting me up, huh?

296
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:25,240
Tang Xin said

297
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:27,440
she wanted to give you
a unique birthday.

298
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,240
You've turned bad.

299
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:30,760
You've turned bad.

300
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:32,120
No, not me!

301
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,400
What are you doing?

302
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,320
You wasteful woman!

303
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,280
You bought a handbag
worth tens of thousands!

304
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:40,040
Did you ever consider how I feel?

305
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:41,840
You think it's easy for me
to make money?

306
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,440
Your earnings are obviously my allowance!

307
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,280
You hear me?

308
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:45,450
- So loud.
- Buying a bag, so what?

309
00:15:45,450 --> 00:15:47,000
- My new neighbor.
- Tall,educated.

310
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,360
- Constantly fighting.
- Name one thing I'm worse at.

311
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:51,000
- You're lucky to have me!
- Why?

312
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,970
- That man is abusive.
- You should be thankful.

313
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,760
Listen, I don't care about you.

314
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:56,160
I'm buying another bag!

315
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,080
I dare you!

316
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:58,640
Stop right there!

317
00:15:58,780 --> 00:15:59,640
You stop!

318
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:01,200
Something's wrong. Let's go check.

319
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,760
Come on, let's go.

320
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,480
Where are you going?

321
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,060
How many more bags do you want?

322
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,520
Come home with me. Go.

323
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:08,520
Let go of her.

324
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:10,160
Who are you?

325
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,680
I'm telling you, mind your own business.

326
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,240
How embarrassing.

327
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,120
Come back with me. Go.

328
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:17,040
I'm not going back. I won't.

329
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:19,400
You've got some guts now.

330
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,680
Is your nose bleeding? Does it hurt?

331
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:32,800
Blood!

332
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:33,800
It hurts!

333
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:34,800
Is my nasal bone broken?

334
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,400
Who told you to hit him?

335
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,440
It's just a joke.

336
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,640
You shouldn't have intervened.

337
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,640
- You...
- Just wait.

338
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:42,000
I'm calling the police right now.

339
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,480
I'll have you all arrested.

340
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:44,680
We're the police.

341
00:16:45,930 --> 00:16:46,800
Forget it.

342
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,000
Forget it, forget it.

343
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:54,240
The police hit someone!

344
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:58,780
(Lanling Police Station)

345
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:05,580
(Proud of Who I Am,
Committed to What I Do)

346
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:06,640
Sorry, Captain,

347
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:07,920
for disturbing your rest.

348
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,080
It's fine.

349
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:10,800
This is the first complaint

350
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,140
the Hummer Commandos has received.

351
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:13,280
So I should be there.

352
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:17,720
I just can't stand
seeing a man hit a woman.

353
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:19,440
- If I weren't a cop, I'd have...
- Enough.

354
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,680
You pushed a bit too hard just now.

355
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:22,640
He needs rest for days.

356
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:23,960
Serves him right.

357
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:29,320
Captain.

358
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:32,040
If domestic violence happens once,
it'll be unstoppable.

359
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:34,000
Tolerance won't stop the abuse.

360
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,040
It only makes the violence worse.

361
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,400
If the woman could respond calmly

362
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,320
and fight back bravely,

363
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:41,080
maybe the guy wouldn't be so arrogant.

364
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:43,800
You think

365
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:46,480
things will go the way you imagine?

366
00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:48,310
You said it's domestic violence.

367
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:49,840
How much do you know about them?

368
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,000
Do you even know what happened before?

369
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,480
Director Liu already said,

370
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:56,120
those two fight all the time.

371
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:58,200
They've been to the station
more than once.

372
00:17:58,720 --> 00:17:59,680
Just a few days ago,

373
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:00,660
the woman bashed his head

374
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,040
with a bowl.

375
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:04,240
Neither of them

376
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:05,720
is a pushover.

377
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:08,680
Seriously?

378
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,200
That intense?

379
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:13,040
So what now?

380
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:16,600
Should I go apologize to them?

381
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:17,840
No need for that.

382
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:19,680
It's fine to take action,

383
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:20,960
just know your limits.

384
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:23,040
Let's go.

385
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:24,080
To Danyang's place.

386
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,120
We haven't had cake yet.

387
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,040
Alright.

388
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,960
Everyone was hoping you'd come.

389
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,120
Thanks.

390
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:31,640
But how can you guys relax if I go?

391
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:33,720
And with all your noise,

392
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:35,280
even Danyang's parents leave the house.

393
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:36,480
Spare me, alright?

394
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,640
I was really surprised this time.

395
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,400
That wasn't like you.

396
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:44,920
You've always been

397
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,280
the calmest one in the team.

398
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,120
What's up?

399
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:50,960
Still holding something in?

400
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:52,600
Looks like it.

401
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:01,720
It's like all the big
and small scars on me.

402
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:05,000
They're healed and no longer painful,

403
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,320
but the scars are still there.

404
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,160
Let's go.

405
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:30,580
(Police)

406
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,760
Captain didn't say anything to you?

407
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:36,560
No.

408
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:38,400
I acted impulsively.

409
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:39,960
Thought I ran into a domestic abuser.

410
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:42,960
Captain came all the way downstairs

411
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,240
and didn't even come in for cake?

412
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:45,480
Right.

413
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:48,360
Maybe she thought we wouldn't

414
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:49,400
be ourselves if she came.

415
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:51,640
No.

416
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:54,440
Something was off with her today.

417
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:56,320
She seemed preoccupied.

418
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:58,600
What could be bothering Captain?

419
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:00,920
Her work's going great,
her family's happy.

420
00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:02,720
She seems cheerful every day,

421
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:03,720
invincible even.

422
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:05,280
She seems even happier than me.

423
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:06,480
No way.

424
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:12,080
Maybe it's still because of that.

425
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,320
Because of what?

426
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:17,000
I heard it from my dad

427
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:19,960
that Captain once had a baby.

428
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:24,480
And where's the baby?

429
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:27,160
She got into a car accident

430
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,600
when she was pregnant.

431
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:31,040
The baby was failed to carry.

432
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:38,600
I always thought she didn't want kids

433
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:40,040
because of her job.

434
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:41,280
How could that be?

435
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:44,960
She's always blamed herself for it.

436
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,680
No wonder nobody in the team

437
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,000
ever mentioned it.

438
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,440
Who'd dare bring it up?

439
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,200
It breaks her heart every time.

440
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:55,520
We all just pretend we don't know.

441
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:56,800
Don't bring it up.

442
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:58,480
Alright.

443
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,720
Let's cut the cake.

444
00:21:01,910 --> 00:21:02,800
We ate all the snacks

445
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:03,720
while waiting for you.

446
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:04,880
Nothing left to eat.

447
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,760
Let's head downstairs and buy some.

448
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:08,440
- Yeah, let's go.
- Come on.

449
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:11,280
Hurry up.

450
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:35,620
(Supermarket)

451
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:36,840
I want to eat that.

452
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:09,560
What?

453
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:11,000
Why were you looking at them?

454
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:12,320
Looking at who?

455
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:14,240
Those policewomen.

456
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:15,520
I...

457
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:16,720
I wasn't!

458
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,080
Liar!

459
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:18,920
Your eyeballs almost

460
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,560
glued to them just now!

461
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:24,440
Come on, what are you doing?

462
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:26,400
You're even jealous of the police now?

463
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,280
So what? Cops aren't people?

464
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:30,200
Tell me, am I prettier or are they?

465
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:31,400
Come on.

466
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:33,520
Of course you are!

467
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:36,880
But you said you didn't look,

468
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,400
so how do you know?

469
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:39,440
Not only did you look,

470
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,600
you compared us, didn't you?

471
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:43,920
Stop being unreasonable!

472
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:45,400
I don't want to talk to you.

473
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:47,560
Don't walk away! Come back!

474
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:49,840
We're not done until

475
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:51,040
you explain yourself!

476
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:01,000
Shrew!

477
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:07,880
Crazy woman!

478
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,160
Babe, babe.

479
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:19,680
Are you okay?

480
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:20,600
What happened?

481
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:23,520
Blood.

482
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:28,560
You knew I was hurt, why'd you throw it?

483
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:30,400
You could've gotten me killed!

484
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,880
Why are you only blaming me?

485
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,880
Why not blame that policewoman?

486
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:37,120
If it weren't for them,
would it be this messy?

487
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:40,280
I won't just let this slide.

488
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:41,800
Come on, we'll go find her.

489
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:43,120
This is outrageous!

490
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:45,520
How old is Liu Danyang
after this birthday?

491
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,360
Don't say it!

492
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,920
18, like a blooming flower.

493
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:53,280
Happy birthday!

494
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:55,080
Happy 60th birthday!

495
00:23:58,680 --> 00:23:59,600
Someone's at the door.

496
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:01,040
Who is it?

497
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,160
Your hat.

498
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:06,840
What do you want?

499
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:09,240
Who is it?

500
00:24:10,150 --> 00:24:11,000
We need to talk.

501
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:12,050
What are you doing?

502
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:13,000
What's your problem?

503
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:14,760
Hey, what are you doing?

504
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:15,960
Let's go!

505
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:19,300
My boyfriend's got permanent damage now,

506
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:21,200
constantly gets nosebleeds.

507
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:23,000
What are you going to do about it?

508
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:24,760
Well.

509
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:25,720
Are you blackmailing us?

510
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:26,940
It's none of your business.

511
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:28,240
It's her.

512
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:43,680
I'm not afraid of you.

513
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:47,560
Sorry for earlier.

514
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:48,760
I apologize.

515
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:51,050
It's alright.

516
00:24:51,050 --> 00:24:52,640
Don't play dumb with me.

517
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:54,680
You hurt my boyfriend,

518
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:56,400
so you owe us his medical expenses.

519
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:59,080
20,000. Got it?

520
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:01,920
Who hit who?

521
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:03,120
She was afraid he'd hit you.

522
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:04,240
She was trying to help you.

523
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,480
Figure out the situation first.

524
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:07,240
Who needs your help anyway?

525
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:08,980
If you don't pay up,

526
00:25:08,990 --> 00:25:10,800
I'll keep filing complaints.

527
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:13,720
Oh, I'm gonna post this on TikTok too.

528
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:15,800
I'll upload it to all the apps,

529
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:19,240
saying you cops beat people.

530
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,280
Think about it carefully.

531
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:23,800
A matter that could be solved
with some cash.

532
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:25,040
Don't let this

533
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:27,200
end up harming your workplace.

534
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:29,400
You're public servants after all.

535
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:31,760
If this affects your jobs, I don't care.

536
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:37,400
Don't pull me. Such a coward.

537
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:38,800
Just listen to me.

538
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:39,960
Enough, Danyang.

539
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:41,680
Stop talking to them.

540
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:43,080
Just call the police.

541
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:44,000
I agree.

542
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:46,960
Call the police for what?

543
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:48,360
What do you mean?

544
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:49,570
You already signed

545
00:25:49,570 --> 00:25:51,360
a mediation agreement at the station.

546
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:53,360
Demanding money now

547
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:54,880
is extortion, you know?

548
00:25:55,310 --> 00:25:57,400
Once mediation resolves a case,

549
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:59,200
you can't go bothering
the other party again.

550
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:01,440
That's the law. You get it?

551
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:03,150
You...

552
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:04,560
Are you trying to trick me?

553
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,120
Did you sign it?

554
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:08,640
I did.

555
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:14,720
I've recorded everything

556
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,600
you just said on my phone.

557
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,120
According to the criminal code,

558
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:19,520
what you're doing now

559
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,600
already constitutes extortion.

560
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:26,120
Just wait when you get home.

561
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:27,640
Take care.

562
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,320
Officer.

563
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:30,400
Sorry about this.

564
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,520
We were just messing around.

565
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:34,920
Can't you two live peacefully?

566
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:36,680
Always fighting like this.

567
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:37,800
You don't understand.

568
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:39,560
Sometimes,

569
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:40,960
fighting

570
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:43,880
is just another way to show love.

571
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:46,320
Honey.

572
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:47,600
Oh my god.

573
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:49,880
You really recorded it?

574
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:51,280
Of course not.

575
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:52,640
I didn't even take out my phone.

576
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,160
Only an idiot would fall for it.

577
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,000
You clever little fox.

578
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,640
It's already 5 PM.

579
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:00,760
- What is it?
- No, no.

580
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:01,840
I gotta go.

581
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:02,840
I'm leaving. I'm leaving.

582
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:03,680
- Where to?
- I'm leaving!

583
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:04,680
I need to go home.

584
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:05,750
Your dad's looking for you?

585
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:07,680
Take it easy.

586
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:09,600
Skipping the cake?

587
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,280
- Let's keep eating.
- Yeah, keep eating.

588
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:24,140
(Binjiang Anti-narcotics Brigade)

589
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:25,080
Captain Zhu.

590
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,280
The test results are out.

591
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:28,440
Take a look.

592
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:29,760
Drugs in Guan Tingting's bag

593
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:31,120
are the same as the ones

594
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:32,000
at Sun Ping's place.

595
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,560
Same source, most likely.

596
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:39,880
Let's begin.

597
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:42,520
Okay.

598
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:44,400
There was one time

599
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:47,160
I went to Blue House Bar
with the girls from the factory.

600
00:27:47,310 --> 00:27:49,440
Some guys came over
and offered us drinks.

601
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:51,910
After drinking,

602
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,240
I don't know what happened.

603
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:55,820
I just felt so happy,

604
00:27:55,820 --> 00:27:57,580
and forgot all my worries,

605
00:27:57,900 --> 00:27:59,700
only kept laughing and joking.

606
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:02,300
I kind of realized

607
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:03,780
the drink was off.

608
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:05,100
So I told myself

609
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:07,260
never to go back
to a place like that again.

610
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:11,220
But one time,
when I was feeling really down,

611
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:13,780
I couldn't help going back.

612
00:28:14,380 --> 00:28:17,260
That time, someone offered me
something directly.

613
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:20,100
Do you remember

614
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:21,260
what they looked like?

615
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:25,380
He wore a hat and a mask.

616
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:27,660
It was super dark inside the bar.

617
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:29,380
I couldn't see his face.

618
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:32,140
And we only met face-to-face once.

619
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:34,300
After that, he always left the stuff

620
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:35,660
inside a toilet tank.

621
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:38,140
The harasser at train station

622
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:39,740
was the one

623
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:40,980
who had you deliver the goods?

624
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:43,380
Any identifying features?

625
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:46,260
He also wore a hat and mask.

626
00:28:46,540 --> 00:28:48,300
I couldn't see distinctive features.

627
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:50,860
And I had never seen him before.

628
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:51,900
How did you two meet?

629
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:53,100
Online.

630
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:54,860
I borrowed money from him once.

631
00:28:55,420 --> 00:28:57,620
But right from the start,

632
00:28:57,860 --> 00:28:58,780
I felt like

633
00:28:58,780 --> 00:29:00,460
he knew I needed money

634
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:01,620
because I was using drugs.

635
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:03,460
After that,

636
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:04,740
I kept borrowing more and more.

637
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:18,780
I've never met the person
who sold me the drugs.

638
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:21,900
Each transaction was at

639
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:24,460
the second bench near
the west entrance of People's Park.

640
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:26,540
The drugs were in a cigarette box.

641
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:37,980
Based on their trading methods,

642
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:38,900
I believe

643
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:40,700
they're the same gang

644
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:42,220
we arrested earlier.

645
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:45,340
Captain Zhu is right.

646
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:46,700
After just a few days,

647
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:47,860
they're back again.

648
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:49,340
I think

649
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:50,380
they're trying

650
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:52,260
to rebuild the drug trafficking network.

651
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:56,140
After we took out
so many of their mobile routes,

652
00:29:56,410 --> 00:29:58,580
they won't risk outsiders for deliveries.

653
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:01,780
The recent transactions
are definitely by insiders.

654
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:03,380
So, let's gather

655
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:05,460
the recently discovered
transaction locations.

656
00:30:05,780 --> 00:30:07,340
See if there's any commonality.

657
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:09,780
These people have
clear divisions of labor.

658
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:11,940
Some of them specifically
guide these drug users

659
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:13,180
to traffic to fund drugs use.

660
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:14,260
Others use

661
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:15,140
high-interest loans

662
00:30:15,140 --> 00:30:17,100
to provide drug money to these addicts,

663
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:18,580
driving them deeper into the trap.

664
00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:19,780
We need to find the harasser

665
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:21,260
who targeted Guan Tingting

666
00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:22,860
near the train station.

667
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:25,500
Since he was able
to arrange for Han Ning to deliver,

668
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:27,780
it shows he holds
a high position in the organization.

669
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:29,420
He is likely

670
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:31,620
the Wenzi we are looking for.

671
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:35,140
(Cheesy Pizza)

672
00:30:42,260 --> 00:30:43,340
Hey, Wenzi.

673
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:46,820
Boss.

674
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:48,300
Jie.

675
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:50,020
Keep an eye out.

676
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:52,540
I need a word with Wenzi.

677
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:12,220
The heat is intense right now,

678
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:14,340
and you're still running around?

679
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:15,860
Don't you know the cops' searching?

680
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:17,540
Boss, don't be mad.

681
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:19,820
I can't just hide out all the time

682
00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:21,260
without doing anything.

683
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:22,860
I'm being really careful.

684
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:25,180
I wear a mask whenever I go out.

685
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:26,540
It's been a while,

686
00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:27,740
and nothing's happened.

687
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:32,620
So, what did you find out?

688
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:35,660
I went to see Guan Tingting.

689
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:36,860
She said

690
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:38,980
the goods are with Wu.

691
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:40,620
Too bad,

692
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:42,460
I can't find that Wu anywhere.

693
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:44,020
It's like he just vanished.

694
00:31:48,580 --> 00:31:49,900
Listen up.

695
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:51,780
From now on,

696
00:31:52,460 --> 00:31:53,980
stay put and don't go anywhere.

697
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:55,940
If you sneak out again,

698
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:57,580
watch your legs.

699
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:00,900
Boss.

700
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:02,260
What about our goods?

701
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:04,940
You don't think he took our money

702
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:06,180
and skipped town, do you?

703
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:09,340
He wouldn't dare.

704
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:12,780
He took my money.

705
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:15,020
Either he brings the goods,

706
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:17,980
or he brings his life.

707
00:32:52,550 --> 00:32:53,460
Not bad.

708
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:54,780
Two seconds faster than before.

709
00:32:56,390 --> 00:32:57,260
Look.

710
00:32:57,260 --> 00:32:58,300
