this is Li Hao's home.

if there's any updates.

49
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:38,620
Must've gone that way.

Let's go.

51
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:56,020
Go.

Stop! Don't run!

Stop right there!

57
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:11,420
Stop!

58
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:13,580
Why were you running?

59
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:15,060
I panicked.

60
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,180
I thought that guy was chasing me.

61
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:19,900
My leg hurts.

62
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:21,660
Take me to the hospital!

63
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:22,820
Cut the act.

64
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:24,420
What did you just throw?

65
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:25,940
I didn't throw anything.

66

Bodycam

67
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:28,300

Go. Bring it here.

70
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:42,140

we've got him.

73
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:53,340
Found a bag of suspected drugs.

74
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:54,940
(Police)
Notify the anti-narcotics brigade.

75
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:56,740
After the handover,
go find Li Hao's wife

76
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:57,740
to get some background info.

77
00:03:57,740 --> 00:03:58,660
Yes.

78
00:03:58,850 --> 00:04:00,940
Captain Ye, suspect's vehicle located,

79
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:02,700
(Integrated Police Communication System)
HAF11453,

80
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:04,980
was seen on Route 115
in the North Industrial Park.

81
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,740
Xin, Route 115.

82
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:07,660
Yes.

83
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:22,060
He passed out?

84
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:32,220
Wang Xiao, I'm telling you,

85
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:34,690
once we catch Jin Yibo,

86
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:36,760
your chance to surrender is gone.

87
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:38,630
Think carefully.

88
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:43,220
Dajun.

89
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:44,300
Let's move out.

90
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:47,140
I'll tell you.

91
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:51,500
What grudge does Li Hao have

92
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:52,820
with these two guys?

93
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:54,940
Why go to such extremes?

94
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:56,540
Even though both got injured,

95
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:58,100
based on the footage,

96
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:00,180
Li Hao was clearly targeting Jin Yibo.

97
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:05,260
I didn't want to sell drugs to your son!

98
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:06,900
They forced me!

99
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:08,180
Sir, please.

100
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:09,020
I'm begging you.

101
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:10,140
I'm begging you, sir!

102
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:11,300
Shut up!

103
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:13,900
Yell again and I'll cut your tongue out.

Captain Ye, we lost the target.

108
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:10,900
The suspect's vehicle
might have entered Route 115

109
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:12,420
(Police Dispatch)
a surveillance blind spot.

110
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:13,340
Got it.

111
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:18,820
- Hello?
- Captain Ye.

112
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:20,060
Wang Xiao confessed.

113
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:22,820
He and Jin Yibo broke into
Li Hao's place to steal drugs,

114
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:24,100
and got caught by Li Hao.

115
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:25,700
Li Hao has drugs?

116
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:26,900
Technically speaking,

117
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:29,900
it belonged to Li Hao's son, Li Mingzhe.

118
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:31,980
Before he died,

119
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:34,220
Li Mingzhe apparently
stole a batch from Jin Yibo.

120
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:36,140
That's why he was hunted.

121
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:38,260
There's more to the story.

122
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:40,260
Okay. Got it.

123
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:47,980
Captain Ye, Li Hao's vehicle

124
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:49,780
was spotted
in the North Industrial Park.

125
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:51,700
North Industrial Park?

126
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:54,100
Warehouse No. 16.

127
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:57,100
The last place Li Mingzhe stayed.

128
00:06:57,700 --> 00:06:59,420
Do you recognize this person?

129
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:00,580
His name is Jin Yibo.

130
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:08,080
Have you noticed anything unusual

131
00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:09,680
about Li Hao recently?

132
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:14,060
He said he wanted a divorce.

133
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:25,380
We've been married for 30 years.

134
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:27,580
No one knows him better than I do.

135
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:29,100
Others might say

136
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:32,380
he's a bit spineless.

137
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:35,300
But to me and our son,

138
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:36,900
he was a good husband,

139
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:38,340
a good father.

140
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:41,540
He worked tirelessly every day

141
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:43,900
all for this family.

142
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:47,060
He values family above all.

143
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:50,300
And he's hard on himself,

144
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:52,780
never spent a penny carelessly.

145
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:56,900
Let alone have any shady intentions.

146
00:07:57,660 --> 00:07:58,900
But lately,

147
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:02,020
he's completely changed.

148
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:04,940
He's always picking fights with me,

149
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:07,420
said he wanted a divorce

150
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:11,220
and wanted to live a better life.

151
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:14,660
But he left everything to me,

152
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:16,300
and walked out with nothing.

153
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:17,740
I feel like

154
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:20,100
he's hiding something from me.

155
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:23,100
Can you recall when this change

156
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:24,700
in him began?

157
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:28,700
After our son passed away.

158
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:31,940
It's my fault too.

159
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:34,540
I kept thinking about our son

160
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:36,020
and ignored him.

161
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:44,100
He must've kept it from Ma Xiaoling

162
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:45,260
and went after Jin Yibo.

163
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,660
Li Mingzhe died because of drugs.

164
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:48,980
Of course Li Hao would hate

165
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:51,020
the classmate who gave his son drugs,

166
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:53,660
and the dealers who sold it to him too.

167
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:56,220
But he had the chance to kill Jin Yibo,

168
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:57,740
why bring him to the warehouse?

169
00:08:57,740 --> 00:08:58,700
To make him suffer.

170
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:00,540
He's like my dad,

171
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:01,900
the kind of father who gives

172
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:04,420
everything he's got for his child.

173
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:06,100
Now his dad must hate

174
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:07,540
the one who killed his son.

175
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:08,900
It's not just revenge.

176
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:11,460
He's divorcing his wife now.

177
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:14,140
It's clearly to cut ties with her.

178
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:17,300
I think he doesn't even
want to let himself go.

179
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:28,420
Sir, sir, sir!

180
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:29,540
Please, spare me!

181
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:31,300
Where are you taking me?

182
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:38,180
Please, let me go!

183
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:44,260
Sir.

184
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:45,500
Spare me.

185
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:46,500
Help!

186
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:47,860
Help me!

187
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:54,540
Sir.

188
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:55,420
Sir, please.

189
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:56,700
Please!

190
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:58,940
Don't kill me! Don't kill me!

191
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:00,900
I'm begging you.

192
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:01,940
I beg you.

193
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:04,860
Let me go, please.

194
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:06,220
Please.

195
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:08,500
Have mercy!

196
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:10,180
Please, let me go!

197
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:16,900
Sir.

198
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:17,820
Spare me, please.

199
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:19,980
Please let me go! I'm begging you!

200
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:25,660
Don't kill me!

201
00:10:58,020 --> 00:10:58,940
Sir.

202
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:02,060
I was wrong.

203
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:04,300
I beg you.

204
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:07,060
Don't kill me.

205
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:21,540
(Li)

206
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:25,100
Pick up.

207
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:27,220
Stay calm. You're helping him.

208
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:28,460
Put it on speaker.

209
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:32,340
(Li)

210
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:33,460
Li!

211
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:34,700
Where are you?

212
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:37,140
Please come back, I'm begging you.

213
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:39,940
I won't argue with you ever again.

214
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:41,740
Please don't do anything stupid!

215
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:42,740
Xiaoling.

216
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:43,660
Don't ask.

217
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:46,020
Just listen to me.

218
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:47,260
I have to do

219
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:48,620
some things.

220
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:52,580
It's almost over now.

221
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:53,860
What are you doing?

222
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:55,940
Don't scare me like this!

223
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:58,860
Li, please come home.

224
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:01,700
You've suffered

225
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:05,020
with me this life.

226
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:06,900
From now on,

227
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:08,300
take care of yourself.

228
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:09,980
Do what makes you happy.

229
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:13,100
That's what

230
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:15,460
life should be like.

231
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:18,220
We come with nothing,

232
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:19,620
leave with nothing.

233
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:21,740
There's nothing to be sad about.

234
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:23,380
What do you mean?

235
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:24,620
Where are you?

236
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:26,220
I'm coming to find you.

237
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:28,680
I've failed you

238
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:31,820
and our child.

239
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:35,820
Li.

240
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:37,220
Li!

241
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:54,940
Captain.

242
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:56,620
Li Hao called Ma Xiaoling,

243
00:12:56,980 --> 00:12:59,220
clearly saying his final goodbye.

244
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:01,260
Xin, speed up.

245
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:02,180
Yes.

246
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:14,660
Please.

247
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:17,420
Don't kill me.

248
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,820
Please don't.

249
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:26,500
I'm begging you.

250
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:01,540
- Captain.
- Don't.

251
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:03,100
Give him back to me.

252
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:04,500
Or I'll kill her.

253
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:08,060
Li Hao.

254
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:09,140
Calm down first.

255
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:11,540
You're doing this for your son, right?

256
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:12,620
That's right.

257
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:15,140
If he hadn't sold drugs to my son,

258
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:16,620
none of this would've happened.

259
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:17,900
Besides my son,

260
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:19,660
he sold drugs to others too.

261
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:20,860
So I'm taking revenge

262
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,700
for all of them.

263
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:24,140
I understand all of that.

264
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,940
But is this what your son would want?

265
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:30,780
Look at him.

266
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:34,020
He wants you to live well

267
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:36,380
and take care of his mother.

268
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:39,260
So,

269
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:41,620
please, I beg you,

270
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:43,620
kill him for me.

271
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:44,780
Kill that drug dealer.

272
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:46,810
Please.

273
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:48,220
Li Hao,

274
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:50,020
we can't do that.

275
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:52,290
We won't let you hurt him.

276
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:54,540
Hurt him?

277
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:58,110
You're the good guy, right?

278
00:14:58,740 --> 00:14:59,660
Even now,

279
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:01,060
you're protecting him?

280
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:02,540
You want to save him?

281
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:03,900
I don't want to save him.

282
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:05,260
I want to save you.

283
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:07,020
Is he really worth it?

284
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:08,140
Yes!

285
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:10,380
I don't want you to save me.

286
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:13,460
When he sold drugs to my son

287
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:14,700
and ruined his life,

288
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:16,140
I desperately hoped

289
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:19,700
you would arrest every one
of those dealers.

290
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:21,340
Where were you?

291
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:23,220
Where were you then?

292
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:24,740
We were always here.

293
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:30,340
Who are you?

294
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:35,140
Zhu Huaiyang, Deputy Captain
of the Anti-narcotics Brigade.

295
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:39,620
I know you hate drug dealers.

296
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:41,990
So do we.

297
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:44,940
Let me be honest,

298
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:46,780
every year, some of

299
00:15:47,970 --> 00:15:49,170
my colleagues die.

300
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:51,740
Behind every loss

301
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:53,900
is a broken family.

302
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:57,100
We're just ordinary people too.

303
00:15:57,260 --> 00:15:58,500
We're not gods.

304
00:15:58,500 --> 00:15:59,870
But I promise you,

305
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:02,670
as long as drugs are made,

306
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:04,950
as long as they're used,

307
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:08,380
we will keep fighting.

308
00:16:10,610 --> 00:16:11,470
Sir,

309
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:13,940
you're partly responsible too.

310
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:16,700
Why didn't you report him

311
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:17,940
when you knew he dealt drugs?

312
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:20,260
Things wouldn't have gone this far.

313
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:21,340
You done talking?

314
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:24,420
Let me tell you,

315
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:27,340
I don't care about your righteous words.

316
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:29,620
I just have one question.

317
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:31,500
Can you kill him?

318
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:34,020
Can you bring my son back?

319
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:36,700
If not, don't stand in my way.

320
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:38,380
To be honest,

321
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:40,060
I have no personal feud

322
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:42,300
with Officer Ye.

323
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:44,540
I really don't want to hurt her.

324
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:46,420
As long as you agree,

325
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:48,940
I'll let her go.

326
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:52,100
His life or death

327
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:54,100
is for the law to decide.

328
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:55,380
Not up to you,

329
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:56,700
and not up to me.

330
00:16:58,140 --> 00:16:59,820
Even if he's sentenced to death,

331
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:00,740
right now,

332
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:02,740
he still has the right to live.

333
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:04,180
The right to live?

334
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:07,140
That drug dealer has the right to live?

335
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:08,620
What about my son?

336
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:17,140
How about this?

337
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:19,740
Let me make a deal with you.

338
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:21,740
Use me

339
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:23,780
in exchange for Captain Ye.

340
00:17:24,340 --> 00:17:25,260
Okay?

341
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:26,780
To be honest,

342
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:28,780
we're married.

343
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:31,380
As a man, I think

344
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:35,340
you can understand how I feel now.

345
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:39,700
We don't even have children yet.

346
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:42,140
In this world,

347
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:46,500
she's the only family I have.

348
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:50,980
I'm begging you.

349
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:01,220
Li Hao!

350
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:02,540
Li Hao!

351
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:04,140
Li Hao!

352
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:06,860
Why are you doing this?

353
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:09,900
I can't go on anymore.

354
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,650
After losing my son,

355
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:14,020
my world fell apart.

356
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,300
I lost everything.

357
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:18,040
I feel dead inside!

358
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:21,200
Li Hao.

359
00:18:23,010 --> 00:18:24,350
What about your wife?

360
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:26,530
She'd lose both son and husband.

361
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:28,940
How would she live?

362
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:29,900
Li.

363
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:32,780
Do you remember?

364
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:36,540
Your son once said
the same thing to you.

365
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:38,820
He thought

366
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:41,780
without him, we'd have it easier.

367
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:43,180
But,

368
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:44,660
without him,

369
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:47,390
we all fell apart.

370
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,220
Why not buy yourself something nice?

371
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:53,300
Be kinder to yourself.

372
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:55,420
You're not living this life just for me.

373
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:58,380
Dad, please take care of yourself.

374
00:18:59,390 --> 00:19:00,980
Stop neglecting yourself.

375
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:03,500
Li.

376
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:05,230
If anything happens to you,

377
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:08,880
I really wouldn't be able to live on.

378
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:14,660
Let Captain Ye go.

379
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:15,820
Please let her go.

380
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:17,220
I beg you.

381
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:19,740
Just listen to the police.

382
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:20,860
Those criminals

383
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:24,100
will get the punishment they deserve.

384
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:26,660
Let's wait together

385
00:19:26,770 --> 00:19:28,770
to see them caught

386
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:30,180
and sentenced.

387
00:19:31,210 --> 00:19:35,730
Just be patient, Li.

388
00:19:36,610 --> 00:19:37,540
Don't

389
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:40,370
push yourself into a corner.

390
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:45,430
Our family needs you.

391
00:19:45,970 --> 00:19:48,270
I need you.

392
00:19:49,630 --> 00:19:53,000
You're all I have left!

393
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:56,970
Please.

394
00:19:58,170 --> 00:19:59,010
Li Hao.

395
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:02,110
Mingzhe would want you to live on.

396
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:04,230
Li.

397
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:05,900
- Trust me.
- Li.

398
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:09,240
- We'll catch the drug dealers for you.
- Please.

399
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:11,820
Live well for your son.

400
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:15,780
Okay?

401
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:19,300
Please.

402
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:48,420
Li.

403
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:51,860
Li!

404
00:20:52,610 --> 00:20:53,660
Li!

405
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:01,340
Li!

406
00:21:03,870 --> 00:21:05,150
Li.

407
00:21:05,510 --> 00:21:06,670
Li!

408
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:13,900
Are you okay?

409
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:16,540
I'm fine.

410
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:19,930
It's okay now.

411
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:41,660
Captain.

412
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:43,020
That was too risky just now.

413
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:45,100
What if Li Hao had lost control
and hurt you?

414
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:47,100
Captain.

415
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:48,460
You could've subdued him.

416
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:52,780
He's not a bad man.

417
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:54,420
He didn't want to hurt me.

418
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:57,860
He's just someone who lost his son

419
00:21:57,860 --> 00:21:59,740
and all hope in life.

420
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:01,740
It wasn't hard to take him down.

421
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:03,340
But after that, then what?

422
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:10,300
Li Hao

423
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:12,860
has been living in guilt and pain.

424
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:14,860
Even so,

425
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:18,100
he still tried to ensure
Ma Xiaoling would be okay.

426
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:20,780
Clearly, he hadn't
lost his mind completely.

427
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:22,860
He still cares about something.

428
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:26,900
So, you were trying

429
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:28,620
to give him an outlet,

430
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:29,740
to guide him,

431
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:31,660
let him see the people he cares about

432
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:33,220
give him a reason to live.

433
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:35,540
So that's what it was.

434
00:22:36,610 --> 00:22:37,460
You have no idea

435
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:39,300
we were all afraid
Li Hao would hurt you.

436
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:41,220
Captain Zhu was more worried than me.

437
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:42,500
Captain Zhu?

438
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:43,580
What about him?

439
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:45,700
You came late and didn't see it.

440
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:46,940
Captain Zhu said

441
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:48,540
he'd trade places with our captain.

442
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:51,660
And he confessed his love.

443
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:53,740
What did he say? Tell us!

444
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:56,700
Li Hao asked,

445
00:22:57,580 --> 00:22:59,340
"What's your relationship?"

446
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:00,860
Captain Zhu said,

447
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:04,780
"Captain Ye is the most
important person to me.

448
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:06,100
The one I care for most."

449
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:09,260
- Wanru!
- So sweet, Captain!

450
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:10,180
That's too sweet!

451
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:12,340
It's too sweet, Captain!

452
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:14,060
So sweet!

453
00:23:16,670 --> 00:23:17,700
Alright, enough.

454
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:20,180
Captain's feeling shy.

455
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:21,860
I'll stop.

456
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:23,340
It's really lovely.

457
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:25,180
Do you think

458
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:27,060
Li Hao hate himself more,

459
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:28,740
or Jin Yibo?

460
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:32,700
I think he hated himself more.

461
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:34,900
Otherwise, he wouldn't have done this.

462
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:38,060
He nearly made a terrible mistake.

463
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:40,660
Good thing he listened to Ma Xiaoling.

464
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:45,020
That's the power of true love.

465
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:49,460
Why are you laughing?

466
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:50,660
Did I say something wrong?

467
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:53,980
If he didn't have his wife in his heart,

468
00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:55,480
didn't know she cared,

469
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:56,540
would he have come to his senses?

470
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:58,660
That's what family means.

471
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:02,980
Seriously,

472
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:05,300
Liu Danyang, what happened to you?

473
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:07,500
You've suddenly become so

474
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:09,140
emotional.

475
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:11,620
You wouldn't get it.

476
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:15,460
I've always been a perfect mix
of logic and emotion.

477
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:18,220
Danyang,

478
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:19,980
you've really changed a lot lately.

479
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:22,060
I think you're getting a bit sensitive.

480
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:29,620
I think Captain's pretty enviable.

481
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:32,700
So many strong women

482
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:34,980
don't have a man to love them.

483
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:36,900
But our captain's different.

484
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:39,020
She's got Captain Zhu by her side,

485
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:40,180
caring for her.

486
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:43,660
She has love and a career.

487
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:48,480
What are you smiling at?

488
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:49,820
I told them

489
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:51,730
mountain climbing is your thing.

490
00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:53,390
Of course I am.

491
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:55,260
Back in sports school,

492
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:57,810
it would take guys two or three hours,

493
00:24:58,460 --> 00:24:59,380
but I

494
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:01,060
could do it in just one hour.

495
00:25:04,780 --> 00:25:05,940
What are you doing, Liu Danyang?

496
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:07,220
You scared me!

497
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:08,740
It's late!

498
00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:11,820
You told them I'm good at hiking.

499
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:13,580
Did you tell them

500
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:15,300
about my love history?

501
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:16,460
Is that why they were laughing?

502
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:18,300
No, I didn't!

503
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:20,180
You didn't... Did she?

504
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:21,660
No!

505
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:23,100
- Was it her?
- No!

506
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:24,980
You're too sensitive, Liu Danyang!

507
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:26,740
- Mai Jialing, you're dead today!
- You're being sensitive!

508
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:28,300
What are you doing?

509
00:25:28,570 --> 00:25:29,500
What are you doing?

510
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:30,660
I... I'm sorry!

511
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:31,780
- Was it you?
- No!

512
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:32,900
Apologize!

513
00:25:34,790 --> 00:25:35,640
Don't you...

514
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:36,500
I'm sorry!

515
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:38,980
I feel sorry for your

516
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:40,140
future boyfriends.

517
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:42,340
- I was wrong!
- You were wrong!

518
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:44,380
(Binjiang Public Security Bureau)

519
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:47,860
Were you at Yongsheng Pharmaceutical Factory
on the night of the 22nd?

520
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:49,660
Officer,

521
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:53,260
I'm exhausted.
I'm seriously about to collapse.

522
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:54,420
I'm asking you,

523
00:25:54,780 --> 00:25:55,700
were you or were you not?

524
00:25:59,670 --> 00:26:00,820
You're so annoying.

525
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:02,900
What pharmaceutical factory?

526
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:05,470
Why would I go to
a pharmaceutical factory?

527
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:06,750
Need me to remind you?

528
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:09,620
Officer,

529
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:11,320
you can't just frame me.

530
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:14,380
I'm just a runner.

531
00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:16,460
I can't make drugs.

532
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:18,140
I don't even know how.

533
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:19,740
So you're admitting it?

534
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:21,700
I didn't admit it.

535
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:23,660
I didn't admit a single thing!

536
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:25,780
You're twisting my words.

537
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:28,100
I know exactly what you're implying.

538
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:29,300
Cut the act.

539
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:30,900
Wang Xiao already confessed.

540
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:32,900
His words can't be trusted.

541
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:34,300
We can't trust his words,

542
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:36,420
but we can trust the product.

543
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:38,380
You've stepped up your game.

544
00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:40,490
Purity's much higher now.

545
00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:45,700
I have no idea what you mean.

546
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:48,260
We found your drugs

547
00:26:48,610 --> 00:26:50,260
in Wang Xiao's place.

548
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:51,260
Understand?

549
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:53,100
I didn't sell him anything.

550
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:54,780
You think we arrest people
without evidence?

551
00:26:56,180 --> 00:26:57,980
The guard at the factory identified you.

552
00:26:58,300 --> 00:26:59,900
He said you beat him hard.

553
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:00,900
That's nonsense!

554
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:02,280
That head injury was...

555
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:14,500
I'll tell you the truth.

556
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:16,740
That guard didn't make it.

557
00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:19,460
He passed away the night before last.

558
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:21,300
If you want to cover this up,

559
00:27:21,490 --> 00:27:22,500
you'll carry

560
00:27:22,930 --> 00:27:23,940
the blame.

561
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:28,220
Why?

562
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:29,500
Why me?

563
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:30,780
I can't take that!

564
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:34,660
Tell us.

565
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:38,740
Okay.

566
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:41,220
I wasn't the one who hit him.

567
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:42,140
It was Mad Dog!

568
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:43,380
He made the drugs.

569
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:44,820
I don't even know how.

570
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:47,020
I am just the errand guy.

571
00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:48,460
If you keep me locked up,

572
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:49,700
I won't be of any use.

573
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:50,620
Where does he live?

574
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:52,740
Yulan New Village.

575
00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:34,500
Captain Zhu, no one's here.

576
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:36,740
We've secured the perimeter.

577
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:38,460
He can't have gone far.

578
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:39,520
Start the search.

579
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:40,460
- Yes.
- Yes.

580
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:41,380
Go.

581
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:16,660
Don't move!

582
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:18,020
Run and I'll shoot!

583
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:23,180
Don't move!

584
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:27,620
Freeze!

585
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:28,660
Final warning!

586
00:30:31,180 --> 00:30:32,100
Move!

587
00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:43,340
Hands in the air!

588
00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:50,620
Turn around and face me!

589
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:53,180
Turn around!

590
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:07,980
Get on!

591
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:30,540

592
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:32,060
Captain Zhu!

593
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:37,540
- Captain Zhu!
- Captain Zhu!

594
00:31:37,540 --> 00:31:38,540
Where are you hurt?

595
00:31:38,540 --> 00:31:39,580
Captain Zhu, wake up!

596
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:41,100

I got shot.

624
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:34,060
But I was wearing a bulletproof vest.

625
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:37,340

626
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:41,700
the shockwave knocked me out.

The doctor said

628
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:47,580
the injury isn't serious.

629
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:50,860
You scared me.

630
00:33:51,910 --> 00:33:53,280
Why are you crying?

631
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:56,050

It's nothing.

00:34:01,020 --> 00:34:02,540
Really? You're not lying to me?

635
00:34:04,420 --> 00:34:05,660
Why would I lie to you?

636
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:09,420
Stop crying.

637
00:34:09,860 --> 00:34:11,260
There's nothing to cry about.

638
00:34:12,740 --> 00:34:13,820
I'm fine.

639
00:34:14,380 --> 00:34:15,300
You don't believe me?

640
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:18,420
Do I have to get off bed and walk?

641
00:34:18,420 --> 00:34:19,340
Come on, I'll walk.

642
00:34:19,740 --> 00:34:21,220

647
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:29,540
I feel dizzy.

648
00:34:30,620 --> 00:34:32,020
But the doctor said

649
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:35,220
I might have

650
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:38,660
a lingering side effect.

651
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:40,220
What?

652
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:44,620
I can't sleep on the couch at night.

653
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:47,850
Nonsense.

654
00:34:48,220 --> 00:34:49,180
Easy there!

655
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:50,740
Still joking around?

656
00:34:50,740 --> 00:34:52,260
I'm fine, really.

657
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:53,860
But

658
00:34:54,940 --> 00:34:56,580
when you cried like that,

659
00:34:57,500 --> 00:34:59,020

660
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:04,380

about your husband.

661
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:09,700
Why do I feel so dizzy?

662
00:35:10,540 --> 00:35:11,460
Alright,

663
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:13,100
get some sleep.

664
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:14,180
Rest well.

665
00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:15,460
Okay.

666
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:16,470
