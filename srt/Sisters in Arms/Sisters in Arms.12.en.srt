It's actually painful

26
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:49,440
for the child too.

27
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,560
What are you doing?

28
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,800
I'm cleaning up.

29
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,740
Getting ready to welcome you home
this weekend.

30
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,280
Don't bother.

31
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,200
Bring out the cake.

32
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,480
What cake?

33
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:26,720
Stop joking.

34
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:29,040
Come on, get it out.

35
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,520
There's no cake.

36
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,160
Didn't I ask you to get the cake?

37
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,280
You didn't forget, did you?

38
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,520
I returned it.

39
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:47,400
Ye Zhen.

40
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,720
We can't keep living in the past.

41
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:54,420
I think

42
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,520
by now,

43
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,560
we should say goodbye to him.

44
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,560
We can't keep reminding

45
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:04,640
ourselves of him this way

46
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,000
that he once existed in this world.

47
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,160
You mean

48
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,720
I should forget him?

49
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:13,960
Ye Zhen.

50
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,360
If we can't move on,

51
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,680
he won't rest in peace either.

52
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:20,960
You have no right to say that.

53
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,120
So how long...

54
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,960
How long are you planning on doing this?

55
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,320
It's been three years.

56
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,040
Then what? Five years more?

57
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:29,880
Ten more?

58
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:30,800
Your whole life?

59
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:34,920
Why not let yourself go?

60
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,120
Let's look forward.

61
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,040
Zhu Huaiyang.

62
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:43,600
You're so cruel.

63
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,280
There's something seriously
wrong with your pulse.

64
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,400
It's floating, big, and rough.

65
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:53,320
Tense and strong on the right.

66
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,200
Speak properly.

67
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,120
Use normal words.

68
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,600
These past few days,

69
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,920
haven't you been experiencing
a loss of appetite,

70
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,040
poor sleep,

71
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,960
and heat in your palms and soles?

72
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,120
Yeah.

73
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,200
You're quite good.

74
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,080
Of course.

75
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,240
You think my title as

76
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,920
miracle-working Doctor is just for show?

77
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,480
So what's the diagnosis?

78
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,350
Food accumulation disorder.

79
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,200
Food accumulation disorder?

80
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,080
What does that mean?

81
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,600
It means you overate.

82
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,560
Exactly.

83
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,570
She totally overate.

84
00:06:26,570 --> 00:06:28,000
Her mouth hasn't stopped.

85
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:28,840
Stop eating!

86
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:30,340
- I haven't started.
- Give it to Xin.

87
00:06:30,450 --> 00:06:32,040
She's still growing.

88
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,080
Food accumulation disorder.

89
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:36,680
I knew it, you're just a quack.

90
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,440
Taking shots at me.

91
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,240
Seriously, don't doubt it.

92
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,600
Eat less.

93
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:42,760
It's good for you.

94
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,120
Tata's the only one who's good to me.

95
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,680
Tata's the only one who's good to me.

96
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,560
Be careful. Captain will call you fat.

97
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,360
No way.

98
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,640
- Captain.
- Captain Ye.

99
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:12,200
- Captain.
- Captain.

100
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,120
Finished eating?

101
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,280
Uh, time to patrol.

102
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,880
Captain's eyes are swollen.

103
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:23,560
Looks like she just cried.

104
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:27,400
It must be

105
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,400
because

106
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,720
Li Na's baby brought back memories.

107
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:34,640
You're full of ideas.

108
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:35,560
Think of something.

109
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,880
What can I do?

110
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,160
You can't ease this pain

111
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,080
with painkillers.

112
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:47,880
When my mom died back then,

113
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,360
my dad and I almost couldn't go on.

114
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,480
It was really tough.

115
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:57,800
Sorry.

116
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,480
I didn't mean to bring up sad memories.

117
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:05,560
But after my mom passed,

118
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,880
my dad suddenly became

119
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,880
super strict and overbearing.

120
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,200
So I kept going against him

121
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,800
and didn't even have time to grieve.

122
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,800
I don't think Mr. Lin is as cold-hearted

123
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,160
as you think he is.

124
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,160
Maybe he did it on purpose

125
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,920
to help you shift your focus.

126
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,960
I never thought of it that way.

127
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:35,720
But all of Lin's sadness

128
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,160
turned into torment for me.

129
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,080
Don't worry too much about Captain.

130
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:45,200
She has

131
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,120
Captain Zhu on her side.

(People's Square, Blue House Bar)

151
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,360
Captain Zhu.

152
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:21,720
We found him.

153
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,160
This guy, Wenzi,

154
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,440
his real name is Feng Qidong.

155
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:25,840
Just as you suspected,

156
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:26,920
he's not only a drug dealer

157
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:28,080
but also a loan shark.

158
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:29,520
He specifically lends to addicts

159
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:30,960
to keep them hooked long-term.

160
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,560
Where is he now?

161
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:33,560
According to his family,

162
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,000
he's been missing for six months.

163
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,040
They knew he was involved in crime,

164
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,280
so they didn't dare call the police.

165
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:41,600
But I collected his father's DNA sample.

166
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,560
Guess what?

167
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:48,520
It matches the guy with the gold watch.

168
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:49,720
Yes, Captain Zhu.

169
00:10:49,930 --> 00:10:52,080
He died in Wu's place.

170
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:55,640
Now it's basically confirmed

171
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:56,850
that Wu isn't dead.

172
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,260
The most important thing now

173
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:00,490
is to find him sooner.

174
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:09,240
You're being way too kind.

175
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:11,160
Yun'er was discharged today.

176
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:13,240
We've been wanting to thank you.

I'm not busy.

186
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:33,040
Came to pick you up from work.

187
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:38,120
This is my husband, Zhu Huaiyang.

Hello, hello.

191
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,920
Didn't expect to run into you here.

192
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:45,960
Yeah, what a coincidence.

193
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:48,360
You two have met?

194
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:50,440
Yes.

195
00:11:51,290 --> 00:11:52,800
Two weeks ago at Changxing Road,

196
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:54,480
some clients got drunk,

197
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,440
and Officer Zhu helped me out.

198
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:58,840
I just happened to be there.

199
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:03,120
Since you both helped me out,

200
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,280
if you have time,

201
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,480
could I invite you for a meal?

202
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:07,970
That won't be necessary.

203
00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:08,900
We have strict rules.

204
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:10,520
Yes.

205
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:12,320
Besides, it's all part of the job.

206
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,080
No need to be so formal.

207
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,320
Captain Ye,

208
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,760
is Officer An here?

209
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,400
I'd like to speak with her.

210
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:20,080
Sure.

211
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,120
You wanted to see me?

212
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,200
Officer An,

213
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:26,000
I have a match on the 6th next month.

214
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:26,840
Can you come?

215
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:28,890
It's a weekend,

216
00:12:28,890 --> 00:12:30,040
so it won't affect your work.

217
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,200
Is your leg okay?

218
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,360
You can't risk another injury.

219
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:35,200
It'll be a bit tough,

220
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:36,600
but I'll do my best.

221
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,400
I might have a problem.

222
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:55,320
If my teammates knew I went alone

223
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,240
and didn't take them,

224
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:57,800
I'd be in trouble.

225
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,780
Well, it's even better if

226
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:01,840
they're willing to come.

227
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,720
If there's no emergency that day,

228
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:07,760
we'll definitely be there.

229
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:08,680
It's a deal.

230
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:11,720
It's a deal.

231
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,240
Still mad?

232
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:44,280
Just focus on driving.

233
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:54,560
It really was a coincidence
to see Ai Lian.

234
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:57,400
I literally ran into her on the street.

235
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:15,320
Try it.

236
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:19,920
Tastes good, right?

237
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,800
I realized that

238
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,520
I have real talent for cooking.

239
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:27,800
Just threw together a few dishes,

240
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:28,880
tossed them in the pot,

241
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,840
and they turned out delicious.

242
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,240
Don't be mad anymore.

243
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:51,840
Why do I feel like

244
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:53,560
the air is tense now?

245
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:56,240
My poor little heart

246
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:57,680
is trembling.

247
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:03,920
Comrade Ye Zhen,

248
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:06,440
can you do me a favour?

249
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,320
Smile and say to me,

250
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,840
"Honey, I'm not mad anymore."

251
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:16,280
Can you not be so childish?

252
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,280
Eat your food.

253
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,880
It wasn't that great to begin with.

254
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:20,880
It'll taste worse cold.

255
00:15:21,270 --> 00:15:22,870
You're fine like this. Really.

256
00:15:23,890 --> 00:15:25,240
It feels much better now.

257
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:31,440
How's your injury?

258
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,440
Still hurting?

259
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:33,760
It stopped hurting ages ago.

260
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:43,760
Ye Zhen,

261
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:47,560
actually, I've always wanted

262
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:50,520
to have an honest talk with you.

263
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,960
Don't put so much pressure on yourself.

264
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,760
About what happened back then,

265
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:02,960
you weren't responsible.

266
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:05,680
It was my fault.

267
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:08,560
If those people weren't out to get me,

268
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:10,880
Xing...

269
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,280
Alright, let's drop it.

270
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:19,350
Let's eat.

271
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:24,610
Have some soup.

272
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:45,640
Nana,

273
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:47,240
you've had a tough time lately.

274
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:49,320
You haven't even soaked your feet.

275
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,760
Here, come.

276
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:53,200
Thank you, my dear husband.

277
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:55,440
Is the water hot?

278
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:56,800
The temperature's perfect.

279
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:08,760
Look,

280
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:10,200
the baby's smiling at us.

281
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,880
So adorable.

282
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:20,280
Zhongliang.

283
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:23,720
Since we got back from the hospital,

284
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:25,720
you haven't really held the baby much.

285
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:27,200
I'm all clumsy.

286
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,280
I'm afraid I'll hurt him.

287
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:29,960
Are you silly?

288
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:31,760
He's your child.

289
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,840
Your hands will know how to be gentle.

290
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,080
It's instinct.

291
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:37,480
Let me do it myself.

292
00:17:37,730 --> 00:17:39,160
You go play with the baby.

293
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,240
Look at him.

294
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:42,160
He's so cute.

295
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,760
Have you seen a white car?

296
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,200
No, we haven't.

297
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:18,840
Did you see someone carrying a baby?

298
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:20,240
- Did you?
- No, no, no.

299
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:25,360
Luo Zhongliang?

300
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:27,480
Stop the car.

301
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:39,000
Luo Zhongliang, what's going on?

302
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:47,000
Give me the baby! Give me the baby!

303
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,560
Give me the baby! Give...

304
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:53,760
Give me the baby!

305
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,560

driving a white Jinbei van.

All departments, set up checkpoints.

312
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:28,360
Any updates?

Captain, nothing found.

314
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,080

The Jinbei van with plate ending 873
isn't registered locally.

317
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:41,840
It's a cloned plate.

We found the car, but it's empty.

in Dongmin Third Alley.

I'll send the surveillance footage now.

Captain Ye, there's only footage
from the entrance and exit.

No one passed during that time.

inside the alley.

00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:11,200
Where's the baby?

378
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:12,440
I'm sorry, Nana.

379
00:26:12,790 --> 00:26:13,640
You was asleep earlier,

380
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:15,280
and I didn't want to wake you.

381
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:17,240
So I took the baby out for his shot.

382
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:18,880
But as soon as we went out, a woman

383
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:19,920
started talking to me.

384
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:20,800
While we were talking,

385
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,520
she suddenly snatched the baby.

386
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,280
Nana.

387
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,520
Nana, Nana!

388
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,200
It's all my fault.

389
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:30,760
It's all my fault, all my fault!

390
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,480
Why did I go out today?

391
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:35,760
If I hadn't gone out,

392
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:36,720
the baby wouldn't be missing.

393
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:40,400
Zhongliang.

394
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:42,080
Nana.

395
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:44,680
Nana, don't worry.

396
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:45,600
Don't worry, Nana.

397
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:47,760
Our baby will be okay.

398
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:49,120
I've already told the police.

399
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:51,200
They will definitely help us find the baby.

400
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:54,200
Nana.

401
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:11,400
Where did the boxes go?

402
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:14,360
Right before these two officers arrived,

403
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:15,320
they were just taken

404
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:16,480
to the recycling station.

405
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:17,600
Who took them?

406
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:18,670
My son.

407
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:19,800
Call him right now.

408
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:20,640
Tell him to stop.

409
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,040
There's a baby inside the box!

410
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:23,240
Hurry!

411
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:24,160
Okay, okay!

412
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:36,140
(Dad)

413
00:27:38,180 --> 00:27:39,600
He left it at the house.

414
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:45,640
See? He didn't take the phone.

415
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:46,840
Where's the garbage going?

416
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:48,560
To the waste plant on Sanhuan Road.

417
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:51,560
Hurry! Garbage plant on Sanhuan Road!

418
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:03,800
Luo, contact the waste plant.

419
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:04,800
Tell them to stop

420
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:07,400
a garbage truck with plate HAC66741.

421
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:08,520
There's a baby on the truck.

422
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:09,600
Okay, got it.

423
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:17,620
(Yicheng Waste Treatment Plant)

424
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:21,720
Why are you here today? Where's your dad?

425
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:23,000
My dad has a backache.

426
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,080
A backache?

427
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:26,640
- Thanks, sir.
- Go ahead.

428
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:32,380
(Yicheng Waste Treatment Plant)

429
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:44,750
Hello?

430
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:46,240
Director?

431
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:47,800
What's going on?

432
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:49,880
He just went in.

433
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:52,000
Okay, okay.

434
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:54,800
Xie, stop the car.

435
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:56,640
Stop the car!

436
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:07,160
Garbage truck
with plate 66741 here yet?

437
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:08,080
It's here inside.

438
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:19,400
Stop!

439
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:21,520
Stop!

440
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:33,240
Turn off the engine!

441
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:46,440
Careful.

442
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:47,400
Careful with the baby.

443
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:49,920
How's the baby?

444
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:51,920
The baby's fine.

445
00:29:59,790 --> 00:30:00,640
Thank you.

446
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:03,680
(Lanling Police Station)
Thank you, thank you.

447
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:12,520
Captain, why did that person
steal my child?

448
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:13,800
Who is he?

449
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:15,120
We don't know.

450
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:16,880
He was hit by a car while running away

451
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,000
and died on the spot.

452
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:27,640
Nana, wake up!

453
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:30,440
Luo Zhongliang, calm down.
They both need you now.

454
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:31,480
I don't care!

455
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:33,760
If something happens to Nana,

456
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:35,890
he won't live either!

457
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:37,360
Nana.

458
00:31:09,130 --> 00:31:10,160
Zhongliang.

459
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:12,920
Look how cute the baby is.

460
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:16,600
When will he grow up

461
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:18,120
and call me mom?

462
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,120
The baby is here.

463
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:09,880
Your son is crying
and you're not doing anything?

464
00:32:12,890 --> 00:32:13,890
He's not!

465
00:32:23,750 --> 00:32:24,630
What did you say?

466
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:31,320
Nana.

467
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:36,720
If you send this love child away,

468
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,280
if you can still

469
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:41,280
live a peaceful life with me,

470
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:44,960
I'll pretend you never cheated on me.

471
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:55,160
The baby is a love child?

472
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:58,720
Whose love child?

473
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:00,920
Luo Zhongliang.

474
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:02,160
Don't think I don't know

475
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:03,840
you have a problem.

476
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:06,200
You're dark and selfish,

477
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:07,760
and petty.

478
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:10,880
I've been tolerating your flaws
all this time.

479
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:24,720
You finally spoke the truth.

480
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:27,480
I know

481
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:32,360
you've always looked down on me.

482
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:36,380
I'm not good enough for you.

483
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:41,620
I have no money, no ability.

484
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:46,900
Even the rent

485
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:49,900
was paid by your parents.

486
00:33:56,380 --> 00:33:57,780
Tell me the truth.

487
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:01,900
Have you been with Wang Shuai

488
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:05,020
for a long time?

489
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:18,820
Li Na, what are you doing?

490
00:34:18,820 --> 00:34:19,700
Get down! Get down!

491
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:21,140
- Manager.
- Come, come.

492
00:34:21,420 --> 00:34:22,260
What do you want?

493
00:34:22,270 --> 00:34:23,300
Let me do it for you.

494
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:24,980
Thanks, manager, I'm fine.

495
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:27,340
Oh, I'll transfer
the money to you shortly.

496
00:34:30,460 --> 00:34:32,540
We can't do this again.

497
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:34,940
If we get caught, we'll be jailed.

498
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:36,180
I know, I know.

499
00:34:36,180 --> 00:34:37,100
I'll send you the money.

500
00:34:37,380 --> 00:34:38,260
Please deposit it quickly

501
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:39,620
and fill that hole.

502
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:41,380
Don't worry.

503
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:10,460
(Policewoman's Mini-Class)

504
00:35:10,540 --> 00:35:12,460
(Policewoman's Mini-Class)
Officer, may I ask a question?

505
00:35:12,570 --> 00:35:13,550
Sure.

506
00:35:13,550 --> 00:35:15,580
Why do you always make criminals squat

507
00:35:15,590 --> 00:35:17,160
when you catch them?

508
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:18,320
You try it.

509
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:22,300
Like this?

510
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:23,220
Hands on your head.

511
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:25,500
No handcuffs?

512
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:26,620
What if I run away?

513
00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:29,020
Now you understand

514
00:35:29,020 --> 00:35:30,420
why we make you squat.

515
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:33,010
