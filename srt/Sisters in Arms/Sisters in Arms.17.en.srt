You must want something,

26
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,660
taking such a big risk to save me.

27
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:52,960
Do you recognize me?

28
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:02,880
Let me introduce myself.

00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:05,640
My name is Wu.

30

Come on,

36
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,720
we're at Officer Liu's place for dinner.

37
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:42,640

What are you guys eating?

39
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,680
Hurry up, you two.

40
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:52,720
I'm starving.

41
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:53,880
Almost done. Don't worry.

42
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:55,360
It depends on her skills.

43
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:56,320
Almost ready!

44
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,360
Are we gonna get to eat?

45
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:00,640

her signature spicy crayfish.

51
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:20,080
I'll record a video for you.

52
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:23,680
Here.

53
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,640
Help me hold this one.

54
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:26,880
Lift it up for me.

55
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,920
So it's easier for me to...

56
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,320
Use the hand...

57
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,600
Piece of cake.

58
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,560
It'll be ready soon.

59
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,280
Why are you shaking?

60
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,200
I'm not shaking.

61
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,480
Can you handle it or not?

62
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,080
Say hi to Yun'er.

63
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,360
Hello.

64
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:49,760
Hello.

65
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:50,880
It's crayfish.

66
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,760
Wait a minute.

67
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:53,640
Hold it tight.

68
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:54,920
Hold its claw.

69
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:58,080
What?

70
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,240
Nothing.

71
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,320
Wait, uh...

72
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,040
Let's order takeaway.

73
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,880
Can you stop being so jumpy?

74
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:06,260
- Look at this mess.
- Look at you.

75
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:08,640
Maybe we won't have dinner tonight.

76
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:09,600
You're always like this.

77
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,140
- I know, I know.
- Just order first.

78
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:12,310
- Watch it.
- Unbelievable.

79
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,280
Dinner's not happening.

80
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,240
Why are you yelling?

81
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,520
- You scared me.
- What's going on?

82
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:24,640
Takeaway's ordered.

83
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,800
Forget it, forget it. I...

84
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:28,720
I give up.

85
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:30,760
We already ordered takeout.

86
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:33,920
Guess we won't be having
Officer Mai's crayfish today.

87
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,360
Blew the act, huh?

88
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,640
What kind of cooking is that?

89
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:44,280
You guys are hopeless.

90
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:46,480

91
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:47,680
Mom.

92
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,400
What's got you laughing?

93
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:52,040
I'm watching Tata's video.

94
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Officer An?

95
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,520
You seem to really like Officer An.

96
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:00,880
Yeah.

97
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:02,760
She's really strong.

98
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:04,360
And she's very kind to me.

99
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:05,880
Mom.

100
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:08,680
Don't you think we're are alike?

101
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,600
Fang Fang went to university.

102
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:20,080
You should make more friends.

103
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:23,320
Besides Officer An,

104
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,790
there's also Captain Ye and the others.

105
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:26,680
You can spend more time with them.

106
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:28,720
After all, to rescue you,

107
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:30,600
everyone worked really hard.

108
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:35,200
Oh right, Mom.

109
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:36,800
Come to think of it,

110
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,040
I don't think I've properly
thanked them yet.

111
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:43,840
How about this,

112
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:47,120
invite Captain Ye and Officer An

113
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,030
to our studio for a experience session.

114
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:50,290
How about that?

115
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:52,600
Sure.

116
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:53,440
Thanks, Mom.

(Emergency Response Training Base)

118
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:19,900
Thank you.

119
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:57,760
Are you okay?

120
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,840
That was an accident.

121
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:05,400
I know.

122
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,240
I heard you studied martial arts.

123
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:09,760
No.

124
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,600
I grew up in Guangdong,

125
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,960
so I picked up some basic moves.

126
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:15,520
You're being modest.

127
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:16,560
I've heard about it.

128
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:18,040
Hummer Commandos each have a specialty.

129
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,760
Besides martial arts,
you also know medicine.

130
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:22,480
No, no.

131
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,360
My dad's a traditional
Chinese medicine doctor.

132
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,320
I'm just an amateur.

133
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,840
But he influenced me a lot.

134
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:32,360
I can use that knowledge
to make facial masks,

135
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,760
or foot soak bags.

136
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,640
That sounds practical.

137
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,640
Yeah! I'm serious.

138
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,400
Take face masks for example,

139
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:41,920
use angelica,

140
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,760
atractylodes rhizome, white peony, ginkgo.

141
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:46,080
80% of such herbs

142
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,400
have whitening effect.

143
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,760
And if your skin is dry
and needs hydration,

144
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:54,000
try aloe vera and seaweed.

145
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,480
Blend them together,

146
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:56,800
and it'll be very hydrated.

147
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,080
Seriously!

148
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:00,580
Try it sometime, your skin looks dry.

149
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:02,400
Alright.

150
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,320
Thanks.

151
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:21,360
I'm the one who's smitten.

152
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:23,480
Who is it?

153
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,040
Well, this person

154
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,280
is really tall,

155
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:27,840
kind of handsome too.

156
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:28,840
Not only is he handsome,

157
00:10:29,090 --> 00:10:30,400
he's agile too,

158
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:31,760
and super gentlemanly.

159
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:46,760
What is this place?

160
00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:51,320
Life and money depend on this place.

161
00:11:53,570 --> 00:11:55,200
What can a broken mine even do?

162
00:11:58,880 --> 00:11:59,800
Transport goods.

Raw materials

166
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:32,920
and equipment.

167
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,280
I can get anything you need.

168
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:39,000
If you're in, you're mine from now on.

169
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:40,640
If not,

170
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:42,400
pay back what you owe me,

171
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:44,080
and we're even.

172
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:46,680
What do I owe you?

173
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:50,640
Your life.

Where did Mai go?

176
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,600
She went to watch the Raptors' training,

177
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:19,720
said she wanted to observe.

178
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:27,720
The quarterly assessment is soon.

179
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,120
Everyone, get changed

180
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:31,320
and warmed up quickly.

181
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:32,720
Do your best out there.

182
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:33,960
I believe in you all.

183

- Go for it!
- Go for it!

184
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,280
- Come on!
- We got this!

185
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:42,600
Have you noticed?

186
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:45,010
Captain's been
in a pretty good mood lately.

187
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:46,790
Right?

188
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:02,960
Get up.

189
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:08,720
There's Mai.

190
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,160
She's infiltrated the Raptors.

191
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:14,480
They kind of

192
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,040
look like a couple, right?

193
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:18,560
Song Tiancheng is pretty handsome.

194
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,060
And our Mai's gorgeous too.

195
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:22,440
Looking good.

196
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:23,360
It's nice.

197
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,000
Danyang.

198
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:16,640
Danyang.

199
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:18,200
Are you okay?

200
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:23,200
What's wrong?

201
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:31,960
Liu Danyang,

202
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,160
what's with you today?

203
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:34,320
You're acting so weird.

204
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:36,200
Nothing.

205
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,280
Did I do something to upset you?

206
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,040
Bad scores.

207
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:41,080
I'm just annoyed.

208
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:43,560
Don't be upset, Danyang.

209
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:44,480
I'm the lowest scorer.

210
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:46,640
Come on, you guys, cheer up.

211
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,440
Didn't Captain say

212
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:50,160
everyone's improved this time?

213
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:51,480
Right, Danyang?

214
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:52,600
She's very pleased.

215
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:54,400
You mean you're pleased.

216
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:58,280
What's that supposed to mean?

217
00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:59,160
Comrades,

218
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:01,520
since we've given half a day off,

219
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:03,480
let's relax a bit

220
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:04,630
and treat ourselves.

221
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:05,840
How about it?

222
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:08,400
My treat.

223
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:09,800
We're going for a big feast?

224
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,720
But isn't Danyang on a diet lately?

225
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:17,120
Big feast?

226
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,040
So cliché.

227
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:19,440
How about we go

228
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:21,520
for beauty treatment?

229
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:26,760
I've never been to a beauty salon.

230
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:27,640
That's perfect then.

231
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:28,880
I've never been either.

232
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:31,440
Actually,

233
00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:33,960
it's Yun'er who's been
wanting to invite us

234
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,440
to her mom's studio.

235
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,840
Now we all have time,

236
00:16:36,950 --> 00:16:38,340
let's just go together.

237
00:16:39,370 --> 00:16:40,360
But

238
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:42,290
is that really okay?

239
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:43,600
What's wrong?

240
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:45,520
We'll pay full price.

241
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:46,760
No freebies.

242
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:48,200
And also,

243
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:49,520
it's a legitimate place.

244
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:50,720
No worries.

245
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,520
Fine by me.

246
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:53,960
But we'll pay ourselves.

247
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,160
Can't let you treat us.

248
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:56,400
Yeah, right.

249
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,000
This time, it's on me.

250
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:58,920
No arguments.

251
00:16:59,230 --> 00:17:00,090
How about it?

252
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:01,880
- Let's go together.
- Yeah.

253
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:03,400
- Let's go.
- Yeah, let's go.

254
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:04,320
Let's go.

255
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:15,360
What's up?

256
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:17,880
I think I'll skip it.

257
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:21,960
Come on, Danyang.

258
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:23,360
Look at you,

259
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:25,240
have you been training too hard?

260
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:26,520
You've got sunspots.

261
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:28,200
I don't care

262
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,120
about sunspots.

263
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:30,600
Forget it.

264
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:32,400
Don't push her.

265
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,760
Our Danyang

266
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:36,200
has never liked
this kind of stuff, right,

267
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,120
Danyang?

268
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,680
Who says I don't like it?

269
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,080
I'm going.

270
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:47,680
Ms. Chen,

271
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:50,360
if you like it, let me know.

272
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:51,760
I'll save more for you next time.

273
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:52,680
Great.

274
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:54,160
It's a new formula.

275
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:55,780
You're gonna love it.

276
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:56,630
Okay.

277
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:01,000
Sorry, ma'am.

278
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:01,920
It's fine.

279
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,760
Yun'er, what are you doing?

280
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,480
Some friends of mine
are here for facials.

281
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:06,360
Who?

282
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:07,280
An Tata

283
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:09,040
and the SWAT members.

284
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:18,440
Ms. Chen, sorry.

285
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:20,800
Tata, you finally made it!

286
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,000
Hello!

287
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,960
Everything's arranged for you today.

288
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,200
- You're here!
- Hello.

289
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:27,520
You all made it.

290
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:28,440
Sorry for the trouble.

291
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:29,800
Yun'er has been waiting for you.

292
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:30,760
Come on in!

293
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:32,480
- Let's go, this way.
- Come on in!

294
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,500
I've arranged skin boosters

295
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:35,840
(¥3,800)
for you.

296
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:38,080
- Quick, get inside.
- Right this way.

297
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:39,080
And also

298
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:40,200
- hydration.
- Ms. Ai Lian.

299
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:41,400
You go ahead.

300
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,400
I'll clean this up.

301
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:44,880
No need, go get things ready.

302
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,600
Cut some fruit, make some tea.

303
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:47,560
Hurry along now.

304
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:48,480
- Go on!
- Okay!

305
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:49,400
Go, go.

306
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:35,600
How long will it take?

307
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:36,960
I really can't stay lying here.

308
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,120
Can I turn over? This is exhausting.

309
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,000
Of course not.

310
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:42,000
Try this.

311
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,160
Lift your legs

312
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:45,040
and stretch them out. Might feel better.

313
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:48,160
Why does this feel more
tiring than training?

314
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,600
Hang in there, it's all for beauty.

315
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:52,240
No pain, no gain.

316
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:55,090
That's what we say
when we're in horse stance.

317
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:58,080
Sorry, Tata,

318
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,500
I wanted you all to relax.

319
00:20:00,770 --> 00:20:02,670
Didn't expect this to feel like torture.

320
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:05,180
Don't listen to them.

321
00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:06,770
We're usually

322
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,880
under a lot of pressure
and super active.

323
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:10,920
Lying still like this

324
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:12,230
might be a bit uncomfortable.

325
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:14,240
Besides,

326
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,910
they're just complaining for fun.

327
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,640
Actually, they're loving it. Right?

328
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:18,510
Exactly!

329
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:20,680
We're totally enjoying this.

330
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,200
Don't take it to heart.

331
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:23,580
I really envy you guys.

332
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:25,880
You can work

333
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:27,600
and have fun together.

334
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:28,640
Of course!

335
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:31,200
We eat, live,
and train together every day.

336
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,520
There are no secrets between us.

337
00:20:32,930 --> 00:20:34,080
Naturally we're close.

338
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,290
What, Liu Danyang?

339
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:39,330
Why are you acting weird?

340
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:41,230
You're the weird one, Mai Jialing.

341
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:43,840
What did I do to you?

342
00:20:44,390 --> 00:20:45,520
You didn't do anything.

343
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:47,030
I'm just messed up, okay?

344
00:20:47,050 --> 00:20:48,320
Yeah, you are messed up.

345
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:50,830
- Are they fighting?
- You're the one who's messed up!

346
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:52,280
Nope.

347
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:55,040
They're always bickering like this.

348
00:20:58,720 --> 00:20:59,640
So nice.

349
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,240
When I get upset,

350
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:02,480
I never lash out.

351
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,640
I just bottle it all up.

352
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:05,840
Don't bottle it up.

353
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,920
That can make you sick.

354
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:09,880
If anything's bothering you,

355
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,000
and if you feel sad,

356
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:12,160
just come talk to us.

357
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:13,120
When people gather

358
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:15,080
and open their hearts,

359
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:16,560
things start to make sense.

360
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:18,800
Wouldn't that be inconvenient for you?

361
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:20,360
Not at all.

362
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:21,640
After work,

363
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,300
we're just regular people.

364
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:25,520
Then it's a deal.

365
00:21:25,770 --> 00:21:27,600
Don't get annoyed with me later.

366
00:21:28,410 --> 00:21:29,640
Why would we?

367
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:32,640
You're always welcome.

368
00:21:37,090 --> 00:21:38,920
Oh right, though we're friends,

369
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:40,800
we should pay for the beauty treatments.

370
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:41,720
Got it.

371
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:43,360
I won't let you break the rules.

372
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:46,560
Tata,

373
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,400
I'm really glad

374
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:52,000
you all came.

375
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,080
I never imagined

376
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:57,640
I'd become friends with you.

377
00:21:58,760 --> 00:21:59,680
It must be fate.

378
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:01,880
I want

379
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,200
to make peace with my past

380
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:05,040
and with myself,

381
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:06,880
and look forward.

382
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,280
Thank you, Tata.

383
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:10,640

(Huaiyang: Waiting for you to come home)

405
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,160
- Well?
- Captain Zhu.

406
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:17,080
Any leads?

407
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:18,030
No.

408
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:19,800
Chen and I checked nearby surveillance.

409
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:21,440
Nothing suspicious turned up.

410
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,200
He's disappeared again.

411
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,240
Give me all the current case files.

412
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:39,440
I'm hungry.

413
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:41,680
Then go eat.

414
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:42,720
Come with us.

415
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:44,040
I'll pass.

416
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:45,120
I'll bring you something.

417
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:47,200
I don't want your junk food.

418
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,340
- Let's go then.
- Come on.

419
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:01,140
(Waiting for you to come home)

420
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:56,920
Dear Xing,

421
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,360
Daddy misses you so much.

422
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:04,680
Do you know how I felt

423
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:06,960
the first time I saw you?

424
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,240
You were so tiny,

425
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:12,360
yet so strong,

426
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:15,560
carrying all your mom and dad's hopes.

427
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:20,360
My little angel,

428
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:24,400
you really are a little star, right?

429
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:27,360
You flew down to see us,

430
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:29,120
then flew away again.

431
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:31,880
Isn't that so?

432
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:36,680
Thank you for coming.

433
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:38,120
Six months and 21 days

434
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:39,600
of your existence.

435
00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:40,960
Though it's short,

436
00:26:41,990 --> 00:26:43,880
but I will never forget.

437
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:46,880
I miss you,

438
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:49,240
but I'm learning

439
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:50,960
not to be greedy

440
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:53,040
and cling too tightly.

441
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:56,960
I hope you're happy up there too.

442
00:26:58,560 --> 00:26:59,760
Xing,

443
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,240
please watch over Mommy.

444
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:04,680
She's really heartbroken.

445
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:11,360
Dear Xing,

446
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,880
your third birthday is here.

447
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,040
But I've decided

448
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:20,080
to say goodbye to you now.

449
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:24,280
You understand,

450
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,320
don't you?

451
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:30,240
The longing is too heavy.

452
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:32,470
It keeps us from moving on.

453
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:36,240
Your mom can comfort anyone,

454
00:27:36,510 --> 00:27:38,240
but not herself.

455
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:39,760
But we have to

456
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,720
get through this hurdle.

457
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:44,480
I will help Mommy through it.

458
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:46,680
And you have to help us too,

459
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:48,880
giving us strength.

460
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:51,520
In the end,

461
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:54,440
we will meet again.

462
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:00,000
I miss you.

463
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,120
I love you.

464
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:05,280
I'll always remember you.

465
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:29,320
That's all your car's worth anyway.

466
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:30,360
Want me to transfer it now?

467
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:31,760
Here.

468
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:37,600
Just transferred it.

469
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:41,660
(Wallet)

470
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:54,520
A year ago,

471
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:56,640
our store's performance

472
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:58,880
was at the bottom of the company.

473
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:01,880
But this year,

474
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:04,240
we've made it to the top five

475
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:06,440
thanks to each of your effort.

476
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:08,920
Let's give ourselves
a round of applause.

477
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:11,640
Sorry, Manager.

478
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:13,480
Manager, traffic was really bad.

479
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:18,600
Next,

480
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:19,760
I want to recognize

481
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:21,800
our outstanding team of the month.

482
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:24,520
This month's top team

483
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:26,360
is still Team One.

484
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:28,960
According to our reward system,

485
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:30,640
all Team One members

486
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:34,000
will receive a 15% bonus
on their salaries.

487
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:35,560
Let's congratulate them!

488
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:38,960
Manager, Manager Zhou.

489
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:41,400
Our team's performance

490
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:42,560
was the same as Team One's.

491
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:44,440
Why didn't we get rewarded?

492
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:46,880
The evaluation criteria

493
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,360
aren't just about performance.

494
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,040
There's also attendance.

495
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:52,000
Remember,

496
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:53,560
everyone

497
00:31:53,730 --> 00:31:55,200
is part of the team.

498
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:57,360
A disorganized team

499
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:00,440
can't perform efficiently.

500
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:02,440
Each of you should have

501
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:04,360
a little alarm bell inside you.

502
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:06,960
And I'm the one ringing that bell.

503
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:10,840
Alright, that's it for today's meeting.

504
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:11,840
Dismiss.

505
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:14,080
Manager Zhou,

506
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:15,520
that's a bit harsh.

507
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:16,920
I was only late a few times.

508
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:18,440
Now you're putting me in a tough spot.

509
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:21,640
But it's true

510
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:23,160
that you dragged the team down.

511
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:24,840
You should reflect on that,

512
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:27,120
not come blaming me.

513
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:28,880
I have the highest personal sales

514
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:29,800
in the entire store.

515
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:31,560
You're clearly targeting me.

516
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:33,160
Why would I target you?

517
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:34,280
Company rules

518
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:35,320
are clearly written.

519
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:36,520
Can't you read?

520
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:38,600
Ma,

521
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:40,120
if your standards for yourself

522
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:41,080
are that low,

523
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:42,080
then I think

524
00:32:42,330 --> 00:32:44,010
you're not fit for my team.

525
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:46,360
I suggest you
write a resignation letter.

526
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:48,720
- Come on, Zhou.
- If you don't want to resign,

527
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:50,560
then let me be clear.

528
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:51,720
This month,

529
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:53,080
you were late three times,

530
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:54,040
and left early once.

531
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:57,440
Finance will deduct
the penalties accordingly.

532
00:32:58,720 --> 00:32:59,760
Got it?

533
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:02,160
Dock my pay.

534
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:03,760
You slave driver.

535
00:33:05,850 --> 00:33:06,760
Officer, help me!

536
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:07,680
Stop!

537
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:09,600
Calm down.

538
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:10,920
We can talk.

539
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:12,200
I've got nothing to say to you.

540
00:33:18,870 --> 00:33:21,350
You sound a bit flustered.

541
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:26,640
What makes you think I'm flustered?

542
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:28,520
I can obviously tell.

543
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:29,760
I know you well.

544
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:30,800
Liu Danyang,

545
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:32,360
watch your emotional control.

546
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:33,800
We're negotiating

547
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:35,400
to understand their real demands

548
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:36,920
and rescue the hostage.

549
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:38,880
I know what he wants.

550
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:42,680
Why couldn't you
just talk to me directly?

551
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:44,360
Why couldn't you express your needs?

552
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:47,040
You're forcing me right now.

553
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:47,960
Yes.

554
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:49,280
I am forcing you.

555
00:33:51,290 --> 00:33:52,320
If you kill her,

556
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:53,800
what good does it do you?

557
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:54,950
You'll still go to prison.

558
00:33:57,290 --> 00:33:59,560
You're only hurting
both of you this way.

559
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:01,680
What about my conditions?

560
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:02,600
Time's up.

561
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:05,520
You didn't pass.

562
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:14,520
Danyang, what's wrong?

563
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:15,920
Are you too nervous?

564
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:18,480
Should we tell Captain and try again?

565
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:21,720
Alright.

566
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:22,800
Let's try again.

567
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:24,060
You got this.

568
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:34,300
Tang Xin, get ready.

569
00:34:35,620 --> 00:34:36,540
What's wrong?

570
00:34:38,180 --> 00:34:39,100
It's fine.

571
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:43,260
Good then.

573
00:34:55,210 --> 00:34:56,720
(Policewoman's Mini-Class)
We are cops

574
00:34:56,900 --> 00:34:59,300
but also human beings.

575
00:34:59,570 --> 00:35:00,430
We're parents,

576
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:01,390
children,

577
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:02,300
and spouses.

578
00:35:02,770 --> 00:35:05,020
We also feel tired, scared,
and yearning.

579
00:35:05,490 --> 00:35:06,860
But because we wear this uniform,

580
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:09,340
we must charge into danger.

581
00:35:09,850 --> 00:35:11,060
It's our mission

582
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:12,540
and our duty.
