00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,760
I heard you're doing extra training.

25
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,480
Are you meditating here?

26
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,200
Yes.

27
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:02,440
Why are you talking to me now?

28
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:03,880
Are we not in a cold war anymore?

29
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:15,480
What's going on with you?

30
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:17,040
Why are you upset?

31
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,960
We could just talk it through, right?

32
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,880
You don't know

33
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:23,920
how frustrating this is for me.

34
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,320
You really think

35
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,600
I'm upset with you

36
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,240
because my grades
are worse than yours?

37
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,080
I don't think so.

38
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:43,640
After all, you're not that ambitious.

39
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:52,000
What's really going on?

40
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:52,920
Tell me.

41
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,160
Come on.

42
00:02:58,760 --> 00:02:59,680
Mai.

43
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,360
We're such good friends

44
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,560
that we even have the same taste.

45
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:06,280
Isn't it annoying?

46
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:09,480
What do you mean?

47
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:15,720
Mai.

48
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,360
You're beautiful,

49
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,840
with high emotional intelligence,
great abilities,

50
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,480
and you even know medicine.

51
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,280
You're better than me at everything.

52
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,480
If it were me,

53
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,680
I would pick you.

54
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,360
What are you saying?

55
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,080
I know who you have a crush on.

56
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,880
It's Song Tiancheng, right?

57
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:40,080
Song Tiancheng?

58
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,440
You also like Song Tiancheng?

59
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,880
You do like Song Tiancheng.

60
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:58,440
Liu Danyang, even you have a crush!

61
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,840
A once-in-a-moon event!

62
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,440
Why can't I like someone?

63
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:02,840
I'm good enough too, you know?

64
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,480
Yes, that's true.

65
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:08,960
You are indeed very excellent.

66
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:12,960
But unfortunately,

67
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,000
you don't have a chance anymore.

68
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:25,180
(Song Tiancheng)

69
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,640
Song Tiancheng got married?

70
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:29,960
Yes.

71
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:31,560
The bride isn't us.

72
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,710
I was just alone

73
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:35,280
thinking about this matter.

74
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,680
My bestie,

75
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:39,400
you have to share the pain together.

76
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,160
You keep it for meditation.

77
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,040
I'm feeling better.

78
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,140
Thanks, bye.

79
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:49,040
- Liu Danyang has a crush!
- Mai Jialing, get back here!

80
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,240
Come back here!

81
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:52,080
I'm telling you, if anything happens,

82
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,560
don't tell me!

83
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,200
Yuan Bin.

84
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,000
All criminals

85
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
find an excuse for themselves.

86
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:11,000
It's all because of your greed
that this happened.

87
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,800
If everyone in society

88
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,360
walked to extremes like you

89
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,720
and broke the law,

90
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,320
the consequences would be unimaginable.

91
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,680
I hope you can truly repent

92
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:23,800
and reform

93
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:25,360
to get out soon.

94
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:33,560
Can I go see my mom again?

95
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,680
I've been a burden to you.

96
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,400
Now let's talk about

97
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,080
the hostage situation the other day.

98
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,520
Danyang.

99
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:55,600
I remember criminology talked about

100
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,000
the psychology of hostage-takers.

101
00:05:57,290 --> 00:05:58,880
It's either in uncontrollable rage

102
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,380
or scornful of everything.

103
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:03,880
So we need to use humanitarianism
to change their mindset.

104
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,520
Very well.

105
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,920
But it's all just theory.

106
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,520
We need to adjust
based on the actual situation.

107
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:17,120
Yuan Bin was a juvenile offender.

108
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:20,480
After rehabilitation, he worked hard

109
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,280
and became an accountant.

110
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,160
He was fired
because of his past blemish,

111
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:27,000
so he must hate those

112
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:27,960
who deny his efforts.

113
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,600
So

114
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,440
we need to shift Yuan Bin's attention

115
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,680
away from Manager Zhou.

116
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:43,480
Pretty good.

117
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,120
Remember,

118
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,280
during the negotiation process,

119
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:53,200
we must always be aware
of the suspect's state of mind.

120
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,120
Once our words

121
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,680
don't resonate with him,

122
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:56,760
the suspect will easily

123
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:57,680
lose patience

124
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,700
and cease communication.

125
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,720
This could lead to mission failure.

126
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:04,600
By the way,

127
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:07,160
the donations for Yuan Bin's mother

128
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,600
have all been given to the hospital.

129
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:11,440
And I heard the donations
are still coming in.

130
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,320
Great.

131
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,040
Captain, goodbye.

132
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:32,680
Yuan Bin,

133
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,440
I'm here to tell you

134
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:37,520
Manager Zhou has signed
a letter of understanding

135
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,280
and has been writing to the court.

136
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,840
They are still working for your case.

137
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,120
Here's some good news.

138
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:51,480
The hospital has received donations
from all sectors of society.

139
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:54,080
Your mother's medical fees
are no longer an issue.

140
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,360
Don't worry.

141
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:02,760
This is a recent video of your mom.

142
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:04,600
Drink slowly. Don't choke.

143
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,240
Her health is stable.

144
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:07,240
Thank you.

145
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,920
It's no problem.

146
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,200
I'll peel an orange for you.

147
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,040
Where's Bin?

148
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:13,960
Bin?

149
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,760
He went on a business trip.

150
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:19,080
He told me to come
and help take care of you.

151
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,880
Bin is really impressive now.

152
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:24,600
Our boss at the head office

153
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,680
saw him once.

154
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,320
He said

155
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:29,760
that Bin is very hardworking,

156
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:32,540
and they are preparing to send him
for training at the head office.

157
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,080
Thanks for their care.

158
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:35,640
It's no problem.

159
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,240
It's because Bin did well.

160
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,520
Get more Vitamin C.

161
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,040
It's good for your health, right?

162
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:41,560
And your medical fees

163
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,040
have been taken concern.

164
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:43,880
No worries now.

165
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:44,900
You don't need to worry.

166
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,460
Right.

167
00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:48,280
Thanks for your help.

168
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:50,120
It's the least we could do.

169
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,480
Here, have another one.

170
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,000
Okay, thank you.

171
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:13,920
Sorry.

172
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,680
I'm leaving.

173
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:06,880
Pass.

174
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:13,440
Quick, quick, quick.

175
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,200
What happened?

176
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:17,520
What place is this?

177
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:19,560
Hello, where's my bestie outfit?

178
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:20,880
It's ready.

179
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,520
Here.

180
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,040
Tata.

181
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:28,400
How about this dress?

182
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,040
It looks pretty good.

183
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:31,400
It suits you.

184
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,480
Too bad it's a bestie outfit.

185
00:10:33,770 --> 00:10:34,800
Fang Fang isn't here.

186
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:37,440
Otherwise, she could wear it with me.

187
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:43,200
How about...

188
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,960
- This looks so good, Tata.
- You're killing me.

189
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:02,300
It looks great.

190
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:03,440
Here.

191
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,400
It's so ugly.

192
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,800
Delete it, delete it.

193
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,080
I'll go pay.

194
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:09,920
No.

195
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:10,960
Don't waste money.

196
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,320
I won't wear it.

197
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:14,400
Doesn't it look good?

198
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,400
I'll pick a few more for you.

199
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,600
No!

200
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:27,120
Hello, Mom. What's wrong?

201
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,120
Tata.

202
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,200
Coming back this week?

203
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:30,960
I'll be back tomorrow.

204
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,680
I'm out shopping with a friend.

205
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:34,430
Okay.

206
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:37,120
What's wrong, Mom?

207
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,040
Is something wrong?

208
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,160
It's nothing serious.

209
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:41,920
I just came to the hospital

210
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,560
to visit a friend.

211
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:45,080
And I saw your dad.

212
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,800
He was still in a hospital gown.

213
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,120
I don't know

214
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,040
what illness he has.

215
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:50,600
Do you think...

216
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:51,600
Mom.

217
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,840
I'll be home tomorrow at noon.

218
00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:53,690
Want something to eat?

219
00:11:53,710 --> 00:11:55,160
I'll bring it home for you, okay?

220
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:56,080
Anything's fine.

221
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,600
Go back to your things.

222
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,770
Come back early tomorrow.

223
00:11:58,770 --> 00:11:59,610
Okay.

224
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:09,000
These drugs were all

225
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,400
found in the trash bins.

226
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:12,920
(Binjiang Anti-narcotics Brigade)

227
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:15,400
According to those we arrested,

228
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,880
no one has ever contacted them directly.

229
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,480
They just set up meeting spots online,

230
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,120
and those spots are random.

231
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,240
Then they use a black plastic bag

232
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,680
to wrap the drugs

233
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,320
and leave them in the trash bins.

234
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:29,680
The composition of this batch

235
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,880
is exactly the same as
what we found with Xiahou Xiong.

236
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:33,800
Even the trafficking methods
are identical.

237
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:36,120
I also believe this batch

238
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:39,880
is the same batch
that Wu took previously.

239
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:42,440
So if it's Wu,

240
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:44,240
why has he been active again

241
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,920
after such a long time?

242
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:47,520
Because the supply is sufficient.

243
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,480
Or maybe

244
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:52,480
he found new sources.

245
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:54,560
It's possible.

246
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:55,800
No way.

247
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,400
I've blocked all his

248
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,600
foreign routes.

249
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:03,920
Is it possible they found someone

250
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:06,320
who can make the drugs

251
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:08,120
and set up a self-sustaining

252
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:10,120
production chain?

253
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:12,550
Is it possible that

254
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,360
Mad Dog is with him?

255
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,000
I think

256
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:19,480
the one who saved Mad Dog

257
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,600
must be Wu.

258
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,320
The goods are ready.

259
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,560
The purity absolutely reaches

260
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:35,700
the sample level you gave me.

261
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:43,520
Are the goods prepared?

262
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,320
Dove,

263
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:52,640
didn't you give out

264
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:54,520
a little trial sample?

265
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:56,920
Wu,

266
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:58,520
don't you trust me?

267
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:03,560
How could I not?

268
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:08,280
Well done.

269
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:15,840
Mad Dog.

270
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,120
His real name is Li Donghan.

271
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:19,280
Ten years ago, he entered
the Chemistry Department

272
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:20,680
at Ocean University
with top grades.

273
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:23,080
(Suspect Info: Li Donghan)
His professor mentioned

274
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:25,200
Li Donghan was very talented.

275
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:27,780
He was supposed to get into
graduate school through recommendation.

276
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,040
But they said

277
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,320
he had some personality issues.

278
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:31,680
While in college,

279
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:34,240
he got into a fight over
a small matter with his roommate

280
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,800
and injured his eye.

281
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:37,680
He was sent to detention,

282
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,520
then he fought with another inmate.

283
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:42,000
I think there are some issues with him.

284
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:45,440
According to testimonies
from people close to him

285
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,520
and the information we have,

286
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:50,280
we can confirm that he and Wu

287
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,000
are working together.

288
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,240
So,

289
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,760
our immediate priority

290
00:14:55,350 --> 00:14:57,120
is to move quickly

291
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,800
and locate their hideout.

292
00:14:59,000 --> 00:14:59,920
- Yes.
- Yes.

293
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:29,460
(Surveillance, Basement, Living Room)

294
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:35,820
(Fairy)

295
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:38,420
(Miss you)

296
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:01,540
(Police, Binjiang)

HAF45562.

298
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:14,640
HAF45562.

299
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:15,760
Stop, stop!

300
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,080
Mom.

301
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:24,160
Mom.

302
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,160
Kid.

303
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:27,680
Are you okay?

304
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:28,920
Come on, get up.

305
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:30,720
Where else does it hurt?

306
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:32,640
Let me see.

307
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:33,760
Okay, don't cry.

308
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:35,120
Does it hurt here?

309
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,240
Does your hand hurt?

310
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,200
Where does it hurt?

311
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,600
You guys are too careless.

312
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:40,210
We're really sorry.

313
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:42,050
- Thanks, officer.
- Thank you.

314
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:44,600
A child should always be in a car seat.

315
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:45,680
- Sure, sure.
- Okay, okay.

316
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:46,520
Thank you, thank you.

317
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:47,480
Be careful next time.

318
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:48,480
- Okay.
- Okay.

319
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:50,720
It's okay.

320
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:52,520
Return to the base.

321
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,280
I've never seen such careless parents.

322
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:01,760
They don't put their kid
in the car seat,

323
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:02,840
and they don't buckle up,

324
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:04,240
even leaving the car windows open.

325
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,840
There are parents
who are even more careless.

326
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:08,800
Remember last time?

327
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,600
We saw a young couple go out for a meal,

328
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:14,520
and they forgot their child
in the back seat.

329
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:16,280
The child cried loudly.

330
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:18,120
I'm quite speechless.

331
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:20,560
Who's born knowing how to be a parent?

332
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:22,000
It's their first time.

333
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,000
They're still young,

334
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,200
haven't gotten in the role yet.

335
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:27,360
Look, even our Tang Xin

336
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,400
knows this principle.

337
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:33,760
It's not about age.

338
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,600
Some people live their whole lives

339
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,280
and still don't know
what responsibility is.

340
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,440
How does she have so much energy?

341
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:10,440
Do you think

342
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:11,720
she doesn't get tired?

343
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:13,960
I don't understand.

344
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:28,960
The canteen has braised pork tonight.

345
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:30,400
Let's go.

346
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:32,320
Tata, keep practicing.

347
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:33,320
We're going to eat.

348
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:34,600
We're going for the meat.

349
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,000
Get me a portion.

350
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,160
Okay.

351
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:44,740
What are you looking at?

352
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:47,280
I really envy them.

353
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,600
They are always so happy.

354
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:52,040
It's like they never have any worries.

355
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,000
They definitely have worries,

356
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,160
but you know,

357
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,320
they have a gift

358
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:59,240
that we don't have.

359
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:02,920
What?

360
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:04,760
A big heart.

361
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:07,880
People should have

362
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,000
fast self-response abilities,

363
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,760
strong self-healing powers,

364
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:14,600
and selective forgetting abilities.

365
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:16,560
Not one less.

366
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:18,640
So,

367
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,800
those who only remember the good
and forget the bad

368
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:23,680
are the ones who are happiest.

369
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:33,040
Tell me.

370
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:34,660
What are you struggling with?

371
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:38,520
Nothing.

372
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:49,840
Actually, I've recently

373
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:52,880
figured a few things out.

374
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,080
I realized

375
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:08,760
as long as I can
let go of the criticism,

376
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:12,680
I will feel a sense of relief.

377
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:23,840
Try it.

378
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:35,120
Why are you still
playing on your phone?

379
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,240
Have you done your homework?

380
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,600
Xu Zifeng, I'm talking to you.

381
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:40,840
Can you hear me?

382
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:48,560
What are you doing? I'm playing!

383
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,040
Go do your homework first.

384
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,120
I have my own plans and schedule.

385
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:53,320
Don't try to manage me.

386
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:55,160
I'm your mom.
If I don't manage you, who will?

387
00:22:56,930 --> 00:22:58,440
- What's that attitude?
- You can see.

388
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:00,000
Where are you going?

389
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:00,920
Stifling in here.

390
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:01,800
I'm stepping out.

391
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:02,800
Don't go!

392
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:04,660
(Honey)

393
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:08,510
Hello?

394
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:15,240
You'd better not come back.

395
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:19,800
None of them are easy to deal with.

396
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:24,760
Qiang, let's go.

397
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:25,680
Let's go.

398
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:28,720
We said, it's all fake.

399
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:29,880
How many times do I have to say?

400
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:31,160
We're helping her.

401
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:32,720
You also need to help me.

402
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:33,930
We've grown up together.

403
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:35,840
After it's done,
I won't treat you unfairly.

404
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:37,400
Hurry up.

405
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:46,480
What are you doing?

406
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:47,830
- Help!
- Don't shout.

407
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:50,840
What are you guys doing?

408
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:51,920
Who are you?

409
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:53,520
Shut your mouth.

410
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:54,440
Get in the car.

411
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:55,760
- Get in the car.
- Hurry up.

412
00:24:05,660 --> 00:24:06,680
Officers.

413
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:08,280
- Something's wrong.
- What's going on?

414
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,400
They've kidnapped people!

415
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:10,800
Don't worry. Take your time.

416
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,640
I... I just saw a mother and daughter

417
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,000
being dragged into a car.

418
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,360
One of them was holding a knife.

419
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:19,360
Wanru, Mai, stay here
and find out what's going on.

420
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:20,640
Tang Xin, head to the crossroads.

421
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:21,600
Everyone else follow me.

422
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:22,440
- Yes.
- Yes.

423
00:24:22,450 --> 00:24:23,380
Attention, all departments.

424
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:24,240
At Shimen No. 1 Alley,

425
00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:25,200
two people were kidnapped.

426
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:27,000
They were forced into a white van.

427
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:28,960
We only saw part of the license plate.

428
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,640
The first three letters are HAF.

429
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:31,840
The last digit is 4.

430
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,960
Who are you?

431
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:44,240
What do you want?

432
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:50,820
Don't move.

433
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:52,040
Behave yourselves.

434
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:53,080
Behave.

435
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:54,640
Tie her up.

436
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:55,560
Hurry up.

437
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:58,240
Just do as you're told,

438
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:00,320
we won't hurt you.

439
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:01,480
Let her go.

440
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:02,560
She's just a child.

441
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:03,920
Please.

442
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:04,960
Shut up.

443
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,190
I'm sorry.

444
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:10,680
Come.

445
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:16,080
Captain.

446
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:18,040
According to the information provided,

447
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:20,500
the two people who were kidnapped
are mother and daughter.

448
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:21,680
The mother's name is Chen Lin,

449
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:22,760
the daughter's is Xu Zifeng.

450
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:25,680
It seems that the kidnappers
planned this.

451
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:26,880
Notify their family quickly.

452
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:27,880
And search their house.

453
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:29,160
Got it.

454
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:30,240
Yes.

455
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:32,380
(Integrated Police Communication System)

456
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:34,540
Captain Ye, we've spotted
the suspected vehicle.

457
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:36,960
The license plate is HAF22034.

458
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:39,280
It's heading south
on Libo Road in the east.

459
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:41,280
Captain, I remember that
south of Libo Road

460
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:42,240
is still under construction.

461
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:44,280
The surveillance system
isn't fully installed yet.

462
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:45,560
Requesting reinforcements.

463
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:46,960
Please send nearby
police quickly.

464
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,040
Okay.

465
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:11,000
Hey.

466
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:12,640
Hey.

467
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:15,800
It feels like things are getting worse.

468
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:17,240
How about

469
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:19,800
we let them go?

470
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:22,320
Fine.

471
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:23,560
We can let them go.

472
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,080
Let me ask you,

473
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:26,100
do you still want money?

474
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:29,640
Don't worry.

475
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:31,160
I have it under control.

476
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:45,360
Is anyone there?

477
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,240
Is anyone there?

478
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:06,160
Captain Ye, we've sent reinforcements

479
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:07,520
to surround the last known location

480
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:08,560
of the suspect's vehicle.

481
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:10,560
Their whereabouts now are still unclear.

482
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:13,080
Could they have left the area?

483
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:14,480
Given the time,

484
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:15,920
they shouldn't have driven too fast.

485
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:17,960
Where could they have gone?

486
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:20,280
Wanru,

487
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:21,800
do you have any updates?

488
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:23,040
Captain,

489
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:24,720
from what I know,

490
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:26,080
Chen Lin is unemployed.

491
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:29,240
Her husband works
as a technician in a factory.

492
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:30,280
Their income is low.

493
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:34,120
But from the site visit,
the house conditions seem decent.

494
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:35,800
It's cozy and warm.

495
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:38,360
We're still waiting for
her husband to come back.

496
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:57,320
What are you doing?

497
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:58,680
You must be Xu Zheng, right?

498
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,000
The main road without cameras

499
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,240
has already been blocked.

500
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:05,040
There are also police cars
searching nearby.

501
00:28:05,090 --> 00:28:05,960
If they

502
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:07,680
haven't left this area,

503
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:09,840
where could they go?

504
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,610
Is it possible they have

505
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:14,910
abandoned the car
or switched vehicles and hidden?

506
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:17,240
But the car can't just disappear.

507
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:20,380
(Parking Lot)

508
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:22,400
Stop the car.

509
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:26,780
(Parking Lot)

510
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:27,760
Xīn,

511
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,520
how many public parking lots are here?

512
00:28:30,650 --> 00:28:31,520
Four.

513
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:33,240
Which one can avoid cameras completely?

514
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,760
The one in Sinan Parking Lot.

515
00:28:36,990 --> 00:28:37,920
Let's go.

516
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:44,460
(Police, Binjiang)

517
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:51,460
(Vehicle Identification, Slow Down)

518
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:58,880
Listen.

519
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,480
We'll get out of the car soon.

520
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:01,680
If you dare run,

521
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:03,280
I'll stab her.

522
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:04,880
Got it?

523
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:07,400
Take her

524
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:08,320
to the front car.

525
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:14,160
Go.

526
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:26,680
Get out.

527
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:33,880
All units, attention.

528
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:35,000
The suspect's vehicle

529
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,400
has entered Sinan Parking Lot.

530
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:57,720
You... You mean

531
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:59,200
my wife and child have been kidnapped?

532
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:01,080
Have you offended anyone recently?

533
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:04,600
Offended anyone?

534
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:07,080
No, we haven't.

535
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:09,360
Have you noticed anything unusual?

536
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:11,300
Any strangers or

537
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:13,090
unfamiliar vehicles around?

538
00:30:13,930 --> 00:30:14,800
No.

539
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:15,720
Has your daughter

540
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:17,160
made any new friends lately?

541
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:18,440
Or maybe

542
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:19,600
someone she met online?

543
00:30:21,190 --> 00:30:22,240
Zifeng...

544
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:23,960
You know, when a girl grows up,

545
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:24,840
she doesn't tell

546
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:25,760
her father everything.

547
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:27,960
Didn't your wife tell you anything?

548
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,880
I've been busy lately.

549
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,800
I haven't had much time
to talk to my wife.

550
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:37,400
Is there any problem

551
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:38,800
with your relationship?

552
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:45,840
Our relationship is fine.

553
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:48,480
Have my wife and child

554
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:50,760
really been kidnapped?

555
00:31:00,610 --> 00:31:01,500
How is it?

556
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:02,830
No suspicious clues found.

557
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,550
The suspect's vehicle was found
in Sinan Parking Lot.

558
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:10,280
The car is empty.

559
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:11,400
The suspect might have

560
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:12,490
switched vehicles here

561
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:13,690
to evade pursuit.

562
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:23,680
Looking at their financial situation,

563
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:25,840
this is not a typical target
for kidnappers.

564
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:27,040
Doesn't seem to be about money.

565
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:28,320
Captain Ye,

566
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:30,040
we've checked

567
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:31,280
all the vehicles

568
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:32,200
that entered your area.

569
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:33,910
Only a black SUV

570
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:37,400
with the license plate HAB22176
matches the information.

571
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:38,840
The vehicle is still being tracked.

572
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:40,480
We've sent people
to block the road.

573
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:43,240
Continue to pursue south of Libo Road.

574
00:31:43,420 --> 00:31:44,440
- Go.
- Yes.

575
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:04,400
Hey.

576
00:32:04,890 --> 00:32:05,780
Hey.

577
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:08,120
Are you sure you're not lying to me?

578
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:10,280
Qiang,

579
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:13,040
when have I ever lied to you?

580
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:13,960
Right?

581
00:32:14,150 --> 00:32:15,150
Don't worry.

582
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:17,280
This plan may be extreme,

583
00:32:17,940 --> 00:32:19,560
but when the truth comes out,

584
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:21,850
they'll thank you for it.

585
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:23,440
Trust me.

586
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:31,800
Hey,

587
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:33,080
aren't we going that way?

588
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:34,720
Too many cameras
on the main road.

589
00:32:34,850 --> 00:32:35,760
It's not safe.

590
00:32:58,180 --> 00:32:59,080
Hello.

591
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:00,920
This is the 110 emergency hotline.

592
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:05,960
Hello?

593
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:07,240
Can you hear me?

594
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:08,360
Hello?

595
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:09,400
Calling the police?

596
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:11,400
Hello?

597
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:12,920
Please speak.

598
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:14,960
Is it

599
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:17,080
inconvenient to talk?

600
00:33:17,190 --> 00:33:18,960
Captain Ye, Chen Lin

601
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:19,840
called us.

602
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:21,040
But no one spoke.

603
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:22,200
Put me through.

604
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:23,880
Track the location of the call.

605
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:25,500
Yes, tracking now.

606
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:30,920
Chen Lin,

607
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:32,920
this is Ye Zhen, captain
of Hummer Commandos.

608
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:34,200
Are you safe?

609
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:40,560
Lower your voice!

610
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:41,600
I will kill you.

611
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:43,760
Don't scream.

612
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:45,600
Don't scream.

613
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:53,080
I know you can't talk right now.

614
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:53,980
Don't panic.

615
00:33:54,180 --> 00:33:55,920
I'll ask the questions now.

616
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:57,120
If you can hear me,

617
00:33:57,550 --> 00:33:58,910
just press any key.

618
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:03,960
Good.

619
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:05,590
Is the call safe?

620
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:08,120
If yes, press once.

621
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:09,360
If not,

622
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:10,310
don't press.

623
00:34:13,350 --> 00:34:14,620
Are you Chen Lin?

624
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:19,840
You're not hurt, right?

625
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:27,470
There are two suspects?

626
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:35,860
What are you hiding?

627
00:34:36,030 --> 00:34:37,240
What exactly are you hiding?

628
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:38,920
Get away, get away.

629
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:40,760
- Don't move.
- What is it?

630
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:45,520
Hey,

631
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:47,420
they called the police, the police!

632
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:50,040
Throw the phone away, hurry.

633
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:50,960
You...

634
00:34:54,340 --> 00:34:55,230
You...

635
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:56,600
Behave!

636
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:58,920
You two want to die?

637
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:00,240
What should we do?

638
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:07,640
Captain Ye, the phone's
no longer moving.

639
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:09,320
Can you track the location?

640
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:11,560
It's on the county road
in Hedong Town, Baiyun Village.

641
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:13,040
(Hexi Town, Hedong Town)
Location will be sent.

642
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:14,080
Okay, thanks.

643
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:19,080
Captain, we've learned something.

644
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:21,360
Xu Zheng's family is very average.

645
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:23,320
But Chen Lin's mother is very rich.

646
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,000
Her father passed away early.

647
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,160
Chen Lin's mother has been living abroad

648
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:28,600
and running a company.

649
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:30,400
When they got married,

650
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,480
Chen's mother strongly
opposed her marrying Xu Zheng

651
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:35,400
because Xu's family was poor.

652
00:35:35,830 --> 00:35:36,960
In a fit of anger,

653
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:38,760
Chen Lin severed ties with her mother.

654
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:40,190
They've been apart
for over a decade.

655
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:42,400
Who else knows

656
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,000
Chen Lin's mother is very rich?

657
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:45,360
We asked Xu Zheng,

658
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:46,400
but he said

659
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,760
he and Chen Lin never talk about

660
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:48,680
her parents.

661
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,520
Even Xu Zifeng doesn't know

662
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:51,880
who her grandmother is.

663
00:35:58,460 --> 00:36:03,340
(Policewoman's Mini-Class)

664
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:05,100
(Policewoman's Mini-Class)
Officer, I get a query.

665
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:07,020
Why do you sound the alarm

666
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:08,420
every time you respond to a call?

667
00:36:08,420 --> 00:36:10,180
Don't you worry about
the criminals escaping?

668
00:36:10,220 --> 00:36:11,420
We don't always sound the alarm

669
00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:12,460
when responding to calls.

670
00:36:12,460 --> 00:36:14,020
But when it's a major case,

671
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:15,740
we won't hesitate to sound the alarm.

672
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:17,980
The goal is to deter the criminals.

673
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:21,580
But what if the criminals escape?

674
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:25,320
Preventing the crime is more important
than capturing the criminals.
