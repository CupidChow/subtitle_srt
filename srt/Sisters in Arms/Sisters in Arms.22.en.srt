=Episode 22=

24
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:38,980
This scenic area

25
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:40,670
covers five square kilometers.

26
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:43,750
Besides the main roads and public areas,

27
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,740
surveillance definitely has blind spots.

28
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:48,540
So, even if we deploy all our forces,

29
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:50,180
the search will still take time.

30
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:52,620
From a time perspective,

31
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:54,080
they probably haven't left this area.

32
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:56,660
Now, the biggest problem is

33
00:01:56,660 --> 00:01:57,740
the video is too blurry.

34
00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:00,460
Apart from the suspect
and the child's clothes,

35
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:02,680
we don't have any other effective features.

36
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:04,780
Captain.

37
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:06,750
We found the child's clothes
in the public toilet.

38
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:09,310
They match the description
from Diandian's mother.

39
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:10,720
Ask Diandian's mother to confirm it.

40
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:11,810
Okay.

41
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:13,500
In the surveillance room.

42
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:14,360
Alright.

43
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:15,970
Captain Zhou.

44
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:17,010
He has something to report.

45
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:19,140
- What is it?
- I didn't see clearly.

46
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:20,220
There were an elder and

47
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:22,260
a younger child, something felt wrong.

48
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:23,540
Also, Lu Xiaoying was wearing

49
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:24,540
a brown coat,

50
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:26,220
just like what you said
on the broadcast.

51
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:27,900
Xiaoying.

52
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:29,820
Mr. Wang.

53
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:31,980
This...

54
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:32,900
This is my daughter.

55
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:34,740
Whose child is this?

56
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:37,300
This is my son.

57
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:38,640
Who are you talking about?

58
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:39,620
Do you know her?

59
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,180
This is Captain Ye.

60
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:43,100
You can just tell her.

61
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:45,460
The girl I'm talking about

62
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:46,460
is called Lu Xiaoying.

63
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:47,860
She's from Fengwu Village.

64
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:50,060
A year ago, her son
passed away from illness.

65
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:52,060
Since then, she's been a little off.

66
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,340
Whenever she sees a kid
who looks like her son,

67
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:55,260
she calls them "son".

68
00:02:57,790 --> 00:02:58,660
Where did you see her?

69
00:02:58,660 --> 00:02:59,540
Where did she go?

70
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:00,660
Just in the woods behind.

71
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:02,460
She went on her way

72
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:03,580
back to our village.

73
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:05,140
She should be heading home.

74
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:09,140
Captain, it's confirmed.

75
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:10,210
This is Diandian's clothes.

76
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:13,620
- Zhou.
- Yes.

77
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:15,140
Check the Fengwu Village surveillance.

78
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:16,020
Okay.

79
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:17,900
Sir, take us to Lu Xiaoying's house.

80
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:19,540
Okay, let's go.

81
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:21,620
Let's go.

82
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:32,740
Captain Zhu.

83
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:37,180
How's it going?

84
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:39,140
We didn't get anything.

85
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:40,100
She won't say anything

86
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:41,020
and refuse to admit it.

87
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:43,220
It's hard to tell.

88
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:45,820
Any clues from Wang Yutian's side?

89
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:47,710
She's just a young receptionist.

90
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:49,110
Her family is in a bad condition.

91
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:50,660
But she suddenly had money.

92
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:51,620
Why is that?

93
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:52,940
She must have found a rich man.

94
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:54,580
I checked, it's not the case.

95
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:55,860
But

96
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:57,380
she has a history of drug use.

97
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:00,940
Are you suspecting Wang Yutian

98
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:02,060
of drug trafficking?

99
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:03,900
Let's try it.

100
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:05,580
Talk to her.

101
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:07,140
Okay.

102
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:30,100
You're so bold.

103
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:33,860
What's wrong?

104
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:36,710
Are you afraid I'll be arrested?

105
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:40,970
Several people were arrested.

106
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:44,240
Do you think we're
moving too aggressively?

107
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:48,420
Is that so?

108
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:52,340
We're not?

109
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:17,540
Haven't you been watching

110
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:18,660
that police officer?

111
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:20,420
Anything you got out of it?

112
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:22,220
Ms. Ai.

113
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,080
You've got to give me some face.

114
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:25,740
Right?

115
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:26,660
Let's go have some fun.

116
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:28,420
What are you doing?

117
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:30,580
You...

118
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:32,020
Who are you?

119
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:34,460
(Police)
Are you okay?

120
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:36,820
Captain Zhu.

121
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:39,220
Hello.

122
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:40,140
Hello, hello.

123
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:41,900
Hello, hello, hello.

124
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:44,500
I wanted to get close to him.

125
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:46,620
But he's very cautious.

126
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:49,550
I had no chance at all.

127
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:58,140
Is there anyone

128
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:02,260
that you can't charm?

129
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:07,540
I'm getting old.

130
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:10,800
Only you think I'm pretty.

131
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:16,060
No.

132
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:22,060
You're my Ai Lian.

133
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:27,220
You will always be my Ai Lian.

134
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:32,220
You're the prettiest.

135
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:52,260
Lu Xiaoying is beautiful,

136
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:53,180
and likable.

137
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:54,810
Although her parents
passed away young,

138
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:56,980
she married a good husband.

139
00:06:57,420 --> 00:06:58,460
Her husband can earn money,

140
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:00,580
and they had a son and a daughter.

141
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:01,700
Everything was perfect.

142
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:03,100
Everyone in the village

143
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:04,020
was jealous of her.

144
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:05,500
Where's her husband?

145
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:07,620
After they divorced,

146
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:08,980
her husband took the child

147
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:10,720
and moved to his parents' house.

148
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:13,340
They got divorced?

149
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:15,540
- Why?
- Who knows?

150
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:17,100
They had such a good relationship.

151
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:18,180
What a shame.

152
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:19,780
Maybe because their son died,

153
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:21,880
so the family fell apart.

154
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:24,300
When I saw Lu Xiaoying just now,

155
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,610
she had completely changed.

156
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:27,500
Her soul was gone.

157
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:28,580
She lost her job

158
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:29,740
and looked pitiful.

159
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:33,900
Pull over here.

160
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:34,900
The house is just ahead.

161
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:41,820
Lu Xiaoying.

162
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:44,660
Lu Xiaoying.

163
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,100
Zhao, what are you doing?

164
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:48,020
Hey.

165
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:49,020
I'm here for Lu Xiaoying.

166
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:49,860
She took the child

167
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:51,510
from the kindergarten
without telling me.

168
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:55,820
Comrades,

169
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:57,380
please send someone
to unlock the door.

170
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:58,300
Okay.

171
00:07:58,300 --> 00:07:59,260
(Limin Grocery)

172
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:02,020
Boss.

173
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:03,460
Eating instant noodles again?

174
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:04,740
How much is this?

175
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:13,900
36 yuan.

176
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:15,020
Scan the code.

177
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:15,940
Okay.

178
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:20,100
I saw a police car

179
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:21,140
in our village.

180
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:22,580
Has something happened?

181
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:30,140
What's it to you?

182
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:33,060
Just asking.

183
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:38,100
Um, well...

184
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:40,100
Someone's child

185
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:41,620
is missing.

186
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:43,740
Oh.

187
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:45,220
The payment is done.

188
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:05,580
Hello, excuse me,

189
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:07,500
how do I get to Feiyun Mountain
Camping Base?

190
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:13,020
I don't know.

191
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:15,640
I'll get a bottle of water.

192
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:20,340
Ten yuan.

193
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:22,160
Okay, I'll pay via WeChat.

194
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:27,980
It's paid.

195
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:31,540
Hey.

196
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:36,780
At the intersection ahead,

197
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:38,980
turn left.

198
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:40,060
It's right there.

199
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:42,140
Thank you.

200
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:09,500
It's the same as

201
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:10,920
when I left.

202
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:13,260
When Yangyang was here,

203
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:15,580
he used this blanket.

204
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:23,380
Actually,

205
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:25,900
Xiaoying is the best mother
in the world.

206
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:29,380
If it weren't for...

207
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:35,820
Look, what's this?

208
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:36,820
Isn't it beautiful?

209
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:38,060
It's so beautiful.

210
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:39,700
So beautiful.

211
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:42,360
There are many more over there.

212
00:10:42,370 --> 00:10:43,700
Shall we go there and play?

213
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:45,660
- Okay.
- Okay.

214
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:08,460
Officer Ye.

215
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:09,660
What happened to Lu Xiaoying?

216
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:16,020
She took away

217
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:16,980
someone else's child

218
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:18,100
and thought it was your son.

219
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:27,500
Mr. Zhao.

220
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:30,060
Is there something

221
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:30,980
you're not telling us?

222
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:33,100
No.

223
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:41,780
Captain.

224
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:43,900
I found Lu Xiaoying's notebook.

225
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:45,180
It contains this video.

226
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:54,300
Happy birthday to you.

227
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:58,220
Happy birthday to you.

228
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:02,460
Happy birthday, dear Yangyang.

229
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:06,780
Happy birthday to you.

230
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:08,850
Make a wish, Yangyang.

231
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:14,340
Ta da.

232
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:15,580
A big car.

233
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:16,940
Thank you, Mom.

234
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:18,100
Do you like it?

235
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:19,540
I like it.

236
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:57,180
Hey, how's it going?

237
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:00,740
Captain.

238
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:02,000
We still haven't found them.

239
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:09,300
Mom, I want some water.

240
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:12,260
I'll get it for you.

241
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:18,340
Baby, here's the water.

242
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:22,700
You drink it too.

243
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:25,140
Here.

244
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:27,420
Mom.

245
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:30,140
Why don't you live with Dad anymore?

246
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:33,260
Grandma said you got a divorce.

247
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:35,820
Why did you get a divorce?

248
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:38,340
Xiaoying.

249
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:41,060
Let's split up.

250
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:43,700
You said

251
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:46,820
our family would never be separated.

252
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:49,500
Yangyang will never come back.

253
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:52,620
We won't be a happy family again.

254
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:04,460
Lu Xiaoying.

255
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:05,810
What are you doing here?

256
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:07,580
The whole village is looking for you.

257
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:09,700
You shouldn't bring the child here.

258
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:11,060
It's not right.

259
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:13,060
Hurry up and return the child.

260
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:15,260
Kid, kid.

261
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:16,100
Don't cry, don't cry.

262
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:17,180
Who are you?

263
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:19,300
Put my son down.

264
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:20,580
I'll take him to find his mom.

265
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:22,580
I am his mother.

266
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:23,540
You're not his mother.

267
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:24,900
How am I not his mother?

268
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:26,460
- Let go, let go.
- Put my son down.

269
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:27,580
You're not his mother.

270
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:28,980
Put him down.

271
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:32,220
- Put down.
- What are you doing?

272
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:33,500
- Put him down!
- Help!

273
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:34,450
- Help!
- Put him down!

274
00:15:34,450 --> 00:15:35,300
What are you doing?

275
00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:36,180
Xiaoying

276
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:38,770
is actually a very kind person.

277
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:42,780
She just misses Yangyang too much.

278
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:45,300
She would never hurt that child.

279
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:47,980
If this child is found,

280
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:50,540
you won't arrest her,

281
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:51,460
right?

282
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:54,580
I can't answer that right now.

283
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:56,900
If the court

284
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:58,400
finds that she has a mental illness,

285
00:15:58,780 --> 00:16:01,220
- she will definitely be...
- Lu Xiaoying is not mentally ill.

286
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:03,020
She's not.

287
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:07,860
Mr. Zhao.

288
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:09,380
Can I ask you a question?

289
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:13,700
Why did you divorce?

290
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:23,620
If you still care about her,

291
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:25,940
you must tell us the truth

292
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:26,940
about her condition.

293
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:28,560
Otherwise, we won't be able to help her.

294
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:34,780
Since

295
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:36,580
Yangyang passed away,

296
00:16:38,050 --> 00:16:38,900
Xiaoying's

297
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:40,500
mental health has been poor.

298
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:44,220
She has to rely on medication every day

299
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:47,060
to numb her pain.

300
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:50,100
Later, I don't know where

301
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:52,010
she got into drugs.

302
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:55,050
You divorced because of this?

303
00:16:57,060 --> 00:16:57,980
Yes.

304
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:01,180
I didn't want her
to hurt my daughter again.

305
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:02,420
She can't quit.

306
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:04,700
She agreed to the divorce.

307
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:10,100
Captain.

308
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:11,500
Someone saw her.

309
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:25,620
- Officer Ye.
- How is it?

310
00:17:25,630 --> 00:17:26,620
She's inside.

311
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:28,460
- Take us in.
- Okay.

312
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:35,060
Qiaoqiao, behave.

313
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:36,060
Don't throw a tantrum.

314
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:38,260
I'll buy you something delicious later.

315
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:39,940
Mom.

316
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:41,740
What happened to my brother?

317
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:45,100
Your brother...

318
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:46,780
He's fine.

319
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:48,620
He's fine.

320
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:50,300
Mom, Mom.

321
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:51,900
When my little brother was sick,

322
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:53,460
it was like this too.

323
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:54,660
Is he going to die?

324
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:56,060
Don't talk nonsense!

325
00:17:56,620 --> 00:17:57,620
How could he die?

326
00:17:58,420 --> 00:17:59,500
Diandian!

327
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:01,680
Diandian!

328
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:04,050
Diandian!

329
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:09,100
Diandian, Diandian!

330
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:10,060
Don't come near me!

331
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:11,300
Diandian!

332
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:12,780
- Diandian.
- Don't come closer.

333
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:14,100
- Calm down.
- She has a weapon.

334
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:14,980
We'll handle it.

335
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:16,180
Why is she not reacting?

336
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:17,340
Who are you?

337
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:18,540
She's allergic to grain.

338
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:19,420
She has asthma.

339
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:20,900
- Please, save her.
- Who are you?

340
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:22,220
Don't come near my son.

341
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:24,140
Don't come, don't come!

342
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:25,540
- Stay away!
- Lu Xiaoying!

343
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:27,980
Dad.

344
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:31,500
Zhao Meng, tell them
not to come near me.

345
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:32,660
Lu Xiaoying.

346
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:34,180
Calm down first.

347
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:35,460
The child is sick.

348
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:37,380
I'm bringing her medicine now.

349
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:39,860
Don't come near me.

350
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:41,500
Don't come near me!

351
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:43,060
My child is fine.

352
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:44,420
Mom, what's wrong?

353
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:45,860
He's my dad.

354
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:47,780
I'm fine.

355
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:49,660
No one will take my child away.

356
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:51,340
Don't come near me.

357
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:52,660
Lu Xiaoying.

358
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:54,220
No one is going to take your son.

359
00:18:57,180 --> 00:18:58,300
Look behind at Qiaoqiao.

360
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:00,540
She's your daughter.

361
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:02,940
She's really worried about you.

362
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:08,000
Zhao Meng is also worried about you.

363
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:11,660
I know

364
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:13,460
you're in pain right now.

365
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:16,820
But you need to let those

366
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:17,740
who love you help you.

367
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:20,380
Don't rely on medication,

368
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:21,500
especially on drugs.

369
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:23,660
Can you understand?

370
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:31,260
Look.

371
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:33,820
Your child is very uncomfortable now.

372
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,900
I'll have Zhao Meng
bring her some medicine.

373
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:39,020
Okay?

374
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:42,860
Zhao Meng.

375
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:44,380
Yangyang, he…

376
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:45,340
What happened to him?

377
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:46,620
Xiaoying.

378
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:48,300
Don't be afraid.

379
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:50,240
What happened to Yangyang?

380
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:51,540
Yangyang is sick.

381
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:53,020
Don't be scared.

382
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:55,740
Give me the child.

383
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:01,940
- Yangyang.
- Yangyang.

384
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:05,460
Yangyang, don't be afraid.

385
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:09,500
Yangyang.

386
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:11,860
Xiaoying.

387
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:13,720
Yangyang is in a serious condition now.

388
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:16,340
I'll take him to the hospital
for a check-up.

389
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:18,700
To the hospital.

390
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:23,260
Where are you going?

391
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:25,460
Let go of me.

392
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:28,660
Give me back my son!

393
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:30,100
Yangyang!

394
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:32,940
Give me back my son!

395
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:34,660
- Xiaoying.
- Yangyang!

396
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:35,940
Come to your senses.

397
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:37,500
Yangyang!

398
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:39,060
Yangyang is dead!

399
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:53,580
Dad.

400
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:54,700
Qiaoqiao.

401
00:21:04,090 --> 00:21:05,380
He's dead?

402
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:36,500
(Outpatient)

403
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:41,260
Are you Wang Yutian?

404
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:42,540
Who are you?

405
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:44,520
We are from the Anti-narcotics Brigade.

406
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:46,140
We need to ask you some questions.

407
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:49,060
Why do you need to ask me?

408
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:51,140
I used to do drugs,

409
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:52,900
but I've quit.

410
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:54,280
We won't talk about the past.

411
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:55,980
Can we chat?

412
00:21:57,340 --> 00:21:58,380
I don't know anything.

413
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:03,940
My wound hurts so much.

414
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:06,020
Nurse.

415
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:07,540
Nurse.

416
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:08,460
Let me tell you,

417
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:10,180
we're here to help you.

418
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:12,520
If you don't want help, that's fine.

419
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:14,900
Alright, don't bother.

420
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:16,120
Let her deal with it herself.

421
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:17,300
Let's go.

422
00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:19,060
What do you mean by that?

423
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:22,820
You should know very well

424
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:25,100
why we are looking for you.

425
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:26,660
Confessing voluntarily

426
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:28,300
is completely different

427
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:30,460
from getting caught.

428
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:35,140
Originally, I thought

429
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:36,780
you were quite young,

430
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:38,460
and had a chance to change.

431
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:39,380
Yes.

432
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:40,900
But...

433
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:44,180
- What a pity.
- What a pity.

434
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:48,940
Wait.

435
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:01,700
Lu Xiaoying.

436
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:05,100
Where did you get

437
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:06,420
the drugs from?

438
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:08,130
I found them online.

439
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:09,540
How did you make the transaction?

440
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:11,300
I paid the money,

441
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:14,420
and they put it in a delivery locker.

442
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:18,140
Which locker?

443
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:20,580
The one at the entrance of our village.

444
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:22,500
(Interrogation Record)

445
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:25,540
I was just greedy.

446
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:27,910
I work in a beauty salon.

447
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:31,620
I thought I had completely quit.

448
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:33,470
There was no way
I would touch drugs again.

449
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:35,660
But

450
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:38,100
last month...

451
00:23:58,820 --> 00:23:59,740
Ms. Chen.

452
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:00,600
Here.

453
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:03,500
Sorry, sorry.

454
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:04,420
It's okay, it's okay.

455
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:07,580
- Here you are.
- Hello.

456
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:08,660
Go inside.

457
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:09,940
I've arranged for you.

458
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:10,940
Ms. Ai Lian.

459
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:11,780
You go ahead.

460
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:12,700
I'll clean this up.

461
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:15,260
No need, go get things ready.

462
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:16,700
Cut some fruit, make some tea.

463
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:18,420
Hurry along now.

464
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:19,660
- Okay.
- Go quickly.

465
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:21,220
This regular customer

466
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:23,700
comes every two weeks.

467
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:26,070
She never asks for other beauticians,

468
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:28,440
and is always served by our boss.

469
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:31,150
The face mask powder she ordered

470
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:33,900
was made from ordinary ingredients.

471
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,740
It's not worth much money at all.

472
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:37,620
And

473
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:39,020
this kind of customer

474
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:40,940
is usually for new employees to practice.

475
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:44,180
Why is the boss
so considerate towards her?

476
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:45,820
Even if

477
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:47,420
Ms. Chen is rich,

478
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:50,380
she's not doing charity.

479
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:52,380
Why give the boss so much money?

480
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:55,620
How did you know
those things were drugs?

481
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:58,020
The last time,

482
00:24:58,140 --> 00:24:59,680
face mask powder
spilled on the floor.

483
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:01,680
My boss didn't let me touch it.

484
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:03,460
My sixth sense told me

485
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:05,720
that powder was suspicious.

486
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:07,780
So

487
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:09,300
I secretly

488
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:10,660
made a copy of the warehouse key.

489
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:40,340
I've used drugs before.

490
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:41,660
I know exactly what it is.

491
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:45,260
I also considered calling the police then.

492
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:47,860
But

493
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:50,160
my mind went to dark places.

494
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:55,470
I took two boxes of powder

495
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:57,680
and replaced them
with ordinary powder.

496
00:25:58,140 --> 00:25:59,260
After I got home,

497
00:25:59,980 --> 00:26:01,660
I found those friends of mine,

498
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:03,140
and managed to sell it.

499
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:06,500
What's the beauty salon's address

500
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:07,780
and name?

501
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:09,620
Lili's Beauty Salon.

502
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:12,060
It's in Shengxin Creative Park.

503
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:13,300
Who is the boss?

504
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:14,580
Ai Lian.

505
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:15,500
Ai Lian?

506
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:16,420
Yes.

507
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:24,820
Do you know who

508
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:25,740
traded with Ai Lian?

509
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:27,140
Or

510
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:28,940
her distinguishing features?

511
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:31,380
I don't know her name.

512
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:34,180
We all call her

513
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:35,900
Ms. Chen.

514
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:38,300
She's in her 40s,

515
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:39,500
not tall.

516
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:48,300
Yes, that's her.

517
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:55,420
(Lili's Beauty Salon)

518
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:56,340
Police.

519
00:26:57,420 --> 00:26:58,260
Where's your boss?

520
00:26:58,260 --> 00:27:00,260
She went out of town
for a collaboration.

521
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:01,180
Where exactly?

522
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:29,200
Captain, I found something.

523
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:35,020
Move this box out.

524
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:35,940
Yes.

525
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:42,500
(Binjiang Public Security Bureau)

526
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:51,500
Chen Yan.

527
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:53,500
Someone has discovered

528
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:55,300
that you and Ai Lian

529
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:57,980
have been using
beauty services as a cover

530
00:27:59,140 --> 00:28:00,060
to sell drugs.

531
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:03,680
Do you have anything to say?

532
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:13,740
Okay.

533
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:15,740
I hope when we find Ai Lian,

534
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:17,880
she can be as tight-lipped

535
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:19,940
as you.

536
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:26,020
Here comes the meat.

537
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:29,900
So beautiful!

538
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:36,100
Wow, I want to eat it.

539
00:28:36,250 --> 00:28:37,650
It smells so good.

540
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:02,630
- Here it comes.
- Here it comes.

541
00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:05,340
It smells so good.

542
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:07,220
Eat it while it's hot.

543
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:09,500
What is this?

544
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:10,500
Who roasted this?

545
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:11,860
Danyang did. Try it.

546
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:13,340
- Captain, try it.
- Okay.

547
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:14,420
I roasted the pork belly.

548
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:15,820
Really? Let me try.

549
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:17,020
Lu Xiaoying is quite pitiful.

550
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:17,870
Those drug addicts

551
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:19,420
always target these vulnerable people.

552
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:21,340
Did she become like this

553
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:22,260
because of drugs?

554
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:25,540
She thought drugs could numb herself,

555
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:26,460
and ease the pain.

556
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:29,280
No matter how many reasons
there are for using drugs,

557
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:30,580
there is only one outcome.

558
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:31,900
The pain is doubled.

559
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:34,080
My mother is especially
afraid of me touching drugs.

560
00:29:34,660 --> 00:29:35,580
And those

561
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,680
using drugs under
the guise of seeking inspiration,

562
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:39,500
they have no idea how painful it gets.

563
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:44,180
Alright, enough.

564
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:46,400
Let's not talk about
the unpleasant things.

565
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:48,140
We've finally gotten out, right?

566
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:49,140
And today,

567
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:51,780
we helped Diandian's mother, right?

568
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:54,380
Yes, let's have a drink.

569
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:57,100
- Okay!
- Okay!

570
00:29:57,260 --> 00:30:00,020
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

572
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:12,540
Three, two, one, go!

573
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:14,540
Clang clang clang.

574
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:16,540
Clang clang clang.

575
00:30:16,540 --> 00:30:18,640
Let's not talk about idle chatter

576
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:20,610
and compliment Wu Song,

577
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:21,500
a hero from Shandong.

578
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:22,460
Clang clang clang.

579
00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:25,100
Wu Song studied martial arts
at Shaolin Temple.

580
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:27,180
He practiced for eight years.

581
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:28,140
Clang clang clang.

582
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:31,220
One day, Wu Song felt homesick

583
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:33,300
and decided to visit his home.

584
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:34,180
Clang clang clang.

585
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:36,260
He held a patrol staff in his hand

586
00:30:36,260 --> 00:30:38,140
and tied his bundle to his shoulder.

587
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:43,580
Jump up!

588
00:31:05,180 --> 00:31:06,620
The money has been laundered.

589
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:12,860
What should I do without you?

590
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:16,000
After I deliver this batch of goods,

591
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:18,620
I'm planning to quit.

592
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:23,720
Are you in a rush to leave me?

593
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:26,340
You promised me

594
00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:28,660
you'd finish this batch of goods,

595
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:30,180
and then stop.

596
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:31,900
But you didn't keep your promise.

597
00:31:33,380 --> 00:31:34,420
Now you're making drugs.

598
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:35,460
It's getting worse.

599
00:31:36,380 --> 00:31:37,340
When will it end?

600
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:40,100
The bigger the play,

601
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:42,060
the more money I make.

602
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:44,620
Who wouldn't want money?

603
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:46,060
I'm sorry.

604
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:48,980
I need to plan for my daughter.

605
00:31:55,060 --> 00:31:55,980
Yun'er.

606
00:31:58,660 --> 00:31:59,740
Your daughter.

607
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:10,460
All these years,

608
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:11,540
you chose to leave me

609
00:32:11,540 --> 00:32:12,780
for someone else every time.

610
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:15,900
Am I right?

611
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:21,540
Back then, I left home to give you

612
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:23,180
the life you wanted.

613
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:25,920
I did the hardest
and most exhausting work,

614
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:27,700
almost losing my life.

615
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:31,420
Finally brought the blood-stained bag of cash
back to you,

616
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:32,340
and then what happened?

617
00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:36,980
You married a worthless man.

618
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:37,980
Don't talk about him.

619
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:38,900
Why not?

620
00:32:39,340 --> 00:32:40,260
He was a useless man.

621
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:44,540
Look at your hands.

622
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:47,700
What did that guy give you?

623
00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:50,140
Yes.

624
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:53,140
Think about it.

625
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:56,220
I've been with you these years,

626
00:32:56,820 --> 00:32:58,140
helping you with your business,

627
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:00,820
and found the best dance teacher
for your daughter,

628
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:04,500
so that you could live a life
free of worry.

629
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:07,700
Now you're telling me

630
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:09,420
that you

631
00:33:11,020 --> 00:33:11,940
want to leave me?

632
00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:15,600
I never said I wanted to leave you.

633
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:18,270
I just said I don't
want to do this anymore.

634
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:19,700
These years,

635
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:22,560
I've helped you earn
quite a lot of money, right?

636
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:24,660
Right.

637
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:25,900
Indeed.

638
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:29,720
You are very talented in this field.

639
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:36,300
I've said it before,

640
00:33:37,180 --> 00:33:38,100
we are

641
00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:40,860
a perfectly matched pair

642
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:43,260
of jerks.

643
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:46,420
Neither of us can live
without the other.

644
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:50,400
I know you're worried
because of the recent tension.

645
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:52,420
Trust me.

646
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:54,400
The day we make a comeback
is not far off.

647
00:33:54,620 --> 00:33:55,540
You make the comeback.

648
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:56,740
Let me go, okay?

649
00:33:57,740 --> 00:33:59,140
I just want to live a peaceful life

650
00:33:59,140 --> 00:34:00,620
with Yun'er.

651
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:15,020
Your Yun'er

652
00:34:16,180 --> 00:34:17,180
is an artist.

653
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:21,180
She can't endure the hardships
you and I have gone through.

654
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:24,420
Even if she goes abroad,

655
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:27,360
she can't just live off of nothing.

656
00:34:29,620 --> 00:34:30,540
Besides,

657
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:36,780
if something happens to her,

658
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:42,280
she won't be able to go abroad.

659
00:34:46,140 --> 00:34:47,060
It's highly possible.

660
00:34:50,140 --> 00:34:51,380
By that time,

661
00:34:57,500 --> 00:34:58,920
you'll regret everything

662
00:34:58,940 --> 00:35:00,400
you said today.

663
00:35:07,820 --> 00:35:08,740
Think about it.

664
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,550
I'm not a heartless person.

665
00:35:52,780 --> 00:35:53,700
Don't push me.

666
00:36:11,060 --> 00:36:15,940
(Policewoman's Mini-Class)

667
00:36:16,530 --> 00:36:18,230
Starting a fight
over a little disagreement

668
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:20,190
will cost you dearly
with both sides losing.

669
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:21,860
Don't fight.

670
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:24,310
Enjoy eating and drinking at gatherings,

671
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:26,150
but don't drive after drinking.

672
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,210
