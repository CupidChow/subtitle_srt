It's from Chen Yun'er.

27
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:10,740

Zhou,

31
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:18,380
evacuate the crowd

and keep them calm.

00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:21,880

The bomb on Chen Yun'er

40
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:30,900
looks like the one we saw
at the pizza shop.

41
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:32,660
But this bomb

42
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:33,740
can't be timed.

43
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:35,500
It could go off any second.

44
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:38,380
Don't act rashly.

46
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:41,140
Can I talk to her?

47
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:42,500
Alright.

48
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:43,540
Go.

49
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:48,860
Yun'er,

50
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:50,150
it's Tata.

00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:53,230
(Surveillance 01)

52
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:54,220
Can we talk?

53
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:57,700
I never imagined one day

54
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:00,020
we'd be talking like this.

55
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:07,300
Look,

56
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:09,580
I look terrible in this photo.

57
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:12,560
But I just can't delete it,

58
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:15,920
because every time I see it,

59
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:17,260
I feel healed.

60
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:19,300
I don't have any siblings.

61
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:22,960
I really see you as my little sister.

62
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:24,420
So

63
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:25,740
I...

64
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:28,380
I want you to believe me.
No matter what,

65
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:30,380
I'll be there for you, okay?

66
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:31,740
Yun'er.

67
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:33,300
Can you say something to me?

68
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:36,220
I know now

69
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:38,680
you're in pain and feeling hopeless.

70
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:41,100
I'm really sorry.

71
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:44,020
It breaks my heart too

72
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:45,180
to see you face

73
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:46,100
so many hardships

74
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:47,220
at such a young age.

75
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:49,380
It's too cruel.

76
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:51,700
But whether as your sister

77
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:52,790
or as your friend,

78
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:54,280
I have to tell you,

79
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:56,130
doing this

80
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:58,210
won't save your mother.

81
00:03:58,860 --> 00:03:59,980
It will only backfire,

82
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:00,900
hurting both of you.

83
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:03,020
You know?

84
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:08,500
Chen Yun'er,

85
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:10,900
is this the courage
you were looking for?

86
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:12,300
Huh?

87
00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:13,420
No.

88
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:14,340
You're wrong.

89
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:17,300
True courage is to face things.

90
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:20,280
I know you want to save your mother,

91
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,580
but she committed a crime.

92
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,100
As an adult,

93
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:25,760
she has to be responsible
for her actions.

94
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:27,300
You don't have to take this.

95
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:29,460
Do you understand me?

96
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:32,740
Am I right,

97
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:33,860
Yun'er's mom?

98
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:38,740
Do you want your daughter

99
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:40,060
to save you this way?

100
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:43,060
You'll kill her.

101
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:47,060
Can you say something?

102
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:55,780
Why is it so quiet?

103
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:57,740
Tata,

104
00:04:58,140 --> 00:04:59,700
try talking to Ai Lian

105
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:01,640
and getting her to say something.

106
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:04,980
Ai Lian.

107
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:06,860
Don't you think

108
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:08,300
you're being a bit selfish?

109
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:11,020
She's your biological daughter.

110
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:14,810
You're going to ruin her.

111
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:17,580
Whatever you're thinking,

112
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:19,580
whatever you need, you can tell me.

113
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:21,060
Let's talk, alright?

114
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:25,700
No.

115
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:28,860
That's not right.

116
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:31,180
Ai Lian hasn't said a word.

117
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,860
What did Chen Yun'er just say?

118
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:37,820
If we go in,

119
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:39,660
she'll detonate the bomb.

120
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:41,900
Captain.

121
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:42,900
Is it possible

122
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:44,240
that she's just stalling for time?

123
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:46,940
If Ai Lian was inside,

124
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:48,340
and even if Wu was there,

125
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:50,780
Yun'er would've

126
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:52,380
tried to make us leave

127
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:53,860
to buy them time to escape,

128
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:55,420
instead of stopping us from entering

129
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:56,480
like what she's doing now.

130
00:05:56,780 --> 00:05:57,820
They've already fled.

131
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:01,820
I guess only Chen Yun'er
is in the basement now.

132
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:03,820
If Wu isn't there,

133
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:05,660
we could assume he's at the drug den.

134
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:07,900
But why isn't Ai Lian here?

135
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:13,800
If there's a tunnel
connecting to the secret room,

136
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:15,660
there must be another exit.

137
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:19,540
Ai Lian must have returned
to this house for a reason.

138
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:23,580
Command Center,

139
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:26,220
check the county records
and terrain of Fengwu Village.

Mad Dog.

143
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,960
A bunch of police cars
just showed up in the village.

144
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:55,660
They've sealed off every exit.

145
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:11,860
Why won't he pick up?

146
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:13,640
Did something happen to Wu?

147
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:15,260
- Go check it out.
- Okay.

148
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:09,900
(Mazheng Grocery)

149
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:19,060
How's it?

150
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:20,420
Captain Zhu, nothing found.

151
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:50,540
Move.

152
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:37,940
- Ma.
- Yes.

153
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:39,460
- Block the back.
- Yes, sir.

154
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:46,020
Mad Dog, Mad Dog.

155
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:47,740
I swear I only sold once.

156
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:48,820
Just once?

157
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:50,620
Just once?

158
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:51,860
Only once?

159
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:55,020
Mad Dog.

160
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:56,640
There are cops all over
outside my house,

161
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:57,580
and also sniffer dogs.

162
00:09:57,740 --> 00:09:58,660
Pack up!

163
00:09:58,660 --> 00:09:59,540
Escape through tunnel!

164
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:00,460
Okay.

165
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:01,660
Move quickly!

166
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:11,460
Big guy.

167
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:12,380
Yeah?

168
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:29,020
Sniffer dog.

169
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:13,220
Mad Dog, the police are here!

170
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:16,340
Get up!

171
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:17,620
Mad Dog.

172
00:11:17,630 --> 00:11:19,220
Did you lead the cops here?

173
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:20,380
It wasn't me.

174
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:21,460
Really, it wasn't me.

175
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:22,860
Not you?

176
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:23,820
Fine.

177
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:24,780
You go up first

178
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:25,700
and cover for me.

179
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:27,540
Mad Dog,

180
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:28,540
I'll be dead then.

181
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:32,740
If you don't go, you'll die right now.

182
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:41,300
Go.

183
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:44,060
All packed?

184
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:44,980
Yeah.

185
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:21,220
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

186
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:23,740
Hurry!

187
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:29,340
Come out!

188
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:30,980
Don't shoot!

189
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:32,020
Don't shoot!

190
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:35,260
- Where's everyone else?
- Just me.

191
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:36,180
The rest all ran.

192
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:37,780
Cuff him.

193
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:01,820
Captain Zhu.

194
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:04,300
Move.

195
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:24,460
Police! Don't move!

196
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:31,500
Are you okay?

197
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:49,620
Don't move!

198
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:50,860
- Drop the gun!
- Drop the gun!

199
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:51,780
Drop it now!

200
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:53,060
Hands on your head!

201
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:55,180
Hands up!

202
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:58,020
Command Center,

203
00:13:58,060 --> 00:13:59,520
we've got the suspects under control.

204
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:09,820
Captain Ye.

205
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:11,300
We found

206
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:13,400
there's an old abandoned passage
in Fengwu Village.

207
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:15,140
I'll send you the coordinates.

208
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:24,180
It's nearby,

209
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:26,020
about 200 meters away.

210
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:28,140
Where does it lead?

211
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:29,980
(Yunshan Mine,
Feiyun Mountain Central Town)

212
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:31,740
Central Town.

213
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:39,900
(Police)

214
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:10,900
(Binjiang Armed Patrol)

215
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:25,020
Take her away.

216
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:28,780
Tata,

217
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:29,820
Ai Lian has been caught.

218
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:32,220
Talk to Chen Yun'er again

219
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:33,240
and try to calm her down.

220
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:39,340
Yun'er.

221
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:42,180
Are you thirsty?

222
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:46,620
(Surveillance)

223
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:47,540
Yun'er.

224
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:50,820
Tata.

225
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:54,140
Has my mom

226
00:15:56,740 --> 00:15:58,340
already been caught?

227
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:01,180
Huh?

228
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:04,540
Isn't your mom with you?

229
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:06,540
Stop lying to me.

230
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:08,900
I know

231
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:10,740
you've already caught my mom.

232
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,100
Yun'er, wait for my call.

233
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:15,020
I'll call you

234
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:16,240
in half an hour at most.

235
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:17,460
The exit

236
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:18,380
is near the station.

237
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:19,660
They may not catch up.

238
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:21,700
Once you get my call,

239
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:23,180
tell the police

240
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:24,340
I forced you

241
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:25,460
and threatened you.

242
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:26,820
Remember that?

243
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:30,900
Mom,

244
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:32,260
there's no time left.

245
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:34,540
Go quickly.

246
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:38,980
I'm sorry, my child.

247
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:43,420
Mom.

248
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:44,540
Go now.

249
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:47,300
Yun'er.

250
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:01,700
Yun'er, listen to me.

251
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:04,020
Can you open the door?

252
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:05,580
Let's talk.

253
00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:07,140
I want to speak to Captain Ye.

254
00:17:07,590 --> 00:17:08,460
Alright.

255
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:09,380
Okay.

256
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:11,340
I'll go get her.

257
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:12,660
Wait for me.

258
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:28,150
Raptor Commandos only caught Ai Lian.

259
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:29,560
Based on her statement,

260
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:30,970
she killed Wu.

261
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:32,940
The body is in the basement tunnel.

262
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:34,940
Chen Yun'er is not in danger.

263
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:36,820
Ai Lian said the bomb is fake,

264
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:37,780
just for bluffing.

265
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:39,740
She didn't want Yun'er
to be in danger,

266
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:40,740
so she didn't use real one.

267
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:42,340
Understood.

268
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:03,500
Chen Yun'er.

269
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:04,580
I'm here.

270
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:06,020
Yun'er, open the door.

271
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:08,340
Tata.

272
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:09,620
Don't come near me.

273
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:10,900
This is a real bomb.

274
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:25,940
These two bombs.

275
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:27,740
One is real,

276
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:29,020
and one is fake.

277
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:30,820
Both were custom-made by Wu.

278
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:32,340
That guy

279
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:33,540
was very meticulous.

280
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:35,340
We'll just use

281
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:36,460
the fake one.

282
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:38,740
Don't worry.

283
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:40,980
This one won't explode.

284
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:42,300
Stay inside here,

285
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:43,980
and don't let them in.

286
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:49,980
I won't move.

287
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:51,860
Captain Ye.

288
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:53,820
I want to see my mom.

289
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:55,940
Otherwise,

290
00:18:57,820 --> 00:18:58,740
I'll blow up the bomb.

291
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:17,660
Hurry, quick.

292
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:18,820
Captain Ye.

293
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:19,740
Please

294
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:20,820
save Yun'er.

295
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:22,180
I'm begging you

296
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:23,220
to save her.

297
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:26,620
You know we can't

298
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:27,740
agree to Yun'er's demand.

299
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:30,620
Captain,

300
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:32,880
I can dismantle the bomb on Yun'er.

301
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:35,530
But her hands aren't restrained.

302
00:19:35,890 --> 00:19:37,540
She'll detonate it before I get close.

303
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:41,260
Your daughter

304
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:43,620
is trying to save your life with hers.

305
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:44,540
Do you get it now?

306
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:46,420
She's desperate now!

307
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:56,700
If you'd known it'd come to this,

308
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:58,060
why do it in the first place?

309
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:00,460
I know, it's all my fault.

310
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:02,820
But please,

311
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:04,620
save Yun'er, please.

312
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:05,540
I beg you.

313
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:08,220
I beg you all.

314
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:09,100
I beg you.

315
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:10,380
Please save Yun'er.

316
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:12,900
Please, save her.

317
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:21,780
Yun'er.

318
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:22,940
Your mom is here.

319
00:20:23,270 --> 00:20:24,220
Can you open the door?

320
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:26,340
Yun'er.

321
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:27,860
Mom is here.

322
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:43,460
Yun'er.

323
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:46,940
It's all my fault.

324
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:48,860
Mom.

325
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:52,420
Captain Ye.

326
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:54,780
Let my mom go.

327
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:57,100
I'll go with you.

328
00:20:57,660 --> 00:20:58,580
Yun'er.

329
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:01,220
You know we can't agree to that.

330
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:09,060
Then leave.

331
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:12,820
Yun'er, Yun'er.

332
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:14,100
Yun'er.

333
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:18,260
Please.

334
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:20,380
Listen to the police.

335
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:22,300
It doesn't matter for me.

336
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:23,900
I deserve to die.

337
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:25,620
But not you,

338
00:21:26,270 --> 00:21:28,250
none of this is your fault.

339
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:29,420
Yun'er.

340
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:34,140
In the past,

341
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:35,900
I also wanted to be

342
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:37,660
an innocent,

343
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:39,380
cheerful

344
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:41,140
and sunny girl.

345
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:43,900
But later I realized

346
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:45,940
life didn't give me that choice.

347
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:49,140
Because I'm the daughter of

348
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:52,300
Chen Yuanhang and Ai Lian.

349
00:21:56,980 --> 00:21:57,900
Mom.

350
00:21:58,340 --> 00:21:59,260
I know

351
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:00,420
you might go to prison,

352
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:02,620
and maybe

353
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:05,900
we'll never see each other again.

354
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:09,100
But seeing you today

355
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:11,540
is enough.

356
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:19,460
Mom.

357
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:21,780
Captain Ye.

358
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:24,060
You can go now.

359
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:29,500
Tata.

360
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:33,020
Thank you.

361
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:35,780
Yun'er.

362
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:39,340
Yun'er!

363
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:40,660
Let the police remove the bomb,

364
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:42,740
or I'll die in front of you.

365
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:44,620
- Mom.
- It's not worth it for me.

366
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:47,700
Let the police remove it!

367
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:48,780
Mom.

368
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:53,020
Do you really have to be this cruel?

369
00:22:57,660 --> 00:22:59,380
Dad already died right in front of me.

370
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:03,320
Do you want me to go through that again?

371
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:04,740
I want you to live!

372
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:06,580
Then why did you do all this?

373
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:23,700
Why?

374
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:25,980
I was wrong.

375
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:31,220
I was wrong, Yun'er.

376
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:39,380
But Yun'er,

377
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:42,940
you can't punish me with your own life.

378
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:44,220
I can't bear it.

379
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:48,820
I was wrong.

380
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:09,540
Captain Ye.

381
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:11,780
I know my daughter.

382
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:14,100
She'll go along with a plan.

383
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:16,220
As long as we can save her,

384
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:19,300
let this be my redemption.

385
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:20,220
Can we try?
