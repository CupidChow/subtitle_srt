Where is my child?

27
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:39,240
Captain, Sun Xiaolei's parents are here.

28
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:41,600
- My child!
- Xiaolei!

29
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:42,840
Mom.

30
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:44,490
- My child.
- Mom.

31
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:45,440
- My child!
- Xiaolei.

32
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:46,280
My child!

33
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:47,320
Mom!

34
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:48,340
You can't go in right now.

35
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:49,760
Let go of me.

36
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:51,160
You can't go in right now.

37
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:52,640
This will hinder our progress.

38
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,800
My child!

39
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:57,520
Weiwei.

40
00:01:58,440 --> 00:01:59,880
You are also a victim.

41
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,480
Your parents abandoned you
when you were little.

42
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,400
Your grandma who raised you passed away.

43
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,640
You should be able to understand

44
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:10,240
the pain of losing your family.

45
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:12,600
Can you bear to let Xiaolei

46
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,960
suffer the same pain?

47
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,400
Mom!

48
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,480
Look at her, so young,

49
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:18,520
so cute.

50
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,360
The person you trust is a drug dealer.

51
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,240
He has already been caught by us.

52
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:28,200
Here, take a look.

53
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,000
Is it him?

54
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,600
You should know the harm

55
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,200
drugs do to people, right?

56
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,200
To him,

57
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,200
you are just tools
to exchange for drug money.

58
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:46,840
Sister.

59
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,400
Come with us.

60
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,920
Let's go home together.

61
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,160
Go home?

62
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,440
Where is home?

63
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:03,560
If you have no place to live,
come to my house.

64
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,960
My house is big.

65
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:07,440
My parents will take care of you.

66
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:10,160
They can also be your parents.

67
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,640
The people inside!

68
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,600
Please, let my daughter go!

69
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,040
She is our only child.

70
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,200
If something happens to her,

71
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,800
how will we live?

72
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:28,760
I beg you.

73
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:30,440
Please let my daughter go.

74
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:33,680
- I'll give you whatever you want.
- Xiaolei, An'an.

75
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,880
Please let her go.

76
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:35,920
I beg you.

77
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:36,960
Leave now.

78
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:39,020
I beg you.

79
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:46,960
Weiwei.

80
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,040
What are you going to do?

81
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,560
Where is my home?

82
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:56,220
(Yu Weiwei's poetry collection)
Who am I?

83
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,240
I am everything I can perceive.

84
00:03:58,680 --> 00:03:59,600
Who am I?

85
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,560
I am everything I can perceive.

86
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:06,640
Who am I?

87
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,640
I am the reflection in your eyes.

88
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,160
Who am I, really?

89
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,680
I may not be anyone.

90
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,960
If I could be reborn,

91
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,280
I would hope

92
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:27,880
to become a light, shimmering firefly,

93
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,040
or maybe a candlelight.

94
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,280
- Even if it's faint,
- Even if it's faint,

95
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:37,580
- it would still warm.
- it would still warm.

96
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,440
This is the poem you wrote

97
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:43,680
for the competition, remember?

98
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,360
Even though life has been unfair to you,

99
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,200
you still hope

100
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,960
to bring warmth to those around you.

101
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:54,680
You did it.

102
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,040
No matter what happened just now,

103
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,320
before this,

104
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:01,800
you were always taking care of Xiaolei

105
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:02,840
and An'an.

106
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:04,800
Right?

107
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,560
I also heard about a poem.

108
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:11,680
You must have heard of it too.

109
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:13,480
With one bit of heat,

110
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,640
give off one bit of light.

111
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,080
Like a firefly,

112
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,160
giving off a bit of light

113
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:24,920
in the darkness.

114
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,440
No need to wait for a torch.

115
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:31,800
From now on,

116
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,760
if there is no torch,

117
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,080
I will be the only light.

It's fine.

128
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,280
It's just a flesh wound.

129
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,160
That little girl's mom

130
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:46,840
is the one who feels the greatest pain.

131
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,080
It's fine.

132
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:50,680
How cruel

133
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:54,080
can a person really be?

134
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,720
There is darkness in human nature.

135
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,600
We must face it.

136
00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:00,810
But every time something like this happens,

137
00:07:01,590 --> 00:07:02,840
it still weighs on my heart.

138
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:09,080
The darkness is bottomless.

139
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,540
But we must still believe in the light.

140
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,080
Just like Yu Weiwei.

141
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,000
Yes.

142
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,640
She will get better and better.

00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:26,640

145
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,640
Is it okay to grill meat at home?

146
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:44,000
Won't the smell be too strong?

147
00:07:44,010 --> 00:07:44,920
It's fine.

148
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,880
Anyway, my parents went on vacation.

149
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,720
Wen they come back,
the smell will have dispersed.

150
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,600
When the cat's away,

151
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,960
the mice will play.

152
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:54,520
Or we could go out to eat.

153
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:56,080
Do you think your mom will be angry?

154
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,320
Don't spoil the fun.

155
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:01,120
I've been waiting for this hotpot and BBQ.

156
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,080
Finally, we've got to eat it.

157
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,960
They might come back and scold you.

158
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:06,110
Impossible.

159
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,400
Mrs. Lin wouldn't be that harsh.

160
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,480
She can't bear to do that.

161
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,840
Your parents are really close.

162
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:14,760
Not that close.

163
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,400
Take it.

164
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,880
- Tata.
- Cheers.

165
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:20,960
Why are you silent?

166
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,480
I'm hungry.

167
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:47,120
Dad.

168
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,080
Drinking tea?

169
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,600
Why are you out so late?

170
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,520
Where are you going?

171
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,520
I'm just throwing out the trash.

172
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,240
Throwing out the trash?

173
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,120
Wait a minute.

174
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,360
Here's more.

175
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,320
Throw this out too.

176
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:08,600
Okay.

177
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,800
Dad, after I throw out the trash,

178
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,160
I want to run for a bit.

179
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:14,680
You sleep first, don't wait for me.

180
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,960
When did my daughter

181
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,200
become so disciplined?

182
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:21,840
Well, I am your daughter after all.

183
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,440
I have to learn from you.

184
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:26,200
Don't you always say I'm too weak?

185
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,360
Shouldn't I be supposed to practice more?

186
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:29,560
See you, Dad.

187
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:33,720
Alright.

188
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,280
Tonight,

189
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:36,360
you don't need to run.

190
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:37,720
Tomorrow morning,

191
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,200
we'll start training

192
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:40,760
two hours earlier.

193
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:42,880
At 4:30 AM.

194
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,520
Be on time for exercises.

195
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,600
Go throw out the trash, then go to sleep.

196
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:04,160
Hello?

197
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,360
I can't make it.

198
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,160
Mr. Lin said training starts at

199
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,640
4:30 tomorrow morning.

200
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:13,320
If I find you guys now,

201
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:15,280
I'll need to rush back tonight.

202
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,360
It smells so good.

203
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,360
So delicious.

204
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,160
Can you guys stop being like this?

205
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:25,600
In my situation,

206
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,240
aren't you going to comfort me at all?

207
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:30,800
Just wait and see.

208
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:31,720
One day,

209
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,520
I'll escape from Mr. Lin's control.

210
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:35,760
Alright, alright.

211
00:10:35,770 --> 00:10:37,280
We'll wait for that day.

212
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,160
It smells so good.

213
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,760
How long until it's ready?

214
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:49,920
Soon. It's almost ready.

215
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:50,760
Soon.

216
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:51,720
I'll eat this first.

217
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,580
- Let's eat more for Wanru.
- This one's ready.

218
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:47,720
You're back.

219
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:51,840
It's already dawn.

220
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,080
What time is it?

221
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,680
It's almost 7:30.

222
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,120
You haven't had breakfast, right?

223
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,560
I made it for you yesterday.

224
00:11:58,560 --> 00:11:59,600
I'll go heat it up for you.

225
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:11,380
(Emergency Response Training Base)

226
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:15,160
One, two, three!

227
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:22,840
Once we master it,

228
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:24,400
it feels really cool.

229
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:26,680
You're full of it.

230
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:28,520
You always say that after every training.

231
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:30,440
What about you?

232
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:33,560
You always say you're swift and agile,

233
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:36,240
like a living swallow

234
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,760
and the modern female Ye Wen.

235
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:43,680
Am I like Ye Wen?

236
00:12:44,090 --> 00:12:45,660
- Do I look like Ye Wen?
- Stop joking.

237
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:47,040
Captain.

238
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:48,040
Captain.

239
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:49,640
Sit down. Let's have some water.

240
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:51,120
- Thanks, Captain.
- Take it.

241
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,040
Thanks, Captain.

242
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:55,360
I've got some good news for all of you.

243
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:56,600
Yu Weiwei's mom

244
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,040
has settled everything at home.

245
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:59,410
She's ready to bring her back home.

246
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:01,080
Also, both sides of the parents

247
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,760
have guaranteed the team leaders

248
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,080
that they will make sure
Weiwei goes to college.

249
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,520
They'll share the difficulties

250
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:08,200
and help her through this sensitive period.

251
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:09,400
At times like these,

252
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:10,910
I feel so proud to be a police officer.

253
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:13,320
It feels really great
to be able to help others.

254
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,240
Yes.

255
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,080
My parents are both police officers.

256
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,720
When I was little, I never understood

257
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:19,840
why they never had time to spend with me.

258
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,280
Now that I'm a police officer too,

259
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,600
I finally understand them.

260
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:28,960
Tata.

261
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:31,640
Why are you silent again?

262
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:35,990
It's good.

263
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:38,240
Tata.

264
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,710
- Where are you going?
- What are you doing?

265
00:13:39,710 --> 00:13:40,560
What?

266
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:41,480
Extra training.

267
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:43,400
Extra training?

268
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:44,880
You're just gonna watch?

269
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:46,640
Captain.

270
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:47,560
Captain, we...

271
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:48,680
My leg...

272
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:52,620
(Shooting in progress)

273
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:55,040
We're equipped with various firearms

274
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,880
and have trained in their use.

275
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:59,320
But I hope you'll learn more

276
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:01,000
how to avoid using them.

277
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:02,480
Everyone should understand

278
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:03,680
our goal

279
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,240
is never to shoot,

280
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,360
but to save lives.

281
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:07,680
Even if we shoot,

282
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,280
it's to stop killing.

283
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,000
If we didn't have weapons today,

284
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,500
could we complete the mission?

285
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,200
The answer is yes.

286
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,680
We need to train our judgment

287
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,480
by observing the words
and actions of the target

288
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,320
to understand their demands,

289
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,080
weaknesses, and concerns.

290
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,760
Our superiors have
the highest expectations for us.

291
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:30,160
We aim not only to be
the strongest all-female team,

292
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,920
but the strongest patrol police team.

293
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,640
- Can we do it?
- Yes.

294
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,400
We should be strong.

295
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,120
Not just strong in physical fitness

296
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,080
and tactics,

297
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,860
(Hummer Commandos)

298
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:41,400
but also

299
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:42,640
in thinking,

300
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:43,560
psychology,

301
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,280
endurance and resilience.

302
00:14:45,730 --> 00:14:46,600
Every day,

303
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,800
we must have the courage
to push ourselves to the limit.

304
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,360
Only then,

305
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:51,800
when the mission gets tough,

306
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,440
can we handle it with ease.

307
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,280
Only then can we say,

308
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,120
we can protect

309
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,240
the lives and property of the people.

310
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:00,240
Can we do it?

311
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,760
- Yes!
- Yes!

312
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:19,220
(Shooting Target)

313
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:24,740
(Shooting Target)

314
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:28,060
(Shooting Target)

315
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:51,200
How does it feel to be back?

316
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,000
It feels great.

317
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,800
I really like to work.

318
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:57,400
I can tell.

319
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:07,900
(Empty, Binjiang TAXI)

320
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:17,240
The car has lost control!

321
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:18,360
Get out of the way!

322
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,600
Stop! Stop!

323
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,040
Sir!

324
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:28,960
Sir, what happened?

325
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,120
Are you okay?

326
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,240
Are you alright?

327
00:16:33,010 --> 00:16:34,080
Don't you look at the road?

328
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:35,000
Come back!

329
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,080
Officer.

330
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,080
Hurry, catch him!

331
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,000
He stole my stuff!

332
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,120
Stop!

333
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,110
Stop!

334
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,240
Don't run!

335
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:54,200
Stop!

336
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:56,640
Stop, don't move.

337
00:16:56,790 --> 00:16:58,040
Where do you think you're going?

338
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:58,760
Fraud!

339
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:00,240
You stole my stuff and insulted me!

340
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:01,660
I was just joking.

341
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:02,750
Do you not understand humor?

342
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:03,880
What's going on?

343
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:05,320
I arranged it online with him.

344
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:06,360
He gave me 800 yuan

345
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:07,750
to buy my limited edition game card.

346
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:10,520
No problem, right?

347
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:11,640
This is a limited edition.

348
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:12,720
It's been hard to find.

349
00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:13,840
Nice.

350
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:14,760
We agreed.

351
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:16,680
Cash for goods, right?

352
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:26,100
(Big fool)

353
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:29,440
Fraud!

354
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:30,480
Stop right there!

355
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:33,120
He took the game card

356
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,760
and left me with a bunch of blank paper.

357
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:35,960
Forget it, it's not a big deal.

358
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,360
Consider it a loan.

359
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:38,680
I'll pay you back when I have the money.

360
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:39,600
No.

361
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,400
I'll give it back to you now.

362
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:43,880
It's too late now.

363
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,000
Officer.

364
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,400
I told him to stop, but he wouldn't.

365
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:48,060
Isn't that robbery?

366
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:49,400
Robbery?

367
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,240
Can you just say it's robbery?

368
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:52,400
If you go against someone's will

369
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,240
and take their belongings, that's robbery.

370
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:55,600
Is it really that serious?

371
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:57,880
Come with us.

372
00:17:58,280 --> 00:17:59,360
- My sister...
- Let's go.

373
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:00,540
My sister is a police officer.

374
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,360
Tang Xin, one of the Hummer Commandos.

375
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:03,280
Do you know her?

376
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:06,480
Let's go.

377
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:19,760
Xin, let me take over.

378
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,440
How are you feeling now?

379
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:40,920
Where does it hurt?

380
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:00,920
Alright, alright.

381
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:02,320
Everyone, you can leave now.

382
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,160
Xin.

383
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:15,180
Were you thinking about your dad just now?

384
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,360
Driving a taxi is really tough.

385
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:21,760
My dad is like that.

386
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,280
He works from 6 AM

387
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:25,320
until 7 PM.

388
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,360
13 hours a day.

389
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,960
Except for eating and bathroom breaks,

390
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,520
he just sits stiffly in the car.

391
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:35,640
But now I'm working.

392
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:36,960
He doesn't have to work that hard.

393
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,240
You've grown up.

394
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:44,720
If your dad knew

395
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,960
you saved a taxi driver today,

396
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,240
he would be so happy.

397
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,920
He'll probably make you some chicken soup.

398
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,320
I think that's a good idea.

399
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:53,610
I'll tell him when I get back.

400
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:56,400
I envy you.

401
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,080
Your dad treats you so well.

402
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,040
Look at my dad.

403
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:00,680
He's so strict with me.

404
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:02,600
He's never satisfied with anything I do.

405
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,200
He has high expectations for you.

406
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:07,280
I hope so.

407
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,120
Hello?

408
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,560
Alright, we'll leave now.

409
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:21,680
- Thank you.
- Xin, help!

410
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:23,240
- Let's go.
- Xin.

411
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:24,400
Don't go.

412
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:25,920
Aren't you so tough?

413
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,240
Tang Xin.

414
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:28,080
How are you going

415
00:20:28,090 --> 00:20:29,640
to explain to my mom?

416
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,340
How are you going to explain to my uncle?

417
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,320
Off work.

418
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:35,720
I don't know, let's search it.

419
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:36,640
I want to eat...

420
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:37,560
Hello, Captain Zhu!

421
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:38,680
Captain Zhu.

422
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,040
What are you doing here?

423
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:42,060
I won't be working late today.

424
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,840
Didn't you want something good to eat?

425
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,200
I've booked a table.

426
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,120
That's great.

427
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:47,560
I'll leave now.

428
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:48,560
Have a good rest.

429
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:49,400
Have a nice weekend.

430
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,320
Bye!

431
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,200
We're not bringing you guys to the date.

432
00:20:52,470 --> 00:20:53,320
Bye!

433
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:00,880
They're such a sweet couple.

434
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:05,160
Makes me want to fall in love.

435
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:06,560
Go ahead.

436
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:08,240
I also want to see you fall in love.

437
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:09,640
Go for it.

438
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:11,160
But I think I'll pass.

439
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:12,040
I can't even imagine

440
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:13,560
what my relationship would be like.

441
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:15,640
Don't be shy, set an example for us.

442
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,400
Why should I set an example?

443
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:18,680
You should set an example too.

444
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:20,280
I think it's you who wants to fall in love.

445
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:21,560
Alright, stop it.

446
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:26,200
Xin, what are you thinking about?

447
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:27,240
Nothing.

448
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,000
I really don't want to go home lately.

449
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:33,360
Mrs. Lin is forcing me to go on blind dates.

450
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:34,400
It's so annoying.

451
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:35,960
Just be contented.

452
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:38,200
Your parents are so open-minded.

453
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,320
Not like my family.

454
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:40,600
It's always so cold at home.

455
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:42,880
My dad only tells me

456
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:44,760
to do extra training endlessly.

457
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:47,040
A cold atmosphere is fine.

458
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,920
My family doesn't even live in Binjiang.

459
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,520
I miss my mom.

460
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:53,880
Come here.

461
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:54,800
Call me Mom.

462
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:55,920
Go away.

463
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:57,800
Hurry up, call me Mom.

464
00:21:58,320 --> 00:21:59,240
What mom?

465
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:04,240
Silly.

466
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:28,480
You're still not asleep?

467
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:45,320
It's 10:20 PM.

468
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,040
40 more minutes left.

469
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:53,200
The leisure time only for us.

470
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:57,200
Wait a moment.

471
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:10,040
What?

472
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:12,640
The movie "Ghost".

473
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:15,040
This song is unlucky.

474
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:16,240
Let me change it.

475
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,800
Aren't you tired of it?

476
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:24,800
Here we go.

477
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:31,800
It's been more than half a month already.

478
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:43,240
I, uh...

479
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:44,680
I'm a little sleepy.

480
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:46,040
I'll sleep first.

481
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:50,280
You should sleep earlier too.

482
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:00,280
You're tired?

483
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:03,080
Alright.

484
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:05,680
Rest well.

485
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:15,880
I'm not bragging about our daughter,

486
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,960
but Xin is the first one in our family

487
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:19,320
to be on government payroll.

488
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:21,800
It's worth it.

489
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:23,940
Do you know how hard it is
to become a police officer?

490
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,040
Her dad and I told her

491
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:27,160
to just give up.

492
00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:29,140
But Xin was determined.

493
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:30,680
And she really made it.

494
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:31,720
Of course she did.

495
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:33,880
Getting in is one thing,

496
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:35,120
but do you know?

497
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:36,760
After Xin joined the SWAT team,

498
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:38,080
in less than a year,

499
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:39,800
she was chosen by the

500
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:43,000
Hummer Commandos.

501
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:44,150
Hummer Commandos.

502
00:25:44,150 --> 00:25:45,160
Do you know what that is?

503
00:25:45,270 --> 00:25:46,140
Well,

504
00:25:46,150 --> 00:25:47,030
let's put it this way.

505
00:25:47,030 --> 00:25:48,480
She's the elite of the elites.

506
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:52,480
Incredible.

507
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:54,400
I've always thought Xin was amazing.

508
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:58,040
Xin.

509
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:01,040
Auntie.

510
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:14,360
Xin.

511
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:16,800
You have to save your cousin.

512
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:19,360
Auntie.

513
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,920
What can I do?

514
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:22,600
How can you not do anything?

515
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:24,040
You guys caught him.

516
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:26,360
Can't you pull some strings?

517
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:27,920
- Auntie, I can't.
- Xin.

518
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:29,160
It's all up to you now.

519
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:30,480
Your brother is still in school.

520
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:31,560
He can't have a criminal record.

521
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:33,400
Tang Xin, you're successful now.

522
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:34,920
You can't ignore your family, right?

523
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:35,840
Yes, Xin.

524
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:37,160
Please save your brother.

525
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:38,880
Your dad says your boss values you.

526
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,440
You're about to be promoted to captain.

527
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:42,600
If you bring this up,
they'll definitely agree.

528
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:43,560
Yes.

529
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:45,840
The food's ready, let's eat.

530
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:47,200
Come, come, come, eat.

531
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,880
Dad, don't say such things.

532
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:50,080
I'm the most junior in the team.

533
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:51,440
How could I be the captain?

534
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:54,880
I...

535
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:58,040
I didn't mean right now.

536
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,360
With your abilities,

537
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:01,280
they'll definitely

538
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:03,560
promote you in the years to come.

539
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:04,780
They'll definitely promote you.

540
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:05,720
Xin,

541
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:07,160
this is not a big deal.

542
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:08,320
I believe in your abilities.

543
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:09,160
You'll make it.

544
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:10,440
- Dad.
- It'll be okay.

545
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:11,360
Dad.

546
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:12,440
I'm a patrol special police.

547
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:13,560
I don't handle cases.

548
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:15,520
I can't do this.

549
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:24,000
Xin,

550
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:25,640
what do you mean?

551
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:28,600
You want me to beg you, don't you?

552
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:33,240
Then I will kneel and beg you, okay?

553
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:34,520
Dad!

554
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:36,240
What are you doing?

555
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:39,520
This is a mess.

556
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:40,960
What should we do?

557
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:42,880
This child, look at her.

558
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:15,080
What is this new play?

559
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:17,560
Please, help me.

560
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:18,680
Pretty creative, huh?

561
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:19,600
Help me, please.

562
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,760
Help me, help me, please.

563
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,560
Help me, I can't take it.

564
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:36,120
Learning how to quit drugs?

565
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:42,320
Impressive, bro.

566
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:44,280
How's the detox going?

567
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:45,840
Did you quit?

568
00:28:46,610 --> 00:28:47,480
Help!

569
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:48,660
Help me, help me!

570
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:50,440
You're really out of it?

571
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:52,400
Come on, come on.

572
00:28:52,550 --> 00:28:53,420
Please!

573
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:58,000
I'll give you, I'll give you.

574
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,000
Please.

575
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:00,640
You beg me. Beg me.

576
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:01,680
Please, please.

577
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:03,480
- What?
- It hurts, it hurts.

578
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:05,880
- Quickly, beg me.
- I beg you, I beg you.

579
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:08,680
I'm asking you to kneel and beg me.

580
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,520
Okay, I'm begging you.

581
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:12,840
Help me.

582
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:13,760
Please, please.

583
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:16,400
Please.

584
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:19,600
Please.

585
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:21,280
I beg you, I beg you.

586
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:23,920
Stop pretending.

587
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:38,940
(Policewoman's Mini-Class)

588
00:29:39,410 --> 00:29:41,100
(Policewoman's Mini-Class)
Kids, remember,

589
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:42,450
be cautious with unfamiliar people.

590
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:44,310
When a stranger asks for directions,

591
00:29:44,310 --> 00:29:47,160
just say you don't know.

592
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,910
Look up, walk quickly.

593
00:29:48,910 --> 00:29:50,810
Catch up with the kids ahead.

594
00:29:52,090 --> 00:29:53,760
If you get lost, don't panic.

595
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:56,340
Remember your street and house number.

596
00:29:56,810 --> 00:29:58,310
If you're home alone,

597
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:00,760
don't answer the door for strangers.

598
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:02,960
If a stranger offers snacks,

599
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:05,540
don't take them. Don't be greedy.

600
00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:08,420
Teenagers are passionate and reckless,

601
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:10,380
(Big fool)
Their self-control is often weak.

602
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:12,060
They must know where the boundaries are,

603
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:13,060
and what the consequences are.

604
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:14,860
This is very important.

605
00:30:15,140 --> 00:30:16,350
So we must set a good example

606
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:18,160
and be their role model.

607
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:19,960
Build a network of education

608
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:21,900
that connects schools, families, and society

609
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:23,700
to protect the healthy growth

610
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:24,660
