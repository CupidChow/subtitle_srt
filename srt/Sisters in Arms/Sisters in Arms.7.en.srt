24
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,320
What's going on?

25
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,320
They're being very cautious now,

26
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:41,680
daring not do anything.

27
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:43,520
However,

28
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:44,880
I heard there's someone called Wu

29
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:46,480
who has a big batch of goods.

30
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,560
He might come to Binjiang
for the deal.

31
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,040
Let me know as soon as
you get any confirmation.

32
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:58,560
Okay.

33
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:11,800
You haven't relapsed, huh?

34
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:14,240
No.

35
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,680
If you dare relapse,

36
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,600
I won't let you off.

37
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:19,360
Don't worry.

38
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:20,480
For my mom,

39
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,640
I won't do it again.

40
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,360
The check, please.

41
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:39,020
(Police)

42
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,680
Washing the car makes you this happy?

43
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,360
Yeah.

44
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,000
Group activities are the best.

45
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,760
If they don't make her
go on blind dates,

46
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:22,560
she's happy doing anything, right?

47
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,440
Ms. Lin has been too difficult lately.

48
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:27,960
Xin, you're on a day off.

49
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,280
Why aren't you going home?

50
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,560
My parents are traveling.

51
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,920
It's boring going back alone.

52
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,880
Can they bear to let you

53
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,120
stay home alone?

54
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:38,120
They've changed a lot recently.

55
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,640
They really understand me now,

56
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:42,280
said they can't focus
all their energy on me.

57
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,520
They need their own lives.

58
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,680
My mom even wants to enroll in senior college

59
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,120
to cultivate some hobbies.

60
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:54,280
Xin, how did you convince them?

61
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,480
Teach me how to do it.

62
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:56,680
It's actually not that hard.

63
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:57,960
If they disagree,

64
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,680
I just act spoiled and stubborn.

65
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,760
If that doesn't work, I cry on them.

66
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,200
Seriously?

67
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,240
This was actually inspired by Danyang.

68
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:13,080
What's wrong with me?

69
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:14,880
Now I realize

70
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:15,840
that home isn't a place

71
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:16,840
where logic works.

72
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:17,800
As long as parents know

73
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,120
I love them and care about them,

74
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,040
everything will be solved.

75
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,960
Let me summarize for you.

76
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,120
If being spoiled can solve it,

77
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,640
there's no need for logic.

78
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:27,560
That's right.

79
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,280
Hey, Dad.

80
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,240
Why haven't you come home yet?

81
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:46,080
Dad, can I stay out today?

82
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:47,600
No way.

83
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:53,800
Dad.

84
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:57,640
What happened to your throat?

85
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:02,840
Well...

86
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:07,240
Nothing. Just choked a little.

87
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,720
Let me remind you,

88
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:10,600
if you're not back within half an hour,

89
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,800
you'll get extra training.

90
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,280
Dad.

91
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,800
Good, good.

92
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:44,440
Quick, quick, speed up.

93
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,600
Keep the strength, hold on.

94
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,240
Only one minute left.

95
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,160
Speed up.

96
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:50,560
Watch your strength.

97
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,400
Speed up.

98
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,480
Faster, faster, faster.

99
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,400
Even faster!

100
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,480
Still not up to standard.

101
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,760
We still need to increase
training intensity.

102
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:02,680
Dad.

103
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,360
I'm a girl.

104
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,240
You can't hold me

105
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,480
to a boy's standard.

106
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:09,160
Police don't identify as male or female,

107
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,680
only qualified or not.

108
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:13,920
I graduated top of the police academy.

109
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,240
I even won first place in

110
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,720
the provincial bomb disposal contest.

111
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:19,120
I also ranked high
in the police competitions.

112
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,040
Am I still not qualified?

113
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:25,760
Is that all you aim for?

114
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,840
Why can't you ever recognize me?

115
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,920
Am I really that much of a letdown?

116
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:34,800
Let's eat first.

Dinner's ready.

123
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,000
Come inside and eat.

124
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:02,480
Dad.

125
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,400
Dad.

126
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:11,400
Why are you always so mean to me?

127
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,000
Look at other dads.

128
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,960
They always spoil their kids

129
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,840
and give they everything they want.

130
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:19,000
But look at you.

131
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:23,840
What do you want?

132
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,360
Just say it.

133
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:29,160
Can I just come back once a month?

134
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,040
Is that okay?

135
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:30,960
No way.

136
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:35,240
I knew this day would come.

137
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,440
Didn't I tell you before?

138
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:39,760
If you want to be a cop,

139
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,360
you have to accept my special training.

140
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:42,560
What?

141
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,960
Can't take it now?

142
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,040
Trying to run away?

143
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,520
I'm not.

144
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:48,800
Good then.

145
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,480
Eat.

146
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:56,760
Comparisons are truly odious.

147
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:04,960
Han Ning.

148
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:08,680
Han Ning.

149
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,600
I made your favorite egg noodles.

150
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,520
I don't like egg noodles.

151
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:18,560
Don't be mad.

152
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,880
I know I was wrong.

153
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,560
You want money, right?
I'll give it to you.

154
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,120
Is one thousand enough?

155
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:29,440
Take it, take it.

156
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:34,680
Han Ning.

157
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:36,720
Don't do this again, okay?

158
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:38,720
You really scared me.

159
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,760
You know Mom can't stomach this.

160
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:44,280
You were such a good kid.

161
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,360
Everyone loved you.

162
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:57,460

164
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:03,320
Hello?

165
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,240
Tingting.

166
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,560
Han Ning, I thought about it.

167
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:06,800
Maybe you shouldn't go.

168
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,000
It's too risky.

169
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,640
Don't be foolish.

170
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:11,000
Once I deliver the goods,

171
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,360
I can get 100,000 yuan.

172
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,840
This is the best opportunity.

173
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,560
Do you know what you're delivering?

174
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:16,880
Don't say. I don't want to know.

175
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:18,320
I only care if they

176
00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:19,440
keep their promises.

177
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:22,840
Sorry.

178
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,040
Tingting.

179
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:27,720
Do you love me?

180
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,360
Of course, I love you.

181
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,440
Then that's enough.

182
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:45,220
(Answer, Decline)

183
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:46,760
Hello?

184
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:47,840
Nanmen Wholesale Market.

185
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:54,620
(What Hotel)

186
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:55,480
Captain Zhu.

187
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:57,560
Is the news from Hei reliable?

188
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,480
We've been waiting here for two days.

189
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:00,400
No one is here.

190
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,360
Hei has never made a mistake

191
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:03,880
these years.

192
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,400
I suspect this Wu

193
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,920
is the one that slipped through the cracks.

194
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:12,120
Recently, we have made some attractive moves,

195
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:13,200
and destroyed a hideout.

196
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,360
Now, these devils are about to be exposed.

197
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:18,600
I think

198
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,040
timing is perfect

199
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,840
for Wu's appearance.

200
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:31,960
Chen, Chen.

201
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,400
What's going on with you?

202
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:34,880
Captain Zhu,

203
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,960
so far, there's nothing going on here.

204
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,240
Remember,

205
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,600
our purpose this time

206
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:40,760
isn't to make arrests.

207
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,400
Just keep an eye on it.

208
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:43,480
I want to see

209
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:46,200
if we can catch a big fish.

210
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,760
Don't alert them.

211
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:49,680
Got it.

212
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:51,680
Wu.

213
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:52,920
The delivery guy is coming out.

214
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,520
Nanmen Wholesale Market.

215
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:58,960
Keep an eye on him.

216
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,080
See if someone's following him.

217
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,280
Got it.

218
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,480
Wenzi, here.

219
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:21,060
(What Hotel)

220
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,160
At Minzhu East Street's corner.

221
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,320
In the trash can.

222
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:35,920
Where exactly?

223
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:02,180
(Police, Hummer Commandos)

224
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:53,480
Hello?

225
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,440
I've got the goods.

226
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:56,640
In What hotel.

227
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:58,400
What?

228
00:12:58,560 --> 00:12:59,520
Which hotel?

229
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,920
The hotel's name is What Hotel.

230
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,000
Got it.

231
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,080
Wenzi.

232
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,000
Is Wu not coming?

233
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:18,900
(What Hotel)

234
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,160
The person you spoke with is suspicious.

235
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:28,480
Search him.

236
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:30,600
(What Hotel)
Wenzi.

237
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:31,680
Wenzi.

238
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,160
Wenzi.

239
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:46,920
Wenzi.

240
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:57,480
Kill him.

241
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:01,000
Make sure he's dead.

242
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:07,160
The informant's in trouble.

243
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:08,920
Action!

244
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:10,280
Everyone, get ready to move.

245
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:11,360
Go.

246
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:45,960
Boss, it's bad.

247
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:46,880
The police are here.

248
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:05,200
- Where's Wenzi?
- Wenzi has already run.

249
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:06,920
Notify the others to retreat.

250
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:07,840
Okay.

251
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:25,520
Hei.

252
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:26,720
Are you okay?

253
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:28,760
Hurry, hospital now.

254
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:29,680
Take him down.

255
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:28,620
(Police, Binjiang, Hummer Commandos)

256
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:32,760
Hummer Commandos, attention.

257
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:33,800
Please head to

258
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,920
What Hotel, No.134 on Donglin Road.

259
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:37,480
Assist in the narcotics team's arrest.

260
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:38,400
Copy that.

261
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:00,160
They ran from the back alley.

262
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:01,280
Block it.

263
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:22,000
Stop!

264
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:28,240
Stay still!

265
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:30,880
Stop!

266
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:31,960
Stop!

267
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:39,200
Stop!

268
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,360
Don't move.

269
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:23,760
Don't run.

270
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:28,400
Stop!

271
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,560
Don't run! I'll shoot if you run.

272
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:44,040
Turn around slowly.

273
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:46,840
Turn around.

274
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:01,240
Are you alright?

275
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:03,000
I'm fine. Let's chase.

276
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:04,360
Hurry!

277
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,040
What's going on?

278
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:08,440
Captain.

279
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:10,640
The suspect is fleeing
toward Ximen Street.

280
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:12,360
The shooting location

281
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:13,720
is unclear.

282
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:14,880
Are there any casualties?

283
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,040
No casualties.

284
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:17,680
I've got a minor injury.

285
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:18,960
Alright, fall back.

286
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:46,000
Drive.

287
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:55,640
Okay, got it.

288
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:58,040
What's going on?

289
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:00,040
Captain Zhu,
according to their statements,

290
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:02,720
one of the leaders
called Wenzi has escaped.

291
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:03,640
Alright, I understand.

292
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:04,500
Medical team.

293
00:20:04,510 --> 00:20:05,360
Captain Zhu,

294
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:06,920
we found a tablet in the next room.

295
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:08,840
You can see the situation in Hei's room.

296
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:17,000
Do you remember the person
who wore a denim jacket

297
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,120
when we went upstairs?

298
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:30,280
That person is Wu?

299
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
I think it's possible.

300
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:34,080
Dajun, Dajun.

301
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,280
Organize a search immediately.

302
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:36,480
Block all the intersections.

303
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:38,080
He didn't get the goods.

304
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,120
He shouldn't have gone far.

305
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:47,980
(Police)

306
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:55,200
Turn right.

307
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:08,960
Turn right again.

308
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,200
Go to the basement.

309
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,120
You can't take this.

310
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:46,160
You won't dare shoot.

311
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,520
The police are after you.

312
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:48,720
Shoot me,

313
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:50,080
then you're the dead meat.

314
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:54,080
Do I really need to shoot

315
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:56,280
to kill you?

316
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:57,760
Killing me is easy,

317
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:59,440
but getting out of here

318
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:00,360
won't be so simple.

319
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:04,480
Do you know what's in here?

320
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:05,760
I don't want to know.

321
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:08,040
If we get caught by the police,

322
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:10,520
I mean us,

323
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:13,480
they'll find after investigation

324
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:15,000
that you brought this here.

325
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:19,520
Do you know how many years
you'll be sentenced to?

326
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:22,840
You're the receiver?

327
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,560
Knowing too much

328
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,400
won't be good for you.

329
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:36,160
You won't kill me.

330
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:37,800
I'm still useful.

331
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:42,240
According to Hei's information,

332
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:43,440
this person called Wenzi

333
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:45,520
should know about Wu.

334
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:47,240
They're in single-line contact.

335
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:48,760
So Wu's shot

336
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:51,200
was to deliberately let Wenzi escape.

337
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,310
This guy is experienced,

338
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:54,400
and very cautious.

339
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:55,960
No one we've caught

340
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:57,680
has seen him.

341
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:58,960
Chen is still asking,

342
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,560
but we won't get much out of them.

343
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:01,920
So far we only know

344
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,560
that the delivery driver is a man,

345
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:04,880
only Wu and Wenzi know

346
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:05,800
what car he drove,

347
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:07,440
and what features it had.

348
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:08,600
Captain Zhu.

349
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:11,120
A drug dealer just gave a clue.

350
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,480
He said Wu always wears

351
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:13,640
a gold watch.

352
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:14,880
This watch was given

353
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,560
by Huang Longfa,

354
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:17,880
whom we executed

355
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:18,880
in the Thunder Operation.

356
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,640
It is said that Wu never takes it off,

357
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:21,840
and kept for over ten years.

358
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:23,680
Is Huang Longfa his boss?

359
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,080
It seems so.

360
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,000
It's a pity Wu got away.

361
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:27,880
He won't go far.

362
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:30,040
A person can only run
about 300 meters in a minute.

363
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:31,520
While running, he'll have to hide.

364
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:32,680
There are people everywhere.

365
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:34,360
He's not just avoiding us.

366
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:35,440
He's avoiding cameras too.

367
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,080
He won't go far on foot.

368
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:42,680
Hey, Luo,

369
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:44,680
help me check

370
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:45,840
all the nearby surveillance.

371
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:48,440
Especially between 9:00 and 9:30.

372
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:51,120
Check what vehicles
passed near the hotel.

373
00:23:56,420 --> 00:23:59,460
(Integrated Police Communication System)

374
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:01,680
Wait a minute.

375
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:10,240
I've seen this car before.

376
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,640
I think I've seen it too.

377
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:12,800
At the intersection.

378
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,400
How did it get here?

379
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:16,560
HAF46807.

380
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:18,000
Last time it was seen at

381
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,440
the Sanli Road intersection.

382
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,000
It's been ten minutes since then.

383
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:23,200
If they choose to deliver here,

384
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,600
they must have surveyed the place.

385
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:27,000
They know where to avoid cameras

386
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,120
and where not to.

387
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,400
If they've hidden the goods,

388
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,520
it'll be hard for us to find.

389
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:34,120
Captain, I'm very familiar
with this area.

390
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:35,280
In our lockdown area,

391
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:37,120
there's a blind spot that evades all cameras.

392
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,880
- Where?
- A business entity under construction

393
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,120
two kilometers away.

394
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,240
There are two routes

395
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:42,560
to get there from here.

396
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:47,040
Hurry up.

397
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:51,120
Captain Song, let's split up.

398
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:53,080
Got it.

399
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,840
At the next intersection, turn left.

400
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:14,780
(Tingting)

401
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:28,520
Young man.

402
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:30,160
You're very smart.

403
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:32,480
But being too smart

404
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:34,720
isn't always a good thing.

405
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:42,560
When will you

406
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:45,320
give me the 100,000 yuan transport fee?

407
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:47,160
I'll give it to you.

408
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:49,360
Do you have a life to spend it?

409
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:51,320
If you don't give it to me,

410
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:53,240
no one will walk away alive.

411
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:55,880
I only care about the money.

412
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:57,480
I don't care who you are.

413
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:05,960
You won't get

414
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:09,240
that 100,000 yuan.

415
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
What do you mean?

416
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:14,680
We've got the owner's info.

417
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:16,720
But the car has always been
used by the owner's son.

418
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:17,840
He is called Han Ning.

419
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:20,080
20 years old and
dropped out as a kid cause of illness.

420
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,320
After that, just been jobless.

421
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:22,560
No criminal record.

422
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:25,560
Could such a young person
really be the delivery guy?

423
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:26,800
We'll know once we find him.

424
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:56,080
The tire tracks are fresh.

425
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:57,480
A car must have passed recently.

426
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:59,320
Split up and investigate.

427
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:00,400
- Yes.
- Yes.

428
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:09,000
Stop the car!

429
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:12,480
Get in the car!

430
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:13,920
Get in!

431
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:41,360
Catch up with him.

432
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:07,960
Don't move!

433
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:09,880
- Get out of the car.
- Get out!

434
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,560
Officer, don't shoot!

435
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:19,240
- Don't shoot.
- Raise your hands.

436
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:21,160
Turn around.

437
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:25,520
I don't have any weapons.

438
00:29:33,510 --> 00:29:34,360
Officer,

439
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:35,600
I don't know anything.

440
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:37,960
I was just sitting in my car, smoking.

441
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:38,960
Then someone jumped in

442
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:40,080
and pointed a gun at my head.

443
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:41,400
He said if I didn't cooperate,

444
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,400
he'd kill my family.

445
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:44,640
He made me drive forward.

446
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,240
I had to drive.
I don't know anything.

447
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:48,320
Really.

448
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,640
This boy is unlucky.

449
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:10,760
He probably resisted.

450
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:14,040
It's a reaction typical for his age.

451
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:17,740
(Ward)

452
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:19,360
But I think

453
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:21,800
Captain Zhu is right.

454
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:24,200
How did he just happen to show up?

455
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:26,960
Right at that moment.

456
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:30,190
(Ward)
Captain Zhu.

457
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:32,480
Shouldn't we interrogate him?

458
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:37,120
There's no rush.

459
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:40,840
This isn't that simple.

460
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:47,100
(Binjiang Armed Police)

461
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:49,040
Let's go back and rest for a bit.

462
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:51,040
Later, we'll visit Wanru.

463
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:54,560
Captain,

464
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:56,320
do you believe Han Ning's words?

465
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:58,400
I think it's suspicious.

466
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:01,120
He drove miles just to smoke

467
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,480
and then happened to get caught.

468
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:11,240
Did you notice his eyes?

469
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:13,480
What's wrong with his eyes?

470
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,880
His eyes were very indifferent,

471
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:20,560
with a coldness

472
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:22,200
far beyond his age.

473
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:39,640
What's wrong now?

474
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:41,440
I need to go to the temple to pray.

475
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:47,240
What's been happening recently?

476
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:49,840
Did you encounter something bad?

477
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:51,000
Stop talking nonsense.

478
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:53,040
That's just superstition.

479
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:54,440
I don't care.

480
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:56,840
As long as it helps Han Ning,
that's all that matters.

481
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:58,080
Han Ning.

482
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:01,920
- Tingting.
- How are you?

483
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:04,080
Are you okay? You scared me.

484
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:05,000
I'm fine.

485
00:32:05,170 --> 00:32:06,010
Here.

486
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:08,760
I'm a lucky guy.

487
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:10,280
What exactly happened?

488
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:11,360
Didn't you...

489
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:19,760
You two can go.

490
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:21,360
Tingting will stay with me.

491
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:22,400
That's not possible.

492
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:24,200
Your father and I aren't going anywhere.

493
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:25,520
We're staying right here with you.

494
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:27,720
It's up to you.

495
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:31,840
Han Ning, come eat an apple.

496
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:33,600
Here.

497
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:35,040
I won't eat it!

498
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:38,800
If you don't eat the apple,

499
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:40,440
I'll peel you an orange.

500
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:41,840
If you two stay here,

501
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:43,440
I won't even drink a drop of water.

502
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:47,280
Are we being bad to you?

503
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:49,640
What exactly do you want us to do?

504
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:53,400
Do you have to
make us die from frustration?

505
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:55,600
Is that what will satisfy you?

506
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:56,720
Then why did you

507
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:58,440
make me be born?

508
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:03,320
Han Ning.

509
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:05,800
You're so cold-blooded.

510
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:07,440
I should have known that...

511
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:08,360
Han.

512
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:11,960
Han Ning, don't be angry.

513
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:13,120
Your dad didn't mean it.

514
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:14,120
He's just confused.

515
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:15,840
Your dad didn't mean it.

516
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:21,520
Let's go.

517
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:22,640
Let's go back,

518
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:24,240
so we don't annoy you here.

519
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:26,360
Go.

520
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,120
Why are you doing this?

521
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:40,160
You don't understand.

522
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:48,960
I lied to the police.

523
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:51,720
What?

524
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:56,080
I let go the bad guy
