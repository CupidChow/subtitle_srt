1
00:00:37,787 --> 00:00:40,749
GOING TO YOU AT A SPEED OF 493KM

2
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:44,586
THE PLACES, PEOPLE, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTIONAL

3
00:00:46,129 --> 00:00:47,922
EPISODE 12

4
00:00:54,095 --> 00:00:55,805
Thanks for walking me home.

5
00:00:56,306 --> 00:00:57,599
I better get inside.

6
00:00:58,183 --> 00:00:59,309
What about training?

7
00:01:00,268 --> 00:01:01,478
Why don't you come back now?

8
00:01:03,354 --> 00:01:04,189
Bye.

9
00:01:07,358 --> 00:01:09,694
Taeyang, let's go to my place.

10
00:01:09,778 --> 00:01:11,905
I can't let you go like this.

11
00:01:14,824 --> 00:01:16,159
Let's be together.

12
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:27,629
I know you love me.

13
00:01:29,214 --> 00:01:31,299
Because I'm overwhelmed by your love.

14
00:01:32,133 --> 00:01:33,885
I know how you feel.

15
00:01:35,512 --> 00:01:37,055
So Taejun.

16
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:40,475
You don't have to try so hard.

17
00:01:56,407 --> 00:01:58,118
That's it for today.

18
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:01,621
What's with all this affection?

19
00:02:02,664 --> 00:02:03,748
See you.

20
00:02:09,838 --> 00:02:11,381
Answer my calls.

21
00:02:12,507 --> 00:02:14,175
And don't skip your meals.

22
00:02:35,864 --> 00:02:38,950
JUNYOUNG

23
00:02:48,751 --> 00:02:50,795
Did you see the comments
under the article about you?

24
00:02:51,462 --> 00:02:53,840
Everyone who was raising hell
and calling me a fraud

25
00:02:54,883 --> 00:02:57,010
now has it in for you.

26
00:02:58,803 --> 00:02:59,971
What about you?

27
00:03:01,347 --> 00:03:02,891
Are you doing better?

28
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:05,977
Well, for me…

29
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:08,479
Thanks to someone,
I'm now a tragic athlete

30
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:12,108
and getting a lot of sympathy votes
overnight.

31
00:03:16,487 --> 00:03:17,530
Taeyang.

32
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:21,576
Things will get tough
for you in this field.

33
00:03:23,244 --> 00:03:24,495
From time to time,

34
00:03:28,082 --> 00:03:32,212
when I think of you,
all I can remember are the good times.

35
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:34,797
That's why

36
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:41,221
I keep mistakenly thinking
that we're friends.

37
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:48,478
Let's not get it confused.

38
00:03:51,856 --> 00:03:54,609
It hurts even when we just see each other.

39
00:03:59,197 --> 00:04:00,198
Okay.

40
00:04:01,783 --> 00:04:02,784
So you and I,

41
00:04:04,285 --> 00:04:05,912
we should put an end to this.

42
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:09,874
I can't say that I forgive you,

43
00:04:11,876 --> 00:04:13,836
but I'll just forget about it.

44
00:04:15,505 --> 00:04:17,674
I'll forget everything related to you

45
00:04:18,716 --> 00:04:20,426
as if we never knew each other.

46
00:04:24,305 --> 00:04:25,890
So you should forget about me too.

47
00:04:26,891 --> 00:04:29,936
And stop feeling sorry for me.
I'm tired of that too.

48
00:04:32,438 --> 00:04:34,065
Actually, I…

49
00:04:37,443 --> 00:04:39,237
-You know--
-We should just

50
00:04:39,821 --> 00:04:42,365
never get involved in each other's lives
from now on. Okay?

51
00:04:43,658 --> 00:04:44,826
That's the easiest way.

52
00:04:46,077 --> 00:04:47,328
That…

53
00:04:49,414 --> 00:04:50,707
isn't going to be easy.

54
00:04:53,668 --> 00:04:54,794
For me…

55
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:01,009
that's the hardest thing to do.

56
00:05:08,474 --> 00:05:09,851
What should I do?

57
00:05:35,752 --> 00:05:37,420
Gosh. Who is it?

58
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:40,298
-Who is--
-Hello.

59
00:05:40,381 --> 00:05:42,091
I'm here with Big Sports.

60
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:43,718
Is Ms. Park Taeyang inside?

61
00:05:44,218 --> 00:05:46,137
I'm here to cover a story
about Ms. Park Junyoung.

62
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:48,222
-Taeyang isn't he--
-Pardon?

63
00:05:48,306 --> 00:05:50,058
-This isn't Taeyang's home.
-What?

64
00:05:50,141 --> 00:05:51,684
Who is Park Taeyang, for God's sake?

65
00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:54,687
-What? Sir!
-Can I ask you a few questions?

66
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:56,773
-Sir!
-Please open the door.

67
00:05:56,856 --> 00:05:59,150
-Are you inside, Ms. Park?
-I only have a few questions.

68
00:05:59,233 --> 00:06:01,903
-Is she really not inside?
-Sorry for disturbing you, sir.

69
00:06:01,986 --> 00:06:04,280
I'LL BE BACK

70
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:08,576
Well, you should've continued
to enjoy your break.

71
00:06:08,659 --> 00:06:09,702
What brings you here?

72
00:06:11,412 --> 00:06:13,998
Nothing matters to you.
Not the team, mentors, coaches…

73
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:16,793
Or your elders.

74
00:06:18,961 --> 00:06:20,046
Coach.

75
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:22,048
Please…

76
00:06:22,924 --> 00:06:24,008
cut me from the team.

77
00:06:26,844 --> 00:06:27,678
What?

78
00:06:27,762 --> 00:06:31,349
To be honest,
who would want me on their team?

79
00:06:32,433 --> 00:06:33,476
I…

80
00:06:34,477 --> 00:06:36,354
don't want to be a burden on the team.

81
00:06:37,438 --> 00:06:38,773
Are you saying that

82
00:06:40,358 --> 00:06:42,568
you've been ghosting us
on purpose all along?

83
00:06:43,528 --> 00:06:45,530
I've been AWOL long enough

84
00:06:45,613 --> 00:06:47,323
to justify getting fired from the team.

85
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:51,536
Please stop bending over backwards for me,

86
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:53,871
and just kick me out.

87
00:07:00,128 --> 00:07:03,131
Goodness. You're such an insolent brat.

88
00:07:04,715 --> 00:07:07,552
Why do you think you get to decide
whether I fire you or not?

89
00:07:08,386 --> 00:07:10,638
Do you want to know the reality?

90
00:07:10,721 --> 00:07:13,391
The company has been pressuring me
to fire you since last night,

91
00:07:13,516 --> 00:07:14,767
but I haven't decided yet.

92
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:18,312
I brought on an athlete who took off
for three years and is finally picking up,

93
00:07:18,396 --> 00:07:21,357
and I'm thinking whether it'd be better
to let you go or to keep you around.

94
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:22,900
You!

95
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:28,322
I get to keep you if I need you
and let you go if I don't. Got it?

96
00:07:28,406 --> 00:07:31,075
You don't get any say in it.

97
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:34,245
All that coddling has
turned you into such a brat!

98
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:40,334
Until there's a final decision,
you'd better go and train hard. Okay?

99
00:08:15,244 --> 00:08:16,537
You came back.

100
00:08:19,624 --> 00:08:20,583
Welcome back.

101
00:08:36,432 --> 00:08:37,892
Our daughter.

102
00:08:38,893 --> 00:08:41,979
She never went on a single field trip
when she was in school,

103
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:44,440
and she missed out on the joys

104
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:47,193
of eating with her friends
during lunchtime.

105
00:08:47,276 --> 00:08:49,529
She never once had a proper chance

106
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:54,200
to go to an amusement park or on a trip,
because she had to train.

107
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:56,661
All she did was train.

108
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:59,622
Yet you want to compensate us with money?

109
00:09:01,582 --> 00:09:03,834
How much do you think we should get?

110
00:09:04,585 --> 00:09:06,712
I'm not saying money will cut it.

111
00:09:08,256 --> 00:09:09,799
I know it's long overdue,

112
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,552
but it seemed like

113
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:15,429
the least I could do as a human being.

114
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:17,974
-After all this time…
-How much will you give us?

115
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:19,350
Enough to buy a house?

116
00:09:19,433 --> 00:09:22,603
Or are you going to give us
a grand building?

117
00:09:23,187 --> 00:09:26,274
If you really wanted to apologize,
the person who did this should be here.

118
00:09:27,149 --> 00:09:31,028
What is it? You can't stand to see
your precious girl bow down to us?

119
00:09:31,862 --> 00:09:33,656
After what she's done to our daughter?

120
00:09:34,365 --> 00:09:38,744
Next time, I'll make sure
to have my daughter apologize properly.

121
00:09:39,328 --> 00:09:40,371
I'm very sorry.

122
00:09:41,998 --> 00:09:43,457
We…

123
00:09:46,127 --> 00:09:48,045
won't forgive her.

124
00:09:58,055 --> 00:10:03,144
From Taejun's standpoint,
she's still his sister's nemesis, right?

125
00:10:03,477 --> 00:10:06,063
But everything seemed fine
between him and Taeyang.

126
00:10:06,147 --> 00:10:08,858
I find that even weirder.
How can he be like that?

127
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:10,318
Is it…

128
00:10:11,068 --> 00:10:11,902
love?

129
00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:15,740
Nemesis or love or whatever it maybe,
just drink up.

130
00:10:15,823 --> 00:10:18,451
Putting Taejun aside,

131
00:10:18,534 --> 00:10:21,078
Junghwan has a bad relationship
with Taeyang too.

132
00:10:21,162 --> 00:10:23,873
He used to go out with Junyoung.

133
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:27,918
We've come too far to turn a blind eye
to what's happening within our team.

134
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:31,964
We have to keep her.

135
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:36,135
If we don't, then who else will?

136
00:10:36,719 --> 00:10:37,970
Goodness.

137
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:42,475
In my heart, I want to keep her.
Of course, I do.

138
00:10:42,558 --> 00:10:45,519
But the General Affairs Department
and HR are all flipping out

139
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:47,563
and telling us to fire Taeyang
from our team.

140
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:50,107
This isn't an easy issue to handle.

141
00:10:50,691 --> 00:10:53,235
-Darn it.
-She's going through a rough patch.

142
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:58,115
That's why we must keep her on our team.

143
00:10:58,616 --> 00:11:01,911
-Why you little--
-I said I'd help. Remember?

144
00:11:02,745 --> 00:11:06,040
I'm not drinking!
I'm never going to drink this!

145
00:11:06,123 --> 00:11:09,001
-You've grown up!
-Why you Sibong…

146
00:11:09,085 --> 00:11:10,628
I was going to pour you a glass--

147
00:11:10,753 --> 00:11:12,755
-Hey, watch it.
-Yes?

148
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:15,091
There's nothing left.

149
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:17,510
You guys drank up the whole bottle.

150
00:11:18,719 --> 00:11:19,929
I'm the only one who's sober.

151
00:11:33,567 --> 00:11:36,237
Jeez, Taeyang. You're training all alone.

152
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:38,489
That's just playing dirty.

153
00:11:38,989 --> 00:11:41,200
We're not going to sit by
and watch you do that.

154
00:11:41,283 --> 00:11:42,827
Get over here.

155
00:11:45,996 --> 00:11:48,416
Taeyang, you have to eat
as much as you've trained without us.

156
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:50,376
What is it?

157
00:11:52,253 --> 00:11:55,297
Gosh, it's so pretty.

158
00:11:57,174 --> 00:11:58,718
These all look good.

159
00:11:58,801 --> 00:12:00,219
How come everything looks so cute?

160
00:12:08,811 --> 00:12:10,062
Taeyang.

161
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:16,026
Sorry for believing the bribery rumors.

162
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:20,406
Come on. What I did was even worse.

163
00:12:20,489 --> 00:12:21,741
I'm sorry about that too.

164
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:26,620
I'm your senior, but I wasn't there
for you three years ago.

165
00:12:28,664 --> 00:12:30,583
I let you run away on your own.

166
00:12:37,673 --> 00:12:39,133
I'm more sorry.

167
00:12:39,633 --> 00:12:41,635
Gosh, you crybaby.

168
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:47,099
Anyway, let me go get some drinks.
I get to pick.

169
00:12:47,224 --> 00:12:49,810
What? No, I can go.

170
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:51,145
It's fine.

171
00:12:51,228 --> 00:12:52,897
Youngsim, then I want a soda.

172
00:13:11,957 --> 00:13:14,960
Taeyang is training by herself.
You should have this with her.

173
00:13:16,212 --> 00:13:17,671
Why? You can give it to her yourself.

174
00:13:17,755 --> 00:13:20,174
It would be nice for the girls
to get together for a change.

175
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:21,509
But…

176
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:24,470
Oh, right. Don't tell her it's from me.

177
00:13:25,763 --> 00:13:28,307
-Why not?
-It's a little embarrassing.

178
00:13:44,406 --> 00:13:46,283
Are you okay with being let go?

179
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:48,828
Can't you see that I'm a mess?

180
00:13:50,579 --> 00:13:51,872
How about you?

181
00:13:52,998 --> 00:13:55,042
Are things okay with Taeyang?

182
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:58,170
She knows now

183
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:00,840
that I'm Junyoung's brother.

184
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:05,636
Well, everything will work out.

185
00:14:05,803 --> 00:14:07,805
Taeyang is training hard.

186
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:10,641
You don't know anything.

187
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:13,394
About what?

188
00:14:17,815 --> 00:14:20,818
Junghwan, at least you should behave.

189
00:14:20,901 --> 00:14:24,822
Taeyang keeps asking
to be taken off the team.

190
00:14:25,197 --> 00:14:27,783
You punk, Coach is having
a really hard time.

191
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:31,120
What is it that I don't know?

192
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:34,206
You know nothing.
Is there anything that you know?

193
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:35,499
Darn you.

194
00:14:43,757 --> 00:14:46,760
PHYSICAL THERAPY CENTER

195
00:14:52,933 --> 00:14:54,059
How are you feeling?

196
00:14:54,268 --> 00:14:55,769
I'm okay.

197
00:14:58,689 --> 00:15:00,816
-Doctor.
-Yes?

198
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:06,113
How is Yook Junghwan doing these days?

199
00:15:07,323 --> 00:15:09,617
Is he having a breakdown
after being cut from the team?

200
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:12,077
I don't know.
He hasn't been here recently.

201
00:15:12,786 --> 00:15:15,414
I knew he'd get into trouble someday.

202
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:19,585
Do you know
how much effort the athletes put in

203
00:15:19,668 --> 00:15:23,213
to keep their spot on the national team?

204
00:15:23,797 --> 00:15:26,467
Well, I have a hunch.

205
00:15:27,676 --> 00:15:29,428
I don't even have that.

206
00:15:29,511 --> 00:15:31,680
I have no idea how hard

207
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:35,351
you have to try
to be in that kind of position.

208
00:15:38,395 --> 00:15:40,814
He lost that spot just like that.

209
00:15:42,149 --> 00:15:45,110
How could you say something like,
"I knew you'd get into trouble"?

210
00:15:47,488 --> 00:15:49,073
It was a little harsh, wasn't it?

211
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:53,619
All he ever did wrong was
fall head over heels for his first love.

212
00:15:53,702 --> 00:15:54,787
First love?

213
00:15:58,415 --> 00:15:59,833
Do you have that person's number?

214
00:16:00,751 --> 00:16:02,002
Who is it?

215
00:16:02,086 --> 00:16:04,755
HISTORY OF PHYSICAL EDUCATION IN KOREA
PSYCHOLOGY IN SPORTS COACHING

216
00:16:14,014 --> 00:16:14,890
Yes?

217
00:16:16,141 --> 00:16:18,727
Hi, I'm Lee Yumin from Somang Bank.

218
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:20,270
We saw a movie together the other day.

219
00:16:22,189 --> 00:16:24,400
What? How did you get my number?

220
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:28,445
I'm not a stalker, so don't be surprised.
I just have something to tell you.

221
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:31,949
What is it? You want to watch
another movie? I don't want to anymore.

222
00:16:32,866 --> 00:16:34,326
Did you know Junghwan was expelled?

223
00:16:37,538 --> 00:16:39,790
The news is everywhere,
so I'm sure you do.

224
00:16:39,873 --> 00:16:41,125
Do you know why?

225
00:16:41,709 --> 00:16:43,627
Why do I have to talk with you about this?

226
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:46,296
That video of you and Junghwan.
He found the guy who taped it

227
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:49,299
and beat the hell out of him.
That's why he got cut. Everybody knows.

228
00:16:49,383 --> 00:16:52,553
Junghwan being in trouble
because of a girl is the talk of the town.

229
00:16:52,636 --> 00:16:53,804
Did you know about it or not?

230
00:16:57,391 --> 00:16:58,559
I guess you didn't.

231
00:16:59,727 --> 00:17:01,145
You should be in the know.

232
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:03,564
Why are you telling me this?

233
00:17:03,647 --> 00:17:05,232
Why don't you know anything?

234
00:17:05,315 --> 00:17:07,401
Who's at fault for him letting go
of the Korean flag?

235
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:09,737
I'm hanging up!

236
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:24,251
Let's meet tonight.

237
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:26,462
I'm on my way to Seoul.

238
00:17:42,394 --> 00:17:44,897
Get in. Where do you want to go?

239
00:17:48,984 --> 00:17:49,985
Why did you do it?

240
00:17:52,029 --> 00:17:53,781
I heard you got into that fight
because of me.

241
00:17:55,699 --> 00:17:56,867
Who said that?

242
00:17:57,951 --> 00:17:58,994
Lee Yumin.

243
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:03,248
You two know each other?

244
00:18:03,332 --> 00:18:05,375
When are you going
to stop throwing tantrums?

245
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:09,505
Don't you know how hard it'll be
to get back on the team after this?

246
00:18:10,297 --> 00:18:12,424
Even if you do get back
on the national team,

247
00:18:12,508 --> 00:18:14,676
you'll still be blacklisted.
What are you going to do?

248
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:16,929
Do you even think about these things?

249
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:20,057
I just don't understand.

250
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:22,059
You broke up with me.

251
00:18:22,142 --> 00:18:25,354
So why can't you put an end to us?
Why are you still lost?

252
00:18:26,021 --> 00:18:28,148
-You could've been rational--
-Stop.

253
00:18:37,908 --> 00:18:40,410
Am I only an athlete to you till the end?

254
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:45,707
I know you're completely over me,

255
00:18:45,874 --> 00:18:48,794
and it's obvious I mean nothing to you.

256
00:18:48,877 --> 00:18:51,380
But I couldn't stand
Yideun talking badly about you.

257
00:18:51,463 --> 00:18:52,923
Why did I do that?

258
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:56,844
I guess I really loved you.

259
00:18:58,220 --> 00:18:59,346
I…

260
00:19:01,682 --> 00:19:03,100
Look at the situation I'm in.

261
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:06,478
I can't even answer calls
from my family these days.

262
00:19:07,521 --> 00:19:09,148
Did anyone ask you to get in trouble?

263
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:14,653
Is that really all you have to say to me?

264
00:19:16,738 --> 00:19:19,491
"Are you okay? It must be hard."

265
00:19:19,575 --> 00:19:21,201
Is this that difficult to say?

266
00:19:21,285 --> 00:19:23,996
Not as an athlete,
but as a friend at the very least.

267
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:30,335
I wanted to be comforted by you.

268
00:19:33,922 --> 00:19:35,757
Did I go out with you as an athlete?

269
00:19:38,594 --> 00:19:39,970
No, you were a woman to me.

270
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:46,602
When you lost badminton,

271
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:49,605
I bet you thought you were going through
a harder time than anyone else.

272
00:19:50,314 --> 00:19:51,398
But I…

273
00:19:58,322 --> 00:20:00,324
It was really hard for me
because I lost you.

274
00:20:03,243 --> 00:20:04,369
But

275
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:07,414
I'll admit it now.

276
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:11,543
My first love…

277
00:20:15,339 --> 00:20:16,965
was completely pathetic.

278
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:21,428
I admit it.

279
00:20:42,491 --> 00:20:45,077
What kind of sister was Junyoung?

280
00:20:49,873 --> 00:20:52,292
Just asking out of curiosity.

281
00:20:54,378 --> 00:20:55,963
She was full of herself.

282
00:20:56,797 --> 00:21:00,217
"Junyoung's brother?
He can't play as well as his sister."

283
00:21:01,593 --> 00:21:05,347
I think I've heard that
more than 10,000 times.

284
00:21:08,183 --> 00:21:11,311
"Why is Junyoung's brother like that?"
This one,

285
00:21:12,604 --> 00:21:13,647
I heard like 5,000 times.

286
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:16,608
Even in competitions,

287
00:21:17,234 --> 00:21:18,986
"That's Junyoung's brother."

288
00:21:20,487 --> 00:21:22,197
I would hear people talk.

289
00:21:22,698 --> 00:21:23,782
Then

290
00:21:25,367 --> 00:21:26,618
I'd break out in a cold sweat.

291
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:32,708
-I'll do it.
-It's okay.

292
00:21:35,752 --> 00:21:37,045
So

293
00:21:38,588 --> 00:21:40,048
I was scared of playing badminton,

294
00:21:41,258 --> 00:21:42,968
of the fact that I wasn't good at it.

295
00:21:47,764 --> 00:21:49,016
But

296
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:53,687
I didn't want other people to find out
that I was scared.

297
00:21:54,813 --> 00:21:56,398
So what did I do?

298
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:00,068
I laughed it off.

299
00:22:01,945 --> 00:22:04,072
I pretended as if nothing interested me.

300
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:09,703
But then you told me something.

301
00:22:12,497 --> 00:22:16,043
Try appreciating your talent
half as much as you appreciate mine.

302
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:18,587
You would've been huge by now if you had.

303
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:20,047
What?

304
00:22:20,881 --> 00:22:23,050
Like a pretty good player
on a company team?

305
00:22:24,051 --> 00:22:25,093
No.

306
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:29,431
The best.

307
00:22:33,685 --> 00:22:37,064
So there's no way I'm letting you go.

308
00:22:39,608 --> 00:22:41,610
It wasn't about wanting
to become the best.

309
00:22:43,153 --> 00:22:45,280
"You can be the best."

310
00:22:47,532 --> 00:22:49,326
I think I needed at least one person

311
00:22:50,702 --> 00:22:52,704
in my life to tell me something like that.

312
00:22:54,247 --> 00:22:55,415
The thing is,

313
00:22:57,417 --> 00:23:00,962
I'm not sure
if this can bring you any comfort,

314
00:23:03,006 --> 00:23:07,260
but Junyoung found it hard
to live her life as the best.

315
00:23:18,563 --> 00:23:19,898
I don't think

316
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:23,610
anyone lives their life
without getting hurt.

317
00:23:29,282 --> 00:23:32,202
Like how you can't be an athlete
without getting injured.

318
00:23:37,999 --> 00:23:40,669
"I got hurt just like everyone else."

319
00:23:42,003 --> 00:23:43,755
If that's how you think,

320
00:23:46,591 --> 00:23:48,343
it doesn't have to be such a big deal.

321
00:24:04,359 --> 00:24:06,069
It might not be such a big deal.

322
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:08,488
Even our breakup

323
00:24:09,531 --> 00:24:11,241
might not be such a big deal.

324
00:24:24,296 --> 00:24:27,424
Look, new items.

325
00:24:29,009 --> 00:24:32,012
The color of the grip looks amazing.

326
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:35,432
Yuri, do you want mine too?

327
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:37,601
Really?

328
00:24:44,232 --> 00:24:46,318
Sungsil, we wear
the same size shoe, right?

329
00:24:46,902 --> 00:24:48,236
Here you go.

330
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:51,239
Do you want the racket too?

331
00:24:51,323 --> 00:24:53,074
But what about you?

332
00:24:54,284 --> 00:24:57,412
Well, I don't need this much stuff.

333
00:25:02,959 --> 00:25:04,211
-Sunsoo.
-Yes?

334
00:25:04,294 --> 00:25:06,463
-Do you want socks?
-Yes.

335
00:25:07,756 --> 00:25:08,590
Hey.

336
00:25:09,591 --> 00:25:10,717
Let's talk.

337
00:25:17,265 --> 00:25:19,392
-Here.
-Thank you.

338
00:25:25,899 --> 00:25:28,860
Seriously, you're so mean.

339
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:33,823
I have a question.

340
00:25:34,533 --> 00:25:35,367
What is it?

341
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:37,827
Are you going to leave Yunis?

342
00:25:39,454 --> 00:25:41,331
I'm sure I'll get fired.

343
00:25:41,957 --> 00:25:45,043
I hope it happens soon
before I get more attached.

344
00:25:47,128 --> 00:25:48,630
Is this what you came back for?

345
00:25:49,756 --> 00:25:52,634
I know. I shouldn't have returned.

346
00:25:54,761 --> 00:25:57,389
When you told me to let go of the racket,

347
00:25:58,181 --> 00:26:00,183
I should've ended it all then.

348
00:26:05,855 --> 00:26:07,440
What are you talking about?

349
00:26:07,524 --> 00:26:09,109
Were you going to leave the team?

350
00:26:11,945 --> 00:26:14,573
Even begging to be kept on the team
wouldn't have been enough,

351
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:16,157
yet she asked the coach to fire her.

352
00:26:18,493 --> 00:26:20,078
Do you regret coming back?

353
00:26:20,161 --> 00:26:21,871
Then don't turn this into a regret.

354
00:26:22,455 --> 00:26:24,457
You're really looking out for me.

355
00:26:24,541 --> 00:26:26,167
I can't stand the sight of you.

356
00:26:27,794 --> 00:26:29,629
Junyoung's become
a totally different person.

357
00:26:30,005 --> 00:26:31,464
I got kicked off the national team.

358
00:26:31,548 --> 00:26:33,258
And you're running away again.

359
00:26:34,634 --> 00:26:35,885
What is all this?

360
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:56,406
I don't have a good reason
to stay on the team, Taejun.

361
00:26:56,489 --> 00:26:58,074
Don't say another word.

362
00:26:58,867 --> 00:27:01,286
You weren't planning on telling me anyway.

363
00:27:10,253 --> 00:27:14,758
That's why I'm asking you
to help take care of the situation.

364
00:27:15,383 --> 00:27:18,511
Gosh. I also want to stand up
for our athletes.

365
00:27:19,137 --> 00:27:20,764
But keeping Taeyang could mean

366
00:27:20,847 --> 00:27:23,683
losing our other members.

367
00:27:23,767 --> 00:27:26,227
What are you talking about?

368
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:30,023
The coach of the national team
reached out to me.

369
00:27:31,149 --> 00:27:33,360
Kwon Kichul? Why did that bas--

370
00:27:35,153 --> 00:27:36,279
Why did he do that?

371
00:27:36,363 --> 00:27:38,698
He said if we don't fire Taeyang,

372
00:27:38,907 --> 00:27:40,950
he'll put all Yunis athletes
at a disadvantage.

373
00:27:41,034 --> 00:27:42,452
God, that son of a…

374
00:27:44,579 --> 00:27:46,873
Darn it, that scumbag.

375
00:27:46,956 --> 00:27:49,417
Because of what Taeyang did,

376
00:27:49,793 --> 00:27:51,586
he was humiliated.

377
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:54,881
All this time, he was played for a fool,
and he believed the kids' lies,

378
00:27:54,964 --> 00:27:57,509
so he's holding a grudge, for sure.

379
00:27:57,967 --> 00:27:59,010
Is that…

380
00:27:59,469 --> 00:28:01,680
Is that the reason
you want me to fire Taeyang?

381
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:02,972
Due to external pressure?

382
00:28:03,056 --> 00:28:06,685
Then Coach, haven't you considered
the futures of the other players?

383
00:28:07,435 --> 00:28:10,146
-Coach.
-Hey, I'm in the middle of a meeting--

384
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:11,815
It's okay. I'm done here.

385
00:28:11,898 --> 00:28:15,819
Coach, let's make
a practical decision this time.

386
00:28:16,236 --> 00:28:19,447
We'll be waiting to hear back
from you. Okay?

387
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:33,962
All right. Why are you here?

388
00:28:34,838 --> 00:28:35,839
Taeyang.

389
00:28:37,132 --> 00:28:38,299
What will happen to her?

390
00:28:41,261 --> 00:28:42,637
Let's talk about this later.

391
00:28:43,054 --> 00:28:44,139
Coach.

392
00:28:46,474 --> 00:28:48,059
Please help her out this once.

393
00:28:48,685 --> 00:28:50,478
If she leaves our team now,

394
00:28:50,979 --> 00:28:52,772
you know no other team will take her in.

395
00:28:52,856 --> 00:28:55,900
If this is about asking me for a favor,
tell Taeyang to come talk to me herself.

396
00:28:55,984 --> 00:28:57,569
She's weak and lost.

397
00:28:58,361 --> 00:28:59,612
Why can't you just let her stay?

398
00:28:59,696 --> 00:29:01,448
She doesn't have the will.

399
00:29:01,531 --> 00:29:03,575
A coach shouldn't do unwanted favors
for an athlete.

400
00:29:03,658 --> 00:29:05,034
That's where the line stands.

401
00:29:05,118 --> 00:29:07,495
It gets hard for both sides
once you cross that line.

402
00:29:09,164 --> 00:29:10,290
You should get going.

403
00:29:10,915 --> 00:29:13,918
All she's done in her life is train
without making room for a Plan B.

404
00:29:14,002 --> 00:29:15,879
She talks about
becoming a national athlete,

405
00:29:15,962 --> 00:29:17,422
but from what I see,

406
00:29:19,883 --> 00:29:21,384
that isn't her dream.

407
00:29:21,968 --> 00:29:25,346
The Olympics? She knows
that it's too late for her now.

408
00:29:25,722 --> 00:29:28,683
She returned three years
after the incident.

409
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:30,769
Despite all the painful memories,

410
00:29:31,102 --> 00:29:33,271
she still came back here on her own.

411
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:38,276
That means she has nowhere else to go.

412
00:29:39,486 --> 00:29:41,654
That she can't live
without playing badminton.

413
00:29:44,032 --> 00:29:45,283
So

414
00:29:48,119 --> 00:29:49,454
please forgive her this once.

415
00:29:50,121 --> 00:29:51,664
Please, Coach.

416
00:30:18,191 --> 00:30:21,152
-One, two, three, four.
-One, two, three, four.

417
00:30:21,653 --> 00:30:23,613
One, two.

418
00:30:24,239 --> 00:30:26,533
Three, four.

419
00:30:27,158 --> 00:30:29,994
-One, two, three, four.
-One, two, three, four.

420
00:30:30,078 --> 00:30:31,246
One.

421
00:30:31,746 --> 00:30:33,081
-I'm starving.
-What do you want?

422
00:30:33,164 --> 00:30:34,666
-What should we eat?
-What do you want?

423
00:30:34,749 --> 00:30:36,835
-I think we need to get some meat.
-All right.

424
00:30:36,918 --> 00:30:38,837
-Okay. Then pork belly?
-Yes. pork belly.

425
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,088
Okay. Sounds good.

426
00:30:40,171 --> 00:30:41,756
-Let's do rock, paper, scissors.
-Here!

427
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,383
-Hurry.
-Where's Youngsim?

428
00:30:43,466 --> 00:30:45,260
I don't know where Youngsim is

429
00:30:45,343 --> 00:30:47,929
She doesn't know.
The loser buys everyone pork belly.

430
00:30:48,012 --> 00:30:50,223
-Rock, paper, scissors!
-Rock, paper, scissors!

431
00:30:50,557 --> 00:30:52,433
-Rock, paper, scissors!
-Rock, paper, scissors!

432
00:30:55,186 --> 00:30:56,437
She looks pretty, right?

433
00:30:56,521 --> 00:30:57,772
Isn't she so pretty?

434
00:30:57,856 --> 00:31:00,441
What's happening?
Youngsim, are you going on a date?

435
00:31:00,525 --> 00:31:02,026
-That's not it.
-What is it then?

436
00:31:02,527 --> 00:31:05,655
-You're so pretty!
-Look at her!

437
00:31:06,364 --> 00:31:08,783
-Youngsim, you look pretty!
-She's so pretty.

438
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:11,578
Goodness.

439
00:31:12,745 --> 00:31:14,080
Hana!

440
00:31:14,414 --> 00:31:15,665
Gosh, Hana!

441
00:31:16,416 --> 00:31:17,625
My daughter.

442
00:31:18,751 --> 00:31:20,044
Let me see your face.

443
00:31:21,921 --> 00:31:24,340
Gosh, you've gotten even prettier.

444
00:31:24,883 --> 00:31:27,093
-Does Mommy look pretty today?
-Jeez.

445
00:31:27,176 --> 00:31:29,137
This is where I get to see
Jung Hyunwoo in person.

446
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:31,139
This is so unreal.
She's with a soccer star.

447
00:31:31,222 --> 00:31:34,058
What? Youngsim isn't so bad
when she's dressed up like that.

448
00:31:34,851 --> 00:31:37,061
Anyway, does she always look
this different with makeup?

449
00:31:37,145 --> 00:31:39,564
-She does.
-Gosh, she's scary.

450
00:31:40,648 --> 00:31:42,942
-Hana, did you miss Mommy too?
-Yes.

451
00:31:49,282 --> 00:31:51,242
-You still play.
-Yes.

452
00:31:51,868 --> 00:31:52,952
You do too.

453
00:31:54,954 --> 00:31:56,372
Can you take her bag to the dorm?

454
00:31:56,456 --> 00:31:58,291
We're going out to eat tonight.

455
00:32:01,294 --> 00:32:02,754
But look at you. I mean…

456
00:32:04,005 --> 00:32:05,840
You're carrying her bag your entire life.

457
00:32:07,884 --> 00:32:09,844
-Now that's wrong.
-Hush.

458
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:11,012
Calm down.

459
00:32:13,389 --> 00:32:14,766
Maybe we're meant to be.

460
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:16,768
Okay.

461
00:32:18,269 --> 00:32:20,939
Let's go.

462
00:33:18,287 --> 00:33:19,706
Lie back down.

463
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:33,052
Just get some sleep. Get some rest.

464
00:33:55,658 --> 00:33:56,951
I'll leave.

465
00:33:57,869 --> 00:33:59,537
You want to leave so you can avoid me.

466
00:34:08,504 --> 00:34:09,589
We…

467
00:34:11,632 --> 00:34:12,842
should end this.

468
00:34:17,722 --> 00:34:19,015
Don't say something like that

469
00:34:20,641 --> 00:34:21,559
so lightly.

470
00:34:22,685 --> 00:34:26,522
Do you know why I liked you?

471
00:34:29,233 --> 00:34:30,443
Because you're nice.

472
00:34:32,779 --> 00:34:34,906
Continue to be nice.

473
00:34:35,573 --> 00:34:36,866
Be you.

474
00:34:37,950 --> 00:34:40,995
Don't ruin yourself because of me.

475
00:34:46,125 --> 00:34:48,002
Do you think you're doing this for me?

476
00:34:49,378 --> 00:34:50,630
Then open your eyes.

477
00:34:51,881 --> 00:34:53,382
Look me in the eyes and tell me.

478
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:58,179
I can't.

479
00:35:02,558 --> 00:35:03,726
I'll just…

480
00:35:09,398 --> 00:35:10,900
I'll think of you

481
00:35:12,068 --> 00:35:14,529
as a dream that was in my life.

482
00:35:15,905 --> 00:35:18,741
The reality will hit me
once I open my eyes.

483
00:35:18,825 --> 00:35:20,409
Why am I a dream?

484
00:35:21,494 --> 00:35:23,371
Stop running away and face it.

485
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:26,916
We haven't even tried yet.

486
00:35:26,999 --> 00:35:28,626
We haven't even gotten started.

487
00:35:30,545 --> 00:35:33,631
I can persuade my family.

488
00:35:37,677 --> 00:35:38,678
Taeyang.

489
00:35:43,266 --> 00:35:44,684
You love me.

490
00:35:57,655 --> 00:35:58,948
But…

491
00:36:00,241 --> 00:36:01,367
I used to

492
00:36:02,952 --> 00:36:06,330
really like Junyoung

493
00:36:07,790 --> 00:36:09,125
a lot.

494
00:36:10,626 --> 00:36:12,420
As much as you mean to me,

495
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:15,506
she also

496
00:36:17,508 --> 00:36:18,509
meant a lot

497
00:36:20,511 --> 00:36:22,930
to me too.

498
00:36:25,766 --> 00:36:26,976
So

499
00:36:30,605 --> 00:36:33,149
I can't do this anymore.

500
00:36:40,615 --> 00:36:41,782
We shouldn't think

501
00:36:43,868 --> 00:36:46,871
that it's only our love that matters.

502
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:54,295
We liked each other a lot,

503
00:36:55,171 --> 00:36:56,714
so for me,

504
00:36:59,342 --> 00:37:00,843
that will be enough.

505
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:15,024
I want you

506
00:37:16,776 --> 00:37:18,903
to be happy.

507
00:37:25,701 --> 00:37:27,036
I'll think about it.

508
00:38:12,832 --> 00:38:15,001
Let's grab a bite
before heading back. I'm starving.

509
00:38:18,254 --> 00:38:19,964
I don't think I can.

510
00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:37,523
Why did you tell Junyoung about me?

511
00:38:39,108 --> 00:38:40,401
I was worried about you.

512
00:38:44,238 --> 00:38:45,323
What?

513
00:38:46,157 --> 00:38:48,200
I don't even get to worry about you?

514
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:55,291
Obviously I wasn't going to be
of any comfort to you, so--

515
00:38:55,416 --> 00:38:57,418
Junyoung didn't comfort me either.

516
00:39:00,796 --> 00:39:02,465
Don't waste your energy next time.

517
00:39:07,553 --> 00:39:08,679
So,

518
00:39:10,181 --> 00:39:12,391
did you get all dramatic
after telling her about it?

519
00:39:12,475 --> 00:39:13,392
No.

520
00:39:14,101 --> 00:39:16,103
I got annoyed, so I went on a blind date.

521
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:19,231
I drank shots,
which I hadn't done in a while.

522
00:39:19,982 --> 00:39:21,233
I see.

523
00:39:22,568 --> 00:39:23,402
Drinking shots.

524
00:39:25,946 --> 00:39:27,198
It must have been fun.

525
00:39:27,281 --> 00:39:28,866
It was hot.

526
00:39:30,576 --> 00:39:31,994
I hate women.

527
00:39:33,871 --> 00:39:35,039
Let's go after we finish this.

528
00:39:46,592 --> 00:39:48,803
I'll see you again in the spring.

529
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:56,227
What?

530
00:39:57,228 --> 00:40:00,940
Until then. you could try
to hold back from going on blind dates

531
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:03,526
if you can.

532
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:12,159
What are you mean by
"see you in the spring"?

533
00:40:15,204 --> 00:40:17,915
When in spring? The first of March?

534
00:40:19,083 --> 00:40:20,543
The first of April?

535
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:22,503
The first day of spring?

536
00:40:22,586 --> 00:40:24,088
Just when it's a little…

537
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:27,466
warmer.

538
00:40:29,552 --> 00:40:31,262
When all the ice has thawed.

539
00:40:45,985 --> 00:40:48,404
What's taking her so long to come back?

540
00:40:50,823 --> 00:40:52,158
Gosh, it's freezing.

541
00:41:00,875 --> 00:41:02,918
Why do they ask me to take out the trash?

542
00:41:03,210 --> 00:41:05,045
Hey, you're back early.

543
00:41:05,713 --> 00:41:07,089
Get the kids to do that for you.

544
00:41:07,173 --> 00:41:08,507
Nothing special happened today?

545
00:41:10,009 --> 00:41:10,926
No.

546
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:14,388
It must have been nice.
You three haven't gone out in a while.

547
00:41:15,639 --> 00:41:18,392
I was only with Hana.

548
00:41:19,393 --> 00:41:20,436
Really?

549
00:41:26,734 --> 00:41:27,693
Excuse me.

550
00:41:29,445 --> 00:41:34,366
Is this the dorm for Yunis?

551
00:41:34,450 --> 00:41:36,327
Yes. Can I ask why you're--

552
00:41:36,410 --> 00:41:37,495
Wait.

553
00:41:38,704 --> 00:41:41,499
Are you Junyoung's mother, by any chance?

554
00:41:41,999 --> 00:41:43,834
I've met you a few times before.

555
00:41:43,918 --> 00:41:46,504
I see. Hello, ma'am.

556
00:41:46,587 --> 00:41:47,922
-Hello.
-Hello.

557
00:41:50,090 --> 00:41:51,258
The thing is,

558
00:41:52,384 --> 00:41:56,514
I'm here to see Taeyang.

559
00:41:57,097 --> 00:42:01,435
I saw a coffee shop
near the intersection down there.

560
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:06,232
Can you let her know that
I'll wait for her there?

561
00:42:11,654 --> 00:42:12,696
Sure.

562
00:42:20,246 --> 00:42:22,414
What took you two hours
to take out the trash?

563
00:42:23,958 --> 00:42:26,126
Did I wait for two hours?

564
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:28,212
Pardon? Wait?

565
00:42:29,004 --> 00:42:31,090
-For whom?
-What?

566
00:42:32,508 --> 00:42:33,425
Nothing.

567
00:42:33,509 --> 00:42:34,843
Come on.

568
00:42:38,973 --> 00:42:40,266
Taejun, do you have a minute?

569
00:42:40,349 --> 00:42:42,643
-Can't it wait till tomorrow?
-It's about Taeyang.

570
00:42:43,894 --> 00:42:46,939
Junyoung's mom is here
looking for Taeyang.

571
00:42:48,065 --> 00:42:49,358
It got me worried.

572
00:42:54,655 --> 00:42:57,032
The person you have reached
is not available.

573
00:42:57,116 --> 00:42:58,325
Why isn't she picking up?

574
00:43:04,290 --> 00:43:05,416
Taeyang.

575
00:43:08,586 --> 00:43:09,837
Why did you turn off your cell?

576
00:43:11,422 --> 00:43:12,590
No, just keep it that way.

577
00:43:13,549 --> 00:43:14,675
What is it?

578
00:43:15,175 --> 00:43:16,677
My mom is here looking for you.

579
00:43:18,429 --> 00:43:20,598
You should get back to the dorm.
I'll talk to her.

580
00:43:22,057 --> 00:43:25,436
It's my business.
I should've met with her a long time ago.

581
00:43:25,936 --> 00:43:29,064
Nothing good can come of it.
You can do it later.

582
00:43:29,148 --> 00:43:31,150
-Where is she?
-Listen to me.

583
00:43:33,235 --> 00:43:36,113
Do you think you're all that?
How much do you think you can handle?

584
00:43:37,072 --> 00:43:39,366
I don't want you adding on
to what you're going through.

585
00:43:40,034 --> 00:43:42,578
I don't want to see you
saying "I'm sorry" and apologizing.

586
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:45,956
Even if it's to my sister and my mom,

587
00:43:48,208 --> 00:43:49,376
I hate seeing you beg.

588
00:43:51,003 --> 00:43:52,379
It was an accident.

589
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:54,715
What did you do that was so wrong?

590
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:02,348
Get back to the dorm.

591
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:05,225
I can talk to my mom.

592
00:44:47,976 --> 00:44:49,144
Mom.

593
00:44:57,945 --> 00:44:59,196
Let's go home.

594
00:45:28,434 --> 00:45:30,018
Say something.

595
00:45:31,895 --> 00:45:33,313
Just drive.

596
00:45:33,772 --> 00:45:34,606
Mom.

597
00:45:35,774 --> 00:45:37,985
I said, just drive.

598
00:45:57,212 --> 00:45:58,338
Taejun.

599
00:46:00,340 --> 00:46:01,258
Yes?

600
00:46:02,968 --> 00:46:04,553
I'm begging you.

601
00:46:05,512 --> 00:46:06,722
Please, I'm begging you.

602
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:10,267
What are you doing?

603
00:46:11,477 --> 00:46:14,104
Let's get this settled
before Junyoung finds out.

604
00:46:14,438 --> 00:46:18,942
I'm so afraid you two might end up
hurting each other.

605
00:46:20,486 --> 00:46:21,737
Can't you just…

606
00:46:23,489 --> 00:46:25,699
Can't you just be on my side this once?

607
00:46:25,783 --> 00:46:27,493
How could you?

608
00:46:27,826 --> 00:46:29,953
How could you do this to your sister?

609
00:46:34,249 --> 00:46:35,709
What are you doing here?

610
00:46:36,418 --> 00:46:37,419
Why did you come out?

611
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:40,547
I heard the gate open,
but no one was coming in.

612
00:46:41,131 --> 00:46:42,591
Let's go inside. It's getting cold.

613
00:46:43,717 --> 00:46:44,843
Come on.

614
00:46:46,136 --> 00:46:48,806
-Junyoung.
-Let's go inside.

615
00:46:54,394 --> 00:46:55,896
Come with me to the convenience store.

616
00:47:11,411 --> 00:47:12,663
Do you want some beer?

617
00:47:14,790 --> 00:47:16,500
I've started prepping for grad school,

618
00:47:16,583 --> 00:47:18,710
and every night, I want to drink.

619
00:47:21,213 --> 00:47:22,172
Junyoung.

620
00:47:32,432 --> 00:47:33,517
What is it?

621
00:47:34,810 --> 00:47:36,270
I love Taeyang.

622
00:47:39,439 --> 00:47:40,858
Taeyang.

623
00:47:42,526 --> 00:47:43,610
I love her.

624
00:47:51,827 --> 00:47:53,078
I already knew that.

625
00:47:55,455 --> 00:47:57,124
You're finally telling me yourself.

626
00:48:00,502 --> 00:48:02,254
You guys are so ridiculous.

627
00:48:04,715 --> 00:48:08,051
Taeyang didn't tell you that we met?

628
00:48:11,847 --> 00:48:13,348
She didn't break up with you?

629
00:48:14,975 --> 00:48:17,728
She told me that she would.

630
00:48:20,272 --> 00:48:21,231
What?

631
00:48:23,859 --> 00:48:24,943
I…

632
00:48:28,196 --> 00:48:29,615
like Taejun.

633
00:48:33,493 --> 00:48:34,661
Who?

634
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:40,083
I really like him.

635
00:48:45,881 --> 00:48:48,842
Junyoung, I'm so sorry.

636
00:48:51,803 --> 00:48:53,305
My brother?

637
00:49:01,688 --> 00:49:02,981
It's not going to work, right?

638
00:49:04,733 --> 00:49:06,360
I must be out of my mind.

639
00:49:12,866 --> 00:49:14,034
What if…

640
00:49:16,870 --> 00:49:18,413
I beg? That still won't work?

641
00:49:20,916 --> 00:49:22,793
Why are you doing this to me?

642
00:49:28,298 --> 00:49:30,509
PARK TAEJUN

643
00:49:44,272 --> 00:49:45,482
I'll break up with him.

644
00:49:49,903 --> 00:49:51,196
I'll break up with him.

645
00:49:55,784 --> 00:49:57,703
Has she already broken up with you?

646
00:49:58,286 --> 00:49:59,454
Is that why you're doing this?

647
00:50:01,873 --> 00:50:03,625
Did Mom find out about this?

648
00:50:05,210 --> 00:50:08,088
You're stupid.
You shouldn't have gotten caught by Mom.

649
00:50:09,297 --> 00:50:11,800
Mom gets more upset
about my life than I do.

650
00:50:11,883 --> 00:50:13,510
Can't you see how this will hurt her?

651
00:50:13,593 --> 00:50:14,761
What is it?

652
00:50:15,554 --> 00:50:17,973
Are you so crazy about her
that nothing else matters?

653
00:50:20,517 --> 00:50:23,603
Then can I tell you
why you have to break up with her?

654
00:50:25,564 --> 00:50:26,898
Think about Taeyang.

655
00:50:27,566 --> 00:50:29,818
How many times would she have to apologize
because of you?

656
00:50:31,486 --> 00:50:35,323
To me, to our mom and dad.
How many times do you think it'll be?

657
00:50:35,407 --> 00:50:37,659
A hundred times? A thousand times?

658
00:50:39,327 --> 00:50:41,204
Would she get a warm look from us
after that?

659
00:50:41,288 --> 00:50:42,330
Stop.

660
00:50:42,414 --> 00:50:45,083
Do you have any idea
what you're putting her up to?

661
00:50:45,167 --> 00:50:46,126
I said stop.

662
00:50:47,836 --> 00:50:49,713
I'm sorry for what I'm doing to you,

663
00:50:51,465 --> 00:50:52,507
but stop.

664
00:50:57,637 --> 00:50:59,389
Seriously, what even is love?

665
00:51:01,099 --> 00:51:03,143
Why is everyone making
such a big fuss over it?

666
00:51:06,646 --> 00:51:07,898
I really don't get it.

667
00:51:36,635 --> 00:51:37,844
Do you want some?

668
00:52:58,884 --> 00:53:00,927
Damn it. He's a bastard.

669
00:53:03,096 --> 00:53:05,849
I knew this scumbag would do
something like this.

670
00:53:05,932 --> 00:53:07,976
Is it true that
if we keep Taeyang on our team,

671
00:53:08,476 --> 00:53:10,729
the national team will put our kids
at a disadvantage?

672
00:53:10,812 --> 00:53:12,564
Is that even possible these days?

673
00:53:13,315 --> 00:53:15,317
It shouldn't.

674
00:53:18,236 --> 00:53:20,363
But Coach Kwon can make it happen.

675
00:53:21,114 --> 00:53:23,074
They should just fire him
from the national team.

676
00:53:23,158 --> 00:53:24,993
He's such a jerk.

677
00:53:26,953 --> 00:53:28,872
Do I have to put up with this?

678
00:53:29,456 --> 00:53:33,168
Do I have to lower myself
this much to be a coach?

679
00:53:34,044 --> 00:53:35,795
Then what are you going to do?

680
00:53:35,879 --> 00:53:36,880
What?

681
00:53:42,427 --> 00:53:43,637
I can't put up with this.

682
00:53:45,430 --> 00:53:46,514
Coach.

683
00:53:47,182 --> 00:53:49,601
Coach, where are we going?

684
00:53:50,352 --> 00:53:51,937
Be honest with me.

685
00:53:54,022 --> 00:53:55,899
Did something happen
between you and Coach Kwon?

686
00:53:56,816 --> 00:53:58,443
You know what? Forget it.

687
00:53:58,944 --> 00:54:01,238
We can talk more about it
on our way in the car.

688
00:54:02,072 --> 00:54:03,198
Taeyang.

689
00:54:04,157 --> 00:54:05,909
Who's your coach?

690
00:54:05,992 --> 00:54:07,702
Is it Kwon Kichul or me?

691
00:54:09,579 --> 00:54:11,581
-You are.
-Then, you punk!

692
00:54:14,793 --> 00:54:16,503
Why are you listening to him?

693
00:54:17,254 --> 00:54:19,172
I'm your coach!

694
00:54:30,433 --> 00:54:31,476
Taesang.

695
00:54:33,186 --> 00:54:35,522
You should take better care
of your athletes.

696
00:54:37,357 --> 00:54:40,068
I don't have much time.
Say what it is you have to say.

697
00:54:40,694 --> 00:54:41,861
I'm…

698
00:54:44,072 --> 00:54:46,449
-I'm…
-Yes?

699
00:54:48,618 --> 00:54:50,745
I'm sorry about not taking better care
of my athletes.

700
00:54:52,289 --> 00:54:55,292
I'll make sure
to look after them properly from now--

701
00:54:55,375 --> 00:54:56,501
Seriously.

702
00:54:57,294 --> 00:54:59,212
I don't know why you're doing this to me.

703
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:05,260
Cut me some slack.

704
00:55:06,845 --> 00:55:09,597
Please, I'm asking you for a favor.

705
00:55:11,099 --> 00:55:13,018
I'm really sorry.

706
00:55:13,685 --> 00:55:15,729
-Coach--
-You little punk!

707
00:55:15,895 --> 00:55:17,063
Go on and beg for forgiveness!

708
00:55:22,235 --> 00:55:26,156
This punk is too sorry to even say a word.

709
00:55:26,948 --> 00:55:29,784
I'll make sure to pay closer attention
to this one going forward--

710
00:55:29,868 --> 00:55:30,744
I

711
00:55:32,954 --> 00:55:34,497
was wrong.

712
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,418
I'm sorry.

713
00:55:52,265 --> 00:55:55,143
All right. You're my senior
asking me for a favor,

714
00:55:55,977 --> 00:55:58,063
so I'll let it slide this time.

715
00:56:03,526 --> 00:56:04,986
Are you ashamed of me too?

716
00:56:08,615 --> 00:56:09,574
No, sir.

717
00:56:10,450 --> 00:56:11,534
Never.

718
00:56:12,619 --> 00:56:14,788
Even so, it's better than
not having a coach.

719
00:56:16,122 --> 00:56:18,166
I'm your coach, you punk.

720
00:56:20,585 --> 00:56:22,379
Yes, Coach.

721
00:56:23,171 --> 00:56:24,339
You'll do your best, right?

722
00:56:26,758 --> 00:56:27,801
Yes, sir.

723
00:56:27,884 --> 00:56:29,761
You will still be penalized by the team.

724
00:56:29,844 --> 00:56:31,304
I can't help you with that.

725
00:56:31,388 --> 00:56:35,517
You punk! You got yourself
in over your head on the internet.

726
00:56:37,727 --> 00:56:39,229
I'll be prepared.

727
00:56:45,068 --> 00:56:47,487
If you're on leave today,

728
00:56:47,570 --> 00:56:50,073
why are you here
instead of hanging out with your friends?

729
00:56:50,865 --> 00:56:52,450
It was a last-minute thing because of me.

730
00:56:53,701 --> 00:56:57,330
It didn't feel right
to take the bus back home last night.

731
00:56:58,123 --> 00:57:01,418
You're not a kid. Why would you ask him
to drive you all the way back home?

732
00:57:01,501 --> 00:57:03,795
I asked him to come.
I wanted to talk to him.

733
00:57:05,255 --> 00:57:06,464
I see.

734
00:57:31,531 --> 00:57:33,283
This is delicious.

735
00:57:34,909 --> 00:57:36,786
I'll head back to the dorm
once I'm done eating.

736
00:58:16,326 --> 00:58:17,535
Are you okay?

737
00:58:18,453 --> 00:58:19,871
How did things go at home?

738
00:58:20,914 --> 00:58:22,916
What about you? How did it go?

739
00:58:26,461 --> 00:58:27,712
I didn't get fired.

740
00:58:28,630 --> 00:58:29,839
That's great.

741
00:58:45,021 --> 00:58:46,231
Let's go for a drink.

742
00:59:01,162 --> 00:59:03,248
It's too loud in here. Let's go outside.

743
00:59:06,584 --> 00:59:08,211
Why? This place has a great vibe.

744
00:59:09,337 --> 00:59:10,755
Let's just have a bottle and go.

745
00:59:26,604 --> 00:59:27,438
Taeyang.

746
00:59:32,944 --> 00:59:34,112
Let's break up.

747
00:59:36,239 --> 00:59:37,156
What?

748
00:59:40,201 --> 00:59:41,369
Let's…

749
00:59:43,288 --> 00:59:44,414
break up.

750
00:59:58,428 --> 00:59:59,637
I…

751
01:00:03,308 --> 01:00:04,892
really liked you a lot.

752
01:00:22,368 --> 01:00:23,578
I liked you too.

753
01:00:25,788 --> 01:00:27,040
Thanks for everything.

754
01:01:28,518 --> 01:01:30,436
GOING TO YOU AT A SPEED OF 493KM

755
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:32,438
I broke up with Taejun.

756
01:01:32,522 --> 01:01:35,692
Everyone, I'm back!

757
01:01:35,775 --> 01:01:36,693
Taeyang!

758
01:01:36,776 --> 01:01:38,236
Taeyang is back.

759
01:01:38,319 --> 01:01:40,363
Are you in deep distress
because of our Taeyang?

760
01:01:40,446 --> 01:01:43,199
-"Our Taeyang"?
-You can say we're like besties.

761
01:01:43,282 --> 01:01:44,742
Did you have to be this mean?

762
01:01:44,826 --> 01:01:46,452
I'm getting swayed!

763
01:01:46,536 --> 01:01:48,871
Taeyang and your brother broke up.

764
01:01:48,955 --> 01:01:50,248
How do you feel?

765
01:01:50,832 --> 01:01:52,583
It's been a while since you held a racket.

766
01:01:53,126 --> 01:01:54,210
The leg is off.

767
01:01:55,211 --> 01:01:56,587
What?

768
01:02:07,515 --> 01:02:08,641
GOING TO YOU AT A SPEED OF 493KM

769
01:02:08,725 --> 01:02:10,727
